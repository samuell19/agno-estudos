Best wishes ! - Best wishes to her father! - Vincenzina, happy birthday! Here for you dear - Open it. How beautiful ! Thanks Dad. - Now you have to cut the cake. - Champagne! Champagne for us too! This way ! It's coming! Here it is. Drink! Don Antonio, I need to talk to you. Do you mind coming out? Is it true that you will testify against Dante Ragusa? - Does it surprise you? - You have got a very young daughter. Dante Ragusa does not scare anyone anymore! His time is over, luck has turned its back on him. - He's even less then a beggar! - If you say so! I've been told he still controls half the region... ... and has strong political connections. I'll tell you something else: Ragusa has become old. In the past he'd never touched 'dirty' money An he'll pay dearly the subdivision of the gulf. Everyone will understand who Antonio Gaburri is! Now ! - Aaah! - Don Antonio! Help, they shot him! Speed up. THE ENGINE DOES NOT START Something wrong, ma'am? - It won't start. - Maybe it needs a push. Put on the second gear. All right. Thank you. Tomorrow, don't come to testify or you could have some trouble! Greetings to your husband. Gentlemen, stand up, the Court enters. In the name of the Italian people the Tribunal of Trani... ... having read the article 275 of the Penal Code... ... and as a consequence of article 479 Code of Criminal Procedure... ... and articles 744 and 745, it acquits... OUTRAGED COMMENTS - Silence! ... Ragusa Pasquale of the charge of murder... ... and the other crimes ascribed to him, for not having committed the crime. It orders his immediate release... ... if not held for other reasons. The hearing is closed. We made it ! - You do not have to worry anymore. - Worry? This foolishness was organized only because of Jacovella, that pig! Do not get angry, sooner or later we'll nail him! Look at Jacovella's face! Surprised uh?! It's easy when all the witnesses are corrupted Here is Commissioner Jacovella! - I can not stand them ! - Also your wife was proved wrong by the Court. If you dare again, I'll smash your face! Got it? Let's go. > Maselli, Nino Ragusa was acquitted, Jacovella was pissed off. >Good! I'll put it in front page. > Should I write the article? > Only a report. > In two minutes I'll be there. - So, what do you think? - Good. Jacovella shouldn't be treated like that, you know what I think about the Ragusas! I would also like to see him in jail, but there was no evidence. They sent Nino to court only because and he's Dante's brother. - The motorboat was his. - Anyone could take it. - You always want to be right! - Of course! To work on the news, don't allow feelings overtake you You must follow the facts. It seems everyone is happy that Ragusa has been acquitted. I do not understand why ! He's a criminal! - Today's heroes are bandits. - Many of us saw the motorboat! Sometimes I feel like giving up everything. - It seems like you are the enemies of society! - Play, dad! - Are you ready ? - Yup. - Go! - On the radio, they talked about you. - I heard. - The newspapers want me transferred. - Why? - They're right, I was wrong. - In what, exactly? I didn't consider that the Ragusas can buy anyone, even judges ... and also Maselli. You have always said he is a good journalist. - I'm not so sure anymore! - Dad, play! We'll continue tomorrow. Now go to sleep. - Ugh! - He's right, it's late, you have to go to school tomorrow. - I'm going in the afternoon. - No, tomorrow you have the morning shift. - Dad, are you going out? - I have shifts too! - Will you be late? - Yes, do not wait for me. Dad, stay home, mom will sign out your note. - I can't. Goodbye! - Come on, let's go to bed. Otherwise you'll fall asleep in class like last week. - Who told you ? - The teacher. - What a spy! - What are you doing ? - Go away ! Put the knife away! What do you want to do ? Give me the knife! Stand still ! Do you know what will happen to you? You do not know? You will go from cigarettes to cars and then to banks! If I see you stealing again, I'll break your bones until you behave! Now go away! - Good morning, Dante, did you call me? - You are late! I was at the port, there was traffic. When I call you I do not want to wait. Keep it in mind, Nino! You have to go to Rome. Here are the permits. You know who has to sign them. Come back tomorrow. They told me you're angry with me. It was not my fault. They told me... ... that the officer had already taken bribes. That mistake cost me 220 million It was not all my fault, the works at the port were stopped... ... I had to find a solution while you were in Milan. Nino! Nicola! - I'm Pasquale Ragusa. - The undersecretary awaits you. - Let's get married soon. - You do not even have a job! Do not worry about money, Nadia, that's not a problem. - For me it is! - Smart people offered me a job. - We'll be able to get married soon. - I hope, Antonio! "Today has been granted to the real estate company Dante Ragusa... ... the contract for the construction..." - Going to Lecce? - No, Bari. - Put it on the back seat. - Thank you "The condition has come out of the blue." - Let's turn off this pain! Swedish? - No English. Is this the man? - Danilo, answer the gentleman! - Yes, it's him. Giordani, leave me two columns in the news and come here immediately. You can go, but let me know where I can find you. I'm a janitor at the Technical High School, you'll find me there. - Goodbye. - See you later. - Bye. - Let's go. - What's up ? - Read. - What is that ? - A medical report. Jacovella beat a minor. I want a title on three columns. Be harsh! Read what the newspapers write about you. - What do you have to say about this story? - It's true. you dare to admit it? The article doesn't say that the boy was stealing. I gave him some slaps that his father should have given him! I see. But be careful, Jacovella... I have the impression that the Gazzetta has targeted you. The sentiment is mutual. Try to be more diplomatic, to go against the press is wrong. - Half Bari Nuova was built by my company. - Interesting ! - Here we are at the toll booth. - Did you build this too? - No. - No, ANAS built it. - Good morning, Nino! - I'm in a hurry. - I do not have the change. - Ugh, these 100 liras! Here. - Thank you. Beggars! - If you want to continue for Lecce you have to get off here. - Thank you. - Come with me. - No ! You are too rich for a poor English girl. - Come and spend two days with me. - No, I prefer the Baroque in Lecce. - Thank you very much ! - (under his breathe) Fuck you! - All clear? - Yup. The van will arrive soon with the money and we get into action. - Frightened? Antonio. Here it comes. Now ! Hey! - Back off! - Give me the weapons! Stop! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Oh God! Antonio, run away! Let's split up. See you later at the monastery. - 113 here. - Four masked man attempted a robbery at an armored van. They killed a policeman. - Who is speaking? - I am the porter at the Rural Bank, Piazza Del Campo, 2. - Thanks. We're coming - To all police cars... ... four masked men tried to rob a van... ... and they killed a policeman. Car 320, go to Piazza Del Campo. > Received. Who got killed? > Negri Giovanni was on duty. - Poor man! Sooner or later it will happen to me. - You chose this job! > Here car 27. What do you know about those four? - They are dressed in the same way: blue blouse with fur collar... ... jeans and gray ski mask. That one. Shut up ! Look at those two! Brake! Stay still, you idiot! We won't do anything to you. - Help ! - Speed up! Speed up! SHOOTING > Here car 27. We have intercepted a Simca 1000 license plate Bari 344945. > Inside the car, there are two men dressed as described. > Where are you? > Casaletto area. We are heading to the industrial area. > Car 36, go to Casaletto area... ... intercept a Simca 1000 chased by car 27.> Received. - Help ! - Don't move! Whore! I'll handle that! - Leave me! - Bitch! Noo! Idiot! Can not you see where you are going? Get off ! Get off! You will pay for this! I swear! - Chief, there was a robbery. - Where? - At the Rural Bank. - ANSA is sending the news. - Send a reporter. - Alright. Move away! There is nothing to see. Move those people away! He had a son two days ago. This is the destiny of us all. Damn! Why are we doing this? I'll change my job! Stop it or I'll make you change your job! - Apologies. - Come, Jacovella. Calm down. Today they are nervous too. - Has the judge been warned? - Yes, but he comes whenever he wants. - Maybe it's better to cover the body - No! I want everyone to see him. "Bari is a besieged city since yesterday. All access roads are guarded by police and carabinieri. The impudence of crime has exceeded all limits. The bank was guarded by an armed guard... ... and by a public security agent." "The Commissioner of Bari, interviewed by the Gazzetta Del Mezzogiorno... ... stated that no car can get out of the city without a check. For the police the three criminals who carried out the robbery... ... killed 23-year-old agent Giovanni Negri... ... and thrown 27-year-old Maria Lobianco out of her car... ... are still in the city." BUSY LINE SIGNAL Was it necessary to write: "Under the nose of the police" '? That boy got himself killed to defend the interests of the people! What else do you want? - Go out! - Please, gentlemen... Remember: to be discouraged is like quitting the fight. They can say what they want, we do not care! Clear? I know it's hard! But people want facts and we have to give it to them! If we catch those criminals, maybe people will change their mind. All permits are suspended, we can forget about home and family. I hate journalists! Unbelievable! Everyone has their misfortunes! I had two: losing the sight and having an idiotic brother! The serious thing is that I have to trust you! I understand you let somebody steal your car.. ... but the bag no! - I... - Silence! Nicola! Find that car right away, I have to get my bag back! There is the letter from the Ministry. Fuck! He wants to drive us insane! I have not seen my family for two days. He hates journalists. If he were good with them, he would be vice Commissioner! If those people at the Gazzetta get angry, we are in trouble! - Do be ridiculous! How many people do you think read it? - Many! They send it to the Prosecutor for free! If they want to ruin us, it's over! Sorry, I have to give something to Jacovella. Inspector! They found it in the car used for the robbery. It's a club card. - What, what happened? - Come on ! - I can not leave work. Do not ask questions. Get in! Police! Nobody move! Look who's there! - How are you, Charlie? - Can't complain. Everything is all right. Beautiful women, beautiful city, whiskey... - Except for the face of... - Fuck face! Yes, right, fuck face! Turini, bring this bag of shit to the police station. - Let's go. - Charlie, get up. Please, be careful he doesn't fall from the stairs. Come on, Charlie. We'll take you by car! - Good morning. - License, please. - What's happening? - A check. I need to run to my father right away. He was hospitalized, it is very serious. I see. - All right, let him go. Best wishes for your father. - Thank you. - Thank you. Come in. - This is not the hospital! - You said to bring him here. - - I wanted Charlie. - It's him, Inspector. Charlie? What happened to you! What happened to him? No, do not tell me! - Did you fall down the stairs? - We should have them repaired. You already know the game: I ask the questions and you give the answers. Whenever you are wrong, you pay penance! We find the card of a private club... ... we come and we find you. - Does not this seem strange to you? - I have my rights. - I answer only to the magistrate. - Charlie! This is not an interrogation, it's just a conversation between friends. Old friends ! It's here. Let's go. Hurry up ! It was my grandmother's house. She died a year ago. Nobody comes here anymore. Can you explain now what's going on? I killed a man. - A policeman. - What ? - You heard me! How could you do such a thing? I was afraid. I was afraid. When I saw him in front of me, armed... Perhaps he was more afraid then me. I told myself... ... "Here it goes, now he catches me." For a moment I saw everything black... ... I felt my breath fail. Mario shouted: "Shoot!" I pulled the trigger without noticing it. All that blood! So I just thought about running away! It seemed so easy! In a few seconds you find millions in your pocket! I've never seen a million! Do not leave me alone. You're the only one I can count on. If you leave me too, it's the end. It's already the end, Antonio! But I will be next to you. - The team, soon. - Right away. "The latest bloody events worry the population. At the Prefecture they say that something is happening... ... even if officials do not talk about this story... ... that brought the police to trial. All the underworld has been searched... ... and more than a hundred people were interrogated yesterday. Inspector Jacovella has declared..." - Fuck you! If they catch us, they'll kill us! Give me a beer. UNCLEAR NOISE - What's happening ? - Shut up ! I hear noises. Shh! Don't move ! Drop the machine gun. - Where's the fourth one? - Who ? - Where's the fourth? - What? What the fuck are you saying? You do not know ? This is for the policeman and this for the girl! Inspector! We've got it now. We should make him stop wanting to kill cops! We'll deal with it. It's all yours! Take a seat. I agree with you, but this one will only cause you trouble. I want those people to know that we won't let them kill us! As you want. - Here, Dr. Maselli. - I have no money, note it please. - All right. - Hi, Giordani. - Hello. - Have you been to the police headquarters? - Yes. What is Jacovella saying? Vittorio, here it is. - He's angry with you. - Really ? - He says he will make you pay! If you talk to one of his people... ... let them know that I got my precautions. I do not go to bed with the minors, only with the oldies... ... even if it's less fun! - I hear you! Tell him also about my jacket. Look! - I have all the pockets sewn. - Come on! - You never know! Someone could think... ... to stash drugs in my pockets. - Dr. Maselli, the phone. - I can not even eat in peace! - Will they catch the killers? - If they find them. Hello? It's me. I'll be right there. They took them, happy? - Giordani, let's go, Jacovella cought them. - Dead? Don't know. At the police station they started the interrogations. TELEPHONE RINGS - Hello? - Anna, it's me, I do not come for lunch and maybe not even for dinner. All right. You come and go in the house like a meteor... ... but at least give me your news often. Call me if you can. Be careful, be cautious, you bother too many people. - Bye. - Bye. FREE LINE SIGNAL> Don Ragusa. - Please wait. - Yes? Who is it ? A friend. The man who stole the car from your brother is called Antonio Blasi. He lives in Via Alcamo, 18. Antonio Blasi. He lives in Via Alcamo, 18. - Dr. Maselli? Yes? - I have news worth 200 thousand lira. I know who killed the policeman: the fourth of the band. - 200,000 lira are fine. - His name is Antonio Blasi. He is 25 years old. He was arrested once for the theft of a car. - Do you know a guy named Antonio Blasi? - He lives there, but he's not there. - Is his father there? - No, the police took him away this morning. the Police ? Give me the Press Room of the Police Station Is that you, Giordani? Have you got updates on the identity? There is a description of eyewitnesses. - What does he look like ? - Skinny, standard height... ... high forehead, black eyes almond-shaped... ... dark eyebrows, sharp cheekbones. - Do they know his name? - They haven't told us that yet. All right, I leave you two columns in the news. Go to this address immediately to look for this guy. If he's not there, look for him everywhere. No thanks. - We must find him before Jacovella. - All right. Blasi's father was not taken by the carabinieri nor the police. - Where's Blasi? - I want a doctor! - Where's Blasi? - I do not know! I want a doctor! The sooner you speak, the sooner you will have a doctor. - Smoke. - You're a son of a bitch! - Check the tip off I got on the car stolen by Blasi. - Right away. We can not, we must warn the police. Warn the police? I'd rather eat this picture! If we publish the photo, we alert the criminal. By publishing his photo, perhaps I save him. - Where's Antonio? Where is your son? - I do not know. I swear I do not know! - You know me ? - Yes. Then you also know that I honor my word Tell me where your son is, we will not harm him. I do not know, I have not seen him since the day of the robbery. If I knew where he's hiding I'd tell you. I swear to the Most Holy Virgin, I do not know where my son is. - Believe me, Don Ragusa! - Nicola. No! No! Leave me! No ! Leave me! No ! Let me go! Aaah! Our informant confirms that he escaped with a white Alfa. No one reported the theft that day. No, I think he's still in the city. - He did not take a cent from the robbery - Right He comes from a poor family He has no money, nobody will do anything to help him. Better for us! - Sir, the draft. - No, there's no time. Hurry up! Come on ! Come on! Jacovella, take this! Thank you. Do not they understand that by posting his photo they are warning him? They only did it to sell more copies. They would spit in their mothers' face just to sell more! They are creating a hunting atmosphere, I hope nobody else will get killed "Dear Dante, here are the signed building permits for you" "The projects have not been approved yet, but you can start the work." "The opposition will fight..." "... against demolishing the baroque buildings of the historic center." "Send me the money on the account of the Cassa Rurale Artigiana, Lugano." - Antonio, there's your picture in the newspaper. - Impossible! What are we going to do now? Nothing. Nothing. Perhaps there is a solution. - Was this in the car? - Yes, it's not yours? No. - There's something that will take us far. - What do you mean ? I'll explain later, now I have to find a phone. Wait for me here. Is it clear? I want two tickets for Caracas and ten million. - No surprises or I'll send everything to the newspaper. - When and where ? At Castel Del Monte at five. A man, alone. "The photo published in the Gazzetta has shocked the police. The city council got involved, and the Congressman Giuliani... ... presented an interpellation to understand how a journalist... ...can find out about a killer before the police does. The Deputy Head of Police just said that all the men of the police station... ... are mobilized for the research... - Yes I know him. - He has not been here for a long time. - He's your relative, is not he? No, he's my wife's nephew. We need your help, you should come to the police headquarters. - I'm sorry. - I will be right back. - Careful! - Ah! Nadia, take the suitcase! Run! Aaah! Ah! Ah! I'm ready. Call me if the hunt goes on, or if they kill him. - I have the page ready. - There is also the possibility that they catch him alive. No I do not think so ! If they catch him, Blasi is a dead man. "Blasi killed." - Thank you. - You are welcome. This boat will be fine. - To do what? - Nothing. To wait. They will not find us here. Why do you hate Jacovella so much? He believes he can solve the city's problems with an iron fist. - He has rough justice methods. - He's in good faith. - I know. I go after him because I respect him. This city has the port and the fair. It is an important business center. There is also dirty business, but people must be informed, educated. - Not kicked in the ass! - People are not willing to accept everything. People are now confused. We have to open their eyes through the newspaper. They believe in everything to safeguard their peace of mind. They will welcome the boy's destruction almost with relief... ... who will eventually pay for everyone, even for Ragusa. This time it must not happen! You and Jacovella look like two dogs on a bone. He will be publicly destroyed. But I got the bag back. Yes, you got the bag. But that little criminal is still alive! Once we had professional ethics . I'll take care of that son of a bitch! - Do you know where to find him? - Maybe yes. Kill him! Or maybe I should have him work for me. Now, go away. - What can I do for you, Don Ragusa? - I want to talk to the Minister. Is Mr Maselli there? It's Antonio Blasi speaking. It's him. Record the conversation. - I'm sorry. What were you saying? - I want to talk to you tonight. No surprises, or I'll start shooting. You can trust me. Tell me where... A moment, I'll write it. Tell me. Yes, I know where it is. - I will have a copy of the newspaper under my arm. - I trust you. Walk and shut up. Here it is. This is the whole truth. I want my father's murderers to be caught. - How do you know who they are? - A very powerful man is involved. - I know something that will destroy him. - Ragusa? Do not you want to tell me? I will help you on two conditions. You turn yourself in. And the girl has to come with me. No, I will not come. I'll stay with Antonio. As you want. But it's dangerous. If you told me the truth, it's not just the police looking for Antonio. Between Jacovella and Ragusa I do not know who is worse for him. Try to convince her. I'll wait for you call "Blasi wants to turn himself in." He's afraid ! After you killed his father. Give me a cigar! People must be scared off, not killed, idiots! The only good one is the journalist. We must monitor him. Day and night. Got it? It's very important. That journalist will meet Blasi again. How can you not get it? You are such a fool! You don't have the nerve to do it, Nino! Because you are a coward! Call Nicola. - He wants you. - Ok. Watch over him. Hey, so you interview killers now! Why don't you get my place, a become the Head of the Patrols! No, thank you, my job is already quite "disgraced"! What are you aiming at? You are playing too dangerous a game. The truth is that you are bothered because Blasi got in touch with me. Now that everyone knows he wants to turn himself in, you can not kill him anymore. Bullshit! You dug his grave with that article! Who killed his father will tail you. Do you understand you're in trouble? I wish you luck, Director. Watch your hands. (from the headphones) Dr. Maselli, I need to talk to you again. Let's meet tonight at the usual place. Call Inspector Jacovella, we intercepted a phone call. Yes, of course, the team! Notify all the patrols. No cars in the area or at checkpoints. Maselli must walk easily. He must not see us. Let's not make mistakes. It is an unrepeatable opportunity, we must exploit it right. Turini? Yes. Not appeared yet. If he walks through here, we'll see him for sure. - The important thing is that he does not see you. - Of course. A car is approaching. It has stopped. Can you see who is driving? No. Now I see it, it's Maselli - Which way is he going? - He is coming forward. - Do not let him see you. - Yes. VAGUE NOISE Let's go. There he is. He is alone ! No, there is someone following him. It is Blasi. What do we do? - Action ! WHISTLES Stop or I'll shoot! Stop! It's Nino Ragusa, it isn't Blasi. So you managed to get even with Nino Ragusa. Go away ! I do not want to talk to an idiot like you! You know I'm right! You knew that Ragusa would have tailed me. You told me! Now it is legally a corpse. Very good! People find it strange. There was an outstanding fight between you and Ragusa. - So? - A shooting takes place for Blasi and Ragusa dies? - Who says it's strange? People or journalists? - It's the same ! It's not true ! Rather, ask Maselli what he was doing there! - We are not discussing here the role of the Press... - Isn't it that for interests ... you are protecting a criminal! The man we killed was armed. What scares us is your clear will to get even If they killed one of you, you would claim the killer's head. Maybe, but we must try to be unbiased. Not me! PEOPLE PRAYING Inspector Jacovella is here. Why did you come? We are allowed to disrespect the living... ... not to dead, Inspector Jacovella! Nicola. "Today the funeral of Pasquale Ragusa was celebrated... ... killed by the police by mistake as declared by the police itself. This morning there was a meeting at the Region's headquarters ... to discuss whether an inspector with a fast gun... ... Dr. Jacovella... ... can continue to hold such a delicate role." Take a seat. - What has Antonio decided? - He's afraid. He believes that you want to betray him too. No ! I have nothing to do with tonight's shooting I just wanted to mislead the police. I knew they were following me. - Would you like something? - A lemon tea. A lemon tea. - Antonio must trust me. - He does not trust anyone anymore. He is sure they will kill him. He killed a policeman! Maybe you think he deserves it too. What I think does not matter. But I want him to have a legal trial. - You must help me convince him. - Whatever happens to Antonio... ... I will be with him! - Dr. Maselli! - Leave me alone! Do not you knock anymore? - I have very little time. - Me too. For me our chat is already over. Order the men who follow me to go home. - You must be crazy! - I've never been so lucid. Blasi will come to the newspaper with his girlfriend. You understood correctly: he's turning himself in When he comes to me I'll call you and you come get him. Without shootings or corpses! Thus public opinion will be satisfied. Public opinion! - Do not make me laugh ! - Precisely so, dear Inspector. We are the ones to shape public opinion... ... not you and your machine guns! It's better for everyone, even for you. He's just a frightened boy. Remember it well: if you kill him, I'll destroy you! Now you give us the orders, we only get killed. FREE LINE SIGNAL Maselli, it's Jacovella. I had the area cleared by all patrols. But now listen to me, I know this job very well. It's a mistake to do everything by yourself. - No. - What if I come there alone? - You must stay out of it. - Let us arrest him. - No ! I gave my word. HORN - Hi, Nadia. - Hello. - Are you scared ? - Yes a bit. NON-AUDIBLE VOICES - Here it is. - Thank you. Here we are ! Now we can only hope that everything goes well. Two articles are ready: "Blasi turns himself in" and "Blasi gets killed". NON-AUDIBLE VOICES - I'm going first. - All right. Keep this. It is a photocopy of the Minister's letter. If something happens to me... ... give it to the police. Go. - Where is he? - In the car. Here I am. Now deliver him to me. Antonio! Call the ambulance. Antonio! There's nothing left to do. NADIA CRIES - He's dead. Nicola! Nicola! Nicola. Nicola, where are you? Nicola.
