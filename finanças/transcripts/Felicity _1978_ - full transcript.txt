At Willow's End, the rest of the world seemed far away. At that time, any talk or action concerning sex was discouraged. But that didn't stop some of us from thinking about it, almost constantly. Often early in the morning I would lie awake and think what it would be like. Jenny, Jenny, wake up! What time is it? - It's nearly 6 o'clock. Ooh. Boy, was I having a funny dream. Come on, let's go. We're late already. I always loved the ballet classes. They were hard work, but as l stretched my leg on the bar, I felt the pull of muscles, the nerves that carried the messages to every part of my breasts and the muscles of the stomach. I wanted always to have the feeling of my body awake and vibrant, eager and moving. It was like embracing the whole world, reaching out for something I could not yet define. Something I called love and did not yet know. Come on, get your gear off. You'll miss out on all the hot water if you don't. When I was just a child, my body was as straight as a little boys. Then I began to grow up. I began to look at the other girls, sneaking a look when they were dressing or showering. And I saw how lovely they were. I wanted to touch their bodies and to feel their soft and glowing skins. Hurry along there. I should thought you'd been out by now. Then I realized that my body was like that, too. That I was becoming a woman. My hands wandered over those new breasts of mine and across my thighs. And into that new valley between my thighs, where first a gentle down and then a rich soft fleece was growing, hiding a secret place that I barely thought about. I began to feel proud of my body. How do you think? - Careful. Hey wait for me, what is it? Yes! - What? I come between. - What are you doing, stupid? It was then I realized my body was attractive to other people, too. And it gave me a new sensation. It's hot today, isn't it? - Yes, it is. Will the fish bite today? - I do not know. Come on, Jenny. Let's get wet! Hey, look at this. In the holidays, I worked for one of those small country stores. Mr. Jacobs, the grocer, made me aware, that it wasn't only young boys, who are interested in me. Need any help, though? No, thank you. Is there a Miss Felicity Robinson here? Come on, smarty pants. Give it to me! Come on. Don't keep it a secret. Who is it from? What? | get to go to Asia for my holiday. - Oh, can I go? My father's arranged for me to stay with friends of his in Hong Kong. Of course you can't come. There's only one ticket and it's for me. Goodbye. I'll miss you. I'll miss you, too. Goodbye, Jenny. What happened on that plane was just like what I'd been reading in that book "Emmanuelle". Because I had never experienced this before. I felt quite shocked, but I strained to hear every sound. My nipples hardened and every part of my body seemed to ache. I felt a warm tingling in my most sacred place. And it reminded me of one night in our dormitory back at school. This heat, I can't sleep either. You're glistening all over. Go, please touch me. Want to reach out and touch me? Yes, plenty of times. Now they stand up. Perhaps I should have felt guilt then and now, but I felt only unashamed pleasure. And I thought to myself: "Why fight a biological reaction?" Ms. Felicity Robinson? Ms. Christine sent to pick you up. She apologised, but she cannot be here. But hopes you will be happy for me to take your tour. The first time you come to Hong Kong? Yes, it's beautiful. It looks fascinating. Hong Kong is many things to many people, as you will see and learn. Darling. I knew you would once. You're so much like your father. I hope not. No man could look as enchanting as this. Hello. Excited - Terrified. Terrified? It's just that overnight all this. Yesterday I was at school. In fact, for as far back as I can remember, I've always been at school. One sort or another. Always exclusive, of course. And always out of the way. I've learned to be the perfect young lady. I can speak several languages. I know all about the repeal of the Crown Laws. The ballet, the opera But nothing's prepared me for this. The things happen here that you'd never dream of. What sort of things? - Everything. Anything And all of it very exciting. Don't believe a word of what she says. What am I going to do with so many flowers? Stephen does nothing by halves. The crazy fool. I love him. You've swept him off his feet. He's enchanted. Don't be silly, Christine. I will face up to it Felicity. You inflicted by a serious handicap. Your irresistible beauty. Sure, when I look like this. I'm going to take a hot bath and go to bed, I think. That's my exit line. I'll get your things ready. You've had a long day, darling. It's been a wonderful day. I'm so tired. I'm beginning to realize how sheltered my life has been. Now your time is coming. You can't stay innocent in Hong Kong for too long. The first thing we have to do is get you some new clothes. These are positively prehistoric. Tomorrow we pay a visit to Adrian. Who's Adrian? - Ah, you'll just love Adrian. But that's tomorrow. You get some sleep now. Good night. Sleep tight, kitten. Good night, Christine. When I heard Christine and Stephen and I felt happy for them and l envied Christine having a man to come home to her. I wondered what it would be like having a man in bed with you, whenever you wanted. Reaching out and knowing there was another body at your side. I knew what I was doing was very wrong, but I wanted to watch them together. I'm so envious of Christine. Now, I wanted a man to feel my body like that. Because, I had never done it before. The very thought frightened me. But at the same time, it gave me an indescribable thrill. For I knew that one day soon I would do what Christine was doing now. And I knew that I wanted to do it soon. Christine. Darling, darling, darling, darling. Adrian! 0h, darling, you naughty, naughty, naughty little girl. For neglecting me for so long. I want you to meet someone. Felicity, this enchanting creature is my dear friend Adrian. Darling, we need your help. Not another little word! Into my little den and get it all off! How dit they look? - Beautiful. Is the fit okay? Yes, the fit's all right, but the color's all wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. For you, my little devil, it's got to be black. Oh, Perfect. Perfect, perfect, perfect. What about the Bra? Absolutely, and that's got to be black, too. Darling, I have some exquisite nightwear, you must see. Positively delectable. He's so cunning. He makes you feel extravagantly naughty and loving it. Is he a homosexual? - I can never be sure. Seems to enjoy his work so much. That was not fair! At least I taught her how to play tennis at that school. She beat you! You owe me a drink. I'm about to have a shower. And besides, I let her win. You go and get me another drink. I give in. I give in. Another drink for you, my sweet? No, thanks. I'm going to have a bath. I'll be 5 minutes. You girls will just have to contain your lust until I return. Love each other very much. - Yes, I think so. It's obvious. Even the way you rough him up. It must be nice. - What? Roughing him up? No, to have a man. - Oh, I see. Christine, I can't think of anything else. Every waking moment. Even in my dreams. Darling, don't be so solemn about it. - What's it like? Fantastic, but don't be so eager. Just let it happen. I can't wait. That's not bad, is it? Of course not. You go off and have your bath and stop worrying. Now, madam, can I have my shower? After Felicity has finished her bath? Certainly. Oh, what a pity. We could have had one together. Stephen, is Andrew Jackson back in town? Yes, he got back from the States last week. Is there anything else you want from inside? - No, thank you. I saw Steven and I knew he was out there watching me. It gave me a new thrill and pleased me to know that he found me attractive. So I let him watch and even moved my body to a position where he would be able to see it better, but not know that I was aware of him. Hi, Beautiful. Felicity, meet Me Ling. Hello! Hi. Christine tells me, it's your very first time here. Hello Me Ling. She's beautiful. - Yes, and very mysterious. She's the daughter of a wealthy Chinese merchant. And she could have anything she wants, but she chooses to live in the world of Hong Kong. She is a real volatile character. That man over there, is staring at me. Who? Oh, Andrew. Yes, he did his eye on you. All my friends lost after him. Well, you're a big girl now. You enjoy yourself. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. What brings you to Hong Kong. - Just good fortune, I guess. I'm staying with Christine and Stephen over there. The trip is a gift from my father. - Well, I'm aware to thanks, don't we? Listen. You like bright lights and fancy cars? Yes, why? - Come with me. Where are we going? - You'll see. What are you wearing under that dress? Just suspenders and panties. Take them off. - What? Do what I say! Now the panties. Please do as I say. Nothing will happen. You would enjoy it. With your bare ass on the leather. Now I want you to lay back on the car, lift your skirt and spread your legs slightly. When are you coming in for a swim? - Never. I'm not used to all this. Swimming pool, servants This is really bliss. I'm glad you're enjoying yourself here. How did you like last night? The party was terrific. Are you a little unhappy about something? Was it good for you the first time? Sex, I mean. No, it was clumsy and embarrassing. But then I've had plenty of practice since. Did you and Andrew do something last night? It's not all good looks that make a good lover, you know. Was it the first time for you? - Yes I remember my first time. Not because it was good, but because I was shy and innocent. It's all over in a few minutes. But don't worry. There are other times, other places, and most importantly, other men. Just enjoy life and stop worrying. Don't be afraid to experiment and find something new. Christina, I saw you and Steven making love. The first night I was here. I watched through the slats in the door. Does that make you angry? In fact, it turns me on, just a little. Here is Me Ling. I thought you'd like to spend some time with her. That would be lovely. Good, then it's settled. Me Ling can show you many places. You'll find Hong Kong more interesting than anything I could show you. Well, would you like to come with me for a few days? Okay. Well. What did you think of Hong Kong? Interesting place, don't you agree? It's beautiful, but contradictory. I don't understand what you mean. Up there on the Peak are fabulous, wealthy looking houses. And owned by many wealthy people, too. Down here, the "Water-People" are so poor. So many kinds of people in Hong Kong. There is sadness and there is beauty, side by side. I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse. Well, in Hong Kong, we have chicken, pork, fish, but I'm afraid no horse. Where are we going now? - Please follow me. I've been reading a book about "Emmanuelle". She has three attitudes to life and sex. And then looks at this book called "The Story of O". And in that, women are totally submissive. Emmanuelle says that Oriental people, know all about love and sex and eroticism. Is that true? - Oh, I don't really know. Maybe I can show you a few places right here in Hong Kong that would, well, to say the word whenever you like. What about right now? - Okay. What is this place? Don't be afraid. We're going to take a bath, like you never had before. Hong Kong is beautiful at night. Wonderful. Where are we going now? Well, I'm not quite sure you're ready for this. I'm ready for anything. Anything? - Anything! Well, all right. Where does this boat take us? Nowhere. This is my place of work. Sometimes my home. You can come aboard. But don't be shocked at what you see. What is this place? This is Chinese house of pleasure. You may watch and no one will try and touch you. If you wish to partake in some of the secret pleasures, you may do so. Come with me. Again, I felt a strange sense of danger and forbidden excitement, which turned me on incredibly and made me feel very moist between the legs as I watched what happened on board the junk that night. Later Me Ling me about her ways to give pleasure to a man. How she would bathe and cover him and fragrant oils. I could see that Asian women traded the pleasure of men with the utmost importance. It was then that I experienced one of the most erotic occurrences of my life up to that point. Perhaps it was the danger of somebody seeing us, that turned me on. A man made love to me. A man whom I didn't even know. While I looked at my friend doing the same thing with another man she didn't know. To think of it now would fill me with a mixture of shame and pleasure. Shame, because I knew it was immoral, but pleasure because it felt so good. Me Ling, what are you doing here? Oh, now you know my secret. - Who are these people? This is my other home. These people are refugees from the mainland. I helped them because they're very poor. I want this to be our secret. Oh, Me Ling. This is my fortune teller. She's very dear to me. She says you're very beautiful. Thank you. I must go now and visit some other families. Do you want to come with me? No. I better go back and call Christine, then get some sleep. Some real sleep, I mean. Not like last night. Okay. We'll meet again soon then. Thank you for showing me your Hong Kong. Are you all right, there? - Some men are chasing me. I do not see anyone. - But there are more of them. Come on board, quick! Well, like all self-respecting cowards, we piss off. Where are we going? - Horne. Where's that? - Oh, right over that direction, probably. That's was good. Don't worry. Well, this is home. Sorry Its all cold up for me a little bit. Could I impose on you to give me a little hand upstairs? How can I refuse? So begins the journey to the 22nd floor. Madam, you realize you're quite safe. Yes, I know. I think I'm too drunk to even raise a finger. Yes, I know. What a wonderful way to get to know you. And this is my bed. And doesn't it look beautiful? Good morning. Thank you. I'm afraid the morning's been gone. What time is it, then? - Oh, a bit after three. Oh, dear. You really needed that sleep. How long have you been up? - Oh, I guess an hour. I've been watching you. - Really? If you catch someone in the moment of waking up, sometimes, just for an instant, you see them exactly as they were when they were a baby. That's nonsense. I know, but it sounded good, didn't it? No, to tell the truth, I couldn't wait to find out who you are. Oh, yes. Last night. Last night. I'm afraid I don't remember very much about it. You're a complete mystery. I know nothing about you. You know that I like orange juice, and you know that I seem to attract Chinese attackers. Now, all I have to do is fill in the details. Tell me, what are you doing for the next couple of days? Spending them with you, I think! I'd better call Christine and tell her I'll be away for a few days and get her to send me some extra clothes. Not too many, I hope. And so it was. We filled in all the details of each other. We talked about our lives. I learned from Miles that he worked as an adventure photographer, but really, I learned more than that. I got to know him as a person. Something happened that I think is very nice. We became friends before we became lovers. I don't know how you about it. - What? You're sitting opposite a man, with a very mean reputation. Really? Before you came along I was known as the youngest dirty old man in the whole of Hong Kong. And probably including the Pacific. - I like this story. Now here I am sitting opposite of high voltage delightful, swapping biographies, when we should be swapping positions in bed. This mustn't get around you understand? -You're a Clown. Yeah. That's probably because I'm not going to say what I really feel. You can't say what you feel. I know how to say it in Chinese. It's just that l have trouble with the English. Eat your food. Do not move. I want us to make love together. Honey, in three days, I leave for a job at Tchong Chau. Well, then let's not waste any time. I choked on the rice. Let's get into the prawns. Well, as long as you put it like that, I can't really refuse. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Miles. I feel so horny. Yes, let's watch this film. Damn. What dou you say if we go back to the hotel. I did ask what you're thinking about. Play a Game. You mean here? Why not? I like a little bit of danger. You are a rascal. Perhaps we should start by taking off your pants. I'm so randy. Let's do it here. Let's get interrupted again. And we're almost there. I can't stand it any longer I can't wait a minute more. But a minute is a long time to get to the 22nd floor. What you think? Can we do it in the lift? If we get one to ourselves, I'll give it a try. Hell. Come on, Miles, I don't care if anyone comes. I can guarantee that one of us will. Going down? - Yes, after you. Thank you. Oh, what a lovely couple. I fancy you with a beard. You look very pretty. Am I not pretty now? My father had a beard. It was almost white. I still loved to feel the bristles. Pick me up in his arms and I push my face into it. I felt beautiful. He used to bring me these boiled lollies. They were monstrous. They were so big, I couldn't put them in my mouth. I remember, | used to call them gob stoppers. He'd sucked them down. Until they were just the right size. And then he'd bend over and kiss me. What's so funny? - You, my little rabbit. Well the time has come. We'll see each other again soon. You'll phone me, won't you? - Of Course I want. Will it be okay if I'm gone? My dear, I'm only gone for a couple of weeks. Miss Me Ling await you inside. - Would you send her in please? Come in. Hey, whats wrong? Christine and Stephen have gone up to Macao for a few days. She told me you were feeling pretty down when you phoned her yesterday. If you like, we can go up to Macao to see her. I don't know, Me Ling. Wait and see what I feel like in a couple of days. Would you like me to stay with you? Yes. That would be good. That guy really got to you, huh? That's beautiful. Did he give you that? Me Ling, in a few days, lwant to go to a place called Cheung Chau to find Miles. Where you come with me? Cheung Chau that's not too difficult. Did he tell you where he was actually going to work? I've got something written down, but I think it's just a mailing address. Don't expect he thought I'd try and visit him there. But I will Cheung Chau is a pretty wild place, I'm told. I've never been there. What sort of photographic assignment is he doing? A secret, he wouldn't tell me. Oh, great. I'll give us all of Cheung Chau to search, but at least we can try it. Come on. Don't worry. We'll find him, we've only been here one day. We're looking all the nightspots tonight. They say this place really jumps up. I Just hope we can find Miles. Me Ling, do you think we'll be able to find him in a place like this? Well, we can try. Idon't think I can watch this anymore. It's far too hedonistic. What is hedonistic? It's pleasure, for pleasure sake. Well, what's wrong with that? Well, kid, I'm off to find some action. I'll see you back here later. If not I went back to the hotel. Okay. I hope I can find my way back there. Can I buy you a drink? What? - A drink. What's your poison? Bacardi and Coke. You want a tour arround? Yes, why not? You want to do it here? Why not? - Why not? But did you enjoy that? Yes, but in a different way. Physically, but not emotionally. It was very erotic, though. That sounds rather hedonistic. Honestly, I didn't even know his name. It reminds me of a book I once read called "Fear of Flying". In that the author termed a similar occurrence the zipless fuck, because you only have two zippers, you know, his and hers, and it's no names and you never meet again. Wow, that sounds really wild. You've certainly changed since your arrival here. But we haven't found Miles yet. Oh, but I have, though. At least I've seen him. Well, why didn't you say so? For goodness sake. Where is he? Thank you. "Your friend is in the house of Kan Suet in Tai O." Me Ling! Me Ling! Me Ling! Wake up! 1111133! Miles, what happened? Hallo Rabbit. What happened? I had an argument with a serpent. Miles, stop it. A sea snake. I'll get you a doctor. - No, no, I'll be I'll be okay. The fisherman gave me one of his potions. They say, usually it works. I've seen a doctor anyway. You look lousy. Don't move! You know, for the last couple of days, I just thought you are someone, I'd imagine. You know what? I was in the fever. Now I know you're really here. Stop talking. Let's make love. Some people go through their lives having sex without affection or others affection without sex. My time with Miles taught me that the two must go together. How about - Don't speak Miles. Actions speak much louder than words. Boy, I love the way you swear at me now. Tell me, what have you been up to since I've been gone? I haven't exactly been the picture of innocence. I must admit, I've sampled my fair share of delights, too. Miles. I think I could stay with you forever. Why don't we talk about that tomorrow? So let's enjoy today first.
