You've got people who see something. It can create instantaneous ramping of fear, frenzy, concern, in a community. You typically would see that kind of situation around serial rape, serial murders. I can tell you that it creates grave concerns on our part because what we don't want is people to be subsequently injured in an assault, or murdered. Where somebody claims that they felt threatened, or this frenzy just kinda takes over and people start behaving in ways that they would not otherwise behave. Oh, my God. I didn't know this was really real. Then why did you hide under that girl's bed that one time? I know you really don't kill, you just show up at people's houses. Hi, Wrinkles. This is NBC 2 in Fort Myers. We're just seeing your story really blow up online. Meet Southwest Florida's Wrinkles the Clown. A creepy clown named Wrinkles offered to terrorize naughty children for cash. Hi, I have a child that's misbehaving pretty bad. If you give me a call back at... You can't miss his red and white polka dot suit. Hi, Wrinkles, I'm a reporter at the Washington Post. I was hoping to interview you for a story about your, uh... your amazingness. I found this guy named Wrinkles the Clown. And he's a guy on Craigslist who you can call, and apparently, he'll come to your address and scare children. He makes me think I'm going to die. Hello, you've reached Wrinkles the Clown. No, I'm not here to take your call. Leave me a message and I'll call you back. Wrinkles, I'm a reporter at the Naples Daily News. You're scaring little people that can't defend themselves. Could have been a child molester. I've never seen you in real life, but I love your YouTube videos. I'm so excited to leave this message for you. Please call me back. Wrinkles is easily and often spotted around town. Here he is in Downtown Fort Myers and it's the Collier County fair. Hey, Wrinkles. Was writing a story about you and I was interested in that thing you had with that little girl that was on YouTube. If you haven't seen this video, good luck going to sleep tonight. I mean, seriously. He was lurking under the bed of a sleeping little girl. He goes by Wrinkles, but you may know him by his other name, Person of Interest. Uh... I'm calling from CAA which is a talent agency - in Los Angeles. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Hey Wrinkles, are you hiding in my friend's backyard, because we saw a clown that looks exactly like you. This is the County Sheriff's Department. I just wanted to call you to verify that you're not allowed out on Halloween night. If you are found or seen by any kids, you'll be arrested on site.- Is that Wrinkles the Clown? No! Let me take a picture with him. Come on, man. Dude, he's a legend. What the fuck? Wrinkles walks by and the whole thing. What I saw was like a little flyer or pamphlet on a post and I was walking home from work one day, and it had him, and his name, and his number, and I was like, "Dude, I'm gonna try to call this, you know, phone number, get a hold of him," it goes right to his voicemail. I'm like... so I call him over and over again, he finally picked up. It was the coolest thing 'cause it was, you know, actually him saying, - "Hey, what's going on?" - I love what he's doing. It brings a spark, an energy, to the neighborhood. And... how many times do we bring it up to people alone, you know? Just be afraid of this. You can't be afraid of Jason. It's fiction. You can't be afraid of, you know, that Carrie, but you better be afraid of Wrinkles. - He's real. - Wrinkles, it's like... That's been awesome. He's real. Hi, you've reached Wrinkles the Clown. I'm not here to take your call. Leave me a message and I'll call ya back. Wrinkles, this is Jack's father. You got to see me. He's been acting up. - Daddy. - If they don't stop acting up, I'm gonna give you my address to come and get these little motherfuckers. No! Do you wanna see what he looks like? No. Look, this is what he look like. - No! - Sorry. I'm sorry. My kids' names are Angelina and Mia. Please just calm down, Mia. He says he needs the TV. He thinks he'll come out this motherfuckin' TV. Hey, um, Wrinkle, I need you to come get these badass kids - like I'm... - No! Oh, it's fine. He's been like a madman. Personal vengeance and shame they are. However, uh, did you have much trouble getting here? Just hold your breath. If it is right... You know, uh, I'll probably never unmask myself. I don't wanna be hassled. I get hassled enough with the phone calls, things like that. I don't need kids recognizing me on the street, you know. I'm not going to talk you in my real voice either. You want Wrinkles, you're gonna get Wrinkles, you know, including the voice. But we'll not attack again, unless there's... - You're not. - I get... I get hundreds and hundreds of voicemails a day. The whole viral thing for me is, uh... It's kind of a pain in the ass. Everybody and their fucking grandmother has my phone number. Jesus Christ. Uh, I get moms and dads that call and ask whose number this is 'cause they see the number in the kids' phone, and they wanna know who it is, you know. Uh, you get kids that call and are like, "Hey, we love you, Wrinkles" and all that good stuff. Then you got your legit parents out there that really are looking for some, uh, behavioral services. My favorite kind of scares are the ones that pay the most. You know, I'll show up outside in the backyard, you know, maybe give a knock on the window and, you know, make sure they see me and give them a wave, but, you know, I'm not wielding, uh, knives and machetes, and things like that. I give the parents my sticker, I say, "Oh, you put the sticker up here in the fridge." Maybe tell them, "Hey", you misbehave again, Wrinkles is gonna come back. There's his phone number right now, "I'll call him right now." Hi, you've reached Wrinkles the Clown. Leave me a message and I'll call ya back. No, Daddy. - Hello, Wrinkles? - No. No! I'm... Let me call you back. I'mma call you back because I think she's trying to act right now. But if she doesn't act right, I'll give you... Hey, Wrinkles, just calling to let you know. Kaila being bad in the store. She's running around and everything. Yeah. Okay. I want you to come get her for a minute or do something 'cause she's being bad. There you go. Hang on. You got it? And I want you to eat her. - Kaila? - Hmm? Can you tell me, um, tell me what Wrinkle... how Wrinkle the Clown sound to you? He was like, "Oh, Kaila", I'm gonna eat you if you'll be bad." Oh, I bring... you want me to bring you to her when I see you? All right. Yeah. 'Cause she's being bad, Wrinkles. Yeah. There you go. Good job. I'm scared of Wrinkles the Clown. He come to my house and scare me at night if I be asleep. Oh, yeah? But what if you're good? - What happens? - He don't come and visit me if I be bad... if I be good. If you're good, he doesn't come to visit? Oh, okay. I don't see that that's child abuse. They're gonna try and push the limit the older that they get and so that's basically just a boundary saying, um, you can go this far, just don't cross that line. They said they're gonna eat me and they said, "no." Oh, okay. I think he did it to actually become some type of contributor to society, giving parents another way to discipline the kid and bring them in line early. "Skype can't connect to your webcam." I don't have a webcam. Hey, Dad, I'm doing the interview right now. I'm doing the interview right now. Yeah, I could see where people would hire Wrinkles, especially if their children are being naughty. I'm not naughty, you're scaring me. I would definitely hire Wrinkles to scare somebody because I'm a terrible person, man. I know where the gun is, okay? And I will... If he shows up to my room at 3:00 a.m... Eadie, you're gonna get me arrested here. He went in the bathroom, he got toilet paper. He was just throwing it all around the house so I called the number. And Wrink... The voicemail picked up again, and when we heard the laugh, he lost his mind. I promise, he lost his mind. He just started crying and he... I promise he didn't move for about, I think, like, two hours. He didn't move for, like, two hours. Okay. Hey, Wrinkles the Clown. Stop. Kaila's being bad. I need you to come get her 'cause she's being bad. - Stop calling him. - Don't be bad then. Hi, Wrinkles, there's this very bad child... Jordan, and I was just wondering if you could give me a call back. You hear this? This is Wrinkles. So misguided. My name is George Holden. I'm a professor and Chair of Psychology at Southern Methodist University and I'm a developmental psychologist. I study parent-child relationships, family violence, parents' use of discipline. This idea of calling Wrinkles the Clown is really misguided. If it's done frequently enough, it's... If it's a pattern of behavior, in this case, we're talking about terrorizing a child, that is... currently accepted as one manifestation of psychological maltreatment, which is a form of child abuse. I found out about Wrinkles the Clown through a news story. To me, it's sad that he couldn't come up with a more positive approach. He doesn't actually have to travel into a home but that threat can still be, at least for kids, as powerful as the real thing. Oh, so you're hyper now, Mrs. Want to, um... play with the ducks. Oh, they running over here. - Here I come with some food! - Throw it in there. I definitely would use Wrinkles one hundred percent of the time over spankings. Spankings, uh... That kind of leaves a mark... you know, and so the phone, um, it's a voice. And it kinda leaves the, um, scary option of, "if I'm bad, then I got to hear this voice," and she doesn't wanna hear the voice. When I was a kid, you got the fucking belt. You know, my dad was old school. He would go hard on you, you know? He cared about us and he didn't want us to get in trouble, so... Now, it's like, you know, you can't hit your kids, you can't do this, you'll go to jail. So, you know, they're using psychological warfare, things like that, you know? They're using what's available. And is that as harmful as spanking your kid with a belt, you know? I don't know. It's up to you, you're the parent. I've been asked before if I feel guilty about the parents that wanna use me for behavioral services. You know, that's a contract between me and mom and dad. That's nobody else's business, so you got a problem with it, you can take it up with mom and dad, 'cause I'm just doing my job. Why are you stalking little kids? Oh, here. I have an idea. Is this good? Um, what I wanna do when I'm older is I wanna be a professional animal trainer. So, this is my dog Schnitzel. He is a schnauzer mix. And then this is my mom's dog, Gracey. Her owners died and no one really knows how, not even, like, police or anything. Okay. So, I just wanted to try to call clowns just to see, like, what would happen and I didn't get in trouble for it but my parents were like, "Why are you calling a clown?" and I was, like, "Well, Wrinkles sounds more real than what I've seen on YouTube." I was like, "Don't be looking up numbers online", don't be calling random people. Don't... You don't even know if this is... Access to this stuff is scary 'cause you don't know what they're getting into. You try to keep an eye on it and try to... But you can't govern all of it and so you just kinda have to hope that you've... you know, that they have a good sense of what's good and not. And yet you got children who otherwise wouldn't even care about clowns except now scary clowns are cool and so he goes clown crazy sometimes. Hey, Wrinkles, I love clowns, I love everything. Clowns inspire me. Um, call me back, leave me a message, text me, anything. I'm making a YouTube video. Bye. If I hired Wrinkles, once my kid fell asleep, I would make him hide under here, and I would like make him bang stuff, like under here, and, like, make him, like, get fr... like, freaked out a little bit. And then.. And then once they fall asleep again, like, I would have him, like, come out like this, and I'd have him go... Like that maybe. And, like... Just, like, try to mess with him even more. And... And then once they fell asleep again, I would have him go like this. I think some people sometimes need to be scared, every once in a while. Just, like, some people, if they're, like, really sad or something, you can just try to scare 'em, and it'll just make 'em like, I guess, a little happier. Like, if I'm home alone watching creepy videos and I get scared, I kinda like it. Like, it'll start feeling real to me like there's something else creepy happening, like, - in the room with me. - And Slenderman! What are you doing? Slenderman! - Okay. Stop. - Slenderman! Slenderman! I just felt something behind me. Okay. Okay. I know that Slenderman is real. I know that he is. Folklore is an outlet for connecting with other people. The superstitions they believe, the legends that they tell. Folklorists, and myself included, find this to be richly evocative of what culture is. Dude. We have to just put rice in it. We have to cut it and then put rice. And put it with the knife. Shit. Okay. Tag you're it, tag you're it, tag you're it. Diablo, you're it. Diablo, you're it. Go! Go, go, go, go! One of the things that happens with legends is we try to verify that they're real or not. Charlie, Charlie, can we play? Charlie, Charlie can we... Online, we see that kids are propelling the transmission of folklore in a very, very rapid succession, in ways that were not previously done before. Devil. Devil. Devil. Devil. - Devil. - Play it again. Folklore provides an opportunity for us to perform and test out ideas to experiment with something - that is scary... - I'm so scared. What if we go missing and they play this on the news - the next day? - And play with that to test the boundaries of safety. Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary. - Bloody Mary. - Bloody Mary. - Bloody Mary. - Bloody Mary. Hi, you've reached Wrinkles the Clown, but I'm not here to take your call. Leave me a message and I'll call ya back. I'm getting the fuck out of here. - Um... - No! Ooh, try it again, try it again. Hi, you've reached Wrinkles the Clown, but I'm not here to take your call. Did you hear that? That was creepy. Now that's Wrinkles the Clown. Should we show them the phone number? Wait. Everyone, be quiet. - 4-0-7... - 7-3-4... 0-2-5-4. Call that number. Now. I'm going to call Wrinkles. He's gonna eat us. What makes Wrinkles the Clown significant as an example of digital folklore is how people have responded to his phone number, uh, and have made kind of a ritual out of calling him. And videos documenting the proof of actually contacting Wrinkles is part of the performance. It's a part of the ritual. Hi, you've reached Wrinkles the Clown, but I'm not here to take your call. Leave me a message and I'll call ya back. - What the heck? - Dude, that's scary. Yeah. I told you. I told you. - Bye, Mr. Wrinkle. - It went straight to voicemail. - Oh. Well, he's there at least. - Wait. Wait, wait. Hi, you've reached Wrinkles the Clown, but I'm not... He... He put it to voice... He just turned off the phone completely. Oh, yeah. Let me go in here and turn off the TV. This is where I do all my videos. I should have just gone in here. For fun, I like to watch videos and make videos on my YouTube channel. What I like about YouTube is you can be creative and you can do what you want and not have to do what anybody else wants. Me and my sister were watching YouTube videos, and we came across Wrinkles the Clown. And so we started doing research on him and then we just called him for a video. We're like, "What if he answers?" And what if he's gonna be real creepy? What if he's gonna start threatening us? "What if he just can't take getting called like that?" And we're sitting there, like, "We shouldn't have done this." It feels like a horror movie when you see someone... something's about to happen. After I saw the video, I felt paranoid. And I had a nightmare, and like, there was clowns in my house, and, like, you couldn't see them, but you could see a shadow of them walk by and it was, like, very creepy. And it made me, like, very scared. I took out my box spring. I slept just on the floor on my mattress and everything. I didn't want anything underneath my bed because I just don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night and there be a clown sitting there, and I don't wanna... start screaming. We ordered boxes and I put it in my closet just so nothing could get in my closet, nothing could be under my bed. I just felt more safe. And locked my windows. It kinda sucks to not be able to feel safe at your own house. Hello, Wrinkles. I need you to come to my house and kidnap a little girl. What did we do to deserve this? Scaring kids, scaring people... I don't know what kind of parents would do that. No parent I know. Talcum powder, put it in a sock to set... 'cause you wanna be matte, you don't wanna be shiny. Real clowning is putting on greasepaint makeup... putting the money into the costumes, into your craft, having the right kind of heart, and your goal is to make people smile. Make people laugh. That's a lot harder than scaring people. Now, a circus clown likes to have a full half hour for putting it on his face. The sort of default clown that most Americans are familiar with is the happy clown. And this is because of, like, Bozo the Clown. The Happy Birthday Clown. We love the trickster figure. We love the figure that makes us think and makes us laugh and maybe embarrasses us. These clowns are trying out a new act. Historically, clowns operated in silence. And part of that goes back to their nature and their role in the circus. They're exaggerated. They're over the top. They're hyper human. They can do these weird, bizarre seemingly supernatural things. We know that there's a human underneath the greasepaint and the wig and whatever else, and yet, there's something unnatural about them, something inhuman. On one hand, they're presenting themselves to the public as happy and goofy. On the other hand, of course, we know that that's an act. You don't know their identity, you don't know what their intentions are, you don't know what they're gonna do and that creeps people out. When you add in the access to children, that just amps it up. Did you like that? Oh, heart is just going wild. I do have a fear of clowns. I do have coulrophobia which is the fear of clowns. Their face is painted and it's scary, like, what are you gonna do? You remember when I dressed up as a clown to scare you? - No. - Well, I do. And you screamed and fell backwards, and laid there. It's a mistake to ask "When did clowns go bad?" because the evil side has always been there. One of the most famous evil clowns historically is Mr. Punch, the star of The Punch and Judy shows, which have been popular in England for centuries. These two puppets are just nasty, and abusive, and vile, and homicidal. And it's a kid show. And kids love it! So when you see these evil clowns come out in culture, in pop culture, in movies, and films, and things like that, it's really hearkening back to a more genuine part of the clown. You can call me... Joker. No! Man down! And when you're down here with me, you'll float too. You'll float, too! Today, I just came from face painting at a party, and like six of the boys wanted to be Pennywise. There's a whole generation growing up with no positive image of a clown whatsoever. I go to a party, I make people laugh and I make cool stuff like this. And get bunch of kids walking around with these. 3-D! Cool. Slap on a mask, you have this empowerment to make people react to you, you know? And that's a powerful thing. You know. But that's what terrorism is. Real clowns are not scary. John Gacy, a man who liked to put on a clown suit and entertain children. Now, he is charged with one murder... and the police have found, at last count, 27 bodies buried under his house and garage and two more in a nearby river. In the 1980s, soon after John Wayne Gacy, rumors and stories circulated that there were clowns, often groups of them in white vans, that were circling around trying to abduct kids. And it spread. In each case you had these rumors in the school districts, in the communities often shared in the news media and by parents who would call, panicked. A van of clowns trying to abduct kids? Of course you're gonna freak out. Who wouldn't freak out? I started off Wrinkles The Clown just as, you know, something to keep me occupied as, you know, retired and whatnot. You know, I did the face makeup and everything, but after a while, especially living down here, the face makeup, it just melts off. You know, no one was hiring me when I was just a regular clown. I just thought, yeah, you know, maybe I'll give it a little edge. Something different. All these clowns are the same, it's kind of boring. Saw this one mask on eBay and... I don't know, I just liked the way it looked. Looked, uh... It was somewhere between, like, Michael Myers and my grandfather. And I was like, "Hey, that's pretty funny." It's kind of creepy, it's kinda got everything I need." So I gave it a try. I'm outside. I had to come tell my mama that it powered off. I'm a comedian and I can make people laugh very easily. I can do a funny face. When I was eight years old, I first heard about Wrinkles and I was, like, very freaked out. I was kind of scared that he would come to my house or something. Wrinkles. What you want, bruh? Do you wanna fight? Come over to Georgia, okay? - Mom? - Yeah? And I'm not telling you my address so you might as well find my address. I have a mama... that's crippled... but I can still fight back. I have a dog that's named Halo. Where is she? Rena, hang the phone up. Don't you make me drop you. Fiona, can I borrow some of your cat food? Okay. Good girl. What you gonna do? 'Cause who cares about you? You need to be in jail right now. Say something. Quit messing with these children. Stop. I'm about to come up there and whoop your ass right now. I'm sorry. Because who cares about you? I care about God and you care about the devil or something? Yes, he does. - I said the "A" word. - You can say I am, - but I'm not... - Well, I had no idea that she was talking to actual Wrinkles, you know. I wasn't talking to him. I left a voicemail. Yeah. I'm scared about another cuss word or something. Well, they've already heard it. That's just crazy. It's funny. But, uh... Yeah, at that time, I remember last year. Clowns are meant to be, you know, funny, uh, running around the rodeos, and acting a fool, and at birthday parties. Honk, honk, honk, honk. - Honk. - Not out trying to hurt people. Scaring children. They could grow up... being traumatized by something like that. Not only liking clowns, but just - not trusting people and stuff. - I need to grab me something. I just had a nightmare last night. Hello. My dad got... killed by Wrinkles and he, like, locked him up in a basement or something. If I would have found him, I'm for real... I'll see how he likes it in the basement. Hi, baby. I've been trying to get her to lay on her back. There she goes. She was laying on her back. I also think Wrinkles wants to have fun... but it's not working... because he's killing kids. He took a little kid home and killed him... and probably made artwork with blood all over the wall. No. I'm here. Well, Florida's just basically a fucking giant swamp with houses, you know, like, just strung about, a lot of shopping, a lot of, uh... a lot of stores that nobody needs. Yeah, it's beautiful, don't get me wrong, but it's just, you know, I'm not doing the golf and, you know, going to the country club and things like that, you know. I just... that's just... I never really fit into that kind of lifestyle. Yeah. I don't really do the strip club as much as I'd like to. Costs a lot of money, you know. It gets harder and harder as you get older. Then you start getting lonely, you know, sometimes I dream about maybe having a girl to settle down with, you know? What am I gonna do? Have them come back to the van? I just wanna go out there and have some fun, and, you know, I'll do something different. Sometimes I go home and I feel good about it. It's kind of rewarding in a way, you know, and it kinda makes it worth all the bullshit. But sometimes I can just close my eyes in the mask and just get in my own head. She's got her excited 'cause she doesn't know. - Yeah. - You won. That's good. - I know. - That's... - Guys? - No. You won - the money. - What's outside? - What? - Huh? There's something outside. Huh? I swear there's something outside. - What the fuck? - What? Oh, my God. Oh, God, God. - Stop! Do something. - Oh, my God! Stop, stop, stop! Wait. I'd probably have a heart attack over that. Yeah. That would scare me to death. He was sitting on the table, one evening, right after supper, and started calling him. You know, I was afraid he was gonna give him information and him come here, and, you know, you hear all those bad stories and... It was scary at first. Remember when I had to take out my box spring... - Mm-hmm. - Because I got real creeped out when I saw the video of him coming out. - Mm-hmm. - So we put it under your bed. If he's under your bed, you can protect yourself. Yeah. The reason I'm not scared of Wrinkles anymore is just I learned how to, like, be okay with it. It's like I basically got scared so much, I'm not scared anymore. So basically today I'm gonna be showing you the clown mask and the little knife that I bought with it. This is the mask. It's gonna be my Halloween costume for next year. Daddy, how do you do this? - Oh, I know how to do it. - Oh, yeah? I wanna do it. - It's so tight. - Well... yeah, it is. I see your eyes bulging through the holes. Oh, yeah. Beautiful. Before he got this mask... It's like he turns into somebody else - when this thing's on. - I know. I think that when someone puts on a mask or a costume, they feel like they can kind of just be a different person. If there's something you wanna change about yourself, you kinda can. Like if there's someone, like, in my school walking around, they wouldn't know me. I could just act like a completely different person and they wouldn't know at all. It's hot in there. I drank a lot of it that night. The viral video shows Robby Stratton running through a convenience store with an alligator in his hands. He takes the animal in the beer fridge as well. I don't even remember coming up here. We asked Stratton where the alligator came from. No clue. No clue. I literally came... This Florida man is accused of having sex with a miniature horse on multiple occasions. He's now being held in the Marion County Jail. I don't know what's next for me. I live day by day. This is kind of where I'm at, this is what I got, this what I'm working with. Um... I don't know. I'm just kind of, uh... I'm just kind of living out my last years. I don't know if there'll be a Wrinkles legacy, so to speak. I think it'll just be like, "Hey, remember that one time we called that clown? That was scary." Yeah, Wrinkles the Clown. Sup yo, watcha you doin? Who's this? Who this? It's your mom. Oh, that's good one. I haven't heard that one yet today. Hey, Wrinkles the Clown. Yeah? You have to scare somebody? Yeah. That's what I do. It never ends. You got the pranks, you know, but mostly it's just real violent stuff. Hey I'll come down to fucking Florida and beat your old wrinkly ass. We live in a big pasture, and my dad has guns to shoot the coyotes but he'll shoot you instead. I will piss on you right now. I'll fucking rip your dick off and fucking make you eat it. I'll slap you with a fucking jackhammer. Fucking Mexican Mafia coming for your ass. We'll cut out your tongue, bitch. And I'll stick needles in your eyeballs and tie you to a fucking tree. And fucking chop off your fingers and fucking... just fucking torture you, you fucking sick bastard. I'mma fucking hang you u like fucking Vladimir Putin. I'll take this fucking baseball bat and beat your fucking brains in. I'mma burn your clown ass. Kill yourself, Wrinkles the fucking clown. If Wrinkles came to my house, I'll tell him, "I have a game for you. We'll just stay shoulder "to shoulder," and then push you in the water with the alligators. It's kinda disheartening to hear and it's... But at the same time, I just... You know, it doesn't really have an effect on me anymore. It's like you know, I'm still kicking. No one's come to try to kill me yet. You know, sometimes these kids text me and like... the more I text back, the more they're trying to call and find out more information or... they wanna prove to their friends I'm real. They're always asking me, "Send me a picture of yourself. Send me a video. You're fake. You're not real. Send me a..." You know? It doesn't really matter who's behind the mask, you know? Like, it doesn't matter who Wrinkles is. Wrinkles is Wrinkles. Who are you? Where did you come from? - How is your life? - I wanna know who you are. Who are you, and why are you doing this? - Who are you? - Who are you? Who are you, and can you tell me your real name please? You're just this weird old man probably. Why do you have to wear a mask? You don't know if he's a good person or if he has bad intentions. You don't know if he's trying to do this for fun or trying kill you. Who are you under that mask? Who are you under that mask? Can you let me see under that mask? Can I get who... who are you? When he's a clown, he could live in the middle of a shack. Whenever he's a regular person, he could be living in a big, old house in the middle of town in Florida. My friends have said that he's been working like this - for over, like, 65 years. - It's also funny to imagine that he refuses to drive or take cars. He just walks around everywhere. You can call him. He will scare people for you, and he's pretty scary himself. And it's sort of like a Bogeyman-man type, uh, type situation, except actually existent. He probably, on Halloween, he's like very scary, but on New Year's, he's, like, very happy because it's a new year to scare kids. There's two people in his body. Multiple personality. It's like bipolar disorder or something. You could be sitting beside a murderer and not even knowing it. - Jamie! - Jamie! - Jamie! - Jamie! - Jamie! - Jamie! - Jamie! - Jamie! Jamie! - Yeah? - All right. How am I gonna know when I'm not in frame, or are you guys gonna be able to cut that or if you... That's all... yeah, it's all mic check... - Don't worry about it all. - Okay. All right. - Mic will move around it. - Roger. - We good? - Yes. Action. I'm Wrinkles the Clown. I'm not a 65 year old man. - Ready. - Action. You know, the actor that was chosen to represent the myth of Wrinkles under the mask, I think he was a perfect match. I think he embodies what Wrinkles would look like. He has wrinkles on all the right spots. He has the gray hair. You know, is this guy nice? Is this guy gonna murder me? And that's kind of how Wrinkles is, you don't know. There's a number of reasons why I think it's a good idea for me to keep my identity hidden. I don't wanna make this project about me. If people knew who was under the mask, it would kind of ruin the experience. Besides the fact of just trying to preserve the mystery of the Wrinkles character. Wrinkles gets multiple death threats a day, and that's fine for Wrinkles, that's fine for the project. But I just don't need that in my personal life. At the end of the day, Wrinkles is just a guy in a mask and a suit, and these kids and these people have taken the Wrinkles character and molded it into what they want it to be. Some of them think he's funny. Some of them think he's rude. Some of them think he's scary. Some of them think he's fake. Some of them think he's a ghost or some kind of paranormal, like, apparition, and really left it open to let people decide on their own what they think about Wrinkles. I, never in a million years, thought that anybody would think that Wrinkles is a real person. Let alone that he scares children for money. You know, I made it up. But I think parents that use the Wrinkles' voicemail as an actual disciplinary tactic to keep their children in line is kind of messed up. I mean, it's not something that I would do as a parent. Um, I think it's kind of psychologically damaging. Hey, I have these two to three kids - that don't know how to listen. - No. We'd give you the price of 30 bucks to come scare them. No. You know, it's not too far off from what is kind of already socially acceptable with telling their kids that if you're not a good person, or if you lie, if you cheat, you steal, you know, you're going to burn in hell for eternity. You know, I think it's more cruel and unusual than anything that Wrinkles has ever done or has ever claimed to do. I was always just very curious as a child, and just very imaginative. Okay. And you put this Wrinkles mask on. Not on me. The clown under the bed is just such a go-to for anyone to think of because of how iconic it is going back to the Poltergeist clown under the bed kinda thing. I remember, as a kid, getting a head start and running into my bed because I was afraid something was gonna come out from underneath and grab my ankles and pull me under, and that will be the end of me. It is a classic kind of fear. I tried getting in the trundle bed, and I was... I was too big. We couldn't close the drawer, which we all kind of got a chuckle out of, you know. So a friend who's a little slimmer than I am, said, "Hey, you know what, I could fit." "Oh All right. Well, here. Put the costume on. And I'll get behind the camera and let's make this video." All right. Is everyone ready? - Yup. - All right. Action. Action 2. This video has a couple elements to make it look more like a security camera. With these effects, you can obscure things more. And I felt like that really helped make the video more believable. Stop for a second. Okay. Doing good. This time you're not gonna, like, do... Just gonna kinda look at her. You're not gonna do anything, though. You don't wanna do anything too creepy. Maybe put a doll next to her or something. Mm-hmm. Get out. Start looking around. All right, stop. What if we just had him grab the camera, disable it, and then you get to use your imagination of what happened after that. It leaves it open. And so it makes it create a story. A story that you're going to continue. We always make a lot of jokes about living here in Naples, Florida. You know, people just come here to die, and if you're 70 and up, and you wanna play golf, and you wanna be in competitions with your neighbor on whose house looks nicer and who drives a better car, then, yeah, Naples, Florida is a great place to live. So I kind of love that Wrinkles... looked older, and he kind of looked a little creepy. And he kind of reminded me of my grandfather who was retired, always grumpy, but hilarious and always had the best jokes. For the most part, I've always been kind of quiet and kind of shy. And I've never been in performing arts, and to all of a sudden turn on a switch and just be a personality that wasn't myself that was kind of funny but kind of rude and just kind of annoyed by children. I felt like it was one of the biggest rushes of my life. Yeah. Wrinkles the Clown. Hello. Yeah. What do you want? We're gonna get a lot of that. They can't believe that someone answered and just kinda hang up. Yeah, Wrinkles the Clown. Hi, Wrinkles. Hey, how is it going, guys? I love your voicemail. It's so cool. Oh, yeah. That's nice. Thank you. Dude, that voicemail sounds just like that. Well, that's my voice so that would make sense, right? - Wrinkles. - Yeah. Do you have a YouTube channel? No. I don't use the internet. - Why? - I don't know. 'Cause I don't like the internet. It's too hard. Are you a killer clown? No. I never killed nobody. You're... Everybody confirmed that you're bad but I don't believe them. No... yeah. You know, a lot of people think - a lot of different things. - You're so nice. You caught me on a good day. - Okay, Wrinkles. - All right. - You kids be good. - Bye. - Bye. - Nice to meet you. Nice meeting you too. I feel like five years ago, I was so much more naive than I am now because I was actually really able to prove a lot of things to myself. You know, I put a picture, a name, and a phone number on a sticker, and... people just did whatever they wanted with it. People of course are taking pictures of it, putting it online. After seeing that, hey, you know what, I'm gonna start bolstering this online presence as well. So I created the HvUseen Wrinkles website and YouTube channel. And that's when I started, like, putting a lot more pictures and, you know, quote, unquote "Wrinkles sightings". I'm trying to think if the video or the sticker came first. I think the video came first. So after that, it became kind of fun to make Wrinkles videos. The second one was Wrinkles walking through a parking lot with a shopping cart full of junk as if he was homeless. And the next video is on US 41. I think we actually shot that video on the same night. Hey. Huh? NBC2 local news was really what kick-started everything. It is a thing of nightmares. Have you seen this clown? Meet Southwest Florida's Wrinkles the Clown. People pay me to go scare their friends. People pay me to go dance at their parties. You know, that kind of things. Bar Mitzvahs and whatnots. All that content was already in place. So it was just so easy for them to put 'em together and make this, like, fantastic story. An internet hit. A Google Plus account is dedicated to his sightings. That created an opportunity for people to say, "Why is this man dressing up as a clown?" What is he doing? Why does he keep doing it?" Oh, my God. Once it hit The Washington Post, then it just kind of snowballed after that. It's actually the first clown ever that can't get other clowns to squeeze into a car with him. They're like, "No. You know, you're a little bit too creepy." We're gonna walk." The man inside the mask is a 65-year-old Rhode Island transplant who got sick of making balloon animals and has moved more towards a menacing "See this balloon", kid? It's your head" before popping it kind of a clown. Like happy birthday, Suzie. Well, we got you a gift that will haunt you forever. Watching Jimmy Fallon make fun of Wrinkles, I'm like, "Oh, my God. I can't believe that this" actually went as far as it did. I think a lot of people started recognizing that whoever this Wrinkles the Clown is, he's getting a lot of attention, and I'd like to get some of that attention too and I'm gonna dress up like a clown and go in the woods and scare my friends. Disturbing report out of Greenville, South Carolina in a neighborhood there. People living there say a clown is trying to lure children into the woods. Right there at that tree back there. They say he uses money and candy to get children's attention. I thought my child was, you know, seeing things. The next day I had about 30 kids come up to me and say, "Did you see the clowns in the woods?" I'm over here to make sure we get a full understanding of what is law enforcement doing because we have around two to three hundred children out here. We were working some overtime squads to patrol in areas where we thought that we would see a potential clown sighting. What was different about this situation was the viral nature of the social media. - Clowns in the... - Clown sightings... Clowns terrorizing a town in South Carolina. Greenville County 911. What is the location of your emergency? I am reporting the, um... the silver clown. You're reporting what? The news about the clown that's, like, reportedly going around our neighborhood and kidnapping children, raping 'em, and killing 'em. Are you just calling to tell me this is in the news or do you see him out there? I've seen him out here. I felt the fear would overtake us. I'm begging you. Whoever you are, clowns, get away. The latest clown sighting happened Tuesday night at. Shemwood Crossing Apartments. All we see is these men jumping over the fence, you know, looking at the kids, and then they take off running so we all run back here and chasing them and stuff. We've seen 'em busting through a wood right here, pulling the wood, and then they ran through. I could see if my kid get snatched up by one of them. You know what I mean, but he's just... It's crazy, all right. It's real. It was kind of scary to see where it was going because I didn't know if like, "Oh, shit." Did we have anything to do with this?" Before you know it, you have this creepy clown phenomenon. Since then, sightings keep increasing. Those creepy clowns are making headlines from coast to coast. Flomaton, Montgomery, Moundville, Brighton, Irondale, Rainbow City, Anniston. It's happening everywhere. It started in South Carolina. - Now it's up here. - I'm just freaking out 'cause I'm going all over Instagram and all I see is, "Oh, clowns, clowns, clowns," you know? Nobody knows how to defend against it because we don't know if it's a prank or if they're really trying to harm people. Now, kids are carrying around machetes with clown masks on and things like that. Police Chief Kenny Hampton said he saw a clown carrying a machete. He's subject to get shot. A clown attacked you here tonight and cut you with a knife? - Yeah. - How scared were you? I was, like, a lot scared. He used his selfie stick to hit the clown who then disappeared into the woods. Sir, I was not scaring. I promise you. I was not scaring nobody. I'm a kid, and I'm afraid that... that the clowns are gonna kidnap me. You can't be too cautious when it comes to kids. You can definitely... Especially with shootings, you know, and this weird clown thing. God forbid a kid ever shows up with a bomb or with a machete in a clown suit and starts hacking people up at a school or anything like that. And, especially, if they ever blamed it on Wrinkles, that would make me feel terrible. - I am a nervous wreck. - The fact that there was a threat of a shooting at the school, and not just one of the schools, it was all three of them. The most serious incident so far though, has been the death of a 16-year-old in Reading, Pennsylvania. It's extremely alarming about what's going on right now in the United States. What the fuck is happening? - I don't know. - After rumors spread on the Penn State Campus, Tuesday morning, that clowns were spotted nearby, over 500 students took to the streets to find them. Fuck that clown! Fuck that clown! Fuck that clown! Fuck that clown! Fuck that clown! I definitely took a step back, but once I saw the power of throwing an idea out and having people grab onto that idea and react to it, I figured, "Here's an opportunity" "to really learn some things." You know, I would put my phone down and walk away for an hour and come back, and there would be, like, thousands of notifications, and my phone was dying 'cause it just couldn't keep up with all of the text messages and voicemails. They were calling with their concerns. They were calling with their hatred. They were calling with their absolute acceptance. What does this tell us about different people and how they process information, how they view it on the media, how they view it on social media, or just the ideas that they made up in their head just seeing a sticker in a light pole, you know. What did their imagination dream up? This one is one of my top favorites. It says "Would you rather die or die." And I thought that would just be kind of funny and creepy at the same time. So the top of his head. Just... Kinda like this. You're trying to make it not look perfect. The end goal is to make yourself look like a clown. I put on clown makeup to scare people. Then you're just gonna put in on your nose. I need red lipstick. I'll be right back. Once I found out about Wrinkles, you know, I started having other ideas for clown videos. So we got makeup and then we just basically wanted close stuff and, like, running and, like, trying to scare. I feel like my videos are a reflection of my personality. Like, I don't try to act goofy. I just like to make videos that, like, make me happy, make me laugh. Found some. - The crazy lady is back. - The way it started out, she would just try to put on makeup 'cause everybody else was putting on makeup. But, uh... she would make herself look like a clown. I'm like, "You are not going to town with me" "looking like a clown." You're just gonna take it a lot. When I upload all my new videos, I'm excited. You know, I'm happy that, like, I've got a video done, and that I've edited it. I feel like somewhat like I've accomplished something. I do have a goal to become a filmmaker one day. What's your favorite food? Uh, cats. I always had the mind of him playing football. I had people coming up to me all the time, "He could play for the Cowboys when he gets older." "The doctor says he's gonna be 6'5" when he's older. And... that's just not him. This is him. This is what he likes to do. You need to make a big dot on your face. Now, I'm Wrinkles. And now I'll do this too. Have you talked to this neighbor already - or... - No. They... - I don't really know them. - Okay. Yeah. I mean, this kind of is a perfect spot. There's little bit of cover and it gives a little, um... you know, a little mystery. And it might make them - look a little bit harder. - Sure. Sure. So the family would be playing cards here. Sitting here, having one or two kids just right there. Maybe you're like... you're filming and you kind of zoom in, you know. You just zoom in a little bit, and you're like, "Oh, my God." What the fuck is that," you know? Like, "Holy shit." The less you say, the better. Let them be the ones that react, but you'll still be recording, but you're gonna be running as well. They'll see floor, ceiling, floor, ceiling, floor, ceiling. - With the camera? - With the camera. And maybe you drop the phone in the hallway, and you, you know, you let... Then we're gonna pick up all the audio - of the genuine reaction. - Oh, how great would it be... - Screaming. - If she drops it. Yeah. Then I could come in... Wrinkles could come in, see the phone, bend down, pick it up, end of video. Do you wanna get some pizza later on? That's gonna be the code. Do you guys wanna go get pizza? - Yeah. - You wanna get something? That's when you know that he's here. He just texted here. When my timer goes off on my phone, then I know I'm gonna start doing the peek around. The peek around. Did anyone see that? What's outside? I swear there's something outside. What the fuck? I'll come in. I'll grab the phone. I'll hit stop. Jesus Christ. And then after that happens, - I'm booking it. - Yeah. I'm out of here. You guys heard those screams, right? - Yes. - Holy fucking shit. One girl came back to see if, like... Everyone else had ran. I don't know who it was, but the one that came back, I think she saw me, like, on the porch and she fucking lost her mind. Holy shit. There's fucking cops all over this neighborhood. I think on this one, I'm gonna cut it off. Let's see. I kinda love the abruptness of that. You know, with that, it kind of leaves more to the imagination. Like, "What the hell?" What happened after that? What... You know, did Wrinkles get 'em? Did they get away? "Did they call the cops? Did they..." you know, whatever. I don't think anything I do after the Wrinkles project is going to have as big of an impact. But sometimes you surprise yourself. Maybe this is just a gateway into something bigger. - Yeah. - You wanna get something? The fuck is that? I think there is an element of internet troll to Wrinkles. He's provocative, right? He's trying to get a reaction out of you. Maybe it's screaming with laughter, maybe it's terror, maybe it's calling his phone number. Who knows? By calling him, you're essentially inviting him in into your life. Testing those boundaries is a part of growing up. I'm gonna be calling a killer clown. Apparently, his name is Wrinkles. Uh, I got this number a hundred percent real off the Internet. I think people just wanna see what would happen if they call the clown. Like... maybe he would come to their house or something. They just wanna see what could happen. Oh, dang. I think the creepiest part is when he grabs the camera and, like, it just goes out. Like... I think if the girl woke up, it would be complete madness and, like, she would start screaming bloody murder. He don't have any eyeballs. How does he see? I do parties, children behavioral services, the whole shebang, you know, give me a call. Are you the real one that gets hired to scare the shit out of kids? Yeah. Wrinkles the Clown. - You heard of me? - Yeah. You know, maybe the negative parts of Wrinkles will die off and maybe the fun parts - of Wrinkles will live on. - Oh, my God. - His name is Wrinkles. - Sweet dreams. As many people that hate Wrinkles and hope he dies a slow, horrible death, there's a lot of people out there that love Wrinkles and they love the character and they like the funny parts about him and they like the cynical parts that they can relate to. I love you, Wrinkles, so much. I think you're the number one clown. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. You're my role model. I can laugh like you, listen. - Wrinkles! - What're you doing? - What're you doing? - High five, again. - High five? - High five again. - Please. - High five. Thank you. Oh, my God. You're so cute. Oh, God. I can't see. There's too many high fives going on here. - One, two, three. Wrinkles. - Wrinkles. Our individual minds are such humongous places. And the places that you can go, it can be some of the darkest, deepest depths of just awful terribleness to some of the most enlightening most beautiful places. It's just interesting to see where people decide to go in their mind because, at the end of the day, they're the ones that are taking this very small information they know about Wrinkles The Clown, and decided which way to take it. I saw your YouTube video. I don't have a YouTube video. - What are you talking about? - Yeah, right. - Come on. - All right. All right. Last picture of the night. Wrinkles got to go to the bathroom. Come on. What?
