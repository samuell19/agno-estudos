What the fuck, Caleb? Oh, wait till you see the shot I got. You looked like you were gonna shit a brick out sideways. You could have taken my head off. It wouldn't have been a clean decapitation with these blades. You'd just scramble your face up real good. Shouldn't you go see if Jessica is feeling any better? She'll be fine. I gave her Klonopin so she can sleep off whatever the fuck is wrong with her. Girl is such a pain in the ass. Jessica? Hey. How you feeling, cuz? Since none of these other friends of yours bothered to show up, can I take your car and escape the hell of being stuck here with your latest boyfriend? Great chat. You better wake up in the next half hour or I'm gonna be forced to go drown that brainless meat puppet's sorry ass. "The intense horror of my nightmare came over me." "I tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung on and a most melancholy voice sobbed, 'Let me in.'" "'Let me in!'" "As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely a child's face looking through the window." "Finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off, I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane..." Jess? - "...and rubbed it to and fro..." - Please shut up. "...till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes." "Yet still it wailed, 'Let me in!'" Jessica! Shit, shit, shit! Shit, shit, shit! No, Jess. Jess? Jess? Who's the brainless meat puppet now? Caleb. What the fuck? Oh, my God. What the hell happened? Jess? Jessica? What the fuck? What? No, no, no... Caleb! No... No, Caleb! Caleb! Beth! Beth, you in there? Just give me five, all right? Brandon is losing his shit. He can't find the St rat he won in that arm wrestling contest last night. It's already tuned and racked stage left like I told you it was half an hour ago. You feeling all right in there? I'm fine. Just go man your station. I'll be back before curtains up. You got it, boss. Have you seen my favorite black t-shirt? I need it for the Labor Day protest tomorrow. Mom? You're not going to any protest on your own. Sophie's dad's taking us. I've told you, like, ten times already. Remember? Well, did you remember to check the bathroom hamper? Tell Danny to turn the music down. Mom says, "Turn the music down!" I could've done that myself! Kassie, you better not have my scissors. Don't got 'em, Mom! It's dirty. Well, stick it in the laundry, and I'll do it later. You'll forget. You always forget. You know where the washing machine is. Hey, Bridget. Mom's on nights and we're watching all the Freddy movies in a row. - Even the shitty ones. - There aren't any shitty ones. So, you, um, wanna come over and... In your dreams. Your boyfriends are weirdos. You're the weirdo. Kassie! Big crowd in tonight, Dan? - Get out, Bridge! - I would, but... Let me in! Somebody get that, please! All right, all right! Boo! Beth. You bitch. Surprise, sis. When did you get into town? I Uber'd straight here from LAX. Hmm. You been sleeping? You look like Mom. Beats looking like a tampon. You know, the downstairs buzzer is totally busted. I was able to walk in right off the street. Whole building's busted. It's getting knocked in a month. You're kidding me. Nope. We're out. Have you guys found a new place? Not yet. Shit, El. You and Jay have been here forever. Was Bangkok awesome? Insane. Crazy, obsessive fans over there. Did you drink snake blood? Hey, that's culturally insensitive. What about monkey brain barbecue? Oh, yeah. That's so much better, Dan. Who's your friend, Kass? She's called Staffanie. Oh. Hey, Staffanie. What's her, uh, situation? Danny told me that when this building used to be a bank, a teller got caught stealing and hunged himself and if you walk around with coins in your pockets, his ghost hears the jingle. And he scares you to death so he can take all your money. It's true. If he comes after me, Staffanie will scare him to death first. Ghosts aren't real. - Have you ever seen one? - Mmm-mmm. Then how do you know they don't exist? Because... I only believe what I can see. For me? It's for badass rock chicks only. Look, Mom. I'm a badass. Please don't indoctrinate her into your groupie world. What's a groupie? Your mom's favorite nickname for me, even though she knows I'm a guitar technician. If you say so. Hey, be nice or you don't get a gift. Speaking of which, check out what I got your dad. What's going on, El? Danny, go take my car and get pizza with your sisters. Sure thing, Mom. I just can't wrap my head around all this. What, did he meet someone else? No. He believes paying child support equals co-parenting from afar. Why didn't you tell me, El? I would've jumped right on a plane to help you work through this. I called you. Twice. First time, when he told me he was leaving. Second, the night he moved out. That was two and half months ago, Beth. I'm sorry, okay? You know when I'm on the road, I get sucked in deep and I'm trying to make chief tech right now. And if I do, I'll be the first woman in my crew to do it, so... Please, Ellie, we need to talk this through properly. El... Look, you can sleep on the sofa tonight but I gotta pack and move. Hey, Be thy-boo. It's Ellie. Just... calling to say hi. And, um... me and Jay, we, uh... You know what... I don't blame you. I hate the sound of my voice too. What's going on with you, Beth? I screwed up again, like I always do. And I need you to help me figure it out. Again. What happened? Mmm. Hurry up, Bridge. You wanna carry them? You wanna get your license? Come on, Kass. Earthquake! Come on. Go! Stay down! Shit. That was intense. I think I peed my pants. Is it warm? Mmm-mmm. It's probably just soda. All right. Come on. Holy shit. Bridget, check this out. What is it? There's a hole. Careful, Dan. There could be aftershocks. It's an old bank vault! Danny, don't! Dan? Come on, Danny. Let's go! Just hang on! Danny! Relax a minute, Bridge! Danny, are you okay? I'm fine. Anything? The network is totally screwed. I'm sure they're fine, El. Hey. Is everyone okay? Anybody hurt? Hey, Gabe. The kids went to go get pizza and I can't get through on their cells. Can I borrow your car to go find them? - How about I drive you? - Thanks. Let me get the keys. - Who are you? - Beth. Ellie's sister. Ah, yeah, yeah. The groupie. Let me ask you somethin'. Can you hear her up there? - What? - Quake. Sent her hiding in the ducts. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Let's roll. Is that them? Good to meet you. You never take the elevator after a quake. Bridget dropped the pizza. Oh, honey. I love you guys so much more than pizza. The magnitude 5.5 earthquake hit just north of the Puente Hills fault less than an hour ago. Jolting downtown Los Angeles and everywhere from La Habra to... You think it might be worth something? Mom could do with some extra money right now, don't you think? I don't think Mom wants cash from something you stole. It's not stolen. It's probably been locked in that vault forever. Yeah, and weird shit like this gets locked away for a reason. Just leave it, Dan. Argh! Fuck! Let me see it. It's just a nick. Dan... Danny, please close it. I don't like this, Dan. You need to put it back right now. Mom's not letting any of us out the front door again tonight. First thing in the morning then. Promise me? You going deep sea diving? I gotta see under before I get in. I got stung by a jellyfish at the beach before. I don't like going underwater. I don't think there's any weird sea creatures in the tub. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's a... It's a... You okay? I'm good, sweetie. I hate when my tummy hurts too. Good afternoon, my fellow clergymen. I am Father Marcus Littleton, the library keeper here at Saint Patrick's Cathedral and I welcome you all today to the City of Angels. You've been invited here to witness the unveiling of a unique artifact that was discovered by our overseas missionaries. I would like to present what I believe to be one of the three fabled volumes of Naturum Demon to, The Book of the Dead. My tests to date have revealed that its bindings are made of cured human flesh, its passages and etchings inked in blood. This is heresy! Today, I seek church approval to translate the spiritual mysteries its pages undoubtedly hold. Destroy it! It's called The Book of the Dead for a reason! I seek to look at this book for the good of man! Rejected by the elders of our church, myself, Canon Damien Shanahan, and Father Hugo Cortez have been working in secret to translate The Book of the Dead's myriad writings and glyphs. Its pages contain ancient rituals and incantations, the recitation of which proclaim to allow contact with supernatural forces that exist beyond the thin veneer of our known world. It is January 24th in the year of our Lord, 1923. And I, Father Marcus Littleton, shall now commence reading aloud the first of the spiritual resurrection passages. Hey! Help! Help! Shut the fuck up! It's okay. It's okay. It's just a blackout. Bridget? You all right? Yeah. Looks like it's just us that's out. Really? Mom? El, are you sleeping? Where is she? Mom? El? What's up, sis? I had the most beautiful dream. We were together, sitting in a tall forest. The wind was clean and the birds were singing the sweetest... Melodies. It was a perfect day and all I could think about was how much I wanted to cut you all open and climb inside your bodies so that we could stay one happy family. It's in me. Don't let it take my babies. Mom! Bridget, take her back inside. Now! What's wrong with her, Bridge? Stairs. Go! Go, go, go. Come on. Wake up, Ellie. Come on, wake up. Danny! They're gone. One minute she was fine and the next she was talking crazy and... And now she's gone. Network's still fucked. May I pray? She's not religious. Wasn't. It's just a few words. Join me. Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord and let perpetual light shine upon her. May her soul and the souls of all the faithful departed through the mercy of God... What the hell happened to her face? Rest in peace. Looks like someone beat her up. There's an old fire-escape ladder on the north side of the building. I could try to get down that, raise the alarm, get some help in here. You have to go through 82. Ah, shit. That's unoccupied, right? Yeah. Like most of this condemned dump. You got the tools? We could just cut right through the door. In my truck. You ain't gettin' through those old doors without something heavy-duty. I want Dad to come home. He will. When we get the phones working again, he'll come right back. How do you know he will? You said Mom was gonna be okay. I thought she would be. I'm so sorry, Kass. I'm gonna get my shotgun, and we're gonna blast it open. Just give me a minute, okay? I don't like being trapped. Everyone is on edge enough without guns getting fired in here. I don't know what to do, El. You're the one who always has the answers. I'm too scared to even face your kids right now. No matter how busy you ever got, you always found time for me. For everyone. I can't believe I'm never gonna speak to you again. Hey, Be thy-boo. It's Ellie. Just... calling to say hi. And, uh... Beth. Beth! You have to help me, Beth. You have to. - I'm burning. - I'm burning alive! El? - Mom? - She's alive? She's burning up. I'll get ice. Mom? Mommy's with the maggots now. Mom, stop it! Stop it! It's not my fault, Bridget. Get away from her, Bridge! What's happening to me, sweetheart? I don't know, Mom. I do. I'm free now. Free from all you titty-sucking parasites. Let me kiss it better. Who wants to rot next? Eeny... meeny... miny... You. Ellie? Fuck! Grab the cabinet. Get away from the door. Please, we need help! Let me in! Hello! Can you hear me? Don't you think Mom looks just like one of those pictures from that book? Answer me, Danny. You never should've stolen it. This isn't my fault. This is your fault! - Get off me! Get off! - Stop it! - Hey! Hey, hey! - This is all your fault! Hey. Hey. You don't turn on each other. Ever. I need to show you something. What is this, Danny? Does it hurt bad? Bridget? I'm okay. ♪ Gold-haired girls ♪ ♪ With curling tresses ♪ ♪ Hush-a-bye baby ♪ ♪ Babe not mine ♪ ♪ Mothers who nurse ♪ ♪ With sad caresses ♪ ♪ Hush-a-bye baby ♪ ♪ Babe not mine ♪ Mom? Beth? I took these too. There's this creepy priest on them, reading passages from the book. It's like a weird dark prayer. And when he spoke the words... Bridget's right. This is all my fault. Bridget... Bridget... ♪ And black knife bring ♪ ♪ To cross my sorrow ♪ ♪ Hush-a-bye baby ♪ ♪ Babe not mine ♪ Oh, there you are. Hey there, cutie-pie. What's wrong with you, Mom? I was just feeling sad about me and your dad. But he's here now. He came home to see us. We're getting back together. We love each other. Isn't that right, my darling? And we love you too. Open up and let us in, Kassie. We can be a big, happy family again. You don't look so good, Mom. Oh. Nothing a big old hug and kiss from you won't fix. Open up now, like a good girl. That's it. Come on, now. Do it for Mom and Dad. Mom! - You okay? - I'm sorry. I thought Mom was better. Open the door like you open your legs, you stinking groupie slut! I'm not a groupie, you psycho bitch! Beth. Beth. Go to your room. It'll be okay, Danny. Staffanie will protect us. Right? Yeah. What are you looking at, hon? I gotta kill the creepy-crawlies that I got inside my tummy. I don't like having things inside my tummy. Do you, Auntie Beth? Hey. Is this a nightmare? It's just like a nightmare, Kass. Is what happened to Bridget and Mom gonna happen to us? I'm not gonna let that happen. I promise. You'd be a good mom someday, Auntie Beth. Oh, yeah? Yeah. You know how to lie to kids. I thought I should tie her up. Just in case. I wanna listen to that vinyl. It's too dangerous. Those words... Yeah, well, maybe there's words on there that can help stop all of this. We've got no power to run a turntable. I can fix that. I listened to the first and then he spoke the words on the second. I guess I'll start at the other end, then. Just in case. It is now two nights since I read aloud from the book. My want to understand and commune with the other side could not have been more misguided. I make this final recording as a warning to whoever next comes into contact with its malignant pages. Naturum Demon to cannot be destroyed. When you find it, bury it deep in our secret vault, for the words I uttered have unleashed a demonic entity beyond my darkest nightmare. Is Bridget gonna come back like Mom? I don't know, Kass. The demon possessed Cortez first, rotting him from the inside out. With the might of our Lord's words, we tried to drive out the foul entity but it mocked our prayers and took Shanahan under its control. Fellow priests came to our aid but the possession quickly spread amongst them without rhyme nor reason. This evil is not governed by the rules of man. No, it takes its pleasure in creating terror through total chaos. Desperate to end this curse, I tried to kill what were once my brothers. I led them to the woodshed and set it ablaze. But they danced in its flame and reveled in its burn. Mr. Fonda's kitty hides up there sometimes. I don't think it's a cat. I buried their squirming, spitting corpses in consecrated earth. But they arose again, rotting and rage-filled. Careful, Danny. After hiding in the cellar for a night, I knew only one choice remained. Complete bodily dismemberment. Told you, you should've put the book back, Danny. I chopped, and I hacked, and I... I failed. I can hear them outside the doors now, begging for me. It is only a matter of time before I am taken too. Nothing can stop this demonic force. Even its final remnants will come after you. You must run. All you can do is run! This horror will not stop until innocence is destroyed. Until evil... ...be thy name. Danny. I'm sorry, Kass. I will swallow your soul. Two souls? Please. El... Ellie waits in hell for you and your unborn bastard baby. No. Auntie Beth! Are you hurt? Are you gonna be a mom? Yes. And I'm getting us out of here. How? Fire escape. Let's go. Don't look back there. Get back. Cover your ears. Be thy-boo! She's trying to take your mommy away from you, Kassie. I know you're not my mom anymore. Don't take me from them. You have no idea what it's like to bring a child into this world, Beth. That's my gun, you thieving cunt. Auntie Beth! Auntie Beth! Everybody here dies by dawn, Beth. Run! Dead by dawn! Dead by dawn! - Dead by dawn! - By dawn! Dead by dawn! Dead by dawn! Dead by dawn! Dead by dawn! Dead by dawn! Dead by dawn! Dead by dawn! Here. No way out! No way out! No way out! - Auntie Beth! - Come here! No! Kassie. Kassie. Kassie. Kassie. Kassie. Am I dead? Come on. Get in. Kass, where's the beeper? Come on. Come on. It's coming. Get under! Kassie! All I want is your little head, baby girl. Come get some. Turn it on, Kass! Please. Help me, Be thy-boo. Only my sister gets to call me that. You know, you really do look like Mom. And you're gonna fail miserably just like her. You stinking, horrible... ...groupie cunt! There's been no cell signal until, like, five minutes ago and the thunder kept me awake, so I got basically less than zero sleep. Anyway, all my early morning moans aside, we are still gonna have such a fab weekend at the lake. Caleb's dad's cabin is so awesome, and you're gonna absolutely love his friends. I'm sure one of them will be perfect for you. I don't mean to be a downer or anything but I was actually thinking of taking a rain check on this whole trip thing. Not a chance. I'm picking you up in 15. Bye!
