SWIMMING Sparklers! Sparklers! There's no Christmas without sparklers! - I have this! - I'd love to have this! Christmas trees! Cheap Christmas trees! Who's chasing you? Come here! - Where can I find the office? - Why do you need it? - I'm looking for my father. - Your dad? His name? - Suhajda J?nos Sr. - Suhajda... - Suhajda. Room 578. - Thank you. Here are the papers. Thank you very much. Hello Mr. Sz?sz. You don't remember me? I'm Suhajda J?nos. Look at you, you have grown. - What are you doing here? - I'm looking for my dad. Come with me. Wait here. It's here. - Excuse me, I'm looking for Suhajda J?nos. - Go back there. - Hello Dad. - You? What are you doing here? What do you want? How many times have I told you not to disturb me at the office? - Mom sent me. - I told your mom too. - But the key... - What key? The key. Mom thinks you took it accidentally. You're always disturbing me. I don't have time for stupidities like this. The key. Your mom should know it's not here. Look for it at home. - What are you staring at? - Me? Nothing. - Is this your room? - What do you mean? Of course it is. - Do you like it? - It's nice. I can't find it. And I told you not to go among respectable people. You're dirty. You didn't wash up. And your shoes... Like a vagabond. Aren't you ashamed? - Your son? - Yes. He's useless. Always wandering somewhere. Never studying. What do you want from him? It's Christmas break. Are you failing school, my dear? Duh! There it is! Suhajda! Where's Suhajda? Suhajda! There's something wrong here, Mr. Suhajda. - Take care of it! - Yes, Sir. We shouldn't waste time with this. - Pick up the papers you need. - Right away, Sir. Who is this? - It's Suhajda's son, Sir. - Suhajda? - What's your name? - Suhajda J?nos. - What grade are you in? - 2nd grade in grammar school. - And your grades? - Not very good. But it's only midterm. But I'm failing one subject. - Which one? - Latin. - So you don't know any Latin? - I know some. So, how do you say: "An eagle doesn't catch flies"? Good. And the other subjects? - I'm good at Math. - Good. Keep it up. You might become something. - What do you want to be? - Me? An aviator. - An aviator? - Yes. But don't tell anyone. Here it is. Everything is alright. Ah, so things can be done properly after all. - Yes, Sir. - Thank you. I talked with your son. He's a nice, intelligent kid. He could go far. He's a very good, hard-working kid. Now hurry home, my son. Your mom is waiting. Bye, Jan?ka. The key, Dad. Of course. I'll bring it. Are you crying, little boy? Who hurt you? No one. And you? He doesn't even know what's he crying for. Oh son, where were you? You must be frozen. Give me your hand. Did you find dad? - Yes. - So he was at the office. In room 578. With his back to everyone. Even his desk was so small. And why are you crying? Did he curse at you? Beat you? No. He kissed me and called me Jan?ka. He never called me Jan?ka before. The key. Dinner! Dinner is ready! Dinner! Dinner is ready. Jancsi! How many times do I have to call you? Oh no, my son. Your hands. No no no. Wait for your turn. Your dad comes first. This one! This one doesn't know how to behave. Why are you so mad at him? Because he's bad. He's not bad. He is. He is. He is absolutey useless. He doesn't know his responsibilities. If I worked like this at the office... But what do you know about the office... And he should study! He studied all morning. And you think he learned anything? Of course he did. So, how do you say... So, how do you say... ..."they will praise me"? So you don't even know this. Do you? You don't want to go swimming next week either. You'll fail your exam again. He knows, he just gets confused. I'll take him out of school. He'll learn some trade. He wouldn't be good for that either. He'll never become anything. He won't have an office. He won't have a good job. He sucks at everything that requires a bit of thinking. You'll study hard, right Jancsi? You can't enjoy these damn few weeks because of this brat. At least if he would study. Those who fail at school should study now. GOT IT?! I'm studying. DON'T! DON'T STUDY! It's pointless. No, it's not. You have to study. And you should forgive him. Where are you going? Swimming. Take him with you. Go son, get your swimsuit. - He doesn't deserve it. - Ok ok, of course he doesn't. Go, your dad is waiting for you. Go! I'll join you when I finish here. Here's some corn. - Greetings! Have a nice swim. - Thank you. - Hello Mr. Suhajda. - Hello. Enjoy your meal and have a nice day. Won't you come to the beach? - Hi! - Hello! Come on. Chocolate and vanilla. Hello, Sir. - And you? - Chocolate and vanilla. Hello Mr. Wekerle. Coming from the beach? The water is excellent! How are you doing, young man? What about the weather? The water is great. We should enjoy it while it lasts. You should come visit us with your wife and son. My wife would love it. - Hello, Mrs. Istenes. - Hello. Today is a good day to go swimming. Come on, I'll get you a cabin. It's quiet here at this time. Most people are still eating dinner. But they'll come in the afternoon and the place will be packed. Young man! Come with me, you can change here. Follow me. To the left. There's an empty cabin. Hey, you can come. - Are you afraid? - No. Then what are you waiting for? Come on, come on my friend. - I hope you're not a coward. - Me? No. - One more time? - One more time. Come here, my son. One more time. One more time. One more time. One more time. One more time. One more time. One more time. Where are you? You hear me? Jancsi! Jancsi! Come on! Don't joke with me! Swim champ! Come on! Jancsi! Jancsi! Jancsi! Come on! Are you crazy? You hear me? Jancsi! I told you to stop this. Come on! I told you to stop this. Jancsi! Jancsi! My little son! Jancsi! Where are you? Where... Jancsi! Where are you? Do you hear me? Where are you? I can't find him. Jancsi, where are you? WHERE ARE YOU? Jancsi! People! Someone, help! I can't find him. I can't find him. Help! Help! What happened? Help, people. Someone! Come! Help! What happened to your boy? My god... Oh my God. They'll come later... ...and the place will be packed. The water will be over-crowded. They came so early. It's not even 3 o'clock yet. The end.
