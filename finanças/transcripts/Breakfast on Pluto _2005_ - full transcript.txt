SAINT KITTEN, WHO STRUTTED THE CATWALKS, FACE LIT BY A HALO OF FLASHBULBS AS, "OH!" SHE SHRIEKED, "I TOLD YOU, FROM MY BEST SIDE, DARLINGS." (Patrick) I WAS BORN, YOU SEE, MUNCHKIN, IN A SMALL TOWN NEAR THE IRISH BORDER. I WAS LEFT IN A BASKET ON A CERTAIN DOORSTEP AND ONLY THE ROBINS KNEW WHY.

OH. SO HOW'S PATRICK AND THE BRADEN HOUSEHOLD? THEY'RE WELL, MR. FEELY. ESPECIALLY MY MOTHER, WHEREVER SHE IS. SO SOMEONE'S TOLD YOU SOMETHING, PATRICK? THEY DON'T HAVE TO. HAIRY ARSE BRADEN TELLS ME EVERY DAY. AH, PATRICK, NOW... I'M SORRY, MR. FEELY. YOU KNOW, I SAW HER ONCE, YOUR REAL MOTHER, LONG AFTER THE DAY SHE LEFT. IT WAS IN LONDON. I WAS DOING WORK FOR GENIE MCQUILLAN. I WAS GOING HOME THROUGH PICCADILLY AND THERE, PASSING BY, WAS EILY BERGIN. (Benny) LOVELY AS THE DAY SHE LEFT, I SWEAR IT TO GOD. (Patrick) DID YOU TALK TO HER, MR. FEELY? WHAT DID SHE SAY? I SHOUTED AFTER HER, PATRICK, BUT SHE DIDN'T HEAR. LONDON SWALLOWED HER UP. THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE TOWN. BIGGEST CITY IN THE WORLD... IT SWALLOWED MY MOTHER UP. WHAT ABOUT MY FATHER, MR. FEELY? I WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT, SON. THINGS BE COMPLICATED, YOU KNOW. WHAT DID SHE LOOK LIKE? MITZI GAYNOR, SON. THAT'S WHO SHE LOOKED LIKE, MITZI. MITZI GAYNOR. [gunshots on T.V.] WELL, FUCK ME PINK WITH A HAIRY ARSE! IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE HOLY SPIRIT, AMEN. [whispering] YOU SEE, ONCE UPON A TIME, THERE WAS A YOUNG GIRL NAMED EILY BERGIN WHO LOOKED NOT UNLIKE THE WELL-KNOWN FILM STAR MITZI GAYNOR WHO SANG I'M GONNA WASH THAT MAN RIGHT OUTTA MY HAIR. AND SHE WENT TO LONDON, THE BIGGEST CITY IN THE WORLD, WHICH SWALLOWED HER UP. BUT BEFORE SHE VANISHED, I THINK SHE WORKED AS A PRIEST'S HOUSEKEEPER, FATHER. BUT I COULD BE WRONG THERE, COULDN'T I? I MEAN, I COULD BE WRONG. AFTER ALL, I... ALL I WANTED WAS HER ADDRESS. (Mr. Egan) THERE BETWEEN THE PO AND THE APENNINES, BOYS THE CLIMATE IS ALWAYS THE SAME. THE LANDSCAPE NEVER CHANGES AND IN COUNTRY LIKE THIS YOU CAN STOP ALONG ANY ROAD FOR A MOMENT AND LOOK AT A FARMHOUSE SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF MAIZE AND HEMP, AND IMMEDIATELY A STORY IS BORN. NOW, WHEN YOU'RE WRITING YOUR ESSAY FOR ME THIS MORNING, WHATEVER FORM IT TAKES IS UP TO YOU. IT CAN BE CALLED "I FOUGHT IN THE EASTER RISING," "I WAS DRACULA'S GIRLFRIEND," OR EVEN "A DAY IN THE LIFE OF AN OLD BOOT". YOU'VE GOT ONE HOUR, SO LEARN TO WRITE. "GOD BLESS US. "IT'S YOURSELF..." AH, GOD BLESS US. IT'S YOURSELF, MA'AM. IT IS INDEED, FATHER. (Patrick) ...REMARKED RANDY FATHER LIAM AS HE OPENED THE DOOR TO A YOUNG WOMAN WHO BORE A STARTLING RESEMBLANCE TO MITZI GAYNOR. SO YOU ARE THE REPLACEMENT FOR MRS. MCGLYNN? (Eily) I AM INDEED, FATHER. DESTROYED WITH THE LUMBAGO, SHE IS. DESTROYED, AND THAT'S A FACT. BUT SURE SHE'LL BE BACK ON HER FEET SOON, PLEASE GOD. PLEASE GOD SHE WILL, NOW. BUT TELL ME THIS, HAVE I BEGUN TO DOTE OR DO YOU REMIND ME OF SOMEONE SPECIAL? WHEN SHE SENSED A MOVEMENT UNDERNEATH HIS BLACK SERGE TROUSERS. OH, FATHER, PLEASE, HOW COULD I? WHEN I'VE GONE OUT OF MY WAY KNOWING THAT YOUR DICKY DOODLE, NAUGHTY POOPSTER THAT HE IS, GIVEN THE SLIGHTEST ENCOURAGEMENT, WOULD BE ONLY TOO EAGER TO GET UP TO MISCHIEF. DOWN, BOY! NAUGHTY DICKY. TO CAMOUFLAGE MYSELF AND LOOK LIKE ANY ORDINARY OLD CURATE'S DRUDGE. "AND MOST DEFINITELY NOT "A PERFUME-SPRAYED VISION "NAMED MITZI GAYNOR "WITH A HEAD OF BUBBLE-CUT CURLS "THAT WOULD MAKE ANY MAN'S PRIVATES GO SPRONG." I'VE GOT THE STANDARD UNIFORM, FATHER. THE BLUE HOUSECOAT WITH THE BOW AT THE BACK, THE TAN STOCKINGS, COLOR OF STALE TEA, THE OLD HAIRNET, WHICH SAYS TO ALL THEM MICKIES WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO STAY INSIDE AND WEAR BLACK SERGE, "NO MICKIES TODAY. "DOWN, BOYS. THAT'S IT, MY SWEETS, "OFF WITH YOU AND SAY YOUR PRAYERS." BREAKFAST, FATHER? BY GOD, AND NOW YOU'RE TALKING. MICKEY IS DEVIOUS AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU TELL HIM, HE SIMPLY WON'T STAY DOWN. BUT DRAB OLD HOUSECOATS AND TEA-COLORED STOCKINGS MIGHT WELL HAVE KEPT HIM DOWN IF IT WASN'T FOR THAT PESKY SPOT OF GREASE. OH, THIS IS POWERFUL ALTOGETHER. I WOULD DO JAIL FOR ANOTHER RASHER. DO YOU KNOW THAT, EILY? I'LL FRY YOU SOME MORE THIS MINUTE, THEN, FATHER. COME HERE, LITTLE EILY. DID YOU HEAR THE ONE ABOUT PEANUTS AT CONFESSION? NO, FATHER. AT LEAST I DON'T THINK SO. SAYS THE PRIEST TO THE YOUNG FELLOW, "DID YOU THROW PEANUTS IN THE RIVER, TOO?" TO WHICH THE YOUNG LAD SAYS, "NO, FATHER, I AM PEANUTS." [chuckling] (Patrick) NOT A VERY FUNNY JOKE, BUT SHE LAUGHED AND SHE LAUGHED. IN FACT, YOU COULD SAY SHE LAUGHED UNTIL SHE CRIED. OOPS! MY SKIRT AND HOUSECOAT ARE RIDING UP. BETTER ABORT THIS TASK AT ONCE OR WE COULD HAVE AN EXPLODING CLERGYMAN FILLING THE AIR WITH PENT-UP SEXUAL ENERGY. OH, NO! PRIEST GROWS WINGS IN LATEST MIRACLE. EILY! "WHEN SHE FOUND HERSELF ENVELOPED BY HIS SKIRTS." NOW, FATHER, IS THIS ANOTHER JOKE? OW! [sobbing] THAT HURT, FATHER. FRANK SINATRA WOULDN'T DO THIS, FATHER. NEITHER WOULD VIC DAMONE. I'M ALL WET, FATHER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN THERE, FATHER? ARE YOU PLAYING SQUIDGY WITH MY FAIRY LIQUID? BUT SHE WAS SOON TO REALIZE IT WASN'T FAIRY LIQUID HE'D BEEN PLAYING WITH DOWN THERE. THE END. NO, IT WASN'T FAIRY LIQUID AT ALL. "...PRIVATES GO SPRONG." "PRIVATES GO... HOW DARE YOU? WHEN I SAID, "DEVELOP YOUR LITERARY SKILLS," I DID NOT, REPEAT, NOT, MEAN THIS. WHY DID YOU WRITE IT? I THOUGHT THERE WAS A MORAL, SIR. A LESSON, IF YOU WILL. YOUNG GIRLS IN MORTAL DANGER. GET OUT OF THIS CLASSROOM, BRADEN! TO THE DEAN'S OFFICE! HELLO, CLASS. MY NAME IS MISS KITTEN AND I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE PERILS OF BEING A PRIEST'S HOUSEKEEPER, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK LIKE MITZI GAYNOR. HANDS UP WHO CAN TELL ME WHO MITZI GAYNOR IS. SO, YOU SEE, PATRICK, WE'RE ON YOUR SIDE. WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THAT. WELL, NO, YOU'RE WRONG, FATHER. I DO. SO, IF YOU CAN THINK OF ANYTHING THAT WOULD HELP US TO HELP YOU, WELL... WELL, THERE IS ONE THING, FATHER. INSTEAD OF P.E.... YEAH. ...I COULD TAKE HOME ECONOMICS AND NEEDLEWORK CLASS. AND YOU THINK THAT WOULD HELP YOU, UH, KNUCKLE DOWN AND APPLY YOURSELF? WHAT'S THAT, PATRICK? OH, AND YOU CAN CALL ME KITTEN, FATHER. KITTEN? YES, PATRICK KITTEN BRADEN, AFTER SAINT KITTEN. WELL, NOW, THERE WAS NO SAINT KITTEN, PATRICK. OH, NO, BUT THERE WAS A SAINT CETTIN, FATHER, AND SOME HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO CALL HIM, OR WAS IT A HER, KITTEN. SAINT KITTEN? MM-HMM. HE OR SHE WAS AN ACOLYTE OF SAINT PATRICK. WORE A DRESS. AS DID SAINT PATRICK, ACTUALLY. A HAIRY DRESS. QUITE RUINED HER COMPLEXION. [Charlie laughs] AND THEY'RE FOR YOUR SISTER, PATRICK? MM-HMM. OH, SHE REALLY NEEDS A BIT OF GLAMOUR IN HER LIFE, MRS. COYLE. BUT THEN AGAIN, DON'T WE ALL? (reporter on T.V.) THE TROUBLE BROKE OUT AS THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND, MR.
