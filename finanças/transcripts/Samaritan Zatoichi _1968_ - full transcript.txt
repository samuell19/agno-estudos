A DAIEI CO. LTD. PRODUCTION You're mean! What did I do? You knocked over the basket. You stepped on the rice. How are we supposed to catch sparrows without bait? You'll have to forgive me. I'm blind. No way. You have to pay us. All right, then. Put out your hands. I'll pay you with these. Rats. No coppers? These beans are perfect for catching sparrows. Soak them in sake and scatter them on the ground. The sparrows will come flocking and have themselves a feast. Pretty soon they'll get drunk and fall asleep. Then you grab them with your bare hands. Nothing to it. That's a lie. It'd never work. You won't know unless you try, will you? Watch out, mister. You're coming to a deep spot. What did I tell you? Hello! If you would, sir! Sir! Damn it! This water is freezing. SAMARITAN ZATOICHI Original story by KAN SHIMOAWA Screenplay by KIYOKATA SARUWAKA HISASHI SUGIURA, TETSURO YOSHIDA Starring: SHINTARO KATSU YOSHIKO MITA MAKOTO SATO KOU NISHIMURA, TAKUYA FUJIOKA CHOCHO MIYAKO Directed by KENJI MISUMI I have a feeling this means someone's going to die. Unokichi, if you don't have the money, hand over your sister. She's not here. She went to get the money. You expect me to believe that? No money and no sister means we'll have to take it out of you. Relax. She'll be back tonight. We weren't born yesterday. Prepare to die! Son of a bitch! Clear out! So there! The boss here must be really tight. It's a whole fish all right, but look at that. And the soup is so thin. I can see my reflection. Take a look. Thank you for the meal. Thank you for the meal. It's all of one measly bite. The boss wants to see you. He was a stranger, but he belonged to the brotherhood. He said he needed money, so I lent him 30 ryo. Now the term is up and I've yet to see one copper from him. What do you think of a brother who does that? I'd say he's a real son of a bitch. We don't want his kind running around. My sentiments exactly. I sent my second with a couple of swordsmen to talk to him, but he came at them like a rabid dog. No man who disgraces the brotherhood like that should be allowed to live. You're absolutely right. Will you lend a hand, then? Leave it to me. I had pretty much the same thing where I stayed a couple of days ago. That time there were six men, and I mowed them all down. How many am I dealing with today? - One. Just one? Seems a little anticlimactic, but at least it'll be easy. Sure, I'll do it. Good. Take this for the road. Much obliged. He's going along? He may be blind, but if he's a brother, he has to earn his keep like anyone else. He doesn't have to join in. He can be an observer. An observer? But what about... My ears and nose are sharper than any of yours. Excuse me, but how much did he give you? One of these. A ryo? The blind bastard's an observer? What a laugh. Look, Ichi. When we get there, you just stay out of the way. I'm the one who got the big money here. I won't do a thing until you all ask me to. Good. He acts so damn calm. Hey, blind man. Mind if we pick up the pace? Go right ahead. Why did you stop so suddenly? Damn, we should have brought lanterns. It's too dark to see the path. Sounds like I can be of use after all. Watch it, buddy. We're ready. Damn it! Show yourself! He's here! Watch out! He got me! Someone tie it off for me! Son of a bitch! Sounds like he did quite a bit of damage. The bastard blew out the lamp. I guess that's rather inconvenient for you sighted folks. Come out, damn it! Or we'll burn the place down. Come out! What's so funny? There's only one guy in there, right? Why would you burn the place down for just one guy? You've got a big mouth. If you think you can do better, go right ahead. May I step forward, then? You talked big about being an observer. Let's see if your walk is as good as your talk. Don't do it, Ichi. Don't anybody get ideas about helping me out. I'm blind, so there's no telling who I might wind up cutting down. Hello, there. I'm a blind man by the name of Zatoichi. I have no personal grievance against you. But under the code I live by, I have no choice in this matter. I'd like to ask you to come outside. You come in and get me. Since I'm blind, I'll have the advantage in the dark. You've got to be kidding. A man who can't see shouldn't be playing with swords. If you want to fight, you'll have to come get me. Unokichi! Are you all right? It's me! I got the money, Unokichi! I have the money right here. How could you do this? You know very well what happens when you trample on the code. I'll give you your money. Now you give me my brother back. You take my money, you kill my brother... You're demons, all of you! - What's the real story here? - What are you doing? You owe interest for paying late. You'll pay it with your body. That's all you ever wanted, isn't it? You used my brother to get to me. Hold on. You're being unreasonable. You stay out of this. Shinsuke, you take the young lady inside. He told you to stay out of this, you blind bastard! Rokusuke, I believe it was? That's the second time you've called me a blind bastard. Damn it! He's the one who killed Unokichi! Shinsuke, no one told us a thing about the young lady, did they? No, they didn't. You're not getting away with this, you son of a bitch! We'll go talk to your boss about this. Get moving. Ichi, if you don't mind, I don't need to go with you, do I? I'd rather never see that boss's face again. I can leave, right? Get going. You've got some nerve showing your face here again! It's the master of the government inn who wants that girl. This wasn't just my orders. It was official business. What do you say to that? You're not the man I heard you were. You don't deserve to call yourself a boss. Watch it, buddy. Listen here. "No man who disgraces the brotherhood should be allowed to live." That's what you said. I guess that means I have to kill you. Shut up, you blind bastard! You called me that once too often. Kill him! Chased by the wind The wanderer drifts In his final hour Alone On the lonesome road When I've cut down someone who shouldn't have had to die, the whole world goes black. In my case, the whole world is black from the start. To the foolish ones I'll offer up The sentiments of my heart In a child's... In a child's lullaby I intended to bring the girl here tonight, but I ran into some unexpected trouble. Not that I'm asking you to give up on the girl. I've already taken further measures. Rest assured, Sode will be in your hands soon. I hope I can count on your support regarding the concession at Kofu Castle. Boss Kumakichi, you seem awfully hung up on Sode, but she's not that important to me. I'll be deciding in three days who gets the concession. Three days. I have to think about my own reputation, too. I must choose someone I know I can depend on. I will not fail you, sir. But the girl is a separate issue. You understand that. Absolutely, sir. Three days it is, then. Yes, sir. There's already a young lady in this room, but she has agreed to share. That's very kind of her. I'm grateful. It's because you're blind. Sometimes it pays to be blind. It's very good of you to share your room with me. May I offer you some of this? It can't be easy, a woman traveling alone. Might I ask where you are headed? This orange is definitely a winner. Juicy and sweet. You should try it, Miss Sode. I believe you knew it was me when you agreed to share the room. You must hate me. You're the man who killed my only brother. So it's not as if I have no feelings. But I don't hate you. My brother was going to get himself killed sooner or later anyway. He was like a different person when he drank. He got violent. I was trying to help him leave the gangster life behind. But I guess time ran out. That's my only regret. So please don't let it bother you. Besides, I'm in your debt for rescuing me. Hello, there. You made good time. Please come in. Is something wrong? It's nothing. Hey, it's Ichi. Miss Sode, as they always say, on the road you need a companion. Since we've been thrown together like this, perhaps we could travel as a pair. That's very kind of you. But I prefer to travel alone. We've finally tracked you down, Miss Sode. Come with us. Don't make this harder than it has to be. The damn blind bastard! One's a bun, two is stew Three is free, four is more Five we're alive, six for kicks Seven is heaven, eight straight Nine's fine and ten's the end Nine's fine and ten's the end What a shame. I see you're very handy with that sword, sir. I wonder if I could ask a favor. I'd like you to kill that blind man. Don't be ridiculous! Wait. I see. Now you've piqued my interest. I wouldn't mind killing him. - We'd be most grateful. But it's going to cost you. If you'll kill him for us... I can name my own price? - One ryo? - Wrong denomination. You want 100 ryo? No, one full box. One thousand ryo? Forget it, then. You idiot! Damn that blind bastard! Step right up! See if the god Tenjin brings you luck! You get ten balls for just eight mon. Knock three down and win a prize. Step right up and try your luck. Looks like you're all out. Care to put down another eight mon? No self-respecting man would give up now. No way. I've already lost 40 mon. Anyone else? Step right up. This looks like fun. I think I'll give it a try. Thank you. That'll be eight mon. Well, well, what do we have here? A stunning beauty at the rail. The secret is to hit them while they're blinded by your radiance. Here goes. Stop this pokey nonsense, dear. You have to turn it faster. What are you talking about? You're just jealous. Too bad. You missed. A little more to the left. A little low. Too bad. So close again! Hey, hey, hey! You're going too fast! - What did you do that for? Good hit! You want two more just like that! Whose side are you on? This is a business, you idiot. What's the big idea? Excuse me, could I give it a try? Sure thing. Here you go. Ten balls for eight mon. Wait a second. Aren't you blind? You sure you can do this? Just turn the thing as fast as you like. All right. Just a second, mister. Making money can't get much easier than this. This guy must be a real fool. Turn it real fast. Step right up! Miss Sode, could you hand me the balls? Knock three down and win a prize! Throw whenever you're ready! You hit it! I'd like another basket. - You're going to keep playing? - Keep 'em coming. Here goes. - Is this guy really blind? - Doesn't he ever miss? You're quitting now? Good. Here are your prizes. Sir! Your prizes. Hey! Don't call him back, you idiot! It's time to close up. He was really something, wasn't he? Way too much of something. Master Ichi. What happened? Have some sake with me. Let's go back to the inn. Why? Master Ichi. What's going on, Miss Sode? I wanted to kill you and then kill myself. You're tired, Miss Sode. I'm going to kill you. Miss Sode, you're tired. You need to get some rest. You're just tired. You're tired. You need to get some sleep. She has a terrible fever. Miss Sode, are you all right? Miss Sode, you need to get to bed. You're awake. Thanks to you, I feel much better now. The doctor said it was only a cold. You just need to rest for a couple of days. I'm sorry to put you to so much trouble. Master Ichi, forgive me. Why so formal all of a sudden? I understand it all better now. I know it was actually Boss Kumakichi who killed my brother. He lent my brother 30 ryo just so he could send me to the master of the government inn. Not realizing that, my brother fell right into his trap. So I truly don't blame you anymore. Miss Sode, what you said just now has torn away all that was weighing on my heart. From now on, I want you to feel like you can confide in me no matter what. I will. Tell me, then: Where is it you're headed? To Suwa. My aunt runs a tea shop by the entrance to the shrine there. Excuse me, sir. It's been three days. I need you to pay for your room. I also have a bill from the doctor. I'll be right there. Master Ichi. Please use this to help pay. That's all right. I don't need... No, please. I want you to take it. All right, if you insist. I'll be going out for a while. You stay here and rest. Sorry to keep you waiting. Shall we go? Is that all the bets? We're still a little short on odd. Anybody for odd? Odd. The bets are in. What do we have? Five and one... even. Excuse me. The dice don't seem to like you today. That's an understatement. But I can hardly expect pity for losing at gambling. I was wondering. To a blind man, his cane is nearly as important as his life. I wonder if you wouldn't take this against a loan of three ryo? Three ryo? If I lose, I'll give you free massages for the rest of your life. You're joking. I hardly need to be massaged for the rest of my life. A masseur's cane isn't worth three coppers. I suggest you go home before you get hurt. Wait. I'll lend you the money. I don't know who you are, but thank you very much. You had no way of knowing, but this cane is worth at least 100 ryo. You blew that one. I have one other request. Since my whole life is on the line here, could you perhaps let me handle the cup? Who will you play against? Anyone willing to go one-on-one against me. You got it. I'll take the challenge myself. All right. I'll read the dice, then. Here goes. Odd. Even. Whose funeral? Two ones... even. Thank you very much. You're good, masseur. You cheated. Abject apologies. I'll return your dice. Wrap him up and throw him in the river. You've got some nerve, you blind son of a bitch. Hello. It's Kashiwazaki. Please throw me in where it's deep. I could get hurt if it's shallow. It's your funeral, idiot. You don't get to make requests. Throw him in. Hold on a second. Well, if it isn't... Something strange is going on. Glory to the Lotus of the Supreme Law... That guy smeared mud on Boss Kumakichi's face. Could you perhaps turn him over to us? We'd be in your debt. All right. Boss Kumakichi and my boss are sworn brothers. Do what you want with him. - Thanks. I'm glad you understand. Please treat your men to a drink. That's very nice of you. Glory to the Lotus of the Supreme... Something's changed. Not being a whore, I'm not used to being passed around in a reed dress. Where's Sode? Tell us where she is, damn it! You want us to slice you up? Spill it, you son of a bitch. This is getting dangerous. Hey! Stop! Damn it! We told you to stop! Hey, stop! He stabbed me in both wrists, damn it! Don't be afraid. He doesn't have his cane sword. Turn him into mincemeat. It's his cane sword! Damn it! Why don't you mind your own business? If Ichi's here, Sode can't be far away. Find her! Pretty good. You scare them off just by striking a pose. You're quite the comedian. Could I have my cane back now? If you want it, you'll have to come get it. Kashiwazaki, if you're a samurai, then die like a samurai. You murdered our master's martial arts teacher. You can't run far enough to escape punishment. The master sent us! Prepare to die! We carry out our master's wishes! There's no need to strike him again. Masseur, you're the one I'm after. Since I'm blind I can't run or hide. But I have to go to Suwa now. If we must face off, let it be in Suwa. Going with that woman, I suppose. Miss Sode? Your companion has departed. She asked me to give you this when you returned. Much obliged. Could you read it for me? "I decided I wanted to travel alone after all. Thank you for all your help. Please take care of yourself. Sode." Please hurry. Excuse me. I'm blind. Please, mister. Take me to Suwa. Hey, hey. I'm not a horse driver. It's a matter of life and death. Thanks so much. Please hurry. I don't seem to have a choice. You've got to hurry. I really need you to go faster. Walking isn't going to do it. I need you to run. This is just too slow. Wait! Stop! Halt! - You don't want to die, do you? - You're not giving us the slip again. Turn around, bearers. You'll be paid well. Hurry it up! No monkey business! Get moving! Master Ichi! Yes! Master Ichi! Whoa! We're going too far! Stop! Drop dead, blind bastard! She's getting away. Woman. Are you alone? Where's your blind companion? Some men are after you, aren't they? I'll be your protector. Give us the woman. Give her to us or it's your head. What's it going to be? If you want her, you'll have to fight me. Son of a bitch! Get lost! Ichi! What happened? - Is that you, Shinsuke? Have you seen Miss Sode? Miss Sode? Why would she be wandering around here? What's going on? Lend me a shoulder, will you? I've got to get to Isawa. Forget it. There's no way I'm going back there. Kumakichi's men got Miss Sode. What? That's different. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. What did you want at this hour? It's been three days, sir. That's right, isn't it? You promised a decision about the concession at the castle. I don't need you to remind me. I've made my choice. I'm delighted to hear it. Thank you very much, sir. I didn't say I chose you. The concession will go to Tahei of Katsunuma. But, sir! How could you? After all I've done for you, was everything for naught? What have you ever done for me? Don't be ridiculous. All you've ever done is sponge off my name for your own benefit. Please wait, sir. I've found Sode for you. My men will have her here in just an hour or two. Please, sir. You should be ashamed of yourself, Kumakichi. I have my own sources of information. I know all about how some blind man helped Sode escape from you. Go home. I never want to see your face again. Don't be a fool! What do you think... Boss! What have you done? I've brought some tea, sir. Somebody there? Just a dog, I suppose. I smell blood. Blood? The place is wide-open. They should be more careful. Yikes, he's dead! A woman, too. It's not Miss Sode, is it? You check. It's not Miss Sode. Then they didn't bring her here after all. Let's go. Hold it right there, Zatoichi. First you freed Sode, and now you've killed the master of the government inn. What the hell are you talking about? When we got here, they were both already... Shinsuke, protesting that we're innocent won't do any good. But we didn't kill anyone. Mow 'em down! Son of a bitch! Hey! Wha... Let's get out of here, Ichi. So long. SWEET BEAN JELLY Please make yourself comfortable. Goodness! Sode! Are you alone? Where's your brother? You said you'd drag him back here with a rope if you had to. What happened? Come inside. So Unokichi's dead. I could say I told you so. I know you loved him, but you should never have sold your body to get money for him. You can't stay here. Kinsuke from the brothel has been asking for you every day. If he finds you here, you'll never get away again. You have to run away while you still can. Gracious sakes! Why does he have to bother me now? Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. That'll be 12 mon. All right. Here's 16, so you owe me 4 in change. You want change? Of course. I suppose you would. It's too much trouble. I'll give you a discount next time. I'm too busy to make change right now. Here you go, sir. Good-bye. Heavens! It's Kinsuke. You have to hide. Quick. No, not here. In there. Don't come out. How are you today? - I hear Sode's back. - She is? She hasn't come here. Don't lie to me. I talked to someone who saw her. How could that be? If she were back, she'd come here first. But I haven't seen her, so... Maybe she ran off again. - Enough games! She's not here. She's not here, I tell you. Stop it! Haven't you had enough? A person should know when enough is enough. It's time you accepted Sode is gone for good. Watch it, lady. - Aunt Haya. - I told you not to come out. It's all right. I can't let them keep harassing you like this. I'll come to the brothel tomorrow. Please leave now. - Aren't you cheeky! You'll come now. - What are you doing? Let go of her. I told you I'd come. If I intended to run away, I'd never have come home. You're all up late. Is something going on? Move on! It has nothing to do with you. Coming through. What's with you? I had a little too much fun with a maid at an inn, and when I couldn't pay, they took all my clothes. What a loser. Move on! Thanks. So long. That was funny. I used the Edo dialect so they wouldn't recognize me. You're a clever trickster, Ichi. They must be making fun of me. Looks like I made you catch cold. A small price to pay for this much fun. Well, Ichi, I think I'll say farewell here. I really like you, but being around you means a little too much excitement for me. Perhaps I'll come see you again after I've unwound a bit. Very good. Shinsuke. My thanks. The main road's too risky, so stay on back roads. And don't press your luck. So long. You needn't worry, Kumakichi. I've posted double and triple guards at key points all along the highway. There's no way he can slip through our net. That's why it seems odd we haven't caught him yet. You suppose he could already be here in Suwa? I doubt it. - What's the situation here in town? - My men are on full alert. This is the only way Ichi can get to Suwa. Keep a close watch. With Boss Kumakichi himself turning out, this is becoming a big deal. No, now that your boss has given us all you folks to help in the hunt, it's only a matter of time. We've got the bastard cornered like a rat. Goodness! What in the world... Oh, you're blind. We're closed today. - I'm not here for a snack. Are you Miss Sode's aunt? Yeah, I'm her aunt. Who are you? I met Miss Sode on the road. You were her masseur, I suppose. Not really. Actually, she asked me to keep this for her, and I wanted to return it. That was Sode's... I recognize it. She was here, all right. But she's out of reach now. I'll give it to her when I have the chance. - Where has she gone? - The brothel. The biggest one in town. It's called Kinpeiro. She went voluntarily. Wait. What a strange masseur! Remember, your professional name is now Hanaguruma. You're a fortunate girl... having such a fine patron from your very first day. You should thank your lucky stars. It's Boss Kumakichi of Isawa. You want him to treat you well, so make sure not to offend him. He's at Boss Sashichi's place now. Go let him know we're ready for him. Hey, mister. We have lots of pretty girls. Welcome. Come right in, sir. We have lots of pretty girls. Right this way. Welcome. I'd like to see a lady named Miss Sode. There's no one here by that name. Miss Sode! Are you here? Master Ichi. Miss Sode. I thought I'd find you here. Master Ichi. My goodness! Is that from the horse? - It's good to hear your voice again. I'm afraid I have to hurry on my way, but I wonder... Could I have a few words with you? Madam, I owe this man my life. Please let me have a few minutes to speak with him. All right. Please come this way. Thank you so much. You know what to do. Thank you. Much obliged. Master Ichi! I'm so relieved that... Miss Sode, what you're doing is wrong. No matter what may have happened in the past, you still must strive for happiness, at least for yourself. But what else could I do? What are you doing? Aren't there any windows? There's a skylight. A skylight? Master Ichi. I'm getting you out of here. You mustn't! You know it can only make things worse for you. I can take care of myself. I'll go first and pull you up after me. All right? Here goes. Are you okay? I'll pull you up after me. Hold on to that. They've escaped. The masseur and girl are gone. Master Ichi, why are you doing this for me? I'm the one who took away your happiness. This is the least I can do to make amends. You stay here. - What are you going to do? When the sun comes up, it'll be a new year. I'll be back before the first drum starts beating at Suwa Shrine. That's a promise. Wait for me right here. Idiots! How could you let this happen? Don't just sit there. Go find them! Don't worry, Kumakichi. I don't keep a whole stable of retainers for nothing. Besides, it's only a blind man and a girl. We'll get them in no time. Simmer down. What are you blubbering about? I believe Boss Kumakichi is here. You're the one who killed the master of the government inn, aren't you? What are you talking about? You killed him. Slice him up! You're the one who killed him, aren't you? I don't know a thing about it. Are you saying you'd rather lie than live? It was me. I did it. I was wrong, Ichi. Forgive me. By the way, Kumakichi, I think there's something you want to give me. The money they paid you for Miss Sode. What? It's only natural you would want to set things right. Give him the money, Sashichi. Damn it! Are you going to stand there and let me die? - How much is it? - Thirty ryo. Don't be funny. You've forgotten the interest. Fifty ryo, 100 ryo... whatever. Just hurry and give it to him. I'm begging you. Kill him! In the dark, the advantage is all mine. Fools! This is a disaster! Boss Sashichi and Boss Kumakichi have both been killed. Masseur, I'll take the girl. And now that we're in Suwa, I'll take your head, too. Master Ichi. You could get hurt. Stand back. - But... - Miss Sode, did you want to go with this man? If so, I won't say a word. If not, I can't let him have his way. Master Ichi! It's all over now. Miss Sode, I want you to have a happy life. How can I ever be happy after you've gone away? Listen to that loud drumbeat. It's going to be a good harvest again this year. Master Ichi. There she is! Here, take this. Come with us. - Don't try to resist. - Master Ichi! We paid a lot of money for you. Until you've paid that money back, you'll do as we say. Come along! Master Ichi! THE END ©1968 DAIEI CO. LTD.
