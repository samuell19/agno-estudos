Engsub by indespensible 'The distance between the sun's rays..' '..and our earth is the reason why our world still exists.' 'But in the last two years, the sun's heat is increasing considerably.' 'And the threat of global warming has increased.' 'And in order to save the world, he conducted many experiments.' 'He mixed many metals together and created a sun shield..' '..which could absorb, the immense heat from the sun.' 'In order to establish the sun shield in the middle of the earth..' '..those saints had to face many threats and difficulties.' 'But finally they reached the centre of the earth in Africa..' '..and handed over that shield to the tribe's chief.' 'He said, after the end of every solar eclipse..' '..the first ray of the sun should fall on that shield.' 'And if that doesn't happen, then that could mean the end of the world.' 'Which means only that sun-shield can save the world.' 'Since then, the Hojo tribesmen..' '..started calling that shield as their deity Jua..' '..and they've been protecting it till now.' 'For the Russian army's general Katrochi..' '..the sun-shield is a unique double-edged sword.' 'That has the power to protect the world and destroy it.' 'It has the power to absorb the sun's heat, so it can save the world.' 'And on the other hand, the unlimited solar energy trapped inside..' '..can be used to create earthquake, tsunami..' '..and other natural calamities to destroy the world.' 'It's more dangerous than an atom bomb.' 'And so he wondered, if he gets the sun-shield..' '..then the world will bow before him.' 'The Hojo tribe is celebrating today..' '..because a youngster from their tribe has returned..' '..after finishing his studies.' 'His name is Hoodo.' Bring that Jua. If it falls in wrong hands, then that would mean the end of the world. Keeping it safe until the next solar eclipse is now your responsibility. 'Sanskrit shlok' 'Sanskrit shlok' 'Sanskrit shlok' 'Sanskrit shlok' A diamond is invaluable to a fool. That priceless shield will soon be in my hands. This is my time. Katrochi time. All thanks to you, my friend. Excuse me. Mambo, you found Jua, didn't you? We tried our best. But we couldn't get our hands on it. Our men are looking for it. As soon as we get it, we'll inform you. What? Sorry, sir. We couldn't get it. - What? Mambo.. I didn't give you 1 billion to listen to your sorry. It's a deal for you, but this is my dream. Give me one month's time. - I'll give you one month. Jua should be in my hands. Or you'll be looking at your death. This is your last chance. I'll kill you. All my dreams are shattered. Dammit. Send some angel to find Jua!

Jacky! Jacky! Jacky! Jacky! Jacky! Jacky! Jacky! Jacky! Jacky! Jacky! Jacky! I hope Jacky's body is insured, because my friend's going to win. I see..such overconfidence. He's fought Raju the fighter as well. He got 1256 stitches all over his body. Let's make a bet if you're not scared. - Really..we'll see. There's still time, be a good friend and take Jacky back alive. If anyone's going to die, it will be Akhil. Who needs enemies when we have you? Hey..see, Jacky's punch power. He's down with a single punch. "English rap song" Yeah! Hey..calling him Jacky, doesn't make him Jackie Chan. Take my advice. Better take him to the hospital before you've to take him to the grave. Get lost. You're a lion, my son. You're a star. Police's commission 50,000..and 50,000 for me. And 100,000 for me. The next fight is in Golconda. Be there my boy. Okay, brother. - I'll leave.

Whether it's Sultan or Multan, I am going to win. "English rap song" "English rap song" Akhil. My friend, my brother. Why are you crying? - A girl hit me with her shoe. But why? - I said I loved her. And she hit you. Is she crazy? Yes, she's crazy about education. When I proposed to her, she asked about my degree. And when I asked her to have a cup of coffee with me.. ..she said I don't drink coffee with poor boys like you. What? And she also asked what's the difference between.. ..gigantic twins and mono gigantic twins. If a brother becomes a dacoit and the other becomes a police.. ..then they are gigantic twins. Exactly, that's what I said too. Did she give you her number? - She whacked me again. What? If one becomes a police and the other a dacoit then they are gigantic twins. And if both become dacoits, then they are mono gigantic twins. When she whacked me for the second time.. ..she had already planned for a third. You mean another question. What is the difference between red blood cells and white blood cells? Just the color. - I said the same thing. What then? She hit me with her friend's shoe. - You mean that's wrong as well. She said that red blood cells supply oxygen.. ..and the white blood cells come in use when we're sick. She said that you and all your friends are stupid. Why the.. Didn't she go to a beauty parlor instead? At the college we've to listen to the professors. At home it's the parents and the maid. I wonder why they feel offended if we admire their beauty.. No one asks so many questions in an interview as well. Don't we have desires? Where do we go with our desires? How long will we keep watching Bhojpuri channel to please ourselves? This is enough. Let's go. Call out her name so loud that it makes her shudder. Hey educated bumpkin. Witch with a degree. Come face me if you're a man. My friend here will solve all those questions in your head! Show yourself! Hey Jojo! Jojo! Jojo! Where were you going? Come. Why were you barking like a dog? Didn't you get enough beating for a day? You've lost your mind. Not me, my friend will teach you a lesson.. This is what you did the other day. Give respect to ladies..and they will give you respect too. Always ready to stare and ogle at girls. I am ashamed to call you a friend. You've stooped so low. Did you change sides? What side? - It's what he does? Party's all night and lies in some gutter. Then I have to bring him back home every day. I said you should study and open a saloon. But he doesn't listen. I said you should look after your parents. But he detests them. That's why he's still here, and I got to Cambridge. Really? You did your medical studies from Cambridge? Not that just. His papa studied from Howrah bridge. His grandpa from London Bridge. Everyone in his family studied under some bridge. Cambridge is okay. Is there a university called Howrah Bridge? It was before the independence. But the British took it with them. Very nice. By the way, what did you specialize in? Cardiac..orthopedic..gastronomy or pediariatic? Actually..I am a animal doctor. - Really? Yes..if a human falls sick, he can go to the hospital.. ..pay his bills and get well. But what about animals. We can't understand their language. They speak from their eyes and need someone to understand. You have such high thoughts. Correct-correct. He can fit a crow's kidney to a pigeon. He's that great. Wow..transplant. - He even treated a crocodile. He had a cavity in his teeth. He pulled his tooth out, and put one of his. And he's really happy. - That's enough. Crocodile can't praise you, at least let me. You're great. - Marvelous. You won't believe, I've been looking for you. Shake hands. - Don't embarrass me. I am the lucky one to meet you. No, neither you nor me are lucky. Jojo is the lucky one. He's in pain. What's wrong? He looks fine. He doesn't have too long. Does he have AIDS? - Quiet. Continue. Jojo has a hole in his heart. I took him to a lot of doctors. But no one's ready to operate on him. You must operate on him, please. He's so small..and his heart's even smaller. And he's also got a hole in his heart. - Don't worry, Jojo's quite big. He once operated on an ant. He will make him well again.. ..and soon he will be prancing around with a carrot in his mouth. You don't worry. Fantastic. So when do we operate? Let's not waste time. Okay. See you tomorrow. Okay. - Thank you. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Bye. Bye. - Bye. What were you blabbering? You changed sides for the girl, and I changed sides for Jojo. Bloody.. Look, you were impressed by the girl now, how do we impress the rabbit? It's not that difficult. We just need a scapegoat. Where will we find a goat? Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Listen you Equus africanus asinus (Donkey) Come here. Sir, when did you learn French? It's not French. It's the English name for a donkey. So Mr. Donkey, how dare you bunk class and smoke here. Go to your class. - Okay, sir. Hey, Suscrofadomesticus! (pig) Come here. Sir, that's not my name. - Shut up. It's the scientific name for a pig. And your nickname. Were you peeing behind the tree or trying to flee? Sir, I.. - Go to the class. That side is the canteen, class is this way. I am very strict. Found my scapegoat. Excuse me, may I come in? Yes, come in. "Is she a girl..or a beautiful angel?" "Look at her gorgeous body." "Her attitude, her eyes are bewitching." "Some crazy lover might fall for her." - Are you alone? Of course. Do you see anyone else here? - You naughty. What are you doing? Someone might see us. Go and take your lectures. - I want to take your lecture. Leave that, you can give me a lesson in love later. First go and teach chemistry to the students. I will teach them, but first let's think about our chemistry. Biology. Students have a slip of tongue, and my heart skips a beat when I see you. Look..my heart will not slip. Now you slip out of here. Go! You don't understand my feelings at all. Stupid. She called me stupid? Me? May I come in? - Come in. Hello, sir. - Who are you guys? Do you have an appointment? - We bribed the peon. Even I bribed for this post. What do you want? - Your support. What for? - I am in love with a girl in your college. And I need your help you woo her. What? You come in my college without permission. And you're asking for my help to fall in love with my student. How dare you? Only those who dare fall in love. Help this poor boy, and I can make her mine. If you don't get out now, I will get you all arrested. Get out. - I see..show him. Yes, show me. Presenting rising star Dr. Prasad.. ..and sexy siren Kokila madam's performance. In Chunri Giri Pungi Uthi. "Slip.." "Slip.." "Slip.." "Slip.." "Slip.." No! What's this? Even T20 doesn't show so many replays. But there's a technical fault. This show that I am pulling her veil. - That's what we want to show. Oh no..I haven't done anything like that. Do you have a defect? - What? The students will decide what he did and what not? If we put it on facebook, he will be famous. Shut up, we'll put it on Youtube. He'll get lots of likes. Stop it. Facebook..Youtube. He's the Principal, not some ordinary man. A big personality like him and all you can think if Facebook and Youtube. We'll show it on big screen. What do you say, sir? What must I do so you can delete this video? Heart surgery of a rabbit. We need your help. Are you out of your mind? It is very complicated. More than pulling someone's veil. When is the operation? - Tomorrow morning. What's wrong? So many candles in the morning? Are you thinking about protesting at the powerhouse? Not at all..we're praying to God for Jojo's safe recovery. Everything will be fine with His blessings. If Jojo doesn't survive, then they will slice me open. Jojo. - Divya. Wear your mask. Is he dead? No. He's dreaming. Hello, sir. Do you remember everything? I never studied so hard for my exam either. Fine..good boy. Wow..you can praise as well. Just do as much as you're told. Won't you wear your mask? - Oh yes, thanks for reminding. Close the door? - No-no-no..I'll have signal problem. Signal problem? I mean..even prayers have a frequency. So many people are praying outside and he should get those blessings. Now see his heart..and make an incision there. Why are your hands shaking? - What to do I love animals. I would've sliced open a human immediately. Don't worry, do it. - I can't do it. What happened? He's your rabbit. So I want you to get the credit of saving him. Take this knife. Don't worry, cut it. Just like you cut a gourd. He's bleeding heavily. He's bleeding heavily. Why are you repeating my words? Clean it with cotton, don't you know that. Clean it with cotton, don't you know that. What happened? Is he breathing? No. He's dead. Jojo. Wake up, Jojo. I can't think of living without you. How much overacting she is doing. Wake up, Jojo. Pleas open your eyes. Jojo. Operation successful! Yeah! Jojo spice is ready. We'll fry half and sauté the rest. What say? - He's alive. Even after you operated on him? That operation connected our hearts. Hey.. Thank you so much, Akhil. You gave Jojo and me a new life. He performed such a complicated operation for you.. ..and you're simply thanking him. - Correct. You made me really happy.. ..so I want you to be a part of my happiness. There's no need, but I won't refuse if you insist. I am getting married on the 25th. You must all come to my wedding. Bye. She whacked me with a shoe and hacked your heart in half. What do we do now? - We'll go eat at her wedding. This is not some loan from a friend which you can forget. It's my love. I am going to spend this lifetime with her. Find out everything about her groom. Ice is just like us. Whether its whiskey or buttermilk, it mixes with both. Only God knows who will mix with me. Drink it down. That guy in the brown coat, he's Divya's future husband. Sorry, you're her future husband. What is this? - Injection. It will put him to sleep for 24 hours. There's a guy waiting outside. They will take him to the jungle. And he will wander in the jungle like Tarzan. What if he doesn't wake up? - He'll be Sharekhan's dinner. I'll be back guys. Hello. Fatima. How many times do I tell you? I felt worse than mother-in-law did. I swear on father-in-law, I am not ready for this marriage. I am hopeless, I am helpless. I am useless. And so I am being shameless and saying don't wait for this careless. Marry the Sheikh that your father likes. You go.. go live your life, Fatima. Fatima. I miss you. Hey man..trouble in love. - Yes, what do you care? Because I can bring happiness back. Great! Cheers. It's not as easy as you think to stop this wedding. That girl's father is a very dangerous man. I'll tell you a small incident to explain you that. Please come in. I hope you had no trouble on the way. I live on one end of this block, and you live on the other end. How can it be any trouble? It's just a formality, I didn't mean it. Come in. Let's begin the engagement. Wait. Where's the catechu? This is the limit. Someone swallowed it up. Can we use tobacco instead? I've a lot of those. Instead of shaking hands..can I shake hands with your cheek? He slapped my father for forgetting the catechu. He's also the member of some mafia group. You tell me, what do I do? If I don't marry her, my life is over. If love is true, then put everything at stake. Don't be scared. You're fortunate to find such a beautiful girl with this face. Don't worry, I will handle everything. Before this night ends, Fatima will be your wife. How dare he run away one day before the wedding? And who is Fatima? I know Priyanka, I also know Aishwarya. I don't know who Fatima is. I will kill you. How dare you humiliate me, bloody bugger? You're thinking about burger in this situation. You can hit me later, I am getting a call. It's that devil calling. Switch to speaker. Papa, are you alright? - Did you call to ask that? You just wrote a letter and enjoying your honeymoon. And you left me here to face Sultan's wrath. Did that stupid fool find out? You're on speaker, everyone's listening. Look..they are far richer than us. His daughter wanted a middle class husband, so she chose you. Just come back and marry her. The girl wants a simple husband.. ..and that old man wants a full time servant. I don't want to be that rascal's son-in-law. Not a word more. You used to be such a coward. Who made you so courageous? Did she kidnap you? No last night I met God at the bar. After how many pegs? - Don't worry, I paid the bill. Keep talking. He said that a lover's heart should be filled with fire. There's no place for fear in love. And you believed he's God. He said that the father's after the money.. ..and the daughter's after education. And he got me and Fatima married. Give it to me. Who is he? What is his name? He disconnected. Give me back my smartphone, it costs 1000. Daddy. - My child. Divya, what is this melodrama? It's a good thing that he left you before the wedding. What if he had left you after the wedding? Look around, and you will find another handsome boy. Like me..someone who won't read your whatsapp or Facebook. Like me. Correct. You're right. My name's Akhil sir. - So what? Dear, I will find someone more handsome and richer than him. Bloody old man.. Uncle. - What? You're making the same mistake again. You should offer sweet to someone who doesn't have diabetes. You're giving diamond to a monkey again. So what? Find someone who is interested in your daughter, not your balance sheet. And then she will be happy. Yes, I won't care about the guy's background. I don't care even if his bank balance is zero. But he must love my daughter. My daughter will marry him. Come daughter. Thank God..that's over. Go and express your love. You fool..it's not some charity. I will ask for it with my right. Sir. - What happened, Mambo? Did you find him or not? - No, sir. I can't give this answer to Katrochi. We don't have time. I want Jua before the next solar eclipse. You don't worry, sir. My men are on the job. They will find him. You mean, another problem. Yes, emotionally Mukesh said.. ..that he will marry his daughter to someone who truly loves her. But the truth is he loves poor and orphans. He's a orphan, why will he let him marry his daughter? What if he has a family? - Then he will give it a thought. If that's true, then I will create a happy family. It's not like opening an account on Facebook, you need an family. If we can make a fake account, then why not a fake family. I'll get a family on loan. - And where will you find that? You mean that me and my family.. ..should dress up traditionally and carry sweets on our head.. ..accept that you're my son, and ask for his daughter's hand. Correct sir. My friend won't find an educated father like you. Couldn't you find someone else? If I had a useless son like you, I would've chucked him out. You're not worthy of being my neighbor. Get out before I cut you open. We'll leave, sir..but what if this goes out of our phone? Help! - Say yes, daddy. Daddy? - You cheat, rascal..I knew it. When I wanted a son, you got me sterilized. Who is the mistress? Catch the knife. Super catch. Dear, your son saved you from becoming a widow. Son for my mistress, and nothing for me. Oh God, take my husband away. You're getting me wrong. This is about love. I see..first the arranged marriage and this it was love marriage. Anyone else? Mother-in-law, he is involved with someone else. Shameless. You have two children. Aren't you ashamed? Go and die. Grandma, please don't yell at him. I was an orphan since birth. Due to inflation even my relatives refused to adopt me. But I never missed my family. But..there are terms and conditions in love as well. So I need a family. I disturbed your family to make my family. Sorry. Wait, brother. I will help you. Who are you to help him? You're so small, and making such tall claims. Will they say yes if I go too? - Mother. Son, marriage is the union of two hearts. Uniting two hearts is a good deed. - You're right, mother-in-law. So you've changed sides too. Why? Don't you remember that one time? - Be quiet. I suggest that you stay at home. If they ask about the boy's father we'll say he's in Central jail. Let's go. - Okay. Wait! You're no ordinary person. People take possession on other's land. But you've possessed my family. I'll show you. Are they security guards or gangsters? I wonder how the father's going to be. Mother, I am scared. He's in love. - Yes. So he's going to marry her. - Yes. So why are you scared? I am with you. Show some courage. You're giving me courage. Let's go. - Come. How dare you ask my daughter's hand in marriage? Do you know who you are? Mother. Then why did you post an ad in the paper.. ..that you want a poor son-in-law. I'll show you my poverty. Where is my gun? Please, sir. - Get lost. What do you want? - I don't know, he brought me here. What's in the platter? - Token. We're Akhil's family member. Tell me something, are you here to propose to my daughter on his behalf? Actually, my mother.. Mother. Mother. Mother. Who are you calling? - My mother. She disappeared. Like the horns on a donkey. Don't talk nonsense. Just tell me why you came here? Actually, we came here to invite you for our daughter's wedding. She is still so small. Why are you in such a haste. She just remembered her husband from her last life.. ..and she wants to marry him again. How educated is she? - 9th pass. And the boy? - 10th fail. Give me the invitation card. - I haven't printed one. You didn't print the cards? - No, I did.. But I forgot to get it. Hey..I got the cards printed, but couldn't get my daughter married. And you're here to invite me to the wedding without the cards. Get lost. Where is mother? - You came back alive. O mother, you were being so brave out here. And you lost all your courage inside. What to do? He was holding a gun. If this had happened 20 years ago then I would've pinned him to the ground. Don't worry, mom. His daughter isn't here? She has flown out to Spain because her marriage was cancelled. How can she go to Spain? - Why not? Now you can leave to, so we can live in peace. Stop saying such things to him. Then I must go to Spain as well. Then I must go to Spain as well? She's gone to Spain, not Jhumri Telaiya. And I can't sponsor tickets to Spain. It's not a big thing. Mortgage this house. Mind your tongue. This house is already mortgaged. We need 200,000 more for your heart operation. And I am buying your medicines on credit card. You leave, son. - Don't say that. Poor boy's in trouble. You think he's really your son! He's a clever boy. Rob a bank, get in street fight or bet on cricket match to make money. Thank you father, that's a good idea. Idea? I just said like that. I hope he doesn't actually rob a bank. Akhil. What's wrong with you? He won..my boy won. You lost for the first time. We would've got 200,000 if you had won. I was offered 500,000 for losing. What will you do with that money? What is this? - Money for grandma's operation. Why will you pay for my mother's operation? I will get it done myself when I get the money. Would you have refused if I was really your son? We are always busy in earning money.. ..but our real wealth is our mother. Only an orphan can know the value of parents. Please, don't say no. And your Europe tour. - That's where I am going. My flight leaves in two hours. See you, mother. Akhil. Normally boys like you who fail in love, end their life. But you're giving a new life to my mother. From today, my family is always with you. I am no longer an orphan now. 'Sanksrit chant' 'Sanksrit chant' 'Sanksrit chant' 'Sanksrit chant' 'Sanksrit chant' 'Sanksrit chant' Excuse me. - Yes. Your ID card, ma'am. - Oh.. Medical student. - Yeah. You? My name is Budo, I am working in this apartment. Okay. Thank you. Good day, ma'am. - Good day. Akhil. Oh my, God. What are you doing here? The guys at Cambridge insisted, so I had to come. But Cambridge is in London. Exactly. They are opening a new branch here. And they want me to the branch head. And what's wrong with you? Even Munni wasn't so hurt when she got defamed. And you flew all the way to Spain to study. I wasted 2 lakhs. I didn't come here to study, I came here to kill someone. Who? - The one who broke my marriage. Kishore's friend. I found out that Kishore came here after getting married. So I took admission here. If I get my hands on Kishore, then I will find his scoundrel friend too. Why don't you listen to Kishore Kumar's sad songs too? You will forget all about Kishore. But I will punish him. I was humiliated on Facebook because of him. People stopped liking my photos. What's the point of taking such nice selfies. So frustrating. - That's cruel. People stopped following me on Twitter as well. Papa had to face humiliation as well. My father's sad about my broken marriage. I came here to kill his friend. I will get married only after I kill his friend. I will kill him. But we must find that Kishore first. As you wish. I will help you too. - Really? Yeah. - Thank you so much, Akhil. Until I don't find him I won't touch food, facebook, water, whatsapp. Where is that bloody Kishore? I've taken a month off from the job. We're going to have fun on our honeymoon. Day and night only romance. No one will disturb us. Who is it, Fatima? Take a look. Hi. - Brother? You, here? Is Kishore at home? - You? How did you find us? By make Fatima's mother swear on her father You risked your life for the sake of our happiness and got us married. So why do you look so sad? Come in. - Let it be, he won't come in. Why did you come here? - Remember that girl, Divya. Yes. - She is coming here. Divya? Does she know the address? If she asks who helped you, what will you say? I will tell her the truth, that you did. Don't take my name. - Then whose name should I take. I.. Me.. Myself.. Who are you? - Baburao Khote. Good for nothing. - Absolutely right. You Indians can't make an honest living.. ..and you don't value someone like me. He was running around in the market with dog biscuits. If you take his name, then Divya's anger will calm down. And you will be spared. - But what will he do? I will accept your accusation. In order to wash away my sins, an astrologer said.. ..that I must help lovers. You two are lovers, aren't you? And you need my help. Yes, we do, we do. - I will. She is here. Hey..tell me who got you married and helped you escape. That's me. Why? So it's you. Why did you do it? What a stupid question. Why do children bunk school? For fun. Why do they deflate tires? For fun. Even I did it for fun. - What did you say? You broke my marriage for fun. Even humiliated my father. I can even break bones for uniting two lovers. Don't stare at me. Will you hit me? I know karate. Kung fu as well. Do you know Savitri? - Savitri? One who brought her husband back to life? This is another Savitri. Khali's female version. - Mother..save me..I am dead. What do you think? Baburao will be scared hearing Savitri's name. You can call anyone you like. I am not scared. I won't budge. Call her. Quickly. Savitri! 'Regional song' 'Regional song' Her name doesn't match her personality. Doesn't matter, we'll change her name. Is he the one? I see..so she's Savitri. Look sister, I won't fight you. Because I am an Indian. So don't bring your height in our fight. So please go back. I'm an Indian too. How? Mother was from Kanpur and father Nigerian. Oh my..couldn't your mother find someone else. Were all the boys of Kanpur dead? We're not here to discuss family matter. - So. We'll talk about the family you humiliated. That's the corporation's job. Not yours. You don't worry, I will handle her. I will show her Goa's beaches. - Great. Oh God, I am dead. Oh God, I am dead. This is no way to hit anyone. Doesn't suit a woman. You look like such a descent woman. Oh God, I am dead. Father, save me. She's cleaning her clock. - Hey, stop it. Stop you oaf. - Oh, God! Hey, take a break. Kishore, go and save him. - I am not going anywhere near her. Not there? - Then? Just wave at her. - You will beat me? What is this? What will you take for going away? There's a way to hit people. You're playing me like a drum. I am going. Is there anything left? How much more are you going to hit me? Go back to Kanpur. 'Regional song' Go away..I didn't hit you, so you don't hit me either. 'Regional song' Go away. Go! Run. - Hey, wait. Savitri, don't spare him. - She is not leaving me.. Stop it. What is this? Look, I am sparing you because you're a woman. What is Baburao's fault? Will you kill him for uniting two lovers? You will never understand love. - What did you say? You mean she can never fall in love. - Exactly. That's why she doesn't have a boyfriend. You're saying too much. I don't have a boyfriend because I never even tried. If I say yes, boys will queue up after me. You can try as hard as you want. Let's see if you can make one boyfriend. I will fall at your feet and apologise. It's a promise. I accept on her behalf. She will find a boyfriend in one week. Be ready to apologise. Right? - Yes, this is my challenge. That's my challenge also. Prove it. Can she do it? - Don't ask me, ask her. Yes! Divya. Coffee. It's been six days. Find someone handsome and trusting, or you will lose the bet? You're right. How's that chocolate boy? 'Relax.' Oh, Divya you're too much. There's something called as color combination. I admit stains are good, but not for a lifetime. Correct. What about that Chinese? China..total loss. Every part will be duplicate! Where will I find an original piece? Sometimes what you need is right in front of you.. ..but still you need to look around. You've already seen the DP, but you haven't liked it yet. Yes..there is one boy. - Who is he? He's Russian. His name is Dupaski. He sits next to me in my class. He's perfect for me. Russians only understand revolution, and not relations. Only Indians can understand that. Indian boy.. Where will I find an Indian boy? 'She's just as stupid as her father. He's right in front of you.' Oh yes, I found one. - Who? You? Who else? - Me? Yes, Akhil. You're the closest to me. You mean.. - Why don't you be my boyfriend? Are you joking with me? - 100 percent, Akhil. From now on you're my boyfriend. Nothing is more important than winning the bet. Yes, you're right. Our chemistry should shake up his biology. I will shatter his arrogance, pride and anger. We will. Together we'll make this mission possible, okay. See you tomorrow. Akhil. Will you able to pretend to love me? "Why does anyone fall in love?" "Brings him in his life?" "Loves him..and trusts him with his life." "This heart.." "This heart.." "Oh my, this heart.." "This heart.." "This heart.." "Oh my, this heart.." This is my hiding place. Hey, she is the mental Vikram's daughter. Yes, that's her. Who's that boy who she's hugging so tightly? I've seen him somewhere. He's the same guy who encouraged me to marry Fatima. I see.. Hello. Rotten tomato, who are you torturing this time? What is it? Why did you call now? Your insolent daughter who was yelling at us.. ..is roaming around with that Akhil and openly displaying her romance. It's easy to slap anyone when you've power and money. Now..what can you do about Akhil? You're in India, and he's in Spain. Bloody.. - You bloody, and your daughter too. Godwin. - Sir. Book ticket for Spain immediately. Oh my, God. What happened? Please..please help me. What is this? You've been shot. Who did this? Bodo, you need to take this injection immediately. Thank you, ma'am. Go that side, that side. Hey you.. He intentionally killed himself. He told the secret of Jua..to the one who pulled the bullet out. And saved his life. People of his tribe never lie. Find that doctor who treated him. Find him. You're joking, right. - I am not joking, I am serious. You don't know the truth about me. I cannot lie to you anymore. I fell in love with you since the day, I saw you. That's why I got Kishore out of my way. I know I was wrong, but I had no choice. I did what I thought was right to make you mine. There's nothing right or wrong in love. Oh..you wanted to tell me the truth.. ..after finding out whether I love you or not. If I had told you before.. - Shut up! I wasn't sad about my marriage getting cancelled.. ..as much I was to see my father getting humiliated. I will never forgive my father's culprit. I admit I am your culprit. But my love is true, Divya. Doesn't suit you to lecture on truth. Don't ever show me your face again. Divya. Divya, please. Hey.. Somebody is following us. Drive faster. - Yes, sir. Come on. Kill him and come fast. Okay, yeah. Yeah! Mambo, let's go. Police might come at any moment. Come fast, Mambo. Oh, God! This locket, with the symbol of the sun-shield. It's no ordinary locket. According to Hojo's belief, this locket will stay with.. ..whoever takes the responsibility to protect Jua. The Hojo tribe also believes.. ..that Jua will get this locket to that person somehow.. ..who he wants to protect the entire world as well. This locket which was with Bodo first.. ..ends up with Akhil under mysterious circumstances. Hey.. Only daughter of a millionaire father. What did you think? You will marry her and become rich instantly? Where is my daughter? - I don't know? Some Africans abducted her. Africans? - Yes. Some guy called Mambo. Mambo? - Yes. Is that the guy? That's him. How do you have his picture? Do you know him? Shut up. Sir. - Mambo. Did you abduct some Indian girl? Yes, there's a girl. Budo told him where Jua is before he died. I asked her, but she didn't say. Hey, she is my daughter. - What? Don't harm her. I will get that secret from her. Oh, I get it. So you want the Jua for yourself. That's why you used your daughter. No-no, that's not true. It's true. That's why your daughter got to Budo before me. Now I won't deal with you. I will talk to Katrochi regarding the deal. If you try to save your daughter, she will die. But I will bury you alive too. Now just don't disturb me. Mambo.. - Go to hell, you fool. Hello. Hello. Hello. Where did they Divya? Why did they kidnap her? Tell me, or else.. Fine, I'll tell you. This is all because of that Jua. Jua is a sun-shield that can save the earth from getting destroyed. Katrochi gave me the contract of finding it. And I hired a cynical.. ..crazy, retired army officer..Mambo. First Mambo attacked a tribe called Hojo. Because they had Jua. But a boy called Budo managed to escape with the Jua. Later Budo hid Jua somewhere. I don't know why? And before dying he told my daughter about it. And I know..this is why he kidnapped my daughter. Let's go to the police now. If I complain, he will kill my daughter. You forgot all about humanity for your greed. She is paying for your crimes. If anything happens to her, I won't spare anyone. Not even you. Hey.. Taxi, sir. Taxi. - Kangolia. Kangolia, no. Kangolia. - No. Kangolia. - No. You.. - No Kangolia. Oh God, they are even scared of the place. I guess they will wet their pants if they hear about Mambo. I say we should leave too. Shut up, coward. Beyond fear there's Divya. I won't go back without her. She isn't waiting for you at some coffee shop. She is Kangolia. How can I leave her in such a dangerous place? Do you want to die? - Excuse me. Are you two Indians? Do we look like Chinese? We're speaking Hindi, so we're Indians. Don't get angry, son. I need to use the restroom. Will you hold this please? - This is not a locker. Enough.. give it to me. Lord Jesus will protect you. Are you inclined to help everyone? If you were Edison's friend.. ..you would've stopped him from inventing the bulb. I say let's go. - Excuse me. Are you Father Douglas? - Yes. Whose Father? Yes, that's him. How did you recognize? - It is very simple. If you have a sthetescope around your neck, you're a doctor. White coat and bible in hand, then Father. Right? - You're right. And you are? - I am Johnson and Johnson. Two in one. - Father Mechanical sent me for you. I believe in Krishna and Christian. - Come. Stop. Why choose Africa to pray? Sins have increased considerably here.. ..and even the people have become black. You're right. You must reform these people. - Yes, let's go. Hold on..not so fast. Father, shall we begin? - Bless you. 'God, I need your help to save my love.' 'Forgive me if this is wrong, and help me.' Father. This is a new place, so you're worried. I will solve your problems. You will be in trouble when you find out. Who is this fool? - He is my assistant, Mathew Chhada. His tongue is sharper than a tailor's scissor. I hope he doesn't cut something else. Mr. Johnson and Johnson. Why are there two Johnsons in your name? What's the reason? - My mother wanted twins. But I was born alone. So she added an extra Johnson to my name. What if she wanted triplets? You can ask my mother when you die and go to heaven. Father..shut him up. Which church will you go to first? - The Kangolia jungle church. Why did you stop suddenly? That's not a church, it's a graveyard. People go straight to heaven without even praying. They drink cold blood instead of cold drinks. That's why I'm going there. To teach those cannibal a lesson in mercy. Doesn't matter what you teach them? If everyone thinks like that, then who will change the world? But only if we stay alive. - Stop arguing and drive. Or else I will curse you. I don't know the route. All routes lead to God, you just drive. Why are you taking me to God so soon? - Johnson. Okay, I will drop you there and get out. Is that okay? - Just fine. Let's go first. - Okay. Where did they go? Father, you're sitting next to me, so why call me? Tell me directly. There's a virus in my phone. Whenever you get a call from my phone, just disconnect it. Okay. I get it. Oh Jesus. Father. I've a doubt. Can I ask? - Ask. Is celebrating Christmas on 25th December recent.. ..or was it done before Jesus' birth as well. That question can only be answered in some church. What church? We'll open a new charge in Kangolia and then tell you. Hey, stop laughing. Look there. Come on. Come on, run-run. Come on. Fast.. - Run. Run. Come on. - Come on. Come on, run.. Come on. Come on. Are these kids selling toy guns, Johnson? They are real guns? They are the local dacoits. - Dacoits. Junior. I warned you. - Come on. Get out of the car. - Father, save these kids. Let's pray. - Pray? Yes..with these kids. - Okay. Kids, don't point the gun at him. He's Father. Father? Whose father? You, me..all of us. Father, start praying. Children, kneel down. Sit on your knees. Stop..how many bullets are you going to fire in the sky. Father, they seem like the devil's kids. What now, Father? I don't think prayers will have any effect on them. Let's give them everything. - Me too.. You can give your life, if you want to. Give me..give me. Give me. - Otherwise I will kill you. Give me all.. Give me that. Let's go.. Ok! What happened? Are you shocked? Such stupid illiterate looters. They took my fake watch instead of this expensive car. Very smart. Johnson, sit in the car. - Ok father. Excuse me, kids. - Yes. Where can I find Mambo? - Mambo? What's for me? See that car? I'll give you that car. Car? - Yeah. If we give them the car, what about us? He's no one to me that I should worry for him. I am worried about Divya. You come with me. - Ok. Right-right. - Yes. Why break this nuisance alone? So he can show us the way to Kangolia. But you said Lord will show us the way. Children are also the angels of God. But Gods don't loot us. - It was their duty. Now you do your duty and drive. Slow..careful about car. This isn't your car. Who are you to order me? What is this, Father? I can drive any way I want. It's my car, my wish. Your car, but the fuel belongs to God. Say something I understand. I'll explain you everything later. Stop here. Come on. Come-come. With a gun in their hand, even kids can boss on us. You're so intelligent. My mother says that as well. That is the place. Who is he? - Mambo's brother Moro I am going. - Moro. One is a serpent and the other is a scorpion. Run, father. - Johnson, we're here to reform them. Stop trying to do the impossible. Killing people is their full time profession. But we must pray. Pray before death. I am still single, I don't want to die. Hey.. Father, that kid stole my car. - Let him go. He wants to play. Play? It's not a toy to play. - He might sell it. Don't say such terrible things. Shut your mouth, you. Johnson, it will be nightfall soon. You can go back if you want. - What are you saying, father? If I go back alone, the hungry animals will feast on me. Going with is us riskier? What is the risk here? We're not going to steal Mambo or Moro's cow. We're going to pray. - Wow, you're a genius. I know. I didn't know this is how we pray too. This is how I used to steal mangoes when I was a kid. And also when I made six packs. Be ready, Johnson. - Why? Are we going on a war? Answering your questions is as good as fighting a war. You fool, you would've understood if you had been like me. Who are you? He's Father. He's Brother. I am Johnson and Johnson. We came for prayer. My card is here. Father, please begin. I meant the coconut, not his head. - It was important. Prayers change according to the place. Hey.. Was father a washerman? - No, he was a fighter. Throw your guns down, or I will shoot your boss. Guns down. You? Where have you kept Divya? - Divya? Who is she? His lover. How can father be in love? - Father was a lover. You said he was a fighter. - He was both. Bring her out..or I will blow his brains out. No! don't harm him. Bring the girl. Divya. - You! I will never go with you. You're a cheater. You said lover, she's saying cheater. - He cheated for her love. Oh..did we come to reform them, or free her? Just watch quietly. What did you think? If you save me, I will forget everything. Stop it, try to understand the situation. I didn't come here for sightseeing, I came to save your life. I told you the truth. - I did..but very late. This is not the time to argue, come with me. I would rather stay here, but I won't go with you. Fine..then I will die here too. Father. You're a priest, not Godfather. Let her die if she wants to. - I came here to save her. But you came here to pray. - Johnson. Madam. Think about little me.. forsake your anger, and come along. Okay. If you say so. Get in the car. And what are you looking at? If anyone moves, I will blow his brains out. Come on. Kishore. - Yes. Get the rope. - Yes. Tie him up. Johnson, kick him. Very good. Ok! Now catch this gun. I never even held a toy gun. - Shoot now or you will die. Do you really know anything about Jua? Hey, don't talk to me. Tell me Johnson, should she be polite with me? Wrong question to the wrong man. I still didn't understand anything. You will never understand. She should understand. I risked my life for her, and she didn't even thank me. Who invited you? Those gangsters were better than liars and cheats. Madam, hold your tongue. You don't talk to the father like that. There is no father here. Idiot. What is she saying? Is she crazy? He's Father for us, but lover for her. - How's that? Six months ago this Father was crazy about her. But her father didn't like this Father. So she dumped this Father instead of her father. Now he couldn't get married and become a real father.. ..so he became a church's Father instead. Now when she got in trouble because of her father.. ..this Father saved her. I didn't understand a word. Except that he's a Father. - That's true. Madam, you rejected him but he still came to save you. This is not the way to speak. Say sorry. - Why should I apologise to him? Father, this witch has no feelings or manners. We should leave her in this jungle. Even animals won't eat her. I worked hard to get her, not leave her. Even if she keeps spitting venom. Now her venom will run through my veins. Sounds nice, but its miles away from logic. What are you staring at, you ox? You look like an orangutan. And you're trying to scare me. Hey you.. What you? I'll punch you. - I'll kill you. Father he wants to kill me in English. Don't wait..bash him. We're close to the border anyway. That's what I wanted to do, just waiting for your permission. Take that. I won't spare you. What did you say? Shame on you. I'll show you. What have you done, Johnson? Now he'll seek revenge. I am the black cobra of Gujrat. You're completely cynical. Thank God we crossed the border. "The bright face..black tresses.." Focus on your driving. It's not my fault, the mirror is so beautiful. How can mirrors be beautiful? The image in the mirror is beautiful, Johnson. When she's right next to you, why see her image? Some things are out of reach. Not everyone can get to the moon. But they can touch its moonlight. Hey..this bag has the property papers and a blank cheque. Let my daughter go. Your love for your daughter is much more valuable than the property. But what has my daughter done? That boy kidnapped my brother because of your daughter. He humiliated all of us. He already took your daughter away. But you know what's good. You will help us now. You will be my leverage now. And your daughter and that girl will come back to me. And if they don't come, without wasting time, I will shoot you. Don't drink the water here, I wonder how it is. I will definitely drink it now. Daddy. - Mambo. If you don't come back, I will shoot your father. Talk to him. - Hello, son. Daddy, why did you come here? - To get you out, dear. Father-in-law, you should've asked me before coming here. Hey..I need your permission to save my daughter. You are not calling the shots now. I am giving the orders. Who are you to interfere between father and daughter? Father and daughter are alike. I feel like taking her back to Mambo. Look, even if I die but don't bring my daughter back here. Can I make another request? - Hurry up. Don't marry my daughter. My soul won't rest in peace if I have you as my son-in-law. Hello-hello.. - I can hear you. Go on.. - Hello. Hello. It's disconnected. - Let's go. Where will you go now? It's not a tourist spot where you can go whenever you like. Couldn't your father sit at home, who told him to go prancing there? Shut up! Johnson? - Are you really going back to that dinosaur? If I don't, then he will devour her father. And what if he devours me? Don't worry, we'll be back in a jiffy. It's not a wedding where we're going for free food. I am not going back to that Mambo. - Johnson. I am Johnson, not some baby powder which you can keep using. Johnson, it's the jungle. - I know how to survive in the jungle. Don't try to scare me. I am a lion. No animal can scare me, I will teach him a lesson. I am the Tarzan of this jungle. You're back, Johnson. What about your fun in the jungle? Leaving someone in distress is a sin. I came back to help you. He's calling. How big was it? - Very big. Why hasn't he returned yet? - He shouldn't. If he doesn't come back, you're dead. - I don't care. My daughter must have crossed the border by now. Safe and sound. You.. Daddy. - Daughter. Why did you bring her back? - She forced me. She wept over the entire seat. I had to bring her back. Since when did you get so emotional? - Shut up. You locked horns with me. For a girl. You hit my brother. - No. Please let him go. Then tell me..where is that Jua? It's in the Suedo caves of Kongo Mountains. That's good. Moro. If you're lying, then I will bury you all alive. Make mine a big one. - Shut up. Moro, take care of everyone. He will make mince out of it. What if I had fallen down? - You should have. Why did you have to come back here? I see..I came here. If you had married my daughter, then.. ..this fool would've never troubled my daughter. You were making a deal with him, what about that? Don't force me. - Shut up. What deal? - No deal. Don't believe such crazy people. - I see.. Something is missing. Where is Johnson? Can I put some ointment on that? Is it okay? - Check it. Bring stronger than this. - Stronger than that? Oh, God..no, I am dead. Oh, God. I am dead. Mother.. Father! Johnson, what's wrong with you? - Oh, God! He made a hole in my back. - You broke his filter too. You fool, shut up. I hope they find the Jua, so we can get out. They won't. I lied to them. Why did you lie? If I hadn't, they would've killed him. That would've been good. That's how such fools should be punished. You fool.. See, Johnson. There's a son-in-law, father-in-law.. ..daughter, friend everyone in this story. I got involved without a reason to die. You've a role too. Uninvited guest. Won't you be welcomed too? - In a casket. I risked my life to get her, and he wants to see me dead. That's your punishment, Father. I told you don't go back. In order to reform these devils, we'll be dead. What is this? - Eat. Can I get vegetarian food? - I can't eat this. Okay. - Sir, I am vegetarian. Even snacks will do. - Just eat what you're getting. Father, will you eat this? - Yes..to my full. How else will I fight them if I don't eat? Why? Won't you fight? - Mom will scold me. Hello, did you find the Jua? - We didn't find anything here. The girl has cheated us. - S*** Hey, come on. Let's go. Get up. Come on. Search. Father, your phone is still calling me. I'll switch it off. - I guess he's still at the airport. Who? - Someone. Who cares? By the way, where are we going Father? Hey..why do you keep calling him Father? You're as old as his father. - Why are you jealous? I didn't mean someone's father, I mean a priest. Priest. When did that happen? - All because of you. You don't know. - Because of me? This father was crazy about your daughter. But since you rejected this father. Your daughter left this Father instead of her father. That's why he became a Father. When did it happen? And how can someone become father without a wife? This never happened. Not that father, I just told you he's the Church's father. Are you deaf? - Are you mad? Or you think I am a fool? Either you're mad, or you think I am one. What? What happened? - The car broke down, what else? You should check the engine before running. You should check the battery's charge. Put some water in the radiator. - Father-in-law. It needs petrol not water. You can't do a single thing properly. You should've checked the petrol before stealing the car. Stop screaming and call Mambo. Promise him anything and ask him to send a helicopter. Why will my dad call Mambo? - Oh..so you're jealous. What? Where are you taking me? Come here..come here.. - Speak up. Come here. What are your intentions? Do you want to cause a rift between father and daughter? Look, my daughter will never tolerate that I run illegal businesses. So keep your mouth shut. If you try to take advantage, I will kill you. I see.. You're scared, and trying to scare me too. Now call my father and tell him that you accept the proposal. I will never do such a thing. Divya. - Wait-wait..I'll do it. I have to do it. Hello. - Hello, papa. Yes, son. - Father-in-law wants to say something, so I called. Talk to him. Hello. - Did you call or did he make you? What do you care? That means you accept the proposal? - Why would I? Then you're not? - Divya.. Wait.. I am ready. That's better. As soon as you return from Europe, we'll become relatives. I am not in Europe right now, I am in Africa. Why? - Why do you care? I get it. You're still angry with my son. It's not anger, its hatred. Don't worry, it happens in the beginning. But then you will start liking him. - Never. That's not it, you will start liking him sooner or later. What's so special about him? - He's pure like gold. But I don't care. - I didn't mean that. I meant he has a heart of gold. He's useless. - I thought so too. Believe me, the more you know him, you will start liking him. Are you done? I am done. Now, it's your turn. Let's go. Hey stupid, come here. Me? - Yes, you. Father, you go. What? You're making a mistake. - What did I do? Getting your daughter married to a Father and tainting his religion. Sin? - Yes. He's doing a good deed. Don't bind him in worldly ties and destroy his peace. Is there any dearth of boys in this world? Spare my Father. Lecturing me on Father again. - Has to be done. Sometimes things don't look like they are. Just like you look smart, but you're not. Hey..a word more, and I will kill you. Get lost. Go. You won't change your decision? Okay. God, forgive this man. Daddy! - Coming. They were in this car. So they must be close. Go and search. Johnson, this is a new experience for me. And it's a pathetic experience for me. Really? Father, concentrate on the fish not the girl. It wasn't easy catching it, you will burn the fish. Eat all you can. - Seems like she's on a diet herself. How can we eat her? Catch one of your own size. You think I am fisherman. Why do you bark like a dog? He was right, you're completely mental. Idiot. Can you arrange for booze? Daddy. - Yes. He's staring at me. - So what? Don't look at him, and he won't look at you. It's your last night to stare. Lord. I am going to kill someone for the first time. Please cooperate with me. My daughter will be safe now. Mummy. - Daddy. Panther. - We're not Tarzan. Daddy. - Protect her, Lord. Daddy.. No.. Father. Father, are you okay? - Yes, I am okay. Uncle, are you okay? Hippopotamus shedding crocodile tears. You didn't just save my daughter, you saved me too. I couldn't have lived without her. Your papa didn't praise you enough. I don't have words to express it either. I like you, that's all I can say. Even if my daughter rejects, but..you will be my son-in-law. It's done. The bell's been tied around Father's neck. I wonder what's going to happen to this world. Whatever may it be, but we should give them some privacy now. What privacy? Father is for the public not a private property. Come. "Flower shop below..and my sweetheart's house on top." "When she looks out the window..I lose my heart." "Flower shop below..and my sweetheart's house on top." Son, scared of your father. Let it play. "Flower shop below..and my sweetheart's house on top." Lord, the solar eclipse has begun! Send one of your angels.. ..to stop the destruction of the world who can find Jua. Sir. - Mambo. I am almost there. Did you find them? Don't worry, sir. I know where they are. You come over. - Okay. I think these animals died because of the heat. Chief, some people are coming this way. 'Sanskrit shlok' 'Sanskrit shlok' Who are you? Why did you die for me? Tell me, where is Budo? - Budo who? If you don't know Budo, then how do you have his chain? Honestly, I don't know him. I don't know how this came to me. You don't know, if Jua isn't kept in this temple.. ..before the solar eclipse is over, then the world will be in destroyed. What is Jua? Some want to kill for it, and some want to die for it. I don't get it. See..the destruction has begun. The increasing heat of the sun is drying up the lakes. Birds and animals are dying. And this is just the beginning. Imagine what will happen next. As soon as the moon moves from between the earth and the sun.. ..the sun's rays should fall on Jua, or else we will all be destroyed. Now tell me where did you hide Jua? - I really don't know. I will avenge my brother's death. Please don't hit him. - Tell me. Please let him go. Tell me. Tell me. I don't know. If you don't tell me, you will be dead. It's in the Eel Pond. Eel Pond? - Yes! Budo said that Jua should never fall in wrong hands. So I kept it a secret. I was scared that.. ..papa or Akhil might reveal this secret to Mambo for saving me. Bringing Jua from there is impossible, which means we're going to die. I will kill you. - Mambo. Where is Jua? - I want it. Even if you know, it's impossible to bring it from there. I want to make it possible. Where can I find it? - Eel Pond. Mambo, let's go. Sir, no one's ever returned alive from there. That pond must be infested with man-eating piranha fishes. It's dangerous. - Dangerous? I will kill you. Kill me. I would rather die here than in that pond. Dammit. My dreams are shattered. Kill everyone. Spare no one. I will go there. Who are you? - Akhil. Sir, don't trust him. You don't have a choice other than trusting me. No, Akhil. I won't let you go there. I am not going there because I am scared of Mambo or Katrochi. I am going there for them. Budo could've told them the truth. But he gave up his life for them. A innocent boy gave up his life.. ..because he thought I am the protector of Jua. These tribesmen are risking their life to save the world. We must help them. This locket came to me was no coincidence. This is my fate. I must save this world. Sir, he killed my brother. Don't worry, Mambo. When he does our job you can kill him. Come on, my boy. - But I have a condition. You won't harm anyone. Let everyone go. Do exactly as I said. - Okay, young boy. What's happening? I can't see, sir. Throw! Throw! Throw! Throw! Don't go closer to the ridge. That pond is very dangerous. He's coming, he's coming. Bravo, come on give it to me. Wait. What are you doing? You will get it only when your men throw their weapons in this pond. What are you saying? - You want Jua or your weapons. Take the decision quickly. Throw all your weapons. Catch, boss. I got it. Hey..the world is going to end. And only I can save it. Now watch this destruction yourself. Enjoy. Father! Akhil! Damn it. Akhil! 'Regional language' 'Sanskrit shlok' 'Sanskrit shlok' 'Sanskrit shlok' Years ago, the saints from your country established it here. And now by protecting it you saved the world. Akhil, are you okay? - Yes. Johnson, why do you look upset? Because he answered the phone. - From the real Father? And he got scolded. - Sorry, Johnson. What sorry? I never called my real father so many times. I have a doubt. Did that kid take my car or did you give it to him? He wouldn't have helped me for free, so I had to give it. Have you ever seen such an exchange offer. Shut up you fool. It wasn't for free.. I worked hard for it. - Johnson, don't be delusional. Everything belongs to God. We didn't bring anything in this world, and we won't take anything back. Stop preaching, bloody liar. Fine..I'll get you a rickshaw on credit card. But I am the scapegoat in all this. Johnson, father calling. - There's no father. I don't want to talk to my own father. Special for handsome actor Akhil Akkineni. See you at another movie. Bye-bye.
