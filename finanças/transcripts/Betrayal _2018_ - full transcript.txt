See? Look at all those tadpoles. - There are so many. - Why so many? - Come this way. - Can I step on one and kill it? I don't want you to step in the water. If we step on the tadpoles they'll die. - We don't want that. - Why not? Because they want to live. - See them? - Yes. Come on. One, two, three! Come on. There are so many rocks, do you think we'll fall down? You won't fall, I'll hold you up. You think I'd let you fall? What if you slip and fall? I may fall, but I always get back up! But what if you scrape your knees? Or hurt yourself... Come on, jump. One, two, three. Listen. - Can you hear it? - What? A car was going the wrong way down the road. Just imagine, they collided head on. Who said you could put your tombstone on my mother's grave? I want you to put hers back. Now! I need to talk to her urgently. Our mother said that's our father's grave. Didn't she? You can have him if you want. We never knew him, anyway. There are nothing but sons of bitches here. It's true, ma'am. That grave belongs to them. Felix told me it was my mother's. Who knows. I killed that man myself... and watched them bury him. I even threw in some extra dirt... in case it was the Devil... or a female bandit. Tortillas, please. There you go. Drink up. Do you know where my mom is buried? I only know of the people I've killed. As far as your mom, only Mr. Felix knows. I really need to talk to her. Do you know what that's like? If you bring Mr. Felix to me... I'll find out where your mother is buried. What do you want? My dad used to live here. "My dad"! That's what they all say. Dad. I want us to go to San Francisco. I want you to tell me a story... like when I was little. President Gustavo Dúz Ordaz speaks to the nation... on this important date. Today... October 12th, 1968... I declare the opening of the Mexico Olympic Games... Which celebrate the 19th edition of the competition... in modern times. Félix! Félix! San Francisco, kid!

I thought of you like I'm thinking of you now. I took my shoes off and stood at the edge of the waves. When it seemed like I was the one who was moving... I knew I had been happy. Otherwise, what's the point of the sea coming and going... day and night? I want to be happy like you, Mom. Your momma and your daddy... went away on a trip... to bring the head..." Look what I brought you. Smell it. Yuck! Hey, what's that smell? Holy honey. Honeysuckle! Must be the time of day. What? The smell of honeysuckle. Honeysuckle!

MISELA - NEOUS STORE "THE LIGHT" Once upon a time... long, long ago... before there were streets or anything... there was a girl who liked stars so much... that she wanted to hold one in her hand. I'm going to show you the place where the star fell. There, that's it. Look for stones you can step on. Here we are. Look, look. One, two, three Ah! What a big jump. It was a big jump. That's right. Look, look at this. This is where it all begins. See? Do you like it? Watch your arm. - So, did you like it? - Yes. Remember when I woke up crying from a nightmare? Yes. And I cried, too. Because I couldn't and still can't do anything about it. I dreamed the sun tumbled down on a place like this. And because the sun tumbled down... I would never see you again, Dad. Let's go. There's a man outside! Here. Colombian. You were looking for it. How much is there? About a hundred packages. Your wife and daughter. She's very cute, by the way. Félix, my man! I like you for a Compadre. Out of uniform, Captain. Take off the shades, you look ridiculous. Alright, Mr. Félix. Did you kill my mom? No. She died a natural death when you were born. And she's buried where I told you. That's not true. A man is buried there. So, you're all grown up now. Yeah. Let me know when you get over your tantrum. You can't go. The fuck I can't. What's this? - Did you forget what I told you? - No. I didn't forget. You didn't? Shoot, then. What are you waiting for? You're still just a dumb-ass brat, Misela. You were deceived. They want you to take me where they can kill me. They've been trying to get to me for a long time. But they can't find me. Not even with the Captain on their side. They tricked you, darling. You sold me out... and didn't even realize it. That's not true. No! Never regret what you've already done. Even if it was a mistake. It's no use. What's done is done. Come on. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Fine. Good. - I brought you a present. - What is it? - Here, you want to see it? - Yes. Uuuuh - It's pretty. - It's really pretty. - Let's put it in here. - Like that. - Or like this. - Not the whole thing. - There, there. - Alright, leave it there. I'm going to teach you a game, let's play? - Yes. - Alright, sit here. And... here it is. Grab it here, put your hand there... the other hand here, and then... aim. This is how you do it. Pull the trigger hard. Pull hard. Lupita Cinema. "Lupita Cinema greets you... and invites you tonight to the atrium of the church... of this prosperous city... where you will watch... an exciting movie where you will see... no less and no more than action, excitement and shootouts. We'll be expecting you." It went something like that, I don't remember anymore. You'll need it someday. Last night I dreamed that I finally got to San Francisco. But there were no bridges that went up for ships to pass. Only sea. And on the bottom, white peaches. - I remember when I was little... - Shh. What? Hear that? No. ♪ Young Princess Flor ♪ ♪ And young Princess Isabel ♪ ♪ Use a flower to wipe their fannies ♪ ♪ Heavens, why are those princesses so cruel to plants? ♪ Mr. Félix. Ma'am. Take your glasses off. Sorry, sir. Fate is always fulfilled. - Dad, I didn't... - It's alright. The others wouldn't have dared. They're too scared of me. Fear, like love, is for poor people. And those who are loyal... can't see beyond their own nose, right Captain? Whatever you say, sir. See? Only you can see beyond, and get something out of it. But being my daughter gets in your way. Your mother's grave is just an excuse. Did you plan this? I wanted to know what you were made of. Besides, it's time to put this mess in order. To do that, there can only be one boss. Only one. Who's to say... we may even start another revolution. Who was Pancho Villa, Captain? - A cow hustler, sir. - Yeah. Let me say goodbye, Captain. Give me a hug and a kiss. Don't be chicken. Don't be afraid. Death is a simple matter. I'm ready, Captain. You can come now. Go ahead. Do what you came to do. What we agreed. It's alright, Captain. It's alright. Don't cry. Don't cry. You're a bastard, Dad. What? So are you. At your orders, ma'am. Where's my mom, Captain? Only Mr. Félix knew that. You're a bastard too. No doubt about that. May neither men nor dogs ever find his body. You can count on it, ma'am. In order for friends and enemies... to respect and fear you... you must deliver your father's head.
