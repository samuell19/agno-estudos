MAN: Hi, Dina. DINA: I saw a butterfly. Here, doggie. LINDA: That's her. DINA: I'm going to work. MITCH: She's pretty. I've been observing her for quite a while now. Music. Music! MITCH: What's her mental capacity? LINDA: I can't tell without testing her, but emotionally, she acts fairly well adjusted. What do you think? I don't know. She looks happy. We can make her happier. -(SQUEAKING) -(BOTH LAUGHING) GIRL: Claire! Let's do Gina. * Gina, Gina bo bina Banana fana fo fina -(KIDS CONTINUE SINGING) -DINA: Fina! * Gina! Let's do Susie! * Susie, Susie bo busy Banana fana fo fusy * (CONTINUE SINGING) Hey, Dina. Yes. (CHILDREN SINGING) Can you give this to that man over there? -Yes. -Okay. Popcorn? Dina! * Dina, Dina bo bina Banana fana fo fina * Fee fy mo mina DINA: Uh-oh. It's clean. (CHILDREN CONTINUE SINGING) Hi. Hello. -Hi, Dina. -Hi. Bye. MITCH: Over the entrance of the temple of science are written the words, "Ye must have faith." It's a quality the scientists cannot dispense with... (CAMERA CLICKING) ...and it is a quality upon which our current endeavor is based. Ladies and gentlemen, meet Laverne and Shirley. (CHATTERING) Their story is the result of years of scientific research. My father, Dr. Fredrick Conlon, won the Nobel prize for pioneering the molecular biological revolution back in the 1950s. Soon afterwards, he founded the Conlon Institute, which I'm happy to say remains at the cutting edge of current genetic therapy. Until his death last year, my father drove forward the groundbreaking research that we reveal here to you tonight. But first, I'd like to introduce our resident researcher, Dr. Linda Ryan. Linda came to us three years ago with Laverne and Shirley. She's been caring for them since their natural mother abandoned them and she oversees their training, their education and their medical status. In other words, she's Mom. (ALL LAUGHING AND APPLAUDING) (SHRIEKING) As you can see, they're a handful. Girls, sit down! (SHRIEKING) During routine DNA research, while testing a tropic virus meant to boost the immune system of our laboratory animals, Frederick Conlon discovered a most startling side effect. The elevation of their innate intelligence. (ALL CHATTER) That is what brings the esteemed Dr. Elisha Swan to us today. A scientist specializing in learning disabilities, he represents the Behavioral Studies Foundation in Washington D.C. Dr. Swan will guide us in the application of our finding. Looks like Dr. Swan's plane got in a little late. (ALL APPLAUDING) Based on the Institute's research to date, the FDA has given us the green light to begin testing a human subject. ALL: Doctor, Doctor... Do you expect... Doctor, isn't there a moral issue here? Yes, many. Gender selection, the right to privacy, genetically, are we creating a master race. Yes, those are very important issues. But medical benefit is our goal here. We are morally responsible to enhance the quality of life for future generations if we can. Isn't that the same... You say... You say you can make a human being smarter. Yes, that's true and possibly reverse conditions of mental deficiency. How do you address those people picketing outside who say what you're doing is immoral? We respect their right to an opinion, but wonder if they understand what we hope to accomplish here. But a human guinea pig, isn't that crossing the line? Aren't you playing God? LINDA: Absolutely. We have to play God. If that's how they choose to say it. Tell that to those people out in front of the Institute. Oh, they're always out front. We can't be concerned what other people think. We're scientists. Now, wait a minute. How we're perceived does affect our livelihood, honey. Yes, but our pledges for the fundraiser are higher than last year. And that's only half our funding. Think what we can gain from the publicity. Think of what I can gain from just being here. (LAUGHING) Hey, when are you two getting married? In six months. Right after our grant presentation. Don't worry about the grant. If this thing works, every pharmaceutical company in America will be after you. Now, don't start talking to me about drug companies. They're businessmen. They're not scientists. So all they're concerned about is their pocketbooks and their glory. That's it. Well, what's wrong with a little glory? Jonas Salk didn't call the polio vaccine the Smith vaccine. And you've heard of pasteurized milk. Louis Pasteur and his wife didn't seem to mind. Your dad was on his way to a second Nobel prize. To us. This is gonna win him that prize. ANDY: This just might win your first prize. I like prizes. Leave it for now. Come on. It's time to eat. How do you want your eggs? On my plate. -Scrambled okay? -Yes. Breakfast! I like breakfast at night. Makes twice this week. It's fun. Little too much fun. Need to go grocery shopping. Okay. No, not right now, Dina. Tomorrow. Okay. We need to make a list first. If I could buy you one special thing what would it me? -Red. -What? For my rainbow, I need red. (CHUCKLES) This place sure brings back memories. I expect your father to walk through the door any minute. To tell me how I should've handled the press conference? Your father would be proud of you. Not likely. Yes, he would. We're finishing the work he started. MITCH: We're not finished yet. He's not happy unless he's worried. So what's the plan? I want to follow the progress of one subject hands-on. You know, build 'em from the ground up. DINA: Breakfast! Here, Tuna. You be good. Okay. 8:20... This one. This one. Andy! (THUDDING) Stay! Linda is bringing Swan up to speed on her research with the chimps and how we plan to implant... DINA: And the butterfly stood on the mountain. And the butterfly had wings. Big wings. With colors. And they saw her fly. Fly high in the sky and... Hi. Hello. I know you. -GIRL: Come on, Dina. What's next? -BOY: Yeah! GIRL: Come on! And... And... It's upside down. I can't read good. The butterfly... -The butterfly landed on... -(CHUCKLES) ...a big leaf. And he... GIRL: Come on, Dina. -BOY: What happened? -DINA: ...landed next to a caterpillar... LINDA: Self recognition measures a special kind of intelligence, the sense of self. Most animals just see another animal when the look in the mirror. Laverne and Shirley know they're looking at themselves. Not only are the chimps healthy as horses, so to speak, but since taking injections, they're smart as whips. Leonard. Leonard, come here. This is Leonard Takawa. He's our senior lab technician. Graduated MIT cum laude at 18. Leonard, this is Dr. Swan. Nice to meet you, Leonard. LINDA: Would you boot up the computer game please, Leonard? We're gonna get him to talk one of these days. (LAUGHS) Who wants to show off for Dr. Swan? (SHRIEKING) LINDA: Not yet, you! (BOTH LAUGHING) -Make yourself at home, all right? -Thank you. Just don't go near Mitch's desk. It could go at any second. Computer games geared for a third or fourth grader. Laverne has it down. First thing we noticed was a rapid acceleration of their IQ. Linda's monitoring, of course. Physiologically, they're stable. Blood test consistent and normal. What's interesting is the degree to which they crave stimuli. I mean, the more the better. New puzzles, games, color, movement. They make a fuss when we leave at night. Hmm, interesting. Any other side effects? -Yes. -What? Hairy palms. Ah! (LAUGHING) Hi. (BOY CHUCKLES) Hi, dummy. -(CHUCKLES) -Can't you say hi? Hi. Oh. Your shoe. (CHUCKLES) You got paint on your shoe. It's pretty. Yeah, it's pretty messy, huh? -Yes. -(LAUGHING) Why don't you try to get some paint on the picture, uh? I do. I get paint on the picture. -Look, I got it. -(LAUGHS) (SCREAMS) Hey! Hey! Come on! Rip it up! (SCREAMS) Hey! Come on! Give it to me! Want a ride? Hop on! (BOYS LAUGHING) (GROANS) (BOTH LAUGHING) Hey, can't you read the sign? (LAUGHING) You retard! (BOYS LAUGHING) I saw her again today. She was with that group of kids who really seemed to love her. I was observing her motor skills and, uh... This logical progression of thought she uses to tell stories... We've seen abstract reasoning through her ability to express herself with her paintings. Mmm. I gotta tell you something. I... I have to admit I can't stop thinking about her. LINDA: Let's bring Swan to the park tomorrow. See what he thinks. MITCH: Okay. Let's have Swan meet her. -Hi. -MITCH: Hi. -How are you? -I'm busy. Can I have some coffee, please? Yes. And one of these cookies. How much? Andy can do change. I can't do change. Uh, that comes to $2.35. Let me introduce myself. My name is Dr. Mitch Conlon. Doctors make me take my clothes off. I'm Andy Chase. This is Dina. Would you happen to know how we can get in touch with Dina's family? I'm it. She's my aunt. And my right-hand gal. I'm a right-hand gal. She came to work for me when I bought the place. I can't read good. Perhaps we can help. This is Dr. Linda Ryan. We're with the Conlon Institute. We're involved with genetic research. Oh, so you're the guys in that big institute up the street. I've read about you. -This is Dr. Swan. -Hello. MITCH: He's a teacher. Can you make me read good? Well, maybe we can. Can you make me read signs in the grass? ANDY: Dina, please. Mr. Chase, we have every reason to believe that we can enhance Dina's mental capacity to some degree. How? With your permission, we'd like Dina to come to the institute. We'll give her a complete physical and a battery of tests to see if she qualifies for our program. If she does? She'll stay with us. We'll administer injections daily. Keep an eye out for secondary responses. -What do you mean? -Side effects. That sort of thing. Nothing that would surprise us. I like her fine just the way she is. I'm sorry. We're not interested. Mr. Chase, Dina would receive long-term medical care for her participation. And we'd put her in school. Dr. Swan... -I want to go to school. -ANDY: Dina. -I want to, Andy. -Dina, Dina, please. I want to go to school! No! -Like my friends. -Dina, be quiet! The worst that could happen, Andy, is nothing happens. She might not even qualify. MITCH: You've got nothing to lose. Dina suffers from microcephaly. Since she's had no formal education, uh, her IQ's a little difficult to pinpoint at this time. We have to completed some standardized tests. Measure her against grade school children, but I'd place it somewhere between 50 and 60. Certain parts of her cerebral cortex never fully developed, so she has a problem completing higher order activities, cognitive functions... Real people talk, please. Scholastically, she's not in the first grade yet. (BUZZER BEEPS) ANDY: What's that? That's the way we measure advances. The game targets eight-year-old abilities. Dina failed. When and if she masters it, we'll know the injections are working. We should see chemical changes within 48 hours. Blood test normal. Stats normal. She passed with flying colors. ANDY: Dina, they want me to sign this paper. They say they can make you better. But God made you the way you are. I don't know what's right. Do you even know what I'm talking about? I want to read. (KNOCK ON THE DOOR) -I brought you some things. Can I come in? -Yes. First night in new place is kind of strange, isn't it? Yes. I got a colorful picture. Might cheer up your room. I like paint. Those are flowers. -Yes, they are. -I like them. This is the computer game you tried before. I tried that game before. Tomorrow, school starts full-time. -With my friends? -No, Dina. This isn't a place to play. Learning is like work. We have rules. -But there'll be games and classes... -I like games. Good. It's time for your first injection. Well, Dina, this is our lab. This is a where we do our tests, and it's also the home to two of our favorite peoples. (CHIMP PANTING) Oh, good girl. Four seconds faster. Good. -This is Laverne. Laverne, this is Dina. -Hi. Hi. And that's Shirley. Your turn. Sit down. LINDA: Can you turn it on, Dina? The computer. (BEEPING) (VIDEO GAME CLOCK TICKING) AUTOMATED VOICE: (OVER P.A.) Your attention, please. It is now 7:45. Any personnel requiring evening security clearance, please report to the night supervisor. Attention. It is now 7:45. DR. SWAN: Maybe this isn't for her. LINDA: Her blood tests are normal. No secondary reactions. How'd she doing in class? She seems completely overwhelmed. Well, we'll give it a little time. If she can't do it, we'll have to get someone else. (DIALING) Andy, I thought you wanted to hear my voice. Andy? I'm scared. Bye. MAN: If she's scared, it won't work. It's this place. She came to work for me when I bought the snack shop. That's when she moved into my house. Now, even though I shop for her, pay her bills, she still feels independent. This must feel like a step back for her. Maybe this isn't for her. No, she really wants it. She just needs to relax. -Let me take her home. -No, that won't work. We need her in a controlled environment. But a sense of family is important for her. -She need to come home with... -With us. She'll stay with us. We can control her environment. And besides, she needs a woman's influence. If this works out, she'll be living in a whole new world. She'll have to be prepared. She needs a woman. Plain and simple. Well, here we are. Come in. Come in. -Welcome. -Welcome. I'm Dina. (LAUGHING) I'm Jeanette. Welcome home, Dina. Let me show you to your room. DINA: It's big. (CHUCKLING) Here you go, Dina. Your new home. (CHURCH BELLS CHIMING) Oh, excuse me. Well, Dina, what do you think? -Will this do? -It's pretty. (CHUCKLES) And you can do anything you want to make it home. -Here's your computer game. -Yes. -Andy! -(CHUCKLES) Thought you might need a friend. (SIGHING) -Jeannette went all out tonight, in your honor. -In my honor. Cold cucumber soup. -My own recipe. -I like cold soup. (CHUCKLES) (SPOON CLANGING) No, Dina. Dina, you have to wait. I have to wait? Yes, until everyone is served. And you have to use a soup spoon. That's the big spoon. (SPOON CLANGING) -I have a big spoon. -Good. Bread? -Would you like some bread? -Yes. (CHUCKLING) -Thank you. -Bread. (CLOCK TICKING) -(VIDEO GAME PLAYING) -DINA: Uh-oh. Oh... No. Oh... Testing session. Day 9. Dina, I want you to take a look at these pictures and tell me which one doesn't belong. DR. SWAN: Dina? Pay attention. -How many cc's? -Seven. Secondary reactions? None. There you go. Good night, Dina. Good night, Linda. Okay... -Everything all right? -I'll do better tomorrow. Good. Good night, then. Good night, then. (COMPUTER BEEPING) -I just don't get it, what are we doing wrong? -Uh-uh. Subject's last blood test and MRI show the physiological changes that we anticipated. At this point, she should be showing signs of improvement in dexterity hand-eye coordination, comprehension of tasks, etcetera. I think it must have something to do with body mass. I'm going to up the dosage again. Swan suggests we start testing another subject. We don't see improvement by Monday, he is going to contact Andy Chase. (GASPS) Aw! Andy... Come on, Tun. Shh! Shh! (SOBBING) Going home! (EXCLAIMING IN ALARM) Tuna! Aw... (MOANING) Tuna! (LINDA MOANING) (MOANING CONTINUES) (CHIMP SCREECHING) (CONTINUES SCREECHING) (COMPUTER GAME MUSIC PLAYING) (SIGHING) Ah! (CHUCKLING) Oh, my! Oh, my! Mitch! Oh, my! Mitch! I did it. Oh! Mitch? Oh! I did it. -What? -I won. -Great. -I won! I won! Good girl! -(CROWD CHATTERING) -Hold them up... Are you the people doing the testing on that woman, Dina Blake? Look, she's put you on the front page of the paper but there's no mention of -how she's doing. -Our work is going very well. Thank you very much. You call it work? How is the person doing, Doctor? How is Dina Blake? Mitch. The operation was a success, Doctor, but the patient died. LINDA: Mitch, Mitch, come on. Come on. Dina's latest results. Her IQ is testing about 30 points higher. -And her capacity to learn is improving. -Great. -You just bought this pizza for $8.35. -Yes. You gave me this ten. How much change do you get back? $8.35. $8.40. -$8.50. -Yes. Eight... Um... I'm not hungry. Dina, it's okay not to get it the first time. It happens to everybody. It's okay to try it again. MITCH: Try it again and remember, enunciate. DINA: What? MITCH: Speak clearly. I speak clearly. "At." Bat. Did I do good? Hat. Did I do it better? -(CAT MEWING) -Ca... Look. -Dina, pay attention. -I'm paying attention. -"Cat." -Don't tell me. You have to look at the word. Don't tell me. I can do it. Subject seems to have trouble focusing... I can do it! I can do it! I can do it! I can do it! DINA: I can do it! WOMAN: Dina! What was that all about? Simple. She was comfortable with failure. That's all she ever knew. What did I do wrong? You got your bedside manner from your father. You're too worried about results. Lighten up. If you have fun, she'll have fun. You don't have a temperature. I can't go to school tomorrow. I think you can. I want you to. Okay? I like it when you smile. DR. SWAN: She's come a long way in a month. LINDA: We're seeing physical improvements now. Her speech and writing are getting better. Keep her an extra hour from now on. I don't want to push her too hard. No, the injections are working. I want to see how far she'll go. (CHUCKLING) Perfect. Continue. (KEYBOARD CLACKING) I'm here. I'm ready to read. In a minute. Look at me. I'm writing a note to Dr. Swan. Look at me. He's right here. Yes, yes, I know. I know. But, uh, this is faster. You talk to machines more than you talk to people. Okay. Open the book. MITCH: Books by great authors are the best teachers in the world. They can instruct you on anything you need to know in life. The way to make reading meaningful is to find stories and books that interest you and reflect the way you're thinking and feeling. That way, they come alive and it sticks in your mind. They create mental pictures that you can hold on to. Books about history can make you a part of what's gone on before and, oh... Poetry. Poetry speaks to your soul. Connects you to another being. At the checkout counter, the clerk says, "That'll be $17, 33 cents, please." You give her a $20 bill. What change do you get back? I'll take this cookie too. Okay. The cookie is $1.35. That makes it $18.68. So I get $1 and cents. I'm right, aren't I? I made change! I made change! -I made change! -(PEOPLE CHUCKLING) I made change! "Congratulations! Today is your day. "You're off to great places. "You're off and away. "You have brains in your head. "You have feet in your shoes. "You can steer yourself any direction you choose. "You'll be on your way up. You'll be seeing great sights. "You'll join the high fliers who soar to high heights. "Wherever you fly, you'll be best of the best. "Wherever you go, you will top all the rest. "Oh, the places you'll go!" ALL: Bye! Bye, bye. DINA: Wait for me. (CHUCKLES) Looks like Dina has a crush. LINDA: Oh, that's natural. Mitch is responsible for a lot of her happiness right now. She's like a teenager. It'll pass. Don't you see what's happening? She's falling in love with you. -Andy, you're exaggerating. -No, you think you're the guy -in My Fair Lady. No, in this situation... -Hey, hey, hey. Simmer down here, you're overreacting. I'm not Professor Higgins. No, you're a doctor! She has no experience with life, you should know that. Her therapy is going very well. Dina's more important than your little experiment here. I want you to take a look at her. She's learning, she's reading, -she's happy. -She's a person. I don't want to see her getting hurt. She's fine. I'm Dina's mentor right now. She looks up to me. That's it. You should see the way you look at her, Doctor. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) WOMAN: It was wonderful. -Hi. -Hi, Dina. Hey. Mitch! Hi, Linda. -Hey, slow down. -Hey, there. -Goodbye. -(LAUGHS) Oh, she isn't maturing as fast as her mind, is she? -No, not quite. -Charming, though. Yes, it is. -Hi. -DINA: Hi. MITCH: I kinda hate to see her grow up. -We're gonna use it. -What do you mean? -We'll introduce her at the fundraiser. -Introduce her? Yes, we'll show her off. A picture's worth a thousand words, right? We've got four months. How do you do this without looking down? LINDA: Just keep your head up, don't cheat. -You'll get the hang of it. -Oh, God! (LAUGHING) Mitch, come here. We have a problem with the spelling lesson. -DINA: Let's do Leonard. -(LAUGHING) * Leonard, Leonard bo beonard Banana fana fo feonard * Fee fy fo feonard * Leonard Who's teaching what around here? DR. SWAN: We've been Dina-ised. (LAUGHS) Come on, you. Come on. We don't have time to play games right now. Hey, hey. Stop it. Calm down. Stop it. Hey! What's that all about? -Looks like you need an attitude adjustment. -(SHRIEKING) The Institute's fundraiser is to coincide with the presentation for our research branch this year. We are, at last, seeing success. Dina's progress is consistent throughout all of the academic subjects. She shows a marked interest in the arts. Probably because that's the world she has always understood. Van Gogh, Starry Night. It's one of his best works. I have to remember that. Starry Night by Mr. Gogh. The best of the Post-Impressionists. Notice the movement on the canvas. The use of color to underline the mood. How each brush stroke affects the turbulence in his tortured soul. The madness in his genius. I like it. You like it. I feel it here. Me too. LINDA: It was a very thoughtful gift, Mitch. Well, she's never had oils to work with before. She's doing so well. In so many ways. (DINA HUMMING) -(CHIMPANZEE CHATTERING) -DINA: Shirley! (CHIMPANZEE CHATTERING) -(SHRIEKING) -DINA: Laverne! Stop it. Oh. Hold it down, you three. Sorry. Come on, you two. Come on, get down. Get down. -Shirley! -(SHRIEKING) Oh! -What happened? -Shirley scratched me. -No, you were teasing her. -I didn't. No, now, listen. Now, you got them riled up. I didn't tease her. Dina, you have to admit when you're wrong. -You are not a child anymore. You are a grown woman... -I'm not... I'm not wrong. You have to start acting like one. -April 13th, subject was playing with Shirley... -Look at me. I am not Subject. I am a person and I have a name. It's Dina. (CHILDREN LAUGHING) GIRL 1: Hey, there's Dina! ALL: Dina! We missed you! I missed you too. GIRL 2: Can you play with us? GIRL 3: Yeah. Well, I... What's wrong? Nothing. Uh, nothing's wrong. You look different. I am different. You look like my mom. -(CHUCKLING) -DINA: I do? I do. So, come on, play with us. Come on. Come on, let's go! Let's do Dina. ALL: * Dina, Dina, bo bina Banana fana fo fina * Fee fy mo mina * Dina Do you know where Dina is? ANDY: No, I don't. Why don't you know where she is? (CHILDREN CHATTERING) (INHALES DEEPLY) (PANTING) Nice day, huh? I love the sunshine. Yeah. (EXHALES DEEPLY) I'm David. I'm Dina. (EXHALES) I like to jog here. Jog? Yeah, I run here every day. -(INHALES DEEPLY) -Oh! I run too, with Laverne. Oh, is she here? No, she's... She's back in her cage. (BOTH LAUGHING) I, uh... I haven't seen you around here before. I'm... I'm usually with them. DAVID: Oh, is one of them yours? No, but I'm like her mom. Are you married? No. Got a boyfriend? We had a fight. (SIGHS) Been there. That's why I'm free and easy. Sometimes, it's better. I'm free and easy too. Uh... I hope you don't mind me saying this, but you have amazing eyes. Oh. And mouth. Hey! Hey! Get away from her. -Hey! Who are you? -Get lost! Get out of here! Get out of here! -Stop it! -What did you do to her? -What's the matter with you? -MITCH: Get out of here. Hey, some education you're giving her, Doctor. -How are you going to explain this to her now? -Stop it! Stop it. Both of you. (PANTING) -David was nice. -Mmm-hmm. He made me feel good. I liked him. And... And it's natural to feel that way. But some men are gonna come on to you when you're just being friendly. What's coming on? They're gonna say nice things to you. They're... They're gonna kiss you. -I like kissing. -(CHUCKLES) That's fine. But not everybody is as nice as you are. So you have to know how to say, "No." I know how to say, "No." (SIGHS) -Mitch? -Yes? It's okay to like some people, isn't it? When you find the right person, it's okay to have all the feelings you want. When you find somebody who really cares for you, who you really trust. You save those feelings for that person. And you'll know in here. -Then it's okay? -Then it's okay. (LAUGHS) Mitch... I... Trust you. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) She really gets into things, doesn't she? Can't we just buy her the brochure? (LOUDLY) Now I know why you love it. (LAUGHING) (SIGHS) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Dina? What's this? Poetry. "Look at me "In life we sing a strange duet "The adult and the child within "And holding hands "the two have met "They know where they have been "But if they never look at sky "Sun dancing on golden beams "Then inside they'll surely die "as though they've never been "Look at me" Did you write this? It's a gift. Well, uh... I'm... I'm very proud of you. The end of World War II began with the splitting of the atom and a series of atomic explosions. -The first was July 16th, 1945 at... -Good! Shakespeare, Hamlet, Act One, Scene Three, line 78... "This above all, to thine own self be true. "And it must follow, as the night the day. "Thou canst not then be false to any man." Physics. Who was Max Planck? The Nobel Prize winning German physicist, born 1858, died 1947, who said, "Over the entrance to the temple of science "are written the words, 'Ye must have faith.'" Can you, uh, explain to me the functions of microchips? What type? Central processing chips? -ROM? RAM? What? -Wait a minute. Whoa. Where did you learn these things? -Those books. -Those books? -I read them. -Isn't she something? Where is this going to end? At the fundraiser. We won't just introduce her. We'll have her give a speech. We'll have her answer questions. She'll be the presentation. That's a lot to expect from her. -I don't think so. -I think it'd be great. You can't expect her to perform like a trained seal. DINA: Wait a minute! Isn't anyone gonna ask me? I can do it. One and two and three and four and one and two and three and... (SYMPHONY PLAYING) (SIGHS) Just Dina. -She's up again. -Mmm. (SYMPHONIC MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (CHUCKLES) Dina! It's two o'clock in the morning. Oh! I'm sorry! I... I couldn't sleep. Music... Music relaxes me. You need to get some rest. Try... Try a little warm milk. -Good night. -Good night. We were in bed, Dina. We were trying to sleep. If you're gonna be up, study. You're a little behind with your physics. I am studying. I'm teaching myself music composition. Well, study something quieter, like physics. (SCREECHING) (OBJECTS CLANKING) (OBJECTS CLATTERING) (SCREECHING) (GRUNTING EXCITEDLY) -Mitch... -Did Dina get to bed last night? -Who knows. -I don't know if she's getting enough rest -ever since we talked to her about the presentation. -Mitch... She seems so keyed up. Dina! Dina! That's all you ever talk about anymore. -Wait a minute. Wait... -You wait a minute. You better keep your eye on the ball. It's the project that's important here. -You're getting too personally involved. -What? What are talking about? We have a lot invested here. A little too much, if you ask me. What does that mean? -What's going on there, Mitch? -Going on? -Nothing's going on. -I call that classic denial. Well, I call that a cheap shot. -You're invited to a party. -What? Saturday night, eight o'clock. It's your birthday. Jeanette told me. -Can I bring Andy? -Sure. It's formal. Can you teach me how to do that? (WOMAN ANNOUNCING ON P.A.) (SIGHS) -What the hell? -Oh, my God. -(CHIMPANZEES SCREECHING) -Are you okay? -No. This... This is... Are they okay? -Yeah, I think so. (CHIMPANZEES SCREECHING) -What happened? -I don't know, vandals. Maybe teenagers? -Someone looking for drugs? -I better call security. No, uh, let me do it. You better start Dina's lessons. You don't want to worry her. -If only they could talk. -Security? This is Dr. Ryan. We've had a break in. Mmm-hmm. What's the matter with you? Are you having trouble sleeping? What are you doing in here? I was just thinking about the party, and I... I was just -pretending. -I don't care. These are my things. You didn't ask permission. Get out. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) JEANETTE: Dr. Ryan, would you like an hors d'oeuvre? Oh, no. Thank you, Jeanette. But they look delicious. -Are you all right? -Yes. I just want to be hungry. I know what's coming. All right. All right. So, I give up... So, how many scientists does it take to screw in a light bulb? (CHUCKLES) Four. One to screw in the bulb, one to write the report, and two to apply for the grant. (BOTH MEN LAUGHING) (SOFTLY) Dina. You look beautiful. Thank you, Andy. DR. SWAN: Dina, look at you! Hello. DR. SWAN: Very elegant. DINA: Andy spoiled me. MITCH: Well, you're worth it. DR. SWAN: You're 90 years old, minus a day. -(ALL LAUGHING) -MITCH: This is great! JEANETTE: Thank you, sir. The meal is wonderful, Jeanette. Well, we wanted the best -for Dr. Conlon's birthday. -Yes. DR. SWAN: Dr. Conlon is a lucky man. Very lucky. I'm going to get the birthday cake ready. All right. Interesting new report on the link between DNA and the tanning process. -MAN: Really? -Oh, what's that? LINDA: Boston University reports that a so-called healthy tan is actually strong evidence that the DNA in the skin is been severely damaged. (SCOFFS) We already knew that. Yes, but the report states that the tan is actually the result of damaged DNA. No, that's not exactly right. The tanning process is actually triggered when the body begins repairing the DNA damaged by ultraviolet radiation. -Oh, really? -Well... (SCOFFS) Actually it is a series... The repair process initiates the production of melanin and a small DNA fragment called dipyrimidine dithymidylic acid can actually cause the damage... Isn't it fascinating how our little project here has graduated from monosyllables to scientific prose. -Linda. -Linda, I only meant... LINDA: And what an education for our honored guests, who undoubtedly came from universities all over the world to study at the knee of a coffee clerk. You are way out of line. How the hell would you know. I think you owe Dina an apology. I don't think so. (SIGHS DEEPLY) Excuse me for a minute. (SOFTLY) Excuse me. What's going on, Mitch? Dina. You've gotta move back home. Now, you can go to the Institute during the day for your injections. No, Andy. I'm staying. Dina, this is not good for you. I'll be fine. How could you talk to me like that in front of our guests? It was hard not to. Hanging on her every word. I enjoyed her enthusiasm. Seeing things the way she sees them with... You're acting like a smitten school boy, not a scientist. It's ridiculous. -I'm proud of her. -Proud? I've seen you look at her in ways I've only dreamed about. I don't think you even realize it. I am looking at who she is! What she is. She's just there, no strings. Pure and simple. Do you hear what you're saying? I have never, ever, ever known that before. Not with you, not with my colleagues, and certainly, certainly never with my father. -(ZIPPING) -I need some time to think. Oh, really? And you better sort things out too. What does that mean? It means I'm leaving. (SIGHS) Are you in love with her mind? Is that what it is? Anybody can be a genius. We've proven that, haven't we? Just add our formula and stir. (CLOCK CHIMING) DINA: Mitch... I... I, uh, got some milk. I... Love you. So... I know in here. (DOOR SHUTS) (WHISPERS) I love you too. -Oh! -(SHRIEKING) How did you get out? I changed the combination. (SHRIEKING) What's the matter with you two? Hey! Come here. Come here! (CONTINUES SHRIEKING) Hey! Stop it! Come here! Come on, yeah. That's a good girl. Come here. That's it, come on. That's it. Come on, yeah. Stay! -(MONKEY PANTING) -(SIGHS) You aren't sleeping. Why? (SHRIEKING) Damn, you picked a fine time to have a reaction. I have to take you off the formula. Linda. I'm sorry. Seven cc's. Reaction... "None." Leonard, if you lowered the temperature and added a 17% solution of beta-Mercaptoethanol... It's fine. Study. Or better yet, first extract the DNA with, uh, a phenol chloroform. -It's fine. (SIGHS) -You'd get a better yield. With the DNA isolation, you get less digestion. Dina. I've done this 1,000 times. DINA: I just read it yesterday in volume 11, page 139. -Let me do my job. -One second. Never mind. I'm finished. It's late. I'm going home. You should too. I can't. I have some studying to do. Get some rest. Here it is. Leonard! TEACHER: (ON TAPE) Where is the library? (SPEAKING FRENCH) (SPEAKING FRENCH) TEACHER: The library is there. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Come on, come on. (SPEAKING FRENCH) -Are you going there now? -(SPEAKING FRENCH) (SPEAKING FRENCH) -Yes, I have to look for a book. -DINA: Oui. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Come on. (SIGHS) (SPEAKING FRENCH) Merde. (TAPE REWINDING) (VOICE DISTORTING) (SIGHS) Damn. (MONKEY VOCALIZING SOFTLY) MAN: (CHANTING) What's at stake? Join us. What's at stake? What's at stake? -Come on, join us. -ALL: What's at stake? What's at stake? What's at stake? Dina Blake. What's at stake? Dina Blake. What's at stake? Dina Blake. What's at stake? Dina Blake. You look tired. Can't stop studying. You should slow down a little. Can't. Just not enough hours in the day. You need to relax. Don't have the time. The fundraiser's coming up. What fundraiser? I have to make a speech and raise money. No, they've got you on a treadmill. No, they need me. You're proof their experiment worked. They're using you. No, they're not. I have to be prepared. That's all. ALL: Dina! Dina! Dina! Come see our dance! -I really don't... -We copied it off a music video. -Not right now, all right? -Can we show you? No! I'm talking to Andy. Sorry. Let's go. Come on, guys. That's not like you. Don't lecture me. -You came here to talk. You don't want to listen? -Andy drop it. No, you can't even see it, can you? -You and Svengali, so high and mighty... -Don't criticize Mitch. They gave you a brain. You're not using it. I'm going back to the Institute. ANDY: You even know why you're doing this? DINA: I'm doing it because I love it. You're doing it because you love him! (SIGHS) I'm doing it because I'm ambitious, something you wouldn't understand. (SYMPHONY PLAYING) My, my, my. There's just no end to your talent, is there? You scared me. The Van Gogh? It's Mitch's favorite. And a heart of gold, too. You're just too good to be true. Let me give you a little word of advice. I wouldn't be wasting my time on painting if I were you. I'd be planning for my future. What does that mean? You're so naive. You think you just took the world by storm, don't you? You're only a clinical curiosity, honey. Mitch doesn't really care about you. He's created you in his own image. He's in love with himself. Just perform your little tricks at the presentation. That's all we need from you. Let Mitch show you off. Then you can go back to your little world. I thought you should see this. It's from Decauer and some of the others. They're concerned about Dina. She's edgy, she's over-tired... Ah, well, everybody's edgy. We all are before the presentation. -It's... It's normal. -No. Don't explain this away. Dina looks to you for approval, for reassurance, for her identity. She'll do anything for you. Let her leave and get on with her life. I'll talk to her. After the presentation. This isn't about winning prizes anymore. (SIGHS) LINDA: Hang in there, girls. Just for a few more days. Then the fundraiser will be over. They'll renew our grant, and Dina can go away. (MUSIC PLAYING) (SIGHS) (MONKEY SHRIEKING) MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure that I introduce to you our hosts for this evening, Dr. Mitch Conlon and Dr. Linda Ryan. (CROWD APPLAUDING) Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of the Conlon Institute, I would like to welcome you and thank you for your continuing and enthusiastic support of our work here. Mitch, why are you hiding? -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) -I want you at my side where you belong. As the annual report tells you, it has been an exciting and promising year. Mitch. Our presentation this year holds considerable significance. We've made some groundbreaking discoveries, we've pioneered some exciting new applications, but of course, we couldn't have done it alone. -(CHIMPS CHATTERING) -Linda, would you bring them out here. -(CHIMP SCREECHING) -You're next. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING) This is Laverne and Shirley. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) As members of the species evolutionarily closest to humans, they share 98% of our genes. Their contribution to our research has been invaluable. As result of our work with them, a very special person represents the Conlon Institute tonight. Good luck. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Dina Blake. -(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) -(SIGHS) Well, girls, it's past your bedtime -(CHIMPS SHRIEKING) -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) When we first met Dina, she was far from the person that we see here tonight. Her mental capacity was that of a kindergartner. We put Dina on the same formula schedule as our chimps and then we instituted the same learning regimen to see if she could achieve the same level of cognitive function. MITCH: She did, and then some. At our last evaluation, Dina's IQ was placed at 172. She's a genius. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Dina Blake. (CROWD APPLAUDING) Who would have believed it possible? Take a strand of DNA, a genetic messenger that is tissue-specific, and tell it to go to the brain, and it does. It breaks through the barrier between the brain and the blood system, something that has never been done before, by the way. These brilliant scientists who stand before you, -asking for your dollars and cents, I might add... -(CROWD LAUGHING) ...have made history. They've reached into the brain cell itself and they transformed it, and they created me. The ramifications for the future of genetic therapy are staggering. Once, I lived in a world where I couldn't express how I felt, but I did. Look. And when they found me, I knew I wanted something, but don't we all? Isn't that natural? Don't... I'm your right-hand girl. Mitch? Let me do it again, okay? Yes. It's Dina. Dina! (SOFTLY) Andy! Dina! (CROWD MURMURING) Dina. Dina. (SHOUTING) Why did Dina Blake collapse? Was their irresponsible behavior on the part of the institute? REPORTER: Was Dina's health jeopardized? -A press conference is being scheduled. No comment. What's Dina's future now? Is she gonna be all right? JEANETTE: Good day, Dr. Swan. Dr. Conlon is upstairs. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) How is she? She's sleeping. When you tread on moral grounds, you get your shoes dirty. Your father never told you that, did he? -(KNOCK ON DOOR) -(DOOR OPENING) Hey. Feel like some company? Yours. Oh. -I'm sorry. -No, no problem. I'm just glad you're okay. -I never meant... -Shh. No. I'm sorry too. I was scared. Not just for you, for me. I was afraid you wouldn't need me anymore. Oh, Andy. Oh, wait a second. What? Voila. You always liked having breakfast at night. Scrambled eggs. (CHUCKLING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yes. We had no right to put so much pressure on you. Things have happened that I didn't expect, reactions we couldn't have predicted. Yes. For me too. Mitch, kiss me. Please. Please. I need to get some air. (EXHALING) Well, I guess we owe you an apology too. Here. What's wrong? Are you not hungry? Huh? (CHUCKLES) What's wrong with you guys? "Two cc's placebo. No formula." What the hell? What's going on here? They were having secondary reactions. I think the formula invaded the limbic system, threw off their body clocks. It's like they were burning out. Burning out? They weren't sleeping. They hated the dark. Light stimulated them. One became passive, the other aggressive. So I took them off the formula. They're in withdrawl. They'll be fine. How could you possibly keep this a secret? I kept it a secret to get us through the presentation. The presentation? What about Dina? You put her life in danger! How could you do that? I took her off the formula too. That may be why she fainted. We are talking about a human life! You're a scientist for God's sake! What about your code of ethics? Oh, I could ask you the same question. She trusted you! She trusted me! I trusted you too. "Ye must have faith." I did! In you! I thought I could have it all. The Conlon name, the recognition for our good work. That's how I saw it! I thought you did too. But you are never gonna be your father. I didn't have to be. You were. I never meant to hurt her. Linda. What about her prognosis? You'll know in six months. Where are you going? I am a scientist. When one experiment ends, I look for another. My father used to say to me, "The end is all, "no matter the cost." And this institute was built on that very precept. I never questioned it. Not until recently. My father was wrong. Science is a two-sided coin. It can be good or bad. The progress that man has made in research has unleashed an awesome power. It has given him the insight into the miracle of creation itself. The scientist must recognize the responsibility in that. He holds human life in palm of his hand. The scientist has been given the power to play God. If he chooses to play God, then he must have his conscience. DINA: Goodbye. I once stood across the street, looking back at the Institute And I realized what I had gained. And what it had cost. You created me. Now I have to find me. LINDA: I need time. Don't leave. You gave me a gift. If I stay, it would be like giving it back. Don't make me give it back. You haven't asked me what will happen to you. No. I'll be fine. No matter what. I love you. No matter what. LINDA: "And the beautiful, multi-colored butterfly broke free and flew away, "catching the sunlight in the many colors of its wings. "And the people gasped at its beauty." (CHILDREN EXCLAIMING HAPPILY) So, what does that story mean? (ALL CLAMORING) LINDA: Okay, Leanne? That there's beauty in all of us? If we look for it, there's beauty in all of us. Let's go! -(ENGINE STARTS) -(CHILDREN LAUGH) GIRL: Let's do Dina. ALL: * Dina, Dina bo bina Banana fana fo fina * Fee fy mo mina Dina * (CHILDREN LAUGHING) * Dina, Dina bo bina Banana fana fo fina * Fee fy mo mina Dina *
