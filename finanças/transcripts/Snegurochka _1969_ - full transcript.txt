This film is dedicated to the great Russian dramatist Alexander Nikolayevich Ostrovsky on the occasion of his 150th birthday. The cock crows, winter's ending. The fairy Spring has come to arouse the earth. THE SNOW MAIDEN A spring fairy tale by A.N. Ostrovsky Starring The land is still snow-bound, the glittering cold is everywhere. There is no warmth. But I like the lands of the far North. I like to arouse the powers that lie deep from their heavy slumber, and to call up from the depths of the earth their mysterious life-giving force. And I like to warm the carefree people of Tsar Berendey, that they may abandon themselves to the joys of love. Give me a kiss, to prove to everyone you're my sweetheart. His daughter is ripe for marriage. She's engaged already. Her bridegroom's coming this summer. He's a merchant from the Tsar's town. A man named Misghir. The snow in the mountains is falling, And me, a young lass, to home they're calling. Come you home, young bride, Come you home, fair maid... Sitting up over their fires and getting drunk, singing songs to the glory of Spring, dancing from one twilight to another, that's all they ever think about. Early, early the cocks crow, Of the spring for all to know. Goodbye, Shrovetide, goodbye. Goodbye, Shrovetide. Goodbye... In thick fog, at one stroke I shall freeze all the smoke. Caught by the chill it shall stand still. That's what warms my heart. You had a good time feasting, time's come to set out for the North. At the first dawn, on the wings of the breeze, I shall go to Siberia. To whose care will you entrust Snow Maiden? Our little girl is old enough to do without nursemaids. She will feel lonesome with only owls and forest genies to talk to. Girls love to have fun with friends their own age, play and frolic day and night in the spring with their boyfriends. - And what then? - Then she will find her love. That's exactly what I don't want. Every living creature in the world has to love. You're getting excited on a pretence. What you say makes no sense. Now listen to me. Open your ears and use your brain. Yesterday, from across the seas the bird-woman came. She has heard that the Sun God intends to take Snow Maiden's life. He is waiting to send his burning ray of love into her heart. That will be the end of our Snow Maiden. The Sun will sear her, will melt her, will crumble her to ashes. I don't know how, but he'll kill her. You'll believe anything that silly bird-woman says. I'm her mother. I won't let you keep Snow Maiden captive. Come on, call her now. Snow Maiden. Come, my child. Poor little Snow Maiden... Why are you so shy? Come here, darling. Let me embrace you. How would you like to live in the world, with human beings? Oh yes, I would. I'd like to. But what makes you want to leave the home of your parents? The songs of men, especially Lel's. I want to stay here, father. Night an day I could listen to that shepherd's songs that make me melt... You hear that? She'd melt. Of all the words the most frightening for Father Frost is "to melt". Snow Maiden, flee Lel like the plague, beware of his songs. He is full of burning sunshine, from head to toe. I think you're too angry with Lel and the Sun God. I really am not afraid of them, the man or the god. It makes merry for us to welcome you, It is boring for us off seeing you. How can we manage back getting you? Come back, Shrovetide. Streams from the mountains run, Fields are soaked by the sun. Get ready the plough. Carts from the shed, Beehives out of the homestead. We don't need the sleighs, We'll sing to Spring our grace... Look, here come the merry peasants. Farewell, Snow Maiden. Live in happiness, my child. Stay close to the woods, and I'll give orders for your protection. My friends, genies of the forest, take good care of Snow Maiden. All right. We'll take you so deep in the forest That you will be the sorriest. Goodbye, goodbye, Shrovetide. Goodbye, Shrovetide, goodbye. Our dear, dear Shrovetide, Our good old Shrovetide Has been here not for long, Our dear has been here not for long. We counted on seven long weeks, Our dear, seven long weeks. But the pancake time's only seven days, Seven days, dear, only seven days. Stay, Shrovetide, don't go away. Our dear Shrovetide, stay. Come home. You got no shame. I don't think I've celebrated long enough, on their money. We'll go hungry now without pancake days. You were in everyone else's house and there's no fire in your own. - There's no firewood? - It can't walk from the woods. You should have said so before. I brought my axe. I'll cut you a little birch-wood. - Look. A boyar's daughter. - What? Where? What are you talking about? You drunkard. I'll kill you. It's a miracle. Good people of Tsar Berendey. - What are you fighting about? - A boyar's daughter... A boyar's daughter? A live one? Yes, she's alive. See for yourself. Wearing little boots and mittens. If you don't mind my asking, where are you going? - And tell us your name. - Snow Maiden. Where can I go? I don't know. Take me along please. Thanks for your grace. But who will you go with? I am to become the daughter of the one who first set eyes on me. You will come with me? Why not? Am I, Bakula, not as good as a boyar? Now, folks, come in crowds to my house, with its three pillars. Come all, princes, boyars, come bring me rich gifts and bow down to me. And I'll make faces at you. You don't know your own worth. We're taking Snow Maiden. - Make way for us, folks. - Back up. Farewell, Father. Farewell, Mother. And farewell to you, deep forest. O great Berendey, may you forever rule over your happy subjects. So far all goes well in your big kingdom. I don't believe you, Bermyata. Your judgements are superficial. I've told you again and again and I repeat it once more. You must look beneath the surface and get to the bottom of things. You can't flutter about like a moth, playfully skimming over the surface of things. Superficiality is dangerous for men close to those in power. Don't think that if there are no murders or thievery... - They're thieves, for sure. - Are they caught? No sense in trying to catch them. They're bound to be caught one day. To leer secretly at people's misfortunes, to make faces from a covert place takes no great wisdom. Especially on the part of buffoons and clowns. Prosperity is a very big word. I haven't seen any for fifteen years. The Sun God Yarilo is angry with us. But why, O Tsar? There must be a reason. I've noticed that the hearts of men have grown cold. They're no longer drawn to lovely things. Now altogether different passions stir their hearts: conceit and envy, and many other things... In short, my friend, all hearts are turning hard, as cold as ice. And hence Yarilo's anger. And that explains our woes and the cold. You're absolutely right. Still I don't see what can be done. There are things you can do. Think over it, Bermyata. Year in and year out, our summer grows ever shorter, and our winters are endless. Our springs are icy and desolate. No, my friend, all is not for the best in our land. Your heart's not made of stone. You can't live without a loved one. You'll love someone one day, why not a handsome boy then? You're bracing your heart, but you can't be on guard forever. He's handsome and he promised we'd get married. He's the son of a rich merchant. His name is Misghir. - They're making fun of us. - They think we'll forget it. My father and mother are both very happy about this. He has sworn that he'd trade wreaths with me before the Tsar and make me his wife. All people talk about is how a girl can't escape love, but I've never known love. I don't even know what the word "sweetheart" means. That's something we'll never forgive. We took this girl in to be happy. We're still waiting for good luck. You believed the lies that orphans bring luck to poor people. We haven't got any richer in our old age. You frighten all men away with your stern, arrogant ways. I'm not stern or arrogant. Just quiet and modest. -Only the rich can afford to be shy. - You can't be shy when you're poor. What do you want from me, the little Snow Maiden? - You should attract the boys. - Suppose I don't like them? You've got to entice a boy, so he'll want to be with you. - To bring gifts to your mother. - To fill your father with beer. We'll be celebrating every day, that's the life. If it's true that no girl can escape from love, wait and see, it'll happen sooner or later. What a girl... We just have to fill our purse. The headdress I'm going to order. Where are we going to lodge him? It's our turn to put him up. - I can do without him. - I certainly can too. You refuse to take in your shepherd as if he had the plague. Try your bowing and scraping on others. We know you too well. Keep things you don't want to lose. Go stay at Bobil's. The community has freed me of all the task service because I'm a poor orphan. You haven't any tasks, so put him up. We'll feed him. And putting him up won't cost you a thing. Let me tell you something. It's a big risk for us to let Lel in. The matchmaker's working for his daughter. - What about you? - His wife is young and beautiful. You take care of Lel from now on and we'll pay you. What's a few rubles more or less? There's cabbage in my house too. Why let the goat come to the patch? You have nothing to fear. Your Snow Maiden is not like our girls. If you bring us a bucket of beer, you're a real friend. - We'll get along, I'm sure. - We'll pay you well. You may stay, Lel. Do you order me to sing? I couldn't order you. I'd be only too happy to beg you. I don't think I'm worthy of your begging. - What can I pay you for a song? - I'm not really paid, you know. I'm kissed, that's always my reward. The girls hear your beautiful songs and pay you by simply kissing you? It's a shame they pay you so cheap. Pick a flower and give it to me. That will be enough for a song. Here's your flower. Sing for Snow Maiden, but don't waste your fine words on her. She's saving her kisses for rich men. Strawberries, wild strawberries Have grown in the wood. A poor orphaned maiden Was born for no good. Was born for no good... Strawberries, wild strawberries Have grown ripe and lush The poor orphaned maiden Has seen no care or love. Has seen no care or love... Strawberries, wild strawberries With no warmth will die. The poor orphaned maiden With no love will... Out there onto the porch, Out there onto the porch, On the latticed wooden porch, On the latticed wooden porch Out came a fair maid... That charming Lel is right. Hurry to valleys where you're loved. Find love, for you're worthy of it. Snow Maiden's heart, made of ice for all men, won't throb with love for you either. You leave us alone. Go and pay court to Snow Maiden. Don't come any closer now. You've been behaving shamelessly. If you change your old girlfriends for a new one, how can we trust you? Stop playing with us. Why don't you make up your minds? But suppose we don't get anywhere with the new girl? You expect us to weep bitter tears? We're begging your forgiveness. At least you could pity us a little. I wouldn't pity you even if you died. - It's time to forgive and forget. - It's not so easy to forget. Leave me alone, fool. - There's no way. - I feel like howling. A Gray bear flies in the sky, With his ears working as a kite And his black tail as a rudder. Something never heard. Something never seen. And a cow comes down the hill, With her feet apart, with her eyes popped out. Something never heard. Something never seen. On a tall oak tree a pig made a nest. A pig made a nest and hatched little kids. Something never heard. Something never seen. A Gray bear flies in the sky. With his ears working as a kite, And his black tail as a rudder. Something never heard. Something never seen. Snow Maiden, why are you sitting here all alone? All the boys have left you. Why weren't you nice to Lel? Lel needs laughter and kisses around him, and I'm so shy. And I'm so very lucky. Let me share my happiness with you. This morning my dear Misghir has come back to ask for my hand. The boys and girls are going to celebrate with me. We're going to make round dances in the meadows. In a maiden's room there's dark and gloom, In a maiden's room there's dark and gloom, No light in there, no joy to bloom, No light in there, no joy to bloom. Therein sits alone our orphaned girl, She is weeping, poor thing, bitterly. Don't weep, dear girl, don't cry, Don't weep, dear girl, don't cry, We're giving you away to a righteous man, We're giving you away to a righteous man. Dear fair maidens, To my youthful beauty comes an unhappy end, He is here to part me with my dear friends. Don't give me away, hide me somewhere... Lovely damsels, wouldn't you be, by any chance, hiding lovely Kupava? Our lovely Kupava is dear to us, too. You take her and you're taking the best dancer we've got. - She's also our greatest singer. - And the greatest story-teller. Lovely girls, I'm very sorry, but I need her more than you do. I have no one to keep house for me. Give us a huge ransom, we'll consider it. I'll not refuse a ruble to the damsels. Ho, lackeys. Bring my money chest. We won't give you our Kupava. First, you'll pay a ransom. Isn't that right, men? We're not letting her go for nothing. If we did they'd take all our girls. For the girls I feel only kindness, for you it's quite another matter. I'm sure a handful or two will do and there it is. It looks like Misghir thinks we're a bunch of yokels. With me, he would have watched his language. You wouldn't see me let some stranger make fun of us like that. - What would you have done? - None of your business. Hold me back, or I might do something we'd be sorry about. - If started, don't you back out. - He'll get what's coming to him. Kurilka. Start it. A big cloud came, A cloud dark and Gray, And a thunder crashed, And a lightning lashed... Hey, Misghir, the lads feel offended. - Why? - You were rude. - Are you angry too? - Did I say I was? Then get out. Send me someone brighter. - You think I'm an idiot? - You are an idiot. You wouldn't repeat it with Brussilo here. Brussilo? Where's he? I'd like to meet him. - Where are you going? - Wait. Are you Brussilo? Come a little closer. Don't listen, friend. It was just a joke. Look at our village hero. Strangers could steal us right from under their noses. A suitor came to one of your girls. He should be treated like a guest. And all we offer him is insults and quarrels. Let's sing a song for him. Vines of grapes are all in blossom, Vines of grapes are all in blossom, Forest berries grow wholesome, Forest berries grow wholesome. A grape gets juicy and neat, A grape gets juicy and neat, And a berry is ripe to eat, And a berry is ripe to eat. This grape is our Misghir dear, This grape is our Misghir dear, And the berry is Kupava dear, And the berry is Kupava dear... I'm going to make a wreath, I'm going to make a wreath, I'm going to make a wreath, To forget all ill and grief... Boys and girls all look upon me as a stranger. You too, Lel, have come along, like a bird, you'll stop to sing a moment and then you fly away again. Your trouble is that you don't love anybody. I want to hug and kiss everybody and tell them how happy I am. These are my last hours of a girl's freedom, Snow Maiden. Kupava, I'd love to come along. You come with me, Lel. We'd better hurry, my sweet. They'll catch up with us. All my girlfriends are waiting for us. I know that Snow Maiden's your friend, but the shepherd? She'll be unhappy without her Lel. Wouldn't she be happy with me? - And I? - You would take Lel. Snow Maiden, don't separate us... Kupava, dear, and you, her friend, please leave us. Your words are making me sad. I'm only a stranger to you. Snow Maiden, don't go. When the sun sinks down in the sky and vanishes beneath the horizon, can it ever turn and come back? There is no return for the sun. Nor is there for a man's love after it's gone, Kupava. - Oh, no. - How could he? Come back, dear girls. Don't hide your frightened eyes, don't let your lashes hide them. Even so I glimpse the gentle light of an imploring look. - She mustn't let him get away. - I can see that pretty headdress... Look, Father. Our poor Kupava's in tears. - She's so sad she's crying. -How could he have done that to her? I've lived a long time, I know our old customs. Our people were the favourites of the Gods and lived honestly. We gave our daughters away to men without any fear. The betrothal wreath was a pledge of their love. Our daughters couldn't be afraid of the betrayal of their betrothed. - Welcome, my lord, welcome. - Welcome to our home. Take this, old man, money on account for your daughter. And use it as you should. Don't let Lel come near her, or I'll get good and angry. You'll tell him he can't come near Bobil's house. I warned him it would be useless even to try. Go, Lel, you mustn't stay here. That's how it is. It's not my fault. - Farewell then. - Why are you crying? When the day comes that you'll cry yourself, you'll see why others cry. Don't even think of going back on your word. Mind your parents. Take advantage, you envious people, of my poor friend's sorrow. My shame will be of some use to you at least. I'll do as you like to help you get rich. Confess, scoundrel, before everyone in the village... Were you lying to Kupava when you swore you loved her? - Or did you really love her... - and then change your mind? There's no point in talking. A heart obeys no law. In the heat of love many sweet promises are made. I loved her, but today I've fallen in love with another. To think that it's a subject of Berendey who's been talking. - Nothing could be worse. - Why have you dropped Kupava? Whenever we're in love, the thing we value most is modesty. You'd put both arms around my neck and look with shining eyes. It was a shameless way of telling me that you'd trade me off for another some day. How could he... Now we're going to have all the beer we want, enough for both. Call me when you desire tenderness, and cast me out when you're weary. There'll be no complaint, only my eyes will tell you I'll be right back any time you wish. Oh, little river. Your swift waters are deep and ice cold. You shall drown my grief, and at the same time you shall drown the rebellion in my heart. Why drown your little rebel heart? Its grief will pass... My heart is dead. Tsar Berendey is the defender of all orphans. - He's a generous tsar. - Go to the Tsar, Kupava. A man can judge his own intelligence by that of others. To pass judgement on lunacy is a futile endeavour. But we've digressed from our subject far too far already. Ah, wives... You can't accuse them of having lost all attachment to their husbands, but their fidelity in marriage has waned. The time has come to decree that wives stop being unfaithful and husbands turn their attention to conjugal love. The boys will have to be deeply in love with their betrothed, and the girls will be expected to obey. - But will it do any good? - None whatsoever. - What's then the point? -That'll be our excuse before the Sun. We'll say we did decree. They didn't heed, that's their own fault. We cannot post a guard before every man's house. Beside the point, though I admit, you put it nicely. It bothered me all night, and here's what I think. All our subjects are to meet at dawn on Day of Yarilo. And every unmarried boy and girl should take part in a great rite. We shall unite them all in holy wedlock. Yarilo will heed this great sacrifice of ours. That's impossible, Your Majesty. All the boys and the girls have done lately is quarrel. But why? There's a new girl in the village called Snow Maiden. The girls fight the boys out of jealousy, the result being the battles are getting deadly. I don't believe it. Though, on second thought, you may be right. O gracious Tsar. A beautiful girl begs you to receive her. Are maidens forbidden to enter these halls? Aren't the doors open? Not so much noise, please. Thank you. O gracious Tsar. You must help me, I beg you. Is that the way to behave? He has torn my heart out. Tell us about it. I'm listening. After taking every advantage of my tender feelings, and bragging about it, he calls me shameless... I hear, my child, your sobs and grievance. Still, I confess, all this is not very clear to me, if you'll pardon my saying so. Could you tell me how this man abandoned you, and offended you? - Shall I tell you everything? - By all means, my child. May I ask you a question, glorious Tsar? Have vows lost their meaning? Does no one have a conscience? Or must we lose our trust in everyone? Lose our trust, my dear little dove? But we cannot live without trust and conscience. - So I trusted him... - Go on. I must ask you something else, O glorious Tsar. Suppose there's a man I care about. If the man's sweet and affectionate, is it wrong to love him? - You must love him, my child. - That's exactly what I did. I paid no attention to my parents, relatives or my friends. Nobody mattered except my love for this man. And he pleaded very hard with me to give my heart forever. And now I have been abandoned by this very man. I'm shameless, he says in front of everyone. My poor dear child. Your words have gone straight to my heart. So artless, guileless. I never had to persuade the girls. A smile and they came to me. I had gold to pay for their caresses. Here is some mead... Which do you like best? Raspberry flavour, ginger or aniseed? - It doesn't matter. - Choose the one you like. That poor girl's tale of woe, Bermyata. It's simply incredible. Call all our subjects here at once. May they all see the Tsar's justice. Ho, minions. Bring Misghir to the royal court. Summon the people to witness the awesome royal judgement. - Hear ye. - Faithful subjects of the Tsar. By his Majesty's order. - Gather ye at the main gates. - At the Ceremonial door. - A public trial. - Justice shall be meted. - From the ceremonial court. - Come to the royal staircase. - Come to the royal palace. - At the oakwood door. Justice shall be meted. A public trial. The accused is present. - Do you repent for your sins? - I repent. Mighty Tsar. He has got to beg her pardon on his knees. Or else chastise the low scoundrel immediately. His sin is ghastly. We cannot allow pity to stir our hearts. The man insults love, the feeling that guides our life. The finest sentiment that nature has granted us. I say shame on my silvery mane, shame. He has deceived the girl, he must marry her. Misghir, will you take Kupava as your wife? But I love another. Snow Maiden. - The man can be forced. - You can't force marriage. O mighty Tsar. I need to be loved above all. I need it badly. But how can I love? He broke my heart. I don't want him. My good people. His sin deserves capital punishment. In our land we do not kill even for sins against love. So it's up to the Gods to see that proper punishment is meted out. As for us, we will now banish Misghir, pursuant to our wishes. He shall not stay in our realm. Let him go and dwell in desert and in forest. Console your beastly heart among the beasts, Misghir. Get out of our sight, you criminal. For betraying a young girl's love in a despicable way. Now begone. I'll say nothing to absolve myself of the charge. Still, O powerful Tsar, if you'd only seen... Here comes Snow Maiden. Oh, mother, look. The lovely azure flower. It is alive. Such a beautiful flower blooms before my eyes, I can't believe it. Is it real? Or am I dreaming? You little idiot. Looking around with your mouth gaping while the great Tsar wonders what the silly girl's doing in his palace. Her love will help to make Yarilo gentler. Here is the sacrifice that we shall offer. When the Sun God rises, we shall give her to a boy who'll marry her. O generous Tsar, she doesn't know love as yet. I don't think such a thing could be. Mother Nature dispenses boundless love to all her creatures. Still, if you're right, Yarilo has good reason to be angry. Snow Maiden, the time is here. It's time to pick out a betrothed. - Whom should I pick? - Let your heart speak. My heart is silent... My subjects. Whoever among you succeeds in conquering the heart of Snow Maiden, he shall have the girl and receive a dowry from the Tsar's hand. And he shall be the guest of honour at the royal table at a banquet to honour God Yarilo. Of all the men who are the right age, I only know one who could win the heart of this girl... Lel. Shepherd, for you this is indeed a great honour. That honour must be credited to the sun. The sun rocked me to sleep as a child, and taught me to sing. Its warmth is in my ballads. And I swear that before dawn - no matter who she is to choose - Snow Maiden will be in love. Mighty Tsar, do not send me into exile yet. The fire of my love will move the pure heart of Snow Maiden. I swear in the name of the Gods above that Snow Maiden will be mine. Misghir and Lel, hearing your oath I'll rest now easily. I'll be able to hail Yarilo's dawn. I have listened to all... and judged. Rise, happy songs, over meadows and forests. Long live the land of the Tsar Berendey. Glory. Glory. These holidays are terrible for Bakula. He won't give up dancing. He's trying so hard it's going to kill him... He really is a stubborn one. Make way for the Tsar. It is heartening to see how they enjoy it. A great people never mixes work and pleasure. When they toil, they toil. When they play, they put their heart in it. I'm going to make a wreath, I'm going to make a wreath, To forget all ill and grief, To forget all ill and grief. Our field is nice and round, Our field is nice and round, It is round but very small... Yarilo's dawn is clear. It will be a cloudless day. But you must sing another song, handsome Lel. Happy am I, happy, Happy I'm today. Merry am I, merry, Merry I'm today. I have met my sweetheart, My dearest sweetheart. She went to the forest, My dearest sweetheart. She walks in the forest, Forest deep and green, Picking pretty flowers, My dearest sweetheart. My dear Lel, you have regaled my heart. You shall have a reward. Go look among the young girls and come back with one. Bring her to me for all to see her. I want her to reward the poet of love with a burning kiss. I'm grateful, Lel. I feel as though I'd drunk a tankard of strong mead. I wish you a happy Yarilo's Day, children. Snow Maiden. You're all alone? Why are you crying? - Why did you offend a poor orphan? - In what way did I offend you? You can't see why? Ask any girl who has been forsaken. It was your own fault. How many times I wept. Sincerely I loved you. Let's forget the past, my dear Lel. Take me with you to greet the sun. Wait here. I'll come back. The boys are expecting me. I haven't eaten yet. - I guess we'll have to make peace. - You're no worse than anyone else. Radushka has a boy friend, who's about to get a kiss from her. Malusha has one for Kurilka. - Isn't this the life? - Life's so short, isn't it? To be happy, all I need is a woman. I shall not let go of your hand 'ere my poor heart has told you all. Sorrow has never yet struck my heart. I had only known joy. Consider that I'm not a boy now, but a man with tears in his eyes who begs you, a young girl, to heed his prayer. Can you love me? Answer. I cannot. You frighten me with your words and tears. Please go. You're a kind man, yet you frighten little Snow Maiden. But wait. You'll have reason to be afraid. The red blush of humiliation didn't come to my cheeks for nothing. You shall pay dearly for this. If that is the love which we find among men, I don't want it... I'll never love. You'll never see another one that's like it either in tsars' crowns or on market anywhere. The only thing which equals it in value is your love, Snow Maiden. You take this priceless stone and give me your love. I have never valued my love highly, but I still wouldn't sell it. For my love, I'll accept nothing but love, though not yours, Misghir. You'll give your love, and for nothing. Drop your maiden's wreath. By the gods I've vowed before our tsar, and I'll keep my vow. Wander in your endless search for a fleeting phantom. Snow Maiden. Chase the reincarnation of the dream that lures you. And only the light of the sun will dispel your dreams. Snow Maiden. My dear Lel, gold-crested lark... I'll be grateful to you forever. The honour of poor Kupava has been saved by you. Your kiss before everyone has restored faith in me. I knew what a heart I was buying when I kissed you. My heart will belong to you for all eternity. Come with me. We shall greet golden Yarilo, the sun. I'll proudly present my loved one to the sun before all the people. Kupava, you've betrayed me. You who accused me of separating you from Misghir, you're the one who's separating me from Lel. Snow Maiden, you should listen to the burning words that Kupava uses. It's time you learned how the heart speaks when love sets it on fire. Mama. Teach love to me. Come, I implore you. Let me love like girls do. Snow Maiden, my child, what do you want? I want to love. But I don't know what words to use. My father, the Frost, and you, the Spring, have given to me not a feeling of love, but a sad feeling of envy. Love comes to all around me, alone I'm pining away. A great fear comes over me, my beauty will fade without happiness. Oh, Mama, teach love to me. Let me love like a girl. I want to love. Have you forgotten the fears of your father that love would kill you? Mama, even if I die? One instant of love is more precious than years of tears and sorrow. As you wish, my child. I'm ready to give you the power to love. There's an inexhaustible store of love forces in my wreaths of flowers. Look, my child. Isn't this beautiful work? Flowers and leaves. Iridescent colours... A single flower will awaken one of the new emotions, and all together would awaken all sentiments at once. Oh, Mama, what's happening? The forest is adorned with such a beauty. Just look at the lovely lake. The water's so inviting. The shade under the trees beckons to me. And that sky, Mama. The sky. The dawn rises like one sparkling wave after another. Farewell, dear child, until we meet again. And pray recall the wise advice of your mother. What an indescribable treasure I have now in my breast. Snow Maiden, my strength's failing. I've been looking so long for you. Are you afraid of me? Oh, no, Misghir. No, it's not fear that fills my heart. It's the charming sound of your voice and the boldness of your gaze. I can't believe I'm hearing it. How much I've longed for you, Snow Maiden. Oh, my darling, everything in the world that is of any value lives in just one word, and that word is "love". Snow Maiden, your love will rescue a man sentenced to exile. At sunrise Misghir is going to present his bride. I can't violate the behest of my dear parents. They both said that if I loved, I mustn't reveal it to Yarilo. Will you forget your childish fears? You're used to win over obedient hearts. But I'm no child. I'm both a man in love and a commander. But I will die, Misghir. Let blessings of Yarilo descend upon your union. May you live many long and happy years and may you have host of sturdy children and grandchildren. O mighty Tsar, your wish has been my command. Bless my marriage to Snow Maiden. Snow Maiden, will you with your hand also give Misghir your heart? O great Tsar, ask me time and again, and I will answer that I love him. Now rise, Yarilo. Oh, what is it? Bliss or death? This delight so sweet? This languor which has overcome me? Oh, Mother Spring, I'm grateful for this gift of love. For this voluptuous delight running through me. This fire in my eyes. This fire in my heart, my blood. I love. I melt. Farewell, my friends. You too, my betrothed, farewell. Snow Maiden's last look will be for you. It was no phantom I cherished. I could feel her heart throbbing as I held her tight. She was a woman. Snow Maiden, live. Snow Maiden's untimely tragic end and Misghir's awesome death can in no way rouse our passions. Fair justice has been done. The daughter of the Frost, cold Snow Maiden, is no longer among us. It's time to drive from our hearts the last traces of the cold and look up to the sun. I'm sure the sun will now harbour the greatest kindness for the love of the Berendeys. God Yarilo is the brightest. God Yarilo is the mightiest. God Yarilo is the fairest. Give us light. Give us warmth.
