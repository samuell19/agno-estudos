Tell me. Tell me ! Tell me about Jenny. * I've looked under chairs * I've looked under tables * I tried to find the key to 50 million fables * * They call me the seeker * I've been searchin' low and high * * I won't get to get what I'm after * * Till the day I die * I asked Bobby Dylan * I asked the Beatles * I asked Timothy Leary * But he couldn't help me either * * They call me the seeker * I've been searchin' low and high * * I won't get to get what I'm after * * Till the day I die * People tend to hate me * 'Cause I never smile * As I ransack their homes they wanna shake my hand * * Focus in on nowhere * Investigatin' miles * I'm a seeker I'm a really desperate man ** Edward Roel ? Eduardo Roel. Edward Roel ? Eduardo Roel. You're home then. My name's Wilson. Wilson ? You wrote me about my daughter. Oh, uh, yeah. Come in. Who done it then ? Huh ? Snuffed her. What are you talkin' about ? I sent you the newspaper clipping, okay ? I told you everything I know. I never said anything about anybody being snuffed. Look, there was an investigation, okay ? The car was totaled. Jenny was-- Her neck was broken, they said, on impact. So she wouldn't have felt the effects of the fire. Those streets up them hills-- Man, you got to be careful. You got to keep your eyes on the ball. 2:00 in the morning, it's dark. Your mind's a little agitated. You're driving a little too fast. Those curves don't kid around. It could have happened to anybody. I didn't know Jenny to be reckless. But she'd have a drink here and smoke a little pot. That was it. Nothing more than that. No, not my girl. Self-control, she had. It was a point of pride. Where'd she get it, this grass or whatever ? Oh, no, no, no. I am no drug dealer. What do you think ? I think you didn't get that ink in the navy doing your national service. Hey, man, I already told you, man. Corcoran. You know what that is ? State prison ! I did my time, okay ? My sister's old man ? He's in Chino doin' eight years. I go to work. I put my life together. I put all that shit behind me. Five years in the joint ! That's it ! I just got out meself, didn't I ? This bloke she was bunked up with ? Terry-- What's it ? Terry Valentine. What's he got to say for himself ? I don't know. What's he gonna say ? They had a fight ? She drove away. She was upset. A couple of weeks before Jenny died, she asked me to drive her downtown. She said she wanted to talk to her boyfriend, Valentine. I think she was looking for him. Trying to catch him with another bird ? Exactly. That's what I thought. But we didn't go to no hotel or nothin' like that. We went someplace else. Whereabouts ? Some bad place, bad people. Some guy unloading trucks. Some kind of deal going down. Now, look, I don't know, and I don't care, okay ? They could have been shipping fava beans to Eskimos. Did Jenny know ? Valentine wasn't there. So if he was involved, and she was into something, who's to say ? But I want to tell you, Jenny stood right in front of those guys, eyeballing them, checking them out. She made me feel like she was covering my ass. I can't even believe that. Really ? What'd she say ? Hang on. Can I help you ? Can't be too careful nowadays, you know ? A lot of tea leaves about. You know what I mean ? Excuse me ? Tea leaves, thieves. Terry Valentine ? Do you know him ? And who are you ? Wilson. My name's Wilson. Well, Wilson, to start, I never heard of you. Well, I'm not that well known, except around certain districts, some police nicks. Police what ? Who, me ? No, couldn't be bothered. Who the fuck are you ? And how did you get in here ? A little bird told me that you and Terry Valentine have business dealings. I don't know anybody named Terry Valentine. Don't you ? Now, you take a walk, pal, okay ? You're makin' a big mistake. Go on. Get the hell outta here. Hey ! What you been up to, pal ? What you been doing, son ? You got to buck your ideas up. Ouch ! What you been doing ? Jennifer Wilson. Jennifer Wilson. That name mean anything ? What's the deal ? Whoa ! Hold on ! Hold on ! What the hell-- Who is this guy ? Only reason you're not dead is I wanna find out who the fuck you are. Jennifer Wilson was my daughter. Who the fuck is Jennifer-- Wasn't she that chick that showed up down here ? Yeah, talked the same way as this cocksucker. Yeah. Yeah. Terry Valentine's a friend of mine. He's a personal friend. I don't talk about my friends with strangers. But that cunt daughter of yours ? She come up here stickin' her tits in my face. Who am I ? How do I know Terry ? What's the nature of our business together ? I admire Terry for a lot of things, but I gotta say he let himself get, uh, royally pussy-whipped by that fuckin' bitch. You know what I would liked to have done to her ? You know what I would liked to have done ? I bet she would have liked that, huh ? It's too bad she had to take a nosedive off that cliff. Probably dried her all up. No ! I got a gun right here ! No ! - Get him outta here. You want me to call an ambulance ? No ! I'll call Avery. Oh, man ! Get outta here ! Whoa ! You come back down here again, Pop, and we'll kill you. You understand ? This is private property. We will shoot you, fuck-o ! Do ya get it ? Fuckin' old fart come down here. Big, dangerous gun. Yeah, we're quakin'. We're quakin'. Shit. Hey, you come on back. You come on back and trespass, okay ? We look forward to it, asshole. Stupid English fuck ! Hey, what-- Hey ! Hey ! What the-- You tell him-- You tell him I'm coming ! Tell him I'm fucking coming ! Tell 'em I'm coming ? Tell "him" I'm coming. Who ? Nobody knows. * If you could only see me * I know exactly where I am * You wouldn't want to be me * Oh, I can assure you of that * I'm not the guy to run with * 'Cause I'll pull you off the line * * I'll break you and destroy you * * Given time * He's King Midas with a curse * * He's King Midas in reverse * * He's King Midas with a curse * * He's King Midas in reverse * * It's plain to see it's hopeless ** Adhara. I remember telling your parents, "If you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation." Well, I used to hate it. Now I like it. Well, it could be worse. They could have called you... Reticulum, Pleiades. God, you're beautiful. Is there anything in this world that you want or need ? Well, I wanna know why you need that scary man in your house. Gordon ? He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks. Then what good is he ? Heard of loyalty ? Yeah. I'm loyal to things that make me happy. Oh, am I a "thing" ? Well, you're certainly not a person. I'm not ? No. You're not specific enough to be a person. You're more like, um, a vibe. God, I'm glad we're having this little chat. Come here. Get out of the pool. Terry ! Look, I don't know what transpired exactly. What ? Our friends downtown. Someone took them out. Took them out ? What the fuck does that mean ? It used to mean it was similar to a gangland slaying. Well, maybe it still is. Well-- Well, who ? Well-- Blacks ? Blacks ? No, Terry, it's not their style. From what I gather, it was a lone gunman. Lone gunman ? Oh, Jesus, you sound like the 5:00 news. Why are you telling me all this shit ? I didn't want you to hear about it and then freak out. Fuck you, Jim. I don't freak out anymore. Oh. Well, it's probably nothing. That's usually what senseless mayhem comes down to, isn't it ? Bad loan, bad judgment, bad faith. These were bad people involved with worse people. Cops got a lot of leads to follow, so-- As long as nobody can connect anything to me. No one's gonna connect anything to you. That was a one-off deal. Like a moving freight train, you hopped on, you hopped off. Anything else, I would have had you walk away. You never saw those guys again, right ? Are you crazy ? They're your friends, not mine. What ? Your clients. I befriended them when you needed them. Let's put it that way. Well, the cops. I mean, you know-- Are they satisfied with this gangland shit or what ? The cops don't get satisfied. They get placated. They're talkin' to the kid who got away, the kid who called me. Well, I called them-- Scared out of his wits, this kid. All he can say is that the shooter is some crazy guy. Shooter. Jesus Christ. Yeah, he said he went nuts. He's yelling and screaming about, "Tell him I'm coming." "Tell 'em I'm coming" ? "Tell him I'm coming." Who ? Nobody knows. Oh, man, great. This is sure makin' the fuck outta my day. Come on, come on. Terry, relax, would you, please ? The goods are long gone. Money's been turned around. Middlemen are dead. This is a good thing, huh ? So don't panic, okay ? No one can link anybody to you. Jenny did. Yeah, well, Jenny could. She'd already got to ya. Terry Valentine ? Do you know him ? Valentine came into the restaurant a couple of times. The guy's a money guy. They were together how long ? Five years. Long time. There you go. Jenny must have liked him. Jenny would say, "Here's my friend Eddie." He'd shake my hand. But the guy wouldn't even see me. You know what I mean ? Jenny told me she met him at a beach, got blinded by his smile. Can you believe that ? That son of a bitch never smiled at me. I mean, Jenny and I, we were friends, but, you know, we didn't travel in the same social circles. She had her life. I had mine. How'd you two hook up then ? Jenny was in my acting class. She was 21 when she came to me. Straight from leaving you. Maybe you should talk to Elaine. That was her best friend. I do double duty as a voice coach. Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress, not with that look. She didn't write me, did she ? She didn't know what to say. I figured somebody should say something to someone, you know ? You're Jenny's father. Why did you come here ? Thought it'd be nice to have a chat with you. That's all. No. Why did you come here ? Get a few things sorted out. Been busy, have you ? How do you mean ? I heard you were, uh-- What is that adorable expression ? At Her Majesty's pleasure. It was the bars then. What was it, Wembley Stadium job ? That was it, right ? Pink Floyd concert receipts ? Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that. Security like that can't be bought. It must be more comforting than having a daughter to greet you. Hey, ain't you gonna let me in ? You can call me again. Weren't you in a soap on the box ? Three seasons. Who told you that ? Eddie ? Yeah, Eddie, yeah. He's my new china. What ? China plate, mate. Me and him. Quite a character, isn't he ? I mean, not to you, of course. To us squares in the outside world. He give me your address. I gave him yours. I guess I thought I was being loyal to Jenny, who told me she didn't have a father. Before, of course, proceeding to tell me why. Yeah, well, she was right in a way. Her mum died when she was six. After that, she was on her own. Aunts and uncles and then, well-- How are you gonna keep her down on the farm after she's seen L.A. ? They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to visit her in hospital. 'Cause we was always mates, Jenny's mum and me. I like to think they're together now, you know. Heavenly choir. And that's where you got the word ? That's where Eddie wrote you ? In prison ? Oh, no, no, I knew. I knew before Ed. Uh, what time was it supposed to have happened ? Eddie said 2:00 in the morning. That's, like, eight hours difference between here and London. That would have made it about, like, 10:00 my time. I was just goin' out in the yard. I was in the habit of savin' my newspaper till then. Stretch me legs, breath of fresh air. Bit of a read, stretch out the good part of the day as it were. And, I couldn't open the newspaper. It was like the pages was glued together. Me hands were that weak. I thought I was havin' a heart attack. Course I know I wasn't. Guy I knew come up. "Here, Wilson," he said, "you're as white as a sheet." I said, "Fuck me. I been in prison half me life, haven't I ?" But he was dead-on, because I'd felt all the blood drain out of me head. And I knew-- I knew something must have happened to Jen. She was... magic. I can't believe Jenny told you all that about me. She was always so embarrassed. Not embarrassed. Ashamed. Not ashamed. Disappointed. Do you even know who Terry Valentine is ? Some pop music producer, isn't he ? Rock and roll is what we called it. Kind of a promoter, I guess. Whatever that means. Anyway, he took the whole '60s Southern California zeitgeist and ran with it. Packaged and sold it. Made out like a bandit. What's the deal ? Hmm ? You and Terry Valentine at 20 paces ? Come on. Is that it ? I don't see why not. Are you serious ? Have you ever known me not to be ? Oh, you fuckin' guys and your dicks, man. What do you expect me to do ? Stay at home doing sweet F.A. ? You don't believe it was a car accident ? Oh, yeah ! She fell asleep at the wheel. Terry is never gonna give you that satisfaction. He is not the type. Depends, doesn't it ? On what ? What makes you so certain ? I bloody ask him. Fine ! There's the phone. You want his number ? I've got his number. Whatever you got to do, man, you better go do it. Looks like he's brought in the heavy mob. You're kidding me. Extra muscle. Bodyguards. They look a right load of wallies there. You should see 'em. Let me see. Patrolling up and down in front of the house. Let me see. All done up like fuckin' household cavalry. Those are valets, man. Valets ? What do you mean, valets ? Who does he think he is, the marquess of fuckin' Tavistock ? Valets, man, valets. They park cars. They're having a party, looks like. Are they ? Thank you. Hey, trousers, uh, keep it handy. We're not gonna be staying long. Yes, sir. Vengo ahora. Well, we a little early, huh ? Well, first in, first out. That's me. Good evening. Mind how you go. Gentlemen, what can I get ya ? Baby sham, Eduardo ? Dubonnet with a twist ? Tomato juice with Tabasco ? I'll have a Coke. You have those same posters. What ? That you have down at your office. No, they're different. Well, I like the colors. We all did. Mmm. Must have been a time, huh ? A golden moment. Have you ever dreamed about a place... you never really recalled being to before ? A place that maybe only exists in your imagination ? Someplace far away, half remembered when you wake up. When you were there, though, you knew the language. You knew your way around. That was the '60s. No, it wasn't that either. It was just '66 and early '67. That's all it was. I'm gonna have a butcher's around the house. Who you gonna butcher ? "Butcher's hook. Look." Oop. And I'm gonna try-- No, I don't like that. And some of these. Hi. Hey, Terry. How ya doin' ? Just great. How ya doin' ? Very well. Thank you. Good to see ya. Our counterfeit C.D.s are doing extraordinary well. Do I know you ? I'm very happy about that. It was supposed to be an infinity pool to go right off the edge. Definitely business affairs. Terry Valentine. Hi. Very nice to meet you. Good to see you. Shit. Hello ? Hey. No, no, it's Crestview Terrace, not Crestview Place. Yeah, well, yeah, no, there's three different ways up the hill. The best way is to take Loma Vista-- Loma Lin-- Loma Linda. Yeah. Yes. Okay. All right. Bye. Hi. How are you doing ? Good to see you. Hi. Well, you know, it's the record business. What can you say ? Oh, it's the "Hi. How are you ?" crowd ? "Hi. How are you ?" crowd, yeah. You know Jim. Of course. We know. Blimey ! Yeah, if you can afford a house like this, you buy a house like this, you know ? What are we standing on ? Trust. You know, you could see the sea out there if you could see it. Could ya ? Where you going ? Hello ? The pool's hot, too, if you want to, you know-- These are all your friends ? Unbelievable. Well, you know-- We're not gonna do this. You produced the first Christopher Cross album ? Yeah, wow, that record changed my life. Come on. What was he like ? Just a little bit. Just give me a scoop. A nugget. Basically, I just do the contracts. That's it ? Just the contracts ? Uh, well-- Hey, babe. Bring the motor 'round. Bang out front. Hey, point it downhill. As I was driving down Melrose, just taking a left on Seward, I saw this old guy locking up a car, and it was so unmarked, it was marked. I mean, it was-- You got a cellular phone ? There's a dead guy down there. Let's call the police. You got a phone ? No, I haven't. Somebody better call an ambulance. Dame las llaves. Gracias. Gracias. Uh, excuse me. Can I help you ? Uh, no, thanks. Go, go. Sir, are you okay ? Steady on, Fangio. Man, you "steady on," man ! What the fuck you do back there ? You really didn't cap the guy, did you ? - Did you ? - That would have been too easy. - Too easy ? - He's gotta know why. You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will ? Down ! Whoa ! Whoa ! What are you doing ? Whoa ! Fuck ! Fuck ! Wilson ! Wilson ! Wilson ! Wilson ! Come on, man ! Come on, come on, come on. Shit ! Wilson. Oh, boy. You should have let me do the talking. Why ? Because you're my security consultant ? What the fuck is going on ? What did you tell them ? I told them that a longtime employee flipped out. That he had drug problems and he refused counseling, which as it happens is true. And he committed suicide. One of the guests tried to stop him. Jim, how the fuck do you stop Gordon at 400 pounds ? Oh ! That was good. Good. Well, he's heavier than that now, isn't he ? Now, Jenny never told you about her dad. Her dad ? What dad ? The one that was in prison for nine years. He was released last month. Jenny's father was in prison ? For what ? Armed robbery. Again. Oh, again. Oh, God. He's a career criminal, Terry. He's on leave of absence. Get it ? Where are you going ? Don't you think I ought to find him before they do ? Oh, man, I am fucking screwed and screwed to the wall. Look, I don't suppose he entered this country under his own name. Oh, give me a fucking break. Can you do that ? Well, I would, if I came this far to kill someone. Oh, man. Okay, not even one of your guys should handle this. What do you want me to do ? Tell them ? No, I mean-- I told them I didn't know who the guy was. People come, people go. How the fuck are you gonna find him ? Terry, he's not James Bond, you know. This is some pathetic sad sack wandering around. You tell that to Gordon. What's England anyway ? Some rinky-dink country half the size of Wyoming... where the cops don't even carry guns ? This is getting all too close to me. You know something ? People close to you keep falling in the canyons. Oh, well, now, that's brilliant. Hey, relax. I have other resources. I have other resources. No one even near to me, because I am out of here. I'm gone. How do you keep getting so lucky, Terry ? I learned how to skate when I was a little boy. Well, you know, you can have a dozen interventions, but if the person doesn't want to face up to it-- I guess not. All the people in the music industry have been taken down by doing too many-- many... drugs. All right, straight rotation. No bullshit. You call your shots. You scratch on the eight, you lose. Sound good ? That's good. You let me break ? Yeah, break 'em up. - He broke last time. - What'd you say ? I said he broke last time. Let me break. So what, man ? Look at him. He loves to break. Look, he's all excited. I see that. He's excited. I don't give a shit if he likes to break. It's my break. I'm not baby-sitting this guy. I won the break. "I won the break." What the fuck is that ? Are these your quarters ? Yeah. What the fuck is this guy doin' ? What the fuck is goin' on ? Why don't you go fuck yourself ? And take Mr. Goodwrench with ya. I'd tell you to blow it out your ass, but my dick's in the way. So-- Uh-oh. Did I cross the line ? Does that mean you forfeit ? I just wanted to play the fuckin' game. Stacy ! Come over here. How's it goin', kid ? Not bad. How'd you like to kill someone for me ? Okay. Same as last time. The rest after. Where do we go ? When you find the guy you'll know. What shit is this ? I just do it. I don't organize it. I can point you in the right direction, but you've got to take it into the end zone. This bum's a hit-and-run gunman. I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge. This is unfucking professional, man. Oh ? A successful man like me has limitations. I lose touch at the street level, so I have to depend on a smart boy like you, who's a lot closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am. Fuck you, Mr. Whatever-Your-Name-Is, all right ? This is a lifestyle I embrace. That's why I'm letting you take care of this. I'm the one with appearances to maintain. But who gives a shit about you ? Not even God. Get it done. Get a tie. How much ? Five grand. Hey ! Got half in my pocket. You makin' trouble for someone ? Yep. Which kind ? The forever kind. Maybe she doesn't even know the English dude. I don't know. Avery said she was tight with the guy's daughter. That don't mean nothin'. She's nice lookin'. So what ? I don't know. I just said, "She's nice lookin'." And I said, "So what ?" You think she's any happier ? What do you mean, "any happier" ? Any happier than any other asshole in this life ? I don't know. I never met her. Why don't they make shows about people's daily lives... you'd be interested in watching, you know ? Like Sick Old Man or Skinny Little Weakling ? Big Fat Guy. Wouldn't you watch a show called Big Fat Guy ? I'd watch that fuckin' show. Extras-- Excuse me, "background artists," right ? "Hey. Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. How's it goin' ? Yeah, Hollywood's great. Still a loser." I wonder what it's like to have tits. Jesus, are you gay enough, or what ? Hello, studio city ! Fag. Look at this guy. Oh, yeah, they need that right away. What's the smartest thing that ever came out of a woman's mouth ? Einstein's cock. That little kid's kind of cute, though. You know what I mean ? She's a little young, but-- You wanna run it with me now ? Did you forget your words ? - John, I got him. Step aside, ma'am. Come with us. Wasn't half crowded in the back of that car, wasn't it ? Drug enforcement ? Narcs ? God. I don't suppose you'd prefer a steady income, hmm ? I've got a steady income. I'm on the dole. A leach on the welfare state, in addition. You don't miss a trick. Just a fiddle. They've got me down as an immigrant with five kids. Yeah. Jenny spoke fondly of her imaginary siblings. Do you even remember the last time you saw her ? I remember every time I saw her. I watched her grow up... in increments. She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy, the friendly ghost. Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine. I wasn't in the Royal Marines... or playing Iago in some world tour of Othello. * Freedom is a word I rarely use * * Without thinking Mm-hmm * * Without thinking Mm-hmm * * Of the time * Of the time * When I've been loved * She was always threatening me. Can you imagine ? "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll put the law on ya. Promise." She didn't want me to get sent down again, see ? And if she got wind that I was planning something, "I'll shop ya, Dad. I promise I'll shop ya." I can see her pickin' up the phone. "Look, Dad, I'm callin' the Old Bill right now !" It became a sort of joke between us. Only it wasn't, really. She never would've turned you in. Not in a million years. Oh, I know that. But as time went on-- well, went in ever decreasing circles-- the joke wore off. She had a feeling... about this last job-- how long I'd get banged up for. Said she wouldn't be around this time... when I got out. And... she wasn't. How are you doin', then ? All right, are ya ? Now, look, squire. You're the gov'nor here, I can see that. I'm on your manor now, so there's no need to get your knickers in a twist. Whatever this bollocks is that's goin' down between you and that slag, Valentine, it's got nothin' to do with me. I couldn't care a less. All right, mate ? Let me explain to you. When I was in prison... the second time-- Uh, no, tell a lie. Third stretch, yeah. Third. Third. There was this screw what really had it in for me, and that geezer was top of my list. Two years after I got sprung, I sees him in Holland Park. He's sittin' on a bench feeding bloody pigeons. There was no one about. I could've gone up behind him and snapped his fucking neck-- wallop-- but I left him. I could've nobbled him, but I didn't. 'Cause what I thought I wanted wasn't what I wanted. What I thought I was thinkin' about was something else. I didn't give a toss. It didn't matter, see ? This bloke on the bench wasn't worth my time. It meant "sod all" in the end. 'Cause you've got to make a choice when to do something and when to let it go. When it matters and when it don't. Bide your time. That's what prison teaches you, if nothing else. Bide your time and everything becomes clear, and you can act accordingly. There's one thing... I don't understand. The thing I don't understand is... every motherfucking word you're sayin'. Do you know what I reckon ? You and I are after the same thing but for different reasons. And what would that be ? The reasons ? Start with the "thing." I would hazard a guess that whatever you're after... involves a considerable sum of money. And that's not what lights your fire ? In the past, granted, I have been known to redistribute wealth. But, no, I'm after another kind of... satisfaction. Do you know what I mean ? You're not from around here, are ya ? You're not carrying any kind of I.D. Who, me ? I.D., no. No. When your chaps went through my pockets, there was nothing there. What's your connection to Terry Valentine ? My daughter was living with him when she died. I imagine about the same time... as whatever the deal was... that Terry Valentine grafted you out of your share of. When I say "grafted," I-- You think Terry Valentine screwed me out of some deal ? It wouldn't surprise me. I mean, he's about as straight as a dog's hind leg. What could this deal have been, I wonder, to have set in motion such an unfortunate chain of events ? Hmph. It could have been anything. A shitload of heroin imported from somewhere or other, the usual scumbags involved. But, you know, the thing about scumbags is: No matter what they do with the drugs, the harder thing to move is the money. In my line of work, the best thing to do is to follow the money, because you can't hide the money. You can only disguise it. So what do you do ? You find some rich fool to bank all the cash coming in, make it look legitimate... in exchange for skimming a percentage off the top. Maybe as much as a million dollars commission ? A rich fool who overextended himself over time, in danger of not being so rich anymore. But I can't be sure. I can't prove anything. Anything at all. What was your daughter's involvement ? That's what I wanna know. I was hopin' you might. The security guard that works for Valentine, he's the one who sent those creeps after you. I shouldn't wonder. Yeah, it must've been. He's kind of a slippery fellow, but he keeps his hands clean and Valentine's. Darn it. There go my... slippery hands again. There was an incident in downtown Los Angeles a couple of days ago... that may have spurred this... most recent... activity. But you wouldn't know anything about that, right ? Thank you. Your daughter, she had a fondness for dangerous men ? Shame about the money, though, goin' into Valentine's pocket and not yours. I don't give a shit about the money. Personally, I prefer the heroin. See, crooks move faster than the system, so if we're gonna clean up the neighborhood, we don't have time to wait for things like search warrants and trials. Procedure becomes whatever you gotta do on the day. Oh. Cheers, mate. Go with God. Yeah. * I like to dream * Yes, yes, right between my sound machine * * On a cloud of sound I drift in the night * * Any place it goes is right * Goes far, flies near to the stars away from here * * Well, you don't know * I was comin' back from, um, a motorcycle classic... in a place called Sturgis, South Dakota, and on my motorcycle on U.S. Highway 14, on just that side of Spotted Horse, I ran into a deer. I hit a deer. I had no chance. Even though the highway patrol had-- highway people had mowed the sides-- Where the culverts were, they couldn't mow. And this doe just jumped right in front of the bike ! I had a chance to say one word. It was, "Fuck !" And I hit it. I know this: If the bullet's coming my way, and I see my name on it, I won't be calling for my mother. But, man, I tell ya, I think the only reason I'm alive and telling this story now... is because of the big F.L. front end and that solid tire on my fat boy. Oh, your fat boy. Yeah. Exactly. I was wearing-- It was the fat boy. I saw the ground, and I thought, "Mmm, put it down." And I just rode the bike down into the ground. Just perfect-- You told me this story before. Did I really ? Yeah, you did. I'm sorry. But I'll hear it again if you want. Oh, you're sweet. God, you are wonderful. What's the matter ? Nothing. It must be hard to pass on this road, huh ? Oh, the freeway's faster, but it lacks a certain majesty. It's just the car behind us has been following us for a while. I sure hope so. Where is Big Sur ? Up the coast. How far ? I don't know. Uh, a few hours, I guess. Why ? That's where he's scarpered. How do you know ? A bloke told me. You shouldn't go back to your place. Not till this is settled. What's a sliding scale ? A sliding scale ? Well, a sliding scale, um-- If we were in a union, we'd all make different rates... based on the time we served. So, he's been-- That's not a sliding scale. What do you mean ? That's not a sliding scale. Well, what's a sliding scale ? A sliding scale is-- The scale is, you know-- You start off somewhere, and you move up... or you move down. That's a sliding scale. He doesn't know what a sliding scale is. - You move down ? Dogshit cues, man. I swear a branch off a tree outside is straighter than this thing. Stacy ! Go ahead, man. Break 'em up. Yeah ? I just got chewed out. You fuckin' believe that ? What does he want from us ? That's what I said. "What the fuck do you want us to do ? You didn't tell us there was gonna be all these Negroes following the guy around too." Something's on, man. What ? Let's just say I happen to know a little more about Mr. What's-His-Name Avery... than he thinks I do about him and his... operation. So, man, I got a guy on the inside. Who's that ? You know that putz, Tom, from Seattle ? I don't know him. Tom Johanssen ? Yeah, from Seattle. I sent him to Avery. What'd he say ? "What'd he say ?" He said they're taking a road trip up the coast. You know, him, Avery, a couple of guys. Well, do you think we ought to hit this English guy again ? Yeah, man, yeah. If he hasn't gotten whacked in Bucktown, we might still have our aces. I just can't fuckin' figure out who this guy is, you know ? A courier, buyer, seller ? Anyway-- Avery wants him. Those jigs wanted him. You can bet your ass there's a briefcase somewhere. A briefcase ? So what do you think is in it ? Drugs, cash, whatever. Both if we're lucky, you know. And while they're all fucking each other over, a couple of parties like us can move right in. * Like a silent ray of sunlight * * Catching in my eyes * Like a seagull * Hey, can I ask you a question ? Another one ? Yeah, like, do you have any friends, man ? Yeah. Could call them that, I suppose. Yeah, down at the boozer, Saturday night, meet the chaps. Friends and colleagues. A lot of 'em are gone. The old faces. Don't know where. Different characters nowadays. Different assumptions. You don't know where you are. The last load of friends I had, well, it turned out they weren't my friends after all. Hey, Elaine, do you ever even understand half the shit this guy's saying ? No, but I know what he means. You know, I should be in Paris or Kurdistan. No, he'd find you in Kurdistan. Why don't you try London ? He has a history of being apprehended there. You're a font of optimism. Mmm. What the hell else have your little techies come up with ? Terry, we're trying to hunt him down. I've got my foot soldiers out there. What more can I do ? And if he comes here ? And ? What if he does ? Yeah. So you don't want to tell me about this ? About being here... with the bodyguards and everything ? I don't suppose you've ever had anything like enemies. Well, I never went out for the cheerleading squad, and I never stole anyone's boyfriend that I know of. So, no, I'd like to think not. You never will. Well, come on, now. I don't want anybody limiting my possibilities. That won't happen either. This is-- This is just a precaution. I'm sorry. I-- I didn't mean to... drag you along. I-I needed you to, um-- I just don't-- You don't want to be alone ? You see ? You understand that about me already. Where is she ? Terry scattered her ashes from a boat. He buries her at a private service. Private for who ? Him ? Shit. Jenny lived at the beach when she moved here. She loved the ocean. She was from an island. Shit ! So, how big is it when Gorgeous George lands in Italy ? - You may want to cover your ears. George Clooney comes to Venice and creates a mob scene. As photographers and fans clamor-- Hey. Hmm ? Are you throwing the empty shells back in there ? Feel better ? Yeah. It's amazing here. I went out last night. We went to this, uh-- We went to this Italian restaurant, and, uh-- Check the news. Hmm ? Check the news. Hmm. Where's the remote ? I don't know. Fuck ! Where the hell is Rick ? Hmm ? Shut off all the inside lights. I'll get Adhara. And stay away from the windows. Hey ! Have you heard of knocking ? I need you to come with me. Why ? What's going on ? Please. Now. Look. You see that ? What ? That shadow. I don't see it. I thought I told you to stay away from the windows ! Come on, everybody. In here ! Terry ? Go ahead, behind the counter. Let's go ! Let's go. Behind the counter. Terry ? Let's go. Okay. What is going on here ? Uh, we think somebody's here. What ? "We think" ? We can't find Rick and-- Larry. Did somebody call the cops ? Oh, yeah. No. Why not ? - Because I'm taking care of it. - You guys are fucking nuts ! - I'm calling the cops ! - No ! - Mr. Avery. Watch my back. Son of a bitch. Fuck ! What is it ? I think Avery's down. Fuck this. Don't ! I'm a friend of Stacy's ! Fuck you, Tom. Oh ! Shit. You stay there. What ? Wh-- Where are you going ? Terry ? Jesus ! Ow ! Tell me. Tell me about Jenny ! Tell me about Jenny ! Tell me about Jenny ! I needed money. I would've given her anything she wanted, but she didn't want-- She found out about my deal ! She tried to stop me. She said she was gonna turn me in. She said she was gonna call the cops. I couldn't stop it. It already happened. It was over. She was going to call the cops. She meant it. She had the phone in her hand. She was gonna call the cops. She meant it. I couldn't stop it ! I couldn't do anything ! So-- You're English. Yeah, that's right. I can never decide what I like better, leaving home or coming back. I prefer stayin' home, me. Oh, so you are a reluctant traveler. Got called out to L.A., unexpected like. Do a job of work. No rest for the wicked. Been away a lot. Where else ? Out on an oil rig in the North Sea. Mmm. Nine years. Nine ye-- Wow. Is that legal ? Well, time off for good behavior. I shouldn't have even been there. It was these other lads what should've been there in my place. And then just when I finished me nine years-- me contract-- wallop ! I had to bugger off to the States. Well, it sounds like you need a rest. Yeah, could be. * Freedom is a word I rarely use * * Without thinking * Mm-hmm * Without thinking * Uh-huh * Of the time * Of the time * When I was loved * That was very good. Yeah ? Yeah. Gettin' better, aren't I ? You are.
