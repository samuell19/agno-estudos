I'm wondering how we got here. Maybe we weren't paying attention. Maybe we were just too naive, too into ourselves. But that's the definition of innocence, right? Not knowing what's coming, not knowing what somebody else has planned for us. Some of them didn't even know Turner Risk. We were all just dealing with our own issues. Turner was dealing with his. Some people can handle their shit, others can't. I don't think anyone could ever be friends with Turner. He was the quiet one. He just didn't fit in anywhere, and then again, he didn't really try. He should have just blended into the background, but they just wouldn't leave him alone. I guess I always felt sorry for him. I mean, he meant nothing to anyone, and I'll never understand how people can hate at nothing so much. For some reason, I still don't understand I looked after him, protected him, hoped a little of my normalness would rub off on him. But Turner and I weren't really friends in the normal sense of the word. I wanted to move forward without him around, but without me, I don't know how he'd survive. I mean he didn't have anyone else, you know? And I've always been too hung up on doing what's right. So, I let him stick around. Now, he's my roommate along with my cousin Joey. Three of us crammed in my own two-bedroom apartment somewhere between the beach and the canyon. But Turner never changed at all. In fact, he'd only gotten worse and today, I guess, it was him against the world. Fuck. Now, get up. Get up, get up, get up. I don't know why your tripping? Because it is a big deal maybe. This is real life, it's not a fucking... It's not the circus. That's the stupidest fucking thing I've ever... Oh, because I don't get the jobs, I should stop... - And what? - You use it all the time. This wouldn't even be a problem. I could've gotten myself here. What? Bullshit. Get your fuckin' bag and get out of here. Alright? - Stupid ass. - You're kidding, dude. No, I'm not kidding. That's just... You know what? Just... Just get your fuckin' surfboard and get the fuck out of here. I... I... I know that was... How the fuck am I supposed to get home? You walk home. Oh! Whatever, man. Get your board and get the fuck out of here. You Turner Risk? So... Here. No, no, no. Not at the window. Hop in. Uh, okay. Alright, let's get this over with. - What are you doing? - We're leaving. Dude! What the... What about my board, dude? Hey. Where are we going? Somewhere else. Dude, what the fuck are you doin'? Stop the car! My board is still back there, man! Ugh, fuck! Well, just stop the fucking fuck! Just let me out. Stop the car! I wouldn't do that. Listen, I don't do business at a beach. Besides, we're just going down the road. I don't give a shit where we're going. - My board cost a lot of money! - I didn't tell you to bring it, did I? This isn't the only thing I'm doing today! - Stop. - Listen, if you don't want this stuff, that's fine. Someone else will. I don't give a shit. But good luck getting it somewhere else. Alright, my board better be there. - Your board will be fine. - It better be! Or else, my brother will kick your ass. Hmm, okay. Alright, it's... We've gotten far enough. Stop! Just a little bit further. Right, come on. - Hurry up! - You're Conner Hudson's kid brother, right? Maybe. Weird response. How do you know Conner? School. He beat me up once for no reason. Alright, come on. - Dude, my board! - Just making comparisons. You two don't seem to get along well either. Look, do you have the stuff or not? In a rush? Yeah, my board is back there! So, yeah! Oh, yeah, your board. What the fuck are you doin'? Hey. You don't do this very often, do you? I was gonna ask you the same thing. Actually, you have never done it. There you go. Yeah. Dude, hurry up! Come on! Hurry up. You have the cash, right? All of it? What the fuck is this? Advil. What? You said you could get me Adderall. - You said "Advil." - I said "Adderall"! You said you take it for ADD! - You said Advil. - I said Adderall! Fuckin' shit, man. I could get fuckin' Advil from my mom. Who's gonna pick that up? You... Alright, take me back now! Take me back! Never mind, I'll fuckin' walk! Joey. Hey, Joey. Joey? Joey! Joey. Joey, hey. Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey. - What happened? - Joey. Joey. Joey. - Get up. - It's early, man. Uh, you're a winner, you're a winner, yeah. Yeah, move your leg up. - Get up! - It's too early. No, it's not. Get up! I'm gonna sit here till you do. I need you. What? Tie my tie. - Again? - Again. Oh, you should just do this by yourself. Because I don't know how. That's what you're for. - What are you doin' today? - I don't know. I'm going go to Brian's. Work on my website. You and that Brian guy. So, you got all dressed just to wake me? - That's right. - What? Here. And to celebrate. Me waking up? That and me getting a job. Can you... Oh, I got it. You got one? Nope. I... Yeah, about that. I still actually have to go into the interview. But I feel good about it. I can picture myself there, you know? Like I belong there. Mm-hm. I've taken a lot of hits lately. Yeah. I deserve this. It's my turn to win. I can feel it. Good luck with that. Thank you. Any other words of wisdom? How many do you need? On a normal day like three or four, but today maybe like five or six. Feeling vulnerable. - Be the tree. - What? Words of wisdom for you. Be the tree. You know I have no idea what you're talking about, right? No matter how strong the wind blows, the tree is always standing, so be the tree. - Who told you that? - You did, dumbass. Yeah, I did. I remember now. I say a lot deep shit like that. You know what I mean? - Is Turner in his room? - How would I know? He knows you don't like him, you know that. So why? I mean he hasn't done anything to you, has he? - Hmm, you have to admit. - He's a little weird. Yeah, but he's smart. You know and you're smart, too. So maybe you guys can figure it out. Yeah. Like I said, he's just a little weird. Hey. - So, how do I look? - You look great. Yeah, I know, but you have to look at me and tell me that. - Good? - Yeah. I know. Thank you. I'd kiss you for luck, too, but... No. - Oh, you're such a tease. - Yeah. You sure? Don't you have a job interview to go to? And don't you have a job interview to go to? Hey. Hey. Oh, are we here for the same thing? - It would seem so. - Oh. Seth. But you can call me "competition". Robbie, but you can call me "Robbie." Nice. Make me feel guilty. Oh, well don't, 'cause I have a feeling that this job is mine. Based on what? Based on my gut feeling. Your gut's feel? Interesting. Yeah, and what does your gut tell you? That your gut's wrong. - Well, I hate your gut. - I hate your gut. So, you won't mind if I ask you a few questions then? - Shoot. - Okay. How many times did they call you back? This would be my third interview. Same. Did you meet with Carol the last time? Actually, yeah, I did. She's supposed to be one of the big ones, so, um, apparently, we're both lucky. Or just good. I mean, that goes without saying, right? - I mean look at us. - Exactly. I think we're seeing some old lady today. Really? Damn! Carol was hot. You know, I don't really care who it is. I ju... I just need this job. I'm so tired of dealing with unemployment, dealing with all that bullshit. You're tryin' to psych me out, huh? It's all true. Maybe they'll have a job for both of us. Now that would be perfect. What are you doing here? You're kidding, right? Who's this guy? That's Conner Hudson. He's obviously here for the asshole position. You know, I hope they call me first, so I can fill them in on you. Robert Cruz. You wanna come with me? Everything okay? Yeah, I'm just little bit nervous, that's all. Don't be nervous, everything's going to be good. So, you two know each other? So, go ahead and take a seat, Mr. Cruz. We're just waiting on our HR lady to join us, in fact, let me go see if I can hunt her down. - Be right back. - Thank you. Hey, Brian. It took you long. - You didn't get my text? - I did. I thought we would go to your place. - Why? - Well, let's just go. I got so bored, man. You got the video games. We're staying here. Well, we wanted you to know how impressed we were with you overall. Most of our applicants don't get this far. In fact, we wanted you to know that we had over 40 applicants apply, and we narrowed it down to six, and you were one of them. So, let me ask you, if you had it to do all over again, what would you do differently? Um, well, I thought it went pretty well. I felt, uh, really comfortable with everything. Like it was a good fit. Like... Like I belonged here. That's good to know. Uh, what would you improve? Well, I... I honestly can't think of anything. Uh, I mean, I don't think I'm perfect or anything like that, uh, but... But I learn fast. I mean, if there's something I don't know that I need to know, of course. Hmm. I can see that. I'm afraid we're gonna have to pass on you. I wanna thank you for coming in, for your time and... Whoa! Wait a minute, I mean... Can... Can I ask what did I do wrong? I mean, I thought out there you said everything was gonna be good. Is everything not good in here? Didn't we tell you we were impressed with you? Well... Well, can I say something? - Can I just, you know... - Sure, sure go ahead. I... I... I'm not u... I'm not usually like this. Believe me. It's just... I... Really thought I had this. Can you just tell me why like... What... What I did wrong? What? I mean, just so I know what to fix. Well, we are looking for a leader and we just didn't find that quality in you. Well, you see, you don't know me. I mean, I have... I have my own place, I have... I pay my own rent, I... I pay my own bills. I even take care of my cousin and have a... Have a roommate. - Great. - And I have... Great. That will help you build on what we see is lacking in your character. Lacking in my character? I thought you said you were impressed. Mr. Cruz, convince me I'm wrong and I'll reconsider it. I... I just want a chance to prove myself, that's all. I... I think I'm a great leader, it's just... I just wanna be able to show you... uh, to... To show the world that... That I can make it. I can make it better, I can make a difference. Look I... I... Look I... Shit. Look, I'll... I'll do anything, okay? I... I... I just want to work. I need to work. Please. I'm sorry, Mr.... Mr. Cruz. We'll keep your application on file. If anything should come up, we'll give you a call. That's the best I can do. That's all I can do. Maybe we should be working on this right now. Brian, come on. - I can do both. - But you're not. And I'm not gonna be doing all this by myself. Well, it is a one-man job. Okay, then it's either my game site or it's our game site. And if I'm gonna do all this by myself, then... Brian... Oh, hi, Joey. I didn't know you were in here. Brian, can you come and help me. I've lost my keys again. - I'm busy, mom. - I've got an urgent meeting and I need to get going. Can you please come and help me find my keys? I've looked everywhere. - Just help me find my keys... - Brian, just go help her out. And I can get out of here. Why don't you help her, kiss ass? Brian. Come on, I need you to help me. Mom, you see me playing this game. - Just please give me a second, please. - Brian, put the game down. Put the game down. Don't have me act up in front of Joey. Put the game down now and come... - Alright, mom! - ...and help me find my keys. - Thank you very much. - What do you want? I need you to help me. Just help me find my keys. Can you do that, please? And I can... I'm 19 years old and I can keep track of my keys. - Why can't you, too? - It doesn't matter that... Oh... you know what, young man, I don't need that smart mouth of yours. I am the reason you have that game in the first place. - Alright, mom. Alright, alright. - And you should be ashamed of yourself to say something like "I'm 19 years old." - Found them. - Oh... Exactly where you leave 'em every single time. Attitude... I am... I do too much for you... - Whatever, mom. - And I'm really... And while we're on it, you make sure and take out the garbage tonight - before I get home from work. - Now, where were we? Oh, yeah. Okay, let's look at this logically. How many computers do we have? I already know where you're going with this. Good! See? We just saved ourself an entire conversation. Okay, but if we each take credit on how much we do, then I'll be getting all the credit. - Not exactly. - Yes, exactly. No, because you're gonna do everything for now and then I'm goin' take over and do everything in 30 minutes, alright? It's called "taking turns." Right. Get it? Okay, look, the question is whether or not we want to set up a block-style format or a basic web design, so I don't know what you were doing. Well, we need more of a basic web design for what we want, right? - Right. - At least, that's what I'm thinking. Right. And then the start page, you know? All black with a logo in the middle and then you have to click on it to enter the site. - I think that would look cool. - No, it wouldn't. I don't know what you're thinking. They just wanna boom, go to the site. What are you talking about? Nobody wants a fucking splash page. It's... So okay, so what I say doesn't matter? Not really. Or not to me at least. - Oh, now you're pissed? - No, I am going to piss. Whoa. Have fun in there. Make sure you wash your hand. Fuck. What the hell? How'd you get in my house? What are you doing? Whoa... No. What a hassle, huh? What? Life, in general. Yeah. You ever noticed how hassle sounds like asshole? Hassle. Asshole. Hassle. I don't know what I'm gonna do, man. I'm out of money. Shouldn't be telling you this. That's okay. It's nice to know I'm not the only failure in this car. I just really needed this job, man. So did I. I hate the job life now. 24/7 job I have now. At least, you have a job. - I don't know, I'm gonna... - May I make a suggestion? I lo... I lost my job, then I lost my girlfriend, and now I'm gonna lose my home. You see there's a lot of losing going on here. Can anybody help you out? I have a couple of roommates. Turner, a high-school acquaintance and my cousin Joey, but... They're both paying part of the rent, right? So just up their parts. Wait a minute. That didn't sound right. It's not that easy, I mean, we... We only have two bedrooms, so my cousin sleeps out on the couch and it doesn't even seem fair to make him pay as much as Turner and me. You know, Turner has been a pain in my ass for so fucking long. I actually hope he moves out. Eventually. - What about you? - What about me what? Just tryin' to balance out the bios. - I'm a loser like you. - But a privileged one. - Hey, guys. - Oh, shit. Duck. What's up, gaysians? - Got some crouching tiger hidden penis? - Oh, fuck it. - You guys suckin' each other's egg rolls? - Fuck it. What do you want, Conner? - Can't a guy say "hi"? - Are you reaching out? Is that what this is all about? Or did you get the job and just come out here to gloat? What, you didn't get the job? Obviously, you didn't either. Well, did you get it or not? - He didn't get it. - Change of subject. Hey, I forgot to tell you we're meeting at Robbie's... - What? - Hit a bar, blitz the day... - No, no, no, no, no. - ...do some drinkin' strategizing. - Whatever. - Nope. We'll either lament or celebrate. Uh, either way we'll celebrate. You in? You still live in that same apartment? For now. Yeah, yeah, okay, sure. Why not? Sure. - Cool? - He's not my favorite person. I can hear you! Then you'll suck it up. You need this. And you need friends right now, so shut up. Well, like I said, he is not my favorite person. How do you guys know each other? - School. - High school. That explains a lot. - He was a dick. - Yeah, he was a pussy. Sounds to me like you two fit together perfectly. Alright, cats. School cut. Really? - What the fuck, man? - What? I thought you were dead. Sure, I messed up on that one. You can understand how distracted I was. You can stop. You're smart, aren't you? Robbie said you're smart. Scholarships are hard to get these days. People make fun of you in school, don't they? I know somethin' about that. Who's this other guy? Just as well. This is what it's all about, you know? All this. You can care about it, but doesn't really care about you. You know just functions on its own to keep going, stays the same. Just like this. Forever. Even holds up when people fuck it up. People fuck up everything, don't they, Joey? I'd rather be the forest, if you know what I mean. You wanna say something? What? You would understand anyways. Why are you doing this? Ah, he speaks. I'm pulling weeds, metaphorically speaking. - You never liked me anyways. - I... I have a life. Yeah, we all have things to do, okay? - I... my family cares for me. My mom... I... - We all have a life. I don't know what to say. It all makes sense in the end. To you. Huh? How do we proceed from here? Help! Yeah, help! Help. No, no, please, no. Oh, God. Oh, no. No, God, please, no. Please. No. No, no. God. No, please, no. No, no. Please, help. What are you doing here? I was just gonna text you. Okay, so text me then. Can I come in? Now is not the best time. I've heard that line before. - Seriously. - I thought we broke up. - We did. - Then what do you want? - You said we'd still be friends. - No, you said that. So, can I come in? You know what? I'm really not in the mood, okay? Okay? And this Brad guy, how's he? He's not you. I miss you. - I miss us. - Stop. Shh. Fuck! You know I knew it but not today, Bree. - I do not need this today. - What happened? See, that's why I wanted to come today. I had a feeling there was something wrong. - Talk to me. - Don't touch me. Leave! You don't want me to do that. Leave! Please just leave. I'm not going. Go on. Move, move, move. Shit. - Who is that? - I don't know. Fuck! We tried. I mean, I tried. Whoever it is, I do not want them to know you're here. Why not? Why the fuck didn't you just leave when I asked you to? Why did you let me stay? How do you get me to do these things? - I didn't want to. - Yes, you obviously did! No, I did not. You... you manipulate. You get your way or else. - Fuck you. You know what your problem is? - Oh yeah, yeah. You never made me feel like I was the only one. - That's fucking bullshit. - I was your girlfriend, but everything and everyone was always more important than me. You know what you expected me to be exactly how you wanted me to be, so I was never fucking good enough for you. And you reminded me about that every fucking day! Leave, okay? What's up, man? I didn't know you were here. What's the matter? - Nothing. - What does that mean? I'm reinventing myself today. That sounds promising. I'm just, uh, changing things, but, uh, it's not easy. Well, good luck with that. Well, that's what I'm up to. I'm just not sure anymore. Hang in there, man. Are you okay? I have to go. You sure you're okay, man? Where are you headed? In the middle of cleanin' some things up right now. Tyin' up loose ends. What was that? Hey, just so you know, I'm goin' out in a bit, too. Where? Out with some friends. Uh, just some people I met at the job interview today. Which did not go well, by the way. Oh. And I... I'd invite you, but it's... It's Conner Hudson and somebody you don't know, so... I thought you didn't like Conner Hudson. - I didn't invite him. - I don't like him. And you have a better reason not to but that's why I'm not inviting you. I'm busy anyway. I'll leave you to it then, okay? We're friends, right? Yeah, of course. It's interesting how things are turning out. Anything goes. Shit happens, man. Anything else? I guess not. Okay, then. What are you doing? Get off of him! Stop! Get off of him! Get off of him. Get off! Get off! Hey! What's going on? We should call 911. Are you okay? Maybe a couple bruises, but, yeah. Well, so am I. He was trying to kill you! I agree with the hot chick, we should call the police. No, I think we should kick his ass. We're gonna call the cops. We just don't need to call them right this second. I don't have to listen to you. If the man wants a few minutes to think it through, let him think it through. I'm okay. There's little damage done. We don't need to call the fuckin' cops. So, what exactly happened? I don't know. We were talkin' one minute and the next, he just goes psycho on me. - I don't know. - Oh, God! - What... What were you talkin' about? - Nothing. Really, that's the thing is I could tell something was bugging him, but nothing that should set him off like that. What did he say? He said he was reinventing himself or some shit. Doing something he always wanted to do or something like that. I told him I was gonna go out with some friends and he wasn't invited. - Oh, there you go. - Well, fuck you, man! I didn't invite him because of you. - What does that mean? - He just... he just has trouble connecting with people. - Obviously. - So, I'm one of his only friends. Well, if he felt his only friend was leaving him out of something, it must have set him off. Well, how would I know he'd react like that? He never did anything like that before. Are we calling the cops or what? - No! - No. Look, when he said he was doing something he always wanted to do. I thought he meant he was gonna hang out with some friends or something. Where's his room? The door on the right over there. But what are you gonna do? I'm gonna go juggle. I'm gonna fuckin' look in his room. What do you think I'm gonna do? Whatever. Fuck it, man. Hey, give me back my phone. What are we lookin' for? I don't know. Something incriminating. Make sure you don't mess things up too much. What do you think I'll ruin your friendship? He might know we were here. Does it really matter at this point? It was pretty impressive the way you kicked ass back there. I'm gonna go change real quick. Do not do anything. Turner Risk has been weird since the get-go. - Fuckin' Turner Risk. - What is it? How did my brother's fuckin' key get in Tuner Risk's bedroom? - What are you talkin' about? - Tell me! Tell me how the fuck Turner Risk got this! How the fuck am I supposed to know that? Because you're his fuckin' roommate, asshole! Are you sure it's your brother's key? - Maybe... - Of course, I'm fuckin' sure it's my fucking brother's key. - Can I call the cops now? - I gave it to him this morning when I dropped him off at the beach. No? You're gonna ignore me? Fine. - No answer. - You guys are gonna ignore me? - No fuckin' answer, see? - That doesn't prove anything. I swear to God, if he touched my brother's head, I'm gonna rip his the fuck off. Dude, Turner doesn't even know your brother! Yeah, well, he knows me, man! - I know. - Shut up! And my brother, he gets around, so... Maybe it just looks like your brother's key. - Oh, yeah, does it? - I've seen lots of keys like that before. Oh, does... Does it look like my brother's... You've seen lots of keys like this? Have you? What are you the fucking key wizard? Fucking shit. No fuckin' answer! Dude, can you just calm down really? - Calm down? - Yes. - You want me to... You want me to calm down? - Yes, you're in my house. - Yeah... So, calm down. - You need to calm down, bro. It's your fault that this fuckin' psycho is on the loose. - It's my fault? Yeah, it's my fault. - Yeah. Sure, because you've been incubating him here. Him and his shit fuck ideas. The guy is mental, Robbie. Everyone knows he's been... He's been mental! Why are you the only one that doesn't fucking get it? Why do you think he would be mental, huh? There you are in high school, the great fuckin' Conner Hudson. What were you doing? Just screwing with his head every fucking day, - you and your shithead friends. - Yeah, what about you, huh? The great Robert Cruz. Always telling that he's okay when he's obviously fucking not! - I gave him direction. - I gave him the truth. - No, you made him worse. - Yeah? - You all made him worse. - Bullshit. - Fuck you, man. - Yeah, fuck me. Are you rea... You fucking kidding me. - You were the bully. - Yeah, I... You were that guy, dude. I haven't seen him in six fucking years! - You live with the guy. - That doesn't mean shit. Well, something had to have set him off. - It had to have been you! - Fuck you. You know what I think? - No, why don't you tell us... - No, no, no, no. - You haven't. - I... I think that he's out for revenge. Yeah, he's tryin' to get back at me for shit that I did ages ago. You see that... That right there I think I can understand that one. Okay. Yeah, you can... You fuckin' deserve it. - Stop! Stop it! - Don't touch me, bitch! All we know is that he attacked you... - Yeah, maybe I will. - Go ahead. We don't know anything else. I think we do know shit, alright? I think he's been fermenting here with his mental issues and now he's getting drunk off of them. - Yeah, real classy, dick. Just like in high school, right? - Yeah. How can you be defending him after what he did to you? - I mean, seriously. - Who the fuck said I'm defending him? Maybe I'm the only guy who actually understands him. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, you are not the only one. I understand him perfectly. At first, revenge was the kicker. Now, he's just whacked out. - You don't know that. - I don't give a shit. I'm finding my kid brother. I'm going. I... I... I just don't see how you can still... Well, yeah, you don't know... No, that's your problem, Helen Keller, is you don't fuckin' see. You know, what... What's his number? - What number? - His fuckin' cell phone number, genius. - What good is that gonna do? - Turner doesn't have a cell. - What, what? - That's not normal. Who doesn't have a number? I don't think he can afford to pay for it. - Can you shut the fuck up? - Listen, listen, what kind of car does he drive? Oh, no, no, no, let... Let me guess. He doesn't have one of those even. Some kind of SUV, I don't know. Brownish SUV. What? Now, you guys wanna listen to me. I see him driving all the time. You... you know, good luck, though. Yeah, lots of brownish SUVs out there, asshole. Yeah, but guess what? I'll find him. Okay. You're better off finding your brother, though. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, that's what you should be doing. Hold up. I'll drive. - No, I'll drive. - I'll drive and you look. You know what you're looking for, I don't. It's better this way. And we need Robbie. - What? - Fuck that, man! No, he's staying. You know the places that this Turner guy would go, right? Uh, some, yeah. - Maybe... - We need you. No, you're staying. You're staying. - L... let's go, whatever. - Get that. Let's go. - Where do we start? - The beach. That's where I dropped him off this morning. - Let's go get him. - Good idea. - You're not coming with us. - Like hell, I'm not. I'm in this, too. No, no, you're really not, though. Well, we still have some things to figure out, so... Oh, my God! Besides, don't you have to wait for your little cousin, I mean, isn't he coming home from... No, he's a big boy now, he can take care of himself. - Fine, then I'll just wait for you here. - No, you will not. For sure. Shit. Oh, fuck. Yeah, no luck. Do you know what you're looking for? No. Does he? I'm assuming so. How long is he gonna take? He's your friend. Dude, I just met him today. He's not my friend. That's for sure. - Here comes your buddy. - Told you he wasn't gonna be here. - Where did you drop him off? - Right there, man. - I can't find him anywhere. - Yeah, but... But you dropped him off like what? - Six hours ago? - Yo, what's your fuckin' point? Dude, this is an endless beach. And you said he gets around, right? - You did say that. - Alright, so he got around. - He could be anywhere. - Let's... Let's check my house, alright? Maybe he's there. - Okay. - That's a big maybe, so go. - Go, man! - Alright, alright. - Whoa! - Which way? Just drive. - Just... I don't know where I'm going. - I don't... Ugh. - Go! - Uh, which way? So, what's your brother's name? It's David. I call him D, though. - Oh, that... That's cute. - Fuck you, man. - Oh, shit. - Ah, see? I fuckin' told you. Hey, what's her name? - Who? - The hot chick. Uh, her name is Bree. - Your girlfriend? - Hell no. My ex. - But you're still friends? - Nope. - What? - Plus, she... She's got a new boy toy, Brad. Uh, that girl is crazy. Fuckin' manipulative. I see. You know, this guy. - Uh, you invited him. - He's got issues. Uh-huh, you... You get it now. Still. No sign. Now where? - Fuck you, man. This is your fault, okay? - Hey, calm down! You... You're his roommate, you should have seen this coming. He's locked in his room all the time! How am I supposed to know what he's doing in there? If he's in his room, maybe that's a sign that something's not right! He never bothers anyone. He never did anything to anybody before today. Yeah, well, sometimes water boils slow, man. - What does that mean? - Shut up! Look, he may not be normal, but he's always, always been okay. - I'm gonna fucking kill you, man. - Hey, calm down! - You're gonna kill me? This is my car! - Yeah. Yeah. And then what? Yeah, and then I'm gonna fuckin' stick my dick in your nose and piss in your fuckin' face! - But if your dick is in my nose... - Shut the fuck up! - Just sayin'. - Look, I don't care how much you guys hate each other, - but you guys need to man up right now. - Yeah, tell him to fuckin', man. You're not in high school anymore! And this Turner guy, he is who he is. Robbie has nothing to do with that. Nope. We don't know all the details, so we can't just assume that something happened. Yo, fuck that, man! He has my brother's keys, okay? That means at some point today, he met up with my brother and now my brother's missing. Put the two together, okay? Just don't tell me it doesn't mean anything. I'm not. No one is. Let's just try to keep it together and we'll look somewhere else. Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. I... I don't think we should be looking for your brother. - Ugh! - No, no, no, just listen to me. Hear me out, okay? I think he'll be harder to track down. We need to be looking for Turner. - What? - Right? Think about it. - Did you try to calling him? - No, he... He doesn't have a cell, remember? Right. Where could Turner be? I... I have a few ideas. - So, this is Turner's place, right? - Yep. Where do we start? Well, that's his coffee shop, so we're lookin' for that brownish SUV. Come on, man. Can you be more specific? There's a bunch of brown SUVs. - Not a car guy. - I don't think he's here. I don't see him anywhere. Look, if he's not here, then let's go. You know, you can leave whenever you want, right? Yeah, we have to hurry, man. Come on. I don't think we could just hang out here and wait for him to show up. Here, let's round the lot once. Come on. - And what about your cousin? - What about him? Where is he? He's with his friend doing some kind of website thing. When was the last time you saw him? Really? I'm just asking a question. He's okay. He's with his friend. Are you sure? - Sure about what? - Well, was he with Turner Risk at any time today? Look, I'm tellin' you, he's okay. How're you so sure, man? I mean, aren't you a little worried? Especially with everything that's been going on today? Well, I wasn't. Yeah, well, I can't see why you're not. Look, if I were you, I'd at least try to text him or something. Well, you know what? You're not me. Yeah, hence the lack of intellect. Just text him, jackass. I don't think Turner would do anything to him, though. Yeah, well, he did somethin' to you. It wouldn't hurt. Nothing yet, huh? You know where we're going, right? Keep goin' straight. There's a park he likes to go to look at the trees, and the nature, and stuff. Huh, told you, dick. Wait. - What? - Shit. Who is it? - Let me see. - It's Bree. Fuck, man! It's gonna go on all day or what? Told you have to keep the line open for victim number 2. - And what does she want? - Hey. Hey, not cool, man. Well, tell her to go fuck herself. Probably already has. Tell her to do it again. You know, let... Let me see the phone, huh. Hey. Hey. Sit down. Dude. - Sit down. - Give me the phone. - Get off me, man! - Dude, put your seatbelt on. You made me rip my jacket, dick. You see that? It just split. Makes you feel any better, that was a fuck ugly jacket. - Fuck! - What now? What? - Over there. - Drop it, man. Well, I know he comes here a lot because we used to have lunch right over there. And I used to work right over there, 'cause there is a... Is... Is there another park that he... That he goes to or... - This is the only one I know about. - Shit, man. So, we're running out of options. I know. Hey, man, are you okay? What... What if he's in trouble, man? What if something happened to him? - Your brother's probably fine. - Yeah, but what if he's not? Then what, man? My mom can't handle this right now. Fuck! Fuck you! Fuck! - He's just... - Yes. He's blowing some steam, so just let him, yeah. Hey, Joey, it's your cousin. Some stuff's going down here, so I need you to call me back as soon as you can, okay? Seriously, man. Call me back now. Can I ask you a question? You just did. How did you get to know this Turner guy? Kindergarten. Yeah? He was a lot taller than everyone you know, so he definitely stood out. But he was quiet, like really quiet, so it's kinda weird, too. By... By the 3rd grade, I mean, everybody was picking on the guy. Yeah, it's understandable. You know, you didn't know him back then, so you can just shut up, yeah? Anyway, my teacher, she asked me to look out for him. More like pressured you. She told me that if you couldn't learn to connect with people, like really communicate, that someday he can become a problem. Yeah, and that day has come. So, I looked out for him and I mean... I guess that helped him, but by high school his reputation had preceded him and the... The poor guy didn't stand a chance, you know? And then along comes Mr. Conner Hudson over here. And what did you do? I don't see the point talking about that right now. I'm just, uh, tryin' to catch up. Yeah, Conner, what don't you go and tell him all about it? Okay. Back in the day, a couple of guys and me used to talk shit to him. So, one day I walked up to him and I punched him in the face. What? See, this is what I was talkin' about. I knocked him out. - I... I don't get... um... What did he do? - Nothing. He just... - He just was. - That's fucked up. - Yeah, and that was only one example. - Yeah, I did it. Okay? I did it and we... Yeah, uh, I was young. Yeah, and I was a fucking kid, too. Yeah, we've already established that you're perfect. I don't get it. Why would you do that? I don't... I... I... I don't know why I did. I didn't... I didn't like the guy. You didn't know the guy. Let me show you something real quick, yeah? Just look. We're in the 1st grade there. He's just an ordinary kid here. And here... Oh, shit. Here we were in uh, 4th grade. - Well, I think this is, uh, freshman year, 9th grade. - Hmm. Just look. And he made these, all by himself. You see? - Hmm. - Yeah, he's not perfect, but this, this is the Turner I know. The Turner that could have been and not the one you picked on but the one that was hiding from you. Let me see. He seems normal to me. - Normal was in there. - Just shut up. We were gonna save the world someday. What? We were in the 6th grade when 9/11 happened and our teacher partnered us all up, and asked us to figure out a way to save the world. So, Turner and I, we made a list of all the bad people in our lives, in the world. Like a hit list? Uh, well, we figured that if all the bad people were taken out of it, it would leave only the good people and it would be like a fresh start for a better world. So, that's what we thought. - You know it made sense to us. - Made sense? Oh, shit. "Come and get me." - It's Joey, right? - Yeah, yeah, I'm... I'm calling him right now. My... My brother's still missing, so... Hey, douche, where you at? Hello? Where at... Fuck! He's got Joey. What about Joe? Fuck. Hello? Fuck. Oh, shit. Fuck. Fuck you, Turner. Fuck, pick up the fucking phone! God dammit. We gotta fucking go! - Where is he? - Some park. - Which park? - Oak Canyon. I know that park. Yeah, I think Bree lives like 10 minutes from there. - Gosh, you calling her now? - What is she gonna do? I do... I don't know. She will just go check it out and see where's he at. Well, if she gets there, she won't be able to reach us, there's no signal. You know, it doesn't matter. She... she'll be fine... She'll go and see... Let me call my friend Park. He lives right by there. - Why didn't you say that before? - Dude, shut up! Look, did he say anything about my brother? - No! - Oh, shit. - Yeah, do that. Do that. - I told you, man. Latinos, they are different, man. They got this... this is Asian g... Asian girls, they cannot... - I know. - I'm telling you, man. - Take it off. - No, shut up. - Take it off! - You're... you're breaking my concentration right here, man. So, shut up. - No, no, no. - Alright, let's go back, go back. Oh, okay, okay, okay. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Hey, what's up? Well, hold on. Yeah, I'm in middle of something right now. - He is watching porn. - Oh, shit. Okay. Okay, stop yelling first. Okay, what do you want me to do, again? You want me to go up the park, okay. Okay. Okay, okay, there is the... What did he do? Okay, there is... What did he... What did he fucking do? Okay. Yeah, okay, I'll be there right now, man. Okay. - Who is it? - I gotta go. - Who is that? - Seth. - Where is he? - Somewhere. Are you gonna meet him at the park? Yeah, he needs my help. - I mean, you can come if you want. - Help with what? - Up to you. - Help with what? - Okay, there is this fucking guy, right? - Mm-Hm. And he's a bad guy, so I have to keep an eye on him. What kind of bad guy? I don't know about the details. No details, I need details. - Well, then don't come, okay? - What? - What about that Latina? What... - And close the door! Now, I know how you feel about it. - Your brother, I mean. - Yeah. Hopeless. Hang in there, guys. - Hopefully, everybody's alright. - Hope so. Park will be there. - I'm gonna kick his ass. - Yeah, I'm gonna fuckin' help you. Me, too. That's what I'm saying, man. Best features... - She's pretty. - No. No, she's... She's okay. What? She's so pretty, what are you talking about? Oh, my God. No, she's... She's... She's not that pretty. - Oh, my God. - A normal Japanese, okay? - Normal Korean pretty. - Okay, she's alright. Right. Maybe he's not here yet. Who? The fuckin' American. What does he look like, again? Well, Seth said he's a tall uh, white American with the... - tall with the brown hair. - Okay. And what are we supposed to do if we find him? We're supposed to make sure that he doesn't leave. Oh. - We have to beat him up? - No, I never said that. Jesus Christ! Jesus. Okay. So, what did the uh, fucking American guy do? Oh, he's a psycho, man. What do you mean? - That's all I know. - No more? No more, dude! Look, if you're worried, just go home, okay? - I can handle this by myself, okay? - Okay, just tell... Just tell me does this guy have a gun or something or is this guy a danger? I don't think so. - You don't know. - No, I... No... - You don't know. - I don't know. I just said that, right? Oh, wait a minute. Who is that lady, huh? I know. She's Latina. What? What? What? What? So, how long do we have to wait? Shouldn't be long. I'm going to the bathroom. What if he's in there, huh? I'll kick his ass! Park. Park. Oh, yeah. Oh. - You followin' me? - No. No English. No, no. - Shit, you're following me. - No English. No. I'm going out. Fuckin' American! Fuckin' American. Fuckin' American. Toshi! Turner, let him go! Turner, stop! Oh, yeah. You fucking shit. - Stop. - Shit! Oh, shit! Fuck you. You fuckin' shit. Stop. Stop. Stop Stop, don't shoot. Don't shoot. Stop, don't shoot. No, don't shoot. Oh, shit. No, no. Oh, please, please, no. - Yo, what the fuck are you doing? - What are you doing? This is the point of no return, guys. You know that, right? Once we get past that gate, whatever happens, happens. - Yeah, we get it. Okay, just go. - We know. Just go. We can just go back and call 911. Fuck the police! Alright, go! Look, Seth, if you don't wanna be a part of this, we understand, but we need to be in there. - So, you can just drop us off and leave, okay? - This isn't your thing, man. Alright. Just don't know what's going on still. Okay, let me explain to you the situation right now. My brother may be in there, okay? Your friend may be in there. His cousin may be in there. Go! - What's happening? - Where is he? No brownish SUV, keep going. The road just gets rougher from here on out. Dude. - Hey, what's that? - Seth, that's it. - Is that him? - The brownish fuckin' SUV. - That's Turner's. - Shit. Oh, man. Son of a bitch. - Where is he? - Fuck, man. Wh... Where's Park? I don't see anybody. Dude, something's not right here. I know. I feel the same. God dammit, fuck! I can't believe this is really fuckin' happening. - Dude, t... t... turn... Turn off the car. - Okay. Alright. Maybe he's in his car. I don't see anybody in there. - Well, maybe he's lying down! - Shut up. - What? - Shut up, shut up. - Can you hear that? - Stupid bitch. - Hear what? - Just listen. I hear it. But there's no one over there. Yeah, I kn... I know, but that's Turner's music. Well, figures. I hate classical music. So, what do we do? - I know what I'm gonna do. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait! Whoa, wait! Fuck. Stop fuckin' around, Turner! This is so fucked up. We're not interested in your bullshit! - Where the fuck is my brother? - Hey. Say something, coward! There's something wrong here. Let's go, bitch. - There's something not right here. - He's got a fucking gun. Oh, God. I said to come alone. Walk. Walk. Where is the other one, huh? Conner Hudson, your friend. Tell him he needs to stay back, tell him, Robbie, alright? - Tell him. - Conner, stay back. Stay back, Conner. I said to come alone. - You don't know how to walk? - Fuck! Oh, God! Oh, God, I'm shot. I'm shot, I'm shot! I'm shot. - Where, where, where, where? - My arm. - I... - My arm. I can't... let me help you. - I can't... fuckin'... Wait. - I can't see. Come back. Come back, please. Please. You can stop now. Turner, don't. Just... Just don't. - Don't look at me. - What are you doing? - Don't look at me. - Fuck you. Fuckin' shit, please. Can you at least put the gun down, please? - You ignore me. - No, I don't. Yes, you do. Yeah, I don't have any friends. I don't... - I'm your fucking friend. - ...have a single friend. - So, put the fuckin' gun down. - It's a lie, you're not my friend! - Not now. - I've always been there for you, you ungrateful shit. No, you haven't. Where is my cousin? Where's Joey? What... What did you do to him? Had to be done. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. - Oh, fuck. - Yeah. Yeah, I planned it all out carefully. So, there's no blood, no mess. - He's in a peaceful place now. - Jesus. When I torch it, he'll be a part of it forever, part of the forest. Fuck. - Part of the sky. - He didn't do anything to you. Why would you do... What the fuck is wrong with you? Sometimes you have to burn a forest down, so it can grow again. What the fuck are you talking about? This is a controlled burn. And just all this is I'm... I'm cleaning out all this junk that I don't need in my life. Fuck. You know, it's about time I started cleaning the world of all the people whoever treated me like shit! - Joey never did that to you. - You know he didn't like me! You didn't even know him, man. Okay, well, how long does it fucking take to get to know someone? You don't make it easy, though. No, they don't make it easy for me, okay? They make me out to seem like I'm not normal. - I'm the fucked-up one! - So, you deal with it. I am dealing with it! And Conner Hudson's brother. Why him, huh? 'Cause his brother picked on you once in high school? He more than picked on me. Yeah, he was a bully, but did you even know his brother? It doesn't make a difference. Bullies breed bullies. They always gang up all against one. So, you're saying Joey was because of me now? - What the fuck did I do to you? - Joey's because of everyone. So, everyone has to go. Oh, my God. - Shit. - You were my friend once. You're my only friend. I never stopped being your friend. But don't you see how you're fucking it all up? You killed my cousin. I had to do it! Oh! My God, Turner. You're so fucked up. There's no hope for you. Do you see that? So, what now? It's my turn? Yeah. Yeah. Fuck! - Please, no, no. Please. - I can't stop now. Yes. Yes, you can! We used to be good friends, remember? When we were kids. - You remember? - Yeah, we were gonna do things together. We were gonna save the world. We wanted to save the world, Turner! We're gonna save the world by taking out all the bad people in it and that is exactly what I am doing now. I get that! A lot of people don't treat you right. They don't understand you, but I did. And I always have! Fuck, I even let you live in my apartment! - Let me? - That's not the point. I have always been there for you and this is how you treat me? You point a gun to my fucking chest, you asshole. There are a lot of bad people in this world, Turner, and they all seem drawn to you, don't they? But I think it's you, man. You bring out the worst in them. - You're the constant here. - No, I am not! They are the constant, okay? They attacked me, Robbie! I didn't do anything to them! I know they affected you! And if you get rid of them, you can start all over clean, I get that. It's not fair. But think about all the people you affected here today. We talked about saving the whole world, Turner, not just yours! So, go ahead, man. Please, save the world. Save the world, man. Please. Okay. Well, we called the police, told them our story, told them about Turner. We also told them we didn't know what was going on, which isn't really too far from the truth. They sent out one cop. He says they'll check it out, the whole type that they'll get back to us. I think they failed to see the gravity of the situation. Dr. Isaac, dial zero. How the fuck did we get here anyway? We can't fully grasp everything that's happened, everyone we lost. I don't think our minds are ready for it. Hell! We're still figuring the world out. So, Seth was okay. Two shots and Turner only nicked his arm. The doctor tried to make him stay overnight, but Seth just wanted to go home. So, when do you want me to bring back your car? Maybe later today or tomorrow? Or I can take care of it for you. My parents will bring me. It'll be easier. Maybe tomorrow. They don't know anything yet. And we still don't know what happened to everybody else. Yes, we do. I'll see you tomorrow then. We all wanna make the world a better place, but no one can change the world really. We can only change ourselves. And Turner Risk, he couldn't do that. So, here we are. Yesterday becomes today, today becomes tomorrow, and only tomorrow is open for change. But, in the end, everything merges into one. We're all victims of the things we can't control. It's the nature of the world. Day in, day out, we fight the biggest bully of all. Life. We have no choice, but to stand strong no matter what comes. Keep moving forward. Merge into traffic. Don't look back.
