Please talk to me. Where's your mother? ...And therefor it fell upon sociologists... to develop sociology into a precise and exact science... based on real-world observation. But neither Saint-Simon, nor other sociologists, like Auguste Comte, were able to free themselves away from Idealism or Apriorism in their understanding of society. They believed that... every person has a certain knowledge within them... This is torture. Every person has an inner source... Don't be dumb. A source of what? It's just a kind of source inside us. Plato himself even spoke about... The Inner Source as a recollection... of beauty itself beheld by the soul... ...in the presence of the gods, before being incarnated in The Earthly Realm. "But it is not all souls that can "easily recollect the things learned in The Other World. "For there is no light of justice, "nor temperance of the higher thought... "...which are precious to souls, in their Earthly shadows. "But no soul may return "to the place from which it came, "for a period of ten-thousand years, as its wings will not grow before then." Your questionnaires... Folders... Sign here, and print your name there. Thank you. You're welcome. - Hello. - Your questionnaires... - Your folders. - Thank you. You're Welcome. Who is it? I'm a student. What do you want? It's a survey. Get away from my door, or I'll call the police. Let's take a break from the survey, shall we? Sure. Lera, dear. Why don't you have a small drink with us? - Pour her one. - Mm-hm. There you go. Happy birthday, Sergey. And above all else, we wish you happiness and good health. So long as you have good health then you already have everything that you need. He's... been working... thirty years at an industrial plant. His lungs are just... We've been married for thirty years. - Cheers. Bottoms up! - Bottoms up! - And to us. - And to our special birthday boy. Yeah? Oh! Here, dear. Here, take a pickle. Take a pickle. - It'll help. Go on. - Eat it all up. - Eat the whole thing. - Go on. Bite right into it. Feeling better, now? That went well. Ah. Have a slice of cheese. And, here you go! And some cold cuts. Go on, give her some more. Eat up. So, who comes up with these questions? Special Services. Mm... Wow. I'm really sorry... but I have to go now. - Oh. - What if uh... I fill in the questionnaire myself and if anyone calls just say that I talked to you for an hour. No, no, no, no, no. When civic duty calls on you... - you've got to... do your part. - That's right. It'll be alright. Cheers, cheers, cheers. I'm sure there are just a few more questions. Mm-hm. Ooh, that's strong! Sergey, you made this batch extra strong. "In which era would you rather live?" "Pre-Revolution, The Soviet Union, the current era suits me just fine." Valya, which era would you rather live in? I don't know... Pre-Revoltion! - Really? - Why? Why not? I could go for rides in my horse-drawn carriage, cooling myself with a fan. "Do you like living in Russia, or would you rather go abroad to live in another country?" Mm... Oh, I'd rather move. Where to? Oh, I'd move to the, uh... Damn it. I forgot... Sveta, what's that place called? You know, that place...? - Where are you talking about? - You know... Urgh! Sergey, remember... Stepan brought us those things from there! - What things? - For God's sake, it's right on the tip of my tongue... - That's enough, that's enough. - We won't... get into any trouble answering like this, will we? - Not at all. - Well... then let's have another drink. We'll have a drink to... Valya's nameless choice of residence... And... wherever it may be. I'll remember what they're called! May everything there be perfectly fine! Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! - And most importantly... - A good life to you all! - Hear hear! - Everyone! - Peace on Earth! - Yes. Why are you laughing? We should drink to world peace. Bottoms up. Ah, well done! - Mm. - Give the child some warm food, will you? She needs something solid in her stomach. What's wrong? Why aren't you eating, my child? - Why isn't she eating? - Because her plate is empty! Come on, help me serve your guest. Alright, alright. - There you go. Dig in. - Here you go. Eat up, enjoy! We slow-baked it, so it should be good. Sveta. Wait a minute. - Start from the top. - From the top. The leaves of Autumn They whirl and fall, to the ground And softly lay That old-time waltz In dreams of The Fall The accordion does still play The music sings And yearns and sighs And listening To its charms In dream-filled slumber Close your eyes My fellow brothers-in-arms This waltz was also playing when We were at The Spring Dance We danced that waltz With our first loves Engulfed in our romance Their eyes shone light Into our hearts And then so much they told To hearts and souls Of boys in love Who were but twenty years old And when we hear that song again Perhaps for the last time We soldiers listen To its sounds And thoughts rush Through our minds Go inside. Watch your step. You alright? Come on. Eat your lunch and then we'll go out for a walk. Lera, I had a revelation. I just figured out everything. The Earth is speeding around The Sun at one-thousand eight-hundred fifty miles per hour. Yeah, so? Think about it. We're sitting here perfectly still... meanwhile our planet... is hurtling through space at breakneck speed! Eat your lunch. Here you are. Would you like a cup of tea, dear? Sorry, I won't have time. Is this what you do every day for your job? No, it's schoolwork, if I don't do it, I won't get a passing grade. Oh, now I understand. "What feminine hygiene products do you use and indicate the brand?" I'll fill that one in myself. "How many times a week do you drink alcoholic beverages?" "I don't drink; Once a week; Twice a week; More than twice a week?" You don't drink. Moving on. "How does flirtation at work make you feel?" Damn. "Are you satisfied with your socio-economic situation and your standard of living?" "Yes; No; Difficult to say?" S... Sati... Satisfied. I'm satisfied. - You're satisfied. - Mm. "How do you cope with difficulties?" "Life is difficult but you have to hope for the best." "Difficulties help to build character; I don't have any difficulties." Oh, my dear, life is always full of difficulties. But you have to hope for the best. "Are you happy?" Oh... I'm long past... ever thinking about happiness now. You can only answer Yes or No. Let's just say, "Yes" then. Yes, alright. "What income level do you aspire to reach?" "Indicate in Rubles." Well, right now... M... my personal pension is eight-thousand Rubles. It was increased by... six-hundred Rubles recently. It was seven-thousand four-hundred... and... now it's eight-thousand. So, that's it. Eight-thousand Rubles. You want me to write eight-thousand Rubles? Open the door, or he'll break it again. He's going to break it anyway. I'm opening it. Mom, go to your room. He's not staying. Girls... I, uhm... I want to talk. I, uh... Please, you need to go. This stress isn't good for her. I want to tell you that... I love you. Mom, go back to your room. Talk to me. Please, just listen to me! I just want to tell you how much you mean to me. I... I just want to talk. Lera, come here! Fine! Sit down and let's talk like normal people! What are you yelling at me for?! Just stop it! The both of you! - What have I done? - Leave us alone! And stop bothering us like this! Why can't you understand? What are you doing? Not like this. My baby... Alex... Does he beat you? No, he never has. Please, sir. I'm begging you. Please don't tell the police. To be honest, it's just a mild abrasion, but I'm required to notify the police when there's a weapon involved. Do you have cash? Oh, shit. That's a Hell of a bruise. - Can you do this up for me? - Let me see. Leave me alone. You in a bad mood again? You know who's always in a good mood? Tanya. I don't think I've ever seen you in a bad mood. I believe in positive thinking. Oh, look who decided to show up! Oh, it's Gerda the human suction pump! Didn't suck enough dicks already today? Leave her alone, Tanya. No, I'm happy for her. It's a busy night. Should be plenty of dicks for her to suck. Right, Gerda? What the Hell was that look? Oh, here we go. I asked you a question, you bitch. What was that about? Why are you being so mean to her? Come on, girls, leave her alone. Are you fucking crazy? When did you suddenly get so brave, Gerda? Look me in the face. Have you lost hold of your senses altogether? Come on, stop it! Leave her alone, you're just being mean. Gerda, is something the matter? Look at me. It's OK. Come here. Sh, sh... Shush... Shhh... Oh... You don't need to cry. I was only teasing you. OK. Calm down now. You're alright. Shhh... Sh, sh... Shhh... Everything's gonna be OK. Here's all I can spare. - Here's two grand. - Mm-hm. Don't be stingy. You had a house-call yesterday. I'm not giving more than that. Damned junkie. Girdle, you only get ten grand. Go and suck someone off if you want five more. I'm teasing you. Here. Thanks. Girdle, I'd suck off the whole town if it would help my mother. Tanya, customers are asking for you. Are you serious? It's four in the morning. Do your job. Nadya... cut it out. Alright, I'm going. Lera... - Is something wrong? - It's five thirty-eight. This crappy cake was all I could afford. Wait, where'd you get the money for it? My private stash. Five thirty-nine... Oy... Ah... You OK? What time is it now? Five thirty-nine. Five forty-one. Hooray... Happy birthday! Thank you. Lera, I found out something. Just don't be annoyed, OK? Go on. On your birthday, every cell in your body becomes new again. And you become new. You're given a new program, an update, every year. And you should say this to yourself on that day: I am totally new. I can be anything that I want. Different. The past has been eaten by The Langoliers. Now I'm new. I've been reset. By who? The Langoliers. - The monsters with sharp teeth in that movie. - Mm-hm. And so you can choose any kind of new you. Just think what you would most like to be, and then the program will start to run. - Mm... Damn it. - What? I'd love a drink but we don't have anything. - Lera. - Just a second. I'll give my friend a call. Here's to you. Why are we whispering? I don't know. This cake is delicious. It's too sweet. I like it like this. Why is there jelly candy in it? - There isn't any candy in it. - What's this, then? I think that candy must bring you good luck. Did you not get one? - Shit, no! - Drink up! I think it's time to give this room a makeover. I'd like to start with the wallpaper. Why are you laughing? In that case why not just marry me. And we'll adopt her. We'll be a happy, little family. Cheers. To you. To Lera and her wings. Oleg, did you know Lera has wings? Oh, not this again. Yes. You can... see them in this photo. It's just a crappy print job on that photo, that's all. Hm? You can't be serious. They're just not showing right now. Right now she's under so much pressure that she can't spread her wings, but one day... - That's enough, really. - OK. You don't need to get angry. You really do have wings. Get comfortable. Here you go. Happy birthday. Wash it down. If it tastes gross. My leg's gone to sleep already. They dropped it when they were paying at the bar. They're seem to have a shit-load of cash. ♪ I fled to the ocean Go on, take a hundred. That's alright, you already lent me money. You don't have to pay me back in that case. Those guys out there want the two of you. Sorry, my shift is over. Fine, suit yourself. You nuts? They have shit-loads of money. Don't go anywhere with them. Look at this bag. How much dick have you been sucking, huh? It's not worth looking at. - This one is fake. - Jesus... Even a real one looks like shit. Oh, fuck you. - Oh, look at you! - Tanya, are they waiting for you? Goodnight, bitches. - Of course, what's she gonna do here? - Goodnight. Girl, you're wasted. - Let's go back to my place. - Go on and make some money! Pfft... I'll be a good girl. - Are you trying to convince yourself? - Yeah, right. Are you trying to convince yourself? - Hey, that's promise. - Tanya! - Oooh! - See that? Uh-huh... Do two at a time. What a slut! There she goes, she's in. Where's that one going? How about saying good night? - Mm-hm, slut. - Hey, look. - Wow, what is she doing? - Wait, hold on a second... - Where the fuck is she going? - She needs the cash. Why did she get in with Tanya? Tanya, let's get out of here. What are you, a wuss? Why'd you come with me, then? Do you know how much we can get? See how much money these guys have? This wad of bills just fell out one of their pockets. Sup? Sup. - Oh! - No. - Just what I need. - Oh, yeah? Thank you. You're welcome. Don't be too long. Tanya, let's get out of here. He looks like a sea lion! Aw! Aw! Aw! Two whores at once. We'll see how long they last. - Oh... - Here they come! Hot stuff! So... How's it going, ladies? You're... Tanya. Mm-hm. And you're... Lera. You can dance on my pole tonight. And then on mine. Sure, we'll all take turns. - Yeah? - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, slow down. Go easy on the booze. Hey, take it easy. You OK there? She's OK. Hey, come on, Lera, sit down. What the Hell. Tanya passed out. Hey! Hello! What the Hell? What's wrong, baby? Come on. - Tanya! - Hey! What the fuck just happened? - Is she even still alive? - Tanya! Hey, hello! - Hey, Lera! - Tanya... You'll have to work double-time now, to make up for her. Tanya, just relax. I've got something that'll make you feel better. Please, I really need to take her home. - She's not well. - Sure, you can take her home later. The fuck are you talking about? The fuck are you talking about? I know, seriously, what the Hell! Don't try to make it look like we're rapists. Either give back the money, or spread your legs. - I vote for the latter. - Do it, or we'll call the police. Call the police, we haven't done anything wrong. - There's no need to call, we're already here. - They wouldn't come anyway. - Ding-dong! Police are here! - Open up! You're going to do it standing? I want to sing a song. Go on, Rick, give her something to sing about! Get her a microphone. Here's a microphone. Sing. Right into the microphone. Snow What a soft and lovely snow What is this? - To the castle I will go - Come on, already. Across the snow Just like a dream - She's gone insane. - Tracks There's a single line of tracks Like somebody's fleeting life Soon they fade and disappear See Everybody needs a friend A truly fond and loving friend Who will shield you from despair Call Though you may be a world away In a storm of snow or hail Call on me and I'll be there Friend My most precious Faithful friend You and I we can transcend To our secret dream-like land Please May our friendship always last Like a beacon on the coast May it shine until the end See Everybody needs a friend A truly fond and loving friend Who will shield you from despair Call Though you may be a world away In a storm of snow or hail Call on me and I'll be there - Yeah... - That was... You're... something else. You're really... Hm... Hm... - Hey, give me another drink, I need one. - Relax... It's done... To friendship. - Fuck, I'll probably never get hard again! - What's going on here? I don't know what's happening anymore. What a champ. - Cheers. - Go on. Take your friend, you're done now. And get the fuck out. Lera. Lera! Open the door. Water. No, cold only. Who are you?! The Greeks believe that... when a person sleepwalks... it's because their soul is... looking for a way out of the body. The soul is... already kind of free... but the body doesn't realize it. But the bond is already broken. And there's no going back. So the soul begins to wander... when the body has gone to sleep... ...and waits for it to fall asleep forever. That's enough. The Greeks believed that. Oleg, you're an artist? Uh... sort of, I guess. Here. That's wonderful. I've always wanted to paint. But I'm no good at it. These freaking walls... are so uneven. Here. Lera, put some more paste on the edges. And here as well. Where my knee is. That's wonderful. How do you earn a living as an artist? Do you sell many paintings? No, I bury people. Painting is just a hobby. Mom, his sense of humor is shit. He's joking. Once again, the survey calls for direct contact with the respondents. And we all know too well what kind of people the respondents could be. Some of them may simply refuse to even speak to you. Or you may be faced with a variety of responses, such as: "What's all this for?" "This survey won't change anything anyway." "This is just nonsense." "Who's paying for this?" Even if somebody refuses to cooperate... as the interviewer, you must remain calm. You will need to use psychology to analyze the situation, anticipate how the interview will develop... and steer the respondent in the right direction, and monitor... reactions and attitude. It's important to note... that sociological surveys can aid in the study of human behavior. Come in and sit down. Have a seat. - Mmh... - Excuse me. Could I use your bathroom, please? Yes. Of course. It's in the hallway, on the right. Why is your cat yowling? He's castrated and the other cat's in heat. Uhm... Does he know that he's been castrated? I don't suppose so. Excuse me. Maybe we should talk in the kitchen. You know what, uhm... I just remembered... Uh... I'm late for class. Mm... I'd better get going, please excuse me. - You can come back later. - Sure. Mom, go to sleep. He won't let me. Girls... I love you so much. Let's sit down and talk together. Mom, go to bed! For fuck's sake... Lera, don't judge me, alright? I'm your father. Your mother... and I will settle our difference ourselves. So you go to bed. You got that? Mom... please... go to sleep. Irina, let's have a talk. You can have a talk with me, instead. Lera, at least do you love me? Let's have a drink. Let's get your mom. Please, just let her sleep. I'll drink, but don't you... even think about it. I said don't drink, God damn you! Lera... - Wake up. - Are you sick? No. Come to my room. This has to be done. We need to set your father's soul free. As I was falling asleep... this thought appeared in my mind. I hope everything works out... well for him... being with that woman. Then suddenly... there was a... green flash outside the window, and I realized... it was his soul. We need to... release it from being tied to here. Don't be angry with me. I got up and knew exactly what we have to do, I even started shaking. So let's do it now. This is his soul. I hope everything works out well for our Daddy. Lera... Let's make a wish together... that his soul will be released from here forever. "How many people are there in your family?" Me, and my son in The Army. "What is your place of work?" I mainly work from home, and at a tailor's shop every three days. "How much is your monthly income per family member?" Hmm... I guess it's twenty-five thousand... if you were to count my son. "How much if you were to include income that was undeclared?" Twenty-five thousand. "During the past year, your financial situation has: "Improved; Remained the same; Become worse; It's difficult to say." Improved. "Do you agree with the following statement: "In spite of obstacles and... difficulties, the country is on the right path." I agree. May I see the living conditions of your accommodation? How many rooms do you have? Three. Are you married? I'm divorced. Do you have a lover? What kind of questions are these? Just standard ones. Do I have a lover? Why would you ask me a question like that? Please do something to stop my father from coming and bothering us all the time. ...but people tell me I'm funny, so... Go on, tell us a joke. Say something... classic. - You should keep notebook with you, with all your jokes in it. - Yeah, good idea. Roman Trakhtenberg used to have one that he could look at. - Yeah, that's right. You know who he was? - Yeah, of course I do. But he died before you were even born. Sure, but so what? - No, listen. - Alright... When an apple ripens it has seeds inside of it. The fruit drops, and it begins to rot, and it provides nutrients and then a new tree begins to grow from the seed. The soul reincarnates the same way. What as? Well... Most anything. A human, an animal, a plant... And what happens to the body after it... dies? The body begins to rot. - And then? - The worms eat it. - And that's it. - But I can see myself still existing after my body has rotted - been cleared away by the worms. - No, what you're... I can imagine myself as a different being. You aren't ever going to be a different being. You'll just be yourself till you die. And then you'll just die. Pizza's here, if you want any. Oh-ho! Ahh... It's hot. This looks good. You guys want some pizza? Which ones do you like? I like that one. Which? That one? Mm-hm. Just the one? Mm, yeah. Have some pizza. We had this fat woman to bury. She was really huge. Her fuck-wit kids... were too cheap to buy an extra-large coffin for her. Once she was lying in the coffin we couldn't even get the lid to stay closed. I tried cramming her back in but her sides... still stuck out. I had to knead her in like she was dough... so I could try to hammer the lid down. And did you? I did. ♪ Eternity ♪ Eternity ♪ Ooh ♪ Eternity ♪ Ooh ♪ Eternity ♪ Ooh ♪ Eternity ♪ Ooh ♪ - Well, happy birthday. - Wooo! Woo-hoo! - Wooo! Ha! - Wooo! - Happy birthday, gorgeous. - Thank you, my girls.

All of the bridges that we are building have to undergo many checks, and in all these years no violations and no deviations from the project have been identified. The piles are driven to a depth of two-hundred and seventeen feet. In the future, as we move towards the fairway the depth of the piles will increase to between two-hundred thirty and two-hundred thirty-six feet. Work on pile driving is carried out round the clock, - Hey there. - in two shifts. That way we can stay on schedule... Hello. Excuse me. I'd like to ask you some questions for a survey. So, for an entire bridge just over three miles long, six-hundred individual pieces are required. For every thirteen feet of length the roll is forty inches. Then they are filled with concrete. The quality of the concrete and the metal, the technical process itself, is checked for each and every pile. Each support is monitored by hundreds of sensors. All of the readings from the sensors are streamed to our database, and you can see immediately in real-time what is happening. The compression, the tension, how this pile responds to what we have installed on top of it, and how we load it. Everything is taken into account regarding wind... Are you from Social Services? A one-fiftieth scale model of the bridge was placed... No. I'm a fairy that grants people wishes. The Barrier railings that we use, are also very carefully manufactured, taking into consideration all aspects of safety What would you like right now more than anything else? They are designed to avoid having any effect... Chocolate. In tests we create airflows around them from different angles and various speeds. We observe what kinds of turbulences are created and then calculate whether or not they could pose any hazard. If they could damage the structure itself, or blow vehicles off... Hey, why are you still lying in bed? Come on, wake up. I'll make us some tea. Come on, sleepy-head, you'll be up all night if you sleep all day. It's time to get up, come on! Hey! Wake up! Mom? Mom! Mom! Mom! Momma! Mom! Momma! Mommy! Wake up! You hear me? Wake up!! Wake up. You stop it right now, you hear me? Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Momma! Lera... What's wrong? I lost my wallet somewhere. What were you dreaming about? It seemed to me that... on the other side of that forest, I would find a completely different life. The kind of life... I could only dream of. I ran through the forest, through the rain. The raindrops were hitting my face and... I knew that was it. It was over. I had tricked the world. I ran along the forest path... so far... and I felt so happy just to be there. I felt so happy and weightless, because I knew that... at last I'd found the path for me, there in that forest. I knew it was leading me... ...to a new and wonderful world... of a kind I'd never seen before, but knew everything about... since I was a child. I was absolutely certain I would see it soon, because it was... calling to me, beckoning so strongly. It looked deep inside me while I... sat there peeing. It was as if it was telling me that I'd... never had a plan. I'd never had any plan that was clear for my life. But at that moment... I understood everything and I ceased to be useless. What happened then? I suddenly saw a fence. I saw it and I lost consciousness. After that I was in hospital. Then I went back home. You were little. Except maybe I never did come back. You can't really come back again. No, I definitely returned. I loved you, and I loved your father. But I was already different. I already knew that I was different, and I would always be like a fish out of water. I would always... feel out-of-place because I... ...caught a glance... ...of a completely different life. Mine. Tha' one's mine. No, wait. Yeah, that's mine. Oleg, I feel cold. Hold on. It's still good. Won't your customer be offended? He doesn't care anymore. At this point his doors of perception are shut. So now... do we have a free pass to The Underworld? Hi, Lera... Come here, sweetie. Hey. Come over here, you rotten, little kid. Let daddy give you a kiss. Come here, Lera... Girls, I'm gonna shoot. Want me to shoot? No, don't. No, no, no, no! No! Not a fucking chance. Just stay calm, he won't do anything. Ah... You think your daddy is full of shit? Will you at least talk to me... Lera? Lera... Sit closer. You still love your father, don't you? You little shit. You're all that I have left. Sweetie... Oh... My sweetheart. Do you love your daddy? They like to climb mountains. Give it a mountain to climb up. Look at it. - Now we have two ladybugs. - Oop. That's right, two. See? They're not scared of you. Oh, yeah... Now this one. Wow. Oh. Wait. Where's the other one? Huh? I'm going to share a very special secret with you. Promise not to tell anyone? I promise. The truth is I'm not really your mommy. I'm actually The Queen of Ladybugs. See how many are around us? They all came here to find me. Now I'm going to fly away with them to our magic land. In that land, I am their Queen and I rule supreme. They're going to take me away now. Mom, can I please go with you? Nighty-night, my sleepy-headed little Lera... Sleep tight, don't let those pesky bedbugs bite. But if they do bite... I'll take off my shoe... and slap them till they're black-and-blue. Holy shit! I've lost my service piece! Lera... Oh... OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK... Where's my badge? Ah! Ah, here it is. I broke out in a cold sweat there. Lock the door behind me, OK?
