Are you sleeping or what? Didn't you see me flashing? Good-for-nothing moron! We're harvesting! There's no time for snoozing! Oh, not him. Stupid jerk. Isabelle! Nice little kitty. I wish you'd been at the meeting. But you weren't. No big deal, I managed alone. As usual. Hold on for two seconds. I'll be right back. - So where are you at? - He just left. He'll be back. - He left? - Yeah, he'll be back. He's been gone for two months now. He's making fools of us with this telecommuting. Are you crazy? - We're working on... - What work? - On this file. - What's the progress on that? You can't use chemicals near the house. - Plus, my wife's almost pregnant! - Call him on his cell phone. This is unbelievable! Hello, Mr. Vives? Hold on. I'm putting Mr. Senac on. - Vives... - Hello, Mr. Senac. You're 30 minutes from Paris by train, right? Yes. I can't hear you. I'm in a tunnel. Then be in my office in half an hour, or you're fired. - I'm on my way. - I've had it! What the hell's he doing? Fuck! - May I switch rooms, please? - We'll see. It's great here. Your tractor... they came to take it away. Your monthly payments... were they paid UP? When you take out a loan-- loans are great, but you've got to remember to pay them off. But, no, not you! You'd rather sleep, goof off. - Here? - Nothing. - Here? - Nothing. So the challenge for Stefan Everts is to try for a fourth consecutive victory, which would put him, depending on how Pichon does, in first place for the championship. The Italian Frederici is losing time due to a mechanical problem. He's now under pressure, since Crockard is on his tail... it's becoming obvious who'll be favorite at Namur. It's incredible how it all happens. There are five Grand Prix left and this is a crucial moment. I've more or less caught up with Pichon now, but I can't let up on the attack. Namur is next. It's one of my favorite tracks... You should be able to go alone now, like your neighbor. The twins can leave. They can't get any better. Good news, gentlemen. You're free. Don't lose hope. Never lose hope. Science makes progress every day. And I'm not pulling your leg. I'll take off. I'm beat. I'm like the ball in a pinball machine, rolling, rolling... Jeez, it's hot. You got A.C. in your truck? I sure wish I did. My brother-in-law's got a tractor with A.C. But not me! You got A.C.? It uses a lot of juice, though, you're right. I bought a car. I had the choice between ABS and A.C. I opted for safety. A.C... I mean, ABS. 7000 francs! I am still using francs. But there's no denying A.C. wouldn't be bad. Next time maybe. It's hot. The other day, I drove his tractor-- my brother-in-law's. You set the A.C. at 72, it doesn't budge. It stays at 72. Morning to night, works like a charm. It's marvelous. Time just flies. If you're too hot, one notch less. But no lower than 70, 71, but never lower, 'cause when you get out, you catch cold. It's a choice. But it takes a lot of juice. I heard it uses... a good liter. Of diesel. Anyway, in 10, 15 years, we'll get A.C. automatically. Won't even be a choice. You'll see. You'll have it. Of course. Sure thing. No doubt about it. Isabelle? Here's a buddy for you. What are you doing here? Shit! This pen doesn't work. Pisses me off. - For Helsinki? Are you together? - No, no. - Where are you going? - Namur. Okay, I'll book your tickets. But for special people like you, we need 24 hours to get someone to take care of you. Okay. Yeah, okay. - Passports, please. - Sure. - Here. - Thank you. The passport, please. We booked our tickets yesterday. One for Helsinki, the other for... Namur. The reservation code was QTV... or U-- I forget-- 7, uh... Without I.D. there's nothing I can do. Sorry. But we told you, we were robbed-- I.D., credit cards, money... I wish I could help you. You can't do anything by name? No, there's nothing I can do. I'm sorry. - Two chicken legs. - Two legs. - What do you have for dessert? - Fruit salad. - Nothing else? - Nothing else. Okay, two fruit salads. Service ends in five minutes. Hang in there, my pea-brained little fellow! Remember Albert Libertad. During the Belle Epoque, that scandalous little gimp revolutionized his entire world! Hobbling on his crutch, he crashed political meetings of every kind. He climbed onto podiums, got around on his bottom, and with his crutches, he even knocked down the security guys who were trying to get him out. He even called for desertion! He sang in every street, and in workshops too, where he encouraged the end of needless deeds. He torched every identity card he could get his hands on. He popped up in churches right in the middle of mass, and he called the priests at the altar "scumbags" and the faithful on their knees "jackasses". He destroyed cemeteries, ranting against respect for the dead, the cult of dead meat. And he mocked closed-minded, bourgeois marriage by shacking up with nuns. Viva Albert Libertad! Sir... Solidarity among bikers. I can spare three or four euros. - 50! - I don't have that. - 50! - I don't have 50 euros. Sir, excuse me. Can you give me some information, please? You heartless jerk! Haven't you ever been hungry or cold? - Let me go! - You piece of shit! Give me your dough! - Asshole! - Help! - Can I help you? - Yes, please. - What do I do exactly? - Pull. - Help! - He's doing it on purpose. - Who's doing it on purpose? - He is. Take that. He put the brake on, you know. He put the brake on. How can we...? - I tried. - Help! - Sir. - Help me. Thanks. - But, really, against his will... - Then, talk to him. - I don't know him. - And you think I know him? Excuse me, sir. May I ask you something? Is this street-- You piece of shit! Haven't you ever been hungry or cold? Why are you doing that? - Have you ever been hungry or cold? - Yes, I have. Well? - Zilch. - Ditto. Spaces For Rent 2 Euros Shit! Come on! I've got a blood clot. I need my shot. I've got this blood clot, you see. Auntie Roberte? Oh, she's doing fine. She's fine. Sorry. I mean she's dead. Anyway... She died, in fact. But, on the other hand, Aunt Olga's going strong. Aunt Louqui, Aunt Louqui... - And...? - My cousin Micheline's mother. Anyway, now all I remember is what happened in the Congo. They waved, "Bwana, Bwana!" You see, I took myself for a bit of a-- as if I were-- Like the Pope in his popemobile. See what I mean? I waved like a damn fool. I remember your first piss. I remember very, very well how you learned to pee. It was incredible. Straight ahead. What was I going to say? What was extraordinary is that they lived in villages, in the bush, like that. What they did, uh-- Take a right here. I'd go into the village and all the kids were going, "Bwana, Bwana" like I was the Pope in my popemobile. It was unbelievable. So I waved like a jerk. Then what happened... Uh, right, I realized that... - Hang a right. - Seeing us like that-- Be careful! Okay. Seeing us... appear from one edge of the horizon to the other, they thought we came from Heaven. How far is your goddamned thing? 'Cause I got to get my shot. - It's straight ahead. - Keep going straight. - Straight. I mean, right. - We're almost there. Okay, 'cause you know... All the memories-- it's incredible what we remember. It's wonderful, in a way. Isn't this great? Jeremy, know why black people don't do motocross? Because when they jump, they stay in the trees! Give me a kiss. Give your dad a kiss! There you go. That's motocross! - Where's Pichon? - There. And who was in first place? Evert! And who's Evert? Champion of...? Seventy-time world champion! Do you realize that? 70 times! He and his father together held the title 90 times. No, you're mistaken, sir. - What's that? - I said, you're mistaken. - How so? - Don't listen to your father. Everts was six-time world champion. His father, twice. That's eight total. - What did I say? - 90. 90-time champion. Excuse me, sir, but motocross has a history. Listen up, Superman, being a cripple doesn't mean you can open your big mouth! - Come on, Pop. - It's fine, Jeremy. You're lucky the kid's here. Know what, Jeremy? Let's go to the concession stand. Because we can. We can go, we can come back, and go and come back... as much as we want. Wanna run there, Jeremy? I've got such good legs! Asshole! You can't stay here, guys! It kills the dream. Got to go! Who's that? That's Joél Robert! - Well? - Great! - Where's my sandwich? - I got even better. Look! Automatic Husqvarna tryouts. The only one in the history of motocross. 1982. You don't need your feet to ride it. You're starting to really drive me nuts with your bikes! Can't you see you're fucked? You're the one who said, "it's all over!" Get it? Your teenage dreams, your stats, your champions... Even your Joél Robert told you to fuck off. Joél Robert's got the right. You know who he is? - No, I don't. - Six-time world champion between 1962 and 1972. He can tell me to fuck off. Next to him, I am a piece of shit. And so are you. We all are. Worse than that, we're dead. You're dead! I'm alive! I'm alive! I'm hungry, I'm cold! I feel like kicking some ass! Go on, beat up a cripple! Go on! Who gives a shit!? I just want to go to Finland! Fuck off! Go to fucking Finland then! NO, HO, you can go on. Let's go, let's go! People are nice. Where'd that come from? From some nice people's fridge. Our Father, Who alt in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. What comes next? It seems to be going down. Go! Go! Motherfucker! Listen to this. "Hakan Carlqvist, world champion in 1988 in Namur"-- right where we were. '"Namur particularly lends itself to farce, as the track passes right by a bar, The Monument Chalet'"-- we were there. '"I've always envied the spectators sitting on the terrace of that bar while we were roasting on our bikes. So I asked my brother to sit there and order me a beer, just in case I had time to stop by and drink it on one of the last laps. Well, that's what I did. I soaked my mustache and it was good."' What a time that was! Can you imagine Michael Schumacher stopping for a beer today? - That was Everts. - Evens'? First'? Accident. Accident. I want to go to Finland. My accident wasn't in Finland. I want to go to Finland. No salad dressing? No salad dressing. It's good. Now you can buy your automatic Husqvarna and go to every Grand Prix in the world. Follow me. Come on, you fucks! Do you think we're morons? We're here! Which one of you motherfuckers built my trailer? They can't hear you. Give us our legs back! - Give us our legs back! - Pieces of shit! Did you build my trailer? Go on, act like you're working. Crooks! Cripples make you laugh, huh? You're gonna pay! You're gonna pay! I've got the whole file! Because of your lousy equipment, we lost our legs! Understand? Your lousy equipment! - We want compensation. - Six million euros. - Six million euros per person. - Each. Aaltra equipment, there you have it! I didn't travel 2000 miles to not speak to the boss! Call the manager. 2000 miles! You'll have to run me down with a tractor! Are you gonna listen now? The manager! I want to see the manager! Compensation! Six million euros. Six million! Six million euros! Who writes your instruction manuals? Isn't there a translator? Nobody? I want my money! My compensation! - Six million. - Got that? Call the manager immediately. Spends her time chatting with her girlfriend, or whatever. Don't you even see us here? We lost our legs! Does that mean nothing to you? - Aaltra is on the other side of town. - Six million dollars. Imitators... I see you know my equipment well. You want to work here? Well, yeah. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. 7:00. 7:00? - A-m. - 8:00. - Only on Sundays. - Only on Sundays? But today's Monday. To Libeltad the gimp
