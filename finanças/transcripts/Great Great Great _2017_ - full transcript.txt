So what are you saying? Sometimes taking control means letting go. Yeah, and now you're getting a divorce? Neither of us are moving out. Things will stay mostly the same. It's just now we'll be roommates. Dad, you're okay with this? Yeah, I guess. Nothing lasts forever. Hey. Hi. So my parents are insane. I have no idea what they're doing. They told me they're getting a divorce. - So- - My god. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I just- I can't believe they're giving up so easily. It's so, like, mediocre. Why is your Lego all over the place? - Sorry, I- - Just clean up your shit, okay? You sure you're okay? Do you want me to make you a drink? Yes. And bring me, like, five pounds of cake. Remember our flat on the 6th of Paris? We can get treats anytime we want. I would sell my ovaries for a macaron right now. Want to tell me what happened with your parents? No, I just- I don't want to talk about it. Okay. Is there anything you want to do? So you don't want to tell me what happened with Matt and Carol? They gave up. The just had it all, and they gave it up. But, you know, it's their lives. They can fail if they want to, it's not us. No, it's not. That's why I didn't want to talk about it. But I do want to talk about is how we're going to make sure it doesn't happen to us. We've been together five years, and I turned 30 last month. So... Okay, alright... Okay, what can we do? Well, like, goal setting. You know, making the most out of our lives. Striving for the best for ourselves and for each other. I feel like that's maybe a bit of a superficial solution to a problem that doesn't exist. - Tom. - Well, no, I- I'm just- Okay, I'm sorry. Alright. Specifically, what do you want to do? I don't know. I can improve my French, and make new business plans. And you can get serious about finding a job, and working out, and even make some new friends. Okay, I mean, my friends just hang out and talk about my old work. It's really embarrassing. I'm sorry. How am I not serious about finding a job? I don't know. I just- I'm not here during the day. I come home and I see you drinking and playing Legos, and I don't know. What do I have to do next? Add the sugar gradually. I just don't understand why are lives are so inadequate all of a sudden. I don't think that's the right word. Okay, what's the right word? It's more like- You know what, I'm just going to go to bed. - I'm sorry. - No, no, it's okay. - No, but I- - It's fine. - I said I'm sorry. - It's fine, it's fine. Tom. You're up early. Yeah, early bird gets the worm. I packed you lunch, it's in the fridge. Yeah, I already got it. I put a French lesson on your phone. Thank you. - See ya. - Bye. And so this is our main shared work area at Module 45. Now, usually when people start out, we recommend they just get a basic membership because that gives you access to all our communal spaces and amenities. We also have shared conference rooms on this floor, as well as printing and scanning facilities. And this is our workroom. Some of our members require more- a room for drafting, assembling prototypes, or just small scale production. Thank you so much. Okay, we'll see you soon. Okay, so gather around everybody. As most of you know, this is my last day. I'll still try to keep things short and sweet. You suck. Thank you, I love you too. So before I move on to my new life, I would like to introduce all of you to my new successor. The new managing director of Module 45, David Pallini. 'Pallini. - Pallini. - Thank you. I think all of us know who the real beating heart of this place is. Yes, Mr. Lauren Frank. I'm talking about you. I wish I had more than compliments and cupcakes to give you, but there it is. Take it away, David. Well, thank you for that, Alex. I, I got to say I have nothing but admiration for the heart of working staff and community members of Module 45. I am so excited about working with all of you to maximize your potential. - Hey. - Hey. Are you calling with good news? Well, you know, sometimes no news is good news, right? Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. They said they'd get back to you today, so there's still time. I have to go, but I'll call you back, Lauren. David. - You're looking well. - Thank you. So are you. Five years is a long time, but I can't tell. Well, thank you. I thought I would've run into you again at one of the enterprise conferences. No. That was, just something I did for grad school. Did you know that I worked here? You're just an added bonus. You and me are going to make a good team. If you don't mind, I think it's important that we keep things professional. I just don't want to give anyone the wrong impression. I don't mind. Makes me curious as to what the wrong impression would be. You're coming out with me tonight. My life is really different now. So is mine. - I should get back to the fro- - Name a place first. You're not leaving here until you name a place. Hi. Yes, could I speak to HR, please? Thank you. Hi, my name is Tom Anderson. I was calling to follow up about an interview I had there last week. Two weeks? Wow. Okay, great. Well, no, I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks have a grea- Yep, day, bye. You didn't really want to be manager anyway. - Are we going out tonight? - Of course. Where do you want to go to? - Hi. - Hi. Did the stairway smell like pee to you? It definitely smelled like pee. Come see what I'm making. Let me get a drink first. Okay. Show me what you got. Okay, so it's just underway. It's not good yet. But this is a model of Robel City Hall. Same curvature. I don't know what I'm going to do for the circular council chambers in the middle, but I'll figure something out. It's going to look great. I like how you have them organized by color. - What? - Nothing, you're just cute is all. - Hey. - Hi. You look really nice. Thank you. You better be more of a gentlemen than you were this afternoon. So, how was your first day? I don't think anyone's too thrilled about the new kid in town, but they'll come around. You're confident. I thought we were going to keep things professional. Why? I know you're attracted to me. Yeah, that's- It's not about that. Okay, I thought this would be an issue, Module 45 hired me instead of you, okay? That's a setback, but you should use this as inspiration to ask questions about yourself. I'm going to be my best self at all times. I can understand how it could come across that way, but that's not actually what I meant. You invited them? I bet you're good in front of an audience. - Hello. - Hi. You didn't tell us you were bringing company. - I'm Renata. - David. - Pleasure. - And you are? - I'm Nikki. - Nikki. - Hi, Miranda. - Miranda. Miranda is so thirsty, and so am I. Well, I guess I better get the first round. Sure thing. Don't hurry back. I can't believe that you brought me a man. I- He asked me out. I didn't know what to say. It's his first day. I'm trying to be polite, and so I told him to come here. I'm sorry. So he thinks this is, like, a day? So you didn't bring me a man. Okay, you can have him, because it's nothing. I just haven't had a chance to tell him about Tom yet. Okay. - Drinks are on the way. - Great. - What did I miss? - The new manager is such a dick. Huge dick. 'kay. Well, Mr. Manager, aren't you ashamed to be out on the town alone with a married woman? I'm not married. - So... - You practically are. That's what I was going to tell you. I'm in a relationship. No, I'm not even kidding. There's an entire sub culture of men who only date dolls. - Ew! - I know. I do not understand that. No doll at home for you then, David? - No. - What about a Mrs. Pallini? She up late drinking chardonnay waiting for you? No, no. There was, but not anymore. But I'm sure wherever she is now, she's drinking. Well, good for her. - Cheers. - Cheers to that. Come on, keep your back straight. Nice. Four more. Eleven, come on, push. You got five more in you. Come on. You really don't have to walk me home. I know. I do it all the time. I'm sure you do. David! David, don't. Give it to me. What are you writing? Not funny. Tell me about your young Adonis. He's an urban planner. I don't know he's between jobs right now. He keeps getting these contracts that are six months or a year, and nothing permanent. - So he's letting you carry him? - No. No, we're committed to each other. Sounds like a pretty sweet deal to me. Yeah, you're going to have to be nicer to me if you want me to stick around. You don't want me to be not nice. Tom's waiting for me. I'll see you at work. Hey. How's the city hall going? What's going on? Just wasting my life in front of a computer. - How are the girls? - They're fine. What's wrong? I lied earlier about the job then. I got an email from the city I didn't get it. I thought you were so perfect for that one. I'm sorry. I just thought with your background on the transit city strategy, they'd hire you for sure. - Well, they didn't. - They're crazy not to hire you. What are they thinking? I don't understand how the city works. Like, they fill these desks with dull, bureaucratic yes men. While the city is literally falling apart. You're starting to rant. It just makes me so fucking mad. Like, look at you. You're so smart, and adorable, and loyal, and funny, and- We should get married. You don't want to. No, no, that's not it at all. I was actually going to ask you once I got a job. - Really? - Yeah. I can't imagine being with anyone else. Me neither. So when should we do it? I don't know. I hadn't thought that far ahead, really. - I love you so much. - I love you too. - What do we do now? - I don't know. I think traditionally we're just supposed to kiss for a bit. - Okay. Yeah. - Yeah. - You cooked. - Yeah. - I didn't burn anything. - It looks great. Yum. - Sausage. - Sleep okay? No, I have sausage mouth. No, no, it's okay. I love sausage mouth. Wants some eggs with that sausage. No, no, I don't want eggs. I don't want it. What happened last night? Nothing. After you left with David, what happened? Okay, I am going to tell you something, but you can't tell anyone, okay? If you slept with the only single straight man in this entire office, I swear to god- Okay, first of all, that is really gross, 'cause he's, like, 20 years older than me. And second of all, I have Tom. Okay, I wouldn't for sure say that it's gross, 'cause I would for sure hit that. Okay, well, congratulations, now you can, because Tom asked me to marry him. - What? - Yeah. - Show me the ring. - There's not ring yet. I don't know, he got down on one knee out of the blue last night, and asked me, and- - Wow. - I know. It's crazy. But, listen. You really can't tell anyone yet, though. Okay. I won't. Okay. Why are you smiling? That was terrible. Okay, well, I'm a bit distracted today. Got engaged last night. Whoa, congratulations, man. That's huge. - Thank you, thanks. - That's big. Still got to squat, though. - Yeah. - Here, one last set. This time I want you to walk that core out, and push. Watch. - See? Give it another go. - Cool. Okay. - You're grinning. - I'm sorry. Stick your butt out. Good. - Hi. - Teacher, I think I might need help with my homework. Yeah, okay... - What's wrong? - I just- I don't know exactly what to do. Sure you do. Grown-ups always know what to do. Fuck me. Hold on. Sorry. Can we just- Can we come back? Okay, yeah. - Are you done? - Yeah, yeah, I'm done. There. Pull my hair. - Yeah. - Hair? Alright, I'm coming. Okay, hold on. Hold on, hold on, here. Cum on my face. - You sure? - Yeah. Do it. I'm sorry. Sorry, but I don't know if I can. What's wrong? I just- I don't know. I can't. - Sorry. - Aw. I bet you'd like it. Yeah, I do, I do, I like it, it's just- Yeah, I don't know. I just didn't want to kill you, or something. Well, that's kind of the point, right? Yeah, yeah. We don't have to do it if you don't want to. Do you want me to go down on you? - Maybe in a little bit. - Okay. - Hi. - Hey. Can you make sure these go out today? - For sure, yeah. - Thank you. Your welcome. Good afternoon, Module 45. Sure, if you email Module- then we'll get back to you within 24 hours. Thanks, bye. Why don't you introduce yourself when people call? Because they're not calling to learn my name. Sounds impersonal. Okay, well then I will introduce myself from now on. How about that? How about making decisions that demonstrate your value to the people around you? Follow me. Davie? Close the door. Lock it. Come here. You made a bad learner. When we were at the conference together. You know how to behave. Do you remember how to behave? Down. Good. Very nice. One two, one two. One two, keep the hand up. One, two. Hey. Hey beautiful. - Hey. - Hey. David, this is my guy, Tom. Hey. I'm her guy. - Good to meet you. - Yeah. I hear you're bit of a gym rat. Yeah. You know, gotta get big. - Where do you work out? - At the boxing gym nearby. Yeah. I used to go there. I won a few professional championships back in the day. I didn't make it into the nationals, but- - Wow. - Cool, yeah. You should show me some moves someday, or something. I think I might be in a different weight class. Yeah. Right now I'm not sparring yet. Well, if you're not sparring, you're not boxing. Yeah. Yeah, that's fair. So that's the guy they hired instead of you, huh? Yep. Is he like that all the time? Kind of, yep. I'm so sorry. I don't know why he does this. Your dad's texting me from the pub for updates. What's he saying? He wants to know if there will be any 'real food'. That's his words. Why didn't he just stay and help? He's trying to give me space. So, why is he texting you then? Because he likes to torture me. Lauren and Tom are just like you guys. No, we're not. Anyways, so I think this is doable. Tom's family isn't coming to town until the wedding anyway, so we're going to have about 30 people at the engagement party. I think that's going to be fine. I mean, it's just going to be intimate. I don't know. I'm worried that we don't have a wow factor. - You know, do we need a theme? - No. I feel like if you're just trying to impress people, it just comes off as being forced. Yeah, that's true. Okay, so tasks. Does everyone know what they have to do? We've only got three weeks. - Yeah, yeah. - Knock, knock. - Hello, ladies. - Hey. - Hi, how are you? - Hi. Well, this looks great. Hard at work. Yeah. You know, I've gotten a little carried away, but- Macaron, croquembouche. Am I seeing a theme? Hey, this is serious bridesmaid business. No interference. Yeah, you just open up that wallet and leave the rest to us. Well, truth be told, his wallet's a little on the light side these days. - Lauren. - It's true. So we should probably get going. You need to get to the store before it closes. Thank you so much, Mom. I really, really appreciate it. You guys know what you have to do, yes? Okay, amazing. Thank you! - Bye. - Okay, I'll see you soon, bye. Do you want some water? No. Are you okay? Are you feeling sick, or- I don't want to talk about it. No word on any of the jobs I guess, huh? Yeah, I just need to sleep. Are you mad about the party? It's fine. I'm sorry. Yeah, I just need to sleep I think. - You can sleep after. - Lauren. Your model is looking good. Are you going to do the arches on the square? I don't know yet. Where are you going? What do you mean? - I don't know. It's Saturday. - Yeah. Unemployed people don't get weekends. So you're going to the gym? Yeah, go to the gym, write some cover letters. Fine. Well, have fun. Thanks. So you're a student, you said? Yes. - Engineering. - Hey, no kidding. My sister's an engineer. She teaches too. What year are you in? - Third. - Amazing. I tell ya, I couldn't teach you to tie your own shoe laces, let alone engineering. Anyway, this is it. As you can see, it's pretty terrific. Really clean, and I just put some new tile in. Quiet neighbors upstairs, nice and bright. Yeah, no, it looks perfect. - I'm just gonna- - Yeah, yeah. Great water pressure. Yeah, and I mean, it's a steal. - How much was it again? - It's 1150. Which is amazing, you know, for this neighborhood. Yeah, for sure. Well, yeah. I'd love to take an application. Sure, I'll just grab one from the car. Take another minute to look around. - Thank you. - No problem. Hey. Hey. Have you eaten yet? No. Are you okay? Yeah, just my tummy is a bit off. Well, I bought some fresh ginger the other day. I can make you a ginger mint tea. And acetaminophen? You take that for everything. It's not even going to make you feel better. Please? Okay, fine. But I'm making you ginger mint tea. Okay. - Thank you. - Your welcome. See? There's barely anything left. Tom? - Where did you get this? - Don't worry about it. But how did you pay for this? I had a new card in the mail. - You put it on credit? - Which one's your left hand? No, I think it goes on my right. No, no, it's the left hand. Lift it up. Okay. Thank you. See, I knew you'd be worried about the price of the rings, so I decided to get cheap champagne to celebrate. Do men get engagement rings too? Is that- - Is that a thing? - I don't think so, but now I definitely want one. - Okay, ready? - Yeah. Sorry. I was shaking it up with the left hand. Come over to my place tonight. You want to fuck me twice in one day? That could be fun. No, I want to make you dinner, then fuck you twice in one day. I don't think I can. We can still have fun now, though. I can get sex anywhere. But I like you. Okay, I have to go. I have to go. I have to go. Hey, babe. Hey. Smells good in here. Yeah, got South Indian Dosa Mahal. Did you save me some pakoras? Of course I did. I got it all. There's tons of food. - Come join with me. - Great. You're the best. I'm just going to get a quick shower before I sit down with you. I just have been running around all day. I feel really sweaty, okay? Yeah, okay. Don't be scared. - Hi. - Hi. How's my girl? - Good. - Yeah? Yeah. When am I going to get mine? It's coming. Don't you worry. Yeah? Going to be big? It's gonna be so big. You're sure quiet today. I think somebody's getting cold feet. As if. Well, there's nothing wrong with changing your mind. Who said I'm changing my mind? I'm just- Well, see? They're perfect for each other. Hello? Hi, yes. Just one second. Hi, yeah, sorry about that. Really? Yeah. No, I'm fine. That's- That's great. That's great news, yeah. It's a great apartment. Yeah, thank you. Okay, bye. - Laura, hi. - Hi. Come on in. Sorry, it's a bit messy. It's fine. It's, it's nice. - Can I get you anything? - Sure. Do you have any whiskey? Yeah, yeah. You got engaged. It's not serious. How can a promise to spend the rest of your life with someone not be serious? - Do you want me to go? - No, what do you want? I don't know. I don't know. I think I know what you want. Take your clothes off. All of it. Can I get you some water? Sure. Can you bring me my clothes, please? Yeah. Hey, Nicky. Hi, yeah. Sorry, I, took off like that. I just, I went to the park to get some air and then I lost track of time. It was so funny running into Tom at the office the other day. He looked pretty much just how I pictured him. No, Nicky, that wasn't David. That doesn't make any sense. I'll call you back in a bit, okay? Fuck! I have to go. It was bound to happen at some point. David. Some people are just meant to be together. Hey, you coming to bed? Hi. I didn't think anyone else would be in this early. So I texted you 18 times last night. I know. I'm sorry. Guess you're sleeping with your gross boss, huh? You didn't think he was gross, like a week ago. Nikki. What? We met before I met Tom, okay? I'm sorry I didn't tell you. It was years ago at this conference in Seattle. And it was just this really short intense time, and it was over because he was married. I never thought he would end up here. So what? You're getting married. Have a little bit of self-control. Please don't judge me, okay? I am a person who loves you, so just talk to me. Okay... So this is it? Like, I'm going to be David's secretary for the rest of my life? Like, married to Tom until we get bored, and decide that we want a divorce? Like that's what my life's going to be? Can I do better? Better than what? Better how? Well, just better. I'm going to go back to work. Lauren. What are you doing out here without a coat? I just needed some air. Hey, I have a great idea. Why don't we go away to Niagara this weekend? Think about it. Why don't you meet me in the storage room in 15? Okay. - Everything alright? - Yeah. Don't catch a cold. Hey. What's wrong? I'm sorry. I can't do this anymore. Please don't make me chase you anymore. David. - I'm getting married. - No you're not. You're smarter than that. It's what I want. You don't know what you want. Lauren, is this a new draft? Hey. Guess what? I know this is going to sound crazy, but I quit my job today. What? What's wrong? Are you sleeping with David? He texted me like a half hour ago. Well, he's lying. He sent me a picture of you in that school girl's outfit. I- What's that? Don't stop. If there's an explanation for this, I'd love to hear it. We met years ago at a conference. - Okay. - And I'm sorry I didn't tell you about it before. Tom. - Tom, I'm really sorry. - No, don't be. You upgraded. I told him that it was over. I'm sorry. I don't know what I was thinking. I know exactly what you were thinking. Can we just talk about this? Please? Hey, the little buddy. What's up? - This guy is getting married. - I want to spar. We're getting there, man. - I'm not going to fight you. - I want to do it tonight. - I'm ready right now. - Have you been drinking? Well, if a fight started, you couldn't stop it. - I can stop it. - Yeah? Let's just sit down and- Go home, Tom. I'm not going to help you back up if you try to punch me again. Okay, so we'll just get you to sign here and here. Okay. Everything okay? Yes. Perfect. Great. I'm actually not feeling very well. Can I just use- - Of course. - Thank you. This is Nikki. If you know me, you know I don't check my voicemail. If you don't know me, then- I'm just getting a few things. I'll be just a little bit. I'm just-Stay as long as you need to. What happened to your face? I got in a fight. Where? Sorry, it just seems really unlike you. Yeah, well, maybe this is what I'm like now. I got you scotch and macaron. You can't gift your way out of this. Okay, I'm just going to make you a drink. No, Lauren. Can you please just cut that shit out? Okay. So I'm pregnant. I don't believe you. Okay... Here. What? What does that prove? Well, there- Why would I ever believe anything that came out of your mouth ever again? Tom, I wouldn't lie. Well, do you have anymore of those? - Tests? - Yes, tests. - Yeah, like, one. - Great, where? - In the bathroom. - Perfect. Tom. What, you want me to- yes, I want you to piss on one of those things, and I want you to show me, Okay. You're just going to stand there? Okay. - I can't with you watching me. - Well. Fine. Okay, give it to me. It's all wet. Okay. So. I mean, you fucked David too, right? So who knows? We always used condoms. I was really careful about that. Sweet. That's very sweet. What about other guys? No. It was just him, I promise. Said the cheating liar. Are you just saying that 'cause you think that's what I want to hear? No. It was just him and it's over. - Well, that's... - Good? Yeah, it's good. It's very good. Yeah, you just fucked the one guy, but you always used condoms, so everybody wins. What are you going to do? Are you going to keep it? I like the way our life is right now. - Bullshit. - I do. You'd make a good mom. You take good care of me. Well, you like being mothered a little bit. I don't need you to be my mom. But you like it when I pack your lunch, or make the bed, or, like, write you a shopping list. You like that. I hate that shit. But you ask my opinion about every little decision. Yeah, 'cause I know you want to be in control of everything. - No, I really don't. - That's such a lie. I hate that you have doubts about us. 'Cause I never had doubts. I hate that I'm pregnant. No you don't. On our third date, you were like, "I want to have two kids. " And I remember vividly because it freaked the shit out of me. - What? - Yeah, you don't remember that? No, I don't want one. I never wanted one. It's actually kind of a relief. So I'll make an appointment this week. So is there anything else that I don't know? I got my own apartment today. - What? - I'm sorry, I- How could you just make that decision without even talking to me about it? I'm sorry, I'm an idiot, and I was trying to be prepared. - Prepare for- - I don't know. So you just have this whole other thing? - No. - You need to go! - Can we talk about this? - No! You have your own apartment. You can go and enjoy that. But, Tom. Hello? Yes, this is Lauren Frank. Yes, I'll be there on Thursday. Yep. What if no one can be there to pick me up? Okay, can I call a cab? Okay. Yeah, no, it's okay. I'll figure it out. Thank you. Bye. - Hi. - Hi. How did you know I was here? Tom told me. Can I come in? Of course, yeah. I know it doesn't look like much right now, but- I'm cleaning and it's cozy. Well, I can sweep, or wipe, or clean the cupboard. Don't worry about it. I'm almost out of cleaning stuff anyway. But, yeah, have a look around. So you and Tom are finished then? Is that what he said to you? Well, you sure gave up quick. I don't think that's really what happened. Well, better now than 20 years from now. You've never like to change course midstream. Well, maybe you're growing up. Hello? Hi. Look, I know you don't want to talk to me right now, but my appointment at the clinic is booked for tomorrow. Who are you talking to? I need someone to pick me up. Why don't you call Nikki? Yeah. She wants a baby so bad. How about your parents? I'd really like it to be you. Tom? Hold on. What time? 4 p. m. Got it. I'll meet you there. Okay. Okay. Thanks. You okay? Yeah. I'm okay. How are you? Great, so your new place is on Runcie? Yeah, I was actually wondering if I can come home with you for a bit, because I don't have a real bed yet. Is that okay? Yeah. Yeah, no problem. Thanks. Are you okay? Do you want to- Is it okay if I go in the- Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I just think I need to lie down. - Here, I'll take that. - Thank you. Thanks. Hello? Speaking. Yes, okay. Yeah, I know. Right. Wow. Okay, yeah. That sounds great. Yeah, of course. I'll talk to you Monday. No problem. Hey. Are you- Are you having second thoughts about it? No. Are you sure? Yeah. I'm just so sorry. I know you have no reason to believe me, but- but I feel sick when I think about how much I hurt you. I want to say that everything's going to be okay. And that we can just sweep everything under the rug. But you're supposed to be my partner, and every decision you made you made without me. I just- You're, you're right. I know that I'm not supposed to say this because it's too late, but I really miss you. Lauren, I- I'm sorry. I should go. No, no don't, don't. Please just stay. I want you to stay.
