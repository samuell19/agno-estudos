There, that's good. Luckily we've got ace photographer Angus Snapforth to do our credits. He works longitudinally - - developing his negatives in Turkish-bath cabinet. So this should be just the job for him. And he has promised to make it snappy. 37 miles to the north, a bit east, and then up a bit lies Pinchcliff. A village perched under the blue welkin - -with it's own steam-driven cheese factory, a camping site, a local paper - -and it's own TV station. Open to all the winds that blow, where the sun rises above Lonetree Hill - -lives our cycle-repairer, Theodore Rimspoke. Must be awkward for a wretched cyclist with a blow-out - -to have to wheel his mount all this way to get our expert to fix it. Doesn't look as if business is very thriving, does it? It's only our postman, old foot-slogging Dan Hoofer, who makes his way there - - with the local rag and outstanding bills. His greatcoat has diamond tread. He's colour blind and has been run over a couple of times - - walks with a list to port and plays the big bass on festive occasions. Not much more to say about Hoofer. Cycle-repairer Rimspoke is an independent sort of bloke. More of an inventor than a businessman. Famous for his ingenious designs, - -such as pedal-activated combined shaving and raspberry-picking machine. He uses a copying pencil, instant coffee and his own patent telescopic ruler. Sonny Duckworth is the early bird personified. Hatched out in a weeping willow. A born optimist - - with muffler, felt slippers and indifferent morals. As Sonny puts it: The early worm gets the bird. Difficulties he treats as trifles, the impossible as a challenge. He's Rimspoke's right-hand man, counsellor, and friend. Lambert is a night-owl with hay-fever, a pillar of the rustic establishment. Run over by a reaper and got a crew-cut, short back, bushy by the ears. Found under the roots of a knotted oak and included as a Rimspoke resident. Lambert is a personal pessimist, and only really at home in Darkest Devon. And this is their home, standing in its own pleasant grounds, - -enjoying all the benefits of Rimspoke's ingenious gadgets. Well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop! Hi, Theodore! Look at this. This morning's post. Nothing but bills. Put them on the window sill with the others. Take a look at that super car! Look at that there Rudolph Gore-Slimey! -Do you know that fellow? -Know him? -Yes, I'll say I know him. -Do you know him personal? That there Rudolph, he was a kind of apprentice to me in my workshop. Then he suddenly packed it in and went to town. And now he's in big business, and a racing driver, I see. You don't say...? Big business, too? Beats me how that there Gore-Slimey - - got into the racing circuit? Competing with the best in the world, it says. Look! Smashing picture on the back too. Well, I never...! I might have guessed as much. Guessed? Guessed what? I wonder what he's got under his bonnet? So that's why Gore-Slimey was in such a hurry to go to town, huh? There's some skulduggery going on here. -More trouble brewing, I'll wager... -No, no, Lambert. Say, Theodore, what's skulduggery? Yeh, what's skulduggery? Well, we better get down to some honest work. Out with you, and set to work! When the call to work goes out, Brother, please include me out! Put your hat and coat on, Lambert! Come on! I see, doing your daily dozen, Lambert? I say, what's skulduggery, Sonny? Skulduggery? That is skulduggery! Oh. The north wind's blowing from every quarter today, Sonny? Lovely weather for working. I'm scared, I am. I don't like it when it's blowing from every quarter. -Let's get this contraption working! -All, right, just leave it to me. Computerised production of flagpoles for the Swiss Navy! That'll be 10, 75. Theodore is self-supporting, has his own electric power, water laid on - - and turns an honest penny on the side. Lambert remains a true romantic. Despite his chronic hay fever Lambert is conspicuously on parade - -whenever the sun shines down at Pinchcliffe. You'd hardly say life at Rimspoke's is one mad rush, but now and again - -a buckled wheel or a bent handlebar needs attention. The profits are hardly likely to cause repercussions on the money market - -still the three of them up the hill are content enough. Don't be frightened, Lambert. I'll switch the TV on, Theodore. -I don't like TV. -There's no bogeyman in the box. You never can tell, can you. And now for the news, read by pig farmer Archibald Skrimshank. This is usually pretty exciting. The situation is still very tense in the Middle East. Here... -Dang me sideways! -I'm scared, I am, Theodore. And now after the news, the World of Sport. We deserve a little extra treat tonight. I expect you'd like some dewrinkled raisins, Sonny? Help yourself, there's plenty for everyone. ... the current Motor Racing sensation, Rudolph Gore-Slimey. After winning his third successive Grand Prix. A few words, please. I came of humble stock from the little village of Pinchcliffe. Worked for a while in a cycle repair shop run by an eccentric rustic. Forget his name... Theodore... Theodore Rimspoke, I think it was. -Just hark at him... I mean to say... -Quiet now, Sonny! Humble beginnings, eh? Funny to think how easy it can be to get stuck in a rut like that place. But there was no stopping you? No, and I think my latest invention will revolutionise motor racing! -What invention? -This super retometric distributor. It raises the jet-injection factor to 1000 and the corradial effect by 1 12%. So that's your game! So that's your invention, is it, Rudolph? Funny, because here's the working drawing! What did you say? Has Gore-Slimey gone and swiped your invention? Yes, he must have collared it when he was working here as my assistant. Well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop. I never heard the like! I say, please, could you pass me another liquorice allsorts? Hush! We must listen to what Gore-Slimey has to say. Let me repeat, I'm prepared anytime, anywhere, to meet any challenge. Thank you for talking to us. We hope we shall soon see someone putting up a challenge. Now the Chairman, District Veterinary Surgeon Roger Uddersfield - -will present today's commercials. For guaranteed social success, use Brough, the swift-action hair tonic. -Switch off that commercial nonsense! -Remember the name, Brough! Recommended by egg-heads! -Don't let them fool you, Theodore! -Well, what's a bloke to do now? You're going to challenge! No, no, that'd be dangerous. -You pipe down, Lambert! -challenge him? I do have a little secret tucked away in the coach-house. Might be fun... Have a go! Could you get this completed, Gore-Slimey wouldn't need - - any driving-mirror! Just imagine Il Tempo Gigante! Rimspoke's reply to the Italian Ferrari! -Out of the way, macadamised snail! -Save your felt-slippers, Sonny. Well, shall we take a peep inside the coach-house and see what we've got? -Yes, let's! -Oh, no. There isn't much I can do with this thing here. It's in a sorrier state than I suspected. - You could soon fix this up. - Can't build a car without a penny. I haven't even got the nuts and bolts. We'll have to make a real killing! You could raise the wind, could you? A divinity shapes our ends. Stick'em up! -Hand it over! -Do you suppose I've got any money? This bloke's a poor as a church mouse! -This won't solve our problems. -Well, blow me. I'll be... Well, blow me. I'll be... That really hurt. Never felt such a pain before. Wouldn't never ever have thought it possible. -Move over! -Can't I have the inside berth tonight? -Don't we all have our places? -I never get the inside berth. -There's such a draft off the floor. -That's why I take the inside berth. Come on, pipe down! Well, good night to you, Sonny. Sleep well. Nighty! Sonny! Sonny! I say, Theodore? Has he gone out? I wonder why? Theodore's feeling a bit down in the dumps. I wonder if it is because he hasn't got enough money to build the car, Sonny? Think you'll be able to help him out, eh, Sonny? Lambert, it's only a matter of time - -before Sonny Duckworth of Sludgemere strikes again! I think I'll just stretch my carcase a bit more. Oi! String me up and stuff me in a hen-coop! Rolls-Royce 1905 model! Solid gold. Acetylene lamps. Gosh, transverse interleaved suspension. Silicon finish... What sort of a spooky get-up is that? He must be oozing with dough! Gosh! He's using dollar bills as fly-whisks! "Aladdin Oil"! He must be one of those oil sheiks! Perhaps we could funnel a little in Theodore's direction... Snickety snoo! How too, too snickety snoo. If this isn't tempting providence, I'd like to know what is. An ape, honestly. A genuine cross between a chimp and a gorilla. This is no joking matter! There should be plenty of money here for Theodore's new design. Well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop! Talk about an Oriental chick! And that fierce-looking money-grubber! Desperados! What eez the bizniz going on here? And the papyrus here? Theez eez no hieroglyphics. Theeze eez drawing of fast motor-car. Sensation! Theez car work of great genius. Where is the deesigner? Ali, ali, Emanuel Desperados, you fetch me theez genius! Thrown out? Not possibull! Throw out of the tent of Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza? Idiot! You stupid gorilla dam blockhead. Sonny's not the type to give up easily! At a pinch he gets his fertile brain - -work overtime and changes his line of attack. Once his mind's made up, there's no stopping Sonny. Ah, yes, the Pinchcliffe Gazette. That's an idea all right. An ad inserted here will have world wide coverage! My Spanish gambit eez successful! And it's Desperados to move. Your check easy to overcome. I just go through weez my castle. That shake you, eh? You theenk you vairy smart, no? I just move my keeng... And you get nowhere. Jallah. Sheikh Bonanza checkmated? You...! I no time to play theez silly game with stoopid ape. I prefer study drawing. Emanuel Desperados. Zees car ingenious! You! Throw designer out of my tent. Idiot! You beeg blockhead! Stoopid gorilla... So you're up early for once, Lambert? Yeh, gotta spend a penny. -Perhaps you could fetch the paper? -Yeh, I'll do that for you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a sensational announcement- -of the new racing car now under construction by Theodore Rimspoke. Pinchcliffe radio and Television roving reporter - -pig farmer Archibald Skrimshank, has all the details. Your on the air, Archie! It's all yours! -You're on the air. -Thank you. My, you people are inquisitive! We have it on the best of authority - - that cycle-repairer Theodore Rimspoke - - resident of Pinchcliffe, plans to complete his Il Tempo Gigante. Aha! There's the sooper-dooper car. What an advertisement for Aladdin Oil! Me finance Rimspoke and we win race! Emanuel Desperados, you drive me! We go visit genius! Emanuel, geev me completed contract! And you, my little turtle dove, you come visit Big Chief Rimspoke. Desperados, speed, queek, hurry! Hurry, hurry! You have trouble weez my Rolls-Royce? My car guaranteed! Hurry! Turn starting-handle! Bravo! Close zee door and get cracking! Hurry! We late! Now change gear! Caramba! Put her in reverse... there you idiot. Snitchery snoo! This is tempting providence putting all this in print. Theodore, it says in the paper. But where the dickens is it? -Theodore, the paper! -What does it say in the paper? It's all about your car. What? Let's have a look! Well, what do you know! Il Tempo Gigante? It's our car! How did that old picture get into print? Speed it up! Dangerous suspension bridge. Hurry! Speed it up! "Rimspoke has accepted Gore-Slimey's challenge." "Prospects for the Race of the Century." I wonder who's gone and...? So, that's it. Sonny has been at work. Yeh, Sonny has been at work. -Who, me? -Yes, you! -What've you been up to now, Sonny? -What've you been up to now, Sonny? -Just a few casual acquaintances. -Sonny's casual acquaintances, eh? They're apt to be a bit suspect. -I believe we've got something outside. -Sounds like it. Ze silence here is as profound as in ze desert. All people inside ze house. Emanuel, go knock up ze door! Would you open the door, Lambert? Someone's lost his way and landed here. Hurry along, Lambert, you like receiving visitors, I know. Lambert, man, don't be scared just because the door creaks a bit. Look at Sonny! Cool as a prize cucumber. -Give them a nice welcome, Lambert. -Yes, I certainly will. -Oh, gosh! -Salaam, salaam! May Allah protect thee and thy house. I have journeyed from afar to have a good squint at Rimspoke. Have no fear, friend! My chauffeur not dangerous, just a bit inquisitive. Very, very inquisitive! What sort of a jungle denizen might this be? Must have been smuggled in in a crate of bananas. You ze great bicycle-repairer Rimspoke? Yes, that's supposed to be me. Just step right inside. Brew up a pot of coffee, Lambert. Ah, you verry kind. We come to have pow-wow and you must listen to me. You Rimspoke brilliant designer. I Abdul Ben Bonanza have seen TV. I will finance your Tempo Gigante. I plenty moneys. You plenty broke. Well, maybe, but what do you want me to do? You use my oil and petrol. Ze best in ze whole world. She'll run on my own patent mixture. It would be fun to give it a try. Then pleez you sign theez contract. No, no, that's dangerous. -Do you think so, Lambert? -Of course you'll sign, Theodore. The offer of a century, from friends in distant lands! -Yes, pleez sign! -You're on dangerous ground. Don't listen to that Jeremiah. It's the chance of a lifetime. Well, it might well be. Bravo! So now pleez sign contract. We're heading straight for disaster. I know it. It's amazing what you can do with money! And a string of oil wells to back you up. Damn me if Theodore, the bird - -and our ungainly furry friend with the rucksack haven't really go cracking! Nuts and bolts, sprockets and spindles. Skilled hands engaged in precision lathe-work - -on rotary hydrogenic valves. With one vigilant eye cocked on the doings of willing helpers - -who run unnecessary risks without the protection of safety footwear. Work proceeds day and night. Mysterious fluids seethe and bubble in carboys, copper tubes and on hotplates. Theodore is experimenting with all kinds of fuel - - and hand-made thinly rolled body panels. Behind dark goggles Theodore is concocting a motorised carriage - -that is going to prove a sensation in the motor-racing world - - with technical finesses which entail radical innovations in the carburetion! Straight down the lightning conductor! Theodore has taken proper precautions - -against natural catastrophes and unforeseen punctures. Il Tempo Gigante features special tyres, with steel reinforcement. And seven layers of chicken netting welded into West Indian rubber alloys. When Theodore builds an engine, he doesn't settle for a mere two-stroke. He has drilled 12 cylinders and fitted them with concave linings - - rammed in a whole heap of high-tension ignition plugs - - linked to three-inch hyper-polished exhaust manuals. The finished product weighing 2.8 tons - -is impressive enough to shake any major motor factory to its foundation. It takes a full year to knock out a vehicle like Il Tempo Gigante. The day Theodore completed the prototype, - -the Bristol seismograph registered 7,8 on the Richter scale. Not a bad start for a do-it-yourself village enthusiast. Here's the late news. It has been confirmed that Il Tempo Gigante is ready for its supreme test. People in Pinchcliffe are confident that Rimspoke - - can show Gore-Slimey a clean pair of heels. We shall see when the chips are down. Time will show! Hi, you'll frighten them out of their wits! Sonny! Sonny! Who is it? Where is he? I can hear something real horrible. There must be someone outside snooping around. Theodore, there's someone snooping around at the dead of night. I bet it's someone after your car. I think we should hide in the cellar. What? In the cellar? -Night-time intruders? -Yes, I think there are people about. Our burglar alarm should deal with car thieves, and it's all set up. You go to the right, Sonny, on the other side of the coach-house, - - and I'll go this side. -And you keep an eye on the door. - I'm scared, I am, Theodore. I never been so scared. Never thought I would ever be so scared. Hush, someone's coming! That's Mister Gore-Slimey in the bag all right. Well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop! Gracious... So it's you strung up and dangling there, Lambert? I walked slap into it! That rope was intended for Rudolph, so you'll have to forgive me, Lambert. That put the skids on old Gore-Slimey. Sir Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza, Ladies and Gentlemen. We are gathered together to unveil Rimspoke's technical masterpiece - -which in tomorrows Grand Prix will challenge the world's racing drivers - -including Rudolph Gore-Slimey in his 12-cylinder Boomerang Rapido. We're gratified to have TV coverage today, - - in black and white and in choice colours. This event is being transmitted via the Pinchcliffe TV control panel - -designed by Theodore Rimspoke and broadcast nationwide... full stop. To mark this auspicious occasion we have invited one of our greatest brads. Despite an attack of the sniffles and the handicap of a mane of unruly air - - composed a laudatory epic: Hanbury Dapplenag! Greetings, mighty son of the desert waste On whose oil-wells your stupendous wealth is based By whose presence this ceremony is graced Our great inventor, thanks to your banking account Was able to sting you for a sizable amount And so in this week-end's great race we folk Can cheer on our hero Theodore Rimspoke Driving a very speedy vehicle which Bears the name of my modest shanty: The racing car Il Tempo Gigante! Thank you, Dapplenag, and may the Government grant your application - -for a three-year Bardic Travelling Scholarship. And now I shall ask Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza to rise and be upstanding. As funds from North Sea is not yet available for projects such as these, - -an overseas sheikh has generously stepped into the breach. This entitles him to the honour of unveiling this super car. Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza, she's all yours! I must ask the audience to retain your seats and your composure. We have TV coverage, and Theodore will now answer a few snaky questions. Today's news features Rimspoke's sensational Il Tempo Gigante, - -capable of challenging Gore-Slimey's GT Super Boomerang Rapido. Congratulations on the car! I must say, equipped with radar and all? That's right. In the event of fog and landslides. And to anticipate any concealed entrances. Could we have a rundown? Let's start with the cranking handle, which starts the engine up forward - -which in turn starts the carburettor - -which finally activates the rocket engine at the rear. -And then she really moves, eh? -You could say that, yes. And your top speed? With twelve cylinders and pure alcohol fuel - -and a gaggle of rockets raring to go, - -the old bus could hardly be described as a slowcoach. This job is designed with front- and rear-wheel drive - -as well as direct fuel injection slap in the jet - -using the cantilever method. And I've installed two speedometers - -serially linked so that one takes over when the other registers maximum. -And then this rotary wind-gauge... -And what about this brake-block? Same system as on a bike, but reinforced. -And what's this device? -That's blood type Rhesus B Plus. And Rhesus Minus, and a dash of blue blood if we should bump into a baron. -Or some other aristocrats. -Very smart. How about a look at the cockpit? No. That wouldn't interest the public. -Top secret, maybe? -Um... Well, it only remains for me to wish Rimspoke every success in the race. And now back to our comp?re, Dairy Manager Oliver Clapthwaite. Thanking you. And now our local band will conclude this ceremony - - with a specially composed march, Cantata Opus Two, - - by pig farmer Archibald Skrimshank. But first a special welcome to another prominent visitor, Emanuel Desperados. Private chauffeur, born right round the last bend of the Limpopo River. He has kindly consented to assist in the role of guest drummer. And now you can see Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza arriving in his Rolls-Royce - - driven by Emanuel Desperados. This great magnate is the owner of Aladdin Oil. There's an air of excitement here as we await the start of this epic encounter - -between the world's leading drivers. Now here's No. 3 coming up to start. The Italian Ruffino Gassolini, - -known as the Turin Daredevil, in his Bertone Carabo. No. 12 is the German Heinrich von Schnellfahrt, in his red Abarth 2000, - -the celebrated speed-merchant with glass-eye and monocle. Here's No. 5, the Swede Ronny Turnip Anderson, - -the Gothenburg Gogetter, followed by No. 8, the Argentine Carlos Fandango. The pampas playboy who ran slap into a wall and escaped without a scratch. An impressive array of horsepower. There's one question of special interest to fans: has Aladdin Oil acted wisely - -in staking money and prestige on a mere cycle-repairer? I imagine the people in Pinchcliffe - -will follow today's event with special attention to their hero. Let's have a closer look at Aladdin Oil. Rimspoke is just leaving the pits. What competition can his home-made design, Il Tempo Gigante, offer? It seems hardly likely that an prototype built by a cycle-repairer - - will go the full 25 laps of today's gruelling Grand Prix. But during yesterdays acceleration test Il Tempo Gigante showed a speed - -that ensured it a surprisingly good starting position. In the Snake Oil pit the director of the Dry Rot and Fungus Control Authority - -and ace driver Gore-Slimey is behind the wheel of his Boomerang Rapido. Rudolph Gore-Slimey has a string of victories in his car, - - with a great many hush-hush features. Only a handful of intimates know what's concealed beneath the black bonnet. His co-driver, in a cockpit designed on Spitfire lines, is Eleaser Cassandra, - - whose gift of second sight has proved invaluable in a tight corner. Less is known of Theodore Rimspoke's co-driver, Sonny Duckworth. Two novices to the track that should be watched with interest. In 30 seconds from now this impressive pack of speed-hungry roadsters - - will be streaking across the line in the Grand Prix of the Century. Five, four, three, two, one! They're off! The home-made contraption already seems to be in trouble. This is bound to be a severe disappointment to Aladdin Oil. The German Heinrich von Schnellfahrt in his Abarth 2000 has taken the lead, - -closely pursued by the Italian Ruffino Gassolini and Gore-Slimey. But now it looks like they've managed to crank Il Tempo Gigante into action. She seems to be firing on all twelve cylinders. She's off, and good luck to her. She's got a lot of leeway to make up. Not a very encouraging start for the good people of Pinchcliffe. It does really look as if Rimspoke is putting his best foot forward. Gore-Slimey in the lead followed by McQuick, the Swede and Gassolini. In a moment they'll be completing the first lap. Gore-Slimey has been passed by the Irishman McQuick. Here they come. Gore-Slimey flashing past still in the lead. With nine laps to go, Rimspoke is lagging 30 seconds behind the leaders. He has a lot of ground to make up. And now the Argentine ace Carlos Fandango goes into the lead. And now it looks as if Rimspoke really has got his horsepower harnessed. By my stopwatch he's pulled in as much as 15 seconds on his first lap - - which is sensational. We should not write off Aladdin Oil's chances yet. Gore-Slimey once again in the lead with Nos. 4, 12, 3, 8 and 5 in hot pursuit. Followed by Rimspoke. He must have put in a tremendous burst! Rimspoke's backers are clearly elated. The wee chappie now facing the camera is one of Rimspoke's rusty assistants. No doubt his first visit on a race-track. A popular feature in this tough competition. A message: Would the owner of the car registered PP 14U2 - - parked on a manhole outside Entrance C kindly remove his vehicle, - - as a Drainage and Water Board inspector is anxious to return home. We are just coming up for another lap. And Gore-Slimey is still in the lead. Amazing what Rimspoke is getting out of his car. Can he really keep going? Rimspoke has now rejoined the bunch, and Schnellfahrt answers with a spurt. Rimspoke's giving all his got, but seems to be having trouble with his engine. He's falling back. But he's picking up again - - and is hot on the heels of McQuick, Gassolini and Anderson. Going into the hairpin bend we get a ding-dong struggle - - between Schnellfahrt and Rimspoke. Out of the bend we have Gore-Slimey and Rimspoke. Rimspoke must have gone into a bit of a skid. His car seems a bit stern-heavy. There's a dramatic tussle going on, with Gore-Slimey still in the lead. And there goes Rimspoke, shooting into the lead. Aladdin Oil - - is leading in the Grand Prix! Il Tempo Gigante passing the stands with a clear lead. But it sounds like she is misfiring? The subsequent order is Gore-Slimey, Fandango, Schnellfahrt, Gassolini - -and the Swede Turnip Anderson. Rimspoke is clearly in trouble. His engine is definitely labouring. Gore-Slimey is coming up hand over first. Now he's passed him and is in the lead again! Things seem to be going disastrously wrong for Rimspoke and Aladdin Oil. Rimspoke is being overhauled by the rest of the field. My, what a pity. After such a splendid performance by this unusual vehicle! But that's the way things go! Snake Oil first with the German second. Just behind these two comes Fandango. The field's spreading out now. And here's the Swede leaving the pits after a spot of trouble. But Il Tempo Gigante is obviously in still greater trouble. She is being taken hand of by her team of mechanics. Now the German seems to be making a bid. Fandango breathing down his neck. The field seems to be massing for a thrilling attack on the leaders. Rimspoke is really back in the race! Talk about a quick start! Nothing like it since the Apollo went into orbit. Driver and co-driver must have been subject to something like 3 G! Once again Rimspoke challenges the cream of the world's racing drivers. This can develop into something truly spectacular! Looks as if Aladdin Oil have called on their second driver. What a gamble! Gassolini holding on to a slim lead, closely followed by the others. What about Rimspoke and his new second driver? It's obvious that Il Tempo Gigante is now performing superbly. Rimspoke is closing in on the field. But Gore-Slimey has pulled ahead and has a clear lead. Gore-Slimey has a commanding lead, and passes... there. The rest of the field is nicely bunched, with the German in front. But Rimspoke is now only seven seconds behind the German. Rimspoke, clearly full of go is only 15 seconds behind Gore-Slimey. It's going to be hard to predict the winner. Things are really hotting up. The German is back in the lead - -with the others breathing down his neck. Il Tempo Gigante is putting on a terrific spurt and catching up! It's a neck-and-neck struggle between Gore-Slimey and Theodore Rimspoke. Gore-Slimey is just hanging on to his lead, - - but the others are hard on his heels. Gore-Slimey and Rimspoke are leaving the rest of the field inexorably behind. Now what's happening? Gore-Slimey pulls away. Rimspoke is in trouble, with Il Tempo Gigante threatening to disintegrate. Gore-Slimey is starting on the last lap. But where is Rimspoke? There! He seems to have got his engine going full blast once again! Gore-Slimey can't be sure of victory. Both cars being squeezed to the limit. This is the last and decisive lap, and a final maximum effort is called for. This speed must be a terrific strain on chassis, engine, tyres, - -and the drivers themselves. Here things are really getting dramatic. Il Tempo Gigante is enveloped in smoke. Is she on fire? A highly dramatic finish! Rimspoke comes out of the bend with Gore-Slimey scraping his exhaust. He flashes across the line there! Winner of the Grand Prix of the century! In third place the German, followed by the Argentinean, Irishman and Italian. What a race, what a finish, and what a triumph for our village cycle-repairer- -and a sheikh who staked his reputation and money on his intuition. We congratulate Pinchcliffe, the native village of the three worthies - -who ensured Il Tempo Gigante such a sensational triumph. The cup and the laurels were just one more incident - -in the lives of Theodore, Sonny, and Lambert. They'll be back at their daily chores tomorrow, with petty quarrels, - -inventions and the manufacture of flagpoles for the Swiss Navy. -Tonight you have the inside berth! -Can I? -Is that really possible? -Take the inside when I tell you to! Goodness me! Snitchery pooh. -Nighty! -Nighty! English subtitles: Trine Borg
