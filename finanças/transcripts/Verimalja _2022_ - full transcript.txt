Thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them. EASTERN FRONT The Chalice of Blood We're too late! Pekka. Get Sergeant Bauer. Corporal. Damn it. Lieutenant wanted the priests alive. Myllykoski and Walter storm the building. Lahtinen and Koivisto go around from the right. No prisoners. We'll check the priests' bodies and leave. Stay behind me. Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Veikko! You two! Search. Go! Now Veikko's leg is bandaged. Good. I'll take the first guard shift. We'll leave in the morning. Major Collan, Captain von Ballack. Mission failed. NKVD had been tipped off. They had executed the priests- Surely you combed the perimeter? Captain. Inform the bishop. We lost Sergeant Bauer. He- Enter! Finns are pulled off the line. You'll be taken to Germany, and then back to Finland. Inform the squad. Lieutenant. - Also, congratulations. You are a sergeant now. Dismissed. We have been betrayed. The sacred chalice must be kept safe. We must disperse. Father Kazakov travels to Luga. Metropolitan hides in the monastery of ST Meinhard. We will stay here and die as martyrs, but the chalice will be safe. The emperor told of a vision where holy Mary touched the chalice. It is said that the Byzantine emperor Basil II had his last cup of the Eucharist before he died. Brotherhood... Look boys! Our new sergeant. Sitting here all alone. Waitress! But... proper war. Proper war! If a German's worth two Russkies, then one of us is worth five Germans... Crapper calls. Right? The priests in Ukraine have no chalice! Teutonic knights had received it year 1204, but lost it in a battle- Pekka! Shut your mouth. Well! Time for a beer! My treat! Private Koivisto. Captain! Do you know where your group is currently? They went to celebrate Myllykoski's promotion. I see. How is the leg healing? It's fine. It was just a scratch, after all. You'll get a recovery leave in any case. As you were. Did the papers reveal what the Russkies were after? Which papers? The ones Myllykoski found... Have you picked up some souvenirs from eastern Ukraine? What do you mean captain? You have papers that belong to us! I found these in the pocket of an NKVD officer after a recent reconnaissance mission. Why didn't you report it to me?! Captain, I meant to return them... Give it to me! Have you read these? Yes, captain. This information is strictly classified. Should we do something about it? Berlin has given me an order to continue the search. Excellent. We have good leads. Stalin's NKVD seeks to destroy the orthodox priest hiding the chalice, so make haste. I will reinstate major Collan. Do as you see fit. I'll also try to replace von Ballack. For that, we would be very sorry. Captain has been on the mission from the start. He is my dear friend. It is important to us that true believers be involved. I can send him to aid the captain. He has a military background. Paratrooper division 185 if my memory serves me? Father Stefano Lombardus, at your service. Can you leave within two weeks? Yes, he can. Very well. You are dismissed. The mission is assigned to Nordland armor division. You'll get a company without artillery. Estonian and Norwegian volunteers. You know what to do. I have to go. I will not suck up to some Finns! What are your plans after the war? I'll move to Tampere. And study, if I can afford it. What about you, Matti? Start a family. And work in some small congregation. Well, that suits you. Sergeant Myllykoski, Private Lahtinen. Help yourselves. We would like to re-recruit you into the Waffen-SS. You'd help us find the treasure mentioned in the Russian documents. It will be well compensated, of course. We are talking about a chalice, originally from Constantinople. Each of you will get 300 deutsche mark as a down payment. We know that men like you prefer the German military over the Finnish. No need for formal salutations, nor- Captain... My family awaits me in Finland. And we have enough money to live, without gold bars. No! I don't mean you to decide on it right away. I have granted you all a month long leave. Go home. Meet your families. Think it over. You can give your answer after you return. Thank you for the leave Captain, but there is really nothing to think about. I have a farm and a wife, and kids to feed. You study theology, right? This, if anything, is God's calling. You will have time to graduate later. When your leave ends, come to the recruitment office and tell us what you have decided. Kaarina! Hi. How are you? Well. Let's go somewhere more private. Nationalization of vehicles for military use ...obligated to turn in all warfare equipment... For fuck's sake! Is Kaarina still here? No. She went home from the church. That's alright. Let us have a chat. Just the two of us. Fine. Let's talk. Did you hear they took my car? Oh? I'm sure they'll return it- Yeah, right. Your father dropped by. Yeah... He's having second thoughts about Kaarina getting married. Damn geezer! Crooked as a parched pine! He's just making threats. Just keep working after the war and save. It's too late after the war! I was going to sell the car to build a house. So much for that plan. And now your father has promised Kaarina to some fancy-pants captain! Old man, just running his mouth. The Germans have money. Matti. Matti! Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings, from the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about. The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. For by thee I have run through a troop. Pekka! Matti is going with the Germans! No, he isn't. I'll talk some sense into him. - He's already signed the papers! Why don't you go and look after him? Maybe it's destined... You're already starting to sound like him. Well, is there a treasure? What is it? Has Matti signed a contract with the Germans? Yes, he has. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and in the hour of our death. Amen. Captain? Yes? Transfer orders for Lahtinen. The Pope entrusted this holy mission to the Teutonic Order. Everyone had to protect the chalice with their lives. The oath was meant to hold until the second coming of Christ. I found something fascinating in the archives. You, my friend... are the heir to Teutonic warlord Helmut in approximately the 30th generation. You can break your family's curse and bring back your honor. This is your chance. You truly are a prophet of God! Do not hesitate. Perform this holy mission with everything you have. I shall not ask the price! May the prayers of saints follow you. Matti. Why is there a priest sitting there? Lieutenant says he's a liaison to the bishop. Let's take a break! So, is the same girl still writing to you? Yeah, that's the one... Matti? - What? What's it like to be with a woman? Oh come on! And you chose an unmarried clergyman to ask that! Alright Matti... Happy birthday. From me, too. Well thank you! Matroyshka! Russian maps are a mess. Thankfully, you know the area- Lieutenant. Here is corporal Saar. Your new deputy leader. Sergeant. Welcome. Lahtinen, take Saar to the squad. Dismissed. My informants have tipped us about the village of Luga. They are hiding a priest who was mentioned in the documents. The chalice is there. Lieutenant. Line up. LUGA, SOVIET UNION We are interested in... a vase. Father Vasilij Kazakov left us one. Bring it! Out! Hurry up! Are there horses? Other people? Are there? God dammit! You think you can fool me? What? I don't understand. Put them in a line. In a line! Calm down. Calm down. What do you want? Tell me! Where is the real vase? That's the only one! Sergeant! Shoot everyone who resists, or doesn't talk. Matti! Do something! Sergeant, comply! Lieutenant! What the hell are you doing? Only the Red Army and partisans have horses. Withdraw the troops! Brigade Houser! Prepare to depart. Major... A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children, refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not. Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth. I'm thinking of buying an estate from Austria. Come visit me with your family. Captain! You will make sure this doesn't happen again. The whole operation was a complete catastrophe. And the bishop's breathing down my neck. The documents mention "holy Meinhard". That's a lead we could still follow. Take care of it. I have other things to attend to. Told you so. The lieutenant is a complete fucking lunatic. He'll probably kill one of us next. Pekka... don't conjure misfortunes. What are we going to do now? We wait. I'm telling you, nobody leaves here empty-handed.. Sergeant Myllykoski. You'll get two weeks' leave. Find out who "holy Meinhard" is. You have access to the university's records? - Yes, lieutenant. Any questions? What about Koivisto and Lahtinen? Pawns. We'll see about that! Lahtinen, go shoot a rabbit or a grouse. The provisions are late. Weren't you a hunter as a civilian? A farmer. - All the same. It's no different than shooting a Russkie. Comrade major! I am captain Merkurov. Welcome. Thank you. I would also like to inform you that Germans were to a nearby village, looking for a chalice. Did they find it? No. Good. We will interrogate the villagers. How was it there? Cold. Open spaces and rolling hills. And Caucasus? Beautiful. What about other village issues? Mother has been worried about you. That you don't have enough food and warmth on the front line. Is it true what they are saying, that Germany is losing? Who knows. LUGA, SOVIET UNION Pavel! The NKVD! What? What happened? They're looking for you. There, already! Go inside and hide! They're coming for me. We're looking for Kazakov and the chalice. The chalice? We gave it to the Germans. It was me! I hid father Vasilij. Bring him here. He left already! Pity for traitors is cruelty to the people. To Siberia with them all! Come away from there. I got it. - Get back! Captain. Myllykoski is requesting more time. What is your unit even doing? Vacationing? You've been in reserve for months already. I don't want to hear another word about the chalice! The Eastern Front could break at any moment. I'm proposing that the search be called off. Helsinki, December 11, 1943 Captain von Ballack. I found Meinhard's name in the archives. He was the patron saint of the first monastery in Riga, enclosed are copies of the pages. I'm traveling back on Wednesday. Give my regards to the unit. SS-Sergeant Myllykoski. Captain von Ballack! Your Excellency. I trust your trip was comfortable. Welcome. - Greetings! Koivisto! Patience, patience. Merry Christmas. Christmas! Christmas, Christmas... What's this? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. And.. Merry Christmas! - Thank you. What do you know... Santa did bring you something, after all. What would Lahtinen have preferred for a Christmas present? A train ticket to Finland. How about I ask the Lieutenant? As you were. Do the men have food and ammunition? Yes, Lieutenant. Is that from a girl? Yes it is, Lieutenant. Is the Lieutenant himself married? No. It's expensive. Carry on. Matti, since you're one of those clergymen, couldn't you read the Christmas Gospel? And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed. And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria... The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. Right... Who's shooting? Sergeant? For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock. And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy. Your Excellency. I have found out, that Meinhard's monastery is now the "Trinity abbey of St. Sergius", and is located in Riga. Metropolitan Sergei Voskresenski resides there. He knows about the chalice. We need to get the metropolitan. The metropolitan does not trust Germans. Perhaps some other holy man could gain his trust? Good idea. Father Lombardus could lure him to you. If he reveals the location of the chalice, you can promise him a passport to Argentina. Unit Collan carries out the abduction of Metropolitan Sergei... Stop! Drive diagonally across the road. Panzerfaust secures the road. The rest of you, follow me. Halt! Don't move. Hands up! Weapon on the ground. On the ground! Hands up! Hands up! Well now, luck would have it! Tell me what this is, swine! Major! Captain of the Germans. Call the partisans! Guard him! Help! Please! What's the matter? Partisans! Stay down. Out! Out of the car. Are you deaf? On the road, on your knees! Who are you? What are you doing here? What is this? A priest and catholic... What brought you together? Check their pockets. Eyes on the ground, both of you. Well well... what does the Father have here? You aren't even an orthodox! Catholic priest! What does the major need you for? We'll shoot you and leave your bodies here to rot! There. What was that? What the hell? You're throwing the Bible! Idiot! I just told you to hold it. Fascists! - Don't let them get away! Alert! What the hell? Hail Mary, full of grace... I beg you! Where is the chalice? If I tell you, will you promise not to let the partisans get me? I promise. In Estonia. Father Afanasi Serov. Now that went straight to hell. Nordenstam! Secure the car! Where were you?! Myllykoski, Lahtinen! Left! Comrade Major! Metropolitan? Dead, but we found this on him. In Estonia... The mission failed. Partisans had ambushed the road before Ballack's unit. That's unfortunate. I escaped, but the Russians got the Metropolitan. He's probably dead by now. May he rest in peace. Yes. But we had a chance to talk for a moment in the car. He said the chalice might be in Estonia, with someone called Afanasi Serov. Have you heard of him? I think so. Our Estonian contacts heard there's a pharmacist near Narva who is a former Orthodox priest... Marten Lapin Understood. We'll pay him a visit. Enter. Marten Lapin? Yes. Do you know a father Serov? Well... let me think. By all means! Are you quite sure you don't know father Serov? So you do know him. Point on the map. Major. Everything depends on this. We'll take no prisoners and neither will they. Questions? Lahtinen, Koivisto! Go and destroy that tank. The two of us? Enemy tank behind the clearing-destroy! Can't we get more men? What are you mumbling about again, Lahtinen? Dammit! Dammit... Flank them! Supporting gunfire! Now! Machine gun to the position. Left. Behind the building. Russkies! Go. Veikko? Veikko! Well done, Myllykoski. Pekka. Pekka! Lahtinen! Calm down- Lahtinen! Did you know that disobeying an order could be punishable by death? He does, lieutenant. Lahtinen. This is war. Corporal. Get some civilians for questioning. Yes, lieutenant. Father Lombardus. I had a strange dream last night. The Virgin Mary appeared to me and said: bring me the chalice. For fuck's sake! Lieutenant! Get something to eat. We'll take it from here. Soldiers. Interrogations will continue indoors. Machine gun. Horst! I wonder if anyone would notice, if lieutenant had a little accident. Artillery only at the front, to avoid hitting the chalice. Inform the artillery. - Understood! Where's von Ballack? On a break. And where... is Father Serov? I don't know. Really? Where is Father Serov? Where is Serov? Pekka. You cannot leave the group without permission. Pekka! Take cover! Take cov- The edge of the forest! To your positions! Where's Myllykoski? Went to find Lahtinen, lieutenant. Saar. Congratulations. You are now a sergeant. Keep the defense here and hold the positions. Understood! Bring the Panzerfausts. A local girl knows where the chalice is. Follow me! Go wait by the k?belwagen prepare to flee. Stay here. Tank at 300. Destroy. They're really trying to break through. Well?! Major, enemy is retreating! Search that gray building. I saw Germans. Gray building! Move it! Tell me where the chalice is or I'll put you down right now! Did you hear me! How unfortunate that Lahtinen and the lieutenant fell. Why didn't the girl shoot you? Perhaps you have some kind of a blessing. Captain! Look out! Stop! Run! Turn off the vehicle! Don't move or I'll shoot! Move it! Move! Connect to the artillery. Not here either... Well here you are! What do we have here? A barber kit? For... Grenade! What a... They've taken the village back. Back to headquarters. O my Lord. How long shall it be to the end of these wonders? What shall be the end of these things? Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it. And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them. Then took I the cup at the Lord's hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the Lord had sent me. If they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink! Medic! Here's another one! And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground The Lord of hosts hath sworn, saying, surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand. Myllykoski. The division commander has canceled the mission given to the battalion. Therefore, your service also ends. Here you are. Thank you for your outstanding work for the battalion. Have a safe journey home. Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive. Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. We leave these spouses and ourselves in your care. Take us once to home in heaven. Hear us through your Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Amen. I have canceled the mission. The chalice is very important to me. None of my business. If you help, I can arrange you to Argentina. I'm not your... well... A Danish SS unit will have to do. Thank you. May you be blessed, general Schr- The car must be returned this evening. Will you go to the town before that? Mm. - Father left money in the glove compartment. Matti. Are you going or not? Yes. I'll go. Father needs his car back. Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.
