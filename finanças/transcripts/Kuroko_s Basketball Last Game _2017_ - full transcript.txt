I come from America. I'm Kagami Taiga. I used to play basketball back there. My future dream is to be a NBA player. Nice to meet you, everyone. He's pretty different, isn't that great? Who is that? He just did a dunk! I've heard he's from America. My bad. Are you okay? Ah~ this makes me feel like crying... When I compare the basketball play here to the play in America... this here really sucks. That's what you just thought, didn't you? Wha-? No, that's not really... Forget it. There's no way you'll find that here. What's up with that? Hey, isn't that transfer student always alone? He apparently had some trouble with Basketball club. It's really too boring here. Someone, please chase my boredom away. Ah, so tough. What's up with this damned hot weather? By the way, why are you walking behind me?! Good morning, Kagami-kun. By the way, it's hot so please don't move away. Don't use people as a cover! Even Nigou is here too! Because it's my turn to care for him this week. Alex! Hello? America? I told him your request, but I'm not sure. Hm. I was definitely skeptical before I saw the video. But I'm impressed. I had no idea that there was such a talented player in Japan. Can I look forward to a positive response? I can guarantee that he loves basketball more than anything else. You're late, Kagami. I thought you were the one who wanted to see this. Sorry about that. Never mind, just hurry up and sit down, Kagami. It's about to start. Everyone, can you hear these cheers? This is Street Basketball's Super Exhibition Match's Stadium . Please take a look at this, the stadium is filled to its full capacity. And look at that, the ones who are going to play today is that super team... the street basketball team famous in America, in the world, Jabberwock! All members including the leader are only around eighteen years old! They are of equal match with the NBA players because of their astonishing performace. I wonder what kind of play Jabberwock will show in Japan? Now then, thank you for waiting! The amazing street basketball team that needs no introduction, Jabberwock, will start the exhibition match now! Don't you think it's exciting to watch such a teams match? But also, the fact that Kagetora-san is managing Jabberwock is pretty amazing, right? That's how Hyuuga and our coach even got their hands on those tickets. I wonder how it goes between those two. You can do it Hyuuga, use your clutch shoot straight into her heart! Are you alright? Yeah. Let's introduce the opposing team from Japan. There they are! Who would have thought that those people would gather like this? Team STRKY! Ah, there they come! There he is, Kasamatsu-senpai. Oh, Imayoshi-san cut his hair! Woah, they really came! Look, there's your brother! That Gorilla, what has he done with his hair? Higusu-san is there as well... Who would have thought he'd still play like that? Look, Sei-chan, it's starting. Even so, those players feel really nostalgic, right? However, something that he said makes me uneasy. Jabberwock? That sounds pretty troubling actually. I've heard quite some rumors about them around here actually. Especially bad ones. They are finally here! Team Jabberwock! And those are supposed to be our age? That's gotta be a joke. So the match will finally begin... I wonder what kind of amazing play we'll see? It's... Tip Off! He's got a strong dribble from the very start. I guess street basketball's tempo is really different, huh? What's up with that? It's feels like they're mocking us. What the hell, that's way too fast! I can't keep up! Amazing... This is way too much. It's common in street ball to provoke and tease your opponent. In fact, it's considered a high technique. If you manage it's pretty cool. But those guys are going way too far. Their mocking's far too obvious. Time's up! As expected, Jabberwock was overwhelming! Good play. Excuse me, that was an awesome play! Do you want to say something to your fans? I guess so... today's match made something very clear. Watching you all play makes me feel like puking. Everyone here in this stadium... no... everyone in Japan who pretends to play basketball... you should all just stop playing and kill yourselves. It's the same as how you don't play sumo with a monkey. However that's what we did... we played basketball with monkeys. First things first... admit that you guys are monkeys. Monkeys don't have the qualifications to play basketball. Wait right there you brats! Since you already came all the way here, stay with us a little longer. Huh, what the hell are you talking about? Papa? Let's have a revenge match in a week! If we still lose by then, I'll disembowel myself right here! But if you guys happen to lose... you'll make a sincere apology and peddle back home! What the hell are you saying, old man? Why would we have to play another match? Are you an idiot? Wait. I don't care about monkeys who stay quiet... but I can't accept monkeys running of their mouths like that. Oi, is he serious? I am not interested in an old man disembowling himself... but if he chickens out I'll make him pay in other ways. In one week... we'll make sure you'll never run off your mouths like that again. Wait-? Papa! A revenge match? What are you going to do with the players? To beat those kinds of players... it just has to be those players! When I suddenly got a mail from Kurokocchi I already wondered what was going on. But still if they're going that far to fight... It's not an option to just stay quiet and do nothing. Hah~ it's such a pain though... Even so I admit I'm rather looking forward to this. Who would have thought that we all would ever play again as a team? Yo. It has been a while. We're meeting sooner than expected, isn't that right? Murasakibaracchi? Hm. So it comes down to those greetings, right? Wait, is it just us then? What about those two? Ah... of course I called them too. The two who beat us all... Naturally they'll come. Hey. Sorry for making you wait. Good to see you all again. Kurokocchi! Tetsu-kun! Satsuki, can't you ever get a rest without doing that every time? So even you are here. Do you have a problem with that?! I heard that they'll be a few more players. Yes. They should arrive any minute now. Yo. Sorry for being late. Hyuuga-senpai, Takao, Takamatsu... Add a senpai to that! Hey, everone. Sorry if shin-chan gave you guys any trouble. Shut up, Takao. As expected there's still some pressure. Is it really okay for me to be here? Don't be so nervous. Of course we'll welcome you here. He read my mind and even more I had to be reassured by a junior! Is there any reason this guy's here? Is he supposed to be my substitute? It's exactly because of people like you that I was called here! Alright. Everyone's here now. Everyone should already know about the current situation. The only players who are capable of putting up a fight against Jabberwock should be you. In one week this team will be the ones to fight in the revenge match... this opportunity will never come again in your lives. For once the ultimate dream team has gathered. Whoa, look at that! Those guys being allies goes beyond just being reliable. Alright, that's the end! Tomorrow we'll face the real thing. Well done, Hyuuga-kun. So what do you think? You only have to see to understand right? As expected this team is amazing. I'm going out for a bit. Where are you going? It appears that Jabberwock is causing trouble in Roppongi. [Night life district] In Roppongi? Jabberwock? But why do you have to go Kagetora-san? To get those guys to stay I have to pay for them every night. And that all from my own pocket even... Our money?! So this fight also decides our future?! Kagamicchi... feel like playing a one on one before today's end? Sure. Sounds good! Make sure not to overdo it, guys. If only the others had a personality like Kise-kun, it would've been so much easier to get along... Right about that. Then here I come, Kagamicc- Hey... any idea where Tetsu went? I haven't seen him since Kagetora-san left. What's up with you today? Found a lost kid? What? What are you talking abo- This is the first time we meet. You-! Since when did you start following me?! My name is Kuroko Tetsuya. I'm one of the opposing players in tomorrow's match. Huh? Is that some sort of joke? I'm serious. What's up with that? You gotta be kidding me. I guess if this really is our opponent I might just lose by falling over from laughing. Just go home, kid. Your mother would be upset if she knew you were in a place like this. Why... did you say all that... that monkeys aren't allowed to play basketball? Is he some sort of idiot? Even I think that could be true. This already happened once before! Since it's Tetsu I'm not that surprised. Even so. I can barely believe this. I suppose Kuroko can really do things out of my expectations. For now let us hurry. It might be that from your perspective our play may indeed look like a monkeys play... but even if that were true... why would that mean that we'd have to stop playing? Anyone should be allowed to play basketball! Huh? What the fuck... you came here to say all that-? I was already wondering what a monkey would have to say to us. Kuroko-! Ouch, looks painful. Don't focus on all the unimportant stuff. I don't care about the opinion of a monkey. You bastards... what the fuck do you think you're doing to our teammate? It seems like you guys will be our matchups to tomorrows match. Some more amusing monkeys showing themselves, huh? I guess it doesn't matter anymore. What about fight right here? Quit it. Akashi-kun. I already understand. Since it's you... you'll probably want to settle this in a basketball match, correct? Yes, please. Then fighting here will be meaningless. Let's go. Treating Kuroko's injuries comes first. What the hell is up with that? You came all the way here... and will just go home with your tails between your legs? Aside from stupidity, you're also cowards? That's exactly why you guys are monkeys. In case you'll piss your pants tomorrow, we'll bring you some extra diapers! Shut up, you scum. You gotta just get ready to lose. We're gonna mop the floor with you tomorrow. After the match of Jabberwock a week ago here come the challengers. A dream team consisting of high schoolers! As reaction on the humiliating play from Jabberwock... a group of monsters appear to defeat them. They are Vorpal Swords! Despite everything that's been arranged last minute, this has been pretty well done. That's probably because every Japanese basketballer was made fun off by them... with all the attention from the previous match... everyone feels pretty serious about this. Make sure to win, everyone. The time for revenge is here! Vorpal Swords...! versus...! Jabberwock! Hey, babies, did you remember to bring your diapers? It's... Tip Off! I can't understand English, idiot... but those words are right back at you... we'll show it to you. He's fast! Faster than what I'd expect! Oi, you guys aren't the only ones who grew up with street basketball. Nice! Yeah, there no longer appear to be any problems. Oi, quickly give that to me. Come at me. Monkey filth. Too naive! Die! Huh? Who should? What is he doing all the way over there? Idiots. Today's ohasa fortune says that... cancer's at the first place... and I have my lucky item... how could I possibly miss? That has been the first quarter so far. The lead is by Vorpal Swords! Good job! You're doing great! Nice guys! But there's that... Yeah. It's true that for now we are in control... but... This is the first time that I see everyone so tired after only the first quarter. That only shows how strong the opponents are... It's exactly because of the team we have here... that I had no idea how far we could push ahead... but honestly it surprises me that our lead isn't bigger. Yeah. This is the best... the kind of opponents that make us push so far. Hah~ I already said so... I'm surprised, they are better than expected. Who knew that Japan had those kind of players? Yet even so... it's still only on the level of monkeys. Right, Silver? Yeah. It's finally time for us to show them... the power difference between us. It's time for the second quarter... Get them, Vorpal Swords! This is... Aomine against Jason Silver? A one-on-one with me... what's up with that? It's not like I specifically care that it's you... as it'll end the same with anyone. Impossible! He broke past Aomine-san?! Murasakibara caught up! He even got past Atsushi? That has to be a lie. Oi, oi... This is what happens when I get a little serious? Man, you monkeys are such weaklings. I even have to play carefully so that I won't hurt you. Even Sei-chan...? Despite that far distance he managed to catch up? What's with that jumping flexibility? Fuck, is he serious? I can barely catch up! What's that, is that really all you can give? It can't be helped then, watch me and learn! He jumped from the free throw line! And even more so this is... a windmill dunk with both hands?! What the hell's up with that? That can't be... that's not human anymore. Kagami-kun... Yeah. From the lane up into a windmill? Even I couldn't have done such a jump. Are you watching this, fucking monkeys? You will never be able to do this. This isn't the kind of power difference... you can make up for with hard work! Team Vorpal Swords Time Out! Right... this is bad. The other side also started showing their true powers. Murasakibara-kun... are you alright? Hm? I'm doing fine... but that guy pisses me off. I want to crush him. With our current five members... is the balance good but we have no power to stop Silver. I will change players, Akashi and Midorima are out. Kuroko and Kagami are in. Wait a moment... that means... I can see you've understood it pretty quickly as expected. We need Kagami to strengthen our inside. Kise, it's up to you to pass the balls around instead of Akashi. With your flexibility it should be easy to do. No, that's not what I meant...! if it's about that guy I'm enough to take him on- Murasakibara. Follow the coach's orders. You can't win on your own right now. Huh? For now at least. You can disobey me if you think I'm wrong... but for now coach's judgement is the best decision... even more... between a team's victory and your own victory... which one is more important to you? You've already experienced this before, isn't it? Time Out has ended. Hah, that kid from yesterday really showed up. Ah? For real? Also, even if we restarted we wouldn't have noticed him. Just how weak is he? This guy... is he using more power now...? is what I'd say... but if he's using his whole body to push me back... that only means that he won't be able to respond to my speed! It's no use... It's not over yet! Kagami! What's with this guy? To think he's able to jump at the level as me! But for you to think that you alone are enough to stop me... idiot... go to hell! Who said he was alone? It's only logical that that idiot couldn't stop you on his own! I'm only here to help you out because there's no other way. What's up with that?! It's two on one! Nice! They stopped him! Ha? What's that? There is nobody ther- This guy-! When did he get over there? The counterattack starts now! Nice pass, Kurokocchi! Good, now go! They returned fast! I won't let you escape this time! ...Silver? He's still over there? It's now two on two! He's going to pass? No... It's three on two! They scored! Go Kagami! Nice! Keep it up! Kise's pretty good as a point guard as well! Everyone's finally getting in synch! Oi, Kise! Why'd you pass to that idiot? Because Aominecchi was being marked! You got a problem with me scoring?! Of course I do! I think... Oi Silver, I understand that you were surprised but at least return to defense faster. You could've stopped that shot, right? Enough of this, hurry up and give me the ball. I'll crush them to pieces. Ah, I hate this. Just so you know I'm only co-operating with you... so that we can win. Can't you guys ever just stay quiet and go with it?! Give it to me, Silver! I'm free! Huh?! There's no way I could be defeated with only this. I don't need help from anyone! Sounds about right, I figured you're not one to pass. Single cell creatures are so easy to understand! You fucking monkey...! Aomine-kun! Ah, even though I wanted to fight them myself... well, whatever. Here, take it. Even though no-one was there, where did he come from? What the hell's been going on here? Nice pass as always, Kurokocchi! So now.. it's finally my time to shine! He made it! Vorpal Swords scores yet another basket! Aomine-kun, your pass was poor. I was scared for a moment. Eh?! It doesn't matter if it went through, right! No, I'm pretty sure it worked because of Kuroko. Mine-chin sucks... Shut up, y'all! At least say something good about my dunk anyone?! End of the second quarter! The difference is now only two points. The teams are almost even! Those fucking damn monkeys-! I won't let this happen in the third quarter! Silver. What, hu-?! Be quiet for a moment. Anyway, don't worry about it. I'll let you rampage in the third quarter. All what needs to be done is breaking their defense. I'll just give you more openings to score. I couldn't really follow it... but at least for now it seems they stopped fighting. Honestly, their playstyle and pressure are better than ours. They are just being annoying. That's all. Alright, everyone. You did well in the previous quarter. Let's continue this in the third quarter. But don't let your guards down... they haven't shown yet the depth of their full strength. The real battle will start from now, got it? Yes! Even so that Nash Gold Jr. ... he was able to pacify someone as aggressive as Jason Silver. What kind of play will he bring furthermore? The second half starts with the third quarter. Go, Vorpal Swords! That bastard, Nash, he seems totally different from before! Kise can feel the change as well. What the- what was with that pass? The ball went to a free player in the blink of an eye! This isn't just about the level of speed... I couldn't even see the ball! There was no time delay. Don't worry about it, get one back! If it concerns godlike passes... we also have an expert here! They caught up with Kuroko and Kagami's combination play? Fuck! Crap, I won't make it on time to help! Wait... is he serious?! Don't tell me that in the first half he wasn't even using his full power?! Referee time out! Murasakibara. Crap, this is getting bad... This kind of feeling... there's no doubt about this! He's on a whole different level of the wild than us! Even monkeys like you must finally understand now... No matter what you try with those hands... a little pass of mine and it's all finished. If you try to stop Silver, the others can't be stopped. If you try to stop the others, you can't stop Silver. It basically comes down to this... We're on a whole different level than you. From now on every moment... we'll give you a taste of what real despair is like. The score difference is beginning to get too big... Are they really unbeatable... even with the Generation of Miracles... we cannot win? Please, someone stop them... at this rate the score is getting too big... Anyone? Team Vorpal Swords, member change. So now we're finally changing members... isn't something we should have done way earlier? That's right! Akashi should be able to put his teammates into zone together with himself through his passes. If all of them could go into zone right now... That's something we can't do. Even if we were to do just that... it wouldn't last till the end. So does that mean that whatever we do...? No. There's still a way. It's true that all of you... can't go into the zone together right now. But in order to stop the point difference from increasing... we need to stop their attack. First of all, I'll be the one to mark Nash. And about Silver... Somehow... they seem different from before. I never would have thought that I'd form a double team with you. Well... one never knows what kind of turn life'll take. Don't drag me down, alright? Sure thing. That is the Zone he started on his own-! That's Perfect Copy! What the hell are you acting like you've already won? We're just getting started... with the real match! They have amazing pressure! What the hell is going on with those two... their movements from a moment before and now are totally different! Awesome! Those two form the strongest double team! There's no way they can keep the ball now while trying to break through! You! You bastards sure are annoying! Good going! Perfect Copy is amazing as always... for a second there it looked like there were two Aomine's! Those guys... what's with them? Even their breathing is in sync! So it's true that Akashi-kuns special pass doesn't work because of him? Ankle break! That speed with that form? What kind of crazy shot is that? Dai-chan... Ki-chan-! Your passing time is too slow. It would've been easier if it had been a bit faster. Even faster than that? Could you have taken the receive? Of course I could, idiot! Ah, what's with this? Tears are coming out so easily, lately... Keep it up! Aomine-kun! Kise-kun! You fuckers... I see... it's true that his defensive range is large... it's just that... those things don't matter when I'm the one who passes! He went from the back step into a fade away shot! Even that execution was so smooth. A three-point basket? Somehow... don't you think that double teaming is a bit much? Aominecchi, can you let me handle this guy alone? Pff, fine then. Then I leave him up to you. What? Isn't that a first? Are you sure about that? I just said you can have him! But if it's too much we'll change back, y'know. Eh... fine. Fine. You bastard... what the hell are you up to? Nothing much... Don't you understand by paying attention? I'm saying that I alone am enough to take you on. You... fucking trash! Is he...? Can it be? Wait you two... No matter how you look at this, aren't they taking this too lightly? No, in fact it's the opposite. It's not that they're being careless. They're doing this to keep up the bluff. The calculation of Murasakibara's covering No.6 and No.7 to keep them in check was wrong. That's why the score difference became so big. Not to forget that such a double team takes a huge toll on those two. At this rate the both of them will run out of stamina before the end. Kise realized this and made a decision. In order to save Aomine's stamina... even if it'll mean he has to sacrifice his energy... he'll take Silver by himself. That idiot. He's losing his cool so easily because of him. Go Kise! Like I'd let you...! I'll crush you! Hah... I never imagined I'd take on a role like this. Then again I won't doubt my course if this is the only way. I won't just sit still and do nothing. I'll show you! Oh it's Kise, what's up? Well, um, about that last match, they really were the worst, weren't they? So I was kind of curious how you are doing. What, it's about that? Right now I'm having lunch with Okumura. I played basketball against you all... I couldn't let myself get low every time because of the difference in our skill level. But even so, it was frustrating. Even more important than the fact that Strky was made fun off... the basketball we've played with all of you... was being mocked by those bastards. Imayoshi and the others said the same thing as well. I heard that you guys will gather up, right? Then I'm asking you this one thing... win. Not as a revenge for us but to prove the kind of basketball we've all played so far. What the hell?! Impossible! Even if Silver wasn't fully ready he dunked over him?! Kise... are you...? You did it! You're in... the Zone! So does that mean he has Zone and Perfect Copy? Is such a thing even...? It won't last long... but this I can guarantee... right now... Kise is the strongest player standing on the court! From now it's their counter attack, huh? Can you hear me? I need a favour. Yes. I understand the situation. I figured it was about time. My playstyle is a bad matchup against Nash. Lend me your power. I need your eye. I don't mind. But are you sure about this? I was their enemy before. If we can't work together, it'll break the team balance as well. Go Vorpal Swords! The score is slowly catching up! It's okay. They've changed. Nobody thinks of you as their enemy any longer. On that same note... It's the same for you, isn't it? I understand. Let me fight too. For the sake of teams victory. Kise-kun! Vorpal Swords, member change! Ah, damn. I wanted to finish with a last shot, but I can't even move a single millimeter right now. Hah. This is so uncool. What's that about being uncool? You've done well enough. Akashicchi. Leave rest to me... Ryouta. Akashicchi? This atmosphere... don't tell me? So in the end he runs out of gas, heh? Well, of course he did. There's no way he could keep up those kind of moves forever. It's unfortunate. And so the situation is back as it was. The result doesn't change with that kind of recklessness. Thanks for all the meaningless hard work. It's not back to before nor meaningless. Ryouta has done more than enough compared to the rest of us. However, you should be more worried about yourself. Huh? What was that? I'm absolute. Lower you head. Out of bounds, black ball. Impossible! He managed to cut Nash's pass! This is Emperor Eye, so that means... Looks like the ball went out. I guess I'm still a little rusty since it's been a while. Well, no matter. Next time I'll take it. It's the other Akashi. I heard that he might switch but still... Seeing him as another person again still gives me the chills. But... when he's on our ally Akashicchi is the most reliable player of them all! Was he able to read my pass despite the lack of preliminary motion? No, that can't be it. It's not that easy. Then, can it be...? He changed back? And even without any hints beforehand. However... for the current Sei-chan it makes no difference. He was able to react to that as well? That just now convinced me... like I thought he possesses them! Those eyes! You won't get through! Move. This is an order... and you should remember this... my orders are absolute. Go Kagami! Stay calm! Restart and do it over! They're double teaming Midorima?! Are they cautious about the three pointers? They don't have a coach and can't take any time-outs, but despite that they can still think about the situation and work with that. It's hard to accept but they've got a good head. But that only means... that one of them will be free! Return it! Nice shot! Amazing! He just passed out the range of the Emperor Eye. Could it be... that they figured it out? That was nothing more than a forced shitty pass. This is annoying. Vorpal Swords Time Out! For now, Midorima's being kept under some control making the outside scoring low. And on the inside is Silver stopping us. At least the opponents are worried about Akashi stoppings Nash's passes, so their offense is suppressed. Basically both teams are at about even. In order to create a momentum we need a deciding play. We have one. Our shooting guard has not been compromised yet. We can clear gap with three pointers. But as I say that... it's still a gamble. Do you understand, Shintarou? I see how it is. But I'm not one to like gambles. I always prepare myself to the fullest. Of course today as well. My shots will never miss. They want to clear the gap with three pointers in this situation? How will they do that? I... kind of understand what they're saying... To be honest, I'm not happy with it. In order to win they'll have to succeed... but if they manage it'll be kind of annoying. What does he think he's doing? The first time we ever had to made this work... I have never doubted his passes. But the same is true for you... Akashi! Can it be...? Please give me a break... flawless. What the hell? That one was out of form... it won't go in like that! What?! How did that go in, damn! Don't mind it. It was just a fluke. We'll just stop him the next time. To think that he's the one to say such a thing to me... he looks all fired up. Looks like he definitely won't miss any of his shots today! Even more... we're scoring three points every time. We'll catch up soon. Even though they said that it was a gamble... What the hell. They're doing even better than I expected. It's hard to admit it but... the one who make the best partners... are those two. Steal! Return! There it is! Three consecutive three pointers! At last there's only a three point gap! To be honest I'm surprised. You are the first person I ever met who has those eyes... the same as mine. What did he just say? The same eyes? Does he mean... he also has the Emperor Eye? But don't get the wrong idea. The mechanism behind them is similar but between my Demon eye and your Emperor Eye... mine's on a whole different level. As he's facing Akashi's Emperor Eye how can he be so calm? Akashicchi. You say it's on a different level. Don't underestimate me! He'll do a back pass to the right. He managed to fool even Akashi despite his eye... that means there's no doubt about it. He has the same eyes as Akashi and can see the future! Just now, what was that? He got past Sei-chan... and even more, after that he... This is really bad, who would have thought that Nash would have the same ability as you? No, it's even stronger than that. Looks like you realized it after that last play. Your eye can see the future of one person at a time, but my eyes can see the future of allies and opponents at the same time. Which means I can see the complete future of this game. Even a god couldn't get past me. *Cue evil laugh* What?! That was exact same as Nash did before. He went on the offensive without any hesitation. As long as we play one on one it won't matter how many players' future you can see! Before I was just a bit surprised, but it won't happen again! Those are totally the movements of street basketball. Who would have thought that Akashi could do such a thing as well? It's a fight of two players who can see the future. The remaining time is only five minutes! Great! Go back! Counter attack! As long as I can see there's no way you can score. When both of us have the same eyes but I'm still able to pass and you can't... it's easy to understand why. I'm just stronger than you! Akashi got ankle break! What?! Basket counts. One throw. Hey, come on, get up. It's not like you to sit down. Hey, about him... can you leave him to me? You want to take Nash as your opponent? No, that's not it. That job is meant for Aka-chin only, right? There's no way he would lose to such a guy. But I guess it's hard even for Aka-chin right now. So for now just leave the offense and defense to me. To win against Silver in a one on one, honestly speaking... You have a low winning percentage. That's why I said it's okay. The other side would still come at me when they know what I'm doing right? It's better than just letting Nash play however he wants. Even though it's a lame tactic I'm okay with it. Riko-chin or Sa-chin, can you give me a hair tie? Thanks. By the way what was that about 'our biggest chance to win'? Even if we can't win, we just have to win even if it kills us. What's wrong? Come at me! Wow, he has enormous strength! No, it's not enough... he still can't push him away! They want to push for a one on one against Silver. Those fools! Such a thing is meaningless! Damn, that's not it. It wasn't enough. More... I need more. That's wrong! You need to lower your waists even more. And lift your upper body. Ah, annoying... you're being too loud... In order to unlock the fullest of your power you need to use the correct form. Murasakibara, you still waste too much power. By the way until now you've only played basketball with your instincts, but in that case couldn't Kagami do it better than you? You piss me off...! If keep this way up then you won't even be able to budge the guys who are bigger than you. A person like that doesn't exist. Besides, the Winter Cup's already finished... hurry up and retire. Oi, brat! I'm gonna kill you! If you just get stronger and get to play with even stronger teammates then you'll definitely meet a guy like that at some point. Someone who has more power and skill than you. A person with more power and skill than me, I'll definitely defeat him. Murasakibacchi... I've seen such an expression before. Someone who looks like he enjoys facing off against stronger opponents... That's just like Kagami-kun! How is this possible... But for what I'm gonna do next, you won't be able to keep up! Don't underestimate me, monkey! So amazing! Even though I thought that it's impossible to win against someone like him, but even so... I just remembered something... Speaking about body size and strength no-one is his equal. I think that in the bottom of heart he had the wish not to hurt anyone... so he was restricting himself. But when he's fighting against someone like Silver who's alike in terms of size and strength... for the first time... he doesn't need to hesitate to use his full power and now he can finally enjoy himself to the fullest. Two blocks in a row! Go! Someone like me is afraid of a guy like that? No way that's possible! No-one here is stronger than me! No way in hell I'll let that happen! How is it? Not good.. no doubt that it's broken. Don't fucking joke around! You did that on purpose, didn't you?! What? That was just an accident. A coincidence, y'know? But that's what it comes down to in a showdown, the person who stands at the end is the winner. You bastards... Trash. Out of my way. Oi, be careful! Like I care! I just want to beat the hell out of that trash. You shouldn't be reckless. Murasakibara-kun, please switch with me. I already said that I-! It'll be fine. I'm just as mad as you are. We'll definitely win this. Hey, Silver. That kid is glaring at you. Fine, I get it. Then the rest is up to you. But in exchange... Make sure you'll beat them to pieces. I will. No longer a man to man field but now a three to two zone, right? Now that your center's no longer there. No surprise about that. Even so it's still meaningless! Like I thought it's still no use! With my skills as they are now! With the defensive zone weakened, it's up to Kuroko to stop the side attacks! I've got this. Even at that distance from there? What kind of person can do that... Because those guys managed to pave the way until now... in the last five minutes, I can go all out without holding back! At this rate he'll...! You monkeys! From now I'll do everything in my power... to crush trash like you! Like hell we'll lose! Kagami stopped them! And he even got the ball! There's now two of them! The double ace awakening! Testuya will assist us in offense against the two of them. But if there are any chances in the meantime... I'll pass to the outside. Don't miss it, Shintarou! Stating the obvious. I'll shoot them anytime. Time to put an end to this. Let's go-! Against Jabberwock! You damn monkeys! It's no use. You can't get past Nash! Wrong. I no longer need to do that... since we have now our sixth man on the court! Fuck! His reaction's quick! What the-?! He made it! And he even scored from the back?! That pass was great teamwork! Those fuckers... Suddenly their passes come through and more than that they've now got even two in the zone. Fuck! When did he-? What's with that strange form? It vanished? Nice! Phantom Shot! Those idiots... to make such a mistake at this time. But I'm different. How much of a living hell do you think I had to endure so far? In this kind of situation there's no way I'll let myself be cornered! A crossover?! And at that speed! You won't get through! Is he serious? What a player! He dodged a three and even got through Kagami like that?! Nash Jr. still has a higher level above this play? Come at me, monkeys. I'll put an end to you. It's clear that his movements just now are completely different from before. He went from a highly skilled street basketball with quick moves... to a refined and orthodox basketball style without wasting any effort. Most likely this must be his true form... the full power of Nash Gold Jr. That may be but this ain't the time to get scared. It doesn't matter how strong he is... that's not a reason to lose against trash like them! They scored! Back to the 4-point difference! But we're out of time...! There's only thirty seconds left! Please! Do something! Crap. One more. There's not enough time left for one. If it becomes a 6-points difference again at this time... they won't be able to catch up any longer. If they can't be stopped from now on it's over. It's pointless. You can't stop me. I'll finish this with one last shot! Akashi? This is goodbye. What are you talking about? You should already know this. Nash is strong. If this keeps up we'll lose. But when I saw his barrier eye I was shocked. I realized there's another possibility. It's not that emperor eye is weaker. It could just be that it's still incomplete. The reason is simple. It's because the both of us got separated. That's why I'll disappear and give everything back to you. In order to be a complete self again. I have proof as well. When a perfect vision to pass on the court... and Emperor Eye to see the future combine... it'll definitely give enough power to stand equal against Nash's eyes or even stronger. Is that only the way? Don't worry about it. To begin with I was an existence that shouldn't ever have been born. I was able to play with everyone as a parting gift... that means more to me than everthing else. Thank you. Nash! You are able to see the future of allies and enemies alike... but that's really all that you're doing. If it was me I would use it better. If I could see the future of allies and enemies as well... I would search for the best pattern through this all... as I'm able to look for the best... future I can see! I've been waiting for this. This is a complete comeback. Nice! A 1-point difference! Impossible. This can't be. This guy has now the same eyes as me! Akashi-kun? Can it be that right now you're...? Indeed, but that's something we'll talk about later. First there's something we definitely have to finish. Let's win, for sure! This is the last battle! Fuck, because of these mere monkeys... but winning is a different matter! There's only 10 seconds left and in order to win you have to go on the offense. I'll just pass the ball around and that'll ensure our victory in the end! Even as we've come this far... is it still impossible? He got it! Go! Kuroko! Don't get too cocky! You monkeys! Like we'd lose! We'll definitely win! If it's only you I can crush you in an instant! He isn't alone. Don't get the wrong idea! The ones who'll win are us! It's over, Nash! Make it! Take this! Jabberwock! Time's up! Vorpal Swords wins! Well done, you guys, really. For today this treat's on me. Drink, drink! Ummm.. we're high schoolers though. Then take a cola or juice or something, anything'll do! Anyway, just drink! Could it be... that Riko-sans father is... the kind of person who spends money easily? Just leave it alone please. Damn. Even though I was forced to come here against my will. They have a lot of snacks here so I don't mind... By the way, is your arm alright? This sort of thing's fine with me. Speaking of... Is this really okay, Akashi? All these snacks? What are you talking about? Didn't we use to eat these kind of snacks back in Middle School as well? Right, right! It's better for these kind of moments to eat as much as we want to enjoy ourselves. Isn't that right, Seirin? Y-yeah... But is it really alright for us to sit here with everyone else? Kagami mentioned that there was something he so desperately wanted to speak with us about. What could he want to talk with us about? Who knows? Kagami, what is it you want to tell us? Everyone. I've made up my mind. I'm going back to America. What? No, no, no... Does that mean you won't want to play with our team any longer? No. Thanks to Alex' guidance, a strong basketball school over there has scouted me. I want to play over there, with my eyes set on the NBA competition as goal. This must be a joke, right? Kagami? But this is so sudden! Kuroko! Say something as well! Could it be... that you already knew? When Alex-san called him about it, I was there as well. Are you okay with this? Yes. As long as Kagami-kun wants this, I'll do my best to support his decision. Kuroko... I'm truly sorry about this. Between my dream and all of you I thought about it, I thought it over 'till morning light, but even so I still want to go to America. Geez, you idiot. I have absolutely no idea what you're going on about! You really expected that we'd hold you back without supporting you about this? If you've really thought this through to the point of crying it's enough. Go and do what you've dreamed about. We'll all root for you. Go and get 'em, Kagami. Everyone... So that's what's been going on. You guys! We already thought something was off how y'all acted. Eh... Kagami? You're going to America? Why the hell are you going? Then it's impossible to have our revenge match. Hold on a moment. When did you ever claim that right as the first in line? Well, I suppose that everyone has a lot they want to say about that. We'll support you decision. Do your best, Kagami. Even so we'll miss you. From the start you played against us and challenged us so far to a higher level. I'm glad that we met, Kagami Taiga. For all of us since we met, you've been our best rival. And our best friend. Thanks, guys... Just so we can send you off nicely, I have a little suggestion. Today we've been able to play with Kagami on our team in the best match in Japan for the last time. But for Seirin who didn't get to do that today, don't you think it's a bit sad to end it with that? Why won't we play one more game right now? Team Seirin against us... the Generation of Miracles. It's alright. I've already managed to secure enough uniforms for us all. Can you see the future for such a thing, Akashi?! But about that... will you be alright? You're not too tired? Don't underestimate us. We'll be able to play one more game like this easily, y'know. We've rested enough already. And if we get too tired during the game Takao and Takamatsu surely can play for us. Hah~ so troublesome... Murasakibara, it's fine if you won't play like that. If you're talking about my arm it's no matter. I'll just use this arm not that much, right? What- of course you're not supposed to damage yourself further! Looks like it's decided, then. We'll ask Kagetora-san if he'll be our referee. Sorry, but no way I'll hold back against you all. I'll pay you back for our last game. Well then, shall we start? Last Game, let's go. It may have been a short while, but thank you for everything. We're grateful as well. Kagami-kun... Please do you best. I believe that you'll fight your way into the NBA competition. Of course I will. Watch me as I'll beat everyone and become the number one in no time at all! Thank you for everything you've done up until now. Yeah. I guess I should've come a bit earlier. His hands are really small for basketball play. But with those hands he... passed all those times. I am a shadow. Kuroko! Just before, I was lying. When I said that I'd definitely become number one, it's true that when I think this through my confidence wavers, wondering if I'll be able to do it alone... but! we all fought against Jabberwock and managed to win so then I realized something... those guys are crazy strong. Without you I wouldn't have been able to win against the Generation of Miracles! That's why, when I think about going overseas, I doubt myself whether I can do it but then when I think about how you never gave up, no matter how impossible... Damn, what am I even talking about? Anyway! You're my shadow! I've been able to come so far as I'm now because you were with me! The one who has to be thanking the other is supposed to be me. Thank you, Kuroko! Wondering about how many obstacles you'll meet... it's only natural to doubt yourself! If you'd really been able to play there without any trouble, it'd have shocked me. You didn't have to go so far as to say that! If all you need to overcome those obstacles, please do that. Hey! But even so, if it's you, I have faith that you'll be able to come out victorious in the end! From here on, I'll be forever your shadow! Yeah. Goodbye, Kagami-kun. I'm going off! Also half of the credits go to the translator of the Extra Game manga which I used as a guidance at times. Other half minus /x/ of the credits go to who uploaded this beautiful sharp version including the creative subtitles, Kiyosubs! I humbly thank you for your efforts for making Kuroko no Basket Last Movie available in anywhere-not-Japan. So that leaves /x/ points for me. Not bad for someone who has never subbed before and will definitely probably hopefully never feel the need to do this again. *nod nod* Don't forget there are after-credits as well in glorious Marvel style! Make sure to spread the love. Spread the seeds~> [Jenix out] Ah~ there he goes, taking off for real. Now there'll no longer be a chance for him and me to play, huh. Not that I care or something. That's not exactly true. I'm going. To America. Huh? You're going to cheer on Kagamicchi? No way I'd do that, idiot. I'm going to play in the NBA basketball of course. Huh? When are you gonna to that? I don't know when yet. But I'm definitely going! By the way, Mido-chin, what did you mean? I could ask you the same. All of us will forever keep playing basketball, isn't that right? Midorima has the right idea. Kagami only changed the stage on which he plays. As long as we'll keep playing basketball, we'll meet again.
