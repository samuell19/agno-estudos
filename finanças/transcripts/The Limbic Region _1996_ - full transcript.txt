[Lucca] I never really thought much about rain before. All I ever thought about were the things around it. Postponed baseball games, umbrellas, wet shoes. But now, each drop on the window seems like a miracle. Perfect, beautiful, one of a kind. Finally, the difference between the trivial and the important is crystal clear. Yet now, the difference is no longer important. [people arguing] [woman] I'm sick of you yelling at me! Dad. If you're in there, happy birthday. We're leaving some presents by the door. Love you, Dad. [Lucca] Man is the one animal that knows he's going to die. [car doors closing] Yet we carry on paying the rent, planning for the future. Playing the game as if we had an eternity. Oh, you're so perfect. [talking indistinctly] [man] What? [woman] Who the hell is that? I don't know. -[woman screams] Oh, my God! -[gun fires] [man] No! No, no, no! [firing continues] Oh, man, come on! We gotta get out! [Lloyd chuckles] "Happy birthday, Dad." Hey, Jon! Aw, look at the sleeping beauty. Jon! Jon! Sorry, I forgot about your birthday. I heard you've been in a hospital. You okay? Yeah. I heard you're dying. [lights cigarette] [sighs] What can I do for you? I want to take a ride with you. Ride? What do you got in mind? Just talk. Talk? Well, why not? [engine starts] So, tell me, how's the family? How's the hardware business? Oh, I don't know. It's a living. Same thing day in, day out. Nuts, bolts and backed-up toilets. Uh... I don't mean to sound morbid, but how much time did they say you have? A week, a month... Who the fuck knows? Some benefits in dying, though. Get to smoke all you want. And morphine... [chuckles] It's a world all its own. When warm blood soaks into something, no matter how long ago, it changes it. Asphalt, dirt, cement. Gravel. [coughs] It changes everything. [coughs] [indistinct chatter over radio] Probably been dead three or four hours. Rigor sets in fast on thin people. [Brownlee] We had a 300-pound guy last week. He must have been dead for two days, and he was still warm. I never seen nothing like this. No sign of robbery. No rape. Nothing. We'll preserve the scene best we can. Dust for prints, take some photos. We'll take it from there. Looks like somebody killed them just for the hell of it, no reason. There was a reason. There's always a reason. [woman on PA] Dr. Hassman to Obstetrics. Dr. Hassman... All we got to do is walk them through the first few steps and then head back into the city. It's no big deal. You'll be at the ball game, if it isn't rained out. Yeah, right. I'll be asleep by the third inning, but I do love coming to the hospital. Candy stripers in those cute white outfits. -First time I've ever seen this. -[Lucca] What's that? These tattoos, made with a knife. Doesn't make sense. Why would a kid do something like that? [Lucca] Skinny. Yeah. The kids called him "beanpole." Real nice kid. His father owned the bait shop up on Vernon Road. Might have been trying to look tougher, impress the girl. [clears throat] It just doesn't seem right. One pair of panties, white... [Lucca] Get some clamps. ...covered with black hearts. It's a 9mm XMC. Hollowpoint. Same as the others. [retching] [Lloyd] Hey, Jon, you all right? Huh? Was it like this? Her leg was bent. She was such a good kid, real popular. I thought you didn't know her. Well, not really, but it was a small town back then. She used to work at the Tasty Freeze. She would always give you an extra scoop on your sugar cone for free. I'll never forget it. Half of Verde Dero showed up for the funeral. I'd have gone, but I couldn't get out of work. [Lucca] "Quick, said Bambi's mother, run for the thicket. Bambi darted away. He heard his mother's hoof beats behind him." [imitates hoof beats] "Then another roar from man's guns. Terrified, he ran faster. His mother was nowhere in sight. He sniffed for her scent. [sniffs] Nothing. 'Mother,' he called. 'Where are you?' The prince buck of the forest appeared beside Bambi. Your mother can't be with you anymore. She's hurt. She's going to be okay, but she just has to get some rest." Dad, that's not how the story goes. The hunters killed her. Yeah, she's not just hurt, she's dead. Who's reading the story? Yeah, well, just read it right. Yeah, read it right. I'll try. [jazz music playing] [Ann] Did it work? Yeah, I think it did. [sighs] At least their eyes were closed as I snuck out. Hmm. A couple of kids were killed today, up near lovers' lane. Yeah. Yeah, I heard about it on the news. Remember when we used to go up to Twin Peaks? [chuckles] You never did figure out how to get my bra off with one hand. All I could think about was one of our girls up there, making out with some kid. You know, Jon, I think you'll have got whoever did it before the girls are old enough to date. Don't you? [Lucca] "I am the murderer of those two kids at Red Rock Springs. I want you to print this letter on the front page of your paper. If you don't print this letter by the afternoon of Friday, the first of August, 1974, I will go on a killing rampage Friday night. I will cruise around all weekend killing lone people in the night, then move on to kill again until I end up with a dozen people over the weekend. By the way, I read in your paper that a big city dick is looking for me. Good luck. You're going to need it. Me: two. You: zero." Look at the signature. I take it you're the big city dick he's talking about. Yeah. But it ain't no big thing. Well, this is a first. I mean, I can't remember any other killer pulling a stunt like this. Taunting the police, giving information. Jack the Ripper did it. Look at his Ns. Yeah, so what do we do? I mean, uh, if this guy is for real, we've got ourselves a big problem here. How do we know the whole thing isn't a hoax? I'm not going to let some nutcase put the whole city into a panic. We've got a responsibility to our readers. Yeah, right. Got to sell those papers, huh? Nobody could figure it out. [coughs] He shot half the windows out of the car at close range, missing the kids. Then he shoots five times, and hits the girl in the back in a tight circle... In the dark. Running on gravel. [coughs] One hell of a shot. Or a lucky son of a bitch. Huh... What? Well, maybe he didn't want to hit them at first. Maybe he... Aw, I don't know. Maybe he wanted them to see him. Maybe that's the only way he could get off. Get off? Nobody wanted to admit it. These were sex crimes. I thought he never touched them. He didn't. But I'll bet he returned to the site over and over again, reliving the moment until he couldn't get a kick out of it. Then he went out and did his thing and then started the process all over again. Very good. His car was important to him, the only way he could move amongst normal people. He held his sickness in where he could feed off of it. The car kept it in where the outside world couldn't see or feel it. Made him feel protected. [Lloyd] You amaze me with your insights. Let me ask you something. Are you all right? What do you mean "protected"? From what? From whom? It looked like it was the world that needed to be protected from him. That's... That's how it felt to me. That is far out. [car approaches] Whoa. Get rid of that. What if it's the cops? Just relax. That was close. Now what? Who is it? What does he want? I don't know. What if it's my dad? Where's the dope? I thought you had it. Where's the dope? Brian, I'm scared. Hey, man, what do you want? He's coming closer. Oh, my God. He's got a gun. [gun fires] [groaning] [moaning] [man] Hmm. [gun firing] [chatter over police radio] [Lucca] "Dear Detective Lucca, this is the murderer of the two teenagers at the Simpson refinery and the two kids last Christmas at Red Rock Springs. I'm a little angry that you chose to ignore my last request. Perhaps now you'll print what I tell you to. To prove I killed them, I shall state some facts which only I and the police know. One, brand name of ammo, Super X. Two, nine shots were fired. Three, the boy was on his back with his feet to the car. Four, the girl was on her right side with her feet to the west. The girl was wearing patterned slacks. The boy was also shot in the knee. Western ammo. When I fired the first shot at his head, he leaped backwards at the same time, thus spoiling my aim. He ended up on the back seat, thrashing out very violently with his legs. That's how I shot him in the knee. To assist you in your investigation, I've enclosed a composite drawing of myself. If you don't run this drawing in tomorrow's paper, bad things will come. Me: four. You: zero." [Fredricks] The guy's keeping score, for Christ sakes. A third of the guys on the force look like this. Don't dismiss the fact that this guy could be such an egotistical maniac that he'd send us an accurate drawing of himself. [Brownlee] Why's he writing to you, Jon? Who's he going to write to, Steve McQueen? He wants me involved. [Payne] Okay, okay. Aside from his artistic skills, what else do we know about him? A lot. He kills on weekends around bodies of water, lovers' lanes. No robberies, no sex. He's one hell of a shot. [Payne] We're going to have to release the letter. You guys better get ready for a nightmare. [newsreader] Homicide police would make no further comment after releasing the sketch. Detective Lucca is a highly decorated police officer. [both] Mommy, Daddy's on TV. Is he? Just a sec. I'll come see. Huh? What have we got here? Oh! It looks like... What are you guys playing? We're just rolling these down there. [Ann] Well, you know... We've got the real thing. [Ann's father] It must give you the creeps, huh, Jon? Having that guy writing to you? [Ann] Guys threaten Jon all the time. Honey, dinner. We get a dozen Christmas cards from San Quentin every year. We even got one from the guy who shot Jon last year. -Hmm. -That was fun. People don't want to go out at night. Business at the store is down 70%. -Here, dear. -Thank you. -More candles, hmm? -Look, can we just please stop talking about this? I'm not going to say it again. That sauce needs more red wine. I don't know. This feels different, and I don't know why. [Ann] Look, I don't want to talk about this anymore. I want us to have a very nice family dinner. Promise? That's when he started writing to me directly. I remember. You couldn't pick up a paper or put on the TV without seeing you. Everybody knew who you were. He made you a celebrity. I was just doing my job. Everybody was waiting for you to catch him. It must've been very frustrating. [Brownlee] Man, ever since you talked the Chief into running that damn drawing, we've had calls from everybody and their uncle, saying the Scorekeeper's their mailman or their neighbor. [chuckles] Or even their husbands! I mean, we've had 200, 300 husbands so far. Yeah, but no mothers. I'll bet you 10 bucks this broad says her kid looks just like Scorekeeper. He was the first serial killer. Before him, there was no such thing. There wasn't even a label. We had no idea what we were dealing with. That's right. Serial killers are a dime a dozen nowadays, huh? Bundy, Gacy, Kemper, Ramirez... Not to mention Dahmer. Seems like they come in bunches, huh? Yeah, if you can get a book deal or a motion picture made out of it... You get your picture on the cover of Time. Really. They always make these guys out to be such geniuses. David Berkowitz, Son of Sam, remember? [chuckles] Some criminal mastermind. He got caught 'cause he parked in a red zone while he was committing a murder. [chuckles] They all get caught in the long run. Sometimes it takes a while, but it's not because they're so smart. It's because the cops are so stupid. [tires squealing] Pow. Right between the eyes. But the young ones, oh, they're the best to eat. Done much hunting lately? No. My eyesight isn't what it used to be. But I think about it an awful lot. [woman] He says I made him the way that he is. Can you believe that? You can't make somebody the way that they are. They got to be born that way. [Lucca] What kind of car does he drive? He's got a bunch of them. I can't tell them apart. He keeps them up at his trailer. [Brownlee] What are these for? Depression. But he'd never take them. Well, let's see, Mr. Warden was arrested because he was following around some cheerleader, really harassing her. So her boyfriend and a couple of his buddies confronted him after school, and he put them in the hospital. The judge sees no previous offenses, so he pops him on probation and court-appointed counseling. [Lucca] That sounds pretty smart to me. Ah, he's very intelligent in a basic sort of way. I think he might be a developing sociopath. [woman] You know, you can never let him know that I called you. He talks about those murders all the time. He's... He's obsessed with them. [Brownlee] That doesn't really mean anything, ma'am. And he looks just like that drawing. Ah, it's quite rare to encounter the genuine article. The complete lack of any real human emotion. Nothing but a series of what we like to call masks of normalcy. There's a theory developing that sociopathic behavior is controlled by a specific section of the brain. It's called the limbic region. It's the primitive part of the brain that generates and controls what we like to call human emotion. Do you mind if we keep looking around? Look, I don't care what you do. Okay? He's your problem now. Is he capable of murder? I don't know what he's capable of. Man, open a goddamn window. Smells like something died in there. [Lucca] You take the inside, I'll take the out. Thanks. I wish I had some gloves. [Brownlee] Hey, Jon... [Lucca] What a diet. Excuse me, what's going on here? I'm Detective Lucca. I know who you are. I saw you on the news. I have a search warrant here for your trailer, your vehicle, and your person. Why? We're investigating a murder. Murder? Okay, go ahead. I'll check the car. I've written this sentence. Rewrite it, please. Five times quickly. One after another, please. Five times? Why? Do the best you can. You think I'm the guy that killed those kids? If you don't mind. I can't believe this. I don't think I can do it. I thought you caught that guy. If you're not involved, this'll prove it. You can go. What's with the dead animals in the refrigerator? Oh, I'm working on a degree. They're part of my scientific research. I have a permit for that. [Lucca] You like to hunt? Sometimes. Just a hobby. What do you hunt? [sighs] Depends. Uh, raccoons, deer... Whatever's in season. Have you done any hunting lately? No. I've been studying for finals. Thank you. [Brownlee] Do you mind taking a ride with us, Mr. Warden? Wait a minute! I thought all I had to do was write what you asked me. Hey, Lloyd. What the hell... I can't have cops coming in here. It don't look good. She said you scared the shit out of her. She didn't give me the details. She was too afraid to. Look, my mom's afraid of the milkman. She said you were sick, that I should watch you. She wouldn't say that about me. She loves me, and I love her. That's exactly what she said to me. Now, why would your mother tell me something like that? Because she... Because she's sick. You met her. That's why I live with her. Because I have to take care of her. How about the incident with the cheerleader? That was self-defense. The girl smiles at me, and the next thing I know her boyfriends are ganging up on me with baseball bats. Where'd you get those? Your mother. She says you're obsessed with the murders. I'm not obsessed, I'm just interested, that's all. A lot of people are. I know the strain that you're under, with everybody depending on you to catch this nut, but I'm not a killer! This is all just a big mistake! No match. It's not him. Sorry. He couldn't have disguised his handwriting? I've never seen it done. It'd be very difficult, if not impossible. [Lucca] Shit. [Brownlee] I want to bust this guy as bad as you do. He's weird, that's all. And there's no law against being weird. I met the killer today. His name is Lloyd Carl Warden. I couldn't bust him. I couldn't do anything. He's smart. He lays this fat mama's boy trip on everybody. What makes you so sure it's him? I saw it in his eyes. He knew me. What do you mean, he "knew" you? When I confronted him... I knew, he knew. I know he knows. When did you start smoking again? About 4:30. Jon... I know this is hard on you. But it's not the only thing in the world. He's making me feel responsible for the kids he's killing. Well, that's crazy. If it's him, he'll screw up. It's just a matter of time. That's what you always say, right? Time. Hmm. How's your mother? She died eight years ago. Hmm. She was sure some piece of work. Please don't mock my mother. I loved her then. I still do. Really? Even after everything she said about you? [railroad crossing clanging] What did you say to her about me? 'Cause the truth is, she left right after you talked to her, and I never saw her again. [train whistle blows] I need some air. You really are a bastard. [professor] Lust murderers are distinguished from other kinds of sex-related homicide offenders by their involvement in the mutilation of the victim. According to studies, there may be displacement of the breasts of females, postmortem attack of the genitalia, insertion of objects into body cavities of the victims, and sometimes the consumption of human flesh and blood. It's hard for me to believe that Lloyd Warden would know anything about a murder case. I mean, he's one of our best students. [professor] In their own minds, they've planned the event, but when the opportunity presents itself, they have no time to escape detection. Detective, look, I'm sorry I'm not your man, but if you keep following me around, I'm going to lose my job, huh? [Lloyd] It's all about survival in the jungle. You swallow your saliva all day long, but if I ask you to put it in a glass and drink it, you won't. Why? It hasn't changed. Something deep inside you says no. Wild animals... They don't mutilate themselves or attack their offspring, they don't masturbate or get ulcers. They don't form homosexual bonds until you cage them up. Then all hell breaks loose. Like out there. [car horn honks] Funny, isn't it? How people override their instincts and let their minds tell them what to do 100 times a day. [prostitute] Hey, baby. Come on over here... [Lloyd] Where you going? [car door shuts] Where you going? What's this? Jon, your little girls must really love you. What a lovely little birthday present. [gun cylinder clicks] [man] I need it now, man! [man] I need it now! This little piggy went to the market. -This little... -Hi. My name's Doris. What's yours? You want a date? I give great head. I'll suck you off for 30 bucks. We can get a room in there. How about a hand job? Twenty bucks, and you don't even have to get out of the car. Hey! [groans] Hey! What are you doing? Hey, you're hurting me! [groaning] Oh, let go of my arm! You're hurting me! Ow! How was that for a hand job? [man] Get out of here! [tapping] What was his problem? No problem. What did he want? What they all want. What's that? To be taught a lesson. He was just begging to be taught a serious lesson. Stifle nature, Jon, and that's what you get. A serious lesson. Yeah. That's why society is always able to absorb a little more of what you would call senseless violence. And what would you call it? Perfect sense. Think about it. People disappear every day, and the world goes 'round. And what's one less face on it, right? And nobody would miss that drag queen faggot. [man sniffles] [driver] Want me to turn the heat up? Sure is crazy out there tonight. There's 30,000 doctors in town for some big convention. Huh. Man, with the money those suckers make, you'd think they could tip better. I got my boy to support. [man whistling theme to Big Valley] That's quite a catchy tune. What do you call it? My dad used to fish under the bridge over there. Too bad you don't have an umbrella, 'cause it's really coming down now. It's not supposed to let up until the end of the week. You, uh, want me to get you closer to your door? Well, let's see here. That... [gun cocks] [announcer on TV] They run the option... -[gun fires] -[car horn blares] The ball is tipped... Fumble! Fumble! [man 1] He dropped the ball! We're going to lose! [man 2] Do it, you guys! Oh, man! Oh, what a day he's been having! Hey, someone call the cops! What's going on? [chatter over police radio] The eyewitnesses, the kids, now really don't know what they saw. What was her last pick-up location? The taxi stand on George, in the Tenderloin. Didn't even take a penny. Her fares are all accounted for. My kids play up there. He must have been up there behind that chain-link fence. Watching us go through the paces. Having to deal with the fucking mess he left behind. He must've really been enjoying himself. It must really be hard on you to have to walk onto a murder site and get down in the blood and juices, and try to slip under the skin of a dead body and make it live again so that you can feel how desperately they had to fight for life. You don't have it in you, the strength to have intimacy without emotion. You can't be cool or detached. And so, with each one of them a little bit of you dies, too. Oh, yeah. It must be hard. "This is the Scorekeeper speaking. I'm the murderer of the taxi driver last Tuesday night. I suggest you run this letter, or I'll have to do my thing to prove it. Here's an earring." It's a match for the taxi driver. "You could have caught me if you searched the park properly instead of holding road races with your motorcycles, seeing who could make the most noise. Two of your officers even talked to me. Stupid. A bomb along a road. What a surprise that would be. Everything you need to have a blast available right at the hardware store. Me: seven. You: zero." Wait a minute, are you telling me the son of a bitch stood there and talked to our guys? Did they get a description? No. He was standing across the street in the fog. They didn't know who they were talking to. They were lucky. They'd probably be dead. Shit, I don't believe this. We had the bastard. You know, if the press gets wind of this, we'll never hear the end of it. For now, we deny that any of our men ever talked to him. It didn't happen. There won't be a bomb. How the hell do you know? [Lucca] Because it's not his style. He's just fucking with us. A scare tactic. It's a game. We don't want to throw everybody into a panic. Quit telling us what he's going or not going to do. You're no closer to this than any of us. -[Payne] All right, all right. -Go fuck yourself. He's lost all objectivity on this case. He's starting to sound like a frigging shrink. All right. No, Jon, Jon! Jon, Jon! Watch out! Watch out! [Brownlee] Come on, guys! This isn't going to do anything! Knock it off! No! Let me go! [Brownlee] Come on! [crashing] [Lucca] Let me go! Let me go! Fuck! [Lloyd] It must really be hard. Holding onto your dignity, your values as a human being, as you slip into the sick fuck who did it. Pulled the trigger 10 times, or slashed and tore with a cold blade. Spilled the blood, and still walking around. That's the hard part. You know, it's against the law to drive with an open container. [engine starts] [Lucca] Eight minutes into eight days into eight years. You look at your watch, you look at your calendar, but none of that applied to me anymore. It was all becoming a blur. [Suzy] Mom! Jennifer's copying me. Mom won't let us ride the bus. Yeah. That's the only reason I go to school. Morning. Go on in there and finish your breakfast. But I am. It's really gross. Mom needs cooking lessons. What's going on? [Ann] Girls, I want you to go upstairs and get your homework. Now, okay? Go. What the fuck's going on? Who put it in the paper? Why didn't I see it? You're driving them to school. I don't want to talk about it anymore. I'll be there in an hour. [Ann] Jenny, are you skating today? -[Jennifer] Yeah. -[Ann] Get your skates. [Jennifer] I'm brushing my hair! Okay, I got your skates. Come on, quick! Look it, he's not going to be killing kids getting off a school bus. You and everybody else are doing exactly what he wants. Oh, yeah? That's right. He's rattling everybody's cage. He's getting off on the attention. And you are willing to risk your own kids' lives that you're right. Jon, this psycho has been getting away with killing people and writing you about it for years. Maybe he's talking about Jennifer and Suzy specifically. I can't take that chance. "I shall no longer announce when I commit my murders. They shall look like routine incidents." Maybe then you can forget this whole damn thing. "Only you, Jon, will know when I do my thing." He's dumping the whole thing back on me. You know, you are scaring me, Jon. You're scaring me to death. Hey. Take it easy, okay? You don't even see what you're doing to this family, do you? Girls, come on! Right away! Are you going to be late again? No. I'm going to try to get home early. -Great. -Good. You guys have a good day, all right? -Okay. Bye. -Bye, Dad. Bye! -Hey, Jon. -Hey, Harry. How are you? When are you going to do something about this nut? He's making us all a little jumpy. Harry, is that gun loaded? Of course it's loaded. What good's an unloaded gun? Give it to me. Everybody's packing something. I know. Just give it to me. Shit, man, you know I'm basically a nonviolent person, but when people start shooting at my kids, I'm shooting back. I don't blame you. Now give it to me. I'll return it to your house. I'll come by and visit. I'll be by, all right? Shit. Hi, Kathy. How you doing? You want the usual? Yes, please. Can I have a cup of coffee, please? To go. Cream and sugar. Stop hounding me. Thank you. I don't have to answer your questions anymore, and you know it. And I'm sick and tired of losing jobs and having people afraid of me because of the questions you ask them about me. I'm sorry about that, Lloyd. I just want you to remember one thing. No matter where you go, no matter what you do, I'm going to be there. Watching you. Everybody's afraid up here, because of the murders and all. Every time I turn around, there's you! It isn't fair. Why are you doing this to me? Why are you trying to ruin my life? Will you stop hounding me, God damn it? Stop hounding me! Do your job! Catch this son of a bitch! I will. [chatter over police radio] Well, he says you've already cost him two jobs. His friends and family won't talk to him. He has no friends, and his family's scared to death of him. He says he can't go back to school. He's claiming for physical and psychological damages. According to this, he's even getting death threats -from some of the victims' families. -[coughing] Good. Jon, come on. Put yourself in his shoes for a second. I have! He's the guy! And you know it! [Fredricks] Jon, look, I know the pressure you're under, and I know your hunch is usually right, but I'm telling you, you know we can't go into court on a hunch. It's not admissible evidence. [Payne] Christ, Jon, look at yourself. You look like a mess. You want it to be him so bad you're giving yourself ulcers. You got to get Lloyd Carl Warden out of your head. He's been through every frigging agency in the show. Fuck you. He's a freak, there's no doubt about that, but he's clean. Look, you've been killing yourself on this one for eight years. -We all appreciate it. -Don't do it to me. Don't do it to me. -I got to take you off for your own good. -Don't do it to me. Don't do it to me! Brownlee's going to work with Fredricks on this mess. You're going to go on to other cases. [siren wailing] [dispatcher over radio] Possible hostage situation. Perp is one male, white, six feet tall, weighs approximately 250 pounds. [Brownlee] Okay, just calm down. [man] He just pulled out a gun and started waving it around! He said he was the Scorekeeper. I think we finally got the son of a bitch, Jon. Lloyd Carl Warden? -Don't know. -[chattering] It's an old-style peepshow room. We got it surrounded. He's got no way out of there. -Is he in here? -Yeah, in the middle of that one. Careful, he might go off. What the hell are you doing here? Just here to share in the glory you don't deserve? -[man] Anybody comes in here, she's dead! -[woman] No! -Jon! -My God! [woman crying] Who the fuck are you? -[Brownlee] Damn! -[woman] Please help me! -[Lucca] Who the fuck are you? -You know who the fuck I am. [Lucca] No, I don't know who you are. Who are you? I'm the fuckin' Scorekeeper, man! -The hell you are, buddy! -If you don't get me out of here safe and put that gun down now, I'm going to blow this bitch away. Move it! All right. Here you go. Get the gun away from her head. -No way! -Help me. All right, get the gun away from her head. Put it down now! All right. You're some lonely piece of shit looking for attention. -Who the fuck is this guy? -Come on... Get him out of here now, or I'll blow her away, I mean it! You know what? I don't think you ever killed anybody. I don't think you ever killed anybody in your life. You wouldn't know a thing! -You've never killed anybody in your life. -I'll kill this bitch now! You ain't gonna start now. You ain't got the balls for it. -Get that gun away! -I'm going to do it! Get that fucking gun... [woman screaming] [all clamoring] Upon searching the deceased suspect's apartment, we found a cache of weapons, including a .357 Magnum which we believe might've been the weapon used in the Scorekeeper murders. Ballistic tests are currently underway. Also recovered were maps and newspaper clippings related to the Scorekeeper murders. As of this time, we are confident that we've put an end to his reign of terror. Lieutenant Lucca is in good condition. We are all very thankful to him for his bravery. [all clamoring] "Having a not-so-wonderful time. Wish you were here, Ron and George and Michael." Look. Okay. Things are coming along nicely. The muscle tissue that the bullet hit is healing nicely, as is the wound. You should be out of here in no time. However, we have found something that concerns me greatly. You are developing some nasty-looking ulcers, Detective Lucca. What it boils down to is that you are going to have to drastically change your lifestyle. You got to quit drinking, quit smoking. You should probably quit your job. At the very least, you should take a vacation. Girls, be careful you don't slip. The deck is wet. Careful. Come on, guys, help. -I caught you back. -Did not! Please... You guys just help us, please? Oh, gross! -I bet he's got a hard-on. -Hey. -You're it. -No, you're it. Help me, come on, come on. Hey! Hey! Hey! Jon. Jon? You're scaring the girls. Please. You know, it was another woman. You know, something I could read about in Cosmo... Lament to my girlfriends about. If I could, if I didn't have the girls... I'd blow his brains out. I swear to God I would. Just to put an end to all of this, just to... Get you back. [thunder rumbling] [Brownlee] They want to give all of us citations. What for? We know the guy you shot wasn't him. As far as I'm concerned, it was him. [refilling glass] It's over, and I'm glad it is. I've decided to leave Homicide. I've seen what this case has done to you, and I'm not going to let it happen to me. If I was you, I'd start thinking about doing the same thing. You and I have seen enough dead bodies to last a lifetime. What are you going to do? Vice might be fun. Then again, pawnshop detail would be okay, too. [both chuckling] [clinking] [Ann grunting] Jon? Uh... Ow! Almost... Honey? [coughs] I'll be all right. Just give me a second. [Lucca] When I was a cop, I was confronted all the time by people who absolutely knew the killer of someone they loved. But they couldn't prove it. The killer was going to get away. They wanted to run over the bastard and walk out of the dark and blow him away. But I always talked them out of it. And that night, there I was, so close to blowing your brains out. And getting away with it. How'd it feel to be so close to losing control like that? To be that close to destroying everything you believe in, huh? -How did that make you feel? -Hmm... I felt sick. But only because I couldn't do it. [gasps] What are you doing? Dad! Oh... What are you doing here? Are you out of your mind? You're the one who's out of his mind! What are you doing, following me? Hey, Mr. Lucca, it was my fault. Both of you, what, are you crazy? Don't you understand something? You see this? This could've been on the other side of the flashlight. Do you understand me? This could've been the last thing you guys saw. Do you get it? Now get my daughter home. Get out of here! Jennifer, wake up. Jennifer, get up and go to your bed. Go to bed, honey. If I catch you in that situation again, you'll be very sorry. Jon, is there a place where this is ever going to stop? I don't want this in my house anymore. You have chosen to let this thing destroy everything we had. Every time you walk in the door, that monster comes in with you. You're sick, Jon, and I don't know how to help you. I don't want this anymore. I'll move out. [laughing] Oh, yeah. What's so funny, Marshal? Ah, ain't this a pretty picture. That is the motherfucker that beat me so bad I lost my right nut. His wife got him. Ain't that fucking beautiful? I'm going to take this home and put it on my mantel. [people chattering] Who the fuck are you? FBI. [Payne] Wait, wait, Lucca! They are the FBI. They're moving all the files to their office in Sacramento. Not my files. Hey, look, we're on the same side here, all right? Hey, come on, come on, let him go. Get off of him! [Lucca] That's my life! That's my life! Cool, Lucca. Come on. Let him up. Fuck you. Don't do this, Jon. [Lucca] So finally everything had been cut out of my life. Everything but him. -[coughing] -He knew he had me. He knew I'd be out there, his captive audience. I'd walk out onto scene after scene of his sickness. No one would know that he'd done it. He involved me somehow, made me feel like I was his... Conscience? Keep everyone out. [Lucca] The list grew, but only I knew it. All I could do was wait and watch, and try to be there when he fucked up. Just the two of us now. What the fuck are you doing here? [Fredricks] "This is the Scorekeeper speaking, comma, I am back with you, period. That city dick Lucca, dot, dot, dot... That ex-city dick Lucca was good, comma, but I am smarter and better, period. I am waiting for a good movie about me, period. Who will play me? Period. I am now in control of all things, period. Yours truly... Me: Guess. You: zero." I've reluctantly held this press conference because this letter had somehow been leaked to the press. It has been examined by the LAPD, the FBI, as well as our own handwriting experts. All have agreed the letter is a forgery. [all groan] [reporter] You saying the letter is a fake? We don't want or need to create anymore unneeded hysteria. This case was solved and closed years ago. This press conference is over. [all clamoring] [reporter] If the Scorekeeper didn't write it, then who did? The letter was manufactured by... By someone who knows a great deal about the background and M.O. of the Scorekeeper. Some lunatic who gets a kick out of terrorizing the public. [reporter] How do you know he's a lunatic? You know that letter doesn't mean shit one way or the other. The guy's still out there killing people, and you know it. [all chattering] You wrote that letter, didn't you? Lloyd Carl Warden must be loving this. My wife asks about you every now and then, how you're doing and all. I say you're doing fine, looking good. Then I realize I'm just lying to myself. Listen, I quit figuring things out a long time ago. You know what Ann said once? She said she'd blow the fucker's brains out and get it over with. I wish I could do it. But you know me. I got to catch the fucker. I got to do it by the book. I got to be sure. Then I'll blow his fucking brains out. Hmm... This is the only place where someone saw him and lived to talk about it. What do you mean, "Lived to talk about it"? One of the kids lived long enough to give a description of him. I never read about that. It was never made public. -[laughing] -[girl screams in distance] You hear that? What, them carp talking to you again? Shut up. Listen. Nah, that's an owl. That ain't no fucking owl. [man] It took an hour and a half for the ambulance to get here. She was suffering so much, she just kept begging me to put her out of her misery. She wasn't bleeding anymore... But there were so many stab wounds, I guess she just must have... She must've run out of blood. I found the boy on the road. I guess he must've crawled from the campsite. I never saw so much blood in all my life. I kind of figured you'd show up. You want to take a look at the girl? Maybe he thought by wearing the hood, he could spend more time with his victims. You know, create some sort of a relationship. [Lucca] Relationship? [laughs] You sick fuck. I'm only speculating. If you don't want my opinion, what are we doing here? All right. He puts on a hood, walks into the woods, finds the kids camping. Then what? He ties them up? No, not yet. It's too soon. More than likely, he'd start a conversation. About what? Who knows? Small talk probably. It must have been very exciting for him. Why would he waste the time bullshitting? He could just kill the kids. [chuckles] Sick. Because this time... You know, with the hood, the secluded area, He could take his time, stretch it all out. Enjoy it. The possession. He could stand right next to them and feel their breaths become a part of him. [girl] That's Andromeda, the chained lady. [boy] Oh, yeah? Looks like a bunch of stars to me. Well, squint and use your imagination. Okay, I'm squinting. Nope. No lady. No chains. Just a bunch of stars. You're hopeless. Why'd you take astronomy, anyway? I don't know. Thought it'd be easy. Well, plus I needed the credits. Yeah. [cocks gun] [man] You know how to swim? Um... Yeah, sure. Have you ever swum in here before? No. This is a man-made lake. It's only 15 feet deep in the middle. Oh. I didn't know that. They flooded it 20 years ago. It was nothing more than a cow pasture. It used to be stocked with trout and bass. And now there's nothing in it but bullhead and carp. Bottom feeders. Good for nothing, really. Tie the girl up. What? No. Now! Hands behind her back. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. Just do as he says, okay? Just roll over, okay? [breathing rapidly] I'm just going to tie you up, and then he'll leave us alone. He doesn't want to hurt us. Right? Okay? It's okay. He's not going to hurt us. Get on your stomach. It's okay. [babbling] [sobbing] Please. [girl sobbing] [knife unsheathes] [screams] Ah... I'm going to have to kill you. Look, I could give you some money or something, man! You're both going to die. [screaming] You did it, didn't you? Jon... I didn't. [Lloyd] Hey! Watch where the fuck you're going! Watch it, watch it! What the fuck you doing, man? Jesus. Fuck! That's it. You're too fucked up to drive. [groans] That's it. Tour is over. That's it, Jon! We took your little fucking ride down memory lane! I didn't ejaculate in my pants! I didn't start screaming, "I did it! I did it," which is what you want me to do, huh? Well, I can't help you! It's over! We both know you're the real last victim. [coughing] The last victim of your own obsession. So fucking jump! Better yet... [car horn honks] ...crawl back to your shitty little room and die, not knowing the truth, leaving me alone, leaving the world at risk, your world, unguarded, because he's still out there! And worst of all, you won't be here to know what happens to friend or foe. Die! Die! [coughing] Feel better? Jon... What the fuck did I ever do to you? I'm sorry. What? You're sorry? You're fucking sorry, you piece of shit? You're fucking sor... [laughing] Sorry! Jon... I believe I can help you after all. [humming theme to Big Valley] [imitates gun firing] [continues humming theme to Big Valley] [chuckles] Amazing. After all you've done, I can still look upon you with mercy. [muffled yelling] I will give you what you want. You know why I am the way I am? Because I'm free! [laughs] Man created civilization to protect himself from himself. [pounding] But civilization has one major drawback. Frustration. So to deal with this frustration, society has set up a system of laws and moral prohibitions. And it was your job to enforce these laws. Of course, that's impossible. The way I see it, society gets the kind of criminals it deserves. The more it clamps down, the more those of us that are truly free must rise up against it. [humming] [car horn honks] [honking] Your wheel! Your wheel! -Your wheel! -[honking] Yeah! Yeah! Pull over! Pull over! [car door opens and closes] Sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you, but I noticed that your left rear wheel seemed to be wobbling. It's not too bad, but I think you should get it checked as soon as possible. [Lucca making muffled yells] Yeah, I'd get that looked at. I will, thanks. There's a service station about 10 miles up the road. It's open 24 hours and it's just off the freeway. Look... Uh... Look... If it'll make you feel any better, I've got a lug wrench in my trunk. I could tighten it up for you a little. You know, just to get you to the station. Well, if it wouldn't be too much trouble. Not at all. [humming theme to Big Valley] [groaning] Here we go! Oh, you don't have to get out. Uh, I can take care of it. [straining] [resumes humming] You live around here? Over in San Ramon. How about you? Napa. Napa? Hey. It's nice out that way. I'm headed up to my Mom's place in Chico. I like driving at night. Less traffic. There. That ought to do it. Well, thank you. I appreciate it. Oh, not at all. You get that looked at, huh? [humming] [starts engine] [Lloyd starts car] [Lloyd] Are you okay? [woman] I think so. You sure you're not hurt? I'm just... I'm just a little shook up. Must've been worse than it looked. I thought you could make it to the gas station for sure. I'm just glad that you're nice enough to help out. Do you mind? Oh, heck no. I used to smoke for 25 years, but I had to stop. [inhales deeply] Ahh. I still love the smell of them. Nothing's ever happened to me like that before. All of a sudden, the wheel started shaking. There was nothing I could do but hold on for the ride. That's all you can do. What do you do in, uh, Napa? I work in a bank. The Wells Fargo. How about you? I'm in the extermination business. Have been for about 20 years, I guess. [groaning] Do you always go around helping people on the road like this? Yes. I try to help as often as I can. [pounding] [laughing] [muffled yell] See how easy it is, Jon? Do you see how they're just out there waiting to be taken? Oh, she knows she's going to die. [muffled yelling] And it's exhilarating. That moment of recognition. That moment when she realizes that she is mine. That her last breath will be mine. [Lloyd] Shit! [woman] No! [muffled yelling] Make all the noise you want! [muffled yelling] [Lloyd breathing heavily] [Lloyd chuckles] [gun firing repeatedly] [firing continues] [muffled yell] Happy birthday. [turn signal clicking] [metallic scraping] [muffled coughing] These gloves just don't seem to fit. [muffled coughing] What's wrong, Jon? Don't you recognize your old precinct? Isn't this where you wanted our tour to end? Huh? [metal detector buzzer sounds] Excuse me, you... Hey, whoa. Jesus! Get down! Get down! [people screaming] [police officer] Come on, bro. Come on, put the gun down. Now! Come on. You don't want to die, right? [coughing] Don't make me do it. -Are you going to shoot me? -Get down! Or should I confess? Is that what you want me to do? Huh? -It's your move. -Put it down! It's your gun. Your gloves. Your car. Your corpus delicti. You're going down, Jon. But at least as you lay dying in your cell, you'll know that you were right. At least you'll have that. It was me all these years. And it'll keep being me long after you're gone. Put the gun down, or I'll drop you! I'll miss you, Jon. Put the gun down on the ground now! But I promise to think of you each and every time. There. Feel better? Last chance! I will drop you! Now! [woman screams] [siren wailing] I feel like shit. [groans] [coughs]
