Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Han Miao, talk to me. Let me help. I was in Su Jie's office. Watching his interview with the reporter, Fang Xiao Qin. MISSING YOU After the interview she stayed awhile to see Su Jie's famous sculpture. TRUTH Suddenly… All my horrible childhood memories of the war… Flooded back with the attack. I can't hear. Still can't hear. Can you hear now? Barely. It won't reboot. But we can read lips. Like old times. We were trapped 6 hours in his safe room. We soon learned there were many bombs in the building. But for those 6 hours... didn't you feel safe? I felt... scared… Horrible. Outside was hell. Explosions, screaming... We thought we may die at any moment. My claustrophobia became unbearable. And Su Jie… Didn't he help you? I just needed you. Only you. Zi Xuan makes me laugh. So much that it hurts my face. They all said… I fell in love with him too fast too deep. But I don't care. Your telescope has been found. Sending address now. I was here first. It's mine. Yi, you're the boss, tell her. - Sir, I'm begging you. - Sorry, Han Miao. I didn't know Zhu had an alert for this telescope. Damn right. Only a few of these survived the war. Sir, will you actually use this or put it in a museum? I'll have an auction next month. You can buy it there. I'll pay you double! So it was just sitting there in the store? Mm. You know how many years I've been looking for this? Triple! - Lucky find. - Really lucky! I know it's an outdoor war museum, but… Seems a waste never to rebuild here. So horrible. Han Miao, look. I don't want to look. We're almost there. Shuttle launch area? You're unbelievable. How often do they launch? Twice a day. And… I booked us a tour of the launch site on our last day. I'm sure you did. We could hike to the launch site if it's a nice day. Welcome. I'm Yuki. I hope you have a lovely weekend in our heritage home! What kind of voice is that? Quick, open the door. I really love it. Babe, I'll start on dinner. You take a rest. Zi Xuan. Hey, Da Tong. Got privacy? Yeah, I got my earpiece. She told you yet? She keeps avoiding the subject. So what's your plan now? Hi cuties. Who trapped you in here? They were trapped together in the safe room for six hours. I just don't trust him. I don't trust Su Jie either, but I'm also not so innocent. Huh? What? Nothing. Another thing, I saw something in her bag. A small box. I think it's an Exclusive Ring. So what are you thinking? Dunno. But I can't risk losing her. I gotta go. Zi Xuan, Is there a pond around here? I found three fish. What are you doing? He actually did it. Is it really the NIS? It really is. We are at the doorstep of destiny. Your life is about to change in an amazing way. This is the NIS Pill. The first nano-quantum computer with 9th Gen A.I. Billions of NIS nano-bots will form a computer inside of you, generating neural pathways that will soon host millions of NIS Apps. But to acclimate your body and mind, the NIS will have only one app in its first few weeks of release: Guidance. We long to be loved and to be understood. Guidance can help you to truly connect with people. And at Level One, warn you if someone is lying by studying body language, speech patterns and micro expressions. But does Guidance read your mind or tell people your secrets? Absolutely not. It just gives you information and suggestions. Guidance is powered by a simple yet powerful engine... Truth. Truth to repair the trust destroyed by the Great War. So, Su Jie gave you these boxes a few weeks ago? Uh. - After the terror attack? - Yeah. - What did you think was in the boxes? - I don't know. Zi Xuan, we have the NIS 3 days before everyone else. What are we waiting for? Hi, Mai Zi Xuan. - You hear a voice in your head? - I do. Would you like to keep my audio function? Sure. Based on your online history I think you prefer a female voice. Or you can choose from other voices. No need. This is great. I'll also get to know you by observing you. I'll finish installing outside, ok? Okay. Hey, I know I can't stop people from analyzing me. But if I didn't install Guidance, then Han Miao would be suspicious. It depends how much you trust each other. But… You'll help me keep some things private, right? You'll help me keep some things private. Mmm. I cannot. Cannot? I can't help you deceive people. Hang on, I didn't say deceive people. Anyway, you can't deceive someone who has the Guidance App. Stop saying the word 'deceive'. I'm talking about little white lies. Turn around. Even white lies hinder personal and societal progress. What if I don't want to hurt someone's feelings. I can help you be kind and truthful. But becoming a better person comes at a price. A price? Mr. Su, about your father… And allegations his tech was used in the Great War. My father died 9 years ago. I understand, but the NIS is built on your father's work and you're releasing it in three months. So if your father were here today, what would you say to him? I would thank him. Do you consider the NIS a danger to what it means to be human? Not at all. Our technology promotes human connection and self-awareness, and above all, empathy. How is that dangerous? In fact, I chose Guidance because it was my father's last project. But isn't this an unnatural unity of AI, hardware and Human? We've had a fragile peace since the Great War 10 years ago. To use tools we invent to make us happy is very natural. Really, Ling? Yeah, I get it. That's awesome. Yeah, that's fine. Okay, let's chat later. See you. Wild to have a voice inside your head, isn't it? Did you choose a woman's voice for the Guidance App? - The system chose it for me. - The system? - Ling chose it. - Ling? What? It's not like the old movie where the guy falls in love with his Computer. What are you talking about? If Ling senses I'm in love with her, she'll shut down immediately. I was just curious. I don't see the issue... The delivery drone is here. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SAFE ROOM? My claustrophobia returned. DID ANYTHING HAPPEN WITH SU JIE? Of course not, what do you mean? WHEN DID HE GIVE YOU THE NIS PILLS? It's all here. Go home. Clear skies tonight. We can use the telescope. So the App lectured me earlier, about Anthropology and white lies. Kinda weird. It's not weird. The Great War began ten years ago because of lies. But those weren't white lies. - Same thing. - How's it the same thing? A white lie to me could be a big lie to you. Not necessarily. Who cares if I lie to someone that they look good. Society is based on trust, trust is built on truth. You remove truth, you destroy trust. That's a bit extreme. Perhaps someone asks you if they look nice, because they want to impress someone they like. But it's weird we can't choose. It's not weird! You okay? Are the nightmares back? Why don't you ever wake me? Why should we both lose sleep? You sure you okay? Of course. Hold on. You remember the night we met? At Ping Ping's costume party. You were hiding in the corner. And when we danced… You were so stiff. But not for long. - How'd you know I can dance? - I didn't. I said to myself that night... this girl is special. You know... I'll do anything for you. What's going on here? But the top corner isn't burnt. Why hide a copy of a famous painting in a secret room? The painting you're thinking of is in a museum. But a farmer found this painting in an abandoned home two weeks ago. The artist was separated from his lover during the Great War. He'd paint her favorite flower and send it to her regularly. He sent 20 paintings in six years. Painting number 20 is in the Museum. This is number 19. The rest were either destroyed or lost. A few weeks after she died, the drone carrying this painting crashed near her house. All he wanted was to send her something beautiful. And the world wouldn't let him. You asked me once how to win back a lost love. Garden flowers... wrapped in regular paper. Flowers? And then would you have come back to me? It's just basketball. Why play so rough? Next time I see Zhang Da Tong, I'll punch him for hurting you. How do you know I didn't start it? Can you even bear to hurt a fly? Mm. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Baby... Mm? Your hands smell of garlic. Fine. Time for dinner anyway. Ling? Yes. What about secrets? Secrets are easier to hide. But I know what you are trying to hide. I've seen your private messages. You know? Yes. Will you tell Han Miao? No. The system doesn't work like that. But if she asks then I can't help you hide secrets. That's fine. She won't find out. And… Will she find out if we go to higher levels of Guidance? Not unless she thinks of the right question. But higher levels give her access to your physiological data, which makes it impossible to lie. Good. But aren't you abusing her trust if you don't confess? What? Abusing? Yes. And if she finds out? She'll forgive me. So just tell her now. She'll probably leave when you tell her. So just tell her now so she can find someone new. What? Leave me? Someone new? What are you saying? Sorry, Zi Xuan. I'm saying it's not fair to them. They're perfectly happy. How would you know? You can't just throw them in a pond. Why not? They're not your fish. They don't belong here either. Oh? Did you ask them? Hey, goldfish! You wanna live in a pond? Maybe our NIS can ask them. Even Su Jie's amazing NIS can't speak Fish language. Nice performance. Anyway, goldfish don't have memories. Not true. They remember things up to three months and can recognize faces. Including your silly face. Really? And they also see UV and infrared. Another power cut. Get more candles. Oh yeah, Guidance asked me today about higher levels. Hm? Highest level is like when… My App tells your Ling things about my behavior like heart rate, brain waves... - hormones and other bio data… - Hang on. Were you that upset over the Ling thing? Deliberately making pasta to punish me? You know I hate spaghetti. I didn't. Mm hmm. Unbelievable. It's south. And the constellation symbol? Symbol... Months wasted teaching you. 28 Mansions and four symbols! Man Zi Xuan, it's a lot to remember! Passengers on night flights get the best views. Then we'll go on a night flight. Only two years until our turn. Or sooner if Su Jie gets us on his private shuttle. Two years will fly by. Hey... Do you think... Su Jie's NIS will really change the world? Yeah. You think he feels guilty that his Dad's A.I. was used in the Great War? Maybe. So he's desperate to make Guidance successful. You know Guidance would be impossible not to use, right? Not really. You can uninstall it anytime. So two billion people will have it and if I don't have it. Then my friends, family, boss, or you will all think I'm hiding something. Yeah, but it's all about the 23% theory. Even if you get 23% of the planet to change their behavior it doesn't guarantee global change. It's just a theory. But it's a theory we can finally test. So stop being so cynical. What voice you have in your head? My own voice. I named her after my mom. Why did you call yours Ling? Just popped into my head. Ling... Rings a bell. Ling... Zhang Ling? Your ex-girlfriend? Pretty, hot, young Ling? I didn't even think about that. You don't think it's weird. You chose your Ex's name for the voice in your head? I just thought it's a good name. What's the matter now? First your system chose a girl's voice, then you choose your Ex's name for it. So what? Are you really over her? Of course! And she's not that young. Only four years younger than me. Four years younger than you, seven years younger than me! I don't have feelings for her! Ask Tian Tian! I mean, maybe I thought about her for a bit after we got together. What?! I thought we… Weren't we supposed to be honest with each other?! Fine. What kind of voice does she have? Soft? Sexy? Old? Normal, maybe, more or less. Is it like the voice at the front door? More or less. Ling... Do you think I chose your name, 'Zhang Ling' because of my Ex's name? Zi Xuan, I really don't know. Why isn't that a fair question? We're here to discuss the NIS, not if the war changed me. But it's all connected. The war changed us all. Who you are, what you believe, how you see the world, impacts your technology and apps. For the first time in our history we saw the use of new bio-weapons. Weapons that not only immediately kill victims at ground zero, but also have cruel time delayed effects. They can cause radiation poisoning 10 to 15 years after to people far from ground zero. You tell me. What kind of animal makes a weapon like this? You ask me... how the war changed me. Resolve. Resolve to do anything to avoid another war. Does this resolve include using war technology? I've asked whether your father's tech was used in the Great War. In fact, his prototype of Guidance was used by the enemy to gain information from our people… Wasn't it? I've been thinking... Let's start fresh. Yeah. I totally agree. So let's activate the highest level of Guidance. We hide nothing. And forgive each other for anything we may discover Hang on. What? I totally forgive you for the Ling thing. Tian Tian, give Mai Zi Xuan highest access to my behavior data. - What are you afraid of? - Nothing, nothing. You serious about the forgiveness and stuff? Ling... Give... What's wrong? Ling... Give Han Miao the highest level access to my bio data. Let's go hiking? Sure. Just one more thing. Changing voice now. Is this voice okay, Mai Zi Xuan? Mm. Is it changed? Mm. Let's call him Jack, yeah? I wanna fight. You don't. I do. - You won't win. - I will win. - You really think you'll win? - Let's do it. You ready? I'd win if I had fake eyelashes too. - I don't have fake eyelashes! - Of course you do. I don't have fake eyelashes! Oh! Sorry, sorry. It's okay. So... Did you also lose the basketball game? What? Come here you! Don't be a sore loser! You needn't worry. You created Guidance... NIS... all of it, so people can evolve. You've sacrificed everything for this. Yes. I have sacrificed everything. You made this room just like your parents' shelter. The thing is, my happiest memories were in that room. A museum of our memories. Not a museum to me. It's where I fell in love with you. I wanted to ask you. When Su Jie gave you the NIS's, was that the first time you saw him after the terror attack? Yeah. - You guys talk about anything? - No. So he gives you the NIS boxes. And then you leave. Mm. What's wrong? Jack's not saying anything. That's because it's true, silly. Doesn't fit. Why doesn't it fit? You're both trapped in the safe room for 6 hours and the first time you see him after that you just get the NIS and leave. What's really going on? Su Jie wanted me to test the NIS. Why didn't you tell me before? I wanted to think about it. Why does he want you to test the NIS? Clearly he trusts me. Zi Xuan, you just caught Han Miao in a lie I couldn't detect when she said she didn't talk to Su Jie about anything. Don't forget you're both at the highest level for Guidance. What are you talking about? What am I talking about? Small lies always point to bigger lies! So you're Confucius now. What are you hiding? You're just jealous. - I'm not! - Then what? Insecure. - Is there a difference? - Of course there's a difference. If it's another guy, I wouldn't care. But it's Su Jie. God! You're such an idiot! He's a like a parasite and now he's in my head! What are you babbling about? I see it when your eyes go dark! When you disappear! And you never reach out to me because of him! Right?! Then why am I with you?! - I'd also like to know. - Because I want you! You make me happy... like no one else has. Happy in ways I couldn't dream. I can see a future for us. A future where I can forget my past. Because you make me feel safe. I know what I want. I want you. But you don't know... do you? Do you want to be with me? I do. I really do! Were you relieved you didn't find an Exclusive Ring in my bag? No. I just didn't know if you still loved him. Okay. How about I interrogate you now? - Friends say you flirt with other girls. - What? No. It's all innocent stuff. Small lies lead to bigger lies. It was only a few times. And Ling? You ever think about her? It's not like that. Then what it's like? You ever think about Wang Si Qi? Yeah. You ever do anything with them? - Who? - Those girls. No. How about you condemn me if I actually cross a line. - Like with Ping Ping? - Ping Ping? You had a physio session with her last year and left your hand on her thigh for a long time. - You have to be kidding. - So you did do it? Mm... No. No. It says I lied but I actually don't remember. Did you want something to happen? I never thought about it! What's there to think about. Han Miao... This isn't us. I know I've hurt you. I get that you didn't cheat... but what you do... is more dangerous. You listen with your heart... And then... they think you can save them. That's how I fell in love with you. I'm afraid one day... You'll realize... I can't save you. You've already saved me. You've already saved me. Han Miao, talk to me. Let me help you. I was in Su Jie's office... watching his interview with the reporter, Fang Xiao Qin. Remember what you told my dad? You told him I wrote a love letter to another girl And lied to me about it! We were only 9 years old! So you say to my dad, 'make an app that stops Su Jie from being a jerk' And also tells me when he's lying. Dad said it was the best idea he ever heard. It was just my imagination. Imagination makes the impossible, possible. Someday, I'll repay you for your help with Guidance. What's that? ONLY A FEW BOMBS EXPLODED, REST WERE FAKE. Just an empty attack. But they need time to verify. I wanted to give you something. Look how your imagination made the impossible, possible. It's finished? In 3 months we'll have billions of units. Enough for 23% of the planet. Precisely. Just as you planned. This could change human behavior within months. Few hours. I'm so proud of you. Han Miao... Did you freeze when you heard the bombs? I thought... I'd forgotten those horrible memories. When I heard the bombs today... I just froze. I don't... If you weren't with me... I don't know what I'd do... SPECIAL ANTI-NIGHTMARE WATER CONTAINS MAGICAL POWERS Yuki. What's the news today? The big news today is the NIS rollout. It's been a staggering global roll out. In 24 hours two billion NIS devices have been installed across the planet. We spoke to the Lotus CEO on this historic day. 3 months ago your NIS program was almost derailed in a brazen attack. Were you in any danger at any point? Not at all. We knew the NIS could attract anti-tech militants so we have safe rooms on each floor. They're solid, safe, and even sound proof. Can't hear a thing from outside. I've been calling you. What's wrong? High value delivery arriving. "Han Miao please accept this flower, in a plain box". "And allergy free." "Su Jie". Why's he giving you a priceless gift? To thank me for helping with Guidance. What did you really do for this gift? What?! I dare you to repeat that! What's Jack telling you? Does it matter? You've already fooled Jack once! How does he even know we're here? I have no idea. What's this help you gave him on Guidance? None of your business. Okay. So how about this. You said it was hell being stuck in the safe room. Your claustrophobia and so on. And you said... You said outside was hell, explosions, screaming. What? I just heard an interview with Su Jie. He said the safe rooms are sound proof! I have no idea what you're saying. And now you get expensive paintings! How could you hear bombs? I never said I heard. I told you how I felt. You asked me to open up to you and you do this to me? You should be happy he gave me this painting. What's Jack telling you? I'm sorry. You're right. Zi Xuan? You still love him? Are you in love with his memory? You mean everything to me. You've known him 20 years. You were a couple for ten years. It kills me to always wonder how I compare to him. I want to be a better man for you, but I can't rid this competition inside me. Come. This is our new start. Eat slowly. If you only knew the ugly things I suspected with you two... Zi Xuan. I don't deserve you. Zi Xuan, don't say that. You sure about this? Do you want this? More than you can imagine. Congratulations. Your commitment has been successfully registered. Let's get ready. It's a few hours walk to get to our shuttle tour. Everyone wanted us to be perfect. But we grew apart. We've been together since we were kids. We fell in love during war and hell. I almost died trying to save your parents. We have been through hell. A hell I want to forget. But I can't. This room. 20 years of memories. I don't understand what happened. Mai Zi Xuan will never understand you the way I do. The horror we went through. We shouldn't have done this. It was a mistake. I'm sorry. You know he also cheats, don't you? They're just like humans. Each generation more aggressive. More brutal. More ruthless. Doors will open in 30 seconds. Please don't tell him what happened. This was my mistake. One mistake leaves you with a lifetime of infamy. No one forgives. No one forgets. My father's mistake in the war... will follow him forever. Su Jie. But they don't know him. Su Jie. We are an unforgiving, ruthless species. Mai Zi Xuan will find out what happened. Your mistake tonight is all you'll ever be to him. Get rid of that damn painting. Yes sir. The plan was well executed. I even believed it was real. But it was too damn much with the sonic bomb. You said to make it look convincing. I linked the attack to anti-techers. Just as we planned. Were you successful with her? Not yet. But I gave her two NIS pills. She'll sabotage herself. Did you alter the pills? No need. They'll both install Guidance to find out the truth. She'll want to know if Mai Zi Xuan is cheating. And Mai Zi Xuan will want to know what happened tonight. But Han Miao will try to hack Guidance, to stop Mai Zi Xuan from finding out. Impossible. Guidance is unhackable. True. But she'll still try. And she'll fail. Mai Zi Xuan will discover the truth... And leave her. The whole world will try to beat Guidance. And they'll all fail. My father wanted Guidance to defeat our lower nature. A nature that feeds on lies and deception. A nature we must destroy from within. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SAFE ROOM? Nothing happened. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SAFE ROOM? I was really scared. My claustrophobia returned. Nothing happened. What are you saying? I was really scared. My claustrophobia returned. I just wanted you. Nothing happened. I was really scared. Of course not! My claustrophobia became unbearable. What are you saying? I was really scared. What do you mean? Nothing! My claustrophobia became unbearable. I was really scared. What do you mean? Nothing! I just wanted you. I was really scared. What are you saying? My claustrophobia became unbearable. Of course not! Nothing happened. Nothing happened. My claustrophobia returned. Nothing happened. What happened in the safe room? What are you saying? Nothing happened. Of course not. I was so scared. My claustrophobia became unbearable. I was really scared. What do you mean? Nothing! I was really scared. What are you saying? My claustrophobia became unbearable. Of course not! What are you saying? I was really scared. My claustrophobia returned. I just wanted you. Nothing happened. Nothing happened What are you saying? I was really scared. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SAFE ROOM? Nothing happened. WHY DID SU JIE ASK YOU TO TEST THE NIS? What are you trying to say? WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SAFE ROOM? My claustrophobia returned. Are you concerned your competitors will soon release their own NIS? Your bruise isn't healing. Mm. I've been thinking we should uninstall Guidance. I asked Guidance earlier… That if a life depended on it… Whether it would help... and allow me to hide a lie. It said... its programming won't allow anyone to lie. Not even to save a life. Even if you change its truth parameters... who does the changing? And change it to what? Screw Guidance. We have something far more powerful. Besides... if you live with a lie... no one knows... or can love... the real you. It's too damn lonely. Jack... Uninstall Guidance. Tian Tian. Uninstall Guidance. Are you seeing your nightmare? Tian Tian. Uninstall everything... NIS Guidance. All of it. Sir, they've both uninstalled the NIS. You almost ruined everything. Why did you send me the painting? Almost ruined? Didn't he find out what happened with us? Nothing happened. How did he not find out? How did you... Guidance is unhackable. I didn't hack Guidance. I hacked myself. Impossible. Imagination makes the impossible, possible I don't understand how you... Su Jie... My nightmares where I was drowning. I finished it. What are you saying? I want to know how you beat Guidance. Su Jie. I'm sorry. Guidance won't work the way you hoped, changing everything. It will. And if not, the next version will. Only if people keep the NIS. What choice will they have? Han Miao, I have to tell you something. Hey, you okay? You said... to live with a lie... is the loneliest feeling. I can't hear you! I really have to tell you something. Ten years ago, I was on a plane that got rerouted because of an emergency. A few hours later, there was a bio-weapon attack. I should have told you when we met. I'm sick. Radiation poisoning. Radiation poisoning. How long? In a year... without medical help... I won't be able to walk. Or talk or breathe by myself. In three years... I... I'll be... I'll be gone. I started treatment. But it only slows the radiation. That's why I have a bruise on my chest. I wanted to hold on to you until, until, until... until I couldn't hide my symptoms. Han Miao... Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
