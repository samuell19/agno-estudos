'Rudra Thandavam' (Rudra's Dance) How old are you? - 37. - Get in. Tell me your identification. Sir, sign here. Give him. Let's go, sir. Go inside, sir. Go... - Sir, wait here, I'll bring him. - Okay. I'm Ramachandran, Senior council. Normally, the department action against a Government official and filing FIR will not be done so soon. That's why, the Judge madam of this case, has... ...appointed me as Amicus curiae and sent me. She has asked me to find the true background... ...of this case and submit her a detail report. I have come here for that. Everyone presume that I have come here as an advocate. But only myself, you and the Judge know that I have come as Amicus curiae. - Just maintain it. - Okay, sir. I have heard about Amicus curiae in one of the cases. Definitely I'll tell you all the details, sir. I was born and brought up in a small village near Dharmapuri. My village name is Kariyamangalam. My father is a martial arts teacher. He lived with discipline and principle. Sir, I'm the first person from my village to become a police inspector. I served for seven years at Salem. I got married with Varahi. - Varahi! - Yes, sir. Thereafter, I served two years at T-nagar police station. One day DC called me to discuss something personal with me. In a private pub, he briefed me about the injustice happened to a girl. Rudhran, you form a team, find the culprits and thrash them. If anyone ask from human rights, I'll manage that they've slipped in the washroom. Okay, sir. This should create huge awareness in the media, Rudhran! Not only that, you must take up the next job only after destroying this mob who makes money on women. This is a problem which happens usually to those girls who go to pub and discothe. We are going to target the mob who lure the girls with drugs, strip them nude, takes video and earn money with it. Janu, you're going to play the victim role. I'm very scared, sir! If anything goes wrong! Talk like a cop working in IS, Janu. This is a good opportunity to prove yourself. We're all with you. Do it bravely, Janu. Okay, sir. Sir, Janu was surrounded by four people. Just be patient until it is confirmed that these people belong to that team. Okay, sir. Janu, now they will serve you a drink. Drink it, don't be scared. - We're all wired, don't worry. - Okay. Sir, Janu got sloshed. What shall we do? Janu! Janu! Can you hear me? There is no response from, Janu. Both of you watch her closely. - Yes, sir. - Okay sir. Sir, those guys are taking Janu out. What shall we do? Can we arrest them? No...no... This is a public place. We shouldn't do anything here. We need to know where are they taking her and who is behind this. Let's see what happens. Sir, that team has left. Hey! Go reverse, man Just wait, I'll be back. Hey, how dare you drive Qualis so rash? Do you know the cost of this car? - Who's car is this? - She seems to be inebriated. - Send her and come. - Do you know who is my father? Do you know? Shall I call him? - Hey, get inside. - Hey, I'll not go inside. How dare you? Get inside. Hey, go reverse. Damn it! Janu's mobile phone is connected to us, isn't it? Yes, sir. Check and find out the location. Sir, it shows straight and then right. It shows left here, sir. - Call Janu. - Yes, sir. Damn it! Call the cyber cell, ask them to locate this Ola cab and pinge me in WhatsApp. Okay, sir. Sir...sir... Sir! No sir... Hey! - Sir! Sir! - Leave me. Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Bring her carefully. Hey, that girl thanked you a lot. This case shouldn't go worthless like .., Rudhran. Arrest those four people under Goondas act. Okay, sir. Don't leave them no matter whoever comes in favour. Let them suffer for six months without getting bail. - Sure, sir. - Come. Those four people who got arrested were college students They mix a drug called "LSD" in drinks for the girls who come to the party. After taking it, the girls lose their consciousness and obey to the extent whatever these guys say. Taking advantage of this, this gang blackmail and extort money from those girls and they've made it a big business. Only when the victim comes forward boldly and inform the cops, this kind of gangs can be destroyed. I heartily congratulate Inspector Rudhran who acted meticulously in this particular incident. Thank you, sir. Now drugs culture is rapidly spreading in Tamil Nadu. Girls should be very cautious with new people. Girls should be careful about others and should not fall in their trap. The Tamilnadu Government has ordered to take strict action to prevent this. Way forward, actions against drug trafficking gangs will be grave. You've to take this message to the people of Tamil Nadu. Thank you. Give me. Rudhran, you've been transferred to N4 Fishing Harbour police station. Sir, I didn't seek for transfer! Hey, it's not only a transfer, this is a planned project. It's the recommendation from the Home minister. I also read about that LSD case in daily. - Mr. Rudhran. - Sir. Have you joined at N4 station immediately? Did everyone there get along well with you? Or any other problem? No problem, sir. As soon as I received the transfer order, I took charge as Inspector, sir. Good morning! Good morning. Sir, this way to your room. Sir, I'm Jaya Chandran, I have been here as SI for the past seven years. Ask writer Joseph sir to come. Yes, sir. Sir! Joseph Durai, I have been at this same station for twenty five years. Top most DSR (Daily Situation Report), but I'm a local. I can ascertain by seeing you. Sir, I meant that I'm from a local town. I too meant the same. It's okay, sir.

Sir, I know the reason why you've been transferred here. Sir, shall I paste the Coastal area map details in your room? Ask the people in the Goondas list to come. I want to meet them. Sir, two local politicians have come to honour you. Tell them it's not possible now. Instead ask all the party politicians to come on sunday. I'll meet them all together. Sir, this way. This is the traffic section. This is all about our entire station. - Sir, take your phone. - Sir. Just record what I speak. Sir. My name is Rudhra Prabhakaran.

Now I'll tell you a landline number, please note down 044-42-42-424. This is the station number, if you've any problem, call me at any time. No need to tell your name, just tell me the problem. I'll do my best. Thank you. - You send this to everyone you know. - Okay, sir. - Send to the criminals without fail. - Yes, sir. So far, you'd have been stern with the public... and submissive to the criminals. Not like that anymore. In my tenure, you should be submissive to the public... and stern with the criminals. - Do you understand? - Yes, sir. N4 police station help line, how can I help you? Hello mam, four rogues are always playing cards here... and teasing the passersby filthy. Tell me which place? - Nagara garden, mam. "Everything will end at a glance" "Everything will be suppressed in a moment" Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! - Hey, run away. - Sir! Sir! "His legs runs as fast as a deer His mind is frenzied like a tiger" Tell me, granny. I sell peanuts at the railway station and survive. Two robbers snatched two thousand rupees from my pouch. "Whoever...whoever you might be, just curl your tail..." Don't hit me, sir. Sir, leave me. Leave me, sir. No, sir. Forgive me, sir. Oh, no! Sir! Take them in the vehicle. Sir, my daughter is studying 12th grade in a Government school. Everyday when she leaves from school, a guy is following her. When I enquired, he is staring me like an enemy. Don't worry, I'll take care. Hey, come here. You too come here. Get his phone. - Hey, give me the phone. Hey, what are you doing? - Hey, what is this? Sir, what app is it? It's 'Oyo' app used for booking rooms. - Is it? How dare you book room for a student? Hereafter, I shouldn't see you around. He would've screwed you. Listen to parents. Get lost. Received an order from higher officials to arrest two people under Goondas act. You are all on that list. If you want to be exempted from getting arrested, better all of you flee this town. "If you don't comply, I'll come as fire..." We can't leave this town like you said. That's why, we have decided to kill you. "If you don't comply, I'll come as fire..." How old is the girl? This scoundrel has raped a five years old girl, sir. Sorry, sir. What shall we do? He must be blazed nude, sir. Okay, do it. Sir! You do it, I'll take care. Sir! Sir! You might be a ruling party or opposite party... or a letter head party, let it be. We will give you due respect you've as a politician. Don't advocate for kidnapping, kangaroo court, women trafficking and land mafia. If you come advocating, then you'll lose your respect. I hope you'll cooperate. Thank you. Sir. Sorry sir, I'll come later. - Sir, come. Come. Be seated, sir. - Greetings! - Be seated. May I know who he is? He is Sundara pandiyan. He worked here as a SI. He retired just three years ago. He is very strict, whoever it is, he will slap first and talk later. What could I help for you now, sir? Sir, his younger daughter is eighteen years old. She has eloped with a boy. Ranger Ravi, a victim because of him having old feud in mind... He took both of them in his custody and creating turmoil. Sir, you've to save her and his family. Sir, you know very well that we can't do anything... if she turns eighteen and she likes to go. Tell me what should I do? That guy is unemployed and wandering around. I'll get my daughter married to him after two years, sir. By then, I'll settle my elder daughter. Please rescue my younger daughter, sir. What do they expect from you? They were all the ones who got thrashed by me. Now they're asking me to fall on their feet and apologize, sir. I cannot, sir. Sir, the law is not to our favour. It's favorable to them. To save your daughter, it isn't dishonour to fall on their foot. If they approach the station, then I'll be in a situation to get them married. Better fall on their feet rather than thinking of dignity. Go and do the needful to bring your daughter. Bye, sir. Lord Murugan! Protect me. Hey, being pregnant, why are you dancing like this? It might harm the baby, stop it. Hey, enough! It mught may be a risk. Dear, nothing will happen. I have already consulted the doctor. It's been six months, so yoga, exercise can be done Even I can dance. Moreover there will not be pregnancy pressure and pelvic pain also. Now why are you saying this? Dear, I was asking you to take me to Kedarnath temple, isn't it? Take me dear, please. Now you go and prepare the breakfast, let's discuss later about going to temple. - Good morning, sir. - Brother, come. - Come inside. - Sir, mam will be inside. We can't talk about this issue before mam. Tell me, did the problem got solved? Sir, they're not what you think. They're not willing to compromise. Sir, we should thrash them, Then only they'll say where the girl is. Brother, tell me clearly what has happened. Ravi, this is your wish, isn't it? Fall on his feet, sir. Why did you fall suddenly, sir? How many times have you slapped us twisting this moustache? Better shave your moustache and come again... - Ravi, this is very wrong! - What is wrong? The girl is in my custody only upon her consent. Better leave, sir. Being elder he fell on his feet, but he grabbed his moustache and asking to shave off and come. I have become old, if not I'd have banged him. Brother, there is no other way. Let it be as she eloped. Think that you've only one daughter and live the rest of your life. Brother... That's not necessary. Brother, you take him to the station, lodge a complaint... that his daughter is missing and register a FIR. - Brother! - Do as I said. Register the FIR, I'll take care of the rest. Go. Brother, come let's go. Sir, why have you come? If you had informed, I'd have come. Other day I called for a meeting at station and respectfully told everyone not to do this. It seems you told him to shave off the moustache and fall on your feet. Can you talk about the moustache, Ravi? Better send the girl with me. You don't involve in this issue. Then it'll become an unnecessary problem. I have come to face the problem. Shall we confront? Hey, I'm not scared to restrain. Hey... "His way of searching is a new strategy" "If you know it, your stamina will stumble and rumble" "He will hit you His anger turns furious" "You're so pity" "He will keep you clear, bang you and drag on to the street." "Everything will end at a glance" "Everything will be suppressed in a moment" "His legs runs as fast as a deer" "His mind is frenzied like a tiger" "Whoever...whoever you might be, just curl your tail..." Shiva! Go bring the girl. Hey, go! Hey, why are you in hurry to get married on third day of becoming a major? Her father didn't accept our love that's why, sir. How much are you earning? - I'm searching for a job. You need income to take care of yourselves, isn't it? What? She has an elder sister who is yet to get married. Eloping being a major may be legally justified, But it isn't fair according to Dharma. You get a job, I'll speak to her father. Is it okay? What do you say? Sorry, sir. I'll wait. Sir, I made a mistake without thinking about all these problems. Okay. - Sorry, sir. Check and allocate the night duty. - Okay, sir. Just a minute. - Okay, sir. you inform. Sir, tell me. A smuggler from Srilanka... ...with the help of some politicians here, he is going to smuggle drugs, we got this information from IS. Okay, sir. With regard to this Mr. Pratap singh from Narcotics department will meet you. Okay, I'll recive him sir. Rudhran, this execution should create panic among the entire drug mafia. - Give a try! - Sure sir, I'll do my best. He is Mr. Pratap Singh from Narcotics department. He is John from Cyber crime. Manoj from Crime branch. Ravi Varma from Coast guard. Anwar from Intelligence service. And he is Mr.Joseph, sir. A very well experienced writer. You can take from here. Well, N4 team! recently we seized two tons of drugs at Andhra. Good news for us on the first day of the operation. And one more team will be covering Trichy airport. If you block the ways leading to Chennai Harbour... and stop them, we can catch them easily. Total mafia will get panicked. Well, the name of this operation is, 'DAD' - 'DAD'- Drive Against Drugs. If this team does the searching properly without getting corrupted, We can finish them all. The highest sezied value in past three years is maximum 1.50 crores, sir. But in media, only 70 to 80 lakhs are revealed. Politicians and police officers are involved in this, sir. Mostly, they're transferring powdered kind of drugs, sir. But amphetamine, cocaine, heroin, LSD, methadone... and morphine are smuggled in crystal based. All the details pertaining to this is in this file, sir. Sir, from the installed CCTV camera, we didn't find any unusual activity footage. The details I got with regard to boat owners list and call tracking details, I have submitted to Manoj, sir. - Yes, sir. As far as my knowledge, the boat owners here are not connected with smuggling, sir. The drugs must be smuggled through outside boats as if bringing fish. From the top smuggler..., fish is supplied here to one of his partner through a container. We have traced the clue, sir. That's a good clue, Joseph sir. If we find who is the fish exporter... and lift the container driver, the issue will end. Yes, sir. We got so much details. Surely we can catch them. Hey, I have got the doctor's appointment to take scan this sunday. It's easy to get doctor's appointment, but very hard to get your appointment. Why not for you, dear? Tell me, sir. Sir, I have forwarded a photo on WhatsApp. Please, look at it. - Just a moment. Bring the sweetie who is with Ravi. Let's bang him. Okay, sir. Who is that sweetie, dear? What do you plan to do tonight? If you try for other option since I'm pregnant, that's it. I'll kill you. Hey, it's regarding job and sweetie is an accused. Okay, I believe you. Rathnaswamy! Rathnaswamy, can you hear me? - Who do you want, sir? - I'm Joseph from N4 police station. Don't you recognise me? You're not fit to be a driver. - What's the problem, sir? - There isn't any problem. I came this way, I felt hungry. Your wife has made idly and gravy, isn't it? Can you ask her to bring? - Sir, are you trying to scare me? - Hey, I swear I'm feeling hungry. Better call your wife and check. Hey, call her. Selvi! Why there isn't any reply? Call your daughter. Aish... Where are you both? If you call, they'll not come. Let me call them. Selvi, get me idly and gravy. - You go. - Yes, sir. Little one, you go. Sir, who are they? Where is my wife and daughter? Sir, what do you want? - Good, you understood. - Sir. Rathnam, are you good? I just need a confidential information. Just an information. If you tell on your own, I'll provide you groceries, electricity bill, your daughter's school fee for one year. Even I'll get the medical expenses for your wife free from the Government. If you deny you don't know anything, Then for the crime you've commited, I'll frame your wife and daughter have sold drugs on the road, ...file NDPS case and arrest both of them. It'll take three months to take bail, Rathnam. - What have you decided? - I swear, I don't know anything, sir. Sir, please leave me. - Joseph sir. - Sir! Close the door for five minutes and ensure no one comes inside. - Okay, sir. - Sir. Sir! - Joseph sir. - Coming, sir. Why do you've this stubbornness at the age of fifty? We have planned and came inside. Can't you understand? I assure no one will know that you gave the information, understand? Sir! Nowadays, we don't talk over phone. We communicate through a game PubG. They said the cargo is arriving this week at Kasimedu harbour. But I don't know the date, sir. So you communicate through Pubg, right? Till you know the date, he'll be staying with you. Okay, sir. If you tell this to anyone, think about the consequence to your wife and daughter. - Sir... - Have an eye on him. Okay, sir. Go and sit. - Enough, get the gravy. - Okay, I'll bring. Brother, you're having food in my house for the first time. Yes, sir. I'm bit shy. I have not been to anyone's house. You call me 'sir' when I'm in work, and 'brother' when being casual. I like it, sir. Sir, I received a message from that team. Asking to login to the game. - Login to the game. Tomorrow morning a boat will leave Rameshwaram... with goods via Gulf of mannar and reach Kasimedu harbour. Take a container and get the goods cleared. Be careful with the police. Eat, brother. Enough, dear. How does it taste, brother? It has been seventeen years since I ate like this. Sister has cooked similar to what my wife cooks, sir. Anwar is calling. Tell me, bhai. Sir, got an informtion that goods are getting exchanged tomorrow at 11 a.m Goods are reaching the destination in a boat from Rameshwaram. Boat number is 1774, green colour. Okay. - Brother. - Yes, sir. Ask our squad to assemble in the spot tomorrow. I'll reach the spot by seven. - Okay, sir. Varma, sir. How many gates are here totally? For unloading the fish, there are six gates in Kasimedu. This is the main entrance channel, which leads to the six gates, sir. Then monitor closely all the boats coming through this channel. - Go... - Okay, sir. Sir, a boat is arriving with number 1774, same green colour. Ask our boat driver to go near that boat. Hey, Viji brother! Someone is watching our boat. - Come here. Look there! - Ask him to go left. - Hey, stop the boat. You're right, don't know whether they're cops or some other gang. Just leave it, if any problem arises, I'll take care of it. Brother, you said cops will not come and brought me here. I have a family. Why did you get this guy? They'll get us caught. There is stuff inside. If anyone tries to disclose out of fear and get us caught, I'll kill you. I'll look to you later. Sir, couldn't find anything. - Check in the basement. - Okay, sir. Show me your ID. Hey, who are you? Why should I show you? I'm Police inspector from N4 police station. Show me. Brother, he is asking for ID card! - Hey, show the ID. - Manoj sir. - Sir. Verify the ID cards. - Okay, sir. It's very wrong searching the boat, sir. This will become a issue if the association gets to know. There isn't fish in the boat and you didn't go for fishing, Then from where the boat is coming? Sir, the boat had engine fault, so went to Cuddalore to get it repaired. This happens at times, sir. Sir, the ID cards you've forwaded for checking... Yes, sir. Only two are original, rest two are fake, sir. Thank you, sir. You'll face unnecessary issues Sir, these two are original and these two are fake. Sir, searched all the four tins. Couldn't find anything. - Manoj sir. - Yes, sir. - Take these two guys behind. - Hey, go. Sir, why are you taking us? Go. - Leave us, sir. - Why are you hitting us? - Sir! - Hey, kneel down. Sir! sir! Sir, I don't know anything. Please, sir. Sir, I have a family. Sir! Sir, no sir! Please sir! Please don't shoot me, sir! Sir, please don't shoot me. I plead you. Hey, you tell me. Okay sir, I'll tell you. Brother, greetings! Brother asked me to come. You're Chezhiyan, right? - Yes, brother. - Wait here. - Okay, brother. I'll inform. Brother, you had asked Chezhiyan to come. He is waiting outside. - Ask him to wait. - Okay, brother. - Hey Chezhiyan, how are you? - I'm doing well with your blessings. - Good footfall for the meetings now. - Yeah, I've seen the videos. I told you to speak about caste and religious problem, isn't it? Instead, you’re speaking about Ceylon Tamils and their problems furiously. Why are you doing this? I have created hundreds of people like you with hundreds of ideologies. If you act as you wish, then why should I? Brother, let me quit. I'll do something alone. Though talking for years together, no one had done anything for those people. I'm going to fight for those people. I have to decide who should talk on politics and what to protest about. Nothing you can decide, do you understand? I shouldn't see you in again in any of the meetings. If I see you... I'll blaze you and host a bravely death. Do you understand? Brother, call from Srilanka. Hello! Sir, I'm Dissanayake speaking. The stuff has been seized by the cops.. - You mean our stuff? - Yes, sir. Which place? At North chennai, Kasimedu harbour, sir.

Go to the station and give the phone to him. I'll speak to him. Okay, boss. He is unfit for the name 'Ranger Ravi'. Good for nothing. Why do I have him as District secretary? Brother, he is good enough. He is selling stuff for thirty lakhs every month. You speak to the inspector. If you speak... Sir, Greetings! Ravi, sir! Greetings. Jayaraman, order a tea for sir.

This is my gift. Hey! Bloody hell, he blazed it. Scoundrel, he blazed 200 crores worth stuff. When he spoke so calmly, I suspect something is wrong. Now what will I answer? Hey you scoundrel, Rudhra Prabhakaran! Hey, I must kill him. Shouldn't spare him. He must regret in agony for what he has done. He must regret. You scoundrel Rudhra Prabhakaran, you're dead. - Dad, I'll go and check who is it! - Go check. My Dear! Great, Dear. - What? - Watched your interview on TV. You spoke well.

Do you know it's a loss of 200 crores? For whom? For my client. For me, I lost my commission. Forty crores! I don't mind losing the money, I'll earn in other way..

Sir, there's nothing in it. - Sir. - Sir. Inform the patrol to come. Sir… Please, sir. Sir, please don't. Sir, please leave us. Henceforth, we will not sell. Sir, we did this by mistake. Hello, SI sir. Where are you? Sir, please leave us. Sir, we'll not do this again. Sir, two guys were caught red handed selling stuff. - Sir, please. - You come immediately. - Sir, please don't. - Hey! How long will it take to reach here? - Please, sir. - In another five minutes! - Sir, please. - Sir, come to Sivagami market. Sir, please. This will weigh more than half a kilo. This is a commercial case. Take them to the station and file a FIR. - Sir, please. - I'll come and remand them. - Take care. - Sir. I'll have lunch and come to the station. - You leave, sir. - Sir, we will not do this again. Hey, shut up. Hey, stop. Hey, come let's go. Get on to the vehicle. Hey, come. - Hey, someone catch them. - Get on to the vehicle. - Sir. - They are escaping. - Hey, start the vehicle. Sir. Sir, catch them. Hey, keep going! Go faster! Go on! Go on! Hey, he is close to us, go fast. Keep going. Go on! Go on! Go! Go on! Go! Hey!. Hey, you scoundrels. Oh, God! - Are you okay? Is everything fine? - Not to worry, sir. Is it painful? Hey! Senseless. Go on. Hey, go on. Keep going. Go on. Hey! Go on. Get up, be careful, slowly. Sir. Come...come... Sir, just a minute. - Take care of them. - Okay, sir. Doctor! - Hey, in which subject have you failed? - English and Maths? - Are you doing any other job? - No. For pocket money, you sell packs! - Doctor, it's hurting. - Get me the guaze. Hey, listen to me. I'll be coming late. You eat. Okay, I'll try to come as soon as possible. Doctor, hope the boys are fine. One boy has mild injury, another boy has a deep injury, since he fell from the bike without wearing a helmet. I have put thirteen sutures, he should be taken care. - Else he might get infected. - Okay, doctor. - Otherwise X-ray and CT scan is normal. - Okay, doctor. - Nothing to worry. - Thanks, doctor. - Okay. - Joseph sir. Sir. Take the boys to the station. Call their parents and ask them to come. I'll come and meet them. - Okay, sir. I'll go home and come. - Okay, sir. Already you've come late. What are you thinking without eating? - Eat, dear. - Did you eat? Not yet. - Just had pomegranate juice. - You sit, first. Dear, what happened? Your face looks dull. - What's the problem today? - No problem as such, Varahi. But anger. I'm angry on myself. I'm furious on my anger. I can't understand, dear. Explain in the way I can understand. I received a complaint that two boys were selling stuff on the road. Myself and Joseph brother went to the spot. Before the jeep arrived, the boys pushed Joseph and started to run. They frightened a pregnant woman while escaping. To catch them, I chased their bike and kicked at one point. They hit the divider and got badly injured and bleeding. Thirteen stitches on the head. Even took scan and checked. Luckily nothing serious. If anything had happened to the boy! He is a young boy. I could've noted the bike number and have arrested them later. - Don't know why I'm getting so angry. - Don't get tensed, dear. When they pushed the pregnant woman, you would've thought about me. That's common, dear. You did your duty, isn't it? Relax and eat. The boy didn't have any complications except head injury. If anything seriously had happened? Who is answerable? This is how my job is. Nothing serious has happened. Relax and eat, dear. Greetings, sir. - Greetings, sir. Who are these people? - The parents of those boys. Sit down. I'll come back. - Okay, sir. - You're young. Sir. Be seated. Hey, is it very painful? No sir, it's okay. He is an elderly person, isn't it? You pushed him and flee. If something had happened to the pregnant woman, think of the consequences. Don't you even think for a moment the aftermath of deceiving the police. At this age you're fearless, whether it's inspector... or a collector, just taking a chance, right? Nothing like that, sir. We have escaped in fear, sir. We didn't do it with pride. Is it true? Won't sir talk? Sir, we tried to escape fearing FIR and remanding. Henceforth we will not do this, sir. Pardon us one last time, please sir. Sir, they're good boys. His brother Anbu, he is a crook. That's why these boys got spoiled. Pity their parents, they're crying outside. Okay, bring them out. - Hey, come. Come. - Oh, no! my son! - Just wait. Do you know what did your sons did? They were selling stuff in the market. Are they selling with your knowledge? Won't you raise your children properly? Hey, what's this? They're good boys and clever too. Their fathers died of addiction to alcohol. - Like them, these boys aren't listening us. - We work for daily wages, sir. Expecting at least they will study and take care of us. But these boys are also doing the same, sir. Unable to bear this, sir. You should take care of the boys duly. The court will not accept if you say they got spoiled because of their dad. If they go to prison, they will only have bad company and ruin their life. Since this is the first time, I'm lodging a petty case as smoking and imposing thousand rupees fine for each. Pay the money and take them. Sir, we haven't got the money now. Okay, I'll pay the fine. While catching them, they got injured on the head and legs. I took them to the hospital and checked thoroughly. Doctors said they're fine but not to get wet for ten days. Hey, if I again catch you in drugs case, I'll break your legs and paralyze, understand? Sir, get the signature and send them. - Okay, sir. - Mam. - Is it paining, dear? If it is someone else, they would've filed a case and remanded. Which inspector will pay the fine himself and send you out? Henceforth, be good. You come and sign. Sign here. Very unfortunate, Mr. Rudhran! What I can understand is that you had good intention to help them. Then how did such a problem has raised? Sir, upon god I sent them in order to do good to them. But, I never thought such an incident would happen after that. Maran! Mom, why is he still sleeping? He is sleeping unaware of his attires slipping. Don't know what he did at night! - Go, wake him up. - I'll wake him up, mom. Maran! Mom, he has pissed on the bed. Come and see here. - Maran! - Hey, what are you saying? My son never does it. - Hey! - My dear. - Maran! - Yes. - He has pissed. - Hey! Hey, buffalo! - Hey! - Maran! Hey! - What's this? - Turn him around. - Oh, no! - Hey, Maran! Looks my son has got seizures. Hey, take the keys. My son! What happened? Hey, get the keys fast. What are you searching! If you can't find the keys, find an iron metal. Mom, keys isn't here! Hey, fetch an auto and come. Maran! Something has happened to my son. Someone please come fast. My son is struggling. - Hey! - Lift him. My son. Look here. Hey, hold him safe. Don't know what happened to my son. - Hurry up! - Brother, please carry safely. - Be careful. - My son. My son, what happened to you? Why are you scaring mom? Maran! Hey, call brother and ask him to come immediately to the hospital. I'll call right now, mom. Hello! Brother, Maran got seizures. We're going to the hospital. You come immediately to GH. Please, drive fast, my son is unconscious. My son, can you hear me talking? Hey, Anbu! - Hey, come. Hold your brother. - Come, lift! - Lift him. - Hey, hold him. - Be careful. Be careful.. Keep moving. You'll be alright, my son. Hey! Sir, suddenly my son got seizures. My God! My son, look at your mom. The boy who got injured on the head last week, right? Yes, doctor. - Yes, sir. I told to be careful without getting infection, isn't it? - The pulse is totally down. - Doctor, what are you saying? You might have brought him soon. What is he saying? - Brother is dead, mom. - Hey, what are you saying? What are you saying! Is my son dead? Mom, the cop hit and killed him. The cop hit and killed my son. - You're dead in this young age! - I'll kill him. Maran is dead. - Dear, come let's do pooja. - I've done, you proceed. (Chanting mantra) Oh, no! Hey, wait I'll come. Hey, wait. - Don't you keep carefully! - Dear, it got slipped by mistake. I don't feel good as this happened on a New moon day. Today you stay with me without going anywhere. Hey, don't get panic for all this. Lord Shiva will take care of us. Don't be afraid. I can't take leave as you think. I'm leaving to duty, send the lunch to station. Sir, a life has been lost from our side. Please don't leave him just because he belongs to your department. If you don't take proper action in this case, then we will protest. Okay, I'll take care. You may go. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir. Tell me, sir. - Rudhran! - Yes, sir. Last week did you chase, kicked the bike and caught a boy called Maran? Yes, sir. They were selling stuff at the market. When about to catch them, they pushed the writer and escaped. I chased and caught them, but a small accident took place. Any problem, sir? The boy had seizures and died this morning. Regarding this, Maran's brother has given a petition to take action on you. Sir, I didn't do anything... Okay, unfortunately this has happened. Don't panic, I'll handle this case. The department will support you. Don't come to the station unless I tell. You leave immediately. - Okay, sir. Sir, the case about the boys coming inside the harbour... Sir! Sir! We chased and caught the boys selling stuff, isn't it? Yes, the boys in the quarters, Maran and Mathi. Maran got seizures and died. My lord! He is too young, sir. Just now a complaint has been received at DC office. I have been instructed not to go out anywhere and be at home. Sir, what's this! The doctor told there was no problem... when we took the scan at the hospital that day. Even we sent him safely with his mother. Sir, no problem from our side. Sir, you do as what DC said. I'll update what's happening here. Okay, sir. I'll leave. Why is this ordeal for a good person! He is my brother Maran, eighteen years old. Since he was smoking on the road on 16th, N4 station Inspector Rudhra Prabhakaran had called and threatened him. When he chased my brother and kicked his bike, my brother fell down. He was taken to hospital but not given proper first aid. He had thirteen sutures on the head, then taken to station. A case was filed after four hours and then he was sent home. Today morning my brother got seizures and died in the government hospital. The cop having grudge on my brother hit him to death. I have lodged a complaint with DC sir. I need justice for my brother's death. For the arrogance caused by the cops, I request the people for getting me justice. You know the arrogance of the cops. The boy belongs to a poor family. Only the media people like you can reach out this news to the public. I'll send the complaint copy to all by WhatsApp. Thank you. Who is it...! Dear, why have you came early today? Other day, I told about chasing a boy and kicked him from bike, isn't it? Yes. Today he got seizures and died. Pity him, he is too young. Dear, I'm getting scared. At this stance, you shouldn't get tensed. DC sir called and said he'll take care whatever the problem is. He asked me to stay home. Then, will you lose your job? What if I lose the job, when a life is lost. Leave me alone for some time. We need justice! Need justice for Maran's death! Arrest him! Arrest Inspector Rudhran! Arrest him! Arrest Inspector Rudhran! Arrest him! - Silence, please. Silence, please. What's the problem? Why all of you've gathered here? Any one of you explain. Inspector Rudhran was responsible for my brother's death... and we have already lodged a complaint with the DC office. But the inspector is yet to be arrested. We will be here until the inspector is arrested. Not only that, if you try to decieve us by doing autopsy without our permission... ...Then this protest will be more intense. Give your request as a petition, I'll investigate and do the needful to get justice, okay? Thank you, sir. Arrange to give them protection. Sir, to withdraw the protest, what should the Government do? Only if the Inspector is arrested, we will allow to do the autopsy. Otherwise we will continue the protest till he gets arrested. Now, they have conveyed their demands. Let's wait and watch, what the Tamilnadu Police department will decide. To Golden media viewers, our greetings. Now I'm at the protest venue and this is a live telecast. As a journalist, I should share this news with you. On the day of the incident, Maran was smoking at a public place. When Inspector Rudhran was about to arrest him, Maran tried to escaped on a bike. So, Inspector Rudhran was forced to kick him down. We all believe this is the fact. But, that isn't true. When the incident took place, the back of the T-shirt worn... by Maran was said to have the image of Ambedkar. Watching this, to emphazise his caste violence, the Inspector left Maran to escape... ...then chased him and kicked him down. This is how the message is revealed. It's a known fact that cops give importance to their caste. And it is noteworthy that the Inspector Rudhran is from Dharmapuri district. As a journalist, I request the police to investigate.... the case in view of the caste, from now on. A video released on You tube has created havoc among the public. In this video, it has been reported... that Maran was racially harassed and hit by Inspector Rudhran. The public have been protesting after the video went viral. Arrest him! Arrest Rudhran! My son, even if we make a mistake without realising it, we've to bear the punishment. Dear! Come, brother. Be seated. What's this, sir? We did our duty, isn't it? They say that you've kicked him on casteism, so PCR act must be filed. Sir, shall we release the video I took on that day? Then things will settle down. Brother, why are you talking without understanding? We closed the case by ourselves saying they smoked in public, isn't it? If we say they sold stuff, people will not believe us. No need to do all that, brother. Was there any image of political leader on back of his T-shirt? I didn't notice it properly. - I saw only his front. I didn't notice his back. Even if it was there, your intention was not that. I'm with you, don't I know about you! Someone is deliberately stirring this up. But anyway, it's my fault. I shouldn't have kicked the bike. Sir, this is what he is saying repeatedly. I'm getting scared. Rather others saying that he killed, he himself will say. Dear, if you tell someone like this, I swear I'll never be with you. Already I have no peace of mind being a cop's wife. Being wife of a murderer will be hell. Lord Shiva! My child shouldn't be born in this world as a murderer's child, dear. Please understand, you just did your duty. If he got injured, that's due to his fate. If you say anyone that you're the reason for his death, Then I don't know what I'll do... Mam, what are you saying? Why to say as murderer's child and all... Nothing will happen as you fear. Sir has great support from higher officials. Mam, be courageous. Sir, let us accept what's coming in our way. Don't make any mistake by deciding yourself that you're guilty. I'm telling you as a brother. Be little patient, good things will happen, sir. The protest against Maran's death continues tonight. Will the District Collector heed their demand? Will their demands be met tomorrow? Let's wait and watch. This is Aarthi for Thanthi TV. The hot topic in dailies, news channels and social websites is about Maran's death. The protest by Maran's friends and family continues for second day. It has been reported that various political party leaders... are arriving today to support them. Greetings! - Mom, get up. Be seated. I'll surely get your demand fulfilled. Is it okay? On behalf of our party, we extend our deepest condolences... to Maran who lost his life in police attack. Our party will support for the protest. Our party has given five lakhs as relief fund to his family. Our party will do the neccessary help to their family. Thank you. Greetings, brother! They killed my son. You've to get me justice. A youth has been killed unjustly. Discrimination in the police department over caste is increasing day by day. The inspector assaulted the boy to death for casteism. He should be prosecuted under violence act and severe action should be taken. The department should take action and dismiss the inspector. The deased family should be given 50 lakhs as relief fund. And Government job should be given to a person of that family. Until all of these requests are met, I'll support these people to fight. Thank you. What happened, dear? I couldn't bear to see you sitting like this. Don't think too much and get confused. Please! The Government has accepted your request. Okay, sir. Twenty lakhs financial assistance to Maran's family... and a government job to someone in the family. Inspector Rudhran Prabhakaran has been suspended... and an inquiry commission has been formed against him. Sir, that isn't enough. Rudhran Prabhakaran should be arrested under Prevention of violence act. Only then we will disperse from here. Sir, it'll not happen immediately as you say. Autopsy will take place in another two hours in the presence of RDO. Only after getting the report, any legal action can be taken. The Tamil Nadu government and the police will definitely... do the needful to get justice for this family. Okay sir, we believe you. We will wait till the autopsy gets over. We need justice, if not we will come back again and protest. Definitely we will take action, you leave now. Police Inspector Rudhra Prabhakaran has been sacked... in connection with Maran's murder case. Autopsy will be conducted in two hours, the police said. Twenty lakhs relief to the affected family... Dear, sit down. Tell me. I know where are you going. Don't get stressed, unnecessarily. No one can live in this world as very fair and honest. Beyond being fair and honest, I have become a sinner. I'll go meet DC sir and check what to be done next. So, you will not listen to me, right? Even if it's not for me, just listen to what I say for sake of our child. Don't I wish you should be the first one to cuddle our baby? If you still want to go, You can. But forget me and my child. Sir! Sir, why did you come here? If any of the media or press see you, It'll be a problem. No problem, sir. I'm not able to stay peacefully. Not able to conclude anything, sir. I chased the boy, caught him and he got injured, everything was true. But I couldn't do anything without knowing if this had anything to do with his death. Sir, I feel very guilty. I know the reason for what you've come. In another ten minutes, autopsy will commence. Will know the result in an hour. You better wait, sir. I'll inform DC that you've come. Come, let's go. The doctors have arrived. Sir. Be seated. Rudhran, I told you not to come out. Why did you come? Sir, I'm not able to stay peacefully. I'll see the report and leave. You've helped me a lot. Thank you, sir. Rudhran, it's not an usual case. But PCR case. The entire department knew your intention wasn't to kill the boy. A huge political drama is being portrayed with the boy's death. Unnecessarily, you don't get involved and become a victim, better be careful. Sir, I'm ready to face the consequences. Sir, my only concern is whether the boy died due to head injury. I'll check the report and leave, sir. Please. Okay, let's wait. Greetings, DC sir. - Greetings, sir. What the report says, sir? There is drug content in his body. But it's full potency is not known as it has been 48 hours. Not only that, he has no previous medical history. The boy was healthy. Then how did he get seizures, sir? That might be due to genetic reason. He had already taken drugs, he might had seizures by colliding on the wall. But there is no such injury. Due to head injury, the sutures might have got infected and the brain cells would've been defused. Then there are chances for seizures. Any one of the said reasons might be the cause. That has to investigated by the court and decide. Sorry to interrupt, sir. Tell me straight away, sir. Was it due to the head injury, he got infected and got seizures? Sir, we can't say authentically because of this he got seizures. The injured area has been infected slightly. That also might be a reason, but as a doctor I can't certify only that as a reason. So he has an infection. - Yes, slightly got infected. Sir, just a moment. Excuse me, sir. Tell me, Rudhran. - Sir, I admit I'm guilty. I'll take full responsibility for his death, sir. Please, sir. You produce me before the court, sir. Rudhran, I say you again Already the whole media has influenced, that you've killed the boy because of caste. ...And public also believes it. If legal action has to be taken, then PCR case has to be filed on you. The autopsy report is in favour of you. Then why do you hurry? Sir, let the court decide whether I'm guilty or not. Sir, the phone calls, social media, press and beyond that my self- guiltyness I'm not able to handle it. Please, sir... Please accept my request to surrender. Okay, you need not surrender, let the court decide. You may leave now. I'll come and arrest you. Rudhran, you know the difference between surrendering and getting arrested. Listen to me, you leave now. Okay, sir. Sir, it has been six months since I came to prison. My wife hasn't come yet to see me. She is so angry on me. Even I came to know about my child's birth through my sister. I feel very bad. Sir, we can't find honest officers like you these days. Since you felt guilty, you voluntarily surrendered in this case. Whatever you said, I'll submit it as a report to Judge mam. But I'm not able to understand one thing. I'm not able to sense anywhere that you handled this case related to caste. Your side is very clear. - Sir, caste issue isn't a problem. Because I'm not that sort of person. Something went wrong. All I want is to know whether the boy died due to accident, sir. That is upto the court to decide. I'll leave now with a good news to you. The Judge mam has approved your bail and sent me here. Today evening the order will reach the jailer. Tomorrow you can go home. Be happy with your family, sir. Handle this case bravely. Your lawyer Indrasena is very brilliant. He will argue well. As a lawyer, I'm telling you, definitely you will get justice. And as a well wisher, I'm telling you. Mr. Rudhran take care. Take care. - Thank you, sir. Sister. - Rudhran, how are you? Come inside. Sit! I'll get you water to drink. - Okay, sister. Hello, uncle! How are you? Good, how are you? I'm good. It's an important game, I'll go. Take it. - Thank you, sister. Uncle! Hey, how are you? - I’m good, uncle. Are you studying well? - Yes, uncle. Okay. You go inside and study. They said you'll come out in a month, but it's been six months. You've become skinny. Because of the nature of case. Sister, Varahi never came to meet me when I was in prison. How is my baby? Did you see? Your daughter resembles you. I went and saw her. She is so angry on you, since you didn't listen to her. Everything will be fine once you go and meet her. Okay sister, I'll go. Can you speak to her now over phone for my sake? Okay, I'll speak definitely. - Okay sister, I'm leaving. Why don't you eat and leave? I'll eat on the way. I'm leaving. Come, my son- in- law! How are you? Varahi, see who has come!!! Please forgive me. Varahi stopped me not to see you. I came to know about you through the advocate. Still she is angry on you. You've to talk to her and ease. Come inside, son- in- law. Dad, please send him away. Dear, what are you talking? This is wrong. Whatever it is, let's talk inside the house. You come inside. If you want me and baby to be good, you better be quiet, dad. I'll speak to him. Why did you come here? Have you come to see whether my child and I are alive or dead? Varahi, my stance on that day was worse. The pricking I had, that's why... I begged you to stay with me and not to step out of the house, you didn't listen. Your problem is more important to you than all of us, isn't it? You left my child to be born in this world as the child of a murderer. Why have you come to see us now? Varahi, I'm not justifying what I did was right. You will understand everything when the verdict comes in this case. What to understand? The people have branded you as caste fanatic, do you know that? How will that blame wane? My child will be blamed that his father was imprisoned when he was born. How can it be erased? I understand your anger. I'll finish this case and explain everything. Do understand, Let me see the child once, please. Dear, what you do is literally wrong. He is already very depressed, let him come inside and see the child. Come, son- in- law. You come. If he steps inside, myself and the child will not be alive. He left without any concern on me and the child. This is the punishment for it. Go away. Varahi! - Please, go away. "Dear, what did you do to me? " "You slashed me into pieces... " "My life is killing me " "My heart is writhing " "It's crushing me " "When heeding your words " "Floods are hitting " "It's tearing my heart " "It's suffering with pain " "When heeding your words " "You told me to go away... " "Where would I go now? " "You told me to go away... " "Where would I go now? " "The infant did not see me That pain has not gone yet " "Give me a way to see my angel, blessed by God, my dear! " "I'm burning in the pouring rain I'm melting down inside " "I'm boiling in the cold water I think when you were next to me " "You throw the arrow swiftly on the wound " "You're killing me " "You're holding a knife in your words " "What are you still going to do to me? " "I don't have the heart to endure it " "Dear, what did you do to me? " "You slashed me into pieces... " "My life is killing me " "My heart is writhing " "It's crushing me " "When heeding your words " "Floods are hitting " "It's tearing my heart " "It's suffering with pain " "When heeding your words " "You told me to go away... " "Where would I go now? " "You told me to go away... " "Where would I go now? " I went to meet mam. She is also depressed. The pain in the words uttered by the people is more than the anger she has on you. Whoever blamed that you're a caste fanatic and new born's fortune wasn't good... I'll make them to say that you're innocent... and walked out free since new born's fortune is good. It’s in your hand only, sir. Let's talk about this to advocate... Just a second, sir. Tell me, sister. - Where are you? I'm at home town. - Dharsan got seizured suddenly. Oh, no! what are saying? - Suddenly he got seizures. I have admitted him at Rama Rao hospital. You start immediately. Okay, I'll start immediately. - Okay. What happened, sir! I have to leave now to the hospital. It's urgent, please come. Brother! - Sister, what happened? He said he has headache. While applying medicine, he got seizures. I'm very afraid. I haven't informed in- law yet. What did the doctor say? He says something scary. - Don't get panic. Sir, let's go meet the doctor. - Okay, sit down. Greetings, doctor. - Greetings, doctor. I'm Dharsan's uncle, how is he now? They've brought him here at the right time. He is okay now. But he should take medicines definitely for a year. He never had seizures. What's the reason, doctor? This is a normal problem among the youngsters these days. Addiction to drugs and games. He is addicted to the game PUBG. To stay awake the whole night and to play, regularly he has used a drug 'cool lip'. That has damaged his nervous system. It has alerted with seizures. So, if the usage of drugs is more, then there is chance of getting seizures, right? Definitely. The nervous system in the brain can bear ecstasy to a certain level. If the dosage increases, this may happen again. If the children sleep unnecessarily at day, then parents should question them. It might be due to game or drug addiction. It's the duty of the parents to safe guard the next generation. Doctor, is this curable? Yes, it's curable. There is a rehabilitation center for drug addicts at Chengalpattu. He will get better if he gets treatment there for a month. Okay, doctor. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Joseph brother. I have to meet Maran's mother. Take me to her house. This isn't the right time to go to their house. Everyone will be furious on you. Whatever happens, I should meet her. Sukumar! - Greetings, sir. Have you told her? Shall we go? - Yes, let's go. Come. Come, sir. This is her house. She has left to fetch water. I'll go bring her. You go upstairs and sit. - Sir. Sir, this photo... Brother, be calm. - Okay, sir. Greetings! - Greetings, sir. Come, sit down. Inspector wanted to meet you. That's why, I brought him here. Maa, first forgive me. I shouldn't have chased Maran enraged. I would've controlled myself. Please forgive me. Sir, why are you asking to forgive? Sir, I'm not angry on you. My anger is only on my elder son. Had he not taught the habit of selling drugs, He wouldn't have come to sell drugs nor would've you chased him. Did the Government pay the money what they promised? Sir, a sum of thirty five lakhs was given by the Government and political parties. My elder son took all the money. I'm awaiting for my death. Whatever help you need, please ask Joseph sir. I'll ask him to do the needful. - It's okay, sir. Sukumar told me that you suffer not being able to see your child yet. You will see your baby very soon. I'll pray to the lord, sir. You have a generous heart, god will bless you. Sir, shall we leave? - Just a moment, sir. I want to ask you an important question. Has anyone in your family had seizures? As far as I know, none of our family members had seizures. Okay, we're leaving. Let's go, sir. - We're leaving. Okay, sir. - Sukumar. - Tell me, sir. We spoke to her. Where is Mathi, who accompanies Maran always. He will be on terrace, shall I go get him? We will go and meet him. Sir! - Hey, Mathi! - Sir! Hey...hey... - We will not hurt you. - Sir! Need to talk with you, that's all. Sir, I didn't commit any mistake. Hey listen, nobody said you've commited mistake. I know Maran's death is not due to head injury. Hey, you need not tell the truth to save me. But to save others like your friend Maran, you've to tell me the truth. Friends only know about each other. We will ensure your safety. - Tell us, dear. - Sir, I'll tell you. But you've to ensure safety for my mother and sister. Whatever may be the problem, I'll support you. Tell me boldly. Sir, after we got caught, we were scared and decided to do some other business. Dude, henceforth I'll not come to sell drugs. Got humiliated. We sold for fun and enjoyed well. Enough, let's do something else. Dude, it won't be right, are you afraid? - Hey, shut up. What he said is right. Dude, I'm ashamed to see my mom. My mom was very upset. Tell me what business could we do? - Dude, you know corner shop Raja? - Yes. He runs a garments shop. Let's us also open a small shop and do business. Hey, this will not suit me. I'm not joining. You open the garments shop. I'll come do shopping. You might brain wash me it seems. I'm leaving, bye dude. Hey, come let's go. - Let him go. - Hey, look here. Once he steps into the police station, then he'll come looking for us. Let me know how much money we need to open a shop. I'll ask my mom. Mom, myself and Mathi are planning to open a garment shop. I need two lakhs. I'll repay within six months. Help me to get the money. Two lakhs! If you ask me suddenly, how can I get? To buy jewels for sister's marriage, I'm saving two lakhs by chit. Mom, give him the money. He has reformed and changing his life style. My marriage will happen only after two to three years. By then, he will earn and return the money. Okay, shall I take next month chit and give you? Okay, mom. You have taken a good decision! It's respectful to earn by hardwork. But how to give you two lakhs rupees? But I can manage upto one lakh. You open the shop. I'm a member of the women's self help group. I'll get money from there. Rest we will see later. - Okay, mom. - Adjust for a while. We both were planning how to arrange two lakhs, sir. That day a new product was launched. What? You brother has got some new stuff it seems. It looks like a chocolate. You too is in need of money. If the stuff is good, let's sell it and earn money. Let's try this for one last time. Come, let's do it. Are you sure? - Yes, come. - Okay, let's go. - Brother. - Tell me. You have got new stuff it seems? I'm your younger brother, you didn't even tell me. Is it fare to keep me away? Fearing the cops, if you get me caught, what could I do? It's safe to stay away from brother who stands behind You get the stuff from some one else and earn money. I'll recommend, okay? Okay, atleast show me the new stuff. - No I can't. Brother, don't create fuss. I have earned you more money, isn't it? Maran, I'm not bothered for sentiments. I'll suggest a different business for you. Hey, aren't you ashamed to talk like this to your brother? Hey, why? Hey Maran, after ten days I'll get you the stuff, mean while let the wound heal. Why unnecessarily, brother? - Hey, here is the stuff. Looks like a chocolate with good packing. Just pay fifty rupees, get the chocolate and eat. Let the sale flourish, then I'll get you the stuff. Be calm and relax. Hey, you play. - Okay, brother. Bye. - This is unwanted one. Come. Dude, why did you ask me to come at this time? Is any girl calling you for video chat? Damn it, you're always in that thinking. Come, I'll tell you. Look here. - Dude, stuff! Did your brother give? - He didn't give. I stole from him. Take it. Wow! Great stuff. For just having one, the pep is high. Dude, the ecstasy is great! I'm drowsy, if this stuff hits the market. It will sell like hot cakes. I don't feel the pep, taking two more. Do you want? I don't need, already I'm feeling someone is pushing me behind. You take care. I'm getting sloshed. Good night. - Hey, get lost. Though I resisted him, he didn't listen to me, sir. He died, sir. They had called his brother Anbu to the mortuary. Who has come from Maran's family? Hey, they're calling. You guys wait here. You come with me. Sign here. Check whether his belongings are safe. Autopsy is scheduled for tomorrow. Take care of us. - I'll do, brother. We can go, brother. Hey, this is new stuff arrived yesterday. How did he get it? I don't know, brother. Hey Mathi, come here. Come here, my dear. Let's go aside and talk. Anbu, whoever is supplying the stuff, ask them to stop it immediately. Okay, brother. - Don't sell the stuff. Okay, brother. Check with him how this has happened. Hey, where did you go last night? How did he get the stuff? Brother, I don't know. Maran got the stuff. I resisted him but he consumed too many. I don't know this chocolate will kill him. - Hey you... If you say anyone what you told me now, I'll lynch you. Not only you but your family as well. Do you understand? They threatened to kill me... if I reveal anyone that he died because of the chocolate. I swear I don't know how they locked you into this case, sir. Will you say the same in the court boldly? Sir, what if they harm us? Joseph sir. - Sir. Arrange to shift Mathi, his mother and sister to a safer place. I'll arrange, sir. - Sir, who is next? - Anbu or Ravi? Black or white? You're done. The striker is mine. No, Anbu. The striker is mine. The cop has come out in bail it seems. - What do you want? - I need to talk with you. It's wrong to come to my area to talk with me without my permission, okay? Will you go now or shall I call 100? I'm telling that I need to talk with you, do you understand? No, it won't work out it seems. Hey, he is telling, right? Go away. I'm talking to him. You shut your trap. Hit him. Hey wastrel, being the reason for your brother's death... ...you made your mother writh in pain. He is an innocent. You made him to land in prison. Do you know the reason why are you still alive? Just to get the confession from you. Shouldn't we come to the complainant? Doesn't we the cops know? Answer properly for our questions. Ask him sir. I have come here knowing that your brother died because of the narcotics chocolate... ...that you and Ranger Ravi brought to the market. How do you know Ranger Ravi? Who did you meet when you left the hospital that day? Who is behind for this blame on me? Tell all the facts properly. Let me tell you all the facts I know, sir. My mother has been working in an ice factory for 15 years. I often go there to give food to my mom. That's how, Ranger Ravi the owner of the company was known to me. Don't keep roaming around. - Okay, sir. Come and join our movement. - Okay, sir. I'll show you the way to your survival. - Okay, sir. What? - Okay, sir. That day Ravi called Mathi and enquired. - Hey, you... If you say anyone what you told me now... I'll lynch you. Not only you but your family as well. Do you understand? Hey, won't you take care of the stuff? - Sorry, boss. You've killed a guy not being aware of potency of the stuff. All of us would be arrested if the truth is revealed in autopsy. You people are grown plumpy but good for nothing. I should get the corpse without autopsy. Where is the doctor? - He is in OPD, boss. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings! Greetings, sir! I'm the District Secretary of Human rights movement, North Chennai. He is the elder brother of the young guy who died of seizure. He is a young guy, will you give the corpse without doing autopsy? He is young, that's the problem sir. You talk to a doctor at a private hospital and get a death certificate. I'll find a way for you to give the corpse without doing autopsy. Isn't there any other way, sir? This is RDO case. I have to answer many people. If ration shops all over India is closed... ...then it's a plan to make us refugees in our own land. A revolution will definitely happen. With this announcement, see you in next video, bye. Greetings, boss! Hi Ravi, you've ruined my reputation in one day which I earned in Srilanka. Tell me, if you cannot do it. There are people in Cochin. Because there are ten businesses running around this one business. You've spoiled everyone's life. All our friends are spitting on us. Do you have any plans or not? Apart from the station in our limits, I have spoken to nearby stations too. Let's start once if the deal gets done. No one can do us anything if the stuff comes to hand. It's enough if a cop takes bribe from us once. Then he'll be a slave to us all his life. Do something and bring him to me only once. Then just see what happens. What else, Ravi? Boss, that is... Hey Anbu, come here. Greetings, boss! - His name is Anbu. I know him. I have seen him in the team. Our next generation. What's the problem? We brought narcotic chocolates from North. It was new, unaware of it's potency, his brother ate five chocolates. He got seizures and died. You've killed your brother and has come to me asking for a way to escape. Oh, you sinner! The corpse is in the morgue. If autopsy is done, the reason will be revealed. If a private hospital doctor gives a certificate, ...we can take the corpse home without autopsy. What's his age? Will he be eighteen years? - Yes, eighteen years old, brother. Give it. It's him, boss. His name is Maran. If he is eighteen years old, then it's RDO case. Does anyone else in the house know about this issue? No one knows. A guy called Mathi was roaming with him. I knew only after he said. If the other guys knew, we can't finish this with a private doctor. If that guy blabbers sometime later and if his mother and uncle lodge a complaint, ...then this would be a big issue to us and to the doctor as well. We can delay the autopsy for a day. The potency of the drug in the body will be decreased slightly. Anyway it'll be known. But we can take care that the investigation doesn't reach higher level. Why is this bandage? - The police have caught them, boss. My brother and his friend had escaped by knocking the cop. The cop had chased and caught them. - Was he caught or got hit? The cop had kicked the bike. My brother skid off the bike and had thirteen sutures on his head. Who is the cop? - N4 station Inspector Rudhran, boss. - Rudhran? - Yes, boss. Rudhran! Rudhran was totally trapped! Ravi, wonder you're a politician. Always wearing white attires. Don't you understand, Ravi? You're asking for way to go to Tirunelveli. But you aren't aware that you've sweet in your hand. - Do you want me to say it? - No, boss. You no need to say anything. I'll lodge a complaint in DC office and will give an interview. Take care of the news issue. - Good, that's it. What's your brother's name? - Maran. Your brother's name will be on headlines for next two days. You've escaped because of him, go... I'll take care. Thank you, boss. - Okay. Thank you, boss. Sir, a life has been lost from our side. Please don't leave him just because he belongs to your department. Anbu. - Tell me, brother. The media is waiting outside. You should speak clearly what Ravi has told. Okay, brother. You understand, right? Come. My brother had seizures this morning and died at the Government hospital. This cop had some rage in mind and thrashed my brother to death. Ravi, take hundred people to the Collector's office and start a protest. I'll look after it, boss. You must go immediately, Ravi. - Okay, boss. You'll get the news in an hour. Arrange a canopy for 20 by 20 feet with 40 chairs. Okay, brother. We are going immediately to the Collector's office and starting a protest. Do you understand? - Okay, brother. Go, arrange for it. Hey, brother. - Tell me, boss. "Maran murder case" This hastag should be a sensational trend all over Tamil Nadu. Okay, boss. I'll do it. Go to the Collector's office. The deceased Maran's family is doing protest there. Sit along with them and twist that the cop has chased Maran on casteism. Could you do? Is that all, boss? It can be done so easily. Is it enough if he is expelled from the job? He should not wear the uniform anymore. He should not live with dignity. Create an incident of that quality. Upload a video, go. Okay brother, I'll do. It was boss Vathapi who cooked up this as caste issue. It is true that my brother died of the chocolate I brought. I thought I won't have any problem after you were arrested. Forgive me and leave me alive, sir. I'll not sell drugs henceforth, sir. Everything you've said has been recorded. You should come to the court and tell what you've told me now. Okay, sir. If you don't tell, I'll kill you. Do you understand? Greetings, sir! Yeah, welcome. Be seated. Rudhran, how are you? Did you go and see your baby? Is everything okay? She told she will show the baby only if I'm proved innocent. Everything will be fine, don't worry. I'll make you acquittal. What else then? Unexpected twists and turns are happening in this case one after another. Without coming to mainstream politics, wonder how many things has Vathapi done... If we show the video of Anbu in court, they might turn the case against us... ...as if we got this confession intimidating him. But the event of baptism is enough. I'll panic this whole mob. This is not an ordinary case, Rudhran. It's the biggest problem prevailing in India today. A clan is going around saying the god we worship is a devil. Let us expose them to the nation. All true Christians will stand with us. What do you say, Joseph? True Christians will not do such things, sir. We too have resentments, sir. Try to get this as video source instead of a photo. I'll make all speak about it by Quash. - Okay, sir. Today is Tuesday. A special prayer meeting. The domination of the devils does not exist in any other state in India except Tamil Nadu. That too the big devils are around... Don't we have to chase those devils away? We need great strength for that. Just hundred and thousand rupees offerings aren't enough. You've to offer thousands and lakhs. What you sow, you'll reap the same quantity. If you sow more, you'll get more quantity, isn't it? So you offer generously. We will chase away the devils in Tamil Nadu with the strength of the offerings. This assembly ends today. We will meet again on Friday special worship. Praise the lord! - Praise the lord! Go safe. Praise the lord. - Praise the lord. What could I do for you? - I'm Joseph Durai. He is Rudhran, my friend. Watching videos of your blessings, he has utmost respect on you. Do you belong to...? - Yes. Good, you've brought him straight to me. Tell me, brother. Pastor, lot of good things has happened to me after watching your videos. So if you give your videos, I'll arrange to telecast your messages on my own expense. You become a member of this Church, first. Get baptized. Then I'll give my videos. Pastor, there is a small problem. - What? He is a Government servant. But he will serve us indirectly. Oh, is it so? Subramanian. - Pastor. Come here. - Tell me, pastor. He is the editor of my videos. Copy all my prayer videos to a hard disk and give him. Okay, pastor. They will see. Shall I leave? Why does pastor call you Subramanian? Didn't you change the name? I have changed it. Three years ago I was Subramanian swamy. Now I'm Subramanian Arogya swamy. What if he did not call you? I'll call you. Oh, thank you brother. Arogya swamy. - Tell me, brother. Copy the last three years activities of pastor in a hard disk. We will promote it well. All the files are in the system. You come, I'll copy it and give you. Thank you. - Come. Criminal OP number 1609/2021 Petitioner - Rudhran. I'm appearing for petitioner Rudhran, your honour. Proceed. - Thank you, your honour. When the petitioner Rudhran was an inspector in N4 police station, Stating that he had allegedly kicked and killed a person named Maran, ...with caste violence in mind, ...he was booked in cases of IPC 304A and Section 3&4 SC, ST act. My client has been in judicial custody for past six months, ...just few days ago he has been granted bail by you. At this stance, I humbly request you to watch a video we got regarding this case, your honour. I have already submitted it. Play it. By the grace of Holy Son of the Holy spirit, Let everything good happen to you. Today you've taken baptism. Let spring blossom in your life. Your honour, Maran who was involved in this murder case... ...had converted himself to Christianity and was baptized, ...that's what you've watched. People like this who convert to Christianity... ...and practically live like Hindus are called "Crypto Christians". They are not Hindus. They belong to Christianity. There are millions of people like this in India. For the death of a person who has converted to Christianity, ...the PCR act is not valid under the Constitutional law of India. So I humbly request you to dismiss the FIR registered wrongly... ...and to investigate only the IPC 304A case. Don't you know this when applying for bail? No your honour, only after he came out of bail he knew this and gave me the video evidence. I think someone is diverting this case for their selfishness, your honour. If you dismiss the PCR act on my client, many facts will be revealed to this court. So kindly accept my petition, your honour. Admitted. - Thank you, your honour. I order the Investigation officer of this case and the Public Prosecutor... ...to submit the reason for filing PCR act and their comments on this video in two days. Why have you come so far? Would've seen in the office tomorrow. Vathapi, why are you asking me as if you don't know? You're involved in Rudran's case. I have been getting more phone calls for two days. Okay, tell me what's the matter? You've filed PCR act enraged on the Inspector. But the deceased had been baptized a year ago and had not changed the certificate. Somehow he found this and submitted it in the court. As per law, the caste shouldn't be used after converting to other religion. Not only that, after accepting Christianity they come under DC section. Brother, please don't give me lecture. What should I do? What do you expect from me? Just say it. Did we catch fish in the sea by casting nets? It's the clan gathered with more difficulty by fish bait. Here caste is having deep roots than religion. Call Rudhran and talk to him. Else, it'll be a big problem to us. Take care. Instead of talking to him and getting compromised, ...let me see how to turn it to our favour. We are already facing many problems. If this is revealed, those who are funding us will kill us. Call and speak to him once without any thought. Okay, brother. I'm Vathapirajan speaking. - I know, tell me. Have to meet you. I expected this, where should I come? I'll send the location by WhatsApp. Will you come or appear on video call like last time? You should have that fear! So sweet of you my darling! I'm more interested in seeing you than you do. Thank you. Greetings, Vathapirajan. - Be seated, Rudhran. Wonder, you're giving more respect. Why did you call me, darling? You said on phone that I was scared. I'm not scared. That's just to compromise. I think you know why I've asked you to come. It's visible when looking at you. - Is it visible? I don't know how I get caught only to you doing something wrong. You're great, darling! You know exactly what to do to yield the fruit. The Crypto issue. I felt dizzy... These people were all scared. Rudhran, there is nothing wrong to admit our mistakes sometimes. I admit my mistake. I never sat down like this and apologized to anyone. The Crypto issue. It's an international lobby, Rudhran. I'll finish this case and get back your job. But this must end today. Let's finish this, sweet heart. Oh, that's so nice! If so, I can walk out free that I have nothing to do with the guy's death? Is that what you say? - Exactly, you're right Rudhran. If so, who will take the blame for the murder and go to prison? I'll take care, you don't have to worry. This system is corrupted. And moreover, these people are affected by amnesia. They yelled you that day. They will be scolding someone else today. They will believe if we say he had genetic issue, got seizures and died. That's all, I'll take care. You don't have to worry. Yes, isn't it? But what's the benefit for me? - Benefit? According to me, the only potential drug in the world is money. Ask how much you want. Earlier you've agreed to take money but didn't come. If you want add it too. Are you a middleman? No, I know many middlemen. You ask me, Rudhran. He will never change. Hey, you've to surrender stating that you're the reason for his death. Will you? What are you looking at? Wastrel. He died because of the chocolate you've imported. Are you wondering how do I knew all this? The confession of Anbu is on my phone. This case will not end without revealing the disgusting politics you do. Rudhran, you don't know about me. - What's that I haven't known? It's you who decide what should be today's headlines, where should the riots happen. You're a high class politician who sells drugs and enslaved youth making them not to think. For your damn ten principles, you've created ten leaders and controlling politics. Moreover, you decieve the youth who depends on you. To get votes in the elections you'll act as if good. Is this enough? Still you want more? You've digged a lot. You know more about me but still you left me. What do you want? I need to show the world who you're. I need to wipe away your idealogy totally. I'll do. Do you think I'm scared? I'm not scared. Do whatever you can. Get lost. So sweet, take care my darling. Why did you mess up, Vathapi? Hey! Sorry. What do you want? The media should leave this topic and speak a different one, isn't it? I'll create something else. You leave now. No Vathapi, again... Brother! I might yell at you. I'm frustrated, you better leave. Only God should save us. You've gone to meet Vathapi. What did he say? He tells to take back the Quash case. He says he will complete Maran's murder case, delete my name and get back my job. Oh, that's great! Our advocate expected this. Then what? Agree with him and take up the job.. Let's go to see the child. The lord has not forsaken us. Yes, you're right, brother. But I did not accept that. What do you say? We had filed the case for this sake, right? No, do you remember that day the doctor told to admit my nephew at Chengalpattu home? Yes. - I went to visit that place. Hey, look here... - If you come close, I'll slit my throat. No, what I say is... - No, I'll slit my throat... Parents are pitiable. - No, leave me. No, don't do... - Leave me, else I'll slit my throat. I'll do whatever you want. - No, don't come close. You shouldn't be in hurry. - Listen me, I swear I'll slit my throat. No... - Leave me, don't come close. Give it. Take him and let him be alone. Take him without hitting. Thank you very much, sir. Tell me, sir. What should I do? I want to join my nephew here. So I came to see the hostel and know the formalities. Okay, come. Why is he so arrogant? I know boys are addicted to drugs. But he went to the extent to slit his throat by himself... What's this, sir? - This is a simple case, sir. Earlier, a warden was beheaded for reprimanding a guy here. More people like this come here for treatment. This is the only home all over Tamil Nadu. When you look at the count of boys addicted to drugs till date... ... opening a centre in every district wouldn't be enough, sir. It's very difficult to save the future generation. Come, sir. These are the boys. Look them. Brother, please take me home. I'll not take drugs anymore. Hey, we will go. I'll fall at your feet, brother. Take me home.. Wait...wait... Just four days more... Take me home, brother. - We will go... What to do? It's routine everyday. Take me home. Sir, fill the form and bring your nephew. Come, sir. Until our generation, people were ruined by alcohol. People like Vathapi... ...come up with new stuff and distorting the thinking of the next generation. We need to shed light on this people and expose them to this world. Though you're suspended, you prove that you're a cop. I'll be with you until your endeavour succeeds. You go ahead, brother. Criminal OP number 1609 / 2021 I'm Surya Prakash, appointed as Special Public Prosecutor in this case, your honour. I have submitted the Church log book related to this case. In the video evidence given by Indrasena sir, a week prior or post to that date... ...the log book clearly states that no religious conversion took place, your honour. You can cross check. I object this your honour. I can prepare hundred log books like this. That is, if a person gets converted as a Christian... ...ask whether they had given the Government a proper register of date and place. If so, ask them to submit it to the court. Then I'll agree. This is the log book that was edited last night. I'll say it for sure. His argument is right, isn't it? The video clearly shows the guy being baptized. He'd have done the ritual without knowing about the procedure, isn't it? The certificate is important to the law. As there is no written evidence that Maran converted to Christianity... ... I humbly request that this petition be dismissed, your honour. Your honour, there are millions of people in India called Crypto Christians. All of them are Hindus as per certificate but Christians in practice. Once you get baptized, to be clear... The Bible says that if a person is baptized, he'd be a true Christian from that day on. According to article 26, it's their personal matter. I don't want to interfere in it. I like to ask one question. The DC who arrested my client‌, let him tell this court on what basis... ...he has arrested my client on PCR act and filed the case, then everything will be over. That's all your, honour. - Come. Isn't it you who formed a team and arrested my client Rudhran on Section 304A and PCR act? Yes, sir. On what basis did you arrest him on that day? You tell in this open court. Mam, as far as this case is concerned, Maran's brother gave me a complaint on 304 A. He started the protest on the day the complaint was lodged and he filed another complaint ... ...that Rudhra Prabhakaran had kicked Maran because of caste violence. On all the news channels, they started saying that the Inspector Rudhra Prabhakaran had kicked Maran... ...because of Ambedkar's image in his attire. Communal tension erupted across the state. After that, since the autopsy report favoured the complaint, we have arrested Inspector Rudhra Prabhakaran. Good...good...good... Your honour, just underline only one line in his statement. He says that my client kicked Maran since he had Ambedkar's image on his attire. And that's why he had arrested him. I'll ask only one question, mam. Sir Ambedkar is a common leader. He is not a leader for any particular caste. He is the leader for all the people of India. Ambedkar wrote the law of Constitution for all the people of India. He did not write only for the scheduled community. I'll say one more thing. In this open court, I'm very proud to tell I belong to scheduled community. I have a photo of Sir Muthuramalingam in my house. There is a photo of Anna, the scholar and great leader Kamarajar. So are you going to say that I do not belong to scheduled community? Seven Ambedkar statues were unveiled on the same day. But those leaders do not belong to the scheduled community. They were leaders of other associations, they belonged to other communities. If you agree with him, dismiss this case now. That's all your honour. DC sir, it's the crime of the society to push the legislator into the caste. The crime of politics. Is there any other reason to impose PCR law besides this? Tell me. I have taken this action based on the complaint I got, mam. If you inquire Maran's brother Anbu you might get more information, mam. I order the police to produce the deceased Maran's brother on 19th. I told to give this case to you so that you'll argue well against Indrasena and defeat him. But you let him to talk and had fun. Tell me if you can't, it'll be over if Rudhra Prabhakaran is killed. This is better than that. We do it if it's so easy. We are doing all this since we can't do him anything, right? Touching a cop is the same as touching electricity. The impact is for us. I never dealt any matter so patiently. He had banged me. To him... Tell me what should I do? Ask like that, I have an answer for it. They will try to close this case by the video of Anbu's confession. So make sure he doesn't come to the court. Just do this, that's enough. That's all, right? - Yes. - He will not come tomorrow. - Okay, be careful. I'm leaving. Generally everyone is reluctant to say that they belong to scheduled community. But in court you argued majestically that you belong to scheduled community. - This is what everyone is talking about. - Ambedkar is like a God to us. But all over India, they've used him as a point to do politics and made him an enemy to other communities. They made him the sole person for a particular community for their selfish politics. He should be celebrated similar to Mahatma Gandhi. Let this be a start. What else, Rudhran? Vathapi won't stay calm now. Definitely he'll do something. Let him do anything. First let's get rid of this PCR and it's my responsibility to get back your job again. Let's see in the court. Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir. Tell me, boss. I don't know what will you do. I should get the message that Anbu is dead. Okay, boss. Kill Anbu, I shouldn't see you in Tamil Nadu for next six months. Better leave from here. Actually I think of killing you too for the job you've done. But you've learnt the magic of drug trafficking. That's why you're left alive. I shouldn't see you for next six months. Get the work done and leave. Okay sir, you look after the case in the court. I'll take care. - Ask to produce Anbu, Maran's brother. - Give the report to the Judge. What's this, sir! Did he commit suicide? Yes, your honour. He died of consuming poison yesterday. They have done autopsy today. I have got the report on special permission saying the case is proceeding in the court. Objection, your honour. I suspect whether it was a suicide. Because this case will change if Anbu comes to the court and testifies. That's why they had killed him and call it suicide. It's so sad that PP is complicit in this case. PP who should stand with Government is literally helping someone. Sir, I know you'll say like this. That's why, I came along with autopsy report. No wounds on his body. The report clearly states the he died of consuming poison. Sir, I too suspect you. You may have done something to him feared that he'd tell the truth if he come to the court. Mind your words, PP. Mind your words... Do you know to whom are you talking? Sir... sir... please... Please be quiet. Indrasena sir, this is your case. You'd have brought your witness safely. Okay, is there anyone else from your side as witness? I'll summon. Yes, there is one important witness. When this incident happened, Mathi was driving and Maran was at pavilion. Mathi is alive. If he is produced in the Court, many facts will be revealed... ... provided, if he too doesn't commit suicide. DC sir! - Mam! At least bring him safe and alive to the court. Sure, mam. See the next case. Rudhran, be seated. What's the matter, sir? Tell me. Don't mistake me, can we trust Writer Joseph? Because you're involved in the religion he belongs to. Mathi must be brought to the court safely. Joseph sir is a good person. He'd never tell anyone where Mathi was staying. Tomorrow he will bring Mathi safely. In the name of Father, Son and Holy spirit, Amen. Why have you come to meet me, Vathapi sir? Nothing sweetheart, since Christmas is approaching, I came to greet and pray along with you. Boss. - What? I searched all over the house. He is not here. Then let us ask sir. Where did you keep the guy Mathi? If you say, we will wish you Merry Christmas and leave. Don't make me behave bad, please sir. Twenty seven years of police service. I'll not tell you. Great, he is having twenty seven years of service. Damn it, I thought of gifting him a gold chain. What shall we do him? What shall we do, tell me. Vathapirajan is not like you think. You must be very careful. I know, sir. I still believe the law. That's why, I'm so patient. We have recorded on body cam the boys selling drugs. We are going to submit it to the court tomorrow. If you're having 27 years of experience means, you'd have joined the job at 25 years of age. Will you be 52 years old now? Why are you adamant at this age? Tell me where that guy is, I"ll leave. My hands are hurting. Vathapi sir, I'm 52 years old, the life I lived. How can I change myself? - Oh,my god! his flashback... I'll not tell you. Hey, finish him. Give me the phone. Hey, hold him high. Sir, it's Vathapi. Switch on the speaker. Hello! - Many people are dying because of you. Do you understand? Please end your game. Otherwise you'll have to lose many people. There is no time for that. I'm very busy. I cannot hang around with you, do you understand? - Do you know where am I now? - Move. I'm talking from Joseph's house. Joseph!!! Come Rudhran. What? - Hit him. What? Have both witnesses arrived? Mathi has arrived, sir. But in last night incident, Joseph sir... What happened to Joseph? - He is in the hospital unconscious. What's this? What about the bodycam footage? That too will be known only if he comes. Shouldn't you be careful? Go and sit. Present Maran's friend Mathi. How did the Inspector treat you? How did Maran die? Say it boldly. I'll tell, sir. Inspector Rudhran arrested us not in the case of smoking in public. But for selling drugs in the market. We both have escaped on bike from there on that day. Inspector Rudhran sir has chased us on his bike. He kicked us off from his bike as we were escaping without stopping. Both of us skid from the bike and were injured severely. He himself picked us up and took us to the hospital. And he asked both of our mothers to come to the police station. Thinking our life shouldn't get ruined, he has filed a smoking case on us... ...he himself paid the fine and sent us both. This is what happened that day, mam. Whether Inspector Rudhran kicked off Maran mentioning or knowing his caste? No sir, while we were escaping on the bike, We were about to hit a pregnant woman on the road. She was scared and got down in the middle of the road. It was only when he saw that, he kicked us angrily. Was there Sir Ambedkar's photo on Maran's T-shirt? No, sir. I had never seen him wearing such a T-shirt. That's a lie. Someone has created it, mam. Then how did Maran die? How did he get the seizures? Maran's brother will supply us drugs, sir. They brought a new product where drug is mixed in the chocolate. He took four or five at once on that night. He got seizures when his mother woke him up in the morning. We immediately rushed him to the hospital. But the doctor said he was dead. Why didn't you tell this to the police then? That is... - Why didn't you tell? Ranger Ravi and Maran's brother threatened me. They said they will kill my mother and sister. I was scared and never told anyone about this, mam. That's all your honour. Joseph is another important eye witness in this case. Joseph is having recorded footage on body cam of everything he said. Feared whether he'd present it... ...he was hit to coma last night and got admitted in the hospital. If at all PP has conscience, he should accept this testimony. Thank you. Public Prosecutor, do you like to cross examine? No, your honour. You must see an important evidence. - Get it. Mathi and Inspector Rudhran belong to the same caste. Those community certificates are the proof. Although Maran is a friend, in order to save Inspector Rudhran, they've created... ...a good story and asked him to tell it. Fearing Writer Joseph would tell the truth, they did something and pushed him to coma... ...and destroyed the body cam footage he had. It's all a well planned drama, mam. So I humbly request you that this case be dismissed. That's all, your honour. - Mam, I swear it's not the fact. Myself and Maran never thought about caste. He is lying, mam. Mathi... Hey, will you say something as you wish? What do you know about our friendship? Mathi, be silent. You shouldn't talk unruly in the Court. You'll be punished unnecessarily. Indrasena sir, do you've any other solid evidence? If so, present it in the next hearing. That will be the final hearing of this matter. This court is adjourned. - What sir? - Tell me, sir. Looks like you won't let the people to stay friendly. Seems you will survive only if you mess up with caste. I too don't agree with this. But Vathapi is not an ordinary man. Finish him off. This case will end. Better concentrate on it, sir. Rudhran, see what is he saying. In mythology, Vathapi a demon was killed by Rudhran. I hope you understand what I said. Hello! Sir, I'm retired SI Sundarapandian speaking. You've rescued my daughter. - What's the matter, tell me? Now I'm working as security officer in a company at ennore. A big godown is nearby. Vathapi's men come here, put holes on the sealed containers and trafficking drugs. I thought of telling you. - Where should I come? - Metal box godown, sir. How long will you be doing it? Hey, it's been twenty minutes. Change it soon. If it doesn't reach harbour in an hour, it'll be a problem. If boss knew, he will kill us. Get the job done quickly. Just five minutes, it's over. - Finish it fast. - It's over. Okay, brother. Hey, take the phone. Hey, where are you all? Hey, are you playing hide and seek? Rudhra Prabhakaran. Is this all your job? I came for a compromise but you didn't listen. That's why, I revenged you in the court. I agree, you're steeped into politics. I thought I had to do something legally. But I can't. So... - That means? Have you decided to kill me? Is that so? I didn't bid bye to my family. It seems you've left the house bidding bye. Hey, come on. I was just looking after my work. You made everyone talk about me as caste fanatic. Why is this disgusting politics? Leave us all to live untidily. "Rudra's dance" "Rudra's dance" Indhrasena sir, this is the last hearing of this case. Present now if you've any solid evidence? Thank you, your honour. Your honor, Mr.Joseph is the important evidence of this case. Now he is in the hospital lying unconscious. But the real proof can be submitted only if I get the bodycam footage from him. But I have a confession of Anbu who is dead. I have submitted it to the court. Please look at it, mam. Please. I thought he'd come to the court and say this. Unfortunately he committed suicide. The influence of an individual Vathapirajan is present everywhere in this case. If you want to understand the truth, give me time until Joseph becomes conscious. That's all, your honor. Greetings, mam! I'm Maran's mother. I want to tell you few things related to this case. Come here and tell. Thank you, mam You should watch this video, please. Get that. Public Prosecutor, watch this video. - Do you've any doubts about this? - No, mam. There is no image of sir Ambedkar or any other political leader on Maran's attire. I feel sorry, mam. How did you get this video? When my son got hurt, a person from my locality shot this. Do you've any doubt on Inspector Rudhra Prabhakaran? No, mam. As my son's life shouldn't be ruined, he filed a small case on him... ...and even he himself paid the fine. Even my son Maran didn't utter anything wrong about him, mam. That's the fate of my son! Drug addiction has taken my son's life, mam. Okay, do you want to say anything else? I want to tell you some facts about this case. Tell me. I have killed three people who were the reason for my son's death. - What are you saying? - Yes, mam. The main reason for my son's death was my elder one Anbu. He didn't commit suicide. It's me who poisoned him with food. The second person who I killed was my boss, Ranger Ravi. Everyone is thinking that he has gone out of station. His corpse is still there in salt water at that ice- factory. - Hey, take care. - Sir... The third one who I killed was Vathapirajan. I have blazed him along with the stuff in his godown. How did you know that all these people were involved in this case? Inspector Rudhran has shot a video asking my son to tell all the facts that happened. My son was telling Ranger Ravi about that video. They didn't notice I was there. Only then I was aware of all the facts. Whoever responsible for my son's death... I have killed them, mam. I have killed them. But, I couldn't do anything about the addiction... ...I could do anything, mam. A very important question about this case. Is it true or not that your son Maran has converted to other religion? My son has converted, mam. My son Anbu did this after listening to some politicians. He also invited me to take baptism. My thought is, we have to die how we were born. So, I refused. But it's true that both my sons were converted. This is indeed a very sensitive case. The Prevention of Violence act is very easily misused. If converted to Christianity, the Hindu caste shouldn't be used, it has been violated despite it's referred in the law. Not only that, this case shows that drug addiction is ubiquitous. In view of this three factors, this Court advises the Government of India and Tamil Nadu... ...to stricten certain legal procedures. Due to the political greed of an individual Vathapi... ...an honest police officer who haven't done any mistake was revenged by the Prevention of violence act. The misuse of this law enacted for the protection of the scheduled community is highly rephrensible. And can cause violence between communities. Ordering to the extend that this law can no longer be misused... The court recommends the Government of India to set up a committee. This court declares the Police Inspector Rudhra Prabhakaran as innocent. Also, accepting Maran's mother Annalakshmi's confession... ...this court orders to remand her in custody for 15 days. This court is adjourned. - Sir, just two minutes. - Yes, go. Greetings, sir! You made a mistake. I was the one who killed Vathapi. It's wrong that you accepted that blame. Only the faulty should be punished. - Why should you? - No, sir. I can tell as many lies as possible to save a good person like you. Come here, dear. Sir, no one should die of addiction like Maran anymore. We need officers like you, sir. Give me the child, dear.
