- Long ago the ancient Greeks told the tale of Lycian and of Arcadia, a cruel King and father of many children. A man with no time for authority figures and contempt for the Gods. So it was that one night, in order to test the omnipotence of the great Zeus he invited him to dinner and served him a meal he would never forget, the boiled flesh of his youngest son, Niktamus. But Zeus of course was all knowing, and straight away restored the dead child's life, and in his rage Zeus cursed Lycian, damning him to wander the Earth as a savage beast, the Lycan, a wolf. - The Beast of Bray Road was not even my first book. I had one that I'd been researching for six years about a true crime poison murder in Walworth county that happened in the 1920's and I really wanted to get that story out too, so I wrote that one first, that was my second book, the Beast of Bray Road, tailing Wisconsin's werewolf, and that really, again I thought it would settle things kind of once and for all and it just brought the whole thing to life again. Elkhorn is a very pretty nice, little town right in the center of Walworth county, it's where the court house and everything is, it has a beautiful town square that was the subject of some famous Christmas cards years ago. It's just a very nice conservative little town, it's just a great place to raise my family, and it doesn't look like a place that would harbor a werewolf. - Situated in Walworth County, the city of Elkhorn is comprised of nearly eight square miles of land and has a population of just over 10,000 people. It was founded in the early 1800's and acts as the county seat, due in part to it's location at the geographic center of the county. Elkhorn has become a thriving little town thanks to its proximity to the nearby tourist destinations of Lake Geneva and Delavan Lake, both home to resorts and considered popular vacation get aways. Nevertheless the area also has its share of local legends and lore. - I'd never considered that it was particularly weird but when you start looking at all the variety of terrain, we have hauntings everywhere, everything about the state is what you don't picture when you initially here the term Wisconsin. Also, a very long time and special Native American presence that isn't necessarily just weird, you know it just makes Wisconsin a very different sort of place and maybe sets the stage for some of the other things that come later that are weird. - The state is actually one of the hottest states of paranormal activity, number one. I don't know if it's the Native American's, the history there, but there's also a lot of UFO sightings, just in our state that I've even seen just down here in South East Wisconsin, as well as a lot of other crazy things, so I definitely think it is something special. Wisconsin welcomes you. - Elkhorn got it's name because someone saw an elk horn hanging in a tree, but it wasn't from around here, there weren't elk in this area. So the theory is that someone coming back from the west had an elk horn and threw it up in the tree. I guess that's the rumor I've heard anyway. - In her books Linda Godfrey has detailed a number of Wisconsin's more infamous tall tales, from hair covered forest elves that roam the northern regions, to mysterious aberrations that haunt it's numerous abandoned buildings. An aquatic monster is said to lurk in the depths of Lake Winnebago, while hitch hiking phantoms have been seen by a number of unsuspecting motorists traveling Highway 12 late at night. Amongst all the legends and fables that make up the folk law of the badger state, you'll also find records of encounters with ape like creatures that date back to the mid 1800's, particularly in the wooded sections of a state, mostly known for it's prairies. It's also been home to a handful of cults, most often near the city of Milwaukee which lies 46 miles north east of Elkhorn. Strangely the state of Wisconsin has also found itself embroiled in Satanic and ritualistic activity over the years, as recently as 2011 it made national headlines when two women attempted to murder a man they'd lured to their Milwaukee apartment. They stabbed him over 300 times in what the victim claimed was a Satanic ritual. Then there's the infamous Slender Man stabbing which took place in waukesha, some thirty miles north of Elkhorn. In this case two 12 year old girls assaulted and nearly killed one of their peers while trying to appease what is essentially a fictional internet character. Perhaps Elkhorn with its old fashioned city square and numerous churches has avoided that aspect of the states tragic side. - People of Elkhorn run a wide gammit, we have farmers, a very strong group of merchants, because the court house is there we have a lot of lawyers in the town. So it's a great mix of people, and again, it doesn't fit that stereotype, I'm sure there's one guy walking around the square eating the cheese you know, but generally it's just nice small town folks. - Just down Geneva Street through downtown Elkhorn beyond the Highway 12 overpass lies an unassuming stretch of blacktop called Bray Road. Bordered by farmland and the occasional stands of trees the road runs nearly perpendicular to Highway 12 to the south west and parallel to Highway 43 which lies just to it's north. Until the 1960's, when the highways were built Bray Road was rarely traveled by outsiders and we essentially a driveway for those that lived along its rough unpainted path. - The Bray family started moving here in the late 1890's and at one time there were four brothers that all lived down here. My great grandfather bought our farm in 1902 and I believe he was the last one of the brothers to move in this area. - It's interesting, Bray Road is nothing scary looking, it's like going down any farming road or rural road. Because it's farmers it's all fifth generation farmers, they all know each other, it's very privately owned, you can't just stop off on the road and look around because you know one farmer's gonna notify the other one, hey somebody's on your land. - I had discovered already by some overlooked books that I found in the library that Bray Road at one time was a Native American trail that lead out to some other area of lakes that would have been summer places. - Just the way the road kind of winds around down through here, it was probably some sort of a trading trail at one time. Out in the middle of one of the fields, there was a remnants of an old homestead and shack out there that had been used for trading with the Indians. - Bray Road is just over four miles long, within that stretch a handful of country roads cross it's path, such as Brookwood Lane, Plank Road, and Hospital Road. Coming from Elkhorn Bray dead ends into Interstate 11. Acres of cornfields and patchy woods are intermingled with farms, residential houses and swampy marshlands. In the last 20 years the only thing that's changed are the number of people that visit the road hoping to catch sight of a creature that put Elkhorn on the world map nearly three decades ago. - It was December of 1991, and I'd been working for a short time as a newspaper reporter at a small countywide newspaper in Walworth County, Wisconsin. And it came to my attention that there were people around my own home town of Elkhorn that were saying they had seen what looked to them, like a werewolf along this four mile stretch of road outside of Elkhorn. And I remember laughing because it just seemed so ludicrous to me, and I mentioned it to our county animal control officer. - My name is John Frederickson, I believe it was back in 1986, that's when I first became involved with the whole animal welfare, I was appointed the Walworth County humane officer at that time. Primarily to investigate crimes against animals and enforce state statutes and county ordinance. - And I said, have you heard what people are saying about there being this big canine type thing, they're calling it a werewolf out on Bray Road? - There was kind of a freelance reporter, Linda Kelp. The one freelance reporter had found out what Lori Endrezzi had seen, and from there I believe it went to Linda Godfrey. And I believe at that time I had invited Lori Endrezzi in to talk to her about her sightings, and at that time I made a manila folder marked werewolf and that's kind of where the whole werewolf folder comes in there. - And he opened up his desk drawer, pulled out a manila file folder that was marker werewolf, or labeled werewolf and at that moment is when it became news really because when you've got a county official with a file folder marked werewolf that's news. - There was the one sighting, when somebody was traveling down I43 right by Delavan here and they got off at the Delavan exit and some large creature ran right in front of their car. And then there were the so called sightings on Bray Road. - He showed me the contents, it was notes he'd written from people who were indeed phoning him and saying I don't know what it was, I saw this thing, if I had to say it looked like a werewolf because it had the head of a wolf or German Shepherd, it was huge, it stood and ran on it's hind legs. - And I believe there was a story, a mother walking down the road with her child or children. Up ahead the road a deer came running across the road then behind it some creature on two legs was chasing the deer. Nothing too elaborate, nothing that could be confirmed obviously. - I began to call upon these people and when I went to interview them in person I discovered I did not think that they were crazy or trying to hoax something. They came from a very wide demographic, they were older, younger, male, female, blue collar, white collar. So it was a diverse group, I thought well, there's something, they're seeing something. I didn't know what it was. - A typical report is a biped walking humanoid dog with the muzzle, with the ears, about seven to eight feet tall, hairy, hands like, I don't want to say like a human, but humanoid hands with claws. - It had the head of a wolf or German shepherd, it was huge, it stood and ran on it's hind legs. - They said fangs and the red eyes, the pointy ears, almost like a German shepherd, but it's standing up on two legs, and it's ginormous, it's taller than any person. - Covered with fur, long snout, and it's legs were bent backwards like a dogs. - And just ferocious looking, something that people say is a complete nightmare to see. - One thing I've noticed is that the closer in time it is between the sighting and their reporting it to me the more I still see that fear response and I will actually sometimes just see people reliving the fear, they turn white, they turn red, they start sweating. I've had one woman even burst into tears while she's telling me because they still feel this sort of visceral contact with this creature. - On Halloween night 1991 Doris Gibson had what would become known as the first publicly recorded sighting of the Beast of Bray Road. Her experience would launch a rash of reported sightings around Walworth County. - She was a senior in high school at the time and was driving down Bray Road, she felt like this muffled thump, and she was afraid that she'd hit somebody's dog, or ran over an animal or something. She said I saw this thing, I don't know what it was but it was big, and it started running for me. She said I could hear it's feet on the asphalt boom, boom, it actually lunged for her car and scraped its claws on the trunk of the car. And she showed this to me, I remember examining it and they were consistent with two sets of claws clawing their way down the back of the car, and that was one of the things that scared her so badly. - Shortly after Gibson's sighting a Milwaukee teen Tom Brichta would have his own encounter with the Beast of Bray Road. - My name is Tom Brichta, I live in Tremaine, Oklahoma on highway C, it was a Saturday night, late July, early August and I was coming home from a wedding reception, I had my friend Scott and my friend Chris from Hanover Park Illinois in the car with me, it was very foggy, we could barely see two car lengths ahead of you. And we started smelling this funny odor, this real foul smelling odor like this skunky kind of smell. I had noticed a hand sticking out into the road, and my friend had noticed me looking out on the side of the road, and he had looked and he had seen whatever it was, it was huge, it was really large, it was whitish, gray and black, streaks in it. It was hairy, it was reaching out towards my car, it scratched a small piece of pin striping from my car. The fingers were either pointed or had quite the nails on them, I did not get any facial detail but it was frightening, it was very frightening. And now as long as I think about this, not a day goes by that I don't, and I know a day won't go by that I won't think about it. I can remember like it was just yesterday. - Another one was Lori Endrezzi, at the time she was a young single mother and she was a bar manager in town, and was driving home from work. She suddenly, her attention was drawn to something in the ditch. - From what she had said something was kneeling down, crouched over on the side of the road, eating, some type of roadkill. - She said it was actually kneeling in a way that she didn't think a canine could kneel. And the other weird thing is that it was holding some type of road kill animal. It frightened her very, very deeply, and she said that she spent a lot of time at the library looking for what it might have been, and it didn't match any natural wolf pictures she had seen. Now she actually, she was one of the ones that had called John Frederickson, and she went to his office to talk to him about it. - We were discussing different things that it may have been. It was something of the natural order of nature, such as some type of animal, being a coyote or wolf, and there happened random wolf sightings around that time. If it wasn't something along the natural order of nature then possibly could have been something along the supernatural realm of things. - He had a row of books on the shelf behind him at his desk, and when they started talking about this, the books started flying off the shelf. - Not too long into the conversation some books that were up on a bookshelf just came flying down, and there really wasn't any cause for the books to go flying off the shelf. So that was the end of that conversation. - It was just a one off story as far as I knew, I did this quick drawing because I was also the illustrator and cartoonist for the newspaper, and it ran, and that was when it all began. Within days and even weeks people were contacting the newspaper office, but the media were starting to catch on to it, it was just astounding. Nobody expected that sort of reaction to it. - It was a pretty good joke up and down the road. - My family actually struggled with it a little bit because this kind of popped up right after my Father had died. So my mom was just getting used to living on the farm, in the house, by herself, and all these lights were flashing around the buildings, and people walking up and down the road. So we went from kind of amusement to kind of upset, to well okay it's just a deal, just kind of had fun with it after a while. - I remember my editor and I had talked about it and said yeah local people will have fun with it for a couple of weeks and then it will just go away. And nothing could have been further from the truth. It had legs, no pun intended. The story just stuck and grew bigger and bigger. - Yeah, I believe when the paper came out and the story came out, that's when I think the more, I don't want to say the panic, but the fear set in. - The people that had actual sightings obviously, I believe a lot of those people did have an actual fear of what they had seen. Not knowing quite how to rationalize it. - Of course there was a lot of ribbing, and teasing of people who said they had seen it. The local sheriffs department's talking about silver bullets and whatnot, and that they were making silver bullets in case they ran across the beast, or whatever. - Some of the witnesses, because they later came forward with their actual identity said they wish they hadn't come forward with it. But on the other hand there were other people who had secretly seen it, and were then saying, yeah it's right, it is there I've seen it. - On December 29th, 1991, Godfrey's article detailing the initial sightings of the Beast of Bray Road ran in The Week a Delavan newspaper. Almost immediately the story kicked up a flurry of activity around the area. Perhaps most notably were a string of calls and letters to the newspaper from witnesses who had seen similar creatures. Many of the witnesses were from other towns, counties and even states who wished to express to Godfrey the seriousness in which the story should be handled. The first inkling of the larger scope of this phenomenon was beginning to take shape in Linda's mind, even as the story of the Bray Road Beast began to take on a life of it's own. In September of 1991, Scott Bray, a local farmer, had a sighting of what he referred to as an abnormally large dog or wolf in the field behind his house. Scott described the animal as taller than a German shepherd with pointed ears, a tail, long gray and black hair, and a massive muscular build. Around the same time as the Scott Bray sighting, another Elkhorn local named Russell Guest, spotted a creature near Bray Road, walking briefly on two legs before dropping to all fours in an aggressive stance. Guest turned and ran from the creature which he described as being larger than a german shepherd with black and grayish hair and around five feet tall when it was standing on two legs. On January 8th 1991, Robert Bushman and his wife spotted a large black animal running on all fours, chasing a deer just down the road from Elkhorn. The couple were driving on I43 near Delavan in broad daylight when the sighting occurred. They described the animal as being far too large to be a wolf but were unable to give a thorough description due to the speed which it was running. As sightings continued Godfrey received other reports from witnesses who claimed to have seen the same creature decades earlier. Strangely the oldest reported sighting was also the first to hint at a more sinister origin for the Beast of Bray Road. - One of the most surprising and interesting accounts that I received happened right after the first stories broke, this happened not in Walworth County but in the adjacent Jefferson County, which isn't all that far away. A newspaper editor called me and said, my dad saw this thing in 1936, and his father was the nightwatchman for St Coletta institute, which was a Catholic institution for taking care of people with special needs. They had preserved on the grounds a number of ancient burial mounds, Mark Shackleman was the name of the mans father and his job every night was to walk the whole grounds with this big flashlight, and this one night he walked up on an area where there were several mounds, and saw something large on top of one of the mounds. When he went and looked more closely he saw that it was something that reminded him of a canine head but it was a really large creature, and it was digging furiously in the top of the mound as if it was trying to get something out that it knew was in there. He was shocked, the creature was shocked and ran off but the next night he went back and the creature was there again. It stood up, faced him, and made what sounded like, he described as sort of a protohuman language, and what it sounded like to the man was the utterance of the word Gadara. Which if you go to the New Testament in the Christian Bible you'll find that's the place where there was a man who was filled with Demons, and he was called the Gadarine because it was in the region of Gadara, and that was where Jesus cast the Demons out of this man. And it's interesting because I found out later that one of the priests to the Catholic church that was kind of attached to the St Coletta organization had very bad problems after he exorcized a demon from a young person who lived in that Parrish, and then the Demon attached itself to him. So you have this whole sort of tradition of Demonology possession going on, and then you get this unknown creature standing up on an old burial mound, and uttering a word that could have been the Biblical word Gadara, and it's just very, very strange happenings. - While Mark Shacklemans 1930's encounter with a similarly strange beast may have aroused some suspicions of a more unearthly genesis for the phenomenon, it was Lori Endrezzi, the first witness of the Beast of Bray Road in the modern era who drew a parallel between the creature she had seen and an ancient evil. In an interview with Endrezzi a few years after her sighting she professed her belief to Godfrey that the Beast of Bray Road was Satanic in origin. A Demonic entity, perhaps, the Dark Prince himself. The correlation between the canid creature and the black arts may seem ludicrous to some. It was not as unbelievable to some investigators and it wouldn't be the last time that a witness felt instead of an undiscovered animal, they had come face to face with evil incarnate. - In my opinion there is a dark side to this world. So with some of these sightings they're part of the natural order of nature, and it was some animal, some type of animal, that's easily believable. Or I wouldn't doubt if it could have been something along the supernatural realm of things also from what I had experienced during those days. - With the Beast of Bray Road making it's presence known around the area local media were tied up in a story that went back even further then the first known sightings. That of a local Satanic cult, rumored to be holding meetings in the forested areas of Walworth County. During the late 80s and early 90s John Frederickson was called to the scene of multiple animal mutilations including one in which dozens of mutilated bodies had been discovered. While local police insisted the site was nothing more then a bone yard for local livestock Frederickson recognized the potential for more ritualistic causes of death, when he discovered many of the carcasses had been subject to gruesome treatment that involved the removal of organs. However, the local police bulldozed the location before a thorough investigation could be completed. Many ritualistic beliefs revolve around the notion of conjuring an entity, occasionally a Demon for nefarious purposes, as John Frederickson discovered, the link between the Beast of Bray Road and Satanism might not be as far removed as it may at first appeared. In the early 1990's John received a phone call from an anonymous source who stated that she was aware of illicit, cult like gatherings taking place in the area. - At that time there was actually quite a bit of Satanic information that was coming in. Some of it was obviously teenager type involvement, their dabbling into Devil worship, and there were a couple other places that were a little more intense, with an older crowd, adult crowd, that took the whole role of Satanic religion serious and whatnot. Anything from teachers to possible law enforcement people being involved. Yeah I guess some of their get togethers at this one location were quite involved. People from around the world actually would show up and they would go back into the woods and have their little ritualistic ceremonies and whatnot. Walworth County I had found out from a higher law enforcement department who one day just showing up out of nowhere, and introduced himself to me. Filled me in on some of the Satanic activity happening around the entire state, and I think there was three of four counties that were notorious for occult activity, Satanic activity. And I was somewhat surprised that Walworth County just happened to be one of those. - The wolf is seen as the symbol of greed and consumption, and probably because it has such a violent nature it's seen as this chaotic force in society that kinds of threatens stability in the culture. And this is often done through the abuse of science or the abuse of magic or technology. And it creates what's called the abhuman, which is not human and it's basically an individual that has lost the ability to control themselves and their desires, and in some cases they can't control whether they change into this creature or not. - I wouldn't discount, again from my experiences, and seeing what I've seen and what not. I wouldn't totally rule out some type of occult activity if by chance somebody invoked some type of a occult type beast. - Throughout history we find many legends and lore pertaining to canid creatures. In Egyptian hieroglyphics we learn of Anubis, God of the dead, a jackal headed creature who decided which souls should pass on to the afterlife. In the Bible's old testament, a king by the name of Neberkenezer was exiled from his kingdom and forced to wander the forest and fields as a wild beast, cursed to live like a wolf. Norse mythology has it's own representation of the werewolf in the form of the ancient saga of the Volsungs, which tells the story of a father and son who discovered pelts which gave the wearer the power to become a wolf for 10 days. Donning the pelts the duo turned into blood thirsty savage creatures and went on a killing rampage. Engulfed in blood lust the father eventually attacked his own son pointing to something which has since become a vital part of werewolf tales, the loss of control. Across the world the werewolf has found a home in nearly every culture. - In the epic of Gilgamesh, which is written about 2000BC you had this interesting character called Incadu, which is sort of a wild man, he's covered in hair, he's got long hair, and he lives with the animals. He ends up battling Gilgamesh, who's the hero of the story and they're equal strength wise. But Gilgamesh wins because, arguably because he's educated and part of civilization. Incadu becomes Gilgamesh's servant and there's this sort of running theme throughout Western literature of that sort of animal nature needing to be sublimated. - In the very beginning when I wrote the story about it I was just sort of thinking what would I call this. It was a thing that was very hard to name. I didn't want to call it the werewolf because right away I didn't believe it was a werewolf, so I titled it the Beast of Bray Road and it just stuck. But it doesn't mean, I know now, that there's only one thing out on one road. The descriptions people gave of the Michigan dog man were no different then the descriptions people gave of the Beast of Bray Road. - I believe that the werewolf lore had to have, it started somewhere, and every lore or myth has some truth to it, so I do believe that anything in the United Kingdom, I think we're seeing the same thing, personally. - Well anybody who studied the Middle Ages in Europe knows that there were alleged werewolves. There are other accounts of so called werewolves in those same middle ages that were considered occult and tied to witchcraft. If you admitted you were a werewolf, or somebody could prove that you were a werewolf, you were dead meat, you would be executed in most cases for the years that these trials were going on at their greatest height. - In Germany for instance, in 1589, you got what's called the werewolf of Bedburg, and a guy named Peter Stubb evidently had fangs, and claimed to have a desire for human blood. Claimed to have murdered some 16 people, he was put on trial and found to be guilty. - There was the Beast of Gevaudan, probably the most famous and in that case it's very different from these Bray Road sightings because the Bray Road beast would duck and run for cover after it had been seen by people. But back in the Middle Ages, this thing, was killing dozens and dozens of people and livestock. It was some real animal, real killer. - This is in Southern France, between June 1764 and June 1767, there are reports of this giant wolf over 200 attacks, some half of which were lethal. The victims tended to be disemboweled, clothes were taken off, and throats cut and beheaded. The death of the creature finally came in June 1767, Jean Duhamel famously shot it with bullets that were supposedly made from a silver chalice that had been blessed by a priest. So that's sort of where the idea of the silver bullet killing the werewolf comes from. - So it seems to me like a very different phenomenon that was happening back then, where you have lots of predation of both livestock and human beings, and animals that were able to be shot and captured and exhibited. - In America Native Indian lore involving wolves and man wolves has been ignored by many paranormal researchers. The Mohawk Indians believe that some of the tribe could shift form into other creatures. They referred to them as the Limakin, in the Western United States, perhaps it is the Navajo who are best known for their legends of shape-shifting men known as skin-walkers. - Especially the Navajo where you had this evil witch that's able to change into a wolf, or some other type of animal. And typically they acquire this capability by committing some type of taboo like using magic to curse someone instead of healing someone. So they sort of contrast with the healer or the medicine man so as a result they're sort of a paria to that culture. - Wisconsin had a great number of different Native American tribes living here. When I asked them what they thought the true nature of these upright canines were, they said well, we believe that these are not normal, usual modern animals. That they're very old, that they were here before we were, and that that came from the spirit world. - All of these stories tend to focus on mankind's either abusing technology, or going to a place where he should not in the first place, or investigating beyond where he should be. Typically this awakes the monster, or brings the monster about, or changes the human being into a monster. We have this facade of being civilized and cordial to one another, but there's always that sort of that inner animal that can surface at any point. And monsters sort of allow us to experience that without it actually happening. - As time passed the local reaction had exceeded Linda Godfrey's expectations, placing her at the center of a werewolf whirlwind. Reporters from no less than four Milwaukee based television stations appeared in Elkhorn, looking for Godfrey, as well as any eye witnesses that would go on record and of course the Bray Road Beast itself. Radio and wire services carried the terrifying tales beyond the Wisconsin border and in no time a modern legend roared to life. Curiosity seekers arrived in Lafayette Township for the express purpose of driving up and down Bray Road in hopes of seeing a hairy monster. Nationally televised programs such as Sightings and Inside Edition devoted segments of their shows to the Walworth County werewolf, thrusting the story into even greater prominence. Linda Godfrey's files began to swell with sighting reports and she found herself becoming the unlikely spokesperson for a phenomenon that defied reason. And then after the major waves of publicity had crested and the attention given to Elkhorn began to recede life along Bray Road slowly regained it's quiet composure. Godfrey however, remained busy, the sheer volume of reports, the veracity of the eyewitnesses and the persistence since that something significant had occurred, inspired her to write about the entire experience. In 2003, she released the Beast of Bray Road, a book that traced the history of her involvement in the breaking story, detailed the most compelling sightings, and speculated about the true nature of the dog man, in the wake of the books release there was a resurgence in sightings of bipedal wolf like creatures in the vicinity of Elkhorn and Bray Road. Almost all of these encounters took place as people were driving at night. Sometimes the canid was seen streaking through the cornfields. Other times across the road in front of the startled motorist, often giving it's distinctive sneer that terrorizes those unfortunate enough to see it. In one unforgettable case, a creature, described as larger than an Irish wolf hound kept pace with a car for well over a mile. The vehicle was traveling at a speed of 55 miles per hour. While the Beast of Bray Road and Godfrey's subsequent writing opened a door for many witnesses to discuss their confrontations, often for the first time. Still others could not being themselves to talk about what they had seen. Either they did not want to accept that such a thing could really exist, or they were even more fearful of being ridiculed. - The thing is a lot of people stopped going public with their sightings because they saw how the first ones were made fun of, and they didn't want to lose their jobs or be made fun of themselves. - As soon as there came out the Elkhorn in the paper it went national, now all of a sudden everybody's looking for this. So did it die down from the early 90s till now? I don't think so, I just think that there are a lot of people that aren't coming forward saying they saw something in fear of ridicule. - I'm sure it'd be natural for somebody to have the wits scared out of them, maybe just tell some close friends but not want it to go public or anything like that. No doubt. - As the mystery of what was being seen in Elkhorn began to spread to the rest of the country theories as to what could explain the existence of such a creature began to formulate. While there was a precedence in the form of myths and legends relating to upright wolf like beings around the world no one had postulated on the existence of such a being within the natural realm. Until Linda Godfrey's own investigations lead her to do just that. - One thing that I was always trying to work with were the commonalities in the descriptions from people and I realized that almost everybody was describing basically the same thing. Which was something that stood five to seven feet tall, had that head like a wolf or German shepherd, I called it the indigenous dog man because I was reasoning it could have been something that was just a very minor mutation of slightly larger paws and maybe some sort of adjustment in the spinal column. That perhaps it was advantageous for it to be able to stand up. If it's advantageous, and then more of these reproduce, you know, it's the natural law of adaptation, that more of them would persist in these grassland areas. - In the snow we came across this wolf print that was bigger then my hand, and there were several of them, and it is, it's frightening to see something that giant out there. - They're generally seen running on all fours but people recognize them as something different because they'll say they were as big as a pony, a Shetland pony, or a calf. - Residents up here, they know what wolves look like, dogs look like, coyotes look like. - Ricky Sanchez has a vested interest in getting to the bottom of the dog man enigma. That's because a pack of these creatures apparently frequents his acreage near the Horicon Marsh located approximately 100 miles north of Bray Road. - 2017 is when it all started at my property. It all started one night around one of the o'clock. I walked outside with a head lamp, we don't have, like we're out in the country, so there's no lights out, and I saw this large black object in the property but beside the silhouette which really could focus with the headlamps were the two eyes. Didn't really pay much attention to it because it was really low to the ground, so I kept walking towards the car. As I got to the trunk of the car I glanced at again, and it was slowly walking crouched down to the ground but towards me. So I'm trying to figure out what is this? So I walked towards it a little bit, and it walked backwards while still looking at me. That sparked my curiosity because it was coming towards me, the cat normally doesn't come towards me, I put the headlamp on brighter and kind of walked towards it, and it tried to back in the same position. So I walked towards it more and it kept on walking backwards and backwards while still looking at me, and still looking at me walked back until it reached one of the trees on the property. Flipped up, looked at me, now it's eyes shine at my height and it just stood and stared at me. I'm still trying to figure out what the hell because now it's higher up, so my headlamp can't really focus on what it is. Brought the water in, brought the dogs inside, by the time I went back out it was gone. - For the next few weeks repeated activity would occur on Ricky's property, including multiple sightings of strange shapes moving through the fields and forests surrounding his house. On more then one occasion he saw not one, but multiple pairs of strange glowing eyes peering at him from the darkness. As Ricky began to search for answers as to what was prowling on his farm he began to investigate other sightings of upright canids in the surrounding area. Soon the activity would extend to his neighbors homes including the house located closest to his. - So according to my neighbor, which is my nextdoor neighbor he gets up to work at two o'clock in the morning. He puts his trash in the back of his pickup truck, and drives out to the front of the road, picks up his trash, goes to the corner, puts it down. But he's hearing something from the truck, as he turns around to go back towards his truck he sees this dog like, wolf like creature in front of his pickup truck pacing back and forth, looking at him. He froze, it was in a kind of crouched down position but not completely on fours, looking at him as it paced back and forth. He got into his truck and went to work after he got his composure back because he didn't know what it was. Probably a week after, this was mostly every week, we were outside with a bonfire me and my neighbor, and my dad, my dad comes home from Springfield, Mass for vacation. My dad had gone inside, so it was one of those days we decided to just call it quits because there were too many mosquitoes and go inside. When we threw water on the fire it was looking at us from the other side of our field of our property. His eye shine was probably at my height, but you could see a silhouette, it wasn't on all fours, it wasn't starting erectile, it looked like it was scared. It looked terrified, it ran. While it was on the grass it ran on two legs. When we got to the trail, it's already overgrown, so you can't see through the treeline, it's already June. So you know, you have bushes and everything, you can't see, so I got kind of iffy, I told him let's head back because if this guy is either side we don't have a lot of space between us to react. So by then I told my neighbor I think it's time for us to go inside. - Many people will tell me that they felt it was giving them a message, and the messages vary from, I could jump on your car and get you if I wanted too, or if you tell anyone about me I'll come and find you, or I'm better than you are, you puny little human. That sort of thing. - I believe it's something new to the environment. Why it sometimes preferred when it was first seen to first scavenge instead of hunting. It has not breed to a specific look, you have so much variations to it. Paranormal no, like I said, it eats, it drinks, it breaths. Can it do certain things that we might not think is possible? Yes, but other things that people think that is paranormal, for me at least, I have been able to scientifically figure out. - I've always done field work, you know gone out followed tracks, looked for signs, things like that. But I had the best opportunity ever several years ago when I was contacted by a gentleman who bought a 40 some acre hay field, part of an old farm, that was adjacent to Bray Road. He was a retired math and physics teacher from Illinois. - I bought the property in 2007, my farm is in between Bowers and Bray. I was new in the area so I had not talked with many people. I cut hay, and it was ready to be bailed on a Sunday in September 2013. So I basically went down the road to a couple of local farmers, and I said I need help getting hay up, will you guys come and help, and they said, sure we'll come and help. So they did. And after we got done, the one guys said, he said well you know the Beast of Bray Road lives back on your property there. He said, oh yeah, he said, my wife saw it, and another farmer saw it, and then he's telling me another farmer saw it. The one farmer who had seen it on Bray Road, eating a raccoon. And I go okay, sure, you know, so forth. So a couple days later I was driving down Bowers Road and there was a raccoon so I took it and threw it outback on my property line, and go back two days later, and here the raccoon is cut open, and the intestines are gone. - He found a raccoon that was lying there looking like something had zipped it, from under it's chin down to the length of its abdomen, and taken the insides out in one neat scoop, set them next to the creature. - So then I, couple days later, I got a badger, it was dead on the road, roadkill, put it down in the hole, three days later it's out of the hole like 10-15 feet away, and a badger weighs 20-25 pounds. So I know a birds not picking this thing up, and there's no path, the grass is all still around this. So what I do is reach down and take it out. I said so alright some guys coming back on my property and doing this, that's crazy. So then I started setting up cameras. - As Lee's curiosity about the happenings on his property began to grow, the strangeness of what he was dealing with followed suit. Over the next four years he would document the disappearance and dismemberment of dozens of mutilated animal corpses that defied the rules of nature. While the trail cameras he set out were meant to capture evidence on whatever was behind the mutilations it soon began capturing mysterious lights and objects in the sky, along with other unexplainable phenomenon. When Lee had a sighting of what he believed to be a set of red eyes belonging to the Beast itself in a field late one night, it only served to intensify his search for answers. Before long Lee had begun filling photo albums with evidence of unusual occurrences taking place on his farm. - I basically had a deer out for three years, three to four years. There was things happening with the deer and the lights, they were very close together. - He had the idea of bringing a small deer that he found, it was a 60 pound roadkill deer. - And then a mist came and like cloaked it, and then the deer's gone. - The deer set down in kind of a little nest of grass on the edge of his property and when he came back the deer was gone. He thought aha, it'll be on the trail camera. He looked at it, and at the time that the deer would have had to have been taken this strange mist appeared, and it was in frame after frame after frame. In the first beginning you can see the deer's hoofs lying there and in the last frame the deer is gone. - I said let's go look for tracks, so we go look for tracks. There's these five toed, seven pad tracks that I have many pictures of and castings off along the edge of the field. - And he could see that there were tracks that looked like large canine prints deeply embedded in the soil and there was only the hind set, and it had to go somehow over a barbed wire fence and into the next field. He and a friend of his followed it all the way through that field to where it ended up at another road and they had to stop. - I've gone to the Field Museum, they sent me to a track expert, who said these are not tracks, these are not animals. They said, you can go to home depot and buy stilts and walk around your field and make those tracks. There's nobody walking around my field with stilts. I tried universities, University of Wisconsin, I tried to talk to them. I've tried VNR, they tell me it's an abnormal coyote, and they've looked at the tracks, oh that's an abnormal coyote. - Lee's farm seems to be uniquely positioned to reveal new information about the mysteries of Bray Road. The data he's collected thus far implies that the wolf man or whatever it is, is only one piece in a much larger puzzle. If this impression is true, it begs the question, why does this puzzling phenomenon appear to recur over and over again in South East Wisconsin? The phenomenon Lee's witnessed on his property also seems to connect some of the stranger aspects of the modern day monster to its ancient ancestors. Whether the dog man, if it exists, is merely a mythological figure, a misplaced, uncataloged animal, or something far beyond our understanding its presence continues to challenge those that seek answers, causing people like Lee and Linda Godfrey to continually seek new explanations for a mystery that might never be solved. - I believe it exists, I've seen it. I have evidence, I'm past that, now I want to to know where is it coming from? Does it really live here? Why does it need food at all, does it actually use it for food? That's my pursuit. - While Wisconsin is known for its dairy cows, cheese curds and endless fields, its town of Elkhorn is known more for it's beast. Yet in the years since the first sightings the town has done little to embrace the legend that has grown around their local monster. In the 90s at the height of the Bray Road media frenzy, t-shirts were sold, and today you can still find the silver bullet special at the local bar. But aside from the occasional curiosity seeker asking for directions to the werewolf Elkhorn is just another small Midwestern town. - I don't know that it's got a commercial value to it. There's a little bit of notoriety, but then there's still a lot of people in the area that have never actually heard of it. - I'm gonna say that people still want to turn their backs on it, for the tourism, Elkhorn's not a big touristy town. But you've got to remember the people that are really interested in this, it's a small portion of the population, they're not trying to market it to the mainstream. - So it's always been a divided reaction in the town and I think that's to be expected. - I've had stuff sent to me from magazines in the back of airline seats about the Beast of Bray Road from friends that are traveling. All around the country I'll have people say, Bray, oh like the Beast of Bray Road? So it's amazing how far the story has gone. - In the beginning I thought that the people were seeing something, I did not know what it was, and I still don't claim to know for sure what it was. The newspaper was selling lots of t-shirts and they asked me to do a poster they could hand out to people for it. I was okay with that, I actually have a cartoon in one of the papers that had a cartoon drawing of the werewolf being psychoanalyzed, because all the people were driving me, you know it was just kind of a fun thing. Somewhere in there I came to a point where my curiosity blended with the realization that people were seeing something that looked like an upright canine, and nobody knew why, nobody knew what it was. And the sightings continued and continued, and continued. I'm not sure after 26 years that I feel that comfortable really joking about it because I've learned that it runs so deep worldwide in so many channels, so many places that I think there's a lot more to it then appeared on the surface back in '91, '92. And why it popped up in Elkhorn I'll never know. - In many ways this lonely stretch of road in Walworth County Wisconsin is completely ordinary. No different then the thousands of byways which cut through the heartland of America. And perhaps that is the most unsettling element in the flat pastureland of the Midwest, or the haunted meadows of Europe it can be anywhere. On quiet back roads late at night, or in your own backyard in broad daylight. Whatever this creature is the Bray Road Beast is an intruder, a being which forces itself into the lives of those unlucky enough to see it. It could happen anywhere, at any time, it could happen to you.
