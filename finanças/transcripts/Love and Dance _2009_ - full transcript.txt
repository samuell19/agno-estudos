Starring: Screenplay: Music: Director of photography: Directed by: - Are you nuts? - Sorry. Go right in. Hi, bro. What time are you showing up for work? Hold it. Don't fool around. Stop it! - Miss Brzozowska? - Yes. Please, come in. I've had enough of it. This way. Thank you, sir, for making time for me. I'm glad we finally meet. - Call me Remigiusz. - Hania. Slawek told me so much about you that I fell like we've known each other... for ever. So... you'd like to write for "Collette". Very much. Hania, make yourself at home. See you tomorrow at 8.00. Okay? Your attention, please. We've had a long journey and Mr. Kettler is tired. Please, come to our press conference, tomorrow at 3.00 pm. - Just a few questions? - Tomorrow at 3.00. Hotel Westin. No pictures. See you tomorrow. LOVE AND DANCE - It's cool. - Are you hurt? - Everything is under control. - Slawek? - I'll kill you! -Mom, I wanted a Natalia Jaroszewska dress. Slawomir, do you want to take this alien woman as your wife? I'd rather wear jeans at my wedding. That's a pretty one. It'll show off your figure. - Are you kidding? - It's sexy. I'm begging you... How about this one? - What? - Looks like nun's frock. - Mom... - You're so pretty. Emphasize your beauty. Show off some leg, shoulders, breasts. - You've got such a great bosom. - Stop it. - I'll go crazy. - Sit up straight. - I'll shut up. - Finally. - What are you looking for? - I had a job interview. - I've got my first assignment. - What? - For "Colette". - Great. Aren't you happy? - It's a lousy assignment. - How lousy? I have to write about dancing. Some kind of competition - or championships. - Dance is something extraordinary. People love "Dancing with Stars". I'd like to compete myself. - Why don't you? - I'm no star. To me you are. Let's take tango... - I'll dance at your wedding. - You'll be great. After a 20-year Absence, Jan Kettler arrived in Poland today. A famous dancer, choreographer, teacher and, as the critics call him, dance creator. He gained fame and recognition, appearing in numerous musicals. He comes here as a teacher for "European Dance Show", a prestigious dance tournament. The competition will be fierce, but there is a lot at stake: a scholarship on Broadway. - Don't talk to me. - What's the matter? - You know very well. - Did I push you off the scaffolding? What should I say at the audition? "I'm a great dancer - but I limp? " - So don't go anywhere. - I'm not going to pull out, dad. - What do you need this dancing for? - For everything. - We have to meet the deadline. There's more to life than a building site. Don't you get that this dancing is of no consequence? - You just sweat for nothing. - Tomorrow I'm off. Let these people wait Life is no picnic. No way. In 2-3 weeks we’ll finish - the job and then we'll see. - It's an audition. Nobody’ll wait. - An audition! - That's right. - You've promised. - Yeah... Dad... Are you letting him? Kid, tomorrow you come to work. End of discussion. - Did I wake you up, my lark? - Your lark was asleep. Get up. It's 8.04 a. m. Did you chose the wedding dress I've chosen for you? Not yet. Guess who's in my chair right now? Remigiusz. Say, "hi". He told me everything. My darling journalism starlet. - I believe in you. We'll you make it? - I'll try. I've to go, because my patient is getting impatient. Bye. I love you. Wojtek! Get down! Tomorrow, you'll get rid of me. Please, turn it on. - Let's go. - Do what you want. How could you? Why haven't you told me? I was afraid. You've always seemed to young for that. - Even now. - I'm 24 years old. - I didn't want to hurt you. - Were you going to tell me - I have a father? - Every day of every year I kept promising myself I'd tell you, but I couldn't. After Jan had left I thought I'd die, but than you were born. And I stopped missing him so very much. You can't plan everything. - We were young. - But not too young to have a child. Times were different then. Everyone wanted to get away. Jan got a chance to dance in New York. But he didn't forget us. He wrote letters, called. I kept sending him pictures and received back programs, where his name was written in bigger and bigger letters. The years went by and I stopped fooling myself that he'd return. It was not easy. He didn't come to see me even once? - Why didn't you fight for him? - How? Should I had taken you across the ocean and waited for him at the theater entrances? - Hello? - Basia, it's me, Jan. - Hi. - Have you told her? - I have. - And? It's not up to me or to you, now. I see... Hania knows where to find you. You, sir... The press names you among the best choreographers of the last 2 decades. "Dance Variety" says you've opened the dance history of the 21. century, and that dance without Jan Kettler won't be the same. The press lies. What is your definition of dance? Dance is not easy to define. Everyone is different. Everyone is unique. This uniqueness has to express itself. Otherwise it will be lost. Dance is a way to offer the world the only thing we can offer - ourselves. Madam... Why are you working in Poland for free? It's not true that every emigrant who achieves success abroad forgets about Poland. I haven't forgotten. I've got a lot of debts to pay. I'm glad to be able to help these young people, so they wouldn't have to make it the hard way. If you want to be good at something you don't have to give up everything. Unfortunately, I understood it too late. Do the dancers you'll choose stand a chance to win "European Dance - Show"? - Why these win or loose categories? It is said that the couple you choose - supposedly always wins. - Supposedly. Is it true that you left your family in Poland? Go ahead. Great guy. - Pardon? - Kettler. Do we know each other? Don't you remember me? I don't remember we're on first name basis. Don't you remember me, miss? A trash monster? So you came down from the sky into a dumpster. - Are you all right? - Everything's fine. I fell from a scaffolding. But into the trash. Tomorrow, we start with the auditions. - Does he interest you? - Not at all. - I've seen you at the press conference. - Big deal. - I'm writing an article about him. - That's great. Nothing out of the ordinary. Then perhaps we'll see each other because I'm going to the audition. - Wojtek. - Hania. 5,6,7,8... Number 69, thank you. Next group. Number 2. Thank you. Monika? That's enough. Let's see them one by one. It must've hurt. Number 61. He's already on my list. I'll be right back. Hi, Wojtek. What are you still doing here? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... What a feather-head I am. Sorry. You were very good. Sure. I shouldn't have come here. What was I expecting? It's not my world. You were really good. You don't dance. What do you know? I think you're the best. You really want to be like him? You know what I do. I'll never be like him. But I'll do anything to be able to dance. I'm sure you'll make it into the second round. Really. You'll see. I have a tape of his performance from 1983. Unbelievable. - No school teaches things like that. - I haven't even been born then. I'd like to see it. - Come inside. - I'll wait here. I'll be right back. - Won't stop very soon. - I don't have any choice. - Are you hungry? - No, thanks. I'm cooking spaghetti. Would you like some? No, thank you. It's Marcin's collection. - From India. - From India? Cool. I liked his words about the language of soul. It was lame. Why do they make such a big fuss over him? Maybe because the man's a genius. He's perfecting every move, and it also brings him joy. It's a mixture of hard work and great fun. You don't get it. - Let's take you. - Why? What do you do for fun? - Lots of things. - For example? - I ride my bicycle. - And... But I was determined. I heard screams of all the animals skinned alive and said: "Don't wear fur". That's it? - I collect stamps. - Pardon? I collect stamps. - With butterflies. - It changes everything. - My pals. - I've had enough of you, your buckets... But I'll stay. My friends: Kuba, Marcin, Platon. - Hello, stranger. - Hi. - Hania. - Platon. Hi, Kuba. Hania... - Thank you. - Did you eat? - We did. - Did you wash up? - Marcin, please. Sure I did... - But after lunch? Kuba... Sit down. Don't get so emotional. It's cool. But if you bring a girl here - you should tidy up. - No. It's not a girl. I mean my... - She's... - A friend. Right. - I'll get going. - No way. - Sorry, we've interrupted you. - We're having a nice talk. - What were you chatting about? - I was going to show Hania the TIT. - Truth in Truth. - Right now? What is Truth in Truth? - I've got to run. - Sit down. - The world is made out of music. - Platon, you choose. Hania, it was a tone. - Single and rhythmical. - Okay, I'll choose. A carpet. - What's going on? - The neighbors come home at 4.30. It's after 4.00? Maybe two-tone will be appropriate? White and yellow gold work great together. Maybe satin alternating with shiny finish? I feel... I feel... we're very close. Would you like tea or coffee? And as usual we'll start with catalogues. That's right. - Are you angry? - I'm not. But you know that I don't like to be late. Even more when somebody else is not on time. - You were almost half an hour late. - I know. Sorry. - But the wedding bands are beautiful. - They are? Do you want to see them? Maybe later. Be careful. What are you doing? Look at Trusia. Why are you licking my ear? We promised father Walenty to keep chaste until the wedding. - That's right. - So... Honey buns... You've brushed you teeth already. - You're not attracted to me. - How can you say that? - I can see. - I am attracted to you. Let's go to sleep. Okay... Do you want to see? - I do. - But hush! Check it out. Trusia has seen them. - Don't be mad. - I'm reading. Good night. False teeth. These are the rules: no cells, no talking, no pictures. And one more thing. No smoking. - What about an interview? - No interviews. Sorry... I've told you you'd make it. Congratulations. - I'm glad you're here. - I've got your tape for you. Thanks. - Did you watch it? - Several times. Good morning. My name is Jan Kettler. This is Monika, my assistant. Welcome to you all. We'll be working together for the next 3 weeks. Who knows... Maybe we'll learn to dance a little. No, no... Please, wait outside. It'll be better for you to forget you've got private lives. From now on this will be you home. This hall. Let's start. - Do you have Internet access here? - Hi. Nice sweater. Thanks. - Quite a hunk. - What? - You don't stand a chance. - I'm not interested. Wojtek! Catch me. Don't you think that... Hania is a bit absent-minded lately? - Why are you asking me? - Whom should I ask? - Do you have second thoughts? - Sure I don't. Come on... I'll tell you a secret... - Hello? Yeah... - Hania? Hi. Okay, we'll wait. - See you. - Wife. Today we'll divide you into pairs. From now on I don't care about your individual skills. You're connected with your partners. Fully dependent on each other. If one has a sore shoulder, the other one has it, too. One is ill, the other one doesn't dance. One is eliminated, the other one can go look for a regular job. - Does he often behave like this? - Sometimes. A strange man. It's only a game. He's terrible, but gets things done. You want to make an interview with him? - Table for to? - Yes. - Good afternoon. - I'm sorry. I thought that traffic jams were New York specialty - but apparently they're not. Sorry. - That's okay. I appreciate - you've agreed to this interview. - Not at all. Shoot. I'm well equipped but I've got no pistol on me. Let's start... Who are you, really? Pardon? - Would you care for anything else? - Maybe something with chocolate? - Or not. Apple pie. Two pieces. - Certainly. Who are you really, Mr. Kettler? Usually, that's the first question. Frankly, I wanted to ask about something else. - Go ahead. - First question... Is Jan Kettler a man of many faces? I prefer to call him an artist of many incarnations. "A man of many faces" phrase suggests I have something to hide. - And have you? - Secrets? Doesn't everybody? - Why have you left Poland? - When I was young we all were dreaming about working abroad. In my case the dream came true. - Don't you have any regrets? - Why should I regret - being successful? - Am talking about leaving. Don't you have a feeling that you've lost something? Maybe, maybe not. - I'd like to find out. - What? If you could achieve more in dancing? No... Here you go. I'd like to find out... if I could have been a better person. Do you have any kids? A do. One. - A dancer? - No. I don't know. I haven't met her. Can we change the subject? Sure. There is this circus number where a juggler rotates plates on thin sticks. As long as they're turning very fast, everything is fine. He takes one, then another one, a third one, fourth... Occasionally he has to come back to the previous ones because they're slowing down... And sometimes it happens that one of them falls down and brakes. - You are not eating? - I'm not. Please, help yourself. - Seriously? - Yes. Okay, thanks. I've prepared lots of questions but they seem trivial, now. - I just wanted to know... - That's funny. Sometimes a few notes of a tune, a single tone, a taste, a smell can take us back into the past. My fiancée baked the best apple pie in the world. - What was her name? - Basia. It doesn't matter. I don't want to talk about it. It's like with these plates. Sometimes, out of stupidity or carelessness... you drop the most precious one. Wojtek, are you and Hania a serious item? Have you seen, how she dresses? - Quiet normally. - Just like my grandma. Love is like Themis. Blindfolded. And also dresses badly. Tell me something. Have you seen her skirt-pants? - What? - These skirt-pants. I have. And her pumps? - I haven't. - Pumps are shoes for old women. Leave me alone. I simply like her. Buttoned all the way up? Wojtek... You bring a chick home, for the first time just because you like her? - Excuse me? - Yes? - Where is Wojtek? - A good question. Okay, one more time. And look lively. Wojtek? - What are you doing here? - Working. - What about rehearsals? - What? - Rehearsals. - My father broke his leg. - Wojtek, stop chatting. Come. - Stop shouting! Have you given up? Sorry, I can't talk. The whole time, you have to feel as if... I don't know... As if you're walking on thin ice. Over a great abyss. And as if with each step, your fate was to be decided all over again. Tragedy or survival. That's why this connection between partners, this never-ending dialogue, this dependency on each other is never so apparent as in tango. It's all fuelled by passions that tear at you. And it takes place in a dangerous demi-monde atmosphere. One has to feel... the stench of shady bars. Spilled blood and booze. Sylwia? Vitamins. For more energy. - Did the pictures turne out okay? - I hope so. Do you know what's up with Wojtek? I don't. When he turns up, remind me to kill him. - Romeo, get to work. - In a minute. - I can't. I have to work. - You can do it after hours. Why are you doing this for me? Because I like you. I like the way you dance. - Does Monika know about it? - She does. She agreed. You know... - You should start with your left foot. - One more time. - From the top? - Yeah. They're getting lower in their knees. From the top? I can't do it by myself. Why not? I need a partner. Sure... Me? You must be joking. I don't dance. I don't... I can't dance. - Seriously. - Come. I'll do everything wrong. You'll trip. I don't know this routine. Starting with your left leg. I'm sorry. I was nosey. I know I shouldn't be here. I'm sorry. It's Jan's daughter. He misses her a lot. He's waiting for her. Thank you. - That's nothing. - It's something. I've got a surprise for you. Tomorrow. Hey. Hi. - New chick? - You don't recognize Hania? - You're looking pretty. - Thanks. Nice outfit. Wojtek, look who's there. - Go dance. - Come with me. - No. - Please. - We take care of her. - You'll join me later? - Sure. - Keep an eye on her. So... - How do you like it here? - Cool. - Your first time? - Yep. Nice dimples. Deep. - Thanks. - Here is to you. He's not bad, huh? Wojtek? He's a cool dancer. - Aren't you jealous? - Of Wojtek? - Not at all. - Jealousy is shallow. That's right. We're only friends. Be quiet. Do you miss your mistress? She'll be right back. Let's start without Hania. - Poker? - Poker. - Would you like to dance? - No, thanks. Although, I know how to dance. I'm going. I read an incredible story today. A Czech couple had met after 30 years, and after a week they were married. Now they're both 70, but as they say, love has won. Sometimes people don't see that love is within reach. You just have to pluck this fruit. - Kasia, how many cards? - One. Here you go, precious. Thank you. Take care of your health because soon you'll have serious problems. With your leg or your tooth. The lid of the trunk fell on my nose. You know what? I haven't expected it. - What? - Such fire. You know... it's because of you. - I've got to go. - Come on... - It's a wet stone's throw from here. - Wet stone's? My brother uses this phrase. It's closer than close. - I've got to go. - It's early. You don't have to go. - Only for a few minutes. - Sure. Beautiful. I knew you'd like it. I dance here. I train. Why have you brought me here? Because I like you. Why? Because you're... funny. - Really? - I mean you're fun. You say you don't dance, and later you're like glued to the dance floor. You say you collect stamps with butterflies. Who does that? - I do. - You are not ordinary. There is something inside of you... that I don't know how to call. A secret, an energy... When we're in the rehearsal hall, just before we start dancing you always brush your hair off your ear. You're different. Different? I just wanted to say that I like you, very much. Don't you sometimes feel like taking off this roof and fly away? A don't have to fly. When I dance with you I don't have to. Shall we dance? Let's go. Thank you. It's been a wonderful night. - See you tomorrow. - Tomorrow. - I mean today. - Yeah. - Where have you been? - With some friends. I was worried. Sorry. I should have called. I've known Marcin for 5 years now. He does some strange things, but for a good cause. Like the environmentalists say: we don't inherit Earth from our parents but we borrow it from our kids. That's a pretty thought. Listen... I wanted to tell you something. Me too. Let me go first. - I'm not free. - Hania! I've been waiting for 10 minutes. I parked the car. - I'm coming. - Who is that? - I'll tell you tomorrow. - Help her. Please. You can't do this. Sorry. Look at that. Look. Give me a tissue. We have to do something about it. You're always late. Into the basket. You're beautiful. What a lucky man I am. You look like a princess. And I'm the prince. What are you doing? Get away from the car. - I didn't do anything. - You'll pay for all damages. - Get away. - I survived two wars, - I'll survive this. - Wojtek... There is not a scratch. - What are you doing here? - Do you know each other? We do. - He is a dancer. - A dancer? - Who is it? - Slawek. My fiancé. Fiancé? Go inside. You'll get the dress all dirty. Honey buns... Why did I have to end up with you? It was better when you were not here. And what? Is that all? You came back only for this? Sylwia! Wojtek! - I want to talk to you. - What about? About your fiancée? - I didn't want to hurt you. - Dream on. Nothing happened. Nothing. - How come? - Did it? - Didn't it? - Leave me alone. Please. - I can't leave it like this. - What? - Us. - Us? You must be joking. - I feel awful about all this. - And I feel good. Wojtek, please... - I'm sorry. - When were you going to tell me? - I don't know. - You don't know? You don't? Go back to your fiancée. Leave me alone. There's a reason we've all gathered here. I've chosen a couple for the championships. But first of all, I'd like to thank you for your hard work. Also, I'd like to thank Monika. Every one of you is a great dancer. I don't say it to be polite. As you know it's not one of my traits. Every one of you is talented. But in this line of work there is no democracy, and only one couple goes on to work with me, and will start in the championships. - I know it's an important moment. - Say it. The place in the tournament goes to Sylwia and Wojtek. Bravo! Congratulations. Ask her to dance. - Who? - Hania, the reporter. Come on... What's the big deal? You're right. Would you like to dance? Maybe you've chosen a wrong occupation? Dance is in my blood. I've got to talk to you. Sounds serious. It's personal. Call an ambulance. She had it on her. - What's that? - Etaxin. Curbs appetite, gives a kick. Fuck! Who's going to dance? Iwka and Maciek. That's it? What about Wojtek? Pardon? Great. For a minute there I thought that you were a sensitive man. But do you know who you are? A cold, heartless egoist. Who is asking you? Get hold of yourself. - You don't have any feelings. - It's none of your business. You use people. You preach the magic of dancing and when you don't need them - you get rid of them. - Don't butt in. Why? Because I've told the truth about the great Jan Kettler? Another plate fell and broke into pieces. Other people's feelings are nothing compared with art. - Who are you to talk to me like that? - It's worth to sacrifice people, just as you sacrificed me and my mom. Hania! Hanka! Wait. Wait, please. I can't talk to you right now. Sorry. We'll have to meet. Okay? Do you want to talk? I don't. You can still change everything. You knew. Didn't you? Men are blind. All of them. It's not too late. Don't whine. - Are you lost? - We're here to see Wojtek. Is he in? Wojtek? You look great. You, too. I've met Hania. I know. Can we talk? Talk. I don't know if it's at all possible. But I would do anything to be a part of her life again. You have never been in her life. - I'll be going. - Don't go. Come inside. I'll make us some tea. Are you getting married? Hania is. When? Tomorrow. With Wojtek? With Slawek. Who's Slawek? Who's Wojtek? Today is a great day for Polish dancing. Because today a Polish couple will win. Don't worry. We'll win. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome... - Would you like to read it? - I wouldn't. - "Jan Kettler, a master, a teacher..." - Give me that. Jan Kettler, a master, a teacher, a dance guru. He's come back to Poland to teach the most talented young dancers. The practice itself under his watchful eye will be a great reward for the finalists The chosen couple will take part in a tournament, "European Dance Show". What is Jan Kettler like? Perfect? Not at all. He only has a perfect technique. While working, he is a heartless tyrant. Not people but their achievements count. Dance under his guidance become¤ a form of an internal suicide. If that's a price you have to pay to be called a master it's better to remain a man. - Like father, like daughter. - Yeah... She's right. You're the most handsome guy in the world. - Don't move. - An Italian couple, SofiaVico and Marcello Malaparte. This Wojtek is quite handsome. What is it? It was my greatest love. That's me. I loved him very much. Never again was I so happy. Today I regret I didn't take a chance and I didn't follow him to New York. I was afraid. But you... You don't have anything to be afraid of. - Why are you telling me all that? - Love is the most important thing. I've lived through mine. It was not long, but true and great. - And you? - What about me? Are you living through a great, real love? I am. A shot of congnac to get you some courage. I think you'll win. Do you? I'm sure of it. Great. I've always wanted to win. I'm only not sure you're competing for the right prize. It's too late. You've got 40 minutes. I don't know what church it is at. I do. Are you ready for the grand finale? For the final showdown, let's welcome Wojtek and Wioletta. Sometimes one has to wait to get what he wants. Let's welcome Wojtek, Wioletta. Wojtek, Wioletta... It won't work. Come. - Where's my son? What's wrong? - What's going on? I called for a taxi. Wait a second! - I can't take all of them. - You have to. I'm paying. You've split from a wedding? No. I want to get to one. - Sonny... - Wojtek! What are you doing here? Once a passenger asked me if I'd take a foreign currency. Of a Republic of Mercy. I said, "no". I thought I'd die of shame. And I though I'd die of despair. Where will we start from? From the beginning. We have to find a new dance partner for you. Subtitles: TVN Text: Iwona Iwanska
