[ominous music] Through my life journey, I've come to discover the most beautiful love story ever told. The Book of Revelation is not about doom and gloom as so many people think. It's about the revelation of Jesus Christ, who he is, and what he's done for us. The book of Revelation is one of the only books that offers a blessing to whoever reads it. It's one of the most extraordinary books I've ever read. It starts off with a warning to the seven churches. The first is the Church of Ephesus, who God congratulated on the patience and labor for him. But he had one thing against them. They lost him, their first love. He wanted them to repent or he would come quickly and remove their candlestick. If they overcame, he'd let them eat the tree of life. The Church of Smyrna, though poor, was spiritually rich. They went through much tribulation for 10 days, but God told them to be faithful to death and he'd give them the crown of life. The Church of Pergamum, who dwelled where Satan's seat is, yet held fast to God's name and didn't deny the faith. Yet God had several things against them. They held onto wrong teachings of Balaam, which sought to set stumbling blocks for God's children. Eat things, sacrifice to idols, and commit sexual acts of fornication. God warns them to repent, or he would fight against with the sword of his mouth. And if they overcame, he'd give them manna and a new name, written in a white stone. To the Church of Thyatira, whose charity, service, and works were known by God, but he had a few things against them. They tolerated that woman, Jezebel, which called herself a prophetess, which taught and seduced God's servants to commit fornication. He would cast her on a sick bed. And those that commit with her will have great tribulation unless they repent and turn. And he will kill their children with debt. And all the church will know that he searches the hearts. To him that overcomes, he will give him power over the nations, and he will give him the morning star. The Church of Sardis, who was commanded to be watchful and strengthen within them that are ready to die. He commands them to repent and watch, or he will come upon them like a thief. The Church of Philadelphia, who have little strength, yet didn't deny God's name. God sets an open door before them and made those in the synagogue of Satan that called themselves Jews and were not, but lied. God will make them come to worship at their feet. And to the Church of Laodiceans, who is neither hot, nor cold, but lukewarm. God says he will vomit them out of his mouth. So they are rich, increased, and need nothing, but they don't know they're poor, wretched, and miserable, blind and naked. He stands at the door and knocks. And if any hears his voice, he will come in and sit with him. The one who holds the seven stars, whose head and hair were white like wool, whose eyes were flame of fire, whose feet are bronze, like fine brass burned in a furnace, whose voice with the sound of many waters. In chapter 4, it goes into talking about the throne that John saw set up in heaven and one that sat on that throne. Around the throne were 24 elders, with white clothing and gold crowns. Lightning and thunder proceeded from the throne, and a sea of glass like crystal were before the throne. Four beasts full of eyes were in the midst of the throne. One was like a lion, other, like a calf. Another had the face of man. And another was like a flying eagle. Each of them had six wings. They were full of eyes, and they rest not, day and night, saying, "Holy, holy, holy, "Lord God Almighty, which was and is to come." And when they give glory to God, the 24 elders fall and throw their crowns before the throne. And at the right hand of him who sat on the throne, there was a book. And a strong angel proclaimed, "Who's worthy to open the book and loose the seals?" And no man in heaven, nor Earth, or under the Earth was found worthy enough to open the book, neither to look therein, except for one. The lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David has prevailed to open the book and loose the seven seals. And when the Holy Land took the book, the Elders sung a new song, "You are Worthy." But this book, this book that no one was worthy to open, is where it all began. And the seals, the opening of seals, is the beginning of the most unforgettable journey that no one will ever forget. But you may be wondering, who am I? And where do I fit into this story? My name is Joanna Shepherd, and I don't know how it all started or how it all began, all I remember was there was no peace. [dramatic music] Mom? [dramatic music] Dad. Evan. [gunshots fire] [dramatic music] I don't know what happened. One second everything was fine. The next second, all hell broke loose. Trains started derailing. Computer and data systems started going down. Planes started crashing. People started panicking for no good reason. I haven't gotten any sleep, because they've been breaking in and killing nonstop. There's no peace. I know. They broke into my house. I heard gunshots inside. I can't find my mom or my dad or my brother. Don't worry, I don't know where my family is either, but at least we have each other. Do you remember that time in the second grade when that girl with the big buck tooth tried beating us up? Yeah, and you thought you had superpowers, so you pulled out your magic wand to stop her. She took it and snapped it in half. And you tried to jump in and save us, and she ended up head-butting you. Yeah, I couldn't let you get beat up alone. We had to get beaten up together. You're my girl. You know, when all of this happened, I thought I lost you. I went to your house and I couldn't find you. I prayed you'd be okay. And here you are. [gentle, sad music] So now what? I guess we wait and see. [gentle, sad music] Today the world leaders have gotten together and decided the only way to secure peace in their countries is to have one world leader. Today a new world leader has been chosen to take the position of becoming the leader of the entire world. Never before has this event happened. The chosen leader has accepted the invitation and is eager to take on the challenge. Some idiot stole my car. Where did you just come from? What are you doing? I'm calling my job. Stupid phone's dead. You're not going back out there. I've been late ever since I got this job. He'll fire me. I haven't been there in four days. Are you kidding? He probably hasn't been there in four days, either. It's crazy out there. People are outside shooting each other, and you're talking about going to work. Do you want me to stop my life? We won't have a house if I do that. [gentle, sad music] The dumb landlord's talking about barricading us in or evicting us if we don't pay. After all this, his only focus is money. He doesn't care. And he vows to work harder than ever to bring world peace and unity. The new world leader plans to make a seven-year peace treaty with Israel. In this treaty, he also agrees to rebuild the Promised Temple for Israel. He states, "If we would like peace, "we must first give." [airplane engine roars] [exploding] [ominous music] [yelling and screaming] I think it looks better on me. [they yell and mumble] [ominous music] [hand pounding] Help me, help me. Help me [cries]. Help me. [ominous music] Help me, help me. Help me [cries]. Help me. [she pants and cries] Eva, you okay, what happened? Please don't leave me [cries]. I'm not going to leave you. Please, they're gonna kill me. [she cries] She's pregnant, Fay. They tortured her and beat her to a pulp and said they're coming back to kill her and beat her child out of her. I understand that, but we can't afford to take in every wounded person. Fay, she's like family to me. Remember, she used to babysit me all the time? Please, I can't put her back out there and sleep peacefully. She's the only one, Fay, please. [dramatic music] As time went on, things got worse. We later found out that Fay's job closed down because the owner was killed. It became hard to get things necessary for living. And the stores were closed down, abandoned. Soon the focus of our lives revolved around fighting for our survival, finding things off of the bodies of dead people became a norm for our day-to-day living. Every day, our lives drastically changed. There was nothing we could do about it. [dramatic music] Excuse me, sir. Do you have a lighter? I'm sorry, I didn't get that. You really thought you were gonna fool somebody. [dog barks] [he mumbles] [she pants] Oh my God, oh my God. Oh my God. [she pants] I'm gonna kill you. [dog barks] Open the door, open it, now. [they cry] He tried to get me. Who tried to get you? They're coming to get me, they're coming to get me. Oh, please, save me. No one's coming to get you, Eva. They're coming right now, they're coming. They're coming to get me. Oh please, save me. They're coming to get me. [they cry and yell] They're coming to get. [gentle, sad music] There isn't any more food. Should I go to the store and buy something? [ominous music] I'm going with you. Thanks. [ominous music] [hand pounding] Do you have any weapons? Yes, but they're - for protection. - Give it to me. No. Then you cannot come into my store. We're just trying to buy food. Do you have any weapons? No. You may come in, but not the other. How much is this bread? 39.99. Where's the food? A loaf of bread costs 40 bucks. What? Yeah, we should burn his store down. The next one's six miles down, but I refuse to walk that far here. Gus Hefferson? I found it on the body of some dead guy. Just use the money. [ominous music] Eva. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I was so hungry, please, please forgive me, please. Sorry, I was so hungry. Please don't be mad, please. Please don't be mad, please, please. Please don't be mad at me, please. Studies show that approximately one-fourth of all mankind has been killed in the last couple of months. Wars, hunger, and unexplainable deaths are to blame for this catastrophe. The newly elected world leader's heart grieves for those people, and he vows to work harder than ever to bring world peace and unity. We are coming up with a way to enhance security for your safety. We plan to come up with a system to protect you from ATM fraud, enhance airport security from terrorists, for schools, for medical care, for voting, even for buying things. And we believe a chip implant in each individual is the solution. We are working diligently to bring this to pass and to make sure every human receives one. That way, we will be able to locate and track down the criminals quicker. We are doing everything we can to provide food from the least to the greatest. I understand that we are all facing difficult times, but I give you my word, we will all get through this together. [she breathes heavily] [ominous music] I'm gonna rob the grocery store on the corner. If you want to come, you can. [ominous music] I'll shoot the store owner. [ominous music] The door, it's open. [ominous music] I think I found the store owner. [upbeat music] [ominous music] I told you I'd find you. [ominous music] You all right? No. Brian? Yeah, it's me. You know him? Yeah, he's one of my neighbors. We gotta get that knee patched up, or else it'll get infected. Come on. [she grunts] [ominous music] Christians, I see. No, Boss, injuries. - Injuries? - Yeah. You mean you revealed our secret place to strangers because of an injury? What was I supposed to do, let her die? I told you time and time again, not to bring strangers here. And you still will not listen. What must I do, kill you, too? I got an idea. I mean, we should just teach him a lesson, Boss. Okay, wait, hold on, hold on, guys. What if we use them to get to the Christians? Think about it. Come on. We can use them to seed the Christians into showing us where their hiding places are, huh? Hold on. You're a smart boy, very smart boy. Mason, give the girls whatever they need. Go, go. [she cries] They're coming to get me. They're coming to get me. They're coming to get me. Forgive her, she's been through a lot. What's wrong with you? She will be put on the streets tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't you think it's a little soon for her? No, men, escort this young woman to a room and show her what she must do. The rest of you, put on your clothes. We are going out for a night on the street. [men cheer] [gentle, sad music] For Jesus, thank you, Lord. The Lord has protected us. I've never seen so many animals eat and attack humans. I mean, the Scripture said it would happen, and so it has. What Scriptures? The Bible. Are you a new believer? Yeah, sort of. Well, let me warn you about something. They're gonna come and remove all the Bibles from the Earth. They're gonna destroy them, burn them. So go out and grab as many as you can. Careful who you talk to. Do not trust anybody. They hate you with a passion. [ominous music] If you don't remember anything else I tell you, remember this: do not take the mark of the beast. The mark of the beast? It's the number, 666. The Bible says a man's gonna come and rule the world for several years, and he's going to make everybody, no matter how small or great, worship him and receive the mark, 666, on their forehead, on their right hand. Those that do are gonna go to hell forever. There's no forgiveness, no second chances. So go out and warn as many people as you can, not to receive the mark. When will this man rule the world? You'll find out in good time. Let's go. [gentle, sad music] And held a bolt, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest. Hey, everyone. She's a new believer in Christ. She was in search of other Christians, so I said I'd introduce her to all of us. - Hey, I'm Bev. - Hi. We're going over the Book of Revelations. Do you have a Bible? No. All right, don't worry about it. We got plenty of them here. Yeah, you can keep it. Thank you. Okay, where was I? Revelations 6. Yes. When the lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, "Come." Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. His rider was given the power to take peace from the Earth and to make men slay each other. To him was given a large sword. Samantha? When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, "Come." I looked, and there before me was a black horse. Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand. Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures saying, "A cord of wheat for a day's wages, "and three quarts of barley for a day's wages. "And do not damage the oil and the wine." When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, "Come." I looked, and there before me was a pale horse. Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the Earth to kill by sword, famine, and plague, and by the wild beasts of the Earth. When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, "How long, oh Lord, holy and true, "until you judge and avenge our blood "on those who dwell on the Earth." Then a white robe was given to each of them, and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until both the number of their fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they were, was complete. I looked when he opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as sapphire. And the moon became like blood. And the stars of heaven. [ominous music] [man growls] [people scream] Kill them, kill them all. Kill them. [they yell] Kill them. What are you doing? [gunshot fires] [gentle, sad music] All right, shut up. I want you to shoot the person next to you. If you do not, I will kill you. If you do, I will let you live. - Shoot her. - No. [dramatic music] Shoot her. [dramatic music] Shoot her. [dramatic music] [gunshot fires] [woman screams] [woman moans] Shoot her. [ominous music] Your tears will do nothing for you. Now shoot her. No. Give me your hand. [they scream and cry] I will keep doing it until you shoot her. Shoot her. Take the gun and shoot her now. [dramatic music] [gunshot fires] [ominous music] Look what you've done. You've broken one of your commandments. See you in hell. [gunshot fires] [ominous music] [woman cries] [dramatic music] Hey, you okay? Am I okay? Yeah. How could you be so nice and caring one minute, and shoot someone in the head the next? Joanna, they're Christians. They're the reason why all this is happening. They don't deserve to live. You know what? I'm sorry, but can you just leave me alone for a little while? I need some time to breathe. Yeah, yeah, okay, sure. - Want a glass of water? - No. I just want to be left alone. [she sobs] [ominous music] Is that my food? Get up, get up. Get up. Who said you can eat my food? Hey, stop it. Drop it. No, you drop it, drop it. Drop it, Brian. Well, look at what we got here. I got an idea. How about we all die? Just shoot me, I'm serious, I want to die. - Shoot me. - Don't tempt me. Wait, please have mercy on her. I'm begging you, please don't shoot her. - Get up. - I'll get you some food. Just give me time. I'll give you five minutes. To find food? I need more time than that. [alarm ticks and bell rings] I can't do that. Time's ticking. Hurry. Go. [ominous music] In a few moments, our fate will be determined. [she pants] [ominous music] [clock ticks] [ominous music] Good girl, good girl, Joanna. She told me to get her food. She's the one you want. Stay still. [ominous music] What's in the bag? What's in the bag? Please, don't hurt me, don't hurt me. [ominous music] [dog barks] [ominous music] [alarm rings] [ominous music] I got the food. I got the food. Where's Eva? Where's Eva? I got the food. I got the food, where's Eva? Follow me. But I got the food. Follow me. Joanna. Eva. Joanna, how I missed you. I missed you, Joanna. I want all of you to leave, Brian, you too. If I ever see any of you again, I will kill you. [gentle, sad music] Well, at least we have a radio. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. Hopefully it works. Of course not. I wonder what happened to the family that lived here. Why do you keep carrying that book around? What book? That big brown thing sticking out of your pocket. What if what was happening was written in this book? What do you mean? In the meeting, we were reading it, and the exact same things that were written in this book are happening now. Is that the Bible? What if it's true. Joanna, it's not. No, think about it, Fay. What if the next event that is said to happen, happens? What if it does? [ominous music] And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and lo, there was a great earthquake. And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood. And the stars of heaven fell onto the Earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind. And heaven departed as a scroll... Joanna! Stop it. [gentle, sad music] Soon it will not be him over here, and him over there. No more war and fighting. It will be peace. We will all be one, one nation, one people, one currency, one government, one voice. [dramatic music] Make sure you grab anything of importance. [gentle, sad music] What are you reading? What are you reading, huh, huh? - Huh? - Brian, please. Why are you trying to hide it from me? - Brian. - What? Joanna, did you find any money in the book? Then throw the book away, and look in the next one. I always heard people kept money in books, so I told her to go look through the books. You weren't really going to shoot her. Why are you so against Christians? You're so stupid, that it doesn't make any sense. Don't you see? This has nothing to do with the Christians. Christians is just a code name. They're aliens. And they're the reason for all of this. But this is just the beginning. Soon their king will come down on clouds from the sky and destroy us all. You may not believe me now, but you will, you all will. That's why we've got to unite and fight. And if she's gonna be reading that mess, she's gonna become one of them, and she's gonna destroy us. And that's why we've got to destroy them first. That book is poison. We can't let that poison spread. [ominous music] I'm sorry. Brian has really gone crazy. He was talking about Christians and aliens and how they've come back and how we must destroy them. Now go and find. [hand pounds] [ominous music] Who you guy talking about? [ominous music] I was talking to her about those Christians that we must destroy, and we made a vow to make sure that every single one of them is annihilated. [ominous music] Finish getting the stuff. [ominous music] We have got to leave now. [ominous music] Hey. Hey. Whoa, whoa. Get lost. All right, listen, old man. I'm not going to hurt you. All I want is a smoke. You ain't getting nothing from me. [thudding] [ominous music] [he hums] [ominous music] Joanna. Fay. [he growls] [ominous music] [dramatic music] We got away from Brian, but it was hard to figure out our next move. [ominous music] Eva was due to have a baby any day. Turn it off. She was having a hard time following. I think we need to leave her. What, no. I don't trust, you don't trust anyone. They didn't trust her, and she thought we should leave her. She was trying to lie on you to lose God. I couldn't do such a thing. I'm not leaving her. [she cries] And in the midst of it all, when nothing seemed to work out right, the strangest thing happened. Joanne? Who are you? [they cry and mumble] I ran into my brother Evan. [ominous music] You okay? [ominous music] He happened to find an abandoned house in the forest and was staying there for shelter. [ominous music] [she moans] Eva gave birth to a beautiful baby, which became more of an issue than we thought. We weren't capable of caring for ourselves, let alone a baby. You're holding her wrong, Eva. It's okay, it's all right, Baby. It's fine, you're good. Good baby, hey, yeah. Evan was really good with creating electricity. He knew how to wire things together and create an electrical current. Oh, it's a match. Or it's you finding a way to hack the system and steal electricity. Don't get mad at me because I'm the brains of the family. He had all the lights turned on. He even had the television. I can't believe you're doing so well. Yeah, I know. It's a miracle I found this place, but the only reason it's so good is because it's far from the city. This place would've been any closer, it wouldn't have been any good. Oh, did you hear about that nuclear explosion? No. Wiped out everything moving. How did you hear about it? Oh, we got a television in the back. Oh, we're high rollers, huh. Yeah, you know we're live in the luxury. Oh look, check this out. You can take off your coat, too. [gentle, sad music] As I continued to read, I began to see the comparisons between the scriptures and the things that began to happen in reality. It fascinated me. After the seventh seal was opened, seven trumpets resound. In Revelations 6, when the seven trumpets were to sound, hail, fire, and blood were thrown on the Earth. One third of the trees were burnt up, and all of the green grass was burnt. One third of the sea became blood, and on the second trumpet, one third of the creatures in the sea died. And one third of all the ships were destroyed. [gentle, sad music] A great sword from heaven called Wormwood fell on the rivers and fountains of water. And many men died of bitter waters. Wormwood, the star of wormwood fell onto the waters and made it bitter. And many men died. One third of the moon and one third of the stars was darkened. One third of the day was dark. And one third of the night was no light. And many things began to happen. It's never been this dark. And a star fell from heaven to the Earth, and an angel opened the bottomless pit. And smoke and locusts came out of the pit onto the Earth to torment men that didn't have the seal of God on their heads. They would torment men for five months. Men would desire to die, but death would flee from them. Come on. It should be right here. The locusts had faces of men, they had hair of women, and their teeth were like teeth of lions. Do you hear that? Hear what? That. Which? They had tails like scorpions, and their stings were in their tails. And with it, they hurt men for five months. [they cry out] Come on. And the four angels found in the great river of Euphrates were loosed, which were prepared for an hour a day, a month, and a year, to kill one third of the people on the Earth. Why can't I die? I don't want to live anymore. But those that were not killed by the plague, didn't repent of their murders, sorceries, magic, sexual fornication, or thefts. And God will give power to two witnesses, and if any man hurt them, fire comes out of their mouth. And he must in this manner be killed. They have power to shut heaven that it wouldn't rain. And power to turn the waters into blood, and smite the Earth with plagues as often as they will. But they will be killed. And the Earth will rejoice because they tormented them. But in three and a half days, the two witnesses will rise from the dead and ascend to heaven in a cloud. And within that hour, a great earthquake will destroy one tenth of the city, and 7,000 people will be killed. I may seem like I'm crazy, but it's true. Why else would I have the network and illegally stream this? I'm risking my life. If they find me, I'm dead. I'm not doing this for fun or attention. I'm doing this because this is the truth, and the world needs to know. In the last couple weeks, one third of all mankind was wiped out, over two billion people dead. Where else does it mention that? Revelation. Those two men in Israel going off at the mouth wearing sackcloth, they're not just loonies. They're written in the Bible. Yes, they're the two witnesses written in the Book of Revelation, and they're destroying all the Bibles because they have the truth. Now I want you all to look at something. This was footage taken from a camera phone of a young girl that just so happened to be in the mob of people surrounding the two witnesses. Now I want you all to look closely, and look at what happens. You see that? That is real fire coming from their mouths. Where else does it mention fire shooting from people's mouth? Revelation 11:5. It says if any man will hurt them, the two witnesses, fire will shoot from their mouths and devour their enemies. It also mentions that these men will have the power to shut heaven so it won't rain. They can turn the waters into blood, and they can smite the Earth with all plagues as often as they desire. I know I'm risking my life, but the truth must come out. The world needs to know what is going on, because the new world leader is lying to you all. He controls all the media, the television, the radio, internet, and every other outlet. And he's not letting you know the truth. [hand pounding] Okay, so my time is short, but I need you all to listen to me and hear what I'm saying. Now I'm not talking about the witnesses. Those men are from God, but the others that are popping up all over the city, the psychics and mediums and palm readers and magicians telling you the future. This crazy talk about aliens and people trying to imitate what Jesus did, turning water into wine and making things disappear and reappear. This is not magic. This is witchcraft. Demons are behind this. Demons have controlled these people. Demons are using people to bring about the demonic plan and these demons have a plan for your life and for all mankind. The Bible says that if the days are not cut short, all will perish. None would survive. [ominous music] This is not about them. This is not about doing evil. No. This is about something greater, something mightier coming to rule and reign on this Earth, and all this stuff happening. This is just the vehicle he's using to bring about his master plan. This is the tool he's using to usher in his coming. He's using this to separate the sheep from the goats. Those that are truly his from those that are not his. This is the way that God will see the ones that are his and Satan will see the ones that are his by observing who will worship and take the mark, 666, on their right hand or forehead. This is the grand finale, the ending, the climax, the last part of his master plan. This is what we've all been waiting for. The Earth has been growing for this day, the day when the true king is revealed. He is coming. He's coming, and in righteousness, he is going to judge and wage war. He's coming. Are you ready? [dramatic music] [baby cries] It's going to be okay. It'll be okay, I promise. It'll be fine. [baby cries] Don't worry, sweet baby. I promise. You guys find any food? Man, we found nothing. [gentle, sad music] The one second we could see something, the next second it was completely dark. No moon, stars, or nothing. He's so hungry. It's okay, baby, don't worry. I haven't eaten anything in days. [baby cries] It's gonna be okay. But it wasn't. The baby got really sick and died a couple days after. [dramatic music] Things went from worse to becoming unbearable. Because all the grass and trees were burnt up, there were few animals left in the forest. Our only option was to go back to the city and find a store to buy food from. And there weren't many stores. But we found one place underground that was willing to barter and trade food for goods. Evan found a stack of money underneath one of the floorboards, so we decided to take our chances and go to the city. It was either we go to the city and possibly be killed, or wait here and die of hunger. We had no choice but to go. You here to trade? Barter? Yeah. Back room. Well, well, let's see what you got to work with. [he sighs] The money is crap. It has no value. Don't deal. What? [laughs] Where you been the last two years? Throw this stack of paper on the table. Get out of here. No deal. Wait a minute. Let me see that. Is that real gold? Yeah, it's real. Now this I can work with. Sit down, make yourselves comfortable. Choose whatever you'd like. You don't have anything on your forehead. Let me see your right hand. My hand? You don't have anything on your right hand or on your forehead. Where's your mark? My mark? You heard me, your mark. What mark? No man buys or sells without the mark. Where's your mark? [dramatic music] Where's your mark? I'm so sorry. Your mark, where is it? I don't want to cause any trouble. I just want to go home. There won't be a problem if you've got the mark. If you don't have the mark, we've got a problem. Where's the mark? [gunshots firing] [woman screaming] It was the first time we had to shoot and kill a man. We all believed for years that these things were make-believe, but now we see that they are alive and well and recruiting people on Earth to join them. Why? So they can destroy us. Even out of their own mouths, they say that their leader is coming down to destroy us all. This is why we must join together. Anyone that does not receive the mark and worship the image is against us. And they shall be exterminated. They are our enemies, these two wicked men have somehow disappeared after we killed them. They somehow stood on their feet and ascended into a cloud. After they were dead for three and a half days, for three and a half days, their bodies lay dead in the street. And somehow, after they disappeared, a huge earthquake destroyed a tenth of our cities. Sadly, 7,000 men were killed. This is no act of God. As I've warned you before, these are aliens, aliens that tried to sneak down onto the Earth to destroy mankind, but failed. These men somehow flew into the sky on a cloud. They are not from here. That is why we must destroy them at all costs. Anything associated with it must be annihilated, starting with the Christians. Anyone who does not receive the mark or worship the statue is against us. We are now offering bags of silver and gold for anyone who reveals to us the infidels who will not accept the mark and worship the statue. We will not stop until we have rid the Earth of all infidels. [audience applauds and cheers] Eva, what are you watching? Oh, darling, nothing, nothing at all. Nothing. Hey, I'm off to bed, off to bed now. [upbeat music] The next morning, Eva was gone. Then one day. Come on, guys, let's go. They're through this grove. Everything changed. Hurry up. They're right there. They're in the house [mumbles]. [she mumbles under the music] [upbeat music] They're just asleep, come on. Hurry up, let's go. [she mumbles] In the house that's over there. [she mumbles under music] [ominous music] Evan, Fay, get up. Someone's here. - What? - Someone's here. Who? [they pant] This can't be happening right now. Here, look here, take a gun. No. - Take a gun. - No! This can't be happening right now. I want it to end. This can't be happening right now. This can't be happening right here. Look, calm down. Do you want to live? I don't want to die. Now stop that and come on. [she cries] [upbeat music] [ominous music] Oh, no fair, we walked. [ominous music] You go. They're back there, just go and stop standing here and go. Go. You don't want to. Nobody here now. All right, guys, clear out. [she cries and rants] You promised me money. I want the money. [she cries and rants] You promised me money. I want money, you, you. [ominous music] You promised me money. I want my money, my money, yes. Yes. Wait. Give it to me now. [gunshots fire] [ominous music] [they pant and gasp] [ominous music] [they cry and scream] Please don't kill, please don't kill me. [he laughs] Well, there you guys are. [they cry and laugh] You know, I was just thinking about that cold, dark, and depressing day when you left me in that sad and lonely house. You know, I think it's kind of funny we keep running into each other. [they cry] Okay, where's your mark? [man laughs] [man yells and laughs] They're still just stupid. [gunshot fires] [they scream] [gunshots fire] [she screams and cries] You almost hit me. What? [she screams and cries] Hey, hey, hey. [she screams and cries] Yo, she's mine. Well, I don't see her name on you. [gentle, sad music] [thudding and yelling] Get off. This piece of vomit is a Christian. Will you accept the mark? Will you worship Jethro? Answer me yes or no. [dramatic music] If I accept the mark, I'll worship him, he'll return the temple of fire forever. - Answer me. - No. No, I won't accept the mark. No, no! Stop. [dramatic music] You will not hurt her, not now. Why would we do that and spoil all the fun? [slapping] [dramatic music] [she screams] [she grunts] [dramatic music] [thudding] [distant screaming] [man laughs] You're next. You're next.

And one of his heads was wounded to death, but his wound was healed. And the Earth worshiped the beast. He blasphemed God and made war with the saints of God and overcame them, because power was given to him. There will be no more gods, no. Never again will religion show its ugly, dividing face. Today is a new day. There is one God. This day the world will know that I am God. All of you will fall and worship me, and me alone. And anyone who is against what I speak shall be sentenced to death. [ominous music] Here's the patience and faith of saints. And another beast came and made the Earth worship the first beast, and he received the Earth and performed many miracles and made fire come from heaven in front of men. And they made an image of the beast, and they gave life to the image so that the image could speak. [ominous music] And anyone that didn't worship the beast or receive the mark would be killed, but whoever did receive the mark, 666, or worshiped the beast, would be tormented with fire and brimstone forever and ever. After the seven trumpets were sound, seven vials of God's wrath were poured onto the Earth. Painful sores came upon the people that had the mark of the beast and worshiped him. The sea, the rivers and fountains, became as the blood of a dead man. And every living soul in the sea died. God gave them blood to drink because of the righteous souls they killed. God gave the sun power to scorch men with fire that had blasphemed him. Yet the men still refused to repent. And the kingdom of the beast, that wicked leader, was full of darkness. And they gnawed their tongues because of the painful sores they had. And the spirit of devils went throughout the whole world to gather men to the battle of Armageddon. And there was a great earthquake, the greatest and most fierce earthquake since men's existence on Earth. And the great city of Babylon was divided into three parts. And great hail, weighing 60 to 100 pounds, fell from heaven upon them. And Babylon, that great city, shall fall. In one hour, her judgment shall come. In one day, death, mourning, famine, plague shall come, and she shall be burnt with fire. For strong is the Lord who judge her. In her was found the blood of prophets, saints, and all that were slain on Earth. And the marriage of the lamb will come, and the heavens will open. And he that sat came riding on a white horse, and his name is called faithful and true. And in righteousness, he judges and makes war. His eyes are a flame of fire and many crowns. He has a name written that no man knows, but he himself. He is clothed with a vesture dipped in blood. And his name is called the word of God. And the armies in heaven followed him on white horses, white and clean. And out of his mouth shoots a two-edged sword, that he would smite the nations and rule them with a rod of iron. And his name on his clothing and thigh is king of kings and lord of lords. And this world leader, who we will call the beast, and all the kings of the Earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the white horse and his army. And the beast and the false prophet, which deceived the world, were taken and cast alive into the burning lake of fire and brimstone. And the rest of the army was slain with the sword that came out of the rider on the white horse's mouth. And all the birds were filled with their flesh. Satan was cast by an angel into the bottomless pit for a thousand years. And the souls that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus which had not worshiped the beast, his image, or received his mark, reigned with Christ for a thousand years. This is the first resurrection. After the thousand years, Satan will be loosed. And he will again gather the deceived nation for battle against the saints and the beloved city. And fire from God shall come from heaven and devour them. And the devil will be cast into the lake of fire to be tormented forever and ever. And a great white throne will appear. And he who sat on it, from whose face heaven and Earth fled away, will be there. And dead, small and great, will stand before God. And the books will be opened. That is the book of life. And the dead will be judged according to the works they did. And death and hell will be cast into the lake of fire, and a new heaven and a new Earth appeared. The first heaven and Earth and sea passed away. And a holy city, his bride, will come down from heaven. And the tabernacle of God will be with men, and he will live with them. And God will wipe away the tears from their eyes. And there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor pain. For God makes all things new. These words are faithful and true. It is done. Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book. Behold, I come quickly. And my reward is with me to give every man according to his work shall be. I am the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last. Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. But without our dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters, and whosoever loved to make a lie. I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright and morning star. Let the spirit and the bride say, "Come." And let him that hears say, "Come." And let him that of thirst, come. Even so, come Lord Jesus, come. Amen.
