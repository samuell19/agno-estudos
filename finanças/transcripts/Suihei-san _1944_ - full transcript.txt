Become one of the heroes that destroy the U.S. and British navies. Visitor... Norio-san. Oh. Hey, why don't we go to Takayama-kun? Yeah. Let's go. Let's go. Wait a minute. Hey, Mom. Did you ask for me? Didn't you? He doesn't like that. Ask father again. There's not much time left. It's a week before the application deadline. Yes, sir. Alright. It's true. Even Iio-san and Takayama-kun. They all volunteered. Well, you should wait. Your father is in a foul mood. He's a stone head, right? Hmm. He's a stone head? Shinpachi. There you go. Shinpachi. Yes. Shinpachi. Have you finished the underlay? Not yet. What? I'll do it when I get back. How did you spend so many hours doing so little work? I'll be right back. Norio, let's go. Yeah. He can't help it. What's wrong? Hey, does your father ever laugh? Why? You always look scared. Hey, you. You should ease up on him a little bit. It's just a entrance exam. Why won't you let him take it? Hey, you. Can't you hear me? I hear you. What's wrong with him? He needs some space. Oh. You know... Shut up. He's so enthusiastic about this. I know. Shinpachi. You're still awake. Almost finished? Hey, Shinpachi. That's enough. Good night already. Okay? Your dad will do the rest tomorrow. Good night already. So, don't you feel sorry for the child? I don't think you understand why I'm against it. The family business. You want Shinpachi to take over. That's not all. I feel sorry for the kid. You feel sorry for him? You know nothing. First, there's this examination. Very difficult to pass. Even if... even if they do pass, Becoming a full-fledged sailor. It's not easy. Are you listening? I'm listening. There's no way Shinpachi, such a wimp, could serve. Sooner or later, you're going to have to face that. Knowing you. You're too pitiful to see it, aren't you? Perhaps you should talk about it to Yamaguchi who's retiring. Yamaguchi's retiring? Oh. He said his son has joined the marines. He knows a lot about the navy. Ridiculous. Nothing but a lot of boring stories anyway. I ran into a guy who liked to talk about his retirement. It was while I was at a public bath yesterday. Took so long I was in danger of being boiled like an octopus. I've talked to his wife. You might learn what the marines are like, right? I don't want to. No, I don't want to. Especially when it comes to the navy. I'm good at hiding. I'm good at avoiding people like that. I've got more important things to do. Who were you talking to? It doesn't matter. You're a stone head, you are. Complete stone head. Stone head? You should talk. What happened to Morioka-kun? I do not know. They were not there today. Okay. I wonder what's going on. Well, let's go. What's wrong, Shin-chan? Did everyone leave? Did you have a quarrel with everyone? I didn't quarrel. Then why didn't you go with them? Norio-san, you were all going to join the navy, right? I'm not volunteering. Why? 'Cause. Shin-chan, you are very cowardly. You said you were. I can't believe you broke your promise to everyone. You are such a coward. I am not a coward. If that's the case, then why not volunteer? Shin-chan. Is that true? Thank you very much. Thank you for your help. Did you really stop applying? You can't volunteer for the navy without parental consent. You don't know how often I asked. Really? But my dad is stubborn. He just won't let me. Father's a stone... Let's see, what was it? Stone head, right? Oh yeah, it's very hard. Really? My brother's stubborn, too. Once his mind is made up, there's no changing it. It's all stone. Hey, sorry to keep you waiting. Um, actually. My stone head could not come. Stone head? No, um... I would like to ask you a few questions. I see. Ask away. Thank you very much. Um. Father, Morimura-san, is here to see you. Mr. Morimura? What, my husband is here? I wonder what's going on. Um. Go ahead. Uh, oh. It has been a while. Oh. It's been a while. Sorry but... didn't we met at a public bathhouse last night? Yes. Lately, I've become very forgetful. Come on in. Earlier, our chatter was private. Ah. What, you're here? You're the one who's been talking to the retired man so much. You said you didn't want to. What about you? I'm confused. You didn't want to talk to me? No. I was talking about someone else. That guy was an idiot. You're just confused. Excuse her. That's a Tanto, isn't it? You've got a great one. Look at it. This is a good one. Still, it's a pity. This brushwork is bad. This makes me cry. Don't you recognize it? I got this from you. You must have been very proud of yourself. Is that so? This is mine? I see. Well, if you look closely... the work was done very nicely. Oh, you. Don't say such irresponsible things Do you have anything you wanted to ask him? You're the one who wanted to ask. Why don't you just hurry up? Oh, well, thank you very much. You've become quite a young lady. You serve tea like a wife. She's almost finished with school. Come to think of it, these days, I haven't seen your elder son much lately. Yeah. He's a squad leader for recruit training. She's going to serve soon. Is that so? Yeah. I will still come home once or twice a month. Huh, it's tough, isn't it? Yeah. Good day.

Turn around and I'll wash your back. It's okay, Dad. I'll wash yours. What kind of child would tell their parent that? It's really alright. I can do it. We won't be able to wash each other anymore before long. Oh, yeah. Right. Well then, you can wash my back. Not too hard. Sure. Dad, you've lost some weight. I see a shoulder bone. Really? Take it easy, don't push yourself so hard. Don't worry about your father. You just take care of yourself. Tomorrow, you will finally be a sailor. Make sure you do it right. Yeah. Don't talk too much. I am not a strong man, and so your body is not so strong. But, A person has to do what needs to be done. It's not that I can't do it. People can do anything if they want to. Don't you think? Yeah. And then, There will be hard times ahead. There will be sad times. That whenever it happens, you have to gnash your teeth. You're going to have to work hard for it. Yeah, I'll do it. I will surely become a great sailor. That's fine. If you succeed at that, that's all that matters. Yeah. How much longer are you going to be? I'm going to open the shoji screen. Shut up. You should take a bath once in a while. The meeting with Yamaguchi will be starting soon. You two have been here for a while now. Are you in retirement? No, no, no, no. I had someone to talk to while I was in hiding. Then again, maybe it's just naval history. Come on! Hurry up! Oh, good evening, madam. I've brought some reference books. Well, whatever. It's a good opportunity tonight. As for me, some history of our navy. Thought I could elaborate. You know, history. I'm sure the house will be delighted. Toshi. Yes. Please turn on the lights. Yes. Mother, Shin-chan hasn't finished taking a bath yet. Is that so? I need to do something first. Caps off. Command. Salutation. Song: "Umi Yukaba" Melody by: Kiyoshi Nobutoki, 1937 ♪ At sea be my corpse water-soaked ♪ ♪ On land be it with grass overgrown ♪ ♪ Let me die by the side of my Sovereign! ♪ ♪ Never will I look back ♪ The biggest surprise for me when I enlisted was the size of the marine forces. It is many, many times larger than I thought it would be. Several buildings standing side by side. This is our barracks. This is the water discharge station, this is the bathhouse, and so on. I was taught a lot of things. But was only told once. It is all so hard to remember. After the morning calisthenics, while returning to the barracks we can take a deep breath of the fresh air. And then our daily routine begins. We are the 92nd squad. The second floor of the 9th barracks is our living quarters. Norio-kun is now our instructor. Our squad leader is Lt. Yamaguchi. He's the son of the retired Yamaguchi-san that father knows. Lt. Makoto Yamaguchi. When I learned that he was my squad leader, how happy I was! Several friends have joined the squad with me. At first, Takayama was in my squad. But one day I looked around and he was gone. Except for Norio, I didn't know anyone else now. At first, I was feeling somewhat discouraged. But now, I am suddenly feeling more energetic. I thought I was really lucky. The Head Instructor of our 14th class leader is Petty Officer Suzuki. If the squad leader is the father then the Chief Instructor is the brother. I really feel like I have an older brother. He can still be gruff sometimes. But he is a really good person, very kind and gentle. From now on, with respect and trust, I am confident I will receive an education from Petty Officer Suzuki. We're all happy. Today was the first time we all did a general cleaning of the barracks. The Navy's cleanup is unlike our house cleaning. That's being polite about it. However, the Chief Instructor was more polite than I expected. The navy's love of cleanliness is more out of necessity than out of liking. Contagious diseases can spread rapidly on a small ship. It comes from a place of extreme caution. I was told by the Chief Instructor that there's no need for yelling during a general cleaning of the barracks. I see that now. It was worth the effort everyone put into it. The barracks have become so beautiful that they cannot be recognized. Our own hard work and cooperation can achieve something like this even on simple things like cleaning. I was happy about this. After the big cleaning, we were all given a bag of clothing. In it were summer and winter military uniforms properly prepared. It's easy to confuse the front and back of the uniform. You have to be careful. No one laughs at you for doing it wrong. The truth is that I almost made that mistake too. The uniforms are too big. Some people are having trouble with it such as Norio-kun. The Chief Instructor smiled and turned it around around. The Chief Instructor goes into all sorts of details. He will take care of you. The joy of trying on a sailor's uniform for the first time is like nothing else. Father, mother... I want you to see me as soon as possible. I'm finally a member of the Imperial Navy. "I'm finally a member of the Imperial Navy" he says. Wow, did you hear that? He seems to be doing well. It was really good. At that's just the first page. Yeah. There's more? Don't be in such a hurry. Let's see, the Imperial Navy... I am doing well, too. As I promised to you, father and mother, I'm sure I'll make a fine sailor. I am making my dream come true even though it goes against your wishes, dad. I'm really sorry to disobey you. Still, I am glad I volunteered. I could never be as good at your occupation as you were with your father. Well, ah... Well then, I wish both of you all the best. That's the end of it. Oh. That's strange. No, there's nothing strange about it. Really? Mr. Shosanzo, it's due to rationing. Wait. I am making my dream come true even though it goes against you wishes, dad. Still, I am glad I volunteered. I could never be as good at your occupation as you were with your father. Your father's profession is a fine one. However, I was born into a difficult time like this. As a Japanese citizen, we must be of more direct service to our country. I wanted to be a citizen who directly served my country. I'm sure your father would have felt the same way about me. I hope you understand. Though still a child, he writes about big things. This child is much like me, too. Maybe I have to think more about all this. You. That's all. I will make my dream come true even though... Well then, I wish both of you all the best. That's strange. Aren't you missing a page? No, not at all. I wish both of you all the best. I hope he will be okay. What? He's such a feeble-minded boy, alone in the faraway place. You don't know anything, do you? Don't worry about such things. He's away with friends his own age, right? You should just get used to it. You think so? I hope so. I am reassured by the fact that Yamaguchi's son is his squad leader. Yes, it is nice to know that. I'm sure Shinpachi is in good hands. Really. No matter what may happen in the future, this learning is crucial. This house... Doesn't it seem suddenly wider? Good. Good. Good. Yes. Report to the head of the 9th teaching team. That is what I was just told by the commander. I will ask again. Head of the 9th teaching team. From the 14th Teaching Team Leader Meet the 9th class leader. Just now, what the instructor just told me. I was asked to come and listen to it. Alright, that's close. But it's not "listen". Dialect is not acceptable. Kimura, you were from Miyagi Prefecture, right? Yes. It is in the Nagao district of Rikuzen. This is where Shusaku Chiba was born. Don't say anything unnecessary. What is it? Original position. Yes. Remember, no dialects. Got it, everyone? Yes. Good. I'll give a different order this time. Yooshi. Go back. You must answer first. Yes. Head of the 14th teaching team, Yamatori, has come. Alright. New order from your squad leader. For all those who joined the squad today, typhoid and smallpox injections. Gather those who have not yet had their vaccinations. Go tell them. Yes. Go to the squad leader. Among those admitted today. Cholera, or plague, injections and... Wait, what are you talking about? For all those who joined the squad today, typhoid and smallpox injections. Yes. Of those who joined the squad today. Yes, sir. Original. typhoid injection and plague No, it's not. Not plague, smallpox. Start over. Yes. Of those who joined the squad today. Who have not yet had their plague injections and vaccinations... That's still not it. I didn't say plague. Typhoid. You must really like the plague. Have you ever had the plague? Yes, ah... No, not at all. All you care about is the plague. Listen. Typhoid and smallpox injections. For all those who joined the squad today. Do you understand? Yes. For all those who have not been vaccinated. Yes, I'm in the hospital today ... I mean, of those who joined the squad today. with the plague... Of those who joined the squad today. Typhoid and smallpox injections Uh, uh. Originally. Uh, uh. Originally... Idiot, what are you jabbering about? Take your places. Yes. Yes. Everyone, treat the Emperor's rifles with respect. Understand? Yes. Hey, let's go eat. Yeah, let's go. Omayada? Yes. The bolt is open on your rifle. Yes. Idiot! What sort of marine do you expect to become? I apologize. The rifle is the soul of the marine. With that in mind, you still think you can become a Imperial Navy marine? Always tense, nervous. Why do you never listen to what I say? Come. I'm going to teach you something called the military spirit. Bow to each other. Eat. What's up? Why isn't the 14th teaching team eating? Yes. Oyamada's rifle was not taken care of properly. The head of the teaching team scolded him. Is that so? Yes. Carelessness in the way the rifle was put up. Alright. The head of the teaching team went to the school commander. Oyamada is with him. Good, I understand. Squad Leader. I am sure Oyamada was hungry. Can you please forgive him? What? Um, Oyamada is just a little forgetful. It wasn't on purpose. Idiot! You're supposed to know how to handle a rifle. Don't you know what military discipline means? It's not like when you're back home on the farm. You're not working in your family business anymore. If Oyamada is hungry, so is the leader of the teaching team. You don't understand what the Chief Instructor must do. Are you in pain? No. Then what? I, I, I... You think this is about you? Yes. That the school commander... Foolish talk! Your inattention... was because my teaching was not good enough. I'm the one responsible. Chief Instructor... That's enough. Do you understand now? You must be hungry. Go now. I had a sudden stomach ache, too. Oh, welcome back. Oh, what's that? Something fashionable. That's shallow. That's what you women are all about. Omaru. Don't be so puffed up, sit down. I have something to discuss with you. Consultation? Even though I asked for advice, I decided to do it by myself. Don't get mad at me. What's with you? You're acting weird. Don't be angry, okay? What are you talking about? I'm not getting angry. I have never disobeyed you, have I? Ever since I came to this house as a bride when I was 23. What are you saying? Isn't it so? Shinpachi has heard the story a hundred times. I thought Higashizumi-sama would be better. You said Mitake-san was better. I babysat for three days and three nights. What the hell are you talking about? After that, you made me go out in my new kimono with the high collar in back. Because you say it's fashionable. Idiot. It's nothing to do with fashion. Here. Today is different. I was going to show you this tomorrow but I'll do it now. What's this? A workman's uniform? What do you know? Shipyard. Shipyard? This is surprising. You were surprised. I was stunned. It's a big deal. It's a great thing. I've decided that I'm going to start working at the shipyard tomorrow. Ask Ken-san at the kimono shop. I've been informed of the procedures and tomorrow I'll start at the shipyard. I have decided to work for them. Is this true? Would you object if it were true? I agree with you. I agree with you very much. I learned something from Shinpachi, too. Shinpachi? What's he got to do with this? You can't hide it anymore. I found Shinpachi's letter. What? Me learn something from Shinpachi. Here it is. Huh? Where did you find it? Where you hid it. Please keep up the good work, father. I will serve my country directly. I want to be a good citizen. He's written some cheeky things. Yeah, that's my boy. Hey, he's my boy, too. But shipyard work at your age? I hope you'll be alright. Don't talk about my age. Alright? Like Shinpachi's letter said, No matter what I'm sure I can do this. Up you go then. Yes. Shiodori. Yes. Morimura. Yes. Hurry up. Your hips are wobbling. Don't look down. That's why you're afraid. Yamatori, you are being a little too easygoing. Hold on tight to the rope. Hey, Morimura, what's going on? What are you doing? Stand firm on your feet. Why are you not moving? Don't look down. Looking down makes you scared. That's not how to do it. Morimura, if this were a real ship when you sway down together, you sway up together. What good are you just clinging to the mast? Don't look down. Morimura, step up. What's wrong? This is pathetic. What are you going to do? Ei. Hey, you. Ei. Hey, you. Ei. Hey, you. Out. Hey, you. In. Hey, you. Out. Hey, you. In. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. Stop. Listen up. What if the sailors of Japan, a maritime nation, cannot swim? You must learn to swim as soon as possible. Everyone must do their best. Okay? Yes. Hayase, do have any postcards left? One sheet. Oh, someone dropped something. Who was it? Me. Hey, where is it? Where is it? Oh, there it is, there it is. What is it? Oh, good. Hey, what is it? Let me see it. I don't want to. I'll show you when I become great. Hey, Morimura. What? Come and see. Someone more pathetic than you. You're still better than that one. Oh, no, no, no. Why are you making yourself such a spectacle? The bar. Look up. Don't look down. Hey, there. Morimura, loosen up. If you hold it so tightly, your stroke won't flow. Kaitate. Yamatori, swap positions with Ayase. Yes. What now? Everyone, help Yamatori. Yes. Here, Yamatori, grab the oar. Grab on to the oar. Hang on tight. Here, Yamatori. Yamatori will do his best, Chief Instructor. Idiot, why did you let go? There you go, grab it. Chief Instructor, Yamatori swims. What the hell are you doing? You'll catch a cold with all this fooling around. Here, grab on to the oar now. Chief Instructor, I can swim. I can swim. It was crazy. Wasn't it cold? It was cold, wasn't it? I don't remember anything. But because I fell carelessly, I'm sure the Chief Instructor is angry. Yeah, probably. But you found it you can swim. Uh-huh. After all that, I could swim. Yamatori, Ryozo. A circle for swimming. Yeah, that's my squad. No more non-swimmers left. Oh, really? Didn't Yamatori fall in? Yes, but he swam. Hmm, I see. That's great. Okay. Yeah. At last, he swam. Yamatori swam? Yeah. Suzuki, it's a promise. Yes. Yes, it is. Hey, what's going on? What is this? Until the grades of my class improve. I promise I won't smoke. I got my wish yesterday. You can smoke now. No, no, no. I still don't smoke. Some in my squad still can't do flags or masts. Maybe when we win the cutter rowing. Hey, don't let your head get too big. Until I get the best bayonet class score. Well, here we are. Like I said, I don't smoke. Come on, don't be modest. This is big. It won't come true if you say it out loud. Associate Instructor. Where are you going? Well, I can't sit still any longer. There are still three people in my squad who can't swim. Iizuka. Yes. Onodera. Yes. Sakuma. Yes. Come with me. Your father's letter didn't give us any details. In any case, the people in your neighborhood have known you since you were little. said your father told them you had a weak heart. He just didn't know if you could be a good sailor. Your father's letter... ...was not reassuring. I can tell you are no weakling. Please don't worry unnecessarily. About this letter. What do you think about what I just told you? Your father cares about you. He is very proud. You're doing your best for the navy. I'm sorry I can't write to your parents. But I will tell him so the next time I go to the shipyard. My father is not running the family business any more? Correct. Make yourself a good work warrior. Morimura. Are you embarrassed by your father? Ask yourself. Are you being too hard on him? Chief Instructor, how are Morimura's grades? Well, in fact... Morimura, It's not good if the Cheif Instructor doesn't agree immediately. It's okay for now. I'm not qualified to say otherwise. Do you understand? Yes. Good. That's all for today. Do your best. Yes. Morimura, leaving. Chief Instructor. Yes. Keep your spirits up and do your best. Yes. Even though he's the squad leader's acquaintance's child, Don't let that sway you. Yes. I will. When piloting a Seihaku-class patrol boat, what is the maximum speed at which... Owada. Yes. Can you read silently? Yes. I was able to finish it. Yooshi. Hey, Yamatori. What's wrong? Don't you feel well I have a headache. Maybe it's a fever. Let me check. I think it's possible. Chief Instructor, I have a question. What is it? If the platoon is charging, what is the distance between the troops? It depends on the terrain, but usually 50 meters. Understand? Yes. Anyone know where Morimura is? Yes. He left. He said he was going to the training grounds. Training grounds? Good. Class rescheduled -Squad Leader Yamatori. Yes. Quiet, quiet. I'm out of practice. Yeah, I'm not feeling very well. Oh, well. If you get bored with my singing. Chief Petty Officer Suzuki will play the violin later. Maybe you've heard this one. It's about tea. Song: "Ishimatsu konpira daisan" Lyrics: Hirosawa Torazo ♪ Akihaji and ♪ ♪ Hanachibana too ♪ ♪ are scented with tea ♪ ♪ The clear flow of the Ota River ♪ ♪ It's time for young sweetfish to dance ♪ ♪ Even the green and color of the pine ♪ ♪ Enshu Morimachi, the source of good tea ♪ ♪ My daughter went tea picking ♪ ♪ Here is the famous fire-fighting god ♪ What? The older sister of Ryozo Yamatori is visiting. Yamatori's sister? Yes. The new recruit's visitation hasn't been approved. She requests to meet with the Chief Instructor of his teaching team. End message. Okay, I'll meet her. You say you are the elder sister of Yamatori? Yes. I am Petty Officer Suzuki of the 14th Instructional Group. I am the elder sister of Ryozo Yamatori. My brother is in your care. Thank you for coming all this way. I'm sure you must be busy. Not really. So what is it? I have traveled here from our hometown. The hometown is Morioka, isn't it? Yes. Well, you're a long way from home. Is there something I can help you with? I just came to give something to my brother. I did not mean to cause trouble. Actually, my father has just been enshrined at Yasukuni Shrine. Oh, I see. You must be honored. Yamatori hasn't said anything. I was aware of your father's service. Huh? A survey of each recruit's background is performed. It is used as an educational reference. And so you are now the sole keeper of the family house. I know this. Mother would always say to Ryozo. You can meet your father at Yasukuni Shrine next time. Even my deceased mother wanted to give him a glimpse of his father with the soil from my mother's grave. This is the soil. I would like you to give this to my brother. In it are his father and mother. I want you to tell him so. When he gets on a ship and goes to the front line, wrap it around your stomach. I always thought that my father and mother would go together. Work as hard as you can. Don't worry about the house. She said, "Even my sister can plow that much rice by herself". That's what my mother said. I understand. I understand. I shall give this to him. Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask you to do that. Well, I'll leave you to it. I see. According to the rules, I regret that you are unable to see your brother. It's alright. Thank you for everything. Of course. Yamatori is doing well. Rest assured. Yes. Yes. Yamatori. How are you? Ah, Chief Instructor. Yes, doing much better. Good. Looks like no more fever. Yes, I'm fine now. Chief Instructor. I can get up now. Oh, no, no, no. Sleep all day. The other recruits were asking about me. And I don't feel like sleeping. They said I looked fine. They were here? Yes, they just left. Good. Yamatori, as your Chief Instructor, I met your sister. My sister? She came to see me. What do you mean? Why? Not about your father. I don't think you've told anyone. Yes. My father was killed in battle. I'm not the only one. Yeah, that's right. You're the one who's going to avenge your father's death. Yes, I believe so. With that in mind, I volunteered for the Navy. Yes, do your best. Yes. Yamatori. This is soil from your mother's grave. Huh? This was what your sister brought to me to give to you. In it, are your father and mother. Wrap it around your stomach when you go off to war. You'll always have your mom and dad with you. Think of it that way, and work as hard as you can. That's what your sister said. Yes. She said not to worry about the house. Your sister said so and left. My sister left? Yeah, she left already. Did you want to meet? No, I can't. Right, because it's a rule. New recruits are not allowed visits. Still, it's nice to think about even if we didn't meet. Like a dream. Yeah, that's the spirit. Keep up the good work with that mindset, young man. Your father and your mother are watching you. Yes. What is it, Morimura? Yes. Everyone is waiting for the violin performance by the Chief Instructor of the teaching team. Okay, good. Yamatori, do your best. Ah, yes. I will now play "Umi Yukaba". Everyone, correct your posture. Other than that, nothing to worry about. Fight hard. Boldness and courage of fighting spirit will carry the day. Alright, got it? Yes. When the day comes that you graduate and leave this school. You will sing this song on the blackboard at the gate. Got it? Yes. Proceed resolutely to your place of assignment. A long time ago. Before the current war, from the Tenpyo era, to the soldiers of today. In that spirit, nothing has changed. You will be saying goodbye to your immediate family with the same feeling. You've been away from home to learn. And now, as a noble and honorable marine. Listen up. Yes. You are no longer your parent's troublesome child. You will be marines of the Imperial Navy. Although that may seem frightening, each of you is in total command of himself and a shield for His Majesty. Act so. But you are not yet full-fledged marines just yet. From here, you receive basic training to become a marine. There is nothing else like the marines. So, how should we all be motivated? You cannot become a good soldier otherwise. You know what I'm talking about? Yes. I myself am this chosen shield. Always keep that in mind. Hazardous duties are inevitable. Understand? Yes. Well then, this is the end of my lecture time today. Finally, this personal matter. This is my final day instructing you. And as your squad leader. I have my orders and will leave for sea duty as of today. It was decided that I would take a certain job. I've gotten to know you young men so well. It is with great regret that I leave you in mid-education. From tomorrow on, Dai Kawahara, whom I respect, Dai Kawahara. You all know him? Yes. Dai Kawahara will replace me. The navy asked me to guide you. There is nothing to worry about. Listen carefully to the Chief Instructor of the teaching team. Do you hear me? Yes. Good. With time and effort, I eagerly hope that each of you will become a fine marine. That is all. Correct your posture. Salutation. Squad Leader. Congratulations! Congratulations! Finally, it's time for battle. Maybe. We'll see what the future holds. Yes. Yes. I'll be sure to let you know. This is the squad roster. This is the grade sheet. Thank you very much for your support. In addition, here are the details for the change of command. You will hear from the head of each teaching team. Okay, thanks. I hope you are well too. 92nd Squad Commander Navy Captain Toyohiko Kono I have made tea. Thank you. I want to keep these letters. I guess it will pass for poetry. You have done a fine job. To Tomisaki-san, the big one. Please give this to the sailor when he comes. Yes. Let's have another one. Yes. You. What, you've changed? I wish you the best of luck. You're acting funny again. Sailors board ships. It's nothing unusual. Yes.

Come to the Tsujido exercise next time. It had been a long time since I slept on tatami. We are working harder and harder. At the end of the month, I went to field training. After that, it will be time to graduate. Before that, we will visit the battleship Mikasa in Yokosuka on the 25th. We may be able to meet you there. During the Battle of the Sea of Japan in 1905, this is the warship that Admiral Togo sailed on. I am looking forward to it. Oh, that looks like Shin-chan. What, Shinpachi? There, see. There. There you go. There he is. There, there, there. There, there. Oh, there he is. There he is. Yeah. Shinpachi! Oh, uncle no. This way. Father. Dad, I'm up here. Well, dad, you were just stomping all over the place. Oh, okay. Here we go. Yes. 30 degrees port. Enemy warships. Stand-by. Fire! Well, I'll have to let everyone know about this. Yes. All hands of Squad 92 assemble on the foredeck. All hands of Squad 92 assemble on the foredeck. All hands of Squad 92 assemble on the foredeck. From one of our destroyer squadrons in the western Pacific. In a night raid on an enemy base, one enemy battleship, two cruisers, and other auxiliaries were sunk or damaged. Moreover, who do you think was the commander of that destroyer squadron? It was your former squad leader, Lt. Yamaguchi. That's exactly what Lt. Yamaguchi is doing, literally, destroying the enemy by deadly onslaught. This is a great achievement by your squad leader. Remember this day deeply in the pit of your stomach. Alright? Yes. Good. Today is the last day of your shipboard training. You will then graduate as sailors. The day will soon come when you will be useful at sea. You were under Lieutenant Yamaguchi. Respond to the feat of your squad commander. Are you ready for this? Are you ready? Tonight I'll celebrate and have a cigarette. A light. Hey, Unata, are you asleep yet? No, I can't sleep. You too, huh. I can't help it. If you keep talking, you'll lose even more sleep. What, you're awake too? Obviously. There's something wrong with someone who can't fall sleep right away. Look at Yamatori. Sleeping soundly like a cow. Yamatori is different. I'm not sleeping. Oh. I'm awake. So, even you can't sleep tonight. What do you mean "even you"? I have many nights when I don't sleep well. Huh? I wonder if cows have bad nights when they can't fall asleep. Yamatori, you're awake. Yes. No, fast asleep. Idiot, a sleeping person would not reply. What? Everyone's awake? Yes. Yes. No, no, no. Everyone go to sleep. I'm going to sleep. There's an all-hands assembly tomorrow. It's the end of your training. Now, I must get some sleep and get my strength back. After you heard about that great battle. That it was your squad leader. Hearing of Lt. Yamaguchi's distinguished service... maybe it's no wonder I can't sleep. But soon you will too. Achieve a distinguished deed like squad commander Yamaguchi. That is how you can repay your squad leader. Alright? Yes. Tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, you will leave this place. As you take a step outside the gates, battleships, cruisers, or destroyers are waiting for you. The decisive battle at sea awaits. That's all I can think about right now. As a respected, full-fledged sailor exit this gate. That's the first thing you need to do. Understand? Yes. Morimura, you got it? Yes. Ishiguro. Yes. Understand? Yes. Alright then, everyone get to sleep. Sleep soundly and well. Yes. It's been a long time but your diligent study has borne fruit. I am happy to say that you are now marines. The fact that you have completed your training is proof that each of you is truly a golden nugget of this profession. The Greater East Asian War is now. There will soon be the decisive battle. You, having been taught by masters, will use this knowledge to its fullest. It is coming soon. From now on, on of your shoulders will rest the great responsibility of the Japanese Navy. Don't forget what you've learned and put it to use with the marines. Pursuing the traditions of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Keep it firmly in your mind and calmly go about your duties. Crossing the waves of the South Sea, guided by the morals of the Diet. Good luck, confident in the ultimate victory in this holy war, to complete the objective to do your utmost to serve the Emperor with sincerity. And now, finally. I wish you all the best of luck in your endeavors. I wish you long military fortune. That is all. Forward, now.
