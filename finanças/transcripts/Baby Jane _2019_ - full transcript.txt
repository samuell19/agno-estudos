Mom: "Are you OK?" Fuck off! You coming? Anything else? I live there. You too? What would you want to do with me? Like what? Like... Share a milkshake with two straws? And the amusement park? I'll take you. The zoo? -Oh yes, the zoo. I used to work there, briefly. -Really? Nice place. Lots of animals. No people. What else? The forest. The jetty. And Lapland. Sounds good. And a walk in freshly fallen snow. Yes. Our footprints on the snow side by side. Can't do the rollercoaster, though. -Even if I got you two cotton candies? Let me help. -No, no. You smell like forest. Hey! At last! Here she comes. Sorry we're late. This is Jonna. Thanks. Jonna. Eero. Leva. Tema. And Stuba gave you the lilac. That's Bossa. I'll be right back. A real Baby Jane. Fuck! I'll lick it up. Bottoms up. -Bottoms up! Bottoms up indeed. Howdy. Lovely evening. Piki's got booze. If you wanna hear more about my business... Sorry. Why are you spooked all the time? Don't be. I just am that way. You don't have to be scared. I'm here now. But not always. Hey, any beer left? -We ran out. I'll go get some. I'll come with you. No... You don't have to go. Or you go? I'll go. Helsinki Pride a Success Where did you get this? -From Bossa. When you were together? Yeah. Why isn't it in the box? Must've forgotten to put it there. F-41? Yeah. What does it mean? Panic disorder. Basic stuff. I just can't do everything, go every place. Nothing peculiar. How long have you had it? -Ten years. About. Think it's just fine to snoop on me? You got something to hide? -Doesn't everyone? No. It's okay. But you could have told me. I didn't want to. I have lots of friends with depression. Nothing to be ashamed of. Good. Are you okay? No, I want to die. Silly. Happy Midsummer! Cheers. - Cheers. There's eggs, lettuce, bread... -Good meal. I'm never going there again. -Grumpy-face. Show me again how you'd give them a blowjob. I told you I've never done it! -Sure you have. Yeah, in garages and the school bathroom. Libraries and forests. Under bridges and in a park playhouse. Everywhere. Show me. Go for it. My girl was a real hotlips! Famous. Know what? We could make a nice bit of money out of it. They're looking for taxi drivers. Do you have a driver's license? -No. Have you applied to schools? -Yeah. The city's full of people like you, y'know. Wait, here's something. Why are you wearing that fucking jumpsuit? I was at work. Honey, I didn't know it's like that. They're gonna cut off my phone, like today. You will never have to wear that again. Go home, take a shower, burn those rags and come back. I have an idea. I'll get us private phone clients. And enough money to get by. 15 minutes, 100 euros, for just talking. No live appearances. Belle de Jour. Hooker for the fun of it. Too good to do real work, good enough at selling herself. Burn those overalls. You have been accepted as a student at the University of Helsinki. Arch your back. Just like that. That's good. Yes! Move that way. Like... there. Looking good. Susanna. Hi. I'm not wearing anything. All I have is this... This buzzing rod. What do you want me to do with it? Ah, not there, too tight. I want to smell you. Could you send me some of your smell? Like panties or something? I'll pay you. OK. Can I have your address? My voice, your scent. Okay? 25-year-old student waiting in her wet panties to send them especially to you. Perfect. Susanna... Hi. Big boy. Susanna. A virgin? Of course. I don't know. Maybe. I'm so wet. Worn, nude older-woman panties with strong scent. There. Here we go. Perfect. Turn around. Yeah, here too. It didn't rain yesterday. How are you doing? Morning. A few parcels to send? Honey? Couldn't we afford a trip somewhere? Yeah, but who'd look after the clients? If they can't get hold of Susanna they'll find someone else. You see? Yeah. Piki calling. So, dear future teachers... I also have a present for you. Goes well with that dress. -It's beautiful. Thank you. It's important to me that you are safe. It's important to me that I get to take care of you. They must have great sex. What are you talking about? -Sex. Should I take the garbage out? -Yeah. What kind of women does Bossa like? -How come? Are you, like, her type? -I guess so. But she's not your type? -No way. Surely you know- I like women who look like women. Why did your relationship end? Is this somehow relevant? -Bossa didn't want it to end? No. But it did. And a friendship began. Anything else? Hey. I've taught her everything she knows. Why would I be interested in her? Remember to pay for your date. Remember to brush your teeth. Open the door, carry the bags. And always get stuff for breakfast in case the girl spends the night over. You never go out with me. Why would I? You do it for me. Couldn't you at least fucking once come with me? I don't like being out. -Except when you're drunk. You know it isn't my fault. Still. Just for a change. -Let it be. You don't give a shit about me. -Not true. You don't give a shit about anything! Hey. Jonna! Hi. I need something. What's so special about her? Nothing. Just that. She's normal. Are you going to start therapy again? Social Services pulled the plug last spring. What do you want to eat tomorrow? -Dunno. Any suggestions? I decide. Sorry I yelled at you. I want you. I want a home and a family with you. And a baby called Bob. Bob? I want you. It's beautiful. It was my mom's. -Really? I could really use a beer. I wanna go for a walk with you. Like to the shore. We'll get sundaes. Spend the whole day. Wander around in the cemetery and give nuts to squirrels. They'll eat out of our hands. Wife. Wearing nothing but a ring? Cost 60 euros. I got it from the market hall. Bossa stopped by. -Yeah. She has keys to your place? -Yes. Why does Bossa have keys to your place? -I gave them to her way back when. And you never asked her to give them back? -No. It's good to keep a spare set with someone who lives close-by. How close does she live? Across the square and the next street. Convenient. -Yeah. Why doesn't she call before coming over? -She does. Couldn't she at least knock? -She could. Why does Bossa do your laundry? -What the fuck do you care? Your clothes are all crumpled up again. Why don't you bring a spare set of clothes here,- something comfortable. We can empty out one of the shelves in the closet,- and I can throw the spare set into the laundry for Bossa to wash. Could I take the garbage out? -No. Let me take your garbage out. -Let it be. The amusement park closed for the winter yesterday. Yeah? It's half a kilometer away from your flat. -So what? That bicycle of yours in the attic, do you like riding it? Haven't done much biking lately. Marianne and I used to go for rides together. Did you drive around in that car of yours with Marianne? I don't have the car anymore. Marianne and I broke up ten years ago. What does it matter what Marianne and I used to do? And the girl who came after Marianne? What did you used to do with her? Things people do. Shopping, taking the bus, driving around. -Exactly. Things like that. And Bossa? What did you and she used to do? What is your problem? -What is my problem? In Panic Yeah? I feel bad. Come here. No. I'm having a good time, so give it a fucking break! N 31... B 11... I'm not scared of dying anymore. Everything'll turn out alright if you just love enough. Right? Come all over me. Come on, come on. Yeah. In my mouth. Come on, come on. Did you come? It's Midsummer's Eve and it smells of birch. I beat you with a birch brush. You're wearing those shoes and you're making them suffer. They've been bad. Very bad. What do you wanna do to me there? Hi. You can take my garbage out. If you want. Hi, I'm here. Why? Why not now? What are all these games? What right do you have? You can't even take your own garbage out! Stop shouting. What are you doing? -Who'd take Bob to see a doctor? Please stop. -If I was sick? I would, of course. -"Of course"? If it was an emergency I certainly would. -I'm not up to taking the baby out alone. You won't have to. -So who'd do it then? Bossa? Bossa would come to check-ups with me? Bossa would be there when I give birth? I don't want Bossa there! I can't stand Bossa! I don't like it that she knows everything about what we do in bed. She doesn't. She does your laundry, of course she knows! It disgusts me that she knows what my hair and skin smells like. That she knows when my period has started in your bed,- and when you've been eating yogurt out of my navel or cookies out of my ass. It disgusts me! -Hey. You're starting to sound a bit sick. What's sick is that Bossa came up with the only way to keep you- for herself after you dumped her. She hit you in the weak spot. And did a good job. How can a woman who looks so stupid be so clever? She looks like some harmless fucking bath sponge- but she's the nastiest piece of works I've ever seen! With every trip to the shop, to fetch you ice-cream,- to return your bottles, to stop by the pharmacy,- she turned you more and more into her prisoner. That's sick! Nothing happens in your life without her knowing and that's sick, too! Admit it! Not the records. -I'll kill your records. Psycho. Bossa is sick. -Bossa is normal. Hi. -A cider, please. I'm sorry. I'll never yell at you like that. -I'm sorry. I know being with me can be sheer hell. I was just so mad. Love you. -Love you too. What are...? What are those? Who? -Nobody. Tell me everything. Tell me everything. How did a cock feel? Fucking hetero! Damn it! Is it true that balls make this flapping sound against your ass? You're not going anywhere! Give me that ring! Was it your mother's ring? Or did your whore go and buy it? I'm the bad one here?! Fuck! Hi, it's Bossa. Piki's in the hospital. Nerves cut off in her right hand. The tips of her fingers have lost all the feeling. Piki doesn't want to see you or hear from you anymore. You coming? No, I'm not going in until half past. -OK. Bye. -Bye. I find the old-fashioned bipartite viewpoint somewhat conservative... We need to create a more faceted... Joonatan, hi! Saw your presentation, it was great. Thanks. This is Jonna. Eero. Hi. -Hi. Sari. -Hi. Jonna. Enjoy your evening. -You too. Are they together, those two? -Well, yeah. They're married. How long? -Fifteen years. Are they happy? -Eero and his wife? I guess so. Last time I visited he sent all the guests home early- so he'd get to have sex with her before going to sleep. Is that a sign of being happy? Hey. At least the two of us are happy. Right? Hello? Hi. Wanna go out drinking? Or does a hetero have her master's rules? Wait. You been renovating? -Yeah. And I'm off the pills. I wanted to see what the world looks like without pills. So what does it look like? -The same. I guess. I haven't been going out. And I've got that rag on the window so how would I know. But don't just stand there. Sit. Have a drink. So... How's Susanna? I just couldn't... Couldn't deal with it anymore. I've been trying to sleep as much as possible. Sleep, sleep. Haven't been to a bar in like a hundred years. Wouldn't know what to do there. I've got nothing to say. Really, you? Why didn't you call me before? I called you now. It's OK. I'm here now. I won't leave again. I made a couple of appointments for you. -I won't do it. I got them to agree to give you a full doctor's examination. They should have done it in the first place, instead of stuffing pills in your face. Got no money. -I'll pay. You? Or your man? Who cares? I'll pay. Okay. -What've you got to lose? I said okay. Okay. -Okay. Morning. You didn't go. Didn't get around to it. Are you angry? Don't you ever get tired of watching that? It's actually Bossa's favorite movie. Not mine. Have you found a new woman whose sheets Bossa gets to wash? Any business of yours? Are you interested? Want to know what she smells like? What she tastes like? At least she tastes better than a cock. Tell me, how can you keep a straight face when you see an erect cock? How can you talk to me like that? How should I talk to you then? Like I do to the clients? You're not my client, you're my bank. We were engaged. I picked you because you lived conveniently nearby. I want a woman I can send home at night without cab fares,- and ask her to come over if I feel like having sex. It's cheaper that way. Piki? I have no life. This is so fucking pointless. Don't talk like that. -You mean tell it like it is? Well, it is. Would at least consider those walks? I'm 34 years old- and I stopped living years ago. In nearly all cases the symptoms ease up after a person turns 35. You're... -An adult infant. An immature senior. I haven't seen sunlight in years. Or when I was in therapy- I'd occasionally catch a glimpse of the sun. I'd sometimes stay sitting in the park for a while and read a book. There was this second-hand bookstore around the corner. I'd go there and buy a paperback and go to the park to read. I miss the smell of a bookstore. But more than anything I miss those moments- when it's minus twenty degrees outside- and the snow creaks under your shoes. Like it does when it's freezing cold. But now I lie here every evening thinking- about what the best way would be. If I swallowed every pill I could find. Jonna. Listen. Concentrate. I wish you'd come. The Mediterranean would do you good. I'm doing good enough here. But thank you for the thought. Anyway. His wife told me. For six months, every morning,- he went to work same as always. And he came home at the usual hour. Wonder what he did with all that time in between? Took baths. -What? He'd sneak back home and spend the whole day- sitting in the bathtub, letting the water touch him like a secret lover... Yeah well, maybe Ulf took baths. Who knows. Know what we would have done if we'd still had time? What? -I'm not telling you, fucking coward. Wash your glass and put it in the cabinet. Don't look so devastated. No reason for it. Remember the letter. Thank you. Go now. I couldn't do it. It's snowing. Okay. You have such a beautiful mouth. You could make a lot of money with that mouth. Show me how you suck cock. It's yours. Hello? You mean this letter? The recipient confirms it. Bossa. She found the body and notified us. That was quite a stunt you pulled there. The will through the mail slot. Piki loves her records. Can you tell me, what happened that night? I brought the supplies. And I... You taped the bag around her head? Piki herself... You tied her hands? No, I didn't. She tied her hands behind her back herself? What are you talking about? Fortunate thing, that letter. Otherwise you wouldn't be leaving this place in a long time. In light of this evidence, the investigation will proceed- with no suspicion of foul play. Assisting with suicide is not a crime. It's always a selfish act. Yeah. It was you? Yeah.
