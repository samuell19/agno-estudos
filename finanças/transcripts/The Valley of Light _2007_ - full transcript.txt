We heard you were awarded a Purple Heart. Your mama and daddy would have been real proud. Thank you, sir. (dog barking) Mama. Can I help you? No, ma'am. This was my home before the war. You're one of the Locke family? Yes, ma'am. We're farming this land now. I understand. Sorry for the interruption. Locke, you got a visitor. I was just driving the car. I didn't even have a gun. You don't understand how hard it was with Mama sick. I had to get out. I couldn't breathe. They said I could go to Mama's funeral, but I'd have to be in chains, and I couldn't do that to her. MAN: No, sir. No contact with the prisoner. Time's up, Locke. You... disown me, Noah? You're the only family I got, Travis. My brother's 17, Mr. Gates. Shouldn't there be some leniency? No, sir. Not a chance. Travis is a good boy. He just made a bad decision, and I wasn't here to help him. I'm sorry about your kid brother. We thank you for your service over there. Thank you, Mr. Gates. If I were you, I'd focus on what I was going to do now that this war is over. Yes, sir. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ It's like water everywhere else, boy. It's wet. You feeling for life in that river? It's just an old habit. I didn't mean to spook you. You got that look about you. Man that's ready to duck down. I'd say you was in the war. Was you? Yeah, I was. Fishing's best from the bend. Help yourself to the worms. Thanks. I saw you coming a long way off. You had company. I saw a man and a woman walking beside you. That wasn't me, sir. I'm alone here. It was you. Man was lame. Woman was awfully pretty. Petite little lady. Sounds like you're describing my folks. But they died. Aw. That's awfully sad. Look, look, you got you one. (chuckles) (sighs) You say you see my folks? How's that? It's just a gift that come to me. Five years ago. Seeing the other side. Well, I don't believe in ghosts. Neither do I. Only angels. (fishing reel whirring) Oh, would you look at that. Thank you. (sighs) Mm. You just wandering around... ...or you going somewhere? I guess I'm wandering. Just looking for a sign that tells me to stop. But you're just walking willy-nilly. You ought to go over to those mountains there. Just over the ridge, there's a nice little valley. Born and raised there. Awfully nice people. Good fishing, too. There's a little lake over there. The locals call it The Lake of No Fish. Boy, it's got the biggest bass you ever saw. I hooked him once. Fought me like the devil. You got to take your time with him. You got to aggravate him some. Yeah, yeah, I've seen fish like that. Yeah. Must be as big as Jonah's whale by now. Well, I guess I best be getting home. Thank you for your hospitality, Noah Locke. You said you seen my folks-- my ma, my pa? You still see 'em? Bright as day. And there are others, too. Your army buddies. You don't want to lose them, either. What you want to lose... is that cloak of grief about your shoulders. You did your best to save 'em. You go on over to that valley. Try to catch my fish.

Looks like we got us a wandering sheep. Where you from? Asheville. I had a cousin lived there. Name of Wally Mayfield. You know him? No, sir. You didn't miss much. ( all chuckling ) You serve in the war? I did. Europe or the Pacific? Europe. What outfit? 42nd Infantry. (clears throat) Whitlow Mayfield. When I'm not walking behind a plow, I'm the sheriff of this county. Marshall, here, is my deputy. Pleasure. Howdy. Howard Reynolds. This here is Matthew. My name's Noah Locke. What you doing with yourself these days, Noah Locke? I pick up an odd job here and there, but mostly I do me some fishing. Fishing? Well, if you come for the fishing contest, friend, I'm afraid you're a bit early. I don't know nothing about no fishing contest. We have a fishing contest here in about two weeks. Cost two dollars to get in. Draws a crowd, and we wind up with a little money for the school. You you could walk away with $20. Give Littleberry some competition. Yeah. That would be Littleberry Davis. He's won our contest the last... ooh, five, six years in a row by my count. Six. Six. You a fisherman, tell you what. You go down to that river there, and catch me a mess of them river cats before sundown, I'll give you a dime for every fish big enough to fry. My boy likes catfish. Don't let him bait you, friend. You not knowing the river this time of day, I'd say you'd be wasting your time. Oh, I'll do it. All right, to get to our house, take that road there past the meadow till you see a little gray house. Yes, sir. Thank you. Well, been here five minutes, already you got you some business. Yeah. And... that is four. Oh, you got a smorgasbord there. (laughs) Ma'am. Taylor? Uh-huh. We captured us here a Noah Locke, traveling fisherman, if you can believe that. Is that so? Marjorie, you take care. I will. This is my cousin, Taylor Bowers, and if he don't have what you want, he'll just go ahead and try to sell you something else. Some folks are born-again Christians; Taylor, here, is a born-again talker. Worse than I am. And that's going some. How can I help you? What you need, son? Some sardines? Some canned tuna? That would put a hole in your fishing story. Well, yes, it would. I'll just have a bag of coffee, a soap bar, and a shirt, if you got it. Will chambray do? That would be fine, thanks. Eleanor. Taylor. Whitlow. Afternoon, Eleanor. Anything I can get for you? Oh, I know where everything is. All right, then. Now, don't you go raising prices on our friend here. He was an army man, like my boy. You know you're the only one I cheat around here, cousin. Nice to meet you, sir. Same here. You really make a living fishing? Well, now, that depends on what you call a living. I eat a lot of fish. (laughing) You know of any jobs around town? I got one right here. You see those two fools yakking over there? They're supposed to be painting this store. You witness even one foot of pine board painted out there when you walked up? Coffee's right behind you. Eleanor, are you finding everything all right? Well, now, what is that? What is that there in your ear? Well, now, look at that-- a nickel. You want some candy? Yes. Chocolate? I can wait my turn. Oh, no, no, that's fine. Please, go ahead. This is Noah Locke. I got it right, didn't I? You did. And this is Eleanor Chatwin. He's taking orders if you got a taste for catfish. Oh, no, thank you. We don't eat much fish. Oh, well. You take care of yourself. Thanks. That's a fine woman. All righty. This is a dollar fifty. And a, uh, nickel's worth of penny candy for my friend here. Hey, there, Matthew. Well, let's see. What do you think? Orange slices today, or Boston Beans, or...? Hmm? Jelly beans. WOMAN: I'm coming, Matthew. You must be the fish seller. Yes, ma'am. My name's Noah Locke. I'm Ada Reynolds. Matthew told me he met a new friend today. HOWARD: Look at that. (whistles) Where did you catch 'em? River? Yes, sir. This time of day? That makes these miracle fish. Just the right size for pan frying, too. Give them here, and I'll start supper. Why don't you tell Mr. Noah to come to church with us on Sunday? Here. How long you staying? Don't know, sir. Come to church on Sunday. It's the only one in the valley. Church of the Resurrected Christ. No matter how you were raised, everybody's welcome. Thank you, sir. Come on, Matthew.

Is that loud enough, Granny? Yeah. I hear it. Every week, I receive letters from listeners who say, "I must not be a good Christian. "For, surely, if I were firmly rooted in faith..." (cow lowing) (lowing) You got some trouble there? You're that fisherman? Yes, ma'am. You mind if I have a look? (lowing) I know. Shh. (cow moos weakly) You got a rifle? She needs to be shot? (cow grunts) Yes, ma'am. You want some meat from it, I can butcher it for you. All right. (cow moos weakly) (cow grunts) (gunshot) (birds chirping) I brought you dinner. Oh, there's no need. If you don't, I'll feel even worse, waylaying you on your way to church. Oh, I wasn't going nowhere. Just thinking about it. Thank you. (sighs) Shouldn't have been a surprise, her dying. She was awfully old. Still, it shook me. You were in the war? Yeah, I was. My late husband, Boyd, was, too. I'm sorry to hear that. What was it like? The war. Well, it's not something you can get out of your mind. And there's no making sense of it, either. I guess a lot of things... don't make sense. Thank you for your help. Please, just a few bites. I want my chocolate. (knock at door) I thought you'd left. I went out an hour ago, and you were gone. I just went to the pump to wash up. Who's that? Forgive my manners. You'd think I didn't have any. Come in, Mr. Locke. Meet Boyd's grandmother, Mrs. Beatrice Chatwin. Ma'am. Granny isn't feeling all that well today. She won't give me my chocolate. (laughs softly) Granny lives on chocolate bars. Maybe I ought to write the candy company and give them a testimonial. Well, it's getting dark. I'll drive you home. Oh, there's no need; my camp's not far. Where are you? I'm up the road at the lake. The fishing cabin? Uh, no, ma'am, just near it. Well, why don't you use it? Well, I... I didn't know who to ask. You ask me. I'll be back shortly, Granny. Ma'am. (sighs) My husband shot himself here. Not in the cabin. If that's any difference to you. I thought he died in the war. Boyd came home without a scratch on him. But he was changed. Now, why would he do that, Mr. Locke? Why would a man go through a war and come home and kill himself? (floorboards creaking) Use it. Boyd use to come here and stay the night, just to be by himself. I think everything's here. Lamp, cot. A man named Arch Wheeler built this cabin. He died right there in that chair. Boyd said he used to come up here and drink with Arch's ghost. He was always trying to scare me. But people say this place is haunted. Yeah, you hear stories-- lights on the water, hunting dogs whimpering like they've seen a ghost. Eh... I'm a chatterbox, aren't I? I don't think Granny says a dozen words in a week. Makes me too hungry for talk. Good night. Good night, ma'am. Thank you. For what? I'm trying to thank you for taking care of my poor cow. So don't thank me. How old are you, Mr. Locke? I'm 28. Well, I'm just four years older, so... don't call me "ma'am." Yes, ma'am. All right... I won't say it-- on a trade. You don't call me "mister." All right... Noah. Well, you see any ghosts, you holler. (engine starts) (birds squawking in distance) NOAH: Dear Travis... since I last wrote you, I've come to a place called the Valley of Light. A fisherman by the name of Hoke Moore sent me here. He claims that the biggest bass he's ever seen lives in this lake, and I know now... that's no fish tale. Well, morning, fish seller. Morning. Just come by wondering if you still need somebody to do some painting? You bet! Just look at this place. I'll pay $20 for the whole job. I'll supply the sandpaper and paint. Oh, yes, sir, that's a deal. All right. Lookie here. Now, you get a fish order, you go fish. Paint when you can. Yes, sir. You're gonna be good for business. Howard was bragging at church about all those catfish you caught him. Howard's son, that boy... Matthew. That's Howard's grandson. But he and Ada keep him. Boy's mama passed away quite a few years ago. Matthew's daddy hasn't been around since. They say he's working in Tennessee. He sends that boy money, but we never see him. He ever talk? 'Cause, uh, his grandma said that, uh, he talks to her. Ada says she hears him with her heart. (laughs): She does, that's a fact. But that boy... never spoke a word. What the hay, Taylor? You giving our jobs away? He's the fisherman Howard's talking about. That so? Name's Noah Locke. Peavo Teasley. Moody Goodhouse... the Third. Pleasure meeting you boys. TAYLOR: People are gonna come around to get a look at this man while he's working. Did you hear that word? "Working"? That'd be a... foreign tongue to you boys? I'm digging for bait. Want to help? Hey, look at this. I saw a flock of robins here. That's how I knew to look for earthworms. Now, after a storm, now, that's a good time, too. Find yourself a rain-soaked field. There you go. (chuckles) You found yourself a good one. Yeah, you see that there? Spilled grain. See, let me show you here. Yeah, see that? That's a mealworm. Panfish love 'em. There's all sorts of 'em here. See?

(high-pitched blabbering) (crickets chirping) (chirping continues) See, crickets, now, they're good for bass. I saw a bass in that lake up there, the biggest bass I ever seen. But, well, he ain't ready to be caught yet. Mr. Hoke Moore told me about this valley. You know Mr. Moore? He said there are good people here. He's right. Come on.

I got a brother, though. Travis. He, uh, fell in with some bad company, and wound up in prison. So maybe I'm just waiting for him to get out. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Is that from the war? It must have been terrible. I hope that's all right. Not as good as a barber might have done it but... Well... (chuckles) It's much better than I could of done. Thank you. Hey, Matthew.

The way Taylor's was talking, sounds like you don't even need a hook to catch a fish, boy. (chuckling) Hey. You catch us six river cats a piece before sundown today, we'll give you ten cents a fish. But, uh, you come up short, we keep everything you catch for free. Twelve catfish by sundown. Good Lord, boys, what kind of sucker bet is that? He makes that dozen, it'll cost you a quarter a fish. Quarter a fish? Shoot, Littleberry Davis ain't even that good. Littleberry's the best I ever seen. Littleberry couldn't bait Noah's hook. What do you think, Matthew? Take that bet? Your fisherman's about to catch me a free dinner. I'll bet you three dollars he makes it. You got a bet. No bream, no bass, no trout, no crappie. Good Lord. Them's the rules. MOODY: What's he doing? TAYLOR: Washing the worm slime off his hands. Something you boys ought to do once in a while, wash up a little. He don't seem to be in much of a hurry, does he? (laughter) Hmm. That's cat. Aah. Fourteen inches at least. That ain't but one. Hmm. Lord a'mighty Huh. HOWARD: Yeah, another cat. He found a catfish hole. It's gonna play out after three or four. Why don't he hook no sucker fish or crappie? Hey, you got some sort of secret catfish bait on there? MOODY: You sure that boy knows how to count? TAYLOR: One more time now, Noah, come on. PEAVO: Might as well give up now, fisherman. Don't listen to him. MOODY: You put up a good fight, Noah Locke. No doubt about that, but 11 ain't 12. You ain't gonna make it.

But you owe Noah, here three dollars. And another three for Taylor. (laughter) (Taylor cheering) I feel good. Hey, why don't we all drive to Hayesville, get something to eat? Treat's on me, I got money to burn. Ada's waiting at home for us. Yeah, thank you, Taylor, but maybe some other time. Come on, I'll give you a ride, Noah, unless you want to swim home. All right.

Matthew! Matthew! Matthew! Matthew! (dogs barking) Never seen 'em running around so much. Like they're chasing their own tail. He was here. Digging for earthworms. I'm going up to the lake. See if he was up there. I told Matthew there are ghosts up there. He's scared to death of the place. It's best to check. I'll drive you up. We will find him. All right, let's go walk that creek. Come on. Come on, girl. Matthew! I've got a bad feeling about this. I really do. Taylor, this is fine right here, it's fine. I'm gonna drive the roads. All right. (dogs whimpering, barking) You hear him, girls? (dogs barking) What you hear? Easy, easy. Good girls, you keep listening. Anything? Ground's cold. We lost his scent. I thought I'd wait here just in case Matthew called out, the dogs would hear him. What do you think? We got a lot of people looking for him. People who know the places here pretty good. It bothers me we ain't found nothing. Well, I'm just heading over to Ada's, make some breakfast. You come and eat. No, that's all right. No, no, I won't take no for an answer. I'll have breakfast on the table at first light. (dogs whimpering) All right. NOAH: Matthew! Matthew! Matthew! Matthew! (crying) Nobody goes up there anymore, not with all them ghosts. Lord, I feel bad about this. If we'd just fanned out more. It just happened, that's all. Noah... Howard's been asking for you. I'm gonna miss Matthew. Okay. Sorry, Mr. Reynolds. I told him about a fish in that lake. He went to catch it. It weren't your fault, Noah. Me and my wife know that. Matthew had a good time knowing you. ADA: Howard. He's been, uh... missing his daddy a lot, awful lot lately. And you gave him something he didn't have. Come here. That's my girl. That lake is cursed. First Arch Wheeler dying alone up there, and then Boyd Chatwin. By his own hand. Now Matthew Reynolds, the helpless little lamb. If it were up to me, we'd blow up that lake. If you blow up that lake, you might as well blow up the mountain. Somebody freezes or falls off that mountain every year. And after you blow up the mountain, you'd best go ahead and blow up the roads and the railroads, too. TAYLOR: Well, I'm thinking it might help Howard if we tidy up the yard a little bit. Bound to be a lot of people coming by when they hear about Matthew. I'll do it. Well, I'll wash and wax his car. He's gonna want it clean for the funeral. Oh, Lord, that boy was pretty much their life. Yes, he was. MAN: ...his body we commit to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord. (distant thunder rumbles) Here, says the spirit, they will rest from their labors for their deeds follow them. Gracious God, we thank thee for those we love but see no more. Receive into thy arms your servant, Matthew, and grant that in increasing knowledge and love of You, he may go from strength to strength in service to your heavenly kingdom through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. OTHERS: Amen. Have you been able to reach your son yet? Uh, no. He don't know yet. I left a message for him to call us, but who knows when he'll get that? Mm. Well, we're gonna put off the fishing. No. Too much work already done. People coming in from all over. And, uh, we know the school needs the money. (overlapping chatter in background) MAN: Oh, she'd appreciate it. (footsteps approaching) Taylor's worried about you. You're leaving? (sighs) I should've come up here as soon as they said he ran off. I should've known. You're not a mind reader. You didn't know what that child was gonna do. Had it not been for me... that boy would be at the store right now having an orange Crush with Howard and Ada. All we can do is... love people with a whole heart while we have the chance. And you loved that boy well. I don't know why this world has to shatter to pieces. When I first saw you, I thought an angel might have sent you. I've been alone so long, I can make up things in my head pretty easy. All of us we're... we're hoping for a sign, aren't we? A sign that... we have a purpose... and that we're being guided towards it. Well, I've never seen that sign myself. Maybe you've been that sign for others. A sign for Matthew. I was... hoping a sign for me. I'm nobody to count on. Is walking away the answer, Noah? Will that keep you a pace ahead of the pain? Maybe if you keep walking you'll find a valley where no one has ever suffered a broken heart. But I wager to say... that would be a loveless place.

He should've got here. Where is he? Half the people here come out to see Noah fish. (dog barking) (chuckles) Look at Littleberry. Trying to figure out which one of these people is Noah. All right, everyone, listen here, now. The fishin' starts at the shot. Early casters get a half-hour penalty. Contest ends at 2:00, by my watch. (indistinct conversation) Oh. Fish fry at 5:00. Oh, right. Fish fry starts at 5:00. (gunshot in distance) (people clapping, shouting) (line casting) (indistinct shouting, laughter) WOMAN: There you go! (woman groaning) Got one! Littleberry. Littleberry Davis caught the first fish? Noah would've caught ten by now.

(sighs) You're leaving town? Yes, sir. I never stay for the fish fry. I come for the prize, not the party. Where you headed? Nowhere in particular. Well, if you have a chance, you ought to stop by South Lake. That's where I live. We got some pretty good bass in it. I hear you're staying up at Arch Wheeler's place. No fish up there. (laughs) Old fella always talking about this monster fish he had seen in that lake. Said it was big as a barn. So I go there with two or three of my boys just to see for myself. We stay the night there. Only bite I got was from mosquitoes. Made old Hoke mad, the jawing he took about that phantom fish. Mr. Hoke Moore? Yeah. That's right, old Hoke. Well, now he's the one who told me about this place. Where'd you meet him? I met him in Topton. Yeah, yeah, Hoke died in Topton. Family had him buried there even though he'd lived most of his life here in the valley. Mr. Moore died? Yeah, about five years ago. Sorry to be the one to tell you. Now, Hoke was quite a fisherman. He was the best I ever seen. When he was buried, Peavo Teasley said they ought to put a catfish in the coffin with him so he would feel at home. (laughing) Friend, you don't look too good. You look like you just seen a ghost. Oh, no sir. I don't believe in ghosts. Maybe angels. Thank you. Excuse me. Hey, driver! Travis, for a year I traveled these roads in the hope I could stay a pace ahead of the grief. Here I stopped... was overtaken and left behind with a certainty that we do have purpose in this world. To find this valley, cross the Nantahala River. Follow the Hiawassee west. When you see the bridge, you're almost home. Captioning sponsored by CBS and Hallmark Cards
