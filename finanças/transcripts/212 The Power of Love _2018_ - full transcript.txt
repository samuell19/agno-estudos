Today, November 4, 2016. Millions of people from various areas in Jakarta... ...will gather in Istiqlal. They plan to pray together in Istiqlal... ...before going to the state palace. In the afternoon,... ...they will make a speech... ...and petition to the President in front of the palace. They ask the state to prosecute the case of religious blasphemy... ...committed by one of the government officials... ...in DKI Jakarta. About one million people will join the march... ...and their action will not be in riot. The masses claim that it is... ...a peaceful action of defending Islam. "THE POWER OF LOVE 212" Mr. Sugeng, are you fine? All praises to God. Is this dummy edition... ...for this week? Yes. Okay. Thank you, sir. You're welcome. 411 Action. New form of radical-based social movement... ...that happened in a democracy country. Set by political actors. The pluralist Jakartan are forced to follow the majority. The face of Islam has changed into anarchist. And religion has been degraded as a political weapon. What is this? Are you sure with your writing? Our company will be in trouble if you write this thing. Revise your writing and don't make a trouble. I am a Muslim and I don't like your article. So, you are a Muslim, really? Watch your words. I might look like a mess but I am a true Muslim. Well, you don't know the meaning of your last name, do you? Abdurrahman means man who are loved by God. If you behave like this,... ...God will hate you. Rahmat Asraf Abdurahman. You have Islamic name... ...but you behave like a devil. You talk to and have devil as friend. Use your brain and logic when you talk to me! You're so stubborn. Hurry up, boss. What are we going to discuss? Well, guys, especially you Rahmat,... ...I need to talk about..... -Why? Anyone disagree? It's not like that. Rahmat's case is rare and sensitive,... ...if we make a mistake in our article,... ...we will be in a big trouble, including you. Did you remember your last article? We have got a lot of threats here and there. And 10 times more will be coming if you keep writing the same topic. I don't want bad thing happened..... Mat, where are you going? Say something. Boss! Just to the point. You are the editor in chief! Just dismiss Rahmat's article. Or revise the article. Or if not, we will be considered as anti-Muslim media. Don't create troubles! Din, who dares to take out his article? Rahmat, what's wrong with you? I knew. I got many threat letters. I have never been afraid of the cowards out there... ...who try to perceive my ideology that I believe in. Are these threat letters or love letters? So many! I don't care about any parties. Whether community organization, apparatus, gangsters... ...or religion civilian with turban or Arabic-style clothes. I clearly tell you once again, I am not afraid, got it! Be careful with your words. Don't mention ulama in this our conversation. God will punish you. What a nice word! Cool! You have just started a war with your own communities. Rahmat, Rahmat. Rahmat, listen carefully. Nobody kills your ideology. We must also think about business affairs. We should think about the sustainability of the magazine. So, we are sorry that your writing cannot be published. Okay, understood. If you wouldn't publish my article,... ...it means that you have allowed me to leave this office. I have been waiting to leave this office since I joined here. There are still many other companies would like to hire me. What's going on with you? Hey! Don't go! It's real threat. Are sure that you can let go of the best graduate from Harvard? One of the best journalist in this country? I bet you're not! Hey, where are you going? Okay, good, you clean them up. Boss, you're such a coward. What's going on? Why all you guys become disrespectful? Rahmat, it's wrong if you say that Muslim is radical. Islam is a peace and love. Islam is a blessing and mercy to the entire universe. Your brain is radical. Well, I am radical too, but different. I am romantic radical. Well, prove it to me! Din, you're not romantic radical, you're dirty radical! But, you like me, don't you? Romantic radical, that's so me! Rahmat, can you please hide your arrogant face just for a day? At least smiling, so people would not be afraid to see your face. People who can make me laugh, are those who care of me... ...and help me in difficult situation. They deserve to be kept in my heart. Other than that, they are meaningless. Karl Marx! Who are they? Have you met them? No wonder I always see you alone. I never see you with a girl. Or you probably..... Every choice in life has a reason. And not every reason always in reasonable form. Well, good night. What happened? Uncle, my balloon got stuck over there. Please help. Why do you play balloon at night? Wait, a minute. Wait, a minute. Well, now you hold it carefully. Are you alone? Where's your father? Over there. Sir, is he your son? -Thank you, Sir. Never mind. Enough! I am telling you, this is our final warning. I knew you're a Muslim too. If not, you are dead meat. So don't write irritating articles anymore. Don't you dare defame Islam. You're a Muslim but you destroyed your own religion. You're hypocritical! -Hey! Run! -Are you okay? Why? I told you. You're in trouble now. That's why don't write article like that anymore. Don't you realize that many people hate it? Well, it's not a big problem for now,... ...but later you might die because of this matter. Remember, Mat, your friend is only me. Am I gonna be the one who prays for you? The one who buries you? No way. In the grave, there would be only worms and maggots. Astaghfirullah hal adzim. I feel so pity about your life. You're more pity. You can't move on. You're failed to be a rock star. What you can do is only growing your beard longer. You are similar to any people out there. Watch your words! My hair is an art. Many people out there try to extend their beard... ...using medicine, cream, and else, but I am not. I am charming since I was born. Just so you know, growing the beard is the sunnah of the Prophet. Well, you have messy hair and behaviour. It doesn't fit with your talk about Prophet. Which prophet? Bob Marley, huh? Charity to the poor. Don't talk too much. Let's get in. Whatever. So, what's your opinion, sir? I am concerned about this capital city. This situation is very dangerous and can divide diversity. Can you imagine? Just because an irresponsible statement,... ...then it ignites the emotions and anger of Muslims. Anyway, isn't it beneficial for you? Religion issue could be used by politicians... ...to grab great public sympathy easily. Don't jump into conclusion like that. The background of this issue is indicated as religious blasphemy. But, nowadays, religion... ...is becoming a weapon to get such an authority and power. Wait a moment, sir. I have to pick up the phone. Yes, hello? Where are you going? Excuse me, sir. Mat! What's going on? -My mother died. So, you still have family? Why do you never tell me about your family? I also never see your family pictures in your apartment. So, your Mom is passed away. Is your dad still alive? Dead. He has died in my heart. -Be strong. It's been 10 years I haven't visited my family,... ...I don't know their situation right now. Where does she live? -Ciamis. Help! Help! Help! Thank you, sir. Excuse me. Rahmat, I am sorry I had to contact you. Ever since she was ill, she wanted me to find you. She needed to talk to you, but, she's gone now. It's okay. Don't feel sorry. I am thankful that you called me. Pardon me, I got your number from my brother, Abrar. Abrar told me that he got your number from Republik Magazine... ...where you work there. Please, come in. Be strong. Where's he? -He's inside. Assalamualaikum. -Waalaikumussalam. I am sorry for your lost. -Thank you. Everything belong to Allah and will return to Him. Who is he? -His father. He told me that his father has died. His father is an Islamic leader, but he is the opposite. Be strong, sir. I can't believe that actually you still have family. Do you get situation or what? Excuse me. Thanks, Yasna. -You're welcome. Please enjoy. Yasna. -Yes. I thought angels only live in heaven. But there're one living in Ciamis. Watch you mouth! -What's with you? Speak nicely! I'm telling you, if we never try,... ...our life will never be changed, right? Yasna, do you have boyfriend? Yasna. -Yes. Thank you for having been taking care of mother. My pleasure. Hey, why do you set innocent face in front of Yasna? Stop smiling! No wonder that you don't want to hang out with Rara. Finally, Rahmat come back home again. I thought you forgot the way home... ...and don't want to come home anymore. Excuse me, I have to leave. Assalamualaikum -Waalaikumussalam. Waalaikumussalam. Hey, there's your father. So? -Cool off! Sir. -Eh, Cengli. What's wrong with you? You looks so tired. Bring me a bowl of meatball. Here you are. -Thank you. Only few buyers coming today, Sir. After all the news on TV, The buyer is decreasing. Anything's wrong with me? -Nothing's wrong. It's only on your mind. It's normal if sometime we get more buyer,... ...but the other time we get less. Do not overthinking. -It's make sense. Anyway, I heard that you're going to join rally to Jakarta. CengLi, bring me soy sauce, please! Thank you. Mind your health. Your wife has passed away. You're old. It's better to call out you plan, sir. Let the young people go -Thank you, Ahen,... ...for your care. Hopefully, God will always give me health. I just want to show solidarity. And defend what I believe is right. Take care of your health too. Don't be week like sluggish crackers. Mr. Zainal, the older you get, the crazier you are. Why do you turn it off? It wouldn't be a protestor rally. Is it your picture, Mat? Who are these kids? You guys looks a like. They must be your brothers. Where are they? Hey, I am talking to you. GNPF MUI said that Muslim communities... ...should held another peaceful action on December 2,... ...which will be hold in Monas. A group of Muslim from Ciamis are going to have long march... ...for that action. This action is not about politic,... ...we do it to show that we love Allah SWT and Qur'an. And we will show that it is a peaceful action... ...and fight for justice. Your father will join the rally with lots of people. Are you sure you want to leave? Sooner is better, if possible, in early morning. So, enjoy your last night here. If I don't meet you tomorrow morning,... ...I just want to say thank you for coming. Here is letter from your mother. If we leave tomorrow, how about that old man? Whatever, it's up to him -You're out of your mind. Didn't you see that? Got you! What're you peeking at? -Be quiet! What do you see? -Yasna. Yasna. She's pretty. Go away, don't follow me. Wait up. How pretty. Stop saying about that. It's clear, you know. Just go, you rubbish! Just go! I am Adhin, Yasna's friend. Abrar, who? I am familiar with her friends but, I've never seen you. Who are you? -Don't be rude. Cool off, bro. I am Adhin, nice to meet you. Yasna! Yasna! Yes. What's up, Aunt? This guy told me he's your friend. -Hello, Yasna. It's me Adhin. Well, he's Rahmat's friend. Rahmat? -Yes, Rahmat. My childhood friend, do you forget? Assalamualaikum, Aunt. -Waalaikumussalam. Rahmat, long time no see. You're so handsome now. You were small, thin,... ...smelly and dark-skinned. Abrar, greet him. Did you remember? He used to carry when you're a child. You greet him, please. Aunty really misses you. Let's get in and have dinner together. Thanks God. You still have extra meals and plates, don't you? Wait up. Is it true that he's your friend? Mat. Who are you? Ah, we are best friend. Come. You can eat with us too. Just don't forget to pay after that. Miss Yasna, Uncle Rahmat, come play with me. Yes, later Aisyah. Who is she? She is Aisyah, poor her. About a year ago, Aisyah and her family... ...went for a holiday. But, their car fell into an abyss on their way. All passengers died except Aisyah. Her relatives didn't want to take care of her... ...as she is considered as a bad luck for family. That's why Aisyah lives alone her. So, you take care of the orphanage now? Yes but I am not alone. There are Aunt Nurul and Abrar who also help me. But, yeah, I spend time with the kids everyday. You've never changed. What do you mean? You've been always helping people. If anyone needs helps, you would put it as priorities. I am impressed with you. Miss Yasna, Uncle Rahmat, let's play! Okay, Aisyah. I am so proud of you. -Excuse me, Rahmat. What did you talk about with Yasna? Nothing. Just common topic. We knew each other since childhood anyway. Don't you dare to annoy my sister, I knew who you are. Be careful. See, very pretty. Here! Light it up. Sit down, bro. What are you up to? Schooling. Pesantren. Pesantren As-Syafiyah. So you learn Islam studies, don't you? Yeah. Where do you plan to continue study? I plan to go to Al Azhar, Egypt. -Wow, great! Being a collage student is fun. You have freedom to state your ideology. You can join student clubs, participating in marches. Pretty exciting. When I was studying in Harvard. Yes, Harvard. I discussed case studies. And reviewed literary books. Sometimes, we got theology lesson. I am a Rohis activist. Once a week, I study Quran Interpretation. I join preaching to defend my religion, Islam. I just don't get you, brother. How could you write this? "Piggybacking on Religion for Political Power." Whereas you are a Muslim yourself. As so you know,... ...I am not afraid of cowards out there... ...who harass my religion. Who destruct or desecrating my religion... ...I will fight them with no fear at all. Including you, brother. I will fight you. It's okay. Leave it. I'll help. You're sick. Don't pretend that you're fine. You'd better join me to go to Jakarta. No. This is my home. I won't go. I'll stay here, Rahmat. Mother had just passed away. Nobody would be taking care of you. You're all alone. Please, don't be selfish. Be aware of yourself. There are still many congregations that still love me. They will help me sincerely, unconditionally, at any time. Not like you, living with fear for our own mistake. No friend, bunch of enemies. Now I am asking you? Who's real lonelier here? Okay, fine. So you prefer to live with barbarians. Joining stupid march. Be careful, Dad. I've told you. Don't die silly. Watch your words, son! They move because of love. You will never understand! Never. I wonder if you have love in your heart. How you could love Your God,... ...while you have no care to your family! You should know, dad! I am here for my mother. For my mother! Please don't do this! Don't your feel sorry for your poor father? Please think again. Don't leave now! That old man, no one can rule him but God and himself. And what should we do? Just get in the car and go back to Jakarta. Mat, your father is old and sick. How could you have heart to leave him? When I was just kid, he had heart to leave me. You're really a rebellious son! He wants to join the long march to Jakarta. What if something bad happened? You've heard it, haven't you? He needs his congregations more than me. So, why am I here? -Well, up to you then. If you want to go, just go. I am not your family or your father's son. But I cannot leave him alone! Aisyah, Aisyah! Listen to me, please. Listen to me, please. Where are going to go? Oh God! Please listen! What happened, Aisyah? Uncle, bring me to Jakarta. I want to join the others. Aisyah, listen. You'd better stay, just like other kids. No way! I want to join the march to Jakarta. Well, okay. But please be calm. Be calm. We'll, go there. But please be calm. How are you doing? -Praise to Allah. Dad! See, there are still many who would like to escort me. Don't be arrogant! We both know, you are old and sick. Even if they are many, they will not help you... ...if something bad happened. At the end, I will be the only one who help. What if clash with the apparatus happened? How? Aren't you not afraid? As long as I have God in my heart, I am not afraid of anything. Wow, you're back. Thought you wanted to go home earlier. What insight you got? Or your maybe you feel touched by my wise words. Fellow Muslim, today we are going to have a long rally... ...to Jakarta as an act of peace. Raise your rank and do it all only for Allah. And only for Allah! Father, are you serious? -Yes! Ciamis - Jakarta 350 km. Don't be silly. And now we're both know,... ...who the weaker and more diseased is. Muslim communities from various areas of Indonesia... ...appear to be preparing for follow up... ...action of Defending Islam II, that will be centered... ...in Monas, Jakarta, on Friday, December 2, 2016. In fact, huge mass from Ciamis have been moving to Jakarta. The rally would take distance of about 300 KM,... ...it is expected that they will arrive... ...on December 2, early morning. Their action attracted attention of local residents. A group of woman supported them... ...by distributing provisions for participants. Similar actions was followed by several regions of this country. The government urged the mass to maintain peace on order. Dad, are you okay? -Yes, of course. Now you feel it, it's silly, right? Do you need me to order a car? I am fine, and I just keep walking with the others. What's the different? We will arrived at the same place eventually. Even faster to Jakarta. -It's useless talking to you. Abrar, it's time to pray. Let's go do it together. Straighten and tighten the rows for perfection of shalat. Assalamualaikum. -Waalaikumussalam. Subhanallah. -Masya-Allah. These are God's army. Come in, come in. Come in, eat and drink as much as you want. How's your health, sir? -Praise to Allah. Still going strong? -Yes. For those who have picked up meals, you can go inside and rest. Praise to Allah, Kyai. This is my son. Masya-Allah, how handsome! -Praise to Allah. Is he looks like his father or mother? Where do you go to school? -I have just graduate. He got back home yesterday. Subhanallah, handsome boy. Egypt, bro. Pious boy. You are so lucky to have him. Don't forget to share your knowledge to others, son! Don't keep it for yourself. -Insya-Allah, kyai! I guided him to teach at pesantren. Not only here but some others too. Insya-Allah. Alhamdulillah. Ustadz, I am Rahmat, son of Pak Kyai. Hi Rahmat, Masya-Allah, your son is no less charming. He must be following you everywhere you go... ...for giving Islamic lecture, right? No. I am a journalist. -Oh, journalist. Must be at Da'wah Magazine. No. I work for Republik Magazine. Subhanallah. Where did you go to school? What major? I studied at Harvard University, US. You knew that, right? I am the best graduate. How amazing our children, Kyai! They went so far to study at the best universities... ...whereas us went to school nearby hometown at boarding school. But it's useless, Ustadz. He studied abroad but forgets Allah. He'd better become a mosque keeper here. Well, drop it. Let's just have a rest. We can continue our conversation tomorrow. Come, get in! Well, your father is right. As a mosque keeper, you would conduct adhan,... ...clean up the floor. You will definitely go to heaven when you're dead. Rehan, aren't you fed up of studying religion? I am pretty sure that ever since you're new-born until today,... ...you learn about religion everyday. Come on, this world is big and you're still young. Don't be like frogs under the coconut shell. Hey man! You talk like a devil really. Brother, until I am old, even to the point of death,... ...I will never get enough of studying religion. Studying religion is studying life,... ...it rules everything from the small to bigger ones... ...religion is a guide to life. A Harvard graduate is being lectured by a kid. Hey, religion... ...is breath for desperate person... ...thinking that it will bring them to heaven. Don't let religion kills you logic. Do you get it, young man! Rehan, join me to the mosque. Don't listen to him. He's lost! Father, we'd better get back to Ciamis. I heard the news from my friend that Police, State Army,... ...and Banser are sent to Monas. You and all rally participants are used by political persons. Understand? This soon will become rebellious action. Rahmat, don't you realize that your mind is possessed by demons? You always have a negative mind all the time. Okay. Just give me a second. We will go to Monas, but three of us will ride a car. I am upset of him. He's old, sick yet so stubborn! Like father like son. Aren't you going to mosque? Drink first. Hello, Rara. Where are you now? On my way home. I just got back from Yogyakarta. What is it, bos? So, here's the thing. Could you please report for 212 Action tomorrow? There must be a huge mass. Get ready! But, that's Rahmat's area. He will be mad at me if I take over his thing. Rara, I am the boss. Like it or not, you should cover this event. Contact Rahmat for coordination. But please, I want an objective coverage from you. Are you sure? But I am not a Muslim. What if I am raged? -Rara, you are a journalist. Be professional. You're protected by the law. Do not worry, you just need to wear a proper dress. Be ready for tomorrow, okay? -Fine, Boss. Rahmat and Adhin, I need to go to bed. If you need meals or drinks, take it your own. Make yourselves at home. -Thank you very much, sir. My pleasure. -Thank you for having us, sir. Take a look at this! He looks fierce, his face seems so stiff like a dry towel. But he's also narcissist. If we look closely, he really looks like you and your father. Maybe you guys looked similar back then the same age. Rohis leader. I was vice president of Rohis. Impossible! How did trash like you be the vice president of Rohis? I am serious. Are you healthy? Your brain has a cold. You never trust me! Dad? Dad? Dad, what happened? Don't move! Straighten your leg! Straighten your leg! Straighten your leg! Not like that. Straighten your leg! Does your hips hurt? -Nothing. Which part is hurt? -Nothing. Really? -Nothing. What are you doing? Take a bath? -Yeah. It touched the floor, you might think it's impure. Whose is this? Your towel? Show me your back. But your legs are fine, aren't they? Hot! -Hot? I'm fine, thank you. I heard you screaming. What are you doing in the bathroom? I'm worried! Bathing an old baby! You're silly. Let me wipe. Rahmat, let's hurry up. Let's go to Jakarta. Lots of people have been waiting for us. Are you sure you want to keep going? Your health is declining. Who offer me to ride car yesterday? The bus carrying Yasna and other women arrived this morning. We will join them so we can make it on time to Monas. So, we'll take a bus? Watch out! Be careful Aisyah. Let's go to the mosque first. Please, sir, your meal. Allow me to help you? Please put the trash in the trash bag, sir. We also have tea and coffee. Your drink, sir. Aunt Nurul. Aunt Nurul. Hey, you're here already. Where's the handsome guy? Please take your drink, sir. You can have a tea or coffee here. Hello, Rahmat. Boss asked me to cover 212 event. I knew it's your coverage. Is it okay for you? No problem for me. But listen, I heard the recent news that... ...this action will transform into rebellious action. It is exploited by political persons. At the end there'll be riots like what happened in 1998. Where are you anyway? I am with my father, trying to thwart their trip to Jakarta. I am afraid that they'll die silly. Okay, thank you. I can't believe that you are a traitor! Abrar, you should understand that you,... ...father and other people are being used by political persons. I am trying to save you before anything bad happen. Who do you save? Us? You only think about yourself. Aren't you satisfied of badmouthing Islam through your writing? Now you're trying to stop us defending our own religion. Hey, you are an educated, you should be rational. Abrar! Istighfar! What are you doing? He is a traitor, sister! Oh, so this is how you behave toward Rahmat? I am ashamed of you, Abrar! Remember Abrar, he is also your brother! You should respect him. Abrar, stop it! Seek Allah's forgiveness! Aren't you ashamed that Aisyah is watching now? Go now! Are you okay, Aisyah? Excuse me, sir. Can we get through this way? The road is filled with march participants. If you want, park the bus near here,... ...then you with your group walk to Monas. Thank you, Sir. -You are welcome. Ladies and Gentlemen, because the road... ...is loaded by march participants,... ...we will continue our trip on foot. Are you ready? -Yeah! Come on! Sister, what are you doing? Get down! Get down! Excuse me, where are you going? Forgive me if I'm wrong, sir. -Take it easy, sis. We just want to give this to all the journalists... ...who are covering here. -Thank you Please cover the news. Dhin, have you seen my father? -Your father? Call Yasna. Maybe he joined her group. Assalamualaikum, Yasna. -Yes. He is not with me. What happen? Oh God! What should I do? Okay, I will contact you if I meet him. Oh my God, Abah. Oh My God. -Oh My God. Yasna? -How are you? Praise to Allah. It's been a while, Yasna. Who are you looking for? You looks upset. I am looking for Rahmat's father. Mr. Zainal? He is here too? Masya-Allah, no strength except with Allah. Salute to him! God willing, if we meet again, we will meet Mr. Zainal. I need to go to the camp. Stay safe, honey, keep fighting. You too sister. Quran is my guidance and instructions. Takbir! -Allahu Akbar. My fellow Muslims, do you hear me? Tighten you rank and stay unified! Allahu Akbar. -Allahu Akbar. What's going on? -Come over here! How dare! How dare you to come here! You don't know how big our power is? Guys, this man claims to be Muslim,... ...but he himself is the one who divide religion... ...through his anti-Islam writings! You are a traitor! Hypocrite! A person like you should be banished! What I knew is, you claimed yourselves God's army... ...to bring peace message but you act like a barbarian. What did you said? -Stop it! Stop! Is this what you called peaceful action? Aren't you ashamed of the elderly who has travelled... ...hundreds of kilometers only to join this action? Don't you understand why the women come here? They wants to show the world that Islam is not radical. Do you still remember our purpose of participating the march? We demand for justice of the person who despise our religion. Not to vigilante. We're here not because we angry, but because we love. Love moves the heart of millions people to come here. But he's a hypocrite! -That's right! Not much different to kafir. Istighfar, Brother! So easy for you to point out your fellow as kafir. He is a Muslim. He becomes apathetic toward Islam because he doesn't understand. Is it reason enough for us to call him kafir and judge him? If you guys think you are Muslims, guide him. You're all muslims, right? -Whatever. Let's go! Make ways! Hi, what are you doing? We want to get married at the church over there. Yeah, I know. But, why you do it today? The mass are blocking the area. We are minority, we could be in danger. I knew. But I heard it is a peaceful action. So i guess everything will be fine. In fact, they're helping us. Don't argue. Keep walking. Sir, give us walk. I asked my fellow journalist for combing location and... ...they said that they saw an old man looks like your father... ...under the tree over there. Father, let's go home. I am so fed up with all this. What are you doing, let me go! -Go home! Let go off me! Who are you to forbid me? Me? I am your son. So now, you claim to be my son. Thank so much then. I am tired of all this. Following your rule. I am fed up. Let me tell you, as father, I have right to say... ...anything to my son for the sake of his betterness. It's up to you how you're going to grow your kids. But well, you might get no kids since you're lonely,... ...no friends, bunch of enemies and living under your mistake. That same topic again. I am what I am today is because of you. Stop it, Mat. Everyone is watching. Only cowards blame on others for their own failure. Why did you send me to pesantren that contained misbehaved kids? That was how I made you learn from your mischief... ...burning the whole mosque... ...with your fireworks. That's silly, you know! I was only eleven that time. 11 years old boy should have been able... ...to differ what is right or wrong. But you never visited me even once. Only mother came to see me before graduation. You never knew, Dad! I was like living in jail. Rahmat, who did you think the one gave you decent place to stay? Who sent you money? Who gave you foods to feed your mouth? Who used to pay for your school? Your mother was only a housewife. And you asked for more? Ask yourself, why didn't you humble yourself... ...to visit me even once to say thank you. Or at least you go home to see your mother? Why? You want to know why? Because I knew I was not the kid you expect in the family. I was busy making a live for myself. I did that because I didn't want to been seen as a failure. You were busy giving your congregations lecture,.. ...giving enlightenment. You're crazy of being respected. Hand kissed. But what happen to your own son? It was a big zero. Your mother and I always waited you to come home. But you yourself never want to went home, Rahmat. And you keep blaming on me. Now I am asking you,... ...for everything that I have done to you, is it useless? What advantages? You've sent me into jail. The real one. What advantages? Oh God! You killed many people. Your brothers died because of your carelessness driving car... ...without my permission. Your mother and I were so broken for lost the two children. I was 16 years old. I was 16 years old! But you're losing people's lives. Include your two little brothers, my children! Did you know? I got scholarship... ...from Harvard University, US. -That's great! And I am one of the best graduates. Every parent in any part of this world... ...should be proud to have kid like me. I wish I am the one of those parents. But, no. Please don't argue. Everyone's watching. Enough. Let's go!
