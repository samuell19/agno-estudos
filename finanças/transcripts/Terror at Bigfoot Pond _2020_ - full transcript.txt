Maybe I should go check up on him? [air pump whirring] [suspenseful music] Tommy, I was so worried about you. - [Tommy] There's nothing to worry about, I mean. - Piece of shit. - [Tommy] We're out here all alone. Chill babe, gosh. It's all right, chill, chill. It's all right babe, chill, we're alone to here. - Don't do that. - Nothing's gonna get me. Do you guys wanna hear a ghost story or what? - Yeah. - I don't know man. - [Tommy] Come on. - Jumpy night. - [Tommy] Don't be scared. - [Karen] I'm kinda freaked out. - [Tommy] It'll be all right. It's the chief's mummy. - What is that? - What's the chief's mummy? - The chiefs mummy, you've never heard of that? All right, you guys. So I did some research online and Bigfoot's not the only legend out here. - Yeah right, come on. - Really? - [Tommy] Seriously. It's the chief's mummy. - What is that? - Is the chief's mummy real? - [Tommy] The chiefs mummy, you've never heard of that. - No. - No. - [Tommy] According to what I read, there's an old Indian burial ground somewhere up on the hill that belongs over to the Anasazi. Anasazi. - You're just trying to freak us out. - Yeah. - That is kinda freaky though. - [Tommy] I know guys. - Yeah. - I'm scared. Well don't tell us anymore. Well, wait, wait, tell us. - [Tommy] Do you want to hear it? - Don't, don't, don't. Okay, okay, go. - Okay now you have to tell us, come on. - [Tommy] All right guys. So there was some college kids about our age, probably about the same time of year as right now, out here doing their summer project for college. There's an archeological dig. - Archeological? - Yeah, there you go, right around the corner. - Are you serious man? - [Tommy] Dude, I'm serious all right? - Okay, okay, I'm just checking, I'm just checking. - Here? - [Timmy] Yes, just right over the hill right over there. - This is kinda creepy. - What did they find then? - So what happened? - [Tommy] So they found what they thought looked like a log, all right, but upon further investigation, they realized that it was a coffin. And inside the coffin was an old Indian chief with a big feathered headdress wearing a bunch of like turquoise necklaces and coral, silver, all kinds of creepy shit - Wow. - I think we should leave man. [Tommy chuckles] - Yeah, I don't wanna camp on any Indian burial ground dude. - I mean was it right here or was it? - It's not. - Told you, it was just a little bit over the hill all right guys, chill, don't be so scared, it's just a story all right? - Yeah it's cool. - [Tommy] Do you wanna hear what else happened or? - Yeah, now. - [Tommy] All right, all right, so at first everything was good. Nobody, nothing was going on, everything was just perfect. You know, get there, do your work, everything's great. But then. - Students? - [Tommy] Yeah the students, but at the end of every day basically, okay so when they get there, you know, they clean up, do all their shit, get everything organized, put away all the little things they find all day, you know. The next day, whenever they get there, it's all over the fucking campground. I mean pieces everywhere. Nobody knows what the fuck's going on, tables are turned upside down, everyone's freaking out. They're just. - Like a monkey, like a monkey threw everything around right, or something. - [Tommy] If there was monkeys over here, man but there ain't monkeys dude. They don't know what it was all right. - Like there's no monkeys in this region? - [Tommy] There's no monkeys, there's no monkeys. - How do you know that? - Dude, we're in the mountains. - Oh. - [Tommy] Where you from man? No, just. - No more monkeys. - Was it a bear? - [Tommy] Anyway, so. After that night they're going to dinner, they have this big military type tent, okay guys? I mean, I'm talking huge with one of those old, like potbelly stoves in there and everything. Everyone's sitting around eating dinner. Everything's great and they hear this noise outside. [dirt crunching] They go to investigate it, all right? There's nothing out there, nothing. - Whoa. - Wow. - Shit. - That's spooky. - [Tommy] That's the last time anyone ever heard from any of them again after that. The next morning they packed up and then nobody knows where they went. - Wait, they packed up? - [Tommy] Yeah, after the noises the next morning, they're like, screw this we're getting outta here. Nobody knows what happened to them. Apparently it's the chief's mummy, man. - The chiefs mummy? - [Tommy] Yeah. - I'm gonna look it up. - [Tommy] He comes out on full moon nights, just like tonight. [dirt crunching] Whatever you guys do, don't, and I'm telling you don't go out there if you hear that sound. - Who's idea was it to come out here in the first place? [Tommy humming] - [Darryl] You know what, we need to change up that mood guys. - [Tommy] I agree. - [Darryl] That's a little bit creepy. No offense, but how about some music? - [Jewel] Oh cool, a drum. - Okay, I'm not great at this but I'm gonna try and let's see. [Darryl drumming] - [Tommy] Yeah man, that sounds good. - All right, wait a second. [Darryl drumming] Oh shit. - [Johnnie] Damn. - [Tommy] Ladies. [Darryl drumming] Oh. [Johnnie humming] [Johnnie whistling] [tent zips] - Let's go to the pond. - All right, let's do it. - All right, bring your IC150. - Oh yeah. You're in a wild mood tonight, shit. - You bet I am. - Smile for the camera. [Karen laughs] [dirt crunching] - [Karen] All right. - [Tommy] I was like fuck, I laid out the mattress. [dirt crunching] [fire crackling] [crickets chirping] [dramatic chord] [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [trees rustles] [dramatic music] [both moaning] [dramatic music] [both moaning] [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [both moaning] [dramatic music] [both laughing] [dramatic music] [Karen moaning] [dramatic music] [Karens neck cracks] - What the fuck Karen? Babe? What the fuck, Karen! What the fuck, where you at Karen? Karen! What the fuck babe? Hey! [crickets chirping] Karen, what the fuck babe? Hey, Karen! [Tommy choking] [fire crackling] Karen! - It's nice and warm here. - [Tommy] What the fuck babe! - I wonder what Tommy and Karen are doing? - [Tommy] Karen! - I don't hear anything. - Where are they? - Shout out like you guys. [group laughs] We heard you. - Look who's talking. [group laughs] - It's been a wild ride. - Yeah, we know. [group laughs] - Oh man, I think I'm going to go see where Tommy and Karen, where they went to, okay guys? - Okay. - I'll be back in a minute okay? - Okay, I'll be right here hanging out with the rest of the group. - Okay. [Darryl sighs] [dramatic music] [Bigfoot growls] [dramatic music] [dirt crunching] [wood thudding] [dirt crunching] [Bigfoot growling] - Shit. [camera rustling] What the fuck? I'll be damned. [camera scrapping] Tommy? Something is definitely wrong. Why would he leave his. Something's not right, Karen and Tommy aren't here. I see sleeping bags. Something's definitely not right. Tommy! Karen? Shit. Tala. Gotta get back to Tala, okay. [Bigfoot growling] [Darryl cries out] [Darryl's bones cracking] [Bigfoot growling] - [Tala] Darryl? Oh my God. Goddess I pray on you, where are you? [Bigfoot grunting] [dirt crunching] Darryl? [Tala screams] No, no. [Bigfoot growling] [Tala screams] [Tala's bones cracking] - [Johnnie] Yeah, I can't, I don't think I have any either. - Someone should take a car and call for help. - [Johnnie] Okay, before we panicked, let's go take a look for ourselves. - [Kelly] Okay, grab the lanterns. [Tala screams] [dramatic music] [dirt crunching] [dramatic music] What do you think happened? - [Jewel] This is too much. I dunno, this is too much guys all right. - Well Daryl said he did see footsteps. - [Johnnie] I don't know, let's be logical here. I mean Bigfoot isn't real, right? - Well, I don't know. Didn't you see all that footage that they got in Oregon back in like what, the seventies? A bunch of scientists analyzed it and they couldn't find anything fake about it, like at all. - [Johnnie] I don't know, it seems kind of farfetched. - But there's so much evidence though. - Yeah, I wouldn't be too sure. - Yeah, well, now that I'm thinking about it, I'm remembering the story that my nanny used to tell me. I think she just told me just to keep me away from the forest and everything, you know, like a cautionary tale, but she used to tell me that she would be in her backyard and it was out in the woods like this, and she would be swinging and she would swing to get as high as she could. She wanted to touch the sky, she said. And one day the chain broke and she really went flying and she broke her leg and she said, this big, hairy man came out of the forest and carried her all the way up to her sliding door and then ran back. I don't know, do you think it could have been big foot? - Hey, Darryl said he did see footsteps. - [Jewel] I don't think we should rule it out. - I agree, maybe we should get going. - [Jewel] Yeah, let's just keep looking. [dramatic music] [Bigfoot groaning] [dirt crunching] [Bigfoot heavy breathing] - [Kelly] Is that? - [Jewel] Oh my God, are they? - [Kelly] Are they? - [Johnnie] Yes. [girls screaming] - [Jewel] Wait Kelly, no! - [Johnnie] Kelly come back! - [Jewel] Kelly! - [Johnnie] Kelly! - [Jewel] We have to go after her. - Kelly! - Kelly! - [Johnnie] Kelly come back. - [Jewel] Come back Kelly! - We gotta find Kelly. - [Jewel] We have to keep looking. - The best thing we can do is get back to the car and get reception. - [Jewel] All right, let's go. - We got to call for help, let's go. - [Jewel] Fine. All right, yeah, let's go. I mean fast, come on. [dirt crunching] - [Man] What was that? [wind whistling] [camera scrapping] - I got to get out of here, which way? Shit. [Bigfoot growling] I got to get away. [dirt crunching] [camp clattering] [Bigfoot growling] [furniture thudding] Shit. Fuck. [Kelly heavy breathing] [Bigfoot growling] [Bigfoot growling] [Bigfoot snarls] [Bigfoot roars] [wood thuds] - [Jewel] Oh my God. - [Johnnie] Oh my God. Okay, okay, okay, grab some food, I'll go grab the Jeep and we'll four wheel over here and we'll get the fuck out of here. - All right yeah, hurry though. - [Johnnie] I'll be fast. [Bigfoot growling] - Fuck, I'm lost. Shit. What am I even doing out here? I'm a city girl. I think this way, maybe. [wood thudding] What was that shit? [Bigfoot growling] - [Johnnie] Gotta get the fuck out of here. What the fuck happened to the cars? Oh no, shit. [wind whistling] [man sniffing] Serious? [Bigfoot growling] [car door bangs] [glove compartment clattering] [ice scraper thuds] [Bigfoot growling] Let's hope it works. [Johnnie sighs] Damn! Fuck, shit! - [Tommy] Chicken. - What the fuck is that, leave me alone, leave me alone! What the fuck? What is next? Leave me alone, leave me alone! - In case I don't make it, I'm want to leave my car to my sister, Yvonne. Yvonne, I know it's not the best car, but it will get you a little Larry around. Remember you have to wiggle the key a little bit to get it to turn and take care of Prissy, my cat. She loves albacore tuna the best. And give uncle Bill the painting mom gave me. He always liked that painting and, and. - We're getting out of here. Karen and Tommy are missing. I didn't even believe in big foot, I have no idea what the fuck is going on. - I don't want to die, not like this, not here. I can make it, I can do it. Which way would the highway be? If I can find the highway, I can stop a car and get help. I know what I can do. [Bigfoot growling] - God damn, where's my wallet? God, I think it's in the tent. [tent rustling] [Jewel screams] [Bigfoot growls] [Jewel screaming] [Bigfoot growling] [Jewel screaming] - [Johnnie] Get away off of her! [Bigfoot screams] Get off, get off of her! Get off of her! [Jewel screams] - [Jewel] Help! - [Johnnie] Get outta here! Get outta here! [Bigfoot growling] - Oh my God, he had me, he had me. I could have died, oh my God. - [Johnnie] It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. - Ah, I got my compass. I remember using my compass in astronomy class. Who knows I would ever of used this. This could give me better direction. Great. - [Man] I forgot something. [dirt crunching] [eerie whispering] [dirt crunching] I forgot something. [dirt crunching] [dog barking] [dirt crunching] - Oh my God, what are we gonna do? - [Johnnie] It's about a two hour hike to the highway, if we leave right now. Let's see what we have in the bag. [bag rustling] This'll do. We gotta get outta here. Let's go. - [Jewel] Okay. [Bigfoot growling] [bag rustling] [bag zips] [bag rustling] - My grandfather gave me this knife and this will be the first time I've ever used it. [Bigfoot roaring] - [Jewel] Let's just sits down, I need to rest, just for a minute. - Yeah, me to. Drink some water. - What's going on? - I don't know. I don't understand any of this. - But why, why is he so mad, I don't get it. - I don't know, maybe he's just tired of people coming and camping at his pond. - Yeah, but you wouldn't kill people. - I mean, no I wouldn't. I'm not crazy. - Let's just change the subject. - I agree. - How far do you think we have to go? - Maybe another half an hour if we keep up the pace. - Yeah. Better get going if we're going to find Kelly, I'm worried about her. - Yeah. - I hope she's okay. - Me to. - Come on, let's keep on. - Let's go. [dirt crunching] [owl hoots] [Bigfoot growling] - [Jewel] I think I see headlights up there, look, it's the highway. - [Johnnie] We're saved. - [Jewel] Oh my God, we're saved, we can get out of here. [dirt crunching] [Bigfoot growling] [dirt crunching] [Johnnie heavy breathing] [Bigfoot growling] [dirt crunching] [dirt crunching] [Bigfoot growling] [dirt crunching] - I heard something. [Kelly screams] Help me, help me! You let me go! [Kelly screams] - [Johnnie] That's Kelly. - That's Kelly. No, we have to go help her. - [Johnnie] But we're so close. - No, we have to, Kelly needs us now. Okay, I'm going with or without you. - [Johnnie] Jewel, wait. Jewel! [fire crackling] [dirt crunching] [Bigfoot growls] What the? [metal clangs] [Bigfoot roaring] [dirt crunching] [fire crackling] [Bigfoot roars] [fire crackling] [bones snapping] [metal clangs] [fire crackling] [fire crackling] [dirt crunching] [dirt crunching] - [Jewel] Kelly. - [Johnnie] Kelly, - [Jewel] Kelly, it's us. Kelly. - [Johnnie] Kelly. - [Jewel] Oh yeah, Kelly it's us. [Kelly whimpering] - [Jewel] Kelly? - [Johnnie] Kelly. There's a cooking thing. - [Jewel] Oh yeah. Look, there's a bag. Maybe there's something in it we can use. - [Johnnie] Yeah maybe. Let's check it out. [Jewel screams] - All right remember your astronomy girl. That is the big dipper over there. Draw a line to the two outer most stars in the cup, which will take me to Polaris. [Jewels screams] The North star, which means this way is East. I know the highway is East, so East we go [dirt crunching] [Jewel screams] [fire crackling] [rooster crows] - Let's keep going. [zipper zips] [man chuckles] - That has to be the highway. It's farther away than I thought. Shit. I wish I had my bandana. Oh, wait a minute. [bag zips] - [Man] Oh God. [dirt crunching] - [Johnnie] Let's keep going. - What's that? Kelly? - [Johnnie] Kelly? - [Jewel] Kelly. - [Johnnie] Kelly. - Kelly? - Kelly? - [Jewel] Kelly. - [Johnnie] Kelly. - [Jewel] Kelly it's us. Kelly. [all screaming] [Bigfoot roaring] - [Jewel] Johnnie, run he's right behind you, run! [Jewel screams] [Bigfoot roaring] [Jewel panting] Oh fuck. [Bigfoot roaring] [wood thudding] [brush rustling] - I'm so tired, but I can't stop. I'm going to climb this hill here and get my bearings. Okay, you can do this girl. [brush rustling] - Which way do I go? I don't know. Oh God, I don't have. Oh God, I don't have. [Jewel screaming] [Jewels bones crack] [Jewel thuds] [Bigfoot growls] [dirt crunching] [dramatic music] [dramatic chord] [dramatic music] [Bigfoot growling] [Kelly yells] [Bigfoot cries out] [Bigfoot growling] [Kelly yelling] [Bigfoot growls] [Big foot growls] [Kelly yells] [Bigfoot growls] [Kelly yells] [Bigfoot cries out] [grass rustling] [engine rumbles] - Oh my God, are you all right? Here. [engine rumbles] [car door bangs] Let me help you, let's go to the hospital, here. [car door bangs] Let's go [car door bangs] [engine rumbles] You look terrible here, have some water. Is this a camera? Let me put it up here. Is there anybody else out there? What happened? - They're dead, they're all dead. - [Woman] What? - My friends, they're all dead. - [Woman] Oh my God. - Bigfoot. - [Woman] Bigfoot? - Bigfoot killed them all. - [Woman] Bigfoot, what? Oh my God. [Kelly crying] I'll lock the door. [Kelly crying] [engine rumbles] [dramatic music] [Kelly crying]
