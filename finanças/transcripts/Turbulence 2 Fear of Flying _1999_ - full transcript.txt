CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY TRIMARK HOME VIDEO [RADIO CHATTER] Woman: WITH SERVICE TO 26 COUNTRIES ON 4 CONTINENTS, WE PUT THE WORLD WITHIN YOUR REACH. FLY TRANS-CON AIR. RELAX, SIT BACK, ENJOY. 30% OF AMERICAN ADULTS ARE AFRAID TO FLY. THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH PLACES IT ONLY SECOND TO THE FEAR OF PUBLIC SPEAKING, SO WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH HERE IS VERY COMMON. MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT CAN BE OVERCOME. REMEMBER, JUST RELAX, SIT BACK, AND ENJOY. UHH! AAH! OH, MY. OHH! WHAT WAS THAT? IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S JUST A LITTLE TURBULENCE. YOU'LL BE FINE, ELLIOT. JUST TAKE DEEP BREATHS. [INHALES, EXHALES] WELL, I SUPPOSE IT COULD BE WORSE. I COULD BE LIKE... LIKE POINDEXTER OVER THERE. VIEW OPTIONS. SELECT WIREFRAME. ROTATE WIREFRAME TO DELTA 2 AND ENHANCE.

NOW, I KNOW EACH OF YOU HAVE DEMONS TO CONQUER-- CLAUSTROPHOBIA, FEAR OF TECHNOLOGY, [LAUGHS] BAD AIRLINE FOOD. BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU SUFFERING FROM A FEAR OF HEIGHTS, THIS NEXT EXERCISE MAY BE A BIT TRICKY, BUT IT'S OFTEN VERY EFFECTIVE. SO LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN DO THIS. Hazel: NOW, IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING NEXT TO THE WINDOWS, TRY CLOSING YOUR EYES FIRST AND THEN OPENING THEM ONCE YOU GET NEXT TO THE GLASS. Jessica: COME ON, YOU GUYS. IT'S NOT SO TOUGH. MAYBE NOT FOR HER, BUT I'M A FREAK ABOUT HEIGHTS. YEAH, ME, TOO. BUT... WHATEVER DOESN'T KILL US ONLY MAKES US STRONGER. WOULDN'T YOU SAY? YEAH, I SUPPOSE SO, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF GOITER AND IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME. I DON'T THINK EITHER OF THOSE MAKES YOU STRONGER. YES. THAT'S GOOD. RIGHT. COME ON. WE'LL OPEN OUR EYES ON 3.

WILL BE IN A 747 IDENTICAL TO OUR BOEING SIMULATOR. THE FLIGHT HAS ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF PASSENGERS, SO THE ATTENDANTS CAN GIVE YOU THEIR FULL ATTENTION. OH, AND DON'T FORGET TO ARRIVE EARLY FOR OUR WALK-THROUGH. SO I'VE, UM... HEARD ABOUT THIS QUAINT LITTLE RESORT ON THE ISLAND OF LANAI, WHERE YOU SLEEP IN THATCHED BUNGALOWS ALONG THE BEACH. PERHAPS I COULD RUSTLE US UP A PAIR OF TICKETS AND SOME GRASS HULA SKIRTS. YOU REALLY SURE YOU WANT TO GO TO THE ISLANDS NOW? I MEAN, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT HAWAIIAN DISEASE. WHAT DISEASE? LACK-OF-NOOKY. OH, DEAR GOD. I'M SORRY, BUT DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD GO ON ANOTHER DATE BEFORE, YOU KNOW...

OH, THAT'S, UH, THAT'S NOT MINE. THAT'S, UH, RAPTOR THE DEATH-KNIGHT. ARRGH! I HOPE IT'S NOT A BAD OMEN. ACTUALLY... WE'RE IN LUCK, STATISTICALLY SPEAKING. THERE HAVE NEVER BEEN 2 747 CRASHES WITHIN 3 MONTHS OF EACH OTHER. AND SINCE THAT AIR MOROCCO JET WENT DOWN KILLING THOSE 213 PASSENGERS, I'D HAVE TO SAY THE LAW OF AVERAGES IS ON OUR SIDE. THANKS AGAIN. WELL, HE'S JUST A REAL WINNER, ISN'T HE? DEAR GOD. I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET THE WIFE AND KIDS ON FLIGHT DAY. MARTIN'S A LITTLE NEUROTIC, BUT I THINK HE'S NICE.

THEIR INBOUND WAS DELAYED. I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM COMING FROM SFO. A STORM'S SOCKED IN MOST OF THE COAST, [OVER P.A.] AND IT'S DUE TO ARRIVE HERE BEFORE NIGHTFALL. A STORM? WE'RE NOT GONNA FLY THROUGH THAT, ARE WE? [OVER P.A.] MORE SNOW? AWESOME. I'M SKIING WHISTLER THIS WEEKEND. AH, NO SNOW. MORE RAIN. [OVER P.A.] THE CAPTAIN SAID IT'S GOING TO GET ROCKY.

OH, IT'S, UH, IT'S JUST THE LANDING GEAR. WELL, ACTUALLY, WHAT YOU JUST HEARD WERE THE FLAPS RETRACTING. YOU SEE, IN A 747, THE FLAP MECHANISM LOCKS TO AVOID WING VORTEX DAMAGE AT CRUISING SPEED.

A PLANE CRASH? [SIGHS] I, UH... JUST--JUST--I'M SORRY. I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID ANYTHING. WHEN I GET NERVOUS, I TALK A LITTLE TOO MUCH. YES, WELL, YOU'VE GOT IMPECCABLE TIMING. WELL, JUST SAY IT WASN'T DURING TAKEOFF WITH A 747. NO, ACTUALLY, IT WAS, UM... IT WAS DURING LANDING. WE WERE COMING BACK FROM A SKI TRIP, AND WE WERE IN ONE OF THOSE SMALL TURBO PROPS. WAS ANYBODY HURT? WELL, THERE WERE A LOT OF BROKEN BONES, AND, UH, ONE PERSON WAS PARALYZED, AND ANOTHER ONE PASSED AWAY. WHAT ABOUT YOU? HMM. THAT'S THE FUNNY PART. I...I GOT OUT WITHOUT A SCRATCH.

Reynolds: HE DOESN'T SEEM TO SPEAK ENGLISH. HE'S DEMANDING THAT WE LAND IMMEDIATELY. Sikes: NEGATIVE, TRANS-CON 110. WE'VE GOT CLASS ONE MICROBURST WIND SHEARS. REDIRECT TO CLEAR AIR HOLDING PATTERN OVER PACIFIC. CIRCLE 75-MILE RADIUS FROM VOR 2-2-8. JUST INLAND FROM THE COAST. FUEL STATUS? 35,000 POUNDS. FUEL IS LOW, BUT IT'S ALSO LOW ON MY LIST OF PRIORITIES RIGHT NOW. UNDERSTOOD, 110. CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 1-5-0, CIRCLE ON AUTO. WE'LL ADVISE FAA SITUATION RED. STAND BY. TRANS-CON 110 CLIMBING 1-5-0. CIRCLE ON AUTO. YOU TELL OUR FRIEND HERE THIS-- WE BARELY SCRAPED OUT OF SEATTLE, AND WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF PLACES TO LAND BY THE MINUTE REGARDLESS OF WHAT HE WANTS. WE HAVE TO HEAD BACK TO A SAFER ALTITUDE AND WAIT WITH LIMITED FUEL UNTIL WE GET THE GREEN LIGHT TO LAND. IF HE CAN'T WAIT AND HE WANTS US ALL TO DIE, YOU TELL HIM TO GO AHEAD AND USE THE BOMB. [THUNDER] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE I'M DOING? [TURNS AIR ON] MR. KAPINSKI-- GIMME A BREAK. WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? SHUT UP AND GIVE ME ONE OF THOSE. OK. UH, SIR, PORTLAND IS STILL OFF-LINE, SOCKED IN TO REDMOND. TRANS-CON ONLY HAS ABOUT 60 MINUTES FLIGHT TIME. YOU THINK WE SHOULD JUST TAKE THE CHANCE BACK HERE? OH... EVERYTHING WANTS THEM DOWN-- THE PILOT, FUEL TANKS, THE TERRORIST. EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE WEATHER. WELL, SOMETHING MIGHT BREAK. MR. SIKES? DIRECTOR HOBBS, FAA FLIGHTCON. THIS IS LIEUTENANT DICKSON OF THE FBI. SEATTLE P.D. IS ON-SITE WORKING WITH HIM. EXCUSE ME. TRANS-CON 110, RADAR REPORTS YOU'RE IN FOR SOME CHOP. OVER. Reynolds: ROGER THAT, SEATTLE CENTER. SORRY. HOW'S IT GOING? OH...I'VE HAD BETTER DAYS. [MAN SHOUTING IN CZECH] [WOMAN MOANS] [MAN SHOUTING IN CZECH] [THUNDER] YAAH! UNH! AAH! AAH! [WOMEN SCREAMING] [SHOUTING] AAH! [SCREAMING] SEATTLE CENTER, TRANS-CON 110. WE HAVE GUNFIRE ON BOARD. REPEAT, WE HAVE GUNFIRE IN THE CABIN. YAAH! YAAH! [APPLAUSE] YEAH! THANKS. THAT'S A GOOD JOB. THANKS. Martin: YES, ELLIOTT, THAT WAS VERY COURAGEOUS OF YOU. I GUESS FEAR DOES WEIRD THINGS TO PEOPLE. I DON'T LIKE VIOLENCE. I DON'T LIKE BEING THREATENED. NO, OBVIOUSLY NOT. OBVIOUSLY, IT BROUGHT OUT THE BEST IN YOU. I NOTICED IN ALL THE CONFUSION THAT HE DROPPED THE DETONATOR. I ALSO NOTICED THAT YOU PICKED IT UP AND PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET. YOU OBSERVED A LOT FROM YOUR SEAT. YES, I DID. WHERE DID YOU PUT IT? WELL... I WOULDN'T DO THAT IF I WERE YOU. I NEED TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. ALLOW ME? UH-UH. BRITISH INTELLIGENCE? WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? TAKE A GOOD LOOK UNTIL YOU'RE SATISFIED. AND PUT THE GUN AWAY, WILL YOU? I THINK WE'VE ALL HAD QUITE ENOUGH OF THAT. WHAT IS GOING ON? HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH. THERE IS A TOXIN ON BOARD. IT'S A BINARY NERVE GAS. CAME OUT OF TURKMENISTAN. IT'S A LITTLE LEFTOVER FROM LESS STABLE DAYS. ONCE DETONATED, IT MIXES IN 15 SECONDS, AND EVERY LIVING THING IN A 5-MILE RADIUS DIES. SO YOU'RE-- YOU'RE THE ONE TAKING THESE GUYS OUT? TAKING EVERYBODY OUT? I AM UNDER ORDERS TO TRACK THESE FOUR AND RECOVER THE TOXIN. SO BY JOINING THE CLASS, THE AIRLINE LETS YOU ON THE PLANE A HALF-HOUR EARLY, AND YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE RESTRICTED AREAS. ACCESS TO THE ICE BINS. YES. VERY GOOD. SO YOU DOPED THE ENTIRE PLANE? IT'S A SIMPLE SPRAY. A TRANQUILIZER. EVERYBODY WILL BE AWAKE BY OUR ARRIVAL. THE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND, IS WHY GO AFTER THESE GUYS ON A PLANE? SEEMS LIKE AN AWFULLY CROWDED PLACE FOR AN ARREST, DOESN'T IT? IT'S THE ONLY PLACE THEY'RE VULNERABLE. IF YOU KNEW THE KIND OF ARTILLERY THESE BLOKES CARRY, YOU'D UNDERSTAND. NOW, I NEED TO SPEAK WITH THE CAPTAIN. [MAN SHOUTS IN CZECH] HE SAYS YOU'RE LYING. LOOK, I KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN UP FRONT WITH YOU, BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY. I THINK OUR CZECH FRIENDS HAVE SAID AND DONE ENOUGH. NOW, WOULDN'T YOU AGREE? [MAN SPEAKING CZECH] HE SAYS WE SHOULD TIE YOU UP, TOO, AND GIVE THAT TO THE PILOT. [MAN SPEAKING CZECH] OR ELSE WE'RE ALL DEAD. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY. LOOK, I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN. THIS MAN IS A TERRORIST. HE'S ALREADY HELD THE ENTIRE PLANE-- HELD ALL OF US HOSTAGE! ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH. I DON'T RECOGNIZE YOUR AUTHORITY ON THIS AIRCRAFT. I'M IN CONTROL HERE. NOW GIVE ME THE DETONATOR. [LAUGHS] NO, THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK. NOW! [PASSENGERS SCREAMING] OH, SHIT! [NO ACCENT] WELL, THAT SHUT YOU UP, DIDN'T IT? NOT THINKING ABOUT THE FLIGHT ANYMORE ARE YOU, MARTIN? [PASSENGERS SOBBING] SORRY. REALLY. ALL I NEEDED WERE THE LUGGAGE TAGS AND THE DETONATOR AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IT, YOU KNOW? THEY JUST WEREN'T THIRSTY ENOUGH, I GUESS. THEN THE WORLD'S GREATEST DAD HERE HAS TO PLAY JUNIOR DETECTIVE. ALL RIGHT, THE CABIN IS YOURS. BUT PLEASE TRY TO REMAIN SEATED WHILE THE SEAT BELT LIGHT IS ILLUMINATED. ANYBODY WHO DOESN'T... DIES. OH, AND THANKS FOR FLYING TRANS-CON. WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? I'M YOUR NEW BOSS. [THUNDER] IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED, HE'S TOASTING US ONE AT A TIME HERE. I SAY WE STAY PUT. NO. I TELL YOU, WE CAN STOP HIM. EVEN WITH A GUN. HE HAS CONTROL OF THE TOXIN, TOO. YEAH. OR DID YOU FORGET THAT? NO, NOT AT ALL. IN FACT, THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO ACT NOW. I THINK WE SHOULD WORRY ABOUT STAYING ALIVE UP HERE. LET THE POLICE OR THE FBI OR WHOEVER HANDLE IT. YOU'RE TRUSTING THE SITUATION IS GONNA GET BETTER. LOOK WHAT HE'S ALREADY DONE. HE'S UP IN THE COCKPIT RIGHT NOW, CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE ALL COWARDS. THIS MAY BE OUR ONLY CHANCE TO STOP HIM. THE ONLY HOPE, NOT JUST FOR US, BUT FOR A MILLION OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL. I'M IN. ME, TOO. ME, THREE. ALL RIGHT. LOOK, YOU KNOW, WE'VE ALREADY DUMPED FUEL. WE'VE GOT A HALF-HOUR LEFT IF WE'RE LUCKY. SEATTLE'S THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN. I'LL MAKE THAT DECISION IF YOU DON'T MIND. [LAUGHS] ALL RIGHT... YOU ARE GONNA HAVE A LITTLE QUIET TIME... WHILE I GO MAKE SOME NOISE. WELL, HOW'S EVERY LITTLE THING DOWN HERE? UNH. REMEMBER... JUST SIT BACK, RELAX. YOU KNOW THE DRILL. ELLIOTT? I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? WHAT? I'LL TAKE THAT. Man: IS EVERYBODY OK? OK, I GOT HIM COVERED. ALL RIGHT, GET UP. NOW! SLOWLY. [LAUGHS] Drake: WATCH IT. Man: JUST SHOOT HIM. NOW GET BACK! MOVE! SORRY ABOUT THAT. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? I WAS STARTING TO WONDER IF THEY HAD THE BALLS. THESE GUYS? BARELY. THE WOMEN MAYBE. Woman: OH, MY GOD! [SOBBING] [UNCOCKS GUN] UNH! [MARTIN GROANS] NICE TALKING TO YOU. KEEP AN EYE ON EVERYBODY. Man: NO PROBLEM. NOW YOU KNOW THE ONES TO WATCH. I'LL KEEP THEM IN LINE. AND STAY THERE! [SOBBING] [COCKPIT DOOR OPENS] UH... I NEED TO CHECK WITH SEATTLE. I NEED THE RADIO BACK ONLINE. UNACCEPTABLE. LOOK, WE HAVE NO CHOICE. SEATTLE HAS THE GROUND WARNING RADAR SYSTEM. SO UNLESS YOU WANT THOSE WINDSHEARS TO SLAM US INTO THE RUNWAY ON LANDING, YOU GOTTA DO WHAT I SAY. LOOK, I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING-- [GUNSHOTS] AAH! EXCUSE ME, I--I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM. LOOK, I'M NOT STUPID, LADY. COME ON. I'M NOT GONNA FALL FOR THAT. YOU CAN CONTROL THE PLANE, BUT NOT MY BLADDER. [WHISPERING] This is a passenger on Trans-Con flight 110. I need to reach Seattle Flight Control immediately. YOU CAN WATCH IF YOU WANT TO. FINE. JUST KEEP THE DOOR OPEN. This is an emergency. ARE YOU GONNA BEHAVE? YAAH! Yes, thank you. Would you please just connect me immediately? Harold: MARTIN. MARTIN! WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL? Woman: SEATTLE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. HOW CAN I HELP YOU? UNH! SON OF A... GET THE ICE! AAH! GET OFF ME! AAH! OPEN UP! THIS'LL HELP. SAY "AHH," YOU SON OF A BITCH! [GAGGING] SAY "AHH"! NOW! [GASPING] [THUNDER] HELLO, OPERATOR? YES, THIS IS A PASSENGER ON TRANS-CON FLIGHT 110. PLEASE LISTEN TO ME. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY. WE'VE BEEN TAKEN HOSTAGE. [CLICK] HELLO? [STATIC] SHIT! TRANS-CON 110 HEAVY, DO YOU COPY? OVER. WE HAVE HIM ON RADAR AND ON TRANSPONDER. TRACKING NORTH-NORTHWEST 3-3-0 NOW. HE'S STILL IN PATTERN. BUT WHY AREN'T THEY ANSWERING? WHAT TERRORISTS HAVE NO DEMANDS TO RADIO IN? CIRCLING, NO GAS, AND NO INTENTION TO LAND? I'D SAY A SUICIDAL ONE. [DIALING] GUESS WHO. YEAH, WE'RE STILL ON. YEAH. SHUT UP. SHUT UP. I NEED YOU TO LISTEN TO ME CAREFULLY. [SIGHS] HE KILLED THE PHONES. HE KNOWS THE PLANE. WE GOTTA FIND A WAY TO GET RID OF THOSE TOXINS. WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST? [SIGHS] I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IT WE CAN GET THE CLAIM TICKETS OFF THESE GUYS, WE CAN FIND THEIR BAGS AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DUMP THEM. IF IT LANDS IN THE OCEAN OR EVEN AN UNPOPULATED AREA, EVEN IF IT DETONATES, IT WON'T HURT ANYBODY. HOW ARE WE GONNA DUMP A BAG? THERE'S HUNDREDS OF BAGS. HOW ARE YOU GONNA FIND IT? HOW DO WE EVEN KNOW WHAT'S BELOW US? THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO GET AHOLD OF THE CONTROL TOWER. YOU SAID ALL THE PHONES WERE OUT. WELL, THEY ARE, BUT I HAVE AN IDEA. NOW, THERE'S A SECOND RADIO ACCESS POINT IN THE EQUIPMENT BAY. THE GROUND CREWS USE IT TO TALK TO THE TOWER. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. WON'T ELLIOTT HEAR THAT IN THE COCKPIT? YEAH, BUT MAYBE... WE CAN USE THE VOR AND SEND A SIGNAL TO THE GROUND THAT LETS THEM KNOW TO CHANGE THE RADIO FREQUENCY. MAYBE WE CAN BYPASS THE COCKPIT. I'M COMING WITH YOU. WHAT ARE OUR ASSETS SO FAR? Radio: THE SNIPERS WILL HAVE A CLEAR SIGHTLINE FROM THE TERMINAL. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON UP THERE? I DON'T KNOW. 110 IS UNRESPONSIVE TO HAILS. THAT LAST REPORT HAD GUNSHOTS ABOARD, BUT SHE'S CIRCLING STEADILY. [STATIC CRACKLING] WHAT IS THAT? Hobbs: IT'S STATIC. STORM'S INTERFERING WITH THE VOR SUBSYSTEM. [RHYTHMIC CRACKLING] THAT'S NOT THE STORM. IT SOUNDS TOO REGULAR FOR STATIC. IT'S LIKE A PATTERN. YOU'RE RIGHT. Sikes: MORSE CODE? SHORT, SHORT, SHORT, LONG, LONG, LONG, SHORT, SHORT, SHORT. THAT'S AN SOS. WRITE IT DOWN. RIGHT. [CLICKING] [HATCH DOOR CLOSES] HEY. HEY. I GOT THE CLAIM TICKETS. GREAT. GOOD JOB. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, RIGHT? YOU KIDDING ME? I DESIGN THESE THINGS FOR A LIVING. NO. I MEAN THE MORSE CODE. YEAH, WELL, I THINK SO. GOT A BUDDY THROUGH A FEW FINALS WITH IT. "A" IS A DOT-DASH. A TAP OF THE FOOT, THEN A DRAG. YOU USED IT TO CHEAT ON TESTS? I DIDN'T CHEAT. HE CHEATED. I JUST TAPPED MY FOOT. MUST HAVE BEEN A GOOD FRIEND. NO, NOT REALLY, BUT HE HAD A CUTE SISTER. I SEE. YOU JUST USED IT TO GET A DATE. BETTER THAN THAT. I MARRIED HER. THAT WAS OUR SON TREVOR YOU SAW BACK AT THE AIRPORT. FOR SOME REASON I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE MARRIED. I'M NOT ANYMORE. MY WIFE DIED RIGHT AFTER TREVOR WAS BORN. "TRUNS-COP 1-1-0 TO SEUGO FRED 2-2-1." WHAT THE HELL IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? THEIR RADIO MUST BE OUT. WHY ELSE WOULD THEY BE SENDING MORSE CODE ON THE VOR SYSTEM? UM, F-R-E-D. MAYBE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE F-R-E-Q. FREQUENCY 221. "GO FREQUENCY 221." GET ON 221. SEE IF YOU CAN PICK ANYTHING UP. YOU GOT IT. [TAPS KEYBOARD] SHE WAS THE PASSENGER THAT DIED IN THAT PLANE CRASH. YEAH. YEAH. I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD FLY AGAIN, BUT AT LEAST MAYBE I CAN MAKE IT SAFER FOR THOSE WHO DID. WANT TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE HATCH? YEAH. [FLIPS SWITCHES] TESTING, 1, 2, 3. Martin: DO YOU READ ME? WHAT WAS THAT? THIS IS TRANS-CON 110. DO YOU COPY? TRANS-CON 100 HEAVY. WE READ YOU LOUD AND CLEAR. WHAT IS YOUR STATUS? WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY. WHERE'S THE CAPTAIN? WE DON'T KNOW. WE THINK HE MIGHT'VE BEEN KILLED. UM... MY NAME IS MARTIN MESSERMAN. I'M WITH THE FEAR OF FLYING GROUP. YOU--YOU MIGHT REMEMBER ME. I'M THE ONE WHO PASSED OUT IN THE CONTROL TOWER. OH, RIGHT. I REMEMBER. WELL, WE'VE BEEN HIJACKED, AND THERE IS A CHEMICAL WEAPON ON BOARD. WE ARE AWARE OF THE HIJACK SITUATION. WHAT, UH... WHAT TYPE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS ARE WE DEALING WITH HERE? Martin: IT'S SOME KIND OF GAS. I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS, BUT HE SAID THAT IT WOULD KILL EVERYTHING WITHIN A 5-MILE RADIUS. IT'S IN THE CARGO BAY IN--IN ONE OF THE PIECES OF LUGGAGE. WE DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE. WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO GET IT OFF THE PLANE. Sikes: ALL RIGHT, MARTIN, ALL RIGHT. YOU JUST STAND BY. GET FIELD OPS ON THE LINE. NOTIFY THE DIRECTOR. TELL HIM ABOUT THE SITUATION, PRIORITY ALPHA. WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP YOU. THANK YOU. I'M GOING TO NEED A FEW OTHER THINGS FROM UPSTAIRS. OK. LOOK, I'M THE ONE WHO FOUND OUT ABOUT THESE GUYS, AND I'M THE ONE WHO HAD THE BALLS AND THE BRAINS TO SNAG THEIR PRECIOUS PACKAGE, SO YOU JUST HANDLE YOUR END, OK? OHH! SORRY. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? UM, WE NEED DETERGENT AND DESSERT GELATIN. OH, AND WE NEED RALPH'S NITRO PILLS. I'LL GET THOSE. OH, I NEED YOUR CIGARETTES-- ALL OF THEM. HERE, YOU MIGHT AS WELL TAKE THE LIGHTER. THANKS. SORRY. Sikes: NOW, IF THEY WERE THE LAST TO BOARD, THE TOXIN WOULD PROBABLY BE IN ONE OF THE FIRST THREE BINS ON THE PORT SIDE. 3 BINS. COPY THAT. WE HAVE YOU AT 15,000 FEET OVER WASHINGTON COASTLINE, APPROACHING A LARGE BODY OF WATER CALLED GRAY'S HARBOR. IN ABOUT 7 OR 8 MINUTES, YOU'LL BE OVER IT. IF HE MAINTAINS SAME COURSE AND SPEED, YOU'LL HAVE A 3-MINUTE WINDOW BY WHICH TO DUMP THE CONTAINER BEFORE HITTING POPULATED LAND. REMEMBER THIS-- YOU MUST DROP IT OVER WATER. THEY'RE GOING TO DOWN THE PLANE IF IT MOVES INLAND WITH CHEMICALS ON BOARD. WHAT WAS THAT, SEATTLE? COULD YOU PLEASE REPEAT? DID YOU SAY DOWN THE PLANE? PLEASE CONFIRM. THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. THERE ARE INNOCENT PEOPLE ON BOARD THIS PLANE. WE CAN'T EVACUATE EVERYONE IN TIME. WE'RE TALKING A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE ON THAT FLIGHT PATH. WE HAVE TO ACT NOW. YOU'LL GUARANTEE AUTHORIZATION? I MEAN, ROCK-SOLID, STAND BY IT ALL THE WAY? THE PRESS, THE INVESTIGATION, THE WORKS? BECAUSE THE FAA'S NOT GOING TO DESTROY A PLANELOAD OF INNOCENT PASSENGERS UNLESS YOU GUYS TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY. WE'VE CONFIRMED THE IDENTITIES. CZECH INTELLIGENCE HAS ALSO CONFIRMED THE THEFT OF A TYPE ONE VIRAL DISPERSION DEVICE APPROXIMATELY 2 WEEKS AGO, AND THEY CONCUR ON THE TRAIL TO FLIGHT 110. BUT DON'T WORRY. THIS IS ON FBI DIRECTOR AUTHORITY ALONE. Man: UM... I'VE GOT BREMERTON NAVAL AIR STATION. THEY'RE TRACKING, BUT THEY WANT SECONDARY AUTHORIZATION FROM FAA. LET ME TALK TO THEM. Sikes: MARTIN, LISTEN. THEY ARE PREPARED TO SHOOT YOU DOWN IF YOU MOVE OVER ANY POPULATED AREAS. THIS IS BEYOND MY CONTROL. MY GOD, THIS IS CRAZY. YOU CAN DO IT. BELIEVE ME, I KNOW YOU CAN. OK... UNDERSTOOD. WHAT ABOUT THE BIN NUMBERS? HANG ON. Sikes: WE'RE TRYING TO MATCH THEM NOW. HOLD ON. YOU GOT A PEN? YEAH. ALL RIGHT, HERE GOES. BIN NUMBER A-4-5-- HELLO? HELLO, SEA-TAC CONTROL, DO YOU READ ME? Martin: YOU GOT THAT CIGARETTE? YEAH. HAROLD MADE A BIG SACRIFICE. HE PROBABLY NEEDS A NICOTINE PATCH THE SIZE OF NEBRASKA RIGHT ABOUT NOW. WELL, THANK GOD FOR THE TOBACCO COMPANIES. THIS IS ONE BAD HABIT THAT'S GOING TO SAVE OUR LIVES. HERE YOU GO. OK, STEP BACK. [PEOPLE SCREAM] OH, GOD. UHH! UHH! UHH! CHECK THAT FIRST BIN FOR A-4-5. HERE. THIS ONE SAYS A-4-5. SO DOES THIS ONE. GREAT. THIS ONE DOES, TOO. SHIT. WITHOUT THE REST OF THE NUMBER, IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE TRYING TO FIND A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK. WE GOT TO FIND A WAY TO CONTACT THEM AGAIN. WHAT? WE DON'T HAVE TIME, AND THE PHONES ARE OUT, AND SO IS THE RADIO. SHIT. IF WE JUST HAD A... WAIT A MINUTE. A CELL PHONE? THAT DON'T WORK ON A PLANE. I GOT AN IDEA. WHAT? WAIT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. DOESN'T A CELL PHONE INTERFERE WITH THE NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM? NO, IT DOESN'T. IT WORKS OVER LAND CELL SITES UP TO 10,000 FEET. WELL, THEN WHY DO THEY TELL YOU NOT TO USE THEM? BECAUSE THEY WANT YOU TO USE THEIR PHONES. WHY? WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? ABOUT 3 BUCKS A MINUTE. I'M GOING TO, UH... USE THE SPOILER... TRY TO GET US LOWER WHERE THE CELL PHONES ARE WORKING. OK. WE NEED TO GET TO 10,000 FEET ANYWAY TO OPEN THE BAY DOORS. OTHERWISE, WE'LL BE SUCKED OUT BY THE DECOMPRESSION. [ALARM BEEPING] SHIT. GREAT. I'VE GOT A SIGNAL. COME ON. YES. IN SEATTLE, SEA-TAC AIRPORT, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL. YOU'RE CALLING INFORMATION? YEAH. COULD YOU HOLD THIS? HELLO? [STRAINS] [SCREAMING] WHOA, GOD. DAMN IT, NOW WHAT? PRESSURE. IF IT CROSSES THE COASTLINE AND THAT SARIN GAS DETONATES, WE'RE LOOKING AT A CATASTROPHE. WE'RE LOOKING AT ONE EITHER WAY. A 747 JETLINER-- MY GOD. SIR, THERE'S SOMEONE ON THE LINE CLAIMING THEY'RE ON THE TRANS-CON FLIGHT. WELL, PUT HIM THROUGH. UHH! AAH! WHAT IS IT WITH YOU PEOPLE? GOD! Sikes: 1-1-4. COPY. A-4-5-1-1-4. OK, WE'RE LOOKING. STAND BY. I GOT IT. WHERE SHOULD WE MOVE IT? PUSH IT OUT OF THE WAY. WHAT? NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. SHE'S FINE. YOU'RE COMFORTABLE, RIGHT? NICE FASHION STATEMENT. YOU LOOK LIKE A DUCK. I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO STAY PUT! NOW, DO YOU WANT TO DIE? HUH? NO! HUH? ALL YOU BASKET CASES! DO YOU WANT TO DIE? THIS ONE DOESN'T HAVE A TAG ON IT. LOOK. OPEN IT UP. Jessica: WHAT'S THIS? THAT'S NOT IT. IT'S A LOCATOR. GPS BACKPACKING EQUIPMENT. KEEP LOOKING. TRANS-CON 110... I MEAN, MARTIN, YOU HAVE LESS THAN 2 MINUTES BEFORE YOU HIT LAND. CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU HAVE THE TOXIN? SHIT. BREMERTON, PLEASE STAND BY. HERE IT IS. LOOK. UHH! OPEN THIS DOOR! OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR, OR EVERYBODY DIES! AAH! Martin: GET DOWN! GET DOWN. PUSH! PUSH! AAH! AAH! [GUNSHOTS] [CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK] DAMN IT! COME ON! OUR RADAR SHOWS THEY CROSSED OVER GRAY'S HARBOR, AND WE HAVE NO CONFIRMATION THE TOXIN HAS BEEN DROPPED. [BEEPING] DAMN IT! THIS FLIGHT IS GETTING EXPENSIVE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET A SIGNAL AGAIN UNTIL WE'RE OVER LAND. BREMERTON... YOU ARE GO FOR LAUNCH. I REPEAT--YOU ARE GO FOR LAUNCH. THE RADAR'S LOCKED. MISSILE BATTERY LAUNCHING. GOD HELP US. HERE, CATCH. Man: OH, MY GOD! DON'T DROP IT! OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE. WELL, YOUR BRAVE EXPEDITION PARTY JUST HAD THEMSELVES AN ANTHRAX COCKTAIL IN THE LOUNGE BELOW. NOW, I SEALED THE LOWER DECK, SO IF WE'RE LUCKY, THE WIND DOWNSTAIRS MIGHT SAVE US. IF NOT, THESE MARGARINE CUPS WON'T HELP ANY. SO, GIVEN THAT UNFORTUNATE LOSS, I'M FORCED TO IMPROVISE, AND I'M IN A REALLY... BAD MOOD. SEA-TAC? IT'S FLIGHT 110. I'VE GOT HIM. 110, WE CONFIRM YOU HAVE DROPPED OVER WATER. BREMERTON, BELAY THAT ORDER. BREMERTON, DO NOT LAUNCH. I REPEAT-- DO NOT LAUNCH. SIR, THE MISSILES ARE ALREADY AWAY. WE HAVE THEM LOCKED ON AND TRACKING TO THE TARGET. SEATTLE, IT'S GONE. HELLO? HELLO, SEATTLE? [CELL PHONE BEEPS] SHIT. WE LOST THE SIGNAL. ABORT THE MISSILES. I REPEAT-- ABORT AND SELF-DESTRUCT. ROGER. SENDING ABORT SEQUENCE NOW. [BEEPING] Elliott: WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT THAT YOU FREQUENT CRIERS WOULD BE MY BEST TICKET OUT OF THIS MESS? I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FETCH, BUT WE'LL SEE. FIRST, THOUGH, I NEED... A VOLUNTEER FOR A PATRIOTIC MISSION. DAMN! HE MUST'VE LOCKED IT. OH, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? [SIGHS] FOLLOW ME. COME ON. I--I CAN'T GO IN THERE. JUST PRETEND IT'S ONE OF THE EXERCISES IN CLASS. I CAN'T. COME ON. I'LL BE RIGHT NEXT TO YOU. WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. IT'S OK. COME ON, NOW, THIS IS GOING TO BE FUN! ALL RIGHT, NO VOLUNTEERS? LET'S TAKE A VOTE. WHO'S THE BIGGEST PAIN IN THE ASS ON THIS FLIGHT? HERE, CONTESTANT NUMBER ONE. RIGHT HERE. COME ON, PEOPLE, I WANT TO SEE SOME HANDS. COME ON, COME ON, COME ON, COME ON! HANDS! IF YOU DON'T VOTE, YOU DIE! [LAUGHS] WHAT'D YOU DO TO HIM? ALL RIGHT, HOW ABOUT OUR TEACHER? RIGHT HERE. HOW ABOUT HER? HOW ABOUT THEM RIGHT HERE? HER? HIM, HER? DUCK, DUCK, GOOSE? PEOPLE, COME ON. YOU ARE ALL REGISTERED TO VOTE. HOW ABOUT HER? HOW ABOUT HIM RIGHT HERE? YOU'RE--YOU'RE A LAWYER, RIGHT? HOW ABOUT THE LAWYER? ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SEEING ANY HANDS. NOW, I KNOW YOU HATE THIS GUY! YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FLIP FOR IT. OK, HERE WE GO. HEADS, IT'S THE TAXMAN. TAILS, ONE LESS LITIGATOR. OH, NO. DAMN. IT'S LOCKED. [GASPING] IT'S TAILS. YOU KNOW WHAT? THESE MOTHERFUCKERS HAVE AUDITED ME FOR THE PAST 2 YEARS. [WHIMPERS] NO. I'M JUST FUCKING WITH YOU. OK, LET'S GO. WHAT IS-- COME ON, GO UPSTAIRS. LET'S GO. LISTEN, I CAN NEGOTIATE FOR YOU ON THE GROUND. GOOD. UP. NO, WAIT! WELL... IF IT ISN'T THE MOUSEKETEERS. I GOT TO SAY, I'M IMPRESSED. OHH! WELL, COUNSELOR... I GUESS THIS IS YOUR LUCKY DAY. IF YOU KILL ME, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO LAND THE PLANE. YOU SHOT THE ILS SYSTEM. GO AHEAD. LOOK. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? AUTOPILOT CAN'T LAND THE PLANE WITHOUT AN ILS LINE TO FOLLOW. IT WON'T KNOW OUR POSITION RELATIVE TO THE GROUND UNTIL WE SMASH INTO IT ANYWAY. IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANY CHANCE AT ALL, YOU NEED ME ALIVE. I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS A SHOT AT LANDING THIS PLANE. YOU? MR. FEARFUL FLYER? WITHOUT AN ILS LINE, IN LOW VISIBILITY, WITH 15 MINUTES OF FUEL? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE THAT? IN THE BAGGAGE AREA, WE FOUND A GPS. IT'S A GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM. WITH IT, WE CAN FIX OUR POSITION ALL THE WAY TO THE GROUND. YOU NEED ME... AND NOT JUST TO RIG THE EQUIPMENT. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO PROGRAM THE AUTOPILOT, BUT FLYING THE PLANE SOLO AND LANDING IT, THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT BALL GAME ALL TOGETHER. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO. Elliott: GO. IT'S OK. [GASPS] [BEEPS] Jessica: FOUND IT. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. HERE. PUT THIS UP TO THE PC CONNECTOR. IT'S THERE ON THE FLOOR. OK. [LINE RINGING] Martin: ALL RIGHT. GOOD. WE'RE ACQUIRING SATELLITES. IT'S ME. GOT A PEN? YEAH. UH-HUH. OK, I GOT IT. OK. HERE GOES. I'M GOING TO NEED TO LAND MANUALLY, AND I'LL NEED ACCESS TO THE RADIO TO MAKE SURE AIR TRAFFIC IS CLEAR. ALL RIGHT, FINE, BUT IF YOU TRY ANYTHING, SHE DIES. WHAT IS THIS ALL FOR? MONEY. IT MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND. SO YOU JUST WANTED TO SELL IT? NO. WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN USING IT. IN THE RIGHT PLACE, AT THE RIGHT TIME, A GOOD, SOLID TERRORIST THREAT IS MUCH MORE FINANCIALLY REWARDING. ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD. TRANS-CON 110 TO SEATTLE CENTER, OVER. Sikes: SEATTLE CENTER. GO AHEAD. THIS IS MARTIN. I HAVE AN UPDATE FOR YOU. I'M NOW AT THE WHEEL. I'M GOING TO NEED A LITTLE HELP. THE HIJACKER IS HERE WITH ME, AND I'M COMING IN TO LAND. TELL THEM YOU WANT TO REFUEL. WE WANT TO REFUEL. NO POLICE, NO ARMED PERSONNEL. YOU WILL AWAIT FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. NO POLICE, NO ARMED PERSONNEL. AWAIT FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. I CAN KEEP THE POLICE BACK, BUT I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE WEATHER. ARE YOU ORDERING MY MEN BACK ON FAA AUTHORITY? WELL, I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER WAY AROUND IT. YOU WANT MORE PEOPLE TO DIE? IF I HAVE TO PULL RANK ON YOU, I WILL. I'M NOT LETTING SOME MADMAN CALL THE SHOTS. GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT HE HAS PLANNED. YOU KEEP YOUR MEN IN POSITION AND BOARD THAT PLANE THE FIRST CHANCE YOU GET. [ALARM BEEPING] WHAT'S THAT? IT'S A FUEL WARNING. WE ONLY HAVE 2,000 POUNDS LEFT. IT'S ENOUGH FOR ABOUT 5 OR 10 MINUTES. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THIS WORK ON THE FIRST APPROACH. NO. I WANT YOU TO PASS OVER THE AIRSTRIP FIRST. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FUEL FOR THAT. YES, WE DO. YOU'LL DO AS I SAY. OR WHAT? IF WE TRY A FLYOVER, WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE WHEN WE UNDERSHOOT THE LANDING. YES, BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT US ANYMORE, MARTY. [CELL PHONE RINGS] [RINGS] HERE. I THINK IT'S FOR YOU. HELLO? [PEOPLE YELLING] TREVOR? SON OF A BITCH. ALL RIGHT, LINE IT UP FOR THE FLYOVER. YOU'RE INSANE. THE FUEL'S JUST-- I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE FUCKING FUEL! NOW I WANT TO DROP THEM A MESSAGE. OW! WHERE ARE YOU-- JESSICA! STAY THERE. WELL, SINCE YOUR BOYFRIEND ALREADY HAS HIS HANDS OCCUPIED, WE SHOULD PROBABLY KEEP YOUR HANDS OCCUPIED, TOO. WHY DON'T YOU SHOOT ME? COME ON. I THINK YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT ONE. WE GOT SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS. [LAUGHS] ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. OH, GOD! PLEASE DON'T HURT ME! COME ON. GO, GO, GO. FOR GOD'S SAKES, HAVEN'T YOU DONE ENOUGH ALREADY? SHUT UP! [PEOPLE GASP] GOD, I'M JUST SICK OF YOU! YOU-- GO! COME ON, MOVE! [CRYING] LOOK... WAIT! AAH! YOU'RE KIDDING ME, RIGHT? [SCREAMING] YOU'RE JUST FUCKING WITH ME LIKE YOU WERE BEFORE, AREN'T YOU? OW! GOD! AAH! OH, MY GOD! DID YOU SAY YOU'D NEGOTIATE FOR ME ON THE GROUND? YES! YES! ABSOLUTELY! GOOD! NO! PUT IN A GOOD WORD FOR ME! AAH! AAH! OHH! OHH! [PEOPLE SCREAMING] [AIRPLANE] WHAT IN THE HELL IS GOING ON BACK THERE? WELL... REMEMBER HOW I SAID WHATEVER DOESN'T KILL US ONLY MAKES US STRONGER? HEH. WELL, LET'S JUST SAY WILCOX... WON'T BE GETTING ANY STRONGER. ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD. PUT THEM BACK ON. Martin: SEA-TAC CONTROL, THIS IS MARTIN. HE SAYS THAT'S A WARNING-- THAT IF YOU DON'T COMPLY WITH ALL OF HIS DEMANDS, THE REST OF THE PASSENGERS WILL BE LANDING THE SAME WAY. [SIRENS] I'M HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE STABILIZING THIS THING. I'VE GOT THE FLAPS SET TO FULL, THE THROTTLE AT ONE THIRD. YOU SEEM TO KNOW THE PLANE WELL ENOUGH. THAT'S HALF THE BATTLE. NOW EASE OFF ON THE AILERON. LET HER SETTLE. THERE'S A CROSS WIND OF 20 KNOTS. IN ORDER TO COUNTER THE YAW, YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE RIGHT RUDDER. ROGER THAT. COUNTERING. MY SPEED AND MY ANGLE ARE WAY OFF. Sikes: TAKE IT EASY, MARTIN. TAKE IT EASY. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO THIS. YOU'RE DOING JUST FINE. YOU'RE GOING TO LAND THIS BABY. NOW LISTEN TO ME. THE ILS SHOWS 2 LINES. WHEN THEY CENTER UP ON THE SCREEN IN A PERFECT CROSS, THAT INDICATES THE PROPER GLIDE SLOPE. ROGER, SEA-TAC. Computer: WARNING-- LOW FUEL. WARNING--LOW FUEL. SHIT. THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE ENGINE. THE NUMBER ONE ENGINE IS DOWN. I DON'T KNOW THE RESTART PROCEDURE. YOU HAVE TO PURGE THE LINE BY THROTTLING UP ONLY THE NUMBER ONE ENGINE AND THEN HIT RESTART. ROGER THAT. [SIRENS] [BEEPS] WE'RE OUT OF FUEL. WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. THE NUMBER 4 ENGINE IS NOW GONE AS WELL. Man: OH, MY GOD! WE'RE GOING TO DIE! [PEOPLE SCREAMING] OH, GOD, HE'S COMING IN TOO LOW. YOU'VE GOT TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LOWER VELOCITY. PULL UP. PULL UP, MARTIN. PULL UP. THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. REVERSE ENGINES. YOU'RE DOWN. YOU'RE DOWN. Martin: REVERSING THRUST, BUT ENGINES ONE AND FOUR ARE STILL OUT. WE'RE NOT STOPPING. LOOKS LIKE 300 FEET-- YOU'LL HAVE TO LEAN ON THE HYDRAULICS. THAT'S IT! WHOO! THAT'S IT. JAM ON THOSE BRAKES. Man: WHOO! OH, I WISH I HAD A CIGARETTE. I TOOK THIS OFF OF LENNY. HIT THE WHEEL BRAKES. [APPLAUSE] Woman: YES! Man: TEAM "A" IS MOVING INTO POSITION. LET'S GO! LET'S GO! SNIPERS WILL HAVE A CLEAR HIT ON THE PLANE. Martin: THE HIJACKER IS SENDING OUT 2 WOUNDED HOSTAGES IN EXCHANGE FOR FUEL. Man: LET'S GO! LET'S GO! JUST MAKE SURE THE 2 HOSTAGES ARE CLEAR FIRST. Man: ROGER THAT. [SIREN] TEAM "B," MOVE INTO POSITION. GET READY TO FIRE ON MY MARK. WE HAVE ALL THE ANGLES PINNED DOWN. Man: ROGER THAT. WE'RE TRAINED ON THE DOOR. NOBODY IS GOING ANYWHERE. WE HAVE MOVEMENT. REPEAT--WE HAVE MOVEMENT. STAY BACK! HE SAID STAY BACK! OH, GOD. HE'S INSANE. HE'S SPEAKING IN SOME FOREIGN LANGUAGE. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD HE'S SAYING. WELL, ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY. [BEEPS] YOU DON'T REALLY THINK YOU CAN JUST WALK OUT OF HERE, DO YOU? WE'RE ALREADY HALFWAY HOME. SIR? YOU BETTER LISTEN TO THIS. Sikes: JUST PUT IT ON THE SPEAKER PHONE. SHUT UP AND JUST KEEP MOVING. Martin: YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET AWAY WITH THIS. [LAUGHS] JUST WATCH ME. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH MY SON? HE'LL BE FINE RIGHT THERE IN THE TERMINAL AS LONG AS YOU PLAY IT COOL. NICE, MARTIN, VERY NICE. TACTICAL, LISTEN CLOSELY. ROGER. CAUCASIAN MALE WITH TAN OVERCOAT. REPEAT-- WITH A CHILD? IT'S ALL RIGHT. HEY. HEY! Trevor: DADDY! Man: I SAID COME BACK! DAMN IT! THERE! DROP HIM! [GUNSHOTS] [SIREN] TREVOR! TREVOR! DADDY! HEY! NO! BYE-BYE, MARTY. STOP! [BRAKES SQUEAL] [SIREN STOPS] Driver: OH, MY GOD. JAY, I'VE BEEN SHOT. WHATEVER DOESN'T KILL US ONLY MAKES US STRONGER. TREVOR! DAD! ARE YOU TWO OK? YEAH. Trevor: I WAS SO SCARED. IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO, LET'S GO. MOVE IT OUT, MOVE IT OUT. YOU OK, PAL? YEAH. IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT NOW. OH, I LOVE YOU. COME ON. WE'RE GOING HOME. HELLO? WE SHOULD FLY MORE OFTEN. HELLO? HOLD YOUR FIRE. IS IT OVER? IS HE GONE? [COUGHS] MARTIN? MARTIN MESSERMAN? I'M ROBERT SIKES, SEATTLE ATC. I'M THE GUY YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO. GOD, CONGRATULATIONS. YOU DID AN INCREDIBLE JOB. THANKS. THANKS A LOT. DO ME A FAVOR, WOULD YOU? THE NEXT TIME YOU LAND A PLANE ON MY STRIP, BONE UP ON YOUR MORSE CODE. [LAUGHS] WELL, IT WAS A PLEASURE MEETING YOU. YOU, TOO. THANKS. Jessica: MARTIN! MARTIN. OH, MY GOD, YOU DID IT. GO, DAD. SORRY. TREVOR... THIS IS MY GOOD FRIEND JESSICA. MY VERY GOOD FRIEND. YOU REALLY LANDED THE PLANE BY YOURSELF? WERE YOU SCARED? HEY, IS YOUR DAD SCARED OF ANYTHING? HUH? CAN WE GIVE YOU A RIDE HOME? YEAH. COME ON. CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY TRIMARK HOME VIDEO
