There are many of them, ten miles away from us! Scramble all our fighters. Now! Sir, the CBD has been hit! Reports coming in fast that Marina Bay area has also been hit. What on earth? -What happened? -That was loud. After the MRT incident, what now? Someone is going to get into trouble again. Why? What happened? I think it's going to be something major. -Yes. -Yes. My goodness. That's really major. That's terrible. Hornet, engage enemy on sight! Roger, will take them out! This is an emergency broadcast. Bedok and Yio Chu Kang have come under attack. The police and the civil defence force have been deployed to deal with the situation. I'm sorry. We interrupt this broadcast with an emergency message from the Prime Minister. Fellow Singaporeans. We're now under attack by an unknown enemy force. This is not an exercise. I want all of you to please remain calm. And proceed to the nearest bomb shelter to take cover. I assure you. We will survive this together. So go now. So much stuff! -How can we squeeze in? -I told you. This is a bomb shelter and not a storeroom. The government told us to take cover. Better do it or get fined. -Hurry up! -Go on! -Hurry! -Take this! This bomb shelter is so small. Even if we don't die from a bomb, we'll die from suffocation. How can they design such a small bomb shelter? Mom, can I go to the toilet? You must be crazy. But can I at least fart? Hornet 2, tally single enemy aircraft. Three o'clock low. Hornet 1 is engaged. Roger, watching your six. Fox 2, in five. Enemy splashed. Hornet 1, watch your front! Roger, under control. Going to war. Is it bullshit or is it real? Don't worry. We can probably leave after we sign in. No. This time, it's for real. Shit. My show business is over. What are you talking about? Even Singapore's future may be over. Quick, draw a gun! I heard that Jurong has been bombed. Really? I heard Punggol too. It's all over, man. No more shopping. Actually, who's our enemy? Alpha One Niner, this is Sunray. Proceed to secure objective Lily White One, Charlie, and Delta, over. Sunray, this is Alpha One Niner. Roger orders to secure objective Lily White One, Charlie, and Delta, over. I heard the two integrated resorts have been bombed. Can't try our luck there anymore. It's a target not only for the enemy, but also for those who lost money. Please take care of me during battle. This is the real thing, not a game. You're on your own. Sir, unknown vessel bearing 341 range five. Zero nautical miles, approaching fast. Hello, Charlie Niner, this is Sunray. Redeploy to Sector Omega to reinforce Bravo Two, out. Sunray, this is Charlie Niner. Encountered obstacle along Robinson Road. Permission to proceed to Sector Omega on foot, over.

Don't look! Buddy, we came together, we'll leave together. Hang in there! Don't look. Hang in there! Clear! Grenade! Game over. Yes, I won. Yes! -Very good. -This is called technique, okay? Always using the old uncle as the hero. That's my uncle, okay? But there are younger ones. Dear, with such good skills, I'm sure you can go to OCS and become an officer. Why don't you delay your studies? Wait for me. My parents won't allow it. We have quarreled over this many times before. Your parents. -Can you please grow up? -Dear, stop it, okay? I'll email you every day from there. What's the point? I don't even know if I have access to the Internet over there. Can you please stop behaving like a kid? You're going to be a soldier and protect our country soon. Don't be so childish, okay? What did you say? Are you saying I'm childish? Are you saying I'm childish? I'll show you. You said I'm childish, right? Dear, come back! It's very dangerous! -Is this childish enough for you? -Come back! It's very dangerous! Never mind, everyone can see. Come and see how childish I am. Are you happy now? Shit army. Hey, stop! Shit army! -Stop! What are you doing? -Shit army! What are you doing? Sorry. Give me your identity card. I'm sorry, sir. I won't do it again. No excuses, give me your identity card. Sorry, but you'll have to come to the station with me. Kicking the trash can to vent your frustration. You're a trash can too. Why kick yourself? Ken, you think by throwing a tantrum, the whole world will be scared and give in to you? If you continue to cause trouble, I am fully prepared to visit you in jail one day. Darling, are you okay? Hey, you're his dad. How could you talk to your son this way? You're hurting his feelings. Just look at him. How could he survive in the army? I have only one grandson. You have to think of a way to stop him from getting enlisted. Mom, I'm not the Minister for Defence. Even the Prime Minister's son has to serve in the army. Ken is the way he is because you two spoilt him. -No, we didn't. -No, we didn't. -You're full of nonsense. -Yes. Later, when we go inside, please don't say anything. Just keep quiet. Let me do all the talking. You just act like you are very sick. Can you find it? Ken Chow. Chow Jun Jie, try that. My son is going to serve National Service in two weeks' time. I heard that those who are flat-footed do not have to serve in the army. Am I right? My son also has flat feet and he did his National Service. But does your son have smelly feet, sweaty feet or Hong Kong feet? My son has hei goo. -"Hei goo"? -Hei goo! -Hei goo... -Asthma. Yes, asthma. You are a doctor. You know asthma is very fatal, right? On top of that, my son also has nose bleed, tongue bleed, chest bleed, stomach pain, backside pain, arthritis, bronchitis, -hemorrhage, osteoarthritis-- -Excuse me. Is your son still alive? Don't you jinx him! Of course he's still alive. He is just sick today. He is very healthy. He's very fit, I'm telling you. That stupid Caucasian doctor. I said so much and he still refused to write your report for National Service. They told me to go to Orchard Road. Look for a high-class Caucasian doctor. They said I could get the report. Three hundred eighty-three dollars and fifty cents. Report, my foot! If I had known, I would have gone to Toa Payoh where the doctor would just sign whatever report I write. That doctor is very good. Why don't we go now? We can't. He's already in jail. Then what can we do? I don't want to go to the National Service. -I know. -Mary. -Hey. -Uncle. -Ken, what are you doing here? -Hello. Where are you going? I brought him to a doctor to get a report for exemption to the NS. Hey, you were a storeman. You could teach him a thing or two on how to avoid being an infantry. As the saying goes, "You won't be excused unless you pretend." I was only paid 90 dollars monthly as a recruit. The corporals would scream at us. They insulted us from our dads to our ancestors. I had no choice, but to think of an excuse. I stayed under the radar as much as I could until I became a storeman. It was an 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. job, plus I could stay out. I could earn extra money. Selling durians got me more than 2,000 dollars a month. Ninety dollars is not even enough to pay for a prostitute. Don't say that. But you still had to serve in the army. How could I skip that altogether? You're really too much! But of course there are ways. Say you had chicken pox for two years. To be honest, there used to be this nutcase in our company. He was amazing when he faked being sick. Even the army gave up on him. He kept searching for something and didn't care about anything else. Day and night, he searched not only his own cabinet, but the bed of others as well. He really messed things up. When we asked him what's he's looking for, he just wouldn't tell. Everyone in the section was so annoyed with him. Yet nobody knew what he lost. Even after the officers gave him extra duty, charged him, and sent him to guard room duty, nothing worked. So they sent him to the medical center and let the MO examine him to see what could be done. But he found nothing wrong. So he was sent to a specialist and was prescribed lots of medicine. Once he returned, things got worse. He not only searched the bunks, but the whole Company. He searched everywhere. Later, he even searched the batallion's parade square. The OC thought he was a gone case. He was sent back to the medical center. The MO then referred him to the Medical Board. The Medical Board deemed him unfit for National Service. As part of his discharge procedure, he was required to return his green army identity card. The chief clerk then returned him his document. -Sign here, please. -The Chief Clerk later told us, once he got his identity card back, he was all smiles. And he said merrily, "Just what I've been looking for. My red identity card!" Excuse me, do you have any package for army boys? Yes, we do have a youth package. Let's get this plan. It's especially for army guys. Remember the mobile phone that you bring -can't have camera functions. -Is that so? Sir, may I have your identity card, please? Darling, my colleagues were army officers. Can you please tell my son how to get into OCS? I think most importantly, you need to show your leadership skills at all times. In all situations, you must know what to do when you encounter problems. Leadership qualities. Be positive. It plays an important part as well. Positive mindset. Score well on all your tests. You must also be very knowledgeable. Okay. Be helpful to others so that others can help you. -It's a two-way traffic. -"Helpful." You hear that? That's not too difficult, right? Sure. Thank you, guys, for all your kind advice. Sir, please sign here. Mrs. Ching, I think you need to bring him for a haircut first. You're right. You need to show the commanders that you're ready for BMT. Yes. I want to give you my virginity. Why? You want to claim me for yourself? Yes. We've been dating for three months, but we haven't done anything. You are always thinking of this kind of thing. My mom says I can only do this after marriage. Your mom doesn't know anything. Look, I'm going to the army soon. And I heard the training is very dangerous. What if I die during training? Then, I will not have the chance to have sex. If I go to heaven, the angels will surely laugh at me. What are you doing? I don't want to do it. No, I don't want to. Boy. Mom! What are you two doing? Can't you see I'm busy? Why did you barge in? Do you want some bananas? This can wait. Okay. Shut up, okay? What a stupid door. It can't be locked. I love the door because it can't be locked. So good. Stupid old lady. -She's very cute. -No, she's stupid! Don't you have a friend who is some big shot in the army? I heard he is a high-ranking officer. Can't you get him to help? Let's drop the subject, okay? Don't you worry about these young people. Let's have dinner. Hey, it's mine. Don't touch. -It's mine. -It's mine. -Mom, he is bullying me. -Mom, he is bullying me. There are two of you and only one of him. How does one bully two? Try to be sensible. He will be enlisted soon. Do you know that there are no drumsticks in the army? Yes, you enjoyed it the last time. Now, it's my turn. Maria, bring a cloth! Why don't you get it yourself? He doesn't know where it's kept. How would he get it? See how you pamper him. How do you expect me to discipline my son? He really doesn't know where it is. Let me go get it. Mom, sit down and eat. Maria is here. With you two around, he can't stand up for himself. You think he's a fool, but he's actually very smart. He's a clever boy in school. With his caliber, he should make it to OCS and be an officer. "OCS"? Nine more months of training. No, thank you. I don't get you. You were just a corporal back then. Why are you forcing him to be an officer now? I wanted to be an officer, but I couldn't because of an injury. See, it's your dream. Not mine. I want to go overseas and study with my girlfriend. I hate the army. I'm not ready. You'll be ready once you get enlisted. "Not ready" will turn into "ready." -Nobody can force me. -Am I forcing you? This is a constitutional requirement. -Do you know the constitution? -Whatever. -Damn the mom. -His mom is here. A waste of my breath. -Damn your grandma. -His grandma is here. Ken, come and eat more. Mrs. Mary Chow. Hello, good evening, Mr. Ong. -Hello. -Hello. Have a seat. Do you remember me? I'm the lady who carried the baby in the market during the elections. Our picture together came out in the papers. Yes. So, what can I do for you, Mrs. Chow? Mine is a very small case. You see, I have this big plan. That is to send my son overseas to study with his girlfriend. Then, they will come back with their certificates. Two certificates. You like certificates, right? You see, whatever the government likes, I like it too. After that, they will get married and they will have children, right? But now, I have this small problem. What's the problem? My son, Ken, is enlisting in two weeks. That means he will have to serve for two years. He'll go to university for three years. That means the earliest I can get a grandson is in six years. You always say that Singaporeans choose to marry late and there are not enough babies. But can't you see? It's very obvious that all of this is due to one problem. -What's the problem? -National Service. But don't worry. I'm a reasonable type of Singaporean. I'm here to ask you to write a letter to MINDEF to defer him for three years. Defer, okay? Not excuse. Every Singapore boy must serve in the National Service. But don't you think it's better if he comes back with a certificate and serve Singapore better. Serve the nation better with his certificate, right? No worries, Mrs. Chow. I'll help you write a letter to MINDEF. See, Ken, I told you. You talk to this kind of good MP, as long as our request is reasonable, he will be very understanding and help us. -Say thank you to Mr. Ong. -Thank you. You're welcome. Stupid MP. Idiot MP. Ineffective MP. He promised to help us, but see where we are now. He's so useless. There's no way I'm going to vote for him in the next election. I hate these people who don't keep their word. I told you so. When it involves the law, don't bother. It's a waste of time. You always think you're very smart and can beat the system. Yes, my brain is not working. You can repair it if it's broken, but yours has turned to ash. -Do you get it? -Hey. Mom, did you see my girlfriend? No, I didn't. I can't find her. Look at that ferry. No wonder the defense budget is so high. Do you know this is our money? If it's shabby, you will complain. If it looks good, you say the government is wasting money. It's tough being the government these days. Everyone is picking on the government. You're the only one who is sucking up to them. What's wrong with you? Planning to be an MP? That's enough. Ken is enlisting now. What's the point in arguing? Ken, come. I'm so sorry, okay? But you know I tried my best, right? Since we are in this situation, we have no choice, but to listen to your uncle. You can fake that you're sick and avoid work. If not, take MC. If not, act confused. Lastly, act crazy. Always remember that your safety comes first. What's the second one? Protect my country. No, your family. -Protect the country comes third. -Okay. Ken. Listen, you must do your best in the army. Don't listen to your mom or your uncle. Listen to me, okay? I have confidence in you. You can make it to-- Shit, give me a break. It's so big. Just like a resort. It's huge here. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a section bunk for 16 people. This table over here is where recruits -can sit, relax, and study. -This is the bunk. -And over this way... -Come. Follow me, please. Look at this place. It looks like a hostel for foreign workers. Dear, can you talk to the head of Tekong Camp and get Ken upgraded to a single room. A single room is not good enough. How about the Presidential Suite? -Really? What would it cost? -You really have a faulty brain. Do you think this is a hotel where you can upgrade anytime? The bunk is already much better than the ones in my time. Luckily, this fan is big. Otherwise, it's going to be hot. Hey, why isn't there a television? It will be great if there is a big television hanging there where everyone can watch. Then, it will be like the hospital. -Nonsense! -Nonsense! -Mom, we like it here. -Mom, we like it here. -Can we stay here instead? -Can we stay here instead? Are the two of you crazy? This is for boys. Do you want to sleep with all of them? Excuse me, this bed is for the recruits. -Sorry. -Don't dirty the beds. -Get off. -Hurry. Sergeant, I heard that soldiers nowadays have it good. Everyone is given a laptop. Yes, it's for e-learning. What good can a laptop do? -Excuse me, may I make a suggestion? -Sure. If the army has enough budget, why don't you consider issuing a maid to each boy to assist them? So that parents like us don't have to worry so much, right? A maid? Are you bringing one to the battlefield? They can be of great help! Am I supposed to go out now? To check for enemy presence. Okay, let me go check. We don't have to do this ourselves. So who will do it? -Maria! -Yes, ma'am. -Check for the enemy. -Okay, ma'am. Run! don't look back! Don't look back! The enemy is out there. Luckily, I didn't go out there. You're so evil. You sent Maria to her death. -No, I didn't. -Excuse me. Please follow me to the auditorium. This way, please. I told her to go check for the enemy. Let's go. What are you looking at? Just checking if there are any single rooms. Good morning, parents, relatives, friends, and enlistees. Welcome to Basic Military Training Centre School 2 or BMTC School 2 in short. ...with my life. -With my life! -With my life! So, any more complaints? The food I had back then as a recruit compared to the food now was like shit. But you were eating shit. Listen. There are so many parents here today. Of course they have to put up a good show. After we leave, Ken will start suffering. You are so naïve. You're so hard to please. You always have something to say. Hey, I'm not exaggerating. Look, when we disembarked from the ferry, we saw a gorgeous place like a holiday resort. But once we stepped in here, something in the air tells me things are not what it seems. Look over there. The officers are all so friendly now. Once we leave, do you think they'll be friendly to Ken? Hey, can you two please stop arguing? I'm already frustrated. Can you please keep quiet? Now you can't wait to get rid of us. But once we leave, you're going to miss us. Ken, listen to me. You must call back and report every day no matter what. If something happens to you, I don't care if it's the OC or CO, I don't care what his rank is, I'll complain until he has no rank. Do you understand? -Ken, hand over your bag. -Why? Don't ask, just give me your bag. Open up the bag. You can't do that. Open up. Mom, why so sneaky? It's all right. If you get caught, just tell them to come arrest Grandma. -You must take care, don't volunteer. -Bye. -Remember what I said. -Bye. -Left, right. -Left, right. Your fellow recruit here has shamelessly volunteered to be the demonstrator for today. You are in Ninja Company, Platoon 2, Section 2, and this is your bunk. Recruit Sam, Recruit Kumar, over here. Recruit Bang, Recruit Chow, over here. Recruit Ming, Recruit Singh, over here. Recruit San, Recruit Leo, over here. Recruit Man, Recruit Jin, over here. Recruit Muthu, Recruit Ismail, over here. I'm your Sect Con, Sergeant Heng. All of you get settled. After that, prepare your admin kit and get ready for a haircut. -Is that clear? -Yes, Sergeant. You all must say, "Yes, Sergeant", okay? I've been posted to Ninja Company, Platoon 2, Section 2. In the next two months, I'll be wasting my time training with people who come from everywhere. People who have weird backgrounds. Brother, I'm your buddy. In the next nine weeks, we'll be sleeping in the same bed. No, I'm on the top bed. Here, this is my name card. You're Ken, right? -I'm Lobang. -"Lo" what? -My English name is Lobang. -I see, Lobang. Anyway, you are so lucky to be my buddy. Why? If your mobile phone dies, I'm the man. You have batteries? I can even bring in a generator. Any voltage you want, I've got it. Just don't get freaked out. Brother. Goodness, you're so on the ball. You shaved before enlisting. Were you a monk before this? -I beg your pardon. -I'm joking. Here. -Lobang. -I'm Aloysius. "Black bra"? Surname? -Jin. -"Wear black bra"? You can call me SL. It stands for my Chinese name. Jin it is. Brother. I'm Lobang. IP Man. "IP Man"? The Chinese martial artist! His English name was a hoot, but yours beat him hands down. That's powerful. Brother. Your hairstyle looks good. Thank you. But it will be gone soon. You're about to be shaved. Why are you still wearing a helmet? It will soon be our turn. It's your turn. For the last time. Shit, I can't do this anymore. Brother, that's like a lion dance. Fall in. I can't believe it. I'm in the army now. Hey, guys, come take a look. All my batteries are originals. No fakes. So they won't screw up your phones. Just let me know what you need. Ken, next time you drink coffee, you will miss me. And grandma also misses you. Do you have a charger? A camera phone? We can't bring this in. Better hide it. Even if it's allowed, you can't charge the phone. If you charge it, you'll be charged. -Barbecued jerky, want some? -Thanks. -Hey, have some barbecued jerky. -Thanks. Barbecued jerky. Have some, brother. Have some, brother. Excuse me, is this pork? It's beef. Here you go. Silent room! Hey, you! Whenever you hear "silent room", -don't move! -Don't move! You're supposed to stop whatever the hell you're doing and keep still. Is that clear? -Yes, Sergeant. -Yes, Sergeant. Anyway, my name is Sergeant Ong. And I am your Platoon Sergeant. From today onwards, I expect all of you to start working together as a section. Because over the next nine weeks, -you'll not only eat together, -Hey. sleep together, shit together, but most importantly, learn together. And every step along the way, I will be there to take care of all of you. Just like your mom. Quiet! Who gave you permission to laugh? Everything you do in the army, you must ask for permission. -Is that clear? -Yes, Sergeant! What are all these? Are you opening a provision shop? No, sir. I bought them to share with everyone. -Building connections on the first day? -No, Sergeant. Anyway, let me also remind you. You're not allowed to charge your phones in this camp. -Excuse me. -What "excuse me"? Is my name "excuse me"? Sorry, Sergeant. I'm only a specialist, you only salute an officer. -What's the question? -Nothing. Giving up so easily. Today is only your first day. You still have nine weeks with me, Recruit Ken Chow. Anyway, I know what you want to ask. Why can't you charge your phone in this camp? Let me tell you. We allow you to use your phone. But not to be on the phone for a long time. Heard that before? If you don't talk on the phone so much, you won't need to charge your phone. Later, you will realize sleeping is more important than talking on the phone. Okay, all those with camera phones, surrender them now. Okay, Section 2, carry on. No, do you miss me? Hey, it's Lobang. Charge all the non-camera phone batteries for me. Reserve five for me per model. The market here is so big with a stable customer base. Before this, I had to wait for walk-ins, but the business is booming here. Everything is fine here. Don't worry, Mom. Everyone here is very friendly. But they are not as smart as your son. Yes, Mom. I will fight all the way to become the company's best recruit. Hi, Mom. Yes, I'm okay. Don't worry. Have you spoken to Amy recently? I've been trying to call her, but her phone is always engaged. I don't know what's wrong. Mom... "OCS." Aloysius Jin. Come on, you can do it. You must be the first to fall in. Yes, OCS. Yes! Platoon 2, fall in! -Platoon 2, fall in. -Fall in. Platoon 2, fall in! -Fall in. -Platoon 2, hurry up! Don't take your own sweet time. It's time to serve the country. Come on, let's go! -Hurry up! -Let's go! Hurry up. -Platoon 2, fall in! -Hurry up. You. I want you to be the platoon IC. Report strength. Hey, not you. You. -Me? -Yes, you. Faster. -Count strength. -Count strength. Forty-eight. Forty-eight, who? Forty-eight, Platoon Sergeant. Shouldn't it be 49? There's one guy missing. Everyone, check if your buddy is here. Recruit Ken Chow is missing, Platoon Sergeant! Where is he? I saw him in the toilet just now. -I think he is still shitting. -"Shitting"? He's taking his sweet time on the first day of falling in? I want all of you to echo, "Recruit Ken, hurry up." -Carry on. -One, two. -Recruit Ken, hurry up! -Recruit Ken, hurry up! -Recruit Ken, hurry up! -Recruit Ken, hurry up! -Recruit Ken, hurry up! -Recruit Ken, hurry up! -Recruit Ken, hurry up! -Recruit Ken, hurry up! -Recruit Ken, hurry up! -Recruit Ken, hurry up! -Recruit Ken, hurry up! -Recruit Ken, hurry up! No toilet paper, Sergeant! Permission to get Recruit Ken toilet paper, Platoon Sergeant! Go, faster. Sorry, Sergeant. I have to shit every morning. If not, I can't do anything. If you need to shit, you wake up earlier to shit. Because of your shit, you held up the whole Company. -Sorry, Sergeant. -And your attire. You are supposed to be in PT kit and sports shoes. -Shit. -"Shit" again? No, sorry, Sergeant. -Permission to go and change, Sergeant. -Go, faster. You. Is he your buddy? -No, Platoon Sergeant. -Then, why are you so nosy? Because as platoon mates, we should help each other, Platoon Sergeant. Good. I like what he said. As soldiers, you should not only take care of your buddy. You must also keep a lookout for your platoon mates and section mates. Who is his buddy? Recruit Lobang, Sergeant. You as his buddy need to know his whereabouts at all times. But since today is the first time, I will not take any action. -Thank you, Platoon Sergeant. -But from now on, all of you better take care of one another. We leave no man behind. Understand? Yes, Platoon Sergeant. Are you guys a bunch of ladies? Louder! Yes, Platoon Sergeant! Anyway, from now on, when I say 5 a.m. fall in, I expect all of you to be here by 4:50 a.m. Yes, I don't like to lose. That's my style. But that is also the SAF style. You, what's your name? Recruit Jin, Platoon Sergeant. "Jin"? Jin what? Some of my friends call me Aloysius Jin. Some call me SL Jin. What does SL stand for? Jin Sie Lang. In English, please. Jin Sia Lang. Quiet! Don't laugh at other people's names. From tomorrow, I expect to see an improvement. -Is that clear? -Yes, Platoon Sergeant. You guys are ninjas, not ladies. -Is that clear? -Yes, Platoon Sergeant! One thing I can't understand. Why does the army accept commanders who are medically unfit? All of them are deaf. No matter how loud you answer, they always say they can't hear us. "Lady" is supposed to be a very sweet word to describe a woman. I don't know why this word is so terribly misused -by all the section commanders in the SAF. -Come on. Pull. You are flying. Come on. National Service really screws up my life. Why should I give them my 100 percent? Of course I can do better than this. Yes, the law forces me to be here. Yes, they can have my body, but they will never win my heart. Sounds like a prostitute, right? Yes, so what? Hi, guys, over here. Hi, guys, don't be shy. Okay, in case you're unsure of what Platoon Sergeant taught. Please take a look how I pack my cabinet and bed and you'll be safe, okay? Uniform with name tags facing outside. Socks on one side, personal items on this side. The pillowcase must be folded properly. Boots must be polished, including the soles. Room. Section 2, attention. Good evening, Platoon Sergeant. Section 2 ready for inspection. -Carry on. -Thank you, Platoon Sergeant. Section 2 stand at ease. Section 2, since today is your first time doing stand-by bed. I will not be too harsh on you. But I want all of you to make sure that you take note of everything that I say. -Is that clear? -Yes, Platoon Sergeant! Hey, come here. Yes, Platoon Sergeant. I know you really miss your girlfriend, but you must always remember. Your girlfriend belongs to you, but this mirror belongs to the army. Before you pasted the photos here, did you ask for permission? -No, Platoon-- -Then? Gentlemen. Always remember. As long as you are in the army, before you do anything, you must seek permission. Is that clear? Yes, Platoon Sergeant! Ken, are you ready? -Yes, Platoon Sergeant. -Sure? -Yes. -Sure. Yes, who? Yes, Platoon Sergeant. Okay, good. Let's see. Hey, Ken. What is this? This is a shaver. Of course, I know it's a shaver. Do you think I'm stupid? I'm asking you why is it so dirty? Because I shaved. -Are you trying to be funny with me? -No, Platoon Sergeant. I ask you one last time. Why is your shaver so dirty? I already asked my maid -to clean it for me. -Wait. Your mate? Is it your platoon mate or section mate? Filipino maid. Quiet! So, do you want me to give your maid a call and ask your maid to carry on 20 for you? I think now is not a good time because she's still cooking dinner. Then? Why don't I just carry on 20 for her? Of course it is you, who else? -Maria! -What "Maria"? -Ninja. -Ninja. Ninja! -Permission to carry on, Platoon Sergeant. -Carry on. One, two, three... -Aloysius, looking good. -six... -Thank you, Platoon Sergeant! -seven, eight... -So, are you ready? -Yes, Platoon Sergeant. -All right, let's see. -twelve, thirteen... Platoon Sergeant! I prepared this stand-by bed long ago for inspection, Platoon Sergeant. -Impressive. -eighteen... So you're entirely sure that your entire area is clean? Yes, Platoon Sergeant! Absolutely sure? Yes, Platoon Sergeant! Confirm and double confirm? Yes, Platoon Sergeant! What is this? You blow. That's dust, right? Is that clean? Gentlemen. This is a very good example for me to share with all of you. I know Aloysius is very confident for the stand-by bed. But you must be careful not to be overconfident. You apply this during wartime. If I were the enemy, you are already dead. You know what to do, right? Ninja! One, Platoon Sergeant. Two, Platoon Sergeant. Three, Platoon Sergeant. Four, Platoon Sergeant. Five, Platoon Sergeant. Six, Platoon Sergeant. Seven, Platoon Sergeant. Eight, Platoon Sergeant. Nine, Platoon Sergeant. Ten, Platoon Sergeant. Eleven, Platoon Sergeant. Twelve, Platoon Sergeant. My friend told me they used to have a tough time during stand-by bed. But now is much better. Let me tell you, stand-by bed in the past was really tough. Do you want to hear their stories? Okay. Gentlemen. Ready for your stand-by bed? -Yes, Sergeant! -Yes, Sergeant! Are you sure? -Yes, Sergeant! -Yes, Sergeant! If I catch any bloody mistake, I've got the right to punish you. -Yes or no? -Yes, Sergeant! -Clean? -Yes, Sergeant. -Everything is clean? -Yes, Sergeant. What's this? So dirty. You dare to say clean. You call this clean? You think I'm a fool? You think I'm full of shit? Throw it away! Throw it downstairs! You call this making up your bed? Do you think I'm stupid? I'm bald, but I'm not stupid! I don't care! You get your buddy to bring this downstairs to the parade square now! -Do you understand? -Yes, Sergeant! Hey, do you call this clean? Who do you take me for? You think I'm blind? I see the whole lot of you. Bloody maggots. Do you think I'm stupid? Enough is enough! I give you two minutes. I don't care how the bloody hell you do it. I give you two minutes to bring this bloody cupboard down to the parade square to see me. Do you understand? -Yes, Sergeant! -Get lost! Let's all work together as a team, gentlemen. I want to see teamwork. Gentlemen, this is not torture. This is called training. I'm training you to work together, to enjoy together, to suffer together. You don't want to work hard, I can do this the whole night. I can appear in your bloody nightmare every bloody night. Take your bloody time then. Gentlemen, why are you here? -My cupboard is dirty. -My cupboard is dirty. -My bed is untidy. -My bed is untidy. Tell the whole bloody battalion that my section is rubbish. Say it a hundred times. -My section is rubbish. -My section is rubbish. Hey, are you sure? You're exaggerating, right? How can that be possible? Why would I bluff you? Yes, he's right. My uncle told me. In the past, the army is very tough. But now, everyone says we are very lucky. To be honest, I don't know how this is considered lucky. Still no freedom. Commanders can still torture us any way they like. No, they can't torture you. The handbook already says all the can and can't. Like pushups. The maximum that the sergeant can mete out is 20. -Is that so? -Yes. And 30 for the PC. If they don't follow the rules, we can complain about them. They have an army, but we have moms. Yes. So now, is the army or our moms more powerful? Of course it's the army. In the army, by right, many things are forbidden. But sometimes they go by left. They can do many things, but they cannot do anything. Like what? For example, you have an excuse for leg injuries, and your hand is not injured, then work your hand. If your hand is injured, but your leg is not, then work your leg. This coffee smells great. It's amazing that here in Pulau Tekong, we can still enjoy coffee just like at Toastbox. Toastbox has no lights-off. -Welcome to Tekong. -Tekong. Unknowingly, I've been in the army for three days. I'm starting to miss Mom, Grandma, my sisters, but most of all, my girlfriend. I wonder if she misses me too. You know, tonight is our wedding night. "Wedding night"? Weapon presentation. I'm curious and excited to know how my wife will look like. Guys, after tonight, we are all married men. Why are you so happy? This wife is a pain. She sticks to you wherever you go. You'll be punished for mistreating her. And she has a loud voice, "Bang!" You can't say no to marriage and you can't get a divorce. Worst thing is, you can't go to bed with her. -Aloysius Jin. -Sir! Thank you, sir. Most of us have never touched a real weapon before. But when the PC presented my wife, -I mean my rifle to me, -Thank you, sir. I had this very strange feeling inside. Sir. Thank you, sir. -Recruit Lobang. -Sir. Thank you, sir. -Recruit Muthu Shanmugam. -Sir. Thank you, sir. -Recruit Tan Wei Ming. -Thank you, sir. -Recruit Chen Ke Ai. -Thank you, sir. -Recruit Kumar. -Thank you, sir. -I, -I, -hereby swear -hereby swear -before the flag -before the flag -that I will be brave, -that I will be brave, -honorable, -honorable, -disciplined, -disciplined, -vigilant, -vigilant, -and I will take good care -and I will take good care -of my rifle -of my rifle -at all times. -at all times. From ah boys to men, serving two years Straight away, this wife keeps sticking to us wherever we go. Without this wife, I believe that we could all run faster. But as a married man, do we have a choice? Because we love our land And want it to be free Steady lah! From ah boys to men, serving two years For our nation, our country With blood, sweat, and tears We'll be marching on with pride and glory From BMT to POP to ORD As a boy in Singapore, You got to do your thing Step up and serve the country, Got to do your thing 5BX every morning has become a routine Wonder why I have to serve Once I turned 18 From a head full of hair, We have to shave it all Every time strength training Gets hit by a medicine ball Suddenly What the hell are you doing, lady? -Acting cute? -No, Sergeant. Suddenly introduced to my brand new wife -Faster! -I promise to protect her with my life! I trained so hard for my SOC But I forgot to train for my IPPT -So my PC told me, "You're damn unlucky! -I can't. -This week you have to stay back for RT!" -I can't do it! -Now I can't escape and I'm so annoyed -I want to stop. -I'm just a recruit so I have no choice -No, I'm not. I cannot do this. Please help me. Mom, help me! -You can. Just relax. -Don't look down. -One leg, one log. -One leg, one log. One leg, one log. Don't worry. You're ready, right? -You can do it, come on. -It's so high! It's so high! No, I can't. Mom, help me! My buddy and I really became good brothers after a few incidents like these. We both have the same goals. We hate the army, we hate National Service! We just want to pretend until the Operationally Ready Date. The medical center has become our most frequented place. Actually, reporting in sick is not as easy as it seems. It's a very special skill. It encompasses acting skills and medical knowledge. Whatever sickness you tell the MO must be untraceable. It's okay even if the whole world knows you're pretending. As long as your pretense is certified by the MO, nobody can do anything about it. But Lobang and I enjoy reporting sick together and getting excused. Attend B is a consolation prize. Attend C is the first prize. But don't belittle excuse boots. Excuse boots mean being excused from many things. But some commanders just couldn't stand our pretense and they would also think of a way to torture us and make us look so stupid. Take a look. -One, two, three. -Down. Company, fall in! -Fall in, guys. -Today, everyone is so happy because today is our first book out day. Fall in! Gentlemen. Today is your first book out day. I want all of you to open your eyes wide and take a look at Singapore again. -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! It is a bustling city, right? -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! It is a beautiful city, right? -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! This prosperous nation did not come about by chance. It is because of what you are wearing right now! -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! Remember, more sweat today, less blood tomorrow. Enjoy your book out. -Thank you, sir! -Thank you, sir! Platoon, attention! Turn to your left. To your left! By the left, forward march. -Left, right. -Ninja! -Left, right. -Yes. Today is our book out day Book out Today is our book out day Book out, book out day, hey! Book out, book out day Mom! My son, big boy. Here's my boy. Ken! -Hey, Mom! -Ken! You are so skinny. -Take a picture for us. -Okay. -You're bald. -Smile. I was so worried about you. I keep praying for your training to go smoothly. Mom, did you see Amy? Amy? No, I didn't. Maybe she wants to give you a surprise. -Come, let's go home first, okay? -Come. Surprise! -Welcome home! -Welcome home! Let me take your bag, sir. -Thanks. -Don't get photographed, okay? Don't take any photos, okay? Mom, why is there a party? Hey, my son went to the army and came home as a man. Furthermore, you were away for two weeks. It was such a long time, so of course we have to celebrate, right? -Yes. -Yes. I cooked a lot of food for you. Reminds me of the time when I was confined for a month and came home for the first time. Do you remember? Of course. I'm home! -You're home! -Welcome home! Come, sit down. You're so tanned. I'm under the sun every day. Of course I'd be tanned. How's life inside the camp? It's tough. I don't understand what the officers are saying in English. Come, turn around and enjoy the breeze -Is it new? -Yes. I'm so hungry. Any food? Yes, it's ready. I'll take a shower first. -Eat up. -Eat up. Hey, that drumstick is for your brother. He's deprived in the army. But I also want it. It's okay, take it. Go on. That's great, my brother has finally grown up. Yes. Doting on his younger sister. Stop it. You're making me feel embarrassed. Let's eat. Why can't I see my teeth? You don't have any, that's why. See? Let's shine the back as well. Last time, the whole family was mobilized when one man is enlisted. A bonus for the army. Isn't it the same now? What do you call this? Come, let's get ready. Ken, do you guys still sing when you run? Yes, we do. We used to sing a Hokkien soldier anthem. -Ever heard of it? -Which one? -Want to hear it? -Okay. Thank you. Mic test. June 23rd was a bad day It's the day when I was enlisted I took a cab early morning And arrived at Central Manpower Base When I got to CMPB Officer took my red IC Asked to do a body checkup Then I was sent to Basic Military Training BMT is a one-storey house It's also my holiday resort There are chairs, beds, and cabinets And also army uniforms Two black stripes means Corporal Three black stripes is Sergeant And the one with the black baton He is called the Company Sergeant Major Go! -If the Sergeant loses his temper -You have two minutes, not two days! We have to run up and down In our Number 3 and Number 4 attires We'll be asked to change For no good reason Go! Run quickly, soldier! -We start training from dawn until dusk -Everywhere we go Charge! Come on! -Worse is running five kilometers -Faster! Sometimes carrying casualty Gentlemen, I'm going to share something very serious with you today. Something that is an important knowledge in your lives as SAF soldiers. Whether you win a war or not, it does not matter with this thing. In fact, if you do not know about this, it'll be a shame to be called soldiers in the SAF. Gentlemen, do you know what a CB leaf is? All of you, pick up a CB leaf. Now, turn. Open it like this. This is crazy. Gentlemen, I proudly announce that you're no longer boys. You're now men. Take your time! Slowly, gentlemen. Bloody maggots! Take your time, it's okay. All of you, kiss the tree and come back. Go! Hey, even my grandma can crawl faster than you run! Slowly, gentlemen, never mind. Take your bloody time! I've got a whole day to play with you. Take your time! Okay, take your time, it's all right. I've got a whole day to play with you. Gentlemen, you've been taught how to camouflage. You have exactly one minute. Go camouflage yourselves and come back here. -Do you understand me? -Yes, Sergeant! -Go. -Yes, Sergeant. Go! Gentlemen! Fall in. Fall in! Hey, can you see me? No, Sergeant. How can you fight when you can't see the enemy? Sergeant, if I can't see them, they can't see me. Bloody hell, you dare to talk back! You crazy bugger, using so many CB leaves! You like CB, is that it? Bloody idler, go and redo! Go! Are you nuts? I know I lose my temper easily. Did u think all these leaves would cool me down? What an idiot. Go and redo, bloody hell! Those with CB leaves, go and redo! Go! Those with CB leaves, go and redo! Gentlemen, you are on a tactical mission. Don't move like elephants. Keep your frame small. Go lower, come on. -Duck! -Duck! Find a cover, bloody hippopotamus! Are you calling the bank? It's bang! Where are your bangs? The enemy is standing. Charge! I said, charge! So soft, like a lady! Then you "bang!" Shoot at your friend. Where are your bangs? All of you shoot blindly. The enemy might as well kill themselves! Come on, find cover! Enemy standing! Charge! Are the sergeants still like that now? No way. Army training now is less taxing. I'll go change. No, let's eat first. Everyone is hungry. -Ken, listen. -Come. You don't have to be so serious in the army. Focus on pretending and escaping. Get a downgrade. Otherwise, they may post you to Armor or Tank unit. You'll be exhausted just cleaning the vehicles. Engineer Unit dismantle bombs and build bridges. If you're infantry, in times of war, you're first in line to get hit. That's why I pretended all the way to being a storeman. You think the storeman will not die? Missiles are fired everywhere during a war. You'll still get hit wherever you are. The storeman is included. Storeman will die too? Storeman may be the first to die. Why? Because they are physically unfit for combat, they are weak from head to toe. They won't be able to run, so they will be the first to die in a war. Hey, but some of the fake unfit soldiers may run faster than the commandos in a war. When I was a commando, I met people like that all the time. -You were a commando? -Of course. Go kill yourself and stop embarrassing the commandos. Ken, in the army, the guys who can't fake their way to Pes C are the ones to defame us Pes C guys. This is simply jealousy. Come, I will teach you how to act. You talk so much, but you never teach him how to master the art of pretending. -Do it now. -All right. You really must have lost your mind. How can you teach your son to do this? And what kind of uncle are you? As a recruit, you pretended until ROD. You even continued to pretend after you ROD. You never repent. Now you want my son to do the same? Richard, how can you say that? Pretending is an art. I'm just sharing with my nephew what I learned in the army. I'm not forcing him to join me. Ken, you better go get changed. Hey, give me a chance. Let me finish what I have to say. -You better get changed-- -Hey. Just let him tell his story. It's not enough to just pretend in the army. You have to also suck up to prevent being exposed. I was so good at it that my OC wanted to promote me to Corporal. I begged him not to. You turned down the promotion? There's no pay rise and you have to serve for two and a half years. If I perform well, my reward is to serve six more months. That's bullshit. It's not a reward, it's a punishment. Whoever came up with this law must be nuts or full of shit. Luckily, they scraped that. I feel differently. If I'm asked to serve six more months, it's because the OC values my contribution. What's wrong with that? I was a Corporal and was promoted to Local Sergeant. Local Sergeant, what a loser! What is a Local Sergeant? Do the work of a Sergeant, but get the Corporal's pay. Not bad. What an innovative idea. Dear, tomorrow when you go to the office, appoint someone as the GM, but pay him the clerk's salary. And his title can be Local GM. -Good idea! -Good idea! Ken, don't you learn from your uncle. Just do well in your BMT. I'm sure you'll make it to OCS. OCS? Not again. It's an honor to be an officer. It's the army's recognition of your ability. Ken, never be an officer! Can you all just give me a break? Right, can you all just give him a break? Yes, you all just give him a break. Fine, let's not talk about the army. Ken, your cousin told me to show you this. Ken. Goodness, shit. -Hi. -Who's that guy on Facebook? Why are you two so close? He's just a friend. Can you calm down and listen to me? Okay, I'm calm. Let's just talk about it. I actually wanted to tell you about this a few days ago, but I didn't want it to affect your mood in the army. Are you trying to break up with me? Yes. I want to meet you now! I don't care. I want to meet you now! I know when we meet, you'll get very impulsive. So let's just talk here, okay? Okay, I promise. I won't be impulsive. Let's just meet and talk about it. Are you sure you won't get impulsive? I promise, I won't get impulsive. Where do you want to meet? Okay, let's meet at the usual place. I'm in BMT. The hardest part of my life. And you choose to leave me now? -What kind of a girlfriend are you? -I'm going if you're talking like that. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Can you just tell me? Did the two of you sleep together? If I say no, will you believe me? Just tell me, yes or no? Tell me! How is he better than me? Tell me! He's not impulsive like you. He doesn't scream. He doesn't shout. He doesn't cry like you do! It's very simple. I'll change for you, I promise. Trust me, okay? I'll send you off. When are you leaving? Next Saturday afternoon, but you don't have to come and send me. Why? Is he going to send you off? No, he's going to go with me. What? The bloody idiot! -The retarded child! -Excuse me! He's an army officer and he was the best trainee. He has a positive attitude, not like you! Positive attitude? This guy stole my girlfriend and that's called a positive attitude? That's why I hate the army! I hate officers! Excuse me. Do you need anything to cover yourself? Are you okay? You should come down. You'll fall sick in this weather. Come on down. Everything will be okay. Here, take this. Take care of yourself. Thank you. Amy broke up with you? You should thank our ancestors for helping you see through her now. She dumped you in the middle of the night at Benjamin Sheares Bridge and hopped into someone else's car. If she had stayed by your side for another minute, you'd be worrying when she's going to poison you. That's enough, okay? You think? I think he needs to wake up. With Amy gone, you should focus on the army because the army won't abandon you. Many people would complain about the army. Nothing seemed good enough. Later, they discover that they could apply the lessons they had learned from the army in both life and work. This is my personal experience. -Hey! -Sir! See, you pissed him off and he left his bag behind. -You go and chase him. -Sir! Sir, wait! Sir! Sir, your bag! Sir! I heard Urban Ops is great fun. Aren't you going? I'm going to report in sick. Why? I've got menses. Gosh, why don't you just say you had your womb removed? Recruit Chow Ken! Hi, my name is Ken Chow, not Chow Ken. Thank you. Recruit Ken Chow. You again. Morning, sir. So what's your story now? I have heart sickness. I'm wondering whether you can give me a few days of medical leave. I don't need to go to the hospital. Just a few days to rest at home and I'll be okay. "Heart sickness"? Permission to join in, Platoon Sergeant. I thought you were sick. Why did you come back? Your ploy didn't work, right? -Can you put in more effort? -Yes, Platoon Sergeant. Carry on, go. He's from your section. Every platoon has a black sheep like that. Hey, he's from your platoon. -Clear! -Clear! -Clear! -Clear! -Clear! -Clear! Hey, stop dreaming! -One, two, three... -This is a group exercise. How can you leave one man behind? Always remember... -Leave no man behind! -six, seven... This is why you are getting punished. Do you see that? I've said it so many times. Drink more water. All of you better go and drink up. I don't want any of you to be the next nor get heat injury. -Understand? -Yes, Platoon Sergeant! Are you okay? Problem with your girlfriend? I knew it, you can't hide it from me. This is called mutiny. Ken, based on past records, ninety percent of the enlistees' girlfriends will leave them. It's all part of the BMT package. Take it easy, man. Ken, actually, the army purposely provided this program because during a real war, if our girlfriends get killed, we'll know how to manage the pain. Control our tears and continue fighting. Because you may lose your girlfriend, but you must never lose your country. -Well said, dude. -Well said, dude. Hey, Ken. Just take it that your girlfriend has been killed. She won't be coming back. Forget her. Easy for you to say. You're not the one getting dumped. If your girlfriend leaves you during your BMT, then she's not worth your time. It's not a bad thing. Hey, you are not me. You don't know how I feel. This is why I don't want to be involved in boy-girl relationships. It's such a waste of time. What are you trying to say about me? Brother, don't. We're in training. Hey, where's your muzzle? Shit! My muzzle. Did you see my muzzle? I think Sergeant Heng took it. I thought I saw him pick one up. -Shit. -No way. Lobang, do you sell muzzles? You think I'm an arms dealer? Shit. Give me a good reason not to punish you. Sergeant, if you let me book out, I can go to Beach Road and buy ten for the Company. What did you say? Sorry, I don't book out. Why don't I call my mom? She'll buy ten and send them here. I don't think you understand the situation. Sergeant, actually, my girlfriend broke up with me recently. That's why I can't focus during training. Is that so? You know, during my BMT, my girlfriend broke up with me too. But my Platoon Sergeant was crazy. He gave me three days off. -Not bad, right? -Yes, not bad. Are you also thinking I should do the same to settle things? -Yes, Sergeant. -Bloody hell, Recruit Ken! You made a mistake and yet you're hoping for a miracle. Wrongdoers don't get to daydream. We are not here just to talk about a lost muzzle. We are here to talk about a soldier losing his sense of responsibility. -Sorry, Sergeant. -If a soldier is irresponsible, how is he going to protect the country? From the moment you stepped into my office, you hadn't shown a single sign of remorse. -You will stay back this weekend. -Sergeant, I can't! Please! My girlfriend is going overseas. -I need to send her off. -Hello. Didn't you break up with her? Doesn't that make her a "past tense"? So why are you sending off your "past tense"? Sergeant, you don't understand. This is my last chance to win her back. I have to send her off. Next week, you can give me two or three confinements. -I don't mind. -Hey, this is the army, not the market. You don't come and bargain with me. Get out of my office! -Sir, please listen-- -Out! What did Platoon Sergeant say? -I got confined. -What? Confinement? Game over. Isn't your girlfriend flying off this weekend? I hate the army, I hate the Platoon Sergeant! -I hate the army! -Keep it down. If they hear you, they'll add one more charge. What if I just don't give a shit and leave Tekong? What can they do to me? No, that's AWOL. If you get caught, it's very serious. Hey, Ken. You want to go AWOL? We're in Tekong. Are you planning to swim? You must be stupid. You'd be caught before you reach the shore. History has already proven it. What history? Don't you know? There was a recruit in Tekong. He thinks he's an Olympics swimmer. He planned to swim back to Singapore. He was caught halfway. Ken, listen to me. Women are like clothes, ready to be discarded when you've worn it. Why must you insist on wearing this one? No. You don't understand. I have a strong feeling that she's testing me. She thinks it's impossible for me to send her off. But I'm going to surprise her. I'm going to Changi Airport to send her off. She'll be so touched when she sees me. Tears will flow down her face. I know. I know she's going to love me. Lobang! You were trained in Sim Lim Square, right? All of your ideas are out of the box. Can you please help me? Hey, buddy, are you challenging me? If we were not in Tekong, I'd have plenty of ideas. But we are in Tekong. There's nothing we can do. But I can share with you some stories. Do you know how past soldiers faked illness to get medical leave? -Ready? -Ready. -Okay? -Okay. -Can you? -I can. One, two, three! -Pour more. -More! Enough. That hurts! That's so painful. Damn. Our parents would be so sad to find out we're hurting ourselves like that. -What? -I have a suggestion. Why don't you just... Chop her up into pieces? Yes, no point sacrificing so much. Let me tell you. Next time, when other guys pick her up, they'll be like rag-and-bone men. Because she is a used good. Hello, excuse me. Please respect the rag-and-bone man, okay? Lobang. Wasn't a recruit from Platoon 4 down with heat injury? How is he now? I heard he's enjoying himself. He's in the hospital with ten-days medical leave. What a life. Ten days! That's the highest level of acting for you. That's nice. There's air-conditioning and he gets to talk to beautiful nurses. Ten days... I must make myself sick. I must fake the medical leave, so that I can go to the airport to win her back. What is a weekend confinement? No one can stop me. I love Amy. I'll do whatever it takes to win her back. This is the war between me, Amy, and the army. I cannot afford to lose this war. I cannot afford to lose her. We are infantry We are infantry We are the best in Ninja Company We are the best in Ninja Company We got no time for lemonade We got no time for lemonade But got time to throw grenade Fall in, hurry up! Water parade. All right, everything off. -Everything off! -Everything off! Hurry up. The SAF seven core values are... The SAF seven core values are... -I am thirsty. -Loyalty to the country, leadership... -But I'm not drinking any water. -discipline, fighting spirit... -This is my weapon. -ethics, and care for other soldiers. Better drink up. The weather is very hot. Stay hydrated. Caps on. -I want my body to react -Caps on. -like it's having a heat stroke. -Bottle holds down. With a bit of acting, I'm sure they'll send me to the hospital. After that, I'll sneak off to Changi Airport and surprise Amy. I'm very sure that I'll win this battle. And the army will be the loser this time. Unfortunately, my body didn't react the way I wanted it to. I collapsed and my condition got very serious. -What's the story? -Recruit Ken from Ninja Company. He collapsed during a route march. Recruit Ken, my name is Dr. Yau. Do you know where you are? Is he always like that? Was he like that when he came in? -It has been 15 minutes. -Can you check the vitals? Ready. One, two, three, move. Ken, we're giving you a shower. It will be a bit cold. Sir, it's urgent. What did the doctor say? He's in a serious condition, severely dehydrated. I kept calling him, but he's not responding. Come here quickly. -I'm on my way. -It's scary being here alone. I never expected that my own selfish war would harm so many innocent people. What rubbish is this? This is ridiculous! He's an 18-year-old boy. The whole of Tekong is so big and surrounded by water. You couldn't even give him two more drops of water? You said to drink ten times a day. That means ten times are not enough. Use your brain! Why did the army send you to university? What kind of officer are you? Who is responsible for the water? I want to find out the person in charge of the water. How could the water be enough for a young man? This is a conspiracy. Who wants him dead? I'm going to find out. If you don't tell me, I'm going to the police. Then, I'll go to the MP. I will also go to the PM! If he can't help, I'll go to the MM. MM is my friend, okay? I followed him and took the flag. He will remember me. So you better be honest with me. There are over 100 people in your company. Why was he the only one who is down? Who can tell me? I only have one son. I have only one son, you know? What am I going to do if something happened to my son? It's all your fault! Are you giving me back my son? Give him back to me! Although my dad is out of danger, I don't have the courage to face him anymore. If only I had listened to him, things wouldn't have come to this. I truly regret my naivety. People always say that there is no war in Singapore. But after this incident, I realized, no, there is. The war is inside of us. We are our own enemy. If we cannot win the war within, how are we going to fight with the real enemy? There are many battles in life. As a soldier, it's not what I am fighting. It's what I am fighting for. Ken? What on earth are you doing here? Hi, Aloysius. He's already a handful. With you in the picture, the whole platoon will go crazy. Recruit Jin. Can you share with the platoon your secret for running? Gentlemen, my secret is no secret. Whether we pass our IPPT or not is none of your business. So don't be a nosy parker. Lobang, please don't use your vulgarism on me. I didn't do anything wrong. I got you guys to quit smoking. Was it for my sake? Clearly, we are on different sides now. Bloody hell, tell me such nonsense! Who sabotaged me? No wonder my field pack was so heavy. -Lobang, I know it's you. -Hey, what are you doing? You may be full of shit, but don't throw it at me. Move! Safety pin twist, safety pin pull, safety pin out. Here, Platoon Sergeant. -That's a grenade. -Grenade! Hold it. Hold it tight. Don't let go. Mayoki told me to tell you she has broken up with you. Don't call her anymore, okay? Damn it, you stole my girl! This shit happened today. You're his buddy. Here's a chance for you to do something. -Any suggestion? -Just focus on the training. Everything will be okay. I'm so disappointed with you. You are saying the same words as him. Fine, get lost. Attack! Your acting is so good. You think by standing still, I'll believe they're behind me? No way. -Training to be cowards -Training to be cowards -Fight for myself -Fight for myself -That's cool. -Looking all around us Looking all around us -More training? That's tough. -Platoon everywhere Platoon 2, dig deeper! You're digging a shell scrape. Not a jacuzzi! Arty! -Arty! -Arty! If you don't take cover, you will die! Arty incoming!
