Today we're going to discuss chapter eight. It deals with the working day. Have you read it? I didn't have time. The others? Good. Now for the first paragraph. Marx reviews the basics of selling labor-power. Can anyone explain? Excuse me. There's something I don't understand. But it's about paragraph five. Can't it wait? It's pretty urgent. Okay, read the passage out loud. Marx writes... I'll start a bit earlier. "The capitalist has bought the labor-power at its day-rate. "He has acquired the right to make the laborer "work for him during one day. "But what is a working day? "The capitalist has his own views "on the limit of the working day. "As a capitalist, he is only personi- "capital personified. "But capital has one single life impulse: "to absorb the greatest possible amount of surplus-value. "Capital is dead labor that, vampire-like..." And this is the point. "...that, vampire-like, only lives "by sucking living labor, "and lives the more, the more labor it sucks." I'll skip down a bit. Here it says, "The prolongation of the working day into the night "only slightly quenches "the vampire thirst for the living blood of labor." And then, in the footnotes it says: "In fact, the vampire will not let go as long as there's a muscle, "a nerve, a drop of blood to be exploited." Interesting passage. What didn't you understand? Is the capitalist really a vampire? I mean our vampire. The real one. Who flies around at night. Is it Miss Flambow-Jansen? Bruno, it's just a comparison. Schnösl is right. The capitalist acts like a vampire in the sense that he "sucks" labor-power from the laborer to produce surplus-value. It's only meant metaphorically. To describe this structure he uses an image, albeit an unfortunate one. But Marx explicitly says that the capitalist sucks blood. BLOODSUCKERS On a Tuesday in August, 1928... Excuse me, Miss Octavia, but wouldn't it be advisable to turn back? - Stop calling me "Miss." - As you wish. Give that gentlemen my card. But what if it's him? Enough of that peasant gossip! And who will hold your parasol? Tell the gentleman to come at once. I shall inform him. 1. A GUEST FROM THE CLASSLESS SOCIETY Miss, will you find time to look at the Oklahoma Investment offer? I could send an overseas telegram tomorrow. Will you please stop calling me "Miss"! I'm sorry. I'm not accustomed to it yet. He surely fled from the Communist camps in Siberia. What do you think? He has yet to broach the topic. Do you think a baron would entrust such confidences to a simple employee? That would indeed be a contradiction. Baron Kobersky! I'm overjoyed that you've come to pay me a visit. But how did you find your way? You even brought champagne. Oh, you shouldn't have! I had a premonition, and went hunting for you. Your vegetarianism is to blame. They think you're walking lettuce. You'll have to overlook my assistant's lack of dexterity. But I'm still too much the daughter of a Protestant industrialist to feel comfortable hiring staff at aristocratic quantities. You're used to a different standard from St. Petersburg, I imagine? Actually, we don't have servants anymore. What do you mean? Because of the Revolution. How silly of me! I only know revolutions from newspapers. But tell me, Baron. I'm so terribly curious. Are pretty daughters of industrialists being guillotined in public? Like the court ladies in Paris once were? Not exactly. Where are my manners? I'm surely stirring up unpleasant memories. No. For one, St. Petersburg is now called Leningrad. Leningrad? See, Jakob? That's how it is now! Strangle me in my sleep, and they may name the town after you. But all jokes aside, I guess many abominations are being committed in that Lenin... I shudder to speak that hideous word. Leningrad. It almost sounds poetic when you say it in that beautiful voice. Over there, you'd have to share this house with seven lumberjack families. Appalling! But why lumberjacks? Just an example. You're a true man of letters, Baron. A regular Count Tolstoy! I can see them, those grim axe-wielders, chopping down my conservatory. Although I must admit how thrilling contemporary Russian painting is. See that one? Now tell me, what is your personal opinion of these Communists? I hate them. With what passion you suddenly speak! Do you like the model? It's a design for a new house. I'm suffocating in this imperial doll house. There's not even a telephone. But the house is very beautiful. You certainly are a man from centuries past, Baron. I bet you still send love letters by homing pigeon. Are you very shocked by my somewhat American manners? Sharing your table with a servant is indeed a bit unusual. But Jakob isn't a servant! He's my personal assistant! I even told him to stop calling me "Miss." What do you say to that? - You're nearly a Bolshevik. - On the contrary. You just don't understand our democracy. But that's enough of politics. Tell me about your passions. I like to collect mushrooms. Mushrooms? I'm nearly in love with you, Baron. I forbid you to stay at a hotel. Don't misunderstand me, but... The guest room is ready. It's a fait accompli. Stop resisting fate and... offer me a glass of your champagne instead. Trouble sleeping, Baron? It's the sea air. You have to get used to it. I was just looking for something to read. Jakob, why didn't you put anything to read on the Baron's nightstand? You are a strange baron, though. You don't know how to eat snails, nor can you tell a champagne flute from a martini glass. He's not a vampire. I can see his reflection. Simpleton! Now tell me who you really are and what you're doing in my office by candlelight. And don't you dare bore me. My name is Anton Inokentovich Petushkin. But they call me Lyovochka. Cut! Ten minute break! I was given the nickname by the film director Eisenstein. Listen, Sergei, we could film the apple trees. Apples? Nonsense! Let's film the lions. Thank you. Give me that flag. What do you think of Eisenstein? I prefer working with Vertov. Why is this flag lying around? Sorry, comrade cameraman. And what about Pudovkin? I'd rather work with Kuleshov. Dovzhenko? He's great! Damn! Lyovochka, you idiot! You're a stain on OCTOBER! Lyovochka is the diminutive of Leon. In Eisenstein's film OCTOBER I played the hero of the Revolution Leon Trotsky. Eighty minutes until sundown. Fog. Fog. Fog! Excuse me, comrade director. The fog machine is on strike. Sabotage! Quiet on the set! Places, everybody. One, two, blow! It was the best time of my life. Hi, Lyovochka. Hi. Lyovochka. Hi, kids. - How's it going? - Great. I was a person of great respect and moved in the highest social circles. He went through this door right in front of my bicolored eyes. Shortly before the premier a rumor circulated that Stalin himself had come to the studio to visit Eisenstein in the editing room. I was as proud as an engineer. After the premier, I was going to propose to Yevka. During the premier I discovered there was no trace of me in the final version of OCTOBER. I didn't know that Trotsky had fallen into disfavor with Stalin and had to be cut out of the film completely. Naturally, Yevka could no longer afford to be acquainted with me. And things got hard in general. Hide, it's Lyovochka! No one would hire me anymore. And my landlady claimed that the political police had already asked about me. I'd say he's the Baron of Lies. And he didn't even mention his attempt at attempted robbery. I'd like to try my luck in Hollywood. But the proof of my acting skills has been destroyed. I have nothing to show. I've saved nearly enough to book passage on a ship. But I still need money for film footage. I have to shoot some scenes to show the studio bosses how talented I am. So for a few film clips you sneak around my house like a chicken thief? I'll give you the money. But now it's time for bed. Good morning. What are you doing? The algae ash contains iodine. I'm making an ointment out of it. It's good for bites of all kinds. Bites? Come on, you Chink, give us the ointment. But of course, gentlemen. It costs 30 cents. Here. Goodbye. Why did they spit on your algae? They're workers from the cosmetics factory. Seems I'm ruining the price of the factory's ointment. And that has an effect on their pay. Then why do they buy from you? Because at the end of the month the factory ointment is still too expensive for them. I walked by that factory yesterday. Who owns it? The director is Dr. Humburg, the mayor. But he's not the majority shareholder. That's the beautiful Miss Octavia Flambow-Jansen. Come in, sir. Discover our wide selection of products. Thanks. Not today. Come in, gentlemen. Discover our wide selection of products. CHARITY BALL FOR CHINESE FLEA VICTIMS Hey, you! Are you done with that paper? I only smoke the best. Do ships for America sail from here? Yes, from here to Oslo and then on to New York. You can buy tickets from me. I'll give you a special price. Real cheap. How much is a third-class ticket? You lack all class consciousness, you dandy. I have second class tickets for the price of fifth. 450 marks. But the ship leaves in two weeks. Little Klaus thanks you. But you have an exit permit, right? Exit permit? Lots of people want to hightail it out of here, but for once, the cops have the jump on innocent folks like us. You need a stamp, or you won't make it very far. Miss Octavia! Miss Octavia, it's late. Idiot! Nebuchadnezzar! Stop picking on poor Jakob! Moron! Is the farmer's fat turkey still in love with you? It's peculiar. In real life so unremarkable but with an almost magnetic effect on poultry. Moron! "Brussels, August 7. "On the cash market, electricity stocks, "metallurgical and textiles securities, "and 'produits chimiques' were stable. "Bank shares of colonial goods were erratic. "Stocks in the coal sector and transport companies were strong. "On the futures market, Canadian had a poor showing..." Is our fake baron awake already? Our guest has pretty ice-blue eyes. You have to give him that. If I may, doesn't Miss think... Sorry, don't you think it might be somewhat unwise to shelter a film artist? Don't be so small-minded. He's a very charming man. And yet, his drawbacks include a false identity and an attempted robbery. In addition, he himself admitted to being a foreigner. You just lack literary education. So you can't understand people and the hidden workings of the heart. I just don't get it. I just don't get it. Where were you registered until now? In Moscow. I'm just passing through. Well, that doesn't help much. Do you at least have a clearance certificate from a German tax office? No. "No," he says! You're a tough nut to crack. What now? What if you're trying to evade taxes? Ever thought about that? I'm just passing through. - Not on my watch! - On my watch? No way! I bought a ticket. That's your own personal affair. Hammer and sickle, eh? Actually, this is a case only Mayor Humburg can decide. My hands are tied. When can I talk to him? Listen here! That good man has no time for such trifles. - Dr. Humburg? - No! Get on, Baron. We're going to the beach. Officer! Would you take his suitcase to my house? It would be a big help. Of course, Miss Octavia. We're always glad to help, wherever I can. May I? That's nice of you. Get on, Baron. The beach is melancholic in summer, don't you think? Melancholic? I'm reading a book. A woman comes out of the water, and she's just a dot at first. Then she comes closer and you look in her eyes. But she doesn't get any clearer. You imagine whole worlds she could contain, and you're nearly in love already. Then you think maybe there's nothing there. A black hole. But as an artist, you surely know better than I. An actor must be able to read people's souls as clearly as his own. Eisenstein, the director, didn't like a psychological approach. He always said things like, "Look how the tsar's crown glitters." That's the historical materialist approach. That's just what I mean. Things sparkle mysteriously at first. But in the end they're as hollow as turnips. Turnips aren't hollow. My God, your historical materialism is a real plague! You're sitting on a beach with a romantic young woman and you can't think of anything better to do than irritate me with your botanical sophistry? Fresh french fries! But perhaps it's precisely that prosaic nature that intrigues me? On the other hand, you're a true adventurer. I just can't figure you out. Don't you feel a little melancholic when you look out at the waves? And then these morons drown your most melancholic melancholy in their French fry oil. Although one almost envies their carefree nature. Workers have cares too. Sure, they get upset when the milk goes sour. Yet their world is the assembly line. They never look past their own noses. They know how to use their hands, but the big picture... Pardon my proletarian language, but they don't give a shit about it. But I'm talking nonsense. And I didn't even smoke anything today. Shall we go to the water? Damn it! I can't stand the sight of blood. She thinks you're my husband, Baron. My motorcycle! Well, Baron, we'll have to go home on foot. You should notify the police. Let's not let such a trifle ruin the mood. I was going to buy a new one anyway. Let's take those bikes. What a beautiful forest. The problem is it grows so slowly. I may sell it. The forest is yours? A third of it. We're experimenting in the lab with synthetic wood, but... Now I'm the one being prosaic. Tell me a bit about yourself. I know so little about you. Such as... How did you become an actor? That would necessitate a long story. And where did you learn to speak so peculiarly? "That would necessitate..." No one talks like that. Isn't it impolite to indulge in shameless sleepwalking with a lady present? I was a thief once too. In the spring of 1925 I moved to Moscow because working on the kolkhoz was too strenuous for me. But it was not easy to find a dignified occupation there either. For the Revolution had forgotten to abolish wage labor. So I looked for other ways to make money. One day I saw a student in Gorky Park lost in a book. Next to her was a German compass. It would bring a good price on the black market, as there was a shortage of compasses back then. When I passed by the bench an hour later the student was still there, crying bitterly. The sight stung my heart. What's wrong, comrade? A thief stole my compass. And tomorrow I have a hydraulics exam. I was very ashamed. And she was very pretty. Fortunately, a magpie crowed just then. Don't worry. That naughty bird probably pilfered your compass. A bird? Sure. Don't you read fairy tales? The magpie takes everything that glitters to its nest. Do you mind if I take a look? Yevka's real name was Helene, and she was German. Out of enthusiasm for the Revolution, she had come to Moscow to study. At night she'd read me Karl Marx in the original and I learned her language. "The labor necessitated for the production of the cotton, "the raw material of the yarn, "is part of the labor necessitated to produce yarn, "and is therefore contained in the yarn. "The same applies to the labor "necessitated to produce the spindle..." Hey love birds, other comrades are trying to get some sleep! Now I've become a little jealous of your pretty Yevka. And I still don't know how you became an artist. As I said, that would necessitate a long story. Good evening. Jakob! When you're done, please make up the rooms. And don't forget to give our sleepless Baron a book. Certainly. Have you read Proust, Baron? Maybe not. The book is on my ottoman, Jakob. It's spelled P-R-O-U-S-T. As you wish, Miss Octavia. I forbid him to use "Miss," to raise our collaboration to an American level, but the gentleman refuses. Let him have his way. But you won't insist on calling me "Miss," will you? Call me Lyovochka. Back to your story, Lyovochka. If we'd been clever, we both could've lived on Yevka's scholarship. But unfortunately it turned out that she really loved workers. Above all, factory workers. The work was tedious and poorly paid, but I had developed a technique for pulling rotten teeth using the punch press. It gave me extra income. And that enabled me to give Yevka romantic gifts. Thank you. But the work wore me out. I grew irritable, and Yevka and I fought frequently. Until one day the director Eisenstein visited the factory. Would this be a good film location, comrade director? As fate would have it, Eisenstein was suffering from a terrible toothache that day. You remind me of someone... That's how I discovered the most beautiful thing in life: the long breaks between shooting. While the set is being changed for hours there is nothing to do and you can just let your thoughts wander. I finally felt like a human being. A wonderful story. You're like a character from a novel. And I understand you completely. What's sillier than work? Life has to be full of leisure and love. Of poetry and adventure. Otherwise it isn't worth a damn. You must promise to come as Trotsky to my charity ball next week. I would really love to help you with your film clips. Is there a script? No, a few scenes would suffice... Maybe you'll find something in the novel Jakob puts in your room. Do you ever smoke hashish? Would you think me silly if I recited a poem? But it's a bit old-fashioned. It would be very nice. But don't laugh. Overflowing heavens Of squandered stars Flame brilliantly above your troubles Instead of into your pillows Weep up toward them There, at the already weeping, At the ending visage, Slowly thinning out, ravishing Worldspace begins. Who will interrupt, Once you've forced your way there, The current? Octavia? What are you doing there in the dark? Weren't you staying at the Excelsior? Why is there still no telephone out here? Hans! Franz! Bring the suitcases in. It's outrageous. The room was booked for tomorrow! Everyone knows I only arrive on Wednesdays! I'll have to put up with you for a night. Won't you introduce the gentleman? Oh yes, may I introduce Baron Kobersky from St. Petersburg? My aunt, Erkentrud Flambow. Baron Kobersky. It's a pleasure. My sister married a Count Wolperdinger. - Do you know him? - I'm afraid not. An important dynasty in this country. My brother-in-law's uncle was a close advisor to the Kaiser. "For a long time I used to go to bed early. "Sometimes, when I put out my candle, my eyes would close so fast "that I had not even time to say, 'I'm going to sleep.'" 2. Diary of a Personal Assistant For a long time I thought you had to be rich to have success with women. Well, not with all women. I did kiss Rosa from the factory once, But she's poor herself, and it was dull. With Miss Octavia, however, my heart quivers even when I serve her eggs in the morning. I may lack literary education, but writers themselves also seem to lack all education. In that French book, a child simply writes everything that occurs to its child's mind. Yet Miss Octavia thinks the book is fascinating. So I'm also going to write down everything I've seen and thought. So far I've thought little. Or differently. Because I'm often tired, especially after a flea has bit me. But the child in the book is also tired. It's a lot about beds and how people lie in them. And yet the book is very dear to Miss Octavia. The men she wants to kiss get it placed on their nightstand. When you're tired, you only need to write it down. Then you're no longer a simpleton but a man of letters. Hi, Rosa. Nice to see you. Where are you going? - To get some eggs from our tenant. - Your tenant? So you've gotten Miss Flambow-Jansen to marry you? Very funny. I meant it figuratively. Don't be angry. I just worked the night shift. I'm tired. I'm also tired, but I'm still polite. Look. Chinese fleas. Some people say they're vampire bites. The newspaper said vampires were just a myth to cover up for bad hygiene. Are you kidding me? No offence, I'm affected as well. So high society practices bad hygiene as well? You turn my words inside out like an umbrella. You're just in love with Flambow-Jansen. I've had enough. My feelings for Miss Flambow-Jansen are purely professional. Then why do you like being exploited by her? She doesn't exploit me. Miss Octavia is a wonderful person. Capitalism exploits all workers. Maybe. But I'm from a bourgeois family. My father was a secondary customs assistant. I learned that reading Marx. In the past, people only worked enough each day until they produced enough value for that day. With machines, that value is produced in just two hours, but we must keep working anyway, which creates surplus value. And that's what makes the capitalists rich. I don't produce anything. And certainly no surplus value. Want to come to the beach later? Today is the big Socialist swim meet. We could get some ice cream. Another time. I'm very busy professionally right now. I'll tell you what you are. A brain-dead servant. Leave me in peace. You just lack literary education. So you don't understand people and the hidden workings of the heart. Tell me, Jakob, seeing that you enjoy such a good relationship with Miss Flambow-Jansen, might she perhaps consider exercising some patience with my rent? It's the global market... My hens shit out one egg after another but you can't live on that anymore. Then there's that Chinaman who has ruined everyone's appetite. Could you put in a good word for me? I'll see what I can do. ...a Polack, of course. And unemployed to boot. You've already stolen West Prussia. Now Poznan and Upper Silesia. Will your bloodlust never be sated? But tell Miss Octavia not to worry. The criminal will not escape the punishment he deserves. She'll be pleased. You can take the motorcycle too. Okay, it's just... I don't have a driver's license. Do you want to block traffic? I've noticed that thoughts and events often don't fit together. On the way home, I pondered the telephone we'd be getting soon and that there'd be no more pleasant strolls to the telegraph office, nor cigarettes on the way. They'd be replaced by urgent calls, so there'd be less nice things and more dumb ones. Until there'd be no time left for thinking at all. Help! Help! I wondered what all the running was about, also in terms of what I would write in my diary. So I went to see, whereas in the past I would have just wondered. She's still breathing. It was close. What's wrong with her? When very thirsty vampires attack very delicate women, it can be life-threatening. Make sure you take good care of dear Miss Octavia! So, is the matter settled? No offense, Dr. Humburg. Stealing a bicycle from one of our best customer's sons... Is it the newest practical joke, or did I miss something? I just borrowed it. Enough of that! If the Baron found out... He was there. But his aristocratic soul didn't suspect a thing. You need a man like that. Stop bothering me. I beg your pardon, Miss Octavia, but you must get to safety. Calm down, Jakob. What has upset you so? Rosa, a worker was lying in the field half-dead. It was the vampire. His bites usually just make you tired, but they can be deadly. What is this horror story? Chinese fleas, Mrs. Flambow. A plague of the uneducated classes. Due to bad hygiene. But common folk tend to suspect the supernatural. No flea can bite like that. It must have been a vampire! But Jakob, vampires only exist in movies. Maybe it was a fox. Or a crime of passion. That's no rarity in the proletariat. Still, we should take the young man's concerns seriously. These fleas can indeed be dangerous to those with weak constitutions. The victim had clear bite marks, I presume? On her neck perhaps? Yes. Very clear. Chinese fleas, no doubt. What can be done? A bourgeois lifestyle is usually protection enough. What do you mean? Jakob, please go wash your hands. I always wash my hands, yet... Gross! Do you have these Jewish fleas too? Goodness, no! But the workers think the fleas are an invention. Jakob, I've studied this phenomenon closely. Do you doubt science? Of course not. You should wash your hands if you had contact with the victim. Certainly. Thank you. Do you believe in vampires, Baron? Such stories were also told under the tsar. Dr. Hamburg's explanation was certainly sound. The whole vampire thing must be humbug. Octavia looked at me scornfully, as if I were an imbecile. Now I'll have to prove my indispensability by being even more diligent. The biggest threat to the German soul is doubtless unemployment insurance. Simple, uneducated people naturally tend to frivolity and neglect of duty. The Good Lord created a clever antidote to that: hunger. But when the natural compulsion to work is lessened since true hunger hardly exists anymore, then... My God! What a clumsy servant you have! Stop calling him a servant. He's my personal assistant. You know, Baron, Dr. Humburg recommended that I always hire two servants. It creates a competitive atmosphere and thus a lasting motivation. What do you say? You're right. And it works. Hans and Franz fit together like cogs in a machine. Do you really think a baron cares how you run your household, Auntie? She's a good girl, actually. She speaks three languages, is an excellent pianist, and, despite occasionally shooting off her mouth, she is always dutiful. The product of my modest upbringing, as you can guess. Of course. And don't people owe everything to their upbringing, Baron? I agree in full. You see, Octavia? The Baron and I understand one another. And yet in affairs of the heart, the personal assistant is at times a step ahead, since he knows what my rival doesn't, namely if her aunt likes something, Miss Octavia stops liking it As an aristocrat, you can't share my aunt's bourgeois values? - Well... - Pay no heed to her insolence. It's her solitary heart speaking. It's high time she got married. My dear aunt, I wanted to tell you some important news. I've decided to move to Cairo. To Cairo? What are you going to do in Cairo? I'm going to work as a waitress. As a waitress? For the Negroes? Jakob will accompany me. Perhaps we'll even marry? Idiot! Nebucha... Nebuchadnezzar! What are you doing up there? Imbecile! You imbecile! Get Nebuchadnezzar down right now! It's just... I'm apt to experience vertigo. Don't worry. I'll save the bird. A baron in the trees? No! Hans! Franz! Get that animal down! I'll take care of it. But be careful, please! My hopes of marriage were dashed. - Here's your bird. - Oh, thank you. Jakob, will you take him to the house? Who could that be at this hour? Imagine you wanted a painting by Renoir in the proper size. Or a ton of monazite sand from Brazil. You wonder, "Who should I call?" And someone says, "Try Bonin." And indeed, it turns out he knows just the man in Rio de Janeiro. Yes, I like to think that I know everyone you can even think of. - You're exaggerating. - Try Auntie. He's telling the truth. Okay, then... Do you know Otto von Wolperdingen? Naturally. Of ancient Hessian nobility. Until 1917 he had coffee plantations in German East Africa. He sold them for a profit before the war ended and then bought shares in a diamond mine in the Belgian Congo. He lives with your sister Dörte in Rüsselsheim. You see? Amazing! It is indeed impressive. The Baron did not know him. You're not familiar with the German nobility? Certainly, but... I met your brother-in-law while working for Mussolini on Bora Bora. What a wonderful coincidence. Well, forgive the expression, but that old jackass almost ruined the entire mission. Don't you always say that everyone over 40 should be shot? With the exception of your dear aunt and our Dr. Humburg, of course. In such cases, physical attraction is usually decisive. Does she feel any for me at all? The Baron has nice eyes and an exotic hairstyle. Bonin embodies all the erotic virtues of the German race. Am I simply too ugly for her? But ugly people tend to settle with other ugly people, whereas I only like Octavia, so I can hardly be ugly. You know, Bonin, I'm a doctor of pharmacy. There are astounding parallels between the symmetrical structure of a word play and the protein shell of a virus genome. Kant himself considered the possibility that a race's sense of humor is related to its gut flora. Mmm, won't you give us a sample? You mentioned Rüsselsheim. It calls to mind an erotic epigram that was, listen for the alliteration, the spring spa splash. A woman got a telegram: "My husband's back from Amsterdam!" Said her stud from Rüsselsheim: "I pulled my dick out just in time." Dr. Humburg! You have to see it on paper to... Where were we? Bora Bora. Aren't they Negroes too? A sub-species. Phenotypically, they're especially pleasing. The women in particular are stunning. You don't say. They should be in movies. Bonin, did I tell you that I'm going to be in a movie soon? A movie? A movie? The Baron is an artist and a filmmaker. I'm producing it. Well, well! What's it about? A vampire story with a romantic element. I'll be playing the lead. The Baron will be the hero and my lover. The Baron? That must be a joke! Um... no. A vampire movie? Excellent! A vampire movie? Isn't that a bit vulgar? In support of your aunt, I might note that Hegel completely omits film in his aesthetics. How horribly reactionary you all are! And when will the filming of your masterpiece begin, Baron? - Uh... - In one or two days. - In two days? - You bet! Jakob, you should have gone to town to cable Berlin for the material! - How late is it? - It's 3:30. The office closes in a hour. Go with him, Baron, so that the imbecile gets it right. I don't like one bit that the Baron is going to play her lover. On the other hand, filming might provide an opportunity to show off my literary talent. Then again, she called me an imbecile twice today. But don't they say that dumb fucks good? Where did that idiot with the parachute come from? We met him this winter on a ski trip. Of course, I'm not sure if that saying is known in educated circles and thus if she would be able to apply it to me. Plus, one must strip naked to make love. But how could I since I'm covered with, if not vampire bites, then certainly flea bites? Do you believe in vampires? No. Wouldn't the vampire be the more interesting role for you? The lover could also be played... by me, for example. You're the cameraman. I see. Then who will play the vampire? Why not Mr. Bonin? I'm sure Miss Octavia would love him to bite her neck. Cut! What are you doing, Octavia? - Isn't it silly for him to bite my foot? - I think it's nice. Can't he give me the classic neck bite? It'd be more realistic. And scarier too, right? There's literary justification for it, too. I'll do it however you want. - Wouldn't it be unpleasant... - Oh, please - But... - You're not jealous, are you? We'll do one in the neck. Cut. "Samuel's brow is noble and pure, "his eyes glitter like two drops of coffee, "his nose is teasing and scoffing, "his chin square and despotic, "his hair pretentiously Raphaelesque." Look! Move over. Where'd you find that? How are we supposed to cut it? With this. May I? Is there more wine? Here. What's our next scene? A spooky melon burial, maybe? I'd rather do a vampire taking a nap. The film artists are having a party! Bonin! We're taking a break. Sit down. When's it over? I'd like to watch some filming. The light is very nice right now. We should do the final scene. Oh, yeah! Wasn't it slated for tomorrow? What kind of cameraman are you? It's the light that matters, not your silly schedule. Wouldn't it be more elegant to leave this scene to the audience's imagination? Camera. And action. Another time from over there. Don't we have enough? Oh, Jakob, you don't know what love is. But I know what it is, because I love Octavia. When we kissed she felt something too. Of course she has moral doubts about me since I'm a proletarian. But when she sees the movie she'll still want to marry me. Our life will be nothing but love and leisure. I'll even give up acting. Soon there will be talking pictures, and there will be lines to memorize. I won't mind if you stay on as her assistant. But you couldn't just walk into her bedroom in the morning. For she won't be alone in there anymore. I think this is a good spot. Dear Diary, I've written everything down and become a man of letters. I've lived the life of a film artist and spoken freely in high company. And yet she kisses him, and still ignores me out of sheer habit. But now that I'm a writer a return to my old existence seems intolerable, whereas I used to be content just to fluff her pillows on Sundays. They say he has 17 slant-eyed children. Still no one stops him doing his illicit work, ruining my pharmacy, without batting a slanted eye. It's your fault too, butterball. You weren't even invited to the charity ball. Hey, isn't that... Miss Flambow-Jansen's assistant! What's he doing in the rocks? Very strange. Perhaps you could approach him about an invitation? I can't just wake him up! Butterball! Excuse me, sir... 3. Wrong Life Cannot Be Lived Rightly Baron! Baron! Please excuse the interruption. It's just that we heard about the tragedy with Mr. Jakob. And to honor Mr. Jakob's memory we slaughtered our turkey Karla who loved him so much. To remember him by. Thank you. Bravo, princess! Very elegant! That'll be hard to beat. Be quiet and give me a ball. Sorry, you hit the last one into the bushes. Don't you have a caddie to fetch it? Alas, my assistant Jakob died. And I haven't seen Lyovochka since this morning. That strange, taciturn Russian? Who is he anyway? Octavia now has a proletarian pet. It's all the rage. You should also get yourself a singing miner or a poet baker. Sure! Where do I find one? You're just a bigmouth. Lyovochka risked his life for art. Indeed, your aunt was very angry about the whole movie thing. But it was you she wanted to kill. Stalin himself wanted to hang him. Was he such a bad actor? For political reasons. How boring. Considering the poor quality of Soviet gallows a game of golf with you, dear Octavia, poses a greater threat to life and limb. Earlier you almost knocked out one of poor Dr. Humburg's eyes. But let's toast already. I'm going to look for Lyovochka. Am I interrupting? Of course not. What are you doing? Making my special recipe. It's a surprise. These potatoes are very interesting. We don't have potatoes like these. They're incredibly long and thin. More like carrots. Look how thick the peel is. The interesting question is how much boiling they necessitate. Excuse me, please. Bon appétit! This stew is delicious! Poor Jakob didn't just die like a vegetarian. He cooked like one too. Biologically speaking, mushrooms are closer to animals than vegetables. According to his own rules... he shouldn't have eaten it. How nice. My assistant is gone, and you're amusing yourselves. And the poor Baron has debased himself in the kitchen for me. I find it utterly shameful what you've agreed to do out of friendship for my niece. Dr. Humburg, let's finally toast the purchase of your first block of shares. It is a great honor for me. To paraphrase our great poet Geibel, If you count each drop of sweat No blessings of fortune will you get What was the name of your wife's rich uncle? - Rüdiger. - Well, then. To Uncle Rüdiger. I regret I must return to a disagreeable topic. I mentioned the displeasure our focus on exports is causing in the workforce... It's such a nice evening. Isn't there a more interesting topic than the factory? Lyovochka could tell us a tale from Revolutionary Russia. The Revolution has taken its toll on him. Rationalization has intensified processes for which we can't always offer adequate incentive, which may result in the forming of a workers' council. Excuse me? In itself it's no cause for panic. Most of the workers are moderate Social Democrats, but... there seem to also be scattered extremists who reject our democratic economic system on principle. Communists or fascists? Communists, I fear. A Russian cookbook was found. It began circulating as a birthday present. The dedication contains verses by Mayakovsky. This is irksome. At least you can talk to fascists. Can they be shot? A well-tempered cruelty to restore order? - Right before the elections? - I'm tired of this. A lady from Dresden must spend her old age in the grasp of Jews and Frenchmen, and you democrats are waving flags of peace? I had to fire Hans. Imagine it! That rascal stole my hairpin. Strange. You know I dreamt about Hans recently? It was very strange. His eyeball was dripping like a runny egg. But we couldn't find a spoon. Feel free to make a suggestion for once. Want to end up like him? Maybe you could give a lecture in the factory. What? Tell them a bit what Communism is like from the victim's perspective. A fantastic idea! But will the proletarian mob listen to a baron? He can say he's a persecuted writer. I have the title: "They Even Took My Fountain Pen." He could go on a lecture tour! Although I really did lose my fountain pen. You don't say! The first time's a bit strange, but you'll get the hang of it. I have a little stage fright. It seems capital is a burden, too. A delight, Humburg. It's a delight. Soon you won't be able to get enough of it. Can I ask you a question? Before I bought my block of shares, did you drink mine too? Go on now, you old ninny! "Rosa was lying in the field half-dead. It was the vampire... "It can be life-threatening for delicate young women "(like Miss Octavia)." Help! Help! Help! Help! What happened? The pharmacist and his friends were playing a practical joke. But they seem to have forgotten me. What are you doing with that? A new movie? Do you believe in vampires? Real vampires? I'd rather not. - I saw him. - You? This morning. In my room. I have to find him so he doesn't harm Octavia. Hello, my dear film artists. Why do you still have that stake, Baron? We're looking for the real vampire. Really? And I thought the Baron was one himself. - Me? - Yes. Because of your title. Yet the mere sight of your potato nose should have told me that you're nothing more than a court jester. I'm done talking to you. Why so sensitive, my dear Baron? God almighty! Look out, Baron! Where did we leave off? But Marx explicitly says that the capitalist sucks blood. But we already discussed that Marx is not interested in denouncing individual capitalists. Instead, he polemically identifies the unfettered form of capitalist production in its pure, abstract state. Without democratic regulations, so to speak. But there is a ruling class that Marx wants to abolish. Oh, man! You're always bothering us with your dumb questions. Shut up already. You know what? I'm sick of this bozo brigade. Speak of the devil. Really, Bonin! Drinking blood that doesn't belong to you! I'm sorry. I should have asked permission. I was so exhausted this morning. It was so loud last night in the hotel. Then I saw your actor lying here, and since my father's stocks make me a future Flambow shareholder... Relax! That's what thirst does to you. They say Socialism would liberate us from it. I wonder what it would be like. But you don't want to trade after all. The blood would just flow into some field. That's no good either. Better not to think of it. And yet I'm embarrassed. Shall we forget it over coffee at the Excelsior? Let's have a drink here instead. Too bad he has that moldy cabbage taste, right? You're an idiot. But you know... I'm glad I saw you. I... wanted to tell you something. You're moving to his kolkhoz? Stop. I really like him. He's just somewhat... awkward. Is he a good kisser at least? But I wanted to talk to you too. Really? Since arriving, I haven't been able to find the right moment. And in your bed. I can't think clearly. You go first. I've long wished to have a serious talk with you. Ever since that time in St. Moritz I've hoped that... the liking we have for one another might develop into something more. Some of your statements have led me to speculate that you might also be open to that. So I wanted to talk to you before leaving for Budapest. Because I thought you might want to come with me. Oh, Bonin, you've read my mind. You show up, and I feel dizzy. And then you're gone again, before we've had a chance to talk. Instead I search for secret signs in your words, gestures, and glances. Then I ponder and hesitate. Yet it could be so easy. Speak freely. Tell me what's in your heart. I'll come to the point. A few days ago I was called by an old business partner, Heideck. He told me a Hungarian scientist had developed a new technology for radio transmission of moving images, a kind of tele-vision. A ways off, but you can see the possibilities for military and advertising. The patent royalties are accordingly expensive. And since I lack liquidity at the moment and since my father simply refuses to die I thought of you. That is, I thought of us. Brainless leftists! Can I be of assistance? We've come to arrest the vampire. Miss Flambow-Jansen is the bloodsucker! Octavia? I understand your surprise. But her behavior has long been suspicious. She didn't even invite the pharmacist and his wife to the charity ball. It's for vampires only. Nonsense. True. Dönitz is a petty bourgeois. But Schnösl the worker saw everything. Like what? Her sucking your blood. Why didn't I see it? You were unconscious. He dreamt it up. Where's he hiding anyway? He's in shock. He can barely speak. And you believe him? Where are you from anyway? He's a foreigner! And a baron to boot! Maybe you're in cahoots with her. You really think she sucks your blood, and two days later she puts on a charity ball? Where's the sense in that? He has a point. Plus, the young lady gives us work. Whereas a vampire only thinks about itself. Without her there'd be no pharmacy student summer camp. Plus, our young lady caught a chill from yearning and has been in bed for two days. Poor thing! I know all about yearning. Bourgeois chatter. But our comrade gave his word! A "comrade"? To his discredit, Schnösl belongs to a Marx reading group. Karl Marx? A Marx-critical Marx reading group. Enough. Schnösl saw it. You were lying in the sand. She was next to you. Did he see her bite him? The facts speak for themselves. Even if it's just a bad metaphor, she still exploits us. Let's grab her and take the factory. Life belongs to us! Hurrah! Don't mix things up. Political opinions belong in the ballot box. No, no, no. Hold on a second. I usually don't believe anything Schnösl says. And that goes double for dames. Nevertheless, I'd like to say: Let's go. Hold Your proletarian hands Tight on the world's throat! Property owners will be "de-propertied" today. Excuse me? That's out of the question. A Socialist society will develop organically, once we have established an unbroken international telephone network. Maybe we should ask Moscow for advice. - Damn Russians! - Right again. While we're debating, the vampire keeps on sucking. Let's get her, then we'll see! And how did he manage to observe a dangerous vampire that no one else has ever seen? An invisible hand pulled him to the scene. An invisible hand? It sounds strange but that's what happened. At least that's what Schnösl told us. He was drunk. I know how much aspirin that red rascal buys. Octavia is innocent. I'm on the real vampire's trail. Explain. I've set a trap. Give me a couple days, and I'll bring you the real bloodsucker. So the young lady has time to escape? Midnight tomorrow. The vampire better be on the table, or else... Tomorrow is the charity ball. Midnight tomorrow. There you are. Know what the worst thing in the world is? That no one knows how to love anymore. That's not true. It is! All relationships are based on calculation and self-interest. Even you only tolerate me because I'm funding your movie. The movie doesn't matter. Leave me alone. Finish the joint. I'm going to bed. I'm just dropping off your costume. Where have you been? Let's have a drink. What a stupid, shitty party! We have to get drunk. Why are you carrying the movie around? We'll send it to UFA. Or I'll come with you to Hollywood. I can't stand it here anymore. When does the next ship leave? But I wanted to introduce you to someone. My dear Princess Sherbatskaya, may I introduce you to a compatriot and a good friend? The exile Leon Trotsky. Princess? What's wrong? Princess? It was just a joke. Good evening, Lyovochka. I hope I didn't frighten you. What's it like to be dead? You see things clearer when you're not so caught up in life. But... may I walk with you a bit? Of course. What are you doing with the film? I have to save Octavia. Let her go. Never! I don't want to offend you but class relations will keep you apart. That's why I'll marry her. But she won't marry you. At best, you'll stay her jester. Fine. You're already polishing her floors. That's temporary. Listen, you blind garden chair! Octavia is the vampire. You're just jealous. Then I ask you, why was she the only one not bitten? And why does she love garlic mousse and sun-bathing? What about her sensitivity? Her literary taste? Her individualism? Her longing for love? And what if she's a vampire anyway? I'll never get closer to a life worth living. I'm going to save her. Wait! Do you remember the year 1917? No! Before the Revolution you lived in a poor village. You were poor too. The best fields belonged to the large landowner Tolstoy. To live, you had to toil in his fields as a day laborer. Do you remember the forest? The best mushrooms grew there in late summer. But the men of the forest's private owner kept a close watch on his private mushrooms. You'd been living in a rat-infested debtors' prison for a year when you were released to paint the forest owner's fence. Revolution! Revolution! Do you remember how you felt when the paperboy showed up? In a frenzy of enthusiasm you went to the city. Only you forgot to bring something to eat. And you had no money, of course. And since you'd smoked a week's ration of tobacco on the way you were a bit dizzy. Are you hungry, comrade? Long live the Revolution! All cauliflowers now belong to everyone. So my cauliflower is your cauliflower. Remember the hope that man's exploitation of man would finally come to an end? That hope was bullshit. Why not learn from past mistakes and try again? Kiss my ass! The Chinaman! Please tell Miss Flambow-Jansen we're sorry. We're ashamed to have suspected a compatriot. We must have been suffering from sunstroke. Or from Marxism. We know what we have to do now. We are the people. Hurrah! But comrades, think a minute! That was just some shabby movie. We don't tolerate pessimists. But... Come on, let's go get the Chink!
