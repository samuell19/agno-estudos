BARRIER Scenario and direction Director of photography Music Leading players - As a student... - Watch it, or we'll punch you up. As a student I sold myself to the state! Now, I'll choose my buyer. The State's not so disgusting! Who drives the nice cars? People like us? I can't bear to look at those success men, their cars, their girls... Wy can't I have all that now? Must I wait until I'm old to get such a car, such a girl? I'll gladly give my life for my country when I'm 5O. Not now! In our cynical and unidealistic generation... ...in spite of everything, romantic impulses manifest themselves. Win something by your own youthful efforts, fight for something! Even for cars and girls, but not a pension at your age! You've had 15 years of education and you can't do one more year? You've deprived someone of a place! Yes, it's disgusting! I've broken down. Should I cry? So I broke down. But who's driving the good cars? Men like us? First see who they were before they got those cars. Defend yourself, wonder boy! They want something from you! We were four... He's gone! Now, we are three. I don't have to play. Take my money as a grant. From me! We don't know our individual contributions from the first year. How can we share out? It's a lot, we must play for it. Winner takes all! I want one thing clear. If I win the piggy it's ours - common property. And you? Do you play for all or yourself? Don't be shy! If I win I'll take the lot! I play for all. Untie me. Untie me... let me say goodbye to you. Untie me. Feet off! My bed! See, I want a bed of my own, to trample on. Not state property! All my belongings go into this suitcase. In 1 O years you'll met to compare your purchases. That'll be your biography! In 1 O years you'll arrive where I am now. I'm sparing myself 1 O years gradual disillusion... ...surrender of ambition, of ideals... Another word and I'll smash you! In our cynical and unidealistic generation... in spite of everything romantic impulses manifest themselves. We must... We ought to join the bloodstream of society! You'll smash me? Multiwitamin - to soothe your jangling nerves! Here, take the pack! - And when they explode think... - Of you lot? No, what a bum you are! At last you'll be able to lie and look at the ceiling. Aim well! BECOME A BLOOD DONOR Fellow students! You know what blood is... ...and why you should be the first to give it... ...so that you give aid even before you qualify as doctors! The last week of the Lent is also Blooddonor Week! You're the first volunteer. Please, appeal to the others. Christ gave his blood and life! Give blood at least! - Not this door! - But here I... Oh, it's you! Yes, he's here. I'm getting married. - Got a pen? - Father, I'm getting married tomorrow. Wipe your face. Seal it. You've been up too long today. Do you need anything? Now I'll have... Deliver it today. See that it's opened in your presence. I don't need anything... I have television. I broke down. Can anyone else do better? Are you a student? Why have you come so late? Put it away somewhere. You must start at this end. The steel wool. I took you for a student, but you didn't say... - It's a joke. - Please don't do any more. Some students were to do the clearing, you can't rely on anything. Now, just let me think... I don't know if I can tell which one it is. Look for yourself. There's only one, very old, tsarist. Judge? My dear Judge... ...please take the cards from Father's hands... ...and let him grip the receiver instead. To a dance? But it's Easter Saturday. Well, yes, I suppose it's all right after midnight. Other side of the bridge? Oh, At the new place! That'll be marvellous! Will it be open? Listen, someone's come here from the onsign... ...the one At the pensioners' home. He worked it out exactly... ...he's returned the loan plus the interest, 3OO exactly. Perhaps you would prefer to hale cash instead? More than the repayment, of course. Five hundred? - Six hundred? - Now I begin to understand. It's supposed to be a present to me... ...on the occasion... - I'll ring back. There's a dentist next door - take no notice. Why such a face? We've got a buyer for it, haven't we? There's some dirt on your face... there, too... You should wash. You'll find it, all will come off with this. Best of all, take a bath. You'll have time to think about the sabre... I know what your game is! But I'm in love, I'm getting married! What do you think you're playing at, switching off the lights? I haven't, there's a power failure. How dare you take a handle from there? Maybe he deserves it! - Got a cigarette? - Yes, but I haven't any matches. There's an easier way. It'll lose its temper, it'll break, you'll see. Now, what will you do? The snow was my idea. It's smouldering! Those in favour, raise their candles! Tank you! Those against! Please, miss! You know that place the other side of the bridge? The New place? Well, we could play a joke... ...on my friends from the Academy... I'm pretending that I'm getting married tomorrow. Now I have to meet them there with my fiancee. Wouldn't it be funny if I showed them you? After all you could be my fiancee. We could go to that place together. But I haven'f finished work yet. But wait a moment, won't you? - Still up, sisters? - We're waiting for the resurrection. Room 512 please. Come and meet my fiancee. I'm sitting here, feeling rather stupid. At that place they won't let you into without a tie. I'll fetch her now. Telephone for you. How do you like her? What? What have you told her? They've allerted us, like an emergency service. So that someone who loses faith, like a leg... ...can find first aid here. - I'm going to wait. - Waiting costs money, too! They wait, they get drunk, and what can we do about it? - I'm waiting for money, in a suitcase. - That's worth waiting for. I want to make an impression, but I don't know about wines. For 5O I'll call you Councellour, 1 OO Chief, 2OO Chairman, 5OO Minister. - One hundred. - Yes, chief? Dirty! Clean! You have a chance to give me a good start. It's my first day. You are alone, you need friendship. All the better if I could be Her... The Girl Friend. You'll discover everything here for a single zloty. A Slave. I love my husband very much but we've just quarrelled, I told him I've had enough of him and we haven't spoken for a week. I don't know how it will end, yet nothing... All in good repair, like the one beginning a new life! He means me. Sir, I used to come here... and drink drops from the glasses, but now I have a wage! Sir, I have a profession, a secure existence. Got a cigarette? It's a special cigarette... the last! Ladies and gentlemen, all of us are in the best of moods! Those not here yet will arrive soon! Lent ends at midnight. We'll all have a good time! Here's the famous... And here's the one beginning a new life! Well, who else? Our star! Ladies and gentlemen, our star! She's not quite ready, she's still in her bath! Ladies and gentleman, you can hear the splashing! Something specially for us? No, I can't, I haven't finished this yet. We understand, the star isn't quite ready... but a little something? Please, leave me alone, I'm tired. It must be very tiring, we know - but please, just for us! Turn around, drop your mask Retreat! To those days! When you could have been God knows where! When you could have been God knows who! Now he, after evil days... Or after something like youth... Or love... With hand to throat he wants to begin again! Longs again to be God knows who! With hand to throat he wants to begin again! Longs again to be God knows who! And he straightens his tie I put snow in but it still smoulders. - What was that? - Some cabaret numer. I put snow in because I couldn't open it. - It's not worth putting out. - Why carry it then? To be different from those who carry briefcases. But you were afraid I might go off with it, weren't you? - Smells like a good cygar, Chief. - It's a suitcase. But a good one, Chief! Ah, money has arrived! Allow me, Madame... your fur. Was it a time bomb? No... a piece of cake fell inside. They think you're mad! Would it help to get the lady blind... with our field glasses? No, champagne when everyone is here. - As a clou. - As a what? It stopped mouldering. Serve it at the end, with a knife. As a clou! - And what now? - Change the tablecloth. And then? The usual. I understand, Chief. The bums are drinking away their piggy bank! The usual thing? We are not regulars. We'll give ourselves away if we don't do better than that! Dont't worry, I'll lend you some, if your piggy runs out. I could be dressed for clearing the car. Do we have one? - What's that? - A clean cloth. We have more than a car! The first for the gate... the second for the villa... the third for the... garage. The fourth for the car door... the fifth for ignition... - The sixth? - I've forgotten. How come? I clean carpets in villas - here's one of the moths. Show me. You could wash trains. One of our crowd married a Frenchman. What is a Frenchman? We don't say an engeneer or a driver form France - just a Frenchman! She doesn't know his job, she can't converse with him. Or take his story, for instance. Lately my life has ceased to be a nightmare. Why stare? Because I haven't made good? Where does it say everyone has to make good? How could you stoop to this in your prime? It was going to rain... I was deep in thought... And suddenly someone put into my hand... two zlotys. A slight difference of gesture... ...and what a consequence... Sir, I'll make a fortune out of this! Please, as a token of gratitude! Sir, you're bound to buy it in this shape! It's them - don't look! Now I'll tell you what they said on the phone. They're coming to smash your face in. - Afraid, Mister? - Drop the formalities! Afraid? - Two beers. - And invite him. Chief? Hide your boots under the table! Please, get my shoes from my fur. Cheaply dressed, but reeks of money! I'll smash him now! I really love her! Isn't she magnificent? Would you love her without her money? We met on a tram, love at first sight. - You travel by tram? - Occasionally. - Don't be cynical! - There was a questionnaire: Your greatest day dream! I said I dreamt of a record. At least of Opel Rekord. But our car is better than a Rekord, eh? I prefer an engine's roar to a thudding heart! I'm more interested in cylinder valves than diseased mitrals. What a ham! Are you so much of a swine? You want to gain 1 O years of life' you'll lose 1 O years of youth! Come on, let's be sociable. Let's dance. I can't. Your boots show them it's untrue. What's true and what isn't? Everything's untrue. Only it's a pity we haven't time to fall in love. Everybody had to buy one! Seven hundred! For the sabre. Eight hundred! They paid for the beer. And sait to tell you they'd smash Chief's face anyway! Where are you going? - Defend yourself! - Hallo! Divorced yet? Defend yourself first! - Divorced! And you? - Getting married! What if she had long fingers? These youngsters are driving licences but not cars! The older you get the more you need money! Portrait photos are out! Now it's Jesuses! I enter a cottage and find a space on the wall. All I say is,, blessed by Christ". Then a quick nail in the wall and it's hanging up! Then I ask for 35O zloties. Then the peasant drags me to see the dozens he's got already! So I take mine down saying ,, they don't want you Jesus". Even atheists fall for that. I hang it back and pocket the cash. Disasters are profitable for exhibitions. You know: Art! Know what she was shouting? Help! Know this trick for picking up girls? What a headache! Have you got an aspirin? - If you get angry, you'll spoil the fun. - The fun is over! Do you know that man? He's gone. Where do you live? Why? Let's say: The young tramworkers' hostel. What would our love be like? Walks on frosty days... student dances... Do you know him? - He's looking at you! - Take it easy! I'll qualify and be sent to work where there are no trams. - Who is he? - My husband. So what? Is he too short? Too old? Not prepossessing enough? - He looks as if he had to buy you... - What do you know? What, he was in the war? Propellers were not made to cool drunks! They can make up their own biographies, war heroes... I'm three years short of pretence! At seven you could throw a molotov cocktail - not at four! That's him! No, it isn't! How can one tell war heroes apart? My father's like the one who sells Girlfriend. He was wonderful, but after the war... Sometimes I wisit my father, he's a pensioner. He bought back that sabre. He wanted to give me something that... Every sixth man died in the war. They have their songs. What are ours? "I'll manage by myself?" You are like this when you are young! Full like this bottle! And you shake it. You shake it, and it bubbles and churns inside you. And then... Remember, you'll die one day and you won't be resurected! Excuse me, they brought someone in the ambulance... - What name? - Not long ago... - Particulars! - Girlfriend! - Was it someone close to you? - Wy do you say,, was it"? Her father? - I want to be a blood donor! - Sorry, I think you've just left a bar. Come back after you've slept it off. That's the sort of blood donor we get. Let's look down on it all. - On what? - My students' hostel. There'll be a dance there this afternoon. I'll wait for you at the entrance at 5 o'clock. You're so romantic because it's down and high up. O geese! You get fat and lose birds' ambition to fly. Geese! I understand you. Tell me how things are with you, where do you really live? There, where the dog barks. I'll probably marry, because I need a home. Man built this to detach himself from earth for a few seconds. Mount! Where's the boss? I want this tram in service, do you hear? Oh yes? That's no concern of mine, thank you. It's dawn, you are on the afternoon shift and you say it's nothing? So what is it? - Maybe I could do now... - And this afternoon? It's no concern of mine, but you must have a reason. And you say it's nothing! Easter holiday schedule - what if someone lets me down? Who can I count on? Try to change with someone, but I want your tram in service. I got up early, and getting up is the worst part. If I change shift with you, I'll have to get up again. You said you love me' take my turn. - Don't love me? - Won't take your turn! Is it important? Take my turn? Have I ever asked you to do anything for me? It's a good thing you're here - you can help us. We've been working on it all night. Will you help? DEAD Quite an echo, eh? Do you want a certificate to get off work? You were talking about me last night. Yes, you were. - I said you were my husband. - Undress, then. Nothing's wrong. I have to write something here. You... I've never examined you! Come on, undress. I won't look. - I only said it to annoy him. - Well, undress. Ah, you love him! - He's getting married today. - So, why the certificate? He might not. You need a fortune-teller, not me! He loves me, he loves me not... Shall I undress? I once had to deal with a girl who fell under the tram. She'd hobbled herself... ...tied red ribbon around her knees so as to walk gracefully! When the tram came she forgot she could not run. I must look into your eyes! Yes, nothing's wrong! The examination is concluded. I know you switch duty to be here during my shift. A cat crossed my path on the way here. So I said to the cat... You, cat, why do you cross my path? And he replied... No, he didn't he just drew back. You see, the cat understood, but not you! Here, you won't have to go to work. I don't suppose I'll meet him anyway. - Then go to work. - Then I certainly won't meet him You'll met him, you won't! You love him, you don't. Cat! All I can do is give you a certificate. When we were falling asleep in the minefields... ...this is what I used to do to keep awake... I'll be watching recede into the distance... ...where there'll be someone else ...receding from you! LONG LIVE! - What is it? - Terminus! Can you spare a moment, sir? I have... four minutes. That's enough. There should be a wall... My execution... If you can't see, why have a watch? Only two and half minutes! That's all you can spare for us... ...who were ready to suffer execution for you. Now, I've a better chance with you than a blind man. Perhaps it's better that I'm alive, can see, can... Colleagues! ...romantic impulses still manifest themselves! She was late and now wants to run him down! He may be here! What's his surname? I don't know! His name? His first name? What year is he in? Which faculty? Surely you know his college? Which seat? Then I don't know. He had a sabre! Get up, or you'll catch cold!
