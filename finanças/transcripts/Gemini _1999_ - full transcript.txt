Sedic international inc., presents in association with kaiju theater a shinya tsukamoto film masahiro motoki ryo - Is it my turn now? - I'm next. The doctor's famous for treating that general, but in fact he saved a lot of badly wounded soldiers. Doctor, were you at the front-line in hoten too? Yes. With the third army. The third... army... Remarkable! And awarded a medal too. I was just an army doctor. Many saw far more terrible things than I did. This looks badly inflamed. What happened? He was attacked. By those brats from the slums. You just tried to give them some candy, didn't you? Think yourself lucky you were only hit. You could have caught a very nasty disease. I said it was nothing. Mother insisted we come so she could meet you. Has mother stopped saying those peculiar things? Do you recall anything today? What a horrible color! If only that fire had never happened... If only I could remember something. Don't worry about it. It's all in the past... Let it fade away. The most important thing is... That you're still here with us in a way, that fire brought us together. Despite their manner, they're really happy you're here. There's nothing that can't be explained away. And I'm always here for you. But that has to be our secret. Forever. Mother and father would faint if they knew how we first met by the river. If they ever found out that I saw you that time, stark naked. Rin, shige's come back. Shall we start preparing dinner? Yes. During my army service, I know I shouldn't say this, but for many badly wounded soldiers medical treatment seemed wasted I keep trying to suppress my thoughts, and dedicate myself to saving life again, but with the mortally ill, is it wrong of me to want to release them from pain? German medical ethics won you medals. You must keep treating a patient up to the very last moment. Yes. To be worthy of the title doctor, just promise you'll never again make decisions on human life. That's god's prerogative. Shige, shige! Yes! More rice, perhaps? A cloth, a cloth! Yes. - I'm sorry. - Don't worry. What's wrong? It's nothing. What is it? Nothing at all. - What? - Please don't laugh, but... Recently, this house has started to make my skin crawl. What do you mean? Well... how can I explain it? Nostalgia... Sadness... A shadowy figure... Sometimes our eyes meet... I can't really explain. What sort of nonsense is this? Think of your mother's health. This is hardly the right time for such morbid thoughts. It still hasn't gone. What is that horrible stench? Rin, what is it? Can't you do something about it? Alright. It seems to be coming from the back, not the front. In that case, why didn't you do something earlier? - Can you smell it in the surgery? - A little. Yukio! Don't come in the house in your surgery coat! Father? .. Father? Epidemic containment do not touch Not yet... About the inheritance... It's not all finished yet. After I'm gone... There will be problems... Yukio... - You have to be strong. - Mother, don't say such things. One more thing - yes? Are you sure she's the right one for you...? Haven't we discussed this a hundred times? We only got married after you gave your approval. However you think about it, it's strange. She has no memory! There's no way of knowing her family background... Mother, you always said... You can judge a person by their clothes. You should feel sorry for her, mother. Amnesia is a terrible thing. She lost her family and home in that dreadful fire. But yes? Ever since she came, the house has felt strange. - Mother! - Well, hasn't it? Your father met a gruesome end. Yukio... Yes? Stay with me a little longer. Of course, of course. My son... I'm afraid... terribly afraid. What are you doing, drinking at this hour? Yukio, it's really wonderful. You worked so hard to earn those medals. I'm so very happy. Well done, well done... Forgive me. I'm so happy to be able to breathe easily again. Yukio, I'm sorry for saying those things earlier. I was a little disturbed from the shock. Rin, forgive me. I'm alright now. Don't worry. Go back to your own room now. Tonight we'll stay here with you. Now, just relax and go back to sleep. Is everything all right? What is it? Everything's fine. I'm just going to the bathroom. - Shall I go with you? - No! No! No! No! Well... good night then. Everything's fine. Good night. Yukio-San, what are all those people doing in the house? Her heart was weak too. She followed her husband to the grave. There's things we must all discuss so soon after her husband's death? I think we should keep the funeral very private, yes? Have you remembered something? We've checked the rooms. There's nothing suspicious. Ah, so you're the famous Dr. daitokuji are you? Just because you've got a few medals, don't let it go to your head, you arrogant bastard. Doctorl! Doctor! Doctor! Takie! Toshiko! Suzu! Are you still here? Anyone still around? A plague victim. Inform the police, and the quarantine station at once. Doctor! Doctor! Help me! Epidemic containment get the protective clothes. Doctor! Open up! Doctor! ...Doctor! Quick! What is it? It's the mayor...! He's had too much to drink. He fell down... He fell on a stake! Doctor! Doctor! Help us! Doctor! Toshiko, suzu, move them as far away as possible, and try not to touch the child. Takie-San. In here. This way. Yukio! What about the mother and child? Hold his legs and arms down, please. I'll anesthetize him. It's all right. Compared to the battlefield, this is easy. Yukio! Doctor! - What about the mother and child? - Please go, you shouldn't see this. Scalpel. I'm sorry. It's just... that mother and child, she'd heard the rumor about you too. And believed it... Totally... You must know how terrible the plague can be. And where do you think they are from? From the slums! The slums are breeding grounds of infection. And it's not just disease. Robberies and many other crimes. Just the other day I treated a child who'd been struck by a brat from the slums. Maybe... He said something hurtful to the slum children? There must have been a reason. That's not true. They're just like that, those people... from birth. That's what father would have said... Instead of your house, the fire should have taken the slums, the whole place should be razed to the ground. Strike at the very root of the problem. That would be the end of all our troubles. And you? What do you think, yukio? Is that really what you think? I don't want to think that way. But it can't be helped, can it? It's not easy to protect a person from evil. So you're saying the slum people aren't even human? You're saying they're evil? And if they're not evil, they're just nobody? What's wrong with you? Why are you so argumentative? What's come over you? You're not a nobody because I validate your existence. You don't even know who you are! Doctor? You're still here? There's no consulting this afternoon. Yes. There was a call from the university hospital. The mayor is making an excellent recovery. He's back to his old self, as soon as his stomach is recovered, he'd like to come and pay his respects. Personally, I think you made the right choice that night. Where the hell is rin? Rin? Ah, you're awake, master. I'll get breakfast ready for you at once. Good morning. Thank you. Temporarily closed what is it? I've decided to close the surgery for a while. The slum family may have left their germs around. Someone might fall sick because of it, and we can't have that. Don't worry. Think of it as a short holiday. It's been so hectic lately. Who are you? Who are you? I am you. I know everything about you. Your habits, your tastes, everything. So you're the one who's been spying on me. I didn't have the desire to watch you in bed though. Don't you lay a hand on my wife. Do that and I'll kill you good. But tell me, how do you plan to get out and kill me? I never thought I'd hear such barbarous words from you. You! You're the one who killed my parents... aren't you! Maybe. Why didn't I think to check that? Rin... rin. Rin, forgive me. That time, everything happened so fast, I couldn't explain properly. Maybe the mayor's wound reminded me of the front-line but I suddenly felt so tired... I think I was looking for your approval. I acted like a spoilt child. Your words brought out the tyrant in me. I knew you were troubled too, yukio. And yet I replied by shouting at you like that. I acted so badly. My wife... Did you make advances to my wife? Did rin accept you? What...? What have I ever done to you? I've tried to make people happy, I can't remember anything that would inspire hatred. So, what shall we do about the daitokuji surgery? Maybe I'll give your patients injections of my piss. Help! Help! Open the cover! Hey! Anybody! Rin! Rin! Shige! Hey! Anybody! Rin! Rin! Shige! Shige! Are you there, shige? What's the matter? Can't you eat? In that case, I'll treat you to a delicious tale. Want to hear it? Want to hear it? Or not? Well, never mind. Do you want to hear it? Speak up. You want to hear the story or not? I want to hear it... Really? Good, in that case, I'll tell it to you. Pay attention. It's about your greatest anxiety right now. Who am I? That's of no consequence. No. It's about rin. She's one of those people you despise the most. A woman from the slums. Rin is a beggar woman. You think I'm lying. You want to believe I'm lying. I'm afraid it's the indisputable truth. And most important of all, in the slums, rin was my woman. That burn Mark on rin's leg? It wasn't caused by the fire. Yukio, she doesn't suffer from amnesia either. No such thing. Can't you see that? What on earth have you been thinking about rin? What do you think you know about her? I just meant a vow, a sign of our love, not this... Not marking each other with the same scar. Just a pledge with our little fingers. Stop fooling around, for god's sake! Stop it! What's the matter? Quickly, come in. That's a nice hair clip. I gave one just like it to my fianc√©e. She's dead now though. It's a terrible world. Because people like you exist. Someone who'd kill a man's wife and family. And then give his thievings to his woman. Thank you, god. At last I've found him. - Leave me! - Sutekichi! Imbecile! No matter how bad things got, I never taught you to do that. Thief! Murderer! Who picked the thief's purse in the middle of the night? You bastard! Why do you only act like my father when you upbraid me? What? The truth is, sutekichi, you are not... You're not my son. A baby came floating down the river. When I saw it was still breathing, I picked it up. A performer's life is about arousing sympathy. A child with a nasty birthmark like you was a godsend. Now you repay my kindness with evil. Never show your face here again! Go on! Get him out of my sight! I'm sorry... I'm sorry... - Sutekichi! - Rin! Rin! Don't move! Rin! You'll only be with that bastard for a little while! I'll come back for you. Wait for me rin! ...Rin! You've come back for me. Sutekichi... What are you talking about, rin? Were you dreaming, rin? What? Once... when I was a child... I had a dream... My younger brother would come to see me... Really? Your brother? That means your memory is slowly coming back. Yes... ltis... Rin, a woman from the slums... That's funny... My head... help... help! Somebody... help me! What is it, rin? Yukio... Recently, you really seem to want me. Before, when you embraced me, it was all over in an instant. What's come over you? I really can't fathom why you've become so strange. Was spying on us in bed so unbearable? Huh, sweet sutekichi. Really... Well. I suppose it would be... Are you angry with me? Even after you promised you'd come back for me, I went and hooked up with another man. But I was betrayed by circumstances, that's all. Everybody works so hard. You can't expect to get money for nothing. Someone like you, must be used to rape every day. I'll pay you to stay with me. Little slut. I have... Certain unusual tastes. It's not my fault... He was wicked... He was... He was wicked... Sutekichi... Come back soon... Sutekichi! I was so embarrassed, I ran away. I really thought you'd come back... Don't ask me to forgive you... Berate me instead. Scold me as much as you like, please, scold me. It's tragic. You've lost your memory, and become obsessed with this silly story. What is your connection to this family? Are you and he accomplices in some game? Are you both playing with me? If not, then tell me where the other one's gone? It doesn't matter how long you go on pretending, it's over as soon as I see this. Every day I get on better with your woman. Since she's getting on so well with me, will you give up on her? I mean, she's a slum woman. By the way, our game's over. I won't be bringing you any more food. Savor your last mouthful. A wonderful sight. Yes, a wonderful sight... Sutekichi, today in town, I saw a fellow... Who looked exactly like you. Like a pea from the same pod. It took my breath away. Sutekichi, truth is you're not really my son. A baby came floating down the river. When I saw it was still breathing, I picked it up for a lark. How are you? Do you get it yet? Your father and mother murdered me! My father... my father was a doctor... He saved lives... They'd never do any such thing. But they did. Your father and mother murdered me. Because of this ugly birthmark. I was... murdered. To keep the nasty truth hidden. Now, listen well. This filthy murderer's blood flows in you too! Father... mother... me too... We could never kill anything... Lies! You're all murderers. Killers! Filthy murdering bastards! Why do you think I came back to this town? For rin, of course. Yesterday's enemy is today's friend. The battle's over, the war's at an end. Kill me... please... We praise their martial skills. They praise our courageous hearts. Kill me... please... What shall I do? Kill you? Or not kill you? You decide. With fond farewells and salutes, we part, wheeling right and left. A killer... A killer... After all I did to help, a killer... Daitokuii... Yukio. So... Do you intend to carry on this imposture even when we sleep? That's it. I was betrayed after all, by you. No matter how long I waited, you never came, did you? However long I wait, sutekichi will never return... Sutekichi probably died somewhere, and his soul took over yukio's body to come and meet me. From the ruins of that fire, I decided to start a new life. It's all because you never came back for me. That man, yukio, he told me, he loved me, he was gentle with me. Much more gentle than you ever were. Just when I was about to be loved, you bastard, you ruined it! You're too cruel! Stop it, please. I beg you. I'll do anything, anything you want, if we could only go back to the way we were. The happy relationship we had. Why are you acting so hysterically? From now on, let's try and heal your sickness, the two of us, together. Brother... Sutekichi is dead... And his soul has taken over yukio, his identical twin... He's come back to judge me for my sins... Rin! .. Rin! Come on, push, that's it, come on now. I'm off on my rounds. Take care. Madam, I'm back. I've done the shopping. Oh, there you are. Thank you. You can start preparing the meal. Oh, it's the golden medal boy. Been a long time. So, how are you... You arrogant bastard? Good day.
