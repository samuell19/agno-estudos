Dolly's my patron saint. - Of what? Inches? - Trailblazers. - ...see Dolly live at the Bicentennial Hall... - She's coming here? - She's doing a show in Minneapolis. - [Liz and Belle]: "Minnecrapolis." Jinx!

She's doing a concert in Minneapolis. - "Annabelle and I", and of course not; you're too young to go to concerts, never mind the States. - I'm practically 12. - Which makes you still 11. Use your napkin, please. - But it's Dolly Parton. It's the closest she'll be. - Minneapolis is hours away. Remember when we went last summer? - [Man]: Hello! - Hi, honey! Supper's on the table. - Maybe Dad could drive us. - Elizabeth, I'm sorry. The answer is no. - Something tells me that's not your handiwork, kiddo. - It's a Mom original. - What? It's a tough cut. - How was your day, hon? - Good. - Pick out wallpaper yet? - Not exactly. - Just pick out a pattern. I don't care what it is. Let's get started. - Mom, did Grandma Dahler have big boobs? - Your grandmother had a perfectly normal bust. - It's such a few dishes, it's silly to put them in that big machine. - But that's what the machine is for. - Hmm. So what's this for? [She laughs] Mmm. I still have to help Elizabeth with her assignment. - No, you don't. I just poked my head in to say goodnight.

It's hard to believe you're almost 12. - Yeah, but it still seems like forever. - Well, to me, it seems like yesterday. I remember it was the middle of the night. A very still and warm night. And I woke up, like I'd been struck by lightning. At first, I was sure it was the creamed corn... - Mom, what are you doing? You're supposed to save this for my birthday. - I know. Oh, we can make an exception this once, right? Turns out, it wasn't the corn after all; it was you. You were finally coming. When I woke your poor dad, he got so nervous, he put his pants on over his pajamas to drive me to the hospital. And then, when we finally got out to the car, he'd forgot his keys. And when he ran back to the house to get them, he'd locked us out. Mmm, that's my girl.

Tell me, Miss Gray, what have you got written down there for your mother's blood type? - Uh, double A. [Class giggles] I mean, um, A. Just A. - And your father's? - AB. - Elizabeth's father is type AB. Her mother is A. So when they make a baby... [Class giggles] When they make a baby, the combination of their two blood types will give that baby a possible three blood types: A, B, or AB. [Teacher's voice becomes quiet] Understand? Which one do you have, Elizabeth? [Marion gasps] - You scared the living daylights out of me. Elizabeth? So that's what you're up to. Elizabeth Allison Gray, a four-year-old knows better than to cut up perfectly good clothes. Do you think money grows on trees? [Marion's voice becomes quiet] Do you? Now, I want you to go upstairs and think long and hard about how you are going to replace this bathing suit. Don't give me that look, young lady. You think you're old enough to wear a bra? You're old enough to pay for your mistakes. Go. I... just don't understand where this behaviour is coming from all of a sudden. - Well, Mar, couldn't it be just that she's growing up? I mean, that's what happens, right? Thing start changing. Actually, I've been thinking that maybe it's time we should start talking about a few things that we-- [Radio news playing] - They're really media events because this government has shown itself to be totally immune to public opinion and these pressure groups. And when the minister is found, the human resources minister tells the delegates of women that women make great-- [Radio clicks off] [She sighs] - Guess you were hungry after all. - No... - Not even for Mom's meatloaf? - She's not my mom. - Elizabeth. - I'm adopted, aren't I? I'm adopted? How come you never told me? How come? - Marion... - No! It's a mistake. - Mistake? - Marion, don't. Please. - Phil, tell her it's a mistake. It has to be. Where are you getting this from, Elizabeth? I don't understand. - From the chart in class with our blood types. - How would you even get that information? - Marion, I told her. - So... ...is it a mistake? - Phil? - No, Elizabeth, there's no mistake. She asked me. For her homework last night, and... ...at first I... But then, I thought, "Okay, well, if she's ready, then this is a chance for her to figure it out." - She's a little girl, Phil. She doesn't know what she's ready for. That's our job. We're supposed to protect her, and we said we agreed. - I know... - [Marion]: We agreed. - [Phil]: ...but this is going to be much better for everybody. Believe me! - [Marion]: It's not about everybody, Phil; it's about Elizabeth! [Telephone rings] Hello? Oh, I'm sorry. I meant to call. Um, she's not feeling very well, so I'll be keeping her home from school today. No, homework won't be necessary. I'm sure she'll be herself by tomorrow. Thank you. Elizabeth?

I need to-- - Get a life? - Shut up, Shelley. - I can't talk right now, okay? So, are you sure you can't tell? - It's good. - Don't worry about it. - Yeah? - Oh, my God. Did you... get it? - Last night. - Last... But why didn't you tell me? - I did. Well, I called your house, but your mom said it wasn't a good time, so... - Oh. - So, anyway, what'd you want to say to me? - It's pretty personal. - It's okay. I mean, we're blood sisters now. - [Shelley]: Wow, so, you're like an actual bastard. - [Belle]: She's not a bastard. A bastard is someone who doesn't have a dad. - [Shelley]: Well, then, if you don't have a mom or a dad, doesn't that just make you a double bastard? - No. It actually makes you an orphan. But Libs has parents. - [Shelley]: If she's adopted, they're not her real parents. [Girl's voice becomes quiet] - No shit. I'd literally kill for my parents not to... [Magpie chirps] [Chirping] [Door opens] - Elizabeth, where have you been? Annabelle brought your things. Honey, your boots. - Do you know... ...who my real parents are? - Elizabeth, please don't. - Who are they? - I don't know. Elizabeth, what are you doing? - I'm looking for something that says who they are. - We didn't hide anything. We don't have that kind of information. We weren't allowed to, honey. No one is. - When a child is born in the province, the birth mother completes a registration of birth. When that child is adopted, the original registration of birth is removed from the general records and sealed in a vault. - They're in a vault? Where? How do you get them out? - Um... No one may apply for the original birth record once the child has been placed for adoption. The only birth record available is the one showing the adoptive information. Therefore, persons who have been adopted and those who have placed their child for adoption are not considered related. [Crowd noises on TV] - Please turn off the TV.

Just a warning: Dolly's using her usual colourful language. - [Dolly]: Well, Ted, I've always said, I've always had more nerve than I've got talent, but I don't care who you are or what you are if you've got something to offer as a human being. I've just never been one of those people to judge and criticize other people for whatever they're doing. I don't care if a person's black or white or both. I don't care if they're gay or straight, bisexual, whatever. I say, whatever you are, be that, and be good at it. - [Announcer]: That was the one and only Dolly Parton, giving our morning man words to live by. [Country music] - There's more to her than meets the eye, isn't there? - She's a trailblazer. - She sounds very real. ♪♪♪ What's wrong? - My back hurts. - Whereabouts? Ooooh.

Be the 13th caller, and you can win yourself tickets to see Dolly Parton live. - Oh... all right. Oh... Hmm... ["I Will Always Love You" playing on radio] Okay, uh... Flag 'em down. Excuse me? I'm sorry, uh, can you tell me if there's any way around this? We're trying to get to the Bicentennial Hall. - Take a right in the alley up ahead, and come up behind the hall. Can't miss it. - Okay.

Okay, I only have a 20 and some change. - I have a ten dollar bill. - Well, 20 more bucks, you got yourself a ticket. - That's robbery. - It's a sold-out show, lady. - Listen, this is all the money we have, so isn't there some way you can at least let my daughter in for 30 dollars? Hey! We've come a long way. - A really long way. Just for this show. Just... for a chance to meet my mom. - Say what? What do you mean, meet your mom? Who's this? - [Liz]: It's... complicated. - So then who are you trying to meet? - Dolly Parton. - This I gotta hear. Okay, kid, I'll tell you what.

I know what you meant. - Headliner's about to go, ladies. - Go. [Audience noise in the distance] [Audience chanting "Dolly!"] [Audience buzzing] [Audience sounds become distant and muted] - [Announcer]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, Minneapolis, Minnesota, please welcome country music superstar, Miss Dolly... ...Parton! [Elizabeth panting] - Mom!! - [Dolly]: My dearest Ruby, your letter touched me so much, I just had to sit down and write you back as soon as I could. Sometimes, life puts big ol' hurdles in our way just to show us what we're made of-- all the good stuff we have inside we might not find otherwise. Well, I'd say you've already discovered some mighty fine stuff, and I can just tell, you're not done yet-- not by a long shot. And I would hope that if I ever did have a daughter, she'd turn out to be just like you. But, honey, to the best of my knowledge, I have never had a child, so I'm afraid I can't be the mother you're looking for, and I am truly sorry if this news adds any more to your heartache. [Magpie chirps] I can't imagine how awful it must be for you not to be able to find out who you're from. All I can tell you is, whenever I've wanted something real bad, I find it helps to make as much danged noise about it as possible. ♪♪♪ [Audience clapping and cheering] - My name is Elizabeth Allison Gray. But, for a while, it was actually Ruby. And, probably, a long time ago, it was something else that I don't even know about. Well, at least not yet.
