- ♪ MTV ♪ - We wish you... A merry Chri... Oh! - Merry Christmas! Happy holidays to all of you, welcome! We are doing our annual house party vibe today, okay guys? Where we bring our favorite stars from their house to ours, let's get this party started, come on! Oh, we love him, we know him from his movies, we have... - Oh, so you just not gonna wait? Give it up, everybody, for Ludacris! - Happy holidays, brother, good to see you. - Great to see you, too. - So, how are you and the family spending this holiday season? - Man, myself and the family, you know, I have all girls in this household, and this year, they saying they want snow, but now I have to figure out where there's guaranteed snow for the holidays for all of my girls. - Well bro, I hear the North Pole is pretty good for that. Before you go, we love your movies and your music, and you're this fantastic entrepreneur, but obviously it wasn't always like that for you. Were there ever any hard times for you, growing up, especially during the holiday season? - There were a lot of times where it was a challenge. You know, so many memories of having to sacrifice, and even me being around nine years old one Christmas, and not getting anything for Christmas. You have to realize how fortunate you are, just to get a gift on the holidays, so that's why I've dedicated my life to giving back, and you know, if anybody's listening, if you're going through something hard, make sure you understand that it's only building your character to be the best possible you that you can be. - Thank you, thank you for sharing, thank you for sharing. - Great show, Parker. - Thanks, girl! - Yes, Parker, that was a great show, as per usual. Girl, you really know how to take a deep dive into somebody's life. - Well you, my friend, know how to deep dive into style. - Well, it takes one to know one. You look fabulous. - Thank you, honey, but I cannot wait until tomorrow. The deep dive that I'm doing with Kurt and Goldie and Kate about their holiday family... What's that face? - Uh, yeah, so about... - Taylor, thank you. I will handle this. - Handle what? - Tomorrow's guest has been changed. - No. - Yup. - You know that I don't do last minute. - I know. - You know that I don't have time for homework, 'cause you know I have 350 stockings that I still have to fill for the charity... - I know. - You're the EVP of unscripted for this fabulous network, so use all your clout, and get me my guest that was booked. - I would love to, but this comes straight from Judy upstairs, so my hands are tied. - Who is it? - Finn Holt. - Finn Holt? - Right? - No. - Yes! - No! - We have known for months that The Finn Holt Show was coming to this network. You did the deal! No, Monty his audience is huge. I don't have time to prepare for him! - I get that, but he just wrapped his North American season, so we are so lucky to have grabbed him before he flies off to who knows where. The timing is so right. - Not for me. - Come on, Parker. - You come on! - You are a natural at reading people, so come on, let's run with it! - You run up outta here. - This is gonna be so fun. Once we reach the bottom, the only way we can get to our extraction point is by getting to the other side of this pond... Knock knock, honey. Hey you two! Hi. Hi Daddy. Hello. Cop a squat, family. What you got there, dad? - Oh, some mac and cheese for you. - Thank you, Daddy. - Yo, sis, I can't believe you got Finn Holt on your show tomorrow! - Yeah, me either. - Hey sis, you think you could hook me up and get me on his show? - Well, I would love to baby bro, but he only takes celebrities on his adventures or excursions or whatever. - Okay, but you a celebrity, right? - And I'm your brother. - Hm, I see you, I see you, but when they do celebrity sibling's edition, I'ma tell them, "Holler at my brother, Darren." - Oh, okay. - 'Cause you famous in your mind. - You're right, you being petty, I see you, okay, okay. It's the truth man, I'm telling you. Okay, okay, it sure sounds like this Finn is something else. - Dad, exactly, and that's what I'm trying to figure out, what that something is. - Look, just have fun tomorrow. And eat. - Yes, Daddy. Guys, I was up til four this morning doing research on this man. He got the Cousteau Award for his marine expeditions, the Henson Award for his Arctic exploration, but I can't find anything on Finn Holt, the man, outside of the wild that I can really dig into. - Well, why don't you just look at his Instagram? - His show has one, but he doesn't. - What? He doesn't have any personal social media? - Mm-mm. - Okay, that's weird. - I was working on some... Here we go. Yeah. Baby girl, can you make sure that this gets on the screen for me, please? - Of course, Parker. - Thank you so much. - I'll just have to draw the rest out of him, and let's leave these on a little while longer, please. - The real question. What lip are we thinking today? Red! - Scientist, UK-born, Caribbean... Hey, did we queue up that photo? Alright, cool. - Check your teeth, Parker. - Did she even make it to hair and makeup? - I got this. - Well no, that's fine, as long as he's here. I'm sorry, he's doing what? - Lion's beautiful, you got it. - Yeah! Merry Christmas, happy holidays to all of you. Now, our guest today maybe could use a little can of bear spray in his stocking. - He's a scientist, adventurer, he eats insects and snakes, he has spent a month in a jungle eating nothing but wild berries. Someone get this man a ham sammich and a warm welcome, to Mr. Finn Holt! - Vince, give her a sign. A signal. Something. Here we go. Hey, everyone. Hey. Are you alright? - Uh... - Okay, good. - Finn Holt, everybody. - Okay. - Well, that was uh, quite the entrance. - Usually my getaways are more dramatic, so I thought why not change it up? - Why not? - Right? So, the cuisine in the wild, is snakes your favorite delicacy? - Actually, that would have to be Ngau pín. Bull testicles. Yeah, in Vietnam they're believed to increase a man's sexual ability, so I ate them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. - Easy now, my daddy's watching. - Whoa. Hiya, dad. - Well, speaking of family, Finn's mother is the acclaimed archaeologist, Dr. Constance Holt. She's quite the rock star. - Yeah, she's really something. - Judging from this photo here, I would have to agree. - Oh... - Clearly adventure is in your DNA? - Oh, absolutely. - Still, you must be afraid, out there in the wild. You don't know what to expect. - It can be daunting, yes. - So, why do you do it? Why do you put yourself in danger, in front of millions of people? - I don't think my life's any more dangerous than yours, really. I mean, anyone's world can change at the blink of an eye, and you're forced to adapt. - Yes. Many of the celebrity guests you've had on your show have shared with me they overcame some real obstacles out there in the wild with you, and not just, you know, the bears and the snakes, but they've said that the experience was a deep, personal game changer. - Well, that's the goal. See, every person that comes on my show has something that they need to conquer. - Survival therapy? - Ah, yeah, that's one way of looking at it. Yeah, exactly. - Mm-hmm, well, you know for some people, survival is getting through the holidays with family. - Speaking of family, what is your favorite part about the holidays? Hm? Spending time with your mom? With your dad? - Gifts, actually, yeah. I love surprising people with gifts. - Really? - Yeah. In fact, I have one for you. - Is that right? - Where's my producer? Gary? Ah, there he is. - I have no idea. - Oh, well hi, okay, well uh, Merry Christmas to me! - Go ahead. As you can hear, this one can't wait. - I see. Oh, okay... Uh, oh, hi! Oh. - Is that a monkey? - I gotcha. Thought I'd give you a little taste of the wild and unexpected we experience on the show. - Well, um, thank you, but I don't think my neighbors would appreciate me, um, having a giant, um, squirrel, what's that? - It's called a ferret, yeah, they're part of the weasel family. - Well, I have known some ferrets in my life. - Well okay, thank you... - You wanna hold him? - No, I'm so, so good. Thank you. - That was a complete disaster. - Actually Park, I think it was kinda fun. - Fun? That was a total clusteryuck if I ever saw one. Where is Monty? - Um, I think he's upstairs talking to Judy. - I gotta get some air. I think that went pretty well! I think so. - Hey, how's the footage from the rapids coming? - Episode 13 is still uploading. - Nice. - Hey, do you think the network will give us, you know, one of those fancy dressing rooms? You know, with the big, old couches, the juice box, those little bowls of candy canes? - Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, time out. What you saying, you gonna give up on Connie here? This girl's come a long way since we were just punks posting on YouTube. - Don't worry Connie, you will always be our hot studio on wheels. - Yes, you will. Maybe just, you know, a little bowl of candy canes? - Done. - Yes! Hello, Gary speaking. Oh no, no, we're still here. Really? Well, that doesn't really give us very much time. Okay. Mate, our next few days could get pretty interesting. - Let me get this straight, you want Parker Baldwin to be on my show? - Yes. Judy from upstairs sees a real spark between you two. - I don't know about that. - Oh, Parker will love this idea. Pretty sure. Judy seems to think that this is gonna be a huge holiday special event. - Really? - Really. - Well, we've never really done a holiday special before. - No, you haven't. - Hey, I love a new challenge. - There you go! - Okay, well, I'll let the team know that we're officially in preproduction. - Go team, go! - Oh. - Hey. - Hey there. - Uh, listen, um, I'm sorry about the interview. I wasn't prepared. - Oh, relax, it was great. Really. Plus, sometimes life throws you a curveball or two, right? - I'm more of a basketball chick myself. But yeah, and we'll do it again soon. Maybe next time without a furry friend. - Well, I can't guarantee we won't run into any when we're out in the wild. - What do you mean when we're out in the wild? - Well, when you come on my show. - Oh no, no see, I'm never gonna be on your show. No, no, no shame, just me? I'm... nah. - Really? 'Cause the big boss upstairs says otherwise. In fact, we're leaving in almost 48 hours. - I'm sorry, what? - Parker! Parker! I need to talk to you. - About me doing his show? - Yes! I guess the cat is out of the bag! That's twice today though, right? - That wasn't a cat. - No, it wasn't, but how funny was that? I mean, everyone loved it, especially Judy, who wants you appearance on his show to be a holiday special event premiering on Christmas. It's gonna be a ratings bonanza! - No. - Yeah. - No. - Why? - We don't have time to prepare for anything like that. - No worries, I'm always ready for an adventure. - What about my live Christmas Eve show? - Oh good news, we want you both on that show, together. So you'll be back in plenty of time. - Back? Back from... - I can't tell you. - He can't tell you! - I never tell guests where we're going, because I don't want them to prepare. Oh, wow, that's really gonna be something. I mean, to see Parker Baldwin raw and getting stripped down by Finn Holt... Geez, that didn't come out right. I'm gonna work on that, but it's gonna be fun! - I'm gonna talk to Judy, this is not happening. - This will be fun. This is not happening. This is so happening. Judy says I have one more special to fulfill on my contract for the year, and this has to be it. Honey, you'll be okay. - Oh, I know I will be, because I am going to spend the next 48 hours preparing for anything and everything. I love you, talk to you later. All done shopping, now for research and packing. - You're right, room service here is great. Now listen, this Judy wants a Christmas special. Nothing says holiday adventure more than the far north. - Yeah, I don't disagree, mate, except we're not gonna have enough time to transport Connie there. I'll barely have enough time to cut and upload the episode when we get back. - I know we're pressed, but we'll make it. Now, I'm thinking we'll start at the base of the mountain here. Since Parker's at the top of her game, professionally, let's hike her to the top of this peak, to elevate her trust in the unknown. - You sure? The terrain up there, that is gonna make it very hard for a chopper to manage extraction. - I'm well aware. - You know, all of our celebrity guests, they've always actually wanted to go on an adventure. But this one... - Is terrified to let herself go, yeah. I got that. Which is why I have her packing clamps and plenty of rope. - Oh, I know that look. Alright. It is my pleasure to present the Young Exploration Award to Finn Holt! He has created some of the most iconic TV shows, Norman Lear is here! - Now, this is not on your list, but I'm packing antibacterial ointment. What wisdom can you drop on us? - Living in the moment. At 99, it took me every split second of those years to get to talk to you today. That's all they're letting you bring? - I know, right? Remember the list that I showed you from them? Yeah, so everything on that list is in that pack. And a few things that's not on the list that I was like, "I'ma need this." - Good for you. You know, your mother would have loved this. That woman always flew by the seat of her pants. - Yeah. - That's how we ended up here... - With the restaurant. - Yeah. So, who knows what will come of this adventure? - That's it exactly, Daddy. Who knows? I don't know. - Honey, you're the only child I know that had a seating plan for their birthday party. Who knows what would happen if you let somebody you didn't expect sit down next to you? You know, 'cause if you're always trying to steer the ship, you may miss out on something, or someone, really special. Hey, I want you to take this. - No, no, Daddy, this is your lucky hat. No. - You have it, baby. - Are you... - Yes, yes. I think you could use it. - Thank you. - You're an explorer, too. You just explore people, not places. Now come on, the car's gonna be here any minute. - Yes, sir. Thank you, Daddy. - Alright, baby. - Hello mates, and welcome to the far north for a special holiday edition of Finn Holt Adventures. I'm on my way to meet the incomparable talk show host, Parker Baldwin, who's on a plane right now with no idea where she's landing. What lessons do I want Parker to learn over the next 72 hours in the wild? One, there are some things you can't prepare for, and two, don't fear the unknown. Come on. Let's go on an adventure. - Thanks, Kat. Hello! Gary, right? - Guilty. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Nice to see you again. - Nice to see you again. - Can I take your pack? - Thanks. And I met Kat, your medic and cameraperson. Thanks for all the cool gear. I got a nice little utility belt going on here. It's to hang my coffee, right? We rolling? - Oh, you are always rolling. Just, yeah, right there. - Right, bodycam. Oh, and uh, this guy, yeah? Okay, here we go. Hi everybody, welcome to my Finn Holt adventure. I don't know where we are, and you know that is very unusual for me. - Does she know that she's not on a talk show? - I can tell you it is cold, and there is no sign of civilization. How about we meet our host? Your host and mine, Finn Holt. And cut. - Alright. - Nice. - Alright, let's go. - Alright, hop in. - Alright, just a heads up, we don't have a place to land the helicopter, so we're gonna hover as low as we can and rappel. - I'm sorry, what? - I'm gonna get the door here, just watch yourself. - Wait, what? - There we are. Alright, don't worry, you're anchored in real tight, alright? You see here? You're not going anywhere. Don't worry. So, what I want you to do now is I want you to put your left foot down on the skiff with the rails. Take your time. Just gotta move your body down. - Where's the rail? - Trust me, it's there. - I'm five feet tall, I can't feel it! - Oh, you'll find it. - My legs are short. Wait a minute, I got it. - You got it? Alright. I don't know what configuration you got yourself in. - Welcome to the adventure, this is just the beginning. Alright, now put this hand in your back there. Perfect. That's your brake. Okay, I've got you here, now this rope, if you let go of the chair and hold onto this rope and just lean back. I want you to flex your knees and then push away. - When you let it out, you'll slowly descend to the ground. Lean back. Nice and easy. There you are, you're a natural! And away she goes. How about that? - There you go. - Perfect. You alright? - Yeah, I'm, I'm good, I'm good. You know, you could've told me I was gonna be jumping out of a chopper. - I gave you a heads up. - You did not! A proper heads up would've been to give me some time so I could prepare. - Prepare, right, right. - Alright! Over the next 72 hours, we're gonna be climbing. And as we get higher, it will get colder, and the terrain will get rougher. Wait a minute, hold on! I lost my Daddy's hat. My Daddy's lucky hat, we gotta go back. - Do you have another? - No, it's his lucky hat. - That is a problem. You're gonna need one out here. - It's a problem because it's my Daddy's lucky hat. - Well clearly it brought you luck. You rappelled, first time. And you're in one piece. - It's my Daddy's lucky hat! I wouldn't even worn a hat if I had known that I was gonna be jumping out of a chopper! - I tell you what, you can wear mine. I brought a spare. - It's sentimental, it's got sentimental value, - and he... - There you go. - Perfect. - Oh, and check this out. Hm? - Festive. - Isn't it? - Great. Now come on. Let's hurry up and make shelter. Yeah, we'll set up shelter here. Being exposed to the cold for too long can cause fatigue, you become passive. You lose your will to survive, so we should get building our shelters - while we still have energy. - Let's do it. Aw yeah, come through! Woo! Voila, folks, what do you think? - It's not bad. Not bad at all. - That's right it ain't bad, gave a little New York swag to it. - Yeah, but uh, why's there a tree on the inside? - Because it's Christmas, and that is my Christmas tree. - Nice. - That you over there? - Yup, that's me over there. What do you think? - Too bad you don't have a Christmas tree. - Right. So, should we go find some food? - Yes indeed, I thought you'd never ask. Lazy water, it runs from the top of the mountain all the way down. My parents used to take my brother and I fishing when we were little kids. Upstate New York. God, I haven't done this in ages. It started to become a bit of a family tradition. But, since this is your holiday special, what kind of family holiday traditions do you guys have? - Sometimes I'd go help my mom on a dig, but it's not really a tradition. What about your family? Hm? I heard you talk on your show about your father and brother, but not your mother. - I'm surprised you watch my show. - I did my research, just to get an idea of who I'm dealing with. - And who are you dealing with? - Parker Baldwin. Named after the legendary jazz musician, and incomparable writer. Baldwin's her middle name. Alright. - Oh! - Oh. You got something on your line. - I got something! - Nice. Oh, oh, oh, nice work! Oh, oh, oh, hey, hang on, hey! Hang on, hang on! Looks like we're gonna have a little bit more of a meal here. Oh my gosh! Oh, this is gonna be way better than berries and bark. - Indeed. Nice work. Now let's get these on a stringer. - Alright, that's your job I do believe. There you go. And then what? In the wild, don't you guys give thanks to nature and stuff? Hold on, I got to give thanks. Thank you, Glacia River, for the food! ♪ I caught a fish 'Cause I am bad ♪ Whoa, whoa, hey. Drop the fish! - Oh no. - Drop it. Drop the fish! Parker! Let it go! Parker! Parker! Parker, grab my hand! Here, reach out, I've got you. Come on, there you go. - Are you alright? - It's so cold, it's so cold. - Okay, okay. Let's get you dry by the fire. - I c-c-can't feel my face. You know, we were inseparable, the two of us. Now for the moment I'm going at Christmas, he was my little buddy, you know? I miss that gecko. - Thanks for sharing, Gary. You just can't help yourself, can you? - You know, if you dig deep and you talk about things that effect your heart, maybe it can help heal. - You know, you could do some digging yourself, Finn. - And you are lucky you didn't spend more time in that water today. - Don't I know it. Hold up. They are far away, right? They're not coming around here, right? - They shouldn't. I mean, most animals don't want anything to do with us anyway, really. - What do we do if we encounter an animal? - You make yourself fearless, like this. - She's right. You want to make yourself as big as possible, and make as much noise as you possibly can. And hopefully, they'll think better of messing with you. - Hopefully. - ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a happy New Year ♪ - ♪ So bring us some Figgy pudding ♪ ♪ So bring us some Figgy pudding ♪ ♪ So bring us some Figgy pudding ♪ ♪ And bring it right here ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a happy new year ♪ - Oh, alright! - Alright. She just brought the Met into the woods. Well, they're gone. Thanks for getting the gear by the river. Yeah. - You looking for Santa's sleigh? - Are we close to the North Pole? - You just gotta know, don't you? Why is that? - 'Cause I'm not a fan of not knowing. Even as a kid. I came up with this plan, that I was gonna catch Santa in action. I wanted to confirm that he had received my letter and had everything that I wished for in that sack of his. - And let me guess, you had this plan all mapped out, right? Like spreadsheets and charts and diagrams... - Of course. - And what was this plan? - I would go out onto the rooftop, and I would lay in wait. And I was gonna wait for Santa to land, but I was gonna corner him. - Hm. I tried this every year for three years, I never saw him. Not his sleigh, not the reindeer. - That must have been very disappointing. - Well, yeah. Thank you for sharing. - What? - I'll give you that, 'cause this is your show. Mm-hmm. - I look forward to lots more of that. I was mad at first, but Gary's hat is a life saver. - Yeah, he's helped me out a lot back in the day when we were just lads, getting into trouble. - Really? What kind of trouble? - Oh you know, the usual. Skydiving from the moors, snorkeling in the canal. - That is hardly the usual. And where'd all this take place? - Back home in the U.K. - Hm. Still home, huh? - Yeah, I've got a little place in Wolverton. - Ha! Little? This is Finn Holt of Holt's Castle. - It's about 100 miles from London. - Ah. - Yeah, it's where I like to land when I'm not out in the wild. - Sorry, that fish dinner didn't really fill the void. - It's alright, we can take a break. Have some fish skin jerky that I dried by the fire all night. - I am not ashamed to admit I would kill for some espresso right now. Ooh, or my dad's Christmas cookies. - Right? - Caramel latte. That's my go-to. - Shut up. No it is not. - Yeah, what? - I would not have guessed that, I thought for sure you were a grow and roast and grind your own coffee and then drink it black, black, black. - Well I am full of surprises. - Mm-hmm. - That's what makes me irresistible. - Oh, is that it? I thought it was your strong jaw line? - Well, besides the strong jaw line. What do you find irresistible? Or do you have too much self control for that? - There is nothing wrong with thinking before you leap, especially with relationships, right? I know what I want, what I need, in a partner. - Like? - Strength, support. Stability. Goals. - Have you found him yet? - I thought I had. Couple of times. - But never worked out as planned? - Oh, no. Your turn. What about you? - Me? I prefer to be on my own. It can get unpredictable out here, so that way I'm not responsible for anyone else. - You would choose out here over spending your life with someone? - If I get into trouble out here, I know how to deal with it. But if I lose someone out here, there's no way of healing from that. - What's that noise? - Could be elk, reindeer. - Reindeer? Aww. We need to get moving. - Reindeer! - They're so cute! - In the books they're cute, but out here, they'll take you out. - Wait a minute, what? What you mean, "take you out"? - Stay down. - Shouldn't we see what direction they're going in? - No, they'll be on top of us like a Mack truck on the freeway by the time you figure that out, come here. Sit. Yeah. Thought as much. Elk. Well, it's not exactly Santa's reindeer, but... it's pretty close. - Wow. - Your pants are still damp. - You're gonna have to buy me a drink before you just feel up on my leg like that. But yes, my pants are still damp. - Well, you do realize we've got another six miles to cover before we can make shelter? And it's just going to get colder the higher we climb. - Yeah. Okay. Come on, let's go. Since you just gonna feel up on people. I can't have you out here in wet gear, so we're gonna make a detour. I love it when we go off-book. You like history, Parker, so we're gonna check out the mountain's past. You know I like history. I don't believe it. Wow. Hello? Anyone here? All clear. - Alright. Oh, wow. Well, it's uh, it's no five-star, but I will take it. Wait, unless this is a cheat? 'Cause this is one girl that likes to play by the rules. - I get that. And it's not a cheat, it's out here, and it's part of the land. And most importantly, it'll help get you warm and dry. - I'm here for that. How old do you think this place is? - Based on this stove, I'd say at least 100 years. - Wow. Hey, do you think it still works? - There's just one way to find out. So, how about we go out, collect some wood, set up some snares, and catch something to cook on this thing? - Uh, snares? Like to catch small animals? - I don't exactly see us taking down a moose. - You don't know what all I can do. But how about this? I'll stay here, tidy up a bit. You go out there, do whatever you gotta do to get us some food. That's still me, I'm still working the lay of the land. - Alright, you can get out of trapping game today, but tomorrow... - Alright, alright, and don't you come back here without some viddles, you hear, honey? - Whatever you say, Peaches. - Okay, so I've got something special cooking up in here for him. Just to show him that he is not the only one that can be full of surprises. I'm gonna turn this off now, that way you can be just as surprised as he's gonna be. Ho ho ho. - I got Parker a little surprise here. Snares worked right off the hawk, so I got some nice meat for us. Gonna be a feast tonight, come on. We got game, we got game! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Welcome home! Please, no need to take off your shoes. What do you think? - Wow. - Pretty homey, huh? - Yeah, it sure is. - What's that um, that smell? It smells like um... - Christmas! - Yes. - That's because I'm simmering a little pine with my peppermint tea. - Wow. Well, in the spirit of the holidays, I come bearing gifts. Yes, some... - Nope. Mm-mm. I don't need to know what we'll be dining on this evening, but thank you darling. Just set it right there. Now, come on over and have a seat. - Oh, ladies first. Yeah, let me get that for you. - Thank you so much. - You are welcome. - Shall I pour you your usual? Whiskey neat? - How'd you guess? - I've been told that I'm a natural at reading people. And you are like, a tough weathered cowboy. Smooth and fiery. Like an aged scotch that warms you up. - Well, thank you. - Mm-hmm. - Here's to warming things up. Cheers. Now, that is good. - You really did a nice job in here. - Thank you. I try. - You know, when you asked me on the show about what my favorite part of Christmas is? - Mm-hmm. - Well, I steered it to that ferret because I didn't want to answer. I don't like to think about what I loved about the holidays. But tonight, all this, I mean... I can't help but think about the Christmases when my dad was alive. - I didn't know. - My mom and I, we don't talk about it. All the stories and interviews about me, they don't mention him. Maybe that's wrong, because they should. See my dad, he was a force. There was no mountain he couldn't, or wouldn't climb. No rapids he wouldn't ride. He was Superman. So I thought. One day when I was ten, we went on a hike, and um, Mother Nature did what she does best and sprang a storm on us. The rains were so fast, so heavy. We never saw the slide coming. All I did see was my dad disappear. I tried to get to him, but um, I couldn't. Besides, it was too late. He was gone. Um, we should um, we should probably turn in, yeah? - Wait. I'm so sorry. - Yeah... - Goodnight. - Goodnight. ♪ Daddy was a wise man ♪ ♪ That told me I could be anything ♪ ♪ Said "One day you're gonna grow up ♪ ♪ And be a man like me" ♪ ♪ He said "Son, please listen ♪ ♪ To the words in my heart ♪ ♪ You have the courage of a warrior ♪ ♪ Always remember that part" ♪ ♪ Every scar you get, well ♪ ♪ I'll be there to lift you up ♪ - This morning, I'm gonna show Finn that I can do more than home, I can do anything I put my mind to, including get breakfast out here. Yeah, Parker! Yeah, baby! Alright land, show me some food. Okay. - Ain't got no flat iron out here in the wild! Oh, I don't believe it! Daddy. I got your lucky hat. - Parker! Parker! Make yourself big, Park. Make yourself big. Parker! Dad! - Dad! - Parker! Finn! - Parker... don't move. - I'm not. - Hey! Get! Get out of here! Get! - Wait a minute. - It worked! - Hey! - That's right, merry Christmas! Did you see that? It worked! I guess Gary's hat is the luck hat after all. - Look what I found. - Yeah, maybe. - What's going on? - Oh, nothing. I just, it's a little cut, but I'll be fine. - Are you sure? - I'll be good, yeah. How are you? Are you alright? - That was, that was something. Did you see that? - I saw it. Let's get out of here. - Finn! - Finn, do you copy? - Something must have thrown him off, because it's not like Finn to just leave his pack behind. - Yeah, I'm not getting anything on Parker's GPS. - Parker, Parker, come in. - Listen, don't worry. Our boy, he'll be back. - I gotta call Gary. - I have to use your radio. - I threw it to scare the wolf. That's the way, right? Okay, alright, I can do it... - Oh no, no, no, it could break at the top at any time, and I'm not doing that again. - Well, we gotta get back. - We have to make shelter. Here, come here. Give me your pack. Take the smaller rope! - Yeah? - And tie it the best you can between the two trees. - Okay. - How you doing over there? - Okay! - You good? - Yeah! - Alright. Take this end here. - I see. Okay. It's alright. Here, you're gonna be okay. We have six hours. I've gotta make the call, I've gotta do it. It's protocol. Oh boy. - Monty here. - Hey, Monty, it's Gary here. Listen, I don't want to panic anybody, but we're just working right now to locate Finn. - Oh, don't panic. It's Finn, he's probably off on some wild side adventure, that's what he does, right? Hopefully, he's with Parker getting some amazing footage. Right, right, right. - Only, there's the thing, uh, Parker, she's not here either. And well, Finn's gear is here, too. - What? What are you saying to me right now? So, no footage? - Of course, Monty. We've been doing this a long time, we've got some beautiful footage. It's just, our focus right now on body cam footage, we're just trying to find the bodies. Not the bodies, we're trying to just locate the talent. - Oh my, damn. - I'm just gonna let you go, if you can hear me. Can you hear me? I'm over and... - I need a drink. I'm good. Careful. Step where you step, right? Yeah, right here is good. Ooh, got that one. ♪ Don't be afraid to let go ♪ ♪ It could help you grow ♪ ♪ Let your compass inside be your guide ♪ ♪ And know that you can be free ♪ ♪ If you only believe ♪ ♪ There's so much more just beyond your comfort zone ♪ ♪ And know that you're not alone ♪ Please tell me you know where we are. - We're halfway up the mountain. - That's not what I meant. - Don't worry, I know where we need to get to. - So in other words, where we are is not part of the plan, is it? - No, it's not. And neither was that wolf. - So, how do we get to where we're supposed to go if where we are isn't part of the plan? - The sun and the moon, the stars, and this. - A compass? Why don't we just go back the way we came? - Because that stream's a raging river now, it'll take too long to get around it and find safe crossing. - Alright, well let's build a fire. - Sure, we could build a fire and hope someone sees us, or we could start moving and hope we get to the extraction point. - Hope? - Yeah. - Do you know what hope is? It means that you'd like for something to happen, but there's no certainty that it will. - Really? Because I always thought that hope was to embrace the unknown. - You really are a cowboy! This is crazy! What are we even doing this for, ratings? We don't need ratings, we need a helicopter! We need to get me out of here and home for Christmas! Because I am not dying out here because of the cold or the exposure, or animals, or whatever else is... - Hey, hey, hey. We're gonna get through this, alright? I mean, look at what you've done so far. Whether you realize it or not, you are prepared. You have everything you need, here. And your instincts will take care of the rest, you just have to trust yourself, and me. Because I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. Can I carry your pack? - I got it, it's okay. How's your leg? - I'll be alright. Let's get you home for Christmas, shall we? Come on, give me your hand. - ♪ This life's adventure will lead you home ♪ - Wait a minute, hang on! Are these mineral hot springs? - They sure are. You can find them all over these mountains. - Well come on. - Wait, wait, we should really find shelter. - We should really get your leg healed. Healing is right here, so come on. You the scientist, you know about minerals and healing wounds, come on! - What you doing? - What? - You can't just splash some water on a gash on your leg! You got to put your whole leg in there. - Alright, Dr. Parker has spoken and if I'm going in, you're gonna follow. - You are killing me today, Mr. Finn Holt. With your sprinkle sprinkle. - Oh, alright. Okay. - So um, what happened in the dark that scared you? - Hm? - That made you think nothing good comes of it? - My freshman year in college, my mom got sick, and my parents didn't tell me because they thought it was going to distract me from my studies. So by the time they told me, she was, she was pretty bad off, and um, I felt like I was in the dark. There was nothing I could do, and I felt helpless. - I'm sorry. - Yeah, me too. So, I'm the way that I am about being prepared, because I swore that I would be able to handle whatever life threw at me. - Except being prepared doesn't always prevent things from happening. - It could. - So, you honestly believe that you could've saved your mother's life, if you were told sooner? - Well that's just it, Finn, I'll never know. Little pain, okay? - Okay, okay, okay. - Alright, alright. Oh, well, I can't let you have all the fun. Nope. - Ooh, nice. - Chopper's flying out in the morning. Why would I lose my Christmas bonus? There is more than liability at stake here, Judy, so unless you would like a lump of coal in your stocking, I suggest you think about that. - Hey, Monty, any word? - Nothing yet. - Nothing? Oh my god, poor Parker. I know she's absolutely freaking out right now. - You and I both know this is her worst nightmare. - It's good, right? - Ah. Better now. - Mm-hmm. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Yeah, now that I think about it, you never have been injured on your show before. - Never. - So, why was this different? - I guess I lost my head when I saw you could be in danger. That's why when I'm not doing the show, I prefer to be alone. I gotta eat something. Gary and Kat must be so worried. - They've been doing this a long time, they know what to do. Hold up. I ain't eating bugs. Hold on, I've got us a little treat. - Um, yeah you got us a treat! - Hey! - Hey, nothing! Open them up, come on. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. This moment right here, is one of the things that you can never plan for. It's one of the many experiences that you'll never have if you don't allow yourself to. So not knowing isn't always a bad thing. - Maybe I will share that with my audience. I love what I do. Getting to know people, really digging deep. Not many in our industry can say that their brand is their passion. - I agree with that. - Yeah. But still... - There's an expectation. - Yes. - To be that person that our audience perceives us to be. - Mm-hmm. - And not reveal anything that could change or spoil that. - But, what if, what if it didn't spoil anything, but it gave them that expanded view of who you really are? - Yeah, yeah that's good. I think we should get going. - Hey, we're going to be okay, right? It feels much colder. - That's why we need to keep moving. I think you're really going to love our shelter for the night. Yeah, this'll do. May not be toasty, but it's dry at least. I'll take it. So what happens after Christmas? Assuming we make it. - Well, after we do the show, I head home to the U.K. Then I'm off to the Outback for six months, gotta deliver on the fifth season. - Right. - Yeah. - And Christmas? - Oh, nothing special, really. Not like you, anyway. You have set the bar pretty high. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I went out on my own. - Hey... - Sorry. - No, you weren't afraid to go it alone. You came out of your comfort zone, you shouldn't be sorry for that. What you had is what I call a Holt Moment. - Are you telling me you got a Holt on me? Alright. I still can't believe I broke my own rule and left without my pack. - First time? - Yeah. - Thank you for saving me. Actually, I think you handled that wolf all on your own. - No. - I do, yeah. - I would've thought that um, I would've thought that with what happened with your dad, I don't know why I thought that it would have made you afraid of all of this. - You would think that, yeah. But uh, after the river took him, I was determined to conquer anything and everything the world threw my way. Because I swore I'd never let it take me down again. Never. - "It" being losing someone you love? - You're doing it again. - You're the son of an archeologist, you know the value of digging deep. - Let's get some sleep, shall we? - Are you warm enough? - Mm-hmm. - Here... - You okay? - Yeah. ♪ So here we are ♪ ♪ Lost in the moment love's taking over ♪ ♪ Wish upon the stars ♪ ♪ That love's great adventure has no end ♪ ♪ I believe in us ♪ ♪ So come take this journey with me ♪ ♪ I know that you will find everything you need ♪ ♪ Right here with me ♪ Parker!

Come on, we better move. - I just spoke to Monty. He wants us to sit tight. - So, where are we going? - The extraction point. Oh, it's so cold. Finn? - Don't worry, I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Come here, give me your hand. No sign of them yet, we'll circle back for another look. - Yeah! - There it is. We made it to the extraction point. - We made it. - We made it. Told you you could do it. You did great. - Alright. So what happens now? We just wait for the chopper, yeah? - Not quite. - Okay. - We gotta get down there, 'cause that's the extraction point. - Hold up, what you mean? - Gary and Kat will be there. That's down there. - Right. - But we up here. - Correct. - How we supposed to get down there, Finn Holt? - Same way you got out of the helicopter. You got this. Their GPS hasn't worked since the storm. Cancel that endorsement. Alright, this is about as close as we can get. Okay, let's go. Red flag, there's the extraction point! - Oh, they've got to be close. There they are! Oh, I knew my boy would make it. Okay, radio the chopper. - This is Kat, we've got eyes on them - at the extraction point. - Roger that. - Judy, I just spoke to the pilot, the choppers have found them. Everything is going to be fine. - Alright Parker, now listen, alright? When you prepare to descend, you need to lean back into the harness and keep yourself stable. - Wait a minute, you're not doing this with me? - I can't risk the rope coming loose, I need to make sure it holds for you. - I've never done anything like this before. Why can't we just wait for the chopper? - Because there's no place for the chopper to land. - You need to stop bringing people to places where you can't land your chopper, sir. - We'll be alright, okay? It's gonna be fine. Because of anything that's happened in the last 72 hours, have you ever done any of it? - No. - Were you prepared for any of it? - Hell no. - Are you ready now? - Then let's finish this adventure. Yeah. That's why he got her He's doing exactly what he planned all along. - It's gonna be a great episode. - You know it. - Here we go. - Okay. - You ready? - Almost. Ready. - Alright. Alright, hold out here. Good. Now, there are four things you gotta remember, alright? Balance, footing, rope. - Got it. Good. - What's the fourth thing you want me to remember? - That Christmas dinner with your family that's waiting for you. Okay, now on my count, you're gonna release the tension with this rope, and step off. Okay? - Okay? - Alright, I've got you. Alright. On three, two, one... - That was one? - That was one. - Did I move? - You're still here. - Again. - Alright. Three, two, one... There you go, Parker. Feel that? I got you. You got this. - I don't know about that anymore. Alright. Perfect, yes! - Finn! - It's okay, I'm here. Look, all you gotta do is push off and let the tension go, alright? - Okay.

You are glowing, I need to know what happened on that mountain. - Nothing! - Something happened. - Storms. - Listen girl, we were all so worried about you.

Here we are. - Thanks, Gary. - Are you sure about this? You know, I've seen you help a lot of guests, you know, be vulnerable, do things they've never done before.
