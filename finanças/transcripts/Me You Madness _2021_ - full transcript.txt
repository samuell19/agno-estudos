(INSPIRING MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (THUNDER CLAPPING) (INSPIRING MUSIC) (UPBEAT MUSIC) CATHERINE: This is the boardroom of Obsidian Capital. To clarify, it's my boardroom and Obsidian is the hedge fund I founded 19 days before I turned 30. This year, "Wealth and Assets" ranked me number 25 in its list of highest earning hedge fund managers. Right now, my team of strategists and I are discussing the investment of $450 million US into Exo oil. Stick it in this and we'll sit around and assess the long-term investment. You want me to stick it in some shitty company that can't even make its own damn revised earnings because its CEO whose tiny balls are bigger than his brains completely fucked their ability to earn a buck? You want me to invest a fuck ton of money because he might do better in Q4 based on your early indicators? And what are those exactly, hmm? Some moron leading the sheep on CNBC? A fucking seeking alpha article? Or are you actually moronic enough to believe this shit for brains when he says he's turning the company around when really what he's doing is just buying himself some time before the board realizes he's decimated their value and fucking fires him? Uh, is this because I'm a guy? I won't persecute you for having a penis, Patrick, more for your piss poor judgment. Now got back to your desks and make some fucking money. Thank you, thank you. (SIGHS) Shit management, shit fundamentals, shit value prop, coffee? And you want me to lever it up to the tits because it might pass some bullshit technical if there's enough fucks as stupid as you investing in this? TOM: Catherine, I really don't think the fundamentals in management are as bad as you think. We need to quickly assess what our next investment is going to be now that we've freed up some capital and I think that Jet-Ero-Tech could be the right choice. Spiders are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all other orders of organisms. Spiders exist on every continent except for Antarctica. Did you know that? There are no fucking spiders in Antarctica? Spider sex is an infamously dangerous activity, especially for males. Females will often cannibalize their mates after sex, sometimes during. Males will be males. They want it so badly they risk copulatory suicide in order to get it. Look Tom, if you want to catch this falling knife with your own money feel free. Don't come crying when it slips through your hands and takes your left nut. We sure as fuck aren't putting any of my client's money in this. My name is Catherine Black. I'm not going to tell you my age because it doesn't fucking matter. I'm a fucking shape shifter, I can look any age I want. I take excellent care of myself. (UPBEAT MUSIC) I live an extremely detail oriented lifestyle. During the week I wake up at five a.m. precisely. I'm happy when I wake up because I remember that I am me and my life is incredible. In the morning, I make a double espresso and eat half a grapefruit and one boiled egg. It has just enough calories to fuel my body to work out but it is not so many that it will take my body out of fat burning ketosis. At 5:20 a.m., I get on my Peloton bike and take my favorite class with Kathy who's a spin instructor in New York. Sometimes I go out to spin class because everyone needs a really enthusiastic leader in the front row. I don't like it when people sit in the front row and don't keep up with the tempo and choreography. It shows a lack of self-awareness and it is incredibly disrespectful to the rest of the class. I use exclusively Lalare products because they are the best. They're environmentally friendly, ocean conscious and don't test on animals. Fashion is the most important thing in my life. My favorite designers are Alexandre Ford, Tom Vouitre, and Ralph Ashley, but only RA collection or violet label. I am rarely if ever comfortable, but I always looking incredibly stylish which is much more important. The next most important thing to me is the accumulation of money. I was not born with money so I learned its value early on. Money empowers us to acquire the other things we like in life. It also allows us to avoid the things we do not like, such as mediocre restaurants, bad fashion style and commercial air travel. ♪ Jump for my love ♪ ♪ Jump in and feel my touch ♪ CATHERINE: By now, you've probably figured out that I'm a materialistic, narcissistic, self-absorbed, raging misanthrope. I don't deny it. I may or may not have an undiagnosed personality disorder, which manifests itself in extremely antisocial attitudes and behaviors. I also have an acute lack of conscience. This is my therapist, Dr. Angela F. Kristofferson, BA, MD, MSW, LPC, PHD, ABCD. I don't come here once a week for treatment, I come here because I like to prove to myself that I possess such extreme intelligence and willpower that I can easily hide my madness from everyone around me, including my own psychiatrist. You may think that this is a straight rip off of "American Psycho" and in some ways you may be right, but this is a woman's tale. We women are having a moment right now and this is what we call in Hollywood an elevated story concept, AKA the same but different so shut the fuck up, turn off your cell phones and enjoy the movie. MANDY: Have a great weekend, girlboss. CATHERINE: You too, Jennifer. MANDY: Oh, it's Mandy, but that's okay. (UPBEAT MUSIC) (CAR BEEPING) (UPBEAT MUSIC) This is an Aston Martin Vanquish. It was driven by James Bond in the 2002 film "Die Another Day". It has a more powerful engine, improved aerodynamics and a six speed electro-hydraulic manual transmission. It has a top speed exceeding 200 miles per hour. This car cost me $294,950, and it was worth every penny. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Siri, call the Lucky Nail Pro. SIRI: Calling Lucky Nail Pro. (GENTLE MUSIC) (PHONE BUZZING) Lucky Pro Nail, may I help you? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Ow. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Okay, okay, I come to your house tonight. 6:30, okay? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) bitch. (CAR ZOOMING) I work 80 hour weeks, but the weekends, they're for pure unbridled fun and pleasure. There is nothing I look forward to more than my Friday night drive from the city to Malibu as I ponder the weekend ahead. I expect this evening to be particularly interesting. Oh shit, I'm late for my five o'clock. (TIRES SCREECHING) (CAR BEEPING) Hey, watch where you're going, cocksucker. (CAR ZOOMING) I may seem perfect, it's true, but I'm not above admitting I have my flaws like the next gal. For example, I'm an addict. I'm addicted to a variety of things, namely cocaine, champagne, excessive exercise, sex, expensive shoes and indescribable violence. (TIRES SCREECHING) Hi, I have an appointment at five o'clock about renting the room. CATHERINE: You're late. You're late too. I had an $18 million crisis to solve. What's your excuse? I had to stop for gas. Okay, follow me. Smart ass. (TIRES SCREECHING) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) Hi... Catherine. Tyler. Sorry. What for? For being late or cutting me off? Both. Goodness, we're going to get swept away out here. Come on in. COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Welcome home. Nice digs. Home sweet home. Do you want a drink? I'm good. Thank you. Huh? I'm good, thank you. Sorry, I'm good, thank you. Don't mind me, but I need a fucking drink. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (SPOON CLANKING) Stirred, not shaken. Stirred, wet and just little bit dirty. So what does your husband do? Why do you think I'm married? You need a Zamboni to clean that thing. Birthday present. Generous friend. Is she single? I bought it myself year I made partner. So you're a lawyer? Finance. Cool. So you like work in a bank? Cool, so like I run a hedge fund. Sweet. And there it is, the gaping chasm between us, the mind-blowing ignorance and stupidity of the later millennial generation. I think I'm going to disembowel this kid and eat his spleen. So Tyler, why are you looking to move? Why are you looking for a roommate? I travel a lot. I need to find a babysitter for my house. Gotcha. Why are you looking to move? My roommate is a dick. Lie number one. Tyler is in fact a petty thief and con man who responds to ads online for room rentals in other people's houses only so that he can steal from them. What he is doing right now is casing my house, or so he thinks. What he doesn't realize is that his being here is entirely by my own design. Hmmm, okie dokie, it's 1,500 a month. You have full use of the house except my bedroom. That's off limits. - Got it? - Got it. - Got it? - Got it. - Got it? - Got it. (DINGING) Great, let me go get out of these clothes. (POPPING LIPS) Another striking ensemble. Thank you. Let me give you the tour. This is the living room. Got it. Only rule in here is no red wine. More of a beer guy myself. Good. This is the dining room. Nice painting. Is it expensive? That's a revolting question, Tyler. Follow me. Monday through Fridays there's a housekeeper. She does the laundry, the dishes, et cetera. Would she do mine too? Well yes, that was my point. Sweet. This is the gym. You lift? (COOL MUSIC) Every single day. This is the garage. 1968 classic Mustang? CATHERINE: He's about to tell me he's surprised I own this car because I am a woman. Of all the cars a chick could want, you got a Mustang? You didn't want like a cherry red Porsche 911 e-convertible or a Corvette? CATHERINE: I'm feeling annoyed because he's stupider than I expected and he's about to make a movie reference, probably "Bullet". It's like right out of "Bullet". CATHERINE: If he knew anything about cars, he'd know "Bullet" was a Highland green '68. This is a candy apple red '65. Magic tricks are about directing attention. I select these fabrics on purpose. Today I'm pleased as there is a breeze. It's giving lift to the fabric which creates an almost slow motion ethereal quality. Do you like it? Hmm? The house, do you like it? It's a dream. No neighbors, huh? You could throw some pretty sweet parties, won't get any noise complaints. No, there never is. (PHONE BEEPING) COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Activate party mode. (DANCE POP MUSIC) Party mode. (DANCE POP MUSIC) Sometimes I come out here at night to look at the stars, the vast quantity of the universe spread out like a blanket of diamonds. Sometimes I feel so powerful that I could fly, and I mean actually, literally fly. And I have. Flown? This is where I test the strength of his decision-making matrix. I have made a statement that can only be described as completely insane. Right now he should probably leave but his desire for material enrichment and a potential sex encounter is standing in the way of his need for self-preservation. It is a fascinating juxtaposition. (LAUGHING) Dude, I'm just fucking with you. God, you should've seen your face. That was too easy. I'm an idiot. For a moment there, I thought you were a psycho and you were gonna chop my head off and throw it in a burlap sack. Well, we can't rule that out but I cannot fly, I'll tell you that much. Chad, it's a two-fer. She's a total MILF. I'm talking magna cum laude pussy and the house is insanity. I think I actually want to get the room. Like actually? Actually. Dude, don't get carried away. Keep your focus on the task at hand. All right, but I'm pretty sure she wants me, man. Cocky little bastard. CHAD: How old is she? It doesn't matter, man, her body is tight. I think she wants a young man around the house to keep things serviced, you know what I mean? You're not that young pal. Gotcha. Dude, just stick with the M.O., grab what you can and get the fuck out of there. All right. Hmm, you're not going anywhere. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) You heading out? No. Dress is fire. Thank you, Tyler. You can really hold your booze for a wee gal, huh? Join me. I'm driving. Uber. Come on, let's have a drink and chat roomie. Cheers. Cheers. Octane. Number three. Smooth, isn't it? So do you have family, Tyler? Not that I see anymore. Hmm, that's sad, I'm sorry. I'm not. What about you? Just my grandmother. Incredible woman, we're very close. Top up? Take it easy, Flanigan, it ain't cocktail. Loosen up. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (SIGHS) (CRUNCHING APPLE) Tyler? You okay? Yeah. ILF. Huh? I'm an ILF, not a MILF. I'm not a mother. (DOORBELL RINGING) Ooh, nail time. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Da Vinci. Uh, (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE). Alfred Nobel. Peter the Great. (LAUGHING) (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Madonna. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Good match. (TYLER SNORING) (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) You're right, no one has any work ethic anymore. Exactly. After getting my nail fixed and being absolutely obliterated in Trivial Pursuit Tien-Tang, Tyler was still out cold. So I realized I could squeeze in a little workout. I have a deep appreciation for '80s music and rigorous exercise routines. I like to wear leotards while doing my butt crunches. I can do 1,000 now. I also like legwarmers, sweatpants and the color pink. Oh bloody hell, he's still out cold. I hope it didn't fucking kill him. That would take all the fun out of it. Hmm, still breathing. Resting heart rate around 60 BPM. Man, I've really got to take a dump. (FARTS) Small cap stocks outperformed with the Russell 2000 up 5% and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 35.5%. Making money is incredibly arousing. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) Wonder what I'm going to make for dinner tonight. Maybe a casserole, hmm. Hmm. And for one blessed moment in time a woman harasses the shit out of a man. Oh, shut it PC police. No one wants to hear you bitch about it. It's fucking hilarious.

It's a Dynacraft Magna Gravel Blaster boys' BMX street bike, Tyler, obviously. Yeah, but what's it doing here? Nephew's birthday. You have a nephew? Yes Tyler. Why does that surprise you? Well, for one you only mentioned having a grandmother and two, you struck me as an only child kind of person. I'm 72.5% sure that was an insult. I didn't mention my sister because she lives in Fresno which makes her as good as dead, not to mention she's married, has three kids, a suburban life and is no doubt utterly miserable with what she's accomplished in life. I cannot imagine anything more dreadful. Than living in Fresno? Than being married with kids. Come on you don't want to grow old alone. I won't be alone. I'll have stuff.

I couldn't even focus on my wardrobe. This is a typical reaction to the feeling of losing control. I was getting sloppy. How did I not see it coming? Of course he would steal the car. On the rare occasion that I find myself in a bind I find my way out with undeniably exhausting ease. I wonder why I'm getting messy. Maybe deep down I just want a fucking challenge, some situation that I can't simply unfuck. And Tyler is proving to be exactly that. And I mean that theoretically as well as literally. Ugh, I have to pull myself together. And as most girls will agree, the best way to pull yourself together is with a fantastic outfit. I was 100% percent focused on finding Tyler.

I mean stock dropped 40 points in the last 20 minutes. No I mean his dick. PAT: I mean fairly big, you know nothing to be embarrassed about, that's for sure. But the stock- - I sold it all 18 minutes ago, you numb nut and I would hardly describe that as big. No offense, but you must have a tiny pecker, Pat. PAT: Fuck. You thieving treacherous little shit.

If you are not back here in one hour with my car I am sending all of this information to the LAPD. WAZE: We're ready, let's go. Your drive time is 59 minutes. Okay, Waze is saying 59 minutes. That's kind of cutting it close, hun, I mean we're all the way in Los Feliz right now. Can you make that 90 minutes? Ugh, whatever. And Tyler, leave Chip at home. WAZE: We're ready, let's go. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) CATHERINE VOICEOVER: I had emerged from the abyss and had regained control of the situation. I was wearing my favorite new Alexandre Ford suit, which I had just had tailored to perfection and my champagne was chilled to a perfect 37 degrees Fahrenheit. There was just one thing left to do, decide how to dispose of Tyler. The nail gun? Let's add that to the list of movie weapon tropes that don't necessarily reflect real life. Featuring in everything from "Casino Royale" to "Lethal Weapon II", this handyman tool has become a fixture on the silver screen. Next. (GUNSHOT) Oh God, that's really cliché, isn't it? Hmm, it's been in like every other movie that I can think of. For example, "Dirty Harry", "Atomic Blonde", "Tomb Raider", "Taxi Driver", "Deadpool" one, two and probably three. "Taxi Driver" had a gun in it? "Shooter." "Zero Dark Thirty", "The Last Train from Gun Hill", "The Way of the Gun", "Charlie's Angels", "Die Hard", "Top Gun", "John Wick", "American Sniper", "The Matrix", "Gun Crazy", "Skyfall", "The Naked Gun Two and a Half", "Savages", "Wonder Woman", "Navy Seals" "James Bond", "Machine Gun Preacher", "Two Guns", (VOICE SQUEAKING) Not in this movie, folks. I don't even like guns. These are nunchucks. Nunchucks are cool. MALE: Oh yeah. They're cool for two reasons. Number one, Bruce Lee used them in many of his movies including "Enter the Dragon", which was one of my favorites. The second reason that they're cool is because I just like the word, nunchucks. I don't know if it's one word or two but I know I like it. Nunchucks, nunchucks, nunchucks, nunchucks. I can also do really cool shit with them like this. (NUNCHUCKS SWISHING IN AIR) (GRUNTING) Oh please, I could never pull this off with the panache Charlize did in "Atomic Blonde". CATHERINE VOICEOVER: It was a shame I had to kill Tyler. I really did enjoy the sex and he was blessed genetically with an absence of body hair and pleasingly symmetrical genitalia which I could no longer enjoy the benefit of once I cut it off and fed it to him. I also had to confess a strange feeling of admiration for his craftiness. I viewed his deception and escape as rather an achievement. Ew, feelings. (GROWLING) (UPBEAT '80S MUSIC) (GASPS) What? It's just the tip. (UPBEAT '80S MUSIC) ♪ I caught you smiling ♪ ♪ I know I've seen you here before ♪ (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (DOOR CLICKS SHUT) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (SCREAMING) What are you doing here? What's on your face? An instant magic facial mask. You told me to come immediately. Well Waze said 59 minutes. You look hideous. Why are you holding a kitchen knife? I don't really know. BOTH: Why are we shouting? Look, it's only been about 32 minutes and you said you were in Los Feliz. I figured I had time to do a quick facial. I'm sorry I interrupted. The Waze was accounting for an accident which happened on the 10 which cleared up pretty fast. There wasn't much traffic otherwise. Did you bring my car back? Yes, I did. Are you wearing my jewelry? Yes, I am. It looks nice. Thank you. Like I kind of think you could start a new thing. Right? I feel like I can totally pull it off. Totally. Like why can't men wear jewelry? Like why can't they? BOTH: Totally. That is not a good look. Would you like me to wait in the living room? That would be very nice, thank you. (SUAVE '80S MUSIC) TYLER: So shiny.

Now can you delete the info you have on me now? (ICE CRACKLING) I don't think so. Can you delete the info you have on me now, please? Thank you. Nope. I thought we had a deal. I'm not bound by a code of ethics, Tyler and apparently neither are you. You stole from me, even though we zinged. We did zing, right? 100% zing. So zinged. Zing a ding. Zing a ding a ling dong. Zingtastic. That is besides the point. All right, you promised me that if I brought you car back- - Uh promises, promises, they're made to be broken. Look. Don't you ever touch me. (DARK MUSIC) Tag. Huh? (GLASS BREAKING) (GRUNTING) Oh fuck that really escalated. Are you on your period? (GRUNTING) (TYLER YELLING) Fuck! Oh my God, what are you doing? Tying up lose ends. Is that all I am to you, a loose end? Don't take it personally, baby, back in a minute. ♪ Dark in the city ♪ - ♪ Night is a wire ♪ - (TYLER YELPING) ♪ Steam in the subway, Earth is afire ♪ ♪ Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo ♪ ♪ Woman, you want me, give me a sign ♪ ♪ And catch my breathing even closer behind ♪ ♪ Do do do do do do do dodo ♪ Oh Catherine. You wouldn't. Put the knife down or the couch gets it. Is that the 1969 Chateau Lafite? Inky burgundy in color, this full-bodied vintage is moody, complex and dense, fragrant with notes of chocolate, cedarwood, sandalwood, black tea and banana, it has an alluring whiff of mahogany and creme de cassis which pulls you in deep to its black currant center. The beautiful tannins and intense cocoa beans are palpable. Well shit, this is a calamity. I will Chateau Lafite the fuck out of this couch. That's a sofa. It's a couch. No baby, I think you'll find that that is a sofa. Mmm, couch. Mmm, sofa. Mmm, couch. (LAUGHING) It's a sofa. It's a couch. It's a sofa. Damn couch. - Sofa. - Couch. - Sofa. - Couch. - Sofa. - Couch. - Sofa. - Couch. - Sofa. - Couch. - Sofa. - Couch. - Sofa. - It's a couch. - Sofa. - Couch. Sofa. Let's agree to disagree. All right, get in the kitchen and stay there. Hide and seek? Count to 100. Okay. Just so you know, the Lafite is a $50,000 bottle and that sofa is Lamotte, Italian. It had an eight month lead time and cost me 73 grand. (TYLER CHUCKLES) Think about what you're doing. Do you have no soul? Have you ever wondered if there was something better you could spend your money on instead of wine and furniture? Well no, I can't say I have. I mean like what? I don't know, a charitable foundation perhaps. I'm a self-serving, materialistic, narcissistic, homicidal sociopath, Tyler. I mean a charitable foundation is not exactly keeping with my character. Damn, you're really hard on yourself, hun. I don't think you're any of those things. I think you're a really wonderful girl. You should really work on your self esteem. You really are so sensitive and sweet sometimes. You know, I try. Now if you come out of that kitchen before 99, I swear to fucking God, I will unload this entire bottle like a human fucking sprinkler. And it won't just be the couch. Sofa. It's a couch. Sofa. It's a couch. CATHERINE: It's a fucking sofa. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Come on. Come on. Come on. It's not gonna start. Why not? I put two bottles of Tide in the tank. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Speedy little sucker. (TYLER GASPS) Cat's out of the bag I guess. Tell me you did not feed me a bunch of dudes. I did not feed you a bunch of dudes. I'm not sensing a whole lot of authenticity there, Catherine. Did you feed me a bunch of dudes? Look only two or three. (GASPS) Possibly four, maybe parts of five, but I mean who's counting? I'm counting. I'm fucking counting. Oh. Oh baby, do you need some Pepto for your tum tum? (TYLER CHUCKLING) I'm sorry, what happened to the ice pick? It's been done before. Is that a fucking curling iron? Donair, double ceramic 1.25 inch barrel, delivers even heat, fast styling and long lasting curls. Also doubles as a totally unique and conventional, not cliché weapon. And you're gonna do what exactly with that, huh? I mean is that how the rest of these poor bastards went too with a fucking curling iron? (CURLING IRON THUMPING) (GRUNTING) Okay maybe I was wrong about the curling iron. Mmhmm. (GRUNTING) Stay down. Do not move, do not fucking move, okay? I am leaving. You have your car back, your jewelry back. Let's not let this thing escalate. I kind of feel like it's already escalated. I mean you stole my car and my jewelry. You have a stash of dead dudes in your freezer which you fed to me. I think that's textbook escalated. You're right, but there's no need to escalate this to the point of no return. I hate to be a party pooper baby but I kind of feel like we're there already. I'm inclined to disagree. All right I'm sorry I stole your car. I'm sorry I stole your diamonds, that was a prick move. I'm sorry I ever came to this house. I'm not sorry about the epic sex, but everything else I am sorry for truly. Now let's just hit the reset button and pretend we never met, okay? Sure, okay. Okay. 36 minutes? Well that blows. (THUMPING) (SIGHS) Eat it, Maria Sharapova. And that was a backhand, hmm. (BOTH GRUNTING) That hurt. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Now that's convenient. Fuck. (CHAINSAW WHIRRING) Really, another costume change? You were out cold for ages. I got a little bored. It looks nice. Thank you. You always kill in couture? (CATHERINE LAUGHS) Very funny. No seriously, have you got a cocktail party to go to? We are the party baby. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Mmhmm. (GRUNTING) Jesus Catherine, how many more are there? I lost count. (GRUNTING) You're fucking crazy. (GRUNTING) That is not nice. There's a freezer full of bodies. Listen, it's not what you think. It's a pile of frozen dead people. What am I misconstruing here? It's a pile of frozen dead bad people. What did they do? Bad things. Like what, huh? What did that guy do? MS-13. What about him? Pedophile. What about that guy? Rapist. - That guy? - Murderer. Ironic. What about him? - What did he do? - Meth dealer. - Him? - Sex trafficker. - That guy? - Homophobe. What about him? Neo-Nazi. - Him? - Bigot. - That guy? - Racist. - Hmm? - KKK. - Him? - Child porn. - Hmm? - Snuff tapes. - Hmm? - Human slave trade. - Hmm? - Antisemite. - Hmm? - Xenophobe. - Hmm? - Jimmy Hoffa. That was you? We had to be somewhere. What about him? What did he do? Evil foreign dictator. - Hmm? - Politician. - Hmm? - Republican. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) - Hmm? - Democrat. - Hmm? - Independent. - Hmm? - #fakenews. - Hmm? - Internet troll. - Hmm? - Al-Qaeda. Really? We don't have time for that story. Well what about him, huh? What did he do? Construction worker. He whistled at me and then called me a puta, totally unprovoked. I mean he had to go. What? No, I don't feel like I have to justify that. What about her? What did she do? She left her dog in a hot car. Really? It was July in Los Angeles in a Whole Foods parking lot. Now tell me what was so fucking delicious in the deli that day that warranted leaving a Schnauzer puppy in a locked Prius for 40 minutes? On a warm day, the temperature in a parked car can exceed 120 degrees in a matter of minutes. Yes folks, even with the windows partially open, your pet can suffer brain damage or die from heat stroke. So never ever leave your pet unattended in a parked car. I mean I suppose that probably goes for children too. (UPBEAT MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (THUNDER CLAPPING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GRUNTING) You broke my nail. Sorry sweetheart, I'd do anything for you except let you kill me with a fucking ax. (BOTH GRUNTING) - Fuck, don't drop me. - Are you okay? (CATHERINE FARTING) (CATHERINE LAUGHING) Gotcha! Sucker. (THUNDER CLAPPING) (BOTH GRUNTING) Why do you do this huh? You're a beautiful woman and you're rich. You have no reason to do this. I mean have you ever rationally considered your exposure to criminal prosecution? I think you'd go to jail for like ever. Not possible. Why not? Because I'm too good and too efficient at what I do and I don't leave evidence lying around. (BOTH GRUNTING) The way I see it I'm fulfilling two important things. What's that? First, my blood lust. (GRUNTING) Check. What's the other thing? I'm doing society a favor. Did you know that the cost of imprisoning California's 130,000 inmates is $11.4 billion per year? - Did you know that? - Huh? It costs taxpayers $75,560 to house one inmate for one year in California. I mean that's more than the annual tuition at Harvard. With plenty left over for pizza and beer. Exactly. So assuming I've picked off let's say around 100 of these guys give or take that means that I've saved the fine taxpayers of this state over $7.5 million. You're welcome, California. (GRUNTING) And thank you, Catherine. Oh please, you don't pay taxes. What makes you say that? If you are reporting the profits of your crimes to the IRS with unwashed money, you are even stupider than I thought. What crimes? You steal from old people, Tyler, including my granny, by the way. Which one was your granny? Cheviot Hills, pink hair, passion for lawn bull. You took her life savings. Ringing any bells? Uh. - Look at those girls. - Go girls. This is the one for you, I mean the numbers alone Betty, the numbers. (GRUNTING) Truce. Betty, Betty was your granny? Is that why I'm here? Initially it was. Okay, okay. Well for what it's worth, she was a really nice lady but I hardly think that that is murder worthy. She is a really nice lady, Tyler and I'm inclined to disagree. I think that stealing from the elderly is exceedingly fucked up. (GRUNTING) Not fucked up enough to deserve to die. That's subjective sweetheart. God, I'm thirsty, I'm getting that cotton mouth kind of thing, I'm dehydrated. Can we take a water break? Yeah, that'd be nice. I'm thirsty too. All right. I mean even if I were to agree that the punishment doesn't fit the crime, your very existence is a liability. Ever heard of corpus delicti? Corporate what? Corpus delicti, the body of evidentiary items, including physical, demonstrative and testimonial that can establish that a homicide has occurred. You've become a loose end, baby. I mean it'd be plain irresponsible to let you live. I'm not gonna tell anybody. I want to believe you, baby, I really do but you haven't exactly established a passion of honesty and brass in your life thus far. So tell me one thing, why the sex, huh? I mean why not just kill me when I arrived at your door? Was it all just some twisted preamble? That was just for fun. I mean you're very sexy. Why put that to waste? You think I'm attractive? Oh God yeah. Yeah, you're very sexy. I'm flattered. Don't be coy. You know you've got it. Well yeah, but I mean it's nice to hear it sometimes. I even liked you enough to let you go which trust me I have never done before. I wasn't even going to kill you, you're welcome, but then you had to steal my car, which had a dead body in it. And by the way, sidebar, I know you did that for retribution. It wasn't even about the money, was it? It was your way of saying na na na na na, poopy on your face because you were pissy that I kicked you out. I wasn't even gonna kill you when you brought the car back, you're welcome. That does speak volumes about your magnanimity. Right? But then you had to go snooping around and stumble on all of my dead bodies. And so look what you've done. You've backed me up into a corner. I mean you've just backed me into a corner. You've backed me right up in here and now I have no option but to get rid of you. That hurts my feelings. This situation is completely of your own making Tyler. You made a series of bad decisions, starting with ripping off my granny, which have led you to where you stand today. You're in the home of a serial killer with a Glock 19 in your face. I think you have to take some responsibility and be accountable for your actions. Okay, you're right, it's all my fault. (CATHERINE GRUNTING) (GLASS BREAKING) Oh shit. Ow. Time to die. Can we discuss this at least? Oh no, it's not debatable. Come on, I know you've got a soft spot for me. (TYLER GRUNTING) What? It's just the tip. Oh my God. Do you see how she just did that? I said that to her earlier in a sexual context referring to my penis and now she's repeating my own line back to me right here in this new context referring to this tiny pitchfork situation. Whoever wrote this is a fucking genius. Excuse me, I'm sorry, are you having your own little fourth wall breakage right now? No, no, we can't both have V.O's and break the fourth wall. This is my movie. Don't talk to them. All right. All right Jesus so possessive. Ooh, that looks kind of bad. I'm not very good with blood. I find that hard to believe, peaches. My own blood. You should probably do something about that. Right? I think so. Yeah. I mean would you mind taking a quick break? Not at all. Okay. Thanks. Of course. Just don't go anywhere. (GRUNTING) Not a lot of blood, huh? Kind of figured there'd be more blood than that. Well alrighty. CATHERINE: The truth is I really didn't want to kill Tyler. I absolutely adored the boy. But I had firmly resolved that it was my only option. So I decided I might as well have some bloody fun doing it. COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Activating party mode. Clever girl, party mode.

Eh, I had them all disassembled and then reassembled. You're crazy. That's been established. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Which one's the fastest? I really couldn't tell you. I have absolutely no idea because I've never driven a single one of them. I mean they all have absolutely zero mileage which of course makes them much more valuable. And your favorite? I'm rather partial to the red Ferrari. Care to dance? I should be delighted. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Did you ever stop to consider that killing me would be an absolute waste of great chemistry? Actually I did consider that mon cher. I thought about it a great deal while we were making sweet, sweet love last night. I was lost as a pet in the breeze, lost as a little boat at sea thinking of only you and me. And then I saw your slutty texts from Tiffany. (GRUNTING) Fuck, it's just the tip. That is a $600,000 Lamborghini Aventador. You could have had to plain decency to take the knife. She doesn't mean anything to me baby, I swear. Then why is she sending you pictures of her titties? I didn't respond. Because you were busy. Busy thinking about you, only and completely you. I mean, don't you get it? I adore you Catherine. You're the most special girl I've ever met. I can't breathe when I think about not being with you. I mean I know we're an odd fit but I really think we can make this work. I mean why can't we? We both did a bunch of bad shit, maybe we're bad people, but you make me want to be better, you make me want to be a better man. I'll do all those things you talked about. I'll go to college and finish my degree. I'll get a job, make an honestly living. I'll do anything you want. We can make this work. Just take a leap of faith with me. We're meant to be together. I know it. Catherine I think... I love you. (SLOW MUSIC) Catherine? Catherine? Well, how many points are we talking about here, Pat? No, I don't have time for this. Mmm, how many points... On a quick call, there's a lot of movement in Asian markets right now. You're on a work call right now? I'm sorry, it'll be quick. I am so disappointed. Here I am fully committed and present to this epic faceoff which you initiated and you were just off doing your own thing without any sense of commitment to what we started here. Movie fight scenes take a minimum of two people, okay? I can't do this on my own. Hit the bid for 10 blocks if it gets below 18.80. I'm sorry. I'm so disappointed. You're right. I apologize. It was selfish And noncommittal. And noncommittal. I mean do you even want to do this anymore? Oh baby... of course I do. (CHAINSAW WHIRRING) Oh please, a chainsaw? That would be so derivative of every other horror movie ever made. I mean think about it. "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", 1974, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre II", 1986, "Leatherface" "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III", 1990, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation", 1994, with Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey. "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Remake" in 2003 with Jessica Biel. "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (VOICE JUMBLING) Shit, they really did make a hell of a tot lot of Texas Chainsaw movies, didn't they? Can we get some fresh ideas please, Hollywood? For example, a crossbow. Now that's different and refreshing. Baby, what are you doing out here? I was conscious of your white couch. Sofa. Sofa. That's really considerate, Tyler, thank you. Look... when things are really important to a woman you got to listen. I see every miscommunication as an opportunity for relationship growth. That's so mature. I really appreciate that. Just trying to be a good man. Oh babe, a bread knife? I didn't see the crossbow coming. It's gonna be a slaughter. Yeah. That's no fun. Not for me. Tell you what? Let's even the playing field (TYLER GRUNTING) Shit. Babe, oh fuck, oh fuck, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, are you okay? Flesh wound. Are you sure? Let's get this thing over with. You ready baby? Ready as ever, peaches. Oh wait. In case you kill me. I think I'm madly in love with you. I will definitely kill you but I'm madly in love with you too. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) BOTH: Maybe we should get married. What, get married? - No. - Yes. - Yes? - No? BOTH: Truce. I won't tell anyone what you did if you don't tell anyone what I did. Deal. But you're gonna need to not kill me or eat me. What do you say? Fair enough. Want to fuck like rabbits, raise rugrats and live happily ever after? Fuck it. I'd do anything with you. (UPBEAT MUSIC) ♪ I don't know where to start or where to follow ♪ Doc, I think I may need to start some kind of medication. (DINGING) Hi baby. Hi. We live an extremely chilled out lifestyle. During the week, we wake up whenever we want. We're happy when we wake up because we remember that we are us and our lives together are incredible. We take a moment to make a gratitude list. I am now on a complex cocktail of mood stabilizing anti-psychotic pharmaceuticals and I no longer kill people. The authorities have not yet caught up to me for which I'm very grateful and also reassured of my own genius. I am back in engineering school. Catherine pays my tuition and I no longer live a life of crime or rip off old people. My beautiful Bae has helped me pay restitution to her grandma Betty and to all the others. And while I love having the benefit and enrichment of Catherine's earnings, I am very enthusiastic about graduation, rejoining the workforce and climbing the corporate ladder. At around eight or 10 a.m., we get on our Peloton bikes and take our favorite class with Kathy, who is a spin instructor in New York. CATHERINE: Sometimes we go out to spin class because it's an enjoyable social human interaction. (BOY GRUNTING) It's not nice to judge other people on their looks, beliefs, political persuasion, or lifestyle choices, people. Let's all just be a little kinder to one another. I now work from home in the mornings, which I find incredibly relaxing. In the morning, I make her a double espresso, half a grapefruit and one boiled egg. I also make us pancakes 'cause she could do with a little more cushion for the pushing. (CATHERINE GIGGLING) (KISSING) - I love you. - Love you. Hey kids. What's for dinner? BOTH: Vegan.
