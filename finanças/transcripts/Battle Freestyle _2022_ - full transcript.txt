[laughs] - Sorry. - Come on, my man. - Hey, is it that way? - Wrong side, bro. Okay, one more time. [Josef] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, lift. [dancers exclaim] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

You know, it's better to see opportunities instead of hurdles. Okay? Good. Come on, smile a little. There you go. Good. [man whistling] Hello and bonjour. We are happy to tell you that your crew has qualified to Break the Cypher Paris. Yes! [Moa] Go ahead. Pick a card. The queen. - [door closes] - [Moa] Lucky. - Hi! - [overlapping greetings] - [Alex] You can tell us know. - [Moa] Go ahead. [Amalie] What's up? You know I-I think you're awesome. You are all my heart. I've thought about it... and I have to leave the crew. - What? - There's no crew without you, bro. I'm gonna have a kid. [Alex] What? What? Congratulations! Bro! You're gonna be a father? A real father? - A real father. Yeah. - Can't believe it, bro. - So cool! - Yeah. Yeah. But I don't get why you have to leave the crew. I can't pay the bills with dancing. - What if we could? - [Alex] Know anyone who can sponsor us? [air horn blows] Hello. Bonjour. We are happy to tell you that your crew has qualified to Break the Cypher Paris. The winner of the competition will receive a cash prize of 30,000 euros. Congrats and welcome. We can't wait. We got in! Oh, my God! Let me see! Oh, shit. [excited laughter] Yo! - [Alex] We got in! - Paris! - [Mikael] You're in, right? - First, we have to have a show. Then we have to qualify for the battle. Then we have to win the battle. Have to, bro? It's us! Yeah, yes, come on! Come on. Please? Paris, here we come! [excited whooping] [all chanting] Illicit! Illicit! Illicit! Illicit! DAD CONNECTING... We qualified for Paris! No way! That's great! [laughs] I'm so proud of you. I know how hard you've worked for this. How are you? Do you have your students under control? Ah, yeah, under control. It's actually really fun. - Yeah? - Yeah, yeah, it is. [both laughing] Ai yai yai yai yai. Just think. Paris, huh? [Amalie laughs] Hey, maybe you can get in touch with your mother over there. Ah, no. Um... I don't know. Could be... could be a nice opportunity. - I can't just show up like that in Paris. - Well... She has made it pretty clear she doesn't want anything to do with me. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... I just thought... But you can handle this any way you like, okay? [romantic pop music] [Amalie laughs] [gunfire over laptop] THE ACADEMY OF DANCE IN PARIS PROFESSORS VIVIAN PRYTZ ADD FRIEND [alarm ringing] [groans sleepily] ALARM Hmm. - Your alarm went off, Amalie. - Okay. That's your mom, isn't it? Have you thought about contacting her when we get there? I don't know. Um, I have to go to work. But I thought you didn't want anything to do with her. Uh... Can... can you not say anything to the others? I just don't want it to become a thing. I promise. Thanks. - Bye, then. - Bye-bye. - I love you. - Love you, too. [door closes] - Hi. - Hey. Take a seat. - So, can I offer you anything? - No, thank you. - Apple, banana? - Nothing, thanks. I'm fine. You sure? Can you help me out? I'm trying to stay away from sugar. [Amalie] Hmm. So, I was wondering if I could have some time off so I could go to a dance competition. - Now? - Just for one week. But I can get a temp and just take care of it all, so it'll be very easy to take over. No. Uh, I must say no unfortunately to your request. If I'm gonna be completely honest, I gotta tell you, it's a little inappropriate to ask for time off right after the holidays. - I am still allowed to request it. - You're allowed. But how would things work if everyone asked for time off after vacation, to knit or go fishing or organize their postage stamp collection? But I can take care of it. I can work late before and after. You don't need to worry... The answer is no! Work is work. Hobbies are for our free time. Hey, this is not a hobby! - Okay, Amalie. I understand. - I have to go to that competition. Then you won't have a job to come back to. Fine. I'm quitting. Fucking prick. [upbeat pop song playing] [phone chimes] MIKAEL THE LANDLORD CAME BY... WE HAVE 2 WEEKS TO PAY! Fuck! [laughs] Look! Over there! Bonjour! Yo! Break the Cypher. That's sick, bro. [Mikael] That the flyer for the competition? [indistinct chatter] [upbeat pop music continues] What should we write? Uh... [both] Paris... here we are! Oh, my God! So lame. - Awesome. - [Nice. [overlapping chatter] [Mikael] I gotta learn that. - [girl in French] Can I have a coin? - [man] Yes, of course. There you go. - Give it to her. - Oh, thank you. Do you think she'll react? Maybe. Wow. Did you see that? She dances. - [man] She's dancing for you. - Yes. It's really beautiful. Do you know how to dance like that? Yes! See you later. [indistinct chatter] DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT OF CLASSICAL DANCE [indistinct chatter] [phone clatters] [exhales] [in French] Is it your phone, miss? - Thank you. - You're welcome. [hip-hop music playing] [dancers whooping] [in English] You think it's free? [Mikael] I don't know. Hi. May I help you guys? Yeah. Uh, we booked a room. We're Illicit. Come with me. [Moa] Oh, my God! This is a palace! Damn! One crew. One destiny. Will they survive this fury of the battle? [Moa chuckles] Yo! Look. Free food. Oh, oh, dibs, dibs. Look what they got. Free T-shirts. Keychains! I'm sorry. There's been a mix-up. This room belongs to Raw-nez. - What? - [Mikael] Raw-nez? [Moa] Are they here? [dancers chattering] [Amalie] They look really good. You don't know who they are? [woman chattering in French] Salah. The guy's a living legend. Lil Kev over there, he has the sickest power moves. [dancer] Let's go, Tine! [Alex] And Tine is extremely versatile. And Junior, he's just out of this world. Sarah Bee. One of the world's best b-girls. [elevator rumbling] So, the rooms upstairs are the VIP rooms. You've booked an ordinary one. And we only have this one left. [Amalie] Okay. They do everything we do, only much, much better. But we can't give up now. We still have a chance. We just have to work hard. With this show, we don't stand a chance. Certainly not against that crew. We could change tactics. Just do an awesome trick that's never been done and totally blow everyone's mind. Unless someone learns to fly, we won't win. I'm glad I don't know anyone who's gonna watch. Huh? I just have to go somewhere. Meet you later. Amalie, are you okay? I'm fine. I'll meet you at practice later. Yo! You're just gonna leave us? Sorry! [Alex] Bad timing. We're making a plan here. [tender music playing] [woman laughing] [stops laughing] Excuse me. I, uh... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to just show up here like this. - I just... - Sweetheart. You don't need to say you're sorry at all. I am. I was just really surprised when I saw you. Shocked. But... [chuckles] ...I'm just really happy to see you. Really? Of course. You know, unfortunately, the bad news is that, well, I have to go. I have a recital to go to. Sure. You are more than welcome to come with me. Yeah? [applause] - That's one of my students. - How exciting. [phone buzzes] ALEX WHERE ARE YOU? WE HAVE PRACTICE! [exhales] [elegant classical music plays] [party-goers chatter] Everyone, meet Amalie. - Hello, Amalie. - Hi. I... Amalie from Norway. [laughter] Okay, you guys. There are three days until the competition. What are we gonna do? Well, we have passion, don't we? And we have to use that passion. We have to show them who we are and what we feel. [Josef] But that's just the show. If we make the final, we still have to battle Raw-nez. It'll be war. We'll win the battle if someone learns to fly. Yeah, right. I can fly. I didn't know you owned a flying manual, bro. Shh. Let me introduce the trick. Magic... Moa... flies. It's a very advanced plan that I spent all night on. Are you ready? It starts with Josef walking in, and then... [all laughing] That's not right. And here. Look. Mashallah! You're a genius, bro! Are you kidding me? All that and a double back at the end? One wrong move and Moa's gonna die, bro. - But only if I get scared. - No, that's not the way to go. Yeah. I'll do it for the family. What if we practice, and if we see that it won't work, we'll drop it, of course. But come on, with this move in the battle, ooh, we could actually win this whole thing. Come on, guys. [clucks] [continues clucking] Okay, fine then. Go big or go home! Yeah, that was a dope idea, man. - Dope idea. Good job. - Let's go. [dance-pop song plays] [Moa] Ready? [Mikael] Stand firm or he's gonna face-plant. [dance-pop song continuing] And arch your back. Chin up. [Amalie laughing] - Oh, my God. - Yeah. Like that. But you have to... Yeah, yes! And then... - Perfect. - Yeah? Then it goes like this. Yes. [Mikael] That's right. Then like this. - Bro! - Good luck. Just like that. [cartoonish gunshot] [Mikael, Moa laugh] [dance-pop song continues] [Mikael] Move, move, move! You okay? - Mmm. - [both laugh] Again. Again. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two... [Moa] I was just a little off, bro. Sorry. [Moa] I said sorry, bro. [Josef] All right, grab something to drink, then it's back to work, okay? Everyone ready? Are we taking lunch soon? I have to step out for a bit, but I'll be back in an hour. Again? Why? [Amalie] An old friend lives here and wanted to have lunch. An old friend? Who's that? We're not done practicing. You can't leave. I have to. I have an appointment. - We need everyone here. - I really gotta go. Sorry. [scoffs] I can't believe it. You can't be in the competition if you're not at practice. There's no time. This is the last time, okay? Yeah, it's the last time. All right. Amalie! Stop! Don't leave. Amalie, talk to me. Mikael, I'll be right back. Why can't you tell them you're meeting your mom? I can't tell the others like that. That my mom doesn't want... You know all that stuff has nothing to do with you. You know that. - Amalie, please talk to me. - I have to go. [Vivian] Hi. Come. - Hip-hop, huh? - [classical music playing] Exciting. It's not a genre I'm very familiar with. I, uh, learned it a few years ago from my boyfriend, Mikael. Mmm. That's exciting. It's really only been the last few years I've done hip-hop. I've been mostly doing modern dance lately. You know, you're so incredibly gifted in modern. You always have been. You could've gone as far as you wanted in modern. That solo you performed at school was at a level far above anyone... In school? How do you know about that? Um, I've seen it online. I've seen a lot. [Vivian chuckles] Yeah... I've actually thought about starting all over again. - Have you, then? - Mm-hmm. I really think you should consider it. We have a modern dance program here at our school. It's run by Gabrielle, and she's just a fantastic teacher. I could perhaps get you an audition, if you want. Now? Now, before you head back. Think. Think if you got in here, how incredible it would be. You could live with me for a while. [Alex] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three and four, five, six... [all exclaim] [Josef] Cool, guys. This will be dope. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - I'm fine. - Okay. - So... did the meeting go well? - [door opens, slams] [Amalie] Yeah, sure, but can we talk about it later? [door closes] [delicate instrumental music playing] - [door slams] - [Alex] What's your problem? You leave the second you get the chance, like you don't give a shit about this competition. That's not true at all. I really had to go. That's more important than us? Can't you just talk to me? What's your deal? - There is no deal. - But there obviously is. But I don't understand it, and I don't like it. [door opens] [door slams] [hip-hop music playing] [audio warps, slows down] [Amalie breathing heavily] [high-pitched ringing] [heartbeats echoing] [phone chimes] HI, SWEETHEART.

Hey. Amalie. Nothing's wrong with you. [Amalie breathes shakily] [church bells ringing] Hey, is this okay? Don't worry about it. You look really good. [Vivian] Hi. Come in. [door buzzing] - Hi. - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. - Vivian. - Mikael. I'm Amalie's boyfriend. Nice to meet you. I've had a talk with Gabrielle. - Mmm? - It took some convincing, but I did it. So now you can come by for an audition. Oh. It will have to be tomorrow, because she had to squeeze you into her calendar. - What kind of audition? - Do I have to prepare something? Oh, no, nothing. It's very informal. It's off the record, since you haven't applied. What kind of audition is that? It's for a dance school. A bachelor's degree in modern. In Paris? [Vivian] Yes. In Paris. You should think about it if you want to go to this audition, but it would be good if you could let me know quickly, because I have to tell her yes or no. [Amalie] Thanks. What will you do if you get in? It's an opportunity that won't come around again. It would be amazing if she got in. It's a program that demands discipline and precision and talent and everything I know you have. [Amalie] Hmm. Yeah, she is really good. I know nothing about hip-hop. I just know that it's a relatively new dance style, unlike ballet, which has a long tradition. At least in Europe. Well, uh, why don't you tell me about your dancing now? It's going well. - We practice a lot, and, um... - Exciting. Yeah. But do you have any formal education, or like classes, or is it more of a hobby, or what? I've taken a few courses through a place called Excel. Um, but I've learned most of it myself or from people I hang out with. I see. Excel. Is that a school, or... Yeah, now it is, but it started as a youth initiative in my neighborhood. And by youth initiative, do you mean... Is that for troubled youths, or... Uh, it's actually a place that's open to anyone. What part of town? Alna. Well, I think it's great that the city engages the youth. It's good, right? Especially in those immigrant-dominated areas where... We see it a lot here in Paris. Everything is so chaotic. Yeah, it really leads to a lot of crime in the bad parts of town. [kettle whistling] No, don't... don't get me wrong. I'm not... I'm not talking about you. - [kettle whistling] - I'm just making a point generally. I don't know anything about you or your background. [whistling subsides] We have to go now. We have practice. But we could just send a text to the crew that we'll be a little late. Amalie, come on. Let's go. I'll... come later then. It was nice to meet you. [door closes] [exhales] You don't need to worry about the audition. I can wait outside for you, if you want. I can even come in with you, if you'd like me to do that. [Josef] Five, six, seven, eight! [all grunting] [Josef] That's fire, guys. That's fire. Where you been? We had a deal. Yeah, I'm sorry. Not this time. Huh? You're out of the competition. You're not on time. You leave practices. It's better if we move on without you. We can't be at competitions and wonder if you're gonna show up. Are you kidding? - You can't ditch me like that! - [Alex] You're the one ditching us. [poignant music playing] Mikael. [grunts] Sorry. [door slams] [jazzy cabaret music playing faintly] [in French] Hello. How are you? - Bonjour. - Bonjour. - [in French] I'd like a beer, please. - Are you English? No, I'm Norwegian. [bartender] Ah-ha. Great. - [in English] I had French at school. - Of course you did. - I'm Paul, by the way. - Amalie. [in French] Nice to meet you, Amalie. WHY ARE YOU BEHAVING SO BADLY TOWARDS ME? [phone buzzes] [Mikhail in English] Amalie, what the hell are you talking about? Where are you? - I'm at the bar by the hotel. - At the bar? Can I have a shot, please? As you like, Viking girl. Thank you. [overlapping chatter] [in French] How are you? [in English] Fuck the patriarchy! [crowd whoops, hollers] [in French] Ella, you are the worst! - The worst thing is, they're real. - Of course they're real. [in English] You know, once she pulled out a tampon... in public! That was revolutionary. Period. Amalie. Let me introduce you. Ella. Fabienne. - And Maxine. - Hi. Hi. Okay, what the hell is going on? We are here. If you need us. Hey, come on. What the hell is... What? What the hell are you doing? How am I the bad guy here? I mean, I... Uh, Kael, you are, though. Do you even realize how dumb I felt when I found out, out of nowhere, that you're moving to Paris for 3 years? Where did that come from? What do you mean, how dumb you feel? I have done everything for this competition, and then you just ditch me! You don't ever have my fucking back. You can't talk about me having your back after your mom's. Mikael, you kicked me out of the crew. You're doing modern dance anyway. It's an audition. I'm here for this competition, and you of all people should know how much this means! I have no fucking idea how much this means to you at all. You haven't lifted a finger for this competition! Are you kidding me? I quit my fucking job for this competition! You did what? I didn't get time off, so I just had to quit. That's just crazy. What's crazy? That I gave up my job so I can be with this crew? For the crew, huh? Amalie, listen, there's no way I can support us both. We're so far behind in our rent. Oh, fuck. We're gonna lose our apartment. You didn't even say anything? Right. I totally forgot that your dumb job doesn't pay two shits. You're totally right. It doesn't pay shit. At least I have time to dance. - Because you don't know anything else. - No. You haven't even gotten your high school degree. At least I can dance. Are you saying I can't? You know what? At least I'm for real, okay? Real. - Yeah. - And I'm not? Amalie, if you were for real, you wouldn't be so flaky and all over the fucking place, okay? - Get the fuck out! - Do you know what the worst part is? I met a complete stranger when I met your mom, and you know who that was? It wasn't your mom, it was you. I don't know who you are anymore. Leave! I don't wanna see you anymore. You know what? Fuck this. [door opens] [door slams] [emotional hip-hop song playing] [Mikael breathing shakily] [song stops] [Mikael sobbing] [Josef] Just breathe. I want to show you something. Come.

You know Vivian pretty well then, I assume? Um... No, not really. Well, perhaps you may tell us a little about yourself. Um... I... I have danced modern for many years. But then I started dancing hip-hop. - Hip-hop? - [Amalie] Mm-hmm. Now you want to commit to modern? Yes. It... reappeared in my... I don't know. I'm sorry. Are you not feeling quite well? No, I'm fine, really. Thank you. Okay, whenever you are ready. [phone chimes] I'M AFRAID I CAN'T COME. SOMETHING CAME UP. GOOD LUCK.

[crowd cheering] Good. Because it begins now. So, first, all the crews will dance their showcase. Then the judges will decide which two crews will go to the final in old-school battle. First crew on stage is Lucid Funk. Make some noise. - Isn't Amalie going to watch? - Huh? - Is Amalie coming? - No, she's at her mom's. What? Her mom's? Yeah, I promised not to say anything, okay? Bonjour, mademoiselle. Hi, Amalie. You wanted to speak with me? Yes. I heard that things didn't go as planned yesterday, and you didn't get accepted. But I know you can. It's all about practice. Take private lessons and practice a lot, and you can apply again next semester. No. I don't want to do that. But I don't understand. I gotta go. No, Amalie. Listen to me. Do you know how hard I worked to get you that audition? Yeah. I'm sorry. No! Stop! - Just talk to me! - You didn't tell them I was your daughter! Do you think you'd get an audition if I told them that? Do they even know that you have a daughter? It's not something I feel I can just blurt out. Don't you understand? I've worked here for several years. Then you've had years to tell them that. I just can't come out and say it like that. What is it that you can't say? That you have a daughter? Or that you've abandoned your child? I'm so sorry, Amalie. I don't think I can do this anymore. No. You can't do this. [emotional music playing] And that's fine. Yeah. Um, it was so good to see you. [emcee] Next crew up is Floor Fighters! [crowd cheering] [emcee] Okay, it's time for the next crew. Please, give it up for Raw-nez! Come on. [intense dance music playing] [dance music grows muffled] [dance music resumes normally] [emcee] All right! Whoo! And last, but not least, Illicit. All the way from Norway. Give it up for them. [hip-hop dance song playing] [whoops] [audience clapping rhythmically] [emcee] Whoo! Illicit! Whoo! Illicit! [emcee] What was that? Oh, my God. Okay, that was a nice showcase. So the judges will now decide which crew will go to the finals and battle each other. Okay. So... the first crew who is going to the final is... Raw-nez! And they are, in fact, going against a newcomer. First time in the competition. The second crew going to the final is... Illicit! Whoo! We got through! I knew we would! Sorry! They are... It's my family. [tender music playing] [stirring instrumental music swells] It's in the battle that you get to see the real skills of the dancers. This is their moment to show you their individual style. But it seems to be four against five here. So which one of you will battle twice? - Josef! - [crowd murmurs] That's our fifth member. Can I talk to the judges? [Raw-nez speaking in French] [Josef] She was in the group when we qualified. Can you make an exception? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They said yes. Okay. This is a bit unorthodox, but it seems Illicit has a fifth member. So I'm going to ask you, the audience. Do you want Illicit to let the last member battle? [cheering] Please enter the ring, Amalie from Norway. [Amalie] I'm sorry. - I've been so stupid. - [Josef] Don't worry about it. Welcome back. Let's go, okay? [emcee] Time to dance. DJ, let's go.
