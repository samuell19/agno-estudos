- It was the hottest day of the year as I drove through the winding roads of Topanga Canyon. The sun rose and disappeared over the crest of the towering mountain ridge. - Again? Just take a hot shower, baby. It'll relax you. You okay? - I'm fine. - Same dream? I'm sorry, baby. Hey, I'm here, I'm here. - You didn't know what you were getting yourself into when you asked me to marry you. - I knew exactly what I was getting into, and I love every bit of it. Are you sure you're okay? - I am now. - Good, because that's all I want. - Are you sure that's all you want? - Hey. - Hey. So I been thinking? - What? - This idea of you finishing your father's novel. Think it's a good idea? - Dr. Gooden thinks it'll bring me closure. - He was your father's psychiatrist, and now he's yours. That's not weird? - So now you have a problem with him? - Not really, he digs my photography. - That's the only reason you like him. - You didn't even know him until your dad died. And if he wasn't the executor of your father's will, you still wouldn't know him. That's a conflict of interest. - And I've been seeing him for over a year, Drew. So now you bring this up? - I'm just worried all this is stressing you out. Okay, your father just died. Trying to finish this novel. That's a lot, Zora. - Life is a lot. I barely even knew my father. You never even met him. - We were together a few months before he passed. Okay, you just met my parents a few months ago. - That's because they lived in North Carolina, Drew. My father lived in the same city. Hopefully, he didn't blow all his money. - He handled his business. - My father was a brilliant writer. That's all I'm giving him. I'm, uh, I'm meeting Dr. Gooden later. He said he has some intel on the will. We'll find out if he handled his business or not. - Well, he left me all I need already. - What's that? - You. - You are so smooth. Mm. Let's have a late dinner. - I'll be here. I have a photo shoot, so. - Behave yourself. - What's that supposed to mean? - Mm-hm. - So, same dream? Nothing has changed? You don't notice anything different? - Well, like, uh, last night, I think the corpse mighta been my father's. - Really? - Yeah. - Zora, this may be a breakthrough. - Closure? - Perhaps, yes. - Closure to what? There's nothing open to close. - The conscious mind is far less impactful than the subconscious mind. We aren't as free as we think we are. And we're certainly not in control of what we inherit. - Like schizophrenia? - Yes, like schizophrenia. Now this is information on your father's estate. Your father was very well taken care of by his handlers. There are two things here. First, the house in this photo. That is the first asset to clear probate, so it's all yours. Free and clear. Free and clear. So, maybe this will inspire you to finish his book. - Is there a conflict of interest here? Didn't the publisher pay you to see my father, and now they're paying you to see me? They also want me to finish his book. - Your father requested that I be the executor of his will. He trusted me. The publisher introduced me to your father to help him with his illness. Your father paid me, and it is in his will to pay for your sessions as need be, so no conflict of interest. Now this is your father's file. In his will, he left instructions to give you this envelope on the one-year anniversary of his death. - This is where he died? - It is. How are you feeling? - Nothing. Nada. I don't want to own my father's house. Everything he gives to me turns to cash, post haste. - I understand. I think if you read his file it will help you. - Why? Hm? The sooner I'm done with this, the better off I'll be. Seems like he wanted more to do with me posthumously than he did alive. - Zora, you're drinking? - I'm fine. I have it under control. - It's very important that you are cognizant of your disease. Alcohol does not help. It may trigger psychotic episodes. - I read all the warnings on the sides of my medications. We all have our stressors, Doctor. We all have our own comforts. Ah. Call Drew. - Calling Drew. - Hey, you've reached Drew Long. If this is about a photo shoot, please leave me a message. Others, you know what to do. - I wish you would stop leaving your phone on silent! Oh my God that annoys me! What if I was stranded? I just, uh, I just don't know. I guess I'll see you when I get home. - That's amazing. Nice work, nice work. Yes. That's great, Briana. That's great, I love it. Yes, that's sexy. Great, great job, great job. That's amazing. You look great. Wow, those are amazing. You did great. Okay, change outfits for me. Bathroom's right over there, okay? - I'll just change right here. - What the fuck? What the entire fuck, Drew? - Zora, relax. It's okay, Briana, it's okay. It's just my fiancee. - Just your fiancee? I come home to my house that I pay for, and there's a half-naked bitch in front of my fiance drinking wine. - I should probably go. - It's, no, it's okay. - Probably? - Zora, Zora. What the fuck? Zora, she's a model! They change in front of me all the time. - I bet they do, Drew. The problem is I caught your sorry ass this time. - Zora. - Don't fucking touch me. - Zora, Zora, Zora! What the fuck? ♪ I've come to save you ♪ From yourself ♪ Chariot of women ♪ On this stone island ♪ Come to save you ♪ From that man ♪ Come to save you ♪ From that plan ♪ They made ♪ To please the king ♪ Before they take me ♪ I will watch you ♪ As you go - You must be Zora Matthews. - Hello. - People call me Lorena. - Nice to meet you, Lorena. - And I'm Beatrice, her mother. - Hello, Beatrice. - You are just like your father. - Thank you. I guess. - We should go. I have things for my husband's bar. You are just like your father. - Dr. Gooden. - I got your message about Drew. I'm so sorry. - I had to leave. I'm at my father's house, so please don't tell him. - Listen, stress like this can cause more psychosis. - No. I can't believe how inconsiderate and selfish he is. - Do you have your meds? - Yes, I have my meds. I always have my meds. - You're taking them? - No. - Zora, listen to me. I'm sorry you're going through this, I really am. - Yeah. - But you have to take your meds. - You're right. Yep, you're right. I'll talk to you later. - Please take your meds. - Mm-hm. Hello? - Miss Matthews, I'm sorry. I'm the handyman. - You scared me. - I'm very sorry. - It's okay. I'm Zora, but I guess you already know me. And you are? - Amadi. My mother, Alia, was here too. - She is here or was here? - No no, no no, she's not feeling well. - How'd you know I was coming? - My mother told me. - How'd your mom know I was coming? It was a spur-of-the-moment thing. I'm sorry if I'm staring. You just feel so familiar. - Your father often told my mother that it seemed he lived here before, like in a dream. - Yes. It all feels so familiar. - I was on my way to the master bathroom, plumbing problems. - I can go with you. I haven't seen the house yet. You can give me a tour. Sorry, I'm just jumpy. New place, new start in life. - The house is ready for you, Miss Matthews. I'll let you be. - I'll, I'll go with you. Amadi? Amadi? Ama, Amadi? Excuse me, did you see a guy come in here? - Vodka lime? - Yeah, that's actually my drink of choice. Thank you. How'd you know I was coming? Everyone seems to know I was coming here. It was a spontaneous thing. - I met your father when he arrived here too. I'm Eddie. So, what do you think of our paradise? - Feels like I've died and gone to heaven. This vodka . - So you really think it's heaven? You sure about that? - Feels like I've been here many, many times. That's quite a portrait you have of my father. Did you know him well? - When he wasn't writing or running, he'd come into the bar. - My father was a runner? - He ran all the time. He was a very impressive man. - Mm. I hate that I didn't spend more time with him. He and my mother were estranged, so I didn't see him that often. - He talked about it all the time. He felt very helpless. - My father talked about me? - Yeah. He was very proud of you. He said you were a very good writer. Played the piano, ballerina. - He said that? About me? - He said you were following his footsteps. Like father, like daughter. He wanted you to fall in love, like he did. - When was he in love? What do you want? - Why are you acting like this? - Because I've finally woken up. - Woken up? Zor, what? Where are you? Zor ... - My fiancee. He upsets me. - All things come to a pass. Good, bad. Nothing lasts forever. - I come into my house, and I find him and this slut model. She's half-naked, and he's sipping on wine. So smug, so arrogant. Anyway, fuck him. He's dead to me. Him and his slut models who never pay. I'm building my portfolio. It's all for my portfolio. You know, he's been building his portfolio since I met him. Hey, whatever. To new beginnings. - To new beginnings. - Ah. - I'm sorry, Miss Matthews. I thought you'd be awake. I've still got some work to do on the plumbing. - Stop calling me Miss Matthews. It's okay, Amadi. I stayed up late, it's fine. - Your father was always up early. I thought you'd be out on a morning run like he always was. I'm sorry. - Stop apologizing. - It's just nerves. I apolo ... I mean. - Amadi, my head's a mess. I drank too much. I need to get up anyway and write. - Your father was a writer. - Yes, I know. He was more famous than I am. And a better writer too. But I have time, I suppose. - I never read his books. - Hey, if you see me out walking all around the property, I am not crazy. When I have writer's block or need to think, I walk. You remind me of someone. Do you ever come to Venice Beach? - No, I never left this place. You hungry? - I'll be out in a few minutes. - Sorry, I didn't mean to ... - Stop saying sorry all the time. - I disturbed you. - No, you just walk so lightly I never hear you coming. And I thought I heard something coming from in here. - You know your father, he often heard things. - What? - He called them demons. - Like haunted house demons? - No, your father understood them very well. I'm guessing you will too. - You know a lot about my father. - My mother knew him well. It's a beautiful day for a walk. Your father walked every day. - Amadi. You dropped this the other day. - It's my mother's. - It's beautiful. You should give it back to her. - It's not mine to give. - Everything okay? - No. I was walking, and something tripped me, grabbed me by my foot. - Did you see what it was? - No. It was the weirdest thing. I swear to God, I almost had a heart attack. Maybe zombies. - No zombies in this bar. Your father had visions too. - Visions? - He took his medication. - I know. I'm supposed to take my medication too. - Zora? You didn't come home last night. And I'm worried sick. Where are you? - None of your business. - Zora, you're being so unreasonable right now. - You wanna talk about unreasonable, Drew? - Zora! - To an automatic voice messaging system. - Fuck! - Asshole. - Yeah, like father like daughter. Your father had relationship problems. - My mother said he was a crazed maniac who didn't want anything to do with us. I don't remember him actually leaving. I just remember him not being there. - Perhaps he had demons. - Hm? My mother said bad things about my father. For all I know, she was lying. There's three sides to every story, right? Never heard his. ♪ Redemption glows Now that, that is beautiful. In a sad way. - The singer is sad because she knows her life must end. - It's about suicide? - Your father loved this song. He'd probably think it's ironic now, though. - Why? - His own suicide. - Suicide? He had a heart attack. - No he didn't. - What? How did he die? - In the tub. In your house. - Why would they say he had a heart attack? - I've said too much already. - No, you need to tell me more. - It's late, Zora. Why are you still here? You're coming to destroy our lives, just the way your father did. - When Lorena says we're closed, we're closed. Good night, Zora. - Where are my pills? Amadi! - Zora, are you looking for me? - I, uh, couldn't find my medication. I thought you might have moved it. Then I heard a woman singing, voice. Was that you playing the piano? - There are no women here. No piano. - I heard it, I swear, clear as day. - The demons. - The demons? But it was so beautiful. - Can I help you find your medication? - No, I already found it. Amadi, I have really bad psychotic dreams, and stress brings them on. - I'm always here to talk if you need me. Just think of me as your big brother. Good night, Zora. - Good night. - You have reached the office of Dr. Gooden. If this is an emergency, please call 911. If not, leave me a message. - Hey, it's Zora, I need to talk to you about my father. Now I heard he did not have a heart attack, and I know that's the company line, but I need to know the truth. - Didn't see you this morning. - Yeah, I came to work on some plumbing, but you were asleep with a book on your chest. Figured I'd come back and work later. - Yeah, I was reading my father's novel he never finished. - Was it good? - It's interesting. It's about this place. So a visitor, the protagonist, he comes from out of town and he meets two sisters. And there's a love triangle with another man. - A man in love with two women? - Does that make you feel uncomfortable? - Brings back bad memories. - Hm. Do you hear that? - Zora? Hey, the information is in the file. Your father's file, the one I told you to read. Zora? Zora? - I'm here. - As you know, before your father's death, his last book, "Running With the Bulls," was being published. Now they spent a lotta money marketing it. It's gonna be another bestseller. Now they felt that if it became public, the book would lose millions. - So he did kill himself? - Unfortunately, yes. They paid off the right people to keep it out of the press. - So it was all a lie? - Zora, I'm sorry. I know that this is a lot to take in, but-- - So my father did kill himself. - I shouldn't have said anything. - I don't understand. What happened? - Some things just can't be explained. - Here again, Miss Matthews? - She's upset about her father. - Yes, I'm sure she is. It's time for you to come with me. - Drink up. Lorena doesn't like when things don't go her way. - Amadi? Amadi? Amadi! - No. No! - Miss Matthews, you're up early. - Hm, didn't sleep well. Guess I don't have to tell you that. I am so embarrassed about coming to you yesterday. I'm trying to get it together. - Today is a day of salvation. Tomorrow might be too late. - You're right, Amadi. Today is a new day. Hey, hey! Why didn't you help me? - Help you? Where? - Out on the path. I saw you. You were with a man who looked like my father, and my leg got snagged, again, and I was calling for help. - I haven't left the bar today. You're seeing things, Zora. - No, I'm not. It was you. - Then I must have a twin. - You weren't out on the path? - I haven't been on that path in many, many years. - Eddie, I can't explain the things that I'm seeing. - Some things just can't be explained. - Miss Matthews! Sorry, Miss Matthews, I come to work on the plumbing. - What happened in this house? - What do you mean? - When my father killed himself. - I don't know, Miss Matthews. I only hear the stories my mother tells me. - But you talk as if you were here. It just happened over a year ago. How would you know everything about his everyday routines and nothing about his death? - Because she didn't tell me. - Weren't you the handyman here? - Yes, I'm always the handyman. - Okay. Okay, well, what have you heard from your mother? - I heard that he was wonderful. She loved him very much, as he loved her. - Loved him? And he loved her? - She was to be his wife. - Your mother was engaged to my father? - Yes. - Did they ever get married? - No. - I wish I could talk to your mom. - I need to finish my job. - Dr. Gooden, it's Zora. - Zora, how are you? - I don't know if this is all in my imagination or if I'm having some type of breakdown or in the middle of psychosis. - I know that that information that I gave you about your father would be hard to digest, I understand. - I'm having bad dreams. The other night, I saw a body in the bathtub. And when I was out walking on the path, I saw my father. - I know he's dead, but I ... - Having a dream about your father is not unusual. - But he seemed so real. - Is your father alive? - Of course not. - Then it was not real. It was just a dream. Are there dead bodies in the house? - Of course not. - Then why are you acting as if you saw actual dead bodies? - Because they seemed real. My father seemed real. It all seems real. - Are you taking your meds? - I started again. - Understand your disease, Zora. Tell me about it. - Schizophrenia is a mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally. - And may result in a combination of hallucinations and disorientation. - And behavior that can impair daily functioning. - That's why taking your meds is extremely vital, especially under stressful situations. - You treated my father. Just because someone has schizophrenia doesn't mean they're suicidal, right? - That is exactly right, Zora. In fact, your father was terrified of death. - I need to know what pushed him over the edge. - You need closure. This news about your father is bringing on unnecessary stress. - How do I find closure? - Go to the path where you saw him in your dreams. Visualize him. Feel his presence. And let him know you feel. Let him know how the estrangement made you feel. And then, find forgiveness. That is the key, forgiveness. - Forgive him? - Yes. - I gotta go. - Hey. - Morning. How was your sleep? - I slept, somewhat. Who knows? Amadi, do you have a special someone? - Yes, my mother. - I'm going to make peace with my father today. - Why? - I need to get him out of my head. Been having bad dreams, thinking about him too much. I need to start work. - I understand. - I'm taking a walk on the walking path. Do you wanna come with me? - To make peace with your father? - No, to keep me company. - I'm here to help, Miss Matthews. - Then please, come with me. - Where are you going? Why are you taking Amadi away from the house? - She's going to make peace with her father. - It's your job to work on the house. Is the plumbing fixed? - No. - Lorena? I'm sorry. I just wanted Amadi to keep me company. - You shouldn't talk to us about your father. - Why? - You ask too many questions. Too many. - I just need to find out what happened to him. I need closure. - Your father is dead. What else do you need to know? - I know that. I need to know why he killed himself. - Why do men do what they do? - What is she so angry about? - She lost everything. We know it's not his fault, though. - What's everything? And what's not whose fault? My father's? - The demons. - The demons? That's not an answer, Amadi. You need to stop fixating on the demons. That'll just drive you crazy. This is so peaceful. - Yes, I've never noticed. - You know, that's so true. I need to focus more on what I love about Drew instead of what annoys me. - It's hard to see the forest for the trees. - Up ahead, that's where I first saw my father. Or at least dreamt about him. - I'll wait here for you. - Daddy, I'm hurting. It's the pain we share. It's in our blood. I was so angry with you. I felt so alone. I still do. My mother would say these hurtful things about you, and when she found out I had the same illness as you, she would say the same hurtful things to me. And it upset me, because you were the only one who would understand what I was going through. But you weren't there. Dr. Gooden says I need to find forgiveness for you in order to find closure, and I'm trying. I'm trying. And I believe it'll get better. I only wish you had believed the same. And I am sorry that I wasn't there to help you through your pain. - You okay? You find closure? - What happened? - Zora, you were sleepwalking. - There was a dead woman, and she was after me. - There's no one here except for me. - She was right there. She killed herself in that bathtub. - Zora, it was a bad dream, and I have them too. You just need to rest. - You dream about the dead woman? - Yes. Just rest. - But the woman. - You're safe now, Zora. I'm here. - Bloody Mary. - Now you're speaking my language. - So, you're a writer like your father? - I am. I'm actually working on an unfinished novel he started. - Oh. What's it about? - Two sisters. But the older sister is married and the husband is in love with the younger sister. - I see. - Have you seen Alia? - What do you want with Alia? - Well she was my father's fiancee, I thought. - Lorena says you have made peace with your father. - Yeah, I did. - Lorena says you ask too many questions. - So what? - Curiosity killed the cat, Zora. - I need to go write. - Hey. - Hey, I was thinking about taking a walk. Wanna come along? - Uh, I need to show you something. - Where'd you find this? - It fell out of my father's book. Is that your mother? - Yes, why? - I need to know about your mother. I need to talk to her. - No, that's impossible. - But your mother was engaged to my father. She might know why he killed himself. - There's some things that cannot be explained. - His book is about two sisters in a love triangle. - What's that story have to do with my mother? - Did your mother have a sister? - Yes. - In the book, the older sister's husband loves the younger sister, but a visitor comes to town and falls in love with the younger sister, and she's with him. - What's this story have to do with my mother? - The husband becomes so enraged that he kills the younger sister. - It's a story. It's make-believe. - But the older sister kills herself, and the book stops. Listen, I need to know if this book is based on a true story. We have to help. - No, he shouldn't be here. - He's being attacked. - It's not your place. You shouldn't be here! - What happened? - I'm here to protect you. - No! - You okay? - That woman, she was here. The woman who died in this house. - Zora, please just sit and relax. - I can't relax. That woman wants me dead, and she is going to kill me. - Zora, it was only a dream. - What happened outside? - When? - Last night. - Outside this house? - We were talking about your mother's photograph at the bar. - No, Zora. - Yes, yes, there was a man on the path, and he was being attacked and I tried to save him, and I turned him over, and it was my father and it looked like he was dead. - Zora, it was a dream. - We didn't talk outside? - No. - We didn't see a man being attacked? - No. - I am going fucking crazy. Dr. Gooden, this is Zora, I'm in real trouble here. - Were you able to find closure? - Yes, I went to the place where I saw him in my dreams. - Did you tell him how you felt? - I told him everything, but the dreams are still happening. As a matter of fact, they're getting worse. I keep seeing this woman coming after me. I think she's trying to kill me. - Do you know who this woman is? - It's my father's fiancee. Did you know he was engaged to a woman here? - Yes, that's all in the file that I gave you. Did you not read the file yet? Zora, I don't wanna add more episodes to your psychosis, but, Zora-- - Dr. Gooden, I am trying to manage here, okay. And I always do. I just need to talk to Alia, and she'll help me put together the pieces. - Zora, you have to listen to me. Alia-- - I'll call you back. - Hey, feeling better? - Did Alia work at the bar? - Yes. - Is that were she is now? - Yes, but I told you, she's sick. - I need to go there right now. Come with me. Amadi, I need to talk to your mother about my father. If I can do that, I can stop these bad dreams. - I can't leave my job. - What do you mean you can't leave? You work for me, or my father's estate, don't you? - I can't leave my job again. - Where's Eddie? - No one's here but me. What can I get you? - Hello. It's me, Zora. You know me. - Mm, no, I don't. - When I first arrived at my father's house, I met you with Lorena. - Drink, it'll calm your nerves. - I need to ask you about your daughter. - I don't have any daughters, honey. - Alia, your daughter. - Drink, it'll calm your nerves, sweetie. What are you doing with that? - I found it. Is Alia your daughter? - That's right, honey. Drink up. The demons are thirsty. - I need to know about my father's suicide. - This was my daughter. - Yes, I met you with her when I came to my father's house, remember? - She's dead now. - What? When? I just saw her. - She died long ago. - I get it. You're fucking with me. Look, I just wanna talk to Alia. Amadi said she was here. - Why? - To ask her about my father. - He caused my sorrow. - My father caused your sorrow? - He never should have come here. - What did he do? I don't get it. - He changed our world. - Can I just talk to Alia, please? - Alia and Lorena are dead. Alia and Lorena are dead. - Where's Beatrice? - Beatrice? Beatrice died of a broken heart. - Broken heart? - You were on the path, you fell down. I helped you. - That was last night. - How many drinks have you had? Or maybe you need another one. - No, she was just here. I saw Beatrice. - When was this? - Just now. 10 minutes ago. - Beatrice died a long time ago, Zora. - No, no no, she was here, and she told me Lorena's dead. - Dead? - Yes, and, and, Alia is dead too. - Lorena? Zora thinks you're dead. - Do I look dead to you, Zora? - Drew? You're real. - Of course I'm real, baby. - I've been having the most horrible dreams. - I know you've been having bad dreams. That's why I came. - You came here? - Yes, to take care of you. I even brought you fresh flowers this morning. - What are you doing here? How did you know? - Amadi said you fell and knocked yourself out. He nursed you back to health. - She's having horrible dreams. - Dr. Gooden said I should come and make sure you were taking your meds. He said you've been hallucinating. - You met Amadi? - Yeah. - I was at the bar. I saw Beatrice. - No, you never went to the bar, Miss Matthews. You been here in bed. - You fell, baby. Okay, it was your dreams. It was your psychosis. Your father's home is, is beautiful. It's amazing. You know what we should do? We should go on a walk. It'll make you feel better, okay? Why don't you come meet me out on the path? - I saw Beatrice. - You never left here. - Beatrice told me that Lorena was dead, and then Eddie told me that Beatrice was dead. - It's okay now, Miss Matthews. - No, no, Beatrice is dead. - It's not true. Come. Come see. There's Lorena. She's not dead, no one's dead. You're sick. You should go join your fiance. - Amadi. - Your fiance is worried about you. I wish my husband loved me the way your fiance loves you. - I'm glad he came. I'm a very lucky woman. - Yes, no more falling down. No more bad dreams. Amadi tells me that Zora has nightmares, every night. - Yeah. Now I'll take care of her. - We were all worried about her. We don't want her to ruin our lives the way her father did. - The way my father did? - I have to go to my husband now. - Thank you for helping her. - Mm-hm. - I really fell? - Yeah. - And I never went to see Beatrice? - No. - I'm really going crazy here. - That's why I came. I'm sorry, baby. Dr. Gooden was worried about you. - Just Dr. Gooden? - I was too. - Did he tell you my father killed himself, and that he was engaged to another woman, Amadi's mother? - Yeah, he told me everything. It musta been difficult for you. - Yeah, horrible dreams. In one dream, I'm walking on this path, and then something suddenly pulls me down. And then, in another dream, I see a dead body in the bathtub, a woman. And then she starts chasing me like some type of zombie fighter. - Those dreams are gonna end. - Promise? - I promise. - Oh, don't tell me. This is Drew? Zora talks about you all the time. She is very much in love with you. You're one lucky man. One woman, one man, that's what it's supposed to be. Right? - You still in love with me? - Yes. - Vodka martini? How did you know? - Zora tells me everything. - Yeah, but I didn't tell you ... - To us. - Beautiful necklace. But it's not yours to wear. Is it? - I found it on Zora's desk. I liked it. Thought it might add some flair. Don't you think? Should I not have? - He gave that necklace to Alia. - Who gave that necklace to Alia? - When he found out she was pregnant. - Such a beautiful present. Don't you think so, Eddie? - I think we should go. - You just got here. - Drew's tired. It's been a long day. - What am I missing? - I don't know. Everybody gets all fucking weird about that necklace. Did you see his face when he saw it? - Yeah, it was definitely freaking me out. - I think my father's novel has information about all of this, and it's what drove him mad. And I think that's why he killed himself. - I don't think you should finish his book. - Why? - Because it's making you mad. I'm worried about you. - I was having a drink with Beatrice earlier, and she told me that Lorena and Alia are dead. And then five minutes later, Eddie calls Lorena from the back and she's standing right there. You saw her? - I did, but who's Beatrice? - Beatrice is Lorena's mother. I have a feeling she's Alia's mother too. I don't know. I just, I don't know anything anymore. - That doesn't make any sense, Zora. None of it makes any sense. - Do you wanna come home with me? Just forget all this ever happened, forget this place and just start all over. - Yes, baby, of course. - Good. Do you mind if I talk to Amadi? - Yeah, sure. - Amadi, we're going home, and I just wanted to say thank you. - Why's he wearing the necklace? - He's just quirky like that. He found it on my desk. - You should give it back to my mother. - How? - Zora, do you have a minute? - Dr. Gooden, hi. Drew's here. I feel amazing. We're on our way back. - Thank God. You need to get outta that house. It's not good for you. - We are. What's going on? - I've been reading over your father's files and thinking about what you told me. I'm gonna send you some photos. Let me know when you got 'em. - Okay. - Did you get the photos? - Let me put you on speaker. - Now that photo is your father and his fiancee. - I know. - Is that the woman that you've been seeing in your dreams? - Yes. Yes, she's dead in my dreams. - Okay. Sending you another. Let me know when you got it. Did you get the photos? - Yeah. - Now that is Alia, Lorena and her husband, Eddie. - I've met Lorena and Eddie. - Zora, that's not possible. - I see them every day. - And you are positive that you've not read the file? Zora, Zora, listen to me. Many years ago, Alia was found dead in your father's house. And on that same day-- - This is Zora. Leave a message. - Drew, thank God. What? - Zora. You don't need to remember that . - No! - Why did he have to come here? - Amadi! - What's happening with my baby? - Amadi, Amadi, where is Drew? Where'd he go? - I told you not to ask questions. - I didn't know. It wasn't his fault. He couldn't have known. - We coulda been happy, all of us. It didn't have to change. - It was your father's fault. - Then you made him mad. He took my baby. - The usual. - Eddie, please, you have to help me. Have you seen Drew? - Drew? - My fiance, Drew. - You want me to help you? - Lorena and Alia are trying to kill me. Help me. Help me please. - I really liked your father, Zora. Until he betrayed me! - Drew? Drew? Drew! Drew! Drew! Drew? - Your turn. - Hello, Zora. You know you've been here before, don't you? - I don't fucking care, Drew. You're a lowdown, dirty, sneaky piece of shit, and I will never ever ever forgive you. - You know what your father's book is about, and you know why he didn't finish it. You knew Lorena and Alia were my daughters and they were both in love with Eddie. - But that all changed when Thomas Morgan Matthews showed up. - I met your father, when he arrived here too. - A visitor, he comes from outta town and he meets two sisters, and there's a love triangle with another man. - It was love at first sight. - And everything was fine, until Eddie became jealous. And when he found out that Alia was pregnant ... - The husband becomes so enraged that he kills the younger sister. - After Lorena found out that Eddie killed Alia, she couldn't take the pain. - Yes, yes, there was a man on the path and he was being attacked, and I tried to save him, and I turned him over and it was my father and it looked like he was dead. - After Eddie attacked your father on the path, he came back to the crime scene to find that Lorena had discovered what he had done and took her own life. That's when Eddie shot himself. - I think my father's novel has information about all of this, and it's what drove him mad. And I think that's why he killed himself. - He caused my sorrow. - It was your father's fault. - Why did he have to come here? - He blamed himself, and that's why he ... - Open your eyes, Zora. - It didn't happen like that. - When you went inside the house, you already knew. - No. No, I met Amadi, and then I met Eddie at his bar, and I tried to save everyone. - There is no Amadi. There never was! He was never born. Eddie killed his mother because she was pregnant by your father. - No. - This never happened, Zora. This right here, isn't happening now. You're dying, Zora. - No. - You're dying right now. - My dearest, sweet Zora. God has gifted me with but one child, and that child is you. Over the many years that I have been running from the demons, I have learned one incontrovertible truth. And that is to never question the will of God, but to wake up every morning and give thanks, Zora. I wish I had understood that. I am so terribly sorry for the pain that I have caused you. But know that I have loved you with every fiber of my being. I want you to take this cross, okay. And I want you to wear it. As a reminder that you are not alone. That you're being protected from the other side. And don't follow in my footsteps, baby. Because you can do better. Because you are better. And just remember, the demons are in your head, but God lives in your heart. So open your heart and live, Zora, knowing that I will always be here to protect you. With eternal love, Daddy. - Zora! Zora! Zora! Zora, baby, I'm right here. I'm right here. Hey, hey. - It's okay. Daddy told me it'll be okay. - It's gonna be okay, baby. I'm right here, okay? I'm right here, I'm not going anywhere.
