- Yes sir, I understand. I understand your order did not arrive. I owe you a box of Fazzle Glue and I'm... Yes, yes sir you, ah... you have a wonderful Fazzle Glue day. Alright, bye bye. - I'm gonna have to fire you, Edwin. Do you have that password list I was asking you about? Uh... uh, yeah. Yes sir, here. I'm not sure I understand. - Well, what's not to understand? - I mean, I -- - We're downsizing. Is this all of them? - Yes sir, every one. - Alright here is a box for all of your stuff. - But I've been here 21 years, sir. - I know, time flies doesn't it? - I was eligible for a pension in four months. - Like I said, really sorry. So get all of your things together. Betty will have your last check ready. - Mr. Clark! Yes, Edwin? - Who's gonna do my job? I Mean, there's a lot of things going on, I've got... Of course, your youngest is qualified he can do that job. - Well look, who knows? We may hire you back once things pick up. - Yeah would you? That'd be great because y'know I think the world of Fazzle Glue and I'll be here all the time, I'll work even more harder and -- - Look. I didn't mean "more harder", I meant "harder". You know what I mean. Okay. Alright I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna go ahead and clean out my stuff here. - Eat it all up, Bernice, so you'll be big just like me! - You're home? I must have lost track of time. Hey. - What's in the box? - Just stuff from my work. - What did they do, fire you? Oh, well, well good. You don't need them. All they ever did was take advantage of you. - What happened? - Mr. Clark says they're downsizing, it's just a temporary thing. - Downsizing, what a bunch of baloney. - Well, what about your pension? - For crying out loud, you're not getting your pension either? - Daddy! Hi, honey. - What's in the box? - Just stuff from Daddy's work. Hey I got something for ya. - Another stupid mug. - That's the latest edition Fazzle Glue mug, huh? Cool. Look, Mr. Clark said he'll hire me back just as soon as things pick up. It's just temporary. - What'd he say? - He says it temporary, dad. - Temporary, right. - What's going on? - Your dad got fired. - Dad! - What? You got fired, she asked. What happened to your hair? - I decided it was time for a change. - It looks like a wig. - Coming from someone who wears a Halloween costume everyday. - Liberty Bell. - Dad what are you eating? - Chinese food. - That's been in the fridge for over a week! - Week smeek. It's got so much MSG in it to last for over a year! - Bad day? - Yeah, a little. I just need to do my exercises more often. So, are you doin' homework? - Yeah, well it's the only way I'll ever get out of here, so. - Hey! - I'm going to put all my crayons in my new mug. Okay, Yellow... hm. Blue, Black... what is this color? - Oh let me see it, pumpkin. - That's all you have to do, mom, is stop it from shaking and everything will be alright. See? Kinda, little thing there. Sorry about that. - Your wife's appointment was at 12. - Uh no, it's uh, no. It was one o'clock, I'm quite sure. - No it was 12. You'll have to reschedule. - Uh no its uh, no. It was one o'clock, I'm quite sure. - No it was 12. - It's okay. We can come back another time. - Look, I've got the card right there, it says one o'clock. - No, you must have changed this. - I didn't change that. - We'll come back another day, it's alright. - No, Jen I got this. Look, I didn't change this. - I'm sorry, you'll have to reschedule. I'm not leaving here until I see Dr. White today. Your not seeing him today. Dr. White's office, how may I assist you? Hold on one moment. - You must be the doctor. - Yes, I must be. - Look, our family has just been through a major crisis and your incompetent staff messed up our appointment. - You need to hold on there, missy. Back off, lady. - It's okay, it's okay. - As I was saying, my mother needs to see you today. Okay, okay. - Put that down, put it down. - So, your condition seems to be getting worse with time. Okay, arms up please. And down, okay. And are you still taking the same medications? - Well my husbands insurance was changed back in April? - Yeah, the medications were costing more than our mortgage payment. - Hold on one second. Sarah would you come in here one moment, please? Okay now insurance companies and I, we haven't been getting along very well these days. I want you to put Mrs. Durshman on the list for new Parkinson's medication please. - Yes, doctor. - Okay, thank you. Okay, there is a new drug. It has not been released yet and pharmaceutical companies are offering it for free, to selected patients. - Wow are you serious doctor? That's fantastic. - It's done very well in clinical studies. I really think this is gonna make you feel a lot better, improve your function. - That's wonderful, thank you. - Yes doctor, thank you so much, that's great. - Oh, can I say grace? Of course you can. - Thank you God, for the food we are about to eat. Oh, Amen. - And God, could you please help Edwin here find another job? God knows he could use the help. - I can hear you, dad, I'm right here. - What? It never hurts to ask, you never know. - You're preaching, not asking. Dad. Dad! - What? - You're grunting. - I am not a grunt. - I didn't say you were a grunt I said you were making grunting noises. - Now, look. You make me get food all over Grandma's urn. - I don't know why you insist on eating with that thing. - You know she goes wherever I go. - Grandpa even takes her with him to go potty. - Right you are, young lady. Wherever I go your Grandmother goes. - Okay that is not Grandma, that is Grandma's ashes. - You take that back. Where is she going? - I'm going back to my bedroom to eat dinner where there is some peace and quiet. - I'll get it. - Would you let me buy a new one or at least unplug it while we eat? - I got it. It just sticks once in a while, it'll be fine! Dad, why can't we just take her and give her a proper burial like normal people would? - We will when I can remember where the tree. - What tree? - Oh it's, um, the tree where Grandma and Grandpa carved their names in. - They carved their names in a tree? - Mm-hm! It's what people did back then. - Don't do that now or you'll get arrested for destroying a tree. - It doesn't destroy the tree. - It doesn't help it. - "My dearest William, it's been only three weeks, "yet it feels like an eternity. "I pray your job is not too much for you "and cannot wait for you to return and come back to me. "Three years is such a long time for us to be apart. "I'm afraid I have some bad news, "my father has been offered a job overseas. "I'm not sure if he's gonna take the job "but if he does I fear we will be even further apart. "I don't know how I will get through this. "I regret having to share this bad news "but I feel you must know. "The only thing I can do is pray. "Pray that we will be together again. "I must now conclude as my eyes have welled with tears, "with a heavy heart, your true love, Beth." - Oh, very nice. - Good morning, girls. And to you. - Do you like my face I made? - Best face ever. - Can you go wake up your sister, please? - Sure! Don't mind if I do. You know, I've been thinking. We need to catch up on all the repairs around this place. See, like that! I finally have time to do things like fix the kitchen table while I'm waiting for them to call me back to work. Observe! See what I mean? I am number one. Fix kitchen table. - Did you wake your sister? - Mm-hm! - Dad, you feeling okay? - I'm fine, it's alright. - Well, where is she? - I'll get her. Liberty! Liberty! Hey, Lib? Hey, come on, honey, your mom made pancakes. - I'm not hungry. - Are you having an attack? - Yeah. - Focus on my hand, Jen. Focus. Keep focusing. Good, good. - Hey, don't worry about that. I'm gonna get that fixed today. - Great, now he's a plumber? Awesome way to start my vacation. - What was that? - I think you should call a plumber, dad. - Oh, okay. - I'll be out in a minute, okay? Where is she? - She's in the bathroom. Oh, well here she is, everybody. Okay, ready? Oh my gosh! - What are you doing? - I'm -- - No no, stop wiping. Don't wash her down the drain! - I got it. Dad. - Yeah? - I think we should take Grandma's urn to the tree and bury her ashes there. - Well, it's a great idea but Grandpa doesn't remember exactly where the tree is anymore. Do you, dad? - I can't remember much of anything anymore. - Wait, I have Grandma and Grandpa's letters. There has to be something about the tree in there. - What letters? - The ones Grandma gave to me before she died. - She gave you letters? I don't remember any letters. - Can you get 'em? - Yeah, I have a box of them. - Do you remember anything about letters? - No. - The tree has to be mentioned in here somewhere. - Do you remember these at all, dad? - No. Could you, please? - "My dearest William, "I'm so happy to inform you that my father "turned down the offer to move us overseas. "I prayed every night and God must have heard me "because we are now staying here at home." - She must have prayed awful hard and God answered her prayers. If they had have moved, then that would have been the end of us. Please, can you go on? - "I go the tree once a week, I know it sounds silly "but it makes me feel like I am with you." - Dad, that's the tree, do you remember? - "It's a bit of a ride on my bicycle to Two River "but when I am there I can feel your presence. "I think I will write my letters "to you when I'm here at the tree." - I remember that tree. It's about an hours walk from her house. It only seemed like five minutes when I was with you Grandmother. - Yeah, but the tree is in Two River. - Do you even know where that is? - Not exactly, but it can't be very far from Grandpa's old house, remember, dad? - I'm sure we can find it. - Well okay, that's what we should do. We should get in the car and drive out to Two River and bury your Grandma. - I couldn't ride that long in the car. - We can take the RV. I'm off work, the kids are on break. We can make a mini vacation out of it. - I need my flashlight! My sleeping bag! My blanket! My teddy bear! I just need everything, we're going to the tree! We're going to the tree. We're going to the tree. - Come on! Haha! Haha! Come on, Earnest, you have to be real quiet! - Do you wanna to read another letter, sweetie? - This one Grandpa wrote. "My Darling Beth, "I can't believe how long the days and nights have become. "I realized there was a chance that "we would never hold each other again and I almost gave up. "But what kind of man would I be if I didn't do everything "humanly possible to be by your side 'til the day I die? "I am so pleased that you are not moving. "You really have no idea what that would have done to me. "Another month has ended and we are that much "closer to being in each others arms. "I have a busy day tomorrow and the night is late. "I look forward to your next precious letter. "You are forever in my dreams. "Your true love, Will." - That was really nice, dad. What ever happened to that guy? - Honey! - No, really, I wanna hear this. What ever happened to that young man? - He grew up. - What do you mean "he grew up"? - He was a kid, then life hits you in the keister. But you, you have it easy. - What, who has it easy? - You do. - Oh, I have it easy? - You most certainly do. - Well, you know what dad? I don't think I do have it easy. In fact, I think I have it harder. - You know what your problem is? - No, what's my problem? - You care more about that stupid Glue company than you do your own wonderful daughters. - Alright now, I've heard enough. First of all, Fazzle Glue is not stupid. And secondly, they named me employee of the year 21 years, straight. That's an accomplishment, dad! - I'm done talking to you. - Well, you know what? You know what's ridiculous? I'll tell you what's ridiculous. You carrying around that stupid urn all the time. We can't take you anywhere with that thing. Was that Ernest? Are you kidding me? Oh my gosh! - We can't do this trip with Ernest. We should turn around. - We can't go back now, we've gone like 200 miles. I don't know why you even let her have a goat in the first place! - Oh, that was just as much your idea! - Originally, I said no goat. Where is she going now? Jen, sit down. - Jen, focus on my hand. - I'm calling 911. Focus. Yeah, that's good, focus. 911, what's your emergency? Oh, hi. No, um. No, we're okay. We're fine now thanks, sorry, sorry. - Why do you always have to do what I do? I can't believe you brought Ernest. - He gets lonely. - Alright. Jessie! Goats don't eat jellybeans. Alright. - Hey, I think I may have found something. This one is from Grandma. "My dearest William, "as I was making my way here today "I noticed some men surveying Jack's property. "Word around town is that they are putting "in a new highway not too far from here." - We had to go through Jack's property to get to that tree. But I'm having trouble remembering the highway. I'm gonna go check on Ernest. - Okay, pumpkin. - It's all coming back to me now. I know exactly where it is! - You guys, Ernest is gone! - He's down there. - I'll go get him. - I'm coming with. - Mom says you're doing well at school. - Yup. - You thought about what you might wanna do after that? - Yup. Well, I'm sorry it's so rough for you. You sound like Grandpa. You're right, I do sound just like him. - Sorry about your job. I know that place really meant a lot to you. - Well, hopefully they'll call soon. - What did you do there anyway? - You never knew what I did for work? - No. - I was in charge of all the product orders. - And you did this for how long? - 21 years and eight months. - That's longer than I've been on this planet! - Yup, and you know what? When you were born they gave me the whole week off. - Wow, that must have been real nice of them. - That was real nice of them! You know, I don't know what I did to make you so miserable. Honestly, what did I do? - You didn't do anything, that's the point. All you ever do is talk about that stupid company! - I do talk about that place a lot. I was never really good at anything. I struggled in school, I didn't have a lot of friends. And then they gave me all the products and all the orders and finally I was good at something, you know? - And then they ripped the rug out from under you. - Sounds like he's getting further away. - We have to go find him. - I'll wait here in case he comes back. Go ahead. - Okay let's go find him. - Where is this goat? - Ernest! - Ernest. - Ernest! - Oh hey, looks like your mom and Jessie are looking too. Hey! - Daddy! - Hey pumpkin, no luck, huh? - No, we have to find him. - Don't worry, we'll find him. - Have you guys heard him lately? - No, not for a while. - Look! It's Ernest's poop! This is definitely Ernest's! He can't be far. - Ew, Jessie that's disgusting. - Yeah, it sure does look like Ernest's poop, but let's put it back on the ground, okay? - Ernest! - Ernest! Ernest! - Alright, go with Mommy. Come on. - No luck, huh? - No. We're gonna have to stay here for the night. I'm gonna go ahead and get the camper locked up. Ernest! Ernest! - Everything okay? - Yeah I was just getting the camper set for the night. - We have to find Ernest. Jessie will be crushed if we don't. - I know. Let's get some sleep. - It's all my fault. - No dad, it's not your fault. - If I hadn't -- - Really dad, it's okay. - We'll get up in the morning and Ernest will be right at that door waiting to be fed, like he always does. - I'm sure you're right. - Come here, give me your hands. Dear Lord, once we embark on this journey to finally put our beloved Grandmother, mother and bride to rest, please be with us in days ahead. And please Lord, bring Ernest back safely. Amen. - Amen. - Did you hear Ernest? - Yeah, I did. - Eddie, I saw a bob cat a little earlier. - I know, me too. - We're just gonna have to wait 'til in the morning. Have a little faith, he'll come back. - Okay. - Ernest? - Ernest! - What are you doing? You're scaring him off! Grab the rope. Good job! - Hey, how about another letter? - "My dearest Will, "I have enclosed a photograph of myself." - Wait, she sent you a picture? - "It's been a warm summer, I've taken a part time job "to save up for when you come home from your break. "See you soon, your true love, Beth." - I would not wanna leave a pretty girl like that all alone. - Well I can't just marry her without a house for her to live in. I'm saving up every penny. - To each his own. - Is that the photo? Wow, dad! You must have been a happy man! Bring back any memories? - What's wrong? - I trusted him. - Trusted who? - He's getting his memory back. - I used to read my letter to someone I thought was my friend. - You shared these letters with your friend? - Yes, I did. He didn't have anyone. I guess I felt sorry for him. - Why on earth would you share that with anyone? - Be nice! - I stopped once I saw how he looked at her in these photos. - Sorry dad, I didn't mean to upset you. - I don't wanna hear any more of those letters. - Seven-eights. - You know, I've never been to Tucson. It's not exactly Tucson, it's further south. - Hey um, I think you should get out from under there. This piece of wood, it doesn't look too safe. I'm almost done. Hey, is the 1516's in there? So, is that where she lives? - That's where we'll live. I need the clamp. Clamp! Ah, yeah. Will? Will, Will! Help! We almost lost you there. - He's your brother? - A friend. He's gonna be okay, right? - He's in a coma and he's suffered severe head trauma. I don't wanna alarm you but I think the best thing you can do is say a prayer for him. I've seen God do some wonderful things. Sam's going into surgery. I need to tell you there's a chance that he may not make it. "My dearest Will, "I know you are very busy but I have written two letters "and have yet to receive a response. "I hope that you are well. "Please call me on Thursday of next week "at eight o'clock PM. "Forever yours, Beth." - Waiting for a phone call? - Uh yeah, a friend needs help with homework. - Homework? It's summer. - Uh, she's taking a summer class. - Don't forget to turn out the light when you're done, okay? - Okay, I won't. - Beth, why are you sleeping in here, honey? - I must have fallen asleep. - Well it's almost 11 o'clock, come on, let's get to bed. - Where are we? - Something's wrong with the camper. I'm looking for a place to stop, a gas station or something. - But we're in the middle of nowhere. - Oh, great! It's overheated. - Is it something you can fix? - I'm sure I can figure it out. Ow! Have to let it cool down first. You're not getting away this time! What do you think of that, huh? Alright, here is your food. Alright, you stick around here. It's an amazing view. I'm proud of you, you know. - What do you mean? - I was never very good in school. So I made Fazzle Glue my life's mission. - It's just a transition, you'll find something better. So what's wrong with the RV? - Ah, the radiator hose has a leak. - Anything? - Yeah, surprisingly I have one bar. - Are you gonna call for help? - Yep. - Are those the keys? - Yep. - That's weird, I didn't hear them hit the bottom. - No, neither did I. Oh hey, I see 'em! I think I could reach that. - Oh, you're close, you're an inch away. You dropped them. - Yep. I dropped them. - Now are you gonna call for help? - Well, I guess so. Only, now I have no bars. - Great! - Great! - What are they doing out there? - Maybe they're just taking a break. - Daddy! - Oh! - What are you guys doing? - Dad dropped the keys in that well. - Cool! - No, not cool, pumpkin. Daddy was careless. - That's one way of putting it. - Are you taking a break? - Daddy dropped the keys down that old well out there. - You dropped the keys to the camper down that well? - Yes dad, I did. - Well, what are you gonna do? - I'm gonna get the keys. - I'm just curious, how does someone drop keys down a well? - Don't need it right now, dad. Let it video, drop my phone down the well, see right where the keys are. - Can't we just call someone? - Mom's phone doesn't have any signal either. - How far off the main highway are we? - Honey, can you check your phone for a signal? - Nothing. Look, I got this okay? - And we're recording. Here we go. Okay, that's it hit the bottom. - So what are you gonna do once you see the keys down there? - Please, dad, I'm trying to concentrate, okay? - Ew, gotta be snakes down there. - Cool. - Alright that's enough, do you think? Let's see what we got. - Oh, there they are! - Yeah. - At the bottom of the well. - And not in his pocket where they're supposed to be. - Let's climb down there, dad. - Hey, grab me a hanger from the camper. - Well what do you think you're gonna do now? - I'm gonna make a hook out of the hanger, slip it through the rope, drop it down there to the bottom and grab the keys. - That'll never work. - Hello! - Be careful, pumpkin. - So are you going to explain to me exactly how you put us in this situation? - The keys fell out of my pocket, okay? - How did the keys fall out of your pocket? - They just did. - In all the years I've worn trousers I've never had keys just fly out of my pocket. Maybe a coin or two, but never keys! - They were at the top of my pocket and they just pulled out and fell. - Normal people usually put something important like car keys deep inside their pocket, not on top. - Well maybe I'm not normal. - That's an understatement. - Oh, now that's teamwork, high five! Just me, okay. Okay. Lower it down. There at the bottom. - You'll never see anything down there, it's pitch black! - Dad, please! - Okay, go on and do your own thing. - I hear 'em! - Yeah, me too. - There it is again, you got 'em! - Yeah, I think so. Woohoo. - Told you that'd never work. - I'm just gonna have to try again. I'm going back to the camper. - There's something I wanted to tell you. They're looking for guys to work on a ranch. I can make enough money to put a nice down-payment on a house for us. - A house for us? - Yeah. But the ranch is in New Mexico. - New Mexico? How long will you be gone? - That depends, the longer I contract for, the more money I can make per day. - Is it for a couple of months? - No, no it's not for a couple of months. It's for three years. - Three years? - I know it... - That's a long time, Will. Three years. - I'll be able to come home when the seasons break. Beth, what kind of man would I be if I can't make a life for us? - It looks like you've made up your mind. - When I come back, Beth. Then we'll get married. You do wanna get married? - Yes, I want that more than anything. - Well then, why are -- - Three years? - Three years is really not that long. - Oh, I have one bar! Who should I call? Oh, I know, I'll search for a towing company. - Yeah, good idea. I've lost the signal again! - Daddy you can lower me down there and I can grab the keys! - We are not lowering you down there. You know what, pumpkin? Let's go back to the camper. - But I wanna go down in the well! - That's just not gonna happen, okay? - You know, she hardly weighs anything. I can lower her down really slowly. She grabs the keys and we're gone. - We are not lowering her down there! - Please, Mom! - What possibly could happen? - She falls, that's what happens! - I won't fall, Mom! - No, I've got a great idea. Hold on, I'll be right back. - Maybe I should get Grandpa. - Everything will be okay, Mom. - Okay pumpkin, are you ready for our super secret mission? - Yes! - Okay, come on over here. - Have you lost your mind? - Oh, someone doesn't look too thrilled about your little plan. - Okay, ready? Put your foot in there. - Have you lost your mind? - How are you doing down there, pumpkin? I guess she's okay. - Are you at the bottom? - Yes! - Do you see the keys? - I got them! - Looks like we got company. - Okay, I'm going to need you to be really quiet for a minute, okay? Shh quiet, super secret mission. - Okay! Shh, super secret mission. - Howdy, folks. - Hi. - So uh, what are you all doing out here? - Uh, we just had a little engine trouble, you know? - Hm, engine troubles, huh? - Yeah, it over-heated a bit. - Did you need me to call you a tow truck? We can get one out here right away. - No, no, no. Are you sure? It's no trouble. - No, we're good now. I mean, it's under control. We're just letting it cool down. - Okay, if you need anything, give us a call. You have a safe trip. - Okay, bye bye now. - You still got hold of that rope? Of course I do. - Okay, are you ready to come up? - She's gonna be heavier coming up. We don't want you to drop her. - That was fun, can we do it again? That was so much fun. I was on the rope and you, I could hear you yelling "grab the keys in the dirt!" It was so much fun! - Mm-hm, yeah. - There's your problem, the hose got a leak in it. Give me a screwdriver and a sharp knife. - I got this, dad. - Stop with that "I got this." Get the screwdriver and knife. - How's it going out there? - We'll get it figured out. - Dad, that was so much fun, can we do it again? - I don't think so. Why don't you finish your sandwich? - I want to thank you for taking the time out to, uh. - Oh, I know it was important to you, dad, to come out here. - Eddie, do you know why I'm so rough on you? - No, why is that? - You're not close to the Lord. - Well, that's gonna solve all my problems, huh? - That's the problem with your generation. - Oh, my generation? - That's right, you expect all the problems to be fixed right now. That's not the way it works! - Would you give it a rest with the holy roller stuff? Man, it's getting old. I'm sorry that was uncalled for. - Okay, go ahead and start her up. Alright. Knew it all the time. Alright, lets go find that tree. - Yes! - Okay, it's the next exit. - Okay guys, we're almost there! Wait, I thought you said the next right? This is a dead end. - This can't be the right road. - Look, the maps says it's the road, see? - Stupid goat. - Maybe there's a way around? - I don't see another way around. This is supposed to be the road that leads to Two River. - Thank you, Jessie. - Why aren't we going to the tree to bury Grandma? - Because the road's blocked, pumpkin. - I think he wants to be alone. - Do you remember that old tree? Yes, I remember the tree. - I want you to put my ashes there. - Don't talk like that, you're gonna be fine. - We both know I don't have very long. I left something there for you. - What are you talking about? - It's nothing really, it's just a young girl who wrote a letter to her true love. I'm glad we were married. We had a wonderful life together. - Yes we did. - I'm going to close my eyes for a moment. - Are you just gonna leave him out there all night? - No. I'll go get him. Come on, you can't sit here all night. Come on. - Eddie, take me to that church. - Let's dance. - Dance? Beth, there's no music. So what? Come on. You see, we don't need music. - Beth? - Dad? - Where did she go? - She's gone, dad. - Eddie? It's a miracle you're here. I've never told you this story. I was working toward getting a home for your mother so we could get married and start a family. Somebody almost made all that not happen. Paul had his own plan in mind. - Is this about that boy? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Honey, do you really think I don't know whats going on? I was once young too and in love with your father. So i understand. - I write letters to him almost everyday but suddenly he doesn't write me back. - Sometimes boys can be pretty dumb. They can do stupid things. - Maybe he's met someone over there. - Well maybe he has but I would lay odds she's nowhere near as beautiful and as smart as you. Oh honey, God will work this all out for you. "My dearest Will, "I have asked that you call so I can rest my nerves. "Where are you? "I'm lost without you. "Please send me something. "Even if it means goodbye." - I'm sorry, what did you say your name was? - My name is Paul. I've come a long way to have a word with Beth. It's about Will, it's kinda important. Beth. - Do you know this young man? - It's okay, dad. - Could I talk to you? - Sure. - You uh, you might wanna sit down. - So how do you know Will? - We worked together. - You said your name is Paul, right? - Yes, yeah. - You traveled all this way? You must have something important to say to me. - Beth. - He's dead, isn't he? - No, no, no. He's not dead, he's, uh. - Are you going to tell me? - Yeah, yeah I'm gonna tell you. Will met someone and now they're gonna get married. - I'm sorry, did you say he was getting married? - Yes. - You came all this way to tell me he was getting married? - I found this letter that you sent to him. He had thrown it in the garbage. I asked him if he was gonna tell you and he just said "She'll get over it." I mean, I felt so bad for you. I saw the address on the envelope and... well here I am. - I don't believe it, I need to go see him. - No, no you don't wanna do that. - I need to see this for myself. I need to meet this girl. - He's not there anymore. - Where did he go? - I don't know where they went. Beth. He's gone, Beth. He's gone. And she believed him. They began dating. His family had money. The only reason he was working there was because he got into some trouble and his father wanted to punish him. Thought it would humble him. Turn him into a stand-up man. I finally woke up, recovered and was able to travel back home. - Beth! It's me, I'm home. - What are you doing here? - What do you mean, "what am I doing here"? - I'm home. - What are you talking about? - What are you doing here? I said! What are you doing here, Paul? - Look, they said you weren't gonna make it. - So you thought you could just take my girl? - What's he talking about, Paul? Paul told me you got married. - Married? - Go home, Paul. - So you never got married? - No. - Well then why didn't you answer my letters? - I was in an accident, I couldn't. A tractor fell on me, Beth. I've been in the hospital the whole time. - Andy. - Your mother and I saw each other every single day after that. - What ever happened to Paul? - I don't know and nor do I care to know. - Oh sorry, we just walked in. - Grandpa came here to talk to God! - Well that's alright, my church is your church. - And we're gonna go bury Grandma at the tree at at Two River. - Two river? There's a place I haven't heard mentioned in years. Ever since the freeway went through, Two River has become just a memory around here. - So you know where the tree is? - Well, I can tell you how to get to Two River, but they have a lot of trees. - We just need to know where to go. - I'll find the tree once we get there. - Dad, are you okay? - I'm fine, I'm fine. There it is. I remember that bench. - Look, there's your names! - Oh, the tree's all dead now. Do you have the urn? - I don't have it, I thought you had it. - I must have left it at the barricade. - Don't worry dad, I'll get it. Here, why don't you sit down? Let's clear the bench, can we? - Are you okay? Can we get you anything, dad? - I'm fine now. - You guys wait here, I'm gonna go run and get the urn. - Let's give Grandpa some space. "My dearest Willam, "I have finally let go, I have been told "that you've found another. "But deep in my heart I know we will be together again. "Your true love, Beth." - Mom. Grandpa found another letter. - Grandpa! - Just a little cat nap, honey. - Dad, you're killing me here. - Hey, pumpkin. Hey. - Where's your flight suit? - Dad, that's for little kids. Okay. You know what Ernest needs? - What? - I think Ernest needs a friend. Grandpa! What do you think? - Mom, your hand! It's not shaking. - She's right. That medication is really working. Yeah, it's really helped. So who's gonna say grace? - Um, I'd like to say it. Dear God, thank you for bringing us this meal and thank you for allowing us to lay our mother and Grandmother to rest. - And thank you for bringing our family closer. - And thank you for giving us the strength to complete our journey. - Amen. Amen. - Hello? Oh hi, Walt. It's Walt from Zebra Glue. Yeah I haven't heard from you in a long time. - He owns your dad's old company's competition. - Well sure, yeah they let me go last week. Well yeah, this Monday? Well, yeah! Of course I remember where your office is. Okay, yes, thank you sir. Alright, yeah, okay. Thanks, bye. That was Walt from Zebra Glue. He offered me a job. Zebra Glue? I use that all the time. Now that's a real company. - What, he just offered you a job, just like that? - Yeah, he said they wanted someone with real loyalty. They've wanted me for a long time but they'd never think I'd leave Fazzle Glue. That's amazing! - I know. The only problem is the pay... is double what I got before! - So does that mean I get a phone? - Yes, as soon as you get all A's. Okay, let's eat!
