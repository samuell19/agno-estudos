I sent her "The Top 20Dating Ice-breakers." Top twenty? I thoughtit was supposed to be top ten. I know, right? Like, if there'sthat much ice to break maybe you shouldn't beon a date. Hey, come here. The Cyan Wintersports 820. Are you getting thatfor your trip? 'I wish, it's a little steep' on an assistant's budget but a girl can dream. Well, you could get the 620. All the bells and whistlesfor half the price. Hm, that's not a bad idea. Maybe we hit up the storebefore the party? If we ever get out of here. I really wishyou were coming snowboarding with me this weekend. Yeah, I've learned my lesson on making plans around here. Every time I book something Diane sends meanother assignment. - Hm, don't I know it.- 'Hm.' Do you think she's read it yet? Probably. There's onlyone way to find out. Diane, if now's not a good time, I-- Now is always a good timefor my favorite writer. What do we have? Oh, "Top 20Dating Ice-Breakers." I love the headline. Yeah, thank you for that. You shouldn't feel underminedbecause I write the headlines 'in advance, Cara.It gives the magazine--' A consistent voice? See, you were listening. - I like it.- Oh. But you don't love it? I want to, uh, but it needsa bit more pizazz. You know, maybe a, a cautionarytale of a date gone wrong. Don't underestimate the valueof your own personal-- - Dating horror stories?- Perspective. You're out therein the singles' world. So, I mean, let's see that. Actually, I startedseeing someone recently. - Very recently.- Perfect. So I'm sureyou have some material. Oh, I would, but the thing is it's going pretty well and I was thinking, with the New Year's maybe I could try to keep my personal life a little bit-- Personal? Um, as I recall, you asked to be on the relationship desk. But, I mean, if it's too much we can always put you backon the beauty desk. No! Uh, no. I-I will make it better. Wait, Cara, make it better next year. It's New Year's. You guysshould be out having fun. - Really?- Yeah, really. Don't come hometill the sun's up. And then, you know, startthinking about that re-write. Happy New Year! - Okay, how about this one?- Amazing. Amazing because it's amazingor amazing 'cause we spent too longbuying your snowboard? - Oh, well, can't it be both?- Ugh. We're never gonna make itacross town before midnight. Well, then, why don't we goto Jesse's rooftop party? He livesjust a couple blocks away. I told you, I cannot go to Jesse's. We've only been datingfor three weeks. It's too soon. You know, the old Carawould've gone in a heartbeat. Exactly, but the new Cara is careful aware that holiday partiesare synonymous with romantic expectations. You know, that soundslike one of your articles. - Yeah.- Oh, shoot! Hey. 'What's this?' - Nothing.- 'Nothing?' - Mm-mm.- It's from Berkeley. It's the grad program increative writing you applied to. - Maybe you got in.- Ah, don't jinx it. - Well, don't you wanna open it?- Oh, no, no, no. - I can't. You do it.- Okay. 'Well, it looks likeyou're gonna be' bringing in the new yearwith a bang. - Oh!- You got in! Oh, I'm so happy for you. I'm kinda dying to tell Jesse. Well, then, let's hit upthat rooftop party. Let's go. Let's go. I just can't believe I got in. Well, I can. I edited the first 50 pages of that mystery you sent in and I'm still dyingto read the rest of it. Well, you might get your wish because if I accept, then Ihave to show up February first with the other 150. What do you mean, if? Well, it's a big decision.I'd have to quit the magazine. Ooh, it's almost midnight. Ten, nine, eight seven, six five, four, three.. Ooh, that's him over there. Ooh, super cute. On second thought, not so cute. ♪ Should old acquaintancebe forgot ♪ ♪ And never brought to mind? ♪ ♪ Should old acquaintancebe forgot.. ♪ So what's the rule here? You read five pages, you gotta buy it? Well, if that's the case,I'm on the hook for half the mystery section. Well, you're in your happy place. Meh. Today I'd call itmy glumly distracted place. Come on, it's not that bad. It's New Year's Day, you gota couple of new mysteries your favorite scone, a cup of coffee with a sustainable storyattached to it. And a best friendwho thinks it's never too soon to bounce backfrom a heartbreak. Okay, look, so Jesse showed you, sooner than normal that he was the wrong guyfor you. You should be focusingon the good things going on in your life right now like getting into grad school. I don't know, Meg, the moreI think about grad school the more I thinkit's not a good idea. What? Oh, man.How did we wind up here? What's wrong with this place? We just finished our runin record time. I was gonna treat youto a wheatgrass shot. A, that's not a treat. B, next time take me somewhere that isn't also a book store. I mean, last timewe came in here I had to pry you out of there with the Jaws of Life. Ah, what do you want from me? This is my happy place. Two wheatgrass shots, please. Now that I think about it wheatgrassisn't your worst idea. I mean, we are gonna be boarding the sheer face of a glacierin the next few days. Yeah, I wanted to talk to youabout that. Any chance I can take a passon this weekend? No, no, no. No, Ben. I already took time offfrom the hospital and Dr. Sean is no longeraccepting cancellations. Alright, it's just,I'm under a lot of pressure to stay out the public eyeright now. What are you gonna do, stay at home and mope? I don't mope. I brood. Then brood on a snowboard. Besides, you're doing itfor the charity. Yeah, you're right.Of course, yeah. For the kids. Bottoms up. Anyway, you don't have to worryabout the public eye. Clara Lake Resort is not exactly a scene, if you know what I mean. You mean, there's no chanceof running into anyone we know? No one we know, no one you'd want to know. All I'm saying is you shouldn'tlet this Jesse stuff cloud your judgment. You should weigh out the pros, not only the cons. I have been, and grad schoolfeels like a huge risk. I'm just supposed to walk awayfrom a job most writers would dream about? Most writers don't understand the job requirements of workingthe relationship desk. It's a lot of pressure, this expectation that you should be datingall the time. It does take up a lot of energy. Energy you needto finish your novel. Maybe I should take a step back. - Yeah.- Get a little perspective. - Right?- Put dating on the back-burner. Exactly. Wait, what? Well, just till I figurethis other stuff out. Ooh, Diane is not gonna like that. Oh, well, Diane won't have a choice. - Oh. Sorry.- Excuse me. 'We're jogging back.' Ah, when did you becomemy trainer? Today. 'So, uh, that's itfor Beauty And Fitness.' - What's left?- Just Relationships. Right, Cara, loved the ice-breaker changes which is good because I want youon this new dating app, stat. Dating app? Um, well, see.. The problem is, I can't actually go on dates. I've given it upas a New Year's resolution. So you're a relationshipwriter who's sworn off dating? I guess yeah, that sums it up. Cara, this is a story.I already have a headline. The dating plan's perfectfor New Year's. We'll put it on the site, reprint in February. - How did we do Diet Diary?- Uh, in three parts. One, Friday.One, Saturday. One, Sunday. So, when you said Friday, did you mean today Friday? Is there another FridayI should know about? - No.- Look, Cara. If these segmentsare as good as I predict you'll come back on Mondayto a new title. Editor. 'Thanks, guys. That's it.' Hey, what's going on? I thought your cousinwas picking you up for lunch. She's got the flu. Trip's canceled. No! Can you get your money back? Well, I'm on holdwith the resort right now but it doesn't look promising. Shoot.Meg, you should go anyway. I mean, who knowswhen you'll get another chance. I know I would. Why don't you? Ah, please, I would love to go, but I can't. - With this whole dating--- 'You would love to go where?' Oh, Megan's snowboarding trip. Her cousin canceled, and I can't just.. - Go? Why not?- Oh, I have so much to do. I have three articles, one due today. There's no pointgoing on a dating cleanse if you're gonna hide outin the office. I mean, it's aboutchallenging yourself. A ski resortwould be pretty perfect. 'I can't believe you're here.' A girls' trip to Clara Lake justlike when we were in college. Right, the good old days, when our biggest problem was choosing a fondue flavor. Mm, fondue. Yeah, something tells mewe haven't seen the last of that fondue bar. Mm-mm. 'You've been peckingat that thing' for the last couple of hours. Are you actually gettingwork done? One Dating Cleanse down, two to go. The first one is called "From Dating DisasterTo The Dating Cleanse." - Thank you, Jesse.- That's very mature of you. Yeah, well, I have to startthinking objectively if I want to be an editor. If being an editoris what you really want. Ugh. I don't knowwhat I want anymore. Uh, grad schoolis such a question mark but jumpingfrom writer to editor just seems likea, a real thing, you know? Well, maybe this tripwill offer you some perspective. And maybe gettingsome real writing time will provide clarity. You brought your manuscript? I've to read it againif I want to finish it. - It's been months.- Cara Reneau, mystery writer. - Ooh.- Sounds good. - I like it.- And you know what they say. You can be anybody you wantto be when you're on vacation. Hey, that's our exit! 'Fondue bar, here we come!' 'Yes!' I can't waitto carve an edge. Hey. 'Thank you.' Hey, so the bad news is our chalet isn't ready yet but the good news isthere's still enough daylight that we can get a few runs in. Okay, we just haveto rent my board. - Mm-hmm. Let's do it.- Mm-hmm. - Coat and everything.- Jacket? - You just nailed it.- Right? Oh, yeah. Looks like I'm lateto the rental party. - 'Is that all they have left?'- 'Huh.' No way. The Cyan 920? - Is that even in stores yet?- No, it's a custom. I can't believethey're renting it out. I'm gonna go getthe lift tickets, you grab that boardbefore somebody else does. Mm-hmm. Ooh, sorry. Yes. Well, I seem to have my eyeson the same board as you. Oh, you seem to havea pretty firm grip on it, too. Uh, it's yours. As long as you know it's notthe right board for you. Oh, yeah? And why is that? The top should fall somewherebetween your nose and you chin but here it isall the way up to your... eyes. Unless you havean advanced rider who wants to floatat fast speeds over powder. But I am curious.Why are you so dead-set on it? I've used this model before. I guess you could say, I like to know what I'm getting. Oh, that's pretty cautiousfor somebody about to go careeningdown a mountain. - Careening?- Mm, tumbling, falling. With a boot size like yours.. ...you're gonna getsome overhang. You really wantthat kind of drag? No, I suppose I don't, Miss..What did you say your name was? I didn't. Enjoy the board. Oh, my quads were not readyfor those moguls. Are you sure this one's ours? It's a little farfrom the lodge. I know, right? Almost like whoever picked itwas trying to avoid their boss' cell phone calls. - Oh, yeah!- Wow! This is so nice. - Nice job.- Oh. Thanks. - Ooh, snacks.- Mm-hmm. Now we're talkin'. It's not addressed to us. You think they forgot to clean? Yeah, really. Wait a second. This is still cold.Somebody's here. Hey, what are you doing here? - What are you doing here?- 'Well, uh..' Wait. You know each other? 'Okay, there must besome kind of mistake.' Uh, yes, there is.This man is in our chalet. No, no, no.I already checked in. And as you can see, I rented half a chalet. Well, that may be the casefor you but we went through the troubleof booking-- Half a chalet. - I'm calling the hotel.- This has to be fixed. Uh, hello, yeah,I'd like to see if I could book a chalet for two ladies who-- Oh, you have nothing? You know, it doesn't have to be a chalet. It could be a hotel a cabin, broom closet. Nothing? Thanks for checking. Well, I was planningon opening this tomorrow 'but maybe we shouldcrack it open now' 'and get to know one another.' - Would you like a glass, Mr..- Just Ben. I'm not muchof a fancy wine guy, but, sure. I'll give it a shot.But my buddy will be stoked. - He loves a good Cabernet.- Wait. Buddy? There's more than one of you? Hey, Ben, uh, how about a heads up next timewe're gonna have guests. Yeah, slight issuewith the fine print. Look, these ladiesare gonna be in the other room. Hey, look, you know what? It's gonna be fine. I called the lodge, butthe resort's fully booked up. - I sort of--- Messed up. It's all good.The more, the merrier. I mean, it's a huge bummer consideringour guys' weekend and all. Cool! - Is that Cabernet?- It sure is. - You want a glass?- 'Sure.' - I'm Megan, by the way.- Sean. - Cara.- Thanks. I don't know about you guys, but wine just doesn't taste right without chocolate. Ooh, I'll take one. Thank you. Really good. Let's seewhat you guys got here. Mm, artisanal brie 'Royal Fig Jelly..' Champagne? You guysmust be VIPs around here. Ooh, these are cute.Wine charms. - Oh, not the wine charms.- What's wrong with wine charms? How else would we knowwhose wine is whose? Hm, makes you wonder how peoplekept track of their wine for thousands of yearsbefore they were around. Okay. There is a really nice deckout front. Maybe we should.. Yes, let's justtake this party outside. What, outside? We just got warm. I mean, that's whatthe firepit's for. Wine charm? - Thanks.- Mm, enjoy. - Uh..- 'Don't give up, Ben.' I'm sensing you're on your wayto a solid B-plus fire. Thanks, man. Not much you can dowith wet wood. But, hey, if you wanna goand get some dryer logs.. Nah, you got this. Besides, this weekend,I'm avoiding doing anything that could be considered work. I'm not talking about work,I'm not working out I'm not even gonna work iton the dance floor, you know? If you knewhow many variations of that I heard on the way up, you wouldn't be laughing either. Well, I'm downwith the sentiment. 'I don't even wanna knowwhat you guys do.' - Right on.- On that note.. I'm gonna power this thing down, lock it in the glove box. I am so therewith you... in spirit. Hey, uh, where's Cara? She got caught upin that word we can't mention 'but we should take pityon her.' She got slammed this weekend. Yes. Alright. - 'Oh, sorry, man.'- Come on! I guess I'll go findsome more matches. Unless, of course, you'd like to. No, no, no, man.Go to town, okay? There are probably somein the, uh, kitchen. - Oh, good idea. Thanks.- 'Yeah.' Like I was saying, vacation is all about staying off the grid. - Mm.- Yeah. You know, there's some instantlight logs in the closet. You have very little faithin me. I've known youfor all of five minutes. - How much faith should I have?- Hey. I gave you my snowboard.That has to be worth something. - Your snowboard?- Ah, f-figure of speech. - Mm.- But I gotta hand it to you. You got a great eye. See this mark? It means only 40 of thesewere ever made. Which meansonly 39 are left in the world. Which means you lucked out. Funny you didn't mention thatin the pro-shop. I didn't want to add fuelto the fire. What fire? You seemed pretty dead-seton getting it. You should see meat a sample sale. You know what? You look really familiar. What part of Seattledo you work in? 'Hey, hey, you missed out on our pact.' This is a work-free zone. - No work talk.- Won't argue with that. Then shut your laptopand come join us. It's leisure time. Why does no one understandthis is leisure? Hm, lots of words, super close together. Looks like work. Look closer, it's a novel. If you're a novelist workingon a novel, it's still work. Unless I'm a novelistwho's avoiding her real work which I have to work on later. You realize just how many times you said the word "work?" I'm sorry, I'm not used to wordsbeing off limits. It kind of makes it hard to getto know each other, doesn't it? Well, getting to know youis overrated. People give you signsthat tell you who they are. Like, you know, typing when someone's talking. Mm. Robes, check. Towels, check. It is timefor some R and R. Ca.. - Have you started a diary?- Nope. That thing you said about beinganyone you wanna be on vacation if I'm even consideringbeing a mystery writer then I've gotto start taking notes treat the whole worldlike one big mystery. Like that couple over there. They haven't talkedfor five whole minutes. What's the story there? Maybe.. Maybe they're tired from skiing. Well, what about Ben and Sean's$500 gift basket? Oh, well, actually, detective I have been doingsome of my own digging and there is a story there. Turns out.. ...the hotel sent it to them. Come on, let's go. Spa time. Ooh, spa time. Here it goes. My last moments of relaxationfor the evening. What do you mean? Wi-Fi caught up with mein the locker room. What, did Diane ask youto do something? Yeah, but it's nothing. There's a new positionin the office and she wants meto post a job description. But you're on vacation. Yeah, but I can do itin my sleep. In fact, watch,I'll do it right now. Operations managerwanted for women's magazine. Must work wellwith colorful personalities. Mm, that's a nice wayof putting it. Have organized work habitsand in-depth knowledge of our business needs. Send. You know, that sounds like somebody who already works there. - What, me?- Mm-hmm. 'Come on, Diane's looking for someone' with management experience. I'm just her assistant. Exactly. You manage Diane. I manage her salads. And her editorial schedules, photo shoots, interviews. Huh. I never really looked at itthat way. You know, in all honesty,I've never really looked at it.. ...at all. I'm so focused on Diane, my ownstuff slips through the cracks. That's not true.I mean, you planned this trip. Yeah, look how wellthat's going. Oh, who cares about the chalet? We can still haveour girls' trip. - Mm.- Really. Wha.. Look, I'm just gonnatake a deep breath mind my own business and pretendthose guys aren't even there. Fair enough. Why didn't the hotel give usour own gift basket? Zen-ing out over here, Cara. Zen-ing out. - It felt so good.- It felt good, right? Shh. Are you really shushing usat 9 p.m.? Yeah, he had a rough dayof not working. - He needs his beauty sleep.- Yeah. That's why there's these thingscalled bedrooms. The chair is much more comfy. Plus, I got the blanket, I got my cocoa I got my Agatha Christie. "And Then There Were None." Yeah.I found it on the bookshelf. I got 50 pages left, but I've narrowed it down to either Veraor Judge Wargrave. - Don't ruin it.- Oh, I would never. Although, I would sayboth of your guesses are wrong. Not hearing you. I am curious why you twoaren't down at karaoke. It's ladies' night. Which begs a question.Why aren't you there? Well, sort of taking a breakfrom that whole world. - From the karaoke world?- No, from the dating world. I guess you can call ita cleanse. Hey, if it works for you, more power to you. Yeah, actually, it is working for me. It's helping me focuson more important things like.. Are you expecting someone? Maybe. Hey, man, thanks.That's awesome. 'Mm-hmm.' You know, when I saidthere were only 39 of these 'left in the world?' Now there's only 37. - Do you hear that?- What? It's the first chairliftof the day. Let's get out there. I'm surprisedyou have so much energy. - Weren't you working all night?- Good thing I was. 'Cause I finishedmy second Dating Cleanse post and ten pages of my novel. Mm, look at you. It must bethe fresh mountain air. Well, Diane sent meanother headline. - What was it?- "Cleanse Complications. How To Say NoTo Toxic Temptations." - Temptation?- Yeah, well.. It was all hypothetical. Not exactlytemptation mountain up here. - Oh, except for these.- Mm-hmm. I'm so looking forwardto the fresh mountain powder. It snowed, like, nine incheslast night. Ah, and not a soulhas touched it. We'll be the first twoout there. - Well, maybe not the first two.- Hm. Hm. Uh, excuse me.How did he get up there? - The lifts just started.- That guy? Someone took him up therein the snow-grooming machine. Now do you agreethere's something up with our chalet-mates? Yeah. I thinkhe slipped the groomer a 20. Okay, fine, but what about the mysterious late-night snowboard delivery? - Mm.- Mm-hmm. Maybe he's an online shopper. Come on, let's get to the summit before you getthe server backstory. It all began with a Danish. Dude, you should'vecome with me, man. How often do you get to be thefirst person on the mountain? About as oftenas I get to sleep in. - It's 8 a.m.- Dude. 8 a.m. is, like, noonfor a surgeon. Okay, time for latte number two. I'm gonna geta couple of runs in and, uh, don't forgetour spa thing later. I take my vacation timevery seriously. Oh, before I forget she came by the chalet earlierlooking for you. Mr. Livingston. It's so greatto finally meet you in person. Please. Ben.You must be Jennifer. We are so gratefulfor everything you've done for Camp Snow. I just wanted to ask youabout the benefit tonight. Would you prefer to makeyour speech before or-- I'm sorry, speech? Uh, there must be some mistake. I'm donating to the event. - I'm-I'm not attending.- Are you sure? There's gonna be a dance tonightand the caterers-- No, I'm sure it's fantastic but I gotta stayout of the public eye right now. - So, did the boards arrive?- Yes. The driver hit some traffic, but he should be here soon. Okay, well, can you just do me a favor and shoot me a textwhen they do? Sure. Well, at leastwe'll get to the top before the crowd gets.. And the plot thickens. 'Maybe he's offering hera ride on the groomer.' Ah.. Come on. So, what's the plan? Board, fondue, hot tub? As long as fondue'son the docket, I'm happy. Hey, do you think I canget some writing time in? Yeah, be my guest. The more you work on your novel, the more likely it is you'll say yes for grad school. Uh, don't get ahead of yourself. Oh. Hi, Diane. No, it's never too earlyto call. Listen, that job postingyou put up.. - 'Is it okay?'- Better than okay. We got eight applicants already but we're in such a rushand so overwhelmed. Could you possibly screen them? Uh, you mean, like, go over their resumes? 'No, their resumesall look the same to me.' I need you to screen themon the phone narrow them down to three. You saw my schedule next week. 'I can't possibly meet' 'with eight people myself.' But you don't mean, like, today, right? Don't worry. One of the internsscheduled the calls already. Actually, I better get off, the first one's gonna be calling you in, like, I don't know, a minute. - What? But..- Megan. What would I do without you? Ha! I can't believe this. She wants meto screen the candidates today. - Like, right now.- Oh. You can't let herruin your weekend. Well, I'm not gonnalet her ruin yours. Why don't you head on to the topand I'll meet up with you later? Hi, thanks so muchfor doing this on the weekend. I hope you weren't too busy. Good morning. You're up early. I was hoping to getthe first run-in of the day but some guy beat me to it. Ah, you know what they say. All's fairin love and snowboarding. I don't think they say that. Look, I kinda feel likewe got off on the wrong foot. Did we? I was hopingfor a weekend with my buddy maybe get somesolitary reflection time in. Mm, I know the feeling. What I'm trying to say is, what if we just start fresh? Like, what if we just metright here in this chairlift? Oh, what, like a properintroduction? No signs? You may mock meabout the whole sign thing but it's a 100 % foolproof. For example, last night, with the wine charms you chose the pineapple, the least friendly fruit. Least friendly or best defended? Best defendedor overly defensive? I find that peoplehave all sorts of defenses. - Like, deflection.- Deflection? Are you implyingI have something to hide? Well, if we're goingon your wine-charm theory I'd say you do.You chose the sunglasses. The classic disguise.What could that mean? - Trees or moguls?- Why do you ask? Honestly, so I can do the opposite. Came back early to read, did ya? - A little static over there?- Yeah. Under control. Thanks. Uh, saw some hair bandsin the bathroom. Yeah, they'd be great if only there was a helmetthat fit over them. 'Did you finish reading? You still think it's Vera?' Yeah, actually, I moved on to another book. Wait. You read my manuscript? Uh..It was open on the coffee table. - You had no right to read this.- But I couldn't put it down. I had to get to the end.It's really good. Well, it's just somethingI threw together. I actually came backto work on it get somesolitary reflection time in. I get it. Dying to read more. You know what, you seem a little too content to be inside, reading all the time. Okay, let's just say I haven'tbeen super social lately. Just laying low, no crazy nights out. Something's not adding up. You really are a mystery writer. Mm, you claim to be laying low but... it's not what I'm seeing. Okay, what I'm seeing is you'rebeing a little overly curious. I'm telling you, sunglasses. And you graduatedfrom Portland State? Oh. That's a year after me. Cool. Huh, I havethe same major as you. Well, that's great. I, um.. We're gonna be setting upin-person interviews for next week... and.. You know what? I will send youall the details in an email. Okay, thanks. Bye. How am I supposedto sound authoritative when the next timeI see the candidates I'll be offering themtheir choice of tea or coffee? I mean, what exactly am I doing here? Management? Well, then why am I not upfor the job? Because they asked for it. Oh, another one. 'Hi, thanks so much.' Wait. I walk out, so you walk in? Must be one of your signs. You sure you don't wantany help? The menu in therecan get pretty complicated. Mm, it's called Beer & Brats. I think I can handle iton my own. Well, sure, anyone can order a brat but garnishing it, that takes serious know-how. Great, so the interviewwill be 9:30 a.m. at Mallory Magazine. Yeah. Great. See you then. Ah, finally, last one. I'm sorry. I didn't see you. - Megan.- Sean. - Are you okay?- I'm okay. But I think there'ssomething wrong with my wrist. Mm. Okay, maybe you were right. That wasa perfectly-dressed brat. - But, phew.- But? Somebody's gonna have to take medown the mountain in a sled. Yeah, I know that condiment barpretty well. My brother and I usedto have topping contests there when I was a kid. I'm guessing you won? We'd usually get chased out before a winnercould be declared. I actually wasn't sureI'd be allowed back into there. But... being up hereon a day like today.. ...just makes me wish everyonecould have this, you know? It makes you feel like thingscould be just... perfect again. Today was pretty perfect. That's why I was wondering why you were holed up readingmost of the day. Oh, it's this new authorI found. She's becomingone of my favorites. 'Besides, I need a little restbefore I take on' 'the pipe where it all started.' Where it all started? Yeah, I learned to snowboard up here. I landed my first 3600n that pipe... when I was nine. I thought no one was watching. And then I just hear clapping. I turn around, and my dad'sstanding there watching. All the older kidswere laughing. I thought I was gonna die. Restaurants, birthdays, you name it. He still thinks he's onthe sidelines at my soccer game. I thinkmy dad would've liked him. - Oh, I'm sorry, I--- No, no, it's okay. Being up here, I can almost hear it. This place, this sport it was his passion. We used to havethe best weekends up here. And I haven't hadthat kind of fun in a long time. The weekend's not over yet. Day job? Won't leave me alone. Might not matter soon. I've beenaccepted to grad school. - Congratulations.- Well, thank you. But it doesn't mean I'm going. Yeah. This year,I'm trying to be more cautious. You know, think things through, evaluate risk. I mean, don't get me wrong, my job is no picnic. Insane deadlines, phone calls all weekend but I don't know, it's one of these jobs that most people would kill for. Yeah, I kinda haveone of those, too. Okay, so you know, it's notthat easy to walk away from. Wait. What, what's so greatabout your job? Uh, I workfor a snowboarding company. - Ah, right.- Uh-huh. - It's all making sense now.- Mm-hmm. Well, that should be fun. In theory. You know what you said earlierabout your helmet? It'd be easy enough to puta groove here for a ponytail. Oh, did I give youa business idea? It's the kind of thing we usedto jump on, but not anymore. Innovation's takena back seat to image. Still, it can't hurtto pitch it to them. You know, for someone who'sso cautious with her own life you dole outa lot of risky advice. I guess you like to livevicariously. You do realizewe just agreed on something? I'll let it slide this time but don't let it happen again. Ah, shoot! I forgotI gotta be somewhere, so I'm.. - I'll catch you later.- Yeah. You sure you don't minddoing this? I know you came hereto get away from work. After I mowed you down, the least I could do is save youa trip to the hospital. Plus.. ...I wasn't gonna leave youwith that EMT. You know, I got nervous whenhe opened that X-ray manual. - How does this feel?- Ah, tight. It's only gonna get worseif it swells so, uh, keep it elevated, and no devices. Wait, no. No, no, no. I got a call in ten minutes. I.. No, I-I don't thinkyou understood what I just said. No devices. No typing, no texting, no calling. - For how long?- Two to three days. - Hah. No. No, that can't work.- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. No. No, no, that can't work.You don't know my boss. I can't tell her that.She'll never listen to me. But maybeshe'll listen to a doctor. Hi, Diane, I meant to text you back but my mittenskept getting in the way. It's a littlesnowboarding humor. 'Don't get too distracted, Cara.' You know, there's a lotof eyeballs on this third post. It needs to bea real showstopper, right? Yeah, sure, maybe something about how much you can get donewhile you're not dating. I meant somethingpeople would wanna read. Um, tell you what,I'll work on some headlines.. - 'Um, okay.'- Well, have fun. 'But, remember, I needthat third post by midnight.' - 'Don't be late.'- You got it. Huh. Hey, if you're looking foryour friend, she's downstairs. - Who, my friend?- Yeah, petite, dark hair. - Purple jacket.- Oh, you mean Megan? Yeah, yeah.She's in the infirmary. - Wha..- 'It's all good.' She banged upher wrist or something. Oh, no. Uh.. - It's this way? Thank you.- Yeah, right down there. - You got a visitor.- Hey. Hey, are you okay? Could be worse. It's just a minor fractureand a sprain. She'll recover a lot fasterwithout this. - You sprain your wrist?- Might even save her weekend. Hey, my phone! How are you feeling? Well, other than this,I'm hungry. Ben, you've reallyoutdone yourself. I was expectingfive or six boards not fifteen of them. Signed by Travis Bretz? Yeah, well, you can thank Travisfor that one. He couldn't have signed themif you hadn't donated them. Giving every kidthe chance to go to camp no matterhow little they come from well, that's reallyimportant to me. Well, if all goes well tonight even more kidswill be able to attend. It's a good guest list. I can't help but thinkif these people saw your level of involvement they may follow your lead. Look, any other timeI would be front and center but I-I mean, I just can't do any public appearancesright now. Okay, but there's not gonna beany press tonight just my own photographer.It's gonna be really low key. It's just so rare that one nightof somebody's time can mean so muchto so many kids. 'I got to hear someone say noto Diane today.' Sean actually called? Mm-hmm.You should've been there. He was all doctorly, like "No devices for the next48 hours. Doctor's orders." So good. I wish I was there. Oh. What did youget up to today? Oh, you know, boarding, riding, more boarding. I talked to Diane and, uh... I had lunch with Ben. Like, a lunch lunch? Huh. What'd you guys talk about? Nothing heavy. I guess he worksat a snowboarding company. - Mm-hmm.- And.. - We talked about my manuscript.- What? Yeah, I accidentally left it out and I guess he sort of read it. You don't show your writingto anybody. Now you're telling me he skippedout on snowboarding today to read your manuscript? He's a big reader. I don't know. Oh, and then, before that, we got stuck together 'on a chairlift.' What? I was trying to avoid him. Guess you didn't seethe sauna rules. Number one, no brooding. Look, it's just thischarity thing tonight. I feel like I should go. I thought you weren't doingany public events. Yeah, I know. The woman running it, she was very convincing. And she saidshe could put me at the back. No media, no name tags. Then go. No biggie. I'll be right there at the bar winning the trivia contestwithout you. Yeah, but see, that'sthe thing. It's our last night. I feel like I should be hangingwith the group, you know? The group? And, uh, which members of the group do you anticipate missing?'Cause I know it isn't me. 'Cara?' Did she say something about me? No, but I'm sensing she dislikes you less than she did yesterday. Meg, you know thatI am on the dating cleanse. And even if I wasn't, Ben is not good dating material. He's got way too much going onbehind the scenes. He's got secret meetings and snowboard deliveries. I like to write mysteries, not live them. And after everythingthat happened on New Year's I just, I wanna be cautious. Hm, fair enough. Just... don't be too quickto judge him. He'll show you who he isin his own time. Tell me this. What would happenif you told her the truth? You mean, if I told her who I am? Yeah, but then, she's just one mouse click away from reading that story. Well, I'm guessingyou're pretty beat so you wannajust rest up tonight? No, tonight is our last night and rumor has it thatthere's this trivia contest. And Sean asked meto enter with him. - Oh, cute.- You wanna come? Ah, no, I don't wanna be a third wheel. You could be the fourth wheel. Why don't you ask Ben to join? That might conflictwith dating cleanse. It's not a date, it's trivia. No, I, I meant writing it. I still owe Diane one more post. I was hopingto hike back up to the chalet and get one last gulpof fresh air before I start. - You sure?- Yeah. Oh, hey.Just the girl I was looking for. - Oh, hey.- You, uh, you heading out? Yeah, I'm gonna hike back upto the chalet. I have some work to finish. So you're staying in tonight? Um, I don't know. Actually,M-Megan mentioned something about a trivia contest. I'm not sureif that's your speed, but if-- Uh, what time? Like, eight-ish. 8:00? Um.. You know, I-I sort of committedto something at 8:00 which I should probablyfocus on.. Will you, will you just give meone minute? I should actually head outbefore it gets dark. Jennifer. Ben. What do you think? That looks awesome. Look, I've-I've had a changeof heart about tonight. That's great. Happy to hear it. - Can I bring a guest?- Sure. Cara? ♪ We have got no moneybut we've got this ♪ ♪ We have got no moneybut we've got this love ♪ ♪ We don't need every answer'cause we've got this ♪ ♪ We don't need every answer'cause we've got this love ♪ Ben, what are you doing? Look, I'm sorry I took offback there. I was trying to seeif I could bring a plus one. - Plus one?- Yeah. The woman I was talking to she's throwing thisauction dance tonight. It's for Camp Snow. I don't knowif you've heard of it. Sure, yeah, they send underprivileged kids to snowboarding camp. Right, so my company donated some boardsto the benefit tonight. Now, I know you have a deadline. I have no ideaif it would be fun but I do know the chance of having funwould be much higher if, if you were with me. Um, okay.But how is this gonna work? 'Cause you're not datingand I'm not dating. No, we don't have to call ita date. Nope, mm. We can call it an outing. 'But we have to leavepretty soon.' Oh, hence the snowmobile? If you say so. Alright. - What do I hold on to?- Me. Okay.. Well, for once,I'm glad I over-packed. Am I overdressed? No, you're perfect. For the occasion, I mean. Oh, right. Of course. Oh, boy, I must look ridiculous in this. Then we will lookridiculous... together. Cara, listen. The reason I'm involvedin this thing tonight-- Ah, see, an overly curious person would need to knoweverything about you. Good thingyou're not one of those. Let's just enjoy our date. Outing. Hi. So nice to see you again. Thank you so much for coming. 'I just wanted to let you know' how much your donationsmean to us. - Enjoy yourself. Bye.- Thank you. Hi, Ben. Oh. You must be the guesthe asked me about. - Cara Reneau.- Jennifer. Nice to meet you. Ben, the snowboardslook fantastic. 'Good. Glad to hear it.' Oh, if you wanna come inand grab yourself a drink.. You know, actually, do you, you mind if we, uh just spend a couple of minutesin the library? Sure. This room, I had no idea it was even here. - Yeah.- It's great. I guess the lodgeused to be a private home. This is the only roomthat survived the renovation. I'm guessing you spenta lot of time in here as a kid? When I wasn't dominatingon the half pipe. Yeah, of course. Look at this. 'First edition.Arthur Conan Doyle.' "Valley Of Fear." I stayed up all nightreading that as a kid. Well, you're braver than me. I was so terrified of Moriarty I could only read itduring the day. Thank you for bringing me. Okay, full disclosure. I, actually, really wanted youto see this place. I don't know, I thought it might be a sign. - You know?- Of what? - Of what you should be doing.- Oh, really? So I should quit my joband go to grad school because of one of your signs? No, I meant, become a librarian. Yeah, maybe I shouldn't havebrought it up. No. No. Look, it's a big decision, right? I should talk about it. Both options are good options. I'm just not sure how I'll feelin a year from now. Okay, well, if you can't lookforward, can you look back? What made you wanna writemysteries, to begin with? It always felt likea safe place. You can inventdanger and adventures that have nothing to dowith your real life. 'And in the end, it all gets tied up' and it's usually, the good guy wins. I think you just nailedwhy I like reading so much. Look, if I were a betting man,I'd say you should jump on this grad-school thing. 'I would put money on the fact' that you can get your nameon this shelf. But you're not a betting guy 'cause you like to knowwhat you're getting. Well, I thought I did but this weekend'smade me realize there's something to be saidfor the unexpected. I mean, when you walked in to my chalet started handing outthe wine charms I was suremy weekend was ruined. And? - Oh, it's not over yet.- Hm. Okay, shall we? Welcome to the Annual Camp SnowBenefit Auction. 'If everyonecould please gather around.' Let's beginwith the Cyan 920 ice snowboard signed by Travis Bretz. 'We start the bidding at 1,500.' Do I hear 1,500? 'Man in the yellow tiefor 1,500.' Okay, the first snowboardwas made by tying two skis together and it was called a snoller. Snoller? - It's gonna be snurfer, watch.- I have to do snurfer. - That's so funny..- 'It is.' Yeah, I knew it, I knew it! - That's good.- Yes. Sold for 3,600 to the woman in stripes. Next upis the Cyan Limited Edition 920 Lightning. - "Freestyle. Boardercross."- B. - Boardercross, right?- You know.. I got through med schoolby picking B on all my multiple choices. That's how you got throughmed school? 'Yeah, yeah.' - Hah!- Air.. Air high-five. - Air..- Good job, good job. - It still hurts.- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay, that concludes the auction. Thank you so muchfor your generous support. 'I hope you all stay aroundfor the dance.' - I think that went pretty well.- Um, yeah. I'd say that adds upto a lot of happy campers. Ben, if you have a moment there's some peopleI'd like you to meet. Oh, okay. Uh, I.. Oh, but, um, Ben, you promised me this dance. Sorry. - You can't keep a lady waiting.- Yeah. ♪ How can you.. ♪ - Thinking on your feet, huh?- I should've worn my flats. I might have to be on my feetall night if she keeps hounding you. I can do this all night. So given all the boardsare Cyan Wintersports I'm guessingthat's where you work? Nothing escapes your eagle eye, inspector. Ben, can I steal a quick photo? Oh, I don't know, um.. It's justfor our next promo event. You two aresuch a lovely couple. Uh, okay. - Ah..- 'Thank you.' Camera shy? Publicity shy. So you deal with the public. I try and avoid it. Well, we seem to be in it now. Are we? I, I didn't notice. Works for Cyan Wintersports doesn't like publicity. You are quite the mystery, Ben. Oh, well, that's good, because you like mysteries. ♪ If you could open up.. ♪ Uh.. Hey, you mind if we, uh, get a bit of air? Maybe grab some champagne? ♪ Think we'd be just fine ♪ It's so beautiful. The lights and the snow. I wish I knew about this placeearlier with the library. I would've come here to write. It sort of reminds meof my favorite spot back home. Favorite spot? Yeah, it's just this cafe. It's sort of a bookstore, too. Anyway, they make their own scones. Wait, not the one on Ballard? With the chandeliers? Exactly.What, you've been there? Yeah, I-I go there all the time. That is so weird. I wonder how we've never 'crossed paths before.' Maybe it's a signwe were meant to meet here. Yeah, it's probablya good thing. Yeah, but I can see how things can getpretty overwhelming. Yeah. Oh. At your public-facing job at Cyan Wintersports. - Look at you, detective.- Mm. You've almost cracked this case. Yes, but there is oneset of dots that I can't seem to connect. Why come here if youdon't wanna be recognized? I don't know. I just figuredif I came up here 'where I first fell in lovewith the sport' maybe it would all stop feeling like work, you know? Maybe I could just press reset, start over. Well... here's to new beginnings. All sorts of new beginnings. Mm. You know, for someone who's not dating you're... pretty comfortableon an outing. - Well, maybe it's the company.- Yeah. Anyway, the wholenot-dating thing it was sort ofa recent development. So, who was he? It wasn't about a guy.It was about me. Like you said, hitting the reset. Although, I guess there was a guy. Well, I wish I could thank him. For what? For whatever he did to lose you. If he hadn't, I might not have met you. Ah.. One more dance? One more dance. Aw. 'Thank you.' Did you... get thisfrom the list of restaurants that Megan left for.. Well, Ben Livingston, Ben Livingston. You know, I think Jennifer went home. Oh, man. I never got to meetall those people. Oh, I mean, we don't have to keep dancing. We don't have to.. ...but we could. That is not your phone. That istotally someone else's phone. I'm so sorry. Do you mind if I.. Just really quickly.I just have to check. - Yeah.- It might be my boss. I'm really sorry.This is so embarrassing. - I, uh..- 'What is it?' Well, apparently, it's highly urgent that I call my boss backimmediately, stat, asap. - Okay.- I am so sorry. - No, do it.- This won't take long. It's a little latefor a business call. What's up? - Yes.- Hey, Cara. Oh, hey. I didn't knowyou two were still here. - Look at you, fancy-schmancy.- Mm.. Yeah, perfect blizzard attire. I'm guessing, Ben roped youinto that work event? Kicking and screaming.How are you two doing in there? Oh, we destroyed it. Well, I wouldn't say destroyed. It's not a cage fightor anything like that. And we still haveanother round to go. Hey, how did you finishthat final post so quickly? Well, I haven't actually started which, I'm guessing, is what all these emails and texts are about, so, if you'll excuse me.. Good luck. Oh, next round. Let's go. 'Cara, hi.' Hi, I got your text, and I don't want you to worry. I'll have that last post to youby midnight. So you haven't written it yet? - Uh, no, I haven't.- 'Good.' I think we might be ableto take it in a bit moreof an interesting direction. Happy ending for youand the reader. I'm not sure I understand. I'm looking at a photo of youat a charity event tonight. 'Okay.' With Ben Livingston. I mean, I went with a friend named Ben if that's what you're asking. So you know him? Yes. Yes, I think I do. The CEO of Cyan Wintersports? Wait, Ben is the CEO? The photo went live? So what does that mean? She's a girl I met here. Why do I evenhave to explain myself? Okay, okay, look, I know I saidI'd take no risks, but.. She's a what? 'It's a publicly-tradedcompany.' Livingston's beenon the entrepreneur's watchlist for the past three years. He didtell you all that, didn't he? Well, not in so many words, but-- 'Of course, he's a known player, but you're smart.' 'I'm sure you sniffed that outpretty fast.' Are you sure? Uh, the man I knowis nothing like that. I mean, if anything, he's honestly-- Tell you what,I'll text you a link and you can decide for yourself. Hold up.Your publicist said what? Cara's a journalist. Worse, a relationship journalist. One whose entire career, apparently is based on writingabout her own life about her own dates. - Are they any good?- It doesn't matter. I don't wanna wind upin one of them. Look... my publicist, he said it's probably best if I head back tonight. Do what you've gotta do. I'll get a ride back, figure something out. Are you sure you don't wannatalk this over with Cara? I mean, maybe there's an explanation. No, no. I gotta take thisfor what it is. It's a sign. It's a sign that thiswasn't meant to work out. See you in Seattle. Cara, you don't have to bethe victim in all this. What are you talking about? Let's turn the tableson this guy. Make the last Dating Cleansepost about Livingston 'how you metthe ultimate toxic bachelor' 'and threw him back.' I'm not using someone's name to get a higher click-through. You don't have to do anything. I mean, there are plentyof people who are perfectly happyworking on the beauty desk. I didn't thinkyou'd be one of them. - 'But maybe I was wrong.'- Diane, I-- I'm simply asking youto think about it, okay? You havetwo and a half more hours. I'm texting youthe headline right.. Diane? Great. Dead battery. Ugh. Yeah, I got a call, too. You know, I'm kinda beat. I think I'm gonna head back upto the chalet. But you know, um, Sean and Megan I think are gonna stayfor a while. Maybe you should hang outand stay with them. No, I, I gotta head back upanyway to get my truck. Some, some stuff came up. I gotta head back to the city. Tonight? Yeah, okay.Um, well, you better get going. Right. The longer we wait, the harder it will be. Best just to get it over with. Sure. The drive, I mean. Okay. And presenting the trophy to the newly crowned queenof ski trivia. - Congratulations.- Thank you. And to you, too. You deserve it. Yeah, yeah. How is itI've never seen you before and we live three blocks awayfrom each other? I mean, maybe I was meantto run in to you here. Run in to you, bump in to you. - Oh, my..- 'Too soon?' You know, this is gonna sound crazy but I'm almost, almost gladthat you did. I mean, I haven't had this much fun since, since I started working. Well, you say thatlike it has to end. Well, I am going home tomorrow. Yeah, true, but I was thinkingmaybe, uh, we could.. Guys, sorry to do this. We've just been informedthat the roads are closed. Now, they'll be back uponce the plows get through but maybe find a comfy couch. 'It could be a long night.' - I guess this is it.- Yep. Drive safely. Anyway, I have a lot of writing to do. Yeah. - Oh, great.- Let's see how bad it is. - Where's that little radio?- Ah, I got it. Let's see.. '...with snowfall ofup to two feet expected' 'and temperatures droppingto minus 40' 'residents are encouragedto stay inside' 'with road closuresin Powderbowl' 'Wenatchee Peak and Clara Lake.' Well, looks likewe're stuck here. 'Are you ready to try this?' Yeah, hang on, my fingers are numb. Hurry up. Freezing. Yeah. I don't get it. 'How did you manage to use allthose matches on the firepit?' I had to. I couldn't usethe EZ-Lite logs. - Why not?- Because then you would've won. 'How could I know we'd havethe only chalet' in the worldwithout a lighter? Who needs a lighterwhen you have a Girl Scout a battery and still wood? You're a lot better at thatthan me. Well, you must be goodat some things. How else would you becomethe CEO? Cara, I was trying to tell youbefore the auction. To be honest, I'm surprisedyou didn't figure it out. What with, you know, being a journalist and all. What, is this..Do you have a problem with that? You tell me.I might be a little biased. Journalists haven't alwaysgiven me a fair shake 'or done their fact-checking.' So that story about youwasn't true? You read it? And just so you know,I'm not that kind of journalist. I'm more on the... romanceand relationship beat. I write lists about dating. What, like, ten first-date don'ts? It was actually 20, but, yeah. It's funnyyou should mention it. You know what the first one was? Never leave abruptly. I guess I deserve that. Look, my publicist got upset 'when the picture of uswent live.' He said it would be bestif I just left. - So, it wasn't your idea?- No. Are you kidding? 'I didn't want the nightto end.' Look,I'm gonna tell you everything and let you be the judge. No matter how this endsbetween us I don't want it to bebecause of secrets. Will you just hear me out? Indoor camping. This is quite an endto the weekend, huh, Sean? No complaints here. I mean, nothing went the way I thought it would this weekend but, in a way I thinkit was exactly what I needed to get out of my work vibe. Don't I know it? I mean, with my devices gone and, let's face it, my boss gone I realized how muchI'm missing out on life. 'I need to make a change.' I need a long-term plan. I was, uh, more worried about your short-term plan. Really? Why? Like, I don't know. Dinner, Monday? I know this great Frenchrestaurant in our neighborhood. They serve a mean souffle. Maybe I can plan that far ahead. So I'm in college in Boulder, boarding every day and... I just think the boardscould be better, you know? So I just start shaping my own just clowning around with fiberglass and epoxyin my dorm room. But then, my friendsstart buying 'em. One of 'em goes pro, and, boom.Cyan was born. That sounds like a fairy tale. Yeah, it pretty much was until we went public last year. Then the board of directorstook over and they decided I was the brand and my life stopped being mine. All of a sudden, the peopleI was with, the people I dated they all affectedthe bottom line. Something tells me this is where the world-champion skiercomes in. You know, we were only datingfor about a month. She was training pretty hard, said I was distracting her and so we broke up. A week later, she blew outher knee, tanked at the games and the press decideda broken heart sounded better than a broken knee. Of course, it ran just as we were launching our women's line. Oh. Board of directorsalmost fired me just to keep up appearances. Appearances? But the company's yours. No, it's the shareholders' company and the board reports to them. They vote Mondayon if I get another term. So, what now? Well, they told meto stay out of the public eye. Mm. You know, Ben, our lives are pretty different but I sort of get it not knowing where you endand your work begins. That pretty much sums it up. But I was wrong not to justtell you all this stuff. No, I can see why you didn't. Look, we came up here to reset, not to meet someone. The whole Dating Cleanse-- - You know, Dat-Dating Cleanse?- Oh, yeah. It's a series of articlesthat I'm writing to.. Oh, no, what time is it? Uh... 11:45. Ugh, I was supposedto get my last post in today and before midnight. Well, there's no onestopping you. But I can't. My phone's deadand my laptop's dead. Can it waittill the power's back on? No, I have to do this now. Otherwise, I might never. - Okay, well, use mine.- Yeah? Yeah, got a few minutesof juice left and, uh, I'll send it outwhen the Wi-Fi is back up. Oh, thanks. This won't take long. Wait, you're doing it in there? It's freezing. Yeah, I have to. What that skier said about youis true. 'You are distracting.' I'm gonna take thatas a compliment. Don't get ahead of yourself. That was fast. Yeah. It's weird how easy things are when you knowwhat you need to do. - Think your boss will like it?- Tsk. I, I don't thinkit's what she's expecting but let's just say, it's what she's getting. I'm kind of inspired. Believe it or not, I've cometo a realization this weekend. - What's that?- Some risks are worth taking. Ah. Hey, hey, hey.We've come to rescue you guys. Ah, the stormfinally let up a bit. The roads opened upa little sooner than we thought. - Oh. Oh, look at that.- Oh. Hey, we can heat upthe pizza now. 'Uh, yeah. Uh, we've got wine.' - We can have a picnic.- Yeah, have a seat. Unfortunately, we're gonna have to eat and run. Yeah, this stormis just the opening. 'There's a bigger one comingin a few hours' and the roads could be closedfor days. And I have a 6 a.m..hip replacement on Monday. - 'Sorry, buddy.'- Come on. I'm gonna start packing.I might need a hand. So it seems like our outing'scome to an end. So it seems. But we arein the same area code which means I only have to askfor seven digits of your phone number, which is way less awkward. Uh, I don't know. What if your companydoesn't approve? If they don't, I might justhave to get a new company. I think this is your phone. Uh.. Uh.. I'm just gonnawarm up the truck. - You wanna explain this?- Look, Ben. I know what this looks like, but my boss she sends methese headlines, and I-- - How did that even come up?- No, it's-it's from before. - Before what?- Before my phone died. Nothing you're sayingmakes any sense. Okay, but you haveto believe me, please. 'This is justa big misunderstanding.' Is it? Because it seems likeit's black and white. Uh, this is all my fault. I should've told youwhat I was working on before. No, this is my fault. I was looking for signswhen there weren't any. Thanks for driving. Ah, if I keep my eyes onthe road, I won't have to think about how badlyI messed things up with Ben. Well, if you needan additional distraction 'I'm about to power up my phonefor the first time' in 24 hours. - Mm. Good luck.- Oh. - 'Oh!'- Oh.. 'Oh, no.' 'Oh, my goodness.' I gotta make a call. Do you mind listening in? It might cheer you up. Megan, thank goodness! Are you, are you alive? Are you close to the city? How are your hands? I'm fine. I, uh..Sorry to bother you. I just needto check the schedule. Ugh, my schedule's a mess. The intern who covered for you put it on East Coast time. Monday at 9 a.m. Is there time to fit inanother interview? For the new position? Of course.What's the candidate's name? I wanna look them up. Megan Marquand. That's you. Yes, it is. When I was screeningthe candidates I realizedthat I was just as qualified and I know your businessbetter than anyone else. It's just, I've, I've neverthought of you that way. Well, it's never too late to try. Huh. Well, till Monday then. 'Make sureyou bring your resume.' Okay. Thank you. I can't believeyou just did that. Uh, me, neither. I.. Well, if Diane is ever gonnasee me differently I have to see myselfdifferently. Do you mind helping meupdate my resume? No, of course not.It's a great idea. You know, sometimes peopleneed to see things on paper to realizewhat they've been missing. Hey, what's up? I thoughtwe were eating at your office. Yeah, we might wanna finda new lunch spot. Oh, no.Did the board vote to, uh-- They didn't get the chance. I quitas soon as I walked in the door. You quit the companyyou founded? Well, I founded one company,I'll found another, right? That's the idea, anyway. So you're free? Well, why aren't youjumping up and down, cheering? Right. Her. Yeah. You know the article Carawanted me to send to her boss? The one I thoughtwas someexposeabout me? It wasn't. I don't understand. What was it? Here, maybe I'll justread it to you. '"Dear Ms. White' "I cannot tell youwhat a learning experience "Mallory Magazine has been. "I've had some great experiences "and I've learned a great dealabout the industry people and myself." '"However, in light of my acceptance' "into a graduate program "please accept my resignation effective February 1st." Now, Cara, I knowyou didn't write this, did you? Look, I knowhow vindictive men can be so if that Livingston guywrote this or convinced you to write it we can just delete, delete. 'I mean, unless..' I really did learn a lot here. I see. I just, uh, I wish I would've known what I could've donedifferently. Nothing, you have a magazineto run here 'and that's whatyou have to do.' This is just what I have to do. Well, I don't agreewith your choice but I do admire your conviction. Few people have it.Hang on to it. Okay. Cara. Go get 'em. Hey, Cara. 'I'm gonna miss youaround here.' Oh, me, too Ms. Operations Manager. - This came for you.- Thanks. 'I was afraidyou wouldn't show up.' And yet here I am. Look, I know"I'm sorry" won't cut it. You could always try it out. I am really, really sorry. Anyone seeing that headlinewould've thought the same thing. No. I should've given youthe benefit of the doubt. Well, I'll have plenty of timeto think about forgiving you.. ...when I'm in grad school. You accepted? 'That's awesome. Congrats.' I'll have plenty of timeto make it up to you.
