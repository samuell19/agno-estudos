Christine- Christine. Stop. I... Christine, it's gonna be okay. ( indistinct chatter ) I know what I... -Oh, no, here we go again. No, it was a solar flare. I saw a documentary on it once. It's a cause of major blackout. A solar flare would knock out the cars just like an EMP would. -EMP? Electromagnetic pulse. It's like a nuclear blast, the same as a solar flare. How do we know that it wasn't a terrorist? -coulda been a dirty bomb. Don't you hear what we're saying? The cars would not work. It's definitely not a nuclear attack. Okay, fine then. What caused the lights to go out? It could be billion things. Everybody listen up. ( chatter ) All right. Listen up. Okay. Everybody knows the power is out. It's been that way for five days. Here, surrounding towns, cities, we're a community and we'll behave like a community. For all we know, the entire world's gone dark. I brought Phil in from Hydroelectric to share with us what is going on. Phil? Well, at approximately 9:15 A.M. Eastern Standard Time, all of the computers went offline at the power station. We can't explain it. We ran all the tests... ...that we could but we found nothing. You work at the power plant you tell me that you know nothing? No, we did...we did the standard... ...diagnostic tests. Sheriff... Okay. Okay. The hardware was... -All right. All right. Listen. We worked the standard. Listen, we did a diagnostic... ...of the software and the engineer. Honestly, there's nothing I... Thank you Phil. All right. Everybody quiet down. Thanks. What we decided to do is we have gathered the remaining supplies and food and we don't have a lot. So, we're gonna start rationing as of today. That's right, as of today. Community, people. Our truck's coming in with more stocks. And what about the national government? You people are asking the wrong questions. You have no idea what's coming. What are you gonna do when they leave the cities and come pouring in here? ...Said to turn over. I don't know. I can't... This is a reality we all have to face. When the food runs out, they'll leave the city and their homes and come to ours. Guys, I'm so sorry to bother you. You wouldn't give me a hand with my car, would you? They will come soon and look at everything we've got. Everything what? -What are you talking about? -That doesn't make any sense. No, settle down. No, no, no, no. That is not what's gonna happen. Now, what's gonna happen... Don't be so naive, Frank. You haven't seen enough to make that statement. What do you think is gonna happen? We're gonna gather food and hand it out? We're gonna share? We're gonna take them in? What are you gonna do when you have a thousand people coming this way? How about a hundred thousand? What are you talking about? We're a hundred miles from the nearest city. Nobody's coming out here. Buddy- You're scaring everybody. Are you happy? You and I will have this conversation and we will handle it if and when it happens. If and when it happens. Take a look outside. Can't you feel that? It's already begun. ( laughter ) ( screams ) No! Quiet ( screams ). ( screams ) ( car engine starts) Excuse me. Jim. What you say, true? Gather your supplies and board up your windows. Get ready. That's a bit strong, don't you think? Believe what you want, Martin. Wait, what was that? I said believe what you want. No. How do you know my name? You look just like him. ( truck engine revving ) ( music ) ( birds chirping ) ( music ) ( birds chirping ) What do you say? Oh, you...I...no, I don't know. I don't know, man. What, are you worried about your political career or something? Don't worry, I'm not gonna tell anybody. Come on, Tommy. -There's no one out here. You know, say that you didn't inhale, like everyone else. No, it's not... ( makes Indian noise ) Okay. All right. I'll take them. You, asshole. It's time to get psychedelic.

( birds chirping ) ( bang ) ( panting ) This is more than I expected from this location. Come on, Sheriff, we've been waiting long enough. Listen, I expect you to be mindful of your neighbor Do you understand? Go. We've got to ration it out. That goes for you, too, Martin. No, no, Frank, Frank, it's Julia, she's my wife. What happened? What? What is it? She's bleeding. I don't know...I don't know why she's bleeding. Hey, we didn't get any back here. This is bullshit. We've been here all morning. Then you're gonna wait another goddamn minute. I've had enough out of you. What happened? -I don't know. Okay. You're gonna need to take her to County General up north on Route 2 about 30 miles from here, it's in...you can't miss it. Frank, that's not gonna work. I don't have gas. I have a flat. I can't make it. Best bet is to go to Jimmy. You know Jimmy, right? -Yes, I know him. He was an Army medic. That's the best I can do right now. Okay? It's my wife, please, Frank. Martin. Look around. I cannot leave here. Come on, Sheriff. I need my share now. Come on, Sheriff, we're waiting for this bullshit. Please. She's pregnant. I think we might've lost the baby. Okay. Okay. I mean, I will.

Will we. Listen, I don't wanna say anything in front of Julia but Frank, Frank was shot. There was a fight. He tried to break it up. They killed him, man, they fucking killed him.

He really cared about you, Martin. He never said as much. That's just the way he was. I didn't know how sick he was till the very end. He'd be proud of you. You did the right thing coming out here. ( door closes ) ( indistinct chatter ) Really now, there's only one way to find out, right? ( laughs ) I really don't wanna die. Please, please, don't let me die here, please. I don't wanna die. Danielle. Hey. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. That's not gonna happen. You hear me? I promised. They used this bottle. You're a fucking liar. Lee. Lee. Uh-mm. The next one we find is mine. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Of course, Buddy. The next one...the next one we find is yours for sure. But that one right there, you see that little nugget? Yeah. Yeah. That one there, that one's mine. ( laughs ) In fact, if you all will excuse me. ( cries ) Hi. Just ignore him. Don't look at him, Danielle. ( whistles ) Ignore him like everybody else. No, no, no! -Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Listen to me. I know where there's food. Lots of it. Well, I think I'm gonna turn in. There's some wine in the cabin. Turn into what? A pumpkin. ( laughs ) Goodnight. Goodnight. Thank you, Jim. Thank you so much, sweetheart. Nice to have met you. My pleasure. ( sighs ) Do you want some dessert? No, I'm full. That's not what I meant. I have something to tell you. Damn. Yes. ( laughs ) Come with me, now. ( engine whirring ) ( tire screeching ) ( gun cocks ) You know how to use one of these? Good. You're gonna have to. Do you remember the ranch 10 years ago? I remember. It's loaded. Let's move. We'll make it through this. Come, come, come, come, come. Hey. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Can you let her go now? Shh. What else do you want from us? I'm not quite finished just yet. Anything behind us? No. It looks clear. If they get close enough, you shoot. You need to reload, I'll cover you. -Got it. What do you want from me? I'm gonna need you to go to the front door. I'm gonna need you to knock and I'm gonna need you to see who's there, okay? You're gonna be perfect. Don't make me...don't make me go in there. They got guns in there. Oh, I imagine they do. Don't make me go...don't make me go in there. I don't wanna go. Ahh. Oww. Shh. Oh, it's your bad arm. I'm sorry. Go, go, go, go, go, go. ( sobs ) Holden. Get down. Get down. Hello. Is there anyone home? Please, open up. Please, someone open the door, please. Please, I'm really hurt? Please, anyone, just please help me. Please, open up. Please, someone open the door, please. Please, I'm begging you, please, open the door. Is anyone home? Turn off your light, baby. -What? What? Turn off your light. You see those tents over there. -Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna go over to those tents. -No. I want you to stay right here. Okay? -No. Don't leave me. Christine? I want you to stay right here. I need to get us help, okay? I need to get us help. And this is what I'm gonna do. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. You hear me? -Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I want you to take this. Okay. Okay. It's all right. Gentlemen, I'm gonna need you two to come with me around back. The rest of you, count to 20 and start firing. Do you wanna eat? Of course you do. Come with me. ( gun cocks ) ( sobbing ) Five, four, three, two, one. ( gunshots ) ( screams ) Danielle. No. I'll take the ground floor. You search the house for anything we can use. ( gunshots ) Now. ( gun cocks ) ( gunshots ) Reloading. God damn it. Anything up there? Nothing up here. What do you mean there's nothing up here? I'm out. Hold on. Martin! ( gunshot ) Jim! ( groaning and grunting ) Excuse me. Excuse me. I don't have a gun. I'm not trying to pull anything. I need your help. When Lee finds out, you're a fucking dead man. ( grunts and groans ) Ha. I've got friends. They're held up by gunmen. Whoa. Whoa. Who's got guns? I don't know. I...they were in a truck. Christine! ( grunting ) Christine. Tommy. Tommy, please stop. Please help, please. Tommy, stop. -Baby, listen to me, okay? Please, stop. No. They're gonna take us. They're gonna take us. Stop. -Now, Christine, please. Listen to me. Stop it. Now, no, no. Stop. -Christine, please. Stop. ( gunshot ) Christine. Oh, no. Please, baby, please. Get back. Get back, all of you. Get back. Don't come close. Christine, is that your name, honey? I shot him. I know. You didn't know. -I shot him. It's not your fault. No. It's not. ( crying ) Oh, my God. It's over. ( crying ) No! ( panting ) ( on TV ) I want to tell you something. This is really important and I want you to hear me. When I'm gone... ( on TV ) You're not going anywhere. You hear me? ( on TV ) Jim, please. Look, come here. Come here. Come closer. I want you to see what I see. ( electronic beep ) You're a good man, Jim. There's a good world out there. I don't want you to be alone. I want you to see what I see. There's good people just like you. Don't give up on the world. Don't give up, Jim. ( cymbals clanging ) ( music ) Captions by East Pole Media
