-Do you have any qualifications? -No. -Not even the school diploma? -Well, no. Why? I need a diploma to carry cases of Coke? Having a diploma never hurt anyone. I'm sorry, I don't have one. You want to know where I was on the day of the exam? I was fishing with a friend. And on exam day I went to see a dirty movie. -Do you have any ID? -Sure thing. There. It's out of date. Yeah, and? Get it reissued, or come back with a passport. Are you nuts? You can see it's me on the front. It's more than enough to fill in that form. Are you single? Married? Single. Do you have a wedding ring? Yes, I'm single, I wear a ring, now piss off. Any more questions? Daft cow. EMPLOYMENT AGENCY Are you laughing at me like that? Why not take a picture? It'll last longer. Say, mister. My sister and I are looking for work. Do you know where we might find some? Right here. We just had an argument with a secretary in there. You too? It's the third time. We never bring the right paperwork. -You're looking for work? -No, I just came to take a look. -What do you do for work? -I don't. I'm a hairdresser. She works in sales. And you're out of work? -We got ourselves fired. -That's no good at all. She slapped her manager. She slapped both her boss and his wife. Why? He kept touching me with his fat fingers. Mine said they saw me with my hands in the till. We always copy each other's behavior anyway. -D'you think we look alike? -Huh? Sure… I guess maybe a little. Do you have a minute? Sure. How about having a chat in the cafe? That might be better, eh? Well? -If you like. -Let's go, then. There's a cafe over there. So, you're looking for work. We can't seem to stay in one place. -Why? -No idea. We'd like to so something else, but we don't know what. I chose to be a hairdresser, thinking it would be fun. Same for me and sales. I don't mind cutting hair, but the old biddies… -Are they a pain? -You sure have to be patient. They never stop talking about stuff, their periods, their abortions, problems with their lovers, and husbands. After they've asked me to take their dog for a piss. Josyane will tell you. She's worked with me twice now. The first time was in Neuilly at a salon. I asked her to come help rinsing. We were gone in three days. We couldn't handle it. -The best one was in Belleville. -That was crazy! We were working in the men's underwear department. All day, the oldies would ask for underwear recommendations. We managed to get them to try on women's underwear. We had so much fun that they gave us the boot. It's funny that at your age, you don't have a job. -You think? -Guys your age all have one. Well, not me. What's up with that? -You don't want to say? -No, it's fine. I had a job. I ran my own company. And? I got tired of it one day, so I sold the lot. Why's that? I got fed up. -What kind of business was it? -A bike shop. Semi-wholesale, with my wife. And your wife, what about her? She remarried, and runs a shop now. And are you happy? I have more freedom. -So, you don't have a full-time job? -No. I tried my hand at a few things, but none of it worked. -It isn't easy. -You don't think. How old are you? -Twenty. -I'm nineteen. -You live with your parents? -Yes. I'm from Créteil, and she's from Raincy. -And what are you doing now? -Nothing. Lunch together sound good? Damn it, I can't, I have to make lunch for someone. -How about you? -I'm going with her. -Do you need a lift? -Okay, sure. Good job I remembered. I nearly forgot. It's my granddad. I have to prepare his food. Normally my mother does it, but she's on calls today. Noon. I have to go. Can we go now? As you wish. -Is this one yours? -Yes. -It's really nice. -Go on, jump in. I like it. You can really fit a lot in here. Anything I like. -So, we're going to Créteil, right? -Yes, please. -Does the radio work? -No, it's broken. What do your parents do for work? Dad works on the metro, and mum in a hospital. My dad works at the post office, and mum in a cafeteria. And you don't want to be like them? Metro, sleep, back to work, no thanks! -Any holidays planned this year? -Of course. -Whereabouts? -The same place as always. -St. Tropez? -Ah! This guy's crazy. Do we look like St. Tropez girls to you? It's pretty rubbish, I heard. Our friends go every year. They rabbit on about it. St. Trop here, St. Trop there, it was like this, it was like that… And my ass, is that St. Trop, too? It's totally outdated. We go to St-Quay-Portrieux, in Brittany. What hick-town is that? It's not a hick-town, it's a seaside resort. It's okay, but we want to try somewhere new. Maybe overseas. Before the holidays, we met a guy who wanted to take us to Spain. And? He wanted us to send the lift back to him. I didn't get it, but she did. Roger wanted to break his nose. -And who's Roger? -Our friend. Careful, the trench is out. Make sure to step on the boards. Come in. Hi, Granddad. I've brought some friends. Please, sit down. I'll heat up his soup. Josyane, could you get the cutlery? You were right, the cupboard's full. Sardines in oil, ragu, saucisson. See, I told you. -What's wrong with him? -He's paralyzed. Say whatever you like, he won't understand a thing. Who's that guy? I don't know. Don't you think he looks like Gerard? You're crazy, he's way too old. -Who is it then? -Don't know. In any case, I've heard dying cats sing better. You like singers? Depends. We prefer pop music. English groups are awful. -The Shadow Boys, you know them? -Nope. -And The Electric Childs? -Nope. You know nothing then? That guy looks like a right gay. Wasn't Roger meant to pop by this afternoon? Yeah. Oh well, I'll be out. You had something planned? No, someone was supposed to pop by. -Are you far away? -No, ten kilometers before Rouen. We're going to Faubourg St-Martin for the dresser. Then we're off. How much do you make for one of those? I'll pay 1,050 for it and sell it on for 2,000. That's amazing! Sometimes it works out even better than that. Sometimes I'll make 3,000 on a single item. Great. Put it down over here. -The old guy's got some cash to spend. -It's presents day. I don't want to sound rude, but those hats don't suit you. That's why it's funny! If you had as much money as him, what would you buy? I'd buy a massive house, and I'd move in my whole family. And then what? I'd go wandering. I'd travel the world. I'd do the same. You see, we've always got the same ideas. Damn it, not again! What's the problem? I don't know. It did this to me two days ago. We're about to break down. What fun. Are you a good mechanic? I haven't the first clue, aside from fixing bikes. That's unlucky. -I'm sure it's coming from this. -I think it's this. Well, I've got a feeling it's the ignition. If it's the ignition, then it's no problem! It might be nothing at all, but that doesn't mean I can fix it. I need a garage. Ah, shit! I'll try again, but I'm not sure it'll work. There's no need to force the matter. Let's get going. -Can we come with you? -Of course. You should, in fact. There's no guarantee of a quick fix. You see, it's a good thing we broke down. My dad says roadside cafes serve the best food. -You often go to the restaurant? -Once a year. -What do you like to eat? -I love paella. When I'm rich, I'll eat one a day. I really like salmon. At Inno's they serve really good salmon. We got one for Christmas one year. And oysters, you like them? -Yeah, sure. -I prefer mussels. Those big ones from Spain. -Can I have some more? -Yes, of course. -Do you think we're gluttons? -Not at all. I like watching you eat. -Are you into politics? -No. My dad is a communist. He's a nice guy. Every Sunday morning he sells the Humanity newspaper. -And you? -Me and my brother, we stay in bed. We feel a bit guilty about it. My mother thinks he's nuts. My parents go to Sunday mass each week. You should see the family meetings some Sundays. When my dad and hers get talking, sometimes they need separating. They get close to fighting. -You don't think politics are stupid? -No. In itself it isn't stupid. People make it stupid. Maoists, Trotskyists, Asshologists. You sure get plenty of those. -Okay, where to now? -Hang on. Where are we? You can take the next right. It's here. There, on the left. No need to take Josyane home. She'll stay here tonight. -She will? -That's right. -See you tomorrow. -Okay. You took down the address? 13 rue de la Crêpière, in a garage, behind a cafe. Okay then, bye for now. Here you go. Are you mad? What's this for? -For your help today. -What help? The work you did. Please take it. -But we didn't do much. -Take it. If you insist. We weren't too badly-behaved at lunch? Not at all. -See you tomorrow morning then. -See you in the morning. Goodbye. -Hey. Not too early, okay? -No. It's this one. Maybe he's not in. Morning! You don't look very awake. -What time is it? -10:00. Ah. Come in. Excuse me, I'm going back to bed. I caught a chill last night. We came to make you breakfast. That's nice of you. -See what we brought you? -Cake and croissants. One Camembert and a liter of red. You spoil me. It's really nice here. Did you do these paintings? No, it's a friend's work. He left me them when he moved out. What a nice friend. Do you drink tea or coffee for breakfast? -Coffee. -Where's the kitchen? It's there. The light's to the right. You have everything here. Nice and comfy, aren't you? Look at that. See? And that! -Where are the mugs and the coffee? -In the cupboard above the sink. It's funny, he's so well organized. A hardcore single male. What's so funny? Josyane said you're a hardcore single male. See this? Are you done taking the mickey? She's the one who's doing it. -Is that coffee coming? -The water's boiling now. Come look. Is that your wife in the picture? -What picture? -In the cupboard. No, that's a friend. She's hot. She is. But she's also really stupid. -You're not with her anymore? -No. His lordship is served. Maybe you don't like Camembert with coffee? Oh, sure I do. -My dad eats it that way. -Really? You got any discs? Sure, but only jazz, and New Orleans. -I doubt you'd like it. -That's old-folks' music. I know, but the Electrocats are better. -The Electric Childs. -"Electric Chats". -"Childs"! -"Tchaïz"! -You want some more coffee? -Sure! You have a lot of stuff. 39 years is enough time to amass lots of things. -You're only 39? -Yes. -I thought you were older. -So did I. How am I supposed to take that? As a compliment. We prefer men in their forties. -Really? -Are you collecting these? -What are those? -Oilcloths. -Let's see. -Look! -Wow, that's nice! -Beautiful, eh. -Yeah. -Say, they're really something. Look at that one. It would look great in the house. Where are they from? You sell oilcloths? I sold a few. But I stopped about six months ago. -I worked the markets, with my buddy. -You had a market stall? Yeah. We did okay. -It's really nice, I heard. -Why did you stop, though? My friend got married, and his wife told him to stop. I didn't want to do it alone. Still, I kept those and the patent. -There's tons of them. -There's twice that in the garage. You don't want to try again? -Try what? -Running a stall. We can start when you like. We'd find it fun. It would be fun. I'd enjoy it a lot. It's not all that cushy. Not every day's a sale. And you have to be there at 5 a.m. -That's fine, we can manage that. -Sure! -Go on, it would be such fun. -Oh, go on! Please! -We can work, you know. -We'd sell loads of oilcloths. I'm not against it. But don't think it's going to be easy. Some days you don't make a dime. We can always try. -When can we start? -Tomorrow? Hang on, I have to think it through. -Another cup? -Yes. Thank you. -It's fun getting up early. -Right, you really feel alive. Okay, let's go, ladies! -Where are we going, then? -Joinville. I've got a cousin in Joinville. I haven't seen him in years. It was the guy I was flirting with in Normandy. The one who called you his little pearl. How many oilcloths can you sell in one morning? Depends. Sometimes none, sometimes it's a lot. No one knows why. And what if it worked out, and we sold loads? -Don't get carried away. -I'm certain it'll work! -And if it does work, will you keep us? -Sure, why not. If we make some money, we'll have to buy another car. -That's the last thing you want to do. -Why? We'd have to sell lots to be able to buy another truck. And it's better to have money than ride in a new car and have to pay fees. And what if we made a killing? What if we had all the money in the world? Well, then, we'd drive a Rolls-Royce! -No one's around. -You sure this is the place? Sure it is. We're just the first ones here. You have to get here early to get a good place. Okay, let's wait a minute. Ah, there he is. -Who? -The usher. Wait there and behave yourselves. What a nice guy. Why's he doing this? Do you think he's flirting? No, we're way too young for him. So, why's he doing this? He must be bored, and we make him laugh. How's things? See, I'm back. Hi there, Henri. I've recruited some staff. Looks like you're having fun. -Are they into older guys? -Don't be daft. We met at the job-seeker's office. They wanted some work. They liked the idea of market selling, so here we are. -Guislaine, Josyane. -Hello. Ladies. Okay, where are we today, then? -There. Does that work? -Very well. It's a good one, you know. Close to the food stalls. You'll catch all the ladies. Okay, let's get unpacking. Thanks again! -Ladies. -Goodbye. Wait here a second, I'll bring the truck around. I think he's amazing, I've really got the hots for him. -You think you'd sleep with him? -That's not what I meant. I really like his style. He's really masculine. Badmouthing me again? Quite the contrary. Nothing but nice things. -Please tell me. -You're pushing your luck now. Come on, let's unload. Then we can go have a soft drink. Oh! This is where we're setting up. Come look, I need to show you how to set up shop. You put the oilcloths over here. Here, the ones you want to display. The small pieces… go over here. You can roll out twenty or so. Modern ones, classic ones. Some customers are just after the same ones. On the other hand, young couples prefer uplifting, floral motifs. Like this one, eh. They shouldn't have to look around. There has to be a selection. Got it? Go ahead and start displaying them. I'll be right back. -Is he nuts? He's leaving us alone? -He'll be back. We're big girls, we'll manage. Come and take a look, ladies. Don't be afraid. Come get a close-up. Come look, come touch, these are real works of art! -Come and smell! -Come and touch! -Come be amazed! -Come buy! -But of course! -Our items have no equal! -Our oilcloths! -The most beautiful ones around. Come see! -What a couple of idiots. -For sure. Your girls seem to be getting on with it. It's all new to them. -What's the score, then? -Haven't sold anything yet. I wouldn't worry. -Sales pick up around 10:00. -Really? -You want a go? -Sure. We've done it, Charlie. Three sold already. That's good. So, how do you like it? Yes, selling is great fun. How about you, you coming? I'm coming. I'm going back. I can't leave Josyane alone. She's a funny one, and pretty nice-looking. Yes, she's a good one. We told you we'd do alright. -We're pretty good at sales. -I have to admit, you are. We've sold half your stock. We'll be rich soon! I know why you didn't sell much. If you spend your mornings on pinball. -We were taking turns. -Even so. -This job takes some effort. -It's a client-facing job. In the beginning I was like you. After a while I relaxed a bit. You've got it. -We're the real deal, eh! -The queens of oilcloth. -You're really spoiling us. -You think so? We just stuff our faces. If our friends could see us, they'd go crazy. They've never experienced anything like this. -And Jacky? -He'd like to smack us. Why's that? Whenever he sees us with another guy, he sees red. He thinks he's Alain Delon. He's alright but he gets about. Jacky, is he the guy with the bike? Yeah. A 250. He gets on my nerves. He's always showing off. Shall I order some more oysters? No. No thanks. -I'm holding out for paella. -And me, the salmon. Come take a look, miss. See, nothing but quality. I'm sure yours is worn out. You should change it. You're wrong. It's a new one and looks great. You can always have a second one. I think that's that for this morning. I told you, yesterday was just luck. Some days you don't get even one sale. Why the long faces? -It's disheartening. -No, don't worry. It'll go better tomorrow. Right, it's time to pack. I'm meeting someone at the tobacconist. Come find me. Okay. Go on. -I'm happy to see you. -Me too. -What're you drinking? -A Martini. A Martini, please. -What happened to you? -I gave it all up. That's what I thought. Dédé found himself a broad to settle down with. -So, you're starting fresh? -Right, with the two girls. Cheers. Ah, the markets. They're good fun. -It doesn't pay. -I know, I did nothing all morning. It's no good, I tell you. With their fixed-price sheets, they'll end up killing us. There's no work around here. Maybe in the suburbs. -You reckon? -You can still find work there. It's not as easy as it once was. The bloody competition. Supermarkets, big shopping malls etc. But you can still earn. But Paris and the surrounding area, that's done now. -I don't know about the suburbs. -Tomorrow there's a good one for you! In Normandy, Orbec. It's both a marketplace and a trade fair. I would go myself, if I could. Well worth the trip. -Orbec? -Yeah, Orbec. There's the girls. -Hello. -Hello, ladies. We're going out of town later. -Where to? -Normandy. Excellent! What are the ladies drinking? -A Coke. -Same. Two Cokes, please. Orbec, isn't that where you spent your holidays? -Where are we? -In the Eure. It's over there. It was called Notre-Dame de Pourson. It was a little village. Wasn't that where you flirted with the cousin from Joinville? Right. He lent me his Brassens discs. He worshiped him. He'd play his music too. -Go on, tell us! -You know the story. I don't. Go on, tell us. He'd tell me I had lips like peaches and that he wanted to pick them. That I was his pearl, his gold button. What a poet! He wrote me so many letters full of words I barely understood. What happened to him? He sells vegetables in Joinville. That's not bad for a poet! He can have his full of peaches. What a hole. Everyone sleeps huddled together in these parts. No, look, there's a party! What if we went? Sure, but first we have to find a room. FULL Do you have a room, please? No, only one, with a big bed. -Ah, you don't have any others? -No, the hotel is full. -I'm afraid it'll be the same everywhere. -I know, I've been to them all. Oh well… Thank you. Well? There's only one room with a big bed in it. You girls take it, I'll sleep in the car. -Don't be ridiculous. -We'll figure something out. We can sleep on the floor, or there might be a pull-out. -Yeah! -Let's do that. Well, then… There. Hey, there! -How much? -One fifty… Two francs. It won't be difficult, you'll see later. -Yeah. -They're playing pop music! Go ahead. Have you seen the band? -Good fun, eh. -Yeah. -Which one of you is coming up? -You, go ahead. -Do you dance? -No, thank you. Bitch. No need to be rude, you scumbag! -They're starting up again. -Who? They're going to give Guislaine problems. -What happened? -Some guy just called me a bitch. Leave me alone! Hands off the girl. Look, it's daddy to the rescue. Show's over, guys! -You okay? -Yeah, fine. Those guys are nuts. Lie down, we'll clean you up. Go ask the woman downstairs if she has some antiseptic. Take off your jumper. You must be covered in bruises. They really hurt you. Tomorrow morning you'll be black and blue. And you'll have a black right eye. My, my. -You often get into fights? -Sometimes. Jacky gets into fights every Sunday, and always over us. She gave me some ether, too. We'll be the best nurses ever! You ought to put on some pajamas. Do you have any? No. Get in bed, you'll warm up in no time. I'm not taking the bed just because I'm a bit bruised. -We're going to sleep on the floor. -No. -Get in. -We did some camping for a while. Now, behave yourself. Time for a delicate operation. Pass me the ether, please. -I don't look too ridiculous? -Of course not, you're just sweet. On the forehead… You took a punch to the face. -Be careful. -Ow. It stings! You're okay. Let's take a look at the rest of you. -You took a hell of a punch. -That's from a kick. -What brutes. -They don't know how to fight. No need for the antiseptic, there aren't any cuts. Let's see if there are any others. And your hand? -Now you can get some rest. -No, you take the bed. No! We have no problem sleeping on the floor. -No… -We're going to get cross. Okay then… -What time are we up tomorrow? -5:30 a.m. Ah! Now those are cute nightgowns. -We stole them from the Prisunic. -They're for 12-year-olds. Let's see, how shall we do this? -Let's take one of these sheets off. -Sure. Look in there and see if there isn't another one. No, there's nothing in there. Never mind, there are two here. Get in bed, come on. How silly of us! We could just all get in, that's simplest. You aren't going to rape us! Let's do that, then. It'll keep us warm. You in the middle and one of us on each side. If Jacky and Roger saw us now, they'd kill us. -This bed's massive. -It's at least 150 cm. The mattress is great too. Not like the one at home. My bed has a big hole in it. All good? Are you all tucked in? -Yeah, I'm good. -Me too. -So, are we turning the light off? -Yeah. -Okay, good night. -Good night! -All good? -Yes. -Lights off? -Sure. Right then. -Whose foot is that? -Mine. Is it yours? Sorry, I thought it was Josyane's. -You shuffle much in the night? -No. I do sometimes. I might jump up suddenly. Really? Okay, let's get some sleep. Tomorrow's a long day. -Okay, good night. -Good night! Morning. I feel much better. She's out cold. Oh. Wakey wakey. Watch it. I'll go ask downstairs if they can do room service for breakfast. Right. -Did that really happen? -What got into us? They can't do it. It's too early. It doesn't matter. Let's eat downstairs. Can you grab my jumper? I'll go take care of the bill. You'll join me downstairs? -Don't be long. -Okay. What we did was crazy. Come take a look, ladies and gents. 30 francs will buy you this marvelous cathedral. Chartres, with it's fabulous spire, grander than all the saints and kings, as Péguy once said. Chartres, a unique, gigantic cathedral. A jewel of French religious art, here before your very eyes. Miniaturized and reproduced to the smallest detail. The obscure and colossal work of a 16th century mason. For only 30 francs. And here is the strange story to go with it. You'll learn how the man who did all this work fell in love with the cathedral, spent his life on it, and after falling blind, fell from the top of it, and died at its doors. Don't touch it, kids. No, look, but no touching. -After something, ladies? -No, we're listening. Go on, only 30 francs for a small one. 40 francs for a bigger one. No, we're just looking. We're not buying. We run a stall. It's funny-looking. Is it edible? Sure. It's rock candy. -Really? -Yeah, you want to try it? It's just wax. Ah! -Are you stall runners? -Yep. We run a stall not far from here. -What are you selling? -Oilcloths. No! And how's it going? Very well. I've not sold a thing this morning. -Is that caravan back there yours? -Yeah. -Why? -It just caught our eye. -It's the nicest one at the market. -Is it luxurious? -It's a GL. -See, I told you. -You want to check it out? -What do you think? I don't mind. Yeah. Come see. -Are you leaving your stall? -It'll be fine. Come in! -It's massive! -There's enough room to skate here. It's bigger than my house. -How many of you are living here? -I'm all alone. You could get lost in here. -It must be wonderful living here. -Yeah. All mod-cons. Sorry. The kitchenette. A dining room. Small seating area. Gas central heating. Cupboards everywhere. And the bar. -See that, there's a TV. -It's incredible! -And in there? -The bathroom. -There's even a bathroom. -Look at the toilets. And at the end of the corridor, you have a bedroom. It's a real apartment. I didn't know it was this big. -Sit down and have a drink with me. -We'd like to but we can't. -You don't think? -Charlie said ten minutes. -Just a little something. -No, we must be going. That's a shame! -Who is this Charlie? -Our boss. -Bring him over, we'll have a drink. -Okay. That guy's got a way with words, eh. Come take a look, ladies and gents. Thirty francs to take home the cathedral. Chartres, the fabulous spire that has no equal, grander than all the saint and kings, as Charles Péguy once said. The greatest prayer ever made to heaven of mercy and bliss. Come closer, ladies and gentlemen. -So you sell oilcloths? -Yeah. Not everyone can sell hot air like you do. This one has a tongue on her, eh. And why not? -The idea's hard to find. -You been doing this a while? No, I did all sorts before, shoes, ready-made clothes, trinkets, hardware, tools… One day, at an antique dealer's, I found the cathedral. He couldn't sell it. I saw it and started to think I could make money from this. I found a craftsman who made miniatures. It's been with me for ten years. In the summer, I visit the D-Day beaches, Lourdes, Lisieux. It's great business. -Is that true? -What? The story about the mason. Of course it isn't. I've never set foot in Chartres! -Are you new to this work? -They're both starting off. -Can you tell? -Well, yeah, easily. -How can you tell? -The questions you're asking. Those are some funny rings. They aren't for men. No, these are my wife's. Before she died, she made me swear to wear them. -Has she been dead long? -Last year. I bought this thing for her. When she was a kid, she dreamed of living in a caravan. She also liked this life. One day here, one day there. That's what great about it. -So, where are you going next? -We're heading back to Paris. Are you nuts? Paris has nothing left! Why don't you come with me? Where are you going? Marseilles, stopping at all the main markets. -Sounds nice. -I know no one there! What difference does that make? I'll get you on your feet. When you're ready, I'll release you in the wild. Oh yes, Charlie! Yes, let's go! Eh! Yeah? Maybe we can travel some of the road together. Cheers. -What a great Pinard. -Yeah. -What a nice guy. -He's a great conversationalist. -Yeah, a bit too much. -I think so too. You're always so negative. I think he's a nice guy. -How did he buy his caravan? -He said his work paid for it. That might be. It would be nice to have one like that. If it works, we could buy a second-hand one. I know a guy who fixes them and sells them for a fair price. That sounds good! We'd decorate it nicely, with pretty curtains. We could have a color TV, like him. -If it works, maybe in six months. -Imagine arriving in Paris with it! Roger and Jacky's faces! We could even go on holiday with it. -Where would we go? -How about Italy? Or the Italian riviera. It's amazing, I hear. The Italians,bella signorina, bellissima… Those Italians are real gropers. You have to watch yourself. Let's hurry! Look! We're going to make a loss today. -How many left? -About 15. -How much is it? -15 francs per meter. And five, 20. Thank you, miss. -What are you looking for, madam? -It's for my grandchildren. They have a lovely home. Something fun and youthful would suit them. -For a kitchen table? -Yes. I've just the thing. -What do you think of this one? -It's nice. -Huh? 140 long. You want both of them? -How much is it? -I'll sell them to you for 30 francs. -That's not too bad. Here, madam, have them both. Take of those. The lady wants them both. What's going on over there? Which one? -Whichever. -All of it. 15 francs per meter. 140 long. -And for you, madam? -Yes, please. -And there you go. -Thank you. Come take a look, ladies and gents. You are listening to Johann Sebastian Bach's sonata in B flat major. What are you talking about? It's Handel's "Messiah". There's no B flat major sonata. -Get lost, you old fart. -Yes, but… Chartres, the greatest spire ever to be raised, the greatest jewel in the French religious world. Come take a look, ladies and gents. Come take a look. Some days it goes like clockwork. I never thought they'd sell so well. I sold 60 in the morning alone. That's never happened. -Why did you only bring that many? -This is unheard of. I was supposed to go back to Paris, damn it! -I need to get back there. -No way! You're a funny one. You know we need stock? I'm off to Bressuire. They can stay with me, and you come find us tomorrow evening. -What do you think? -We could try this. I go with Charlie, and you can stay with the gentleman. Do as you please. I'll tell you my name. It's Tony. Okay, Tony. -Let's meet at Bressuire tomorrow. -Yeah, at the stagecoach. About 8:00 am. At the cafe opposite the station. -How does that sound? -Sure. Okay. They're nice girls. Always agreeable. Say, come have a look. You wouldn't mind lending me 2,000 francs until tomorrow? -You don't mind staying with him? -I don't know him, though. -You've nothing to worry about, he's nice. -Why don't you stay? I'm not going to leave Charlie. And you'll sleep in the caravan. If I stay, it'll be for that. -You coming, girls? -Where to? -To have lunch nearby. -Sounds great! Josyane was not comfortable staying alone with him. She doesn't risk anything. He's got a big mouth, but he's a nice guy. Weird that he asked for money to repair his caravan. -What do you mean? -He asked for 2,000 francs. -And you gave it to him? -I did. Are you crazy? He said he felt embarrassed and that he needed the cash. What a cheek. You looking for someone? Yes, a tall man and a young blonde. -You're not Charlie, are you? -I am. -This was left for you. -It's Josyane's writing. I'm really in love. Tony is a great guy. We're meeting someone on the coastline. See you on Sunday, at noon, by a fountain in Aix. It's called the Quatre Dauphines fountain. She's crazy! -What's up? -Read it. -The morons! -They could have waited. He was meant to return my money. She's totally crazy. What's got into them? They're nuts. When did you get this letter? The young lady handed it to me at 2:00 am. Okay. Thank you. Bressuire, Bressuire. They must have gone towards Limoges. -Come on. -What do you want to do? -Come. -Can you catch up to them? Don't think I'll let them get away so easily. So, my little sweetheart, happy to see the coast? Oh, yes. -You've never been. -No. You'll see. It's great. There's a ton of money to be made. -How old are you? -Nineteen. -And your cousin? -Twenty. I'm old enough to be your father, you know. -How old are you? -42. -I'm old, right? -Not really. You're very sweet. Ah… There. That's much better. -It's no use. We won't find them. -He's crazy. First impressions are always the best. If her mother and father find out, I won't hear the end of it! He must has made a run for Montluçon. She's so sentimental. It's ridiculous. We should never have left her with him. What are we going to do? First, make some money. We need it. And Saturday, we'll go get her. -What are we doing? Sleeping here? -As you wish. -You're not hungry? -A little. They might still be serving food here. What a stupid idea, leaving her alone with that guy. Look at that guy! Say, gorgeous, go grab me some olives. -Where are they? -In the fridge, on the right. Hey. Isn't this nice, my little kitten? Damn it, be more careful! Sorry. How long were you married? Eighteen years. -And was your wife pretty? -Yes, very. A beautiful brunette in great shape, with huge tits. Not like you, my girl. Why don't you have any kids? She didn't want any. You want some? You're very curious, aren't you. Do you think I could make you forget her? Of course, my little dove. -They're not here. -What time is it? -Ten to midday. -There's no rush, she said noon. They're not going to show. -I don't understand. -I understand perfectly. -Maybe they broke down. -So? She could have hitch-hiked. She's in his clutches and can't find a way out. -You think? -Of course, why else wouldn't she show? Where could they be? -They could be working on their tans. -Maybe. They were going to the coast. We're not driving the whole coastline to find them! -Shouldn't we wait a little more? -We've been here seven hours. I'm surprised at her. He's the one who stopped her coming, I'm sure of it. She's not the one to blame. What are we going to do, then? We'll carry on alone. What else can we do? Come on. She's going to get such a telling off. Her dad's a real brute. Oh, Jacky! We've been looking for you for eight days. We spent about 500 francs on fuel. It's nice of you to come. Your parents want us to take you home. -And Josyane? Where's she? -On the road with a guy. -Since when? -About ten days. -Where to? -I don't know. She suggested meeting in Aix but never showed. She's nuts! -Who's the dude in the truck? -That's Charlie. -He your new boyfriend? -Are you crazy? Jacky… -Roger. -Nice to meet you. Hello. Hi. -You get my letters? -Yeah. -Cigarette? -No thanks. Why did you disappear like that? It was Josyane's idea. She thought you'd try and stop us. And what about the guy she's with? He's a stall-runner, with a caravan. She's going to get a telling off. Her dad'll be furious. He must be a real asshole, right, Charlie? For sure. -You know where they might be? -On the coast. Not sure where. They told us they were heading to the coast. -Are we going? -If you want. You'll never find them. Don't go anywhere. Shall we take you, Guislaine? No. -As you wish. And your parents? -I'll write to them. If you find Josyane, bring her back. You bet we'll take her back. Her olds are seriously pissed. We need to bring at least one of them back… -You didn't want to go with them? -No. They're nice though, right? Yeah, they seem like a laugh. -Are you going? Where you headed? -Down towards Alès. Thank you. -Where are we going now? -We're going up to Valence. What's up? Hey… Are you worried about Josyane? I know. Come on. It's okay. Come on, let's go. Goodbye. We'll spend the night here. -Good evening, miss. -Good evening. -You don't have a room, do you? -We do. You're in luck. I was about to shut in five minutes. Let me show you. -Is this alright? -Perfect, thank you. Could we have two grogs? Nice and warm, please. Of course. You get undressed and in bed. I'll go get the grogs. Here. And yours? I'll have mine downstairs. I need to fill in the paperwork. Sleep tight. Tomorrow morning you can stay in bed. -We aren't opening the stall? -You need your rest. No! Charlie. Charlie? Yes? I'd like to go home. Where to? To Paris. Why? I don't know, I've got a bad feeling. The stalls aren't your thing anymore, eh? I want to go home. As you wish. What will you do when you get home? You going back to hairdressing? Definitely not. What will you do, then? I don't know. Don't worry about it. You've got your life ahead of you. You're pretty, and you have your parents. They don't understand a thing. Money's all that counts for them. When I say I want a job I like, they call me lazy. And you? Are you going to keep selling at markets? I don't know. I'll see how it goes. I always land on my feet somehow. -You'll come see me, right? -Yes, of course. -We can stay friends, right? -Sure. Go on, eat your tart. Is it good? Yes, delicious. -Stop! -What is it? -I think it's Josyane. -What? Where? There, in the shelter. -It is her! -What is she doing there? What are you doing here? I want to die. Die! There, there. You didn't see the guys? No. You can't imagine. You couldn't imagine. Shush… I can't… I can't! Come, let's get back in the car. -He didn't even leave me a dime. -That bastard! You have no idea what he did to me. He was never married. Never. The caravan isn't even his. You'll tell us everything later. Come now, it's all over. You'll never see your money again, Charlie. Never! It doesn't matter. Come now, don't cry. I bet you haven't eaten in a while. When was the last time you ate? -Yesterday morning. -My, oh my. Let's go grab a nice big breakfast, and then you'll feel a lot better. Okay? -Okay. -Come on, don't cry. And then, what do we do? Are we going back to Paris? Come now. You'll be okay. We'll find him soon enough. And we'll give him a big nose! Heh! One as big as a cathedral!
