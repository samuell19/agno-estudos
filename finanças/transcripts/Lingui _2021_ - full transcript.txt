"THE SACRED BONDS" Amina! Amina! Amina! I'd like another one. How much is it? 6,000? Lower the price a bit. Hello, brother. Yes? - Want a stove? - I just bought two. So, make it three. Sorry, you're too late. Nice and slowly. Hold on. - Okay? - There. Want me to help you? You've nearly sold the lot. The day's not over, Bintou. There you go. Nice and easy. Listen to this. What do you think? Bintou... - Dancing all night wasn't enough? - No. Hello. - How much? - 3,000 francs. - 2,000? - No, 3,000, ma'am. I'll pay 2,000. It's my best price. I'll take 2,000. Put it in the car, I'll get your 2,000. Mamita. Are you okay, daughter? How was school? I bought some crickets. Want some? Why won't you talk to me? Don't call me Mamita. Did I upset you somehow? Patience! What's wrong, daughter? Leave me be, I'm tired. I want to sleep. - Don't you want to eat? - No. God protect you, daughter. Sleep well. Brahim! Amina! How are you? I was thinking of you. Liar. I never see you, neighbor. Whenever I come round, there's never anyone home. Neither you, nor Maria. Is she well? Maria's fine. Good. The money you lent me. - Thanks. - Thank you. I'll go. Amina, just a minute. I need a word. - About? - Come inside, please. Can't you tell me here? Come on, please. - Really, Brahim... - Come on. So, what can't you say outside? How long have we known each other? Seven or eight years? No, ten years. Since joining the imam's brotherhood, remember? We're siblings in religion. Siblings in religion can marry one another. Do you love me? Everyone scorns you because you're a single mother. But I don't care. I'll love you and your daughter. I'll give you a home. You need a man to protect you. We don't need protection. Do you really love me? Yes? Why weren't you at the morning prayer? I was tired and didn't wake. Tired? You can't be too tired to pray. The Qur'an says, "Prayer is better than sleep," and it's true. If you pray every day, your sins will be erased. Never miss the mosque. Yes, Imam. - Amina! - Yes? - Wait for me. - I'm in a hurry. No, no. Don't touch me. - Are you sick? - Don't touch me. What's wrong? What is it, daughter? Look at me. It's me, Mom. Don't touch me! It's Mom, Mamita. Sorry to tell you like this but... Marie is pregnant. I've expelled her. Many girls get pregnant lately and it's bad for our image. I'm sorry. Your school told me. Don't touch me. You're my mother, but know nothing! Pregnant at your age, the shame! Don't touch me! The shame! Don't touch me. Keep away from me. Tell me who the father is. I'll make him face his responsibilities. Tell me, daughter. Tell me. I want an abortion. You know we can't do that! Come here. - Muslims can't do that. - Don't touch me. In Islam, we can't do it. I don't give a damn. Leave me alone. I don't want it. Our religion forbids it. We can't do it. Leave me be. It's my body. I don't care! It's in my belly! We can't, Mamita! We can't! We can't! Maria! I'm so happy to see you. Happy birthday. - I'm all wet. - It's okay. We haven't seen you at school in ages. Sorry, I don't have a gift... That's okay. - Feeling better? - I'm fine. You're sure? You've quit school? No, I have a few problems, but I'm okay. Okay, if you say so. What'll you have? Coke? Fanta? Just water. There's champagne. No, water is fine. Okay. - Here. - Thanks. Everything okay? People are talking about you. Look, they say you're pregnant. I'm not pregnant. - Look. - I'm not pregnant! Don't you get it? Maria, wait! I'm not pregnant, okay! - Wait! - Leave me alone! Brahim! What's wrong? Maria's missing. I don't know where she is. - Did you argue? - No. - Tried calling her? - Yes, but her phone's off. Can you help me find her? Guys, there's a girl drowning! There's a girl drowning herself! Gently. Gently... Over there. That's it, here. Gently! Step back now. Step back! Go on! Are you okay? It's okay, it's okay... Girl! Girl! Can you hear me? Girl, can you hear me? Answer me, can you hear me? Answer me. Are you okay? Goodbye, ma'am. No, ma'am. I just did my duty. It's all right. I don't want to be like you, Mom. Everyone thinks you're a loose woman. No-one respects you. I don't want that life. I was expelled from school too. Because I was pregnant. Your father, the only man I've known, abandoned me. My family banished me. You're all I have, Mamita. - Did you love my father? - Passionately. I don't want to lose you, Mamita. I love you, daughter. Come here and let me hug you. I love you too, Mom. How you've grown. You're taller than me. You're a woman now. Not answering? It's Fanta, my sister. I don't know what she wants. Perhaps someone has died. You really ought to answer. Hello? No, it's her daughter, Maria. No, she isn't here. Okay, I'll tell her. Don't touch it again. Mamita... Are you okay? The law forbids it, you know. Know what I risk? Five years in jail and the loss of my license. There's nothing I can do. I'm really sorry. Doctor, please... Stop begging him, Mom! He's a man, okay? He doesn't care! He doesn't care! Mamita, sit down... We're leaving! Other people can do it. Sit down. Does your father know, Maria? My father's dead. - How old are you? - She's 15. 15... All right. - Got a million? - A million? Yes, ma'am, but not for me. For the clinic and the nurses. All right, doctor, one million. It won't be done here. But don't worry, it will go well. Please don't tell anyone. It has to stay between us, okay? - Are you okay? - Yes. That's good. Do you have problems? If you do, you have to talk. We're here to help. That's our job. If someone has problems, we try to help. We're all brothers. All brothers in Islam. It's our job. Anyone with problems can count on us. I don't have a problem. Hello. - Are you well? - Yes. - Do you have tires? - Yes. - One or two? - Show me both. Here they are. - 3,000 for the 2. - Really? Your best price? Give me 2,000. All right. Thank you. - I'll roll them for you. - Okay. Let's go. My name's Amina. My 15-year-old daughter is pregnant. I was advised to consult you. I want to save her. That's within my capabilities. It's a family trade that we've done for generations. It's what I do every day. I also do braiding, circumcisions, births... I do it all. - It happens here? - Yes, at home. Never any accidents? That's God's decision. It happens sometimes. I do it all at home. I don't do real circumcisions, I just pretend. Sit down. What are you doing? You've always dreamed of fucking me, right? What are you talking about? Give me a million and I'm yours right now. I'm serious. Amina, what's going on? Aren't you ashamed? For God's sake! Girlfriend! What's wrong? What is it? Mom? You smoke? Yes. I don't want to hide any more. What's come over you? Hello. Is anybody home? - Hello. - Hello, Maria. How are you? You're a woman now. It's time you started coming to the mosque. Understand? Is your mother here? Hello, Imam. Hello, Amina. How are you? You know I don't shake hands with women. And you give me yours! Cover your head. You've changed lately. What's wrong? You haven't been to the mosque for days. I've come to find out why. I'm too busy. Too busy? Too busy to devote time to God? You've said that once, but never repeat it. Is that clear? Find the time for the mosque. There's an important sermon tomorrow. There'll be a lot of people. You have to be there too. Understand? Goodbye. What's he after? Why does he piss us off? How are you? Darling, say hello to Auntie. What are you doing here, Fanta? Amina, you're my big sister. Your big sister's gone. You all abandoned me. Even you, Fanta. Please forgive me. Amina, you have to help me. For my daughter. Maimouna. Not my problem, Fanta. She's your niece. Just go! And our sacred bonds? Sacred bonds? There are no more sacred bonds. Go! My husband wants her circumcised. I'm against it. Fanta! I've missed you. I've missed you too. You know, I wanted to get back in touch with you, but... Dad threatened to banish me. You know how he is. I know a woman who does fake circumcisions. She'll help us. Is that true? Yes. You haven't changed a bit. You're still the same, always wheeling and dealing. You know, I'm in the shit too. I need money. How much do you need? A million. A million? Whatever for? Maria, my daughter, is pregnant. What? There's no time to lose. Here, take this. Yes, you have to take it. It's all I have. - I can't, Fanta. - You can, Amina. You really need it. - Thank you. - Only natural. Hello. Hello, Maria. Come on in. Colette, I only have 600,000. Can I pay the rest later? That's not up to me. Ask Dr Adoum. - Okay. - Follow me. - Have a seat. - Thank you. Poor girl. Is it the noise and the music? There's a concert. It's not that. I don't feel well. Okay, wait here. I'll get you a sedative. - Maria, are you okay? - Yes, doctor. - Everything all right? - Yes. Here. Take this. It's stress. It'll pass. Go to bed, you'll be okay now. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Police! Open the door! Open up! Police, open up! - The police? - It's okay. What'll happen to me? What's wrong? Trust me, we won't abandon you. Trust me. I know someone who can help you, okay? Take my number. Give it to your mother. Tell her to call me. Let's get going! Mom! Mom, let me in! Mom, open up! Mom! Go on, eat. - Hello, Amina. - Hello. Is this Maria? - Okay, Maria? - Yes. Come with me. Are you okay? I don't think I can do it. Of course you can. You know, it can go badly. It's happened before. I trust you. Come on. I trust you. Well? Well? It all went well. Thank you. Thank you. Go and rest now. I'll look after Maria. May I see her? Yes, of course. You miss Mamita, huh? Don't be sad. You miss her too? Hello. Hello, Maria. Feeling better? I've done a miscarriage certificate. For your school. Thank you. Are you okay? It was the neighbor. It was Brahim who... He raped you? Does your mother know? You should tell her. You can't keep it to yourself. Ah, you're here. Hello. Are you okay, Maria? Is something wrong? What's wrong with you both? You're like my sister now. I don't make sisters pay. Thank you. Safe journey home. - It should be this way. - I'm lost. - Know what, Mamita. - Don't call me that! Okay, I won't call you that again. We'll leave this neighborhood. Congratulations! I did it the way we agreed. Your daughter was very brave. Thank you very much.
