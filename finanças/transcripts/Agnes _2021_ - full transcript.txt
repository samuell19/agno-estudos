Although, at first I hesitated to deviate from the usual solemnity of our meal times, I had to acknowledge that tonight, indeed, should be a joyous occasion. Sister Gertrude has been with us for many years. And celebrating the birthday of a sister in Christ - summons us to- - Nun: Whores! You are whores! You are all whores of Christ! And you will fucking burn in hell! You are vain and you are lustful! And I see you! He sees you! Cocksuckers! ...your fucking God! Fuck you! Maybe ever fretting shirt of punishment give myrrh-threaded the golden folds of ease. Your scarce sheathed bones are weary of being bent. Lo, and God shall strengthen all the feeble knees. Benjamin, you remember your Hopkins. - You're looking well. - Thank you. Uh, what were you doing just now? Admiring the handiwork. Not even Solomon in his glory was arrayed as one of these. And I understand congratulations are in order. I heard you passed your exams, if only just barely. Just as you taught me. If you can't be good, be good enough. Right. Good advice for all of us. And I'm kidding, of course. Reports are you did brilliantly. How long have you been out, a semi-free man? Three weeks, Father Donaghue. I'm gonna take my vows in the spring. And then they're talking about taking me on at St. Joseph's. Perfect, Saint Joe's. God knows we could use one like you. Days like this, I think the church got it wrong with Augustine. Too much original sin. It seems more likely that we were conceived in a state of original blessing. Well, don't tell the bishop that. Oh, of course I wouldn't. Wait, the bishop? Why are you here Benjamin? Well, they called on me to fetch you, the bishops in Father Cappa's office. He's here? Jesus Christ. Fuck. And there's another priest with them, too. Tall, glasses? It's vicar general, isn't it, Father Exley? I thought this was good news. No, Benjamin, it is not good news. - It's the worst possible news. - How do you know that? Ah, Christ, and they sent you to fetch me, to humiliate me, no doubt. What are you even talking about? Just forget it. Thy will be done. Take a seat, gentlemen. Relax, Frank, it's not what you think. I assume you're familiar with a convent in the far corner of our diocese, the Carmelite Santa Theresa? - Yes. - Understand that this matter requires the utmost discretion. Of course. You have special training, I'm told. All kinds. Not so much with religious sisters. - Do you think this is funny? - Let's just cut to the chase. Two weeks ago, there was an incident with one of the sisters at Santa Teresa. An incident? You're serious? His eminence and I rarely leave the seat of the diocese. I assure you, we are absolutely serious. Does he need to be here? I don't think he's ready. Frank, just stop. They have their reasons. We'll get to that later. I have to admit, I don't understand. Be glad you don't. They're talking about the Holy Rite of Exorcism. - So, what happened? - The signs are all there, spontaneous violent outbursts, eruptions of vile blasphemy, surprising feats of strength. Their diagnoses was inconclusive. Dissociative disorder? Yes. So vague it might as well be demonic possession. What do we know about this girl? She's lived there for years. Their record's almost a blank, no family to call. No history of psychological problems, sexual abuse? None that we know about. I almost find it amusing you would ask that. This is hardly useful right now. My apologies. But what will happen is this. The two of you will drive to Santa Teresa early tomorrow, talk to the sisters, investigate this poor girl's symptoms. Stay as long as you need to. Use your... judgment. At the very least, we need to rule out the worst case scenario. Possession? Actual demonic possession? Right, you understand I don't really believe in this medieval woo-woo? You understand that you're in no position to refuse? The sisters will be expecting you. Father Cappa will help you with anything else you need. You're dismissed, Father Donaghue. Benjamin, would you stay a moment? What did... Oh. Gene, don't do this. I'm sorry, Frank. I'll talk to you tomorrow morning. This is gonna be difficult to hear. It's hard to say. He's been a good friend of mine for years, and he's done so much good for this parish. Until now. We're sending him away, far away from here, perhaps overseas. What's going on? What is the shame of the church right now? No, I don't believe it. I don't either. But accusations have been made, and he doesn't deny them. Pray for him, but keep an eye on him. We're afraid the added pressure is making him... - erratic. - Desperate. Am I gonna have to worry about... - my own welfare? - What do you mean? Am I gonna be safe with him? You're a grown man, Benjamin. You're gonna be just fine. What? Well? Sisters, get some clean laundry. Hold her down, sisters! Oh, my God! What draws so many young men to the priesthood, not so much nowadays, is this beautiful vision of service. - Yeah. - I mean, don't get me wrong, it is a beautiful vision, but it needs to be more - than that. - I know, you told me about this in class, remember? I know all this already. I just wanna be sure this comes from your heart of hearts, not from some idea of how to live a good life because you don't know what you want. Or... or you're compensating for something. Or you're scared of life. There are plenty of ways to live a good, meaningful life. I'm not scared of life. I've searched my heart, and it says become a priest. That seems courageous to me. - I pray about it a lot. - Okay, then. - Do you regret it? - No. I don't, but... but it's tough. And this is really personal, but what about chastity? - What about it? - Don't you want to get a job, make some money, meet the nice girl or guy? That'd be okay, too. I don't know what you're into. I'm not into anything. I'm taking a vow of chastity. Pancakes and sausage with a side of syrup. At the very least, know thyself before you jump into this. You got this or you want me to do it? Go for it. Bless us, O Lord and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive from thy bounty. Through Christ, our Lord. Amen. So... what do you know about exorcism? Not much. I know that it's still a holy rite, even though the church doesn't really practice it anymore. Wrong. They do. They just don't claim it. It's all very hush, hush. - Thanks for telling me. - Even if, in our current age, less people believe in God, it seems that belief in the devil is rising. Maybe that means he's winning, I don't know. It seems to me that people are just in more pain. Good. Yes. They are. And they don't know why. So they clutch at whatever reason they can find. Look, I've performed exorcisms, five or six full ones, with Father Rigazzi, who really knew the rite. But I never saw anything that convinced me a demon was actually inside someone. But I do know the exorcisms worked. The power of faith. Maybe, people needed to get sick to some other worldly or unimaginable degree and could only get well when a priest forgave them, someone ordained by God. Hmm, maybe... some people just need to walk through darkness before they even get to the light, as... as cliché as that sounds. You don't believe in demons? I'm afraid the answer is no. Our a way of life is no doubt hard. It demands rigor, discipline and strength of spirit. But, most of all, the purity of heart. But sometimes we falter. Now, understand that I have sought the Lord's guidance and deliberated hard over this decision. Two days ago, I requested help from the diocese. A priest with experience in such matters, a true man of God with the highest of reputations is now on his way to us. We will host him until he decides what must be done with Sister Agnes. I'm told he will arrive this evening. Now, it goes without saying that I expect conduct of the highest standard during this time. Remember who you are, sisters. We are not accustomed to admitting men within our walls, even holy men. So let every action reflect the dignity of your solemn vow before Almighty God. - May I ask a question, Mother? - You may not. If you have concerns, you may seek my counsel after our duties are finished. We will spend the rest of the day cleaning before Father Donaghue arrives. Sister Mary, youngest in Christ and lowliest among us, I'm told you were friends with Sister Agnes? Yes. Then your hands must be idle least of all. You will clean the chapel from floor to ceiling, removing every mote of dust. It's likely Father Donaghue will serve mass while he's here. Yes, Mother. Here, put this on. - Oh, I can't wear this. - Why not? I'm not a priest. You said at lunch your vows are all but taken. Yeah, but I haven't taken them yet. This is gonna cause problems in there. Look, sorry, Father Donaghue, there's just no way. Suit yourself. Don't say I didn't tell you. I saw Father Donaghue give mass once before the sisterhood. It was inspiring. Who's that supposed to be, his driver? Whoever he is, he's handsome. Sister, you need \ to contain yourself. I'm sorry, but he looks like a movie star. And Father Donaghue isn't bad, either. - Sister Honey! - What? We can't even talk about it? I don't see the problem. It's not like I'm going to go up to him and say, - "Oh, Father, I..." - Sister! The younger one is wearing all black, but no priest color. He's probably a deacon. I must say, I wish I was told your young companion would be accompanying you. I find it inappropriate. Almost insulting. I'm sorry, Mother Superior, I assumed - the vicar general... - Of course, Father Benoit visits us for mass three times a week, but he's 77 years old. It's unusual enough to have a priest stay overnight, let alone this young man. Again, my apologies Mother. But he is a very pious young man. And I assure you, he is absolutely essential for my work here. Then I assume we should look at this as a test of faith for all of us. Benjamin, Mother Superior is concerned... How should I put this, about having a young unordained rooster loose in the hen house. Father, there's no need to be crude. Mother Superior, I'm taking my vows later this year. I absolutely assure you, with Christ himself as my witness, I will remain a model of propriety as long as you are kind enough to host me. Well, I'll expect so, and we'll insist upon it. This is Sister Ruth. This is Sister Honey. - Thank you, Mother. - Honey? I... I believe it's Proverbs. "My son, eat the honey, for it is good. And the drippings of the honeycomb are sweet to the taste." Oh, my God, stop. Sister, that's enough. Leave them be. Have Sister Mary take their dirty things - when they're through. - Yes, Mother. And afterward, we should do what we came here to do. The sooner, the better. Mother, forgive me, one last thing. Do you happen to have any wine? "And they said of him, 'He casts out devils by the power of the devil.'" Careful, Mother. In that passage, the Pharisees are talking about our Lord. Humph. I thought you said you were interested in this going smoothly. We'll be in and out of here anyway. The inflicted sister probably just needs some priest to come and say the magic words. Don't worry. I've seen this more than a few times. What? It's Father Donaghue. It's not appropriate for you to be here. But I imagine you knew that. Forgive me, Mother. I wanted to apologize for my behavior. It was a long trip today. And I'm not accustomed to your way of life out here. I wasn't thinking, and I should've known better. You should have. I'm afraid I'm more used to dealing with lay people. Sometimes I joke with them. It puts them at ease. But here I should conduct myself with more respect, especially toward you. Well, then I must forgive you. My temper is... It's been quite a stressful time. May the Holy Spirit guide us both. Now, shall we go see about your poor lost lamb? Has she spoken at all in any ancient languages? - No, Father. - Has she said anything about any of you she couldn't possibly know? Secrets or private details, particularly those things from before you took your vows? Of course not. Likely all will be well. Follow my lead as we discussed. If you become afraid, you can't let it show. You have to be strong, but fill your hearts with love. If you see anything strange, stick to the script. You tied her up? You treat someone like an animal, they'll act like an animal. The poor girl injured herself. Oh. What's her name? Agnes. Sister Agnes. Sister Agnes, can you hear me? Can you feel me near you? This looks bad, but maybe not that bad. Benjamin, the holy water. Well, let's begin. - Lord, have mercy. - Lord, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. - Christ, have mercy. - Fuck you. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. Begone, you. Begone, seducer. Your place is in solitude. Your abode is the nest of serpents. Get down and crawl with them. You might delude man, but God cannot be mocked. Go to hell, cocksucker. It is He who cast you out, from whose sight nothing is hidden. It is He who repels you, to whose might all things are subject. Many things. Many things. Is He who expels you. He who has everlasting fire. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Oh, dear sweet sister. That was dramatic. It has to be. It's an exorcism, one of the most elaborate song and dance acts the world has ever seen. So, that was all in her head? More or less. Look, the Carmelites here in Santa Teresa belong to an entirely enclosed order. In some ways, they're more a relic of the old church than even exorcism itself. - Yeah, but if they... - That's enough heaven and hell for one night, Benjamin, let's get some sleep. I'm knackered. God sees the truth... but waits. Over 100 years ago, Leo Tolstoy wrote a story with that title. And it has always stuck with me. I find that so many of us who devote our lives to God through our vows, spend a great deal of time waiting. Waiting on God. It can be so easy to fall into despair in this fallen world. How could we know this gift, the glory of salvation, of finding our way to Christ, if at first we did not wander? How could we ever truly appreciate the miracle of redemption and grace if we'd not suffered tribulation and come to darkness? I haven't met all of you, but the Mother Superior tells me that you are a pious and devoted bunch. And I am truly grateful for the hospitality that you've shown us during this time of trial, to me and my strapping young buck of a companion. Isn't he handsome, ladies? But there is one among you who I am most pleased to have become acquainted with, one who has suffered much, walking through a darkness that most of us cannot even imagine, one who has endured a true test of faith. God sees the truth, but waits. And he can always see a heart that is fundamentally pure, as I know hers is. Okay, Sister Honey. What say you, dear sister, are you ready to join us in the Lord's sacrament? We must be patient. Understandably, our dear sister will take some time to return to her former self. Well, aren't you just the sweetest old liar? What? Father Frank, he touched my wee-wee. Father Frank, he touched my wee-wee! So, should we call the diocese? Absolutely not. - Well, the rite didn't work. - You've made this worse - by your pride. - Obviously, that was not my doing, Mother. It ambushed us. So, it's an it now? What she said about the child, how could she know that? I thought everybody knew about that. I have never seen anything like this before in my life. I thought you were supposed to be the expert. They were setting me up to fail. - Sister! - I'm sorry, Mother. We have to call the diocese. You don't want that kind of attention here right now. And it's not needed. I know someone who can help us. - We served in Rome. - You mean a priest? Kind of. Cross Talk with Guy Chesterton. No matter your religious beliefs, you're probably familiar with the old adage giving the devil his due. Well, our guest this evening can be said to have done all that and more, tracing an unlikely career path through decades of macabre service, casting out alleged demons, possibly saving souls, and becoming a household name in the process. We're pleased to welcome Father Henry Black in the studio with us this evening. - Welcome, Father Black. - Well, thank you, Guy, that was quite an introduction. It's good to be with you. Now, your methods are said to be quite different from the Catholic church, not to mention from the way we've seen exorcism represented in the media and on films. It's true you were ex-communicated from the Church over 17 years ago. Never looked back. Hmm. Now, I'm sure they miss me just about as much as I miss them. Let's go back to the beginning. When did you learn you had a talent for this kind of thing? When I was a child, my little sister was possessed by a demon named Bune. You were involved in exorcisms from a very early age. No, Bune, he was a stubborn demon. He wouldn't get out. So, you're saying a demon named Bune infiltrated your sister's body years ago, and to this day resides in your family's home? - Correct. - And all this can be verified? It took some getting used to. But growing up, I was forced to adapt to the ways of the demon Bune. I grew accustomed to interacting with him on a daily basis. So, by the time I got my collar, I already had all the know-how I needed to exorcise anything you put in front of me. And yet, with all your experience, you were never able to exercise the demon Bune - from your sister. - It's complicated, Guy. I mean, the family, at this point, had become so familiar with Bune. He still lives with my family, still eats at the table, still sleeps in what used to be my sister's room, family vacations and whatnot. His favorite color is green. His favorite dessert is lemon chiffon cake. What do you say to those who claim you're simply exploiting the families you visit and capitalizing on the mental illness of the so-called possessed? Let me put it to you this way, Guy. I didn't choose this line of work. It chose me. God chose me. He put me on a path of darkness. He put a demon by my side and said, "Be not afraid, my son." We'll be right back. She's given herself over to the devil. She needs medical attention. Sisters, you forget yourselves. As if we don't have enough to do. Sister Honey, find out if Father Donaghue has stopped bleeding. If so, clean and dress his wound. Yes, Mother Superior. You two, finish cleaning the filth that Agnes has trailed from the chapel. Go. You, prepare a light meal to be served to the rest of the sisters in half an hour. We will gather our strength, after which we will retire to our rooms and we will pray for the rest of the evening. - Do I make myself clear? - Yes, Mother. Sister Mary, Sister Ruth, she's quiet, yes? She hasn't stirred since the straps or the holy water. Then go. Sister Mary, since you two were thick as thieves, you will attend Agnes, or whatever holy remains in her. We might still call her by that name. I can't see her. You're frightened, child? You don't have the luxury to be frightened. - Yes, Mother. - And mind, if she speaks evil, don't listen. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women. And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death, amen. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women. And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour f our death, amen. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women. And blessed is the fruit - of thy womb, Jesus. - Mary! - Holy Mary, Mother of God... - Go home! ...pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, amen. - Hail Mary full of grace... - Praise Jesus! Blessed is the fruit of thy... Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us now and at the hour of our death, amen. Holy Mary, Mother of God, please pray for me. Hey, Mary. Hey, Agnes. Are you afraid of me? You bit off Father Donaghue's nose. Well, he had a nice nose. I wish I'd said goodbye to everyone before I left, told them how much I loved them. But I guess that doesn't matter now. Aren't you uncomfortable? What do you mean? Come on, take that shit off. There, isn't that better? You and I have never really been honest with each other, have we? You lost someone. - Yeah. - I lost someone, too. The love of my life. He was my teacher. He could make me laugh like no one else could. But I was stupid and I lost him. Paul Satchimo. You loved him? And he loved me. You lost your son. The only person I ever loved. You have to bury the dead, Mary. I'll always be with you. I beseech you now for guidance, Lord, you whose righteousness has always breathed through this convent like the sweetest song. How is this wretchedness come to pass upon us? Is my service not pleasing to you? What? - What's it? - I'm sorry, Mother. For a great many things, I'm sure. I think you should go see Agnes. What are you talking about? The devil is in her. Has it gotten into you as well? I don't think it's the devil. She was kind to me. The devil leads with kindness. And why are you not presentable? There are men in this house, you slut. Leave! Do you want me to pray with you? No, Benjamin, just leave me to the wolves. Maybe a priest without a nose won't seem so strange in... Vietnam or Croatia or wherever the hell it is - they're gonna be sending me. - That's it, think positive. I am thinking positive. I'm positively fucked. Yeah. Father Black will be here in the morning. Well, that should be interesting. I am fucked. I am fucked, I'm fucked, I'm fucked. Frank. Good to see you again. So what happened there, Frank, somebody spite your face a little bit? Yeah, something like that. Father Black, I would like to introduce you to Benjamin, one of my best students. Father Henry Black and his lovely assistant. I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. - I didn't disclose. - Right. Pleased to make your acquaintance. You should be ashamed of yourself. - Who's this guy? - I'm sorry. We've been under considerable stress in our current predicament. - Benjamin, if you... - Boy's right. This is not the sort of company I'd ever allow in this convent, no matter what the circumstance. You absolutely cannot smoke here. You know, I can sense when I'm not welcome, Frank. I appreciate the call - after so long, but... - No, no, no, no. - Come on, let's... - Please, Henry, please. The fact is that we are in dire need of your expertise. That's probably true. Mother, you and the sisters in your cherished convent have been the most gracious hosts. But now I have a request. Respectfully, would you give it a rest? - Excuse me? - Forgive us, Mother. - This is highly inappropriate. - At this juncture, I don't see that you have any other choice. Please escort us to Agnes so that we can end this dance once and for all. I most certainly will not. Very well, then. If you will follow me, I would love to introduce you to the poor girl, and you can commence your work. Oh, what the hell? I drove this far. I'll be notifying the bishop. I am curious. Hello there, Agnes. Wow, shows some good instinct because I'm not your friend. I'm not your friend at all. No, ma'am. Let me ask you something. Do you feel like you're welcome here? Is that what's going on? You feel like you're welcome? Because I've looked around. You're in a convent. So... so, you're not welcome here. Which means that you and I, well, we're gonna have to... have this little talk, aren't we? You're a disgrace. Well, you can sweet talk me all you want, but I'm not scared. Fuck you, cocksucker. Oh! Yeah, you can't bruise name with your words, either. I've been to all nine levels of hell and back. Hell wouldn't have you. Well, you see, that's... that's where you're wrong because I have escorted several there myself. I think I'm starting to like you. Well that's, that's sweet. Let me tell you something. Come here, let me tell you something. I love you. You love me? I do. I love you. And you know who else loves you? No. - Jesus Christ! Get out, demon! - Stop, no! No! - Time to go! You hear me? - No, stop, please! - The power of Jesus Christ... - I'm sorry! - ...our true Lord and Savior... - No, no! - ...compels you! - No! No! - And I say begone! - I'm so sorry! - Begone! - I'm sorry! I'm sorry! - This has to stop now! - Just wait! Child of God, for it is He who commands you! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! What just happened? What just happened? It's all right, my child. You're safe now. I don't understand, I... I could... I could see, like, I could feel. It was like, it was like I was another person. Yeah, well, you were, you were in the grips of a creature most foul. But it's okay, you're safe now. You see, folks, that's the way the cookie crumbles. You see, if you'd have let me have my camera crew in here, we could've documented some history. - Nice work, Henry. - Thank you, Frank. Father Black, thank you. No, there's no need to thank me. No, I want to thank you. But I have to tell you, I'm afraid. Well, there's nothing to be afraid of. Maybe not for me. - Well, what do you mean? - It's not me I'm afraid for. I don't understand. It's you. Oh, goddammit, son of a bitch! Please, praise me! God! Please, please! God! Somebody help me! Aren't you going to do something? Help! God damn you! Yeah, we're good. Hey, Wanda, do you know if our paychecks are ready? Oh, I don't know. Go ask Curly. He's in the back. - How are you doing? - All right. Good. Come. Hey, I was wondering if my paycheck was ready yet? Yeah, sure, sure, sure. You're... You're that new girl, huh? What was your... what was your name again? - I'm terrible with that stuff. - It's okay. Uh, Mary. Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary. Mary Jane, Mary Jane. There we go, I got you. All right, here, there you go. - Thank you, sir. - Yeah. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just call me... call me Curly, all right? Today your day off? Yeah, I'm working a double tomorrow. Oh, nice. Well, you enjoy your day. Yeah, you too. Used to be a nun, huh? - Yeah, I was. - Golly. I've always wanted to meet a nun. Well, I'm sure I've met enough for the both of us. I bet you have. I bet you have. That's good. That's good. Hey, listen, I'll be the first tell you that I don't for fraternizing with the employees here, but since you're new in town, if you ever wanted to, you know. I'm out and about a lot. I don't know if you like to drink or if you like wine. I like wine. I like... I like other stuff, too. So... When was the last time you went out with somebody? I don't know. I guess you got all kinds of stuff just stirring up inside you. Yeah, well, you just think about it. You know where to find me. Hey, enjoy your day off. Thank you. Later, girl. Now, take care. Thank you so much. Hi, how can I help you? I just need to cash this check. Sure. You have a checking account with us? I don't. Do I need one? Yes. In order to cash your check, you do. Yeah. Okay. Does it cost anything? It's $25, but we have great benefits. - Twenty-five? - Twenty-five, yes. You have a good day. It seems I remember doing this before, only then I didn't have so far to fall. Where are you now, Martin? He brought by his dog thinking I would babysit. I mean, now what kind of lazy SOB would think that I would take care of his dog? Just crazy son of a... There you go. You have a good day. I sure like that tie and that pink shirt. Looks good. Oh. Hey, Mary, - could you do me a favor? - What? Curly's yapping about some spill on aisle four. Would you clean it up for me? Please? I mean, my back is just killing me. I've been standing here - for four hours. - Okay, fine. Fine. I'll watch your register. What the fuck are you talking about? This is not the plan, all right? He was drunk off the booze you made. - Okay? - Oh, so it's my fault? - Yes. - Listen, I have bills to pay. You have a bill to pay. He fucking gets drunk and takes advantage of you? Go to hell, Curly. How are you doing today, - Sister Mary? - I'm good. I just got off work and I'm gonna go meet some friends. Please, if you want anything, just help yourself. Well, I ain't gonna trouble you none. I just... I just need a moment of your time, if that's okay with you. You got a little bit of time? Yeah. Is everything okay? Nah, nothing like that. You being a nun and all, when you came looking for a place, well, you know, I gave you a special deal. And I appreciate it a lot. I really do. Ah, it was nothing. It feels good to help, it does. But well, my wife, Ona, she gets bent out of shape a lot. But you gotta understand, she's a juice head. Been that was for as long as I can remember. And when she caught wind of me helping out another young woman and... Well, she got ideas. - Is there something that... - Hold on now. I done told her wasn't nothing going on between us, but that don't mean she listened. See, we have a history that stretches far and wide across this city. And I done quit drinking, understand, I don't touch this stuff. This ain't my doing, but anyhow, I'm afraid I'm going to have to break our promise. I know I told you I needed 450 for this place. But in order to be fair to the other tenants, be fair to Ona, I'm going to have to ask for 600. Six hundred dollars? I'm real sorry. It ain't like me to promise one thing and then take it back. Right. It's just $600 is a lot of money. My job doesn't pay very much. It's tough all over, Sister Mary. I'm gonna give you the number of another young woman named Evonne. She works up at the laundromat. She's always looking for help. It ain't much, but maybe it'll help you get over the hump, won't put you out much. The work's easy. - Hello, sisters. - Sister Mary. Aww! You look wonderful. We just wanted to see how you were doing. I'm fine. But how are you? Good. So, you are living in this town? Yeah, I got an apartment near here not long ago. What a coincidence. We're only a few stops up the bus line at Villa Lucia. It must be part of God's plan. - Do you like it? - Oh, yes. But it's very different than Santa Teresa. - It's a convent in the city. - Can you imagine? After Sister Agnes was put away and Mother Superior laid to rest... ...the diocese thought it best to relocate all of us. And the new order is very different. So, what have you been up to? Well, I got a job. You're so brave. I always said that you were the brave one. Didn't I always say that about Sister Mary, Sister Ruth? Yes, she always did say that about you. And also that you were pure of heart. I did. I did. I did. We understand better than anyone how difficult it must've been for you to leave the convent the way that you did. And we want you to know we have your best interest at heart, but we feel that... Listen, we understand, we really do. What happened was traumatizing, to say the least. We want you to know we have your best interest - at heart. - Traumatizing for everybody. Traumatizing. The Church not only lost Santa Theresa, I heard it was sold last month, but Father Donaghue as well. That brave and gentle man. - What happened to him? - He disappeared. No one has seen him since. We know that it's been a lot to deal with, and we respect your choice. But we would also like to extend our welcome if you wanted to join us at Villa Lucia. Sister Honey, Sister Ruth, I appreciate you reaching out, but after all we've been through, it just felt right to put everything behind me. We understand that. But may I ask you a question, Mary? - Is it about Agnes? - No. Do you still carry the faith? I don't know. I keep a crucifix on the wall in my apartment and I pray sometimes, but I don't know what it all means anymore. I mean, now that I'm back in the real world, my time at the convent feels like a dream. I keep asking for God to guide me and... I hear nothing back. Did you know among our other duties in the new order, we service the poor. Yes, our soup lines are very popular. Hey, I got this. Thanks. I'm gonna go clock out. - You all right? - Yeah. Yeah. Hey, whoa. Who's taking over your shift? It's Wanda. She's out there now. Can't be Wanda. I done fired Wanda. - No, I didn't know. - Yeah, well, there's a lot you don't know about. Especially what goes on back here. I don't know. I noticed you've been picking up a lot of double shifts. You're a worker. Not like these other girls that, they don't care about getting ahead. - My rent just went up. - Yeah, I know your rent just went up. And I get it. I get it. We all got stuff like that in our lives. Let me ask you something. This job, all the double shifts, the back-to-backs, is it gonna be enough? We'll see. Yeah, we'll see. How about this? How about I give you a little extra cash. Then when I need a favor, - I can call on you. - No, thank you. "No, thank you"? I appreciate it. But I can't take that. My money's not good enough for you? I'd just like to make it my own way. Yeah, I can respect that. I'm going to get you one of these days. I better go back up front. Yeah, go on. So, you're Earl's friend? Yeah. I'm his tenant. Mm-hmm. He's really nice. Oh, I'll bet he is. Lady, if you don't know the difference between a meatball and a matzo ball, I cannot help you. Anyway, please give it up for my good friend, the great Paul Satchimo, ladies and gentlemen. Paul Satchimo. Hey, everybody. You know what I've noticed? Not everybody's trying. You ever notice that? Okay, I saw a guy on the sidewalk yesterday, he was pushing a shopping cart full of newspapers, wearing pink stretch pants. He was trying. He went to the bank to get a loan. They weren't trying at all. I went to this bar back here to cash in my two drink limit, and, man.. ...they weren't trying either. So, now here I am, up here trying, dead sober. Okay. Check this out. Some people are trying, some people aren't trying. Some people aren't even trying to try. But some people are trying to not try. And some people are trying to try not trying. Hey, if I thought that could work, I might try it. Anyway, what do you guys want to talk about? Money? Jobs? I had a regular type job once, I did. I was a cold caller selling restaurant quality meats at wholesale prices. I was not very good at it. One night... Yes, one night... victory. I sold 25 pounds of New York strips all across the greater metropolitan area. My name topped the sales board. I rose from my cubicle like a champion as my colleagues watched with... with, um... with envy, and disdain because they knew... ...that I had been chosen by the team leader, Mark, to enter the inner sanctum, the deep freeze, the deep freeze which held a cornucopia of frozen meat products. And as I stood there, gazing into the... the glistening vista of frozen meats, Mark said to me and I quote, "Pick anything you want." Anyway, that's it. That's the story. It's not really a joke, I guess. It's really more just a 38-year-old man sitting alone in his apartment, eating three pounds of sausage. You know what, that sausage didn't make me happy. Things, things do not make people happy. Do you know what does make people happy? Do you know? Connection. Us, connecting in this room, right now. Forget about the sausage. It's an electricity. Do you feel it? - Right now, it's happening. - It's us. We're communicating with one another. That's where real happiness comes from. I don't know. Anyway, what else you guys want to talk about? Frozen meats. Hey, hey, hey. What is so funny? People are complaining. That's what I thought. Would you calm the fuck down? I'm sorry. Jesus Christ. It can't compare to the nonsense, She started saying things. And concentrate on the things you can handle. Sometimes, I gotta pray for strength. Like the good book says, "Like a dog returneth to its vomit, so a fool repeats his foolishness." Mary, are you even listening to me? Hi. Do you need any help? Um, no, I don't think so. I just came in here to... Wait, what do people come in here to do? Um, I can show you how the machines work. I think I got it, but thank you. No problem. Okay, well. Yeah, just let me know if you need anything. Sure. - Who's that? - He's a comedian. He don't look funny. Is he funny? Yes. He's a comedian. - Oh, hey. - Hi. Am I not allowed to smoke out here? It's fine. Cool. You never know these days. I saw your show. Oh, okay. Well, no wonder. Well, thanks for coming. So, what did you think? Of the show? Yeah. Did you laugh? - No. - Huh! Everyone's a critic. It wasn't my best night. But I laughed later. Well, I guess that's something, the slow burn kind of a thing. Of course, the point is to laugh during the show. That's kind of the idea, I guess. Hell, I dunno. You know what? Laugh when you wanna laugh. It's a free country. I knew Agnes. Excuse me? I was in the convent with Agnes before she left. Oh. Wow. She was in love with you. You look nice. I have to say I haven't even heard her name in... I don't know, it's been awhile. You must've known her pretty well. We had talks. Not a lot, but the ones we had were important. She was incredible. And do you know where she is now? You mentioned she left the convent. She's in a different place now. What do you mean? I don't want to talk about it. I understand. I always wondered about her, to be honest. The minute that things got hard between us was the minute she gave up. And I never bought into any of her religious horseshit, by the way. I'm sorry if I offend, but I... I couldn't understand why she went to such great lengths for her salvation. Anyway, we were young. I... I didn't usually make a habit of dating my students, but I, you know, in that case I made an exception. How long have you been a funny man? A what? I guess, I don't know, I've always been funny. I, uh, I was funny when I was a kid, started putting an act together when I was like 19, and I should probably be farther along in my career than I am, but... But you're comfortable? You like who you are? Yeah, I think so. I... I make just the right amount of money and I... I'm happy living life the way that I do. I don't, I don't need fame or fortune. I do what I love. How about you? What's your story? Why did you leave the convent? That was Agnes, really. She convinced me there was maybe more to life outside the Church. So, what do you think? I don't think either of us ever belonged there. Is there anything you're passionate about? Anything at all? I don't know. The only thing I ever worked hard for was becoming a sister. Well, geez, Mary, that's about the saddest thing I ever heard. Can I ask you a personal question? Have you ever felt love outside of God? Hey, Paul, don't mind us. We just been here a few hours. Are you gonna introduce us to your friend? Oh, sorry. Peter, Evelyn, Pedro. This is Mary. Nice to meet you. He's the best. I always say he's the best. Anyway, here we are. You can feel free to make yourself at home. I don't know, have a seat or whatever you do. I'll be right back. I like your place. Thank you. You were the funniest man? - Like in the world? - What's that? Oh, that? Yeah. That was many years ago. Who's the funniest man now? Um... I actually don't know. Do you like music? I used to. Okay. You read a lot. Books. Oh, yeah. Well, as I said, I used to teach. There was a time... I can't say that I really have the focus to just... to just sit and read a book. I haven't for a while. I don't know what happened there. What do you do now? You mean to take the place of reading? Um... I don't know. I guess I drink. I have to say, I don't know why I'm being so honest with you. I know that we just met, and I... I don't know. Well, you're not... you're not the usual sort of woman that I associate with. You asked me a question in the bar before your friends came. Yeah. I asked you if you'd ever been in love before. The answer is yes. When I was really young, I got pregnant. Back then, I was a different kind of person. I don't even remember the conception or who the guy was. Anyway, I decided to keep the baby. And it was like... a whole new window opened up on my life. I loved my son with everything I had. I loved the way he laughed. I loved to hear him cry when I left the room. I loved the color of his cheeks and his stupid little teeth. I was even... starting to love God. Then, one day, God took my son away and left me with nothing. I prayed. I begged God to tell me why. - And he said... - What'd he say? He said nothing. I don't know what lives there in that nothingness now. But he just... he put a spell on me. What is the matter with you? Oh, I'm sorry. Stop fucking laughing, then. I'm sorry. No, I'm really sorry. - Why did you do that? - I'm really sorry. My face! I have a show tomorrow night! - Are you sick or something? - No, please. No. Just... just leave, okay? Come on. Just... Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death, amen. Dear God, please listen to me, please listen to me. Please, I beg you. I beg you. I'll do anything you want me to. Please just talk to me. Please just show me, show me, please. Excuse me. Yes, I know it's a big diocese, but someone in your office has to know who I'm talking about. He was around the tragedy at the Santa Teresa convent. I was a sister there. Okay. Yes. Okay. I can hold on, but I am at work. - What the fuck are you doing? - It's an emergency. Crazy bitch. Hello? Okay, hold on. What the fuck is wrong with you? You're sure that's the right number? Thank you. You're fired. You're fired! You think you might be possessed? That's serious. No, not really, I guess. You shouldn't joke about that. I think I just remember Agnes. Were you two close? Yes. Yes, we were. We had a good conversation right before she, uh... you know. Anyway, she helped me rethink my life. That's great. I never would've guessed that about her. So, how's it going? Oh, I don't know. I just walked out on my job, so.... You know, after what happened at Santa Teresa, the Church would probably put you up for a few months if you can't make rent. Thanks, but I'll figure it out. I'll call you again if I can't. Now, I'm told your former sisters invited you to join them at Villa Lucia. Do you think the life of a religious could appeal to you again? I don't think so. It's different than Santa Teresa. It's less confined. But if you no longer hear the call. Maybe not then. Well, maybe not. A wise man once taught me it's not something you should try to fake. So, can you think of any other work you'd be passionate about? No. You, uh... Oh, never mind. What? It can't be that bad. I had a son. He died. Just now, I was thinking how much I would've liked him to grow up and be like you. And that's way too much. No, it's not. It's just, um... my mother died. I was 11. So, that means a lot. Can I ask you a spiritual question? Yeah, of course, it's my job. I hope I can answer it. How do we know God? Well, there's scripture. And there's a few thousand years of church teaching. I'm not talking about any of that. I'm talking about contact, connection. How do we know God? How do you know God? - In this world? - Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'll try. Just remember, I haven't been a priest very long, so. All right. Let's take this sandwich. We're hungry and it's all we've got, but let's look at it. First, there's this terrible crappy bread you've got to get through. And that's most of it, really. It's so much bread, this starchy, substandard awfulness, this filler. Most of this sandwich, most of this world, just a bunch of junk to chew through, hoping that it ends soon. Then you got flavorless tomatoes, this wilted lettuce. Cheese looks like death. Sauce, if you had a jar of it, you'd probably die. But hidden within all this sound and fury is a thin sliver of meat. And that's the stuff we really came here for. Right? You can imagine a better sandwich, a better world... I know I can. More fulfilling, with more meat. Just like you can imagine more good people when you've met one really good one, you know? Okay. So for Christians, at least, that one really good person who brings out the best in you, makes you want to bring out the best in other people, that's Christ. And if you look hard enough, he's in this world. He's the meat in the sandwich, this stuff we'd realize we were really hungry for if we knew ourselves like God knows us. Because Christ is God incarnate, and carne means meat, flesh. You know, he comes to us in a form that we can recognize, God in a meat suit like us. God con carne. But to know him in this world, to really know him, you have to deal with the whole sandwich. And if you chew through it, and you keep a pure heart, you can know God, taste God. You just ate God. Well, he invites us to. That's the sacrament. Take this, my body, and eat of it. He invites us to the feast. And it's a gift freely given. And as long as we're willing to open our hearts. When I open my heart, it just hurts. That's right. I think you know. Something has to go out of you. To make room for the spirit to come in. We get there by loss. That's what spiritual hunger is. And joy can follow, too, if we let it. Like we have to say goodbye to the people we love, the people we care about. I'm afraid so. Hopefully not too soon. But no one can ever actually say goodbye, right? No.
