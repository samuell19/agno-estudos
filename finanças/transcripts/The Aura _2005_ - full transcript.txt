Wait a minute, it doesn't like to be separated from me. Thank you! Thank you. I just arrived at the hotel. Don't worry. My mom must still think of me as a child. I'll call you after the concert. an email has arrived Mr. Managing Director The new Representative Director has been announced as Han Sang Moo! You're so odd. If you keep doing this, I won't be able to control myself. You said you like it when it's different. Hold on a minute! How can you go up even after I called out? If it was me, I would have waited. All right. Check in with me later. Thank you. I'm just taking responsibility for my words. I am sorry. I am sorry. It is okay. What exactly are you doing to earn your paycheck? Don't you know Yong Gi brought a girl here? - Call him. - Yes. Damn bastard... What is he doing? President, mother sends her regards. I guess you can't help it if it's in your blood. Do you always have to talk like that to feel better? Meet someone in your class. Class? Do you have so much class that you had two wives? Stop hitting! It hurts. Why are you looking at me like you have a problem? What's wrong with your clothes? You really want to be a father that badly? The other party cannot answer the phone right now. It's not like you're going to fly away or bury yourself so why aren't you picking up the phone? How many times have I told you to fix your issue with running away when you're mad? What can you do? Try to let it go with my dad. Since I love you a lot, let it go. Let it go! Why did you come down when I'm already here? I still should come down. Let's rush. This is a resort you worked so hard for and it's a good day, but it got ruined by that punk, Yong Gi. It's your fault too that he's living like that. What's wrong with your hand? It's nothing. That always means there's something. Let's do really well. Oh wait! You go first. - No, please go first. - No, you go first. Lee Soo Hwan Congratulations. You grew up so pretty. Thanks for coming so far. It's a golden wedding of my mother's godmother. I must do the celebration performance. But what was your name? In Jung. Na In Jung. Guest? Are you a congratulator? What are you doing? Get out of here. So anal. Who was that? Was it you? I didn't do it on purpose, so keep it down. Shouldn't you apologize first? You didn't give me a chance. How can there be a person like you? There are. Pretty unni, let it go. Cranky unni, sorry! Real funny. He said I'm pretty so I'll let it go. - Congressman. - Hello President Park. I'm a little late. I was going to be sad because I thought you weren't coming. My schedule is always centered around yours. Thank you. I heard you started a new project. Your promotion will be no doubt. Soo Hwan, you're mad at your father, aren't you? That position isn't going anywhere. Don't give up. I was thinking about whose future to build, yours or an employee. Companies are build as *family management. (*President's family members have positions in the company) I want to cheer up the employees by giving them promotion. We're family, aren't we? Family who understand each other, can wait for each other. I'm going to cool my head and head up. Maze Park? It's pretty. Where am I? I learned for the first time today how bad my brain was. We meet again. You're right. It was just the two of us last time, and it's just the two of us now. Us two? Am I acting like we're closer than we really are? Do you want to be on closer terms with me? Soo Hwan, it's father. Yes. Excuse me for a moment. Yes? It was a decision that couldn't be helped. Don't worry about it. I'm sure it was my fault for lacking. Yes, I understand. I'll figure it out. How long were you planning on being upset? They say people trip even when it's a flat road. I'm not sure what's casting such a dark expression on your face, but take a big breath and start again. That's the best you can do. Since I took a deep breath, I should try to find the beginning again, right? Where should we go? We should pick where there's a path, right? Which one? Left or right? Left. How do you know? If you're ever lost in a maze, you can find your way out if you follow your left wall. You must know a lot about mazes. Probably because the world is a huge maze. It's like that. We lose our direction and walk around aimlessly. If we don't want to do that, then we can just listen to what our heart says. What our heart says? I'm going this way. I see. Well, goodbye. I'm going this way. Do you want to come with me? My heart is telling me to say that. Thank you. I didn't even imagine I'd be able to ride in a yacht like this. It's so good. Do you want to drive it? Can I? This is so intriguing. Do I just do it like this? It's okay. It happens when the wind is rough. You're bleeding. My hands are healing hands. Do I make you uncomfortable? You may make me cautious, but you don't make me uncomfortable. You make me nervous, but you don't make it difficult. You seem like a good person. You're so beautiful, you drive me crazy. Aren't you cold? What should we do starting from today? Starting from today? Those words make me feel really good. Where are we going? A man like you is perfect. You completely understand my heart. Welcome. Please give it to us. I really wanted to get a ring from you. Do you like it? I didn't think twice. Green looks really good on you. It looks fresh and clear. It's pretty. Can you show us other things? Is this Mozart? I'll play this just for you. What? Why are you looking at me like that? I think I've totally fallen in love with you now. I don't think I've just fallen. I've fallen to death for you. Congratulations on your concert. I really wanted to be there but there was an important meeting. To my very kind Na In Jung, I'm always sorry. I'm letting it go since you had a meeting. I'm sorry. Yes, I have a meeting at dinner. Then we can't meet today either? I'll call you later. We might forget each other's faces. Oh! By the way... Really? When was it announced? Oh I see. Okay. Let's hang up now. What do you mean you're not going to Paris? Are you out of your mind? Of course, I am. I've fallen in love. That's fine but how can you completely give up your dream? He's my dream now. Sunbae, I don't think I can live a single day without him. It's dangerous to make a man your everything. Don't rain on my parade! It's me. I'll be in front of your house later. In Jung, there's something I need to tell you. What do you think? Is it okay? Of course! My daughter looks like a sunflower. But when are you going to introduce him to us? He's been so busy I haven't been able to see him much either. He said he has something to say to me. Oh my gosh! He must want to propose to my daughter! I won't be late. I'm going to give up Paris. How can I leave you behind? I missed you so much, I thought I was dying. You look thin. Should we eat dinner first? Something fattening. In Jung. What is it? I'm sorry, customer, I need to check your bag. Let go immediately. You're new, aren't you? You don't know who I am, do you? Let go while I'm being nice. We have you on the security camera stealing the earrings. Please let go before I report you. What... report me? Okay, I said I'm on my way. I sure did raise one hell of a daughter. You want to break up? Let's stop seeing each other. Stop seeing each other? Why... what's wrong? Something's going on, isn't it? Tell me what's going on. There must be a reason you're doing this. Did I do something wrong? Did you change your mind? You don't like me? Or.. I'm.... I'm a married man. What did you just say? First go to the hospital and then talk to the manager. If you weren't so rude, I wouldn't have thrown the mirror. Mom, father must be waiting. I'm so sorry. It's all our fault. She's new and didn't recognize your daughter. Just keep it quiet, so the president doesn't find out. Why do you steal? There's no embarrassment like this. Are you not taking your medication these days? I know my illness well. It won't get better because of medication. I told you stay home during those days. It was calm for so long but why are you doing this now? It was our mall, not somewhere else, so what's the big deal? You're right, you're so smart. Why do you live like you're dead? How can a living person live like they're dead? I can't live because of you. I think he's having an affair. Who? Your favorite son-in-law, Lee Soo Hwan. That doesn't even make sense. Enough. My mouth hurts. Have you gone insane? Right, I'm always the crazy bitch. He definitely has a new bitch. Just leave him alone. What are you going to do if he really has an affair from you nagging him like this? I told he already is. Where does all this paranoia come from? From you of course. You're always paranoid of father, so he went out and had a son with another woman. I told you not to talk about that! Why did you lie to me? Why didn't you say anything? Why? I loved you so much, I lied to you. I wanted you, so much I lied to you. I decided to tell you but was afraid I'd miss you tomorrow so I didn't. I would promise to tell you tomorrow but when it came, I couldn't. Because I love you, because I wanted to continue to love you. Just answer it. Where are you? We'll talk later. In Jung. Let me go! I love you. Should we die together? Can you bring your father to me and have him apologize? Saying sorry is your last excuse. It's driving me crazy. Kang Yong Gi, you can't beat your father. It's all right. Are you still going to see that girl? Do you think we won't because you're trying to split us apart? Father, I can't leave her. Why? Because I don't want to be like you. I don't want to be like someone I know by not being able to protect the woman I love, and thinking about her for the rest of my life. At least come and have dinner with the family before you leave. Are we family because we sit around and eat together? It's almost time for my flight. Okay. I'll call you when I get to New York. Just ride with me. Who is that? Can you wait a minute? Don't cry alone. I said don't cry alone. Who is that? If you're going to cry, do it in front of that person. Don't you think then, he'll feel guilty? Who are you to get involved? I'm saying this because you looked dumb crying alone. Words of sympathy? Saying I love you a million times, but when you say it's over only once and it ends, that's what love is. Should I teach you one other thing? The revenge to those who betray love is simple. You forget them. Completely. So much that they don't even come up in your dreams. Forget him like that. Look here... there's sympathy that's wanted and sympathy that's not. Another mean bastard has ruined the life of a beautiful girl. Bastard. What did you just say? I'm a married man. Why are you picking up so late? Are you busy? What is it? Can't a mother just call her son? Why don't you stop by home anymore? Are things at work going well? Oh Soo Hwan, isn't it time for the completion of the new officetel? What are you talking about? Nothing, I'm just curious. Hey, I've quit playing cards a long time ago. I'm at the sauna. Oh by the way, tell your in-laws that we should play golf sometime. I'm busy now, so let's hang up. It's completed soon, so get your money ready! Will it break the finger of that great son of yours to have dinner with us? Then he won't be able to draw? I guess he doesn't want to feel like second-class. Father, when's he coming back from America? Mom? Don't you wish he would never come back? Can't you shut your mouth and eat? How can I eat with my mouth shut? I'm sorry, I'm late. Is Yong Gi not here yet? Don't talk about him. That conversation is over. You were out of the office. Where were you? There was a meeting because of the resort. Dammit meeting... Why don't you schedule a meeting with your wife one day? Hey. What? Did I say something wrong? No you didn't. It's my fault. As long as you're aware. Dad, when he works, isn't it sexy? He always recognizes his fault. That's right, your mother called earlier. She said she's going on a trip next week. But she didn't ask for money. Did you give her some? She must have some left over from last month. She's becoming very thrifty. She's so lucky to have such a great son who'll take care of her. Stop saying things that will increase your wrinkles. I knew you were going to get a mouthful. Oh, my husband must be hungry. Honey, eat this first. Here. There's no one but me, huh? Her moods switch so quickly. Say it. I told you to say it. Say what? You've been out of it, like you're under anesthesia. Don't you have something you need to tell me? Then why do you always shut your mouth when you're around me. We had a great dinner. Let's not do this. You listen to things like this now? You sure became proper. What? Classic is supposed to be good for your brain. It's not like we're both right in the head. Honey?! Honey, where are you going? Alright, just leave. How far can a frog go when he hops out of his pond? Lee Soo Hwan, even if I go crazy, I'll never let you go! My life has really become pathetic. I'm so lonely. Soo Hwan. If worrying would helped the problem, it would have already been solved. Men need to learn to let go things that don't work out. It's not good to hold on to things that have no future. I've ended it. You're the only one who can keep this family and this company together. In the end, it's all yours. It's my fault Ju Ran is like that. I'm always grateful to you for being patient and living with her. Even so, don't make my child cry. You must be tired. Go up and rest. Here. Director. Director. I decided to tell you but was afraid I'd miss you tomorrow, so I didn't. I would promise to tell you tomorrow but when it came, I couldn't. Because I love you, because I wanted to continue to love you. Probably because the world is a huge maze. We lose our direction and walk around aimlessly. If we don't want, then we can just listen to what our heart says. Stand right there! I decided to choose the misery of loving you over the tears of losing you. Even if the end means hell, let's go together. Are you confident you won't regret it? That you won't resent me? Are you confident enough to wait for me? I'm... I'm a bad person. I know. I know what a bad person you are. I know, I know, I know. The director isn't here right now. I know. He must take me for a fool since I've been watching my temper. You listen to things like this now? You sure became proper. It was this bitch? I'll be going now. Go inside. Finish things with him. What are you going to do? What are you going to do if you get caught? You won't be able to work in this town again. You know how conservative and narrow-minded these people are. - Adultery is.. - It's not adultery. It's love. I know that. But to the law, it's not love. Let's get in, exercise is beginning. In Jung, they say that whatever has a beginning, has an ending. End it already. Are you Na In Jung? You dirty whore. Does it feel good to seduce another woman's man? Let's go outside. So you know to be ashamed? Let's go outside. Where do you get off? What are you? What are you? What are you going to do by looking at me? Even if I tore you apart it wouldn?t be enough! I know it's wrong. I know I'm a sinner in front of you. But I can't let him go. I'll take whatever punishment you want. Whatever you want, I'll take it. They say in life there's someone you want to hold on to. That must be you. In Jung. Let's smile when we walk out of here. Lee Soo Hwan? Hey adulterer! Live life correctly from now on. Are you laughing? Hey adulterer! I'm going to watch you until I die. Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad I didn't start it to get hurt like this. We can't break up. We still love each other. Don't you understand? That I left you? If we're born again, let's not meet. You still can't forget that girl? A man must live for his ambition. I asked you not to love. I love you even in death. Do you feel peace after stabbing me through my heart? Did we really love each other? NO! In Jung, think of me as dead. Because of love, because I love a man, I can't see anything else. Uncle. I lost the woman I love. Why are you doing this to me?! Main Translator: inbi Spot Translator: saturn Timer: julier Editor/QC: upikepik Coordinators: mily2, ay_link This is a FREE fansub.
