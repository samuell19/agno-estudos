I had expected to grow old together. 100 Years. Maybe even older. He was the love of my life. That's how it started. It was like in my fantasies. Weeks without shame, filled with lust and love. But what happened afterwards... ...never happened in my fantasies. What? Was it a debt collector? - Don't answer that. He'll leave. Or you could finally pay up. - I will, next week. I promise. - You've been saying that for 6 months now. It's not my fault. - No, it's all his fault. How can that be? - Just don't answer the door. I was just about to ask him for your money back. No fooling around, okay? - What does he want? If only I knew. - Well, I'd know. Just offer yourself up. I already did. - What? He just wanted you. Sorry. Well, that just barely worked out. Sorry, we're closed. - Yes, I know. I just want to talk to you. - Okay, talk. What do you want to say? Would you happen to know who I am? No, sorry. - You don't know who I am? Wait, you do look slightly familiar. - Yes, that's quite possible. But from where? - Stage? Movies? No, that's not it. - Television perhaps? No, I don't have one. Have you been here before? I have a question for you. - Fine. Ask. Did you ever act? - No, sorry. Would you play with me? Would I play with you? That's a bit unexpected. - That's the general idea. Floor's surrender. Floor, is that short for Florence? - Why? Nice name. Never heard of it. It won't be out until next month. It's about a woman who completely surrenders herself to true love. Surrenders to who? - A man. What kind of man? - To whom she is the one true love. He's very much in love with her. - Is she in love with him? She doesn't know he's been in love with her for quite some time. Romantic. - Very. Love. - Unconditional love. That would be nice, wouldn't it? Wait. It's a big adventure. - And you'd be in it with me? It's a movie with two roles. I'm not an actrice. - Yes you are. You're wrong. - No, I see a real actress. But I can't act. - I can teach you. Acting is trusting each other. Trust? What's that again? Ah yes, I gave up on that. Know what? Think about it for a bit. Take your time. Wait, are you serious? - Yes. I don't even know you, And you don't know anything about me. That doesn't matter. - Seriously? You don't care at all? - No. Just go. Hurry up. We've been doing this piece for 20 years now? 20 Years sounds about right. 20 years. And we still can't get enough. No, it's almost as if we're really married. Why didn't you tell me you're afraid to drive? A car accident like that really makes you think. You race through life... ...but then, when you're almost dead and have been bed-ridden for 6 months... ...you really start to think. What do I really want out of life? I had the same thing. I really started to think about my life. I've seen the world. Checked off everything on my bucket list. And when I came back I asked him. 'Are you finally going to make me happy?' And then he said: 'Will you marry me?' Then he talked about the movie. Yes... You were talking about the movie, right? So, what else do you want to know about me? I have great news. Later today, the doctors are finally going to say I'm cancer-free. Yes, yes, it's fantastic. Won't that make a great headline tomorrow? Don't leave me hanging. My love is pending. Ending. That's fast. - Did you have a think? Fine. What's this about exactly? - A man seduces a woman. And then? - They go a little further step by step. Sounds familiar. - Don't think so. You really want to make a movie with me in it? Your first role, my last. - Just like that? No, not just like that. Read this. I had expected to grow old together. 100 Years. Or more. We were going to stay together until death do us part. Great. - Great. Read it. Do you want something to drink? Who are you, he asked. And what can I get you to drink? He looked at me. My name is Floor, I said. His is Erik. Then something came over me I'd never experienced before.. Never before did I fall in love that quickly. Every time our fingertips touched, toasting life... ...I felt a tingling in my toes and everywhere between. And? That's a lot. Right off. - A lot? Well, in love just like that. - A lot? Too much? Maybe I should read it again. Get to know her a little better. Then when he said goodbye later that night... ...he asked me for my phone number. There, now you have mine too, Erik said. Please, most beautiful girl in town. He smiled and kissed me on both cheeks. Not pretend, real. And just a tad longer than normal. His hand half on my back... What is it? I like the text message. - But? The hand... - How would you do it? Me? - If you were Floor. Now? - Let's do it? I have to go. Can I have your number? We could meet up sometime.. 06-356 318 10. - There. If you'd sent me a text like that I think I could have done it. Can I have two white wine, one baco and twice bitterballs? On the way. See, you can act? Yes, but this is easy. - I have a proposition. A proposition? What so funny? Do you know how many propositions I get here? Or at night, after a performance? - This is a special proposition. Last week I got proposed to twice. I don't want to offend you, but this had better be spectacular... ...if you're thinking about challenging or surprising me. And I might even be gone. Away from all this. For ever. What are you doing? A proposition. That was the beginning. Meeting the ideal man can be this simple. That one guy that makes you change your mind within the hour. Unable to send a message... ...because your fingers are trembling. Easy, easy. How did you get in here? - Your sister. Idiot. - Not at all. I paid her a month's rent. And tomorrow you'll steal her stuff? I'm not that bad? Did you escape? - Good behaviour. And they fell for it? I'm myself again. - I'm sure you are. Now get out. I've changed. How many times have you said that? - This time it's true. We've had this talk before, John. - This time it's really true. Oh really? Is there someone else? None of your business. There's something about you. - Really? If there's someone else... - I thought you'd changed. And I wrote a song for you. It's the best. This is it. It's for you. - There's the bin. People make mistakes. Some people make a lot of mistakes. I don't want to make any more. - Neither do I. I've changed. I slept terrible that night. Something happened to me that I couldn't explain. Finally I got his text. Can I make it on Saturday? I'll rearrange my schedule, I lied. It was like Saturday was never going to come. On Friday I picked out the perfect outfit. Then I changed it three more times. Still I was scared. Afraid to lose myself? That's how it started We kissed, we caressed... ...and did other things that there's probably words for as well. Or maybe not. But we still did them anyway. They were weeks without shame. Filled with lust... ...and love. Buon appetito. Do you know this? - I don't think so. Legend says, this can only happen once in a life time. And you can't see it. Close your eyes. Divine. What is it? If the movie turns out like this... What do you mean? It's beautiful. So far. - But? To read is to fantasize. - A movie is watching. See how much in love they are. It's beautiful. They make love all weekend. And then... - They make love again. And again. And then they start to seduce each another. Tease each other. She seduces him at his office. He seduces her in a restaurant. And I'm at page 33. I'd film the essence. - Okay. How? One scene that says it all. If you could pick a scene, which would it be? Out of all of them? I don't know. It's all so much. We're Floor and Erik. - Of course, they're our parts. That's why we're here. - To see what we should film. To see if we're going to do this or not. You're teasing me. I'm letting you choose. - And I really like that. One scene. It's hard. You don't have to. - I know. But then... - Then it's over. It's all so fast. - Time flies. If you want to go, you can leave. - Then I'll leave. That's a coincedence. Did something happen? Igor dumped him. Yes. At least, I think. I still can't understand him. Maybe he's bootlegging vodka on the Veluwe. At least I hope so, against my better judgement. How did rehearsels go? - Very well, yes. We're growing old. Or hadn't you noticed? Is there something I should know? Who's the cute face you brought along? She's a brand new talent. - She is? And what exactly is her talent? Honey, why don't you just go and memorize the wine chart? No home brew vodka for me. Or maybe I should. Tim, can I see you in my office? It's back. A few more months. Fuck. I'll send her away. - No, no need for that. Her final wish is... Her final wish, she won't dare to ask you herself. Before you start making plans with her over there... Well, I don't think so. Not? Good... Sucks to be you. Sorry. Shall we talk about it tomorrow? - No, wait. She wants you to ask her. - What? We have to stop this. - You think I'm going to stop? Do you know what I really hate? People underestimating me. Hold up. Where did you get this number? Listen, if you really changed, never call me again. Shakespeare was quite a slick one, wasn't he? Sorry? - Shakespeare. Didn't Tim tell you his favourite quote? No. - What did he tell you? Why? Tell me, what's your talent? Everything alright here? - Never better. We were just discussing my talents. Will you marry me? Is that a proposal? Yes. This is just between us, right? Only Cees, jij en ik. No one else. Swear you won't tell anyone? No one. I do. Well, your talent awaits you. That was a crazy situation. I have to go there. You have my number. I'll call you. We were together for a few months, then he wanted to own me. I'm yours, he said. He wanted me to do everything for him. He said: 'You promised me.' He was right. I'd do anything for him. Where are you? I asked him: 'What do you mean by everything? Like SM or something?' 'I'm not into that.' He said: 'How do you know? Have you ever tried it?' I said: 'No, of course not.' Go on. But that wasn't the whole truth. I've had some fantasies after I read something. But I'd never tell anyone about that. What happens next? That's up to you and me. - No, it's up to the book. We decide on the essence. Of the book. - Of your Floor. Of your Erik. - We're playing parts. What am I now? - I have no idea. Of course you do. I'm playing the part every woman should play in her life. Let's not get hypocritical. I'm playing the part of a whore. I can do that, I can shut off my feelings. The only problem is, SM doesn't make me feel anything. That's why. - Why what? The pain? - It's not pain. It's surrender.. I don't understand. - You have to experience it. That's easy. - It fascinates me. It's a game. - I understand that. Scary can be exciting. - What about it fascinates you? That's what I want to find out. Together with you. Then we can find out about Erik and Floor... ...so that we can become them. How? - That's up to you. So, what you're really saying is... ...you and me should look for our own motivation... ...to play Erik and Floor? - Yes. So she will be your Floor. The Floor in you, that's your secret. Your secret fantasy. Which I would never tell anyone about.. - Except one very special someone. Someone you trust. Don't you have this one secret fantasy that turns you on? That you'd never tell anyone about? It's about time. Sorry, I really wouldn't know. I haven't trusted anyone in a long time. So now what? - We're going to find a place to sleep. Very cliche, but my roommate has an unexpected visitor. I live behind that window there. - You live across from this bar? Yes. - I've never seen you before. No, that's right. I had to stay indoors for 6 months. Really. That's all. I'm asking for honesty. But the big thing is, I have no fantasies when it comes to SM. Wine? - Yes, lovely. Then what is the mystery around Fifty Shades? Almost 2 million Dutch women have bought those books. 5 Million have read them. Voluntarily... No one forced them to. So what is it that attracts them? Cheers. I have no idea. - Really? I have a clean towel here. You can use this shirt of you want. I'll be over there. By the way, I haven't read it. Not? - No. Well, just a few lines in the book store. One should know what everyone's talking about. But I really though the writing was awful. Exactly. that's what all women say. Except that those 5 million women did finish the books. Why? Is it a taboo? Or does it touch them. Excite them? And are they too afraid to talk about it. No answer? Are you a hypocrite? Me? I'm not a hypocrite. - Is it a taboo then? I don't know why it would be a taboo in this day and age. Because there's not a single woman who will tell me what it is that touches them. Why is that? You don't know, do you? - I know. Then tell me. Honestly. Well, the thing is... Well, not exactly. - You're not being honest. What do you want from me? - It's very simple. I want you to trust me and I want you to be honest. Yes, but... What do you want from me? Let's stop this. Was Erik done with me? There was no word from him at all. I couldn't keep up. I texted him. okay, let's try it - one time. He asked me if I was willing to completely surrender to him. And I nodded. I'd do anything for him. I'd turn over, make love, explode. Touch him everywhere. But I have to wait. I have to completely surrender. He said that no matter what happens, I have to keep quiet. I asked him: 'Is that really what you want?' He said: 'Yes, that's what I want.' See, and this is what I've always dreamed about. Wow. - Can you tell I'm not wearing anything underneath? Are you superstitious? - Not so far. Good. Neither am I. Superstition would have you believe in 7 years bad luck if you make love in your wedding dress. But that's if you only have 7 years to live. Or 7 months. Very well. We'll get married and then I'll only have to make it to opening night. It'll also be my last. Do you think I'm beautiful? Very beautiful. Cees, it's time. Tanja, you tell him. - No, Cees. You tell him. The fact is, Tanje will leave half to you and the other half to me. And that we'll run this business together. That's that fact of the matter. Shall we talk about it tomorrow? - No, time is running short. You and Cees will take care of the replacements for next year... ...and it is my explicit final wish to be married on Friday. Will that work for you? I can do that. Then we'll talk to the press on Wednesday. Will the be alright? For you, always. - That's so sweet. Well, we're done then. That was easy, wasn't it, Cees? Oh, and something else. How serious are you about that girl? I've only just met her. Don't talk crap. Not to me. Not ever. Cees tells me you've been staring out the window head over heels for half a year now. Do you want an honest answer? Can I handle it? I really hope this is going to work out. And you really think you can do it? - Tanja, don't. I really think so, yes. - You're really, really a lot older. Don't. - Even if you can get her... ...how do you think she'll be about it in a year's time? Tanja, don't. - I want you to be happy. And I'm dead serious about that. That's sweet. I am. And I want to talk to her. Where were you last night? - John, listen to me. It's over, it was over, it will always be over. So fuck off. So that is? Quicker every time? Good, then you can unpack your gift now. If you won't leave right now, I will, alright. You're beautiful when you're angry. I'm so past angry, John. You just want me, and you know it. You're upset, and rightfully so. Can't you see I'm in love? You're just saying that. It won't work. I never thought it would happen to me, but still it did. Okay. - What? I'll do whatever you want. - I don't want anything from you. I'm on my knees for you. - I don't want anything from you. I'll do whatever you... I love you and you love me. No one in the world loves you as much as I do. No one comes even close. You're not in love. You're just angry and you want to hurt me. If you don't leave right now, I will. If you leave me now, you leave me no other choice. I don't want to go on without you, and you don't want to go on without me. You're just telling yourself you're in love right now. Soon he will get rid of you. I'd never do that, you know that. Or you will dump him because he not as exciting and sweet as you thought. And then you'll want me back. Am I right or am I right? Am I right or am I right? In the days that followed I fell more and more in love. We took it further and further. It became more and more familiar. And every time I could surrender a bit more. Eva. Is this going too fast? - Not a clue. Is this real? - Well, it feels real. Or are we just fooling ourselves? - How so? Just. It feels... special. - Yes, but it is special. Would you dump me? - Me? Would you dump me? What if we make this movie... ...can there be a scene where you ask me to go with you? To... somewhere out there. - Why? No reason. It's romantic. What do you think is romantic? Going away for the weekend. - That's what I was going to say. Now you. What do you think is romantic? - Breakfast in bed. What's romantic about Fifty Shades? I haven't read it. - What if you had? Why? We'll have to find out. That's the key. Okay. He.... the guy from Fifty Shades.... He's into SM. - Yes, and he's still romantic. Why? - I don't know. Because he's rich? - No, that's not it. Successful? - That's not important. Because he's sweet? - No, he's not. Because he's an asshole? - That he is. And arrogant asshole who hurts people. Don't you dare. - What? That's what he's doing? Not like that. - Then like what? Different. - How? Stop it. No. Tim, you're playing... ...and you're trying to force something but that's not how it goes. Okay, then how? Why do you ask? - I want to understand. Why? - I can't act it otherwise. 5 Million women get excited by candle wax and bondage. But 5 million men don't understand a thing about it.. Yes we do. 5 Million men don't understand their wives. And do you know why? Because when those men ask their wives what excites them about it... ...they all say it written awfully... ...and that they only read a little bit. Why? I don't know. - Yes you do. Because they're afraid. - Of what? That their husband will hear to truth. So they pretend like it's nothing to them. And all the while theu just found out that there's a whole lot more. And that there's a lot more that turns them on... ...and that they can take their fantasies a lot farther... ...then they dare admit to their husbands. And if you don't give in, then we can't go on. Of course we can. You are not surrendering. Do you surrender? - To you? Name a fantasy. - A fantasy? Okay, I'm at the bus stop. that's too simple. OK. I'm working ina kitchen. Too plain. - I'm walking down the street. That's a little bit easy, isn't it? Fine. I'm lying on the beach. Yes, but that's a cliche. OK. I'm... I'm... I'm in a store. That's nothing. Tell me your most secret fantasy. Listen, is it in the book, about that secret fantasy? And why do you ask? If it's in the book, I'm willing to try it. What do you want to try? Try if I can surrender to you. OK. Then we can move on. It's here. The hotel room door was slightly ajar. Anything else? - There will be a text message. 'I'm convinced you'll satisfy us.' Us? - Yes, us. So there will be someone else? - Maybe. Exciting. Arousing. - No. A bummer. I wouldn't have gone in. You have to go in. Not me. Floor. - Yes, your Floor. And you have to find something to make your Floor go in. What would convince you? Did you really spend 6 months in your bed looking at me. Yes. So you fell in love with me during that time? Without even talking to me... ...and without knowing if I even like you... ...you still came to me. OK, I can go in. OK. The curtains were split just a bit so a little daylight came in. Candles were burning and there was champagne. Exciting or romantic? - Both. And there was Erik. It's as if since we first met... ...he only got more handsome and exciting. You'll have to make due with me. I quickly looked around again. No one. Relieved, I took a breath. I could have someone waiting in the bathroom. You say: 'We'll see about that.' I like to keep it exciting. I notice a secret sensation about the other one. Then what? In my fantasy, I'd been with two men before. Or with three. But those were fantasies. Other people will have different fantasies. And you're willing to share them with me? I decided to keep it to myself. And then I saw the silk scarf on the bed. I asked: 'What are you going to do to me today?' And how do I respond? It wasn't intended as a question. It was a statement. I'm all yours. Do with me whatever you will. Do you're surrendering completely? Exciting. A little scary. Slowly he unbuttons my blouse. One by one, and then took it off. He was standing behind me, and I felt his hands on my breasts. His fingers moving past my nipples. For a moment he caressed them. What is it? I couldn't do this. - Do what? What comes next. I felt his hands touching my breasts. Tenderly. I closed my eyes, but then he pinched me. I cramped up inside, but I kept quiet. Yes, and then? That's good, he whispered in my ear. And he kissed me as a reward. It's true: pain can be stimulating if you surrender to it. He slowly pulled my skirt down. He showed me the silk scarfs. One for one wrist, and one for the other. And then he had one for my eyes. You read the rest. I soon found out that this time the scarf wasn't for my eyes. Slowly he brought it... This is going to take awhile. - Can I help? No, there's no need. I always thought SM wasn't for me. But I can't do anything other than admit it's taken control of me. I felt a new sensation, one I had fantasized about... ...but never before I'd dared to admit. Well, well, hopelessly in love. Discovering boundaries. Going to a swingers club. And he wants to give you away. this won't be a children's story. Well, at least he's not like he is at home. The next day I got a text. I had to go to a store. A yellow dress in the window. Buy it and put it on. No underwear. I waited for my next task. This wasn't a game anymore. I was beginning to understand. I would have never sat down like this. But I did. because I had to. He'd sent her to help me get past my fears. She gave me a questionnaire. A test.. Did you know more than half the Dutch people experiment with SM? No. Did you get a high score? If I'm honest, yes. That's the challenge. 'Can I be honest with myself?' Safeword? - A safeword can be anything. Except 'go on.' Unless you never want to stop of course. You know... ...the moment you overcome one of those fears... ...so many worlds will open up to you. A year ago, I would have never dared to do this. I had to go to the hotel lobby. All those men could tell I wasn't selling post cards. What was the next step? What did he expect if one of them would approach me? Or asked me to go with him? And then I saw him. Reward. I had to go to the same hotel room. And there was a surprise for me there. 'Come, let's go,' he said. My reward was a long weekend in the sun. A great hotel with a pool, a spa, and the best chocolate and champagne... ...and he wanted me to give him something. He wanted me to make his fantasy come true. He wanted him and me and someone else... Eva. Eva. You were gone for a bit. Someone's knocking. - Who? I don't know. Are you expecting anyone? - No. Who is it? - A stranger. Listen. If I promise to completely surrender to you... ...can we take a businessclass flight to the sun right now? You want to completely... - Completely. Honestly. - OK. I'll have to call Cees to make the arrangements. Just don't ask any questions. Come on. Cees, where's the tickets? - Tanja wanted a word with you. I've spoken with her over the phone. She still wanted a word before I bought the tickets. One of your transparent tricks? No, it's one of my transparent tricks. Can I borrow Tim from you for a moment? I told you I'd be away for the weekend. I'll be back on Monday. What is this? We got this from an old friend of Cees' at the tabloids. Actor with whore while girlfriend in final stages of terminal cancer, yada yada yada. If we had any comment, he asked. He can't have said that. - He did. It seems your yellow dress was arrested once for prostitution... ...and she's married to a pimp. He just got out of jail. In any case, this is a disaster. For your future. And the future of Cees and this management agency. You'll end up burying me in a cardboard box. I want you to distance yourself from her right now. And if I don't? What did that accident do to you? That I'm honest for once in my life. - Honest? This is a bad time for honest... ...because you'll be doing a lot of lying for the next few hours.. Or you'll be destroying my last wishes in this marriage. Do you want that? What a nice yellow dress. - Thank you. Where's Tim? He's busy for abit. He'll be here shortly. Cees will get you the tickets, you can get going at once. Wait a moment... - Eva. Eva. How fitting. Yes. Eva. Do you know how many girls like you... ...I've seen come by here the past 20 years? Cees? - A lot. All new talents. Well, I wasn't an angel either. It keeps things interesting. Excuse me, are you guys married? - Nee, we haven't gotten around to that yet. How about you? A lot of loose contacts? Or are you married? Anyway. Tim's butterflies came flying in... ...and they kept going. But it seems that you... ...that it's all different this time. Excuse me, I'll go wait outside. - Have a seat. Have a seat. There's a good chance that Tim finally found the one in you. And so I strongly urge you... There's no one in this world I love more than Tim. I'd do anything to avoid him getting hurt. Still, I'll be gone soon. No. And so I want to ask you... Make him happy, will you? Just make him happy. Alright? Tim's busy for a little more. But then he'll go straight to the airport. I have your tickets here. Your cab's waiting around back. Walk with me? Was this another one of Tim's tests? Maybe the ultimate test. If I could really surrender completely. Would he only come to Dubrovnik if he was utterly convinced? Or should I be prepared for whatever he has in store for me? How would this go on? Busy? Waiting for someone? I hear and see nothing. That's too bad. I think you will find this an interesting read. Let me go. It seems you're very special. Something you need to taste at least once in your life. I thought you quit? - I did. This one doesn't count. Come on. just keep walking. I'm not done yet. - Not done? Then walk on your own. I'm a big girl. Damnit john. Big girl? Then you can walk. Listen, I have to go to the hospital. I need a cab now. No, not in 15 minutes. I need one now. This is an emergency. i have to go. What? Damnit. Cees. Where are you? In the hospital. - Did she come around? It's over. What do you want? SM? Do you want SM? I'll give you all the SM you want.. I told you he'd dump you? I'm right over here. That was the last time. Sorry, OK. Sorry. I'm trying to change, alright? Pasta torte, is a local dish. It's said to be real good. I'm sorry, alright? I'm sorry. I took pictures of you two. At the hotel. And a small biography. A what? Mine. And yours. I didn't want to lose you. What was in it? Nothing. Doesn't matter. It does. What was in it? That you're a hooker. I know. You're not and you'll never be. But I didn't want to lose you. Go away. - I love you. Go away. If you don't leave right now... It's bad isn't it? - Did Igor return yet? Last night. Good vodka. At least I assume it was good. And this morning he left again. Good old Igor. Maybe I should say goodbye to him. What do you think? Tim, I'm speaking to you as your best friend. Your only friend. Who really cares about you. Yes. - It's about time... ...for you to finally... - Shut up. What? - Shut up. You can't completely... - Shut up. Tim? Hello? In a bit. ♪ over and over again, as if it never heals ♪ the pain remains about what once was ♪ but time and time again I think: one will come ♪ love forever, over and over again I see we have some married men here tonight. I'm not married. Then you need to read the tabloids. That's not real. - Like the rest? That's real. - Right. It's real and you know it. No. I don't know anything anymore. Can we talk? - No. Please. Fine. Talk. Here? - Why not? OK. I wanna go on with you. You want to go on with a whore? I don't care. - I'm not a whore. Never was and I'll never be one. And I want to go on with you. - With your book? That too. The book, that's not fair. - It is. If we're going on, then without the book. The book... that's me. It's a woman's book. - It's a pseudonym. Yours? I wrote it in all those months I had to stay inside. For you. After I had my accident, I thought I only had a little longer to live. I only wanted a single thing, and that's be honest with myself... ...and with the one I want to spend the rest of that life with. I was lying up there in that bed. I saw you every single day. I read all kinds of books. Fifty Shades. It touched me, and every day I fell more in love with you. But I didn't... I didn't know how to tell you that You know... Tanja always quoted me one of those Greeks. Oscar Wilde. He wasn't a Greek, it was Oscar Wilde. 'Only with a mask on can you really tell the truth.' So Erik in the book... - Is me. And Floor? How did you know my middle name was Florence? The first time I heard your voice. Eva, do you remember when we talked about sailing together? You can't leave now. Shall we go? Together? Recent studies show that half the Dutch people... ...experiments with SM. Are you part of that half or are you still not ready... ...but are you secretly dreaming of a little experimental SM? Specifically, what will you do for love? I had expected to grow old together. 100 Years. Or more. He was the love of my life. We were going to stay together until death do us part. Yes, this is Eva. Do you know where Tim is? OIne minute please. Alright. Your minute starts now. Where is Tim? - I don't know. Don't lie to me. Where is Tim? Gone. - Where? I'm not allowed to tell you. - Where, Cees? He doesn't want you to know. He doesn't want anyone to know. I really need to talk to him. - I'm sorry. Can you pass him a message? - No. Tell him I'll have a book for him soon. A book I want to read with him, and play with him. Why do millions of women and why do I drool over Fifty Shades? And why do I yearn for Floor's surrender? Could it be that we desire to be wanted that much? Are we willing to explore new frontiers? What is it about not crossing that frontier? What is that mystery? I think I've finally found it. And it's because of Tim. To read is to fantasize. To talk about it with someone else destroys the mystery. It will become flat, and it will be gone. That was Tim's problem too. He didn't even realize it. Tim needed Erik and Floor to tell me about his desires. And that's why I'm writing a story for him now. So that, through Floor, he can experience my fantasies. And it all begins in a bar. DO NOT DISTURB
