We have to pick your mother up on way, so hurry up. - It's your fault, you're so softy, you know? Getting involved in this nancy business - Right and I suppose when Axl Rose does his nancy business at all, is it? - That's different. - You could show some pride in our son's talent, you know? - What am I doing? I must be mad [Music] - You're all right miss? - Paul Bigsby What on earth are you playing at? [Music] - Well, you really haven't given me much choice, have you? [Music] - These are expensive, Tamara. Now, ladies and gentlemen, our final act for this evening is our much-anticipated performance from Paul Bigsby. However Paul is here to perform for you tonight in a slightly different capacity. He has decided to play homage to a cabaret neighbours in Blackpool by using his unique voice to bring a little variety into our school. Variety is, as they say, the spice of life and...hmm...well... to that end may I introduce Anastasia. [Music] A thousand thundering thrills await me Facing insurmountable odds gratefully The female of the species is more deadly than the male Shock-shock, horror-horror, shock-shock, horror I'll shout myself hoarse for your supernatural force The female of the species is more deadly than the male Oh, she deals in witchcraft And one kiss and I'm zapped Oh, how can heaven hold a place for me? When a boy like you has cast a spell on me Oh, how can heaven hold a place for me? When a boy like you has cast a spell on me [Applause and cheering] [Music till the end]
