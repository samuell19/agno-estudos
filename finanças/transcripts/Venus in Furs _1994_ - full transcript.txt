V?NUS IN FURS Go on! Will you sign? Go on! - Tell me first. - I don't know. Who's that? How the hell should I know? - Shall I pick it up? - No! Feel like going on a journey. Where to? I haven't decided. What about me? I just have to go. Come along. - No. We made a deal. - So don't come along. Will you sign? Let's forget the whole thing. You don't mean that. I have to sign? All right then. At the age of ten, I laid my hands on a copy of The Legends of the Great Martyrs. I read it with a revulsion bordering on voracious ecstasy. They languished in dungeons, were roasted, pierced with arrows and were nailed to a cross. All of this they underwent in a state of intoxication. Gregor... Bring us something to drink, Gregor! Do you love that man? What man? I'm in love with you. I've never been more in love. Soon you won't love me any more. Tell me when, and you can have your freedom. I'm your property. Think hard about it. I am yours. Do with me as you will, but don't force me to leave. Is my bath ready? Gregor, hold me. I don't think I'm in love with Wanda. But I can feel I'm falling under her spell. This is no love, but physical enslavement. Don't stop! I can't! You enjoy it! I live as I paint and write. I progress no further than an intention, a plan, a first act a first line. Such people just happen to exist. They start all kinds of things, but never finish anything. I am someone like that, a dilettante. Beware Severin! Call me Gregor! All right... - Why did you kick me? - On your knees. Do you think you're a free person. A man... A great lover... I'm very bored. You're just enough to keep me amused. Don't look at me like that! I decide what you are. A man or an animal. Or a thing. I was twelve when a distant aunt, on my mother's side came to stay with us. She was beautiful woman, with a mysterious smile. But I hated her, because she was known as a femme fatale. I behaved spitefully and was as antisocial as I could be. My parents were away on a trip and I was alone with her. I walked down the stairs and was about to leave, but she stood in front of me, dressed in a fabulous fur coat. She grabbed me, before I could complain, I was lying on the marble floor bound hand and foot. With an evil grin, she rolled up her sleeves and birched me until I screamed out in pain and begged for mercy. She released me and I had to get down on my knees and thank her and kiss her hand. A fierce passion was awakened in me she has been the most attractive woman in the whole world. Still alive? You came to kill me? Are you unwell? Your cheeks are aglow. Do you love me? I want you to love me! Tell me! You have such beautiful eyes. Especially since you have been suffering so much. Can you still love me? I love you more then ever. The more you torment me, the more I love you. Call him! Good afternoon. This is the secretary of Madam von Dunayev. I'm very sorry. I shall try to speak clearly. This is the secretary of Madam von Dunayev. She asked me to make an appointment with you. Do you understand? Tomorrow evening, 20h30. Very good. I'll tell her. Who is he? Not now. No more questions, Gregor. I'm so tired, I've had enough. May I do something? Yes, my feet. I'm so sorry. Massage them. How will it all end up with us? End up with us? You and me. You and me? I haven't even begun! Look at me. I've done nothing yet. Wait until I really begin. Go and wait for me at the monkey's house! Go now! I'm not your servant! You've found your lord and master. Good luck. You're afraid of him, Wanda. You're boring me. Don't push me, I'm not leaving you. I have a contract with you. We have a contract and I shall fulfill it. I'll keep tormenting you until you hate me. - You're crazy!! - And I know how really hurt you. You'll see! On your knees! That's how I love you. Wait... What's wrong? - I dreamt you betrayed my trust. - Dreams can deceive you. Hold me! Don't you love me anymore? Shall I be nice just one more time? Just one time? Do you know the story of Dionysus'ox? A courtier invented for Dionysus, the tyrant of Syracuse, a new instrument of torture: It was an iron ox in which someone sentenced to death was placed. The ox was then put in a huge fire. . The screaming and wailing of the tormented victim in the red-hot iron sound like the mooing of an ox. Dionysus smiled nicely at the inventor and immediately had him placed in the iron ox to test his own invention. You are the one who incited me to violence. And you'll be the first victim. I now enjoy having someone in my power and mistreating him. Above all someone who loves me. Do you stii love me? Insanely! You're divine! The whip! Release me! Is that my slave? My property?
