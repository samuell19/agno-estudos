He refuses to come to therapy, and he doesn't want to touch you if not to make a baby. Liv, Landon is an OB-GYN. He delivers babies all day long. Since you haven't given him a child, I'm sure he feels like a complete sham without a family. - I am his family though. Right? - Clearly he wants more than just you. Relax. I presented you with the worst-case scenario to brace yourself for what could happen. It's called collision therapy technique where I collide a horrific scenario with your reality, and it creates a shock factor, which allows you to mentally and emotionally prepare for any potential traumatic event. - OK. - Now what you'll have to do is create a situation that makes Landon believe that he's changed his own mind about joining you here. - Yeah. How am I supposed to do that? - That's actually the easiest thing. Start a fight. Nothing's better for a relationship than a huge confrontation that airs everything out, even if it gets a little rough. Yeah. Then maybe your husband will think that joining you here would actually be the best thing he could do to save your marriage. Understand? Well, that is our time, Liv.

[crickets chirping] - Ohh. - Lan. - Yeah? - I'm sorry for ever thinking that you would sabotage my career. - Well, I know things have been off between us. But you should know that I would never do that. - I think it was Dr. Torres. Do you know her from anywhere? High school, old neighborhood, med school, anywhere? - I've never seen that woman before in my life. OK? - Are you sure? - I'm sure. - I stumbled across an old high school yearbook of yours in her office. - Wait, what? OK. There's one thing, but it's just one, OK? - Oh my God. - So she came into my office as a patient, and I had to administer an annual exam. But it was not sexual. - What? - It was not sexual at all. But she was being kind of weird. Like, she's asking me all kinds of personal questions and, like, moaning all weird, like, but I just did my job, and I got out of there. - Why didn't you tell me this? - Because I walk into the therapy session. She's sitting right there. So I freaked out. - I would have stopped going if I knew this. - I know. And I should have told you. But I didn't know how to tell you to stop going without starting another argument. - She's the one who smashed the crib. I found this in our nursery, and then I found a video with her wearing them. - [exhales] This last few weeks, I mean, it's been the worst of our marriage. - I know. I honestly thought that she was going to help us, not turn our lives upside down. - But why? Why would she do this? - I have no idea. Should I confront her? - I don't know about that. People these days are off. - She's a respected therapist. Why would she risk her reputation to stalk us? - I don't know. - Should I get Jayce to help us? Maybe he could use his charm to find out things that we need to know, and if something goes south, then he'll be able to handle himself. - That is actually a really good idea. [laughter] - Oh my God. Was that a compliment? - It was. Yeah. - Whoa. I just, I haven't heard one of those in I don't know how long. - Come on, now. You know I think you're the smartest woman in the world.

You know how my computer likes to die. - Clumsy. I knew you had a brother, but I didn't know he's kind of cute. Don't be late. I'm going to get us cleaned up. - What about your Pilates class? - I might still be able to make it. I just need to get cleaned up. - OK. Call me later, Jayce. - I got you. - You sure it's OK? - It's fine. You know this is Diane Von Furstenberg, right? - I did not know that. - Yes. - But you look good in it, though. - Thank you. - Great. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - Think I got a, uh... - Oh, uh...

Dinner tonight? - Dinner? - Dinner. It's the least you can do for ruining my dress. - I can do that. - Right. Well, I'll see you then.

[laughs] - You want to come back to my place for dessert? - Sounds like a great idea. [exhales] - The gentleman. - There you go. - Are you hopping in? - Coming with you, if that's OK. OK? All right? - Be my guest. [laughs] - You got a nice spot. - [laughs] - I... have a lot of nice spots. - Is that right? - That's right. - Come here. - You don't tell me what to do, Jayce.

Did he call you? - No. - He was with her last night. - With who? - Dr. Torres. - Well, what did he find out? - I don't know. I haven't heard from him. - Shit. That's not good. - I know. I'm going to go to the police. - Wait. Don't you think that's a bit extreme? - No. I have a really bad feeling about this. Just hurry home, OK? OK. I love you. - I love you too. - Hi. I'd like to file a missing persons report. - Who's missing? - His name's Jayce Jones. I haven't talked to him since yesterday. - He looks like someone who can take care of himself. What's your worry? - I think the woman he went on a date with last night is dangerous. - He went on a date? He's probably still on it. - No, no, you're not understanding. - OK, what's the woman's name that he went on a date with? - Dr. Alexis Torres. - She's on TV. Hey, your brother's a lucky guy. So look, your brother, he's a member of the U.S. Army, and he went on a date with a doctor, and you want to file a missing persons report? - Yeah, I do. I know you think this sounds crazy, but something is wrong. - I'm sure that he's OK. He's just fine. - Just listen. Something is wrong. - Just if you don't hear from him in a couple of days, just come back around. - Hi, I'm Olivia Richards, a potential client of Dr. Alexis Torres. I was just calling to see what your experience was with her. Oh, OK. Wow. Yeah, that's excellent. Great. OK. Yes. She was a pleasure to work with. Thank you. OK. Mm-hmm. So yeah, highly recommend her. Mm-hmm. [knock at door] Oh. It's, uh, I had met her very briefly, and so I was just trying to get a couple references and... come on... From past clients or anything like that. So I really appreciate your time. Yeah, thank you so much. OK, you too now. Bye-bye. - Nothing, huh? - Not a damn thing. Jayce is missing, and I know she had something to do with it. Wait a minute. Try this last. Got you. - Westridge Academy. How may I direct your call? - Hi, registrar's office, please. - Please hold. - Office of the Registrar. How may I help you? - Hi, I am calling from the Law Office of Richards and Associates. I wanted to confirm the graduation date of a new employee by the name of Alexis Torres. Would you be able to help me with that? - One moment, please. I'm sorry, but we don't have anyone by that name in our system. Could she be using a married name, or do you have a graduation year? - Around maybe 2006. - Sorry, we just don't have anybody by that name in our system. I checked the first name alone, and the only Alexis we have is currently a ninth-grader, and our records go back to 1965. Sorry. - OK. Thank you so much. Have a good one. She's hiding something. I know it. I need to figure out what this bitch is really up to. - I have an idea. [tense music] ♪ Bingo, bitch. I know where you live.

[ominous music] ♪ [phone chimes] [light music] - Juggling motherhood and thriving career, it's got to be really tough. - It has its challenges, especially now that he's a teenager. We're good, though. He's at a nearby boarding school, so I just meet him where he is. Pizza and movies every other Friday. - Oh, that's awesome. - He loves it. - I want to be just like you. Oh my God, hold on. Let me get that. I'm so sorry. Oh my gosh, so embarrassing. We're good. Thank you. Did it get on you? Are you OK? - I'm OK, actually. - Ooh, that was embarrassing. - Looks like you and your brother have a lot in common. - [laughs] Speaking of my brother, have you seen him? - No. Why, not since the day at the office. Has he been asking about me? - Oh, no. It's just, he's been MIA, and I thought I saw a nice little spark between the two of you. - Well, who wouldn't like me? [laughs] - This is so true. - But no. I mean, he's charming, but I am so far out of my pretty boy phase, you know. - Totally get it. This has been really great, and I think I'm going to call it. - All right. Well, I think I'm going to stay back for another drink. - Thank you. - Yeah, no worries. I'll handle the bill, by the way. - Oh my God, thank you. Have a good night. - Yeah, you need that. Bye, sweetie. - Bye-bye. - [sighs] [phone chimes] - Thank God you're here. I didn't get a text back from you, but I just decided to come anyway. - Wait, no, I did text you back. - Oh no. Damn it. Did I lose my phone? - Do you think she has it? - Shit. - [knocking] - Hi. - Yes? - Liv left her phone at the restaurant. Is she here? Landon, listen, I know we got off on the wrong foot, but can I come in and talk to you for a moment? Just a moment, please. I wanted to apologize for our session, since I clearly upset you. - Five minutes. - I don't mean to make you uncomfortable. I really don't. It's just that you are such an amazing and accomplished man, and I understand you much better than Liv ever could. Don't get me wrong, Landon. Liv is lovely. But a man like you needs so much more than that. You need a woman that understands what it feels like to be successful. Who understand your needs. ♪ She could never love you like I love you. - Whoa, what the fuck are you doing? - I'm taking back what's mine. I know you feel it. I can't be the only one. - Wait, wait. Taura? [grunts] - Look what you made me do, Landon. All I've ever wanted to do was please you, and all you've ever done was throw me away. I thought that if I came back, you'd remember what we had. Our love, our passion. No one had chemistry like we did, Landon. Remember? - Taura. You look so different. - Better. Landon, I look better. Come on. Thanks to total reconstructive surgery after you threw me off the fucking roof. - Whoa. No, no, Taura, you fell off the roof. I did not throw you. - Oh, wow. The lies you've told yourself. Wow. I tried to move on with my life. I got my education. I became successful. People respect me, Landon. - OK. - But you, you had to go and fuck with me, flaunting that bitch all over the goddamn television. "My life was nothing before I met her." Liv's the only woman you've ever loved, Landon? Huh? Mother of your children. Hmm. Where are the kids? Where are they? Hello? It's pretty quiet. Oh yeah. I forgot. By the way, our son survived. He's 16. He looks so much like you. That's right. You've been a father all along. If only you had picked me, you could have raised the son you've always dreamt of having. But here's still time for us, Landon. I can forgive you if you're truly sorry. You can choose me. Be a father to our son. But if you choose her, there will be consequences. - I love Liv. I will always love Liv, because Liv is my family. - It's obvious to me you're not thinking clearly right now. I understand. This all just happened. I get it. I'll give you some time to think. OK? [glass shatters] [tense music] ♪ - Come on, Landon. - Nothing's coming up in my system. It's like the bitch doesn't even exist. - This is crazy. - Bingo. - Taura Bridges. - Liv. - Oh shit.

Charlotte traced her DNA to Taura Bridges, the high school girlfriend you didn't tell me about. - I know, babe. I'm so, so sorry. I just, I thought I could just leave it all behind me. - Well, it's in front of us now. I haven't heard from Jayce. I'm sure she had something to do with it. So spill it now. - Taura Bridges is my ex-fiancé. We got engaged our senior year of high school. And a couple of months later, I don't know, she just became a different person. She was angry, and she was violent. I mean, some of these outbursts, they were borderline psychotic. Nobody knew what was going on, and it just kept getting worse and worse. So I mean, I felt like I needed to get out. I called the wedding off. A couple of months after that, she broke into my college dorm room. - Landon! [screams] Landon. There's something I need to show you. - Taura, I did not know that you were having a baby. - You left me pregnant and alone and embarrassed in front of everybody. - Please, please, just let me explain. - Just tell me you love me and you can live to see your kid. If not, you're not going to make it through the night. - Please. Listen, look, I'm begging you, OK? You don't have to do this. - It's already been done. I can't undo what I'm about to do to you, and you can't undo what you did to me. - I'm sorry. Babe, just listen to me, OK? Look, you don't want the baby, our baby, you don't want them to think that their mother is a killer, right? Please. I'm so sorry. Please, just put it down. No! - [screams] - Oh, shit. So I moved hundreds of miles away. I transferred to Howard, and I just wanted to move on with my life and just act like none of it ever happened. But the dreams, you know, they were always there to remind me. And then last night she tells me my son is still alive. - Oh my God. So you have been keeping this TV drama from me for years. - I know. I'm sorry. [phone buzzes] - It's her. "Come get your brother." - No. No, we need to call the police. - I already tried that. - I know what this woman is capable of. - When it comes to my family, do you know what I'm capable of? Let's go. Jayce. What the fuck? Jayce, are you here? - Good girl, Liv. You brought Landon. Landon, have you thought about what we discussed? - What did you do to my brother? - Oh, you mean before or after I fucked his brains out? - Taura, your issue is not with Liv. And it's not with Jayce. It's with me. Right? - Damn right. - I know that I hurt you, and I'm sorry. OK? But I know that we can figure something out. And hopefully in time, you can reintroduce me to our son. - Now you want to meet your son? - If I would have known, I would have always been there for him. You know that. - Taura, just do the right thing. - Shut up. All your pathetic ass has ever done was keep him from having a child of his own. Our son is fine without you. - OK. OK. Taura, you need help, OK? - I don't need help! - Landon. [grunts] We have to make a tourniquet. Fuck. Come here. Put this on tight. Hurry. Come on. It's OK. We have to get out of here. - Behind you. Run, run, run, run. - See? I told you. I would never have left you, Landon. - If you touch her, I'll kill you. - I told you there would be consequences for choosing her. - Jayce. Jayce. Oh my God.
