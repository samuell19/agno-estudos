"2008" Have you seen the news? Is it real? If it's true, I'm so dead. What did Taedong say? Let's go talk to him. Let's eat. What's going on? Taedong, what happened? What do you mean? You idiot, it was a scam! "Tree of Life Church" -What is going on? -Please calm down. -Tell me what's going on! -I didn't know either! Tell me it's not real. It's all over! Where is Jang Doochil? Where's my money? He fled with my money too! I'm so screwed! Wait, so we can't get our money back? Let's drop it. No more. What? Honey wake up! Honey. Asshole, you vouched for him! Are you on his side? We're dead without that money! -Give our money back! -Taedong! Let go of him! You okay? Are you hurt? Mom... How could you do this to him? Aunt, we're all broke! Taedong said it was our last chance! Taedong even put... ...the death benefit of his father! What? Everyone... Uncle... I'm sorry. A man jumped to his death in Youngcheon last night. He was a victim of the biggest Ponzi scheme in history. Police estimates the victims from the 23 multi-phase firms Jang founded, are over 30,000 and resulted in more than 10 suicides so far. Kim Injung reports. Stop there, you son of a bitch! I said stop! You're so dead! You jerk! Stop! You jerk! You rat! Bastard! Hey! The one with the hat! Get out of the way! "Where is Jang Doochil who stole four billion dollars?" You little... That rat! Look over there. I'll kill him! That was close. How the hell did they find out? It's all over, once you're caught. Then I won't get caught. They can't turn me in since they're fences. Not a shred of business ethics. Ta-da! One for you. One is real and the other is fake. -Right one. -Sure? You're still good. Mr Night Fog! As expected. You're good. I'll be a good son and take the fake one. Like hell you are. It's quite nice for a fake. What are you hiding? -Jang Doochil? -Give it to me! My goodness. You said you're retired. This is my last job. Look at his face! He's got the slanted eyes of a crook. How did everyone trust him with their money, without any doubts? They doubted a thousand times. That's why they get conned. Doubts become assurance once it's dispelled. I'll be late. Don't wait up. Dad, should I tag along? No, kiddo. No need to get your life in a knot. See you soon. Transfer to a Chinese ship in international water, they'll take you to Dalian city. Don't come to me even if you fail. You can't go in! Step back! You should stay out! What's going on? -Get him out! -You can't be here! -Get out! -Let go of me. Dad, wake up! -Get out! -Dad! -Get out! -I should've tagged along! Let go of me! Dad! Dad! "Autopsy found no signs of foul play..." "Suicide" "Confirmation of Suspicious Death" Jang Doochil, the man behind four billion dollar fraud case, is reported to have fled to China. Police estimates that Jang took off with two billion dollars, and requested Interpol's immediate assistance. It's been a month since Jang fled to China, but his whereabouts are still unknown. His victims are voicing their complaints. Breaking news. Jang Doochil was said to have died in China last December. Police obtained clips of his funeral and his death certificate, they're currently verifying... Despite the police statement, many witnesses came forward about Jang being alive. Believing that he faked his death, the victims are holding protests to reopen the case. "The Swindlers" "8 Years Later" So nice! It'll be perfect with my wedding dress! -Don't you agree? -Sure. It's perfect for you. This is my store's most prized jewel. I better beg my fiance when he comes. Could you recommend it? Sure thing. That's nice too. Can I try that? Sure. Choonja. Hey, baby. It's been a while. Dammit. I'm here too. Nice to see you. Dammit. Detective Kim, go easy! Shut it. You got me into so much shit. Is this it? -Yes. -Need to take a photo. Sure. Thank you, sir. If it weren't for you, I could've been in a big trouble. Not at all, sir. You acted so naturally. You can be an actor. No way. I was nervous. My legs are still trembling. Look at this! Thought you could get me again? I can never drop my guard with you. Thank you. Could you come in for a statement? Sure. Anytime. -Thank you. -Thank you! -Good bye. -Thank you, bye. Damn, Detective Kim. What should I do? I couldn't help it... Detective Lee! Good job, you son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! We got a show and got paid. That was thrilling. Did you see him getting a peek? Why did you say my name? Are you nuts? No worries! He would never think that it was your real name! -Right? -Her name doesn't match her looks. The evidence is solid. It'll take the heat, so handle it swiftly. Who are you? Do not disturb! Who the hell are you? Seoul Prosecutor's Office, Park Heesu. This is the warrant for your arrest. What? Where the hell do you think this is? Get him out! Come out! Watch your mouth. You son of a bitch. Do you know what is this? The evidence that Jang Doochil bribed you. You took quite a lot. The ledger revealed that Superintendent Kim Takyun, was paid off for 1.2 million dollars over five different occasions. Is the ledger much rumored Jang's bribery list? Yes, it is. We'll dig deeper into it for additional assailants. Is he alive? I mean Jang Doochil, you're in charge of this case. I believe the police confirmed his death a few years back. Then why do we keep hearing stories that he's alive? I wish the rumors were true, so that I could catch him. Sir, Prosecutor Park is here. Come sit down. I'll leave you guys alone. We managed to calm the public this time, but we can't afford anymore rumors surrounding the list. There's no more scapegoat to use. It will go away soon. Did you find the leak? Jang Doochil's man named Lee Kangseok is the one. Could he have the real list? He's just a small timer. Then lock him up before he blabbers any further. Also, see if he's got the real list. How long must I cover your ass? Hey. If this shit hits the fan, you'll take the biggest fall. Be cool. When Councilor Sung assumes power... ...you're a made man. I'll do what I'm told. "Restricted Area" Hello, sir. New necklace? It was her birthday so we had a small event... I told you to keep your heads down. Sorry, sir. Did you dig into Lee Kangseok? Sure. I scanned him. Let's go inside. We looked into him. He's a crazy piece of shit. What do you mean? -Too shady. -How? -He's like you. -Piss off! Shut your face. He spent three years in prison for working with Jang, and he got involved with various scams thereafter. He recently hooked a pushover and is pulling a real estate scam. He's nothing. Why are you after this petty crook? I just need him locked up to shut him up. Then you can just arrest him. I'll catch him with the police, and you guys go to his house and look for any ledgers. Yes, sir. Who the hell are you? Who told you to come in? Listen, prosecutor, I'm the victim here! Illegal foreign exchange in May. Bogus stock last month. You were in the middle of a real estate scam. On Choi Changsik. Where the hell is that old fart? How should I know? But you should. That bastard conned me! Son of a bitch! I met that old fart for the first time at a foreclosure auction. I have an eye for suckers, and I knew it as soon as I saw him. -Wait sir. -An ideal sucker! This is the deciding factor. The sooner he calls, the easier the job. Sure enough he called me within a day. A major sucker! Mr Choi! He was supposed to pay 500 million won in advance. Please give me three more days. What happened? It's so sudden. It's the money I inherited in the States, but the bank refuses to transfer due to some loans. Why don't you pay the debt first? -It's more than one million won. -I see. What do we need now? It's push and pull! So, I pushed him hard. The deal is off unless you wire the money today. Then sell it to someone else. You can't... I spent a lot already to set up the agency! Mr Choi, wait! So one million won will do? It'll take 20 minutes. You're a lucky guy to meet someone like me! I need to go to the washroom. That's when I felt weird. I have a special instinct for that. I'm going too. -I'll see you outside. -Okay. That toilet didn't have a window. And I was right outside the washroom. Mr Choi, you are taking... What the heck? Damn! How could he? Cheating the swindler? He has no job ethics! He should be skinned alive! Did you find anyhing? We're at Lee's house. But it's been ransacked! Do you recognize him? Not a clue. He's not from our field. Play the security video by the washroom. Stop. Rewind. Rewind. Stop there. When did he go in? Well... He didn't go in. -That bastard! -Who the hell is he? That's the bastard who only cons the swindlers! You caught me because he set me up! Sir, he ransacked Lee's house. He left the bank and came to Lee's house. Look at this guy... I got you, bastard! Don't send him to jail but let me take care of him! Where did he go afterwards? Okay, I got him. The address is 1606, Donghwa condominium. What? Damn, he's gone. Sir, the parking lot! He's leaving! -Direct me. -Wait a minute. Find him there. Let me see. Come out, come out, wherever you are. Look at this! That's the one. Wait. That's him. He's waiting to make a left turn at Myungji intersection. It's a black Sonata. It's the next block. He's turning left now. We turned left too. He's waiting for the left turn at Joongang junction. Okay, we got him! Come out! Come out! Why's the window so heavily tinted? -What the hell! -Sorry? That's not my car. Turn right! Turn left in front of the convenient store. I got no visuals in that area. You found me faster than I thought. You know me? I saw you taking Lee Kangseok. You don't look like a detective. Guess you're a prosecutor? You were watching me? You're interesting. Long time no see. How have you been, you son of a bitch? Hey. Hey. I rotted in jail for a year... ...because of you, bastard! What did you take from Lee's house? Are you looking for something? Why didn't you take off after the job? What was the real reason you conned Lee? He's just a bait. -To reel another. -Who? You don't wanna know... Do I? Jang Doochil. Jang Doochil? You bastard. -He died a long time ago. -Yes, he died... ...officially. You also believe that false rumor? It's not a rumor. I met him. He's known to have died in China, but he left China after faking his own death. I wandered many countries to find him... ...and finally found his right-hand man. Four years ago in Thailand. I thought I finally had him... ...but I moved too hastily. He was standing in front of me... ...but there was nothing I could do. That was it. I managed to escape... ...but that was the last time I saw him. So? You were gonna bait Jang with Lee? For God's sake. Do you think you're a superhero? I am not catching him. I just need to meet him once. Just once. So that I can kill him. Hwang Jisung, 33 years old. No criminal record. He's clean. Immigration records show he was in Thailand four years ago. Any family? His father committed suicide in 2008. He's got no relatives aymore. Seeing our young people giving up their own lives, the children who are fed up with competitions, and the ordinary people, who can't escape poverty, my tears flowed and I was convinced. Citizens of Korea, I, Sung Yongjae... ...declare my Presidential candidacy to make Korea a better nation for all! -Sung Yongjae! -Sung Yongjae! The reaction was incredible. Tugging the heartstrings was the deciding factor. Don't worry about the media. I'll make the big stir! Let's drink. Prosecutor Park. Is something bothering you? Jang Doochil is alive. Why do you bring it up here? We've got a witness. Then take care of it as usual. It won't stop here. More witnesses will come forward. Dammit... We shouldn't have let him leave Korea alive. Let's get rid of him. Prosecutor Park. Don't make this into a big deal. I'm not. I want to root out the source of our trouble. Be honest. You just don't want to be known as Jang's prosecutor. He just wants to erase his past. It's not just my past. -What? -How dare you? That's enough. Prosecutor Park, we're on the same team. Just take care of the witnesses, okay? Damn bastards! They're too stupid for politics! I won't be a fool at your hands. If you're gonna kill me, do it now. What's your plan to reel in Jang? It's none of your business. Why are you so obsessed? Nothing changes by killing him. Nothing changes? Would you utter the same shit, if your father died too? Let's get him. Let's get Jang Doochil. You and I? We're after the same thing. Jang Doochil's death. But I have one condition. I'll kill him myself. It's Jang Doochil we're talking about! If this goes bad, you're totally screwed! Then how could we live? So? But more than anything, I can't work with that bastard! I won't! Don't do it, if you're not up to it. If you want to run, just run. I haven't made up my mind... But... If you're not sure, don't bark. Are we all good? Let's clear one thing first. I'll set up the plan and we'll do it my way. Okay? -No problem. -What? Okay. Okay? Okay. Let's get Lee first. What are you saying? He's locked up. -I'll get him out tomorrow. -No. It's a new setup, this is a team game now. How about a beating? How could you beat me? I'm your senior! You hit me first! Also I warned you about pocketing the collection! No respect for the thief! It's not pocketing! I doubled your money! By blowing off one million dollars? I wanted to pay back your money all at once! Lee will perk up when we talk money. Ignore him at first. -Excuse me... -Jisung! Let's be honest, I did it for both of us. I'm fed up with your excuses. Don't ever talk to me! You want me to beg you? Desperately? You want to die? Over my dead body! I'm on my knees. You can't see, but I really am. Jisung! You're rich, so this means nothing, but I'm... ... nothing without you! I swear! I'm your faithful dog now! I'll follow your orders. Stop it! Fine, enough. This is your last chance. What's the bait? Throw him his favorite. Real estate. Listen, Jisung. To redeem myself, I'll bring you something big. It's real estate, are you interested? -The best business in Korea. -I'll take care of it myself. You just don't mess around. I got it, I'll behave. The investigation is over. Let Lee Kangseok out. Hello there! You're a fine gentleman. You look familiar. Have we met before? Bye for now. Yes, he's on your tail. He'll background check me, is everything in order? Of course. He'll try to eat you alive. Just be careful. -Afternoon. -Hello, hello! -Win much today? -You know what it's like. -Good luck. -Thanks. Gosh! Oh, hello again! Do I know you? You don't recognize me? At the lockup... Oh, right. "For Lease, Purchasing Songjung Tower" Thank you for calling JM Assets. Sure, should I put you through? I know it's your first time but don't get nervous. Could you give her a call, and pretend to talk to each other. -And also... -He's here, get ready! Relax and try to be natural! And don't forget to greet that bastard, I mean, the CEO. This can't be just a coincidence. -Really? -Sure. The brotherhood between cellmates is stronger than that of soldiers. Bars rather than guns. It was my first time there. I heard that from somebody. It was my first time too. Speaking of which, I overheard you were looking into real estate. No, I'm through with it. I was scammed recently. Oh, gosh. My father who lived in the States... ...just passed away. He left me some inheritance... Isn't that how he got scammed? But nowhere to invest that money. Is that so? I shouldn't say this on our first meeting. No, forget it. Come on, we're already like brothers. Well, because it's illegal. I love it. Illegal stuff! Wow, you're a real man! The truth is, I've been looking for a partner. Partner? Concerning my casino. The return is good but requires a large capital. -How much? -One billion won. The return on investment is 80 percent within six months. A billion? One billion won, you say... Perhaps I was being too haste. Just forget what I said. No, Mr Hwang! I guess you're really lucky. Meeting someone like me. Please give me more details. The sooner he calls, the easier the job, eh? It didn't even take five minutes. He's a major sucker. Hello, Mr Lim. The reason I'm calling is... The time has come! It's the big score. Trust me and lend me one million dollars... Hello? Hello? He's a nervous wreck. He can't even bait one person. Would you? Think for once. Why do you hate me? There's only one person who has that money. Jang Doochil. He's a persistent prick. He's making a phone call! Who are you calling? It's an international call. Boss, it's Kangseok. I told you not to call. -Sorry, sir. -Jang? -Shush! -It's urgent. Could you please... ...lend me one million dollars? I said I'll pay you back later. It's Jang's right-hand man, from Lee's hometown. We can make eight billion won in six months! What is it? This guy's a money launderer. I want to run a casino with him. Money launderer? Yes, he seems like... No, he's a big shot! Real big! Wait. Yes, sir. It's Kangseok. It's me. -How have you been? -That's him! Sir, how are you? It's been a while. So, he's a money launderer? Yes, sir. Listen, Kangseok. You know I don't trust people easily. -But sir... -I'll send someone over. Let him take care of it. You'll get your cut. I see. Thank you, sir. Good work. He's not dead. It's really Jang! This is nuts! He cheated his own death? Unbelievable. -Location? -Somewhere in Thailand. He used relays to mask his coordinates, so his exact location isn't clear. -You met him in Thailand? -Yes. Who is he sending over? Whoever it is, we need to lure him. Kwak Seunggun. He's a hotshot businessman with no criminal records. No evident connection to Jang Doochil. He'd never send someone who can be traced back to him. He must be rooted out. This is my godfather's casino. At first it was for Koreans, but as you see, over 90 percent of the clientele is Chinese. They go apeshit for gambling. They come with big bucks, so the casino's booming, but there's not enough people to manage it. -Jackpot! -It's a jackpot! Congratulations! This is my specialty. I do money laundering for my godfather and I get a cut. We raked in foreign money and doubled it. No, tripled it in six months. This is what we call... ...a jackpot! The terms are very good. We were lucky to meet Mr Hwang! It's perfect for a con. Is there a problem? Who'd give these terms to someone you just met? It's a jackpot if you run it yourself. It will be called greed if I handle the management too. I only do the money laundering. That's what makes it so strange. If something goes wrong, we'll be held legally responsible. We're screwed. Say that we'll take legal heat too. Tell me. Why did you approach us? So, you want money... ...without any responsibility? Hell... What the hell are you doing? There's no limit to your greed. Let's forget the whole thing. Mr Hwang. Mr Hwang, wait! Damn it... My gosh. Excuse me. Hey! You can't just walk away like that! We got to catch Jang! -Isn't it strange? -What is? He saw the terms... ...before coming here. He was never interested in the deal. Right. Had I offered better terms, he'd be even more suspicious. Then why did he come? There's only one reason. What is it? To test us. There must be another reason. They live really complicated lives. They have so many suspicions. It's okay. Doubts become assurance... ...once they're dispelled. Kwak applied for several incorporations, could he be starting a new business? It's Jang, he did the same thing nine years ago. It's a good chance. He'll call Jang with even the slightest problems. Good, so we'll create a problem for him to report! So... What's your plan? My gosh. Let's try individual play. The main operator will be Choonja. -Great! -Don't bluff! I don't believe you. No, my boyfriend told me. Really? Good evening. My apology for yesterday. Who is he? He is... ...a scary guy. I want it back. What do you mean? My wallet. What are you doing? I don't want to touch you. Just give it to me. If you're so confident, search me yourself. Can somebody call the police? It's nothing at all, excuse us. Is this your wallet, sir? I'm sorry. I really am. My sincere apologies! How can I make it up to you? Please wait. Thank you. You must have been very shocked, yesterday. It's okay, I'm over it. Anyway do I look like a thief? No, it's just... May I buy you a drink? To get Jang's location, we need to spy on Kwak continuously. Keep him occupied, while we search his place. Got it. How much time do you need? Not long, I'll be quick. You can never drink, got that? -I'm just worried. -Piss off. I'm counting on you. Please, that's my limit. What? -Just a bit more... -No. I might make stupid mistakes... ...if I drink one more glass. Check, please. It could take a few hours. It's going to be tough, right? Are you kidding? I can lure him for life. You're too much. What? Today is... Today is... Yes, baby? Do you want to die? What's taking so long? Ten minutes, just hold on. You have to be quick... ...because I drank! What? Damn it! I must not laugh... You idiot! No laughing! Sorry. You'd better stop drinking. I can't... ...keep it together today... ...without drinking. Do you mind if I ask what today means to you? You should really stop... You're a real cutie! You really are quite drunk. Are you alright? Wake up! Suzy? Suzy? I'll go to Thailand while she's on him. Thailand? That's where Jang's based. If he's starting a business, his men will be on the move. Hey, are you trying to flee? Should I go with him? You got a job to do here. What job? Could you put out an article? Sir! I just want to make something clear, don't ever trust that prick. He's always hiding a step. I never trust a swindler. You should know better. Why are you so busy? I didn't know we had an interview. We don't need to have an interview to chat. I dropped by to say hello. Were we that close? Why did you release Lee Kangseok? The innocent must be set free. You just let him go? He could be a pawn. -Whose? -How should I know? I don't know either. Reporter Choi. Write an article, not a novel. Good morning, sir. Find out what Reporter Choi is up to. Yes, sir. Damn it... Here she comes. Good job, baby. It's Jisung. Have you arrived? Yes, I'm in Bangkok. I'll look for local brokers who dealt with Jang. Report every hour. Will do. Let me know how Kwak reacts to the news. The call came from Thailand. Ta-da! Fancy another drink? Don't I look like a girl to you? You do. Am I not attractive? More than enough. Then what is it? Be a man and put your arm around me, and turn on the TV... -Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. -And talk about current affairs too. This is the 8 PM news. Do you remember 2008's Jang Doochil case? Jang was said to have died in 2011 in China. But there has been reports of him being alive recently. Han Seunghwan reports. -What is it? -Shush! I was at a diner in Bangkok about a week ago. He spoke Korean and looked familiar. He talked about Interpol or something. Then someone called him "Chairman Jang," and it hit me,"That's Jang Doochil!" Who's Jang Doochil? Think I've heard that name. Excuse me for a minute. Where are you going? Jang died of a heart attack in December 2011, and his ashes were transported to Korea. -Yes? -Sir. Did you watch the news? We got him! I'm outside. What is it? It was about someone spotting you. What are you talking about? That couldn't have been possible lately. Your face was on the news, so please take some precaution. No worries. Who could still recognize me? Anyway, could you come out? I'm nearby. I'll see you at the rendezvous point. What? Is he in Korea? I'm very sorry. Follow that car, please. Sir, I'm in the taxi now. Which way? One second. Towards Namsan Tunnel One through Ulji-ro. Where the hell is he going? He's heading up the hill on a side road. He got off. Where? The Seoul Tower. Sir. It's really Jang Doochil, sir! Can we bug him? It's on now. Wow, what a view! Isn't it beautiful? There's no place like my home country. What brought you to Seoul? I had some business at the Hill. But you should stay low for a while... Cut it out. The media is all bark and no bite. Did you meet the guy Lee introduced? He's not greedy, so he's trustworthy. Don't trust him too much though. Loyalty follows the money. Yes, sir. Come to Incheon on Sunday. I've got something for you. Yes, I'll see you on Sunday. Please hurry! They're leaving! Damn it... This way! This way! This way! Sir! He's taking the cable car! -Excuse me, sir! -Hey! Goddammit! Gosh. Where's Kwak? He's just back at the hotel. Let's grab him now! I'll make him tell where Jang is! Did we find out anything? Well, I'm sure they'll meet again. Come to Incheon on Sunday. I've got something for you. Yes, I will see you on Sunday. Incheon? I don't believe it! What is it? Reporter Choi is meeting with that swindler Hwang. What are you talking about? "Talking about Jang's bribery list" What? He's not in Thailand? But he called from there? Yes, the origin was confirmed as Thailand. He could've faked it, then. This was all calculated! We shouldn't have trusted him! Dig in. Dig what? Find out what he's really been up to! Okay. While you were covering this story, you haven't seen the real list? It'd have been an exclusive had I seen it. I have some suspects but no proof. You're saying that only Jang... ...can confirm who got bribed? There's one other person who knows about the list. Who is it? Prosecutor Park Heesu, who's in charge of this case, I've been poking around him. Do you know him? Seeing from his e-mails, he's been digging around about the bribery list. That's why he met reporter Choi. What else? His father who killed himself, he wasn't a victim of a scam, but a swindler. A swindler? Yes, his name is Hwang Yooseok... ...who's also known as "Night Fog" in our line of work. It's no big deal. Do it one last time. Sir, I'm really done with this. Hey, Night Fog. Don't you want to enjoy your retirement with your family? Just help smuggle him out of Magumpo Port. Wrap things up nicely for me. Sir, I'll take this to my grave. Trust me, I'm Night Fog, I'm a man of my words! I will never ever... Hello. Get back to Seoul now. Jang turned up. Where? In Korea? Where is he now? I don't know yet. Kwak will meet him again. I'll take the first flight tomorrow. Find anything over there? They took off a while ago, I didn't get much. I understand. It's tomorrow. Can you do it? I better. I promised to kill him with my own hands. You want him dead, right? Make it look like Jisung and Jang shot each other. Pardon? You'll be a free man from that moment. They left. We're following them with GPS. You can move ahead. Okay. We'll join you at the Incheon tollgate. You get nervous too? You must be happy, everything will end today. Let's do it. They turned right, keep your distance. We're in Chinatown. Alright, we're in, too. We'll be on their tail after the intersection. Got it. He's making a stop, we'll just pass. He went into a restaurant. It must be the place. Sir. You're here Yes. Are you exercising? Yes, wait a bit. Yes, sir. It's not the restaurant, there's no other noise. It's the basement, let's move. Yes, sir. Standby nearby. Move in if something goes wrong. We'll wipe them out at your signal. I found it. I'll check it out. I need a diversion. My God! That's cold! -My goodness! -Are you okay, miss? Don't touch me! I'll clean it for you. I'm so sorry. It's clean. What? The door is locked. Wait until they come out. Handle it as quietly as possible. So, how's the preparation going? I will contact him soon. Here, the certificates of deposit. Let him handle it. 10 billion won could be too risky. Launder it, it's been eight long years. How much would you like to launder in Korea this time? 300 billion won. Make no mistake. We're leaving Korea for good. Yes, sir. I'll come find you once it's done. Alright, thanks. Okay. They will come out soon, get ready. Wait. Pull out. What are you talking about? Do as I say, pull out now! -Now! -No. I'm ending this now. Ko Seokdong! 300 billion won... Can you handle this? We found his hideout, we can move in anytime. Okay. Once this thing wraps, I'll make you Prosecutor General. I don't need that anymore. Once you become the President, hand over your district to me. Sure, a man must have big ambitions. Hey! What the hell? -Hey! -That was our chance! We get the money first. You want to scam Jang? You're a crazy bastard. You guys go ahead, I'll go kill him though. On your own? Do you really think you can? Why? Do you want to kill me? Then who'll contact Kwak and get the money? Don't be too greedy. I will never do it. You don't need the bribery list? You weren't in Thailand, you dug around with Choi. That's right. Did you think that I'd be done after killing Jang? I'll kill everyone who were bribed and helped Jang flee. I will give you that list. There's one other person who knows about the list. If you get the list... ...and kill Jang... ...then you got everything you wanted. You think I will buy that? It's your call. I'd like to apologize for our last meeting. I'm sorry. The deal is off the table. I'll get to the point. Liquidate our CDs. "Certificate of Deposit" Are you kidding me? For 100 million won, you can take it to any banks. Don't mess with him. We got a lot more. How many? How much can you liquidate? Give me your best shot. 300 CDs. Excuse me for a second. Where's that bastard going? What? You don't want the list? Let's raise the stakes to 300 billion won. But our cut is 50 percent. Deal? Or should I call it quits? Thirty percent... ...and the bribery list. Deal! You can all take 10 percent each, I just want the list. If a large sum is liquidated in a short period, it'll be flagged. I want a safe route. Then we go through the private loan market. That's my specialty. It will take two weeks, my commission is 10 percent. Can you do it in a week? Take it. Yes. Thank you. Is this all? Thirty billion won for low level punks? It's a total rip-off. Where's the rest? After this is all over. We have to give him real money on the first deal, then we get the rest of his 270 billion won. I'll take care of it. How will you make him entrust us with the rest? Kwak will start shell corporations with the laundered money. When funneling money as capital, there'll be less suspicion, so he'll launder the rest himself. I knew it, that's pretty obvious. If his plan goes awry, we become his only way. Lure him to our trap? It's your turn. Show us how much power you can muster. Take them all. What is it? Search warrant, please comply. "I e-mailed you Jang's list" "Lee Gil-su/Maritime police/ Jang Doochil Escapes with 200K" "Jang's Bribery List Revealed" Jang Doochil's bribery list was revealed by Hansin Daily. It names dozens of civil servants in public sectors. This list will have wide implications going forward. "The list is out, please call me." The Jang's bribery list was leaked by an outlet this morning, has not been verified, as the outlet refuses to provide us with their source. "Prosecutor General Office" What the hell have you done? You said you took care of it! Where did it come from? This won't end just with your dismissal! I never told you to stir up the media. They're just small timers. It's the only way to kill him and get the money too. Are you sure you can handle this? Jang's the one who'll take the heat. They'll be forced to go all-in. Sir! Kwak's gone! Our bugs and GPS aren't picking him up. His number is dead. Did he get scared and flee to Thailand? Don't jinx it! Why else would he sever all communication? We're closed for today... Hey! You son of a bitch! What's your plan now? What's your next move, bastard! "Restricted Number" I should probably answer that. It's Kwak Seunggun. Mr Kwak? I had to change the number due to an urgent matter. Is there a problem? I have to fly out on an urgent business. Can you prepare 30 billion won by tomorrow? Tomorrow? If you can do it, I'll entrust you with the rest of our funds. How much is that? 270 billion won. Alright. I'll try my best. Thank you, I will call you again. As expected, they'll take off with the money. And the cash? Can you get it ready? We hand them 30 billion won and get the rest of CDs. Do whatever it takes to find Jang... ...by using Kwak. I need some cash by tomorrow morning. What? Thirty million dollars. Pool the money you all received from Jang. I'll cover the rest. Hey, what do you think you're doing? Do you think you're safe with Councilor Sung's support? Then pull out. You son of... You crazy bastard! What do you think I'm doing here? I'm trying to clean up your goddamn shit! Do your damn part at the very least. Work. Got it? If you want to keep what you got. Okay? Yes, sir. We can secure the funds by tomorrow. What are you going to do about the media? One of Jang's men has been bragging about the list. We'll say he leaked the fake list, and the buzz will die soon. It's not a big deal. Drink it. But, sir... Have I done anything wrong? Write this down. I won't allow any shame until the day I die, even a gust of wind pained me terribly. Shit! You sons of bitches! You bastard! "Suicide Note" Why? Why? Why did you have to spread baseless rumors? I will tell you everything! That bastard told me to! Open it. Say it again. Please don't kill me! Please, sir! I was paid to do what I did. What? That bastard Choi Changsik! You'll get double, if you spread the rumor about the list. But you said he conned you. He promised me more money after my release from jail, and just disappeared. He approached you on purpose? Please don't kill me! 270 billion won, when can you do it? Such big sum takes time. I must fly out tomorrow night. I'll get you as much as I can first. Where is the rendezvous point? Magumpo Port. They're smuggling out. We'll finish Jang tomorrow at Magumpo. No need for that. Gotcha! Yes? We found him. Bring me Jang, dead or alive. Yes, sir. So we got the money and we got Jang too. There's no need for you anymore. It hurts, doesn't it? Why? Something's broken? No, it's not. You should've behaved yourself. How do you feel? You regret it a bit now? Spend the rest... ...of your life cleaning others' shit. You cheap bastard. Conniving son of a bitch! Watch your mouth! How dare you talk back at me? Keep running your mouth. Yes, is it done? Sir, Jang has disappeared. And the money's gone too. We missed him slipping out this way, sorry sir. I am really sorry, sir. Don't fool around everywhere, just come to Magumpo Port tomorrow with your gang. Yes, sir. "Caller ID Blocked" Who is it? So, the rats on my tail were your men? Jang Doochil! What? Do you want to kill me? Damn, I can never trust anyone. As if taking my money wasn't enough? You are not afraid of me? Damn you! Hey, Jang Doochil! Do I look like a chump because I spared you? Do you think I'm easy? Crazy bastard! So, you don't mind releasing my ledger then? Suit yourself. It will freak out the old farts, but it won't hurt me. I will kill you, though. I'm so scared. Was I right? You son of a bitch! What are you doing now? have you gone made? Don't be confused. Mr Jung, we have nothing to do with it. -What should I do? -What is this... Should I release the list with your permission? It will be a bloodbath. Mr Jang, don't make this into a big deal. That hurts my feelings. That depends on how you deal with your barking mutt. No more mistakes. If you don't take care of this, it will be the end for you too. Park, get back here now! I'll deliver you Jang's head. Lure Jang to Magumpo Port tomorrow. Crazy son of a bitch. Do you think I'll do it? You will die if you don't. You'll kill me anyway. That's right. Would you like to die now or after killing Jang? Are you not going to get your revenge? Are you okay? Stop here and run away. You should live. That's right, do as she said. Unlike you, we can't flee anyway. No. I have to finish this. You got the wrong person. The man who killed your father is someone else. That bastard lured my father, and killed him, to shut him up for good. Good bye, sir. I'm sorry for not telling you. I need your help. Surprised? Prosecutor Park had that. That's right, those are copies. Are you okay with everything? What do you want? Why don't we talk face-to-face? Men are all the same... Prosecutor General said the same thing. Fine, but come alone. In a lump sum, in US dollar. Okay! But it's quite a sum this time? We can't do it all at once. Five billion won in advance, and the rest in six months. We're here. It's the warehouse next to the dock. I will see you in a bit. He'll arrive soon. Great, then it's all done now? Give us our share and the list. List? What list? You're a dead man, what do you need it for? You'll regret this. You don't mind me exposing... ...what you've done? You're going all-out over this, right? I retrieved all documents meant for the media. Ko Seokdong, you bastard. Thanks for your service. Get rid of them. Wait, please! Wait! Sir! Hey, Jung. Prosecutor Park, what are you trying to pull? These look so real, I almost got fooled. What are you talking about? What am I talking about? These are counterfeits! The deal's off! I need my advance back, you'll need to pay some penalty. If you mess with me again, I'll end you. Understood? Goddammit! Sir, they're here. Hey, Jang Doochil... Jang Doochil... You dare try to fool me? Where's the money, you bastard? What's this? Did I surprise you? You trusted me? A swindler? Don't trust that prick. He's always hiding a step. Let's clear one thing first. I'll set up the plan and we'll do it my way. I'll go to Thailand while she's on him. What? He's not in Thailand? He's meeting that swindler. You son of a bitch! Hey! Hey! Jang Doo... That's enough. Ko Seokdong. Hey... Taedong! Taedong! How the hell... Taedong! Honey! No! Please no! You can't do this! You're saying this prosecutor... ...helped Jang run away? Let's just kill them all! Killing them is easy. My dad told me. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. I'll fool them over and over again, and make them pay. Do a year for all of us. Okay. At least I don't have to worry about food. I rotted in jail for a year because of you, bastard! It grows every single day. We will grow it into a successful company... Here, the certificates of deposit. How much would you like to launder in Korea this time? 300 billion won. You don't need the bribery list? Thanks to your greed, we got everything we wanted. 30 billion won. Now the world will know what you've done. What do you think? Sounds fun, doesn't it? That's all? You planned all this over a petty swindler? Shoot me. Shoot! Pull the trigger, you bastard! Do you think Night Fog died because of me? No. Several powerful men were blindsided by Jang, and they killed him to cover it all up. They control the media, do you think truth will prevail? So what? Give me the evidence. I will get them all. There's no need for that. Thank you for waiting. You son of a bitch! You're backstabbing us after all we did for you? I'll make it up to you. I'll get Jang no matter what, and compensate his victims by creating a law, so please give me a chance! Freeze! Drop your weapons! Hands in the air! Over here please! Do you have anything to say? You scored a big scoop! It's an utter chaos! What are you staring at? Surprised? Shit, I feel so good. What's up? Big news! An online broadcast went live at 9:30 PM. The video is going viral and is causing a stir. The broadcast is still live, which shows Presidential candidate... Prosecutor Park Heesu confessed his involvement... Let go! Enjoy it. It will be hell until the day you die. I'm surprised! When did you get out? Did you have a hard time? I brought something good. It's tofu. You got old really fast. You'll be single for good. Right, honey? What is this? Why are you all here? He lost touch with the game. Can't you tell? There's one more bastard left. You have to be the mastermind.
