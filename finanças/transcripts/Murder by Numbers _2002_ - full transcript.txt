First man: SHOULD WE SAY THE WORDS ONE LAST TIME? ONE CANNOT LIVE FULLY WITHOUT EMBRACING SUICIDE AND CRIME. SAY IT. Second man: A PACT MADE WITH RELENTLESS FIRE THAT REQUIRES THAT WHILE SOME LIVE, OTHERS DIE. ON 3. ONE... 2... 3. [GUNSHOT] EACH OF US HAS WITHIN US A WEAK ASPECT, EAGER TO GIVE UP FREEDOM FOR THE COMFORT OF BEING DOMINATED, BUT WE ALSO HAVE A WILL TO POWER THAT DESIRES FREEDOM, THAT INSISTS ON DECIDING FOR OURSELVES, EACH OF US, INDIVIDUALLY, WHAT IS GOOD AND WHAT IS EVIL. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS? DOESN'T ANYONE WANNA CHALLENGE JUSTIN'S THESIS? ARE YOU ALL WILLING TO SUBMIT TO THIS DARWINIAN STRUGGLE OF COMPETING EVILS? I GOT A QUESTION. Teacher: AH, MR. HAYWOOD, YOU'RE AWAKE. [CLASS CHUCKLES] LET'S HEAR IT. UH, YEAH. WHAT'S A DORK LIKE YOU KNOW ABOUT POWER? WHAT WOULD AN IGNORAMUS LIKE YOU KNOW ABOUT PHILOSOPHY? Teacher: KEEP IT CIVIL, PLEASE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT CRIME? Teacher: GOOD QUESTION. YOU SHOULD WAKE UP MORE OFTEN, HAYWOOD. WHAT ABOUT IT, JUSTIN? Justin: ALL REAL FREEDOM RISKS CRIME. INDEED, FREEDOM IS CRIME BECAUSE IT THINKS FIRST OF ITSELF AND NOT OF THE GROUP. THANK YOU, JUSTIN. VERY DARING. THANK YOU. [ALL LAUGH] Teacher: FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE SOURCE OF MR. PENDLETON'S REPORT, MIGHT WANNA TAKE A LOOK AT THE WORKS OF FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE. YOU REALLY NEED TO GET LAID, BONAPARTE. Teacher: BY LOOKING AT BOOK ONE OF THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA. [GASPS] HEY, JUSTIN. REMEMBER ME? WHAT DO YOU WANT? [COCKS GUN] I WANNA BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT... AND I'M GONNA MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A SUICIDE. EVERYONE WILL BELIEVE IT, 'CAUSE IF THEY WERE YOU, THEY'D KILL THEMSELVES, TOO. MMM, YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH IT. YOUR SHOE PRINTS, FIRST OF ALL, ARE A VERY UNIQUE PATTERN. THEY'D BE TRACED BACK TO YOU IN A MATTER OF DAYS. THE FIBERS ON YOUR SHIRT ARE ALL OVER ME NOW. YOUR HAIR, TOO. IT'S CALLED TRANSFERENCE. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, YOUR FINGERPRINTS ON MY NECK... WHERE YOU TOUCHED ME. YOU CAN'T GET FINGERPRINTS OFF OF SKIN. YEAH, YOU CAN. WITH A MAGNA BRUSH OR A FINGERPRINT CHEM OR AN IODINE GUN AND SILVER TRANSFER SHEETS. BELIEVE ME, RICHARD, YOU DON'T HAVE THE DISCIPLINE TO COMMIT A MURDER AND GET AWAY WITH IT. IS THAT RIGHT? WELL, LET'S SEE. BANG! YOU'RE DEAD. [CHUCKLES] WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG? DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG I'VE BEEN WAITING? NO. I HAVE SOMETHING BETTER. Richard: WHAT IS IT? ABSINTHE: WORMWOOD INFUSED ALCOHOL. THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO TETRAHEDRAL CHLORINE.

EVEN BETTER. TO THE SYSTEMATIC DERANGEMENT OF OUR SENSES. OH, FORGET THE SENSES. LET'S DERANGE THE WORLD. [CLINK] WE WILL. WHEN? SOON. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT? WHAT ABOUT RIGHT NOW? ACTUALLY, I HAVE, UM, A BIOLOGY EXPERIMENT... OH, FUCK YOUR BIOLOGY... YOU ALWAYS HAVE EXCUSES. YOU KNOW THAT? LET'S JUST FORGET IT. FORGET WHAT? WE'VE BEEN PLANNING THIS FOR MONTHS. I'M SICK OF PLANNING. THAT'S ALL IT IS WITH YOU. IT'S TALK AND PLANS AND DREAMS. YOU'RE A JERK-OFF. SO JERK OFF. RICHARD, WAIT. JUST BE PATIENT. Dispatcher on radio: WHAT'S YOUR STATUS? HERE COMES THE HYENA. HEY, WHY'D YOU TELL 'EM NOT TO LET ME INSIDE THE PERIMETER? DON'T GET PISSY ON ME. I TOLD THEM NOT TO LET ANYBODY IN. IT'S YOUR FIRST HOMICIDE. I DIDN'T WANT YOU STEPPIN' ON YOUR TONGUE. HERE, TAKE THIS. WHAT IS IT? A VERY IMPORTANT CRIME SCENE TOOL. HEY, BOYS, SNACK TIME. GET ONE OF THE UNIFORMS TO SET UP A STAGING AREA.

AH, FINGER SHAPED MARKS AROUND THE NECK. OH, LOOK AT THIS. A CLEAN CUT. A TROPHY? THAT WOULD BE MY GUESS. DEFENSIVE WOUNDS. SHE PUT UP A FIGHT. GOOD FOR YOU. WE'RE DEALING WITH A SECONDARY CRIME SCENE HERE. WHY? WELL, THIS HEAD WOUND WOULD PRODUCE EXTENSIVE AMOUNTS OF THICK BLOOD, BUT THERE'S VERY LITTLE HERE. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE? PIQUERISM? PRE OR POSTMORTEM? POST. NO BLOOD. AH. NOT BAD, VICE. PROBABLY DID REALLY WELL ON YOUR DETECTIVE'S EXAM. [SIGHS] ALL RIGHT. THE WIND IS PICKING UP. WE'RE GONNA START LOSING EVIDENCE. WE GOTTA HOLD ON TO EVERYTHING WE CAN GET. ANY IDEA WHO SHE IS? NO. NO CAR. NOBODY FOUND ANY ID. JANE DOE. Lisa: HEY, BONAPARTE. BONAPARTE, WHAT'S THE MATTER? Teacher: MS. MILLS. Teacher: ALL RIGHT. TIME'S UP. PUT YOUR PENS DOWN AND EXCHANGE YOUR TESTS WITH A NEIGHBOR. I DID HORRIBLE. NUMBER 20 IS C: BERT NORTON. I SUPPOSE YOU FIND IT FUNNY. WHAT? ME FLUNKING A POP QUIZ. YOU DIDN'T FLUNK.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S ONLY GONNA GET WORSE, I WARN YOU. YOU BEEN TALKING TO THE BOYS? I'VE HEARD A FEW THINGS. YEAH? THEY TELL YOU WHY I WAS CALLED "THE HYENA?" NO, WHY?

UNLESS YOU'VE PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO IT. MISSING RING FINGER. WHAT'S THAT, A RITUAL? SERIAL KILLER? MAYBE A COMMENT ON MATRIMONY. THAT'S PROBABLY A NEGATIVE COMMENT. YOU THINK? HUH.

Sam: RULE NUMBER ONE: TALK TO THE NEIGHBORS. MMM. LOOK, YOU SAID "A LITTLE LATE." IT'S BEEN MORE THAN 3 HOURS. IS THIS ABOUT THE D.A.? WHAT'S HIS NAME, SWANSON? THAT ASSHOLE? NO. [LAUGHS] HE SEEMED OK. YEAH, WELL, TRY DATING HIM. HE GOT A LITTLE ROUGH WITH ME ONCE, SO I BROKE HIS NOSE WITH THE CAT. THE CAT. WELL, THE CERAMIC CAT. UH, NO, THANKS. GOOD. NOW YOU CAN WALK ME HOME. SURE. THANK YOU. SIT DOWN. I SHOULD GET GOIN'. MMM, WHAT'S THE RUSH? UH... UM... CAN I, UH, ASK YOU A PERSONAL QUESTION? [CLEARS THROAT] I CAN HARDLY WAIT. HOW DID YOU GET INTO THIS WORK? I MEAN, HOW-- WHY HOMICIDE? BECAUSE SOMEBODY I KNEW WAS MURDERED, AND I GOT INTERESTED IN THE PROCESS. REALLY? NO. [LAUGHS] I'M JUST BULLSHITTIN' YOU. IT'S JUST THE KIND OF CRAP PEOPLE LIKE TO HEAR. WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'? IT'S CALLED SEX. IT'S FUN, AND YOU SHOULD TRY IT. LOOK. WAIT. WE'RE PARTNERS. WE GOTTA WORK TOGETHER. THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA. DON'T WORRY. I WON'T GET POSSESSIVE. WAIT. OH, WAIT. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? OH, 'CAUSE I WANT TO. WHAT ABOUT WHAT I WANT? WHAT DO YOU WANT? RIGHT NOW? YEAH. THIS. MMM. MMM. WAIT. LET'S NOT HURRY. NO, NO, NO, NO. JUST LEAVE THAT-- LEAVE THAT ALONE. JUST THAT. PLEASE. SURE. MMM. MMM. WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU GOTTA GET UP. YOU GOTTA GO. WHY? BECAUSE I GOTTA GET SOME SLEEP.

I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. GOOD NIGHT. Justin: THE EVIDENCE IS SO TINY, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT IF YOU HELD IT IN YOUR HAND. A FEW COMMON YELLOW CARPET FIBERS, SOME RED CARPET FIBERS AND SOME HAIR. THAT'S IT. THE FIBERS WILL BE SUBJECTED TO INFRARED SPECTROPHOTOMETRY TO DETERMINE THEIR GENERIC AND SUB-GENERIC CLASSES, THEN COMPARED AGAINST THE DATABASE TO DETERMINE THE MANUFACTURER, BUT THAT WON'T BE MUCH HELP. YELLOW CARPET FIBERS, CONSISTENT WITH A MASS-PRODUCED LINE OF THE TRIACETATE VARIETY. MANUFACTURED OUT OF DENVER, DISTRIBUTED ALL OVER THE WESTERN UNITED STATES UNDER SEVERAL DIFFERENT BRAND NAMES. NO HELP. SAME WITH THE RED FIBERS. SEVERAL LUSTROUS TRILOBAL NYLON FIBERS ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER RED DELUSTERED FIBERS WILL BE EXAMINED AND MATCHED WITH THE BRANDS. SOLD BY HANOVER SAMPSON FOR SEVERAL WHOLESALE DISCOUNT STORES. OH. THAT NARROWS IT DOWN. THEY SOLD 50,000 OF THEM IN THAT COLOR LAST YEAR. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF THE CUTICLE, THE CORTEX, AND THE MEDULLA OF THE HAIR WILL REVEAL THEM TO BE HUMAN IN ORIGIN. 2 BROWN HUMAN HEAD HAIRS. DEFINITELY NOT THE VICTIM'S. Justin: ALL BUT ONE. THIS ONE WILL BAFFLE THEM, BUT IT WILL ALL MAKE SENSE LATER. ONE HAIR OF NONHUMAN ORIGIN. SCALE PATTERN OF THE HAIR MATCHES THAT OF CYNOCEPHALUS MAIMON. IT'S A FREAKIN' BABOON HAIR. NO FINGERPRINTS, NO MURDER WEAPON. THEY'LL HAVE THEIR WORK CUT OUT FOR THEM. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE PAID FOR, RIGHT? Sam: HERE IT IS. CORONER SAID STRANGULATION WAS SLOW, PERHAPS THE VICTIM WAS BEING TORTURED. UM, THAT THE POSTMORTEM STAB WOUNDS BARELY BROKE THE SURFACE. THEY WERE TENTATIVE. OK, THAT'S IT. ONCE THEY PUT IT ALL TOGETHER, THEY'LL DECIDE THAT, GIVEN THE SLOPPY NATURE OF THE CRIME SCENE-- THE POSTMORTEM MUTILATION-- THE PROFILE WILL LEAN TOWARDS THAT OF A DISORGANIZED OFFENDER. POOR SOCIAL SKILLS. Justin: NOCTURNAL BY NATURE. PROBABLY INTO PORNOGRAPHY. Justin: ABOVE AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE, BUT UNEDUCATED. LIVES ALONE. LIMITED RELATIONS WITH WOMEN. ATTACK WAS SPONTANEOUS. UNPLANNED. EXCEPT, HE DIDN'T DRIVE DOWN CLOSE TO THE DUMP SPOT. THAT IS PLANNING. BUT HE LEFT THE FOOTPRINTS. NONE OF THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE WILL LEAD TO THE SUSPECT, BUT THEY WILL DAMN HIM WHEN HE IS DISCOVERED. WHEN WILL THEY HAVE A SUSPECT? THEY SHOULD BE EATING OUT OF OUR HANDS RIGHT ABOUT NOW. Richard: POOR RAY. HE'LL NEVER SEE IT COMING. CASSIE, LOOK AT THIS. "VIGI BOOTS." WHAT THE HELL ARE VIGI BOOTS? THERE HE IS, IN THE BLACK COAT. DON'T LET HIM CHARM YOU TOO MUCH. RICHARD HAYWOOD? CASSIE MAYWEATHER, SAM KENNEDY. SAN BENITO POLICE. CAN WE TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE? YEAH, SURE. SO, YOU'RE WILLING TO SPEAK TO US WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY PRESENT? SURE. WHERE WERE YOU LAST THURSDAY NIGHT? YOU THINK YOU COULD TELL ME WHAT THIS IS ABOUT? WE'LL GET TO THAT. JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION. I WAS CRAMMING FOR THIS CALCULUS MID-TERM. I WAS WITH A STUDY GROUP. HOW LONG? FROM ABOUT 7:00 UNTIL 3:00 FRIDAY MORNING. THAT'S QUITE A CRAM SESSION. YEAH, WELL... YOU KNOW, I GOT KIND OF A SPOTTY RECORD. I GOT TO KEEP MY GRADES UP FOR COLLEGE. CAN YOU GIVE US THE NAMES OF THE OTHER PEOPLE THERE? YEAH. SURE. AM I IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE? YOU SEEM VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT YOUR APPEARANCE, RICHARD. THANKS. I LIKE YOUR OUTFIT, TOO. SHE LOOKS GOOD. IT'S LIKE, UH--LIKE, UH... FEMININE, BUT IT STILL MANAGES TO BE PROFESSIONAL. IS THAT LIKE, A-- LIKE, A PLEATHER? KMART. WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN IS YOUR SHOES, RICHARD. LET'S TALK ABOUT THESE. VIGIs? YOU OWN A PAIR OF THESE? UH... YOU BOUGHT THEM AT, UH, SCARLATTI'S, DOWNTOWN SANTA BARBARA, FOR $637.50... ON YOUR PLATINUM BANK CARD. SIZE 12-D. THIS CAN'T BE ABOUT MY SHOES. Cassie: WHY NOT? THIS IS ABOUT MY SHOES? [CHUCKLES] WHEW. YOU GOT ME FREAKED OUT LIKE I DID SOMETHING. JEEZ. DID YOU FIND THEM OR WHAT? I REPORTED THEM STOLEN FROM MY LOCKER, LIKE, 3 WEEKS AGO. I EVEN FILED A REPORT WITH THE FRONT OFFICE. WELL, DID YOU FIND THOSE SHOES OR NOT? OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK YOU SHOULD TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON. 'CAUSE I'M... SPINNING OUT HERE. SHOE PRINTS MATCHING THESE WERE FOUND AT THE SCENE OF A MURDER LAST WEEK. WHAT, THE COVINGTON WOMAN? THAT'S RIGHT. SO, YOU THINK THAT THE PERSON THAT STOLE MY SHOES COMMITTED THIS MURDER? WELL, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M GONNA COOPERATE IN ANY WAY THAT I CAN. YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO MIGHT HAVE STOLEN YOUR BOOTS? NO, I DON'T. I WISH I DID NOW, THOUGH. HEH HEH. ANY ENEMIES AT SCHOOL? OH, WELL, IT'S HIGH SCHOOL. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? COME ON. I DON'T WANT TO SOUND ARROGANT, BUT THERE'S PEOPLE AT THIS SCHOOL WHO ENVY ME. REALLY? YEAH. WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? WELL, LET'S JUST SAY THAT I'M VERY FORTUNATE, AND I'VE BEEN BLESSED IN MANY WAYS. MUST BE NICE BEING YOU, RICHARD. I GOT NO COMPLAINTS. IT ALL CHECKED OUT. HE FILED A REPORT ABOUT THE BOOTS, JUST LIKE HE SAID, AND HE MADE A PRETTY BIG FUSS ABOUT IT, ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPAL. YEAH, I BET HE WAS A PAIN IN THE ASS. WELL, SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT. NO, BELIEVE ME. I HATE KIDS LIKE THAT. LIKE WHAT? CASSIE... WHAT ABOUT THE STUDY SESSION? 6 KIDS--6 KIDS WERE AT HIS HOUSE WITH HIM, UH, FROM APPROXIMATELY 7:00, 7:30 THURSDAY EVENING TILL 3:00 a.m. FRIDAY. I TALKED TO ALL OF THEM. THEY ALL SAID HE WAS THERE THE WHOLE TIME, EXCEPT FOR 15 MINUTES, WHEN HE WENT TO A LOCAL ATM TO GET CASH FOR SOME PIZZA THEY'D ORDERED. DID YOU CHECK THAT OUT? YEAH, HE WITHDREW $40 AT 9:19. GET THAT ENHANCED. WHY? BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE HIS FACE. WELL, IT'S HIM. I CAN'T SEE HIS FACE. YOU REALLY THINK HE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS? I DON'T KNOW. BUT SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT WITH THAT KID. WELL, LOOK, 15 MINUTES-- IT DOESN'T GIVE HIM ENOUGH TIME. HE'S GOT TO DRIVE UP TO COVINGTON, KILL THE WOMAN, DUMP HER BODY IN MARIPOSAS WOODS AND GET BACK. HE'D NEED AT LEAST AN HOUR. [CLINKING] THEY QUESTIONED ME. AND? AND IT WAS SO COOL. DID THEY GO FOR THE SHOES? OH, THEY GRABBED IT. I WAS SO GOOD. I REALLY WAS. LISTEN... Richard, on tape: THIS CAN'T BE ABOUT MY SHOES. Cassie: WHY NOT? Richard: DID YOU FIND THEM OR WHAT? YOU SURE THEY DIDN'T SUSPECT ANYTHING? I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T OVERDO IT? A LITTLE BIT. I OVERDID IT A LITTLE BIT. Richard: SO, YOU THINK THAT THE PERSON THAT STOLE MY SHOES COMMITTED THIS MURDER? WELL, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M GONNA COOPERATE IN ANY WAY THAT I CAN. YOU KNOW? [LAUGHS] MEET ME AT THE BLUFF TONIGHT. I'M GONNA TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT. OH, I CAN'T. WHY NOT? I--I HAVE SOMETHING TO DO. LIKE WHAT? I'LL TELL YOU LATER. I--I SHOULD... DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS KID'S FATHER IS? Cassie: I DON'T GIVE A SHIT. I WANT TO SEARCH THE HOUSE. LAWRENCE HAYWOOD. HE BUILT THE HILLSDALE MALL. BIG CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTOR, ROD? THAT'S RIGHT, CASSIE. AND I AM NOT ABOUT TO FUCK WITH A GUY LIKE THAT ON ANYTHING AS FLIMSY AS THIS. I'VE GROWN MUCH TOO FOND OF MY OWN ASS TO DO ANYTHING THAT GODDAMN STUPID. [SIGHS] AND WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM? Rod: WHERE ARE YOU ON THIS, SAM? I DON'T CARE WHO HIS FATHER IS, EITHER. THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M ASKING. DO YOU THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH TO GO AFTER THIS KID? NO. AND IF WE GO IN TOO SOON, I THINK WE COULD BURN THE WHOLE CASE. OH, REALLY? AND WHY IS THAT, VICE? Swanson: LOOK, I DON'T THINK THERE'S A JUDGE IN THE COUNTY WHO'S GONNA SIGN A WARRANT ON THE BASIS OF-- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? SHUT UP, SWANSON. LOOK, ROD, I'M TELLING YOU THIS KID WITH HIS DICK HEAD ATTITUDE AND-- LOOK, HIS ATTITUDE ISN'T A CRIME. IT IS AN INDICATOR. IT'S A PERSONALITY TYPE THAT'S VERY CAPABLE OF DOING-- HE DOESN'T FIT THE PROFILE-- YEAH, THE PROFILE DOESN'T FIT THE PROFILE! THE KILLER HAS ENOUGH SMARTS NOT TO DRIVE THE CAR DOWN TO THE DUMP SITE, THE FORESIGHT TO STEAL RICHARD'S BOOTS AND USE THEM INSTEAD OF HIS OWN, BUT THE ATTACK WAS SPONTANEOUS AND UNPLANNED? OK, BUT IF YOU'RE RIGHT AND WE PUSH TOO SOON-- ROD, WHOSE CASE IS THIS? WHOSE CASE IS THIS? CALM DOWN, PLEASE. NO, I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND OLIVIA'S KILLER. OK? I'M BUSTING MY ASS NIGHT AND DAY-- OLIVIA? WHO THE HELL IS OLIVIA? THE VICTIM. IS THIS STILL MY INVESTIGATION? IT'S A COORDINATED EFFORT. YOU'RE GETTING WAY TOO INVOLVED IN THIS, CASSIE. CASSIE? WHAT? YOU CALLED HER BY HER FIRST NAME. I'M SORRY. WHAT? YOU SAID, "I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND OLIVIA'S KILLER." NO, I DIDN'T. DID I? YEAH, YOU DID. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IDENTIFYING WITH THE KILLER, NOT THE VICTIM. YOU REMEMBER THAT? [DOOR SLAMS] Matlock, on TV: YOU DON'T HAVE ANY WITNESSES OR FINGERPRINTS OR POWDER BURNS OR... [KNOCK ON DOOR] Man, on TV: TOBIAS ALWAYS KEPT A GUN RIGHT HERE. LOADED. CAN I COME IN? WITHIN EASY REACH OF ANYBODY SITTING AT THIS DESK. [LOWERS VOLUME] LISTEN-- LISTEN, I'M SORRY I DIDN'T BACK YOU UP IN THERE. HEY, I'M A BIG GIRL. YOU SAID WHAT YOU THOUGHT, RIGHT? YES, BUT IT-- WELL, THEN, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING. YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T JUST BUST IN THERE-- YEAH, I KNOW. I HEARD YOU WITH ROD. SO, CAN YOU GET OUT OF THE WAY? YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS? YEAH, IT'S THAT YOU'RE BLOCKING MATLOCK. NOW CAN YOU GET OUT OF THE WAY? PLEASE? I'M JUST--I'M TRYING TO APOLOGIZE HERE. ALL RIGHT. APOLOGY ACCEPTED. YOU WANT TO SIT DOWN? WANT TO HAVE A COOKIE? HI. HI. WHAT'S GOING ON? MMM, I'M MAKING UP. WE'RE STILL FRIENDS, RIGHT? WHAT--WHAT'S THIS? I DON'T KNOW. LET'S FIND OUT. SO, WHAT HAPPENS? WE DO THIS AND YOU THROW ME OUT AGAIN? OR YOU STAY. OR, THIS TIME, YOU LEAVE. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S REALLY HARD TO TELL IN ADVANCE. WHAT DO YOU WANT, HUH? YOU WANT--YOU WANT PROMISES? YOU WANT A RING? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? DO YOU WANT A RING? DON'T. ALL RIGHT? LOOK, IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT SEX. OK? I REALLY RESPECT YOU AS A PERSON. IS THAT WHAT YOU-- WHY DO YOU ALWAYS WANT TO HURT PEOPLE? I WOULDN'T SAY ALWAYS. IT JUST KIND OF HAPPENS SOMETIMES. YOU--YOU'RE SO-- YOU'RE SO GOOD AT BREAKING OTHER PEOPLE DOWN. BUT YOU NEVER STOP AND TAKE A LOOK AT YOURSELF. THE NEIGHBOR HEARD 2 SHOTS. ONLY ONE SLUG WAS EVER FOUND. THE OTHER-- [SHUTS OFF TV] ALL RIGHT. [GIGGLES] WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME? NO PEEKING. WE'RE ALMOST THERE. STEP UP. OK. OPEN YOUR EYES. OH, MY GOD. JUSTIN, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. DID YOU GROW THESE?

YOU SEE, I COMPILED A LIST OF EVERYONE AT THE SCHOOL, STUDENTS AND STAFF, WHO MIGHT HAVE STOLEN RICHARD HAYWOOD'S BOOTS. THEN I CROSS-INDEXED THAT AGAINST CARPET PURCHASES, AND OUT CAME THIS. APPARENTLY, HE SOLD GRASS TO THE KIDS AT SCHOOL. GOOD WORK. THANK YOU. WHERE IS HE? I DON'T KNOW. HE SEEMS LIKE HE TOOK OFF. DID YOU RUN HIM FOR PRIORS? YEAH. A COUPLE D.U.I.s. ONE MINOR POT BUST, BUT HE HASN'T SHOWN UP FOR WORK SINCE THE DAY WE TALKED TO RICHARD HAYWOOD OVER THERE. DID YOU FIND THE BOOTS? NOT YET, BUT WE MAY HAVE A MATCH ON THE YELLOW CARPET FIBERS. WE WON'T GET ANYTHING ON THE VEHICLE FIBERS, YOU KNOW, TILL WE FIND HIS CAR. BUT HE'S GOT A BIG, BIG, COLLECTION OF PORNO FILMS. MOSTLY BONDAGE. Both: JUST LIKE THE PROFILE. YEAH. WHAT? [SQUISH] WELL, HE'S NOT A NEATNESS FREAK. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? HE'S SLOPPY ENOUGH TO LEAVE BEHIND FOOTPRINTS OF STOLEN SHOES, BUT HE'S SMART ENOUGH TO STEAL THEM IN ADVANCE? OH, COME ON, CASSIE. THIS IS OUR GUY--NO QUESTION. YEAH, THAT'S GREAT. YOU FIND ANY CAVIAR JARS? OH, COME ON. WAIT A MINUTE. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE TICKED THAT I GOT HIM, AREN'T YOU? NO, IF YOU GOT HIM, I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

DON'T WORRY, I WON'T CONTAMINATE ANY EVIDENCE. SHE PEES STANDING UP, THAT ONE. AL... Sam: THIS IS MY PARTNER. DON'T TALK ABOUT HER LIKE THAT, PLEASE. YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING WITH HER ALREADY, ARE YOU? WHAT? YOU WILL. THAT'S CASSIE'S M.O. SHE LETS YOU GET CLOSE AND THEN SHE PUSHES YOU AWAY. YOU ASK HER WHAT'S WRONG, SHE PICKS A FIGHT. WHY DO YOU THINK YOU'RE WORKING WITH HER? NO ONE ELSE WILL. [SNICKERS] [CRASH, CLANG] [SCREECHING] AAH! [SQUEALING] Cassie: LOOKS LIKE A BODY DUMP. Man: DON'T LOCK THAT DOOR, JEFF! I'M NOT GOING OUT THAT DOOR! Radio: WHAT'S THE VICTIM'S STATUS? OVER.

OF COURSE NOT. DID YOU FUCK HER? I WAS HELPING HER WITH HER PHYSICS-- YOU FUCKED HER. I SAW YOU FUCK HER. WE KISSED. YOU KISSED? THAT WAS IT, I SWEAR. AH, JUSTIN. YOU HELPED LISA, AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN GET LAID? WHAT A SHMUCK. SHE'S NOT LIKE THAT. BULLSHIT. THAT CHICK SPREADS LIKE PEANUT BUTTER. I THINK YOU'D BE SURPRISED WHAT A GIRL WITHOUT A DADDY'LL DO FOR A LITTLE MALE ATTENTION. [HEAVY BREATHING] Richard: OH, YOU'RE SO PRETTY. [TELEPHONE RINGING] [RING] [RING] [RING] Richard: DO YOU HATE ME? I HAD TO DO IT. THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS HURT YOU, BUT I HAD TO SHOW YOU WHAT SHE'S REALLY LIKE. AND THAT'S WHAT SHE'S LIKE. SHE'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU. SHE DOESN'T APPRECIATE YOU. SHE JUST--SHE'S LIKE YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR FATHER AND EVERYONE ELSE. I'M THE ONLY PERSON WHO REALLY CARES ABOUT YOU. YOU KNOW, I THINK I'M, LIKE, THE ONLY PERSON WHO SEES HOW INCREDIBLE YOU REALLY ARE. DON'T--DON'T GO AWAY, JUSTIN. COME ON. WHAT WE DID... TOGETHER... MAN, HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DONE THAT? WE PROVED SOMETHING TO EACH OTHER. WE SHOWED WHAT WE'RE CAPABLE OF. THERE'S NO LIMITS FOR MEN LIKE US. DID YOU HEAR ABOUT RAY? THEY'RE ON TO HIM. JUST ONE LAST THING TO DO, AND THEN WE'RE HOME FREE. RIGHT? DO WE HAVE TO? YOU TELL ME. DO WE HAVE TO? RICHARD? IS THAT YOU? WHAT'D YOU BRING, THE POMPOMS? SHH. I BROUGHT SOMETHING TO HELP YOU SLEEP. WHAT THE FUCK? [BANG, SPLATTER] MY PHYSICS TEST. I GOT A B+. YOU'RE A GENIUS. DON'T. HEY, I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU. WHAT IS THIS? YOU'RE QUITE THE SLUT. WHAT? HEY! WHAT?! [GIRLS GASP] MMM. [SIGHS] HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN IN HERE? NURSE ON THE NIGHT SHIFT SAID HE CAME IN ABOUT 4:00. [SAM GRUNTS] HOW YOU FEELING? OH, I'M OK. I'M A LITTLE SORE, BUT... WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I--YOU KNOW. FIGURED YOU'D WANT AN IMMEDIATE REPORT. OH... YEAH, I DO. SO... WE GOT EVERYTHING. EXCELLENT. THE BOOTS? THAT'S AN AFFIRMATIVE. AND A PAIR OF TIN SNIPS AND A PHILLIPS HEAD. ALL THE TRACES OF BLOOD. AND A FINGER, RIGHT? WAS IT IN A JAR BEHIND A STACK OF OLD MAGAZINES, OR WAS IT IN THE FREEZER UNDER THE FROZEN TURKEY THIGH? BEHIND THE VANILLA FUDGE ICE CREAM. HMM. WELL, GOOD WORK. ALL YOU NEED NOW IS A CONFESSION. WELL, THERE WON'T BE ONE. RAYMOND FEATHERS COMMITTED SUICIDE LAST NIGHT. SUICIDE? YEAH. IT WAS A GUN TO THE HEAD. POWDER BURNS, G.S.R. ON HIS RIGHT HAND. YEAH, WELL, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HEARD OF A RITUAL MUTILATOR, AN IMPULSIVE, SERIAL-TYPE KILLER, COMMITTING SUICIDE? UHH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I CAN'T THINK OF ONE. PSYCHOS WANT TO GET CAUGHT. OH, WAIT. YOU GOT TO LIE DOWN. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M ACTUALLY FEELING A LOT BETTER. THANK YOU. WELL, I-- I THINK THESE KIDS DID THIS, AND I THINK THEY'RE NOT EVEN HIDING IT, AND I THINK THEY WANT US TO KNOW. SO, LET'S GET TO KNOW THEM A LITTLE BETTER. TURN AROUND. I WANT TO GET DRESSED. OH, COME ON, WE GOT RAY ALL OVER THIS THING. PLUS, HE RAN. WHY DID HE RUN IF HE DIDN'T DO IT? I DON'T KNOW, BUT THERE'S A REASON. IS THIS JEALOUSY 'CAUSE I GOT HIM AND YOU DIDN'T? OR ARE YOU SO OBSESSED WITH RICHARD HAYWOOD YOU CAN'T EVEN THINK STRAIGHT? LOOK, I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T-- GET OFF OF ME. YOU'VE BEEN ANGLING FOR THIS THE WHOLE TIME. PUSH ME OUT, TAKE OVER-- PUSH YOU OUT? I TRIED TO TURN IT DOWN. THEY MADE ME TAKE IT, 'CAUSE THEY THINK YOU'RE LOSING IT. WHO THINKS I'M LOSING IT? WHO? ROD? YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T CARE IF I'M LOSING IT. I'M RIGHT. [DOG BARKING] Woman: HEY! HEY! [CALLING DOG] Woman: HOW DID YOU COME BY THIS? WELL, IT WAS THE WEIRDEST THING. I WAS DRIVING BY THE HOUSE, A TRASH CAN GOT KNOCKED OVER, AND, UH... THE STUFF WAS BLOWING OVER IN THE STREET. WHAT A BREAK. SOME OF THIS WILL BE THE MOTHER'S AND SOME WILL BE FROM THE BOY. WHAT IS THIS? IS THIS... DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL. WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL WE GET THE REPORT BACK, SEE WHAT, IF ANYTHING, MATCHES THE DNA OF THE PUKE. LUCKY YOUR KID WAS SO SQUEAMISH. HE GAVE US SOME BLOOD WITH HIS DINNER. JUST MAKE SURE YOU GET A SIGNED PURCHASE ORDER. HOW LONG BEFORE WE SEE ITS MATCH? DEPENDS ON THE LAB. DO WANT ME TO CALL THEM FOR YOU? NO! LAST TIME YOU CALLED, IT TOOK ME HALF AN HOUR TO CALM THE GUY DOWN. WELL, JUST MAKE IT FAST, ALL RIGHT? BYE. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. OK. SEE YA. WHAT'S THIS? IT'S A PURCHASE ORDER FOR THE DNA ANALYSIS. I KNOW WHAT IT IS. THIS CASE IS CLOSED. CLOSED! NOW, IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT, THEN MAYBE WE-- YOU NEED SOME TIME OFF? NOPE. I'M FINE. YOU'RE NOT FINE. YOU'RE BRILLIANT SOMETIMES, BUT YOU'RE NEVER REALLY FINE, ARE YOU, CASS? YOU WANNA SEE DOC SLUZER AGAIN? NO. THEN NO MORE ON THIS CASE. NOT ANOTHER MINUTE. NOT ANOTHER PENNY. I'VE ABOUT HAD IT WITH YOU. YOU HEAR ME? YEP. HEY, CORETTA, IT'S CASS. LISTEN, I'M GONNA NEED ANOTHER DAY OR TWO ON THAT PURCHASE ORDER. NO, NO, NO, JUST BOOKKEEPING, YOU KNOW. CHANGE IN THE SOFTWARE, THINGS LIKE THAT. YEAH. SO YOU'LL GO AHEAD AND RUN AN ANALYSIS ON THAT PUKE FOR ME? THANKS, HONEY. [HANGS UP] [SIGHS] ROD, I'M SORRY. I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT-- ROD, I'M SORRY! COME ON. Richard: YOU THREW UP? WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER DOING IT. HE DOESN'T REMEMBER IT. WELL, WHAT IF THEY I.D. YOU... WITH THE... DNA OR SOMETHING? CAN THEY DO THAT? I DOUBT IT. I MEAN, THE STOMACH ACIDS USUALLY EAT AWAY AT WHATEVER-- YOU DOUBT IT? I DOUBT IT. THIS COULD PUT US IN THE FUCKING ELECTRIC CHAIR, AND YOU DOUBT IT? GAS CHAMBER. WHAT? CALIFORNIA USES THE GAS CHAMBER. OH, THAT'S-- THAT'S VERY INFORMATIVE. IT DOESN'T MATTER. NO, THANKS. THANK YOU. AND YOU TOLD HER THAT YOU TUTORED ME, TOO? GOD, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? I WAS THINKING THAT IF SHE FOUND OUT ON HER OWN AND I HADN'T MENTIONED IT, IT WOULD LOOK EVEN WORSE. THEY HAVE NOTHING. THEY HAVE NOTHING ON ME. DON'T WORRY. I'M NOT A BACK-STABBER LIKE YOU, RICHARD. I'M THE BACK... [LAUGHS] HOW AM I A BACK-- I'M NOT THE ONE TALKING, JUSTIN. I'M NOT THE ONE GIVING AWAY ALL THE INFORMATION! I'M NOT THE ONE TRYING TO GET US CAUGHT 'CAUSE I'M A SCARED LITTLE BITCH WHO FEELS GUILTY! DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT, OK? I'LL TALK TO YOU ANY WAY I WANT TO. I TRUST YOU, I DEPEND ON YOU FOR ALL THIS FORENSIC STUFF, AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT! YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE SMART ONE. STOP. JUST... NO. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SMART. YOU'RE DUMB! STOP! I'M SORRY. COME HERE. THAT'S A GOOD BOY. HA. YOU'RE NOT STILL MAD ABOUT THAT GIRL, ARE YOU? HUH? LET'S JUST STICK TOGETHER AND STAY CALM UNTIL THIS IS OVER, OK? AND THEN WHAT? AND THEN WHAT? JUSTIN? WHERE ARE YOU GOING? HEY. Justin: WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE SEEN TOGETHER. DO YOU THINK THIS IS SOME KIND OF GAME OR WHAT? [TELEPHONE LINE RINGS] COME ON, COME ON, COME ON. Machine: THIS IS SAM KENNEDY. I'M NOT HERE TO TAKE YOUR CALL. I'LL CALL YOU BACK AS SOON AS I-- [CLOSES PHONE] RICHARD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? DO YOU WANT SOMETHING? LIKE WHAT? I DON'T KNOW. EVERYBODY WANTS SOMETHING, DON'T THEY? DO THEY? THEY JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO ASK FOR IT. WHAT DO YOU WANT? YOU THINK I'M TOO YOUNG, DON'T YOU? THERE WAS A KILLER AT YOUR SCHOOL... THE WHOLE TIME, SOMEBODY YOU WERE CLOSE TO. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? RAYMOND FEATHERS? YOU GUYS WERE FRIENDS, RIGHT? WHAT, WITH THAT DEGENERATE? NO. HE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE MANY FRIENDS. HE JUST... I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, EVEN HIS-- HIS OLD LADY LEFT HIM. SO YOU WERE FRIENDS WITH HIS OLD LADY, TOO, HUH? YOU'RE A TEASE. I THINK YOU LEAD GUYS ON AND THEN YOU PUSH THEM AWAY. BUT I THINK... YOU LIKE TO FIGHT. I THINK YOU REALLY WANT IT. YOU JUST KINDA NEED TO FIGHT ABOUT IT. NO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING. YOU HAVE NO CHOICE. I'LL DO IT ALL. NOW YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT, SO YOU'RE LEAVING, RIGHT? THIS IS PART OF IT. THIS IS ALL PART OF IT. DAMN IT. NO. [GROANS] OH... THANK YOU, DETECTIVE. I BET YOU DID THIS WITH EVERY GUY YOU EVER DATED. TELL ME I'M WRONG. [CHUCKLES] [BUZZER, KNOCKING] [KNOCKING] WHAT IF I CAN LINK RICHARD TO RAYMOND FEATHERS? YOU CAN'T STOP, CAN YOU? NO, SAM, SAM. LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT WHAT I SAID TO YOU. I'M JUST A LITTLE MESSED UP RIGHT NOW, BUT IF YOU COULD REALLY HEAR ME OUT AS A FRIEND... JUST AS A FRIEND, OK? [CLEARS THROAT] THANK YOU. I SAW RICHARD AND JUSTIN TONIGHT. THEY LIED, SAM. THEY KNOW EACH OTHER. REALLY? THESE KIDS BARELY HAVE PARENTS. THEY'RE LIKE ORPHANS WITH CREDIT CARDS. SCHOOL'S TOO EASY. THEY DON'T HAVE JOBS. THEY DON'T HAVE CHORES. NOTHING'S EXPECTED OF THEM. NOTHING THEY DO MATTERS... TO THEM OR ANYBODY ELSE. SO THEY FIGURED, WHY NOT KILL SOMEBODY? MAYBE THAT WILL MATTER. MAYBE I'M WRONG. MAYBE RAY DID DO IT, BUT CALL ROD AND TELL HIM YOU'RE NOT SURE AND THAT YOU WANT TO KEEP THE CASE OPEN. WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND RICHARD HAYWOOD TONIGHT? DID YOU HIT HIM... IN THE FACE? NO. NO, IT WASN--WASN'T LIKE THAT. IT-- IT WAS AN ACCI-- ROD KNOWS? HE GOT A CALL FROM RICHARD'S FATHER. HE'S GONNA MAKE YOU SEE THE DEPARTMENT SHRINK ABOUT THIS. NO. NO SHRINK. IT'S NOT GONNA WORK. I KNOW WHAT I AM. I'M JUST NOT V-- OK... SO NOBODY WANTS TO WORK WITH ME. THAT'S OK. BUT I'M A GOOD COP, AND IF WHAT I SAY IS RIGHT AND WE LET THESE KIDS GO AND THEY DO IT AGAIN... SO PLEASE, JUST TALK TO ROD. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE THAT HE'LL LISTEN TO. I'LL CALL HIM IN THE MORNING. WELL, CALL HIM NOW BECAUSE HE'S STILL UP, AND HE STAYS UP. HE STAYS AWAKE! HE'S UP LATE! JUST BACK OFF. IF ROD SAYS YES, MAYBE YOU COULD EVEN HANG AROUND THE SCHOOL AND MAKE THEM NERVOUS, YOU KNOW? [BELL RINGS] REMEMBER, WE HAVE PAPERS DUE TOMORROW. NO EXCUSES. Teacher: DON'T FORGET. YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT YOUR CONCLUSIONS. HAVING A THESIS IS NOT ENOUGH. REAL ARGUMENTS WITH QUOTATIONS WITH THE SOURCES. Boy: WHAT'S GOIN' ON, CHRIS? NOT MUCH. MR. CHECHI, I'M SAM KENNEDY, SAN BENITO POLICE. NICE TO MEET YOU. LISA. SAM KENNEDY FROM SAN BENITO POLICE. [DONG DONG DONG] START TIME. LET'S SEE... HEY, IT'S ME. I KNOW HOW THEY DID IT. NOW WE NEED TO KNOW WHY. I CAN HELP WITH THAT. I GOT SOMEONE HERE YOU OUGHT TO TALK TO. Cassie: ROD, LOOK AT THE DNA. THE VOMIT IS A PERFECT MATCH WITH JUSTIN. WHO PAID FOR THIS? Sam: CASSIE. OUT OF HER OWN POCKET. IF YOU GET A JURY WITH 12 FORENSICS EXPERTS, YOU'LL BE FINE. THAT'S WHY WE WANNA BRING THEM IN. IF WE DON'T GET A CONFESSION OUT OF AT LEAST ONE OF THESE KIDS, THEY BOTH COULD WALK. YOU THINK THEY'LL KEEP TALKING WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY PRESENT? THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA. THEY WANNA PROVE THEY'RE SMARTER THAN WE ARE. OK. SO WHERE'S THE OTHER ONE? WHO? THE HOT ONE. NOT HERE. YOU GET TO WORK WITH HER EVERY DAY? YEAH. I SHOULD BECOME A COP. SO WHAT'S UP WITH RAY? I HEAR HE'S LIKE, A... SERIAL KILLER OR SOMETHING? WELL, ACTUALLY, WE HAVE A THEORY ON THAT. IT INVOLVES YOU AND JUSTIN. IT'S JUST A THEORY. CAN I LAY IT OUT FOR YOU? YEAH. "THEREFORE, "EVERY TRULY FREE ACT IS, IN A SENSE, A CRIME, "FOR CRIME SETS ONE APART FROM THE HERD "AND FROM THE MACHINERY OF MASS SOCIETY. "BUT IT CANNOT BE A CRIME OF PROFIT OR PASSION. "IT MUST BE A GRATUITOUS, RANDOM CRIME. "CRIME AS PHILOSOPHY IS FREEDOM." INTERESTING. DO YOU BELIEVE IT? WELL, IT'S... A SCHOOL PAPER. YOU HAVE TO WRITE SOMETHING. I ENJOY TAKING INDEFENSIBLE POSITIONS AND CREATING AN ARGUMENT FOR THEM. MMM. BUT, DO YOU BELIEVE IT? SO THEN THE QUESTION IS HOW'D YOU PICK THE VICTIM? WAS IT RANDOM? I MEAN, THAT'S THE WAY I'D DO IT. Justin: THAT ONE, RIGHT THERE. THE ONE WITH THE FLOWERS. SHE'S PERFECT. NO, NO, NO, NO. SHE'S TOO SKINNY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT RANDOM MEANS? RANDOM MEANS-- I UNDERSTAND WHAT RANDOM-- DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE I'M A MORON. WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THE PLAN. IF WE DON'T FOLLOW THE PLAN-- THIS ONE. WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE WITH THE BACKPACK? DON'T GET IMPATIENT. OH HO. WAIT A SECOND. PULL UP HERE WHERE THE GIRL'S LOADING THE GROCERIES. OK. Cassie: BUT YOU LOSE THE POINT OF A PHILOSOPHICAL CRIME IF YOU FEEL GUILTY, RIGHT? H-HOW DO YOU MEAN? IF YOU KILL SOMEBODY TO PROVE YOU'RE FREE AND THEN THROW UP YOUR DINNER BECAUSE YOU'RE UPSET ABOUT WHAT YOU DID-- I DIDN'T-- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? RICHARD DIDN'T THROW UP HIS DINNER BECAUSE HE DIDN'T FEEL GUILTY. HE'S FREE, JUSTIN. YOU'RE NOT. RELAX. LET THEM WONDER WHAT WE'RE UP TO. NOW GO IN. GO IN. HEY. HEY. DON'T FORGET YOUR COFFEE. YOU CAN'T SMOKE IN HERE. COME ON. ARE WE ALMOST DONE HERE? TAKE A SEAT. SO, UM... RAY WAS AN INSPIRED CHOICE. BUT THE GREAT THING, THE REALLY GREAT THING WAS HOW SUBTLY YOU PLANTED THE FIBERS AND HAIRS AND STUFF. I GOT YOU COVERED. YOU DID RAY, RIGHT? WASN'T HE YOUR FRIEND? YOU TOLD HIM TO HIDE IN HIS TRAILER IN LOS PALOS, DIDN'T YOU? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. Cassie: YOU WENT HOME, YOU SAID HELLO TO YOUR MOTHER. IT HAD ONLY TAKEN YOU 10 MINUTES TO WALK HOME FROM THE RESTAURANT. IF SHE FEELS SHE CAN GET AWAY WITH IT, SHE'S GONNA DO IT. MOTHER, I'M HOME. YOU TOLD HER YOU WERE GOING UP TO DO SCHOOLWORK. YOU FELT CONFIDENT SHE WOULDN'T LOOK IN. AND SHE DIDN'T. SHE NEVER DID, DID SHE? [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS] Richard: I WAS WITH 6 FRIENDS. ALL NIGHT. YOU KNOW THAT. YOU TALKED TO THEM. THE NIGHT, SURE, BUT NOT THE DAY, RICHARD. THAT'S THE SECRET, ISN'T IT? YOU WEREN'T THERE AT NIGHT. Cassie: THE THING THAT ALWAYS CONFUSED ME WAS THE MUDDY FOOTPRINTS IN THE HOUSE. YOU KNOW? THE SOIL IN THE PLANTING BED WAS DRY, SO... WHERE'D THEY COME FROM? [FOOTSTEPS] SEE, I FIGURED IT WAS YOU AT THE HOUSE 'CAUSE JUSTIN WOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN TO WALK THROUGH THE WET BEDS. THAT WAS EXACTLY 3:30. HOW LONG DID YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR HER TO COME HOME? YOU DIDN'T REALLY KILL HER AT THE HOUSE. I GOTTA SAY, THAT WAS A STROKE OF GENIUS. DID--DID YOU THINK IT UP, OR WAS IT JUSTIN? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THAT HELPED US FIGURE OUT THE REAL TIMETABLE. THAT GAVE YOU PLENTY OF TIME TO GET HOME WITH THE STUDY GROUP. WELL, I'M GONNA GO GET SOME, UH... Sam: YOU TOLD THEM YOU WERE GOING TO THE ATM TO GET CASH FOR THE PIZZA. YES. AND YOU DID. AND I DID. THEN YOU HURRIED BACK. THAT TOOK 5 MINUTES. IT TOOK 5 MINUTES. NOW WE'RE TALKIN'. BUT YOU WERE GONE 15. WELL, WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT? [ROCK MUSIC PLAYS] RICHARD KILLED HER... DIDN'T HE, JUSTIN? I THINK IT WAS JUSTIN. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. AND IT'S GONNA BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU EVER HEAR, MORE IMPORTANT THAN ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE SATs AND APs. THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY KILLED OLIVIA LAKE IS GONNA BE EXECUTED, OR AT BEST GO TO JAIL FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE, AND IN YOUR CASE, THAT WOULD BE ABOUT 60 YEARS. BUT THE OTHER ONE WHO DIDN'T ACTUALLY KILL HER... IF HE COOPERATES... WILL HAVE A CHANCE AT A REAL LIFE. Cassie: RICHARD WAS BACK IN THE STUDY GROUP BY 9:25. SO YOU MUST HAVE BEEN THE ONE WHO DUMPED THE BODY. Cassie: THE PLANNING WAS EASY. NOW YOU HAD TO ACTUALLY DO IT. [CRUNCH] AND THAT IS WHY THE POSTMORTEM WOUNDS WERE SO TENTATIVE. BECAUSE YOU WERE TRYING TO BE LIKE RICHARD, BUT YOU COULDN'T. YOU WEREN'T THAT FREE. THANK GOD. GO TO HELL. MY GUY'S NOT GONNA ROLL. REALLY? MM-MM. I FIGURED HE'D BE THE ONE. NO. LET'S TALK ABOUT GOLDILOCKS FOR A MINUTE. LISA. YEAH. YOU SAID THAT SHE WENT OUT WITH RICHARD? YEAH, BRIEFLY. SHE FELT TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF, THEN SHE GOT INTERESTED IN JUSTIN. LET'S USE THAT. IT'S AN INTERESTING THEORY... BUT I CAN'T ADMIT TO SOMETHING I DIDN'T DO. WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU WON'T HAVE TO. 'CAUSE JUSTIN'S TALKING IN THERE. JUSTIN'S HERE? MM-HMM. HE TOLD US ABOUT YOU, ABOUT YOU AND LISA. OH... [LAUGHS] WHICH LISA? HA. SO YOU REALLY NEED TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. JUST THINK OF IT AS A GAME. WHOEVER TALKS FIRST IS THE WINNER. JUSTIN'S SAYING YOU BETRAYED HIM. HE TOLD US ABOUT LISA AND THE TAPE YOU MADE. JUSTIN'S TALKING. HE'S GONNA WIN THIS THING, RICHARD. UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL ME. OK, I'M GONNA GO SEE. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. COME ON, SIT DOWN. I HAVE TO ADVISE YOU OF CERTAIN RIGHTS. THE INTERVIEW IS OVER. RICHARD'S FATHER SENT HIS LAWYER. CHARGE THEM OR LET THEM GO. ANOTHER 10 MINUTES, 5, WE WOULD HAVE HAD THOSE KIDS. BOTH OF THEM. MAN, IF I EVER FIND OUT WHO LEAKED TO THE PARENTS, I SWEAR TO GOD... NO, NO. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. YEAH, UH... YEAH, I'LL TALK TO YOU TOMORROW. YOU KNOW THE ONLY THING THAT'S STOPPING HIM, JUSTIN, FROM TALKING? SAID HE NEEDS TO PROVE HE'S AS TOUGH AS HIS BUDDY. HE'S TOUGHER. YEAH, MAYBE. BUT THAT RICHARD... I'M TELLING YOU, I CANNOT WAIT TILL WE NAIL HIM. WELL, LOOK, ONE OF THEM'S THE DOER, AND HE'S GOING DOWN. BUT, I MEAN... YEAH, IT HAPPENS. IT HAPPENS. THERE'S SOMETHING... YOU GET A NARCISSISTIC PRICK LIKE RICHARD HAYWOOD WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ANYBODY BUT HIMSELF... I'M TELLING YOU, HE USES JUSTIN SOLELY TO FEED HIS EGO, PUSH HIM AROUND, HE CAN FEEL LIKE A MAN. 5 YEARS FROM NOW WHEN NO ONE EVEN CARES THAT HE WAS HOMECOMING KING OR FUNNY IN THE LUNCHROOM OR STATE POLE VAULTING CHAMP, I PITY ANYBODY WHO GETS IN HIS WAY-- ANYBODY. IS RICHARD A POLE VAULTER? NO--I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, I WAS JUST USING IT AS AN EXAMPLE OF, YOU KNOW... LOOK, UM... LOOK. I--I KNOW ABOUT CARL HUDSON. WHERE DID YOU GET THAT? THIS IS NONE OF YOUR GOD--THIS IS MY-- THIS IS MY-- MY MATTER! MINE! I KNEW THIS GIRL IN HIGH SCHOOL. SMART ENOUGH, BUT... SHE DIDN'T REALLY COME FROM ANYTHING. AND TO EVERYONE'S AMAZEMENT, THE MOST POPULAR BOY IN SCHOOL LIKED HER. STATE POLE VAULTING CHAMP. AND YOU WOULD WATCH HIM GO OVER THAT BAR IN THE SUNLIGHT... THAT GOLDEN BODY. IT WAS LIKE... LIFE JUST COULDN'T GET ANY MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THAT. AND IT DIDN'T. SHE WAS 16 WHEN SHE MARRIED HIM. 17 WHEN HE KNOCKED OUT HER UPPER BICUSPID, 18 WHEN SHE SAID SHE WAS LEAVING. HE PUT HER IN THE HOSPITAL WITH A PRETTY SERIOUS CONCUSSION. A WEEK LATER WHEN SHE GOT OUT, SHE STARTED PACKING, AND HE WAS DRUNK. POINTED HIS FINGER AT HER, HE SAID, "YOU TRY THAT AGAIN, I'LL KILL YOU." HE TOOK ANOTHER DRINK, AND SHE HEADED FOR THE DOOR. WHY DIDN'T SHE WAIT TILL HE WAS OUT, LEFT FOR WORK? 'CAUSE SHE COULDN'T. SHE HAD TO GO RIGHT THEN. WHY THEN? I--I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS BECAUSE... 'CAUSE SHE... [SIGHS] BECAUSE IT WASN'T ABOUT GETTING AWAY FROM HIM. IT WAS ABOUT STANDING UP TO HIM. EVEN IF HE KILLED HER. I GUESS SO. SO HE STABBED HER 17 TIMES WITH A KITCHEN KNIFE AND DUMPED HER BODY ON A COUNTRY ROAD. YEAH. RUINED MY FAVORITE DRESS. CARL HUDSON. 1708 01:33:27,597 --> 01:33:29,1000 CUTEST BOY I EVER SAW. UNTIL RICHARD HAYWOOD. AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TESTIFY AT CARL'S PAROLE HEARING. MM-HMM. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY? NOTHING. I'M NOT GOING. I'M NOT. YOU GOTTA GO UP THERE. YOU HAVE TO. NO. I DON'T HAVE TO. THE GIRL WITH THE DRESS, THAT WAS JESSICA MARIE HUDSON, AND I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT HER. YOU JUST INHERITED HER SCARS. LOOK, I MADE A DEAL. AND THE DEAL WAS THAT SHE DIED BACK THERE. SHE'S IN THE GROUND, AND I CAN GO ON WITH MY LIFE. EXCEPT YOU CAN'T, CAN YOU? 'CAUSE ALL YOU THINK ABOUT IS CARL HUDSON. HE'S EVERY CASE. HE'S EVERY GUY YOU DATE. YOUR WHOLE WORLD IS CARL HUDSON. IS THAT THE LIFE YOU'RE GOIN' ON WITH? DID YOU EVER GET HELP FOR ANY OF THIS? YEAH. I BECAME A COP. YOU CAN'T JUST PRETEND IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE, CASS. OH... IT HAS TO BE. BECAUSE IF IT GETS ANY MORE COMPLICATED, I CAN'T MAKE IT. Woman: RICHARD HAYWOOD IS ON LINE ONE. SWANSON. SO YOU WANNA TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS COVINGTON WOMAN, OR WHAT? YES, I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? WELL, I KNOW JUSTIN ALREADY TALKED TO YOU. I JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANNA KNOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. I THOUGHT IT WAS A GAME. HOW DO YOU PICK THE VICTIM, HOW DO YOU GET AWAY WITH IT? YOU KNOW, WE WERE BORED. I NEVER TOOK IT SERIOUSLY UNTIL I WALK INTO THE ROOM AND SHE'S LAYING THERE. DID YOU MAKE A DEAL WITH THAT BASTARD? HE SAYS HE WASN'T THERE WHEN IT WENT DOWN. AL, DID YOU MAKE A DEAL? I DON'T MAKE DEALS OVER THE PHONE, CASSIE, BUT IF WHAT THIS KID SAYS CHECKS OUT, AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN CONVICT EITHER ONE OF THEM, THEN MAYBE I WILL. FINE. THEN LET'S GET WARRANTS ON BOTH OF THEM RIGHT NOW. Woman: RICHARD, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO LEAVE WITHOUT TELLING US. IT'S A CONDITION OF-- RICHARD. WELL, WILL YOU BE BACK FOR DINNER? [SIREN] NO, JUSTIN'S NOT HERE. HIS MOTHER THOUGHT HE WAS IN HIS ROOM, BUT SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHEN HE LEFT. YEAH, SIMILAR STORY HERE. WHAT ABOUT GOLDILOCKS? LISA? YEAH, LISA. WHY DON'T YOU GET OVER THERE AND SEE WHAT SHE KNOWS. DETECTIVE, YOU MIGHT WANNA TAKE A LOOK DOWNSTAIRS. OK. GOTTA GO. BYE. I DIDN'T... I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO. WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON? THE COPS ARE ASKING ME QUESTIONS ABOUT YOU AND RICHARD, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. WE KILLED A WOMAN. [LAUGHS] NO, YOU DIDN'T. YES, WE DID. JUSTIN... HE MADE YOU DO IT. IT WASN'T JUST RICHARD. BUT HE DROVE IT. IT WAS HIS IDEA. YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BY YOURSELF. HE SEDUCED YOU. JUST LIKE HE SEDUCED ME. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO? YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM EVERYTHING. I WILL. I WILL. I DON'T HAVE ANY FEELINGS LEFT. EXCEPT FOR YOU. [CELL PHONE RINGS] IT'S HIM. DON'T ANSWER IT. Richard: WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU WITH HER? NO. YES, YOU ARE. AND YOU TOLD HER ABOUT US, DIDN'T YOU? DID YOU TELL HER EVERYTHING? WHERE ARE YOU? I LEFT HOME. ALL RIGHT? I--I-- I'M GONE. I'M NEVER GOIN' BACK. IT'S OVER. I KNOW IT'S OVER. WE HAVE TO TURN OURSELVES IN. AND GO TO PRISON? AND BE PUNKS AND EAT SHIT FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES? DO YOU EVEN REMEMBER WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT? YES. MEET ME AT THE BLUFF IN AN HOUR. OK? JUSTIN? OK. I HAVE TO MEET HIM. TO DO WHAT? I JUST HAVE TO. I WISH I MET YOU FIRST. CASSIE MAYWEATHER. HEY. HAVE A SEAT. THIS IS WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT. GLORY OR NOTHING. SHOULD WE SAY THE WORDS FOR THE LAST TIME? ONE CANNOT LIVE FULLY WITHOUT EMBRACING SUICIDE AND CRIME. SAY IT. A PACT MADE WITH RELENTLESS FIRE THAT REQUIRES THAT WHILE SOME LIVE... OTHERS DIE. ON 3. 1... 2... 3. HA HA HA HA... WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WELL, I HAVE THE BULLETS, RIGHT? WHAT ABOUT YOU? OPEN YOUR CHAMBER. JUSTIN-- OPEN IT! YOU WERE GONNA WATCH ME KILL MYSELF? THEY'RE HERE UP AT THE OLD WINTER LODGE. Sam: ROGER THAT, CASS. THAT'S UP ON HIGHLAND ROAD? SO HERE'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. SINCE I HAVE THE BULLETS AND THE GUTS TO USE THEM, I'LL SHOOT YOU, AND THEN I'LL SHOOT MYSELF, OK? NO. NO? NO, NO, NO, NO! WHY? WOULD YOU RATHER GO TO PRISON AND BE A PUNK? HMM? OR YOU THINK YOU'D BEAT PRISON 'CAUSE YOU MADE A DEAL? YOU TALKED. YOU TALKED! SHOOT ME. SHOOT ME. SHOOT ME IN THE HEAD. SHOOT ME IN THE HEART, WHATEVER YOU WANT. DO IT. IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE. PULL THE FUCKING TRIGGER. PULL IT, PULL IT, PULL IT! COME ON. JUSTIN, DON'T. BUT WE HAVE TO PAY FOR WHAT WE DID. NOT LIKE THAT. THAT'S JUST MORE KILLING. PUT THE GUN DOWN. PUT THE GUN DOWN. JUSTIN. PUT IT DOWN. JUSTIN. PLEASE DON'T. JUSTIN, JUST FOR ME. FOR ME. [DROPS GUN] COME OVER HERE NEXT TO ME. COME ON. DON'T LISTEN TO HER. DON'T LISTEN TO HER. NO, DON'T--DON'T-- NO! STAY PUT. PEOPLE ARE ON THE WAY. HEY, RICHARD. YEAH, YOU THINK YOU'RE SO SMART, HUH? JUSTIN'S SMARTER. YOU REMEMBER THAT. I GOT ONE LEFT. HA. AW, TO HELL WITH IT. [GUNSHOT] [THUDDING] OH! NO! NO! OH! AAH!

OK. I'M OK. THANK YOU. OK. I'LL GET YOU. WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO ME? WELL, GIVEN THAT YOU WEREN'T THE ACTUAL KILLER, AND WHAT YOU DID DOWN THERE FOR ME... [PANTING] DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU. YOU ALL RIGHT? MM-HMM. DO ME A FAVOR. LEAN IN AND WHISPER SOMETHING INTO MY EAR. WHAT? JUST... ANYTHING. REMEMBER WHAT I SAID ABOUT LOOKING FOR DIFFERENT PARTNERS? ARE YOU SERIOUS? WHERE WAS IT? I WANNA TAKE THAT BACK. DID THEY FIND THE VIDEOTAPE? YES. HOW'S HE DOIN'? HE LOOKS OK. BUT WE'RE GONNA TRANSPORT HIM FOR TREATMENT. WHY DID YOU LET RICHARD VIDEOTAPE THE KILLING? I MEAN, THAT WAS REALLY STUPID. IT'S LIKE YOU GUYS WANTED TO GET CAUGHT. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? OH, YOU DON'T KNOW? MY PARTNER JUST TOLD ME THAT THEY FOUND A HIDDEN CAMERA IN RICHARD'S BASEMENT. SEEMS THAT'S HOW HE FILMED HIMSELF WITH LISA, AND APPARENTLY, HE FILMED THE KILLING, TOO. D.A.'S LOOKING AT IT NOW. LOOK, WHATEVER'S ON THAT TAPE... WHATEVER'S ON THAT TAPE WHAT? IS THERE REALLY A TAPE? MAYBE I SHOULD TALK TO A LAWYER. ABSOLUTELY. TALK TO A LAWYER. WAIT A SECOND! WAIT! YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE ONE BEING MANIPULATED BY RICHARD, BUT IT WAS THE OTHER WAY AROUND, WASN'T IT? NO! DO YOU SEE THESE MARKS ON MY NECK? THEY'RE FROM RICHARD'S RING WHEN HE TRIED TO STRANGLE ME. THERE ARE NONE OF THESE MARKS ON OLIVIA'S NECK. LOOK, RICHARD, COULD HAVE TAKEN OFF THAT RING AT ANY POINT TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE RAY DID IT. THE RING HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT, JUSTIN. YOU BETTER TELL ME RIGHT NOW WHAT HAPPENED... I AM! AND I'LL DO MY BEST TO GET YOU TRIED AS A JUVENILE. YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME. WHEN I WENT OVER THERE, I HAD NO IDEA. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D... [MUFFLED PLEAS] OH, GOD. [WOMAN STRUGGLING] ARE YOU GONNA DO IT OR WHAT? I--I CAN'T. FUCK! [WOMAN SOBBING] SO, WHAT, I HAVE TO DO IT? YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING. YOU HAVE IDEAS. THAT'S IT! YOU'RE SO FULL OF SHIT, TOO. YOU'RE ALWAYS TELLING ME THAT... CRIME'S NOT AN IDEA, RICHARD, IT'S AN ACT. ANYBODY CAN THINK IT. ONLY FREE MEN CAN DO IT. I'M FREE. [MUFFLED PLEADING] GIVE ME THE GLOVES. GIVE THEM TO ME. THANK YOU. [MUFFLED PLEAS] I HAD TO SHOW HIM. I COULD HAVE LET YOU DIE UP THERE, BUT I DIDN'T. I DIDN'T DO THAT. THANK YOU. PLEASE, I JUST WANT A CHANCE. I WANT TO START OVER. I WANT TO START-- DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY, JUSTIN. YOU GET ONE LIFE. AND WHATEVER YOU DO WITH IT AND WHATEVER'S DONE TO YOU, YOU GOTTA FACE THAT. YOU CAN'T PRETEND IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. Clerk: JESSICA MARIE HUDSON? JESSICA MARIE HUDSON...
