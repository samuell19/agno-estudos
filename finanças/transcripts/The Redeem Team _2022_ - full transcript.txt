- [KOBE] What's up? How you feeling? - [LEBRON] Chillin'. What's going on? [MAN 1] Bron, you're on that side of the couch. - [MAN 2] Bron right here. - [LEBRON] Okay. - [MAN 1] Yeah. - Bron right here, Kobe on that corner. [INTERVIEWER] All right, Kobe. So you won the gold. Where would this stack up? [KOBE] Well, it's a higher priority. You're representing your country, and you're competing against basketball players who are the best in their country. To me, that holds a greater significance. [INTERVIEWER] When did it sink in this is something much bigger than yourself? You know, it's, uh... to me, it's just walking around every day. Just, you know, whether I'm going to the grocery store or going to pick up coffee or whatever it is, people just coming on the street and just saying, "Bring back the gold." You see a guy with a Celtics jersey at Disneyland, I'm ready to kill him. 'Cause he's wearing a Garnett jersey, you know, I'm pissed. I'm thinking he going to say something smart about the Finals. "Bring back the gold for us." Enough said. Enough said. Bring back the gold. [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [FIREWORKS WHISTLING] [SPORTSCASTER] Welcome to Beijing, the Opening Ceremony of the 2008 Summer Games. [INTENSE MUSIC CONTINUES] The moment has arrived. [PERFORMERS CHEERING] [SPORTSCASTER] And the focus of China and the world is on the National Stadium. [ALL BANGING IN UNISON] If you follow basketball, then you know the nickname of this year's squad. The Redeem Team. [SPORTSCASTER] They've been dubbed the Redeem Team. [REPORTER] The Redeem Team. The Redeem Team, because of the past failures internationally. [ALL SHOUTING] [REPORTER 2] There's a new era in Olympic basketball, and it's one in which the United States is no longer dominant. [COACH] The money and the greed of the NBA, is that having an effect upon our competitive nature? Yeah. You could write that. We'd lost respect internationally. We had lost respect for ourselves. [REPORTER 3] Melo, what happened out there? I don't know. I wasn't out there. There was a snowball effect of just negativity. [JOURNALIST] Into this mess, they all brought their own individual stories. [JOURNALIST 2] Kobe was keeping to himself. He never seemed to find any common ground. [LEBRON] I felt like I was the best basketball player in the world, but I still hadn't proven enough. [REPORTER 4] There's a ghost haunting every play. The ghost of defeat. There was a hunger about that '08 team. There was a hunger. [DWYANE] We had a lot of things that we needed to show the world. And it wasn't just basketball. [INTENSE MUSIC FADES] [FLASHBULB CLICKS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [MAN] Get out there, Mike! [MAN 2] Okay! [GRUNTS] This is the most important thing that we will ever do as coaches. The thing that I've learned over the last two years is what great heart and courage all of you guys have. This team has been put together to win internationally. We have the three best point guards in the world. You have Dwyane, Carmelo, LeBron, and Kobe. This team has 12 guys who can fucking win an Olympic championship, and you don't know which one of you is gonna be called upon at a moment to play a significant role in a huge win. [PLAYERS SHOUTING, GRUNTING] [MAN] I got you outside! [JOURNALIST] A lot of them were not known as great team players. Kobe was individual. LeBron still hadn't proven himself to anybody as being any kind of a leader. All run by a coach who was from the army. And it was the challenge of their lives. [CLAPPING] Way to run the floor, boy! How are we gonna win? What are we gonna win? What are we gonna establish? Is it just to qualify for the fucking Olympics? If that's the only reason we're here, that's too shallow. [CARMELO] Mind you, from '04 to that point, we was losing. Team USA Basketball was at the bottom. [COACH] When you're on the US team, you're supposed to win all the time. You're supposed to be perfect. These guys were not. ["MAKE THE ROAD BY WALKING" BY MENAHAN STREET BAND PLAYING] [SPORTSCASTER] The scoreboard tells the story in a nutshell. USA 89, Russia 55. And America holds the world championship of basketball. [CROWD CHEERING] [ANNOUNCER] Gold medalists, the United States of America. [ANNOUNCER 2] The United States of America. [ANNOUNCER 3] The United States capture another championship without loss of a game. [JOURNALIST] Basketball at the Olympics, the gold medal was America's to lose. It was news if it was even a close game. [JOURNALIST 2] US basketball always was so dominant, and we had the big stars of the game. But, you know, also we came to the notion, "Just because we're Americans, we're better." You know, if you were from Europe or South America, well, you couldn't be as good 'cause you weren't American. And that wasn't true. They had the same ability to... to gain expertise in basketball that we did. [INTRIGUING MUSIC PLAYING] [SPORTSCASTER] Welcome to the semifinals. It's the United States and the Soviet Union. The drama beginning to build. [SPORTSCASTER 2] We're underway! Last time they played was 16 years ago in Munich. The only time the American team has ever lost an Olympic basketball game. People in the USA, sports fans, we took it for granted. "When it comes to the Olympics, it's our game." "We invented it. We're gonna win. It doesn't matter who shows up." That's what we thought. [SPORTSCASTER 2] Coles... tough defense. Sabonis rips down another... It's a two-on-one break. Marčiulionis... And that should do it for the Soviets. [CROWD CHEERING] The United States goes home stunned. [REPORTER] How big a win was it? US came into this game with an 84 and 1 Olympic record overall, having won nine of ten gold medals. Bottom line may have been the Soviet experience, which, uh, may accelerate the push in the United States to allow NBA pros to compete in the Olympics. [SMITH] American USA Basketball starts to panic and says, "You know, we got to put together something that represents American basketball." And so who shows up in 1992? ["HIGHER BABY" BY DJ JAZZY JEFF AND FRESH PRINCE PLAYING] [ANNOUNCER] Ladies and gentlemen, the US Olympic Dream Team. ♪ Boom in your face Now take that ♪ ♪ Get on track Or you best step back... ♪ [SPORTSCASTER] This group may well be the greatest team ever assembled in the history of team sports. [CROWD CHEERING] You know, when your opposition is asking for autographs before the game, you've got a little bit of an edge on them. They did the best they could, but they were totally overwhelmed. [CROWD CHEERING] [COLANGELO] It brought back a little bit of glory for the USA. ♪ O say, does that star-spangled banner... ♪ But, you know, the Dream Team wasn't about patriotism. [SOLEMN MUSIC PLAYING] It wasn't doing it for America. It's really, "Do it for the NBA." [CROWD CHEERING, WHISTLING] [REPORTER] This, of course, is the Dream Team, whose declared purpose is to win back US basketball honor. But it's here for another purpose as well. It's taking care of business. We think we have a great American product, and we would like to market it on a global basis with as much, uh, class and success as we possibly can. [SOLEMN MUSIC CONTINUES] [REPORTER 2] This team of All-Stars is almost too good. Some think we should go back to the collegiates. It's been too easy. I think then we ought to ban the African runners from the 10,000 meters, because they make it look so easy as well. - [REPORTER 2 LAUGHS] - This is about our best. This is wonderful for the sport of basketball. [SOLEMN MUSIC FADES] With the ninth pick in the 1998 NBA Draft, the Milwaukee Bucks select Dirk Nowitzki from Würzburg, Germany. The San Antonio Spurs select Emanuel Ginóbili from Argentina. The Atlanta Hawks select Pau Gasol from FC Barcelona, Spain. [CROWD CHEERING] [COACH] Basketball took off to another level after that worldwide. The international game was improving by leaps and bounds. It was a jolt. This next wave that comes along, inspired by the Dream Team, they were more competitive, and they were a greater threat to USA Basketball. '92, it was introduced as a global game, but the game was starting to catch up to us. We talk about these different countries, they have talented basketball players who have been taught the fundamentals. - [GRUNTING] - [CROWD CHEERING] Now, the world is not afraid. The scare factor was gone. [CROWD CHEERING] [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] [GEORGE W. BUSH] My fellow citizens, at this hour, American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq, to free its people, and to defend the world from grave danger. And now to the upcoming Olympic Games in Greece, where fear of terrorism has left the lineup for America's men's basketball team up in the air. Big-name NBA stars routinely lend their talent to take home the gold, but this time, some are saying no. [REPORTER] When it comes to excuses, coach Larry Brown has heard them all. Jason Kidd has a sore knee. Shaquille O'Neal says he's waiting to see how far the Lakers advance in the playoffs. [ADANDE] If you look at the environment hovering over the 2004 Olympics, that was the first Summer Games after 9/11, and with the invasion of Iraq, now there's this sense that America is acting unilaterally and is starting to become an unwelcome guest around the world. So there were legitimate safety and security concerns. And all these players who had already participated in '96 and 2000 didn't feel the need to go back and do that again. I remember watching it via TV, and you just see some of the players not wanna go. It just became this epidemic. The NBA put a lot of pressure on in terms of adding some future stars. Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony, and LeBron James. [LEBRON] I didn't think I earned an opportunity to be on that team. You know, literally, this is the summer right after my rookie year, and all I'm thinking about is hanging out with my friends, hanging out with my family, and training. [DWYANE] I just finished my rookie season, and I'm in summertime in Chicago, hanging with my family, and I get a call asking me to be a part of the Olympic team, and I'm like... "What?" [CHUCKLES] ["TITLES" BY JON BRION PLAYING] [CARMELO] Nine guys drop out. So they had to fill those spots, and we got the call, like, "Would y'all want to be a part of this USA Team?" I'm like, "Hell, yeah." Like, "C'mon, let's do it." ["TITLES" CONTINUES] [DWYANE] "Oh my God, they asked me to be a part of something that I remember being so incredible with the Dream Team." "Sign me up." But mind you, we got the call saying, "If y'all want to play, y'all gotta meet us in Jacksonville in two weeks." We didn't know what to expect. Everybody had backed out. This was going to be our moment to go over there and get, you know, a gold medal. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] I remember going to Jacksonville, seeing the US team. It was separated. It was like two different teams. Like, you had AI and Marbury, Tim Duncan. And then you had the younger guys, the rookies who was just... who was coming into the league. [LEBRON] You look at all the younger crew, you know, myself and Melo, D Wade, you know, we just trying to figure out, like, how do we fit into this? We're young. We up and down, dunks, lobs, this and that. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [EXCLAIMS] It was a disconnect between both groups. It was like, "Oh, we have this young group of guys that's coming on board." Then you had the older guys, just like, "This is our shit. We gotta make this work." And then you just had Larry Brown. We've played a certain way for the last five or six years. All right? We gotta... we gotta change right now. We had a group of guys that... I think Coach was trying to prove a point with the Olympics, that he could get all of us to play "the right way," which was "his way." We're ready to take the roll. You go screen... This has become a world sport. We better respect the people we play, or we're gonna be in trouble. [REPORTER] Do you have a sense that people are saying, "Well, this might be the team that can't win the gold"? We got a lot of doubters out there for the simple fact we're a young team. I don't think a lot of people think that young players could do it. So we gotta prove ourselves. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] The Olympic Games are here in Greece, which one local official described as "a convenient intersection in a bad neighborhood." [NEWSCASTER] The players and their families will stay on a cruise ship off the Greek coast while being protected by Greek and American authorities during the Games. [CARLOS] We're not in the Olympic Village. We're not by the Olympians. It didn't really feel like we're a part of the Olympic experience. [SPORTSCASTER] It starts with Puerto Rico. Will the United States men win another gold medal? Will they suffer a loss for the first time in Olympic play since NBA players were allowed to compete? Those questions will be answered with this game. [DWYANE] If you look at the names on the team, you're like, "We g... we good. Let's go do this." [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [ANNOUNCER] Iverson to Marion! [WHISTLE BLOWING] Not only America thought we're gonna win, we weren't paying attention, we thought we're gonna win so much. [ANNOUNCER] ...pick-and-roll, Puerto Rico. Nice feed inside! And Puerto Rico opens up a nine-point lead. Most of the reporters were at other venues. We were covering skeet shooting and track and field and swimming. Nobody was even paying attention. [ANNOUNCER] Carmelo Anthony. Beautiful save by Ayuso. Carlos Arroyo... Oh, what a ball fake! [MAN] I remember the game against Puerto Rico. I remember Mike Breen and I, we were doing the game. And we looked at each other, and we go, "Uh-oh, this team is in trouble." [ANNOUNCER] Arroyo draws the foul. And one! We didn't take Puerto Rico with the respect they deserved, and they, uh... they kicked our ass. [ANNOUNCER] It's finally happened. The United States loses in Olympic play with NBA players. But that first game against Puerto Rico really let us know, like, "Damn, like, okay, we... we fucking around." "We... we gotta get our shit together." Lots of people are talking about the American men's basketball team. It was, by any stretch of the imagination, a complete upset and an embarrassment. They were called the "Dream Team," but now some people are calling them the "Cream Team." The younger guys, we were pissed at Larry Brown, because he didn't play us. [REPORTER] Melo, what happened out there, you think? I don't know. I wasn't out there. I don't think... They scored more points than us. That's all I can say. We thought, "We should be playing because we could help this team win." But Larry Brown didn't... He didn't think that we could as much as the veteran guys. - [MAN] They can still win. - They can still win. - That's what I was looking for. - It's a round-robin event. - It's conceivable they could win gold. - Right. [SPORTSCASTER] We're going to bring you live coverage of the United States and Argentina. The spot in tomorrow's gold medal game on the line. You can tell immediately that they had this chemistry. [ANNOUNCER] Argentina has such open looks. They pass the ball so well. [ANNOUNCER 2] There's Sánchez spotting up and shooting the three. They was more cohesive. They was more running plays. They was running sets. [ANNOUNCER] Ginóbili, wide-open three. [CROWD CHEERING] You could tell they had spent real time, like years and years playing with each other. [ANNOUNCER 2] Count it, and a foul! They could pass the ball right here and know that the guy is cutting. [ANNOUNCER] Ginóbili. Sánchez threads the needle to Oberto. They just had the chemistry. They had the teamwork. They had the camaraderie. They had everything out on the floor. I mean, they just... they played the game how the game's supposed to be played. [ANNOUNCER] Sconochini, fancy to Montecchia. Oh, what a fancy play. There'll be no gold in Athens. And there's the exclamation point. The United States men fail to win it all at the Olympic Games. It was ugly to watch. It was terrible to watch and terrible to be a part of. [ANNOUNCER] They might be starting to say there's a new era in Olympic basketball, and it's one in which the United States is no longer dominant. They're great players. They're the best team. In terms of individual players, they're the best. But this is a team sport. So you play five-on-five. You don't play one-on-one. It's not tennis. [CARMELO] We was just a whole bunch of... kind of just bullshit thrown together and said, "Go out there and... and... and win us a gold medal." There was no culture with Team USA. There was no culture at all. [ANNOUNCER] The United States set to receive their bronze medals. You can see from their body language, they're disappointed. Well, I'm watching it here in Durham, North Carolina, and, uh... agonizing. [ANNOUNCER 2] And you see the joy in Argentina. [CROWD CHEERING] [KRZYZEWSKI] The other countries don't take anything for granted. They have a national team. Argentina, those guys were together since they were 18 years old. They're brothers. [CROWD CHEERING, WHISTLING] [LEBRON] There wasn't a lot of time. We had to figure out how to become a team in two weeks. I was young, but I understood what it meant to build chemistry in order to win. [KRZYZEWSKI] We had it with the Dream Team, and then there was no continuity after that. ["ARGENTINE NATIONAL ANTHEM" PLAYING] [CROWD WHISTLING] [CROWD CHEERING] [CARMELO] Coming back home and the disrespect that we were getting from our own country. There were songs about us. Everybody was talking about us. ["WHY (REMIX)" BY JADAKISS PLAYING] ♪ Why Team USA keep gettin' blown out? ♪ You know, "These players suck," and, "The rest of the world's caught up." "How do you lose to Puerto Rico?" Finally, these men, A, are on line to buy tickets, B, have traveled far to see the games, C, just defeated the United States Men's Basketball Team. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] It was just a snowball effect of... of just negativity. [ANNOUNCER] The United States men settle for the bronze. I'm sitting up on the podium, you know, receiving the bronze like, "This shit was a waste of my time." At that moment, I definitely wasn't playing for Team USA again. Still stinging from their bronze-medal showing in Athens last summer, USA Basketball has revamped itself and has turned over power to Jerry Colangelo. [SPORTSCASTER] Almost everything Jerry Colangelo touches works. Particularly start-up projects. He was involved with a start-up project that became the Chicago Bulls in 1966. He then went out west to Arizona, and he started up three out of the four teams out there. [COLANGELO] Back in early 2004, my net worth was really wrapped up in the Phoenix Suns. So I decided to sell the team. I knew it was gonna leave some kind of a void. And I said, "You know, what's next?" It was just a couple of weeks later when I got that call about USA Basketball. You know, I basically said, "I... I'll do it. I'll do it." "But no more committees." "I'll pick the coaches. I'll pick the players." Colangelo will pick them without a committee. - You don't think that's too much power? - [SPORTSCASTER] Probably. - This guy gets it done. - You trust him? I do. I do trust him. I had some names up on a board of... of coaches. Let's talk about coaches. Dean Smith, from North Carolina, obviously, said, "There's only one coach who could get the job done, who has the respect of all the players." "He stands alone. He's the only one." It was Coach K at Duke. [ANNOUNCER] The Duke of Destiny has won it! For the first time in two decades, college basketball has a repeat champion. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [CARLOS] It's like the Yankees. Either you love 'em or you hate 'em. That's how Duke was because of the success. Growing up in the inner city, you hate Duke. You just hate Duke. You hate Christian Laettner. You hate JJ Redick. You hate Coach K. You hate the damn Blue Devil. There was no, like... excitement when Coach K was, uh, appointed that position with Team USA. [CARMELO] When they announced that he was coming on, our first thought was, like, "Yo, how is he going to handle all these players that's on this team as a college coach?" I had a lot of concerns. One is just the credibility that I would have with the NBA players. Obviously, I had achieved a lot in the collegiate ranks, but NBA's different. The thing that changed right away was that you weren't gonna be the Olympic coach. You were gonna be the national coach. That was a step of trying to have one coach have a four-year period where they were running a program. You have to put a team together. It can't be fantasy basketball. It can be All-Stars, but they have to fit roles. [LEBRON] Coach K and Jerry, they stressed that from the beginning. It needed to be a commitment where you really took it serious and not just some old one-off. If you want to be a part of this, you have to commit, you know, three summers, right away. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] - What's up? - What's up, man? Guys seem in a good mood. - What's up? What's going on? - Is that what you want? [KRZYZEWSKI] Good seeing you. [CARLOS] Our whole team met in Vegas for a training camp, and in the very first meeting, Coach K says, "This is not our game." "This is the world's game." [CARMELO] I remember he was mad. He was livid about that. Like, we got to respect everybody in the rest of the world. From day one, he established himself as that guy. Like, "Listen, I'm not here to tell you guys what to do." "You guys are professionals, but this is a working relationship." "I want y'all to talk to me. I want to be open. I want to be honest." [KRZYZEWSKI] What you have to understand, in order to win a fight, you have to know who you're fighting. You're fighting somebody who thinks that they're Superman. They have nothing to lose. From the get-go, the pressure was on. We lost last time. We're supposed to be the best in the world. So with the national team concept, if you're not coming in and taking it seriously, you won't last. [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] After we lost '04, we all felt like we were letting USA Basketball down, especially us four guys. You know, myself, D Wade, Bron, and Melo, we were a part of that team, and we felt that agony of defeat. [DWYANE] I think early on, it was looked at as, "International players are soft, right?" "American players are tough." Once you start looking at it, you're like, "No, they're not soft." "They're skilled. They play the game a different way." We have to learn their game and quit making excuses and quit trying to impose our game on theirs. If we learn their game, we will beat them. You all and I don't know everything. We especially don't know what each other knows. That's what practice is about, is all getting on the same page. [LEBRON] The first thing that surprised me about Coach K was that he didn't give a fuck about nobody's résumé, but he always did it with respect. I've always gotten the best out of myself playing for someone that holds everybody accountable. - Coming left! Coming left! - [PLAYER] Get up there! Yep! Yep! This is the way we play on the US team. No matter who is playing on it, who's coaching it or whatever. This is the way the United States team should play. Good, good. He was the one who told us, "Hey, I don't want y'all to not come in here with y'all egos and y'all pride. That's who make y'all who y'all are." You have to give me the egos that you have in your current basketball teams. Bring 'em to this team. Okay? And put it under one ego umbrella. [DWYANE] I remember sitting there watching and hearing him say that. I was like, "That makes sense." Get up, Brad. Get up, Brad. Uh-huh. Right there. [KRZYZEWSKI] The thing I'm most surprised about is how well you talk to one another. You guys are interacting well in between drills. There's a really good spirit that needs to be developed. You got it. Just keep developing. Two times! [PLAYERS EXCLAIMING] [CHRIS PAUL] Trials was crazy. We stayed at the Wynn in Vegas for like a month. We lived in Vegas for like a month. That's when a lot of the relationships that you see were sort of forged. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] I got no say on the bus! Get on the bus! [MAN] Grab the bags, man! [CHRIS PAUL] I can't get on. I can't get on! There was a group of us that played cards every single night for 35 straight days. You know, 35 days, you're gone from your family, but you're able to, um... you know, it's another family. It's like another part of your family. It's like I never left home. - You feel me? - I'm the best-looking one of the crew. So you know, it... it's... you know, they like my bodyguards, you know what I'm saying? [LAUGHS] [CARMELO] No. No. [LAUGHS] I would rather you say, "I got a ring," than just say what you just said. [ALL LAUGHING] Know what I'm saying? [KRZYZEWSKI] Listen, for all you guys, and it's important. I really want you to pay close attention. This morning, we have people who represent us, and... people don't get a chance to look up to 'em. You don't even know what... what they... what they do. [CARMELO] Coach K is a motivator, and that's what he did. Each day, we had a different person come in there, talk to us. [KRZYZEWSKI] There's no more important thing we're gonna do today than listen to what these heroes have to say to us. [MAN] Coach K being a West Point grad, he loves his country. He loves serving his country. So much of what he talked about, there were always so many parallels to his time in the military. So that ran deep with him. Let's face it. It's what makes teams great, is selfless service. It's putting the needs of someone else before yourself. On the basketball court, that may be diving for the loose ball or taking a charge. On the battlefield, it may be running into a... a... a wall of bullets. Putting your life on the line for someone else, and... and that... to that level of selfless service. [CARLOS] When you're a great player, you think you can do it by yourself. I can win by myself. I can score enough points. Whatever. With Coach K, what he wants to do is, you can do it, but you can achieve more with a group than you can individually. It's a military mindset. [BROWN] An explosion went off, and a piece of shrapnel came and hit him in the eyes. It looks like, uh, his eyes are normal. He does not have any eyes. They were taken out by that shrapnel that went through his head. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] And he's still serving. That's a hero. It definitely hit me in my emotions. They showed us who and what we were playing for. These are the flags we wore on our uniforms in Iraq, and, uh, we got a flag for each one of you. I'm hoping they can put it on your warm-up jerseys. And what I'm hoping is that you'll look down, you'll see that flag, and you'll realize thousands of people have gone before you and sacrificed so you can be a great basketball player. [SOMBER MUSIC CONTINUES] [DWYANE] Scotty, you hear me? [CARMELO] We would be mic'd up. We would say little things to him in the mic and talk to him from the court. Blue is getting into us right now. So White Team, we gotta pick it up as a team. They're playing better than us. [PLAYERS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [DWYANE] Y'all put y'all uniforms on. I know y'all got a lot of pride. We put these jerseys on, we feel a lot of pride walking around with USA on our chest. So, I know y'all got a lot of pride. You guys are role models to a lot of us out here. We don't get a chance to tell y'all. Y'all are role models to us. We respect what y'all do for our country. [KRZYZEWSKI] Hearing those stories, our players let their hearts be opened. And as a result, they became the US. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [SPORTSCASTER] And welcome to a special edition of the FIBA World Championship. The United States will take its first step this morning in trying to reclaim the top spot in the basketball world. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] FIBA Worlds in '06 was the first time we went as a team with Coach K, and what put even more pressure on is that we needed to qualify for Beijing. And we needed to win the tournament. [KRZYZEWSKI] Every game we play, we have to play it like it's a sprint, not a marathon. These games are gonna go real fast. Let's not pick up any bad habits, especially the habit of overlooking anybody. [CROWD CHEERING] [ANNOUNCER] Big thing for the United States is you know there are gonna be jitters because all these guys feel the pressure of representing this team and getting that gold medal. [LEBRON] It ain't about an individual. It ain't about us. It ain't about us playing for our teams. It's about the United States of America. Let's do it for everybody in the United States of America. "USA" on three. One, two, three! - [ALL] USA! - Let's go! [DWYANE] We were very good. You could tell, like, okay, we getting the swagger back. [ANNOUNCER 2] They make it look so easy. When they're hot, they're really hot. [DWYANE] Every game, we did our job. We came out, and we put teams away. And we were playing very well. [ANNOUNCER 3] Anthony. Boy, how good has he been? [ANNOUNCER 2] United States are still on track to march to the finals. [ANNOUNCER 3] But trust me, Jim, the competition will get tougher. [ANNOUNCER 2] Well, after 72 dates of competition, it all comes down to the number one seeds in each of the pools. And we've got number one United States going against number one Greece. [KRZYZEWSKI] Don't be sloppy, okay? And, uh, like you guys have done the whole time, let's be classy and... and go after it. ["TEHRAN" BY HEEN PLAYING] [ANNOUNCER] Greece are the European Champions. That's how good these guys are that the USA are playing. You know, I remember that game like it was yesterday. They had a guy, "Baby Shaq." [ANNOUNCER] And Baby Shaq, Schortsanitis, he is a huge human being. [ANNOUNCER 2] Up ahead to big man Schortsanitis for the dunk! And just like that, it's 36-35! For one quarter, the third quarter, we were horrible, and they were great. [ANNOUNCER] The problem for the US team is they haven't defended the pick-and-roll. - What a lovely pass! - [ANNOUNCER 2] What a pass! [ANNOUNCER] Oh my goodness me, that's how it's done. They're being picked to bits. [DWYANE] They beat us with our own offense. The NBA, at that point, is now a high pick-and-roll league. They beat us with high pick-and-roll. [ANNOUNCER] Diamantidis, a pass back inside to go to the hoop... It might look on the TV like, "Why don't they just stop 'em?" When you're playing in real time, it's hard to figure out what the hell is going on. And they confidence kept going. They was making shots. They played the perfect game, and we never got back. [ANNOUNCER] He misses. That's it. It's Greece! They have defeated the United States! The United States have crashed and burned once again by the semifinal match. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] [KRZYZEWSKI] When we lost in 2006 in Japan, I've never had a defeat worse than that. [CROWD CHEERING] I mean, you're coaching your country's team, and you lose. [CARMELO] I remember everybody's in the locker room already after the loss, and I'm just on the court, and we looking at the celebration. And it was just like... [CLICKS TONGUE] ..."We can never have this feeling ever again." [DWYANE] We did not want to go up and get on that stand and take those bronze medals, 'cause we was like, "We are better than this." It wasn't time. You can't think that things are gonna happen on your term. I know I didn't feel as shitty as I did when we lost in Athens, but it wasn't the right time. [PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYING] On behalf of USA Basketball, I just want to welcome you back. Last summer, we fell short of something we wanted to do, and that was win the World Championships so that we wouldn't have to qualify this summer. And it didn't happen. [KRZYZEWSKI] We lost in '06 because we thought we knew the landscape, and we didn't. We were gonna now learn the game we were playing instead of the game that we played in the NBA. I just want to tell you some... some things that we're gonna do. It wasn't natural. That game was not natural for our play... It's a different ball. It has 12 panels instead of 8. You can walk through the free-throw line when someone's shooting. You can touch the ball off the rim in the Olympics. It's, like, all these small rule things that we weren't used to. If you're down here bumping without the ball or cutting like they said this morning, if you're cutting down from the high post down to the low post, he can get in my way, and there's no foul. In the NBA, we can't do that anymore. [KRZYZEWSKI] We had to get a feel for the game, a feel for the ball, a feel for the officials. We had to learn a different game. And we knew we needed some older players. That's why we went out and recruited Kobe Bryant. - [MAN] What's up, man? - How you doing? [MAN] Good to see you. Welcome. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [PLASCHKE] Nobody brought more baggage to Team USA than Kobe Bryant. He had been ostracized by the league. He came into this at a point of his career where it could have gone either way. He had run Shaquille O'Neal, a beloved figure, out of LA. They thought he snitched out Shaq's personal life to the police. [CROWD CHEERING] They thought he was selfish. [KOBE] We gotta do something this summer and get a contender. I don't want to be a one-man show. He had demanded a trade in the parking lot of a Ralphs grocery store in Newport Beach. Kobe Bryant today turning the NBA world on its head. - Are you saying you want to be traded? - [KOBE] Yeah, I would like to be traded. Says he wants out, says he recants it and wants back. [ADANDE] 2007 is an interesting point in his career. He's taken a hit. And so Kobe is fighting to regain his place. He's fighting to restore his name as well. [PLASCHKE] He had to prove that he was a team player. He had to prove that he was a good guy. He had to prove himself to everybody in the world. We knew right away how serious it was. And he always had a very serious demeanor. You don't meet Kobe, and he's like, "Hey, man! I'm Kobe!" That's not the experience you have. It's more like, "This is Kobe Bryant." "Nice to meet you." I'm like, "Damn," you know? [LAUGHING] [LEBRON] We was kind of surprised that he wanted to be a part of Team USA after everything that had went on. I'm not one to force a relationship with anyone, but you sense Kobe is someone who don't really want to be fucked with. [PLASCHKE] Kobe did an interview, and he talked about talking with a couple of his NBA friends. And the reporters, we laughed. 'Cause we knew he didn't have any friends. ["TOP SHELF" BY OUTERSPACE FEAT. SADAT X PLAYING] [ADANDE] Kobe had never taken the steps to ingratiate himself with the players around the league, so they're still eyeing him a little warily. [CHRIS BOSH] I knew Kobe, but I didn't know him. Played basketball against him. [ANNOUNCER] Kobe again! Yessir! He's the best player ever. And he was... he was almost untouchable. ♪ Get up, throw your hands in the air ♪ ♪ Or shut up... ♪ [CARMELO] Man, Kob is a guy
