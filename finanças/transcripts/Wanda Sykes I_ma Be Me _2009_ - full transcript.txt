EVERY TIME YOU SEE HIM WALKING TO THAT HELICOPTER, I LOVE SEEING HIM TAKE THAT STROLL ACROSS THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN, BOY. IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL. YOU JUST SEE HIM, HE'S JUST WALKING ACROSS THE LAWN. HE DIDN'T DO THAT SHIT DURING THE CAMPAIGN, DID HE? NAW, HE WAS STIFF AS A MOTHERFUCKER DURING THE CAMPAIGN. IT'S LIKE HE WAS COUNTING THAT SHIT OUT IN HIS HEAD. HE'S LIKE, "OKAY, ONE, TWO, WAVE, SMILE. ONE, TWO, WAVE, SMILE. WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT TOUCH YOUR PENIS, DO NOT-- TOUCH YOUR DICK, IT'S ALL OVER. DO NOT TOUCH YOUR DICK. STOP LOOKING AT MICHELLE'S ASS. OH, GEEZ. OKAY, REMEMBER-- YOU DON'T HAVE A DICK. DON'T-- DON'T TOUCH YOUR DICK." FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT-- I'M SO HAPPY 'CAUSE NOW I CAN RELAX A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW, I CAN LOOSEN UP. DON'T HAVE TO BE SO BLACK ALL THE TIME. DON'T HAVE TO BE SO DIGNIFIED, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE WE DID IT. BLACK FOLKS, WE ALWAYS GOTTA BE DIGNIFIED. YEAH, 'CAUSE WE KNOW IF WE FUCK UP, WE JUST SET EVERYBODY ELSE BACK A COUPLE OF YEARS, RIGHT? WELL, WE SHOULD HAVE KILLED FLAVOR FLAVE LIKE 10 YEARS GO. WE WOULD OF... HE HAS BEEN HOLDING US BACK. BUT WE DID IT. NOW I CAN RELAX A LITTLE BIT. I CAN DO SOME SHIT. I CAN-- I CAN-- I CAN DANCE ON CAMERA. I COULDN'T DANCE ON CAMERA BEFORE. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, MY MOTHER, SHE WOULDN'T EVEN LET US DANCE IN THE CAR. YOU KNOW, WE SITTING IN THE CAR, A GOOD SONG WOULD COME ON THE RADIO, WE-- ( humming ) MY MOTHER WAS LIKE-- SHE WOULD STOP THE CAR. "UH, DO YOU WANNA DANCE OR DO YOU WANT A RIDE? 'CAUSE YOU AIN'T DANCIN' IN MY CAR. WHITE PEOPLE ARE LOOKIN' AT YOU!" I'M GOING, "HUH?" "WHITE PEOPLE ARE LOOKIN' AT YOU!" I'M LIKE... "OH DAMN!" SHE WAS RIGHT. WELL, I HAD THAT SHIT IN MY HEAD-- COULDN'T DO THAT, COULDN'T DANCE. COULDN'T DANCE. BUT NOW, SHIT, I COULD DANCE. WE GOT A BLACK PRESIDENT. NOT ONLY CAN I DANCE, I CAN TAP DANCE! YOU KNOW WHAT DIGNIFIED BLACK PEOPLE HATE? TAP DANCERS. HATE THAT SHIT. IT'S LIKE LOOK AT THAT DANG BOJANGLES JUST SETTING US BACK. HOW WE GONNA GET AHEAD, SHE UP THERE LOOKING LIKE BOJANGLES? NOW I COULD DANCE. I COULD DO SOME OTHER SHIT. I CAN BUY WHOLE WATERMELONS NOW. I NO LONGER HAVE TO GROW 'EM IN MY CLOSET UNDER MY WEED LAMP. BEFORE, I WOULD GO IN THE GROCERY STORE AND I WOULD LOOK AT THE WHOLE WATERMELONS. I WAS LIKE, "DAMN, THEY LOOK GOOD! BOY, I WOULD LIKE TO GET A WHOLE WATERMELON. I WOULD GET ALL THESE WHITE PEOPLE LOOKIN' AT ME. "FUCK YOU, WHITIE! I AIN'T BUYIN' A WHOLE WATERMELON FOR YOUR ENJOYMENT! I'M GONNA GO OVER HERE TO THE SALAD BAR. TAKE MY DIGNIFIED ASS TO THE SALAD BAR, GET THE SLICED WATERMELON. LET ME CAMOUFLAGE THIS SHIT WITH SOME CANTALOUPE. GOOD DAY, SIR." NOW I GOT A BLACK PRESIDENT. YOU SHOULD SEE ME. I'M WALKING OUT THE GROCERY STORE WITH THE WATERMELON ON MY SHOULDER. "YEAH! OBAMA, BITCH!" SHIT. I HOPE HE GETS A SECOND TERM, THEN I'M GOING TO POPEYES. ( audience laughing, cheering ) YOU'LL SEE ME IN THE POPEYES DRIVE-THROUGH DANCIN' AND EATING WATERMELON. FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT, MAN, THAT'S SOME CHANGES. EVEN WHEN I DID THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' ASSOCIATION DINNER, WHEN I DID THAT, THEY HAD TO MAKE SOME CHANGES. THEY HAD TO ADJUST. YEAH. HOUR BEFORE MY PERFORMANCE, MY PUBLICIST COMES TO ME, SHE GOES, "WANDA, THEY, UH, THEY WANT ME TO GIVE YOU THIS NOTE." I'M LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, WHAT IS IT?" SHE SAID, "WELL, THEY SAID, 'PLEASE DON'T USE THE F-WORD OR THE N-WORD." AND I SAID, "HMM... I GOT A FEELING THEY DIDN'T GIVE THIS NOTE OUT LAST YEAR." I MEAN, I DIDN'T SEE IT LAST YEAR, BUT DID RICH LITTLE GO OUT THERE AND SAY, "FUCK YOU, NIGGA" TO GEORGE BUSH? 'CAUSE... I MEAN, HE WAS AN AWFUL PRESIDENT, BUT "FUCK YOU, NIGGA" IS TOO OVER THE LINE. THAT'S JUST... DO YOU HAVE TO GIVE THAT NOTE? REALLY, COME ON! IT'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THE FIRST LADY IS THERE. ALL THESE DIGNITARIES ARE THERE. DID THEY REALLY THINK I WAS GONNA GO IN THERE AND GO, "NIGGA, YOU THE FUCKING PRESIDENT! NIGGA! YOU THE MOTHERFUCKING PRESIDENT! GIVE ME SOME RIGHT HERE. COME ON, NIGGA, HIT THAT. HIT THAT, NIGGA, HIT THAT." WHAT THE FUCK?! YOU GOT TO BE ONE IGNORANT NIGGA TO DO SOME SHIT LIKE THAT! SO I HAD TO REWRITE MY ACT IN AN HOUR. ( audience laughing, cheering ) UH. WE GOTTA MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS, MAN, YOU KNOW, GOTTA GET USED TO HAVING A BLACK FIRST LADY. GOTTA GET USED TO THAT, RIGHT? THAT'S WHY WE HAD ALL THOSE ARTICLES, YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY FIRST GOT IN OFFICE, LIKE, "WHO IS THE REAL MICHELLE OBAMA? WHEN WILL WE SEE THE REAL MICHELLE OBAMA?" YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING? WHEN ARE WE GONNA SEE THIS... "NO, YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR BABY! YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR BABY!" ( audience laughing, cheering ) WELL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE THAT FROM MICHELLE OBAMA, AND WE ALL DON'T DO THAT. AND I HAPPEN TO KNOW FOR A FACT THAT DURING THE CAMPAIGN, SHE HAD RODS IMPLANTED IN HER NECK SO SHE IS INCAPABLE OF DOING THAT. YOU SEE SOMETIMES SHE WANTS TO, BUT SHE CAN'T. SHE'S JUST... IT'S LIKE EVERYBODY'S JUST WAITING FOR ONE OF THOSE RODS TO SNAP AND FOR HER TO GET PISSED ONE NIGHT AND THROW ALL HIS SHIT OUT ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN. "FUCK YOU, BARACK! YOU AIN'T SHIT! YOU AIN'T SHIT!" MICHELLE'S MOTHER COMES TO THE DOOR, "BABY, PLEASE, MICHELLE, YOU GONNA GET THAT BOY IMPEACHED! PLEASE, BABY! GET IN THE HOUSE. GET IN THE HOUSE. WHITE PEOPLE ARE LOOKIN' AT YOU!" WE GOTTA GET USED TO HAVING A BEAUTIFUL FIRST LADY, TOO. FIRST LADY. FIRST LADY WHO LIKES TO SHOW SOME SKIN. I LIKE THAT. GIVING HER SOME SHIT 'CAUSE SHE WENT SLEEVELESS. THE COUNTRY IS BROKE. SLEEVES COST MONEY, ALL RIGHT? GAVE HER SHIT 'CAUSE SHE WAS WEARING SHORTS. I LIKE THAT. SHE SHOULD SHOW HER SKIN. SHE HAS BEAUTIFUL SKIN, SHE HAS BEAUTIFUL ARMS. SHOW THOSE ARMS OFF. NOW, SOME OF THE PREVIOUS FIRST LADIES, YEAH, THEY NEEDED SLEEVES. BARBARA BUSH SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN A PONCHO THE WHOLE TIME. ALL THAT FLAPPING AROUND. NOBODY WANTED TO SEE THAT. I WAS LIKE, "AT LEAST TATTOO THE FLAG ON THERE OR SOMETHING." I LOVE THAT. SHOW YOUR ARMS OFF, MICHELLE. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU GOT NICE ARMS. AND PLUS, YOU LET ALL THOSE OTHER LITTLE FLOOZY GIRLS OUT THERE, LET ALL THEM LITTLE INTERNS AND SHIT KNOW, LET 'EM KNOW, "ALL RIGHT, YOU COULD TRY SOME SHIT WITH MY MAN IF YOU WANT TO, BUT YOU GONNA GET ONE OF THESE BABIES AROUND YOUR SCRAWNY NECK!" BUT I DON'T EVEN THINK WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING GOING ON OR ANYBODY MESSING WITH HIM OR THEM MESSING AROUND 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, I MET THEM AT THAT DINNER AND YOU COULD FEEL THE ENERGY BETWEEN THEM. LET ME TELL YOU, THEY FUCKING. OH YEAH. THERE IS SOME FUCKING GOING ON AT 1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. THEY SHOULD PUT A SIGN OUT ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN, "IF THE WHITE HOUSE IS A-ROCKIN', DON'T COME A-KNOCKIN'." THERE'S SOME GOOD, HOT SEX GOING ON THERE, I MEAN, WE'RE TALKING ASS SLAPPING, HIP PULLING. "OH, YOU WANT MY STIMULUS PACKAGE, HUH? YOU WANT MY STIMULUS PACKAGE, HUH? YOU WANT MY STIMULUS PACKAGE?" "YES, DADDY! GIVE ME THE PACKAGE, DADDY! REGULATE IT! REGULATE!" AND I KNOW I KEEP SAYING "THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT," AND YES, I KNOW THAT HE'S BIRACIAL, BUT I DON'T CARE. HE'S THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT. WELL... THAT'S UNLESS HE FUCKS UP. AND IF HE FUCKS UP, I'M GONNA BE THE FIRST ONE TO SAY, "WHO VOTED FOR THE HALF-WHITE GUY? GET THAT MULATTO OUTTA THERE! HE STINKS!" AND THERE'S A LOT OF AREAS WHERE HE CAN FUCK UP 'CAUSE, GOOD LORD, THE MAN GOT PROBLEMS ALL OVER THE PLACE, HUH? ALL KIND OF PROBLEMS, AND THEN PEOPLE FUCKING WITH HIM FOR STUFF THAT, YOU KNOW, JUST LIKE SHIT THEY SHOULDN'T BE BOTHERING HIM WITH, YOU KNOW, LIKE CRITICIZING HIM ABOUT THEIR CHOICE OF DOG, WHAT KIND OF DOG ARE THEY GONNA GET. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, SPCA GOT ON THEM ABOUT, "OH, HOW COME HE DIDN'T GET A SHELTER DOG? HOW COME THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T GET A RESCUE DOG? HE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN A RESCUE DOG." I'M LIKE, THE MAN HAS TO RESCUE A COUNTRY THAT'S BEEN ABUSED BY ITS PREVIOUS OWNER. ( audience laughing, cheering ) LET HIM HAVE A FRESH START WITH A DOG. DAMN! AND THEN, YOU KNOW, THERE WERE PROBLEMS THAT OUT OF NOWHERE, NOT JUST YOUR NORMAL PROBLEMS, LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE ECONOMY AND THE TWO WARS THAT ARE GOING ON. NO, THEN HE STARTED GETTING ALL THESE EXTRA PROBLEMS LIKE SWINE FLU AND PIRATES?! WHAT THE FUCK?! PIRATES?! REALLY?! PIRATES? WHERE THE FUCK DID PIRATES COME FROM?! I BET YOU HE THOUGHT THAT RAHM EMANUEL WAS PUNKING HIM WHEN HE CAME IN THERE WITH THAT SHIT. "MR. PRESIDENT, ONE OF OUR VESSELS HAS BEEN TAKEN BY PIRATES." "THAT'S A GOOD ONE, RON. GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE." PIRATES! I WAS SO PISSED WHEN I SAW THAT. I'M LIKE, "PIRATES?" AND THEN WHEN I LOOKED, I WAS LIKE, "THESE AREN'T PIRATES. THOSE MOTHERFUCKERS DON'T LOOK LIKE PIRATES! THEY LOOK LIKE A BUNCH OF CARJACKERS ON WATER." WHY ARE WE FUCKING WITH THESE LITTLE KIDS? IT'S LIKE, "OH WELL, THEY HAVE MACHINE GUNS." WHAT-- HAVE YOU SEEN HOW BIG THESE CARGO SHIPS ARE? THEY'RE ENORMOUS! THEY HAVE MACHINE GUNS? WELL, ONLY WAY A GUN CAN HURT YOU WHEN YOU'RE ON THAT SHIP IS IF YOU STICK YOUR STUPID HEAD OFF THE SIDE... AND LOOK DOWN AT THE PIRATES. AND WHO ARE THESE SHITTY-ASS CAPTAINS ALLOWING THESE LITTLE KIDS TO TAKE THEIR BIG-ASS BOAT? THAT'S A SHITTY CAPTAIN. IF I'M THE CAPTAIN, I'D SAY, "UH, CAPTAIN, THERE'S SOME PIRATES, UH... YEAH, THERE'S SOME PIRATES DOWN THERE. WELL YEAH, I JUST CAUGHT A BULLET. LOOK. SEE? YEAH, PIRATES ARE DOWN THERE." YOU'RE THE CAPTAIN! ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS TAKE THAT WHEEL AND DO ONE OF THESE... "OH YEAH, THEY'RE GONE. THEY'RE GONE." ( audience applauding ) FUCKIN' PIRATES. I WAS SO PISSED. YOU KNOW, THE ONE THAT WE CAUGHT, WE SHOULD MAKE AN EXAMPLE OUT OF HIM. YEAH, THEY SHOULD CHOP HIS LEG OFF AND STICK A BROOM HANDLE UP THERE, PUT A HOOK ON HIS HAND, STICK A PARROT ON HIS SHOULDER, SLAP AN EYE PATCH ON HIM, AND KICK HIS ASS BACK TO SOMALIA. THAT'S A FUCKIN' PIRATE! ( audience cheering ) HE'S GOT SOME FAKE PROBLEMS, AND HE HAS REAL PROBLEMS. REFORM AND HEALTH CARE, OH MY GOD. THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM RIGHT THERE. THIS SHIT IS CRAZY! AND PEOPLE ARE JUST NUTS-- JUST NUTS. YOU KNOW, SCARING THE SHIT OUT OF OLD PEOPLE, TALKING ABOUT DEATH PANELS. "OH, THEY'RE GONNA PULL THE PLUG ON GRANDMA." JUST SCARING THE SHIT OUT OF OLD PEOPLE! I MEAN, REALLY, SINCE WHEN HAVE WE BEEN THAT NATION? WHY WOULD THEY EVEN BELIEVE THAT? YOU THINK WE JUST START KILLING PEOPLE 'CAUSE THEY'RE OLD? THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO. YOU THINK WE'RE JUST GONNA BE WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND GO, "OH, YOU'RE AN OLD MAN. EXCUSE ME, SIR. HOW OLD ARE YOU? 78?! YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD THREE YEARS AGO!" IS THAT IT? ALL IT IS IS JUST YOUR MEDICAL DIRECTIVES, THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT. YOU JUST HAVE THE END-OF-LIFE CONSULTATION-- THAT'S ALL, TO DECIDE WHAT YOU WANNA DO, THAT'S IT. I HAVE A MEDICAL DIRECTIVE. I HAVE THAT. YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE IF I DIDN'T, THEN YOUR NEXT OF KIN, YOU KNOW, WOULD HAVE THE DECISION. AND I HAVE KIDS, AND I DON'T TRUST THOSE MOTHERFUCKERS! I CAN SEE ME THERE, I'M LAID UP IN THE HOSPITAL WITH A BROKEN HIP AND I COULD JUST HEAR 'EM-- "PULL THE PLUG! PULL THE PLUG!" "I CAN HEAR YOU, ASSHOLE! I BROKE MY HIP, NOT MY EARDRUMS! DUMB BASTARD!" I WENT SO FAR AS I EVEN PLANNED MY OWN FUNERAL. I TOLD THEM WHAT TO DO WITH MY BODY. I SAID, "LOOK, I'M AN ORGAN DONOR, SO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS, - AND THE REST OF IT JUST--" - ( audience cheering ) I SAID, "THE REST OF IT, JUST BURN IT UP. BURN IT UP." AND THEY WAS LIKE, "WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH THE ASHES?" I SAID, "SPREAD 'EM OVER HALLE BERRY. ( audience laughing, cheering ) SHE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BE AT THE FUNERAL. JUST CATCH HER ASS ON THE STREET ONE DAY." WOULDN'T YOU LOVE TO SEE THAT RED-CARPET ARRIVAL? YOU SITTING THERE WATCHING THE OSCARS. "SO, HALLE, WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?" ONE OF MY FRIENDS RUNS UP-- "WANDA SYKES!" I'M GLAD SOME OF YOU ALL APPLAUDED WHEN I SAID "ORGAN DONOR" BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY MORE PEOPLE ARE NOT ORGAN DONORS. ( audience applauding ) WE ALL REALLY SHOULD BE ORGAN DONORS. I MEAN, COME ON, WHY ARE YOU HOLDING ON TO IT? YOU'RE DEAD. GIVE IT UP. LET SOMEBODY ELSE USE IT. I HOPE WHOEVER GETS MY LIVER-- GOD BLESS 'EM. THERE AIN'T GONNA BE MUCH LEFT ON IT. ( chuckles ) BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO GIVE, YOU KNOW, AND THEN SOME PEOPLE SAY, "WELL, IT'S MY RELIGION." WHAT DO YOU MEAN-- WHAT KIND OF RELIGION IS THAT? THAT'S THE MOST LOVING THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO GIVE SOMEBODY OF YOURSELF, TO HELP SOMEBODY, RIGHT? AND IT'S LIKE, "WHAT, YOUR GOD IS KINDA CRAZY OR SOMETHING? YOU'RE SCARED WHEN YOU GET TO HEAVEN YOUR GOD GONNA BE LIKE, "WHERE THE HELL ARE YOUR EYES? AIN'T THIS A BITCH? YOU UP HERE WITH EMPTY EYE SOCKETS. WHAT THE-- WHERE ARE YOUR EYES?! YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE ALL THIS PRETTY SHIT I GOT UP HERE FOR YOU." I'M AN ORGAN DONOR, BUT I HAD TO STOP THERE. I COULDN'T LEAVE MY BODY TO SCIENCE. I COULDN'T DO THAT. I MEAN, COME ON. I DON'T WANNA END UP A CADAVER. I MEAN, COME ON, PEOPLE KNOW ME. I DON'T WANT TO END UP WITH SOME STUPID MED STUDENT. THEY'RE LIKE, "HEY, GUYS, LOOK! I GOT WANDA SYKES!" THEY PROP ME UP AND PUT A MIKE IN MY HAND. I DRAW THE LINE. WELL, PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO DO CHANGE. IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO DO CHANGE, YOU KNOW. IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO REFORM HEALTH CARE BECAUSE WE THINK OUR SHIT IS THE BEST. AND IT'S NOT, BUT WE THINK OUR SHIT IS THE BEST, RIGHT? AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S SO FUNNY? WHEN YOU LEAVE THE COUNTRY, YOU FIND THAT OTHER PEOPLE, THEY THINK THEIR SHIT IS THE BEST, TOO. YEAH. I WENT TO BRAZIL, AND I TOOK A LITTLE JUNGLE TOUR. YEAH, BUT IT WAS BASICALLY A JEEP RIDE THROUGH THAT NATIONAL PARK. I-- OH, DON'T THINK I WAS FUCKING AROUND IN THE RAINFOREST AND SHIT. NO, THANK YOU. YEAH, THEY BUILD A FOUR SEASONS IN THE RAINFOREST, THEN MAYBE I'LL CHECK IT OUT, BUT SHIT. AIN'T FOR ME. SO, WE'RE ON THIS JEEP TOUR, RIGHT? AND OUR GUIDE, HE JUST STOPS THE JEEP. HE'S LIKE, "LISTEN. LISTEN." HE WAS LIKE, "YOU HEAR THAT? THAT IS OUR BIRD. AND WHEN OUR BIRD MAKES THAT NOISE, WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SAME WEATHER TOMORROW THAT WE'RE HAVING TODAY." I WAS LIKE, "MM-HMM, OKAY." AND MY WIFE IS FROM FRANCE, YOU KNOW, SO SHE JUMPS UP-- "OH, IN FRANCE, WE HAVE A BIRD, AND WHEN THE BIRD FLIES HIGH, WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE SUNNY THE NEXT DAY, AND IF IT FLIES LOW, THEN WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO RAIN." SO, I'M LOOKING AT THE TWO OF THESE DUMMIES... I'M LIKE, "WELL, IN MY COUNTRY, WE HAVE THE METEOROLOGIST. ( audience cheering ) AND AL ROKER TELLS US WHAT THE WEATHER'S GONNA BE LIKE FOR THE NEXT FIVE DAYS. SO FUCK YOUR BIRDS." LUCKY FOR ME, IT WASN'T A LONG WALK BACK TO THE HOTEL. IT'S HARD TO CHANGE. WE DON'T WANNA CHANGE. WE THINK OUR SHIT IS THE BEST. LIKE THE METRIC SYSTEM. WE HAVE STILL NOT CONVERTED TO THE METRIC SYSTEM. DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO CONVERT TO THE METRIC SYSTEM? SINCE 1875! THE WHOLE REST OF THE WORLD-- WE'RE THE ONLY INDUSTRIALIZED NATION THAT STILL HAS NOT CONVERTED TO THE METRIC SYSTEM. YEAH, EVERYBODY ELSE IS WITH THE METRIC. EVERYBODY ELSE IS LIKE, "OH, IT'S VERY SIMPLE. IT'S JUST BASED ON A SYSTEM OF TENS." WE LIKE, "HMM-MM." WE LIKE OUR TWELVES AND TEASPOONS, CUP, PINT-- I LIKE ALL THAT-- FEET, YARDS-- WE LIKE ALL THAT SHIT. EVERYBODY WENT METRIC. I REMEMBER BEING IN GRADE SCHOOL LIKE BACK IN '75 AND THEY TRIED TO TEACH US THE METRIC SYSTEM. YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE RUSSIANS HAD LANDED AT OUR FRONT DOOR. OH MY GOD! EVERYBODY WAS CRYING. THE TEACHERS WERE CRYING 'CAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT SHIT EITHER. IT WAS SAD, MAN. EVERYBODY JUST SAID, "FUCK IT. WE AIN'T DOING THAT SHIT." THE UNITED STATES JUST GAVE THE REST OF THE WORLD A BIG FINGER AND SAID, "FUCK YOUR METRIC SYSTEM." IT IS SAD, MAN. THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO USE THE METRIC SYSTEM ARE DOCTORS, RIGHT? AND I FEEL SORRY FOR THE DOCTORS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GIVE US OUR DIAGNOSIS IN FRUIT. YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR AND THEY SAY, "UH, YOU HAVE A TUMOR." "OH OKAY. HOW BIG IS IT, DOC?" ( audience laughing ) "NINE CENTIMETERS." AND THEN YOU GOTTA LOOK AT THE DOCTOR AND LOOK AT HIS FACE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW BAD IT IS. YOU'RE LIKE... THEN THE DOCTOR GETS SICK OF LOOKING AT YOUR STUPID FACE. HE GOES, "YOU HAVE A GRAPEFRUIT." "OH SHIT, A GRAPEFRUIT! OH, DOC! WE GOTTA GET THAT OUTTA THERE! THAT'S GOTTA COME OUT, RIGHT? 'CAUSE I KNOW, LIKE, GRAPES YOU CAN KEEP AN EYE ON, BUT GRAPEFRUIT, THAT'S GOTTA GO. WE GOTTA GET THAT OUT." WE'RE A NATION OF DUMMIES. WE ARE! DON'T WANNA LEARN NEW SHIT, OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM STINKS-- WE REALLY DO NEED TO REVAMP OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. IT DOESN'T WORK. IT DOES NOT WORK. ( audience applauding, cheering ) THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SHOWS-- "ARE YOU SMARTER THAN A 5th GRADER?" YOU KNOW HOW PISS POOR THAT IS?! AND I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYBODY WIN. PEOPLE SIT-- SIT THERE AT HOME PLAYING ALONG-- "OOH, I THINK I KNOW THIS ONE." YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO! YOU'RE 32, YOU DUMB MOTHERFUCKER! WE NEED TO JUST REVAMP OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW WHAT, WE DON'T LEARN ANYTHING. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT COMPREHENSION. IT'S JUST RETENTION. IT'S JUST ROTE, THAT'S IT. WE NEVER GET IT. WE JUST KEEP IT LONG ENOUGH TO SPIT IT BACK OUT, PASS THE TEST, AND WE GET RID OF THAT SHIT, RIGHT? IT'S LIKE THE TEACHER GIVES YOU SOMETHING. YOU GO, "OKAY OKAY, I GOT THAT." THE TIME FOR THE TEST-- "OKAY, HERE YOU GO. GIVING IT BACK TO YOU." DONE WITH THAT, IT'S LIKE OUR BRAIN'S A BIG ETCH A SKETCH. WE GO... "OKAY. NEXT SUBJECT." IMMIGRATION. THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM. THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM ON THE PRESIDENT'S DESK, RIGHT? ANOTHER PROBLEM. IMMIGRATION. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT REALLY PISSES ME OFF WHEN PEOPLE CALL THEM "ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS--" "OH, THESE ARE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS." YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING ILLEGAL. THEY'RE JUST UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS, THAT'S IT. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT ANYTHING LIKE CRIMINAL. I MEAN, REALLY, IF SOMEBODY BROKE INTO MY HOUSE AND VACUUMED... YOU KNOW, I MIGHT BE A LITTLE CONFUSED, BUT I AIN'T CALLING THE COPS. BUT SOME PEOPLE GET SO ARROGANT, BOY, GET SO ARROGANT, SO HARD ON THE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS, GET SO HARD ON PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T BORN HERE. YOU KNOW, LIKE, COME ON. THEY JUST WANNA COME HERE FOR A BETTER LIFE. GIVE 'EM A FAIR SHAKE. YOU KNOW, AND PLUS... ( audience cheering ) AND PLUS, THERE'S A FEW AMERICANS I WOULD LOVE TO TRADE OUT FOR A COUPLE OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS. SHIT, I'LL TAKE TWO GUATEMALANS, A MEXICAN, AND A BOATLOAD OF HAITIANS FOR OCTOMOM ANY DAY! ( audience cheering ) SHE'S GOT TO GO. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF CHANGE GOING ON, BUT THEN SOME THINGS JUST REMAIN THE SAME. SOME THINGS REMAIN THE SAME. BLACK MEN STILL GOTTA WATCH THEIR BACK, STILL GOTTA-- AIN'T NO FREE RIDE NOW, AIN'T NO FREEDOM, "DO WHATEVER I WANNA DO--" HUH-HUH, GOTTA WATCH YOURSELF. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THERE'S ONE GROUP WHO CAN GO ANYWHERE, DO ANYTHING THAT THEY WANNA DO, YOU KNOW WHO CAN MOVE AROUND FREELY? A MEXICAN WITH A LEAF BLOWER. I'M TELLING YOU, A MEXICAN WITH A LEAF BLOWER CAN GO ANY-FUCKING-WHERE THEY WANNA GO. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT LEAF BLOWER THAT JUST HYPNOTIZES YOU. ( mimicking leaf blower ) YOU GET THE FUCK OUT THE WAY. YOU BE YELLING AT YOUR FRIENDS, "GET THE FUCK OUT THE WAY! YOU SEE THE MAN COMING THROUGH WITH THE LEAF BLOWER. COME ON IN, SIR. COME RIGHT THIS WAY." ( mimicking leaf blower ) IF I EVER WANTED TO KIDNAP THE PRESIDENT, I WILL HIRE MEXICANS WITH LEAF BLOWERS, I'M TELLING YOU. THEY'RE-- ( mimicking leaf blower ) THEY'D BLOW RIGHT PAST SECRET SERVICE. ( mimicking leaf blower ) "OKAY, EVERYBODY, BACK UP. BACK UP, EVERYONE. NO NO, IT'S A MEXICAN WITH A LEAF BLOWER. PLEASE LET HIM THROUGH. LET HIM THROUGH. GET OUTTA THE WAY. GET OUTTA THE WAY. YES YES, AND HE'S MEXICAN, I SAW HIM. IT IS NOT A THREAT." ( mimicking leaf blower ) THEY WALK OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE WITH THE PRESIDENT IN A BIG PLASTIC GREEN BAG. ( mimicking leaf blower ) CHANGE, MAN. CHANGE IS HARD. IT'S HARD TO MAKE CHANGES. HARD TO MAKE CHANGES. LOOK AT HOW HARD IT WAS FOR US TO GET A FIRST LATINO JUDGE, HUH? - YEAH, JUSTICE-- - ( audience applauding ) JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR. SO HAPPY SHE GOT ON. LOOK, THEY GAVE HER SO MUCH SHIT. YOU KNOW, ISN'T IT FUNNY THAT THE ONLY TIME YOUR RACE OR GENDER IS QUESTIONED IS WHEN YOU'RE NOT A WHITE MAN? ( audience applauding ) 'CAUSE I THINK WHITE MEN, THEY GET UPSET. THEY GET NERVOUS-- LIKE, A MINORITY OR ANOTHER RACE GETS A LITTLE POWER, IT MAKES THEM NERVOUS 'CAUSE THEY SCARED THAT THAT RACE IS GONNA DO TO THEM WHAT THEY DID TO THAT RACE. THEY GET NERVOUS. SO THEY START SCREAMING, "REVERSE RACISM! THIS IS REVERSE RACISM." I'M LIKE, WAIT A MINUTE. ISN'T REVERSE RACISM, ISN'T THAT WHEN A RACE IS NICE TO SOMEBODY ELSE? ISN'T THAT? TO OTHER PEOPLE? THAT'S REVERSE RACISM. WHAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF IS CALLED KARMA. ( audience laughing, applauding ) YEAH. I'M SO HAPPY SHE'S ON THE BENCH. I'M SO HAPPY SHE'S ON THE BENCH. YOU KNOW, GOOD FOR HER, AND ALL THE PROBLEMS THEY GAVE HER AND TALKING SHIT, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE SHE'S ON THERE NOW. SO, ONCE YOU'RE ON THE BENCH, ONCE YOU'RE A JUSTICE, YOU'RE ALWAYS A JUSTICE. SO IF I WAS HER, THE FIRST DAY, I WOULD HAVE WALKED IN THERE WEARING A ROBE MADE OUT OF THE PUERTO RICAN FLAG. iMIRA! iMIRA! EVERY TIME JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS SAYS SOMETHING, SHE SHOULD JUST ROLL HER EYES AND GO, "PFFT, THAT WAS DUMB." A LOT CHANGES, MAN. I HAD A LOT OF PERSONAL CHANGES GOING ON IN MY LIFE. I HAD A PERSONAL CHANGE-- I GOT MARRIED. - ( audience cheering ) - YEP, I GOT MARRIED. HAPPILY MARRIED. I GOT MARRIED IN CALIFORNIA, YOU KNOW. THEN I HAD TO PUBLICLY COME OUT. I HAD TO DO THAT. I HAD TO. I HAD TO DO IT, ESPECIALLY AFTER PROP 8-- AFTER THAT PROP 8 FIASCO IN CALIFORNIA, I HAD TO COME OUT. I HAD TO SAY SOMETHING 'CAUSE I WAS SO HURT AND SO FUCKING PISSED. I HAD TO SAY SOMETHING. HAD TO SAY SOMETHING, MAN. 'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? IT WAS LIKE THAT NIGHT WAS CRAZY. BLACK PRESIDENT-- YAY! OH, PROP 8 PASSED-- OH SHIT. NOW I'M A SECOND-CLASS CITIZEN. WHAT THE FUCK?! I WAS UP HERE, NOW I'M BACK DOWN HERE. ACTUALLY, I'M LOWER. I DROPPED LOWER. YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE AS A BLACK WOMAN-- AT LEAST A BLACK WOMAN, I COULD DO WHATEVER, MARRY WHOEVER, BUT AS A GAY BLACK WOMAN-- HUH-UH, EVEN LOWER. AND I THINK ABOUT IT, I WAS LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT? IT IS HARDER. IT'S HARDER. IT'S HARDER BEING GAY THAN IT IS BEING BLACK. IT IS CAUSE THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT I HAD-- THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT I HAD TO DO AS GAY THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO AS BLACK. I DIDN'T HAVE TO COME OUT BLACK. ( audience laughing, cheering ) I DIDN'T HAVE TO SIT MY PARENTS DOWN AND TELL THEM ABOUT MY BLACKNESS. I DIDN'T HAVE TO SIT THEM DOWN-- "MOM, DAD, I GOTTA TELL Y'ALL SOMETHING. I HOPE YOU'LL STILL LOVE ME. I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT. MOM, DAD... I'M BLACK." "WHAT?! WHAT DID SHE JUST SAY? OH, LORD JESUS! SHE DIDN'T SAY BLACK, LORD. DID SHE SAY BLACK?" "MOM, I'M BLACK." "OH NO, LORD JESUS! NOT BLACK, FATHER GOD! OH, NOT BLACK, LORD! ANYTHING BUT BLACK, JESUS! GIVE HER CANCER, LORD! GIVE HER CANCER! ANYTHING BUT BLACK, LORD!" IT'S LIKE, "MOM, YEAH, I'M BLACK. THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS." "NO. NO, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'VE BEEN HANGING AROUND BLACK PEOPLE. YOU'VE BEEN HANGING AROUND BLACK PEOPLE AND THEY GOT YOU THINKING YOU BLACK. THEY TWISTED YOUR MIND!" IT'S LIKE, "NO, MOM, I'M BLACK. THAT'S JUST-- THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS." "WHAT... WHAT DID I DO? WHAT DID I DO? I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET YOU WATCH 'SOUL TRAIN.' WAS IT 'SOUL TRAIN'?" "NO, MA, IT WASN'T 'SOUL TRAIN,' MA. IT'S JUST... IT'S JUST WHO I AM. I WAS JUST BORN BLACK." "OH, YOU WEREN'T BORN BLACK. I DON'T WANNA HEAR THAT. HUH-UH, YOU WEREN'T BORN BLACK. THE BIBLE SAYS ADAM AND EVE, NOT ADAM AND MARY J. BLIGE." I THINK THE PROBLEM MOST PEOPLE HAVE WITH HOMOSEXUALITY IS, YOU KNOW, THEIR RELIGION, AND ALSO THEY THINK IT'S A CHOICE. BEING GAY IS NOT A CHOICE. - IT'S NOT A CHOICE. - ( audience cheering ) IT IS NOT A CHOICE. AND SO IF YOU BELIEVE THAT IT'S A CHOICE, THEN YOU'RE SAYING THAT STRAIGHT PEOPLE ARE STRAIGHT BECAUSE THEY CHOSE NOT TO BE GAY, RIGHT? AND I'M SURE A LOT OF STRAIGHT GUYS IN HERE, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I'M SURE THERE'S SEVERAL OCCASIONS, YOU PROBABLY THINK, "YOU KNOW, I THINK I'M GONNA SUCK A DICK TODAY. NAH, I CHOOSE NOT TO." IT'S FUNNY. IT'S GREAT BEING OUT. I LOVE BEING PUBLICLY OUT, JUST EVERYTHING OUT ON THE TABLE. I AM WHAT I AM. THAT'S IT. HAPPY ABOUT IT. NOW I GET TO GET INVITED TO ALL THE BIG GAY EVENTS, TOO, AND BOY, THERE'S A LOT OF 'EM. WHEW! GOOD GRIEF. BUT YOU KNOW, ONE I GOT TO DO-- I HAD A GREAT TIME-- I DID A GAY CRUISE. YEAH. GAY CRUISE. ME AND 3200 GAY MEN. I WAS THE ONLY ONE WEARING A SHIRT. AND YOU TALK ABOUT PARTY? OH MY GOD. THEY PARTIED THEY ASSES OFF NONSTOP, JUST PARTY, PARTY, PARTY, PARTY. AND I CAN STILL HEAR THAT MUSIC IN MY HEAD, THAT... ( mimicking techno music ) ( mimicking electronic shriek ) "WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?! ARE THERE PIRATES? ARE THERE PIRATES? WHAT IS THAT?!" PARTY, MAN, THE MUSIC, THE LIGHTS, THE LASER BEAMS, THE SMOKE MACHINES, AND ALL THAT WAS JUST COMING FROM THE CABIN NEXT DOOR. THEY PARTY HARD, MAN. AND ALSO I GOT SOME FREE TIME, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE MY SHOWS WERE AT NIGHT, SO DURING THE DAY, WE GOT TO HANG OUT, YOU KNOW, I GO ON THE POOL DECK AND HANG OUT AND, YOU KNOW, MY FRIENDS WERE WITH ME, AND MY WIFE WAS WITH ME. WE WERE JUST HANGING OUT, RIGHT? AND... AND... SHE GETS UP AND SHE STARTS WALKING TOWARDS THE POOL. AND I'M LOOKING, I'M LIKE, "HEY, BABY, BABY. ( whispering ) COME HERE. COME HERE." AND SO SHE WALKS BACK. SHE'S LIKE, "WHAT'S WRONG?" I WAS LIKE, "DON'T GET IN THAT POOL. GETTING IN THAT POOL IS LIKE SWIMMING IN A BOWL OF DICK SOUP. YOU OUT THERE BACKSTROKING IN A BOWL OF BALL BOUILLABAISSE, JUST..." I SAID, "YOU GET IN THAT POOL, NINE MONTHS LATER, WE'RE SITTING ON MAURY POVICH TRYING TO FIND THE BABY DADDY." AND THEY ASKED ME TO DO ANOTHER ONE. I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, I'LL DO ANOTHER ONE, BUT THIS TIME, WE GONNA HAVE A DRESS CODE. YEAH, 'CAUSE THAT JOCKSTRAP LOOK WASN'T WORKING FOR EVERYBODY. THEY'RE WALKING AROUND, ALL THE LITTLE KIBBLES AND BITS HANGING OUT. OH, AND THEY GOT REAL DODGY AROUND THE BREAKFAST BUFFET. I'M JUST GOING THROUGH THE LINE, AND THEY JUST WALKING THROUGH. ( audience laughing ) "UH... EXCUSE ME. UH, CAN YOU GET YOUR DICK OUT MY OMELET, PLEASE? YOU DON'T FEEL THAT? YOUR DICK IS IN MY OMELET, MAN. NO, I ASKED FOR A DENVER OMELET, NOT A MAN FROM DENVER WITH HIS DICK IN MY OMELET. NO, YOU KEEP THAT. YOU KEEP THAT." BIG CHANGES, MAN. BIG CHANGES. I'M A NEW MOM, A NEW MOM. - ( audience cheering ) - YES! I'VE HAD TWINS-- A BOY AND A GIRL. YEP, VERY HAPPY. YOU KNOW, I KNOW IN THE PAST, I'VE SAID QUITE A FEW THINGS ABOUT KIDS AND ABOUT HOW THEY RUIN YOUR LIFE AND THEY'RE AWFUL, AND I WAS RIGHT. THEY DO RUIN YOUR LIFE, BUT THEY GIVE YOU A NEW LIFE. THAT'S THE THING-- THEY GIVE YOU A NEW LIFE, AND I'M LOVING IT. I'M LOVING EVERY SECOND OF IT. LOVING EVERY SECOND OF IT. I STARTED A LITTLE LATE, 'CAUSE YOU KNOW, 45-- SO YOU KNOW, STARTED, YOU KNOW, KIDS AT 45, THAT'S A LITTLE LATE IN THE GAME, BUT IT DOES STICK IN MY MIND ABOUT THE AGE THING, AND THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS, LIKE, TALK TO MY KIDS A LOT, JUST TALK TO 'EM, YOU KNOW, AND ESPECIALLY THE BOY, LUCAS-- I TALK TO HIM ALL THE TIME, ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M CHANGING HIM, YOU KNOW-- "OKAY, LUCAS, YOU SEE HOW MOMMY HAS THE LIGHTS NICE AND LOW AND NOT TOO BRIGHT IN YOUR EYES AND GOT YOUR LITTLE LULLABIES PLAYING, THE MUSIC YOU LIKE. SEE? UH-HUH. OKAY NOW, NOT TOO TIGHT ON YOUR ANKLES, RIGHT? OKAY, LET ME GET THE LITTLE TOWELETTE, AND SEE, IT'S NICE AND WARM. YEAH! YOU LIKE THAT, RIGHT? OKAY NOW, YOU GO FROM FRONT TO BACK, OKAY? CLEAN TO DIRTY. CLEAN TO DIRTY. CLEAN TO DIRTY. NOW, I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THIS SO WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR MAMA, YOU DO IT RIGHT, OKAY? CLEAN TO DIRTY." THE BIGGEST THINK ABOUT BEING A NEW MOM IS THAT WITH KIDS, YOU'RE TIRED. YOU'RE JUST TIRED ALL THE TIME. I'M ALWAYS TIRED. I'M TIRED NOW. JUST TIRED, RIGHT? AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE CHEAT, YOU KNOW, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY HAVE NEW KIDS AND THEY CHEAT. WHERE THE FUCK DO YOU GET THE ENERGY TO CHEAT? SHIT, I TOLD MY WIFE. I SAID, "LOOK, IF YOU EVER CATCH ME IN ANOTHER WOMAN'S BED, YOU KNOW I'M JUST THERE FOR A NAP." I'M LIKE, "BABY, SHE HAD DOWN PILLOWS. I'M SORRY!" THE KIDS ARE AWESOME, MAN, THEY ARE. AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY WHEN YOU'RE FIGURING THEM OUT BECAUSE THEY CHANGE EVERY DAY, THERE'S ALWAYS SOME CHANGE, YOU KNOW. AND LIKE, THE BOY-- LUCAS-- OH BOY, HE IS SO SIMPLE. AND, GUYS, I DON'T MEAN ANYTHING DEROGATORY ABOUT THAT, THAT GUYS ARE SIMPLE, BUT LUCAS, WHEN HE CRIES, IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S A REASON. WHEN LUCAS CRIES, MAYBE HE'S HUNGRY. LUCAS CRIES, HE'S SLEEPY, OR LUCAS CRIES, HE NEEDS HIS DIAPER CHANGED. IT'S VERY SIMPLE. YOU GET IT. OLIVIA-- I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT GIRL! SHE CAN CRY FOR ANY DAMN THING! LIKE A LEAF FALLS-- ( mimicking crying ) ONE NIGHT SHE WAS CRYING SO BAD, MY WIFE AND I COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT. WE JUST STARTED REARRANGING FURNITURE. "MAYBE SHE WANTS THE SOFA OVER HERE. PUT THAT-- JUST PUT THE DAMN SOFA OVER HERE! OKAY, TURN THAT LAMP OFF. ALL RIGHT! OKAY YEAH, OPEN THAT SHADE. DO THIS." CRIES FOR ANY FUCKING THING. ( mimics crying ) "CLOSE THE REFRIGERATOR. OLIVIA'S CRYING. CLOSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOOR. CLOSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOOR." JUST CRYING FOR NO REASON. JUST... ( mimics crying ) WELL, I WAS ON NIGHT SHIFT, SO I HAD HER ONE NIGHT, RIGHT? SO SHE WAS JUST SITTING, AND SHE WOULD NOT STOP CRYING. I MEAN, I TRIED EVERYTHING, AND SHE JUST WAS... ( mimicking crying ) AFTER 45 MINUTES OF THAT SHIT, I WAS LIKE, "WHAT IS YOUR FUCKING PROBLEM?! OLIVIA, SWEETHEART, IT'S JUST BABY. YOU CAN'T HANDLE BABY? LIFE IS GONNA KICK YOUR ASS." SHE WOULD NOT STOP CRYING, AND I SAID, "WANDA, STOP HOLLERING AT THE BABY. DON'T TALK TO HER LIKE THAT." AND I WAS LIKE, "OLIVIA, SWEETHEART, MOMMY IS SO SORRY, BUT LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I CAN'T HELP YOU. BUT I CAN HELP ME." SO I WENT OVER AND MADE A DRINK. I MADE MYSELF A NICE MARTINI. I WAS LIKE, "MM-HMM..." SHE WAS... ( mimicking crying ) I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW. BUT YOU GOTTA BAIL OUT THE BANKS, BABY, YOU JUST GOTTA DO IT." ( mimicking crying ) "I DON'T KNOW, I THINK THE REDSKINS ARE LOOKING GOOD. I DON'T KNOW." ( mimicking crying ) "OH WAIT, YOU SHOULD SEE MY 401(k). WHEW! AGH!" AND MY WIFE, SHE, YOU KNOW, SHE'S TRYING TO SET SOME RULES AROUND THE HOUSE, RIGHT? YEAH, SHE SAID THE BABIES, THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO WATCH TV. THE BABIES ARE THREE MONTHS OLD. HOW THE FUCK-- IT'S JUST COLORS TO THEM. THEY CAN'T-- THEY AIN'T WATCHING TV. YOU KNOW, BUT I'M SITTING THERE ONE DAY, I'M FEEDING OLIVIA. MY WIFE COMES THROUGH, TV'S ON, SHE COMES THROUGH, SHE PICKS UP THE REMOTE CONTROL, TURNS THE TV OFF-- "BABY, COME ON. TU NE PEUX PAS REGARDER LA TéLéVISION. NON." "WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CAN'T WATCH TV?! THE BABY'S NOT WATCHING TV. I'M WATCHING TV. TURN OFF MY TV? BUT SHE'S ALL, "BABY, TV IS NOT GOOD. IT'S NOT GOOD." I'M LIKE, "WAIT A MINUTE! TV PAID FOR THE TV. ( audience laughing, cheering ) I THINK TV IS PRETTY FUCKING GOOD. WE SHOULD HAVE ABOUT 50 TV's IN THIS MOTHERFUCKER." MY WIFE IS FRENCH. YOU KNOW, SHE'S FRENCH. I LIKE TO SAY SHE'S FRENCH BECAUSE IT SOUNDS NICER THAN WHITE. ( sighs ) WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S SO FUNNY, LIKE, AS AN INTERRACIAL COUPLE, IT'S FUNNY THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE-- WE HAVEN'T REALLY CAUGHT A LOT OF TROUBLE. THE ONLY GROUP THAT'S KINDA LIKE BEEN FUCKING WITH US-- STRAIGHT BLACK WOMEN. STRAIGHT BLACK WOMEN, THEY GIVE US GRIEF. AND I'M LIKE, "WHAT THE FUCK? YOU'RE STRAIGHT! WHAT THE HELL?! IT'S NOT LIKE YOU LOST ONE." STRAIGHT BLACK WOMEN, THEY STILL, YOU KNOW, MAKE EYES AND GIVE MY WIFE SHIT. I'M LIKE, "WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? WHAT, YOU'RE STRAIGHT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, GOING, 'MM, LOOK AT THEM WHITE GIRLS. JUST TAKING ALL OUR GOOD BLACK DYKES. JUST CAN'T KEEP A GOOD BLACK DYKE, I TELL YOU.'" ( chuckles ) ( sighs ) AND ALSO, OUR BABIES, OUR BABIES, THEY'RE WHITE. THEY'RE WHITE, YEAH. LITTLE WHITE BABIES, YOU KNOW. AND PEOPLE ASK ME, "WELL, WHY DON'T YOU USE A BLACK DONOR, YOU KNOW, SO THE BABIES COULD LOOK LIKE Y'ALL, YOU KNOW, LOOK LIKE YOU?" I'M LIKE, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN LOOK LIKE US? THE BABIES AIN'T GONNA LOOK LIKE US. WE'RE TWO WOMEN. WE AIN'T FOOLIN' NOBODY! ( audience laughing, applauding ) WHAT THE FUCK?" I WOULD SLAP THE SHIT OUT OF SOMEBODY IF THEY WALKED UP TO US AND POINTED AT ME AND WAS LIKE, "( clicks tongue ) YOU MUST BE THE DADDY." GET THAT DUMBASS OUTTA HERE. AND PLUS, YOU KNOW, WE TALKED ABOUT IT. WE TALKED ABOUT USING A BLACK DONOR, BUT, YOU KNOW, I HAD TO REALLY THINK THIS THING OUT. I HAD TO THINK IT OUT, AND I WAS LIKE, "HMM, I'M 10 YEARS OLDER THAN MY WIFE, SO YOU KNOW, MAYBE I'LL BE THE FIRST TO GO." THEN I THOUGHT-- I SAID, "AND WHAT IF WE HAVE A LITTLE GIRL, A LITTLE BIRACIAL GIRL?" I WAS LIKE, "I CAN'T LEAVE THAT GIRL'S HAIR UP TO THIS WHITE LADY. I CAN'T DO THAT TO HER! I COULDN'T-- I COULDN'T LEAVE MY BABY'S HAIR IN THIS WHITE LADY'S HANDS. SHE'D FUCK HER HAIR UP!" YOU EVER SEEN THEM BIRACIAL KIDS, AND THE WHITE MOTHER JUST HAS NO IDEA WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR HAIR, SO THEIR HAIR IS JUST ALL MATTED UP, NEVER BEEN COMBED AND LINT AND CAR KEYS AND Q-TIPS ALL IN THEIR SHIT? JUST-- JUST FIND A BLACK FRIEND, DO SOME-- TAKE THE CHILD TO A BLACK BEAUTY PARLOR, JUST FUCKING DRIVE THROUGH THE 'HOOD AND STICK HER HEAD OUT THE WINDOW. DO SOMETHING! ( chuckling ) SHIT. SO I LOVE MY LITTLE WHITE BABIES. I'M ALREADY HAVING FUN. I'M ALREADY HAVING FUN WITH THEM. I LIKE TO DO-- LIKE, WE GO TO BABIES"R"US OR SOMETHING. I ALWAYS HAVE MY BALL CAP ON AND MY DARK SHADES, YOU KNOW, AND I DRIFT OFF FROM MY WIFE AND THE BABIES. AND THEN WHEN I SEE PEOPLE LOOKING AT ME AND TRYING TO FIGURE SHIT OUT, I RUN OVER THERE, KNOCK MY WIFE OUT OF THE WAY, AND TAKE THE STROLLER. BOY, THEY LOOK THEM DOORS QUICK! ( sighs ) AND MY FRIENDS-- MY FRIENDS FUCK WITH ME ALL THE TIME. I LOVE IT, THOUGH, YOU KNOW. WE GOT THAT HONESTY WITH EACH OTHER. MY FRIENDS WERE LIKE, "DAMN, YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF FUNNY. YOU GOT... YOU GOT BABIES THAT IF THEY GET LOST, YOU CAN'T EVEN CLAIM 'EM." I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S FUCKED UP!" BUT YOU KNOW, SHE'S RIGHT! I THOUGHT ABOUT IT. I WAS LIKE, "SHIT. IF I EVER TAKE MY BABIES TO DISNEYLAND, I'M GONNA HAVE TO GIVE THEM A TALK, LIKE, 'LOOK, OKAY, LOOK. IT'S JUST US. NOW, YOU CAN GET LOST IF YOU WANT TO, BUT YOU GONNA BE THERE AWHILE." IF I'M AT DISNEYLAND, I'M GONNA HAVE TO FIND A NICE WHITE LADY. "EXCUSE ME, MA'AM. COULD YOU GO GET MY KIDS?" FUNNY, MAN. CHANGE. A LOT OF PHYSICAL CHANGES ARE GOING ON. YOU KNOW, I NEVER THINK ABOUT AGE, BUT JUST THINK THERE'S SOME CHANGES THAT HAPPEN TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE AGE PROCESS IS HAPPENING, YOU KNOW, LIKE, JUST LITTLE THINGS. LIKE, NOW WHEN I SAY I HAVE TO PEE, I MEAN I HAVE TO PEE. BEFORE, YOU KNOW, I USED TO CARRY EXTRA PANTIES IN MY PURSE IN CASE I GOT LUCKY. NOW I CARRY 'EM IN CASE I SNEEZE. WHAT THE HELL? ( chuckling ) NOW SOMEBODY JUST PEED ON THEMSELVES RIGHT NOW. I'M SAYING-- I JUST GOTTA GO. AND I EVEN ASKED MY DOCTOR ABOUT IT. I'M LIKE, "LOOK, WHAT IS GOING ON?" SHE SAID, "WELL, YOU NEED TO DO MORE KEGEL EXERCISE. YOU NEED TO EXERCISE YOUR KEGEL MUSCLE, DO THOSE EXERCISES, YOU KNOW, SQUEEZE IT, YOU KNOW, TIGHTEN UP. UGH, DO THAT." I WAS LIKE, "OKAY." I GOT HOME. I DID ABOUT 15 OF THEM AND CAUGHT A CHARLIE HORSE. I WAS LIKE, "OHH! ( groaning ) SWEET JESUS." IT WAS LIKE SOMEBODY HAD SHOT ME IN MY TWAT. I WAS LIKE... ( groaning ) I'M GONNA TELL YOU, YOU CAN'T PUT ICY HOT ON THAT. YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T. SHIT JUST HAPPENS, MAN.

LET GO OF THE WHEEL, ESTHER!" "I WANT SOME CHEESECAKE! SHIT!" "YOU'RE GONNA KILL US, ESTHER." AND I TRY TO MAKE DEALS WITH HER, YOU KNOW, I'M LIKE, "HEY, LOOK, ESTHER, WHENEVER I GOTTA BE ON CAMERA, I'M ON TV, RIGHT," I SAID, "I GOTTA PUT YOU ON THE SPANX. I GOTTA GET YOU IN THE SPANX." OH, SHE HATES THE SPANX. CAN'T STAND THE SPANX. ALL THOSE GUYS OUT THERE KNOW WHAT THE SPANX ARE. THEY'RE LIKE REALLY, REALLY TIGHT PANTYHOSE. THEY'RE SHORT, THEY COME ALL THE WAY UP HERE, BUT THEY SUCK EVERYTHING IN. I GOT ONE ON RIGHT NOW. THEY SUCK EVERYTHING IN. YEAH, I'M ON TV, SHIT, YEAH. ESTHER'S IN THE SPANX. FUCK YEAH!

'CAUSE LOOK, WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG WITH THAT DICK, THEY FIX IT IN A MINUTE. THEY GET THAT DICK BACK UP AND RUNNING. LADIES, WE'VE BEEN OUT HERE FOR DECADES DOING MARATHONS AND TRYING TO RAISE MONEY TO FIND A CURE FOR BREAST CANCER. A MAN HASN'T WALKED A MILE FOR HIS BALLS. ( audience laughing, cheering ) RIGHT? THEY DON'T HAVE TO. THEY JUST FIX IT. THEY JUST FIX IT. AND NOT ONLY DO THEY FIX IT, IT'S OVERKILL. IT IS. ANYTIME THEY HAVE TO GIVE YOU A WARNING-- "ERECTIONS MAY LAST UP TO SIX HOURS." SIX HOURS?!

I FEEL SORRY FOR ALL THESE LITTLE OLD LADIES OUT THERE WHO'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR LIKE 50, 60 YEARS, AND YOU KNOW THESE LAST TWO, THREE YEARS, ALL THEY'VE BEEN DOING IS JUST WAITING FOR THAT DICK TO BREAK, JUST WAITING. THEY'VE JUST BEEN WAITING FOR THAT DICK TO DIE. THEY'RE LIKE, "I KNOW, OKAY, THAT DICK, IT DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH LIFE IN IT. I KNOW THAT DICK... THAT SHOULD BE DEAD PRETTY SOON. THAT DICK WILL... THEN I CAN GO DO THINGS, DO THINGS I WANNA DO, GO ANTIQUING, AND TAKE MY LITTLE BUS TRIPS WITH MY LADY FRIENDS AND PLAY THE PENNY SLOTS FOR HOURS. I CAN-- I CAN CLEAN OUT THAT DRAWER IN MY NIGHTSTAND, GET ALL THOSE LUBES OUTTA THERE AND PUT IN MY CROSSWORD PUZZLES. I CAN'T WAIT. I CAN'T WAIT." AND ONE DAY, THEY GET THEIR WISH. HE TELLS HER, "BABY, I THINK THAT PART IS OVER." SHE COMFORTS HIM. "IT'S OKAY, SWEETHEART. THERE'S MORE TO US THAN THAT. WE HAVE A STRONG COMPANIONSHIP, LOVE. THAT'S NOT JUST WHO WE ARE. IT'S OKAY. I LOVE YOU. MWAH!" KISSES HIS LITTLE FOREHEAD, MAKES HIM FEEL BETTER ABOUT HIMSELF. AND AS SOON AS HE LEAVES THE HOUSE, SHE'S LIKE, "HALLELUJAH! THE DICK IS DEAD!" AND SHE DOES A LITTLE "DICK DON'T WORK NO MORE" DANCE. * THE DICK DON'T WORK NO MORE * * DICK DON'T WORK NO MORE * * DICK DON'T WORK NO MORE * * HALLELUJAH, DICK IS DEAD * * DICK IS DEAD, DICK IS DEAD * * DING DONG, THE DICK IS DEAD * * DICK IS DEAD, DICK IS DEAD * * DING DONG, THE DICK-- DICK IS DEAD * * HI HO, HI HO * THE DICK DON'T WORK NO MORE * ( whistles ) SHE IS LOVIN' IT!

THEY JUST HAVE A HOUSECOAT ON. THAT'S THE LADY WHO'S BEEN TRICKED BY SCIENCE. "BUT I SAW IT. THE DICK WAS DEAD. I SAW THAT DICK. THAT DICK WAS DEAD, LORD. I DON'T... WHY ME? WHY ME?" THAT'S WHO I FEEL SORRY FOR. SEE, THAT'S NOT RIGHT. IT SHOULD BE MUTUAL. SHE SHOULD HAVE SOME SAY, RIGHT? SO AT LEAST THEY SHOULD PUT AN AGE LIMIT ON IT, RIGHT? THEY SHOULD. LIKE IF YOU'RE OVER 78, THE DOCTOR SHOULDN'T GIVE YOU THAT PILL UNLESS YOU GOT A NOTE FROM THREE WOMEN WHO WANNA FUCK YOU. ( audience laughing, applauding ) ( chuckles ) SO... I CHANGED SOME THINGS. I TRIED, YOU KNOW, I TRIED TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS. I TRIED TO CHANGE SOME THINGS, YOU KNOW, LIKE I TRIED TO GET WAXED, YEAH. I TRIED WAXING FOR THE FIRST TIME, YEAH. MY FRIEND, SHE HAS A SPA SHE RUNS OUT OF HER HOUSE AND TO SUPPORT HER, I WAS LIKE, "OOH, I'M GONNA GET THE WHOLE SPA PACKAGE." YOU KNOW, AND PART OF IT WAS A BIKINI WAX. YEAH, SO I WAS LIKE, "OKAY, I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT. I'LL TRY IT," YOU KNOW. AND SHE TOLD ME, "WANDA, IT'S GONNA HURT A LITTLE BIT." I WAS LIKE, "I'M TOUGH. I GOT THAT SHIT." SO SHE PUT THE WAX ON THERE AND PUT THE TAPE ON THERE AND... ( imitates whooshing ) I SMACKED THE SHIT OUTTA HER. YOU HEAR ME? YOU HEAR ME? ( mimics whooshing ) "WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?! SHIT! IS THIS WHAT YOU DO? YOU JUST SIT UP IN YOUR HOUSE AND SNATCH HAIR OFF OF PEOPLE ALL DAY? THIS IS SOME SICK SHIT!" AND THEN SHE STARTS SMACKING IT. I'M LIKE, "OW! OW! OW! BITCH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!" SHE'S LIKE, "OH, THAT TAKES THE STING AWAY." I WAS LIKE, "NO, THAT FUCKING HURTS! HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF I STABBED YOU AND THEN STUCK MY FINGER IN THE HOLE? OOH! DON'T THAT FEEL BETTER? SOOTHING, HUH?" OOH, I WAS MAD. AND THEN I WAS MAD BECAUSE I HAD TO LET HER FINISH. YOU KNOW, I HAD TO LET HER-- GET HER TO EVEN THAT SHIT OUT. I COULDN'T HAVE ONE SIDE WAXED AND ONE SIDE RAZORED. THAT SHIT DON'T MATCH. IT WOULD HAVE FELT LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE WAS IN MY PANTS, YOU KNOW, LIKE... "MM. HOW YOU DOIN'?" WHOO, THAT HURT! BOY. AND THEN IT GOT WORSE. 'CAUSE I THOUGHT SHE WAS FINISHED, AND THEN SHE GOES, "OKAY, NOW TURN OVER." YEAH. I WAS LIKE, "EXCUSE ME?" SHE SAID, "TURN OVER. I GOTTA GET THE BACKSIDE. I GOTTA GET YOUR BUTT." I WAS LIKE, "MY BUTT? OH, THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY. NOTHING GOES ON BACK THERE. BESIDES, I LIKE IT TO LOOK LIKE THAT 'CAUSE IT SCARES PEOPLE AWAY. YOU KNOW, MAKE THEM THINK I GOT A DOG CHAINED UP BACK THERE OR SOMETHING. IF THEY GET CLOSE, I EVEN GROWL A LITTLE BIT. ( growls ) SHE WAS LIKE, "ROLL OVER, FOOL, COME ON." SHE WAS LIKE, "IT WON'T HURT THAT MUCH." I'M LIKE, "WELL, WHAT THE FUCK. ALL RIGHT. A LITTLE CHANGE. WHY NOT?" SO I TURN OVER, AND SHE PUT THE WAX IN THERE, PUT THE TAPE IN THERE... ( mimics whooshing ) EVERYTHING WENT WHITE. AND A LITTLE BIT OF PEE CAME OUT. A LITTLE BIT OF PEE CAME OUT, TOO. ( chuckles ) AND I PASSED OUT. BUT I WASN'T OUT LONG. I WASN'T OUT LONG. 'CAUSE WHEN I WOKE UP, SHE WAS STILL STANDING THERE HOLDING THE THING, AND SHE GOES, "ARE YOU OKAY, WANDA?" I WAS LIKE, "UH... I, UH... I THINK YOU JUST RIPPED OUT MY ASSHOLE. YEP, YOU HAVE RIPPED OUT MY ASSHOLE. WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? UH, DON'T THROW THAT ONE THERE. GIVE ME THAT BACK. I NEED THAT ONE BACK." SOME SICK SHIT! I NEVER FELT PAIN LIKE THAT BEFORE. THAT KIND OF PAIN SHOULD HAPPEN OUT IN THE WILD SOMEWHERE. I'M SAYING IT SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING TO HUMANS. YOU KNOW, YOU WATCH THOSE NATURE SHOWS, AND YOU SEE THE LION STALKING THE WILDEBEEST, AND WHEN HE MAKES THAT INITIAL BITE, IT LOOKS SO PAINFUL-- THAT'S WHAT IT FELT LIKE. I PICTURED MY ASSHOLE RUNNING ACROSS THE SERENGETI. I WAS LIKE, "RUN, ASSHOLE! RUN, ASSHOLE, RUN! COME ON, ASSHOLE! COME ON, ASSHOLE! AGH!" HOT LION TEETH IN MY ASSHOLE. THAT'S WHAT IT FELT LIKE. SHIT, I GOT A TETANUS SHOT WHEN I LEFT THERE, I'M TELLING YOU. SO I'M GETTING MY STUFF TOGETHER, YOU KNOW, GETTING READY TO LEAVE, AND I'M GETTING DRESSED, AND SHE GOES, "WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE NOT FINISHED." I'M LIKE, "WHAT?" AND SHE GOES, "UH, I HAVE TO DO YOUR FACIAL." I WAS LIKE, "MY FACIAL? NOT AFTER YOU'VE BEEN DIGGING AROUND IN MY ASS! I DON'T WANT YOUR ASS-Y HANDS TOUCHING MY FACE! YOU DON'T GO ASS TO FACE. YOU GO CLEAN TO DIRTY." ( audience laughing, cheering ) YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES AS MUCH AS YOU TRY TO FIGHT THE WHOLE CHANGE AND AGING PROCESS, SOMETIMES THINGS HAPPEN THAT ARE JUST SO STRONG IN YOUR FACE, JUST SMACKS YOU DEAD IN YOUR FACE THAT YOU JUST HAVE TO GO, "OKAY, IT IS WHAT IT IS." THIS IS A TRUE STORY. I'M COMING OUT OF THE MALL-- RIGHT, WALKING OUT OF THE MALL, AND I'M JUST DIGGING THROUGH MY PURSE, JUST RIFLING THROUGH MY BAG, AND YOU KNOW, I'M TALKING TO MY FRIEND, AND SHE COULD TELL THAT I WAS DISTRACTED. SHE'S LIKE, "WANDA, ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?" I WAS LIKE, "GIRL, I'M SORRY, BUT ( clicks tongue ) I THINK I LEFT MY CELL PHONE IN THE STORE." THEN SHE GOES, "OKAY WELL, CALL ME BACK WHEN YOU FIND IT." MAN. THANK YOU, D.C.! I LOVE YOU ALL! ( audience cheering ) ( R&B music playing ) * HO * HO * I'MA BE ME * YEAH * I'MA BE ME * YEAH * I'MA BE ME * YEAH * OH YEAH * I'MA BE ME * YEAH * THINKIN' 'BOUT THE CHANGES IN MY LIFE * * EVERYTHING IS FINALLY FEELING RIGHT * * CHANGE IS COMING FOR YOU * * CHANGE IS COMING FOR YOU * * OH OH OH * CHANGE IS COMING FOR YOU * * OH YEAH * CHANGE IS COMING FOR YOU * * I'MA BE ME WHOO!
