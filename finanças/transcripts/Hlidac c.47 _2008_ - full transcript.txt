The cannon nearly glowed as he tamped in the load... Ore Mountains, Czechoslovakia 1920 And the blow came quick... Cut the war crap. My father's a cripple. -Where from? -Galicia. He lost both legs. The cannon nearly glowed, loading, loading. -The cannon nearly glowed... -Where to now? -Up the hill! -Whoa! Where now? -Up to the castle. -Up to the guardhouse? - I said castle. Drivel -No, I won't strain the horses. -Should we carry our belongings? I said I'm not going. I'll unload you at the pub. -Are you taking us or not? -No! Go sit in the pub. We'll go on without you. -The horses won't take you. -They will. -I'd like to see that. -Just watch. Move! You'll see how we rode in the war. Madman... Czech Television presents the film GUARD NO. 47 Starring Based on the novel by Josef Kopta Written by I'm glad you're here. There are more and more trains. People are afraid to cross. The name's Flasar. -I've got a farm nearby. -Dousa. Josef Dousa. Good luck. Don't worry, we'll be fine here. Directed by -Yes. -47, Dousa. Understood... Bayonets on! Out! Out! -Move! -Forward! What are you doing? Get off the tracks! Go on, get out of here! Get off the tracks! Get out of here! Get off the tracks! -No! -Get up! Get up! -No! -Get off the tracks! -I want to die! What the hell? Are you crazy? Idiot! Stop it! Are you crazy? Huh? Come inside! I'm Anna, Anna Dousova. What's your name? I'm Ferda, the local gravedigger. Ferda, you were tempting fate. Don't you know what it's like to be alone with no family? I'll make you some hot tea. Terezka left me. She always pulled away... in disgust. Afraid of a gravedigger, you wretch? I nauseate you, don't I? She's afraid of people. We've been here a week without any visitors. Oh, no. Even beasts sense who I am. Gravediggers are indispensable. We'll all need one someday. Don't tell anyone about me. I wasn't here. Promise? Why would you lie on the tracks? What could such a young man lack? I lack what you deprived me of: death. I'll be going. -Won't you finish your tea? -No, thank you. Thanks for everything. Maybe now the worst is over. He's an idiot. Josef? Josef, what are you thinking about now? The tracks... I saw her there again. Josef, you promised me. I can't stop thinking about her. Josef... Frantiska! It was my fault. I should have crippled myself rather than enlist. We shouldn't have taken this place. You'll keep thinking about her; you'll always see her on the tracks. The only job veterans can ever get is as a guard. Don't think about the dead. You're a murderer, Dousa! You killed my sister! What? -Brutal murderer! -Murderer? You ran away to war so you wouldn't have to marry her! -Murderer? -Murderer! Why am I a murderer? I didn't want her to kill herself. You killed my sister! Why are you doing this, Anicka? Why? -Filthy murderer! -Josef... -Don't say that. -Wake up! Murderer! -I didn't say anything. -You didn't? -No. Stop thinking about Frantiska. We're the only ones here. Sorry, Anicka... I don't feel well. -Who is that? -Greetings. -Who is that? -The one from the guardhouse. -Good day, Mrs. Dousova. -Good day. -Greetings. -Greetings. Ah, you've come today too. Maybe we should toll the bell. -Greetings, Mr. Mayor. -Greetings. Dear God, our Father, forgive me my sins. Forgive me my thoughts. Forgive that I care for Josef and that I wanted Frantiska gone. The body of Christ... The body of Christ... Dear God, please let Josef and me have the happiness... The body of Christ... ...that a man and woman only experience in holy matrimony. And let me love Josef. Amen. The body of Christ... PUB Good day. Good day... The name's Dousa, guard 47. Cejka, the mayor. Good day. The name's Kubena, the butcher. -Maranek. -Dousa. -Welcome, Dousa. -We already know each other, eh? Treat him well so he'll dig you a good grave. -I'm not planning on dying today. -This is Fahoun, the coffin maker. -Fahoun. They call me Coffin. -Dousa. What do you like to sing? Are there any veterans here? -Aren't you a vet, Maranek? -Not even you? Not likely! Barkeep, another round for everyone, on me. Right away. Balls flying past their ears, the cannonade grew fierce. And they stood their ground, the muskets mowed them down. The cannon nearly glowed, loading, loading, loading... Where're you going, Ferda? The cannon nearly glowed, loading, loading, loading. The cannon nearly glowed as he tamped in the load... Going to see her? I saw how you couldn't keep your eyes off her. A pretty woman, eh? Do you like her? Creep away, you church rat. The Lord sees everything. Even inside of you. And so do I... Watch out for the gravedigger. He's young and your wife is pretty. You don't know my wife. She can handle anyone, acolyte. Be careful... A train is coming. -Why are you here, Ferda? -To see you. But you can't; what would my husband say? Are you afraid because I'm a gravedigger? -Do I smell like death? -No. Won't you invite me in? I'm freezing. I won't do anything to you. Do you think I'm a thief or a murderer? People treat stray dogs better than me. Okay, come have some tea. You should marry. Find a nice girl, build a house, have children... -Just don't stay alone. -Yeah... That's easy to say. But I've already found her. Weill Don't hesitate or someone else will... Don't say you don't know who it is. I went mad the first moment I saw you. I can't sleep, I'm lost, I feel alive for the first time in my life! I think only of you. I see you every second of every day! Let me go. Let me go... Anicka! We'll be together for just a moment. No one will know anything. -Anicka, come... -Let me go or I'll kill you. -Let me go. -Anicka! Let me go or I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Get out of here. Out! Be happy I don't tell my husband. He'd take care of things. Anicka! -Anicka, you're not asleep. -No. I think they're good people: Flasar, Bartik... And that coffin maker Fahoun is a good guy. I like him... The 06! Sorry I stayed so late but we talked everything over, discussed it all. We reminisced about the war... Are you angry? No, not at all. -I'd like to live out my days among friends. -Josef... -Anicka! -If there was even one unfriendly person here I'd take care of him. Wait, wait... Anicka, sorry. I'm hungry. The poor pub owner: TB finally got him. Lord Jesus Christ, Thy presence sanctifies all. Thou sanctified the grave in which Thou rested, and from which Thou also rose. Through Thee, blessed are the graves of all believers for they have died with Thee and so shall they rise. Remember what I told you, Ferda. Anicka? Come here. Come on! Where were you so long? After the funeral I talked to Mrs. Flasarova and Marankova... Come here... -You look nice. -Sorry, Josef... Not now. No, not now! I'm going in to cook. I'm going to cook. Guard 47... Yes... Yes. Roger! Got a cigarette? It was my fault. Get a stretcher! Come here. Don't worry... Josef... You'll forget one day. Sleep. Relax and sleep. Here you go... The afternoon train is coming soon. He has to put down the crossing bars. Then he has to meet the train, and that takes time, right? Anicka... I can't stop thinking about you. I see you always. It was nothing, understand? Nothing. We'll make it. -I don't want to. -He has to meet the train. -He won't come here. -I don't want to. -Anicka... -I don't want to. I can't. Leave me alone! No! -Why not? -Anicka! -No, I can't... -Is something wrong? If you say anything I'll deny it all. You won't get rid of me. Ever. Anicka! Anicka! -Anicka, what happened? -Nothing. -Are you all right? If he comes here again 'I kill him. I'll kill you! I'll Kill you, you hear? Anicka... I never would've believed you had the strength to defend yourself. I'm glad to have such a wife. Come here... Come here to me. Do you love me? Do you love me? Life will have meaning again as soon as we have a son. -What if it's a girl? -It'll be a boy. I know it. It's got to be a boy. Excellent, excellent, Anicka. Push hard, push... Excellent, excellent. -You're wonderful. -Why now? Why the death knell? One leaves, another arrives. God has arranged things well. Push, push, it's coming! Push, Anicka! Push, it's coming... Head, arms... Praise the Lord, praise the Lord. Mr. Dousa, your child is born, come here! She blossomed like a flower, a beautiful little girl. You were right, now life will have meaning. You'll love her, won't you? Yes... Of course I will. I've got to go. The 07 is coming. Go on, Dousa, go on! Don't get too drunk. What joy! Whoa! Greetings, Dousa. What are you doing outside? You'll freeze to death. -What's the matter with you? -I have a daughter. Come by this evening and we'll drink to her. You can't bury the truth. Maybe you don't even know it. Mrs. Dousova gave birth. She has a daughter. Why are you telling me? I thought you might be interested. Stop, stop! -You again? I said I'd kill you. -Let me go. -What're you doing here? Talk! -Let me go! Let me go! -Talk! What're you doing here! -Let me go! She's my wife, understand? Mine, mine! Come around again and I'll kill you! I'll Kill you, understand? I'll kill you! I'll kill you... I'll kill you! I'll Kill you! I didn't do anything, I swear! I didn't do anything, Mr. Dousa! Honest! Nothing, nothing! Josef! What are you doing? What are you doing? -What's wrong? -I'm Josef Dousa, guard 47! I'm Josef Dousa, guard 47! I know that. Why are you telling me? I'm Josef Dousa, guard 47! I can't hear. Anicka, I can't hear anything. I can't hear. I can't hear anything. -I can't hear anything. -It'll be okay. -Aren't you cold, kids? -No. Good day! Josef, a train: the 06... Guardhouse 47, Dousa. Roger! -The 06... -The 06. Bread from the Cejkas, milk from Mr. Maranek, and beef from Mr. Kubena. Well, here... Don't worry, if they call from the station I'll think of something. Be back for the 08. Josef, buy butter too. Josef! It was so long ago. It was so long ago! Is he deaf? Honk at him. They've got a cripple at home! Why must you punish them? Why? FOR SALE PUB You have a pretty wife And she's pretty handy, you deaf post. Look after my daughter for me, you gimp. Oh, good day, Mr. Dousa. How about a swig? Go ahead... You saved my life. Let's get smashed. Let's celebrate, okay? Hey, everybody, come on! It's closed but let's get smashed anyway! Here's to your health, Mr. Dousa. And thanks for saving me. Thank you, thank you, thank you... Go ahead, drink, take a swig, drink, drink! He's deaf, not stupid. You're the stupid one. I'll dig your grave for that. I'll dig your grave for that! I'll dig all your graves! I'll bury you all one day! Bastard. Up you go... Forget about the guardhouse, Mr. Dousa. Take over the pub so we'll have a place to drink. I'm here for bread, milk, meat... And I have to be back for the 08 at 15:30. -They'll fire you anyway. -A deaf barkeep... Better if he was blind, then we could skip paying! Hey, just stick to your stupid cows. -What's going on? Come here! - got it! -Gimme that, you scamp! -Give that back! -Can't catch me! Can't catch me! -Come here! -Here I am! -Lemme go! -Beat it! I've got it... Mr. Dousa, here you go. God, our Father... Don't allow me to be a laughingstock. Yes, Frantiska is on my conscience, but haven't I saved the lives of others? Haven't I redeemed my guilt enough? Merciful God, please... Don't punish me more than Thou punish others, and enable me to bear Thy punishment. Amen. -Josef, what happened? Get up. -Leave me alone. -Come on, get up. -Don't touch me. -Get up. -Leave me alone. I'm not worth your compassion! If that kid hadn't come around, I wouldn't have chased him, and I wouldn't have gotten angry and I wouldn't be deaf! -Come inside... -It's your fault. -Fine... I can't hear because of you. -It's your fault! -You drove my sister insane. -Is it my turn now? -It's your fault! She killed herself because of you! You've ruined my life. You think I like living here in the middle of nowhere? No! No! I even had to wait for years for a child... Leave me alone. Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! Don't worry, Josef. Come, you'll be with me soon. Just close your eyes, lean your head back... Come... I... I can hear. Anicka, I can hear. Watch out for the gravedigger. He's young and your wife is pretty. I won't tell her a thing. I'll find out more being deaf. Warm up your own food. I'm going to see Mrs. Flasarova. Here's a letter. Read it, it's from the railway. Read it. They want to throw us out of here. A deaf guard can't guard anything. Josef, if there was even one unfriendly person here I'd take care of him... No, I have to tell her. Anicka cares for me. Everything will be like it was. Like it was. If you knew how things were you wouldn't believe it. I'll be laughing at you... I'll cook for you but my life will be my own. You'll be on military disability after they examine you in Prague. Disability. And then we'll see. Maybe we'll take over the pub... from the dead owner. -Josef! -We're here, Dousa. Your documents... Don't lose them. Have a safe trip, Josef. Dousa! Josef Dousal Are you Dousa? Josef Dousa? -Dousa! -Please come with me. Dousa... Yes, yes... How old are you, Mr. Dousa? I served in Galicia. Dousa, Josef. Fine, fine... He doesn't make a bad impression, eh? -Yes, a good old soldier. -Not so fast, my dear colleague. Soldiers are sly. Such as him learned to cheat even death. Swindlers are well-schooled. He endured artillery fire and a powder house explosion. And he lost his hearing after a mine explosion. I'd put Mr. Dousa to the test. Test? What do you mean, chairman? As you know, sir, a deaf person can't stand on one leg because his sense of balance is markedly impaired. You won't get me like this, gentlemen. STAND ON YOUR RIGHT LEG Must it be my right? My right leg is shorter. Take your pick. Well, that's that. I'm satisfied, gentlemen. I've examined 20 deaf men in my time. Eleven were faking it and I caught them with this trick: I told them that nonsense about the sense of balance. They fell like pears; you should have seen him chase them out. But we can put Mr. Dousa on disability... without the least doubt. Here... You may go. -Is this place free? -Yes. -Thank you. That was the last time, Josef. Anyone could betray you. You can't hear anyone, no one. Thank you... Tickets please. Hello, sir? May I see your ticket? Or perhaps you don't have one? Sorry, I have problems with my hearing from the war. No problem... comrade. -Things will be better, you'll see. -Farewell, Mrs. Dousova. You look very pretty, like a Madonna and Child. Stop by the pub whenever you get sad up here. I'll do that. If you knew how things were you wouldn't believe it. What did she mean? The Lord could not have given me such a punishment. Are you comfortable? -Are you comfortable? -Fine. I hope we haven't forgotten anything. -REGIMENT PUB -Hold that. -Long live the new owner! -We'll help you, Dousa. -The first round's on me. -Good idea. -I'll get the chairs and we'll go. -Thank you. -Careful. -Look at that, he's a natural. -Beer! -Higher so he can see you. -Beer, Dousa. -Josef... “Two! -Right away. -Check please... Check! -He wants his check. That's four beers, two goulashes, and one kummel. -Two. I had one as well. -Sshh, he doesn't have to know. -He's as deaf as a post. -14.60. I wish you success, Mr. Dousa. Goodbye. Farewell. Little Zofie... Evening, gentlemen. Well, how's it going for the deaf post? He's doing better than you are with women. -Hi, Ferda. -Hi, Coffin. Thank you, ma'am. Well, ma'am, won't you serve me? My husband does drinks, I do food. -What are you hungry for? -I'm always very hungry. Beer! You never let up, you guttersnipe. -Dousa, beer! -Coming right up. -Beer! -Coming right up. -Kummel! -Here you are... -You look very nice, ma'am. -Enjoy it. -If I weren't a servant of God... -perhaps I'd be a sinner too. -You shouldn't drink so much. It's from Ferda... I can't stop thinking about you. Tomorrow at mass. Ferda. Ten! -I'd like to know who he robbed. -Yeah, to buy this pub. Maybe his old lady is making some extra on the side. Everyone at the railway steals; why not Dousa? -After all, he was a guard, right? -Just play... Everyone grabs something; why not Dousa? You oafs are talking about yourselves. How that deaf post looks at me... -We know everything. -I'd like to see his daughter. They say she looks like Ferda. Eh, Ferda? Anicka wouldn't do that to me- make me a laughingstock. Watch out for the gravedigger. He's young and your wife is pretty. She looks like Ferda... She looks like Ferda... God, where is everyone? Where is everyone? Who are you? What do you want? Just to wash my hands. No one invited you. Quiet, quiet... Who are you anyway? Me? I am your fate, Dousa. I'll be here far longer than you. You'll be long dead and I'll be here loafing about in your name. Idiot... Fighting, always fighting. Your whole life you never listened to reason. Do you think you can kill your own fate? -Josef, what's wrong? -Make him leave. -Who? -Make him leave! Dear old Vrchota was slow but not crazy. Josef, who? Come, Josef... Come on... Whoa! -Good day. -We're here, sir. -Take five to the cellar. -Good day. -Five. -Five, eh? Little Zofie... Josef, the little one is coughing. I'm going to get some drops. Go look after her. I'll be back soon. -Thank you, sir. -Thanks. Come on up here... You're the only one who loves me. Lord, don't punish me for the sins my body demands. My desire is stronger than the promise I made to my husband. Please, Father, don't stop loving Josef, my daughter Zofie, nor even me. Amen. -Page 32, ma'am. -Thank you. "I'm waiting in the belfry. F" Ferda? Ferda? I'm glad you accepted the invitation... Even though you didn't expect me. You're trembling. -I'll lend you my coat. -No, I'm fine. Do you feel my hands? So shall I tell your husband everything? What a spectacle it is to see the living romp near the dead. I can hold my tongue. - I see you again and again... -No! ...your bare arms, your lovely lap... -Leave me alone! -I hear your breath, - I sense your body... -Let me go! I won't hurt you, I won't hurt you! I can be gentle. You can redeem your sin, purify yourself before God. I did nothing. I know of no sin. You can lie to me but not to Him! He sees all. He knows we are mere mortals who submit to temptation. He will forgive you! He will forgive you! He will forgive even me, He will forgive everyone! Bastard! Get out of here! I didn't want to hurt her. -I just wanted what you had. -On your knees! No violence please. You should've thought about that before. Bastard! I'll kill you! I'll Kill you! You rat! I have the right to experience what others do. We never should have met, Ferda. I love you. Do you have the drops? She doesn't look sick. I had to wait for them to be mixed. And were you lying on your back in the meantime? I fell. What's that on your neck? Did you scratch yourself? -Give her to me. -Don't touch her! Don't touch her. -Give her to me. -And what about your breasts? -Give her to me! -Did he scratch your breasts? And what about your knees? Show me your knees. Show me! I want to see everywhere he scratched you. Show me! -Leave me alone! Give her to me! -Don't touch her! What about the child? Huh? Whose is Zofie? -Whose is Zofie? -Even your eyes have changed. -Go away. -Give her to me. -Go away. -Give her to me. You better beat it. I'll tell you what you are. Loud and clear. We're closed. Don't pretend not to understand. Look and read my lips: You're a bastard. Bastard! Go on, get out of here! You're a wimp, Dousa. A coward. You're afraid to hear the truth. She doesn't love you. Understand? She doesn't love you! Are you here again? I told you to leave. You ruined her life. Your wife's life. She hates you for it. She hates you. I'm really sorry, but we're closed. Please leave. All you do in bed is snore, old man. She'd have no fun without me. Want to know where we did it? In the charnel house, behind the church... It was beautiful. Anicka smells sweet. So sweet... Deaf post, you don't even know how excited your wife can get. She made a man of me. A man, you say? Then talk. -Go ahead, I'm listening. -How can you hear? Come here! -No! No! -You gravedigger scum! I should've let the train run you over! What about my wife, huh? Well, what about her? What did you do with her, you scum? What about my wife? Go on, talk! Cat got your tongue? What about my wife? What did you do with her? -Talk! -I didn't know you could hear! -Talk... I'm listening! -None of it's true! Not even in the war did I meet such a sneaking bastard as you. Please, no more. Scum! Josef? Josef? My God, Josef! Josef! -Jesus! -Anicka... -Anicka... -Yes? I just want to wash my hands. I just want to wash my hands. Josef... Anicka... Please don't be mad at me. You don't be mad, Josef. Forgive me... No! Forgive me, Josef... Give him rest, Lord, and may eternal light shine upon him... Subtitled by John Brent
