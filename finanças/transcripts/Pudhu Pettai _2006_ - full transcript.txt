Were we born with drugs smeared head to toe? Even I had a mother I asked her 1 question When my father has gone out why do you make out with the tailor? She poured hot water straight from the stove all over me I was totally scalded I was in the hospital for 2 months Today she is coming and asking me for money I said, 'Get lost, you itch with a B in front!' Everyone here has a story, Kumar Ask Jeeva his story It is truly funny Is my life a joke to you? Your story is interesting Go ahead, share it Let Kumar hear it Why do you hassle me like this? My father was a lorry driver He went somewhere, got AIDS gave it to my mother and conked off 'She suffered a lot' 'My sister and I took care of her by doing some menial jobs' 'One day, she committed suicide by self immolation' 'Praise be to Lord Ganesha' Thank you Don't you want me to do anything for you this time too? If you are scared let me know I can- No Why? You work your butt out every month Why do you give it to me? Can I leave? Do you have some other job to attend to? Did you enquire properly? Why are you tense, bro? They are all busy with their own stuff No one is around now This is confirmed news Why does our boss conduct meetings in only Murthy bro's area? Sticking these posters is a painful job We should show our power only in their area When they see our poster in morning, they will die Is that Murthy? Yes, bro Anna...anna I asked if you had enquired properly What can I do? His program must have changed 'Murthy M.L.A., Ruling party' Only 5 of them We can always finish them off If Murthy is somewhere in this area... ...there are at least 100 thugs around him He can kill 10 men single-handed for sure And if he's watching us paste posters in his area now- Hey! Stop it What to do now? Start the car Run over anyone who blocks our way Boys, run as fast as you can Hold on Run to the left Grab them Look at this useless henchman Drive slowly Turn and wait Don't stop They are sticking posters in our area, bro Some of them escaped in their car Our boys have gone in search of the rest We got hold of only this chap Who is that? Looks like a pencil He is one of the underdogs We didn't get any of the biggies Kill and throw his body in the market Let them know the repercussions of sticking posters in our area Did you take your medicine? Coughing all the time And your dream is to become a hero! For the sin of being your brother I'm forced to produce a film for you! Wait and watch what a roaring success I'll be Remove your damn coolers and go Oh yes! And you'll dye your hair They are playing a cat and mouse game They will take their own sweet time to kill him As if their memory is short to what we did to their goon Delhi, Anbu here We came here to stick posters in Murthy's area We are in a soup Can you send some boys here? More than 100 goons here Shall I let go? That seems right too Okay Let's go Come on Bro, Kumar That's all It's his fate Let us at least see what they do to him, bro You think we should? That seems right too As if we won't get hold of his boys someday - Enough, huh? - No, bro Don't you remember the way they murdered our Krishna? Don't keep comparing I'm panting Finish him off Hit him elsewhere Why are you dilly dallying? Isn't it getting late? Bro, almost over Let go of him He is on his feet Not bad, bro He is still able to move Move aside It's getting late Bro will lose his patience Come on, I say Hit me Hit me if you consider yourself a man You want to hit me? Go on Bash me up How long can you hit? I don't feel the pain Not even an ounce of pain Hit me, you sissies I am burning inside I'll kill all of you I can't believe this I swear, Delhi I saw him Just a punch Like this The sound still rings in my ears His ribs are broken it seems Only him Singlehanded Like a lion 100 men around him Murthy was also there You know Murthy's track record We are the talk of the town They are searching for us with a frenzy The thug who died is quite topnotch It will take a while for things to cool down He is safe only at your place Why don't you sit at the table and eat? He's still in a frenzy Kumar Your friends are here to visit you Let's go, sister Sister...? You carry on I'll be with you Cigarette No, forget it Not in the mood Don't interrupt when he is talking If you keep talking- What is the final conclusion? You know all of us inside out, bro If you bring in novices who have killed only once... ...it will be a major hassle We have a respect to maintain Send him on an assignment We will see how he performs Don't be scared of this test We should know your ability Never lock your bike on the side You can't getaway in an emergency Come, we need to walk a little distance from here You isn't a big job Just chop a man's hand Right hand Note it down Okay anna Come That's the house He will come to this house at 10:00 p.m And leave by 1:00 a.m She is his mistress Look, that's his car He has to walk this distance to get into his car That's why we are standing here Understood? Look if he is inside If you look for so long... ...kaput You should peep a little bit and then pull away All you'll get is 1 second Note down everything within that span Is that clear? Now look What did you see? There is no one there What else did you see? Why do you stress me out? There is man walking on the street A female is looking out from her balcony 2-3 kids are playing hide and seek 2 dogs are roaming around 3 houses have their doors open Take a look I was right? Eye should capture everything like a camera Not miss a single detail Here, take this Your weapon Keep it safe at home invoking God's blessings! Hold it Your hands are shivering Hold it steady Keep it like this It shouldn't be seen And easy to handle Take it out Shove it in Do it once more Shove it in Not bad Only 5 minutes left He will be here any time Be alert Keep your hands on your hip Are you scared? No Don't lie Aren't you scared? Even I'm scared It isn't wrong Fear will protect you Only when we fear our life we can take another life He is coming Don't even breathe Keep your hand on the knife Go Go, man Go, I say You would have got me killed too I am stuck with you Get up It's okay This is how it will be the first time Don't get tense I've chopped half You chop the rest Only then you will understand GO Let's go Don't worry I'll certify you well "To one side of the mouth, fire flickers" "In both eyes however, a knife glitters" "The stride of a man is a give-away The whole town will at once give way" "What is this, oh God? I have no clue, my lord!" "Uprooted trees surround Jungle razed to the ground" "Spying neighbor Road-side informer" "At the market stares daggers Dying to kill me, follows orders" Whatever happens never express your fear "He follows me like a puppy Like Lord Yama, he tails me" "Many faces, different sides When our eyes meet, he hides" This is your problem, Kumar You killed Murthy's brother So they are after you If we come in between then it will become a gang war "Will he make the 1st move? Or will I attack to prove?" "If tomorrow night, dude" "...he comes, I'll tell you" "Clouds burst and break into rain indeed A ball when kicked quickens its speed" "What is this, oh God-" Hey, no Stay like that He's twirling his weapon so fast! Chop his head Chop his head Aim for his head Come on I say Saroja, is Krishnaveni there? She has gone with a customer to Mahabalipuram She will be back tomorrow Is it urgent? Can I send someone else?

I want to see you I'll come tomorrow morning Okay, see you I'll call you later Don't imagine the worst and get tense I'll see you tomorrow Bro, for my sake That brothel survives thanks to her Krishnaveni is the main attraction How can she be spared? Poor thing, bro She is not interested As if we do our job with great interest It's our profession Kumar, you are unaware of behind the scene activities We have rules to follow I won't ask whom you intend killing They same way don't ask me to spare this girl You shouldn't even be asking me in the first place I was the one who took you there Don't talk without knowing the history behind it Why this deviation? You are doing well for yourself Everyone is raving about you Why trespass into unwanted space? If you want take her out for 2 days Be happy Instead you are trying to reform people! No, bro Poor girl Leave her Are you threatening me? You are not talking Your desire for her is talking Because you enjoyed what she offered you You are blinded What did she say? Did she say you are a big shot and we will be frightened of you? Your are a toddler! How much I would have seen? Just because I know you I'm trying to be patient Go I've been there Felt all this - Bro? - Then what? Does he really know me? From tomorrow she won't come to work Put it back You don't need that to kill him Take him away Thinks he is royalty to order us around Do a good job of polishing it Not the same place Why are you glaring at me? I'm telling you and you are still glaring at me Bro, listen to me Don't get tense He is a novice Let him go Go and don't act stupid If our boss hears about this it will become an issue Let's go, anna What the hell? Are you sending a messenger? Looks like both brother and sister have forgotten your past I'll chop you You don't need me anymore? Are you fed up with it? That bloody mongrel is defending you to me You lured him, huh? Is he the knight in shining armor? You should be like this for a week now Saroja, lock her up and starve her till I tell you Did she ask you to defend her? She was leading her own life He will kill her He has ordered his goons to kill you too They are looking for you Go hide somewhere for a week We will try and plead for your life If you stay here he will kill you Clear out You should know your place Not think you are Lord of all you survey! Can't get into the bad books of Anbu, Kumar The message will reach our boss Find some other place to stay How is the gravy? Your mother prepared it I searched for you everywhere You ran away that day though I kept calling you My boys came and told me You had joined Delhi's gang and become quite notorious I just couldn't believe it I was so happy I threw a party for the boys and tipped them 1000 bucks each Why do you feel shy? He is your brother Come and serve Look at her feeling shy Don't worry, Kumar You can stay here for as long as you want We aren't as big as you Still no one can sneak into our area without my knowledge How much do they pay you? Tell me only if you want to Around 30 to 40000 God exists, Kumar You were worried we were suffering My son has come back to save us For the past 6months, no proper income I'm living on borrowed money I'm not even sending them to school I didn't have an option but to picked pocket yesterday I was totally disgraced, Kumar What? Keep it in, Kumar Why are you suddenly taking out your money? Now we are all one family Just felt like sharing it with my son, I did so Do something 'A few days later' Behave properly, Kumar I've told Anbu bro everything He is in a good mood today Don't get me wrong How could you rub our boss the wrong way? Don't be scared We are here with you The girl looked up to me like I was her hero In that temerity I lost my cool Forgive this dog, bro Ask your thugs not to kill me You are everything to me, bro Bro, don't, please Ask these boys I'll praise you sky high daily to them He is such a fast learner He will reach greater heights within 5 to 6 years How dare you talk to me like that? What did you lack? I looked after you like my son, didn't I? Bro...! Why fall at me feet after being so audacious? Decision once made can't be changed Get up Don't kill me Think yourself to be a rowdy? How much did they pay you? Who sent you? Did you come here to kill Anbu? Sir, don't Don't get tense Anbu is dead Can't you see? Who will look after that locality? At the beginning of every month he will give me 10 million bucks He will place it at my feet and get my blessing He worked like a dog for 30 years Why did you bring him here? Why didn't you dissect him and throw him into the Cooum? Son of a mongrel I spoke to him 2 nights ago Told him the elections are nearing He asked me not to worry and promised to arrange for 50 million Such an unfair untimely death What to do with him? Erect a statue in the beach Okay? Go Get lost! He has set a bad example Others will follow Will it turn out well? Hey Delhi If we spare him, will he be of any use to us? If you spare my life, then I'll let you go Are you acting over-smart? Can't you see our men around? If you create a scene I'll show you my prowess Then what is the use of your boys chasing me? What? Did you have this knife hidden and let me beat you? What if you had killed me in anger? I was almost tempted But you might be of some use in the future Hey, what's your age now? Hey Ram Times have changed They are growing up so fast What do you know about Anbu? He was in politics for the past 30 years Do you know there is a big gang behind him?

Not angry with me? 1 minute Go Here, I can only give this That too not for you For the sake of my leader Don't know what is happening A greenhorn is seated with crossed legs and dictating terms You are silently watching He will tell us it seems How much we should supply in each area And we should obey I believe I can't be treated like crap What will he do if I don't give? What will you do? I'm asking you directly Will you finish me off? You're going overboard Oh my God!

Why are you lamenting like this? Mani, why can't I marry your sister? In what way am I inferior to the groom you chose? Who is he? After all that dog works for pittance in some random office We begged him for a year just for 1 sovereign of gold She will get new clothes for only Diwali and Pongal Do you want her to suffer in poverty all her life? I can't watch her suffer Don't you know about me? Don't you know how well I'll look after your sister? You mother can cry Your father can cry But can you cry? I'm sad I'm very sad You have known me for so long And you are letting me down I'm ashamed To be honest, what should you have done? You should have garlanded me Got me new clothes and escorted me with respect What kind of a friend are you? Go and do whatever you need to do Make arrangements for our wedding night Sir, go get the flowers, fruits and the necessary paraphernalia My dear lady please go You will kill me with your tears! Please go Go, Mani Won't I feel like getting married? Understand my view point You're such a big shot and you don't know to wear a 'dhoti'? I'm not used to all this This has nothing to do with my job Use this belt and it won't fall off your waist Spray this too She is an educated girl She will expect all this Don't know what she expected She loved that guy so much Who on earth imagined this kind of atrocity will happen What did you say? No, nothing You have decided to speak your mind, you might as well finish That girl is a graduate She would've married someone on her wavelength And led a peaceful life I think you messed it up big time I know it was wrong on my part I didn't do it purposely, Ravi anna Somehow I fell for her I'll tell you something Everyone has a childhood dream About the kind of girl he would want to marry But rarely does one get the girl of his dreams If you happen to see someone like that by chance... ...and if you can make your dream come true ...will you take it or not? Instead of dying yearning for her lifelong... ...better to make a mistake and regret for 5 minutes I'm human after all Not Gandhi In spite of wearing a belt it refuses to stay on my waist I heard you plan to kill my brother Is it true? I'll comply to every wish of yours But leave my brother alone Were you very close to the man my brother killed? How close is he to you? He is like my brother He taught me everything You claim he is like your brother He died just a few minutes ago You're not even grieving for him? You are intent on removing my jewelry What is her name? I have married her without knowing her name What you said is true Ravi is close to me Like my own brother He is dead I'm not feeling sad at all I want to cry But I am unable to Why? How will I know what is in your heart? Can I tell you what I feel? Then you shouldn't feel bad I feel- I feel like sleeping with you If you don't agree... ...I'm thinking of threatening you by saying 'I'll kill your brother' Don't get me wrong Our first night together Such a beautiful wife What else will I think? Should I switch off the light or let it stay? I'm okay with both Your wish Don't agree thinking I'm threatening you I told you what I felt I won't harm your brother Happy? Then...what's news? Who has come so early in the morning? Tell them I can't meet anyone today Office is closed today I've been invited for lunch at my sister-in-law's place Mudaliyar asked me to give this to you I thought he won't give me but he has changed his mind Proves my new wife is my lucky mascot Go and give this to Selvi Tell her I asked you to give it to her Okay Are you married? Wretched fellow! Get married soon It's sheer undiluted pleasure Yesterday was my wedding night She touched me Something melted inside Above all, the scent The scent of a woman Mixed with sandalwood and vermilion... ...I could not figure out whether it was the scent of her body or tresses What a rush of adrenalin! She placed her head here I felt giddy and slept for hours When I woke up in the morning- What is that film in which Saroja devi will sing a song? What is that song? "I heard the temple bell ring in my ears" She's a clone of Saroja Devi Hot coffee In the bed itself So clean Unlike the tea our boy brings with his fingers dipped into it I wonder how I drank that horrible stuff day in and day out Once I drank my coffee... ...she requested me to brush my teeth I went inside the bathroom and undressed She followed me and I wondered if she wanted a quickie in the morning She said she wanted to scrub my back! She scrubbed my body Shampooed and dried my hair It feels soft as silk First she used shampoo and then conditioner She rinsed my hair thoroughly I feel clean head to toe What's wrong with all of you? I'm talking and none of you seem to be happy for me What is the problem? I'm asking you Is there any problem? Mani- What happened to Mani? Mani joined Murthy's gang Bloody scumbag! Rogue Don't you have a better time to give me bad news? I spend half a night with my wife And then come back in 'cloud 9' mode You pile up bad news into my ears Why are you making my life miserable? Why couldn't this news have waited till tomorrow? You should tell me everything now And I should take a knife and run My shirt should be bloodstained There should be no fragrance of sandalwood or turmeric on me I should smell like a butcher Isn't it so? Kumar Now what is your bad news? What next? Not that- Then Krishnaveni has come I'm going back to my home town I thought you would marry me one day and we will have babies It's my fault Whatever said and done... ...I am not a virgin I'm leaving I came to tell you before I go Do you need money? What? You've given me a lot already Bye I didn't want to tell you this But I can't hide it from you I fainted last evening and the doctor congratulated me He said I'm pregnant I was only able to laugh I haven't decided as yet to go for an abortion or not If you were with me it's fine If not... ...people will malign him as a prostitute's son Don't know if my hometown is equipped with abortions I'll manage What else to say? I only feel like crying I want to go alone and cry I anyway have to go a 1000 kilometers alone I can do my crying in the bus 'Hey! Look how happy Jeeva is' 'He got his sister married' Would you have married me if I was not pregnant? Selvi, I did not do it purposely Poor girl! If you keep sulking won't I feel sad? Isn't one girl enough for a night? Take your tablets properly Okay Look at him My dear? What? Doctor, will my son look like this? What did the doctor say at the hospital? Boy or girl? You have changed a lot It seems you are taking very good care of her You take her to the hospital The old rowdy in you has vanished Are you so fond of babies? I am myself clueless, Selvi This seems to be a new kind of joy There should be a purpose in making money, right? I've been thinking a lot I became like this because my father was not a decent man Then how should I bring up my son? He should be oblivious to a place like this I'll send him abroad Think about it He will come back and talk to me in English I won't understand a word I'll just say okay and listen Are you aware your boys are gossiping behind your back? What? Whether the baby is really yours! Why get angry? Her profession is such As if you married a virgin Anyway if you are convinced it is okay Nobody should laugh behind your back tomorrow Who knows, maybe one of your henchmen could be the father 'Kokki Kumar arrested for 30 murders Statement by his own assistant' There is no connection between Kumar and my party I've never met him under any circumstance nor any reason I can swear on my mother tongue I'm convinced it is an attempt to slander my party You took the bribe Not fair I've even gone to his house to check out They swear our boss is not in town They are making up stories he is in Madurai and Dindugal They will make use of us till their work is done Once their work is over they will ditch us We can't believe them Poor thing!
