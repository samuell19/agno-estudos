Get off him! [thudding and groaning] JULIE: Get off him! You're gonna kill him! Don't! You're gonna kill him! No! Ah! You gotta put an end to this! Ah! Stop it! You dirty Black git! JULIE: Help me! [MUSIC - DAVID GRAY, "FROM HERE YOU CAN ALMOST SEE THE SEA"] [SINGING] Come the weekend, and we'll be long gone, baby, just like the old days. Letting the world flow through me. Just a parasite in the line, smoking, killing the time, how long's a piece of twine. What use is sympathy? From here you can almost see the sea. If you would hold still, I'll make a clean incision. We could sit back. You like that? Ha, yeah, you like that. Careful you scratch your arm again, love. You're gonna hurt yourself. [vocalizing] Come on, give me that. [SINGING] From here you can almost see the sea. Just another fool in the line. Ah. I dream of high clouds. Flushed with the light of daybreak. I'm gonna dive in to water so cold it makes your bones ache. Fingers, knees, and knuckles scraped, all of the rubbish heaped. A piece of cardboard taped up where the bedroom window pane used to be. From here you can almost see the sea. [knocking] [yelling] Oh, hang on. I can't fit anymore in here. Get out the way. You haven't got rid of this lot yet, and you pile my ass up with more shit? And you're supposed to be my brother. Stop crying, Leigh-Anne. It's only for a couple of days. Yeah, well, there's too much of it. Well, we had to get done with it. Leigh-Anne! Fuck sake! What are you doing? [groans] Are you trying to chop my fucking head off! Nice, that, isn't it? Trying to kill your brother. Oh, come here, Gav. You know I didn't mean it. Get off. GAVIN: I should have [inaudible] your sister. STEPHEN: Do you reckon it runs in the family, guv? ROBBIE: I fucking hope not. GAVIN: Oi, [inaudible] tonight? Great. [inaudible] Which one of you got a fiver for the meter? [trills] I haven't got a penny, Leigh-Anne. What? I haven't got anything? Robbie? I'm skint now. How can you be skint? For fuck's sake, it's pitch black in here, in case you missed it. What are you doing? Rebecca's in there. You're not smoking a spiff in here. Come on, it's freezing outside. Not around Rebecca. I told you, you make her wheeze. Now piss off. Get out now. That's a shooting star, that is. My ass that is. You off your face already? What a beautiful thing. Stephen, you can't even see it. [laughs] It's like God sneezing. Aye, so that'd make it a giant snot, then. God's tear drop, my mum used to say. [indistinct chatter] Danno, you slag, come here. [MUSIC - DAVID GRAY, "FROM HERE YOU CAN ALMOST SEE THE SEA"] My mum's got the trainers you want for Rebecca. What? For Rebecca. Oh, yeah, right. Tell her I'll be around Monday. I ain't got the cash at the minute. Oi, Helen. Danno reckons, right, that you gave Anthony Mitchell a blowjob in the back of Quicksave and you gave him scabs all over his cock. [laughing] [inaudible] - No, I didn't. He made it up. Honestly, I didn't. I didn't. Hey! Hey! Why don't you all bloody shut up? You're too bloody noisy. [INDIAN ACCENT] Why don't you all shut up! You're too bloody noisy! Who let him out? Ah, don't be such a prick. And you, where's your bloody baby, eh? Hanging around the street like a fucking prostitute! Yeah, well, it's not your problem, is it? Cause my legs would never be wrapped around your back, not for no money, all right? Not with your fat lips, you wanker. [laughing] What? You're better than the telly, you are. Leigh-Anne, we can't approve another crisis loan. You were allocated one only last February. Yeah, but that was when my cooker was being fixed. I needed a hotplate. What am I supposed to do? Yes, but it's impossible for us to keep allocating while you're still owing. Oh so I'll just tell my baby to stop growing, shall I, until I've paid you lot off. Tell her to stop wanting food and hot water for a wash. Sorry, love, but I haven't paid for your last wash yet. There are places you can go if you're stuck for clothes for Rebecca. Have you tried the community office yet? There's always something on the board. Are your ears working? I need electricity tonight. The community office isn't gonna charge up my electricity for me now, is it? Be all right if I had a black face, though, wouldn't I? It's all right for you lot. Broad, bloody daylight, and you got the fucking lights on! Oi! Sorry. I'm really sorry, miss. Yeah, well, watch what you're doing, will you? Ah! [laughing] Little bastard. All right, love. I didn't know you were coming. I know. I finished bingo early. I thought I'd come around. God, it's dark in here. Why don't you put the lights on? Hello, lady love. Nana will be with you in a minute. Well, shall I get the kettle on, then? You can't. The electric is off. Still? Haven't you put it back on yet? Of course, I did. It's run out again, that's all. Her eczema started up again. I know. How's her breathing? Fine, Annette. Oh, Leigh-Anne, for God's sake, you can't keep milk fresh like that. It won't stay cold. It's freezing by that window. It's not cold enough. You'll make yourself sick, and Rebecca. I don't know how long you've been saying you'll get a fridge sorted. What do you want me to do, Annette, pull one out of my ass? Don't be so bloody cheeky. Yeah, well, what did you expect? And if you're so bothered about a fridge, tell your son to buy us one. No, Leigh-Anne, that's not fair. And who said anything about fair? He hasn't even bought us a ton of beans since Rebecca was born. He just fucked off. Now, how fair is that? You little cow, Dylan hasn't done it on purpose. Well, I should hope not. Nobody gets banged up on purpose. Stop shouting, Leigh-Anne. Can't you see you're frightening her. Don't be stupid, Annette. That's half your problem. You can't see the shit for the trees, can you? You don't know what's good for that child and what's not. Of course, I do. I do everything for her, everything. I do it all by myself, not one bloody person helps me, right? Look, I'm not having a go. I just think it's a lot for you at the moment. You got to think what's best for her. Maybe she'll be better off, you know? I've told you before, you can always give her to me. Leigh-Anne, I've always said... Rebecca is my baby! She's mine, all right! So why don't you piss off out of here before I hurt you. Gav, get us a beer. That's all I got. But I will have more later though. I got this lot to flog. You were supposed to be looking for a fridge for me today. - I know. But something came up. Are you taking the piss now? Look, I'm not joking no more. I want that crap blocking my passage flogged. And I want at least 20 quid out of it for me. Or I flog it myself, and you lot won't see a penny. [music - Roosvelt, "body parts"] Pint of lager. [SINGING] ...chain for that forbidden vice. While I wake up in the morning with a brand new vibe. I'm selling body parts. I don't mean to boast. I'm selling body parts. Not with your boyfriend tonight? Surely, you can do better than that. Oh, you've got a mouth on you. But I like that. Oh, do you? Well, you must be the man I've been waiting for all my life then? Do you want to get some air? I'm skint, bro. Next, please? BOTH: Can I have... Oh, sorry. You were here before me. No, you first. No, go on. Weren't you even going to buy me a drink first? Look, lad, why don't you buy the girl a cider, then it don't matter who goes first. You all right, Helen? I think she fancies him. What? Have you not got yourself a boyfriend, yet? No. I'm not allowed, not until I'm 15. My god, that's ages. 15 and never had a shag. You won't know your ass, mate. You'd look a right mong. No guy around here wants a girl who doesn't know what she's doing. Pretty girl like you. Bet you could get any fella you want. Helen, where you going? Look, piss off. See you back in half an hour. Helen! I'm all right. I won't be long. What am I supposed to do? Just wait here. I don't know. Look, do you want to be backwater all your life or what? How much, then? 15, 30, depends what you want. Don't take the piss. I can get it for half that in town. Not a brand spanking new one, you won't. Just open your legs. Let him do the rest. [moaning] [baby crying] Hey, you. [inaudible] I can fucking get one. Ah! What have you done with my mobile phone? - I haven't got it. - Fuck off, you have! I haven't. Hey, come on, you let him alone! Are you deaf? Cheap piece of crap. Shove your fucking ass when I get a hold of you! Any excuse to play with an asshole! I'll have you, Rajan! Shut up, woman! Stephen! Stephen! What! Those papers are on your bed. Get going. [knocking] I still want you to think about this. I don't have to think about it. You got a lot of changes coming up, Stephen. You're leaving here soon. You got all sorts to get used to. This is a big deal. That's why I'm doing it. I just want to make it clean, make it fresh. I'm walking around with his name like a badge. And he's never even seen me. I don't even know who he is. Carrying someone's name means you belong to 'em, right? I don't belong to him. I don't want to be Rajan no more. I don't want it. I could really do with a pack of those. Oh, it's you. I thought my luck was in for a minute. That'd be a first. Go on, then. Pound. Robbie, I'm not paying you. And I haven't got a pound anyway. Tough. Why do you have to be so mean? And why do you have to be so greedy? Why do you have to be so ugly? Get lost, I'm not ugly. Been fighting this lot off all day. It's your fags they're after, love, not your body. It's my [inaudible] brain, if you really want to know. Hold onto her a sec. What? Yeah. Leigh-Anne. Leigh-Anne, I'm not doing any freebies. This is a business, not a bloody charity. Oh, fine. Just don't expect to be dossing on my floor tonight. Oh, and you can shift that gear you got stashed in my passage and all. Because I ain't no bloody charity either. Hiya. Where's my sister? Karen? Oh, I'm gonna have to get Gavin to find me a new iron. Your father won't take a blind bit of notice of me. Hiya. Right smell Will you watch her for me tonight? Yeah, fiver though. Mom, he's chewing my CD. How'd he get hold of that. Well, I didn't feed it to him, did I? What are you doing here? Just wanted to see Karen. [coughing] Pass me my fags, Terry, will you? Oh, for crying out loud, I can't see this. Can you see this? Give it here. Let me have a go then? No, not today. She's wet and I don't want a mess on you. Is that right? You got the same knack for lying your mother had. And you don't want a reminder of her, do you? Suppose that's why you married her sister. You're looking for a slap, yeah? Yeah, all right, you two. I'm going. All right, then. Karen, don't forget tonight. Yeah. Leigh-Anne, put it back. What? I said put it back. Dad! Drop it! Stop! For God's sake, man, Terry. [inaudible] I should shove your stupid face straight through this thing. [exertion sounds] Ah! [laughs] Ah! [laughs] Ah! Stop it! Right. Get off! Ah! [laughs] You! You would do this to me? Your dad? Father, no! Ah! [laughs] Father, that is enough. Who is it then? Hello, Leigh-Anne. Hang on a minute. What are you doing here? I've come for Rebecca's trainers. I thought you weren't coming till Monday. Yeah, well, I ran into a bit of luck. Well, don't just stand there. Go and get Leigh-Anne a drink. Hey, what's that? Is he gone? He's on your head. [rock music] [SINGING] The back of beyond now. Baby, you're empty. [inaudible] losing that soul now. Yeah, baby, you're [inaudible]. You met everybody else face down. [knocking] Did you order a fridge, madam? Oh my god. Out the way, now. Oh. It's still dripping. Well, we'll take it back then, shall we? Here. For all that stuff. A tenner each, that's what we got. All right, let's have a look then. God, bloody hell, It's still got food in it. Yeah, a proper job, that is. We aim to please. [SINGING] Feed me till I want no more, want no more. [SINGING] Feed me till I want no more. You're supposed to put holes in that. [inaudible] doing it. See what the packet says, you div. Don't give it to me. It says make sure it's hot and eat it. [SINGING] Pilgrim through this barren land. [SINGING] I am weak, but thou art mighty. Hold me with thy powerful hand. Bread of heaven. Bread of... [SINGING] Shag of heaven, fuck me till I want no more. Fuck me till I want no more. Stephen, that is so stupid. - Where's the beers then, guv? - Oh, shit. I left 'em in the car. Right, who of you did this to my car? What the fuck is he on about? What are you? Animals? You act like stray dogs, left to roam and damage this place. What's wrong with you? Look, you stupid wonk, take yourself in and close your door before I do it for you. Cocky bastard, ain't you? Listen, you don't own this fucking street, you know? You're in someone else's country. Show a bit of respect, all right? I've been here 30 years. How long you been here? - Prat. - Oh, come on He's taking the piss. You should have smacked him one. Tell you what, I gotta get out of here soon. I can't take it around here no more. I go up to Social, all right, and there's some Paki git telling me why I can't sign on. I turn around, and the place is full of Pakis queuing up behind me. Do you know what I mean? How can you get anything around here anymore when all they want to do is give it to the Pakis? Well, you just take it back off 'em, don't you? Yeah, but I shouldn't have to, should I? I'm Welsh me, right? I was born here. My mama was born here. And I can't get nothing no more. A white face is like shit 'round here now. Don't mean nothing. So where are you going to go then? There's Pakis everywhere, you know? London. You joking, Rob? That's like, proper Paki land. Proper nigger land. Why should we be the ones to get out anyway? They are the ones that shouldn't be here. Because I'm fed up with living in a shit hole, that's why. I don't want to get stuck around here. They should drop a bomb on the whole place, Pakis and all. Amen. [inaudible] [laughs] Fucking A. What's Gavin got in his back of tricks, then? Don't get excited. There's nothing but a load of dodgy crap, and he's charging for everything tonight. She's only got two left. Oh, you're all right. Go on. Just have to owe me one or give me one. I don't mind which. Gavin. Do you remember when it was me, you, Robbie, and Dylan in that hostel. We used to pass them new houses full of Pakis. Yeah, and? I just thought you might need reminding, that's all. But Judy's not a Paki. Yeah, well, she might as well be. Do you know how long I've been asking to get my damp sorted? They got fitted with a new bath last week. You work it out. They're filling up our brand new block. And you and Robbie still dossing in that squat, do you know what I mean? You want to change your name, call yourself Abdullah. No, Mohamed. Gavin Mohamed. Oh, come on, you prick. [laughs] Come on, boyo. Come on. Oh, you wanker. Oi! This isn't cooked. It's bloody raw. Oh. That's angin'. You selling bloody raw food in here or what? What is wrong? It's fucking raw, that's what's wrong. Yeah. STEPHEN: Gimme a new one. You want to watch you don't catch something. Wipe their asses with their hands, this lot do. STEPHEN: What are you looking at? Don't you? SHOP OWNER: I wasn't looking at anything, sir. What's the matter? Can't speak the English? STEPHEN: I want my money back. SHOP OWNER: No, I can't. I know what you did to Helen, you know? So you better watch yourself, 'cause she can have you for it. Look here, if you tell anyone, they'll take your little friend away, stick her in a little hole for baby slags, and I hope they send you with her. Because I'll tell 'em you were there, too. STEPHEN: Fucking Pakis rip me off all the time! GAVIN: What's going on? Nothing. She's just got a bit of a mouth on her, that's all. Thanks, Gavin. STEPHEN: Fucking give me my money back. I don't know how you can even think about her without gagging. ROBBIE: Oh, come on, then. Yeah, fucking have at it, you prick. Go. Go. Go. Yeah, who wants your dirty fucking food anyway? [inaudible] Ooh, a bit of wood. Just shove it up your ass, you dick. Come on, you twat. [inaudible] SHOP OWNER: Please no. Please no. Go on, put it out your frying pan. SHOP OWNER: Go! Piss off. Where's your mate? - She's gone. - Gone? Where? Gone home. Look, can you just piss off before your sister catches up. She won't. I'm gonna get her back for that, you know? Don't. Why? What are you gonna do about it? I'm not scared of none of you lot, you know. You think you can take the piss just because... - I don't. - Yes, you do. I don't take the piss. I like you. My mom's white, anyway. I know. [laughing and yelling] What I said about my mom, what I mean is, don't think I'm ashamed of my dad because I'm not. You can't make me ashamed of what I am. Do you fancy a spliff? Kill the Pakis! [laughing] Come on, you fucking idiot! [yelling and laughing] [MUSIC - DAVID GRAY, "FROM HERE YOU CAN ALMOST SEE THE SEA"] Oh, it's you. Only a quick drop in. Shouldn't she be having a nap in her cot? She don't like it in there. Anyway, I like her near me where I can see her. You were sorting out your fridge the last time I was here. How's that going? You still having problems? No, everything is fine. God, I sorted that out ages ago. Got myself a nice little fridge. Do you want to have a look? I mean, it's not new, but it does the job, doesn't it? [yelling] Come on! What did you just say to that social woman? What did you say to her? Fat Paki. I'm Turkish, you bloody idiot. Annette! Annette, open this bloody door now! Come on, I know you can hear me. Come on, rent-a-gob! Annette! What are you playing at? You sly cow, opening your toothless gob to the social again. What? Get off me, you daft tart! Go home! Who's looking after Rebecca while you're out here off your empty head? Oh, excuse me, I'm forgetting. Ms. Mother bloody Teresa, innit, you two faced cow. Where are your kids, then? Leigh-Anne, I can't be bothered. Two sons banged up, one tried jumping off a bridge because of what you let your husband do to him. You little bitch. I'm twice the mother you could ever hope to be and 10 times the mother you ever had. Yeah, well, sort your own kids out, then, and leave mine alone. You stupid, stupid girl. The whole world knows you don't know how to look after that baby. Well, if you're going to start pointing fingers, get ready to point all 10. [groans] Rebecca is my granddaughter. She's sick. She needs an hospital. And you'll never stop me from doing what's right for her. You're just too selfish. Rebecca is not sick. She is not. I can hear how she's wheezing, fighting for her breath. I can see what she is doing to her skin. . That baby needs proper love. You think you can love my baby more than I do? Rebecca is the only thing in this world that I give a shit about and the only thing in this world that gives a shit about me. So I'm warning you, come near either of us again, and I'll cut you in fucking half. Don't you take me on, Leigh-Anne. I'll have social services take Rebecca away quicker than you can say her name. I'll have you in the bloody courts if I have to. Yeah, well, you're used to them, ain't you? Do you know, I'm really not sure how you can live this way. Neither am I. [chatter] Julie. Hiya. What are you doing? Oh, this is where you go to school then? Yeah. What are you doing here? Oh, I have a mate on the estate. I've been up at his... Are you getting a bus back? Yeah. You? Yeah. I want to get some sweets on the corner, though. OK. Robbie tries to come on in the outside, but Hughes is just too fast. Nobody can touch him. Ha, and Stephen Hughes scores his ninth goal of the season. How much more talent this young lad got left inside him? Why do you keep doing that? What? You keep calling yourself Steve Hughes. I like it. But it's not your name. So what? I can call myself whatever I like. I'm changing my name anyway. You are? Yep. Doing it properly, legal and everything. And when it's over, my name will be Hughes. And nobody can say anything. Cut out all the shit and support the team in one go, how slick is that? Welsh sporting history in the making, manager Mark Hughes brings his younger brother Stephen on as a substitute. Clear off and find something to do. Have you heard of work? Got an interview tomorrow, as it happens, you saggy twat. Don't be so bloody rude. I'm not your enemy, you little tosser. One, two, three. One more. Hey! Good girl. So have you really got a job interview? Old people's home. Saw an ad in the paper. I wanna make some proper money. Get away from here for good. It will last five minutes. What? Well, Anthony Mitchell got a job doing exactly the same thing. Found out he had a record, dropped him just like that. I haven't got a record. Yeah, but they take one look at you and it won't make a difference. And where you gonna tell 'em you live? In your squat? Don't start now, Rob. I was gonna tell 'em I live here. You wanna watch it, Leigh-Anne. He's trying to get his feet under the table. Fuck off, I am. You don't fool me, pal. Come on. - Come on, then. - Sit down. Do you know what? I haven't had a shag in ages. Don't start, Leigh-Anne. Fancy a shag? You're being a bitch. Fuck off with it, Rob. I got work to do here. You don't even fancy him. Why do you want to go and shag a Paki for? Don't fucking call me Paki. I'm Welsh, me, right? Changing your name don't make you Welsh. Your mother's a slag who got shagged by a Paki? So what's that make you, eh? I've never even spoken to my dad, right? So how could I be a Paki? Look at me. You look more like a Paki than I do. [moaning] [MUSIC - DAVID GRAY, "FROM HERE YOU CAN ALMOST SEE THE SEA"] [SINGING] Come the weekend, we'll be long gone, baby. Come the weekend, we'll be long gone, baby. Just like the old days. Letting the world flow through me. 'Cause come the weekend, we'll be long gone baby. Robbie? Stephen! Robbie! Leigh-Anne? He wouldn't have taken her far. That's him. Robbie. Robbie, give her here? What? Hang on. What are you playing at? What? I took her out. Her breathing was crap. You weren't looking after her, were you? Don't you say that. Don't you ever say that. Oh, she's all right, isn't she? You don't go around taking people's kids. What are you, some weirdo? Oh fuck off, Leigh-Anne. No, you fuck off! Get lost. No qualifications. Not really a problem. It's attitude and stamina that count in a job like this. The rest you can learn. So why do you want to work in a home for the aged? Well, I want to give back to my community. And... and I think you can learn a lot from old... the aged. Plus, I get on really well with my nan. Right, let's have a look. And how would you get to work? Because some of the shifts start very early. Do you drive or are you nearby? Brynteg. Oh, whereabouts? The Down. Lake Down? Right. I'm sorry, Robbie. I wouldn't do it to you. I couldn't. The early shifts would be murder. [MUSIC - DAVID GRAY, "FROM HERE YOU CAN ALMOST SEE THE SEA"] Have you seen your door? I'm going to kill that bitch. I'm going to smash your face in for that, you little slag. You gonna buy me a new fucking door? You can't prove nothing. If you think you're so clever, you better get it off. Why? That's what you are, innit? You sell kids to perverts? Shut up. You know what that makes you? It makes you a pervert and all. I said shut up. Hey, hey, hey! What'd you buy with the money, Leigh-Anne? A little dress? A joint? Or a nice pair trainers for your baby. I said no. You're a fucking liar. You whore out little girls to buy clothes for you and your baby. I did it once, one time that's all. We didn't have no electricity. We were cold. Useless. I'm not useless. Stephen! I'm gonna get you for this. I don't want to fill in another form. We have to sleep in that room. It's so bloody damp, there's hardly any wall paper left. My baby can't breathe. Look at her skin. And she's tearing herself to bits. We can't do anything unless you fill in the form. What form? I mean, how many times? I fill in that crap, you send some twat around, and a week later, the water is shitty and slimy again. WOMAN IN LINE: Oh, for God's sake, what's the matter with her? What the fuck are you looking at? I waited my turn, didn't I? So why don't you wait yours. Look, I don't want any more patch up jobs, I want it sorted or I want to be moved. If it's a transfer you want, that's a completely different form. - Oh, that's it. Who's in charge around here? What's going on here? Why can't anyone listen to me? GAVIN: Come see my place. JULIE: [inaudible] for a minute. Leigh-Anne would kill me if she finds out I've been here. [inaudible] You gotta meet my dad at [inaudible].. And where are you going tonight? GAVIN: Just out with the boys. God, it's massive. Yeah, I said. So is it Robbie and Stephen and you, then? No, not Stephen. He's still in the kid's home, isn't he? Me and Leigh-Anne nearly ended up there, as well. After... Your mum. It's OK. I know she killed herself. Mine's dead too. So why? Why what? Why didn't they take you away? Brenda, my mom's sister, dad took up with her. And she wouldn't let him. So he kept us and beat the shit out of us every day instead. Imagine what it'd be like to live here, a massive kitchen, loads of bedrooms for the kids. And a bath like that. We could both get in it. Would you love me? Course I'd love you. [MUSIC - DAVID GRAY, "FROM HERE YOU CAN ALMOST SEE THE SEA"] You haven't got a condom? Yeah. Oh, you liar. She's not well, is she? And I got the [inaudible] next week. [inaudible] And if I take her to the doctors, it'll only do the same. I don't know. I mean, what's the bloody point, huh? I'll have her tonight. I don't mind. Go on. Off you go, Stephen Hughes. [baby screaming] What happened? What happened? [screaming continues] Have you got a bandage or something? No, love, sorry, I haven't. The bloke across the road says you shouldn't bandage a burn. What bloke? You shouldn't have told him it was Rebecca. Hello, my love. Are you all right? Now, what's happened to you, then, eh? What's happened here? What's happened to her hand? None of your bloody business. What the bloody hell have you done to that child now? Fuck off, Annette. Come on. I can't. I gotta be back in school. - Please. No, I can't. Julie, get in the car. Don't you put another of your filthy, stinking fingers on my daughter again, ever. You hear? Bollocks. Who do you think you're talking to? Let me tell you something, you are not my equal. Get in the car! Get your hands off her! You don't want me to kill you, you take your hands off me. You're no threat to me, you fucking Black bastard, so piss off. See? Fuck! [baby crying] Take her to the hospital. I can't. I'm not gonna have them say it's my fault like they always do, acting like I can't look after her properly. [baby screaming] [indistinct chatter] What's happened to the hand? She hurt it a few days ago. A burn? This needs to be looked at. It's infected. We're gonna keep her in for now. In the meantime, we'd like you to talk to someone from social services. Why are you keeping her in? OK, look, it's nothing to get wound up about. Just tell me. Rebecca is on the At Risk Register. It's just a precaution. They've also contacted your social worker. It shouldn't take her long to get here. Black bastard! Fucking... Ah! Shit. [baby crying] Come on. Where you been? The hospital. Robbie, I need some blow. Ah, she stinks Leigh-Anne. Oh, don't be such a twat. Pass her here. We were gonna have a drive around first. Oh, in this little piece of shit? If you're gonna nick a car, nick a decent one. And Robbie, I need a smoke now. All right. What's up with you? Nothing. They tried to take her off me. Again? They know about Rebecca's hand. What'd you tell 'em for? I didn't. The fat Blackie grassed on me. You wait till I get a hold of him. [MUSIC - STEREOPHONICS, "A THOUSAND TREES"] [SINGING] Standing at the bus stop with my shopping in my hands when I'm overhearing elder ladies as the rumors start to fly. [SINGING] You can hear it in the schoolyard, in the scrap yard, in the chip shop, in the phone box, in the pool hall, in the shoe store, every corner, turn around. It started with a school girl who was running, running home to her mom and dad. She said she was playing in the change room of the local football side. They said, "tell us again." She told them again. "Tell us the truth." They said it's hard to believe. Cause he taught our boy Steve, he even trained me, taught our John who's a father of three. Only takes one tree to make a thousand matches. It only takes one match to burn a thousand trees. A thousand trees. Stop the car. What? I gotta change, Rebecca. Thank God. Why do you have to stop for? Look, I haven't got any tissues. She needs cleaning up. Look, just stop the car, will you? Let me go in the library. [groans] [vocalizing] That supposed to be funny? I'm laughing. I was thinking. Maybe I could get a hold of some paint and try and cover up some of that damp. Hold her for me. Am I allowed? Oh, come on, don't be stupid. She knows I'd never hurt her. You'd leave her, though, wouldn't you? So how are your plans for London? Look, sorry, I shouldn't have said anything. You're not her dad. I just think, you know... What? I think... I think Rebecca, she'd probably miss you. I'd probably miss her. Well, it's not like you have to go, is it? Do you want me to stay? Leigh-Anne? Why can't you just say it? Yeah. What? I want you to. What do you reckon you call a dike with fat fingers? Well hung. What are you doing up here? Nothing. Where did you get to? Let me other point You evil, Black bastard. You grassed on me. ANNOUNCER: Stand clear. Doors closing. Was that him? Yeah. Come on. Let's go have a laugh. Oh, fuck off, Robbie. This isn't a fucking laugh. He's trying to take my baby off me. Right. Come on. It's because of me. What's it got to do with you? We had a bit of a run-in. All right, boyo. ROBBIE: Fucking [inaudible],, I haven't seen so many books in my life. HASSAN: Julie, come on, it's getting late. JULIE: OK. I know where she gets that dirty big mouth from now. Hey, nigger face, fancy seeing you here. Come on, let's go. Oh, you Black fuck, you can't say nothing now, can you? Silly bastard, where you going? Yeah, come on then, don't spoil it. You can't go now. Fucking watch what you're doing! I'm going to have to ask you to leave. You're going the right way for a slap, you are. Fuck you, you Black bastard. What are you walking away for? Don't! Don't talk to me like that. JULIE: Dad! Come on, Steve. Dad, where's the car? Not far. You fucking prick. You touch me again, I'm gonna hurt you properly. Gavin! [groaning] Please, just let him go! [grunting and thudding] Get off him! You're gonna kill him! Come on, you fucking Black git! Oh, come on, guys, ease up, you fucking prick. LEIGH-ANNE: You want [inaudible],, you? He's had enough. He's a Black git. What do you care? Let him go! Please, let him... Ah! Let him go! Somebody needs to help! Help me! Fight, you fucking Pak! You dirty Black git! Heap of Paki shit! That will teach you to open your fat Paki gob. [spits] [sobs] I'm starving. I'm gonna get some chips. [sobbing] Oh, baba. I saw an ad today, hospital porter. Oh, yeah? I think I'm gonna have a go. Yeah? Might as well. Leigh-Anne Williams? Yeah? Leigh-Anne, can we come in, love? We need to talk to you. Why? Hassan Osman, across the street, he died today, Leigh-Anne. He died? [baby crying] Do you want to pass her here? I've got to take her now. I've got to take her. She isn't well. She'll be well looked after. Don't worry. Look, no, piss off. We are taking your child away while you are questioned. No, please. What did you think would happen when you were kicking the life out of that man? Where did you think your baby would end up? Don't take her, please. That's it. Good girl. I said don't take her! Rebecca! Rebecca! [sobbing] I'm pregnant, you know. [sobs] Why? He grassed on me, I saw. Saw what? I saw you talking to him. He wanted Rebecca off me, you all did. I was Julie's social worker after her mother's accident. Oh, you're lying. I'm not lying. Hassan talked to me about his daughter, not you, not ever. But they're taking Rebecca. Nobody wanted to take Rebecca off you. I want her back. I want Rebecca back. I want my baby back! No! No! You can't take her from me! [sobs] [SHAKILY] I want her back. Please don't take her! Please! No! Please! No. No. I want my baby back! [sobbing] [MUSIC - DAVID GRAY, "MADDER RAIN"] [SINGING] Well, I don't want nowhere to go. There's nothing there I need to know. Cause every day is just the same. The shot of blue or madder rain. Madder rain. Madder rain. Madder rain. Madder rain. Ah, yeah. And I don't want. There's nothing there. And I don't want.
