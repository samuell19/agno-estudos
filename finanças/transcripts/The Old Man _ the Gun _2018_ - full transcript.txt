All right. Hey, excuse me. Need some help? No, I'm good. Well... Damn thing started choking up about a mile back. I tried to make it to the next exit but it conked out. Let me take a look. Think it's the radiator? It could be. Is it shot? I wouldn't be surprised. You know anything about cars? Uh, no, not really. So, where you headed? Oh, nowhere, really. - Just driving, huh? - Hmm. Just driving. Hey, I like that truck of yours. - Yeah. Me, too. - Yeah? I stole it. Did you? No. It was my husband's. Oh. Where's he at? Well, he's... He's dead. That's... That's where he's at. Oh. Can I ask you your name? Jewel. - Jewel? - Mm-hmm. - That's your name? - Yup. Why? You don't believe me? No, I believe you. It's just, uh... well, it does suit you. Can say that. So, what about you? What's your name, Mr. All-Dressed-Up - In-A-Blue Suit? I'm Bob. I'm Bob Callahan. So, where are you headed? Home. I've been on the road for a while. Doing what? Oh, this and that. I'm in sales. Oh. Selling what? As I said, a little of this... ...little of that. What are you looking for? - So, you like horses? - What? - That thing you're... - Oh! Yes! Yeah, I do. So, you're a cowgirl who likes stealing cars? - What else am I missing? - That's pretty much it. I have three horses. I live in the country. - Three horses? - I love to ride. - Yeah. - What are their names? - The horses? - Yeah. Wiley, Clementine, and Dorothy Jean. Dorothy Jean? Sounds like my kinda gal. Dorothy Jean. Do you ride? Me? No. No, never. Never have. - But it's on my list. - What list is that? Things I want to do but haven't done yet. Well, you better hurry up. Yeah, how come? Anything else? - No. No, I think we're good. - No, thank you. All right then. Whenever you're ready. Thank you. Sure. No, no! You gave me a lift. This is the least I can do. - No, no, don't worry about it. - Please, I insist. Thank you. So, uh, what did you say you do? Sales? - Yeah. - Like door-to-door? - Uh, no, no, no. - Bible salesman? No, definitely not. No. I'm kidding. Uh... can I tell you something? I don't know the first thing about sales. - Oh. - I just made it up. Well, what do you do then? Well, that's a secret. - Oh, is it now? - Yeah. And why is that? Well, because if I told you, you probably wouldn't want to see me again. Who said I was gonna see you again? Would you? This is... - You're not serious, are you? - I am. - This is a joke. - I'm serious. - Oh, come on. - No, joke. No, it's no joke. Why would you even tell me, then? Well, I think because I trust you. You just met me. Well, sometimes you just know is all. With me, you know? Well, you're still sitting here. Well, that's because I don't believe you. And if I did believe you... So, what'd be worse? If I'm lying about this or telling you the truth? Prove it. - Prove it? - Yeah. - You want me to prove it? - Yeah. What'll you do if I can? I won't walk out that door. No, I'm not gonna do it. I didn't think so. Not because I can't. Because it's just not my style. - Not your style? - Mnh-mnh. - You have style? - I do. Well, uh, tell me what that is then. - My style? - Yeah. Okay, well, let's take this place. This place is not my style. Say it was a bank. And instead of that counter up there, that was really a teller's window. And that lady standing there was the teller behind the window. And you just walk in, real calm, and you'd find yourself a spot - and you'd sit down... - Hold your horses! ...just like we're sitting here. And you wait and you watch. And that may take a couple of hours, might take a couple of days, even. But you wait. It's gotta feel right. The timing has to feel right. And when it does feel right, you make your move. So you walk right up, look her in the eye, and you say, "Ma'am, this is a robbery." And you show her the gun, like this. You say, "I want you to fill that bag "with money, hand it over to me. "And don't do anything stupid or foolish. "I wouldn't want you to get hurt. "'Cause I like you. "I like you a lot. "As a matter of fact, I might even be falling for you, so don't go breaking my heart now, okay." So, she'd fill up the bag with money. She'd hand it over to me. And I'd go out just the way I came in, real casual-like. And she'd... You tell me what she'd do? Hey. I'm just pulling your leg. His hands were shaking. That's what I kept noticing. His hands were shaking all over the place. If he had pulled that trigger, I don't even think he could have pulled the trigger, he was so jacked up. But if he had, I... Nah. Nah. Nah. You did the right thing. How you feeling? You okay? Hey. Hey, John! John! I don't wanna make it a big deal or nothing, but we all pitched in and got a little something for you. Oh, shit. The big 4-0. All downhill from here. Mm-hmm. We have to put all of them in because Daddy's here. Happy birthday! Oh, man! What is this? - A surprise! - Why didn't you tell me? Because then it wouldn't have been a surprise! Cake for breakfast? Birthday cake for breakfast? Sweetheart, whose idea was this? Oh, it was their idea. I tried telling them. Dad's going to be cranky, and he's not gonna want anyone bringing up his age. "Dear Mr. President..." They said they didn't care. "...I was sorry to hear that you got shot, and I'm happy to hear that you're feeling better." What about you? It's your birthday. I'm not saying a thing. "I know you probably can't tell me "because it's a secret, "but I bet there are lots of them "and wonder if you play hide and seek with the visitors. "I hope to visit some day and think it would be fun. "Thank you for making America safe. Yours truly, Abilene Hunt." Car 22, do you copy? Car 22, this is Dispatch. Do you copy? Babe, push that red button and tell them, "10-4." 10-4. Say, "10-4, good buddy." - 10-4, good buddy. - Hey, I wanna do it! Dude, tell her... push the red button... and say, "Dispatch, this is Robbery 7." Dispatch, this is Robbery 7. Please stop messing around. Say, "I gotta go... 10-2 real bad." I gotta go 10-2 real bad. Wait, what's 10-2? All right, you wanna wait in the car or you wanna come in? - Come in. - Wait. Can I have the keys so I can listen to the radio? Yeah. And write a note to your teacher because we're all going to be late. Got it. Come on. Come on, buddy! 10-2. Let's go! Who you praying to this time? Our Lady of, uh... Rare and Periodic Attendance. So, it's your choice, all right? You gotta choose? Yeah! Okay, so then pick whatever you want. I mean, you liked baseball, didn't you? - Yeah. - Okay, so pick baseball. Just pick whatever you want to pick. That's... that's the most important thing. Do the thing that you want to do. But make sure that you actually like it, you know what I mean? 'Cause you're stuck with it. Why are you looking at me like that? Do you like your job? Uh, excuse me, sir. Can I see the manager? Well, that would be me. What can I do for you this morning? Well, I'd like to ask about a business loan. Well, sure. I bet we can help you with that. Uh, what sort of business are we talking about? Oh. This kind. Sit down. Dad, I'm bored. What do you want me to do? So, how are you feeling today? Not so good, since you're asking. Well, the day's still young. I'm going to give this to you. And what I want you to do is fill it with money. You ever hear about that frog that went to the bank right there? No. A frog walked into a bank one day. And he walks right up to the teller. "May I speak..." Here they got a nameplate and his name, it says Mr. Paddywhack on it. He walks up to him and he says, "Excuse me, Mr. Paddywhack. "I'd like to talk to someone about taking out a loan." And Mr. Paddywhack looked at him and he said... "You can't get a loan. You're just a frog." And the frog says, "That doesn't seem fair. Would you go please speak to your manager?" So Mr. Paddywhack went back and he talked to the manager and he said... "Sir, there's a frog out there who's asking about taking out a loan." And his, uh, manager said, "Well, does he have any collateral?" Collateral is something you can, uh, get if you're... hold on to to make sure that people give their money back. And he said, "I don't know. I'll go ask." And he sat down. He goes back out to the frog and he says, "Do you have any collateral?" And, uh, the frog took out this little teeny, tiny glass pear, and he puts it on the counter and he said... "That glass pear is all I have in the world." And then Mr. Paddywhack takes it back to his manager and he says... So, we'll switch that from checking to savings? "Sir, this is all the frog has in the world." Thank you. The manager looks at him, and he looks at the little glass pear, and he says... He says, "It's a knick-knack, Paddywhack. Give the frog a loan." - You get it? - Yeah. I'd like to make a deposit. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. Please remain calm. It is my duty to inform you... that this bank has just been robbed. Step on it. Now, everybody just... Helen, I can handle this. - Sir, you cannot leave. - Sir! My daughter's in the car outside. - The police are on their way. - Listen... listen... Okay. I am the... I'm with the... The police will be here momentarily. You're not listening to what I'm telling you! I'm with the police department. John? What the hell are you doing here? Did you see anybody funny or something that looked out of place? So, how old exactly? Oh, I'd say he was about 50 or 60? - Closer to 60? - Yeah. - Or 50? - Yeah. Uh, 50 to 60. Sound about right to you, John? Mm-hmm. So what happened? Are you guys, okay? Um... You said he was armed? Yes, he had a gun. - You saw it? - Yes! - He pointed it at you? - Well, I... Well, no! But he said he had one! And I... - You did what he said. - Yes! - Because he said he had a gun. - Yes. And also... I mean, he was also sort of a gentleman. She don't speak a lick of English. And I don't know but one or two words in Spanish, both of which I employ liberally and... We seem to get along just fine. Bueno para ti. What am I supposed to say to that? Si? Si. Absolutamente. Oh, man. I know when I'm being made fun of, and I'm okay with that because I've got a good sense of humor about myself, sir. I've got a good sense of humor about you, too. Yeah, right. Get the hell out. She wants me to take her... ...down to Buenos Aires. - You ever been down there? - Nope. Well, apparently they've got some really good poetry. You're thinking of Chile. What's the difference? What about St. Louis? You ever been to St. Louis? Sure. I got an idea for a pretty good score up there. ...19 high school ROTC cadets from Lubbock. The man put his charges to bed at 9:30 on Friday, put on his snow shoes, and walked down the mountain to... Is it on the news? In local news today... bees! Nope. Nobody cares. Well, you care. - Don't you? - Trying to. I can't figure out if I need to try a whole lot harder or if I should just quit. So, you gonna quit and do what? I really don't know. Something useful. Something where I don't have to clean up a mess that keeps on making itself every time I turn around. Okay. You can quit. Or you can try and catch 'em. I didn't think you'd ever actually call. I didn't think you'd pick up. So we're even. - So, how's your truck? - Oh, it's all fixed up. - Yeah? - Yeah. How about you? You've been traveling a lot, I guess? Oh, yeah. Selling a lot of Bibles? Yeah. A whole lot. You're looking at one of the top five salesmen in the area right here. - Yeah? - Yup. I don't believe a word you say. Probably a good idea. You aren't wearing your hearing aid. Hmm? You're not wearing your hearing aid! I'm sorry, I can't hear ya. You're not wearing your... God. Hey. Got something for ya. John Hunt! John Hunt, where is he? There he is. Looks like your rainy-day robber is at it again. Laugh it up, Columbo. What do you got? Gene Dentler sent that over. Said it made him think of you. That's hilarious. Don't you worry about it, man. I've already got the AARP on the case. Hello. Gene. Hey, Gene Dentler. It's John Hunt here. Tell me about this robbery. Oh, you mean the old guy? Yeah, same story. Small haul. No prints, no MO, no nothing. So you got no leads, huh? What a fucking surprise. Mainly on account of nobody giving a shit. It's just kind of a funny story. Yeah. Nothing funnier than armed robbery. Yeah. Oh, you know, speaking of funny... here's where it gets interesting. I told my wife about the whole deal. And I guess she tells her sister, 'cause the next day, her sister calls me and she told me about a thing she read in the paper that sounds real similar. Old guy... with a gun. Oh, yeah? What's your, uh, your wife's sister's name? Hello, Marge. I'm calling about this robbery you had on June 8th. Is that case still open? Yes, ma'am. Would you fax it to me? Thank you. Now, what do you mean when you say more than one? Two? Excuse me. - Oh, hi. - Hi. I'd like to open up an account. Oh, great. What type of account do you have in mind? This kind. This kind. This kind. This enough for you? Keep 'em coming, please, Patty. God! Can I get some help? Okay, what we have here is five states. - 93 robberies. - In two years. And you think it's all the same guys? Hundred percent. So, how do the same three guys get away with all that? Well, they haven't gotten away with it. They just haven't been caught yet. So, what do you want to do? - What do we want to do? - Yeah. We're going to catch 'em. We're going to catch 'em. Hello. Oh. You crying? Don't cry. What are you crying for? This is my first day. Well, there's always a first time for everything, isn't there? Chin up. Okay. You're doing a great job. And how would you describe him? Well, he was, uh... he was very polite. He seemed like a nice enough fella. - He was... - Let me guess. - Uh, he was a gentleman. - Well, yeah. But he was more... - He just seemed happy. - Happy? Yeah. Did he look like either of these two guys here? Yeah. Sorta. I gue... He... he just seemed more... Happy. Come on! It looks terrible now because I started stripping the paper off thinking I'd change it. But then I found this on the plaster... and I couldn't bring myself to cover it up. I looked it up. That's the guy that built this house. He signed that about 100 years ago, and it's still there. Wiley here, I've had since he was born and Clementine... Clementine belonged to our neighbors, but she kept busting through our fence. So, we... We finally just gave up and bought her. So... all this belongs to you, huh? Yup. - Wow. - Me and the bank. Hmm. My kids keep telling me to sell it, but I love it too much. They say it's too expensive or that it's too much for me to handle on my own, but... I say, well, come on out and give me a hand, then. I'm not going anywhere. You're not married, are ya? No... Me? No. I was once though. That was when I was young. Got any kids? I hope not. - 75... - Yeah. - ...76... - Yes. - ...77... - Yup. Can I have a sip of your beer? No. Go. 78, 79, 80. 80. Okay, what comes after 80? - 81. - 81. Now that's a trail. You see a trail? Yeah. But where's the trail lead? The bad guy. To the bad guy. Now, where's that bad guy going? Can we get two more coffees over here, please? - How was the drive? - Long. - Long. - Romantic. Romantic? He didn't like my book-on-tape. It's big. Real big. What I want to know is how much they got in that truck. I'd like to talk to somebody about opening an IRA. Hi. Can you cash this for me please? - Certainly. - Thank you. - Will that be all? - Yeah. I see all my friends buying homes and doing these grown up things that shouldn't have seemed so big to me, but... when I'd add everything up, it just didn't make any sense until... Oh, until now, and everything's settled down... Sir. Sir, your cash. Oh. Thank you. ...they're in their right place. Oh, I'm a kid. My dad leaves. And when I turned a teenager, my, uh, mom remarried. And she remarried to a cop, so... - A cop? - Christ, I know. I'm already doing petty crime and that type of thing. Anyway, the first thing he does is he changes all the locks on the house. And, uh, and he writes a 30-page manifesto about what's gonna happen now that he's in charge. And things that we have to do, things we can no longer do, that type of thing. Well, anyways, it's Christmastime. I go out drinking, I come home late. The house is locked up like a federal prison. I... The only window available to me is a high window, and I get up into the high window and I get halfway through and I start losing my balance and I'm hanging on to the Christmas tree. And the balls are falling and the tinsels are tinseling. And I see through the tinsel, I see my stepfather in his whitey-tighties in a combat position with both hands on his revolver, and he's ready to squeeze one off. And he says... "Freeze! Freeze, sailor!" He's never referred to me as sailor before. It was a first. So I... Things got worse from there and... And that's why I hate Christmas. - Hello? - Hey! It's me. Oh, hello! Is it too late for me to call? No, it's... it's not that late. - So, what are you doing? - Just sitting at home, paying bills, procrastinating. - Just waiting for me to call? - Careful, now. Where are you anyway? Oh, somewhere in Oklahoma or Missouri, I don't know. It all seems the same to me. So, you wanna come find me? So, the vault. - The vault and the truck. - Hmm. You really think we can do it? Yeah, I think we can probably do it. We can probably do anything we set our minds to. I'm just saying, it sounds like we're showing off. Well, let's show off then. I'm so tired of doing the same score over and over again. It's penny-ante bullshit. I'm gonna be 67 years old. My bones hurt. Jesus Christ. I'm gonna start thinking about my future. My future. What are you thinking, Forrest? Do you think we can pull it off? - Yeah, probably. - Probably? Probably? You forget about Paterson? Probably didn't get you very far then. Yeah, but that was then. This is now. And now, I know what I'm doing. Yeah, I know, too. But I also know what I'm capable of. And these days, those are two different things. I don't have to calm down. No, don't touch me. I don't want to be cool. Just... Would you be quiet? What is wrong with my voice? What do I need to be quiet for? You should take me home. Your brother is... He tried to grab my boobs! What kind of man lets his brother try to touch someone's boobs? He's 13... ...controlled but caused heavy damage to the building and its contents. The arson inspectors say there were several points of instigation for the fire, and foul play has not been ruled out. We now go to Dallas, Texas, where police from multiple states have traced a series of dozens of bank robberies to a band of highly skilled robbers. Making this crime spree even more unusual? These suspects are a little bit older than your average criminals. Well, we figure them to be about 60 to 70 years old. For that reason, we're calling them "The Over the Hill Gang." - Good name. - Thank you. We came up with that. Folks from all around, some from Albuquerque and Little Rock just putting our heads together and hoping to nab these guys. So, old men robbing banks, it seems like they'd be fairly conspicuous. Any idea how they'd gotten away with it for so long? Well, no. But frankly, they have a whole lot more experience robbing banks than we do catching them. Think you'll be the one to catch 'em? Uh, I think that any of these fellas here who put in long hours and done some real hard work would like to do the job. But, yeah, I won't lie. I'd love to slap the cuffs on them myself. I hope that happens. I hope I get the chance. Here's hoping time doesn't catch up with them before you do. - Okay, thank you. - Thanks, Detective. - Thank you. - Ted, back to you. Hey, back already? You see the news? No. How's the weather? Blue skies. Hello? You gotta be kidding me. So, you can take a look on the tapes. They just sweep right in, lockstep with the guards. It's like they were escorting them to the vaults. Detective? Detective Hunt? We're this way. Um. Yeah, so, most people didn't even know what was going on. - Is this John Hunt? - Yeah. You're the talk of the town, Detective. I gotta get this straight. Okay. First, you followed them into the street, right? Yes. And then you fired at them? Yeah. Like I said, two times. - Gold? - Gold. Uh-huh. Well, what do you think they're gonna do with gold? You tell me. And they'd have gotten away scot-free except one of them stopped to leave this. That is one hell of a souvenir. They took off one of my love handles. You know, I never actually finished medical school. Come on. Come on. Come on. Don't tell me that, boy. We have some breaking news to tell you about right now. Police are looking for three suspects who attempted to rob First Nation's Bank... How are you doing? Huh? I'm all right. We almost did it, didn't we? No, we did do it. What are we looking for here? Stop right there. Stop it. Go back. Wait till the guards go past. No, no. It's there. It's there. You're moving forward. Go back. It's slow motion. It takes a second. You got to rewind it. It's rewinding. - You're going forward. - There you go, see. Come on, man. Just push... You're not even... you're pushing... - It's this one. Stop! Stop! - Go back to where it was. Don't stop on an empty frame! Stop on his face. There! Right there. Stop right there. Look at that. Is he smiling? Must be thinkin' of you. - Detective Hunt? - Yeah. Those the guys? Yeah. Hmm. Well, we're going to need those tapes. These tapes are my evidence. Not any longer they're not. It's a federal case now. Thank you very much. You know, the Bureau was actually put together to catch guys like these. Mm-hmm. There was Dillinger. Who else? Well, Dillinger and a bunch of other guys like him. Point is, you've done your part, John. You did a good job. Right. Hard part's over. Now's the part where we bring this home. Mmm. Yeah? That could be. You could bring this home. Or it could be that I puzzle things together. I find that clue. I crack the case. And maybe you come to me and you say, "Thanks, John. Let me shake your hand. "You puzzled things together. You cracked the case. That's good work." You remember something? Uhh... No. But they want the same thing you want. Yeah, that's true. So, why don't they just let you do it? They think that they can do it better. Can they? Probably. Can you get a tire iron, bud? Maybe it's a good thing. How's it a good thing? Because they aren't as good as you are. So they won't catch him. Well, thank you, babe. And if it was your job, you would definitely catch him. But that's why it's good that you're not. Because if you caught him, you wouldn't get to chase him anymore. I like how you think. That's that, isn't it? I'll be seeing you boys. Take care, Teddy. Say, I... Somethin' I've been meaning to ask you and, uh... You got a place across the street from a cemetery. For a reason? No. No. Okay. Okay. You really never thought about it? No, not really. Okay. All right. I'll see you next week. And think about laying low, okay. - All right. - Bye, Forrest. John? Come on, John. Don't look so sad, man. We don't need to waste our time on a bunch of old folks anyhow. What's that? Nothing. You sure you don't want to try? Maybe next time. Thought this was on your list? Oh, it still is. Come on. Come on. - So, do you miss him? - Oh, sure. But we got married when we were young. Like you did. And then the kids came and... Oh, you could kind of lose track of yourself, you know. At least I do. And it's so easy to assume that everything's fine. That this is fine. This is the way things are supposed to be. And so, you spend so much time thinking you're happy, and then one day you wake up and you realize, oh, maybe you aren't. Maybe you never were in the first place. Maybe you don't even know what that means. Then something happens, like you lose someone or... even your kids grow up and leave home, and you think... "What do I have left?" So, yeah, I miss him. And there's a part of me that always will, but... now I think, now it's okay to be selfish. 'Cause you think about... ten years from now, where will you be? What'll you be doing? Now, whenever I close the door, I think... "Oh, at least this is the last time "I'll ever have a chance to do whatever that thing was?" You know what I do when the door closes? - What's that? - I jump out the window. And look, if I ever wonder what I'm doing or where I'm going, I just think of myself as that little kid I was when I was just about this tall. And I say, well... now would he have been proud of me? And if the answer is no, well, then I just keep walking on through. But if the answer is yes, then I know I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. So, is he proud of ya? That little boy? Oh, he's getting closer every day. But you're never exactly where you're supposed to be, are ya? I mean, 'cause if you are, you're dead. And a little 10-year-old you. He's... You know, he might have hopes and dreams, but... he doesn't understand time... or the world like you do. So... Think you gotta keep on keeping on. Just living your life. Trying new things. Just gotta... keep on pushing. Uh, ma'am, excuse me. I would like to speak to the manager. Yes, that's me. What can I do for you? Okay, so you want to take over the mortgage? I do. I'd like to pay for it all upfront. Well, that can certainly be done, but she would need to come in and sign over the... Well, I'd like it to be a surprise. Oh, I see. See, I give you the money... and then she didn't necessarily have to know about it. Well, that's a heck of a Christmas present. So, you have a few options. One is you could make a gift to her. The other is she could come in and sign the property over to you. No, no, no. I don't want to do that. I just want to pay for it all and not have her necessarily know about it. Well, she'll know one way or another. But what if I had the money here? - Right now? - Yes. - You have it? - No, but what if I did? She'd still need to come in and sign off on some paperwork. I see. I-It would be very easy. Just a quick bit of paperwork. Yeah. Just not right now though. No. Okay, well... thank you. Thank you. Is it all right if I call you Dorothy? Dot. You can call me Dot. All right. I'm going to record this conversation - if that's all right with you. - Okay. So... why don't you just tell me what you remember? Okay. Um... Well... Wait, I'm sorry. Hang on a second. It's okay. I don't usually do the... You made it worse. - There we go. All right. Yup. - It's okay? Sorry about that. So, uh... - Should I start again? - Yeah. Okay. Um... Gosh. Well, he and my mom were only together for two years, so... I never met him that I can recall. By the time I was born, he was... already in prison. My brother says that he... he thinks he can remember him a little bit, but I don't know if he really does... or if he just thinks he does 'cause... You know how it is. You hear a story and... you see a picture and you kind of put two and two together. And we heard all kinds of stories. She told us all kinds of stories about him. And they didn't really add up, but we were just kids, so... He was off sailing the high seas one year and... - I think he was off to war... - Big stories. - Yeah. Exactly. - All right. Okay. Didn't really make any difference. He was just dad and... he was doing stuff and... someday he was gonna come back and see us. And then, um... ...I think I was 15 and, uh... I guess he was gonna be paroled, so... my mom, she sat us down and told us the truth. Just in case he came looking for us, but... Well, he never did, so... And so he never called you? He never wrote? - Oh, no. - Mm-hmm. No. No, he didn't. Uh... I guess for all I know, he doesn't know I exist. And he's a grandpa. Yeah, I guess he is. - What's his name? - Oh, that's Robbie. Robbie, sweetheart, you want to say hi? - No. - No? - Sorry. - No, that's all right. I got a boy just about his age. So, you think you're gonna catch him? Well, I hope so. Well, if you do, I don't wanna see him. I don't wanna have to come in and pick him out of... what's it... a lineup or whatever it's called, okay. No, that won't be necessary. You know, I think he should be locked up. You know, my momma told me that... he always said... "Oh, I'm a changed man now." And then he would just get out and he'd just do it all over again. And again and again. Even after all that, you know, she loved him till the day she died. How about this guy? That's beautiful. Oh, it's too much money. What about something... How about this one? I love this piece. - Would you like to try it on? - I would. Oh. Oh. Take your time. What do you think? Let's see it in the light here. Oh, I am so embarrassed! I just walked right off. I felt so... I'm so sorry! Would you like me to help you take it off? No. Um... I'll take it. - How much? - $249.99 with tax. Yeah, I held on to all of this stuff. Back when I represented him... I thought maybe I'd write a book or something like that or maybe even just tell my grandkids about it. It's such a great story. Is that the man you're looking for? Yeah, I do believe it is. Man, I remember Forrest Tucker. He was the real deal. Holy smokes. Age 13, bicycle theft. That's getting an early start. He spent his whole life locked up. Except for the times that he broke out. Sixteen successful escapes. - Sixteen? - Uh-huh. That's some kind of record, right? A few years back, he broke out of San Quentin in a boat... he built out of scrap wood and tarp and who knows what else. Painted the Marin County logo on the side and sailed right on out of there. You ever meet him, he'll tell you all about it. He'll tell you every detail of every adventure he ever had. And probably a few that he didn't. Maybe somebody should have told him to quit while he was ahead. Well, you find something you love. I got put on his case when he got caught in Montana a few years back. There was a chase... which I learned was not unusual at all. Well, when they got to the showdown, the cops said that he fired on them. But he claimed that, uh, he didn't even have a gun. That it was just his car backfiring. I expect that's probably half true. He did always have a gun on him, but if you told me that he had never fired that thing once in his life, I'd believe ya. I remember I sat down with him once and I said, "Forrest... "surely there's an easier way for somebody in your position to make a living." And he looked at me and he said, "Brother... "I'm not talking about making a living. I'm just talking about living." Keep your hands where I can see 'em! Better not be crossed. Hi, baby. Hi. Did you find him? Yeah, sorta. What's that mean? Well... I figured out who he is. And? He's a guy who is old... but used to be young. And he just loves robbing banks. - That's it? - That's it. Just like you're a guy who's a cop... who's gonna catch him. Yeah. Something like that. It's late. - It's not that late, baby. - The kids are asleep. How asleep are they? Oh, my goodness. - Come on. Let's go out. - What? Let's go out. Let's get a babysitter. I have to work in the morning. - So what? - What? - What is going on with you? - I don't know. Wait, shouldn't you be calling somebody? But shouldn't... No. Telling who? That you found him? Tell who? Tell them? I'm not telling anybody. Tonight he's all mine. Hey. Yeah. You really just drifted off into outer space. Yeah. Hey, you wanna get out of here? Oh, we just ordered pie. No, I mean really get out of here. Like take a trip somewhere. - Like a vacation? - Yeah. Oh. I don't know, I... You know, I've got the animals to take care of and... Yeah, but say that wasn't a problem. Would you want to? Maybe. Okay. Hey! Didn't I see you on TV? - Oh, maybe. - No, I think so. You were involved in that... What were you call... The Over The Hill Gang, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Did you catch them? Not yet. Hmm. You close? Oh, we're getting there. Excuse me. I don't want to be rude here, but... straighten this out a little bit. I was forced to learn how to do this in Catholic school. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. There you go. Looking sharp. You got a gal with you? I got my wife with me, yeah. Oh, this is great. It's been my experience that looking sharp will take you a long, long way. Make you look like you know what you're doing. Even if you don't. Forrest? I know what I'm doing. Goodnight. Forrest Tucker, you are under arrest. Step away from the car! Put your hands up and step away from the car now! Don't do it! Get out of the car! Two cars south bound on... FS-522 going south bound... Please. Please. My boy. Okay. Pull over here. Is he okay? Mm-hmm. I understand. Okay, well. Hey, thanks for calling. All right. What happened? Well, they caught him. - They did? - Yeah. - Yup. - How? Oh, somebody talked. Hmm. Now what? He'll go to prison. Hmm. That's too bad. Yeah, I guess so. I'm sorry you didn't catch him. I'm not. The Over the Hill Gang is no more. Last night, federal agents in Fort Worth arrested the leader of the group, 74-year-old Forrest Silver Tucker. Tucker, a native of Florida, is best remembered in the Bay area for engineering... ...one of the most innovative prison breaks in San Quentin history. That is just one of a long list of escapes and an even longer list of crimes. But after a few years on the lam, time has officially caught up with this career criminal. Also arrested, fellow convict Teddy Green whom Tucker met in San Quentin. A third member of the gang is still at large, but for the time being, police say The Over the Hill Gang is officially retired. Forrest Tucker, you got a visitor. You lied to me about your name. Well, I figured you knew. That's what the detectives asked me, if I knew. If I even had the slightest idea. - Hmm, what'd you say? - Said of course not. I'm sorry. Well, me too. Here. I wrote something for you. What's this? These are all the times I broke out before. You coming, Forrest? Oh, I'm gonna finish up here. I'll be with you in a minute. Okay. What about this one? Well... kinda saving the best for last. Well... maybe, uh... maybe you should just stay put. Mudroom's right across the hall if you need anything. Okay. You can stay as long as you want to. Thanks. I'm glad you called. Well, I'm glad you picked up. Then we'll go on. Doesn't matter where. Maybe we'll run over to Arizona. The roads are straight. And we'll build a house. Yeah, we'll build a house. Because if I'm not grounded pretty soon... I'm going to go into orbit. Jewel, wake up. I need to go out for a bit. Do you need anything? No. How long you gonna be gone? Not long. Hello? Hello? Hey, John. Yeah, it is. - Who's this? - How's it going? Forrest Tucker. Is that you? - I heard you got out. - Yeah, I got out all right. What happened? Did you get tired of digging tunnels and climbing fences? Well, I thought so, but, uh... Forrest? Forrest, are you all right? Yeah, I... I'm about to be. Subtitles by explosiveskull
