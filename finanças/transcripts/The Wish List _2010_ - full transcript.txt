So these, um, linen pants I need with a full crease. And then these palazzos I needed the crease starting mid-thigh. And on these cropped black pants, I need no crease at all. But if it's the silk, then it's the other way around. And on this one, it needs a button. But I don't like the parallel stitch. I like the "x." Hi, Tim. - Hey. You're right on time, as always. - Hmm. - Large nonfat half-caf latte, extra splash of caf. - Great, as always. - All right. - The job is assistant to the children's editor. - Well, I've done a lot of creative writing, and I consider myself very organized. - Oh, excellent. - And since I minored in psychology, I feel like I'm very equipped to deal with a lot of different personalities. - You know what, I think you're perfect for the job. - The peppercorn?

Three packs a day. The reason why I've been hiding it is because nonsmokers hate smokers, and I didn't want to offend you. - I had no idea. You know what? Y... You smoke. Yeah. Yeah, light up. Sure. - Ohh...that is so good. - [Coughs lightly] - Another chardonnay? - No, no, no. My limit is one. - Uh...me too. On second thought, maybe I will have another drink.

No more chasing Mr. Wrong. - No. No, Sarah. No lists. That's just way too extreme. Do you remember what pastor James said about true love when we were kids? He said "be patient. Don't be anxious or worried. God wants us to prosper, and he will deliver a love far more wonderful than we can ever dream." - I'm making a list. Qualifications for the man I'll marry. No...exceptions. One. Must love his family. Two. Must have a good job. Hi, baby. Must...love animals. Must not eat red meat. Oh. No bling. No piercings. No dreadlocks. No slogan t-shirts. Honest.

What can I do for you today? - Oh, I just need these, uh...Pfff... You know how to do it. - Yes, I do. [Knocking, door opens] - Sarah, can I have a word? - Yeah. - That applicant that you sent over for my new second assistant, the one with the crazy hair, the nose ring... - Yeah, uh, sir, uh, I know she doesn't look as traditional as some of the other assistants, but I assure you... - No, no, no, no. That's just it. Y-You usually send me these perky Ivy league types. This girl...She was a breath of fresh air. She was unique, creative, thinks out of the box. - That's terrific, Mr. Paxton. I-I'm really glad. - Well, listen, you know, feel free to... To mix it up a little bit more around here, Sarah. All right? Boss's orders. - Mr. Paxton? Um... I was wondering if... You could take a look at some of my sketches, um...maybe consider me for illustrating one of the children's titles? - Sarah, you are so good running human resources. Why would you want to work in creative? - B-Because I am creative. - [Chuckles] [Exhales] All right. All right. [Whispers] Fine. - Thank you. - Hey! - What happened to your hair? - Nothin'. Hey, try this. - What is it? - Hot off the presses. I call it the Bella costa. Costa Rican blend, chocolate, steamed soy milk, and it just came to me... Almond syrup. Rich, smooth, buoyant. - I just got used to the sumatran sling. Can't you just make me that? - No, no, no, that... That...That's not you anymore. If I met you today, I'd give you the Bella costa. Matches your new vibe. Go. - I have a new vibe? - You have a new vibe. - Very tasty. I like it. - Am I good, or what? - Yes. Speaking of which, you know, I... Happened to see this online, and... You should enter. - [Laughs] "World barista competition"? Thanks. I know I'm the best. I don't need anyone to tell me. - Gee, you should enter the regional humility championship. You know what, why bother? Who needs 10,000 bucks in prize money anyway? Thanks for the coffee. - Wait...whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Uh...ten gs? - Winner takes all. - Huh. You know, my grammar really stinks. Maybe you could help me with the, uh, essay.

What kind of person makes a list? - Someone who is tired of dating the wrong men. Okay? Someone who wants to find someone special to spend the rest of her life with. And, yes, I'm sorry, I was being proactive, and, yes, I made a list. Shoot me. I'm tired of just sitting and watching my life pass me by. - You know what I think? I think you made the list to keep the right guys away, to not attract them, to raise the bar so high that it's impossible for anyone to measure up. - Erik measures up. - Oh, and I see you're just jumping at the chance to marry him. - I'm sorry, Fred. People don't just jump into marriage. It's actually a big decision. - You know what I think, Sarah? I think you're just like your drawings... All safe and neat and tidy and totally unwilling to take even the slightest risk. - [Sighs] Chloe, I appreciate your help. I really do. But after Fred's little meltdown, I really don't feel like making another list. - Well, too bad. Before you can even think about marrying Erik, you gotta get barista boy out of your system. - Excuse me! Barista boy was never in my system. - Tell that to somebody you didn't share a bedroom with for 12 years, 'Kay? - Okay, fine, maybe Fred was in my system a teeny, tiny, miniscule bit, but not enough for this.

I'm sorry if my list offended you. - So you and the e-man doing the "for better or for worse" thing? - Yes, we are. - Well, isn't that just super-fantastic? Have you told him about your little list? Oh! You haven't told the dude, have you? - It's none of your business. - Well, it is his business, especially if you're gonna be Dr. and Mrs. Perfect. - You're just as bitter as your coffee, Fred. Have a nice life. - Just check... Check this out. Just for the heck of it, I called the calamigos. Seems they just had a wedding party cancel. Bride got cold feet or something. So now the banquet room, you know the one with the wraparound windows that look over the beach? Well, it's now available for Saturday night, February 1st. - Ha! Feb-feb-February! This...next... This February? - Yeah. Exactly. - Two months? - Well, what are we waiting for? Sooner the better, right? - Yes, but... What about, um... The engagement party and the pear tree? - Well, you said the pear tree wasn't available for the wedding till next summer, right? And there's certainly no need to have an engagement party if the big party's only two months away. - Yeah, I suppose. I-I just...But... - But what? Come on, Sarah, it's perfect. Look, we can get married, we'll spend two amazing weeks in Tahiti and be back in time for your folks' anniversary. As Dr. and Mrs. Erik cavallieri. - Mm...ha... - I just... I can't wait for us to start our life together. - So should... I call and book the calamigos, or should you? - It's already done. [Laughs] Sweetie, it's gonna be great. I just...I hope I didn't mess up your list. - Oh, yeah, you did. [Weak laugh] - Erik... There's something I should probably show you... Before anything, though. - Well, y... - Ah. - I mean, y-you have to... You have to... - No, it's, uh... No, uh...Ah. "Must love animals." That's good, right, buddy? "No slogan t-shirts. Must have nice feet." Boy, you are, uh, thorough. - Look, you're the only one that ever even came close to being a perfect score, you know? But that's not the reason why I'm marrying you, of course. - Whatever. No, it's... I'm deeply flattered. And it's darn lucky I threw away that "surgeons do it with heart" t-shirt. - So you're not offended? You...you... - Don't be silly. - You sure? - It's adorable. It's totally you. It's totally why I love you. - Really? - There are so many details to think about when it comes to your wedding. I can only suggest. The major choices are between you two. - Well, actually, Erik and I are...Are... Are really clear about, you know, what we want, so um... Thanks. - [Singsong] Leave it to Sarah. Can't go anywhere without her list. - That's my daughter. The most organized gal on two feet. - Well, organized is one thing, as long as the bride and groom are on the same page. Otherwise, it's just chaos. - Well, you don't have to worry about us. Sarah and I agree on just about everything, don't we, sweetie? - Uh-huh. - Okay, shall we start on the menu? - All right. First of all, no red meat, and nothing endangered... We're very adamant about that. - Okay. Then might I sugg... - So we're thinking a choice of either wild salmon or free-range chicken breast, right, honey? - You know, I-I don't know. I was thinking that, um, you know, a lot of people do like red meat, so... Maybe we can offer filet mignon too. - Baby, that's... That's very different than what we talked about. - I know, but... Different is okay, right? Make everyone happy. - Okay, yeah. Filet mignon too. But only grass-fed organic. Try hearst ranch up in San simeon. - Well, we usually order from organic pastures in riverside. - Do they guarantee no subtherapeutic antibiotics in the meat? - Pfft! Good point! We'll order from hearst. - Why don't we go on to centerpieces? Um, you know what, I-I sketched out just a few concepts. - You didn't mention that. - Yeah, just some simple drawings I did. - Oh, yeah! No, sweetie, you're right. These, uh... They're...They're simple. I mean, I thought we were gonna go for something more elaborate than this. - You're right, of course. Of course, yeah. - Erik, maybe these are more to your liking. Personally, I love this third one. - Oh...my. - Huh? - [Chuckling] - Are those...Those bird cages? - Yeah! It's so much better than a plain old vase. Plus, it can hold three times the flowers. - Bird cages. How unique. - Yeah. Actually, I thought... - Do these come silver-plated? - Silver, gold. Whatever you like. And we can have them bursting with a melange of Autumn flowers. - So like some calla lilies, dahlias, and delphiniums? - Agapanthus, blue irises. [Gasps] I know...Grape hyacinths! - Yes! Oh, and one giant cymbidium orchid smack in the middle, just towering over all of them. - Erik, that is genius! - That's my future son-in-law. [Echoing] - Erik, darling, is there anything you don't know? - Sarah, you have quite a catch here. You two are gonna be so happy. [Voice distorting, echoing] I just said I think you two are gonna be so happy. - Sarah...you all right? - I'm okay. - Honey, what is it? - Oh... - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Oh! Oh! - [Breathing heavily] I just... I can't breathe. - I'm taking her to the hospital. [Echoing] - Oh... - How's my girl, Pete? - Well, her vital signs are fine, and all her tests came back negative. I'd say what you experienced was... Simply a reaction to stress. - Stress? I-I couldn't breathe. - No, sweetie, hyperventilation's often a result of stress. - Sarah, are you particularly anxious about anything right now? - No, we were just sitting with our wedding planner, talking about food and flowers. All of a sudden, she couldn't breathe. - Joanie had such commitment anxiety, she'd throw up if she even looked at a wedding dress. - I don't have commitment anxiety. Tell him I-I don't have commitment anxiety. - Well, let's just be glad if that's all it was. Right, Erik? - Absolutely. Thanks for the second opinion, pal. - Can't be too sure about these things, right? - It's a big decision, Fred. It's not just, you know, go get married. It's actually a big decision. - You know what I think, Sarah? I think you're just like your drawings... All safe and neat and tidy and totally unwilling to take even the slightest risk. - "Fred Jones, number ten." [Gasps] Oh... [Keys clacking] Print. - [Playing harmonica] - Thanks for telling me you're in the barista contest! - Ho ho ho. Pardon "ez moi." I was too busy "having a nice life," which in my book means you wanted me to get lost. - Well, in my book, it doesn't mean that. I guess we go by different books. - I guess so. - So I just wanted to wish you good luck. So...good luck. Okay, I had a panic attack. So maybe you were right. I, um...Was... I-I was... Maybe a little bit commitment-phobic. So I just wanted to tell you that. So...how's practice going? - For what? - The contest. - I'm not...I'm not doing the contest. - Why not? Fred, it's... Fred, this is silly. You're so good at this. You make people happy. And that makes you happy, so... And it's $10,000, so... You should do it. - I'll think about it. [Paper rustling] [Numbers beeping] [Line ringing] - Oh, Mr. Paxton. Um... Sorry. Hi. Um, I have some new sketches I wanted to show you. - Sarah, really, I don't think that... - Please? - You did these? I'll get back to you. - Great. - Go, Fred, go, Fred, go, Fred, go, Fred... - Would you stop that? You're ruining my concentration. - Sorry, bro. - Yes, here we go. 12 perfect espressos. [Both laughing] - How we doing? How we doing? - 9:17. - How we doing? - 6:01! [Machine whirring] - Time. - 6:17. - Feels nice. Let's get it right on it. - Shakespeare, let me see. - That's perfect.

Thank you. Thank you, uh... Thank you to the west coast regional invitational barista championship for this incredible honor and for this huge wad of cash. I, uh, I promise not to spend it wisely. [Laughter] I also, uh, wanna thank someone who not only pushed me to enter this competition but someone who is also the inspiration behind one of my winning specialty drinks. You see, when we first met, I took one look at her and I thought, I don't have a chance in the world with this woman, but I sure know what kinda coffee she needs. And so the sumatran sling and a special friendship was born... And I just wanna say that I've really missed that friendship. So Sarah fischer, take yourself a bow. - It's so exciting. - Congratulations. - See ya. - Wow! - Ha ha ha ha. - Look at you. Well... You should congratulate me. - Wait. Aren't you supposed to congratulate me? - I-I called off my wedding. - No way. - Yes way. - Well, uh... What happened? Dr. Perfect wasn't so perfect after all? - No, actually, um... He's pretty perfect. I just realized that, uh, what I wanted was, um...someone... Imperfect. - Is that so? - So I was wondering if, uh... You knew anyone imperfect that you could introduce me to. - Mm. Well, what about your list? - It's on the list. It's just...It's... A lot shorter. You wanna hear it? - I don't know, do I? - It says... Must love the guy more than... Anything in the world. - That's it? - That's it. - What about the guy loving you more than anything else in the world too?
