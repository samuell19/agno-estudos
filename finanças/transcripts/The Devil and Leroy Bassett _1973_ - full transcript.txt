You're full of crap Leroy, you know that? You and your smart ass ideas. - Hell Wilbur, everybody knows they caught him here. Leroy said he saw the-- - Shut your mouth Melvin. Aint nobody talking to you. - All I'm saying is Harold Dean's a liar. Always has been. Just because he sweeps up at the jail don't mean no shit. (burps) - Give me another one of them beers. - You've had enough Wilbur. - You've had enough Wilbur. You've had enough Wilbur. Melvin, I say you give me one of them damn beers. Ow! Ow Leroy! Ow, you're hurting me. - I know that Wilbur. The Lord meant for brothers to love one another. And I love you. But I'll hurt you bad if you don't do like I say. Now we can't let nothing keep us from delivering our brother Keema from his enemies. - He aint no brother of mine. Ow! - [Leroy] He saved our life in the mine that time! - Okay! - [Leroy] God said he would save us and in God's eyes, he became our brother. - Okay, okay damn it. Just let go. Damn it Leroy, you don't have to be so mean about it. I'm just tired of sitting here. We've been waiting here over two hours now. How the hell do we know if this is the right road or not? - It has to be Wilbur. It's the only road into town from the west. Chavez has got to go by here. - It's in God's hands. - In God's hands. Oh come on Leroy, knock it off. I'm sick and tired of your phony religious horse shit. Now what did God ever do for you huh? He ever give you any money? Did he ever get you laid? (laughing) Did you ever buy you a big shiny car? (laughing) Hell Leroy, if there was a God and he loved you how come he made you some damned ugly. - You shut your dirty filthy mouth Wilbur or I'll kill you right here, right now. You blaspheme God again you'll put the mark of pain on me forever. - Okay, okay damn it just let go. Damn it Leroy. You tore my shirt. - You're a sinful man Wilbur but God is good. He forgives sinners. I'll ask him to forgive you. Yeah, that's what I'll do. Right now. I'm gonna ask God to forgive you Wilbur. God? It's me, Leroy. Leroy Bassett. You know I don't bother you unless it's something important. I just want you to know that my brother Wilbur here didn't mean-- - Leroy. Look. - God be praised. You see Wilbur? God is good. He's already forgiven you. (upbeat bluegrass music) - You were right Leroy. They sure as hell came to get Keema. - Big deal, so they're here. I still don't see how them being here is gonna help us get Keema out of jail. - We aint gonna get Keema out of jail. - We aint? Then why the hell did we drive 400 miles for if we aint gonna get him? - I didn't say we wasn't gonna go get him. I said we aint gonna get him outta jail. Chavez is gonna do that for us then we gonna get him from Chavez. - Oh I see. We just gonna walk up to old Chavez and we're gonna say thank you to him? - No. Just gonna drive right up behind him. Blink a little old red light on a nice shiny police car. - You know something Leroy? You're crazy. You're just dumb-dumb crazy. Now where the hell are we gonna get us a police car? - God may have made you the oldest Wilbur but he sure didn't make you the smartest. - You know mama always said his brain shrunk from the fever she had just-- - You make him stop picking on me. I'm gonna bust him good now I mean it. Make him stop talking about me that way. - Stop, stop both of you. We've got more important things to be doing than sitting here and fighting between ourselves. - I still wonder where we gonna get a police car. (laughs) - Hell Wilbur, that's the easiest thing in the world to get. (coughing) - I hope you're satisfied Leroy. My ass is almost froze off from sitting here all night. - God said be patient. Patience is knowledge. You aint got neither one of them Wilbur. - How you know he said that? Huh? How you know he said that Leroy? You show me where he said that. You just show me. - I'll show you my tattoo Wilbur. - You can't do it can you? You can't show me that anymore than you can tell me where we're gonna get a police car. God gonna give you that police car Leroy? - I told you last night to not make fun of God Wilbur. Now I mean it. - Aint making fun of nobody. I just wonder where we're gonna get a police car. - God will provide. - I'd rather he provide us with something to eat. - Oh stop your bitching Wilbur. If it wasn't for Keema, you'd be worm crap by now. - Hell, I'm just starving Leroy. You know I get them damn bad headaches when I don't eat. - That aint from not eating Wilbur. That's from pulling your putt. (laughs) - If you don't shut your mouth Melvin I'm gonna bust you good. I mean it. - Both of you stop that. (clucking) - Hell you know this is stupid Leroy. I think we ought to go home. Besides, I don't feel good. - As the Lord said all good things come to them that wait. (upbeat bluegrass music) - Sergeant Chavez we have extradition papers from New Mexico for Keema Greywolf. - Right, we've been expecting you. It will take a few minutes to get him signed over to you. He's a strange one. Aint had too many Indians in here before. They all like him? - Nope. Some of us bathe and eat with a knife and fork. - I didn't mean... - It's alright, forget it. I know what you mean. He's a breed all to himself alright. - He hasn't said a word since he's been here. Just stares. You know? He gives me the creeps. (chuckles) - Melvin, hand me one of those beers. - These are all warm Leroy. - I didn't ask you that Melvin. I said hand me one. - Well if you can have one, I can have one too. - Aint nobody said nothing about having one. You know I don't drink Wilbur. - Well then what do you want it for? - Boy you are dumb Wilbur. - Now I'm getting sick and tired of you calling me dumb Leroy. If you aint gonna drink it there aint nothing else you're gonna do with it. - You been wanting to know how we gonna get that police car aint you? - Uh-huh. - Okay. I'm gonna trade a policeman this nice, warm beer for a nice, shiny police car. - You know it took six of our men to get him into a cell? - I can believe it. When he was about 14 a couple kids jumped him. He nearly beat them to death. When we went after him, he took off for the mountains in the dead of winter. Everyone figured he froze to death. A couple months later two deer hunters came upon some tracks. A deer's and a man's. Seems that somebody tracked and ran a deer until it dropped. Dressed it out and carried off about 150 pounds of meat. Keema's the only one it could have been. - Well he can talk can't he? - He can talk alright. When he wants to. Matter of fact, better than you and I. - How you doing there officer? I'm on my way home, I got kind of lost. Looking for highway 19. - Just down here about two blocks. Turn left, then right at the bridge. You can't miss it. - Thank you, thank you very much. (upbeat bluegrass music) That's it old buddy, you're doing just fine. (laughs) Wilbur, check the glove compartment. Give me my darts. Now you damn fool. I said reach up there, hand me the gun, now sit up. (upbeat bluegrass music) (police sirens) Just put your arms up, get on over. I'll put little holes in your belly. Melvin, reach out to get his gun. Okay old buddy, back up. We're gonna take a ride in your pretty police car. You two get out of there. Get over here, undress him now. (laughing) (dramatic music) - Keema. Keema! - Alright you, get up against the wall there. (yelling) Have you seen any bodies yet? (laughing) Shut up. Get back, get back! Okay now, see if he wanna play bad now. - Son of bitches! - Kill him! (laughing) Kill him, come on kill him. Kill him! (yelling) Kill him Indian, kill him. - Get him up boys. Hang him up over here. Alright. Now go get that belt. You know Chief, I sure wish you wasn't leaving today. Boy I'd kinda like to. (spits) Now boy, I'm gonna teach you some manners that your mammy should've taught you a long time ago. (yelling) Alright, get that belt. Get it on him and get him out of here. Get him cleaned up. You know we don't want New Mexico to think we don't care of our guests. (laughs) - Hey Leroy, Leroy look what I found. Can I wear one too. - What for? - Well Leroy, you've got one and it looks like I oughta be able to wear one too. Please Leroy? - Alright Wilbur. - Do I look good Leroy? (laughs) Thank you Leroy. - You're welcome Wilbur. - Hey we better hurry, they gonna be gone. - Yeah. We know where they're going. Melvin knows what to do. - Hey Leroy, can't we kill him? - No, we aint got time. - What do you mean we aint got time? Just give me that much time. I can pull the trigger. - Wilbur, I told you before it aint fit and proper or Christian to kill a man. Unless you got time to say words over him. Now everybody got a right to be prayed into heaven and I aint got time for me to do it right now. - But he can identify us Leroy. - So can God Wilbur. And he knows that what we gotta do is more important than sending him this here sinner. Now get in that trunk, okay let's go. - They said in the charges he killed an officer. And shot the Sheriff also. What made him do that? - The Sheriff's stupidity. It happened the day he was married. (yelling) (yelling and laughing) - [Sheriff] Keema, Keema! - Yeah? - I know this is your wedding day and you boys are having a lot of fun but I think you've been drinking a lot too. I think you should all go back inside and have some coffee before you try to go anywhere in that car. Okay? - [Man] Everything will be fine. - Okay boys. - [Hector] Well 10 minutes later they were on patrol east of town. (upbeat rock music) (police sirens) - [Sheriff] No Keema! (gunshots) - And that's the last we heard of him until your boys picked him up here last month. - Sheriff made it okay though? - Oh yeah, Ben's a tough old bird. Been sheriff 19 years and this is the first bad trouble he's had. Who'd expect a man to kill someone over something that was his own fault? Keema. What happened to him? - He liked us so much here, he didn't want to leave. - Looks like you convinced him. - I didn't ask him to come here. - Didn't say you did. Come on Keema. Sheriff Trask wants you at home. That's right, he's alive. Thank you Sergeant. Come on Keema, let's go home. - Damn it Wilbur, shut up. I'm hungry too. - Well you don't get as hungry as me Leroy. You know what the doctor said. - He gave you medicine to take for the worms but you won't take them. - Well it tastes awful Leroy. I'd rather have the worms. Well where the hell they at? It's been over a half hour since we went by the jail. It's probably in the-- - Wilbur if you don't shut up I'm gonna hit you. And I don't want you getting me all upset. You're getting me all nervous. - Can I at least have a beer Leroy? I think that would help. - We aint got no beer. Wilbur it's in the car. - No, no it aint. Not all of it. See? - Where'd you get that beer Wilbur? - Back at the car before Melvin went to watch them at the jail. Please Leroy? - Will you shut up if I let you have it? - Mhmm. - Okay then. - Thank you Leroy. - You're welcome Wilbur. (upbeat bluegrass music) (police sirens) - What the hell is that damn for doing? I said I'm police, see what they. (gunshot) - You move Hector, and I'll send you to hell. Come on Keema. Now just sit up Hector. Real slow. Melvin, go around there and get his gun. Put your hands up there on the steering wheel and on the dash Hector. Melvin! Where the hell you at? Melvin get in here and get his gun. Damn you Melvin, hurry up. We aint got all day. - It's Wilbur Leroy. My God, his mouth. They broke out all his teeth. (gunshots) - What did you do that for Melvin? - [Melvin] Why'd they do that to Wilbur Leroy? - Go help your brother. Give me the keys for them locks on Keema. - Like I'd do that. - I'll shoot your tongue out if you don't give me them damn keys. - I don't have them, Curtis has them. - You mean he did. - Don't kill him Leroy. I want him alive. - Melvin, go get them keys. Hector said he's got them. Hurry up Melvin. I want you to get in there and unlock those locks. Okay. Now give Keema your gun and go help your brother. - I don't want you dead Chavez. So if you don't want to die don't even sweat. You just slide out of there real easy like. Come on. - You bastard, I'm gonna kill you. - Leroy, you and Melvin put those things on him. - Think you can tell us what to do. Leroy, you gonna let him tell us what? - What do we do now Keema? - We get the hell outta here. (upbeat bluegrass music) - Get the door. Watch the tail. - Later. Never again. (mumbling) - That whale has lost some weight. (phone ringing) - Sheriff's department, Deputy Miller speaking. Yeah, hold on just a minute will you? It's Rowland Duncan, wants to talk to the Sheriff. - Alright, alright. Watch this one. - Listen Rowland, hold on a minute will you? Thank you. - Huh? Dewey Fundham once asked me how do you do that? - Do you mind? - Sense of humor. Phone call Ben. - Right. - Sheriff Trask. - You should've seen the lovely young lady I was with last night. - Clay, believe me I have seen some of your young ladies. - I ask you not to tell me that. - Now Clay, do me a favor would you? Knock off the funny crap. Go see if Nechero's in his office. Tell him to get the car and meet me out front. - [Clay] Right Sheriff. - He's got more trouble over at Rowland's place? - Yeah, something's always happening in Rowland's place isn't it? That damn fool Leonard Tuttle just beat the hell out of Rowland and tore his place up again. - What's he got against Rowland? - Seems he was messing around with Leonard's sister. - You've got to be kidding me. He's old enough to be her grandfather. - Jerry, some day you might be a damn good deputy if you could only do one thing. - What's that? - Well I'd hate for you to give an identification on someone by age. - What do you mean? - Well, for your edification Deputy Miller I and Rowland were in the same graduation class and I am sure as hell not old enough to be Ethel Tuttle's grandfather. - Sheriff, I'm sorry. I didn't mean. Well hell Ben, you look at least 20 years younger than Rowland. - You know something else Jerry if bullshit was a penny a pound you'd be a billionaire. (chuckles) - [Clay] Excuse me Sheriff Frank said he'd meet you in front. - [Sheriff] Okay. - Hey what's bothering the old man? - The men I just broke up from Rowland's place again. - Happy days are here again. - You've got a long way to go. If you hurry, you might get somewhere by morning. - They're gonna hang you for sure this time Keema. - Hector. If I was you, I wouldn't push my luck. The only reason you're still alive is because I have a little message for you to take back to the Sheriff. You tell him I left on a debt and I don't like owing anybody. You tell him I don't know when I'll be there to pay him but just as sure as your being alive, I'll be there. You understand? - It's over 400 miles to home. There's a policeman for every one of those miles. You'll be stopped before you get halfway there. - Well you're one of the lucky ones. Because they're gonna be awful dead if they try. Well, you'd better get started. You don't want to get lost in the dark. Melvin. Let's go Leroy. - Afternoon Sheriff. - [Sheriff] Hi there, Lenny. Would you fill it up please? - Okay, check under the hood? - [Sheriff] No, don't bother with the hood Lenny. - [Frank] Boy, he sure tore the hell out of Rowland's. - [Sheriff] Yeah, that he did. But if you ask me, it's as much his fault as Leonards. Everybody in town knows how Leonard is about his sister. Now that's just asking for trouble. - [Frank] Well he got plenty of that. Looks like somebody hit him in the face with a skillet. - [Sheriff] If you ever took a close look at Leonard's hands you'd know it wasn't. - [Frank] What do we do now? Go out to the ranch and bring him in? - No, let's just go back to the office. I'll call old Loren and just tell him to bring him in. If we go out there somebody just might get hurt. - [Frank] I'm glad to hear you say that Ben. When he's drinking, I'm a coward too. (chuckles) - No Frank, I think it's old age catching up. I think when this term's over I'm gonna go fishing for about five years. This is a hell of a job anyway Frank. No matter what we do, we're wrong. We're damned if we do and damned if we don't. - That's for damn sure. * And the red red robin * Comes bob bob bobbin along (laughs) - You know that was pretty damn stupid you letting that stinking Hector go. You should've let me kill him. - [Leroy] Maybe we should have Keema. - You don't understand Leroy. Aint no good to kill a man if he doesn't know about it. I want the Sheriff to know I'm gonna kill him. (speaking foreign language) I want him to think about it a little bit. - Everybody gonna be looking for us when Hector gets back to town. - They are, but they're not gonna be looking for us where we're going. - You know something Frank? I just made up my mind about something. What I said before. I meant it. I've got two months left on this term, that's it. I want to enjoy life, Frank. I want to do what I want to do and go where I want to go. If I want to go in somewhere and have a drink I can without some peckerwood making it his business. Who needs this crap. (upbeat bluegrass music) - All I can tell you is that's the best damn meal I ever had at Gentile's. - I've never heard you brag about Ivan's cooking before. - Well things always taste better when they're free. - Well if you're worried about getting spoiled you can give me the $1.34 and we can pretend it never happened. - Nope. A free meal, a momentous decision of the future all in one day. No Frank, this is the day I want to remember forever. - Don't think it's gonna be too hard to do Ben. Loren and his little menage just pulled up out front. - [Keema] Can't think of anything else we'll need. - I'd like a stick of licorice Keema. Maybe they got some of that huh? - That crap aint good for you Leroy. - Well we put down whisky for Wilbur. I don't like whisky but I do like that stick licorice. - Only reason why he's getting whisky is to keep him from whining about his damn teeth. Maybe we shouldn't even do that he's singing is about as bad. - I mean he is the one that got his teeth hurt Keema. - The only thing I'm trying to get him to understand is you can't go around kicking the hell outta someone just because he feels like it. - Well hell Sheriff, minute I walked in there he started throwing pool balls. - I told you not over a week ago to stay away from there. Now what you going over there for anyway? - I just wanted to talk to him. - You see that Leonard? That's a telephone. If all you wanted to do was to talk to him why didn't you use the phone? Leonard, what am I gonna do with you? You want to go back to jail again? - Boy, Mr. Trask asked you a question. Now hot God damn, you answer him. - Well Leonard? Do you want me to put you back there in one of them cells again? - No. - Loren, I'm gonna let him go home with you and the missus. He'll have to come here when the judge sets a date for the hearing. Unless I can get Rowland to listen to reason. I think I can if Leonard will make restitution. - What's that mean? - Pay for the damages. - Well now according to Clyde Louis he told me that Rowland broke them windows himself throwing balls at my boy. - It wouldn't have happened if he hadn't gone over there in the first place. Now Leonard, I'm gonna let you go home with your folks. But I'm telling you now if you get into any more trouble I'm gonna lock you up and throw away the key. Do you understand? Loren. I think if you keep him home and keep him busy he won't have time to get into trouble. - I sure will do that Sheriff. I surely will. I appreciate it. We had a cattle pulled down by wolves the last week. The only way to stop him is putting out traps. And I can't do that by myself. Thank you Sheriff. Boy, thank the Sheriff and let's go home. - Clay you are really strange. - Go ahead Jer. - You spend half an hour brushing those boots and the minute you get outside you're gonna be covered in mud and sludge anyway. Who's gonna know that they're brushed? - Beauty is as beauty does. - Well Beauty, you and Jerry hold the fort. We should be back by the time Hector gets here. - Oh. Jerry? - What? - What was the name of the town you came from in Kansas? - Concordia? - Yeah, I thought that was it when I read an article about it in the paper today. - [Jerry] What article? - I can't remember the whole thing. Something about the why Christ couldn't be born there. - Oh come on man. Not another one of your cruddy jokes. - Jerry it's the truth. - Okay why couldn't Christ have been born in Concordia, Kansas? - Couldn't find three wise men or virgins. (laughing) (coughing) - What's the matter with you Wilbur? Melvin, go and put your brother in the car. And take that bottle of whisky away from him. - You touch my bottle, I'll kill you. You leave me alone. - Damn you Wilbur. - Hi Chief. How about a little drinky-poo? (yodeling) - Put him in the car. (crying) It's the right road. About 75, 80 miles. - Keema! Keema! * Let me live on the mountain * Let your sun shine on me * I'm going down * In a road out of town * Aint no day gonna end on me * Till I'm free * Let me go where the wind goes * See my shadow on the snow * Aint no tears aint no pain * Aint no balls aint no chains * Gonna put their hold on me * I am free * I am free * See the smoke on the mountain * See the rain in the trees * Let me fly like a bird * Hear my song hear my words * Let the sound of the wind dance free * Snow on me * When I feel the warm roads * What's inside never settles * Let the world that I hope to see * Come to me * come on to me Keema. Keema! - Keema. Keema. Which one? - The right. About five miles up there's a turn off in the canyon area. Take that one. (phone ringing) - County Sheriff's department. Deputy Hoover speaking sir. Hey Hector, where you been? We expect-- Oh my God, no. - [Leroy] What do we do now Keema? - Yeah, what do we do now Keema? We done got our asses strung out 40 miles on account of you. Well you're a real big man. I know a place nobody knows of but me. - We're gonna drive up there and drill the door-- - You said there wasn't anybody here this time of year. - Shut your mouth Wilbur. I'll take care of it okay? So I was wrong. (upbeat bluegrass music) - Get inside old man. I'll blow your dust through your hole. Get inside! - Please Mister, we weren't doing anything wrong. We didn't know anybody lived here. We're trespassing on these people's property. - What are you doing here on Double O property? - We didn't know it was anybody's property. We thought-- - Well you thought wrong old man. - Yes sir, yes sir we did. We were just fixing to move on. - Anybody else here? - Just us and our daughter Twila. - Get out an APV to the highway patrol. Alert all state units. Jerry, you make sure that those alerts are out to all surrounding states. Clay, what else did Hector say? - Only what I told you. That Curtis is dead and Keema says he owes you. - Frank, get the state commissioner on the phone. See if they can get us some backup down here as soon as possible. I want every road into town blocked by morning. I want one of our men on every road. Someone who knows the Bassetts or Keema by sight. I want every unknown vehicle searched. Even if it's a hay wagon, shake it down. - Then you think it will be alright? Us staying here? - [Leroy] Well, I know it's warm in here but you don't seem to have done any great amount of damage. So I guess it won't hurt for a while. Hey, you are a Christian folk aint you? - We surely are. Assembly of God. I'm a deacon. - [Leroy] Assembly of God. Well praise the Lord for the child. That's the thing, hardly any better folks than that. At least not that I know of. - Girly, bring me some more of them beans. That girl of yours sure is short on manners Mister. - It aint that, she's a mute. - You trying to treat me like I'm stupid or something Mister? - No sir, I'm not. Not at all. - Then you don't you go telling me she's no Yute. Aint no damned Indian ever belonging looking like that. - No sir, you got me wrong. I didn't say Yute. I said she was a mute. That means, deaf and dumb. She can't hear or talk. - I know what it means old man. You just didn't say the word plain when you said it. You trying to make me look stupid. - He couldn't do that Wilbur. - You shut your mouth Melvin. - Well he couldn't Wilbur. You was born looking like that. (yelling) - If you don't stop picking at your brother I'm gonna let him hurt you. Just leave him alone. - He aint got any right talking to me that way Leroy. I'm his older brother. He didn't treat me like that. You know, he's always saying things about me like that that aint so. Leroy. Will you tell him to be nice to me please? - I will Wilbur. Go on in there and lay down now. - He shouldn't do that when I'm hurt the way I am. Leroy, my teeth ache. They're hurting me something awful. - I know Wilbur. Now you just go on in there and get some rest. - You're awful good to me Leroy. - You're my brother Wilbur and I love you. - Thank you Leroy. - You're welcome Wilbur. You're gonna get whipped if you don't leave him alone. - I was only having fun with him Leroy. - I hope you won't think I'm interfering but I've done a lot of vet work. I got some of the medicine. Some of it works just as good on humans. - [Leroy] Well it aint like he was really sick you know. His horse threw him and hit his teeth on a post. You know, it broke them pretty bad. - Teeth aint much different whether it being on a man or a horse. Might be I could help. - [Leroy] Well I certainly appreciate it Brother Zornes. That's very Christian of you. - Was it not the Lord, Brother Bassett that says, "I am my brother's keeper"? (country music) * If that phone call's for me * I'm not here * You can say you haven't seen me for a long time * That it's been a while * Since I've been through the door * And from now on when she calls me - Waldo. You just got out. Aren't you ever going to learn? - I'm gonna stop. I need a beer. - Right Waldo. * And she's forced me to many a deal * If that phone call's for me I'm not here (country western music) (burps) - Get scared old man? Shit. - Bang bang Sheriff. - That could have gotten you killed Arch. (laughing) - Has she always been deaf and dumb? - Yes Brother Bassett. She was born with her silence. Sometimes I think God did it to keep her unaware of the evils and violence of this world. To keep her pure. - Does she know of our Lord? - Yes, she's read his book through many times. Woman, get those couple of rabbits on the back stoop I shot yesterday and have the girl skin them down for supper tonight. - [Melvin] I'll give her a hand Mrs. Zornes. - Oh thank you son, you're very kind. Melvin sure is a nice boy Mr. Bassett. Twila seems quite taken with him. - That he is Sister Zornes. Maybe not quite as God fearing as he should be. But he's young yet. - Oh my gosh. Leroy, I hurt. I hurt bad. - I know Wilbur. Look, I told you last night Brother Zornes here is a doctor. Why don't you let him take a look at your teeth for you? - He aint no damn doctor. Aint no damn horse shoer is gonna poke around in my mouth. - Some of them teeth gonna have to be pulled. I'd be beholden to you if you can do it brother. - I can do it but you're gonna have to tie him down. It aint gonna feel good when they come out. He's gonna fight like a de-testicled wolf. - Wilbur, would that there bottle of whisky make you feel better? - No, I don't think it would. I think the best thing is what we're doing now. Yes sir, I will. Thanks again. (knocking) I didn't know so many Indians to ride around on the white man's land. - I didn't know there were. - There's over 50 sightings in the last 24 hours. Some as far as Nebraska. - All on their own of course. * She's my little sugar booger * Everybody wants to hug her * But she only puckers for me - Girly come here, I've got something to show you. You gonna like it. You're gonna learn how to make all kinds of sounds. Come here, come here. Come here girly. God damn it, leave the dumb milk pail. Get your ass up here. (upbeat bluegrass music) Now right here, if I don't do everything just right. You just speak up. (chuckles) (groaning) - [Melvin] Damn you Wilbur. (yelling) - [Wilbur] Leroy! Leroy! - I told you to leave your brother alone. (yelling) - The Lord looks down on you Wilbur. He's gonna send you straight to hell. (crying) - Knock it off Leroy. I wasn't gonna do nothing that somebody shouldn't have done a long time ago. - You're a vile man Brother Bassett. - You shut your mouth you bald-headed old fart. Stop calling me brother. I aint no kin to no trash like you. - You hush your mouth Wilbur. - No I don't have to. I'm getting sick and tired of everybody telling me what to do all the time. You said you was gonna have my teeth fixed too and you didn't. You always want me to do everything you say and you don't do nothing you say. To hell with you. - We're gonna fix your teeth right now Wilbur. - What? - That's what we were coming to do. - What the hell you doing Leroy? No Leroy! No please! No! No! Oh my God! - Hallelujah Lord! Did you hear Brother Zornes? My brother Wilbur here called out to the Lord. Let's thank the Lord. - It's gonna give me great pleasure Brother Bassett to look back on this day and know that I had a hand in your brother's conversion. (yelling) (police sirens) - [Jerry] Sorry Sheriff, false alarm. Somebody that matched his truck. It was clean so we sent him on his way. - That's okay, I don't want any dead heroes. Anything that doesn't look right or you think you need some help on get the backup out here pronto. - [Jerry] No sign of them anywhere Sheriff? - No, nothing. - [Jerry] I heard they fell off a cliff somewhere. - No, we couldn't be that lucky. Jerry, I want you and Trujillo to go into Clay Center. Pick up another and we're going to down to Orangeville. They may just try to come in that way now that the weather's clear. Frank, you get Osterman on the radio. Tell him to pick up Hector and come on out here. We'll wait here with Clay until they get here. - Hey time to go Wilbur. They feeling any better? - Some. But my God Leroy, it just ruined the hell out of my look. - It aint that bad. We'll get you some false teeth. They look just as good. - Yeah. They might look good but they probably just keep falling down like mama's did. (chuckles) Leroy. You remember that time at Aunt Lily's when she sneezed at the table and they fell on top of the cake? (laughing) Leroy, that was funny. (laughing) - Fell out her God damn teeth. She had to like to die. (laughing) (coughing) - Brother Bassett, Brother Leroy? - [Keema] I told you to get in the truck old man. - What does this mean Brother Leroy? - [Keema] It means get in there now. - Now Brother Zornes, aint no reason for you to fret. - But what? - Now, you're gonna drive the camper. And if anybody stops us you just be very careful about what you say and do. Nobody gonna get hurt. Just if anybody wants to start some trouble in the back of it you tell them you lost the keys. - But what? - But what your ass old man. Now you do what you're told or I'm gonna blow you to hell. - Where we going? - To hell brother. (laughs) We're going to hell!

I'm sending you my brother. My fine Christian brother. Melvin struck down while doing your work. Take him from me. I said pray damn you. Here lies this fine Christian boy killed by sinners. Everyone here has been good to the Lord. And only sinners blaspheme while I pray. You all want God to take me to a blaspheming? You want him to look at you and see this? Huh? Then pray damn it pray! Oh Lord, hear our plea. Take him into your heart and love him as we do. What's that? What? Oh yes Lord. Yes I hear you now Lord. Yes I hear you Lord. Yes Lord thank you. Thank you Lord. Hallelujah!
