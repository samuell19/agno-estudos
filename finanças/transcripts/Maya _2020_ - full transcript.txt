1) The supernatural power owned by gods and demons to create illusions. 2)Hinduism/Buddhism: Concept of illusion, that constitutes the nature of the universe. Adriana Dri! Adriana! Who's talking? Who's talking? It's Ícaro, Adriana's boyfriend. It's Ícaro, Adriana's boyfriend. Look, I’ll hang up the phone. I don’t want to wake my husband up. He goes to work very early tomorrow. I recognize your voice. Did you take any medication? Listen young man, I’m hanging up. I don't know any Ícaro and I only have one son. No daughters... ...and definitely not one named Adriana. Your daughter Adriana, who’s in your beach house in São Sebastião. I'm with her! Well, I was with her. She’s missing, she… disappeared. Are you saying you're in my house? In my beach house? POLICE STATION SÃO SEBASTIÃO CITY Ok then, Mr. Ícaro Santos. Just confess what you’ve drank, smoked and snorted and we can go on from there For your luck, your case is not that complicated, yet. You broke into a house but without robbery or damaging anything, as what it seems. I can let you out with a record, but I need, I demand the truth. That house belongs to Adriana’s parents and she’s my girlfriend. They are accusing me of breaking in but they know me. They know me. Is it some kind of joke? Cos it’s not funny. Of course it’s not funny. Look, there’s a big holiday coming... ...with tourists come the burglars to commit crimes... I gotta get prepared for it. I have a lot to do instead of wasting my time with some lunatic. They are, they are Adriana's parents! They fucking aren’t! I called them. They have an only son named Airton. And never ever saw your face. But tell me, you got in without a key, nothing. How did you do it? Ok, if it’s not a joke it must be a nightmare, a nightmare! And if this is a nightmare, I want Adriana to walk into that door and explain what’s going on! Please, sit down. Sit down! Boy, you might have taken some heavy drugs huh? Or you’re probably a psycho. I’m gonna ask for toxicological exams. Hey, Raquel? Call someone to collect a blood sample from this Icaro. Urgent! Yeah, the thing here is complicated. Yeah. I, I can prove it. I can prove that I know the couple, the owners of the house. I can prove that I know their son. I can give information that no one else would have have but someone close to them. Really, nowadays? With Facebook, internet and other shit like it. People make public what they read in their toilet, what would it prove? That you’ve been investigating, spying and stalking the family, nothing else. You really don’t believe, do you? You don’t believe that Adriana really exists. No. You may be innocent. Maybe she told you it was her house... She can be a mythomaniac. But if that's the situation, where is she? I do not know, I do not know, I do not know, I told you that I don't know. She was in an astral projection and disappeared. Was that. Oh, what? Spirits from other plans came... ...and took her away from this joke, is it right? It's not a joke. Dude, I'll be nice to you. I’m not gonna lock you up but I’ll leave you there... ...on that couch. It’s much more than a junkie deserves, right? Meanwhile I’m gonna get your blood sample and investigate this Adriana girl. But look, there’s a camera here, me and Raquel are keeping an eye on you. Don’t even think about hanging yourself with your pants or something like that. Why would I do that? Psychosis, drugs, walking side by side with suicide attempts. Now, gimme everything you got about Adriana... Name, physical description, birthplace, where she went to school, work… and don’t hesitate. As I told you, I have a lot more to do. Coffee? Thanks. I've got bad news for you. There are only two possibilities in your case: psychosis or drugs. Why? There’s no Adriana Mattos. At least not your Adriana, according to your description and biography. Nothing in the system or the web. None of the contacts you mentioned know anything about Adriana. And most of them, not even you. It's not possible. My sister. They were friends! We contacted your sister. She’s coming over to try to help you She even asked us not to tell your parents... Your mom has hypertension or something like that, right? Yeah. She didn’t even knew you were here in Sao Sebastião and didn’t know any Adriana... ...or any girlfriend you’ve had since the passing of your ex ...who you dated when lived abroad. - Clarice. - What? Clarice. It's the name of my ex who died. Do you wanna change your testimony, kid? We have pictures together, online. If you let me use the internet I can show you. Convinced now? Cos I am. I do not believe you're innocent or the victim of a mythomaniac girl. You’re really troubled, kid. This is all a dream, A very, very bad dream. A dream So, everything that happened today The police station, me, the Raquel The police car that took you from the house you’ve broken into It’ll all disappear, like a dream, that’s it? Maybe not. Maybe not. Perhaps you are thought-forms accessed by me... ...created by others, in parallel with those we see as truth. IT IS. Thought-forms? Yes. You are in the world of ideas. But there was an origin before them, a cause. And so, a consequence in the physical world. You are real, Not here, but you're real. Dude, you really believe in this stuff, don't you? You're really nutts. Unless, unless her history has been erased. But why not in me? Before I decide if I should lock you up in a mental hospital or in jail or if I let your sister deal with you... ...wanna tell me more about your story with Adriana? Why would I do that? The best way to recognize a lie, or to surrender the truth, is making people talk, talk in details. Maybe you’ll convince me you’re innocent and not someone having fun on our costs. The snack bar you told us you’ve been many times with Adriana, nobody recognized your picture there. I can tell. I can tell in details since the day we met And it was right here in São Sebastião. And when was that? A year ago... One year and two months ago. I had just got my degree in cinema and came here to research for a film I was planning to make Well, actually I’m still planning it. I was alone, bored as hell, without any inspiration, reading on the beach. Wow! Finally I’m meeting another person who reads this book. Oh, I found it at the bookstore earlier. I went there looking for comics and there weren’t any, and I liked the book, the author too. I’m still trying to figure out about the dreams, that everything is a dream. Comics? So you're a nerd You don’t have to be one to enjoy comics, right? Not if you were about 12 or 13 years old. Not your case, right? No but I must admit I am a bit of a Peter Pan But, I'm fine about it. Spielberg’s like this too and we work with the same stuff. Spielberg? Are you a filmmaker too? Almost that. I got me degree a couple years ago, by the countryside and I’ve got only small jobs and workshops since then. But I do not give up easily. Yeah, I know what it's like. I’ve just got my degree in fashion design and got only small jobs for me as well. I’m actually working as a hostess. - Hostess? What is it? - People say it’s a fancy name for a door girl. Sounds cool. Is it here in São Sebastião? On here? No, there aren’t nightclubs for it. In Campinas, where I live. So you're, like, on vacation? Jeez, a well deserved vacation. My parents got a house around here and I always come. This time I’m all by myself but I’m having fun alone. Wow, a house around here. Yeah, since I was child. The mosquitos should know me already. I mean, not the same mosquitos as they have short lives. But if there’s some kind of mosquito reincarnation, they probably know me. And what can I expect from the book? This book. It’s a book by a Spanish physicist. A kind of updated plagiarism from another book called Holographic Universe. They’re cool, if you dig the subject. They’re terrible for religious fanatics, like my parents who are evangelic. What about you? Are you an atheist? No, I’m gnostic or agnostic, something like that. What about you? I would say confused, just like you. Well, I’m leaving you alone to read your book. My mother always tells me not to talk to strangers, But I'm stubborn. Oh, wait there. It's just ... It's not the first time I've come here... ...I've already been to Ilhabela and I stopped by, but... I’d like to know if you can advise me of some beaches... ...more obscure ones, I don’t know. Obscure? Advise or take you there? Well, I’m not too good with paths, but I got a car, you wouldn’t get too tired. A Car? How will I know that you’re not a stalker or a psycho? Well, I’ve once read an article about the professions with larger tendencies to psychopathy... ...and businessmen and lawyers were up there And us from arts, down there. I gotta check this article. I show you. But just think, how many crimes do you see in the news... ...involving people from the cinema, for example? Writers, filmmakers, actors? Zero. But you’re still fresh in this thing, right? I told her a lie. I knew well São Sebastião and also the beach she took me to. So, our only realities are made by our own brain... ...as if we took all the signs around us and put them in an internal blender ...projecting out some kind of hologram, having then what we call reality. According to this theory nothing would be really real. But what about space and time? They would not exist. How come? They would not exist. What is time after all? Ah, a measuring system, maybe. To measure what? Happenings, events, whatever, the minimum aging of the cells... ...or great social and environmental changes. The holographic universe is made of images and shadows. It's complicated to explain, you know, I'm an enthusiast of theory, I'm not a believer. It's all so crazy. Yeah, totally. Like Hamlet said There are more things in heaven and earth Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. Yeah. And when it's about all of this being a dream... ...I believe it can be a dream shared between gods or minds. So, what my night dreams would be? Dreams inside a dream? Yes, but we know it’s not a night dream for a detail only. Do you know what it is? What? Listen! What? Everything! When we are dreaming we only need the necessary sounds for the development of the story, you know. Like the thunder rumble, or whatever, suddenly, a TV on. We do not have all those ambient sounds around. At least not in my dreams. I use it a lot to know when I am awake and when I am dreaming. And to stay lucid inside my dreams It’s funny, because in my dreams there’s always some dog barking in distance, you know. But just to try to understand. If I dream that I'm dreaming what is it? Like a Hamlet play inside another play? Yeah, kind of. Dude, you’re really into Hamlet, huh? I’m actually trying to change your opinion about me being a nerd who likes Marvel and DC. Oh, and by quoting Shakespeare I’m gonna think you’re super cult. That's the idea, maybe. And..? We'll see. That’s what I call crazy weather. Sun, rain. My hair’s all wet. Wow, such a nice house. Like it? My parents bought it when they still had money ...nowadays they don’t even come here anymore. It’s always empty... ...but there’s a caretaker who comes once in a while. So it's like ... This house is more yours than theirs nowadays? Mine and my older brother's, actually. We alternate. When I leave he comes. And we respect this distance from each other. I see. So, what shall we do? Film? Drinks? It wasn’t what I had in mind when I brought you here tonight. Have you ever done astral projection in your life? What? Astral projection. When we transcend our physical body to hang around in some other plans out there. - Are you serious? - Are you telling me you don’t believe? I believe it might be some kind of self hypnosis. I’ve been making astral projections for a long time and I can prove it’s not self hypnosis. How's that? Do you like the Game of Thrones books? Yeah, I’ve read them all. Great, I brought some, for rainy days like this. Wait, I'll be right back. A Storm of Swords. You know, right? I’ve read this one like, three years ago. You’ll read it again. Choose any chapter, any part you want. Just leave in the right page. How’s it going to prove that projections are real? Very simple. I’ll go up to my room, gonna lay down and get in trance. I’ll leave my physical body, come here and read exactly what you’re reading After that I’ll be able to describe exactly which page was it. You’ll know I was here. Speaks seriously. There’s a camera here, there and there..? You’re such a suspicious guy, aren’t you? Choose any other spot of the house then. And well, what a hell of a camera it should be to focus the small characters in here. Okay, okay, I'll try to keep an open mind. But what do I have to do? Relax, it’ll take about 20 or 30 minutes... ...but you won’t see me here. Bye then. Once, at the Citadel, I came into an empty room and saw an empty chair. Yet I knew a woman had been there, only a moment before. The cushion was dented where she’d sat, the cloth was still warm... ...and her scent lingered in the air. If we leave our smells behind us when we leave a room... ...surely something of our souls mustremain when we leave this life? That’s… that’s exactly what I was reading. Do you believe now? Okay, what's the trick? Is it telepathy? And why would you believe in telepathy but not in astral projection? Oh me... Look at Ícaro, there are biblical mentions about astral projection. Studies from the Kabbalists and even Rosicrucians. Just because a few virgin scientists make fun of it ... ...you will not believe? What's the problem about them being virgins? Come on, didn’t you feel my presence in any moment? We didn’t spend that night together. I later came back to my hotel room to my creative thoughts and my enchanted thoughts for Adriana. On the following night, after a few kisses, she offered me a room. But not her room, and with educative intentions mainly. What shall I do now? Hmmm. Undress yourself, lay down and get covered with the sheet. Generally when women ask me to undress they have other intentions. For beginners, the lesser clothes the better. Cool surfboard. But, just to clear things, if I project myself in boxers I’ll be in boxers? No. Almost always, I get in trance naked and get projected dressed, relax. But wow, you need some working out. Okay, and now? Now you gotta simply visualize. You’re a film maker, you must be good doing it, right? I should be. Focus on your breathing and relax. Is it kind of meditation? Cos I’ve meditated before. Good, it might help you. Relax, breathe. You gotta get rid of all the tension in your body and now you have to imagine an elevator in front of you. An elevator? - You know what an elevator is, right? - I have a vague idea. Think of an elevator with all the details But you gotta use the power of your imagination until it gets palpable in front of you Then you gotta get in this elevator, press the button, so the elevator goes up, and up... Your voice is making me sleepy. You can’t do it. Or you’ll mistake the trance with your dream. Ok, I’m gonna try. Now you gotta think this elevator is taking you out of your physical body. And when you come back, you will be aware of this. That's all? That's all, but you gotta really visualize it. I got a radio downstairs, I’m gonna get it. A radio? Gonna put some music on? No, music would disturb you. I have some elevator sounds recorded. I’ll play them for you, it should help a lot. Elevator music is usually bossa nova. I’m not very fond of bossa nova As it didn’t work that time, I only dreamed about an elevator... ...on the next night she offered me another technique. ... I’m gonna turn off the lights and put some blizzard sounds on to guide your concentration and then I'll leave the room, and tomorrow you tell me how was it. Now you gotta close your eyes, relax. Focus on your breathing. Breathe in One, two, three, four, breathe out. That's it. Focus on your heartbeat. Try to imagine its color, its texture. Thump, thump, thump. Focus. Try to imagine the cells of your heart, each one of them. Get in trance imagining the cells of your heart. In a few seconds you will be able to detach yourself from your physical body. I haven’t projected myself out of my body that time, but had a unique dream. The so called lucid dream. All of a sudden I remembered of something Adriana told me... That we could totally control our lucid dreams... And instead of figuring myself flying or something like that I imagined her, showing up. - You know this is a dream, right? - Yes. When I told her about what happened, or “happened” She smiled and said: Is it some kind of flirting? No. Seriously, I really dreamed about it. If you’re flirting it’s fine with me. And so, what I desired and had had in my lucid dream was actually a premonition of our first time. So, when did you begin with this thing of extra-sensorial experiences? I started in my first year of college. I met a person who showed me, taught me and I liked it. In college we usually have some embarrassing experiences, sometimes, but I liked this one. In my college times I was a kind of a loner. I was the only one who wasn’t left winger and I also hated Glauber Rocha, so. But tell me, what were the most impressive plans and places you’ve even been? Or even lucid dreams? In lucid dreams we are the builders of our own world. In my case I am a kind of director, and also author and also protagonist. But in astral projections it’s another state. Cool. I think I’ve never been in this state, right? No, you haven’t even reached the vibrational state. Vibrational? I think not. What is it? When our body begins to tingle, we feel an intense vibration, like an earthquake. No, I’m pretty sure I haven’t experienced it. I think I would be afraid and probably wake up Oh Icaro, I think I was a bit irresponsible with you, you know. I liked you and put you into this. I should have taught you better, I should have explained more. So you liked me? - Yeah. - Be sure that the feeling is mutual. Oh, yes? How nice. Well, when you told me you were a filmmaker, I wanted to give you this gift, you know. So you’d understand there are countless possibilities. Improve your creativity, who knows. Wow. I promise that from now on I will be a better learner. How nice. When I’m not very well, I’m led to some kind of threshold It's the closest plan here to ours. And the most sinister one, you know. I see legions of spirits and departed relatives too. I even see some types of demons. But then, I do not know if they are real characters or just some kind of thought-form only. Okay, explain me better now. What are thought forms? Well, it was defined by theosophy The thought ... it creates an astral field. And when this is combined to strong emotions For example, passion, desire, fear, or terror... they are empowered to the point of creating a life of their own ... Well, when we pass, we leave a trace, thought forms. And all this astral matter creates an ocean of thoughts... ... that will surround us and keeps surround us. Well, now, I'll guide you, then I'll turn off the light, turn aside, and sleep. Just now? That. I want to see if this room works as a kind of temple to give you luck. But hey, don’t fall asleep. Otherwise you’ll have only some kind of lucid dream again. Come on, breathe ... Ícaro? Ícaro? Ícaro? What happened? A nightmare? I Think... I think it was that sleeping paralysis you told me about. You should have used it to leave your body. That's how it works. The mind awakens and the body asleep. Oh, there were voices, there were evil entities. That thought-form thing too, I guess. Calm down, relax. When it’s like this you gotta think about good things... ... have positive thoughts, about things you really like and love. You gotta try harder, then you’ll be able to project yourself. I’m sorry. I got scared and couldn’t make it. Are you calm now? If you need an encouragement... I’ll let you know that there is astral sex and it’s very good. And who would I have sex with? Some thought-form? Yeah, or with me. If you could find me. But if I had sex with a thought-form wouldn’t it be cheating? Yes, it would. You’re an imaginative guy, aren’t you? No. Very imaginative. You would be a good writer of funny and fantastic stories. Too bad that your destiny is in some sanatorium. Your creativity is associated to schizophrenia. You believe in the stories you make up. I really didn’t convince you of anything? Well, you’ve convinced me you’re not lying and you’re not a scammer or mythomaniac. So, go on with your story, but please, spare me from details. I do not want to know how many times you had sex in your dreams... ...or who was above who, ok? Just go straight to that part where your so called Adriana went missing. Wait up. Ready. Raquel? Oh really? Did anyone die? It’s our business then? I see... Fuck and us? I mean, how about us? Ahan. Ah ok, we’ll keep on babysitting here then? No, no, locking him up would be too extreme... ...leaving him amongst these burglars, these weekend kidnappers. I just wanna solve this case, damn it. OK ... - Your sister will not be able to come. - Why? She came nearby, near Mogi-Bertioga and on the last gas station... ...she was informed of a big traffic congestion... ...caused by a nasty accident between a bus and a van. She decided to return and try again tomorrow She asked us to treat you well and tomorrow she’ll be here to bring you back to reason... ...and solve this misunderstanding. - And now? - Now go on with your spiritual love story. Well, we stayed for some time in Campinas, at her house... And after that I went back home, in ABC, to my life of freelances and small jobs... ...as my career hasn’t properly begun, you know. We used to meet almost every weekend. The trips back and forth and also phone calls, whatsapp and all of it. With all those trips we eventually met each others familes. Did you know Icaro, that Adriana some time ago, got involved with silly things such as spiritism? And astral travels! No, she never told me bout it. She just stopped after a priest came home to talk to her. If she wants to play the atheist it’s fine... ...just leave the soul uncorrupted, right? And what did the pastor tell her? The truth. It's all Satan's things. The priest told me that the principle of astral projection is to separate the soul from the physical body. ...and it totally gets in conflict with the bible. Therefore, the bible says the soul is a part of our whole body, and they’re indivisible... ...capable of resurrection, if you believe in Christ. Not in reincarnation. Are you religious, Ícaro? I think I share Adriana's beliefs. No one really seems to take serious this thing of astral exploring, not only the religious people. - Can I come in? - You're already in. What if I was naked? I would have a nightmare, that's it. I want to ask you something about your girlfriend , Adriana. About both of you, to be straight. Hmm critics. Who doesn’t like them? No, come on. I liked her. I mean, I think she likes you, right? But you're all rational, you know. And she seems to be more, I do not know. Exoteric. And it is a problem because you'll be a psychologist, allright? There aren’t astral projections Icaro. Lucid dreams, yes... ...but the projections, they’re more like self - hypnosis, illusions... and that’s what most rational people think. And what are they for you? Hallucinations? Yes. And what's the problem? Oh, you wanna be a famous filmmaker... And I’m afraid you become some kind of Paulo Coelho from the screens. Paulo Coelho? How about? A Millionaire? I would be ashamed of you ... Still if I’m wrong and there really are astral projections, promise you’ll never spy on me. Little sis, I don’t even like you physically, I wouldn’t waste my time with you in spirit. Don’t fool yourself. You love me. So, my sister who claims that she’s never met any Adriana, used to mock me all the time about her. Are you leaving? You’ve read your today’s horoscope, right? Bye Dad. So, in a certain night, alone at home, in the most absolute peace... ...after many telepathic attempts, I could share a lucid dream with Adriana. You know this is a dream, right? Yes, you are not real. Lucid dream You're the Adriana inside of me, whose all the secrets I know. You know it’s not only a dream. You’ve made it, silly. We made it! It takes a lot of telepathy to share a dream and we made it! I think some oneiric sex would be great now. We better don’t. My parents are visiting and they could listen to us. Yeah, it would be weird. Yes I already speak while sleeping, guess how many other noises we would do. They would think you’re being manhandled by satan himself. - You should not have mentioned Satan. - Why? - Look! - Is that the devil? The devil I have in mind since childhood. And as it’s a shared dream… You know it isn’t real, right? We do not know anything. Come on. Are we running away through water? We gotta fall on our backs. That’s the only way to go from a lucid dream to a projection. - You never told me that. - Because I've never tried. It’s gonna be the first time and it can go wrong. But you gotta release my hand and let me go, this fall cannot be protected. Then I left. From a lucid dream to an astral projection. I went to a place I often visited in my dreams and memories. It was a soccer field I played when I was a kid. And there was somebody waiting for me somebody who has never been part of that place or my childhood. - Clarice, is that you? - And who else would it be? - Are you some kind of ghost? -You’ve aged a bit huh handsome? - You haven't. - And how could I? I was not there anymore and you were gone. I could not say goodbye. We never said goodbye, I never did. I thought you expected me to come back and maybe I would. Just like Renato Russo said in that song, The good ones die young. Good? Babe, I was never good. I was a bad girl and you know it. Look, sorry for breaking up with you before dying and sorry for having died... ...but things were meant to be like that, in that order. You had to loose me so you wouldn’t miss me that much with my departure. You shouldn’t have gotten in that car. You didn’t know anyone and the car tipped over. Yeah, but then, it would have happened in any other way, but it would have happened Our future isn’t defined by our choices, our future defines our choices. So you’re saying there’s no free will? Some like that. But look... ...you'd leave anyway, you were in town for a while, studying... ... you didn't belonging there, and I would never leave. What you are? Are you a spirit or a thought-form? Look. Unfortunately for you, I'm fucking nothing. You're just dreaming again. No! I left. I left my own body. I saw and I’m pretty sure of what I saw. Yes you did, but you didn’t even left the room. You've left, thought of me and then you came back. Now you’re floating, centimeters from your body and all around here is mist. How, how can you say these things as if you knew them? You know these things, Ícaro. You’ve read about it but didn’t gave the right attention, among many other things. ... ...But someday it would be important to remember. Where are you going? I'm leaving. You must wake up to remember these things Just wake up, okay. And good luck with your Adriana. I hope she makes you happier than I did. The piece of paper given to me by Clarice would only make sense about fifteen days later... ...when I met the girl who taught Adriana about astral traveling. So Giovana, tell Ícaro what you told me yesterday. Well, I wouldn’t have looked for Adriana to share it if it wasn’t important... ...especially because, my pupil here doesn’t need any astral counseling. I've been doing astral travel my whole life since I was thirteen. It's a family thing. My parents and siblings used to do it too. And I taught Adriana, as you might already know. I’ve studied books and reports about the subject I’ve always wanted to know what was it all about ... But I haven’t done it lately, because I’m engaged and my fiancee doesn’t like or believe in these things. But he went on a trip to the south of the country, to his homeland, to visit his sick father... ... then I took the chance to visit the astral worlds I was missing so much. I just wasn’t expecting that many answers around me. That place your ex told you, you know? The Na Koja Abad? She's been there. At least that's what I understood. But I thought that the whole astral world was this Nakoja, nakoja ... Well, this land of no-place. And I was reading last week, a guy named Henry Corbin, and... ...he talks about this land and also about the Persian Sufis. I don’t know if you’re familiar, but the Sufis were the esoteric people of Islam And I do not know, maybe they embraced islamism to avoid being slaughtered or something like that. I do not know who's Henry Corbin But the important thing is, there is a matter called Alan Al-Mithal, formed by though And in this world of no-place it would be like a holographic space And therefore, formed by the same stuff of dreams. Stuff of dreams, the film. Humphrey Bogart. The Maltese Falcon. He speaks about it at the end of the film, the stuff dreams are made of. No..? Ok, sorry. That's it, everything is thought-form. And God, God would be the collective consciousness of all things... The whole dreaming parts, and each part being the whole. We are all parts of an immortal dream of God, and we are all God. Complicated, isn’t it? But that’s what I was told. Told by who? Or what? Angels, masters, I wouldn’t know how to say Thought forms, archetypes, whatever. They had the knowledge of all things in them. They began by quoting the Plato’s cave myth. Yes, everything we see are shadows, illusions. Our backs are turned to the world while we observe shadows on the wall. Everything is Maya. - Maya, of illusion. - Yes. You choose the approach, the thought, science, mysticism, religion... On the horizon of random events, at the edge of the Cosmos, there our universe is projected. But what would exist beyond this event horizon? The real me, the real you, the real God, or Gods. There was a border separating this imaginary world from this horizon of events. The angel told me he’s never been there, and if I wanted to cross the border ... ...he wouldn’t know what would expect me there. Everything was so insane... ... but the slightest possibility of never seeing my fiancee, Tarcisio, once again... ...made me want to come back, and so I did. If I wanna go to this place, what do I have to feel? What must I intend? The great crap in it all was that the meeting was a dream A shared dream I had with Adriana. And she was lucid and I was not. It’s alright, she broke into my sleep, my regular dream ... ...to reveal an experience of astral projection she had that same night. . But Giovana, she only appeared in those lucid dreams or those astral projections... ...because she simply didn’t exist in our plan anymore, for a long time. And who taught all this voodoo of astral projection? That’s the point. Giovana died in the 80’s ... ...and Adriana only met her on the astral plane, where time does not even exist. And you want me to believe in all this madness? It is? Man, I didn’t believe it either. Icaro, let’s make a deal, we stop exploring astral worlds together. No, that’s not, not what I mean. What I'm trying to say is that I can't understand. There’s no logic for me. That’s too much. Icaro, next week I’ll try something new and I need your help. What Adriana wanted was to go where Giovana had been... ...and then cross the line Giovana couldn’t. I will be back, Icaro. Just relax. I’ve read about people who go to this forbidden place... ...and the worst that happens is not remembering about it. So, why going if you'll forget? Because I may not forget. And anyway, still if I forget, it will be recorded in my subconscious, and then... ...if I have a very different dream, I shall recognize the signs. Speaking of dreams, I had a bad one. I slept in the afternoon and had a very bad dream. I know the language of dreams is very symbolic, but ... Relax Icaro, everything’s gonna be fine. I’m prepared, you know Even to come back immediately if I'm scared. I really had a horrible dream about her. In my dream, she was maybe in a coma, unable to come back from an astral travel she made. Adriana... Adriana wakes up! In real life she didn’t succeed very much in her first attempt. Do you mean you’re giving up? No, I won’t give up, I’ll try again, with more humbleness this time. I’ll say a prayer before, or make a ritual, anything. But not here, in this room. Where then? Well, in São Sebastião. It’s a tranquil place... ...with positive vibes all around us. Let's go? Hey. What about we go to the beach? Let's go. ..Wait till a save this into pdf. Save what? It's a prayer. A Huna prayer, from the Hawaiian Kajunas. I think I've heard something about them, or read it. Listen to this. Actually, I’m not really in the mood for praying. No, we’re not praying. It's too long, I was just going to read the finale to us. Well, I just don’t wanna miss the sun, but if you read fast. Ok, fast. Now I send a message of faith to my higher self... Asking for guidance, protection and help to realize in a fast way ...a very important project I have in mind, and for which I am working with dedication and love Now’s the part where I say what I want and then I go on And will certainly be for the good of everyone involved. I also ask for my faith to be firm and that I may become a channel... ...a permanent connection with the creatures of light... ...developing every potential that might help this communication. What’s on your phone? That huna prayer I showed you, you know? And some information by me. I wanna use the method of induction and saturation. I hope it works. It’s gonna work! And your quest’s gonna come to an end! IT IS. When I get in trance you will probably be sleeping. Good night then. Good night. So, the place was like this? It’s just a sketch. You know it’s not my kind of drawing. Congratulations. I couldn’t reach the crowd, you know. Only look through distance, like I was being kept away. But why? Fear, concern? No, I was really been kept away. I walked, and walked but at every step ahead I was actually retreating two. Very strange, as if it were a place that could not be. Like a sacred place? A place too big, and forbidden for a beginner like me. Wow, if you’re a beginner, it makes me what? Research, I need to research. I gotta try forums and even the deep web if possible. But I need to find that answer. - Sprite? - The closest thing to juice I could get. Ok, put it somewhere, I gotta leave this forum before. Ok, I’ll hold it. I have good and bad news for you. Which one do you want first? The bad ones, of course. OK. For what I’ve been researching, ... ...to go where Giovana went, I must be clean, like, really purified, you know. So I’ve decided to make a three day fasting, without meat, sex or alcohol. To finally ttry to get where Giovana went. Wait, wait. No meat, sex and alcohol? Are you crazy? Wouldn’t it be easier to evoke Giovana and ask “Hey, how do i go where you’ve gone?? Giovana isn’t a spirit which I can evoke whenever I want Dude, I gotta pay attention to what I'm doing. After all, if I mention something she still hasn’t been through ... ...I can interfere in the future, and it cannot happen Don't you remember? Time does not exist, Ícaro. When I meet Giovana I gotta know if she’s been or not to the land of no-place. Wow, what a crazy excuse. But it's real, believe me. And the good news? The good news is that my fasting begins only tomorrow... So tonight we can have sex, drink and eat some burgers around here. Like a compensation? Yeah, a compensation. But you know you’re weak for meat, right? So, now the sun, my great enemy is away, I’m gonna swim at the sea. Wanna come? Before you leave I wanna ask you something…... Why this whole obsession? This obsession to reach that place and go beyond... To find this answer, this source? I mean, so many religions were created and based on men who had visions, revelations... ... that actually, if we rationally analyze, might have all been lucid dreams or projections. For example, an angel made the revelations to Muhammad, right? What if Muhammad was on the astral plane too? And I do not know, what happened is that he attracted what he wanted... ...like Jesus Christ, for example, or Allan Kardec? Ícaro, you're confusing me. OK. What if all religions are right and wrong? And actually, at the end of it all, we’re gonna find what we’re looking for. In this scenario, you’ll certainly find what you are looking for... ... this truth, this source, this god. But the question is: How will you know what is real, what was real and not just an illusion? Look, at least will be a very crazy travel. But I admit, you got me thinking. Well, I’m gonna swim a bit. If you decide to come along, put our stuff in the car. The fourth night after that conversation was yesterday. The night Adriana disappeared and the reason I am here now. Stay right here in the room. Do you want to to stay all night on the couch? Yeah, or choose another room in the house. There are many, even that one you’re already used a lot. I’m actually hopeful for your projection to finish soon so you can call me back to bed. "Hey, come back to bed with me". Wow, what a needy guy… But I want you to promise me one thing. Okay, I promise I won't have astral sex with anyone. Word. That’s not it, but interesting how your mind works. It's about time. What about time? Whatever you find out about past or future, related to us, together or not... ...you're going to tell me. Maybe beautiful or dark, you’re going to tell me. Even if an angel forbids you, even God Himself, you’re gonna tell me. And what if I don’t promise? You can’t deny tenderness or promises to beloved ones. Okay, okay, I promise. - Obedient, that’s the way I like it. - Silly. You’re going now then? I will, I don't wanna get sleepy ... ...and I don't wanna any lucid dreaming bothering me, and disturbing me. Have a nice trip then. Always my love. The number you’re calling does not exist. Verify the number and try again. The number you’re calling does not exist. Verify the number... The number you’re calling does not exist. Verify the number and try again. So, you already know the rest. Aand what happened to Adriana I can imagine, I can guess. And what would you guess? I would say that... I would say she has reached a stage... ...a place where she never existed or ceased to exist. And just like on the internet, all her history could have been erased. But you clearly remember her. Why? Do you think you’re special? Or a chosen one? Maybe we're soulmates. All evidences point to psychosis, maybe schizophrenia. Can’t you at least consider it? No, I was there. I know the truth. Just give me one, a tiny evidence so i can believe in you. But unfortunately it’s not possible, right? We haven’t “astral detectives”... ...here in São Sebastião. What do you think I am? A lunatic? I think you have some kind of psychosis, a psychologist might help. We have a woman here in town who works with us. Until then, you’ll stay here until your sister comes. I'm gonna call the psychologist. Who knows if Freud can explain something, right? Oh, and the house owners, the “Adriana’s parents”are coming tomorrow. They wanna look to your face and confirm they’ve never seen you before. I’ve sent them your facebook and by the facial picture, they didn’t recognize you. Everytime the phone rings, it's a nightmare. Ready. Yes. What? They also aren’t coming? Fuck. More trouble for me. The guard will have to babysit then. Ok, ok. The house owners decided to drop the charges of invasion. They felt bad for you and aren’t coming anymore... ...after the caretaker told there was nothing missing in the house. This might be good, right? But you won’t stay alone, oh no. I don’t want to get spread, all over the beach, the story of a madman who killed himself ... ...or kept shouting the name of a non existing person. Sorry. So, I gotta wait until my sister comes and take responsibility over me ... ...or wait for the psychologist to arrive and talk to me? Sorry, but you can’t stay alone. Not after all this madness. I’m gonna ask the psychologist to come sooner, earlier ok? Don’t worry. Maybe she takes you to some clinic, right? You look dangerous to no one but yourself, but we better be sure, right? I better make sure, do not? May I use the internet again? Very quickly. What are you up to, huh? Wanna publish that I’m keeping you here without evidence? Wanna play the victim? No, no way. I can sign a term, if there’s such a thing. I just want to... I need to check if there's anything else I didn’t notice about Adriana. Still this thing, boy? Ok, ten minutes for christian charity, but look, don’t fuck with me, huh? If you publish on the web, twitter or facebook posing as victim, I’ll fuck with you, dude. I won’t do it. Ok, but don’t delete the history. Don’t do what the universe did to your Adriana. - Adriana! - Ícaro. You...You are... You've disappeared! Yes. Just like this cell phone is not with you. The deputy took it from you. It’s in his desk drawer, remember? So... You’re dreaming. Get lucid Icaro! Wake up in this dream. Dear Icaro, you know how to find me if you really want to... ...if you accept to leave the life as you know You’re in a lucid dream... ...just fall on your back, like we already did, strongly desiring to find me. Your desire and your faith must be unshakeable when you wake up floating above your body. And if it’s like that, we’ll be soon together. We have a bond, something very strong and that’s why you’re the only one who didn’t forget about me. But I know you already knew it all. So just choose... Just decide. We are such stuff as dreams are made on; and our little life is rounded with a sleep (The Tempest) Tradução: Antonio Alves
