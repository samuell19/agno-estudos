(MUSIC PLAYING) NARRATOR: The events depicted here have their origin in the documented history of this nation and concern the tragedy that befell Colonel George Armstrong Custer, his officers and men. Tragedy, like human life itself, must have a beginning, a middle, and an end. This, then, is what transpired before, during, and after the action at the Little Bighorn in the year 1876. It is offered without apology. (GAVEL BANGS) Be seated. This court of inquiry has convened to determine the validity of those charges of incompetence and neglect of duty instituted against Major Marcus A. Reno, staff officer under command of Colonel Custer, during the action in the territory of Montana. Call the first witness. CLERK: Captain Frederick William Benton, will you please rise? Captain Benton, you were attached to the command of Colonel Custer. That is correct, sir. And I consider it fortunate that I am able to be present here today to set straight the record, and clear Major Reno of the charges so unjustly leveled against him. (GAVEL BANGING) Captain, the court will put the questions to you. You'll confine your answers solely to these questions. I am sorry, sir. I cannot comply. The wrong man is sitting there. It is not Major Reno's conduct which should be under investigation here today, sir. It is mine. (GAVEL BANGING) I am prepared to prove this to you, if the court will permit. How do you intend doing this, captain? By starting at the beginning, before it happened. Otherwise I would be doing both this court and Major Reno a disservice by adding more half-truths to further distort the record. Proceed, captain. Where do you think it began? It began with my first assignment out west. I was to report to Colonel Custer at the fort. En route, I was ordered to act as escort to the family of an Indian agent. My companion was a veteran scout. The only name I ever knew him by was Dakota. This was the land of the Sioux, the so-called treaty land whose harvest was murder and barbaric torture. Six, hard years of Indian reprisal against the white man's blessings. You'll get used to this. You haven't. No, I haven't. I'm not very sociable, but I broke a rule with the family that lived here. I got in the habit of dropping by off and on. Why the hell did they settle here? This is Sioux territory. Like trying to keep house on top of a keg of gunpowder. What did they expect to raise here? Kids. Three of 'em. Don't like kids, captain? You don't have to tell me what happened to them. How can the Indian respect our rights if we disregard theirs? Trespassing on their lands, herding them into filthy reservations, starving them to death while corrupt Indian agents steal the food out of their mouths. Mrs. Turner's husband's an Indian agent. Maybe you should ask her about that. A better idea to ask Turner himself about it. A better idea would be to herd every blood-hungry, stinking Indian into one big stockade and burn it to the ground. Hyah. Everything all right, Mrs. Turner? Fine, sir. I'm afraid you're going to get awful tired of my asking the same question over and over again. Well, we'll be in some time tomorrow, ma'am. I imagine that your husband would be just as anxious to see you as you are to see him. You're very understanding for a bachelor, captain. I'm frankly surprised. Well, your understanding of bachelors, ma'am, is rather limited. (SHOUTS) (MUSIC PLAYING) (ALL SHOUTING WAR CRIES) Full gallop! Hyah! (SHOUTS) Head for the fort! Keep moving! Keep moving! Head for the fort! We could use some shade. Troops, dismount. Take cover. (GUNSHOTS) (ALL SHOUTING WAR CRIES) (ALL SHOUTING) Why are they leaving? Maybe it's not us they're after. Come on. (SHOUTS) (SHOUTS) Troop, halt. Can we pick up the trail out of here? There's 15 different trails leading out of here. No matter which one we take it'll be the wrong one. I'd sleep better if we did, Dakota. (SHOUTS) Troop halt. Halt. (MUSIC PLAYING) The man's all shot up. He wants to surrender. That he does, captain. It... It's all right. Tell him that... that he's in safe hands. Tell him it's all right. (GUNSHOT FIRES) I don't have to ask why you did that. A cold-blooded murder needs no reason. Hell, it was an act of mercy. I just didn't want the poor critter to starve to death in one of those filthy reservations you were talking about. Troops, ho! SERGEANT: Troops, ho! Troops, halt! Left, hut! Dismount. BENTON: I regret, sir, that my first assignment under your command turned out so unfortunately. I think a more accurate term would be "disastrous," at least as far as the woman being taken captive is concerned. Yes, sir, Colonel Custer, I agree. I agree. I tried to follow their trail. When you become more familiar with Indian ways, you won't waste the time you did. I wouldn't have bothered. Well, I'm prepared to mount a search party and follow any leads there are, sir. There aren't any, so content yourself with following orders for the moment. You're to set out immediately on another assignment. Yes, sir. Your destination... The nearest bathtub. I don't want you tracking alkali dust in my parlor tonight. Whatever you say, colonel. Mrs. Custer and I are throwing a little party. You're invited. Why thank you, sir, I'll be there. Uh, about Mrs. Turner, Colonel? I have reason to believe Mrs. Turner and the children are alive. I could be wrong, but I flatter myself I know the Sioux and sympathize with them. You can't really blame them for trying to even the score against us, even if it means taking hostages. Yes, sir. Orderly? Yes, sir? Show Captain Benton to his quarters. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. (MUSIC PLAYING) Caroline. Don't tell me you're surprised. Well, no. No. I... I naturally expected to see you here. Would you excuse us a moment? Yes, ma'am. Your quarters are the fourth down, sir. Thanks, sergeant. Well, uh, it's nice seeing you again, Caroline. Bill? Didn't you get my letter? Oh, yes, ma'am, I got it. You made it very clear that I was not welcome here. Then you didn't get my last letter. Last letter? A woman's prerogative. I wrote you to say that I want to give us another chance. Does your father know you wrote the letter? No... Oh, Caroline, it's hopeless. You're still the daughter of a Confederate major general who's still fighting the Civil War. And who hates me for what I did. I couldn't live with that hate. Bill, I'm... I'm trying to work it out. How can he reconcile this lunacy with what he is now, an officer in the Union Army? He's a soldier. It's the only life he knows. And you'll never leave him, will you, Caroline? Bill, I'm trying to work it out. Don't you believe I can? I don't know, Caroline. I want to believe it, yet... Trust me, Bill. Trust me to work it out. (WALTZ SONG PLAYING) Miss Reno? No, thank you. Ready? Can you see the seam? I'm not a seamstress, I'm a man in love. May I take over now, captain? I've saved you this dance. With pleasure, ma'am. And all the others if you want them. Just you hang on. It does show. Look. You take my word for it. You look as lovely as any bride. Well, I should. Don't you recognize it? My wedding dress. (GASPS) I'd forgotten how durable your clothes are, and how patient you've been. You know what I'd do if I had a new dress? No. I'd give this one to another bride, and she'd be the happiest girl in the world because it's more than a dress. It's a wish. And it came true. And it brought me what every woman wants. They're waiting for us. I already told them you were ill. Whatever possessed you? (SLURS SPEECH) What? Just paying my respects. An officer and a gentleman always pays his respects. And where is the brave Captain Benton? Or is he afraid? He's a dedicated officer of the Confederate army. (MUSIC STOPS) Father, there is no Confederate army. You're making a fool of yourself. I'd heard you were indisposed. Good of you to come, major. Major general, if you please. Why? Why doesn't this rabble salute? I think most of you know Major General Reno. I'll salute that. A gallant former foe. Today he is one of us. We are, thank God, at long last, all of a feather. "All of a feather," you say. Well, that depends on just what color the feather is. And I see a white one sticking up over there. Its yellow roots buried deep in his shivering... That's enough, major! Don't try my patience. (CROWD GASPS) Your family tree just fell down. I think you'd better pick it up. Tom, come here. Take him to his quarters. I... I regret this very much. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, colonel. Give us some music. (WALTZ SONG PLAYING) (DOOR SHUTS) Thank you. I'm sorry, Bill. Of course you're sorry, Caroline. You're sorry for him and you always will be. I don't blame you for feeling the way you do. Thank you. You better see that he gets to bed. Bill, please. Don't chuck me out because of what he did. I know how you feel. Do you know I feel when I see you wasting your life coddling that foolish old man and his... obsessions? He's a sick man, Caroline. It's rubbing off on you. Then take me out of here, please. No, Caroline, no, no. Somewhere, someplace, the same thing would happen all over again. I wish I were big enough to say that it didn't bother me, but it does. How can I make him change? Change? He'll never change. But... What's to become of us? The night air has a chill in it, Caroline. You better get inside. Sir. Apparently you had more than one reason for requesting a transfer to the 7th. Yes, sir. It's the same reason, sir, I would like to request a transfer. I will not grant it, captain. I want you to prepare H company for immediate departure. But colonel, isn't there another officer you can assign? If I could, I'd start by assigning Major Reno to some post in Siberia, but I give you my word, the minute I can spare you, I'll arrange a transfer. Oh, Custer, I heard you were celebrating. And is this who I think it is? Captain Benton, Jessie Turner, Indian agent. Mr. Turner, I'm sorry... Benton, you're typical of this outfit. What were you doing, hiding under a rock when those savages made off with my wife and kids? Mr. Turner, we were overpowered... You're a liar! Isn't it enough that this unfit imbecile turned tail and ran to save his own hide? You and the rest of your jackass officers have to celebrate by roistering all night. Have you any idea what those savages might be doing to my family? Nothing, I hope. That's no answer, Custer. Why haven't you sent out a search party? With Indians, I try never to do the expected, especially when it might mean walking into a night ambush. Custer, you're shirking your duty and I'll bear witness to it. I'm glad you mentioned the word "duty." Now, as Indian agent, you've lined your pockets with government funds, moneys entrusted to you to buy supplies and food the Indians never got. Custer, those are serious charges, and I... I would advise you to retract them. I intend to prove it. I know how you got your job. You bought it from a corrupt administration. I'll prove that too. I'm going to see that these charges are heard in Washington. Every accusation I've made has been documented under my signature and sent to Washington. At dawn I shall implement a search for your family. And now, before you put your big feet in your mouth again, I suggest you use them for the purpose they were designed, and get off my porch. I'll see you before you leave. Yes, sir. (MUSIC PLAYING) Halt! Hold the troop here. Await my return. Are we ready? Yes, sir. Move out. I can smell them. That's fear you smell. Your own maybe. Colonel, when I pay for a haircut I like to get my money's worth. That's why I don't want to get scalped. (SCOFFS) I can think of several other good reasons. (SHOUTS) Scouts. Get ready. Fan out. Here goes your courage, major. (MUSIC PLAYING) Sitting Bull, Red Cloud, Brave Bear, and Crazy Horse. We are in distinguished company. I know of you, Sitting Bull. And you Red Cloud, Brave Bear, Crazy Horse. It is good we meet today in peace. CRAZY HORSE: Yes, but there have been days when we did not. The storm will come again. Not if we deal with one another fairly. The taking of the white woman as captive was done in the spirit of war, not peace. What of the stockade at the Black Canyon? Will you release our people if we release yours? It is beyond my power and authority to release yours. CRAZY HORSE: What did you expect of us then? In the interests of peace, I expected you to right a great wrong. Is that your answer? That is our answer. (MAN SPEAKING NATIVE DIALECT) (SHOUTING WAR CRIES) You will remain here. But one of your officers will go at once to the Black Canyon and free our people. Is this the choice you have made? You have left us no choice. My congratulations. A round of applause for his ingenuity. We came here to demand hostages, and now we're bargaining for our own lives. A masterstroke, Sitting Bull. (SLOW CLAP) (BUGLE PLAYING "DIXIE") Company I reporting, sir. And a welcome sight you are, captain. Well done. You're just in time for the execution. For the last time, will you release the captives? No, Custer. I will not. Then I shall hang you. Station the horses under that tree. Prepare four nooses. BENTON: Carry out that order. Custer, at my signal a thousand braves will answer. All of you will be slaughtered. Yes, but not in time to help you. And when they see you dangling from that tree over there, they'll sensibly pause. Long enough for me to hang you, and you, and then you. You will never get back to your regiment alive. True. But all four of you will precede me in death. Hang us and be done with it. Tashunca-Uitco. Custer, our lives cannot be bought this cheaply. You will release the captives? Red Cloud will bring them to you. Major Reno. It is your day, Custer, but there will be another day. Everything has its price. You and Captain Benton will take them to Black Canyon. I want you to see the stockade, and when you do, you'll want to hang our friend Turner. (HORSES APPROACHING) CUSTER: Your men, captain. Yes, sir. Turner, your wife's here. BENTON: Troop halt! Dismissed. BENTON: Turner had his wife and family back. And I had my first look at an Indian agency. Open it up here. I was in no way prepared for what met my eyes. Here was the shame of the West. What is this swill? Better than they deserve. Even a buzzard would run from it. Well, they're not feeding buzzards. They're feeding Indians. And one's a lot higher on the social scale than the other, captain. (MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC PLAYING) How come you never got married again, Dakota? You knew then, about my family? Yeah. It... It helps explain a lot of things. I never was much for... loneliness, but after that I... Well, I've learned to live with it. A man doesn't forget easily when his wife and kids were butchered. The Cheyenne, wasn't it? Cheyenne, Apache, Blackfoot, Sioux. They're vicious killers, all of 'em. They ain't even human. A man can't live on hate, Dakota. Well, he's doing a good job of it. Him I pity. Well, don't pity me. What you can't get through your head, captain, is a man can live on hate as well as love. You'll live to find it's a bitter substitute, Dakota. (MUSIC PLAYING) (BATTLE CRIES) Your order, sir. Have the bugler sound alarm. Cut 'em down. (BUGLE PLAYING) (WHINNYING) (GUNSHOTS FIRE) Cut 'em down! Cut 'em down! Get every last one of 'em, captain. (GUNSHOTS FIRE) (YELLING) I just gave you an order. I won't gun those people. I shan't repeat the order, captain. Every last one of 'em, Benton! (GUNSHOTS FIRE) (MUSIC PLAYING) Do you expect me to sign that? Yes, sir. I want him court-martialled. He deliberately disobeyed my orders. He refused to fire on the enemy. Major Reno, the enemy, as you choose to call them, were a handful of Indians unarmed except with the crudest weapons, prisoners if you like, tormented beyond endurance by Turner. Captain Benton was absolutely correct in refusing to massacre them. I only wish he could have stopped you. As it stands now, you've set in motion God knows what in way of bloody reprisals. If you dare press those charges, I'll see you trouble my existence no longer. (TELEGRAPH CLICKING) Well? It's your reply to your dispatch to General Terry, sir. (CLICKING) I've been ordered to report to Fort Kearny at once. The repercussions of that massacre are being felt already. And unless I'm mistaken, Major Reno, they're going to be on my bill. That's all, major. Is there anything I can do for you, sir? Yes. You can go with me. We'll leave at once. Yes, sir. Colonel Custer, you've got yourself in a very dangerous position. I knew that when you summoned me, sir. But I thought it was because of Black Canyon. You've got a damn sight more to answer for than that. You've been pulling tails in high places, The secretary of war and Orville Grant, the president's brother. The articles you wrote have been published. Your high-flown accusations hit home. According to you, most of the administration is implicated in selling positions to Indian agents. So you've been summoned to Washington as a key witness. I didn't say half enough, general. You said plenty. They're fighting mad and they're out for your blood. I've nothing to hide behind except the truth. You learn to keep a rein on your mouth. Be very careful what you say to the newspapers. Extremely careful. That's sudden and hostile country back there. The ambushes around the Capitol can match anything we get from the Sioux in ferocity. You're a good fighting man, colonel, but as a diplomat... Uh-uh. Well, that's a pretty good shine. (CHUCKLES) When do I leave, sir? Right now. Captain. General Terry. Uh, colonel? Watch your step. I'll do just that. Thank you, sir. This means I can't transfer you, captain. I need someone I can rely on back at the fort. Yes, sir. You're that man. But there's another man there, sir. Yes. You'll be under Major Reno's command, and you'll have to look out for ambushes. He'll try to assign you every miserable detail he can dream up. Forced marches. Dog watches. Latrine duty. I want your promise you'll stick it out. At least until I return. Well, that could be some time, colonel. Very likely. Will you do it? Yes, sir, I'll try. Good. I've got to get a letter off to my wife. She'll have to meet me in Washington. I'll take it back with me. Captain. Yes, sir? Try real hard. Yes, sir. BENTON: Custer was gone. Major Reno crammed 10 years of hating me, assigning me one dirty detail after another. I was seldom at the fort. When I was, the unhappy memories came floating back. But whatever my heartaches, they were nothing compared to Custer's in Washington. (MUSIC PLAYING) His charges against the administration stirred up a hornet's nest. Recklessly, he exposed corruption on every side, sparing nobody, including the president's own brother. He proved his point. And they hated him for it. Colonel Custer, you have maligned, censored and accused nearly every branch of government and every official connected with the administration of our western frontier. Are you quite sure, sir, you haven't left anything out? Nothing except my own personal opinion of you, senator. I have it on good authority your brother-in-law was just made Indian agent at Santa Fe, and that you're building a brand new house. Gentleman. I'm sorry. After today, my career doesn't look too rosy. And that affects you, my dear. You told the truth. What else could you do? Oh, a politician could give you a number of answers to that. Well, let's just say it isn't the way a soldier goes about getting his retirement pay. But anyway, you can always say I was a good cook, even if the goose I cooked was my own. Well... the president will understand. He... He's a soldier too. Why don't you see him? Try. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Well? The answer's the same. There really is no point in you coming here day after day. The president does not want to see you. Well, I don't propose to waste any more of my time. We're going back where we belong, where I'm needed, to my post. Unless I'm mistaken, you're under orders not to leave Washington. We're going anyway. You'd be violating your orders, colonel. The hell with my orders. And a quartermaster report, sir. Captain Benton reporting, General Terry. My apologies, sir, I reported as fast as I could, but I didn't have time to clean up. I didn't come here to inspect the crease in your trousers. Where you've been lately, I wouldn't be surprised if you were out barefoot in a barrel. First, I want you to know that Colonel Custer's been court-martialled. Court-martialled? What for? He left Washington without orders. He's been relieved of his command. That leaves the 7th Calvary without a commander. I'm offering the command to you, captain. General Terry, uh... Excuse me, sir, uh... Well... Captain Benton... After all... I mean to say, I am the ranking officer here. Major Reno, I've examined the fitness report of all senior officers. Well, I don't understand. I can't help feeling that... I'm sorry, major, but my decision was carefully arrived at. The rank of brevet colonel goes with the command. I'm not sure that I can accept it, sir. TERRY: You turned down a similar rank with the 9th Cavalry to be with Custer here. This time, I'd like you to take the promotion. I'm sure that Major Reno would be pleased to serve under you. Have I any other choice? Yes. You can resign. I... I'll carry out your orders, sir. In the meantime, I ask permission to go back to my quarters. Permission granted. Well, captain? I'd, uh... I'd like a little time to think it over, sir. Think it over? With the rank of brevet colonel? Yes, sir. I don't understand. Well, as long as I have your answer before I leave. That's all, captain. Yes, sir. Well, every dog has his day. And your friend Benton just had his. Terry appointed him post command over me. Well, doesn't seem to surprise you very much, does it? I didn't know you shared the general's low opinion of my capabilities. Can I fix you something to eat? "Eat." (SCOFFS) I'll tell you what I'll eat from now on. I'll eat crow. If I don't, Benton will damn well rub my nose in it. Can you imagine how it's going to be? (KNOCKING) I've come to tell you goodbye. I'm leaving. Leaving? I'm resigning my commission. I wanted to leave a long time ago, but I promised Custer that I'd stay on. But wh... why? You've just been appointed... An army that can court-martial a man like Colonel Custer is an army that I want no part of. It deserves to be commanded by men like your father. You're next in line. The general will undoubtedly appoint you commander of the post. It's all yours. With your permission, sir. Goodbye, Caroline. So... You won for a change. You should feel very happy and proud of yourself. What are you doing? The occasion calls for a drink. To the gallant officer who got his heart's desire after all, without even lifting a finger. To victory! Southern st... Oh, Caroline. I wonder what it's going to be like, victory. You might find it a little empty, with nothing to wrap your head around anymore, except me. Hey... Hey. Caroline, I... I never realized what it was for you. Neither did I until right now. We've shared a lot, right? Guess it's only been self-pity. Oh, I'm used to that. He deserved the appointment, and I didn't. Well, suppose we drink to that, and... No, no, no. He's twice the man I am. Anybody with a stubborn hide-bound fool would admit it. Oh, please, isn't it a little late for this? No. No, it isn't. I won't accept the appointment. No matter what he does, I won't accept it. He's got to stay, I mean it. You heard him, he won't. He will. If you tell him. Aren't you man enough to tell him yourself? Caroline, believe me, I'm not afraid to tell him. And I will. But what I have to tell him is only part of what he wants to hear. The rest... Only you can tell him the rest. You won't change your mind? No. You... You say this now, you feel this way right now, but you won't always. And then they'll be the ugly scenes again. No, you go to him. Go to him now. He's waited a long time. (MUSIC PLAYING) I don't want you to go, Bill. I brought you some tea. No, thanks, Libbie. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Whoever it is, don't let them in. I wouldn't leave anyone standing out in this rain. (KNOCKING CONTINUES) Mrs. Custer? Why, yes. Won't you come in? Thank you. I'm Roger Blaine. Senator Blaine? Yes. May I take your coat? Why, thank you. I have something of importance to discuss with your husband. Forgive me for not letting you know I was coming. It was intentional. My Washington experience has taught me the value of a surprise attack. As a military man, you should especially appreciate that. You have the advantage of me, senator. Oh, senator, won't you sit down? May I offer you some tea? No, thank you. What brings you to Ohio? You're a long way from home. So are you. But your present exile is of your own making. I think Grant was leniency itself in limiting it to this. You didn't come here just to tell me that. I must be blunt with you, Custer. Your words and actions were well-intentioned, but hysterical. It's by no means impossible, however, or hopeless. What isn't? Your career. As you know, the political tide is shifting. My party feels an exciting and popular candidate would win a November election. Are you interested? Yes, I... I'd like to hear more. Well, you're exciting, but, uh, not popular at the moment. I hardly need you to remind me of that. Uh, go on. You're running for office. Uh, it... It's kind of ridiculous. A discredited army officer... I can assure you there's a road back, Custer. And it could conceivably lead to the White House. I, uh, I'm afraid I'm anything but presidential timber. That's something for the voters to determine, not you. As a soldier you'll need victories. Now, there's no handy war around at the moment, so you'll have to stir up some dust with the Indians. But from this point forward, they become the enemy. A ruthless army of savages you must fight without mercy. But they're not. Don't go maudlin on me, Custer. It's either that or rot the rest of your life away in this dingy Midwest catch basin. The alternative is far more attractive, you must admit. Yes. Yes, it is. Far more. But just remember... Indians can't vote. Thanks. Hello, colonel. I just got off this article on your return to active duty. Good. Fine. Now all we need is a little excitement. But I don't mind telling you the kind of headlines Senator Blaine is counting on. I know the senator well. He expects me to report your exploits. But I'm only as good as the material you give me. I won't disappoint you, Mark. Well... Welcome home, colonel. Captain Benton, Mark Cambridge. New York Herald. On special assignment to my command. Oh, well, I hope you find it interesting out here, sir. We'll make it interesting. Won't we, colonel? Oh, about that promotion that General Terry offered me, sir. Serving under you is... Well, I... I'm just glad the promotion didn't come through. Well, this request for leave doesn't sound like you're too anxious to serve, captain. Well, that's so I can get married, sir. Apparently you've been mooning over this girl instead of paying attention to what's going on around here. Now, are you aware that gold has been discovered not ten miles from this post? Certainly. And that the prospectors and Indians are at each other's throats? We've got a crisis on our hands, captain. And I must say this is one hell of a time for you to be going off on some romantic joy ride. No man can be spared. Request denied. That's all. But, colonel... That's all, captain. Yes, sir. Well, I better get back to work. (MUSIC PLAYING) BENTON: The tide of fortune-seekers swept everything before it, swarming over Indian boundaries, wiping out promises, treaties, and Indians alike. (GUNSHOTS FIRE) The Indians fled, leaving their homes. But the gold-hungry men followed behind them. And then the Indians fought back. The Sioux nation began taking its toll of the invaders. With equal enthusiasm, they returned killing for killing. (BATTLE CRIES) Custer and his 7th Cavalry moved out to restore order. (MUSIC PLAYING) Detail halt! Troops dismount! Bring him along. Bring him on. RENO: What's his trouble? Uh, staking claims on Indian territory. He's the ringleader. Get your hands off me! I told him that that property was protected by treaty. Well, it most certainly is. I'm ordering you out of the area. Sergeant. Yes, sir? RENO: Get his gear and escort him and his friends off the reservation. Just a moment, major. Release that man. In the future, gentlemen, you'd be well-advised to keep your nose out of civilian affairs. Civilian? He's a thief, poaching on Indian property. My orders are to safeguard the lives and property of the white settlers. Yours are the same. But, colonel... I repeat, major, our job is to restore order no matter what the cost. Is that understood, major? Perfectly, sir. Carry on. Colonel, you know, I didn't know where you stood on this thing, but I sure as hell do now. You know, we been... We been, uh, trying to find some fitting name for this place and, uh, you just come up with it. Custerville. Well, I... I don't think I deserve such an honor. Oh, just leave that up to us, colonel. The honor's ours. Custerville. That sounds like a great dateline for the story I'm going to file on this. That was a smart move you made. Good hunting, colonel. BENTON: Gold was not the treasure Custer sought. But gold brought him something just as precious... His chance to focus attention on himself, and shine as brightly as any golden nugget in the public eye. But to make the hero image stick, he needed bigger deeds and bigger headlines. In pursuit of them, he drove his men relentlessly, himself hardest of all. His stamina was unbelievable and frightening. One day, Custer found what he wanted. A whole Sioux village, unarmed, unprepared. Halt! Halt! Halt! Company left! Front, ho! RENO: Company left! Ho! BENTON: Troop left. Ho! CUSTER: Twos left! Back up. Ho! Hyah! (BUGLE PLAYS "CHARGE") (MUSIC PLAYING) (GUNSHOTS FIRE) (BABY SOBBING) Dakota! (SCREAMING) BENTON: Dakota, with me. Hold your fire. Hold your fire. Dakota. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Please, don't... Hold your fire! Hold that fire! (SCREAMING CONTINUES) (GUNSHOT FIRES) BENTON: Get these men and women out of here! Move 'em out! Go on, follow him. Follow him. Go. Come on. Come on, follow him. Get the colonel. Get the colonel. (MUSIC PLAYING) (SCREAMING CONTINUES) BENTON: Cambridge did his job well. Custer got his reward. And the Indians buried their dead. (DRUMS BEATING SLOWLY, PEOPLE CHANTING) Great Spirit, their souls cry out for not one, but all the Sioux nations to avenge them. Send runners to the Cheyennes, the Crows, and all their allies. They must join us. (CHANTING CONTINUES) Dakota. (BATTLE CRIES) (SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE) BENTON: There were casualties on both sides as Custer drove on against the Indians. (BATTLE CRIES) But fear and strain were at work also, taking their toll of Custer's legions. By twos and threes and entire groups, the men began deserting. Traitors! Get 'em down! Get 'em down! (GUNSHOTS FIRE) (MUSIC PLAYING) Those deserters... who got away. What are their chances? That all depends. You know what I'm thinking, don't you? Well, if you're thinking I'm fed up, you're dead right. Indian blood has suddenly lost its flavor. And watching Custer shoot his own troops in the back hasn't helped any. Dakota. Don't try. Well, I'd like to think about it. I'm asking you to stop thinking about it. Spoken like an officer and a gentlemen. No, spoken like a friend. Give me your word, Dakota. Good night, captain. You could do with some sleep. With what's been happening, I'll sleep with my eyes open. That's a good way to get shot, coming up on a man like that. You oughta get your nerves under control. You think I'm pushing too hard, don't you? Yes, I do. There are limits beyond which men, no matter how loyal, won't go. Are you quoting the Manual of Arms, or is this your own opinion? There are so many bullets and so many men. You can't shoot 'em all. Sir. (HORSE WHINNYING) Guard! Deserter. Deserter! Fire at him! (GUNSHOTS FIRE) He's been hit, sir. He won't get far. Who was it? (GUNSHOT FIRES) It's the scout, Dakota. Well, don't stand there, major. Go after him. Yes, sir. Follow him! RENO: Troop L! TOM CUSTER: K Troop, follow me. BENTON: L Troop! (MUSIC PLAYING) RENO: Medic! CUSTER: Throw that deserter over the horse. Bring him in. He can't be moved. He's bleeding too much. Throw him over the saddle. He can't be moved! You get that deserter on a horse now. RENO: You heard what the doctor said. There's a firing squad waiting to deal with this weasel. And if any of you interfere again, you'll get the same. The man's dead, colonel. You're under arrest. Hi, honey. Hey, what's the look? I've never questioned anything you've done before, have I? I appreciate that, Libbie. And if they judge Captain Benton guilty, the penalty is death. Isn't it? Court-martial at Fort Kearny will decide. It's out of my hands. I can remember when you looked beyond the book of rules, when you did what your heart told you to. I can remember when the dictates of my heart nearly cost me my career. I can remember making a damn fool of myself in Washington. You were with me, when I went begging to President Grant. He refused even to see a fellow officer. The price of sentiment comes high. And there's also a price a man pays for striking a superior officer. And whatever that price is, Captain Benton will pay it. His fate is in the life of that court-martial. And yours with your God in heaven. (KNOCK ON DOOR) CAMBRIDGE: Colonel Custer? You have a visitor. (CRYING) Senator. I'm sorry I wasn't able to meet you at the railhead. I can understand that. It's been your busy season. The papers are full of your exploits. He can take a bow for that too. I'm no more than a mirror reflecting great deeds. Colonel, you're more than holding your own. Just keep giving us victories and the voters will do the rest. The biggest story of all is coming up, senator. I've just come from General Terry. Three of our armies are converging on the Sioux. But you'll only be one of them, colonel. The 7th will be just another regiment in a working team. Possibly not. For speed, nothing can outstrip the 7th. That's good. Very good. We need you in the vanguard. First in the line of battle, first in the morning papers. You know, a dessert cut in three pieces is never as rich or rewarding as the whole pie. I'm in complete accord. The whole pie, undivided. I can rest easy then. I wouldn't want anything to mar the advantages of such a triumph. Nothing will. The impending court-martial of Captain Benton might. If they execute him, there could be ugly implications. A charitable gesture on your part might be better advised. (APPROACHING HOOFBEATS) It's too late for that, senator. I'm sorry to hear that. (MUSIC PLAYING) Hyah! (GUNSHOT FIRES) Hyah! Hyah! (WOMAN SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE) (MUSIC PLAYING) (RHYTHMIC DRUMMING) (CHATTERING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE) Captain, you are alive because twice before you have spared Indian lives. It is a kind of faith in that willed by your own people. You've seen much here today. When your armies come, they will meet us in all our strength. For never before has the Indian brought all his power to bear upon a single enemy. I do not envy that enemy. Your people will die and we will die, staining this ground with our blood. But we will be here where they are no more. Deep down, you are one of them, even though they deny it now. And because you have seen the storm clouds gathering here, you would forewarn them if you could. My warriors will take you far away. Where? When the blood of your people have dried upon this earth, you will again be set free. (SPEAKS NATIVE LANGUAGE) Take cover. (GUNSHOTS FIRE) What happened to your guard escort? Same thing happened to this one. You're still under arrest. Bury these Indians. Bury 'em fast and bury 'em deep and take the ponies with us. Odd request. You must have a good reason. I do. Our very lives depend on it. Get off these horses. Get these Indians buried fast! Get 'em out of here! I gotta report this to Colonel Custer. He won't be at the fort. The 7th's all set to move out. Move out? Where? They're to rendezvous at the Rosebud. The Rosebud? Well, then, hurry, lieutenant. The lives of every man jack in the 7th are in danger. Keep those men on the ground! Bury 'em deep there! Come on, get a move on! (MUSIC PLAYING) CUSTER: Scouts out! MAN: Scouts out! Twos left! Forward, ho! Twos right! OFFICER: Twos right! RENO: Troop, ho! MAN: Twos left! BENTON: We rode on recklessly to meet up with Custer in the 7th. At the end of the day, we came in sight of the Rosebud. Without a doubt, sir, it is the most formidable array of Indian might in history. I think your capture and escape should have a place in history too, captain. I'll take everything you said under advisement. And with miracles occurring all around you, I think one more's in order. I'm restoring you to command of your troops. Well, thank you, sir. But... With the Indians multiplying at the rate you say they are, we've gotta start moving civilians. Your assignment will be to evacuate the miners and settlers. Good luck, and get going, captain. Yes. Major Reno? You will prepare your company for immediate departure. Assemble the rest of the regiment, and await my orders. You still here? I don't think he believed me. Sergeant. Well, he's right. It is a miracle that you're still alive, between the Injuns and the court-martial. Sergeant. Have the bugler sound assembly. At once, sir. Well, anyway, two of us are mighty thankful. Caroline and myself. Do you believe what I told Custer? Well, why shouldn't I? I don't think he did. If he ignores this warning, if he risks the 7th... Oh, for God's sake, Bill. Don't cross him again. Carry out your orders. Your generous gesture to Captain Benton will be welcome news to Senator Blaine. After today, he'll have better news. Maybe not, if the captain's report is correct. He probably exaggerated. But if he didn't? The bigger the enemy, Mark, the bigger the victory. (BUGLE SOUNDING) (HORSES WHINNYING) Troop's ready, sir. Have the troop dismount when assembled. Yes, sir. Troops! Dismount! This will be your final briefing, gentlemen. Captain Benton is already in our flank, covering Wolf Mountain. Major Reno will take three companies along the left bank of the tributary, across the Little Bighorn, and take up position. If you should engage the enemy, I will be on the right bank to smash them. You're dividing the regiment in three. You heard the report. We're outnumbered 20-to-1 as it is. Major, carry out your orders. But dividing the regiment? It's madness. At once, major. At once. (HOOFBEATS RECEDING) All right, move out. SOLDIER 1: Scouts out. SOLDIER 2: Scouts out. Scouts out. SOLDIER 3: Twos right. SOLDIER 1: Forward, ho! (BUGLE SOUNDING OFF) Twos left. (BUGLE SOUNDING) Ho! (BUGLE SOUNDS OFF) SOLDIER 3: Twos right. SOLDIER 1: Forward, ho! (BUGLE BLARING) BENTON: Time was running out. At any moment, I expected the hills to explode with fighting braves. (HOOVES BEATING) Ho, ho! Ho! Well, if it ain't my old friend. Pack your gear. You're moving out. Moving out? Whose order is that? Colonel Custer. The Sioux are out of hand. You'll be their first target. Pack your gear! Fall in behind! Move! MAN: Twos! (MUSIC PLAYING) All right, you miners, pack your stuff. We're getting out of here. Move along! (MUSIC PLAYING) They march in column of three. That is good. The branches will break more easily than the trunk. (MUSIC PLAYING) Now it begins. The first branch is yours. (SPEAKING IN NATIVE DIALECT) (BATTLE CRIES) (MUSIC PLAYING) (GUNSHOTS FIRE) (BATTLE CRIES) Ho! (GUNSHOTS FIRE) Go ahead! Move out! (BUGLE PLAYING "CHARGE") (GUNSHOTS FIRE) (WAR CRIES) Troop, halt! Over here, at a gallop! At a gallop! Hyah! (GUNSHOTS FIRE) (MUSIC PLAYING) (HORSE WHINNYING) (DISTANT BATTLE CRIES) (MUSIC PLAYING) Break the second branch. (ALL WAR-WHOOPING) (GUNSHOTS AND WHOOPING) Forward at a gallop. Ho! (MUSIC PLAYING) Troops, dismount and take cover. (DISTANT WAR WHOOPS) (GUNSHOTS FIRE) (HORSE WHINNYING) (GUNSHOT FIRES) Keyo. KEYO: Yes, sir? Find Benton. Get him down here. Yes, sir. (MUSIC PLAYING) (DISTANT WAR WHOOPS) (SPEAKING IN NATIVE DIALECT) (GUNSHOT FIRES) (WAR WHOOPS) (MUSIC PLAYING) (GUNSHOT FIRES) (GUNSHOT FIRES) Dismount! Form a circle! (MUSIC PLAYING) (GUNSHOTS FIRE) Captain, captain! Major Reno, he's being attacked down the river. He needs your help. BENTON: General Terry's on his way here! Find him! Get him here fast! Clear out! Sergeant, follow me! SOLDIER: I Company break through. Break through! (BUGLES SOUNDING "CHARGE") Break through! Break through! Break through! (ALL WAR-WHOOPING) (GUNSHOTS) Cambridge, get my horse and get out. You'll see my wife. Tell her... I'll find the right words, colonel. (MUSIC PLAYING) BENTON: Company! Company, take cover! (BUGLE PLAYING "CHARGE") Company, take cover! Hold your fire! BENTON: Hold your fire, and let him through. Hold your fire! Where's Captain Keyo? I sent him on to General Terry. Good. It could be the end for Custer. We've gotta reinforce. At the cost of more lives? No, sir. It's a mess of his own making. Let him get his own chestnuts out of the fire. (MUSIC PLAYING) I can give you covering fire if you break out now. Take 20 men. No. That's an order! Somebody might think I was deserting. And I know what you do to deserters. Don't you, brother? You shoot them, don't you? Like that. We're wasting time. I'm not budging. You go on ahead if you want to, major, but I warn you, you won't be covering yourself with more glory, just blood. (MUSIC PLAYING) (GUNSHOTS FIRE) Tom! Custer's out there somewhere, praying for sight of us. I'm going to him with or without you. All right, damn you! Mount up, men. We're pulling out. Give us cover! We're moving out of this trap... into a bigger one. Billy? You're ranking officer here, you give the order to die. Charge! Charge! (BUGLE SOUNDING OFF) Halt! (ALL WHOOPING) BENTON: General Terry was in time to save the rest of us. But time had run out for Colonel Custer. (GUNSHOTS FIRING) BENTON: The victory was theirs, along with the memory and the shame which the Indians and the Long Knives must share for all time. Of 251 officers and enlisted men under his command, none survived. In the words of Sitting Bull, the Indians had indeed had their day. Whatever his mistakes, George Armstrong Custer died a brave man. I have nothing more to add. And you, Major Reno? Nothing, sir. This court of inquiry is recessed for deliberation. (INAUDIBLE) (TICKING) (BANGS GAVEL) BAILIFF: Be seated. Major Reno, please rise. It is the conclusion of this court of inquiry that no further proceedings in this case are warranted. It is our opinion the conduct of those surviving officers of the 7th Cavalry during the Battle of Little Bighorn requires no review. By their gallantry, they have proven that the Army of the United States, in victory or defeat, is again worthy of the flag which it carries and the nation it defends. This court of inquiry is recessed. (MUSIC PLAYING)
