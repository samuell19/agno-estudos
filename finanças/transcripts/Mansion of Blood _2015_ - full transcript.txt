Mirabelle! Mirabelle, is it you? I know you're out there. I can hear you. I've tried to make you happy. It's not the end of the world. The only reason I bought this house was for you. I didn't do it for me. For you, it was just all for you. No! No! No! No, stop! Stop! No! No! No! You know it. I'm in. It wouldn't be the Terrible Trio if you didn't come along tonight, Sally. I do have better things to do tonight than go to a party at the Mayhew mansion. Ugh, that place gives me the creeps. But if it means so much to you, Samantha, I'll be there. Man, why are you always so bummed out, Drake? I am happy. Oh, god, Drake, can you smile? That's sad. In a tortured, dark way. That's why I get all the girls. You just treat 'em all like dirt, and they fall for you every time. You coming tonight? Shit, man, I almost forgot. You know my grandfather worked for Morgan Mayhew? No way. You know he had seances and crazy sex rituals? You could go into the Mayhew mansion estate party tonight with the lunar eclipse viewing party. I never go by this creepy place. You talk like that place is cursed. It's OK to drive by in the daylight, but I would never drive by there at night. Well, they've had construction crews up there for a year. Yeah, and hardly any deaths. See? No big deal. Did your grandfather get anything in the will? They never found the will. The state took the whole inheritance. Why would anybody put all that money into that old haunt? Scared of the dark? I know what you're scared of. Sally. No. Little people. They creep me out. Dude, that's the stupidest thing to be afraid of. Hey, I can't help it, all right? I just don't wanna end up alone. That's not even a real fear. That's like, "Oh, I need the friends" "'cause I need the attention." - You're so needy. - Yeah, you're needy. Thanks. See you tonight. The three of us? It'll be the Mayhem mansion. We are going to slay all the men tonight. OK, enough. I can't believe I'm gonna have to put up with this all night. You are all crazy. Sir? Yes, Mr. Murphy. You remember my beautiful wife Trixie, our caterer? Together we are the unbeatable team. Caterer and event planner to die for. I don't want something to go wrong because I got soft and allow you to hire your wife to cater the party. My gorgeous wife. I want my guests to have an evening they'll never forget in River Ridge. Absolutely. We are serving the finest French champagne. Imported? From France. Excellent. To serving appetizers from around the world. Squid. On wheat crisps. - And... - Escargot, with habanero pepper, and oysters on the half shell. No, no, no naked dames. My wife's here tonight. No Venus on the half shell, Tracy. Count on it. My Carlotta. I want my guests to have as good a time as you two lovebirds have together. Although I can't actually promise that anyone will fall in love. Is that a hot tub over there? Oh, you are so. Don't worry, just keep your eye off the wait staff. You know I only have eyes for you, pumpkin. I want this evening to be perfect. And the main course will be served at 9:40. As long as the main course is not my pocketbook. No, sir, we are on budget. Salmon from the Russian river. With hollandaise sauce. You imported the salmon from Russia? Yeah. Only the best. Where's the prime rib from? Wisconsin, sir. What country is that? It's right next to Bulgaria. Don't worry, sir, everything Trixie makes is spectacular. See you later, honeysuckle. ♪ It's a shame ♪ I don't know, we haven't reached the front door yet and I'm already creeped out. Oh, heck, there's no cell coverage out here. It doesn't look that scary. I don't know why everyone's afraid of this place. Everyone knows, Sam. Morgan Mayhew made his millions in life insurance, but he defrauded his customers and never paid the insurance policies. Yeah, so he had to come to River Ridge to get away from the world. Or escape his customers. And he was an occultist. Was he? His daughter and son mysteriously died. Morgan and his beloved wife Mirabelle vanished on the eve of the completion of the estate. Cursed. They were never seen again. Well, I mean he probably cut his wrist, wandered off to the ridge, and fell into the river. You are no fun. The night's young. Though what happened to Mirabelle? It's still creepy. It's perfectly fine. Gunner! You're welcome to join the party. I don't like parties. I want to make sure I have a complete list of the last-minute fixes. Most contractors, they come in, they do the job, and they just vanish. I hope you don't think I'm like that. I think you're doing a wonderful job. I hated this dump. It's OK now, but why do we have to live in River Ridge? I want to show everyone in this town that I made something of myself. Besides, it's a great place to keep Elijah out of trouble in his teen years. I worry about the trouble that boy can get into in New York City. You actually think about Elijah? You ignore him half the time. So you keep saying. I'm not in a coma, you know. I can hear. Sure. But you don't listen. Make sure that all the receipts get to my secretary tomorrow morning. Do me a favor. Can you put on a shirt and some slacks for tonight? I got all the local jet set coming in for the party. Jet set? The mayor, the county board of supervisors. I have a change of clothing in my truck. Good, 'cause I don't think one of my shirts would fit you. Welcome to Mayhem man, I'm sorry, Mayhew mansion. Funny. I apologize. It's Mayhew mansion. The construction workers use that term a lot, and I can't get it out of my head, and I know what you're going to like tonight. We have a lovely game called Name That Smell, and you will feel it before you see it. My, you're so lovely. Yes, we are. It's beyond explanation, your beauty. Oh, I'm so happy to have you here. Now you're a bit early because we're still setting up tables. Is the bar open? I love your attitude. It's very persnickety, and it has a feeling of tickling, you see. The bartender doesn't show up 'til dusk, but until that time, I can refresh you ladies with a drink. Now you're talking. My name is Zechariah. It'll be a wonderful night. Samantha, I don't know why you lug that giant bag around with you. Please. Enter the party dome. Very good. Excuse me. Are you one of the guests? No, I'm Aaron, I'm late. I was just dead today, but now I feel fine. Aaron. I think Zechariah's looking for you. I'm so sorry I'm late, sir. I just couldn't seem to get out of bed 'til dusk. You keep this lifestyle going, you're going to need a day pass. I'm sorry, sir. I don't know what happened today. Well, you better figure out what happened, because I can have you removed like a curse. There's Mark. Oh my god, guys, there's Drake. Drake is hands off until Sally has a real conversation. After all this time, why bother? After all this time, aren't you going to go kiss Tony? Sally! You've been chasing after Drake for three years. Go ahead, ride 'em, cowgirl. Yeehaw. If I went out with her, I'd have to scrape her off with a spatula. Never get rid of her. I'd have to kill her or something. Oh, that's romantic. Yeah, I am. Kinda chokes me up, I'm so sensitive. You could pass her off to me if Sarah won't hook up later. Oh, god, don't give me that macho crap, man. Hey, we all know you're sick with puppy love over Sarah. Well, if you ask her, she might say yeah. Girls usually do. Ask her what? Anything, Tony, anything. Where have you been? Places. I don't know. Don't take that tone with me. Stay out of trouble and do not go near the pool. Wow, thanks, Dad. Great party. I said don't take that tone. Hi, Tony. Oh, hey, Samantha. Hey, Mark. You wanna dance? Please, god. Did you hear from... I got into Stanford. Are you heading to Berkeley? We're practically going to be neighbors. We should get together sometime. Or, I mean, I mean, keep in touch. Tony, we're friends. At the least we're friends. Not bad. You owe me a dance tonight. I'm actually singing with one of the bands. I thought you gave that up. So did I. Thanks. Excuse me a minute. No. I'm a married woman. I'm a happily married woman. No one's happily married. If you think your husband's happy, it's 'cause he's sleeping around. So, how about you and I have a little bit of fun? Just leave me alone, or you'll be walking funny the rest of the week. Hey, you two. Soda is at the bar. Listen, tonight is a very important night for your father. I need you two to get along. Hello. Hi. Gunner Thorsen. Sarah Donner. So you're here for the party? I'm the contractor. Oh, I just love men who work with your hands and tools and wood. I enjoy working with my hands in carpentry. Really? I have a shelf at home that's loose and kinda wiggles. Oh, you should have that looked at. Oh, I... No, it could be dangerous in an earthquake. Well, I can't afford a contractor, and I'm just useless with tools. Well, I'm sure you're exaggerating. No, I'm hopeless. I'd be happy to stop by and fasten that shelf up tight for you sometime. Oh, I couldn't ask you. I volunteered. Oh, I... I insist. It's a public safety issue. Well, if it's a safety concern. Could you show me the estate? I've never been inside before. You know it's supposed to be haunted? I don't believe in ghosts. This is my lovely wife Rosalind, and that's our son Elijah. When I was a kid, I used to love exploring these grounds and buildings around here. I'm finally home. I had some extra money to rebuild this old dump so I figured, hey, why not throw a party? , I am married, eh? Arthur Mayhew. I can't believe you crashed the party. Shh, Kelly! The whole town was invited, practically. I'm on the guest list as Arthur Smith. You still aren't... The will's gotta be here if it's anywhere. Jesus. Maybe it got buried with old Morgan Mayhew, wherever he is. What is it you expect this magic will to say? Well, maybe it says the estate passes to the next of kin. That's what the family rumor is. That's the kind of thing families like to believe. All this could have been mine if we could have only found the will. I could have gone to an Ivy League college if I only would have had the money. If I had that money, I'd be on the first jet to Miami, and then off to Rio. No, or the south of France, depending on the time of year, of course. Of course. What I could do with that money! I hope you find out, Arthur. Me too. Oh, god, there's Mason Murphy. Well, don't strangle him. He didn't lose the will. I know, I know, I know. I've got it. Meet me upstairs at 9 p.m. Well, well, well, well. What do we have here? What's your name? Shirley. - What you're drinking? - Champagne. So cliche. Let me introduce you to apple martini. Shall we? All public areas have been completely redone, except for a few of the original pieces from the Mayhew estate. - What pieces? - What rooms? This diary was discovered during the renovation. Antiquities, that Mayan calendar stone, and the marble. Oh! It's almost time for the eclipse. What am I doing? Out, out, onto the lawn, everybody. Perfect. Oh, cool! Look at that! Man, that's screwy. It's not right. We're so small. We're so small. What is your problem? It's just, oh god. Oh god! It's not real. It's not really real! Hey, what are you looking for? I'm not looking for anything. I saw you looking for something. I was looking for something 'cause I saw you looking for something. Did you find it? I don't know. What are you looking for? Nothing. Me neither. I need another drink. The bar's out there if you're looking. Franklin Kopinsky, I summon you. Frank? Appear to me in this nether hour, bound by love and truth. Frank? Aren't you glad to see me, Frank? Samantha. I've missed you so much. Um. Yeah. Don't you miss me? Well, sure, I suppose, but I've moved on. Who is that? Just a friend. A friend? My spirit guide. Like I'd believe you. "Oh, I'll be right back," "just heading to the corner to pick up a case of beer." I was. They found you down by the river with a dead hooker. I don't know who she was. You drowned in an inch of water. Who does that? Who drowns in an inch of water? Someone who's so tired of your bitching they drink a case of beer down by the river. Screw you, Frank. Oh, now, now. Finally I'm dead and now you wanna do it. It's a little late for screwing, Samantha. I just have to ask you something. Finally she gets to the point. I don't have forever, you know. A winning lottery ticket was sold at the liquor store the night you died, and it's never been redeemed. Did you buy a lottery ticket when you bought that case of beer? You dragged my ass all the way back from perdition for money? And, no, I didn't buy a lottery ticket that night because I spent all my money on liquor and hookers. How could you say that to me now, Frank? I'm under a spell. I cannot tell a lie. Then did you ever love me? Of course I loved you. I was afraid I'd never see you again. What's it like? Beyond the veil? I'm sorry, Samantha, you're gonna have to find that out for yourself. Wait! Who are you with? Are you seeing someone? Are you dating somebody you met in purgatory? I'll see you soon, Samantha. Mayor August Harold. But you knew that, right? There, there, darling, it'll be all right. Get out while you still can. What? Run before it's too late. Well, it's a little early to announce my reelection campaign, but with supporters like you, I guess I can't lose. Run! Evening, Mason. Evening, Mayor. Great party. Eh, I've had better. What? Oh. Did you have any more trouble with that building permit? What building permit? Exactly. I hate to drink and run, but I've gotta run. See you Sunday, the. See you there. Where's Gloria? After you, my dear. An original oil painting of Morgan Mayhew, who built this mansion in 1920. You look just like him. You could be his son. Or his reincarnated spirit. You know, these old River Ridge families. We're all related. I'd hoped coming here would bring us closer again. We talk all the time. That's more than most couples I know. I remember when you were in love with me. I love you, Rosalind. I always have, I always will. , I've got tours to give. Is it clockwise? The lost bearer bonds. Mayhew Insurance. My grandfather was right! So easy, right there in front of everyone for all these years! How many times have the stocks split? These bonds are worth millions. Hi, Drake. What are you doing? What are those? I was looking for you, Sally. Wait, what? I've been crushing on you for years. What? It's true. Meet me at the upstairs landing in 45 minutes? OK. I got to put up with my half-wit twin brother! God, you disgust me! OK. I am tired of carrying you through life. It's time you carry me for a bit. Everyone has their cross to bear, and you're mine. I'm sorry. I am not gonna let you drag me down. Do you hear me? Just keep the house and grounds clear of trash, and try not to look like a slack-jawed idiot. I'm sorry. Why they didn't drown you at birth I will never know. God, what a freak! What was that? What was that? You guys hear that? No, it's just, you're being paranoid. Everything smells wonderful. Come on, guys, give me a hand. What did you do? Oh, good Lord, what was that? No worries, just a burn in the kitchen. Everything is all right. Nobody saw that, OK? It was an accident! What are we gonna do? Carpet and close it. Go get one! Hurry! All right, I got it, I got it. The original furniture. Clockwise? Counter-clockwise. My great-uncle's will. So easy! My father was right. Morgan Mayhew, he must have hid it in his drawer for safekeeping. I'm the sole heir to the estate. Oh! Mr. Murphy, I didn't know... Hello, Arthur! You know, I checked the guest list. There is no Arthur Smith on it. But I think your name is actually Mayhew. So what if it is? Can't I go incognito to a party? Spill it. OK. My great-uncle built the house. I just wanted to have a look. Hmm. Well, you're welcome to look around. Have a drink. Hell, stay for dinner. Just keep your sticky fingers off the furnishings. I promise. Well, have a good time, then. It's a party, for God's sakes. Oh, guys, please don't unroll that in here.

Hey, man, good job, hey! What you looking at? I think I just saw my dead sister. What? That can't be a good sign, can it? I think it's a sign you need to drink more. Great party, huh? Yeah. I still have to finish the inspection. Oh, well, sure. I understand. You know, I'm not the sort who usually... Neither am I. Can I get your number or? Sure. I hate hook-ups. You never see the guy again. I wanna see you again. At least one more time. 12, midnight, in the foyer. Could you give me a lift home? I'm sure I could give you a ride. Make it 11. Creepy place. I think I left my drink over there. Just stand up and see if you can reach. Thanks. But I wanted to stay and see the party. This party's dead. I want another drink. There's whiskey in the car. No, I want a fruity little drink with an umbrella and a twisty straw. Not tonight. Isn't that supposed to be my line? Seriously, Gloria, what's the problem? My business is done. I wanna get out of here before this party goes to hell. Aw, but that's when all the fun starts. Just what I need. A photo of myself in a drunken party with my mistress again on the Internet. Hey, I never said I was your mistress. Half the people at the hot tub were naked. Really? Let's go. Hey, hold your horses. What is that? Is one of the horses out of the stable? What's the horses doing over there? What's her name? Which one? My son must never know that his father's a philanderer, that he cheated on me with another woman. Other women? My god. Damn him, he will pay. By the way, I do have another copy of these photos, and I can show them to your son, Elijah, if you don't pay me, let's say, $10,000. You bastard. I'm going to take only 20,000. Just because I like you that much. Of course, Mr. Steel. Don't worry, Detective. I've got yours right here. Thirsty work. Time for Mother's little helper. We're not even sure if he came here alone. We put the body aside until the authorities can arrive. No, no! No. No one's calling the cops on my party. Oh, Tony. I missed your song. Did you see a woman in a red silk dress up here? No. Look, it's one guy who died. Tough luck. Nothing can be done for him now. Who is she? She's, nothing. After the party, we'll call the ambulance and the coroner, got it? But, sir... I said, you got it? Yes, sir. I still owe you a dance. Oh, yeah, of course. Hey, Tony, I don't wanna give you the wrong idea. No, of course not. Smile. Can you tell me what that big stone fragment is down in the room by the library? That's a very interesting story. I love interesting stories. He brought that stone fragment from an excavation site in Mexico City, an ancient temple. That very stone fragment is a piece of the Mayan stone calendar, and it's 3600 years old this very year. Shit. Human blood spilled on that very rock. Did they find anything underneath it? They didn't find anything. Imagine our luck, being here the very time the calendar starts a new era. Look, I tried a spell earlier and something went wrong. You promised not to do that magic nonsense. I lied! There are other forces here I wasn't aware of. What does that mean? It means anything could happen! Your worst nightmares, your biggest fears, your most personal demons. It's not funny. What the hell? Oh. Someone in this house is a murderer. Elijah, don't be too upset. We didn't even know him. He's a detective. What is he doing here? Half the county's here tonight, Mason. Someone must have wanted to silence him. But why? OK, we're gonna have to call the cops. No! No, no, no, no. We don't want to panic everyone, not until the party's over. Someone out there is a murderer! Mr. Murphy, oh, my. This has never happened before, two murders at one of my parties. I've never had two murders at any of my parties. And we don't know who it is. Well, what are the odds he'll kill again tonight? There's a maniac loose in here. This man has been shot, stabbed, and had his head kicked in. This is a party. Someone out there is a murderer! Don't be a coward. This party's gonna be good. That's it. I'm done in here. I'm not gonna get murdered. I've never seen the moon like that before. It's blood red. It's so huge. It's so stark. It's like an evil eye staring down on us. Isn't the eclipse supposed to be over at 9:40? The earth and the moon are frozen in space. And time. I think global warming. Smog. It's the ozone. It makes everything red. No, it's the hole in the ozone that makes everything red. - Really? - Yeah. You wanna correct me right here? You wanna make something of it, man? Let's do it. Oh, man. Are you OK? Violence makes me nauseous. What a goofball. What's going on? I am not being murdered by one of those sick, psychotic, demented bastards. Hey! They're party guests. What are you talking about? There is a murderer in this house. What? I am not gonna be next, OK? Hey, and what's your brilliant plan, Elijah? Screw you, Dad, OK? I am walking in this room. There are no windows, and there are no other doors, so I'm gonna lock myself in here until morning. I'll see who's still alive when the police arrive or when the morning comes. You know that if you go running off by yourself, you're gonna get murdered. No one is splitting up. I'm gonna walk in here now. At least let me stay with you. No one is gonna change my mind. I'll see you in the morning. I know he's safe in there. After all, he's all alone. Elijah! Elijah! My baby! We can't open this door. Drama queen. Mr. Corbett? Do you think it's still all right if I take off early tonight? Yes, Jody, I know your mother's not feeling well. We have plenty of extra hands tonight. I can't wait until your wife is busy in the kitchen. Jody, you know what I'm gonna do to you when I get you in that broom closet. You are so hot. You know I want it. Better get back to work before anybody notices. I'm waiting for it, stud. Samuel! How could you? With that trailer trash! How could you humiliate me like this? And now the whole town probably knows. I'm so humiliated! Oh! Bastard! How could he do this to me? I dedicated my entire life to him. I can't believe this! Oh, I'll make you a drink you'll never forget, Samuel. It'll be spectacular. Here's a little drink for you, sweetheart. Oh, you are so thoughtful, my sequined angel. I will always be yours. It has a little kick in it. Oh, you're my only kick. This is a little bit of a firecracker, to get you hot for later. She doesn't even know about the murders yet. That was so impolite, young lady. And that was your husband? What? Don't forget your drink, my darling. Oh, my god! Trixie! No, wait! Why? That's why, that's why! Poison? Poison, you moon-faced bitch? I never even knew you. I never even knew you at all. What's going on here? God, she's dead drunk. Just dead. Poisoned by Trixie. Hot damn, this is fantastic! What? Rosalind's ensured for five million dollars. I just turned a profit in this old dump. It wasn't suicide, was it? No. Great. You know, I could make it worth your while if you testified to that fact. We have to tell this to the authorities. In River Ridge, they're all either drunk or stoned 'til tomorrow morning. We talked about this. No cops. But you have a responsibility! To host a party. Todd, can you remove the bodies? Thanks, brother. Everybody, have a drink. Open a fresh champagne bottle, whiskey, vodka, whatever the hell's back there. We'll talk later about you-know-what. What happened to her? She's dead. Just like your son is dead. Didn't you at least love your son? Of course I loved my son, but a man can always get another son. But you have a chance to cash in on your wife's insurance policy once, maybe twice. Rosalind thought it was a bad idea to come back to River Ridge. Ha! Who figured? There's bite marks on Trixie's neck, but I think the fork killed her. You really think so? You're a genius. What are you looking at? What are you looking for? Finders keepers. Losers weepers. Oh, Trix. How am I gonna tell the boys? You having your own private party out in the cold or something? This isn't funny, freaks. Think it's funny trying to scare a girl with your stupid zombie walk? Screw you, I hope you never get laid. Great night! Did someone just keel over in there? Oh, yeah, I guess they did. It's terrible. But I found the will. You get everything here, and all the houses for about a mile around too. The original grounds were almost a mile. Now they can all pay me rent. That's not right. We're a poor county. These people have lived on this land for almost 90 years. My family's been poor for almost 90 years. They can pay me or get out. It's not right. You can't. No, wait! I'm doing you a favor. This isn't you. No! You can't make this decision for me. You can't take away my inheritance! My family worked this land and everything on it! It's mine! Oh, god, my DNA. Oh, god. No one's gonna ever believe that I did it. Crazy party, huh? Yeah, it was. Come here, Sally. Hey, easy, Drake. Hey, hey, hey, stop, easy. Stop it. Stop it! - Shh. - Stop it. I don't want to, help! You don't want your friends to see you like this. Get off me. Get off, get off me. I liked you, Drake. I know. I knew you were a mistake. Damn it! Sally! I'm afraid we've been receiving some complaints of noise from the neighbors. What? We're at least half a mile from anyone else. Well, you know, sound carries pretty far out here in the country. Never know how far it can go. Well, maybe you two boys should come in and inspect the party. Well, if you think it's necessary. You must stay and join the party. That's very neighborly. Oh, we're all neighbors here in River Ridge. You know, you boys don't have to worry too much about the noise coming from upstairs. Most of the noise seems to be coming from the swimsuit models in the hot tub. Swimsuit models? I hired 'em to be escorts. Ah, hostesses, hostesses, to give tours and things like that. You know, we have every possible type of woman here tonight. Anything you can imagine. Well, I don't know. Look at that, my watch is slow. Steve, we're, we're off-duty, buddy. Great, great! The hot tub is this way, boys. Go get 'em, killers. Aaron! Keep them from going upstairs. I don't care what you have to do. I don't want them to see those bodies until after the party. I'll try my best. You do that. Listen, get them something to drink, quickly, something fruity with a lot of vodka. I know that drink. Listen, I don't care if you have to chain them to the hot tub. Just keep them from going upstairs. OK. Now I only have five million dollars to comfort me in my time of grief. We all must learn to endure, Mr. Murphy. Oh, well, that's life. And death. That's the circle of life. And death. To life. And death! What made you want to become a cop? Thought I'd look good in the uniform. Oh, yes. You girls ready to hit the hot tub? Oh, yes. Let's do it. Whoa, careful, Shirley. I don't bite much. Don't be such a show-off. It is so tight and uncomfortable. Hey, look how tight the straps are. It is really tight. Ooh, bad boy! Well, I think it's only fair if you take these off. See? I bet you were chafing. Oh, it's better, so much better. Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't realize there was another event going on here tonight. I'm so sorry to intrude. Sally! What the fuck is this? There's another event going on here. I'm so sorry, again. I'm sorry. Oh, man. They are too precious. They are so cute. Drake, do not be rude, Drake. Why? What are they gonna do? Frown at me? So come on. What the hell is this? A birthday party for a midget? Who's the big honoree? Hey, that's a nice word for little people. Aw, come on, darling. Why don't you sit on my lap and tell me what you want for Christmas? Oh, shit. Oh! No, don't stab him, please! Please! Drake! No! Sally? Sally? Please, what are you doing? Stop! Help me please! No! Leave him alone! No! Stop! Please! The eclipse is beautiful tonight. Isn't it? And you look so handsome in the moonlight. Do I? Hello? Hello, nice little people? Hello, nice little murderers? Vicious little felons? Anyone? Hey, what's up, dude? I need a drink. All right. Make it a triple. Triple it is. Here you go. Harry! What would you like to do? Would you like to start there? If you've got the fuel, baby. I've got what? You've got the fuel. Oh, Ryan, no! How could you love me? This is a terrible party. Now you think this is a terrible party? Be gone with yourself. Go. Anybody want some cake? I'll have a slice. What do you feel? Who wants some cake? I don't like the way you're looking at me. I just can't believe it. Oh my god. They got a girl. Oh my god, now that is just wrong. I'm not afraid of some drunk idiots. We need a flamethrower. Go ahead. Scream. I'm used to it. Crazy night, huh? Good party, though. It's been too long. Who are you? I apologize. Being dead and forced to consort with the lowest levels of society has left my manners a bit rusty. I am Captain Bruce William Campbell, late of the Confederate Army of Atlanta, Georgia, deceased June the 23rd, 1864. Oh. I'm Sally. I'm talking to a ghost? You're a ghost? A dead man? In the flesh. So to speak. What are those things? Demons. My own personal demons. Don't worry, they won't come near me. You're safe as long as I'm here. Please don't leave. I've got all the time in the world. No worries. Damn it. I finally meet a nice guy, and he's dead. I am certain a lovely young lady such as yourself must have many suitors. The man I came here to meet tonight was murdered. Not that there's anything wrong with being dead. Don't spill my drink, Mauricio. Don't worry, I'll get you another one. So the demons came upon me and attacked in a most unfair and cowardly fashion. I fought bravely, but I was overpowered. They killed you? That cannon you see on the grass, I was tied across the front of the muzzle and the fuse was ignited. Oh, that's terrible. I felt so hollow for so long. And now? Just sort of empty all over. I can feel you a little bit. It's the eclipse. How am I gonna get out of here? Why, I shall be your escort. I wish there was something that could be done. Some things cannot be undone. That is a hard lesson to learn. A lot of ladies here tonight. Yeah, yeah, blue. Ten. Black? A five. Well, well, what can I get you, miss? I'm Rita, darling. I'm Aaron. Aren't you adorable? Oh, I could just eat you up. Mmm, OK. So what do you suggest? Oh, the possibilities are endless. How about your favorite? My favorite? Come here. Keep drinking, keep drinking. You are so beautiful. Oh, take it easy, tiger. There's plenty of time. Oh, yeah? Is that right? Wouldn't want you to go off half-cocked. Oh, no chance of that. You're so sexy. Oh, this was fun. Yes, it was. I'm starving. Yeah, me too. I gotta get back to work. - No. - Yeah, yeah, it's my job. - No. - I gotta do it. Stay just a little bit longer, yeah? - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Why not? Yeah? Just a little longer? - Yes. - OK. Thanks, darling. You're so pretty. Good night. Come to Papa. Another reason I don't get a ride home from a party. Certainly he did not deserve this. You don't know him. He looks a fine fellow. Appearances can be deceiving. Is this wise? I'm not gonna leave him hanging up here for everyone to see. This party sucks enough without people thinking my date hanged himself. I'm sure they would not think that. I would be honored to be your date at a. You don't know the year 2012. Is that what year it is? Funny, it seems only yesterday it was 1920 and I first moved here. Time does get away from us all, huh? True. Catch him! I've got him. Bruce? Bruce! Bruce, are you hurt? Bruce! How could I be hurt when I'm already dead? Bruce? Drake? Bruce? Oh, my. Oh my god. My diary's not gonna believe this one. They may not come into the light, but let us not chance it. I'd hate to get murdered again so soon. We've gotta get out of this water. I'm starting to prune up. I can take you upstairs and dry you off there. Hey, cutie. Hello. How you doing? Good. You're not a cop, are you? No. Good. Hi. Where'd your friends go? Upstairs. Wanna join them? Sure. Oh my god. No, wait, I can explain! That guy is a freak. They're dead. They're dead bodies. You should do something. We have to call the cops. You are the cops. But I haven't done anything more than a breaking and entering, and that was a kid's bike. We have to get Steve. Fake! I knew it. You both aren't supposed to be up here. Mr. Murphy would be very cross. There are dead bodies in those bedrooms. Well, then what's a few more? Oh, lovely girl. Hi. I'm here with the football team. You were like in a cemetery? Smell good. Ugh, get away. Can I get you a drink? Bruce, I mean Drake, Drake, what would you like to drink? Would you happen to have whiskey? I have whole cases of it. You'll like this. Is it good? It's, it's heaven. Union currency? Bruce, Drake, yeah, there's something I need to tell you about the Civil War. The Union won. How was I to know? I thought the Confederacy won! OK, we have to talk about civil rights too and emancipation. Really, we do. I will listen. Being dead broadens one's perspective. I can't believe that. I love you. Oh, sorry. Oh. "He was buried with all his internal organs intact." "19th dynasty." Jesus. 3,000 years old, huh? You look pretty good for your age, partner. I'm sorry. Not funny, dude. Oh, man, that's not fair. Hey, back off, lefty! You're the only one going hungry at the all-you-can-eat buffet. I friggin' hate parties. I'm having such a wonderful time tonight. Really? I met a guy. I think I met him. Isn't he wonderful? Yes, wonderful. Is there a lady in your life? Isn't that wonderful that there's someone in the world for everyone? I see you. I thought I told you not to go near the pool area. Mom said it was OK though. She said I could borrow trunks. Did you also tell her that I told you not to go? I don't have to. No, you don't. Not anymore. What? I guess you boys have to grow up someday. What are you talking about? Sarah, are you OK? Gunner fell into the door. Who? Gunner. He's gone. Republican's army said to the Democrat vampire, "I'm tired of your bleeding heart liberal agenda." So you finally hooked up with Drake? Good for you. Uh. He's the life of the party. He's not real. I beg your pardon. You're not real. Ephemeral spirit comes the dawn, poof! Poof? What are you talking about? I'm a witch, Sally. I can tell he's a ghost. Of course. Did you... You're a witch? What did you do with Drake's soul? - Nothing. - We haven't seen anything with Drake and Drake's soul. Are you responsible for the powers unleashed here tonight? "Witch" rhymes with "bitch," honey. Don't push me, I've had a bad night. You're not tied to the real world. You're inhabiting the body of a dead man, and when the eclipse ends or the spell's sundered, you're going to go, and not through the front door. Isn't there anything you can do to help Bruce? Well, there may be one thing. - Anything. - Anything. Earth magic. You have to have sex with each other. You have to breathe the air, drink and eat and have sex. That might bind you back to the earth. I have done the first three. However, Miss Sally is not the sort who would even entertain such a perverted notion. We're not engaged, let alone married. I'm sure you can get laid at this party. Try the hot tub. Hot tub? Yeah, there's a lot of action going on there. Must be the weather. Fine, all right, I'll do it. We all must have sacrifices to fight evil. It just doesn't seem right. We're not engaged. We're not married. You're not that sort of woman. Oh, just shut up. I have a new face. How odd. I think you're very handsome. I suppose after 145 years, I could use a change. Well, come on, already. You're stalling. Are you sure? It's not 1864 anymore. I miss it. I know. What was it like? It was a completely different world. That changed one day at a time until I was the only thing left of it. I never realized how lonely I was until I looked into your eyes. I want out. I want out. You can make a run for it. OK, we get a bunch of people together, we could make it to the gate. I really screwed up. I did too. All that wasted worry. I waited years for someone who didn't want me. I'm sorry. It happens every day. Guess it does. Where's Mark? I have no idea. I gotta go find him. Yeah, what's waiting outside the gate? Nothing. There is nothing outside the gate. I'm not just gonna sit here and wait. Well, I can wait 'til someone else goes first. I suggest you kill yourselves. If you're murdered by supernatural creatures, your soul will be damned to walk the earth until the end of time. It's been a very busy night. Get some rest. And sweet dreams. Oh, my god,. I'm sorry. I can't find my date. Where'd you see him last? George went to the front gate to get the car. What's your name? Olivia. I'm Mark. I don't think we're gonna be able to make it to the front gate. OK. How about the house at the top of the hill? We can go there and get help or wait until morning. I don't wanna stay here, OK? Let's get out. Is anyone there? Open up! I can hear someone. Please, please, help us! Please! For the love of God, open the door! Who are you, and what do you want? We're not supposed to open the door after dark. Do you have a landline? We need to call the police. A landline? A telephone. Do you have a telephone? Well, of course we have a telephone. You must let us call the police. There's been a murder. Several. How many murders? Five. We're not supposed to open the door after dark. Come in, then, and hurry, if it's a police matter. Come on. I'm Natalie, and this is my sister Millicent. Is your power out? No. Can you turn the lights on? That's a bad idea, not on the eclipse. It's the night of the blood moon. Telephone? Oh, right there. 911? 911? 911, what's your emergency? There's been a murder. Where are you? The Mayhew mansion estate. That place is abandoned. It's on our patrol route. What the hell are you talking about? There's been five murders here tonight. What night is it? I can't remember the damn date! Our records show that the Mayhew estate's abandoned. It's already on our patrol route. You have to come. Send all the cops you can. There's a serial killer loose at Mason Murphy's lunar eclipse viewing party at the old Mayhew mansion estate. Stop making prank calls. Someone might actually need to use the emergency service line. There's been a lot of calls tonight. Listen to me, listen, listen. This is no prank call, this is a murder call. Murder's been done here tonight, murder most foul! A detective was shot. And clubbed on the head! And then the caterer tried to poison the event planner! And someone stabbed him in the back! And then the hostess drank the poison drink! And poor Elijah was torn to shreds in an empty room with no one else with him! Please, please just help us! We need help here! Stop making prank calls. How awful. Are they sending the police? No. They don't believe us. They never do. Oh, you must stay with us until it's safe. You can't go back down there tonight. We can't open the door again. Thank you, thank you. Please don't make us go back down there. Of course not, we won't. Not on this night. I'll make some tea. - Cookies. - Oh yes! You must help me find Gunner. I have to find Gunner. He was the one. It'll never end. We're trapped here forever. We're all going to die, trapped here under the dark moon. Well, we all have to die sometime. You say it like you think we're going to die now. Because we are going to die now. People are dropping like flies, and one by one they're being murdered, until the last one alive kills himself, just like Morgan Mayhew. Well, I am not dying tonight. I am going to find Gunner. I told her. I told you all. We're all cursed. I hate to ask, do you, do you guys have any guns? I mean, to defend yourselves, in case something comes to the door? Oh, I don't hold with guns. Heavens, no. We'd probably blow our brains out. Accidentally. By accident. I am so glad you guys are here. There, there, dear. Have an almond cookie. It's my special recipe. It's delicious. Thank you. No, no, thank you. I can't eat anything. Imagine how we feel, living up here all alone. Olivia? Olivia? Olivia! Olivia! You poisoned our tea. Oh, we wouldn't poison the tea. Everybody's drinking tea. You poisoned the cookies? It's my special recipe. I put in extra cyanide. Almonds have cyanide, you know. It enhances the flavor of the cookie. One day, I'll eat one. You fucking bitch! You bitch! Which one? Both of you! You just killed her? You killed Olivia? Oh, that's not fair. I didn't poison the almond cookies. Manners must be taught. Rules must be obeyed. We mustn't open the door after dark. Never on the night of the blood moon. Let go! Let go! Godammit! God! Crazy old chickens, someone ought to wring your neck! Oh, have a cookie, Millicent. Soon. Someday soon. Tony! Tony, oh, Tony! I fear he did not fare well. Are you making a dining joke? That's macabre, dog. Where've you been? This man's been torn to shreds and you make jokes? I have been dead for the past 148 years. I have to end this, or we'll be trapped here. What do you mean? If the spell isn't broken, we'll be trapped here until we're all dead. We're outside of everything here, completely alone, removed from even the mind of God. I wanted to talk to Frank about that lottery ticket. A freaking lottery ticket? You raised the dead for a lottery ticket? Did he have it? No. Hmm, tough luck. We can't go on to the next cycle of years until the spell is broken. Until then, we're not even in reality. Anything is possible. Anything. How do we break the spell? I don't know, but I'm gonna try. That means it didn't work, right? Hey, Sally, hold on, be careful out there! It must be something else. It wasn't the calendar stone. That's a waste of a good body. It must be Morgan. Great-Uncle Morgan Mayhew. I've always felt strangely connected to him. I look just like him. What's it mean? Where's the body? Are you enjoying the party? Kill me! My body! I know how you feel. Burn my body! Oh, I've had a night, too. Burn my body! Have a good night. Oh my god! Oh my god! Great-Uncle Morgan! He was rolled up in the carpet? For 92 years. After all this time, I did not even notice. What do we do? I do not know. Let's burn the body. What about that witch's spell book? I was a ballerina, you know. I loved to dance. I know you loved to dance. Do you need a ride to go home? I'm Mirabelle Mayhew. Morgan Mayhew was my husband. You look good, Morgan. The years have been good to you. He stole all that money. I didn't want to have anything more to do to with him. I tried to leave Morgan, but he forced me to move into the mansion. I fought him that first night. It's a nightmare that's never left me. You fought Morgan Mayhew, and all that blood all over the house? That was Morgan's. He suffered in the end. I was a very strong ballet dancer once upon a time. My god, you must be... 112 years old. I've waited a long time. I lived because I knew I was needed on this night. I saw him in visions. Each year, it grew stronger. Morgan set powerful forces in play when he built this mansion. Then why on you? I kept it for luck. Happy anniversary, darling. Sally, Sally, don't let go of me. I won't! I'll never let go, Bruce! Mirabelle, my love. Well, it's been fun. Is it too late for a nightcap? No, ma'am, it's not too late for a nightcap. It's an honor to know you and be in your presence. That was weird. I've never seen anything like it. Nonsense, this is nothing. But look at that skeleton. It has bite marks on its bones. I was in Afghanistan. Now, keep an eye to business. We've gotta get these folks into the crematorium before sundown. Hey! What are you stumbling around for? Get on clean-up detail! I don't want this place stinking of pain, flesh, and demons. Get to it. It looks like a slip-and-fall accident right there. OK. That's kitchen accident. Freezer burn. Cardiac arrest right there. That one, we'll come back to that one. Oh, oh my god, that one's still alive. Hunting accident. It's a tragedy. A terrible, terrible tragedy. I'll say. But it all worked out in the end. What? I got a dump that's on the real estate market at a very attractive price today, so get to it. I can't find Trixie's body. Oh well. It was a hell of a party, and I ended up a richer man for it, so I'm not going to dock her fee for dying on the job. I am in a generous, generous mood. Why, thank you, Mr. Murphy. You're welcome. I really appreciate it. Very, very much. It's a beautiful day. Foul, that was most foul, number 37. OK, calm down, Bruce. It's only a game. Didn't you get any rest last night? Baby, you look half dead. Do I? I'm trying to be more alive. I wish they'd stop showing that. What's going on? Is it war? When is it not? Thank God we live in Iowa, where nothing bad ever happens. No, nothing bad ever happens here. Who cares what's going on halfway around the world? Frankly, I'm sick of it. What are these? Let me see those. I thought that would be the end.
