- Shalini, slow down. Slow down. - Kevin, it's no useto stop me. - Slow down. Slow down. - Kevin, don't be boring. - Slow down. - Wow! Oh, it's fun! That's nice. Shalini Chauhan. Congratulations, Shalini. Thank you so much. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Thanks. - Thanks. - Congratulations, Shalini. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Smile. Kevin, I've been sitting here for the last hour. It's hurting now. Two minutes. - What? - Nothing. What will you do after I go? I will find someone else who won't move so much. You won't find anyone better than me. It's what you think. - Wll you miss me? - Wll you marry me? Why? Because I'm a Christian? Or because you have a wealthy father.. ...or now you have officially become abetter painter than me. Doesn't dad approve of you? Religion is very important for him. And he will never allow me.. - And you? - I don't believe in religion. Then? - I am used to a certain lifestyle, Kevin. I've got whatever I wanted right from my childhood. And the best of it. Perhaps it won't be possible for meto leave that lifestyle.. ...all of a sudden now, Kevin. If you wanted this then why did you make those lofty promises? What are you doing? - Washing my sins off. - What sins? I lied to you. I wash my sins off when I lie. Always. Kevin. What do you do, Kevin? I am an artist. Shalini is an artist too. What do you do for a living? - People buy my paintings too. - Really? Come with me. I'll show you something interesting. Come. Follow me. Do you see these paintings? This is for Rs.75,000. And this one is for Rs.1.5 lakh. Andthis painting is for Rs.3 lakh. And none of these is a masterpiece. The masterpieces are hanging in my bedroom. You know, the Thakurs, the Roys, Shreshtas and Desais. Tell me one thing, Kevin. How much do the people pay for your paintings? Kevin, let's elope. - What? - We will run away somewhere else. Karim, click a photo of that spot. - Sir, barrister has come. - Send him in. - Good morning. - Good morning, Nilesh. It's been a long time. Five months and 21 days. - Please. - Thank you. Tell me, what can I do for you? - Yes. It's my daughter's wedding. - Oh! Congrats. Thank you. When is it? - Tomorrow. Sorry for the short notice. I see. So, now tell me the real reason for coming here. Kevin Toraso case. That's an open and shut case. There are the fingerprints, motive, he has been.. ...arrested from the murder spot. It's all there. So, hang him. That's the problem, it's too simple. 2006 Roy, 2007 Thakur, everyone knows.. ...he is responsible for those fakes. There is no evidence, he got free. What are you thinking? What do you exactly want, Dixit? I told you, Nilesh. It is the duty of the police to arrest the suspect. It is work of the court to release him or accuse him as a criminal. So, you have done your job. They don't call you for nothing, Nilesh. You must have read the witness statements. Mr. Ramprasad, when do you open your shop? Sir, I run a dairy business. It opens at 5am and shuts at 8-9pm. Can you tell us who would come to meet madam? The customers did come to purchase the paintings. But Mr. Kevin had come that night. Around 9pm, I saw him entering the house with madam. Then in the evening when he started to go home.. ...that time too he didn't leave the house. And in the morning? I saw sir entering the house at 7am again. I too entered the house five minutes later, sir. 'Murder!' Did anyone else visit madam's house often? - Mr.Aditya. He would come often and he came that night too. But then he left. Ramprasad is right, sir. I've often seen Aditya visiting Shalini's house. What did you hear a night before the murder? I heard Shalini's screams too. "I will kill you. I will kill you." I heard her cries too. Can you tell us who was upstairs at that time? He was there. Anyone else? And Aditya would visit her. Okay, tell me, who else visited madam's house? Yes, sir. The one who drives the plane would also come. You mean a pilot? Yes, sir. One man would come wearing such a uniform. On Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday. Around 7am in a blue Maruti car. But sir, that was a Friday, but he did come. He came at 7am and left at 7:15am. Do you remember that car number? Car number? 7546? No. 6574. It was something like that, sir. Can you tell us which airlines is it? What did you find out about that pilot? He was my brother, Anurag. - How do you know? - He told me himself. His car number is 4756. It's a blue Maruti. Have you told that to anyone yet? If this matter is revealed, his family will fall apart, Nilesh. He did love Shalini but he didn't murder her. He had not gone to meet her that day too. Are you sure? No. That's whyl'vecometo you. It's evident from his words that he is telling the truth. I've been in this field since last 25 years. I've seen so much that I really don'tknow. The search for the pilot is still on. You know, it's like looking for a needle in ahaystack. I know that, Nilesh. But one day, the secret will be revealed. I need your help. - Thank you so much, Nilesh. - Anytime. - Thank you once again. - You are welcome. No one can win this game except me. Don't be over-confident. Come on, stop the game. Come on. Buddy, are you weaving a sari for sister-in-law? Where were you since the morning? Work, Buddy. I have to work. Actually, whatever I've earned by working hard.. ...I have to give it to someone. What do I want? Kevin, someone has come to meet you. I never thought that I will meet you here. Here? I never expected to meet you again. I had read in the newspapers. I came to Mumbai yesterday for some office work. You are looking beautiful. Did you do it, Kevin? No. No, I did not. I didn't meet Shalini that day. Where were you that day? I am telling you, I had a flight. Try to understand, Anurag. One pilot was spotted visiting her house at 7am.. ...and he left from there after 15 minutes. That's impossible. That's alie! I was caught in traffic at 7am on that day. I had a flight. I am telling you. No smoking, Anurag. It's a government office. Did you notice any change in Shalini during the last few days? Yes, she seemed fearful due to some reason. She was fearful? Any reason? I don't know that. She never told me. And she had started drinking a lot from last few days. Does your wife know about Shalini? No, she doesn't know that. She shouldn't know this please. How did you meet Shalini? At one painting exhibition. Uma was along with me. And she purchased Shalini's painting too. What did you want from her, Anurag? Aman visits the other woman after marriage.. ...only for two reasons. Physical intimacy or love. Which was it for you? You didn't want to be together? - I couldn't leave Uma. - Why? They don't have any children. She suffers from acute depression. - And Shalini? - What? Didn't she want you both to be together.. She never spoke about it. What do you know about her past? She would stay in Delhi. She was a painter. She had come to Mumbai two years ago. That's it. Tell me something, Anurag. Didn't you get any official transport or car from the airlines? I prefer to drive my own car when I part from the airport. - 'So, what is it? - What?.' 'A birthday, some anniversary?' 'Or any quarrel because of these two reasons?' 'What is it?' 'But how do you know that?' 'Did you see anyone else therein these clothes?' 'l was waiting for my husband here.' 'It's our first anniversary today.' 'We will have dinner together. But as usual.' 'As usual, Akshay called up at the last moment.. ...that he has some urgent work and he has to go to Bangalore.' 'Kevin? Kevin?' What do you think, Nilesh? Strange. She was a professional painter. She was earning well. Good clients. But still there is no one except Kevin.. ...who knows more about her. Nilesh Bhargav. Kevin, I want to help you.. ...if you are innocent. I'd like you to tell me the entire truth. You said in the court that you know Shalini.. ...from last eight years. You loved her. You were going to marry her. But she didn't come, I mean she didn't turn up. 'Kevin, let's elope.' Am I correct? So you have a motive. Although not a very strong one but still, you have a motive. You came from Calcutta to Mumbai on August 24th.. ...and you met Shalini that night. And shewas murdered thenext morning. I am not entirely convinced. You want to say that from last eight years.. ...you were not in terms with each other? And suddenly after eight years you clashed with her.. ...in an unknown city on the first night. And the next morning she was murdered. - Yes. Tell me something, Kevin. Where did you meet her? And what exactly happened that night? I have said this many times in the court, sir. Please say it once again for my sake. 'Kevin?' 'All the trolleys drowned in the storm that night.' 'Dad's business was finished.' 'He was devastated. He fell sick.' 'l couldn't have left him in that condition.' 'l visited your house on the next day.' 'But you had already left.' 'l kept on waiting. Then we shifted to Delhi.' 'Dad wanted to get me married in arich family.' 'l had not reason to refuse too.' 'My husband was settled in Dubai.' 'The only thing he was interested in was physical intimacy.' 'Dad passed away after two years.' 'There was nothing left in Goa, so, I stayed at Delhi..' '..for two more years.' 'Then I shifted to Mumbai.' That place? I didn't go. I waited for you. Kevin, you have changed a lot in these eight years. You even look so different. Total corporate types, right? Or you would've own a chain of saloons. Sorry. Dad would've probably approved if he would've seen you now. I never heard your name till eight years. - Do you still paint? - No. Aditya, this is Kevin. He is my old friend. Can you imagine, we have met after eight years! Kevin, this is Aditya. Well, he is studying Engineering. Heis a bright young boy. Aditya, why don't you join us? You had an appointment with Dr. Sushila today. I know, Adi, actually I met Kevin after so many years.. Yes. Right. Bye. Why did you have an appointment with the doctor? Traction. As old-age symptom. Didn't you get prone to it till now? Where I've kept the money? Where is the jewellery? I don't remember anything. I wonder where I misplace my earrings and bangles. Then I never find them again. I think I'm just losing it. And Aditya? Why does he visit the doctor? He just drives me there. You loved to drive, didn't you? There is no joy of driving in Mumbai. You are stuck in traffic for hours. I'll get it. Kevin, he is just a wealthy father's son.. ...who just wants to sleep with me, but I don't. I haven't. I think I'll make a move. I've an appointment. You still hold it against me, don't you, Kevin? It was not easy for me. I visited your house but you were gone. You didn't even give me that chance. It is an eight years old matter, Shalini. Let's move on. No, Kevin. It was very difficult for me to ignore that person.. ...who had done so much for me after my mother. It was a very difficult decision for me to make. But that you didn't realise. Because for you, everything had to be in black or white. Do or die. Everything had to beat the press of a button. You must be feeling very happy.. ...to seeme in this condition, don't you? An alcoholic. No life. And still holding on to my past as if.. - Look, Shalini. - Don't look Shalini me, Kevin. Your ego was hurt because I was unable.. ...to take a decision right then. Because how can anyone but your lordship.. ...ever use any decision, right? Good night, Shalini.- Yes, Of course. Of course, good night. You will say this because you must be feeling that you are.. ...standing in front of a whore, to whom young boys.. ...come late in the night for a bang. Enough, Shalini! I wasn't feeling well. I returned to my hotel, and after that.. ...I was at the bar the whole night. That's true. The bar manager had given this statement. And you came to meet Shalini in the morning again, right? 'Shalini! Shalini?' 'Murder! Murder! Murder!' Two head injuries were detected in Shalini. According to the post mortem report.. ...one was an old wound and other was a fresh injury. Can you tell us anything about this old injury? - No. Did Shalini ever tell you anything about her fear? She was completely changed. I wouldn't have known even if she had any fear. Why did you come to Mumbai? Why, Kevin? Why? For a painting assignment. And who is Rati Bose? She is my friend. What did you do after you left Goa? I would work for a clearing and furbearing company. - Where? - Trizona. Delhi. - Then? - It was not a fixed job, sir. And why.. Abroad or Paris? Scholarship. A painter was selected every year.. ...and Shalini was selected that year. According to the post-mortem report.. ...Shalini was murdered between 7-8am in the morning. Kevin was presentat the bar the whole night. It's possible that he returned and killed her in the morning. But I am just not convinced, you know. Adita has a ticket for Kochi. And it is not used so.. And Rati Bose. We don't know anything about her. And Anurag? Anurag has no LMl. The injury which Shalini got at night.. ...it was possible only in Kevin's presence. And Kevin is lying, Nilesh. He is lying. The blood was fresh, Dixit. Yeah, I know. I know. But it is possible that Kevin had come there in the morning to check.. ...and he found that Shalini is alive and that time he.. It's possible. Deception in love. An old wound. Revenge. It's possible. He can do it. Aditya can do it too out of jealousy. - And Anurag.. - Blackmail? Yes, sir. Guru, what are you thinking? I'm thinking why do they both want to save me.. ...today all of a sudden? Remember my advice. Never trust a woman. How long has it been since someone has come here? - I guess a month. Right? - Yes, about that time. Do you have anyone from the forensic department.. ...who can work of fthe record? Yes, I have. Get this grill scanned. And match it. I will. "Come to my place for sometime, my darling." "Come here for some time." Ramprasad! He is Mr. Bhargav. He wants to make enquiries. Hello. I'm always at your service. Legally yours, sir. Mr. Ramprasad, how many such packets do you prepare everyday? Sir, this is a whole day's work. It goes on. The day Shalini was murdered here.. ...had you seen the pilot and Kevin coming here? Yes, sir. And you had also told about a blue Maruti carin the court? Yes, sir. Where was it parked? Over there, sir. Actually, that parking place is Mrs. Malkani's. She leaves in the morning to drop her children to school. Mr. Ramprasad, there are thousands of.. - ...blue Maruti cars in this city. - Yes, sir. So, perhaps it might be somebody else's car? It might not be of that pilot? Sir, I had seen them going inside the house. And while going back? The blue Maruti? Sir, I didn't see it. I did not pay attention. - Sir! - Yes. Mrs. Dixit has come to meet you. Dixit?! Mrs. Dixit? Mrs. Anurag Dixit. What can I do for you? Mrs. Dixit? Anurag did not kill Shalini, Mr. Bhargav. Did you know about both of them? I'm his wife. How can you say confidently that Anurag.. I've told you that I'm his wife. Anurag can do anything but.. He cannot kill somebody. Please don't cry. He is innocent. Please don't cry. I become very uncomfortable. I just become nervous when women cry. - Please.. - Heis innocent. Yes, I'm sure, he is, but.. How can you know this? Look, Mrs. Dixit. A girl has been murdered. Your husband Anurag is just a suspect as of now. Nobody knows abou tit. Nothing has been proved yet. You know! Mr. Bhargav, just a small request. Please. Nobody should know that I had cometo meet you today. Sure. I promise you. Thank you. Please allow me. Thank you. Good night, Mrs. Dixit. Good night. Mrs. Dixit, I know that you are Anurag's wife. But how did you think of coming to me? I heard him talking to commissioner. For the first time in his life, your papais slightly confused, dear. Papais smart, right? Blue Oranges. The very quest for happiness leads us away from it. It takes us to many a shore to getaway from the real goal. A real happiness lies within the confines of our own selves. Seek not in the world what lies.. What not.. "To the conflicting thoughts." "To wayward paths." "What is your promise to them?" "What is your promise?" "Oh, life, tell me." "What is your intention?" "What is your intention?" "Even in crowd everybody is walking lonely." "'Everybody is burning in their own fire." "What is the fault? What kind of punishment?" "Why do we lose even after winning?" "Oh, life, tell me." "What is your intention?" Can I drop you somewhere? Yes, sure. Thanks. How much? What?! You are giving a wrong person a ride, sweetheart. I'm not a strumpet. First left and straight. "Tell me, O life.. ...what's your intention?" How long was Shalini staying with you? Around one and a half years. Can you tell something about her? She was a good girl. She would pay the rent on time. She was a pleasure seeking girl. Drinks, many men. Even on that night, there was a sound of a drink bottle breaking. Sir, we are ordinary people. Rent is very important for us. With this court and polic matters, I'll be finished. Mr. Goel, can you tell me something about that night? There was sound of fighting. Two-three times. - Two or three? - Four. The fourth scream was heard 15 minutes after the third. You've told in thec ourt that you heard Shalini saying.. "I'll kill you." Fourth scream. There was a male voice too. I'll kill you. There was a man's voice after the third scream too. But 'I'll kill you' was after the fourth scream. Who was upstairs? Must be Kevin. We didn't see him going out. Mr. Goel, you didn't see him while coming in? Ramprasad told that in the court. When you heard Shalini saying 'I'll kill you..' Didn't you go up and check? Check? Sir, Shalini would scream even when alone. There was sound of her crying many times. On that night we had dinner and wereon bed to sleep. Who else stays with you? Our son Hari. He is studying inside. Third time. He has failed twice. Hari also heard the sound of fights. Would you like to meet him? Why not? Please come. Hari! Dear Hari! Open the door, Hari. Hari, please open the door. Hari, what happened? Son, he is Mr. Bhargav. He wants to talk about Shalini. I won't take much of your time. What were you doing? I dosed off while I was reading. - You were sleeping? - Yes. - Where? - What do you mean? I mean, on the bed or on the table while reading. Here? Good. Did you hear anything on that night, Hari? Yes. Thesound of fighting. How many hours do you study in a day? 12 to 15 hours. On this table? You were reading here on that night. Did you see somebody coming and going? No. That side is blocked. Do you know Shalini? No.. After waking up from sleep, firstly, you comb your hair. Because your hair are not dishevelled at all. Let's go. Thank you. My pleasure. Jailor! Such mistakes should not be repeated again. Your case can get weakened with such reports. Why do you both want to help me? Just a lack of occupation. When you left Shalini's house on that night.. ...had you closed the door? Perhaps, I did. Tell me something, Kevin. Did you really not know anything about that old injury? No. Nilesh, some information has been obtained from Rati Bose. In the last onea nd a half months.. ...she had come to Mumbai twice. She had come on 25th too. The day Shalini was murdered. She had come for just one day. She is coming again today. I want to know why I've been brought here. Is this a way? Madam, why do you get angry at me? You talk to the boss. Call your superiors now. I want an explanation now. Boss has arrived. - Rati Bose? - Yes. Weare talking about Kevin Toraso. You know him. Heis in our custody right now. We want to get some matters clarified. That's all. So to get some matters clarified, you bring.. ...people here in this manner? I'm sorry. We apologise for that. When this incident occurred, madam.. On Friday 25th last month. You were in Mumbai? You came to Mumbai by the first flight. Yes. I had a meeting with SCM bank chairman. This incident occurred early in the morning. I don't think bankers have their meeting early in the morning. Even the ones that don't sleep. What time was your meeting? At 11 o'clock. Your flight had landed at 6 o'clock. I had a room booked in hotel Continental. You can check their records. And office always books a room for methere. How did you find out about themurder? I read in newspapers. Right. Thank you. Thank you. Can I leave now? Of course, you may leave. When we need you, I'll call. And when you need to be summoned, you should come. Of course, I understand your anxiety. But you should have told once what you areup to? We'll call our witness. Dear, papa is a bit confused. Can you help? You think this will help? Shewas suffering from sciatica. That's why I had advised traction to her. Was it very painful? Sometimes, yes. And to add her alcohol problems. That only added to them. Did someone usually accompany her? Aditya Mehra. On that day, you had gone to Kochi by a flight, Aditya. - Am I right? - Our branch officer.. Aditya will reply, Mr. Mahra. Tell me, Aditya. The night before when Kevin.. ...left from Shalini's house at about 11:30 at night. You were standing outside then. Near your red Mercedes. Right? I know that you have said something else in the court. But I think this is the truth. Mr. Bhargav, Aditya was at home. Aditya! Did you know Shalini? Yes. Thank you for being honest. Mr. Bhargav, we are honourable and responsible citizens. Aditya, a fight before murder you had gone to meet Shalini. Correct? Why? She had an appointment with doctor. How did you both meet for the first time? She could not get an auto or a taxi. I was passing from there. I offered her lift. Your son is respectable, responsible and helpful person. Tell me Aditya, was Kevin there on that night.. ...when you had gone to meet Shalini? Yes. Had you met him before that? No. Did Kevin know you? How? You have a red Mercedes, Aditya? Then how did Kevin Toraso find out that you've a red Mercedes? Tell me, Shalini's bedroom window opens towards the factory. How did Kevin see you near the car, Aditya? - Let me tell you.. - How? Please. I was not there at that time. I had gone home straight. I got embarrassed today because of you. Only because you got involved with a woman, who.. Aditya, I just hope you are not telling lies. No, dad. I swear. He is lying. How do you know? Where was Anurag on that night? I didn't ask. Perhaps Aditya had returned. But he said he was in Kochi. That's what his manager says. And he was the only one at the branch. But how did Kevin find out that Aditya has a red Mercedes? Shalini's bedroom window doesn't open towards the road. Nilesh, is it possible that Kevin knew before hand that.. ...Aditya has such a car. It's possible. I didn't think about it. When is the next hearing? Thursday. I think perhaps he'll get abail. Your magic is great. Good morning, sir. Sir! That woman! She used to come to Shalini. Today sheis in veil. I had not seen her in a veil before. Who killed her, Kevin? I don't know. You still love her, don't you? 8 years before.. Yes. Nothing else mattered. And after 8 years? I just feel sad. So? What is your plan now? I'll hire a good lawyer who will keep me away from that place. I don't understand why they want to help me. First they had put me in jail and then.. ...the same people want to save me. But why are you getting involved in this along with me? Meeting with you just on one night has changed my life, Kevin. And whatever has happened between us.. ...I've told Akshay everything about it. It is anew life for me. So, yes, I owe that to you. Good. I could be of use to you for something. When are you going back? I'm not going back. I've taken 15 days leave. Hey! What do you want? I want a packet. Who has sent you? - Dixit. Commissioner Dixit. - Why? I'm a poor man, sir. I had sent it last month to the police station. Mr. Promod and Kini had come together. Both took it, sir. What do you sell? What? Narcotics? Drugs? Brown sugar? What do you sell? Drugs. Follow the blue car. Hurry up. Quick. 500,000. It is not possible for me for less than 1 million. What are you saying? Mr. Qasim had told me.. ...that you'll co-operate with us fully. I had agreed to come to Mumbai at Qasim's instance. Otherwise.. I understand. Mr. Kevin, you've asked for 1 million. I agree. But when? It is very late at night, Mr. Mahta. Now you should leave. Yes, it is very late at night. Yes. Before I go, here are 100,000 as advance. And this is the reference. When? I'll phone you. When, Mr. Kevin? One month. Thank you. Thank you so much. What do you do, Kevin? Art agent. I had told you before. I had come to Mumbai for this assignment. You get 1 million for one assignment? If you are an art agent, why these photocopies? Why do you get involved with some thing which you don't know? I'm sorry. You make fakes. Don't you? You make fakes, right? This is the last one. I promise. Trust me. Yes. Where were you the night before the murder, Anurag? I was at home. Uma was with me. I'll have to ask Uma about this. What time was your flight? 8:15. I had enquired. Your flight had got delayed on that night. Am I correct? I've to repeat the same thing again and again. Haven't you seen the airport crossing signal? It's a nightmare. I was stuck in the traffic. I've already told you. - Did Uma know about you and Shalini? - No. Anurag, let's stop playing this cat and mouse game. I want to know the truth. I'm not playing any games. When something happens a family member tries to save. I've not done anything, but you are so mean? Shut up! That's enough. This is not home. This is office. That's enough. What's the matter? What's your problem? What's my problem? You have the answer to it. You've caused it. What do you want to say? Don't try to act innocent. What do you think? Am I a fool? If I stay at home, it means I don't know.. ...what you are doing outside home? What am I doing? Come on, stop it, Anurag. I know everything. About Shalini and you. Don't talk nonsense. What was it? Was she pregnant? Enough! Not a word more, otherwise.. Otherwise what will you do? You'll kill me, right? Shut up. Grill. Liar. How did he get the money! Stealing! It is possible. Stealing from the dead? Only one window in Shalini's room. Mrs. Goel heard screams four times.. Twice.. Hello. Hariprasad Goel. Okay. We have got your fingerprints. You had entered Shalini's house. No. I don't know. You had given a statement that you had not gone to.. ...Shalini's room since last one and a half year. So how is it possible that your fingerprints are there? You've murdered Shalini, darn it. You did. I didn't. - You did! - No. Shut up. You've murdered Shalini. How these fingerprints were found there? You've broken the lock ofher house. Heis lying, Nilesh. He is lying through his teeth. Hari! You used to go out from your window. You used to climb up and you used to enter Shalini's house. She thought she has begun losing her things. She was not losing them. You used to steal. You used to steal. If you tell the truth and help us then.. ...perhaps I'll be able to help you. Otherwise.. The decision is yours. Tell them, son. Tell them. He will help you in some way. Tell him. Yes, I had cut the grill. You used to steal. You still steal. Money, jewellery, etc. Yes. You had gone to Shalini's room to steal. I've not murdered anybody. What else did you notice on that night? I don't know. You used to watch the street from your bathroom window. You've watched the street many times from there. When Shalini used to come and leave.. When the house was empty.. Had you seen somebody coming or going.. ...after Kevin had left? I don't know anything. I have not seen anything.- Sir! The car has been identified. It belongs to Mr. Anurag Dixit. Airline Pilot. Hey! Hari! Catch him. Hari, don't run away! Hari, listen to me! Hari! Don'trun away. Catch him. He's running! Hey, stop! Catch him. Where are you running away? - Dixit! Dixit! - Yes. Hari has not killed Shalini. What do you mean, he didn't? - Just tell you guys not to frighten him. Heis justa drug addict. What do you mean? Dixit, if he had done it, it would have been an impulsive act. Nilesh, heis.. Otherwise his fingerprints would have been found.. ...on the murder weapon also. He has admitted the crime, Nilesh. This murder was planned, Dixit. - Don't let him escape! - Catch him. Sir, I swear, my son is innocent. Please save him, sir. Stop! Where are you running away? Catch him. He's running. Stop him! Stop. Stop. Don't run. Nab him! Catch him. Catch him. Stop. Don'trun. Stop! Excuse me. Move back. - Push them back. - Comeon. Take him to the hospital. Please take him to the hospital right now. Nilesh, I need to meet Anurag. Now! Before the police get to him. Come on. Come on. Hari! Shinde! Take him to hospital. She is alive. I came ten minutes earlier, sir. And when I came.. - Where is Anurag? - Sir has already gone. You take her to the hospital. Dr. Chopra. His number is written in a dairy kept in that drawer. Uma knew about Shalini and Anurag, Nilesh. Patil. Dixit here. Yes. Intercept Anurag Dixit's car. Lay a curfew. All exit points to be sealed. What is this? What's going on? - Why am I stopped? Why are they.. - Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Uma is at the hospital. Why? What's wrong with her? Don't try to pretend, Anurag. - What do you mean? - Arrest him! - Hey? But what has happened? - Arrest him I say! - But why? - Shut up! - Stop! - Come on, take him. - But what have I done? - Shut up! Get in. You will have to tell me what I've done, Brother. I say go and sit in the van. - But why? - Go! Because your car has been identified. Go in, I said. Anurag, I don't want to listen to anything. Mr. Goel, I want to see Hari's room once again. Uma, what happened? Did Anurag.. No.Anurag is innocent. - I had extra pills by mistake. - Why, Uma? Why? The night before the murder.. Was Anurag at home? - Yes. Did you ever go to meet Shalini? Yes. Once or twice. To buy the paintings. Why did you come to the court? Because I was concerned about Anurag. Tell me something, Uma. Did you know about Anurag and Shalini? Yes. After her death. Take care, Uma. I know which difficulties you are undergoing, Kevin. But that's over now. Nothing is over yet. Our Mumbai news-reporter Shishir Joshi has just reported.. Our Mumbai news-reporter Shishir Joshi has just reported.. ...that the police have arrested the pilot.. ...which they were hunting for the Shalini murder case. This pilot is Anurag Dixit, the younger brother of.. ...the police commissioner of Mumbai. After this breaking news, it is possible that now.. ...the major suspicion will be shifted from.. ...the main suspect Kevin Toraso to Anurag Dixit. Kevin Toraso was released on bail. Please pay attention, Anurag Dixit's wife.. ...is admitted to the ICU ward of City Care hospital. So, the police are unable to take any statement from her yet. And Anurag Dixit too has not given any statement yet. The sources have informed that.. ...Commissioner Dixit already knew about it. I love you, Kevin. We tried to ask him, but he refusedt o speak to us. We'll be back again with the news related to this case. Hello? Yes? Yes. Okay. Yes. Okay. Bye. Sir, thereis a fax for you. Dixit, what is the date on the day wecame.. ...to know about that fake Roy painting? Fine. Okay. Thank you. Hail Lord Ganesh! Hail Lord Ganesh! Hello. Her Majesty, Ms. Rudra Bhargav.. ...wishes you a very good evening. She is not in a mood to have a drink right now.. ...so she shall join us in a cool fizz. Hi, sweetheart. How are you? To which school do you go to? She is addicted to this junk, here you are. She can't talk. Please come. Here we are, Your Majesty. Your chocolate.. Chocolate. I've never seen such a wheel chair. I have personally designed it. How did it happen? It was a car accident. My wife, you can see her photograph. She was killed, my in-laws were killed, Rudra was paralysed. And I managed to escape with just a broken arm. That's why you stopped practicing? What option did I have? Who would have taken care of her? Her studies. Schooling. But that was not the only reason. So? - I loved being a detective in my childhood. I was the monitor of my class. So, when the interclass plays were held.. ...I would always choose detective stories. And I would play the detective's role. But when I went up to the stage for the first time.. ...I became so nervous that I accused the wrong person. My father almost disowned me for that. - Kevin, some whiskey. - Yes. Thank you. - Water? - Yes. - Rati, a drink for you? - No, thanks. - Some juice? - Yeah, sure. Okay. Orange juice. Coming up. Blue oranges? This is Rudra's favourite book. It says that if we believe in something, it happens. If we want to do something whole heartedly, we do it. Ultimately what? Twe want to see, what wet hink happens. So, Rudra and I are convinced that she will.. ...definitely walk on her legs some day. Of course, you will. Why have you called me here? To play the game of detective. Mahadev is just not a cook, he is a chef, you know. What's wrong, Kevin? Didn't you like the food? Oh! It was great. But you didn't tell me yet, sir, why have you called me? If you remember, Kevin, you were implicated.. ...in the case of a fake painting two years ago? My innocence was proved. Yes, I know that. But I also know that you did it. You escaped because technically you were.. ...not present where you should have been. Because you had a strong alibi. Mohammed Kasim in Delhi. He said in the court that you were in Delhi and not in Mumbai. There was a railway strike that day. And every passenger travelling by flight was scanned. So? - So? So, I want to say that day you were.. ...notin Delhi but Mumbai, Kevin. And you reached Mumbai very fast. Not by train, not by plane but byroad. You said you worked for some Truzor company at Delhi.. A clearing and forwarding company. Am I right? Theday that painting was delivered in Mumbai.. ...Truzor company of Delhi had made one more delivery. Mr. Sunil Mahra had made the delivery. The item of the delivery was ared Mercedes. You knew, Kevin. You knew that Aditya has a red Mercedes. Neither did I know Aditanor his father. Someone else had taken that delivery. Because you had a strong alibi. Right? Mohammed Kasim. And Mohammed Kasim was the owner.. ...of the Truzor company, Kevin. Shalini had a painting of Krishna and Sita. Does it mean anything to you? No. Did you know Aditya, Kevin? Did you know Adita or not? What's wrong with you, Rati? I didn't know him. Then what's the mystery of your car and Kasim? I want to know! I want to know! I was here. I was in Mumbai. I was involved in that racket. But I didn't know that Shalini is here in Mumbai. I don't even remember that the car belonged to Sunil Mehra. I don't even remember that Shalini was in Mumbai. Oh, no! I can't kill, Rati. I can't ditch Shalini. 'Washing my sins off.' 'You loved to drive, didn't you?' 'There is no joy of driving in Mumbai.' 'You are stuck in traffic for hours.' 'l lied to you.' 'l always wash my sins off when I lie.' 'l always wash my sins off when I lie.' - "'Shalini, slow down. Slow down. - Kevin, it's no use to stop me now." - 'No! Slow down. - Kevin, don't be boring.' - 'Slow down. - Wow! What fun!' 'There's no joy in driving in Mumbai.' 'You are stuck in traffic for hours.' - Yes, Kevin? - Why did Anurag kill Shalini? Anurag didn't kill anyone. That photograph is of Delhi, right? Right. My wife and my in-laws were from Delhi. When did this accident take place? Four years ago. Shalini was also in Delhi four years ago. She always washed her sins off when she lied. And that night she lied to me. Who was driving the other car? Who was driving the other car, Nilesh? - Shalini Chauhan. Very smart, Kevin. It was just an accident. Just an accident! Just an accident? You call it an accident? That accident killed my wife. She was pregnant. And she died. My child also along with her. Do you see Rudra? Do you see her condition? She can't talk at all. She is restricted from the bed to the wheelchair. That's it. Day in and day out. You don't have any dear one who is handicapped.. ...with whom you have to spend your life. That's why you won't realise it. Yes. Alas, if only you had some dear one. They had suppressed this case. Just swept it under the carpet. Brake fail? Brake fail, my foot! She was drunk. She was irritated. They were wealthy. They had a contact with the higher authorities. Someone took the blame upon himself for money. That's it. Finished. The case was closed. And I was unable to do anything. I was helpless. Barrister Nilesh Bhargav was made to look like a fool. And you call it an accident? An accident? It was not an accident, it was a crime. A murder. What is the real reason of calling me that time, Nilesh? To introduce you to Rudra. How did Shalini get her firsti njury? Didn't you hear the sound of the breaking of glass? - No. - Never mind, it happens. 'Enough, Shalini.' Why were you inquiring about Shalini's painting? Shalini's father's namewas Janakraj Chauhan. Think. Think, Kevin. Think. She had to be for it, Kevin. She had to be for it. Hari's death was not just a mere accident. 'Hello! Excuse me.' 'Hi. I've never seen you here before.' 'There is a strange feeling in my stomach. - Excuse me.' 'It seems I'm hungry or I am in love.' 'And the only way I can find out is by taking you out for dinner.' 'Are those your lines?' 'No. Actually from some film.' 'You must be feeling very happy.. ...to seeme in this condition, don't you?' 'An alcoholic. No life.' - Mahadev. - Yes, sir? - Send this to the commissioner. - Okay. And send this other one to that boy Kevin. Kevin Toraso. - Kevin? - Yes. 'Papa?' 'Oh my God.' 'Rudra?' 'Call Kevin. - Please calm down.' - 'Call Kevin. Okay, we'll call him. We'll call him.' 'Where is Kevin? - Doctor, you will have to do something.' 'Doctor, don't worry about money.' 'She is bleeding profusely.' 'What are you doing? It's paining badly.' 'Yes, dear. I am here. I am here.' 'Doctor, please do something.' 'I can't do anything, Mr. Chauhan.' 'Her alcohol level is very high. It is a police case.' - 'Call Kevin. - Yes. Yes, dear.' 'Call Kevin! - Yes, I'll call him. 'Doctor, you will have to do something.' 'Don't worry about money at all. Savemy daughter..' 'It is not the matter ofmoney, Mr. Chauhan.' 'Look at the game of destiny, Dixit.' 'You had to come to me for this case in this entire Mumbai.' 'The system before which I had found myself..' '..so weak and helpless four years ago.. '..Today it has come to me to become the puppet of my hands.' 'Police. Law. Criminal. Evidence.' 'Perhaps I can't express this feeling in words.' 'It was a sensational game for me.' 'l could change its rules as I liked.' 'l could control anything.' 'l could convict anyone.' 'l could acquit anyone.' 'l was the criminal. I was the judge.' 'l felt like the Almighty.' 'But this was a chance for me as well.' 'To know that person more personally whom I've killed.' 'You know and God is the witness.. ...that I didn't know Anurag.' 'At that time, I could see only one face..' '..in the passion of hatred and revenge.' 'Shalini.' 'l was so confident of my plan.' 'I didn't know that Kevin will also get involved in this case.' 'All the evidences were against him.' 'To prove Kevin and Anurag innocent..' '..it became more important for meto get involved in this case.' 'As for that pilot, I had purposely chosen a Friday..' '..with the hope that the pilot must have some alibi.' 'But unfortunately, Anurag didn't have any fool proof alibi.' 'My opinion regarding this case completely changed with these two.' 'Now my intention was to prove them innocent.' 'More characters were involved during this period.' 'Hari's reality, Aditya's lie.' 'This case became more interesting for me with them.' 'They raised so many questions for me..' '..that I was unable to control myself.. ...from finding answers to them.' 'It was more than just a game for me now.' 'l got involved in my investigation with them.' 'The thrills of unanswered questions..' '..momentarily took me away from my main objective.' 'During this, one more accident..' '..changed the direction of this case.' 'Hari's death.' 'Perhaps, Mr. Goel has paid the biggest price in this case.' 'He has lost his son.' 'There is a cheque for him in this envelop.' 'l know this amount can never compensate him for his loss..' '..but right now, I can't do anything for him except this.' 'Dixit, please tell him to change the lock of his house.' 'That lock is the root cause of all the problems.' 'l still don't trust that Aditya.' 'l'm sure that he was standing out of Shalini's house that night.' 'It doesn't seem strange to me now that the circle of life..' '..is always completed.' 'The very theory with which I would convince..' '..so many people during my days of practice.. '..Was finally applicable to me too.' 'A criminal always returns to the scene of crime.' Kevin, why did Nilesh mention about that painting? Shalini's father's name was Janakraj Chauhan. - So? The name of Sita's father in Ramayan was Janak too. Shalini was fearful. Sita was going to her mother. To her motherland. Shalini had the fear of death. Since she had spotted Nilesh in Mumbai.. ...she could see death in her eyes. She had started begging for pity. And Lord Krishna? Lord Krishna has many names. Nilesh is one of them. You needn't have done this, Nilesh. No one would have come to know. - How is Rudra? - Good. She is happy. Kevin has returned to Goa again. He had a meeting with some alternative therapist.. ...who is doing Rudra's treatment now. - Kevin thinks she will walk again. - Oh, that's wonderful. Can I do anything for you? There are some cases which needs a good lawyer. So.. - All right, Nilesh. - Thank you. You are always welcome. 'Shalini?' 'Shalini, what happened?' 'Aditya, didn't you leave yet?' - 'Shalini, blood? - It's nothing.' 'You have gotan injury, Shalini.' 'No. I slipped and the glass pierced me.' 'Nonsense! That Kevin has done this, right?' 'Kevin has done this to you.' 'That's it! I'm going to kill him.' 'I'll kill him for what he has done to you.- What?' 'l will kill that idiot!' 'Go away from here.' 'How did you dare to say this?' 'l will kill you. Go away from here.' 'Getlost! Never comehere again. I will kill you.' 'Seek not miracles in the world, as they only exist within oneself.' 'For the divine miracles are manifested..' '..every second of our lives.' 'In each bud blooming into a flower.' 'In the first steps of a child.' 'In the sun rising every morning.' 'In nursing an ailing person back to health.' 'In drawing unrestrained love to the lost heart.' 'Miracles are like blue oranges.' 'They exist onlyin the realms of one's mind.' "Where is the heart searching for signs of happiness?" "The entire world dwells within you." "if you look through your heart.." "..the happiness is there where you are." "The signs of happiness." "How did that innocent smile bloom?" "Where did the flowers get its colour from?" "Have you ever stopped for a moment to ponder?" "All such miracles dwell within you too." "The heaven resides wherever you see." "Where is the heart searching for signs of happiness?" "Where is the heart searching for signs of happiness?" "If you look through your heart.." "..the happiness is there where you are."
