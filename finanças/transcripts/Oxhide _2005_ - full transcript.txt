Dedicated to my parents Were you scared? No? Sure you were! What? Want to go to the toilet again? I go to the toilet, so what? So what? - Come on, Mum. - You ain't better! Look! This door can't even close! What kind of life is this? You think people forgot about that already? You think you can hide? No one will forgive you. Beibei. How come I can't see Mao Dou? She's always hiding in my room. She was also scared to death. I'm thinking about this character, Put it vertically. This one? It looks better that way. Not that easy. Sure it's easy. Listen. Beibei. Type a character. Skip a line. On and on, so it looks vertical. It won't work. - Is that all right? - OK. This one is too small. Make it bigger. Which one? The one you've just typed. Use the biggest size directly. - Is this the biggest? - No. Use a bigger one then. It won't fit in a page. Make it smaller then. OK, this is fine. Now. Shorten a little the space between the characters. More. Come on. Make it shorter. Is that OK? Is that it? But. Here. Isn't it too small now? - No. - No? OK, then. Down there. Don't put them vertical. Change them to horizontal. These two? Yes. Those two at the end. Write them horizontally. Here. Write it like the previous line. Change it to Song style. Is this Song style? That's too small. Make it bigger. - Which one? - The one you've just typed! How am I supposed to guess? Take it easy! - This one here? - Yes. This one. - Smaller or bigger? - Bigger! Just a little bit. The vertical ones up there, Change them to Kai style. Is this Kai style? Doesn't look good. Just leave it for now. The small line down here, Change it to Kai style. We'll come back to it later. Let's change this character above back to Song style. - Is this Song style? - Yes. Too thin, make it bold. See if it's better. We're almost done. Type it all and show it to me. The layout is fine. The space between the two parts, between the vertical and horizontal characters should be a little smaller. OK like this? Smaller. OK. Let me have another look. Almost finished. All this part... Listen, and don't get mad. All this part should be moved down a little bit. Too much, stop! Go back up a little. Let me see. OK. That's it this time. How many should I print? Let me see. We have eight shelves. If I put one copy between two shelves, that's four. Four plus one. Five. Five plus an extra one. Six. I want six. I print one first. Take a look. Forget it. Forget it. Just print the six. - Don't you want to see? - No. Not too much. - That's enough. - It's not much. It's hot. I need more. Get me some rice. Today someone told me the woman selling newspapers died. - Which one? - The one looking like a lion. Oh! That one again? No way. I saw her just yesterday morning. Sure. She passed away last night. What happened? I don't know the details. They said she felt a violent pain in her chest last night. She asked for sugar water. Her daughter made her some. But. By the time she came back, her mum was gone. How old was she? Just forty something. She looked older, didn't she? Yes. She really did. Poor girl. Working so hard and what for? - Absolutely. - I agree. Her whole family lived on her income. She had her own special way to sell newspapers. She shouted so loud: "Evening news! Evening news!" She ran so fast. Even those who ran downstairs after her couldn't catch up with her to buy their newspapers! To the other building. Then came a very smart guy. He loaded his bike with newspapers. Just followed her, said nothing and sold them all. She was so silly. Right? Drink milk. I will. - What is it? - I want some pancakes. It's cold now. Doesn't matter. Drink now. The meal is over and you haven't drunk. You should drink your milk together with your meal. It's better for digestion. Take some tissue. Clean yourself. How come you can't just swallow it? Beibei. I don't know what to say. Clean your mouth. Don't drink it. Listen to me. Calm down. Here. Take this. No matter what. Hold on! You have to finish your milk, or you won't get taller. I won't get any taller anyway! Don't say that! Ma Xiaolin kept getting taller even in university! When she entered university she looked short and thin. After she graduated, she grew incredibly tall. Am I right? How do you know all this? You said that a dozen times. Tell me then. Why did she get so tall? Why? - I don't know! - She drank milk! You keep saying: "It's too late! Too late!" But I told you. It works! It's not too late! Look at me. I drink milk everyday! This way, I will keep growing up. Do you believe it? Stop laughing. I will for sure! You believe it or not? No. I'm short because of you! Luckily, I didn't grow like you! A big body with short legs! With legs no longer than fingers! You think that's funny? Don't get mad. It's a joke. How dare you behave like this? Milk is important. You should care about it. You should show some respect. If you're like this. No matter how much you drink, you won't grow more! The meal is over. Take a look at this. It's higher on the left. - OK now? - OK. - Is it stable? - Yes. No problem. Just try. - How is it? - Not bad. Just pull it as much as you can. Very effective. No way. - Why is that? - It hurts. I can swing like this. Beibei. There's something wrong. It can be pulled, but does it work only for the upper part of the body? Come here. You don't carry it properly. Now it's straight. - Is that OK now? - Not yet. Still too long. Let me shorten it. This bag is too ugly. Your dad designed this bag so that the different layers are different in size. One big, One small. Just like a pyramid. Also, the colours are different. All right now? Put your arms naturally. Like this. Not bad. Try this one. Let me see. This side. It's not that good. Turn it over. No, It looks better on that side. - This side? - Yes. Not on the shoulder. Take it with your hand. It touches the ground. Hold it around your arm. This is fine. Walk around. - How is it? - Just walk. Do you like this one? The colour is too dark. I think. Too murky. I prefer the other one. This bag requires more work than the other. It took a few days to put it together piece by piece. Come on. Try this one. This looks very nice. You know what? This is horsehair. Remember, You have to stroke it the right way. Like this. - Downwards? - Yes. That's it. Even on the sides. You have to stroke downwards. Take it now. Doesn't look good. - Try with your hand. - Like this? You look strange with it. Let your mum try it. No matter how you carry it, it doesn't look nice. When women carry this bag. They walk this way, They hold it and put their hands on their bellies. You shouldn't walk stiffly In big steps. You should do like this: Waddle along, wiggle your hips. See? Mum is good. 1, 2, 3, 4 5, 6, 7, 8... 2, 2, 3, 4... Good, you can stop now. We still have a big one here. Let me try it. This one is good. I like this one. I keep this bag for myself. Don't do that. It's a nice one. If it was for sale, how much? We shouldn't keep it. If I use it, it must be for a reason... Can't you figure out what's inside? Business was bad for days. Now our luck has changed. - Keep looking. - Is there more? That's great! Why so much today? I sold quite a lot today to many old customers. The 50% discount! Don't say that. Do you know what they said? They said our bags looked good because of our ideas. Idea! No matter how you say idea, look what we've got! - Great! - It's a good day! A French woman came. French? How can you tell? I don't for sure. I just guessed by the way she looked. She said our bag was her dream bag. - How pathetic! - How stupid! Her dream bag! I don't find it stupid. I think she meant it. See how fat your dad is. However. He's very agile. - Very nimble. - More than I am. - I almost lost my pants. - Yes, quite! Long time ago. He could dance to The five Inch Knife. What's that? - The Red Detachment of Woman? Yes. Tell me about it. For The Five Inch Knife, the main thing is two hands. A knife in each one. Drawing an eight in the air. The right one draws a clockwise eight. I learnt this. The left one draws an eight counter clockwise. It's difficult. I guess you couldn't do it! Stand properly. Look at my right hand. You see? - Slow down. - OK. Right hand side. A clockwise eight. See? Left hand side. A counter clockwise eight. Clockwise eight. Now. The two hands together. They must be coordinated. Quite difficult? How's Mao Dou? Same old problem. Restless again. It's the sight of money. You care for nothing but money. Don't you? My little kitty. I'll show you: Clockwise eight, counter clockwise eight. Like this. Go on. No room here to move freely. There's something I forgot. Today Xiao Li called you. I asked her why, she wouldn't say, And then I guessed. Isn't it about time we give her back her money? Beibei. Come here. Stop! Go back. OK. Come here again. What is it? Nothing. Go back again. OK. Come here. What's wrong? Is one of my legs longer? No. Guess what? You've grown up! See. It's possible! You've grown up. Let's measure, shall we? Come on. Let's do it. Take off your shoes. The floor's dirty. Get a ruler. This won't do. Other people use this. I don't care. I don't like to use this. Get the set square. - What? - A triangular ruler. What a pain! I'm the one measuring you! No set square. Take a book then. Not this one. Too thin. Get a thicker one. Look at you! - Is this OK? - Yes. What are you thinking! Shoes! Stand still. Not like this. Don't be so stiff. Stand normally. Is this the highest point? A little bit to the left... - Your left or mine? - Mine. I can't do it here. Move to the right. Not so much! All right here? Is it the highest point? Wait. Now move. Slowly. Come back here. Good. Move this way. A bit more. Stand normally. Is this the highest point? Yes. Are you sure? Slightly to the right. Slightly to the right... OK. OK. Slowly. Slowly. I'm going now. Now, what did I say? - I'm taller? - Take a pen. I must have grown 1 cm. Even 1 mm is enough! Can I go now? Not yet. Make a phone call. What for? Tell your mum the good news! E20 is finished. That is the 143. Put the tape on. I will take it when I come back. Why did you leave so early? I must do overtime for you! Remember the 50% discount? Why are you in such a bad mood today? I would have said nothing but you asked for it! The old gatekeeper. He is so mean! He's working on the night shift everyday. He locked the bathroom today. I couldn't go to the toilets! I couldn't take out the rubbish! Because we leave later, now the garbage has become a problem. He was so angry today! He took several black garbage bags. Big and torn. Gave them to me. I couldn't say no. He told me to collect the rubbish and dump it elsewhere tomorrow. He made me so mad: He said it was for my own good! It's for his own convenience! Bullshit! My own good! Yeah right! Why get so upset? It's just garbage. If not today we'll dump it tomorrow. - Why do you take sides with him? - You think so? That's just rubbish bags. He took them for you, but he didn't ask for money. Why did you hit me? I just hit you. Why did you do that? Tell me why! No way to wipe it off. See, it's the scar of a whip. Look here, so many scars. Yes. I see. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Only here, there are about twenty already. - Stop it! - So many lashes. Pull it that way. No. Here. No good either. This leather is ruined. The scars of whips are hidden. Do you see this brand? What are we going to do with it? We can't use it. This ox hide is ruined. Are these Mao Dou's scratches? Yes. She's got to pass the time somehow. She likes to play with it. The biggest problem is the mark. It's in a very awkward spot. We got used to seeing all these brands, but this one's different, from those we usually see. Do you think this was stamped on the leather? No. It was branded on the cow. Right? When the cow was alive. The owner does this just because he wants to mark his own cows. What is it that they use? A stamp? When it's made white hot, it's branded on the cow. No, definitely not. This was not a stamp. Where we spread out the leather, four or five pieces, each of them sometimes has the same letter on it. Only the size, shape and depth are different. Sometimes the mark is branded with more strength. Just look at this one. You can almost take it out! Imagine how much pain it went through. I see. So you think that was not a stamp. I know, so they used a branding iron to write directly on the butt of the cow. That's it. - Very painful. - Extremely painful. This scar has not been made with a whip. No matter what, the cow is slaughtered in the end. Then it's skin is ripped off and the leather ends up in our hands. Then we use it to make bags painstakingly. We put the bags in our shops. Then we sell them cut-price. That's true. Selling them at such a cheap price makes me feel sorry for the cow. Forget it. I clean inside. You clean outside. Take the chair. - Go get me a basin after. And some water. Put it here. This alkaline water burns my hands a little. From where? Start from the third pane. Try first. - It's really dirty! - 1, 2... - Here? - Yes. See my hand? Filthy dirty. Yeah, all dirt. It's blown here by the wind. This pane is not too bad. Just clean the lower part. Let's clean the fourth one after this. The cloth is very dirty! It's all black now. Can you reach up here? Clean a little bit. - Here inside? - No, here. OK. We should clean this face to face. A little higher. It'd be nice to clean inside the circles. I'll clean the bottom first. What is this? Why did you bring this back? I decided, no more discount. Why? It's been there too long already. Look outside, it's spring. I can see something's wrong. What happened? This customer today, even though there was 50% off already, guess what she said. "50% off?" "Well, with another 50% off, that'd be a fair price." What does that mean? Another 50% off? She was just nasty! Another one seemed to like our 131. You know, the hat. Perfect colour, size and leather. Cheap price. With the discount. I thought he'd buy it for sure. But finally he put the hat back on the shelf and said: "Keep it for me, when it gets cold. I'll come back." Does he really think the discount will last forever? Or that he'll always get one? Don't get mad for this. People want a discount. I'm fed up with all this. When a customer comes in, he doesn't look around, he just wants the discount! People just want cheap prices. Cheap! Cheap! I don't mind. I can even lower prices. Do you know what matters to me? I just want customers to pay my price. No more bargaining with me, please! It's our shop, our bags, and eventually. Customers set their prices! Put this away! Stop getting angry like this! We might need them again for another discount. If need be. Listen, I really don't care. Let's hang on to the price we've set. No more discount. We can still sell without discount. Our leather is of good quality, right? Right? We designed our bags ourselves, right? We made them ourselves, right? Painstakingly. We worked so hard! That's good stuff we're selling, and we sell them cut-price! If it's the sales season, customers will bargain prices just without any reason. We might as well let them slap me in the face! What about my dignity? All right then, keep your dignity and wait for death! Why the sesame paste? Your dad likes it. Should I put the noodles in the water? Yes, but check that the water isn't too cold. Put it here. Oh, I forgot. I'll go wash the cucumbers. You continue with this. I'll go wash the cucumbers. Why put sesame paste in my noodles? You like it. Don't you? You can't put it that way! It's my fault. I didn't tell her how to do. - I wasn't there. - How should I do? Take another bowl. Get some salt. But she ate this before! It was ready-made. It doesn't matter. I didn't know. Doesn't matter. Noodles are in the bowl. Forget it. OK, now. How can you lick this? It's dirty! But it's good! It's real sesame paste! When we were young, We couldn't buy much. - One jar per person, that is... Yes. That's it. 50 g. Get it? I remember it all. I took a small bowl to buy some from the state-owned grocery store in the hutong. I bought 50 g. How much is that? Very little. Just a tiny bit. Here. Actually, even less than this. On the way back home, I felt like eating it! And then I licked a little bit of it. See? - There's a mark! - Yes! I was afraid if my parents saw that, they would beat me up. So I would shake it hard. And the mark would disappear. How do you know? I used to do the same! Our family lived close to the store. Whenever I bought sesame paste, I would lick the paste quickly and then shake the bowl till the mark was gone. I was scared grandma would see. Beibei. Give me some water. Have some sesame paste too. Maybe later. Actually. I don't like it so much. I like sesame paste, but not mixed with noodles. Too bland. Don't move, there's something on your lips. Here. Water. That's too much. Listen Beibei. I'll teach you. Sesame paste is thick. So it should be mixed with water. Not too much. Add it little by little. I put too much. What happens then? The paste doesn't blend with it properly. Sesame paste stays in the bottom and water on top. It won't blend. That's right. Put the water little by little. Now it's still thick. Let me try. Not like this! Clockwise! Like this? Always clockwise. It's so sticky! You're too slow! I'll do it. Let your dad do it. See? See the way I do it? Just do like me! - Clockwise. - Like this? Clockwise. Add some water. - Don't go too fast! - A little bit. - Like this? - That's right. Clockwise. You'd better let me do it. You'll eat it when it's ready. See? Almost done. Add some water. - A little? - Yes. It'll be done very soon. Some more water. Almost ready. - A little? - OK. Good. - More water? - Enough. I think it tastes even better with chilly sauce. OK, I'll go prepare some. - Don't bother. - Not at all. It's quick! You put oil in the noodles. Must be so oily! Not at all. You think chilly sauce is oil? This means you don't know a thing about it. Chilly sauce is soy sauce. Although it's not true to say there's no oil in it. You heat a little oil in a wok. Then you put some chilly into it, and then you fry the chilly till it becomes dark. When it's done... Oh yes, get a bowl and some soy sauce. Otherwise it will be too late. Don't forget to take a spoon. But don't put it in the bowl. It's been spoiled. A small spoon will do. Enough? Let the spoon here. Enough. The sauce inside the bowl is cold. When your mum brings the oil with the fried chilly, you'll hear a hiss! That's it. No need to talk about it, you'll see. I'll try some of yours later. Your mum doesn't like it. She thinks it's too bland. Here it comes! It's hot. Don't get burnt. Make room, slowly. Beibei, you listen! Not that great. The oil is just not hot enough. It was not heated enough. Smells good? Very good! Put the spoon inside. Dad can make crunchy candy with sesame paste. What is this? Crunchy candy is made with sesame paste. Let me tell you. It's very oily! Hot? I'll tell you about crunchy candy. When I was a child, I used to be constipated easily. So your grandpa would take a small basin. I still remember it was a bit blue and green and made of thin glass. He mixed sesame paste with a lot of white granulated sugar. - No water? - No water. But he took a chopstick to stir it into a lump. He would divide it into small pieces and eat piece by piece. Does it work? Sure and it's good! When you eat that candy, you can taste the sugar. It's very good. Have you tried that before? When you were young. No, when I was pregnant, I couldn't take medicine. During that time, your mum suffered a lot. She was constipated. So your dad made crunchy candy for me. Delicious. Eat, stop talking. My noodles are too salty. I'll have less. I'll have a little of this first. And then some of that. See my mixture. A masterpiece! Eat garlic. Put some chilly sauce. Mine is too salty already. I'll put some next time. It's salty enough as it is. You have to put some chilly sauce. Otherwise it'll be a waste. Listen to that kid! This is even saltier. I'll have some later. Let me try. So, is that it? The sesame paste is a mess. Doesn't taste good. Just too salty, that's all. Too much salt. Have some more noodles. There's still a lot. Take some more. You go first. It won't be as salty. Let me taste your paste... with garlic. - What's the matter with you? Me? What now? You want to imitate me? - She imitated me! I heard! - I did not. What's wrong with you? Why do you imitate him like that? You're not any better! Why can't you eat properly? You see? If you can't finish the whole cucumber, Why do you break it into pieces? So what? Why don't you go eat with her, then? Did you look under the bed? Behind the cabinet, everywhere? Look carefully. Did you check the balcony? I'm sure she's not there! How can you be so sure? Definitely not. Impossible. What's all this mess around here? Do you have the mirror? What for? Go on, get it. Not here. Nothing. Where are you? Put the mirror back. Where have you been, Pussycat? My little kitty! Should I really cut her claws today? You're home today anyway, aren't you? Too stretched! No, far from it. Let me help you. Give me one end. Try harder. It's tight. Pull hard. Hold it properly. - Like this? - Yes. - You're OK? - Yes, I'm fine. How come dad's belly is so big? I wonder too. I don't know when it got so big. I really can't remember. Sometimes when I look at it, I'm scared. It doesn't work that way. Hang it somewhere. OK, let's try here. With this drawer? Yes, here. No. Too loose. Next one. - Is that OK here? - Nearly. Here is fine. Like this. What do you think? Good. Here comes dad. Coming! You bought mutton kebabs? Take a plate. Take the small bag. Plate. Eat. Give it to me. Come on, eat, quick. Why don't you eat? I've already eaten there. I had three tendon kebabs. - Mum, it's fat. - Give it to me. So many people, today I had to queue. I got rid of the fat. This one too. Guess how many he sells a day. Five hundred. That's a lot! I would have guessed three hundred. How many exactly? That guy told me, last night before eleven... You hear me? It wasn't even 11 and he had already sold 1000 kebabs. Really? Why would he lie to me? If he said 1000, it must be 1200 or 1300. How much profit on each one? Those people make at least 50% profit. If this is the case, let's say the profit on one kebab is 25 cents. Eat. One kebab brings in 0.25 yuan. Ten kebabs... 2.50. 100 kebabs. 25 yuan 1000 kebabs. 250 yuan. You made a mistake. The calculator? In the lowest drawer, under the trousers. 0.25 yuan. 0.25. 0.25... Mao Dou! Leave her alone. Times 1000... You were right. This business is better. And he also makes money selling kebabs at 1 yuan or 2. With 300 yuan per day, one month brings in 9000 yuan. He's alone, isn't he? What he does during the day is buy mutton and string the pieces together. When it's dark, he starts to make them roast. But as for our shop, selling nothing day after day became a routine. It's easy to earn money. No need to use one's brain. Listen, you two! You should no longer help them by buying mutton kebabs! You! Stop eating now! What time is it? Almost eight. Haven't got any news yet. What news? You can't think properly. Go out and have a look. There are discounts in each and every shop! You're too childish! What can you sell without a discount? When you go shopping, don't you look for a discount? You always think that with a fair price, you don't cheat on them. But customers don't think that way. If you give a discount, they'll come. Even though you raise the prices before the discount, it still works and you can sell. You never believed this! But, don't you remember that day when lots of old customers came for the discount? The shop was busy and business was very good! What about now? Will they come back if you don't give them a discount? Isn't this taking advantage of us? Remember the customer who said your bag was her dream bag? Without a discount, She won't dream anymore! You think she'll come back? Are you angry now? If you want to do that job, you should be like an actor. You should consider the situation objectively. How can you earn money otherwise? Think about it seriously, step by step. Don't think it's you doing the sale, but someone else. Then, think objectively about the way you were before... when you only cared about face and dignity! We have to pay the rent on the 14th and we have to pay the wages on the 18th. Look at your life these days. Think about what happened to you. How can you live like this? I know. Stop slapping yourself! That's enough now! You have to put an end to all this! I know. Now... people... are all crawling on the floor. All of them, everywhere... But I am standing. I'm the only one willing to stand. That way, I'm an easy prey. Stand still. Get closer to me. How is it? Not getting any taller yet. It's not my fault. It's useless to say that. I just care about the results. You can't measure her all the time. One can't grow up everyday. You don't understand. She's not getting taller. She's getting shorter. This kid really disappoints me. Don't blame your child. It's not her fault if you can't sell anything! I'm so unfortunate! Don't talk about that anymore. Take your medicine first. Take it. Don't swallow it so quickly! Stupid! The water is still very hot! Wait. I'll get some cold water. Beibei. Get me a stone for a foot massage. What are you looking at? Don't watch. Stop looking at me. - What are you doing? - Bathing my feet. That's legal, isn't it? Right. Don't take mine! Take one for yourself. - It's boiling. - There is cold water. Is that OK? Yes. It's comfortable. You should often do that. Didn't you say... your feet and hands are cold all the time? Yes. I guess... your blood pressure is too low. That's why. - Does foot bathing help? - It should. The key is to use hot water. - Mum. - Yes. Tomorrow is dad's birthday. The lunar calendar says nothing will work out. Do you believe in this? It doesn't make any sense. One day, I checked the calendar. The day was good for hunting, but not for going out. How can you hunt if you don't go out? Kill somebody at home! Well, I have to tell you something. What? Don't talk to your dad about his birthday when he comes back. Why not? It's the same thing every year. I know... that he wishes he could sell more on his birthday. The more you expect, the less you get. If nothing is sold by the afternoon, he'll get mad and kill someone. No matter what, this is an important year for daddy. We should go out to have hotpot. You can be a good daughter... without having to go anywhere. Just eat at home. Let your dad really enjoy a meal. No matter what he says, don't make him lose face. If you can do this, I would be thankful to you. It's not that easy. It's not only about arguing. When he eats, he makes noises with his tongue: When he eats spicy food, he goes "slurp". When he eats hot food, he goes "slurp". When he eats cold food, he goes "slurp" too! This is one thing. On top of that, he puts lots of food inside his mouth, and then, he doesn't chew or swallow. He speaks. He says nothing when his mouth is empty. He only speaks when his mouth is full. And he has to struggle to keep the food from spilling out. Who can bear this? Don't talk that way! Several years ago, when dad had money, I bet you would not have dared to. You think I am that kind of person? I think so, indeed! Beibei. Not asleep yet? No. - Want some water? - I'm not thirsty. I think you dress... too casually. Since you're small, shouldn't you wear more delicate clothes? What do you mean by "delicate"? Like the Japanese. I dress just like a Japanese. You are a Japanese Ronin! What is a Ronin? Don't you know what you're talking about? I said it unconsciously. It's a warrior, you know? Every warrior has his own master. After his master is dead, he's left alone. So, he has to find to survive by himself. Such a warrior is called a Ronin. He's a solitary warrior. How odd! My dad hasn't fallen asleep! The whole family is like that. Your grandma, while asleep, can suddenly speak one sentence, which makes perfect sense. It's heredity. Now I can't remember... how it was when we were not in debt. Huifen? Huifen? I'm telling you... this year... no matter what, we should clear all our debts. Yeah, right! You say that every year. Are you laughing at me? Once everything becomes better, I think... we should never forget the suffering... we're going through now. Even if I wanted to forget, we're still suffering for now. Anyway, I don't think I'm old. I'm still young. I have a lot of things I haven't accomplished yet. Huifen? Huifen? Huifen? Beibei? Beibei? Subtitling processed by C.M.C. - Paris
