ARE WE? Out! - Do you like it? - Great! ARE WE? ARE WE? The smallest district of Buenos Aires it dictates fashions and customs. In just three blocks (and an apple* was enough for Adam and Eve to fall) *apple=manzana=block they are, like in the apple of original sin, life and death: RECOLETA. Life in one side, death on the other. In this opposition is the rebellion against the conventionalisms. Individual liberty. Here in Recoleta, Buenos Aires. Now. Too far from downtown, I will lose time. You've been growling since the farm, three hundred km growling. What are you? The Yeti? I'm not for jokes, come on. The reservation is made, Dr. Lecube. A single and a suite. A matter of ... the lady. Yes, a suite and a single. The suite, with a huge bed, very huge... large, very large. For two. The other with a single bed alone, for the boy. All right, lady, all in order. Lady? Call me Miss... You're a hussy. Why in this hotel? Why in this place? You forget, we're two steps away from the place where you met me... ... five, six ... six months ago. You don't remember? - I was on the table with ... - I remember. And what's up with that? That after all that time in the farm with you I am entitled to a holiday with my old friends. La Recoleta, expensive It is my world. Here you chose me. Marcelo, do you like your room? Yeah, yeah. It's okay, dad, I like it. The whim of Celia. We could be closer to downtown. By the way, do you like Celia? Yes, of course I like her. More than the others? Anyway, I don't know why I ask. It's my own business. I forgot... this is for you, it won't do you wrong. Crazy. - Do you still like me? - More... increasingly. I must be crazy to stay so far from my office. It's my place. In this area I was born and I spent my adolescence. I'm meeting my friends, I want to see them. And if you keep grumbling, the 45 you have will be noticed. Let's say 40. What for? They are 45... Against your 19. The experience is on my side. - Were you with Marcelo? - Yes, he seems pleased. I think this trip will be good, he needs to perk up a bit. He is very ... very little man for his age. Sure, he is not 45. I'm sure he is virgin. He doesn't even imagine what is a woman. Listen, are you going out this evening? You'll want to see your friends. Yes, I thought of going out, if you don't have another plan. No, no. I like that you enjoy these days in Buenos Aires. Why don't you take Marcelo? Maybe he'll meet someone who will wake him up a bit. Someone to make him a man? A man like you? Macho. Why not? Don't you like me like this? No, I don't like you, I love you. I don't know why, but I love you. - How much gives your "iron"? - 170, it's super. What foot do you have? - A 450x16. Do you hear? This is my world. How are you Todo? How is Villa Lugano? Must be an opiate to live there. Does this make you feel more important? Go to hell! Darling, do you choose your friends at the zoo? He's a mild mercurial. Celia. You are here! Here is the pest. Waiter, a whiskey! You have a lovely color. Let me kiss you in the elbow. An erogenous zone! One of your Erroneous Zones. Go away, miss best seller. I knew she'd come back. This idea of ​​going to the country... Tastes are tastes, but the fuck pulls. I would have also gone... with the guy who picked her up. Go away, fat, not even Hulk would pick you up. Todo, it's me. I'm Celia, come on, do not play the mummy. And that, what is it? Please do not bother him. And that, what is it? Marcelo, come, sit down, I will introduce you to my friends. This is Siete Lunas*. (*seven moons) we call her that because she is in the moon seven days a week. This is Rulo*, you can imagine why. (*curl) This is Martín Pescador*. (*kingfisher) He is on the fish all the time, fishing anything One should not get within range. And this is Todo*. (*everything) You did not tell us who is the gentleman. Marcelo, he is Marcelo Lecube. He has a full name! Lecube. Marcelo Lecube. He is the son of that guy. The son of Roberto, yes, so what? The son of the groom. How romantic! What boyfriend, he is the son of the macho. The rancher. Hey Celia, does he call you mommy? Let's see, thingy, come closer. - Please. - Come, I tell you. Yes sir. You're not bad. You're pretty cute. - Why did you call me sir? - I don't know. Don't bother him, do it for me. For you? What did you do for me? Never call me sir, call me Todo. I'm not a sir, I am Todo. Yes sir... Let's take a ride, you too. Come on! Let's go! Not you, go with Rulo. Come little girl, come. Mount the "iron". Are you afraid of me? Poor Saruso, who would say? - On Sunday he was so good. - And yesterday puff. - Idiot! Poor Saruso! - For Saruso! - Cheers! - Cheers. - Rest in peace. - Hurrah Saruso! - He was a dirty old man. Divine! I love it, I swear, I love it. It's like making love. - Marcelo, wait. - Leave him to vomit in peace. You are a beast. You don't like beasts? You liked them before. Girl! When you want another ride, let me know. It's free! The music comes in through every hole in the body. - Not only by ... - It goes in one ear and ... out the other. It enters me through both ears, and the nose, and the mouth, and it stays here, inside the head. All the pleasure comes in through the holes. Oh, dear crazy old lady. Delete the old. And call me ... dear crazy young girl. Delete the young and keep the dear. Leave the crazy, I like that more than anything. The music goes in through every part. - What's your name? - Marcelo, and yours? I'm Lucía. Don't feel bad. They don't see, I do. What do you see? A boy... alone Marcelo, come, it's better that you join the group. They are not bad, they are just as they are. You'll know them, you'll like them. Not now, Celia, I better get back to the hotel. You know, I'm a little tired. Marcelo, Why do you want to come back? Don't be afraid. I am not afraid, I'm bored. - Tell me, do you like me? - A lot. - A lot more than the others. - Who are you talking about? Susana, last year, Maria Luisa the previous year. Friends of Dad, of course. They came before you. - You are different. - Why am I different? I'm not sure. They were about your age, but they were grown up and you're a girl, you did not grow up. Do you think so? Tell me, Marcelo, What is better: being young or being old? I want to be like dad. I know that, but what I mean is ... ...how difficult to explain. We young people are far away from old people. Who is to blame? Them or us? Sometimes they seem so unsympathetic, so fearful, But what about people my age? We are so empty. We are so different. The old ones don't understand us. And we don't understand them. Celia, where are you? - Here, Marcelo, with you. - But a lot more with dad, right? I was taking a shower, dad. Good morning. Good morning, son. Well, well, well, It seems you already have some hairs. Dad, I'd rather you don't look at me. Shame between men? Marcelo, you disappoint me. Anyway, I hope it will soon pass. I came to tell you I'm going downtown with Celia. She wants a Gucci purse and some Fiorucci trinket. She says it is a ... compensation for the previous ones. Did you tell her something about... the others? It was an accident. I did not realize it, forgive me. Forgive you? On the contrary, my dear, you did what you had to do. A woman should never be too sure of the man next to her. - Why? - I don't know Because they are animals with long hair and short ideas. - There are many with short hair. - Well, well ... Looks like you're getting smart. For cigarettes, for a drink. or for something better, with long or short hair. Here rest those who preceded us in the way of life this is a respectable place, to be respected Don't fix signs or write legends. Come on, up. Up, I said. Don't be a pussy. I'm sorry, I don't mean it, come on. What for? Don't you want to know my cave? I have weed, whiskey if you like it. - Let's go? - No Not joints nor drinks. Do you prefer something else? Or are you also scared of the body? Let me take you a picture! - Take this man out of here. - Let me take you a picture. Take all orders from last week and review them. It is your responsibility hereinafter Come on, come on! Grandma I'm here. - Do you want mate? - What time is it? - It doesn't matter. - Then it's late. Who is the guy next to you? - A friend. - Ah, as always! No, this is like never. - Do you live here? - Yes, with my grandmother. Others live with their parents. - You know how things are. - What things? Are you idiot? With whom do you live? With my father. You see? Like everyone. Young people have to live with the old, eat with them, do what they say. As if we had something in common. We are different races. I hate old people! I'll never obey them. That's why I live with my oldest. She is so old that she doesn't fuck anyone I thought that ... That I am posh? Nonsense. In the morning I work in the food market and in the evening I grab the bike and ... - Smoke? - No. - Drink? - No. - Then what? - Nothing, I want nothing. How come you want nothing? Don't you like my house? You don't like my grandmother? You don't like how I live? But talk, martian of shit! Do you think I am like you? I'm not like you. Nor you are like me. Let's get out of this shit. I'll drive you. To your place. Northern Quarter. To Recoleta. Do you know what you are? Do you know what we are? A generation of test-tube We can not comment, we have to keep the pace and obey. Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir. They think for us. Do you realize, idiot? That's why we invent costumes. To be free despite all the pressures and taboos. But why do I say this? You won't understand anything. Go away. You're in your place. Recoleta, Northern Quarter. The farm of Ñato*, bye. (*cemetery) - Hello. - Hello. Tell me something about you. Do you know something? I'd like to be like my dad. Talking to him, tell him my stuff. He is so important. Travel with him, just the two of us. Do you know? I would like to share his room. It's your turn. Hey! Why are you barefoot? Why are you barefoot? You're right, the two of us barefoot. There are no thistles like in the field. It rained in Azul, it seems, 50 millimeters. - It's good for sunflower. - Yes, yes. Don't you think we should be on the field? - The foreman is there. - Carabiglia? Yes, he is a guy to trust. He is trustworthy, true, but I'd like to be with you in the field. But he is with Celia. Last year it was Susana, the year before, María Luisa. He is right, it seems, a guy in his forties needs a woman by his side. Dad said I would understand with time. I want to be like dad. Celia says he is beautiful. What about your mom? Have I not seen you in a bathing suit? Yes, but it always seems to me that being in briefs is worse than being naked. Anyway, this time I spare you. In fact I came to convey a very special invitation. To whom? To me? Mr. Roberto Lecube, and Celia Valenti, that's me, have the honor to invite Mr. Marcelo Lecube, that's you, to eat with them tonight. Phenomenal, okay. With the condition that the dinner is in the most expensive restaurant. - Your wishes will be granted. - You may leave, thanks. You deserve them, child. Men who drink wine are real men. To improve your English. Thank you. In April I will travel to New York, It is a fantastic city, I would like you to come with me. Think about it, and don't worry about school, I'll talk to the Father Burque, there won't be any problem. It's time for you to know something of the world, don't you think? And me, I'm your father, I must teach you how to live. - What if I learn alone? - Alone? No one learns alone. And I assure you, you won't find a teacher like me. And you, what did he teach you? - Marcelo, please. - What did he teach you? - It's not your business. I would like to be like you, Dad, tall, strong, beautiful, like a tiger, a wild horse, a shark. Celia, why do you sleep with Dad? Go back to the hotel, immediately. It's Celia's pet. And look how cute he got. I love it! I love it! I love it! Go away, fat hinge. I'm the fisher. This tie is for me. Do you know? I'll hang it next to the poster of Bo Derek. Stop it. What is this, sweetie? A love novel? It is to improve my English. Look! He will improve his English from the waist down. Here! To improve your English. Thank you. Do you know why they call me Todo, sweetie? Because I am everything. Everything means something fantastic. Brutal! Great! Terrific! The best. Todo is everything. He notices everything. Music. An invitation. There, near the corner. Very late, at the time you like. Ring the bell like this... Friends? Get away insolent. Don't you see I'm talking to myself. Excuse me. Here. Later, there's a party. How do you heal yourself from music? - It itches me. - Me? I don't know. I ... I don't talk to strangers. And all are strangers. So I talk to myself. Do not mess with me. The downside would be if there was no music. Because without music I would not itch. And scratching is cute. Music! Music! Music! Music! Does music itches you? I want more music. Does your heart itches you? I don't know, I don't know. Maybe so. Maybe one day I will look like you. - I was waiting for you. - What for? To tell you something that I can only tell to you, not to the others. Why not to the others? Because the others would not understand that everything... is the same as nothing. Celia, why do you sleep with Dad? Idiot! But what an idiot. - Hey. - What's wrong? It looks like you had nightmares. Yes. I mean, no. Don't panic, I didn't come to talk about last night. And why did you come? I dunno. Your father went to Montevideo, for business, he will be back this evening. I went for a walk but look how it rains. I'm sick of the rain. It may be good for the country, but here is crap. I came to talk to someone. With me? Why not? Are you mute? - Come on, dress and let's "do egg". - Do what? I forgot that you're not from here, you don't know the code.. To "do egg" is to do nothing. They are fads. To "do egg" is to do nothing. To "reduce the panic" is to remove a concern. To be very "stone" is feeling very well. You cannot say "wait for me", you have to say "bancame". If you really like someone, she is "an incredible one". To have "un toco de minas" is to have a lot of girls. - By the way, do you like some girl? - No - Actually, I... - Actually, you're a liar. - I saw you with a girl - She is just a child. She is only 14. The mature guy spoke. Let me see that nose, big man. That's why you have so many pimples, let me remove them. Your dad says men do not complain. - But Dad is ... - Dad is Dad. Later, if you want, we will pick up Roberto. With whom did you cheated on me, my love? With myself. I came to pick you up and the sun came out. - But what are you doing crazy? - Crazy about you. - The hotel is near. - The car is here. - Am I a car? - You're my latest model. Why would he not eat with us? He refused, he simply said he was not hungry. It's almost an insolence. Did you talk to him about his behaviour in Harpers that night? I am not the one to broach the subject with your child. You are another insolent girl. Please two brandies to the reading room. Come on. It seems like you trying to make him look ridiculous. ¿Look ridiculous? He is ridiculous and that worries me. You only worry about yourself. You are wrong. Thank you. He is my son, I worry about him. But what do you worry about? Marcelo is a very normal guy. Not so normal. He is always alone, isolated, sad. It's a lot of work to talk to him. Probably because you don't talk of what interests him. Nothing interests him. He is not interested in people, he has no friends. What you care about is that he doesn't have girl friends. Well, yes. So what? - At his age I was different. - Sure! At his age you had slept with the whole country. Not so much, but I had my experience. Let Marcelo alone. He will have his experience. The experience of masturbation. Doctors and analysts say it is natural. You know what I think of psychoanalysis. You are a retrograde monster. The only thing you are missing is to go with him to a brothel. - That's what my dad did with me. - The family tradition. - The sluts, the farm .... - Don't tease me Now, let's talk frankly I'm trying to make you leave your child alone. So that he ends up a fagot? You are such a beast! I repeat what I told you more than once, that kid needs tenderness. He always needed it, who gave it to him? - His mother? - He did not meet his mother. And that thing about tenderness is nonsense. - I think I hate you. - Because you love me? Yeah, yeah. Sadly. Silly. I give you everything you need and much more. Of course. Business is business. You provide for me and I have to obey. You just said you love me. Yes, but I also said sadly. If I felt unhappy, would you help me? I think that's what I would like most in the world. So why do not you help me? You know I love Marcelo, my son, my only son. Please Roberto, Can you tell me clearly what you think? The boy is not ugly. - Marcelo, I mean - Clearly. - And he has me worried. - Clearly. He is going for 17 and he still doesn't know what is a woman. You are 19, you are really cute, experienced, smooth. And healthy, dear, very healthy. You did not need a certificate from me. So far I haven't infected you with anything. The ironies make you older, love. I just turned 100 thousand years. Then you're going to understand me better. The kid looks to you in a rather special way, tonight you could pay him a visit, in his room, in his bed. Motherfucker! But, hey! Document. Well, well, you are a minor, at this time is better for you to be at home. Yeah yeah. Thank you. GOOD BYE CELIA Did he dumped you, skinny? Rather I left. Not one bag? I took them already. To your folks'? Yeah. Can you believe that they greeted me as if I had left yesterday? I can believe anything. Come on. Why are we here? What does one do in a place like this? - Do you want me? - I don't know. And do you want me? I don't know either, but since we are here. Since we are here... we can look at the scenery, vaults, domes, crosses, angels, death... Hey, is it the father or the son? We better go. Better, it would be another failure. Yours or mine? You know, of the two of us. - Hello, good day. - Good morning, dad. It's sunny, it seems. It seems so, yes. Can I sit next to you? Sure. Do you know anything about Celia? They are like that. Who? Women. It will be good for us to spend the rest of the holiday alone. I will ask them to pass your stuff to my room. Your jacket suits me very well. You have the same complexion as me. It's what I always wanted to have. If you add old, I'll kill you. I won't add that, but I tell you: I would like to be your age. Dad, I met a woman. Did you have anything with her? I saw her two or three times. - ¿The girl? - No dad, she is a woman. I mean a woman older than me. She is very cute. No, she is beautiful. That is, beautiful. I would like to know her. I don't know if I'd like you to meet her. It's her. He's your son. He's our son. Are you alone? - Yes. - Okay, let's get ice cream.
