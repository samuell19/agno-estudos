Attention all cars in blue area. This is a code three. Murderer George Morley escaped custody. Killer believed heading in direction of the Queensboro Bridge. All units in the blue area proceed with caution. Don't jump, Morley. Don't try it. Climb down. Let the officers help you. If you jump, you'll never get away. There's a police boat standing by. Keep them away! Do you hear me? Keep them away! Isn't that George Morley, the murderer? Yeah, he gave up like a lamb. They can find a sponsor for anything nowadays. Keep them away! You hear me? Take them away! Blackburn, I can fire a few shots over his head. Out of the question. Might scare him and then jump in. Driver, can't you find some way out of this? No chance, lady, traffic's backed up to 72nd Street. You've got a chance, Morley. If you don't come down now, we'll wait till you have to. Take them away! Hey you, no spectators in there. Hey, how did you get through the line? I'm Dr. Hamilton, James Hamilton. Yes, what is it, doctor? I think I can help you. Oh, he don't need a doctor. Hasn't jumped yet. I'd like to talk into that microphone for a few minutes. How about it, Morley? You're coming down? Listen, I'm a psychiatrist. Please, doc. I've read about Morley in the papers, He's an obsessive of highly suggestible mentality. Of what? What I'm trying to say is... he might respond to suggestion. I'd like to try. What harm will five minutes do? I've been trying for a half hour. Five minutes? All right, here's the mic. Morley... This is Dr. Hamilton. I want you to listen to the sound of my voice. Watch the searchlight. I'll miss my plane. He's a goner for sure. Look at him. Driver, please. Look, lady, if you don't wanna watch them, nobody's stopping you from walking. That'll be a buck and eighty, ma'am. Yes, sorry, I forgot. You will do as I say. You want to do as I say. You will do absolutely nothing, but listen to my voice and watch the light. You will do as I say. You want to do as I say. Your eyes are on the light. On the light. Watch... watching the light. You will do absolutely nothing but listen to my voice and watch the light. You trust me. You trust me, Morley. You will do as I say because you know I want to help you. I can help you. I can help you. Your fingers hold tight. You cannot open them. They will not open. - Hypnosis. - They are welded to the cable. Your hands can not open. They are part of the cable, welded there. Morley, let your fingers open. Open. Open. That's right. Let them open. Let them open. You will let the two officers help you. Help you. Help you. Let me have your name again, doctor. Hamilton. I'll... uh... we'll call you if we need you. Hey, doc, we want a statement. Good afternoon, Dr. Hamilton's office. No, I'm sorry, the doctor is not here right now. - Dr. Hamilton? - The press? - Yes. - Excuse me. I'm Thompkins, of "The Globe". - Barnes of "The Recorder", doctor. - No comment. My paper wants a statement, doctor. Our readers would like to know, doctor. Doctor, whether you like it or not, you're news. Is it true that you put Morley in a hypnotic trance? No, it's not true. I use no hypnotherapy and I don't like being referred to as a Park Avenue Svengali. Well, you are a hypnotist, aren't you, doctor? Miss Ames, will you cancel my appointments for the rest of the day? Like many psychiatrists I often use hypnotism in my work. But you can't deny what so many people saw. You put that murderer in a definite trance. Morley happened to be a criminal of high suggestibility, of very low intelligence. I used simple suggestion and it worked. It was very little more than... a game they used to call animal magnetism in the days of Kawai and Binet. Now, since you gentlemen won't leave, you'll excuse me if I do. - One question, doc, before you go. - Please! - We know he killed three young women. - That's right. Now at each case there was no motive. No sex, no robbery. Can you tell us why? A drive to kill, that's all. The man's a killer through and through. Sorry, I'll have to leave you now, gentlemen. I'm sorry, but I think you're in the wrong car. Do you mind? I'm in a hurry. You're not another reporter. No, I'm not. I only wanna talk to you, doctor. I'm... I'm sure you'd be lovely to talk to, but not today. Come on. Out. Please, Dr. Hamilton, I need your help. You could've called my office and made an appointment. I tried. They told me you were booked up months ahead. - Keep trying. Look, Miss. - Ann, Ann Summers. Miss Summers, this town has almost as many psychiatrists as taxi drivers. All you have to do is whistle. Are you always so slippy? You always use such heavy perfume? Did you have any trouble finding the car? None. - Parking attendant? - Parking attendant. - Well, what is your case? - I don't know. - Last night... - You were at the bridge. Yes, I was on my way to the airport, flying to London. And the traffic jam made you miss your plane. Oh, yes. Almost, yes... I... I found myself unable to open my hands as you spoke. It frightened me. And then this morning I read in the papers your statements about people often being highly suggestible. Yes but I was referring to the criminal mind. I hope you haven't made the haywire conclusion that because you are suggestible you have a criminal mentality. I don't know. it's ridiculous, forget it. But there are moments when I feel like... and then I keep running away. You're a very lovely girl, and I'd much rather take you to dinner than take you as a client. I don't take friends as patients or make my patients personal friends. What I'm trying to say, Miss Summers, is I won't take you as a patient. It would only waste your money and my time. Hey, Doc! Excuse me. Hey, boy! Doc Hamilton! Set! You'll excuse me if I don't leap over the net and shake your hand. Nice game, Charlie. Yeah, I think I should have to hang up my racket. Resign myself today. Minor pleasant treats of old age. - What'll you have to drink? - Got any old Scotch? Waiting for you. Oh, here we are. Help yourself, will you? I'm not having any. You on the wagon? I've got a History Department meeting tonight. I've often debated whether I should get drunk before or after these things. Tell me, what's new in 18th-century Europe? Well, Frederick the second has just marched into Silesia. Sit down, will you? 'Twas quite a carnival-like you got yourself into last night. If I knew a good psychiatrist, I'd have my head examined. Oh, what you need is a wife. I had one once, I don't make the same mistake twice. It's not good for a doctor's reputation living the way you do, Jim. What does that mean? You're around bars, picking up women. Of, course they're the best bars and the best women. And through last night I won't be able to trade my reputation for a dry martini, so let's forget it. An historian never forgets. Let's hope the public does. Good morning. - At the telephone, doctor. - Who is it? Police Department, inspector Blackburn. Okay. Dr. Hamilton speaking. Yes, inspector, fine. How are you? Oh, about that Morley. I see. Very possibly, a traumatic effect. Yes, I've been wanting to study Morley for my own research as well. I'll be glad to. By all means. I'll drive up later this afternoon. Fine. Fine. A new perfume you're wearing, doctor? No, same one I've always used. Yes. Yes, this is Dr. Hamilton's office. Uh... an appointment? No, I'm sorry. Well, all right, I'll write down. Miss... Ann Summers. Well, I... I don't know. Oh, just a moment, please. Hello, Miss Summers. It's Dr. Hamilton. Yes, I can take you. Where are you now? Fine, you can come right over. Oh, I meant to tell you that you forgot.... Hello? She hung up. Both your parents were English. Yes. And you've never studied German. No. Then, why should you be reading a novel in German? German? Why do you ask? These are your gloves, aren't they? Yes. Well, they were inside this book. Are you sure? My book? I don't remember. You said something about finding mysterious messages. What about them? Oh, they too are in German. I began finding them about three or four months ago. Sometimes in my pocketbook and sometimes beside my bed. Did you recognize the handwriting? No, I'd never seen it before. What characteristics did it have? Can you describe it? Plain? Fancy? Sort of like the handwriting on wedding invitations. Fancy scroll type. How old are you? 25. What are you're doing in New York, business or pleasure? Pleasure, I guess, you might say. Thank you. I travel a lot, I never stay in one place too long. Support yourself? Father left me a substantial income. That takes care of my expenses. My mother died when I was around 4. About this constant traveling, you say you keep running away. Yes, I feel driven to it, as if I was searching for something or some place. Do you often forget things, like leaving your things in my car? Sometimes, often I guess. Nice thing. Ever been married? No. Ever been in love? Is that important? It's my business to know everything about you. No, I guess I've never been in love. How about your moods? You generally happy, depressed? A little of both, I guess, like everyone else. Pardon me, doctor, but you're due at the police station in 40 minutes. That's right, I almost forgot. I promised the State Psychiatrist to report. Would you call him, Miss Ames, to tell him I'm on my way? Well, I think that about does it for today. Why don't you go back to your hotel and get some rest? Miss Ames will arrange for your next appointment. I don't suppose I could interest you for dinner tonight. No. I'm sorry, not tonight. Besides, you're contradicting yourself. Oh? Yes, you told me you never make your friends patients, or your patients personal friends. Oh, he hasn't said a word since the bridge. Just won't talk. I'd like to see him alone. Oh! Oh, not a chance. Hey, you're visiting a murderer. Don't you forget it. He might decide to swat a fly or he might decide to strangle you. - I can handle him. - Okay, Joe, open up. You got a visitor, Morley. It's Dr. Hamilton. Hello, Morley. Do you like a cigarette? You know who I am? You can call me Jim. Your first name is George, isn't it? Okay if I call you George? Can you see this flashlight, George? I want you to keep your eyes on it. You'll feel very restful. It will help calm you inside. And help you to forget. Watch the light. Keep your eyes on it. It makes you sleepy. Relax. Sleepy. You want to sleep, to forget. Relax. And as I count to ten, your eyelids will close and you will be asleep. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. You're asleep. How old are you? - Achtzen.* [Eighteen]. What? Achtzen!* [Eighteen!] You will speak in English. How old are you? Eighteen. But you told me before you were 25. I am 18. Who taught you to speak German? That is a stupid question. You spoke German as a child? Naturally. Are you a German citizen? Nein*. [No.] I was born in Vienna. Where did you live as a child? Many places. Where? We had a summer house in... in... A summer house? Ich kann mich nicht erinnern.* *[I can't remember.] I said to answer in English. Do you remember other houses? One with wild chestnut trees. Wild chestnut trees. Was it in the country? Yes, in the country. Dogs barking. Your dogs? No. But a lot of dogs? Yes. Dogs, horses... Fox hunting? No, we did not live there, only... only... Only what? Was it a hunting lodge? Yes, hunting. Did something happen at the hunting lodge that you were trying to forget? Try to answer. He... he... Someone hurt you? Nein, nein. Ich kann es nicht.* *[No, no... I can't!] Speak in English. No! No, I cannot kill you! I cannot kill you! No, don't do it, darling. Let me go first. I am such a coward and I love you so. You take the revolver first. Drop your hands. Drop your hands. Do as I say. We cannot live without each other. We must both die. You will think of other things. Something happy. What is making you smile? He's kissing my ear. Who is kissing your ear? Rudi. Are you in love with Rudi? Everyone is in love with him. You were 18 when you were in love with Rudi? Yes. Is he in love with you? Quite madly, but you must not tell anyone. Are you planning on getting married? That is impossible. Why? It is impossible. His father... Doesn't his father approve of you? Of course not. Why not? You asked a stupid question. You must know. Know what? That Rudi is already married. Did all this happen in England? No. Where? Hunting lodge. Vienna? Yes, near Vienna. Everything is so beautiful. A smell of spring, white lilacs. Why were you going to England? England? Is Rudi there? I do not know. When was the last time you saw Rudi? That night. That night at the hunting lodge? Yes. All right. You will slowly open your eyes. You will watch the light. Open your eyes. Open them. Watch the light. As the light fades, you will awaken. You will feel refreshed and relaxed. How do you feel? Fine. - Headache? - No. Good. Then, tonight we'll have dinner together, and I won't take no for an answer Club Sissy? Club Sissy. You're fond of the outdoors, aren't you? Trees, flowers... Yes, I guess I am. And you like places, you like to travel. How about Vienna? Vienna? Yes, when were you there last? I haven't been to Vienna. Are you telling me the truth? Of course. I see. Would you like your order, doctor? No, I'll give her another 15 minutes. Oh, quel r?ve cette mademoiselle!* *[It must be a dream girl!] Let me have a telephone, please. Oh, mais oui, at once, docteur. Gar?on! He looks so familiar... Who is he? Oh, of course that bridge thing. - It's that hypnotist. - Doctor, my dear. Quack! What a charming quack he must be! I've been thinking of changing my analyst. Hotel Royal Plaza? Would you ring Miss Summers' room, please? Yes, Ann Summers. Pardon, doctor, a messenger just brought this note for you. What do you mean she hasn't registered there? Ann Summers. She told me... All right. Thanks. Hello, Charlie. Jim. Fine. You got a second? I want you to translate some German for me. Yeah, go ahead, Jim. "Es tut mir leid." What was that last word? Yeah. Well, it says: "I am terribly sorry I cannot keep our date". Positive. And I might add it's not very perfect German. Badly-written, huh? Well, thanks Charlie. And I hope I didn't disturb Frederick II. See you soon. Captain! Oui, monsieur.* *[Yes, sir] I'll have my dinner at the bar. As you wish, doctor. Something in a glass. Water... and put it in a champagne glass. Pardon? I can't afford your liquor, only your glasses. And I'm very thirsty. Tout de suite*. *[Quickly,] bring me some water, Pierre. My name is not Pierre. I thought we'd have something in common. Neither is mine. - A double scotch, Joe. - Yes. Two of the loveliest words in the English language. Hello, Dr. Hamilton. I'm Cullen, general assignment reporter, Affiliated Press. No comment. Hmm, two of the ugliest words in the English language. Ah, just a little experiment in psychology, doctor. I sit here with a champagne glass and I'm taken for a socially acceptable lush, when the truth of the matter is I am socially unacceptable. Despite the popular euphemism, a gentlemen of the press. I am not a lush because of a peptic ulcer and my doctor's orders are that I can drink only milk or water. So here I sit, drinking water from a champagne glass, just because I can't stay out of bars. What do you think of my case, doctor? if I told you, you'd worry. I like to worry. You've got a peptic, what do you wanna shoot for? Duodenum? In my case, it really doesn't matter. Uh, here I am, sitting next to a big story and he won't even talk. Office hours end at 5. Yours do, not mine. How about it, doctor? Any repercussions on this Morley thing? Okay, live by that sundial of yours, but one of these days I'm going to come into your office before 5. Est pour vous, Pierre*, *[For you, Pierre.] Live a little. Come in. - Dr. Hamilton, Miss Summers - Come in, Miss Summers. I don't like my patients to lie to me. Do I lied to you? I'm terribly sorry. You told me you were staying at the Royal Plaza Hotel. That wasn't necessary. No, it wasn't necessary. Are you afraid of me, Ann? I was... a little, but I don't think I am anymore. Still you wouldn't have dinner with me. - But you don't understand... - And this note... At least you could have written it in English. I sent you a note? Would you believe me if I told you I don't remember sending you this note? All I remember is getting dressed to meet you. And that's all. And you don't remember anything else about last night at all? No, just... the dress, I remember putting it on and... And blank? Yes, blank. Until this morning. I couldn't find any money for a cab. Someone had hid my purse. That's why I was late. Did you find your purse? Yes. Someone had put it behind the curtain, pinned it up high. Pinned behind the curtains... Do you have any idea who did it? No. Tell me, Ann, has this sort of thing happened before? Yes. How about memory blackouts? Yes. For whole days? No, this is the first time. - Last night you mean? - Yes. Tell me, Ann, where do you live? 87 Sutton Place. Alone? No, with a friend of the family. I stay there whenever I'm in New York. All right. Now, just relax and we'll have another look at your subconscious. The river was always muddy. The Danube? The Danube canal. What else do you remember about Vienna? Heurigen. What is Heurigen? Fresh wine. We would go to Grinzig and sit in the Garden Caf?, always in the corner, and drink Heurigen. With Rudi? Yes. He would always meet me in some disguise, so we would not be recognized. My black hair, that's what he loved most. My black hair. But your hair is blonde. Don't be absurd. I am famous for my hair. Then you had it dyed blonde. H?bschen*. *[Pretty] Ann, why do you insist that you have never been to Vienna, when you know it so well? My name is not Ann. What is your name? Maria. I am Baroness Maria. Why have you taken the name Ann Summers? That is her name, not mine. Split personality. Then you are the Baroness Maria and she is Ann Summers. Of course. And you are 18. I told you that. And you have black hair. I am very beautiful, even Loschek will tell you. Loschek? Rudi's valet, don't you know him? I remember the icy roads to Vienna. The coach wheels. You mean the car wheels. Coach wheels. We stopped in Baden to change horses. We... we... Go on. To change the horses. Why do you ask me these questions? I'm trying to help you. You're trying to kill me! You don't really believe that, do you, Ann? Not Ann, Maria! Maria, did you hide Ann's purse behind the drapes? Yes, I pinned it there, but you must not tell her. Why? I don't like her coming to see you. Are you afraid? You don't like me. You want to kill me! Perhaps I will kill you first! Tell me more about the lodge. Little angels all colors painted on the wall, and looking down into the bedroom. The music box! it's playing our waltz. Crystal chandelier with a hundred candles dancing. Go on. It's January. Outside the dogs are barking in the snow, but we are so warm inside. You said January, what year? January 1889. Schizophrenia, dual or split personality call it what you like, but I'm not sure all those names and places make sense. Rudi, Grinzig, Loschek... The hunting lodge, heurigen wine, wild chestnut trees... She knows what she's talking about. I only wish I did. The heurigern section of Vienna was once a pretty badly hit by the plague. No, no, that was in the 17th Century. January 1889, she said it twice. What is that name she called herself? Maria, Baroness Maria. I'm afraid I'm not gonna get much sleep tonight. Yes. Oh, hello, Charlie. No, no, I'm not asleep. I'm sorry to bother you Jim, but I think... you better come over here for breakfast. About nine o'clock? Hey, what time is it anyway? It's 3:00 a.m. I think I found your Maria. In a history book. Put on the coffee, I'll be right over. This is the photograph of the woman your client thinks she is. Baroness Maria Vetsera, lover of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria. Crown Prince Rudolf? Checks with the nickname Rudi, doesn't it? Go on. History books tell us that Rudolf's father, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, knew about this love affair. Naturally, he objected because Rudolf was already married. And here we have our missing hunting lodge, near Vienna. Mayerling, surrounded by wild chestnut trees. Sound of barking dogs. What could be more natural than dogs in a hunting lodge? The Mayerling affair, the Mayerling affair. I think it's in history isn't it? Oh, it's hardly ancient. And it's one of the most famous scandals in all history. Look here. In the very year that you mentioned, 1889, January 28 to be exact, the valid, Loschek, discovered a scene that later rocked the entire continent of Europe. That night, at Mayerling, he knocked on Rudolf's door. Suddenly there was a shot from within. He broke the door in and found Rudolf lying dead with the gun still in his hand. Beside him, shot dead hours before, was Maria Vetsera. A dual suicide. Two lovers dying because they couldn't have each other in life. Because they couldn't have each other in life... I'm not arguing with you, Maria. Of course, you are the Baroness Maria Vetsera and you died at Mayerling with the Crown Prince Rudolf in 1889. It was snowing. It was Wednesday. They found us on Wednesday morning. They hid me in the shed behind the lodge. They couldn't leave me the way I was, so they put a fur coat around me. It was hideous to be treated that way! All they talked about was the scandal, that I must not be found there, even dead. Relax, Maria. You are hurting yourself. Open your hands. Open your hands. Open them. You will take your handkerchief in your hand. And dead took me in the coach back to Vienna. No more! You win, I'm so tired... - Enjoying yourself? - Oh, very much. Say, all your patients get this treatment? When they need it. Admit it: aren't you glad I twisted your arm into coming out today? Ask to my subconscious. Not on my afternoon off! Hi, honey. What can I do for you, sir? I am a very sick man. Where's the doctor? I'm afraid Dr. Hamilton isn't in right now, but I expect him to call. Hmm. Maybe I'll wait here. I don't think he's the kind of doctor that you want. Well, he's a vet, isn't he? My cat is expecting another litter and... I'm a very sick man. Have you ever tried to give away cats in the city of New York? Don't let me get on your nerves. Ah, ulcer pills. I've got to speak with the doctor. Oh, just a minute, you can't go in there! Now look at that beautiful couch! You know, honey, I didn't get much sleep last night. If the doc calls in, tell him I'm here. My name is Cullen. And please, honey, wake me up in about 20 minutes, hmm? I'm not arguing with you Maria. Of course you are the Baroness Maria Vetsera. And you died at Mayerling with the Crown Prince Rudolf in the year 1889. Editors. Oh, yes, Cullen, shoot. Doc Hamilton's on a reincarnation kick. All I want you to do for me is to put a rewrite man on one extension and a shorthand gal on the other, and, brother, you've got the biggest headline since flying saucers. ...and then they took me in the coach back to Vienna. Ann, you must have come across the German language at some time in your life I thought this was my day off. Think back, are you sure that your parents never took you to Austria? - As a child, I mean. - Quite sure. You never studied German in college? Oh, French: "le livre est sur la table, oui?* *['The book in on the table, yes?'] Tr?s bien. How far back into your childhood can you remember? Hmm... about eight or nine, I think. - No further than that? - I'm very stupid, I warned you. After your mother died, did your father bring you up alone? He never married again if that's what you mean. Sorry, no evil stepmother you can put under your microscope. Did you love your father very much? Very much. Jim, are my lapses of memory up to increase? That's hard to tell. I've... I've read about people who black out for six months or a year. They turn up in some little town in Nebraska or Switzerland under another name. Is that going to happen to me? Some little thing, a disappointment, a shock of some kind could put you in a very serious state. You told me you never make personal friends out of your patients. I think I can understand that now. Don't be ridiculous, I'm going to send you a bill. I might even pad it to cover the cookies. It's so horrifying to think that there's this other person within me. Sort of a genie just waiting for somebody to pull the cork. At least she's a Baroness. You travel in the best society. Please don't joke about it. Defense mechanism. I always joke about the things I'm most serious about. Like you. Well, I have a few defense mechanisms of my own. You still don't trust me, do you? Not even if I told you that I'm falling in love with you? With me? Or Maria Vetsera. Why don't you go to the front office where you belong? I didn't hire you to get us into a lawsuit. Yellow journalism added up 50 years ago. Look, I draw my check for bringing news. Now, do I write the story or don't I? Look, I know all about the responsibility of the press. I've been a good boy scout all my life. I've waved flags and I've helped the old ladies across the street, but let's face it, this will make banner lines for a week. Do you wanna sell papers or do you wanna win merit badges? Boss, do I write the story or do I shuffle off to my favorite milk bar? I'm telling you to kill the story. Let me outline the consequences if you pen it. We've been over that, Hamilton will sue. He'll not only sue, he'll win. The trial will make good copy and if you can sell more papers than the amount we have to settle for out-of-court when the time comes, you're still way ahead of the game. Bill, you've been my city editor for 18 years. I want you to know if you go ahead with this, you'll take the responsibility for whatever happens. Cullen, stop standing around wasting time, find the typewriter. Mine is not to reason why, mine is but to write or di Jim, I really had a wonderful time. I'm glad you did. Jim, you haven't discussed me with anyone, have you? I mean I don't wanna be a case in a medical journal. Stop worrying. Oh, Jim if you insist on taking me to dinner I guess we better change, huh? Yeah. Guess we'd better. Well, Fr?ulein*, what's the next stop? *[Miss] 87 Sutton Place. Oh, Cullen? Send him right in. Hi, doc. I just came by for a statement. - Did you do this? - Who else? - It's a lie, all of it. - How could you be so moronic? - I've had practice. - Age regression! Coney Island Psychiatry that went out with the dinosaur! - Doc, you're gonna sue? - I want a retraction and quick! Oh, doc you can't retract headlines I advise you to sue. Do you realize what you've done? That business of the bridge was bad enough but now I'll be taken for a carnival doctor selling snake oil. Are you kidding? This will make you the biggest head mechanic in town. Get out of here, Cullen. Look, doc, if I were you I'd strangle me. But supposing it really is reincarnation, well, then it's just too big for you to sit on your Park Avenue office. Get it straight and print it straight. You've blown a fairly simple case of split personality into a hoax. Reincarnation has nothing to do with it. Doc, can you prove it? Look, how come your patient knows all about the Mayerling affair? How come she can talk in German? - That can be explained. - Well, explain it. Get out. Well, I still advise you to sue, doc. but auf Wiedershen*. *[Good-bye] Oh doc, the other papers will probably be in your neck any second. Maybe you should get out of town. Might do you some good. Miss Ames, I am not into anyone. Oh, miss Summers? No, I'll talk to her. Put her on, please. Ann... Ann, I'm sorry. How could you do such a despicable thing? You've got to believe me, I... And who else did you discuss my case with? The janitor? Ann, listen to me. The sound of your voice makes me sick. I've never checked to cover your services. You can cancel the rest of my appointments. I never wanna see you again, Herr Doktor. Ann, Ann... Maria! Tell miss Summers Dr. Hamilton is here. Miss Summers has gone out, sir. I'll tell her myself! - She isn't. - Where's her room? - What is going on here? - Well, it's that gentleman. I've got to see Ann. I'm Dr. Hamilton. Yes, I've read the papers this morning. Ann is in danger. Philip, you will show the gentlemen, as you call him, to the door and through it. Will you listen to me? She's in danger, I tell you. Take me to her. Philip, I think you'd better call the police. Yes, ma'am. If Ann has been in any danger, it has been through you. I would very much appreciate your saving me from the embarrassment of the police. You're wasting your time. Ann left here about 20 minutes ago. Where'd she go? I have known Ann and her family since she was born and in all those years, I have never practiced asking her where she was going. - Good-bye, sir. - Lady Fitzmaurice... Good-bye, sir! I'll go quietly and cause you no trouble, if you allow me two or three minutes to talk to you. - Philip, cancel that call. - Yes, ma'am. There is still a bit of sun... in the parlour. - You may sit down. - Thank you. Young man, what have you done to this poor girl? I'm concerned with what she's up to do to herself. Lady Fitzmaurice, have you ever known Ann to have visited Vienna? - No. - But she speaks the German language. Badly, but it's German. That is quite impossible, sir. She was brought up in the care of private nurses. - English nurses? - Quite naturally. Might one of them have been an Austrian? I do not like this line of questioning. There was an Austrian! Perhaps there was, I've forgotten. You haven't forgotten a thing in 60 years, have you Lady Fitzmaurice? 72 years. How old was Ann during the domestic reign of her Austrian nurse? Ann must have been... almost 8. when her father threw that Viennese hussy out of his house. Do I have to ask why he dismissed her? If you do, I shall not answer you. I understand. Could Ann have become aware of what was going on between her father and her nurse? It's not likely, sir. But it's very possible. Ann might have come upon them at some indiscreet moment and been shocked. Then Ann picked up a smattering of German from the nurse. An impossible language! The nurse must have filled Anne's head with all sorts of romantic tales. Among them the story of Mayerling. A handsome Crown Prince, the beautiful Baroness Maria Vetsera. What more does it take to impress a child's mind? A loathing affair. Then the shock of seeing her Austrian nurse displacing the memory of her own mother in her father's arms. I will not listen to this! Can you imagine the workings of Ann's mind? The hatred she must have felt for that nurse. Then, as Ann grew older, those hateful images must have disappeared from sight. A memory block. Today Ann has forgotten that the nurse ever existed in her life. A good riddance. I want to thank you, Lady Fitzmaurice. Would you have Ann call me the moment she returns? I think you understand how important it is... to her. There's a gentleman here from the police, sir. Thank you, Jones. You let him in. You may come in, sir. - Doctor Hamilton? - That's right. Lieutenant White, Homicide. Homicide? I don't have a warrant, but if you insist, I'll get one. Warrant? Homicide? Say, what is all this? - It's about Ann Summers. - Ann? What's happened to her? Well, that's why I'm here, doctor. Here's a translation of a letter we received this morning. it was written in German. "To whom it may concern:" "This is in the interest of Ann Summers." "Dr. James Hamilton has been trying to... to kill her." "My mind cannot overcome the fear that he has at last succeeded in his deed." "Signed: Maria Vetsera." But this is ridiculous! Psychiatrically, Ann was... We're not interested in the big words, doctor. We're interested in the facts. But there are no facts. This letter suggests the possibility of your having killed Ann Summers. Well, maybe it was written by a crackpot. Maybe not. Maria Vetsera doesn't exist, she's a figment of Ann's imagination. Before you start accusing me of anything, why don't you check? Oh, we have. There's no such person. Look, doctor, we're not accusing you of anything. I'm just here to check. Okay, help yourself. A purse. Look familiar, doctor? Hmm, traveler's checks. About $2,000 worth. All signed by Ann Summers. That makes them negotiable, doesn't it? Oh, a handkerchief. Looks like blood. It is. I can explain that. it's Ann handkerchief, all right. She cut herself in my office the other day. Relax, doctor, relax. We haven't got a murder case... yet . A murder case! But we do have exhibits A, B and C. But the police do not share the cafe gossip that miss Summers, possessed by the person within her, has run off in search of her historical lover Crown Prince Rudolf. How does it sound? You must be proud of yourself. Could get the Pulitzer Prize. For fiction. Okay, I will. Right, captain Yes, sir, I understand. Missing persons is drawing blanks. Well, she might have left the city. If she's alive, we'll find her. And if she's dead, we'll find her. Am I my under arrest? I'll let you know when. Don't be impatient. And so I said to him, imagine I said, I could've been Mary, Queen of Scots. It's getting terrible, really it is. Why, it's one thing to know who your friends are, but it's another to know who they were. Yes, I'm still being followed. Look, Charlie you're working at school. I can meet you at the golf room for lunch, okay? Fine. Fine, that's better. Say, why don't you ride with me? They may need your car for something important. You say the police is still after you? Oh, I hate to bring this up again Jim, but you've got to get that girl off your mind. Are you in love with her? I'm in love with her. That's unfortunate. I can't work. I can't sleep On a diet too? Not hungry. Now tell me, what's new with that Morley fella? Find anything new inside that criminal mind of his? Completely asocial. I have a few more tests to run before they send him to the electric chair. This fruit salad is delicious. I talked to the police lieutenant last night. They had a report. Ann had been seen in New Orleans, but it didn't check out. They're bound to find her. If she's alive. I'm beginning to wonder myself. Jim, history's a game of patience. So is life. She'll turn up. Sure? Don't look now, but my fan club just arrived. She's bound to read something in the papers about your being suspected of murder, I mean, doc. Reincarnation or not, she'll be decent enough to show her face and get you off the hook. That's just it, Charlie. The person of Maria has taken full possession of Ann. And Maria hates me. She's loving every minute of this. One woman with two such different personalities... And it's Maria that you've got to look for and not Ann. That's what I keep telling the police. As you know, there's time needed until they can find a body. How about the Crown Prince Rudolf? What about him? Maybe your Baroness Maria's gone off looking for him. Cut it out, Charlie. Just a thought. What you've said before is right, though. The only thing is... The only thing is what? Hey, wait a minute! Bait. Bait? You can't catch fish without bait. If she's alive I can bring her back by finding Rudolf. Ha! You're so fun, Jim. Eat your salad. No, Charlie, I'm serious. That's ridiculous! Finding Rudolf? Not finding him, creating. Jim boy, you need a rest. I need only one thing, Charlie. I need a killer. Your subconscious will remember everything I say. Your name is Rudolf Von Habsburg. You are the Crown Prince of Austria. Repeat that. My name is Rudolf Von Habsburg. I am the Crown Prince of Austria. Repeat that to me. No, Maria, I would rather die with you than live without you. You know what to do with the gun then, don't you? Yes. Everything I have put in your mind will remain in your subconscious. You will remember nothing when you awaken. Hi, Cullen, I thought I'd find you here. I wanna talk to you. Think I have a story you might be interested in. Be aware of psychiatrists bearing gifts. Keep the cracks for your column. Is reincarnation still selling papers? It's getting a little stale, could use a shot in the arm. Would it make headlines if I told you that I found the reincarnation of Crown Prince Rudolf? What are you trying to hand me? I'm serious, Cullen. One chance in a billion and you found him, huh? Not even my readers would believe that. I did. Think of it. Two lovers reunited after nearly half a century of death. Sam, bring me a scotch. Reincarnation with a sex angle. Ha! Make it a double, Sam. Who is your crown prince? That's my secret. You wanna hear the recording? Well, if I print it, you know what it does to you. Sam, put these on my tab and drink them yourself. Come on. If she comes here first... I shall call you. She's got to come back. You must love her very much, but you are ruining your reputation. I don't care who thinks I'm a fraud as long as Maria believes me. I hope she comes back to you soon. You're doing a very unselfish thing. It's got to lure her back. She'll come back for a Crown Prince, and then, I'll kill her. The news broke this afternoon that Dr. Hamilton has come up with the living reincarnation of the Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria. Some of the principles involved in the story which has become the sensation of the country, are here on film, brought to you exclusively by this television station. Here is the house at 87 Sutton Place, the last known location to be visited by the girl who called herself Maria Vetsera. And here is the beach house on Long Island belonging to the controversial Dr. James Hamilton. Out here by our news camera is Dr. Charles Gore the historian friend of Hamilton. Looks like he's in quite a hurry, doesn't it? What will Dr. Hamilton come up with next? Turning to the European... The Crown Prince! Imagine, isn't it romantic? Do you suppose they'll get married? In this life I mean. How do you like that? The Crown Prince, my foot! He'll lose his license, that doc will. Believe me, if I was the commissioner, I'd pull him in on the bunco charge. Oh, if you were the Commissioner, big man! I swear to it, Bill, I don't know what pigeon he's dug up for this Crown Prince bit. - It could have been anybody. - Even you. Fat chance. Look, see if you can find out who. I'll keep the story open. Now, then what about the criminal he's been brain reading? Might be something for the feature page. Yeah, you mean Morley. I had Dr. Hamilton tailed by one of our fellows the past two weeks. Gave us some good information. Let's see, on Monday he saw Morley from 10:00 to 10:40 and then again on Thursday, and then three times last week. Hey! What? This could be our pigeon. Morley. It figures. The Crown Prince behind bars. Yeah, think of that in print. Listen, I'll go over and check on this and if it's true... watch out. The gun will be behind the book. At the knock on the door, you will pick it up and fire. You will pick it up and fire after the knock. Hold it there, doctor, we can't go along with that. You will close your eyes and hear nothing. No sounds, nothing. I told you I must have a killer mind for this. I understand that, doctor. Are you sure that you told the District Attorney exactly what you're doing? Look, the only reason you haven't pinned the murder on me is because you can't find the corpus delicti. If you charge me and miss Summers turns up suntanned after a few weeks in Florida... Yeah, you could pin our ears back in any court. Our case against you is closed the minute that we see Miss Summers alive. All right, let's get on with it. You can hear me. You can hear my voice. Open your eyes. Hi, doc. Just in time for the four-star. - Hi, Cullen... - Doc... I'm gonna give it to you straight between the eyes. Morley is your Crown Prince, isn't he? I thought so. Well, I'll see you around. - Cullen... - Don't deny it. I want you to know I sure feel sorry about all this. You know, the public is going to raise a storm. Cullen, listen. Now you know, some people are born to make news, some people are born to write. Listen. There's a bigger story in this if you'll string along just a little bit longer. There just ain't no bigger story. Is it a story if Ann Summers is found alive? That's big I'd say, yeah. You'll scare her off if you print that story. Believe me. Miss a couple of headlines column, for her sake, and I'll give you a call the moment she turns up. You know, doc, I think you're scared. I'm scared. Call my desk, they'll know where to find me. Where is he? Hello, Maria. Where have you been? I don't believe you have found him. I have found him. It's a trick. You are trying to trick me. If you believe that, why did you come back? I'm glad you're back, Maria. I will take you to him. What is this place? Rudi is here. He'll be here in a moment. Dr. Hamilton... Stay here. This is a fine time at night to be doing a thing like this. It brought her back, aren't you satisfied? Yeah, that's her, all right. - Did Cullen get here yet? - Yeah he's in the press room. Give me about three minutes, then bring Maria. Where can I take her? Right there, you can use my office. Where is he? Where is he? I'll bring him, but rest first, Maria. I will bring you Rudi. Sit here and wait for him. Maria, watch the light. Watch the light. Watch the light. Keep your eyes on the light. On the light. Your eyelids are closing. Slowly closing. it makes you sleepy. Sleepy. Sleep. Open your eyes. When you open your eyes, you will be at Mayerling. You will open your eyes and see the little angels painted on the walls. The crystal chandeliers with a hundred candles dancing. There is your music box. What is it playing, Maria? Our waltz. I will leave. The next person you will see will be the Crown Prince Rudolf. You will see only your Rudi. - Hello, doc, you did call? - Hello, Cullen. Just a second. Hello, doc, here he is. Hello, Morley. Morley. Morley. Morley. Who are you? I am Crown Prince Rudolf. All right, warden, would you take off the cuffs, please? You will do as you were told. You will walk through that door and you will find Maria. Oh, darling how much I have missed you! I have been followed. The Emperor sent Loschek after me. Well, now your father has a valet, a lackey spying for him. Oh, Rudi, you are so strong. It's so good to be in your arms again. Maria... But you never smile, Rudi, even when you kiss me, you never smile. I have been told never to see you again. Up to now we aren't such a scandal. Yes, things are going worse with my family. I know the Emperor hates me. But what can we do? This is the only way. No, Maria I would rather die with you than live without you. But I am only 18, so young to die. There is no other way. Loschek! I'm such a coward and I love you so. I must go first. Rudi! No, Rudi! Freeze your arm, Morley. You will now awaken, Morley. Morley, you are awake. Take him back! Ann... Blanks in the gun. The top of the whole thing is this: Hamilton had to use a real killer. Why? Because only a real murderer would have pulled that trigger, even under hypnosis. Ann, you will slowly awaken. You will forget everything that has happened in this room. Maria Vetsera is dead. Dead, Ann. You will awaken. You are coming awake. You feel refreshed. Awake. You are Ann Summers. Ann Summers.
