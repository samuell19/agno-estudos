Did you play the violin? No, but I would've loved it. I would like to quit after the concert. Quit? I am tired of the violin. I want to do judo like my friend Fanny. Judo? Not bad. - You practiced? - For hours. That's good, especially since you come only once a month. That's a lot. Giorgio, it's a real mystery, one of my former students, the most talented at that time, she would have a great future in this, but she didn't want to. We can finally get on with it. The mass is in 3 days. We don't have much time. His blood? Yeah. That's all we have. The Yugos tried this 4 years ago but failed. I paid a fortune for that shit. You had it analyzed? Twice. To learn that he's allergic to cat hair. We know nothing about him, except where he'll be Thursday night. In the VIP lounge. I don't know how you can eat that. Family secret of longevity. "A lemon a day, you'll live forever." A saying of my great-grandfather. Our Lord, in His immense mercy has given us a sacred gift: free will. Every human being, whether prince or beggar has the power to use it at will to understand and not to judge to love and not to condemn. This is the message of the Savior. Our name will be forgotten with time. We have him. 3rd row. 4th on the left. By normal practice, our guy will be the 13th one to receive the wafer. Our life is like a shadow. It is not eternal. Our days are numbered and will not return. I hope they don't switch places. They normally don't. What kind of poison? Slow acting and deadly. The heart will fail 6 hours after taken. Don't lick your fingers! They are proceeding faster. Got it. ...10, 11, 12. The body of Christ. Fuck, one missing! One missing in the line. The guy is sleeping. Thank you. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. Amen. REQUIEM FOR A KILLER Our nearest platform is 350 nautical miles off the coast. The costs of transporting crude oil by tanker to our refinery in Aberdeen would come to £17 million a year. The construction of a pipeline running from the platform to the refinery will reduce by a factor of 5 the costs related to transports, stockage and maintenance. Geological survey showed that there's only one possible route for this pipeline. Any deviation from the initial line would put a serious strain on the operation, making it unprofitable. The only remaining obstacle now is a legal one. The court case we recently lost against Mr. Child deprives us of the right to purchase the last remaining parts of land. Without it, works cannot continue and have been postponed indefinitely. That's fine. Thank you. That'll be all. And all because of a few barrels of whiskey. This pipeline is a great opportunity for our shareholders, Reverend. British Oil cannot afford to let it go, especially things stand. We have to have that land at all costs. But how? All the official channels have failed and you just lost your final appeal against Child. You have "carte blanche," Reverend. Whatever it costs. Providing, of course, that Alexander Child's death passes for an accident. I grant you, you have always done an impeccable job. Your reputation remains unblemished, the best on the market. But allow me to say, your rates are getting outrageous. Your employer can afford it. Your know Lucrèce is the best for the job. I'll get the amount you ask for. But at this price, it better be flawlessness. Seymour, it's been a while. She is not going to leave you alone. I am disappointed, Rico. 10 years ago you might have been someone. 10 years ago you would have come alone. You look bad, Rico. This is not from your 2 years on the run? That should have been a piece of cake for a professional that was in the service. Just not enough sleep, colonel, that's all. I see. 10 years in the field, impeccable field service record. The best track record of the entire organization. Why lost it? I didn't lose it. Insubordination, inciting disobedience, assaulting a superior officer then flee. That's quite a rap sheet for an elite agent with nerves of steel. What happened 2 years ago is between me and Seymour. We don't see eye to eye. Why am I here, colonel? I was in the open all the time. Could have brought me in before. Why now? I reinstated you, Rico. We're back to zero, with a clean slate. But no nonsense this time. Are you kidding me? I hope! No. I quit. It's over. My daughter will be 8 years old. I want to tell her what I do. I'm tired of being a lying mother. I'm tired of lying to everyone. It is getting old. Lucrèce, I need this contract. This is a piece of cake for you with enough money for a lifetime. I ask you to postpone your retirement for couple weeks. That's not asking much. Do me one last favor. Promise me one thing. I'm listening. I want to know everything. Know what? What my mother never told me. Okay. But not before this contract is completed. Renseignements Généraux (≈ Special Branch / FBI) has been looking for him for 3 years. That's all we have on him: perfect execution. A real ghost, the most highly paid hit man on the market. His bloody trail stretches across Europe. Former ministers, industrialists, officers, no one is immune. We must get rid of him. Where do I look? Rev. Van Kummant. The biggest bastard with a white collar. He mediates assassination contracts in Europe. He is sort of an agent for hit men-for-hire. Alexander Child. Your target. He is Scottish. He will sing with you. Anna Krups, like the coffee machines, is your cover. You are a French-German mother. Everything is in there. The largest agency in Austria got you the role. They sold you as a young promising contralto. It's been so long. You'll do fine. It is not like I ask you to fly a helicopter. Singing, was your first job, after all. You're good at it. If you ever feel not up to it, just say you are holding back for the performance. If you get to Child first you don't even have to open your mouth. Alexander Child, 37, Scottish, opera singer. Van Kummantu is being paid a fortune for his head. We believe he has hired the killer. An unexpected opportunity to take him out. The contract specifies that Alexander Child must be eliminated during the production of Handel's Messiah that will be given in 2 weeks at the Ermeux Festival in Switzerland. You are going there tomorrow morning. Find out who wants to kill Child. I want this done inconspicuously. Mr. Ferrières? That's me. To whom do I have the honor? I'm just a simple music lover, a huge fan of your festival. You are a man of taste. I try, Mr. Ferrières. I try. The rehearsal at Ermeux for "Messiah" will start tomorrow? That's right. The young contralto who will sing for you there is someone who is dear to me. I would like you to keep me informed of all she does and her whereabouts. She is handling a delicate matter for me. I need to know that everything goes as planned. You are in the ideal position to do that. Are you kidding me? No. Unfortunately, my son. This is out of the question. I understand your difficult situation, Mr. Ferrières. You lost a lot in the collapse of the stock market. According to your banks, your losses are around a million EUR. It's bankruptcy. Think of your festival, your castle, your parents currently on vacation in Sicily. Do us this small favor and everything will continue as before. Historic paintings. The 18th floor. Anna, We are in the Hall of Lords. Lords whereof, no one ever knew. Vittorio's room. Our tenor. The door locks are original and we don't have the keys. Don't worry. There has never been any stealing. We are in Switzerland. The room of Alexander. On bass, a beautiful voice. That's Olga, currently singing in Berlin and will join us at the end of the rehearsals. Finally, your room. Thank you. The 1st level is buried under the castle. The acoustics is perfect. The musicians will arrive this afternoon. Rehearsal starts at 3 p.m. - Please feel at home, Anna. - Thank you. Be on time. The conductor is French and obnoxious. That may be related. Please proceed. Bass: ♪ ♪ Why do the nations so furiously rage together, ♪ ♪ and why do the people, and why do the people ♪ ♪ imagine a vain thing? ♪ ♪ Why do the nations - - -... ♪ ♪ so furiously rage together, so furiously rage together, ♪ ♪ and why do the people imagine a vain thing? ♪ My great-grandfather Bartolomeo Biamonte sang for Giuseppe Verdi in Rome 150 years ago. His son was a tenor. His grandson too. My father was a tenor and I became a tenor. It's in the blood. We Biamonte, been performing Othello and Don Carlos for 5 generations. This is the way it is. This is stronger than us. My son Guido-- no. Prefers football. He's different. So, Mr. Conductor, your opinion on the participants. - Nothing special. Worse than last year. - You are too critical. The singers are excellent. The bass, may be. The tenor, yes, if he stops bellowing. The contralto, we won't know until we hear her. She has not sung yet. Huh, why? Congestion because of the altitude. Says the body needs time to get used to. She must be ready for the premiere. Yes, the premiere. Congratulations for earlier. Thank you. Impressive for a 1st rehearsal. It was nothing. I sang "Messiah" many times before. It is still very nice. Your voice is okay? I hope so. It has been a few days. I'll be ready for the premiere. To the premiere. To the premiere. Champagne? Champagne. I don't normally drink champagne but this is from Austria. - But, that's that. - Thank you. You're the guitarist? That's right. This is where it begins. The barley fields that'll be replanted. The stills. The distillery. Everything is yours? I just bought them. - They were going to tear it down. - That must be for a fortune? 15 years of savings, inheritance and bank loans. I put in everything I had. Wow. You must like getting froze in the Highlands. My father worked 37 years in this distillery. He lost his job when it closed. Hey! What are you doing? I had the wrong door. I drank a bit too much. I messed up. The door was opened. I got in. I watched you sleep. I confess. But that's it. I'm leaving. - How did you get the part? - What? You are hurting me. How did you get the part? Hartmann Agency got me the part. That's my agent in Vienna. Who in Hartmann? It hurts! Who in Hartmann? Spielmeyer takes care of me. Why didn't you sing? I don't buy the altitude excuse for a second. I am having an operation in a month, nodules (lumps), on both vocal cords. It's only a small chance that I'll be able to sing again. Is it wrong to want to be here one last time? There. Shit, are you kidding me? The only thing we ask you to do is to keep an eye on her. This is crazy. What if she sees me? She must not see you. It is important for your safety. I think I can help you. Vocal cord nodules can be circumvented. Try to resonate higher tone. After that, you would be able to sing even with a cold. That'll help you to keep up till the end here. It's worth the try? Chorus: ♪ Surely He hath borne our griefs,... ♪ It's wild boars. There is an old rifle in the workshop. Get rid of these beasts for me. "Developmental handicap" "Work integration program - Ermeux Castle." No, I quit. I am coming home. Find another guitarist. Sort this out yourselves. I am coming home. This is too much for me. Rico, nobody goes home until the job is done. Is that clear? I left this line of work. You put me back in the saddle. I am getting out with or without your permission. Without my consent, you're going to get 5 years for this shenanigan. This time, behind bars. Chorus: ♪ Hallelujah, Hallelujah... Hallelujah... ♪ You saw Ottmar? Have you seen him? I know. It is habitual. He ran away again. Yes. Yes, we have a contract to hire people from your agency, so? You are pissing me off! The premiere is in a week, I need a full crew. Right, when Ottmar gets back, tell him he is no longer needed. I'll find someone else for the festival. Chorus: ♪ Hallelujah, Hallelujah... Hallelujah... ♪ What do I do? As usual. But you'll be by yourself. Your mini synthesizer. All singers have one. You can take it with you anywhere. Inhalation, ingestion. Lethal even with tiny doses. And, antidote. How are you, how's your voice? It's getting better slowly. I prefer not to risk it yet. - I'll be in shape for the premiere. - That's what matters. Would it bothers your throat to have some wine? Not at all. The 2000 vintage is different. More open. [Refers to a wine with softer or fleshier tannins] Gentlemen, you are just in time. Thank you. Thank you. - For you. - Thanks. Anna, gentlemen, ... - ...to Messiah. - To Messiah. - To Messiah. - To Messiah. There's a slight bitterness. - A bit unpleasant. - Are you sure? May I? That's strange. Yes Must be a spoiled bottle. I'll open another one. It would be more enjoyable to have some food with it. I can't drink without eating. You are definitely right. Let's go sit at the table. Sorry. May I have an impulsive request, Mr. Director? My pleasure. I have never drunk wine from my birth year. I'll have to ask you what's your age. I was born in 1982. Wonderful year. I am all for it. You are in luck. I still have a bottle. Anna, to your year of birth. Salute! Cheers! All right, Miss? Fine. I'd like to invite you for lunch. It is beautiful outside. I am meeting Alex in 15 minutes. I already had a snack. - Well, too bad. Next time? - Next time. Good day. I can't do it. Too much pressure. I quit. I'll tell Ferrières. Let him get a replacement. Hang in there. You'll get there. What you did with me, it was great. I won't be able to get away with it throughout the performance. With the reduced arrangement, you only have to perform in 3 pieces. It's not like the Wagner concert. You can rest during the intermission and be good to go again, I'm sure. It's too risky. We'll rehearse every day until the premiere. There is no risk. I swear. Contralto: ♪ But who may abide the day of His coming, ♪ ♪ and who shall stand when He appeareth? ♪ ♪ Who shall stand when He appeareth? ♪ ♪ But who may abide, but who may abide the day of His coming... ♪ This is a geisha trick. It is imperative that the target is asleep. There, you push this fast and deep to the eardrum. Slightly upward towards the brain. It pierces the nerve centers. It leaves no trace. The bartender downstairs is crazy. Glenfiddich, 40 years old. You would not want to miss this? Good evening, Rico. Good evening. Oh, shit. I'm sorry. It's OK. I'm coming. What a shame. Things seemed so committed. The premiere is in 3 days. There's still time. It's too late. Because of the lack of results, my clients have changed their minds. "Changed their minds"? I used all my influence, but you have blown this. The decision is final. And Lucrèce? Her ambiguous relationship with the target is a problem. My clients are afraid that she has known too much already. That has to be professional. I can't sleep at night in the mountains. We think we can sleep outdoors and ruminate. Actually we toss and turn all night. This is all because of the altitude. It is a funny job. I mean, you and me. Always moving around. Never the same story, never the same people. No attachment. Lies. Mostly lies. To the family, friends, to everyone, actually. Take my dad, for 20 years, he thought I was a mechanic. It sucks. What do you tell your family, feed them craps? What do you tell your grandmother at Christmas when she asked "How are you?" When she asks "Why are you still not married at your age?" What do you tell her? That you kill people for money? It is difficult to have a family with all these? Not manageable? You tell her that? Of course not. You tell her that your job is fine and you are making money. So she smiled, happy, reassured. Enough for her to keep until next year. That gives you time to come up with other stupid excuses. That's for sure. It is not an easy job. Nothing better happen to Alexander. You know what I am talking. The soprano is stuck in Germany, a gardener is missing and the drummer is in the hospital? Too much is going on. He broke his hip falling into the orchestra pit! Clearly, you need to find someone to replace him. It is not like I have nothing else to do. You have only one more rehearsal with Olga. - That's not enough! - But it is. Anna? This is a disaster. Your agent is here. He should be at the airport. - My agent? I have not seen Hartmann in 8 years of the festival and now they are sending Spielmeyer just before the premiere. We don't have enough workers. The choir is not ready, it is too early. They don't care about me. Mr. Spielmeyer! Hello. Mr. Ferrières, director of the festival. Mr. Spielmeyer, my agent. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. You have a good trip? Yes, thank you. - Hello, Anna. - Hello. It's a pleasure to have you. Please enjoy the castle. Please take my luggage. I'll see my room later. Of course. It has been delayed because nothing went as planned. I'll catch up. I have time. OK, Lucrèce, I'm going to tell you straight. They cancelled our contract. What? You've been here two weeks and the premiere is in 2 days. We got fired. They put another assassin on the job, with a new contract. Besides Alexander, you are on the list too. That's why I'm here. We have to get out of the way. We need to hide until this is over. We are leaving tomorrow morning. Until then, I'm going to find out whom we are dealing with. Ludovic Blin, our chief conductor. Mr. Spielmeyer, Anna's agent. Nice To Meet You. I should have spoken well of Anna but no one has heard her sing yet. Don't worry. She'll be at her best for the premiere. I hope. Seafood in the land of fondue, that's nice! Excellent idea, Mr. Child. Thank you for the Chablis. I have been told that you are going to take over a distillery in Scotland. You are well informed. It is very pretty in Scotland. How's the deal? You already own the place? Yes, I own the place after a long legal battle. The stills will start running in September. You have time to sing? No, I won't. Will you stop? This is the last time. If you want to sing again, I'm here. For Hartmann, of course. And for tonight? A pro would not strike until tomorrow. He will need time to prepare everything. And tomorrow, we will be far away. This is our first failure. I would like to find that bastard who replaces us. But tomorrow, we are leaving at dawn. - Okay. Until tomorrow. - Tomorrow. I am worn. I haven't slept all night. I can use a nap. But first, you need to talk. I want a complete rundown on your killer buddy. The new one. Everything you know. I'm listening. I know nothing about the new... Otherwise, I would have already dealt with it. Who are you? A cop? That's right. How did you know? We knew there's a contract out on the Scot. We came to see. We have nothing on you. What do you want? Bust the guy who replaces you. I am ready to leave you alone since you are out of the game. But I can use a helping hand to catch the bastard. You know better what the killer may do. You need us. I have loads of data on you and your partner. Details, photos, fingerprints, DNA, the whole work. I already mailed them. It'll be on my desk tomorrow. A phone call, a long absence, my colleagues would open the mail. That's normal, right? At the slightest mixed-up, I'll drown you in the pond. Did you decide to tell me everything on this contract? Why? Your buddy Rico is a cop. He came to bust you. It's nothing. I haven't done anything. He's watching you. I know. He had warned me. When are you going to tell me? I'm sorry. Sorry? You pissed me off, Lucrèce. We start over. Change of plan. What? The cop holds us by the balls. He'll let us go if we help catch this new guy. I hope. If you could come out of this mess, it would be like Christmas. Who is the conductor? A Frenchman, very talented. He is very popular. A French conductor? They exist? - The director? - Hardly. The festival is his baby. He doesn't have time to kill. He has been at this for 8 years, I doubt it. The conductor? Same. Unlikely. A master of his craft in these circles for a long time. The soprano? She just arrived. It's tempting, but I don't think so. She is also a diva. There is the orchestra and the staff. - I've found nothing. - You did a lousy job searching. Him, that's Marco. Too cool for concern. Next, that's Katarina, the new drummer. She arrived yesterday to replace the one who fell into the pit. These are our primary suspects. That's the diva. I have to go. I got the profile on the German Katarina from the director. I told him the Hartmann agency is interested in her. She is not affiliated with any orchestra. She substitutions in Germany. This's the first time she works in Switzerland. Beautiful cover. Should look into this. You are going to take over? I'll try. [Private Number] New Message [Private Number] Truth at the chapel in the park. "This is Barbara Jones for Music One. Welcome to Ermeux's Lyric Festival." "Tonight, the 8th Opening Edition..." We'll find him. Don't worry. You would be safe with Rico on the stage and me in the back. - Alright? - Alright. I wonder what are we doing here. We are looking around. Do I have to explain to you again? Keep up with "Miss Timpani." I'm on the others. Today, we celebrate the opening of the 8th annual Festival of the Ermeux. Eight years of joy, fun, great pride. Thanks to you. Thanks to the artists. I considered cancelling the event this evening as the tragedy that affects us is deep and unbearable. But we all believe that is not what Alexander Child would want us to. Also, it is in his memory that the premiere of the "Messiah" by Handel will be presented tonight. The task for singer Tyler Edwards who agreed to join us gracefully will be difficult. Along with Anna Krups, Olga Babayova, and Vittorio Biamonte. "...it will, I'm sure, honor the one who is replaced" "and we miss him already." Thank you.

You've been here from the beginning. Did they have any other personnel change besides the drummer? Staff? A cook? A gardener. They had a gardener change. We stay in touch. The new gardener? The man who replaced... um Ur... Let me see. He came asked me for a ticket to the premiere. I could not refuse. I have no complaint. He had never seen an opera.

That's his picture in the forged document. He had not had the opportunity to use it. The guy was an idiot. A complete wacko. Anything with him would turn into a disaster. One time, he crashed a police checkpoint with his bicycle. I needed him for a job one time. I wasn't even 30 years old. I dreamed of something big. He went along with me. We robbed an armored truck. A risky deal. Of course, the whole thing went to shit. Guards opened fire. We panicked. I shot one of them. Your father was busted. I got away. He never snitched on me. The judge gave him 20 years. I never had the balls to bust him out. Six months in, he killed himself in his cell. You were not even 10. You've become my responsibility. Your mother ran away after your were born. That's why she never knew. He was buried in Aubervilliers. Go see him. He would have been pleased. There. Now you know everything. I don't know if it's better. Leaving again? For how long? Not long. Things will change. We will soon be able to spend more time together. You are tyring. Everybody is trying. Ms. Jacquet always says that. Who is Ms. Jacquet? She is my teacher. No, it is absolutely necessary to find her and get rid of her. No, it's out of the question. We cannot risk it! If my clients learn that she's still alive, it is a disaster. I do not want to know! Must be eliminated! And fast! Today, the group of British Oil presented their construction project to the press for a huge pipeline to link their North Sea platforms to their refinery in Scotland. The construction should take 4 years and cost several million pounds sterling. Lord Mulligan, the president of the group declared it to be a unique opportunity for our country.
