There we were cut off in the jungle. The entire regiment surrounded by the savage hordes Colonel Dougal MacDougal wounded "What shall we do?" He whispered to me. “Get a message to the relief column ” I said. "But who'll carry it?"he moaned "I'll carry it,Sir!" I cried! The night was dark, black as ink in a bottle. I took a revolver in each hand. And a knife in my teeth. Quietly I crawled across the rocky mount The jungle,that is. I was almost through the enemy lines When the moon,oh perfidious moon,the moon came out from the clouds "Here here,there there !" All about me the Zulus Bam, bam, bam! But how long could my ammunition last ? The guns were empty! I swashed with my knife! Corpses piles up and above me! But the Zulus still came! And then... Then?Then Then a sweet sight! Out of the dark of the night came running my great white charger I leaped on the back ! The Zulus gave chase ! Flights of poisoned spears darkened the air! I was wounded I clung to my horse Oh that magnificent animal. She carried me to the relief column. Fainting, bleeding,breathless I fell into their arms with my message The flag was saved! And you were a hero,grandpa? Well,they seem to think so When the Queen, God bless her, decorated me at Balmoral castle But grandpa, how did you get you big red nose? A poisoned spear a direct hit Oh,how wonderful, grandfather! "We are a hundred of pipers, we are a hundred of pipers" What day, laddie. What day. And there'll be others. It's you and me together, my boy,whatever the difficulties. Aye,we're in difficulties at this very moment It is a sin.It's a sin,I tell you! Letting the child fallen into the clutches of heathen!

Come into the parlor, and be seen by your grandma You are now in the hands of a good Christian woman. Come to your Grandma, Robert. Yes, grandma. What's this item? Sundry Do you think he can go to the academy in these rags? The laddie comes with no money. You're not suggesting I buy his clothes, are you? You are mercenary type fitted penny pinching man And if you were my own son I still much say it Your accounts are in a terrible disorder Here,boy,so sweetie. Suck, don't crunch,they last longer I'll run him up a suit with my own hands. Good. So,you've been seeing a bit of your grandfather Gow? Yes, grandma. And he'll be telling you great stories,I've no doubt Yes, all about how he used to sail the 7 seas. And the coast of Zanzibar. He told me about the Zulu war and how he got his big red nose. The Zulu war Didn't you know? It was hit him in the nose by a spear,a poison spear Oh,come along, Robert. We're going up to my room and I'll measure for your new suit,boy.

I want to sleep with grandpa His nightshirt is in my room! I'll provide him some with the night shirt Undress and get into bed. It's a thing or two,Robbie, you should know about your grandpa. The Zulus ... the coast of Zanzibar ... Heaven forbid I shall speak ill of a man But that man has never set foot 50 miles from Loganford Turn to the wall. Your grandpa,I must tell you Has cadged for pennies all his life Discharged from every situation he's ever held Grandma, I ... He is supported like yourself by the charity of my son Grandma So it was the Zulus who gave him his big red nose. Have you never heard of the drink? Never fear,my lad You're out of his clutches You'll live with me,you'll sleep with me. You'll go to prayer meetings with me We'll make you a God fearing man of you,Robbie.

Of course that means that we cannot touch the money now But Grandpa can't live forever But don't you think my father should have something to say about it? He's the one to pay the premiums With that little work he does for the lawyer,it's his policy Those few shillings he earns are hardly a proper payment for his bed and board - But - It's our policy -He’s right, Mama -We'll extend-Good You'll never regret that decision here is the application I made out, get the old man to sign I barely have time to catch my train. Oh, Adam ...

I don't know You can turn 50 pounds into 100 in 3 months Is it safe? Safe as the Bank of Scotland. Yes, but 50 pounds ... If you're not interested, Papa,there's plenty that are - I'll send you the money - Good Goodbye Mama Oh, Adam, we see you so seldom It's sad,isn't it? The little man.

He arrives here the very picture of that half trending ballad "The wearing of the green" still he doesn't know What do you know? I don't know anything,Sir You don't know anything Laddie,that's the first downright fruitful remark I've ever heard from the lips of a student Take your seat Open your reader For some years after Bannockburn, King Robert ruled Scotland wisely and well The war with England still went on, but it was the Scots who won the battles. At last King Robert became very ill He could no longer sit upon a horse and lead his soldiers to battle. Shannon. Bowl of porridge you're a problem You disturb me. You disturb my mind.

You must fight this Gavin Blair and you must lick him! No,I can't fight Gavin Blair! I could write the head master a letter Saying the boys are picking on little Robert Shannon He's a weakly boy and must be sheltered and protected No,don't do that,no! Well then...

So you didn't Got knocked down so many times, I don't even remember. I forgot everything you taught me. Granddad. It's obvious,you didn't run away by the look at that eye and this rag Good riddance Let this be a kind of mile stone in your life, Robbie. Let this fire put an end to the old And you look to the new Robbie laddie you can receive many of black eyes in this life. And if you are a man,you'll no be the loser You don't mean that I'm a man already ? Aye,I do,you are a man like your own grandpa Afraid of nothing! You can go your own way.

Get washed,Robert,you're going to a prayer meeting with me Where did you get that suit? Your eye,where did you get that eye? In a fight, grandma. What did do with the bonnie green the one I made you? I burned it. I do not think Mr Leckie would like to see it on her own,blood on it It was not very sanitary. Black eye or no black eye,you're going to prayer meeting with me No, grandma. This is your work,you beast of the field And another thing,I'd better sleep with grandpa from now on - What's that? - I a man now! You put him up to this! You heard the laddie say he is a man now In that case I don't think Mr Leckie would approve of sleeping in your bed. I've been expecting you, Robert Shannon. Gavin! Gavin! The golden plover And I've been hunting it all my life! It's yours. Find yours and keep this No, it's your collection. - But you found it -It's yours,Gavin. You are both serious!Take another egg. One from the nests. There are rules of nesting It's yours. If you don't take it, I'll ... Oh you two. Why can't you be practical? It's all these eggs Now,Gavin,you must swap him something Then the egg will be yours. - I Agree? - Agree. I've got just what you want On my secret handclasp. Oh, it's you. Aye. Hi there Robbie. What's that thing? It's a microscope. Aye? Walking along? - Aye - Aye Isn't it wonderful, grandpa? Gavin gave it to me As a man of science, I've ever seen a finer one Many time going out into the night microscope in hand to explore the mystery of the stars You're thinking of a telescope. We look at little things for the microscope. Oh There you are, grandpa There's a little bit of cheese for you to look at Just think, I've eaten that stuff all my life! May I have words with you, Papa? I'm a busy man. Observed with the fears of great moment The superintendent’s gallstones have taken a terrible turn for the worse Your papa is studying up I only wanted 15 shillings. 15... 15 shillings? He only wanted 15 shillings ... Robbie,what for? Not that important I mean,it's just something I need He wants 15 shillings for something that's not even important Are you out your senses? Please papa My burdens. My responsibility! Hear!Here I had to pay 21 shillings for an encyclopedia of sanitation! 50 pounds to Adam that I'll never see hide and hair of! There's your grandpa upstairs with an appetite like a growing boy And you ask me for 15 shillings. I need a new suit, everyone else will have them! Where,boy? My make up the First Communion. It's an outrage Robert, we've been tolerant. You'll admit that,won't you? We let you go your own way and attend the church of Rome without interference or reproach Oh Papa I'll have my say,I'm a liberal, tolerant man As you've seen well demonstrated. But liberty can go too far! And when it starts costing money than I'm against it 15 shillings! Robbie. I've just had the most shattering experience Did you ever look at a drop of water? All my life I've had an instinct about that stuff My instincts were right,look at it What is it, laddie? Would you say the microscope was worth 15 shillings? Laddie,laddie,you measure a thing like this in no engine,human life not insurance - What are you going to do? - I'll sell it! Papa won't give me a penny! I got to have a new suit for communion! Why laddie? This weezing is the key to the universe! This microscope could change your whole life! I don't want to see you selling it If I don't have a new suit don't you think that could change my life? I'm beginning to see. It's not just an article of clothe,ah? Well, you're not the first man to fight for his faith. Ah,things went brewing for a long time That's a queer sort of legacy your mother left you Why don't you go to the established church? And rowing with the rest of them Grandpa,I couldn't! Grandma would just love you for it. There is no sense taking the hard way. But I couldn't, grandpa. A boy should be where he is born to be If he had said anything else, I'd disowned you on the spot Believe me laddie,we best not sell the microscope. You have your faith, I have mine. Where are you going? I'm a sinful,irreverent man,Robbie. And I've little interest in the church of your choice But before I see you donning your new suit I'll burn the town of Loganford! I believe Mr. Leckie purchased this for 21 shillings. Aye,yesterday. Mr Leckie is most regretful, it is not comprehensive enough The encyclopedia is most comprehensive - Perhaps if Mr Leckie does not -Perhaps But he must have his money back I cannot be lowered than 17 shillings.It's been used. We accept 15 It's a matter of justice There was a tricycle. The tricycle fetched 15. Thank you I know I put it here. Well it must be somewhere! Oh dear,oh dear It's not every day I can afford to pay 21 shillings just for a book It's not in the bedroom,Papa I never knew it to fail I lose nothing except in my own house! Oh Robbie ... Have you seen Papa's Encyclopedia sanitation? He has not Robbie looked very nice for his communion. Now where did he get it? Please, please come to dinner. We made spaghetti. Be sure to come. I'm an old man. My life is almost over Here with the sunset in my face. It thrills me to see these young people marching on Let's drink to youth! To innocent,joyous youth! To Angela,to Robert. Who this day,unstained by the evils of the world,look to the future. Today I stood by Robert's side as he embraced his faith. May it please the Almighty I stand by his side as he enters manhood It is of considerable personal pleasure that I award this special medal in science. For once in my 11 years of the academy the last 3 as headmaster Not a single student has warranted this price Now at last Loganford possesses a scientist Who I profess will be some day a great doctor. Robert Shannon. Good work Green Breeches The Boswell history price to Gavin Blair. There will be no price in Literature this year. owing to a most unfortunate and widespread illiteracy among the geniuses you see before you However, the Academy takes profound pleasure in awarding The Queen Victoria diploma for music to Miss Alison Keith. Now may I pray your indulgence, as for a few words to those who are leaving Without music. Well clots What can I say to you? Very little You go forth now and Good luck to you. You'll need that luck but at least may I say that teaching is a dry and unrewarding occupation filled with drudgery and dull routine But now at last comes the moment You go forth And we,the masters go forth with you. In each of you a bit of us. And in your happiness and your success and your sorrow too We've find at last the fullness of our sweet reward Aye,and our sadness Good luck to you,clots God save our gracious King, Long live our noble King God save the King.

You're not included -Well,I don’t think I can,Gavin. -But the salmon is running! I'm going to work Monday. You mean you won't come fishing with me anymore?

There's your obligations,I suppose Aye Your Grandpa is getting old, and Mr. Leckie He's very good to you Aye He could have sent me to work at 14, and he didn't. The Leckies aren't rich,Alison.

All you need do is to sign this entry here Robbie... You must understand something well I've no had an easy time of it I've had burdens, disappointments Murdoch after all I spent his education, and works in a nursery.

I've been been taken advantage of,even Adam! Adam down in London a great successful man,he still owes me that 50 pounds,and it's almost 10 years He'll pay. Mama,I've made up my mind about that,I've no other recourse I'm going to pay my fare out of my own pocket And go down to London and collect that 50 pounds from Adam even if it takes the whole four-weeks of my holiday to do it We were speaking about the scholarship,Papa Don't interfere with me,Mama I've resolved,I'm going down to London next week There's nothing else to do You see how it is,Robbie? No,I don't Papa I let you go to school 3 years longer than the law demands!

Mr. Leckie,you've been my husband for over 30 years And I've scraped and pinched and I said nothing But you can go too far! You can't sell Robin's life With hopes for a few pennies from the boiler works I won't have it,I won't have it! Mama! Who's spoke of money?

You're reaching above your station in life and you reap not the disappointment No. No! I am no sign the paper Mr. Reid Mr. Reid! Sir, I ... What can I do for you?

And his eyes creeping like eels on the stone - We can do it -We can? Can we? Under that fool, Mr. Leckie's nose? I send Mr. Leckie away You will? I'll get him out of the house by next week. I might even send him to London. By Jove,if anybody could do it,I believe you could If we could just pull it off I can see their faces like a dark horse winning the Derby We can do it!

Work,work,work We can do it! Physics, chemistry ... - 6 hours of sleep only - We'll take 4 Let Robbie start with these until you get Mr. Leckie to London.

Yeah,not a smoker,here we are Put the things to the right -I can't believe it,Robbie. -You can I can't leave much money for food, because Papa thinks you're working. But Kate will help. I'll see that we don't come back until middle of August - Mama, who told you? - I don't know a thing I always say,what you don't know won't hurt you Robbie,just think I'll see the Tower of London!

But they are guided by rules,not justice Bowl of porridge,something else will be coming up You're young. I cannot worry about you permanently It's the measure in my faith in you laddie Here's a letter for you I picked it up at your house when I went there and found Mr Reid waiting It's from Gavin. Will you read it ? It's from Loch Inver "Dear Green Breeches, I just heard the news" "You could have picked a more fortunate time in my opinion,to come down with the flu". "I want to see you,I'll come home on the 9 o'clock 30" "I'll meet him at the station" Oh,there's no need You're not going out in the night air Oh no, I was meaning,Gavin never goes into the station. He hops off at the yards is closer to his house "If a man can't have a friend at a time like this , then what are friends for? " Yours Gavin. I am fine will he'd be feeling sorry for myself Gavin! Robbie! Why did this happen? There are so much I don't understand. I'm young I know Perhaps I have no right to understand. But Gavin was young You know how it is,a man got to understand something. You have your faith and then things happen out of no where and they make no sense A man got to understand something. Why? Why, why did this happen? Help me to understand. Help me. - Grandpa - Hey lassie Well,isn't that bonnie? I'll do my best Of course, a man with my background finds himself a wee bit limited with a tree of Mr Leckie's purchase Where is Robbie? He'll be here soon,what's up? Robbie's coming to the concert tonight,isn't he? Is it likely he'd miss it? As a matter of fact he's coming as my guest on his money. As a music lover of long standing,I never allow myself to miss a rendition of Hamlet's Messiah Handel's Messiah That's what I said. Grandpa,I wanted to see you before Robbie came on Aye There'll be a friend of mother's a singing teacher coming to the concert tonight If he likes my voice,mother will insist I go to the Academy of Music If I'm good enough I've always been afraid I was good enough. I don't want to go away and study. I don't want to leave Robbie. You'd come back,lassie Oh I come back But he's the one to should be studying and not me. He's the one with a gift,one that matters Oh, grandpa,what a doctor he could be! When I think of him down at that boiler works If you've the voice,you'll go to Winton. There's things,lassie,that no man can stop Like storms of the sea Sun through the clouds. Bad or good,you cannot stop them But what about Robbie? Let him enjoy the singing,don't tell him until the concert is done Here's Robbie now Perhaps you'll make such an eternal mess of it that there'll be nothing to worry about Alison ... Well about time,I've got to run. You're supposed to wish me well for tonight I was coming to you house when I cleaned up a bit You saved me a trip Would you turn your back like a decent citizen and stop your ever lasting nosiness I got to wash,you go and trim your whiskers Here's she's left it for your buttonhole. It's a bonnie night -It's a bonnie bridge -Aye - Robbie, I .. - You needn't say anything. Grandpa told me,you're going away Just to Winton You'll go further than Winton Oh no... I heard you singing tonight Then I'll not go to the Academy of Music You must. Say it,Robbie,say the word, ask me to marry you. Oh, Alison What do I care about the singing What good is the singing if there's nothing to sing about? Say it, Robbie I can't How could I,Alison? Do you love me or don't you? If you love me then as carry on You don't know what you're saying. Look at my hands. Are they the doctor's hands? What do I care about that What I'll be doing for you if I married you? I know my place. Whether I am suited or not, whether I chose it or not I've a place at the boiler works, and I'll not share it with you Alison ... If I loved you less, I might speak differently. We're young,I suppose we'll get over it I maybe young,Robbie I'm likewise tired. Will you take me home? Well? I'm looking for a Professor Ruttree. He's not here,he's gone to London for holidays. My name is Blakely. Can I help you? Well... Well,yes Sir,you can tell me, I want to study medicine. I haven't the money,but I'll work I'll do anything I brought my collection. - Oh? - Would you look at it,Sir? Yes... I've got the ability,professor. I collected some of these specimen when I was 9 years old It's an amateur collection I know Look at this paleocence hydra. Hm And look at this,this one it's a fresh water desmed It's so rare it's never been classified. - Would you slip into your microscope? - Yes... I can do the work,professor. You can tell by the slides I've fair hand You'll admit that they are not bad. Not bad at all I used to have a collection like this, myself when I was at your age Thank you, thank you, professor. Would you tell me? Could I get some kind of a job? I'll do anything, I'll be a laboratory assistant I am a laboratory assistant I'm not a professor Well,maybe I didn't mean laboratory assistant Just you have a lab boy perhaps Johnson I think there's some purple dye in the stock room Would you be a good fellow and just Johnson is my lab boy He probably thought that he'll be another Pasteur You may take my advice or not, as you please. There's no backdoor to medicine,my boy. And without money and a University degree, the front door is shut in your face I wish I could tell you otherwise Robert Shannon I've always done all I could for her You always done what you could for her A body can't stand that so much wear and tear Worn out, that's what she is Worn out! There's nothing I can do to save her. It's in Gods hands now. I doubted my Redeemer,forgive me. Why not punish me. Not Mama She never doubted. Oh,what fun did she ever have? None at all hardly Intercede for her Let her live and have some peace I ask you. I make this bargain Let her live and I'll never doubt again Never. I heard Mrs Leckie was ill - She's dead - God rest her Can I help you laddie? Careful,Shannon. I'm weary of medals This maybe God's way of testing you. Show you the way you must go What way? You'd do the priesthood, my son. God didn't want me to be a scientist it's too late to oblige him by being a priest There are many branches in the priesthood, lad. You want to be a doctor. The mind is father of many ears As a champion of the truth, you cure the body as well as the soul. I've no desire to serve God or man. It's too late. It's never too late to turn to God. I don't believe in God anymore! But God believes in you,Shannon. You're late - Am I? - Aye,you're late. It doesn't done for my old age, I must care for a house full of men. You come late to meals likewise Where's Murdoch? Murdoch is late too,I suppose We'll eat And that old man upstairs,what of him? - I'll take him his tray - You'll not I gave him his orders yesterday He'll eat downstairs with the rest of us, like a civilized,God-fearing man. Or he won't eat Oh Heavenly Father We thank you for all the blessing you supply to this motherless household Amen. Sit down, farmer. Where's grandpa? He is in his room Are you sure? It was found floating on the common's pond. They found his coat by the footbridge. When did you see him last? I don't know, Murdoch. The man avoids me. That sinful, insufferable beast of the field! He's off drinking again! His bed has not been slept in The common's pond did you say? Murdoch, is it possible ... I say anything is possible, the way he's been treated lately. But when grandma nagging him night and day and you threatened to send him to the workhouse. What? Papa wouldn't do that. And what would you know about it? When have you been home lately except for sleep or eat I support with my pay as keep, papa has got no right ... You pay the keep and that's about all You treat him like a stranger like you treat everybody lately, since Alison went away I've been stunned with your Mum, but he stood in need of discipline! Murdoch, do you think he ... I was just about to say that ... He's been out to the nursery a good bit He was been looking forward to the flower show and fair And you'd think my carnations were his own. He's got the gold medal at the flower show one already I don't know You don't,well I do! He's off drinking! He could have an accident,Mother The first thing we must wire for Adam. Adam was just devoted to the old man! Poor old fellow I'm mighty glad to see you, Robbie. - So you came - No signs No. I've looked everywhere He was a fine man, Robbie. We're hoping grandpa is still alive, Adam. Hope brings eternal in the human breath There's Mr McKellar now Oh, have you heard the latest? Mr. Parkins,who keeps the boathouse. Heard a distinct splash on Wednesday night. -Mrs Bosomley,have some tea. - I can't Oh, Robbie ,how my heart brakes for him I was just saying a finer man never breathed He had his faults A weaknesses or two? But what's that? It's only human Now that's Mr. McKellar. Come and sit down,Mrs. Bosomley. Ah, his great and good friends Come on in,gentlemen. We've want you to know we sympathize with you We'll miss Dandy. He was a good friend. - And good company. - That's what I'm thinking Why don't you say what you are really thinking And he's worth more to you dead than alive I'm shocked for you, Robbie! Where's your manners? Oh,Mr McKellar,come in,Sir,come in. The police would like to speak to you. - The Police? - Did they find his body in the pond? They found him In jail Grandpa Grandpa! Mr. Gow, you're intoxicated! Thank you,laddie Aye,it could stand re blocking Anybody,anybody coming through the rye Anybody is a body and everybody cry Each laddie has a lassie may they All the lassies smile at me when coming through the rye Come on, Robbie! If everybody coming through the rye ... In a word kiss the body anybody cried Every laddie has a lassie they may say hey Are you awake? Who what? Oh, aye,aye Don't take it Doctor's orders What? Can't you content yourself with beating me to death much as same with that poison man I've been taken that stuff for two weeks I'll tell you Robbie, it's too thick for my blood. Come on now No,no,no,Robbie. Let's inspect the situation like two reasonable men Now you'll admit a babe can't be weaned overnight Nor can a man at my age change the type of his liquid marriage within a moment If that foul liquid that you hold before me. Could just be changed into let us say, a wee drop of whiskey What's this? They all will be wearing tartans Do you think you're going to leave this house and go to the flower show and fair? When did I ever missed it? Never in my life! It's my duty, Robbie! How could the Loganford fair proceed without the attendances of the head of the Gow clan properly clad in the Gow tartan But this is a McDoon tartan Aye,my grandmother was a McDoon. A step sister was at least Grandpa It wasn't me who laid down rules to you ,it was Dr Galbraith You're to stay in bed. Do you know what he said? One more spur like the last one, and you'll meet your maker! That'll be an embarrassing meeting,for the both of us You've got to keep off the whiskey, grandpa I swear to you Robbie on my honor as a gentleman I can go to the fair and no touch this stuff Well,not had a drop in weeks! I'll stay home,grandpa Go on, go on,and enjoy yourself No,no I'll keep you company,I won't go You stay in this house, and I'll never speak to you Go on,go on Leave me here to die Here you go Papa Off you go,driver Oh yield that the high road and I'll dug the low road Is that Mr Gow? He's here contrary to my explicit instructions Let him stay,Papa I'll look after him. We're doing fine Robbie, we'd just won that one 40 feet and 3 inches! - A puny toss - The best of the day! Aye,it's obviously, young folks aren't what they used to be Aye,aye I remember at the Balmoral Games I tossed the gable so far it took all day to find it How the lassies smiled On more puny toss,and I'll have the mind to show them Grandpa, grandpa ... Alison! Wait here. Don't you stay unput! I'll stay like a rock. We were a hundred of us pipers, there were a hundred of us pipers ... Alison! - Robbie - Alison What are you doing away from Winton? If you'd answered my letters, you'd know more about me. Well,anyway I'm glad you're back But only for the day. I couldn't miss the fair. Alison, where can I see you in a few minutes? I'll be here. There were a hundred of us pipers, there were a hundred of us pipers ... Robbie, we were just looking for you. Aye I was looking for you. - Alison is here. - Aye? Could I trust you for a few minutes ? Aye Laddie,for eternity! Grandpa,how do you do it? Do what? I'm 18 years old,compared to you,I'm an old man. How do you do it,Grandpa,I like to know You're in the green years, Robbie. You suffer the critical disease of being young The Lord deliver me for me for having to go to that again Go on,find your lassie. I'll no budge an inch. Murdoch. Keep an eye on him. I'm trusting you,grandpa Murdoch. I'm trusting you,Grandpa Beautiful All come over here, they are all OK! They are all coming! All come here! Come on,try your strength! The winner will win a cigar! Better luck next time Mr! Come on Sir, win a cigar! Show what you're made of! Show your strength! Come on, grandpa! Show us! Disperse, let him get up! Take the hammer in your hands! Come on, old man, come on! Hit it hard! Cigar You were wonderful It's grandpa,at the flower show Alison! - What is it? - It is his heart Don't let anybody move in. I'm going to get an ambulance. He came back just as they gave me the silver medal He shook my hand, he said he was proud. He started to pick a carnation He wanted it for his buttonhole. Thank you lassie He said God save the king lately And last I said Stay up,Robbie, Stay up for both of us. I've been expecting you, Robert Shannon. He was a man of many follies But he was incapable of meanness He never bargained with God. He did good things because he enjoyed doing them How do you think God wanders to my great grandfather ... Might forgive me? For having doubted It was a fine funeral. Expensive but tasty Just make yourself comfortable in that chair,Mr McKellar. How's the light? Good enough? Where is Robert? Somewhere about,this hardly concerns him. Here you are, Robbie. Mr. McKellar was just asking about you. We're about to take up the matter of the will. If you excuse me, I ... I want the entire family present. Now according to my figures The insurance comes to a matter of 658 pounds, 12 shillings and 6 pence. In round numbers Exactly. 658 pounds, 12 shillings and 6 pence ... We must say it, Papa, he was a fine man. Oh,aye Sit down. You respected him before he died, you might stay and respect him now We'll read the will. There's no need,we all know what it's in it The formality of the occasion It's a very simple document. He left all he possessed,the insurance that is to your late wife. And in the event of her death - to her executor,yourself That's proper There's a codicil however The codicil was drawn shortly after Robert Shannon failed his examinations for the University Dandy Gow ,I called him Dandy. He was my friend, I hope. Left everything he possessed to Robert Shannon. He was insane! He was as sane as I am. He couldn't, it's not legal! It is as legal as the crown. It's a fraud! I 'll take it to the Law, I'll take it to the Law! Take it to Law Yes,do so,I may promise you I'll fight you in county court I'll fight you in the high court I'll fight you to the floor of parliament itself It was Dandy Gow's hope, Robert That you'd spend the sum wisely on your education. But I seemed to mind him saying sort of afterthought it was If you prefer to invest it in wine, women and song,that's your privilege That man! That man! Subtitles by Nostromo
