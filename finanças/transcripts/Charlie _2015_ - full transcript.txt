Goddess Earth. I have started this work with a belief in you. Even if I commit a mistake bless me with sufficient food, Goddess. Greetings to all the viewers. You left all your worries and have come here to listen to my story. And it is my duty to make you happy by telling a story. Many years ago there was someone called Cheluvanarayana Swamy in Melukote. He was a painter in Mysore Palace. He was an amazing artist. His wife, who was an excellent Veena player, passed away. They had a son. Things went on, and when India got independence the king gave him a pasture in Bengaluru as he didn't know what else to give him as a gift. Cheluvanarayana Swamy's family came to Bengaluru built a house in the land provided and lived there. There were no signs of improvement in his son's behaviour. As time passed, his son became more mischievous. Fearing that things would get out of hand if this continued his father got him married. But still the son didn't mend his ways. And Mr. Cheluvanarayana Swamy passed away. Many years after his death his daughter-in-law gave birth to a child. And the baby was named after his grandfather. The kid who was pampered by his parents didn't know the consequences of being named after his grandfather until he attended school. The kid, who was good at sports and studies had only one problem. He never liked people calling him by his grandfather's name. And he used to hate when girls called him by that name. One day, the kid, Cheluvanarayana Swamy saw something that he shouldn't have seen and he got inspired by it. And he changed his name from Cheluvanarayana Swamy to this.. 'CHARLIE' Time passed by, and Charlie's parents died. He grew up as an orphan. The city grew, and so did his tenements. Come, let's see his premises and the people who live there. "Why should we be afraid if we are in love?" "Loving someone is not a crime." "Why should we.." Sir, one minute. - Yes. Your name? - Jogi. Sita Lakshmi. Shankarappa Gunamukha. Suchitra. Prashanta. Mandakini. - What do you do? Why should I work at this age, mister? I am a progressive thinker and a writer. I own everything from T to IT. What do you think about the owner of this place? Him! He is a big fraud. He is an idiot.. Instead of working hard he keeps roaming around the city with a camera. He is Mr. Miracle. There is nothing special about him. He has got sharp eyes. He is very humble. His smile.. He is like an angel. No matter what problems the people here has to face he protects us all. His physical attributes pale in comparison to mine. Everyone here is dependent on him. He is He-Man. He is a perfect man. Listen to me carefully. Your owner has transferred this whole property to me. You'll have to leave this place in three days. Whom are you ordering to leave? Hey! Oh, no! Hey! Listen to me carefully. You have to vacate this place in three days. Or else.. I'll finish you off. Okay? Call him. "He stole a sari. He won Radha's heart." Hey.. You! You are too choosy, aren't you? You drink only mineral water, is it? Let me go, sir. Give me what I have asked for, sir. I won't sign even if you kill me. How can you sign if I kill you? Sign this and then you can die. Tell me. What is his problem? - Usual things. Let me talk to him. He might die if he hears your voice. Okay.. Don't take too much time over such trivial issues. Come soon. Sir. Why are you troubling me? Sign this. Will you take it with you when you die? Don't you want to share it with others? Why are you troubling him? - Hey. Hey! Let me settle this deal for you, sir. Give it here. Here you go, sir. You have so many properties. What would you lose if you give a small portion of it to him? Please give your autograph. Good boy. Here you go, sir. It's a done deal. Are you happy now? If you try to take over my premises I won't stay quiet. Where are you going? What is this, mister? How can you send such a strong guy against me? What is this? - Seena. Are you crazy? Hey, what? Hey, go and get sticks. - Okay, sir. My kidney is damaged! It's heart, not kidney. Hey! He is posing, man! Hit him.. Branded glasses. How was it? Forget what happened. You'll stay alive if you stay away from me and my land. Or else.. Get lost. Take care of your health. I love you. Bye. Don't worry about anything. I'll help you out. Greetings, sir. Why are you here? Prasanna is creating more problems. He doesn't care even if we take your name. Mister, I've told you I'll discuss your problem with the boss. Your problem will be.. - Karjola. Listen, mister. I don't talk much. Listen to what I say and understand what I didn't say. I have promised that you will never face any problem. I will keep my promise. - Okay. Okay, sir. Let me tell you something. These people know that I'll give them something if they come here. The day when I can help them no longer they will go to someone else. When I can no longer help other people that will be the end of me. You can leave. I'll take care of the rest. Okay. I'll take my leave of you. Hey! Act your age, man. You eat something that's fit to eat. It is better to chew than to suck. Get it straight. Hello. - Charlie. Your name is Charlie, too! Tell me. Prasanna here. Tell me, sir. Spit out what you have in your mind. Hey! You are crossing the limits. Nothing can stop me from doing what I want. Hey. Hey! Didn't your elders tell you not to stand in the path of a hurricane and not to fight with tigers? Hey, I won't stop until I fulfil my boss, Gangadhar's wish. Think about it. Gangadhar! - You'll pay for it. Hello.. Hey, talk to me. I mouthed off. I would have lost my life. Why are you crying? This is happening because of people like you. I have neither a job nor money. On top of that, I messed with those goons. I can't live in this city, pal. Since Veerappan's death Mahadeshwara Hills remain uninhabited. I'll go there and settle down. - Are you serious? Sir, what about my dhaba after you leave? Who will take care of my wife and children, sir? Get lost. I spent my youth taking care of others. What is it? Tell me. We will find a solution, sir. Dear. - Yes. My problem is bigger than what you can handle. Take a seat. Are you in love, sir? Don't you know that you shouldn't rub salt in someone's wounds? Sir, at your age it's normal to get into trouble with women. Age? At this age, I can handle even if it cold or raining. But I can't handle if a girl enters my life and betrays my love. Are you telling me to ruin my life? No matter how the life is. You should love it, sir. Look over there. They are so sad. Drink, dance, and enjoy with them, sir. "We have no idea what God wants. Our life is a confusion." "We have no idea what God wants. Our life is a confusion." "The problem of the youth is" "they see darkness even when there is moonlight."

Nightie for Rs. 90.. Cotton nightie.. Cotton nightie for Rs. 90. Nightie for Rs. 90. Cotton Nightie. Nightie for Rs. 90. Cotton Nightie.. Cotton nightie. Who is it hawking liquor in my area? It's not liquor, sir. I am selling nighties for women. Oh, it's nightie, not moonshine. What were you thinking? Look at the new items here. Where are you? Sir, I am in Sringeri as I have got some work. There is some work. Will you get it done? Sir, we are like the bell in a temple. People want my services free of cost. I have decided that I won't work for free. It's Karnataka Tourism. Less work and more money. Sir, we can't discuss this over the phone. Meet me, sit. Let's talk. Okay. Let's meet up in the pub. "Oh, Friend! I am yours, teach me how to love." "I have roamed the world, teach me how to love." "Oh Friend! I am yours, teach me how to love." Yes. - Mister. People say that girls are the reason that guys get spoiled. Look over there. Girls are drinking and getting spoilt. Isn't that wrong? We dance crazily at the temple carnival, you know. "You're there in the morning, you're there in the evening." "You are my friend, you are my beloved." "You're there in the morning, you're there in the evening." "You are my friend, you are my beloved." "Every time, every minute, all the day." Lighter, please. "..you are my beloved." "You're there in the morning.." Hey.. - Hello. Hello, sir. Order, please. Mister, what are those girls drinking? I can't tell you that, sir. That's confidential. Don't tell me. Just get me something other than what they are drinking. Isn't it shameful to drink and dance crazily? Sir, no comments. "I write on the slate.." Now, she will get it. "The world doesn't know.." "The world doesn't know" "whom my heart belongs to." "The world doesn't know whom my heart.." Friend. - Do you want it? - Yes. Can I ask you something? "The world doesn't know who my heart belongs to." What a horrible day I have had! - "He stole a sari.." Hello. - I'm in the basement. Where are you? I.. I'll come. You stay there. Okay. Come. Tell me. What is this? How can you leave a bar without drinking? Greetings, sir. I just fled as I couldn't handle them. Here you go. You have to go to Hampi. Go and get the work done. It's pure. It's unadulterated. You can trust them. - Okay. Hey. I'll send the money tomorrow. You can leave. Isn't it wrong to do this business without informing our boss? I feel this is risky. It's isn't wrong. He is an old-fashioned man. Neither will he do nor will he let us do. That old fox refuses to help us do any other business. Sir, but without his knowledge.. Hey! Listen. Now there are many new opportunities to make money. We want money. - You are right. And kids who have money want these things. That old man won't understand all this. You guys tried to trouble me. I'll teach you a lesson. Hey, you idiot. Where were you watching? Are you blind? Do you want to die? Can't you switch on the light.. You are annoying me. I don't want to see you around. I'll make you suffer. Get lost. Darn! Hey.. What a great physique! Is it genuine or fake? Who are you? Why are you barging in? Don't you want to live? I want to live, sir. My name is Charlie. - Okay. I own the premises which you want to be vacated. Where is that property? - It's in Chamrajpet. Sir, you own such a huge palace. Why do you want my small land? Who asked you to vacate? Someone called Prasanna. Your right hand. Right hand? Prasanna. Prasanna! Talk to me. - Sir. Is this true? I am in trouble, and you are joking, sir. Listen. I know someone called Prasanna. But I didn't ask him to evict you. And I don't want the land that belongs to you. Don't worry. Leave. Thank you so much. Sir, why are you bulging? Hey! You should work out. You used to look quite masculine. I saw you when I was a kid, sir. Girls used to stare at you when you passed by. That was a long time ago. I was well built then. But not anymore. Karjola, help me. Come on, sir. You can't get old. You all are heroes. Disgusting. What is this, sir? Slippers and Lungi! Drat! Listen to me. If you wear a suit, new shoes, and dye your hair.. You will look great. Sir, once upon a time you were.. Hey! Stop it. I'll ask Prasanna not to trouble you. Got it? Leave. Thanks, sir. I'll take my leave of you. Hey! Keep coming here. To pass the time, I guess. Sir, I forgot something important. Why is he back? Watch this, sir. - I don't watch all that. Leave. Watch it, sir. Karjola. Ask Prasanna to come here. Who is she? - Why is she here? What are you doing here? I am here to pay back the debt. Who are you? You hit me. But you don't even know who I am. Not that.. Anyone would have done the same looking at your actions. I'll live as I want. Who are you to question me? Go away. Her money, her life. Why should we bother? Why did you come looking for me and slap me? I didn't do it on purpose. Looking at you, anyone would feel like hitting you. Is it? - Yes. Forget it. I shouldn't have hit a girl. I'm sorry. Would you like to drink something? - Tea, coffee, juice. - Hey. It's your personal matter. I shouldn't ask. Why do you drink so much? What is wrong in drinking? You can do anything. Why should we be restrained? I didn't mean that. When I saw you that night it seemed you were not one of those kinds. What do you mean? - I mean.. You didn't seem like a person who drinks daily. Listen. I am one of that kind. I can't sleep if I don't drink. And that's my lifestyle. I believe what I see than what I hear. It's the same the other day. You are saying something, but your eyes express something else. It seems like you want to defy this society and the people. I don't know if it gives you happiness or not. Life is important. Think about it. No, that.. Is the boss inside? He asked me not to send anyone inside. He has called us. Let us go. Hey, stop.. You responded very quickly to his call. You are carrying a gun! Only two of you can come. Go, Prasanna. I think boss can't see things. You both go and meet him. What is this, sir? You changed a lot. People change. And you are shocked that I changed my attire. What's the need for this sudden change? Prasanna, you are making a lot of mistakes. I didn't do anything, sir. I know what you are doing using my name. You better stop that and do something good. Else.. What if we don't agree? You will have to leave this city. I didn't do anything as such, sir. Someone lied to you. Hey! I am not a fool to listen to others. How can we earn a living if I stop all my work? We'll get you a job at a diner. You can be a waiter and he can wash utensils. Was it a joke? What if we don't agree? Boss just said that he would throw you out of this city. Do it yourself. Do you know whom you are talking to? Not just you. Whoever gets into the business of peddling drugs I'll make them wear a sari and bangles. Mind it! Hey, idiot. Did you pack things? It's a long journey. Come on. Let me pack you in. Listen. Take this lid off. I am not able to remove it. I just had chicken. Can I touch this? I was just joking. Give it here. Tell me. You are leaving the city because you are scared of someone, you coward. You got it wrong. The one whom you called notorious left this city. You know what? His wife and children are crying day and night. So, I am going to get him back. Will you come with me? Do you ever speak anything reasonable? Anyway, be careful. Don't eat any junk food. Oh.. As if you cook for me daily. Anyway, bless me. Wish me luck. - May God bless you. Hello. Are you a local resident? - I am a womanly woman. Is there a hotel or a lodge nearby? Would I refuse if you ask me directly? Oh, my! Ma'am, you are misunderstanding me. Tell me if you know the route. Or else say no. I can find my way. Okay. Why do you get so angry? If you go straight, you'll find one. I have just arrived here. Don't jinx it. I think you are waiting for someone. Don't wait for long. - Okay. - Thank you. Who is it at this hour? Can I get a room? Can't you ask respectfully? This is how we usually ask. You don't let me sleep even at this hour. Come in.. Sir. Sir. What is it? He wants a room. Sir. Is it well-lit and ventilated? Is water available? Is that enough or do you want something else? I belong to a decent family. I don't want anything as such. Sir. - Yes. I hope the fan and lights here don't turn on or off automatically. Hope I don't hear the sound of someone's anklets or the noise of a squeaky bed next door. There is nothing as such. How long are you going to stay here? I'll leave when you ask me to. Okay. Go on. See you tomorrow. What is coming in between? What is it? - Money.. Why should I pay you? You took the picture of my wife. Hey, why did you marry this hill? Couldn't you find a girl? - Will you pay me or not? No. Get lost. Ladies. He is clicking your pictures without your permission. Find what he's up to. Ladies, you have misunderstood me. I took pictures of something else. Did you hear that? He was clicking something else. No! Hey, stop.. - Get lost, you fool. You crazy! Hit him.. Hey, can't you see? - Hey! How dare you? Where are you from? Where are you from? Bengaluru. What about you? Our village is this way. Is there a village this way? - Yes. Which village is that? Go and find it yourself. You spoiled brats! Did you see the village? People my age will either face trouble from old people or from kids. They are just small kids. How dare they hit me! I see. I'll teach them a lesson. Hey. My bag.. 'Kids are not allowed.' My life is ruined. Gayathri, do you know something? Mr. Venkatappa is looking for a bride for his son. Aunt. - What? Don't you want to get married? Stop it, Aunt. I want to study further. Tell my father. 'Come to me. I can get you into a university.' What's going on here? I took care of you till now. What are you plotting here? Didn't I tell you to go and work? Dad, I am scared to go there. You can roam around getting decked up. Can't you go and work? Hey! Get down. Go and work. What are you looking at? Go about your work. You wretches! Hey! Why are you still standing here? Go away. Get in and do your work. Or else, I'll make you suffer. Your ear.. Darn! Guys, I'll be back. Okay. Take your time. I think she liked this picture. Is it too expensive? Wow! This is your best picture. - Thank you, sir. Let me see its price. Sorry, this is not for sale. If it's not for sale, why are you exhibiting it? Give it to me, sir. I'll pay you double. I don't do everything for money. Relationships are important. We meet different people at different places. We should compromise according to their likes and preferences. But it is not right to have the same opinion about everyone. What are you saying? Who are you talking about? Sir, you won't understand this. I am for sale. Buy me. Mister, I got it. I hope you are sane. What a weird fellow! Poorna. I am not that smart. I don't understand what is right and what is not? Wouldn't I get scared if you try to talk to me in such a situation? Smart people should have understood. Isn't it? I'm sorry. She should have been here by now. Hi. I have named myself Charlie. I think her parents didn't name her. She is a silent girl. Mister. Thanks. My name is Gayathri. Where did you find this? That.. I found this in the stream. Thank you. - You are welcome. Hi. - Hi. What is the matter? You are clicking pictures here! I don't discriminate at all. I will capture anything that pleases my eyes and captivates my heart. You are too good with words. I am a bit confused that people like you exist. But still I feel like making friends with you. I'm your friend now. Won't you take me around your village? It's not a big deal. Let's go. What's special about your village? It'd take an entire day to tell you that. Shall I tell you what it is? What is it? It's you. - That's a lie. Don't you feel exhausted going to different villages and clicking pictures? I'm like a hardened traveller. I can adjust to everything. What a beautiful dream! Shall I fall in love with this beauty and spend my entire life with her? Is this true love? Yes. From this very moment my life belongs to her. "I don't want any song written by others." "Listen to the song I have written." "I am not a poet to say many things." "I will say what is in my heart." "You are my life." "You are the one." "You are the one." "You are the one." "I don't want any song written by others." "Listen to the song I have written." "The feelings in my heart keep increasing" "the more I write and express about them." "When you walked towards me" "it seemed as if a star reached the Earth." "It's the most precious moment." "You are an art and I am a plain paper." "I dedicate my life to you." "I jumped out of joy" "when I saw a gem in front of me." "It seems as if I have become rich." "I am the one." "I am the one." "This is my story." "Upon your order" "I will present my life" "in front of you." "My heart dances out of joy" "because of the happiness I feel" "when I walk with you." "See the result of your love." "I feel strange because of you today." "You are my love." "Like a dream" "you appeared in front of me." "How is this possible? What is this?" "How is this possible? What is this?" "The story.." Isn't it wonderful? Cumin is a bit less. Else it would've been amazing. I am talking about the sunset. I was talking about this snack. What is so special about sunset? It happens daily. I love it. What are you talking about? - The sun. What's wrong with your village? People don't like other people. One guy says he's married to a hill. And you love the sun. It's quite bizarre! Whenever I see the sunset I get philosophical thoughts. I also feel the same. But only at night. You can talk. You can see so many changes when the sun is about to set. Light, dusk, darkness. We can see everything. It would be so good if we could get rid of problems in our life so easily. Ma'am, there is just one sun. If it acts at your behest what about the world? I mean to say such a radiant person will come into my life one or the other day. Then I'll be happy. Happiness is not something you can expect. We should live in the moment. It sounds good to hear. It doesn't happen in real life. Why do you always act as if you have lost something? You should dream something positive. If all our dreams come true then we can dream. It is better to be quiet instead of thinking something unrealistic. Look at the sun. Sun knows that we are alive because of its light. But still it doesn't expect anything from us. It just rises, illuminates the whole world and by the time we start loving him he disappears. Did you ever try to stop the sun from setting? I mean.. What is your dream? I'll tell you some other day. I got a reason to meet you another day. Look at the sun. It's about to set. Look at it. Why are you dirtying this place? Go to sleep. It's time. What is the time? Watchman. I didn't ask for your watch. It's time to go to sleep. Go and sleep, dear. I can't sleep tonight. Why so, dear? I wish for something. But I'm not sure if it'll come true. You wish for it, right? It will come true. Now go. You are a crazy guy. What can I say! Why do you look so dull? I'm thinking about something. Tell me about it. Please. Please. - I am thinking of contesting the elections this year. Trust me. You'll lose. I know it. But I would like to give it a try. Good if I win. And it's okay if I don't. I think you are hiding something from me. It's you who's good at keeping secrets. I'm quite expressive. Won't you tell me? I am going back. When will you come back? - I don't know. Anyway, why should I come back? To see me and talk to me. Let me take your picture. I'll look at it whenever I remember you. Picture doesn't talk. I know how to make the picture talk. I'll talk to it. You are crazy. You realised at least now. Thank God. Another guy is trying to seek your hand in marriage. And you are hanging around with this scoundrel. Hey! You seem to be very angry! You haven't yet seen my anger. Is that so? Charlie! Dad! Get away.. Charlie.. Come and sit on my bike. Ma'am, do you have lemon rice? - Yes, we do. I like lemon rice. I'll order that for you as well. Take a seat. Two plates of lemon rice. Is your father really a human? He always indulges in violence. Isn't there anyone to guide him? Take your lemon rice! My mother passed away when I was too young. Later, my father remarried. My stepmother is very caring. She used to take care of me like her own daughter. But my father is not a good man. He grows cannabis on his farm. A person called Raghava comes from the city to collect the harvest. Hello, I like you a lot. He always misbehaved with me. I'm going to be your husband. I've every right to touch you! Be it my father, be it Raghava.. All the men in my village behave the same way! So, I never trusted anyone. That's when you entered my life. I couldn't stop myself from trusting you. Hereafter, you are my world. All right. You are praising me way too much. What if you come to my place! You would be surprised. Come on, eat. Oh! The auspicious time is running out, lazy people! Am I the only one to bother about things here! Your honour, this person, Cheluvanarayana Swamy lured an innocent girl with his sweet talk and abducted her! Ma'am, the girl is very pretty, isn't it? - Yes. She looks very graceful. You've come to this house for the first time. Place your right foot forward, dear. Oh, no! - Hey, come on now! Who are these people? They live a boring life. but my life is colourful. Come along! What are you still thinking? I became sick of my life. I don't know what the future holds. I'll ensure that you'll never cry again. Trust me. They won't come here to trouble us, right? Why are you so scared? God isn't that cruel. He'll show us a way out. It's got nothing to do with me. These are just the efforts of sincere officers like you. What I want is a clean city without such filth around! If you'd listened to me you wouldn't be going to prison now. Greetings! The professional clash between us is going to become personal from now on. Wait and watch the consequences. It is too much! It is too late! An old man here.. I mean, doesn't he fear an elderly man like me? Why isn't he home even after midnight? Will you please shut up? Doesn't it happen every day? I know! In case, if I was also not at home what would have happened to you both? What would've happened? Get lost! Madhubala! - You! Instead of lying on the bed and dreaming what are you doing here? Are you drunk today as well? What is new about that? Oh! Are you feeling bad because I didn't call you? Sorry! I am sorry. We'll drink together tomorrow. Is that okay? Hey, don't try to butter me up. Hey! Listen. - What? Forget how you were till now. Hereafter, you've got some responsibilities. Be serious! Don't forget to keep your promise. Get me a full bottle. Hey, beauty! Oh! A family drama is going on here! Are you trying to please her by feeding her? You are really smart! Hey, idiot! Why do you want to drink to death? Not everyone dies that way. Come on, tell me! Do all drunkards die? Hey! Just shut up and lie down. Else, I'll throw you out of the house! Hey, what did I say wrong? Answer me. Come, dear. - Do all drunkards die? Hello! Since women have started to drink no one respects drinking men anymore. "I lost.." Oh. Were you the one who was singing? - Yes, why? You sing really well, Gayathri. I thought I was dreaming. Do you really dream? Why? Can't I dream? I didn't mean that. Dreaming is just for the unlucky ones like me. Gayathri, in spite of having everything I have no one in life. Like everyone else even I wish to have a wife who sings morning prayers and have children playing around the house. I wish to go on a long drive with my family go to parks and the movies. That's all casual in a family, right? But I have no home. Then? What is this place? These are just mere walls, Gayathri. According to me, a home has a different meaning altogether. Then get married soon. That will give life to these walls and this will become a happy home. Hello, I am ready to marry. But someone should be ready to marry me, right? Oh, God! The girl who gets a husband like you would be the luckiest of all! You wouldn't have even noticed your girl even if she was beside you! Idiot! 'Beat the drums!' What's up, hero? Where were you all these days? What are you doing here? Knocking your door daily is like a new a job for me. Have you lost your old job? Hello! I didn't mean that. I wanted to thank you. - For what? You shouldn't ask the reasons for sorry, please and thank you. Philosophy! I'm really happy because of you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Hey.. Don't get confused! "How are you feeling now?" "What do you think?" "You're too hyper now." "I slipped and fell." Madhubala, how are you? Awesome! Sweet 69! What's up? Darling, you haven't paid the rent for the last three months. Pay it. Listen, I cannot pay you the rent for the next three months. - What? You don't have to come asking for it again. Open your mouth. Good boy! May God bless you. May you live longer than me. Ma'am, I don't want your blessings. I just want my rent. Hey, do you value money more than my blessings? You brute! Go to hell! Actually, I'll get my payment today evening. I'll prepare chicken curry for dinner. Come and have your supper here and collect your rent, okay? Really? Get lost! Hey, I know that nobody would pay you the rent this month as well. Keep this. - It's okay. I'll take it later. Just take it! Hey, rascal! Concentrate here. Drink some. Only if you get drunk you'll look handsome. No, Madhubala. A girl has entered my life. I should quit drinking. A girl? - Yes. So many girls entered my life. But did I ever stop drinking? Hey, don't talk too much! Drink it. - No. If you drink every day, you'll damage your kidneys, you know. Hey, you'll also damage your clothes if you wear them every day. For that matter, will you stop wearing them? Wow! Even though your hair has started falling your brains are intact! You are really smart! Madhubala, on that note tell me how to please Gayathri. Firstly, you need to drink. - What? - Yes. - Done! To make your brains work to make your body move to make your mood perfect you should definitely drink! Hey, get up! I'm not finished yet. Get up. I almost said everything. I was about to say that if you drank more, you'd lose your senses. But you're already knocked out! I am going out. Take care of the house. I'll be back with some good news. - Hey.. Hey.. - Hey! Both Sugar and Salt hand-in-hand! What did you mean? You'd been coming here alone all these days and used to pester me to come with you. You've got company now. Come here. Did the priest do something? Mind your tongue! Do you think everyone is like you? Hello! What do you think of me? I have one life, one girl, only one love! Got it? You won't understand! Go away. Gayathri. - Yes? I've paid your college fees. Go and join on an auspicious day. Okay. Can you please find a hostel for me? What for? You can stay at my house. Even I wish so. But what will people think? I don't want you to get a bad image because of me. Nobody would think as such. She is right. Anyway, she'll be in this city itself. We can go and visit her once in a while. You want to stay in a hostel. - Yes. I'll arrange for it. - Okay. Come, let's go. Hello! This isn't public transit. Take an auto rickshaw. Take this. I've bought you new clothes. Here you go. - Thank you. See you. Auto! The changes that happened in the life of our reckless hero were because of a girl who entered his life. Look at this. This boy is surprised to know that such innocent girls who fall at the feet of men exist even in these days. And the girl wondered if he was such a great soul to receive such a gesture. And our hero who is unbothered about everything else finds happiness by making others happy. Go on. Hello, pretty lady! Greetings. Look at her. She doesn't even have the courtesy to wish back. Why does she even come to college dressed up in such colourful clothes.. Damn! - Hello! In front of me you guys are teasing a beautiful and innocent girl. I won't let it happen! I'll give you three seconds. If you don't leave this place by then, I'll show you! Shucks! Our plan was a flop! Idiot! Will you people never mend your ways? What do you think of girls? Hello! Darn! It's the result of seeing your face early in the morning! Why do you get so scared? If you keep tolerating all this those hooligans will never stop pestering you. Be bold! Look at me. If at all someone teases me I'll just punch their face! Sorry.. Let's be friends. I am Punarvasu. I mean, Purvi. I am Gayathri. I just hate to see my friends worried. All my friends should be happy. So, smile! Well, why did you touch Charlie's feet the other day? He is my world now. He is the reason I'm here today. By the way, how do you know him? Wherever good people exist I find them and make friends with them. I thought I was utterly shameless before meeting you. Now, I realise there's still some honour left in me. Hey, are you done with your gimmicks? No.. I am here to apologise. I was the one who set up the ragging. It was a mistake. Please forgive me. Else, I'll beat myself with my sandals. One is not enough for you! Beat yourself with both your sandals. Hope that will be an atonement for your sins. I apologised, didn't I? It's all right. Then, become friends with me. Hello! Why are you sitting alone? Purvi has not yet reached. - Cool! Shall I join you? - Sure. It's not my place to stop you from sitting. You are really humorous! Do you stay with your parents? No, I have no one. How similar! Even I don't have parents. I am also an orphan. You have got a brother at least. - Brother? You were touching his feet the other day, weren't you? That was not my brother. He is my friend. What do you mean? I mean, he is just my friend. Why do you ask? I just asked casually. Hey, what are you doing here? That.. She was sitting alone. So, I thought of giving her company till you came.. I'm here now. Out! Bye. Sit. - Hi, Gayathri! - Hi! Sorry, I'm late. How is the new place? It is really awesome! So, where is Charlie? I haven't seen him lately. Does he inquire about me when he calls you? No, I think he is busy. Okay. Shall I leave? - Wait.. Rishi is on his way. I'll tell him to drop you. No need.. I'll go on my own. Bye. - Bye. 'The number you've called is switched off.' Excuse me! Hello, ma'am. Come, I'll drop you. No, thanks. I can walk to my hostel. Hello, your hostel is far from here. Why do you have to walk till there? Come, I'll drop you. - Please! You can go. Don't be so stubborn. Come with me. I'm not being stubborn, but you are! If you keep seeing problems as problems it will always remain as a problem. Don't take trouble. Please come and sit in the car. See! You are surrounded by the forest. It's getting dark. What if some animal attacks you? How can I face the public? Am I correct? Come.. Sit inside. 'The number you've called is switched off.' 'Please try later.' Hello! - Hi! Where's Gayathri? - She has gone to the library. Why is she there? Won't girls get spoilt by studying too much? Oh, yes! Come, let's go and rescue her. Hello! - Okay, go on. You drive so slowly! - What's the urgency? You just sat on my bike. Do you think this is a public vehicle? Whatever! Drive fast. Before it gets dark, I want to roam around the city with you. What did you say? I need to meet Gayathri, so please drive fast. Hey, where are you taking me? Your place.. No, I mean.. I'm taking you to the place you mentioned. I wanted to go to the library. Hey, why did you make me drive back to my place? There lies the twist! - Twist? - Yes. Heck with your twist! I'm struggling. I can't hold it any longer. This place seems all right. What's wrong? I'll be right back. No matter what happens, don't turn back. 'This property belongs to Mr. Dharmaiya.' 'Trespassers will be prosecuted.' Oh! Don't you have any shame? I had a lot of it. But my dad took it with him when he passed away. Don't you think it's wrong to urinate in public? Hello! That's not wrong. Despite my warning, you were peeping at me. That's wrong! - Shucks! We are men. We are like lions and tigers! We can do anything anywhere! Lions and tigers don't dirty the city, but dogs do! I'm like a dog. Dogs are always honest and so am I! Do you want to see the sincerity of this dog? Come here. Didn't you doubt my sincerity? Oh, God! This phone won't even let me say my prayers peacefully. Who is calling now? Hello? - Greetings, sir. Yes.. What's the matter? The site that you own at Chamrajpet. Oh! Got it.. People from mobile companies, insurance companies and banks used to call and pester before. You real estate brokers have started pestering me now. Hey! Listen to me first. I saw your phone number on the board erected on your site. I got rid of the pests in my shop ran my business, and with my hard earned money I bought that land. On that sacred land of yours, we.. - What? Sorry, it's just me. I unintentionally passed urine. You! Not only you dirtied my land you are calling and informing me the same! Sir, I don't want anything for free. I've dropped a two-rupee coin below your board. You can collect it when you are here. Y-You! Who are you? Scoundrel! How dare you! How was that? - Superb! Well, why should I display my honesty in front of you? Hey, get up! Get up! My girl will be waiting for me. What about me? You were talking about being honest? Let it save you. See you. Diet. Diet is important for a man. A timely diet is most important. If we go behind girls we can neither eat on time nor drink on time. Now, I am in my true senses! If you dare, come and confront me! Who was she? Purvi, which means east. North, south, west.. Her ration card has only directions! Hey, no! Why am I bothered about other women? No.. "He stole a sari. He won the girl's heart." Oh, Mother India! Why did you come here, dear? You seemed to be scolding me. When boys are drunk, they scold girls. What's new in that? That's been a custom since ages. Hey, whatever you want to, do it in front of me. Then, I'll be really happy. Should I do everything in front of you? Hey, no.. You girls are such spoilt brats! Let all boys remain careful. Excuse me! You talk so sweetly! Actually, a man.. A young man like me talks sweetly only when intoxicated. But it's of no use. Girls don't let us drink and want us to speak sweetly. Hey, tell me. How can we talk sweetly without drinking? You only tell me! If you keep talking like this I just feel like looking at your face. I'll keep blabbering here and you sit back and listen to me. Just get lost! Hey.. Actually, when a girl praises a boy it's equivalent to drinking four pints of liquor. Oh, no.. Stop it, Gayathri. I need to go to the office early in the morning. You aren't supposed to do it now. - Hey, you.. Naughty.. "Just like mixing milk and honey.." I'll be a bit busy. Call me if you need something. Keep this money for your expenses. Be careful. - Okay. You too, take care. Oh, there you are! Are you fine? I am always fine! Hey, you left me alone in that condition. Who would take care of her if something happened to me? I'm here to take care. You can relax. If you won't feel bad, shall I ask you something? I'll definitely feel bad! Please don't ask me anything. She gets bored in the hostel. I'm thinking of taking her to my flat. - Oh, no! She is an innocent girl. You are a know-all. So, better keep some distance. Relax. I'm a very good girl. I'm a bird that flies to her nest well before dark. Do you know? - I do. Where are your wings? - I've given them to the laundry! Will you send her or not? Do you want to go? - Yes. Seems like you have planned this. Should I thank you for this favour? Nobody is doing anyone a favour. I am also being selfish. He's a traditional girl. She would maintain my house well, and she would cook for me. Oh! Which means, this princess here has agreed to become a servant at your house. Superb! All right, you carry on. I'll send your luggage there. Okay. - Keep it. Greetings! See you. Okay. Don't drink much! No. - 'Don't drink.' - Never. I won't drink. From today onwards, from now on I won't drink. This is the last drink. - 'Darn! Get lost!' - Okay? 'Good boy.' I won't drink hereafter. I will be a good boy. This will be my last drink. Oh, God! Enough of studying, eat something now! I won't compete with you for the first rank. You'll only get the first rank. I'm tired of these ranks. All right. By the way, what's wrong with Rishi? Rishi? He was born into a rich family. So, he's a bit spoilt. Hey, girls! Do you've anything left to eat or.. - Hey! What are you doing here? This fellow? He's my uncle's son. His father is my guardian. His father? - Yes. But didn't you tell me that you were an orphan? Did he tell you so? Scoundrel! Hey, naughty! Look forward and drive. I'm feeling so bored. - Why? - What else then? Hello! What? Nothing. Get into the class. Carry on. I have another class to attend. - Get lost! Purvi, the HOD was asking for you. I'm going. - Okay. But.. - Hey, come here. Go to the class. I'll meet the HOD and then join you. Did you propose to her? I'll propose now. Hi. Gayathri, I want to ask you a question. - Ask, sir. Just 'ask'. - I don't want to ask you anything. I mean, don't use honorifics. I'll try. - Thank you. Was that your question? - No, did you say something? No. - I thought I heard you say something. Have you gone bonkers? - Yes, kind of. I was keen on listening to you but you're not talking. Hello.. Get me a cup of tea. - Okay, ma'am. Hey, and a cup of coffee for me. - Okay, sir. Darn! Why are you pestering me? If Purvi sees us, you're done for. - Hey. Who's scared of Purvi? - You don't fear her either. He's mixed up our orders. That's right. Here you go. Don't drink it, please. - Why not? I've already tasted it. It's unhygienic now. You're an angel. I consider it a blessing. How many unhygienic cups have you used before? Hey, I swear. Trust me. I'm a nice guy. Promise. Two, three.. - Hush. Hi! What are you doing? I'm weeding out nits from grandmother's hair. How is she? She's fit and healthy as a horse. Do you want to speak to her? No, I'll talk to her some other time. I want to tell you something. - Hang on. Stay here. I'll be back. Now tell me, Gayathri. I'm delighted, Charlie. Thank you so much. Don't thank me for such trifles. Your happiness is all that matters. You're the reason for all this. Do you know how wonderful the world seems now? "Whose eyes will meet?" "Which heart could become a fan of the other?" "Which sort of guy will girls prefer?" "Which shadows are going for a hug?" "If you contemplate all the time" "you'll never get an answer." "Life is profound with a lover by your side." "Forget everything and hop on your bike." "Damn it, Charlie!" "It's almost like you've found heaven." "Become a tad bit careful daily." "Damn it, Charlie!" "It's almost like you've found heaven." "Become a tad bit careful daily." "You and me are the whole number." "Nobody wants to lose this party, because you're the number." "Don't be so superstitious. You're going to be in the rumble." "I want to see you. Please you." "I remember him before sleeping." "I remember him all morning." "My mind persists in his memories." "What do you think, buddy?" "Time spent with her feels superb." "Her laugh teases my heart." "My eyes wants to steal glimpses of her." "Great!" "My lover is like a sun." "He flirts with me." "He's the prince of my heart." "Damn it, Charlie!" "I'm losing my girl daily." "Love sucks." "I'm broke." "Damn it, Charlie!" "I'm losing my girl daily." "Love sucks." "I'm broke." "My heart beats a bit faster." "I like his lies too." "And the cell phone syncs all the happiness." "The gallery is full." "Her eyes sends a jolt through my spine." "My body shakes slightly." "But my shadow wants to touch her." "It's colourful." "He has a way with words. He comprehends tranquillity." "He's an expert in eye contact. "He's a friend bestowed on me by God." "Damn it, Charlie!" "He's leading in love." "He's not ordinary." "We won't tease you anymore." "Damn it, Charlie!" "He's leading in love." "He's not ordinary." "We won't tease you anymore." I'll leave. Bye. You can come inside and have coffee at least. At this hour? No. - But it's coffee time. No, I have to go. Why? Is someone waiting? It would have been wonderful if I had someone waiting for me. But there's no one. Someone I know very well keeps waiting for you but not right now as she's with you. If that person has to miss me and wait for me then I must go now. I'll leave. Okay. Bye. - Bye. See you. Why do you look so dull? Shut up, you can't possibly understand my sadness. What! Sadness? Tell me the reason. I'll add it to whiskey and drain it from you. Well.. - Go on. Well.. - Go on. Tomorrow is Gayathri's birthday. A spark in the eyes of a drunkard! Is there a better opportunity for a guy to meet a girl? I wanted some alcohol but I'm going to get a whole bottle. You're bothered about drink. I'm bothered about the girl. What should I gift her tomorrow? Tell me. Hey, express your love. What better gift could there be? Do you really think so? - Of course. You're here. Why did you get this? - Birthday wishes. Many many happy returns of the day. - Thank you. One more thing. I love you, Gayathri. Will you marry me? I'll be the best husband in the world. On one condition. You must propose me every year just as innocently with a ring. Okay? I too love you a lot. Without you, I'd go crazy, Rishi. Without you, my life has no purpose. I'd die. - Hey, how silly? There's no love without silliness. Hi. Charlie, you? Come. Sorry, I didn't know. I just came. It's all right. Ha.. Happy birthday. - Thanks. Hey, Charlie.. I feel sorry for you. Why do such things keep happening to you? Hey, why are you so gloomy? You have done so much for her but all you got in the end was pain. Pain? Why would I be hurt? All I want is her happiness. I'm extremely happy, buddy. Are you telling this to me or to yourself? Hey. Get lost. What's wrong with you? - What did I do? Why aren't you meeting anyone? I want to but I don't get anyone. We have to talk. Come - No, I'm not coming. I'm busy. - I can see what's keeping you busy. Are you coming or should I sit here? I don't come. Go. Why are you talking so weirdly, Charlie? That's who I am. No one wants me. I don't want anyone, either. What happened? - Nothing happened, right? You know nothing, right? Do you know how much I love you? What! You love me! I fell in love with you the moment I saw you. Then why didn't you tell me before? It isn't late now, right, Gayathri? It's too late now. It's all your fault. All the fault is mine. I thought you'd be with me all my life. The fault is mine. I thought you wouldn't leave me. Was that a mistake? What's the mistake? What's the mistake? I don't want reasons. You're mine. You shouldn't love anyone else. Right here, right now you should leave everything and come with me. Please don't separate me from Rishi, Charlie. Please don't separate me from Rishi, Charlie. Please try to understand. "A bird spread its wings" "and flew away." "My heart is tormented by worries." "Life feels empty" "like a deserted fair. "I was fooled by her charms." "I lost the desire to dream." "My life has been torn to pieces." "You sung the love lullaby" "a bit too late." "A walk down memory lane" "wells me up with tears." "Hey, God.." "Hey, God.." "I'm embarking on a journey to the sea with a pearl." "The pearl is behind me, and it's priceless." "It got swept away by the waves." "Life has become meaningless." "She's in every tear I shed." "She is in every beat of my heart." "Belief has died." "This betrayal is painful." "She sown the seed of love" "and it died." "Hey, God.." "Hey, God.." What's going on here? I was out of town for a few days.. Don't you have brains? - I'm sorry, Purvi. I didn't expect this outcome. You mean to say you never loved Charlie? How is that possible? He helped me turn my life around. I worship him, respect him but that's not love. You fool, worship is the pinnacle of love, Gayathri. How come you didn't understand this? It's a huge loss for you. If you love a guy, it should be someone like Charlie. A guy should love her girl like Charlie does. Poor fellow. He must have had so many dreams. What's my well-wisher doing here? How do I look? - Everything's fine in the world. I'm talking about myself. - Aren't you part of the world? I'm not smart enough to counsel or console you. Why can't you forget the past, thinking of it as a bad dream? I want to forget, too. But I can't even remember what happened. And why should I forget if I remember? I'll tell you what. See things from my perspective. You'll understand everything. Why do people who think emotionally regarding unrequited love think rationally about life? Life is greater than love. Know that. There's a gulf of difference between knowing and understanding. You can't just love anybody. That's true. I'm not saying falling in love is wrong. The ultimate intention of love is love. Wanting everything you like is stubbornness, not love. It's selfishness. It's an insult to love. Nice speech. I'll predict what you'll say next. 'Love but have the endurance to bear betrayals.' 'Love is like a fever. It must go away.' 'You shouldn't let it bog you down.' This is what you wanted to say! Now, listen to what I have to say. Yes, I made a mistake. Love need not be reciprocal. I didn't understand this basic premise. I'm a bloody fool. Hey, I still consider her mine. But how can I think so? What's the.. Hey, what did you say earlier? That my love is selfish and is an insult? Fine. Listen closely. She's complete freedom. She can live as she chooses to. But she must be happy. I won't trouble her in anyway. Now go. Who are you? Why doesn't everyone get a person like you? Did you see the power of my love? I made you cry, too. Purvi, did you think I'd commit suicide because of love failure? Hello, I'm way too macho for that. I'm a very tough guy. I'll take a shower. If you say yes, we'll go out. Am I making a mistake? - No, dear. Why do you think so? I've never incited love in Charlie. I know that too. Poor fellow. It's all my fault. I'll apologise to him. You won't cheat me, will you? Why do you think like this? You're always mine. Yes, tell me. - Come to Chamrajpet park fast. All right. - Come alone. Okay, I'll come alone. I have some work. I'll be back. Why did you bring me here? When you're in agony and frustrated with your life places like these can offer you consolation. Can't you think about things other than this? Why not? These movie makers elevate love to divinity and build huge mansions. We must break their window panes and run away. - Superb. Great idea. Why did he come here? Did he come to see if I was still alive? Please, Charlie. I invited him here to talk to you. Stop, Purvi. Let him scold me till his anger subsides. If not, let him beat me. Look, Charlie, I'll just say one thing. If I knew you loved her I wouldn't have come between you both. You're so talkative, so why didn't you reveal your feelings? Look, it's not her fault. Don't punish her for she's innocent. She considers you God. If you keep up with this behaviour, she'll die. Hey, she's a child. If she ever cries, I'll kill you. Don't worry. I won't betray Gayathri at any cost. Trust me. - It's always about Gayathri. I'm invisible to you, right? Go to hell! - Purvi.. Hey. Tut! What is it? She can't speak. Can you come without informing? I came. So what? Won't your friends be concerned about you? Are you a friend? Why should you be concerned? Amazing! You tried to console me but became crazy in the process. Yes, I'm crazy about you. Looks like finally this crazy guy found a crazy girl. - What? Should I teach you to hug, too? Everybody wants to teach me. Are you going to teach this uber-macho guy? Go on. There are three categories of hugging. Great. Go on. The first one is how siblings hug each other. - Okay. And this is how best friends do it. - Okay. And this is.. - This is us. "A boy hugged a girl." "And a girl hugged a boy." "This demands for a song." "A boy's touch makes me skip a heartbeat." "Let me go for fantasy. She is making me crazy." "Let me tell you a story. Purvi was sitting beside me." "Purvi. P-Purvi.." "I gave her a letter at school. I gave her a flower at college." "And then I dropped out of college." "Oh, God, loving her became my full time job" "When he dropped out of college" "I dropped out after him, oh God." "And then I fell in love with him." "Falling in love makes you an emotional person." "It's better to get engaged fast." "I insist, Shivalingu.." "The boy loves me madly." "He calls me on my mobile all the time." "If I do anything wrong. My life will be a sad song." "I may have to sing a sad song, life long.." "A girl's touch" "will turn a boy into a statue.." "He is hunk from Mandya. He has a bold attitude." "He walks like the King of Mysore. He has a heart of gold." "An astrologer told me that such" "a boy will come in search of me." "A girl who talks sweetly, who's the personification of love" "Who's as gorgeous as a doll. And who's body is made of silk." "An astrologer had predicted" "that she'd come meet me in a carnival." "Your laugh is infectious. - I like your cheeks." "Your are making me blush." "I like the sound of your anklet." "The sound your bangles make is soothing." "I am delighted, you know. - I am delighted, too." "A girl's touch" "will turn a boy into a statue.." "I remember the way you kissed me, the sari you wore then." "The sound that your earring made and the way you bit my ear." "And I vividly remember you buying me 'Davangere Benne Dosa.'" "You first saw me in a carnival. And winked at me at mango grove." "You kissed me at a banana shop. And married me at a fair." "My mind is telling me that he's the one who did all this." "Stop peeking at me.. - Start following me.." "Give me a warm hug. - Weather is cold, too." "It's time to have some sweet dreams." "I am delighted, you know. - I am delighted, too." "A boy's touch" "will turn a girl into a statue.." 'I can't stay behind bars anymore.' 'Get me out of jail.' 'I was longing to hear this.' 'Don't worry. I'll get you out.' Hello. What's wrong? I asked you to take care of Gayathri. Why did you do this to her? - What happened? Gayathri is pregnant. Wow! Why are you dull then? Don't take it lightly. Be serious. It's happy news. I'll handle my dad, don't worry. I am sure he will be happy to become a grandpa. You made my life. Bye. What's happening? You bloody! Rishi.. My son.. Karjola. - Sir. Take them home. - Sure, sir. I'll take care of things here. - Okay. Oh, it's you. The pimp. How dare you pimped her to him? How much did he pay you? I'm going to pay you double. Take it! Grab a weapon.. Grab it now.. Sir, please pull yourself together. Everybody must die someday. You are right. But I never thought my son would abandon me forever.. He was a healthy young man. He always had smile on his face. And made people laugh. He lived like a king. How could he die.. I didn't want him to be a gangster. That's why I sent him away from me. He didn't harm them in anyway. I have built a crime empire in the last twenty years. No gang member had dared to look into my eyes. No one talked back to me. How can I stomach the fact that a petty gang member had murdered my son? Who the heck is he? Sir, please calm down. I will make them pay for this. I want to know who killed him. I won't rest until then. Where is Prasanna and his gang? I want to know their whereabouts and what they are up to by tomorrow morning. I want to know.. Sir. - Yes. This morning somebody had killed Prasanna's brother Raghava and badly injured his associates. Somebody murdered Raghava? Who is he? Who is he! He's Ms. Purvi's friend, Charlie. Purvi! Uncle, he's not a murderer. He is a gentleman. Don't cry. Why did you do it? What rivalry you had with Raghava? I will kill anybody who hurts Gayathri. Who's Gayathri? You son loved Gayathri. Hey! Don't try to take me for a ride, got it? Uncle, he's telling the truth. There's one more thing. Gayathri is pregnant with Rishi's child. Gayathri is pregnant.. Tell me what you want. I don't want him to go to jail, Uncle. I will make an arrangement for that right away. Karjola. - Sir. Ask two of our boys to surrender at the police station. I will have a chat with the police commissioner. Hey! Join me. Sir, I can't. I am sorry. - Why? I don't belong here, sir. Bye. Hey! Gayathri, please don't weep. I learnt all about you and my son. I can't live without Rishi, sir. My dear child.. I can understand the pain you're going through. Because I'm going through the same pain, dear. I don't see a point in living. Dear, you must live for the sake of your yet-to-be-born child. And for posterity. I want you to forget what has happened. You must be happy, my dear. You worthless moron. - What did you say? When my brother was being killed what the heck were you doing, you moron? Calm down. Anger is good for nothing, Prasanna. Your brother got killed because he acted in haste. Stop lecturing me, okay? Looking after him was your job. You're an ungrateful jerk! Arrange for a few gang members, I'll go myself this time. And I'll kill him! Even with a 100 strong gang you won't be able to kill him. If you call yourself a man, then accompany me. Or if you're a coward, stay back. I'll get you some bangles to wear when I return. Hey! Don't be a lunatic. We need a plan to kill him. Let's put the past behind us and lead a happy life, okay? Are we on the same page? Yes. Mr. Cheluvanarayana Swamy. - Yes. I can interpret your silence. But if you don't talk now, I'll go crazy. Crazy? You mean, you weren't crazy all these days. What's up? What do you want? You're boss has clearly crossed the line. Tell me something that I don't know about him. What are you asking me for? Why don't you go talk to him? I don't have to go looking for him. He will come looking for me now. He will find you guys. And he's going to kill you all. - Really? Give it here. I'm not going to kill you. Go tell your boss that we did this to you. Mr. Charlie, I have never seen you laugh before. Sorry, Purvi. I was rude to you all these days. Charlie! Hey, what happened to you? They are still there on the next street. - Purvi. Hey! Charlie, are you all right? - Charlie.. Charlie, wake up. Charlie, get up. Charlie, please wake up. Charlie, look at me. Sir, there's a phone call for you. Tell me, dear. Some people had attacked Charlie. His condition is quite serious. I have hospitalised him. Which hospital? Sir, nothing to worry. He's all right. Karjola. - Sir. If I don't give them a befitting reply now it will be an insult to my profession. He must die. You are a tough man. Gayathri. How are you? Don't worry about me. How are you doing? It all happened because of me. But you are still worried about me.. Hey! - Gayathri. Gayathri, please don't go.. Gayathri. - Karjola, follow her. - Yes, sir. Karjola! Gayathri.. Hey! Let her go. Let her go. Leave her alone! Let's go. Gayathri.. - Uncle, what happened to you? Uncle, are you all right? - Gayathri! Uncle, talk to me. Get Charlie now. Gayathri.. Ask him to save Gayathri. - Who attacked you? I thought you would be dead. I won't die before killing you. I love your attitude. You were almost beaten to death. And I had put two bullets into your body. But your attitude hasn't changed. I didn't acquire it. It's ingrained in me. You have kept a woman captive. How do you call yourself a man? Hey.. It has got nothing to do with my manhood. That's what matters. Come save her life if you have it. You didn't invite me. You have invited your death! Welcome.. I am waiting for you. You rascal! I knew you would show up! You thrashed me the other day, didn't you? Get him! Hey. Hey! You killed my brother because he liked her, didn't you? Don't dare to hurt her. Or I'll kill you all. I am going to slit her throat now. Hey! Charlie. Kill him. Gayathri. Gayathri, get up. Gayathri.. Gayathri.
