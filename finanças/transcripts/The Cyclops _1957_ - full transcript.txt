[♪♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪♪] I feel very sorry, Señorita Winters, but I cannot grant permission to your party to fly across the Sierra Tarahumare. It is against government orders. Governor, for three years I have waited and planned on this trip. I won't give up. It is very unfortunate that your determination clashes with my orders. But I cannot help you. After three long years, you know that your fiancé could not be alive under the best of circumstances. I disagree with you. Two months after his plane crashed you received radio calls from him. Why not let me try? Three years after your fiancé disappeared, you still are in love with him. I envy him, señorita. But let me ask you a few questions. Of course. You arrived by propeller plane with three men? Yes. Señor Lee Brand. Who is he? My pilot. I hired him for the flight. Russ Bradford. Russ is a bacteriologist at the New York Institute of Toxicology. Also on your pay? No. He's Bruce's friend. - Bruce? - My fiancé. The man you want to find. Yes. Martin Melville. He too is in our party. He brought a precision scintillator. Do you know what a scintillator is used for, señorita? A very powerful instrument that can detect uranium deposits, even from the air. Obviously, Señor Melville has an ulterior objective. His goal does not seem to be to help you in your search for your fiancé. Mr. Melville financed part of my trip. I'm not rich enough myself. My investigation does not give Señor Melville a pleasant light. He was involved in certain stock transactions in Texas. I know nothing of his transactions. Are you sure? Every one of your expeditions seems to have a motive of his own. What are you talking about? The government does not want Sierra Tarahumare explored by any adventurers. Adventurers? A pilot who cannot find a job in his country. A bacteriologist whose real objective is very mysterious to me. A stock manipulator who wants to survey Tarahumare for uranium. And you, who's looking for a man who died three years ago. Then you don't believe me? I do, because I am a romantic man. But still, I cannot help you. No one ever return from Tarahumare, señorita. So don't do anything foolish. Señorita, I am placing one of my men next to your pilot, in case he should lose his way on your return trip. My plane has four seats and we are four people. Then one has to stay behind. Of course, governor. I'll see to it that one stays behind. [♪♪♪♪♪♪] Buenos dias, señorita. A magazine. A sports magazine. Oh, how can I say magazine? Oh, uh, like a book. A libro. Read. Comprendo? [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] You don't understand me. I want a sports magazine. Uh, you said you spoke English. Oh, si, señor. That's fine, then. Give me a Sports Afield. Si. Well, come on, Sports Afield. Guns, baseball... [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] No, no, no. Oh, like this. American magazine. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Uh, no, no. I want American magazine. Understand? Americano. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Sports Afield. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Uh, yeah, Sports Afield. Here you are. Keep the change, señorita. Gracias, señor. Sports Afield. You know, I'm going to study Spanish when I get home. I don't think you will. Hey, I-- I wonder where Susan is. She should've been back a long time ago. And will you knock off with that stuff? How are you going to run the plane? Don't worry about it. That bothers me. My drinking? We should never have let Susan go to see the governor alone. I should've gone with her. Or you, Lee, or you, Marty. Oh, there are reasons for us. For one, well, her legs are prettier than yours are. Yeah. Never underestimate the powers of a woman. Susan is determined. I know. Try and stop her. You know, if I only had half her drive... Yeah? What would you be? Yeah. Yeah, what would I be? Say, do either one of you guys think that Bruce Barton is still alive? Bruce? Well, how could he be? It's been three years since his plane crashed and no one's heard a word from him. Well, then why does she keep on looking? You know how it is. No, how is it? Well, Bruce was very much in love with her and she with him. But love changes aspect in her case. Being in love with a dead man. Rather morbid, isn't it? There's a clinical name for it, Lee. It's called mania. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Oh, there she is now. Well, the professor seems to know all the answers. Even about love. I doubt that. Don't sell him short, Marty. You never know what's happening behind that calm exterior of his. [INAUDIBLE] Well, how'd you come out? Yeah, you don't look happy. I couldn't do a thing with the governor. - No permit? - No. That's okay by me. You got paid for the flight, didn't you? Well, sure, sure. That's why I don't mind flying back home to Texas. I never could get used to tequila. Who says we're going back? Well, if we can't fly east, I guess we'll have to fly north. Well, but, uh, why couldn't we start north and then turn east? Oh, we could, we could. If they didn't send a fighter after us. Well, they wouldn't do that, would they? - Then we're all set. - Uh, not quite. The governor wants us to take a security man along, make sure we fly in the right direction. But we only have a four-passenger plane. Yeah, didn't you tell him that? Of course I did. So, someone will have to stay behind. Someone? But who? I don't think we'll have any problems. [♪♪♪♪♪♪] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [♪♪♪♪♪♪] MAN [OVER RADIO]: Ten-fifty-six, 10-56. This is the tower, over. Don't answer it. Tower, 10-5-6. Over. Ten-fifty-six, this is the tower. Return to the field. Return to the field at once. You are heading towards a restricted area of the mountains. There are dangerous downdrafts. I repeat, dangerous downdrafts. He's just trying to scare us. Don't pay any attention. Keep going. Miss Winters, you're the boss. - Shall I turn back? - No. You are disobeying official orders. I repeat, you are disobeying official orders. This is your final warning. You will be punished to the full-- Well, that takes care of that. Now we're on a one-way flight. [♪♪♪♪♪♪] Sorry you came along? Sorry? Why, of course not. How could I have stayed behind? Bruce was a friend of mine. And you know how I feel about you. I realize you have to look for him, whether you find him or not. Oh, Bruce is alive. I'm sure of it. It's important to both of us if we find out. He's alive. You say you got oil wells in Texas. How come you're flying a plane for dough? Don't mix up the tenses. I had oil wells. The day the company wanted to buy, they went dry. Heh-heh. Well, maybe that was lucky for you. Yeah, how lucky can I get? Well, you met me, didn't you? How is that for compensation? [CHUCKLES] I'm gonna make you a millionaire. Okay, accepted. Now how do we go about it? There's uranium behind those mountains. The geological formation is just perfect. All we gotta do is find it. And you think the government will license you to take it out? Heh-heh. Who wants to take it out? All we gotta do is file the claims and then float a stock issue. That's what you have in mind? Sure. There's only two kind of people. Those that get rich and the suckers that furnish the money. And what side are you on? Do I look like a sucker? This scintillator will find the stuff. [♪♪♪♪♪♪] - What's that down there? - What? [♪♪♪♪♪♪] I saw something. What did it look like? Looked like an animal, as big as an elephant. There are no elephants in Mexico. LEE: It was probably the plane's shadow. MARTY: Hey, get a load of this. The meter's going crazy. I'll switch it to the other scale. She's still on top! Heh-heh-heh. Maybe your needle's stuck. No. The scintillator's alright. There's uranium down there! [♪♪♪♪♪♪] Hey, what are you doing? Don't fly so low. According to my computation, we're right near the spot we're looking for. Circle the area, Lee. We've hit downdrafts. I'll have to take her up a few thousand feet until the air smooths out. [♪♪♪♪♪♪] No better up here. That Mexican captain wasn't kidding when he mentioned downdrafts. Updrafts, downdrafts, I don't like none of it. Let's go lower. See if we can find a clearing. Put this thing down. There must be a clearing down there somewhere. Now close your eyes and relax. When your number's called it's called. Yeah, but if your number's called, what about me? [♪♪♪♪♪♪] Will you put this thing down like I told you? [♪♪♪♪♪♪] Let go! Let go! [GRUNTING] Let go or you'll-- Unh! Let go! Lee! RUSS: Let go or you'll-- Let go! Unh! [♪♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪♪] [PANTING] Uh, you were choking me. You hurt my back. Keep your hands out of the controls. Well, she's okay. But how are we gonna get out of here? I don't care. We're near Bruce. A few feet one way or the other and our troubles would have been over for good. [♪♪♪♪♪♪] [HISSING NEARBY] [♪♪♪♪♪♪] [HISSING] Lee! Susan! SUSAN: What is it? LEE: What are you looking at? - There. - Where? RUSS: By those rocks. Nothing. I guess it's just my imagination. Hey, look. Hey! Eight-point-five! What do you mean? Eight-five. Here! And here. And over there. I can't believe it. We're standing on pure uranium. It's worth millions. Billions! It's worth nothing if you can't get it out. And what I'd like to know is how we're gonna get out of here ourselves. [♪♪♪♪♪♪] Way I got it figured, we got a bigger strike than that big one up in Canada. Don't spend it. This is where Bruce's plane crashed. It looks like canyon area, similar to the one we're in now. Yeah. Yeah, we're getting close. We'll have to go through some brush country and some jungle. Let me see that. Yeah. Shouldn't take us more than a day to hike there. Not me. I ain't walking no place. [CREATURE GROWLS] [CREATURE GROWLS] [♪♪♪♪♪♪] That's good. Thanks. There. Ha. That thing don't weigh nothing. Not as much as your cad. Say, you think she's gonna get us over that mountain? Lee, Marty, don't you think we'd better go on before the day gets too hot? Not me. I told you, I ain't walking no place. I wanna go back. We're going on, Marty. - Is that what you say? - She's the boss. But that's ridiculous. We found what we came for, didn't we? You found what you came for. But we didn't just fly in here to please you, Marty. I paid my share, didn't I? And the plane belongs to me. I bought it for the trip. Susan, we came here to find uranium and we found it. That isn't why I came, Marty, and you know it. But you'll be part owner in the biggest uranium deposit in the whole world. Come on, let's fly back and file our claims. That makes better sense than searching for a skeleton. They're crazy. Come on, let's be practical. Let's sit down. [SIGHS] You know, if we all leave now, we could be into town before dark and file our claims. Now, here's where we are, right here. Hey, pay attention, will you? If we stake out from here to here-- - Hey, I got an idea. - What? Why don't you fly me out? I couldn't do that. Why not? And leave Russ and the girl behind? Oh, but two in a claim is better than four. One is even better than two, Marty. Oh, I didn't mean you should leave 'em here for good. Marty, she hired me to fly her in here and out. Okay, but she didn't say when you had to fly her out. You can come back and get her. And besides, with two less people in the plane, we got a better chance getting over that mountain. Oh, Marty, you are off your course. No, no, I know I'm right on the beam. Let her go look for her dead sweetheart. She didn't hire you for that. You're a pilot, not a guide to lead a safari into nowhere. [♪♪♪♪♪♪] He must've walked through here. - Bruce? - Yes. A woman's intuition. You still don't believe me, do you? Susan, you're a level-headed woman, but you must realize it would be impossible for Bruce to be alive after three years in this kind of terrain. If you feel that way, why did you come along? Why did you encourage me? Because I love you. And because I'm tired of competing with a dead man. Russ, he isn't dead. We know the exact spot where his plane went down. But wouldn't he have tried to walk back to civilization? How could he have crossed those mountains? What can I say to convince you? [CREATURE SQUEAKING] What is that? [WINGS FLAPPING] I don't know. [♪♪♪♪♪♪] Sounds like the flutter of a bird's wing. SUSAN: There's an animal on that log. It's a mouse. RUSS: A rodent of some kind. Look, Susan, look! [BIRD SQUAWKING] [RODENT SQUEALING] [♪♪♪♪♪♪] RUSS: Now I know I wasn't imagining things when I thought I saw that giant lizard yesterday. [SQUAWKING] Why are they so large? I don't know, but I intend to find out. And give up searching? If it's what I think it is, it might not be safe around here. I can't quit now. Susan, if anything happened to you, I'd never forgive myself. You've got to face reality. Alright, alright. We'll continue the search, but don't say anything about this to Lee and Marty. Marty's trouble enough. [PLANE ENGINE STARTS] [♪♪♪♪♪♪] [PLANE ENGINE REVS, SHUTS OFF] What's the hurry? Yeah, what's the matter? You didn't think we were going to leave you, did you? We were just testing the motor. It's okay. Glad you found out. That ain't no reason for Russ to be pointing a rifle at me. LEE: Now, you really don't think we'd leave without you. Of course not. Would you give me the keys? LEE: They're in the panel. Get 'em for me, Russ. Sure. Hey, What's going on? You don't act like you trust us. I'll keep the keys. Let's get started. You and your bright ideas. We'll take only the necessary equipment along. Are you leaving right now? [SIGHS] Marty, you needn't come with us. It wasn't in our agreement, so if you want to stay behind, you can. That goes for you, Lee. I wouldn't think of letting you two go alone. Alright. I don't want to stay here by myself, but I think you're making a big mistake. We'll be lucky if we get back alive. Oh, come on, let's get our gear. Aw... [♪♪♪♪♪♪] Water. I wouldn't even swim in it. Boil it. I'd rather lace it with a shot of bourbon. You know, the day I run out of that stuff is the day I go home. You know, it's strange, isn't it? We haven't seen one animal since we left the plane, not even a fly. Heh, heh. Believe me, I don't miss 'em. Oh, I'd like to get me a nice wild turkey. They're supposed to be around here. It's strange. Everywhere we take this scintillator, it registers. This whole country must be one huge bed of uranium. RUSS: It might not be uranium. What else could it be? Could be some other radioactive ore, like thorium, for instance. It is uranium. I should've hired my own plane. What a wild goose chase. What a waste of time. [CREATURE ROARS] Hey, did you hear that? What do you think that was? Meat, that's what it was. Russ, give me that gun. I'm going to get us some camp meat. - You better stay here. - Why? Susan and I saw some strange animals. What kind of animals? It sounds unbelievable, but... Well, what did you see? Mammoths? Dinosaurs? SUSAN: In a way. Heh. You must be dreaming. What are you talking about? RUSS: Yes, it's true, Marty. Susan and I saw... Well, a rodent as big as a dog and a hawk about 12 feet tall. [LAUGHS] And you didn't tell us? I am gonna have a look-see. - Wait. I'll go with you. - I'm going too. What's the matter, Marty? Don't you want to see what it is? No. I'm staying right here. Come on. [♪♪♪♪♪♪] [CREATURE ROARS] That doesn't sound like wild turkey. [CREATURE ROARS] Maybe we'd better go back to camp. Don't worry. This is a thirty-ought-six. It'll kill anything we'll run across. Come on. [♪♪♪♪♪♪] [BUZZING] Don't shoot. [ROARING] - Aah! - Susan! [SCREAMS] [♪♪♪♪♪♪] - [ROARING] - Shoot! [GUNSHOT] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [ROARS] Come on. [♪♪♪♪♪♪] Coffee? - Oh, thanks. - It's hot. Now you ready to call it quits? Marty, I told you you could wait with the plane. That's where we're going right now, ain't it? I'm not. Maybe Lee wants to. Hey, what's the matter with that crazy girl? She want to commit suicide? Get us all killed? I'm with you, Marty. But I've got a contract with the young lady. You didn't have a contract when you wanted to fly me out. LEE: I just remembered. You didn't get paid to get eaten by prehistoric animals, did you? That would be a novel death. "Lee Brand Swallowed By Dinosaur." Oh... Hey, Russ. Russ. You got any sense left? Ah, take it easy, Marty. "Take it easy." Take it easy! Have some coffee. How can you be so calm when you know if we don't get out now, we may never get out of here? Oh, look here, Marty. We can't leave. Not now. Susan never would. Alright, leave her here. Let her go on and look for that guy that's been dead for years. You really would leave her, wouldn't you? Okay, you be a hero. But you can't force me to stay here. She can tell Lee to fly me out. Oh, no. When we leave, we'll all leave together. MARTY: Oh, if I'd known what a bunch of idiots I was getting tied up with. Marty, those were no prehistoric creatures we saw. They're animals of our time, only grown to enormous size. Alright, then write about them when you get back to civilization. I'm not going to leave until I found out why they never stop growing. It could be the most important discovery of the century. [SIGHS] Crazy. Insane. They're all crazy. [♪♪♪♪♪♪] That thing's dead. RUSS: Not yet. It's still breathing. Yeah... [LIZARD PANTING] That's fairly obvious, isn't it? Hold this please. What are you going to do? There's no danger now. I must have a section of the skin tissue. Skin tissue? Yes, I must have it. Why, you... [♪♪♪♪♪♪] Hold the light closer, will you? Is it possible? What are you looking at, doc? Skin tissue of the lizard. The cells seem to multiply like bacteria. They split every 22 seconds. Look for yourself. LEE: What does it mean, they split? It means that there's no limit to the potential size of the animal. It grows continuously. What, it's life? Well, there must be some limit. The secret of continuous, limitless multiplication of living cells in ordinary animals. Russ, what controls our growth? Huh? Oh, the pituitary gland. LEE: Then if the gland gets out of whack... Well, if that should happen, then the gland becomes over-productive, the body just keeps enlarging. Like the animals we saw. There must be something here that stimulates them. Some radioactive substance. In the soil. Or the water. I-if what you say is true, then we might grow bigger and bigger. Heh. That's a pheasant thought. "Lee Brand returns home 18 feet tall." Heh. That's even big for Texas. Is that what could happen to us? Marty, what was the scintillator's highest reading? Oh, I don't know, it's... uh... 8.5. 8.5... Then there's no danger. Not yet. The body can absorb about 5 milliroentgen within a period of one week before it reaches a critical stage. One week and we've been out three days. Yeah, but we still got time to get out of here. But we're so close to Bruce's plane. Now, look, we're gonna put this to a vote. You got no right to endanger the lives of all three of us any longer. I think Marty has a point. - There'll be no voting. - What do you mean? Susan, we'd better go back. When are we gonna get out of here? At daybreak. But that's too late, let's leave tonight! [♪♪♪♪♪♪] Susan. What is it? [SHUDDERS] I have the feeling something's watching me. Watching you? [SIGHS] I don't know. [♪♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪♪] [SCREAMING] RUSS: Susan! Russ, a bent twig. Told ya I was part Indian. Russ. Wing section. Probably Bruce's plane. Come on. RUSS: Well, you said you was part Indian, Lee. Where are we? This must be the other canyon indicated on the map. Susan was right. This is where he crashed. There's another part of his plane. Well, I can't understand it. Why are the plane parts scattered all over the place? Must have blown up in midair. If it did, how can you account for the engine being in this cave? It would take three good men to lift it. [CRYING] Susan. Susan. Susan! - Susan, it's me, Russ! - It stared at me. RUSS: What happened? How did you get here? It bit at me and then it came towards me. What came towards you? The eye! Susan. Susan! Susan, it's Russ! Hey, what's wrong with her? She's hysterical. Look. Somebody's been living here. There's been a fire. There's a flying suit. And a watch. But-- - A watch? - Yeah. It's Bruce's watch. I told you he was alive. He might be. [RUMBLING] [♪♪♪♪♪♪] Hey, what's that? [ROARS] RUSS: Watch out. [ROARING] Back up slowly. - Get down! - Unh! Look out. RUSS: Look out, Marty. [CYCLOPS GROANING] [CYCLOPS GRUNTS] [FOOTSTEPS] He must be 25 feet tall. [SIGHS] He lives here. His growth will never stop. I've studied the effects of radiation on living organisms. Cells react very promptly from radiation. Yeah. Doctor Geiser, and four to one, working on a wavelength of 1800-- How can you be so coldblooded? You sound like you're enjoying this. I am. As a scientist. But we've got to figure some way to get out of here. There's only one thing to do. Let's shoot him! No! Russ is right. That rifle would never kill him. He's wounded, he might kill us. He showed some intelligence. Intelligence makes him more dangerous, That's true. But still, we might be able to communicate with him. Communicate? [♪♪♪♪♪♪] You alright, Susan? Well, we're all alive. Hey, Lee. You got a drink? I need a drink. Yeah. Ugh. Empty. Didn't I say that would be the time to go home? Huh. Let's get out of here. I can't stand it. Take it easy, Marty. Come on. Let's get out of here. [SHOUTING]: Marty! Marty! Marty, come back! We're safer in here! I don't care! I wanna get out of here! Or we're all gonna-- [GRUNTS] [GROANING] Well, there he is. Let's try to talk to him. Think he understands English? Well, that isn't the idea. A voice might calm him. Okay. Talk to him. Susan, you try it, a woman's voice. What should I say to him? Say anything. My name? Yes, that's it. Go on, your name. My name is Susan. Susan Winters. [GRUNTING] He's looking at her. Can you hear me? We're friends. We're looking for a man. His name is Bruce. Have you seen this man? I must find him. Go on, talk some more. Try to understand. Please? The airplane parts. Do you know how they got here? He reacted. Do you know about the flying suit? And the watch? [GRUNTING CONTINUES] They belong to the pilot, my... fiancé. You do understand, don't you? You know where he is, please? Help us find him, please. [ROARING] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [GROANING] [GROANING] Wait! Wait? He'll kill her. He might let her go. What makes you think so? Just wait. [GROANING CONTINUES] Look. He's trying to remember something. Remember? Uh-huh. [HISSING] [GASPS] [ROARS] Susan! [♪♪♪♪♪♪] [CYCLOPS ROARS] [GRUNTING] Where's Marty? He's dead. [GRUNTING CONTINUES] RUSS: Get the food and water. Get down! Over there. [GROANING] [ALL PANTING] [CYCLOPS GROANING] You two stay here. I'm gonna have a look around. He might see you. Don't worry. I'm one-sixteenth Indian. Hungry? Well, what is it? [SIGHING] Something else. Tell me. Well, I can't express it. Something about that giant makes me terribly sad. Yes, I know. But that's not the right word. No. It isn't. I feel sorry for him. I pity him. And I don't know why. It's as though I were involved. Personally. Well can't you figure it out? No. I tried, but... That left side. It's not completely mutilated... makes me feel so sorry for him. Susan, you came here to find Bruce. What do you mean? A man of ordinary size... would grow to be a giant in this place. You can't dismiss the idea, that the giant and the parts of the plane, that he had in the cave with him, are somehow connected. He must have found Bruce's plane after it crashed. He might. Or he might not. He could've been a man of ordinary size? With a scar over his left eye. A scar? The radioactive substances in the soil... started to work on his glands. And over a period of 3 years-- [SOBS] Bruce! Bruce! [♪♪♪♪♪♪] - I lied to you. - Lied? Yeah. I'm a half Indian. He's out there. Did you see him? Yeah. He's asleep. We better get going while the going's good. I've got to take a look at him. - No, Russ. - Susan, I must! Come on. Susan, wish us luck. Luck? Yeah. If we have to walk right by him. What if he wakes up? That's what I said. Wish us luck. Ah, c'mon. [CYCLOPS SNORING] [GRUNTS] [MUMBLES] [SNORES] [MOANS] [SNORES] [♪♪♪♪♪♪] This doesn't look right to me. This way. Now, I'm a full-blooded Indian. [♪♪♪♪♪♪] The keys. Russ, you've got them. How about these? An extra set. [♪♪♪♪♪♪] [ENGINE FAILING TO START] [CYCLOPS MOANING] Hurry up. Hurry up, Lee. [ENGINE NOT STARTING] [CYCLOPS MOANING] Forget the plane. Let's try to make it up the hill. [CYCLOPS MOANS] [CYCLOPS SCREAMS] C'mon! Hurry! [CYCLOPS MOANS] He remembers. Remembers what? His past. The plane. What did he fly? A boxcar? He's gonna wreck it. If I can I'm gonna attract his attention, and get him away from there. [MOANS] Hey! Here I am over here. Hey! [MOANS LOUDER] C'mon! [CYCLOPS MOANS] [GROANS] [MOANS] [SCREAMS] [MOANING AND GROANING] [MOANS] [SCREAMS] [YELLS] [SCREAMS] [♪♪♪♪♪♪] [MOANS] [ENGINE STARTING] Pull her up, Lee. Come on, Lee, pull her up. [CYCLOPS MOANS] SUSAN: His arms! We'll never make it! [♪♪♪♪♪♪]
