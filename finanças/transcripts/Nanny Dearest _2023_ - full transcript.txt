Dammit! Shh! Abbie, come on, come on. It's not so bad. Shh! Stop it, stop crying. She's just hungry. Then you need to feed her. I got to go. You feed her. I'm wiped. Shh! Be quiet! Shut up! Shut up! - Shut up! - Hey! Hey! Hey! Easy, would ya? She's just hungry. What is wrong with you? I'm late, that's what's wrong. I'm putting her formula on the counter. Your boyfriend needs to get a damn job. I'm not a hotel. Mother, please, don't start. And you need to stop screaming at your baby. It only makes it worse. Where the hell are you off to? Gonna make us some money. Good morning, Mrs. Thompson. - How are you? - Go to hell. Okay, Taylor, I just have a couple more questions. Um, have you given birth before? Yes, I have a baby. She's nine months old. Please don't waste my time. - I'm sorry? - New mothers who are breastfeeding cannot donate eggs. You should've been told that. Oh, I'm not breastfeeding. - I never started. - Oh. Why not? I didn't want my boobs to get destroyed. Fair enough. So you are clearly back to having regular menstrual cycles, correct? - Yes. - All right. We're good to go, then. Yeah, okay, thank you. Hi, I'm Melissa Nelson, this is my husband, Caleb. Um, we have an 11:00 a.m. with Dr. Emerson. So, if we go with an egg donor, it's kind of like we're having a baby with someone else, right? Uh, genetically, yes. Biologically, the baby is yours. You're the one carrying it to term. You'll have plenty of time to bond with the baby, feel it kick, all that good stuff. So, what do you do for a living? I work for Edgemont Hotels, front desk. Oh, okay. I write for kids' shows on TV. Saturday morning animation, cartoons. Good. The reason I ask is, uh, this egg donation process, - it's not cheap. - We know. Okay. - Count down from ten. - Ten, nine, eight, seven... Okay, we're all done. Really? Wow. That was it, that was so fast. So much faster than I was expecting. Bed rest for 48 hours. No operating any forklifts or any other heavy machinery. Thank you. You're a great doctor. Well, tell me that in two weeks after you take your pregnancy test. I got something for ya. - From the egg donation. - Eight thousand dollars? We owe you rent. - What? - Your boyfriend owes me rent, not you, keep that for yourself. And don't you dare tell him about it, you hear me? Okay. Good for you. Proud of you. - Thank you. - You're welcome, come on. Let's go inside, keep that hidden. Got it. Hey, babe! You okay? What's the matter? I'm gonna do some Hamburger Helper. - You want some? - So sorry. I'm so, so sorry. What are you sorry about? Where's Abbie? - She's gone. - Huh? I fell asleep, and I woke up and she wasn't breathing. I fell asleep on top of her. She's dead. - Oh, God. - What? What?! What? What do you mean? This is why the babies are supposed to sleep in the crib, you idiot! - Where is she? - She's in the back yard. I buried her. Where is she? Where is she? Oh my God, Abbie! Abbie! Abbie, no! No, no, no! No! Abbie! - No! - I'm so sorry. No! How could you do this? How could you do this? - How could you do this? - I'm sorry! Let go of me, let go of me! - Ah! - Ow! I'm sorry. Stop! Aggh! Stop it. Baby... Babe. Can't you see I feel terrible? At that moment in time, I lost all control. It's as if I suddenly became a completely different person. They say when you go through trauma, your survival mechanisms kick in and you choose what you want to remember. Maybe that's why I don't recall everything as clearly as I should. Oh. You have been through it, haven't you? Other people got it worse, right? So, what did you do to earn your spot in this lovely establishment? I used my degree in computer science to quietly withdraw a few million dollars from a couple banks on Wall Street. The only problem was the FBI didn't exactly approve my transactions. Yeah, you should've asked permission first. What were you thinking? I'm Taylor. Veronica. Nice to meet you. - When are you getting out? - Next month. You? - This weekend. - Nice. Can we play another game? All right, just one more round, but that is it because you... Wait, shh, listen. Dad's home. Hurry, let's do the sleeping game. Sleeping game, let's go. Hmm. Looks like my wife and daughter are completely asleep. I guess I'll have to eat this entire chocolate cake all by myself. Whoa! Chocolate cake? Ha! You're not asleep. Where's the cake? You said there was cake. I don't have cake, but if you got your chores done, I'll take you girls to Yogurt World. I'm gonna go clean my room right now. Hey, babe. How'd it go? Eh, I don't know. He said they don't need any more staff writers, but I could pitch them some ideas for free, of course. Same old crap. I have some good news. Oh, yeah? Corporate office called, and they want to talk about bringing me on as regional manager! How many hotels are we talking about? Eighteen spread across nine states. That's incredible. I know. I'd be on the road... a lot. Hi, babe. Give me a hug. - You hungry? - Yeah. I'm working the late shift tonight, so I probably won't see you till midnight. So what's next? What are you gonna do with yourself? Get a job? Gonna get married? What? I'm going to be a mother again. - Yeah? - Mm. Who with? Okay, here it is. I want to find the married couple who got my eggs. You think you can do that? Girl, when I was a sophomore in college, I hacked into the Pentagon just because I thought it would be fun. Step aside. Take notes. Bada-bing, bada-boom. Found it! There they are. And holy crap, that is not you. - No, that was me. - Ugh, I don't even recognize you. - You look awful. - What's all that about? Uh, basically it says that your eggs had one successful implantation and that the baby's gender is... - Boy or girl? - I'm not gonna say. Tell me. It's a girl. I need their address. Okay, Ruby! Bedtime! Okay! Hey, how about this weekend, you and I go to the park, spend the whole day there? Can we go to the waterslide instead? Not this weekend. We can do the waterslide another time. Okay. Goodnight, sweetie. Goodnight, Mom. Mom. Kimberly. I could be a Kimberly. Ready? Oh! That was a good one. Thank you. Okay, let's get a drink. Oh. It's so hot today. Mom, look! Help! Park ranger! Fire! Okay, stay next to me. Okay. I'm gonna call the fire department. Uh, yes, I'm in Omo Lane Park. Um, a trash can is burning all of a sudden, and I'm afraid it's gonna catch the trees above it on fire. Someone just got a fire extinguisher from their car. Yes, thank you. Okay. Whoa, that was a close one. What if the whole park caught on fire? I know, it could've. Ruby, careful on those ropes, sweetie! Okay! Whoa, you got up those fast. Hi, I'm Kimberly. - What's your name? - Ruby. Hi, Ruby. You're a good climber. Well, my mom doesn't like when I climb real high. She's scared I'm gonna fall. You're not gonna fall. Besides, I'll catch ya. I'm a nanny, I bring my kids to this park all the time. Hey, if you like heights, did you know that this park has a hiking trail? - Really? - Yeah. It goes up that hill there. You can see all the way to downtown. Want me to show you? It's a short walk. You'll be back in five minutes. Okay, I'm gonna go tell my mom. Okay. I'm gonna go up this hiking trail with this nice lady. I'll be right back. - Mom? - You know, it's so clear out today, we can probably see the ocean from up there. - The ocean? Really? - Mm-hm. Let's go, come on. Ocean and mountains for me. - I love the ocean too. - You do? Ruby? Ruby! - Hey, babe, what's up? - Is Ruby with you? Do you have her? Why would I have her? I thought she was with you. No, she's not. I'm at the park, and... she must have wandered off, I guess. I don't know where she is. - Then call her. - I can't. I... she left her cellphone with me. Ruby! I can't find her, I'm freaking out. You didn't see where she went? No, I fell asleep. Okay, okay, don't panic. I'm on my way over there right now and we'll find her. I'm gonna call the police. Wait, wait. She's here, she's home. - She's okay. - I'll be home in a sec. Hi, you must be Mr. Nelson. Kimberly Barrington. I found your daughter at the park. - What happened? - Well, it's... it's a big park and she got lost. I didn't get lost. I went to the top of the hill. It was so cool, Dad! I saw Catalina Island! That's great, honey, but your mom and I were worried. Please, come in. Mm, smells good. - What'd you get? - Kimberly took me to Nicky's Burgers, but don't tell Mom. She hates Nicky's Burgers. Thank you. - We were so worried. - No problem. She's a great kid. - Here, let me pay you. - No, please, I wouldn't dream of it. - I insist. - Absolutely not. But, hey, if you ever need someone to look after Ruby when you're too busy, I happen to be a nanny. I have a résumé in the car. Really? I'll keep that in mind. - Where's your trash? - Under the sink right there. - Hey, babe. - Where is she? Oh, are you okay? I am incredible. I had an amazing day. - Who are you? - This is Kimberly. She found Ruby, drove her home. Drove her home... I was in the park the whole time. Why didn't you just bring her back to me? You were sleeping, Mom. That does not give you an excuse to wander off. We've talked about this, Ruby. I tried to wake you. What did we agree on? I'm not supposed to wander off. And you are not supposed to talk to strangers. Um, no offense, I'm sorry, what is your name again? - Kimberly. - Okay, no offense, Kimberly, but you have no business bringing strange children inside your car for any reason. Babe, she's a nanny. I don't care if she's Mother Teresa. And you do not ever get inside the car of someone that we do not know. Do you hear me? It's okay. Everything's fine, babe. Um, forgive me. I'm just a little on edge. I just went through a mother's worst nightmare. I completely understand. I'm sorry. I was only trying to help. I'll never do that again. Well, regardless, thank you for getting her home safely. You look familiar. Have we met before? Not that I know of. Guess not. Okay, well, um... Thank you. Please allow me to start over. I'm Melissa Nelson, Ruby's mom. Hi, Ruby's mom. You have an incredible daughter. Thanks for the résumé. - I'll talk it over with her. - Great. I hope we can work something out. - Have a good night. - You too. Did she put her hands on you in any way? What do you mean? Did she touch your boobies or your private parts? Ew! Ew, ew, ew! This is serious, Ruby. I need you to be honest with me. She didn't! She was really nice. What did you girls talk about? I don't know. School, sports. I told her I like science and volleyball. She said those were her favorites, too. Whose idea was it to go to Nicky's Burgers? Hers, not mine, I swear. She ordered first. And guess what? She ordered exactly what I always get. - Really? - It was so weird, Mom. She likes everything I like. It's like she already knows me. Well... I'm just glad you got home safe. And I'm sorry I shouted at you. To bed. Okay, all right. I'll get your jammies. Two hours? How do you fall asleep in the park for two hours? I don't know, it just happened. If you were so tired today, why'd you take her to the park in the first place? Something came over me. Probably something I ate. Well, that kind of thing can't happen again. No kidding. If I didn't have to work so many hours during the week, maybe I'd have a little more energy - on the weekends. - What are you implying? I'm just saying that I can't work full-time for Edgemont Hotels and also be a full-time mom. I'm exhausted and I need some help. So today was all my fault 'cause I'm not making - any money right now? - I didn't say that. You fall asleep in the park, our daughter's picture almost ends up on the milk carton, but I'm the bad guy because no one in children's television wants to hire me to write for them? - I love your logic. - I'm not talking about the money. I'm talking about helping me with Ruby. Hold that thought. You're getting bumped up to regional manager, so you're gonna be on the road an awful lot. I'll be here at the house, and I have a ton of pitches I need to write and concentrate on, so I'll be the one needing help with Ruby. I say we get a nanny. Let's hire this woman. I'm okay with the idea of hiring a nanny, but not her. It's just too weird what happened today. What happened today was our ten-year-old daughter was left unsupervised in the city park for two hours, and this good Samaritan went out of her way to protect her and bring her home safely. She didn't even let me pay for her dinner. And best of all, Ruby actually likes her. They get along great. Before I even consider this, we have to thoroughly check her out. I'll contact all her references, and I'll do background checks, criminal and credit. What do you think? - I think you're hired. - Really? Thank you both so much. We called all your references. Everyone says you're amazing. - When can you start? - Um, tomorrow? Great. Uh, here are our house keys along with any phone numbers you might need. Excuse me, I'm gonna go get the princess right now. Um, there's also a prepaid credit card with a hundred dollars on it just in case Ruby needs anything. You've thought of everything. I hope so, this is all new to us. - Ruby, you remember Kimberly. - Uh, yeah. Well, she's gonna be helping us out around here. Are you gonna be my nanny? Yeah, she is. Isn't that exciting? Yay! I'm so happy! Thank you! I want to show you my room, come on! I guess I'll be right back. Take your time, have fun. Would you look at that? Ruby loves Kimberly so much. This is gonna be great. - I got a job. - Oh! You scared me. - When did you get home? - Just now. Great news. As of tomorrow, I am officially a nanny. A nanny? You got a prison record. Who's gonna hire you to be their nanny? Her family, they're very nice. Okay, you lost me. "Her family." Whose family are we talking about? Abbie's family. Oh, I mean, Ruby... Ruby's family. Her name is Ruby. She's ten years old now. And, Mom, she is so beautiful. - Start over. - The family who bought my eggs ten years ago, I found them. I met my daughter. You... tracked them down? We hit it off, like we were best friends. I told them my situation, offered to be their nanny, and they love the idea. I'm going to make a bunch of money, I get to hang out with my daughter, and I must admit, the husband is kind of cute, too. - It's perfect! - She's not your daughter. You told them you were their egg donor, right? Of course. They really want Ruby to know me, so it's all transparent. They're totally woke. Honey, when you donated your eggs, you signed a deal. You agreed not to have any contact with the recipient family, remember? And they agreed to the same thing, but that was ten years ago, and they don't care about some stupid piece of paper they signed. Why are you doing this? You could've gotten a job anywhere in town. - Why them? - Because she is my flesh and blood. Okay, she's the only family I've got. Excuse me, what am I? I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way. It's just... Look, this is important to me. I thought you would be happy that I found a job. Next time, I won't tell you anything. I don't like this. It smells bad. Then forget I mentioned it. - I can't. - Yes, you can! In fact, why don't you do what you've done my entire life, Mom? Why don't you just ignore me? Oh, it's worked wonders so far, so why change a good thing? - Hi, can I help you? - Hi, I'm Jamal. Is Melissa ready to go? Come on in. I am almost ready. Caleb, come say hi to Jamal. Hi, I'm Kimberly. Can I get you something to drink? I'm fine, thanks. Jamal, this is my husband, Caleb. - Hey, how's it going? - Good. And, Caleb, say hello to Mr. Jamal Jones, - my incredible boss. - It's nice to meet you. Okay, I am almost ready. Give me two minutes. Come on in. So, this is the big tour, huh? Yeah, Melissa is our new regional manger, so we got to introduce her to the staff at all the hotels. Ah, how many cities are you going to? - She started to tell me... - Let's see, today we do Denver. Big party there. Then we fly over to Houston. Even bigger party. Wait. Parties. I thought they were meetings. Well, yeah, we have a meeting, but there's always a big party afterward. Great dinner, full bar, live music, dancing. Basically, the hotel employees use these new management introductions as a giant excuse to just let loose and get wild. - Melissa, am I right? - You're right about that. They are so crazy. Don't forget to bring your bathing suit! Already packed it! After Houston, we do Memphis, slide into Chicago, zip on over to Dallas for a quickie, then we bang it out in San Francisco. They're gonna do fireworks over the Golden Gate. Huge climax, gonna be awesome. Sounds great. Ready? - Are we gonna miss the flight? - No, we're good. Wish me luck. Nice to meet you, Caleb, and... - Kimberly. I'm the nanny. - Kimberly, right. I'll try to bring her back in one piece. Happy hour? After you. Looks like they're gonna have a lot of fun. What a great job for her. Woo! Again. All right, right here. How 'bout that? Woo! - Ohh! - Yes! Get over here. Oh, you're the best. That was awesome. Whoa, look at that bird. - Is that a hawk? - Yeah. It's a red-tailed hawk. - I wish I could fly like that. - You can. We can go hang gliding. My mom would never let me do that. - Why not? - She would say it's too dangerous. You know, if I was your mom and you told me you wanted to do something really bad, I'd let you do it. Thanks, but you're not my mom. You sure I'm not your mom? Some kids have two moms. - Did you know that? - Yeah. Like with my friends, when their mommies and daddies fight, sometimes they get a new mommy or a new daddy. Well, that's not what I mean. Some kids have their legal mom and their second mom. It's their biological mom, their flesh-and-blood mom. Can I trust you to keep a secret? Yeah. - Promise? - Promise. What is it? You have two moms. - I do? - Yup. And guess who your second mom is. Who? Me. - Really? - Yeah. But you can't tell anybody. You promised. How are you my second mom? I'll explain that later. The only thing you need to know is I love you... just as much as Melissa does. Maybe even more. And if you want to go hang gliding someday, fly high up in the sky like a red-tailed hawk, I'll not only take you... I'll go flying up there with you. - How was the trip? - Amazing. We had such a great time. Is there anything going on I should know about? - What do you mean? - You and Jamal, the way you act when you're around him. You've got to be kidding. The way he opens your car door, the way you guys laugh it up about all your late-night parties, the drinking. "Don't forget your bathing suit." I'm not interested in Jamal. Did anything happen on the trip? Did he cross the line? Not in the least. Okay. Um, this one moment on the plane, he said I looked great and you are a very lucky man. Bam, see? There it is. You should take it as a compliment. No, I'm gonna take it for what it is. This guy is so good-looking. He looks like a magazine model. And I bet you he couldn't wait to give you this job so he could take you around the country, party it up with you, and get you in bed. Nothing happened. Nothing is going on with me and Jamal! So then why are you so happy all of a sudden? What is with this bubbly attitude - you're coming home with? - Because I love my new job. I'm in charge of something for the first time in my life. I'm making decisions, I know what I'm doing, and people respect what I have to say. Do you have any idea how that feels for me? I'm sorry. I guess I got the wrong impression. You did. But I got to admit... You are kind of cute when you're jealous. Okay, we will be at the Edgemont Laguna Niguel. Laguna Niguel. Ooh, sounds like a romantic getaway for the married couple. It's only been 11 years since our honeymoon. And it's comped, so why not? We will be back Sunday afternoon. Uh, and there is a frozen lasagna in the freezer that you can heat up, - and I made a salad. - Oh, I was going to do my pesto salmon and broccoli. She's ten, she's not gonna eat salmon. I love Kimberly's salmon. Please, Mom? Okay, well, that's news to me. Saturday at 2:00, she has a birthday party at a friend's house. Um, she wants to wear the pink dress with the frilly pattern. I laid it out. Do you like that pink dress? I hate that pink dress. - Since when? - It's a kid's party. I was thinking jeans and a T-shirt? Jeans and a T-shirt. And, then, on Sunday, I was gonna take her to Six Flags. Oh, she gets sick on roller coasters. I love roller coasters. Six Flags, let's do it. How come everything I suggest you don't want to do, but everything Kimberly suggests, you love? I don't know, I guess Kimberly knows me better than you do. We got to go or we're gonna hit traffic. - Bye, sweetie. - Bye, Dad. Bye, baby. - Have fun at the party. - I will. Have fun. How was Laguna? Oh, great. We needed it. Can I talk to you? In private. Ruby's at school and Melissa's at work, so we're the only ones here. What I meant was... Can you keep a secret? Of course. What is it? Last Thursday when you were at the gym, I was cleaning up the kitchen, and Melissa had left her cellphone on the counter. I know it's not cool to read through somebody's text messages, but the app was open, so... What did you read? Can you promise me you won't tell her - I told you this? - I promise. She was chatting with Jamal Jones. She wrote "I want to get wild with you," and she said to meet her at a hotel, said she would reserve a room for them. Do you remember which hotel or when they planned to meet? I... I don't want to tell you. I'm worried you might do something bad. Kimberly, you came to me with this. Please. Wurlington Hotel. Today. At 3:00. Hello, welcome to the Wurlington. - How can I help you? - Uh, yes, I'm here to meet Melissa Nelson. I believe she checked in already. Do you know what room? I don't. Could you look? Give me one moment. We have a reservation under Ms. Nelson for Room 702, but she hasn't checked in. Thanks. I'll wait for her. You're welcome to hang out at the bar. - I'm fine. - It's happy hour. Hello, welcome to the Wurlington. - How may I be of service? - Yes, I'm meeting a friend. Melissa Nelson, has she checked in? Um, Ms. Nelson hasn't checked in yet, but you can hang out at the bar if... Jamal Jones. What are you doing here? Caleb... hey. Just came here to check out the competition, you know, Edgemont Hotels, we're, like, the chain. - Big rivalry going on for years. - Yeah. I heard what you said to her. I was sitting right over there. Are you having sex with my wife? Dude, no, that is not what's going on here. Security, security to the front desk! Look, man, just please, let me explain. God. Nothing has happened, okay? Nothing's happening. We haven't done anything. Yeah, but you were planning on it, weren't you? Okay, yes, we were going to, but today would've been the first time... Stop, stop, now, whoa, Melissa texted me! Hey, she set this up. I just got here, we didn't do anything yet. What about those trips you guys went on? - All those parties you went to? - I swear, man, nothing has happened between me and your wife. Hey, handsome, how's your day? Hi. - It was illuminating. - Where's Ruby? Kimberly took her to Nicky's Burgers. What'd you do to your hand? Eh, bumped into some garbage. - How was your day? - Long. These meetings are never-ending, but it was terrific. Wow. You're very good. Good at what? Uh... I stayed in the lobby until 5:00 p.m. waiting for you to show up. I'm guessing Jamal called you and warned you not to come. Honey, what are you talking about? I got an anonymous tip today from someone you work with. This person told me they found out you were planning to hook up with Jamal Jones at Hotel Wurlington at 3:00. - What? - So I drove down there. Sure enough, you'd booked a room. Jamal showed up and confessed to everything. "Everything," what do you mean "everything"? You're having an affair with your boss! Or at least you're trying to. And Jamal told me how you texted him - and set it all up! - This is crazy, - I didn't do that. - Fine. Tell that to Jamal Jones. Tell that to the front desk at the Hotel Wurlington. They took your reservation and everything! - Have you lost your mind? - Don't try and deny it. Do I look like an idiot? Who is this anonymous-tip person? Who told you this, you said I work with him? I'm not at liberty to say. Look. I get it. You been spending a lot of time on the road with Jamal and he's handed you this wonderful new career, so it's no surprise you've fallen in love with him. I am not in love with Jamal Jones and I'm getting sick and tired of you accusing me of it! Well, I'm sick and tired of playing the fool! God. I think we need a break, figure things out. - A break? - Yeah, a separation. I'll be sleeping in my office until you start telling the truth. The truth is, you are completely delusional! Show me this text message I supposedly sent you. Uh, I deleted it. I wasn't gonna keep that around. I did not send you a text asking for a hook-up. Somebody did. Somebody reserved a room in your name, too. It's just so stupid, because if we were gonna have an affair, we would've had one already, like, in Memphis or somewhere. Well, Memphis, no. The beds at that hotel are too soft. Denver. I'd definitely have an affair with you - at the Denver location. - Jamal! Sorry. How's Caleb? Is he still upset at me? I gotta send him an apology, you know, Laker tickets or something. Yeah, good luck. He's not talking to me, so, doubt he'll talk to you. Look. Whoever did this, it's probably somebody at the company who's pissed at me for promoting you. If they can make it look like I was playing favorites, I could get fired... fast. Maybe. All I know is my marriage is in total jeopardy right now, thanks to whoever did this. Maybe that's another way to look at it. Who would wanna ruin your marriage? I have no clue. - Hey, good morning, how are you? - Thank you. Did you tell her that it was me? Of course not, I promised you I wouldn't. How long will she be gone? About a week. Would it be all right if I stayed here at night - while she's gone? - Uh... My car has been acting up. It's a long drive back and forth to my place. I can sleep on the couch. Sure. Why not? Great. Thanks. You will not regret it. Hi. Remember me? Yes. What do you want? - Is Caleb here? - He's busy. I'd like to give him this. There's two Lakers tickets in here. - I just thought that he might... - He doesn't want them. Why do you say that? I know all about you and what happened the other day. I thought you were just the nanny. Why would you know about that? Who told you? - Caleb. - Well... could you at least give him this for me as a peace offering? All I know is my marriage is in total jeopardy right now, thanks to whoever did this. Who would wanna ruin your marriage? Why would you know about that? Who told you? Caleb. I'm gonna go to my house, pack up some clothes, my toothbrush. Do you need me to get you anything while I'm out? No, I'm good, just make sure you're back by the time Ruby gets home from school. Oh, yeah, okay, I'll make it quick. Okay. Hi, Mom. I know you're doing a double shift at work today and you can't answer, but I'm gonna be staying with the Nelsons for a couple days, so don't freak out when you get home at midnight and I'm not here. Bye. - Hey, Kimberly, what's up? - Hey, I went to my house, packed up everything, then as I was driving back to your place, I realized I forgot to pack my computer. Uh-oh, can't do anything in life without our computers. I'm gonna go back to my place and get it, so I'm guessing I'll be about 15 minutes late. Okay. Gotcha. Let me guess. You wanna have sex with me at a hotel. - What are you doing in here? - You are the one who sent me that text, aren't you? You pretended you were Melissa and you set us both up, didn't you? - Get out of my house. - And if I don't, what are you gonna do, call the cops? Please. Go ahead. I'll be more than happy to show them the computer you stole from the fertility clinic, Taylor Thompson. That's right, I know exactly who you are. You're Melissa's egg donor. But Melissa and Caleb have no clue who you are because you changed your name and you look completely different than you did 10 years ago. I figured out your little game. You think Ruby's your daughter and you want her all to yourself, don't you? - She is my daughter. - You're trying to get Melissa out of the picture so you can start sleeping with Caleb. That is, unless you're not doing so already. You're hoping that Caleb will marry you, and then you sign a few adoption papers and you become Ruby's legal mother. That's your plan, isn't it... Taylor? Who are you calling? Uh, hi, I'm, uh, 10 minutes from LAX. I... I'm running a little late, but I don't think I'll miss my flight. - Everything okay? - Everything's great. I got something for ya, something you're really gonna love. - You do? - Yep. Guess what I'm doing right now? I don't know, what are you doing right now? Hello, are you okay? Jamal, what are you doing? Uggh! Stop, stop, stop! Are you doing what I think you're doing? I know that we're friends and sometimes we discuss matters of the heart, and yeah, okay, on one occasion, I did compliment you on how handsome you look. But that was not an invitation for anything further. Powerful men like you have been exploiting women in the workplace for way too long. You have a company-wide reputation as a player, so what you're doing right now doesn't surprise me. Maybe you were the one behind the whole hotel hook-up thing. - Just stop, stop, stop... - I'm reporting you to Human Resources and I will be filing a formal report with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing. You have a good day. Mine! Get it... ready, Ruby? This is for you. - Yes! - Yay! - We won, we won, we won! - We won, we won! Kimberly's doing a wonderful job. You don't have to worry about her. Ruby's fine, I already told you that. Look, it's... I'm still not ready to discuss it. I need more time. I don't know how much more time. I'll see you when you get back. - What's the news? - Her boss, Jamal Jones, the guy she's having an affair with, he's missing. - Missing? - Yeah, nobody knows where he is. And because of that, Corporate is giving Melissa a bunch of his work, so she'll be on the road even longer. - How is she doing? - Not good. Could you hear her crying on the phone? - Uh-uh. - She still denies the whole thing. Breaks my heart to hear the woman I love suffering like that. May I speak candidly? Have you ever not spoken candidly? I think she's manipulating you. She clearly had an affair with that guy. I mean, look at him, he's gorgeous, he's wealthy, I... I know. Find me a woman who wouldn't wanna sleep with that guy. I wouldn't. If you were my husband, I... I wouldn't wanna look at another man. I would make you so happy, and I sure wouldn't leave my daughter for weeks at a time. I... I'm sorry. I... I shouldn't have said that. It's just, um, working with you every day, I... I've started to, uh, feel, um... You're so handsome. I only wanted you to know how wonderful you are. - Good night. - Good night. Ugh, Jesus! Ugh! Ugh! Who's the dead guy in the damn garage? Oh, my God, let me explain. - He was a burglar. - Uh-huh. I walked in, I surprised him, and he had a heart attack right on the spot. - Really? - And I didn't know what to do, - so I put him in the garage. - Seriously? I was gonna call the coroner, but I didn't know what to say. That is a truckload of crap and you know it. Stop lying to me, I am sick of it! You're lying about the egg donor family and you're lying about this! Now, why did you kill him? - I didn't kill him. - Yes, you did. You killed him just like you killed your own baby. What? I didn't kill my baby. Derek fell asleep on her by accident. He smothered her. Is that the story you've been telling people? It's not a story, it's the truth. I can't believe this. You been telling that lie for so long, you actually believe it, you... You've convinced yourself you didn't do it. Taylor. You killed your baby. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. I remember it like it was yesterday. God, be quiet, be quiet, ugh! Okay, okay. Oh my God. I can't take it anymore! I cannot take it anymore! Oh, my God, shut up! Shut up, shut up, shut up! Shut up! Geez, take it easy on her, would ya? We got some more formula for the little monster. - How's she doing? - Stop it, stop crying! Stop crying, stop crying! Stop, stop crying! Okay. Yeah, okay. Well... aww! All better now, yeah. That sweetie, that's my Abbie. Yeah, aww, that's just... - Abbie? - We tried CPR. It didn't work. She was gone. And that's when Derek lost it. You stupid bitch! You killed our kid! Stop it, stop it! Aggh! No! You stay out of this! Get off of me! You and I decided to tell everybody it was a crib death, and we got away with it, but we couldn't hide the fact that you stabbed your boyfriend. I don't believe you. - That's not what happened. - That is exactly what happened. You need help, honey. No, Mother, I'm fine! You're looking after someone's little girl. What happens if she misbehaves and you lose it like you did with Abbie, what if you hurt her? I love her! That's not going to happen! I'm sorry, but I'm calling the police, and you're gonna tell 'em the truth about the stinky dude in the garage. Please, Mom... Mom, don't! - I'm okay, I'm okay! - You are not okay, Taylor! - Now, give me the phone! - No, don't call them! Give me the phone, Taylor! Taylor, uggh, don't do it! I need to be with Abbie! Why do you do this? You shouldn't make up stories, Mother. Okay, yard work time. Let's go, you can watch your Daddy's cartoons later. Come on, we can team up. I'll trim the hedges, you can rake. It'll be fun. Kimberly never makes me do yard work. - Kimberly's not your mother. - Yes, she is. What'd you say? Nothing. You said Kimberly's your mom. What makes you say that? It hurts my feelings when you say things like that, Ruby. Why did you say that? Ruby. Kimberly said that some kids have two moms. Some kids do, but... you don't. - What else did she say? - She said that some kids have a legal mom and their second mom is their biological mom, their flesh-and-blood mom. Kimberly said she was my second mom. Kimberly is our egg donor, Taylor Thompson. - Wait, wait, slow down... who? - Kimberly is our egg donor from 10 years ago, different hair, different look, but that's her. I thought she looked familiar, I can't believe I missed it. Whoa, that's Kimberly? Wouldn't have even recognized her. She told Ruby that she was her second mom. I mean, who knows what else she's been doing all this time? - What? - She's the one who told me about the hotel thing with Jamal. That's it. That's her plan... she wants to get me out of the picture so she can be Ruby's only mom. That's not all. She came on to me big time. Nothing happened. Huh, wow! She really does want me out of the picture. I'm sorry for how I reacted. - I should've trusted you. - Yeah. You should've. That's far enough. You're not coming in the house. What's going on? We know who you are, Taylor. We know what you're trying to do, it's over. Wait, hold on, please let me explain. We're filing for a restraining order. You are not coming near Ruby ever again. - You understand? - Please. - Please don't do that. - You pretended to be someone else to get this job and we trusted you. Forget it, you're gone. Now, get off our property before we call the police. Why are you treating me this way? Haven't I been good to Ruby? Go. Get the hell out of here. I just wanna be a friend to my own flesh and blood. You as a mother should understand how important that is to a woman. Okay, that's it, I'm calling the cops. All right, fine, I'm leaving. I love Ruby. I love her so much. She means everything to me. Dammit! Ruby's mine, mine, mine! Okay. Give me your phone. I'm blocking her number, you are not to talk to her. We're getting you a new cell phone number as soon as possible... Meantime, if she tries to contact you in any way, you tell us. On Monday, you're not taking the bus to school, one of us will take you, and after school, you wait in the front office for one of us to come and get you. When you're not in school, you will never be alone. One of us will be with you at all times. Do you have any questions? Is it okay if... I say goodbye to her? - No! - But Kimberly was my friend! Her name is not Kimberly and she's not your friend. - What's her name? - You don't need - to know her name. - But we had so much fun, Mom. - She was so nice to me! - Ruby, you are not listening. You are not to have any contact with her, okay? She is dangerous, do you understand? I'm sorry. I did not mean to shout at you. Look, we know this is gonna be difficult for you, but it's for your own good. Let's get some sleep, huh? It's been a tough day. Good night, sweetheart. I love you. Okay, wish me luck. Good luck. They are gonna love your story ideas. Yeah, from your mouth to the head of the studio. I gotta run, traffic's gonna be a nightmare. Babe, it's Saturday. That's right. - I love you. - I love you. Hi, Ruby, hi, sweetie. I'm not supposed to talk to you. I know, I just wanna see you one last time, so I can say goodbye properly, - and I have a gift for you. - A gift? Do you think you could come outside and meet me? Just you by... by yourself. I'm out front in my car, it'll just take a minute. Okay, I'm coming. Yes! Hey, Ruby, when you're done with your homework do you wanna play a game with me? Do you wanna play Medieval Magic or Rocket Universe? Get in here and give me a hug. My parents said I wasn't supposed to get in your car. Ruby, it's... it's me. We're best friends, I'm your second mom. Do you really think I'm going to hurt you? No. Which one of those games do you like best? - What's your real name? - Taylor. My name is Taylor. That's a cool name for a girl. Ruby! Come on, get in the car. - You said you had a gift for me? - I do, it's at my place, it's a surprise. Come on, I'll show you. It's really close by. You'll be back in five minutes. You can give me five minutes, can't you? Please? This may be the last time I ever see you. Ruby, this isn't funny! Ruby! Hey, babe, I'm just getting to their offices. - What's up? - Taylor just kidnapped Ruby. - What? - I looked out the front door and I saw Ruby getting into Taylor's car and they drove off. I'm in my car, I'm on the road, and I'm looking for them. - How could you let this happen? - Ruby snuck out the window. I didn't even know she was gone. Wait. There they are, I see them. Okay, I'm coming now. Don't try and stop her. - That would set her off. - I won't, I'm just gonna follow them to wherever they're going. Good. Where are you now? On Roscoe Boulevard passing Sherman Way - heading east. - Okay, I'll start heading in that direction now. So you keep saying you're my second mom, but you never told me why. Well, did your parents ever tell you where babies come from? Oh no, this is so embarrassing! Basically you... you need a sperm and an egg to make a baby. Daddies provide the sperm, mommies provide the egg, but for some reason Melissa couldn't make an egg, so your mom and dad used my egg, and together, we all three made you. That is why I'm your second mom. Okay, so if you're one third of the reason I was born, then why don't my mom and dad want me to hang out with you? I don't know. All I know is it breaks my heart. - What's happening? - Uh, they stopped at a house on a dirt road, I'm parked outside. Uh, here's the address: 18745 Leona Drive. - Got it. - Okay, uh, you call the police. I'm gonna try to sneak into the house - and get Ruby out of there. - No, don't do that. - Just wait for me. - I'm doing it. - I'll see you when you get here. - Babe! Wait! Sit down. Okay, this is your gift I promised you. - It's a video. - A video? Yeah, it's short. You watch this while I do some work in the other room, - and then we'll go. - Okay. Egg donation is a process in which a fertile woman donates an egg, or ovocyte, to another woman to help her conceive. Do you know the identity of the kidnapper? Yes, she's our nanny... I mean, she was our nanny, but not anymore. She's actually our egg donor from 10 years ago. Is she the biological mother of your daughter? - Partly, yes. - Does she have a legal right to spend time with your daughter? No, look... Can you send a patrol car or not? Sir, we are understaffed at the moment. Before I send a patrol car to a location, I must have a valid reason to do so, and right now, you're not giving me one. The procedure typically involves a doctor removing eggs from the donor... fertilizing them in a laboratory, and then transferring the resulting embryos into the recipient's uterus. Ruby? No! Okay, see you when you get here. At the facility may freeze some or all... Ruby! Ruby, Ruby, untie me, please. Don't, don't do what she says. Unlock the door, baby, let me in. She's crazy. Look what she did to me. She tried to kill me. Don't listen to her, unlock the door, let me in! I love you so much. Please, untie me. - Ruby, let me in! - Don't open the door. She's gonna come back in here and she's gonna kill me. Whatever you do, don't open the door. Don't do what she says, she's not your mother! See how she lies? You saw the video, my egg created you. I am your mother! Go out front and wait for Dad, okay? Mom! No, Mom! No! - No! - Stop it, shut up! Stop crying! - You killed our kid! - I cannot take it anymore! Shut up, shut up! Abbie? Oh, God. Ruby... Abbie... What have I done? Oh, my God. Where's Ruby? Melissa! Where are they? I killed them. I killed my baby. I killed Abbie. I don't deserve to walk this earth. Baby, baby, baby, come on, baby, baby. Are you okay? Can you hear me? Baby. Ruby? Ruby! Baby, oh, my God. Ruby! Check her pulse. She's dead. I'm okay. I was just playing the sleeping game! Oh, thank God. Oh, baby. Mommy, Mommy, wake up. Abbie? Abbie, I am so sorry. I love you, Mommy. I love you too.
