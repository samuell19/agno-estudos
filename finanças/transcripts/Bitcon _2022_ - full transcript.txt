What will happen to it? What will it be used for? What can money be used for anyway? This is one of the most common ways in which we all use money as a medium of exchange for goods.

I can limp off into the shadows and disappear. But they know where my family lives. I could call the cops and well, that wouldn't work. Or I could put an ear to the ground and try to find a hard drive in a haystack. The good news is that almost everyone has a hustle these days. Won't hurt to roll the dice. Hey, Andy good to see you. Shouldn't be talking to you. Why? You went away. A lot of people started getting picked u Everyone thinks you flipped. Nah, Andy that wasn't me. You alright? Yeah, I'm Fine. Okay. I got hired to find something. A hard drive. Hear anything? Dude, 90% of my gig is buying copper off meth heads. No one bringing me computer peripherals. Crew did a job last night.

Would you now say I'm not a legitimate criminal? [ Snap ] [ Crank noise ] [ gasping, coughing ] Ty. I'm the guy that started the rumor. [ Gasp ] Why would he do that?!
