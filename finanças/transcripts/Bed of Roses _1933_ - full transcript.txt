You know, I don't know what the world would do without art. Art who? - Just plain art. Pictures like this. "The Marines have landed." "A sailor's delight." "A travelling salesman's passion." "Why young girls go home at 9 o'clock." Well, here goes. You didn't tear up that sailor, did you? - You can have him. He's not my type. Where? The Pacific Ocean. - Alright Lorry, come along. Well, Madge, you're the swell-est cell-mate I ever had. If you're ever in New Orleans, drop in and see me at my molasses factory. I'll do that if I get out in time. This is a very nice institution you have here, Miss Mumsy. But you do cater to rather a low class. The State of Louisiana punished you for the infraction of one of its laws. It has however, no personal feeling against you .. And hopes that in the future you will lead a better life. Mrs Howard, here is your jewellery and your earnings for the past six months. I don't expect to see you here again. Millie Brown. I'll give you the same advice. You are much too impulsive. I'm telling you, Mrs Webster. I ain't got an impulse left. Well, that's fine. Lorry Evans. In the past you've been incorrigible. Are you still talking for Louisiana or is that crack personal? As head Matron of this institution and with all my experience I have never .. You win. Save your wind. You might want to go sailing sometime. Alright, girls. Come along. Hello there, honey. - Hello. Where'd you get them clothes? Some woman done give them to you? No. I won these clothes shooting craps. You do any playing round I'll do a thing to you that'll put me back here to stay. Well here we are, free again. Yep. Not a worry on our mind except a place to eat and a place to sleep. Well, I know how to get back in again. I just got to hit the guard with a rock. No thanks, I've had enough. Let's see if we can't shag a ride. Hello Laurie. - Oh. Hello, Father. This is Minnie. - Hello Minnie. How do you do. [ Whistle ] Hey, big boy. Is this your boat? - Who wants to know? How about paddling a couple of girls down to the dock? Well, make me an offer. Glad to see you out, Lorry. Yeah. It's okay with me too. Are you .. are you going to New Orleans? I guess so. I've found a nice job for you there if you'll take it. Yeah? What doing? Why, it is a sort of a governess with a fine family. No thanks. I can't see much future in changing diapers. Well, what do you intend to do? I got some ideas. I did a lot of thinking in that joint. I found the only difference between me and women seen riding round in yachts .. Is they use their heads. And believe me, I'm using mine from now on. Now, do you think that is a nice attitude for you to start out with? Don't worry. If the finish is okay I can always write a check to cover the start. Let me drive you down to the boat. I'd like to talk with you further. Well. No, thank you. If I listen to you much longer you might reform me. I got all the reforming I wanted in there. You sure there won't be any regrets later? Not with me. I can take my regrets or leave them alone. Anyhow, you're a good sort and I like you. Toodle-oo and thanks for trying. Oh say, I just made all the arrangements to get drove down to the boat. Oh, are you a good chauffeur? What's the matter with the boyfriend? Paralysed? Oh, he wants me to help him check up on his groceries. [ Fog horn ] Well I've got $12.20. What you got? Outside of this diamond-studded powder puff I've got six bucks. Oh. Wait a minute. Here is two more. Where did you get it? - I found it. Well, we can't get very far on this. If we could get to New Orleans, Elsie would take care of us. She takes care of all the girls. Yeah. "If" is right. How good are you at walking on water? Oh, just fair. I could do a lot of thinking on gin. If I knew where to get some. [ Door knocks ] Entr?. Tickets please. The man wants tickets. How far can we get on twenty bucks? Twenty? Let me see. That would take you as far as Good Hope. I've always wanted to go there. It's a nice place. Yeah. I've heard delightful things about it. Say. Couldn't pay you next week for a trip to New Orleans today, could we? Well. No. You see that's against the company's rules. That's what we thought. Tickets. I hope you have a nice trip. Oh. Say, just a .. My, but it's foggy. Yes it is. Quite foggy. You see, this situation. We're very anxious to get to New Orleans. Now .. I thought maybe .. [ Fog horn ] No hard feelings. [ Fog horn ] How long were you away? - About four months. Four months? Did you have a good time? Take your wife with you? Hello, Steve. Why, how are you, JC? - Fine. - Glad to see you. You know Bannen, don't you? Oh, steward. Yes, ma'am? - Who's the guy in the tan coat? Why that's Steven Paige. He's one of the biggest publishers in New Orleans. Now that's right. How's your wife? - Fine and dandy. [ Fog horn ] Lorry. Open the door, hon. I've got a surprise for you. A couple of guys. Come on in, boys. I want you to meet a friend of mine. Mr Jones, Mr Smith. This is Miss Evans. Hello, Miss Evans. - How do you do. They go to Good Hope too. Ain't that a coincidence. I can hardly believe it. How about that bottle? Sure. - Go ahead, get it. Do you live in Good Hope? - Most of the time. I'm just starting off there to put flowers on grandmother's grave. Is that so? My grandmother is buried there, too. - Well, that's fine. Might as well make a party of it. - Sure, move right in. You'll like Smitty. He's a big cotton man. Yeah, he looks perfectly normal to me. You are some kidder. Have you got a lot of cotton ranches or does it grow on animals? Well, not exactly. You see, we're in a different branch of the business. We are Boll-Weevil exterminators. Don't look at me. I ain't done nothing. Well, here goes. Down the river. Sure, let's have two at a time. Come on, Smitty. Crack on. What's your real name? You won't get sore? I'll try and bear up. Oglethorpe. I know how to exterminate boll-weevils. Why, Mr Oglethorpe. And I tell you something else. I must leave now and my car is outside. Then you'd better lay your body on the bed. Come on, boy. Come on boy. You can't catch me. You can't do that to an Oglethorpe. - You tell them, honey. I'm an Oglethorpe. Oh, sure you are. Our whole family are Oglethorpes. Why, have another drink. Just lie down an relax. It's much more fun drinking on your back. There. Just let it drift down. That's it. Yoo-hoo, Lorry. Oglethorpe. Ah, there you are, sweetheart. If you want any more you'll have to wring it out of him to get it. He looks wrung out now. Why didn't he eat the bottle? You'd better take Mr boll-weevil out of here before he eats the cotton blanket. He's always like that. Always passing out. I'll take care of him. I'll take care of him. Come on, let's get going, fellow. I's alright. It's alright. I am cold. Where is his coat, huh? Come on. I'll take care of you over here. How soon do we get to Good Hope? - Why bring that up? Listen. We're going to New Orleans. Purser. Yes, sir? You've got a couple of crooks on board. - What? In there. What's the matter with you? Did you swallow too much? Oh, pipe down. [ Door knocks ] Who is it? - Captain Scroggins. He must want us to sit at his table. - Come on in. Why, how do you do, Captain. Which one is it? - That one. Where is it? Where is what? - You know what. That sixty bucks. He had it right in here. Who is this vulgar person? - He's drunk. Search the room. I know who you are. We'll go a lot easier with you if you'll come through. Why, the very idea! I've never been so insulted in my life. You will pay for this intrusion. I will sue the company. Why you cheap tin-horned palooka. I've a mind to lay this one on you .. Hey, stop her! Hey, come back here! Will you wait a minute now .. What you going to do? If you guys don't leave me alone I'll jump overboard. You can't bluff me. I'm warning you. I'll jump. - Just a minute now. Hey, Lorry! Can you swim? [ Ship's horn! ] [ Ship's whistle! ] What's all the racket about? I think there is something wrong with that old steamboat over there. Probably lost one of her engines. Sounds like it anyhow. A fine chance of finding her in this fog. Could you imagine her drowning like that. And in water, too. [ Ship's horn! ] Hey. Hey, you! Holy smoke. A mermaid. How about canning the wisecracks and pulling me out of here? Sure. Why not? Hey, Poko, give me a hand. - Shall I help you, boss? Watch out for my stockings. It'd gone. What's the matter? I lost sixty bucks. That's what's the matter. Well, you shouldn't carry so much money with you when you're going swimming. It's all your fault you clumsy lug. Hey! What did you want to do that for? - Shut up or I'll throw you in too. Hey, Poko. That's alright, boys. I'll handle this. You've got a lot of cute tricks, haven't you. Here, let go of me! Let go! [ Laughter ] [ Laughter ] Shut up, you hyenas. You had enough? Yep. I've had enough. Alright, give me a hand here, Poko. You never had your throat cut, did you. You think you're a pretty smart guy, don't you. Sure, I think I'm a smart guy. Well you might get me some dry clothes. Sure I might. You might tell me why you're floundering round in the water with that rig on too. Well, I fell off my father's yacht. Anything else you want to know? No, that will be enough for now. You'll find some dry clothes down below. Imagine a dame like that. No, sir. Anything more, boss? How about some more catfish. No thanks. I've had so much now I'm about ready to meow. Alright Alice, you can take it away. She ain't got half the appetite some of your other girls had. The conversation is more interesting when you keep your mouth shut. Here you are, Alice. You can pay the boys off tonight. Yes, sir. You'll have it all back anyhow by the time we get to New Orleans. Alice ain't got nothing but sevens on them dice of his. Well. So you've had other girls on board? Sure. They were a different kind of gal. How do you know I ain't the same as they are? Ah, you just put on a hard front. You know what you're doing. I'll say I do. I'm going places. You're going to New Orleans whether you like it or not. You're some kidder, ain't you. You're not a bad guy at that. - I'll say I'm not. Want to play checkers? - What for? Read a magazine? - No thanks. You know, I ain't said anything about it but .. I'm kinda sorry I .. Pushed you overboard this afternoon. No, that's alright. I like a woman with some spunk. Only don't make a habit of it. Well, I was sore. Sixty bucks is a lot of dough. Sure. Say, now we're getting to know each other better. Why did you jump off that steamboat? What steamboat? - You know what I'm talking about. I had a reason. Uhuh. What's your racket, big boy? Smuggling? No. Cotton. Smuggling is too much trouble. I don't see what you get out of life living on a smelly barge like this. What's the matter with it? I got everything I want. Plenty of fresh air, food right out of the river. No worries. Stopovers at New Orleans. Listen. I even got a cabaret. Well you can have this dump, cabaret and all. What does that clock say? Nine o'clock. Time to turn in. Come on, scram. What you doing? I'm getting my royal bunk ready. We turn in early on this ship. There you are, sister. Park your body. Any time you want to. What are you going to do? I'm, going up on deck and get some sleep. If you want anything during the night, ring for it. And try and get it. Boss, I thought you never would stop sleeping. How long we been in? About a half hour. Well, how about some breakfast? - Yes, sir. See what that channel swimmer wants. That who? The lady. - Who, her? She's gone. She's what? - She's gone. Said she wouldn't wait for no breakfast. Alice, so help me if I ever get my hands on that dame .. What is it, Hoyt? Miss Lorelai Evans? What's her business? Some sort of a newspaperwoman. - Well I don't care to see her. What does she want? She's writing an article about important men in America. Something like that. Oh. Well then, perhaps I'd better see her. Don't you think? Yes, sir. - Hmm. Will you come in, please? How do you do, Miss Evans. Won't you sit down. - Thank you. I only have a few minutes. Yes, I know. Important businessmen are always so busy. Do you think that I'm important? - You're so modest. So, you say you are with the .. - American Newspaper Syndicate. We're writing a series of articles on successful businessmen. You know, captains of industry, lawyers, bankers .. Aren't you rather young for this sort of thing? Well, I'm not very long out of convent. I rather expected a fat, frumpy sort of woman. They usually are. Are you disappointed? - I didn't mean it that way. You are .. you're a woman hater? Wait a minute, wait. I didn't say anything of the kind. That's alright. I'm a man-hater. That is, in a way I am. You know, my career comes first. You are a bachelor, aren't you? - I've never had time for anything else. I've been so hard at work all my life .. That I've almost forgotten there is such a thing as a private life. Hmm. I wonder why bachelors are always so good looking. I don't know. Are they? You're so modest. Mr Paige, tell me, are you annoyed with women? That is, the fortune-hunter kind I mean? You know. Not exactly. Say, what sort of an interview is this? Are you .. Interviewing me about my private life or my business? Well, we like to know as much as we can. And. What kind of books do you publish mostly? Love stories? No, not entirely. For instance, our Introduction To Physics .. Is a standard in 68 colleges and preparatory schools. That's wonderful. Our big volume of sales however is in hymn books. Published in 12 different languages. Why, that must be wonderful work. You know the one: "Who are you at home?" "Who are you .." That used to be my favorite at convent. - Oh. Let's get on with it. It used to be uncle Rupert's favorite too. Who? Uncle Rupert. Haven't you heard of him? - No. I don't think I have. Oh he's very well known. Colonel Rupert Evans of West Virginia. Well, however .. Now, what else is there you want to ask me? Well, what are your views on drink? You mean prohibition? - Yeah. Yes. Oh. Well. The 18th Amendment is a law. And as a law should be respected .. Until it is rescinded by the voice of the people. I see. You mean you ain't in favor of drinking? I beg your pardon? You mean you are not in favor of drinking? I just said I wasn't. - That's very interesting. Why? Well, I've interviewed many other important men. And you're re the first one to believe in prohibition. Now just a moment, before you write anything down. That isn't my personal opinion. Oh, then you do approve of drinking? Well under certain circumstances .. I think spirits may be good if taken medicinally. By the way, where is all this to be published? We have several hundred newspapers all over the country. Of course, I won't let this go in until you see it. I'll be here a few days. If you don't mind me dropping in, I'll show it you. That will be quite alright. Of course I wouldn't like to have anything printed that I haven't seen. No. I understand. Ah. What's troubling you? Nothing. I'll be alright in a minute. Oh no. I'm afraid I can't make it just yet. What is it? Just a little heart pain. I get them every once in a while. Uncle Rupert used to have the cure for this sort of thing. Oh did he? Yes. He always said that nothing would do the trick like a little toddy. A little what? A little toddy. You know, a drink of some kind. You haven't anything here, have you? I'm not sure. I may have a little something. You are so thoughtful. Is this what you wanted? I hope you don't think this happens to me very often. Well that's alright. Aren't you having one too? There is nothing wrong with my heart. Just a little one? - No thank you. Well. Here's to a pain in the back of your head. Shush! Yes. I know. It's your own house. You can do anything. We're going to be nice and comfy in your house. Here we are. Now we're going to go to sleep. There you go. Put these on and you'll be nice and comfy. Yes, yes. Everything is going to be alright. Yes. Good morning, Mr Paige. What time did I get home last night? I don't know sir. I was asleep. Did I .. did I bring anyone with me? No-one that I saw, sir. - Right. Well, get me a Bromo Seltzer. A big one. - Yes. What are you doing here? Why, Stephen. Stephen? Stephen, you carried me here, of course. I did? Oh. Perhaps you don't want to remember? You don't want to remember, do you? How much do you want? Why, I don't want anything. I just want you. Well you can't have me and you can't stay here. I'm a respectable citizen. At least I was a respectable citizen .. Until you tricked me into doing something I didn't want to do. Tricked you? And after all the things I said last night. What did I say? Never mind. I don't want to hear. Anyway, you've got to leave. Where can I go? I can't go back to father. And you won't have me. I suppose I'll just have to .. Oh, and after all the things you promised. What did I promise? - Don't you remember the little nest? What nest? Our little nest we were going to have all to ourselves. I was drunk. I suppose you don't remember drinking champagne out of my slipper? Uncle Rupert told me you were such an honest man. I don't care a hang about uncle Rupert. - You wouldn't ..? I don't even believe you have an uncle Rupert. Why, Steve. - Here. And don't call me Steve. Very well. I'll go. I can suffer if I have to. I know what I'll do. I'll kill myself on your doorstep. - You'll do nothing of the kind. Don't you dare hit me. I'm not going to hit you. I just want you to keep quiet. I won't keep quiet. I'll kill myself if I want to. Now don't get hysterical. It's my life and I'll do what I want with it. Please don't scream. - I will! There you are, boss. How is your headache? Worse, thank you. And .. Tell Henry to get the car ready. We're going out looking for apartments. Yes, sir. [ Door knock ] Yeah? A visitor. That channel swimmer. Oh it is? Hello. You never expected to see me again, did you. Well I sort-of thought I might. You thought my conscience would bring me back? I didn't count very much on your conscience. I thought if you didn't come back pretty soon, I'd mosey out and look you up. With a policeman or something? - By myself. I guess you must have been pretty burned when you saw I'd skipped with your dough. For a minute. Then I decided you must have needed it worse than I did. To steal it. I did. Here it is. Thanks for the loan. I guess I really should pay interest. Seeing that it's set me up in business. Is that so? What kind of business? What I mean is it .. It paid for the clothes that got me my present job. Then I'm glad you had it. Is it a good job? - A bed of roses. It ought to smell good. What is it? Well, I'm sort-of a governess. A governess, huh? Who do you govern? Oh, the offspring of an old southern family. What do you do, teach them good manners? Not so far. You certainly can think up a heap of questions to ask, can't you. Well if I don't find out where you are, how can I come around and see you? You can't. They don't allow visitors. What do you mean? You must have an evening off once in a while. Yeah, but they don't give me the drawing room to entertain in. That's alright. We'll go out somewhere. Do you like to dance? - Sure. Are you good at it? Oh I guess I can get by. Yeah, I guess you can get by. What's the matter? Nothing. I just couldn't remember whether your eyes were blue or grey. Well, I hope worrying about it didn't interfere with your work any. No. How about tomorrow night? Well. I'll have to let you know. What time is it? A little after four. It had better be "Yes". Maybe. If you can't make it tomorrow night how about the next night? I don't know. I never can tell. I've got to be going. I've been gone too long. When will you let me know? Stop around some time tomorrow? - Oh, swell. Say, if you got the offspring of that southern family on your hands .. Why, tote them along with you. I'll find them something around here to amuse them. Yes. I guess he'd be amused alright. Goodbye. Can you imagine old man river washing an item like you right up against my barge? Was that a lucky break? Was it? You know, I'm kinda superstitious about it. Everything good I've ever had has come to me out of this river. Miss Evans will be here directly. I wish. Why, Miss Brown. What a pleasant surprise. How do you do? Come off that horse and try walking. - Minnie, you look swell. Park your body there and tell me all about it. You don't look so bad yourself for a corpse. A corpse? You were supposed to be drowned. And you don't even look damp. Well, I got myself resurrected. Well, you done a good job while you was at it. Does he own the mint? No, but he's got an option on it. Minnie. I had to give in sometime. You see, my hips were getting away from me. You know, I can't stand obesity. You can't stand what? - Let it go. Get ready for a shock. The name is Oglethorpe. Oh no. I had to marry him to get out of Good Hope. I can't believe it. Oh well, I've had my moments. Oh Stevie. Stevie, I want you to know Mrs Oglethorpe. How do you do, Mrs Oglethorpe. How do you do, mister ..? Just call him Stevie. How do you do, Stevie. Minerva and I want to convent together. Oh yes? Where? Where? Why, West Virginia of course. - Oh. Can I see you for a minute? Excuse us a moment, Minerva. Sure. Who is that woman? I told you who she was. Well, I don't want her coming here. Oh. So I can't even have my friends in this house. Is that it? I'm sick of sneaking up back alleys to find a roomful of people when I arrive. Minnie is not a roomful. - This is my place and I like it. Oh, so it's your place? - I pay for it, don't I? So that's it. You get me in a situation. - I get you into it? You got me into it. I got you into it? - Yes, you got me into it. Oh! That's what I get for trusting a man like you. Now let's not have any more of that. You don't care anything for me. You are just taking advantage of me as you know I have no home of my own. I know what I'll do. I'll kill myself. Go ahead. You can cut the dramatics and listen to me. I won't listen to you. - Oh yes you will. I've been investigating you. You what? Yes. And nobody in West Virginia ever heard of you. And they've never heard of your uncle Rupert. Why do you lie to me? And why do you lie about that girl? She's never even seen a convent. Neither have you and you know it. You're a spy. - No, I'm not a spy. You are a spy. - No I'm not. Yes, you are. Nothing I do is right. You don't trust me. I know what I'll do. I'll throw myself out the window. Go ahead. You wouldn't even care? - No. I can get other men. You will do nothing of the kind, you understand. Oh, so you're jealous? Oh yes, and there is something else I'd like to talk to you about. What's this interest you've been finding down at the waterfront lately? What waterfront? - You know. Oh, so I can't go anywhere without your spying. If I ever find you running around with another man I'll .. You won't take me anywhere. I've got to go someplace. Have we got to go all over that again? It's your bargain as much as mine. Oh, I'm going to kill myself. Go ahead. I'll pin a note on my chest. - Shut up. You know what the note will say? - I don't care what it says. It will say: "Young girls beware of Stephen Paige". Fine. And when I come back I don't expect to find you here. It's a very nice place you have here. - What of it? Just an idea. - Well, keep your ideas to yourself. He has a swell temper. Yeah. A southern gentlemen from the old school. He must have graduated a long time ago. Turn that thing off. - Why? It makes me blue. I am just trying to drown out your domestic happiness. What's the matter? You act like you had a bad pickle. Minnie, I've got to talk to you. - Okay, if you don't get serious. You know, you must let them win once in a while, or they lose that old interest. Do I look like a sap? Not too much with all this. Well it ain't everything. If you do get tired of this little place you could move into the Central Station. You ain't in love, are you? No, but he's got my goat. - Who is it? Oh, just a guy. Why don't you make a changeover? I can't. He lives on a cotton barge. I borrowed some money from him one day. You know, the day I jumped off the boat. You know what he did when I took it back? Sure, he took a sock at you. No. That's just the trouble. He said money isn't everything. If I needed it more than he did, then it was okay with him. The guy has got my goat. I'd hardly guess it. Why can't you have a guy like that in a place like this? Why not? You got doors on the place, ain't you? Is Sherlock Holmes around? Did you ever try eating your cake .. And having it too? It's an old Swedish custom. [ Fog horn ] Come on Buck, get these off the deck. - Yes, sir. Let's go. Get that. Don't let it throw you. - All stop. It won't go no more. Ready to clean up, boss. Well give Buck a hand. Well, I never saw people get so much fun out of working my life. Hello. How is my favorite governess? Well, how are your boll-weevils? A terrible thing happened coming down. A couple of them died from indigestion. That's what they get for going on a cotton diet. It's doggone good. Have you tried it? Here, try some. - No thanks. No, listen. It's very good. - I just had my lunch. I'll take your word for it. Okay, but you give it to me and I'll knit a shirt out of it. That reminds me of something. - What? Have you missed me? - Who'd miss a big lug like you? I guess you didn't hear what I asked you. Of course I did. I said who wouldn't miss a big lug like you. That's better. Now, speaking of good things to eat. I got a surprise for you. What is it? You going to kiss me? - No. Better than that. Come on. There you are. - What is it? Open it and find out. Why it's lovely but I still don't know what it is. It's an Indian kimono. It's what Indian women wear when they want to frighten their husbands. I think it's wonderful. I've got another treat for you. What is it? Say, what is this treat? I'm going to let you watch me shave. You are too good to me. Any woman that can get me to shave more than twice a week must have something. And I have something? - Enough to get by. The enemy, huh? Certainly. Why? Because you're the kind of a woman that goes around pushing people off boats. Yet other women? Only those I've met. I bet you've never even had your arms around a girl. Oh yes I have. Part way .. she was a fat girl. Well. Try putting your arms around me and see how it feels. Alice. Company is here. How about staying for dinner? We're going to have catfish. I can hardly wait. Catfish for two. Catfish for two. There's a lot of them up there tonight. - A lot of what? Those things up there. Stars. Oh, is that what they are? Sure. If you're a good girl I'll reach up and get you one. I like that one. Oh, you can't have that one. I promised it to somebody else. You can have any of the others though. - No. That one or nothing. What makes you so quiet tonight? I'm worried. I'm beginning to like fresh air. It's not very painful after you get used to it. Why don't you come over and sit down? Improve your mind. Is that painful too? At first. That one up there is Venus. If you're in a fast plane travelling top speed it takes fifty years to get there. I'd be too old to enjoy myself. What other trips have you got? Well, if you just wanted to go on a short trip, you can run up to the moon. How long will that take? Probably make it in about 166 days. You know too much for your own good. I ain't even started yet. You see that one over there? - Let's just look at it. I'm going back up the river in the morning. Why not stay here? Just like this. What would people do without cotton? Who cares? I am .. Thinking of taking on a new cargo. What? A woman. How about it? How about what? I just proposed to you. What did you propose? I propose that you become Mrs Dan Walters. And help me run this barge the way it ought to be run. What was that? A tidal wave? No. It was just me. Try it again. So that's what it's like. Well? What do you say? I don't know what to say. Listen, kid. I'm crazy about you. Something has happened to me too. Genevieve. Genevieve! Did you call me? - Oh yeah. Is Mr Paige here yet? - No, Miss Lorry. Hasn't he phoned all evening? - No, Miss. I think he went to the theater. - Oh hang. I wanted to see him. You better start packing my bags. I'm going away with the swell-est guy on the swell-est boat in New Orleans. Well, what sort of clothes will you be wanting? I don't know. Any old clothes. I signed up to scrub decks. Hello, Minnie? Minnie? It's happened. I'm getting married. Can you believe that one? Yes. Married. Oh, I now it's a crazy hour but there wasn't anything to do. No. No, we're sailing at six in the morning. I've got to dash. I just called up to let you know I was doing it. Alright. I'll call you up when I get back. Goodbye. Going somewhere? Hello, Steve. Well, you seem to be in a hurry. Yeah. I wanted to see you. I wanted to tell you that I'm walking out on you. What, again? This time it's on the level. I'm getting married, Steve. I heard that but I didn't believe it. It's true. I just wanted to say goodbye. - Now, just a minute. Who, if I may ask is the lucky man? Rich, I presume? Oh, just a big, romantic love affair? He must be very young. - Yep. And that gives you the right you think to throw me over? It gives you the right ..? - Now wait a minute, Steve. You got me all wrong on this. I ain't throwing you over just for anyone. I love this guy. You love him? - Yeah. I can't say I'm very upset over the way I've treated you but .. I did want to be able to tell you myself. Tell me what? There's so very little I don't know about you already. I trust he knows as much. Why? I don't imagine you're taking very many chances. Listen Steve, I never really cared for anyone in my life before. Why should I spoil it all by telling him? Why? Because he'll find out all about you one of these days if you don't. Then he'll throw me out? Probably. I'll take that chance. I guess I don't rate much more anyhow. But I'm going to grab my happiness while I can. But you said you loved him? - I do. You couldn't do what you're doing if you did. If you're going to marry this man you've got to tell him all about yourself. Or else you will? Maybe. Steve, you can't do that. I am going to be square with him. Honest I am. A man imagines the woman he marries is something set apart. Something clean. That's why young love is different to anything else in the world. You're just being old-fashioned. Maybe. But so is every man. I don't know. I ain't saying you're wrong. You got me so scared you're probably dead right. But I can't tell him, Steve. I can't. - Why not? Because it's true. He'd never look at me again if he knew. Who is this man? He owns a cotton barge. What? Ha! Why I can't believe it. Do you mean to tell me you'll give up all this .. For a cook and washerwoman's job on a cotton barge? Why, you'd be bored to death in a month. We've had a lot of fun together. Because we never fooled each other. We knew just where we stood from the start. This could go on for a long time. The other never could. - No? No. I've got your bag packed, Miss Lorry. You can unpack it, Genevieve. Miss Lorry has changed her mind. No. Give it to me. - Yes, Miss. You think I'm all wrong? That you can get away with it? Well, maybe you can. You sure took the wind out of my sails. You ought to thank me for it. Yeah. I ought to kiss you for it. Well, that's not such a bad idea. No, Stevie. I'm on my way. I don't know where to, but .. I'm starting now. To him? Why don't you stay? I'll always take care of you. You don't want to buck the world all over again. Thanks, Stevie. But maybe that's just what I do want to do. Buck the world again. Are you sure really know what you do want? Yeah. I guess I know. [ Door knocks ] Eight o'clock, boss. Yeah, I know. We was due to shove off at six. Yeah. You wouldn't know where to look for her, would you? No. Well I guess we'd better shove off. - Yes, sir. [ Fog horn ] [ Fog horn ] [ Fog horn ] [ Fog horn ] What did you get me here for? Just to watch you train for a marathon? I'm sorry. I may as well come to the point. It's about Lorry. I'm afraid I miss her. Hmm. Why not? Now you're a practical woman and I think you can help me. Just a minute. I ain't as practical as I used to be. Well anyway, I think you can help me. Look here, Lorry is my girlfriend. Now wait a minute. You don't understand. I want you to help me get her back. Oh. She says she's in love. Of course that's ridiculous. She's been living alone in an attic room ever since she left here. I'd hate to see you get out of the family. But I can't help it if my girlfriend is cracked. With probably pride. I'll take vanilla. I've tried to see her several times but she always avoids me. If you could only persuade her to return I'm sure everything would be different. She can have all the money she wants for clothes and things like that. I'll even buy her a new car. Well I might try dragging her here behind a couple of horses. No, no. That wouldn't do. But if you could arrange a chance meeting. You know, by accident. If I could only see her and talk to her .. I'm sure everything would straighten itself out. Perhaps at the Mardi Gras next week? You know, a party or something. Well .. they can't shoot me for trying. Of course, there will be a few little expenses. Expenses don't matter. You know, little odds and ends. - Uhuh. Is that enough? That ought to hold out for a little while. Well if it doesn't hold out, you come back. You know Mr Paige, it's too bad you wasn't born twins. That's really a very lovely quality don't you think? What size are you looking for, Madam? Size 3? Miss Adams, have we any size 3? - Yes. A large 3 or a small 3? - Small. A small 3 Miss Adams. I'm sure we'll find one. Say listen, what happened to the blond that used to be here? Blond? Oh you mean Miss Evans? She didn't get smart and quit did she? - No, no. Certainly not. She's been promoted to the Odds & Ends. Right over there. What size are you looking for, madam? Hello, Minnie. How long you going to serve time in this joint? I'll wrap them. I've been promoted. If they gave you this store you'd still be the loser. Where is the children's department? - Downstairs, madam. Listen, Oglethorpe is giving a party, see. What? Oglethorpe is giving a party. A Mardi Gras party. I'm busy, Minnie. Leave me alone. Oglethorpe is giving a party tomorrow night. I thought you'd like to come? He's giving a party at the Mardi Gras. Oglethorpe is. 8's and 9's right there. You'd really get someplace if you tied knives to your elbows. [ Foreign language ] Not at all. Not at all. Wrap up the lady's stockings. Are they for you or for your piano? Oglethorpe is giving a little party. Minnie, be quiet. Having difficulties? - Who wants to know? I beg your pardon? Why, have you done something you shouldn't? I was just trying to be of service. That's all. See, it is a very embarrassing subject. I have to talk it over with a lady. Oh yes. Miss Adams. Are you coming or not? - No. I'm going to count to three. And if you turn me down again I'll scream and say you insulted me. One. Are you coming? - No. - Two. Have a heart. - Three. [ Scream! ] Are you coming? - No. [ Scream! ] Are you coming? - Yes. What's the matter? What is it? Miss Evans, what is it? Everything is lovely. I just got so excited I lost control of myself. Yes, they are beautiful aren't they. Nothing to be alarmed about ladies. Yes. She just got excited over one of our marvellous bargains. Mr and Mrs Oglethorpe are here. Alright. We'll be right here. Good evening, Mrs Oglethorpe. Meet the breadwinner. - How do you do. I'm delighted. I heard a lot about you. - Keep quiet. I was going to come as Napoleon at first but Minnie said I looked better in this. I didn't want to take any chances. Turn around and let Mr Paige see how nice you look from the back. Very nice. How do you like this costume? Do I look alright? She'll never resist you in that. Well, hadn't we better get started? - Yes, let's do that. I'll pick up Lorry and meet you at the caf?. And I may need a little change money for taxis and things like that. Oh yes, of course. I'll get my purse. And listen you. If you say anything out of the way .. I'll take your rattle from you and hit you over the head with it. Well I .. - Shut up! Mrs Oglethorpe's table, please. Certainly, Mrs Oglethorpe. Right this way. How do you like this for attention? How come I rate all this attention? You're going to have a good time tonight if I have to bust out in a rash. You shouldn't let Oglethorpe be so extravagant. I'll worry about him. Easy come, easy go. That's right. Easy come, easy go. - Shut up. Well, what would this turn out to be? When Oglethorpe opens up he opens up all over. What is that? If it wasn't so obvious I'd kick your shins under the table. Woo-hoo, Mr Baxter. Won't you join our party? I want you to meet a friend of mine. Hello Stevie. Well, how did you recognise me? I wouldn't have except for the costume. Have a nice time. - Where are you going? I'm going to dance with Oglethorpe. And how. Come on. Hold this. I've got to find a pirate. You think we're going to dance? - No. I got to have some fun. Here. Take this and tickle people as they go by. You like it? Sure. What girl don't like nice things? I ask you to put it away somewhere. You shouldn't leave things like that laying around. They may go up in smoke. But it's for you. Come on, park it someplace. I've quit thinking of dollar signs. You still hearing barge whistles? - Nope. You're wrong again. That's all over too. The lamp is still burning in the window. Well, he'd better save the oil, Stevie. The wandering girl won't be back. [ Door knocks ] Oh. Well .. you remember me, don't you? How'd you find out where I was? A little bird told me. Can I come in? Yes, of course. Come in. Was the little bird's name "Minnie"? A Minnie is a fish. Were you just leaving here? Yes, I .. I'm just about to go to work. I'm a little late this morning. Do you like working in that department store? So you know about that too? It's alright. How's the cotton barge? I'm going up the river this afternoon. How about coming with me? I want to. But Dan, I .. - But what ..? Why do you think I didn't go with you the last time? I thought of a lot of things. - It wasn't because I didn't want to go. Whatever your reasons .. You might have given me a chance to fight it out with you. That's what I was afraid of. You see, Dan. There are a lot of things you have to know. Things I just can't bring myself to tell you. I know everything In need to know. I know all about that offspring of the old southern family. I know everything .. - Dan. You know that I left him, then? Yeah. But you don't know why? No. All I'm interested in is why you left me. Because I love you. I wanted to prove to myself I could be the kind of a girl you wanted me to be. Oh, you did, did you? What about me? What do you think I've been doing while you've been proving things to yourself? Do you know I've done nothing for months but look for you? You know, my crew think I'm crazy. That my business is shot. As far as I'm concerned that barge can sink unless you're going to live on it. You're not afraid of what you're getting? No. I'm not. Then I think I will. Why didn't you say so in the f?rst place? I don't know. Why? Well, well. How long has this been going on? I like to see true love triumphant. * steve d *
