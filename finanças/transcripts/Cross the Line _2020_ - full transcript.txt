CROSS THE LINE I'm out of cigarettes. - Hi, Toni. - Hi. - How's your Dad. - Good. Glad to hear it. OK, thanks. - Bye. - See you. - Dani. - Laura? Hi, what's up? Dani? It's over. Come here. Come here. It's OK, it's OK... Hey, look at me. It's OK. Here. Careful it's hot. - OK. - Careful. So now what? We'll have to start the paperwork, but I've got it all ready... No, Dani. I'll take care of the paperwork. You've done enough all these years. I was talking about you. What? What now? I'll talk to Claudia. - You're going to ask for time off? - Time off? No. I was going to ask her to make me full-time. And what you wanted to do? Laura that was... stupid. - No. - It was stupid. Dani, it wasn't stupid. Dad's gone. I know. He's gone. I know. Here it is. Look. - Looks like paradise! - You'll be staying right here. The tide doesn't come in until 2pm, you can go walking, - enjoy it all... - How wonderful! It's the best trip I have to offer. - We can't wait! - Have you been there? One day. You go first and tell me all about it. ONE MOMENT, PLEASE Dani! - Dani! - What's up? - Want a coffee? - OK, lots of sugar, please. OK. What are you doing next Saturday? - Having lunch with my sister. - I need you to swap shifts with me. It's just with my Dad and all... - But you see your sister every week. - I know. I've met the love of my life! This woman... Dani, what are you doing here? Give me a hug. - How are you? - OK. Look at me. Why don't you go home? I already had 2 days off. I was a bit down, but I'm OK. - Finish your shift and go home, OK? - OK. - OK! - Good. Thanks. What happened with your dad, man? - He died 2 days ago, but... - Shit! It's OK. Honestly. Sorry, man. I feel bad asking you to swap shifts. Would you mind though? OK. - Yes or no? - Yes! I'll do it. My condolences, man. Seriously. - OK. - Thanks. - Hi there! - What are you doing here? - I wanted information about a trip. - Are you OK? I want to buy a ticket, but I have some questions. Maybe you can help me, Mr... Aranda. Laura, please don't do this. Does the ticket I want have a name? It's like Interrail, but with planes. I can't remember the name. You can go all over the world with it. Laura, please! I'm at work. Should I call your supervisor? No! It's an Around the World ticket, OK? - That's it! - We'll talk later, OK? Could you tell me about the conditions, how the ticket works? Don't do this to me, please! - OK! Excuse m... - No, no! An Around the World ticket works via an App and includes all necessary flights to go round the world cheaply and easily. The condition is you have to travel in the same direction, always forward, never backwards, OK? Just like life. Sounds great. I'll take it! Laura, please! No. There's more money on this one. Here. Charge it. Charge it. Thank you. Whose name shall I put it under? YOURS Use this code to download the App and reserve all your flights. Just add all your information. And you know the best thing? If you cancel within two weeks, there's no charge. No. Dani... - don't you dare. - I'm not going on any trip. Enough! What are you scared of? I'VE BEEN VERY SELFISH WITH YOU. NOW HAVE SOME BALLS AND FLY! DAD - Dani! - Laura. What's up? Come to the window. Why? Is everything OK? Where shall I send your postcards? Home or here? Here! I'm thinking of setting up a camp bed in the law firm! I'll be here all night here for sure. - Lots of work, huh? - Loads. When I finish the case, I'll come see you wherever you are. Make it somewhere with a beach, for God's sake! That smile... I've really missed it. I'll let you get back to it. OK. You know I love you, right? Me too. Ciao. Ciao. WELCOME: DANIEL ARANDA CELAYA CITY: BERLIN YOUR SELECTION: TOMORROW ARE YOU SURE? THIS BOOKING CANNOT BE UNDONE. Excuse me? Can I sit down? - Eh? - Can I sit down? Are you OK? - No. I'm not. - What's wrong? I've got a problem. I ordered two burgers, but my date's stood me up. Would you mind paying for them? I'm so sorry. I'm really embarrassed just having to ask and... - Sure, it's OK. - Really? Yes. How much is it? 20 bucks. Well... $19.80. Here. Great! Thank you. Excuse me, can I pay? Thanks. - I'll leave the 10 bucks here. - OK, thanks. - See you next time! - OK, bye! Bye! Hey! Sorry about before. I'm not like that, I swear. Honestly, I didn't have anything on me and... I was pissed and I took it out on you. Don't worry, it's OK. The burger's on me. Honestly. What's your name? Daniel... Dani. Dani, I'm Mila. Nice to meet you. Sorry again for being rude. It's my treat, seriously. If you come round the corner with me, I'll pay you back. No, honestly, it's on me. It's not a problem. It'd make me feel much better, I've had a real crappy day. It's just... I really should be getting home. But are you OK? Hey! What...? What's wrong? I'm not OK. Please, come with me. Come with me and I'll give you your money back. Seriously, it'd make me feel a lot better. It's right here, honestly. OK, fine. I'll come with you. You will? I feel so bad, sorry. Sorry for being such a pain in the ass, but... I've had such a shitty day! Seriously, it's fine. You know what happened to me? I had a date... and the guy stood me up. Yup! So I thought: I'm sure that cute guy will pay for my burger. - Pathetic, huh? - No, it's not pathetic. - Hey, when do you leave? - Leave for where? I saw... you had a plane ticket. - I'm not sure when I'm leaving yet. - Where are you going? Wait. Careful. I'm going to go around the world... perhaps. Not just next door, round the fucking world! Wow! Take me with you... now we're friends. I'm joking! - Where's your name from? - Mila's Russian. - Are you Russian? - No. Mila really comes from Milagros, but I thought Mila was kind of cool. We're here. - What are you doing? - I hid the keys here, ‘cos my friends are coming later. It's so we can all get in. What is this place? I work here. Give me a hand. Help me get the shutter up.

If you won't take the cash, I'll have to pay you back some other way. What? Choose one. - What do you mean? - Choose one. You know my tattoos are worth a lot more than those burgers, right? I don't understand. I'm giving you a tattoo. I don't want a tattoo! There are more over here. Come see. Let's see... - I'm hot. - So take off your jacket. Give it here. But seriously, don't worry about the tattoo. Here. Just have a look. Come on. This one's really you! Am I right? OK, let's see... What wouldn't you ever erase? Seriously, I don't want a tattoo. I'm serious. I mean, I don't know... Where would I get it? Wherever you like. Take a look at these. I am looking at them. - Which one do you like? - I don't know. - Shall I choose for you? - What? No! Sure? I don't know. - What's wrong? - Nothing, nothing's wrong. - Are you scared of me? - No. - You sure? - Yeah. So, why won't you look at me? - What? - Why won't you look at me? - L am looking at you. - When you talk to me, - you look away. - No. - Yes, you do. - I'm looking at you now. Only ‘cos I brought it up. What was the last thing someone said that really hurt you? I don't know. Well think about it. This will help make up your mind. I don't drink. No, no... How many more times are you going to say no? Bravo! So? Which one do you want? - You nervous? - A bit. I told you, I'm an expert. It won't hurt a bit. How you doing? - Good? - Good.

Have you tattooed all these people? For my collection. - It was Dani, right? - Yeah. You sure? Come on, we have to go! Have you seen my cell? No. - But, aren't you going to... - We have to go! - What's up? - My friends will be here soon. Come on! Let's go! OK. Help me. You go first. - My jacket, my jacket! - Where is it? - It's on the side. - Where? On the side I think. Hurry up! Here you go. Take it! Give it here. Lock it. Here. Hold this for me. Let's go! Come on, let's go! Have you got anything better to do? Come on, come with me. OK, fine! It's your loss! You're so boring! Run! Run! - Does it hurt? - Eh? - Does it hurt. - Not really. I thought it'd hurt more. You'll see... once you start, you can't stop. - What's that look for? - I'm not giving you a look. You so are! Wait here a sec, OK? Sorry. Sorry. No, I don't smoke.

Go round the other way. BARCELONA SUICIDE BARCELONA SUICIDE SUSPECT INVESTIGATION UNDERWAY. POLICE LOOKING FOR THIRD PERSON WHO FLED THE SCENE. CONFIRM FLIGHT ARE YOU SURE? THIS ACTION CANNOT BE UNDONE - Good evening. - Good evening. - License and registration, please. - Yes. Why'd you run? - Because... - You turned round when you saw us. - Yes, you're right. - Why? I realized I was going the wrong way. I had to turn around. Sorry. Where were you going? Home. Turn off the engine and step out of the vehicle. Mr. Aranda, turn off the engine and step out of the vehicle. After you. Get in. He turned round as soon as he saw us. He'll test positive for sure. You can pick your car up once the alcohol's out of your system. - Can someone come get you? - Yes. No... I'm sorry. Can you try again, please? I already... Call her cell if it's so important. I have already. I've been home... Plus, I know she's working on a case here. - Please, try again. - She's not here. Listen, I know she's here. Please... - You're going to have to leave. - Laura! Hey! - What are you doing here? - Can we talk upstairs a moment? Yes... of course. Come with me. Hang on! The visitor's sheet. - Name and surname, please. - Carlos Jurado. Carlos. OK. Your ID, please. - I don't have it on me. - Come on, Fernando. Rules are rules. The rules also say no visitors during your shift, but everyone lets it slide. Go on. - Thanks. - Thanks. Dani, what's going on? Dani, what's wrong? I killed someone. I killed someone! I killed someone by accident. OK, I'll stop by later then. OK, see you later. Ciao. Can you give us a minute, please? Sure, I'll leave you to it. Thanks. I couldn't talk to my police contact. He'll call back later. I asked a few questions about the case, but just casually. The police know the girl came home with someone, but they don't know if that person left before or after the deaths. There's nothing to identify you, Dani. Dani... - I have to hand myself in. - No, listen. I have to hand myself in. Dani, listen. You can't do that. They won't believe you. If you weren't my brother, I'd think you pushed that girl too, to get out of killing her boyfriend. You understand that, right? It has to be... full of my prints, full of absolutely everything... That doesn't matter. Prints are only useful if they've got you on record, so... Even if they found your prints, blood, sperm, hairs, it wouldn't matter, because they have nothing to compare it to. They're looking for you, but they don't know who you are. They don't even know if you're male or female. None of the neighbors saw you. We have to wait. We were both in the same restaurant. - OK. - Yeah... Did you pay in cash or by card? - L paid... in cash. - In cash. Without a card, there's no name. Even if the police found out that she had dinner there, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter, because there's nothing that links you to her. Can't you see? What about the tattoo? - Did you pay for it by card? - No. So what do we have? The neighbors didn't see you, you didn't eat at that restaurant, you were never in that tattoo shop, there's nothing that links you both. What? The photo... the photo. What photo? She took... She took... a photo of us with... with a Polaroid. Where's that photo now? She hung it on the wall. It's of both of us. - I have to hand myself in. - Dani, listen to me. Let's wait... for my police contact to get back to me, OK? Let's wait until he gets back to me to see how the investigation's going. That photo might not mean a thing. - I'm sorry. - It's OK. Dani, please. We have to wait. I'll call as soon as I hear something. It's better no one sees you. Don't worry. It's OK. Shit! Amore! - Amore, what is it? - Shut up. - What's up? - Shut the fuck up! Don't talk to me like that! What are you doing? What's happened? - Why's that fucking open? - Oh, fuck! What's up? I've told you to keep the fucking shutter down! - It's not hard! - It was down! The fucking shutter's open! We're supposed to be fucking closed! Man, I swear, I thought it was closed! I'm sorry, dude, I guess I spaced out. Fucking shut it! Hey, here's your share. - Here's your share. - Don't be so paranoid! That gram's waiting for us! - Turn out the light. - The fucking alarm! Shit! For fuck's sake! Come on! OK! Let him put the code in. - That's it. - OK, let's go. Dani, I've been calling you and... I have to talk to you. I've spoken to my police contact and he said... Mila and her boyfriend fought the whole time. So the police think Mila killed Ray, then killed herself. Everything points to that. They think the person who was with Mila left when Ray showed up. So, Dani, they've closed the case! They've closed the case, no one's looking for you. Call me, OK? Call me when you get this. Good evening, I'm calling from Bit Security. Your code, please. Can you give me the code to deactivate the alarm? Mila. What the fuck? Open the door! Hey! What the fuck do you think you're doing? Turn that shit off! Where the fuck are you going? What are you doing here, asshole? Come here, you bastard! - He's in there! - Break down the door! Open up if you've got the balls. Fuck! You son of a bitch! Don't let him go! Don't let him get away! Fuck! Quick, run! Outside! There he is! He got away, you idiot! Where are you going? Please, no! I'm begging you! Where the fuck do you think you're going? Are you fucking crazy? What are you doing? Stop the fucking car! Stop! I'm going to kill you! You're a dead man! Asshole! No, no! No! Come here, you piece of shit! You're in deep shit now, you fucking idiot! We've got him! Try and run now! Now where you going to run to? - Who the fuck is this guy? - No idea, man. Hey! Fucking look at me! - No! - You recognize him? What the fuck were you doing in my shop? What the fuck were you doing there? - Please! - Answer me! - Please! - You going to make me run again? Where are you going? Asshole! Take that! You've really fucked up this time, asshole! Argh! My ear! Son of a bitch! My ear, you asshole! Let him go, he's fucking crazy. Sorry... Sorry... Can you lend me your cell? I need the phone. - I need the phone. - Give it to him. Please. Give it to him! Babe, let's get out of here! Hello? - Laura! - Hello? It's Dani... it's Dani. Dani! I've called you a hundred times! - Where are you? - The street. You OK? Did you get my message? Yes, I heard it. The police don't even know you exist. They've closed the case. - But there's something else. - What is it? - What is it? - I think it's better if... we talk in person. Meet at Dad's place? Tell me now. What is it? - Laura, what is it? - Dani... - She's alive. - What? She's alive... she's alive. But how? A car broke her fall and saved her life. She's in the ICU at the Hospital del Mar. She's in a coma. She's in a bad way. They don't know if she'll make it or... if she might wake up one day. It could take years. The thing is... if she wakes up she could talk. EMERGENCY ROOM ICU
