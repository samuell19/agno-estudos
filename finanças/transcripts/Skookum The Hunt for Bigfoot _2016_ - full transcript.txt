I had a beer with him, said he wanted to show me something. Took me out in the backyard and I saw these with my own eyes, man, I'm telling you, woo, like I say, these guys did have their heads torn right off their shoulders. I coulda swore I saw something... Oil City, Louisiana. I don't really know when it began. Everybody fortunate enough to have struck oil, they headed outta the city years ago,. Those of us still left in the city were left without jobs, without the proper means, and it was a failing economy. We watched those oil wells pump every last dollar out of our city. Desperation does strange things to folks. We'll do whatever it takes us survive. It's in our nature. For some, that's crime, others join these extremist groups or become survivalists, join militias, preaching about new beginnings. Then there's superstition. We're poor, uneducated folk here. Nobody ever told us Bigfoot don't exist. Yeah, I seen him. We ain't the first people that seen him neither. The Indians here, they call him Sasquatch. Further west, they call him Skookum. He's like a man, but a good 10 feet tall and covered in hair. - What the hell? - Mitchell Rock. Mike Wooley here. I'm out here on Whiskey Road. - I see. - Near Chamberborn. I saw something huge in the area- - Calm down. - around the edge of the woods, it scared my cattle. - I know right where that's located. We'll be there in 15. - What's going on? - Possible Bigfoot sighting out on Whiskey Road. The farmer said that something's been spooking his cattle. He went out to investigate and he saw this huge form walking upright on the tree line. He was pretty rattled. He could barely get his words out. I told him we're on our way. - Great, I'll go get my shoes. - Okay, kids, you know the rules, don't open the doors for anyone, and absolutely no scary movies. Yes, daddy. - Why are you going, daddy? - We're gonna check out a reported sighting. We won't be gone long, I promise. - Why are there so many Bigfoots out? - I don't know why, sweetie. There's no need to worry. Bigfoots never hurt anyone, except little girls who watch scary movies. - Daddy, please don't go. - Someone's been watching movies again, huh? We're not going far, just down from your friend Jake's house. It's okay, Mego. We're not gonna be gone long, and your big sister will take good care of you, won't you, Anna? - Sure, mommy. - No more scary movies, girls. Yes, mommy. - Anna banana, I'm scared. - There's nothing to be afraid of, Megan Dawn. The house is locked up and nothing out there is gonna hurt us. - What about Bigfoot? What if he tries to get us? There's no such thing as Bigfoot. Nobody's ever even... - What was that? - I don't know. Just probably bugs on the screen. Bugs don't growl. - Hey, fresh track. This span is bigger than 18 inches. - Looks like it's leading up to the barn. - I think you're right. He might still be there, I'll get my camera ready. - What was that? - Mitch, Mitch! Mitch? Mitch! Mitchell Rock's body was found in a cave just outside the swamps, and the locals said Cynthia had been eaten whole. The police said it was some animal attack. Dr. Jeff Cameron, he had been the Rock's contact for years, and the story of a Bigfoot eating his researchers made him notorious. Meanwhile, the Rock's children were put in foster care. Dr. Cameron tried to get custody, but the state thought he'd be an unhealthy influence. After Megan's parents died, Jake was Megan's only friend. He stuck by her and even chased her through three different foster homes. - Megan. - Go away from me. - Everybody's looking for you. - I don't wanna go away, I wanna go home. - They won't let you go home anymore. - Why? - Because of your parents. - I can go with you. - My mom's gone and my dad gets, he gets angry. - I'm not leaving. - Megan, your social worker's looking for you. I'm not going with them. - Jake, put your bike in the back of the truck. - Don't leave me. - Jake! Put your bike in the back of the truck. You're gonna get it, boy. - Here, take the bike. - What are you doing? What are you doing? Now you're really gonna get it. Megan had a disturbing obsession with Bigfoot. She was put through years of therapy, but on her 16th birthday, she showed up at Dr. Cameron's office and joined his team as a Bigfoot researcher. - And so we see the adaptive diversity of the fossil apes reached its zenith during the Miocene, some 20 million years ago, although most of those species were extinct shortly thereafter. One exception to this, however, was Gigantopithecus, which persisted in Asia to a mere 200,000 years ago, or as some have suggested perhaps even to the present day. And that will be the subject for our discussion next week. So until then, everybody have a good weekend, and don't forget to turn in your assignments before you leave. - Professor, did I see you on "Nat Geo" last night? - As a matter of fact, I think you did. How did I do? - You were great. - Well, thanks. - Dr. Cameron, could you please sign this for me? I'm a huge fan. - I'd be happy to. - It's Melanie, right? - Yes, sir, thank you. So Anna, what's your analysis of this situation that's going on? Well, I believe if we- - Well, Dr. Morris, to what do I owe this pleasure? - I hope you're aware that you are making this university a laughing stock throughout the entire scientific community. - Is that a fact? And just how have I managed to accomplish that? - Bigfoot! Since your appearance on national television, we've received no less than 100 emails and phone calls from parents and alumni. Now, they all realize that Bigfoot is a hoax, but now they're asking why one of our professors is on national television promoting science fiction? - So what's your point? - There's a letter petitioning for your dismissal circulating through the campus as we speak. And I personally signed it first. - So what are you saying, Morris? Should I be getting ready to box up my office? - What I'm saying, Dr. Cameron, is your tenure is in jeopardy unless you start conforming to our strict academic standards. - Your standards? Are we through? - Well, now, that just depends. Are we clear? - Got it. Connor, come on in. Dr. Morris was just about to leave. What have you got for me? - Incident report. - Uh, incident report? - A Bigfoot siting. - Oh, no. - Marion County, Texas, very credible witness, fascinating story, but nothing concrete. Why do you still have this? - Connor, you know we all love Anna. - Dad, Anna and I are done. She's moved on, living her dream. I'm over it. Subject's closed. - Well, I'm not so sure that she's really over it. - You got somethin'. Oh, what you got? Oh, oh, oh, looks like 14 inches, and size does matter. You know last year the whole damn cold dried up the freaking lake, wasn't a dam fish to be had, but this year I'd say we got ourselves a honey hole. - Looks like trash fish to me, hoss. - Well, what are you doing? Well, what done crawled up your ass and died? - Me and the old lady got into it. Really? Oh, I'd say the honeymoon's over. Always thought you two would tear into each other like two possums in a gunny sack. - Her brother's been running my traps. - No shit? Damn, don't he know what happens to people around here for doing that? - Well, I'm gonna tell you, if it wasn't my wife, I'd a'done fed him to the swamp thing. I bet you're rethinking that decision, huh? Damn, what the hell was that? - A panther. - It didn't sound like no panther I ever heard. Well, pull us onto shore. - For what? - I gotta shit like a pet coon. - With the panther? - Ain't no damn panther, come on. - Bones? This is Planet News, Louisiana. Welcome to "The Four Corners Show with Steven Carvey." - Hello and welcome to "The Four Corners Show." I'm Steven Carvey. - And I'm Dr. Anna Rock. Thank you for joining us. - A sudden rash of Bigfoot sightings has been reported in the Southern most swamplands, actually, Anna. - Oh, I'd love to see psychological profiles on these folks who claim to have seen Bigfoot. - Yeah, I'm sure you would. Dr. Anna Rock, our resident psychologist and professional cynic. - Thank you, Steven, I love you, too. Yeah, I'm sure you do. - So Anna, what's your analysis of this situation that's going on? - Well, I believe if we looked at these so-called reports, we'd find they're a by-product of wild imagination, superstition, and pure unadulterated ignorance. - So let me get this, Anna. When you see a body that's been ripped in half, you call that superstition and ignorance, a figment of someone's imagination? No, I don't believe that. Oh, Steven, I've seen rednecks do worse. I wouldn't stake my sister's reputation on a report like this. - Oh, yeah, your sister. Anyway, up, halt, hold the debate. We have a caller on the air. This is Mike Wooley. I've seen a creature. I've seen him with my own eyes when I was deer huntin' near Caddo Lake. Hey, it's me. I know I shouldn't be calling. I was watching your show last night. It's been six months. I would love to talk. Hey, sis, it's Megan. Just wanted to let you know I'm in Louisiana on a Bigfoot research trip. Wanna meet me? I can pick you up at the house. I guess Anna and Connor had been together. Some folks said Anna took Connor from Megan. There was definitely some bad blood between them. I'd heard Anne and Connor had even gotten married in Vegas and divorced a week later. You hear a lotta things though. - Oh, shit, not my day. Dammit. - Hey, Jake, it's been forever. - Hey, Megan. - I was hoping you'd be here. - What brings you back into town? - I'm here doing some field research and my car just broke down at the big curve down the road. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm just a little rattled. - Let me get you a beer. - Oh no, no, thank you. If you could just help me. I really just need to fix my car. - It can wait. - Yeah, you're right, I just need to do something. - Relax, Megan. - Jake, I can't relax. Graduate school is so competitive, and with my background, the only way I stand a fighting chance for admission is to prove myself in the field. I have to, I have to go. - Just unwind a bit. - Easy for you to say, you already made it into law school. - Listen, you got Dr. Cameron on your side and your parents were his main field researchers. You don't need to worry. - What are you doing here anyway? Aren't you supposed to be in school or something? - Yeah, I had some things I had to take care of. - Hey, let's go fix that truck of yours and get something to eat. - Oh, that sounds great, and I'm starving, let's go. ♪ This road is hard ♪ ♪ This road is long ♪ ♪ This road, this road I'm on ♪ ♪ This road is hard and long ♪ ♪ This road is long now ♪ ♪ Long now, hard and long ♪ ♪ Like I say, I won't give up ♪ ♪ Even though the way is tough ♪ ♪ I gotta move on ♪ ♪ Move on down that road ♪ - Aw, if it isn't the lovebirds. Haven't seen you in a while. - I'm just here doing research. Huh, lookin' for that booger, I reckon. - Yeah, I saw a cow yesterday with its head twisted back like a corkscrew. - Coyotes kill cattle all the time. - Yeah, but they don't break a backbone. - Why is it that all the UFO's and the Bigfoots and all the other crazies always have it in for cows? - Uh, Jessica, would you get us two cheeseburgers, fully loaded, and two sweet ice teas? - Sure. - Hey, Jessica. How's it going? - Oh, you know, Megan Rock's back in town, looking for Bigfoot again. - You should introduce her to my husband. He's a Neanderthal, probably brothers. - So you been down to the- Two cheeseburgers, fully loaded. - Been down to the lake? - Pronto. - Have you been down to the lake? - Well, I'm meeting with a local hunter down there and he says that he's encountered a Bigfoot. So we'll see. - Old Man Wooley? - Mike Wooley, the- Where are those cheeseburgers? - Old man Wooley, the local crazy? You know that guy's like one joker shy of a full deck. I don't know how to tell you this, but I'm pretty sure he was there when your parents were killed by Bigfoot. - Mr. Wooley? - Call me Mike. - I really appreciate you inviting me here today, Mike. - Seems like I invited you, not him. - Oh, he's just an old friend of mine. - Well, how about I just uninvite you then? - Oh, that's all right, he was just dropping me off. - Okay, well, come on in. - Well, as I mentioned before over the phone, I'm here conducting research on the Bigfoot sightings around here. Do you mind if I record our interview, Mr. Wooley? - You can put that thing up or join your friend outside. - Okay, Mr. Wooley, tell me your story. - I got to my deer stand early. I was waiting for dawn to break. Perfect weather for a hunt. A mist was rolling in. I saw something huge and hairy walking upright. I first thought it was a militia boy trying to scare me off my good deer hunting spot. I raised my rifle ever so slow, I looked through the scope, I saw the meanest, evilest, red eyes, devil eyes. - Mr. Wooley, were you there when Bigfoot killed my parents? - So tell me about this whole Bigfoot obsession. - I just wanna prove that Sasquatch exists and that it killed my parents. - Revenge, I like that. Want some beer? - Got anything stronger? What are you doing? - Nothing, it was just in the fax. - You know, that kinda defeats the whole attorney-client privilege. Yeah, but you're not even a lawyer yet. - Yeah, but they don't know that. So my buddies and me are having a party down by Caddo Lake. You wanna come? - Sure, as long as I can take some pictures. - Why not? It's Bigfoot country, you might catch one after all. Cheers! Hey, hey. - Come on. - Megan Rock, all the way back home. You remember when we made out back behind the bleachers? I think your imagination is running wild, Tommy Frank. - I don't think so. - I think everyone else here does. - Okay, man, this place is a total sausage fest. Where, where are the girls? - So Megan, think you're gonna be sleeping with me tonight? Give it up, Jake, we've known each other since we were knee-high to grasshoppers, ain't gonna happen. - Awe, ain't gonna happen. - Come on, nothing official. You know, old friends with benefits. - Um, no. - Megan, why are you here? - She's here hunting Bigfoot. Bigfoot, watch out for them vampires, too. - To the fresh meat. - To the fresh meat. - Hi, I'm Brad. - Hi, I'm Megan. - Do you mind? - No. - So, are you new here? Unfortunately not. I can't seem to get outta here no matter how many times I try. - So what brings you back? - I am actually a Bigfoot researcher. - Bigfoot, really? - Really? - Well, I have a few Bigfoot stories of my own. - Oh! - Wanna hear 'em? - Yeah, do you mind if I record it? - Oh, sure. - Great. Okay, I'm ready. - I live on a farm. Last night, we lost two cows. There were tore open from stem to stern. - Oh my god. - Hello? Nope, I didn't get page two. No, I didn't get it. No, I didn't get it, all right. Get out of the way. - What? - Shit! Help, help! Dude, there's a body! - What's the matter with you? - Dude, there's a dead body in the boat, man. - Shit, what the hell's going on here? Where's Megan? Tommy, where's Megan? - She was with you, man! I pissed all over myself. - It's been three days since my sister's been missing and you haven't found a trace of her yet. - Not a trace, not a clue, I'm sorry. - She is out there! She's out there. - Well, are you, are you sure that your sister didn't go off some place with some guy? - My sister wouldn't do that. What a cop out, pun intended. - Well, we've got to exhaust all possibilities. - Things don't add up here, sheriff. Look, sheriff, if you can't do your job- - Ms. Rock, if you break the law in any way, I will not hesitate to arrest your citified assitude and have you put in my jail for interfering with my investigation. - What investigation? I'm the only one who's looking for her. - Could we sat down, please. I have a gimpy leg. - Okay, now you're talking, sheriff. - When you pick up the maps and the radio from my deputy, ask him about a local fellow, his name is Gator. Clyde, give me some copies of these maps of the area that we've already covered and round up some radios. Clyde's right down the hallway, ma'am. - Deputy Clyde? - Um, here's the, the, the map you asked us for, ma'am. - Okay, thank you. - You can see on there where we, we, we've charted off the areas that have already been, been searched. You see this here b-button? Look here, that's what turns on the unit. Go ahead and talk and then hold, hold down the button and let, let them answer. - Okay, I think I got it, thank you. Oh, what about the guide? Yep, his name is G-G-Gator, all right? Now, go to the Channel Marker Lounge tonight at about d-dark, and the name and directions are on the sheet there. He'll be, he'll be, be, you'll know who he is. - Okay, thanks. - You're welcome, and be careful now. Lady, one, one, one more thing. You might not wanna go there alone. - In all likelihood, this is not a Bigfoot track. It's simply a normal human footprint. Although it's fairly large, it displays all the characteristics of a male homo sapien, compressed toes, well-developed arch, narrow heel. These characteristics are what we use to, excuse me, I'm sorry. - Hello. - Connor, it's me. Anna. - Anna? - I tried calling your dad, but I couldn't reach him. - Wait, what's wrong. - It's Megan. You sent her on some wild goose chase in a godforsaken Louisiana swamp, and now she's missing, all thanks to your Bigfoot obsession. - I'll be on the next plane out. No, just tell me where to look. - I mean, my dad can help you. Wait, Anna, Anna? This is Kayla Grace on scene. A recent rash of reports has local residents speculating about the return of the Caddo Lake creature. Numerous reported sightings and mutilated cattle certainly point to the possibility. Unconfirmed sources also state that two men and a local college student are missing. While this hope is sketchy, police also confirmed that blood was found at both scenes. Police are asking you- They just keep getting younger and dumber. - Good morning, ladies, how are y'all? - Good morning. - Morning. - Kit and Roxie Ray on a Saturday morning. What do I owe this privilege to? - Look what we found. - How much do you think this is worth? - What is that thing? Let me look at it a second. What is this ladies? - It's a Bigfoot track. We made a casting of it. We were picking us some blueberries for a pie. Bigfoot track. Let me make a phone call. Sheriff's office. - Sheriff Hayes, Mayor Dickey of Pickers. Mayor, what's going on? - I got a couple ladies in here you may know. They brought something real strange in this place. I need you to, I need you to call Mayor Purvis over at Falk and get him in here. It looks like his monster doesn't respect state lines. Are you serious? - Yeah, I'm serious. Yeah, come by, see you in a minute. Mayor Purvis. - Good to see you again. - Thanks for coming by, man, appreciate that. A couple hours ago, two of my regulars brought in this Bigfoot cast and they said they found it off of Whiskey Road. And you know, I'm not a believer. - Well, this is Dan Shrigley and this is Larry Fleming. They're both highly-respected Bigfoot researchers- - Hi, Dan. - in the area. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Pleasure to meet you, Dan. Look, what do you think? What do I have here? - Wow, this is very interesting. This cast has a mid-tarsal break along the line of fluxation. I think that this is real. Larry, what do you think? - I think you're right. In the dermal ridges over here, they're apparent. That evidence alone authenticates the cast. - So, uh, your guy's telling me this thing's for real. It's hard for me to believe. - It's definitely real. - Sheriff, you know, we've had all the Bigfoot sightings and the cattle being slaughtered. A couple of fishermen are dead, some more are missing. We gotta do something. Guys, what are you saying? - Well, it sounds like we have a real Bigfooter on our hands. - Yeah, and any real creature is just gonna keep on killing until something kills it. - Sheriff, we gotta do something. Our people, townspeople, won't even come out anymore at night and they're frightened. I think it's time for a full-out manhunt. - We got a group searching for a young girl named Megan Rock. - Where are they? - Caddo Lake, about 10 miles out of town. - We need to get out there as soon as possible. They could be in serious trouble. - I'll get my men right on it. ♪ Black River run all the way to the back ♪ ♪ Gold river red or blue on black, ♪ ♪ I said, Red River rising, then the cold river fall ♪ ♪ I bid farewell and you're lucky you all ♪ ♪ Bad moon rising, watch it wait by a tree ♪ ♪ That old black water ♪ ♪ She waits her whole life for a handsome jack ♪ ♪ But he ain't ever comin' back ♪ - Yes, ma'am, what can I do you for? - Yeah, I'm looking for a Gator. - Well, we got lots of gators around here now. - No, I mean, Gator- - I reckon you mean Gator the man. Well, he comes in here about now this time every day. - Except when he don't. Can I do something for you? - I got this. How about I buy you a drink there, missy? - No, I'm good, thanks. - You sure do smell good. - Do you know what time Gator's gonna get here? - Well, if he's gonna be here at all tonight, it'll be after dark. What do you need him for anyway? - It's none of your business. - Look, lady, if I was you, I'd stay away from that man. - And why do you say that? He's crazy, a real loner. They say the war just drove him crazy inside and an alligator took care of the outside. - An alligator? - Oh yeah, he was running trotlines one day, and they say he was leaning over the side of his boat, and that old gator came up from real deep and real slow, bit him on the head like that. Oh, but he survived, I don't know how, but he gutted that old gator. It cut him right there and left a real pretty scar. He's had the name ever since. - No, no, no, no, oh, now, now. Well, let's see what we got here. - Easy, lady, 'cause I don't wanna have to get rough now. - Drop the knife, Roy. Let the girl go. You make me. Gregory. - I need to get a grip on myself, I'm losing it. Any of you scumbags even touch a woman like that again, I swear to God I'll come back and gut you like a pig and leave you in the swamp. Get outta here! Move! Take it easy, man. - I coulda killed you. Don't make me regret my choice. - We didn't mean anything by it, man. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Well, I do. Get outta here! - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Let's get you outta here, come on. - Here. - You wanna tell me what the hell you were doing in that bar? - I was looking for you. My sister's missing, she's in the swamp. - And you want me to help you find her? - She was doing research. - Yeah, I know all about it. - I need a guide, someone who knows the swamp. Lady, you're trouble with a handbag. You don't have enough sense to stay out of a bar like this by yourself, and you want me to take you into the swamps? I don't think so. - I'll pay you 5,000. - Not interested. - Coward! I'll get a GPS then I'll do it myself. - All right, I'll take you in. Meet me at the abandoned bridge at dawn. - I'll be there. Thank you. - Yeah, don't thank me yet. You just might not like what you find out there. - Todd, that girl's little sister's missing. She just offered Gator $5,000 if he could find her. They're gonna go down to the bridge first thing in the morning and see if they can find her. - Well, let's get out there tonight and see if we can have ourselves a little looksie. - Let's go. Stop, stop! - What? - I think I saw something. - Where? - Right over there behind that big tree, right there. - All right, so keep your light on it, I'll go check it out. - Yeah, yeah, I got you, brother. What the hell was that? - Let's get the hell outta here. Shit, he's behind us, shoot that son of a bitch. Shit, he's on the back! There's a natural order to our town, and when city folk come in, stumbling in any bar they choose, throwing around money, they upset that order and folks get killed. - Hey, Jake Nolan, you remember me, right? - Yeah, Megan's friend. _ The sheriff told me they had a search out for Megan, so I figured I'd come help. - Fine, but play by my rules. You play, you stay. If not, you go. Got it? Who the hell is this now? - It's Jeff and Connor, they insisted. Whatever. - If I could have avoided it, I would have. - So what kinda gear do you guys have? - A few clothes, sundries. - I have some batteries, a flashlight and GPS. - Sundries, GPS? - Yeah, GPS. You should get out of the swamps more. - Listen, boy, your global positioning satellite is not gonna save your ass out here. You wanna get out of this swamp alive, you gonna listen to me. Load the boat. Hours up river, the sun was setting. Soon they'd be trapped in darkness. During the day, the swamp is deadly, but at night light a fire and hope it scares off all those creatures that hide in the darkness and never leave that light. ♪ If I'm dreaming, please wake me up ♪ ♪ This feeling just ain't right ♪ ♪ It gets darker every time I open my eyes ♪ ♪ Even days feel like nights ♪ ♪ So as I lay my head down to sleep ♪ - Anybody got reception? - Not for me. - It won't work out here. - Okay, time for a little come-to-Jesus meeting. Out here, you're gonna do what I say when I say it, no questions, got it? - Gator knows this swamp like back of his hands, guys. - Make camp. They're out there. - What's out there? - It was about a year ago, this time of year, I was out fishing, minding my own business. The water was just like this, still, black as coal, but it was coughing up keepers. I guess it was here for the same reason. The thing is I just didn't wanna leave here. - Wait a minute, are you talking about Bigfoot? Look, I refuse to believe any of that stuff. - I'm not talking about Bigfoot. Swamp thing, an old mean, scaly gator about the size of two canoes. Been roaming these swamps for decades, eatin' everything and anything in its path. Rows of razor-sharp three-inch teeth wrapped around my head, pulling me under. Then it just let go. I don't know why, it just did. Next thing I know, I'm laying there looking up at Santee Cloud. - God, what if that thing got Megan? - No, it's just- - A rogue alligator. - Where'd you come from? - I make myself invisible. - Relax. - Meet shaman Santee Cloud, chief of the Kadohadacho tribe. How are you, my friend? - I hope I didn't frighten anyone. I came to help you find your sister. - Ah, oh great shaman. - Show some respect. - Santee, I'm Jeff, this is my son Connor. We're research scientists and friends of Megan's. I'm sure you're aware of our concern that Megan may have encountered a Sasquatch. - I'm familiar with your work, Dr. Cameron. - Well, I hope you'll share your knowledge of the Sasquatch with us to help us find Megan. - Like spirits of the forest, my people consider him sacred. He appears only when mankind has strayed from the way, neglected his stewardship to nature and fallen to disharmony. - Unless he's gone rogue, like swamp thing. - Well, that could explain the rash of sightings we've had lately. - Anna, what happened? - I saw these big orange eyes and then everything just started spinning. - Jake, do you have some water? - Are you okay? - I feel nauseous. - It was Bigfoot, she saw Bigfoot. - Infrasound, Sasquatch can use low frequency vocalizations to stun and disorient their prey. That's probably the explanation for the vertigo and the nausea. - A highly developed defense mechanism, my people know the secret to countering that negative effects. - What's the secret? - You must focus your mind on- Help, help me! - That's my sister, Megan! Megan! - I fear Gator is right. The first time I saw big Bigfoot, it knocked me right on my ass. You can't look him in the eyes. I thought I was having a heart attack. I blacked out. The son of a bitch probably would have eaten me if my boys hadn't shot him with a hunting rifle. - The creature has gone rogue. - Megan! Search in and around the lake. Time is of the essence and Goat Island. - Santee, you and Jake, go to old man Wooley's. He may have some answers. I'm going to Goat Island. - Gator, I'm gonna go with you. Connor, stay here with Anna. - All right, come with me. - Well, if I hear it, I'm not staying by a campfire when my sister is out there. - No, Anna, look, you have to stay here. She may come back to camp, seeing the campfire. Let's go. Why Goat Island? - 'Cause that's where the damn beast dragged me, some sort of graveyard for giants. I woke up with a mouth full of dirt, nearly smothered. The damn thing buried me. I thought I was either dead or dying. Now if that thing took Megan there or something like it, we're better off finding her. Let's hope not. It must be quite tough to remember old nightmares. Trust me, professor, the swamp thing is definitely not my worst nightmare. What will that mean? - It doesn't mean that much when half your unit's dead. We were ambushed, pinned down. Managed to pull two of my guys out. I was going back for the rest, and I took a bullet in the leg, couldn't move. Hodges through a grenade in and I just had to lie there, watch my friends get blown to pieces. What, saving your unit cost you your life? - Yeah, but it's better than living with this hell inside of me every day. I lost my life back there with my unit. You're still here. - Let's go to the mounds, professor, and hope we don't find what we're looking for. Hang on, professor. Hang on. No! Help me! - Did you get lost? What took you so long? - Hello! - Mr. Wooley! - Mike! Mike. - We need to speak to you about a missing girl. - This guy's off his nut. We're wasting our time here when Megan could be out there. - Not all wisdom comes from the wise. Checkmate. - Listen, we're here about a missing girl. - What do you wanna know? - Have you seen anything unusual? - I found a gold chain and a locket in the woods. - Where? - Near the old compound. - Compound? - I know what's going on at the compound. I've seen the guns, and I knew your daddy before he went to prison. - Listen, old man, you're crazy. - Where did you see the chain and locket? - In the woods. - Old man, tell us where the locket is. - I hung it on a nail. - It's not there. - Yeah, I know, my friend took it. - Yeah, your friend? - Bigfoot. Listen, old man, you are crazy. - Thank you, sir. - Hey, what's wrong? - Megan's out there somewhere, okay? You and your dad are turning this into a research trip. - Anna, if anything happens to Megan, I'll never forgive myself. I'm the one who sent her on this assignment. - Well, then why aren't you looking for her? You know, you're sitting around the campfire with your dad telling stories, comparing notes with each other. - We can't do anything until sunrise. The swamps are dangerous enough during the day. - Nothing ever changes with you. It never does, Connor. Your priority has always been this stupid fairytale, and you know what? I've lost my parents, I've lost you, and, you know, now I'm gonna lose Megan. - I loved you, Anna, you know that. - That doesn't make this okay. It doesn't make everything, it doesn't fix everything. - How can you ask me to give up my job? - Because chasing myths is pointless. Okay, it's killed everyone I've ever loved. Can you see that? God. - God, I didn't mean you. Megan! Megan! Megan! Oh my god. Anna! - Megan! Megan! Megan, oh my goodness, sweetie, you're alive! - Anna, you came for me! - Of course, we did. You're my sister. - Anna, we have to get out of here fast. - Megan, what's wrong, what's wrong? - It's Jake, he did it, he did it. - He did what, what did he do? - He attacked me! He attacked me at the party in the woods, Anna. It's Jake! - Looks like we have a little family reunion here. - You can't do this! - Oh, but I can. You see, I killed Santee. I cut him up real pretty. Now I'm gonna do you. What was that? Run, run! - Oh, it looks like we got ourselves caught in a little bit of quick sand. - Jake, why are you doing this, Jake? - You did this. You did this when you read my fax. - What fax, Jake, what fax? - Oh, don't lie to me. You know, page number two. Don't lie to me, I already found it in your pocket. Jake, I'm so sorry, please don't... - Megan, I thought I could trust you. I took beatings for you. - What's going on? - Jake, what are you doing in here? - I heard somebody crying. - Mrs. Rock fell down the stairs, and that's why I don't want you on the stairs. You can get hurt. Now go upstairs to your room now, go, now! Why are you doing this? - Simple, Liberty militia. You see, the only way to get this country back on its tracks is with a full government overthrow. My father started it, but a country judge put him in jail. So I'm determined to get him out. - You're a monster! - You see, I tried doing it the right way, with law school and such, but my daddy would rot in jail before I'd ever get it done. You see, family's everything. - Megan, it's okay, I'm here to help you. No, no. - Who invited you, huh? Get up, get up. You don't touch another man's property. Yeah. Welcome back, lieutenant, you are redeemed, you've made us proud! We're okay, he can't hurt you anymore. - My sister, my sister, we have to save my sister! Please help me. - We'll get her. Come on, let's go, come on, let's go. Let me up! Help me, someone! - I'm so sorry. - Me, too. - I didn't mean to abandon you. - You had to move on. - We found C-C-Connor and the ambulance is taking him to the hospital. - What happened to him? We f-f-found him unconscious, but he's f-fine, ma'am. - Where is he, do you know which hospital? - I'll see if I can f-find out for you, but thank God you f-f-found what you were looking for. - I really did. You opened a can of worms that's gonna have me doin' p-p-paperwork for a year. You know those two boys, them that died in the boat? Well, T-Bones wife's brother, one of them Liberty boys, he killed T-Bones and Crater while they was out fishing. - Oh my god. - God rest their souls. Y'all keep warm now. - Thank you. - Connor, it's Anna. Look, I'm really sorry about everything that happened, but please can you call me when you get this message? I just, I need to know you're okay. I just need to know something. I really wanna make it work this time. So call me, bye. - Goodbye, my friend. We never did see Gator again. I don't know why he ever told them that Dr. Cameron died. Maybe Gator didn't think he was dead. They never did find the body. This is Planet News Louisiana. Welcome to "The Four Corners Show with Steven Carvey." - The anonymous set of photos that were received have gone viral on the internet. They show a alleged Bigfoot and an enormous molar. You know, Anna, I gotta tell you, I find this whole thing to be a hoax. I don't believe any of it. - Oh, I'd stake my reputation on it being real. - You would stake your reputation on this? - Absolutely, I would stake my reputation. - Wow, well, that's pretty heavy. So anyway, well, that wraps up our show of "The Four Corners." I wanna thank you for joining us again. And on behalf of "Four Corners," I'm Steven Carvey along with- - Dr. Anna Rock, thank you for joining us. - Have a great day.
