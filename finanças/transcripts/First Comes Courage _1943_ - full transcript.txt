- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes - Fr?ken Larsen. - Lieutenant. Traitor! You're a little late, Fr?ken, I've held your appointment. Thank you. Oh, Major Dichter's calling for me. Would you please tell me when he arrives. Yes, Fr?ken. A fine Norwegian lady. Anything wrong? It still hurts to have them turn their backs on me. - In Holy-land... - It's much better, you should feel less pain. I do. In Holy-land? The garrison's been reinforced by 1,500 men. The artillery to protect them was delayed. I know about that. - Is there anti-aircraft in Holy-land? - There are no artillery at all. - I'm not finished with you yet. - Major Dichter is going to meet me here. That's a reason for taking a little more time. Your relations with him remain good? Paul Dichter has two loves. Sometimes I think his F?hrer takes second place to me. Does he comment on your visits here? Only the ordinary things. Will I have to wear glasses, am I satisfied with you. Nothing to worry about. We can't be too cautious. Every time you give us something results in a raid, thanks to you, Nicole. The commandos attacked St?rheimund base last night and destroyed three submarines. Good. Nicole, you understand it's only a matter of time. - Won't suspicion be directed at you? - Yes, I've always understood that. As soon as you have any evidence of that pressure, you must tell me immediately. Because when that time comes, he may have to die. - Must I kill him? - No, Nicole, No one from Stavik must do it. Too many innocent people would suffer. We'll send to England for an executioner. Much better, you should feel less pain. - Have you finished? - Hello, Paul. Good morning, Major Dichter. We've just finished. Keep on with the exercise, fr?ken. - Will she need glasses? - I think we can avoid them. We're getting real improvement now. - I hope so. - Goodbye, Doctor. Fr?ken Larsen. That pressure I mentioned, as soon as you feel it, call me immediately. Thank you. - My office, Hans. - Yes, sir. No lunch, Paul? Colonel Von Elser's in town. Unpleasant? It can be. There was another raid in my district last night. St?rheimund this time. I'm very sorry, Paul. Why don't you bring him to my house for dinner tonight? In an office it's so cold and formal. And a true German officer always loves his food. Especially Von Elser. That's good. This opening music by Grieg is so gentle. There's so much peace, so much security. But then the security was shattered. Peer Gynt tries to live in two worlds at the same time. So Peer Gynt he destroys himself. I've never heard Grieg's story interpreted quite that way, Colonel. Really? Then maybe I altered it to suit my taste. Yet, I believe I captured the general effect. It has been a charming evening. But it's getting late. A restful evening too, Major. You have been kept pretty busy lately. What with the British raiding St?rheimund and destroying three submarines. The munitions plant at Morgesson. The oil depot at Raudsandnes airport bombed. And all in your zone too, hm? You will see me to the door, fr?ken? Good night, Major. Heil Hitler! Yes, Heil Hitler. You always have time for music. That makes me very gross and uncultured. Very superior of him. But he has time to come here like an ordinary spy. He picked this time and this room to call me inefficient. That filthy aristocrat has always hated me and my kind. What could anyone else have done about these raids? Where was my inefficiency? Every possible suspect was caught, examined and examined again. He knows if there were one solid lead, I'd break this underground... ...if I had to wipe out every trace of Stavik. But how do I start? I've gone through this before. The problem is simple enough. The British knew because somebody told them. But who? After each raid I confided in fewer and fewer people. That's what I can't understand. St?rheimund, for instance. I knew. Captain Rehlisch knew about it. The repair crew knew. - And I knew, Paul. - Yes. You did know, Nicole. Are you suggesting that I might have told? Did you? Stop playing, please! Did you speak to anyone? Paul, you know where I go, whom I see. No Norwegians at all. Except Dr. Aanrud. I had snow blindness when I was a child. Dr. Aanrud's been treating me for years. It's in the records. I asked you not to play. Good night, Nicole. I'll call you in the morning. Hello? Yes? Who? The pressure you mentioned, it has increased alarmingly. Lt. Martin. From Stavik, sir. Stavik? - Send this to Captain Blake. - I'm seeing Blake, I'll take it. I hear your company broke the record. Yes, sir, the inspecting officer couldn't believe his own stopwatch, sir. You've done very well, Lowell. I wasn't in favor of transferring you from Intelligence to field service but... ...I'm glad now you were so persistent. I never thought of myself as persistent, sir. I want you to start intensive marching training at once. Come here. We picked a spot up north similar to this terrain. Is this our objective, sir? Hm-hmm. We're attacking on the 18th, your company and MacDonald's. It's an important job, Lowell. Destroying the oil dumps and as many of the garrisons your fellows can lay their hands on. The oil dumps are all around here according to our information. Very good, sir. I'll give you and McDonald full instructions before embarkation. And, er... as you're not persistent, I might as well tell you it's Norway. Oh, thank you, sir. What's the matter? It's a very good map, sir. That mountain could be a foot higher. At least it looked that way from the top of the ski run. Do you mean to say you recognized the district from this? I ought to, sir, I'd know Stavik in the dark. Very romantic that way too, sir. You know, my kid loves messing about with these things. I expect the underground will be on the job to help us. Any instructions on that point, sir? Well, not for the moment. Our friends up there are having a little difficulty. A nazi Commandant's getting very suspicious. We've got to polish him off and quick. Before the raid too. I think that can be easily done, sir. - You do? - Yes, sir. Oh, I just happen to think, sir. If two or three days before the raid we could put our men ashore, about here... there's a path that leads up the hill to around the back of the town. If the Germans have an outpost on it, I could swing over to the... - I mean, our men could swing over to the... - Yes. ...to the brook and go up that way. The woods will afford wonderful cover. There are lots of farms around there where our men could hide away in the barn. What then? Well, sir, once I could get into the town, um... I mean, once our men can get into the town, he'll know that there's a saddler shop in the main square. Nielsen's his name, pretty good chap too. He has a little garret up under the roof. It's so small a bat would get claustrophobia in it but, um... Well, it's not too small for a man, er... well, say a man like myself, sir. Not persistent, eh? You see, sir, from there I could get in touch with the underground. Get all the facts about the Commandant. Then on the night of the 18th, I can stick close to him and, er... rub him off, sir. The Germans will think he's a casualty of the raid, there'd be no reprisals. And then, in the excitement, I can get down to the barges and rejoin our fellows. It's as simple as that, sir. You thought all that out just at this minute, hm? Hm, I'm afraid that's a slight exaggeration, sir. Thanks. Might have been two or three minutes. Well... It sounds all right. It sounds as though you might get... It sounds as though you might get away with it. I was hoping you'd say that, sir. Thank you, sir. I'd like to take one of the Norwegians from my unit, if I may, sir. - Certainly. - It might come in useful. Take your pick. And see Blake about the other arrangements, will you? Yes, sir. - Oh, Lowell. - Yes? - Good luck. - Oh, thank you, sir. Up periscope. Kingsford. Any sign of the fishing schooner yet? This is the place. Captain Yelsen won't fail us. I've had a number of rendezvous with him. Valuable man. - Captain, sir, may I look in that thing? - Yes, of course. How can you meet a boat as easy as I meet my girl in Victoria Station? Easier, if you knew my girl. We'll hang about until we sight them. Keep a sharp lookout, Freddie. - Fourth stop. - Fourth motor stop. Starboard ten. Starboard ten off. - How far away from Stavik? - Twenty miles. Twenty miles. Oh! - S?ren! - I'm sorry. You're discharged. And after twenty-two years. Don't you think I should have at least five-year's notice? It's four days since we've been honored by a visit from Major Dichter. His colonel must be keeping him very busy. Yes, I hear they questioned Kristofferson's boy Ulaf for hours this morning. They broke his arm in three places. The major's been very busy. No telling who'll be investigated next. - Are you expecting anyone? - No. Good evening, sir. I hardly know how to greet you. Isn't this the way we've always said hello? Captain Lowell. Captain Lowell! The schooner's lying off about half a mile. They're sending a small boat to pick you up. We're going up, Freddie. - Stand by to surface. - Stand by to surface. There she is up starboard. It'll be alongside soon. Home again, Ole. Paul. Are you having me watched? Oh, it's just part of routine. But before this, Paul, I was never part of... routine. The reports on you are satisfactory. Officially I am very pleased. And unofficially? It's one of ours. Yes, I know. You were actually frightened. Frightened? Oh, you mean of a raid. Well, Stavik is a very vital point. But for the past three days every inch of this coastline... ...has been fortified by men and guns. Paul, if the reports had read otherwise, if there had been anything suspicious about me, what would you have done? Had me shot? What else could you do? I did have certain information. You gave it to me. In the eyes of Von Elser a very great indiscretion. Certainly not the conduct of a disciplined nazi officer. To make it worse, I'm Norwegian. Why, you might be shot. Or worse, broken in rank. Paul, don't you think I'd better leave Stavik? No, Nicole, I want you to stay here with me. Thank you, Paul. - Goodbye. - Gud velsigne deg. There isn't any other path up this mountain. No, that's why they picked this spot. It's a pity. Old Father Christensen lives just over the crest here. He'd have taken care of us. Oh well, come on, Ole. My cousin Thorsten. His place is before we get to the brook. I don't like to bother your cousin at this time of night. Might be strangers around. Besides, he might worry about having us there. Oh, you make me feel very bad. This is my country, you are my guest. My cousin wants to help like all good Norwegians. All right, Oleson, don't make a sound now. Thorsten! It's me, Ole. Let me in. Thorsten. There's no one watching, I made sure of that. - Aren't you glad to see me? - Ole! Of course I'm glad to see you, but I'm surprised. - I've got a friend with me. - Who? I'll tell you everything when we get inside. All right, sir. Good evening. What's the matter, Captain, are you... do you have a stomach ache? - Oh, no, no... - Then why don't you finish your trout? A very fine river trout, you know? You can't get anything like that in England. Your cousin doesn't seem to be very hungry either. - I had supper about an hour ago. - Oh, too bad we had to bother you. Why, it's no trouble, Captain. Did you have a nice trip across? You know how I love the sea. Well, I'd rather travel over it than under it. Well, I'm glad you came. Things haven't been so pleasant here in Stavik. It'll be better soon, don't you worry about that. Let's drink to that. Skol! - Skol! - Skol, Captain! Thorsten, do you know what we forgot? We forgot to drink to brotherhood. We were like brothers, you know, in the old days. Skol, Thorsten! Here two arms linked together, that's a brotherhood. - Skol, Thorsten! - Skol, Ole. If you'll excuse me, Captain. A farmer has work to do at all hours. Well, I thought you chaps knocked off when the sun went down. Gave the chickens a late snack, tucked in the horses... ...and read the crop reports till bedtime. Well, it is a special case. - You see, my cow, she... - Oh, a blessed event? Oh, a little calf is always a blessed event to any family these days. Perhaps we could help you. That's a good one, Captain, you helping a cow? I'm afraid you'd be in the way. I won't be long. Ole, I'm worried about that cow. Get out to the barn and give him a hand. - Go on! - Yes, sir. Hello, I want to speak to Captain Schmidt. Hurry! Captain Schmidt, this is Thorsten speaking. I have two men at my house. Came from England, landed from a submarine. Yes, Captain Schmidt. Both commandos. I'll try to keep them. Thorsten! You were on a field telephone. You were calling the nazis. Captain Lowell! My cousin, my friend, I caught him telephoning the nazis. - We've got to clear out! - I killed him too late. They haven't caught us yet and they're not going to, come on. Our best chance is that hill. Run with all the speed you've got. And keep down as you go over the top. Hello? This is Captain Schmidt. Locate Major Dichter for me. Good. Keep me informed, Captain. Two commandos were landed here tonight. We'll have them in out hands in a matter of minutes. That's very exciting news. You know, I've quite a good singing voice. But I haven't sung in a couple of years. Come, play for me. Keep your eye on that clearing. Ole. Ole. You get that nazi we came to kill. Captain... Sir... Telephone? - Captain Schmidt? - Yes, sir. Yes, Captain. Fine, I'll be right there. S?ren, my coat! - You've caught them? - One of them was killed. The other is quite alive, and when that one talks, my problem may be solved. That's wonderful for us, Nicole. Good night. - How is he, doctor? - An entirely successful operation. Aside from the leg how is he? Very sound. Beautiful specimen. As to the leg, I can assure you he will have no limp. I don't care whether he limps or not. As soon as he can talk, call me immediately. - Day or night! - Yes, Major. - How badly is he wounded? - I don't know, they operated last night. - Have they questioned him? - Not yet. They'll get to him soon, the weaker he is the better for them. If he should break a name in a while... Nicole, we've got to get him out of that hospital before he's questioned. But he's in a prison ward. Can you get to him? It's almost impossible except through Dichter. And how can I ask him to take me to a prison ward? You've got to find a way. I'll try. If I do, what then? You know Rose Lindstr?m? - I used to. - She's in that ward. Tell her what has to be done. Rose Lindstr?m wouldn't speak to me. She hates me as they all do. Then you may have to make yourself known to her. Yes, Major. Our Englishman has regained full consciousness. Yes. Yes, of course. You may talk to him any time now. Correct, Major. Paul! Nicole, what are you doing here? Oh, Paul, I'm so glad you're here. It's S?ren. What about S?ren? He cut his wrist while working. He's bleeding badly. No one will take care of him. You there! S?ren. See that this man is treated immediately. Yes, sir. Don't worry, Nicole, he'll be all right. Thank you, Paul. What's the matter, Nicole? He bled so much on the way down. Come sit down here and wait for me. - Make room there. - Oh, no. No, no, thank you, Paul. I'll be all right. I won't be very long. Wait here. Paul! Paul, they hate me. I can't stay with them, not now. Not the way I feel. All right, Nicole, come along with me. You'll be comfortable here. I'll only be a moment. And if you want anything, don't hesitate to ask. - Where is the Englishman? - This way, sir. I'm Major Dichter. Commandant of this district. - Dichter? - Yes, Major Paul Dichter. Oh, I knew an Otto Dichter once. Yes, good old Otto Dichter. A pudgy-faced fellow. Hanged finally. Notorious hatchet murderer. Any relation of yours? I'm glad to see you in such good humor. Well, I see you're ready to get down to business. I assume you're an officer of the British commandos. Now, that's two assumptions: that I'm a commando and an officer. As a matter of fact, I'm only British. But in any case, what interest has it for you? The names of your contacts in Stavik. Oh, is this place called Stavik? Oh, didn't you know? No, no, you see, I was just out on a fishing trip. A storm blew up and I, um... ...well, I was washed up on the hospitable Norwegian coast. You understand that you are not a prisoner of war, but a spy. Therefore subject to the death penalty. Very honestly, talking is the only way you can save your life. And very honestly, Major Dichter, if you were captured by the British, and if they questioned you and offered every reward in the world, would you babble information to save your own neck? Why should I be less honorable than you? Because you're caught, and we'd rather have you babble... ...than kill you. I can give you several good reasons for talking now rather than later. Please! Would you... would you get me a glass of water? You, get some water! The doctor's waiting for this. Just one moment, fr?ken. Rose! You must listen to me. The Englishman's to be got out of the hospital tonight... ...and taken to the basement of my house. You must believe me, this is vitally important! Fr?ken! We'll meet again tomorrow in your new quarters. Feel free to call on me at any time. Oh, Paul, I was looking for you. I'm worried about S?ren. I didn't mean to keep you waiting. As soon as S?ren is ready, I'll drive you both home. You seem very happy. It isn't every day one catches a commando. Don't you think this calls for a celebration? That's a very good idea. Come on, let's dance. What are you doing here? You're off duty! Yes, I know, I had to come back. Dr. Hoff ordered another blanket for 407. I forgot it. Oh, you forgot. Why don't you remember what you're supposed to remember? I don't know. Nurse Schmidt isn't here. I can call her. All right, I will tell her when she gets back. Go on, play some more. Did you hear what I said? If it matters to you, Paul, I'm hungry. Oh, you are? Well, that's different, of course, come on. Waiter! Nurse! Nurse! Nurse! What are you doing here? This man's burning up with fever, he won't last the night. You know what I am in your life? An international complication. Yes, I know. Because you're a Norwegian, not a blood German. Just think, Paul, what a very happy man you would be if it weren't for that. That's stupid! You are the woman I love! Shh. Do you think you ought to say it quite so loud? Why not? I'm even ready to tell Von Elser that. And the whole world. Blood German or not, I'd be very proud to lead you into high party Councils. To the F?hrer himself! And I'd say, "This is the wife of Major Dichter." Over there. - What is it? - The hospital, Major! Go right home, Nicole. All right, search the houses. You two there, you two up there. You two there, and you two stay with me. Hey! Hey, come here! - I'm Captain Lowell. - Oh, yes! Give me a hand, will you? He'll be all right. He'll be in good shape by the morning. I must go home. They'll probably want me for questioning. Rose, thank you for believing me in the hospital. For a moment I thought you wouldn't. For a moment I didn't. But when I remembered the Nicole Larsen I'd known for so many years, Hm-hmm. Formerly surgeon, Oslo. Really, you've quite a splendid background, Fr?u Doctor Rose Lindstr?m. Let me have the day's report on Fr?u Doctor. Checked out at eight o'clock, no record on your return. Then, am I to assume that before you left the hospital, you made all the arrangements for his escape? I don't know what you mean. Who actually helped the Englishman escape? And where is he now? I'm sorry, sir, I don't know. But you do know. You know, they know! Every Norwegian in Stavik knows. I see, Fr?u Doctor Lindstr?m, that you have some relatives in Morgesson. Send word to Captain Ross in Morgesson to put under arrest Sigurd and Hedda Lindstr?m. But how can they know anything? Where is the Englishman? I don't know. Take her away. Allan! Nic! Allan! It's wonderful to see you! Here, wait a minute. Let me look at you. Oh, Nic, how I've waited for this. You don't know how long I've heard of you just as a number. As part of a cold report that came to headquarters from Norway. And all the time I knew it was you. You oughtn't be standing. You'd better sit down. Come here. Allan, I never dreamt they would send you. I had to come, Nic, I had to. You see, I never knew from day to day... Why, I was almost afraid to look at the reports for fear. - Wait, darling, wait. - Yes, yes, darling. The town's being searched. I can't stay down here long. My time has to be accounted for and there's so much I have to talk to you about. Oh, Nic, talk, talk. What are the plans, Allan, how will you do it? There's a raid plan for Thursday night. - On Stavik? - On Stavik. - To destroy the oil dumps. - But they put them into the ground. Yes, we know that. And we know where they are too. - And what about Dichter? - Dichter? Oh, it should be simple to get him under cover of the raid. If you can arrange to do things for me, see that he's in town at the right time and let me know exactly where. Yes. We have a chart of the oil tanks too. You can check our information against yours about the terrain. What are you smiling at, Allan? Not long ago I met a girl on a mountaintop. We went skiing together, and she sang Norwegian folk songs to me. Nothing much on her mind, except maybe that she was in love with someone. Or so she said. And now that girl talks about raids and oil dumps... ...and checking information on terrain. I can't believe it's you, Nic. Allan... When you went back to England and I came home, I found blood on the streets of Stavik. Do you realize what that means? No Norwegian in this generation had ever seen anything like it. Or the terror and the suffering. It was a hideous nightmare I came back to. It was so hideous and frightening at first I thought of running away. I'm afraid I wasn't born heroic. Who is? But you didn't run away. What I saw wouldn't let me. Our people were conquered but they would never be subdued. They were still fighting. And they intended to go on fighting any way they could... ...until the last nazi butcher was out of Norway. And you caught that same spirit, eh, Nic? I couldn't help it. It was all around me. I wanted to join the fight. At first I didn't know how. I... I didn't know there was such a thing as an underground or how it worked. I found out from Dr. Aanrud. I went to him about my snow blindness. Hm-hmm. At about that time, this Major Dichter was stationed here. Yes? He asked to meet me. There couldn't have been anything more perfect. There was my work, Dichter. He was my assignment. Not an easy one, was it, Nic? Once you decide to fight, any assignment is easy. I don't have to tell you that. You with the commandos and you say I've changed. You, the peace-loving English barrister. Remember, the man who couldn't rake up enough courage to kill a rabbit? And last night you killed a guard. Well, the rabbit didn't say Heil Hitler. Oh, Allan, I must go now. When will I see you again? Allan, if we should decide for any reason to change plans... What do you mean, plans of the raid? No, no, not the raid. - It's nothing, really. - But, Nic, what... It's nothing, I'm just nervous. I'll be back as soon as I can. Do have a bite, Major. This herring is excellent. - No, thanks. - Why so disturbed? I? There may be news of the commando any minute. If there isn't by midnight tonight, I've ordered the hostages shot. Good. But that hardly finds the commando, does it? Spies are not always caught, Colonel. Even under the best administration. Nor do executions stop resistance. Very true. Searching homes, barns and cellars... ...is difficult at best. But they should all be searched. They have. Fr?ken Larsen's? - Why do you ask that? - Just because it happens to be... ...a Norwegian home. Merely a technicality. I trust Fr?ken Larsen as I do myself. Yet, for the record, thoroughness is thoroughness. It would appear rather strange if I had to search the home of the lady... ...I was about to marry. Why, I didn't know! Marriage? I had no idea! Oh, yes, I have planned it for quite some time. I had hoped that the wedding might be this week. We should be honored to have you attend, Colonel. Oh, I should be honored to come. If you'll excuse me now. Er, Major. Old Army or new, we both follow a great destiny. We should act together. Certainly, Colonel. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. You really should try this herring, it's excellent, delicious. Well, what do you expect me to say? When you announce our engagement to Col. Von Elser as though it were a communiqu?. Without even consulting me. But surely, darling, it's no surprise. Why don't you want to marry me? Have you and Von Elser set the date? It sounds more military than romantic. To the devil with Elser. He will be honored to greet you as my wife. If it were possible, I'd make it tonight. Is that romantic enough for you? Overwhelming. Only who decides the possibility of tonight, you or I? Oh, I... I must go to Alwin for a couple of days. To inspect the munitions plant. But I'll be back on Thursday. Then we shall be married. With a state ceremony. What do you think of that? Thursday? Oh, but I must have a little more time... ...to prepare for anything splendid as that. Just a few more days, perhaps. Time passes so quickly when a woman's near the man she loves. I must insist, my dear, Thursday. Allan. Nic! Oh, where have you been? I've waited for you all day. I must have walked at least fifty miles around here. Oh, darling, I'm sorry. All locked up in this cellar. Why, Dichter's jail couldn't be worse. Believe me, I've learned this much for us. Is anything wrong? I went for a drive this afternoon along the coast. You might have taken a fellow with you. I did, the major. - Or rather, he took me. - Oh? What happened? He proposed to me. Oh, what a drive. You accepted him, of course. Of course. Did he, er... set the happy day? Thursday. The night of the raid? Oh, well, that's fine. He can combine his wedding with his funeral. Allan, Dichter's going to live. I'm going to marry him. I don't quite follow, darling. What's the joke? No joke. Huh? Darling, when Dichter suspected me, he had to die. Not just to save me but to save my usefulness. Yes, but why change anything? Because I was wrong, he didn't really suspect me, it was Col. Von Elser. He put the suspicion into Dichter's mind. And his... his love or vanity made him fight it. And now his answer to Von Elser is that he wants to marry me. Don't you see what that means, dear? As his wife I'm protected. And more useful than ever. He's more useful to us. He cannot be killed. This is what you meant yesterday when you spoke about a possible change in plan. I wasn't certain yesterday, but today I'm sure. Oh, you're insane, Nic. There's only one thing for you to do and that's to go right back to England with me. Oh, Allan, I can't. And please don't talk about it anymore. It's preposterous! How long do you give yourself in this... this new relationship? I haven't the faintest idea. Do you know what the average life of a member of the Norwegian underground is? Six months, and you've been in it more than a year. Darling, one doesn't join the underground saying I'll give it a month, six months, or maybe a year and then, may I be relieved? - I know that! - One stays! But Dichter's a weak, conniving maniac! Now that Von Elser's planted the suspicion in his mind, he might turn on you the very day after you're married. Oh, Allan, you don't think it's easy for me! Don't let's have any personal feelings now. I'm trying not to. Today in Norway personal life doesn't exist. It's to be thrown away without a thought if it'll help. Yes, yes, I know. I'm sorry, darling, I do understand. But I'm trying to look at all the facts. I'm trying to see where anything useful is accomplished. How can one tell? One just waits and listens. This afternoon in the car while telling me why we'd have to wait till Thursday, he dropped that he was going to Alwin, about a munitions plant. Obviously such a plant is being built there. I sent word to Aanrud. Alwin? One such bit of information, if it were just one in a whole year, can make the difference of hundreds of lives. But Nic, there's nothing but a fish cannery at Alwin. Oh, they're probably converting it! I know this country very well. A munitions plant in Alwin would be absurd. There's no railway anywhere near there. They'd have to ship all the stuff out by sea in the face of our blockade. - No, the nazis are far from fools. - Why should he mention it? For just one reason. To make very sure of you. - A trap? - Why not? - Impossible. - What's impossible to a nazi? I don't believe it. At headquarters in England they know as much as you do. And if there were any doubt about it, they wouldn't bomb it. Well, they'd make sure. It would just cost them a few bombs to do it on their way over. And that would be all that Dichter would want to know. So that's what he's after. Nic... Nic, has the information gone? - It must have. - Well, try to stop it. - I couldn't do that. - Why not? Because you may be wrong. That's just the measure of risk in it. If everyone hesitates because of the risk, Why, I've seen fifteen-year-old children who didn't. And old men and women. Don't you think I've had to ask myself thousands of times, am I capable of as much as they're doing? This is no ordinary risk, Nic, we're talking of you and Dichter! - I see no difference! - Well, I do! In this case, instead of being corageous and heroic you're being downright stupid. Well, then I am stupid and that's the only way I know. I'm sorry, darling. I'm sorry, forgive me. I'm sorry. Maybe I was looking at this in a personal way. You're right, we'll do it your way. Dichter shall live and you're going to stay. But Major Dichter is still at Alwin. I expect him back Thursday, not before. Yes, Captain, I'll tell him as soon as he returns. It was Captain Schloss. He learned about your wedding, he'll definitely attend. Hello? Major Stengel? Oh, Major Dichter is still in Alwin. Where were you supposed to be picked up? Oh... here. At this point where I landed. Of course that was supposed to be after the raid. When I'd done the job I came for. I'd hate to be cheated of the whole show, Nic. I wish I could get down when they land and be part of the action. How could I get to that point at 11:30? I think S?ren can help you. There's an old cart we use sometimes. It's a wooden cart, would be rather slow. It would take you about an hour. You'd have to leave at 10:30. You wouldn't be back from the ceremony then, would you, Nic? No, I think not. Will I see you before you leave the house? Yes... of course, Allan. Now let me tell you the plan of the raid. The men land on either side of the town, here... and here. They come ashore at 11:30 p.m. Then they work up through the woods until they make a circle around the town. Now, all the oil dumps are inside that circle. Another hour and we shall be all starting. Good, ample time for debarkation. Yes, the weather's with us. We should be able to lug in very close. - The car is here, fr?ken. - Yes, I know. S?ren, will you get some clothes for Captain Lowell? And don't forget he'll need a gun and a watch. - Have you arranged about the cart? - Everything has been taken care of. S?ren. Will you say goodbye to Captain Lowell for me, I... I don't think I can see him. You were going without saying goodbye? Allan, I've been able to do many things, but... I was too cowardly for that. - Nic... - No! Don't come nearer, please. You're more beautiful than I've ever seen you. Goodbye, darling. Good luck, Nic. Prosit, mein Herren. Yes, Lieutenant. Pardon me, Major, I don't know how important this is, but the fish cannery at Alwin has just been bombed. It is of no importance. Major. Achtung! Pr?sentiert das Gewehr! - Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Fr?u Major Dichter. Fr?ken Larsen's home. - Yes? - There has been a change in plans. At ease. There has been a change in plans. The major and his wife will stay in town tonight... ...at her house. They say you are to leave the house. Yes, of course, I'll leave at once. - Is that you, S?ren? - Yes. I have civilian trousers for you and a sack, Captain Lowell. The cart will be here in fifteen minutes. - And here. - Ah, that's what I need, a watch. - Is it set right? - To the second. - Hm, the ceremony should be over by now. - Yes, it is. One of Dichter's men has just phoned me. They've changed their plans. Major Dichter and Fr?ken Larsen are going to spend the night here. Changed their plans? I was asked to get out of the house for the night. That's strange. I wonder why. - Sir. - Hm? Have you heard anything from Alwin? Is there any news of a bombing raid there? No, I've heard nothing. Why do you ask? Oh, I don't really know. I was trying to put something together. You'd better put those clothes on now, you haven't much time. Coordinate your watches at 10:30. Now. When she has changed her clothes and the honeymoon couple is safely on their way, I would like several men to accompany me to... Fr?ken Larsen's house. Yes, sir. I should remember to say Fr?u Major Dichter's house. Thank you. S?ren! S?ren! That's odd. I'll be down in a moment, darling. Yes, dearest. It has just sounded 11:00. Stop the engines. Full speed astern. Barges are ready to be lowered, sir. Man the barges! Good luck, fellows. Deploy the carriers and cover both flanks of men returning to beachheads. Yes, sir! Paul. What are you doing? Playing the Peer Gynt Suite. Not as well as you or... our friend the colonel. But... I'm ready to go. This is very odd. Your sudden interest in music, Paul. I'm thinking of studying. Oh, well, good. I might be able to help you. Thanks. How delightful that will be. The long winter evenings in our own home, my wife and I playing music together. I misinformed you. I didn't go to Alwin for two days. I was here. And I misinformed you again. The fish cannery in Alwin is not being converted into a munitions plant. Yes, the British bombed it tonight. And the only person I misinformed was you. My wife! So that information came from you. I'm proud to say it did! And so did St?rheimund, and Morgesson. And all the others! And all the time, of course, you were very much in love with me. I can't think of anyone I've loathed more! Are you ready to go? Go where? On out marriage trip as we planned. But we will not reach our destination. There will be an unfortunate automobile accident on the mountain road at night. The bride of Major Dichter will be killed. The major will be miraculously saved. I don't understand this elaborate way of killing me... ...when you should turn me over to the Gestapo. And in your unique way you could question me... ...and try to uncover the Stavik underground. That would be a great service to the nazi cause. But you don't do it. I wonder why. Because the spy in this case is your wife! And Berlin might not understand. They would never trust you again. They might even kick you out of the Party. We are ready to leave. Your hide above everything else in the world! That's the true stature of the nazi superman, without even the decency of loyalty to your own cause! - Shut up! - All of you are fundamentally weak, cowardly little people! Why... Nic, you have to come back to England with me now. Don't you see, Von Elser suspects you. It'll be suicide for you to stay. - The captain is right. - Yes, yes, come on, come on. Goodbye, fr?ken. God bless you. There's a car coming. Quick, quick! Isn't that Major Dichter's car? Yes, sir. - Follow it! - Yes, sir. That's not Major Dichter driving with his charming bride. Too bad they should be separated tonight of all nights. Perhaps we should turn back and have a word with Major Dichter. Not till I have a word with the man who is taking his place. Who's in that car? Can you see who it is? It's Von Elser. I think he's following us. Fire a few shots. Maybe it will stop them. He seems very anxious to get away from us. - How far are the oil dumps? - About three or four miles. We'll pass them on this road. - Allen, what time will the blow-off be? - Oh, we've plenty of time. Unless this German car has too much ersatz in it. No more wires to come, sir? Be sure everyone's clear before you punch that time clock. Yes, sir. What time is it? Seven minutes past twelve. Allan, tell me the truth. How much time have we? Three minutes. At 12:10 the oil dumps are going. So is the road. We've got to be on the other side. One more wiring party to come, sir. All wiring parties accounted for, sir. Fifty-five seconds. Twenty seconds. The oil dumps! I hope the lad with the plunger doesn't get itchy fingers. Five seconds. - Von Elser. - Good. Look out! - Allan! - Oh, hello, old boy. Noisy brutes, aren't you? That was a narrow escape. I never expected you on this road. Good your wife gave you a watch for Christmas. Kept hoping she'd spared no expense. - Hello, Smith, hi, Roberts. - Glad to see you, sir. Oh... oh, Miss Larsen. Captain Langdon. - So glad you're safe. - Thank you. Well, a sea trip will do us all good. That's the nearest way to the beach. Go ahead. We'll hang around for a few minutes in case we've missed anything. All right. By the way, Allan... Speaking of missing anything, did you, er... I didn't miss a thing, old man. There it is, in the back of the car. Splendid. We'll see the nazis find him in a good place. All right. Don't look back, darling, don't. - Allan. - Yes, dear. I'm the widow of a German hero. Do you realize what that means? - What... what are you talking about? - It's too good an opportunity to miss. Von Elser dead too, There'll be a new Commandant, he'll respect me. I'll have his confidence. I must go back. Have you gone mad, Nic? Oh, but don't you see, dear, I'm above suspicion now. Well, I won't have it. You've done more than your share, more than any woman could be expected to do. I'll quit when you quit. I have a chance to fight back, you haven't No, Nic, we're not saying goodbye again ever. Oh, but darling, it isn't that kind of a world anymore. People don't dance, and laugh, and ski... as we once used to. They still love. I'll never stop doing that, Allan. That's the answer I want. It's you and I together, Nic, from now on. The better we do our job, the fewer will go back like that. If I could save just one... if that one is you. - Yes, but darling... - I'm not being noble, dear. Just selfish, very, very selfish. Like any woman in love. We've been very lucky. We've had something. A great deal. We'll be shoving off directly, Allan. All right. - See you in the barge, Miss Larsen. I want to kiss you, Allan. You're not going back, I won't let you. I want to kiss you. And no more talk of going back. No more talk. Hello, officer. I'm afraid I forgot to duck. Oh, hello, Jackson, what rotten luck. Well, it's not so bad at that. A few weeks in the country, pretty nurses, maybe a medal. You were always the one to come out on top. See you in England, Jackson. Nic. Nic! Nic! Nic! Nic! Hurry, Allan, they're shoving off. Nic! Nic! Captain Lowell! Captain Lowell! Report to barge Number 1. Well, that's that. We got everything we came for. Oh, I don't know. There's still a lot of unfinished business. We'll be coming back. You can depend on that. - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
