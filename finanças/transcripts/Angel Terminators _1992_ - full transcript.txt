I remember a time when flowers would flourish. Tears come to my eyes as my gaze rests upon the moon. I have no control over my emotions, drowning in sorrow. If you can read my heart, no need for a goodbye. I have no control over my emotions. If you can read my heart, no need for a goodbye. Take care of yourself, leave your worries behind. Perhaps when we meet again, our gazes will barely meet. Your love cries in silence, its heart broken, forever missing you. Brother Jian, it's almost time. Wait for me here. Wei, brother Jian doesn't want to leave! - The situation is critical! Brother Jian, stay calm. I'll do what's necessary here, in Hong Kong. Look! It's Zeng Jian! It's him! Follow him, quick! Ok sir! Wei, call Central for reinforcements! Yes sir! This is agent Chen Zhiwei. Suspect vehicules are heading toward Hang Hau. Asking for reinforcements to block their route. Over. Received! We're going. Over. Let's go! - Long, cut through the hill, we'll wait for them there. - Okay! Stop! Stop moving! Go in! Brother Jian, flee! Brother Jian, just flee, quick! You have everything you need? To be honest, I don't think so. What do you need now? A good friend like you! Oh you're so generous! You really are always complimenting. I'm warning you, during your training in Scotland, don't do anything stupid, especially don't start flirting with white boys! Come on, they're not my type. But I can't help it if they approach me! What if you came back with Prince Charles? That would be awesome! Stop dreaming. Think about it, you sure you didn't forget anything? Yes, ah, I did!!! Stop! Xiaohong, you forgot your vest. Thanks, sister-in-law. Thanks! Well, lucky for you that you have such a sweet sister-in-law, otherwise... Hurry up! or you could watch the plane leave! Don't worry Carrie, and be sure to look after my cousin. Of course. - Bye! - See you! Call me when you arrive! Okay. Bye! Stop! Stop! Stand up. Stop! This is a call to all patrols. Robbery in a Kowloon jeweller's shop, suspects have killed an agent. They're now in a kindergarten in Jiajia. A teacher and a dozen kids are inside kept hostage. All patrols are summoned as back-up. This is agent Chen, received! We're coming. Over. Are you crazy? You have a flight coming up, leave that to the others. Let's fix that first, okay? Be calm, stop crying, don't be afraid. Hey, how you holding up? - Get that bitch out of here! - Yes, you! Outside! Now! No... Come on! Fast! Stand up! Outside! Up! Get out of here! Stop! My son! - Stop! - My son Stop! My son is inside. He's epileptic. He needs this medecine! One moment. Boss. One of the kids is epileptic, his mom is here. He needs treatment. - Take care of her. - Okay. Come here. Mom... He's destroying my ears! Take him away! - Okay! Come on, up! Stop crying! Stop! I'll make you cry, just you see! I'm going around. Listen inside! There's an epileptic kid among the hostages. His mom is here, she must give him his medecine. If he doesn't take it right now, his life is in danger. You think I'm an idiot! Please! let me in, they're just pills! My son needs them! This kid's not looking well. I'm not lying, let me in please! You, tell him, please, help me! Let me in, please! Okay, but you better not try anything stupid. Don't worry! She's going in alone. Okay, send the mother in. Stop! Don't move! I only want to give that to my son. - Come in! - Careful! Come here sweetie, don't be afraid, mom is here. We have an additional hostage it seems. It will be okay, don't worry. Come on, outside! Look! They came out! We're gonna deal with them, move! Congratulations Madam, you make miracles happen even with a plane to catch! Stop making fun of me. That's enough. You will miss your plane. Yes... We're going. Bye! Enjoy your trip! - Come, let's take a look. - Okay. - Wei. - Brother Jian! Let's go! Seven years... I didn't think things would change that much. Wei, you've done some good work. Brother Jian, this place has been waiting for you for seven years. This time, we'll see to it that you dominate over this place like mount Taishan. Good. Brother Jian, what you asked for is on the table in front of you. It's payback time! Cheers! Brother Bin, everyone's here already, we were waiting for you. You dare say that I'm late? - Brother Bin... Enough, spare me your crap. Who did this? Tell me right now! If I find out by myself, I'll kill whoever did this and their family. Is it you? Brother Bin, you know me, why would I do such a thing? Then it must be you! I would never do this, brother Bin. Brother Bin. Tieding, you're always the one stirring up the pot. Even if you ran out of merchandise, it's not a good enough reason to steal mine. What? Brother Bin, I am reckless I know, but not to the point of stealing from you. Indeed? Brother Jian, you came back and yet you told me nothing. I would have prepared a greeting diner. You're not greeting him? Brother Jian. Brother Jian. Bin, everyone here knows I was back. Except you. Come on, why do you take it this way? We're still cousins. We can sit down and discuss this. No we don't have anything left to discuss. Actually, you still remember that I am your cousin? When you stumbled here ten years ago, I gave you a whole territory to work with. I closed my eyes to your dealings... And you allied with the cops to screw me! What? I'm also a godfather... Be careful of what you say! You, a godfather? If you are so, then oppose me directly, instead of plotting in the shadows, and forcing me to flee into Thailand for seven years. Seven years of suffering. Do you know why your merchandise is disappearing? Because I've decided that I was done with you! I'm back! And I will take back what is mine! You're a dead man! Die! Stop! Stop this nonsense! Idiot! I took Bin's stuff. I split it in four equal parts. One for each of you. So in the future, if you need something, anything, contact me. Bin's death... is ambivalent information. It's both a good and a bad thing. Yang, I'll let you explain it to everyone? Yes. During Bin's funeral, we filmed some images secretely. The objective was to understand who would become the new godfather after Bin's death. Attending the funerals were the "big four", Rong, Tieding, Paowangbiao, and Fatal Xiong. But we also managed to spot a surprise guest. Who? Today, we know next to nothing about him, except that he's a Chinese coming from Thailand. His name is Sawa Da. He came back recently. We know that he's a boss in the Rifuda Group, apart from that, nothing. So that was the bad news I was talking about earlier. The status of Hong Kong criminality is all over the place currently. We will be monitoring their actions closely. Ada, you're one of our best agents. You should lead the investigation. Yes, sir. Sir, I suspect that Sawa Da is a fugitive who fled the country. I'm ready to apprehend him. Ada, we're policemen, we need proof before arresting someone. He's right, we need to act according to the rules, Understood? Yes, sir. Honey, enough shopping for now. You're gonna kill me if this goes on! Why? You gamble a lot more in races. I'm afraid our closet is gonna blow up. It's your head I'm gonna blow up! I only wanted to buy a leather suit for Xiaohong. It's his birthday next week. You're his cousin, you should remember. I remember your birthday, that's what matters. That's right! Wait for me here. All right. Hello... it's me. Oh... Xiaoyang, what's up? Poker? Cool, see you at the club at 8:30 PM. Okay, see you later. Hey. Help! Thief! Stop! Don't move! Stop moving! Get out of the way! Stop! Drop your knife! Hands on your head! Now! Drop it, right now! Don't move! Don't move! Don't move! Don't do anything stupid! Zhiyuan, save me! Drop your gun! Hurry! - No... - Or else I'm gonna kill her! Zhiyuan, watch out! Let's go! Zhiyuan! Are you okay? Catch them! - I'm all right. - You scared me. Honey, don't worry! Turns out it's not so easy to kill your man. We still have to celebrate our seven years together. You're still making jokes, I'm worried. Don't worry, I'm not gonna die. Damn, we lost again. Let's go. Mei! Brother Qing, brother Long. No luck huh, stumbling on us! Thinking about paying us back soon? With what money? No boyfriend, no rich clients, no luck in gambling games either. What do you want me to do? Shit! Bitch! Give us our cash back! Quit your bullshit! Let me go! We're gonna beat you up! Enough! What do you think you're doing? Ah, sorry Madam! We're leading! Sorry! You okay? I didn't know you could fight! You just noticed? So, where is he? That's what you wanted, Sawa Da's finger prints. Which were on this glass. But those two retards broke it! Clearly it's useless now, got anything else? Yes, but I'm really afraid right now. Oh that fixes things, I'm no longer afraid! Tell me quickly. There's an event at Club Xingda tonight. I know Sawa Da will be there. I'll keep an eye on him if you want. I'm going, see you! Here, two glasses! Cheers! Yes, that's right... Enjoy the evening! So many people tonight! Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Thank you, thank you! Make a wish before blowing the candles. Yes, that's right! Make a wish. Bravo! - Brother Jian. - Ming. How's the godfather? Very well, thanks to you brother Jian. Sit down. Apparently the crops are overflowing, what's your price? If that's okay with you, it'll be the same price as last time. Good, very good. When will I receive the merchandise? Friday the 13th, at 9 PM. Where? The furniture warehouse. Let me introduce you. Mei, this is mister Liang. Take very good care of him tonight, understood? And you too. Of course. Have fun! - I'll let you handle this. - Okay. - Is it the first time you come to Hong Kong? - I come here often. - Oh yes? - You're staying in which hotel? - Jinghua. Did you have time to visit? - Not yet. - Let's go together. Carrie, it's been years since I last saw you. Want to catch up with a drink? You're mad at me right? It was my fault. There you are. Are you okay? Are you feeling well? No, I'm fine. A friend of yours? Will you introduce us? This is my husband, Jin Zhiyuan. To whom do I owe the pleasure? Sawa Da. Nice to meet you! I'll leave you. Honey, what's going on? Nothing, just an old friend. Come, let's go inside. Greetings miss, your invitation please? - Congratulations! - Thanks! Boss, come on, another one! Sawa Da! Been a long time. You left so quickly, we didn't even have time to say goodbye. Sorry miss, but our boss doesn't know you. Leave, please. Relax, everyone, relax ! Please accept our apologies. Ada, what are you doing? This is a private property. You need a warrant. Don't do anything stupid. You have nothing to gain here, and you know it. Leave please. I have something to say. Stop your bullshit right now, this is an order, understood? Don't worry about me. All right. Even if you've changed your name, you haven't changed your career. You should be careful, Zeng Jian. Hello, Madam. You seem in a hurry, have any information? - Go, I'll explain. - All right. I was listening at the door yesterday night, A guy from Thailand told Sawa Da there will be a drug deal Friday the 13th at 9 PM at the furniture warehouse. I thought it would interest you, so I contacted you. Anything else? No, that's all I could hear. You can drop me off here. Thanks! Here. You really are a kind woman, thanks! Bye! See you! Silly girl... Steven, it seems everything is going well, don't you think? Police, listen up, you're surrounded. Surrender and lay down your weapons now! Fire Let's get out of here! Miss Qianqian, take this money and leave with Zhaobo. What about you, brother Wei ? - Leave! - Okay! Trying to flee? Stop! The barrel. - Let's split up! - Okay! Halt! Brother Wei! Miss Qianqian, leave! Bring the money back! - I don't want to! - Leave! Punish me. Good work! We found a huge quantity of drugs. But we still have no idea who was the leader of the operation. Commissioner, in light of this deal I found that close friends of Sawa Da participated in the operation. Therefore I think... Ada, material proof is the single most important concept in Hong Kong law. We can't convict him without proof. Don't do anything stupid! But he's... Remember that, you gotta be patient in order to catch a big fish. You weren't very patient at the club. Your catch will flee if they feel cornered, understand? Yes, sir. Brother Jian, our supply lines are completely cut. Even if we can still find some product, the prices are ridiculous, it's gonna be almost impossible to make a profit. If we have nothing to sell, it could spell the end of this organization. We can't find anything under HK$100 million. This last failure made us lose face. My dear brothers, I thank you for your support and for staying with me through these difficult times. As for our supply line, don't worry about it too much! I've already met with Samak. This is going to be dealt with. This time the merchandise will arrive from different routes. Even if we lose some, it will be fine. They won't get us so easily. As for the police, I, Zeng Jian, promised I would destroy anybody who gets in my way. Mister Jin, here's one million in chips. - You have 2 million in total. - Okay, thanks. Sign here please. What is it? I burned myself. You always make beef soup for my cousin. He's so lucky to have you! Xiaohong, how can you say that? I've made some for you too, right? But you didn't want to eat it. Oh snap! What is it now? I forgot to tell your cousin to come back home for dinner. He's that busy right now? I think so... You know him, he works hard. Mister Jin, your turn to bet. Two hundred thousand. Mister Li, two hundred thousand, do you call? Two hundred thousand... - I fold. - Me too. Mister Jin, it's a beautiful hand you have there! He's bluffing, he always does it. You can call and see for yourself. Mister Zhang, your call? There's more than a million on this table, and you'd win it all with just a two hundred thousand bet? Not so fast! Mister Jin, how much chips do you have? Five hundred thousand. All right, I call, then I raise. Five hundred thousand. Good, I think it's my lucky day! I call! Look at that. Sometimes, Mister Hong, luck comes around. I'm sorry, but I have triple kings! He does have triple kings. Mister Jin, I need to tell you this, you ose us two million in total. Would you kindly pay us back within three days? If you don't, I'll be forced to contact my boss. Thank you. Don't move. Police! What is this? Open it up! Here's my phone number, call me whenever you like. All right. oh yeah, and I learned from my brothers That Mister Jin had financial problems. Is he in trouble? Mister Jin, we've been waiting for three days. Keep this up and we'll be forced to contact the authorities. Zhiyuan! Zhiyuan! What's going on? - What the hell are you doing? - Sorry. Nothing, everything is fine. Mister Jin, I'm so sorry, the amount is too big, my boss refused your request. But you have already verified my records. Everything is in order. Yes, but you're asking for 2 million, it really is a lot. Also, your apartment payments are still going through. So... All right, I get it, I'll go see another bank. Another bank? You can try... But they won't accept your request. Hello, brother Jian, it's Rong. Yes, I've done what you asked. Honey, you're not changing? You're smoking again? What are you doing? What are you talking about? I'm your wife, don't lie to me, okay? I've never lied to you! You're mad at me because I work too much and we don't see each other enough? No, that's not it. How much debts do you have? Not much. Not much? 2 million is not much? How do you know that? Who told you? Honey... We've been together for a while. You think I don't know you? How will you find all that money? They're always going to be after you. You know very well that I can't live without you... - Honey! - How could I? Zhiyuan, did you think about me? Don't worry, I will find a solution. So what brings you here, Carrie? You knew I would come. So, what can I do for you? Brother Jian, 2 million for you, it's nothing. Of course it's nothing. But... Why should I help you? Actually, there might be a way. It depends on you. Why? I want you in exchange. What? It wouldn't be the first time. All right. What did you say? I can't hear you. Speak louder. I said all right. Oh that looks bad! Let's take a look! Fast! Call an ambulance! Madam! Wei! Wei! Wei! Madam... flee! Let's go! Let's leave! Hello. Great work! Listen. Find a quiet place and hide the stuff. Here's your husband's debt. What were you thinking?! How will I explain that to management? Huh? Ada, I want a written report now! I have to go, keep me posted. Ada, director Jin isn't behaving normally! He's always very concerned about the lives of his men, - But today... - Got it... Honey. - I'm back. - Ah, there you are! Honey, I have great news. I dealt with my debt. Honey. I promise to you I will never gamble again! Honey. What do you like most? Canada or the USA? I... I think you'll prefer Canada. You told me... You told me you'd prefer a quiet place. Let's do this, all right? I will write and submit my resignation letter, okay? You want to quit? Why? You love your job, you said so yourself. It's true. But we all need change once in a while, right? You're hiding something from me, tell me what's going on. Tell me! Don't touch me! Tell me! Honey, honey... why are you mad? I'll tell you everything. The drug deal that's going on, I gave them information. They told me if they got the merchandise, they would erase my debt, and they would give me 3 million. You... Honey, come on, if I hadn't done that, where would I find the money? What's done is done, and that's it. You're so dumb! Honey! Honey! Honey! Don't take it this way. Come out! Honey! Mister Jin, you're right on time. Let's cut the chase. Where's my receipt and the money? The receipt and the money? I don't have any of that. You don't have them? Are you trying to screw me? She had nothing to do with it, I'm the one who screwed you. Sawa Da! You can call me that. But your wife still calls me brother Jian. Strange, no? She didn't tell you anything? All right, then I'll tell you. Carrie, she's like one of my used pair of shoes, that I wore a lot, and that you're wearing now. Got it? I don't care about the past. Where's my receipt and my money? The receipt? Ask Carrie. She really didn't tell you anything? How did she get the receipt? It's quite simple, by getting naked with me. You dipshit! I haven't done anything wrong. You're mad or simply jealous? I, Zeng Jian, am feared by everyone, your wife is mine, and I have no reason to tolerate your presence here. Bastard! Mister Jin. There are a lot of women out there. I don't hold grudges, so why are you so mad at me? Today, you came only to collect your hard-earned money. But what matters is that we collaborate in good faith starting now. You reap, I sow. And I even have a scapegoat too! Perfect, no? Fucking bastard! Don't move! Sir, don't take any risks now, calm down. So you came here with a minion? I'm not a minion, I came here to arrest you! Arrest me? Mister Jin, she said she would arrest me! Looks like we're both taking the fall. Sir, don't do anything stupid. Drop your weapon! Even if you kill me, you won't escape justice. I told you to drop your weapon! You can't violate the law! Drop your weapon! Jin Zhiyuan! I love our new collaboration, don't you love it too? Shut up! Ada, I didn't want to do this. I didn't have a choice. Yes, you did. Drop your weapon. Mister Jin, always keep an eye on your associate. - Take care of her. - Yes! The body is there. Look around for the murder weapon. - I'm taking pictures. - Okay. Look, there! You're certain my cousin was killed by Ada's gun? We already have the lab report. The two bullets that killed the commissioner are exactly the same as those contained in this pistol. Look. Xiaohong, I know it might be hard to comprehend and accept. But after the commissioner's death, Ada disappeared completely. So... So, you suspect that Ada killed my cousin. We didn't find Ada's prints on the gun. However, we have crippling evidence against her. I hope you understand. This is why you brought me back right in the middle of my formation? Not only that- We'd like for you to replace Ada in the meantime. Another thing, Director Huang, is the commissioner's wife aware that Ada is a suspect? No, not right now. Our announcement for now is that commissioner Jin committed suicide. I fear that if the truth came out, it... ...would have a negative impact on the police force, is that it? Yes, Xiaohong, I hope you understand. I understand. Sister-in-law, my condolences! Xiaohong! Xiaohong. Come on now, calm down. What would he think if he saw you like this, huh? Your cousin didn't kill himself, he would never do that! Now now, stop crying, calm down. Xiaohong, you're police as well. Surely you know the real cause of his death. Calm down. No! Tell me the truth! Your cousin would never kill himself. Tell me the truth. Please just calm down, please? Are you all right? You're a tough guy! Brother Samak, call from Hong Kong. Hello. Hello, Samak? Brother Jian here. I'm onto something big, and I need your help. If it works, I am returning to Thailand with you, and no more problems. I'm in! I've prepared for everything, come here quickly. I'm leaving now. Brother Jian, a certain Carrie wishes to see you. - Let her in. - Okay. Commissioner Jin's death saddens me greatly. Stop your nonsense, you look like a cat mourning the death of a rat. You're the one who murdered my husband! That's funny! Your husband was beyond saving. You knew him well enough. It's his taste for gambling that led him to a tragic end. It's true, I laid down a trap for him. I was also the one who ordered his death. But when you think about it, your husband's death suits us both, don't you think? Look at you, did you even look at yourself? What does Jin Zhiyuan have that I don't? So? Speak! Hard to tell, huh? Let me go! You think you're a princess? You're just a whore! Whatever I used to own, Zeng Jian, no one can touch! Whore. Brother Jian. Yes! Carrie. Who's that? It's me, Ada. Who's there? Doctor is here! We're gonna play a game today. I will give the content of this needle to the one who crawls faster. I told you to crawl! On all fours! Give it to me! Mine! Mine! Mine! Nothing on this side. Same here. Me neither, nothing here. Nothing. Okay, you two look around there. I'll go see the boss. - Let's go. - All right. So? Madam, we can't find Mei. Ada, leave, fast! No, you're leaving with me! Ada, run! Fast! Run! We're out of time! Quick! Carrie. Help... Mei, it's me! Madam? What happened to you? Help me! How did you manage to get into this mess? You know that, like, the whole world is looking for you? How can I possibly help you? Mei, we'll talk later. I need somewhere to hide. A place to hide? How can I find such a place? Mei, you're the only one who can help me. You should ask Xiaohong. Xiaohong is back? No, I can't go see her. Hey, it's disgusting here. Come on, forget about it, let's go! Mei. Madam, leave me alone okay? I'm sorry, I really can't help you. Mei, Mei! Sorry. Mei, Mei! Madam, I was just kidding. Did I scare you? So, what happened to you? You can tell me everything. You have to hold on! Madam, I know it's hard for you! But you have to hold on, Madam! Madam! Madam! You came back? Do you feel better? A lot better. I brought you some rice grits. I will help you. Come here! What do you want? Madam wants to see you. I told you, I don't know anything! Oh you think so? We'll see about that. Come in. Madam, why are you always looking for me? You think I'm a soothsayer or something? The police suspects that Ada murdered the commissioner. Talk, or you'll be in trouble! Mei, I'm the only one who can help you now. Tell me where Ada is and I'll help you go in hiding. Here Madam, this is my place. You really think she's hiding in this junkyard? Long, go check upstairs. Yes madam. Where do you think you're going? Madam, stop snooping around! I told you she wasn't here. How do you explain then this bed and the sheets? And this bowl, still hot? Where's Ada? What a load of nonsense. Look, I'm dumb, and I lost all my money gambling. I don't have anything left! All I have for tonight is a bowl of soup, okay? Madam, I looked everywhere, there's no one here. Ada. Ada! I know you're hiding here. Come out! Madam, my time is valuable. Feel free to Keep looking like idiots without me. Bye! Ada. I know you're here. How long will you keep on hiding? Yes, police is looking for you. But I think you're innocent. If you really are innocent Why not come out and explain yourself? Where's your pride? We're friends, we're partners even. You won't believe even me? Will you just stay hidden here until the end of time? All right then! As you wish! Stay hidden all your life! - Long, we're leaving! - Madam! Mei! Mei! What's going on? Mei! Xiaohong! Long! Xiaohong! Xiaohong! Xiaohong, are you okay? Ada, come back with me! Xiaohong, I know you only want what's best for me. But as long as this business is going on I'm not coming back with you. Why do you have to be so stuborn? Even if Jin has been shot with your gun, your prints aren't on it. The best you can do right now is to go back to the station and explain the situation to our superiors. Explain? What for? I'll be suspended anyway no matter what. I'm not gonna be able to do anything. Don't you think? Xiaohong, I'll tell you what happened. Zeng Jian is the one who killed your cousin! He also killed your sister-in-law, Carrie. What? Carrie too... Carrie saved my life, she sacrificed herself to save me! I wanna kill Zeng Jian! I will avenge Carrie! Zeng Jiang! Zeng Jiang! Zeng Jiang! You fucking bastard! Samak, this is for you. Brother Jian, what does that mean? Nothing. I summon you here to assist me, this is to help cover the costs. Brother Jian, you've always been incredibly generous with us in Thailand. I'm not gonna ask you for money for a service like this! Thank you. By the way, brother Jian, when all this is over, what are your next projects? I'm gonna leave Hong Kong. Because I found a new place that's simply better than Hong Kong. When the time comes, we'll share the spoils, brother! Excellent! That way brother, we will both have an incredible retirement. Ada Ada Ada!
