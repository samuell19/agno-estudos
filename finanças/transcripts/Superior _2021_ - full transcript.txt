Oh, God. Marian. Marian. I just wanted to talk to you. Stop. Go away! Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to get out of the vehicle. Get out of the fucking car. Stop. Marian stop! We're supposed to have sex today. Hmm? It's on the calendar. Okay. Hello? Vivian? Hey, Weis had a special on Halloween candy. Three bags for $4.99. I ah-I picked up a little extra cause I know we ran out early last year. I know you don't like having extra sugar in the house. But I figured we'll find some way to get rid of it. What's that? Your sister. She was here when I got home. She drank all the milk. You're still listed as Rivera. When did you get married? Marian, what is this? What? I haven't heard from you in six years. And you just show up without warning? I have a recording session in the city this weekend so I figured I'd come see you. How long are you staying? Not long. You can't smoke in here. Sorry. Why didn't you ever call? I had no idea where you were. It's hard to explain. Try. I can't. Okay, so then what do you want from me? Just let me stay here a few days, please. Fine. What are you doing? It's freezing out. I'm winterizing the garden. I wanna hit up some of our old spots today. What are you up to? I have a lot to do. Like what? I have to finish gardening. I have some laundry to do. I need to put up some more Halloween decorations. Gotta get some more milk and maybe something for dinner. All right. I could use some help. Oh, now? Have you ever gardened? Uh No. You have to cut the dead parts. So they'll grow back. So where have you been? All over. What does that mean, all over? I flew in a few days ago from Paris. Paris? What brought you there? I was on tour, I'm in a band. I noticed you don't have a car. Nah, I took the bus. I can't believe it's snowing already. Isn't that the Johnson's old house? Yeah. They still live there. Wow. I thought Lenny Johnson was the love of my life. What? Yeah. You two were a thing? I used to sneak out at night to see him. Oh, I know. You did? We slept in the same room. I just didn't know who you were going to see. Lenny Johnson Yeah. Let's get a drink. It's three o'clock. I've never been here before. You and Michael don't go out? Not lately. I'm home all day and then by the time he gets home from work he's so exhausted he never wants to leave the house. He seems sweet. He is. How did you know I'll still be here? I guess I didn't. I just hoped you'd be. I never left. Can you believe it? Yeah, well it seems like you have a nice thing going. What's Paris like? Hmm? You said you were just there. Yeah, it was pretty nice. Pretty nice? That's it? Yeah, we were only there a few days. Requests? ♪ See me ♪ ♪ See you ♪ ♪ See us we are laughing ♪ Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Do you remember when I had that giant bump on my forehead? I remember when I had that giant bump on my forehead. No, that was me. It was Lindsay Malone. We were in second grade. She swung the door open and hit me right here. I had a bump on my forehead for like a week. You always do this to me. Do what? You take my memories. I remember how it felt. What does that even mean? What? That he looks like he's lactose intolerant. I don't know, something about his face. $17.27. - Viv. - Oh. Oh, you're home. We got dinner, it'll be ready in an hour. Oh, we got plenty of Chinese food left over. Are you drunk? Hold on. It was my fault. You into coins? No. Marian. Remember when you cut your hair like a boy? Yeah. Oh, here we go. Show me. It was you. I told you. Class is about to start. I think I'm gonna watch a while. You're not supposed to eat in here. March in place. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

I don't really know much punk music. You want another? I'm okay. I should probably start heading home. Oh. Okay. It's really nice meeting you though. Goodnight. Honey. Wake up. What's wrong? Nothing. We need to take your temperature. Where's your... Did you move the thermometer? Oh, it's in the drawer. Okay. The house is a mess. So clean up. Yeah. Yeah, |I can help. What? How long do you think Marian's gonna be staying here? I don't know. A few days? It's been a week. ♪ I'm in a trance. ♪ It's not a hotel. Well. She'll be gone soon. 98.1. Still? ♪ I'm in a trance. ♪ Don't you think she's been acting kind of suspicious? What do you mean? Well, she said she's here for a recording session in the city. So where's her band? I don't know, she doesn't tell me anything. Yeah, exactly. And Paris? I mean, what band goes from Paris to Hornell? We haven't seen each other in six years. Lets just, just cut her some slack. Oh, I know. She's family, she can stay as long as she wants. I'm just saying she needs to pitch in. And you could get back to your routine too. You haven't really been acting yourself since Marian's been here. Okay. I'll talk to her. Thank you. Good morning. We're out of milk again. I know. What's wrong? Nothing, Michael's being annoying. Do you wanna get some ice cream? Sure. I'll finish the dishes. Thanks. One scoop of vanilla on a sugar cone, please. Okay. What do you want? Two scoops of chocolate with chocolate sprinkles on a waffle cone. Sounds good. Don't you have to be in the city this weekend? Oh, no. I forgot to tell you our deal got pushed. How long? It's kinda up in the air for now. Is that okay? Yeah. Yeah, of course. But? It's Michael. He wants you to chip in for groceries, milk. I don't have a lot of extra cash right now, but I will. How? Don't worry. I said I will. This place is hiring. So? You can work here. Are you kidding me? You can stay as long as you want, but you have to contribute. Go talk to the guy. Fine. Okay, so here's the deal. My parents own this place. It's been in my family for years. My mom is having me work here the whole year alone. She told my dad it's to teach me responsibility or some bullshit. But the truth is, she lost all our employees when she threatened to start drug testing. Oh. Don't worry. She's not gonna drug test you. She was never going to drug test anyone. Yeah, that seems pretty intense for an ice cream shop. She's out of her mind. She's crazy. Anyway, I'm working on getting Suzy and Pablo back. But in the meantime, I'm really gonna need you here. Great. Welcome to the family. Hey. Hi. What can I get for you? I'll have a chocolate swirl with sprinkles and marshmallow. Okay, anything else? He wants a coffee. Sure. What's going on? There's someone I know. I can't go out there. Who? He's gonna hurt me. What's up Jerry? Sorry about that by the way. The usual? Don't worry about it. No, just a coffee and an ice cream. Oh wait, this is your mom's. She's expecting that, all right. Make sure he gets it. Okay. What was that about? Sorry. I got confused. Won't happen again. I was gonna say, Jerry doesn't tip well but wouldn't hurt a fly. Are you gonna go back out there? Robert Mix '85. Yeah! Hi you're home. Yeah. Wow. Honey, you look so- I was just goofing off. No, no. You really look- - Really? - Yeah. Where's your sister? Work. She got a job? Honey, let's go downstairs. This isn't the best position. Let's go downstairs. Pillow. Thank you. Hello. Hey, it's me. Marian. Oh, my God. I'm so glad to hear your voice. You disappeared. We freaked out when you didn't show to practice last week. I know, I'm sorry. Where are you? I'm back home. Shit, what happened? Are you okay? Yeah, it's just-family emergency. Everything's fine now. Okay, good. We leave tomorrow, can you make it back? No, I should stick around a while longer. But I can make some calls. Billy got a friend to fill in. But she's struggling. Shit. Sorry. We'll manage. Hey, you haven't seen Robert. Have you? No. Why? Never mind. Sure everything's okay? Yeah, I'm good. Hi. Hi. Everything okay? Yeah. You can't smoke in here. I told you Michael has allergies. I need this. I had a rough day. It's serving ice cream. What could be so bad? The customers are awful. Some guy yelled at me for mixing up flavors. And the toilet clogged. And there's not enough cigarette breaks. And it kinda smells in there. Well, it's work. It's not supposed to be fun. Most jobs take some getting used to. Well, I'm not gonna stick around to find out. You have to. No, I don't. You can't stay here if you don't chip in. I really need to work on my music. I thought you said your deal got pushed. It did, but we're recording a new song of mine and it's not ready. Can you work for me tomorrow? No. I have a life to. Please, one day. You mean like what? We switch places? Yeah. It's not like we haven't before. Yeah, people mixing us up isn't the same thing. True. You'd have to cover for me here. Great. Yeah. I can work on my song. Fine. One day. Thank you. So Miles is the guy who hired me. He's all right. What about the job? All you have to do is give people what they ask for. Sounds easy enough. Oh, and clean up. I can do that. What do I do? Uhm. We need some groceries. Got it. You have a tattoo? Oh, yeah. Pretty stupid huh? I like it. Let me see. I forgot what this feels like. Hey. Oh, you're early. That's good. You left your apron here yesterday. Sorry. I guess you can do that but you should probably be washing it, you know. Yeah, I'll take it. I didn't touch it. It's where you left it yesterday. Cool. Marian, it's on the shelf. Right. Thanks. You got bangs. Yeah.

What's your favorite? Mint chip. Mine too So two mint chips? Yes, please Cup or cone? Cone. Good afternoon, Ms. Rivera? Yes. Your sister is Marian Dalton? Yes. Can I help you? Have you heard from Marian this past week? I haven't heard from my sister in six years. I see. What's going on? Oh, well we got a call about a car a couple of days ago. Someone abandoned it at a bus depot about 20 miles from here. The driver's side window was smashed. Oh, God. Yeah, the car was registered under Marian's name. Have you talked to Marian? We haven't been able to reach her. Or her husband. They live in Buffalo? I don't know. I think so. Is someone looking for Marian? There's no need to panic, Ms. Rivera. When we find a car like that we have to follow up. For now, we'll keep it in our lot. Just let us know if you hear anything. That's my extension. Of course. Honey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Hey. Hey, we never lock the front door. It's a safe neighborhood. Oh, okay. What are you doing? Oh, I'm making dinner. It'll be ready soon. Okay. We have to change. I'll meet you upstairs. Today, went surprisingly well. I don't think Miles noticed anything. That's not surprising. Did he play video games all day? Yeah. You didn't tell me he was 16. He's cool though. How'd it go here? It was okay. It was pretty uneventful. Did you finish your song? No. I worked on it a lot though. You know, you made this job sound awful but it's actually pretty fun. People are happy when they're eating ice cream and you're happy because you're providing them with what's probably the best part of their day. Wow! Listen to you. Does that mean you'll go back tomorrow? No. You said one day. I need more time. Besides who knows, if you play your cards right Miles might make you employee of the week. Shut up. Please? Hey hon, have you seen my Crescent Club tin? It's not on the shelf. Maybe it's in the den. Dinner's ready. What are those things? Antique tobacco tins. I collect them. You used to smoke? God no. Never. Smoking kills. Yeah. What is this? It's sweet potato casserole. Are these marshmallows? Mm hmm. Yeah, this was my favorite meal growing up. How thoughtful of you. So how's it going at Riley's? I really can't complain. It's a good job. That's great. Yeah, I mean people are happy when they're eating ice cream and you're happy because you're providing them with what's probably the best part of their day. That's beautiful. And Viv tells me you're in a band? Yeah. Nice. You guys must be pretty big. Why? Well, she said you had a show in Paris. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I mean, we're starting to get a following. What are you called? The Error. The Error? Like the mistake? Yep. Okay. Hey. Marian. What are you doing? You want some? Come on. Don't go. Let's stay in tonight. You mean get wasted. No. I'll make us dinner. We can listen to some music. There she is. Hey, Marian. Hey. I owe you your tips today. So do not leave without them. Okay. If you need me, I'm definitely gonna be here. Okay. Hey Marian, do you have a lighter? Nope. Do you have any matches? No. Sorry. I thought you smoked. Oh, I quit. Okay. Oh wait, I think we have a lighter where the birthday candles are. Oh, yes. Yeah we do. Thank you. I'm gonna smoke a joint, you want a little? What if someone comes in? We're closed. That mystery has been solved. Digital, we took the mystery out of computers. Your tune up will really depend on the size of your engine. For four cylinder engine, its $49. For six cylinder engine it's $55. And for eight is $59. And that's for most cars, most makes and models. Just 60 minutes tuning and our work is guaranteed for six months for 6,000 miles. So are you from here? I am. Never seen you before. I left for a while. Where'd you go? All over the place. I'm in a band so we travel together a lot. Why'd you come back? I'm not really sure to be honest. How long have you been gone for? Can we talk about something else? Oh, sure. Do you like working here? Yeah, I do. I think I'm getting the hang of it. Oh, you're great. To be honest I'm not even sure why you'd wanna work here in the first place. It's been nice getting out of the house. My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for about two years now. So being home has been pretty suffocating. Oh. Okay. Sorry about the pregnant thing. Thanks. See that really ripped guy right there? That's me. Basically, I fight undead creatures and monsters in the underworld. And when I defeat the enemy like that they release a Spirit Ball, like a power-up. And occasionally it can turn me into a beast. What kind of beast? Were tiger, were bear, werewolf. Or the more rare, golden werewolf. That's my favorite. Hence the title. You wanna try? Is that the game or your stomach? I'm a little hungry. Well, we are in an ice cream shack. I think I got some on my face. I got a brain freeze. Hey, its me. I hope you get this message before I get home so I don't have to hear the sound of my own voice. I just wanted to- Hi. I think that, Oh, hey. There you are. Sorry, I was out in the garden. No, no, it's good. I was just calling to let you know I'll be home a little late tonight. My boss wants input on a client he's pitching So just don't wait up for dinner I'll grab something on my way home. Okay. I love you. Enjoy the rest of your day. You too. And honey let's have sex tonight when I get home if it's not too late. Sure. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. What's your band like? Two guitars, bass and drums. I mostly sing. What about your guitar? I try to write songs too. I wish I was good at something. What do you like? I like gardening. People. I'm actually really good with people. Did you go to school? I commuted to Alfred for a while. That's where I met Michael. But I didn't finish. Why not? Michael was a few years older than me. And after he graduated, we got married and we had other plans. Maybe you'll go back. Maybe. What did you do with the shell? I found it in an antique store a couple of years after you left. It reminded me of you. You still have yours? Mm hmm. What about you, any serious relationships? None worth mentioning. Really? Nah. I moved around too much. Besides musicians are the worst, bunch of lowlifes. I'm gonna grab a soda, do you want anything? No thanks. I love you so much. Hey. I changed my mind. What happened? I don't know. You know, you can talk to me. I'm just tired. Why don't you go to bed, I'll clean up. You sure? Yeah. What's wrong? Open it. Marian's been using it as an ashtray. Well, you know, it is a tobacco tin. It's an 1877 collector's item. Why are you defending her? I don't know. I guess I'm just glad she's here. Fine, but you know, she still could respect our home and so could you cause you allow it. I'm sure it was an honest mistake. Sorry, I'm late. I know. Miles I missed this place. I didn't. The smell. Marian, this is Pablo and Suzy. Guys, this is Marian. - Hey. - Hey. Okay, go get your aprons. Yes, sir. They're a trip. I told you I'd get them back though. You did. So I strolled up to Pablo's house. I knew they'd be together, right. So they were in Pablo's car, the whole thing was filled with smoke- So does this mean I'll work less shifts? Yeah. Sorry. I've never had to do this before. Marian, I'm gonna have to let you go. What? I thought that was implied when I hired you? I cant afford to pay all three of you. You're great, but I don't have the money. So I have until like next week? Yeah. Or, no I was thinking like today. Like now. Come back anytime, you know and ice cream will always be free. Bye. Marian, I'm gonna need that apron. Right. I'm sorry. Thank you. Hey. Hey. You're leaving? Oh, yeah. I got fired. Miles can't pay me so. Oh, shit. Sorry dude. He told me when I got hired, I just forgot. Bummer. You seem cool. You wanna smoke? Yeah, I do. I don't know what to do. Today? With my life. Try not to think about that right now. Most places in the world, wolves have been pursued to the extent that they're extremely afraid of humans making it very difficult to get close enough to study them. But this region is so remote they're pretty much unfazed by humans. To learn what I wanted, I knew I had to find the den. The shelter where the wolves raise their pups for a few months out of the year, in a cave or a small burrow. In these parts there's only one such den every thousand square miles. Locking me out of my own fucking house? Get the fuck off me! Viv. Vivian! What's going on. Sorry. I thought you were somebody else. Who else would I be? I must've been daydreaming. The front door was locked. Is everything okay? I'm fine. Really. Wow. I don't think I've seen you wear that since our first date. I felt like something different today. Aren't you home early? Yeah, everyone left early today. I'm gonna go get changed. Kids will be showing up soon. Hi, this is Vivian Rivera. You stopped by my house last week. I wanted to know if you had any more information about my sister. I'm worried about her. Unfortunately Ms. Rivera, I don't have any news about Marian. But we did manage to locate her husband Robert. Where is he? Mercy Hospital in Buffalo. Apparently, he was in a terrible accident shortly before we found the car. Someone drove him to the ER. Is he still there? The doctor said he was making a speedy recovery. I imagine by now he's been discharged. Hello? Hello? I want to kiss my wife. Do you know where the phone book is? Yeah, where it always is. What are you doing? I'm calling Riley's. Why? Marian should be home by now. Hon, relax I'm sure she's on her way. You think this is too much? No one's scared even a little bit, huh? Happy Halloween. Everybody gets one. Happy Halloween. Happy Halloween scarecrow. Did you see the scarecrow took two? Oh, I have candy breath. I don't mind. It's time to refill. This is so unlike my sister. Really, seems pretty in keeping to me. What does that mean? I mean she hasn't been very reliable that's all. Viv she basically abandoned you, right? You have no idea. I'm sorry. I just don't think Marian's being totally honest with us. You know I forgot to tell you, I spoke to my friend Dave who works at a record store in Binghampton. He knows her band, The Error. He said, there's no way they played a show in Paris. They play dive bars upstate. I just know how much Marian hurt you, okay. And I don't wanna see that happen again. Marian's been through a lot. What'd she tell you? I just know that she's doing really well, all things considered. Trick or treat. Hey, Marian. Happy Halloween. Welcome home. Welcome home. We were worried about you. You're so late. Why are you wearing that? Why are you home so late? Work. I was working. Viv, Michael thinks I'm you. Its uncomfortable. Don't worry about Michael. If he tries something on you, just reject him. He's used to it. There's a horror marathon on channel 4! Besides you're only here a few more days, right? Well, we have to stop. You can't pretend to be me anymore, okay? It's dangerous. What are you talking about? Can't you just trust me? No, I can't. I had no idea where you were for six years. Why should I trust you? Let's go. Michael's waiting to watch a movie. Viv. What? Come on I feel like we've been up here forever. I'm going to bed. Okay. Rodger. Should I make dinner? I'm not hungry. Rodger! Is that you? I wanna watch this. What is it Prince? There's nothing there, now you behave. Prince quiet. Now down. Prince come back here. Open the door. No. Hey honey, have you been taking your vitamins? No. You know, we're almost out of zinc. Would you mind picking more up, please? If these things did anything we'd have a toddler by now. Yeah. Well you know they can't hurt. Hey. Marian. How are you? What's up? Want some free ice cream? Actually, can I buy some weed? Yes. I It's on me. Really? Yeah, for firing you. Thank you. By the way, someone was trying to reach you on the phone. Who? I can't remember her name. But she said that-|I got her number, I gave you her number. No, I gave you, I gave her your number and then I said she could reach your at your house. Okay. That's cool, right? Shit! Vivian? Hi, can I help you. Can I get some tissues, please? Certainly. Would you like anything else? I'll take this. Okay. - Excuse me. - Yes. Could you take a photo of me? Sure. Maybe take a couple? Hello? One sec. What's up. Did you forget something? Where's Marian? What? I'm her twin. There's two of you? Yeah. Is she here? Marian, doesn't work here anymore. Since when? Yesterday. But she stopped by earlier. But that was a few hours ago now. Did she say where she was going? No, she didn't. Your last name? Rivera R-I-V-E-R-A. And would you like matte or glossy finish? Matte. Matte, okay. Pick up will be in an hour. Would you like that? - Yeah. - $6.99. Hey there. Hey. This message is for Marian. Marian! We added a show in Hornell. We're playing 331 tonight. I put you on the list. I hope you get this in time. I've been trying to reach you. Oh, and guess who was at our show last night? Robert. He told me about the accident. He's still a little beat up. Anyway, he's coming tonight too. So see you there. I don't really have a home, I am in a band. So we travel around a lot. That sounds so exciting. You guys want another? Can I have three shots of tequila, please? Yeah, the traveling is exhausting. I'm sure. But then you wake up and you're in Paris and the exhaustion just sort of melts away. Wow! Last name. Rivera. To new friends. - Cheers. - Cheers. I'm gonna go put a song on, any requests? Whatever you want. Are you gonna put something on? There you are. What? I've been looking for you everywhere. Why aren't you at your show? Oh, I came to get a drink first. Should have known I'd find you in a divey spot like this. Can I buy you one more? What time is it? It's ten to eight. I have to go. Forget about the show. I have to pick something up. One drink. I just wanna talk to you. I think you owe me that much. What are you having? Whatever you're having. There's something different about you. I changed my hair. Two whiskey sodas. How long have you been here? A couple of weeks. I've been staying with my sister. You have a sister? I never told you about Vivian? You never talk about your family. To your hometown. Here's your change. How long have you been in town? I drove down today. You're up. Hmm. I'm dying to know what song you were about to play. I don't know this one. It's a classic. What? Nothing is just the way you look at me. I'm crazy about you. You know that. There she is. Do you wanna dance? I was in the hospital. Did you know that? Still a little painful. Sorry. You really fucked me up. Didn't even bother to see if I was alive or not. Woah easy, easy. I'm fine. I just got a little dizzy. I think I need to sit. Hey, let's go get some fresh air. Holy shit, Marian! Hey. Speak of the ghost. I love this look. You okay? What? Sasha told me you're dealing with some family stuff. Oh, yeah. Everything's fine. I'm getting a beer. You want one? No thanks. Have you seen Robert? It's pretty early, I'm sure he'll show up. I have to go. Why? We're on next. You can't leave. It's my sister. Something's wrong. Anything else you need? Yeah, can I get a pack of reds? And do you guys sell flashlights? Yeah. Where am I? You are right where you belong. There you go. Stay. Come. Be careful. Undress. What? Let's get out of here. Come on. Why? Hurry up. Wait here. Here, tie me up like you just were. Why? Just trust me Let's just get out of here. Trust me. The car is parked at the end of the block. There are keys in the coat pocket. Wait for me there. That's good! That's good! Get out of here. Hide. Wait, the light. That's enough Charles. I said that's enough. Come here. Who the fuck is that? Who the fuck is that? Marian.
