You gonna play for the high school team? Moved around for a while, so i couldn't make tryouts. That's too bad. Now, you and vic on the same team... [chuckles] that'd be something to see. I don't play dirty. I know. A word to the wise, though? Vic's used to being the top dog around here. He doesn't like to be shown up. Thanks. [Pats his back] alright. You! My office. Come on, vic! [?♪♪] Sorry i'm late, kevin. Everyone's trying to get out of the office Early for thanksgiving, And i've been in and out of meetings All morning, so-- No problem. Glad you're here. Yeah. So how's jenny? She's good, considering. When is she due? Ah, february. But the doctor says It's gonna be more like january. Twin boys. Wow. Tell me about it. So, uh, you ready? Oh, is anybody ever really ready? But i think we've been waiting For this for some time, So we'll be just fine. Let's talk over here. Yeah. We've known each other a long time, kevin. Nobody appreciates your company's work More than i do. And we appreciate your business. Well... you're always on time, you're on budget. Your designs have a unique quality We cannot find anywhere else. [Sighs] why do i feel like This is all leading to a "but"? But... [takes a breath] You are also expensive. With the economy the way it is right now-- We can't afford To renew precision design's contract for next year. Well, let's put our heads together And figure this out. And i wish i could. Dan, you're our biggest client. Without this retainer... look, i know This couldn't come at a worse time. Maybe in six or eight months, if things turn around, kevin... i'm sorry. [Wry chuckle] How could they all of a sudden Just cancel our contract? I'm sure they didn't make the decision lightly. They've been very happy with our work. Well, then i don't understand. I'm guessing, but it seems obvious-- It's the economy, cutbacks. Kevin, that's, like, over a third of our operating budget. Which is why i wanted to Talk to you about it right away. I know this is obviously something That affects all of us. What happens now? Well, first of all, let's nobody panic. We have other projects, We have more money coming in before the end of the year, And, just this morning, i put out some feelers, Trying to drum up some more business. And? Well, i know with christmas coming, This is pretty much the worst news i could be telling you, But i also want you to know I plan to do everything i can to keep this company going. [?♪♪] Get it while it's hot. Homemade vegetable soup, Perfect thing for an autumn evening. When did you learn how to make soup? Well, it's this new thing called the internet. It's amazing what you can find on there. Well, i'm very impressed. Thank you. But i'm pregnant, i'm not an invalid. Hey, doctor says you have to stay off your feet. I can still make dinner. Yeah, but i figured i need the practice Because, once the twins get here, I'll be cooking plenty. Hmm. Good point. Thank you, lord, for this meal. Thank you! [Chuckling] It's good! Hey! You hear that, boys? "It's good." She said it's good. Oh, my gosh. -Seriously? -I think they heard you. [Gasps] he kicked! But which one is it? I--I don't know. If this is mark, kick once. If it's benjamin, kick twice. [Laughing] You never told me how that meeting went. Fine. How much did they ask you To cut back on the contract? They decided not to renew our contract. They can't afford me. What? We'll be okay. Are you sure? Are you kidding? I started precision design 10 years ago, and i intend to keep it running Until our sons are old enough to support us. You should have told me. [Takes a breath, sighs] look. Well, the only thing that matters right now Is that you take care of yourself. I got this. Okay? Okay. So go back in there and put your feet up. I'll finish up in here, okay? [Laughs] okay. [Sighs heavily] [?♪♪] Sara? [?♪♪] Happy thanksgiving. Uh, we got turkey, stuffing, Cranberry sauce, sweet potato pie And green beans. You gotta be kidding. [Chuckles] wait till you see what we have for dessert. I don't like green beans. Then no dessert for you, young lady. [Laughs] I still don't understand why mom has to work today. They pay time-And-A-Half for holidays. Who eats at a diner on thanksgiving? People with nowhere else to go. People like us, you mean. We have a home. No. We had a home. Now we live here. Hey, wait-- Uh... thank you for this food, thank you for our family, And please help mom have a good day at work, And... be with dad, wherever he is. Amen. Amen. Alright, let's eat! Ooh. Gotta get some ketchup in there, huh? Hey, lynn? Would you mind locking up? It's just my family's got dinner waiting for me. Sorry. No problem. Thanks, and, um... happy thanksgiving. You, too, murph. Happy thanksgiving. [Sighing] [?♪♪] Why'd you say that before? He's not even our dad anymore. Nothing's gonna change that. It's been almost a year. He probably stopped looking for us. Do you want him to find us? Do you think he's still as bad? I don't know. Maybe. I just figured the best thing to do is pray for him. Maybe it'll help. Maybe. Alright, come on. Jump shot. Let's see if you can do it. Go for it. Ready? Alright, make sure you take your follow-Through right through-- -...Like that. -Okay. -Okay. -Alright, go for it. There you go! Nice one. Nice work. Nice work. High-Five. [?♪♪] Here. Take this just in case you change your mind. [?♪♪] Take my card, In case you change your mind. Alright, happy holidays. Thank you. Very much. [?♪♪] [?♪♪] [Laughing] Pastor cody! Wow, i don't believe it! Wow. It's been a while. How've you been? Ah, you know. The usual. We really miss you at the center. Yeah! No, i, uh, i miss it, too. It's just been crazy. Yeah, jenny's almost due? Few more weeks, yeah. Twice blessed, amen. Yeah. Listen, i've gotta run. It's great seeing you, kevin. Give my best to jenny. -I will do. -Alright. Hey! Man, i'm serious about missing you down at the center. Why don't you drop by some time? Show the guys some of those old-School moves of yours? I'll try. God bless you, kevin. Merry christmas. You too. [?♪♪] Ah. Thank you. How are we looking? Fine. You always say that. We are. We're fine. We'll be okay. You always say that, too. Alright, wise guy, What am i gonna say next? Well, let's see. Next, maybe you'll say... "i'm gonna open up a little bit, jenny. "Talk about how worried i am, And stop trying to carry the whole load by myself." You're already carrying more than your share. I don't want to stress you out even more. I worry more when you don't talk. [Sighs heavily] I'm working on a some ideas, But everywhere i call, They say "wait till after the holidays, Then we'll see." Ugh. That sounds so frustrating. Yeah. [Sighs] There was one bright spot in my day. I ran into pastor cody. From the community center? Yeah, he wants me To come and play ball with the boys. Oh, you used to have so much fun When you volunteered over there. Like i've got time for that now. Well, you could make time. You could use a little more fun. [She chuckles] Sara? Come on, honey! [Sara]: the pipes are making that weird noise again! I'll fix it later. We're gonna be late. Mom, i gotta get something for lunch. I made you a sandwich. Ah. Thanks. Hey, tommy, i want you to do something for me. I want you to make out a christmas list. Yeah, right. I'm serious. I want you to make me a list of what you want. Mom, we can barely keep food in the house, Your car's on life-Support. How are you gonna buy christmas presents? I signed you and sara up for the "angel tree" program. The what? The salvation army does a thing Where kids make out a christmas list, And then people pick their names and buy the gifts. I guess that makes it official. We are now a charity case. Thomas. No, i get it, mom. We're broke! But did you have to advertise it to the whole world? I just wanted something under the tree for you and sara. [Scoffs] what tree? There's not gonna be any tree. -Dad made sure of that! -This isn't about your father. It should be! It's his fault we're stuck in this dump. Why isn't he doing anything? Why isn't he helping us? Thomas, it was my decision to leave. If you want to blame anyone... blame me. That's not what i mean. I know, honey. And i know this is hard, but... it's not gonna be forever. Okay? Let's just try to have a nice christmas, And be grateful for all the things that we do have. Now, if you won't do it for me, Please do it for sara. Anything i want? Within reason. So a 60-Inch flat-Screen tv is out? [Chuckles] Thank you. I love you. You too. Alright, sara, let's go! Coming. [?♪♪] [Hushed indistinct chatter] [Vic snickers] Thanks, mom. See you later. Oh, hey! -Your list. -Not yet. I gotta go. Oh, no, no. No, they have a deadline. I need to get it in. -Okay. I'll do it today. -Okay! -Have a good day! -You too. Bye, thomas. -See you, sara. -Bye. [Engine choking up] [Engine sputters and threatens to fail] Uh-Oh. -Mom? Oh... no-No-No-No-No. Not right now. Mom, we're not gonna be late, right? No, we're gonna be fine. We're not gonna be late. [Engine falters and dies] [Guys snickering] [Lynn]: no, no, honey, we're not gonna be late. Smooth ride, slick. Come on, come on, come on. Come on. Start up, start up. Honey, i don't know what's wrong with it. It's a piece of junk. Like i planned this, thomas, Just to ruin your life. Put it in neutral. I'll push. Take the brake off! Okay, i did! [Girl grunts] Um, hi. -Don't stop! -Oh! [Chuckles] [Engine chugs to life] [Lynn]: thanks, honey! Uh, thanks. Any time. Uh, wait! What's your--? [Chuckles smugly] Hey! Graham! Decided to take you up on your offer. I'm glad you did. Yeah, just felt a little drama here. Anything i should know about? Yeah, it's called getting challenged by the new kid. Really gets the testosterone pumping around here. Man! Mm. Kid's got talent. You ready? -Yeah! Let's give it a shot. -Go get 'em! -I'll leave this with you. -Alright. Let's see what you got! [?♪♪] Follow through. Let me show you. Put your weight here, make sure it's even, Follow through with the shot. Give it a shot. [Snickers] [?♪♪] Boys, you can do this. [Groaning] What was i thinking? [Chuckles] here you go. [Grateful groan] oh... thank you. Oh! Oh, my goodness. Do you realize That, by the time our sons are that age, I will be... ugh, oldish. You're gonna be a great father. If i can keep up. Oh, well, take your tylenol, grandpa. And warm up next time. Oh... do you really think I'm gonna be a great father? A great father. It's not automatic, though. I was looking at some of those guys today, And i kept wondering-- How did they get so angry? I mean, they didn't start that way. How do you even know if you're doing the right thing? Our sons are gonna have a safe home, A strong faith, And they're gonna have something that nobody else has-- They're gonna have us. [Jenny]: aw, there they are. Our boys, benjamin and mark. [Kevin]: look at the hands. Look at them. [Jenny]: they look like you. [Kevin laughs] yeah, yeah. [Jenny]: they're our boys. I don't understand. We talked about how, sometimes with twins, One of the babies can be a late-Bloomer. Just doesn't grow as fast as his sibling. Last time you said that was normal. And we'd hoped That the weight discrepancy between "baby a" and "baby b" Would correct itself with time, but... he's just not growing. Benjamin. What does that mean? Well, on one hand, There is a very good chance That both babies are normal and healthy, And this little guy's just smaller. Or? Or... with this kind of discrepancy, We're concerned that it could be something more serious. It's still not too late To change your minds about having an amniocentesis. Oh, no. We decided not to. We've waited this long. I understand, But it could give you some peace of mind. Is there anything else we can do about it? To help? You're already doing everything humanly possible. We'll have you come in Every week now so we can monitor both babies. And in the meantime, Just keep taking care of yourself. Get plenty of rest. We'll see you through this. Thank you. -Okay? -Okay. [Vic continues clapping] Don't get any big ideas, slick. What're you talking about? Cassie. She's way out of your league. She was just helping me out. 'Cause she feels sorry for you. Just like everyone else at this school. I gotta get to class. Sure. I just... didn't want you getting your hopes up about cassie. See, she's always been a real sucker When it comes To lost dogs, baby birds... and charity cases. [School bell rings] Ahh! Uh, sorry. Nah, it's okay. Court's open. Where's that other guy? Pastor graham? He had to run out. He asked me to lock up. We still got another half-Hour. -You a pastor here, too? -No. Graham ran some camps last summer, So i-- I helped out. Now i'm just messing around, But back in school, I used to play ball to help me clear my head, Help me think, you know? Figured i'd give it-- -...Another shot. -Think about what? There's always something. Yeah. I come out here so i don't have to think. Just makes things worse. Well, not thinking about your problems Doesn't make 'em go away. So... what do you do? I wish i knew. Maybe we just gotta try our best, And have faith things will turn out The way they're meant to. I know one thing. What? We're not leaving here until you miss. Might be here a while. Here you go. Uh, here. What's this? My list. On one condition. You can't read it. -Thomas! -It's nothing crazy. Well, then why can't i read it? Just... okay? Please? Okay. But if someone shows up at our door with a jet-Ski... then you'd better give him milk and cookies, Because it's gonna be santa.

All these people... and there's still weeks to go. Speaking of which, What do you want for christmas? Kevin... yeah? It's a giant angel tree. Yeah, the salvation army runs the program, And the kids make a list Of what they want for christmas. And people pick the names and buy whatever they ask for. Yeah, i've heard about this! It's a great idea. Let's do it. What? Let's pick two names off the tree, And buy them whatever they ask for. Uh, jenny, i don't think we can really afford to. Okay. You just asked me what i want for christmas. This is it, This is my gift from you, To make two children very happy on christmas morning. You're serious? It'll be good practice.

What? Be sure to tell your buddy, vic, about the funny look On my face when you showed me. I'm sure you two will get a good laugh out of that. What are you talking about? [Class bell ringing] [?♪♪] "Tom brandt is a new kid at school. "As you can see by these pictures, "He is in dire need of food, clothing, "And a life. "If we get 1,000 followers to this page, "We will buy tom a whole new wardrobe, And maybe lunch." He's not my buddy. I told you, he's a jerk, Just another insecure jock That makes himself feel important By bullying other people around. Fine. Whatever. And just so we're clear, I didn't have anything to do With putting that facebook page up either. I hate the way those guys were laughing at you. And just so we're clear? I'm not some little lost dog. I don't need anybody to feel sorry for me. What? So go find another good cause and leave me alone. That's all i want, For everybody to just leave me alone. The only i only told you about what vic was doing Is because i wanted you to know That not everyone in this school is like him. Some of us care about each other. But that's okay, Because you just want to be left alone. So, hey, no problem. But next time you think Someone's feeling sorry for you, Take a good look in the mirror. [Phone rings] Jenny, hey, hi. Everything alright? [Laughs] you do realize that every time i call now, It sounds like you're at the starting line Of a 100-Yard dash? What? No, come on. I was just, uh... really? It's a bad sign, When your wife, who's expecting twins, Has to remind you to breathe. Ah, point taken. But i'm fine, thank you for asking. I just wanted to tell you That i did all my shopping for stephanie. -Who? -Stephanie. The little girl i picked, from the angel tree. Right, from the mall. Don't tell me you forgot. No! No, i, uh... i have it-- I have it right here. Paper angel. Yeah. Kevin, you can't leave this to the last minute Like you always do. The salvation army needs the presents in Plenty of time before christmas. Absolutely. Besides, this might be a good way To get your mind off things. Yeah. I love you. I love you, too. [?♪♪] Excuse me? Hi. Can i get this in a 10 and a half? And you can just put it on this card? Kevin? -Amanda! Hi! -My gosh, i don't believe it. Wow! It's so great to see you. I thought you were in nashville. Visiting the folks for christmas. Shopping. That's great! How's the new job? Oh, my gosh, i love it. And the agency's really starting to take off. Well, i'm sure you had a lot to do with that. If i have, it's because i learned from the best. Yeah, we were a pretty good team. Maybe we can be again. Tell me more. Come here. I was gonna call you. It's not official, But we may have a client here in town Signing with the agency. I told everyone in nashville about you, And, well, they wanna hear your pitch on the account. Seriously? Seriously. Still some hoops to jump through, But with my recommendation... call me right after the holidays. It's great to see you again, kevin. It's great to see you. Merry christmas. You too. Merry christmas. [?♪♪] Hey! You'll never guess who i ran into. -Who? -Amanda! When was the last time you saw her? I don't know, like couple of years? It came with a bolt out of the blue. She wants you to call? Yeah, after the holidays. I mean, the clock's still ticking. Maybe this is like an early christmas present. Yeah. Maybe it is. Hey, dinner's on. Thanks. [Kevin chuckles] let me help you up. [?♪♪] You're such a gentleman. Oh, yeah. That's me. [?♪♪] There he is. [Laughing] [?♪♪] [?♪♪] [?♪♪] [?♪♪] Make me an offer? Oh! No, i was just... i designed this, way back when. You don't say? My first big contract. At least it seemed pretty big at the time. They liked it. They had it everywhere. [Chuckles] i remember. I'll never forget the first time i walked into a store, And saw this. Took everything i had to keep from doing cartwheels Down the middle of the aisle. Well, you should've. -Think so? -How often in life-- ...do we honestly appreciate a moment? Pure and simple? Under the circumstances, A cartwheel sounds like just the thing. Probably right. You still in the business? Yeah, though i don't feel very much Like doing cartwheels these days. Yeah. Just when you think you got it all figured out, Life comes along, throws you a curve. Ah, just because you get the message Doesn't mean you should give up. What do you mean? What? What message? Young fella, I worked my tail off for 40 years Trying to get where i thought i wanted to be... big house, summer home, Season tickets to the titans. One day, i went home... kids were grown, My wife was a stranger, And that big house just seemed empty. My life was like an old puzzle, With the pieces scattered all around. I didn't know how to put it back together. Not by myself. What'd you do? I got the message. And here we are. -Hi, honey. -Hi. Mwah! I'll see you at home. Okay. Oh, don't forget, Frank and janet are bringing the kids Over for dinner, And then we're having rachel's recital. Yes, ma'am. I'll be there. Nancy? Love you. I love you, too. You didn't come here to listen to me. What can i do for you? Actually, i'm here to get a basketball jersey. Alright. Which player? Ah! The "paper angel" tree. Oh, you've heard of it? [Chuckles] here. Let's have a look. Alright, yeah! Right over here. [?♪♪] [?♪♪] I mean, i'm no expert, But isn't that what they call cyber-Bullying? I don't know. Maybe. Try it again. But shouldn't you be talking to somebody about it? Like a... maybe a teacher? What are they gonna do about it? The moment they ask, Vic will delete the page, And i'll look like a bigger loser. Okay. What does your family have to say about it? Whoa. Alright. What do your friends say? You're talking about high school, remember? Nobody wants to hang out with the new kid, Especially when some jock puts a target on his back. You're gonna tell me that, in that entire high school, No one's reached out to you? A kid as sharp as you? [Scoffs] maybe i'm not as sharp as you think. No. Maybe you need to-- To reach out to them. Let 'em know that there's more to you Than just being the new kid. How am i supposed to do that? Did you ever think that maybe... there's something guiding us In everything we do? And i mean, when... when things go wrong-- And i mean really, really wrong-- There's still a way to get through it. You just have to trust that feeling, That guidance from inside. Yeah. [?♪♪] Hey, mom? Mm-Hmm? When can we get our christmas tree? Um, i'm not sure, hon. My friends already have theirs. They've got lights outside and everything, Like dad used to put up sometimes. Yeah, i remember. We have to get new ornaments and decorations, too. We left all of ours at home. Or we could go back to get them. Sara, you know that-- We wouldn't have to stay or anything! We could just get the ones tommy and i made for you To hang on the tree. And maybe... maybe dad's better now. Maybe everything would be okay. Honey... i miss him sometimes, too. But we can't go back. What if he forgets me? Oh... come here. Now, listen, listen. Your father could never, ever forget you. And every day i pray that he will get better, So he can come show you himself How much you mean to him. But no matter what, I'm gonna make sure that everything is good For me and you and thomas. I promise. [Sara]: and we can get a christmas tree? [Lynn laughs]: and we can get a christmas tree. [?♪♪] [Murph]: what kind of job you looking for? I'll do anything-- Wash the dishes, mop the floor, Clean the parking lot. I do all that. But my mom says you're always so busy, So i thought maybe you can use some help. Yeah, i don't know. Every time i hire a high school kid, He ends up flaking out on me, Whether it's a football practice, or a big date. I wouldn't do that! That's what they all say. I'm not gonna be in school. What? I'm dropping out. To work. Does your mother know? Well, she does now! Quit school? I was gonna tell you. Thomas! Not for good, just for a while, Just until we get back on our feet.

I can see what's going on around here. Tommy... everything is under control. I promise. Just like you promised sara we can buy our christmas tree? Is that what's going on here? No. It's just... i wanna do something. It's like... it's like something's guiding me, Something inside, and i want to trust that, And do what feels right.

So, just ignore the camera, Pretend like it's just you and i talking. Talking about what? Well, i'd like to interview you, Hear more about your salvation army project. Oh, it's not really a "project." I just wanted to try to help some people. Well, i think that's something That our viewers would love to hear about. -Really? -We're on in 30. Okay. You haven't been to the office in two days. Is that a good idea right now? Everything's under control. Then why all the frantic texting, And whispered phone calls that you think i can't hear? Aren't you supposed to be resting? You're going to lose the business, aren't you? [Sighs] I'm so sorry. Me too. We have a lot more important things To think about right now. Why don't you try and get some rest? Okay. Hey, that's the kid from at the center I told you about. -[Turns volume on] -I just started here. I didn't really know anybody, But somebody told me, they said, There were a lot of nice people at the school, And if i just gave them a chance. [Jill]: well, isn't it true that this whole thing started Because you were a victim of cyberbullying From another student? It doesn't matter how it started, As long as things turned out okay. And you've made sure of that! You've raised hundreds of donations. It wasn't me, though. [Jill]: what do you mean? The way i see it, There's... something guiding everything we do, And even when things go wrong-- And i mean, really wrong-- We just gotta trust that guidance. Like a hand, showing us the way. Sounds like a great kid. He is. ...to the salvation army? I heard about their "angel tree" program. It's all about people helping each other, Without expecting anything back. Oh, no! What is it? Paper angel! I forgot to deliver the presents! -Kevin! -Well, i was on my way. But then i found out you were here, And i rushed over. Tomorrow's christmas eve! I know! You have to take them over there. Ah, it's pretty late. Well, it's almost christmas. With all the gifts they have to give out, I'm sure somebody's working tonight. I don't want to leave you. I'm in a hospital, i'm fine. And that boy... he put all his faith in his angel. We can't disappoint him... not on christmas. I'll be right back. Oh, this is gonna be such a cool story to tell our sons. [Laughs] go! Go, go! Kevin. Doc, i just need to take care of-- -...Something real-- -It'll have to wait. What? What's going on? We'd hoped that admitting jenny would help improve The discrepancy between the two babies, But your son is starting to show signs of additional stress. What does that mean? The best choice-- Our best hope for your son is to induce labor. But jenny's not due for another month. These things don't always go according to plan. Come on. [Lynn]: yeah, it's thomas. Mrs. Brandt? -Yes. -Hi. I'm captain chambers. I'm sorry, But we only have the bag here for your daughter. Oh, there must be some mistake. My-- My son put an angel on the tree. Thomas brandt. Could you please check again? We checked. There's nothing here for your son. I don't understand. How can that be? Well, unfortunately, sometimes, a name doesn't get chosen. But we do have gifts here for our forgotten angels, You're welcome to pick one of those. "Forgotten"? How... how am i gonna tell my son That he's "forgotten"? After everything he's been through?
