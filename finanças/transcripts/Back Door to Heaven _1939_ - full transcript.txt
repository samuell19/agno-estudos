[instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [male #1] 'Don't be criticizing me, not after what you've been.' [female #1] 'It ain't what a person's been. It's what they are.' 'You used to be a soldier once' but what've you been ever since?' 'Nothing but a souse.' [male #1] 'That ain't nothing to what you are.' [female #1] 'Shut your mouth.' 'Don't you be throwing that in my face.' [male #1] 'Get on over with that stew, will you?' 'You're not even a good cook.' You like it, Frankie? Where'd it come from, mom? I got it for you at Victor Brothers. It almost fits. - But why, mom? - Graduation. Oh, gee, thanks. The old man's sauced again? Worse than ever. I get so worried sometimes I don't know how I stand it. - Supper's on. - I ain't blind. Shall we get down and eat, pa? Why.. Where did you get that hat? Mom bought it for me. It's for graduation. Yeah, that's why he got it. I bought it for him. He's don't have to graduate in not hat. We can't spare the money. Seems like we have money for liquor. It's alright, it's alright! I'll take it back, right away, I will. Yeah. You alright, mom? Yeah. I'm alright. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] - Okay, goodnight. - Goodnight. Now, Frankie, I'm not gonna let you go until you promise me that you'll do something tomorrow afternoon. Well, after all you don't graduate everyday of your life you know, it's an event. You'll do alright, Ms. Williams. Without me. Besides I can't do anything like those others. Well, I don't care if you just stand up when I call on you. The important thing is that you must take your place with them. You're going to have to do it later with a great many other people. Goodnight, Ms. Williams. Such a lovely time. Goodnight, Carol. Can you make Frankie promise not to disappoint me? - Alright. - Goodnight. Goodnight, Ms. Williams. She's fine. Which way are you going, Carol? - Come on. - Not till you promise. Look here, I'm not going to promise you or anybody else anything. Especially, when I can't do anything. You're not mad at me? Of course, not. You like me? Will you stop? But I like you, Frankie. I gotta go home. Goodnight, Frankie. Goodnight. [dramatic music] # My country 'tis of thee # # Sweet land of liberty # # Of thee I sing # # Land where my fathers died # # Land of the pilgrims' pride # # From every mountainside # # Let freedom ring ## Today, we are honored in having with us the president of our board of education. Mr. President. [all applauding] Ladies and gentlemen children If I may obtrude... ...the experience and observations 'of some years' 'which I choose to call...' ...packing ones trunk... ...for the journey. Packing ones trunk.. ...for the journey. What's he talkin' about? 'If, into ones trunk..' ...one will put enough self-discipline 'strength of character' 'respect for law and order' 'then I assure you' that each one of you shall find life a glorious and a happy adventure. [all applauding] Now, first according to the plan we settled on last night I should like to call upon John Shelly. Uh, it is John's plan to enter high school and subsequently to study law. What're you going to recite for us, John? Portia's courtroom speech from "The Merchant of Venice." "The quality of mercy is not strained. "It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven. "And earthly power "doth then show, likest God's when mercy seasons justice." [all applaud] And now, um, Wallace Kischler. 'Determined to take his place in the world of art.' [male #2] 'Well, isn't that fine?' Looks like we might go... right into the ones denied service doesn't it? [all applaud] And now, oh, Robert Hale. 'Robert, after only brief study has shown great promise' 'in his chosen field.' 'Music.' [violin music] [music continues] [all applaud] And now, Charles Smith. 'Charles has a definite flair for mathematics.' And, he is I believe, going to, uh, use some questions. How much is 11 times 12, John? A hundred and thirty two. Carol, how much is 11 times 14? A hundred and fifty four. How much is 11 times 18, Frankie? A hundred and ninety eight. Don't you see, it's this way. It's just like my papa told me. When you work in the bank, you have to be quick at figures. I work in a bank every Saturday. Someday, I'm gonna run it. When you multiply by 11 you add the two outside figures and stick 'em in the middle. [all applaud] Uh, now we're going to hear from one of our girls. 'You know in this modern world, girls have careers too.' Carol Evans. # Nita # # Juanita # # Let me linger by thy side # # Nita # # Juanita # # Be my own fair bride ## [all applaud] And now, Frankie Rogers. 'Have you thought of something to do, Frankie?' [whispering] [chuckles] [harmonica music] [all applaud] And now, a brief recess after which there will be refreshments. And you will receive your report cards 'and your certificates of graduation' 'from Grammar School.' Frankie. - Well, Sheriff Kramer. - Hiya, Mr. Hersey. You should've been here sooner. Excellent entertainment. Excellent. Glad you've seen me, sheriff. Aww. I do wish you had seen the children. Frankie was fine today. You should have heard him play his harmonica. I didn't know you play the harmonica, Frankie. Do you? A little. Well, why don't you take a seat? No, thank you, Ms. Williams. Well after school, would you mind dropping into my office? - I'd be glad to. - And bring Frankie, will you? Well, yes, of course. Thank you, Ms. Williams. Where were you last night, Frankie? I was home. That's where I was. I was home, I was. What time did you get home? After I left Ms. Williams' house. - I was home all night. - Hmm, I see. Frankie, I talked to your mother and she said you didn't get home until 10 o'clock. What about that? Well, I waited a little while, that's all. Sure you didn't wait around Clair's hardware store? Sure, you didn't break in and steal that harmonica? Did you, Frankie? I'm your friend. You can talk to me. Yes, I did. Why? Well, they wanted me to do something at school today and that's about all I could do. I didn't have the money to buy one and I saw that in the window on my way home, so I took it. What else did you take? You took some money out of the cash drawer, didn't you? - Yes. - How much? Seven dollars and eighty cents. I'm glad you weren't in court today, Ms. Williams. You hear them lads talk, you'd think Frankie had committed murder or something. Every kid steals somethin'. Whether it's a watermelon or cherries on the trees, next door. 'He has to steal somethin', before he knows it's wrong.' 'I'm sorry about the whole thing.' Couldn't you do anything about it, sheriff? No. I suppose you might say Frankie's gonna have to pay for.. Well, you know. Whoever is on the other side of the tracks. 'Besides, he's been in trouble before. On probation.' And nothing can be done about it. I got to be goin' now. It's not far from 8:15. May I go to the station to see Frankie? - Of course. - Where is he now? I sent him home to see his mother but he'll be there alright. That's what I think of the boy. Thanks for giving me the old man's suitcase, mom. I wanted to say goodbye to him but, well, he was asleep. Will you tell him, mom? Goodbye, Frankie. Gee, I never noticed how pretty these flowers looked before. Well, except that rose bush over there. Kinda skinny ain't it, mom? Do something about that, will you, mom? So long. [keyboard clacking] Where are you going, Frankie? I don't know. Say, now there's a job for me. All I gotta do is make a lot of dots and dashes. - Do you understand it? - No. Well, A is a dot and a dash. B is a dash and three dots. And C is.. Gee, I don't remember what C is. It's a cinch if you learn how to make them dots and dashes. You shouldn't have come down here. [instrumental music] Be a good boy, Frankie. I'll write to you. And we'll be waiting to see you back here. This is where you belong. [Frankie] Oh, gee, thanks, Ms. Williams. But what're you gloomy about? Do you know I've never been on a train before? Every night when I hear them chugging, whistling go around the bend down there on the Smith's grove. I always wanted to be on one, going someplace. And now, I am going someplace, ain't I, sheriff? And there'll be red, plush cushions and everything. Won't there, sheriff? Yeah, Frankie, plush cushions in there. [train hooting] Goodbye, Ms. Williams. I haven't any tickets, sheriff. Have you got them? Yes, I got your ticket, Frankie. Will you stop crying, Carol? I'll be back soon before you know it. I'm not goin' any place. Just to a farm. I like to work on a farm. Someday, I'll come back and you can't tell. Maybe someday I'll have a job like that guy in there. A cinch that all it is. Just a lot of dots and dashes. You'll get along alright in here that's if you want to, that's up to you. It's up to me to enforce the rules, I do. You understand don't you, sheriff? Yes, I understand. You understand, don't you, Frankie? Yes, sir. Alright, sheriff. Is there anything I can do for you back there, Frankie? No, I don't think so, sheriff. Gee, this is a swell place, ain't it? You a new guy? Yeah. Where are you from? I said where are you from? That's none of your business. Oh. A wise guy, huh? That's my business. That's my business. [people gasping] [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] Oh, why don't you quit? I'm alright. You look better in a hospital cot. Thanks, it went swell. What's your name? Rogers, kid. Frankie Rogers. It don't make no difference in this joint. Listen, you're no better than any of the rest of 'em prisoners but I put you in charge was to keep order up there. [thumping on roof] Listen to them bums walking around? - They're scrubbing. - Alright, see that they scrub. And see that they scrub in their bare feet. From now on, no one puts their shoes until noon. How do you think I'm gonna sleep? - That'll be trouble. - Yeah. Who's gonna make it? Anyone tries it, you beat 'em within an inch of their life. You're big enough. Alright. Alright, you mugs. Get your shoes off. Get 'em off. And from now on, keep 'em off till after 12 o'clock. You get it? And you? Come on, snap the door. Come on, come on, come on. Alright, you guys. Get 'em off. Get your shoes off. Now wake up. 'Get them shoes off from there.' Come on, stupid, wake up. Get 'em off. 'Come on, get 'em off, won't you?' Who threw that shoe? - Was it you? - No. Just in case it was. [grunting] [harmonica music] Well, I don't think we'll have to worry much longer about you, Rogers. [sighs] - No one? - No. You can't steal automobiles and start riots and get away with it. 'You're a cinch to go up for five years.' We'll know where to send your mail, alright. State Penitentiary. I hate to think how much I'm gonna miss you. [music continues] And therefore, I sentence you, Frank Rogers to the State Penitentiary for five years. [instrumental music] [crowd cheering] We're a cinch. I ain't so sure. When Frankie pitches, why not? He's a loser. Ah, what do you mean? He's got a fireball. He'd be throwing fast tomorrow all afternoon. [crowd cheering] - Safe. - Oh, no. Did you see that guy steal second? I didn't see nothing. I ain't no stool, I ain't. What do you wanna steal things for? That's how I got in here. [crowd cheering] - Alright, Frankie. That's all. - Why are you taking me out for? 'Cause I'm gave him three hits in five innings? You don't think I'm as dumb as that. You're swell. Go wash-up in the office. Oh. Yeah, don't give them any fat ones or they'll start crowding the play. Throw right for the head. Good luck, Slim. That's right, Warden. I've pitched five dinners, and I've done.. ...five years, so what? I have little respect for them who gets a chance and doesn't know how to handle it. 'This is your chance now.' 'Don't blow it.' Don't worry, Warden. I won't. - Did you get you assignment? - Yeah. With or without music? Without. Well, we're leaving here tomorrow. We'll be long gone. Three weeks in Cleveland and we'll have a roll. I'm gonna miss this joint. See you later. I'll go down and try on my suit. We've got eyes all picked out. And you always wanted to fit in it better. Yeah, since three well-dressed men leaving stark. That's not what's going out. Just three suits of old clothes. [instrumental music] Well... here it is. - Here what is? - Outside. - Look at it. - At what? What do you like to do? I want a steak. I'd like to see some gal. What would you like, Frankie? I just wanna get rid of this bundle.. Some color buttons, old shirt.. ...blazer. And five years. [intense music] [organ music] [organ music] [male #3] 'Gentlemen, I shall speak to you tonight' 'of success.' 'I have no patience with people' who quarrel with their lot in life. I tell you, I have no patience with people who quarrel with their lot in life 'because success..' 'Success, after all' 'rests within yourself.' Swell steak, ain't it? Yeah. It's got meat all around it. [male #3] 'Take me for example.' 'When I was a little boy' 'I began by singing in the choir.' 'And when the contribution box was passed' 'I gave' 'I tell you, I gave!' 'I gave even of my pennies.' What are we gonna do with the dishes? Say, if I had a gun and you'd throw em' up in the air I could knock em' off like clay pigeons. Well, you haven't got any and you ain't gonna have one. Well, I'm not gonna wash 'em. Nobody asked you to. - Say, I got an idea. - Hm? There's a joint down here I used to sing in. I'd like to make him a present. They don't care if they're washed or not. Anyway, I'd like a drink. Yeah, so do I. Okay, Frankie? Anything. I just gotta keep moving. [instrumental music] [music continues] Ladies and gentlemen! I wanna introduce to you tonight a fine little artist who appeared here many years ago! He's been a guest star for the last few years. What I mean to say is he's been a guest to the government but you wouldn't understand about that. Now I'm gonna ask him to sing one of the old songs that he used to sing for me before he asked for a raise in pay. Ladies and gentlemen I take great pride in introducing that marvelous singer of old songs accompanied by the Silver Slipper singing waiters and I want you to give him a great, big hand Mr. Bert Gatto! Come on. [instrumental music] # I can see a bunch of country folks # # Sitting around a local store all swapping jokes # # In my hometown # # Why did I ever ever roam? # # I must be crazy # # Though the city gals are not so slow # # Take me to those country gals I used to know # # For since I roamed away # # I'm lonesome # # Night and day # # Hometown ## Hometown # # Want to wander around your back streets # # See those tumbledown old shack streets # # I'd love to walk in on those # # Cozy country cousins of mine # # Hometown where the doves are softly cooin' # # Where there's always nothin' doin' # # I'd get a welcome from those # # Cozy country cousins of mine # # There's an old schoolhouse door # # We used to tumble through at four # # And that same candy store # # Where I could eat a dozen lollipops # # And ask for more # # Gee # # What I'd give the world to see # # That old gang of mine # # Mm mm # # Say I can hear 'em just as plain # # Standing on the street corner # # Their heads bunched together # # Harmonizing # # Adeline # # Sweet Adeline # # Sweet Adeline # # Where the garden trees are shady # # Where the lady waltzes.. # # I'm going back # # To that shack # # To those country cousins of mine ## [crowd applauding] What a night. What a night. What a night! Well, I got enough dough to get us out of these clothes. A steak of sermon and dames. - Swell, wasn't it, Frankie? - Yeah. - Steak was okay. - Well, what do we do next? I'm going home. You guys wanna come along, it's okay. If you don't, it's okay, too. Well, what do we get in a town like that? Just a lot of fresh air.. ...if you think you can stand it. Good morning, Ms. Williams. Oh! Uh, good morning, Albert. Lots of mail this morning. What's the idea? Ain't the first of the month, is it? Well, thank you. Oh, that is a lot, isn't it? Yeah, but that ain't all. Will you hold that for me a minute, please? Oh, I am a bother this morning. You must be all worn out. You know, I'm just, I've been doing it for 30 years I'll be re-retiring soon. And on a pension, too. Then I can go fishing whenever I like and no more work, just fishing. Why, Albert, this town wouldn't be the same without you bringing the mail around every day. I don't believe you'd be happy if you couldn't. I don't know what I'd do if they stopped me from teaching at school. Well, how the way you look at it, I suppose. But I'm getting old. Well, so am I. You know why I got so much mail today? It's my birthday. Well, I'll be darned. I hope it's alright. - Happy birthday, sweetie. - Oh! Albert! [mumbling] Albert, come on! [Williams laughing] And to think so many of your friends remembered you! - Why not? That's what I'd say. - Oh! [laughs] I didn't mean that. But it is lovely, don't you think? Oh, they've all been so sweet. Now, isn't this one nice? That's from John Shelley. Remember Henry Shelley's son? - Why, yes. - Of course. Jeez, I do. Oh, he's done so well, I hear but then, of course, I knew he would. Well, I think his folks were right smart to make him a lawyer. - I do, too. - Yes. [female #2] With the world being like what it is today. [Williams] Well, I do hope John is happy. Oh, and Robert Hale and his music. Remember how he used to play the violin? He had a fine talent, I thought. I do hope he's doing well. This one's from "Wallace Kischler." He says he painted that himself. It's all in watercolors. Sorta shows his early promise. Yes, I suppose Wallace is a big artist now. My niece had a cousin who was a painter, too. But the last time she wrote me she told me that he was strictly on the bottle! Now, what do you suppose she meant by that? A man doesn't paint bottles all the time, does he? [telephone ringing] Hello? Oh, hello, Charley. I just wanted to wish you many happy returns, Ms. Williams. Yes, I'm sorry, I couldn't get over to see you but you know, I just can't help being sentimental when it comes to birthdays especially, concerning my teacher. Oh, well, it was awfully nice of you to remember. Goodbye. Oh. That was Charley Smith. He's only one of that class I believe, who's still in town. Well, I don't blame him, being in charge of his father's bank and all. "Carol Evans." - Carol Evans. Who is she? - Don't you remember? Well, she used to live next door to the Neelis on Elm Street. I believe she's a big actress now. [instrumental music] # Birds have their nest # # Stars have their sky # # I'm just a wanderer # # No friend have I # # I need a friend # # A wonderful friend # # To hold my hand # # And understand # # I need someone # # When the long day is done # # To share with me # # A setting sun # # Everyone else in this wide wide world # # Has someone who cares # # Nobody else in this wide wide world # # Men choose me in their.. # # If you are my friend # # My whole life I'd spend # # In your embrace # # Any old place # # I need # # A friend ## Well, I don't think we need to worry about Carol. She'll turn out alright. Well, I think these have made me happier than any of the others. They're from Frankie Rogers. Well.. He certainly didn't come to a good end. Well, I don't think Frankie was really a bad boy. He just didn't have the same chance the others had. He made those bookends himself, he says. According to this card, he isn't in the reformatory. He's travelling. Well, I do hope Frankie's alright 'cause sometimes I worry about him as much as though he were my own son. I used to live in a little town once myself. Yeah? Why did you leave? Well, it was like this. I stole a horse and took it home. It was a white horse and I started to paint it black. Well, I just got one side of it done and then I'd run out of paint. I've often thought that a little more paint would have changed my whole career. But that's the way it goes. [train blowing horn] Right, Frankie? Yeah, that's the way it goes. [instrumental music] Where'd you pick up this rod? In an honky-tonk. I had to take something and there was no toothbrushes around. And make sure you guys are in front of the the First National Bank at 2:30. 2:30 in the morning? No, 2:30 in the afternoon. [instrumental music] I know the old man died.. ...but, but.. ...what about my mother? Ain't nothing more to tell you, Mr. Frankie except that she's just touched in the head, that's all. 'And they taken her away to..' ...to-to Toledo, somebody said. Ain't Toledo the place where they care crazy people? Yes. That's the place. [female #2] 'Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Frankie, but... ' Did you see my mother when she left? What did she say? What did she do? I didn't see her, I didn't but they say she just wasn't sad at all. 'Only one thing funny she did was just before she left.' 'When she stood out there at the gate' 'she said that the Germans were comin' to fetch her.' She said.. "What pretty roses, ain't it?" Then they knew she was touched 'cause there wasn't a single rose nowhere. Anything else? Then she said "Please take care of that scrawny one over there 'cause that's the one Frankie liked." 'Then they took her away. That's all.' You've been here long? About a year. Oh, yeah. Even I can fix you up for the night, there's a room upstairs. 'Suppose you'd want to stay once more in your home' 'after being away so long.' No, thanks, Mrs. Hamilton. How much, how many children you got in this family? Oh, just these two. Oh, yeah, another one, Roy. Oh, I guess you don't remember him, though. He's a man now. He's a porter on the B&O. It's fine. Ms. Williams, is she still a.. Still in town? Ms. Williams, she here, she here all the time. Gotten old now, but still just as pretty 'Still lives at the same place over on Spruce Street.' Thanks, Mrs. Hamilton. Are you gonna be a porter, too, when you grow up? Maybe. I don't know, sir. I suppose you know your father got to join his lodge before he died. No, I didn't. But you think that helped? Well, it made him powerful happy. And they say he died 'with the most loveliest smile on his face.' Was he placid? You mean to say, Ms. Williams after all them years you worked for them they give you the gate? I don't understand you, Frankie. I think you should say, "After all those years they gave you the gate." But I still don't understand because they didn't give me any gate. I'm sorry, Ms. Williams. Emilio said they put the slug on you. What I'm trying to say is you ain't got no job no more? - 'Is that it?' - That's right. Only, don't you think you ought to say you no longer have a position, hmm? That's all I wanna know. - Who's running the joint? - I beg your pardon? Who's the boss, the big guy, the headman? [laughs] Well, you certainly speak strangely, Frankie but I think I'm beginning to understand you. Charley Smith is the president of our board of education. 'He runs the bank. Now you know, you remember him?' Yeah, I remember him. That fresh little.. Sorry. That fresh little guy that was so smart at figures? That's it. Oh, he's done so well. He's down at his bank now. I'm sure he'd be very glad to see you. That's fine. I'll be glad to see him, too. He said he'd be here at 2:30. What time is it now? 2:38 and a half, if this thing's on a level. Where'd you get that watch? - Oh, I just picked it up. - How? One of the local boys was eating a sack of popcorn. But he won't miss it. What does a guy want with a watch in this town, anyway? Wait here. Some people say bankers are hard, they have no sentiment but I tell you here and now I will not see that little schoolhouse destroyed not for all the money in the world. [telephone ringing] Yes? [woman on phone] 'A Mr. Frankie Rogers' 'to see you, Mr. Smith.' Well, what do you think of that? Show him in. Will you gentlemen excuse me, please? - Certainly, Charley. - Of course, Charley. [Charley] 'Well, well, Frankie.' 'How are you?' [door shuts] This is a funny one. I was just talking about you. - Why is it, Charley? - Now, let's see how you look. Hey, you haven't changed much. I suppose you might say that comes from living right eh, Frankie? Yes, you might say. Nice place you got here. Why, you haven't seen a thing. Sit down, sit down. No, thanks. I don't wanna waste your time. No, no, at least you'll let me show you through the bank. Now, here's a little idea of my own. Take a look at this burglar alarm. If anybody just walks in front of that at night, it goes off sort of a radio beam arrangement. Not a chance for anybody to get away with a thing. I see. This safe is the very last word. I can hardly get in there myself. Are you insured, Charley? Yes, yes, everything insured. Everything in apple pie order. What do you wanna do, Frankie? You want a job? I can't fix you up here but I understand the chain works is opening up soon. Mr. Hamilton. Yes, the town certainly is booming. - How about Ms. Williams? - Oh, she's fine. - What do you mean? - Well. Don't you think it'd be a good idea if you put her back to work? Well, she has her pension, after all. She's done her service, now she should have her rest. This new school building takes care of 500 kids. What we need is you within our teaching staff. Don't you worry about Ms. Williams, Frankie. We'll take care of her alright. Yeah, she'll sit in that little, old house and wither and die, thinking about you and me and the rest of the kids. How about putting her back to work, Charley? I'll take it up with the next board meeting, Frankie. And I wanna thank you for coming in. You gonna be in town long? - I don't think so. - Do you need any money? No, thanks. Do what you can for her, will you? I will, Frankie. I certainly will. And you've given me an idea. Okay. When do we knock it over? Oh, this looks like a cinch. I've been standing here for over an hour I ain't seen a single copper. We're not knocking it over. This is my hometown. - We're leaving. - Where for? - Cleveland. - Pardon me. Can you tell me where the Chamber of Commerce is? I don't know. I'm a stranger here. Well, you know, it's been a long time, 15 years. They say she's a big star. I can't believe she's getting along, alright? Any chance for a touch? If there was, I wouldn't make it. I don't know whether I'm gonna like this town or not. You've been talking about nothing all the way from.. What's on your mind? Well, I hid some dough and I got in a taxi. The taxi driver was an old guy, buckling at the knees just doing the best he could, I guess. And a copper gave him a ticket for going three feet through a stop line. So you socked the copper? Oh, no, I didn't, I tried to reason with him then I socked him. What did you say to him? 'I says to him, I says' "A fine job you've got, making people unhappy. "Look at this old man here, he's just trying "and you come along and gum it all up. "What did he do?" I says "What did he do that would hurt anybody?" You know what that copper says to me? He says, "If you don't shut up I'll slug and throw you in a can." That's what he says. So I seen, I couldn't reason with him. - What did you do? - That's when I socked him. - And what'd it cost you? - Six months. And I might say that the jail here stinks. You know, it's a funny thing about coppers. What's funny about em'? Well, I knew a guy once, a friend of mine. He was an alright guy, too. He got on the police force. The minute he got a load of himself all dressed up in those brass buttons he-he was a different guy. I don't like him, either. And I guess they're just trying to do the best they can. I wish you wouldn't use that word "Can." Why not? Can is a verb. It may be a verb to you, but to me it's a joint where you do six months. [instrumental music] # I long for a chance # # Will bring you romance # # But my heart jumps when you're near # # Those hump and thump and oh dear # # Oh dear grab a telephone # # Take me out along # # I maybe a movie star # # To tell you # # The things in my # # Heart ## [all applaud] Carol, you were swell. You were a cinch. Nothing can stop you. [male #4] 'Hey, Carol.' That was swell, but you gotta get out of that dress and get out of my way. - You didn't like it? - Sure, I liked it. But the dame just come to. Somebody hit her with a cold towel or something. Yeah, they should have slipped her a mickey. Some other time, Carol. [indistinct chattering] [instrumental music] Carol. [music continues] Frankie. [indistinct chatter] What do you think of this paper? I don't think so much of it. [indistinct] I get laughs out of it. Did you laugh when you read about my trouble? I didn't mean that. It should have been a big laugh. Oh, I see old man Bunky's dead. - Yes. - That's good. You know, I hated that old buzzard. Beat me up when I was a kid because my dad licked his.. He was just a punk, how'd you like that? You mustn't hate anybody, Frankie. It's no good. Okay, I won't if you say so. He was no good when he was alive and I don't see that dying makes him any better. What time is it? - 12:30. - Oh, I'm going. It was swell seeing you. When will I see you again? I don't know. What are you gonna do? - I don't know. - I do. You're gonna stay here, you gonna get a job. Why? I want you to. On the level? On the level. Gee, I'm stuck. I... don't know what to do. Will you kiss me, Frankie? Tomorrow night? Tomorrow night. Mouse, loan me that tie, will you? - It matches the suit. - Sure. Hate to leave you, fellas but this is my big night. Yeah, so I see. - Same dame? - Not a dame. Somebody else. You are the luckiest guy that ever lived. If you fell in a lake, you'd come up with a handful of fish. I ain't lucky at all. This is a game of science and skill. The trouble with you is you don't concentrate. Yeah, I'll concentrate on knocking your head off the next time you deal one from the bottom. - What do you mean? - You know what I mean. What do you got? I got one, two three, four aces. May be you got four aces but that ain't the hand I dealt ya. - What do you mean? - You know what I mean. I think you're being very unethical. Explain them words. I think you're a crook. And what are you? I'm just a victim of society that's what I am. Yeah and you're a crook, too. Then we are a couple of crooks, is that it? Yeah. That's it. Oh, you wanna fight, huh? Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on? Cut it out.Stopit. Ha.. You are so.. Why I'll break.. Ah, I'm sorry, Frankie. I'm sorry, too. It's okay. Ah, you throw one at me and you hit Frankie, that's how good you are. Cut it out, cut it out. You ain't gonna get nowhere fightin' like that. When you lose, we gotta stick together. Come on, shake hands. Boy, I wish they had a hunk of beef steak. - Good evening. - Yeah. I'm Mr. Hicks, the manager. I'd like to speak to you about your bill. We've only been here three days. But you have no baggage. Show the beat, will you, fellas? See you later. - Come in, Mr. Hicks. - Yeah. Yeah, come in. Have a chair. Some discussion about the bill? - Yes, there is. - Well, sit down there. Hm, do you ever play, uh, cards? Gee, this is swell. I certainly fixed things up good. It wasn't the doorknob, Carol. I tried to stop two boys who were punchin' each other and I ran into one myself. What's the idea to put that? Let me fix up that eye. Let's see how you... Oh, wait a minute, if you put that on I won't be able to see at all. That doesn't matter. I'll be here. Yeah? Oh, I guess I don't have to see you. There were lots of times when I couldn't. But you know, Carol.. ...I always had a kind of a feeling you was around in some ways. You know what I mean? Yes, Frankie. Gee, this is cold. Where'd you learn these things? It's nothing. I was gonna take you out tonight and have some fun. Here we are, just you and me in a sliced potato. But it's swell. - Good evening. - Good evening. Did the boys pay the bill? - I paid the bill. - What do you mean? They got me into a poker game. - Did you lose? - One week's rent. [sighs] That's fine. Yes. Next time. Don't worry, I'll give you a chance to get it back. - Goodnight. - 'Goodnight.' [dramatic music] Hey! Taxi! Come on, driver, step on it. Get going. Hurry up. Hurry, let's get there! - You all set? - Yeah. I'd like a piece of that lemon cream pie. - Why? - Just in case we lose. Well, that's fair enough. Let's go. [tires screeching] [gunshots] [people screaming] [gunshots] [barking] What's happening? What's happening? What's happening? What's happening? Good news? - Not bad. - An offer? - Kind of an offer. - How many weeks? No, it's an invitation to a class reunion. What's that? Oh, a fellow in my little hometown who made a lot of money wants to get all his old classmates together. Says he'll pay all the expenses. Oh, I know, it's one of those things where everybody gets together and lies to each other about their success. I wonder if he sent one to Frankie. - Frankie? - Yeah. The boy I was with last night. What's his last name? Frankie who? Rogers. Frankie Rogers. What does he look like? Looks very nice. At least I think so. You saw him. Well, does he look anything like that? [dramatic music] That's what I did and that's what happened. I didn't kill the guy and that's the truth. And that's just what they won't believe. - But I'll tell 'em. - You won't tell 'em anything. I don't want you to. I don't want you to come to see me no more. But why? Because you can't help me and you can hurt yourself. Can't you see that? Did you send a reunion invitation to Frankie Rogers? I've tried everything I can think of, Mr. Smith but I haven't been able to find the address for him. Yeah, you can find it now, alright it's the Cleveland County Jail. From the looks of this it'll soon be the Ohio State Penitentiary. Take a look at that. I knew that boy, Tim, I went to school with him. [Tim] 'He's sure in trouble now.' Look, Tim, I've got $50. Do you want me to pay you what I owe you or would you let me go there and see him? I'd like to help him if I can. Forget about me, son. I can wait. You go help your friend. See me when you get back. Thanks, Tim. Frankie? What do you want? - How'd you make out? - Okay. When does the jury get it? This afternoon sometime maybe. Good luck, Frankie. Thanks, Mouse. What do you think is gonna happen, John? Well, I don't know. What are you gonna say this afternoon? I don't know, Carol. Maybe I shouldn't have taken this case. After all, it's Frankie's life I've got in my hands. I've never been a trial lawyer. What does that mean, John? Well, out there you know, in a way I.. ...just fuss around trying to sell insurance and do a little work on mortgages and leases at times. I'm scared stiff. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Until a moment ago.. ...I had no idea what I could say to you. The defendant himself has suggested a plan 'and it's this very fact' which allows me to throw him so confidently on your mercy. 'I've known the defendant since we were children.' I remember, one afternoon.. ...Frankie helped me take a.. ...a fish hook out of my finger. I know that nothing ever happened to help that boy but I've never heard him complain. 'In fact, even now when he sits before you' 'all but condemned, not by you' 'but by the forces which inevitably brought him here' he has no complaint to make. It's not of himself but of me that he's thinking. He asks me to bring glory on myself. Not mercy for himself. 'I tell you there's much to be honored in such a man.' 'If we could take that which' 'is so fine in him' and build on it.. ...we could well be proud. Well, what are we to achieve with destruction? Would that make the world a better place then? 'Why can't we begin here and now the very process' which would eliminate these cruel moments from life? Why can't we give him aid rather than unfeeling censor? Don't you see the, the defendant himself has shown us the way? John, you were swell. Your Honor, Mr. Foreman and ladies and gentlemen of the jury. In all of my experiences as an attorney and as a prosecutor I've never seen a more straightforward case. Let me sum it up for you once more. Three known criminals went into a respectable place of business armed, prepared to commit murder and with the intention of robbery. 'The proprietor ' 'a law-abiding citizen of this community' attempted to save his property. And he was mercilessly killed. The defendant, Frankie Rogers out of a state penitentiary, but a short time fired the shot in cold blood. 'I needn't call Rogers a fiend' 'or a foul blot on humanity' 'or use any other dramatic term' 'the truth is obvious.' But Rogers is prepared to commit murder again and you are in duty bound to prevent this and that's why the state demands the jury turn a verdict of guilty and also demands.. ...a death penalty. [male #5] 'We, the jury' 'find the defendant..' What are you talking about? You had two strikes on you before you started. You were swell! Gee, I never had anybody say things like that about me before. Where'd you learn all them things? Wasn't he swell, Carol? Well, it wouldn't have been so bad if there was a recommendation for mercy but... there wasn't any. What does that mean, John? Oh, why don't you two stop? Why, gee, you'd think this was a funeral. I'm sorry, Frankie. I just did the best I could. Bye, John. Bye, Carol. What are we gonna do now, John? I don't know, Carol. I'd thought that on my way back to Illinois I might stop by St. Mary's for that.. ...that reunion, but...not now. No. Do you think if we went back to the reunion we might get Charley Smith to help Frankie? Always the artist, eh, Wallace, admiring the pictures? Well, I never went in much for that art stuff myself. Mrs. Smith selected all these. Charles is clever. Don't you think it was smart of him to bring you all here? No, I think it was a very nice sentiment. Thank you. Of course, it is for publicity. Bob, have you seen any of your old friends? Yeah. Walked around this afternoon. Saw Harry Truman. Hardly knew him. And I saw Tom. [chuckles] He didn't look any too good, either. And I stopped at the new pool room downtown and there wasn't a soul in the place that I knew. I don't know. Coming back to a little town is not so good, I guess after a long time. Well, you just seem to see the years sit down on 'em. That's right, Bob. The years sit down. Ms. Williams. [instrumental music] Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late. I thought I'd find you all here. This party's a bust. Yeah, Carol. We're just talking about it. What do you think is wrong? We all know what's wrong. It's Frankie. What can we do, John, anything? I don't think so. They denied the appeal. Well, do you think we could get Charley to help him? No. Carol and I talked to him. I don't think he could help anyway, it's too late. Hey, how about some chow, some supper, my friend? This is your last meal, Rogers. What do you want? What do you mean? A slug of booze or anything you want. Sure. Get me a big hucker of whiskey and drink it yourself. Okay. Hiya, Mouse. Okay, Frankie. Well, it took us a long time to get here but here we are. Yeah. Not far from heaven. And we're a lot further from heaven than you think. [indistinct yelling] [sirens wailing] [whistle blowing] [dramatic music] - Where are you going? - Back to my hometown. That's where I started, that's where I'll finish if I make it. Thanks, Joe. Well, here we are, right back where we started from. Here's where I used to sit. It's easy enough for you to remember you've got your initials carved all over it. That's my desk there. And boy, did I suffer in that seat. Ms. Williams used to ask the darndest questions. But she was always sweet about it, don't you think? You bet, she was. Don't say anything against her. I was only kidding. Where'd you sit, John? Right over there. No, you didn't. Did you? Yeah, that's where I sat, alright. - That desk there was Carol's. - Gee, what a memory! Well, you're sure about that John? Yes, I'm sure of it. I know because I sat there and Carol sat there and.. I guess we all know who sat here. Frankie. [dramatic music] Well, hello, hello. How's everybody today? Hello, Carol, hello, John, Wallace. - Bob, have a good sleep? - Fine, thanks. Ah, that's fine. Carol, I got something for you. There you are. Got one for each one of you. Bob, Wallace and John. Now, you are all members of the committee. You know, I'd have been here sooner but I had a little business at the bank. You know how those things go. George, you needn't wait any longer. We can take care of ourselves. Everything all set? That's fine. How does the old place look? Not much change, eh? Well, I want you all to take a good look at it. We're tearing it down next week. 'We just can't keep it any longer.' 'Too much development, real estate.' Ms. Williams hasn't shown up yet, eh? No, Charley. No, Ms. Williams isn't here yet. Well, these are for her. Well, she'd be along soon. And I'll bet you I can tell you the very first thing she does. What she always used to do Friday afternoon the first thing. [chuckles] You see, I got you stuck already. - We sang, right? - 'Yup, that's right.' [Charley] 'You know, I think we all have a little drink.' What do you say we have one while we're waiting for Ms. Williams? Yeah, it's just a few refreshments I arranged. Don't think this is lemonade, either. I had George put plenty of my best stuff in this. 'Now, you see, out there where the duck pond is now' 'we're gonna build a swell golf course.' Plan's all drawn up and everything. So the way things are turning out there just isn't room for our little schoolhouse anymore but if you might say, that's life right, Carol? Yes, John. That's life, I guess. [laughs] Bob? - Thanks, Charley. - Wallace? - And John. - Thank you, Charley. Now, how about a little toast befitting the occasion? Carol, you seem very quiet. Will you make it? Here's to.. ...Frankie. [intense music] [music continues] Thank you, Charley. Of course, on such a happy occasion it's very regrettable that one of our classmates is in trouble. And I can understand exactly how we all feel about him. After all, what could we expect? I tried to help him. It's only been a short time since he called on me at the bank. I offered to help him find him a job. I even offered to lend him money. You know, I might have got killed or robbed or something. I showed him all around the bank told him just how everything worked. 'I am deeply sorry, indeed' 'but this is an occasion of gaiety.' 'It's a reunion.' It's for fun. It's for you. And I want you all to enter into the spirit of things. Carol, you've been in the theater. Won't you sing or dance for us just like you used to? I'm afraid, you'll have to excuse me, Charley. There's really nothing I can do. But I would like to ask you a question. Sure, go right ahead. Fire away, Carol. Did you try to help Frankie? Yes. Yes, I did. Just what did you do? Well, I think that's beside the point. I told you what I tried to do for him. After all, I think he deserved just what he got. 'What did he do? He-he stole.' 'He was in the reformatory, he was in prison.' 'He was offered help and he committed murder.' And I don't see any point now worrying about Frankie Rogers any longer. [thud] Gee. Hello, Carol. 'Ms. Williams.' 'Hiya, Charley.' 'And Bob, Kischler.' Hello, John. Nice seeing you all again. Charley give you that job back, Ms. Williams? Why, it doesn't matter about me, Frankie. How did you manage to come here? I guess you all know I've been in a little trouble. Them guys ain't a bad bunch. I thought a lot about this.. ...little party he was giving that I'm gonna come down for a little while. 'I gotta get right back.' Can't stay very long. Well.. How you guys all been doing? Fine, Frankie, fine. Great. Been doing great, Frankie. Good. I guess I don't have to ask how you been doing, Charley? Yes, Frankie, yes. Sorry you can't stay. Before I go home, [indistinct] come all the way from Illinois just to help me beat a rep but no, so. Wasn't all John's fault. And a small speech too. Same speech you made here one afternoon. That was a long time ago. Well, I guess there ain't much more to say. It was nice seeing all of you and... I wish you all a lot of luck. Where are you going? I don't know. Thanks for coming along, Frankie. We know you can't stay so we won't keep you. We know how it is. Yes, we know how it is. I know how it is and you know how it is, too. You just said that Frankie was not a law-abiding citizen. Did you ever think about yourself? Did you ever think about what caused Frankie to get into trouble? No, all you ever cared about was money. Money, position. Your own wife told me last night that getting us back here was nothing but a publicity stunt. Don't you think that's fun bringing us all back here 'to parade yourself in front of us?' You know we never made a dime and now we're all broke! And that wouldn't be so bad, but it's the way you look at it. - Carol, you must... - What did you ever do for him? What did any of the rest of us ever do for him? I'll tell you what we did, nothing! And I'll tell you something else I hate what you stand for and I hate you! No, no, no, Carol. No, you are wrong. You mustn't hate anybody. That ain't right. It ain't no good, remember? I used to hate people, too but that's easy, but it ain't right. I know the guy who used to beat me over the head with a rubber hose I hated him. One day I saw him going after a guy who was makin' a break that filled him full of lead. He dropped right at my feet. When I saw the look in that guy's eyes it took all the hate out of me forever. I went to get him a tin cup full of water but... he never lived to drink it. When I came back.. ...he was dead. Come on, Carol. Charley's alright. We're all alright. I'm glad to see you all doing so well. I know you all done the best you could. Maybe I did, too. I don't know. I gotta go. Come on, Carol, tell Charley you're sorry. If you don't, I ain't never gonna be happy no more. I'm sorry. That's swell, Carol. Ain't gonna need this. Bye, John. Bye, Charley. So long. Goodbye, Ms. Williams. I know Charley's gonna get that job back for you. So long, Bob, Kischler. Bye, Carol, so long. [indistinct yelling] It was nice of Frankie to come to see us, wasn't it? Ms. Williams, we were just saying before you came that probably the first thing you'd let us do... I know, just what we all used to do on Friday afternoon. - Is that right, Charley? - Yes, Ms. Williams. [gunshots] [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues]
