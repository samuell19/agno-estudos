But in Sartre the question of absurdity has clear historical antecedents. For one, a violent need to explain war. Camus, Sartre, the whole existential movement is a consequence-- Or perhaps a better way to put it is a reaction to the consequences of war. PROFESSOR: The natural order-- (chuckles) The natural order, if there is such a thing, has been violated. Chaos exists, not as a mental possibility but as a physical and emotional fact. War is chaos, and war was the existentialists' primary reality. ♪♪ (headphones: jazz) How to explain it in all its terrifying horror except by acknowledging that-- That no explanation satisfies, that human existence must be without rhyme, without reason, that in the face of sustained horror the argument for an absurd universe becomes the only rational argument. Now, there are precedents, of course, for this kind of thinking. In Nietzsche, for example, in the logical positivist hypothetical suspension of causal connections. But let's see how you handle that in your term papers. I'm talked out. You're free to leave, unless there are questions. Are we to include a discussion of The Fall in our papers, Professor Rogers? Absolutely. And at least one of Sartre's plays. Either No Exit or The Flies. I had a question about that, Professor. Where are they supposed to be in No Exit? They're in a room with no windows or mirrors. The door is locked, and they must endure each other's company without relief or privacy. And Sartre defines this as hell. Seems a plausible definition to me. (students laughing) I got that book on Genet. Oh, good. It's the finest analysis of being an outsider I've ever read, and it applies as much to race as it does to homosexuality. Well, he talks of exclusion in such clear terms. He makes you see-- I mean, really see and feel how a society can impose group definitions that an individual is powerless against. Oh, it's a good book. It's a wonderful book. He touches every feeling, every mental attitude connected with exclusion. I'm glad you found it. There are books that can make a difference in a life. Next week is our last class. That's right. You've been a good group. I've enjoyed this class tremendously. You're terrific. So alive and terrific. Well... thank you. Your husband appreciates you? My husband? I mean-- I-I-I bet your husband appreciates you tremendously. You're so full of life. That's very sweet. I'll remember to tell him. Well, I'll see you next semester in Critical Approaches. MAN (on radio): A whole category of problems revolve and revolve around those abstract definitions of what is or is not acceptable as art. (door closes) - (woman)Victor? - I'm in here! (man continues talking on radio) What's the insane moment for today? - Just look in the refrigerator. - Yeah? - Go on. - All right, all right. Now what? Just bring the whole tray. Oh, boy. - Come on. Bring it up. - You mean you want me to climb up? - It's a ceremony. - Can't we have it on land? (sighs) Oh, Victor. - (hiccups) - (laughs) Okay, okay. - Oh, Victor, I'm falling! - Aah! On your ass! What are we celebrating? Married to me for 10 years and still can't say the word "ass"? What are we celebrating? They are buying Landscapes in Blue, Sara. The museum? For their permanent collection. - (sighs) - I'm a genuine success! Your husband is a genuine, black success. (both laughing) MAN (on radio): The black artist must have absolute freedom to interpret his experience, both stylistically and in every other manner, as would any other artist. No demand can be considered appropriate of him other than the one simple, clear mandate that he interpret that which is real for him in a meaningful way. Two more weeks! Why don't we take a place for the summer? Where? The place upstate where all those Puerto Rican ladies live in those old Victorian houses. I dream about that place. Yeah, well, you would. It's like a-- a-- A painting. I know. Why don't we take a house for a month. I need to be near a library. They got libraries up there. Those ladies read all the time. You know what I think I'm gonna do? I'll pass myself off as a housepainter. I'm going from door to door offering my services. Si, si. Me encanta, me encanta. Si, si. On what basis did you arrive at this conclusion? All the data seemed to point in that direction. But that's the trap. It's a purely speculative conclusion. Any logician would stand you on your head. - Does that mean that I fail? - Logically. (chuckles) No, your term paper takes you out of danger. I like philosophy, but I don't like logic. A lot of students don't. Unfortunately, it is one of the required courses. Are you teaching Critical Approaches? And an advanced course in logical positivism. - Which I suggest you avoid. - (chuckles) I still enjoyed the class. It's mostly you, I guess. (chuckles) You're so bright and lively. A real inspiration. Well, thank you. And lucky, with a husband and all. A husband? What? What is this thing they've all got about my having a husband? (man) Got you in a close-up, Professor. Oh, wow. You look just like Pearl McCormack in The Scar of Shame, Philadelphia Colored Players, 1927. (Sara laughing) I've always wanted to know why, as a filmmaker, you take so many of my classes. You could be a movie star, Professor! Dorothy Dandridge, Bright Road. Gerald Mayer, MGM, 1953. Any chance you'd act in my senior project, Professor? Who-- (laughing) No. (laughing continues) Oh! (laughing continues) (footsteps descending stairs) (woman speaking Spanish) (engine off) (no audible dialogue) (women speaking Spanish) (woman speaking Spanish) (laughing) (women speaking Spanish) WOMAN: ¡Ay! ¡Ay! ¡Ay! Ah-ah-ah-ah-aah! ¡Échale! ¡Échale! (trilling) ¡Ay! ¡Ay! I'm sure he wouldn't mind some kind of celebration, just the three of us (door slams) I don't think that would be such a good idea. He hates parties. Huh? No, it's finished. I turned in my grades today. Yeah. We can come on Friday, probably. I'll ask. All right. Mama wants to celebrate with us. You did these today in Riverview? Yes. See any houses? Two. Wanna drive up on Sunday? Yeah. What's the matter? I feel light-headed. Like I've been walking around in a dream. That place is unbelievable. It's like a whole new universe to paint. You know, I could do a whole series. Today was like a release. That's what one of the houses looked like. It's pretty. Any libraries around? There's a small lending library. But odds are good they don't carry Kant or Hegel. But you could drive down to New York once or twice a week. You wanna eat out? We could. I need to save my strength for all that driving back and forth. (sarcastically) "Drive down to New York once or twice a week." If I did something artistic, like write or act, would that get me a little more consideration? If you were any good. Nothing I do leads to ecstasy. You stay in a trance. You haven't noticed that? A kind of private, ecstatic trance. It's like living with a musician who sits around all day blowing his horn. What's the matter? Hegel and the boys let you down? I could be another Dorothy Dandridge. I'm so reasonable. Uh, are you sure this hasn't got something to do with your mother? My mother? Well, she's an actress, isn't she? That was just an example. I see. Uh, look, would you still like to go out and eat and put this mulatto crisis on hold? (laughing) I'm sorry. I was just thinking about your mother and that bit she does on the light-skinned Negro. What does all this ethnic humor have to do with anything? Look, I'm fucking starving. I've had two espressos. All day. SARA'S VOICE: Yet our consciousness, delving down, which reveals to us the deeper we go, an ever more original personality capable of private ecstatic experience that is often undefinable in words. To call it ecstasy forces us to borrow from the theologians who have used the word in terms of man's immediate connectedness and/or apprehension of-- MAN: What on earth are you reading? I've rarely seen anyone read with such concentration. Why are you reading with such concentration? I'm doing research for a paper on ecstatic experience. From a theological perspective, no doubt. No, though I'm using religious ecstasy as a point of departure. Whose? Saint Thomas Aquinas, with his rational repression of the experience? Or Saint Theresa, who was a truly remarkable woman? Or we can go back a little further to the deviant Gnostics who were really pre-Christian in their thinking. Man in more intuitive harmony with the divine, et cetera, et cetera. A definite psychic orientation. What's the thesis of your paper? That the religious boundaries around ecstasy are too narrow. That if, as the Christians define it, ecstasy is an immediate apprehension of the divine-- - Hmm. - then the divine is energy. Amorphous energy. Artists, for example, have frequent ecstatic experiences. That's a lucid approach. It's definitely pre-Christian. Christianity has had a devastating effect upon man as an intuitive creature. - Wouldn't you say? - Who are you? (scoffs) In which life? In this life, I am an out-of-work actor who once studied for the ministry. In other lives, so the psychics tell me, I have been an Italian count, an English lord, even a Confederate soldier. Apparently, this is my first incarnation as a Negro. I must have built up a lot of karmic debt. (laughing) You think that's funny? Victor? I'm sorry I'm late. I got talking to this really wonderful man in the library, and I just lost track of the time. What-- I can't hear you. I can meet you at Mama's. No, it would probably be easier. All right. ♪♪ (jazz: man singing) To my son-in-law. That's what happens when you have children. They beget husbands and paintings, and soon we're talking about museums and galleries, and the whole world becomes larger than life. (laughs) I always knew you'd try hard not to be a failure. Oh, you're concerned about that? Oh, I've thought about it. Not with any blame, of course. I wouldn't blame you for being a failure. I'm not white. (Victor, Sara laughing) Racial excuses are the best. I can always tell my friends that you were talented but unseen. That's very generous of you. SARA: How's the play going? Oh, it's one of those family dramas. I play someone's mother. Someone else plays my husband. "I'll stand before God as this family's guiding light, a beacon of strength and humility." It's a thoroughly colored play. Oh, yes, we sing, we dance. There's even a character who runs track. (laughs) Leila, tell me something. What do you dream of doing? Oh. I-- I'm not a snob, really. I don't long to do Macbeth. I-- I would love to do a real 60-year-old Negro lady who thinks more about men than God. (giggling) That's what you should do, darling. You should stop writing all those dissertations and write a play about your mother. Oh! Oh, it would be too eccentric, Mama. Nobody would believe it's about a real person. You've got that bad look you get when you're tired. I have two papers to finish. I'm not through the research on either one. Still building your castles?

VICTOR: Why would anybody go to Australia for the summer? WOMAN: It's completely furnished. - (laughing) - (chattering, faint) - VICTOR:Sara! - I'm down here! Come upstairs! There's an unbelievable studio up here! It's like a dream! (footsteps) It's pastoral. What do you mean? Uh, it's got nothing to do with concrete and granite. It's soft. It's specific. Those things are abstractions. There are perfect still lifes out there. I don't have to change a thing. It's a nice house. It'll be the first time we ever lived in a house. - You look terrific. - (chuckles) All healthy, correct. (both laughing) Where's that real estate lady? I'm gonna tell her we gonna take this place. I think I'll paint you right by that window. That'll be my first project. (footsteps) Carlos! (chuckles) Classic artist-in-residence. Ever the purist. That's unfair, man. Well, it is pure.

That really tells a story. ♪♪ (drums) ♪♪ (man singing in Spanish) I have a need to make specific references. ♪♪ (continues, fades out) You know, you're amazing. You just paint, like a child. (chuckles) I envy that a little. No matter how abstract, I still have landscape references. So you admit that. It's in the underpainting. That's why I try and hide. There's nothing wrong with telling stories. Lots of painters reach a dead end with form. You know, you really should see that place. - It'll even have you doing landscapes. - (both laugh) We didn't even drink for the acquisition. - I love the painting, man. - (laughs) Hey! - Yeah. - Give me my wine. (both laughing) Get some cups. - Gracias. - De nada. Salud. - Not too bad. - Not too good. (both laughing) You know, I realize for the first time that in many ways I've made Carlos my mentor. - You do defer to him. - No, that's not it. It's just that his work is very pure. In many ways I've tried to emulate that purity, and it's not me. What is this? You sell a painting you love, and you deny it? No. It's just that I never realized before what an influence he's had over me. Now it's over. Oh, Lord! Careful. Ah. What's over? You know, you have an amazing knack for holding on to the thread of a conversation. What's over? My efforts at purity. Excuse me. I'm spending the summer here, and I'd like to be able to borrow some books on your library loan system. - Novels? - No. Research books. - On what subject? - Ecstatic experience. I see. Just fill out this form. There-- Ah! Too representational. What do you mean? Too easy. You mean, to paint people and things is a cop-out? I never put it that way. I just feel that abstract work is purer, that's all. In the painterly sense, it deals more with simpler truths, like color, form, space. And people and things are dishonest. What is this honesty cop-out bit? You want to nail me to the cross for a coward and a cheat? (giggling) It hurts to laugh when you can't move. Light. Ah! It's incredible from here. Mmm. You know, when you're thinking-- When you're dealing with people, you have to think of light differently. What? You have a good face. That's not what you said. (laughing) Why do you do that? Hmm? Say "what" when you've heard every word I've said? What about my face? It's cold. Analytical. Can I stand still and hit you at the same time? (chuckles) How about "noble"? - That's a word your mother hates. - Ah. (laughs) Ain't that a blip. Where'd that come from? I don't know. One of those things I've always wanted to say at a faculty meeting. Turn to someone pompous, like Warren or Levine, and say, "Ain't that a blip?" (laughs) That is totally unlike you. Mmm. - Are you pretty? - Mmm. Or is it just the light? You want a murder the first week in this house? (both laughing) The light! Up.

He analyzes from a psychological and physiological standpoint a subject who is possessed. In this experience, the subject is mounted by the god in question, (typing continues) I.e., his behavior changes radically as he begins to assume the personality of the god in question. Similar experiences are described by those who have studied Greek and Roman Dionysian rites and African rites of passage. The striking note for our purposes is that during the experience the possessed one is unconscious. Afterwards, he scarcely remembers what happened to him. Yet a sensation of physical well-being, of mental alertness, sometimes clairvoyance generally accompanies the return to consciousness. The ecstatic moment is, so to speak, after the fact. When you read someone-- For instance, looking at me, what happens inside you? I don't understand. Can you see my future? I see that you are very intelligent. And secretive. Anyone can say that. My face tells you that. I don't understand. I want to understand what it feels like to see something that has not yet happened. I see you with a tall, dark man with a top hat.

So, she wanted to know-- She said, "How the devil did you find this place?" I said, "I don't remember, but it had something to do with Wedgewood." She said, "What's Wedgwood?" She doesn't know what Wedgwood is. No way I can explain it to her, right? It's neither wood, nor is it wedged. I said I didn't have a piece of Wedgwood. I had a drink with a man by the name of Wedgewood. And we had gone north. I don't remember where it was, but after we crossed the bridge, it was 12 bars-- saloons, that is-- north. So I said-- As I got to thinking about it, I said, "Well, you know, this is like old times." You know what it's like when you get to thinking about old times. - Victor used to do that all the time. - Ask her about old times. Go out and not come back for a couple of days.

Gracias. - Excuse me. (Spanish resumes) This is very important. I have something I want to tell you. I have something-- This is-- Uh-- Uh! Uh! Shh. His father is Spanish, but his mother is a full-blooded American black woman. What? His father left home when he was six years old. Four, man. This is the beginning of one of his jealous tirades. (laughs) Victor was raised by a possessive mother - who felt he should never be left out of anything. - Oh. Oh. - SARA: Victor. - Huh? Carlos! Oh! - (laughs) - How good it is to see you. - Good to see you, Sara. - Oh, thank you. Oh, this is Duke Richards, everybody. We're doing a movie together. Um, Duke, this is Carlos, an old family friend. - Carlos. - Glad to meet you. And this is Celia, a new family friend. Celia. And this is Victor. Hello. Were you in that movie, Ten Street Exteriors? - Yes, that's right. - I remember you well, man. - You do? - You were wonderful in that. - Oh! - Thank you. How kind of you. This is gonna be a-a real party. ♪♪ (salsa) Well, well, well, well. The silent purist has a touch of lechery in his bones. - Come here, darling. - Hey, man. Come on. - No, I want to dance. - (arguing) You don't wanna dance with me? Sara, darling. I want to show you something. ♪♪ (vocalizing) I always forget you can't dance. Hey, man! - What kind of behavior is this, man? - You know what? I really resent your Latin ancestry, and I reserve the right to express it. - That's right. - Leave me out of it, man. You come to a party, people dance. They fool around. None of this bullshit about who can dance with who, what, when and where. That's no dancing. That's no party, man. Hey. Now, that's really well put, baby. What is this, a performance? A cinematic moment? - Hey, hey, hey, man. - Huh? Hey, man. Hey, man. Hey, man. Get a hold of that. Don't do it. This is really beginning to get pretty strange. (laughing) That's very good. That's like dancing. Man, man, man. You say that enough times, you can't stop. You just go, "I don't know, man. And this is how it goes, man. And I believe it's always happening, man!" You know, that's really very true and, uh, very well put. There's a rhythm of speech and how that sometimes defines the truth. What the fuck is he talking about? Leave it to you to run into some goddamn actor. What the hell do you two talk about on the screen? You sit there and read from Plato's Republic? Huh? You wanna dance with me? You wanna dance with me? I'll dance by my goddamn self. Watch this. Ready for it? This is it. Come on. Let's get on down. Take up with the music. Get it on. You know what I think we should do? I think we should all go out and sleep under the stars tonight. I dare everybody to follow me! Oh. Come in the-- Damn, it's cold! Shit! Come in! - Come on! - It takes me back to my childhood. (speaking Spanish) I go in, but just like I am. Oh! (gasps) (coughs) Is it cold? (laughing) I hate water. I feel like I'm drowning in the bathtub. I hear you, honey. ¡Ay! I'm cold. SARA: I'll go get you some clothes. (splashing) (coughing) VICTOR: Where's the rest of 'em? (Carlos speaking Spanish) It's true. It's damn irresistible. (Duke shouts) It's cold. (men conversing, laughing) Ah. (growling) Give me some bag. What you doing? You think this is a funny moment? This is no funny moment! (growling) (laughing) Give me some bag. Give me some bag! Stop! Leave me out of it, man! What you doing? (shouting in Spanish) Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! Oh! You think you can go around taking that thing out in front of me? It's uncalled for for you to fling your little private ecstasies in my face! This is not one of your classes. Don't lecture to me. Don't fuck around then! Don't you take your dick out like it was artistic, like it's some goddamn paintbrush! Maybe that's what's uneven, that I got nothin' to take out! I'm on shaky ground. Well, that's not the kind of feeling you like. Order. That's what Victor loves about me is there's no chaos anywhere. That's the quality in you that even I admit to counting on.
