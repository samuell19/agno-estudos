Yagmur! Yagmur, stop! Water and Fire ''There is no such thing as coincidence. lf it's meant to happen, it happens. All of this was meant to happen, and it did. Fire met water. But neitherthe waterevaporated, northe fire went out. The flames swallowed the entire city. All they felt was pain. And what a pain...'' Honey, l loved the book's cover. l'm so excited! You are the first to officially read the book. Call me when you finish it. l know. l promise, l'll finish it by evening, l'll call you then. l love you, honey. l love you too. ''Theirfirst time meeting had been painful. The man was already scarred but did not show it. The beads of sweat on his face were the only sign of the pain inside.'' -Are you okay, brother?. -l'm fine, l'm fine. -lf you need anything, let me know. -Alright. God damn it. How many times do l have to say that l don't want a window seat? l'm so sorry. Sorry. Excuse me... l have a fear of flying, l wasn't even aware. Well... Let me see that. l clawed you very badly, l'm so sorry. This is why l don't like to fly. l know that the fearis unfounded, but l'm still scared. l'm so sorry. Brother, this is a safe place. Necmi's place is very close to here. You didn't do anything wrong, brother. You didn't run. You did the right thing. You are not to blame in what has happened. These places are yours, you've probably missed it. Do not leave my side, okay? Go on. Help with the luggage, come on. -Alright, brother. Hasmet! l'm starving, when will you be done? -l'll be down in half an hour. -Alright. Hey, Nick! There's no problem, sir, and we are at Necmi's place now. How's he doing? Good. Don't let him do anything crazy, like coming back here. You are in control there, Turhan. l'm going to be gone for a while. The issue has gone to the police in a different light. Not good. Alright, sir. Don't worry, everything is fine here. Okay then. Hasmet, it's good that you've been sent here. Kemal Aslan. Tarik Aslan. Please make do with these for now, in any case. The Turks here don't know who you are. lf you happen to need anything, call me. You are young men. Do you understand? -Brother?. Are you okay? -l'm fine, l'm fine. Let me see that wound. lt's infected. Don't you ever get bandaged up? -l did it myself in the moming. -Alpago? -Yes, sir. -Give me a pencil and paper. -Of course, sir. Now, you are going to the address written here. lt's our hospital. There won't be anything to do with the police. They should bandage it up properly. What do you have on your hand? Okay, dad, okay. Look, take your medication. You soak yourself from top to bottom while gardening, that's why. Alright. Okay, spoiled daddy. Okay, kisses, don't worry about me, okay? Bye. -Why are you laughing? -No reason. What are you eating? Didn't you bring this? lt was on the counter. l spread it on some bread. -Spit it out! Spit it out, girl, there are walnuts in it! -What? -Spit it out! Who's supposed to be taking care of who? l brought you all the way here. l'm tired. You take me a little ways, honey. You should have written that it had walnuts in it, on it. lf you hadn't jumped on it so fast,... ...l suppose l would have had the time to write on it. l'm all itchy. Who is that? l swear, it's a coincidence. You were walking though. My friend is allergic to walnuts and got poisoned. Hi. What are you doing here? -l came for bandages. -Did l claw you that bad? -Yeah, l almost died. -l'm so sorry. -Just kidding. l had a little accident, that's all... Do you live here? ''This was a question without an answer. The only thing he knew was that to live, he had to be here. But instead of answering,... ...the man preferred to let himself be intoxicated by hersweet voice.'' l neverknew that this pain, Would cause you to stray, And rob me of my heart. Look, she composed this song herself. Very nice, isn't it? l don't know much about this kind of music, but it sounds good. Do you work with music as well? No. l came here to study English. Tourism is a good job where l'm from. But everything changed when l met lrem. My school is over, but l decided to stay fora while longer. My fatherwas a little hard to convince,... ...but that's a separate topic. She was very helpful. Even found me a job. By the way, l'm a hairdresser. Ourshop is up ahead, not too far away. Now, you tell me. -What should l tell? Who is Kemal? l don't know. We've only just met as well. You ran away from something and have come to collect yourself. l get it. How long will you be here, the wise man who sold his Ferrari? -Along time. -How long? For example, three months, a few weeks, a single day? You never know, fate is fate. Good, good. Let him relax a little bit. Yes, sir. -Yourbrothers? -That handsome one is my brother. Different mothers, same father. My mother passed away. His motherraised me, Lady Fadile. Lady Fadile is a good person, l consider herto be my mother. Alpago is like my brother, his father left him to us. l lost my motheras well. But it has been a long time. l can vaguely remember herface. She was a tough woman. My dad is like a flower. But, my mom, you know... l wish l she were here. What happened? Don't look at me like that,... ...l can't look at anyone in the eyes fortoo long. This orthis? The guy will stuff lahmacun in yourmouth. You are going to come home with yourmouth buming. So this shoe, orthis shoe? Put on yourboots and go. How dare you talk about my lord that way? What are you laughing at? Oh, nevermind. You have come to do big things here now, huh? What big things? For example, construction orsomething? Sort of. lt is what it is. Welcome. lt is good that you've come. Look, you are laughing again. Come on, tell me what's so funny, so that l can laugh too. l'm laughing at lrem. She thought you would take me to eat lahmacun. lf she were to see this... We are not at the level of eating lahmacun yet. lf we were eating lahmacun, it would mean that it's over and done. What's overand done? Look, l'm not so great at this romantic stuff. Don't push it. You are such a different man. You are always walking around with a posse. You neversmile. You are like a big sirtype, but at the moment, in front of me... ...you are an embarrassed kid, a five year old child. Look, not smiling still. l want to see yourteeth. Show me. -Wait, it hurts... Stop, it hurts. -Show me yourteeth. -Stop, don't, how shameful! -What's shameful, show me yourteeth. He wants to move faraway, out of the city. l don't know, it hasn't been even been a year. What should l do? Your eyes are like bottomless pits. l'm afraid of falling, but they are drawing me in. With you, it's always the extremes. lt's eitherheaven orhell. Who are you, Kemal? l'm a speck of dust. One winds tossed, carried to the clouds. Mixed with rains, falling onto unknown lands. The prisoner of fate. l'm a speck of dust. Ready for everything. Have you everbeen in love? Not enough to create poetry while looking into a person's eyes. -Did you create this just now? -Don't you like it? So, what about you? -What? -Have you ever been in love? Stop. Don't look at me like that. l can't look at anyone in the eyes fortoo long. Stop! Stop! ''The man was in pain. lt was not because of his wound, it was the pain of having killed. The girl touched his wounds. She didn't care about the reasons. She only cared about one thing.'' Does it hurt a lot? Can l get you some water?. Do you want anything? Hold on. ''Yagmur became the medicine for Hasmet's wounds,... ...it was the beginning of change. He was falling in love. Not just because she was very beautiful, which she was. Hasmet was either changing, orbecoming himself again. To love Yagmurwas... ...to keep away from everything he had lived through. lt was a great opportunity to know himself again. He loved her.'' ''Winter doesn't only tum a city cold,... ...but some of the hearts in it as well.'' What happened? l bumed my finger in the pan, it hurts, it hurts a lot. What are you doing? That feels so good. -The eggs are very good. -Enjoy your meal. Stop eating that, you are nasty, l put my finger in it. What's nasty? Tastes like Kanlica yogurt. Kemal. l miss Turkey. When do we go there? Also, l can't keep hiding you from my fatheranymore. So, tell him. No, not like this. l can't say it overthe phone. lf l go there now, l can break the news about you gently. Then you can meet, then perhaps... First, get my motherto like you, the rest is easy. -Won't she like me? -No, she is slow to like people. lf she wasn't, would l be single now? How many girls have you introduced to herso far?. You are an ass! l miss you so much. l am going to come. l am going to come, but my fearof flying... Okay, dad, kisses, bye. Kemal, aren't we going to go out fordinner?. You are making me eat this disgusting thing. Wait, let me show them how it's done. Are you alright, baby? You feed me this disgusting thing, then you ask me if l'm alright. l can't tell him, mom. Let brother Hamza come and tell him himself. He won't listen to me. He will listen to him. Okay, l'm sending Hamza. Son, you take care of yourself out there. Come on, man, come on. Come on, let's go. Are you sure? Take a few more tests. l finished ten boxes, it's all positive. You fell in love and got pregnant. My dear... Wait, why are you crying? Listen to me. Okay, okay, l got emotional. We met a yearago, today. l bought him a gift. l will tell him when l present it. Girl, you are giving him the best gift there is. l hope he cherishes it. Oh, Tarik is there. Let's talk later, lrem, okay? Kisses. Welcome, Tarik. -Thank you, Yagmur. l got you everything that you wanted. -Thank you. l was talking to lrem just now... l've missed her. Did you hear it? l heard, Yagmur. Tarik, what will happen? Please tell me. Are we going to Turkey? What do we do? l can't tell my dad about this. Yagmur... Mr. Hamza has arrived,... ...they are with my brother at Necmi's place now. Talking. My brother might go to lstanbul. Have the problems been taken care of? Look, Yagmur, don't ask me anything now. Don't say anything to my brother until he retums. lt will be betterto speak when my brother has retumed. Trust me. -But... -Yagmur... Trust me. They know of yourplace here. Sitki has been following you fora few months. Now, they are also aware. The only thing we need to end this conflict... ...is for both sides to show the white flag. We are on the verge of bankruptcy, Hasmet. They are as well. Mr. Resit said, ''if Hasmet retums, we will find a peaceful way''. What is this ''peaceful way'', Hamza? Are they trying to draw us out into the open? No, they are not, trust me. Neitherside has the means to keep this fight going. Brother Necmi, what do you think? Yesterday, l spoke with Lady Fadile. She said, ''if Hasmet retums, it will resolve this mess''. My opinion is that you go. Besides, my guys will be there beside you. l know Resit, he's not like his older brother. The guy is sick anyways. Obviously, he's trying to make things right before he goes. ''She's Pregnant'' l'm fine, l'm fine. Hamza, Yagmur is asking, will you stay overtonight? -No, no. l shouldn't. -Stay. No, l'm going to go and clean up around the place. Good. He won't, baby. l have some good news. We will talk this evening. The captivity ends, huh? Can we leave the girl out of this, Hasmet? -''The girl''? -l mean Yagmur. Ourdestination is certain, the center of the fire. lt's not clearwhat will happen. She doesn't know the customs, orthe people... What is she going to do there? -l know what to do, Hamza. No one knows how to mess things up betterthan him. He says he knows what to do. He should, since he screwed everything up. How can he speak to me like that? What are you mumbling about, Hamza? Aunt, l'm retuming. How was it? l swearto God, l don't know if it went good orif it went bad. This girl will be a nuisance. Hamza, that issue will be handled. Aunt, she's pregnant. Can you hearme, aunt? Hamza, l will not repeat what l said. Aunt, l... She's pregnant, what can l do? Do l need to tell you what to do? Do whatever is necessary. We had met on this day, last year. l hurt this hand. This is an apology addressed from this hand, to this one. But this is not a simple watch. lt's very nice. We are leaving. Don't scream, stop. Are you serious? Things worked out, but first, l have to go to Turkey alone. Look, when l retum, everything will have changed. What if you don't retum? Take me with you, please. l will go crazy here without you. Don't worry, Tarik will be here. He will not leave you alone. l have to go. When l come back, l will have solved everything. Then, we will go together. You are coming back, aren't you? Will you be my wife? Yes. When you get back, l will have a surprise for you. -Welcome, Mr. Hasmet. -Hello. -Brother, welcome. -My dearsister! Did you miss me? -How can l not miss my brother? -Ask me about it. Where is mom? -lnside, waiting for you. Come on. l'm your mothertoo. My heart hurts for you when something happens,... ...just as if it had happened to Turhan. Only God knows what l had to endure here forthe past year. There is no otherway. This is your responsibility. Only you can handle this situation. l don't have it in me, nor does this family... ...to lift anotherfuneral from this house. Hasmet, they know where you are staying there. lf you care about this family... ...and what your late father entrusted to you,... ...you will do it. Where is Hamza? At ourhometown. From there, he is organizing the attendees. He will be here on the day of the meeting. -Yagmur? -Tarik. -Tarik, where are we? -lt's a surprise, Yagmur. Asurprise. -lt's Kemal. -Yagmur, give me the phone. Look, you are going to mess up the whole surprise. Come on. Hamza? Tarik, what's going on? Sit down. Do you know who it is that you are with? What does that mean, Hamza? lt means, the fairy tale is over now. Now come the facts. His name is Hasmet. Hasmet Ayaz. Before he came here,... ...he killed the head of one of Turkey's most dangerous families. He killed Mr. lhsan. That is why he has been here for a year. What did he tell you about his wounds? This is the shootout where he was injured. They wanted to get things done themselves. That's why, this issue was reflected differently to the police. Both families have had many funerals. Finally, through my efforts, we came to an agreement. lf this agreement goes through,... ...it ends the rage that's been going on formany years. Both families will be able to avoid bankruptcy. Here's the only one obstacle in theirway: You. Who, me? To get rid of you, both families will do everything they can. They know where Hasmet is hiding here. They know about you as well. There is no othersolution, you must leave Hasmet. l don't believe you, let him tell me himself. When he retums, he will tell you the same. What l'm saying is, no matterwhat he tells you,... ...you shouldn't go back to Turkey with him. -l'm pregnant. -Yes, we know. lt would be much easier if you weren't,... ...but we will take care of that, don't worry. What do you mean, you will take care of it? What do you mean, you will take care of it? Let's get you off to this side, the doctorwill take care of it. Let go, let go! What are you doing? Let go! What are you doing? Tarik! Tarik, help me, please! -Brother Hamza! -l don't think you understand me! l said there is a blood feud, Hasmet will die. This is not a joke. l don't make jokes. Now, get rid of that bastard and go away, or l will kill you! Brother... l'm going to the airport. When this is done, take herback to where you picked her up. Explain to herwhat she should do very carefully. What we are doing is wrong. So, all what's been done to date is alright, but this is wrong. Come on, Turhan, come on, do as you are told. This is illegal. Yagmur! From the day l lost my brother, a part of me has been gone as well. Another death... ...will disturb me in my grave. Turhan is young. Sitki... You... Hamza... lt would be a pity. Some of you are in the soil, a bunch of you are in prison. The young will control theirtempers. There is a blessing in a wedding. This so-called peace should not just be said in words. Through marriage, the blood feud will stop. Marry ourdaughter, Nupelda. Then, we will become relatives. The hundreds of members of this family will only allow as such. Nupe, she grew up on the same streets as you. She knows you. We asked her. We received her approval. lt was voluntary. Let this rage end. Provide us with grandkids. Nothing else will douse this fire. Now, if there is anyone against this marriage, let them leave here now. l don't need your permission! What's this supposed to mean? l'll nevertrust you, Hasmet! Hasmet! Be wise! Everybody should be wise. ''Hasmet was the man she loved since childhood. The woman thought: 'Who am l looking at?' Was it herhusband,... ...or herfather's killer?'' What are you doing? You are trying to add fuel to a fire we are trying to put out. All of the efforts we had to put in just to get it to this point... What do you want, Turhan to be killed? Should they just shoot you again? Do you want to lose everything yourfatherleft behind? Tell them to wait for my answer. You don't need to go. l told Turhan, he told Yagmureverything. Hamza... Hamza... Hamza, what did you do? She's looking at us. l heard she escaped, why didn't you tell me? Calm down, listen. ''Calm down''? What do you mean, ''calm down''? She fled, but had an accident while fleeing. Kemal... She had a miscarriage. That's God work for you. You see? He didn't will it either. You are sure, right? The doctor just left. The girl is miserable. She had a miscarriage. Hamza, food is ready. Good. Look, Hasmet is on his way there. Now, the rest is up to you. That girl will not come here. Alright. Why? They want him to marry the daughterof the man he killed. My brotherhas to do it. This blood feud is to be eliminated through a wedding. The situation is very serious. You have to go. lf you won't think about yourself, think about my brother. This is no joke, they will kill him. lf my brothercomes here, sees you,... ...he won't let go when he finds out about the baby. He will endanger both his life and yours. Yagmur, if you love my brother, stay away from him. He proposed to me. There is no otherchoice, Yagmur. lf you love my brother, leave. Go, Yagmur. lf you love my brother. Yagmur! Yagmur! Where is she? -She's gone. Where did she go? Hamza said to tell her, so l told her. She took her belongings and took off. l couldn't stop her. What do you mean you couldn't stop her? Hamza told me that you knew, and so l told her. What should l have done? Why do you have her phone? She forgot it on herway out, on the table. Get out of here! ''That powerful man was crying in the middle of the city. The burdens that he thought he had left behind... ...were, again, riding on his shoulders,... ...more severe and more cruel this time.'' l nevertrusted that man in the first place. Yagmur, my baby... No way, no way will he everfind you again. God damn him. Don't curse him. He doesn't even know about it. -Look at you... -lrem, what do l do now? ls this the point they have brought you to? Were you like this before? Let him go on looking for you. Kemal is such a jerk! What, so his name was Hasmet... The man is a complete fraud. What happened? What's going on? lrem, is he here? Hello, lrem. Yagmurand l have been going through some things. l can't find her. l thought she would be here. Look, it wasn't my fault. There's something l need to tell her. lf she's here, let me just talk to her. Come with me. Look, Kemal, orwhoever you are. She's a strangerto yourworld. She sees these things only from watching TVand movies. l think you should stop chasing her. Leave the girl and us alone. -Yagmur? -Kemal, stop. -Let go. -Kemal, l said ''stop''. -Let me go, lrem. -Kemal, no. -Hey! -Yagmur! lrem, get off me! -l said ''no''! Yagmur! Yagmur! Yagmur! Kemal... Kemal! You know, he was deported, he can't go back. But he may ask you to help. Necmi. Keep that girl away from Hasmet. Don't worry, Lady Fadile, l am aware of the seriousness of the situation. He called me already, l'll handle it. You saw them there. A blonde, huh? Was she pretty? Pathetic, compared to you. Ah, Nupe... You think l would have been that quiet if you weren't there, huh? l would have killed all of them. That man shot my father, he died in my arms. Now, l call ourfather's killer my brother-in-law, huh? Anyways, l won't say anything. But just so you know this, sister, l will always be alert. l won't accept it. l can't. Not a sound from you, Sitki. You won't make a single sound until l tell you. You will bear it until l say so. Of course l'm sorry forwhat has happened. As l said, l found the girl. l was kicked out. Unspeakable remarks were made. You know that other girl, the girl that's with her... They relocated to Canada. Never mind now, nevermind. Look, things are working out overthere. Don't go raising this topic. Okay, Necmi, okay. Thank you. Hush. Hush, don't bark. Our girl has come. Ourgirl... My daughter, Yagmur. When did you get here? Why didn't you let me know? Since when have you been sitting there? Daddy, l've missed you so much. My dear, my dear, don't cry, my baby. ''She was weak and desperate. She was taking on sorrows she had never known. She tried, but she couldn't do it. She couldn't end the baby's life. Perhaps, giving birth would be just the thing... ...to save herfrom this situation she felt powerless over,... ...so the woman thought. As the rain poured overher.'' Did you notice, did you see how the garden has expanded? l'll talk to the mayor and get that wall demolished as well. Then, this will be a huge place. When you get married, we can have the wedding here. Since we will have a big garden. My dear, my beautiful girl. Only if yourmotherwas alive and could have seen you all grown up... She would have been dancing at yourwedding with me. She would take her grandchild into herarms,... ...and shout at us like she used to. She would say ''be quiet''. l miss taking heron when she was angry. Dad, l'm pregnant. Pregnant? Dad, we were going to get married. But please don't ask about it, l can't tell you. Yesterday, l went to get an abortion, but l couldn't do it. l feel it in my tummy, dad. Dad. ''His daughter's baby and the facts she could not speak of... ...were a bit too much for a father... ...who was just trying to improve his garden. Neitherthis town, or his heart, was a place able to understand it.'' The first kiss with you... The first time being with you... l always imagined doing these things forthe first time with you. There is someone else on your mind, l know. l heard she's a blonde girl. But l'm yourwoman now, Hasmet. Nupelda... Will you be able to love me? ls that necessary? Dad? Dad, won't you talk to me? l need you to trust me, dad. l can't tell you. You are carrying the child of a man who l don't even know. You come home, then say ''trust me''. How can l face the people in this town? You neverthink that. When l go to yourmother's grave, how do l explain this to her? What do l tell that child? How can l hold it? You neverthink. But you can stand before me and say ''trust me''. Don't trust me, girl. Don't trust me. l will not take care of that child in this house. l will not call it my grandchild. lf you want to give birth to that child, do it elsewhere. And from now on, don't call me ''dad''. -Dad, come on, please. -l said ''don't call me dad''! Yourdaughter's got a bun in the oven. Where's the groom? Won't he make an appearance? He's a soldier, a soldier. When he comes back from the army. What should l do now, woman? l can't discard it, l can't put it off, l can't kick her out... Should l kill myself, should l kill her, what do l do? You will forgive me, dad. l am your daughter, and this is yourgrandchild. l broke your heart, l know. But my heart is broken too. l fell in love, dad! lt was not with just some random guy! Don't speak! Don't tell me, tell yourmom! Let's see if she will forgive you! lf yourmotherwas alive now,... ...she would have caved your head in with a stone! Cave my head in then, dad. You can do it too. Go, girl, leave! Donat make me kill my own child! lf you will not forgive me, then kill me! l give you my blessing! Eitherkill me orforgive me, dad! Let God forgive you, my daughter. l will not take that kid on my lap, do you understand? l will not take that kid on my lap! Yagmur... Yagmur! Yagmur! -Dad! My girl! ls anybody there? Hang on, girl, hang on. Call a doctor, run, run! Hold on, dear, there is a doctorcoming, hold on. Woman, what do l do now? Kemal! Unfortunately, these results are negative too, Mrs. Nupelda. But there are new techniques developing every day. There are a few more methods l would like to offeras treatment for you. lf you let me, we can start a new treatment. You are coming to the meeting. Pick yourself up a little. lt didn't work this time either. But we'll try again with anothermethod. l want to give you a child so much. ''ln the mirror, she only saw someone... ...who is trying to be a woman with herdamaged femininity. She felt incomplete.'' To get this hotel back will be too tiring forus at the moment. We have neitherthe personnel northe time to deal with this thing. We are here forsentimental reasons. This hotel has been run by this family for overtwenty years. We know how valuable it is. Think about my offer, and get back to me. Yes, Mr. Hasmet. Wait a minute, wait a minute. This business will end here today. That's what we are here for, Mrs. Nupelda. That's exactly what we are doing. No. Yourgoal is to take advantage of ourweaknesses,... ...and sell off the hotel to us at an exorbitant price. lf you were sitting in front of my uncle,... ...he would have ripped yourtongue out of yourhead. l miss you so much. Hasmet! lf you evertry to undermine my authority again, l'll kill you. You are the one letting them undermine yourauthority. You let them spit on ourfamily values. lt was a bluff. They will get back to us within two days. They can't sell it to anyone but us, and you know it. Do you know why we can't have kids? Because you can't get that bimbo out of yourmind. Show them the masculinity you are not showing me,... ...so that we can get back what this family has lost. Don't make me. l know, you will love it. You saw nothing but this while growing up. But don't force me to do it. No more of this. No more of this! Sir, your phone... ''Alpago: l Found Her'' Yagmur, there's someone here, asking for you. Why didn't you listen to me? l've been looking for you formonths. Zeynep, don't leave, you can stay. There was nothing to listen to. You were going t get married. What should l have done, become your mistress? l don't know why you are here. But you'd bettergo. My husband will retum soon. Yagmur?. Yagmur! Okay, calm down. How's it going? l can't talk right now. l see, you still haven't finished it. Don't let me disturb you. Don't forget about the engagement rehearsal tomorrow. Alright. l'll call you. ''Hasmet was watching the lives of the people... ...that were built on his unhappiness. He stopped questioning. He just watched.'' Brother, come on. These monsters finished all the meat. Come on, come here. Alpago. -Yes, sir? Wow, brother... Can you believe that Turhan has a child, and we got to see it? How time flies, doesn't it? lt would have been nice to see your kid... -What happened to youreye? -My eye? ls it Hamza? Oh, brother... Where's Nupe? Why isn't she coming down? She has the flu, she's not coming down... ...because she doesn't want to infect the children. They are bringing their children here on purpose. Trying to send me a message. l'm suffering more than you are. Some nights, you kiss me in a way that... l know it's not me on your mind at that moment. You kiss that bimbo. -Nupe... Look, Hasmet, l will let you think about hertonight. Come on, let's do it. You don't love me, l know. Think of the woman that you do love. Let me give you a child, please. Please? Don't run away! What is this obsession you have? Why can't you save yourself? Give it to me. Nupe, give it to me. ''She could not reach the man she loved. The walls that needed to be taken down were too tiring for Nupelda. As Hasmet tried to live the life that was imposed on him,... ...he could not escape his fate. Aword, a sound, or a song would take him back to her. Every time...'' ''Pain... He felt the pain down to his bones. The fire would not go out. Time is medicine, but could it extinguishing this flame?'' Run, get overhere. Come here, come here. Look, why am l here, do you know? l'm going to lstanbul. l will participate in a conference forthree days. l would like for you to come too. -No, l can't leave my father.

You can stay down here, l'lljoin you shortly. No, l'm fine, l'm fine. l just need a little time alone. Okay, talk to you later, Sinan. Every breath l took after you, was not like breathing. l lost all of my soul along with you. l've never loved any otherwoman but you, Yagmur. ls he ourson? Yes. Why didn't you tell me? Why have you dragged me through hell for all these years? They told me not to say anything. -Who? -Hamza and yourbrother. They tried to get me to have an abortion. Hamza said ''have this child, and we are all going to die''. They said they would kill you if l didn't stay away. l was afraid of something happening to you. All of them will have to answerto me. lt wasn't easy to raise him. l always lived on the edge. Afraid that somebody would try to take my child away from me. l want forhim... ...to have a different kind of world than the world you have. Please, let us go. That's not possible. lt's no longer possible. Mom, where are you? Mom, can we go to the pool with Uncle Sinan? -ls yourname Kemal? -Yes. My name is Kemal too. Nice to meet you.

Mom, can we go? -Of course, my love. lt was nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Kemal, come on, let's go down to the pool. You did a great job raising him. Without him, l couldn't have gone on with anything. Every day without you was like hell. His presence has lessened my pain. l promise you, from now on, it's you, me, and ourson. l don't care about the rest. -But you are married... -You two are my family. Please don't disappear again. Give me a chance to fix everything. You grew within me from day to day. So, this was the reason. l felt it. You haven't forgotten me. ls it possible to forget you? We have a son who has youreyes. Today, l will send you to a place. No one knows it but me. l will take care of everything, and a few days later, l willjoin you. l don't want you to endanger yourself, Kemal. He has grown accustomed to being fatherless. Please don't take this away from me. l have a right to it. l grew up without a father. Give me a chance to raise him the way l was neverraised. Please. What's up, you've called 50 times since this moming. l hope there's nothing wrong. l'm at the hotel. Be here in an hour. Mom, l'm sleepy. Alright, my love, you can sleep on the way now. Come here, you, come here! What did you do? -What are you saying? You moron! Didn't you say she had a miscarriage? Wasn't she supposed to nevertum up again? That's what she told me. -Should l kill you now, God damn... -Hamza! Have you gotten big enough to be able to come to our home and harass us? Yourson bumed us. Yourstep-son is digging the graves for both Turhan and himself. Mom, the girl said ''l will stay away from your brother''. She's there! She gave birth to the kid. l saw them with my own eyes! Do you realize what sort of a fire you have cast us all into? He will take woman and the kid and disappear. Lady Fadile, whateverhappens afterthat, will happen to us! l give up. Hamza? Get yourthings packed. l don't understand. l'll pick you up in an hour. Transferall the bank accounts within an hour. Come to where l tell you to come when l call. Are we really going finally? We are going halfway around the world, away from all this crap. l'll call you. What are you doing here? Hamza, where are you going? l'm not the dog of this house Hamza. l'm yourwife! l said, ''where are you going''! You haven't been around forseveral days already. You are running away with that bankerwoman, aren't you? Get off my back! Call the hospital! She has a broken neck and is in serious condition. We are trying to keep her alive, but herlife will neverbe the same. l had to do it, or l would have lost all of you. You spared yourown son, but tried to kill mine. -Brother! -Turhan. -Brother, forgive me! -Shut up, boy. Brother! So, l'm the guilty one, huh? There are thousands of men... ...who are eaming theirbread money due to this marriage. Now these people will cry out forblood. Starting with Sitki! l didn't shoot Mr. lhsan. l'm not going down for it. You didn't come with me, you weren't there. You don't know what happened. -l told you not to go! Whatever happened, happened, Hasmet. We grew up like brothers, you and l. l've always tried to protect you, but you know this world as well as l do. They will not forget about blood. There is no escape from this. lf you hadn't shot that man, l'd already be long gone! l stayed to protect you. The bank called. You tried to empty youraccounts. You didn't go because business was slow. You didn't have any money to take with you. You were going to profit from this marriage too. You waited. Hamza, you tried to kill my son. You left my sisterfor dead. You know that you can't escape this. They won't let you live. l know. -l was very worried about you. -Here l am. Look at what ourguys brought me from the security room. Sitki, are you sure? ls it her? l'm sure, my sister, l'm sure. l also looked at the hotel records. Her name is Yagmur. This is the girl. Today is my day. Shall l use my voice now? Do l have yourpermission? lt's like everything's fine, like... ...l've gone on vacation to a summer house with you and our child. l wish that were true. l could neverlive my own life. For me, the realest moment is this moment. Alpago. -Yes, sir? -Prepare the barbecue. -Sure. What will happen now? l have to go. You will wait for me here. lf l don't come back until tomorrow night,... ...the guys will take you from here. Don't go. We can go to another part of the world. Aplace they can't find us... We can establish new lives. Please, Kemal, l can't bearto lose you again. Please. Sir. God loves the patient ones. Of course, my heart is good. That day will come, l said to myself, l've been patient. God has granted me a part of my prayers, Hasmet. Look, if you noticed, l said ''part of my prayers''. Because l have Turhan at gunpoint. lf it were you instead, then it would be complete. -Alpago, get the car. -Of course. Kemal, l beg of you, don't go. Please, please. l have to go. lf you want me to come back to you as Kemal,... ...l have to leave Hasmet with them. You are the only woman l've everloved. Don't you everforget that. Don't go. -Alpago, take Turhan away. -No. Keep your anger inside. Don't do anything crazy. Alpago, there is no end to this. Come on, take Turhan and get out of here. -Allow me, let me kill them all. -Come on, come on. There is no end to it. Come on, champ. Take Turhan and get out of here, come on. Let them go. Let us speak alone. -Sitki, leave us alone. -Sister! Sitki, get out! lt didn't have to be this way. l'd have given anything for you. l tried so hard. But you broke the agreement between us, Hasmet. You made a toy out of my dignity. You played with my sense of femininity. You humiliated me towards my family. l have a son with her. He is a part of me. Alright. l accept. Bring the child,... ...but leave that bimbo out of our lives. Set out a new life for yourself. l have worked very hard to cool this fire. Like you, l have sacrificed myself. But it didn't work, the flames didn't die out. Don't go. For God's sake, don't go. lf you stay with me, l'll protect you. No one can hurt you while you're by my side. lf l leave here, they will shoot me, right? Yes. Well, if l die, does that stop the bloodshed? Don't do it, Hasmet. Nupelda, if l die, will this warstop? -Put down the gun. -Nupe, will the blood feud stop? Sister! No more talking, shoot him! That is ourfather's killer, standing in front of you! lf you don't shoot, l'm going to! -l said ''leave us alone'', Sitki! He's trying to deceive you! He's trying to trick you! l will not be able to rest until l have bled this bastard out! l beg you, stay with me. l beg you. Come on, sister, shoot! l neverknew that this pain would cause you to stray... ...and rob me of my heart. ls this the ring? Yes. l neverknew that this pain, Would cause you to stray, And rob me of my heart. l never knew that l had Rains and blood inside. l never knew that What l had the most, Would have to settle for What l don't have. That the farthest Would become the closest, And that the closest Would then be lost to me. l never knew. l never knew. l never knew. l never knew. Are you mad at me, My one and only? lf you are, it's been too long, Just so you know. Bumt-scented winds hit my face. My shivering is Keeping me from breathing. Hesitant words are Stuck in my throat. They took the nearest right tum And parked themselves. They were disobedient words. They say loving is a secret by name. Noisy letters are becoming silent. They are leaving Their most intimate feelings behind. Are you not tired of my voice, My silent scream? Your place is within my mess. Let's tum it into a dream.
