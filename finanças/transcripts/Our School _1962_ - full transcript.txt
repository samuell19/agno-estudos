PRINCIPAL: Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name. ALL: Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done, in Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, forever and ever, amen. "Grant, Lord, that what we have said with our lips, "we may believe in our hearts and practise in our lives." ALL: Amen. Hurry up, get to your places. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning, David. (STUDENTS CHATTERING) TEACHER: Come on, get a move on. Right, sit down and get your homework out. TEACHER: All right, back to your seats, sit down. Will you give those out for me, Brenda, please? Katy, give those out, will you? (INDISTINCT) Don't throw them, Brenda! That's a good girl. - (INDISTINCT) - TEACHER: All right, thank you. Peter, why wasn't your book handed in? I did give my book in, miss. You've marked it. No, not you, the other Peter. Peter, why didn't you give your book in? I forgot, miss. - TEACHER: You forgot? - (STUDENTS CHUCKLE) All right, Peter. Well, I will correct it for you. But you've lost your marks for it. You know that, don't you? (INDISTINCT) All right, may I have your attention, please? Now, on the whole, this piece homework was well done by most of you. But I have got one or two old complaints to make. You are still making mistakes in spelling and punctuation. Some of you don't yet know where to put an apostrophe. On the word, "Go", up and down the wall bars twice. Two backward rolls. Touch each of the four walls. Ready, go! Have a look through the glasses there. You can see better than I can at the moment. Exactly what's happening in the joint there. Just watch carefully at what he's doing there, because you've got to have a go at this in a minute, remember? I think it's melting through, sir. Look, hold it like this. Don't be afraid of the spark. Make those lines a little lighter, lad. I think you could have done a little more than this by now. Yes, sir. Well, I did this part wrong, sir. So, I had to rub it out and do it again. I see. (INAUDIBLE) Oh, these onions! You got a handkerchief? No, use your apron. - Where were you sitting last week? - Down there, madam. Well, go there, then. Now, much thinner than that, Min. - Yes, madam. - That's better. Little bit more. (GIRLS CHATTERING) Oh, come on, you two. Now, where's your fork? Stick it in. That's better. Now, what are you going to do next? - I don't know. - Come on, Heather. That's all right, run it out. That's all right. Is it supposed to be much bigger than that? Um, yes. Make it nice and round. That's right. Roll it gently. You're not driving a steamroller. Is this a circle? - Would you call that a circle? - Yes. (GIRL LAUGHING) - Does it look like a circle to you? - I can't make mine into a circle. Look, that's it. Brush it with egg and don't forget your two holes at the top. Got that, right? Don't press it down. All right? And the end is up at the other end of the row. Madam, is this round... Don't walk about with your pastry around the room. (SIGHS) Miss Terry, it won't stick. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Now, those of you who'll be taught to make the vats, in which we deposit a very thin shell of copper, onto a prepared copper base. Here you see the layout of the vat before the solution is pumped in. Does anybody know what solution we use for copper plating? - Yes? - Copper sulphite. That's good. We also use sulphuric acid. Sir, why do you add the acid? It acts as a conductor for your electrodes. Now, here you see a typical layout of a depositing vat. There are nine copper plate anodes. Three at each side and three along the bottom. When the solution is pumped in, we pick up current through this brush gear and we transfer it onto the copper cylinder, which is revolving in the solution. We can set up a similar arrangement to this in the lab at school. We would need a beaker of copper sulphite, a copper plate, and a clean piece of metal to be plated. TEACHER: We've talked about the way she uses words. But what is this story really about? John, what do you think? It talks about the farmer and the farmer's wife, and the hands on the farm, trying to stop the main swarm of locust settling on the farm. But is that what it's really about? Linda? Well, how the people react to such a disaster. And how Margaret tries to prove that's she's not just only a town girl, that she's, sort of, equipping herself for the farm. TEACHER: Roslyn, what do you think? Well, I think Doris Lessing is trying to tell us that you can't crush man's spirit. He's got to go on living whatever may happen. He'll still live. He may not be the same, after, say, a disaster happens. But he'll still go on living, whatever happens in life... So quiet, I thought the room was empty. (STUDENTS CHUCKLE) - Do ask them to sit down, please. - Sit down again, will you? PRINCIPAL: I thought you'd like it back straight away. I'll have a word with you about it later on. Oh, thank you very much. - What are we doing? - TEACHER: Story by Doris Lessing. PRINCIPAL: Oh, that's an nice change from set books anyway. (DOOR CLOSING) Sometimes when we read set books for exam, it makes reading seem dull and boring. I want you to pass your GCE, you know I do. But much more than that, I want you to be able to distinguish between good and bad writing. Well, it'll need a little bit of balance, won't it? But it depends what you're going to do with this chap. If he's coming out of the door, coming out this way, and... - He's coming out... - Coming straight at you? (STUDENTS LAUGHING) You seem to be finding some difficulty in speaking, Keith. - What were you eating? - Chewing gum, sir. Will you kindly remove it? And don't stick it under the table. (ALL LAUGHING) Would any of you be prepared to change your way of speaking in order to keep your friends? - John. - Yes, sir. Definitely. Why do you say "definitely"? Well, I feel our place, where I go around with some boys I know, and they talk relaxed-like. You know, how they been used to talking. Like slang, really. And I just feel out of place. And you said, "Relaxed-like"? And, "You know"? Why "like"? "Like" what? Why do you use that expression? What does it mean? I mean... Well, I actually mean relaxed. - Yes, without the... - Like. Well, why do you use it? Don't know, just came out. TEACHER: Ginetta? I don't think it's worth degrading yourself to be on the same level as your friends. TEACHER: Vernon? Well, you can speak slovenly when you're with your friends and correctly when you're out somewhere important. You don't think there are any dangers involved in that? Not if you master the art, no, sir. Don't you think that your speaking well might eventually have a good effect upon them? Why not you pull them up rather than they drag you down? I think speech is just like a quicksand. It just drags down, it doesn't push up. You mean bad speech, Vernon. But it's a good analogy. And if any of you people don't know the meaning of this word analogy, you know what to do, look it up in a dictionary. Eileen, what do you feel about this business of speaking well? If, um, I could speak a little better than my parents, which really wouldn't be surprising, as both my parents, um, are very... (CHUCKLES) They come from London. They've both got cockney-type accents. If we had visitors, I should think I should feel very embarrassed if I could speak better than my mother and father because, really, I mean, you look to you mother and father to be better than you are. I think you are confusing speaking well with having an accent, Eileen. And I'm not here to get you to speak in an affected way. One can have an accent and still speak well. I have an accent, for example, but I still try to speak well. Now, Michael, would you agree? Well, I think that you should speak as naturally as you can, and not put on some posh accent. But it's nothing to do with having a posh accent. Nothing whatever! It's a matter of speaking plainly, clearly and concisely, and with the best possible vocabulary. Now, look, this is the sort of scene you might have found when you went into London in medieval times. What do you... What are they doing, do you think, Christine? Now, right of the man is a bear, and the bear's dancing. Yes, what do we call those people? Um, jugglers. They're jugglers. And what is the whole scene? Where are they doing their juggling, Christine? In the marketplace. In the marketplace, yes, you've got that fairly clearly. Terry. Stop looking at Bernard. What about a more serious side of the market? - What else might be in the market? - Well, like, um... TEACHER: What happens in our market? Well, they sell vegetables in our market, miss. Do you think they might in the Middle Ages? Yes, miss. - What else do you think they might sell? - What, miss? Oh, um... - Lettuce, miss, I think. - Yes, probably. And they might have some dancing girls or something in the street, miss. Cor! TEACHER: Not those sort of dancing girls, Bernard. (STUDENTS LAUGH) Well, now, wait a minute. Take a breath. Don't rush it, say it properly. What do you think they might be selling? They might sell, let's say, some banjos. - We||... - We||, they do sell banjos. (MIMICKING BANJO PLAYING) A sort of banjo they used in the Middle Ages. All right. What else do you think they might sell? They might sell some pieces of crockery. Crockery, pottery, yes. - What do you think they might... - A bunch of forks? They might even sell animals. Animals. Yes, they're much more likely to have sold animals in the market. A soldier or two might come along and pinch something off the store. And the store man might pinch something off the soldier? Do you think that would be likely to happen in the Middle Ages? - Yes. - Why do you think that sort of thing... People were cruel. - Because they were cruel. What else? - Yeah. Well, they were mean, and ugly. TEACHER: What else goes on in a market? Please, miss. There's another thing, miss There's these big heavy bottles, miss. And you pay six pence, and you get three balls, miss. And you have to knock all these bottles down, miss. There's three at the bottom, then two at the top, then there's one. And you have to try and chuck them and hit them all down, miss. But you're not about to chuck them out, miss. 'Cause they're a solid group nearly, miss. The fair people make it very, very difficult for you. - BOY: skittle. - Hmm. Right. Well, now the bell's gone. And we really ought to get on with some math’s. Could we do it in the next, miss? Well, no, that's just what I'm trying to say to you. STUDENTS: Oh, miss! TEACHER: I think we've got so far with this, that I want to you to do some work on it now. We've spent near a whole lesson talking... Now, be quiet. Nearly a whole lesson talking, and that's a good thing. You've remembered a lot about medieval times, of the things that go on. And I want you to carry on now with your pilgrim books. - Now, don't start... - Can I go to the bathroom, miss? Listen first. Now listen. First of all, I want to you to write three or four lines, telling me what your picture is going to be, what it is going to be about. And then, on this page, the whole of this page is to be the picture, the first scene that your pilgrims see. It can be the beginning of the story or the first thing they saw when they got to their first big town. All right, do you all understand what you have to do? Now, Terry, you can come and get these and take them around, please. While you're working, you may talk quietly. But it must be quietly because I want to talk to some of you about your homework. Sit down here. I want to talk about your homework. Now, look, this was jolly good. I've given you a star for it. But there's one or two things I want you to sort out for me. (INAUDIBLE) Robert, get on with your work. I want to see something at the end of the lesson. Christine. So watch that one. And this is one... And a lot of you got this word wrong. You must try and remember it, I told you lots of times. People. Now, Bernard, tell them how to spell "people". - P-E-O-P-L-E. - Yes. Yes, you learnt it from the last time I told you. I know, but I did give you all a talking to about it the other day. And you must remember it. Too many of you spell people with P-E-E-P-L-E. Not necessary. All right. Carry on. (INDISTINCT) (ALL CHATTERING) All right. Listen. Now stop talking. By the way, who made the decision that you leave school at fifteen? - ALL: I did. - Me mum. TEACHER: Well, now, Susan. Well, my mum and dad asked me, do I want to stay. And I said, "I want to leave". And they said, "it's up to you". TEACHER: Just like that? They didn't mind at all? (STUDENTS CHATTERING) And how many of you discuss these things with you parents? ALL: No one. TEACHER: All right, now one at a time. Maureen, do you discuss things with your parents? Yes, some things I do. TEACHER: With both parents? No, I didn't with my father, I did with me mum, though. Did she want you to leave? Yes, she did want me to leave. - TEACHER: And you're leaving at? - Christmas. - And you wanted to leave? - Yes, miss. TEACHER: What are you going to do? I'm thinking of working in shop work. I started by asking you what you felt about marriage. (INDISTINCT) Jennifer. - Yes, miss? - Do you want to get married? Yes, miss. - What are your reasons? - Settle down and have children. TEACHER: "Settling down?" I keep on hearing this phrase. Now, what do you mean by "settling down"? (STUDENTS CHATTERING) - We||, um... - Yes, Carol? When you get married, it stops your happy-go-life, don't it? I mean, you can't go to dances and much when you are married, really, can you? - You can. - You can't! ALL: You can! It stands to reason that if you've got children, then you've got to get a baby-sitter. And, I mean, you've got to pay for that baby-sitter you've got to pay for the money to go to the dance. I mean, you can't afford all of it. (INDISTINCT ARGUING) TEACHER: Now stop arguing amongst yourselves. What do you get married for? (INDISTINCT) All right. Well, let's have one at a time. Carol, what did you say? To make a home, miss. Linda, what do you want out of marriage? Hmm. Just a house of our own and a car. What do you think you'll be able to give to your marriage? Were these after dancing lessons, the refreshments? (STUDENTS SNICKERING) - Come on, then. - And I went to bingo. All right, bingo. How much did you spend on that? Um, three and six. Did you win anything? - Yes, sir. - Shouldn't that go on this side? That was in, wasn't it? What were the winnings? Bottle of port. (ALL LAUGHING) Well, we can't very well... We can't very well... Well, but I think we will, yes. One bottle of port, yes? How much do you think that was worth? - Oh, about a pound. - Pound! All right. I'll put that in brackets. I know this isn't very good accounting, but we might as well get everything in. Come on. And, uh, three shillings in saving stamps. Savings. Three shillings. Any more? And six and six on a birthday present. TEACHER: Whose present? GIRL: A friend's. - Your friend's. - BOY: It's her boyfriend! (ALL LAUGHING) TEACHER: Well, never mind if it was. That's all, is it? What does all this add up to? Hurry UP- 16 and 10. 16 and 10? Well, that doesn't add up to 10 pence, does it? - Oh, the bus fares, 10 pence. - 10 pence. Well, that still doesn't make 16 and 10. - Oh, and I've left out... - You are the pest! Come on. What else have you left out? - Some chips and lemonade. - Oh, yes! Chips and lemonade. (STUDENTS CHATTERING AND LAUGHING) Were these after the, um... - BOY: The port! - That's the port, is it? No! How much? - GIRL: One and six. - One and six. Now we've got our 10 pence. All right, what's the rest, 16 shillings? Now we've heard a rather lot from you. John, how much money do you get? Um, pocket money, I've got seven and six. Seven and six. Anything else? JOHN: Wages from the paper around. - Yes, how much? - 10 shillings. Now, on the other side, what should we have? The pictures. Eight shillings. TEACHER: Oh! (STUDENTS LAUGHING) Rather expensive seats, were they? Or did you take up several? Well? - Hmm? - I had a bit of fun afterwards, sir. (STUDENTS LAUGHING) Come on, John. Money in the bank. Four and six. Are you saving up for anything special? I'm going on a trip to Liechtenstein next year. - Are you? - Yeah. - You've done that before, haven't you? - Yes, went two years ago. How much have you got to fly into there? 15 pounds, 10. TEACHER: Hmm. - Anything else? - No, that's the lot. That's the lot. All right. Now, we've had a bit of amusement out of these accounts. But you must realise there's something more serious to them, and we're coming on to that in the next few lessons. But meanwhile, we haven't marked all your homework. So, will you take out your pencils. I don't want any forgeries. And here are the answers. - You all ready? - ALL: Yes. Quite sure? Right, number one... NARRATOR: This secondary school is three schools in one, and it's still very new. It has new buildings, new equipment. Fresh techniques in teaching. A freer, friendlier atmosphere in the bright classrooms. All conspicuous advances for a better education. But no advances are substitute for hard work. The pen, the pencil, the exercise book. Hunched shoulders over a desk remain unchanged through the years of transformation. There is no quick, no ready-made, no instant knowledge that can be swallowed. It needs time to grow. It needs to be nourished by the responsible teacher. Someone who each day involves himself in the lives of every young person in his care. During school hours, and after, when he gives his time. So that others may /earn to enjoy their leisure. GIRL: ls the rehearsal tonight, sir? Is there tonight... Yes, there is, 4:00. All right, don't be late. (INDISTINCT) (EXCLAIMING) (INDISTINCT) (GIRLS SINGING INDISTINCTLY) NARRATOR: There are parents and teachers. All too ready to label the young as flippant, lazy, rude, selfish, and more. Perhaps too many of us have forgotten what it feels like to grow up, to be a young person and stranded somewhere between the child and the adult world. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (INAUDIBLE) Even in the school world there are particular difficulties. To be eleven in the junior school is to be old. To be eleven in the senior school is to be very young. And when you're fifteen at the top of the school, and have the authority of a prefect, previous friendships can come to an abrupt end, and divided loyalties bring a sharp pain. And when you leave school to start work, you go from the top to the bottom once more. (MACHINERY CLATTERING) (INAUDIBLE) People talk glibly about secondary schools, but each school is different. Each teacher is different. Each child is different. A school is like a family, with all that that implies. It has its own pride and its prejudice. It can, like some parents, regard itself as very enlightened. Or it can try to keep up with the neighbours. Especially if the neighbour is a grammar school. (INAUDIBLE) A school will succeed best when, together with the home, it sets out to interpret each child for what he is, and what he can become. When each day, each moment, is valued as a precious pan' of life. And is not allowed to be thrown away, or treated with indifference. Our children are a reflection of ourselves. We could as adults, as parents, as teachers, as employers, make sure our young people are dissatisfied with second-best. And it is from us, that they could /earn to care more, rather than less. We could encourage them to stay on for those extra terms. To value education, so they will continue it throughout their lives. We could show them, by example, how to respect one another, through friendship and love. To be unselfish and better than we are. GIRL: X plus two, into X plus one, equals null. TEACHER: Right, we've got it at last... (STUDENTS REPEATING INDISTINCTLY) FEMALE TEACHER: Stop typing for a moment, please... MALE TEACHER: Well, that nearly brings us to the more serious part of the experiment. If we weigh the copper plate and then put it in the copper sulphate.
