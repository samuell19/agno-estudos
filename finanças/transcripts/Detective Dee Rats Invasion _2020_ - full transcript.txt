You beast! Well then don't! Bastard! A madman! DETECTIVE DEE - 狄公灭鼠 Di Ren Jie Killing Rats Dee Renjie, the detective of Bingzhou, reports to Taishou Yang. What is your concern, how can I serve you? Good friend, did you hear about the rat plague that bursted out from South-prison the day before yesterday? ? The prison has collapsed. Several prisoners escaped. And a prison guard died in a strange way. I heard about that. Good friend, What are your thoughts? I do not believe in demons or ghosts. From my point of view it was either an escape trick by the prisoners or a normal plague of rats. You are quite right. That's my opinion too. But the South-prison has partially collapsed. And the guards have lost track, because of the plague of rats. So that this chaos would not spread any further, I gave the order to restore the Taishoufu prison. I'm ordering you and some officers to go to the South-prison and to transfer the prisoners from there to us. Order accepted. - Get that out quick, okay? - Yes. He's leaving here too. Caution! Come on! Go ahead! We pick them up! Yes, okay. We are ready. The prison is partially destroyed. That's why all the prisoners now are leaving their cells and under the supervision of Detective Di Renjie are transferred to Taishoufu Prison. Go one by one! Shut up! Go on. Go! - Come on! - Okay, I got it. Faster, come on! Look, Dee Renjie! So we meet again. Shut your mouth! I thought I'd never have to see your killer visage again after I sent you to death row! Do you long for my death so much? Oh, yeah. People who kill others for fun, I like to eat raw! Without anything else to it. What a pity! Can't you hold out until fall? Others grant me a longer life than you do. What do you mean by that? Do you still have a right to exist after I'm dead, Di Renjie? Even if I shouldn't live anymore I don't want people like you to exist! So then... kill me! Kill me! Kill me! What are you waiting for? Come on! What is stopping you? Kill me! You don't wish for anything more! Sorry. I am not like you. I don't intend to be like that either. When you're done, take him away! Come on! Ah, Di Renjie! You are as soft as a wife! Hell becomes present, the rat plague has the power! If you go on like this, no one will survive this plague in the end! Then the citizens of Bingzhou were unlucky! Clear the way! for the prisoner transport! Out of the way! Clear the way! for the prisoner transport! Out of the way! step aside! Clear the way! You too! Pass us on the right or left! Out of the way! Out of the way! Move aside! What about him? Wait! We free you from the yoke! Moment! Look out! Come on! Run away from here quickly! Please set us free! kneel down Kneel down everyone! Out of the way! Get up and keep walking! - There they are! - Stop! - Forget those two! Let's get away! - Go! Stay here both of you! We must pay attention! The rat plague is spreading rapidly. You two get them to South-hospital for treatment. Don't touch them! We don't have to take them away! Senior physician Lu is here! Ah yes! Senior physician Lu and Miss Lu, You've come at just the right time! What happened here? The two probably fell over the cart while trying to escape. Oh say, Miss Lu! Isn't the hospital in South-town? What are you looking for here in the north? My mother and I were at City Hall. There's nothing more we can do. They are dead? That's how it is The two have contracted the rat plague. There, look! Traces of rat bites on her body. And abscesses on the back. The veins are black accompanied by internal bleeding. The typical signs of rat plague. If the infection is not treated in time, you die within three days. It's going fast! Why is the rat plague so horrible this time? You know, mMy mother and I were at City Hall to report to the mayor. He was very busy right now and didn't have time for us. Di Renjie! Disposing of the dead is the priority at the moment, so the disease doesn't spread. - Di Renjie! - Yes? Does Taishou Yang know about the rat plague outbreak? No, probably not yet. Well, then please put him in knowledge! Tell him the situation is serious. And especially in the South-town. Many here are already infected. He should send us helpers, so that I can treat all sick people. - Yes. - Good. I have a letter for him here. In which I wrote all the details. Go to him with Siniang! If Taishou Yang should have any further questions, maybe Siniang can explain it to him. - Thank you for your dedicated effort. - You are welcome. ["GRAIN - FOOD"] - Brother! - What? They're not here for us. Why are they carrying the grain away from here in the middle of the night? If they get that out as well, our hiding place will be blown. Stop screaming! Are you crazy? No. Something pinched me. I'm bleeding. Just look! Those are just rats. Don't get so worked up! Rats! Everything is full of rats here! Get away quick! Strange! Why is no one to be seen? - So what's going on? - Nothing is going on. We go ahead. Get in quick! What is that? Who are you? Who breaks into City Hall at night? I'm Di Renjie, detective from Bingzhou. And I want to see Mayor Yang. Why are you hiding here? Didn't you also see the demon, that was just in the hallway? I only saw the both of you! And who are you? Don't ask for things that don't concern you. Taishou Yang has retreated inside. Find him there! Detective Di Renjie requests an audience! Come on in! Why are you returning at this late hour, my friend? A few prisoners died during their transfer of rat plague. That stopped us. The others are now in Taishoufu Prison. - Di Renjie reports back. - And the young lady? Who is this? This is senior physician Lu's daughter from South-hospital, Lu Siniang. The senior physician has a letter for you. She writes that the situation in the South-town is serious, and hopes that you can send even more helpers, to treat the sick and stop the spread of the plague. Please read the letter! You think I don't know about the rat plague in South-town? General Ouyang Ping, which you just met here came especially because of the rat plague. What? A general? Ouyang Ping is the commanding officer of the Military Governor of the province in Bingzhou. The name will terrify everyone tomorrow. He will take action. Your words are a mystery to me. You will understand them tomorrow. Go now! Get well! Go to sleep The coming days will be very demanding for all of us. Taishou... - All right, leave now! - Yes. And hep! Come over! I? What's wrong? I'm taking the miss to South-hospital. Let us pass! I'm sorry, Dee Renjie, Taishou Yang has imposed a curfew on both halves of the city. Nobody is allowed in or out. Anyone who violates the order has to expect immediate execution. without special permission, I really can't let you through. What do we do now? I can't go to the hospital. Ah, not so bad. At daybreak we leave the North-town and go around into the South-town. Tonight, unfortunately you will have to spend with me, if it doesn't bother you. If it doesn't bother you. Caution! Out of the way! Go away! What are they doing on the street so early? Do they go shopping? They don't go shopping! They are on the run. On the run? Look at their luggage! They have the essentials with them, what they need to live. They all seem to be fleeing the city. Apparently word got around about the plague. We have to hurry. Otherwise they close the city gate. Come! - Open the city gate! - Open up! We want out! Who is responsible for! Get the man! Open up. I want to get out! Open up! I have to go to work. Open the gate! Open the gate! Stop! Stop! Stop! I'm Di Renjie, the detective. Who is in charge with you? May I ask you? Why did you close the city gate? And why are you shooting at these people? Citizens of Bingzhou City! Listen up! I am Ouyang Ping Dudu-General for Bingzhou. And as of today, this gate and the others will remain closed! Nobody is allowed in or out of the city! Are you locking us in here? Who ordered the lockdown? For what reason? And until when is that valid? The rat plague broke out here and spreads rapidly. There is no cure yet. To avoid its spread, the army was ordered to lock down the city. Only when there is no more case of infection, the city gate is opened again. Hey! When we're locked up with the sick, we get even more the rat plague and are going to die. We fled from those so we don't get infected. Open! Open the gate! This is pure madness, what you do to us! It's not enough that we all get infected. Now, where do we get our food from? We will starve. Have pity on us, General! Let's get out of town, General! Let's get out of here! Be quiet! I have ordered your mayor to act. to bring the disease under control, figure out how to spot it early. When that happened, the gate will open again. This is how you will drive the citizens of Bingzhou to despair! Citizens! We storm the gate! We storm the gate! No. Wait! Well, all right! Calm down! Stop it! What's that! If you don't calm down, I'll have you arrested! Not only incitement to rebellion is punishable by death. Anyone trying to break through here, will be shot. We die with certainty, if we stay here. If we want one more chance, it's now or never, friends! There you go! Storm the gate! - Go! - Wait! You're not allowed to! Be reasonable! Stop it! Archers! Get ready! At my command! Ouyang Ping! Save them? How am I supposed to do this? Like everyone else, I'm locked up here! You haven't figured that out yet. Now you as a detective and I as the mayor, are potentially contagious! By order of the government, the whole city was cut off from the outside world. They gave up on us. We have to take care of the citizens. Save the citizens, also means saving ourself! At the moment it's about more helpers for the hospital. Senior physician Lu is desperatly trying to find a cure. Even if the sick still cannot be cured, we must stop the spread of the plague. The food supplies will last another two weeks. If the lockdown lasts, then people have to starve. Two weeks? Good friend, you have little experience. If you knew, what I know. To avoid that the disease spreads across the river, the general cut us off from all sources of water. - It can't be... - I'm sorry, what? Then in less than three days there is no fresh water. And a person can't even go a week without water. Fortunately, in North-town, not a single case has occurred yet. We have enough to eat here. And we also have our own well. In the meantime, I've had South-town declared a quarantine zone. Neither humans nor animals are allowed to cross the zone boundary. Should the situation change... Maybe Ouyang Ping will unlock Bingzhou earlier. The sooner the better, right? Then the citizens of the Sowth-town are doomed to die. The rat plague is rampant! You saw it with your own eyes! Death strikes there without mercy. How can I still save the people? The South-town is already the city of death. Humans are all doomed to die. I can't do magic either! Good friend! I know you are a merciful person. But you have to understand one thing. In order to get something, you have to give something. You may leave. Now go to the checkpoint from the quarantine zone! Why are you kneeling in front of me? Siniang asks you, don't give up on the citizens of the South-town, please. Keep faith, that my mother and I will find a cure for the rat plague. So many human lives depend on it. You can't just die like that! Please, detective Di! Do whatever it takes to save the citizens of South-town. Siniang, Siniang will support you with all her strength! Come, get up! You don't have to ask for anything, Miss Lu! As an official in the service of Bingzhou City, I am obliged to save the life of every citizen. Even if you hadn't said anything, I would. Now please get up! Thank you Mr. Di! We gotta come up with something, how to get through the checkpoint to South-town. Brother! Damn! I'm sick, puke sick! Come on! I'll take you to a doctor now! Here for you! - Oh, uh... - Mr. Di? Mayor Yang meant, I'm supposed to help you at the checkpoint. Aha! We really need every helping hand. What is it about the dead? This people tried to break through with violence and escape from the quarantine zone. You could have expelled them. Did you have to kill them? The day before yesterday we were able to stop them, from going over here. Then they armed themselves and attacked us. They were crazy. Some even bit us. We had no choice. And many of them were already struck. After a few tries they dropped dead. I heard about that. I can confirm that. They were all infected with the rat plague. Your eyes are bloodshot. The many red spots. And the many openings on the skin, from which the blood gushed. Advanced Hemorrhage. They must have been very desperate, while trying the to break barriers. It was in vain. I have a request! To prevent the disease from spreading further, we have to burn the dead. Okay. What's going on there? That's their war howl they charge at us with. Draw your weapons! This is for emergencies only! Use the sword only for self defense! Stop it! It is not worth! You guys are pretty daring! Why are you breaking through here, with no rhyme or reason? Well, why? You took our supplies away from South-town and blocked our wells. We have nothing to eat and nothing to drink. Before we die anyway, let's fight! Hey what? There was no more danger from him. Why did you kill him? By order of the Taishous, any escape attempt is punishable by death! And he was already infected, Mr. Di. If he spreads the disease in the North-town? Moron! - Miss Lu! - Yes. Let's go! Order from Taishou: Even from the North-town, no one is allowed to go to the South-town! Violations will be punished with death! I'm the city detective. Can't even I come over here? Mr. Di! One last time! Order from Taishou. Only with his permission, you are able to pass the checkpoint. No prisoners are taken here! Let's go! Di Renjie! What do we want in prison? Who wants to save from hell, needs people who know hell. Where are all the guards? They were assigned to guard the borders. Then the prisoners haven't eaten or drunk anything for days? It happens to them same like people from Soth-town. They must be starving too. Please help us! We are hungry and thirsty! Save us! Open the cells! We want out! They forgot us here! Please please! I beg you! Have mercy on us poor souls. Give us a piece of bread and a cup of water! You can't let us die! What did we do to deserve this? Xiaoyou? Di Lang! Aha! I've been wondering why you haven't been here yet. Now I understand. you have a new one A misunderstanding. This is Miss Lu from South-hospital. Please go ahead and hand out water and food to the prisoners. Yes. - Is it true? You get me out of here? - Sure. I knew it! You love me more than your work! Actually... I just wanted you ask for your help Dumbass! For help? You are totally crazy! Senior physician Lu and Miss Siniang try to find a cure for the plague. That's why we have to go to South-town. All hell is breaking loose in South-town at the moment! Maybe senior physician Lu is long dead too. Trust me one more time! Or even better. You just have to show me how to get to the South-town. You can stay here. And then flee Bingzhou. You can also wait, until it's all over. I'll leave you satisfied too. Di Lang! You know, I've been committed to you for a long time. So no matter what you ask of me, I can't say no anymore. I thank you. Well look! We'll see each other so soo again. What you said last time... Hell becomes present the rat plague has the power. Then the citizens of Bingzhou just had bad luck! What was that supposed to mean? Isn't that self-explanatory? Haven't you already seen it? What else do you know? I'm straight from hell. I remember very well what hell smells like. You'll get one last chance to escape death. If you don't work together with me, that's it for you. What did you say? Did I understand that correctly? The unbeatably resourceful Di Renjie needs the help of a prisoner, awaiting his death? Enough! Wait! I'll help you. Come along! I don't get it. These are just simple guards. We can kill them and in no time we're over there. - Wouldn't that be easier? - Be quiet! In here! - Who's there? - Go! Get in here! Come on! Hurry! Shixiong! I know you are brave But we don't have any time to waste. One more thing and you'll have to die. Great detective! If I'm not mistaken, you need my help. But is that a way, to ask someone for something? Well, I want to be nice too. I'm tied up, and you have a sword. You don't always have to jump right out of your skin. - Here it is! - Tell me, Xiaoyou! What was this tunnel made for? Thats's quite simple. She dug this one herself. She comes from a family of grave robbers. She has long dug tunnels under the houses of all rich families. As soon as she has a shovel in her hand, she starts digging. It's in her blood. Di Lang! That sounds somehow not for a compliment. I think you're awesome, Xiaoyou. I am a weak woman I can't even catch a chicken. Hey! How long are you going to stand there? The sun will rise soon again. Right this way! Where do the branches lead? Why are they so small? For the thieves! No normal tall person can get through that. Xiaoyou is slim and immensely flexible. She can do it. Aha. What? Oh, nothing special! Just the smell seems familiar to me. What smell? The smell of hell. Gods of the sky! Send your messengers down to earth! So that they can rid Bingzhou of the rat plague. Is it here? It must be here! The exit is bricked up. Help me! - What are you doing? - Come on! Better help! Don't open! If they find out we're hiding people here, we'll be in big trouble! Understood! Excuse me! How can rat meat taste so good to you? I'm different from you. In prison I had to starve all the time. My first meal since days. It doesn't taste bad at all. Definitely much better than raw rat meat. Have you eaten it raw yet? So you guys have been here since the South-town lockdown. In the old temple. This isn't the first time. This isn't my first epidemic. Beware of the hospital! Those who are not yet infected will be infected there at the latest. Why don't you stay at home? After the lockdown, great chaos broke out. The sick began to plunder. People believe that ghosts are haunting here. Nobody dares to come here. Luckily! Di Renjie. Isn't everyone here infected with the rat plague? The ones I examined had no visible signs. They were just malnourished and not as resilient. That's strange. They all eat rat meat every day, don't they? Peculiar! And most in the hospital had no contact at all with rats and were still infected. Please, only people with a cough or fever line up with me. Here you get your medicine! If you're not sick, go over there! Here only for sick people! Come on, you're next! - I have a fever and a cough! - There is enough for everyone! - Mr. Liang! - Ah, Siniang! - Where is my mother? - You finally are back! Your mother is already expecting you. She's over in the Great Hall! Go visit her! Yes. - Who else wants medicine? - Di Renjie! Right this way! Mother! - Mother! - Oh, I'm so happy! That must have been exhausting. ["HOSPITAL"] Thank you. I'm terribly sorry but we need the rest of the water, to cook the herbs. It's with rainwater. You have to be content with that. Times are hard. Don't worry about it! Thanks for your understanding. You gave the letter to Taishou Yang personally? - Yes. - He... Apparently he sent the two along with him, but... I need a lot more people. It was like this. He has indeed received your lines. But... I'm afraid he has ... Yang Qinhtian! How can you let us down like this? I just want to tell you this: We came here risking our lives. Because I'm convinced, that you will succeed, in finding the desired cure for the rat plague. And if that is the case, then there are good prospects of lifting the lockdown on South-town. And I hope that you will get enough help and helpers, to save the inhabitants of the South-town. Di Renjie! Come with me! Look! In these days the rats attack the people increasingly frequent and numerous. Also, we're running out of water and food. The inhabitants are weakened. And the Plague spreads even faster. If this goes on for a long time, the South-town becomes a graveyard. But how come you still haven't found a cure for the rat plague? - Xiaoyou! - Oh! I told you, you should flee the city with me. You didn't want to listen to me. Now we're hanging here! And if we also get infected now, we've made it. Stop fussing. You found a cure for the rat plague, didn't you, mother? Well, otherwise you wouldn't have sent me to Mayor Yang with your petition letter. The tea you give to the sick is effective against the rat plague, isn't it? I though,t it would. But I assumed wrong.. I thought I had found something against it. But it only alleviates the symptoms. It doesn't really heal. The infected live just a few days longer. We pray for you! The rats are like the wind, the plague is like fire. Even if the wind is strong, it is not deadly. But wind and fire together make no more grass grow. Hey big friend! There's a real poet slumbering in you. It doesn't match your appearance at all. Just one question. Does eating rat meat, lead to getting infected? Well, the viruses are transmitted through rat bites. This is the normal route of infection. Eating the rats will make you sick even faster. Even if the meat is cooked? Anyone who eats infected rat meat, will become infected. Then something is wrong. In the temple they almost all ate boiled rat meat and have not been infected. In the end, isn't it about the rats? But something else? Could this possibly be some disease caused by another virus?? Absolutely not! Look at the people! They were all bitten by rats and got sick because of it. Maybe the people in the temple ate rats, who were not infected. Yes that could be. But to find out, we have to find the rat's nest first. Find the rat's nest? Where are you even going to start looking? Dee Renjie! Are you sure that the rat's nest is here in prison? This is where the plague first broke out. So we should be able to find the rat's nest around here somewhere. In this shithole I was kept for months. I'm not going any further now. You do not have to. You can go back to the South-hospital with Miss Lu. Di Lang! Come over! Say! Can you listen to me just once and not look for the rat's nest? Go back with me! And flee the city with me, when the coast is clear! You can guess the answer. How can I abandon the citizens of South-town? How are you going to do it alone? How are you going to save thousands of residents of Bingzhou city, my god? Di Lang! You... once said, when you die, then your heart stays here. Only with me. Please, listen to me this time, okay? If you keep going like this, you'll die! Bloody hell! Is it worth dying for? Now stop it! I've made my decision. There is no turning back. You stubborn! Alright! So since you want to die, don't let that stop you. And take your heart with you! I dont want you anymore! Xiaoyou! And what now? Could you take care of her for me? Yes. Sure, Di Renjie! But be careful! On behalf of the citizens of Bingzhou, thank you. Do not worry! I'm trying, to find the nest. Hopefully it will help us find a cure for the rats. We'll find a cure when we know what is causing the disease. On behalf of the citizens of Bingzhou: Thank you. Actually you can go too. I do not need you. Join them! You worry too much, Di Renjie. I never intended, to assist you. I just found the whole thing very interesting. More interesting than killing people? Oh yeah! Otherwise you would have been dead long ago. Thanks, for not killing me yet. You, as the ambassador of hell, may have an idea. Say! Does the road ahead end well or very badly. All I know is that it's heading in the direction of hell. Let your curiosity run wild! Well, nice to have you. Will you show me the way? Sure, of course. - You're welcome! - You're welcome! Xiaoyou! Xiaoyou! What? You don't have to fret! Mr. Di is responsible. He cares about the country and the people. The citizens of the city can feel very lucky, that someone like him, would stand up for them. The people, the people! He doesn't think of anyone else! Couldn't he just think of himself and me? He should marry his stupid people! What? I'm going to the hospital, won't you come with me? To all those infected with rat plague? Should I get infected too? I'm going to my cave! That looks terrible. They gnawed him down to the bone in no time. How many rats are there? They come like a tsunami, so many. You say it as, if you experienced it. This is where I spent most of my time. Most of my life. Say! You want to find the rat's nest in my cell? Why shouldn't it be in your cell? You're welcome! Have fun searching! Mr. detective! Found something! What? That should be the entrance to the rat's nest you're looking for. This door leads down to the dungeon. Since the end of the war, it hasn't been used. You are probably assuming, the gnawing marks here are from the rats? Obviously. They're so small they only could be from this cursed rats. I didn't think, they have such strong teeth. They are afraid of fire. With the torches we can keep them off our backs. This one for you! Let me go first! I know my way around in hell better. Men are all liars! Love of my life! Ha! And swear eternal loyalty! Su Xiaoyou, Su Xiaoyou! Why do you play with eagles? They think they own the whole world. Finally get rational! This looks like an alchemy room! More like a torture chamber. Mother! What are they doing with the straw? When you weren't there, the rats came dangerously close to us. At night, the rodents go in search of food and attack the residents. Here everything smells very much like death. Judging by the layer of dust and the degree of decomposition of the dead, this could coincide with the outbreak of rat plague in prison? It looks like, the Rat plague spread from here. If the rat plague originated here, then where are the rats? Where is the rat's nest? The last rice supplies. This is all we had left. Even if we defeat the rat plague, we will starve. You and me and all the citizens we don't have much time left. The rats are here! Fire! - Light the fire! - Mother? Hurry! The rats are here! Bring in more straw! Hurry! We still need straw! Go! Don't leave a gap! Light it up! Wait a minute! Yet don't light it! Wait! Hurry, Mr. Liang, over here! Wait! I'm coming! - Please wait! - Now we have to light... -No! -Come on! No! No! Go away - Dear God! - Mr. Liang! Get out of here! Oh God! Help! Help! Di Lang! Help me! Help! Why are you back? You think this is voluntary? I met the beasts and escaped from them! Why are they gone now? Maybe there is something much bigger and more terrifying in the game? Oh God! Someone is doing alchemy here. And tests his preparations on the inmates on death row. And this is where all the dead came. And became food for the rats, which have multiplied rapidly. They have become accustomed to human flesh. That's why they attack people. When it's dark. The dead here are extremely poisonous. Even a few rats didn't survive. And maybe they are scared of this. Maybe they are afraid of the smell of the poisoned dead. And therefore they don't dare, to follow us here. And this rat plague? I guess, the pathogen is found in the corpses here. And the rats ate the bodies and thus spread the pathogen. Good conclusion! Brilliant! Not bad, Di Renjie! But who is the unknown alchemist, behind this? Unimportant! We need to quickly inform senior physician Lu first. About the cause. Stop it! That doesn't help! This Rice porridge is just enough to die for! It can't go on like this, folks! I saw with my own eyes, the mayor store all the grain into the town hall district. We're just waiting to die here. We need to break the barrier! Bring back our supplies! There's water too! Wait! I want to tell you something too! That was the last bit. There is nothing left. Even if I could heal you, and protect the others from contagion, I still couldn't feed you. We're trapped here. The whole South-town has been cordoned off and declared a quarantine zone, from which no one can get out. At night the rats attack us. Where are the promised Officials, who should help us? They let us down. And stole our food and water and took it to themself to City Hall. And they're leaving us to starve here! Let the rats bite us! And eat up our supplies in peace. This man is absolutely right! Instead of waiting to die, we'd rather fight Mayor Yang. - Let's storm the town hall district! - What do we have to lose? Let's get our food and water! That's the only way we still have a chance to survive! We'd rather die upright! Better standing up than lying down! Better fight to the death! Better fight to the death! Better fight to the death! Let's get all the weapons and torches and storm the town hall! Yes! Strange! Why is no one to be seen? Did the soldiers storm the South-town? Impossible. Ouyang Ping is a tough dog. But he doesn't kill people for no reason. Hurry, Xiaoyou! There ahead is the hospital! Yes, Di Lang. I'm coming. Anyone here? Hello? Where have they all gone? I can imagine. I already know where they are. What's going on there? Hey, Xiaoyou! Looks like she got a fever? What? - You were bitten! - It will be OK! Go and find the senior physician! - Oh God! No! - Let her know! She has to find a cure for the rat plague. I am tired. That really goes fast! The doctor said she has a drug, that will ease the symptoms. You Renjie! Did you find the remedy? Your girlfriend... What about you? what about me What do you think? You knew from the start! And you led me by the nose! Cut the nonsense, Di Renjie! What did I already know? What are these beads? One is from the alchemy room and the other one from here! Explain that to me! Come on! Di Renjie! I explain it like this: This has nothing to do with me. If you found a bead here, I guess it means, the doctor is involved.. Her statement to find a remedy against it, was apparently only pretended. Nonsense! You want to keep fooling me? You were able to move freely in prison. You are also involved in that rat plague story! When I was at City Hall, you were the shadow in the corridor! Am I right? Not bad, Di Renjie! What do you want to know from me? You know exactly, what I want to know from you. All right then! Alright! I also was only one of the guinea pigs. Immediately after my admission they started giving me sedatives, mixed with the food. I was dazed. Stunned, they brought me down in the alchemy room. I couldn't perceive much anymore! But I can still remember very well, this smell there. And that they have experimented with other inmates too. Most didn't survive, but I got awake shortly after ingestion. I was apparently immune to the weird stuff I got. I did not meet any of the other prisoners ever again, who were down there with me. In the course of the experiments, I have identified changes in my body. They don't work on a poison, that's very much clear. They are looking for an agent, which makes immortal. Then I realized, why they hadn't executed me. They really wanted to find out, why I was the only person, who survived their torture unscathed. Because you survived, they did continue to experiment on you. What happened in the town hall? Why, have you been there? What happened there this evening? That evening, they took me to the mayor's room. Yang Qingtian was already eager on my blood for his new remedy. But Ouyang Ping has surprised him with the message to lock down the city. Taishou Yang! Ouyang Ping, the Dudu-Officer from Bingzhou is here. Get him away! Hide him back there! Apparently, the general should not see me. Taishou Yang. Somehow I dragged myself away. In the end they got me and put me back in jail. All right! I'm coming with you! Now just tell me, that you would suspect Taishou Yang. Certainly! Already since I was in the alchemy room, I suspected Yang. Nonsense! Maybe for you he's the kind of a father figure. And you don't want to admit it. But what I did not think is, that the senior physician Lu Zhishuo is his accomplice. Di Lang! Di Lang! Xiaoyou! Are you feeling better? I heard everything I'm about to die. - Oh, no. - My dearest! My last words. Only for you! To love and be loved, is the greatest happiness, that I had in my short, beautiful life! In your... In your arms... to... die in your arms, is the most beautiful thing I can have. Di Lang! I love you. I knew it! You love me more than your work! You know that I have already promised you long. Your heart stays here. Only for Su Xiaoyou. Go, go, go! Bring the sacks here! Come on! Get even more done! Open! Open up! You have no chance against us! Here! What? General! There is fire in several places! And the biggest fire is in City Hall district. Where did it start? We're not allowed into town. So we don't know for sure. We're going to town now! No, wait! Without explicit command, we are not allowed to go there. Only when danger is imminent. Who the hell was that? I want to talk to your superior, General Ouyang Ping! I am General Ouyang Ping. II should pass a message from Di Renjie, the Detective of the City of Bingzhou, he now would have found a cure against the rat plague. But he needs your help. Without you, many many people are going to not survive the night. General, the man is tied up. A prisoner. He's not credible. Senior physician Lu! Don't do that! We can talk about anything. I almost found it. Our remedy for immortality. You get it too. We could become immortal together. Is that nothing? - Oh no! - No? Oh, Taishou Yang! I did not deserve so much happiness. Oh, no, senior physician! How can you say that? You were so kind to help me to find the remedy for immortality. So much time and so much effort, you put into the development of the agent! Wouldn't it simple be right and proper, to share the reward of it at all. - How generous you... - Yes. ... to not misappropriate, that I helped you manufacturing the remedy. Sure, of course! Then why did you abondon me so inglorious with the Rat plague and pushed me aside? You received a letter from my daughter and just ignored it. You even put my hospital under quarantine and watched, how the plague and the rats spread more and more. All you hoped was, that I just like the others, who got infected through the rat bites, would perish! No. So that no one can attest, that you experimented on prisoners. What! That was all just a misunderstanding. This happened by order of the Dudu-officer. I'm just the mayor! What could I have done? Well, much too late! Sorry! Too late! Unfortunately, I also can not become immortal anymore. Let's die together, huh? What about that? Did you take a globule? What's so called harmless globule, means it is pure poison, you scharlatan! Pure poison! Pass me the torch! Senior physician Lu! Have mercy! Have mercy! Please don't! Stop! - Di Renjie! - Good friend! Glad you got back safely. Shut your mouth! Listen everyone! Behind all this thing is none other but these two! You and Yang, you are under one blanket. You have secretly researched a remedy of immortality. You have experimented with people. And instead of burying them properly, the rats ate them. And they transfered the deadly resource from the deceased, continuously to the until then perfectly healthy residents. And when you realized, that Yang Qingtian didn't help you, you did start hating him and instigated all to storm the City Hall district. Doctors should be like loving parents. Don't you have a conscience at all? Mother! Is that true, what he says, mother? Of course it isn't true. You all know, how Di Renjie and Yang Qingtian are connected to each other. Almost like father and son. Just to save this guy, he invents fairy tales here. Kill Di Renjie! Finish him off! Kill Di Renjie! Finish him off! Kill Di Renjie! Finish him off! Di Renjie! Stop! Uh, the soldiers. Surrender! Down with the guns!! Come on! Please don't hurt us. No! Siniang! Would you really have killed her, you wouldn't be a whit better than me. Good friend! Help me! Help me, good friend! Get out of here! What, what's that about, Di Renjie? We have to put an end to the rat plague! Help me! Wait, stop, you are crazy! Oh! Alright! Di Renjie! - Come on! - After him! Stay there! ["RICE-LIQUOR"] ["HERE RESTS SU XIAOYOU"] You are too late. Next time I come to your grave, I will be on time. Xiaoyou had dug a tunnel to City Hall and stole the liquor. This tunnel was my salvation. To owe someone a favor after his death... Do you still miss Xiaoyou? I've thought about it, whether I should do like An Shixiong. And create justice by breaking the rules and the law, Xiaoyou shouldn't have died. Maybe the others can. Not a detective like Di Renjie! You don't do that. Out of the question! Here! What is that? Your transposition to Chang'an. To Chang'an? See you in Chang'an!
