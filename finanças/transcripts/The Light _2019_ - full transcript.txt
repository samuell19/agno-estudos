You'd like the farm Ben. Yeah? Yep. You've got to work though. Put up fences. Get your hands dirty. I can do that. You sure about that? Of course. - I hate it here. - The field? Ah no. Kalgoorlie. I like it. It's home. Not for long. Mona says uni's the best years of your life. - She would. - Yeah. I don't buy it. I think I want to help people. Don't look at me like that Ben. Sorry. Aster just do you. You'll do great things. Thanks. Is your dad still on the road? Because if you were my daughter Weirdo. - Aster. - What? Careful. No no, give me the knife. Give me the knife. Mine-no-fine! Of course you carry a pocket knife. No it's good, it's good. You're armed at all times. Thanks. It was my dad's. - Sergeant Terry Wakeley. - Does he call? - Never. - We could try and find him. We could. Dude. I'm legit so hungry, I haven't eaten breakfast yet. Why don't you just grab something to eat? You okay? Rockwell's been playing his trumpet all morning. - Ooh. - So no. I'm not. It's real bad. He's played 'Happy Birthday' twice. - It's his birthday. - That's sad. Don't feel bad. Well he's got no-one to sing him happy birthday Dean, that's sad. Yeah, it's the fucking worst. Now here we go, and a one, two I welcome death. Jules! Jules. Come sit with us. I'm comfortable Dean. - What you're too good for us? - It's not like that. I just think it's funny how, you know- -Whatever Dean. Excuse me?! Why are you being like this, - honestly? - How am I being like? You're so rude to me. You were nice to me the other day. - I am never rude to you. - You're the most two-faced person I've ever met. I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, 100%. You're so rude to everyone else, and then you're nice to them when you want something from them. I don't ignore you. I always reply to you. - You just- - I'm talking to you right now. You're nice one minute and you're mean the other! Well I'm sorry! Honestly. You don't even reply to my texts. - I reply to every single text. - Yeah you just fucking thumbs up emoji every time. That's not a reply. You can't respond to - that. - Yeah that's a reply. No, the conversation doesn't go on from there. - It's a reply. - Yeah, fucking I don't know, - emojis and shit, and that's- - I gave you the thumbs up emoji. I don't know what you want from me. Thumbs up is different to like, I don't know like a happy face emoji. Well I'm sorry. I don't know what you want from me. I don't know. Twenty-seven love hearts. It's not funny. You're ridiculous. - You've changed. - I've changed? Grow up Dean. King Wes. It's his nickname. - You've got this. - Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for taking the time out of a busy recess. I have an invitation. The chance for new blood in 'The Light'. Our own little social game. We're after new teams. Could be the next Red Gravity. I'll tell you how to play. But first I'm eager to give you all a little motivation. Can you keep this quiet? CROWD: Yes. - Yes! - Thank you Mona. Calder. One thousand dollars. No counterfeit. No bullshit. - King Wes. - Queen Aster. Tell them it's real. Seems legit. All this, is for any team that can win 'The Light'. - How do you win 'The Light'? - Action. There's so much talk and never any action in Kal. I mean the social landscape it- -It's dead. Dead. I'm introducing the pin tin. Seven pins. One awarded weekly to the team with the most stories. Most pins after seven weeks wins the cash. What's a story? A social happening. Something people talk about. Parties, hook-ups, drinks, fights, pranks. It all counts. If you make life interesting, you get a better shot at that week's pins. Most pins after seven weeks gets the cash. Is that clear enough? - You're giving away a grand? - Yeah. - That's fucked. - I got money to burn. Maybe, Markus, we can breathe some life into this town. Sign up teams with Copper. We'll go from there. Thank you! Also! New Red Gravity addition. Juliet Longmire ladies and gentlemen. Thank you! You look thrilled. Yeah, people do dumb shit to make stories. You, me, Travi, Dean, Markus, and Aster. Team Gold! - No. - It's a good name! No I'm just not a part of it. Okay. - You in it for the money? - I like the idea. Make shit happen. And the money. Oh shit! Sorry. Ben. Don't stress. - I was in your way. - I wasn't looking. Hey you'll be at my party tomorrow yeah? Lewis was pretty keen on getting Team Gold social. Oh yeah, I think it's great. Was my speech okay today? I'm just never sure, and I'm trying to get the whole system - together you know? - Oh yeah, you're doing good. I'll see you at mine tomorrow yeah? Seven-thirty? - Absolutely. - Beautiful. Weasel. Llama. Axolotl. Does that beg-end with an L? - L, yes. - L? A liger. - Rabbit. - Um... - Did you put this here? - Tyrannosaurus rex. - Are you joking? - Oh! - Jesus, come on man. - Seriously? Oh my God. Sorry Jase. I'm sorry. It's going everywhere. Oh my God. - What the- - Hm. A love letter. - Creepy. - Yeah. Do you know about this? Could be a story. You could be a story. Good one, you piece of shit. Ooh! Violent. Oh my God! Um we were just wondering if we could get Ben and Dean - for a second? - Shouldn't you be in class? - We have a free period. - Yeah. We were let out. And we'll just talk to them for like one second. It's like nothing, at all. We'll bring them right back. - It's fine. - Really quickly. It's really important. Why do you have glitter on you? Like all over you? Sorry. Um, are you coming to mine tomorrow? - What for? - You didn't tell him? - What is this? - I'm having a couple of people over, before Wes'. I'll pick you up. No parents. Oh shit. I don't know what you're implying Mona. Oh. No parents means... no parents. - What are you up to? - Waiting for Aster. Do you like her? - Yeah. I do. - Aw Ben that's cute. You two are made for each other. - Jules! - Oh, Dean! - Yep. - Team Gold right? - Ah, yeah. That's right. - Tough guy. I am the toughest man. I'll see you at Aster's. She drives like a maniac. You be careful. Alright. I had my lights off. Hey, can-can we pull over? Nah fuck him. For me, please? Aster. Fine. You okay? - I'm good. - Aster. What? Same car. Let's get out of here. - You think it's a story? - I dunno. It's not buried. You just gotta look Ben. Any house, anywhere. You'll find a little darkness. A little evil. I think you saw that today. And it bothers you. Radiohead sing about it a lot. - Who's Radiohead? - Aster. Don't condescend to me. - I'm going to the toilet. - Okay. Ben. Ben. - How is she? - Why do you care? - Are you gonna kiss? - I don't know. Physical contact builds trust in relationships. Plus you're making good eye contact. - I read in Men's Weekly that- - You read Men's Weekly? - Of course. - Okay. You can tell she likes you dude. You should totally get your dick wet. - What?! - You could get your dick wet. Probably shouldn't say that Travi. Ben's a good looking... fellow... - Shut up. - What? Boys. What's up? Talking about... ah... relationships. Travi was saying Ben should get his dick wet, presumably with one of your orifices. Ah ha. What do you reckon? - Let's go bud. - Okay. Hey. Have you seen Wes? Um. Yeah. He said he'd come by but, no. Aster. What is he doing? Lock the doors. - ...fuck Travi? - I'll take it. Ah, this isn't going to come to that. This is a terrible weapon. Aster. Come on. - Should we call the police? - Ahh, I don't know. Yes. Keys Aster. - Do you think it's a prank? - Or it's Wes. - Do you know that? - I don't know. Then don't make false accusations. Get down. Dean, get the lights. DIGITAL VOICE OVER SPEAKER: Exits are blocked. Don't turn me off. Listen closely. Nobody try anything. In thirty seconds, you will send someone outside. Or we will enter. We will pins Aster Mulloch down and gouge out both of her eyes one by one. - No one's gonna hurt you. - Thirty. Why are you filming? Evidence. Twenty five. Shit. If they get inside, get around Aster. If it comes to that we will. All of us. - I got a spatula. - Fifteen. Ten. Aster no. Five. Don't do it. Don't. Get out here now. Markus? Agh! Ben. Boys and girls. Your king. Wesley Broaden. Clap for your king. Clap or Wes gets it. It's only just beginning. We are Cannon. Where's Markus? With doctors. Can we see him? Soon. You guys know if they caught anyone? Where were you guys when they came in? Under the house. What did they call themselves again? Cannon. You know they're just people. - Fuck! - What? Markus can't wank anymore. He lost his fingers. I'll set you up in Libby's room Aster. Thanks Jo. Joanna? Mum. What are you doing? Folding. This wouldn't happen in the city. - Have you spoken to Aster? - Yeah. She's incredibly strong just, pissed at her mum. Yeah, well. If that was Libby, or you... I'd be there immediately. She doesn't care. Her mum. Doesn't care. I've been seeing it over and over. Markus. Aster looking back at her house. Wes with these... pins, stuck in his face. Your dad hated violence. Same. I wish he could talk to you. I don't want him here. I don't. I don't feel good alone. It feels like I'm underwater. What are you doing here?! Hey. What are you doing here?! Hey... Aster... Dean. Sorry for the home invasion. His idea. - Couldn't sleep. - It's all good. I am not sleeping tonight. We were thinking about going to the warehouse. Are your parents cool with that? - Kinda? - Bad idea. Mona will be there! We'll be fine. We need each other now. What's going on? - So, are we the only ones? - That's the idea. Relax. Any house rules? No loud music. - Long day, Lib? - Mm-hm. - I bet you ours was longer. - You don't know me. - I mean, he kind of does though. - I got drinks. - Ooh yeah. - Yep. I'll have one. It's probably just a prank gone wrong. Okay. - Were you terrified? - Nah. I wasn't. Any theories on Cannon Mona? What do you reckon? Just between the three of us. You gotta think outside the box right? Pranks have... relief. It's not a prank without someone saying "It's just a prank bro." or the slightly more bullshit "It's a social experiment." And that's all missing here. The tensity has not faded. - So, there's a motive? - You're onto it. We didn't do shit wrong though. Could be your cop dad Libby. Sergeant Terry Wakeley, back from the dead... craving justice. My dad's an absentee Lewis, and deadbeat's different than dead, so- -Figure of speech. It could be anybody. It's Kalgoorlie. Everybody knows everybody. Do you know I'm moving over East? Shit. I didn't. - That sounds awesome. - Yeah. - Never been on a flight before. - What? I said I've never been on a flight before, okay? - Really? - Yes! Aww... It's a tense, coming-of-age thriller thing. Critics hate it. Well I love it. Can we watch something nice? Horror is nice. It's about facing your fears Aster. No. Oh my God, get away from me. It's just a little too real tonight. You can't run from it. - What? - They can. Not forever. They wanted me to say goodnight. Who's they? Mona and Libby. I don't get it. She went with Mona. They were exhausted. Hm. Ben, chill. Chill? Hey. Mona gets pretty high-strung. I'm sure they're just getting away from it all. Right. Alright, we're done here. I'm enjoying myself actually. This isn't a party Lewis. You get that right? Shit. Careful. What the fuck? Travi. Oh fuck. What did they do? What are you doing? Put it down! Lewis. Lewis, what are you doing? Covering it! They killed him. It's not right. You shouldn't have brought us here. - What? - What? - No no no what did you say? - You suggested it. You change your tune pretty quickly Lewis. You brought us here! It wasn't even my idea- -You both did! Ben. What do we do? Call the police. Have PTSD. We should've invited him. Jeez I feel sorry for that kid. Have you texted Libby? Yeah she's hanging with Mona. - Why? - Dunno. - Ben, right? - Yeah. Can we talk in private? You were a little toddler when I last saw ya. You're like him. You get in trouble like him. - Peter. - Hey. Did you know your dad spray painted the post office in year twelve? Did you know that? He loved you to pieces Ben. Trying times. Just ah, let me know if you need anything. Have you heard of Cannon? - Yeah. - Yeah? Cannon were big, for your dad and me. - Looks like they're back. - What do you mean? Peter! One second. They're gonna cut the investigation short. - Why? - Fear. Of what they're gonna do next. Peter! Just tell Jo I say hi. You wanna ask me how I'm feeling? - How're you feeling? - Shit. Tell me about Aster. What do you wanna know? Just checking in. - She's such a punk. - Is that a good thing? - Yeah. - You'd hope so. I've been seeing Travi a lot. We'll never get to talk to him again. That world we lived in a week ago, going to school, The Light. - Team Gold. - It's gone. There's nowhere to go anymore. The evil takes it out of you. I know. You don't need any other colour than that classic gold. I think it's the purest, most perfect light you can get. Alright. It is. It's beautiful. Elise and Markus are nearly a thing. Yeah? Yeah nah it does something to women. When they, see you as a hero. I'm really glad he went instead of me. Is that horribly selfish? A little bit. I'm sorry for everything man. Why are you sorry? Oh it's just- it's been full on and, I know you're a sensitive person. - Thanks man. - A sensitive soul. Alright. - Um what time is it? - Nine-ish. I was gonna let you sleep longer, but I started thinking- -Ah, we-we just kissed. We did. Yeah. Cool. I started thinking about what that cop said to you. - About Cannon? - Yeah. We should speak to someone who was there. He became obsessed, with his work. Cannon doesn't ring any bells? I was young. Cannon were around for about a year. - They were a group of young men. - What did they do? Threw eggs, lit grass on fire. Drugs, I think. I remember my mum telling me not to go outside. What happened? They went away. - Just like that? - Yeah. Your dad made sure of it. What do you mean? He um-in the line of duty he shot one of them and killed him. He left a week later. This guy had me on his lap for most of the drive. Kept, patting me. And I could smell petrol. They had glue on my face. I wish I could tell you more. I think it was a gold sedan. Why me? We're wondering that too. They had these speakers- -Juliet told me. The voice said you were an example. Example of what? We don't know. Did Juliet tell you about the party? What party? Ah I told her to, but nah basically we're going ahead - with my party. - Is that wise? They can't resist a party. Wes, where did you get those? They're my dad's. We keep 'em secret. - We'll lure 'em in. - We're not weapon people Wes. You don't have to be weapon people. Yeah I'm- I'm not shooting anyone. You don't have to. But we're defending ourselves against a real threat here. They hurt Markus. Me. They killed Travi. Did you forget what they said they were gonna do to Aster? How do you know? - What? - What they said about Aster? Juliet. Don't press suspicion on me. Like, I get it. But this isn't some cop show. I'm just checking. Good. It's the final act Ben. And they have no idea we're ready for them this time. Bring Team Gold. The more good people we got, the better. - No guns. - Can Libby make it? I'll ask. Let her know. More good people Ben. No guns. It's just been on my mind. You're a crazy man Wes. I know. Hey Ben can you- can you tell Aster I miss her? Okay. Libby misses you. You okay? I'm fine. I'm fine. - When are you coming home? - I'll be there soon Ben. You're acting weird. What's up? I'm-I'm fine, I'm just relaxing. Okay well-we're not gonna stay long tonight, if you're keen. I'm keen yeah. I'll be there. What's going on? I'm just thinking about the other night. You seemed happy. I am happy. I'll be there. I'll be there with Mona. Okay I'll see you then. Ben. Ben! No! No! Peter? Nothing. What now? We use the guns. What are you doing here? Hey Jo. You disappeared. Just like Terry. I've thought a lot about it, and um- I couldn't be what you needed me to be. I wasn't strong enough myself and I was in a bad place. - Me too. - I don't think he bailed. - Peter. - I don't think he bailed. Hello sir. - Wes. - Hey man! - It looks great. - Thanks. - Are you nervous? - No. - Can we talk upstairs? - Sure. And this-this is where the magic happens. - What is it? - Is this a joke? I get it, but this is still a party. - Have you been drinking? - No. - Good. - They've got Libby and Mona. Really? Worst case scenario- We kill those fucking psychos. You're gonna have to teach us. Hey. Don't you think it's weird that nobody else is here yet? Yes and no. Smile. Hey Jules. - I'm sorry about Travi. - Thanks. How's Wes doing? Fine. You right Lew? Do you know where the toilet is? Yeah it's just down the hallway, second door to your - right. - Thanks. This place is huge. Bitch. The recoil's not huge, but it's enough to let you know. It's ready to go. I'm gonna check downstairs. Give us a yell if anything's up. I will. - Sit down. - I'm pacing. Please. What? I want you to be okay. I love you. You too. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I'll be right back. Ben. Guys guys! Guys guys guys, they're here they're here they're here! - Where's Lewis? - Ah ahh- - Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa whoa-whoa-whoa! You guys okay? I'm gonna kill you. It's alright. Did you guess it was me? Did you ever think it was? Just for a second? No? Sit down. Sit down or I'll rip your veins out with my bare hands. You okay? You're hurt. I thought angry maybe... but you've really been betrayed here. We faked it all Aster. Stunt choreography and a good fucking performance. Ben was gonna die. 'Til Markus had more balls than you coming in all knight in shining armour, saving Aster, taking your place. You are a shit boyfriend and a hack my friend. But we had, ah-back up plans. Always got a plan. - Markus? - Ah! Killing Travi was... amazing. And there's this moment, where you can just see their eyes go out. That's gotta be the closest I felt to The Light. Fuck you. You know I will. You wanna know motive? Yeah. It's even better than in my head Ben. Twenty years ago, John Broaden led the original Cannon in reviving this town. Got kicks out of injecting fear everywhere. My dad, was fucked up as me. You know, some people just got something wrong in the head. Something chemical. And the world is mean. So my dad, leads this Cannon gang, 'til your dad, Sergeant Terry Wakeley, shoots my dad in the heart and kills him. You know they should train them in the police force not to aim for the heart. But this is about you and me now. This is about what you got, that I missed out on. Because you were the son of a cop, and I was the son of a criminal. You're insane. The original Cannon, in an act of loyalty, and redemption, and revenge, hacked your dad to death. - That's bullshit. - THAT'S THE BEST PART! NO! NOT BULLSHIT! You wanna ask 'em? It's not-that's not, that's NOT TRUE! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no-no. You can ask them. Yeah. I've got mentors too Ben. They were there for my mum, in some capacity, after my dad died. It really fucked her up. I've got this whole leadership thing down. People see my cause, identify, get hooked on the feeling of finally belonging to something. Finally doing something. It's this... uncanny ability to... bring people together. Thank you. I love it. - I'm sorry. - How could you? - Dean- - What? Aster. These are the people that hurt Markus. Took Libby, and Mona. And what? You're a part of it?! What are you gonna do now Lewis? With your friends? Just gonna-you're just gonna kill your friends, you sick fuck!? Just like Travi. Well you can do it, I don't really care. But you gotta live with it now. You gotta live, with the reminder, that you- Thank you! - Dean! - Get off him. - Any chance we get- - Get 'em off him! - Now. Libby and Mona. - Where are they? Where are they? I'll call them. Hm. Hm. You busy? See. This is perfect. Look at all of us. Look at you, Ben. - Wes. - Yes? I'm sorry this happened to you. I understand how hard it would be. - Aster? You do? - I do. Not having a dad around- - Please don't try and empathise with a psychopath. I don't think you're a psycho. I think you're hurt. I think you're hurting because people wronged you. I don't think you got an easy go in life. I got a fine, go at life. Oh, and Aster... I'm gonna need you to shut your FUCKING DOG MOUTH RIGHT NOW- That felt good Ben. Tie 'em up. Don't struggle! We could take turns making you ugly, breaking your jaw off- But I don't want to do that. No. I got plans. - What did you do to them? - I'm gonna need a couple strong boys to bring all their pieces out for Ben. Nah I'm just kidding. She's fine. - Don't hurt her. - Why? She's as guilty as Ben. The cum of fuckface Terry Wakeley. We're not born free of responsibility Aster. So I don't blame these two. But I hold them accountable. That's fair. I'm gonna slit her wrists. And her throat. Execute her in front of you, we're all gonna feel the last SECOND she's alive for, the last BREATH she takes! Where's Mona? - We hung the bitch. - It's pretty funny. - What? - It's like, she would walk out here, but she was screaming, fighting, talking back, so you know we thought we'd ah... Thought we'd hang the bitch. Ben! Christmas lights make a pretty distraction. I got it! SOMEONE GET ME A KNIFE! It wasn't supposed to go like this. - I'm sorry. - Ben. Wes. Wes. He killed him. Lewis. He killed him. It's your dad's Ben. When he was a cop. - I don't want to kill anymore! - You don't have to. Nobody fuck with me or my friends! It's loaded! Bull shit. I got the good gun. Look what you did. Asshole. Get back to base. And stick together. This story's over. The king's dead. It's over. GO! Lewis you good? - Hey. - Hey. They're still out there. It's Christmas soon. Merry Christmas Dean. Merry Christmas Ben.
