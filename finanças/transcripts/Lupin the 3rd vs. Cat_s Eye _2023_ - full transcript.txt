How very cautious of you to suddenly move up the time of our meeting. I wanted to be safe. Per your instructions, the case can withstand C4 explosives. That was retrieved today just 12 hours ago. And even he couldn't do… Don't underestimate him. He appears out of thin air. Plus, he's a master of disguise. I'll take my leave now. I think you already know that if I show up after this, you know… It's a fake. Isn't that right? Take care of the other one too. Yeah. Leave it to me. He's not supposed to be arriving this early. - [gunfire] - Oh? [grunts] Get your head in the game. There was a story that caught my attention. Yeah? What do you mean, caught your attention? My bad! Lupin the 3rd? Get him! Corner him in the tributary. Don't let him get away! [grunts] [grunts] I guess if you shoot enough bullets, you're bound to hit the target. Jigen, how many are left? Just three. Use 'em wisely. [distant sirens wail] [man] What's going on? INUNARI POLICE [indistinct chattering] This way. Welcome. [indistinct chattering continues] - Mm. - Mm-hm. TONIGHT, YOU WILL SEE A TREASURE ANEI ART GALLERY COLLECTION [man] "Tonight, we come for The Girl and the Flowers." [man 2] I think you're overreacting. We didn't need to kick out all of our party guests. We didn't kick them out. We evacuated them. [grunts] You're splitting hairs. Tax thief. You know, the culprit just might be one of the guests here. Do you not care if your precious treasure is stolen? Hmm! Cat's Eye aren't petty thieves. They're experienced professionals. My gallery is impenetrable! Not even a cat could get in! Even if somehow one does, by the time it gets out, it'll be dead! - [laughs] - Dead? What? What have you done? - Detective Utsumi. - Mmm? We detained an unruly suspect in the parking lot. What? They're making a fuss, saying they work for the building. Just to be safe, could you confirm their story? Oh, all right, fine, I'll do it. My God, you've got to be kidding me. [soft chuckle] [coughing] OK, all set over here, Rui. [Rui] I'm also on schedule. Sending it over, Ai. Got it, got it. - [bleeping] - OK. Let's give it a go, then. [exclaiming] [grunts] What the…? A blackout? Oh, no. I have a feeling it's… It's Cat's Eye! Now, then, let the party begin. [chuckles] Um… Ground squad, attack once you have visual confirmation of the target. Nicely done! The flood gate is… Keep going. Hmm. We'll make a break for it. Yeah, I figured. - [bleeping] - [Ai laughs] Coming loud and clear. Turning on jamming signal right now. This is Utsumi. Hey, anyone! Hey, come in! [static crackles] Damn it. Why can't I get through? [officer] There's a Cat card at the entrance. - What? - [grunts] [officer] All officers, gather at the lobby. Hold on! Wait! - I repeat… - Don't leave your posts! …all officers gather at the first-floor lobby. - It's no use. - Hey! What's going on? What is it? Just shut up. That's exactly what I wanna know! - If it's come to this… - Hmm? [Rui] Search all around the building. [officer] Copy that! Searching now! Everyone on me! All good on this end. - Hitomi. - Copy that. [bleeps] - [man 2] Not even a cat could get in! - [bleeps] But we can, actually. [grunts] THE GIRL AND THE FLOWERS - [Hitomi] Dad. - [Rui] Sounds like you're in. Well, then, I'll see you at the rendezvous point as scheduled. Oh? What? Really? Hitomi, Toshi is headed your way! [Rui] Did he climb the elevator shaft? I wouldn't put it past him. Idiot! I thought the suspect was in the basement parking lot! That was bogus from the start. - Their target is actually the gallery. - Ah! Well, then, get climbing already. Damn slowpoke! Oh! Oh! Damn it. Just you wait, Cats! SAITAMA PREFECTURAL POLICE Hmm! Whoa! The place is crawling with cops. Well done. Well done. Is that Zenigata? - He invited him. - What? Lupin! I'm gonna rap you this time! [Lupin] See you, Pops! Take care of the rest for me! [grunts] Huh? Hey, you there! Stop right now! - Floor it. - Yes, sir. [yelps] [yelling] Love you, Pops! Mean it! Mwah! Stop! Get back here, Lupin! Hurry up, before we lose sight of him. [grunting] You guys are… under arrest! - There they are. - Then shoot. It's no use! They won't stop! Give it here. [soft chuckle] Get the painting back. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Is it a fireproof case? The sensors aren't picking up anything. [clunks] Huh? [yells] - [Rui] What is it? - [Ai] Hitomi? [yells] [Hitomi] You're kidding me. [sighs] [grunts] Uh? [grunts] [grunts] [sighs] That was a dirty little trick. Sis! Hitomi! [Hitomi] I got it. I got the target. Oh, thank God. It's too early to celebrate. - Let's meet up, just in case. - Copy. - Oh! - Special move. Flying handcuffs! - Ah! - [chuckles] - That's as far as you go, Cat. - [grunts] This is thanks to me practising a move from a detective I admire. Now, surrender. - Hitomi? - Sis! [grunting] [grunts] All right, now. Let's have a look at your face! Hmm? What's this? [siren wails] - [yells] - [grunts, yells] [groans] Perv! [grunts] - [sighs] - Hey, sis. You OK? [Hitomi] I slapped him really hard. Toshio isn't the type to be discouraged by something like this. [grunts] OK, let's hurry. Please rest assured, we recovered the painting. [man] And the thieves? It's been handled. You must be relieved, Dennis. You almost sullied your father's good name. [splutters] Deliver the painting to France. Understood? [Dennis] Understood. [bleeps] Hmm. [phone rings] - [phone bleeps] - What's wrong? Did Lupin interfere? Sounds like I was right. Taken care of? I see. Yes. Leave this one to me. I'll get it done before it gets to the museum. What a fool. There's no way Lupin would die that easily. OK, go ahead. Put them in the vault. [gasps] [engine approaches] [tyres screech] Hey, you OK, Lupin? Of course I'm not OK. Busting out something like that. They're more dangerous than I heard. [Jigen] But you managed to make the switch? Yeah. That should buy us some extra time. Hmm. So you mean to tell me this is one of the three pieces? Michael Heinz's The Girl and the Flower. [Jigen] Nice. You have any leads on the other two pieces? Yeah. Some cats should have taken the second one right about now. - Cats? - [Zenigata, over loudspeaker] Lupin! - Uh-oh. - Lupin, Lupin, Lupin! - [Lupin] Hey, it's Pops! - Give yourself up peacefully! [Jigen] He's a tough cookie. I could fool the others easy, but nothing ever gets past Pops. [tyres screech] Pops! Thanks for your help with this one. - Catch ya later! - Lupin! Hey, wait! [grunts] Get… Get back here, Lupin! What are you sleeping for, tax thief? Ow… Ow, ow, ow, ow. [grunts] It's me! Open up! What? [grunts] [groans] Oh, God, they got it! [sobs] The Cats are over there! [officer] After 'em! Don't lose them! Hey. Let's go see some fireworks. - Heck, yeah! - Mm-hm! [Ai] All right, let's go! [theme music playing] [newsreader] Around 7 p.m. last night, an art heist took place at the Anei insurance building in Shinjuku. The stolen art piece was The Girl and the Flower… - [groans] - …by German artist Michael Heinz. God, please turn off the TV. The police have concluded that it was carried out by Cat's Eye… Dang. Looks like they put you through the ringer. They grilled me for three hours. They said the next time I let the Cats slip away, I'll be demoted. Well, I'll help you move if so. Huh! You sure know how to rub it in. I think you should just ask to be put on a different assignment. No way! Arresting the Cats is my calling. I'll do whatever it takes to catch those girls. After all, I have to impress you, Hitomi. Oh, Toshio! - Toshio, you're so bold. - [sighs] - [door opens] - [all] Huh? Welcome. - Hmm? - Uh, you can just sit anywhere. Please, allow me to introduce myself. Uh… Heinrich Berger. Oh. An art dealer? I'm here to talk about your father's painting. Wha…? I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean. It's a matter I can only discuss with Cat's Eye. - [grunts] - Huh? - Uh… - Hmm? Mmm? Important business to discuss, my ass! Who kicks out their own customers? Hmm? Such a gentle flavour. It reminds me of Herr Heinz. No need to be so cautious. I have absolutely no intention of exposing your identities. Who are you? I doubt you would remember me. Because you and Hitomi were only about this tall back then. - We met when…? - We were children? Yes. However, this is my very first time meeting Ai. You have your mother's eyes. What? I do? - You know our father, mister? - Ai. I owe him my life. That's because it was Herr Heinz who gave this unknown art dealer a chance in the art world. Where did he disappear to? If possible, I would like to repay my debt to him. If I can somehow figure out where he disappeared to. So what brings you here today? I've searched 17 years for your father's works, scattered all throughout this enormous world. I didn't care how seemingly small or insignificant of a lead it was. That's just like us, sir. And I came across this painting the other day. - [gasps] - [Ai] Is that Rui? [Hitomi] They were a series? Indeed, yes. - Do you have this piece? - No, another dealer does. I meant to ask for more details, but I suddenly lost contact. When I tried tracking him down, well, I… I found out that the piece was stolen from him and he was murdered. By the hands of a certain thief. By a certain thief? Lupin the 3rd. - [all gasp] - [bleeping] Huh? What? [Rui] Toshio? What's he doing there? Oh. Give us a break already. I don't know this Lupin or Anpan or whatever. [Rui] But why is he after my father's work? Because this series contains a special map to a hidden treasure that's been sought after by the Nazis. - [gasps] - Wait a minute. Why? Why is that in Dad's painting? Even I don't know exactly who, why or when the map was hidden. What? I had thought that they were only rumours shared between certain art dealers. Until I learned that the dealer who possessed this painting was killed. Killed? To tell you the truth, this is not the first time Lupin targeted one of Herr Heinz's works. What do you mean? Herr Heinz was actively working to recover artworks that were stolen by the Nazis. You already know about this, correct? Yes. Mr Nagaishi told us. Someone was helping him with that work. - Who? - It was none other… than Lupin. [gasps] [Berger] Fight poison with poison. It was a bitter decision, but Herr Heinz hired Lupin to recover the artworks. Huh? No way. [Rui] I can't imagine Lupin offering his help for free. No, of course not. The Heinz Collection. He was after Dad's paintings from the start. Lupin pretended to help Herr Heinz, only to betray him and leak his information to criminals. As a result, Herr Heinz was forced to go on the run, and much of the Heinz Collection was taken by Lupin. And now, well, he is coming after this series. I understand the story. But why are you here? I wanted to warn you. It is highly likely that Lupin will try to approach you soon. And more than anything, I simply can't forgive him. Herr Heinz's pure and noble artworks are now in serious danger of being used for nefarious purposes. How could I forgive such an act? How dare they tarnish Dad's works! So, please, just keep your guard up. He's not just dangerous, he's a master of disguise. Be wary of anyone you know. All right? [door opens] Hey, girls! - Huh? - [gasps] [Hitomi] Toshi? This is quite the underground base, but I was able to break in so easily. That's a fatal flaw for a thief. Toshi. If I were the detective, this would be the end for you. [gasps] Who are you? Spill it! Does it matter? Regardless, back off from these paintings. But why? You know they say curiosity killed the cat. The Cats… don't die! [grunts] You've got a pretty good aim, but I'm sorry. I wasn't aiming for you. Hmm? [yells] Hot! - [gunshot] - [yells] [grunts] Phew! How dangerous. How dangerous. I mistook you for a kitten, but it seems I was wrong. Lupin the 3rd. So, all three are here. If you already know about me, then this will go faster than I thought. I don't have time to mess around. - You're going to let me pass. - You're crazy. Give us back the painting, you thief! [gunshot] Ai! We're all thieves, aren't we? Cats should lie curled up inside a kotatsu. Not quite the right season, though. - Hmm. - [gasps] I said I'm not messing around. Toodles! Are you guys all right? - Yes. - I'm sorry. - My legs froze with fear. - [Rui] I understand. - We have to go get it back! - Hold on. - What? - [Berger] Hmm. Mr Berger is right. He's too dangerous. But there's another one. One more painting. - What? - One more painting? It was a… series of three? Jeez. What the heck, man? Just one look at me and… Uh… A trench coat in this damn heat? [gasps] That man is… It's actually you! I'm Detective Toshio Utsumi with the Inunari Precinct. - I'm honoured to meet one of my heroes. - Mmm. What brings you here to Inunari Precinct? Are you familiar with the name Lupin the 3rd? Isn't he, like, a world-renowned thief? Yeah, and I was recently sent from Interpol to go after the bastard. Hmm? Which means… Last night's incident in Sumida River involved Lupin. Huh? Huh? [Toshio] It's just like the piece stolen by the Cats. Cat's Eye and Lupin obtained identical paintings at the exact same time. - It can't be a coincidence. - Wow! That means that I get to join an international investigation? But there's a fully armed extremist organisation after them. It's safe to assume that they're all somehow closely related. So if we go after them, they'll lead us to the Cats and Lupin. Yeah. But, however, I'm getting strange pressure from the top brass. - Pressure? - To not press this matter too much. Huh! Well, that's just ridiculous. - Completely preposterous. - Yeah, exactly. Doesn't it stir your blood as a policeman? Of course! We will expose this organisation and grab Lupin and the Cats by their tails. Will you help me? I will follow you anywhere, sir. You're a true detective, my friend. Hmm! By the way, Atami… It's Utsumi. Regarding the incident yesterday, they got away totally clean, despite the extra security. - Yeah? - Who was in command over there? I have something to say. Oh, uh… I wonder who that could have been. Uh… Thanks to you, we could get a flight right away. In this situation, time is of the essence. I bet the third painting is of me. It would be wasted on Lupin! [laughs] You weren't even born yet, Ai. We won't know until we see it. Yes, I believe that you're correct. - I am? - Yes, I believe so, Ai. Herr Heinz was very much looking forward to your birth. Right? I think you and I really get each other. Miss, the documents are ready to go. Thanks, Mr Nagaishi. I suppose it would be pointless to try and stop you now? This item is not only sought by Lupin, but militaries all around the world are fully aware of this item's existence. I understand the dangers. We'll steal the third piece first and stop Lupin. I can't allow my father's art to be used for evil. Please, just be careful, OK? These are from Mr Nagaishi. [Hitomi] So this is the target? Stealing from a train is super easy! Not this time. [all] Hmm? [Rui] It's no ordinary cargo train. Are they all armed soldiers? It's a military train. [Berger] Oh, that's troublesome. [Rui] Yes, and there are military guards as well. They make a long stop at this station. - We can sneak in here. - [squeals] Oh, man, I'm getting so excited! Is there anything I can do? Just stand by and, um, be ready to take off at any given time. This is gonna be a piece of cake for us! - Hmm. - [soft chuckle] Very well. I wish you the best of luck. Hmm. [Jigen] What the hell? What's up, Jigen? Just look for yourself, man. Ooh. Oh, my! It's Fujiko! Look time no see! Look time no see, my ass. Lupin, what's going on here? Of course Fujiko would be after the treasure. Have you gotten us into some kind of crazy trouble again, Lupin? Trouble? What do you mean? You said we'd find the location of the damn treasure once we get all three paintings. But what exactly is this treasure, huh? Like I said, it's your average, run-of-the-mill Nazi treasure. - So you won't say exactly. - Hmm? Does it have to do with women? You've got it all wrong, Goemon. [Goemon] It's always women. Not just any woman. It's Fujiko of all people! She's nothing but trouble. I'm out of here. Hey, come on! You can't just leave after coming this far. - See you later, Lupin. - Hey! Hold up! - Hey! - [Jigen] Later! Fine. Go. I'll do this on my own. Hmm. [low grunt] [groans] [sighs] As expected, this is hard. Our only lead so far is this vague symbol. Investigations are all about the guts! We gotta keep at it! [sighs] Are you for real? There isn't any time for whining, Atami. - Utsumi. - [grunts] [sighs] I'll go make some coffee. [yells] Whoa! What was that? We have an emergency! We have an emergency! Stop the train! Hey! Can't you hear me? Stop the train now! What are you doing? OK, Hitomi and Ai, now it's your turn. Hurry up! Move! - What is it? - Apparently explosives. Run! Run! Hurry! - Identify yourself! Stop! - Shoot! Go! Shoot! Keep shooting! An intruder in the back of the car. - Send backup! - Don't let 'em get away! Catch 'em! They're here. Just like we planned. [Dennis] Continue monitoring them. Copy that. The Cats are fine. The real problem is Lupin. [grunts] There we go. All set. - [soldier] They have to be here. - [Ai] How are you doing, Hitomi? - [soldier] Corner them up ahead. - I was able to draw them over. I'm heading to you now. [grunts] [soldier] Hey, in front! [Rui] We're almost in the tunnel. Hurry, you two! Time to book it, girls. - [soldier] Stop! - [gunfire] Let's go! Ai! Go for it! Copy that. [grunts] Hitomi! [yells] [both yell] That was a close one. [gunfire] [explosion] [tyres screech] [grunts] - [Goemon] Are you worried? - Huh? Please. As if. It is not too late. [grunts] I can't find anything. How about we take a break, sir? [yawns] [grunts] - Hey, Atami. - Utsumi, sir. - What's that? - Huh? Ah. Oh, this. I thought we need to relax. Relax? Jeez! Damn you! - And you call yourself a detective, hmm? - Huh? [Toshio] Could it be? Hmm? Hmm? Hmm? Hmm? Hmm? Oh! Isn't that this? [Zenigata] A far-right protest in Germany. - What's the big deal? - No, not that. Here! [Zenigata] Hmm… Huh? Hmm! [laughs] This is it! Good work there, Atami. It's Utsumi. Bye-bye! We did it. A huge success. It was pretty close, though. Don't worry about that. Now, let's open the vault and get the painting of me. [Lupin] Man! Can't you two steal a little more quietly? - [both gasp] - You guys are real alley cats. Sorry, but I took the painting. Give me back my painting, Lupin! [gasps] Damn. Hmm. [soft chuckle] I told you to back off from this. You should listen to your elders. Hey, that's enough. We know what it is you're after. Our father was forced to go on the run because you betrayed him! I don't know who's been filling your head with nonsense. Lupin! Come on, you really shouldn't abandon your post so easily. - That's exactly what Fujiko wants. - [both] Hmm? We don't have time to be fighting each other. - What are you saying? - [thudding] [brakes squeal] [helicopter blades whir] [Fujiko] They're in the storage car. We'll send soldiers. And you go too. [Toshio] Faden? Officially, they're an international art dealing syndicate. But their true identity is… Wait. Arms dealers? So, are they warmongers? Arms deals always move a ridiculous amount of capital. They're not in a position to just openly send money through the bank. [Toshio] So they use art in place of actual money? If they have two paintings at five billion apiece, they can make a ten-billion-yen deal. Art is an extremely important payment method to these people. So, these paintings are connected to illegal deals, then. Hmm. My guess is that they are, but something's not adding up. I can't imagine that these paintings are really worth that much. There's something else to it. - That's what you're saying? - Yeah. There's a cargo plane crash in Siberia with many art pieces still missing, a gallery targeted by Cat's Eye, and an art dealing syndicate with a dark reputation. What if they're all connected? Lupin is up against a formidable foe. They're pretty dangerous, I'd say, for the Cats as well. Mmm. We'll go back to basics and do some legwork. - What? - We're flying to Europe. Europe? Wait, what? According to ICPO documents, Faden has offices in Paris, in London, Berlin and Bucharest. Uh, but it's not like we'll find clues right away if we go. Huh. Now that the case in the Sumida River is linked to international terrorism, I'll force an ICPO investigation on them. You're bound to find some dirt if you just dig deep enough. Dirt, huh? Lupin and the Cats will get tangled up with Faden. Damn, my instincts are tingling right now. Let's go, Atami. Um, well, it's Utsumi. [sighs] Am I supposed to clean all this stuff up by myself? Huh? What? These guys are…? They're allies of Lupin. Don't include me in with him. Too bad, Lupin, too bad. I'm the one who has the painting, Fujiko. Haven't you learned that my way is much more efficient? What do you mean? Hand it over peacefully and I won't hurt your little kittens. OK, fine. - My painting! - Don't move! Stop! - Ai, please calm down. - But why? Just keep quiet. - Mm-hm. - But what about the other two? Does it look like I carry them around? Not the paintings. You've already taken them out, right? The stones, Lupin. Stones? Come on, Fuji-cakes. You don't think I'll shoot you? [all gasp] Now, look, you're going way off script, Fujiko. [Fujiko] What? What are you talking about? You make a great actress, but you're being a little too scary. Actress? I mean, I'm willing to play along. For old times' sake. Oh! Enough with the bull crap! - [Lupin] Oh, so scary. - What? They're friends? - [Fujiko] Shut up! - Guess so. - Please spare my life! - I'll really shoot you, Lupin! - [Lupin] Please be gentle. - Mr Dennis? Yeah, I hear it. We have the painting. Now capture them as planned. - [soldier] And Fujiko? - We're done with her. Well, now you've done it, Lupin! - [grunts] - [gasps] [chuckles] Right on time. [Dennis] Quick, all units pull up! Fire! Take 'em out! Grab on! [yelling] Evade! Pull back! Damn it! [tyres screech] Well, you're on your own. [Jigen] Hurry, Lupin! We can't stay here for much longer. Hurry up and climb! But the painting! Let's go! Rui! - What? Who are you broads? - Hurry, you two! [Lupin] Come on already! [Ai yells] I'll get the painting. Move close to the train! Ai! Hurry up! What are you doing? Get up here already! [grunts] - [thudding] - [yelps] [gasps] It's not a painting of me? [whimpers] [yells] [yells] But why? [thudding] Jigen! Go on ahead! Ai! Huh? Do not worry. Lupin will have to take care of it. We gotta worry about ourselves instead! [Dennis] Take them out! - Don't let them live. - [soldier] Copy that. [grunts] [Ai yells] This is real bad. Hitomi! [grunts] This is it! Lupin! [whimpers] Is he…? - [grunts] - [Ai screams] The fool. After them. Take us lower. [crashing] - [thudding] - [groans] [Lupin grunts] Hide. [both grunt] [helicopter blades whir] - Get through the forest. - Huh? You'll come to a path… if you head directly southwest. Hurry. But… Go already. [sighs] Mmm? [grunts] What? Just go already. There's medicine in this. Hmm? Oh… [grunts] What? Can you not see? [man] And… - [bleep] - …what of Lupin? [Dennis] We're currently searching for him. Don't kill him until we get the stones. Yes, sir. [Dennis] There's still the matter of Fujiko. [man] She doesn't matter. All within expectations. - [bleeps] - [groans] [Ai] I stopped the bleeding. I'm fine. You can go. I can't leave with your eyes like that. This is from the impact. It's just temporary. - So, why? - Huh? Why did you help me? [soft chuckle] Can't have a kid like you dying in front of me. But you threatened us with a gun the other day. This all happened because you didn't listen to what I told you earlier. Does that mean you did it to protect us? Would you just… forget about that? We should get through the forest while we can. - Hey, Lupin. - Huh? That organisation, why are they after Dad's art? And it seemed like they knew that you would save us. That's weird. Would you please just tell me what's going on? [chuckles] The organisation is called Faden. Faden? [Lupin] They use artwork as currency to trade valuable weapons. That's not all. They were involved with the Nazi looting of artworks during the war. - What? Then… - Yeah. I worked with your dad many years ago. I know. You were taking back art that was stolen by the Nazis. That's right. They were all difficult jobs. I mean, it all worked out for me, as I was just starting out and was still pretty green. All except that one day. - [tyres screech] - [gunfire] [Ai] Did you fail? [Lupin] You could say that. The treasure we stole was too hot. I had to swim for my life, and Heinz saved me. Talk about fate. First your dad takes care of me, and now you. Well, what did you steal? A gemstone? [Lupin] The Stones of Fortuna. The legendary stones that bring glory to those who enter into a contract with them. Glory? They say they can grant your deepest wish. What? Seriously? No way. - [helicopter blades whir] - Hmm? Huh? Hang on. In any case, once I could, I delivered the three stones I stole to your dad. [Ai] And he put them in his series of paintings? [Lupin] That's right. Your dad was planning on using them as negotiation chips to get back the stolen artworks from the Nazis. If the legends were true about the contract with the stones, giving them to a great person would bring everlasting peace to the world. At least, that's what he mentioned. Your dad was a real romantic. Father… Well, not that a great person like that exists. Hey, don't insult my father! It was a compliment. - All right, then I'll forgive you. - [chuckles] [sighs] - But I'm… glad. - Hmm? To know that you're not actually a bad guy. - That you didn't betray my dad. - Huh? - Hey, you… - Not "you". My name is Ai. Ai… who told you that? - That I betrayed him? - Wha…? - Who told you? - Um, it was… [rustling] Hide-and-seek is over, Lupin. It's payback time for everything you've put us through. OK, Mr Berger. We'll meet at the rendezvous. - [Hitomi] Ai is… - Uh… Ai is OK, right? I sure hope so. So, you mean to say you don't know why Lupin saved you? Is that what you're telling us? - Yeah. - We have no clue. Mm-hm. Interesting. Perhaps an obligation. - [motorbike engine revs] - Uh-oh. The jinx is here now, guys. What do you want? Lupin was captured by Faden. - And the kitten too. - Ai! - Do you know where? - Paris. At their offices. Well, how awfully kind of you. What is it you're after? Neither of us can go home empty-handed. The guy in the helicopter was Dennis Kirchmann. What? [Fujiko] I'd hurry if I were you. Kirchmann. It's no wonder they're reckless. This is not gonna be easy. Hmm? What's this? [Goemon] Lupin pushed it on us. [Jigen] I think I'm seeing the big picture. [Berger] Lupin helped you? Yeah. I can't believe it. - Mr Nagaishi. - Hmm… - Something terrible has happened. - But why? Why would he help you? I don't know any of the details offhand, but the bastard slipped this on me. Hmm. - Wait a minute. It can't be. - A gemstone? This thing was hidden inside the painting. It must be important. - The Stone of Fortuna. - Hmm? A gem said to have been pursued by the Nazis. [Jigen] This is smelling more like trouble to me. I know what it is that Faden is after. [Nagaishi] It seems that way. I'll do some more research on my end. Yes. Thank you. So, how are we going to break in? Mr Nagaishi will look into the details of the building. There must be a way in there. But they're arms dealers. How about we just play dumb and knock on the front door? I might be able to get myself in without raising any suspicion. [Jigen] Mmm? I've fostered a good relationship with our art dealings in the past. It's too dangerous. We can't ask you to do that. Please, let me. I'm the one who brought this mess to you in the first place. Please, allow me to help however I can. Mmm. Mmm. Thank you. Really. Thank you, Mr Berger. [grunts] Leave it to me. [phone rings] [man] This is the underground workshop. [Dennis] It's me. Where's the Stone of Fortuna? The extraction will be completed shortly. Have the stone polished. What about the painting? It's also a valuable product. Then we'll place it in the vault after. [screaming] Oh, God, stop it! Lupin, are you OK? Spill it already. Where are you keeping the other stone? [grunts] [Lupin] I wonder. I knew this was a waste of time. If you had just talked, this girl wouldn't have had to be harmed. Huh? We made sure to keep both of you alive. Why do you think we went through all that trouble? [Lupin] Dennis Kirchmann. You are a famous mercenary. And I'm surprised to see a man like you so dedicated to collecting rocks. What's your point? Did you know the rumours of the curse that follow the Stones of Fortuna? [sighs] Those stones have granted power and knowledge to rulers for generations. King Attila, Francisco Pizarro, Napoleon and Hitler. Also, the first boss and founder of Faden, Herr Rudolf von Jaeger. None of them had what you'd call peaceful deaths. As soon as they lost the stones, it was a direct path to destruction. No, he did not have a peaceful death. Hmm? I saw it with my own eyes. Rudolf von Jaeger was my father. [gasps] If people knew I was the son of the first boss, I would have been killed. [electricity hums] Because killing a 14-year-old boy and taking his fortune would be all too simple for the syndicate. That's why I called myself Kirchmann. Are you done buying time? My father wouldn't have died if you hadn't stolen the stones. Then finish me now. You can have your revenge. [chuckles] Don't get the wrong idea. My revenge won't be the one that's so kind. First I'll torture the girl and get you to reveal the stone's location. [Lupin] Wait! We're not done talking! My revenge will come after. - I'll take my time. - [Lupin] Don't! - [whimpers] - Dennis! - [phone rings] - Hmm? [soldier] Yes? - Yes, sir. - [whimpers] Sir, we have visitors. Visitors? [soldier] Two men claiming to be from Interpol. [grunts] I'll handle it. - And these two? - Continue. Yes, sir. [door closes] Oh! Finally, man. Now, then, since Zenigata is here an' all, I guess we should split. - Hey, don't move! Don't move! - [Lupin] Ai, where are the lights? - Huh? - [soldier] Shut up, Lupin! - A bit further back. - You too! You wanna get shot? Huh? You bastard! - Lupin! - [gunshots] [grunting] [soldier yells] Lupin, where are you? - Where did you go? - [door opens] [gasps] Lupin! Can you see? I see much better in the dark. I'm a thief after all. What? For real? - We'd better get going. - Where to? Isn't it obvious? Yeah. [chuckles] Wait! Hold up! Lupin! We're almost there. We're entering Faden's territory. I'm turning off comms. [Hitomi] Copy that. All the key players are here now. [Toshio] Um… sir? Mmm? Is it really OK that we're on our own? - Why put Faden on alert? - [sighs] [Dennis] I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I'm the manager, Kirchmann. I'm Zenigata, with Interpol. I'm Utsumi, with police. There was a terrorist bombing in Tokyo's Sumida River the other day. Terrorist bombing? This artwork seems to be somehow linked to the incident in question. Huh. Our investigation found they were being dealt to your company. [footsteps approach] Sir? You have a call. Pardon me. I'm terribly sorry. We apologise for just dropping in. Sorry to keep you. Excuse me, where's the bathroom? Sure. Right this way. Yes, sir. Then the last stone is here? [Toshio] But he just went to the bathroom. [Dennis] As for the art, it's going as planned. Could you take your leave for today? What? Whoa, wait a minute. It seems a client we had scheduled has just come in. I'm terribly sorry, sir. You can't do that to us, miss! We just flew all the way to France overnight. We're not just gonna up and leave now. - [Zenigata] We're leaving, Atami. - What? Are you sure, sir? We'll come back later. But… We have all the stones. - Let's prepare for the ritual at once. - [door closes] Are we leaving for real? I managed to take a good look around inside. Let's go, Atami. Hold on. Sir! Where exactly are we going? [Zenigata] To the back entrance, obviously. - [Toshio] No way! - Toshi? [Zenigata] If you understand, just follow me. - [Toshio] I understand. - Don't worry. I have an idea. Lupin drew them all here. - We gotta tell them. - Do not. Why? Securing an escape route is an important role. Ai… [grunts] All right, let's start digging for some dirt, kid. But… But… Isn't this a bad idea? I'm not gonna force you. - You can leave. - [grunts] I'm coming. I am coming! [Berger] I don't see them anywhere. There was barely any security on our way too. If he escaped, I'd expect to see a signal pretty soon. This is the only room with the camera down. - [gasps] - Hey, man. You sure got some damn sharp eyeballs for an art dealer. Yes, well, observation's a big part of my job after all. - Let's go. - Right. Listen, once we get through the catacombs, we'll reach the ritual room. Memorise every nook and every cranny from here on out. Every nook and cranny? Their number and positions, the types of weapons. Instantaneously commit them all to memory. Ugh! That, my friend, is the mark of a great thief. I can't possibly remember all that. If you can't, I'll just go on alone. Isn't that right, Fujiko? - [Ai] Huh? - Looks like you're late, Lupin. A secret path? I've been undercover for six months. - [Lupin] This is perfect. - I'm not helping you. Hey, come on, don't be so frosty. That treasure you're looking for is behind the aqueduct down below. - So you found it? - Yes, ma'am. I found it when I came to set this baby up. [sighs] You're gonna make another huge mess. What do you want out of it? Things might get a little bit hairy from here. - When that happens… - Mmm? I see. - All right. - Hmm. I knew that you'd come through. So, we got a deal? Hmm? - [Fujiko] Fine. - You don't need the treasure's location? [Fujiko] I know it's the usual mark. Huh. Lupin, what's going on? - I need a favour. - Huh? I'd be letting your old man down if I let something happen to you. So, if things get dangerous, run. That's totally unfair and one-sided! I wanna get my dad's art back too, Lupin. Don't you worry. I'll get them back, no matter what. Because a truly great thief always sees the job through to the finish line. Always, huh? Yeah. Always, my friend. Do you pinky swear? Yeah. Pinky swear. Hey, dude, this is mine! [soldier] Hurry! They're down below! Assemble with the boss. What's with the sudden commotion? They're all headed that way. Now's our chance. Let's go. Wait, what? Isn't this illegal? Just help me look, kid. There's something here. Every single room just has wooden boxes inside them. Hmm? Oh! Hey, sir, over here! What is it? Huh. We finally have something. What are all these documents? The… These are… What the heck do they say? Can't read 'em. Huh? However I do smell something fishy. - [grunts] - Hey, hold on, sir. This is destruction of property on top of breaking and entering. [Zenigata grunts] Look! We went digging and we've found the dirt. Oh. So this has gotta be a ledger. But are the Cats going to be OK up against people like this? I knew they knew we were here. It's possible that they found the others. Or maybe there is a mole. [gasps] It can't be. Hmm? It seems pretty clear that Ai was in here at some point. - What do we do? - What the…? You were too slow to realise it. First off, put down your weapon, Daisuke Jigen. [Jigen] So, you had a trap set for us, huh? [Dennis] Slowly. [Jigen] OK, OK. You have the stone, don't you? Hand it over. What do you mean? [gunshot] [Jigen] I'll give you the stone. Don't do anything stupid. Don't worry, I won't. Have that man there bring it to me. Mmm? So it's you? Perhaps we should follow his instructions here. Mmm? Mr Berger? [Berger laughs] And what happened with Lupin? I'm terribly sorry. He got away. You have allowed him to slip twice. You've dishonoured your father's name yet again. What's going on? I had a feeling this guy was shady. But I never imagined he'd be the syndicate's big boss. Go and get the third painting ready at once. Lupin will definitely come to disrupt the ritual. Are they bait? I think the remaining two Cats will likely show up as well. That painting is the best one out of the three of them. Do not scratch it. - You tricked us? - Go on. - Yes, sir. - Answer me, Berger! Stop it! Do you wanna get killed? [Berger laughs] Yes, it is true that I used to deal with your father, Michael Heinz, as an art dealer. He trusted me completely until the very end. That man was truly easy to manipulate. - [laughs] - He'll pay for this. How dare he use our father's art! Hands up and get against the wall! Look at all this. Isn't this enough evidence for us? It seems like it is. - No. There should be more. - [groans] - Oh! - You two are still sniffing around? Uh, well, uh… Don't move! There's a hundred Interpol officers surrounding the entire building above. - Alert! - [Toshio] Yeah, you're surrounded! - Toshio? - It's time to retreat. If we were going to run, we shouldn't have done this in the first place! - Now, damn it. Run! - Fire! After them! - [soldier 1] Go check it out! - [soldier 2] On it! Huh? [coughing] Damn it. Bring me an RPG, now. - I'll handle them here. You go. - [grunts] Now! Go! Yikes. Oh, crap. Gotcha. - I got this. - Thank you. - Impossible. - Why can't we hit him? [soldiers grunt] - Fall back! - Make way! Fire! [grunts] [yells] [Rui] Hitomi. Rui. I'm glad you got through. Turns out there's a mole. Yeah. Berger had us completely fooled. [Hitomi] You were also attacked? I'm following Ai's signal. You should head there too. - Someone's coming. - Who is it? Can you see? No, it's too dark to see anything. [gasps] Mr Berger. - Quiet. - Mmm. Hmm. Lupin! I know you're here. Come on out. Come, celebrate the birth of a new ruler. - Hmm! - Hmm? - I guess you know if I'm here. - Huh? Mmm. Just as I suspected. Mr Berger, what about my sisters? Mmm? Ah, you mean those ladies, huh? - By now, I suppose… - [bleeps] [deeper voice] …your sisters might have entered eternal rest. Huh? What? A voice changer. Ha! Surprised, are we? I borrowed Michael's voice in order to lower your guard. [chuckles] How dare you trick us! Damn scoundrel! What an impressive performance. You must frequently hide the fact that you're the big boss. Well, there certainly are others after this seat. Hmm. So I guess it was you who framed the previous boss after all. [chuckles] What are we gonna do, Lupin? - Ai? - Mm-hm. You remember the promise you made if things get bad? Uh… Yeah. Good. Don't forget it. Yo, Berg-man. I'm willing to help you out. Ha! Are you failing to understand your situation? You know what this thing is? What are you doing? It's a detonator, buddy. For right where you're standing. The moment I stole those stones, I knew that the next boss would perform the ritual. You're bluffing! Well, I guess that's possible. Wanna try me? [grunts] Setting off that device will take the entire room down, and you'll be buried alive too. [laughs] I think we'll manage. You'll be the one who's buried in here, with the stones. Hmm. What is it that you want? You know exactly what I want. Give me Michael's paintings and never go near Cat's Eye again. Is that all? Yep. You can have the stones. [soldier] Mr Berger, the paintings are ready. [chuckles] Those are agreeable terms. Good. Then we have a deal. Hand over the paintings. Paintings? - If you want them… - Huh? My painting! Stop! It's a trap! It seems the tables have turned, Lupin. [tuts] That damn Dennis. Now, let's drop that detonator, shall we? [Ai yelps] Stop! Hurry it up. Do it if you care about this girl's life. Lupin, I'm sorry. [groans] Well, you leave me no other choice. Lupin! That's enough! Lupin! Hmm! Mr Berger, you're awful. Why are you doing this? You're exactly like your father. You're both so wonderfully naive. [groans] Thank you for letting me enjoy this. I will let you die after seeing the ritual take place. Oh. It must be here. [grunts] Oh, so it turns out that the Nazis had actually looted this piece. Then the one in the Louvre isn't real? [Berger] Through this contract with the stones, the previous boss obtained great fortune and power. The poverty-stricken young man who lost everything to war has made it this far once and for all. Ah! [gasps] [chuckles] [laughs] I have finally made the sacred pact with these precious stones all by myself. - [Heinz] Berger. - Huh? So, this is what you were truly after all along. That voice is… How? How could you be here? [grunts] [Heinz] How very disappointing, Berger. It was all a lie. All so that we would steal the Stones of Fortuna. [growls] Is that why you told me about the stones? No. There's no way that you're here right now. You went off the grid when the syndicate came after you. [Heinz] If the stone's legend is true, the previous boss should have perished after losing the stones. - [grunts] - [sighs] You did it so that you could replace him as boss. Replace him as boss? It wasn't something as trivial as that. The previous boss wasn't using the stones to their true potential. I will obtain a much greater power than they ever could have achieved. What can you do now? Tell me, Michael Heinz. [gasps] Father! Where are you? Where are you? You be quiet, girl. There's nothing Michael can do for you now. Dennis, find out where he is. Take him out, and his daughter as well. So the one who betrayed the last boss and had Lupin steal the stones was you all along, wasn't it? [grunts] No, wait, please! Do you know how my father died? It was a truly atrocious death. So much so that my mother actually fainted when she saw his body. Wait, wait! No! If you kill me, the new boss, you'll be hunted down and killed by the syndicate. - [distant laughter] - Huh? [Heinz's voice] I'm extremely disappointed in you, Berger. [Lupin] You've been making false claims to anyone who'd listen. Lupin! Are you OK, Lupin? Kirchmann, listen, we… We just wanna recover Heinz's artwork. That's it. We've got nothing to do with each other, right? So how's about you just let us go this time? I suppose I owe you one for revealing the truth. Although Berger wasn't the only one responsible for my father's death. [groans] [Dennis] You're also guilty of stealing the Stones of Fortuna from him. Oh, man. I've stalled for as long as I can. Cats. [Dennis] I don't give a damn who becomes the next boss. - Ai. - I can't allow her to live. - [gasps] - [grunts] I will have all three of you… die. Here and now! Huh? Calm down, men. It's just the Cats. Send soldiers down to this level. [grunts] I am not forfeiting the Stones of Fortuna to anyone! Rui! Hitomi? - I'm glad you're OK. - Ai. Gosh, you really had us worried there. Sorry. We're together now. - OK, time to run. - All right. We have to hurry, while the smoke is still up. [soldier] Meet up with the units from the second floor. [Dennis] Hurry. Go. Hitomi. What weapons do you have left? Just these. - How about you? - Same here. Well, we are gonna need more than cards. -[static crackles] -[Lupin] Cats. Can you hear me? - Impossible. - Lupin? You think you can relay what I'm about to say to Ai? [Ai] Yeah. OK. Ai, Lupin has a message for you. Message? He says to use the card he gave you. [Rui] The one that's a mark of a thief. Do you know what he means? The mark of a thief. [Ai] Sisters, I've got an idea. Follow me. [soft chuckle] [groaning] [Lupin] Berger. [grunts, groans] [Lupin grunts] You're not getting away. Hurry! Pick up the pace! Block the doors! Make sure… - [Ai] Forty-three paces. Three paces. - Ai… - Twenty-two paces. - We can't hold on much longer. [Hitomi] The smoke's gonna clear soon. I'm ready. This card will do the rest. To think our last resort would be our Cat's cards. Well, that is on brand for us. [Rui] Ready? Go! Fire! - [Dennis] Take them out already! - [soldier yells] [soldier] Just there! Now! - Ai! - OK! - [soldier 1] What? - [soldier 2] Where are they? [soldier 3] Get the lights! Keep it down! - The girls can't see either. - [Ai] Try again. [soldier] Lost 'em. [Dennis grunts] Where are they? - [breathes deeply] - [soldier 1] Anything? - [soldier 2] Over here. - [soldier 3] This way. - [Dennis grunts] - [Ai grunts] [yells] Don't move! It's pointless to resist. - Don't get any closer! - [soldier] Stop her! Or this man dies right now. Give us back our dad's art. I don't care about his art. Go after Berger if you want it. [Ai] Berger? I'll kill anyone in my way! You'll meet your demise here! [gasps] [soldiers yelling] - [soldier 1] Get out! - [soldier 2] Run! Lupin! Run! They got the best of both of us. [Rui] Hitomi, time to run. You should run too. [yells] Don't worry. I've got you. [grunts] [Ai whimpers] - The other exits? - I don't know! [crashing] [Fujiko] Kittens! This way! Come to me! Hurry! Let's go. Go! [panting] [laughs] Foolish girls. - [Jigen] Hey, mister. - Oh! Huh? You? You got some nerve tricking us. But… how are you alive? [grunts] Oh! You may pay with your death. You monsters! [rumbling] [yells] [groans] - [Lupin] So pathetic. - [groans] I can't believe I let the last pact be with a bad guy like you. Oh. Lupin. I'm so sorry, Heinz. Your ideals were… a little too heavy for me. [groans] No, don't! [yells] My… My contract! Do you have the slightest clue how much abuse I endured under that cruel boss? I withstood that humiliation and maintained my position in the syndicate. And you… And you, a mere petty thief… [gunshot] You forgot about the curse of the Stones of Fortuna. Once you lose the stones, you will perish. Lupin, thank you. You assisted me in the burying of a traitor. So, is it our turn to settle things now? [soft chuckle] If you don't wanna perish too, then leave this place. I'll allow you to go this time for the help you provided. Allow me to go, huh? How incredibly selfish of you, Dennis. What's that? Don't go getting carried away, now, Lupin. All right. Let's get on with this. You guys. There. Now, that's more like it. I'm tired of getting the short end. I would say this is a worthy place to die. Are you insane? Want to test us, Dennis? This is where… we happen to be the strongest. [sighs] What is it you want? Money? Treasure? [rumbling] [Lupin] A promise. Promise? You're joking. You just want the paintings? [Lupin] No. Never go near Cat's Eye again. If you do… I'll gladly put you in the ground without hesitation. Do what you want. [crashing] [Fujiko] You should be safe here. - See you later. - [Rui] Huh? - [Fujiko] The treasure's getting away. - Wait. What about Lupin? Don't even bother worrying. - I'm sure he's alive. - Hmm. - Also… - Hmm? You owe me for this one. I'll be collecting soon enough. OK. We promise. - [car door closes] - [Nagaishi] Your ride has arrived. - Huh? - Hello there, ladies. - Mr Nagaishi. - Now, let's go home. [newsreader] This is a follow-up regarding the collapse of the ancient Roman ruins in Paris. An absolutely staggering number of guns stolen, as well as counterfeit art, along with artworks plundered by Nazi Germany were recently discovered at the Paris office of Faden, an art dealership, where the explosion occurred. The long-established art dealership's scandal was uncovered by two Japanese investigators. We bring you their interview here. Lupin the 3rd and Cat's Eye… [laughs] Toshi? He's still in France? We are extremely honoured to have been a part of this massive great uncovering. I… I am… glad that we found the artwork this time! Toshio is really stiff. Yeah, it's hard to watch. Girls, we never found our father's three paintings in the end. It's unfortunate. [sighs] What's the matter? Is it Lupin? Well, I… I'm sure he's alive, Ai. You promised, didn't you? Not like I had a choice. [reporter] This just in. TV stations have received a message from who we believe to be Lupin the 3rd. - What? - Hey! I knew that man was still alive! [reporter] The message is as follows. "As promised, the father's love was returned to his family." "The final flower bouquet turns into love." Lupin the 3rd. What does this mean exactly? - [gasps] - [Zenigata] Lupin! Oh, wait. Ai? [door closes] You don't think…? [panting] [sighs] [Ai] Father's series were paintings of the family. I found out in my research afterwards that the title of this series of three is Celebration. [Hitomi] So that's why we were holding bouquets. [Ai] Is this celebrating Mom? Could it be…? - Lupin's message. - [gasps] [Rui] "The final flower bouquet turns into love." Which means… [Hitomi] Of course. - [gasps] - [Ai laughs] [sniffs] [Ai] I was here all along. [Ai] Thank you, Lupin. [engine starts]
