Mrs. Finley! I picked up the cake. Oh, good. I want to take a look. Oh! Wonderful. It's his favourite. Time goes so fast! It's hard to believe he's been away a year. Ah, 11 months, actually. Ah, I've missed him. Never been apart this long. Oh, it'll be wonderful to have him home. I have depended on him so much since his father died. Mrs. Finley... you'll never be alone as long as I'm alive. I'm here for you. Thanks, Louise. Well, I'm heading to the grocery store to pick up the lamb and shrimp. What time do you expect him? Well, his flight lands at 3:30. With traffic and a stop by his apartment, I expect he'll be here by seven. Is your brother joining? No. Victor said he has plans, but he might pop by later for dessert. Okay! Well, I'll see you in a little while. Great! Take a look at the report I just sent you. We need to update our logistics software, it's obsolete. There have been significant delays in several ports. We can deal with all that when you come into the office tomorrow. What, you're not coming for dinner tonight? No, I had a commitment that I wasn't able to reschedule. Besides, your mother will want you all to herself. Yeah, she's been emailing me about it daily. I have a little surprise for her. Jack, you know your mother's not fond of surprises. Yeah, well, this one's different. Okay! Welcome back. Thanks Uncle Victor. It hasn't even been an hour, and you're on your phone. It's an addiction. He may be my uncle, but he still calls the shots. Kissing the ring upon return to the kingdom is a must. I thought you were the favoured son? Just because I'm family, doesn't mean I'm favoured. They should know you're a star. Yeah. It's different. This restructuring in Singapore was my first test. In many ways, it's harder now. Well, I'm grateful for that little test. Why? 'Cause if you hadn't spent all that time in Singapore, we never would have met. - It was meant to be. - Mm-hmm. I am concerned about this little plan of yours. What? My surprise? I still can't believe I went along with it, to spring me on your mother unannounced. I told you, my mother likes to ruminate on everything and she can be... difficult. Getting the first introduction out of the way quickly was the best way. I don't know if I buy your strategy, but she's your mother. I'm telling you, it's better to have her meet you in person. See how fabulous you are. Okay, I trust you. You should. Okay, I'll be back here to pick you up by seven. Okay. I'll be ready. Look at me. This is gonna be great. We're gonna find out soon enough. - Love you. - I love you. - See you soon. - Okay. Hello? Is someone there? We have nearly 1,200 empty containers sitting in Taipei. My sources tell me the strike won't settle anytime soon. What are our options? I'm in touch with the truckers' union. They might be able to move them, but it'll cost a minimum of 20% more. Well, we have no choice, do we? - Very well, I'll follow up. - Oh, Stan. Jack is coming in tomorrow. Can you help him get settled? I want him to feel welcome. - Of course. - Good. Do you know anything about the woman he's seeing over there? Um, don't know much. She works for our accounting firm. She was reassigned to Singapore while Jack was there. Do you know how long they've been together? I gather they've been together for a six months. Where is she now? - I'm not sure. - Can you find out? Yes. Of course. Hey, Mom. Running a few minutes late. See you soon. So, what else is new? - I spoke to Dad last night. - Really? Said he's moving. Again. Found something closer to the beach. Good for him. I hope he finds what he's looking for. While we're on the subject of exes, I spoke to Amanda and she said that Jack was coming back. He's finished his business abroad. Oh. When? Um, I think he's here now. Were you not going to tell me? I didn't want you to get hurt. You're doing so well with your third yoga studio, why open up old wounds? Mom... I was upset when Jack ended things, but I didn't want to move overseas anyway. I was building my business. It turned out to be for the best. If you say so. Is he... seeing anyone? She didn't say. So you're curious? A little. - You want me to ask her? - No! I don't want you to ask her. Okay. Well, I promise if I find out anything else, I won't hold out on you. What else haven't you shared? I made the list of the Top 100 Real Estate Agents. Mom! That's great! Congratulations! Thanks! Look at us, both successful businesswomen! You okay? I'm apprehensive about meeting your mother and sharing our wedding plans all at the same time. It's a bit much, don't you think? Olivia, I'm not sure how long I'm gonna be here before they send me overseas again. Six months? A year, maybe? I don't want to wait. My friend Lisa eloped and she said it was the best decision they ever made. - I can't do that to my family. - I know. I think you want your parents there too, don't you? I suppose. It is a lot for your mom to process, though. You have to admit that. It is. But in the end, I think she'll understand. Here we are! Your family home is stunning! Yeah, it's alright. Okay, this... is gonna be great. Okay? Okay! Alright. Wait here. Mom. Jackson! - Hi, Louise. - So nice to see you! Oh, great to see you! Jack! Oh, you look great! I missed you. I missed you too, Mom. Oh, I can't believe you're finally home. Uh, Mom. Uh... There's someone I want you to meet. Olivia. Mom, this is Olivia Clark. Olivia, this is my mother, Amanda Finley. Mrs. Finley, it is so nice to meet you. Jack has told me so much about you. Has he? Oh, these are for you. Um, they're lovely. Thank you. Um... Sorry, I'm just a little surprised. Louise, could you set another place for Jackson's, uh... guest? Of course. - Here. - Wonderful. Jack, why don't you fix us all a drink? I could use one. Sounds good. The usual for you? - Mm-hmm. - And... No, thank you. Um, yes, please, come in. Olivia, did you say it was? Yes. Lovely. Um, why don't you have a seat? Thank you. I apologize, Olivia. I'm just a little thrown. Jack didn't tell me he was inviting someone this evening. Well... Olivia's not just anyone, Mom. She's my fiancée. We fell in love in Singapore. You're getting married? Yeah. I waited to tell you, 'cause I wanted to surprise you tonight. Uh... You mentioned that you were in a relationship, but you didn't say it was a serious one. Jack and I are very much in love and we hope for your blessing. Well, congratulations. Mom, I'm only home for a short time and it's important for me to bring the family together for a celebration. Isn't that what you want? Yes, of course. Who else knows? No one. You're the first. Thoughtful. And you let him talk you into revealing your engagement to me in this manner? Well, this was my idea. No, I thought that, I just wondered what Olivia thought. Honestly, I questioned Jack from the beginning, but he assured me this was the best approach, so I went along with it, hoping that you would accept me into your life. I see. Forgive me, but I'm a little bit set in my ways and new relationships, especially important ones like this, they take time. Of course. And your parents. Do they know? Uh, no. We're not close. - Siblings? - No, I'm an only child. Oh. Well, you have that in common with Jack, don't you? Although I'm a little surprised only children would be so... independent. Well, I mean, I would think it would be opposite. An only child making such an important life decision might think to include the parents. - Mom... - Excuse me, Mrs. Finley. Dinner is served. Wonderful. Let's enjoy your favourite dinner then, Jack. Oh! Let me guess. Chilled shrimp, lamb chops and mashed potatoes? Well, it seems like you two have gotten to know each other. Shall we? So, how did you two meet? - On a Zoom call. - Mm-hmm. How modern. Yeah, Olivia is a rising star at International Accounting Services, our CPA firm. Oh. And what did you do before that? I went to college here in Washington, majored in accounting. I got a few jobs working at CPAs and then worked my way into commercial shipping. You said that your parents were out of state. How did you end up on the West Coast? Oh, I grew up in here in Bellevue. I lived with my dad until he remarried and moved to Arizona. And your mother? My parents divorced when I was 12. She moved away shortly after that. So tell me a little bit more about your job. Mom. Do we really have to do the whole cross-examination thing? Well, I'm just trying to get to know your fiancé. It's fine. Uh, like I was saying, I was eager to get out of an office environment, so after I finished a forensic accounting program, I landed a job at International Accounting Services. It was my dream job. An international company with offices all over the world? It gave me the opportunity to travel, which is my passion. And what are your plans now? Oh. I guess... to be together? What I mean is, do you plan to continue to work? Yeah, of course. Oh. Excuse me, Mrs. Finley. Your brother called to say that unfortunately he won't be able to make it this evening. Well, that's a little odd. Excuse me while I go check up on Victor. I really don't think this is going well. She seems very upset. No, she's just... she's a little caught off guard. It's going to be fine. I promise. What, they're engage? You knew nothing about this? No. I knew that he was seeing somebody in Singapore, but that's no big surprise. I didn't think anything of it. Victor, you didn't think to tell me that he's in a serious relationship? Amanda, calm down. Well, what else do you know about her? That she worked for our CPA firm and that they've been together for about six months. Six months? And they're engaged? Victor, that is ridiculous. I know you're upset, but give it a chance. Well, she doesn't feel right for him. I mean, she's not Rachel, not even close. - Amanda! - No. A mother has instincts, and I'm telling you, there's something just off about her. Amanda, will you listen to yourself? You cannot compare everyone to Rachel. Well, I need to put an end to this, so I'll call you tomorrow. Olivia! Can I get you another glass of wine? Mm, mom. This is so good, it's just like I remember. Well, I'm glad you still like it. You can take the rest home. Are you kidding? That's way too much. What am I going to do with it? Please, take it. Olivia... I would love to continue this conversation, but you must be exhausted from your journey. Would you like to have coffee tomorrow? I can do that. Does afternoon work for you? Of course. After six months in Singapore, you must have a lot to do. Six months? How did you know six months? Oh, um... Jack's uncle Victor told me on the phone. Seems you two tried to keep your affair a secret, but apparently it was well known in the office. Mm... Okay... It's time to go. Oh, Jack, I'm only sharing what I was told. That's all. Thank you for a wonderful dinner, Mom. It was delicious. Good night. I'm gonna grab your coat, okay? It was really nice to meet you, Mrs. Finley. I look forward to our coffee. As do I. Um, I'll get your number from Jack and we'll meet somewhere close by you. - Great. - Shall we? Yeah. Good night, Mother. You want to talk about it? Your mother does not like me. That's not true. She can be very... blunt, but she warms up. - I'm not sure about that. - Trust me. She'll come around. She invited you for coffee, hmm? That's a good sign. I knew this was a bad idea. We shouldn't have surprised her like this. Maybe, but I still think it was the best way to make her support us. Make her? I didn't think we would need to make her. I thought she just... would. Hey, look at me. Look at me. We are going to get married. Okay? Nothing is going to come between us. Nothing. Okay? Okay? Okay. - I love you. - I love you. Nothing. It'll be okay. Jack! Stan Wu. I work on the Singapore account. Yeah, Stan. Good to see you. I think we've met. Yes. It's been awhile. Welcome back. Thank you. Hey, I'd like to take a look at the manifests for the Asia-Pacific routes as soon as I get settled in. Can we catch up after lunch? - Absolutely. - Awesome. Knock, knock! Hey! Welcome back! Great to see you, Victor. You must be jet lagged. I'm surprised you came in so early. Well, that's the beauty of flying first class, you can sleep on the plane. I was excited to get started. Of course you are. Let me show you your new office. I think you're gonna really like it. Uh... Did my mother call you? You mean about the surprise? - Yeah. - Yeah. Take a seat for a minute. Come on, sit down. Yeah, your mother called me last night. I don't know why you thought surprising her with your girlfriend - Fiancée. - Fiancée... how surprising her like that would win you any points? It was a little reckless, Jack. You know I could be sent back to Asia at any time. I want to get married here. Well, think about it from her perspective. I mean, she wants to get to know Olivia and understand her intentions. Her intentions? You think she's after the family fortune? It's not personal, Jack. It's a big deal, bringing someone into this family. Listen to yourself. You sound like Don Corleone. Jack... I understand your frustrations, but frankly, I'm with your mother on this. With her on what, exactly? On slowing things down. Besides, you know it's against company policy to get involved with a co-worker. She's not a co-worker. Working for our CPA firm is the same thing. She has access to financial data. You could be compromised. Look. The fact is, we're going to get married. The family can either choose to accept that or not, but it's not gonna change the outcome. Well, I'm sure once your mother gets comfortable with Olivia, she'll support you. And if she doesn't? I'm confident she will. I don't know. Ever since Dad died, it's like she treats me like a teenager. I miss him too, but I have to move on with my life. You can understand that, can't you? - Of course I can, Jack. - Say you support me. I will. I just want you to slow it down a little... that you can always come back for a month next year and get married. Just slow it down. - Great to see you, Victor. - Great to see you. I'll walk you to your office. It's okay. I'll find it. Hmm, hmm, hmm... Sir? Everything okay? I'm not sure. Any more information on that girl? I spoke to a few people from our Singapore office. They thought Olivia had her sights on Jack as soon as she met him. Hm, that sounds like gossip. I'm just telling you what her co-workers are saying. Apparently, she was on weekly Zoom calls with Jack and spoke to him in a manner some would consider inappropriate. Like what? I guess she was, like, flirting with him in front of her superiors. And then the next thing you know, she's on a flight to Singapore. That'll get the gossip mill going. Rumour was that Jack made a deal for her to get sent there. A deal? What kind of deal? A quid pro quo. That he pushed through a lucrative contract for a CAP client without proper vetting. Seems uncharacteristic for Jack. Maybe she did a favour for someone to get closer to him. Maybe she's the instigator. Maybe. I have a another take on it. I'm listening. What if she's working for our competition? She has access to sensitive information that could hurt us if it got in the wrong hands. You mean like corporate spying? Exactly. Look into it. Will do. Hi, Jack. Hi. I just wanted to see how coffee went. I'm on my way. I had to choose a different coffee shop. I didn't care very much for the one she picked. Alright, just try to be nice, okay? Of course. You know, I'm not that bad. You've been known to be a bit intimidating at times. I promise to be my most charming self. Okay. Thank you. - I love you. - Love you too. Bye. Olivia. Hi, Mrs. Finley. I am so sorry I'm late, I took the long way by accident. No problem. Would you like something? Uh... No, I'm fine with water. Really? I just saw the serv... I'm fine with water. Thank you. Okay. Thank you for making the journey out here. And for picking this place. It's so close, but I've never been here before. Well, it's really the only place I'll come to this side of town. But... no, I don't mind. I really wanted to see where you lived. Not much to see. Just a typical Seattle suburb. But I like it. And is this where you plan on living with Jack? Probably not. We haven't decided, but when he's overseas, I'll be with him, so we're just not ready to commit yet. Oh. Children? Uh, yes. I'm very excited to be a mother, when the time is right. I love kids. A working mother? Yeah. Yeah, I think a woman can have a career and raise children, with the father as an equal partner, of course. And what if his job doesn't allow that? I think most companies nowadays understand that they have to prioritize so their employees can work and have a family. Hmm. Oh! almost forgot. I got you something from Singapore. Oh! It's called kaya. It's coconut jam. It's very popular and really delicious. I turned Jack onto it and he just loves it. That's really thoughtful. You know, I will have something to drink. Thank you. Great. Can you get the server? Oh. Yes. I will go get her. I'll be right back. I don't trust her. She's an opportunist. I understand your concern. There's something not right about her, and I am determined to find out what it is. Don't you think you're getting ahead of yourself? You barely met her. I trust my instincts. Your son loves her, Amanda. Just give her a chance. Caroline, your daughter is a perfect match for my son. Our family have known each other for generations. But it was not meant to be. I never really understood what happened with them. Rachel didn't really give me details, but I know that Jack broke it off. Maybe... we could try to make it happen again. Make what happen? Rachel and Jack together. We could arrange a spontaneous encounter, make the sparks fly again! I know in my heart Rachel is the right one for him. Rachel has a successful business and she's happy. You have to accept that she's moved on. But she's not seeing anyone, right? No... So come on, what do we have to lose? Rachel is not easily manipulated. I'm sorry, I can't be part of this. Just think about it. - Okay. - Okay? Don't take it personally. How can I not take it personally? You have to accept that your mother and I are not going to get along. I'll talk to her. Okay? Did she like your last girlfriend? She was fine with her. Oh, good, so it is me. Is she from "the right family"? Can we not do this? Please? Look... I love you. That's all that matters. If my mother can't accept that, then so be it. She's your mother. I want her to like me. Is something wrong? No, j-just something I have to deal with. I need a little bit of time alone. Let's not do this. Just to process things. I'll call you later, okay? Whatever you need. Thank you. He suggested that she might be spying. You mean for another company? Yes. Most likely one of our Chinese competitors. - Is there proof? - No. Not yet. Well, we can't say anything to Jack until we have something solid. Stan is working on it. There he is. Uncle Vic, I didn't know you'd be here. I invited him here so that we could all have a civilized conversation. Could you please sit down and have a glass of wine? No, thank you. And if civilized is what you want, your coffee with Olivia today hardly qualified. Sweetheart, I was only trying to get to know her. She can tell you disapprove. You're not very good at hiding your feelings, Mother. Look, both of you need to get on board with the fact that Olivia and I are getting married. If you cannot accept that, we will no longer have a relationship. Is that what you want? - No... - Well, it's where we're headed. Look, Jack, Victor and I think that Olivia isn't being honest with you. About what? About her intentions. In what way? There are questions about her transfer to Singapore. She may have been targeting you. We met through work. She was sent by her supervisor and is an asset to her team. What is the issue? There are rumours that her transfer may have been a quid pro quo. What the hell are you talking about? That you coerced CAP to have her sent to Singapore as a favour to a client of theirs. No, that is insane! I would never do that. Well, then explain it, Jack. There's nothing to explain. I trust her. That's all there is to it. Jack! Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you. Who are you? I, uh... I live in 206. Oh. I'm... I'm so sorry. You just surprised me. No problem. Good night. Pick up, pick up, pick up. This is Jack Finley, leave a message. Hi, Jack, it's me. Call me back. I'm not going to call her employer until we have some solid proof. I'm working on it, but it could be too late. She might have already shared sensitive information. This is a huge scandal if we make an accusation and we're wrong. A hunch isn't enough. I put a tap on her phone. How did you manage that? I have my ways. I don't want to know, but keep me posted. Hi. What happened last night? I tried to call you. Yeah, sorry, I left my phone off the charger and it died. It didn't go well with my mother. Big surprise. Look, I need to talk to you about something. Sure. What is it? No, in person. How about I come to your office? - Now? - Yeah. I'm gonna get changed and I'll head over, okay? - Okay. - Okay, bye. You shot these yourself? Yeah. I mean, I was there for like eight hours. I knew she was up to something! Yeah. They were engaged in what we like to call an "intimate conversation" for the better part of an hour. What happened then? Then they parted ways. You didn't follow the man? He got away from me. - I was told you were the best. - These things happen. Do we have any idea who he is? No. But I will find out. Well, it's important that we identify him. How long would that take? It's hard to say. I'll have to do some more surveillance until they meet again. I'm gonna need another payment. Yeah, I'll take care of it. Can you email these to me? Mm-hmm. Now? Hi. I'm Olivia Clark. I'm here to see Jack. Excuse me. Hi, Olivia. I'm Stan Wu. I work with Jack. - Hi. - I'll show you to his office. Great, thanks. I know your supervisor, Bill Gottlieb. He's my point person at your firm. Oh, yeah. Bill's great. He's a real mentor. You must be busy working long hours, juggling between clients. No, actually, I'm assigned exclusively to INTEX. There's a lot here to keep me busy, though. I'm working from home, so it saves not having to commute. There it is. I'm sure he'll be happy to see you. Look who I found! - Hi! Come on in. - Hi. Thank you, Stan. Nice to meet you. - You want to sit down? - Yeah. So, what's up? You're going to think I'm crazy, but I'm pretty sure someone was in my condo last night. What? How would they get in? Maybe they got the key from my super? I've never trusted that guy. Okay, I'll tell you what, we're gonna get the locks changed, okay? Would that make you feel better? Yeah. But there's something else I need to tell you. What? I've been tracking payments made from INTEX to a subcontractor, a trucking firm in Manila. - And? - I think it's fake. They seem to have gone out of business two years ago but the offices are still operating. Well, how do you know? I've been watching their building from a webcam across the street. There's activity. How much money is involved? Almost a million dollars. I think someone is stealing from INTEX. - We have to tell Victor. - No. Not yet. The payment instructions are coming from here, in Seattle. And if I'm right, from in this office. That is a serious accusation. I know. And I think whoever is behind it is on to me. - This is shocking. - Yeah. That woman is up to something. And she has my son wrapped around her finger. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna find out who this man is and expose her. Be careful. - Why? What do you mean? - Well, I don't know, there could be something you haven't thought of. Well, if it's an affair, that would undoubtedly break them up and... leave an opening for Rachel. Amanda, stop. Don't give up so easily. We both want the same thing. If you want to end Jack's relationship with Olivia, that's your prerogative. But please leave Rachel and I out of it. Hmm. Caroline, I think you're being close minded. Maybe so. I'm actually surprised that you're not being more supportive of me. You're my best friend. Our children have been close their whole lives. I'm just concerned about my daughter. It took her so long to get over Jack, I don't want to open up old wounds. Well, I'll tell you something, if this marriage goes through, there might be new wounds to deal with that may never heal. Ugh, I didn't realize how late it was. I have an appointment at the house. I'll call you later. - See you guys next week. - Bye. Thank you. Hi. Mom. I got your text. You wanted to talk? Yes. I saw Amanda and she told me something I wanted to share. Okay. Apparently, she hired a private investigator to spy on Jack's girlfriend. Really? She says she has photos of Olivia seeing someone. She was having an affair... That's what she thinks. Does Jack know his mother did that? I doubt it. It doesn't surprise me. - What? - You know how protective Amanda is of Jack, and now she's gone and hired a PI, it's kind of crazy. I know. She's a bit obsessed. Jack needs to know. And if Amanda won't tell him, I will. Hi. What is going on? I sent so many text messages. Are you serious? What do you need now? No! Absolutely not! No, no! Leave me alone! Do not call again. Enough. Damn it. It says the transaction has been completed but the money is not in the allocated account. Yes, it's urgent. 12,000. I'm on the West Coast. No, the funds have been withdrawn, I'm looking at the account balance right now. Yeah... Uh, who is it? I... Yes, okay, just hold on one second please. That's weird, I didn't... No... Olivia. Olivia?! Olivia, did you know your door is open... Olivia? Olivia, what... Oh, my God. Olivia, talk to me, what happened? Olivia! Olivia, stay with me! Olivia! Olivia! The doctor will be in shortly to give you an update but the good news is that she's stable. It's most important. Thank you. Hi. I'm Detective Armstrong. I just have a few questions. So you entered the building and went to her apartment. Did anyone see you? No, I was walking down the hallway and I noticed that her door was open. And no one else was present? No, I didn't see anyone else. What was your business with Ms. Clark? Well, I went to speak with her, she's dating my... - - son. - Amanda! There you are. Victor. I'm so happy to see you. Oh... I think we're done for now, someone from the department will contact you to follow up. I'm just relieved you're okay. It was terrible, I mean, I thought she was dead. Oh my gosh. Is Jack here? I'll be right back. Jack. How's she doing? Uh, it's hard to say. She hasn't woken up yet. Olivia's so lucky that your mother went there when she did. She probably saved her life. She asked me for Olivia's address and then she just... shows up? What the hell was she doing there? Jack, she just went there to talk. Did she? I'm not so sure. Jack, this is your mother we're talking about. I just got here. And a neighbour said a woman just got picked up by paramedics. And they think it was Olivia. Yeah, I'm at the hospital. She was attacked. Is she okay? Yeah. We think so. Uh, do you have anything more on the man in the photographs? No, but it's reasonable to suspect that he was connected with this. I'm gonna go over there and watch the hospital. Okay. You do that. I have to go. Come on. I'll take you home. I'm gonna talk to the detective in charge tomorrow, find out what's going on. Well, hopefully she'll wake up soon enough and remember what happened and be able to tell them. Yeah. There's something I haven't shared with you. What's this? I hired a private investigator to follow Olivia. You what? He took these photographs two nights ago. She's been secretly seeing a man. Oh my God. Who is it? Well, I don't know, but hopefully we'll have more information soon enough. This is not good. We need to talk to Jack. Well, in time. I was on my way over to confront Olivia tonight. Why not talk to Jack first? Because I want Olivia to admit that she's lying to him. And I'm tired of being the bad guy, Victor. Can't help but wonder if he's her contact to our competitor. You mean, part of their corporate spy thing? Yeah. I haven't mentioned anything to Jack because everything's so circumstantial, but I should know more soon. Promise me you won't say anything to Jack until we have more information. I won't, but I will tell the private investigator. He might be able to help identify the man in the photos. Yeah. Why don't you go get some sleep? She's in good hands. Oh, no, that's okay. I think I'll stay. The doctor prescribed her a sedative that'll keep her stable through the night. She'll need you fully rested when it wears off in the morning. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. I'm here till seven. I'll watch her closely. Yeah. Yeah, maybe you're right. Thank you. Come on. Ah-ha. Got ya. Got him. Just gonna check on Ms. Clark. Paging Nurse Danielle to the nurse's station. Paging Nurse Danielle to the nurse's station. Emergency in 11A, code blue, code blue! Her IV's been tampered with, it's compromised. Get a clean saline, STAT, and an AED ready, she may be in shock. Olivia. Oh, my God, are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I just have a headache. I was so worried about you. Why are there security guards outside of her room? I can tell you that there was an attempt to inject Olivia's IV with a foreign substance. - Oh, my God. - Wait, what sort of substance? We're not sure. The lab is analyzing it now, but the important thing is that we caught it in time, flushed your system and extracted all traces of it. This is a nightmare. I can't believe what I'm hearing. How can we be sure someone on the staff didn't make a mistake? It happens all the time. Whatever was used is not a medication available to us, it came from outside the hospital. Who would do this? I understand the security camera caught someone suspicious on the floor last night. I'm gonna get you full-time security. This is not going to happen again. You should know the police have been contacted and they are sending someone. I'll leave you two alone. Thank you. What? What's on your mind? Your mother was behind this. She hates me. Olivia, you're upset, and you're reaching for answers. But you're safe now. I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you. - What do you have? - I caught him last night on the camera at the hospital. Finally. I ran him through facial recognition software and it came up on a mug shot. Richard Frankel. - And who is he? - I'm not sure. He was arrested for drug possession, may have been using a fake ID or alias. I'll check with the local PD and confirm his identity. Um, you should know that there was an incident at the hospital last night. What kind of an incident? Um, I'm not sure, um... I'm sure the police will tell you when they come talk to you. Are you serious? That's what they told me. I'll check in soon. Victor. I need your help. Take your time. Scroll through the images. Do you recognize the individual? No, the hooded sweatshirt's covering their face. Is that... Is that a bandana around the neck? Does he have to be here? Olivia. I am part of this family. We are all concerned with how you're doing. Ms. Clark. Please continue. If I had to guess, I'd say it was a woman. Maybe Amanda Finley. The way that she moves and that scarf on her neck. I can't be sure but... You're gonna question her, right? Find out where she was last night? That is ridiculous! Jack, you don't believe your mother had anything to do with this, do you? I just want Olivia to feel safe. Thank you, Ms. Clark, we'll be in touch, okay? Thank you. Detective. Can I get a copy of that footage? Um, I'll make sure hospital security makes it available to you. Good. I appreciate that. Now, Ms. Clark has been under a lot of stress. And considering the assault and the head injury, I'm just worried that she's focused on the wrong person. Now, Mrs. Finley is just not capable of this. Skulking around a hospital in the middle of the night trying to poison a patient? Come on. It's laughable. I appreciate your concern. We intend to interview Mrs. Finley at the station this afternoon. Please let her know. Jack, I'm so scared. I don't understand what the hell is going on. I know, honey. We're gonna get to the bottom of this, I promise. Someone is trying to kill me and I can't make sense of it. Do you think it's someone at INTEX? Something to do with the missing funds? I don't know. How well do you know your uncle? Olivia, Victor is not trying to kill you. I want you to move into my place until we get this sorted out, okay? - Jack, I... - Olivia, please. I'm serious. Fine. But I need you to do something for me first. Anything. I'm going to email you the phone number of the trucking company in Manila. They're probably operating under a different name. Call them. Tell them who you are and that you need to confirm payments through their bank. Then find out who the intermediary bank is for the wire deposits. - Okay. I got it. - That's very important. The intermediary bank is where the funds are being redirected. Find someone high up in the bank and make them give you that information. Okay. I'm on it. I'll be back soon. This is Jack Finley, I'm the executive VP at INTEX. We've noticed some troubling anomalies with some of our accounts, I'd like to speak to somebody about it right away. Yeah, I'll hold. No, Stan, I can't right now. I'll come back. Yes. Hello, I'm looking for information on payments made to Manila Express. Yeah, it's one of our subcontractors. Can you tell me who the intermediary bank is? Yeah, for all the wires. Okay. Okay, call me when you have the information. Thank you. I chose not to have an attorney present in the spirit of co-operation. That's your choice. Please tell me where you were last night. Um... Yes, I, uh... was at home. Louise, my housekeeper was off, so I made myself some dinner. Um, I watched the news and then I went to bed early. Did you speak with or see anyone during that time? Yes, I spoke with my brother Victor on the phone about Olivia. What time was that? Um... around 9 PM. Do you know who this is? No. I do not. Do you recognize the scarf in that image? Uh... It looks like one that I own. When's the last time you wore it? I... I have no idea! Is it in your possession? Well, I would think so, I'd have to check at home. Can I have your phone to review your calls? Um, yes. I'll let you know when you can leave. How about I go make you some tea? How's that sound? Yes please. Thank you. Well, look at the bright side, at least you're sleeping in your own bed tonight. Yeah, and what about tomorrow? Ah, one day at a time. Until they identify the intruder in the security camera, you're gonna continue to be a person of interest. Well, that scarf looked exactly like one that I own. Is that a coincidence? It's gotta be. I'm gonna check I haven't lost it. Well, why didn't you mention the photos of Olivia? I mean, it would help your case to have another person of interest. No, not yet. But I do think that it's time that we tell Jack. Uh, about the photos, maybe. But I want to hold off on everything else. Someone tried to kill her last night, and if that's related to corporate spying, the FBI's gonna get involved and that's gonna be a huge mess for us as a company. No, I don't want things to escalate... until we know more. Okay, whatever you think is best, but I printed the photos that I was gonna show Olivia. Her and that man. I want you to deliver them to Jack. - Today? - Yes! I want him to confront Olivia. Just take me home and have someone deliver them to his house. Uh, I'd love to be a fly on the wall for the conversation. Well, hopefully it'll be their last. Right, yeah. I need it 24 hours a day, watching her condo. No, she's not going anywhere right now. Okay, I'll wait to hear from you. Is all of this security necessary? Yes. We need it until you know what's going on. Okay? When are you supposed to hear back from Manila? They said later tonight, but you know how things go. - What is it? - It's just, it's a text... From the bank? No. It's from Rachel. Rachel? Like, your ex, Rachel? You didn't tell me you guys were in contact. Why is she texting you? Jack, what? Talk to me. He's... Jack! She says my mother hired a private investigator to follow us. What? Wait, how would she even know that? Her mother and my mother are close friends. Your mother is crazy, she's trying to get between us with your ex. You see that, right? I will get her to stop, okay? You said that days ago and it's only gotten worse. You haven't done anything to stop her. Please... Just... just one second. What is that? What is it? Jack, what's wrong? Looks like it's your turn to explain. I just, I don't understand all this secrecy. Why didn't you tell me you have a brother? Because he was an addict and he has a police record and I didn't want to jeopardize what we have. You know you could tell me anything. I know, but it's complicated with him. What? Does he want money? Yes. But that's not what this is about. He wants a second chance. He wants me to help him find a job, he wants me in his life. What'd you say? I felt sorry for him, but I told him I can't commit to anything. And he got angry. You have to understand, I'm the only person that he has. What about your parents? After his third arrest, they disowned him. They said he was dead to them. They went around telling people that he died of an overdose, they just erased him. That's terrible. They live their life their way and no one's gonna change that. Where's your brother now? I don't know. He texted yesterday. Can I meet him? Are you serious? Of course. If he's an important part of your life, he's a part of mine too. Text him. I want to meet him in person. Thank you. I appreciate you stopping by. It's been a rough couple of days. I can only imagine. I didn't know if Louise was here and I didn't want you to be alone. Thank you. So, did you confront Olivia with the photos? It's in the works. - Today? - Mm-hmm. - Does Jack know? - I think so. Victor was having the photographs delivered to him this afternoon. Wow. Can't wait to hear how that went. Well, I hope it ends the relationship. And with any luck, Rachel and Jack can be together again. With wedding plans cancelled, maybe there's a chance, Amanda. You must admit, it would be lovely if that happened. It would. Oh, that might be Jack. Let's see what he has to say about our little escapade. Hi. Yes... You have a name? Ah... are you sure? Okay. Um, thank you. I will. What was that? That was strange... That was the private investigator saying that he found the real identity of the man in the photographs. And? And it's Olivia's younger brother, Russel. Oh. What do you make of that? I don't know. I can't thank you enough for letting me in your home. Thank Jack, it was his suggestion. I really do appreciate it. I apologize for following you around, I, um... was a little desperate there. So what's the deal, Russ? What do you want from Olivia? She's my sister, I just want to be a part of her life. I don't have any other family, so... What's your plan? Um, listen, I understand your apprehension about letting me into your lives but I want to ensure you my intentions are honest. I want to get a job, I want to prove that I'm worthy, I just, um... need a little help doing that. - And the drugs? - None. Been clean and sober for a year. All behind me. Please, I'm asking you to trust me one more time. What kind of job are you looking to get? Well, my degree is in computer science, I used to hold a high-level IT job at a communications firm until my addiction got me fired. I'll tell you what, why don't I see what we have at INTEX? Okay. I would really, really appreciate that. Thank you. No promises. It's Manila. Okay. Yes, hello, I requested the intermediary bank... - Thank you so much. - for Manila Express. I really appreciate that. - Of course. - Subcontractor, yes. We're family. I won't let you down. I missed you. I missed you too. You have them? In front of you? Yes, excellent. Uh, yeah, you have my email? You must be relieved to know she wasn't having an affair. Yes, but I'm a little conflicted, to be honest with you. I mean, on one hand, she's not betraying Jack, but on the other hand, my hopes of them breaking up are dashed. Well, maybe in time, you'll grow to accept her. Maybe, but... question remains, somebody tried to poison Olivia. It could be that the brother was involved. I trust the police will get to the bottom of it once they interview him. I... I hope so, but in the meantime, I better call Jack and make amends, he's probably livid about the private investigator. No doubt. But Jack loves you, I'm sure he'll see you're only looking out for him. Well, I really hope you're right. I'm just gonna use the bathroom. This is Jack Finley, leave a message. Jack, sweetheart, it's me. I feel terrible about what has happened. I've gotten off on the completely wrong foot with Olivia. Please call me, I really want to talk to you. What are you doing? Oh, you loaned me this scarf a few months ago, and I forgot to return it, so I figured I'd just put it back for you. I never loaned you this scarf. You took it. I saw it in the photos from the hospital. What are you talking about? Oh, my God, it was you? You're the one who tried to poison Olivia? Amanda, you're confused. I would never do such a thing. You said the person was wearing a hooded sweatshirt. You wore the sweatshirt because I told you about it, and you wore my scarf to make me look like the suspect! That's outrageous. You've lost your mind. No, I saw... the hospital videos. Someone was clearly wearing this scarf. - Amanda, you can't be serious. - No! Admit it! Caroline, you did this, admit it! Admit it! You did this! I... I was doing it for us. You know as well as I do that Jack and Rachel should be together. They're perfect. You've clearly lost touch with reality. Think about it. Jack would have no one else to turn to, Rachel would be there to console him in his grief and eventually, they'd realize what you and I know. They're meant for each other. Caroline, you're clearly insane. Listen... it can still work. You and I could help her have a little accident. And she'd be out of our lives for good. I never wanted Olivia to be hurt. I just wanted to make sure she was who she said she was. You know what? I'm calling the police and if you have any morals left, you will do the right thing. I did it for us! Don't you get it?! No! Mrs. Finley! Oh, oh... Oh, thank God, Louise, you saved my life. Oh, I told you Mrs. Finley, I'd be right there for you. This is my mother's house. I'm gonna go check on her. Okay. - Mom! - Oh, Jack. Oh, I'm so glad you're here. - Are you okay? - It was terrible, I mean, she tried to kill me. It's okay. You're safe now. Ah, is um, is Victor here? He's on his way. You've seen the photos? Yes, Mom. There's an explanation, I promise. I know. I know. It was her brother. Yeah... Jack, I just want to say how sorry I am for doubting you. I've been such a fool. Just forget about it. Did Caroline...? Oh, she uh, she survived the fall, she's in the hospital. Thank God Louise was here. I don't know what would have happened had she not been. Listen, uh... I need to speak with Olivia. Let's just... Wait. We need to get you upstairs so you can rest, okay? We'll do that later. Jack... I need to speak with her. Please. Okay. I'll talk to you later. Olivia. Mrs. Finley, I'm so glad you're okay. It must have been horrific. I'm... a little shaken, but more importantly, I owe you an apology. I overstepped bounds and I... just let my general mistrust of people cloud my judgment. It's not something I'm proud of, and I'm deeply sorry. Thank you, for your honesty. Do you think that... we could try again to get to know each other? Yeah, I'd really like that. Great. Um... how's your brother? Um, fine. We're working through things. Jack's been very supportive. He's found him a few opportunities at INTEX. I should have been honest about my family. Family can be complicated. Right, Mom? It certainly can be. Let's get you upstairs so you can rest. Um, coffee tomorrow? Yes. If you're up for it. There's nothing I'd like more. Okay. Come on. Let's go. I'll be right back. Hmm. I got you. That's my family in there. Where's Amanda? Um, Jack just took her upstairs to rest. Thanks. I'm gonna go check on her. I want to give credit where credit is due. The information you provided Jack helped us uncover a criminal scam that was run by an employee of ours, Stan Wu. He was embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars and attempting to cover his tracks by setting you up. I figured it was something like that, but I never would've suspected Stan Wu was the one who attacked me. Yeah. Neither would we. The FBI's involved. He won't get far. Good. I'm so glad this is over. I'm sorry you had to go through all this. I truly am. - Thank you. - Hey. Hey. How is she? She's resting, but she wants to see you. Okay. Good work. Wasn't me who figured it out. Let's go home. Yes! - Rachel. - Jack. Thank you for meeting me. Uh, Rachel, this is Olivia. Olivia, this is Rachel. - Hi. - Hi. It's nice to meet you. I wanted to see you in person to apologize for my mother. It seemed she just got fixated on us. She's getting help now. It was a terrible thing she did. I appreciate you reaching out. She'll remain in custody for... the foreseeable future. She won't be causing any more trouble. Please tell your mother. I will. It must be so hard to see your mom go through that. I can't say it's been easy. Took a lot for you to come here and apologize. I hope you two have a wonderful wedding. I wish you nothing but the best. Bye. I like her. She didn't have to do that. Mmhmm. Gotta say, it's a relief that her mom's not gonna be coming around anymore. And I would definitely not let Louise go, that's for sure. Why do you say that? I think your mom will be safe as long as that woman is around. I would trust her with my life. Hmm. Would you trust me with your life? I do. We'll be together soon, sweetheart. Subtitling: difuze
