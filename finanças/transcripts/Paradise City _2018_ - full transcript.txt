(atmospheric music) (atmospheric electronic music) (breathes deeply) (curious music) - Brother... this is your time to shine. You are the cause of what you cause, man, so be careful what you cause. Let's do what the average mind can't do. Sacrifice. You've been poor all your life, man. Now's your time to get rich off your greatest deed. You're a cop, man. You ain't no criminal. Stand up for your community right now. You know I love you, brother. You know it's genuine. Can I get that love back? Can I get some balance? (crying) (tense music) Put that down, man. (crying) You know it wasn't me, brother. You know it wasn't. (coughing) I'm not scared of you, brother. I don't hold no ill will towards you. I only show you mercy. As a matter of fact, I forgive you. Love is love? (tense music) Respect. (gun bangs) (man crying) - A long time ago... I remember heading to the yard. I saw my man Cito Caban wearing a straw hat with a stick in his mouth, reading a book. I said, "Papito, what you doing, man?" He said, "Yo, Pi, I'm in Puerto Plata, papi. I got my feet in the sand and the sun shining on my face." I remember going back to my cell with goosebumps on my back and watery eyes. Because I'm like Cito Caban, I didn't have the vision to carve out my piece in this hell that we was living. (stirring music) (overlapping speech) - Hold on. Tonight, federal authorities, as you know, have announced that they have credible information that terrorists are plotting an attack in the coming few days. Now, at the moment, this threat has not been corroborated. The NYPD has deployed additional resources around the city, and it has taken on the steps to keep our city safe. Here's what you all need to do. If you see something, you say something. That's always been true. Over the next few days, let's all of us keep our eyes wide open. Let's go. Keep your eyes wide open. - Bianca Holmgren. (train clanking) - Bianca Holmgren, we told you how her brand new book is generating a kind of feminist firestorm. It's in part because of her blunt talk about the leadership ambition gap between working men and women. She is the head of a Holmgren Organization, the now iconic New York real estate dynasty. - This book is about helping women know they can reach for opportunities, so that one day we can live in a world where women have equal representation. Wouldn't that be amazing? - Tell me about your brother. The one who lives on the street. - He is finding himself, and when he is ready, we will welcome him back with open arms. Heck, he may even run our philanthropy division giving back to the homeless. - Your father trusted his advisors. In difficult times he trusted them. - [Bianca] I'm not scared of making money. The decision is already made. - With my hourglass dwindling, I wish to make one final executive decision. From this day forward... what remains of my fortune... will be donated entirely... to the poor and disenfranchised. (applause) - We need your companies in the South Bronx. Without those holdings, we have no deal. - [Man] It turns out those holdings were transferred to an estranged member of the family prior to Seymour passing. (hollering) (frenetic string music) - Yesterday afternoon, counter-terrorism officials brought down an al-Qaeda operative. Special agents like our very own Jim Colon here did outstanding work tracking down this individual and containing the threat he posed to our city. Now, let me make some observations here. Let's make sure we never forget that freedom is more powerful than fear. As long as we hold true to that tradition, I have no doubt that America will prevail. (camera snaps) (languid bass music) (coughs) (hacking) - What are we doing? You know... got a little out of hand there last night, Smooch. Might need to go get yourself checked. Ooh-ee. What do you think, Smooch? Yah, no, I'm hungry too, but... that just means we gotta put the work in, right? Time's money, Smooch. Let's get to work. We're gonna pick up some ladies. We're gonna get ourselves some drinks and, hey... we're gonna do it all over again tonight, right, baby? You gotta put on the happy face, 'cause otherwise we ain't gonna make good business. So let's get to going. (coughs) Thank you. Thank you so much. Sorry. Sorry, ladies and gentlemen. Oh my good God. Ah. ♪ Hey pretty lady ♪ ♪ Girl you're looking good ♪ ♪ Why don't you come round here ♪ ♪ Wish you would ♪ ♪ I'm not crazy just a little insane ♪ ♪ Why don't you take my hand ♪ ♪ I'll show you my pain ♪ Wait, you like that? That was a compliment. (chattering) Excuse me, miss. Can I steal a bandage? 'Cause I think I hurt my knee falling for you. ♪ Don't be afraid ♪ ♪ Of my little boy Smooch. ♪ ♪ He's a wonderful doggie ♪ ♪ That likes to lick for a hobby ♪ What was that? Nah, that was ugly. They're always looking at you for material kind of shit, right? (hacking) What do you grade that, Smooch? What would you grade? Thicker than a bowl of oatmeal right there, Smooch. - Young man, what seems to be the problem? - Uh, nothin' much, mister officer. I'm just... I'm sharing my gift with the community on a bright sunshiny afternoon like this. How you doin'? - Pretty good. My brother, you don't look too good though. I ain't gonna lie to you. You're gonna cut yourself on some glass any minute. - Oh, yeah. I've been meaning to get that fixed. Yeah, nothing a little duct tape cam fixed though. I appreciate the concern. Thank you. Bye. All right, wait. Hey, do you want me to sing you a song? You like that shuck and jive stuff, right? I know you. He likes that shuck and jive stuff, don't you? All right, I got you, man, but it's pay to play, so uh, make it count. You better- Best pull out that wallet. - You need to get in touch with social services, man. They can help you get a room, connect you with your family. One step at a time, man. - Family. He wants to reconnect me with my family, man. You drink? - Negative. Alcohol is a poison, my brother. I don't do that. - You snooze, you lose. More for me. - Devil's spirit. (laughs) Listen, we 'bout to go celebrate Allah's blessings. Why don't you come inside for a minute, get yourself cleaned up. - Ah, no, I'm good, man. Me and Smooch here, we're about to bounce. But thanks for the offer. - Looks like your dog can use some help too. Come on, man. (curious music) Come on. (chattering) - Brother Hamid, can you get this brother a proper wash and some sandals? Come in. Get his dog something to eat too. - Yeah, 'cause I can't stay more than five minutes. Compensation, unless you got it, you know what I mean? Is you paying me? - As-salamu alaykum. - [Men] Wa alaykumu s-salam. - My brothers, how y'all feeling today? (speaking in foreign language) I want you to meet two new Muslims to our masjid today. Brother Asif here. Where he's at? Come on, brother. Come up to the front. Just converted to Islam and received the Shahada. We are jealous of you as you stand here shining in your purity. We unfortunate have accumulated some misdeeds since Allah accepted us to Islam, but we are all a work in progress. Ain't that right, brothers? - [Men] That's right. - And brother Farouk is new to our neighborhood and just moved to our community. So we must offer our hospitality and our brotherhood, which to us Muslims, this bond is thicker than blood. To us, this bond transcends all race, nationality and gender. (applause) - Okay. - So what are we doing, mani-pedi or what? - What are you on, man? - Oh, me? Oh... I'm as clean as a whistle, my man. - Okay, sure. These are just mosquito bites, huh? - You must be some kind of scholar or something. You get your PhD or something? (chuckles) (curious music) - I just got one question I like to ask our brothers. Are you a cop? (anxious music) - No, sir. (speaking in foreign language) - Are you the FBI? - Nah, man. Fuck the police. (chuckling) - No, no brother. We don't talk like that. We show respect and we offer grace. Now, I know you're new to Islam, so we can be patient with each other. It's all good, brother. But I do have a message for any informants that may be in the room. If you are with the NYPD, we do not tolerate violence against any particular people or groups. But I do have a message for any informants or undercovers in the room. If you are with the NYPD or the FBI, I welcome you. And that's true talk. We know that you are here, and we hope that you will benefit and grow spiritually as a result of your time in our community. Just know, if you ever decided to become a Muslim and cross that line like brother Asif here, once you bear witness that there's no God but Allah Muhammad (speaking in foreign language) is the messenger, We believe that everything you did up until that moment will be washed away. You'll be a brand-new person. And when that happens, you'll start to see people act differently, and you will see some pretty wonderful things take place, inshallah. Let us embrace our brothers. (speaking in foreign language) - This some kind of cult or something? You boys just sit around and drink Kool-Aid all day? Does anybody actually work around here? - You of all people should be the last person to pass judgment. - No, I'm just saying. You got to such soft hands, mister. That means you never worked a day in your life. You're a gentle man, like me. (chanting in foreign language) - Here. For your feet. Now, go about your business. And don't ever disrespect again. Ever. We can only help the people who want to help themselves. - If I disrespected you, I apologize. (applause) Okay. - Embrace your brothers, man. (chattering) - I mean, the thought of you hating me would be absolutely devastating. - Don't forget your guitar. - Thanks to these. And... - [Hamid] Peace be upon you. - Yeah, yeah. Peace be upon you too. I got my guitar, and I'm gonna take my dog. Where'd you bums put Smooch? Huh? Smooch! Let's get outta here, Smooch! The place is corrupt! Leaving this shit hole! Where'd you bums put Smooch, huh? You're being lied to! Do you understand? Nobody cares about you! Nobody cares! And nobody's ever gonna do shit for you! What, you think people care about you when you go out in the street? Nobody cares about you! Huh? - Don't worry about that, brothers and sisters. He don't know no better. - I'm gonna take these, I'm gonna take this, and I'm gonna take my dog! And screw you all! (soft music) - There's a history of violence in your family. Your old man died in prison. Your mother OD'ed on crack cocaine. And your brother is serving a life sentence in Sing Sing. Must have been something in the water in the Colon residence. - At a young age, I figured I'd do the right thing. - Do you know what we do here? - [Colon] Counter-terrorism, sir. - [Chief] We protect the homeland. - Sign me up. - His name is Andre Davis. Convicted murderer, con-artist, and now radical Islamic fundamentalist. He converted a few years ago in jail to impress the judge. He got off on some fabricated DNA bullshit. We want you to stop him. (anxious music) (car horns honking) - Hey, hey! You! Get back over here! - Hey! Can't you see I'm walking here? Get your head out your ass! - I'm sorry. - [Handicapped Man] You gonna help out a Gulf War hero or what? - I'm sorry. - I fought for your freedom, nigga! That's how you repay me? Shit! - [Farouk] Hey, hey! Come over here! You! I saw what you did over there. Come over here. Get over here! - Hey, 50 bucks if you want to lick the hog. A clean hundred if if you want to suck my ass, okay? - Do I strike you as that kind of guy? - Yeah, you do. You kind of little nasty little Nancy. I seen your culty type here before. Hey, he wants to suck my dick, everybody! - The fuck are you talking about, huh? I never seen you in my life. - You got a little potty mouth now, huh? You a bad boy, huh? You want a chocolate sundae all over your chest? - Listen. How 'bout we start over, huh? I'm gonna introduce myself to you, first time. Farouk. - Farouk? Yeah, well, whatever you think I did, I didn't do it. And I ain't going back to that shelter, thank you very much. - Do me a favor, all right? Don't come back to this mosque. Two, don't steal from those people. They're good people, all right? And they don't deserve that. If you want food, you ask for it like a man. (coughing) Now give it to me. You understand what I'm saying? (spits) - Yeah, well, I don't know what you're talking about. Give me the money. Now give me the money. Come on. - What money? Huh? - Come on. I know you got it in your pockets. That's a good guy. Huh? Good guy. Thank you. - Hey! Hey, kiss my ass, motherfucker! (smacks butt) Right here! Wee-hoo! Bitch! (soft music) - I like coming up here, Murdoch. Get away from it all. Looking at these symbols... reminds me of why we do what we do. Cigar? - Sure. - Protection. Above all else, that's what the public desires. Safety for their loved ones. Peaceful environment. Make a decent living. You'd be surprised the concessions people make for their civil assurance. I didn't risk my life in that sandbox for you to play identity politics. - Politics? That's no place for a soldier, Murdoch. It requires conscience. If all soldiers had that, hell, we'd have no army. - Soft power only works on soft things, Commissioner. Man has a dark side. (unsettling music) I've seen it personally. This world is evil. - [Commissioner] I can't imagine what you saw out there, but undoubtedly some pretty horrific stuff. (stressful music) - [Murdoch] That's life, Commissioner. Daily battle of attrition. (gun pops) - Just bring me my collars so we can keep this federal funding coming through, which, let's not forget, means that you and all your men get compensated accordingly. If not, well, you could always explore the alternative financial package. Down at the VA's pension office. - Autonomy is what I need. No oversight. No questions. - I bet you think your brother would still be alive if he didn't skip town. - No. My brother would still be alive if these bureaucrats didn't let these savages run the streets unaccounted for. And that's the loss I plan to reconcile. - Let's go Smooch. (door chimes) Okay, right here, right here. Okay, Smoochie, you're gonna stay right here. Daddy's gonna get you some food. Okay, boy? Hey... just a couple of these. Listen, man, I don't want any trouble. I just... if you could get me this food and a little bit of money, that would be great. - I told you never to fucking come back here! - I just, you know, my dog's hungry. I need a little bit of cash. I promise you won't see me again, okay? Just- - Told you not to come back here anymore. - I just want this. - You need to leave, please. - My dog's hungry. - Just go, okay? - You know what I mean? My dog's hungry. I- - [Cashier] You need to go to the shelter, all right? You need to leave here and go to the shelter, please. - I know, I know. - Go to the shelter! They have food there. Just go, okay? Just please go. - If I could just get the food in a bag, that would be fucking fabulous! - [Cashier] You need to get out of here right now before I call the cops. - Listen, asshole! I need the fucking food! I need the money! Open the fucking register, okay? Give me the fucking money! Give me the fu- Okay. Okay. Okay, you want to fucking blow my brains out? Go ahead. Go ahead. You want to fucking blow my brains out? Go ahead! I ain't afraid to die! Shoot! Shoot! - I will shoot you! - Do it! - I will fucking kill you! - Do it! Shoot! (punches) Give me the fucking money. Open the register! - Get the fuck out of here! - Give me the fucking money! - It's locked, you stupid shit! I'm gonna call the police, you stupid shit! Get the fuck out of here! (overlapping shouts) - What? - What are you looking at? - Looking at your fucking dirty ass! What you want? You wanna fucking square up, cunt? - Get the fuck outta here. Nobody wants you here. - Get the fuck out of here! I will call the cops! - Okay, I'm gonna take this shit. I'm gonna fucking take this. - [Woman] Get the fuck outta here! - Fuck you! Oh, okay. - Get the fuck outta here! - Fucking shower! - Bitch! - Nobody wants you here! - Take a fucking shower. - Fuck you, huh? Fuck you! What are you gonna do? - Get the fuck out! - Let's go, Smooch. Let's go. - Get the fuck out of here! - I'm gonna enjoy myself a nice bag. (overlapping shouts) - Help! - Fucking dirty ass! - [Reporter] In today's real estate news, after a series of contentious negotiations, the biggest private real estate development in the South Bronx has been put on hold. - When I was a little girl, my father used to say, "Bianca, if you're going to be thinking anything, you might as well be thinking big." (chuckles) He taught me to be a dreamer, and perhaps more importantly to be a doer, to execute and stand by while others bear witness. (applause) Some would say we have reached the mountaintop, but I say that is not high enough. (applause) (doleful music) (car horns honking) (chattering) (whistles) (whistles) - Hey! - As-salamu alaykum, brothers. - [Group] Wa alaykumu s-salam. - And my sisters. My dear brothers and sisters, we are at war. Not with America, not with the West, but with our own people. There are those within Islam trying to hijack particular verses from the Quran, the most beautiful words to ever come off the tongue, and twist them to inflict harm on other people. Now, I remind them that the word Islam literally translates to "peace". Peace! And I know that (speaking in foreign language) has blessed us to be a community that is not extreme. So it bothers me that we have certain individuals who do not value human life. Now, this war will not be one but violence and politics. The war of all wars, the war of ideas... will be won by mankind's greatest weapon. Love. (chattering) Love. So today I ask, inshallah, that you use this weapon to spread goodness. Because this conflict is gonna come to an end. And those of us that have the courage to stand on the right side of history will be rewarded by Allah and seated next to him in paradise, inshallah. So may Allah aid us in our position, keep us strong as a community, and plant our feet firmly on goodness. As-salamu alaykum. - [Group] Wa alaykumu s-salam. - May Allah accept our prayer. Appreciate you, man. - Allahu Akbar. - Brother. Hasid. - Thank you so much. - Ah, thank you, brother. Thank you. (soft music) Farouk, how are you? I knew you would come back, my brother. This is your home now. We're not here to judge you, brother. We're here to bond. (gentle vocal music) It's okay. That pain now. (crying) Come on, brother. It's gonna be all right. (crying) It's all good, man. It's God, brother. For you. Let's make dua for our brothers, man. (speaking in foreign language) - [Group] Allahu Akbar. (applause) - That's the sign of mercy right there. Brother Farouk, please lead is in dua, man. Make prayer for us. (upbeat music) - Of course. Yeah. Um... Maybe I should just read from the text so it can be precise. - Nah, nah. From the heart, brother. From the heart, brother Farouk. - I mean... what verse? - Any of your choosing. Recite whatever you want. - I'd much rather read it from the text. I'm thinking that I don't want to mess it up. (anxious music) - Allah's mercy. (laughing) Who is that? - This is America! - What is he doing? - Fuck all your terrorists! All of you are terrorists. All you bitches. And you know what I got for terrorists? I got something for you. This is what I think of terrorists. - [Nazim] What is you doing? (shouting) (stark bass music) - Alistair. Alistair! - Oh, back up! - Alistair, Alistair. - Back up! - No! - Calm down. (smashes guitar) - Get back! - Alistair, for Christ's sake! - Get away from me! Get away from me! - Calm down! Your father's dead! - This evening, at approximately 10:05... my father was found asleep at his study. (gasping) He passed away doing what he loves most, seeing to business. (gasping) Effective immediately, I will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. (gasping) - He's dead. Okay? Just... Just- - [Alistair] Get the fuck away from me, Douglas. - Come home. - This is my home. This is my home. - Okay, but I'll tell you this, go see a doctor. You're too young to die. Go see a doctor! - End your miserable fucking life, you piece of shit! - We need you home. You know where to find me. You're too young to die, son. Go see a doctor. Get in the car. - Hold this. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. May I have your attention please? I'm not gonna take up too much of your time. I'm not gonna sing or dance or take up your whole afternoon. I just want to let you know that, inside of this briefcase, inside my pockets, I have a boatload of cash. That's cash money! Which I want to hand out to you all today. So I'm gonna come around now. Please, please, don't freak out. This is real money, no counterfeit bills, No food stamps, just cold hard biscuit. - I need some of that. - There you go. Hey! Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah, it is real money. There you go. Yeah! Yes! - I'll take it. - Yeah, people, take it. It's all right. It's all yours. It's all yours, all yours. Take it. I don't need it. It's all right. I got plenty more. Get that briefcase open. I'm gonna be coming around for some more. That's all right. Please, please, take some. See, I know you all may be wondering why... why I would do such a thing. Well, truth is I'm dying, you know. I don't have... I don't have much time left. - [Passenger] May God bless you. And it's in the card of some kinda... I don't know the scientific name behind it, but... - [Passenger] I'll pray for you. - It's just... It's a reminder for all of us to live life to the fullest. - [Passenger] Amen. - 'Cause you never know when the big man upstairs, he's gonna hand you that pink slip. So please accept the spare change. My ticker is blacker than a coal miner's asshole, so... (laughing) take it, take it, it's all yours. Even you, sir. You look like somebody who likes to help people. Oh, come on. Hey, if you were to give me cash, I'd accept it from you, so here you go. Hey, man, maybe someday you'll offer me spare change, and I'll accept your offer. There you go. - Take it. - I'll take it. - I'm good, bro. - Aw, that's a shame. That's a shame. Who thinks I should sing to this man so that he may accept my spare change? (cheering) That's right! That's right! Okay, if you know the words to the song, sing it! ♪ I know you want to leave me ♪ (laughs) ♪ I refuse to let you go ♪ Eh! ♪ Oh uh oh ♪ ♪ Ooh uh oh ♪ Come on! ♪ Ooh uh oh ♪ ♪ Ooh uh oh ♪ ♪ If I got to beg or plead for you sympathy ♪ ♪ Oh I got something around this way ♪ (laughing) Accept the spare change, please, on behalf of a Muslim. Have a blessed day, and, hey, may your luck come out just as good as mine. - Go fuck yourself, man. - [Passenger] Come one. Why you gotta do that? - I don't need your dirty prostitute money. Why don't you go out and get a real fucking job like the rest of us here. You know, it's people like you who are ruining this city. Hurry up and die, asshole. - [Passenger] Fuck him, bro. Fuck him, bro. Fuck him up, bro. He's talking crazy. - Did you just call me an asshole? - I didn't stutter, did I? - Considering we share the same prison purse, I'll let that one slide. Now, if you call me a snapperhead... then we would have a problem. - I speak English, bro. You're still an asshole. - [Passenger] Come on, guy. - Well, you didn't call me a snapperhead, so you're still good in my books. - Get ... a fucking job... You fucking snapperhead! - [Passenger] Oh! Beat him! (chuckles) Bro, violate him. Violate him, bro. - Merry Christmas. Oh my God, you are beautiful. Anybody tell you that? You are beautiful. Please, accept this spare change. - Well, sir... Now... Now you've just earned yourself... a new fucking asshole. - Fuck you, man! (shouting) (soft music) (laughing) - Be playing so much. - What? - All right, all right, what's the next topic? Because- - Okay, okay. - Who's the greatest basketball player ever? You can pick one, only one. - Come on, man, that's too easy. Dr. J. Julius Irvin, baby. - I like Magic, man. Showtime. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. How can all of you mentioned all these names, and not mention Michael Jordan, the GOAT, the greatest ever? - Wow! - I'm gonna give you that. I'm gonna give you that. - Wrong. - [Farouk] Right or wrong? - Wrong. - Don't give me that LeBron crap, man. - Wrong again. - Let me Find out you one of them Kobe fan boys, man. Without Shaq, he's just another Clyde Drexler. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, anybody who shoots 50 times is bound to hit a bucket or two. - All right, so who you got, brother? - Number 33. The hick from French Lick, Indiana. Larry Bird. (groaning) - Hell no! You're crazy that all outdoors. - You know how I know he's the greatest? - 'Cause you never played ball. I saw you move around with those two left feet of yours. (laughing) - That's the point exactly. Anybody who can't run or can't jump, can't pivot, has no hip direction whatsoever, but still hits 30 and 10 every time he steps on the floor, that's skill! - Ah, hell no, man. Are you serious? - Larry Bird! - This guy needs to get out of the car right now. - True. Man, pull this van over. This man has lost his damn mind. (overlapping speech) ♪ This little light of mine ♪ ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ (laughs) ♪ This little light of mine ♪ ♪ Woo ♪ (laughing) ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ ♪ This little light of mine ♪ ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ ♪ Let it shine let it shine ♪ ♪ Let it shine ♪ (laughing) - [Farouq] That don't make him a greatest, bro. Believe that. (chatter on police radio) - [Nazim] What the fuck is going on? What is this? (chatter on police radio) - There's been a call put out for vehicles that match this description. - Officer, do we got anything to worry about, man? - Follow my instructions, sir, we won't have a problem, okay? Pass me the paperwork. - This isn't my van. It belongs to somebody in my congregation. - Is this vehicle stolen? - No, it's not stolen. - No. We're not showing you anything. - Was I talking to you, sir? - We're not gonna show him shit. What's the violation? You didn't tell us why you stopped us. - [Officer] Was I talking to you, sir? - I'm talking to you. Put your hands on the dashboard, both of you, now! Put your hands on the dashboard, both of you! Is there a weapon in this vehicle? - There's no weapon in the vehicle, officer, Can I get you the paperwork so we can be on our way please? We ain't looking for no trouble. - [Officer] Shut up! - I apologize for that, officer. Just had a long day. - Why the fuck would we have a weapon in the vehicle? - We're searching this van. All right, let's get out. - [Farouk] I'm gonna get your badge number! - Slowly. - [Farouk] I'm gonna file a full complaint! - Is that necessary? - That's illegal! That's illegal! - [Officer] Get out of the van! Let's go! - That's illegal! - Let's go! Hands up against the- (window shattering) (fire whooshing) Put your hands on the fucking vehicle! Do you understand? You got any sharp objects on you that I should be made aware of? - You have no reason to suspect anything going on with this van! You have no suspicion whatsoever to stop us for what you just stopped us for. There's no justifiable reason. No reason whatsoever! - You some kinda goddamn lawyer? - No, I'm not a lawyer, but I know my rights! - [Handicapped Man] That's right, motherfuckers. Shock and awe. (snickering) I call this the Desert Storm revenge. (cackling) (boxes tumbling) - Hey! Get down on the ground now! Hey! Get down on the ground now! - [Asif] I'm sorry! - You make the wrong move, you're gonna get in trouble! - Put your hands on your head! - If you move! - Interlace your fingers now! - I'm sorry. - Interlace your fingers! Get up! - [Asif] I'm sorry, man. - You're under arrest for threatening behavior towards a law enforcement agent. - Sir- - Shut up! - I just want to go home, man. - You're under arrest. If you make a mistake, you're gonna get hurt! - [Nazim] Asif, it's not worth it, Asif! - [Asif] I'm sorry, man. We're just trying to get home, man. - [Officer] Shut up! - I just want to get home. (fire crackling) - [Officer] Yeah, we checked everything there. There's nothing here, just toys and stuffed animals. Something about charity. Should we let 'em go? - Sir, there's no explosives in the vehicle. Somebody must have taken them out before they took off. - [Murdoch] Look, you just do your job. I want Andre Davis. - Where the fuck is Murdoch? Huh? I'm talking to you, Captain. - He's finishing your homework, kid. - Finishing my homework? What are you talking about? What's going on out there, huh? I almost got shot by one of my own men. - You're taking too long, Colon. We should've had a terror plot by now. - It's not a sting. I thought this was surveillance, not a sting. Like, my ass is on its own out there. Understand? - Nazim can smell you from a mile away, which is why we've been forced to take preemptive measures. - Preemptive measures, what does that mean? - We need blow backs, son. Because any minute, this son of a bitch is about to go public and we're all out of a job. - [Officer] Jimmy, relax. Come on. Take a walk. Let's go. - [Captain] Thankfully, Murdoch's out there cleaning up your fucking mess as we speak. - Ah, come on. Fuck you! I'm trying everything in my powers. In fact, they're not saying any of the shit that you claiming that they're saying. You know what I'm starting to believe? That Nazim is nothing like what Murdoch says he is, - Well, you see, that's what terrorists do. They make you sympathize with their cause and then they fuck you in the ass. - Well, you do me a favor, all right? You tell Murdoch to let me do my job. And if he has a problem, tell him to come see me. In fact, if it's so easy, you talk to with a gauze and see if he could do what I do, 'cause none of you motherfuckers could do what I do! You hear me? - Son, we're gonna give you one more chance to set 'em up. It's time to back them into a corner. We just need you to not fuck it up. (emotional string music) - He planning an attack, man. - [Murdoch] That's not enough, Mr. Andre Davis. - You know that's not my name anymore. - Why not? - What's wrong with that nice Christian name your mama gave you? - They said if you see something, say something. Well, I'm here. - You tell anybody else about this? - Nah, I came here first. - Good. Not a word gets out to the public. - Ain't that the point of all of this? I don't even know what we're talking about right here. You need to be out there doing something about this instead of in here talking to me. - For all I know, this could be a bait and switch scheme. - That ain't got nothing to do with me. Nothing. - You Muslims think you're tough shit, don't you? Slapping your women. Cuttin' their clits off. Make 'em dress like the fucking Grim Reaper. Why don't you try slapping me around, tough guy? - You must not know my wives. And smacking you around would be too easy. - [Murdoch] Yeah. (bangs table) - He's not even a real Muslim, man. He don't know how to make salat. He don't know how to make prayer. And now he's recruiting law-abiding Muslims with cold, hard cash. - My man, with your criminal record, I take your word with a grain of salt. - I could tell you want people to get hurt so you could turn around and say they came out of my mosque. - Not if you help us stop 'em. - Help you? You buggin'. That's your job. And if you don't do something about this, I will. - You get him in the room with explosives, I'll bring this whole thing to an end. - Brother, what do I know you from? - You did your country a service today, Mr. Davis. You should be proud. - Look real familiar. (tense music) Real familiar. - I know every crack addict here within a seven mile radius. Every one of them. More kind, more honest, more giving... than any of the rich scumbags I grew up with. So, me... I'm free. (soft music) - You know there's other ways of making money. You don't have to put your fucking neck on the line for nothing but pennies. - Cops do that shit every day, except they got a team behind 'em, and that's what I was fucking doing. That's my team. Just like you got the mosque, you got your brotherhood. I don't exactly fit into that, So I've gotta fit in somewhere. So leave me the fuck alone. (soft music) - There's one thing I give a fuck about, bro. - What's that? - And that's smooch. Always loves me. Never gonna leave me. Got my back 24-fucking-seven. That's right. - Know what you sound like? You sound like you got some daddy issues. You sound like your father fondled your little wee wee. (chuckling) - If only he was that affectionate. (bright music) - At least you had a father. All I would have is a window that would separate us. Motherfucker spent his whole life in jail, bro. - Hey, maybe that's where my old man belonged. Then again, where would I have gotten all my colorful pills from? Yeah, they told me I was very special child, indeed. Pill, pill, pill. "You're very special, Alistair." Pill, pill, pill. (chuckles) Oh, I'm very special indeed. (atmospheric music) - You know, I've-I've always wanted to be different from my father. But here I am. I am in a fucking alleyway... with a motherfucking junkie. (chuckles) No offense. You're a good dude. I don't even know who I am anymore. (curious bass music) I don't. I don't know who I am. Don't know what I'm doing. I'm just as fucking bad as you are, man. - You sound like you're overthinking way too much, Farouk. Take a hit. This is the real deal, so stop staring and start daring, brother. (siren blaring) - This shit ain't approved by the FDA, man. - Fuck the FDA. This is a dope disguised as a Happy Meal, man. - I got a prescription for this shit. Look, I got my name on it. (chuckling) Shit, I've got my name on it. Ah, fuck it. - That's right. (lighter clicks) Yeah. (laughing) Now you're you! Now you're the real you. You're free, just like me. (laughing) - Now to a possible arson attack in the Bronx. As flames tore through a withering Cypress Avenue mosque, in what investigators call a suspicious fire. This would not be the first time a possible hate crime has afflicted this community. QBS News's Susan Connors is live on the scene. And it would appear this blaze has claimed the life of a young child. (somber music) - I should have been there. I let him take my boy. - How do you want to be remembered by your family? As a coward? Or as a martyr? - We have to fight back. We have to act now. If not, we cease to exist. - 'Cause I'll be damned if I sit around and let them kill my loved ones. - When does it end, huh? You tell me. If I killed, then they will kill again. And the cycle just goes on and on and on. - [Asif] Brother Farouk is right. It is not violence if it is self-defense. - Come on, turn this off. I can't watch anymore. - [Alistair] We're being tested, brothers. Allah is just separating the pious from the wicked. Maybe I'm a little confused, but... Wasn't Allah supposed to be the one to stop this from happening? I mean, like he's in charge, right? - [Nazim] Well, to be honest, I used to ask myself that every day when I was locked up. - Locked up? - Yeah. Before I took responsibility for my actions, I used to get myself into all sorts of drama, man, running around, raising havoc with the old crew. We used to call ourself the Do Brothers. Used to do work, do damage, do drugs, do mega sex. And of course, I was Mr. Do. We used to meet up in the park every night and buy drugs from the older brothers that they stole from other cats. And believe me, we made it rain on all them crack heads and dope fiends. Type of money I was getting at 17? I was shining. Gold, clothes, and bank rolls. But little did I know, them fake ass niggas was cops. And then, boom! Officer down. Now I'm doing 15 years in Elmira prison. - So this whole time you... you been frontin' like you was a saint. You been preaching to people about God, but you've got blood on your hands. - His man did it. But my looks fit the crime, so I took the fall. - Man, I ain't buying none of that bacon. - I'm innocent! I ain't got to prove that to you, my brother - All right, you don't have prove nothing to me. You ain't a preacher. You a killer. - Shut the hell up! Show some fucking respect! Watch your fucking mouth, you hear me? (shouting) - Do something. Do something. - Get out of of my house! - Relax. Relax. They want y'all to fight amongst each other, man. They want y'all to fight amongst each other and kill each other! So they don't gotta do it. Come on, brothers. Dig in. Where's your faith? Where's your iman? - You have any loved ones, brother Farouk? Where's your family? (soft music) 'Cause my family is... gone, and so I'm having a hard time understanding why I need to take the lives of so many people to save my own. - We need justice for peace, brother. We need justice. - Here's to jihad. It's all right. We can forget our troubles. - Why you bring him, man? - You a little stressed there? Looks like you need a little drink, No? All me then. - We can't trust him, Farouk. - Yeah, you can't trust me. It's all right. 'Cause it's my fault. I'm the bad guy here. Yeah. I'm the white man, right? The man? Blame it on the man. It's all right. You can put the blame on me. 'Cause you don't know me. You don't know me. But I got something for y'all. (anxious music) - [Reporter] Back now to our top story. Authorities say they have intercepted plans of men discussing intentions to set off bombs in Midtown Manhattan. - [Reporter] Our Susan Connors is live at the QBS news center with the disturbing allegations laid out by intelligence officials. - Thank you, Jim. I'm here with Police Commissioner Richards, who wanted to personally issue this urgent warning to our city's residents. Police Commissioner, are you saying that an al-Qaeda operative has infiltrated a local mosque and is planning a terrorist attack because of the recent mosque fire? - That is correct, Susan. He's looking for locations to leave a van that would be packed with explosives. And he spoke extensively about taking targets like St. Patrick's cathedral off the map. - Is this our new normal, Mr. Commissioner? Why do we have to live in constant fear? - So let me make this clear to your audience. I think our boys have done an extraordinary job in keeping the city safe. Now ,every once in awhile, a bad apple may sneak through the cracks, and it's our job to quickly identify these individuals and smoke 'em out. (emotional vocal music) (coughing) (humming) - It's good to see you. - That's some good coffee. Thanks, Douggie boy. (laughs) Wow! This place looks different. What did you do, Missy? Place looks really nice. - A lot's changed. - Boy, hasn't it? (laughs) - Take a seat, Alistair. - Oh! Wait! Do you guys have it? Oh, no way! Wait, wait, wait! Did you move it? No! Why did you do that? There was a bookshelf right here. Used to be... it was my favorite book. And what was it called? It was... - "The Grinch"? - "The Grinch"! That's right, "The Grinch". Yeah, me, you and mom, we used to sit right here on this big old mat. It was a big old... what was it? - Rainbow mat. - The rainbow-colored mat. That's right. You remembered Yeah, we used to sit right here on that rainbow-colored mat, and she used to read us the story of the Grinch. Little shrinking heart. Shrink and shrink 'cause of all that hate. - Yeah, and then I'd have to finish reading, because mom would pass out. - 'Cause all those vitamins, right? (chuckles) Mm! Awfully nice renovation. Except this guy. Here's a new commodity. I don't like that jack-off. Get rid of him. What happened to this? Why is his picture gone? It was his favorite picture. The suit and tie. He was looking all nice and shit. - I'm redecorating. - Redecorating? Is that right? Really? Right, you're the boss now, so you can do whatever you want, right? So, we're here to talk... What are we here to talk about? - Look, Alistair, I know you may not believe me... but I have thought about you a lot. And... I want to help you. - Oh, that's sweet. I'm willing to offer you a significant amount of money for you to get yourself cleaned up and back on your feet. - Wait, how much are we talking here? Whoa! - $50,000 every month for the rest of your life. All you need to do... is sign right here. - That's amazing! You would do that for me? I mean, I don't even know if I can accept this. Wow. Okay. Your money doesn't mean shit to me. What'd you think, I'm just gonna walk back in after eight years of being treated like a piece of shit? Your money doesn't mean shit to me! See, this whole exchange is, how would you call it? Futile. - Alistair, I know that... somewhere behind this thing that you're doing... you're still hurting. Because the last time you were in this room... (unsettling music) mom killed herself because of you. So the least you can do... is transfer the property rights that father left in your name... over to me. - You're right. You know what, you're absolutely right. You're right. ♪ The candy man can ♪ ♪ Mixes it with love and makes the world go round ♪ Woo! ♪ Candy man can ♪ - What do you want? What the fuck do you want, Alistair? What do you want? (anxious string music) - You need to stop feeling sorry for yourself. I was there once before. Except I was hunkered down in a demolished building after I was cutting a sawed off. The last deployment in Iraq. The Battle of Ramadi. It was just me and my fellow soldier. And a little red dot. Waiting for you to move two inches to the right. One inch to the left. - You piece of shit. I knew you were a cop. - Stuck in the trenches. That unrelenting pressure hanging over your head. Knowing that, in that one solitary moment... everything's at stake. - There's a bomb parked in a car next to your police friend. - [Farouk] No, no, no, no, no. The bags are in the van. - [Hamid] No. I switched them. These are duds. - [Farouk] No. - [Hamid] Enter the code. (sighs) (emotional music) - You're not thinking about buying groceries or... paying your cell phone bill. You're just trying to keep each other alive. - You can't do that, man. I can't, I can't (gun bangs) (yelling) - Now... enter the fucking code. - That's brotherhood. That's love for your fellow man. (sighs) - I'm gonna ask you one more time! Turn on! - Fuck you! No! (gun bangs) (blood spurts) - We cried at each other's feet that night. And when I woke up... his skull was split open like a goddamn horseshoe. (breathing heavily) I eventually found that sniper. And put a bullet through his eye socket, just before taking his scalp and returning home. You know what I mean? - Fuck you... and your war stories. - You don't know what it's like. Returning home from war. Expecting a hero's welcome, like they show on TV on Veterans Day. Only to find out your younger brother's been killed in the line of duty. And no one even gave a shit to tell you about it. (distressing music) He was just like you. He wanted to do good and bring hope to this... to this godforsaken hell hole. You and me... we're family now. Family. (scoffs) - Family? - [Murdoch] Family. - No family. We'll never be family. You don't wear blue the way we do. I'm gonna expose you. You're gonna be all over the news. Yeah. Laugh. Crooked motherfucker. (chuckles) (emotional string music) (sighs) I didn't know you were gonna say that. I'm gonna give you one more chance, son. Criminal possession, distribution and use of heroin is a violation of federal and state law, punishable by up to nine years in prison. - I didn't sign up for this. Everything, it's a lie. - You bring me Andre Davis... and proof of the explosives in the mosque downtown, or you're gonna be eating prison guard salad for the rest of your life. - Can I get a nurse in here, please? I need more morphine. Nurse! (somber music) - [Reporter] In lower Manhattan, protesters vowed to stop the Islamic Cultural Center planned just two blocks north of ground zero. The unexpected donation comes from the Holmgren real estate family, a staple in New York's dynastic circles. Caught in the middle are Muslim Americans who say they just want a place to worship in peace. - Our charitable division is willing to donate this property to... El Haji Mosque... and its Iman, brother Nazim Abdul Rahim. (speaking foreign language) - Let us give thanks to Allah. (applauding) (laughing) - What's the damage? - Well, Alistair's current worth is $50 million. By all accounts, he intends to donate it all... to the Islamic Relief Fund. (laughing) - Oh, wow. He is a true Holmgren. A mover and a shaker. Tell me, Douglas, what's your commission? I beg your pardon? - How much is my brother paying you to bend me over? - Give me a break, Bianca. I warned you months ago that your father still had Alistair in his will, and you did nothing about it. It is a miracle that he did not leave him the entire fortune. - You will tell me where he sleeps, won't you? (anxious music) (calm vocal music) - Brother Alistair... you made history today. And for that we're forever grateful. - Ah, it's no biggie. You know, it's the least I can do. You guys helped me so much. You're like a family to me. This food, though. (chuckles) (soft music) (chattering) - Sir. I thought we were gonna speak in private. - Come on. We're all family here. The force is a brotherhood. Don't forget that. Have a seat, son. - Thank you. (package smacks) It's all there. Entrapment, personal vendettas. - So Murdoch's gone rogue, is that right? - He tried to plant IUDs in an innocent man's vehicle. You know it's against the law. Even worse, he put my life at risk with this bullshit sting operation. If that's not domestic terrorism, then I don't know what is. - You swore and oath of honor, son. You know, the one that says "I will not betray the badge." - "Or the public's trust." - You know, loyalty is a point of pride in this line of work. We expect the bad guys are hurting us, but not one of our own. The consequences can be dire. - I beg your pardon? - Self-preservation. If we continue like this, the three of us are gonna end up on the nightly news. (laughs) Police corruption scandal. Commissioner on trial. Quite frankly, nobody's got time for that. - Arrest him, make a public statement, then get back to work. - You know we got a rat problem in the department. What do you suggest we do with that? - Why don't we just take out the garbage? - Son, I understand that you may be dealing with a little trauma right now. It's gotten too personal for you. Clouding your judgment. Back in my day, we called it shell shock. - Hell, with PTSD, you might not even remember this conversation tomorrow. (laughing) - Listen, I got a great doctor. He'll get you straightened out. No deductible. We just need to know that you're going to be a team player. (tense music) - You gonna play ball, son? - I must say, I respect your integrity. I only wish we had more young officers like yourself, willing to put their necks on the line, check their superiors when there's signs of corruption or misconduct. You did good son. And who knows? After the dust clears, you may be up for a ranking officer. Sounds good. (dramatic music) Don't it? (groaning) (gun bangs) (slams gun) (yelling) (grunting) (gun bangs) - Alistair. Alistair, just listen to me, please. It's not a gun. You gotta listen to me. Just listen. I know what you're thinking of me. I know. And you're right. You've always been right. But Bianca, she's changed. She ain't the same. Please. Next time you talk to her here, you wear this. You wear it, and you do not trust her. (siren blaring) (intriguing music) - [Reporter] Now, still no sign tonight of a man police consider armed and dangerous. - This so-called cop killer is on the run after murdering high-ranking law enforcement officials. This is a crime that has gripped the city. Police are warning people in all five boroughs to be on the lookout. - And as the manhunt continues, fear is spreading that this fugitive may be linked to a larger swath of terrorist organizations plaguing our city. (grunting) - Listen to me, god damn it! Listen! Murdoch put a fucking hit on you, man! - Get the fuck off me! - He's gone rogue, man! Man, I knew you was wired up. So I took my hands off that van. Figured it would buy us more time. Help Murdoch finish the job. Shit. Should have let 'em pinch you right there. - We're just pawns, man. We're just fucking pawns in this corrupt game. - Listen to me. We both undercover. That means to we in this together, no matter what, because if they can flip it on you, they won't think twice about my shit. And I'm the only one that knows the truth. - And what's that? They control what's real now. Can't trust nobody. - [Asif] Brother Nazim can testify. - [Farouk] Not if he's dead, man. - [Asif] Murdoch's looking for payback. And he's already making mistakes. That's when we check him. - What makes you think that he's not watching us right now as we speak? Huh? That he didn't already think about this? - He'd have called out brother Nazim already. They're gonna settle the score tonight. - Let them kill each other. I don't give a fuck. - Nah. Gonna make 'em work for it. I done slashed his tires. Put a hit out on him. his own man's gonna do him. - I thought we were the good cops. - Nah, right now we're terrorists. Until we right this wrong. (anxious music) - As the days go by, my prayers have been consumed with visions of my own death. Now back in prison, I was always taught to keep a razor in my mouth, just in case my life was threatened I, for one, do not see confrontation And denounce what I believe to be what is wrong. (unsettling music) But my natural instinct is to survive. And I do not know if I have the strength to deny myself the gift of life. (thumping) (dog barking) (laughing) (grunting) (coughing) - Is that all you got? That was weak, son. (laughing) - Look, Alistair, all I need you to do is sign this piece of paper, and we can end this once and for all, okay? (spits) Sign the paper, Alistair. You killed him, didn't you? You killed the old man. - Oh yeah. That's what you want to hear, isn't it? - It's all right. You can admit it. You don't have to lie about it. I'm your little brother. You can tell me anything. - Tell you what. - You can whisper it in my ear. Just whisper it in my ear. - I fucking killed him. What the... - Uh-oh. (laughing) (chuckles) Whoopsie! (laughing) I don't know how that got there. Uh-oh. (laughing) I swear, I don't. Don't you fucking! (shouts) Don't! Don't, don't, don't, don't! Please, please! I'll sight it! I'll sign it! I will sign it. I'll fucking sign it. Don't you fucking dare! (yells) Don't you fucking touch him! (dog barking) Don't you fucking! It's me you want. It's me you want. You want the paper? I'll sign the paper. It's all right! I'll sign the fucking paper. Bring it here. Is that what you want? If you fucking hurt Smooch, I'll... (yelling) Okay. Are you happy now? Tell him to back away! Tell him to back away. Call that piece of shit off. Don't you fucking touch him! (dog barking) Don't you fucking touch him! No! (gun pops) (dog whimpering) (emotional music) (siren wailing) (chatter on radio) Where am I? What's going on? - Just relax, brother. Rest, brother. - Smooch. Where's Smooch? Please tell me he's alive, man. Please. - Alistair, man, I'm truly sorry for your loss, man. (whimpering) He's fucking dead, man. - I'm sorry. - Fucking gone, man. Where the fuck was he with Smooch, huh? Why the fuck was he with Smooch? - We in danger right now, bro. And if we don't do something about this, your dog is not gonna be the only one that dies. Brother, I learned two things upstate, man. The difference between a cop and a crook. Your boy, Farouk, is a cop. Believe that, man. - What the fuck are you talking about? - We're caught up in a trap right now! And the head of police wants my head on the block! - You're a fucking liar! Go to hell! Go to hell! I don't want to fucking be here! Let me out! Get me out! (overlapping shouts) (tense music) - Well... It's done, Bianca. You have the family trust. - Douglas, don't be rude. Come sit down. - Of course. I've resigned my post. That's effective immediately. And I've given my letter... to the executive committee. - Well, as much as it pains me to see you go, I must thank you for your many years of loyal service. I want you to know it hasn't gone unnoticed. - Oh. My, my, my. (laughing) (anxious music) You know... I know what you're doing, Bianca. Well if anybody else ever, ever finds out... (laughing) I know that we will both... both rot in hell. (laughing) (groans) (laughing) Fuck you. (thuds) (sharp string music) (overlapping speech) - On several occasions, I tried to notify the police department that there were outside criminals trying to conduct acts of terror underneath the guise of our mosque. I'm now convinced that these bad apples are in fact working undercover for the NYPD. (overlapping speech) Furthermore, this entrapment has been conducted under the direct supervision of the police commissioner and one Frank Murdoch on the county terrorism unit. Now, I have reason to believe, personal and official, that this individual is now threatening my life. But believe me, I'm not afraid to die, especially for what I believe to be the truth. This is America, and in this country, you, me, everyone out here has the right to worship or pray to any God they choose to. Now, unless the constitution has changed, we have the human right to be treated equal and innocent until proven guilty, if nothing else. So I ask all of you watching at home, if you see injustice, at least stand up and call it for what it is. Unjust. That's all I have to say. I ain't got nothing else to say. (overlapping speech) God bless America. God bless America. (speaks foreign language) I'm good. (frenetic string music) (train rumbling) - Smooch is gone, man. He's dead. Guess there ain't much I can do now, huh? Then, maybe I should uh, file a police report. Ain't that right... Officer? - It wasn't supposed to go down like this. - What's your name? Your real name. - It's Jimmy. Jimmy Colon. - I kinda like Farouk better. Where are you going? - To do what I gotta do. What I signed up to do. (voice quavering) (stark bass music) - Where you going? - I think I'm going to pay the old man a visit. I haven't seen him in a while. In fact, I think I'm gonna get the whole gang back together. Yeah. That's what I'm gonna do. (anxious music) - Slow down. Don't get too close. I'd like to thank you, sir. You and your people. You gave me a chance to defend this great experiment called America. And a chance to face down our foreign animals. Like yourself. That means we're living. That means we're not sitting on the sidelines like some god damn pussies. Because of what you're doing right now... you won't be sitting on some shrink's couch when you're 45 years old, saying, "What the fuck did I do with my life?" (gun clicking) Why? Someone like you and me... we serve others. We serve a higher purpose. (anxious music) You know something? I would gladly storm the gates of hell in company of men like you. We show people that free people can still fight like hell. Stop. Pull over. (singing in foreign language) - Yo, Murdoch... (guns banging) (thudding) I always knew you was a fucking pig! (gun bangs) (singing in foreign language) (cheering) - No, it's fine. Like- Let him be. (clears throat) (glass clinking) (chuckles) I'd like to make a toast, everyone, to my dear brother, Alistair. He's been sick and... I just want to welcome him back home with the family. So, cheers, everyone. (applauding) (calm music) May I have this dance? - Love is love. (crying) (moving music) - [Nazim] Yo, Cito Caban. Tell the guards we're leaving the yard now. Got the wind on my back. Sun on my face. I'm walking with you now. (peaceful music) (bouncy bass music) (ethereal vocal music)
