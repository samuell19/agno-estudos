Ripped, corrected and synched by Fingersmaster. Enjoy! FRIEND Blacksta. Blacksta. - What's up, Kena? - I'm good We good? So, I'll see you later, beautiful? - But we're not done yet. - Don't worry. Later. At least buy her dinner. No way. Her mother runs a kiosk. It would be an insult to take her out elsewhere. Take this. At least buy her some chips. Cool. Whatever. - How many cards? - Four each. Don't bet all your money. Let's start. Blacky, I can see you are coming! - Are you going to Stevo's tomorrow? - I don't think so. I win. Forget Stevo. There's a new barber called Maina. Look how he hooked me up. What's wrong? The cut starts here. You look like Uncle Njugush. I thought you said your girlfriend was at home. Yeah. She's with your sister, cooking for me. Stop being stupid. What are you looking at, faggot? How is he hurting you? Do you think God is just watching men fuck each other? I don't want to play anymore. Do you want a real drink? I have to go. I'm working tomorrow. No worries. You'll make a good wife. That's why I like you. Later. It's fine, Mrs. Machoko. Pay me next time. John, you have my vote. I know. Your vote is more important than two bags of flour and soap. You are welcome. Kena. Can I talk to you? Can we talk later? Okay. How's Mum doing? The same. Dad, I need to go. - I'll be back later. - Okay. I saw Mr. Otieno coming out of block C-E at twelve o'clock in the afternoon. From Mrs. Kamau's? At twelve o'clock in the afternoon? That woman is strong, handling two men at the same time. I forgot to tell you. Congratulations. For what? You don't know? The woman your father just married is pregnant. Don't you know? He didn't tell you? Don't you speak to each other? Go tell your mum that her ex-husband is expecting a baby boy! Bring the food. Kena. Don't forget to tell her. And we shall not bring upon the afflictions of Egypt. We ask for your restoration. We ask for your healing today, Sheila. Yeah, I know this is difficult. I know it is. Pray to Jehovah-Rapha. Jehovah-Rapha is our healer. Pray to Jehovah-Rapha. Hey, Kena I was waiting and waiting. So hungry. What's wrong? Nothing. How was your day? The usual. I go there, I work, I teach. No one listens. Those classes are getting so crowded now. What's wrong, Kena? Mama Atim. She seems to have something to say about everyone and everything. Yeah, she's a gossip, but she doesn't lie. Did your father ask about me today? No, he didn't. He must be busy with the campaign. Dad. Why didn't you tell me? I tried. I wanted to tell you. I tried to tell you. I was worried about your mum and you. Kena, this will be your baby brother. I want him to know his big sister. Why don't you take the day off? We can talk about it tomorrow together. Think about it. Maybe go hang out with your friends. But think about it. Maybe you can share it with your mum. Kena. - Hey, Kena. - What's up, Blacksta? It's over there. Get off and walk. You said it's door-to-door service. How many doors have we passed to get here? Door-to-door? What's up? Blacksta. Okemi's daughter? You know her father's running against mine? Stop that. Where are you going? I'm going home. I'll give you a ride. - Then hurry. - I'll drive fast. Ziki. Hey! Hey! Oh, my God! She's coming! Ziki, she's going to kill you! Ziki! Guys. Ziki, run! Before we start our sermon, I would like to welcome our guests. Our special guests, Assemblyman Okemi-- ...his wife, and his daughter. I would like to start the service by talking about generosity of heart. We don't have a shortage of generous people. We have a businessman here, Mr. John Mwaura. A person who shares his wealth with people that don't have enough, and he gives with a generous heart. Mr. Okemi, you'll agree with me. If you help others find relief... Mum, we should go. What's going on there? It might be a new baby. Mum, it's so hot. Mercy. When is it due? When is it due? He's due in February. Can't you even answer me? You're man enough to have a son and you can't even answer me. Come on, let's go. - Congratulations, John. - Congratulations. You're sweet. So, I have to go and apologize. To who? You guys pulled down her dad's posters. - Really? That's where you're going? - Ziki! Hi. Hi. So... Do you want to do something? We could go get a soda? A soda? Cool. Mama Atim's, eh? So? Want some food? Do you want something to eat? I don't think so. We're okay, thanks. This is where you hang out? Yeah. I usually hang out here with Blacksta and the other guys. So like, usually right in here and... Both politicians' daughters? Here at Mama Atim's? Today, the sun will rain! Wonders of the world. Do you think their fathers know? It's not my job to tell them. Would you like to get out of here? Look! They're leaving. They haven't finished their sodas. It's cool, yeah? Yeah, it's nice. Kena. - You good? - Yeah. Tell me something about you. I'm waiting for my marks. Then after that, there's a nursing school I'm hoping for. You want to be a nurse? Yes. Like, why a nurse? You can be anything else. Like a doctor. You can be a surgeon. People need nurses. People need a lot of things. So, university? I don't know. I want to travel first. I want to see the world and to go to all those places where they've probably never seen an African and just show up there and be like, "Yo, I'm here and I'm a Kenyan from Africa." But you're not the typical Kenyan girl-- - I know. - ...that they'd be looking for. Well, I don't know. My parents don't think the same way. I don't want to be like them. Just staying at home and doing typical Kenyan stuff-- doing the laundry, having babies. Making chapati. No one likes making chapati. Let's make a pact... that we will never be like any of them down there. Instead... we're gonna be... Something. We're gonna be something. Something real? Yes. Something real. So I hear you've been spending time with Okemi's daughter. Yes, I have. Does your father know? I'm sure Mama Atim is just dying to tell him. You should bring her over. I'd like to meet her. Okay. I will. Something's different about you, Kena. Nothing's different. - Is it a boy? - Mum! No. Is it that Blacksta? No. People like the Okemis will lift you up. Everyone else, including that Blacksta, will just be a weight that keeps you stuck right here. Choose wisely, Kena. Let's go! Can we play? Can we play? No. But you let her. Who, Kena? She plays like a guy! Right, Kena? And you girls will distract us. So you guys are afraid we'll beat you. It's okay. Let them play. I'm not about to get sweaty. Don't worry. I'll get you sweaty later. Let's play! Kena! Kena, open! This is nice. I have to go. Stay. Hey. I'll see you later? My name is Makena, a friend of Ziki's. Okay. Is she home? Yes, she's home. I want us to go on a real date. Like real. I've seen how you look at me. You have to try this on. It's perfect. Do you think about me? Sometimes. And what do you think about... me? Your eyes. If we were to do something-- just me and you-- what would we do? We'd go on night drives. We'd definitely stare at the sky. And then what? Come. I had so much fun. We still have paint on our faces. You have to get rid of this when you get home. I'll make some more for your beautiful wife. Oh, thank you. I'm sure she'll be grateful. I'm sorry. I overslept. Kena, you never oversleep. Were you out last night? I was. I was out with some friend. Which friend? Okemi's daughter. - She's nice. - That's not the point. Okemi's daughter. You know... people have spent money in this campaign. I'm spending money in this campaign. But you know what they're gonna tell me, what they're gonna say? Why are we supporting this guy? Yet his own daughter doesn't. You didn't even want this job in the first place. Well, I took it. And now the people are depending on me, and letting them down is not an option, Kena. You're a clever girl. Use your brain! You're a smart one. Peter Okemi! Man of action! Peter Okemi! Man of action! - Dad. - I'm okay. I'm okay. Minor setback, but I'm okay. I'd still vote for you. - Hi. - Hey, love. Good morning. - You know exam results are out? - Yeah. Ziki? Okay, fine. Have you checked? - No. I've been waiting for you. - Okay. Have you-- Have you checked? - Yeah. - Okay. - Do you want to guess what you got? - No, no. Don't-- Okay, tell me. No, don't tell me. Just, like, guess. Guess what you have. A "C." Yeah. - You think you got a "C"? - Yes. Definitely. Okay, like, aim higher. C-plus? You think you got a C-plus? Okay. That's what you got. - That's what you got! - Oh, my gosh. - I get to be a doctor! - Yes. - That's what this means. - That's what that means. - I can get a scholarship. - Yes. And you're the one who wanted to be a nurse. You wanted to be a nurse, like, with these grades. - You think a nurse-- - I can be a doctor. You can be a doctor. Doctor Kena. Ziki! And you? What did you get? Ziki! - Can we talk about it later? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Ziki, come here right now! Is everything okay? - Yes. - Yes. Dad, it doesn't matter. What do you mean it doesn't matter? What doesn't matter? - Hey! - Hi. Dance with me. Kena. Shots! I have a toast! Cheers to Kena for bringing me my future ex-wife. Another toast. To Kena, my number one girl. The smartest nurse in Slopes! Today we drink! Blacky, Blacky. Now he walks even more like a fag. Homo! Your hair looks amazing. What's it called? Why did you leave? Kena. - Is that for me? - Yeah. Wow. - Is that my cupcake? - Yeah. Just try it out. I'm sorry that I came yelling. This is really nice. You're welcome. No. Stay. Stay. I wish this was real. It is. When we go out there... Don't worry. We'll do this again. Come. Let me walk you home. No. I don't want to go home. Would you want to go and fetch water, or would you rather stay here? Hey, Kena. What's up, Blacksta? You've been out all night? Something like that. Who is the guy? Guy? Fine then. One day you will see for yourself. - See what? - The kind of guy I am. I'll give you everything you've ever wanted-- money in your account, a mortgage, title deed. You think that's all I want in life? That's what everybody wants. Let's do this. Let me finish my workout, and I'll come get you. Later. Just a bike ride. It's not a big deal. I'll get my bike and come. - Blacksta. - Nduta, I'm busy. - Why won't you answer me? - What do you say, Kena? Nduta, I am busy. What's the problem? I have to go. You don't have to be mean to me. She's gonna come back. I told you my body's allergic to dresses. Come on, Kena, let's go. Ziki, doesn't she just look like a proper woman? Very sexy. All we need is a nice, rich doctor, and all my prayers will have been answered today. I would like to start the service. Before I start, I would like to thank God for giving me a wife. My wife is beautiful, clever... courageous, and wise. What surprises me is that there are Kenyans who are challenging the government because of their stand... on same-sex marriage. They say it's a human right. What is a human right? Isn't it God who decides what is right and what isn't? Are we going to ignore God? Don't choose to be lost! Because God's laws don't change like human laws or your country's. Let's go to the Word of God and see what it says. "God left them to follow their shameful desires. Even women changed their natural ways... to unnatural ways." Understand? "And men did the same thing. They left women for unnatural ways... and desired other men. They did shameful things with other men. And as a result of their sin, they suffered." I was just having fun. Fun? Is that all you think about? - Kena, what's the problem? - My family's in there. My family's in there also. Everyone was listening to the sermon. Who was watching? No one. No one was paying attention. Is it wrong for me to show you how I feel when I feel? No, it's not. It's not, but you can't do it here. You want to tell me that whole church was watching me and what I was doing? Exactly. - Are you serious right now? - Yes. No one gives a shit! Like, they don't care! When are you ever going to do stuff without thinking of who will see or what they'll say or what's going to happen after? Just be you. This is irresponsible, Ziki. We can do this somewhere else. Kena. Are you okay? Let's go for a ride. Fresh air gets rid of stress. I wish we could go somewhere where we could be real. What do you mean "real"? Don't worry. It's okay. Kena, do me a favor. Can you hold the shop while I'm away? Mama Kamau's child is unwell. I'm taking them to the hospital. Sure. Every vote counts. Hey! Stay away from Ziki! Are you a fucking lesbian or something? I see the way you look at her, and it's sick. Whatever it is that you're trying, you'll not get away with it. Look at you. You're nothing. Stay away from me! Kena! Leave me alone! Bitch! Get away from me! Kena, get off of her! Yeah, I told you she's crazy. What's your problem! How can you choose her over me? Let me go! Just let them go! - How can you do this to me? - Elizabeth, just stop it! Careful. What? I love you. So then how come you don't tell me? Careful, Ziki. I've not even touched you. Does that make it any better? Kena, get out. Mum. She was just-- This is the reason why you and Elizabeth fought. I was-- She was bleeding. I've just been on the phone to her mother. Mum, Elizabeth was calling her names. Names? What do you think I am? What do you take me for-- stupid? Naive? Blind? I have seen it all, Ziki. Mum... You know, I've had enough. I'm calling her mother now. Mum, please don't. - Please. - Mum, don't. I've had enough. It's finished. - Please, Mrs. Okemi. - Kena, no, I've had enough! Mum, please don't. Mum, please don't! Ziki! Ziki! Come, come, come. Ziki! Kena, let's go. - Get in. - Thanks. - We locked her in. - I know. What are you going to do? We could have our own place, just me and you. You got really good grades in your exams, so you're going to be a doctor. And I can get a job. Plus, like, I'll cook for you chapati. Every time. Yes? What are you doing? - What do you want? - Do your parents know? Like you can't mind your own business? I told you, Mum. What the fuck does she want? Come! They're here! I found them! The politicians' daughters stuck together like dogs! Come! Come! Get them out. Ziki! Ziki! Ziki! Waireri! Hey! Between the two of you... which one of you is the man? We want it for our records, eh? Ziki. - Where is the police chief's office? - This way. And you! Stay away from my family! Get in the car! Ziki. - Haven't you hurt her enough already? - Get in the car! Your mother already knows. Will you come in? Okay. Go. Clean up. How will it help? Let her clean up. We can talk after that. She will never be clean. Why don't you save that anger for those guys who almost beat her to death? They should be at the police station, not our daughter. - So you're fine with this? - It's not that easy. You know everything about easy. Don't you? Don't make this about me, Mercy. It is always about you. You are the shopkeeper! You are the MCA! What am I? A single mother alone who always gets blamed for everything. They will probably blame me for this just like they blamed me when you left me! Mercy, I don't think it was anyone's fault that this happened. It is her fault! It is your fault! - Mum. - Don't you dare! - I'm sorry. - Don't you dare speak to me! It is your fault, John. Kena. Are you forgetting that demons have possessed this child? You want me to accept these demons in this house? - Are you suggesting-- - I am concentrating on cleansing her. She is full of demons, and it is because of you-- you and those women out there. It is all your fault! Blacksta. Kena? We're humbled, and our hearts are broken. We pray to you, merciful God... to save this soul. We praise your name. You are all-powerful. Show mercy on Kena. Let your blessing descend upon her. Let your grace be manifested. Show us your power. Oh, God, be God. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, gracious God. Thank you, gracious God! We take action in your name. We say every strong hold is broken. Mum? Dad. I think we should close early today. I'm not seeing any customers coming our way. You're losing because of me. It could have been worse. You could have gone to jail. I'll tell them it's my fault. You had nothing to do with it. I want to be an MCA, but, Kena, there are some things I can never do. Hi, Kena. Let's go for a ride. Just a short ride. Maybe later. Why? I love that girl. Why do you like hurting the people that care about you? I'm the one who's here. Me! It's okay. Don't worry Blacksta. Can I see her? Are you going? They're sending me to London. But you can stay here. Get to travel. Like what I always wanted. It's exactly what I wanted. That's what you always wanted? Yeah. Ziki. Kena, stop being naive. What did you expect was going to happen either way? Were you planning to marry me? Are we going to have this beautiful family? Yes. I want my normal life back. - Ziki-- - Kena, just stop it. How am I stopping you? Of course. You're just a typical Kenyan girl. Kena, get out! Please, just leave! Just go. Don't let me go. Please, Mummy, can I stay? Mum, please let me stay. Please give me your hand. Is this where you came to hide? Leave me alone. You will not touch me! If you need help, just turn and press the bell. Just get out. Do you know she's back? Ziki Okemi. Ziki Okemi is back in Slopes. Did you hear me? She's back in Slopes. What's up? I'm cool. Mum? Kena. -- English --
