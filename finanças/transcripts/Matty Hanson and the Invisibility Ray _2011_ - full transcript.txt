[♪♪♪] THERE'S THOSE BIRDS AGAIN. CAN'T FIGURE WHY THEY DO THAT. SHOO! SHOO! WELL, GENTLEMEN, THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SECURITY BREACHES SOMEPLACE ELSE OR EVEN EVERYPLACE ELSE, BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THERE HAVE BEEN NO SUCH BREACHES HERE. PROTECTING CLASSIFIED DATA IS OUR PARAMOUNT CONCERN. THAT BEING SAID, WHEN WASHINGTON CALLS, WE ANSWER, AND, THEREFORE, YOU WILL HAVE OUR FULLEST COOPERATION. [chuckles] [knocks on door] EXCUSE THE INTERRUPTION, DR. HANSON. NOT NOW, I'LL MESS UP! OH, OF COURSE. I'M SORRY... [clears throat] LET US GO THIS WAY. MIDTOWN PARK. HURRY. KEEP GOING. WOW, WHERE'D YOU GET THAT? MADE IT. GIVE YOU 50 BUCKS FOR IT. NOT NOW, I'LL MESS UP! FLYBOY53? YOU'RE WANDERINAL? IS SOMETHING WRONG? FROM YOUR SCREEN NAME, I WAS EXPECTING A GUY. SORRY. NO, I DIDN'T-- BEING A GIRL'S OKAY. I MEAN, IT'S AWESOME THAT YOU'RE... THE "AL" PART'S FOR "ALICE." THE "WANDERING" PART IS 'CAUSE WE MOVE A LOT. I'M MATT. SO, 3DFAN SAID YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT MY DAD'S CAR CRASH. I SAW THAT THEY HAD A MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR HIM AT THE UNIVERSITY. SOUNDED LIKE SOME KIND OF GENIUS. YEAH, HE KNEW EVERYTHING. WHAT ABOUT THE ACCIDENT? MY FATHER AND I DROVE BY RIGHT AFTER IT HAPPENED. HE'S THE ONE THAT CALLED 911. YOU SAW THE CRASH? NO, BUT RIGHT BEFORE IT, YOUR FATHER'S CAR PASSED US GOING REALLY FAST. ANOTHER CAR WAS RIGHT BEHIND HIM. CHASING MY DAD? THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL THE POLICE? MY FATHER DIDN'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED. HE WOULDN'T EVEN USE HIS CELL PHONE TO CALL 9-1-1. HE FOUND A PAY PHONE. I'M SORRY. WE SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE. (WOMAN) SOMETHING MUST BE DONE. I CAN NO LONGER TOLERATE HIS CHILDISH PRANKS. MATT IS A CHILD. YOU SEEM TO BE FORGETTING THAT. AND HE SEEMS TO BE FORGETTING THAT THIS IS A WORLD-RENOWNED RESEARCH INSTITUTE. AMFORD INSTITUTE HAS MORE-- NOBEL LAUREATES IN RESIDENCE THAN HARVARD. YES, THAT'S TRUE, AND THEY WILL ALL HAVE EGG ON THEIR FACES IF MATT DOES NOT JUST BUCKLE DOWN. THE REVIEW CONFERENCE ON THE INVISIBILITY PROJECT IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER. IT'S TIME THAT MATT PUT HIS SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL, HIS NOSE TO THE GRINDSTONE. CHILDREN'S NOSES DON'T BELONG ON THE GRINDSTONE, AND YOU CAN'T EXPECT HIM TO CONCENTRATE ON HIS WORK. NOT SO SOON AFTER HE LOST HIS FATHER. OF COURSE, OF COURSE. I KNOW THAT WAS A TERRIBLE SHOCK. MATTHEW'S FATHER WAS A GREAT SCIENTIST, AND MORE, A GREAT MAN, BUT, SOMETIMES, HARD WORK CAN BE THE BEST MEDICINE. I THINK THAT IF MATT WOULD BUCKLE DOWN, IT WOULD HELP HIM TO TAKE HIS MIND OFF HIS GRIEF. I'M ONLY THINKING OF HIM. OF COURSE. WE DISCUSSED THIS BEFORE, WHAT ABOUT A COMPANION FOR MATTHEW? SOMEONE TO HELP HIM STAY ON TASK. NO. I AM TRYING TO KEEP HIS LIFE AS NORMAL AS POSSIBLE. NOW, HOW CAN I DO THAT IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE CONSTANTLY FOLLOW HIM? I KNOW. I SYMPATHIZE COMPLETELY. IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TO BE THE PARENT OF AN EXTRAORDINARY GENIUS, AND YOUR LATE HUSBAND AGREED WITH YOUR VIEWS, BUT HE FELT THAT MATT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE CHALLENGES THE INSTITUTE COULD PROVIDE FOR GROWTH. I WOULD HATE TO SEE HIM WASTE THAT OPPORTUNITY. I'LL TALK TO HIM. THANK YOU. [dog barks] (MATT'S MOTHER) YOU'RE NOT A PRISONER, MATT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SNEAK OUT. IT WAS AN EXPERIMENT, MOM. I WAS TESTING AN INTERACTIVE HOLOGRAM I BUILT. WAIT A MINUTE, YOU BUILT A HOLOGRAM TO FOOL DR. HAAS? YEAH, IT EVEN TALKS. I STILL GOT A COUPLE BUGS IN THE PROGRAM, OR SHE NEVER WOULD'VE CAUGHT ME. OKAY, SO, WHERE DID YOU GO WHILE YOU WERE OUT? JUST AROUND, YOU KNOW. NO, YOU'RE BEING EVASIVE, MATTHEW. HOW COME YOU ONLY CALL ME MATTHEW WHEN YOU'RE MAD? I'M NOT MAD, HONEY. I'M PROUD OF YOU, BUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE INSTITUTE, YOU CAN QUIT. THAT WAS OUR DEAL. I JUST WANT YOU TO DO WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY. IT'S OKAY, I MEAN... WITH DAD, IT WAS FUN. NOW IT'S MORE LIKE WORK. YOU THINK IT'S TOO MUCH WORK? NO. SOME OF THE PROJECTS ARE PRETTY COOL. YOU KNOW, YOUR DAD WOULD UNDERSTAND IF YOU WANTED TO STOP. HE TOLD ME SO RIGHT BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. MAYBE IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT. OH, PLEASE. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, MOM. JUST LISTEN-- HONEY, I HAVE LISTENED. I HAVE. IT'S JUST THAT SOMETIMES TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN FOR NO REASON, AND THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. NOW, YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR MIND OFF IT. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU. I'LL BE UPSTAIRS. NO, WAIT A MINUTE. THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. I WAS THINKING THAT... MAYBE WE COULD USE A LITTLE HELP AROUND HERE. LIKE CLEANING AND STUFF? NO, FOR YOU. I MEAN, IT'S NOT FAIR FOR YOU TO BE SITTING HERE WHILE I'M TEACHING. SO, I THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD HIRE A GUY, SORT OF LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, LIKE A BIG BROTHER, WHO COULD DRIVE YOU PLACES AND DO STUFF WITH YOU THAT YOU LIKE TO DO. AND SPY ON ME FOR DR. HAAS? NO, HE WON'T. HAAS WANTS SOMEONE WATCHING ME SO I'LL WORK MORE. THAT'S ALL SHE CARES ABOUT. WELL, I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN. I DON'T NEED ANYBODY. EDISON. WHAT NOW? PULL UP THE POLICE REPORT ON THE CRASH. THE POLICE REPORT? I'LL GET IT FOR YOU RIGHT AWAY. YOU HAD NO BUSINESS DOING THAT. DAD, IT'S HIS FATHER. HE HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW. WHAT ELSE DID YOU TELL HIM? I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE FREAKIN' OUT. I'M ASKING YOU A QUESTION. NOTHING. I SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED, THAT'S ALL. DOES HE KNOW YOUR NAME? WHICH ONE? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? SHE USES A PRETEND NAME ON THE COMPUTER. ALL THE KIDS DO. OKAY, YOU'RE NOT TO SEE HIM AGAIN. IS THAT CLEAR? WHATEVER. ALICE! [MOTHER] I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN SOMEDAY. [FATHER] OKAY, CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN. JUST WHEN I THOUGHT WE WERE FINALLY SAFE. IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. YEAH? AND WHAT IF THAT BOY TELLS THE POLICE? WHAT THEN, SCOTT? I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY. WE COULDN'T LEAVE THE COUNTRY. THEY'LL NEVER STOP LOOKING FOR US. OKAY, LISTEN, WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE, WE'LL GET THROUGH IT AGAIN. WE JUST HAVE TO BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL. AND WHAT IF SOMEBODY RECOGNIZES THAT PICTURE OF SARAH? YOU CAN'T CALL ALICE THAT. NEVER USE THAT NAME. WHAT DID THEY FIND IN THE CAR, EDISON? IS THERE A LIST? THAT WOULD BE CALLED "AN INVENTORY." I'LL CHECK. HERE IT IS. PRINT IT OUT. CALL COMING IN. WANDRINGAL IS TRYING TO REACH YOU ON VIDEOCHAT. CONNECT HER. HER? NOW, EDISON. OH, MATT, MY PARENTS ARE FREAKIN' ME OUT. WHAT HAPPENED? I CAN'T TALK, THEY'RE SPYING ON ME, BUT I HEARD THEM SAYING THE WEIRDEST STUFF. ALICE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? [lawnmower starts] [sentimental music] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? STUFF'S MISSING. THE INVENTORY SAYS THERE WERE THREE DISKS. YOU SHOULDN'T BE DISTURBING THIS. WHERE ARE THEY? THEY BELONG TO THE INSTITUTE, SO I RETURNED THEM. WE NEVER TOOK STUFF FROM THE INSTITUTE, IT'S AGAINST THE RULES. SWEETIE, LET IT GO. YOU'RE GETTING OBSESSED. IT WORRIES ME. CAN I KEEP THIS? OF COURSE YOU CAN. EDISON, HAVE YOU SEEN IT YET? IT SEEMS TO HAVE VANISHED. CARS DON'T JUST DISAPPEAR, EDISON. FIND IT. THE TOWING COMPANY DOESN'T HAVE COMPUTERIZED FILES. I'LL SEARCH POLICE RECORDS. [knocking] WHAT? I GOT A WORD, MATT. IS IT OKAY? YEAH, BARNEY. PUT IT UP. YOUR TURN. [quirky music] DID I WIN? DID I WIN? FOUND IT. WHERE WAS IT? IN THE POSSESSION OF THE FBI. WHOA. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MATT? LOOKING FOR A CAR. YOU SHOULD GET A NEW ONE. THAT ONE'S BROKEN. ARE YOU BEING A NUISANCE AGAIN? NO, DR. HAAS. AH... WE'RE EXPLORING OPTICAL DIFFUSION, ARE WE? YES, WE ARE. WELL, I HOPE IT PRODUCES RESULTS BEFORE THE CONTRACT REVIEW CONFERENCE. SO FAR, THE ONLY THING INVISIBLE ABOUT THE INVISIBILITY PROJECT... IS PROGRESS. WELL, IT IS TIME TO INTERVIEW THE APPLICANTS TO BE YOUR AIDE-DE-CAMP. IS THAT FRENCH FOR "SPY"? I THINK THEY'RE ALL EXCELLENT CANDIDATES. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG. A NATIVE OF VULTURE'S GULCH, NEVADA, AND RETIRED AFTER 25 YEARS IN THE MARINE CORPS, HE BELIEVES IN "TOTAL AUTHORITY", AND USES TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED AT BOOT CAMP "TO GET THINGS DONE." SOUNDS PERFECT TO ME. [BUZZER SOUNDS] ...IS HIGHLY EXPERIENCED WITH CHILDREN, AND EVERY AFTERNOON, SHE SERVES GOOD LITTLE BOYS A VERY SPECIAL TREAT. SOMETIMES, IT'S COOKIES, SOMETIMES, IT'S CAKE, WHATEVER IT IS, SHE LOVES TO BAKE. OH, I SEE, THAT RHYMES. DELIGHTFUL. [BUZZER SOUNDS] AND FINALLY, MY OWN PERSONAL FAVORITE, A YOUNG MAN WHO COMBINES TREMENDOUS SENSITIVITY FOR FINER THINGS WITH A WELL-TUNED SENSE OF ADVENTURE AND FUN. NOW, MATTHEW, I THINK THAT THIS BOY WOULD BE A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE FOR YOU, AND I THINK THAT YOU... [buzzer sounds] I HATED THEM ALL. THEN WE'LL KEEP LOOKING UNTIL WE FIND SOMEONE THAT YOU LIKE. I WON'T LIKE ANY OF THEM. OH, IT'LL WORK OUT, SWEETIE. JUST GIVE IT A FAIR TRY. [sighs] ANY MESSAGES, EDISON? THE CAR HAS BEEN RELEASED TO SALVAGE. EMERGENCY! YOU HAVE A VIDEO DISTRESS CALL FROM ALICE. RUN IT. MATT, I'VE GOT TO SEE YOU. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE IT. I THINK I WAS KIDNAPPED WHEN I WAS LITTLE. WHAT? ...AND THEN I HEARD MY PARENTS ARGUING. MOM SOUNDED REALLY SCARED. SHE KEPT SAYING STUFF ABOUT HOW IT WAS OVER, HOW THEY'RE LOOKING FOR US. WHO? I DON'T KNOW, BUT THE WEIRD THING WAS SHE CALLED ME SARAH. MY DAD GOT MAD. HE SAID NEVER TO CALL ME THAT. EVER. IT WAS FREAKY. I BET. THEN I FOUND THIS. THAT LOOKS LIKE ME. SHE WAS KIDNAPPED 10 YEARS AGO. IT'S HARD TO TELL. WHAT IF THEY'RE NOT MY REAL PARENTS? I'LL FIND OUT, I PROMISE. [television] HI, FOLKS. SYD SIMONS, STANDARD SECURITY AND SPA. WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT SOUND MEANS, TROUBLE, AND NOBODY WANTS TROUBLE AT HOME. EASY TO INSTALL, THE SHIELD BARRIER DOOR KEEPS TROUBLE OUTSIDE... WHERE IT BELONGS. JUST ASK PRO RUNNING BACK CUTTER HANSON. WOW, I COULD BEAT THE LEAGUE'S TOUGHEST DEFENSES, BUT THE SHIELD'S SO TOUGH, IT EVEN BEATS ME. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK, HUH? WHAT AN ANIMAL! THIS GUY'S AN ANIMAL OR WHAT? I LOVE THIS GUY. TELL YOU WHAT, MANNY, YOU PUT THE SHIELD IN EVERY HOUSE IN YOUR NEW DEVELOPMENT, AND CUTTER'LL PROMOTE IT PERSONALLY. RIGHT, CUTTER? YEAH. YEAH, LET'S PUT THIS DEAL TO BED. ALL RIGHT. THIS FIRST. COME ON, LET'S GO. GIVE ME A BREAK, SYD. GO AHEAD, CUTTER, JUST DON'T HURT THE HAND THAT HE SIGNS WITH. IT'S ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD. COME ON, BABY. SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT. ALL RIGHT. SO WHAT'D YOU PLAY, 10 SEASONS? UH, NINE. OH, NINE. NEVER MADE IT TO THE SUPERBOWL, HUH? AH, IT'S JUST ANOTHER GAME. MAN, THAT'S GOT TO EAT YOU. I MEAN, YOU PLAYED ON WHAT, THREE, FOUR TEAMS AND NEVER MADE IT TO THE SUPERBOWL? YOU'RE JUST A WALKING ENCYCLOPEDIA, HUH? YOU NEVER MADE IT PAST THE PLAYOFFS. I DON'T LOSE MUCH SLEEP OVER IT. OH, I WOULD. I MEAN, LOSING'S FOR LOSERS, RIGHT? [slam on table] AH! MANNY! MANNY, HANG ON A SEC. PLEASE, JUST... LOOK, GIVE ME... MANNY! YOU JUST BLEW OFF THE BIGGEST HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN THE COUNTY! HE WAS ASKING FOR THAT. I HIRE YOU TO ATTRACT CLIENTS, NOT TO ASSAULT THEM. YOU'RE PULLING THE SAME STUFF THAT YOU PULLED ON THE FIELD. MY WHOLE CAREER WAS ONE SPORTS BAR TOUGH GUY AFTER ANOTHER TRYING TO PROVE HOW BAD THEY WERE. I HUNG THAT UP. YOU CAN'T, OKAY. BECAUSE THAT'S WHO YOU ARE. I'M JUST SICK OF IT. THEN I GOT NOTHING FOR YOU. YOU CUTTING ME OUT? COACHES CUT, BOSSES FIRE. [cell phone rings] HI. SORRY. I'M LOOKING FOR THE INSTITUTE? GREAT. THANK YOU. HE SMELLED FUNNY. OH, THAT'S IT, I'VE HAD IT! I'M GOING TO CHOOSE THE PERSON. YOU PROMISED THAT MATT WOULD DECIDE. HE'S NOT EVEN TRYING! MATT! MATT? ELLEN? UNCLE CUTTER! HEY, HEY. I'LL EXPLAIN LATER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I WANT UNCLE CUTTER. ABSOLUTELY NOT. THE MAN HAS NO EXPERIENCE. YOU SAID IT'S MY PICK, AND I PICK HIM. ELLEN... WOULD YOU PLEASE REASON WITH YOUR OFFSPRING? MATT, I DON'T THINK CUTTER'S ALL THAT INTERESTED. IN FACT, I THINK HE'S JUST BEING POLITE. JUST LET ME ASK HIM, MOM. PLEASE. ANGELINA, I DON'T REALLY SEE ANY HARM IN SEEING IF CUTTER CAN HELP OUT AT LEAST UNTIL WE FIND SOMEONE MORE PERMANENT. WHAT IS THIS? YOU FOUND A PROOF FOR PARVAK'S THEOREM? MAYBE. NO, NO, NO, NO! DO I GET CUTTER? GOING... GOING... GOING... ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, YOU WIN, BUT IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY. (CUTTER) YOUR TEXT SAID LIFE AND DEATH, MATT. I DON'T LIKE BEING HUSTLED. WOULD YOU COME IF I HADN'T? NO! I'M ONLY THERE FOR THE IMPORTANT STUFF. THIS IS IMPORTANT. OH, YEAH, I'VE GOT BUSINESS OBLIGATIONS TO ATTEND TO. PLEASE, CUTTER, JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE. IF YOU DON'T, THEY'RE GOING TO PUT ME WITH SOMEONE TERRIBLE. I'M SORRY I LIED. PLEASE? GUESS I COULD SPARE A COUPLE DAYS. EDISON. YES, MATTHEW? WE'VE GOT TO GET MY DAD'S CAR BACK. NO PROBLEM. I'LL HAVE IT DELIVERED TOMORROW. NICE HOUSE. OH, THANKS. THE UNIVERSITY RENTED IT FOR US WHEN WE FIRST MOVED HERE, BUT I WASN'T SURE HOW I WAS GOING TO DO ON THE ENGLISH FACULTY, AND TERRY WANTED TO SEE HOW THINGS WENT AT THE INSTITUTE, SO... WOW. THAT'S SMART. IT'S REALLY NICE OF YOU TO HELP MATT. I'M SURE YOU'VE GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO. HE'S A GREAT KID, AND I'VE... BEEN MEANING TO VISIT MORE SINCE... YEAH. I'M WORRIED THAT HE'S HAVING TROUBLE ADJUSTING. I MEAN, AT FIRST, HE WOULDN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. NOW HE'S HAVING FANTASIES THAT THE CRASH WASN'T AN ACCIDENT. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. [loud guitar music blarring] OH... I... IS THAT MATT? YEAH. HE'S TERRIBLE. IT'S KIND OF NICE TO KNOW HE'S NOT BRILLIANT AT EVERYTHING. SO, THEY HIRED YOU TO THINK? YEP. ABOUT WHAT? ALL KINDS OF STUFF. SUPERCONDUCTORS, FUSION... RIGHT NOW I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THINGS INVISIBLE. AND THEY PAY YOU? YEAH, BUT MOM PUTS IT ALL IN A TRUST FUND. (CUTTER) OH, SWEET. I CAN'T CONCENTRATE WITH YOU WATCHING. NO PROBLEM. HEY, MATT. YOUR DAD USED TO READ THIS TO ME WHEN WE WERE... WHEN WE WERE... KIDS. (MECHANIC) I'M SORRY, BUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO. GUNTHER SAID THE PARTS SHOULD BE HERE ANY DAY NOW. YES, MA'AM, PUT EVERY THING ELSE ASIDE. WON'T TOUCH ANYTHING BUT YOUR CAR. YES, MA'AM. I'M LOOKING NOW. NO, MA'AM. THANK YOU, DR. HAAS. [sighs] HEY, KID. YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS CAR? YES. WE'RE STUDYING THE DEGRADING EFFECTS OF HIGH-IMPACT STRESS ON SUB-ATOMIC BONDING COEFFICIENTS. I'M A FELLOW AT THE INSTITUTE. RIGHT, AND I'M MICK JAGGER. I'M GOING TO NEED YOU TO SIGN THE STORAGE VOUCHER. WOW. SOMEBODY WENT THROUGH THIS WITH A FINE-TOOTH COMB. WHAT WERE THEY LOOKING FOR? CUTTER. ELLEN. HEY. SO, HOW'S IT GOING WITH MATT? OH, YOU KNOW, LIKE, YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. YEAH? ARE YOU HAVING LUNCH? LUNCH? YEAH. GOOD, I'LL JOIN YOU. BUT NOT HERE. WE'RE NOT EATING HERE. MATT'S WORKING SO I GOT TAKE-OUT. THEN THEY FORGOT THE MUSTARD, SO I GOT TO GET HIM THE MUSTARD, YOU KNOW, BEFORE THE HOT DOG GETS COLD. MATTHEW? OH... UNBELIEVABLE... MATT? OH! SO, YOU'VE LOST HIM ALREADY? NO, I DIDN'T LOSE HIM. OH, DID HE TURN HIMSELF INVISIBLE? THAT WOULD BE ENCOURAGING. DOES MATT KNOW YOU SNOOP IN HERE? I'M NOT SNOOPING. NO... HEY, GUYS. WELL, I JUST CAUGHT THE GOOD DOCTOR POKING THROUGH YOUR STUFF. NOT AGAIN. I MOST CERTAINLY WAS NOT POKING-- YOU SHOULD KEEP THE DOOR LOCKED. IT'S GETTING REALLY CUTTHROAT AROUND HERE. ALL RIGHT. I HAVE NOT-- OH... YES! HIGH FIVE! YOU RAN OUT ON ME. I HAD TO, IT WAS IMPORTANT. MY ASSIGNMENT IS TO TAKE CARE YOU AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE SAFE. I TAKE IT VERY, VERY SERIOUSLY. SO... EITHER WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM, OR WE'RE NOT. I'M SORRY, CUTTER. WHY'D YOU SNEAK OFF? IT'S MY GIRLFRIEND. YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND? ALICE. SHE'S GOT A PROBLEM I'M HELPING HER WITH. WELL, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? IT'S KIND OF WEIRD. WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN, I THINK I'VE HEARD IT ALL. AND YOU PROMISE YOU WON'T TELL MOM? YEAH. SO, WHAT HAPPENED THIS AFTERNOON? THIS AFTERNOON? YEAH, THE CHARADE IN THE SNACK BAR? YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHERE MATT WAS. YEAH, I DID. I MEAN, I WAS JUST GETTING HIM LUNCH. HE HATES MUSTARD. HE PUTS KETCHUP ON HIS HOT DOG. SO, MATT AND I GOT OUR SIGNALS CROSSED. NO BIG DEAL. YOU KNOW, TERRY SAID THAT YOU WERE ALLERGIC TO RESPONSIBILITY, AND I THOUGHT THAT HE WAS BEING TOO CRITICAL. MY BROTHER WROTE ME OFF WHEN WE WERE KIDS. I GAVE UP WORRYING ABOUT HIS OPINION A LONG TIME AGO. SURE, YOU DID. ELLEN, I SET THE STATE RECORD FOR RECEPTIONS WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND MY PARENTS CAME TO ONE GAME. 17 SCHOOLS RECRUITED ME, BUT NO ONE CARED 'CAUSE IT'S SPORTS, RIGHT? I'M WAY PAST SWEATING WHAT PEOPLE THINK. OVER SIX MONTHS, NEARLY $10 MILLION, AND NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT. NOT THE FAINTEST GLIMMER OF INSIGHT INTO THE NATURE OF INVISIBILITY. 10 OF DIAMONDS. SIX OF HEARTS. AM I DISTURBING YOUR GAME, DR. HANSON? NOPE. WE HAVE HERE THE MOST POWERFUL ASSEMBLAGE OF PURE INTELLECT SINCE MICHELANGELO AND DA VINCI SPLIT A PIZZA, AND YET, WE HAVE NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT. ACTUALLY, PIZZA WASN'T INVENTED... MATTHEW, PLEASE. IF WE DON'T COME UP WITH SOMETHING PROMISING BEFORE THE REVIEW CONFERENCE, WE WILL LOSE THE CONTRACT. NOW, I WANT ALL OF YOUR IDEAS ON MY DESK BY THE END OF THE DAY. I DON'T CARE HOW CRAZY THEY ARE. WRITE 'EM UP, SEND 'EM IN! (MAN) TRUE BEAUTY CAN NOT BE MADE, ALEXANDER, IT CAN ONLY BE CAPTURED. WE TRACKED IT WITH SIMPLE MILKWEED, AND IF WE'RE LUCKY, WE CAN FREEZE IT FOR A MOMENT TO ADMIRE. [telephone rings] YES? IT'S FOR YOU. YES? THERE WILL BE A PACKAGE FROM THE INSTITUTE AT THE DEAD DROP TONIGHT. I'LL GO MYSELF. IF MY SOURCE IS CORRECT, THIS INFORMATION COULD BE WORTH BILLIONS ON THE BLACK MARKET. INVISIBILITY COULD BE BIGGER THAN MICROCHIPS. (ALICE) ...AND THEN WE MOVED TO SYRACUSE, THAT'S IN NEW YORK. (MATTHEW) WHEN? (ALICE) UH, THANKSGIVING, THIRD GRADE. TRULY GROSS. WE STAYED IN THIS HOTEL, AND THEY SERVED THAT PHONY TURKEY-- (MATTHEW) UH, WHAT SCHOOL DID YOU GO TO? CHERRY ROAD ELEMENTARY. WHAT DO YOU USE ALL THIS STUFF FOR ANYWAY? I'VE PROGRAMMED THE COMPUTER TO RUN A TOTAL SEARCH ON ALICE'S FAMILY IN EVERY STATE. IT'LL PULL UP ALL SORTS OF COOL STUFF. THEN I'LL ACCESS THE FBI DATA BASE. WAS THIS LIKE YOUR SCHOOL SCIENCE PROJECT OR SOMETHING? SOMETHING LIKE THAT. TELL ME WHERE YOUR DAD WORKED. (MATTHEW) I THOUGHT THERE'D BE SOMETHING, I MEAN... IT'S SO BORING. WELL, THAT'S HOW MOST PEOPLE'S LIVES LOOK ON PAPER, RIGHT? IT'S JUST SCHOOL, MARRIAGE, AND WORK. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YOU WERE, LIKE, THIS SUPER GENIUS? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S WEIRD, I GUESS. YEAH, IT'S WEIRD, BUT WEIRD IN A COOL WAY. REALLY? MOST SMART KIDS, THEY'RE ALWAYS SHOWING OFF, BUT YOU'RE NOT LIKE THAT. SO, IF I'D STARTED OFF TALKING ABOUT QUANTUM GRAVITY... THAT WOULD'VE BEEN A GEEK MOVE. OH! SPEAKING OF WEIRD... ALICE'S FATHER, IT SAYS HERE THAT HE USED TO WORK AS THE ASSISTANT MANAGER TO THE ROYAL HOTEL IN ATLANTA UNTIL APRIL OF '99. SO? I USED TO HANG OUT AT THE ROYAL WHEN I WAS IN TOWN PLAYING. IT HAD A GREAT PIANO BAR. I SAY "HAD..." BECAUSE IT BURNT DOWN IN '97. THEY KIDNAPPED ME. THEY MADE UP ALL THIS STUFF TO COVER THE TRAIL. WHOA, WHOA, TIME OUT, OKAY? IT COULD HAVE BEEN A TYPO. WE NEED MORE PROOF. YOU NEED MORE PROOF. IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL FIND OUT. HI. MUSIC TOO LOUD? OH, NO. NO, NO. LISTEN, ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT... NO, I WAS BEING A JERK. NO, I WAS OUT OF LINE. I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID WHAT I SAID. THIS WAS TERRY'S. LOOK AT IT. I FOUND IT WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH HIS PAPERS FOR THE UNIVERSITY. THIS GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO JUNIOR HIGH. MY WHOLE CAREER IS IN HERE. MM-HMM. THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS WITH TERRY, HE TOLD ME THAT HE LOVED ME EXACTLY TWO TIMES. ONCE, WHEN I PROPOSED, AND AGAIN WHEN MATT WAS BORN. I MEAN, THAT MAN COULD TALK ABOUT ANY FORCE IN NATURE EXCEPT FOR HIS OWN FEELINGS. ALL I WANTED WAS TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING. TERRY WAS SO SMART, IT JUST FELT LIKE, YOU KNOW, THERE WASN'T ENOUGH ROOM IN THE FAMILY FOR ANYONE ELSE. OH, YEAH, I BET, BUT HE MADE ROOM FOR MATTHEW. HE KNEW THAT MATT WAS SMARTER THAN HE WAS, AND HE MADE HIM EXCITED TO BE THE WAY HE IS, LIKE LIFE IS ONE BIG ADVENTURE. TELLING MATT WAS THE HARDEST THING THAT I EVER HAD TO DO, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT THAT THINGS COULD GET WORSE, BUT NOW... WHAT HAPPENED? THEY FOUND CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN TERRY'S CAR. I MEAN, REPORTS THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT THE INSTITUTE, AND NOW THERE'S AN INVESTIGATION. THEY THINK HE WAS A SPY? (ELLEN) THEY JUST SAID SOMEONE'S STEALING SECRETS, AND THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING ELSE. I'M SORRY. [grim music] [knocking] HE GIVES ME GARBAGE! SEND HIM A MESSAGE. I WILL NOT PAY FOR COMIC-BOOK FANTASIES. HEY, BARNEY. HELLO, MATT. SUNSET IS AT 6:42 TODAY. GOOD TO KNOW. YOU WANT TO PLAY A COOL GAME? OH, I LOVE GAMES. THIS ONE'S LOTS OF FUN. MY UNCLE CUTTER IS GOING TO PLAY, TOO. COME ON. OKAY. MATT, LET ME IN. I'M PRACTICING. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I CAN TAKE IT. DON'T BOTHER ME. I'M PRACTICING. SO, YOU MUST THINK I'M JUST A DUMB JOCK. NO. IS THAT WHY YOU WANTED ME? FIGURE I'D BE EASY TO FOOL? NO! WELL, I GOT NEWS FOR YOU, I WILL NEVER BITE ON THE SAME FAKE TWICE, OKAY? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M TRYING TO SOLVE DAD'S MURDER. MATTY, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT. PEOPLE WERE CHASING HIM. OH, REALLY? HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? ALICE SAW THEM. ALICE. ALICE SAW-- SHE AND HER DAD WERE OUT THERE THAT NIGHT. THEY SAW A CAR SPEEDING AFTER DAD JUST BEFORE HE CRASHED. SHE'S A KID, SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SAW. THEY THINK DAD WAS A SPY! YOU HEARD MOM. I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING, CUTTER. WHAT'S THE POINT OF BEING SMART IF I CAN'T EVEN HELP DAD? I'D JUST BE A USELESS FREAK. OKAY... SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? THOSE CLASSIFIED DISCS THEY FOUND WERE EITHER PLANTED ON DAD, OR HE WAS GETTING THEM BACK. I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHY HE WENT OUT THERE. HE DIDN'T TELL ANYONE. WELL, HE WAS RUNNING AN ERRAND. WHAT? TERRY CALLED ME THE NIGHT BEFORE, LEFT A MESSAGE ON MY MACHINE. SOMETHING ABOUT NEEDING HELP WITH AN ERRAND THE NEXT DAY. WHAT KIND OF ERRAND? I NEVER, UH, TALKED TO HIM. I WAS BUSY... DIDN'T CALL HIM BACK. [cell phone ringing] HELLO? MATT, WE'RE MOVING. MOM TOLD ME TO PACK MY IMPORTANT STUFF. WE'RE GOING SOMEPLACE, AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE. WHEN? SOON, I DON'T KNOW. YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING. IT'S YOUR CALL. [TELEPHONE RINGING] [SECRETARY]: COUNTY RECORDS, HOLD, PLEASE. [telephone ringing] [SECRETARY]: COUNTY RECORDS, HOLD, PLEASE. [telephone ringing] [SECRETARY]: COUNTY RECORDS, HOLD, PLEASE. [SECRETARY]: YES, MA'AM, THAT'LL TAKE 40 DAYS. [bell dings] [SECRETARY]: I'M SORRY, MA'AM, [SECRETARY]: PERHAPS YOU WANT TO FILE A COMPLAINT. 40 DAYS. BUT I HAVE TO FIND MY UNCLE. HE'S THE ONLY FAMILY I HAVE. I CAN'T HELP THAT. WHY DON'T WE JUST CUT THE KID A BREAK, HUH? AIN'T I SEEN YOU ON TV OR SOMETHING? YEAH, HE'S CUTTER HANSON. BUT... THAT'S IT, I KNEW IT! YO, FLOYD, WE GOT CUTTER HANSON IN THE OFFICE HERE! MAN, I SAW YOU MAKE THAT HAIL MARY CATCH AGAINST GREEN BAY, SNOWING, TWO GUYS ON YOUR BACK... WELL, THREE. RAN IT 60 YARDS FOR A SCORE. MAN, THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL, MAN. WAIT, WAIT, YOU HAVE TIME FOR THIS, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO HELP ME? COOL IT, MATT. ALL RIGHT. NOW, I'M EXPECTING THE ZONE DEFENSE, RIGHT? BUT I SEE THE CORNERBACK, HE'S EDGING IN. SO I KNOW THEY'RE GOING MAN-TO-MAN. HERE. COME ON, LET ME SHOW YOU. ALL RIGHT. HERE. LET'S MOVE THIS TABLE BACK. THANK YOU, FLOYD. ALL THE WAY. CUTTER. ELROY. ELROY, GOOD TO MEET YOU. FLOYD, YOU'RE THE OUTSIDE LINEBACKER. GET INTO STANCE. CUTTER! MATT, THESE ARE FANS. NOW, WHY DON'T YOU GO DO SOMETHING USEFUL WHILE I EXPLAIN THIS, OKAY? OH, SURE. UM, SEE YA. OKAY. ELROY, RIGHT? YOU ARE THE CORNERBACK. YOU START EDGING IN, RIGHT? RIGHT. OKAY, NOW, RIGHT. YOU GUYS EVER SEE A SQUIRREL ATTACK A BEAR? BEAR DOESN'T EXPECT IT, RIGHT? (CUTTER) NO, BECAUSE THE BEAR'S A BIG ANIMAL, (CUTTER) BUT IT TAKESIT DOWN. (CUTTER) READY? SO... EDGE IN, EDGE IN... (CUTTER) BALLS UP IN 10,LET ME SEE... (CUTTER) OH! (CUTTER) SEE, YOU GOT DOWN IN POSITION. (CUTTER) GET THIS RIGHT. (CUTTER) IN POSITION. NOW RUN BACK DOWN. (CUTTER) BALLS UP IN 10. (CUTTER) YOU EVER SEE A TIGER ATTACK A GOAT? (CUTTER) IT'S UGLY! FOCUS ON ME. (CUTTER) THREE, TWO... (CUTTER) HE'S COMING, HE'S FAST, YOU KNOW IT... OH! NOW BRING IT IN. 10 STEPS AND COMING, RIGHT? HUT! OH, IT'S GOOD! NICE HANDS. NICE CATCH, OH! NICE CATCH! GOOD HANDS MUST RUN IN THE FAMILY. RIGHT, RIGHT? THANKS FOR HELPING ME GET THOSE RECORDS. IT WAS AWESOME HOW YOU PULLED THAT OFF. SO, WHAT NOW? WELL, I GUESS I'M GOING TO TELL THE POLICE. THOSE RECORDS PROVE ALICE'S PARENTS ARE USING PHONY NAMES. IT'LL BE EASY TO FIND HER REAL FAMILY. I'M GLAD YOU'RE HANDLING IT THIS WAY, MATT. IT'S GOOD. WELL, IT'S COOL DOING SOMETHING THAT MATTERS. I MEAN, PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS TELLING ME HOW MUCH POTENTIAL I HAVE, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOOD IT IS IF I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WITH IT? I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, MY DAD WAS ALL INTO "PUSHING BACK THE FRONTIERS OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE," BUT, UM, I SORT OF LIKE DOING STUFF THAT HELPS PEOPLE. LIKE WITH ALICE. IS IT WRONG THAT I LIKE THAT BETTER? NO. NO, NO, YOU'VE GOT TO DECIDE WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU, AND YOU CAN'T LIVE YOUR LIFE BY OTHER PEOPLE'S RULES. DID YOU AND MY DAD ARGUE ABOUT THAT A LOT? WELL, BROTHERS ARGUE ABOUT A LOT OF STUFF. SORT OF GOES WITH THE TERRITORY. CUTTER, THERE'S-- HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? [music intensifies] STAY HERE. OVER HERE! [gunshot fires] FBI. ALICE'S FATHER IS PROVIDING A VITAL SERVICE FOR THE GOVERNMENT. WE'VE GONE TO GREAT EXPENSE TO PROVIDE HIM AND HIS FAMILY A NEW LIFE, AND YOUR ILLEGAL SPYING IS JEOPARDIZING THAT. CAN'T YOU GUYS LIGHTEN UP? MATT WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP A FRIEND. LISTEN, SON... LISTEN, SON, I'M SURE YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU WERE DOING, BUT SOMEHOW YOU STUMBLED UPON A CLASSIFIED FBI DATABASE. THAT'S HOW WE TRACKED YOU. I DIDN'T STUMBLE. I COULD BREAK TRIPLE-BLIND ENCRYPTION SYSTEMS WHEN I WAS 6. AND THAT ATTITUDE WILL LAND YOU IN JAIL. OH, THAT'LL BOOST YOUR CAREER. I CAN SEE THE HEADLINE NOW-- "TEENAGER OUTSMARTS FBI." YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU STOP TREATING ME LIKE AN IDIOT AND ADMIT ALICE'S FAMILY IS IN THE WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM? SOMEBODY PROBABLY PUT HER PICTURE ON THOSE MILK CARTONS TO FIND THEM. YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW THE DETAILS. YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW HOW I CRACKED YOUR DATABASE. 11 YEARS AGO, ALICE'S FATHER WAS SET TO TESTIFY IN THE CASE OF A PHILLY MOB BOSS NAMED EDDIE SKINNER. JUST BEFORE THE TRIAL, A KEY WITNESS WAS MURDERED. WITHOUT HIM, THE GOVERNMENT COULDN'T GET A CONVICTION, SO WE PUT THE CASE ON ICE. ALICE'S FAMILY WENT INTO WITNESS PROTECTION. SO, SKINNER'S STILL AFTER THEM? WE JUST DEVELOPED NEW EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM. THE TRIAL'S BACK ON. ALICE'S FATHER HAS TO TESTIFY? WE NOTIFIED HIM A FEW MONTHS AGO. AND THEN WE CAME ALONG, AND NOW THEY GOT TO MOVE AGAIN. MOVE? YEAH, THAT'S WHAT ALICE SAID. SHE SAID HER PARENTS TOLD HER TO PACK. YES? IS YOUR DAD HOME? GO TO YOUR ROOM, SWEETIE. HELLO, SCOTT. GOING SOMEWHERE? THAT'S WHY HER DAD WAS SO WEIRD ABOUT REPORTING THE ACCIDENT. HE WAS AFRAID OF SKINNER. HE DIDN'T WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION. WELL, IT'S 11 YEARS. POOR GUY PROBABLY THOUGHT IT WAS OVER. [knocking] I LOST MY DUSTER. IS IT IN HERE? I DON'T KNOW, BARNEY. LOOK AROUND. ALICE HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. EASY, OKAY, SHE'S JUST A KID. SO THAT MAKES IT OKAY TO LIE TO HER? NO, LOOK, YOU CAN TELL HER SHE WASN'T KIDNAPPED. JUST DON'T TELL HER THAT SOMEONE WANTS TO KILL HER DAD, OKAY? SHE'LL BE TERRIFIED. DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO? I GUESS NOT. OKAY. I FOUND IT! GOOD. JUST PUT THAT DOWN FOR A SEC. LISTEN TO ME. I'M LISTENING. I THINK YOU SHOULD TELL THE FBI WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT YOUR FATHER'S ACCIDENT. NO, THEY WON'T LISTEN. THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM, AND YOU COULD MAKE THINGS WORSE. JUST... THINK ABOUT HOW YOUR MOM WOULD FEEL. OKAY, I'LL DO IT, AFTER THE LAB ANALYZES THE EVIDENCE FROM THE CAR. THEN I'LL HAVE MORE TO GIVE THEM. YOU LOOK WORRIED, MR. KHALIDI. IN THAT CASE, YOU'LL HAVE NO OBJECTION TO DOUBLING THE STAKES. IT'S YOUR MONEY. OH, IT WILL BE. GIN. [cell phone rings] TROUBLE. SO, THE PRODIGY IS INVESTIGATING HIS FATHER'S DEATH. LET'S HOPE HE DOESN'T GET TOO CLOSE. GENIUS IS SUCH A PRECIOUS THING TO WASTE. WORKING HARD? I THINK LIGHT IS WET. WHAT? WET IS BETTER THAN BRITTLE. OKAY. THE PROFESSOR WHO'S ANALYZING THE STUFF FROM THE CAR CALLED. IS HE DONE? YEAH. YEAH, HE SAYS THEY'RE USELESS. THAT THE SAMPLES YOU GAVE HIM ARE JUST SO COMMONPLACE, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHERE THEY'RE FROM. SORRY. ALL COMPUTERS USED BY ALICE AND HER FAMILY REMAIN DISCONNECTED. I CAN'T FIND HER. CHECK OTHER COMPUTERS SHE MIGHT BE USING. START WITH HER SCHOOL. EXCELLENT IDEA. I'LL RUN A PATTERN RECOGNITION ANALYSIS IN CASE SHE IS LOGGED IN UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME. SOMETHING'S WRONG. WANT ME TO GO WITH YOU? THAT'S OKAY. WHAT DO YOU WANT? UH... I'D LIKE TO TALK TO ALICE. YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE. JUST FOR A SECOND. HAVEN'T YOU CAUSED ENOUGH TROUBLE? THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT. (MATTHEW) WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO GO INTO OUR BUSINESS. LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED. ALICE WAS SCARED, I WAS JUST HELPING. HELP? YOU JUST MADE THINGS WORSE, MAN. HER LIFE IS IN DANGER NOW. I'M SORRY, I... YA KNOW WHAT YOUR TROUBLE IS? YOU'RE TOO SMART FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN DO SOMETHING DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD. GET OUT OF HERE. WHAT HAPPENED? ALICE'S DAD SAID I COULDN'T SEE HER. HE SAID IT'S MY FAULT THEY'RE IN DANGER. WE'VE GOT TO GET THOSE LOCKS CHANGED. AH, MASTER HANSON, I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU. I WOULD LIKE YOUR OPINION ON THIS, CHOP-CHOP. SCHMIDT HAS THE NOTION THAT METAMATERIALS CAN BE USED TO MANIPULATE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS TO CREATE INVISIBILITY. COOL BEANS. COOL BEANS, INDEED. I EXPECT YOUR ANALYSIS IN THE MORNING. OH! BY THE WAY, WHY ARE WE STORING A WRECKED VEHICLE IN THE MAINTENANCE BUILDING? THEY WANT TO KNOW WHO TO BILL. I CAN EXPLAIN. EXPLAIN IT TO YOUR MOTHER. I'VE REFERRED THEM TO HER. I NEVER WANTED TO SEE THIS CAR AGAIN. ALL THE HORRIBLE MEMORIES JUST CAME BACK THE SECOND I WALKED IN HERE. I'M SORRY, MOM. DIDN'T YOU REALIZE THAT? DIDN'T YOU THINK ABOUT HOW I WOULD FEEL? THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T TELL YOU. YOU'RE BEING REALLY SELFISH, MATTHEW. I'M JUST TRYING TO PROVE DAD'S CRASH-- STOP! YOU JUST HAVE TO STOP THIS. IT IS CONSUMING YOU. DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS? IT'S NOT CUTTER'S FAULT. DID YOU? YEAH. I KNEW THAT THIS WAS A BAD IDEA. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HIM. I AM. BY HELPING HIM WITH THIS? BY GETTING SOME ANSWERS TO WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT AND BY MAYBE CLEARING HIS FATHER'S NAME. YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO TELL MATT ABOUT THAT. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? HE DIDN'T TELL ME. YOU DID. I OVERHEARD YOU TALKING THE OTHER NIGHT. WELL, IT'S OVER. A TOW TRUCK'S COMING TO HAUL IT AWAY. NO, YOU CAN'T! YOU GO BACK TO THE INSTITUTE, AND WE WILL DISCUSS THIS LATER. JUST LET ME CHECK THE CAR AGAIN. NO. PLEASE, MOM. COME ON, MATT, IT'S NOT A GAME. MATTHEW. MATTHEW! GET OUT. CALL OFF THE TOW TRUCK. THIS ISN'T FUNNY, MATT. GIVE ME ONE HOUR. YOU GET OUT THIS INSTANT. ONE HOUR, PLEASE! I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU ONE SECOND, OKAY? LOOK! LOOK! LOOK AT WHAT? THERE'S A SPIDER WEB ON THE WINDSHIELD. YEAH, SO? THIS CAN TELL US A LOT. CERTAIN SPIDERS CAN ONLY BE FOUND IN CERTAIN AREAS. SWEETHEART... JUST LET ME GET IT EXAMINED, PLEASE. THAT'S ALL I WANT. YOU OKAY? COME ON. DOOR. COULDN'T WE JUST HAVE TAKEN THE SPIDER? PROFESSOR PEACOCK? PROFESSOR PEACOCK? WHAT? I'M MATTHEW HANSON... FROM THE INSTITUTE. I CALLED? WE HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU TO EXAMINE. YES, YES, OF COURSE YOU DO. JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. ALL RIGHT, LEAVE IT. I'LL GET TO IT LATER. AND WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE US TO PUT IT? ARE YOU SURE YOU GOT THE RIGHT DEPARTMENT? (EDISON) FINALLY! ALICE WANTS TO MEET YOU TOMORROW. WHEN AND WHERE, EDISON? SHE'LL BE AT THE PARK AT 5:00. IS THAT OKAY? YEAH, YEAH. I CAN PICK YOU UP OUT FRONT AT, UM, 4:30. TELL ALICE I'LL BE THERE. CONSIDER IT DONE. YOU WANT LUNCH? [helicopter crashes] YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT HUNGRY? THIS COULD WORK, CUTTER. [cell phone rings] CUTTER. MANNY CALLED. THE DEAL IS ON. SYD? SAYS YOU GOT TO BE HERE TO CLOSE. YEAH... YOU FIRED ME, REMEMBER? YOU'RE GOING TO LET A LITTLE THING LIKE THAT COME BETWEEN US? WE'RE TALKIN' A MILLION THREE GROSS. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED ALL YOUR TOES JUST TO COUNT YOUR COMMISSION. WHEN DO YOU NEED ME THERE? 3:00. TODAY? YOU GOT SOMETHING BETTER TO DO THAN TO GET RICH? NO, I DON'T. I'LL BE THERE. LOOK, MATT, SOMETHING'S COME UP. I WILL BE THERE TO MEET ALICE, BUT I GOT TO GO. OKAY. OKAY. I WANT YOU TO ZOOM IN, OKAY, AND STOP MOVING THAT THING AROUND SO MUCH. ZOOM IN ON THE SHIELD, OKAY? I WANT YOU TO START... WE'RE GOING TO START WITH A CLOSE-UP, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? OH, HEY, BUDDY. MANNY WANTS A PROMOTIONAL SPOT OF YOU PUSHING HIS DEVELOPMENT. I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS. MAKE TIME. ALL RIGHT? ACTION! ACTION! ACTION! NOBODY GETS PAST THE SHIELD AT CRYSTAL VISTA HOMES. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. DO IT AGAIN. WOW... I THINK I'VE CRACKED INVISIBILITY, CUTTER. IT'D BE EASY TO MAKE A PROTOTYPE OF THE FIELD GENERATOR. CUTTER? [alarm clock sounds TIME TO MEET ALICE. OR MAYBE YOU HAVE SOMETHING BETTER TO DO. ALICE. CAME AS FAST AS I COULD. SORRY FOR BEING OFF-LINE. MY PARENTS ARE WATCHING EVERY SECOND. THEY THINK I'M AT THE LIBRARY. NO PROBLEM. ARE YOU OKAY? IS THAT GUY FOLLOWING YOU? RELAX. IT'S JUST FBI AGENTS KEEPING AN EYE ON YOU. FBI AGENTS? DIDN'T YOUR PARENTS EXPLAIN? WHAT'S GOING ON? ALL I CAN SAY IS I CHECKED YOUR RECORDS. YOU WEREN'T KIDNAPPED. THOSE ARE YOUR REAL PARENTS. YOU'RE THE BEST. IF I ASK YOU TO DO SOMETHING YOU'LL DO IT, RIGHT? LIKE WHAT? LIKE RUN! COME ON! GO AROUND THAT WAY. CUT 'EM OFF! HERE. TAKE MY HAND. THINK IT'S SAFE? NOT YET. GOTCHA! [ALICE SCREAMS] (MATTHEW) COME ON! GET AFTER THEM! GO! OVER THERE! CAR. COME ON. OH, NO. [car tires screech] THIS WAY. LET'S GO. THEY'RE GOING TO FIND US. [car engine revs] DO SOMETHING. [car alarm sounds] [multiple car alarms sound] COME ON. NEED A LIFT? HOW DID YOU FIND US? CHECK YOUR BACKPACK. A HOMING DEVICE? YEAH. YOU GOT BRAINS, I GOT FRIENDS. WHAT'S GOING ON? IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. WHO'S CHASING YOU NOW, MATT? WHY DO YOU CARE? I SAID I'D BE THERE. YOU SHOULD HAVE WAITED. I PROMISED TO MEET ALICE. I KEEP MY PROMISES. YOU'RE LUCKY I GOT THERE. [whistles] WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENING? IT MUST'VE BEEN SOMETHING I DID. ONE OF THE DATABASES I SEARCHED COULD'VE BEEN PROGRAMMED TO REVEAL MY LOCATION. THAT'S HOW SKINNER FOUND 'EM. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. IT'S THE ONLY EXPLANATION. I'M TOO SMART FOR MY OWN GOOD. HEY... HEY, DON'T SAY THAT, OKAY? YOUR FATHER WOULDN'T LIKE IT. JUST SIT DOWN. (ALICE'S FATHER) YOU'RE NOT DOING A VERY GOOD JOB. (ALICE'S FATHER) STOP LYING TO ME! YOU CAN'T PROTECT US. THIS PROVES IT. I'M NOT EXPOSING MY FAMILY TO MORE DANGER. THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY IS TO PUT SKINNER AWAY FOR LIFE. THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID LAST TIME AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED. WE'RE THE ONES WITH THE LIFE SENTENCE. THAT WASN'T THE BUREAU'S FAULT. YOU LET SKINNER MURDER YOUR PRIME WITNESS. THAT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED IF HE'D DONE WHAT WE TOLD HIM. HE GOT SCARED, AND HE RAN. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE. OUR MISTAKE WAS LISTENING TO YOU PEOPLE. IT'S NOT LIKE THAT THIS TIME. WITH YOUR TESTIMONY, WE CAN NAIL SKINNER. YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT. WE HAVE A SLAM-DUNK CASE. NO, NO. IT'S TOO MUCH OF A RISK. I MEAN, SKINNER COULD WALK. DON'T BE HASTY. JUST SLEEP ON IT. SLEEP? YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING. WHAT'LL HAPPEN IF ALICE'S FATHER DOESN'T TESTIFY? I DON'T KNOW. THE FBI WILL KEEP HELPING THEM, WON'T THEY? MAYBE. (ALICE'S FATHER) ...RUNNING FOR YEARS. IT HAS GOT TO STOP. THEY'VE GOT TO, CUTTER. WE'LL ARRANGE A NEW SAFE HOUSE. WE'LL COME BY TOMORROW. GOODBYE, MATT. NEVER TALK TO HIM AGAIN. THE KID'S TOO SMART FOR HIS OWN GOOD. YOU OKAY, HONEY? YEAH. I DON'T KNOW, YOU SEEM KIND OF DOWN. DID... DID DAD JUST LIKE ME BECAUSE I'M SMART? BABY, WHY WOULD YOU THINK SUCH A THING? MOST OF THE STUFF WE DID TOGETHER WAS SHOWING OFF HOW SMART I AM. YOUR FATHER LOVED YOU. MORE THAN ANYTHING. YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT. HE NEVER SAID SO. COME HERE, COME HERE. OKAY, UM... SOMETIMES, PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS THEIR FEELINGS. THEY JUST CAN'T, AND YOUR FATHER WAS LIKE THAT, BUT HE LOVED YOU, AND HE WAS SO, SO PROUD OF YOU. SO PROUD. WHATEVER BUSINESS YOU'RE IN, KHALIDI, I'D SAY BUSINESS IS GOOD. QUITE GOOD. YEAH? WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD GET INTO IT MYSELF, HUH? WHEN I CONTACTED YOU, MR. SKINNER, IT WAS IN THE BELIEF THAT WE HAD INTERESTS IN COMMON. THAT BY HELPING YOU WITH YOUR WITNESS, I MIGHT BY ABLE TO DEAL WITH A NUISANCE THAT I WAS FACING. AND WHAT NUISANCE IS THAT? THIS BOY, THIS TROUBLESOME BOY, THREATENS MY AFFAIRS. YOU DISAPPOINTED ME, EDDIE. THE BOY LED YOU RIGHT TO THE GIRL. ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS FOLLOW HER HOME. INSTEAD, YOU MADE FOOLS OF YOURSELVES AND YOU LET THEM BOTH GET AWAY. WE'LL FIND HER. YOU HAD 11 YEARS TO FIND THAT FAMILY. YOUR TRIAL IS IN TWO WEEKS. EVEN IF WE DON'T, HE'S RUNNING PLENTY SCARED. HE'S NEVER GOING TO TESTIFY AGAINST ME. SO, YOU'RE WILLING TO BET LIFE IN PRISON ON YOUR JUDGMENT OF HUMAN NATURE? I'M LISTENING. MY SOURCE CAN FIND YOUR WITNESS AND HIS FAMILY. IN EXCHANGE FOR THAT INFORMATION, I WANT YOU TO STEAL SOMETHING FOR ME. PROFESSOR PEACOCK. PROFESSOR PEACOCK! NO NEED TO SHOUT. COULD YOU TELL ANYTHING? OH, YES, YES, YES. THE WEB WAS PERFECTLY PRESERVED. IT ALWAYS AMAZES ME HOW STRONG THEY ARE. DID YOU FIND OUT WHAT TYPE OF SPIDER MADE IT? YES. IT IS THE WORK OF A LARGE ARANEUS. A MATURE FEMALE, I WOULD SAY. DO YOU KNOW THE, UH, THE... ARANEUS. YEAH. DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT LIVES? WE NEED TO TRACK DOWN WHERE THE CAR PICKED IT UP. OH, WELL, THAT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY. YOU SEE, THE ARANEUS IS FOUND EVERYWHERE. I THOUGHT CERTAIN TYPES OF SPIDERS WERE ONLY FOUND IN CERTAIN AREAS. [chuckles] OH, YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING TOO MUCH TV. WELL, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THE TETRAOPES FEMORATUS MIGHT BE MUCH MORE HELPFUL TO YOU. AND WHAT IS THAT? IT IS AN INSECT THAT I FOUND CAUGHT IN THE WEB. COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE "MILKWEED BEETLE." YES... IT ISN'T NATIVE IN THIS REGION. THE TETRAOPES FEMORATUS IS FOUND ONLY WHERE MILKWEED GROWS, AND IT DOESN'T GROW AROUND HERE. IN FACT, THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE I KNOW WHERE YOU CAN FIND SUCH SPECIMENS, AND THAT IS IN THE LANDSCAPING ON A CERTAIN PRIVATE ESTATE. HUH? YES. THE COUNTY TAX RECORDS LIST THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY AS AN ANONYMOUS CAYMAN ISLAND CORPORATION. THAT ALL YOU GOT? PATIENCE, YOUNG MAN. THINGS TEND TO LOOK DIFFERENT FROM THE AIR. YOU SURE THIS DOESN'T BELONG TO A FRIEND OF YOUR DAD'S? I'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE. THAT CAYMAN ISLAND CORPORATION IS OWNED BY AN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSMAN NAMED ANTWAN KHALIDI. INTERPOL BELIEVES HE IS A MAJOR ARMS DEALER ON THE BLACK MARKET. THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE. WELL, THIS KHALIDI MUST BE-- KHALIDI IS BEHIND ALL OF THIS. HE'S GOT A SPY IN THE INSTITUTE. THIS WHOLE PLACE COULD BE BUGGED. YOU KNOW, YOUR DAD MUST HAVE FOUND OUT WHO IT WAS. INVISIBILITY COULD BE THE GREATEST WEAPON EVER. THAT'S WHAT KHALIDI WANTS. DO YOU KNOW WHO THE SPY IS? I'VE GOT AN IDEA. COME ON. THIS'LL BE A CINCH. [ELECTRICAL CRACKLING] OH! HOW IS MATTHEW DOING? IS HE ALMOST FINISHED? PATIENCE, DOC. YOU CAN'T RUSH THE CREATIVE PROCESS. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO? YEAH. HOW ABOUT A LARGE DOUBLE PEPPERONI WITH ROOT BEER? CHOP-CHOP. GO! GO! OH! WELL? SHOW IT TO ME. I MUST SEE IT AT ONCE. NO. NOT UNTIL THE CONFERENCE. BUT-- NOBODY TOUCHES IT. IF THEY DO, I'LL KNOW ABOUT IT. ALL RIGHT. WHATEVER YOU SAY. ALL RIGHT, KID, LET'S PACK UP. DOES IT REALLY WORK? I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO GO HOME. NEED TO GET MY IPOD FIRST. DO YOU TRUST HAAS NOT TO MESS WITH THE PROTOTYPE? LET HER TRY. IT'S JUST JUNK WITHOUT THIS. AND WHAT'S THAT? IT'S A FLASHDRIVE WITH THE INVISIBILITY PROGRAM ON IT. WOULDN'T IT BE A LOT SAFER IF THAT WAS LOCKED IN THE SECURITY VAULT? WHERE EVERYONE WOULD LOOK FOR IT? EDISON. COPY THE CONTENTS OF THE FLASHDRIVE ONTO THE EMPTY FLASHDRIVE. WHAT FILE NAME SHOULD I GIVE IT? "WONDERLAND." FOR ALICE. I LIVE TO SERVE. I'LL LEAVE THE COPY HERE... AND KEEP THE ORIGINAL WITH ME. I'VE GOT A NEW WORD, MATT. CAN I PUT IT UP? UH, NOT RIGHT NOW. WHEN I COME BACK. SEE YOU, BARNEY. BYE. NOW WHAT? WE WAIT. THIEF! THIEF! CALL 911! THIEF! THIEF! HOW COULD YOU DO THIS, BARNEY? GOT A NEW WORD FOR YOU, BUSTED. AND THEY SAID I WAS TOO SMALL. THEY SAID I WAS SMALL. YOU'VE BEEN SPYING FOR KHALIDI. I WANT A LAWYER. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A DOCTOR FIRST. STOP IT, STOP IT! HOW DID YOU FIGURE IT OUT? I DISCOVERED MY IPOD WAS RIGGED TO WORK AS A TRANSMITTER. SOMEONE WAS LISTENING TO EVERYTHING I SAID. AND YOURS WAS THE RECEIVER. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR DAD WAS AN ACCIDENT. I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. HE CAUGHT ME DELIVERING SOME COMPUTER DISCS, AND HE TOOK 'EM BACK. KHALIDI SENT HIS MEN AFTER HIM. YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT ALICE, TOO. THAT'S HOW SKINNER FOUND HER. KHALIDI GOT WORRIED WHEN I TOLD HIM YOU WERE CHECKING OUT YOUR DAD'S ACCIDENT. HE FIGURED IF SKINNER GOT INVOLVED AND SHOWED UP, HE WOULD DISTRACT YOU. I'M REAL SORRY, MATT. THEN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. HELP US CLEAR DAD'S NAME AND WE'LL HELP YOU. HOW? [mysterious music] WELL? THE REVIEW CONFERENCE IS ON FRIDAY. FRIDAY? YEAH, THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO SHOW THE PROTOTYPE FOR THE INVISIBILITY GENERATOR. FRIDAY. YEAH, YOU SHOULD DO IT THEN. ARE YOU TRYING TO ENTRAP ME? IS THE FBI LISTENING? NOBODY SENT ME! YOU'RE LYING. OKAY, BARNEY, TRUTH TIME. OKAY, OKAY. THE KID AND HIS UNCLE CAUGHT ME TRYING TO STEAL THE PROGRAM. THEY WERE GOING TO TURN ME IN IF I DIDN'T HELP CATCH YOU. BY LURING ME THERE ON FRIDAY? YEAH. THE FBI WILL HAVE THE INSTITUTE STAKED OUT. I'M REAL SORRY, MR. KHALIDI. I HAD NO CHOICE. WELL, IF THE PLAN IS FOR FRIDAY, WE'LL GO A DAY EARLY. ALL RIGHT... HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO. LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY. [cell phone rings] YEAH? THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE OF PLANS. YEAH. YEAH. AS THE DIRECTOR OF THIS INSTITUTE, I INSIST ON EXAMINING IT. YOU'LL SEE IT WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE DOES. THE REPUTATION OF THIS INSTITUTE IS AT STAKE. I WILL NOT RISK BEING HUMILIATED IF YOUR DEVICE FAILS. [ALARM SOUNDS] WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT'S HAPPENED? [ALARM'S VOICE]: FIRE! FIRE! I'VE GOT TO SAVE MY FILES! MATTHEW! MATTHEW! LET'S GO. COME ON. COME ON, THIS WAY. [ALARM CONTINUES] [INTENSE MUSIC] GO! ANY PROBLEMS? FROM A BUNCH OF GEEKS? AND THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM? ALL RIGHT. YOU GOT YOUR GADGET. NOW WHERE'S MY WITNESS? I CAN TELL YOU. I HAVE TO WARN YOU GUYS, YOU'VE BROKEN A BUNCH OF FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. THAT'S A TOP-SECRET MACHINE THAT YOU BOOSTED, SO YOU'D BETTER SURRENDER. SURRENDER TO WHO? ME. WASTE HIM. I GUESS THEY SHOWED YOU. GUESS YOU SHOWED ME. THAT'S ATTEMPTED MURDER. WHO ARE YOU? WE'RE THE CYBER POLICE, EDDIE. WE'RE IN YOUR COMPUTERS, YOUR TELEVISIONS, YOUR ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSHES... AND WE'RE ALWAYS WATCHING. [police sirens] FBI! DROP YOUR WEAPON! FBI. FREEZE. HANDS UP! FBI. INTO THE ROOM, MOVE IT! MOVE IT! THAT WAS FOR TERRY. AWESOME, CUTTER. YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS? YOU'RE TOO SMART FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. THE MACHINE, DOES IT WORK? DID YOU DO IT? HE FELL FOR IT, JUST LIKE YOU SAID, MATT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I DO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS DELAY. I'M SURE THAT IT WILL ONLY BE A MATTER OF MOMENTS. MATTHEW. MATTHEW. WHAT IS IT? MATTHEW! (DR. HAAS) WHAT IS THIS? (DR. HAAS) STOP PLAYING! [crowd gasps] (DR. HAAS) WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? [crowd gasps] LOOK, LOOK! AH, HA HA. OH! HA HA HA! [applause] CONGRATULATIONS MATTHEW! CONGRATULATIONS! DADDY WOULD HAVE BEEN SO PROUD OF YOU, SWEETIE. NOT JUST FOR WHAT YOU DID IN THERE, BUT WHAT YOU DID FOR HIM. CONGRATULATIONS, MATTHEW. HA HA HA! ELLEN, COULD I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU ABOUT HIS FUTURE? HI. HI. WE'RE GOING HOME. THE FBI SAID IT'S SAFE NOW. THAT'S GREAT, ALICE. I'M NOT ALICE ANYMORE. I'M SARAH. SO YOU'RE LEAVING? WE'RE GOING BACK TO OUR REAL HOME... IN PHILADELPHIA. THAT'S A LONG WAY. NOT FOR SOMEONE WHO INVENTED INVISIBILITY. YEAH, BUT I STILL CAN'T DRIVE. IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT, MAYBE WE'LL COME BACK. I HOPE YOU DO. YOU'RE THE BEST FRIEND I'VE EVER HAD. EVERY KID SHOULD HAVE A FRIEND LIKE YOU. I WAS WRONG ABOUT YOU, MATT. I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID, BUT YOU'VE GIVEN US OUR LIVES BACK, AND IF THERE'S EVER ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU... JUST DON'T TELL MY MOM. DEAL. I GUESS WE SHOULD GO. THANK YOU. IT'S HARD WORK, HUH? SHE WAS PERFECT, CUTTER. YEAH. FIRST GIRLFRIEND ALWAYS IS. WHO WAS THAT GIRL? OH... JUST A GIRL MATT AND I HELPED THE OTHER DAY. SHE WAS LOST AND, UH, WE HELPED HER GET HOME.
