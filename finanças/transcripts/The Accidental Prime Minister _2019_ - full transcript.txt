Extracted by NARACHI Who should be our leader? Soniaji and no other. - Long live... - Sonia Gandhi. - Long live... - Sonia Gandhi. No more questions. You will all come to know tomorrow. Ma'am, just one question! Please! The BJP has lost this election. But maybe they are not ready to admit. They are strongly opposing Sonia Gandhi's ascend to the Prime Minister's post and constantly demonstrating against her. Sir, what is your opinion? These are baseless arguments. Sonia ma'am has won the election. So she will be the PM. There is no scope for debate in this, Rahul. It's pretty simple and clear. We have won this election under the leadership of Ma'am. And she shall be PM. This is a land where great sages, ascetics, saints, and learned men want to be born. But Sonia Gandhi refused to accept this country as her homeland for 16 years. The ordeal that my... grandma, and father had to go through can you guarantee my mother won't face the same consequences. This is our family matter. I admit you're perfectly right in your own way. But you must understand, every party worker wants to see Sonia ma'am as the PM. This is more than a family matter now. A person who had to accept citizenship of this country due to constitutional compulsion and not because she wanted to. Are they unable to find a leader, born in this country, to lead us. We don't want a foreigner as our Prime Minister. And, I won't let it happen. With all due respect, Mr Kapil, please don't teach me politics. Friends. For the last 6 years, one thing has been pretty clear in my mind. And I've often mentioned that my goal is not the Prime Minister's Post. And now my conscience is telling me that I should politely refuse to accept this post. No-no-no-no... - Calm down! - No-no-no... What is your opinion on Sonia Gandhi's decision? Look, Sonia ma'am is my mother. And she's made this decision after much reconsideration and assessing her conscience. And if her conscience is telling her, then this decision is right. Well, this is her decision, a decision made from her heart. There's nothing we can say. It's not an easy decision to make. Sonia is my mother. And I am proud of her. All I can say is that there's no other person in this country who can make a similar decision. I know I could've never taken such a decision in the same situation. Long Live Sonia Gandhi! How should be our leader? Soniaji and no other. Soniaji and no other. Sonia Gandhi's refusal to the PM's post has created a stir. Who is going to be the Prime Minister of the world's largest democracy is still a mystery. Seniority is the most important issue. We need a leader who is respected by all. Look... Seniority and respect are fine. But, we'll have to think about our alliance as well. After all, this is a Allied Government. We need someone who can appease all the groups. This is a very big challenge for me. I want all of you to support my decision. And this wasn't an easy decision for me to make. I thought about many people. About the future of this party. About the country. And, after carefully reviewing every aspect. I believe that only one man fits the bill perfectly. For the Prime Minister's post... I've chosen Dr. Manmohan Singh. No power in this world can stop the deliberations, the conception for which the time has come. India's time has arrived. I would like to tell this assembly, that our country shall emerge as an Economic super power and no power in the world can stop it. I, Manmohan Singh, swear on God that I shall discharge my duties as the Prime Minister with utmost dedication and sincerity. And never make public any knowledge that I obtain as the Prime Minister intentionally or unintentionally! Master Stroke. The tea served in the Secretariat is pretty sweet. It's how I've made many bitter enemies. These handful people run a country with a population of 1 billion people. They decide the fate of this country, and I write their story. That's my job. Hi. I am Sanjaya Baru. Editor, Financial Express. So, Mr Sanjaya, are you looking for your headlines? You're the headlines these days, Mr Chauhan. So, which Ministry are they giving you? Finance... Minister of State. Congratulations. That's a big post. Who will be your Cabinet Minister? The Prime Minister will keep the Finance Ministry. Is it true? The Prime Minister told me personally. You don't need to think twice before making this your headlines. Excuse me. Welcome back in the Government, Anna. Thank you, Baru, thank you. - What's new? - You tell me. Which Ministry are they giving you? Finance. What else? I see... But I heard that the PM's keeping the Finance Ministry. Baru, if the PM looks after Finance, then what will I do? Baru. Your editorial came true. The party finally called in the doctor. Years later we have a PM who has no connection to real estate. But... Politics is not Economics. Will he survive? Narsimha Rao ran his government for 5 years despite being in minority. I am sure the Doctor has learnt something from his mentor. Chauhan. Sir. Mr Baru you will have to change your headline. Chidambaram will be the new Finance Minister. But the PM told you personally, didn't he? Maybe he did so in excitement without asking the high command. Is this even possible? 'Child's name. Name's Manmohan Singh.' 'And his date of birth. Who cares about the date of birth.' 'It's not like he's going to be the Prime Minister.' 'I mean write whatever you like.' Manmohan Singh didn't win this election. The people chose madam. And madam chose Manmohan Singh. And this fact should reflect at every level. Mr Patel, it's easier said than done. It has to be constitutionally and legally fitted in. He is right, Patel sir. The PMO has unprecedented control over the policies. This won't be easy. We'll decide the Polices. A National Advisory Committee shall be formed. And madam shall be the chairperson. And they will work towards the development of the underprivileged. Yes... And this will keep the 'Left Front' happy. We'll have to appoint a loyal bureaucrat in the Prime Minister's office. Do you have anyone in mind? Pulok Chatterjee. Who else? That's good advice. Sir, here's a list of your people approved by 10 Janpath. The list has become pretty small. 'Pulok Chatterjee.' 'Gandhi family's close...' 'He's getting the PM's list of people approved by Sonia Gandhi.' What will be your job, Pulok? Sir my job will be to maintain communiqu√© between the NAC and the PMO. Sir, that will be unconstitutional. What will be your brief? Sir, my brief is to brief madam. If she has knowledge of your decisions, then it will only make her job easier. So the Prime Minister's job will be decided by the NAC. No, no, no, sir. That will be unconstitutional. NAC will advise you about matters that are in the interest of the nation. So I can decide whether I should work for National Interest, or not? Thank you. Thank you, sir. 'Finally, the PM thought about me.' 'And I received a call.' Back in those days, he was the Chairman of the UGC. I did a detailed interview about him in our first meeting. I received a call from Dr Singh's office once the interview was published. People often called me to praise me for my article. 'I am a perfectionist.' Please sit. Sir, that's a really nice tie you're wearing. Your tape recorder wasn't working. Yes, sir. Did you get it fixed? No, sir. I bought a new one. Please give it to Mr Kadhu. Did you read the interview that you did on me? You are a journalist, you should be aware of the conditions prevalent in the country. It is a big problem. And that's why I intentionally mentioned South Korea. We need reforms like them in our country. Your job was to convey this to the people. But you failed in doing so. Sir, I published your entire interview. Maybe there was some error at the News Desk. I will get it checked. What's the point now? And blame someone else. Mr Baru, your subordinate's mistake is your mistake. Sanjaya, will you be my Press Secretary? Of course, sir. But I have two conditions. I want to be your media advisor. In the age of the Internet, Press Secretary sounds so outdated. I am okay about that. And your second condition. I will report only to you. Ma'am, you don't have to take the trouble. Spare me the lecture on protocol. I've been making tea in my house for the last 30 years. There's no protocol amongst family. Thank you. Other than managing the media what else do you expect of me. As the PM it often gets difficult to stay connected to the ground. All you can see are files, Ministers, and Bureaucrats around you. I want every piece of news. I want to hear the truth from you, without any fear, or expectation. Politics is just like Mahabharata. Sanjaya, you have to be my eyes and ears. You can be his eyes and ears, but what about his voice? Ma'am, this is not my turf. You may not understand this turf, but bureaucracy is a turf war. Everyone has their eyes on everyone. If you give them some space then the third person will seize the opportunity. And you must keep reminding him that over and over again. 'Sir's prediction came true pretty soon.' 'And it started with Mani.' Mani sir has sent this. Just a second, baby. In any PMO, connections are very important. My connection with Doctor did not go down well with three people. Mani. Original name; JN Dixit. National Security Advisor. An expert in foreign Policies. And my good friend. Since he was an expert, He knew everyone's job better than them. And that's why defeating me in a turf war is difficult. Mike, Original name M K Narayanan. By profession a spy, former Intelligence Bureau Chief. Madam's close confidante. He knew which Minister has invested his money where. Whether he was angry or in a jolly mood, he always said one thing to everyone. Listen. I have a file on you. Compared to Mike and Mani, Dr. Singh's Principal Secretary TKA Nair didn't have much say. But I will get the corner office. And finally, Subu. The PM's Personal Secretary. Subu had only one passion. Astrology. But the PM has no interest in astrology. Sir. You must look at this. For some of the briefings, we shall need NAC's approval so what is wrong with it. Sir, just like Mani is your advisor. So am I. And sir, I requested you that I will report only to you. Calm down. Sit. I am the only person on your entire team who is not a bureaucrat. The 24-hour media doesn't wait for notes, files, or approvals. If we don't reply against a lie within 24 hours, then it's accepted as the truth, sir. Fine, I will talk to Mani. Baru. Such temper over a routine circular. That too with friends. Come on. Let's have some nice coffee. Guess who spoke to me this morning? Who? Natwar Singh. Ohh... what was he saying? He sounded concerned. Was saying that you're still clearing his files. You know what, Baru, even the Foreign Secretary of America is scared of its National Security Advisor. Let him tell the PM. I will handle it. Anyway, stop worrying. Have... a cigar. Smoking in the PMO. Isn't it restricted? There are no rules for us. We're the PMO. We're the PMO. Even on the 10th day, the Prime Minister wasn't allowed to speak. I will give you a chance after this. Sources have confirmed that the Prime Minister speech will be tabled without reading. Maybe this will be the first time in history. Even the 'Left Party' are pretty angry with the Prime Minister. The Government is appointing people from private companies in the Planning Commission. People from Multinational Companies. Lending our support doesn't mean we turn a blind eye. Tomorrow if you appoint Coca Cola on the Planning Commission, do you think we'll take it lying down? 'Everyone was taking advantage of the Prime Minister's weakness.' 'I had a bad habit.' 'Which minister leaks news against the Prime Minister and on whose beckon' 'I would find that out in under an hour.' How did the media learn about the letter that Sonia ma'am wrote to me? Does this suit an intelligent minister like you? Somebody is misleading you, sir. I haven't done anything wrong. Don't insult my intelligence. This should not be repeated again. Am I clear? Am I clear? Yes, PM sir. Sir, Jairam looked pretty upset. After a certain age, one's capacity to face the music keeps decreasing. He will behave in the future. No, sir. Frankly, this will never stop. Something else will leak out tomorrow. They have unwavering loyalty. Don't pass judgment. So... what should we do now? They leaked Sonia madam's letter. Now I will leak your reply to Sonia ma'am. That will be a very bold step. I'm taking it, sir. Everyone will get the message. PMO means business. No-no-no, sir. That Dr. Singh means business. My fellow countrymen. While h... hu... humbly addressing you... In accordance with the duties conferred on me by you. This addressal reminds me of a quote by Gandhiji. He used to say that he wants to wipe tears from every eye. He used to say that before performing any task, you must know what is your contribution to the lives of those who are poorer than the poor? Was that okay? Now how do I answer that? Okay, let me try. No-no-no-no-no, sir. If you speak like this, I will definitely lose my job. The Prime Minister's addressal should reflect faith. Speak as I showed you. Take a pause at the commas. Stress more on the words that are marked in bold. - Shall we try again, sir? - Okay. Sanjaya, how much work does it still need? About 99%, sir. Oh no... My fellow countrymen. I am... I am humbly addressing you... Hello. Sir, things went terribly wrong today. You must manage the media, sir. Will you tell me what happened? Sir, a delegation came to suggest changes in the finance bill. Manmohan, we want some changes in the finance bill. The PM wasn't on his seat. He was standing. So even the delegation had to stand. They handed over the file to the PM while standing. And since the table wasn't high enough, he dropped the file in a hurry. Maybe there was no time for tea. Everyone was standing. And now media is putting allegations against him that he threw the file. Did he keep the file down or did he throw it down? He kept it down, sir. And, what if he threw it? This is no time to take a step back, Subu. Tell me exactly how it happened. The PM is not some rubber stamp or a paper tiger. I am on my way. Look, the Opposition plays an important role in Parliamentary Democracy. And if this is how you will treat the Opposition leaders then it will be held in contempt of the Parliament. Everyone was noticing the change in Dr Singh's attitude. The Opposition, Congress. Everyone was surprised. Come, Mr. Navin. Sit. Sir. Yes. Even Orrisa deserves a special package like Bihar. Money doesn't grow on trees, Navin. But sir... Social Economic. Come in, Mr. Nair. Tea/coffee for you, Mr. Navin? Sir. Thank you. Sir. This addressal reminds me of a quote by Gandhiji. He used to say that he wants to wipe tears from every eye. The TV speech was a fantastic idea. It had a commendable impact. Amazing. You very well know who wrote the speech. Right, Baru. Well done. Thank you. He's been getting applauses. What else are you scouring the magazine for? According to Sonia, Dr Singh should be a political PM. Can you believe it? Well, he's getting the branding. No, Mike. For this to come true, the country should hear it from Dr. Singh and not Sonia ma'am. The government will complete 100 days in power, right? We should call for a press conference. But, even a single mistake won't go down well with the media. I know. PM sir is so soft-spoken. And very shy. He won't be able to handle it. All your efforts will be in vain. Nothing will be in vain. This is our opportunity, boys. Anyone can ask anything they want to the PM. He's not afraid to answer any question. Sir, if there's a question on Pakistan, please speak limited about Musharraf. Mani, I am not some kindergarten child. Just tell me the facts. And let me decide what I want to say. PM sir, I'll take your leave. Sir, I'm leaving for the press conference and, I think you should freshen up too. Sanjaya, do tigers ever brush their teeth? Please welcome our honourable Prime Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh. Let's start with the questions. - Sir! - Sir! It's believed that Sonia Gandhi is the super Prime Minister. What is your opinion? Sonia is the Congress Party President and the Chairperson of UPA. But that doesn't mean there are two power centres. Mr Prime Minister, it's believed that if you're ever asked to do something that you feel isn't right then you will resign. Well, madam, your information is wrong. No one can coerce me to tender my resignation. The Government will fulfil its term. Sir US is opposing our Nuclear Programme. You are scheduled to meet President Bush. What will you say to him? I will say, Mr Bush, Nuclear Power can be used to manufacture bombs as well as electricity. It's just cosmetics. If public relations could get you power, then even you could've become a minister. Don't underestimate Dr. Singh, Mr. Patel. Underestimate. The Doctor has only one legacy, economic reform. He shouldn't expect anything more, nor will anything else happen. Do you think the 'Left Front' will agree with the Doctor? It's the 21st century, anything is possible. Mr Thakur, Politics is the game for those who win the elections. Those who don't fight elections never win. Why so serious, Mani? Why does Natwar Singh want to go inside with the PM? PM sir should meet with Bush all alone. So that they can set in the new agenda properly. I have an idea. - Now... - Mr Natwar Singh. Sir, we won't get this opportunity again. If America declares us a nuclear state then it will clear our path for the United Nations Security Council. It's important to end nuclear isolation, Mani. May I come in, sir? Yes, Sanjaya, come in. Mani, can I speak with the PM alone for a minute? I'll be outside, sir, if you need me. Pardon me, sir, but I am afraid I've some bad news. Ex-Prime Minister Rao passed away a while ago. He was a great personality. Indeed he was, sir. I have an important job for you. It's a sensitive issue. Tell me. Your father used to write Mr Rao's speeches. You're close to their family. Please request them to perform the final rites at Hyderabad. Is there an issue with Delhi? Hyderabad is his birthplace. Isn't Delhi his place of action? Don't get into all this. Just talk to his family. That's not my job. Such a treatment with the former PM. A man who dedicated his life to the service of the country. And as per my knowledge, he has no family in Hyderabad. I will talk to Sonia ma'am. Sir, Ahmed Patel is Sonia madam's voice. I guess there's not enough space left on Raj Ghat for his tomb. Will the party decide the legacy of a great leader like Rao sir? Not the party, sir. 'Raj Ghat' I've often seen Politics stoop pretty low. But never this much. It was another blow for Doctor Sir. When Mani died due to a cardiac arrest. Mike was now the National Security Advisor. 'Even after two severe blows, ' 'Dr. Singh kept moving towards his target.' 'Nuclear Deal.' 'No one ever imagined that President Bush and Dr Singh would' 'become such thick friends.' 'After Dr Singh's return, there was a huge stir over the Nuclear dear.' With America. We're not making any secret deals. This is affecting our nation's... 'The Doctor was being attacked on three fronts.' 'Opposition, Left, and his own party.' The deal you're stressing on is beyond anyone's comprehension. But it will definitely cripple our government. The underprivileged people of our country have nothing to do with Nuclear energy. This is the right moment. We need nuclear energy for the development of our country. Think of the future. We can think of the future if our government still stays in power. Once you sign the deal, the Left Party will stop supporting us. Our time will be over. That won't happen. President Bush has assured to help me in every way. Oh, Doctor. And you believed a Politician. We'll talk another time. Goodbye. Bush arrived in Delhi. Both the Ministers shook hands announcing their nuclear deal to the world. And that I included my remarks, thank you. I have a pretty simple question. How will this deal affect our nuclear weapons? Sir, this will not affect our nuclear weapons. And we made that pretty clear in the beginning. We can make anything we want. Can this deal guarantee that the price of Uranium will decrease, and supply will increase? These debates will never end. But gentlemen, the entire country is proud of you. You're taking an important and crucial step. Sir... Mr Vajpayee, would you like to add something? Vajpayee sir was an expert in speaking volumes with his silence. Expert! He spoke volumes with just a smile. The BJP was now on our side. Indian Politics is a strange battle. The opposition became our allies. Our allies turned into Opposition. PM belonged to the party, but the party didn't seem to support the PM. Do you understand? Because, even after 20 years, I still didn't. Ram. Fantastic headlines, man, fantastic headlines. Baru, there is a problem. N. Ram. The Hindu Newspaper's Leftist Publisher and Editor. And a close friend of the Left leaders. N. Ram's green light meant Left leaders green light. Left won't support this deal. This... is a political decision. What will I tell the PM? To put the deal on hold. Otherwise, the Left will withdraw their support. If they want to withdraw their support, then they can do so. Sir, is this your official statement? Yes. These are the same people who opposed Mr Nehru and Indira Ma'am independent policy. They even opposed Mr Narsimha Rao and me. Whereas we were improving the country's economy. Prakash Karat states that the government is compromising the nuclear sovereignty of the country. I will sell out my country? How can they even say such a thing for me? Sir, what will be your next step, if they withdraw? We will put up a fight because the country comes first for me. 'Anguished PM To Left: If You Want To Withdraw, So Be It.' 'Dr. Singh didn't give up.' 'But, even the Left wasn't ready to give up easily.' 'People came out on the streets' 'and the Left walked out of the Parliament.' Madam, the Prime Minister made a strong statement against the Left party. Do you want an election before time? We don't want personal conflicts. These are not the morals of an Alliance. But madam, do you think that the Left is being unreasonable. I don't think so. The Left Party has certain ideologies and issues. They are simply putting forward their opinion. And you're happy with this? Of course. Yes, I'll escort you down. Welcome, Doctor. Your statement was a little out of character. Do you feel you've crossed the line? Is it working? Absolutely, loud and clear. Well, I was giving a reply to the Left. And, I don't think I crossed any line. Yes. I know what I should say or shouldn't. Sir, is the nuclear deal off? And if that's true, then what about your government. Well, we're not a one-issue government. One has to live with their disappoints. If this deal does not go through, then life won't come to an end. After this Doctor Sir observed silence. The entire country had only one question on their mind. Deal or no deal? Hello. Yes, sir. Right away. Yes, sir. Sorry. I didn't expect this from you, Sanjaya. What did I do? What did you tell the US Ambassador? About what, sir? About the Nuclear deal. What did you tell him? Ted, how are things at the Embassy? The Ambassador wants to know what the PM meant. What's there to add? Whatever he said is out there. What do I think the PM meant? Probably this, Ted. Que Sera Sera. What is the meaning of Que Sera Sera? Sir, I was not talking in code language. Your spies gave you wrong information. It's a song from one of Hitchcock's films. Man Who Knew Too Much. Sung by Doris Day. But what does it mean? Que Sera Sera means what will be will be. This is my standard answer to any question about the nuclear deal. I want to resign. Madam, my position has become pretty awkward. But must you give me this? Must you resign? Madam, the Left wants to see our government's secret documents. They want to embarrass us in the IAEA. If we compromise with the Left, then I'll no other option but to resign. But you do know that your resignation will create a stir. Madam, either we can ignore the Left and go ahead with the deal or compromise with the Left and stop the deal right here. If UPA chooses the second option, then you'll have to find yourself a new Prime Minister. Mr. Prime Minister, such decisions are not made in haste. Think about it. There was nothing to think actually. This Nuclear deal was bigger than the battle of Panipat for us. And the biggest blow came last night. At 10 Janpath. By the way, I should finish my coffee before Pulock arrives. Could be my last one at the PMO. May I come in, sir? Please come in. How are you, sir? Did Sonia ma'am send you here? Yes, sir. Sir, please take your resignation back. Sir, please. I've put my view in front of Sonia ma'am. There's no scope for reconsideration. Thank you. Sir, Sonia ma'am won't let you resign. You must stick to your statement. We'll see whatever happens to the Left. We'll see. Que Sera Sera. We sent a letter to the President today and withdrew our support from the UPA government. We've sent another letter where we've requested the President to direct the Prime Minister to bring the Confidence Motion in the Parliament and prove his government's majority. Sir, can I talk to you alone. Sir, Mr Amar Singh wants to talk to you. He's in the US. I think the deal will now go through, sir. No one knows about Science and Technology more than you. I want you to guide us. We want to take the right decision for the country. Is this deal right? Of course, it is. Your duty is to support the deal. It's in the interest of the country. That's all I wanted to hear from you. Now I can explain to my people. This is Politics. The entire country is praying for. Dr. Singh's good health and quick recovery. Will Dr Singh contest the elections from the Lok Sabha in such conditions? That's the question on everyone's mind. 'Dr. Singh had become a hero for the entire country.' 'But like every hero, even he had a weakness.' 'His own party.' 'And the party's biggest obstacle was me.' 'This happened in the earlier days.' How does it feel at the PMO? It's a challenging job, but I am enjoying it. But what went down with Mr Chandrashekhar? He seemed upset with you. After his meeting with the PM, he announced to Telugu media that they discussed over Telangana. Whereas no such thing ever happened. He never said a word to the PM about Telangana. Things are often misheard or said which leads to confusion. And, when you keep giving clarification for every trivial issue, it just adds to the confusion. There is no confusion. I know my job, and that's what I'm doing. Yes... some people will get angry. But what to do, Mr Patel. That's my job. But, we can't upset the party allies. Will you take my advice? Apologies to him. Or you might have to resign from your job. You don't have to worry about my job, Mr Patel. I work for the PM, and not the party. But the PM works for the party, Baru. I'll resign the day he tells me to. Right! Dr. Singh hardly says anything. During the Nuclear deal, a new PM candidate was being announced every day. This battle was now PM vs. Party. We were prepared. It is when I make sparrows fight hawks that I am called Gobind Singh. Sanjaya, I cannot work like this. The media announces a new PM every day. This news is very depressing, and the party doesn't deny them either. I was going to bring this up first thing tomorrow morning. Because I have a strategy. You cannot stop this news. But you can. Press Conference sounds very defensive. I was thinking of a political solution, These stories are being planted. There's nothing we can do about it. But maybe they've forgotten that you're not the PM of Congress. You're the PM of the entire UPA and their 11 Allies. And those Allies firmly believe in you. Neither you nor I am required to do or say anything. Sir, sir, sir... Sir, is the PM resigning. Is Rahul Gandhi the next PM of our country. What is Sonia Gandhi's next step? Tell us about your opinion. Please tell us, sir. It's all rumors. Manmohan Singh is the PM of UPA. And he enjoys the confidence of every party. Replacing him is out of the question. All the Allies are very happy with his work. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Congratulations, sir. Thank you. Sir, Rahul Gandhi is coming to meet you with the Youth Delegation. Did he take an appointment? No. Doesn't matter. Happy birthday, sir. Many many happy returns of the day. Happy birthday, sir. Baru. Baru. Please release this to the media. Rahul has requested the PM to increase the rates of 'MNREGA'. And the PM is pretty happy with it. What do you mean by 'PM is happy'? The PM supports the party's suggestion. Do you have a problem with it? The problem is... That sir has already made a public announcement about this on 15th August. And reporters hear all, write all, and they bloody well remember too. You're a wise man. I am sure you know that. So... Let me know if you need me for anything else. But... please keep this. Morning, Sir. Sanjaya, how can you do such a thing to me? MNREGA is my birthday present to the Country. You sent such a text, to the reporters. And to the Express. Was I wrong, Sir? Sir, how can they take credit? You're the PM of this country. What about the work done by ministers like Raghuvansh Prasad? I don't want any credit. I'm only concerned about my job. And your image. There's no need to keep my image straight. It is, sir. The world is watching you. If people can take credit for your work, then what else is safe in this country? Sanjaya, please don't be overly dramatic. Let them take all the credit. I am doing my job. You do yours. Write my speeches. Don't waste time over public positioning and public image. Thank you. Sorry, Sir. One more thing. Please come. Do you read the newspaper? Sorry, Sir. Stop worrying about the PMO's post, and worry about yours. It's in the newspaper again. Punjab Kesari. You're being fired from the PMO. That's 3-month-old news, sir. I think you should meet Madam once. Why Madam? You must tell her that wrong articles are being planted against you in the newspaper. And I will personally fix your appointment. I will think about it, Sir. Okay. Baru. Not now, Nair. I am busy. Just a minute. The MPs called, they were complaining about you. Did you give a quote to the newspaper? Do MPs call you as well? Yes, this is the PMO. Anyone can call here. You should meet Madam once. I'll fix an appointment. Sort out everything. You got to be a little flexible in politics. Blessings are important. Unfortunately, I am not a politician, but a bloody journalist. And they rate you for your stubbornness, not sycophancy. By the way, Nair, you were going down. I was going up. You should reconsider this once, Sanjaya. I can no longer play these political games. I want to resign. - Are you sure? - I am. Sir, the party won't let me do the job for which you have appointed me. And pardon me, but, you're least interested in your image as well. I will be known for my work, Sanjaya. What is the official reason you have mentioned in your resignation? Sir, Tanvi has been granted admission to the University of Singapore. And, I was thinking - I will take a job at the... - Don't go, Sanjaya. According to me, it is a foolish decision. I learnt it from you, Sir. Sometimes it is wise to be foolish. Will you write my speeches from Singapore? I'll do anything for you. One more thing... Give me a hug before you leave, boy. Take care. You're awake. How about some water? Can you pass my glasses? How are you, Sanjaya? How is Rama? They are all fine. What about your health? I didn't suffer a heart attack. It was just a preventive surgery. All my three arteries are fine. I am fighting fit. Sir, the elections are in three months. Your victory is guaranteed. And this time you'll contest the elections from the Lok Sabha. What is the party's opinion? Everyone knows the truth, Sir. This election is way out of Rahul Gandhi's league. The party is playing very safe. If you lose, it'll be your loss alone. But if you win, they all win. How is Singapore? Don't avoid the conversation. The entire country is a fan of you. If you contest from the Rajya Sabha again then your authority will be undermined. We'll do as the party says. You should focus on your health. Rahul will lead the election campaign. I cannot be just a spectator in this election. Sir, the party thinks that it could be risky if you lead the election campaign. We don't want to see you disappointed like Atalji after the elections. The party thinks I am going to lose this election. They don't have faith in me. Let's not worry about that now. Get some sleep. But... I won't give up. Wait and watch. The country has seen considerable development and surges in employment in the last five years and now we must take that program further. All we want is an opportunity in the Central government or the State government so that our party can set examples before the country about good governance. The effects of MNREGA can be clearly seen throughout the country. Due to our Economic planning, we were not affected by the Global Economic crisis. Thanks to Nuclear Deal India is now future ready. Our dreams of progress and change have come true. "Singh is King! Singh is King! Singh is King!" "The world knows about it. Singh is King! Singh is King!" "We are the king of the world! Singh is King Singh is King." This is Mr Manmohan Singh's victory. The slogan of Singh is King is resonating throughout the country. Congress party had no hopes of winning. Let alone winning by a landslide of 206 votes is on a completely different level. This is a huge opportunity for you. What is your opinion about the party's victory? Look... Listen here. Rahul Gandhi won 22 seats in UP and revived the Congress Party. This is a win for Rahul Gandhi. Get me Baru on the line, please. It's time for him to return. Welcome back. Nice to see you. I would like to promote you, Sanjaya. Would you like to be a Secretary in the PMO? Sir, it's an important position, but then I'll have to report to the Principal Secretary... And you want to report directly to me. I am meeting the Prime Minister of Pakistan in Egypt. I will clear your file when I come back. Do you have any idea about Pakistan? Sir, my advice is you shouldn't start your second term with Pakistan. The party will interfere. It's what happened during Musharraf's term? I think you should concentrate on the Global Economic crisis. India is not deeply affected by the Economic crisis, Sanjaya. I want to find a solution for Kashmir. And, maybe I don't have much time. What do you mean by you don't have much time? What could poor Dr Singh say? There was only one news doing rounds in the corridors of Delhi when will Dr. Singh step down and when will Rahul be coronated as the new PM. - Mr. Gilani. - Yes. Moments erred and years got punished. The people of India can never forget the 26/11 incident. President Zardari clearly said that the ISI chief will cooperate with us in the investigation. But he never came. Dr Singh, let's give a statement on terrorism and joint investigation. But... we have a small request just to make our army happy as well. Please go ahead. Baluchistan. But there's nothing in Baluchistan. We'll do it if you say so? The Opposition will raise a commotion. But it will be acceptable to the party. This is not acceptable to the party. Madam Chairperson, Baluchistan is not an issue at all. But you just made it an issue. And an international one at that. All the senior ministers are of the opinion that it was a big mistake. But we can still change the wordings of the agreement, madam. Maybe you didn't understand my words properly. If you... Yeah... how are things? Yes, the PM did call me, and we even talked. But who told you that I would look after the UPA programs in the PMO? If Chauhan said this, then he must have done so with the PM's consent. But I cannot confirm or deny this. Your decision. Wars are never won with wooden swords, Baru. You are unable to tackle the handle of a cycle, how will you manage the media? Did you see today's Business Standard? Stop lecturing me. You've been appointed to do your job, and not talk. Don't repeat this mistake. Now hang up. Sir, it was you who called me back. Things have gone awfully wrong after this news was leaked in the media. But the news was leaked from this office. There's no point arguing over it now. Sir, this is your opportunity to show your authority. This is your victory. The PMO is your turf! - How can you... - Sanjaya! Politics has taught me one thing, and you should know too. There's only one power centre. And that centre is the Party President. What do you expect me to do now? Join the Planning Commission I'll call you back when things cool down again. Sir, I had no interest in a government job. I only wanted to work for you. I have an offer from Business Standard as their Editor. That's even better than the Planning Commission. Journalism suits you better. Nair, come in. Thank you, sir. What a weak man. A scandal that rocked the whole nation. Tape Scandal. Conversations of Politicians, Journalists and Power Brokers was out in the open. How do they appoint the ministers? Everyone could hear who the reporters actually served. Almost everyone was exposed. After the Nira Radia tapes, the country has lent their support with the Anna Hazare's campaign against the 2G, 3G, and Coalgate scams. And the Anna Campaign has become the voice of the country. UPA Government may sound dismissive about the Anna Panels Lokpal Bill. But team Anna is warning the government that it will have to confront the Electorate. If the PM is found involved in such corruption, then that's very shameful. The people always see how our leader functions, how he behaves. Be seated. Would you like some tea? No, thank you. So Dr. Singh, tell me. Madam, I cannot continue in this way. But Dr. Singh, with the steep rise in inflation, and the number of corruption scams being exposed the media is completely against us. How can Rahul take over in a situation like this? But Madam, you must find a way. This is not the time for a change. But I have to own up to mistakes committed by others. How will I explain this to the people? That's not your job. The party has many competent people to explain the people in the right away. But Madam, I think... Are you sure you don't want a cup of tea? Look, there are two kinds of loss. Actual and Notional. The actual loss is a real loss. And a notional loss is just notional. CAG's estimate in the 2G spectrum scam is just a notional loss. Understand. Sir, sir, sir... - Sir, sir... - One question, sir! Sir, please! You mean to say, Sir, that the Controller Auditor General is wrong. All I am saying is that there have been no losses. Unbelievable, Mr. you just turned around the entire mathematics. You turned a loss of 17.6 billion to Zero. - Sir... - Yes. What does your mathematics say about the coal scam? Well... what loss? When there has been no digging, and no coal retrieved then how can there be losses? Understand. Sir. Sir... Sir. Sir... Sir, this time you turned 18.6 billion into Zero. Things got worse in a year. Dr. Singh was being openly mocked. Jokes about him were posted over the internet. 2G, CWG and Rahulji... were more than a match for Dr Singh. And he was completely silent about it. And during those days weird things started happening with me. Excuse me, Mr. Baru. Advisor to the Prime Minister. Former Advisor. What is going on, sir? Why doesn't Mr Manmohan Singh do something? Or say something? - Excuse me, Mr. Baru. - Yes. My daughter's a journalist too. Big fan. By the way, I have a question. Why did you quit the PMO? Come on, tell us. I won't tell anyone. I find Dr Singh is like Bhism. With no evil. But a victim of family drama. Sir, there were two families in Mahabharata, but there's only one in India. Sir, sir, sir... Just a second. Just a second. Let me go there. There's been a lot of debate over this ordinance. About what should be done about this order from Supreme Court? I can't speak for others, but what I feel should be done with this ordinance. This. This is what needs to be done. Tear it up. This ordinance is nonsense. The UPA government was badly cornered for trying to save the ordinance. The Opposition parties were first opposing this ordinance, and now even Rahul Gandhi has taken a stand against it. Rahul first gave a strong statement and then called this ordinance utter nonsense and wrote a letter to the Prime Minister asking for a reconsideration. 'After Rahul's statement, the PM talked about it to Sonia Gandhi.' We're talking to ex-media advisor of PM, Mr Sanjaya Baru. Sir, what is your opinion on Rahul's action. 'The PM wants to resign, says Baru.' Look, if his own party people can't respect him then I believe that Dr Singh should tender his resignation. Papa, Mr. Baru is right. What is the point now? How much more is the Party going to humiliate you. Why don't you say something? Sir, there's something I wanted to tell you. It's time to jot down whatever I saw, heard, and understood during my term in the PMO. Will you write about me too? Sir, writing the truth is very crucial for the course of history. You're a genius, And it really pains me when people laugh at you. I will write what I saw. About me too? I will do it sincerely. Even the bitter truth? That too. Maybe just that one. Sir, I don't know all the aspects of the truth. In fact, I don't know how many aspects are there. Except for yours and mine. I'll write our truth. Will you write about this meeting as well. Come. I miss you, Sanjaya. I have a job for you, which only you can do. Tell me, sir. My last press conference is on the 3rd of January. What should I say to the nation? What about your speechwriters, sir? I wouldn't tell you if it was their cup of tea. You must be my voice for one last time. PM sir, you must be very aggressive. Elections are around the corner, and the press would want to corner you. You must deflect all the attacks on Rahul. That I cannot do. I am there, sir. I'll write your speech. You will understand everything. The party wants to make Dr Singh a liability. And, I will never let that happen. I don't want a third term. In a few months time, after the general elections. I will hand over this post to the new Prime Minister. I hope he will be a Pm chosen by the UPA and our party will keep working in that direction. I firmly believe, that our new generation leader will take this country ahead. Sir, is this a goodbye? Sir, you never said anything against any corruption scandal. Would you like to comment on it? What is your opinion? Will Rahul Gandhi be the next PM candidate? Have you been made a sacrificial lamb? I am sure that history won't look at me from the media's point of view. India doesn't need one watchman to stand guard. India needs millions of guards. A few days ago Prince Charming was here. These days he keeps thinking about me, day and night. The elections are for India, and he's holding me accountable for Gujarat. You people did nothing, but I will. I will give you power. I will give you knowledge. 'Long live...' The government run by Mom Son duo is virtually out. Even the jailbirds can't save Congress. I request you to stay for 10 more minutes. Please hear what Rahul has to say. Can you take back this election, or you have already lost it before it begun. Because most of the survey are saying... Congress will be reduced to its lowest ever tally. What have you written? - Did you read it? - Not yet. Dr Singh has been reading every single line since morning. What did you write? Did he say anything? Is he happy? Seems like it. Come and meet him. I am boarding my flight now. I'll call as soon as I land. 'Just like Bheeshm, Dr Singh too committed the same mistake.' 'He too put the family first' 'He took a step back so that Rahul could move ahead.' 'The family was more important to him than the party.' 'Maybe that was his biggest mistake.' Does Dr Singh know that I want to talk to him... That Sanjaya Baru wants to talk to him? Boss, are you sure, because... PMO will give its reply tomorrow. What? Hello. Hello. Baru, bad news. The book sales are down. I thought if we release it during the elections, it will attract good sales. But I think my plan doesn't seem to be working. Hello. What's wrong? Where are you lost? It's been three days, and Dr Singh hasn't called back yet. Sanjaya Baru's book, The Accidental Prime Minister was written for personal interest. We completely deny all its facts. It harms the respect of a responsible post. Sanjaya Baru has betrayed the PMO by writing this book. Congrats, Mr Baru. The PMO has done your job for you. Book sales are an all-time high. Now start writing your next book pretty soon. So what if I get a bad name, at least I'll get a name... Mr Patel. Dr. Singh. Dr. Singh. Sir! We never met again. I still wonder how accurate he found my truth to be. Maybe I will get my answer. Maybe not. But I will never regain what I lost in Dr Singh. "The word 'Aum' is nothing but a misconception."
