(ominous music) (plain swooshes) (train honks) (peaceful piano music) (Kelly moans) (alarm beeps) - Damn it! (upbeat music) Well, it's another day, and another opportunity to find true love. I told myself that this is the year that I'm gonna find the man of my dreams. I know it's already August, but I'm not giving up. I'm on this new dating app called Hitched Date. It's for young professionals who are looking for the real thing. I know you must think this is pathetic. Let's face it, this is how it's done. - Oh, I heard you were looking for Florida, baby. You found it. - Your butt could be like around ball, like a planet. - You see me finger a a g-string, and after the show they might let me finger their g-string. - And I am like a satellite, I orbit. - I have been looking for the perfect woman to marry. - More of a chew and screw type of guy if I say so myself. - And I have a house with an empty room. - I don't think I can conflab with a woman that don't know who Billy D is. - I know, don't get intimidated. (George laughs) - Sorry. (upbeat music) (camera shutters) This is where I work. I'm a Project Manager for a major design-build firm, which is a bit strange 'cause I went to school for computer science. However, I am really organized, so they brought me on board. - Oh, Kelly darling, this scarf is so tired. It's about ready to take a nap. - You don't like my scarf? - No, dear, no one wears a scarf in August. - Don't pay attention to him. I know it's a Saturday, but we have a huge presentation on Monday, and even though we're all required to be here today, my boss is really awesome, and she loves me. - Kelly? Where is Kelly? Ah, Kelly, do you have the numbers? Okay, good girl. - Ooh, bosslady, you are rocking that scarf, darling. Here's your coffee, sweetheart. - Thank you, Jonathan. - Will there be anything else? - Maybe you can get your nose out of my ass. - Ooh, apparently, it's not big enough. - These look good. These look really, really good. (phone rings) (upbeat music) No, I have them in front of me. - Good morning. - Good morning. That's Jessica. She's my best friend. I love working with her. Back to finding true love. He's tall, dark, and handsome. He plays football. Has such a great body. He's everything that I can dream up in a guy, and he loves me. (upbeat music) Ew, get her out of there. (Vanessa screams) Ah, that's better. (upbeat music) (music scratches) Don't misunderstand me or anything. He's not my boyfriend. You might even be wondering what's his real. Well, he is. (suspenseful piano music) I see him in the park sometimes. I really wish he would notice me, but the timing has just been all wrong. Well, bad timing can be an understatement, but I'm sure once he notices me, sparks will fly. (suspenseful xylophone music) - Hold on one second. - What? - (groans) I hate cardio. Oh yeah, my bad. I was just up late last night. Have you thought of an approach at all for this presentation? - Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm going to use cross matrix filter. You know it's gonna analyze, spending an internet based search patterns. - So essentially you're just taking a snapshot of these companies spending reports and earnings. - Exactly. - Great. - Yeah, we're gonna see which companies are cutting spending and one that's laying off workers. Take that data, put it through my algorithm, cross reference it with all their physical locations, find out the weakest locations, and boom, we got our targets. - So essentially you're just gonna hack into a multi-million dollar companies database. You do realize you're gonna have to be the one to sell this to Jack and Michael, right? You know how anal he can be. - [Dillan] We're not hacking it to anything. It's our data. (tense music) - Hopefully, it doesn't bite us both in the ass. (phone chimes) Give me a sec. - Holy shit, are you on Hitched? I didn't even know you had one of those. - Yeah, I dabble in it. - Hey, I mean does it, you know, work for you? I mean, I personally have just never had any luck. Mm. Mm. Mm-mh. - No, let me just, you know, 'cause I like, let me- - Kyle? (phone chimes) Kyle, what the fuck? - What? (phone chimes) - You just made me like this girl. - Shut the front door. - She's not that bad. - Not that bad? - Hey girl, come on, let's go. The meeting's about to start. - Look! - What? - (gasps) Damn, he's fine. - Not bad? This girl is a fucking scab. - Wait, he liked you. - Hey. (chuckles) - You should just bang and deny, bang and deny, you know. - Damn, he's fine. - Get your whistle on it. - What? - Wait, what are you gonna say? - Just hit it and quit it. Bang, bang, bang. - (laughs) So lame. Yo, what's up? - I don't know. (both laughing) - Oh, okay, well, since you're such a stud, why don't you bang her then? - I ain’t like her. (chuckles) - You know what, Kyle? Thank you so much for showing such genuine concern. I really appreciate it. - Oh God! - Asshole. (suspenseful music) - Hi team. Okay, I am happy to announce that we have made it to the next step in landing the redesign for the Gateway Mall. - (sighs) I wish I wasn't in this stupid meeting. Oh, my God, he is so hot. I wonder what he's doing right now. - All right, so I wanna thank Kelly for all the hard work. Kelly? Kelly! - What? I am so sorry. - Pathetic. - I'm sorry, are you busy? - No, continue. Okay, I feel like an idiot. My boss is giving me props, and I am totally ignoring her. But what the hell? This could be it. (laughs) She's such a perv. I swear she should have been a pornstar. I wonder where he lives. I wonder how he likes it. (sensual guitar music) (Kelly moans) (moans) Dillan. (moans) Yeah. (upbeat music) Oh, my God. (moans) Yes. Yes. (moans) - Kelly? - What? I am so sorry. (suspenseful music) - One more time, and I'm taking a hammer to that fucking phone. - It won't happen again, I'm sorry. - It better not. Okay, as I was saying, - I am not risking true love for a stupid meeting. Hmm, no response yet. I wonder why he hasn't responded. He must be busy. Yeah, he's busy. ♪ If you're thinking of going down, down ♪ ♪ Even ♪ Even - Oh my God, I thought Alexis was gonna lose her shit today. - He hasn't responded yet. - Who? - Should I send them another message? - That guy? Oh, that fine guy from Hitched. Wait, did you steal his photo and make it your wallpaper? - Yes. So what? I like his photo and his name is Dillan. I'm gonna message him one more time. - Oh my God, he was here. He was here! - Calm down, what are you talking about? - It was him. He was here. The app has this feature that allows you to see if other people who use the app are around. - (chuckles) That's just fucking creepy. Oh my God, don't look, Jonathan just walked in. - Ah, fuck, he's such a pain in the ass. - Maybe he won't see us. - Hello ladies. - Hi Jonathan. - What, no boys tonight, or is it just a cunninlingus type night? - What do you want, Jonathan? - I just stopped by to say hello. Oh please, dear, Hitched? - What? - I can't believe you're on Hitched. - What? - That's like catfish city. voted the number one dating site by the douchebag tribune. No fatties or fuglies here. Stop pretending that you're looking for love, and finally upgrade your social status. Let's face it, what you really want is to date someone who's better than you. - I never thought I would find true love. The kind of love that's based purely on looks and money. Then I tried the Hitched app, and I met the most shallow man of my dreams. - Oh, thank you baby. You know, I found exactly what I was looking for. I was just looking for for a desperate girl who's insecure with a hot body, but thinks she's ugly, who will let me do freaky shit on her. (laughs) we know what you're really looking for. - Johnathan, don't be such a bitch. Don't be such a bitch. Don't be such a bitch. - For your information, I am talking to a really hot guy who could be the man of my dreams. - Well, not exactly talking. - Yeah, well, your dreams and his nightmare, sweetheart. I'll see your work tomorrow, ladies. Ta at! - Ignore him. - What a fucking asshole. Asshole! (upbeat music) Anyway, do you realize that we could have walked right past him? - Girl, I hope you're not gonna obsess over this guy. - You know what this means, right? What, what means? - It's a sign? - No, it's not. - It's definitely a sign. I'm gonna message him again. Hey there, I see we've crossed paths. Winky face. - Are you freaking crazy? - What? - Kelly, what are you doing? Are you just gonna bang him? - I didn't mean like a hook up. (both laughing) - Okay, seriously though, what if he some kind of serial killer? - Or what if he is the one? - Did he respond? (upbeat music) - Not yet. - I gotta go. Be careful. You know how I feel about all this online dating stuff, especially now, since you stalkers can track each other, I'm serious, don't do anything stupid, and don't message him again. Let him message you. (suspenseful music) (people chattering) (tense cymbal music) (peaceful piano music) - This is Sam and Pam. They're such an item. I feed them at least three times a week. They come to my door and look at me through the glass. It is the cutest thing ever. Sam always follows Pam. No matter where I see them, they're always together. Isn't that the way it's supposed to be? I love their little love affair. It gives me such hope. God, I hope to have found my Sam. Only my Sam's name is Dillan. (suspenseful upbeat music) - Hold up a minute, Michael, I've been trying to talk to you about this the whole day. - Watch out. - Hello Jack. - It's in the contract. - No, you have to look at this though. - If you can't read the contract, tell him to have his lawyer read the contract to help him figure it out. - It's got kelvin all over it. (upbeat music) - Hey, Dillan, how's the program development coming? - We're in the middle of beta testing now, sir. - So what does that mean? - Two, three weeks tops. - That's my man. You know what happens if you pull this off, right? No more sitting at the kids' table. You know what happens if you don't? - Yes, sir. - You see that man? Make him proud. (guitar music) - Jesus Christ, turn that thing down. I said turn it down! Oh shit! The whole fucking neighborhood can hear you. What are you doing? - Dad? (sighs) I didn't know you were home. - Son, why are you wasting your time with this nonsense? - It's not nonsense, dad, I'm rehearsing. - It's nonsense. You'll never become anything if you keep wasting your time with this crap. - It's not nonsense, dad, I'm rehearsing. - Oh, it's nonsense. I don't wanna hear it. - Dad. - Is a too much for a father to ask to want his son to make him proud? Oh! (suspenseful piano music) (bouncy music) - Hi. - Hi. - Well, I'm here. What are your other two wishes? - One that you would go away. - And two that you never come back. - So what's your name? - Valeria. - Valeria, wow! That's very, very beautiful. You know, it sounds like malaria. - Right. - Yeah, you know, because you're just so infectiously good looking. - Good one. - So what's your name? - Sophia. - Sophia, wow! Yeah, you know, beautiful name and eyes to match. You're quite a catch. - Okay, is there anything we could actually help you with? - Yeah, actually you can help me find dinner reservations for three. - Seriously? - Yeah, you know? I know this great restaurant by the water and some wine. - Fuck off. - Okay, okay, I can just see this as a bad time. I'll come right back. (phone rings) (Michael knocks) - Come in. - You finish those reports? - Yeah, of course. Hey Michael, you got a sec? - Sure, what's on your mind? - Well, this is gonna sound kind of stupid, but Jack just popped his head in here. Honestly, I don't know whether to feel encouraged or threatened. - Kid's table? - Yes. What is with all this kid's table shit? - When I started here, I was working for your father. Jack was his number two. I wanted to make a name for myself. My first big project, we were traveling the globe searching for land, properties. Of course, that was for the internet. Anyway, Chuck used to come up to my desk all the time, driving me freaking nuts, pressuring me, making strange comments. And right before my big promotion, he dropped the kids table thing on me. I think it's just Jack's way of saying, "It's time to move up," or maybe he was speaking for Tom. (somber piano music) - Yeah, it's just weird, you know? - What's weird is that Jack isn't that much older than me? I don't know why he goes around spouting those old euphemisms. I don't know, maybe he got it from his old man. I don't know what it is you're working on, but according to Jack, it could change the whole goddamn industry. You don't understand, I've known Jack a long time, and he never says shit like that. The point is you pull this off, I guarantee you're gonna be moving up. - Good, 'cause I'm tired of everyone thinking that I'm only here because of my father. - Listen to me, you are the only person here who thinks that. Your father busted his ass to build this business and make it what it is. People think that he took chances, risks, but Tom had his shit dialed in. He called it focus. Tom believed that if you focused on what you want, you can make your own reality. So the only thing, the only thing you should be thinking about is do you wanna focus on whether you belong here, or do you wanna focus on owning this whole goddamn thing? (piano music) - Michael? - Thank you. (door closes) - Okay. - Jesus Christ. - What? - Knock much? - Oh, come on. Look, let's go get some drinks after work. You seem very, very stressed. What? Come on, look, I just played probably one of the most legendary seeds of all time with the girl at the front desk. Her name's Valeria by the way, and we all can go visit Vanessa. ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ Oh (upbeat music) - Shut up. - What? Oh, come on, how long has it been that you two have known each other. - Dude, she was my babysitter. - Dillan, can you please, pick up your toys. - No. - Pick up your toys now. - No. - Are you kidding me? Come on, mihi, help me. Serious. - Why do I always have to do it? - I can't believe this. (suspenseful music) - Well, life has now come full circle, and it is time for you to have that Latin baby, sit on your face. (cheerful Latino music) - All right, dude, enough about Vanessa, okay, please. It's never gonna happen. She doesn't see me that way, and besides she's like 10 years older than me. - Are you kidding me? Have you not seen the way this woman looks at you? Oh, papi. Oh Dillan. Dude, I'd be like bang, bang, bang, slap in the ass in that Latin MILF. 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365, Dillan. - Okay, Kyle, please, please. Okay, listen, Jack just peeked his head in. Michael stopped by. I just, I don't have it. Okay, I don't have the mental capacity to deal with this right now, okay? I'm sorry, man. - Oh, Jesus Christ, please, don't tell me he did the kids' table thing to you again. - Yes, the kids' table. It's always that. What is with that shit? - Look, I don't know. Well, come on, he does the kids table one thing to me too. I just, you know, ignore it. - Yeah, well, Michael says it's Jack's way of saying, "You're moving up." - So just do what I do, and focus on your work. (chuckles) - Focus on your work? The only thing you focus on is banging chicks. - There is nothing more satisfying than cracking the intricate and complex code of the female species. - Will you shut the fuck up. - What? It's true. Listen to me, there is scientific studies that says that women's breasts reduce man's brain power by about 50% per boob. (suspenseful music) - Yeah, I see your point. - Of course you do. (suspenseful music) (keyboard clanking) (phone chimes) - Ew, oh my God, no. (toilet flashes) Wait, what the. You fucking blocked me? (somber music) Why? (sobs) why did you block me? (somber music) (Kelly sobs) So I had a moment of weakness, and I was hoping that this was the real thing, but fuck him! I wouldn't even respond if he messaged me right now. Oh, shit, is that him? Oh, my God. Is he really waving at me? - Hey! - I knew this was meant to be. - Dillan? Oops, sorry. - What the hell? - Look at you sexy. Look at you sexy. - Hey, what's up, girl? - Seriously? Who's this hooker with her up in the air. Oh my God. (somber piano music) Oh my God. (somber piano music) (tense piano music) Fine, he didn't like my old profile, well, maybe he'll like my new one. I am not giving up that easily. (cat meows) Now, I just gotta find this asshole. (keyboard clanking) There. (suspenseful music) Hi, there, cutie. (scoffs) There, let's see if he responds. (suspenseful piano music) (upbeat music) You must be thinking it's awful of me to catfish him. I know I'm tricking him, but what am I supposed to do? I know if he just gave me a chance, and got to know me, we would be the perfect match, so I am going to make him get to know me, but first I gotta make a few changes. I know what I'm going to do.

A little Hitched alert. - Okay, give me that. - Relax, I just wanna see. Dude, she's hot. This is so unfair. All I ever get is gays, grandmas, and grandes. - Are you done? - I mean, you know, I'm being honest. She kind of looks like Vanessa. - What? She so does not. I don't even know why you'd say something like that. - Hey baby, wanna chat? - Dude what are you doing? - I'm not doing anything. Relax. Oh, tell me a little bit about yourself, baby? - All right, Kyle, give me the phone back. - All, right, take it. - Now. - Take it. - Jesus, man. - Have you ever hooked up with any of these girls? All right, well, just let me see it. Let me see. Come on, I'm not gonna do anything. I just wanna see the pictures. Pictures are worth a thousand words. - Fine. (bouncy music) Don't message her. - I won't. (bouncy music) God! How did you get this lucky? All right, you need to bang this girl. - Oh, I got it. - Like tomorrow. - Oh, yeah. - Today if you can. - Sure. - And you will thank me. - Kyle, what did we say? - You didn't say anything. - What did we say? - I'm saying you're gonna be laid. - What did we say? - I work at Lang Holding. - I said not to touch it, right? Kyle? - You need to touch this. - I told you not to touch the phone, didn't I. - This is like one time at summer camp when I told you to kiss that girl behind the bleachers and you pussied out. - You don't listen. - This is not happening again. I'm telling you don't listen to this. - [Dillan] That's your problem. - I'm going to set us up with a supermodel, - Dude, I am not fucking with you right now. - You are going to have sex with a supermodel tonight. - Kyle, give me my phone! - All right, fine, take it, take it, take it, take it. (suspenseful music) - You told her where I work. Are you crazy? I don't know this person. She could be a serial killer. - Or worse. I mean, she could be a he. (upbeat music) You'll thank you later.

Anyway, I matched with this guy. He looked tall in his photos, and I'm a tall girl, so I figured I'd give it a shot. He pulls up and he’s short as fuck, okay? You can't, how do you go from six foot to midget that I don't fucking understand. We started dancing. He's getting a little spicy, and he asked me to come home with him. "Hey, mommy, come back to my place." He makes me pay for my own drink. I just fucking met you, you think I'm gonna have sex with you right now? This is like my first time fucking meeting you. Anyway, after that, that was pretty much my last time on this fucking dating app. I'm over it. It's bullshit. (upbeat music) - Line them up, Vanessa. - I needed this. - It has been a long week. - On the house guys. - Cheers. - Cheers. - So what are you guys doing tonight? - Well, I am looking for just about any woman that will have me. This guy on the other hand is bouncing around like a 12 year old who just had his first wet dream. - Dude, fuck you. - Really? - Oh, come on. Look, he's going steady with his cell phone. - It's not true. - Yeah, it is true. - Yes, it is true. I believe you. - Oh, great, well, you should believe this. That's over there is my cue, so. - Go get 'em tiger. - Oh, I will. - Good luck. - I mean, totally false. - Yeah, right. I know you. So what's up with this puta on your phone? - Oh really? - Yes, really? - What are you jealous? - Well, I'm curious. Tell me everything I wanna know. - No, it's not much to tell. I mean, I met this girl on Hitched. We hit it off, and I don't know, things have been going really great. - Let me see. Let me see. - So you guys are Russian? Yeah? Yeah, that's awesome, you know, I took Russian in high school for like two semesters, you know, I got the whole thing going on. - Let me see. Come on. I wanna see. - Okay, all right. - Oh wow. She's pretty. - I know right? - What's her name? - Kelly. - Kelly? Well, she doesn't look like a Kelly. - Okay, whatever. - Those drinks are pretty good, right? They're pretty expensive. If you ask me they're they're an aged vodka. (woman speaks in foreign language) - Oh my God, she just texted you. - Okay, can I have that back, please? - I'm gonna make you smile. - Vanessa? - So freaking lame. - Vanessa, please. - Are you guys moving in together or what? - Oh my God, enough. (woman speaks in foreign language) - So I was wondering, do you guys want to maybe. (woman speaks in foreign language) What? - Okay, gosh, Jesus. - A little privacy. - You smiled, but that's a first for you tonight. - It looks like Kyle found what he's looking for. - I was thinking maybe we could leave here, and maybe go back to my place, or somewhere quiet. - Yeah, sure after we finish our drinks. - English. (woman speaks in foreign language) - Maybe not. - Hey, what did I say? - Ouch! - And what are you looking for, Mr. Dillan? - I think you know the answer to that. (Vanessa sighs) (upbeat music) - Didn't wanna go to Russia anyway. I like Cubans better. (upbeat music) (cheerful rock music) ♪ I came tonight ♪ To put my problems off to the side ♪ ♪ Let the music take me to (phone rings) - Dillan? - Kelly? Hi. - Hi. - It's nice to finally hear your voice. - It's nice to finally hear your voice too. So tell me about yourself. - Well, what do you wanna know? What do you do at Lang? - Actually, I'm a programmer. - Really? What are you working on? - Well, it's kinda dorky stuff, but I'm working on an algorithm that accurately predicts foreclosures before they happen. - That's interesting. You must be running for proprietary banking information through a cross matrix filter that analyzes spending and internet search patterns. Let me guess, you're using a multi-head hydro for the banking data, and a math-based filter to limit the search patterns. - Wow! (chuckles) Yes, that's like exactly what I'm doing. Are you a programmer? - I code a little. - So on top of being incredibly smart, you're also extremely beautiful. So what do you do for work? - I manage logistics for a design-build firm. - Sounds pretty cool. - Not as cool as what you're doing. - Yeah, it's just, my boss sucks, and ever since my parents passed away, this guy has been in charge of my dad's company. - Yeah, that does suck. - Yeah, you know, my father used to always say that I needed to earn my place in this world. (chuckles) That was actually the last thing he said to me before he died. - Dad. - Yes, Dillan. - So I wrote a couple songs, and I wanted to record a demo, but before you say no, just hear me out. - Sit down. (seagulls calling) Son, what did I say about the music? It is a waste of time. - It's not a waste of time. God, why can't you just take a minute to see that I want a life in music. - What are you gonna do for a living? You think you're gonna live here your whole life, playing that stupid guitar. It's not happening. - It's not stupid, and I'll get a job. - (chuckles) A job. - Yeah, a job. - Doing what? - I don't know, I'll figure it out. - Dillan, I've seen it a thousand times, young people with promise and opportunity pissing away on some pipe dream, and they find themselves in a real pickle later in life. They are no longer young. No longer viable. No longer good looking. Life has passed them by, and they haven't earned a goddamn nickel. You find these losers in bars talking about how they almost made it. Blaming the world for their problems, meanwhile, they can't afford their fucking bar tab. Son, you are better than that, you're a Lang. You have to earn your place in the world, and the music business, it's just not going to do it. - Wow, that sucks. I'm so sorry, Dillan. But hey, you always have your music, and you never have to give that up. (upbeat music) Besides when you finish this project, you are gonna make your father proud. - Yeah, I think you're right. - I just wish he'd be here to see it. - Oh, he will. (upbeat music) - Wow, what are you doing? - What do you think I'm doing? (upbeat music) - Are you? - Do you wanna fuck me, Dillan? (Kelly sighs) (Kelly moans) - Yes. - (moans) Do you wanna fuck me, Dillan? - Yes, I really do. (Kelly moans) - I needed that. - When can I see you? - Soon. Good luck tomorrow. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. (suspenseful music) Kelly, Kelly? Hello? (suspenseful music) Holy shit! - I don't wanna take the show away from, Dillan. He's been working on this presentation. - This is Tom's boy, right? - That's correct. - Did we really put some serious thought about that? Are we gaining, losing? - Ready pal? Relax, you're gonna do fine. What's the worst that could happen? - Yeah. Yeah, let's do this. - You all know Dillan, Tom's son. He's been working on something that's very exciting to say the least. So Dillan, this is your show, why don't you tell us what you got? - Okay, thank you for having me here. Up until today, finding new and viable real investments have generally been network-based, either you have inside information on a property, or company that's in trouble ahead of time, or you find out after it's been made public. Now obviously, the key in this business is to be first, I've come up with an algorithm based on the company's existing proprietary data that can predict which commercial businesses are likely to foreclose even before the owners have any idea they're in hot water. Now, as you can see, this gives us an unprecedented advantage. We could literally be first at every single, distressed, commercial real estate opportunity before anyone even knows that the company is in any trouble. - We can even help some of the more interesting properties, you know, a little push over the cliff, - Christ, Jack. - Goddamn it! - To make money. I mean, better in our bank than theirs, and Dillan, the software works, right? - Well, with my limited ability to test, yes, it does. However, in order to fully test its capabilities, I will need to load the software into our mainframe, so that I can fully integrate it with our financial and holding data. - And Kyle, this software, it's secure, and I mean, it's unbreachable? - This software, I've run it through countless tests. It's bulletproof. In fact, I'll go as far as to say that it's genius. - "It's genius," he says. - Shit, it better be, or you guys are gonna be sucking soup on a bread line somewhere. - What he's trying to express is that you better have your shit dialed in before you pull the trigger. - I have a call with Istanbul within 15 minutes. Can we vote already, please? - So I guess we're ready to vote. All in favor? - [All] Aye. - Okay, well, that's it, meeting adjourn. Hey Dillan, just a minute. - Yes, sir. - I just wanna say you did a great job in there. - Ah, thank you, sir. - If you pull us off, our next conversation is gonna be about your future. - Ah, Jack, thanks again, sir. I won't let you down. - I know you won't, son. I'm counting on you. - I can't believe you just did that. You do realize how crazy that presentation was, right? - Dude, I don't know what came over me. I was just on a roll. - I'll tell you what came over you. Legendary stuff, okay? You do realize like that's it. We just have one more step. - I know, man, but you saw Michael in there. I mean, that was a pretty intense warning. - (blows raspberries) Don't worry about Michael, okay? He's just a business guy. He's trying to get inside your head. - Wise words, man. - You know it. - Dude, thank you brother. You know I wouldn't have been able to do this without you. - Probably, yeah. (Kyle laughs) - So... see you at the park tomorrow? - See you at the park tomorrow. - Yeah, you are. - All right, man later. (peaceful piano music) (phone dials) - Hey. - Hey. - How'd it go? - Crushed it. - I assume you killed it. - Yeah, yeah, I just got out. So what are you up to? - Nothing much, I'm just at my best to Jessica's house. You know? Just relaxing. - So listen, I was thinking, you know, we should meet. - Meet, like a date? - Yes, meet, like in real life. I don't know, what do you think about Stash tomorrow six o'clock? - Yeah, I lost Stash. I love that place. - All right, it's a date. I'll text you later to confirm. Okay? - Great, I can't wait. - Yeah, I gotta go. Bye. - Bye. - Oh, my God. ♪ I wanna be in ♪ I knew from the start ♪ I would get in over my head ♪ Your playful heart - I know what you're thinking, how could I possibly meet him? Especially when he thinks he's been talking to miss model these past two weeks. I would be lying if I said I wasn't terrified, but I think this is fate. Besides, when he meets me, none of this is gonna matter anymore. He's gonna to fall in love with me, the real me, and that's what really counts. Time to set a date. ♪ But it's okay Hi there, tomorrow works perfect. (suspenseful piano music) Now we just have to wait for him to respond. I can't wait. I can't wait to finally meet him in person. Everything is just gonna be so perfect, like a fairy tale, just like Pam and Sam. I hope he likes what I've done with my hair, and I hope he likes my boobs. I mean, they're kind of small, but they fit in the hands, so I'm sure he'll be okay with that. He's just gonna love everything about me, just like I love everything him. And we're just gonna live forever in happiness. Why the fuck hasn't he responded yet? What the fuck? (sighs) What if he doesn't respond? Is he ghosting me? Or what if he does respond, and then he stands me up? Oh my God, he totally thinks I'm pathetic! Why the fuck hasn't he responded yet? (screams) Fuck you, fuck! What the fuck are you looking at? What the fuck are you looking at? (ominous music) God, why am I so different? He's never gonna wanna be with me forever? It's not gonna be a fairy tale ending? (phone buzzes) Oh my God, he responded. Oh my God. Oh my God! Oh my God! I have to call Jessica. (phone rings) Hey girl, what's up? - (screams) Oh my God, oh my God! - Okay, wait, calm down. I can't understand you. What are you talking about? - Oh, I'm going on a date with the guy? The guy from Hitched. - Wait really? Oh, I was totally wondering what happened to him. We've been talking, and messaging. - And you've been keeping all this from me. - Well, I didn't want you to think I was obsessing over him, especially after you made that comment about him being my wallpaper. - Oh gosh, I'm so proud of you. I'm so happy for you. Look, I love you. I wanna hear everything, okay? But Alexis has to be going to the Caymans, and I've got to go to catch my flight. - I'll totally call you after the date tomorrow, and let you know how everything went. (plane engine roaring) (upbeat music) - What's up, my man, what brings you in tonight? - Hey, how are you, boss? - Good, good. - Good, man, today is a good day. - Let's hear it. - I just got this awesome girl coming in here today. I mean, we're meeting for the first time, but she's smart. She's beautiful. I mean, she's everything, man. I mean, it's the first date, but I don't wanna speak too soon or anything, but it really feels like, you know, this could be it. Yo, check her out. - That's what I'm talking about. - Right. - Good luck, man. It's a winner. - Thank you. (upbeat music) (satirical romance music) (record rewinds) (upbeat music) - Hi. - Oh, sorry, I'm meeting someone. - I know. I'm the one you're waiting for. Hi, I'm Kelly. (tense music) - Excuse me. - It's me Kelly from Hitched. (Dillan laughs) - That is very funny. Is this a joke? - No. - Did Kyle put you up to this? - No. - That fucking son of a bitch. (laughs) - Dillan? - Okay. - It's me. - Enough enough. Please, I really am meeting somebody here, okay? Hey, wait... I know you. You're the crazy psycho I blocked a month ago. - No, no, no, no, no, you- - Don't. Don't touch me. - Dillan? Dillan, wait, please. Wait! Dillan! Please, please, I can explain. - Explain, what? That you faked your whole profile. Are you fucking crazy? - Wait, wait, wait, wait. - What did you think you could trick me into liking you by pretending to be someone else? - No, I thought you liked my profile because I saw with that other girl on the street, and I thought if I looked more like her you would like me. - Wait, you've been following me? - No, no, no, no. - Stay the fuck away from me. - I haven't been following you. I swear, Dillan. I jog in the park sometimes, and when I saw you on the street with her, it was just a coincidence. I swear, Dillan, please. - Oh my God, you know for the record, I blocked you because of your crazy fucking messages. - Then why did you even like my photo in the first place? - I didn't! I didn't, it was an accident. Actually, I find you utterly fucking repulsive. (Kelly sobs) - You fucking skeeve me. - (sobs) No, Dillan, no. (somber music) (sobs) Dillan, no! Dillan! (Kelly screams and sobs) (phone buzzes) - Vanessa, I've gotta talk. Meet me at the park. Call me back. You are not gonna believe what fucking happened. (somber music) - Dillan! (suspenseful music) and find my way across a banger, so I text her. She's down for anything. Italian restaurant, movie theater, done. She finishes her meal and my meal. Bitch could be hungry. So we go over to the movie theater and we're sitting in the corner. We're making the nasty, and she's kissing all over me. I'm kissing all over her. As my hand goes down the tunnel of love. I reach a sweaty, meaty horse cock. I let go of that bitch and I never looked back. Who knew she could be a he? (suspenseful music) (phone buzzes) - Hey there. - Hey. - What's up? - Not much, thanks for coming. - Sure. Okay, tell me all about it. What happened? - She faked her profile. - (laughs) You got catfished. - It's not funny. - Well, I told you she was a puta. - Oh, Ness, please. - Please what? Don't give me this bullshit. What were you expecting from a fucking app? - I can't believe what happened last night. He turned out to be such a small man. (phone buzzes) - What is this a lecture now? - You know what? I don't have time for this shit. (speaks in foreign language) - Okay, okay. Stop. I'm sorry. - So worried about what even the bartender thinks, what am I not hot enough for his precious image? - I called you because I needed a friend. I don't wanna fight about this, please. - Okay? - When someone you love plays with your feelings, that's just sick manipulation. Was he trying to trick me into feeling for him with stories about his dead father? - I just feel so stupid, you know? - Why? - She ended up being some psycho that I blocked a month ago. - Well, that's fucked up. - Yeah. - Big deal, his father wasn't proud of him. Get over it. Oh, poor little Dillan, daddy isn't proud. Daddy, doesn't like the guitar. - Dillan, I'm your friend, and I love you. You need to understand something, real people, it's not here in an app. - I know I wasn't completely honest when I posted pictures of that other woman. - It's in here, in your heart. (both chuckling) - I know, I know it might sound corny, but it's not, it's true. - Yeah, maybe you're right. - Thank you. - Of course. - But when we connected, that was the real me. I blindly gave myself to him with complete trust. What does he do with that? He lies and tricks me into falling in love with him. Meanwhile, the whole time he only wanted her. - Dillan, don't do that, please. - He has no idea what it feels like to be rejected. He has no idea what real suffering is. - Dillan? (suspenseful music) come on! - He has what it feels like when someone gives you hope, (sobs) and makes you believe that you're really worth it, when you're not. (suspenseful music) Hope. (sobs) You really gave me hope. (sobs) Fuck you! Fuck you! (Kelly sobs) (somber guitar music) I hate you, I hate you, I hate you. (sobs) - I find you utterly fucking repulsive. I fucking skeeve you. (Kelly sobs) (Dillan spits) (somber music) (car honks) (suspenseful piano music) - Look it's Pam. Where's Sam? I never see them apart. Did he dump her too? (suspenseful piano music) And these motherfuckers always seem to get away with that. Don't worry, Pam, I'm not gonna let that happen. (suspenseful music) (tense music) (device chiming) - Hey pal. Why so grim? Ooh, let me guess, bad date with the phone girl? - She's a psycho. - I'm psycho. - Anyway, I don't really wanna talk about it. How about we talk about something a little bit more interesting? - Why, what are you so happy about? - Well, my friend, it's not exactly what I'm so happy about, but what are you so happy about? - No. - Yeah. (chuckles) - Dude? Don't fuck with me, please. - I'm not fucking with you, man, you did it. The integration process went off without a hitch. - Oh, my God. - Laugh, laugh, laugh. - I told you to focus on work. - It fucking worked. - Off course, it did. - Well, I was hoping to be the first one to break the big the big news, but I guess I'm a little late. - Dillan. - Yeah. - Jack would like to see you in the board room. - Yeah. - Shit! (sinister music) (suspenseful music) - Hi sir. - Hey, please have a seat - Yeah, sure. - Well, I wanted to let you know that the board's carving out something that I think you're gonna be very happy with. Dillan, I wish your father was here to see you now, he'd be very proud. - Thank you, sir. I wish he were here too. - Oh, please, call me Jack, but he used to talk quite a bit about how proud he was of you. - Really, I always thought I just disappointed him. - Well, yeah, Tom was tough, but oh man, he used to tell me stories about how the cops would have to come to your house 'cause the band was playing too loud, huh? We'd laugh our asses off, talking about you, and all the stunts that you'd pull. You were something, huh? (laughs) Geez! - Yeah God, I just always thought I pissed him off. - He was very proud of you. You're a lot like him, you know. He always used to say that he hoped that one day you'd understand why he was so hard on you. - It was his biggest fear, really. - I wish I knew that side of him. - Dillan, you are that side of him. - Yeah. Thanks again, Jack. - Don't think me son, you earned it. (tense music) (duck quacks) (Kelly laughs) - Oh my God. I am so happy you came over for dinner tonight. I'm so glad you changed your mind. - Me too. And you look gorgeous by the way. - Really, I look gorgeous? - Really, I look gorgeous? - You do. - Thank you, it's a new dress. - Thank you, this is a new dress. - Well, it suits you. - I am so happy you came over for dinner tonight. I'm really glad you changed your mind. I always knew this was fate. - By the way, this food is incredible. - You love it. - I love it. - You love it? It's duck. It's my first time making it. - My friend knows the chef, and she recommended it to me. - My friend Pam, she's the one who recommended it for tonight's dinner. (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (woman laughs) - Do you not like your dinner? You hardly touched it. (sighs) I thought you like dark meat, just like that whore in the street. Look at what my friends sent me. He made it himself. Have you ever heard of Rohypnol? This stuff is like five times stronger. Wanna try some? - Yes, so I met this girl, right, online. - A little in my wine. - So you think you're like, you've found a great match. - [Kelly] Try it. - So I meet her at a bar, and I'm thinking I'm gonna meet the woman of my dreams. - I said try it! - And then I get to meeting this girl, and she catfished me. - Oh my gosh. - This has to be mistake. I thought I was dreaming. (Kelly sobs) I think she said, "Yeah, I'm the one you're waiting for." (woman laughs) I couldn't believe it. I was like. - Fucking hate you! (plates cluttering) I hate you. (sobs) (somber piano) (suspenseful music) (tense music) (car engines revving) (suspenseful music) - So when I was teaching my yoga class the other day. - Ah, is there any messages? - No messages, but I did get this envelope. Do you know who this is? - Dillan, yeah, yeah, that's my best friend. Yeah, I'll make sure he gets it. Thanks. - Anyway, when I teach my yoga classes. (tense music) That midget had been in the back row all week. (Kyle knocks) - It's open. - Bro, you are ready for the big launch today? - As ready as I'll ever, man. - Cool, lady at the front desk asked me to give this to you. I don't know what it is. Apparently, it's urgent. - Yep, thanks. - So you're out there, bro. - Yeah. (suspenseful music) - Lang Holding, here we go, again. (phone buzzes) Fuck you, Alexis. (phone buzzes) (phone rings) (suspenseful music) - Yeah. Yeah, big day, launch. very excited. - Prepare to be penetrated. Fucking ruin your life. You cock-sucking asshole. (ominous music) - The 12th, I'll be there. No problem. You need me to come up? Yeah. (tense music) (machine shuts down) (suspenseful music) (computer beeps) (tense music) - Get him up. Get him up! - What's going on? - You know what's going on? - Fuck, it's all locked up. - Pull the goddamn plug, shut the fucking thing down. - It doesn't work like that, Jack. - What did you do? - What the fuck did you do? - What's goin' on? - I wanna the entire, what did you do? - The entire server is crashing. It's all gone, man. It's going, - What happened? (Kelly laughs) - Who's laughing now? Are you making daddy proud? - You're finished here, all right? - What is going on? - Is he proud now? - What is this? - That was in a package, Kyle, brought me this morning. - What package? What is it? - Jesus Christ, it might have a virus or a fucking Trojan horse on it. - Shit! Get that downstairs. Have it checked out. I wanna know what damage has been done. - I told you to have your shit dialed in, damn it, focus! - And you, you little piece of shit, you're fired. - Jack? - I want him escorted out of the building. - Jack, I swear, - Jack? - I had nothing to do with this. - Jack! - You fucking, you're going down, man. - Jack, Jack, come on, Jack. - You know what you did. - Jack? - You know what you did. You're lucky if you don't end up in jail, son. Your father is rolling over in his fucking grave. - Don't you dare talk about my father. You hear me, jack. I will fucking kill you. - If only your father could see you now! I will fucking kill you, Jack. - Get him out of here. - Fuck you, fuck you, Jack. - Get him out! (Jack panting) Sorry, Tom. (suspenseful music) - (sobs) Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Okay, all right. Fuck! Fuck! Okay, okay, okay. Come on. Come on. Come on, pick up. (phone buzzes) (phone dials) Hey bro, I can't believe what fucking just happened in there. Look, just call me back when you got a second, all right? - Tell Jack, I'm sorry. Oh my God. I'm sorry bro. (suspenseful music) (phone buzzes) Talk to me bro. - Everything's going crazy around here. - Okay, did you hear anything yet? - Look, as far as, whatever the hell, this thing is, it literally shut down the entire mainframe. We can't get anything. - Holy fuck. - And as far as the source, there's nothing, absolutely nothing. Whoever did this just fucked us all together. - So you believe me? Oh Christ, man, I know I shouldn't have blown up on Jack like that, man. - Jack? You're worried about Jack right now. Dillan, as your best friend, get your head out of your ass. They're talking about prosecution here, man. Do you wanna go to jail? Because I don't. - Let me know if you find anything out. (upbeat music) - Is everything okay? - I need a shot. - Of course. - Another. (upbeat music) Another. - What? - Another. - Come on. Please, tell me what's going on? - Another. - You know what? That's it. I'm sorry. You can't do this. Look at the time, I just opened it and you're drinking like this. I don't get it. Please, tell me what's going on. - What do you care, okay? - Can I have another shot, please? - Don't be an asshole, or I'll throw you the fuck out of here, okay? And you know I will. - I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I just lost my job. - Wait, what? That's impossible. I mean, it's your dad's company. What are you talking about? (suspenseful music) - You know, I actually I have no idea what happened, but I gotta hit the head. I'll tell you about it when I get back. Just one more and a vodka soda, please. - Yeah, I'm out of soda. - Surprise me. - Okay, but that's it after this. (upbeat music) Hi there. How can I help you? - Just a water. I'm meeting my friend. He lost his job today. - Your friend? - Mm-hmm. - Who are you? - I'm Stacy. - So Stacy, how do you know Dillan? - We met in a coffee shop one afternoon. He was watching me code. liked my work, came over and started talking to me. - Is that right? - Yeah, actually we really hit it off. - Well, good for you. - On second thought, I'll take a vodka soda. - Well, I'm out of soda, so I will have to go to the back and grab some, if that's okay. - No problem. - Oh, all right. (Vanessa speaks in foreign language) - Bye bitch, take your fucking time. (phone buzzes) Nope. (blues guitar music) - (sighs) Isn't this just fucking perfect. - Just wait. - Are you following me again? - Yes, but can you just give me one second before you freak out? - Yes. - Listen, I came here today to apologize to you. I'm really sorry. I was totally crazy, and you didn't deserve that. I'm so sorry. - I got fired today. - Oh my God, I'm so sorry. - Yeah, me too. - Truce? - Yeah, truce. (blues guitar music) (suspenseful music) - What's wrong? Are you all right? A little too much to drink. - You see my phone? - Oh, I haven't seen it anywhere. Are you sure you didn't leave it in the car? - I didn't leave it in the car. I left it right here on the bar. - I don't know, I don't see anything Are you sure you're okay? - Yeah, I'm just (indistinct). (suspenseful music) Wow, you know, you really are fucking repulsive. (laughs) - I know, baby. (Dillan laughs) Come on, come on. - Oh sit. (laughs) Oh, where's my phone. - Come on.

(Kelly laughs) - Correction, present tense, Dillan. Present. Do you know why they call the now the present? - What the fuck are you talking about? - Answer the question? Do you know why they call the now the present? - I don't know, why? - Because the present is a gift. What kind of gift do you think I have for you? - I don't want any gifts. I don't deserve any presents. - (chuckles) But I assure you. You do. You are going to get exactly what you deserve. - Look, man, please. I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. That's my phone. Wait, you stole my phone? - Oops. Yes, I stole it and cracked it. So interesting what you can find on someone's phone. Is this what you want? Is this why we can't be together? - We're just friends, I swear. - Yeah, sure you are. (sobs) I know you've been fucking her! You've been fucking her the entire time you were talking to me. You lying, cheating bastard. - What? I've known Vanessa since elementary school. - Don't you say her name! (phone buzzes) Huh, speak of the devil. Hey Dillan, are you okay? Did you leave with that girl? Please, let me know what's going on. Call me. (laughs) Actually, I don't care about that fucking bitch. What really interests me are these other messages? - Kyle - Hey bro, we found the source of the hack. Jack knows it wasn't you. Come back in. - You fucking bitch! - But wait, there's more. Hey brother, why haven't you answered? Is everything okay? I'm starting to worry. Oh, he's worrying. - Fuck you! (Kelly laughs) - And then there's a bunch of voicemails, blah, blah, blah. Too bad, so sad. So sorry. - Fuck you! (Kelly laughs) Why are you doing this to me? - Why? Why? You tell me why? Why is it that men never know why? Is it because they're just dumb, or are they pretending to be dumb, or are they just trying to make us think that we're crazy, or are they that disconnected from reality? Why? (Dillan sobs) Are you crying? You don't get to cry. - I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry. - What? - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? You're sorry. Sorry for what? (suspenseful music) sorry for what? - I'm sorry about everything, okay? (Dillan sobs) (suspenseful music) - Ugh, pathetic! You're not even a real man. Pathetic, sad, repulsive, Dillan.
