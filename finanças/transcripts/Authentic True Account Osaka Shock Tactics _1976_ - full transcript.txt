OPERATION PLAZMA IN OSAKA TSURUHASHI (KOREA TOWN) SHOPPING ALLEY RESPECT THE SAFETY MEASURES AGAINST FIRE OSAKA SORYU HEADQUARTERS TSURUHASHI SHOPPING ALLEY SORYU GROUP ORGANIZATION OCT. 8, 1960 - Pretty good turnout. - Yeah, not bad. - The Boss? - He's there. Hey. Now for the fourth welterweight match. In the blue corner, from Nankai Boxing Club... Sanada Ichiro, 141 lbs. In the red Corner, Kyokuyo Boxing Club... Machine Gun Joe, 144 lbs. We're counting on you! Don't let us down! You can't lose, you hear! 10 on the red. Everyone's betting on the red. Who's stupid enough to bet on the blue? Old man, we'll bet on the blue. Sure thing. How many? - I'll take everything that's left. - What? There's a fool betting on the blue. It takes all sorts... there's a prime example of an idiot. Let's enjoy the sight! Ichiro, your opponent has a flabby gut. Let him hit all he wants. And when he's tired himself out, go for his gut. Ichiro, go! Hands off! Stop! Stop, I said! What the hell are you doing?! Idiots! What are you thinking going crazy like that?! Now it's a huge loss for us. It's no big deal. How much in all? Who the hell do you think you are? You have no clue. Enough! Don't mess with my events! I get it. I won't interfere, even if there's a fire. Oh, you're still here? Hurry up and refund him. You're... the boss of the Nanbara Group? Forgive me, I've had a bad evening. We need to have a little chat. My name is... Takeshi Daito, chief of the Daito Group. Is that right? I'm Miyatake from the Nanbara Group. Please. I heard you were released last month. - I'm glad you came. - Thank you. I was inside for 5 years. It seems nothing remains of the world I once knew. - Please. - Thanks. So... what did you want to talk about? You see, Mr. Miyatake... I'm the new owner of this dance-hall. - Uh? - See here... I completed the registration today. With the previous owner... you had a lease on a monthly basis. We'll have to renegotiate this. Mr. Daito... what are you planning? I'm planning on running a cabaret. This area is ruled by the Nanbara Group. Don't you think you should have talked to us about it first? You don't have to be so square. Mr. Daito... as we like to say, "Don't let an amateur get in the ring." Is that right? Do you see me as an amateur? Despite so many people who didn't take me seriously... I think I've made quite a name for myself in this world. Hey, Mr. Daito. We made a firm contract. We aren't moving out. Get it? You can go now. Mr. Daito. At any rate, we'll meet the owner. We'll call you back. You really don't get it... this place is mine now. Alright, I'll give you one more day. Make sure you've cleared the place by tomorrow. You've been notified. How dare he take that attitude with us. Boss, are you gonna let him get away with it? We'll lose if we face him head on. He did the same thing to Mr. Shinjo from Tennoji. They want to rattle us a bit. A real pain in the ass got out of jail. Daito and his grunts are a pack of hit men. Miyatake, is he really running a cabaret? Yes. There's a sign that says "Daito Business" outside his office. This looks like a turf war. Mr. Nanbara. We can't let him roam free. Boss, we need to force him out. Leave it to us. Don't even think about it. You'll end up just like Sasaki and Shinjo. Yeah, exactly. "Don't wake up a sleeping tiger." What is he actually up to? What do you mean? Think about it. That space is worth at least 50 million. Daito was gone for 5 years. How could he have that kind of money? I had the same question so I looked into it. It's a 38 million contract... and he paid 25 million cash in advance. See, he's up to something. Someone's pulling the strings. Who could it be? You do it too! Do it, do it, do it! Do it, hey! Alright, alright. Do it! Stop! Someone! Please help! Sir, please stop, sir... Someone! No! You're supposed to provide good service! What don't you like about us?! Stop! Great, great, wakame sak√©, it's delicious! Come on, let it drip! Stop! What's going on here? Useless Soryu Group! Come here, bastard! You want beer? I'll give you some! I'll show you! Come on, drink up! ISHIMURA GROUP OFFICE WEST OSAKA, YOTSUBASHI Let's run! Get back! Fire, fire, get the extinguisher! You had it coming, bastards! Put out the fire! Boss. Hey! Listen! The Ishimura Group has three clubs. If you crush those little brats... it's drinks and whores galore! Okay, okay, I won't ask you anymore! I can't count on any of them! Can't find fighters, can't find supplies... it's always excuses! But Mr. Nanbara said he'd send back up right away. - Don't hold your breath, it's all talk! - Boss! They're here! Who are you guys? I'm Kakeda from Sakuragawa, open up. - Open. - OK. What is it, Mr. Kakeda? I heard you're having trouble with Soryu. - I've come to support you. - Support us? You don't have to worry. We'll put those crazy bastards in their places. Thank you, we appreciate it. Frankly, I didn't think you'd come to our aid, not in my wildest dreams. Buddha reached out for us in hell. We're here for each other in case of trouble. The boss in Kobe is worried... so he called me. You mean Mr. Yamaji? Is that so? Mr. Yamaji's worried about us, huh? That's the prison in Sakai. Last month, on the 28th. Who is it? Takeshi Daito. So that's Daito? Two younger bosses, Kanazaki and Matsui, picked him up. Hey, Yamaji's there too. Right. The young boss from the Kawada Group, Takeo Yamaji, and his minion, Masamichi Iwai. Why did Yamaji come for Daito? What does he want with such a small-time thug? There's an inn in Abeno... and Yamaji's got his woman managing the place. Miyatake, where did you get these photos? Did you take them? I got them from the police. I have a cop in Section 4. Apparently, Daito exchanged sake with Yamaji at that inn... and forged a partnership. What? Are you sure about that? The information from the police confirms it. What the hell is Yamaji thinking... taking in a crazy lunatic like that? Obviously he wants to raise havoc and rattle us. The police say... that Yamaji has been planning to set foot in Osaka since last year. Mr. Kitagawa with Juso... Mr. Kakeda with Sakuragawa... Mr. Daito with Tennoji... it seems that... we're surrounded by their troops on all fronts. Ishimura and Yamaji exchanged sake and now share a bond. Yamaji is out to destroy and conquer. The war has already begun. Mr. Nanbara. Soon he'll offer you the cup too. I... won't bend like Ishimura. He's a stain upon Osaka's groups. Does that mean you're going head to head with Kobe? I sure am. But the Kawada Group has 400 groups under them... that's 18,000 young men. Numbers don't matter in war, determination does! Well said, Mr. Nanbara. You're brave. But are we up to the challenge? Everyone... what are you afraid of? That's how we get such a bad reputation. Who cares about Kawada or Yamaji? Don't you think it's time we showed them what Osaka yakuza are made of? Well... of course... we're determined as well, but... Really, what a bunch of useless punks. If at least one of you had balls like Tennoji... my life would be easier. I've discussed with Takayama... and we'd like you to let us handle this matter. What do you plan to do? We'll dispose of Yamaji. What? You'll kill Yamaji? Yes. A clean job. Do you plan to call a hit on him? Just leave it to us. Your involvement will never be known. They're already holding our feet to the fire... there's no other way to solve this. Or do you intend to... start a straight-up firefight with Kawada? Alright. Good. Namiko, serve them some sake. Hey. Hey, Takayama. Have some crab. Make yourself at ease. Thank you. Do you know Yamaji's whereabouts? Yes, it seems he frequents the Kisen Inn. This is going to shake our world. Mr. Yasu, someone for you. Hey, the guy who bet on blue the other day. What are you doing here? You want to resume the fight? I came to talk with Yasuda. Come with me. Why should I listen to what you have to say? Get him out. Wait. How about we settle this in the ring? Alright, come in. Hey, that's some tattoo. - Is that a cat? - Seems so. Let's make violin strings with its bowels. Hey. I don't need that. Idiot, in a ring you respect the rules... there's no exceptions. I'll be the referee. Alright. Boss, don't hold back. Hey, "Violin Strings," beware, our boss is pro-level. Boss, will you be OK? Leave it to me, I'm not losing against that brat. Alright... One round, no time limit... until one of us is down. - Alright. - Boss... feed him your left uppercut, keep distance with jabs and give him a right to the chin. Fight. Boss! Boss, right there! Boss! Uppercut, uppercut! Good one, Boss! - Are you a faggot?! - Play fair, bastard! - That's foul play! - What the hell are you doing?! Uppercut! So, what did you want to talk about? I want to kill a man. Lend me a hand. What? Are you a prankster? Who's the mark? Yamaji. Eh? Yamaji? From the Kawada Group? That's right. Say... is that an order from your boss? Nope... it's my own idea. Hey... Yamaji wants to take Osaka. Everyone knows, yet no one does anything. The way things are going... soon there'll be no one in Osaka to face him. Don't let him deceive you. You can't trust that guy. Boss. If this is for real, we should talk to the Big Boss first. Enough, guys. Stay out of it. Hey. I like your foolish ways. Either way, there's no one else I can rely on. KISEN, RESTAURANT AND INN All right, then. I've had him remember his face from the photos. Listen. Don't get involved. You told me a million times already. Don't worry. Their guys are in place and wanna take care of it themselves. They're very eager. - I'll be back when it's done. - Boss! Hey! Damn it, bulletproof glass. Don't lose him. Drive up to his side... I want to see Yamaji's face. Shit! Boss! Boss. Those guys are young ones from the Nanbara Group. Should we get rid of them? All in due time. I'll have Osaka under control without shedding blood. Boss. Mr. Nanbara. Sorry to intrude... please come with me. What do you want? You'll gain nothing by killing me. I have all the yakuza in Osaka backing me. You think you can touch me... and get away with it? DAITO BUSINESS OFFICE Where's Daito? What do you want?! Shut up! It was Daito that kidnapped our boss, wasn't it?! Give us Daito! I don't know anything! KIKUYA RESTAURANT, KOBE HANAKUMA Mr. Nanbara... Thank you for coming. Please come in. Mr. Nanbara, actually... Mr. Yamaji... I don't know what you think of me, but... I've no intention of going against Kobe. Some of our youngsters have been reckless and gone out of control... but it has nothing to do with me. I just wanted you to understand. Actually, today... on my way here... There were a few idiots that tried to get me. I knew it... I'm so sorry... I know my apologies are worthless. I'm deeply sorry for my inability to manage my men. I'll make them pay. Please be patient. Mr. Nanbara. Well, well... Youngsters can be difficult. You're like a father to them. Mr. Yamaji... Kids don't understand how parents feel. There's always difficult ones in every generation. Thank you. Thank you... hearing you say that, my heart is... Mr. Nanbara... I called you here... realizing the misunderstanding. In Osaka... I know my actions make people nervous. But my intentions are sincere. You see... We'll lend a hand for those who need it. We'll help those in trouble. That's Kawada's unwavering policy. We need to end these useless wars. That makes perfect sense. And you... are considered one of the pillars of Osaka. I want to extend a friendly hand, and lend you my strength. Let's call it... building a bridge between Kobe and Osaka. Mr. Yamaji... I'm deeply touched by your offer. When you put it that way... I have to accept. I concede. The way this is going, if we keep fighting... eventually there'll be nothing left of us. I, Masayuki Nanbara, dedicate my life... for the sake of Kobe and Osaka. Boss! You're alright! The Boss is here! Boss, you're back safely. Welcome back. Miyatake, come! Yes. Miyatake, you assured me you'd handle him! You mean Yamaji? I thought I could count on my men. Boss, what happened? Please, tell me. What is Takayama up to? I told him not to leave the house. According to the young ones, he's hurt. I want that brat banned. - What? - I want him banned today. Boss. Why? Takashi did his best for the sake of our group. The responsibility falls on me. You see, today I exchanged sake with Yamaji as a token of our friendship. - Why'd you do that? - I thought this all through. But why? Don't pester me! Women should butt out! Beer, bring us beer! I'm sorry. It's my fault. How about it... could you and the missus... take a trip to the hot springs for awhile? What the hell for? Don't tell me you're going up against Yamaji again. You may have exchanged sake but the relationship isn't sealed yet. Idiot! What do you think you can do now? I have no face to show anymore. - Boss... - Not another word! I don't want to hear more. You can bet the whole world... considers me old and weak now. But... I have more than 60 people in my care. I can't fight a battle I know I can't win. Right, Miyatake? Am I wrong? How about it? Am I wrong? Oh, Boss. How is he? I bumped my head on the car and went to sleep. I feel completely numb. It's amazing that you didn't die. I got so heated when I saw Yamaji's face. The Big Boss suffered the consequences. What do you mean? Takashi. You should disappear now. Don't return until I call you back. Hirai, come. Boss! Please tell me. What happened to the Boss? You don't need to know. I see. In that case I can't take your money. Takashi. The Boss told me... that we have to ban you. What? Just stay quiet and do as you're told. I'll take care of the rest. Oh. I've become a burden. Fine! Ban me or do whatever you want! But... I'm not taking one step out of Osaka. I'd rather die, than become... a beaten dog that's wagging its tail. You fool... enough of that bullshit! Takashi! Boss! Takashi! This is the end of our relationship! Just go, I'll be fine! If you want my life, come get it anytime! Outta my way! - Boss! - Hirai! Let him go! Boss! ATTACK ON MR. YAMAJI IN BROAD DAYLIGHT They don't know who did it? If they knew, it would all blow up in our faces. Are you stupid? Of course Yamaji knows. He's just choosing to ignore it. Yasuda. Why did you do this without the permission of the group? Do you want to end Soryu? Yasuda. When you had that fight with Ishimura... I told to avoid going against the Kawada Group at all costs. Say something! Chairman. I thought I'd help you wake up... since you seem to be slacking off these days! - What?! - Yasuda! Watch your mouth! Apologize! Before you get all upset, remember the past. We didn't start the Soryu Group so we could manage pachinko halls and cabarets. I'm telling you right now. I'm going against Yamaji again. I won't fail this time. You should prepare for war. Ban him, Chairman, ban him immediately! You can ban me if you like... but everybody knows me as Yasuda of the Soryu Group. If you don't like it, kill me now. - Yasuda, are you serious? - Yes. If we crush Kawada, Soryu will be number one in Japan. Chairman... wasn't that your intention when we started? He's off his rocker! Chairman, ignore him. You won't get through to him. Chairman! You all... have overestimated the Kawada Group. Sure, Kawada have 20,000 men... however... they're scattered around Shikoku and Kyushu. We have a thousand just in Osaka. If we took out Yamaji... we'd have more than a 1/2 chance of winning. Yasuda... your statistics are irrelevant. You don't know how powerful the Kawada Group is. As proof, even that Daito... shared sake and forged a relationship with Yamaji. Daito is Daito, we're different. Chairman. You just prepare for the aftermath, I'll do the rest. All the young men will follow me. - I won't allow it. - Chairman! I won't allow it and that's final! Yasuda! It's my duty to protect the Soryu Group! Interesting. I guess it's true that money rots people. Chairman. We can't let him do as he pleases. But all the young ones follow him. We're in a bind. Please, come in. What happened to him? He's been drinking all night. Boss. I went and got some milk. - Boss. - Uh? Get off! Boss... Hey, let's step out. Takayama. I was looking for you. Give me beer. I heard the group banned you. I called the office earlier. They were pretty unpleasant. Because of Yamaji... old man Nanbara is pissing his pants. The bosses of our world... they talk the talk but they're actually only thinking about themselves. But Soryu is different. It's a free democracy. Why don't you join the Soryu Group? - Nope. - Where are you going? Takayama! You and me... let's kill Yamaji. I admire your spirit... I heard you attacked Yamaji's car in the middle of the street. Incredible. Leave me alone. Yamaji. Who cares about Yamaji? It's all nonsense! Wait, Takayama. Alright. OK, how about this? You'll hang out with me tonight. "Young women..." "when three are together..." "chat, chat, chat..." "chat, chat, chat..." "rolling yellow cherry..." Takayama, how about it? Any these women will take good care of you. No need to hold back. Choose any of them. How about the one in the white dress? I hear she cries out loud during sex. Forget the green one. I hear she's super wet and smells. The yellow one. The yellow one? There's no yellow ones. The yellow one. "Looks like there's a chance..." "maybe not...?" "maybe yes...?" "it's like a yellow cherry." Takayama. That's a bad idea. She's our singer. You can have anyone but her. There's other good ones. You... said I could have anyone. Give me water! Water... Give me water! Give me water. Say... did Yasuda tell you to come? Stop. Do you think I'm not worthy? Come here. Come over here. Where are you going? Sit down. SUPPER CLUB GINNOSHIRO SOUEMON, MINAMI-KU Please stop, you're upsetting the other customers. What the hell d'ya want? Who do you think you're talking to? Hey, cut it out already! What? Tonight, Soryu owns this place! Any complaints? Please. Boss. Isn't that Minoru Matsuki? Where? Over there. Oh, that is Minoru Matsuki. Who's that peacock with them? I don't know. I don't know him. But the one in front... he's Tomoda. He's parading around like a bigwig, saying he's under Kawada... Interesting. So that's Tomoda. Matsu-chan. I'm a fan of yours. Could you sing a song for me? Sorry, Matsu-chan came to have a good time. Next time, sorry. I'm not talking to you! Hey, Matsu-chan. Let's have a drink. Come on, drink, come on. Hey, cut it out. Get off me! What the hell are you doing?! Over there! Enough now! Please gentlemen, stop! - Matsu-chan, let's go. - OK. Hands off! Do you know who this is? He's one of the Kawada bosses. Do you still want to fight? Boss, please go quickly. Boss, the police! DECEMBER 12, 2 A.M. Who are you? I'm Sanada, is Takayama with you? Hey, get up. Hey. The Boss? Mr. Takayama? Mr. Takayama? - Boss! - What is it this time? The police arrested Yasuda. What? Yocchan. So what happened? He had a fight with one of Kawada's bosses at a Minami club. One of Kawada's bosses... the third-generation heir? We didn't know he was a Kawada boss. They were all so heated. We started hassling this guy called Tomoda... I'm sorry. And the rest? Oiwa and his group got away. Is Yasuda injured? Did he get hurt? No, he's fine. Madam, what should we do? Go to the police right away. What? Are you Yasuda's girl? That girl's from Nagasaki, like me. She came here to become a singer. Yasuda and her... she thought they were in love. Yasuda, that idiot. SOUTH OSAKA POLICE CENTRAL Isn't she Yasuda's girl? Those are Tomoda's people. They're waiting to get Yasuda as soon as he comes out. Sir, Soryu's chairman is here. Daito, it's been awhile. Mr. Cho, you'll have to excuse me... I'm in a rush and need to go. Come on, don't be like that. Actually, I came here to ask a favor... something unfortunate happened last night. That idiot Yasuda is one of us, but he's so reckless... We'd like to apologize to Kawada's boss right away. Could you ask Mr. Yamaji? Impossible. First off, he won't accept it. Please, we need your help, Mr. Daito. We helped each other after the war. Mr. Cho, it's been more than 10 years since then. Why don't you educate your youngsters? Sure, but right now... Acting tough isn't enough to succeed as a yakuza. Well... if they don't kill you first... do as I did and start over. Mr. Daito! Mr. Daito, I'm begging you, please! I'm begging, Mr. Daito! Ah... Mr. Daito! Chairman, what should we do? I need to see Yamaji at all costs. Otherwise Soryu is finished. KAWADA GROUP KAWADA GROUP OFFICE IN KANDA DISTRICT This is more serious than their hit on me. We can't overlook this direct offense to you, Boss. Please, allow me... to dispose of the Soryu Group. Yamaji. How would you dispose of them? We'd have to go all out. You realize the implications? Remember, Soryu has 1,000 men. - Yamaji. - Yes? Let it slide this time. Boss. If they were a formidable group, that's one thing. But crushing bugs never made anyone stronger. They are bugs, but... they're bugs from our world... and they deserve a lesson. Perhaps you could just close your eyes for a while. I see. If you feel that strongly, I won't interfere. Don't get carried away. Regarding the matter at hand, the Boss wants nothing but a peaceful resolution. Boss, are we supposed to swallow this affront? We can't accept it. Boss, listen. It doesn't matter what the Big Boss says - if we don't put their heads on a stake... we'll be ridiculed all over Japan. We can get them without using Kawada's name. We can make it seem like a fight between Tomoda and Soryu. That's a great idea. Boss. Let's confine it to Osaka. Boss, phone call. Who is it? Don't worry. Mr. Yamaji... he listens to everything I say. Ah, it's you. Thanks for the other day. I'm sorry, I've been so busy since then. What do I want? It concerns the boss of the Soryu Group... Chairman Cho... asked for a favor, and he's here with me now. He wants to see you about last night's incident. Right... a reconciliation. Would it be possible for my sake... to see him? I appreciate the effort. But there's no reconciliation. We're unanimous. I'll see him only if his entire group commits suicide. What did he say? They agreed to meet you... if you offer your lives. Chairman. You were so kind to help. Well, I'm sorry I couldn't help this time. - Be careful on your way home. - Thank you. You heard that? That Yamaji is dreadful. It's expected from a man in his position. Consider this... all of Japan is watching how the Kawada Group responds. I suppose it's too late to turn back. DECEMBER 14, 8 A.M. Around the back! - Takayama. - Get in. How did you know? The police informed your woman beforehand. Boss. Stop, stop! That was close. You saved my life. I'm just returning a favor. You're talking about Yoshiko. Why can't you... admit that she's your woman? It's fine. You like her, right? Cut it out. If I knew she was yours... I would have never touched her. Boss, look out! Takayama. For me, it's simple. I'm OK if you're happy. Let's forget about it. KAKEDA GROUP Who are you? I'm from Beppu. I'm Seiji Hirata of the Nogawa Group. I'm from Moji. I'm Ichitaro Togawa of the Owada Group. We're boiling water for the bath. Please make yourselves at home. Thank you for coming. The men from Kyushu are here. By evening, everybody will be here. Once they're all gathered... you'll organize them in three-man squads. One man from Osaka in each squad. If we banded Osakans together... the police and enemy would spot them easily. Deliver this to Kakeda. So it's a manhunt... KINTETSU RAILWAY, BEHIND FUSE STATION - Evening. - Evening. - Evening. - Evening. How did it go? We don't know where Oiwa and his group went. The Chairman and the rest of them got rid of their houses and fled. Boss. Apparently his woman's in Sangenya, shall we go and see? No, it's alright. It's too late now. Yamaji's so lucky, isn't he? If we were at full strength, I think it would've been a good fight. What's so funny? I was super confident. But your stunt with the third generation heir was a blunder. That was entrapment. A yakuza boss shouldn't be walking around without a name tag around his neck. Hey, you should leave Osaka til things settle or you'll get caught in the fray too. What are you going to do? There's not much I can do but lay low. Until things cool down. We just need a little patience. Even the Kawada Group wants to avoid a huge mess in Osaka. It draws the cops' attention too. So... you won't go after Yamaji anymore? Hey. That Yamaji misfit... thinks he's gotten control of Osaka already. Doesn't it feel wrong... to recede like this? That's true. You're exactly right. He won't see it coming! Takayama, that's great! You've got some real firepower! 45 caliber. Bulletproof glass won't be a problem with this. Minami, #14. #2 for Matsui. #2, I'm in #2. Who's in #1? #5? Anyone? #5? #5? Guys, once you're in a squad, please line up. It's 3 men per squad. Miyatake. Why are you here? Doesn't the Nanbara Group have any decent youngsters to offer? Am I not good enough? Alright, sit down. You're not here... because of Takayama, are you? Listen. We can't let Takayama live. Same goes for Yasuda and his men. Did you come to help Takayama or to rat him out? I came for the sake of my group. If the Nanbara Group can't contribute now, the Kawada Group won't look upon us favorably. Do your best and show me what you've got. Guys... have a good look at these photos... remember these faces. Our main targets are: Chairman Sotai Cho... Vice Chairman Kotetsu... Toshiyuki Yasuda, Hiroshi Oiwa and Genki Kin. Those 5. Above all, we can't let Yasuda, Oiwa and Kin live. For efficiency purposes, we've divided the city into four quarters. Squads 1 to 4 will take the west quarter. I'll take command. Squads 5 to 8 will take the east quarter. Daito will take command. Long live small-time thugs! Headquarters. Patrol car 501. Currently 7 a.m., nothing to report. DECEMBER 15, 7 A.M. The place is surrounded, front and back. We're holding tight. Tell the men to disband and disarm. Hey, we don't carry guns. Hands in the air. Did you hear? Hands in the air! I'm just visiting Osaka. Why would I get into trouble here? Shut up, move. There, for you. There, for you. There, for you. Let me go, help! Here, let's have a drink. Help me! What are you saying? There, drink, drink. Where are the Soryu leaders? What the hell is Soryu? Little brat! Pretending not to know! Idiots! Damn, we got the wrong guys. Wh... what are you doing? Wow... hey... It's hot. I can't take it. I can't. Where are Yasuda, Oiwa and Kin? Just tell us where they're hiding. You're up there in Soryukai. You should know! Why are you doing this to me? I really don't know. Alright, I see. It's hot... it's hot... Please stop, help! Help, help! Look... I don't know. It's true. It's hot... Now bring the gasoline. I'll talk, I'll talk. I'll tell everything. I'll tell everything. SEICHIKUSOU APARTMENT BUILDING SANGENYA, TAISHO-KU DECEMBER 16, 5:10 P.M. Are you Oiwa? Kin? Damn bastards. We want Yasuda. Where's he hiding? Speak! Just tell us! Tell us! Just give up already! Talk! DECEMBER 17, 10 P.M. You came. Yocchan. Madam, let me stay. You can't. - Madam... - Yocchan. Do you want someone like that here? What do you mean by that? You became old and unpopular and this is what you turn into? It's not like that. I... I can't stand what you did to her. Yocchan, tell him to leave now. Yoshiko. It's alright. It's just an old hag whining. Come. You'll sleep here. I'll sleep on the floor. Hey. Are you still mad about Takayama? Being mad wouldn't do any good. You don't like me anymore, right? Idiot, I wouldn't offer him a woman I didn't like. You're the most important woman to me. I promise. You don't get it. You're the one who doesn't get it! I hate you! Get out! Tell me... do you really hate me? I hate you! Do you really hate me? I hate you, I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you so much. HAMADERA, SEASIDE HOTEL DECEMBER 18, 1 P.M. Chairman! Chairman. Men from the Kawada Group are here in the lobby. What? Hey... Did you lock the door? Chairman... where's your wife? Come here. We're screwed... We caught Chairman Cho. Vice Chairman Sai is with him. Cho wants to unconditionally surrender. What should we do? Hm... alright. Let him go home. Well... if we show mercy... the others will come out. Right. You did a great job. What's the date? The 18th. Now we just have to find Yasuda. We need to put an end to this by the end of the year. Start the preparations. Yes. 11 P.M. KISEN INN Who is it? Wait! Hey! Stop! Yamaji! Got you, bastard. So it's you... I figured either you or Yasuda would come. We've been expecting you. Hey... it's time you gave in. Where is Yasuda? Can't tell you if I don't know. I'll kill you, brat. I've been wanting to die... just do it! Brat, I'll make you talk. Enough. Why don't we sleep for... - a couple hours. - Boss! This isn't the time for sleep! Kakeda's gotten all the credit til now. If only we could get Yasuda... Don't rush it. Tomorrow will be fine. Let's go to bed. He's probably from Kawada. How did he find this place? He's coming... Madam, don't move. Mr. Yasuda, what are you doing? What is this? It's a disguise. They caught Takayama. What? Boss, what's the urgent matter? Get ready for a surprise. I know where Yasuda is. Really? He's in Tenman. It's behind the post office. At Igawa's place. Someone saw him there... and gave me a call. Who called? He didn't say his name. But probably from that club. So? How about it? You guys looked everywhere... and yet failed to find him. I didn't have to move an inch. It's because of Nanbara's reputation. The groups in Osaka... all come to our aid. Right, I'll go now. Hey, wait. Are you going to tell Daito? We should take care of it with our own guys. After all, Yasuda is this war's smoking gun. You'll be rewarded for his capture. You can take all the young ones with you. Alright then... I'll take only Nezu and Hirai with me. It'll be more discreet that way. Do it well... I'll take care of the rest. Right. "Come on yellow cherry..." Idiots. I'm the one who tipped off Nanbara. You guys... if you want to save Miyatake... tell Daito to bring me Takayama... to the junkyard in Sakuranomiya, at 4:00. You got it? Hurry, you don't have much time. Mr. Yasuda, you really think Daito will bring him? Of course he will... to kill me. Why? - What's your plan? - It's business. I just can't let them kill Takayama. You should know... how I feel. Stop all this! They're going to kill you! Daito! Did you bring Takayama? Boss! Takayama. Come here. Kill him, kill him! Wait! DECEMBER 24 YUBA HOT SPRINGS, HYOGO PREFECTURE - Hey. - Hey. I get it, but... "Unconditional surrender," what is that exactly? Well, I guess it's akin to... "Do whatever you wish to myself and my men." Well, everyone did a good job. One more hour to go. We arrived too early. Hey, Yasuda. Please come. Come in. Move. Hurry up. What is it? Take off your clothes. Body search. Wait a minute. You think I'll try again? I already offered my finger. You think a finger makes it all right? Well... Mr. Daito. Why don't you say something? I was in the hospital til yesterday. Your clothes. You guys... He isn't carrying a weapon. Take off the bandages. Mr. Daito, why all this? - Will you kill me? - Shut up. Boss! Take the stairs! Please! Let me kill him! Boss, Daito was murdered. "The number of Kawada men arrested in this incident..." "amounted to over 50, including the young boss Takeo Yamaji." "He was sentenced to 18 years, and..." "the total years of all the sentences..." "exceeded 300 years." "In addition to the enormous court-related expenses..." "for Kawada, the largest yakuza organization in Japan..." "the Soryu Group Incident..." "was recorded as the fiercest war they fought." THE END
