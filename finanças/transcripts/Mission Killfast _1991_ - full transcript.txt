That's got to be him. Yeah. He's got them. I'll have that drink now, Mr. Fike. You got it. Thee two Gizmos are worth a hundred perhaps. To some people. Fix me a drink, will you, please. Sure, Baby. So... When do we get the money? Upon delivery. At this time tomorrow, we'll be in South America. I drink to us. I will be in South America. I am here for Lacy. Get in. Lacy said these are worth a million dollars. Where are you getting at? Well, 25,000 is enough. We had a deal. Well, others might pay more. Oh, Maria, Maria. You know, it wasn't the curiosity that killed the cat. It was greed. Not so fast. Come on, you guys, follow me. Hey buddy, bring some of that camouflage net over here. I'll keep you posted, Sir. Get those nets over those weapons. Try this one. We'll pray to complete our assignment. Anytime, any place we're send. You don't question. You execute orders. I now give you the ultimate weapon. Hmm! Use this. Much more effective. Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Bremen. I'll get back to you. They just found Lacey in California. Dead. And the buttons are missing. You think that they are still in country, Sir? Yes, but you can bet they'll be moved pretty fast. I would think to probably one of the training camps on that list. Vallone was working on that end. In fact he did penetrate one camp. Vallone. Does he have any idea who's involved? Nothing we can hang our head on. But it looks like D'Apollito could be our man. I thought we put him out of business? He's back. His son has a skin magazine as a front. Now we've put a mole on that operation. As yet she hasn't turned up anything that we can tide those people in with. Harry I want you to get a hold on Tiger for me. Sir, I don't think Tiger Yang is going to be interested. He's running a string of very successful martial arts studios and he just finished a world tour. I think he has too many obligations. Harry, this is too important. I think with his help we can pull this out fast and quiet. Tiger. Harry. What are you doing here? We have to talk. I have a car. Two nuclear detonators are missing. We need your help. Don't try to make me feel guilty. I am business man now. I have obligations. It's D'Apollito. I thought he was out of arm bracket. He's back. Blake told me that nuclear components are being shipped from Germany to a third world country and last week Lacy made out with two of them. Now they have a bomb? If they get the components and the detonators together, yes. They have a bomb. Where do I fit in? Blake has a mole in D'Apollito's operation. Once she knows where the detonators are you stop the delivery. That's good, Chantelle. Now over here. Hey, Nick. I think we have to shut down the magazine. Shannon's getting out of hand here. He's my nephew. Don't worry, I handle it. I don't know, he's got people milling around there all hours, day and night. When you're dealing with models, that's the way it is. What's your problem? Do vou like the broads? Yes, I like the broads as much as you or anybody. But we're spreading ourselves too thin. I think we ought to go back to operating the way we used to. To use the plant as a front. Since when do you make decisions? Well, someone has to. You're losing control. Try and make a few sales. I'll handle security. I'll see that you do. We're in a... Hold it. Look, Anselmo... You only think you know what fike will say. You know what kind of deals he's making. We're not talking about a few guns, we're talking about nuclear detonators. Look, I don't want fike making all arrangements. Anselmo, this time your art's got real money, cash. This is not some ragged tag ideal that's trying to scrape a revolution together. Look, I still don't like it. I still... You pull out the buyers. I don't trust fike. He'd turn on his own mother if he know there's a profit to be made. You don't need to worry about the detonators, they're safe. But I've got to worry about Tiger Yang. Yana? Who the hell is Yang? He used to work for the govern a couple of years ago but he gave it up. So, what's the big problem? He's been met at the airport this morning by a couple of federal agents. Really? Does Nick know about this? I don't give a damn about what Nick thinks. I'll take care of it myself. Exactly, what are you getting at, Fike? We had a deal. And not even Nick or Tiger Yang is going to foul it up. Gentlemen, Gentlemen, take it easy. This is my cup of tea. I'll see to it. After all, that's what I get paid for. Give me Bremen. Yes. Listen, I got something for you. I owe you, Boys, a favor like I promised. This Master Yang saved my life once, see? But I kind of hate to see him blowing away. You know what I mean? Yeah, in the pray today. Fond Street. 900 block. That's where they're going to hit. Oh, hell. You now what I now. Take her from there. I am out of here, I am gone. And you don't know me, right? Ready? Okay. They are a block away headed to Peer Street. Are you sure everything is in place? It's all yours, Man. Not to worry. In a few minutes Yang will be history. Everything's under control. I still don't like it. Damn it, I don't like it at all. There. Let's go. Go check on the men. Freeze! Freeze! Something went wrong. Three guys were shot. Damn it, Fike. I thought you told me everything was covered. I don't know. Let's get the hell out of here. Hey, you men look alive. Got something coming out on the scanner. Okay, okay. Thank you, Gentlemen for your generous order. Shipping will be made when your funds are received. Your plane is ready, Sir. Have a good trip. Thank you. What will we do with this traitor, Vallone? I've known about you for sometime, Vallone. Only I've been waiting to find out who else you are working with. Two of your comrades we've executed earlier. No matter. We'll find all your friends. But for you... I am sorry, your job is finished. Kill him. I have a feeling that you and Vallone knew each other before joining us. Don't be ridiculous. I've only been in this country a few days. I don't think I believe you. Chantelle. What are you doing here? Faxing this out tonight? You're forgetting the time difference, Nick. What are you looking for in that file? I thought my photographs were in the top drawer. Shannon's magazine files are over there. That's where your photographs are. Oh. Here they are. Sorry I startled you, Nick. Have a good evening. Hey. Next time you want to come here at this our of the night, call me first. Okay, Nick. Good night. That's it. Get me a reservation to my flight to LA and have a chopper meet me at the airport. Thank you. Did you get a hold on Tiger yet? Yes, Sir. He doesn't want to be part of it. He doesn't have a choice, we got to have him. Vallone is dead. Oh, no. He was a good man. He'll be missed, but he got some information out before he was killed. I have people working on that now. Last night we got a fax from our mole. They're moving a shipment. Do you think that the detonators are in that shipment? I don't know, but they got to be stopped. Where are they headed? I don't know that either. These guys are fanatics and highly mobile. Yes, Sir. Muyedo combining... All the different martial arts into one different art. And the Bu teach you how to defend yourself. The art to respect you and the others. Toi's Philosophy teach you how to discipline your mind and bodies. I show you. That could all be a discipline in mind and bodies. I almost forgot how good Tiger really is. The best. He has the trophies to prove it. That are some good moves. Practice continue. Yes, Sir. Welcome, Gentlemen. Mr. Blake wants to talk to you. Do you have some place more private? I'll come straight to the point, Tiger. We think D'Apollito and his men are moving a shipment of arms. We have every reason to believe that the arm shipment contains the two nuclear detonators I told you about. They must be stopped. Call out the National Guard. We can't do that. There's nothing illegal about selling weapons. To legitimate governments, that is. We don't want an embarrassing situation. You want me to break the law? Not exactly. The president doesn't want to risk a full scale intervention. We have been friends long time, Harry. If you want me to help, please be honest with me. Okay, Tiger. We can't touch him. We want you and your black belts to go in there and break up their party. If the two detonators are there, all that shipment is heading to an unrecognized government. We'll step in and make some arrests. I told Harry... I'm not interested. Tiger, don't you feel you have an obligation to your country? How much time do we have? Two days. Alright, tell me everything. I drink to celebrate, Mr. Murak. Hi, Baby. Here. I hope we're not a little bit premature. The transfer is taking place as we speak. Fike will call me any moment with the good news. Baby, why don't you go take a little swim? What about those detonators? They're not part of the bargain. We got to negotiate. I must have them. I've got to have them. And you shall, Mr. Murak. You shall. That would be Mr. Fike. Yeah. You get Charlie and tell him to get here now. What happened. A little set back. What kind of set back? I think we have a leak. But the plumber is on the way. Are you sure, Harry? Yes, Sir. We've gone through everything. The detonators are not here. Any ideas? D'Apollito's got to have them stashed. His plant, maybe? IT's a possibility. Okay, check it out and keep me posted. Even the president is watching us. Sir, Tiger has promised me that he'll see this thing through. Good. I'll feel a lot better when we're on top of it. Good luck, Harry. Thank you, Sir. You suspect my son? No, Sir. Not at all. But somebody may be coming in the back door by the way we have the magazine. If Shannon is at fault at all, it's just that... Your security is to lax. And what are you doing about it, Nicholas. We're conducting which you might call a process of elimination. Our security found that one of the girls wasn't was she said she was. What she was or who she was nobody knows. So we had Charlie... Send her away. Anselmo. Heard about the situation? We have to talk about it. By the way I... Shannon! If you excuse me, Sir, I have some things to attend to. I want to check on the Johnson & Smith Silver Company deal. Fine, Nicky. Did you want to see me, Dad? Yes. I want to talk to you. Where did you get the money, Son? Money, what money? Don't cue with me, Shannon. Two months ago your attorney came to me because you were broke. You were going under. I turned him down, because I wanted you out of that stupid girly magazine business. Now, where did you get the money? I got the money. You turned me down, I got it and that's all. I wanted to put you in charge of the casino to make something with yourself, to be something. Not wasting vour life playing with girly pictures and crap like that. Now, where did you get the money? Lenders. Private investors. What private investors? People, just people. They prefer to remain anonymous. Shannon, sometimes I think I raised my son to be an idiot. There is no such thing as anonymous people. What kind of game are you trying to play anyway? What's happened to you? Did you let those girls screw you out of your investment? You like these girls. And your clients like those girls, so leave me alone. I got problems. You think you've got problems? Yeah. I've got problems. Big ones. Well, maybe we have the same problems. Four easy. Next number 44. Less than 48 hours ago we completed the deal with the Middle East. And this morning I got another one of these from New York. And last night another shipment was intercepted. And Rafael's compound was blown to bits. If this keeps up, we're out of business. And I'm up one and a half million, Gentlemen. Million. Now, who is it? None of you, Gentlemen, have been to New York. None of you've communicated with New York. I know, I had you watched. Don't look so surprised. Do you think I am going to take everybody on faith when I've got the damn extortionists bleeding me to death? There's enough information in this letter that hang us all. Dates, names, transportation data, everything. The Feds could be on us any minute. Now how the hell is this happening? Now I want everybody on top of this. I want the security so tight that nobody could get to us. If we have to, we'll send all damn staff away. Yes, Sir. Now get the hell out of here. Tell me, Nicholas, what do you really think about Shannon? I think the same thing you do, Mr. D'Apollito. What's that. Well, as you said... Could be anybody. One of the staff, one of the girls. Even Shannon. I think we have to keep Charlie busy. These last two installations must be destroyed next. Oh, there you have it, People. So you see what we're up against. Terrorists receiving sophisticated weapons of every sort. Small groups are becoming better equipped on their trained paramilitary counter parts. And it will get worst until we find every source of supply they have and cut the lines. What motivates them? What the hell drives them? Religion, patriotism. Traditional motivations are tougher to deal with. There are in a man's guts, his belief system. Vallone had a daughter. They were very close. Someone's got to tell her. Tiger will tell her. Slavitza, you go with me. Tell her as little as you have to about details. Give her the entire department's condolence. Here's where she lives. We've had her checked out from time to time for old man's sake. I don't feel she knew anything about the last assignment. But we try and protect our people as best we can. We got to double the force investigating every conceivable source of supply they have. And re-check every registered manufacture on the listing. Slavitza. I am sending you on a similar assignment to the last. Well, meeting is adjourned. Hey, look I am busy. Fine. Line two for Mr. Bremen. Uh, excuse me. Yes. Shannon, I asked you not to call me here. Somebody is shooting real bullets in my vicinity, and you said there wouldn't be any of that. There are no guarantees. My father is asking a lot of questions. And I don't think it was a coincidence that Denise just happened to be your agent, do you? Listen, Shannon. That loan was arranged with the promise of your help and I might add for a lot more money that you required. So I expect a lot more in return than this. If you're so damn sure your father is not involved... What's the problem? Alright, we won't plant anyone else. But I want you to find out something for me. We're concerned that the agency is becoming compromised. Find out why she was killed. If you father's connections or associates are involved and if they know about us. You do that, you're off the hook on your loan and everything else. You'll think of something. I'm sure. I thought you left. I just wanted to say goodbye to you. I got a proposition for you. How would you like to earn yourself a whole closet for the eyelashes? Are you going to do a two-page feature on me? No. Well, what do I have to do? You're going to do a feature on my Uncle Nick. Morning, Nick. You read my magazine, Uncle Nick? I only read stock rotations. Yeah. Yeah, I like that one. Looks like a painting. Was a real crash job. Had all the presses to lock it in. Surely, kind of sick, though. Someone blew her brains out. Maybe Charlie is out. Maybe somebody's paying him money. A contract. Uh, this is just between us. Like always, Kid. Hello. I brought you a present. Very nice. If I hear anything, I call you. I'll go unwrap my present. You have a seat, please. We've been working with your father. We've been working on an assignment. Something's wrong? Your father is dead. How? He was killed serving by the agency. Your father working to save so many lives. You can be proud of your father's. I'll find out how. And I'll find out who did it. And when I find out who did it... I swear to you... I'll see them dead. With or without any help I'll see them dead. I am sorry, Cath. Okay. John, Bremen here. I have some good news and bad. No, the intercept went fine. The bad new is our light is out. We're sort of at the crossroads. The next thing we'll know will be nuclear blackmail. I understand, Sir. Top priority. When can we meet? Right, Sir. John, how are you? Busy as hell and on the run. Coffee? No, thanks. Our leads point to the shipment of private machine parts from one of the plants. Nothing points to D'Apollito. And my guess is it was a hell of a lot more than chemicals, or machine parts coming out of those plants. Is there any chance of tying the dead girl into the scheme? Get yourself a shot to raid one of his main plants. If we hit the plants too soon or at the wrong time, we'll just shut him down, without getting the proof we need. Did the girl give you anything before she was hit? The old man stays very isolated but we did get something on Shannon. D'Apollito is very concerned about his staff. Doesn't even trust his own son. Have you seen one of these? Is that much our business? Very much our business. The photographer publisher, Shannon D'Apollito. With the girl down, do you have anyone to pick up the ball? I do, but I need your permission. Not one of our people, then I take it. Oh, no, Sir. Vallone in fact. Vallone is dead, Harry. I am talking about his daughter, Catherine Blanch Vallone. Jesus, that's bloody risky, Harry. Same family? Well, the hell that it is. She's determined to become involved whether we want her to or not. If you can't keep her out of it, best you can do is cover her. Watch her closely for everyone's sake. She's no dummy. I mean if we let her work she's liable to turn up something for us. She's anything like her old mean. Vallone was a good man, Sir. Not bad. Not bad at all. My daddy taught me that. Now you were telling me about the lights in China. Ask her. Would you like a job, Cath? A very hazardous job? You're damn right I do. I meant what I vowed about daddy. With or without help. Do you like it? Wonderful. Yeah. Who? Shannon. This is what you do? I am model part time. The rest of time I am a student. I love foreign men. Hey, Nick. You seem to have bounced back nicely after that little incident at the warehouse. We try. I was looking. Tell me, how much for these AK-47's? $1,200. $1,200? Fike here tells me 11. That's what I was told. Come on, you can do a little better than that. Hey, look. Fresh pack, free pack. Extra clips, straps, even the knife. What do you want? $1,200. What about those detonators? They are on the way to the camp. Excellent. Excellent. Want to join the party? Sure, why not. Max, how are you doing? Yes, this is Cath. Hey, listen I need a favor. You know that 8/9 color photo that you have on the wall? Right, I need to borrow that. I need a deliver today. Thanks, okay. 6-40, Meredith Lane. You got it? Please, Max, it is really important. Yes, this is Shannon. I want you to run a quick check on somebody for me. No, it's got to be today. Okay. Catherine Blanch Vallone. V-A-L-L-O-N-E. If I sent my photo, and my resume called him later on and yes, he would be delighted to see me. He's having an appointment with me at three. Okay, but don't go too fast to get to it. Take your time. Have a few lunches with Shannon before you make a move. There's a hit man on the loose by the name Charlie. He's got a lot of aliases, but he's mainly known as "Cocoa" Charlie. Did he have anything to do with the assignment that my father was working on? Our connection's possible. But he's a nasty son of a bitch. Cunning as hell. If you get ever across, you can never be too careful. I swear if he was involved, I'll blow his brains out. Talk like that is going to get you in a nasty situation. Yeah. Bremen? Shannon. This will be the last time you ever hear my voice, so listen carefully. My Miss August is been keeping close contact with one of my father's lieutenants. This is her report. "Overheard a conversation between D'Apollito and Julius. "You had another one of those letters. "D'Apollito to Julius: "Bring in some of our investigators from the East Coast. Work them into the staff. I am going to clean the house. "Again D'Apollito to Julius: "You're supposed to be in charge of security. "If this business is going to cost me another dime, it's coming out of your hide." I tell you what it means to me, Bremen. It's extortion. A shakedown. They're probably on either one of us. They probably think is one of my girls who's milking the information out of one of the customers. So they'll shoot one. Maybe more. Now Miss August is missing. I found this report in her apartment. Look, that's it. I'm out. I'm through. Don't send any more of your people around here and don't call me for anything. Shannon. Here's where it gets interesting. When I spoke to Shannon D'Apollito, he told me he was through he didn't want to have anything more to do with us. But not before he gave me some very valuable information. The girl you're replacing might have been killed because she was suspected of extortion. You and I both know she wasn't guilty. Which means someone else is. Shannon? Not altogether impossible. But they may know the very thing we're trying to find out. What's that? The details on the illegal underground weapons market and how D'Apollito was tied into it, if in fact he is. So, find the extortionist and you'll find the information. You must exercise extreme caution. You cannot be too careful. There's one dead girl already and if Shannon's info was correct, there might be two. Someone he called the Miss August. What about Nicholas Julius? What do you think? Uncle Nick is unapproachable. You can't get a hook in, he's a bit of a king though. Keep this with you at all times. A lighter? It's a tracking device and a very effective two-way radio. Okay. Yeah, that's what I like about my job. What do you like about yours? Meeting interesting and important people like you, Mr. D'Apollito. Okay, give me a little bit smile there. That's good. I love meeting celebrities. Which is what my father uses influence to get me on Miss Magazine. He's a lawyer in Century City. Try me again. This time in english. Let's do something with that chair over there. There you go. I ran your name with a place right down the street. And what I get is that you had a playboy papa. Really traveler. A LA Hemingway. He died and left you with an empty bedroom. He were no lawyer, love. In english, that's bull crap. What is it you really want? I would like that job done at Miss Magazine. I thought if I had an interview with you it might make it easier. So I did some rye eyes on you. Are you upset? No. Do you know a man named Charlie? Charlie who? Got to get him up. We have company. Meet Detective Peters. Hello. Hello. Shh! Do you want a drink? Oh, no, thanks. Hello, this is Tiger speaking. Give me a fast run down Detective Peterson, local police. Let's take it from the beginning. The girl on the out skirts of town I'll try to remember everything. There's nothing to remember. I drove her up. Took some pictures. Drove her back. IT's a short story. Good man. Nice tan you have Detective Peterson. I work hard to keep me in shape. I can see that you do too, Miss...? Miss Cath Vallone. Look, Peterson, it's getting late. If you don't mind, if there's any more questions can we get on with it? You don't look after your girls very well, do you? I think it's time I should leave. Are you one of Shannon's girls, Miss vallone? I'd like to be. I'd sure think twice about that if I were you. That's a slender statement. Good night, Peterson. If you have anything more to say, you'll have to speak to my attorney. I talk as little as possible. Junior. I'll be in touch. Uh, Cath. This is confidential. Can you keep it that way? Do you mind if I get that interview? I like that girl. Tiger Yang, the report is ready. Detective Waldo Petersen plain close division. On special assignment. Working with the detective copeland and detective white, investigating recent murder a suspect by the name of Charlie chalice alias "Cocoa" Charlie. I just hope that this Peterson is as inept as it sounds. We don't want the cops to get Charlie before we do. Feel like the lesson try, my friend? Sure, why not? Let's go, have a look at D'Apollito's plant tonight. See how tight the security is. Great, we can check the weapons the radioactive chemicals, too. There it is. We got the tranquilizer gun and if we have any real trouble, I've got this. I have my own tranquilizer. Well, Detective Peterson. What took you so long? Traffic. I want to talk to you. I suppose you stopped out for a search warrant? I never bother. That's my father. An idol of yours? No, he was no god. More like a devil. We got along famously. I painted that one. Very nice. I am tired. It's getting late. I need my sleep, okay. I don't like playing games. I know about you and Bremen. And I know about you... And Tiger. And I know about you and the agency. And D'Apollito. I know what you're looking for. Would you like me to blow your cover? Huh? Shall I leave? I don't even want to hear you breathe. Take it off, Baby. Or I'll rip it off. Cath, are you alright? How do I look? Dead or alive? Did you fight? No. You were assaulted? I were. You need a doctor. I heed to be left alone. Who did this, Cath? Cop. Five minutes and I'll be downstairs. Wait for me there. Sit down and relax. He might just as well have held a gun on me. He knows everything. He blackmailed you. Yeah, I guess in so many words he did. Who was it? Detective Peterson. I thought you'd know that by now. Incredible. Yeah, indeed. Incredible. Let's find if he is. You take care, okay? Ciao. I thought I told you to keep this stuff covered up. Can I keep everything around here? Just do what he says. Alright? Alright. What did police say? I didn't call them. What would they going to do? Give me a band aid? A telegram for Miss Cath Vallone. Yes, that's me. Okay, Sian here. "Have information of 'Cocoa' Charlie and your father. "Meet me at 11:20, West Dixon at six P.M. Take a chance." Detective Peterson. What time is it? Ten thirty. I have an appointment at 11. To fix Peterson? Yeah, I fix Peterson. Okay, Dee-Dee, loose the left strap. What about circulation? That's it. Okay. Where are you in comparison...? With your... Competitors? We're up on the news stands now. Subscriptions are gaining. What about Charlie? How's he doing? Who's Charlie? You asked me yesterday if I knew a man named Charlie? Don't know the man. About your friend Detective Peterson. Is he going to throw you in jail? I don't know him either. I was raped by a man named Peterson. I met him here, remember? I guess he followed me home. Shannon, are you going to concentrate on me or not? Go get your clothes on. We're through. So are you. He went crazy when I told him about Peterson. That's when I got boots. By the way, your Detective Peterson is dead. What? Don't ask me. I don't know how to work it out. A simple police detective completely blows our cover. God knows how many other people know about us. Peterson buys the farm, "Cocoa" Charlie is on the loose. I don't know, Cath. I think it's just the time to close this story and go home. I don't like it. Do you think I do? So it's over? And done with. It will be a while until we get another shot at D'Apollito, too. Well, I can't say I am sorry for Peterson. Who is going to get another go out? So I thought. Got riddance. Good Charlie, huh? It was probably Charlie who did it. Look, Pritchard's going to London tonight. Tiger and I are going to meet him with the Pan Am VIP Lounge. We're going to go over everything up to now. What are you going to do? I don't know, I hadn't thought about that. Well, I have. I want you to get out of town until the things get cool off a while. Here's an airline ticket and some fun money. My compliments. The agency thanks you, Cath. We hardly got to know each other. Another time. Goodbye. Hello, Blake. Oh, Nick. Doing a deal yet? Look, Blake, I know we had our differences. But I want to make a deal. Yeah, for the detonators? Not exactly. No deal, Nick. A guy named Fike has them. Maybe Fike's the guy you should be making the deal with. Give me your word you'll cut me some slacks when the time comes. I see what I can do. Let me tell you something, Nick. You bring me those detonators, put it in my hand, then we talk deal. Until then you stay out of my face. Yeah. Okay, Blake. Speak to me. What's that supposed to mean? There was a delay. Okay, okay, I am on my way. Yes I need a number to Pan Am, VIP Room at Cannon International please. Let me see the file oh "Cocoa" Charlie. I got it right here. I need to speak to Mr. Bremen or Mr. Yang. Are they there? An oriental or a tall bald man. Please hurry. Excuse me. What the hell is all about? This is Bremen. Peterson called. Don't be ridiculous. He's dead. I am telling you, it was Peterson. I'd know his voice anywhere. He was wondering why I wasn't there and I'm going to meet him. Listen, stay where you are. We'll be there in 15 minutes. You told me this was a hazardous job. He won't wait. I am leaving. Cath... you have the address. I'll see you there. That was Cath. She said she just got a phone call from Peterson. Peterson's dead. Yeah but she swears it's his voice. And she's going to meet him now. Get on it. You know the address? I still have the telegram. Wait a minute, Guys. I'll be here for one more hour. I have my brief phone, so keep me in touch. Hello. Detective Peterson? I told Cath to stay put. Peterson? I had things to do. Sure you had things to do. Bullshit, that's what you had to do. You was seen on Olive Street. What are you talking about? Remember this. Fike saw you there. It wasn't me. Fike made a mistake. No mistakes. You was seen talking to Blake. I am telling you it wasn't me. I sure as the hell it was you. I've seen you. Come on, he's lying. I don't want to hear it. You know me, I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize this operation. Fike's making it all up. He's trying to take over. He wants my job. Oh, Cath. Cath. We are on our way to D'Apollito's House. Meet us there with back up. No back up available for approximately ten minutes. Do what you can. Do you want to wait for back up? What do you think? I wait for no one. Let's do it. I always suspected Nick. I knew fro the beginning what he was up to. Anyway, you did a good job. Okay, Kid. Let's see how fast you can think. I work for your papa. I eliminate people. Who am I? What makes you think I'll fall for that crap, Peterson? Do you think I wouldn't recognize you without those phony disguises? Charlie. There it is. Alert. Alert. Car approaching fast. Two men inside. Mario, do what you can to stall them off until fike and I grab some weapons to get the hell out of here. Middle of the house. Alert. Incoming attack. They've got tunnels running from here to the earth field they're keeping a small plane there. Meet me. Open the trunk! Get a couple of uzi's and AK and let's get the hell out of here. Get some ammo. That was for Cath. Here it is. The camp is located right here. It's pretty remote. We have one C1-41 standing by, we have the permission from that government to land. From there you'll be lifted into the mountains. The last four miles is on foot. Any questions so far? How much time do I have? The C1-42 can set in country 24 hours. It doesn't give you much time, does it. Enough. Killfast Operation. We want the camp destroyed. But more important, we must have those two detonators back. You are sure they are there? Yes. Then I will bring them back. Another thing. Even a hint that we're involved in this operation could cause an international incident. There will be casualties. I am not interested in politics, Gentlemen. Sorry, Tiger. This operation wasn't part of our original deal. When do we leave? Tomorrow morning. 04:30. Good luck, Tiger. My honor, my obligations. Chief, I see moving by eight clicks out. Hey, men, look alive. Got something coming in on the scanners. Get those nets out. Get everything covered. You got to expect it when you're on the move. Respect, Sir! There's the camp. Killfast. Get the detonators. Sir! Come on. What's the status? We're picking up activity out there. Was eight clicks out not two. He's one of them, kill the son of a bitch. Yes, Sir. He's finished. If I were you I'd stick with him. Right. Use code red until that package is delivered. Ten four. If am not in 15 minutes, let it blow, understand? Is this what are you looking for? Here she is. Here are the detonators. Good job, Tiger. The country is proud of you. Tiger... Have you ever been to South America? South America?
