History vindicates us, and you know it. History vindicates no one. History's a deaf man answering questions he wasn't asked. Words, words. History doesn't lie, Lola. You're relying on someone who can't help you. Who do you mean? Remember: Either God wants all evil to disappear. . . but can't do it, which means He's weak. . . or He can but won't, which means He's evil. Or He can't and won't, so He's weak and evil. . . and therefore not God. Unde malum? That's Epicurus. He's interesting, but of no use to me. That trilemma leads to intellectual paralysis. In fact, God isn't weak or strong, good or bad. He's nothing. I don't follow you. - I presume you know the Bible. - Shit, Lola, I'm a pro! Let's see: Exodus 3:14. "And God said unto Moses, 'I am who I am.'" "Tell the Israelites: 'I have sent you to them.'" No, he said, "Ehyeh asher ehyeh." "I shall be who I shall be." You had a bad translation. He used the future tense. God is coming. That's my only hope. Bullshit! Save that for dating or impressing your egghead friends. It's much simpler. To me you're like an olive to a dry martini. - Necessary but dispensable? - Exactly. - Where are you going? - We're expected. The way I see it, you can't win. Maybe. Anyway, Lola dear, why keep fighting? I have my principles. Shit, I was afraid of that. EARTH HELL HEAVEN DON'T TEMPT ME HEAVEN, 2 months earlier MARINA D'ANGELO, Operations Manager for Heaven Things aren't going well. I can't deny it. In recent years, few souls have deserved to reinhabit their bodies. Worse, I doubt the trend will change. If it continues, we'll have to surrender. . . and admit the rebels have won. THE CATCHER IN THE RYE J. D. SALINGER Did you manage to talk to Him? No, I didn't. You've been here long enough to know nobody ever does. Sorry, I'm a bit edgy. I tried hard. But no one knows where He is. They say He's tired, depressed. . . and wants to drop everything. But don't worry; it's just rumors. We have to solve this problem alone. Any ideas? I have good news: We've had an application. Who from? A mother. That's good. You're a big hit, Lola. They adore it. Be quiet. They're not clapping. Listen! They've stopped clapping. Lola, they clapped for 10 minutes. What more do you want? It wasn't 10 minutes. Good evening, Lola. Sorry to interrupt, darling. If I'd known you were coming-- Alas, I got here at the end. But that last song is fantastic. - So romantic! - You like it? I'd never sung it before. It's a new number. Don't you think they stopped clapping too soon? No, they left delighted. Audiences adore you. I'm not sure. The first day on tour is the hardest. Lola, you have to cancel all your next appearances. Why? A mother wants us to save her son's soul. CHECKPOINT CHARLIE. Gateway to Hell. Southern Zone. JACK DAVENPORT, Operations Manager for Hell Hi, Manny. Did you win? No. Never once since you left. I'm back, but if you hit me again-- I'm so glad you're back, Lola! FOR MY SON, MANNY 22nd CIRCLE OF HELL Now we've dealt with our grandparents. . . It's back to the 21st century, Idiot! Aren't you hungry? I saw the doctor this morning. He said I have to give up boxing. I'll get it. Dear nephew, I have to ask you a favor. I haven't seen you in ages, but your cousin Carmen-- Don't you remember me? I'm your cousin Carmen. You've really changed! Don't I get a kiss? Sure. I'll help you. come on in. My cousin Carmen, she's staying with us a few days. Take it easy. I don't want to scare you. Amazing, how you've changed! No one would know you're the same person. . . from this photo. I'm not the same person. Fifteen years have gone by. As a kid, Manny taught me boxing. Right, cousin? Tuck your elbows into your body. You forgotten what I taught you? Stop being an idiot! The doctor has forbidden me to box. Says I got something in my head. Shit, Manny! What a shame, man. I really wanted to see you box again! Fuckin' shame! Where do I put it? - In one of the albums. - Where are they? In the closet. Put it in the green one. There's room in front. You won't last five minutes. Don't forget to tuck in your elbows. "If you ever hear one of her staff say. . . "'I'm away, sick, or tired'. . . "use this key and follow my instructions, Signed, Jack Davenport." How's my mother? She was fine last time I saw her. Had a hard time getting around, but lively as ever. I haven't seen her in seven years. Sure. Did she mention me? Well, no. . . she didn't. She's never mentions you since you left. Never? Never. What is it? If you've hurt someone you really love. . . how can you be forgiven? Talk to her. I can't. She doesn't live here. Then write her a letter. I've never written a letter. Then do something so she feels proud of you. Something that shows you've changed. Then she'll forgive you. How will she find out? Sooner or later she'll find out, don't worry. - You sure? - I'm sure. What can I do? 1,400. Every day we get out 10 minutes later because of her! Good evening. Your new supervisor: Miss Carmen Ramos. She's in charge of the cash registers. Shit! She looks like a top model! Wait! Is this paid as overtime? I hope so. I wish it could be, Antonia. But you know verifications don't count as overtime. So the sooner we start, the sooner we'll finish. Let's go! She's much too pretty, Eduardo. I know, but she had excellent references. She agreed to cut her salary in half. Isn't her skirt too short? Yes. But we're not her husband, just her bosses. It's my first day, so I'll spare you long speeches. I know you're tired and want to get home. But before you leave. . . I want to share an idea with you. If coworker Lola. . . can bill almost twice as much as the others. . . we're doing something wrong. So we all have to figure out. . . what it is. Okay, girls, I won't bother you more. Good night. See you tomorrow. Congratulations, Lola! Gotta be with it, Lola! Wanna fuck, babe? Sorry, lady. I found it in a magazine. Figured you'd like to have it. Handsome. . . Help Lola set the table. I don't like women lazing around. Go in the kitchen. I'll get it. What's that? Tijuana. . . I KO'd him in the fifth. That's all over. You've gotta think of the future. But the future isn't what it used to be. These folks want to talk to Manny. Sorry to bother you so late. It's an urgent matter. Fine, but if it's about a fight-- It's nothing to do with boxing. A drink? Thanks, we had coffee in the bar downstairs. I can't pay you now. You'll have to wait until tomorrow. I'll call the police. Don't bother, lady. Does it turn you on? What's gotten into you? Let's go. Dirty bitch. I can still do it. Your husband owes me over $25,000. . . plus interest. I didn't know. - I can't pay you that sum. - Mortgage your apartment. It's a rental. Get a loan on your salary. It's the only way. I'll do that. I'll apply for a loan. I'll give him another 15 days. Banks are so slow. I'm doing it for you. I've given up on Manny. He let me down. He hung out with bums and didn't train. Look, Daddy! They're excited about their first communion. Go change. Don't dirty your dresses. My pretties! Fifteen days. Okay? Did it go okay? Yes, it's settled. I'll ask the bank for a loan to repay your debt. Look at all those hopeful novices. One of them may make it big. Why do you owe money? They gave me some stolen jewels to sell to a friend. - And? - I sold them, but. . . I spent the money. How did you spend $25,000? - On things. - What things? If you hadn't left me-- You've got to change. A lot! - Let's go. - No, wait. It's nice here. I've found you a job at the supermarket. Security guard. I have to wear a uniform? - Of course. - Shit! Please tell your cousin to move out. No, she's my cousin. I'm her godfather, too. You sure she's your cousin? Sure. Who else? Sorry, I didn't hear you come in. Lola wants the bag put away, but if you want to go on-- No, take it down. I was just fooling around. Manny, it's not the end of the world. Sooner or later, you had to quit. Now think of you and Lola. She's so happy about it. It's a weight off her back. It's nothing, shit! A shame you had to quit before winning the championship. But that's life, pal. Yeah, that's life. I'm the greatest! I'm the champ! Leave him alone! He's a poor sap. A poor sap? People have been sentenced for much less. But now he wants to change. I doubt it. And he won't have time. He'll get killed by those cops or by boxing again. Why go to all the trouble? I pity you. You remind me of my father. I'm glad. I'm sure he was a good person. Very good, but he got nowhere. Speaking of good people, want some advice? Sure. Being good is the wrong image for a woman. It's not interesting. Between us, it's not sexy. But it's stylish. There's few of us left. So keep trying. Maybe you'll convince me. I always liked boxers. No, in the town of my in-laws. And you agreed to it? My mother-in-law's a pain. I don't let mine push me around. Something wrong? We don't eat with the bosses. Don't be mean. Stay with us. I'm just another worker, like you. - Anyone seen Lola? - She's not here yet. She's on the later shift. Right, she told me last night. She's my cousin. Actually, she's my cousin's wife. I'm living there for now. She didn't tell us. She's quite shy. Never told me she studied for a year at the university. She's great. So great, so educated? Then why does she work here? For her husband. Not to outclass him. What nonsense! I told you she was tricky. That's so romantic. Listen, Carmen-- May I call you Carmen? Sure. Will they fire me for being pregnant? Over my dead body! I'm a woman, too. Hi. Lola, before I forget. . . I spoke to the manager, and he said Manny can start at once. Her husband's been hired as a guard. What's on for today? Deciding about the pregnant cashier. The specials should be shown better. If she's ever absent, fire her. Find a better reason. We don't fire pregnant women. I want a watchman here permanently. To stop them from eating the yogurts. And not finishing them. Anything else? The cashiers want you to meet with their delegate. - What do they want? - A raise. They can't have a raise. Next topic. In their letter, they threaten protest actions. . . if their demands aren't met. Don't worry. There's plenty of job seekers. No massive firings. Our shareholders are Christian businessmen. . . who don't like bad publicity. Let's fire their delegate! That'll scare the others. Remember what happened in Barcelona. . . when we fired the packers' delegate! They went on strike and paralyzed the store for a month. Women have great solidarity. In that case. . . all we can do is negotiate. Negotiate what? There's nothing to negotiate. We must find another solution. Sir. . . I may have one. What is it? Egonomics. The economic analysis of emotions. I'll write my mom a letter. It's simpler than your other idea. Hurry up. That's a nice knot. Let's see. Tell me. Where did we meet? In Bilbao. . . after the fight. Really? When did we get married? Five years ago. . . That can't be. . . Manny, we got married on May 9, 1997. Which means '97, '98, '99. If you say so. To me, it's like we've been married a week. Manny, don't. You can't be late the first day. Fuck that. What's up, Manny? It's harder than boxing, huh? You're not mad because of the other night? Hey, I only obey orders. Who was that chick? - My cousin. - Shit! She's hot! Mind if I screw her? Just kidding. She doesn't like guys. So watch out for your wife. She studied Psych, sees weirdos all over. Take care of yourself. Remind your wife about the payment. Keep an eye on her, as she said. Mind if I watch TV? There's an interesting movie. I never saw it. I was killed the day before it opened. Do what you want. But knock before coming in. Good intentions. That's the solution to our cashier problem. I read their letter. Their demand for a raise is an excuse. They just want to be noticed. . . to feel part of our project. We forget that affection and human warmth. . . are better than a raise. So I've made a decision. Fire their delegate and talk to them. Show them we need them. . . that they matter to the company as much as us. "Good intentions." It's a great idea. True, good intentions can move mountains, but-- But what? You know the parable of the Good Samaritan? It's one of my favorites. Mrs. Thatcher said no one would remember him. . . if he'd only had good intentions; he also had money. Meaning? We do as the Good Samaritan. We combine good intentions with money. And give our cashiers a raise? Not to all. Only to their delegate. And put her in charge of cash registers. Never! She's a rebel. We must fire her, not reward her. Firing her would be an error. As for rebels. . . deep down they're all conservatives. Once they settle in, they settle down. You may be right. Then who do I fire? When they ask for a raise, we fire someone to set an example. That's no problem. Fire her! But she's our best employee! That's exactly why. The best student is never popular. Fire her. Nobody will raise a finger for her. Firing her won't give us any trouble. Very well. I'll study your proposal and give you my decision. Good. - Let's not fall for that. - Why? It'll create nothing but problems. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. That's a pity. Anyway, she had a brilliant idea. Yes. But in this company, you have to have the good ideas! Anyone got a cash slip? What's up? Can't you see, they'll fire people? - Why? - That letter we signed. You're so silly, talking politics all day. They can't fire anybody for that. And don't believe rumors. You don't think so? They won't fire you. What do you care? I signed the letter, too! Stop playing innocent. We all know. . . you're the cousin of our boss, and she lives with you. We've got jobless husbands, too! Antonia Jiménez, to the personnel office. Don't believe rumors, huh? "Mother, I live in Madrid now. "I'm married. My wife's called Lola. "She's very smart. "She studied. Cousin Carmen lives with us. "I fought in the Spanish championship in 1999. "Now I work in a supermarket. Your son, Manny." What do you think? OK, but you didn't ask to be forgiven. You're right. - There. - Why's your mother mad at you? - That's my business. - Tell me. Why? It doesn't matter. Happened a long time ago. I don't care. Tell me. I stole the money she saved for my brother's studies. I wanted to be a boxer. She wanted me to work. I needed that money to get away. Go mail the letter. Hi, Lola. Carmen in? We're going dancing. She's in her room. - Shit, what a knockout! - Gorgeous! Do I look okay? Yes. If that's what you like. Don't wait for me for dinner. I'll be back late. - We got some. - What? Pllls, of course! I had to come up and see you. I'm choking down there. Don't worry. What's so urgent? I want you to replace me. Why? You're doing fine. No, I'm not doing fine at all. I've lost interest. And-- Because of her, right? I feel strange. . . I'm totally destabilized. You have to replace me. Send another agent, or we'll lose Manny. I can't. We don't have anyone. I can't replace you. Our old agents can't cope down there any more. And the new ones? The new ones are useless. Most got here with outside help. . . not on their own merit. They don't fit in, watch TV all day, and eat hamburgers. It's a disaster. Are things that bad? Worse than you think. Look! - Those were my fans. - That's how it is, Lola. Costs a fortune to keep all this up. The truth is, we're bankrupt. Without radical changes, we won't last another year. You have to find a way. . . to land Manny for us. But Manny's just one soul. I don't see how-- I presume you know about Cleopatra's nose. Sure. An inch longer, and it'd have changed the history of the world. If Manny's soul lands on our side-- this may seem trivial-- we may survive. Don't ask me why: I can't answer you now. Trust me. If you want Manny, we have to change the rules. Or they'll get him. Sorry to bother you. Please sing something for us. We miss you so much. Please! Well. . . What shall I sing? Artists! What are you staring at, stupid? Listen to her! "Mother, Mother. . . "1999. . . I'm working in a supermarket. . . "Your son, Manny. "Forgive me. Forgive me." Shit! What a jerk! Yes? Did you mail the letter? Let's go to bed. Did you mail the letter, yes or no? - Why? - Because. . .that's my business. - You coming to bed? - No! Tell me why you didn't mail the letter! I remembered my mother loved my brother more than me. Okay? Come to bed, or I'll put the bag up again. Sorry, sir. I didn't hear you. I didn't want to scare you. I wanted to be sure it was you. We can't be too cautious. Of course, sir. What's going on? We've got problems. . . This is strictly confidential, okay? It's between us. There's a conspiracy in Hell to replace me. Who are the traitors? Some council members. They think I'm old-fashioned. They want a new form of management. . . to change the rules in their favor. That'd be terrible. I know. That's why I need your help. I'll do what you say. I hate informers and traitors. I know that. That's why I picked you! Look, I need to speak to the cousins. Tell them I need to see Marina D'Angelo as soon as possible. She'll get it. It's about the boxer. For now, forget his soul. Concentrate on his body, just his body. Do anything. But no harm must come to him in the next days. Got it? Fine, but. . . If he died now, it'd be a catastrophe. - You follow me? - Yes, sir, perfectly. If it goes well, I'll promote you to Circle 10. Sir! That's enough. Concentrate on the boxer! It's really important. May I ask you a question, sir? Why is his soul so important? He's a nobody, just an ordinary sinner. Some things that don't seem important. . . can cause big changes. Didn't you read Pascal in school? You remember his theory about Cleopatra's nose? Yes? Good. - See you later. - Good-bye, sir. Excuse me. May I talk to you? I want to talk to you, too. Firing those people was a mistake. Indeed. But it's too late. LETTER OF DISMISSAL Lola, I have to talk to you. Feel better? Can we talk now? Let's try and be pros. I was just obeying orders. All executioners say that! You're like my father. . . always moralizing. There's a rebellion in Hell. To stop it, I'm to help you save Manny's soul. My boss wants to see one of your people. . . Marina D'Angelo. How come you're not with the rebels? I'm not a puppet. Manipulated by VIPs? I know that movie, I'm not so old. . . What if you're tricking me? You have my word. That's not enough. It's a risk you'll have to take. We need your help, and you need ours. It seems to me. . . you're the ones facing a rebellion. But if they win, you'll disappear: a disaster! Come on, Jack. Why do you care about our survival? To keep things balanced. When the hawks have eaten the doves, they'll devour each other. But that's not all, right? Yes. They want to change the rules of the game. I don't get it. They also want to get rid of me. . . and have a plan. - Hell's been fair so far, no? - Yes, sir. We don't care if our inmates, in a former life. . . were pope, king, road sweeper, or banker. They all do their time! But if the rich win, they'll change all that! It's the most dangerous of rebellions! Will the other inmates agree to such injustice? The rich planned this for ages! They've created a world of puppets with TV and propaganda. . . a kind of evil Disneyland where men-- And women, Jack! Sure, men and women. Where men and women are guiltless. . . and not responsible for their acts! I won't stand for it! Oenturies ago, I fought another tyranny! I lost a lot, but I don't regret it. What's more, young lady. . . now as then, I'll risk losing everything. . . so you and others can fight me. . . so you can choose between my ideas and yours. We must be able to choose, right? I don't exist without you, or you without me. We must have that choice even though it's a-- A game played in the dark. A game played in the dark. You remember the night that-- Sit down. Stop drinking. What do you need? The boxer's soul. . . must go over to your side of his own free will. It'll weaken them. I'll show they threaten our survival. That's risky. It's breaking the rules. I know, Marina! But this is a unique crisis! And you owe me a favor. Remember 1939. What happened in 1939, sir? Yes, what happened in 1939? Sorry, we didn't know you had company. Can we come in? It'll only take a moment. - We're a drag, huh? - You are. It's about the bank loan. We didn't forget. Now get out! Sure. How is it? I'll know tomorrow. Dry! Very good. We'll talk tomorrow. I wouldn't have bothered you. But you know wives. Mine wants a new kitchen. This month. Or she'll kick me out. - You understand? - Of course. Tell her she'll get her new kitchen. Tell her also she's married to a pig. But she must know that. No! You know what the boss said. Don't touch those two. What are you into? I'm a businessman. And you? "Businessman." These peons come here and act uppity. Let's see your ID. He's Swiss! I hate "businessmen," especially Swiss ones. You into business, too? Not really. No. Why are you staring at me? You dig me? It's so I won't forget your face. . . if we meet again. What'll you do if we meet again. . . make love to me? See this? I'll ream your ass with it. So you end up in the emergency ward. Women! I knew it was you. And that you had problems. It's a fine novel. It made me cry. Me, too. We're already too old for-- It's impossible. Leave. As you wish. But remember. . . I'll always be yours. . . forever, until Hell-- Until Hell freezes over. I remember, Jack. I remember. Manny, what are you doing? Shouldn't you be at work? I quit, Lola. I'm going back to boxing. You can't. The doctors told you. Doctors never climbed into a ring. I can't stand wearing a uniform. But, Manny. . . Shut up! I've already got my next fight. Tomorrow at 7 a.m., I start training. That's it. Tell him, please tell him. Manny, listen. You can't go back to boxing. Yes, I can. If you do, I'm leaving. Know what the ring's called where I come from? "The stage of the brave." When you're up there, you're somebody. Even if you lose, you're somebody. But when you win-- When you win, then you're a god. You can't understand that. Sure, I do. But you can get killed. So. . . So what? Hit hard, Manny. Left. Left. Two. The whole series. There you go. You're the champ! Left. . . two. Left. Series. Use your legs, Manny. Let's go, five. Don't be a faggot! Now, you come up. - Forget it. I'm not tired. - I want to fight. Be careful. I won't hit his head. We'll see who's a faggot. Come on, Carmen! What did you do? I boxed. You shouldn't have insulted him. I didn't realize it, shit! Is it true you're a big star in Heaven? Yes. And you have lots of fans? I can't complain. We have to talk. Go right ahead. I'm worried. . . you won't manage to live up to your end of the deal. Don't worry, I'll manage. I worry about it a lot. I know you were fired. How do you plan to pay me? I'll pay. - How? - I'll pay you. I hope so. Or things will be rough for your husband. - You understand? - Perfectly, you're very clear. Then we have nothing more to say. See you next week. Nice going, Lola. You've got balls. That's not it. I'm experienced. There's worse than him. He's a beginner. I know human nature. I used to be in politics. Even being in politics, you got into Heaven? It was another era. Shit! If they find out I betrayed them, I won't get back out. It's just a routine control. You'll be fine. How did it go? I got an extension, but I don't have much time left. They suspect me. Go to bed. The fight's tomorrow. - Come with me. - I'll go when I feel like it. Come now, or I'll slug you. You'd better not. What are you staring at? You dumb or what? You cowardly bastard! Shit! I'm sick of being hit! I don't know what's got into him lately. He's become jealous. Come on, Manny! What is it? I came to help him, and I made things worse. You're an angel, not a nun. You're doing a good job. You made him ask his mother to be forgiven. He never mailed the letter. You're kidding? He remembered his mother loved his brother more than him. - You're the boxer's wife? - Yes. He's come to, but there are problems. What problems? I'll be frank. He's living on borrowed time. He has irreversible brain damage. He may hemorrhage at any moment. You played with fire. Letting him box was like premeditated murder. - I'll report it to the Federation. - Can I see him? Not now, he needs rest. - Carmen! - Shit! I know how to get the money. Your schemes will get us nowhere. Listen to me. Holy shit! First, I have to ask for permission. Well? What happened? If it goes well, you won't go back to singing. I was getting a bit dated. And you can't use the escape clause. And if it goes wrong? You know what'll happen. You know the rules. Looks like rain. I wouldn't do it, if I were you. Come on, we both know I have to do it. Manny, don't you like the soup? It must be too salty. Where you going? I have a job interview. "A job interview." Oome here, sit down. - I'm in a hurry. - Sit down! Not there, sit here. - It's no time to-- - Sit here! I've been bad at times. . . but I don't want to harm you. Why do you say that? If you cheat on me with a man, I'll beat the shit out of you. But if you cheat on me with a woman. . . I'll kill you both! You haven't changed. Eat your fish. See? It's not so hard. Your turn. Not that way. What did I do wrong? This is a weapon. Scares the shit out of most people. But the others only get scared if they think you'll shoot. How do they know? From your eyes. They look into your eyes and know it. Watch. Your turn. That's hopeless! Not like that. I don't know what'll happen to you if we fail. . . but I know what'll happen to me. I'll even have to quit waitressing. To punish me, they'll make me. . . the wife of some pig who treats me like dirt. It'll be my fate for 100 years. So grab the gun. . . and think of someone you want to kill. Go on! I never wanted to kill anyone. Sure. I don't believe it. Go on, look into your dark side. On the floor! On your knees! You! Put the money in the bag! Hands on your head! Think of your families. . . that money isn't yours! On the floor! On your knees! On all fours! On the floor! Don't move! Lola, the tape! Hurry! Fast! Hands behind your back! Hi. How's life? Not so bad. And you guys? Well. . . you know the saying. . . "The magic potion is a small promotion." Things'll change. I doubt it. Your attention please. For securlty reasons. . . we've closed the main doors of the supermarket, We ask our customers to lie on the floor. . . and stay there until further notice. Did you do it? Shit, that took balls! I removed the bullets. So we wouldn't harm anyone. Drop your gun! Throw it! Gently or I'll shoot you. Gently. . . I've got one! Come along! Quietly! Don't move! Don't move! I've got one! Move and I'll kill you! Keep still. Lola, what's going on? Lola, can you hear me? Everything's fine. Give me the gun. I can't move. They shot me. I'm bleeding. But you can't bleed. You're an angel! Wow, they're angels! No longer. I became a mortal an hour ago. You fucked up, Lola! Slide the gun over. Come on! It was the only way to help Manny. Fighting evil with evil is punished. Our rules are very strict. Good luck. Thanks. What a crock! That won't get you far. Now go! Try to escape. Your rules must be different. I told you, I'm decent. Go on, grab it. Money's just paper, but it affects people like poetry. Too bad it's always somebody else's. It's not so serious, now. You know what they say. . . Having money is like being a blonde. It's more fun. But not essential. Gimme the rifle. No, gimme the pistol, or I'll kill her. Then I'll kill you. So kill her! Gimme the rifle, or I'll shoot you. You won't shoot. . . and you know it. Maybe I will, and maybe I won't. You decide! Carmen. . . You're bleeding! Come on. Hell is a strange place, Lola. I'll tell you something. The judges who sentence you are perverse. The rich, they turn into bums. . . the famous into nobodies. A gangster like me. . . they turn into a woman. Because it's the worst fate. I wanted to tell you sooner. That's how it is. You mind? I could be your mother! You should see my mother! What's with you? Put it away, son. Stay out of trouble. Now I've told you. . . how does it grab you? It's weird. The two female robbers left through this door. This is the supermarket they held up. The amount they stole is not known. Shots were fired. Here's the Police Chief. Sir, what happened exactly? Where were you? Saving your ass. Shut up, slut! We just heard the two robbers. . . were killed by security guards. May we know the names of their victims? You bastard, you double-crossed us! Shut your trap, you dirty slut. Okay, champ, grab her gun. They're going to kill us! Give me the gun! You didn't tell me you'd kill them. Manny, think! That ain't my thing! Carmen, grab their guns. Come on! Now get going! Manny, you're blowing it all. For a woman who no longer loves you! Lola, obey me for once! Get going! If you let them get away, we'll kill you later. I figured that. . . but I'm a boxer, not a murderer. Get going! He has decided. We must leave. Let's go. Farewell, Manny. Farewell, Lola. Now let's settle it like men! Come on. Come here! I'm the greatest. I'm the champ. Mom. LAW COURTS HEAVEN/HELL Any news? But it's taking a long time. I'm worried. So am I. I think Nancy is suspicious. What are his chances? Fifty-fifty. Your lawyers did a good job. And the judge is a woman. He defrauded his mother. . . and beat up several women. She won't like that. Plus, the man that he killed-- Road rage. It wasn't premeditated. Maybe, but your lawyers. . . fought that tooth and nail. Knowing you. . . you've got an ace up your sleeve. You're right. We've asked the Judge to apply the Thermopylae clause. The Thermopylae clause. Congratulations! Total sacrifice. Wonderful. If I remember correctly. . . it was that same judge who applied it in 1959? You've done your homework, too! WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? THE BARBARIANS ARE COMING. Manny's been saved. He's with the angels. Good. I hope he'll be happy there. We've been saved, too. We're angels again. We must return that money. Shit, no. It's ours now! To spend how we want. . . get drunk, go whoring! You keep it. Were you really in politics? I really was. Incredible. . . Something to remember me by. See you soon. Yeah, see you. Miss, come with us. What's this about? You're accused of stealing a bracelet. - Did you do the hold up? - Of course. Tell us who your accomplice was. - I can't. - Why? I'll never tell you. Tell us nicely, or we'll make you talk. Relax. Go help your wife bathe the kids. She'll thank you. You know the supermarket you held up. . . was a front for counterfeiters. That money's useless to your pal. What do you say to that? You can always trust bad guys. They never let you down. They never change. Wait for me there. Thanks. A ticket to Geneva. Geneva. First class. First. Here we are. Cash or card? Cash, dear. You have to wait five minutes. The computer's a bit edgy today. I'm in no hurry. Carmen, it's not for long. They only gave us three years. It'll go by fast. I'm getting out on Monday. My lawyers made a deal with the judge. As you know, we're influential. Good for you. But when will I see you again? That's up to fate. Let's leave fate out of it. When I'm out, I'll come visit you. Marina owes me a favor. By then I'll be in Circle 10. So what? I'll be a man at last. What if I'm not your type? It's a risk we'll have to take. Guess so. Marina d'Angelo reslgned. . . and in a mildly depressive state. . . Jack Davenport managed to hold onto his job. . . but he knows his future will be dim. He drinks heavily. Manny Chavez is getting used to Heaven. But the laws against smoking, bullfighting, or boxing. . . haven't made it easy for him. He kills time reading Marcial Lafuente Estefania. Lola Nevado gave up singing and went back into politics. Due to the shortage of agents, she was sent back to Earth. . . as a member of an antl-globalization group. . . (nonviolent, of course). Carmen Ramos managed to reach Circle 10. Here's what she looks like now. Lola Nevado and Carmen Ramos (or Tony Graco, her new name). . . haven't met up yet.
