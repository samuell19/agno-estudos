News you see and tempt you with everything that comes from afield!... - Acrimony of those who are spiteful! - What the devil do you have against me, that you won't burn not even at the hands of God the Father?... - So what do you want, mother!? I don't like the fire dying at my hands. It's a bad omen!... - Agueda! Agueda!... My wife. - The days went by... - ...He looks like a wolf crossbred!... - Wolf?! I was raised with them... - In the evening after work... And one night... - No! I don't need help!... - You know Tonio is taking me with you to the highlands?... - You?... Did he tell you that?... - And I wanted it too so as to be closer to you!... - For goodness' sake!... Leave me!... I don't want it!... - ...To me, you are different from all the others!... I want you like I do no one else!... - ...No!... Never!... I'll tell Tonio... and everybody... So that men and wolves may stand against you!... - Have you seen Ruivo?... - No... I haven't. - I've been thinking of taking him to the highlands... I could do with him. Too much so. As far as I'm concerned he'd never stay here nor up there!... - Yes! Yes! Do you think that I don't see it in your eyes, biting for this or that woman? Go on! Say it!... - Are you crazy?!... - Then why are you like that now, when before your face was always bursting with joy? You don't look for me for days on end... - Yes. I'm going with Tonio to the highlands. Just to be where you are!... Aren't you also going?... There you are. If I stayed down here, when would we see each other again?... - Oh, mother!... Hasn't Ruivo come this way again?... - I'm definitely taking him. - Have you ever seen this!? - A thief who little by little has wiped out the best of our flock!... - And who told you that the losses in the flock have been Ruivo's doing? Did anyone see it? - What do you know? - Why do you speak like that?... What do you feel for this man!... - Nothing!... But why do you vilify him for no reason?! The disarray the scoundrel brought here! You are to blame. You! - I went to drink some water... And when I came back... the livestock had scattered... "Moninha" and "Talisca" were in a pool of blood... - And Ruivo's cap was next to them!... - That's a lie! It's a lie! - Here you have him, uncle Simão. Your goat ripper!... - Why did you do such wickedness to me?! - I don't know... It just felt right to me... I was raised with wolves... I don't know who my father was!? - Right or wrong, I'm the one who understands it. Not all evil in the world is done by mountain wolves! - And you're also the son of a wolf!... You, sea-wolf!... And you're staying!... The mountain is for the mountain wolves!... We'll see each other again... when I come back!... - At Easter, folk leave the valley where they spent the winter and go up to the highlands. - And Tonio was leaving for the charcoal burning. - You'll remain here, looking after this. You're bored, Ruivo!... Now all you want is to be by Agueda's side!... - You can be at ease... Tonio has left... - And by the Holy Week the village justice pardoned "Gardunho". - Ruivo!... You have to leave our home before Tonio returns!... - I can't live without you... - You have others over there... Do you think I don't know everything? - Luzia! She and the others have been but the bridge to get to you. - I love you, Agueda!... - Deny that I'm the man for whom you'd turn down Tonio... Agueda! I can see it in your eyes that you're unhappily married!... The fire is always dying at my hands!... Bad premonition!... Bad premonition!... - No! ...I don't want it!... You won't brag about me!... - ...Meanwhile I'll take a look at the curds... - Bring in some light!... - Don't send the girl... You go... He may need some help... Here she is!... Deny it!... Deny what I saw with my very own eyes!... - Liar! Weak woman!... Since he didn't care about you any more... - Holy Mother of God!... Nothing, mother... Three times I set fire to the firewood and three times it died down... I rushed down here thinking something terrible had happened. And for no reason, thank God!... - The following day was Easter Sunday. - The suspicion. - I want to know the whole truth!... Ruivo! Where is Ruivo!? - You know something that no one has the heart to tell me! - Swear you'll tell me the whole truth!... - Oh! Let go of me and I'll tell you everything... - Yes, everything... I know... and everybody knows... - Women have always been weak... And when the devil tempts them... - Tell me... Tell me!... - But after all what business is it of yours? It's my own affair and mine alone! I had a crush on Ruivo?... What is it to you? - Oh? It was with you!?... - Hey, you puny sly fox! What do you want?!... You went up hill... Where there's a woman, the iniquity of men springs to life... - Don't listen to him, Tonio!... - The night came knocking on your door with betrayal inside... - There he goes!... Back to the sea!... - Everything... He knows everything... It was "Gardunho" to have his revenge... I did all I could so Tonio wouldn't believe it. - Hey, Ruivo! So sly and already with your bag on your shoulder?! Did you miss me bad... huh?! - I don't know what you mean... - Don't you? Hey, you rogue! There are only two people to blame here: - You and I! Like two wolves that's how it should be. Sea-wolf! Sea-wolf! Why did you tangle with the mountain wolves?... - The waves are destined to die as foam against the rocks... This digital version corresponds to the photochemical restoration of the camera negative in cellulose nitrate from the 1920s. It was scanned in Ultra HD in 2016 using a safety 35mm internegative struck in 2004. The colours were recreated digitally using a distribution print from the 1920s as a reference. All the work was done at the Cinemateca conservation centre (ANIM). The original score written by António Tomás de Lima for the film, composed circa 1925 and held in the Portuguese National Library, was transcribed and edited by Manuel Deniz Silva and played on the piano by Nicholas McNair. The recording was done at the auditorium of the Lisbon School of Music on 22 and 23 August 2016, under the supervision of João Ludovice.
