[MUSIC PLAYING] Whiskey, please. Yes, sir. Thank you. Pine, Joe, please. Isabelle will do it. Pint, my dear. [PHONE RINGING] OPERATOR: Operator. MAN: Police station, please. Excuse me, sir. Yeah? Uh, may I have a glance at your paper, sir? Thank you, sir. You don't really want to look at that, do you? Hmm? You've got one. Why, I say. Uh, I didn't notice. What's the idea? Uh, nothing, sir. Nothing at all. Oh, yes there is. Come on. What is it? Well, as a matter of fact, sir, I was just thinking that, um... here he is, Sergeant. All right, Barlow. I've got a car outside. What is this? You'd better come along quietly. My name's Matthews, Robert Matthews. It's no good. You're wasting your time, Barlow. I tell you I am Robert Matthews of Durrant Cottage, Tolferro. And the sooner you get it into your head the better I shall like it. If you don't mind, we'll sort that out at the station. Come on. All right. [INAUDIBLE], Sergeant. All right. In you get. MATTHEWS: It is known that the arrest made today in the Cannon at Lou was a case of mistaken identity. Hmm. All that I can say is it's a good job you happened to be around, Inspector. Yes, it is. Never mind it's good copy for you, or whatever you artists use for inspiration. I'll say, it's an incredible likeness. Hmm. How long's he been at large? Two days. What was he in for? Manslaughter. Care for a drink? Well, it'll have to be a quick one. Right. Shan't be long, Morrison. Very good, sir. Nice place you've got here. Yeah, it's not bad. Yes. Come in. Ah, thanks very much. Hello, Mrs. Fenton. I didn't know you were still here. Well, after all you've been through today, sir, I thought I'd stay and see you had a nice, hot meal - when you come in. - Terribly sorry. I couldn't eat a thing. I had a very good meal in Lou. - MRS. FENTON: Oh, did you? - Hmm. At the expense of the police department. Well, I should think so. Escaped convict. What next? I always did say the police were a bunch of blundering idiots. I shall never forget the time that... Uh, this is a friend of mine, Mrs. Fenton, Inspector Clements from Lou. - He gave me a lift home. - How do you do? Least he could do after locking you up all day. The inspector didn't arrest me, Mrs. Fenton. He had me released. Oh, did he? Well, I'm glad there's one with some sense, anyway. Quite a character. Yeah. She's been in Tolferro for over 20 years, but she's still a out-and-out Londoner at heart. - Do sit down, will you? - Thanks so much. And what will you have? Whiskey? Gin? Whiskey, please. MATTHEWS: Soda? Thanks. Sorry I can't offer you a cigarette. That's all right. Have one of mine. No, thanks. I never use them. I wish I could say that. Must save yourself quite a bit of money. Oh, it goes just the same. Here, try an old-fashioned light. Oh, thanks so much. Left-handed, eh? You don't miss much, do you? These yours? Yes. Mmm. Good. Don't know much about art, but I know what I like. That's fair enough. How long have you been here, Matthews? About three months. Wonder why the locals didn't recognize you. They're a pretty half-witted lot. Anyway, I don't go out very much. MRS. FENTON: There's a telegram for you here. The boy's waiting in case there's a reply. Oh, thanks. Excuse me. Hmm. Of course. No. No, there's no reply. Very good, sir. Not bad news, I hope. No. It's just in relation to my... oh, cheers. Cheers. It's all right. There's no reply. Why don't you get a telephone fitted in here? We could have phoned up that wire. I have an appointment tonight. Oh, it's a pity about you. Who's it with, that stuttering girl again? Yeah, go on. Off it. I like the stuttering ones. By the time they say no, it's too late. Off it. What are the chances of Barlow getting away? Very slender. I've thrown a cordon around the whole area. And with a bit of luck, we'll be closing in on him at any moment. You talk as though you were hunting some dangerous animal. I don't know about that. But he's certainly a man with an extra-large chip on his shoulder. Always tried to make out he was unjustly convicted. - Perhaps he was. - Oh, no. What happened? Ran over a man, killed him. Drunk? Yes. He denied it, but we found out afterwards he'd been drinking heavily for weeks. There was a girl involved in the case. Her name never came out at the trial, but somebody testified afterwards that she'd given him up, and that's what started him on the bottle. Hmm. How long had he done? Two years, five to go. Get a few more now. Well, I can't say I blame him. Why? Those few hours I spent in a cell were quite enough for me. If I'd been in for two years, I'd probably have done the same thing myself. Would you like me to clear the table before I go, sir? No, that's all right. I'll do it. Excuse me, sir, but I'm a little bit nervous going out at this time of night with that fellow Barlow hanging around. And I was just wondering... Where do you live? Well, near the Fort Garth Road, sir. It's only a few hundred yards from here, but I would be safer with someone with me. Right, I'll drop you. Oh, that's ever so kind of you, sir. I was attacked around here one night as a matter of fact, sir. Of course, it was many years ago. Really? Mmm, it was awful. He said if I didn't do what he wanted, he'd kill me. And what happened? Well, sir, I'm still here. Excuse me. I'll just go and lock the back door. Well, I must be going. - Sorry about today, Matthews. - Oh, forget it. By the way, as a matter of interest, you might let me know when you do get this fellow Barlow. Certainly. We'll have him by tomorrow morning. You seem pretty confident. INSPECTOR CLEMENTS: I am. I'd like to bet you 2 to 1 and 5 bob that you don't. That's a sporting offer. I'll take you on. Good. Well, I do hope you're gonna be all right here on your own, - sir. - Of course I will. You hear such nasty stories about people being found with their throats cut. Every time you pick up the newspapers, you read about some corpse or other. - Goodnight, Matthews. - Goodnight, sir. See you in the morning. [MUSIC PLAYING] Message for you. Uncle Tom arriving tomorrow night. Hold on. What time is the tide on the seventh? 4:30. Morning? That's right. OK, tomorrow. Incredible. Yeah. It's like looking at yourself, isn't it? At least it will when I've got to clean up a bit. Stay where you are, Matthews. How did you know my name? I saw an evening paper. I like to keep track of the news, especially when I figure in it. I think I ought to warn you, I'm expecting a friend here shortly. He's a police inspector. No. I don't think he'll be coming back tonight. I reckon this is the last place he'll think of looking for me. That's why I'm going to stay. Oh, no, you're not. You think I'm going to hide you? No. I'm going to hide you. If you can be mistaken for me, there's no reason why I shouldn't be mistaken for you. Is there? You're crazy. Am I? MATTHEWS: What you going to do with me? Now, look, Barlow, put that thing away and don't act like a fool. I'm going to tie you up and put you somewhere out of the way. It may be a bit, um, uncomfortable for you. But it shouldn't be for more than a week. Got any rope? No. No, there's none here. Now, look here, Barlow... All right. Some sheets will do. Let's go upstairs. Come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] Matthews. [EXPLOSION] [HORN BLOWING] [THUNDER] [PHONE RINGING] Hello. We're just pushing off now, sir. The Karmania? Aye, it might be here. Very good, sir. [THUNDER] [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello, Matthews. I'm glad you're still up. Look, a liner's been sunk a few miles out by stray mine. You probably heard the explosion. Yes. Uh, yes, I did. I wondered what it was. The Karmania. Some survivors have just been brought ashore, and I'm getting the local people to put them up overnight. The trouble is, the village is packed full of holiday-makers. You'll help out, I'm sure. Well, I... It's a question of spare rooms, isn't it? How many have you got, two? - Um, yes. - Good man. There's a young girl and a married couple. I'll go and collect them. The inspector will be here in a minute, sir. If you'd like to make yourself comfortable, I'll see if I can find the owner. Thank goodness for a bit of warmth, anyway. Whole things a scandal. MRS. SMYTHE: Well, we're safe. That's one thing. [INAUDIBLE] COLONEL SMYTHE: Well, there doesn't appear be a measure of fuel shortage in this part of the country. Uh, these are two of the people from the Karmania, sir. Oh, yes. Yes, all right. Oh, very decent of you, sir. My name's Smythe. Uh, Colonel Smythe, late Indian army. This lady's my wife. How do you do? Uh, let me take this. I'll be back in a minute, sir. Thank you. Don't mind telling you, sir, that the government is going to hear from me over this. I'll take [INAUDIBLE]. Oh, thank you. Allowing that ship to be sunk when the show's over. Do you know that my baggage was on board? Yes, it's most inconvenient. I'm sure they'll come to realize that. These confounded Germans ought to be forced to pick up all these mines they've left all over the place. Yes, well, I'll dry these things off for you. COLONEL SMYTHE: [SNEEZE] [MUSIC PLAYING] INSPECTOR CLEMENTS: Miss, Farrington, Mr. Matthews. How do you do? Some of the cottagers will help out with the rest, Matthews. If you could just find a room for Colonel and Mrs. Smythe. I'll... I'll show them in a minute. I'll get rid of these and... Well, come and sit down, my dear. Get yourself warm. Yes, come along. Thank you. Were you traveling alone, Miss Farrington? Yes. Awful embarrassing, you know, butting in here while people are having a meal. Perhaps Mr. Matthews could find something for you to eat. Oh, couldn't manage a thing myself. Could you, my dear? I'm not hungry. If you'd like to come with me, I'll show you your room now. Oh, thank you very much. And thank you, Inspector. You won't forget to inquire about my baggage, will you? I'll look into it at once. Seven years, sir. You would have thought they'd have managed to clear 'em all up in seven years, wouldn't you? Hector... I shall certainly right to the Home Office. The undersecretary's a great friend of mine. I was at school with him, you know. How's the ankle? Oh, it's nothing. It's a bit swollen, but I'm lucky to be here at all. That's the lot, sir. Coastguard seems to think there'll be a pretty heavy casualty list. How many missing? There are 23. We'll look in at the doctor's for you on the way back. Oh, I'm sure it's not necessary. Make sure there aren't any bones broken. Tell him to come in the morning, will you, Sergeant? - Very good, sir. - All right. I hope we're not turning you out of your room, old chap. That's all right. Is there anything you want? No, thanks. We got everything we wanted at the station. - Good. - Goodnight, old chap. - BARLOW: Goodnight. - Thank you. Awfully decent of you. I'll arrange transport for these people in the morning. This lady seems to have sprained her ankle. I'm getting the doctor along. Thanks for everything, Matthews. That's all right. INSPECTOR CLEMENTS: You know, there's something wrong somewhere. Is there? Yes. That ship was a transport during the war. Carried thousands of troops, came through without a scratch. And she gets sunk in peacetime by a million-to-one chance. Seems all wrong, doesn't it? Yes, it does. Well, goodnight. Hello, John. John. I think you're mistaking me for someone else. My name's Robert Matthews. I'll see if I can find a bandage for your ankle. Is it hurting very much? No. Excuse me. [MUSIC PLAYING] Good morning. Good morning. Is there anything I can do? Well, start the coffee if you like. I've laid the table for breakfast. Can you find everything? Oh, I expect to. Were you looking for something, sir? Huh? I hear you had some excitement here last night. Did you hear that terrible explosion? Yes, I, uh... we've got some of the people here. I... I was wondering if we had any cigarettes. Cigarettes? Oh, no, sir. You gave away the last that you had. Don't you remember? Oh, yes. Uh, I'll have to get some, then. Oh, I shouldn't bother, sir. Now they expect you to provide cigarettes for them. Oh, well, uh, I'll see to the breakfast, sir. I, uh, owe you an apology. Why? Mistaking you for someone else. Oh, that's right. I suppose we've all got a double somewhere. I've just read about what happened to you yesterday. You see, I was to have married the man you were mistaken for. Did you know he was in prison? Oh, yes. I knew that. I didn't know he'd escaped. It's uncanny. Not only your looks, it's your voice, your whole manner. In every way, you... you are John Barlow. I'm sure if you saw us together, you'd realize he's quite another person. I wish I could see him. Hmm. There's not much you can do about it right now, is there? Now that he's free, there's a lot I could do. If I could find him, I could help him. Would he want you to? Why not? Oh, I don't know. It depends on how much you meant to each other, how much he meant to you. I... I think a great deal. You think? I know. When did you see him last? Six months ago. Do you love him? Yes. I love him. Oh, hello, Matthews. How are you this morning, hey? So, is this the casualty? It's not too bad, Doctor. A strained muscle, I think. Now, then, we'll just take a look, shall we? Sit down, my dear. Thank you. BARLOW: Chair, Doctor. Thank you. Mr. Matthews bandaged it up for me. Did he? Oh, quite an expert job. I thought you told me you weren't much good at this sort of thing. Left-handed men are a bit awkward as a rule. I had an uncle who was left-handed, always made a terrible drama out of everything. Some things he simply couldn't do. All fingers and thumbs, he was. Now, no, there are no bones broken. But you've sprained a ligament just a wee bit. Try not to use the foot more than you can help for the next two days, at least. Oh. I did want to get back to London. You must leave it till tomorrow or the next day. Mr. Matthews won't mind putting you up for a couple of days, I'm sure. Now then, keep this bandage tight. And rub in a... a little embrocation. Oh, good morning, Mrs. Fenton. Good morning, Doctor. - Sleeping any better, Matthews? - Yes. Uh, much better. Go easy with the sleeping draft. Let me know when you want another prescription. Yes, all right. Nasty business, that last night. They say it wasn't a mine at all. What was it? Well, they seem to think it was sabotage. The explosion took place in the hull. Oh, that's the rumor, anyway. And there's never any smoke without fire, hey. Well, I must be off on my rounds. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. ANN: What a nice man. Yes. Yes, he is. What's his name? Um, Doctor... That's our Dr. Wilson. He's a real gentleman. Nothing's too much trouble, doesn't matter what you are or where you are. Oh, well I'm starting to grate. Breakfast's all ready. Just give me a shout if you want anything. Morning, Matthews. Good morning. Wife will be down in a minute. Afraid we're being an infernal nuisance. Oh, no. No, not at all. Awfully decent of you to put us up like this. By gad, that was a nasty affair last night. Believe me, sir, government's gonna hear about it. Seven years, sir. You'd have thought they'd have managed to clear 'em all up in seven years, wouldn't you? Papers arrived yet? BARLOW: I... I haven't seen them. Well, what time do they usually come? Huh? Oh, uh, about 9:00. Excuse me. Well, my dear, how's the foot? Better, thank you. Good. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh. I'm trying to get some wood to start the fire. You haven't got the key, sir? Isn't that the one? To one of the other sheds. I thought it might fit. I could have sworn I left the one belonging to this in the lock. Well, I suppose it'll be around somewhere. Well, I've got a few scraps. I'll just make do. [MUSIC PLAYING] Morning, my dear. Good morning. Clothes a little odd, Hector? Don't be absurd, woman. Of course they are. I must say, you do look rather funny. I feel funny. Reminding me of it isn't going to help me to feel any other way. Wonder this fellow Clements is coming. Clements? Yeah, police fellow. Said he was gonna arrange transport for us. Ah. - Good morning, Mrs. Smythe. - Good morning. Oh, he mention what time to you, Matthews? Who? Oh, Inspector Clements. Um, I think he said about 9 o'clock. Oh, nearly that now. Hope he isn't late. - Are you in a hurry to leave? - Hurry? I should say I am. Can't get away quick enough. And the first thing I'm going to do is to see my MP... conservative, of course. He'll put a few questions through. Coming back, sir? Yes. I may be back before you leave. Got all you want? Yes, thank you. Yes. Good. If you'll drop me off at the farm, sir, I'd like to get a report from Jenkins. You better extend the cordon as far as Lou. I should think he'll be doubling his tracks by now. Looks as though he's trying to break through to Churo. Aye, it does, sir. Walk on to Durrant cottage when you finish, will you? I'll see you there in a few minutes. Yes, sir. All right. Morning, Matthews. Good morning. - Care for a lift? - No. No, thank you. Come on, get in. We're going to your cottage. All right. That's funny. I thought you said you didn't smoke. No, I... I don't very much. I just fancy one now and again. Could have sworn I brought mine with me. Thank you. I'm afraid you won your bet, Matthews. Bet? Yes you hadn't forgotten, surely. Uh, no, no. Of course not. Two to one at 5 bobs, I think you said. Here you are. - Oh, thank you. - May I come in? Uh, yes. - Good morning, Inspector. - Morning, Inspector. Morning. The doctor come? ANN: Yes, he did. Good. I called in to tell you the arrangements. I'm sending a car to take you into Lou to catch the 11:15 for Paddington. Excellent work, Inspector. Oh, thank you. Miss Farrington's staying until tomorrow. Is that so? Oh, I'm sure it's not necessary. It must be very inconvenient for you. Oh, no. That's all right. The doctor thinks that she ought to rest the foot for a couple of days. No news of my baggage, I suppose? I'm afraid not. Pretty bad, you know. I must admit our main concern has been for the unfortunate people who are still missing. Yes, certainly. I should... quite so. Well, I think I'll just take a sniff of sea air. Coming, my dear? No, thank you. I've had enough sea air to last me for a very long time. Don't mind if I borrow this, do you, old chap? Might see my baggage floating in. Anything wrong? No. No, nothing at all. Would you like a cup of coffee, Inspector? Oh, thanks very much. Matter of fact, I arranged to meet my sergeant here. Uh, if you don't mind, that is. No, of course not. Excuse me, sir, but I've looked for that key everywhere, and I'm sure I left it in the lock. Oh, it'll be around somewhere. We... we'll look for it later. MRS. FENTON: Very well, sir. [MUSIC PLAYING] By gad. [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING] Thank you, sir. I've got a radio message, sir. They've picked up a man near [INAUDIBLE].. They're pretty sure he's Barlow. Good. We'll be off. Don't break the cordon till I've seen him. Very good, sir. There you are. If you'd like to give me a ring in about an hour, I'll give you the latest gin. Thanks. I'd like to hear it. Oh, excuse me, sir. Hmm? Haven't had very much opportunity before, sir, but I owe you an apology. What for? For taking you in for this fellow Barlow. Oh, yes. Yes, of course. You're the sergeant who arrested me in the pub, aren't you? That's right, sir. It really is a most remarkable likeness, sir. You really might be him. As far as I'm concerned, Sergeant, the incident is closed. Thank you, sir. Enjoy your walk, Colonel? I didn't go far. Bit nippy out on the cliffs. Oh, uh, Matthews, I found this in your coat pocket. Luger, hey? Thought you might wonder where it had got to. One chamber fired. Yes. I, um... I'm pestered with rats around here. I always carry it. I hope it didn't frighten you, Colonel. Frighten? Me? Don't be absurd, sir. Nice job, the Luger. Pick it up during the war? Yes. I hope you get the right man this time, Inspector. Yes, I hope so. I'd like you to stop off at the office and check on that gun. Number's XY23971. Luger. Hmm. Just in case. Ticket, please. What time will we get to Falmouth? 3:32, sir. Here you go. Mr. Pritchard? Yeah. I'm a friend of your brother's. He said you'd be able to help me. We were together some days ago. Could we talk somewhere privately? Come inside. Pritchard around, Bill? I'll go see. You're lucky, Barlow. There's a ship sailing for South America on the morning tide. Skipper's a man I do business with. But it's gonna cost you money. How much? 300 pounds. Hmm. Do you think he'll wait until I get straightened up a bit? I know he wouldn't. This sort of thing is cash on the nail. It's risky. I see. I, um... I may have to wait, sir. When does he sail again? Not for several months. Good day, Mr. Pritchard. Good day to you, Constable. What can I do for you? You better have one of these. John Barlow. Haven't they caught him yet? No. Still, there's no knowing where he's likely to show up. No, I suppose not. Well, put it up somewhere, just to remind - you what he looks like. - I'll do that. Good day. Wait a minute. All right. Matthews. Yes? You're supposed to stay in the cottage, aren't you? - Something urgent came up. - Oh, did it? Nothing so urgent as the job we're on. Going back now? Hmm? - Yes. - Oh, come on. Yes, I am. Hop in. I'll give you a lift. What time you get the telegram? Uh, I, uh... CANNING: I expected to hear from you earlier. Ran into a bit of trouble yesterday, didn't you? Yes, I did. Yeah. Gave me quite a jolt when I heard you'd been arrested. This job's getting pretty hot for me. I'd like to get myself a transfer. What do you think about it? Yes, it certainly is getting pretty hot. They'll be watching the coast like hawks after last night. And doesn't help to get Ferrari away. Ferrari? That's the name of our boy. Yeah. Were you following me just now? Sure. As this is probably the last job we'll do together, I'll tell you something. Each time you step out of your cottage, somebody tails you. I must say you've toed the line pretty well. Thanks. Still, it's been worth it for the money you've picked up. You've got a nice piece of change coming to you, haven't you? How much? The usual. Did they park anyone at you from the Karmania last night? Yes, they did. But, uh, I expect they'll have gone by now. All of 'em? Except a girl. Get rid of her. I'll be with you at 11:00. I'll drop you at Rick's Corner. You can walk the rest. Thank you for the tea, Mrs. Fenton. Did you have all you want, dear? Yes, thank you. I can't make out what's happened Mr. Matthews. Did he mention where he was going? No. I do hope he's all right. He's been under the doctor lately. Suffers with his nerves, you know. I think that business yesterday must've upset him. He's been acting quite strange. How do you mean? Well, sort of, uh, remote, as though he's not quite with us. And there's something that puzzles me about last night. What is that? Well, after I left, he must have eaten a whole stew, 3/4 of a loaf of bread, and all his week's cheese ration. He was probably hungry. No, that's just it. He wasn't. He told me he didn't want anything because he just had a large dinner with the inspector. Well, I don't know. Doesn't make sense to me. Thank you very much, dear. Looks as though you're not the only double. Anyone call since I've been out? No. I suppose you're glad about this. About what? Barlow. I'm worried about him, actually. Do you really think he's worth it? He's a criminal, isn't he? No. He killed a man. Doesn't that make him a criminal? It was an accident. Hmm. Why did you give him up? How did you know I gave him up? I didn't. I just guessed by your manner. I'm right, aren't I? I gave him up because I wanted to settle home. John was always a wanderer, and he just couldn't offer me the kind of life I wanted. What time would you like dinner, sir? Oh, about 8:00, I should think. Oh. Well, that's quite late for you, sir, isn't it? Yes. But, um, I may have to go out. Oh, excuse me, sir. I don't want to worry you about this key, but could you force the lock for me? You see, I want a few scraps of wood for the morning. I'll see it's open by the morning. It'll be getting dark... I told you I'll get it open by the morning. Very good, sir. The colonel and his wife wish to be very kindly remembered to you. They didn't leave till quite late after... All right. Thank you. You know, I think you're a fool to worry about him. If he loved you, he'd have settled down. He'd have done anything you asked. Perhaps it was my fault. Maybe I didn't try to understand. At any rate, I blame myself for what's happened now. When I broke off our engagement, he started to drink. I should have known it was an escape. Escape? From me, perhaps. Mostly from himself. He sounds like a man with a problem. Every man has a problem of sorts. What about women? And women. What's your problem? To find John Barlow. Suppose he does want you. He'd have to convince me of that. Ordinary words wouldn't do it. Well, you won't find him here, will you? Won't I? John, don't run away from me. I'm trying to help you. No one can help me. What happened to Robert Matthews, John? [KNOCKING] Come in. Mr. Metcalf, sir. Ah. Sit down, will you? I only just got your message. I been over to Plymouth all day. Sorry to drag you out, Mr. Metcalf. But it's very important. Cigarette? About this revolver that Barlow stole from your place the night before last, was the number XY23971? I'm afraid I don't know. I didn't really look. You see, I didn't have a permit for it. I picked it up in Germany in 1945 and kept it more as a souvenir. Was it a Luger? Yes. If you showed me, I'm sure I can tell you it's mine or not. - [PHONE RINGING] - Maybe. Hello? Yes? Oh, yes. Well, that's something, anyway. Well, I'll be over in a few minutes. Very well, Mr. Metcalf. Thank you for coming along. I... I'm sorry about this permit business. I... We'll discuss that another time. [MUSIC PLAYING] Where are you going? I'm going to try and get the money for you. If I go now, I could be back before midnight. That's if you still want to get out. I haven't much alternative, have I? It will be much worse for you if they do catch you. You know that. I'm wanted for murder. Or I will be, as soon as they find Matthews's body. They can't do much worse than that. You didn't kill him deliberately. Listen, Ann, I want you to get out of here. Just try and forget that you ever knew John Barlow. I want you to go and leave me to sort this thing out for myself. If I don't help you, what chance have you got? There is a chance. I can't tell you about it. But there is one chance. Now, I want you to go. Keep telling yourself that you never knew me. I'm just a paragraph in a newspaper. Promise me you'll do that. No. All right. I didn't want to have it this way, but why do you think I broke out of jail? To see you? If you think that, you're kidding yourself. I broke out because of the side of me you've always hated... because I'm a wanderer, because I could never settle down. So jail couldn't hold me. Now get out. Get out and leave me alone. [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING] - All set? - Yes. And Ferrari? He left on the 6 o'clock from Paddington. Good. You heard from Matthews yet? I saw him this afternoon. I think we'd better wait at the cottage. Jumpy, aren't you? A little. If you're nervous, Matthews ought to be petrified by now. Why? He organized the Karmania explosion. - Matthews did? - Quite a dark horse, isn't he? - It was murder. - Sure, it was. It was 23 murders. Still, he's getting well paid for them. Just for tipping someone off. He's a smart boy, Matthews. I wouldn't mind stepping into his shoes after they nab him. You think they will? It's just a question of time. They'll nab all of us. Still, if the money's as good as that, what a time you can have. No, no. They won't find me. - You hope. - Come on. Let's go. [FOOTSTEPS] [KNOCKING] All right? Yes. Gal gone? Yes, she's gone. Good. Ferrari should here in a minute. Well, have you painted any nice pictures lately? Huh? Oh, sure. I don't get much time with other activities. You don't get much time? I thought you got plenty. What other activities, Matthews? Need we go into that? Well, I'm sort of responsible around here. If you've any other activities besides ours, I should know about them. For instance, you never did tell me what you were doing in Falmouth this afternoon. I had some business with a friend of mine. I don't have to account for everything I do to you, do I? CANNING: Yes, pretty well. Cigarette? No. - I don't use 'em. - Oh, no. Of course. I forgot. Now, you'd, um, better take this. 400 quid. Useful, eh? Thanks. No use for me now. Hmm? Nothing. Now, the secret to this game, Matthews, is to know when to pull out. You take my advice and follow Uncle's example. Thanks. I'll do that. How about making some coffee? OK. Anyway, there are my instructions from MI5. - We'd better work fast. - All right, Osborne. I'll check into it once. Take a look at that report. Police headquarters here. Will you put me through to the Tolferro postmistress? Yes. It's very urgent, so please hurry. If what you say is right, we can thank Matthews for a lot. In five years, he's never been off the coast. Last November, he was operating in Comote. In July, he was in Dunlas. Always choosing some remote part of the coast, ostensibly to paint pictures. Hello, is that the Tolferro postmistress? This is police headquarters Lou here. Yes, I know it's very late. But this is a matter of national importance. Now, I want you to refer to all telegrams sent to Durrant Cottage. Yes. Now read them to me over the phone, will you? That as a pretty neat job you did last night. Huh? The Karmania. You've got a nice system, Matthews. I'd like to know who you tipped off in Amsterdam. Sugar? Thanks. How'd they manage to lay the mine? That's not our business. Yes. They picked an odd time to do it. Why? On account of Ferrari. Ferrari? Oh, yes. He's, um... Atom scientist, number three. If they keep this up, there won't be any left in the country. Good luck to him. What's eating you? Pretty big stuff, isn't it? No bigger than unusual you've been doing for the last three years. [KNOCKING] That'll be him now. Not bad. Gentlemen. There's something you have to tell us, isn't there? Yes. It's the name of the plant. Which is? Deadly Nightshade. And I have? A 10-pound note. All right, Professor. Your boat'll be sailing at 0430 hours tomorrow morning. Heinz will drive you in a motorboat till you get clear of the three-mile limit. The ship will pick up about four miles out. FERRARI: What time do we start? CANNING: Right away. Heinz will take us from Mary's Cove. It's about half an hour's walk from him. Oh, you probably won't eat till you get on board. Matthews, can you fix him up with something? I'll see. Thank you. You know, I often wonder what makes you birds do these sort of things... political or financial? Ideological. The world is divided into two parts, my friend. It should be united. With an atom bomb? The atom bomb is the scientist's natural weapon against the dark force of stupidity, against the destructive influence of the power politician and the little people of the world who make it possible for them to disunite mankind. And, uh, you, my friend? Me? For me, it all adds up to the same thing. I... I just like to get things in their right perspective. I go for the money from scratch. I'm not interested in the world. My views are purely neutral. Let the best man win. And when the bombs start falling, I aim to be somewhere else. Same with Heinz. Hey, Heinz? I just love all this paper stuff they call money. [FOOTSTEPS] [KNOCKING] See who it is, Heinz. What do you want? I want to speak to Mr. Matthews. He's not here. Don't move, anybody. What's the idea, Matthews? Are you out of your mind? Probably. Stay where you are. Would you care to explain what all this is about? Yes. I don't like playing with rough boys anymore. I've decided to settle down. Here's the blood money. The police had better find it on you. Police? Now look, Matthews, you're in this as much as anybody. You don't know how much. Go to the village. Use the back door. There's a shortcut across the farm. Get the police here as quick as possible. Whoever it is, stall them. One wrong word from you, and she'll get this. All right, Johnny. We're not kidding, Matthews. I'll take this. Keep an eye on the girl. [KNOCKING] Over here. [KNOCKING] You are Robert Matthews? - I thought we'd establish that. - Very well. I have a warrant for your arrest. BARLOW: On what charge? You are charged with jeopardizing the safety of the country by aiding and abetting agents of a foreign power. This isn't the first time you've got the wrong man, is it, Inspector? I must warn you that anything you say will be taken down and may be used in evidence. Funny how this smoking habit gets a hold of you, isn't it? I've been using them since I was 18. You ought to know me well enough by now, Inspector. The trouble is, you only think you know me. Don't try anything, Matthews. All right. We'll get along, Matthews. Look out! [GUNFIRE] All right. Take it easy. I'm all right. Get him over here. It grazed me a bit, honey. See if you can find some bandages, will you? We'll get this coat off. Ferrari. That the lot? - SERGEANT: I think so, sir. - All right. Take them out to the car. Wait for me there. Very good, sir. What happened to Matthews? The last I saw of him, he was taking a trip. INSPECTOR CLEMENTS: You didn't see him off by any chance, did you? I suppose someone would have done it eventually. Wouldn't we all know that? Thanks. Did you kill him? It was an accident. You seem to have a lot of bad luck with accidents, don't you? Perhaps you'll explain how you became involved in this. John was trying to hand these men over to the police. Yeah. Then they made a hostage of Ann and, well, complicated things. When did you realize this cottage was being used as a clearing house for foreign agents? Was it while you were talking to Matthews? Before you had the accident? Maybe. We believe he was getting ready to clear out. I must say, if I'd been in Matthews's shoes, I would have seen you as a heaven-sent decoy. He tried to get you to change places with him, didn't he? Then you realized who he was, and he tried to kill you. That's the best I can do. Thanks. You did a good job tonight, Barlow. I'll see that your help to the police is taken into consideration. Thank you, Inspector. I'll see you outside. What made you come back? I got the money for you. It's a little too late. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'll always wait for you. [MUSIC PLAYING]
