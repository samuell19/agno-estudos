(classical jovial music) (classical jovial music continues) (cat growls) (growling continues) (window sliding) - Get out of here you minchy squirrel. (dog barks) (classical jovial music) You down there? You go away or I'll call the police! - The name, Molly and you shouldn't throw shoes at people. - Is that so? What are you doing down there? Robbing us blind I'll beat you. I catch around here again, I'll beat you. (classical music) (metals jiggling) - Oh! (girl laughing) (classical music continues) (bird crows) - Lindsay. - Mother! Pretty Walton is coming to our Christmas party. I can't believe it. - Should I seat him next to Neville? - Don't put him anywhere near Neville. - And I could put him next to Greta Sweeney. - I really get mother. Do you think Greta will take a picture for the society page? - Maybe. - Ms. Lindsay says nothing madam. - Oh yes thank you Bridges. Bridges, did you bring up the flowers about three? - Loving an act of God. It should be here this afternoon, madam. (door opens) (footsteps approaching) (door slams) - Thank you, Bridges. Patrick, put the presents in the study. (footsteps fading) Good morning dear? - Where were you up to so early this morning? - Can't a man have his secrets at Christmas? - Dad, did you hear? Peltry Walton is coming to the party. Isn't that just grant? - Oh well now, we're not having a hoard of fraternity boys, are we Frances? - One is hardly a hoard dear. - Good, Walter Church Field and I have business to talk. And I don't want a lot of that bull up, bull up nonsense going on here. - (laughs) Daddy, you're so stuffy. - Haywood honestly, can't you put aside business for Christmas at least? - Not with a man like Church Field. Besides, it's a father's task to provide Frances. There's no time off for holidays. So, where's Neville? - Three seats to the window in a rowboat I bet. - You mean he's been out all night again? - I'm afraid so dear. - Well it's time I had a talk with that boy. - Daddy, can I have the car this afternoon for some shopping? - Shopping? Well Patrick can drive you, after he takes me to the club. - Oh, I knew you'd say yes. (smacks) - It's a blunder Haywood. - That's what daughters are for. - And sons? - Oh, now don't start Frances. - Haywood, it's Christmas. Can't you please- - Neville was encourage able. I said I'd talk to the boy, but I don't know what good it'll do. - I'm not talking about Neville. - Joe is not setting foot in this house! (bell rings) (vehicles honking) (wood bangs) (street people chattering indistinctly) (classical music) (wheelbarrow rolling) - It's all right David. (classical music) (kids chattering indistinct) - It's in the barrel. - Take it Joe. - What's going on? - The landlords tossed us out on Christmas eve. That's what. - He can't do that. - Yeah, I thought we had 60 days? - Not anymore. Talk to the police chief. He's got his hand in this for sure. (engine roaring) - Can I send her back in case there is any problem. - There's not going to be any trouble. - For what about Joe Dutton over The Dispatch? Who put this on the front page for sure? - Then leave that boy scouting this penny weekly to me. - Bt Joe and his father had been hating each other for years? The Dutton's can't buy chitlins wholesale without The Dispatch on its back. - Listen Donnely. Nobody's gonna hear about anything, until I am good and ready to break the news. Haywood Dutton included. - You mean he doesn't know we're throwing these people out? - That's right. Haywood Dutton knows nothing. Only knows is that I'm the cop that fixes his kids parking tickets. comes to me for nickel and diamond fillings and, when I come through, he cusses me a box of candy for the misses. Well this time, good old Murphy's bucking for a little bit more than a pound of chocolate candies. - You're kicking people out on a short notice is risky business. Why don't we just wait until their 60 days are up? - Because Donnely, you don't win big by playing it safe. Haywood Dutton's has got a buyer. Mr. Walter Church Field. There is a man of real power and influence in this community. And Walter has got a deal going, but he's got a problem. He's got a roll this over before the end of the year to avoid the tax man. So Walter wants Fennel Street front door, and he doesn't want Haywood Dutton to get buyers. - So Walter Church Field is the one who wants everybody out? Well, what about Joe Dutton and The Dispatch? If he's against his father leaving people homeless, he won't sit still for anybody getting away with it. - Relax Donnelley. Joe Dutton feud is just a smoke screen we need to get away with this. The more Joe thinks his father's a villain. The less time he's got to go swooping around. - I hope you're right. - I know I'm right. In the next 60 days Donnely, you could be working for Port city's New commissioner, after this. - Matching? - Donnely, get rid of her. - Follow along little girl. - Matches a 52 box lights anywhere. - Go home kid. - I don't have one. - Donnely. (door opens) (door bangs) (people chattering indistinctly) - We can't take this lying down David. Tell Joe we're counting on him. There's a meeting at the store in half an hour. - Cup pots boil inside. - You tell Joe Dutton, he can come to the meeting, or he can side with that rich father of his. It's up to him. - Calm down Kennely, I mean this isn't a county cork. (metal pounding) - [Woman] We can't tell where we're going. - [Officer] Don't worry he has grandma that refuge. (march stick ignites) (classical music) (camera snaps) - [Woman] You don't have official charge, no I can't even move. (women crying) - I won't let you down Mr. Church Field. There won't be a rental in Fennel Street come Monday. - And you'll take care of Haywood Dutton? - With pleasure sir. And, I'm Walter. And, I just had to accept you kind offer, to make a nice present for the the wife this Christmas. - Merry Christmas Murphy. (Murphy chuckles) (Murphy groans) (door slams) (engine roaring) (classical music) - I can count on that. (background noise drowns speech) I had a chocolate keep. I've doughnut - Chocolate please. - All right, that'll be 5 cents ah. - But I only have a penny. - No money no chocolate, uh? You want charity to go see a priest. (table bangs) (classical music) ♪ Matches ♪ ♪ Get your matches ♪ ♪ One cent, two, just a penny ♪ ♪ Matches ♪ - What are you doing here? This is my spot. ♪ Matches ♪ ♪ Get your matches ♪ (car honking) - Get out of the way. (car honking) - Mummy, get out of the way here. (people chattering indistinct) - [Man] He's not telling me.

(Molly chuckles) How's the coffee over there? - I ain't cheap. (Neville laughs) - Sounds like a girl a lot, nevermind. You won't care for a cup of cocoa. I hate to drink alone. - Sure, thanks. (door opens) (door slams) (hawkers chattering) - One coffee straight, and one cocoa. Alexander. - This is a push card buddy, it ain't the risk. - One black coffee, and one hot chocolate, with extra cream. - Now you're talking. - Thanks Neville Dutton. What's yours. - Molly. - What's up Molly? You live around here? - Nope. - I don't blame you. How old are you? - About eight? - (chuckles) I apologize. One never asks a lady her age. - All right, drink up and then get yourself another sucker. Street kids ah? Are always after something. - They've never gotten. - What's that? - Courage. - It doesn't come in a bottle. - All right, that's it smarty bidding. Go on you heard me, you're barred for business. - Hey Mr. Graham. It's a free country. - Oh it is, huh? Oh, you play boys think you know everything. Well, you can take your fancy car off my street. (table bangs) - We gotta get out of here. - Five round nuts! - That's an excellent idea. (playful music) (engine revving) (classical music) - Port City Dispatch! Famous to world paper. (printer running) - Morning David. - Morning Joe. - You've got a surprise in your office. - Something from Santa? (bell ringing) (door opens) (door slams) - Oh, some preserve tea? Merry Christmas, Joe. How's that feeling? - Improving, thank you. How's the eviction racket? - (laughs) I'm just a peace officer doing the job. - You're a regular credit to the force Murphy. - Joe, I came mainly to discuss the situation in Fennel Street. - Have you got the badge? Show it. - A little buddie tells me that, Frank co and the boys are getting there radically. If they do that I'll, have to throw them all in jail. - What if they have a permit? - That's highly unlikely, in light of recent dependence - In light of some of my father's cash. - Joe, hey. I'd come here, to ask you help me keep a lid on things. (lid bangs) The Dispatch is gospel on the South side. I mean everyone down here, thinks you print the truth. - That's because I do. - Fair enough, fair enough but, Joe, sometimes the truth hurts. Big headlines would only make things worse now. Be quiet about these evictions, and you will be doing everyone a favor. - You're asking me to sit on the hottest news story around here since prohibition. - That's right. That's the only way these people are going to be able to move out peacefully. While you are at it Joe. Cool down, frighten the boys, will you? I hate seeing people in jail at Christmas. - I didn't know you were so cheerful about holiday spirit chief? - (laughs) well, it's just say. I keep an eye out for the public good. - How good is homeless at Christmas? - You don't get righteous, Joe. Think about it. Just don't think too long. (feet stamping) I was talking to Mr. Finley at the bank. He tells me you're having trouble making ends meet throughout here. Terribly conservative people bankers. When those smell of jail and they whipped those loans back, (laughs) I hate to see The Dispatch close down, especially with your lovely wife being in the family way. (door opens) - You're gonna leave Mary Margaret out of this. - Why don't you wise up and run with the winners? - Why don't you crawl back in my father's pocket where you belong? - 'Cause I'm too big. - Fine tickets to the policeman's ball? - That Keystone's just threatened to see me in jail if I don't keep quiet about Fennel Street. - Well that's one way to win and pull a surprise. - What do you got for me? (footsteps stamping) - 24 hours to move. Final agree we may call it in better. - No, I don't get it. My father may love the almighty dollar but it's not his style to evict people illegally on Christmas Eve. - It's his company Joe, who else could be calling the shots? - We need an angle. - Rich people picking on poor people. - No, no, no, no. It's Christmas. People are out buying fudge and ice skating. They're not gonna sit still for a lecture. No, we need a grab her. an image here, or something that gets their attention and then tells the story. - How about a face that says it all? - You've been talking to Willy Hearst? - He should be this lucky. Take a look at that. - Who in heaven's name is she? - A mash girl David found on the street, nameless and homeless. What a face, ah? - Rita, this is it. (smacks) By tonight everybody in Port City is gonna be crying their eyes out over this little girl. - And buying The Dispatch. - You better believe it. I want everybody to look at this picture. I want you to look at this little girl, she ain't probably hasn't had a decent meal in weeks, but when I am through, everybody in this town is gonna know this little girl. You cannot throw people out at Christmas in town. (men shouting) (men clapping) I don't care who you're. (men shouting) (men clapping) (classical buoyant music) (engine roaring) (engine stops) - What do you think sweetheart? - Like a house in a story book. - (laughs) And where do you need papa bear, mama bear and baby bear? Ah, we go. - What a house? (door slams) ♪ I'm forever blowing bubbles out the blue ♪ (feet stamping) - Good morning Master Neville? Shall I tell Edith to fix you the old rule? - Definitely. Molly, this is Bridges. A man who tolerates all of us. - Nice to meet you. - The pleasure miss, is mine. (footsteps approaching) - Well, look what the cat dragged in? - Baby bear. Morning Lindsey, you're an early bird catching any worms? - Who is that? - Her name is Molly. Where are the loved ones? - In the library. (footsteps fading) (clock tickling) - Bonjouor my family? Molly, meet the mighty Duttons of Port City. - How do you do? - Hello Molly? - An explanation is in order Neville. - Well, father I cannot tell a lie. (chuckles) I single-handedly saved this little orphan girl from a rabbit donut vendor. Goodnight sweetheart. - Yes sir. - Well now that you've rescued her, what do you plan to do? - Keep her. - Out of the question. - But father, after all I found her. - Take her downstairs, give her a cup of milk and let her run along. - Obviously you too. She's a little girl, not an alley cat. Come here child. Do you have a home Molly? Would you like to stay with us for a while? - Sure. - Mother! - Frances, are you mad? - It's the charitable thing to do, Haywood. - Dutton house is not a foundling home. There are orphanages for this sort of thing. How do you know she isn't a runaway? - Well we don't, and there's no way of finding out until after the holidays, is there? Besides every child deserves a Merry Christmas. Isn't that right, Molly? - Yes. Ma'am. (clock tickling) - All right, all right. Child can stay for a few days. But only until the proper authorities are notified. - She's not coming to the party, is she? - Oh, don't worry Lindsay. She won't steal your dance card. - You rang sir, Bridges would you take- what's her name? - Molly. - Molly. (chuckles) - Molly, down to Edith. See that she's cared for, and strictly supervised I don't want her tramping about the house getting into things. - Yes sir. - Well, that's settled. If the office calls I'll be in the billiard room. (footsteps fading) - Bridges. - Yes madam. - Ask Edith to look in the charity box for some clothes. I think Molly might fit into one of Lindsey's old middies. - Certainly madam. Come along Molly. - Thank you Mrs. Dutton, you're very nice lady. (Frances chuckles) - She's a smooth little operator. - You're jealous? - Oh you two please act your age. - Well Lindsay tries mother, but it's difficult to talk and suck your thumb at the same time. (feet stamping) - He didn't bet than higher the price. He just pointed at the bird and said, "Wrap it up." - Mr. Dutton loves the message, and doesn't think anything about turning people out of their homes. - How should we know Venula. - I know you have people in the Fennel Street, but if it wasn't for Mr. Dutton, you'd have been off the boat without a penny to your name. - Don't fight the hand that feeds you now. - And would you rather have us coward like with puppies Patrick and not stand up for what's right? - You're paid to work Venula save your politics to Sunday in the park. - Cool. Who do we have here Mr. Bridges? - Her name's Molly. You'll take her and keep her busy tide her up. She'll be staying for a few days. Is Mr. Neville's tray ready? - I added it a little pair of the dog. - You would throw in the tail, I'd hoped you could help. - Well, let's have a look at you. When was the last time you had a bath dearly? - It's been a long time. - Peg, Venula, give her a good scrubbing, and when you're finished, I'll fix her nice hair. (feet stamping) - This what we need, the busiest day of the year and we're stuck babysitting raggedy in. - Oh to be sure you have your hands full with Peg and Venula. - What do you mean by that? - Oh, don't play coy with me Patrick. I see you floating away with the two of them. Now one of these days, you're going to have to make a choice, and that may be sooner than you think. - Jamie, I have a Santa Claus for you. - Stop, that's all. Merry Christmas. (door slams) (Joe laughing) What are you doing up there? The doctor told you to take it easy. - I'm not a China doll Joe. - Oh yes you are. (both laughing) (pizza thuds) - You're frisky today. Something tells me you're onto a star. (both chuckling) - What do you mean? - Whenever you're full of yourself you get lovey-Venula and I get to notice. - You'll never marry an Irish girl Jamie. (Margaret chuckles) What? What is it? - Oh, the baby's got hick up sweetheart. - Hick up? - Now tell me What's up? - Oh, David shot a great picture this morning. A little match girl that he found in Fennel Street, right in the middle of everything. But nobody knows and what is worse, nobody cares. But by tonight, I'm gonna have everybody in Port City trying to get a roof over her. Looks great. - Yeah. - I have a meeting that I have to get to down at the callers grocery. - Joe! - Mary Margaret, it's important. - And keeping your promise to your family, isn't? It's Christmas Eve, Joe. - Look, I am sorry but I wasn't counting on my father, pulling the rug out from under these people. - If you really want to help, why didn't you sit down with the man face to face instead of taking pot shots at him in the paper? - He hasn't said a word to me in five years, Mary Margaret. What makes you think he's going to listen to me now? - You're awfully hard on your father, Joe. - Well he's harder on me. - I don't want to argue. Go if you have to, just try and be back in time for supper. - And you take care of your mom's port. (footsteps fade) (door slams) (paper shuffles) - Come on Jamie. Let's decorate the tree. - You sure do you have a lot of Christmas stuff? - That's because I've seen a lot of Christmases. (chuckles) We used to make such a fuss over the holidays, the children and I would spend months making ornaments. And then the minute December arrived, we'd start decorating the whole house, bed ribbons and pine boughs all up and down the banisters. Great big Holly ball out in the entryway. There wasn't a nook or cranny that didn't have a Santa clause or a candy cane in it. (Frances chuckles) - Wow. - And Haywood and the boys would spend hours tramping over the hills, looking for the perfect tree. - Doesn't anybody help you decorate anymore? - Oh goodness no. (chuckles) they're all too busy, doing what they do. No now I just call up the florist, and it's all done in about an hour, but I don't mind telling you. It's very nice having a little girl as a helper this year. - What's this? - This? This was Neville's first stocking. I made it myself. Believe it or not, Neville was a very sweet little boy. - This is the pretty one. - Now this was Lindsey's when she was eight years old, she was very particular about the color she wanted. Lindsey's always been very particular. - Joe? - Mm hmm. - Who's Joe? - Joe is my eldest son. - Is he going to be at the party? - Nope. Joe isn't allowed in the house. - Did you do something wrong? - That's hard to say really? You see Haywood, wouldn't allow Mary Margaret into the family. He said it was an inappropriate marriage for her Dutton. - Inappropriate? What does that mean? - That means, Protestant boys from Timber Hill don't marry, Catholic girls from the South side. - That's silly. - I tried to reason with the two of them but, they wouldn't even speak to each other. I think the trouble really began when Joe, turned his back on the business. You see, Haywood had such high hopes for him in the company. And, when Joe decided to go his own way, I think it hurt Haywood more than he ever let on. - Sounds like they're both pretty stubborn. - You're a smart little girl. (chuckles) I made this one four years ago. When I heard Mary Margaret and Joe were expecting. They had a baby boy, Jamie. After her father. It's silly but, I actually thought that baby might change things. (classical music) (hammer pounding) - Almost there Joe. (group chattering indistinct) (man hammering) (men chattering indistinct) (hammering continues) - Come on. (men chattering) (classical music) one, two, three, four. (Neville laughs) (Molly laughs) - Move out of the great path. (classical music continues) (music stops) - Molly, you may go. Greta Sweeney will be at the party tonight I hope. - Battled scandal queen. - Now listen to me. I am sick and tired of your escapades. I want you sober and civil tonight. Walter Church Field will be here. And while I'm with them- - Don't tell me you're gonna try and sell him that Fennel Street, dump over cookies and egg no? - This isn't a game Neville. The Church Field signs on the dotted line. It'll mean hundreds of thousands. - Don't we already have thousands of thousands? - I cannot afford any incidents. I want my family spotless, understand? - Don't worry father, I'll wash behind the ears. - Good, I'm glad we understand each other. (fire crackling) Tell your mother I'll be in the Billiedroom. (fire crackling) (classical playful music) (hammer pounding) (group chattering) (engine stops) (men chattering indistinctly) (hammers pounding) - Still Dutton up here. - I know. - He said he wasn't gonna make any trouble. - This is America Donnely. There is no law against stupidity. - Ah, Haywood Dutton's about to find out. - I know he will. 'cause I'm the one that's going to tell him. (dog barking) (golf balls bang) - All right, here we are. - Merry Christmas, Bridges. - Oh don't spoil the help Sam. On on all the rest of us. Thank you very much sir. - I'd like you, to help me battle up, Walter Church Field this evening. - You think he's really interested in Fennel Street? - It's good income property at a fair price. He'd be a fool to pass it by. - What about your tenants? - I gave them 60 days notice on the first. They can either move out, or take their chances with new landlord. The local police chief is keeping an eye on things for me so far so good. Murphy tells me that everything seems to be running smoothly. - It's not the way The Dispatch paints it. - The Dispatch paints everything yellow. You should know that by now Sam. A few renders have made appeals, there's nothing to worry about. The property is mine, I have a right to sell it. - There's a telephone call for you sir. - Excuse me Sam. - I'm sorry to disturb you Mr. Dutton but, you told me to let you know if there was any trouble down the Fennel Street. - What? (clock tickling) But I gave them fair notice. Well within our legal rights, don't they understand? - Well, the simple people say, "They believe what they read in the papers." If you catch my drift. Yeah, I'm afraid so sir. And Joe's been pretty hard laying lately and, now he's out on the street with them. Oh yes sir, yes sir. Yes I saw him with me own eyes. It will before I take any action, I thought I'd checked with you sir. Being as how he's your son and, and it's the holidays and everything eh, I might go easy on him. - Well, I appreciate your offer Murphy, but if he's determined to stir up trouble, then you have no choice, do your duty. You heard me. If my son has no respect for his family, then maybe spending a night in jail will teach him some respect for law and order. (telephone bangs) (crowd chattering quietly) (whistle blows) - Murphy! I'll like to know what is happening to all of us. (engine roaring) (crowd chattering) - Hello Harvey. - Hello Kennely. (engine roaring) - Joe, you're under arrest. - On what charge? - Trespassing. - Try another one chief. Nobody around here has filed any complaints. - Nobody around here owns the street. - [Man] Public's free. - My father is having me arrested? - He said a night in jail might do some good. And if you don't put that hammer down, I'll throw in assaulting an officer. - Those charges won't stick in you know and I got too many witnesses. - Call out this rally, shut your presses. There's no need for this to go any further. - Forget it. - Donnely! - Murphy, his wife's gonna have a baby any minute. Don't put him away now, she needs this. - We should have thought about that this morning. - Walk him down the rift. Trespassing, and assault. - Tell my father he's not gonna get away with this. - He already has. This rally is over. - [Woman] We'll all be witnesses. - I give you one hour to clear this street. Anyone left grumbling, eats the Christmas pie in jail! (curtain glides) - Molly, why don't you go and get the Christmas logs for the fire, and we'll take them up to the Mrs in a minute. - Mr. Bridges wasn't too happy when he found me upstairs? - Well, never you mind about Mr. Bridges. He's not the only one who gives the orders around here. Now run along child. (plates bang) (phone ringing) (door slams) Dutton house, This is Edith. Speak up, you sound like you're in a pickle barrel. (telephone bangs) Jesus, Mary and Joseph! Joe's in jail. Come along child. (footsteps approaching) - Oh, there you are Edith. Would you tell Bridges I think the milkman has overcharged us again. - Yes ma'am. Molly, put the logs in the fireplace. - What is it Edith? Nothing going wrong with the dinner I hope. - No ma'am, it's Joe. - Joe? - He's in jail ma'am! Something about Fennel Street. - And Mary Margaret? - The baby could come anytime. They're poor as mice and, her family has nothing. How will she ever get him out of jail. - There must be something I can do. - But you've tried before ma'am, and Joe's turned it all away. Don't you think what Mr. Dutton would do if he ever found out? I know Edith but I can't just sit idly by, and let them lock my son up like some drunken sailor. (match stick crackles) Edith, tell Patrick to bring the car around. - Oh, you're not going down to the station ma'am in broad daylight. Somebody might see you. - No one will see me, don't worry. Get your coat, we haven't much time. - But the dinner ma'am, there's a million things to do still, and Bridges would suspect something's up. If I left the pudding to Peg and Venula. - Molly, can you keep a secret? - Yes, ma'am. - Good because you're coming with me. (metal gate clanks) - The camera I left you with it, and make it snappy. (feet stamping) - Not really going. - All right. - We got to get all here- (gate shuts) (chain clanks) - Hey keep it down now. - All right, come on. (inches squeaking) - How's Mary Margaret. - I don't know I ran down here as soon as I heard. Tell her I'm fine David, don't let her get upset about this. And make sure she's not alone tonight. - Don't worry I'll check on her when I get back. - I should break out here or I'm gonna get locked up. - Hey, you're not gonna miss the baby. We'll get you out of here. We already started raising your bail. I had no idea you were such an expensive guy. - If anything happens to Mary Margaret while I'm in here, I swear my father's gonna pay. - I want that little girl's picture on the front page tonight you understand? I want a big story on Fennel Street and I want everybody in town to know that Haywood Dutton threw his own son in jail. You got that? - You got it Joe, relax. I'll take care of everything. You just enjoy the fine dining in here. (gate squeaking) - David! Tell Mary Margaret I love her. (footsteps fading) (metal clanks) (piano music) - Neville, have you seen my blue handbag? What are you doing? - Smell that Lindsey, that's Christmas. - Go upstairs and get dressed for God's sake. Where's mother? It's late, she promised to do my hair for the party. - Is this what you're after? - Give me that. - It clashes. One compact one change parse, an old ballet ticket, one lipstick pedal pink, something that looks like a stale lozenge, and a white lace hanky. - Where are my lemon drops? You're impossible. - Somebody has to be. - This where Joe lives. (engine roaring) (feet stamping) - Eat this Jamie then we'll go visit heifer downstairs at the newspaper. (Frances knocking) Coming. (classical music) - Hello Mary Margaret? May we come in? - Please. - This is Molly. - Nice to meet you. - Hello Molly. (door slams) - This Jamie. - He's almost three. - Hi. - I had no idea he looks so much like Joe. - That's what everyone says. Jamie, say hello to your grandma Frances. - Oh Jamie. If your grandpa Haywood could see you this whole nasty mess would be over in an instant. - Would you like some tea? - No, there isn't time. Mary Margaret, Joe has been arrested. - What? - Yes, I brought the money for his bail. The car's waiting outside to take us to the station. - I appreciate what you're doing Mrs. Dutton, but I can't take the money. Joe would never forgive me. - Dear, don't you think Joe would rather be home tonight with you and the baby? - Yes but- - Mary Margaret, there comes a time when a wife has to, turn a blind eye to her husband's pride, and do what's best for her family. If I thought for one instant about Haywood at a time like this I wouldn't be here. - You're right, thank you. - Oh, are we taking Jamie with us? - Good heavens Jamie. I almost forgot, it's time for him to eat. - Molly, do you think you could take care of Jamie? We'll just be gone short while? - I'm a good babysitter. I can take care of him until you get back. - Thank you Molly. It isn't very far, we won't be gone long. His applesauce is right here. His toys are in the living room in the cupboard. If you need anything, you just go down to the newspaper and ask for Rita. Understand? - Yes. - Be a good boy, mommy won't be long - Mama! Mama! (Molly chuckles) - Got new crayons? - Hmm. - Bridges, do you think we should contact the authorities? - Yeah, I'm sure I Mrs. Dutton is just delayed down town with some last minute shopping sir. - Don't worry daddy, I'll be your hostess. (smacks) - Did you lay out my clothes, Bridges? - Yeah, everything is ready for you sir. - Oh not there Peg, on the table. I want to take the mints downstairs. - Peg, where are you going with the mints? - Ms. Lindsay wants them removed sir. - But we always have mints at Christmas? - Well, this year we're having fun bonds Neville. By the way guests will be here in less than two hours. Think about dressing, would you? - Looks like the dinghy's taken over the harbor Bridges? - What's this? - Santa! - Right. What's this? - star. - Good. And who's riding the star? Gotcha, that is the angel. That's how they get around. If somebody in trouble, anywhere in the whole world, they just have water shooting star, slide right down from heaven (air whooshing) like that. - Angel. - Good, you're a pretty smart kid Jamie. Just the rest of your family worried about. Did you like meeting tour grandma Frances? She's a nice lady. It's too bad your daddy and grandpa are mad at each other. I think it really makes her sad. I wish there was a way we could fix things. - Grandpa. - What about, that head, we'll do what your grandma's said. We'll take you to see your grandpa. (footsteps fading) (engine roaring) Can't juts cannot be kiddo. I know. (paper shuffling) (classical music) (paper shuffling) (footsteps fading) Grandpa. (door slams) - How's Joe? - Behind bars. Tristan where did you let that little girl's play yet? - You bet. - Good. Joe wants your face front and center. Anything you've on her. - Nothing, she came out of nowhere and she went right back again. That kid is real mystery. - Oh Mary Margaret I almost forgot. How's the kitty? - $2 and 20 cents at this rate we won't get Joe out of jail till Easter. You know I tried it there earlier. - No answer. - Great. (papers shuffling) I better go check on her. - Tell her Joe's in jail and he loves her, okay? - How stupid you are. (papers shuffling) (classical music) - We can't go running off all handcuffs. - Murphy's not playing Fennel, should we? - Come on Jamie, enter the rock. (Jamie groans) - That's right, he's after something not good and he threw Joe the slammer to keep him quiet. - I see. We march down to that cave, and blast the boy out. - Listen to Al Capon here. - You got any better ideas? - Yeah, you do sacrifice some bill mike. I look forward to reading it on The Dispatch. Someone may have squandered his style size. (box crackling) He chased us up Timber Hill (door locks) (classical music) (engine starting) - Your mother? - Yes. - I told you you're too late Frank. - You gotta put it in tonight's paper David. - Candlelight parades to Dutton house, what's this? - We're taking the rally straight to Haywood Dutton front door. - Sorry Frank, it's inciting to riot we could be shut down. - Come on Rita, it's two birds with one stone. We can't just let them cuss us outside our homes like garbage. And what better place the past I have for Joe? - Are you nuts? It's Christmas eve Frank. The Dutton's are having their big bash. Anybody who's anybody is up there tonight. Do you really think that you're gonna march on Timber Hill with a bunch of South Siders and get away with it? Besides we're already printing. (printer running) - Oh perfectly done, Joe used to prefer David to do it for him. - I'm doing the best I can, damn it! - Listen Rita, nobody knows where Mary Margaret is. She could be off trying to raise money for Joe by herself. I don't know. Our kitty is up to a whopping $3. So that's not enough to spring a puppy from a pile. But Frank's got a point. If we don't think of something fast. Joe could be locked up for a long time. (machine printing) - Okay, Okay, scratch everything. We've got a new front page. That little girl's picture, Joe behind bars and Frank's parade. And if we are shut down cop, I am personally moving this entire paper to the grocery store. - You got a deal. - Oh, and David, tell Pricey to print flyers too, I want every news boy on every corner to get 100 each. Everybody hears about this parade whether they fine it's back to nuts. Are you happy? - Very. (printer running) (Molly shouts) - Tell me Edith, do you know where Mrs. Dutton is? - I'm sure I couldn't say. - Edith tell me Mr. Dutton has a right to know. - Out of my way Windsel Bridges if you know what's good for you. (bowl clanks) (water bubbling) Tried with a mess with Patrick gone. - Where can they be? Has nobody called the police to the hospital? - They have a trace of concern for young Patrick and you and your boys? - I don't give a fig whether he lives or dies and you can tell him I said so. - You've got more pride than sense Joe Dutton. - I won't do it Mary Margaret. I won't use my father's money to get me out of jail. - If you thought about us as much as you think about your father you wouldn't be in this mess. I'm sorry Joe, I just can't understand. I believe in you, but I just don't see why you want to play the market behind bars. When you've got a chance to get out and do some good. - Are you all right? - No, I'm not. The baby's been kicking. I'm tired to the bond. Jamie's at home waiting for me and you're driving me crazy. - Yes ma'am. I consent to that. - Hey, it'll be all right. Just get me out of here. I can't leave my China doll all alone on Christmas Eve okay? (feet stamping) - Neville, why do you always have to be so inappropriate. - Well, that's my specialty. (bell rings) - Don't answer Bridges, we can't let anyone in until mother gets back. - Well, we can't leave the mystery guests freezing outside. - Bridges! How do we explain mother? - We say she eloped with Sand Nick. - Somebody answer the door. - Daddy, what are we gonna say about mother? - Thank you Bridges. - Ah Gregor! - Oh Lindsay don't you look smashing? Ah and Neville, you steal my heart. - We should be so lucky. - Merry Christmas Greta. - Haywood Darling, I hope you don't mind my coming a little early to the party, but I told Frances, I'd like to capture the ambience of a party, before the revelers arrive. - Will, (footsteps faint) - Get the parlor, get the tree, get the table. You'll get the family on the staircase later. - Yes ma'am. - And, where is our Frances? Still primping upstairs? - Her sister, Romaine, took a turn for the worst I'm afraid. She had to dash up to, New Haven this afternoon. This is the first time Frances will have missed the Christmas party. But it's family you understand? - Of course, how tragic for you? - Yes. Shall we have some punch? - Romaine! - Now what are we going to do if mother comes back? - Never heard of her sister, Romaine. - Courage says, "High society is in jungle." (feet stamping) - That's correct? - Joe's wife still at the back? - Yes sir. - Did she bring cash? - More than enough. (paper shuffling) - There's a senior prisons officer. (piano music) (door bangs) - Joe! - Mum! - Joe, are you all right? They didn't hurt you, did they? - I'm fine mother. - All well, but you're so wound. (soft piano music) - It's good to see you mum. - Let's get Mary Margaret to calm, she shouldn't be out here, it's cold. (door opens) I just wanna know who had the nerve to lock up my son. - The police, who else? They've got the keys. - Merry Christmas Mr. Joe. - Merry Christmas, Mr. Patrick. - Well, I'd better hurry now. I'm late as it is. Half the town must be at the party by now. - Mum, thank you. - Joe, you know we all miss you terribly. - Well, say hello to Neville and Lindsay. - We're having an open house all day tomorrow. They want to stop by. - Well I think they like that pretty much. (engine roaring) Well you better run now, get at home now to that beautiful baby boy. I'll send Molly back the taxi. (soothing piano music) - Mum, tell Lindsay that I feel grim about the fam party. (door slams) (engine starts) (engine revving) (piano music) (door slams) - Haywood Dutton please. - Church Field, so glad you could come. - Where's your man out there Dutton? We have to park on the street? - Bridges, where on earth is Patrick? Find him and see him to the parking at once. - Immediately sir. I'm afraid there's an urgent telephone call, regarding Mrs. Dutton's sister. Romaine sir. - I see, excuse me Church Field, I'll only be a moment. - This way madam, this way sir. - Yes. Yes Murphy. What? (bells ringing) (telephone bangs) (chiming music) - Don't worry Jamie, I don't know where we're going. You gotta see your grandfather no matter what. (piano music) - The dinner bell is going to ring in a minute and the bird hasn't even set yet. I'll pray to God they don't notice. Patrick Mrs. Dutton comes in. - How's Joe? - Mrs. you're cooking, has dinner started yet? - No ma'am but it's almost time. Mr. Dutton is side himself. Patrick where on earth have you been? - I'll tell you later. (smacks) under the mistletoe! (lady laughs) (classical music) - Frances! - Oh, Haywood. Hello dear, I'm so sorry, but I'm going to go change and be done in just a moment. - Just like that? No explanation? Not only have you embarrassed me, by not being here, to receive our guests, but you ran to the police station like a skid row bail bondsman. - Who told you I was at the police station? - That's beside the point. - I want to know. - The police chief called me himself, are you satisfied? Now every cop on the beat knows that my wife, got Joe out of jail. - You had Joe arrested. - Frances. - You had our son thrown into jail. - It was his own doing. Look, we'll discuss this later. Go change your clothes. I'll tell everyone that your sister Romaine, has had a remarkable recovery. Dinner will be in a minute. - If you think I'm going to sit by your side and sip constantly like a dutiful wife after what you've done to Joe. You are sadly mistaken. - Frances! - I have nothing more to say to you. (door slams) - Frances. Open the door. (door bangs) Frances! - Haywood, darling. Is that you? - Hello Greta. - I thought I heard shouting. - Well. (dinner bell rings) Shall we go down the dinner? (Greta chuckles) (group chattering quietly) (door slams) - Molly! Jamie! - We're home. - Jamie! Jamie! Molly! Jamie! Jamie! - Not in the garage I explored. - Joe! Where are they? - I know what happened, don't worry. Rita probably just took them downstairs, to the office. - Wait, - What is it? (paper shuffling) - They could freeze out in weather like this. - I'm going after them, maybe I can catch them before they get to Dutton house. Or if I have to, I will walk right into the party and ask my father politely if he's seen my son. - I love you, let's go. - Whoa! Where are you going? - With you, please Joe. (paper shuffles) - Okay, let's go. (soft piano music) (ladies chattering quietly) - Dinner is served sir. - Oh, I was kindly starving. (feet stamping) (couples chattering) - Thank you. - Gretas! Oh my God I didn't even introduce you. - Oh my God! - Greta, this is Pretty Walton, Greta Sweeney. (guys chattering) - Your wife, such a swell table Dutton. - Frances will be very glad you approve, please. Thank you Bridges. (spoons jiggling) - Neville, you remember Freddie Walton? - I don't remember. - Another triumph for your dear mother. I've always said she's the best hostess in town. It's such a shame that Frances can't be here. - Oh, she's here Greta, in spirit, pass the nut bread, will you? (Molly inhales sharply) - Come on Jamie, I'll help you out. (footsteps pattering) I know it's cold out here. I have something to make you feel better. (match stick ignites) There's a big fire, in a marble fire place. It will warm you right up. Don't get too close now. - I'd ask for a place around your fire but, three on a match, bad luck. (laughs) (air whooshes) - We're lost. - Join the club. I missed my bus. Where are you two supposed to be? - Timber Hill. - Oh you really are lost. (laughs) This is Denver Hill honey. - We're looking for the Dutton house. Do you know where that is? - Sure, I do. I'll take you there, it's right on my way. It's about 20 minute walk. (piano music) - Thanks Santa. - We'll have to go real slow though, this boots are killing me. (Christmas music) (footsteps approaching) - Merry Christmas Santa. - And merry Christmas to you, honey. - Bye bye. - Bye bye. - Bye. - bye. (footsteps approaching) (group chattering indistinct) (footsteps approaching) (door opens) (door closes) (footsteps approaching) (feet stamping) (couples chattering) (man laughs) - Where are they? - Here they are. - what's going on? (crowd chattering quietly) - No, thanks. (crowd chattering quietly) - Bridges, What's that noise? Perhaps this Joseph's role was not to ignore. (engine roaring) - [Crowd] No, no. (engine roaring) - Welcome back Joe, Joe! Come on Joe. - Are you all right? - I think so. - You could make it. - What's everybody doing her? - They came all the way here to get their homes back Joe and to get you out of jail. - [Crowd] That's right Joe. - Come on say it man. (shouting drowns speech) - I'm sorry, but I came here to pick up my son and that is it. (crowd groans) - Oh, come on. - Sure, he's safe and sound now, he doesn't give a damn about anybody else. - True. - No, forget it. How did you get out. - My mother bailed me out. And it took a lot of nerve for her to do it. She's having her Christmas party in there, David but I don't wanna ruin it by using her, her front porch as a soap box. - Hey, listen Joe, you aren't the only reason these people came up here. Tomorrow, half of them gonna lose the roof over their heads. Just get up there, make a quick speech and send him home with a little hope. - Do you think it'll work? - Murphy didn't have you arrested for nothing? These people would follow you off a cliff. You tell them what to do, they'll do it. - All right. - All right. - I wanna thank you all for coming out here tonight. You came because a neighbor was in trouble, but it's you the people of Fennel Street that are in real need. Let's get you back your home. (crowd shouting) (man coughs) (diners chattering) (spoons jiggling) - What's going on out there Dutton? - I don't know, but I'm gonna put a stop to it. Please, don't allow the noise to spoil your meal. It seems there are some people outside, who have their holidays confused. They think this is Halloween instead of Christmas. (diners laughing) (crowd shouting) - I promise you this- The fight is not over yet. (crowd shouting) It's gonna take time and it's gonna take money. So we're gonna pass the hat, dig deep in your pockets and be generous. It means shelter and food for everybody. (crowd cheering) (crowd chanting) - Who is out there making all that noise? - Joe? - Joe? - Joe Dutton? - [Crowd] Save our home, save our home. - That's J-O-E Greta. It's been five years since he set foot in this house. If I were you, I'd clear out quick before the walls come tumbling down. - [Crowd] Save our home, save our home. (footsteps approaching) - It looks like they mean business sir. - As well see if the guests I'm gonna call the police. - I don't care if you have to crawl out the Marines, Murphy. I want those people out of my front yard immediately. Well, see that you do it. - Hello Mr. Dutton? - How did you get in here? - Jamie, say hello to your grandpa. - Papa. - Jamie? - Joe's boy, doesn't he look just like him? (classical piano music) - Who told you to bring him in here? - Nobody. - Don't lie to me little girl. My son put you up to this, didn't he? The same man who has turned those people out there against me. - Joe didn't do anything. Those people outside are mad because you're making the move on Christmas Eve. - I'm doing no such thing. - You are doing, Murphy said so. - That's ridiculous. - He told everybody on Fennel Street, the landlord wanted them out in 24 hours. - Do I look like the kind of man that would evict people at Christmas? (crowd shouting) Told Murphy to keep an eye on things. That's all, I wanted everything done legally and properly. - Well he did everything wrong. And now all those people outside think you're a bad man. And he threw Joe in jail too, just to keep me quiet about it. - Are you telling me that the police chief of the South side is a crook? - Yes sir. He has been fooling you. If you don't believe me, talk to Joe. - I'll do no such thing. Now stop pestering me for God's sakes. Out, the both of you come on. Let's go out. - Let's go. - No, no, no. Don't touch that. That's not for you. That's a present for my wife. (piano music) Your grandmother. All well, okay. Now run along, well Santa will be good to you. Here, there. - Mrs. Dutton doesn't wanna fuck off for Christmas. She just wants you and Joe to get back together again. - Who told you that? - She did. Come on Jaime. (crowd shouting) - Why don't you go back into the dining room Master Neville? - Nonsense Bridges. This is the best seat in the house. - Molly, What on earth are you doing up here? - Sweetheart, where have you been? You're just been time for dessert. - Who's this fellows short stuff? - Bridges, take these children back to their friends in the street. - You can't turn them over to that mob. They'll be trampled on like little ducks. - Don't interfere, Neville. - Don't worry, me and Jamie will be all right. - My God! Is this Jamie? Is this Joe's Jamie? Bridges look, it's Joe's boy. - Daddy what's keeping you. We're waiting to start the pudding. - Look, siz. It's Joe's baby boy. - Bridges, will you get those children out of here? - Yes sir. - Come Lindsay, we have dinner guests. - Can't stand the site of him, can you? He looks too much like Joe. - You're drunk, Neville. - Not this time. You know what father? Sometimes, you're remarkably unperceptive about me. Oh, don't get me wrong. I don't blame you. I'm a wash out of a son compared to Joe. Always have been, it's God's cruel joke, fathers and sons, huh? They're either so much alike, they lock horns from day one, or they're so completely different. They just never hit it off. And the capper is, old Haywood Dutton got himself one of each. (laughs) (slap thuds) - Daddy! - Neville, don't be a fool. (door slams) (door opens) - [Woman] We have Dutton's over there. - There's one of them. - [Crowd] Yeah. (crowd conversing indistinctly) (soothing piano music) (crowd clapping) - Come on tag. - Too long for you brother. - Mommy. - Jamie? - Mary Margaret. - Stop her. - Slow down. - Jamie! Jamie! - How comes we were where I can't see a fake. (crowd chattering quietly) - Where's Freddie? - Good night. - Sorry Lindsey, gotta run. - Well, we haven't even had dessert yet? (diners chattering indistinctly) (feet stamping) - Can I go now, please? - Bridges told me to keep an eye on you. And that's just what I'm doing. Now, drink your cocoa dearly, and be thankful you're in one piece. This is a night that's going to go down in the history books. - Stop these silly new luck stealing someone- - I don't want to be safe Peg. My cousins are out there fighting for their very lives. I can't sit cozy in here. - Venula, can I come with you please? - The mob out there is no place for a little girl, Molly. - But I have to talk to Joe, it's important. - All right, but you stay close to me. Do you hear? - Just where do you think you're going Venula? - Outside where I belong. where we all belong? You come along or you step aside, Patrick? It's up to you. (feet stamping) - Okay, Patrick you're not going. It could mean your job? - I'm sorry Peg. (footsteps fading) (door slams) - Cheer up Peg, there'll be others. - Thank you Hellen. - Charlie, what do you got? - There's the bone that sells Fennel Street. Get him. (crowd shouting) Get him. - Oh! - Mary Margaret! (crowd shouting) - Wait, wait, listen to me. This isn't the way. - Bridges, under no circumstances is anyone to open the front door, do you understand? - Of course I do. - The baby. Somebody tell Joe she's having the baby. - Please stop violence, it will take us nowhere. We have to stay calm. - Joe! It's Mary Margaret, she's having the baby. - Oh my God. - We'll never get her to the hospital in this crowd. Dr. Easton's at the party, Joe. (crowd chattering) - Come on. - We need to know! - [Crowd] You'll be all right. (Mary breathing heavily) (footsteps stamping) - Let's lay here here down as we try. Just fine, don't. (Mary groans) whoa! Whoa! Easy but carefully everybody. (Mary groaning) stay there, calm down. (Mary groans) (Joe knocking) Open the door we need a doctor! (knocking continues) (Mary groans) - Haywood darling, it's just too exciting. There's a woman outside in labor. - Greta, shut up! (knocking continues) - [Man] Open the door. (footsteps approaching) - Who's that on the porch? - I'll see. (footsteps fade) It's Mary Margaret. - Just get closer, maybe we could help. - You be careful up there darling. - Okay. - Don't you worry, I'll get you a doctor if I have to break the door down. - (gasps) She took a fall Joe, I'm worried. (Joe knocking) - Open the door damn it. (Mary gasping) (door banging) If you won't let us in, send Dr. Austen out for God's sake. (door banging) - Don't worry, you'll be all right Mary Margaret. (Mary gasping) - You just get some hot water and thin linen. We could put her in the den. - That won't be necessary Edith. - Haywood it's our duty. - [Joe] Open the door. - It's your duty Sam. If you wanna help that woman, take some blankets and go outside. - But daddy we could put her downstairs at least? - Be quiet Lindsey! No one out there sets foot in this house, and that's final. Now it's not my fault, that the one couch tramping out in the snow. - Daddy, you're not serious. - Haywood! Haywood! The evening's taken its toll, it's understandable. You're just upset. - I'm not upset! I'm sick and tired of people telling me what to do, in my own house. [Men] Open the door! - Mrs. Dutton! - Mother! (feet stamping) (door opens) - We're all right. - I don't believe it. - Everything's going to be all right, Mary Margaret. Sam, can you help me get her inside? (people conversing quietly) (door slams) - Mary Margaret! - Mary Margaret. (soothing piano music) - Where's Joe. (door opens) Joe! (laughs) (classical somber music) (crowd chattering quietly) - It's the face sir. - Little fan, let's tip Fennel odds in favor of our boy. (classical music) (match stick ignites) - Everybody's candle should be lit Mr. Kennely. (air whooshing) - What the! Don't I know you from som place? - Why don't you come back to the house sir? - No Bridges. Joe, I didn't realize, Mary Margaret- I'm sorry Joe. I've been wrong about so many things. Please, forgive me. - I'm sorry too dad. (classical piano music) - Please, come inside. - What about my friends? - Oh, they're welcome too. Everybody's welcome. - What about Fennel Street? - I'm not going to sell. (crowd shouting) Come inside everybody, you're all invited to the party. And Merry Christmas. (classical jovial music) - Come on! (classical jovial music) (whistle blowing) (classical jovial music continues) (engine stops) - Mr. Dutton, I can explain everything. - Save your lies for the judgment. I have no time for them. My daughter-in-law is having her baby in the den, and I don't wanna miss it. So kindly get this jalopy out of my driveway, or I will feed you to those people inside. (door slams) - Drive you're stupid! (engine roaring) - Leaving Church Field? - The deal's off! I won't forget this Dutton. (Haywood laughing) (footsteps fading) (classical jovial music) (door opens) (door slams) (classical jovial music continues) (people clapping) (baby crying) - It's a girl. (baby crying) - It's a girl. (baby crying) (door slams) - Forgive me? (Frances laughs) - How now you've doubted this time Kinnely. I wouldn't blame Haywood Dutton if he were to lock you up the grill. - I swear, I don't remember a thing, except that little girl lighting my candle. (match stick ignites) (classical jovial music) - It's been quite a day, aren't Jamie? - Hmm hmm. (classical jovial music continues) (men laughing) - Molly! I'm to open the presents. Jamie, what are you doing here all by yourself? (feet stamping) Where's Molly? - There. (door opens) - Merry Christmas Molly! (classical jovial music)
