- I'm so excited. - I'm so excited too. This one looks so nice here. Yeah, it is a sign, people. Alright, kids. Come on. Come on out. I have some. Thanks. I'm not sure this is a good idea. It'll be fine, honey. Relax. He lives here? That's what he said. It must be up there. I can't wait till Santa Claus brings my gift! You mailed my letter, didn't you, Daddy? Of course, sweetie. Of course. Last one there is a rotten egg! - And that's you! - Slowly. How can you still believe in Santa? That stuff is for babies. I know that Santa Claus exists and right now he's crazy busy with his helper elves. Yeah. Of course. Maybe he's not home. We should go up the staircase. I don't know why we'd need an escape hatch, Tony. Vince wouldn't be looking at five to ten right now. That was bad luck. Vince got pinched for an old crime. I really miss him. No, no, no, no. You don't know who it is. That's why we answer the door, so we can see who it is. - It might be the cops. - We aren't thieves anymore, okay? - Try telling that to Vince. - Well, I'll tell you one thing about Vince. He wouldn't be peeing his pants if someone knocked at the door. That's why I've been the lookout for the past 15 years, alright? You just stay in your lane. Let me do my job. - Okay. Answer it. - Want me to answer the door? - Permission granted. - Okay, okay. Hi, uncle Frank! Hello, kiddos! I'd like to introduce you to Tony. Hi, uncle Tony! - Alright. - Oh, uncle Tony! I told you, you got nothing to worry about. - It's good to see you. - Look what I brought. Oh, my gosh. It's our favorite book. Puffins? Listen, take it over to the couch, and I'll be over there in a minute. Um, do you guys have a minute? We, uh, we need to talk. We have an emergency. Of course. Of course. Sure. Take a seat. What's up? Okay. Let's do it upstairs. We already moved the bombs up to over there, so don't... No, that... Hey. Please. After you. Oh, no. This is empty. It's empty. So, what's the occasion? Frank and Tony, would you mind doing us a huge favor? - Sure. - Would it be okay to look after Liam and Olivia just for a couple hours? We need to do some last minute shopping. - Please? - Oh, that'd be great! That'd be so much fun! - Thank you. - This is a bless. We can teach them how to toss the dice. - Play the ponies. - Seriously? Peter, that's ancient history. Yeah, history. Exactly. History. You and Vince, you promised me you'd turned over a new leaf. Tony promised too. Look what I got us. We're unemployed. Hey, you know what could be fun? We could teach the kids to pick a pocket. You know, uh, hot-wire a car, crack a safe. That's not going to happen. - No. Listen. You guys go shopping. Don't worry about a thing. The kids will be safe here with us. We're going to show them some good old fashioned - Christmas cheer! - Thank you! - Thank you so much. - Thanks, guys. We appreciate it. Yeah, thanks really. Uh, cops! - Now it's my turn! - Oh, - that's my lucky balaclava! - Hey, hey, hey - I'm sorry. - Hey, what are you, a bunch of wild animals here? Come on. - Oh, this. - Sorry. This one didn't rip. That's actually my ski mask, okay? Hey, it's a good thing you didn't bust that one, because if you did, you wouldn't be able to stay with uncle Tony as your babysitter today. Hooray! We're going to stay with uncle and uncle. Too bad uncle Vince is not here. I just hope he's having fun in the Caribbean. - Oh, he's having fun, alright. - Oh, my gosh. Vince is having so much fun in the Caribbean. Right? He's there with his buddies, you know. Hanging out. He'll be back. - One day. On good behavior. - Hey, hey, what gives? We got rules here, huh, kid, come on. Come on. Off the couch. Off the couch. - Come on. - Uncle Frank said we had no rules. I did say there are no rules, except follow the rules at mom and dad's house. - Great. Come here. - Yeah. Big story behind this couch. One night, we're in Vegas, - we picked up a couple of broads and... - -Hey, that's a great story. We're going to go. - Yes. We should go. - Yeah, okay, you go. Look what I found! Yeah. Yeah, oh, okay. Yeah. That's a crowbar. That's not a big deal. I'm sure you have a crowbar at your house. I'm sure you have one at home too. What's this? Okay, those are professional bolt cutters. Which, uh, you can borrow anytime. Because not everybody has these. Don't worry, guys. Your kids are - in good hands. - Yeah. Okay. Well, you be safe, - all four of you. - Yeah, - okay. Thank you. - Love you! Bye! - Be good, please. - Bye! Bye, gorgeous! - Bye, mommy. - Toodles! - Okay, alright. Bye. - Toodles! - Bye, uncle Tony. - Bye, Bob. Oh, thank you. Liam, Olivia. Let me teach you a thing or two. Come on over here. - Okay. - Tools of the trade. - Have some fun! - Alright. You got your crowbar, your bolt cutters, your blowtorch. You know what these are for here? I don't like that we're leaving them alone again this Christmas too. We're not leaving them alone. Anyway, last Christmas, they had a blast. Ha! They did, and... - you made peace with your brother Frank. - -Exactly. And not one, but two uncles that they adore. But I just wish you'd remember to get the gifts. What? The gifts again? Come on. We'll be there in a flash. I know a shortcut. We'll miss the traffic. Okay. This is because your uncle Frank is a world class crack safe. Let's check Olivia's letter and see what she wants for Christmas. Liam's easy. He wants a Star Shuttle whatchamacallit. You didn't lose her letter, did you? It must to be here somewhere. Just like you lost my police badge. I had the letter. I showed you the letter. I feel like I can't ever trust you. It must have fallen out of my pocket. Watch out! Are you okay? Yeah. All okay. - Hm. - Okay. What was that? Hey, pay attention here. Pay attention, alright? You got to spin and hear the click. I have to ask my parents to buy me one. You could've asked Santa in a wish letter. Are you still rattling on about that garbage? Santa Claus does not exist. Are you okay? Hey. Oh, for crying out loud. That was a serious blow. Dasher, Prancer, Blitzen, Vixen! Where in the blazes are you? Cupid? Rudolph! Aww, get back here, you pea-brained flying goats! - Tony! How dare you! - What? What I do? What, what's wrong with you? I'm the safe cracker! I'll teach you guys. Here you go, yeah. Listen, sir. If there's somewhere you need to be, we can, we, we can give you a ride. This? I don't think so. Besides, serious plan B. And I'd say you've done enough damage already. Wunorse Openslae, I've had an accident. No, I'm fine. But the reindeer panicked and flew away. I need you to send somebody to pick me up right away. Send, uh, Bushy Evergreen with sleigh number two. It's out of order? Okay, ah! Send Jimmy Snow with his flying van. What are you talking about he's on vacation? Who authorized his holiday on the 24th of December? Oh. I did. You can't be serious. Ugh! She, she never could get here in time to pick me up. What do you mean she deserves another chance? No. Not her! She's not reliable. She's totally unreliable. She'll never make it in time. Is somebody coming to pick you up? It's an unmitigated disaster. Is that Santa Claus? Whoever it is, nobody open the door. I got it. Frankie, what are you do... Frankie! It could be the cops. Frankie! What are you doing? Mm-hmm. - Oh... - Oh! Oh! - Frank, what are you doing? Come on! - I got it. Frankie! You don't like strangers in the house. You bring strange women home every weekend. That's a good point. Hey, listen, she could be a cop. What about all the loot we got stashed in here? No! She must be one of Santa's elves. Elf? Get real. - Hey. A little help? - Yeah, I'll give you a little help. - Here we go. Right this way, ma'am. - Oh, oh. - Right this way, come on. - No, no! It's cold out there! - Go back in... - No, no, no. Frank. I got this. - I'm not letting her go. - Frank! Uncle Tony, if you kick her out, I'm going to scream. Uncle, uncle, uncle. Okay. - Relax. Lighten up, okay? - Alright. - I won't throw her out. - Yeah. Come on, we'll go over here. - Right over here. - Yeah, we got you. - This way. - That way. Hey, let's make her comfortable right here. - Okay, come on. - Nice and comfortable. Hey, hey, hey. - Yeah. - Hey. You okay? Huh? - We're sorry. - You okay? Hey. Alright. Make yourself at home. Hey, let's see if her heart is beating. Look at the bash on her head! You two kids get out of here. Upstairs. Let's go. Come on, until we figure this out, alright? I already told you, she's an elf. Let's go. Hey. You see what I see? Yeah. Nice jewelry. I wonder if she's wealthy. Some nice gems right there. Sir, are you okay? Do you need medical attention? A doctor? That's just what I need. I'm running late enough as it is. Can't you see all the presents I, I have to deliver? Oh... Rudolph. Oh... Rudolph. I knew you wouldn't abandon me. Rudolph. You think you can pull the sleigh by yourself? Huh? Uh... Guess not. Hello? Hello? How are you? She doesn't wake up. Now what? I'll wake her up. Trust me. No! What? No violence. I'm going to boil up a pot of my special spices. That'll get her going. Or kill her even faster. You don't like her, do you? - I don't like strangers. - You don't like anyone. Bingo. Hey! Get your mitts off of that book! Where am I? Who are you? Relax. I am Frank. And this is Tony. We found you unconscious outside that door and saved your life. Now we spilled our beans, how about you? What gives, huh? What gives? Uh... I don't know who I am. I can't remember a thing. Likely story. I believe you. All I know is that I have something to do. I have something very important. Urgent! Would you like a cup of spices? - Um... - What are you, Martha Stewart? I wish. What? What's next? Essential oils? You'll never, ever have my essential oil! I got to ask. What exactly are you doing out here? I stopped here so they could fill up. And they need a ton of water to go all the way around the world. In this fog? I created it so nobody would see me. What is this book? You wouldn't believe who gave us this book last year. Hey. Thought you had a bruise on your head. I did. Maybe the book holds a solution to understand who I am. Well, it is a very special book. - And I'd be honored to read it to you. - Yeah? I got a better idea. What do you say we give this lovely lady - a tour of the house. - Yeah. Shall we? Right this way, okay? Here's our lovely kitchen. And over here is Frankie's bedroom. - Here's the door. - Oh. - No! No, no, no! - Oh, no. - Now she's gone! She's gone! - No. - She's gone, Frank! - No! - Let go! - No, you don't! - I was... - Hey! Would you throw a woman out on the street with memory loss? - Who are you talking to? - Okay. Just let me read her one story. Frank. Do it for the kids, Tony. Of course, the kids. - One story. - Thank you. She woke up, but she can't remember anything. The knock on her head must have made her lose her memory. We might as well tell her. She's an elf! That's enough already, Olivia. I'll prove to you that she's not an elf. This way you'll stop pestering everyone with your silly stories! Okay. Go ahead and get all grumpy. When you find out that I'm right, and you're wrong! I guess I lost my power with the crash. I think he's had a concussion. Let's call 911. Dasher! Prancer! Blitzen, Vixen! We're late! - Look at that! - Kids? Hey, quit the roughhouse. - Come on. Get, get in here. Let's go. - Hey, hey, hey. Give me some. Give me some. I'm Liam. I know. And you're Olivia. How do you know their names? We didn't tell you nothing. I don't know. I do. You know all the names of the children - because you're an elf. - You know what? This whole thing stinks to high heaven. We're going to read this book now, and then little miss know-it-all is going to take a powder, okay? I wonder what stories there are this time. What do you mean? The stories always change. It's a very special book. - No. I don't believe it. - Alright, kids. Keep your ears open. We got to figure out who this sweet lady is. Here we go. Oh... The book is weird. The Puffins. Didi. Her hair ties are so cute. Pie! Super-duper-powerful Pie! Didi, Pie. I've heard these names before. Tic and Tac. Or Tic tock. Like a ticking bomb. Hmm. Ugh! There's Otto. Playing his tricks again! And with Johnny Puff, we're finished with the introductions. You're very acquainted with the characters! - Some we even know in person. - Really? - Yes. - It's a long story. It is. But I'll tell it one of these days. Hey! Look at Didi. - She's telling us something. - Mm-hmm. Yeah, like, let's wrap this up. It's killing me. Well, then, let's begin. Oh, no! Poor Didi! She feels sick. Ugh. The blueberries must've been poisonous! There's no such thing as poisonous blueberries. Brrr! Don't panic. Her friends are going to take her to... Ta-da! Johnny Puff! - Ma... -Yes! - Keep calm, Didi! You have to trust your friends! Ma! - Ah! - Hmm? Hey, Johnny Puff uses Boy Scout first aid techniques. - Aah! - But Didi still has a bellyache. Unless she was faking it. Hmm? Hmm? Huh? You didn't wake me up like that when I fainted, did you? No. You got lucky. Frankie boy here stopped me. - Whoa! - Aah! Oh, no. There's nothing more that can be done. Poor Didi. Wait! Johnny Puff has a plan. - What's that? - A giant syringe! No! It's an alien brain-sucker. Or a phony-baloney meter, which we could use right about now. Hurray! She got better all on her own! Or maybe she never got sick in the first place. Mm-hmm. Aah! Ooh! The end. Thank God. Oh, I've got a bellyache too. Maybe I ate too much popcorn. Oh, no. Hey, hey. What are you doing with the kid? Hands off him. Wow! All better. How did you do that? I, I don't know actually. Hey, did you change your hair? It looks different. - Uh, me? No, why? No. - Well... Thank you. Magic! What did I tell you? - You're a... - A doctor! It's obvious! Look, Olivia, I'll prove it to you! Maybe you can give someone a quick check-up, - something will click. - Oh, yes! - And your memory will come back. - Oh, yes. What? Examine me, please. - Okay. - Whoa, whoa, Where you going with that, sister? Tony, maybe I'm a doctor. A doctor, huh? Give her a chance, Tony. For real? Yeah. Your funeral. - Okay. - Okay, here we go. Let me try. Alright. Ow! I'm sorry! - I'll help... - Oh, oh, gosh. - I'm sorry. - Some doctor. I'll bet she just won the Nobel prize in medicine. Huh? Frank, can we chat in private, please? Uncle Tony, can you give me more lemonade? - Sure thing, kid. - Oh, for me too, please. I'd like something to sweeten me up. What do I look like, a butler? Maybe you're not a doctor, but you were terrific. - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. - Really? Thank you, Liam. But there's a little voice inside of me that keeps saying that I have to do something, but I can't remember what. A little voice inside my head tells me you need to get lost. Hey, uncle Tony. Lemonade! Chop-chop! - Frank! - Okay! God... - darn it! - That's right. Show. Get in here. I figured out who she is. - Great! Let's go tell her. - Wait. - She's a swindler. - Oh. You mean like Didi who wasn't really sick? That, that's exactly right! Look, the clues in the book are crystal clear! This babe is pretending that she lost her memory. And she's playing it all cute with us. So she can win us over and then... ...stab us in the back! I don't like back-stabbers one bit! Yeah, well, trust me, we lookouts, we got pretty good instincts about these things. Really? We got no signal. Nothing. No reception. Sir, could we use your cell phone as you have signal? Just so long as you don't break it too. Thanks. Yeah, we need an ambulance. We've had an accident. What? There's an order of gingerbread men that needs to be paid for. How much? Listen, I'm sorry. I think I must have dialed the wrong number. I, I don't even like gingerbread. - That was weird. - Let me try. Let me try it. - 911. - Yeah. Hello. I'm Emma Wallace, and we've had an accident. What? What do I care if red on green looks better than green on red? No. I've told you a thousand times. Red on green is perfect. Even if not everybody agrees with me. So, any news? She should be here by now. I'll believe it when I see her. Do you, do you need some help? Oh, I can do it on my own. I always have. Here you go. Oh! Oh, it's sour! - What? - It's gross! You know, she seems pretty honest for a lady that's playing all sweet and cute just so she can stab us in the back. If you ask me, it's good. Delicious. Hey, Tony. Get our lady friend some sugar. Yeah. You can forget about that. I'm staying right here. Can you read to us, uncle Tony? You got it, kiddo. - Wow! - Whoa! It's pretty cool. Pie's telling us to read this one. Aren't they cold underwater? It's a safe. Hey, you better hope those little birdies can bring that all the way to the surface, and get their hands on all that cash, huh? Aah! Puffins are being spied on! By Otto! He's scheming something up. Good luck with that. The team. You have to have faith in yourself, guys. Mm-hmm. - It's here. - Oh, thank you. Speaking of teams. Hey, hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go easy on the sugar! Let go... Give me that! It's still a little bit on the sour side, but good. Of course she likes sugar so much because she's... She has a big sweet tooth. Come on. Let's see how the story ends. So let me get this straight. The puffins brought the safe to the surface, but... Whoa, whoa! Be careful down there. What a catch! I mean, Otto's got some crew, huh? All he needs now is a good lookout, of course. Uncle Tony, you're not supposed to cheer for them. Now what? Way to go. Hm, who's going to win the safe? Come on. Otto, of course. He's the strongest. But that's not fair. He's a thief! A thief, huh? Olivia just gave me a great idea. What? To open the safe? Because Otto there, he's having a real tough time. No. And the safe is open. Oh, boy. There's nothing inside though. Enough with that. You can go now. - Hmm. - Hey, uncle Tony. Can you give us some more lemonade? Please? Please. Help yourself. It's in the kitchen. Tony had no money. He was, like, raised in the streets. So I said, "Hey..." Hey, uncle Frank. What do you say we take advantage of this little break and go do some laundry? We just did laundry, Tony. In October. Yeah. It's December. - That was just two months ago. - Hm. What a kidder. This guy, what a joker, right? Hey, I'll tell you what, we'll be right back. Okay? I mean, in a good long while. Okay. And you take whatever time you need to do whatever it is you do, alright? - Okay. - Ugh. - Oh, my gosh. - Frank? - Okay. Alright. - Laundry. I'll be back. Um... She's adorable, right? So, you want to borrow some clean underwear? Gross. Then why are we doing laundry? - Hmm. - Because... I got a plan. Okay. - I'll explain. - Okay. - Oh, geez! - What are you doing? Where's all the laundry? Please. That was the excuse to set my trap. You saw what Otto did, right, huh? - He opened the safe. - No, no, no, no. Before that. Before that! He tried to steal it. Don't you get it? He's a thief. That's the clue. He's a thief. She's a thief. Got it? Nobody steals on Christmas Eve. - Frank. - Okay. Okay. Anyway. Listen. I set the bait. Now we're going to see if she takes a nibble. I knew it. I knew it! - Caught red-handed. Yes! - Oh! What? You knew it. Caught red-handed. Caught red-handed! You're out of this! You're out of this house! - Right out of here! - Why? Because we know who you are. - Honey, we know who you are. - Who am I? You're a thief! - A thief? - Yeah. But I didn't steal anything. How about my wallet that was right there about two minutes ago? Huh, huh? Oh. Well, isn't it there in your pocket? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. How did you do that? I don't know. Don't ever question this honorable woman's integrity again. Oh, Frankie-boy, thank you so much! You're a constant source of trust and hope. - I know. I know. - Oh. But, but the truth is, I feel I'm doing everything wrong, you know, I, I feel I'm in the wrong place. - I should be somewhere else. - Stop. You are kind. You're clever. Whoever you are, whatever you do, it's amazing. I can't take this. Please. You can't expect me... You know what? We're going to finish reading this book, so you can get on to your urgent commitments. Kids! Enough lemonade. Come on! Uncle Frank's going to read another story. Sorry about that. He's just crabby because he doesn't have any clean underwear. Oh. How many presents are there? You do the math. At least one for every child. And they wonder why I always have a backache. He's a bit nuts. But I don't think he's dangerous. I don't think he's nuts. Tony, join us. I'm about to read another story. Oh, I can't wait. But the question is, which one? Wow! Pretty cool. Tac decided for us! This book keeps getting weirder and weirder. - What a great balloon! - I wonder who it belongs to. To Tac and the others who are following him! And like all beautiful things in life, sooner or later... Boom! Oh. Way to go, puffins! Ah, aah. Hey! Hey, Otto's the one handing out the balloons. I told you he's a good guy. Good guy? What're you talking about? It's a swindle! I don't see how the story of a double-dealing Walrus can help me figure out who I am. Well, I do. It's a trap! Otto's doing everything he can to lure the Puffins into his den. And he's pulling it off. Oh, no! Don't go in! It's dangerous! This time Otto is really close to winning. Well, all good plans have a weakness. Or somebody who's too smart to fall for it. You're right, uncle Tony! It serves you right, Otto! Good teamwork. What is going on? Uncle Frank! It's Otto's balloon. - Thank you, Puffins. - Give me that thing. Hey, kids. Who wants a balloon, huh? Come play with it. - Who wants the big red balloon? - Me! Come and get it! - Go fetch. - Ah. - I got it! - Frank? Step into my office. Uh, I can't wait to hear what uncle Tony thinks... - ...this clue means. We're up! - Let me, let me see! No! It's mine! - No! - Give me that! - Let me see! - No, it's mine! No! No! Goodbye, balloon. Thank you, thank you. You were there, and then you were here. How did you do that? - I don't know. - Hyper-speed! With all the gifts they have to deliver, it's an important skill... No! I get it. You work in a circus! Let's see if any circuses in town have lost an acrobat. - Maybe we can use the phone. - Good idea. Go for it! I'm so sorry. Frank, the book tells the story. She's definitely a kidnapper. We got to get rid of her. She's not a kidnapper. Have you seen her face? She wouldn't harm a fly. Did you fall for that? Come on. You know the angel faces are the most evil. Take a look at yours truly. Okay, we can't kick her out without proof. Trust me. I got a plan. Oh, you do... What's your plan? We can't leave the kids out there with a potential kidnapper. That is the plan. We leave her with the kids, she tries to kidnap them, boom. We have all the proof we need. Well, what if she actually kidnaps them? Please, one false move, I'll knock her into next week. Now we just sit and wait. Right? Just like the good old days when I used to be lookout. Yeah. You know, hey, I got an idea. Vince gets out, we get the boys in the band back together, boom. - I miss Vince, yeah. That'd be nice. - Hm. Or if we do get arrested, - then we could end up with Vince in the jail. - Hm. I like plan A. Waiting right here. Okay, we've waited long enough. Let's go! Hey! - Gone. - What did I tell you? She waited for a moment of chaos, boom. She kidnapped the kids. Oh, no. Oh, no, I got to call my brother. He's going to be so mad. Just like I told you. The angel faces are always the most evil. Okay, what? It's going to be a long time - before he trusts us to babysit again. - I'll say. His phone's out of range! Where do you think she took them? How could all of those presents possibly fit in this sack? It's getting late though, huh? We better go. Oh, she's not going to make it. I'll never manage to deliver two billion two hundred and thirty-four million three hundred and fifty-nine thousand five hundred and thirteen... ...five hundred and fourteen. A baby was just born. Should we offer him a ride? And the reindeer? I'll call a patrol car when we get to town. They should be able to take care of it. Would you like a ride, sir? Uh... Geez, in all the confusion, we didn't even introduce ourselves. I'm Pete. Pete Wallace. This is my wife Emma. Nice to meet you. You are? You know exactly who I am. Even though you don't believe in me anymore. And that's a real shame. For instance, have you ever asked yourself why you buy all these presents? I take care of that. Hasn't that sunk in? I'm usually all "Ho ho ho!" But you have to understand, this, the situation is a little more than dramatic. We'll give you a ride. - I expected it to be heavier. - Yeah? She hasn't shown up yet. What do you mean you don't know where she is anymore? I knew it. Can't trust anybody. - Oh, oh! - Hey, wait! Stop the car! Ahh! Come on. You'll flood the engine! - Get out of the car! - I knew it. No car is as good as a sleigh. Oh! You're here! Thank you. Mwah! Oh! Yes. Why? There's nothing to play with over there. And all of a sudden we were here. Next to this. How did we do that? - Magic! What did I tell you? - Mm-hmm. Well, if you are a magician, maybe you can fix my lucky ski mask. - This is my mask. - She's not a magician. That's what I'm trying to tell you! She's an elf! I didn't hear nobody move. How's that? Maybe you need a hearing aid. I see perfect. That's why I'm the best in the business. Oh, if you can see so well, then you can read this to us. Yay! Hey, get lost! Out of here, okay? I choose the story. Okay! I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I guess we'll go with this one here. Tic wants to show us what a great magician he is! That trick could help us with our Christmas dinner problem. Our refrigerator is empty. Ah-ha! And now he'll need another volunteer. Me! Me! No! Let's see what happens. Vanished! Way to go, Tic! Uh-oh! Tac's not coming back anymore! Tic, don't mess around. Make him come back! Don't worry, Olivia. Didi and Pie will make Tac reappear! Looks like Didi disappeared too. Pie, you're our last hope! Aah! Now what? The Puffins are going to need help from a real magician! Me? Yes. You have to use your magic. You only need to remember that you're... - A Magician! Great idea, Olivia! - No, I said an... This will explain how suddenly we found ourselves in the bedroom without us even noticing! If she's a magician, then maybe she can pull a disappearing act. Yes! I'm sorry to disturb you so much. - Yeah. - You know, maybe I should just go. No, no, no. Don't listen to him. Let's see how the story ends. Tic called Johnny Puff! Poor guy. We have to trust Johnny Puff. He'll make everything right. Ha! Well, they're safe and sound. Oh, boy. You feel any calmer, Tony? I'm not buying it. Johnny Puff is going to do a magic act. Oh. I think it's a raid! We got to get out of here! Come on, Olivia. Where we going? To our secret escape tunnel. Right in here. Cool. Right in here. Alright, I'm innocent. - Oh. - Um... Oh, there's no cops. There's no cops. What, what are you doing with that... ...box of skinny clothes? I figure that if she's really a magician, performing a trick could help her click her memory back into action. That's solid thinking there, son. - You know... - You go in here. - In there? - Yeah. You go in there. Disappear if you can. Then we'll know. - Oh! - Okay, easy! - Okay. - Slowly, I'm... Alright. Are you still in there? - I'm stuck! - Now what? When you open this, if she's gone, she's a magician. But if she's here, she's not a magician. - Ah, okay. - Hey, careful. Slow, slow, slow. - What's the verdict? - She's stuck. - She's stuck? Okay. - She's not a magician. Okay. Come on out, then. Oh! Hold up. Oh, gosh! Oh, my gosh! There you go! Okay! - Oh, gosh! - There. - Okay, thank you. - Yeah. - Oh, my gosh. - I was stuck. Thank you. Well, the battery seems okay, so, um... I don't know. Maybe it's the sparkplugs. I'll fix it. Well, don't... Don't touch anything! You see? Do you know anything about engines? I know a lot about reindeer. Exactly. I need a spark plug wrench. Merry Christmas! Seriously? Ah, you got to be kidding me. If you got a torch down there as well, that'd be great. I can't see anything out here. Merry Christmas again. Hey! You know, I like Rudolph. How's it going with the car? Good. Great. You're not a magician. I guess not. And you're such an angel, Frankie boy. Hey. Why didn't nobody tell us it was a false alarm, huh? I thought you were playing hide and seek. Uncle Frank, I found these in the secret passage. You can wear these instead of the one that got ripped. Right? Oh, sure, honey. But no ski mask will ever replace my first one, you know. In my heart. Thank you, though. You're welcome. Oh! Oh... Oh, my God. I think you're right about doing laundry. Smell this. Ooh! Smells like cat piss! Frank, you got to get this broad out of your head. I told you already. She isn't interested. She could be interested. I have a lot of charisma. You sure do, Frankie boy. You're a charmer. It all makes perfect sense now actually. She's pretended to be cracked in the head all because she's so madly in love with you. - You think so? - No. Tell you what. I'll bet you a dollar, by the end of the next story, she asks me out. - Make it five. - You got it. - Deal. - Yeah. Got it. Like taking candy from a baby. And on our date, I'm going to wear my high-school jeans. She couldn't even get those on. I'm going to wash them first. Time to read, kiddies. Yay! Because I got a bet to win. Ooh! Pretty. Ooh. Hey. This time Johnny Puff is going to tell us which story to read. Hey, maybe this time we'll figure out who you really are. Oh! Yeah, because so far, the stories chosen by the Puffins haven't told us very much. Yeah. Still, I was sure the answer was in there. But we have to hurry before it's too late. Even if I can't remember for what. Well, the sooner we read, the sooner I get my money. I, I mean, we figure all this out for you. Oh. Yeah. I wonder what diabolical plan Otto has in mind this time? What's that? A gigantic drill. - Cool. - Oh! It's noisy. And really smokey. How gross! Hey, check it out. It looks like night's falling over Taigasville! It's not darkness, it's smog! Really? Somebody stop Otto! He's making everything stinky! Yeah, it looks like Vince's old apartment. That was stinky too. But I bet he wishes he was there right now. They're cooking up a plan to stop Otto. A gamma ray cannon? An atomic magnet? What will they invent for themselves? There's the plan! Using solar panels! Brilliant idea! Mm-hmm. Hm? Oh! That's not right! Otto's polluting everything! What's going on? The smoke is coming from the book! Let's go into the secret passage! Enough smoke! Nice. Olivia! It's all clear! Olivia! Yeah, kids, let's go. We got a... We got a story to finish. - Where did all the smoke go? - Oh, my gosh, you should've seen it. It was so smokey... Frank! Let's do this, shall we? Here's Johnny Puff! They went to warn him! Hey! What's he got going? He's calling in reinforcements. Look at all them birdies, huh? If the Puffins have faith in Johnny Puff, then we need to believe in him too. Mm-hmm. Huh? Oh! Oh, that is so cool! They're sending all the smoke back to Otto. - Good going! - Yeah! What goes around comes around! That's right. I said that too. Poor puffins! - Wow! - Whoa! The end. - Hey, Olivia. Let's go play with the safe. - Yeah. Now that's a man after my own heart. And in the end, Otto will have to pay all the damages! I really like that story. Justice was served. Frankie boy knows a thing or two about serving justice. I serve a lot of justice. We must all respect the law. Oh, I have so much respect for the law. Just like Vince. Looking at five to ten. You know, sometimes I respect the law, and serve justice at the same time. - Really? - Oh, yeah. At this point, it's hopelessly late. I knew I shouldn't have trusted her. I can't trust anybody. Not even you. - A car! - Hey! Hey! Hey! Excuse me. Good evening, sir. Our car broke down. Oh, I'm sorry to hear about that. - We just really need a lift. - Well, I don't know. Hm... - I don't even know you. - Can you just give us a... Horace. You know who I am. I need your car. Get out. Hey! Whoa! Everything will be okay. I know it. First, there was my lost badge, and then Olivia's letter, and now this crazy guy. And we're going to be spending Christmas eve without our children again this year. Hey. Was there something you forgot to ask me? No. I, I don't think so. Something, uh, we were going to do together? It was your idea? No. No. I don't think so. No. Like I said, taking candy from a baby. It's chocolate! Uncle Tony, can I have one too? Sure thing, kid. - Hey, can I have one too? - Sure, kid. Thanks! Hey, can I have some more? There are no more in the house. I hid some under the eaves so Tony wouldn't find them. Hey! Save some for me too, okay? Okay! Did you remember what you wanted to ask me? Actually, I do. I'd love some sweets! - Some sweets. - Mm-hmm. - There you go. - No. More sweets. Lots of sweets. That ought to take care of it. Tell you what we're going to do. I'm going to go in the kitchen with Frankie boy here, and we're going to make you a peanut butter and sugar sandwich with so much sugar on it it's going to look like a volcano. Yes! Yes! Thanks! - I'd love that. - Uncle Frankie and I will take care of that for you right now, isn't that right, Frankie? Peanut butter and sugar sandwiches are my specialty. - Oh, Frankie. - Yeah. Well, - I love... - Frank! You still owe me five bucks! Let's go. - Can I take a look at your book? - Sure. Maybe you're a fire woman. You were the one who opened the window somehow, right? No. I don't, I don't know. I just opened the window because I thought it would be useful to get the smoke out, but... Oh! Careful! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Alright, little by little, we'll figure out who you are. You have to be patient. That's what my dad always says. Patient. I wish. I'm full of anxiety. Oh, I'm sorry. It's good for me to be here with you and all the others, and even that old grumble-guts of Tony. But I have to do something. I really feel I have to do something. She's definitely strange. She cured my bellyache without medicine. Somehow, she moved me and Olivia from the living room to the bedroom without us even noticing. And now, she opened the windows with her mind. Who is she? She says the answer is in the book. But where? Didi, I already read that story. I need to look for clues that can... Ah! I got it! The "S" that starts the story. "S"? That means the letters themselves are the clues! Okay. Tell me who she is already. You saw how pissed she got because of the way Otto treated the Puffins. So what? It's obvious she's a cop, right? She's here to make sure we're on our best behavior! Otherwise, how would she know the names of Olivia and Liam, huh? And that explains why she's being playing cutesy with you! - Does it? - Hm. Why else would she flirt with you? Now go in there and be super polite and give her anything she wants. Alright. I'm going to go in there, and be super polite and give her anything she wants. Perfect! Then she'll put in a good word with the parole board, and we'll finally be done with all of this. Is that it then? Is that why you're so sweet with me, Frankie-boy? So, you admit you're a cop, huh? I don't know who I am. All I know is that I don't want to be here anymore. There's the door. Fine. I'll get my hat, and then I'll go. What about your sandwich? - What do you got against cops? - Hey. - My sister in law's a cop! - Frankie, baby, you're getting soft on me, alright? She's a cop. You're going to get us locked up. Come on. Get tough. Where are you going? I'm going away. I'm sorry. Well, you can't go away. You're an... No. Whatever you think I am, it's not true. I'm a big nothing. You're Santa Claus's elf! Why are you leaving? You promised me you were going to help me figure out who I am. I trusted you. Instead, you're just like Tony. You happy now? What a shame. Oh, my gosh! Olivia was right! Olivia! You were right! No. You were right. Santa Claus doesn't exist. Look at all that loot, huh? You may wind up in the family business after all. Oh, no! What's that? What happened? Where's the elf lady? Oh, no, don't you start that too, okay? She's gone. Finally. This, this is the letter that Olivia wrote to Santa Claus. Oh, no. Daddy must've lost it! Uncle Tony, call him right away. Meanwhile, I'll see what she wants. I'll give him a ring later. It's a disaster. Why? What am I going to do? Olivia can't stop believing in Christmas. - I thought that's what you wanted. - Yes. But it was a mistake. And now I feel guilty. You'll get over it. Look, uncle Tony, I don't have time to explain it to you, but trust me, that woman, she's Santa Claus's elf. You sure about that? - Yeah. - You know, that could explain all the sugar in the lemonade. I hear elves got some sweet tooth. Take this. Find her and give it to her. This way she'll deliver it to Santa Claus - and Olivia can have her gift. - Kid, kid, kid. Give me a break. It's already too late. It's Christmas eve. What do you say we just stay here full of guilt, nice and cozy. Please, uncle Tony? Who can say no to a face like that. You owe me one, kid. Thank you, uncle Tony. Ever since you guys ripped this, all my good luck has run out. Just give me a sign. Please give me a sign. Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh! Is this a sign? No. But maybe reading it will cheer us up a little. Hey, where you going? Come on. Don't do this! You're going to go outside, it's freezing out there. - Don't do that. Come on back upstairs! - No! Hey, listen. I'm sorry, alright? I was wrong about you being a cop. You know, and that's the only reason that Frankie's not sweet on you right now. You know? But I can tell you one thing. He thinks you're real, real special. No. I'm a real disaster area. That's not true! You're honest. You're great with kids. You, you can cure a bellyache with just a touch of your hand. And you're the world's greatest fire lady. - Those are only coincidences. - Listen to me. I don't know how much I believe this, but Liam told me to tell you that you're one of Santa's elves. What are you going on about? Now it sounds like you banged your head. I told you I don't know. But Liam sure does. Oh, hey, I almost forgot. Hey, he told me to give you this. I don't need it. I already know what it says. How do you know? How do I know? I know because I'm one of Santa's elves! - Oh! - Holy smokes! Liam was right! I remember everything now! Oh, no, I'm super late! I have to reach Santa right now! Right away! You wanna borrow my car? I mean, the clutch is a little sticky, but other than that, it runs pretty well. Oh, no, thank you, Tony. That won't be necessary. Don't mention it. Wow! Ugh! Hey. - Where you going? - To deliver my presents. Even if it takes till next Christmas eve. And I'll do it by myself as always. You don't trust people much, do you? Why should I? Give it a try. Your helper. She'll get here. For a man your age, you're awfully naive. Maybe if you met her, you'd understand. - Peter? - Mm? I was picking up my things in the car, and... Look what I found? Hey, your badge. My police badge. Forgive me. Forgive me for everything. I need to trust you, instead, I blamed it all on you, and all I needed to do was look a little harder. Come here. - I'm sorry. - That's okay. There, you see? Trust. They had a happy ending. At least they did. Uncle Frank and Olivia! I think you need to look outside! Frank, you got to see this, baby. It's going to blow your mind. Wow! What'd I tell you? - You're real. - Mm-hmm. So, I took off to help Santa deliver his presents, but I smashed into this huge seagull. And I know Santa doesn't really like me wearing... ...not being dressed like an elf, but you know, I think they wear such dorky clothes. And I feel much more original. Um, where was I? Um, oh, yes. So, I, I lost control during my landing and banged my head real hard against your door. How did your memory come back? Well, when Tony gave me Olivia's letter. But really, I think it's feeling your trust in me. You know, I've never been much for self-esteem. Eh, that's mostly my fault I suppose. Ugh, I've got to learn to stop trying to do everything by myself and start giving you elves more responsibility! I think it's time that I... ...let you wear this decorative outfit. Thank you! Really. So all's well that ends well, right? And it's all thanks to this book! And more precisely, in the first letter in each story! - You hear that, Frank? - I did. Our mistake was looking for the answers in the story. The Puffins were definitely trying to help us. Yeah, they were. Olivia, sweetie. How happy are you that you're going to get your gift directly from Santa Claus this year? Oh, he's the real present. What do you mean, Olivia? You got my letter! "Dear Santa Claus. This year as my present the only thing I really want is to meet you. And for my brother to see you, and admit that you exist." And you, Liam? What do you want for Christmas? I already got what I wanted. But I wouldn't mind a Galactic Star Shuttle. - Here you are, young man! - Oh! Ooh, there it is! Hang on. We'll open presents together, okay? Sure. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. And you. Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh Oh, it's my lucky ski mask! And it's good as new! Frankie, baby, we're back in business, yeah! Yeah! Uh, Santa, I think we should get going. Otherwise, you know, we're going to be late for the rounds. Yeah? Right. Listen, I was wondering if after you're done delivering gifts all over the world, maybe you and I could... I'll gladly accept. - Alright. - And you can call me Elfia, Frankie-boy. Elfia and Frankie-boy. I love it! Love it. - I like the sound of that! - Yeah. Are we ready? Goodbye, everyone! - Bye! - Adios! See you! Merry Christmas, everyone! Merry Christmas, everyone! Merry Christmas, everyone! Merry Christmas, everyone! Merry Christmas, everyone! Merry Christmas, everyone!
