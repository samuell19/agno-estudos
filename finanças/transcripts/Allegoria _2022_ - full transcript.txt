Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Me, me, maw, maw, me, me, maw. Me, maw, me, maw, me, maw, me maw, me, maw, me, maw, me, maw, me, maw, me, maw. Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga. Da, da, da, bah, bah, bah, ma, ma, ma, ma, rah, rah, rah, rah, fah, fah, fah, fah, da, da, da, da, da, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, me, me, me, me, moo. Do daily deeds diligently. Do daily deeds diligently. Do daily deeds diligently. I am the king. I am the king. I am the king! Don't ask "Who am I?" In those late night, too much tequila, self-serving, introspective moments with your eyes glazed over and your hands gripping the side of the sink and your forehead pressed against the mirror, don't you dare ask, "Who am I?" Ask "Who are you?" Because you means there is no awareness of self, and only through a total and complete lack of awareness of self can you find truth. And what is truth? And what is truth? Uh, reality? Reality is no more truth than truth is reality. Truth is an illusion, a contrivance designed to make you believe there is only one absolute answer. That's a reference to the Meisner technique, isn't it? No. This is not "I have a blue shirt, you have a blue shirt, I have a blue shirt, you have a fucking blue shirt" bullshit. No! This is not Meisner. This is not acting. This is hell. And hell is where you are. Today we birth the monster. The monster that populates all of us. Stand. Show me. What? I'm sorry. I guess I wasn't clear. - I'm sorry, I didn't... - No, no, no, please. It's my fault. I take full responsibility for your utter and complete lack of comprehension. Let me try again. Slowly. Show me the monster. Oh. Okay. Rarr! Rar. Terrifying. Don't bother. Take the stage. Don't waste my time with your childhood memories of the bogeyman or some Hollywood rubber suit abomination. I am not interested in that. I want more. I want you to plant your feet solidly on the rotting surface of this earth and allow the flames from the pits of hell to lick at your heels. I want the hot breath of a thousand rapists and murderers to enter you. Your legs grow heavy. As the filth rises higher, your knees swell with pain as the burning passes through and up, ripping and tearing at your genitals. This is getting weird. Silence! Your guts fill with the putrid stench from the bowels of Satan himself. And it feels wonderful. Your chest is hollow. A cavern, echoing the cries of every widow, slave, and cripple since the dawn of time. Your heart is black. A lifeless tumor. Yes. Yes. This is the monster I'm asking for. This is the monster I crave! Your neck is a snake choking on a carcass twice its size, stretched and bubbling over with the hot blood of its victim. Your face and head drip with slipping flesh. Only chips of rotten teeth and bulging blind eyes hang on a skull that is infested with maggots that have come to eat what's left of the empty, useless, pathetic souls of humanity. Whoo! Yeah. Whoo-hoo. What's wrong, sweetheart? Too much for you? Prefer the Meisner technique? I need you to look at me when I'm speaking. I said look at me. Hm. Hm. Okay. What? Marcus, it's Benny. Just calling to check on the status of the latest piece. It's Friday, and the client's getting pretty fucking antsy. Marcus? Marcus, can you hear me? I can hear you. Okay. Yeah, well, it's Friday, and you said that you would have it done by Friday. I'm sorry, I didn't realize my soul was punching a time clock. Hey, hey, come on. Don't act like you don't know how this works. Marcus? Marcus. Have you ever seen "The Harrowing of Hell" by Swanenburg? Uh, what's... What's that? Is that on Netflix? Why don't you go back to counting your pennies and let me finish? Okay. Okay. But just make sure that it's big. The client said they wanted something big. Apparently they have a lot of wall space, - you know what I mean? - Fuck off. Cha-ching, cha-ching, baby. - Fuck off. - I love you. What? Wow. As always, could you sound a little more excited? I'm having a difficult night. Okay. Well, I just wanted to tell you I got into that acting class. Cool. Yeah. It's tomorrow. He only, like, accepts a handful of people, so it's actually a pretty great deal. Why are you wasting your time with that shit? It's not art. It's pretend, really, I mean, you know. I'm over here struggling to sketch the flow that's already intact within the mind. And you're playing dress-up. Yeah, and you're a fucking snob, so... Well, if a snob is someone who pours their soul out onto the ground to be stepped on by zombies or dullards, then yeah, you know, I'm a... I'm a snob. Whatever. Marcus, I just want to act. You want to be famous. Alright, yeah, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go. Okay. Fucking fraud. Who are you, man? Who are you, man? Fuck. Who are you? Fuck! Others have seen what is. And they ask why? No, no, no, no. Others have seen what it is and ask why? I have seen what could be and ask why not? Others have seen what it is and ask why? I have seen what could be and ask why not? Yeah. Others have seen what it is and ask why? I have seen what could be and ask why not? Ah, f... Fuck. Ah, fuck! Oh, fuck. What the fuck? Marcus, baby, talk to me. He can pick up the painting tomorrow. Really? Oh, that's great. I knew if I was a pain in the ass, I;d get my way. Yeah. Yeah. Pick it up tomorrow. Are you okay? You seem kind of out of it. I'm fine. Okay. Well, whew, yeah, I'm just glad we could get this piece out. I have some other pieces I want to talk to you about. I'll give you the weekend before I drive you crazy with that. Let's just say... all last year is suddenly calling me and straight-up kissing my ass. You remember that soap opera actor in NYC I introduced you to. Get a load of this... His mom, the rich one, she wants to meet with you. Yeah, baby. My numero uno. Oh, by the way, I don't think you ever sent me the commission check for that art piece in San Francisco that we did over the bridge. Interior, house, night. Janice and her boyfriend, Steve, run through the living room towards the stairs. They slip and bump into furniture in a mad panic. A lamp falls to the floor. The light bulb shatters, making the room dim to a dark blue. The young couple reach the stairs and look back. They know The Whistler can't be far behind. Steve... "Upstairs!" He grabs Janice's hand and pulls. Janice... "No, he'll find us." Then a crash in the next room. It's him. He's in the house. Steve... "Come on. We have to go now." Interior, hallway, night. The couple runs, looking back with fear. Interior, bedroom, night. Janice and Steve crashes into the bedroom and slam the door behind them. Steve... "Get in the closet." Janice... "What? What about you?" Steve... "Just trust me. I have an idea." A sobbing Janice goes to the closet and shuts the door. Then a loud bash at the bedroom door that shakes the room. He's at the door. Steve drops to the floor and slides under the bed. The door crashes open. The silhouette of The Whistler fills the frame. A slice of moonlight bounces from the blade of his knife. Eddy Park, you are a fucking genius. The Whistler steps into the bedroom. The floor creaks beneath his weight. He takes a few more steps towards the bed, just inches from where Steve is hiding. Two Whistler slowly scans the room and breathes in. Then, as he always does before killed, he leans his head back and whistles those four sinister notes. Though before the last note has a chance to trail off into the night, Steve lunges his arm forward. He's gripping a box cutter. Steve lets out a war cry. Aaah! He slices through The Whistler's Achilles heel. The tendons pop and blood sprays across the floor and across Steve's face. The Whistler grabs at his heel and slips in the pool of blood. He hits the floor with a thud. His knife slides across the room. Steve pulls himself out from under the bed and rushes to the closet. He swings the door open and Janice dives at Steve. They embrace. It's then she sees The Whistler on the floor. She gasps. Janice pushes off Steve and moves across the room. She grabs The Whistler's knife from off the floor. Janice goes cold. She leans her head back and whistles those four notes. In a flash, she plunges the knife deep into The Whistler's chest. He stiffens and expels his last breath. He is dead. And fade to motherfucking black. Well, my friend, you did it again. Ahh. Worthless. Fucking. Trash. What? I said, "Worthless fucking trash." I... I don't understand. Clearly, there's a lot you don't understand, like how to write a decent, fuckin' violent bloodbath. What? First of all, we need to discuss this whistling bullshit. Is that really the best you can do? Whistling? It's... It's just like a-a-a gimmick, you know? Like... Like... Like whistle while you work. This is whistle while you kill. Th-That's gonna be the tag line on the poster. "Whistle while you kill." I hate it. You hate it. I have a few other thoughts. Let's imagine that the boyfriend character... - What's his name? - Steve. Steve. Let's imagine that before Steve makes it under the bed, I get to him first, and I grab him by the back of his stupid Steve boyfriend head like this and smash it as hard as I can against the wall. Or a desk. A desk will work fine. Oh, and the box cutter scene. I have an idea. Please stand. This isn't happening. This can't be happening. Of course it's happening, Ed. It's 100% happening. Now shut the fuck up and hear me out. Now, what if the little Stevie pulls out his box cutter, he swings, but misses, and I go for his wrist. - No. - Yes. And I squeeze it with such force that it... ...breaks. And little Stevie falls to the floor like the sack of shit that he is. Yes. Just like that. I really feel like you're getting the idea. Really opening up to my vision. Oh, that's right. The girl. I almost forgot about the girl. No. Janice. Oh, God, please. Don't hurt me, please. Now, what if, while little Stevie lies there helplessly on the ground, I take out my knife... ...and gut this poor little thing like a fish. - No, please, no, please. - "Please, no. Please, no." Didn't seem to have any problem doing the same to me. Isn't that right, Janice? With my own knife, no less. Fucking disrespectful! We could end there, but I feel like we need a button. Something to bring it all home. This might be a bit much, a little bit too gratuitous, but let's give it a shot. What if I reach deep into her body... ...and pulled out her heart? No. Yeah, you're probably right. Too much. Hey, you know what? This was fun. I feel like we got ourselves a pretty good first draft going here. You agree? Yeah, I hear you. Well, Ed, it's been a blast. Great working with you. And I got to say, I'm already excited to get going on the sequel. Sure it's not, um... Not too late to keep hanging out? It's 8:30. Well, this is it. - Nice neighborhood. - Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty quiet, actually. Oh. - Way cool. - Yeah? It's a lot neater than I thought it'd be. - What? Really? - Yeah. Yeah, I thought you'd be a complete slob from the way you ate your popcorn. - Are you serious? - I'm kidding. Oh. I'm actually a bit of a neat freak. Yeah. I can tell. Hmm. Comfy. Can I get you something to drink? Like a glass of water or something? - Do you have any wine? - Wine? Yeah. You want wine? - Fuck yeah, I do. - Yeah, I got wine. Wine it is. Ivy's an interesting name. Is there a, um... Like a story behind it or... Satan's daughter. What? Really? Do you believe everything that you're told? No, I don't believe everything that I'm told. But I do believe some things. Mmm. Thanks. - Cheers. - Cheers, big ears. What is that? Oh, it's just something stupid I say. It's funny, because when I was a kid, people... you know what, forget it. Never mind. So, what'd you think of the movie? - I thought it was okay. - Yeah. I don't know about the whistling thing. That whistling thing was really scary. - Really? - Uh-huh. I mean, do you really want to give that much warning right when you're about to murder somebody? I mean, whistle a tune? Shouldn't it be like, wham, surprise, and then you all slit their throats or whatever? Wow. You have really thought this through. You have no idea. You are very funny and very cool. I'm having a very good time. And I'm very glad you said yes. - Mm, yeah. - I'm actually surprised you did. I'm pretty much way out of your league, so... You are way out of my league. - Oh, shut up. - You are. - You're... You're funny. - Yes. - And nice. - Mm. Why wouldn't I say yes? Um, because... because you are... are deeply cool and... and beautiful. And I am funny and nice. I'm just me. - You're like an artist? - Mm-hmm. That's so cool. What does that mean? Does that mean you paint or you... What do you do? Uh, no, mostly sculpting. - Sculpting? - Mm-hmm. Oh, like with clay? No, not exactly. Well, yes, sometimes I do. So you're like Demi Moore in the movie "Ghost," right? I love that movie. Uh, I'm pretty sure that was pottery. - Oh. That's different? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. - Yeah, I'm... I think that's as, uh, different as it gets. - Oh. - Yeah. Well, I would... I would love to see your work sometime. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Well, I have some pictures if you want to see them. Yes, yes. Bring them out right now. It's right... Oh, there they are. - These Polaroids? - Yeah. I shoot all my work on Polaroids. I like the way it looks. It's like, uh, capturing a dream from a different time. You know? I'm sorry. I wasn't expecting that. Yeah, it's not for everybody. No, it's... I get it. It's just, um... - Can I ask you a question? - Mm-hmm. What is this? - A man's head. - Yeah. Where's the body? I don't know. Does it matter? I'm... I'm sorry. They're just very realistic. Anyway, that is what I do. No, no, no. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. I don't... Look, I don't know anything about art. About, like, visual art and stuff. Painting, I don't know. I'm not an expert. Music I know. Music I love. When I was a kid, I wanted to be a rock star when I grew up. Can you believe that? I really did. I thought that was gonna be... You're mad. You're mad at me. You're offended. I can tell. - I feel like I've offended you. - No, no, no. I can't get back. There's nothing I can do. I'm completely 100% not offended. - Really? - Yeah. Really. Okay. You know, the thing about art is that it is really simple. It's not about what you see. It's about what you feel. Don't want to leave a stain. I believe that art is in everything and everyone. It's just that not everything and everyone is being used properly to transmit its power. I... I have no idea what you're talking about. Okay. For instance, this table. - Mm-hmm. - Give me your hand. You see it as a table because you treat it that way. And you are afraid of this wine stain, but maybe this wine stain is exactly... what this table needs to express a feeling and in turn transform this meaningless object into art. So I should... I should just spill wine all over the table, because that's the thing? I mean, I just... It's expensive, so I didn't want to ruin it. It's not about the table. It's about how you feel. Okay. Come on. Come here. - Yeah? - I'll show you. Okay. Now look at me. You tell me what you feel. I feel like you are pretty. Interesting. Smart. Funny. I don't... I feel like I'm doing this wrong. Okay. Hang on. Um... Now tell me how you feel. What are you doing? Tell me how you feel. I feel like I don't like it. I feel nervous and scared. Can... I'm anxious. I don't like it. C-Can you stop, please? Can you put the knife down, please? Can you put the knife down? Don't do that. Can you please stop, please? Please. See? I just transformed into art. I went from a girl to a feeling. And you instantly had a visceral, emotional response to me. That is what good art does. I guess. And I could transform you if you let me. What was that? Relax. I was just trying to make a point. I wasn't gonna cut open my throat on your kitchen floor. I know that. It just... I-I got, um... I got a little freaked out. I got little scared. Oh, no. I don't want you to be scared. I want you to be the best that you can be. I see great things in you. You could be a rock star. My rock star. And you could be art. If you let me help you. Really? Yeah. Really. Oh. Ah, I should go. No, no, no, no. I'm sorry. I didn't... - No, no, it's fine. - No, I thought... I mean, come on. We were, weren't we? - I'm not crazy. - No, we... we... we were. We are. It's just it's getting late. Hey. Is it okay if I call you? I'd be pretty pissed if you didn't. Fuck it. Wow. You're back. Yeah. Rock star. - This is all your fault. - What? How is this my fault? You were his babysitter. Oh, I was a great babysitter. And that was like 15 years ago. Well, apparently, he has a great memory. You know, come to think of it, he was a really bright kid. - Waaaah! - Oh, fuck. Oh. Oh, no. We've got to make a run for it. No, wait, you've got to stay here. - He's close. He'll see us. - You can stay here all you want, - but I'm gonna get the fuck out. - No! Waaah! Waaah! Waaaaah! I just want popcorn. Please! Please! Somebody help me! Oh, please! There's a man-sized baby thing out here and he's trying to kill me! Please let me in! This might be the greatest movie ever created. Are you serious? It's so stupid. Somebody help me! Waaah! No, Big Baby, no! Waaah! No, please, Big Baby! No! No, no, no. Please don't. Please. No, no! Who's the big baby now? Okay, so he was so angry about being left in his crib while his babysitter had sex with her boyfriend that, like, 20 years later, he goes on a killing spree? Yeah. Childhood trauma runs deep. How would he even remember that? I don't know. Just... I really felt his pain. When he cried out like that, it was just... Oh, it hit a nerve with me. - Holy shit. - What? - Holy shit. - What? Hold on. No, you can't say "holy shit" like that twice and the follow up with a "hold on." What is it? I got in. To that acting class. That Robert Anderson Wright acting class. - I fucking got in. - Oh, my God! Holy shit! - Yeah, holy shit! - Oh, congrats! Oh, that's amazing. Oh! Oh, my God. This is, like, so fucking cool. Yeah. You deserve it. I don't know. I mean, maybe I shouldn't do it. What do you mean? What if I'm terrible? You're not terrible. You're great. Remember that Burger Barn commercial you did? - Yeah, I was 12. - Yes, 12, but it was a masterful performance. I believed it. I'm kidding. You're great. And you shouldn't get into your head. I should call Marcus. That's gonna be a real confidence booster. Why do you hate him so much? Uh, I don't know, it's... He's a dick. Okay. He's not a dick. He's just... He's sensitive, okay? And he has trouble communicating in a normal way with, like, normal people. Yeah. That really explains it. Besides, you know what? I'm good for him. I keep him grounded. His ex, Ivy, remember I told you about her? She was a total psycho. Like, spent time in prison total psycho. He needs me. Do what you got to do. I'm gonna get more popcorn. - Get me some. - No. What? Wow. As always, could you sound a little more excited? I'm having a difficult night. Okay. Well, I just wanted to tell you I got into that acting class. Cool. Yeah. It's tomorrow. He only accepts, like, a handful of people, so it's actually a pretty big deal. Why are you wasting your time with that shit? It's not art. It's pretend, really, I mean, you know. I'm over here struggling to sketch the flow that's already intact within the mind, and you're playing dress up. Yeah, and you're a fucking snob, so... Well, if a snob is someone who pours their soul out onto the ground to be stepped on by zombies or dullards, then yeah, I'm a snob. Whatever, Marcus. I just want to act. You want to be famous. Alright. Yeah, I'm... I'm gonna go. Okay. That's your man. What? And that's your man. Hey. Let's go and celebrate. I can't. I have band practice. No. But when I get back, we can. And I'll get you ready to act the shit out of that acting class tomorrow. Promise? Promise. Whoo! Goddamn fucking music, right? I mean, have you ever really examined music? I mean, fucking really examined it, like it's true power? Here we go. No, no, no, no, no. It's cool. It's cool if you guys refuse to go deep like I do. I just happen to choose to think about shit like how music is the soundtrack between good and evil, and how good and evil are, like, inextricably linked in a metaphysical battle. I'm sorry, but did you not finish high school? No. No, I didn't finish high school. I would expect someone like you to judge me on whether or not I completed some antiquated educational system that teaches kids more lies than truth. - Preach. - Let me ask you this. What's the happiest chord? Oh, don't ask me. I play bass. - D fucking Major. - Says who? It doesn't matter who says, but you can't deny that certain chords or chord progressions can make you feel happy or sad or mad. Correct? Yeah, well, isn't that the whole point of music? Yeah, dude. That really isn't all that deep. I'll get deep. I'm just dipping my toe in right now so you won't fucking drown. How did I end up in a band with you? I fucking love you guys. Yes, yes, it's a given that music can produce emotions. Everyone knows that. But have you ever really thought about the magical mechanics of that process? Dude, we should call the band - Magical Mechanics. - I love that. I arrange my flesh and bones in a certain pattern and press them against steel strings, and these strings have been tightened or loosened to such a degree that it creates a blending of sound that somehow, over thousands of years, we as humans have decided made sense. And then that sound travels through an electric cord, through a wooden box, and then out a man made speaker. And then the sound travels through the air and into your ear, vibrating a piece of fucking cartilage, sending signals instantaneously through millions, no, billions of neurons where... where nerve cells connect to synapses and then stimulates a fucking emotion. An emotion, you guys. I cry every time I hear "Nothing Compares to You." She cries every time she hears "Nothing Compares to You." Okay. You still haven't said anything I didn't already know. Okay, class. What if I told you that stimulating an emotion was just the beginning, the most rudimentary of functions? You guys ever heard about the brown note? Supposedly it makes you shit your pants. I'm serious. The military discovered it or something. What if I told you that the power of music in sound is limitless and I've figured out how to harness it? Then why aren't we famous yet? I'm not talking about writing a three-minute pop song. I'm talking about note combinations that can transform consciousness, notes that can infiltrate the psyche of a sane human being and unravel them into madness. Dude, how fucking high are you? Wait, how did you figure all this out? Okay, well, I-I haven't figured it out completely, but I have figured out how to exactly... There it is. I call bullshit. I have figured out a sequence of six notes that if played it correctly will manifest evil. I think Black Sabbath figured that out like 50 years ago. That's funny. Alright. I got to get out of here, guys. I'm fucking beat. I'm with you. It's been interesting, as always, bro. Mm. Lightning. So what are the six notes? It's not that easy. I mean, it's complicated. You have to be... They have to be played in a particular way. Like I said, bullshit. Come on. Just tell me what the notes are. Please. Please. Anybody home? Brody. - Hey. - Jesus. What the fuck are you doing sitting in the dark? Nothing. I was, um... I was just sitting. What's wrong? I, um, haven't been able to get a hold of Marcus. He's not answering his phone all night. Surprise, surprise. Okay, look. What if something's wrong? What if he's hurt or something? What if he's just being a petty little bitch? Hey, don't let him do this to you, okay? He's just trying to fuck with your head because you have something important going on tomorrow that, God forbid, doesn't revolve around him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right. Yeah. Hey. I'm still down to celebrate. Actually, I think I'm just gonna go to bed. Okay. Suit yourself. But just a heads up, I will drink all the beer and eat all the Froot Loops. You always do. Like, every night. - Mm. Mm? - No. - Mm. Mm? Mm? - No. - Good night. - Night. Stupid. Brody? Jesus, Brody. Are you okay? I'm fine. Why? I don't know. I thought I heard a noise. Are you sure you're okay? Are you okay? Yeah. Maybe you were just dreaming or something. I wasn't dreaming. I wasn't doing anything. Okay. Well... Sorry to bug you. Hey. You know, I don't think we'll be seeing Marcus anymore. No? No. Why do you say that? I think something bad happened to him. What are you talking about? Hope, do you know who Gabrielle Berlatier was? She worked in a whorehouse in southern France as a maid. She was working there to earn money to pay off her medical bills after being savagely attacked by a rabid dog. O... kay. She was also the reason Vincent Van Gogh chopped off his own ear. Why are you telling me this? He thought if he offered her his own flesh, it would help her heal. That's crazy. Is it? Tomorrow, at the acting class, I really feel like I'm gonna shine. Do something special. Yeah. That's... That's great. Yeah. I prepared a monologue. Do you want to hear it? Well, I mean... Yeah. O-Okay. Sure. "The Debt," Ryan Knightley. At the foot of my bed, reaching, but just out of reach, my flesh covers bone shadowing the breaks and cracks. But not the scars that rest on top. Left behind by otherworldly creatures masquerading as civilized men. Death needs more yet, but needs me more. I am an allegoria of nothing. A reflection that refuses to look back. A human vampire with endless time that's about to run out. Okay. Well... Good night. Good night. - This is all your fault. - What? How is this my fault? You were his babysitter. Oh, I was a great babysitter. And that was like 15 years ago. Well, apparently, he has a great memory. You know, come to think of it, he was a really bright kid. - Waaaah! - Oh, fuck. Oh. Oh, no. We've got to make a run for it. No, wait, you've got to stay here. - He's close. He'll see us. - You can stay here all you want, - but I'm gonna get the fuck out. - No! Waaah! Waaah! - Waaaah! - Oh, shit. Oh, no. Waaaaah! Please! Please! Somebody help me! Oh, please! There's a man-sized baby thing out here and he's trying to kill me! Please let me in! No. No, no. Waah! Waaah! No! No, Big Baby, no! - Waaah! - No, please, Big Baby! No! No, no, no. Please don't. Please. No, no! Who's the big baby now? Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
