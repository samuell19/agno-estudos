Subtitles by explosiveskull Excuse me, can we pull over please? Can we stop the car please? - Thank you very much. - Bye. [Man] Ciao bella! Wow. How are you? Where are you from? Sorry, where are you from? - Please. Please. - Argentina. [Man] Argentina, wow, it's so beautiful, like you. [laughs] Don't worry. What's your name? Sorry sir, I'm just... Please, please, just a name. - Emma. - Oh, Emma. One moment please. I have a poem for you, okay? Okay. [speaks Arabic] That's a brilliant poem. - Beautiful. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Sorry, sir, I'm just... - I'm kind of in a rush, so... - Okay, I help you. No. no. - Upstairs? - No, no, no. I'm okay, but thank you for your help. [speaks aggressively in Italian and Arabic] - Jesus. - [yelling] I don't know what you're saying! 20 you give me. I help you. - 20? For what? - For help you! [shouting in Arabic] - Okay, okay. - 20 euros. Jesus Christ. Okay, okay. [breathing heavily] Oh shit. Hello? Benedetta? Hi, it's Emma Morgan. Yeah, I'm actually in Italy. Yeah, there are some things I needed to do so it all worked out perfect timing. Okay so the day after tomorrow. What time? Ten? Okay, cool. Last time we spoke you said that you think that... sorry... that they're close to buying? Perfect. Emma. Ginevra. So strange to see you I was just in the neighborhood. You look exactly like your mother. Come on, let's have a cup of tea. I remember you were such a good student. Do you still play? No. I hardly remember anything anymore. Don't you miss New York? No, I love it here. I've never been happier. You don't have to lie to me. Everywhere I go it's the same feeling. I get caught in this loop, I can't... I can't describe it. I got fired from my job in New York. Just came here without having a second thought and now I find myself here and... I just sort of drift from place to place without feeling anything. Does it get better? I need to get this repaired. Please could I have another glass of wine? Hello? Hello? Please, sit down. I only stopped by to pick something up. Tancredi. I thought you'd be hungry. Emma. I was just about to leave. Can I take you for a glass of wine? Where do you live? Thanks. Here. Thank you, I owe you a drink. You can get a lot around here for 20 euros. They give me such a dark vibe. What's that? Oh, it's funny, it's a joke. Guys, welcome! Nice to meet you. Hey. Nice to meet you, too. Emma. You want a mussel? Do you know that we also call... whatever, I'm not going to go into details. [laughs] No but normally we call ugly girls mussels. [Emma] Why? First of all because they're ugly if you open them. And second because mussels, they stick on the rock, and normally ugly girls, they stick on you after you have sex with them. But... Do you want more pasta? Is this enough? Come here. Lollo, which third world country were you... I forgot to serve myself! Isn't this place just amazing? You don't have any idea. In years past you could hardly get a table here... I have a piece of fish in my... So thank God for the recession we can buy everything because everything is so cheap. That's the best part. I'm gonna choke. Lollo too if he does it in the proper way! Here you go. I am. Thank you, God. Come on. Piece of shit money. I have coins, I have coins. Lapo, I have coins. Well thank you. [Emma] Is it even Sunday? Who gives a shit! I don't have any idea guys. I don't fucking give a shit. Come on Lapo let's go. Let's go! I'm not going anywhere until I have my vodka tonic. I'm fine, I'm fine. You have a brother? Yeah. He's great. He's a liability. This is much better. Too many people at the umbrella. We can have a relaxed aperitivo here. Speak in English Tancredi. He's so rude. It's okay. I understand a bit of Italian. How? She used to live in Florence. That doesn't mean anything. Anyway, we speak like peasants. Out of Tuscany nobody understands us. [chuckles] Nobody understands you. Lapo thinks he's going to be a diplomat and that's why when he drinks he speaks like an Albanian with a Milanese accent. Tancredi had an existential crisis when he was a teenager and that's why he ran away to a boarding school for eight years. You want to be a diplomat? What do you do Emma? You don't even know what she does? - Consulting. - Cool. No, not really. I just quit my job. Oh, so you're just here traveling and... I don't know. Right now I don't seem to be doing much of anything. That's perfect. In Italy no one ever does anything. Do you have an extra? No. Can I sit? I ran away too, you know. Six years. What makes you think I ran away? You might find when you go back that little has changed. I'd have no way of knowing. I love this dress. It was my mother's. What do you know about Poggio Imperiale? That's where the rich kids go when they can't pass their exams. They're hiring an English teacher. This close to the school year? I'm good with books. And I could use a source of income. You can move in with me. It's important that I keep the house. What I'm saying is you don't need to. Darling can you put the roast back in the oven please? - Have you turned it already? - Yeah. Are you okay? What's that? I don't know! What are you doing? It's gauze. I'm sure that Emma will be happy to help you out. Of course. Yes. [Emma] [sniggers] Would anybody like dessert? [Father] Yes please. - Let me help you. - Oh no, leave it. Boring. By the way, Emma. Tancredi fancies himself too much of an intellectual to make you drop your decision. I studied comparative literature at Dartmouth with an emphasis in literary theory. I worked in consulting but I didn't find the work stimulating. I do, however, have experience teaching English in South America on one of my leave terms. That villa belonged to one of the oldest families in Florence. The problem with the old families is that no one works. Ten years ago the man who owned that villa realized he had to sell it. But he waited too long so he sold it as is with everything inside for around twenty million euros. And the man who bought it, some German investor, he sold half the furniture inside for guess how much? Ten? More than twenty million. What kind of an idiot could let something like that happen? My father. I'm sorry. - This is my cousin. - Hello, nice to meet you. - Ciao. Emma. - Francesco. [Tancredi] Fuck's sake. What's strappona? Strappona is quite a rude word for these girls. It's quite a national thing hunting them. - Cheers. - Cheers. [Emma] Does anyone have a cigarette? [All 3] Yeah, sure, of course. Thank you. - Happy birthday! - Thank you very much. I see you brought anorexic Jesus with you. How are you doing, man? How are you doing? Thank you. And here he is. Do you mind asking my mom if she needs any help with lunch? Good morning. Ciao Emma. Did you sleep well? Perfectly well, thank you. It's a beautiful day. Is there anything I can help you with? No thank you. Are you sure? I won't have much time for the beach anyway. Really? In that case I need some basil. You know where it is in the garden. And milk. Hello? Fra? - Ciao Fra. - Ciao Emma. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Good. Thank you. No beach for you this morning? No. We ran out of milk. Did you walk from Suvericcio? Just in case - you know, there are wild boars. My mom saw one this morning. Where? Here. Just right down in the woods. Pretty dangerous this time of the year. Did you go for a ride this morning? Yeah, big one. Castiglioncello and back. That must be like a hundred kilometers or something. You know, this show won't last forever. Let me get that milk for you. Cigarettes? Emma, you have any cigarettes? Thank you. - You want one? - Yes please. No, no grazie. Can I use your card? - You need to buy a pack? - Yeah. Alright, let's go together, I need to buy another one. What the fuck? I know, it's horrible. Lapo makes them race sometimes. - Ciao. - Hello. - Hello. - Hey there. - Hi. - Hello! - Luisa. Nice to meet you. - Luisa, my sister, sorry. Sorry. [whispers] Can I have some? How could I say no, right? Finally. How long are you staying Lulu? [Luisa] Just for four days unluckily. Just the time to relax, and then... [Luisa] And then back. Back to work. Oh, thanks. Well what would you propose as an alternative? [Lapo] There is no alternative. So, forgo search and rescue? Oh, we rescue them, then the others get hope. That's warped logic. It means I can touch the food at the top of my stomach. It's funny. That's horrible. - Come on, that's so funny. - No, it's not funny. You lament that your country is crumbling, how you're being left behind how your generation has been plunged into recession but here we pretend that it's all a myth. It's been sanctioned. You pretend that it's genteel and charming, well it's not! Sorry Lapo. This is Italy's prodigal son. No better than the rest of them. A lost prophet sitting on his hands. [Tancredi] Emma, you're, you're wonderful. I really want to thank you for helping my mother. For everything. It's no problem. Now that all this bullshit with Lapo is over we can do whatever we want. We can go to Paris. To London. Run away from all this. Subtitles by explosiveskull
