(AUDIENCE MURMURING) HIDE IT GOOD, NOW, CAPTAIN. SHANE: BEING A FIREHOUSE MASCOT ISN'T ALL JUST FOR SHOW. IT'S A REAL JOB THAT REQUIRES REAL SKILLS. SEARCH AND RESCUE REQUIRES SOMETHING MORE. ALL RIGHT, DEWEY... FIND IT. GO AHEAD. DEWEY'S SENSE OF SMELL IS 10,000 TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN A HUMAN'S. THAT, COMBINED WITH THE ABILITY FOR HIM TO THINK ON HIS PAWS, MAKES HIM AN INVALUABLE SEARCH AND RESCUE DOG. HE CAN REMEMBER A SCENT FOR WEEKS, EVEN MONTHS, AND RECOGNIZE IT FROM A GREAT DISTANCE. (SNIFFING) (WHINES) IT REALLY IS YOU. (BARKING) OH, I MISSED YOU, TOO. I MISSED YOU SO MUCH. I DON'T KNOW HOW, AND I DON'T CARE, BUT YOU FOUND MY DOG.

DUDES, COME ON, THAT'S A REXXX CLASSIC. HIS NAME'S NOT EVEN REXXX; IT'S DEWEY. IT SAYS SO ON HIS TAG. NO, SEE, THAT WAS THE PROP TAG HE WAS WEARING WHEN HE GOT LOST. OUR DOG IS NOT A MOVIE STAR, HE'S NOT A CELEBRITY. HE'S A... HE'S A MUTT. I MEAN, WE-WE PRACTICALLY FOUND HIM ON THE STREET. YEAH, WELL, SEE... HE LOOKS DIFFERENT IN THESE PRODUCTION STILLS BECAUSE HIS TRADEMARK HAIRDO IS, UH... IT'S A HAIRPIECE. THAT'S MY BOY. I MEAN, COME ON, YOU MUST'VE NOTICED HOW SPECIAL HE WAS. UH, LOOK, MR. FALCON, I MEAN, I CAN APPRECIATE WHAT YOU MUST HAVE GONE THROUGH, BUT THIS, UH... THIS DOG MEANS A LOT TO OUR ENGINE COMPANY, A LOT TO THE CITY... AND PARTICULARLY TO MY SON. NOW, IF THERE'S ANY WAY THAT WE CAN COMPENSATE YOU, UH... IF YOU'RE ASKING ME TO PUT A PRICE ON FAMILY... I CAN'T. IT'S TIME FOR REXXX TO COME HOME. YOU CAN'T TAKE HIM AWAY. (SIGHS) WELL, SHANE... DAD, DO SOMETHING. SHANE... IT'S HIS DOG. I KNOW THIS DOESN'T MEAN MUCH TO YOU RIGHT NOW, BUT... THANKS FOR TAKING CARE OF HIM. WELL, YOU GOT IT WRONG. HE WAS THE ONE TAKING CARE OF US. (WHINES) GET OUT OF HERE, THEN. JUST GO. (WHINES) TAKE HIM. I'M SORRY. HE WAS A PAIN IN THE BUTT, ANYWAY. (WHINES) WELL, I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING WISE AND FATHERLY, BUT THE TRUTH IS, THIS JUST SUCKS. CAP, WE GOT AN EMS CALL. (SIGHS) (HORNS HONKING) JOE: FIRE DEPARTMENT! MAN: HEY! COME ON, LET'S GO.

I REALIZE THAT, BUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO. WHAT IS THE HOLDUP? MORE ACTIVITY IN THAT AREA RIGHT NOW IS SURE TO DRAW ATTENTION. AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT CONNOR FAHEY. I HAVE FINALLY PUT A CITY COUNCIL IN PLACE THAT WILL APPROVE A SPORTS COMPLEX. I WANT THAT FINAL PROPERTY IN ASHES. DO IT TONIGHT. TONIGHT?! HOW AM I GONNA DO THAT? (CHUCKLES) YOU'RE A FIREMAN. FIGURE IT OUT. LIGHT A MATCH! (DOOR OPENS) (MUTTERS): SON OF A... GOD! SELLARS: NO! (SHANE GASPS) DON'T YOU TELL ME I'M IMPATIENT. I HAVE WAITED LONG ENOUGH. NO MORE EXCUSES. CALL ME WHEN IT'S DONE. (GASPS) DAD WAS RIGHT. AH, WELCOME TO THE NEU HOTEL. PLEASE, COME, COME, COME. AND IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO... ASK. TRASH.
