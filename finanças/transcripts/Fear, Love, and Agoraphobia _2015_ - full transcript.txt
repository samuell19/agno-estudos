Critics of genetically modified crops say they're a possible threat to health and the environment. - [Radio Announcer] You may not wanna hear about it.

This is a national problem. - [Radio Announcer] An inspiring fever is not very difficult in the United States. It's a long history of trying to-- - [Jessica] Coming up: the Sacramento State student who's graduating this week. He was diagnosed with advanced brain cancer four years ago-- - [Radio Announcer] Among the chemicals we're exposed to daily are those that made plastics pliable. - [Jessica] In Iraq and Afghanistan for many reentry into civilian life can be challenging. - [Radio Announcer] Technology's gonna allow us-- (eerie music) - Just get in the bank and just do it. Just do what you gotta do. Just get in the frickin' bank and just do it. (eerie music) Quit being such a baby, man!

Chet, I thought that was you, man. - Hey hey, what's up Scott? - Hey what's with the mask, man? - Oh, you know just... It's a bad air quality day. - Man, it's been a long time no? Like since high school, huh? - Mmm, yeah. - Is the mask for the arachnephobia thing? - No no, it's (chuckles)... It's agoraphobia, actually. Hey, but I really gotta get going. - Okay yeah, yeah. - Yeah. Good seeing you though. (grunts) - Remember when you graduated, we graduated man and you were freakin' out? My aunt thought you were a special needs student. Do you remember that? (laughs) Oh, man. - Oh hey, you know a pack of cigarettes shortens your life span by 3 1/2 hours, right? - Yeah no, I'm cuttin' back man. I'm cuttin' back. - Really, that's 7,000 chemical compounds being created by just burning the thing. It's really poison Scott, seriously. - Alright. Do you still live with your mom? Is she okay? - Yeah. Don't litter that cigarette, please. - Alright. Friendly, friendly. - Alright. (soft music) - Hello? Hey, what are you doin'? Yeah, guess who shut... Oh shit, hold on a second. Hey, excuse me. Excuse me, do you have any spare change? Bitch. - Hey excuse me, do you have any spare change? Do you have any spare change? Do you know what the best nation in the world is? - What? - Dough-nation. (coins rattling) - Do you think this is a game? Huh? (girl spitting) (coins rattling) - (screams) What the... Give that back! Hey! - Fetch. - What the fuck is wrong with you? - Really? - Yeah. Bitch. Goddammit, fuckin' bitch! (horns honking) (birds chirping) (suspenseful music) - [Tracey] Tell me about your day. What was big? - [Chet] Scott was there and he was really, really annoying. It was a whole cluster. - [Tracey] Wow. You went to the bank by yourself? How was it being outside? - I thought my head was gonna explode. - Chet, I think this could be really good for you. (baby crying) (sighs) Sorry. Send me a text later? - Okay Trace, kiss the baby for me. - Yeah, I will. Okay, bye. (horn blaring) - Ugh! Ugh! - We got sideswiped! They missed us by this much. - It's insane. - Yeah the horn is stuck. The (mumbles) was amazing That was just crazy. - Mom, what happened with the bank? Why didn't you guys call? I was waiting all day for you. - You went to the bank? That's wonderful Chet, that's wonderful. Oh I'm sorry, I thought it was tomorrow. Salt Lake's nice, I think you'll like it. - Hey, y'all packed? It's a big day tomorrow. - No, no! I can't think. Why didn't you guys call? I was waiting all day for you? - Wait a minute, you're not packed? You have to have your clothes together, honey. The cleaning crew was coming tomorrow. We gotta be outta here, sweetie. I mean the renter's coming in a month. - I can't go with you guys to Utah. I can't. - Wait a minute, I told you months ago. You said yes, you agreed. - I know, I... I need more time. It's a big move, can you please just give me three... Three more weeks please? - No, I cannot do that. I have less than a day, Chet. You know what I'm gonna do? You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna return the renter's check and you can make it here on your own. But you're gonna have to pay rent. - No! - This is gonna be good yes. This is gonna be good for you. This will be good for you. - You okay, Chet? You want some water or something? - What about me? Who's gonna go to the supermarket? What if Meow Meows has to go to the vet? - You'll figure it out. - [Pat] You've got your disability money. You're doing some editing. - That's not the problem. Mom, can we... Mom. Mom! Mom, can we please talk about this! - We're gonna take the Hybrid. You can have the SUV, okay. That's it, simple. Right, where are my glasses? Have you seen my glasses? - Here you go, buddy. - Honey, just give us a minute. It's (mumbles) getting dramatic. Listen to me. Listen to me, come on. Come up here. (Chet groaning) Sweetie, look at me. Look into my eyes. I am nearly 60 years old and I have been trapped here in this house with you for the last 10 years. We need to grow, the both of us. - Do you even know what I went through today? Do you want me to die. I have to stay inside; I don't have a choice, mom. Please. - The first 30 days are gonna be the hardest. You can do it. (foreboding music) - I should have known you'd pick your new husband over your son. I'm so stupid! So stupid. - You know that is not true! You know what you need to breathe. Do you wanna meditate? Because we can meditate right now. - No! - You need to meditate. - Please don't. - You know, I can't always be the wall that protects you. You gotta learn how to protect yourself! (soft music) - There you go. - Francis. - Maggie. - Ten letter word for professional liar. - Who are the top three liars? - Who are crack dealers, car salesmen, and the president. - Aha, there you go. Try politician. Hey, I need my van back. Sharon is on my ass about that van. Stop shampooing your hair in the damn ladies' room. It's clogging up the drain. - What's this? - This is milk thistle. It's for detoxing your foul liver. - Whiskey for fucking me up. - No! Your boyfriend, Dr Oz, swears by that stuff. Take it. - What does he say about your gunt? - Gunt, what's that? - Excuse me? - Nothing now-- - G-U-N-T, gunt! - Nothing, it's nothing. - Eat it! - Lighten up, Francis. (siren blaring) (soft, somber music) (prison door lock buzzing) - Sorry it's been so long, hon. - 90 days. - Where's your wedding ring? - I had to pawn it. It's just a ring, babe. (sighs) It's good to finally see you, hon. Are you taking your inositol? - What's the point? It doesn't work. No, screw it. I'm not taking that. - Hey brother. Hey Maggie, how ya doin'? - Hey Rego. (Rego and Rick mumbling) So how ya been, babe? - Really good. I found a new public assistance lawyer that might take your case pro bono. - It's four years now. I'm the one that's supposed to be locked up here, not you. Rego thinks that maybe God put me on this new path. - God didn't put you in here. Two assholes that lied and testified against you did. - No, he saved me. I mean it. I thought about hurtin' myself. I thought about just checkin' out - Have you talked to the prison psych? (Rick laughing) (muffled background crosstalk) - [Ann] My God, this room is so tiny. You should take my room. - I know. I'm not a little kid, mom. - Okay. I found these in the trash. Why aren't you taking your meds? Does this affect your ability to have an erection? - Mom, just don't talk about my penis, okay? - Oh now why not? I used to clean it and you used to pee on me-- - Mom, please stop talking. - When I would change you. Well you did. - I don't like living in a fog, okay. I'm fine, I've got Tracey. - You have neighbors. Reach out to them. - I just want you to be happy. Just go be happy. (Ann chuckling) (Ann singing in foreign language) - Okay. - Oh honey, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. (soft, somber music) (Chet breathing heavily) (water trickling) - [Woman On Radio] They are your loved ones, neighbors, and friends. They've served in Iraq and Afghanistan. For many, re-entry into civilian life can be challenging. - [Man Over Radio] Jayda Roberts, an Army Reservist and case manager, says that returning vets miss their service routines. So Dry Hooch offers vets different ways to cope. - [Jayda] What we come home to is not a very structured environment like we're used to. (birds chirping) (dog barking) - Meow Meows. (cat toy rattling) Meow Meows. Meow Meows (sighs). You better not be outside again. - [Dr Green] Hi Chet, Dr Green here. You missed several sessions now. This new issue you're developing with the breathing outside is really troubling me and I really think we need to address your agoraphobia as well as this new issue. Please call my office. (phone ringing) - Hey, I was just thinking about you. - Hey Tracey. You wanna come over today? Just hang out? You can bring the baby. It's been months. Tracey, you there? - I, I don't know how to say this. I feel really bad, but Roger doesn't want me to come over there anymore. He says it's not safe for the baby. I told him that was silly. - He said that? You kidding me? Roger went to school with me since fourth grade. You guys know me. - He just thinks you're depressed and maybe unbalanced. And I told him you were my first. - You told him? (gurgling water) (lively country music) Room for rent. Cheap rent in exchange for favors. No. no. (keyboard clicking) In exchange for personal assistant services. Room for rent. Cheap rent in exchange for personal assistant services. So this is the room. - Yeah, it doesn't look bad. How much per month is the rent? - Researching is my hobby. (chuckles) Sorry, I'm nervous. - Oh no, you're fine. What kind of research do you do? - The environment. The poisons we put into it that are killing us and all the spraying in the sky and all this stuff. Did you refill that? - Yeah, I recycle. - Do you know how much BPA, fluoride and germs and aluminum that you're drinking right now? (Marcella laughing) - So I get a break on the rent if I go to the grocery store, the post office-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Basically anything that involves going outside. We should start a book club together. I've got a... My room is right on the other side of yours, so anytime you wanna talk, you just knock knock. - Okay. - That's my living room. It's really nice; you're gonna be impressed. We just got a fireplace here and the back door. Personally I think television destroyed the family unit and the ability for people to really connect and develop deep relationships. People need to share, to eat together, talk. - You're gay, right? - Um, no. No, I'm not. - Well just so we're clear, I am in a committed relationship. - Chet! Oh my God, Chet. - Hey. Have we met? - Last time I saw you I was like eight years old with buck teeth. Janice Dmytryk's daughter. My mom was BFF's with your mom, remember? - Valentina? - Yes. (chuckles) - Wow. (chuckles) You grew up really beautiful. - Pretty lucky, huh? - So I saw the post online and I wanted to surprise you. So I used another name. Surprise! (laughs) I love your rock star hair. It's perfect. (chuckles) - Thanks, I didn't even wash it. - Chet and I are practically cousins. Are you here for the room too? - Better watch out for this one. She looks like jail bait. - Let me get you an application. - Oh, awesome. Can I see the room? - Yeah yeah, right this way. - I totally don't mind running errands or anything. I can totally drive you. This one? Oh perfect! I can totally drive you to the mall anytime you like. - [Chet] Well that's actually the last place I'd wanna go. - How are you? - Good. (muffled crosstalk) - (mumbles) Maggie. - Hey sugar tits. Hey, what's with the glass? - Sorry, we're outta stems. - Okay, you need to wash them, okay. Rex knows what kind of glass to use. Did Rex even make this? 'Cause a dry Manhattan is 1 1/2 ounce Canadian whiskey, 3/4 oz dry vermouth and a dash of bitters. No ice. - It;' just like the other seven that you drank. - No, no it's not. 'Cause if you pour all these ingredients over ice, you will not have a Manhattan. You'll have something else. It might be tasty, but it's not a Manhattan. - It has everything to do about race. It's racism. You know what a scalp is? - Yeah, I know what a scalp is. - It's a bloody scalp. That's what it means, man. You guys don't get it. They're disrespecting my skins. What do you mean your skins? What does that mean? - My skins, my brothers. (yells) - Hey hey, Cochise! You wanna keep it down? - (laughs) Hey Marine, you alright? - Fan fucking tastic. Here drink up. - Oh yeah! Oorah! (soft country music) - What's wrong with your mouth? - I don't know. It's either a canker sore or herpes. You want me to go down on you? (Maggie groaning) (Francis laughing) You check out that room for rent? - Yeah, some teenage little skank is gonna get it. Fuck it, I'm fine in the van. - The van? You mean my van? That I need back please, Maggie. I don't like you sleepin' on the parking lot anyway. - If your girlfriend didn't hate me, maybe I could rent from you. (door knocking) - Hey. - How are you? Hey cousin. - Val, I thought I told you I need at least a day to decide. - You would not believe the day that I've had. I just thought we had a real connection you know? Honestly my grandparents are driving me crazy. So is it cool if I stay here for like a night or two? Do you have any asprin? Oh and if you hate me, you can totally kick me out tomorrow. - Um. - Please? - (stammers) Yeah we can I guess do a one night test drive? - Yeah, no problem. I will be the perfect roommate. You'll see. * I wish you'd stay right here - Do you need a place to stay? - Nope. - Really? 'Cause I heard you need a place to stay. Why don't we arm wrestle, huh? You win, you can stay at my place tonight. What'd you say, huh? (Maggie spitting) - (chuckles) I like that. I'm White Eagle. - His name is Hector and he's a Cuban from La Puente. - Half Cuban. The other half is Lakota. - Look, Bald Eagle or whoever you are, I'm not here to get fucked, okay? - Why you so pissed off, huh? 'Cause your husband is in the joint? Yeah, I heard. It must be tough knowin' your old man is takin' it up the ass, huh? (laughs) Aww, did I hurt your feelings, soldier girl? Fuckin' bitch! (Maggie laughing) (muffled crosstalk) You fuckin' bitch! Let me at her. Let me fuckin' (mumbles). (muffled crosstalk) - Back the fuck up! - Throw her outta here. Get off me, man. - (mumbles) fuck! - Throw her out, man. Throw her out. - Alright. Look I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry guys, okay? Look, it was me okay. Okay look, hey, I'm buyin' a round. Okay? I'm gonna buy a round for us, okay. - You cool? - Yeah. (hand smacking) (White Eagle yelling) Bitch! Big lipped bitch! Little bitch, you call yourself an Indian. You motherfucking (mumbles). - Fuckin' bitch. - What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you wanna get hurt? Is that it? - Did you hear what he said? - I don't care, I don't give a fuck. I am done caring, do you understand? - Goddammit, throw her outta here! - Sit down! - Get the fuck outta here. - No, I'm tired of you treating me like shit. I'm just good ol' Fran who's gonna be here for you no matter what? Is that the deal? Well guess what, Maggie. It works both ways. - No Frannie, (stammers) I'm sorry, okay. - Get the fuck outta my bar. - So Valentina, I noticed you wrote down self-employed on your application. - Yeah. Darn, is that a zit? Can you see that? - No I... I don't see anything. Val, do you have a job? - Yeah of course. Of course. I mean if you don't like a little test drive, it's no problem. - Look, why don't you come back tomorrow and we can talk about this with your mom. - You're thinking about what that snooty lady said, aren't you? You can check my ID if you want. Here. Go ahead. (yawns) I am absolutely bushed. I should really get to bed. Living with my grandmother and grandfather, it is absolutely hell. They treat me like I'm Cinderella. When I told them that I found a place, they got so mad. I mean honestly. It's like my granddad makes me clean the house and feed my grandma, change her old lady diaper. It is so gross. No wonder my mom ran away. Anyway, I really do have a good part-time job. I just got started, so your place is perfect. (chuckles) We can do it in the butt if you'd like. I just wanna stay a virgin until I get married. What, we're not really cousins. - I'm gonna go to bed. Have a good night. - Sweet dreams, Chet. - Yeah, goodnight. (ominous music) - Oh this is it. Look, all the fuckin' tape. Fucking black fucking curtains and shit. Gimme that fuckin' shit. (mumbles) bitch. Here bitch. - Shit, get me in. Hello. - Who's there? (muffled crosstalk) (Sam and White Eagle laughing) - Fuckin' get in here. - Showtime. - Get the fuck outta here. I got a gun. - Hey. I'm gonna get you. - I'm not fuckin' around. You don't wanna test me. - Oh I don't wanna test you? I don't wanna test you? You don't wanna fucking test White Eagle! (grunts) Get me in there! (car rattling) - [Sam] Hey, baby. - [White Eagle] You think you're fuckin' tough, huh? (mumbles) something tough now, huh? Why don't ya come out here? Come out here now, huh? Come out here! Let me in! Oorah, oohrah. Come on, soldier girl. (grunts) Don't fuckin' test me. (car door banging loudly) - [Sam] Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. (car tires screeching) (sinister music) (birds chirping) - I hope I didn't wake you. I don't mean to be pushy, but I was just wondering if you found someone yet. - Actually, I'm kinda still figuring things out. Kinda doin' a trial period. - No we're not. - Val, I told you. - Why did you let me stay the night? That makes no sense. Were you high? Now you're trying to kick me out? - No, no, I... Okay, fine. - [Valentina] Do you have any Fruit Loops? - [Chet] No. - It's nice seeing you again. Aren't you going to leave? - No, I don't think so. (soft guitar music) - Chet! Chet! - Okay. This is part of your duties. These are my fingernails and toenails. - What does that have to do with your disease? - I don't know. I get nervous. I save them. My mom had to sneak out the last jar I filled when I was asleep. So go ahead. Take care of these when I'm asleep. That's part of the job. - I am not leaving and I am not touching your gross nails. - You'd better not piss this guy off. He might chop you up. - You're both disgusting. - I'm sorry. I hope it didn't freak you out. - Oh no, no, no. What do you think? We gonna do this? - You sure you wanna live with an agoraphobic environmentally obsessive weirdo? - I'm in. Thanks. Hey, um, do you mind if I put my van in your garage? I'm having engine trouble. - Sure, no problem. - Do you want me to take this to the dumpster for you? - No, no, no. I got it. - They say that dog is man's best friend, but in this story it turns out that a cat earned that title. Jessica Gomez of Pasadena was unloading groceries from the family car when she was attacked by a pit bull. Apparently Ralphie the family dog and Chewy the family cat were also in the front yard-- - You must be a local news junkie, huh? Four, five, six and 11 o'clock news. - Yeah, I just like to stay current. - There's a really great website I like for news. It's the only truthful reporting around. I'll give you the web address. Oh, do you think you could gimme... This is the shopping list and some cash. Do you think you could go in a day or two? - Sure, not a problem. (muffled TV conversation) - So you're a Marine? - Yeah, I was a Marine. - Oh. - Has anyone ever told you you look like that actor? The guy in the movie Mask. - (chuckles) You think I look like Jim Carrey? - No no no, that's The Mask. Mask was the one with Cher. She plays a biker chick and she has a teenage son. He's got hair like yours and a fucked up face. He's deformed. Sorry, I mean you look like him like if he wasn't deformed. - Yeah, yeah, no... (Chet mumbling) Yeah you look like no one deformed or otherwise too. - [News Reporter] This is Lauren Casey reporting to you live from Pasadena for Action 3 News. (dog barking) - Thanks for goin' to the store. - Receipt's in the bag. Hope you don't mind me using your stuff. - No, no problem. - I like the way you've got your kitchen organized. - My mom was a head nurse. Very organized. I'm gonna make some turkey chili tomorrow. You can have some if you like. I mean if you wanted to have dinner with me or on your own, either way. - Sure, we can have dinner. Hey, I hate to ask but do you mind if I borrow your SUV tomorrow? It's my uncle's birthday. He's in a rest home and it's a three hour drive. I'll bring it back with a full tank. - Sure, no problem. - Cool, thanks. - No no no no no, stop. Next time you go to the store could you try and not get anything in a plastic container? - Sure, why? - Ever hear of BPA? - No, like HPV? - No no, see this jar? Bisphenol A. Most of the items at your supermarket are in containers that contain BPA. Basically anything that stores food and beverages. It has estrogen mimickers and is linked to cancer, diabetes, obesity. - Hope I don't get tit cancer. - I don't think you should come see me any more. I want a divorce. It's not fair to you. Hey, I'm not getting outta here. I'm not the same. - Yes, you are. You're my man. Nothing will change that. - Maggie, I almost let a guy go down on me after I got released from solitary. - Okay? - Listen, I went a little crazy in there. It's like being buried alive 23 hours a day. When they released me back into the gen pop, I couldn't even talk. (ominous music) One night, my cell mate this jerk Dallas he thinks I'm asleep. He gets up in the middle of the night and I know what he wants 'cause he's had the hots for me ever since I got in here. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I wanna hear it. - I pretend I'm asleep. He put his hand down my skivvies and started playing with my dick a little. I pretended it was you and me in bed together. I started to get hard, then I realized what I was doin'. I jumped up and I growled somethin' at him. I scared him shitless. He goes back to his bed and I just laid there in the dark trying not to cry. I'm disgusting. You think so too, Maggie. You think I'm disgusting too, don't you? You do. - I understand it's hard okay? I don't care if you need to get licked, sucked or fucked in here to stay alive. You're gonna stay... Wait! You need to stay strong. - You need to remain seated. - He's a decorated war vet. - Remain seated! (Rick laughing) - You still got it. You'd break me outta here, if you could wouldn't you? - I'll break your neck if you ever talk like that again. (soft guitar music) - [Chet] And then all of a sudden she runs off with Pat and she won't even talk to me now. Are you sure you're okay? - Hmm? It's just... It's my uncle. It was hard seein' him. He just looks older and I'm just worried about him. He's changed. - Change can be good. - Yeah, I guess. - Well, it's gotta be rough living in a rest home. It's sorta like prison for old people. I hear it's pretty common for old men to escape and try to go back to their old lives. Maybe you can move him to a better home. - Maybe. - Hey, I was thinkin' if you wanna move into my mom's room. It's the biggest room, you can go ahead and do that. (sniffs) Wait, do you smell that? What is it? It smells like a fart. (Maggie laughing) That's so gross. You gotta see a gastroenterologist. (Maggie farting) Really, come on. Oh that's so gross. That's so gross. (foreboding music) (wall rumbling) - Maggie? (wall knocking) You okay? (vacuum whirring loudly) Hey. - Hey. - Wow, look at you. You look really nice. - I look stupid. It's old. I got a job interview. I just wanna make a good impression. - Great. Hey, good luck. - Yeah, thank you. (SUV revving) (inquisitive music) - So, what happened first? - Okay, well like I said, them two bikers come in and they're yellin' at the clerk. They dragged the little clerk over the counter and that's when Maggie's man yells at them bikers to leave the little clerk alone. - [Jerry] So Rick Mosey was in the store already? - Yup. That's when this big hairy biker came at him with a knife. Six inch, serrated blade. Starts waving that thing around in his face and he says "Fuck off!" First they attacked the clerk and then they attacked her man Rick. I've seen it. - Freeze! Do not move! Don't even think about moving. Boom! - He had to protect hisself, so he did. - So gimme more details. (Mountain Mike sighing heavily) - I had to call for air support. Now, that's the only thing I could do. There was nothin' else to do. We're surrounded by the oil rigs, burning oil rigs and the smoke taking (sighs)... taking sniper fire in the back. Oh shit. I slammed him in the head with a can of dog food. - Mike sometimes confuses things a little. He was injured in the first gulf war. - That's okay. So Mike, I wanna talk to Maggie. Can you just step outside in the hallway for me? It'll just be a minute. Take these with ya. I can't use 'em. She'll just be a minute. So that's your big surprise mystery witness? I can't help you because you are obviously lying for your husband. - No, no, no I'm not. - This guy is a fake. - Nope. - Yes, he is a fake. - No he's not, listen-- - I don't have time. - Listen, the clerk was afraid. - I'm guessing you met him at some vet medical facility or somewhere on the street? - He lied about Rick to the cops, okay? Mountain can free Rick. - No Mountain can't free anyone. Mountain doesn't know what planet he's on. - For four years I've tried everything. - One lie doesn't justify another, alright? - I've tried social media, private investigators, lawyers. I've drained my savings. - I don't have time for... Okay listen, you're gonna have to go. - Please, I've borrowed money that I can't pay back to people. I didn't know what else to do. - Shh, here it is. Your husband is not getting out of jail. If you do not move on, this will destroy your life. This will destroy you. (soft soothing music) - What? No, that's bullshit. No! They cannot do that. No! Are you kidding me? They just had him in solitary. Is Rick okay? - Yeah he's fine, he's fine. He got into some kind of scuffle with his celly. - The cocksucker? What happened, did he come onto him? - I don't know what happened. All I know is there was a fight over somethin' and Rick got 45 days in the hole. - What am I supposed to do? I can't see him, I can't talk to him for 45 days. What am I supposed to do? - I don't know Maggie, I don't know. Everything's gonna be alright. It's in God's hands now, okay? - Terrific. Terrific 'cause he's doin' a bang-up job. Look, I gotta go Rego, I can't take this any more. This just sucks. - Everything's gonna be alright. I'll watch over him in here. It's gonna be fine. Just be strong out there, hang in there okay? - I gotta go. (mellow guitar music) - I thought you might be hungry. There's some toast and fruit out here if you want it. OJ, too. Well if you get hungry, the tray's right here. (door knocking) Maggie, hey I know you're going through something. I've been going through something for 10 years or longer. I started getting anxiety when I was a kid and I didn't tell anyone about it. I started hurting myself, cutting myself. I'm just really worried about you right now and I don't want you to hurt yourself. I'm here and I can listen if you wanna talk, okay? Did you hear me? - Yeah, I heard you. Thanks. Thank you, I appreciate that. - Yeah. You scared me. You should try meditation, I can show you how. - I don't need to mediate. I need a drink. You want a drink? - You mean a drink drink? - Yeah, you got anything? I'm out. - Well yeah, my mom she left behind a lot of alcohol. You can have some. What do you like? - Anything. - Now? - Here's to staying positive and testing negative. (glasses clinking) What do you think? - Yeah, I like it. It's tart. I like it. What's that? - Tequila and triple sec straight up. Then we freeze it for later. It's my signature drink. - What's it called? - Nasty Fuckin' Bitch. - (chuckles) This is weird. Isn't this weird? - Slow down. So why can't you go outside? - Why do people think? People think I can't go outside. I go outside. I have good days and I have bad days. - Well I thought you were afraid of goin' outside. - I'm not afraid. I'm just... How do I explain it? You know how some people get paralyzed when they have to give a speech? Well I get these crushing waves of panic when I'm out in public or if I'm preparing to go out. My safe zone has a tendency to fluctuate on its own. Come on, let's go outside. - Well now you're cured. All you needed was some booze. (Chet chuckling) (Chet grunting and coughing) - That's a strong one. You make me feel safe. - To me. - Wow, that's strong. Okay. - Maybe we should save the rest for tomorrow night. - Oh, you think I'm drunk? (Maggie mumbling) I'm barely buzzed. - No, you're drunk. - I'm not drunk, I weigh more than you. Here. To Nasty Fuckin' Bitches. - Hoorah. He's in for life, my husband Rick. - Prison? That must be hard for you and him. - To life. - L'chaim. (Chet hurling) - (groans) I should've cut you off. - No, no, this is how I should feel every day. Alive with people and just... (Chet hurling) (laughs) I think I just vomited out of my nose. - I can't believe you don't have any aspirin. - I think I vomited out of my nose. - Here, come here. Didn't you ever drink before in high school? - No. No! My doctor had me on hardcore shit, man. Just panic disorder meds. Stuff made me down on myself, man. It took away my boner. Fuck that, I like booze. Let's have another shot. - Cheers. - That's not a shot. - Take it, drink it. - Mmm that tastes like Halloween. (Chet hurling) - Chet, never again. - Hey Maggie, what's goin' on? Later, Frannie. - Alright. So what, d'you bring back my van? - No. Sorry, I just didn't wanna risk it. Guess you heard about White Eagle? - Uh, no. He was in here a couple days ago. - He's alive? - Yeah, he's alive. Well okay, he rolled in here on a wheelchair but he's alive. He's banged up. Shit, what did you... You know what? I don't wanna know. Just sit down. - Did the police come? - No. - He probably doesn't want me to tell my side of the story. - Well when I asked him what happened, he told me some bullshit story about some drunk vatos ran him over with a car. Oh, so that was you. Okay, you know what? You should stay away. - Yeah. About that night-- - Just forget about it. We'll just move forward, okay? How are you doin'? You doin' good? You look good. - Thanks. Yeah, things are okay. - Good. - No no Frannie, I can't. - Jesus, Lord get over yourself. I'm looking for a condom, okay? (laughs) Here. I owe you for your last week. Take it. Put it in your pocket. Don't spend it on alcohol, okay? - I won't. Thanks. - You're welcome. Get outta here, devil dog. - [Radio Announcer] Could you describe what was going on with you and why you wanted help at the time? - [Caller] I'm very depressed. I was always very uncomfortable in social situations. Extremely uncomfortable. - Chet? Chet? You dumped the trash? - Yeah, no big deal. - Uh no, when you do go out to get the mail or to dump the trash, it's sprint out and back in as soon as possible. Here you all are casual and shit. Damn. - You going to the market? - Yeah, you need something else? - You goin' to the Food Emporium across town or the Super City Shopper? - Food Emporium. Did you wanna go with me? - Yeah, I was thinkin' about it. - Yeah? Come on, I could use the company. - Yeah but I have to create a video file right now for a client so maybe next time. (soft guitar music) - Maggie, Maggie! (both chuckling) - Do you mind me workin' out here? - No, no. Here, it's called Gladiator. A lot of people think that's where the idea for Superman came from. - Philip Wylie. Okay thanks, I'll check it out. - Cool. - Hey, you ever box? - No. - You wanna learn something? - Hey can we just do it not in the face? I don't wanna get ringworm or anything. - It's clean, you're not gonna get ringworm. - Do you sanitize this thing after every use? - Yes, I'm a clean person. (Maggie grunting) There. - Wow this feels like pretty macho stuff to have on, huh? (gloves clashing) - It's just to protect your face so if somebody comes at you like-- - No no no! (chuckles) Ha ha ha, okay. - I'm just playin'. Okay, so this is your proper stance. Okay? Left is your jab, right hand is your power. You're gonna put your left foot forward. Now you wanna stay strong, but don't lock your legs. - Okay. - Alright, now throw the jab and your wrist like this. Snap the wrist. Snap it. - Alright. - Snap it. Good. - So, why boxing? - My husband got me into it. Yeah? That's pretty macho for a girl. - One, two. - One, two. - There you go, now just keep repeating that with me. - Hey, how long were you in Iraq? - I did two tours. You look like a robot, just relax, relax. Yeah, yeah, loosen up some. Relax, be light on your feet. - Did you ever see anyone get killed? - What do you think? - I don't know, did you? - Yeah, I saw four friends get blown to bits by some lady with a bomb strapped under her burka. - I'm sorry I asked. Were you there when it happened? - Yup. It could've been me. I searched Iraqi women for explosives. Those fuckers were sending women with bombs across checkpoints and you never knew if somebody was taped up or not. Sometimes I wish I was still in. Right, lemme see that jab again. You watch any sports like NFL, MMA? - Yeah, I watch MLG Pro-circuit sometimes. - MLG? - Major League Gaming. - I should punch you in the vag for that. - Hey, you better not. - Ooh. - (laughs) See? You need to practice your boxing or somebody's just gonna-- - Okay let's go, let's go. Oh, you pushed me. Alright, let's go. Let's go, you wanna go? - I got you in the-- - Let's go, I'll pop you in the head. - Okay, I was just kidding, I was just kidding. I was just kidding. - (groans) You look like a retard. Let's go. - No no no, don't get serious. Don't get serious. I don't want to, I don't want to. (soft rock music) You're ripped. - I try. (grunts) - Can't do this. - I'm used to it, don't worry. You're doin' good. (both laughing) - Get up all the way, all the way, all the way. Good job. Almost. (phone beeping) - Wake up. You fell asleep. - I fell asleep? - Yeah. - [Radio Announcer] We have been asking more questions as a society and the answers are often extremely disturbing. There's a whole PR industry that sanitizes what we know about our food. So I needed to have Mr Genowitz on to tell us a little bit about the pork industry and specifically we're going to be looking at the story. (soft rock music) (muffled lyrics) - Here you go. Thanks. - Hey, what about these? Found them in the garage. - Christmas lights? - Yeah. Just trust me. That's you? - Yeah, that's me. - You look like a little peanut. (Chet chuckling) - That's Valentine's Day. That's my grandfather. My first panic attack. You'll like this one though. - Oh my God, what are you doing? - [Chet] That's a little hotel room show. - [Maggie] Who's this? - [Chet] That's my mom and dad. - She's pretty. - Yeah. (Chet grunting) - What is that? - Don't know. - Your back muscles aren't used to the boxing. C'mere, c'mere. (Chet grunting and chuckling) You like that? - Uh huh. - You like that shit too, don't you? (laughs) - Hey (laughs), stop! Come on, stop. (both laughing) - You slut. (laughs) - You. (laughs) - Tell me more about your family. - You tell me. You never tell me anything. Where do your parents live? - (scoffs) My dad ran off when I was born. Mom's in Nevada. Got one sister, Grace. She's a bitch. They don't talk to me anymore. - Why? - A million reasons? My mom didn't want me to join the Marines, strike one. She didn't want me to marry Rick, strike two. Then he went to prison and I refused to divorce him. (Maggie's mouth popping) - Sorry that must be hard. - Rick's PTSD was getting worse so I decided not to re-enlist. Maybe start a family. - Good hands. Sleep good tonight. - You're good. - I got it. - Yeah well, goodnight. - Night. - [Operator VO] An inmate from the Chino Men's Correctional Facility is calling. - Rick? You out of solitary? - Yeah babe, it's been 45 days. Did you forget? - No no no no no, I was sleeping. Sorry. (Rick coughing) - Hold on. - Are you okay? You're not smoking again are you? - Listen babe, this is important. Listen to me. Listen, I've been praying real hard since you were here last time and I remember all the things you told me about staying strong and being strong. I've been prayin' to God and guess what babe? He spoke to me. He spoke to me through a guard in solitary. I was in my cell and the guard came to deliver a meal tray, he opens the slot and he looks right through it. He looks right at me and he says, listen to this. He says, "The Lord wants me to let you know "that everything's going to be okay. "That you're on the right path." Do you believe that? - Yeah, that sounds great babe. - Then I got out of solitary yesterday and I saw Rego. Rego comes up to me and Rego says, "Hey, man," he goes, "My aunt, she's got a diner and guess what? "They're hirin' a new waitress." It's in town right nearby babe. So you got a job, you can come up here. You can be with me. Come on, we lost the house. There's nothin' there for you. You can come up here. You'd just be right here, be near me. We can file more appeals. We'll file more appeals 'cause God's with us now. We can do this. We can make this work. We can be strong now. - [Maggie] Get in. Took you long enough. - Sorry. - Are you okay? - No, can I help you? - Listen to this. The engine sounds funny. (engine whirring) - Easy, don't mess up my car. - Okay, just listen. - Just sounds like my engine, I don't hear anything. - Okay, hold on. I'm gonna pull forward just a little bit. - Just sounds like you're accelerating. (engine whirring) Hey. Hey! Whoa! - You've been wanting to do this, Chet. I've seen it on you, okay? Relax, relax. - You tricked me? - Look, you're fine okay? Just breathe. - I don't want to breathe out here. Are you kidding me? - Look just calm down, relax. - Don't touch me! God! - Just relax! - I'm getting out of the car. - Okay yeah good luck, break a leg. (eerie music) - Where are you taking me right now? - The mall. - I am not gonna go to the mall. I am not gonna go to the mall. Are you kidding? I'm not gonna go to the mall. Stop! Pull over, pull over! - Come on! Get the... You wanna get us both killed? Jeez, breathe. (foreboding music) - Ooh. - Dammit, wrong way. - Well go back then. - No. - Please, just go back. - Jesus, calm down. - Turn that off! I'm gonna puke. I'm gonna puke, I'm gonna puke, I'm gonna puke. - Alright, get it out, get it out. Alright, I'm stopping, I'm gonna stop. There look, okay? You're fine, just breathe. (Chet panicking) - Get it out, there you go. - I-- - Relax. You're fine, you're okay. What are you doing? Chet! Hey! Come on, get back in the car. You're fine Chet, just breathe. Hey. Chet, you okay? Chet. You okay? Are you gonna talk to me? Look, I'm sorry okay? Hey we can try again tomorrow. - Where are we? That's the stupidest thing you could do. - Look, I'm-- - You're so stupid! - I said I'm sorry. - Sorry doesn't fix anything. - Well I didn't know what this whole agoraphobia was, okay? I have the mentality of the Marines still. We adapt and overcome. - Well I didn't fucking enlist. - I really thought I could help you. - No! You are not a fucking psychiatrist! You don't even know anything! You don't know! That was dangerous! What were you thinking, huh? You're so lucky you're a girl or I'd beat the shit outta you. I don't care if you've been to Iraq or whatever. I don't care about that. - I just wanna help you, Chet. - Well you're not my girlfriend so I don't need you to fix me. - You think I wanna be with you? Be your girlfriend? Is that what you think? - I don't know! What do you want, huh? A boyfriend? A fuck buddy? - Ooh, wow! Wow wow wow wow wow! I try to fuckin' help you, you asshole. I don't need a fuck buddy, I have a fucking man. Wow. You know what? Why would I be with a little fucking pussy like you that's afraid of people? Ooh people and malls and air. Un-fucking believable. Oh yeah, you wanna know somethin'? Enjoy the atmosphere. 'Cause you know what the weather bimbo said? Today's air index quality's purple. Very unhealthy. So you know what, hope you survive the walk home. (soft guitar music) (SUV engine revving) Move, move! - Hey, hey! - I don't care. - Wait, that's my car! Are you kidding me? Maggie! Really? You're gonna do this. (Chet breathing heavily) Okay. * There is no one left here to talk with * * I'm talking to myself * Pick up and put down the receiver * * I'm talking to myself * Forever's not a word you should trust * * Sunshine national dust * Forever's not over yet (birds chirping) (door knocking) - [Chet] Maggie, can I come in? Please? - Just gimme a second. Yup, you can come in. - I'm really trying to let go of my anger right now. You don't know how hard that walk home was. - You gonna kick me out? If you want me to-- - Would you just shut up and let me talk? Okay? I know you meant well but you... I'm sorry for what I did and said. - Me too. I'm starting to forget him. The last time I saw him, he changed. I'm just forgetting him. His smell. He like had this smell and this taste when he used to kiss me. My lips got so sore. I would get drunk off his kisses. - I think I love you. I know you think it's 'cause I'm lonely but I'm not. All this time we've spent together like a real couple. I've felt something from you too. - I'm gonna visit him tomorrow. - Oh. Well he's a lucky guy. - Ms Mosey, would you come with me please? - I didn't have my visit yet. - Yes ma'am, I know that. Would you please follow me. Officer Madison's goin' to escort you. - Escort me where? Cut the shit, what happened? - [Forrester] Officer Madison will take you in. - Please, ma'am. - How did it happen? - [Madison] They said it was from pneumonia. (soft, somber music) - I just wanna see him. - No. No Ms. Mosey, no. - I wanna see my husband. Ms. Mosey, no. - I wanna see my husband. - Ms. Mosey, no! - Get off of me! - Call for assistance. Ms. Mosey, no! - [Maggie] Get off of me! Rick, Rick, Rick! - [Forrester] No, no, please! - Get the fuck off of me! - I got this. (engine revving) (soft guitar music) (guitar strumming) - How'd it go? Hey, you okay? - Everything's gonna be okay. (Rick coughing) I need a doctor, you fuck! Maggie. - Maggie. Are you okay? Hey, whoa. Hey, what are you doin'? Hey can you tell me what's goin' on right now? Are you okay? (soft piano music) (Chet mumbling) Will you please tell me what's goin' on with you right now? * What are you doing here * My familiar, my familiar * I thought we parted ways * But you keep coming back for more * * My familiar, my familiar * My familiar * You * You know what I said * You know that I said * Get out of my head * Get out of my head * Why don't you listen * I'm * Through with you (Chet mumbling) (foreboding music) (engine revving) - [Radio Announcer] How difficult is it to pick up that phone and talk about hey, I'm having a bad day. - [Caller] Took me eight years. So, yeah, it took me eight years to be able to actually ask for help. My doses actually ended up going down. There are times when you're suffering with mental health issues and you don't wanna deal with people. You don't wanna commit. (soft vocal music) * I saw you there in your hiding place * * Where you were scared of being found * * And the dogs that chase you down * (muffled radio chatter) * And I heard you there with your lying mouth * * Tryin' to hide your flaws in cigarette smoke * * But I tasted you (singers humming) * Ooh survive with me * Ooh survive with me * And I walked with you on that winter night * * I was the moon the unblinking eye * * And you saw me too (singers humming) * Ooh survive with me * Ooh survive with me (laptop beeping) - Hey. - [Ann] Hi, how's it going? How's Diego working out? - Oh, he's better than I thought he'd be. - [Ann] Sorry. - No, no. Yeah, let's just say he's cool. - Chet Chet, listen to me. I read something interesting that Stephen King said in an interview. I think it's a really good analogy-- * I will take your (mumbles) * I will take them all - Yeah, I'm listening. * I will take your (mumbles) * I will take (mumbles) * I will take them all (energetic Celtic music) (birds chirping) (soft guitar music) * I miss the girl that I miss * That I should have kissed * Like in some sad movie * I miss the money I had * And I'm feelin' bad * And well wouldn't you be * Boxes and chairs on the stairs * * Don't go up there * Or you'll be sorry * And all the snow on the moon * Will be melting soon * Why should we worry * Every little thing that I say * * Comes out the wrong way * In the sculpture garden * Now I'm calling you on the phone * * Pick up if you're home * I beg your pardon (country instrumental)
