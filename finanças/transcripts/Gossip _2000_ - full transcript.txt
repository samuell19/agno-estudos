We all have good times and bad, but for one person, today will prove to be special. The question right now is, which of Sweden's top nine actresses will be chosen for Greta Garbo's 1933 classic film part, in "Queen Christina". Greta, the Stockholm girl who became Hollywood's greatest star, was only 28 when her career was crowned with this role. One of the nine actresses has a birthday today. Happy 40th birthday, Rebecca Olsson-Frigårdh. It must be every Swedish woman's dream to wake up next to Åke Frigårdh, Sweden's sexiest man. WHO WILL BE THE NEXT GARBO? Queen Christina, screen test, Rebecca Olsson-Frigårdh. Queen Christina, screen test, Alexandra Furustig. Queen Christina, screen test, Stella Lindberg. Queen Christina, screen test, Karin Kalters. Screen test, Eivor Pellas. Screen test, Georgina Seth. Cecilia Falk. Git Jeppson. Molly Fischer. - And now. - Farewell. - I thank almighty God. - Who caused me to be raised. Eivor Pellas. I thank almighty God that I was born of royal stock. And raised to be the Queen of so large. - Alexandra Furustig. - I thank almighty God. I thank almighty God... No. I thank almighty God that I was born of royal blood... Shit! - I thank almighty God. - That I was born of royal stock. I thank all the mighty God. - I thank almighty God. - That I was born of royal stock. - Fuck! - That I was raised of... No. And now... Fan... Yes, I'm happy. No, I'm not happy. That's up to you. - Let me think two seconds. - No... I... nej... Thank you very much. Thank you. And now, farewell. - I thank almighty God. - That I was born of royal stock. - And raised. - To be the queen. Of so large and mighty a kingdom. - A kingdom. - A kingdom. - A kingdom. - A kingdom. - A kingdom. - But now... Farewell. I don't know what I've done, Sister Agnes. I was alone in the oratory collecting the prayer books after vespers. I was standing by the altar, it was dark and still, when suddenly I felt a presence in the eastern vault. Like someone was watching me, staring at me. An invisible power drew me towards the colonnade. And, suddenly, there he was - a man. Turn on the TV, this is something you have to see. Lucky we turned this job down. He didn't kiss the back of my hand, but... The palm! Sister Angelica, it's divine! Right... I'm off now. First day of rehearsals. Wish me luck? I'm a bit nervous. Sister Angelica... You see... it didn't stop at that, Sister Agnes. I have sinned. I believe so. - Not...? - No. I don't know - the Lord has entered me. - Do you believe it's God? - It's God... of course it is. A scene from "The Road to Samarkand", which opens tonight. It reminded me of "The Sound of Music". Yes, I got that Christopher Plummer feeling. What has she done with her hair! Perhaps it's more about you two? That's a really odd comparison, because "The Sound of Music" is more like "Toy Story". How was it to work together? Wonderful. We've really bonded. - Have you seen this ad? - No. May I? Worst thing I've ever seen. He looks like Captain Hook, and you look like something out of a Greek drama. Stop it, Thomas. It's great, except... ...he's got top billing even though I've got the lead. Eivor, how can you choose to work with shit like this? But you compete for other parts, like Queen Christina, for example. Garbo's old part. How does it feel to pursue the same part, having just worked together? This is getting a bit tedious. We don't compete all the time, as you seem to think. What if I get the part? Myself, I feel it isn't really that important. So, what do you think of Cecilia's chances of getting the part? Well, it may be a bit difficult with that belly. The pregnancy that's on everybody's lips. How do you feel about it being so public? I've done several interviews about being a single mother and actress... You don't know what it's like yet. I do, it's a lot of work. - But you don't know that yet. - There's a lot I don't know. We were going to do "Joan of Arc". Four weeks before rehearsals start, you back out. Why do you choose to work with the worst bullshitting poseur in the entire business? How do you deal with all the gossip about who's the father? I usually deal with it by saying "no comment". It's personal. She goes in to do an audition and comes out pregnant! By the producer? Maybe, but that would be for the sake of you media people. This is part of my personal life, it's my decision. Okay? But the film is something we're really proud of. There aren't many films today featuring strong women. Do you feel strong about your role as a mother? She's leaving. I bet you she'll walk out! We agreed to talk about our film, that's all. This is ridiculous! Please, sit down. She's going! These things happen. I hope someone will take care of Cecilia. We'll continue with you, Georgina, and the question... Who do you think looks most like Garbo? - In what context? - The actresses pursuing the part. I don't know... Cecilia has a similar upper lip. - Hi. - It's today. It's today. Myself, I'm moving towards something different. I've reached a crossroads in my life, where I feel... ...that I want to develop my music further. He's professional, he's capable, competent and creative. Don't knock him, because I think he can bring to this musical an intellectual substance and lightness the piece needs. I'm really happy we'll be working together, so don't drag him into it. - Your CD will be out in a few weeks. - Next week, I hope. So you're singing a track for us, your CD is out next week. Fucking bitch! - You'll be singing a song from it... - "Mountains". Are you okay? I think the baby's on its way. - Could you call a taxi? - Sure. Don't move. Hurry! Hurry! One, two, three... It's coming. Darling, come here! Look. She's good, you know. - She's good? - Yeah... And good-looking. - So why did you leave her? - I didn't. She left me. Alex speaking. Not at all, we're up. We're watching it. It's good - Pontare and Georgina. It's excellent! How ridiculous. Ridiculous! We were on a camping holiday when we had our first. I had to park the car by the road and haul her into the caravan. - Hard work. Is this your first? - Yes. Oh dear, then it'll take time. Oh, god...! So I said, if any of these girls can make it in Hollywood, it's Cecilia. Someone who'll make us Swedes proud and won't embarrass us. Here's a tip if you go to Hollywood: See Disneyland - it's brilliant! Say you do get this Christina part, which I'm definitely not utterly convinced you will, because rumour has it all nine of you are sure you'll get it. But if you got it, would you back out of "Argentina"? - What day is it today? - It's Friday. You don't remember? - I know what I'm facing today. - What you're facing? You've forgotten what day it is. That's too much! What do you say? Hello, Magnus. - Do you know where Karin is? - No. She didn't come home last night. Shit... - Weren't you together last night? - Yes, but the place was packed... - Where the hell can she be? - Could she be at her mum's? At least I've had a good night's sleep. I haven't been sleeping lately, what with all this America shit. Are you doing it too? "I thank Almighty God that I was born" "under a wandering star"...! - I could do Christina myself. - Don't be snide, she is your wife. I'll be glad when they decide who gets the part. Listen... I'm sure she's at her mum's. Call and check. Sorry if I disturbed you. - Bloody idiot. - What did I say? That he should call her. What have I done? He'll call her straight away. Answer...! Mum? Hi, it's me. Nothing's wrong. I'm sorry to call you so early. Mum, please listen.. You're upset, you feel let down, angry and hurt, and you're envious of Claes. But I can take that. I just want us, before I leave, to pull ourselves together. I'd like you to say "good luck", and we'll see each other tonight. Well, good luck, then... Thanks. You know what disappointment is. Who did the crying at the Swedish Film Awards? - You were so bloody disappointed. - Stop it, you're embarrassing. Yes, it was embarrassing for you. This is embarrassing for me! I wasn't bloody crying over not getting that ugly thing! Your disappointment then is nothing compared to how I feel now. - You've forgotten my 40th birthday. - I haven't forgotten it. - I haven't! - This is just a piece of shit. It means nothing when compared to your forgetting my 40th birthday! Look, it's gone! Gone with the wind. That's how much it means to me - zero! You're bloody insane. Get dressed so we can go. Call for a cab. I'm off now. The girls have riding lessons at three. - Have you read this? - I've skimmed through it. - Why? Where did you find it? - In your bag. "Burning Passion." Scene 31: "Marianne and Per embrace." "Slowly, Per works Marianne's swimsuit top loose." - That's only the first draft. - Be quiet. Scene 22: "They are sitting on a park bench, kissing passionately. "At this moment, the world around them doesn't exist." Scene 7... "Marianne is naked by the window." "She pulls the curtain aside, the warm sunlight gilds her body." - We're going to discuss the nudity. - Stop. Wait. Scene 1, the opening scene: "Marianne enters the bedroom" "reaches under the covers and grasps Per between his legs." - What the hell is this? - It's a romantic drama. Set in bedrooms and showers? Are you actually going to do it? It's one of the best parts I've ever been offered, Gregor. - Who's playing the bloody guy? - Erik. - Which Erik? - Erik Nordin. - Your Erik? - That was ten years ago. Ten years or a hundred, that's irrelevant. - You're jealous. It's just a job. - Driving a bus is a job. - We'll talk tonight. - You bet we will! See that the kids eat something. There are meatballs in the fridge. - Look, a Golden Beetle. - Really. "Swedish Film Awards 1996." "To Rebecca Olsson-Frigårdh as Elisabeth in Time of the Lilac." - I saw that, she was brilliant. - I don't agree. I was really moved. I even cried. They should award one to my daughter. - Did you ever win one? - I'm on the stage, we don't do that. What's it like being married to the sexiest man in Sweden? - Fabulous. - Right... I hear you're going to Hollywood. I saw it in the paper. Thanks! Look at that... That'll make me popular at home. - Today is D-Day. - Funerals are never easy. It's not that. Today we'll find out who plays Queen Christina. The part is yours. That's obvious, isn't it? The part's mine. - There is only one Queen Christina. - It's cool. It's me. It's part of my personality. I'm made for it. Otherwise I'll be too old, I'll have missed the boat. - This is your boat. - I'm not too old. The boat's mine. So I said to the wife, that if any of these ten has a chance, it's Rebecca, if you want my opinion. Will you be going with her, Åke? How would that feel? To see Rebecca kissing Kevin Costner in a sex scene? "I'm the sexiest guy in Sweden." "Who cares? I'm Al Pacino." You know what I mean? Shit...! Those guys, they've had women. The wife once said she'd like to kiss Kevin Costner. I told her, "Get this into your head - it's a job." "I drive a taxi, they're actors. They kiss, and that's that." - Did you catch Cecilia on TV? - Yes, I did. Why did she do such a thing? You're friends and all that. It'll be in all the tabloids. If she keeps the identity of the kid's dad secret, they're going to ask her about him in an interview like that. She looks happy, though. How are you? You wanted a kid, didn't you? - Yeah, I lobbied for kids. - But nothing happened? Let's not talk about that. We're here to make money. - Has Gregor read the script? - I don't have a script. - No, the feature film script. - Christ, yes! - And? - He liked it. He thinks it's great, me playing a mature woman... So he doesn't mind you doing a lot of love scenes with your ex? What, with Erik? No, he knows it's just a job. Pirkko? This is Gregor, good morning. - Have you started? - Yes, we're running. Great. I want you to give Magnus a message from me. If he doesn't do his job today, I'll find someone else. But I can't tell him that! Yes, you can. We have to get things moving here. - That's not my job! - Tell him I said so. Keep me informed, preferably with good news, but call me anyway! Yeah, yeah. I'll be in touch. Arsehole! How long have we known each other? It must be... nine years now. We've always been honest... ...and open with each other, haven't we? - Haven't we? - What's on your mind, Kerstin? There's something I have to ask you. And I'm not so certain I want to know the answer. - Are you and Pontus having an affair? - How could you think such a thing? I'm sorry. I was convinced it was you. But ever since I returned from Vienna he's been so strange. I'm convinced he's got someone on the side. He's so distant. He won't touch me. - Maybe he's just overworked? - Yes, maybe that's it. I'm sorry. And cut! Brilliant, girls, just brilliant! That was great. We've got it. Shouldn't she show any emotions? Could she lie to her face? If you have to lie, then do it properly. Isn't this a bit much? I feel such a victim. She is a victim. That's what makes it so powerful. - Is the gate clean? - I don't get this film! Let's prepare for the bathing scene. What bathing scene? This Hollywood thing... What'll you do if you get it? - I won't get it. - But if you do? I won't get it, so there's no need to worry. - Right? - Why do you say that? One of you is going to get it. You must have thought about it. You must be thinking: - "Of course I'll go." - I'd be on the first plane out. It's a wonderful feeling, I promise you! - Are you scared? - No, this is how I planned it. If you're that busy, then why are you having a child now? I'm 41, I'm running out of time. If you won't give me a caesarean, I'll go to the senior physician. - End of subject. - Cecilia... I'm convinced you're strong enough to do it yourself. I think you're being silly. Talk to the father. - Are you doing that photo shoot? - Must we discuss everything today? Of course I am, I can't back out now. I'm due there in two hours. The picture will be like this, the upper body, top of the bra, that's all. So why all that talk about the colour of your knickers? Stop it. That was their idea. It won't happen. It's in the 50's style, I guess. It's a serious piece. Some young photographer dreaming up things. It's got nothing to do with the interview. It's a personal profile in a glossy. They don't have porn on the cover. I'm so tired of these cocky teenagers! Bloody crap. Okay, relax. - I am relaxed, but this is hard. - I'll come in with you and strip. It's Hollywood and knickers. Christ knows what I'm doing here. I have to go in and... Please, don't start on that again. Hello! Sorry I'm late, another patient took longer than expected. - I'm Annika Persson. - Åke. - Do you feel ready? - Yes. I feel ready. This is the container. Just unscrew the cap. You know what to do, right? We only need a few drops. - Are the clients here? - Yes, they're waiting. They're very excited about seeing Alex and... - Who wrote this? - I did. Could you read it to me, so I could hear you say it? Why? Is there something that's unclear? If there's anything you don't understand, we can change it. We'll give you the artistic freedom to change it. But, the essence of the piece can't be changed now. They're waiting in there, and we're paying for it. And I'm paid to say it on TV. I'm a renowned actress with a familiar face, that's what you pay me for. But I can't say things that are formulated like this, things I don't even understand. - Why don't we just try it out? - No... - We have to talk this through. - Ten minutes? What a bitch! - I'm one of Sweden's best actresses! - That's true. That's why I didn't like what I saw. It's all about having range. To be able to do something... Something absolutely ridiculous. I don't know who looked worse, he or you. Listen, Mum, I... I really love you, Mum, but sometimes you're really hard on me. - You're so... - It's a hard profession. You have to stick to what you have a talent for. It's essential. You can't make a display of yourself on television like that. What do you mean, "a display"? It was rehearsed. - That's even worse. - I'm releasing a CD, you know. If the Americans were to see it, you wouldn't get near "Christina". Oh, but I think so. If they've seen this, they'll see I have a wide range. That I have more inside me. That I'm the real thing, one hundred per cent! I've got something to tell you later. I need to talk to you, too. I'll see you after the performance. - No reception. - Hello? - What? - Why "hello", in English? - I said "hallå". - No, you said "hello". Admit it, you thought it was the American producer. - I haven't even thought about it. - You'd do anything for that part. I thank almighty God that I was born of royal stock. Me too. And raised to be the queen of so large and mighty a kingdom. Excuse me, where's the exit? Well, hello... - What are you doing here? - And you, are you...? I did think so, but it was a false alarm. And you? My mum had some minor surgery, she's here for a check-up. - Anything serious? - No, luckily. Are you on your way out? It's this way. - How's he doing? - She's just gone to the loo. Tell her I'll wait outside. - How's Åke? - Look, here he is! Hello, Cecilia. - Everything all right? - Sure. And you, are you due now? No, it was a false alarm. I'll take the sample. Look at that, well done! We'll keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best. See you around. Wait for me. - What was that? - Sperm. We've been trying for years. I've tested, now it's his turn, and he's completely... How I wish I had your belly. Take off your glasses. Harald was an actor we shall all remember. He'll be leaving a great void behind him. He's a man we miss, deeply and sincerely. Many people owed him the deepest gratitude. More than those who are present today appreciate him for an eminent performance. And as a token of our gratitude, we'll listen now to a few words of poetry. - Georgina. - Mum... Don't make any mistakes. Mum, it's a funeral, not a theatre performance. - Why aren't you reciting the poem? - Nobody asked me, Mum. A painted eyelid is lifted Heavily... and slowly Iris and pupil soon appear in view O, actor, ready for the show! What splendid entertainment shall radiate from your gaze? Now, we don't have to talk, but it'd be a shame not to. - Don't you have time, or what? - Oh, yes. We've got fifty minutes left. - Where are you? - In church. - At the hospital. - It's Cecilia. We have to meet. - By Strindberg? - When? - A quarter to. - Okay. Bye. Oops! Has she got the energy to see you? She's worried about the child. Did you see this morning, when she walked out? I mean, there are limits. It was live, after all. You can't be ruled by your emotions. And who is the father of the child? Any idea? Göran. Göran... No. Are you all right, Georgina? He still sleeps. It looks hopeless. There is no hopelessness here. Our world rests on hope. Evil powers besiege us, trying to destroy us. We must send word. - How long do we have? - Not long. Today is Advent Sunday. Will we ever experience the magic night? Will we be able to wake him up? Without him, we'll never see Christmas again. Cut! Who wrote this? You did? It's so idiotic, it's embarrassing. Molly, look left. Look at me. Ashtray. Thanks. What a way to earn a living, appearing on the TV Advent show. It's beautiful in there, though. I don't know. Look at me. Turn to the right. Hello there. How's Santa doing, is he dead or alive? I'd prefer it if he were dead. Hi, darling. Is your mum feeling any better? I just asked Karin why you chose Stella for the part. I needed someone who looks like my mother. She's the mirror image. - Who cares about your mother? - He does. It's not about who you look like, but about acting. Right, and she's a talented actress. Isn't she? Really? Have you been to see the film? - Of course I went. - Why? To see what is no longer here. - What is it that's missing? - It's a 'we'. It's family, it's closeness... A closeness which is the closest you can get, and then... ...it's gone. You're saying you don't exist if you're not in a film or on the stage? You could put it that way. - So where are you now? - Nowhere. Yes, you're sitting here with me, aren't you? You're sitting here talking to me, and I'm here. There's no camera, no audience - just you and me. And you're here. So why not - exist? Watch it, or I'll change therapists. Git, will you promise me something? Don't go and see that film again. It's not good for you. Never stop loving me. I love you now, but I know... ...that I won't in five years' time. You've already stopped loving me. Admit it! Admit it! Admit that you've already stopped loving me! You mustn't stop loving me. I can't live without you, Alexander. You existed before we met, and you'll exist after. Emily. Oh, it's you. Yes. I'm waiting for Viktor to call. Yes, he's coming on Sunday. I can't bear it. I drink. I smoke. I forget. But I'll never forget. I love him. I'll always love him. But he doesn't want me. - What do you think? - She can't dance. She can't sing either. - What can she do? - She can fill a theatre... Eivor Pellas. - What a circus this morning. - Full marks for entertainment. It was extremely entertaining. It takes star quality to make an exit like that. Or a panic-stricken woman. - Is that how you feel? - A bit. I called you, because I felt I had to tell you who the father is. At last. I can't, though. I just can't, I've promised not to. No one's saying you can't dance. He must've said you don't dance so well. I heard him say, clearly, "She can't dance, she's got rubber legs." Rubber legs? That can't be what he said. He meant himself. Pischti is dead nervous about working with you. He goes on and on about it. This renowned choreographer is actually nervous about working with you. - I don't understand what's wrong. - I can't say what's in that script. What's wrong? It's not as if it'll be reviewed in the arts pages. The Swedish Film Awards jury won't say: "No awards for you this year, you were so bad in that commercial." And your colleagues know you have to do it for the money. That's the reality of it. They're just envious, they'd like to do it themselves. Hello, Karl-Johan? Hi, it's me. Yes, it's Classe. Listen... Can you get here right now? Grab a cab and come over. Yes, this afternoon. Straight away. Well, I have... ...a slight problem. We had dance rehearsals this morning, and Eivor's a bit nervous. Eivor, we're expecting you on stage. Eivor on stage, please. Git! Hello! - Great to see you! - Isn't it? I'm seeing my favourite director, Tomas Berg. - I'm also seeing him. - Seriously? "Joan of Arc"? He's going to love you. - Maybe we'll work together. - Of course. That'd be wonderful. Great. You're beautiful. Keep that. What is this? - Why are we wearing handcuffs? - It looks great. It's fantastic. But what does it have to do with the interview? Molly, support me here. - I already feel cheap in this corset. - The corsets look fantastic. Maybe they do, but you've got enough rolls now, and I refuse to appear on that cover in handcuffs. I have a family to consider. - Rebecca, wait. - No, I can't do it. - Don't make a scene. - I won't do it. Would you ask this of the minister of culture? It's degrading. - I'd even ask the Prime Minister. - I bet you would. Take them off! Baby! It's so wonderful to see you! How's it going? Darling, I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting. - The prettiest foot in the business. - The shoe, at least. - So how are things? - Welcome back. Shit! It's always so much fun! Jesus Christ! - I've got a family! - Fucking bitch! Well, thanks! Why did I say that? It's so great to see you. I'm really looking forward to working with you. I've dreamt about it - about us working together again. I knew it would happen. I feel so happy! - Heard anything from the States? - No. Maybe tonight. - Has Eivor heard anything? - No. I'll be glad when it's all over, it's been hell. I've spent so many nights boosting her confidence. I must know those lines by heart. It's exciting, though. Have you read the new version? - Of "Joan of Arc". - Yes, of course. - What do you think? - It's wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. Two minutes. I'm just checking the costumes. - Where's your script guy? - He's left. - He was going to alter the script. - Where's Alex? She's taking a break in the dressing room. The tension's rising in there. They're starting to wonder... What's she up to? - She's a woman. - So's my mother. - Hi. - August 13, 1953. - Dinner with the Prime Minister. - We're doing the following scene. On the balcony, where you tell him you want his child. You look like her. You really do. Only this profile. He pushes my head this way. "Only show this profile. You look just like her." So you didn't want the part? He never asked me. And I don't look like her. Besides, he says he couldn't bear to see me in bed with another man. And with another woman...? Soon the police will be waiting outside Hurry, please be on your way Your wings will carry you across the sea My life, Juan Roca, farewell A righteous killing it was Now I must flee my home shores But in my heart your voice will help me to rejoice Each day, Marie My co-actors? - You know how particular I am. - Co-actors? I want to know who they are. Come on! - Who will it be? - How do you mean, "who"? Who will I be playing opposite? If I'm to burn, I want to know who's with me. - You know how particular I am. - Who's in the cast, you mean? Well... How do you mean "play opposite"? The narrator is a solo part. You enter... You enter the stage by yourself and address the audience. You're not playing opposite anyone. Are you saying that I would play the narrator? - Kerstin and I went for a swim today. - How nice. She asked me if we were having an affair. What did she say? "Are you and Pontus having an affair?" I said no. - And then what? - She believed me. - Where were you? - In Saltsjöbaden. Does it matter? - I'll get a divorce. I love you. - I love you. I couldn't survive without these moments with you. I couldn't survive without this restaurant. Here we can be alone. Let this restaurant remain our little love nest. Cut! - Stella, where are you? - What do you mean? You're saying we're at our restaurant, in our little love nest. This is a balcony. We've just had dinner with the Prime Minister, half the cabinet and their wives. You're talking about our love nest. You've got the wrong scene! This is scene 86. You're doing the lines from scene 47. It might be good to do the same scene at the same time. I'm sure everyone agrees with that. Sorry, I feel a bit muddled. Are you going for a walk now? Come back, Åke. Can't you be professional? Are you talking to me about being professional? - Learn your fucking lines! - I made a mistake, is that so bad? You're always making mistakes. It's bad enough as it is, having to work with you. But if you learn your lines and play the right scenes, you'll make things more bearable, for everyone involved. Claes? Do we have to pitch this song so high? It's the worst possible key for me, between head voice and chest voice. If I force it any further, my larynx will end up in my mouth. But you couldn't play Joan of Arc, it has to be a young girl. She's a virgin - the Maid of Orléans. With all due respect, you can't portray a virgin, not even on stage. You sound like all the other fucking old men. Where's your courage? Your creativity? So Joan of Arc's a young maid? I can be one hundred years old, or one. I'm an actress. I can play absolutely anything - if you have faith in me. I need you, you're the best. Cut the crap, I don't need your flattery. I know. Be realistic. I don't understand why actors have such a problem with that. Don't you ever look in all those mirrors on your walls? - How long have we been friends? - Since drama school. We've made several films together and we've both enjoyed it. But I must say that now that you're directing, you're behaving like a bloody woman! You're lacking in humility with respect to yourself, actually. There is something in what you do that I really like, some kind of broken quality. It's not about having humility or not. It's just that... ...this is the wrong key for me. Can't you hear that? What is this bloody film? I'm sorry, Rolf, but I can't do it. I'm sorry, Rolf, but I can't do it. Darling, I'm of the same mind. I think those agency guys are just as ridiculous as you do. In the same way that Oedipus has blind eyes, your character has a voice that doesn't sound like it's singing. Please, we've discussed this. We can't analyse every single aspect of this, dragging in politics, the spirit of the times, Oedipus and God knows what. This is a musical. We sing and we dance. Nine thousand people have already bought tickets. We're here to sing, dance and entertain. That's the deal. And we can do it, with a little help from you. This is how it is, either you and I do this, or another actor and another director will do it, and pocket the money. You're looking for Alex, aren't you? Have you seen Rolf? Listen, I've trusted you one hundred per cent. I thought you felt confident, it definitely looks that way. - You look like you are him. - Just show you've got balls! - Of course I will. - I can't do this on my own. No, no, we're doing it together. I love you, man! Charge up your batteries now. You look bloody great. Lipstick and all... We smash the music to pieces to go some place new, somewhere in the here and now. This musical isn't about music. Kalle, what... What were you whispering? A musical that isn't about music, isn't that a bit odd? Sounds strange to me. You know, today I've heard nothing but sarcasm from you. You in your black suit and those sunglasses. What's your game? If we're to achieve anything here, we have to drop this tone. I know, I slipped. I shouldn't get the wrong scene. But do you know why? We're doing a two shot, and that man, Åke Frigårdh, has his hands all over my face. You can't see me, he's stealing the entire scene. You have to trust me, I'll be doing a close-up there. - But, then... - He'll do this over the close-up. You called me in to sing this song, but all we do is talk. Are we going to work? Today happens to be my day off. Right... It's Kalle's day off today. Did you hear that, everybody? And still he's here. This film is about you, no one else. About my mother, that is. And you're playing her. There's no one else who could play her. - You're a terrible actress, and... - A terrible actress? - Terribly good. - Well, thanks. Of course. Christ almighty... We all need to relax a little here. Just find yourself as a director. I know, this is your first film. You're a great actor, but not a very good director. Sorry... I've come from a funeral. Harald was buried this morning. Is he dead? You see, I'm too old to give people a chance. Just get that straight. Andrea Fager is a good actress. She'll be brilliant, she'll be beautiful, lovely and innocent. She'll make a great Joan of Arc. I can accept that - I'm not bitter. What does hurt, is the way you treat me. That you, of all people, should treat me like this. Six weeks with that intellectual heavyweight. Be glad he's not on stage, he'd be there for a year. He's scared of you. Is he? But why, he knows what I'm like. Exactly. - And I put him forward for the job! - Did you? Yes! When Vicky refused, I insisted he'd do it. This is so difficult. And I know I won't get the Queen Christina part. Eivor, if anyone should get that part, it's you. - Why? - Charisma. - The others have that, too. - Not like you. - Maybe, but my English is bad. - They can always dub it. How do you feel about your hair? - Would you shave it off? - Will everyone do it? No, only the leading actress. Only Joan of Arc. I thought Git would be playing Joan of Arc. No, Joan of Arc is a young virgin, and... Git is a brilliant actress, but she's too old. You'll be perfect. Absolutely perfect. Take five! Clear the studio for rehearsal! Could we just run through the lines? We'll take it from... ...from where I went wrong. "I went for a swim with Kerstin..." "It isn't just about us, it's about your children, your wife" "and, above all, the nation." - It sounds ridiculous, "the nation". - That's how it was. Trust me. "Above all, the nation, you can't fail the nation." "It's about you." "It's about me. I can't live without you, I love you." - You've got to say you can't... - Stick to your own lines! - We're doing this because of you. - Do it again. - I need a cue. - He said it. Please start again. "It's about you, it's about me." "I love you. I can't live without you." "And I can't live without you, but we have to get used to the thought." - "I'm leaving, but I want your child..." - Love child. "...love child to remember you by." - Let's give it a go. - But there's more. Yes, there's more - have you learnt it? There's twenty people waiting. Let's give it a go. Come on, it's my mum and dad you're playing. It's nothing personal. Six weeks of this, it's like rehearsing with King Kong for six weeks. What about me? I've got a whole year ahead of me. I'm beginning to understand Tomas. Living with her would give anyone a creative block. - You scare her, that's all. - I scare her? Christ... I've got to face her now. So, thanks for coming in. You're mad about her. He's the love of your life. This is the key scene of the film. You may not believe in yourselves as a couple. I do, I've seen the takes. The screen is on fire. Let's do this now. I beg you, give it another go. Everybody prepare for a take! Close the doors! At least get rid of the snuff. That they even considered you for the "Queen Christina" auditions is a big bloody joke. Camera! - 204:3, take 2. - Clapper! Action! Stop it, someone might see us. I went for a swim with Kerstin this morning. You went for a swim with Kerstin? How nice. She asked me if we were having an affair. She asked you if we were having an affair? What did you say? I lied. Where were you? In Saltsjöbaden. Does it matter? We can't go on like this. Stop this. I've asked you to give me six months. That's all I'm asking for. Six months - then I'll leave her. I love you. I'll divorce her, because I love you. You mustn't leave me. This isn't only about us. It's about your children, your wife... and, above all, this nation. You can't fail the nation. But I love you. - I can't live without you. - Nor I without you. Though we must... we must learn. Learn to... Cut! Fucking phones! Sorry about this. Switch that damn thing off! You, come with me! Number one, it's your job to see to it that all phones are switched off. You just ruined one of the best scenes we've shot so far. - Switch off that damn phone! - It's yours. Mine? But I... That's beside the bloody point! - Why didn't you tell me? - I've told everybody. - You didn't tell me. - No, I forgot. You forgot... It's my job to be creative. It's your job to make sure I don't forget anything! Do you know how hard directing is? No, you don't. It's me. Where are you going? - I'm not feeling well. - What's wrong with you? Hello? Hello? - Who's that? - Gregor. - Something the matter? - It's a big mess. - Have you phoned the children? - No. I'll call them, don't worry. We'll talk later. Bye. No, reception was bad. - What's up? - I'm in my car, outside the studio. Please don't come inside. - If you don't come out, I'll come in. - No, please don't. I'll come out in five minutes. I'll be there. - Promise? - I'll be there. Bye. - That was great. - It's great to play opposite you. It's just that I thought you really didn't like me. What? You mustn't think that. I'm sorry for what I said earlier. I think we'll call it a day. We could never reproduce what we had in there today. It was a one-off. But Åke's going to Oslo tomorrow. 7 am tomorrow. We'll try again then. I believe in this film, I really do. If we can go on playing like this... It was so great. Cecilia, you said you wouldn't come here. We agreed you'd wait outside, and still you've come in. - Why do you do this to me? - I need to talk. I've just sent the team home, three hours early, so this had better be important. Those two just can't work together. Why does everything have to revolve around conflict? I don't get it. I hate conflict. So, what's up? Which bloody scene was that? - What... Why? - The one I just witnessed. Which scene have you worked on today? You know, I've read the script. - And Magnus isn't even here. - Someone's phone rang. In the middle of a scene we've been working on all day. And you stand there kissing, right in front of everybody? Come off it! Did I kiss her? - Yes, you were kissing her. - When? There are a lot of people who've been waiting for us for hours. Can't we just wander over there and get started? If you're going to do it, do it right. Watch me. Hang on... Turn the music off! - Pirkko, I can't hear you. - We've finished for the day. - What's up? - We've stopped for the day. Magnus's phone rang during the take, when the scene was finally working. And then the assistant director comes back in and tells us it's a wrap. Has he heard? About us? No, I haven't said a word. - Not to anyone? Not even to Kalle? - No, not to anyone. - Did you tell Molly? - Now you're being paranoid. - Let me talk to the bastard. - He's not here! Lovely day! Everyone's asking who the father is. I can't do this alone. What do you tell them? What do you think? That it's me? Listen, Pirkko. We'll finish this film, one way or another. I can't do this job much longer. Have a cup of coffee and calm down. Take care. The bloody idiot! Magnus, Gregor here. I'd be grateful if you could call me when you hear this. You wanted a child. You said I wouldn't be involved. Right, but I had imagined a more clinical situation. You wanted to do it for real, you wanted to go to bed. No... But it was on your initiative that it happened the way it did. Right? Candles, wine, a beautiful woman - of course I... Come on... You've got to take responsibility. You can't pretend I seduced you. Been showing your knickers today? So what have you been doing? Did you take the knickers off? I came to tell you I didn't do it, I did what you wanted me to. No, I don't want her lipstick on me. It's so bloody humiliating. What the hell are you up to? Are you seeing Stella? Give it to me straight, are you two having an affair? This is not right, I feel it in my bones, and I have a problem. I've a problem with Pischti and the band. I've a problem with the set, the costumes and my song. And I've a problem with you. I'm trying to be nice, be a good guy. And what the hell do I get back? When has anyone ever asked me.. "Magnus, how the hell are you?" It never happens. Grow up, will you? I just want you to be my friend. You agreed to help me, don't try to deny it! I am your friend. What do you want? I'm happy to help. I realise that at some point I have to tell Karin about this. - Haven't you told her? - Of course I haven't. - You haven't told Karin? - There hasn't been time. I'm not completely sure - is it really mine? What about Göran? I'll do anything if it's mine, but if it's Göran's... He'll have to face the music. You know what happened to that art director in Malmö. You're an actor and actors play other people. Those people don't always say and do things that you like. If you're playing a Nazi, you've got to be able to say you hate Jews in a credible way. Please go in and be this person who's saying this rubbish. I will not... I refuse to do this script. I won't do it. Hello? Hi, darling. I'm in deep shit. We're in deep shit. Thank god you're doing that commercial. I'm riveted to this chair, I can't move. That's how awkward I feel. I don't know what to do with myself. This just isn't right. About this morning - I'm sorry. You go ahead with your "Burning Passion". We need every penny we can get. I don't care about Erik, I know you're a pro. Sweetheart... Hurry home. I love you. Bye. Okay, let's do it. Thank God! Cecilia... One thing... Can I... May I touch it? Are you serious? - You're joking? - No, I'm not. But if it's mine and it's kicking - of course I wonder. I only see it on TV and in the papers. This is wrong - I shouldn't dance, I shouldn't sing. This is not for me. I... I quit. Maybe I should be calling the shots. Be the one who says, "You get to do this, but not you." But I would never say it in that way. Never! This Hollywood thing you're involved in... What do you see happening? "Queen Christina", Garbo. Do you know what Queen Christina looked like? She didn't look like Garbo, I'll tell you that. No, I'll be congratulating one of my colleagues at the party tonight. Of course I won't get the part. I did a lousy audition. My heart wasn't in it at all. You're paranoid. Would I be this persistent if I didn't know you're the best? You are the best. But you must, absolutely must stick to where your talent lies, not flit about in a hundred different directions. There you go, much better. - Are you upset? - I'm not upset at all. I'm just pissed off. You must see how hard I try. - This TV thing, it's a good thing. - No. - You just switch off. - Yes, I do. It's inane. Take any Miss Singer, she would have been better suited for it. Besides, you looked preposterous. That's a minor issue, but still. Look at yourself in that TV series you're making. This is why I'm doing it. Firstly, I'm not in all the episodes. Secondly, it's for children. Thirdly, I need the money. I can't go on acting all these parts. But I have to do it, in order to get work. I love my job, actually. I love it, it's wonderful! It's music. There's so much I couldn't explain. That you couldn't understand. That can't be described. Something that is - love. I don't quite know how to say this, but I want you to think about it. You don't have to decide now. I'm prepared to help you take care of the child. - That the two of us... - Oh, Rolf... I know, it sounds silly. Forget it. I only came to say... to see you and wish you luck. Darling, hello. You made me really happy when you phoned. Hi, girls! Did you go to the stable? Yes, but we couldn't ride. - Why not? - Daddy forgot to bring our helmets. Gregor, you forgot the helmets again? No. I haven't called anyone at TV4. Give me the phone. Alexandra Furustig speaking. Yes. That's great. They'll be over the moon. Yes, they're ready. Yes, they can make Thursday at 3 pm. I'll come with them. That's great. Thanks a lot. Guess what? "Starlets"! They're going to appear in "Starlets"! Put on your costumes so we can practise. I know, I know... I forgot to tell you about it, but don't ruin it for them. - They're going to be in "Starlets"? - They are. Is that what this "Gimme, Gimme" is all about? Do you seriously mean that we're to sit in the audience... - We know Björn and Benny. - Who doesn't? - Everybody knows Björn and Benny. - They think they do, but they don't. We've had dinner together! What is this nonsense? That's neither here nor there. The girls should get the chance, even if we are in the business. They shouldn't suffer just because you're a producer and I'm famous. I think it's great, so do the girls and I bet Björn and Benny do, too. Enough of this, I'm working tonight. I know who's the father of Cecilia's child. Right... - It's the American producer. - No, it can't be him. Why couldn't it be him? Have they been together? They left together on the day of the screen test. She's in a really tight corner, poor girl. Of course it's him. It's so embarrassing. Say what you like, I'm not playing tonight. Of course you're playing! Stella, please... Don't let that American film ruin your life. I'm sure you could get the part, but - "Christina", it's crap! - This has nothing to do with Christina. - Then what is it? It's one thing to fuck the director. It's another thing to fuck his wife. Karin? Christ... I thought she'd stopped having sex. I'm crazy about her. Do you think it's obvious that Stella is a lesbian? - Why do you ask? - Åke lost it today. - He felt there weren't any vibes. - Åke's always losing it. He felt no vibes because she's a lesbian. I don't think it shows, I think she's sexy. Don't you? - I'm not performing tonight. - Of course you are, it's sold out. The manager says Shakespeare sells, so let him play. It's you and Rebecca who are selling Shakespeare! And the weekends - I wake up at five because I'm working so hard. I just feel... This was the last straw, I just can't do it. Stella, I'll pick you up after the show and take you somewhere. - Take me where? - To a psychiatric clinic. - I can't go to a psychiatric clinic! - Course you can. You'll get help and pills, someone who'll take care of you. You won't believe who's in the first row! - I don't want to know, my nerves... - This is too much! I hate this theatre, I just have to get away. - I hate this. I can't do it. - Listen, we're going to do this. It's your birthday. Just think: "It's great to play on my birthday!" I met Cecilia today. God, she's got a belly, but no husband. I've got a husband but no children. And I'm so fed up with Shakespeare. You'll do a fantastic "Argentina", you're perfect for the part. But if you have doubts about me, then we have to... We have to come to some kind of decision, right? Or you have to. You're a brilliant director, with enormous intellectual ability and you posess substantial experience. However, musicals are not your genre. Perhaps they're not mine either, but with the right help it might work. You are not the right director for this musical. - Hi. - Hi, Tomas. How are you? How's the dancing? So-so. What's wrong? - Promise you won't say anything? - Of course not. - I'm pregnant. - Again? Who by? - Rebecca isn't around, is she? - No, she left. - Promise! Not a word? - Of course not. Christ, I can't even say it! It's too pathetic! It's Åke. Åke? - Åke Frigårdh? - What the hell should I do? - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. "Nothing"? I can tell something's wrong. What is it? Stop it, it's nothing. You haven't even said hello. Have I done something? - Stop it! - I won't go on stage. Tell me now. - We've got three hours out there. - Not now. Tell me what's up. I'm pregnant. I am pregnant. I've been to the doctor's today. - I'm pregnant, and you're the dad. - It can't be me. Ladies and gentlemen, Alexandra Furustig is... Grotesque! The honourable lady of the house, which is she? Speak to me, I shall answer for her. Your will? Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty. I would be loath to cast away my speech, for besides that it is well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Whence came you, sir? That question's out of my part. Now drink my health. Don't tell me you're shy, a big fellow like you? Fucking bastard! What the hell are you doing? Now you must kiss my shoe. Is't not well done? Excellently done, if God did all. 'Tis in grain, sir, 'twill endure wind and weather. 'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white nature's own hand laid on. If you'll lead these graces to the grave and leave the world no copy, then you are the cruell'st she alive. I will not be so hard-hearted. It shall be inventoried, and every particle and utensil labelled to my will as two lips... indifferent red; two grey eyes, with lids to them; one neck, one chin, and so forth. Orsino loves you. Such love could be but recompensed though you were crowned the nonpareil of beauty. How does he love me? With sighs of fire. - He knows I cannot love him. - If I did love you in my master's flame, with such a suff'ring, such a deadly life, in your denial I would find no sense. Why, what would you? Make me a willow cabin at your gate and call upon my soul within the house, write loyal cantons of contemnèd love, and sing them loud even in the dead of night. Halloo your name to the reverberate hills, and make the babbling gossip of the air cry out, 'Olivia!' Get you to Orsino, I cannot love him. Let him send no more, unless, perchance, you... ...come to me again to tell me how he takes it. Fare you well. I thank you for your pains. I am no fee'd post, lady. Keep your purse. Orsino, not myself, lacks recompense. Love make his heart of flint that you shall love, and let your fervour be placed in contempt. Farewell, fair cruelty. Are you serious, or jesting with me? I'm serious. Grotesque! I'll have another. No ice. Kiss my arse! What the hell is that? If you weren't mad when you arrived, this place will drive you nuts. - Relax and everything'll be fine. - Why's it taking so long? You'll be all right. You have to stay here. If they tell you to go, just say you're staying. Anyway, welcome and good luck. - Wait for me outside? - Sure. What's that? Those balls, are they there to calm me down if I get overexcited? Not excited, but you know... If you're stressed. Are they for calming you down? Yes, maybe. - Shall I talk, or you? - You go on. I don't know what to say. Congratulations! I'm so terribly happy for you, darling. No one else in the whole world could play the part as well as you. You're... Hi. Sorry I'm late. - What are you drinking? - Whisky. The same, please. What a bloody awful day. Listen, Magnus - considering the cost of this project I must ask you, why the hell did you wrap at three? You didn't do half of what you were supposed to do. There was this phone call. I'm a lesbian. I am. Yes, I am. - You're homosexual? - Yes, sometimes. - Sometimes, you say? - That is... I'm so in love with this woman. We spent last night together. She's married to... She's not gay, but she is married to the director of my film. Well, it's a bit... All I want, really... is to sleep, so I'll feel better. If I told you something in confidence, would it stay that way? Christ, you know it would! How long have we been friends? I'm going to be a father. That's nice... Forgive me for asking, but isn't Karin... Isn't she a bit old? And she's had... Yes, but it isn't Karin. Right. Who is it then? Listen, you mustn't tell a living soul. I promise. I don't want to intrude, but I've been watching you for a while. - Could I have your autograph? - Yes, sure. - Have you got a pen? - Yes. What's your name? - Liselotte Andersson. - "To"... "Hugs." "With hugs to Liselotte Andersson." Hugs to Liselotte? - I love everything you do. - That's nice to hear. - Have you seen everything? - Yes, I have. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Sorry. - No problem. Okay, who is it? Cecilia. - Cecilia? - Cecilia Falk. Oh my God! She started talking about it a long time ago, that she wanted a baby, but no father. - Do you understand? - Like Jesus. Then one night she asked me over, and then she told me... ...how she admired me as an actor and that I was such a warm person... - And attractive? - Right. So, I said yes. - You said you'd be a sperm donor? - Yes, sort of. Sort of? - You went to a hospital or a clinic? - We went into the bedroom. - The bedroom? - We did it, but only the once. Here's another cinematic genius. - What are you drinking? - Whisky. Stupid question. I'll have the same, please. Let me have a sip... - What a bloody awful day it's been! - You too? Forgive me for saying this, but your wife - don't mess with her...! Christ! It's about a quarter to eleven now. In Los Angeles it's... What's the time difference, eleven hours? - Los Angeles? - Yes, you see I... That's another thing! That could be why I'm like this today. They said that today they would phone about... You've read the papers? - "Queen Christina"? - They said they'd call today And... ...talk of Star Wars! - Has Georgina heard from America? - No, nothing. - Neither have I. - No, of course not. I hope she gets the part. No...? I saw her on TV this morning, with Pontare. She was wonderful. It shows her talent, and her courage. Right? One needs range these days. - She has that. - Yes, she has, and humour, too. And... Well, she's got courage. You've read the script? And you liked it? Great. You know, your wife and Erik make a wild couple on the screen. You should see the screen test. It's too much. It's... It's pure magic. They're so charismatic together. No problem making a romantic film with those two. The sensuality, you know... And the passion in their eyes... It's almost scary. It's amazing, and wonderful. Which scenes did you do for the screen test? It's a love story, I can't shoot them cleaning windows. A love scene, naturally. - What's up with you? - What do you mean? If I didn't know you better, I'd say you were jealous. It's a job. Talking of wives, I saw your ex on TV this morning. That was a real hit. - Did you see her? - No. I saw her. Flaunting her belly... To be honest, it made me feel pretty damn low. Where've you been? You were going to wait for me. - The psychiatric clinic. - Not again? - Kalle made me go. - I've called you lots of times! But I'm fine now. I'm fine! - How are you? - Oh, top form, you know... - How do I look? - Gorgeous. Have you been home? I had to cheer myself up before seeing this lot. - Shall we go in? - I was about to. I spent eight years nagging her about kids. I wanted kids. But it was never the right time for her. There was always some film or stage production in the way. And then she goes and gets pregnant by some bloody American producer! So much for Hollywood dreams! Instead of a part she got a kid. Shit... And to top it all, he's not standing by her. What's wrong with the guy? What kind of man gets a woman pregnant, and then doesn't take care of the kid? Seriously? Would you get a girl pregnant and then not give a shit about the kid? Dear Rebecca, dear colleagues... I just had the sudden realisation that the time in Los Angeles is about, say, mid-morning. This means that D-Day, or perhaps I should say Chr-Day, has just begun, over there. But we shouldn't let that dim our festivities, or overshadow the object of tonight's celebrations, namely, the forty-year-old actress. Tonight represented by Rebecca Olsson-Frigårdh. We are numerous. We are good-looking. We are talented. We can play queens and we can play witches. So, the parts may come and go, but an actress of forty is never de trop. And, I'm absolutely convinced that whoever is chosen to play Queen Christina... Whoever it may be, all the others will salute her with a heartfelt "Good luck!" Many happy returns, Rebecca. Åke! 7:30 am, sharp, in the studio tomorrow. - We were going to talk about the film. - During working hours. I've got to go home to the kids. See you, guys. - Two more of the same, please. - No... Oh yes, have one. I know that this is a party for... ...a woman, and where only women are invited. But I'm here, and I'm... ...dressed like this, because... Because I want to tell you, Rebecca, that I'm sorry about this morning. Also because I want to try to tell you, by doing this, I want to try to tell you... ...how... How much I love you. I have not forgotten your birthday, I've brought a little something with me. I won't disturb you any further, my ladies, I'm off to another party. Could we meet up this weekend? I'd like to talk to you. Just the two of us. - What's it about? - We'll talk then. - Why can't we talk here? - Too crowded, the walls have ears. Cheers! I'd just like to say something that feels... ...quite important to me, here, tonight. And that is, that to my mind, there is only one single person, at this table... ...who would be worthy of the part of Queen Christina. Good evening! I wonder if I could speak to Git Jeppson? Could we have a brief word, perhaps a bit more private than this? - Is this a birthday party? - Yes, it is. - Whose is it? - Rebecca. Many happy returns! - Could we have just five minutes? - Okay. - Don't you want a glass of wine? - I'm off to America tomorrow. It's the producer, she's got the part. To Git! She's got the part! Seriously, she's the only one who actually looks like Garbo. That wasn't the point. They didn't want a look-alike, did they? They were looking for something within! If you were free... The trouble is we start in a month's time. I'm going back to Britain tonight. Is there any chance? It's no problem. Michael Pollak, you are rescuing me. Thank you very, very much. - Now what? - Did you get the part? You got the part? - For real? - Only joking! What happened? I'm going to play the queen... of Scots. - Cut it out! - What's she saying? It's the kids. - How did he find you? - He saw my film. "Between Wars". He saw the film that no one else saw, and now he wants me! I'm so damned relieved it wasn't Christina! This is unreal! Tell us! That was Hollywood, wasn't it? Madonna's going to play Queen Christina! - What? - For real? Hang on. Right, I'm on my way. That was Cecilia. Her waters have broken. She wants me there. Have you got 500 kronor? I need it for a taxi. 500 kronor! Thanks. To be perfectly honest, I don't give a damn who the father of this kid is. - Can I talk to you? - I'm in a hurry. Reception will be happy to help you. Have you got a cigarette? - Can I buy you a drink? - I'd love that. - What do you fancy? - Gin and tonic, please. All right if I sit here? So you finally showed up... You've got a beautiful little daughter. Cecilia's going to call her Nellie, no matter what you think. - Do you want to hold her? - May I? I'll go tell Cecilia you're here. - Will you be fine for five minutes? - I'll sit down. Well done! It's mine. So you're just visiting Stockholm? Over the weekend, then I'll go back home. Do you work in Dalarna? - What do you do? - I'm a nursery assistant. Husband, children... - Me too. - Husband and children? - No, a wife and children. - Right. Here's to our families. It doesn't matter who's behind this, I'm going to take care of you. Welcome to your life. I thank Almighty God that I was born of royal stock... ...and raised to be the Queen of so large and mighty a kingdom. Subtitle Preparing for DVD: Satellittext AB / Stockholm
