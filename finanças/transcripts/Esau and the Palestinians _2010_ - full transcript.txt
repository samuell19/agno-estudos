this is the orient house located here in the eastern section of the city of Jerusalem it's a center of controversy between the Israelis and the Palestinians the late Faisal Hussein he was headquartered here as the representative for the Palestinian Liberation Organization in Jerusalem and it has been somewhat of a capital for the proposed Palestinian state with Jerusalem as the capital city what it actually does for us it emphasizes the conflict between two brothers Jacob and Esau the Israelis and the Palestinians a conflict has been going on now for some four thousand years it dates back to the time of Abraham his son Isaac and then the twin sons of Isaac Jacob and Esau the Bible tells us in the twenty-fifth chapter of the book of Genesis that God told Rebecca the mother of these two boys they would each become a nation Jacob we know would become the nation of Israel but what about he saw what nation did he become he saw was put out of the promised land 36 chapter of the book of Genesis God directed him to the southern portion of modern-day Jordan to a place called Mount Seir and he headquartered in a city called Petra will be visiting Petra and just a little bit later on in this video five hundred years before the birth of Jesus Christ the Nabataeans they were the famous stone carvers from over in Arabia had befriended the Edomites but then they turned against the Edomites killing many of the Edomites there in this impregnable city called Petra some xscape made a westward turn going over into southern Judah and they became the IDA Millions at that point in time their capital their nation had been devastated this was a prophecy given by the last prophet in the Old Testament Malachi in the book of Malachi chapter one God had told both of these brothers are their descendants at that time in history that he loved Jacob and he hated Esau now that's not an emotional experience that was going on in the heart of God this was his sufferance election God as he had with the sons of Abraham selected the second born the younger of the two to have the responsibility of receiving not only the birthright but the blessing from his father Abraham replacing Ishmael the firstborn now in the case of Jacob and Esau Esau the firstborn howbeit just simply by a body link even we remember Jacob had his hand on the heel of his twin brother Esau but Jacob was the second born he saw the firstborn he was to receive the birthright in the blessing God sovereignly selected the younger over the elder for his purposes in the future and then he devastated Esau and his nation there in the area that his known today as modern-day Jordan the lower third Edom there at Petra but Esau said I will return I will rebuild God said I will call your borders the borders of wickedness and I will have indignation against you forever it's the story of two brothers we'd like to continue to tell that story as we travel through the land and show you from God's Word God's plan from both of these brothers come travel with me if you will to their hometown near Bear Sheva here on the windswept slopes of this little mound here in the desert area just outside of Bear Sheva modern-day city of bear Sheva and very close to biblical bear Sheva which was the hometown of Abraham some 4000 years ago it was here that he raised his son Isaac and then Isaac would raise his two twin sons he saw Jacob remains of a ancient well here in bear Sheva brings back many many thoughts about how they would have watered their cattle watered their their fields here at Bear Sheva we have to go back these 4,000 years to continue the story of two boys the sons of well the sons of Isaac and Rebekah which are talked about right here in the twenty-fifth chapter of the book of Genesis this is the record of how they came to this earth to live out their lives and to establish two nations it would basically be fighting each other throughout all the generations the 25th chapter of the book of Genesis starting in verse 19 it talks about the generations of Abraham's son Isaac and Isaac at 40 years of age took a wife her name was Rebecca she was from Syria she was a lady who was barren interestingly so was the womb of Isaac's mother Sarah and God opened that wounding gave Abraham the son of promise Isaac and now Isaac goes to the Lord and and starts praying for his wife's womb to be open well the Lord opened Rebecca's woman sometimes I I mentioned that maybe you got to watch how you pray because his Isaac prayed he prayed for a son that could carry on his heritage and stayed God gave him two sons twin boys most likely the first record in the Bible of twins being born the first born was Esau the second born Jacob howbeit he was less than a body leak second holding on to his brothers heel as he came forth actually before they were ever born they started to struggle they started to fight even in the womb with their mother the Bible tells us here in the twenty-fifth chapter of Genesis verse 22 and the children struggled together within her and she said why is this so so she went to the Lord to find out why this was going on very important verse here's verse 23 where the Lord answers the prayer the request for knowledge by Rebecca but also gives a prophecy the Lord says and the Lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb a two manner of people shall be separated from by bowels and they are people that will have confrontation with the elder serving the younger we know that tradition at the time was that the firstborn was to receive not only the birthright but the blessing from his father at the end of his father's life to carry on the heritage the Bible records the story of how the birthright was lost by the firstborn Esau to his supposedly conniving brother Jacob here in the 27th verse of the twenty-fifth chapter of Genesis and the boys grew and he saw was a cunning hunter a man to the field Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of the venison Rebekah the mother of the two boys loved the son Jacob and Jacob he prepared the pottage he saw the pottage him one day he had prepared a wonderful meal he was out of the feeling confronted by his brother Esau who was quite hungry Esau said give me some of that lunch that you've prepared there Jacob well Jacob knew exactly what he was doing ultimately he ended up making a deal with he saw that he would give him all of the me if he would then trade for that meal his birthright it's supposedly conniving and I say that supposedly conniving because the Bible that already said that God had said the elder would serve the younger and so the elder would lose the birthright this sovereign selection would begin right here choosing the second-born over the firstborn same thing happened in the 27th chapter of the book of Genesis there we see that Isaac just at the point of death almost blind not able to really tell who was even in the room with him but call for his son Esau to go into the field find a deer kill it and prepare some venison stew for him and as they came together for the meal and then Isaac would pronounce the blessing over his firstborn he saw Rebecca heard about this and she immediately as Esau took off across the fields looking someplace for a deer to prepare the venison stew and she went to Jacob which is I've got an idea we can get not only the birthright we can get the blessing from your father Isaac as well Esau is gone to the field will dress you up as Esau put on some of his clothing and we'll get some animal skin that's hairy and put it on your arm because my brother's very hairy your father's not gonna be able to see I've got two venison stew that I prepared I thought he saw how to prepare the soup you can take it in and you can pretend that you're Esau and receive the blessing from your father that's exactly what the text tells us in the 27th chapter of the book of Genesis well Jacob had just left having received the blessing from his father Isaac and in walks he saw Abba Hebrew for daddy Abba I'm here to receive the blessing I've prepared the venison stew Isaac all of a sudden and wait a minute I have just given the I thought that was he saw that was a Jew that I just gave the blessing to must have been your conniving brother Jacob and again that thought of a a brother who manipulated who can I to get not only the first right with the blessing but God had promised that indeed the elder would serve the younger well Isaac having giving the blessing had no blessing to give to Esau but he saw wanted a blessing in fact it says he lifted up his voice and and cried demanding that he receive a blessing the Bible tells us that he saw after Jacob had given the blessing to his younger brother then he saw what hate Jacob because of that their mother Rebecca said that Jacob had better leave the land and so he would go north into Iran which is modern-day Turkey and there live with her brother for a period of years before he would come back into the land well as we move through the account of Esau and Jacob moving further into the book of Genesis we come to the 36th chapter now of the book of Genesis Jacob has made his way back south here into Canaan into the land of Israel his brother Esau had somewhat come to an understanding of what had taken place and so they were coexisting in this land both of them were very very prosperous God then because of their prosperity was going to have to divide them both of them could not live in this land in fact in chapter 36 and verse 7 it says for their riches were more than that they might dwell together in this land where and they were strangers and it could not bear them because of all of their cattle over the 37th chapter verse 1 Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger in the land of Canaan so God was here through sovereign selection giving the land to the younger brother the second born sovereignly selecting the second born over the firstborn he's now going to have Esau leave the land of Canaan the land of promise and go to Mount Seir in verse 8 thus 12th esau in Mount Seir Esau is Edom we'll find out in just a few moments as I continue to tell this story of Esau and the Palestinians that Esau is going to take his family and moved south east of the area of the Dead see into what at that time was referred to as Mount Seir today it's modern-day Jordan in biblical times it was the lower third of Jordan and known as Edom almond Moab and Edom take a map of biblical lands and look at the Dead Sea and go east from the south of the Dead Sea all the way to the Red Sea you're talking about the land of Edom Mount Seir and to a location that he saw would go and establish his capital in a place called Petra will be visiting there in just a few months but before we make that journey let me tell you something of great interest here in the 12th verse of chapter 36 we find out who Esau's grandson was and Timna was a concubine to Elif as Esau's son and she bared to Elif as Amalek and these are the sons of ada esau's wife so the grandson of Esau the son of eliphaz was Emelec could become the father of the Amalekites now this story needs to be continued on a mountainous range where Moses would one day as he was leading the children of Israel through the promised land be confronted by the Amalekites he would be victorious he would have the opportunity to kill most of the Amalekites who had become his enemy but not all and that line from Esau who Amalek all the way down to today would continue on that story will be continued in another location right now here on this windswept little mountain on the fields of bear Sheva my thoughts are on Esau and Jacob two twin brothers text telling us these boys would one day grow up and their families their heritage would become two nations you would have confrontation between them about all you it was almost 4000 years ago when God directed Esau and his descendants to leave the land of Canaan and go to Mount Seir Mount Seir the lower third of modern-day Jordan would later be renamed Edom after the descendants of Esau God would allow Jacob and his descendants to remain in the land of Canaan which is modern-day Israel then 3,500 years ago after 400 years plus of the Jewish people being in the Egyptian bondage God would raise up Moses to lead the children of Israel towards the promised land now they would be wandering for 40 years in the wilderness and in that first year of their wandering they would come to a location called Rafa deem in the 17th chapter of the book of Exodus we see the account of the children of Israel being confronted by the Amalekites the descendants of emilich Esau's grandson it was there in the valley below that the children of Israel the Israelites would be confronted by the Amalekites the Amalekites wanted to destroy the Jewish people but God had another plan God would allow Moses to be on the mountain peak along with Aaron and Hur and their God would give Moses the capability of holding the rod of God above his head as long as he was able to keep it above his head the Israelites would win the battle in the valley below when he would grow weary and drop his arms down and then the Amalekites would start to be victorious over the Israelites God would then give streak to Moses he would lift his arms the rod above his head and the Israelites would again start to win the battle finally Moses grew so weary that Aaron and her would hold his arms up the Israelites were victorious not all of the Amalekites were killed some of them would escape in this 17th chapter of Exodus God directs Moses to write this down for a memorial first time any place in the Bible where somebody was told to write something down the Lord said unto Moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the years of Joshua Joshua of course the first lieutenant for Moses who had actually take the children of Israel into the Promised Land very interesting phrase in the 16th verse here the Lord says that he will have war with emilich from generation to generation as we continue the story of two brothers three thousand years ago in the site just outside of Jerusalem Gibeah the site of the palace of the first king of Israel King saw that which was written in the book the event that took place at refa deem when the Edomites tried to destroy the Israelites it would be remembered in the mind of God and God would instruct the prophet Samuel to give King saw the responsibility of wiping out killing all the Amalekites we need to go from here to give you to continue this story this is Mount Gibeah located here at the edge of the Judean wilderness just outside the city of Jerusalem behind me the Jordan Valley the Jordan River the mountains across the Jordan River the country of Jordan modern-day Jordan location of Mount Seir in the days of Esau that's where God directed he's on his descendants to go to live but the story of the two brothers continues here mister the remains of a palace that the lake King Hussein of Jordan was building just prior to the six-day war in 1967 it's also the site of the palace of the first king of Israel King Saul and Samuel the Prophet would come here to continue the unfolding of this story of the two brothers the unfinished palace of one king the late King Hussein of Jordan and the actual historic site of a palace of another King King Saul the first king of Israel as we continue our story of the two brothers it takes us to the book of 1st Samuel that's the book in the Bible that records all the activities of this first king of Israel King Saul and as we come to chapter 15 we see that those things written in that book back in Exodus chapter 17 would be rehearsed before King Saul in chapter 15 and verse 1 Samuel said to Saul the Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people over all of Israel right here in this location now therefore hearken unto the voice of the words of the Lord here's another message that God has from Samuel the Prophet to King Saul thus saith the Lord of Hosts I remember that which Amalek did to Israel how he laid wait for him in the way when they came up from Egypt of course that is recorded in the 70 chapter of Exodus and the incident that took place there - rough Adeem verse three now go and smite Amalek the grandson of Esau and the father of the Amalekites go and smite Emelec and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both the men and the women the infant and the suckling the ox and the sheep the camel and the ass God gave a directive to the prophet Samuel to tell King Saul kill all of the Amalekites all of their possessions and interestingly at this particular site here in Israel the command would not be kept after several days the prophet Samuel returned to King Saul to see if he had been following the direction that had come from God through him the Prophet - the King Samuel asked King Saul have you killed the Amalekites he assured him he had what about the animals of the Amalekites and as he was even speaking but Samuel said to King Saul what was that I'm not sure now let me ask you again you killed all of the Amalekites yes I did you killed all of their animals I serve bad and again the sound Samuel said to King Saul sounds like the voice the sound of a sheep to me he said oh that's right I kept some of the sheep because they were pure perfect without blemish without spot I thought that we could offer them in sacrifice very interesting statement made by the prophet Samuel he said it's better to be obedient than to offer sacrifice and then the prophet Samuel asked King Saul did you kill a gag the king of the Amalekites no I didn't why not we could use his riches to to further our nation the nation of Israel now Samuel is very much disturbed with the disobedience of King Saul so he tells him to brain a gag to you a gag the king of the Amalekites stands there in front of him the Bible tells us after 15 of the book of 1st Samuel and in verse 33 and Samuel said to a gag the king of the Amalekites as thy sword hath made women childless so shall thy mother be childless among women and Samuel hewed a gag in two pieces before the Lord God told Samuel to deliver the message to King Saul kill all of the Amalekites and Israeli general today not too long ago was talking with me and he told me the problem even in present-day Israel is because of the failure of King Saul to follow the command from God to kill all of the Amalekites today Israelis continually confronted in conflict with the Amalekites well this is not the end of the story of the two brothers some of these Amalekites escaped from here in libya there made their way into Persia we'll tell you more about that in just a few moments I was just remembering a story that my son Jimmy told me as I looked at this the unfinished palace of the lake King Hussein in 1994 when they had decided to sign a peace treaty with Israel the Israelis allowed the Jordanians to have their King King Hussein who piloted his own 747 fly across the airspace of Israel in fact he flew over this unfinished Palace Jimmy and a good friend Manoah calles year were out on the patio watching as the plane came down low so the king could see the palace in fact jimmy told me he even saw the king at the cockpit of that big 747 well it was a palace where I take you for the next chapter in the story of the two brothers was a palace where King has arranged he was the fourth of the Persian kings and the richest of all the Persian kings less far he was married to Vashti you might remember the story as recorded in the book of Esther King has arrived the throne Queen Vashti and then had his court brain before him candidates to become queen he selected one named Esther unbeknownst to him she was a Jewess and she had a cousin whose name was what a ki one day Haman the number two in the land the villain actually of the book of Esther came walking through the gate as he did everybody bowed except one person the cousin to the Queen what a ki Haman turned around and said to morning hey you didn't bow to me what okay I said I'm not gonna bow to you I don't bow to anybody except God well this very much disturbed Haman he went into the palace he met with the King king of header I see said you know how we had to deal with Queen Vashti I think we're gonna have to deal with these Jews now there's one outside not respecting leadership he did not bow to me as I entered the city of course King then look to his second-in-command what should we do Haman said I think we should kill all of the Jews you write down the law of the Medes and the Persians I will carry that law out and we will kill all of the Jews of course if you remember the book of Esther for such a time of this as this Queen Esther had come into the kingdom and she would of course save the Jewish people I told you that story only to bring you to a verse in chapter 3 of the book of Esther here's what it says after these things did King has arrived emot-- Haman the son of AB Edessa the aggragate the akka gate he was a descendant of a gag the king of the Amalekites in 1st Samuel chapter 15 the Amalekites well they were all descendants of Amalek the grandson of Esau 36 chapter of the book of Genesis do you see the progression Esau Amalek his grandson Agag the king of the Amalekites Haman a descendant of a gag oh by the way Haman had a great great-great-great-great grandson as well his name Herod the Great all descendants of Esau the blessing that Isaac gave to Esau you will live by the sword you will kill your brother the story of two brothers conflict down through every generation now through God's sovereign selection he chooses Jacob and gives him the land of Canaan modern-day Israel the second-born receives that which was supposedly granted to the firstborn and that sovereign selection then affects the life of Esau who becomes Edom he is sent from the land of Canaan here into what is southern Jordan today it's referred to in the Bible as Mount Seir verse 8 says thus dwelt Esau in mouths ear Esau is Edom behind me Petra the mountains of Petra the location that Esau would select as the capital of his geographical location his nation the Edomites will go into Petra in just a few moments we'll see why he saw would have selected this impregnable city it was a very secure City the king's highway would come by it he would use that then as a way to rob the merchants making their way on to Mecca and over him to the Persian Gulf come with me now let's go to the entrance of Petra here in Edom this would be a portion of the Kings Highway that would make its way right here in front of the seek that leads into Petra seek an Arabic word which means high narrow Gorge will take you through the seek in just a moment and explain why this was such an impregnable City but it was stupid tree here in Edom at the time referred to as Mount Seir the lower third of modern-day Jordan where God would sovereignly select Esau to move to this portion of the middle east leaving jacob over in canaan are what we know today as modern-day Israel here in the 37th chapter of the book of Genesis we see that God said in Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger in the land of Canaan sovereign selection goes into play as God selects the younger son over the elder son the one who was to have received the birthright and the blessing from his father to pass on the heritage to the next generations chapter 36 explains to us that God now takes the eldest son and he moves him out of the promised land here into Mount Seir and the headquarter here in Petra will talk about the reason for having this as their base their capital city in just a few moments as we walk through the seek the reason and one of the physical reasons that God divided these two brothers was because of their riches it says here in the 36 chapter of the book of Genesis for their riches were more than that they might dwell together and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle both had become so prosperous and God had to divide them this part is all of his plan his sovereign selection of the second born over the first born verse 8 thus dwelt Esau in Mount Seir Esau is Edom he selects Petra here in the lower third of modern-day Jordan known in biblical times as Edom he selects this particular geographical location for the descendants of Esau to headquarter in during biblical times it was long this king's highway that Moses would have traveled with the children of Israel making his way from the Egyptian bondage over and crossing their Jordan in Jericho but because of the Edomites antagonism against the Jewish people and the children of Israel Moses was confronted by the Edomites here told that he could not come this way Moses quickly said well if my cattle drink your water eat your grass I'll pay for it you might refused to allow the children of Israel being led by Moses to go on towards Jericho and the promised instead they had to make their way south and then all the way over near Arabia coming across the desert land into shittim there where they encamped before they crossed over the Jordan River into the Promised Land but as I said they selected this particular location because it was an impregnable city I think to be able to understand that we need to walk through the sea can walk into this 22 square mile unique city of Petra come along with me as we walk through the seek and I'll explain more as we travel when Esau came here to live in the Mount Seir mountain range he understood that he had to protect his family and so they would select a location that would do exactly that and he comes here to Petra he discovers this location and I told you that it was an impregnable City as we approach the seek here and our journey on into the city we realized that well you can see it's a location where just a small group of men might be able to protect themselves from any military force that would be coming this way and from here they could make their way out of the seek rob the merchants back into the sea can just place several men here at the entrance to stop anybody from coming into the seek an impregnable city you need to see the city of Petra V capital for the Edomites about four thousand years ago come along with me you can just tell how narrow it's gonna get probably about 50 feet down the way as we make our journey through the seek here at Petra and then you're also able to see the height of the the walls that protect this city at some locations and as we travel you'll be able to see as I'm making my walk along three to five hundred feet maybe sometimes 600 feet if indeed the several Edomites that would be standing here to protect their city or over run then as the enemy would continue on through the seek into the city the men with the pots of boiling water could pour it on top of them stopping them from entering into this their capital here in Edom come along as we make our way and let me just pause here for a moment these are the remains of an aqueduct water system by which the Edomites would be able to survive they needed the water this is one way that they would bring the water in from outside come along here's an example of how they're the Seekers I mean my arm span is about seven feet maybe it extends out to 1012 feet here and then looking down you can see very very narrow the way of protection is seek dramatic as you stop at this spot right here on the way inside the city of Petra to see how protected the city really is in addition to that beautiful as we journey you you caught me I've taken a little bit of a rest we're about halfway through the seek into the city of Petra with a place of refreshment a little oasis right here in the seek reminding you that the book of Revelation in chapter 12 and verse 6 God says to the Jewish people I will prepare a place to protect you during the terrible time of tribulation and as we make our way on into Petra you will understand that this fits all the requirements the description by Jesus Christ for example he says in Matthew chapter 24 that when the abomination of desolation takes place that's when the Antichrist walks into the temple in Jerusalem goes into the Holy of Holies and there he sits down and claims to be God second Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 4 the abomination of desolation takes place in Jesus reminding the Jewish people of the prophecy from Daniel he said when you see that happening flee for the mountains well we were here in the mountains it says in Revelation chapter 12 go to the wilderness and indeed we are in the wilderness is a place prepared by God to protect the Jewish people for the three and a half years Zechariah chapter thirteen verse eight says two out of every three Jews will be killed but the remaining four million protected here now I know that it's an open sky and a helicopter could come in and and devastate anybody by dropping a bomb into the city and as we get into the city you'll see how that is much more of a possibility but as God provided for the Jewish people as they wandered in the wilderness so he will during that last three and a half years the time of Jacob's trouble and here in the city of Petra they will be protected until Jesus Christ comes here to take them on to Jerusalem and begin his millennial reign his Millennial Kingdom let's go in and see the city well we've almost made our way through the Milan a third down the seek and into the entrance of the city of Petra as I move across this narrow Gorge you can see through the height of the narrow Gorge the remains of the Treasury Building was carved out of a sandstone by the Nabataeans almost 500 years ago you'll be able to understand why people would choose this location to headquarter their military might the Edomites headquarter in here in the city of Petra about five hundred years before the birth of Jesus Christ the Nabataeans who would have befriended the Edomites would be invited to a banquet here in Petra they'd make their way through the seek which was protecting of course this city the capital for the Edomites and they would come into the city now behind me is the Treasury one of the examples of the stone carving capabilities this is five stories high and Nabataeans wood carved from top to bottom extending their ropes over the edge of the cliff there and then start to carve out this beautiful edifice here the Treasury in the city of Petra until they completed it as we make our way on through Petra we'll see many examples coming let's look at other examples in addition to the Treasury Building that the Nabataeans would have carved out of the sandstone at the entrance of the city of Petra about five hundred years before the birth of Jesus Christ they would have taken to the cliffs here in Petra and carved out the individual homes the burial sites the temples right here in the stone on the cliffs of Petra just down the path and we'll make our way there the Colosseum carved by the Nabataeans many years ago the Colosseum here in the city of Petra as I pointed out to you from our other vantage point another example of the talented stone carving done by the Nabateans here in this city where they had developed a relationship with the Edomites this Colosseum probably could seat between five and seven thousand people with the burial sites the homes the temples the Colosseum the treasury building examples of the stone carving of the Nabateans I've had my cameraman focus on one of the caves there the clefts of the rock there are many other caves that you see on the cliffs in the city of Petra and the Lord referred to that when he inspired Obadiah to write to the Edomites and the reasons that he was going to destroy them one of the reasons would be in the book of Obadiah verse 10 for the violence against their brother Jacob in other words the killing of the Jews but a second reason was because of their pride the Bible tells us here in the third verse of Obadiah the pride of thy heart hath deceived thee thou that dwellest in the cleft of the rock whose habitation is high that saith in his heart who shall bring me down to the ground you can see on the cliffs of the rock they could perch there in fact it even talks about the fact that they may be exalting themselves as the eagle and though they set their nest among the stars thit's will I bring thee down saith the Lord the book of the moment daya a prophecy saying that the Edomites the Palestinians of today would be defeated God would bring them down because of their pride because of their violence against the Jewish people these columns may well have been standing here at the time of the banquet as recorded in the book of Obadiah it was a banquet where the Edomites had invited their friends the Nabataeans the famous stone carvers here in Petra to come in and have a time with them the Prophet Obadiah received a prophecy 300 years before the fact of how the Edomites would be destroyed devastated here in their city their capital city of protection in the little book of Obadiah verse 7 it says this and all the men of thy Confederacy that brought thee even to the border the men that were at peace with thee had deceived thee and prevailed against thee they that eath I bred have laid a womb under thee liberty ins at the banquet table would take their swords starting to kill the Edomites trying to destroy them and take over this wilderness fortress some of the Edomites would make their way running quickly through the seek and then turn westward across the Jordan Valley over into southern Judah and become the item Ian's their mountain wilderness stronghold their fortress had been devastated they'd lost their capital in Edom and I would become a different people in the land and walk him here on the street that dates back 2,000 years ago to the time of Jesus Christ located here in the old city of Jerusalem to try to Jason to the Western Wall the Western retaining wall that Herod the Great would have built he was new to me and you might remember a descendant of Esau you see the remains of the markets and then this street would have continued underneath Robinson's arch remains of which there only Western retaining wall these stones they date back to the Roman invasion of Jerusalem in 70 AD one of the reasons that Herod was known as Herod the Great was because he was a great builder as evidenced by this retaining wall the western retaining wall of the Temple Mount he also refurbished the temple the Jewish temple just on the other side of this retaining wall Herod used 10,000 men over a number of years to build this edifice the rabbi's said if you had never seen Herod's temple and the complex you had never seen a beautiful building as I said Herod was an e de Mian he was a descendant of Esau and in 70 AD this wall the remains of which we see some up here behind me in the pile of stones these Western walled retaining wall stones this wall was destroyed by the Roman army the temple was devastated the city was destroyed and the Jews were dispersed to the four corners of the earth and was found in prophecy in response to a question that the disciples asked Jesus Christ during the elevat-- discourse he walked from the temple and he said there not be a stone standing upon a stone that very much puzzled the disciples they understood all the labor that had gone into building not only the temple but this retaining wall but then jesus said in a record of that Olivet discourse Luke chapter 21 and verse 2 before and they shall fall by the sword the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled Jesus was referring to 70 AD and the prophecy that he made not a stone upon a stone on the Temple Mount would be found was fulfilled in 70 AD the Jews were joined by their cousins actually by brothers the descendants of Esau the descendants of Jacob coming together to fight the Romans they both lost the Jews were dispersed to the four corners of the earth as the book of Deuteronomy said they would be the descendants of Esau well they were dispersed to the Balkans to a place called Bosnia the Jews would return to the land and so would the Edomites we continue our story of the two brothers as we talk about what happened as these two peoples would return from around the world here to the land of promise the land of issue and I would jump ahead almost 2,000 years to 1917 the Edomites descendants of Esau assisted the Jewish people when they fought the Romans in 70 AD before the city was devastated that temple destroyed and the Jews dispersed to the four corners of the earth as I mentioned the Edomites the descendants of Esau were dispersed to the Balkans and into a place called Bosnia I've just come out of the Jaffa Gate it's a very interesting story that unfolds here as I continued the story of the two brothers in 1917 the Brits were fighting the Turks in the Jezreel Valley general Allenby the commanding officer of the British forces defeated the mighty Turkish army in the Jezreel Valley which marked the beginning of the end for the Ottoman Empire general Allenby came then here to Jerusalem did a mopping up exercise he got word that the Turks were ready to surrender they were going to surrender here at the Tower of David just inside the jaffa gate general Allenby mounted his white horse road to the Jaffa Gate and as he approached the Jaffa Gate he dismounted his military aide said sir are you not going into the ceremony the Turks are ready to surrender to the British Empire they said I'm going in but I'm not gonna ride my white horse it the general as I understand it according to his nephew on the 75th anniversary of this particular incident related to me that general Allenby said to his military aide no I'll not ride my white horse in today one day my Saviour Jesus Christ will ride a white horse into this city I'll tell you the remaining parts of this story inside of the Tower of David it's normally pretty crowded and noisy right here at the entrance of the old city through the Jaffa Gate and as general Allenby entered the old city that day coming here to the entrance of the Tower of David to receive the surrender from the Ottoman Empire wasn't it's noisy maybe not quite as much traffic but the crowds were throng this little square I remember being told by the late daughter the youngest daughter of Horatio Spafford was a missionary here in Jerusalem at that time 1917 and his family would have been seated there on the balcony of the hotel witnessing this historic event it was December the 9th 1917 general Allenby enters the jaffa gate dismounting from his horse walking in here to the entrance of the Tower of David and right here on this spot he would stand and receive the surrender from the leaders of the Ottoman Empire the Ottoman Empire the Turks who had controlled the Middle East for four hundred years now the British Empire would take control of the Middle East actually it was the beginning of the redemption for the Jewish people well that's another story the story of the two brothers though had as an effect of this particular event that took place here at the Tower of David a continuation of it's a story that day after receiving the surrender general Allenby realized he needed to name a mayor for the city of Jerusalem he looked and found the highest-ranking Muslim cleric in the community his name was Hussein al husseiny and he named that day Hussein al husseiny as the mayor of Jerusalem as he started to depart he he noticed a little boy holding on to the shirt sleeve of Hussain al husseiny caught his attention very cute little boy there you have no he said that's my nephew oh what's his name Aman Al Hussein he's 11 years old what a cute young nephew that you have well general Allenby departed left the surrender ceremony the British Empire took over and a Mon L Hussein he grew up it's now 1935 Aman L Hussein he has made a pilgrimage to Mecca he becomes the Haj Amin al-husseini and then he comes here to Jerusalem and is declared the mufti of Jerusalem the highest-ranking Muslim in the Middle East in the early 40s he received a communication from Adolf Hitler in Berlin Adolf Hitler sent the message if you want to know how to exterminate the Jewish people come to Berlin and we'll work together the Haj Amin al husseiny made his way to Berlin Hitler had built the largest most powerful radio station in the world on the coast of the Mediterranean in Minako 1 million watts of power Hitler told Haj Amin al-husseini the mufti of Jerusalem the highest-ranking Moslem in the entire Middle East that all he needed to do was go on that powerful radio station and call for all the Muslims of the world to rise up for the honor of Allah and kill the Jewish people and then Hitler told Haj Amin al-husseini you need to go to Bosnia to gather in your descendants remember the Edomites were dispersed to Bosnia Adolf Hitler had been using the elite commando unit from Bosnia at the apex of his blitzkrieg the blitzkrieg he would form his army into a V and it right at the apex of that V he would put this elite commando unit from Bosnia and that's the way they would take over the countries throughout all of Europe during World War Two the Haj Amin al-husseini has depicted and some of the documentation at the Holocaust Museum did go to Bosnia he inspected this elite commando unit and then he brought them right here into Israel it's now 1948 and that latrone the site today of the tank museum but in 1948 the site of a major battle in the war of independence as the jewish people worked to establish their state among the states of all the nations of the world right here in the middle east behind the tank museum here at Latrun is the valley of i alone it was a location where the children of israel under the leadership of Joshua would have fought those who did not want the Israelites to enter the promised land in 1948 it was the scene of a major battle a dear friend of mine Kailash ear told me of the battle in that field behind Latrun you see Latrun at the time of the war of independence was an arab police station an arab military site to keep the jewish people from getting up to jerusalem actually that entire fill had been mined and and Speke crawled on his hands and knees to defuse all of those mines they had to gain this particular spot in order to be able to come from tel-aviv and make their way to jerusalem he told me in a conversation that we want had the fierce fighting force of the Bosnians the elite commando unit which Adolf Hitler had used in his blitzkrieg when he would take over the nations of Europe they joined with the Muslims of the world right here at this location to try and destroy the nation of Israel an elite commando unit from Bosnia Bosnia the location that the Edomites the descendants of Esau went when they were dispersed in 70 AD from the land of Israel in the city of Jerusalem and by the way I was talking to you about the mufti of Jerusalem the Haj Amin al-husseini he was the nephew remember of Hussein al husseiny the man that general Allenby appointed the first mayor of Jerusalem the Haj Amin al-husseini had a nephew as well and his name Yasser Arafat in the line from Esau down through the years to Amalek agag Haman Herod the Great Hussein al husseiny the Haj Amin al-husseini Yasser Arafat and now machmood a bus the chairman of the Palestinian Authority who promised when he was sworn in as the chairman of the Palestinian Authority he would carry forth his leader Yasser Arafat's policies in the future to endeavor to destroy the Jewish people removing them from the Land of Israel and the story of the two brothers continues we come to the conclusion of our story of the two brothers Jacob and Esau by referring to the book of Obadiah the smallest book in the Old Testament a prophecy given to the Prophet Obadiah some 2,800 years ago the first 14 verses of Obadiah are history actually prophecy that has been fulfilled coming to verse 15 we read for the day of the Lord is near upon all of the heathen in other words upon the Gentiles as thou hast done it shall be done unto thee thy reward shall return unto thine own head the day of the Lord is a phrase used 72 times in the Bible its definition any time in history when God intercedes in the affairs of Man personally on the earth it's practical application is referring to the time that Jesus Christ the Messiah will come back here to the earth seated here on the Mount of Olives Kidron Valley behind me and then where the Dome of the rock in the eastern gate are that would be the old city of the Temple Mount where Jesus Christ will rule in reign and so he's referring to that time when Jesus will come back to this spot go across the Kidron Valley into his temple in verse 64 as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain that's phrase used 18 times in the Bible is referring to the Temple Mount the holy mountain of God what does it mean you have drunk upon my holy mountain it doesn't mean that they took a fifth of liquor and guzzle it down it's referring to what Zechariah the Prophet said in Sakurai chapter 12 and verse 2 he says Jerusalem in the last days will become a cup of trembling that means as it goes back into the Book of Proverbs when you have the cup full of the juice of the vine and and the juice starts to move it's intoxicating so in the end times Jerusalem shall become intoxicating those that control it intoxicated with power here in Obadiah he's talking to the Edomites to the present-day Palestinians you are intoxicated with power I can remember when at one time as a journalist I was serving in Jerusalem President Bill Clinton came to the city I was standing near the president and the mayor of Jerusalem then a hoot Oh March Bill Clinton said he'd like to go to the old city onto the Temple Mount the mayor said he would be happy to be his personal guide when yasser arafat heard about that he went livid and he put men armed men with their rifles with their your nades to stop anybody from coming in one of those seven gates leading up onto the Temple Mount here it was a backwater terrorists Yasser Arafat stopping the most powerful man in the world the President of the United States from entering that spot the San verse 16 you have drunk upon my holy mountain you are intoxicated with power upon my holy mountain but then it says at the end of that verse you're gonna continue to drink but you shall be as though you have never been before your arrogance will be brought to an end verse 17 of Obadiah but upon Mount Zion or in the city of Jerusalem shall be deliverance there shall be holiness and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions in other words the Jewish people that's the house of Jacob the Jewish people shall receive all that God has promised to give them and then in verse 18 and the house of Jacob shall be a fire a fire a burning fire that will devour and down through the verse it says and the house of Esau the stubble and they shall Kindle in them and devour them when Jesus Christ returns on the day of his return he goes to the Temple Mount he's ready to walk into the temple the Jews have come with him coming from Edom across that Jordan Valley here to the Mount of Olives making their way across the Kidron Valley up through that eastern gate onto the temple compound there he Jesus Christ will lead them to the temple where he will rest with them he will live among them as the psalmist said forever and ever and ever it's on that day that the Jewish people the house of Jacob shall be a fire and the Edomites the descendants of Esau the present day Palestinians will be devoured there'll be as if they have never been the Prophet Jeremiah in chapter 49 verse 18 says they will be as Sodom and Gomorrah that's basically the story of two brothers remember what God told their mother Rebecca there are two nations in thy womb twenty-fifth chapter of Genesis - matter of people will come forth Jacob he became the Jewish people he saw the older of the two brothers who should have had the birthright and the blessing he had to forego that and his younger brother by God's sovereign selection was made the son of promise these two brothers down through four thousand years of history as God told Moses in constant conflict from generation until generation now culminating here in the city of Jerusalem God's promise his prophecy fulfilled the Jewish people coming to power in the land that he has promised to give them for ever and ever and ever where he will rule and reign with them and live in their presence throughout eternity future it's the story of two brothers you
