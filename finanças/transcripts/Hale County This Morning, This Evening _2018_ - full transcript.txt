Thank you. - Okay. Give me five. Give me five. - High five. - What you want? Thank you so much for making Wendy's your choice. This is Victoria. Would you like to try our junior bacon cheeseburger? No, thank you. First I'd like that four for four meal, Coca-Cola drink. Might as well get two. Two four for four meals, two Coca-Cola drinks. Stop talking like that, man. - That's the way I talk. - So you want to have - a total of three? - Hmm? - You want a total of three? - Total of three what? - Four for four meals. - No, just two. - Okay. - Didn't you say that? You got coke on both of them. What flavor sauce? She said three. - Coke. - Um... She said sauce, damn it. Sweet and sour. And can I add a frosty to your order today? I just love that picture. Oh, my god. - No, thank you. - Okay. Your total's gonna be $8.72. Thank you. - All right. - Stop. I can't stop looking at it. - Looking at what? - That picture. - What picture? - Korbyn with his lip all... Lip all poked out. Really cranky. [Laughing] He was cranky. He was looking dead in my face. I think he wanted me to pick him up. I had karmyn in my arms, and he wanted me to get him. You know he was a mama's boy. Mm-hmm. Then when I laid her down, that's when he stopped. I just love that picture. [Shoes thudding, treadmill humming] [Shoes thudding, treadmill humming] [Nostalgic acoustic music] ♪ ♪ Soothe the pain ♪ [Phone rings] Hello. ♪ Hi!
