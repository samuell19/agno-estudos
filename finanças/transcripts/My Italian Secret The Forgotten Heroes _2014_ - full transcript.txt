[ CROWD CHEERING ] -I LOVE A CHALLENGE. IT MOTIVATES ME TO DO MY BEST. I'M NOT THE KIND OF MAN TO HOLD BACK FROM A FIGHT. -IN 1937, GINO BARTALI WINS THE GINO d'ITALIA FOR THE SECOND STRAIGHT YEAR AND SECURES HIS PLACE AS EUROPE'S BIGGEST SPORTS IDOL. BENITO MUSSOLINI'S FASCIST PARTY HAS RULED ITALY WITH INTIMIDATION AND VIOLENCE FOR 15 YEARS, AND HE WILL SOON LEAD HIS COUNTRY INTO WAR. BEFORE IT IS OVER, GINO BARTALI, LIKE EVERY ITALIAN, WILL FACE A TERRIBLE MORAL CHOICE. -THESE ARE TOUGH TIMES. MOST PEOPLE STRUGGLE JUST TO SURVIVE. IT'S A WORLD WHERE ARROGANCE RULES. SOME HAVE POWER. SOME DON'T. A LIFE CAN HANG BY A THREAD. IT'S A WORLD WHERE YOU MUST DO GOOD -- BUT DON'T TALK ABOUT IT. -GINO BARTALI WAS RISKING HIS LIFE ALL DURING THE WAR. IN MY OPINION, HE IS A HERO. -THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE ALL OVER ITALY WHO KEPT OUR SECRET AND WERE INVOLVED IN OUR RESCUE. LOTS OF BRAVE ITALIANS RISKED THEIR LIVES. [ BELL TOLLING ] I'VE ALWAYS WANTED MY GRANDSON TO KNOW WHAT THEY DID. [ CHILDREN SHOUTING PLAYFULLY ] -BY 1938, WITH WAR LOOMING IN EUROPE, ITALY IS ONE OF THE ONLY SAFE HAVENS FOR JEWS AND OTHER REFUGEES FLEEING NAZI PERSECUTION. [ CROWD CHANTING ] -MY MOTHER WAS PREGNANT WITH ME. SHE WITNESSED KRISTALLNACHT AND DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO LEAVE GERMANY. 10 DAYS AFTER HER ARRIVAL IN MILANO, I WAS BORN. WE WERE LIVING IN MILAN FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS WHEN WE WERE SENT TO FERRAMONTI. I WAS 3 YEARS OLD. BUT IN MY MEMORY, I NEVER EXPERIENCED A BAD FEELING ABOUT THE PLACE. [ SIGHS ] IT'S A VERY STRANGE FEELING... TO BE COMING BACK HERE. -I REALLY, NOW, THOUGHT, "CAN I DO THIS TRIP?" AND THEN I DECIDED IT HAS TO BE DONE. I DID SAY THANK YOU MANY TIMES, BUT IT'S NEVER ENOUGH. WHEN MY FAMILY CAME FROM GERMANY IN '35, I DIDN'T FEEL JEWISH. I FELT ITALIAN. I JOINED THE FASCIST PARTY. I MARCHED EVERY SATURDAY, AND I WAS VERY HAPPY. -MY MOTHER WAS A CATHOLIC, BUT MY FATHER'S FAMILY WAS JEWISH. THEY HAD BEEN IN ITALY FOR MANY GENERATIONS, WERE INTEGRATED INTO ITALIAN SOCIETY. IN FACT, MY AUNT WAS CALLED ITALIA. THEY WERE VERY ACCOMPLISHED, WELL-EDUCATED. MY FATHER STUDIED CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS, AND THEN, VERY YOUNG, HE WAS GIVEN THE DIRECTORSHIP OF A BIG FACTORY IN PADUA. MY FATHER AND MOTHER WERE A VERY HANDSOME COUPLE, AND YOUNG, AND, OF COURSE, THEY MOVED INTO SOCIETY IN PADUA, BUT LITTLE BY LITTLE, THE SOCIETY, LET'S SAY, MOVED AWAY FROM THEM. [ TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS ] [ CROWD CHEERING ] -SOON AFTER ADOLPH HITLER VISITS ROME IN 1938, WITH HIS PLAN FOR A RACIALLY PURE HOMELAND ALREADY UNDERWAY IN GERMANY, IL DUCE DECIDES TO IMPOSE A NEW RACIAL POLICY IN ITALY. "LAWS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE RACE." -WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL THAT DAY, I SAW MY TEACHER TELLING THE PRINCIPAL THAT I AM A JEW. HE SAID, "THIS CHILD IS A JEW." AND THEN THE PRINCIPAL CAME TO ME TOGETHER WITH A POLICEMAN, AND THEY TOLD ME THAT FROM THAT MOMENT, I AM EXPELLED FROM THE SCHOOL, AND I HAVE TO GO HOME. I STARTED TO CRY, BECAUSE I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY I CANNOT GO TO MY SCHOOL. [ CHILDREN LAUGHING ] -PAPA LOST HIS JOB, AND IT BEGAN TO BE MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT. WHAT WAS TERRIBLE WAS THE SILENCE. THESE RACIAL LAWS WERE ACCEPTED, PRAISED, AND SUDDENLY THE JEW WAS REALLY A DIRTY HUMAN BEING. -ALL THIS TALK ABOUT HOMELAND IS JUST PROPAGANDA. THE WORLD IS THE HOMELAND OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS. THE WORDS OF OUR PRIESTS MADE A BIG IMPRESSION ON ME -- "ALWAYS FOLLOW THE TEACHINGS OF JESUS. DO GOOD UNTO OTHERS." -ONE DAY, IN FLORENCE, THE PRESIDENT OF THE CYCLISTS UNION CAME RUNNING UP. IT WAS THE LAST DAY TO QUALIFY FOR THE TOUR de FRANCE, AND HE HAD A TELEGRAM FROM THE FASCIST PARTY SECRETARY ORDERING ME TO LEAVE AT ONCE FOR PARIS. -MUSSOLINI HAS A PLAN TO SHOW OFF ITALY'S ARYAN SUPERIORITY ON THE WORLD STAGE. A BARTALI TRIUMPH IN THE TOUR WOULD PROVE THAT ITALIANS, TOO, BELONG TO THE MASTER RACE. [ TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS ] -THE TOUR de FRANCE. [ SPEAKING FRENCH ] -IN THE PYRENEES, AS BARTALI CHARGES AHEAD, A RECORD CROWD GATHERS ALONG THE SIDELINES. -[ SPEAKING FRENCH ] -ON JULY 31st, HEADLINES ABOUT BARTALI'S LEAD APPEARED NEXT TO A STORY WITH THE LATEST ON ITALY'S NEW POLICY -- "JEWS DO NOT BELONG TO THE ITALIAN RACE." THE NEXT DAY, BARTALI WINS THE TOUR'S CRUCIAL ALPINE STAGE AND HOLDS ONTO THE LEAD ALL THE WAY TO PARIS. -[ SPEAKING FRENCH ] [ CROWD CHEERING ] -THE ITALIAN FASCISTS TAKE CREDIT, CALLING HIM THEIR ARYAN CHAMPION. BARTALI REJECTS THE PARTY'S PATRONAGE, INSULTING IL DUCE. -THE PARTY HAS STARTED A CAMPAIGN AGAINST ME, ACCUSING ME OF LACK OF PATRIOTISM. BUT I'M NOT THE TYPE TO BACK DOWN. -IT'S NOT THE LAST TIME BARTALI WILL DEFY THE FASCISTS. [ INSECTS CHIRPING ] -LOOK AT THAT. PEOPLE LIVED THERE. I LIVED THERE. -IN JUNE 1940, WHEN ITALY ENTERS THE WAR, ALL FOREIGNERS ARE RELOCATED TO CAMPS SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ITALIAN JEWS ARE ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN THEIR OWN HOMES, BUT MORE THAN 10,000 FOREIGN JEWS ARE AMONG THOSE SENT AWAY. THE INTERNEES ARE ALLOWED TO PLAY MUSIC, WEAR THEIR OWN CLOTHING, AND HOLD RELIGIOUS SERVICES. IN THE HILL TOWN OF CAMPANIA, THE INTERNEES LIVE IN A 14th-CENTURY CONVENT AND CAN MOVE ABOUT THE TOWN TO MINGLE WITH THE LOCAL CITIZENS. FERRAMONTI, BUILT IN A MALARIA-RIDDEN SWAMP IN CALABRIA, IS THE LARGEST CAMP, AT TIMES HOLDING UP TO 3,000 PEOPLE. CONDITIONS ARE HARSH AND PRIMITIVE AT FIRST, BUT FAMILIES LIVE TOGETHER, AND THE CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOL. RABBI RICCARDO PACIFICI MAKES REGULAR VISITS FROM GENOA. -WONDER IF I CAN FIND MY FATH-- [ GASPS ] THERE'S -- THAT'S MY MOTHER HOLDING ME, MY FATHER RIGHT THERE BEHIND HER, AT A PICNIC. WOW. I CAN ALMOST FEEL MY PARENTS HERE WITH ME. LITTLE DID THEY PROBABLY EVEN KNOW WHAT WOULD FOLLOW THIS. [ TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS ] [ TRAIN CHUGGING ] [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] -AS THE NAZIS IMPRISON AND MURDER MILLIONS, SOME REFUGEES ARE STILL ABLE TO REACH ITALY. AFTER 1938, MORE THAN 10,000 ITALIAN AND FOREIGN JEWS FIND AN ESCAPE ROUTE, MANY WITH THE HELP OF A RELIEF ORGANIZATION CALLED THE DELEGATION FOR ASSISTANCE TO JEWISH EMIGRANTS, OR DELASEM. THE FASCIST AUTHORITIES COOPERATE TO SPEED UP THE EXIT OF JEWS TO PALESTINE AND THE U.S. AND TAKE A PERCENTAGE OF THE AMERICAN MONEY THAT SUPPORTS THE RESCUE EFFORTS. -GO, GO, GO! -IN THE SUMMER OF 1943, WHEN AMERICA JOINS THE ALLIED INVASION OF SICILY, IT LOOKS LIKE THE END FOR FASCISM IN ITALY. -ENTHUSIASTIC SICILIANS WELCOME THE YANKS WITH OPEN ARMS. FOR THOUSANDS OF WAR-WEARY SICILIANS, THE COMING OF UNITED NATIONS FORCES MEANS FREEDOM FROM FASCISM. -MUSSOLINI IS IMPRISONED, AND THE ITALIANS AGREE TO A CEASE-FIRE ON SEPTEMBER 8, 1943. -FIRE! -THE GERMANS INVADE TO STOP THE ALLIES. THEY FREE MUSSOLINI AND INSTALL HIM AS THE HEAD OF A PUPPET REGIME. ITALY IS DIVIDED IN TWO. IN THE SOUTH, THE ALLIES LIBERATE THE CAMPS FOR FOREIGNERS. IN THE NORTH, THE NAZI S.S. AND THEIR ITALIAN-FASCIST ALLIES TAKE CONTROL AND BEGIN TO HUNT FOR JEWS. -IN THESE DARK DAYS, AS THE GERMANS TIGHTEN THEIR CONTROL, ITALIANS MUST CHOOSE SIDES -- OBEY THE NAZI AUTHORITIES OR RISK YOUR LIFE TO HELP THOSE IN DANGER. SOME TAKE UP ARMS TO JOIN THE RESISTANCE. -THE ITALIAN PARTISANS' MAIN OCCUPATION WAS TO SAVE PEOPLE FROM THE GERMANS. [ MAN SINGING IN ITALIAN ] -THE NAZI S.S. CONTINUED THEIR SWEEP THROUGH NORTHERN ITALY, CREATING NEW DANGER FOR CHARLOTTE AND HER PARENTS. BEFORE THE ALLIES LIBERATED THE CAMPS IN SOUTHERN ITALY, THEY HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO CONFINEMENT IN A SMALL TOWN NEAR VENICE. -WE WERE SENT FROM FERRAMONTI TO LIVE WITH A FASCIST FAMILY. WE LIVED THERE ABOUT A YEAR. THEN WE WERE TOLD BY SOMEONE THAT WE NEEDED TO LEAVE BECAUSE THE NEXT DAY, WE WERE DUE TO BE SHIPPED OFF TO AN EXTERMINATION CAMP. SAMUELE PANICHI WAS A PARTISAN LEADER WHO HELPED US ESCAPE. HE BROUGHT US TO HIDE IN A VILLAGE CALLED SECCHIANO. I REMEMBER WHEN PANICCI DROPPED US OFF AND HANDED US OVER TO HIS FRIENDS, VIRGILIO VIRGILI AND DESOLINA AND MEMMO PARUCCINI, AND THEY WELCOMED US IN. -[ SHOUTS IN ITALIAN ] -[ EXHALES SHARPLY ] [ LAUGHS ] [ CONVERSATION IN ITALIAN ] MWAH! -[ SPEAKING ITALIAN ] CIAO, CIAO. -CIAO. -[ CONVERSING IN ITALIAN ] -[ SPEAKING ITALIAN ] -I REMEMBER AIRPLANES FLYING OVERHEAD, DROPPING LEAFLETS, WARNING THESE PEOPLE, "IF YOU ARE HIDING JEWS OR PARTISANS, YOU'RE DEAD." STILL, THE ENTIRE TOWN WAS IN CAHOOTS TO KEEP OUR SECRET. [ CONGREGATIONAL SINGING ] [ PRIEST SPEAKING ITALIAN ] -I WAS SITTING IN THIS CHURCH WITH MERCEDES. SUDDENLY, THE DOOR SWUNG OPEN, AND A VOICE SCREAMED INTO THE CHURCH. [ DOOR SLAMS, MAN SHOUTS IN ITALIAN ] "THE GERMANS ARE COMING! THEY'RE COMING!" I REMEMBER SHOES AND BOOTS, FEAR. -[ Echoing ] MAMA! MAMA! -NOBODY WAS THERE. AND I THOUGHT, "THE NAZIS GRABBED THEM, AND THEY'RE DEAD. THEY'RE DEAD." AND SUDDENLY, SOMEONE GRABBED ME. THERE WERE LOTS OF PEOPLE HIDING, INCLUDING MY MOTHER. -[ SPEAKING IN ITALIAN ] [ CONGREGATION PRAYING ] -[ GASPS ] [ BELL TOLLING ] [ TOLLING DISTORTS ] -THIS IS A WAR WITHOUT REASON, WITHOUT HONOR. A LIFE COSTS NOTHING. IT CAN DEPEND ON THE WHIM OF ANOTHER. SHOTS ARE FIRED TOO EASILY, AND I'M AGAINST BLOODSHED, ESPECIALLY BROTHER KILLING BROTHER. -IT WAS REALLY DANGEROUS IN FIRENZE, SO I WAS SENT TO LIVE IN A MONASTERY IN SETTIGNANO, WHICH IS ALSO A SMALL VILLAGE JUST NEARBY FIRENZE. AT THAT SAME TIME, MY FATHER STARTED TO LOOK WHERE THE FAMILY CAN HIDE. MY FATHER WAS A FRIEND OF GINO BARTALI, AND HE TOLD BARTALI THAT HE'S LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO HIDE. AND BARTALI HID MY FATHER, MY MOTHER, AND MY SISTER TO THE BASEMENT IN HIS HOUSE -- AT THE BEGINNING, IN HIS APARTMENT ITSELF, AND LATER ON, IN THE BASEMENT OF HIS HOUSE -- IN SPITE OF KNOWING THAT THE GERMANS WERE KILLING EVERYBODY WHO WAS HIDING JEWS. HE WAS RISKING NOT ONLY HIS LIFE, BUT ALSO HIS FAMILY. -BUON GIORNO. -BUON GIORNO. [ CONVERSATION IN ITALIAN ] -WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT IN '39, WE WERE HANDCUFFED, PUT ON A TRAIN FROM ALASSIO TO PERUGIA. -[ SPEAKS ITALIAN ] -SI. THEY TRANSFERRED MY MOTHER AND I AND THEN MY FATHER TO CONFINO LIBERO IN CITTà di CASTELLO. CONFINO LIBERO MEANT THAT WE HAD TO GO FOUR TIMES A DAY AND SIGN AT THE POLICE STATION. WE COULD WALK AROUND. WE COULD DO ANYTHING, BUT NOT AFTER 8:00 AT NIGHT. OTHER THAN THAT, WE LIVED LIKE ALL THE ITALIANS. WE HAD THE SAME COUPONS. WE HAD A FURNISHED ROOM. I WAS IN SCHOOL AT THE SALESIAN NUNS, AND THEN, IN 1943, THE GERMANS OCCUPIED CITTà di CASTELLO AND THE BISHOP SENT FOR ME. HE SAID, "I HEARD ON THE RADIO THEY'RE ARRESTING ALL THE JEWS. GO AND TELL YOUR PARENTS THAT YOU HAVE TO RUN AWAY." AND MONSIGNOR SCHIVO WAS READY TO HELP US. -[ CHUCKLES ] -WHEN THE GERMANS CAME, THE ENTIRE STORY OF OUR SURVIVAL WAS IN THE HANDS OF MONSIGNOR SCHIVO. HE WORKED WITH THE PARTISANS, SO HE KNEW WHAT THE GERMANS WERE PLANNING, SO HE MOVED MY FATHER TO A DORMITORY ACROSS FROM SEMINARY. AND MONSIGNOR SENT MY MOTHER AND I TO THE SACRO CUORE, PLACED AS NUNS. YOU KNOW, THE TALMUD SAYS, "HE WHO SAVES ONE PERSON SAVES THE UNIVERSE." MONSIGNOR SCHIVO SAVED A LOT OF PEOPLE. [ DOOR CREAKS, SLAMS ] [ CHURCH BELLS DINGING ] -HE SAVED SO MANY PEOPLE. -HE SAVED SO MANY PEOPLE. -THEY DEPORTED THEM OR PUT THEM AGAINST THE WALL. -NEVER CAME BACK. [ LAUGHS ] -READING THE STORY WHAT HAPPENED TO US IS ONE THING, BUT LIVING IT IS MUCH MORE INTENSE. WE LIVED IT. [ PEOPLE SHOUTING IN ITALIAN ] [ ENGINE SHUTS OFF ] [ SHOUTING CONTINUES ] [ POUNDING ON DOOR ] [ BABY WAILS ] [ SHOUTING CONTINUES ] -[ SHOUTS IN GERMAN ] [ DOORS OPEN ] [ MEN SHOUTING IN GERMAN ] -BY THE TIME THE FIRST JEWS ARE DEPORTED FROM ITALY, MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO WILL DIE IN NAZI CAMPS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MURDERED. ITALIAN RESCUERS WILL FACE THEIR HARDEST CHALLENGES IN THE DAYS AHEAD. -SI. -CERTO. -CERTO. -SI. -MM. [ SHOUTING IN DISTANCE ] -OH. [ SNIFFLES ] [ SNIFFLES ] -[ SPEAKING ITALIAN ] [ BOTH LAUGH ] -I'M VERY PROUD. -PROUD OF HIM. YEAH. -OF MY FATHER. -THE NAZIS FIND 1,694 JEWS IN ROME AND DEPORT THEM ALL TO AUSCHWITZ. BUT MORE THAN 10,000 AVOID CAPTURE, THANKS TO DR. BORROMEO AND OTHER ITALIAN RESCUERS WITH THE COURAGE TO DEFY THE NAZIS. -THE WAR RAGES ON, WITH ITS VICTIMS, ITS PAIN, AND ITS FEROCIOUS ATROCITIES. THERE IS HATRED, VENGEANCE, AND MALICIOUS GOSSIP. IT'S SO MUCH INJUSTICE, SPURRED ON BY BLIND FANATICISM. -THE GERMANS RELENTLESSLY HOLD THE LINE AT MONTE CASSINO, 80 MILES SOUTH OF ROME. DESPITE OUTNUMBERING THEM THREE TO ONE, THE ALLIES ARE UNABLE TO BREAK THROUGH TO NORTHERN ITALY FOR MONTHS. UNTIL THEY DO, THE S.S. AND ITALIAN FASCISTS CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR JEWS. -WE HAD A NANNY WHOM I ADORED CALLED ISABELLA, AND ISABELLA HAD A LOVER, A CARABINIERI. ONE NIGHT, SOON AFTER THE ARMISTICE, THIS CARABINIERI -- HE WAS CALLED UGO -- CAME TO THE HOUSE. HE RISKED HIS LIFE, AND HE WARNED US. HE SAID, "YOU HAVE TO DISAPPEAR." [ BELL DINGING, INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] AND WE ARRIVED AT PADUA STATION, WHICH WAS ALREADY IN A STATE OF TOTAL CONFUSION. AND WE WERE WITH MY GRANDMOTHER GEMMA AND HER OWN MOTHER. AND WE ALL GOT ON THE PLATFORM. WE HEADED TO THE SOUTH. THEY HEADED TO THE NORTH, TO TURIN. AND WE ONLY KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM AFTER THE WAR, QUITE A LONG TIME AFTER THE WAR. WE DID GO TOWARD THE SOUTH. THE IDEA WAS TO ARRIVE AT ROME. THEN THE TRAIN STOPPED BECAUSE THE RAILS HAD BEEN BOMBED, SO MY FATHER DECIDED, "LET'S TRY SOMEWHERE ELSE." PERFETTO. [ LAUGHS ] [ CONVERSATION IN ITALIAN ] AND SO WE WENT TO OSIMO, TO SEE A GRAND LADY, LE MARCHESA GALLO, WHO HAD WHAT TO ME LOOKED LIKE AN IMMENSE PALACE. SHE WAS SHELTERING A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND THE FAMILIES KNEW EACH OTHER AND SHE SAID, OF COURSE, "I'LL HIDE YOU." [ CHUCKLES ] PALAZZO GALLO WAS THE MAIN PALAZZO OF OSIMO, SO WHEN THE GERMAN COMMAND ARRIVED IN OSIMO, THEY DECIDED TO TAKE IT OVER. AND SO THEY SAID TO THE WAITER, THE BUTLER, THE SERVANT, AND LE MARCHESA GALLO IMMEDIATELY PRODUCED PAPA, WHO WAS VERY ELEGANT, SPOKE SOME GERMAN, AND SO HE APPEARED IN WHITE GLOVES. WE WERE HOPING, REALLY, PROBABLY, TO POISON THE FOOD, RATHER THAN -- BUT FOR SEVERAL DAYS, HE WAS THERE AS THE VERY ELEGANT BUTLER, AND THE FAMILY DOWN THERE, THE FAMILY OF THE BUTLER. [ CLOCK CHIMES ] I WAS QUITE INTIMIDATED BECAUSE THE HOUSE WAS GRAND. SHE WAS GRAND. AND WE WERE TRAINED TO BOW WHEN WE SAW HER. MY FATHER INVENTED GAMES, TRIED TO ALWAYS TELL US STORIES AND MAKE US FEEL THAT WE WERE LIVING NORMAL TIMES. MY MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE APPREHENSIVE, ALSO BECAUSE, I THINK, BEING A WOMAN, SHE WAS MUCH MORE -- SHE COULD SEE MUCH MORE CLEARLY THE THREAT. ONE DAY, WHEN MY PARENTS WERE PLAYING BRIDGE WITH LA MARCHESA GALLO, THE FOURTH PLAYER WAS A FORMER MAYOR [SPEAKING ITALIAN] AND WHILE PLAYING, THE PODISTA LOOKED AT MY FATHER AND SAID, "BUT YOU'RE NOT CORRADO PRINZI. YOU ARE LUXARDO SERVADIO. I RECOGNIZE YOU." HE GOT UP AND LEFT. ON THE FOLLOWING DAY, HE WENT TO SEE LE MARCHESA. HE SAID, "LOOK, WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR A LONG TIME, AND I SHOULD REALLY DENOUNCE YOU, AND YOU WOULD BE SHOT. BUT INSTEAD, I GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF DAYS TO GET RID OF THESE PEOPLE." -[ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] -AND LA MARCHESA THEN CALLED PAPA AND SAID, "LOOK, LUXARDO, YOU MUST NOW DISAPPEAR. YOU MUSTN'T BE HERE. YOU GO TO THE COUNTRYSIDE." SO MY FATHER DISAPPEARED, AND SUDDENLY WE DIDN'T SEE HIM AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM. MY MOTHER WAS ALONE WITH THESE TWO SMALL CHILDREN. THEN, FINALLY, THE EIGHTH ARMY LIBERATED OSIMO. BUT AFTER THREE DAYS, THE GERMANS TOOK IT BACK AGAIN, SO WE WERE WARNED IMMEDIATELY. THEY CAME AND SAID, "YOU MUST DISAPPEAR. YOU MUST CROSS THE LINES. YOU MUST GO TO PORTO RECANATI. JUST A FEW MILES AWAY, THERE WAS LIBERTY. AND SO MY MOTHER AND MY SISTER AND I, ON ONE BICYCLE, WITH OUR POSSESSIONS, WE LEFT OSIMO. IT WAS NOT VERY HOPEFUL THAT WE WOULD GET TO THE OTHER SIDE. SO, FINALLY, WHEN WE GOT TO PORTO RECANATI, TOOK MONTHS BEFORE WE FOUND MY FATHER -- OR, RATHER, MY FATHER FOUND US. I HAVE TERRIBLE SADNESS AND FEELING OF GUILT TOWARDS LA MARCHESA GALLO, THIS EXTRAORDINARY WOMAN WHO, IN FACT, RISKED HER OWN LIFE BY HIDING US. AFTER THE WAR, I FEEL WE ALL SHOULD HAVE GONE AND SAID THANK YOU. WE WERE TOO HUMILIATED, TOO READY TO HIDE TO OURSELVES FIRST. SO BY THE TIME I WENT TO PALAZZO GALLO, SHE HAD JUST DIED. I SAW THE DAUGHTERS, AND I REMEMBER SORT OF LOOKING FOR THE PLACE, FINDING IT, RECOGNIZING IT, PRESSING, YOU KNOW, THE BELL, AND ONE OF THE DAUGHTERS CAME OUT, AND SHE EMBRACED ME, CRYING, BOTH OF US. AND MY POOR ENGLISH HUSBAND WHO WAS WITH ME DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL WAS HAPPENING. [ LAUGHS ] AND SO IT WAS VERY EMOTIONAL. AND I THEN SAID, "I'M SO SAD NOT TO SEE HER, 'CAUSE SHE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY WOMAN." [ CONVERSATION IN ITALIAN ] [ BELL DINGING ] -SEPTEMBER 1943 -- GINO BARTALI IS SUMMONED TO THE DUOMO BY HIS FRIEND CARDINAL DALLA COSTA, ARCHBISHOP OF FLORENCE. AFTER THEIR MEETING, BARTALI OFTEN LEAVES HOME, DISAPPEARING ON HIS BICYCLE FOR DAYS AT A TIME. HE SETS OFF AS IF HE WERE BACK IN TRAINING, BUT NEVER TELLS ANYONE WHERE HE'S GOING, NOT EVEN HIS WIFE. -WHAT BARTALI'S DOING, WHERE HE'S GOING, AND WHY REMAINS A SECRET FOR MOST OF HIS LIFE. BUT YEARS LATER, HE TELLS ONE PERSON. [ BELL TOLLING ] -THERE IS NO WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF HIS WARTIME ACTIVITIES, ONLY THE TESTIMONY OF A FEW WITNESSES AND, 50 YEARS LATER, WHAT BARTALI HIMSELF BEGRUDGINGLY ADMITS TO HIS BIOGRAPHER. -I PUT MYSELF TO WORK WITH MY FRIEND BERTI TO HELP JEWS FLEE THE COUNTRY. THAT'S WHEN MY TRAVELS STARTED TO ROME AND ASSISI. -MY FRIEND BERTI GETS DOCUMENTS FROM CARDINAL DALLA COSTA AND GIVES THEM TO ME TO DELIVER TO THE BISHOP IN ASSISI. I HIDE THEM IN THE FRAME OF MY BICYCLE. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT'S FOR, IN CASE THEY CATCH ME. -BARTALI HAD A SPECIAL PERMIT TO RIDE ALL AROUND TUSCANY, BUT THERE WAS STILL DANGER. WHEN HE WAS RIDING HIS BICYCLE WITH FALSE DOCUMENTS, IF THE NAZIS FOUND OUT, THEY WILL KILL HIM IMMEDIATELY, ON THE SPOT, NOT BY BRINGING HIM TO COURT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- NOTHING. THEY WILL KILL HIM ON THE SPOT. -ONE OF BARTALI'S DESTINATIONS IS THE BASILICA OF ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI, A CENTER OF CLANDESTINE ACTIVITY OVERSEEN BY THE BISHOP GIUSEPPE NICOLINI. FATHER ALDO BRUNACCI AND OTHER PRIESTS FIND HIDING PLACES FOR THE REFUGEES. -I FOUND OUT LATER THAT THE DOCUMENTS I WAS CARRYING WERE I.D. CARDS WITH FALSE NAMES. THEY MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR JEWS IN HIDING TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND REACH THE FREED TERRITORIES IN THE SOUTH. -MORE AND MORE REFUGEES FIND THEIR WAY TO ASSISI. TO FULFILL THE GROWING DEMAND, THE UNDERGROUND RECRUITS LUIGI AND TRENTO BRIZI, WHO HAVE A PRINTING PRESS IN THEIR SHOP NEXT TO THE ST. FRANCIS BASILICA. [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] [ BELL TOLLING ] -BARTALI ALSO RIDES TO FARNETA, PART OF AN UNDERGROUND NETWORK EXTENDING FROM FLORENCE TO GENOA AND ASSISI. IT IS A COMPLEX ORGANIZATION BROKEN INTO INDEPENDENT CELLS TO AVOID BETRAYAL BY SPIES. NO ONE KNOWS THE ACTIVITIES OF THE OTHERS. THIS MONASTERY IS A REFUGE FOR THOSE FLEEING THE NAZIS, INCLUDING MANY JEWS, WHO WERE TAKEN IN BY THE MONKS AND THEN MOVED TO TOWNS IN THE NEARBY MOUNTAINS. -THE NAZIS TAKE 150 PRISONERS -- MONKS, PARTISANS, ITALIAN DESERTERS, AND TWO JEWS. THE S.S. INTERROGATES, TORTURES, AND MURDERS 49 OF THEM. THEY SEND THE REST TO LABOR CAMPS, WHERE MANY DIE. BUT IN THE 11 MONTHS BEFORE THE MASSACRE, MORE THAN 200 JEWS ESCAPE DEPORTATION BY THE NAZIS, THANKS TO THE COURAGE OF FATHER GABRIELE COSTA. HE IS AMONG THE FIRST TO BE SHOT. -THESE ARE TERRIBLE TIMES, BUT A SENSE OF DUTY AND HUMAN SOLIDARITY KEEPS US GOING. WE HAVE TO BE CUNNING [CHUCKLES] TO SAVE OUR OWN SKIN AND OTHERS IN DANGER. -26 MONASTERIES AND CONVENTS IN TUSCANY, INCLUDING MANY THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CLOISTERED, OR SEALED OFF FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD, BECOME PART OF THE CLANDESTINE NETWORK. THEY PROVIDE HIDING PLACES FOR HUNDREDS OF REFUGEES. -THE JEWISH KIDS WERE HIDDEN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, AS SOON AS THE PERSECUTION STARTED. AND I AM ONE OF THE CHILDREN WHO WERE SAVED BY THE NUN OF SETTIGNANO. -I AM SURE THAT A LOT OF THE NUNS KNEW THAT WE WERE JEW, BUT OFFICIALLY, ONLY THE MADRE SUPERIORA KNEW ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE WERE JEW. NAZI OFFICERS WERE COMING TO THE CONVENT TO LOOK FOR JEWISH CHILDREN, AND THEY ASKED THE CHILDREN TO STAY IN LINES AND SAY THE CATHOLIC PRAYERS -- "AVE MARIA," "PATER NOSTER." AND THE MADRE SUPERIORA WAS STAYING BEHIND THE GERMAN OFFICER, SAYING WITH HER LIPS WITHOUT -- NOT LOUD -- THE PRAYERS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE CHILDREN WOULD SAY THE RIGHT WORD. [ BELLS TOLLING ] -WE JUST ACTED SPONTANEOUSLY EVERY TIME THESE DESPERATE HUMAN BEINGS CAME KNOCKING ON OUR DOOR, UNDER THE THREAT OF ARRESTS, CONCENTRATION CAMPS, SHOOTINGS, AND WARS. [ CONVERSATION IN ITALIAN ] [ TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS ] [ CONVERSATION IN ITALIAN ] [ GATE CREAKS ] -VIRGILIO VIRGILI, THE MAN WHO HELPED US, IS MERCEDES' FATHER. -[ SPEAKS IN ITALIAN ] -SI. SI. AFTER A TIME, VIRGILIO THOUGHT IT WAS GETTING TOO DANGEROUS FOR US IN SECCHIANO, SO MERCEDES, HER FATHER, MY PARENTS, AND I STARTED ON A LONG JOURNEY BY FOOT. -AND THEN MERCEDES AND HER FATHER LEFT... ...AND WE PROCEEDED ON TO WHERE THE ALLIES WERE, AND WE WERE DELIVERED TO THEM. AND ONLY YEARS LATER DID I FIND OUT ABOUT WHAT MERCEDES' FATHER WENT THROUGH. HE WAS PICKED UP BY THE NAZIS, AND FOR THREE DAYS, HE WAS TORTURED, AND HE DID NOT LIVE LONG AFTER THAT. -STRANGELY ENOUGH, I'M LOOKING FOR AN EMPTY TOMB. IT'S THE TOMB OF MY GRANDMOTHER. MY FATHER, FOR A LONG TIME, DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND WENT ON LOOKING FOR TRACES OF HER. [ ROOSTER CROWS ] AFTER THE WAR, SOME LETTERS ARRIVED, SENT FROM THIS CAMP CALLED FOSSOLI. MY MOTHER BURST INTO TEARS. -JUNE 14, 1944 -- WE ARRIVED FOUR WEEKS AGO LAST NIGHT, WEAK FROM HUNGER AND LACK OF SLEEP. WE ARE IN LOW SPIRITS. PHYSICALLY, MOTHER'S DECLINING. THIS IS MY GREATEST SORROW. -AND THEN THEY WERE SENT FROM FOSSOLI TO AUSCHWITZ. PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT CAMPS BY THEN, BUT IT WAS UNIMAGINABLE. MY FATHER, HE USED TO GO TO THE RAILWAY STATION IN VERONA AFTER THE WAR, WAITING FOR THE TRAINS OF THESE FEW PEOPLE COMING BACK, AND ONE DAY FOUND ONE RELATIVE, AND SHE WAS A SURVIVOR FROM AUSCHWITZ. AND HE SAID, "PLEASE TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED TO MY MOTHER." AND SHE SAID, "SHE WAS LUCKY," AND HER MOTHER WAS LUCKY, BECAUSE THEY WERE SELECTED IMMEDIATELY AND SENT INSIDE A GAS OVEN ALMOST AT ONCE, SO THEY WERE SPARED, EITHER WAY, THE HORROR OF THE REST. SO, THIS IS THE TOMB OF MY GRANDFATHER, CAVOUR. HERE IS MY GRANDMOTHER. PAPA TOLD ME WHEN I WAS QUITE YOUNG WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO MY GRANDMOTHER AND TO HER MOTHER. I STARTED HATING EVERYBODY, WHICH I OVERCAME, OF COURSE, AND I FELT THIS GREAT INJUSTICE OVER THESE UNNECESSARY MARTYRDOMS OF ALL THESE PEOPLE. BUT I MUST SAY THERE WERE ALSO GOOD THINGS, BECAUSE THERE IS A SIDE OF THE ITALIANS WHICH IS WARM, WHICH SAVED, WHICH TOOK PITY, RISKING A LOT. AND THAT, I ALWAYS REMEMBER. -THE END OF '44, MY MOTHER CAME TO THE CONVENT AND TOOK ME OUT AND BROUGHT ME TO THE SAME CELLAR IN WHICH THEY WERE HIDING. GINO BARTALI SAVED MY LIFE AND THE LIFE OF MY FAMILY. THAT'S CLEAR, BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT HIDDEN IN THE CELLAR. THEY DIDN'T HAVE A PLACE TO GO. AND SO WE WERE SAVED BECAUSE WE WERE FRIENDS OF GINO BARTALI -- BUT NOT ONLY GINO BARTALI. A BIG PART OF THE ITALIANS IN THAT PLACE -- THEY SAVED JEWS. IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN WHY THEY DID IT, BUT MOST OF THE ITALIANS WERE SAVED JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE, WHO EVEN DIDN'T KNOW THEM, JUST COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY YOU SHOULD KILL SOMEBODY JUST BECAUSE HE'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHOIR SINGING IN ITALIAN ] -IN 1948, AGAINST ALL ODDS, HIS STRONGEST YEARS LOST TO THE WAR, GINO BARTALI TRIUMPHS AGAIN IN THE TOUR de FRANCE, 10 YEARS AFTER HIS FIRST WIN. HIS VICTORY HELPS UNITE AN ITALY STRUGGLING TO GET BACK ON ITS FEET. BUT BARTALI IS RETICENT IF ASKED ABOUT HIS WARTIME ACTIVITIES. WHEN THERE IS A RUMOR FLOATING OF HIS CONNECTION WITH ASSISI AND THE RESISTANCE, HE SHRUGS IT OFF, SAYING HIS SILENCE IS OUT OF RESPECT FOR THOSE WHO RISKED MORE THAN HE DID. -SOME MEDALS AREN'T MEANT TO BE WORN ON YOUR SHIRT, BUT ON YOUR SOUL.
