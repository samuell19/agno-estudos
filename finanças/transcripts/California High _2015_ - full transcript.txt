AT THIS POINT, I'M THE LONGEST-SERVING MARIJUANA EMPLOYEE IN THE UNITED STATES. I HAVE BEEN WORKING 22 CONSECUTIVE YEARS, 70 HOURS A WEEK, SIX TO SEVEN DAYS A WEEK TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA. "NORML" IS AMERICA'S MARIJUANA LOBBY GROUP, AND IT HAS BEEN SINCE 1970. WE BELIEVE THAT THE RESPONSIBLE USE OF MARIJUANA BY ADULTS IS NO BUSINESS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND IT SHOULD BE LEGAL AND TAXED LIKE ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO PRODUCTS. A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE BELIEVE IN OPEN SOCIETY, WHICH IS PEOPLE CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT, WHENEVER THEY WANT, HOWEVER THEY WANT, BASICALLY WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SEEING TODAY SOME OF THE HIGHEST DRUG USAGE IN AMERICA IN A GENERATION, AND THAT TO ME IS JUST PURE EVIL. I TELL PEOPLE, "LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO CALIFORNIA, AND DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO YOU." THIS IS A STORY THAT'S GOT TO BE TOLD. I DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS FIGHT. I ENDED UP INTO IT. IN THE FIRST DAYS I WORKED AT NORML IN 1991, I THOUGHT, "WE'RE GONNA GET MARIJUANA LEGAL IN THE NEXT TWO OR THREE YEARS," BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT NEEDS TO BE LEGALIZED. WELL, 20 YEARS LATER AND A LOT OF GRAY HAIR, MARIJUANA'S BEEN ILLEGAL IN THE COUNTRY FOR ALMOST 75 YEARS. [CHABOT] WHAT THE DRUG LEGALIZATION CROWD ACROSS THE U.S. AND ACROSS THE WORLD HAS TO UNDERSTAND IS THEY WILL NEVER BEAT US. WE ARE IMPASSIONED, WE ARE MOTIVATED, AND WE ARE NEVER GONNA GIVE UP. [ST. PIERRE] STRATEGICALLY SPEAKING, WE ARE OBSESSED WITH CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA IS ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, WHERE ALL OF THE EFFORT IS FOCUSED. WE BELIEVE THAT IF YOU CAN FLIP CALIFORNIA, YOU CAN FLIP AMERICA. IF YOU CAN FLIP AMERICA, YOU FLIP THE WORLD ON CANNABIS. [ST. PIERRE] CALIFORNIA HAS A TOTALLY DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE UNITED STATES ON SO MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS. ONE OUT OF EIGHT AMERICANS LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IS THE SIXTH OR SEVENTH LARGEST IN THE WORLD BETWEEN ITALY AND FRANCE. CALIFORNIA IS A NATION STATE ALL BY ITSELF ENSCONCED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. PLACES LIKE LOS ANGELES ARE NOW CENTERS THAT BROADCAST AMERICAN CULTURE NOT ONLY TO AMERICA, BUT TO THE WORLD. SO, WHEN YOU ASK THE QUESTION, "WHAT IS THE INFLUENCE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ON AMERICA?" IT IS PROFOUND. [ST. PIERRE] CALIFORNIA IS THE STATE THAT ABSOLUTELY VETTED MARIJUANA MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE. SINCE AT LEAST THE 1970s, CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, VOTING ON, DISPUTING MARIJUANA LIKE NO OTHER PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES, AND FRANKLY, THE WORLD, AND I THINK MOVING TOWARDS LEGALIZATION. [MAN] THE THING THAT'S MOST STRIKING TO ME ABOUT MARIJUANA IS THE DECADES-- DECADES, NOT YEARS, NOT MONTHS, BUT DECADES WHERE THIS BATTLE GOES ON, AND IT'S THE PRO VERSUS THE ANTI. [MALE ANNOUNCER] BUT WITH MARIJUANA COMES A VENGEFUL CONFRONTATION WITH THE LAW. ITS MERE POSSESSION IN THE EYES OF THE FEDERALS STATUTES BRINGS A MINIMUM OF TWO YEARS, AND SELLING, A MAXIMUM OF 40. THE SIMPLEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IS-- WHICH I THINK IS VERY INTERESTING-- IS THAT AS THE PROBLEM GETS WORSE, THE ANTI-FORCES BECOME STRONG. AS THE PROBLEM GETS BETTER, THE PRO FORCES GET STRONGER. FROM 1978 TO 1991, MARIJUANA USE IN THIS COUNTRY WENT DOWN BY 60 PERCENT. WHEN IT WENT DOWN, IT SOWED THE SEEDS OF THE RENAISSANCE OF THE PRO-MARIJUANA MOVEMENT BECAUSE IT WENT AWAY AS AN ISSUE. AND ALL THE FORCE THAT WAS BEHIND MARIJUANA VANISHED. NOW WE'RE IN A PERIOD WHEN IT'S GOING UP, AND EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING NOW, THE LEGALIZATION, THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA, ALL THAT STUFF, IS DRIVING THOSE MARIJUANA USE RATES UP. [CHABOT] WE WEREN'T AWAKE FIVE YEARS AGO, OR TEN YEARS AGO, OR BACK IN 1996 WHEN IT PASSED. EVERYBODY LEGITIMATELY THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS GONNA HELP TERMINALLY ILL PEOPLE. WE WERE FOOLED. AND YOU LOOK AT IT NOW, IT'S SO CLEAR TO ALL OF US, AND I THINK CLEAR TO THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIAN. [ST. PIERRE] WHEN WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF MARIJUANA IN THE UNITED STATES, ONE HAS TO BEGIN WITH CALIFORNIA, AND ONE HAS TO BEGIN WITH THE LAW IN 1996 CALLED PROP 215. IT WAS SO BROADLY WRITTEN THAT IT CREATED MANY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE TO THIS DAY, ALMOST 20 YEARS LATER, STILL VEXING. IF YOU TALK TO CALIFORNIA VOTERS TODAY, THEY HAD NO IDEA THEY WERE VOTING FOR THIS. IN 1996, THE ARGUMENT WAS REALLY, THIS IS NOT LEGALIZING MARIJUANA. THIS IS ONLY FOR SERIOUSLY SICK, DYING, OR SENSE-THREATENED PEOPLE. [CHABOT] WHEN YOU READ PROPOSITION 215, IT LEADS THE VOTER TO BELIEVE THEY'RE VOTING FOR SOMETHING TO HELP SOMEBODY OUT WHO'S DYING ON THEIR DEATHBED. BUT THERE'S A SENTENCE IN THAT PROPOSITION THAT MOST OF US DIDN'T READ THAT SAYS YOU CAN GET MARIJUANA FOR ANY CONDITION WHATSOEVER THAT PROVIDES RELIEF. THAT'S ANYTHING. [MAN] THE ONLY THING YOU NEED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO GET A MEDICAL MARIJUANA CARD IS $100 AND A STORY. YOU NEED TO TELL A PHYSICIAN WHO'S SITTING SOMEWHERE NEAR, GENERALLY SPEAKING, A CANNABIS CLUB, THAT YOU HAVE AN OLD INJURY FROM HIGH SCHOOL, THAT YOU HAVE ANXIETY, THAT YOU HAVE DEPRESSION, THAT YOU HAVE TRAUMA FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD. AND HE OR SHE WILL PRESCRIBE YOU A MEDICAL MARIJUANA CARD. YOU TAKE THAT CARD TO GO TO THE DISPENSARY, AND FROM THAT MOMENT FORWARD YOU ARE A LICENSED MEDICAL MARIJUANA USER. [CHABOT] THEY TRICKED US. AND I MEAN "US". ALL OF US IN CALIFORNIA. AND NOW WE'RE DEALING WITH THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT. YOU GUYS SMOKE WEED? FUCK, YEAH. TELL 'EM HOW MUCH YOU SMOKE, MAN. I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, THE WEED IN CALIFORNIA IS THE BEST WEED, MAN. [CHABOT] YOU'VE GOT MORE THAN 1,000 POT STORES ON THE STREETS OF L.A. MORE POT STORES THAN STARBUCKS, 7-ELEVENS, McDONALDS, BANKS, AND ALL THE SCHOOLS COMBINED. IT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO ENJOY THEMSELVES. I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. AND I DON'T SMOKE, AND I'M TOTALLY OKAY WITH IT. THIS RIGHT HERE ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WEED ON YOU AT ALL TIMES. IT ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO GO INTO A MEDICAL STORE AND PURCHASE SOME MARIJUANA. WE KNOW THAT OUR BODIES, BRAINS, AND CELLS MAKE CHEMICALS SIMILAR TO MARIJUANA. THAT MEANS THAT WE ACTUALLY CAN RESPOND TO IT IN A WAY THAT MIGHT BE THERAPEUTIC. SO, I DON'T THINK THAT EVERYBODY WHO SMOKES MARIJUANA IS LYING ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT HELPS THEM. TWO SHOTS OF VODKA MIGHT ALSO HELP THEM. DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE MAKE THAT A MEDICINE. YOU CAN'T DO IT IN FRONT OF THE COPS, BUT YOU CAN SMOKE WEED. THEY CAN STOP YOU IF YOU HAVE WEED ON YOU, BUT THEY CAN'T DO SHIT TO YOU 'CAUSE YOU GOT A MEDICAL CARD. IT'S LIKE HAVING A BADGE, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? YOU JUST FLIP IT OUT ON 'EM AND THEY CAN'T DO SHIT. HERE'S THE IRONY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE'VE DONE A GREAT JOB GETTING PEOPLE TO QUIT SMOKING CIGARETTES. IT'S REMARKABLE. YOU CAN'T SMOKE ON MANY OF OUR BEACHES, YOU CAN'T SMOKE IN A RESTAURANT, BECAUSE IT'S BAD FOR YOU. WELL, SO IS SMOKING MARIJUANA. PLUS YOU GET ALL THE OTHER THC-- TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL. SO, HOW CAN THE STATE SAY, "IT'S OKAY TO SMOKE DOPE, BUT WE WANT YOU TO STOP SMOKING CIGARETTES"? ALICE IN WONDERLAND. WE'VE GONE DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE IN CALIFORNIA. I HOPE NOBODY ELSE DOES ACROSS THE GLOBE. [MAN] YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THIS VIEW OF AMERICA BEING THE FREEST COUNTRY ON EARTH, BUT WE HAVE ONE OF THE HIGH-- BIGGEST PRISON POPULATIONS PER CAPITA IN THE WORLD. HOW CAN THAT BE, IN THE FREEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD? SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE. [MAN] WE HAVE A MILLION PEOPLE IN PRISON IN THE UNITED STATES, AND ABOUT HALF OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE DRUG-RELATED OFFENSES. IN CALIFORNIA, WE'VE GONE A LONG WAY TO REDUCE PENALTIES FOR MINOR POSSESSIONS AND POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA, BUT IT STILL REMAINS A FELONY TO GROW EVEN ONE PLANT IN CALIFORNIA. [ST. PIERRE] EVEN IN MY OWN FAMILY THIS HAS COME TO BE A CONCERN. MY BROTHER ORGANIZED AN INVESTMENT GROUP TO SELL MEDICAL MARIJUANA. LITERALLY THE NEXT DAY HE WAS ON THE PHONE, ASKED FOR MY HELP, WANTED TO HIRE ME AWAY FROM NORML. IN HIS MIND, READING THE HEADLINES, MARIJUANA FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES WAS LEGAL. BUT WHAT I NEEDED TO ASK HIM AS MY BROTHER, AND THE SAME THING I SAY TO GANJA-PRENEURS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IS THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT IN SOME STATES YOU CAN GO TO A 24-7 VENDING KIOSK FOR MARIJUANA, ARE YOU OKAY WITH RAISING ALL THIS MONEY, INVESTING IT, GETTING A MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARY GOING, AND STILL MAYBE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT HAVING YOUR DOOR FLY OFF THE HINGES, HAVING POLICE, FEDERAL AGENTS, RUN IN YOUR DOOR, AND VIOLENTLY INTERVENE IN YOUR LIFE? ARREST YOU, PROSECUTE YOU, POTENTIALLY INCARCERATE YOU, TAKE AWAY YOUR ASSETS? AND HIS REPLY WAS, "WELL, NO." [MAN] IT STILL IS A CRIME. AND STILL, IF YOU GO TO THE COURTHOUSES TODAY, YOU'LL SEE ALMOST HALF THE CALENDAR ARE MARIJUANA CASES. PEOPLE THINK, "OH, IT'S LEGALIZED. IT'S NO PROBLEM." WELL, GO DOWN TO THE COURTHOUSE AND FIND OUT WHOSE PROBLEM IT IS. FIND OUT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING ARRESTED. MORE THIS YEAR THAN THE YEAR BEFORE, AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT, AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT. SO, IT'S VERY DISHEARTENING TO SIT HERE AFTER 40-SOME YEARS AND FIND PRETTY MUCH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME ISSUES, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS THAT HAS CAUSED US TO LEAD THIS PATH. [MICHAEL CORRAL] I'VE BEEN CULTIVATING MARIJUANA SINCE ABOUT 1975 WHEN IT WAS ILLEGAL. I BEGAN CULTIVATING TO SUPPLY TO MY EX-WIFE VALERIE MARIJUANA FOR HER EPILEPTIC SEIZURES. SHE WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT, SUSTAINED HEAD INJURIES, AND BECAME EPILEPTIC AS A RESULT OF THOSE INJURIES. MY SEIZURE DISORDER IS THE RESULT OF A CAR ACCIDENT IN 1973. ONE DAY YOU'RE IN UNIVERSITY, AND THE NEXT DAY YOU'RE HOSPITALIZED FOR BRAIN TRAUMA AND UNABLE TO STRING A SENTENCE TOGETHER. SEEKING AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE DRUGS THAT WERE NOT CONTROLLING MY SOME FIVE GRAND MALS A DAY ON A BAD DAY AND BEING HOSPITALIZED AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH, I SOUGHT AN ALTERNATIVE. FINDING SOMETHING SO SIMPLE AS USING MARIJUANA WAS AN ASTONISHING FINDING, ONE THAT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO BELIEVE BECAUSE MY INSURANCE COMPANY WAS SPENDING A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY ON NEUROSURGEONS AND THERE WERE NO ALTERNATIVES. [MICHAEL] WE ALWAYS GREW FIVE PLANTS EVERY YEAR, AND WHENEVER A FRIEND WOULD BE DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER OR HIV-- BECAUSE WE GREW IT, WE ALWAYS HAD MARIJUANA, AND WE WOULD GIVE IT TO THEM. VALERIE STARTED SHARING WHAT SHE HAD WITH OTHER PATIENTS, AND THE "WAMM" COLLECTIVE WAS BORN. FOR YEARS, WE COULD ONLY SERVE THE SICKEST PATIENTS-- MOSTLY CANCER AND AIDS. BUT WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND OUR MEMBERSHIP, SERVE MORE PEOPLE, AND JUST TRY TO PROVIDE THAT QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE. WE WORK TOGETHER TO HELP TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER, EVEN UNTO DEATH, YOU KNOW? WE DO A LOT OF HOSPICE WORK BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF TERMINAL PATIENTS. THIS HAS AFFORDED ME AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY, ONE THAT MANY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE, AND THAT'S TO WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING. EVERYTHING FALLS AWAY THAT'S UNIMPORTANT, SO THAT RELATIONSHIP YOU BUILD WITH SOMEONE IS PROFOUND AND FRAUGHT WITH THE OPPORTUNITY OR POSSIBILITY OF MAKING MISTAKES. WHEN ONE ACCEPTS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE THE ALTERNATIVE FOR HEALTHCARE, WHERE YOU REPRESENT THEIR WISHES WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE, YOU HAVE TO LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY, TO NOT INSINUATE. IT GIVES US THE CHANCE TO DELIVER TO PEOPLE REALLY WHAT THEY WANT, AND THAT'S FAR BEYOND CANNABIS. IT'S FAR BEYOND ANY SINGLE TOOL. BECAUSE CANNABIS, LIKE ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD, IS A TOOL, AND WE USE IT, REALLY, FOR HEALING. BEING IN UNIVERSITY WOULD HAVE NEVER GIVEN ME THIS OPPORTUNITY. THOUGH MANY GREAT THINGS CAN COME FROM THAT, THAT WASN'T MY COURSE. IT WASN'T MY PATH. TECHNICALLY SPEAKING, AND ACCORDING TO THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION, THERE'S NO MEDICAL VALUE AT ALL FOR MARIJUANA. MARIJUANA HAS NOT GAINED ACCEPTANCE AS A MEDICATION, EVEN THOUGH AT ONE POINT THREE OF MY DOCTORS RECOMMENDED IT FOR ME TO TREAT THE PAIN. I HAD POLIO AS AN INFANT, AND NOW I HAVE POST-POLIO SYNDROME AND I HAVE A LOT OF MUSCLE SPASMS-- MUSCLE PAIN, NERVE PAIN. I'M ALLERGIC TO OPIATES, AND THEY DON'T REALLY WORK FOR NERVE PAIN ANYWAY. I REALLY DON'T HAVE MANY OPTIONS FOR PAIN CONTROL, AND THIS IS WHAT I CHOOSE TO USE. [CHABOT] FROM 1996 TO NOW, THERE'S BEEN THREE OTHER PROPOSITIONS ON THE BALLOT, AND ALL IT ALL STARTED OUT WITH SO-CALLED "HELPING SICK PEOPLE." NOW, THAT SAME GROUP, THAT SAME CORE THAT PROMOTED THAT, IS NOW TRYING TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA OUTRIGHT. IT'S PRACTICALLY LEGAL ANYWAY. ANYONE CAN GO TO THE STORE AND GET A MEDICAL CARD FOR $45. [CHABOT] WHAT REALLY HAPPENS IS THE MEDIA, WHEN THEY REPORT ON THIS, THEY'RE GONNA GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO GO FIND SOMEBODY WHO'S GOT AIDS OR CANCER TO INTERVIEW FOR THEIR QUOTE IN THEIR STORY. THEY'RE NOT GONNA SIT OUT IN THE FRONT OF A MARIJUANA STORE AND GO TALK TO THE 19-YEAR-OLD KID ON THE SKATEBOARD. THAT DOESN'T MAKE A GREAT STORY. EVERYBODY I KNOW SMOKES. COME ON, YOU'RE IN L.A. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? A CALIFORNIA STUDY OF 7,000 PATIENTS FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE MEDICAL MARIJUANA USER IS A 32-YEAR-OLD WHITE MALE WHO HAD USED COCAINE IN HIS LIFETIME AND HAD NO HISTORY OF CHRONIC DISEASE. SO, MEDICAL MARIJUANA IN CALIFORNIA HAS TURNED INTO A SAD JOKE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE AREN'T MEDICAL PROPERTIES IN THE MARIJUANA PLANT THAT WE SHOULD RESEARCH AND INVESTIGATE, BUT WE SHOULD DO THAT IN THE LABORATORY NOT IN THE BALLOT BOX. [MAN] MY NAME IS CHRISTIAN KLUMP. I'M THE DIRECTOR OF 420 COLLECTIVE SINCE AUGUST 2008. THIS IS OUR SECURITY GUY JIM. HE WILL CHECK I.D.'s SO THAT THE QUALIFIED PATIENTS COME AND SEE US AND BECOME MEMBERS OF OUR COLLECTIVE. I WAS ALWAYS AGAINST AN ARMED GUARD. NOW IT IS REQUIRED. THE PATIENT WILL COME IN HERE. WE WILL HAVE THEM FILL OUT A FORM WHICH BASICALLY EXPLAINS OUR RULES. MOST OF OUR PATIENTS ARE OLDER PEOPLE. WE DON'T ALLOW ANYONE UNDER 21. THROUGH THE INTERNET, WE'RE ABLE TO VERIFY THE DOCTOR RECOMMENDATION. THERE ARE SERVICES ON THE INTERNET WITH CODE NUMBERS WHERE YOU CAN SEE, "OKAY, THIS IS LEGITIMATE." IT'S JUST WAY MORE STRICTER THAN IT WOULD BE AT ANY PHARMACY WHO SELLS WAY MORE DANGEROUS DRUGS THAN WE DO. SIX YEARS AGO, I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PROSTATE CANCER, AND BATTLED THAT, HAD SURGERY. WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO COME BACK FROM THAT, AND THAT HAD OPENED MY EYES UP TO THE IDEA OF GETTING INVOLVED IN THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA BUSINESS. THIS IS OUR ACTUAL DISPENSARY WHERE WE HAVE ALL THINGS MEDICINE. THERE'S PRODUCTS FOR EVERYONE-- EDIBLES, DRINKABLES, CREAMS. AS YOU CAN SEE NOW, THIS HAS BECOME AN INDUSTRY. THESE ARE VERY WELL DONE, PROFESSIONALLY MADE PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THIS PRODUCT HERE, IT'S CALLED BAGEL BITES, AND IT IS BASICALLY PIZZA DOUGH WITH MEDICINE IN IT, AND SOME, YOU KNOW, SESAME SEEDS, AND STUFF LIKE THAT. TWO OF THESE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR VERY EFFECTIVE MEDICATION. I WOULD AGREE WITH SMOKING NOT BEING THE BEST FORM OF MEDICATION, YET IT'S THE ONE THAT'S MOST BROADLY KNOWN AND IS THE FASTEST. ANY KIND OF EDIBLES THAT NEED TO BE CHEWED TAKE ABOUT 30-45 MINUTES TO BECOME EFFECTIVE. HERE IS AN INTERESTING PRODUCT. UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE OUT RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN SEE HOW POPULAR IT IS. IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH BREATH MINT STRIPS-- I THINK EVERYBODY MIGHT KNOW ABOUT THAT-- THIS IS THE PRODUCT THAT WILL NOT ONLY GIVE YOU MEDICATION, BUT IT WILL GIVE YOU NICE FRESH BREATH. IT'S A PEPPERMINT PRODUCT, YOU CAN TAKE IT IN A PLANE. YOU CAN TAKE IT ANYWHERE YOU GO. YOU CAN GO TO CHURCH AND MEDICATE. YOU HAVE COMPLETE PRIVACY. THEN WE HAVE OUR SELECTION OF FLOWERS. AT THE MOMENT, WE HAVE 21 FLAVORS. IT'S BASICALLY THREE TYPES OF CANNABIS. SATIVA AND INDICA ARE THE TWO PREVALENT KINDS THAT WE HAVE, AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN WOULD BE CALLED A HYBRID. THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR PEOPLE TO FIND OUT WHAT WORKS FOR THEM. THIS IS HOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO PACKAGE THIS UP-- OUT OF SIGHT, WITH CLEARLY LABELED STAPLED BAG CLOSED UP. ON THIS LABEL ITSELF ARE THE DRUG EFFECTS. I NEED TO POINT THIS OUT, HOW STRICT THIS IS. "WARNING, KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN. PROVIDING TO OR ALLOWING A MINOR TO TAKE POSSESSION OF CANNABIS IS A FELONY-- PENAL CODE 273. FOR MEDICAL USE ONLY. WARNING, THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS A CHEMICAL KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER. WARNING, MAY BE HABIT-FORMING OR DANGEROUS TO CHILDREN. CONSULT WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN." SO, WE TAKE EXTREME STEPS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE WELL-INFORMED WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. THE IDEA BEHIND THIS PACKAGING IS THAT THE PATIENT TAKES THIS. IT'S HIDDEN. HE CAN PUT IT IN HIS POCKET, WHEREVER. AS SOON AS HE GETS IN HIS VEHICLE, THIS IS SUPPOSED TO GO INTO THE TRUNK OF THE VEHICLE AWAY FROM THE DRIVER SO HE CAN GO HOME, TAKE THE MEDICATION. IF HE WOULD BE STOPPED, THE PATIENT WOULD SHOW HIS DOCTOR RECOMMENDATION, AND THAT WOULD BE NOTHING MORE THAN, "ON YOUR WAY, SIR," FROM THE POLICE. WE'RE LOCATED IN A PART OF CALIFORNIA KNOWN AS THE INLAND EMPIRE. THIS REGION OF CALIFORNIA HAS DONE REALLY GOOD AT KEEPING THESE MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES OUT. BUT IT'S BECAUSE OF PARENTS AND TEACHERS AND PRIESTS AND BISHOPS-- PEOPLE JUST COMING TOGETHER GOING, "WE'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED IN L.A. AND SAN FRANCISCO." I TELL PEOPLE, "LOOK AT L.A." L.A. IS A CITY THAT WE DON'T WANT TO BECOME. SO, FOR ME, SURE, I'VE BEEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, LIEUTENANT COMMANDER IN THE MILITARY, SERVED IN IRAQ, WORKED IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR SIX YEARS. PUT ALL THAT ASIDE. WHAT DO I CARE ABOUT MOST? I'M A DAD, AND I GOTTA FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY THREE KIDS HAVE GOT A STATE WORTH GROWING UP IN. MANY AREAS OF CALIFORNIA HAVE LITERALLY GONE TO POT. [ODUM] IN SOME WAYS, IT'S MICKEY MOUSE'S FAULT. BECAUSE BACK WHEN EPCOT CENTER GOT DEVELOPED DOWN AT WALT DISNEY WORLD IN THE LATE 1970s, THEY SHOWED HYDROPONIC FARMING, WHICH WAS INTENDED TO SHOW THAT WE COULD GROW OUR OWN CROPS ON OTHER PLANETS WHERE WE DIDN'T HAVE EARTH SOIL. OBVIOUSLY, SOME OTHER PEOPLE FIGURED THAT OUT AND IT BECAME THE WAY TO GROW MARIJUANA. AND THEN THROUGH GENETIC ENGINEERING, AND HYBRIDIZATION, AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF TECHNIQUES THAT WE'VE USED IN GIANT AGRICULTURE, MARIJUANA HAS BECOME EXTREMELY POTENT-- SOME WOULD SAY 15-20 TIMES MORE POTENT THAN IT WAS 30 YEARS AGO. ALL RIGHT, WELL, HERE IS-- HERE IS A GROW ROOM. THIS IS LIKE A CLASSIC EBB AND FLOW SYSTEM. HERE'S THE BASIC SETUP. THIS IS WHAT YOU WOULD NEED TO REPLICATE A GROW LIKE THIS. IN THE BED ITSELF, THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT WE USE. IT'S ROCKWOOL-- IDEALLY MANUFACTURED FOR THIS PURPOSE OF GROWING HYDROPONICALLY. YOU WOULD STICK YOUR CLONE IN HERE, THE ROOTS WOULD GROW INSIDE, AND AS THE WATER FLOODS AND EBBS, NUTRIENTS GET PROVIDED TO THE ROOTS. AND IT GOES UP AND DOWN SEVERAL TIMES A DAY DEPENDING ON PREFERENCE. IN ORDER FOR US TO BE MORE EFFICIENT AND LESS EXPENSIVE ON ELECTRICITY, WE HAVE THESE TRACKING LIGHTS. AS YOU SEE, THEY MOVE AT A VERY SLOW RATE, AND THEY GO BACK AND FORTH, AND BACK AND FORTH. AND WHAT THAT DOES IS THAT ALLOWS US WITH THE SAME WATTAGE TO HAVE LESS SHADOW AND CREATE DENSER GROWTH. ALL THE PLANTS WILL GROW TO A CERTAIN HEIGHT, AND THEN WE SWITCH TO A SHORTER DAYTIME CYCLE. IN NATURE, AS THE DAYS GET SHORTER PLANTS TEND TO FINISH THEIR LIFECYCLE, SO THEY WANT TO REPRODUCE. THE REPRODUCTION, OR THE PART THAT WE CALL THE FLOWER, IS THIS PART HERE. THIS IS THE ACTUAL FLOWER PART. YOU CAN SEE THE HAIRS. THE HAIRS HAVE STICKY STUFF WHICH IT WOULD ATTRACT MALE POLLEN. SINCE WE DON'T PROVIDE MALE POLLEN, THIS WILL GROW BIGGER AND BIGGER, AND IT WILL PROBABLY COME UP TO THIS SIZE AND WILL BE FULL OF RESIN. IF YOU WILL-- YOU MIGHT SEE THE FIRST AMOUNTS OF RESIN. SEE, THIS HAS A LITTLE BIT OF DUST RIGHT THERE ON HERE. AND IF I WOULD RUB MY FINGER ON IT AS I DO, IT HAS ALREADY THE DISTINCTIVE ODOR OF THE FINISHED PRODUCT. THESE CURL, USUALLY, UP A LITTLE BIT. AND YOU TRIM ALL THAT OFF, AND THIS WOULD BE THE FI-- IF YOU IMAGINE ALL THIS STUFF GONE OR SNIPPED AWAY, THIS WOULD BE WHAT THE BUD WAS, BUT 10 TIMES AS BIG. AND THAT WOULD BE THE MARIJUANA. MY HANDS ALREADY GETTING STICKY. THAT IS THE SUBSTANCE THAT WE GO AFTER. THIS HERE IS A CARBON FILTER WHICH FILTERS THE AIR. ALL THE AIR FROM IN HERE GETS SUCKED INTO HERE AND GETS EXHAUSTED OUT THROUGH THIS INTO THE PLENUM, WHERE IT GETS SUCKED OUT OF THE ROOF. IT'S DOUBLE-FILTERED, SO THAT HELPS US TO BE DISCRETE. WE ARE SENSITIVE TO OUR NEIGHBORS. WE DON'T WANT TO BOTHER THEM WITH SMELL. IN GENERAL, IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE THE PLACE SMELL LIKE "ARABIAN NIGHTS." ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. WE'RE TRYING TO BASICALLY-- WE DO IN 10-12 WEEKS WHAT NATURE TAKES 6, 7, 8 MONTHS. IT'S LIKE ANY AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT. THE DIFFERENCE IS WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH OUR OWN RESOURCES. UP TO A FEW YEARS AGO, IT WAS VERY HARD TO COME UP WITH NEW-- EVERYBODY HAD TO INVENT THEIR OWN STUFF, MAKE THEIR OWN NUTRIENT SOLUTION. NOW, EVERYBODY HAS PICKED UP ON IT, AND IT'S LIKE THE SHOVELS FOR THE GOLD RUSH. IT'S EVERY INVENTION IT TAKES TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. [MALE ANNOUNCER] IN 1848, "GOLD" WAS THE WORD FOR CALIFORNIA. IT LURED MEN IN AN EXPLOSION OF MIGRATION FROM THE ENDS OF THE EARTH WITH PICK, PAN, LONG TOM, AND CRADLE. GOLD WAS THE KEY THAT UNLOCKED THE STOREHOUSE OF WEALTH THAT LAY BEHIND THE SIERRA BARRIER. [SABET] THERE'S CLEARLY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BE MADE IN MEDICAL MARIJUANA. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERY DISPENSARY'S MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, BUT CERTAIN MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES MAKE UPWARDS OF MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR PROFIT. [CHABOT] THE MARIJUANA INDUSTRY IS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY. YOU'VE GOT THE DOCTORS MAKING MONEY. YOU'VE GOT THE MARIJUANA SHOPS THAT ARE ELABORATE ORCHESTRATED BUSINESSES, WITH THESE "BUD TENDERS" GIVING 20 DIFFERENT STRAINS OF MARIJUANA TO SO-CALLED PATIENTS. MILLIONS, MILLIONS, MILLIONS. I MEAN, I'M LOOKING AT MY OWN PLACE. WE PAY, ROUGHLY, I'D SAY PROBABLY $60,000-$80,000 IN SALES TAX A YEAR. THAT'S JUST ONE PLACE, AND WE'RE A RELATIVELY SMALL PLACE. SO, YOU'RE LOOKING AT HUNDREDS OF OTHER PLACES. IT'S AMAZING. I BELIEVE THAT OFFICIALLY, THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GOT $100 MILLION IN TAXES. NOBODY ELSE GETS TAXED AS HEAVY AS THAT. YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER, 10,000 MARIJUANA STORES IN CALIFORNIA, EVEN IF WE KNOW IT'S WRONG, WE WANNA TURN IT BACK, WE'RE GOING UP AGAINST BIG MONEY. THEY'RE GIVING MONEY TO ELECTED CANDIDATES, TO DISTRICT ATTORNEYS THAT ARE TAKING THE MONEY. HOW DO I COMPETE AGAINST THAT? WE ARE ALWAYS AT THE LOSING END OF THE MONEY ISSUE. [FILE] PEOPLE ARE MAKING MONEY HAND OVER FIST. UNFORTUNATELY, A LOT OF POOR PATIENTS CANNOT AFFORD TO ACCESS THE PRICES, WHICH ARE OFTEN STREET PRICES OR HIGHER AT THE DISPENSARIES. [SABET] WE HAVE TWO MARIJUANA-BASED PILLS ON THE MARKET FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS. ONE'S CALLED MARINOL. ONE'S CALLED SESAMIN. THOSE ARE THC DERIVATIVES. AND THERE ARE ISOLATED COMPONENTS IN CANNABIS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE OUT, SYNTHESIZE INTO MUCH BETTER RATIOS, AND DELIVER IT IN A PILL, A PATCH, AN INJECTION, ET CETERA, IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T HURT THE LUNGS AND IN A WAY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO INHALE SMOKE. CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR PUT MARIJUANA UNDER PROPOSITION 65. CALIFORNIA, THE LIBERAL, NUTTY STATE THAT WE ARE, HAS SAID THAT SMOKING MARIJUANA CAN CAUSE CANCER. SCIENTIFIC PANELS AROUND THE WORLD UNANIMOUSLY HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT SMOKING IS A TOXIC DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE REALITY IS THAT WE HAVE LEGITIMATE MEDICATIONS THAT DO THE EXACT SAME THING WITHOUT ALL THOSE NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS. THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF GOOD THINGS THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. I MEAN, ONE YOU CAN THINK OF IS PENICILLIN. POLIO VACCINES. THESE HAVE SAVED COUNTLESS LIVES. ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY ARE FACELESS CORPORATIONS, AND FOR THEM THESE MEDICINES ARE A COMMODITY AND THE PEOPLE THAT USE THEM ARE CONSUMERS. THEY'RE NOT QUITE HUMAN BEINGS. IT'S A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS. IT'S JUST AS SIMPLE AS THAT. [VALERIE] AND MULTI-NATIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL CORPORATIONS ARE COMING ON THE SCENE FULL STRENGTH AHEAD, FULL TILT, TO TAKE OVER THIS INDUSTRY. WHY? BECAUSE IT'S A SIX AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR INDUSTRY, THAT'S WHY. [FILE] WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH PLANT-BASED MEDICINE, THERE'S A LOT OF INTERACTIONS THAT NOBODY REALLY EVEN KNOWS. AND SO WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE A PIECE OUT OF IT, LET'S TAKE OUT THE THC, LET'S TAKE OUT THE CBD, AND LET'S MAKE IT IN A LAB, YOU LOSE A LOT. [SABET] THERE IS SUCH THING AS MEDICAL MARIJUANA. IT'S ISOLATED COMPONENTS OF THE CANNABIS PLANT DONE IN A WAY THAT'S RESPONSIBLE AND IS LABELED AS SUCH, NOT GOING DOWN TO THE NEON-LIT DISPENSARY ON THE CORNER BY 7-ELEVEN AND FIND SOMETHING CALLED PURPLE HAZE WITH A 400-POUND BOUNCER NEXT TO YOU WATCHING OVER YOUR PURCHASE. THAT'S NOT MEDICINE. HEY, WELCOME TO WEEDMAPS. WEEDMAPS WAS STARTED IN AUGUST OF 2008 BY ME AND MY FRIEND KEITH, WHO'S A DEVELOPER, A FRIEND OF MINE FOR A LONG TIME. WE WERE AT A RESTAURANT, FELIX'S CONTINENTAL CAFE IN ORANGE COUNTY. WE'D JUST GOT OUR MEDICAL MARIJUANA CARDS, BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO. WE HEARD ABOUT A COUPLE PLACES, A COUPLE DISPENSARIES, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW. SO, WE BASICALLY MADE A WEBSITE FOR OURSELVES JUST TO SHOW, SEE A MAP, AND PLOT ALL THE DISPENSARIES, YOU KNOW, NEAR YOU, WHICH WAS KIND OF NOVEL AT THE TIME. NOBODY WAS DOING THAT. THIS IS KIND OF OUR GAME ROOM, WE GOT A PING-PONG COURT OVER HERE, WHICH I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT, BUT THEN WE HAVE THE FOOSBALL TABLE OVER THERE, WHICH I AM VERY GOOD AT. A FEW PAPER DINOSAURS GUARDING THE BALLS, OF COURSE. IT WAS PROBABLY ABOUT 60 DAYS INTO IT IS WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT TRAFFIC-- AND I HAD DOZENS OF OTHER SITES, BUT THE TRAFFIC CURVE ON IT WAS ONE OF THOSE "EXPEDIENTIAL" VIRAL TYPE OF CURVES THAT YOU WANT TO SEE ON YOUR SITES THAT YOU NEVER REALLY DO SEE. I JUST KNEW THAT EVEN THOUGH THE TRAFFIC WAS RELATIVELY SMALL, MAYBE A COUPLE HUNDRED HITS A DAY, I KNEW THAT THE POTENTIAL WAS HUGE. AND THEN RIGHT HERE IS AN AREA THAT WE CALL THE WEEDMAPS "CENTRALE," WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO MIMIC AN AMSTERDAM STYLE COFFEE SHOP IN EXPERIENCE AND ATMOSPHERE. JANUARY 2010 WAS THE DAY WE DECIDED TO START CHARGING CUSTOMERS. AND THEN WE JUST TOOK OFF FROM THERE. THE PRICING MODEL STUCK, THE PATIENTS LOVED THE SITE. THE SERVICES THAT THE SITE PROVIDES, LIKE MENUS, AND PRICES, AND THC PERCENTAGE TESTING, CBD PERCENTAGE TESTING, FUNGICIDES, PESTICIDES-- I MEAN, SO MANY THINGS THAT I NEVER THOUGHT WERE POSSIBLE BACK IN 2008 WHEN I STARTED IT ARE NOW NOT ONLY POSSIBLE, IT'S EXPECTED. LAW ENFORCEMENT, KNOCK ON WOOD, WE'VE NEVER HAD ANY TROUBLE WITH THEM. WE'VE HAD SOME VERY PUBLIC ISSUES WITH SOME PUBLIC COMPANIES, ACCOUNT SEIZURES AND MERCHANT ACCOUNT FREEZINGS, JUST BECAUSE IN THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS. IT'S NOT FEDERALLY LEGAL YET. T-MOBILE EFFECTIVELY SHUT DOWN OUR SHORT CODE, WHICH WAS WHAT WE WERE USING TO SEND OUT DAILY DEALS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. AND ONE DAY T-MOBILE OUT OF THE BLUE DECIDED TO SHUT DOWN OUR THIRD-PARTY PROCESSOR THAT WAS PROCESSING OUR TEXTS BECAUSE OF A UNCLEAR VIOLATION OF TERMS OF SERVICE. THAT WAS JUST ONE OF THE MANY IMPEDIMENTS THAT THIS COMPANY HAD STARTING UP. THE LAST PIECE TO OUR OFFICE HERE IS THE WEEDMAPS TV STUDIO. WE'RE JUST KIND OF SETTING IT UP. IT'S STILL A LITTLE DIRTY, BUT I'LL GIVE YOU GUYS A SNEAK PEAK. WE PUT THIS SOUND INSULATING FOAM IN SO PEOPLE CAN'T HEAR ME SCREAM. AND, YEAH, WE GOT A LITTLE GREEN SCREEN GOING ON. HOPEFULLY, WE GET SOME PRETTY GOOD USE OUT OF THIS THING. IT WAS PURCHASED IN THE MID-NINETIES. AND WEEDMAPS IS AS OF TODAY THE PROUD OWNER OF THAT DOMAIN, AND WE'RE GONNA BE INTEGRATING IT WITHIN OUR WEEDMAPS NETWORK OF SITES. [MAN] IN ANY PROFESSION YOU HAVE, YOU LIKE TO MAKE LIGHT OF THINGS. YOU CAN'T TAKE THE JOB TOO SERIOUSLY. SO, THE PICTURES IN HERE, LIKE THE ONE YOU WERE FILMING, OR THE ONE THAT "WUZZAP?", IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, HUMOR. LIKE THE SIGNS YOU SEE UP HERE, THE CODE OF HONOR, DUDLEY DO-RIGHT'S-- YOU USE TO TRY TO MAKE YOUR JOB FUN AND INTERESTING. THE JOB IS STRESSFUL, SO YOU CAN TRY TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF HUMOR INTO IT. [ST. PIERRE] AS MODERN AS CALIFORNIA IS, AS CONGESTED AS THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE AND THE BAY AREA IS, THE NORTHERN PART OF CALIFORNIA, PARTICULARLY THE WESTERN MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS LEADING TOWARDS THE COAST, ARE ALMOST OFF THE GRID. IF YOU ARE NOT ON A MAJOR ROAD IN THAT REGION, YOU HAVE NO CELL PHONE COVERAGE UNTIL YOU GET TO A TOWN. THIS IS ABERRATIONAL THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE UNITED STATES. IT WAS ALWAYS ON THE FRINGE, AND ALWAYS, ALWAYS IN OUTLAW STATUS. AMERICA'S DOMESTIC MARIJUANA INDUSTRY HAPPENS TO BE IN THE NORTHERN PART OF CALIFORNIA. HUMBOLDT, TRINITY, AND MENDOCINO COUNTIES, THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE, THE EMERALD TRIANGLE, HISTORICALLY, HAS BEEN PRODUCING THE BEST AND PROBABLY THE MOST AMOUNT OF MARIJUANA IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE WINE INDUSTRY IN AMERICA IS TOTALLY DOMINATED BY CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE PHYSICAL REGION GROWS THE PRODUCT THE BEST. [HANSON] MARIJUANA GROWING IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY CAME TO THE FOREFRONT ABOUT 1983, WHEN WE HAD A SPIKE IN MURDERS AND HOMICIDES, I THINK WE HAD 28 THAT YEAR FOR A POPULATION OF 130,000 PEOPLE. PEOPLE STARTED GROWING OUTDOORS. ONE PLANT'S WORTH ABOUT $3,500, AND SO IT BEGAN THE MODERN-DAY GOLD RUSH, JUST LIKE 1849. I KNOW WHERE I LIVE, THE GUY BEHIND ME GROWS, BECAUSE I CAN SMELL IT. SO IF A GUY'S GROWING DOPE, AND HE KNOWS I'M THE DETECTIVE SERGEANT RUNNING THE MARIJUANA PROGRAM, IT'S PRETTY COTTON PICKIN' RAMPANT, I THINK. WHEN THE MARIJUANA ISSUE STARTED, IT STARTED IN OUR SOUTHERN AREA WE CALL GARBERVILLE. MARIJUANA ENCOMPASSES THE WHOLE COUNTY OF HUMBOLDT NOW, AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE OFFICERS WHO ARE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE MARIJUANA ISSUE WITH 130,000 PEOPLE. OUR MAIN FOCUS IS ON LARGE-SCALE COMMERCIAL GROWERS. IF I GET INFORMATION FROM AN ANONYMOUS SOURCE THAT SAYS THAT JOHN DOE IS GROWING 100 PLANTS AT HIS HOUSE, I WON'T EVEN TARGET THAT GUY. I WON'T ARREST ANYBODY, I WON'T TAKE ANY PLANTS. TOO SMALL OF AN OPERATION. [WOMAN ON RADIO] WHAT IS THE LOCATION? [RADIO CHATTER] THIS IS A MARIJUANA GROW WE FOUND IN AN EASTERN PART OF OUR COUNTY. IT WAS ON TIMBER COMPANY PROPERTY AND U.S. FORREST SERVICE PROPERTY, WHICH IS VERY REMOTE AND ISOLATED. THESE BIG CLUMPS HERE, THAT'S ALL MARIJUANA. THEY LOOK LIKE LITTLE PUFF BALLS. THIS IS A DIFFERENT ANGLE AT THE SAME HILLSIDE. YOU CAN SEE HOW TALL THE TREES ARE IN COMPARISON TO ALL THESE DOTS. THIS IS ONE GROW COMPLEX, BUT WE HAD ABOUT 10 OF THEM OUT THERE IN DIFFERENT AREAS ALL INTERCONNECTED WITH TRAILS. NO ROAD SYSTEM INTO IT. IT'S ABOUT A TWO-MILE WALK FOR THE MARIJUANA GROWERS TO GET IN THERE AND YOU CAN SEE HOW RUGGED IT IS. IT TOOK US FOUR DAYS TO GET THE MARIJUANA OUT OF THERE, AND WE HAD ABOUT 20 POLICE OFFICERS CUTTING IT DOWN. WE SEIZE A TOTAL OF 133,000 MARIJUANA PLANTS. FOR THE STATE, IT'S UP TO AROUND FOUR MILLION PLANTS SEIZED A YEAR NOW. LAST YEAR, THERE WAS SEVEN SEPARATE OFFICER-INVOLVED SHOOTINGS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, SO IT'S VERY DANGEROUS OUT IN THE HILLS. IN OUR COUNTY IN 2007, ONE OF OUR DEPUTIES WALKED INTO A MARIJUANA GROW AND IT WAS AN ILLEGAL HISPANIC IN THE GROW THAT POINTED A SHOTGUN AT OUR DEPUTY, AND OUR DEPUTY SHOT AND KILLED HIM. HE WAS AN ILLEGAL, DEPORTED ABOUT FOUR MONTHS EARLIER AND CAME BACK IN OUR COUNTY AGAIN, AND OUR DEPUTY ENCOUNTERED HIM AND HAD TO USE LETHAL FORCE. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE 14 OPEN HOMICIDE CASES IN A COUNTY OF 138,000. AND WHY? PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE LUCRATIVE ASPECTS OF AN ILLEGAL MARIJUANA TRADE. AND WHAT I HAVE IN MY COUNTY IS AN ILLICIT TRADE, AND AN INDUSTRY, AN ILLICIT INDUSTRY, THAT ARE OPERATING IN A PARALLEL. AND I LOVE HUMBOLDT COUNTY. I LOVE THE PEOPLE HERE IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY WITHOUT ANY RESERVATION. THE SAD THING IS THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE PEOPLE IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY AGAINST THE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA THEN FOR IT. AND, WELL, I SAY SADLY, BECAUSE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE AGAINST THE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE GROWING MARIJUANA. THEY DON'T WANT IT TO BECOME LEGAL BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THE PROFIT MARGIN TO DISAPPEAR. BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES IT PROFITABLE IS IT BEING ILLEGAL. WE'VE BECOME MARRIED, BOTH TO THE MARIJUANA INDUSTRY AND TO ITS CRIMINALITY. AFTER PROP 215 PASSED IN 1996, THESE AGRARIAN COMMUNITIES WENT FROM BEING TOTALLY ILLEGITIMATE TO SEMI-LEGITIMATE. THE MEXICAN NATIONALS HAVE ALSO FIGURED OUT THAT THEY CAN TAKE A PART OF THIS BUSINESS. THEY HAVE COME HERE AND STARTED THEIR OWN MARIJUANA CULTIVATION. [HANSON] PEOPLE COME ALL THE WAY UP HERE FROM MEXICO TO GROW BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO GROW IN CALIFORNIA, THAN TRYING TO SMUGGLE IT OVER THE BORDER. IT'S EASIER TO BRING THE PEOPLE UP HERE AND THEN GROW ON OUR OWN NATIONAL LANDS LIKE FOREST SERVICE, NATIONAL PARKS. [GALLEGOS] YOU JUST DRIVE THEM UP INTO THE HILLS, AND YOU SAY, "HEY, YOU'RE GONNA BE HERE FOR A COUPLE MONTHS. WE'LL COME UP PERIODICALLY AND BRING YOU FOOD, WATER. AND THEN WHEN IT COMES HARVEST TIME, WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY, AND LET YOU GO." SOMETIMES THEY DON'T DO THAT. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT JUST DECIDE, YOU KNOW, "OH, I'LL JUST KILL MY LABORERS. NO ONE KNOWS THEY'RE HERE. THEY DIDN'T TELL ANYONE THEY WERE HERE. ALL I HAVE TO DO IS KILL THEM AND ROLL THEM DOWN A HILL. THIS IS A RURAL AREA. THE ANIMALS WILL MAKE SHORT WORK OF IT." THEY'RE HERE ILLEGALLY. THEY'RE EASY TO ERASE. WHO'S GONNA KNOW ABOUT THEM? IT'S NOT LIKE THEY TELL THEIR FAMILY WHERE THEY'RE AT. THEY HAVEN'T HAD PHONES, BECAUSE ONCE THEY SHOW UP, THEIR PHONES ARE CONFISCATED. SO, THE FAMILY KNOWS THAT THEY'RE UP THERE SOMEWHERE. WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO? CALL THE POLICE? "YEAH, MY FAMILY MEMBER WHO WAS UP THERE GROWING MARIJUANA, I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE AT." WE HAVE A CASE, A YOUNG MAN WHO'S FROM MENDOCINO COUNTY CAME UP HERE TO GROW, HAD THREE PEOPLE WORKING UP THERE, DECIDED THAT IT WAS-- YOU KNOW, A BULLET WAS CHEAPER THAN PAYING THEM. [GUNSHOTS] SHOT AND KILLED ONE. SHOT ANOTHER ONE THROUGH THE FACE WHO HAPPENED TO LIVE AND IS NOW ONE OF OUR WITNESSES. THE OTHER GUY HE DIDN'T KNOW WAS THERE. HE RAN OFF. I MEAN, I HAVE STORIES LIKE THAT THAT I COULD TELL YOU IF YOU SAT HERE FOR 24 HOURS WITH ME. [CHABOT] IF YOU LOOK AT THIS IN THE UNITED STATES, MOST CRIME IS DRUG-RELATED, SO WHAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS AS MUCH AS PEOPLE MIGHT THINK MARIJUANA IS A BENIGN SIMPLE DRUG, IT IS ATTACHED TO A VERY VIOLENT INDUSTRY WHICH IS IN IT JUST FOR THE MONEY. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO LEARN AS A SOCIETY. WE HAVE MURDER CASES IN THIS COMMUNITY WHERE NEIGHBORS WHO KNOW ABOUT IT, BECAUSE THEY'RE INVOLVED IN THE MARIJUANA INDUSTRY, DON'T ASSIST LAW ENFORCEMENT IN FINDING THE MURDERERS. SOMETIMES THEY KNOW WHO THE MURDERERS ARE AND THEY STILL DON'T HELP US. HOW MUCH MORE PERVERSE CAN YOU BE? [HANSON] I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S GETTING WORSE BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY. EVERYBODY WANTS TO GROW MARIJUANA TO MAKE MONEY. THERE'S A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO BE MADE. THE LIBERAL LAWS THAT YOU REALLY DON'T GET INTO MUCH TROUBLE FOR GROWING MARIJUANA. BASICALLY IF YOU GET CAUGHT IN THE COUNTY OF HUMBOLDT, SAY, WITH 1,000 MARIJUANA PLANTS, THE FIRST TIME YOU'RE CAUGHT, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STATE PRISON. YOU GET PUT ON PROBATION, YOU WORK ON THE WEEKENDS. YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN SERVE ANY TIME IN JAIL. YOU'LL BE IN TROUBLE AND CONVICTED OF A FELONY, BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STATE PRISON FOR THE FIRST TIME. SO, PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO TAKE THAT RISK. [CARROL] THERE'S A SMALL MAJORITY OF THE POLITICIANS IN URUGUAY THAT WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO START CULTIVATING MARIJUANA AND SELLING IT TO THEIR POPULATION, BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THAT BRINGS VIOLENCE, AND HIGHER PRICES, INSECURITY TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. AND THEIR FEELING IS THAT IF THEY WERE TO CULTIVATE IT AND SELL IT TO THOSE PEOPLE IN URUGUAY THAT ARE ALREADY MARIJUANA SMOKERS, THEY CAN BASICALLY KILL THE BLACK MARKET THAT WAY. INSTEAD OF FIGHTING THEM WITH GUNS, INSTEAD OF ARRESTING THEM, JUST ERASE THE ECONOMIC INCENTIVE. [CHABOT] WHATEVER WE DO, THE CARTELS ARE GONNA ADAPT. THEY'RE ORGANIZED CRIME SYNDICATES. THESE ARE VERY RESILIENT ORGANIZATIONS. THEY'RE NOT IN IT JUST FOR THE DRUGS, THEY'RE IN IT FOR THE MONEY. AND WHEREVER THEY CAN FIND A MEASURE TO MAKE MONEY, THEY WILL. THE CARTELS DON'T JUST SMUGGLE MARIJUANA. THEY DO HEROIN, COCAINE, METHAMPHETAMINE, DVD SMUGGLING, THE HUMAN SMUGGLING, THE WEAPON SMUGGLING. I SPENT 10 YEARS WORKING ON MY DOCTORAL DISSERTATION ON DRUG CARTELS. I KNOW THESE GUYS VERY, VERY WELL. IT'S NOT ABOUT JUST THE DRUGS. IT'S ABOUT THE MONEY. [SABET] TO THINK THAT WE WOULD NECESSARILY IN ONE FULL SWOOP GET RID OF THE UNDERGROUND MARIJUANA BUSINESS IS VERY NAIVE. THERE'S GONNA BE AN INCENTIVE FOR THESE BUSINESSES TO STAY IN PLACE. THEY'RE IN PLACE NOW. THEY'RE ENDEMIC. TO THINK THAT THEY'RE GONNA GO AWAY JUST 'CAUSE CALIFORNIA IS GONNA LEGALIZE MARIJUANA MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE. SO, URUGUAY IS, TO ME, JUST AHEAD OF THE GAME. AND THEY'RE WILLING TO BASICALLY BUCK THE VOICE OF THE UNITED STATES IN THIS, BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES IS REALLY THE WORLDWIDE BULLY ON FORCING OTHER GOVERNMENTS OR TRYING TO PUSH OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE MARIJUANA AND OTHER DRUGS ILLEGAL, AND TO SET UP INCARCERATION RATES. I MEAN, YOU NAME IT. YOU NAME IT. [CHABOT] THE UNITED STATES, THROUGH OUR CONSTITUTION, HAS GOT SOMETHING CALLED THE TENTH AMENDMENT, WHICH IS STATE'S RIGHTS. WELL, THE UNITED STATES ALSO HAS SOMETHING CALLED THE SUPREMACY CLAUSE, WHICH MEANS THAT STATES CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT SO LONG AS IT'S NOT IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW. AND THE SUPREMACY CLAUSE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN VERY IMPORTANT TO THE UNITED STATES HISTORY. WHETHER IT WAS OVERCOMING SLAVERY WITH SOUTHERN STATES THAT WANTED SLAVERY, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAID NO. [ST. PIERRE] THE UNITED STATES IS LITERALLY CREATED BY THIS FRICTION BETWEEN THE STATE GOVERNMENTS AND THE AUTONOMY THAT THEY HAVE AS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE SUPREME COURT WAS SET UP TO RESOLVE DISPUTES BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH ARE PRACTICALLY RARE IN THIS COUNTRY. THE PRO-MARIJUANA PEOPLE THINK THAT BECAUSE CALIFORNIA PASSED THESE PROPOSITIONS THAT THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE. BUT THE FEDERAL LAW TRUMPS STATE LAW. IN A SENSE, CALIFORNIA WANTS MARIJUANA, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYS NO. IN THE UNITED STATES, THERE IS CLEARLY A TWO-TRACK SYSTEM. THERE IS LOCAL STATE LAW, AND 99% OF PEOPLE WHO GET ARRESTED FOR MARIJUANA GET ARRESTED AND CONVICTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. ABOUT ONE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION WHO GETS ARRESTED FOR MARIJUANA GETS BUSTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO GROWS MARIJUANA AND EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT SELLS MARIJUANA ARE BREAKING FEDERAL LAW EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY DO IT. THEY MIGHT HAVE THE AUTHORITY OF THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THEY MAY BE EVEN HAVING TO PAY 5% TAXES TO THE LOCAL OR STATE GOVERNMENT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN STILL COME IN THERE AND RAID THEM, AND STILL TAKE AWAY THEIR ASSETS, AND STILL TRY TO RAM THEM INTO A CAGE. SO, THAT IS WHAT IS SO CONFUSING TO SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY AND AROUND THE WORLD. AND WHAT REALLY DRIVES ME PERSONALLY CRAZY IS HOW SUBJECTIVELY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHOOSES TO ARREST AND PROSECUTE VERY, VERY, VERY FEW OF THE MEDICAL CANNABIS PROVIDERS. THEY ARE DOING IT, BUT IT'S VERY SUBJECTIVE. IT'S A BIG PROBLEM, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE OPERATE TOTALLY LEGALLY. WE COMPLY WITH ALL OF OUR STATE LAWS. AND WHEN WE WERE RAIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WE WERE IN TOTAL COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE LAW. THEY PUT A GUN TO MY HEAD-- ACTUALLY FIVE ASSAULT RIFLES. POINTED AT MY HEAD, SCREAMING AT ME TO "GET UP, GET UP, GET UP!" AND I'M PARALYZED, SO I COULDN'T GET UP. AND I TRIED TO POINT TO MY BRACES AND CRUTCHES NEXT TO THE BED WHICH COULD SCARILY ENOUGH LOOK LIKE WEAPONS BECAUSE THEY'RE METAL. AND I WAS TRYING TO PULL MY VENTILATOR OFF 'CAUSE I USE A BREATHING MACHINE AT NIGHT. AND THEY WERE TELLING ME TO PUT MY HANDS UP. IT WAS VERY, VERY SCARY, YOU KNOW, TO BE WOKEN UP AT GUNPOINT. AND I KNEW WHO IT WAS. I HAD PREPARED MENTALLY FOR THIS, BUT NO PATIENT SHOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHAT I WENT THROUGH, WHAT VALERIE WENT THROUGH. [ST. PIERRE] THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS MADE HUNDREDS OF RAIDS IN CALIFORNIA, OREGON, AND UNTIL VERY RECENTLY, WASHINGTON, ON INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE GROWING AND SELLING MARIJUANA. [SABET] LET'S BE VERY CLEAR HERE. WHAT YOU'RE DOING, MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PROFITING OFF OF MARIJUANA, GIVING IT TO ANYBODY WHO WANTS IT, MIXING IT IN WITH OTHER ILLEGAL DRUG BUSINESS, MIXING IT IN WITH YOUNG PEOPLE HAVING ACCESS TO IT, HAVING THEM BE ACROSS THE STREETS FROM SCHOOLS, ET CETERA, THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT PERMITTED UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND WE NEVER SAID IT WAS. AND NOW, GUESS WHAT. WE GAVE YOU TWO YEARS, BUT WE'RE NOW GONNA ENFORCE THE LAW. POLICE DEPARTMENT! SEARCH WARRANT! - OPEN THE DOOR! - [POUNDING ON DOOR] POLICE DEPARTMENT! SEARCH WARRANT! OPEN THE DOOR! - MOVE. MOVE. - HIT IT. [OFFICERS SHOUTING] [SABET] DO I WANT TO ARREST THE 85-YEAR-OLD GRANDMOTHER WITH SIX MONTHS TO LIVE, DYING A SLOW DEATH OF CANCER, WHO SMOKES MARIJUANA EITHER THROUGH A VAPORIZER OR THROUGH CIGARETTES THAT SHE OBTAINS? AND DO I THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD USE OF LAW ENFORCER RESOURCES? OF COURSE NOT. NOBODY THINKS THAT. AND THAT PERSON ISN'T BEING ARRESTED. EVERYBODY SAYS, "OH, THEY DON'T WANT TO COME AFTER PATIENTS." WE'RE GOING AFTER THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MAKING MONEY OR NOT COMPLYING. BUT IT'S NOT TRUE. THEY STILL DO GO AFTER PATIENTS. AND THEY STILL DO GO AFTER PEOPLE WHO ARE COMPLYING. AND AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THIS TENSION BETWEEN THE FEDS AND THE STATES, IT'S GONNA KEEP HAPPENING, BECAUSE THERE'S PEOPLE THAT WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT BASED ON THEIR OWN PERSONAL BELIEFS. [HARTFIELD] PERSONALLY, I NEVER GREW UP IN THE INNER CITY, BUT MY FRIENDS THAT DID GROW UP IN THE INNER CITY, THEY CAN TELL YOU THAT IT'S A WHOLE OTHER SCENARIO WHEN YOU'RE THERE, BECAUSE ONE OF COMMON WAYS TO GET RICH AND MAKE IT OUT OF THE GHETTO IS TO SELL DRUGS. AND THE ONLY REASON WHY THAT WORKS IS BECAUSE THERE'S A PROHIBITION ON DRUGS DRIVING THE PRICE OF DRUGS INCREDIBLY HIGH. CONSEQUENCES OF PROHIBITIONS ARE ALWAYS THE SAME. THE VIOLENCE SKYROCKETS AND THE DRUG USE GETS HARDER AND HARDER. WHEN YOU MAKE IT ILLEGAL, IT TURNS EVERYTHING UNDERGROUND. IT FUELS THIS ENTIRE BLACK MARKET ECONOMY WHICH IS RULED BY VIOLENCE, AND PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIT SMALLER AND SMALLER QUANTITIES INTO MORE AND MORE POTENT DOSES, SO IT'S EASIER TO TRANSPORT. THE MORE YOU CRACK DOWN ON SOMETHING, THE HARDER THE DRUGS BECOME. IT'S CALLED THE IRON LAW OF PROHIBITION. [ST. PIERRE] DURING ALCOHOL PROHIBITION IN AMERICA, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 700,000 AMERICANS HAD A PRESCRIPTION TO POSSESS A CASE OF BEER OR TWO GALLONS OF WINE EVERY DAY. ONE HAS TO ASK ONESELF, WHAT MEDICAL USE IS THERE FOR ALCOHOL? THE ALCOHOLISM RATES BEFORE PROHIBITION WERE APPROXIMATELY 10 PERCENT. THERE'S SEVERAL STUDIES THAT LOOKED AT PROHIBITION ALCOHOLISM RATES AT 25 PERCENT OR HIGHER. SO, IF WE MADE IT ILLEGAL, WHY DID THE DRINKING RATE GO UP SO MUCH? [CHANTING] WHENEVER YOU TRY TO LEGISLATE BEHAVIOR, ESPECIALLY IN AMERICA, WE HAVE AN OPINION THAT SAYS, "DON'T TELL US WHAT WE CAN'T DO. AND IN FACT, IF YOU TELL US WE CAN'T, WE'RE GOING TO DO IT." LOOK AT PROHIBITION. SO MANY PEOPLE DECIDED THAT WE NEEDED TO MAKE ALCOHOL ILLEGAL, THAT WE DID. AND IT BLEW UP IN OUR FACE, ALTHOUGH IT TOOK US 13 YEARS TO FIGURE IT OUT. FOR GOD'S SAKES, IT CREATED THE MAFIA. [ST. PIERRE] MARIJUANA PROHIBITION HAS BEEN SO EXTREME IN THIS COUNTRY COMPARED ALCOHOL PROHIBITION. ALCOHOL PROHIBITION, THE ONLY THING THAT WAS ACTUALLY ILLEGAL WAS YOU SIMPLY COULDN'T POSSESS ALCOHOL AND THEN TRY TO SELL IT TO ANOTHER PERSON. MARIJUANA PROHIBITION IS SO EXTREME. YOU CAN'T POSSESS IT. YOU CANNOT GROW IT. YOU CANNOT USE IT AS A RELIGIOUS SACRAMENT. YOU CANNOT USE IT AS A MEDICINE. AND EVEN MORE TO THE EXTREME, REGARDING MARIJUANA COMPARED TO ALCOHOL, FARMERS CAN'T EVEN GROW THE NON-PSYCHOACTIVE STRAIN FOR INDUSTRIAL CROPS. OF COURSE, I AM DELIGHTED, BUT NOT SURPRISED, BY THE FINAL REPEAL OF THE 18TH AMENDMENT. I'VE FELT ALL ALONG THAT WHEN THIS MATTER WAS PROPERLY SUBMITTED TO THE RANK AND FILE OR OUR PEOPLE, THEY WOULD READILY SEE THAT IT HAD NO PLACE IN OUR CONSTITUTION. IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, TO ESTIMATE THE BENEFIT THAT WILL COME TO THIS COUNTRY FROM THE LESSONS TAUGHT TO THE COMING GENERATIONS TO MAKE IT THEIR BUSINESS TO SEE THAT NO SUCH MATTER AS THIS IS EVER AGAIN MADE THE SUBJECT OF FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. [MAN] MARIJUANA IN GENERAL IN CALIFORNIA IS FINE WITH ME. SOME PEOPLE NEED IT MEDICINALLY, CLEARLY. THE BENEFITS ARE-- THERE'S DATA TO BACK UP THE BENEFITS OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA. I'M FINE WITH IT. I'M ACTUALLY FINE WITH IT EVEN NON-MEDICINALLY. WEED'S NOT DANGEROUS. IT'S CERTAINLY NOWHERE NEAR AS DANGEROUS AS ALCOHOL CAN BE. AS A RECREATIONAL DRUG, CANNABIS IS INCREDIBLY SAFE. IT'S INCREDIBLY THERAPEUTIC. AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ALCOHOL? IT SEEMS TO MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. TO ME IT'S NOT AN ISSUE ABOUT COMPARING DANGERS OF ALCOHOL VERSUS MARIJUANA. YOU CAN TAKE ANY DRUG AND SAY IT'S NOT AS DANGEROUS AS ALCOHOL AND YOU'D PROBABLY BE RIGHT. IT MAY MAKE PEOPLE CRAZY TO THINK THAT, "HEY, I CAN SMOKE MARIJUANA AND I FEEL MUCH BETTER THAN I DO WHEN I DRINK ALCOHOL. I GET MUCH MORE VIOLENT WHEN I DRINK ALCOHOL VERSUS MARIJUANA." BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY OF CONCERN. WE HAVE TWO LEGAL DRUGS THAT CAUSE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ADDICTION AND SOCIAL COSTS AND HEALTH COSTS. WHY WOULD WE CREATE ANOTHER INDUSTRY LIKE THAT? IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME. HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE ON WEED? HOW MANY PEOPLE GET ENRAGED AND BEAT UP THEIR HUSBAND OR WIFE OR KIDS ON WEED? I DON'T THINK THAT'S EVER HAPPENED IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY. [SABET] YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT TODAY'S MARIJUANA ISN'T THE MARIJUANA THAT YOUR GRANDFATHER MIGHT HAVE SMOKED. IT'S NOT THE MARIJUANA THAT WAS ALL ABOUT PEACE, LOVE AT WOODSTOCK. A LOT OF THE MARIJUANA IN THE UNITED STATES IS INDOOR GROWN. IT IS MANIPULATED SO THAT THE THC CONTENT, SO THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT, WHAT GETS YOU HIGH, IS ACCENTUATED. AND THE OTHER INGREDIENTS, WHICH ACTUALLY HAVE A COUNTER-BALANCING EFFECT ON THE THC-- AN INGREDIENT LIKE CANNABIDIOL, OR CBD-- IS ENGINEERED IN A WAY SO ITS EFFECTS ARE REDUCED. AND THAT WAY YOU GET A BETTER HIGH, BUT ALSO THAT BETTER HIGH TRANSLATES INTO BIGGER HEALTH HARMS. ONE OF THE MORE SURPRISING THINGS THAT PEOPLE LEARN WHEN THEY HEAR ABOUT THE PROCESS OF ADDICTION, IS THE FACT THAT THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE THAT GETS YOU HIGH THAT YOUR BRAIN DOESN'T ALREADY MANUFACTURE. ALL WE'RE DOING WHEN WE USE DRUGS IS WE ARE DISPLACING WHAT'S ALREADY THERE WITH OTHER CHEMICALS. WHEN WE PUT THOSE CHEMICALS INTO OUR BRAIN, THE END RESULT IS OUR BRAIN STOPS MAKING THE SAME AMOUNT OR THE SAME TYPE OF CHEMICALS BECAUSE WE'RE BRINGING IT IN FROM OUTSIDE. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN THE HIGH BETWEEN DIFFERENT KINDS OF DRUGS BASED ON THEIR PROPERTIES. THE MOST EXTREME DRUGS ARE THE STIMULANTS. COCAINE AND METHAMPHETAMINE TEND TO BE THE ONES THAT CAUSE THE MOST DAMAGE BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO BE ADDICTIVE VERY QUICKLY. MARIJUANA DOESN'T HAVE THAT SAME INTENSITY TO IT, BUT FROM A NEUROTRANSMITTER PERSPECTIVE, IT'S STILL LOCKING OUT THE BRAIN'S NATURAL NEUROTRANSMITTERS. THERE'S PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE AND THEN THERE'S PSYCHOLOGICAL DEPENDENCE. AND YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE IN ORDER TO HAVE AN ADDICTION. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, MARIJUANA EFFECTS CANNABINOID RECEPTORS IN YOUR BRAIN, IF OFFSETS THE NATURAL ONES THAT WE MAKE, AND YOUR BRAIN NEEDS THOSE CHEMICALS IN ITS NATURAL AMOUNTS, AND IT'S NOT MAKING THEM ANYMORE BECAUSE YOU'RE PUTTING THEM IN. THAT CREATES A PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE. YOUR BODY GOES THROUGH A WITHDRAWAL WHEN YOU'RE NOT SMOKING IT. NOW, THIS IS FOR REGULAR SMOKERS. IT'S NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO SMOKE ONCE A MONTH. [DANOVITCH] WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS FOR MARIJUANA, PROBABLY MOST SIMILAR TO NICOTINE WITHDRAWAL IN TERMS OF INTENSITY. THEY'RE NOT AS SEVERE AS THE WITHDRAWAL YOU SEE WITH ALCOHOL OR WITH OPIOIDS. THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT LIFE-THREATENING. IN ORDER WORDS, IT'S NOT GONNA KILL YOU. IT'S NOT MEDICALLY DANGEROUS, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY UNCOMFORTABLE AND IT CERTAINLY SUSTAINS CONTINUED USE. [ODUM] WHAT WE KNOW IS FOR PEOPLE WHO DRINK OR USE SUBSTANCES, ADDICTIVE PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS, MARIJUANA, APPROXIMATELY ONE IN TEN ARE GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM. IN OTHER WORDS, NINE PEOPLE CAN USE IT JUST FINE, BUT THAT TENTH PERSON, IT CREATES A PROBLEM IN HIS OR HER LIFE. IT BEGINS TO CAUSE SERIOUSLY NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. [DANOVITCH] WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARIJUANA INDUSTRY AND MARIJUANA CULTIVATION AND PREPARATION, THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF FORMULATIONS OF THC THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AT INCREDIBLY HIGH CONCENTRATIONS. AS INDIVIDUALS GET INTO HIGHER AND HIGHER POTENCY FORMULATIONS OF THC, THEY TEND TO GET MORE SIGNIFICANT WITHDRAWAL PHENOMENOLOGY. I HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL THAT I WAS SEEING RECENTLY THAT WAS TAKING A DISTILLATION OF MARIJUANA OIL WHICH WAS 70 TO 80 PERCENT THC-- INCREDIBLY HIGH CONCENTRATIONS-- AND USING A QUANTITY OF IT THAT WAS GIVING HIS BODY THC EXPOSURE THAT YOU COULD NEVER GET TO BY SMOKING MARIJUANA. YOU JUST COULDN'T SMOKE THAT MUCH, IF YOU SMOKED ALL DAY. THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS HAVING REALLY SEVERE WITHDRAWAL PHENOMENA, WITHDRAWAL PHENOMENA THAT REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN WELL-CHARACTERIZED AMONG PEOPLE THAT JUST SMOKE MARIJUANA. [ODUM] NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, WHETHER IT'S MADE LEGAL OR NOT, THERE ARE CERTAINLY PEOPLE WHO ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE EXTREMELY OBSESSIVE ABOUT THINGS AND COMPLETELY OVER THE TOP. THE YOUNGER YOU START, THE MORE LIKELY IT IS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE ADDICTED. KIDS WHO START USING DRUGS OR DRINKING BEFORE AGE 15 ARE FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE ADDICTED THAN KIDS WHO WAIT TILL THEY'RE 16. IT'S THAT MUCH OF A SENSITIVE TIME IN THEIR LIFE. THAT MAY HAVE EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT THERE'S A FOREST OF NEURONS IN YOUR BRAIN, AND IT'S GETTING MAPPED OUT AS TIME GOES BY, AND IT'S GROWING AND DEVELOPING, AND IF YOU LAY DOWN ADDICTIVE MEDICATIONS INTO THE HARDWIRING, THEN IT'S MUCH MORE LIKELY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT THAN IF YOU LAID DOWN CALCULUS ABILITY AND TRIGONOMETRY FIRST AND THEN SMOKE ON TOP OF IT. SO, MAYBE WAIT A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE YOU START DOING THAT KIND OF STUFF. MARIJUANA IMPACTS THE ENDO-CANNABINOID SYSTEM IN THE BRAIN. THAT'S A NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEM THAT'S VERY INVOLVED IN BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN THAT HAVING HEAVY EXPOSURE TO MARIJUANA DURING THE PHASE OF LIFE THAT WE'RE HAVING MAXIMAL BRAIN DEVELOPMENT, AND THAT IS DURING YOUTH, IS NOT A GOOD THING. A CONSISTENT AND GROWING SET OF DATA AND STUDIES WHICH SHOW THAT THERE ARE SUBTLE BUT SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS AND LONG TERM EFFECTS ON THE QUALITY OF COGNITION AND BRAIN FUNCTION AMONG INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO HEAVY AMOUNTS OF MARIJUANA EARLY ON. THERE'S SO MUCH MISINFORMATION FROM EVERY SIDE THAT IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE COULD ACTUALLY HAVE FACTS. UNFORTUNATELY, EVERY TIME A STUDY COMES OUT THAT SAYS SOMETHING POSITIVE ABOUT MARIJUANA, ANOTHER ONE COMES OUT THAT SAYS SOMETHING NEGATIVE. SO, IT REMAINS MURKY AT BEST. WE REALLY NEED TO BE DOING NEW RESEARCH [NIXON] HELLO, NEIL AND BUZZ, I'M TALKING TO YOU BY TELEPHONE FROM THE OVAL ROOM AT THE WHITE HOUSE, AND THIS CERTAINLY HAS TO BE THE MOST HISTORIC TELEPHONE CALL EVER MADE. IN ALL OF MY YEARS IN OF PUBLIC LIFE... [DU PONT] WELL, I GOT INVOLVED WITH THE DRUG ISSUE IN THE LATE 1960s THROUGH CONCERN ABOUT CRIME IN THE NATION'S CAPITOL IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AND THAT WAS BEING DRIVEN BY A HEROIN EPIDEMIC. WHEN I CAME TO THE WHITE HOUSE, PRESIDENT NIXON SAID TO ME I WAS THE EXPERT ON DRUGS AND NOT HIM IN ALL WAYS BUT ONE, AND THAT WAS ABOUT MARIJUANA. WITH RESPECT TO MARIJUANA, HE HAD DETERMINED THAT HE WOULD AND HIS ADMINISTRATION WOULD OPPOSE MARIJUANA DECRIMINALIZATION. IF I SHOWED ANY SIGNS OF FAVORING DECRIMINALIZATION, I WAS GONE. AND I GOT THE MESSAGE, AND IT WAS VERY EASY FOR ME TO ACCEPT THAT BECAUSE MY FOCUS WAS HEROIN ADDICTION. I WASN'T PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN MARIJUANA. I THOUGHT IT WAS TRIVIAL. I DIDN'T CONSIDER IT TO BE A VERY SERIOUS DRUG ISSUE AT THE TIME. I BLAME NIXON. NIXON ACTUALLY WAS THE ONE WHO CRIMINALIZED MARIJUANA, HE SAW IT AS A WAY TO ATTACK THE ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT, MOSTLY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE EXPERIMENTING WITH DRUGS. IT WAS A WAY FOR HIM TO BE ABLE TO ARREST PEOPLE AND PUT THEM IN JAIL AND A WAY TO ATTACK THE COUNTER CULTURE. I THINK THAT IT'S REMAINED THAT WAY BECAUSE IT STILL IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR ATTACKING THE COUNTER CULTURE. [MALE NARRATOR] THIS IS THE STRAIGHT SOCIETY. THE ORDERLY, WELL-MANAGED, WELL-DISCIPLINED WORLD OF THE ESTABLISHMENT. [DU PONT] IN 1974, NIXON WAS GONE AND NOW WE'VE GOT GERALD FORD IN. I WAS THE HEAD OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE AT THAT TIME AND THE WHITE HOUSE DRUG PERSON. AND GERALD FOLD HAD NO QUALMS ABOUT DECRIMINALIZATION, SO I WAS QUITE FREE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR DECRIMINALIZATION, AND THAT MADE ME SOMETHING OF A HERO WITHIN THE PRO-DRUG GROUP AT THAT TIME. OVER THE COURSE OF MY TIME IN THE GOVERNMENT, MARIJUANA USE EXPLODED, AND WE GOT TO A POINT WHERE ONE IN NINE AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS WERE SMOKING MARIJUANA EVERY DAY. I REGRETTED THIS NEW SOFTER LINE WHEN I BECAME CONCERNED ABOUT IT. I HAD TRIED FOR YEARS, TRIED TO SAY MARIJUANA IS A PROBLEM, BUT I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE ARRESTED FOR MARIJUANA. I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE A CRIMINAL VIOLATION. I NEVER SAID I THOUGHT MARIJUANA WAS A GOOD THING-- USING MARIJUANA. I THOUGHT FROM A HEALTH POINT OF VIEW, IT'S A BAD THING. I WOULD ALWAYS SAY THAT, BUT WHAT'S REALLY STRIKING ABOUT IT IS EVERYTHING I SAID WAS WAS EXPERIENCE-- UNDERSTOOD AS EITHER, PRO-POT OR ANTI-POT. THESE DISCRIMINATIONS I WAS MAKING COULDN'T BE TRANSLATED. THE MEDIA IS A BIG FACTOR IN THIS, BUT NOT BECAUSE OF ANY MALICIOUSNESS, BUT BECAUSE THE MEDIA IS RESPONDING THROUGH THE AUDIENCE. THE MEDIA MAKES ITS MONEY BY HAVING EYES. YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF EYES, YOU GET A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY. YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF EYES, YOU GET A LOT OF MONEY. IT'S NOT HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHY THEY GO THE DIRECTION THEY DO. YOU'D SAY, "BALANCED," YOU KNOW, "NUANCED," TO USE THE TERM. "COMPLEX." OH, NO. YOU'RE THIS SIDE OF THE LINE OR YOU'RE THAT SIDE OF THE LINE, AND ANYTHING ELSE DOESN'T MATTER. YOU HAVE TO BE YES OR NO. IT HAS TO GO ON A BUMPER STICKER OR YOU CAN'T PLAY THIS GAME. GUN CONTROL, ABORTION, IMMIGRATION. EACH OF THOSE THINGS, IS PHENOMENALLY COMPLEX. AND IT COMES DOWN TO ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF ABORTION OR ARE YOU AGAINST IT? ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF GUNS OR AGAINST GUNS? I MEAN, IT IS MADDENING, BUT IT'S EVERYTHING. HONEST TO GOD, THAT'S THE WAY THE GAME GOES DOWN. AND THAT'S WHEN I SAID, OKAY, I'VE GOTTA MAKE-- THERE'S A LINE HERE. I GOTTA BE ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER. AND THE SIDE I NEEDED TO BE ON FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH POINT OF VIEW WAS TO DISCOURAGE MARIJUANA USE. I COULD NOT FAVOR DECRIMINALIZATION AND GET THE MESSAGE ACROSS THAT MARIJUANA WAS A PROBLEM. IT WAS A BRIGHT LINE THAT TO COMMUNICATE I HAD TO BE ON THE CORRECT SIDE, OR THE ANTI-MARIJUANA SIDE, TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT MESSAGE ACROSS. [MARGOLIN] THERE'S NO LAW THAT'S GOING TO MAKE MARIJUANA GO AWAY, PERIOD. WE HAVE DRACONIAN LAWS, THAT PROVIDED FOR INCARCERATION FOR MANY YEARS FOR MARIJUANA CASES. IT DIDN'T WORK. IT'S JUST-- IT'S SHOCKING TO ME. IT'S A MYSTERY TO ME WHY IT REMAINS AS IT DOES IN THE VEIN THAT IT'S ILLEGAL. TO CALL A PLANT A CRIME JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A RATIONAL WAY TO DEAL WITH IT, AND I THINK WHEN WE WENT DOWN THIS PATH, IT'S BEEN IRRATIONAL AND A GREAT DETRIMENT TO SO MUCH OF OUR COUNTRY AND SO MUCH TO PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN IT AND AROUND THE WORLD. [SABET] WE DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN EXTREME POLICIES. THAT'S THE ISSUE AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH OUR CURRENT DIALOGUE ON MARIJUANA TODAY. WE'RE PRESENTED WITH TWO POLICY SOLUTIONS. ONE, ENFORCEMENT ONLY. ONE, LEGALIZATION. THAT'S NOT HOW THE REAL WORLD WORKS. THERE ARE PRACTICAL REASONS WHY SOMEBODY SHOULD CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE. ANYBODY LOOKING DISPASSIONATELY AT THE DATA WOULD SAY, "THIS IS AN ISSUE WE SHOULD LOOK AT AND WE SHOULD MONITOR AND WE SHOULD CARE ABOUT." FRANKLY, THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE WAY TO DEAL WITH IT IS TO PREVENT IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. [GALLEGOS] I'M NOT AN ADVOCATE FOR MARIJUANA, IT'S NOT MY LIFESTYLE. I'M NOT ADVOCATING ITS USE, AND I CERTAINLY DON'T WITH MY KIDS. WHAT I DO ADVOCATE IS RATIONAL GOVERNMENT POLICIES. WHAT I SEE IS MURDERS ASSOCIATED WITH MARIJUANA. BECAUSE OF THE VALUE OF IT, BECAUSE WE'VE CRIMINALIZED IT, WE HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING KILLED OVER IT. THAT'S A TREMENDOUS INDIVIDUAL COST AND A TREMENDOUS SOCIETAL COST. I AM PERSONALLY FOR LEGALIZATION, AND I AM A STATE OFFICER WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS TO ENFORCE THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHETHER I AGREE WITH THEM OR NOT. [ODUM] I'VE BEEN AROUND AND WORKED WITH HUMAN BEHAVIOR LONG ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT LAWS IN SOME CASES ARE PRETTY SECONDARY, AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DO WHAT THEY DO WHETHER IT'S LEGAL OR ILLEGAL. WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUESTION OF AM I FOR IT OR AM I AGAINST IT? I SIMPLY LOOK AT IT AS A THERAPIST. I'M PREPARED TO DEAL WITH WHATEVER THE OUTCOME IS AND HELP PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE ABOUT WHAT'S BEST IN THEIR OWN LIVES REGARDLESS OF WHAT A LAW MIGHT SAY. [ST. PIERRE] ONE OF THE HARDEST JOBS AT NORML HAS BEEN TO GO OUT TO THE MARIJUANA GROWING AND SELLING COMMUNITIES TO ASK THEM TO VOTE FOR LEGALIZATION. WITH LEGALIZATION, THERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME PEOPLE DISPLACED WHO HAD BEEN GROWING IT AND SELLING IT. AND THAT'S THE DIFFICULTY OF LOOKING SOMEBODY IN THE EYE AND SAYING, "WILL YOU VOTE AGAINST YOUR OWN SELF INTEREST?" PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE ASKING THEM TO VOTE AGAINST THEIR OWN ECONOMIC INTEREST. UNLESS THAT PERSON HAS A LARGER WORLD VIEW OR A GREATER APPRECIATION OF THE HUMANITY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE, THEN IT'S A LOT EASIER FOR THEM TO BE SELF-INTERESTED AND SELF-CENTERED, BUT THAT'S NOT AN ARGUMENT, FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, TO CONTINUE WITH ANOTHER 80 YEARS OF PROHIBITION. I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT ONCE THE UNITED STATES ENDS MARIJUANA PROHIBITION, A GOOD PART OF THE REST OF THE WORLD IS GOING TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION FAIRLY QUICKLY. [CHABOT] LESS THAN 10% OF CALIFORNIA CITIES NOW ALLOW FOR MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES. THAT NUMBER'S SHRINKING. SO, I'D SAY WE'VE GOT SOME GREAT VICTORIES. BUT IT'S LIKE THE OLD HORROR MOVIES. ONCE YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT THE BAD GUY DOWN, RIGHT? YOU PUT THE AXE IN ITS HEAD AND YOU TURN YOUR BACK AND YOU START WALKING, WHAT HAPPENS? THE MONSTER GETS BACK UP AGAIN. THIS IS NEVER A PROBLEM THAT IS JUST GOING TO GO AWAY COMPLETELY. IT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE THERE. WHICH IS WHY WE AS HUMAN BEINGS ALWAYS HAVE TO BE THERE FOREVER. [DU PONT] THE PROBLEM, REALLY, IS FOR THIS SOCIETY IS TO COME TO TERMS, NOT JUST WITH MARIJUANA, BUT WITH THE USE OF DRUGS THAT PEOPLE WANT AND PAY FOR, AND HOW TO DEAL WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY PROBLEMS THAT THAT CREATES IN A WAY THAT'S COMPATIBLE WITH OUR LAWS, WITH OUR VALUES, WITH A CONCERN ABOUT CARING ABOUT PEOPLE.
