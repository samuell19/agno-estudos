- Where I live, only dogs run wild - Don't worry. You'll sleep like a baby now. I have to... I have to sleep... I have to sleep... This is the motherfuckers' position. You coming? - Yes. You two stay here, and shoot anything that moves, got that? On three, I go right, and you go left. - On three. Hey!!!! What's up with you?!?! Have you flipped?!?! What happened to me? - Wild Dogs - Come here... I missed you so much! - Asshole! I'm running late for work. I have to go. It's too late. Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry. It was absolute hell. You can't imagine what went on there. Nadav called me in, in the middle of a meeting with a client, and if it wasn't Shadmi's son, they would've fired me long, long ago... Yes, so why aren't you fired? Stop it. I'm late for work. I've got to go. Come on... Let's have a quickie... I'm not ovulating... - Excellent. Finally, we'll do it for fun... Oh, shit! - What? I forgot to put the ice cream in the fridge. Talma? - Huh? I missed you. You're such a softy. I'll be right back. He may look young, but let him fool you. It's not his first time on a case like this. He worked with advocate Weiss on a very similar case, on the Shadmi case, and if he's good enough for Shadmi... - Which Shadmi? The... hotels Shadmi? - The hotels Shadmi, the tankers Shadmi, arms... Mr. Carmi... - Dalia! I said not to disturb us now, okay?! But it's an urgent call for Uri from Nadav Shadmi... Excuse me... Yes, Nadav. In half an hour. All right, bye. What's up? How's Li'ora? I'm under interrogation. The case went to M.P. Investigations. They're all over me. Are you saying that as a friend, a lawyer? What? As a friend that was with me in elementary school, high-school, officers' school, Gaza, and in that shack in the village. They'll reach you. The old man spilled the beans. He said I shot the two fuckers, after they had their hands up, and that I shot his grandson and killed him. The old man's telling the truth. - Uri, you know me... You know what a big difference there is between us and the dicks at General Staff who control national morality through documents and letters. They didn't see Uzi going into the house, and coming out headless... Shimon and Guri tied up inside the house, with a bullet in their heads and cut dicks. They'll reach you. Omri and the old guy said that you were with me all the time, and that you saw everything. I saw everything. And they'll ask you what you saw. What you say can determine everything. I want to stay in the army, Uri... I think it's important, that it's a Zionist thing, that I'm a good officer. I think you know that. I think you know how things really happen. - Nadav, drop it. Stop... You're the best soldier I know, and don't let them fuck with your head with talk about "war criminals". You're no Himmler, nor do you look like one. If they ask me what happened there, I'll tell them what I saw. Excuse me! Does this bag belong to anyone? Does this bag belong to anyone? Driver! - What? What? Driver! Stop the bus, please! Stop the bus. Excuse me... excuse me... Get out of the way... Open the door! Can't help it. The insurance will cover it. Your cut is 15,000 shekels. See you later. Can you see anything? - No sails on the horizon. Don't worry, some day, the ship will come. Good morning, Robinson and Crusoe! Friday! I'm Friday! Wonderful, Friday... Tell me now, is your sister up? - No. In 5 minutes, you're to swim from this island to school. Here, Come on, get up! The sewing factory's all stressed out! Darn you. I was just in the middle of the dream I like. Everything was so white and beautiful... People were beautiful... Wore beautiful clothes... and everything was covered with snow, a whole lot of snow around... - "Gute Morgen" "Ich gei ach schlaffen". Hey, Nathan. - I didn't forget the globe. - Cool, thanks. Good morning, Mrs. Siton. How are you? We've come to take grandpa. There are a few documents that have to be signed. Where's Eli? - He's sleeping. He worked last night. And Amalia, where's she? - Went to the sewing factory. Shall I go wake him? Good morning, State Comptroller, what can I do for you? - Good morning Eli, sorry for waking you... I know you worked late, but we've come to take grandpa. And mother needs some help with the paperwork. - "Ja, mein Dame!" It says here, that you agree to take grandpa down from the tree, and to let them take him to a place where he can play backgammon with the rest of the old folks, until he dies. Sign here. And here. Good. - What about Nathan? - What about him? Are we having a sale? Come, Mr. Siton. We've come to take you to a better place. Don't you have any welfare for me? Why don't we climb the tree, so you can take me down to the Hilton? Why? I thought you're really successful with the Civil Guard, aren't you? If it was any better, we'd go crazy! But, actually, if everything turns out well with Nathan and grandpa, I'll be out of here in a month. I'm done with the Middle East... Why, where would you go, Eli? - Hamburg! In a month from now, I will rule Hamburg! - Why Hamburg, Eli? Because they have law and order there, culture... They're punctual there, hardworking... Every sentence there ends with "Danke schoen", "Bittes choen..." Or "Schnell", or "Achtung..." - See what I mean? There's nothing here... "Aufwiedersehen..." "Aufwiedersehen" Amalia, beautiful Amalia... I've missed you so... The sea missed you, even the sun and clouds... they ask where's my Amalia? Stop it... lay off, Haim. I've... got to work now. - Good for you! Hard work. Why don't you come to the shack, to rest, and have a good time... Nothing compares to a nice cup of coffee at sunset. - Lay off, Haim! I'm saving money to study a profession. So lay off, will you?! - Why are you talking this way? I worry for you. I miss you. I haven't seen you for 3 months! Without the memory of you, how do you think I'd last in this stinking shithole? Come on, Amalia. You know how much I love you... Who loves you more than I do... - No one! Fuck you... And this is a piece by the young and talented Amalia Siton, the up and coming prodigy in the art world, who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, and despite the hardships, managed to get into Israel's leading fashion design college and finish her studies with honors... Let's hear it for Naomi Campbell, in a collection by Amalia Siton! Earth to Amalia... What's up with you, Amalia? Will you stop daydreaming? How many of these have you done? You better start working faster! You've done half of what the others have! You don't want half a salary, do you? You don't, do you? Go on, back to work! I'll bet she hasn't been touched by a man for like 700 years! - Totally! She should be a warden or something. Did you see how she enjoys it? I'm fed up with this. It's terrible. What can I do? How will I get money for that course? Why don't you let him give you a ride home? Sarah, you're so clueless. Really! - I'm clueless? You are. This guy's crazy for you! Sister, this is... You don't find love like this... It's like Hollywood... I don't understand how you can give that up, and he's a hunk too! Really... How's my princess? How's my beauty? Why don't you step into the car? I'll take you wherever you need to go... Like my bride needs... - Okay, I'm getting out of here. What's Amalia's beautiful friend's name? Sarah. - Sarah? Such a beautiful name... It's from the bible... Do you know who Sarah was? Of course you do. I could tell right away that you're an intelligent one. Say, Sarah... You're a good friend of Amalia's, aren't you? Could you, perhaps, do me a little favor? You don't have to worry. You can trust me. Come closer to the car, won't you? I want to show you something... Wow! Where did you get that? It's for you. Haim asked me to give it to you. He said he has a lot more of these for you. He said... he'd give them to you if we came to his place after work today... He really wants us to go to his place. You'll come, won't you? Can I get you girls a tanning bed? I'm knocking half a day's wages off both of your salaries. And this is staying with me, until further notice. Just imagine... what it would be like ending every day like this... Chilling out... Letting nature take over your body... Going all the way with it... Where did you get this? This must have cost you a fortune! It's a designers' book! It's really professional! You see, I really want you to study and develop. I just hate seeing you working at that factory... I don't think that my princess should work in that kind of a place... He's so cute... Where did you find him? - Oh, you know... where I find them all... There's no shortage of strays here. I want you to come back. For good. To stop working in that stinking factory... I want you here. To take care of me, and I'll protect you. Like things used to be. I don't want things to be like they used to, Haim... I want to study. I want to do something with my life. Of course you'll do... do something... my beauty, my princess... you'll be my wife. You'll make me children. I don't just want to have children! I want to study, I want to have a career! You'll have a career! You know that your having a career is important to me. I want that. Soon... Soon... Soon, my beauty, soon we'll be able to. Soon... You'll be my wife, won't you? Well? How's my sea? Words cannot describe how... your sea is full of sea... Want me to help you dry your back? Go play another disc... In a minute... I... actually like the quiet. I told you to go now, so go now. But what shall I play? I never find anything back there. Put that disc on, go on... the one I like. The romantic one... What are you doing? Giving you a good time. Ow! Why are you doing that? I thought we'd love a little... - Love a little? That we'd play... - That we'd play? I gave you everything... music, sea, sun... All I'm asking for is a bit of attention from your body. What are you doing? A kiss, at least... A kiss? I'm not a Mezuzah, am I? Tell me that you love me, at least. I love you, I love you, of course I love you. Not that one! Then, I don't know where it is. Which disc do you mean? - You know exactly which one I mean. Our disc. With our song... When we met... "Who loves you more than I do..." Are you sure it's here? I can't find it. It's there. It's there. Look good... Maybe... under the couch... May I? Of course you can. It's the last time I go third. No! Stop! Stop! Stop! Come, my pretty thing. Sleep now. I feel that Nathan's wavering between imagination and reality. If I send him to boarding school, and Eli leaves Israel... Well? - The family's gone... - Eli, Eli, Eli... You spend all day with that Eli. I think you're in love with that Eli. I'm not in love with him, but I definitely appreciate what he's done with his life. Making completely different choices would have been much, much easier where he comes from. Look, despite all his Nazi bullshit, he does volunteer work with the Civil Guard, he takes care of his broken family. I think that should be appreciated, don't you? Come on... Where are you going? Hold on. We have to wait a minute. Nothing. Just nothing. Your romanticism will be the end of me. Not only have I been waiting for some stick to tell me that my wife can have sex with me for the last hour, you've also been telling me about the romance in your work... What can I tell you... This ovulation method will make me impotent! At least I'm telling you what I'm going through. You haven't told me anything for a month. Why did you come in so late last night? Fuck! I'm not answering that. Forget it. I want you... Maybe it's important? I think it's important... Stop... We have all night, don't we? The ophthalmologist is one flight down, Dr. Pessach. I'm looking for Talma. Could you tell her Amalia's here? It's important. Hold that, hold that. Put that there. Darling, could you do me a favor? Could you get me the sheets from the closet? They're up in the... I know exactly where the sheets are. Well, ladies. I'll leave you on your own, to chat a little. Tomorrow morning... I like my coffee black, with milk, two sugar, and two slices of toast, buttered. All right? And don't wake me up before 9 A.M., because I'm a lawyer, and I need at least 8 hours of sleep. Otherwise, I can't function at the office. Right? - Yes. Good night. Don't worry about the eye. We'll give you sunglasses, movie star sunglasses... Thanks... Bye. - Bye. You have such an amazing husband... So why did you go to his place, eh? Didn't you know that would happen? He said he... he'd pay for my studies, that I won't have to go back to the sewing factory... I'm worried for Sarah. I left her there. She was high as hell. - I'm going to send the police over there, I'm telling you! But you can't send the police over. Sarah's there. She's 19. They'll arrest her. Her father will skin her, if you send the police over. She only went there because of me. Go to sleep now. Thanks. Uri, Uri... Good morning. Good morning. It's 9. You took it seriously, didn't you? Of course. Wow. Thanks! Is that all right? - Yes. I'm... it's better. You sure? How old are you? Um... 17. Yes. Is that final? Are you studying anything? I went to school until I was 14. Until Haim. Haim. Last night's Haim? Haim's... always been around. I met him about 4 years ago. I loved him... he was my idol. He told me that only he could raise me properly. He kept me for the wedding. He wouldn't let anyone else touch me. Even he wouldn't touch me... He'd hold back... But... Every so often new girls would come around and... he'd get them high, and... make them feel good, and then he and Yefet and Yunes... would have sex with them. Most of them became their whores. You probably think I'm a whore, don't you? I really don't. I think you're beautiful, and you've got a beautiful head... which knows exactly what's going on and how it's going to end, and yet you're going smack into the wall. Is that what she said? Hey, congratulations. - Congratulations. How are you? - Great. What's up? - Congratulations. Thank you very much. So what did you tell her? I told her to be careful, otherwise, we'd make her other eye black as well... Azulai? - You know it... My wife isn't straight... You know it... I was glad to meet you. You know that... "My wife isn't straight either..." Shadmi wants to speak to you. Come. Hello. How are you? - Fine, fine. - You look wonderful. Thanks. No, no, no. I quit... Thanks. Oh yes, I forgot. You two did that together as well. Such a shame Nadav started smoking again. But he'll quit... You won't say no to this... Listen Uri, I'm not going to bullshit you, because I don't like when people bullshit me... and also because I respect you. But, I think you don't realize the meaning of what you're going to do. I've known you for a long time. A long, long time. I don't think that you're capable of ruining your best friend. You're asking me to do the one thing I can't do. Not for Nadav, or for anyone... I'm willing to die for him, I'm willing to take the blame, I'm willing to say that I saw that he was unstable, that... you know what? I would even volunteer to take on his case. Even if I have to leave the firm because of it, but this is something I can't do. I can't do it, Shadmi. You know me. You know me well enough to know that I can't... I don't know you anymore, Uri... what's become of you? I don't remember you being such a stickler for justice in your compulsory army service. Not according to what Nadav told us. Which is also probably why he became unit commander over you. You couldn't keep your temper in check. That's what they called it, didn't they? If you ruin him, I'll ruin you. There'll be nothing left of you. Congratulations. Still letting dad clean up your messes, eh? We're going... Can I finish my drink? You wanted to get pregnant, didn't you? Are you going to talk to me? I'm talking to you. Keep your eyes on the road... Are you going to tell me what happened? Uri, I can't take it anymore. You've had this sour face for a whole month now. Talk to me! The state pays me to listen to other people's troubles, and my own husband can't tell me what he's going through?! Say, didn't we see that film already? You're really good at this, aren't you? Remember how Nadav called me in some time ago, and you got really pissed at me, because you were ovulating and you were planning a romantic evening? So... When I got there, the situation was pretty tough. The team had lost 3, and Nadav... I'd never seen him that way. He had lost it, completely. What do you mean by: "Lost it"? He shot two terrorists who were standing with their hands up, and a little boy, who was sitting by his grandfather. If I hadn't stopped him, he would have shot the grandfather as well. So Nadav called me 3 days ago, and asked to meet me somewhere, and told me that... there's an inquiry going on, and that... they would probably reach me too, and he asked me to "retouch" the... you know... what happened there... because if I didn't do that, they'd discharge him and put him in jail. What did you tell him? What do you mean: "What did I tell him"? I told him I'd tell the truth! And today, his oh-so-cute father let me know that if that's what I'm going to do, I can forget about my legal career in any western country around the world. You know Shadmi. What are you going to do? Isn't it obvious? What? Do you think I should lie? I think you should remember that they're going to crucify your best friend there, who grew up with you... - You're starting to sound like Shadmi, you know?! Uri, She's going to give birth in a month - He shot a little kid, do you realize that? He shot a little kid! Shot a little kid! - You're hurting me. Are you all right? Are you all right? - Yes. - Yes? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My sweet. I'm sorry... I love you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry... You're going to work early today. Yes. I have an important... meeting with a client. How are things in the office now? I have to run to... the meeting. Have you heard anything about Sarah? Last time I checked at the factory... she wasn't there. I'm afraid. He'll come... home or to the factory. I don't think I can deal with him. Don't worry. I'll think of something. We'll sort it out. And what happens until then? How long can I stay here? You guys have a life too, and... messes. I see what you're going through. What Uri's going through... Are you all right? - Yes. - Uri? Hi. He asked you to go see him, as soon as you came in. How are you? Ask me after I come out, okay? Okay. Okay... Hey Uri, good morning. - Good morning. Come, have a seat. You know, I've been thinking about it and I... I've decided that a young man like you shouldn't be wasted. I'm going to let you take care of all of Shadmi's cases. You're going to work hard, but you're also going to get a raise. And this will make me change my testimony? Forget it. I take it that Nadav's being accused of murdering hostages and a child... and you want to be a bleeding heart and tell the truth, as if you don't know that truth is never where one thinks it is. Listen. There may not be an interrogation. They haven't spoken to me... - They will speak to you!! And how!! You know very well that this whole cold-blooded murder thing... doesn't exist. This is war! This is not a courtroom. And war is what makes us strong, weak... about, maybe... cowardly, brave! It's crazy, it's madness! And you know that you don't judge madness! You don't judge madness! Can I make a phone call? Amalia, it's Uri. Great. Here's what I want you to do. Take this down, please. Are you writing this? Good. Take 8 tomatoes, nearly rotten in a noble way... Yes, in a noble way. When you can almost hear the juice screaming when it wants out. Okay, so what you do is take them and throw them in half a pot of boiling water... Amalia... throw them gently. You don't want to hurt the tomatoes' feelings. Nice. What you'll see is how the peel comes off the tomatoes. This is how tomatoes undress. We have all the rest. I'll be there. No, no, no... wine is my department. Please... I want you to focus on the tomatoes and... missing the chef... Yes, dear. All right. Bye. What do you think you're doing? - Making spaghetti. So that's what you want me to do now? To say that Nadav... was shell-shocked, that it wasn't him that shot them? Huh? That it was the wars that shot them? I'll tell the truth, Carmi. Not because of the left wing, or the Geneva Accord or Peace Now. Because of me. Because I don't know any other way to preserve my sanity. My sanity. Do you understand that? Are you even capable of understanding that? Ask me how I feel now. How do you feel? Like shit... Welcome, State Comptroller! Someone's in a bad mood... Can you tell me why? I was at the factory now. That forewoman is so obnoxious! Yes. Amalia says she's obnoxious too. What about Amalia? Didn't you notice That she hasn't been home for the past few days? She suffers here. She went somewhere where she suffers less. She went to Haim's shack. She got beaten up when she tried to get a friend of hers out of there. Don't worry. She's been at my place for a few days now. She's just afraid to leave the house. I'm thinking of talking to him. So you want to save the whole world? Is that it? You can't take everyone home with you. You have a gun? A gas gun. Looks real. From afar. We'll be all right, won't we? - Don't worry. Starting now, I'm taking care of your security. Eli, my man, what's up? Nice uniform... Who's the chick? You always score the best girls. Yefet, get us four beers, and start boiling some coffee. The sociological worker has come to visit... I'm honored... Really. I respect you. Taking care of a neighborhood that's not only bad, it's very bad. Coming to Tel-Aviv every day, to this cesspool, and to discover all these people, who've been forgotten, who've been passed over. It doesn't even have a name, this place. Yunes, what's up with the reefer? It's keeps getting wet because of this crappy paper... Give me some cardboard. This is Yunes. He got hit on the head when he was 10, and since then, everything about him has been growing... but his head... he's still 10 years old. Let me have the dope. May I? What have you done? What have you done? Go help Yefet with the beers. So to what do I owe the honor of your presence? Have you come to get me a job? I want you to leave Amalia alone. I don't want you to talk to her, I don't want you to call her... Don't you understand that I love her! That she's the love of my life. That she'll be my wife... so why are you meddling? Why are you meddling in things that are none of your business? Yefet! Can you make me a hit? I want you to let Sarah go. Do you think I'm keeping people here by force? Do you want to go? See? She doesn't want to. What do you want me to do? To make her go? To chase her out... To throw her out? That's what I want. I want you to make her, I want you to chase her out. Are the tomatoes ready? - I've peeled them. They're on the counter. How are you? Is Talma home? Great. Follow me, to the kitchen! Come on, come on... How was work? That's what you're supposed to ask me. How was work? Excellent! I got a raise, but I didn't accept it. Being a housewife suits you... Where? Do me a favor. Take her home. Now. - What are you going to do here? I don't want to! Come back in ten minutes. - Come on, sweetie. Staying here alone is dangerous! - I don't want to! Don't you realize that? Do me a favor. Go on, go on. Everything's fine. Is there anything else I can do for you? Because if there isn't, there's something I want you to do for me. Let's begin with the fact that I want you to tell me exactly where Amalia is. I can't tell you where Amalia is. And if you don't take your hand off of me right now, I'm calling the police again. - Why the threats? Why are you making me mad? Why do I have to show you that you won't be able to reach the police? You're making Haim do something to you now, which will make you not want to go to the police afterwards, because afterwards, there won't be anything left... Whatever you feel like. How are you? Go on, go at her. You can start, take some. No, I don't drink. - But I insist. Can I do her mouth? - Sure. It's shut hard. It's open now. Restrain yourself! - What? The spaghetti will get cold. Haim never let me smoke... He didn't think I should do those kinds of things. Where is she? - Who? Talma. The sociologist? - Yes. She left hours ago. - What do you mean: "She left"? She waited and waited for you, saw that you weren't coming, called a cab, and left. She told me to thank you, if you did show up. A nice girl, actually. The first sociologist they brought here who has a good head on her, and soul... Even before she left, she managed to call welfare... she got Yunes a job. He and Yefet are going... you're not going to believe this... to spend 3 weeks widening the entrance to the Great Synagogue. Do you know where she went? She went to visit some aunt in hospital... Ichilov hospital I think it was. Ichilov hospital. Well... So... Bye then. Bye. Now you understand that you can't threaten Haim Neuman with the police. And this, my dear... is your first lesson about wine. Smell... Hey! Right on time! Nothing like the second bottle. Long day at work, dear? I'll be right there. Talma... Have you eaten something bad? Go to sleep now. How about the idea that you and the girl beat her up and then pushed her out of the window, so it would look like a suicide? That's a crappy idea. Can I see her? You'll see her, to identify her. All the indications point to a violent gang rape, with beating, mostly to the face. The fact that she didn't complain makes the investigation very hard, even if we reach the right people, it's doubtful we'll find someone to testify against them. Do you have any idea who could have raped her? Tell me, were you two possibly trying to get pregnant lately? Can you turn that trash down? Who changed the window? It was broken. Who broke it? Hey mom, what's up? Bye, mom. I want you to give this to Eli, when he comes. All right? Can I count on you? Can I count on you? It's important! Talma! Amalia. Amalia? Amalia... Nathan? Hiya. I'm Uri. Uri. Talma's husband. You know, I visited... your grandfather. They're taking very nice care of him. Aren't they torturing him? No. No, no, no... No way. They're putting a bit of pressure on him, but he isn't telling them anything. There's also some globe... isn't there? He asked me to tell you that Talma gave the globe to Amalia, and he asked me to take the globe from Amalia, and give it to you. But... I can't find her. - Amalia went away. Amalia was here? Where did she go? I don't know. Okay. Wait! She told me to give this to Eli. She said it's important. - What's important to give me? Who's that up there? Hi, I'm Uri Bloom. I'm Siton. Bloom... Bloom... Talma Bloom's husband. Oh, Talma's husband... so why didn't you say so? She hasn't been here in a long time. How is she doing? - She's dead. What do you mean "dead"? - She's dead. Someone... a few people... I don't know... raped her, killed her. It's Haim. That motherfucker, Haim. Haim? So you'd stab me? You'd do that? Because I can't do that. Understand? I can't do that. I love you! - Stop! I love you. - They'll come looking for me... I'm not stupid. I told them where I was going. - Who'll come looking for you?!?! Who knows where you are?! Who cares about you?! - Eli does! Eli... I've seen what Eli's made of... I... told her not to go there. She told me she wanted to talk about Amalia. I told her so. That they're crazy. That they're mad... I told her not to go there. - Were you there? - I swear... I didn't see anything. I didn't see anything... Where are they? Tell me where they are... Take me there! - It's... There... Over on the... - Where?! By the... mouth of the river. So why are we running away? We're not running away, my sweet... We're going on our honeymoon... It's about time. My beauty... Stop! What are you doing? Eli? Are you alright? Fuck! Are you alright? What's that? We have to get to a hospital! Go! Go, they're still there. I didn't make it. I didn't find Amalia. Eli. Eli, this is what we're... - Go!! Hold on... - Go. I'll be fine. Go... Go! Wait for me here. Don't move. What's your name? - Yefet. Like girls? You're early. They'll be here later. You like girls, right? No, I'm actually here for the boys. - We have boys too. Do you... receive, or... give? I give... Where's Haim? Went to the Sheraton with some girl. Now buzz off and let me sleep. What's your name? - Yunes. You better not sleep now, Yunes. Know why? Because you don't want to miss this, Yunes. What is this?! - This is your guts. And here, on the side, this is your stomach. And here on the left, you know what this is? This is your heart. It's still working, the piece of shit, so we'd better stop it, because it's a shame to waste it on a pig like you! Did you find her? - No... Haim... took her to the Sheraton. Have you ever been to Hamburg? Nice town... My flight's at ten. Lufthansa. Uri, don't forget to give Nathan the globe. I won't forget, Eli. I promise you. I won't forget. Aufwiedersehen. How many times do I have to call you? Come. Sorry. I didn't hear you. I was in the shower. No, no... Haim, I don't want any. No... I don't do that. Why, you never let me do that! Today, I'm letting you do it. Today, I'm letting you... Tonight's our special night... You're going to be my wife tonight. A woman. You're no girl anymore. Who loves you more than I do... Come. It will be less painful this way. Go get the whiskey... It's on the minibar. What's taking you so long? I don't know... I feel a bit sick... I feel weak suddenly. Look at how my hands are trembling... Here, drink a little. Lie down for a while... Who's this? Uri. Uri. Talma's husband. Who's Talma? If you move, you die. What do you want from me? Who's Talma? Talma, the prettiest girl in class. You know, eighth grade, ninth grade... I didn't have the guts to approach her. Every time she'd turn to me, I'd cast my eyes down. Only in tenth grade did I muster the guts to approach her for the first time. Just kidding... She approached me. In the beginning, people said it would pass by the time we joined the army... Then they said it would pass when we married. Pass? With every passing day, we merged more, and more, and more. And more. Like grapevines. Have you ever felt that, Haim? Shame. According to my calculation, you have about a minute and half to live. In the meantime, if you're looking for your dick, it's in the garbage. And that morning, I got a call at the office where I work as a lawyer... used to work... Nadav was on the line. He said they were experiencing a terrible clash, and he needed me and 2 other soldiers to join him within an hour and that there was a chopper waiting for us at the Tel-Aviv airfield. We left the airfield, and landed 200 meters from the village, just like I agreed with Nadav. Nadav was agitated. Two soldiers killed, three wounded. The whole unit has 10 people, and there had been a lot of shooting there. We entered the village. There was laundry hanging in one of the alleys... shirts, sheets... and all that... So Nadav fired a round at it. - What have you got against laundry? He didn't answer me. We went on. We crossed a little clover field, and an orchard, a fruit orchard... pomegranates. Lemons. We crossed a little ditch, and continued, in the mud. It was muddy. Very muddy. And then Nadav... stopped by a tree. He pointed at the shack... This is the motherfuckers' position. You coming? You two stay here, and shoot anything that moves, got that? And we approached the shack, from the front. From the side that had no windows. It didn't have any windows, not even... the living room window. And she... we reached the door. I counted to six... thr... thr... three or six. And... as the count was up, Nadav kicked him... not him. It. The door. And we stormed in. There were 2 terrorists in there. Who dropped their pants... no... their hands... their firearms, of course. And, as they were holding their hands up, Nadav shot Yefet and crushed his skull, and then shot a round into Yunes. When he was through with them, he changed the clip, and... meant to shoot the one who jumped out of the window. And then... That was when we saw the old man and the kid, and I... jumped on Nadav, and told him not to touch Nathan, because... he had just told the grandfather that they had to find fire for the island, and that was even before Talma had a chance to take him to the... old folks' home. The old folks' home. So... I laid Nadav on the floor, and told him that I would buy the kid the globe. And Nadav asked me... he asked me... if we had gotten everyone, and I laughed. I laughed, because I said we still had Haim. Because Yunes was gone, and Yefet was gone, and Talma was gone, and Eli was gone, and everything was so far gone, that we didn't even have a single shell-shocker left. I invited him to have spaghetti at Amalia's. But he gave me an order to burn the shack, so I took Nadav out, I took Nathan out... Nathan... And I put him on the tree, and they took the grandfather to the old folks' home. And I burned the shack. I burned the shack. And we stood outside, and looked at the flames, and sang... "We'll build our country," a homeland," "Because this land belongs to us, "We'll build our country, a homeland... "As our blood decrees, As the generations decree... "We'll build our country, despite all our destroyers, "We'll build our country, with our willpower. "An end to malignant thralldom, A fire of freedom, burning, "A luminous thread of hope... Shall make our blood boil "Thirsty for freedom, Independence... "We stride with force, to liberate our people!" There's another verse, but we didn't sing it, because I had to go back to Amalia, who put the tomatoes in the pot with the boiling water. Because we made... spaghetti for Talma and for Eli... who didn't come... who didn't come at all. Hi. I brought this for Nathan. This is for you. Wow! - Yes. It's much bigger than I thought. - Yes. Wow, look! This is Hamburg here. - Right... Mom made you some pastries. - Yes. Wow. You've lost so much weight there. I... wrote a poem for you. What? Want to hear? Of course. "Do you see me? "Do I count? "Do you know, in your heavens, "that where I stand, the land you promised me, "is always across the way? "Give me a bit of sky, and clouds to rest my head on. "Let me shut my eyes, and dream of you and me, "for in my place, only dogs run wild..."
