'All incidents and characters in this film are fictitious, bear no resemblance' Greetings...Greetings. Greetings... Greetings to pilgrims of festival! I'll tell you a good story now. First tell us the story, we'll tell if it is good or not. This Taanakaran Temple festival celebrated by villagers of this area there's a long history why this festival is celebrated for generations now. More over this is the story of one family Is it? If a village have to live peacefully, 'Bhagavad Gita' says you can sacrifice a family. If it is necessity to sacrifice a family for peace of a village, what do Gods of Protection do then? Don't talk bad about God, people may protest with hunger strikes Yes...better to keep off the trouble. You carry on with the story. Bhagavad Gita says you can sacrifice, right? Yes Likewise, one member of each family must stand guard, Look at this Police Officer Sakthivel statue majestically standing here His story tells this! What's that Taana? Once upon a time, gangs from North, with a loincloth, Smeared entire body with oil, They attacked in groups in darkness, Without sparing anyone like girls or children, they attacked brutally, They robbed everything, British Govt. which was ruling us then couldn't catch even one of them Then, as one man army, Putting his life at risk, Sakthivel sir, caught the entire gang, he's now our God of Protection. Hanging upside down all the arrested thieves in village, he thrashed them to death to satiate his anger. Looking at his anger, no one dared again to come there with bad intention. Crime rate came down. Village returned to peace. Meanwhile British Govt. under Lord Macaulay created Police Commission, from the year 1861, They started recruiting men for police, Hearing about the brave act of Sakthivel sir, They offered him police job, He's the first police man of this place. He protected the village like God in majestic police uniform Like Gods of Protection Karuppan, Ayyanar, Maada, Sudalai, hence the Police officer protected the place like a God, so, people installed an idol for him, and prayed him as God of Protection. After him, his heirs, keeping his name and fame alive continued offering services for generations honestly, They celebrated festival every year for the God of Protection People too named the family honorably as Police Officer's family. Kumaravelu sir, who is this generation's police officer He's conducting this year's festival. So, his son will become police officer and conduct festival next, right? - Hey, keep quiet, man. - Why? His son didn't become a police officer. Don't know if this festival will happen after his time. Beat the drums! Beat! Bless us to live in peace and celebrate the festival together happily! Father...father... What happened, father? - What happened, father? - What happened, father? What happened, Dad? Is this honour of carrying on for generations going to end with me? My son was born short because I married within my relations. My son couldn't become a police officer. He couldn't conduct festival in your honour. I've become a sinner to break the tradition! Father, don't say like that. I may have failed to become police officer, but I'll surely make my son a police And I'll conduct this festival, father. I'll not let down our family honour, father. I promise it on our God! - Father! - Sir! I'll surely make my son a police, and I'll conduct this festival, father. I promise it on our God! One minute! Height is okay! I have set the alarm exactly at 3:45 a.m. I'll wake you up. - Revathy, Revathy, - Hmm.. "Turn the fortune in your favour and satiate your desire" Mom... My son will come into this world exactly at 12:01 pm! You can enter now! "Standing in queue to get a glance" "Cub came in for this father is cute." Next police officer is born in my family. "Born Police boy." "Cub came in for this father is cute" "Born in Police boy..." Sakthivel! ’Astrology and exorcism done here’ Tell me! "Dad’s gimmicks to make son a cop" "Sing a song praising him" Sir, please forgive me, I'll never steal again! That's the power of Police family! One...two...three... Hey, I got king! Who has got police? Give me. Hey, king is the ultimate power. But for me police is the ultimate power. Then, take it. You're a police officer, right? Find the thief among us. He's the thief! You found the thief again! "Father tries his best..." "..to get the most from his son" I can't do it anymore, father. Son, hang on for some more time. Only then you will become tall. "He stretches his son to make him qualify" - Oh.. - Dip in water Don't want hubby. 14, 15, 16, 17.. - Hey! you come up dear - You keep quiet He's a kid, he may get suffocated. Hey Dip into the water. "Father tries his best to train his son" You first go. "He stretches his son to make him qualify" You have to dip another 10 minutes I'm not in this game, leave me. Where are you running away? Sakthi, I think he's trying to kill in the name of making you a police. Stay away from him.... Don't touch with him Tell me - Mother - Tell me - Mother - Tell me! No...leave me... - Mother? - I'm need to go Mother! If you become afraid of these mere things, How will you become a police officer? I'll prepare you to be not afraid of anything. In all these Kabaddi, sprint, long jump, high jump and swimming competitions which just ended, Sakthivel, Eleventh standard have come first. - Congrats. Keep it up. - Thank you. Why are you walking away silently after winning all these prizes?! Why not say few words? It can inspire other students. Come. dear You'll be a police officer in future, speak bravely. Come, address them. Greetings to all! Why is he talking like a girl? Are you doing mimicry? No madam Suddenly I started speaking in girl's voice. Is he a girl? - What's your name? - Sakthivel. He speaks normally in times like this, doctor. When he's scared, anxious or angry, Even if he's excited with happiness, His voice turns into a girl's voice, doctor. Few minutes later after calming down, he'll speak normally, doctor. - Happy birthday Sakthi! - Thanks, uncle. Hi! Cell phone! Kabaddi Kabaddi Kabaddi Kabaddi... come on Kabaddi lady Kabaddi! Now that he's angry! I'm sure he'll come. Kabaddi... Kabaddi...kabaddi... Look, she's here as I told you! Come...come girl...come on... Generally boys' voice will get broken after 14, to catch complete male voice For some, it remains squeaking voice, It is known as Puber phonia. You would've seen a normal voice getting squeaky on getting angry. Then, they get back to normal voice again. But for your son, his voice changes when he gets emotional. This is new for us too. All his tests and reports are very normal. No problem at all. Just lady's voice. One day, it will get cured by itself. Keep hope. Hey! 'Horoscope is told here Ghost and Black magic can be chased away' You ruined my son's life by trying to make him a police officer. Enough of it, let him remain as my son's till the end. Enough of your black magic and other tests. Throw everything in dust bin. I'll not listen to you anymore. I'll never join police force. Don't say like that, son. I'm in this condition because of you. Everyone is laughing at me. I feel like dying. (Liquor consumption/smoking is injurious to health) (Liquor consumption/smoking is injurious to health) Boss, Rs.5 short, please give me. - Thanks, boss. - Give me a quarter. - Take it. - Credit it, I'll pay tomorrow.

Leaving me as a drunkard, And made me lament like this in the burial ground. Is it justice? I should be living happily, you ruined my life, right? Can I ever get angry in public as a man? Can I be happy seeing a girl? Do you know how torturous it is? I'm unable to tell, it's lousy! Can you feel that pain? That's why I'm here... Use me as you please. But, one condition. How you entered me and changed my voice! Likewise, enter my body again and change my voice. If not I'll not let anyone sleep here peacefully. Hey, get up! Blue whale ! Hey, Pushpa's husband! Hey!

Do you know how the festival was! The crowd and their happiness Great! When relatives meet at one place after splitting up for work, Misers are donating generously, Frowning faces are smiling!

His anger have a valid reason. If a young man's voice changes like that, how painful and torturous it is! Do you know how he's struggling to manage it? I wanted to keep up the promise given to my father. But I failed to give my son the confidence that I'm doing this for his welfare only. What was your mistake anyway? Why are you unnecessarily worrying about it? Today's youth are clear and confident. They know very well what to do and when! Everything will be fine one day! Your promise will come true and prayers will get answered, uncle. - Good morning Sir. - Good morning all, please be seated. Selected a place for research on leather processing?

Not a general temple but a family temple. Temple may belong to one family but Belief on God is common to all. So, take over unoccupied... I mean MLA's land. There are hills around the temple, so no chance of pollution, Sir. But agriculture lands are adjacent to MLA's land. There's a chance of affecting agriculture, sir. No...no...no... Govt. projects must help citizens. It mustn't affect them. No need of any project that affects agriculture. Find another place. Sir, no prayers were offered for 20 years now. No prayers or festivals took place so far. The temple has a ritual, sir. Festival is celebrated only if heir of Taana's family becomes a police man. Last police officer in the family was Kumaravel heirs. His son Palanivel couldn't become a police officer. So, there's no festival for many years now, sir. His son is refusing to join police force. I inquired about him, no chance for him to become police, sir. This place was selected after many enquires Let's allot an alternate place for them, sir. Okay, talk to them smoothly and go ahead.

Ok Brother Then, order two quarter bottles for us. Hey, keep quiet. His looks are not good. - Clear out quickly. - Okay, sir. Order for us without forgetting it, sir. If your grandpa was police in previous generation but commands so much respect. If you become a police officer in this generation. We can collect protection money from market vendors. We can push young bikers. We can kick pregnant women also. We can threaten everyone on the way. We can scare accused saying my punch is 1.5 tons heavy! Shut up! What do you know about police? Come on, tell me. Don't call every police as corrupt by seeing few in the force. Solving public problems is not police job. It's a honour...respect! Majesty! Even if 100 goons create trouble, just one police man can become courage of people. They trust police would protect them. If I stand there and in anger... What are you doing? - Fire! - Don't shoot me, madam. I'll go away, madam. I'll run away, madam. Hey sit down. You saw it, right? I'll be humiliated in public. My father wants to make me police officer to carry on family honour. But entire police force is saved if I don't join the force. I can understand but But your father don't understand this. Shall we catch an auto? - No. - Why? After having drinks every day, I'm leaving my bike in wine shop. - My father is making fun of me. - Is it? I'm going home on my bike. Hey Auto! Come here No Sakthi, please don't do this. You mustn't be doing this. - Enough - I am understand what you wants to say... I am leaving... "Without going out, you've to stay in home to waste time..." Come, buddy. What's this, buddy? You look like a dancer in Telugu films. "My heart is filled with lilting songs of romance..." - What's this? - Yes, buddy. What a torture! Nasty face! - What? - Ignore him. Yes, buddy. My love has worked out well. How? The loan defaulter who used henchmen to hit me, I've made defaulter as my love. What gift should I buy for her? Buy poison! Second round! Nasty face! - Bear toy! - Hey? - Teddy bear, buddy. - That's okay. What should I do after giving gift? Take the poison you bought! Third round! Nasty face! I must break the coconut now. Buddy, wait a second, I'll come back now. - Will you take care of him? - No, entire town will watch. - Why did you bash him up? - He's my paternal uncle. He's torturing me wherever I go! Forget it. I'm going to watch film with my girl, will you do me a favour? - You want two tickets? - She already has bought it. Wait a sec! There's one Anitha. She torturing without paying loan dues. If I ask, she's abusing me wildly. I want to abuse her personally but she's pregnant. It'll ruin my date with off mood. Show your police power to clear the loan. Okay? I'll pick you up today evening. - My girl friend is waiting there. - Party? Ask Venkat Prabhu! Who is it? Hello madam, my name is Sakthi. I'm from DCDC bank. About pending loan. Did you bring settlement letter? Settlement letter... I don't have it with me. Hello! How many of you will come here? How many times I've to tell you? Don't you've any sense? Every time a new person comes without knowing about client's history. Not like that, we got your file just now only. Records show that your pending loan is Rs.16 lakhs. No settlement letter. Don't just repeat your amount only. I've told you many times... According to me, it's Rs.6 lakhs only. I'll pay that only. If that is okay, come with settlement letter. Now you can go. Can you give me a glass of water, madam? Please. This is for you only. Drink. Drink it, sister. Cool now? Pregnant women mustn't talk breathlessly. Elders say it'll affect the child inside. That's why you were coughing. That's why I told you to have water. Thanks for your concern. You can go now. Just a minute, sister. I trust your anger is justified. Because those who don't make mistakes get angry immediately. Your file changed different hands... Sorry, you may not understand it. It has come to my hand after going through many stages. If you don't mind, if you explain me clearly. I believe I can help you or the bank. My husband took the loan. I paid the dues after his death, details are in this file. Now I've to pay Rs.6 lakhs only. But they're asking Rs.16 lakhs after adding some banking terms. For a loan on house, will you charge it so much to buy it yourself? Shouldn't you be responsible? If we take loan, are we slaves of the corporate company? Will you charge high interest? I'll not pay extra! I'll go to court but I'll not pay as you demand. Tell me, Sakthi. I know have one sister her name is Anitha. It's wrong to collect loan after husband's death. But banks or collection agencies don't follow RBI rules. Actually, there's insurance on his loan. But banks don't tell about this to agencies. They try to squeeze money from the customer. Do one thing, send me all the details in WhatsApp. - I'll take care of it. - Okay, Johnny. Thanks. Hereafter you'll not face any problem. Send your details to lawyer. He'll take care of everything. Bye. Sir, one minute. What's this? Fees? Everyone who had come here used to shout on me like a usury. But you heard my case and found a solution for it. After my husband died in a fire accident. I don't have anyone in this world. Your help has given me great strength. All I've with me is my child and my husband's dream. Adopting at least ten children. In this large place, I want to run a small trust. It was his dream. I'm arranging everything towards that aim. It'll happen in near future. As a mother to 10 or 15 children, as their teacher, I'll live with a big family! You'll surely see it. Hello! Stop it, sir! This is our family temple, sir. Who gave you permission to bring it down? Temple may belong to you. But land belongs to govt. No need to get anyone's permission. Temple festival is being celebrated for generations. - How can govt. take over it? - We've done the survey, sir. You would've conducted festivals once upon a time, I don't deny it. No festival has been celebrated for years and not in use now. Anyway there's no chance of festival being conducted here. So we want to use it for public cause. Please go away without creating trouble. Who is creating trouble, man? Govt.'s duty is to protect people and their village. Do you know who he is? When your govt. wasn't there, The man who protected people! He's God in the hearts of people here. After him, he made his family to join police for generations. If anyone steps into village with bad intention, on hearing it is Taana's village they run away in fear. You said about bringing something. Let me see if anything bad is happening here as it happens in other places. You'll know why this temple is here! You've come to raise it down. Let me see how you can get over me! Come. Please listen to me, sir. No use in talking to them, sir. You go, I'll take care of them. All of you see... Look, it's an order from higher authority, allow them to do their duty. If not I've to arrest all of you for stopping govt. staff from doing his duty. Sir, let's see how you can arrest us! Come on, arrest us. Sir, we're asking our rights only. Answer us responsibly, sir. Why are you talking to them? You've force, right? Clear them out! Charge! Look at that! First run over me and then dare touch the statue. I've been tell you... Go backside! I said go back! I'll not let you bring down the statue. Who the hell are you to break it? Festival will surely happen here. He'll surely become a good police officer. He'll definitely come! He'll definitely come as police officer! I'll join police force. Hello! I want to talk to you. "Wake up Police Come up Police" "Within he lit the fire?" Why is he avoiding me? He's not avoiding you. When he gets emotional with fear, sorrow or happiness. He starts to speak in woman' voice in emotion. That's why he's going away from you. He's not avoiding because he dislikes you. Not only that, he doesn't get emotional with other girls. He becomes like on seeing you only.

All the best, let's meet in training. Sure, sir. Thank you Hey! You! Sir! What drugs are you using? Drugs...drugs... Nicotine? Axycotin? Or something different like demoxyin? I didn't use any drugs, sir. Why are you arguing with me? Sorry, sir. didn't use drugs, sir. How dare you break my record with this physique! Do you know who am I? Complete sportsman. Touch my arms. - Come on, touch it. - Sir! Touch it I'm older to you by 25 years. How is it? Don't I know? Who would do what? Sir, you mustn't go there. Normal person can't run like that. Tell me, what drugs did you use? Tell me, what drugs? Sir...sir... Who are you, man? - Are you his drug peddler? - Sir, I'm his father. - Why are you staring at me? - No, son...no... Be calm. Don't talk. Hey... Why are you so silent? You're a drug peddler. You're calming him. Sir, I didn't use drugs. What? Tell it once again! Come on, tell me. Sorry, sir. You should've joined women police force. You're at wrong place. Not only you came here but dared to beat my record in my ground. Get out! Not a police officer, you can't even become a security guard. Get out!!! What are you looking at? You lead a honourable life, created history, and today standing tall here. But I'm unable to do it. Though talented, you know the pain of humiliation in public. It's paining here. They say God up there will take care of us! Are you looking after me? Can you see me? Can you understand my pain? I don't know what my mistake was! That's why I avoided it all these years. You humiliated me in public. I passed in every test but voice? Miserable failure. All are laughing at me! Let them laugh...how can we create history if get everything easily? If there are no problems, what can we do here then? You don't worry, I'm here. I'll take care of everything. I'll come back... I'll come back majestically. Okay, good night. There are no norms in police rules to reject on voice. There are many officers who talk in squeaky voice. Our DSP Daniel, he was recently transferred to Madurai, right? Yes, sir. But they hesitate to speak in public. Because the opponent must fear a police officer. It'll not be good if they talk in female tone. The problem in your case is Thilagan. Your bad time he's DIG now! We send all written and physical tests to ESRB. They select the best candidates. They'll send the training order to this range office. Your son is police officer if he signs the training order. But he has an opportunity to reject for misbehavior. Very cunning person. He got assets illegally wherever he gone. Close to Minister. That's why over bearing attitude. We can also meet the Minister for same post. But we can't meet him with empty hands, right? You know what I mean...I understand it sir. Uncle, please wait. Yes, sir. I'll discuss with them and meet you, sir. - Okay, Varadarajan. - Sir! Generally fathers don't understand what their sons needs are! Some children can directly tell father what they want. But I can understand my son's problem. He's also trying hard to change himself. But still I'm useless as his father. He says no problem in rules, right? I'll take care of it. Tell him not to get anxious, tell him to be free. Okay, you go. Okay...okay... - What happened, Dayalan? - Nothing, sir. - Nothing, I'm okay, sir. - Okay? You go, sir. Sir! Hey, you? I don't know how to address you as man or woman. Sir, I want to talk to you. What? As you think I didn't use any drugs that day, sir. If you want I'll take the tests even now, sir. But my voice changes only when I get emotional, sir. But you abused my father... sorry sir. Don't get emotional, you may start speaking in female voice. The moment you broke my record, your police career is finished. I thought of closing the case for usage of drugs. Then, I heard your voice. I rejected you for misbehavior with senior officer. Get out! Sir...sir... Sir, police is just another job for others, sir. But not for me, sir. - Our family... - No amount of pleas can get you police job. You can't be a police man till I'm in the police department. I don't like you at sight, go away. Why are you requesting him? Do you fear he'll reject you? Do I've any personal problem with him? Nothing like that. If he's my enemy, I can thrash him. Senior officer, after getting posted in Salem, Erode and Theni in last 10 to 12 years. Now he's DIG of Vellore Range. He can't touch my qualifications. It is recorded. Even if he rejects, I can file case with my record details. But if he rejects me for misbehavior using my voice. I can't do anything. That's why I went to meet personally and explain him. But he's refusing to listen to me. You know complete details about him, right? Why did you ask me to collect his database of Twitter and Facebook accounts? Take it. First I requested him. If he still rejects me, I'm prepared to do what I can do! That's why I asked you his database. - Listen to me carefully. - Go ahead. Don't feel bad for losing police job. There's super singer program. If you sing with this voice, you can reach grand finale also. You can go to Singapore and Malaysia also. They'll offer a new house also, try for that, buddy. I'll talk to playback singer Chitra. Hi aunty! Come in...come in... I'm Venkatraj, HM of Salem Govt. High school. She's my wife Anuradha. My daughter Nivedha. After finishing MS in Microbiology, she's a trainee with local Nobel Hospital. I can understand your predicament. Why are we here? I'll come straight to the point. We started searching for bridegrooms for Nivedha. She told us about your son. We inquired about him, we're satisfied with him. Our daughter is very cool and docile. I mustn't tell you that. I know...I've seen it. She's more docile than what you say! I'll talk to my son. Situation is not good now. - But... - I know, Nivedha told about it. They say if a good happens in home, it'll change the situation drastically. What's all this? If you had expressed your love for me, why would I bring my parents to your home? You're trying to avoid me. Look, love will not work out for me. You can't understand even if I explain it. I know everything. Your friend told me. People were surprised to hear about it. But I was very happy on hearing it. Do you know why? The symptom you don't get on seeing or touching any other girl. It comes when I come near you, right? You didn't avoid because you don't like me. You like me and your heart is very happy for it. Your heart is ringing the alarm, that's why you tried to avoid me. Tell me now, don't you love me? Are you going to tell me or not? Tell me. Tell me, right now. Hello! - Sakthi - Tell me, uncle. Come with your physical reports to the place I tell you. - Why? - Come, I'll tell you. Uncle...uncle... Sakthi, come straight. Okay. - What are you doing here, uncle? - My duty is like that. In this thick forest? A dead body near railway track. Body? Why did you ask me my reports? - We went to meet a retired IG earlier, right? - Yes. It seems he's going to Chennai. He asked me your details. Had you told me, I would've given it myself, right? He wants to talk to me, so he has asked me to meet him. Moreover clearance team will take an hour to arrive. - For that? - Till then, keep a watch on body. - How can I? - I can't trust others and leave it here. In fact I mustn't go at all. I'll come back in 30 minutes. Uncle...uncle...listen to me. Don't leave me alone here. Uncle! Abuse me as you like. But be careful with body. Don't let dogs and fox touch it. Hey, how dare you...? I will kill you Hmm...I have closed it. You close and sleep Hey Who is this? Hey, Hey Uncle... Hey! Sorry uncle... You got me caught by the ghost. Will you live fairly? (Phone ringing) How far will you run? - You are...? - Human! - A lady ghost there... - There are no ghosts. Fear is ghost. As far as you fear, so are the ghosts. Come. You? Another man has entered, how am I to scare him, sir? No problem, uncle. We've an idea now, right? At least 2 or 3 deaths happen here every month. We can treat him as and when we get an opportunity.

I told you keep a watch on body, why are you sleeping here? Okay, clearance team is here, you can go now. How did I come here? I don't know what happened to me? Sir! Hmm... - Is it coming in our limits? - Yes, sir. As mother to 15 children. As their teacher. I'll lead my life happily. You'll definitely see it. Any doubt, Varadarajan? Sir, only injury is in his head. May be train hit made the body fly away. That is... Have you inquired about her? No one for her, she was living alone, sir. If it was murder, they would've disfigured the body beyond reorganization. - Isn't it? - Yes. So, it may be suicide. No, this is not suicide, sir. I know her well. Very confident woman. What's this, Varadarajan? Who is he? - Sorry, sir. - Keep quiet, boy. Send the body to post mortem immediately. Okay, sir. If no one comes to claim the body, close the case under section 174. Okay, sir. Don't close her case, sir. She wouldn't have committed suicide. Hey, who the hell are you, man? How dare you argue with me! Get out from here. Are you making fun of me before outsiders, Varadarajan? No sir, he's my sister's son. Then, he must see and go quietly. Mustn't poke his nose in case like a police officer. - Got it? - I know, sir. I've finished selection for SI post and waiting for posting orders. Oh...is it so? Then, investigate the case after joining duty. Now don't take our lives, please leave the place. She committed suicide after getting pregnant without husband. Are you supporting her? Moreover SI selection too! Go out. Don't talk bad about her, sir. Do your duty honestly for the salary...

Come...come with me. - He's poking nose. - I told you to leave, right? She wouldn't have committed suicide with a dream and unborn child. I feel something fishy. If you feel so, find it. As far as I'm concerned, you're a police officer. I'll help you in whichever way possible. Barbie dolls don't spot a dot generally, can it be blood? I think this is blood. Can you get me details of it? To do analysis in any lab, they'll ask minimum 0.5 ml. I think forensic lab can do it. My friend is there, Will try our best. Sakthi, here is the mobile call list of that dead girl. How come she got so many calls from one number only... That too at late night. Hello! - Hello, I'm Anitha here. - Anitha? - That property loan! - Yes, how are you doing, Anitha? I'm fine. - I've a good news. - Tell me. I got NOC letter on my home loan. Oh! - Thank you very much. - No problem. - I got back my documents also. - Super! I don't have any more problems. As I wished, I'll turn this house into a trust. You'll be the chief guest for opening ceremony. She said she got back her house documents. Why did lawyer call her so many times after that? The number you are calling is currently busy Don't worry, sir. I've removed all the evidence from my office. Nobody can find it. I'll go hiding till this problem eases. Okay, sir. Hey! Why are you hitting me? - Why did you kill her? - Who? - The girl I asked you to help, that girl. - Who? That property loan girl? What are you blabbering? Why would I kill her? Look at this! Are you suspecting me for this? Then what? If you try to escape switching off your phone. Won't I suspect you? I'm running away from a proxy problem. It's in no way connected to this case. I did go to file the case, but a document was missing. That's why I called her so many times. Didn't you file the case then? I didn't do it. But she told, she got NOC. Got NOC? How can it come without filing case? May be she repaid the loan. Vada is getting cold, come fast. She said she'll not pay money. The guy who collected from her is coming, right? Why are you getting anxious? Take it. - Hello! - Hello! I've the details of the blood sample you gave me. Okay, tell me. If you here... I'll tell you. You said you got the details, right? If you come here, I'll tell you. I can't come now, please tell me. Then...if you give, I'll tell you. What should I give? What? Hey, what's this without bothering about seriousness? Tell me. That's it, always you want to have your say. Okay, that's human blood! B positive group. Couldn't get much details by forensic lab too. But gave information on HDA1 test and DNA profiling. The blood belongs to a pregnant lady. Blood in home... body is on railway track. How is possible? I'm confused, buddy. Hi Dooma! How long I've to wait for you? - Buddy, he's the guy I told you about. - Did you collect money from her? Yes, bro. I collected money from Anitha. Not a rupee is due, full settlement. This new bike is from the big incentive I got from it. Which number she called you? After getting paid in full, I had drinks and called her to thank her. She abused me wildly. I deleted her number to avoid trouble. Did you go to her home to collect? No, bro. If I knew he would buy so many things, I wouldn't have eaten today morning. Anyway I'll have a go at food. Get me a plate of Aappam. You eat. - Shall we start, buddy? - Okay. I'm asking all of you a question, answer me truthfully. Who took my Iphone kept here? - Tell me the truth. - Accomplices! - What do you say, buddy? - Don't leave them, ask them, buddy. - Hey, Manager, come. - Manager, come here. - Tell me, sir. - Hey! I got it from US. Iphone, it vanished in seconds I went out to wash hands. Nobody would steal here, sir. I came here for the mutton soup here. - I lost my Iphone. - Sir, please... How can you get mutton soup in vegetarian hotel? How dare you accuse me of making fake accusations? - Ask him toughly. - I'll smash your face. Are thieves working here? Who is he? He's Kodandam. - You've a Iphone? - Yes. - Someone stole it? - Yes. - What's your qualification? - Sir, MBA. MBA, my foot. - What's your qualification? - I've written NEET exam now only. Perfect! Send him out. You're trying to cheat them. If I tell them, they say I'm a drunkard. Please go. That's MBA told that He would steal everything - Where's my Iphone? - Sir, no one would steal here. Are you making fun of me by a drunkard? CCTV footage is there we 'll see that - This is correct. - Good. Sir, no phone is there. I kept my phone on that table only. Zoom in closer. I've checked zooming closely. There's no phone on that table as you say, sir. He has masked the phone, he's a cheat to the core. - I call the police. - Sir...sir...wait, I'll call manager. - I'll get all of them arrested. - Get him quickly. Go! Dude, He believes calculator as phone. Okay, you check it. - Which date? - 26th. That's our collection agent. Look, she's coming now. - Is it she? - That's her. Can't see her face in this, Go to other side camera. - Why is it showing error? - Okay, leave it. If she goes in, she must come out, right? We can see her face then, wait. She left without showing her face. What? What are you thinking about? Buddy, she's not that girl, she's another girl. To give documents to Anitha, someone else is paying her loan. Anitha gets the document. She dies immediately after getting it. Anitha didn't commit suicide. The man who paid loan has murdered her. Yes, because of collections agents like you. Like me? Are you playing with me? Who has taken loan of property? Who is struggling to repay it? Banks and collection agencies like you know the details. How can a third person get the details? Data exchange! You're selling customer information for few instant bucks. Because of that data exchange only. In tea shop a man asked for papers to buy few drinks. - Senthil. - No. He asked you but the man who pays for the papers. - Who is that man? - Johnny! He's the third guy who is threatening people with information. Hi Johnny! Whose information do you want? What's this? It has my name. Yes, I want you. Why did you punch me suddenly, bro? Tender nose, it broke. Tell me, shall I make you the owner of Taj Mahal? How about Vellore Fort? Whom did you give property loan information? Only private detective agencies and police, Ask inside information by hacking Twitter and Facebook accounts. But banks and telecom database seekers don't ask names and address. Bro, you know one thing. Details of other people is big business now. Information on property loans are sought by banks, private finance companies, Big real estate agents, builders, land brokers. They seek information as per their requirements. Moreover they don't come directly to seek information. Because data exchange is legal as well as illegal. I'm bothered about money I make, I'll give them complete details. I'm giving you the same list. You find yourself what for they used this information! Excuse me, bro. I know you're seeking this info for a good cause with that punch. A humble request. Don't reveal my name or about your punch to anyone. Please! - Who is it? - His brother. Who are you guys? My house documents. How did you get this? House was under mortgage, right? We repaid the loan. We came to show the document and take it. How did bank give you this document without my signature? I'll file a case on bank. You can file case later, first sign this document. These aged persons tortures not tolerate us, Shit Why a blank document? Do you think we don't have anyone to support us? Get out! - Otherwise I call the police - Hubby! Who are they? Why are you shouting? Hey...what are you doing? Hey...hey... Hey...Don't do... Sign the paper. Sign it! - Hello! - Hello! - Mr.Durai - Yes tell me Calling from DBL bank regarding your property loan. I have repaid the loan and taken the documents. Oh, Ok. Loan has been paid back. He taken the document. So, no problem. So, It' green. - Hello! - Mr.Parthiban? About your loan... Yes I am paid fully and closed it. All procedure finished it off. Oh...okay... Hello! - Mr.Annamalai? - Yes, it's me. About your property loan... I'm paying regularly, sir. Everything is going on fine. Okay...okay... He's paying loan regularly. Documents are in bank. So, in process. Then, it is blue. The number you are calling is not in use Loan is closed. Unable to reach property owner. Then, doubt. Red! Lonely elderly couple Damodaran and Malini living in Arani of Tiruvannamalai district. Since their children living in abroad didn't care about them, They committed suicide in despair. They left money for funeral and a moving letter. Neighbors didn't observe this, their paper delivery boy found them dead. Police got information from him and confiscated the bodies. And sent it for post mortem. Damodaran is dead! Phone is switched off. Red Mark! Anitha is also dead! Phone is switched off. Red mark again! Then, other red marks in the list?! "Yeah!" "Yeah!" "Come on" "It's a green-blue-red game Red colored lines to blame" "Until the mystery is solved Keep the victory lap on hold" "Papers prove with numbers Identifies the partners" "Eyes lose the spark Or the path becomes dark" "Somewhere the truth illuminates It opens the mystery gates" "Smoke explains about fire Sundries hide the treasure" "Remove the tiny obstacle It can lead you to a spectacle" "Legacy is your blood group Truth cannot hide from a cop" "Come to investigate.." - Ravi Mohan owns this building, right? - No, he died in accident. Someone else has bought this property. Crimes will scatter evidences... You can find everything. "A small stone can enter your mouth" "Fire can bend any iron..." "Evidence is scattered everywhere..." "Wild grass and rocks hide treasure..." "Crimes will scatter evidence" "You can find everything right before your eyes..." "Your blood will boil.... Police can find anything..." "Investigate... come...come..." "Mystery...everything is mystery..." "Come bravely...come..." "Investigate... come..." "Investigate...come...come..." "Mystery...everything is mystery..." "Come bravely...come..." He died in an accident. He committed suicide, sir. He's no more. No property is owned by names in the list. Many are dead now. But property is owned by different people under different names. Nothing is getting connected. But something is there. Shall I read.. For the past few years many places have been affected by floods. Cyclone Akash developed on May 12 in 2007. It crossed the shore on May 15th. Cyclone Nisha crossed the shore between India and Srilanka. Varadha cyclone devastated Chennai. That's enough. Aunty went inside, Come let's escape. All bills are in cyclone name... Only one builder should have paid all these bills. Yes, Wind group of Companies have paid all these bills. Then who is the owner? I have seen him somewhere! This pen drive had the all the details about that DIG. Take it. What's the link between MD of this company and DIG Thilagan? Whichever place he was posted, the buildings were built in those places. Yes! Hello! Hello, DIG sir. - Who is this? - It's me, sir. The man who broke your 25 year old record, the drugs man. - Drugs...drugs... - Hey, is it you, dear? You've a long life of 100 year! I was just signing your rejection letter. But you called me meanwhile. Sir...sir...please don't do it, sir. Please sir...please sir... Plead humbly like that. - Sir...sir... - I'll sign it happily. No sir, please don't sign it. Please don't sign it, sir. - Please sir...please listen to me. - I've signed it, man. Till I'm in police dept. you can't become a police You can't even become a security guard. I told you that day itself, right? DIG, sir! I'm telling you now, the day I join police, You won't be in police service. - Hey.... - Wind Group of Companies. - Hey...hey... - Are you shocked, sir? Keep on shouting like that, bye. Thilagan, someone has inquired about all our projects. I've sent you a video, check it. We kill people without any evidence and colour it as suicide or accident. Getting signatures on document is our job. We're just killers. Anitha? No, I'll not sign. Sign! My child, this home, his dream. I'll not sign. Just one signature, you can live with your child. Please leave my child and me! Leave me! (Liquor consumption/smoking is injurious to health) - Tell me. - I got her signature, sir. Well done, my boys. A small mistake, sir. What? Head injury, so we can't hang her. Okay, throw the body near railway track in forest. My range, we'll not face any problem. - I'll take care of post mortem report. - Okay sir With large property, without any near and dear ones, Whatever may happen to such people, nobody is bothered about it, From getting that list and killing them, usurping their property, Through proxy of Wind Group Ravishankar Building flats, malls to make money, DIG Thilagan is behind all these crimes. You were just corrupt earlier, have you become killers now? Such people should be shot dead in street. Till I'm with police dept. forget about becoming police officer, You can't become a security guard also. When I join police, you'll not be in dept. Shocking news that few accidents and suicide cases were real murders. DIG Thilagan is involved in these crimes. Police have arrested Thilagan and people who helped him. Tamil Nadu police will not watch anything affecting the lives of general public. Let anyone commit the crime, let him be in any position of power, even if he's a police officer, They can't escape from law, this govt. has proved it. This case was investigated by a lone man, Sakthivel of Vellimalai, who is joining police force. Tamil Nadu police congratulates him wholeheartedly. This is good for all of us. Thanks all. Excuse me, sir. Yes Can you ask Sakthivel to talk about the case? Oh Yes. Sakthi! You're normal now. You talk to them, son. Greetings to all. You're not a police officer, How did you investigate the crimes of senior officer? When a crime happens, We don't think Police only stop the crime Selfishly don't take just selfie with it, we must do something for it, likewise...Anitha death... For my speculation... Why are you staring me... 3.45 am! Silent! "- Tik-Tok - Ping Pong" "- Tik-tok - Hey Ping pong" "Tink top dear" "My chatting Tom dear" "Keep aside the Snap chat and Voice chat a bit" "By hitting the ping Pong make me a Bounce ball dear" "you are putting the Fruit bomb, by App locking me" "I'm the hit song, you are my Musically.." "Will you join me with love?!"
