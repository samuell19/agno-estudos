["Beatitudes" by The Monks of Weston Priory] [mysterious music] Elle: Hi, it's Elle, leave a message. Officer: Hello, this message is for Eleanor Haynes. This is the Cole Harbour Police Department. I've tried calling several times. There was a boating accident, and a body has been found who we believe to be Thomas Gods. We've been unable to locate any family members, just your number in his wallet. We'd like to ask you to come into the station to identify him and ask you a few questions, and there are a few personal items. I'm sorry to have to tell you this way. The number here is 418-8221, thank you. Asa: I started to think you weren't coming. No, I just thought it'd be nice if we spend some time together. I thought it would be nice if we spend some time ... All right, you're the boss. I'm getting in, okay? You're the boss. You're the boss. You're the boss. [distorted music] Hey, I was starting to think you weren't coming. Elle: You can only stay for a couple of days. Asa: All right, I just want to spend some time together, catch up. Elle: It can't be like last time. I mean it. Asa: You're the boss. I'm getting in. Okay. [twigs snapping] Oh, no. Oh, my salvation. Elle: You're up early. Asa: Hey. Elle: You cooking? Asa: Yeah, I'm making you breakfast. I wanted to surprise you. Over easy, right? Elle: I'm not really hungry. Asa: Well, I made a lot. I can eat twice, it's all right. So, you didn't say too much last night. So, what's new? Elle: Nothing. Asa: Place is looking good. Elle: Thanks. Asa: So really, what's going on? Elle: Not much. Asa: Can you elaborate a little bit? Elle: What do you want to know? Asa: Still playing music? Elle: Yeah. Asa: What about money, are you making any money? Do you have a boyfriend? Elle: Asa, I don't have friends. I mean, what happened to you? You just vanished. You didn't even say goodbye. Asa: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it was confusing. I got mixed up. No, it's more like I got lost. Elle: Lost? Asa: Yeah. Elle: You got lost? It must be nice to be able to pack up and leave whenever you feel like it. I had nothing when you left, absolutely nothing. I had to stay with Damon, that guy's a fucking creep. Asa: I know he is. Look, I was just twisted up in some bad shit. I had to get out of here, you know? I'm sorry, I told you I'm sorry. I mean, what do you want me to say? Elle: You could have said goodbye, at least. Asa: Yeah. Well, I'm here now and I think we should make the most of that. Why don't we do something today. Anything you want to do. [tuba playing] [phone ringing] Elle: Hi, it's Elle, leave a message. Damon: [humming] It's me, I know you're there. Voiceover: Thank you for your call. To erase all messages, press erase again. No message. [ethereal music] Dog: A wander's island with yet another host for the hunger. Again, moving deeper inward where but for these, too far from cautious eyes. Could one more be lost inside the organism? The absolute dead centre of nowhere. [distorted tribal music] Asa: You know what's in there. Elle: I was hoping it wasn't. Asa: You want to give it a whirl, or what? Elle: I don't know, the last time we did this it wasn't good. Asa: Well, you know I'm into it. It's always best with you, though. Elle: Where did it come from? Asa: Just a friend of a friend. [slurping] [sinister music] Dog: Heed me when I speak! This pus and ooze will soon surround you and become an infectious sea to flail against the skin of this parasite. Listen! I have born witness as soul after soul dissolved into murk. From this man, the illusion, cut yourself away. Before my word, your light grows faint. [menacing music] Elle: I'm in a dream and there's a dead fish rotting on a picnic table next to a river. I don't know why I keep having it. Sometimes it's three times a week. Sometimes it's like months. Asa: Amen. Elle: Wake up. Asa: Are we even now? Transient: [LOSER, LOSER] ! Have you seen a dog? [I'm so afraid] [unintelligible]. Asa: No, man. Transient: [Loser]! [slow haunting blues music] Sarah: Hey, Eleanor! Elle: Oh hey, Sarah! What's happening? [distorted tuba music] I really can't stay, I gotta get going. Sarah: We should jam sometime! Elle: Yeah, sure. Asa: You shouldn't smoke so close, you're gonna kill them. Elle: You care about them more than me now? Asa: No, you shouldn't smoke either but you're gonna kill them. Elle: What's this? Asa: It'll make them taste better, just a little bit. That's good. Elle: So, how long you really staying anyway? Asa: Well, how long do you have? You want to kick me out already? Elle: No, it's been nice having you around. It's been kind of quiet around here. Asa: Yeah I know, I missed you too, I did. Elle: Stop it! Asa: Whoa. Sorry. I haven't been on a bed in probably half a year. Elle: Sleeping on the floor again? Asa: No. Elle: So, why don't you tell me you've been this whole time? Asa: Well, this guy I know, Tommy Gods, he got in all kinds of trouble with these clowns in Cheaters Cove. Stole something of theirs that had significant value. Guess he split town when they found him out. Probably made for the hills. Maybe he's dead. In any case, these guys he robbed, they somehow thought I was Tommy or at least they didn't care one way or another. Someone had to pay for it, so ... One night at a bar downtown a couple of goons grabbed me and the next thing I know I'm knee-deep in dead fish, doped out of my tree. They'd taken me to this weird fish farm where I was to work off Tommy's debt harvesting goddamn sea eels. It was just me and this fucking sadistic boss. This gross man. We stayed in this fishing shack day and night. Never left, not even for the washroom. When it would rain this dirt piss and shit floor would turn into this vile of mud and it would just get caked all over him and the rest of the place. It was like that all the time, disgusting. I couldn't be in there. That's why I slept outside. He stayed in that shack all day just barking at me through the door, barking at me to kill more eels, always more eels. I was breaking neck after neck after neck. Then I'd pile them on these rafts just as high as I could throw. It was nonstop. When the tide came in, a couple of old-timers would show up in a motorboat. One of them would go meet with the boss, the other one would hook up the rafts to haul those fucking eel corpses out of there. Overheard one of those guys say they were using them to make expensive soap for rich old bags in Europe, I don't know. They didn't talk to me and I didn't speak. No, I just waited to get out of there. So, the last time those old bastards showed up I stole their boat and I took off. Fuck them! It was almost too easy. I realize that I could have left any time. I mean the boss, he never left the shack. The old guys were weak, probably not armed. I don't know why I waited so long. Maybe I needed to be there. The mudman and me. I sure could have used some of that soap. What are you, sleeping? Elle: Oh, you did, eh? Asa: Yeah I did, hey, give me one of those. [ethereal music] [ominous distorted music] Mudman: Yo, banana boy. God lived as a devil dog. [distorted tuba music] Dog: A disease disguised as love. Wily serpent, veteran of your craft. Yes, but a truly great deceiver. Perhaps a stirring performance for a single cell, the lord of sludge and island muck. But, slimy bastard, remember your goddamn station and end this circle of ruin. Tommy shall be the last, I swear, for I can be wicked, too. Now my bark, but then my bite. [ethereal music] Asa: This is it. This is it, Asa, Asa. ASA! ASA! ASA! ASA! [distorted tuba music] Just a hat. It's just a hat. [laughter] Asa. [foreboding music] GET OUT OF HERE! [dog barks] Get out of here! GET OUT OF HERE! Dog: Withdraw from him. Let the tide of [Homer] come until it goes. Reveal for yourself the dying monster hidden under this mask of a man. ["Song of Hope" by The Monks of Weston Priory] [church bell ringing] Elle: Oh? Asa? Asa: Elle? Elle: Yeah? Asa: Where were you? Elle: I went to get some food. What the hell happened here? Asa: You tell me what happened. Elle: I don't know, what about it? Asa: The cooler's been open all night. Everything's dead! Elle: We must've forgot. Asa: We? You did this, why? Elle: I didn't. Asa: I would never leave my cooler like this! Elle: I didn't leave it open! You were the last one that was in it. It could have been either one of us. Asa: What are we gonna do now? Do you know how important this is? Elle: I don't know- Asa: I need to know why you did this! Elle: I didn't do it. We'll figure it out, don't worry about it. Asa: WORRY ABOUT IT! WORRY ABOUT IT! ADMIT IT! [slap] That's all I have, Elle. They could have lasted us years. Elle: [sobbing] I didn't want to do it for that long. Asa: You did this! Elle: I just didn't want it to get like last time. Asa: We can work it out, we can work it out. It's okay, it's okay. Let's move on. We can fix it. You just have to call that guy you know. Elle: No. Asa: Yes, call him. Elle: No, you said I wouldn't have to. Asa: I wish we didn't have to, I really do. Let's do it. Elle: It's just ringing, he's not picking up. Asa: Call him again, this time dial the right number. Elle: He's not answering. Asa: Give me that, give me that. We're just gonna have to drive over there. If he's not home, we'll break in. Elle: No. Asa: Hey, I know you still have his key. What are you doing with that? You know, he's so doped up that he won't even notice. Elle: I don't want to. Asa: Hey, it's all right, all right. [distorted tuba music] I told you he wasn't home. I can't see a fucking [unintelligible] a light. Thanks. Open those drawers. Damon: Thanks for stopping by. Asa: Hey, Damon. Damon: Hello. Elle: Tried calling first but there was no answer. We just need to get a couple slugs. Damon: And we were just gonna make ourselves at home and borrow some? That's, whatever. Why don't you just make yourself at home? Have a seat, let's see what happens. Do you want a soda? Elle: No, thanks. Asa ... Asa: Just wait. We can't stay too long. How about something for the road? [ethereal music] Elle: We can't stay too long. How about something for the road? Damon: What, do you think this is a drive thru? Fast food? They're my pets, you know. Had these slime balls for over 10 years now. Got to show them respect. You treat them well, they treat you well. They get much stronger with age. I don't understand how you do-druggers walk around with them in your little lunchboxes wrapped up like a sandwich. It's no wonder they don't poison you! I'll be right back. Asa: Don't worry about it. Damon: Here we go, my little lovers. These aren't like the mutilated regenerates you're probably used to. No, these come from the islands of Cheaters Cove. Naturally, they're permitted to grow and reach full maturity. I hear the islands are crawling with them. I'm thinking maybe dropping it all, living like a hermit, live the infinite trip. Maybe I'll be a slug. Elle: Okay well, I'm just gonna take these Damon: You relax it, lady! Damon: One thing at a time. This isn't a quick fix. Slow like a snail. Elle: That's my jacket. Damon: Was your jacket. It's kind of grown on me. Maybe we could make a trade or something. No, no no no, silly girl! You trying to kill it? Elle: No. Damon: You hardly have to spook it at all. It's a defense mechanism. Love it, you'll get it better days. It's like a cow standing in line factory waiting to be slaughtered. He's watching his kinfolk in front of him about to be killed knowing the same thing will happen to him. Fear is manifesting. His body releases all sorts of chemicals. Fear is a poison. When you eat them as a burger, that poison's still in there. Why do you think this fucked up world so run on fear? Fast food, they're feeding it to you. Doesn't have to be that way. Can be much more pleasant. [distorted rhythmic tuba music] [mystical music] [distorted music] [church bell ringing] Dog: Shed this dying flesh, and return to your body before the earth compacts and the organisms of this electric soil call you home. For now it's just the one, Asa, the shadow who has already taken so many. All his charms, an illusion. All that exists, hunger. I pray that you hunt this man from within yourself and journey the island back to your grave. Trust me, my love, it's time to come home. [distorted psychedelic music] Asa: Asa! [We all know him]. [We all know him]. That's nice. Where are you? Where are you? There you are. You're nowhere. [dog barks] OW! Oh! [I don't know you]. [Don't even know you]. Look [unintelligible] just weren't there. Never found you. Transient: [Loser]! Asa: Never found you. [wind howling] Asa: Elle, wake up, wake up. Wake up. [tapping rhythm] Damon: Couldn't see that coming. [droning music] Damon: Yeah, these ones come from the islands of Cheaters Cove. Live like a hermit, live the infinite trip. [tuba and trumpet music] [foreboding music] [mystical music] [sinister music] Asa: COME ON, FUCK! [distorted tuba music] Dog: My child! You have given yourself to this slug, handed over your soul to a ghost not really here. And now you too have become invisible, bound for only one more chance at redemption. But look for me by your side. For the hollowing children of the island all bear my watchful eye and heavy heart. Even Tommy, selfish poacher, bent on fleecing my sanctuary, raping every square inch to extinguish his desire, bore no responsibility. His body, merely the host. So yes, for even Tommy I wept countless tears. Do not cause me to yet again carry such sorrow. Elle: Hi, it's Elle, leave a message. Damon: Hey, it's me. I know the other night got a little bit weird but I had a fun time, you know. Oh yeah, I wanted to say I was looking through a pile of things here and I think I found some of your sheet music. Just give me a call when you feel like it. [dog barking] [grunting] Asa: Oh, fuck! [mysterious music] Elle: [crying] I don't want any more! I don't want any more! [unintelligible] threw away. [fretful music] No! Asa: I was beginning to think you weren't coming. Elle: Asa? What is this? What are you? Asa: How many times have we done this, Eleanor? Alone, empty, here you are again. Returning to us. To your purpose. Elle: Is this real? Asa: You're a dried up fish. Suffocating without water. Only beneath the air will you truly be safe from God! Elle: No! Asa: Descend with us! Leave your dying life. [menacing music] Shopkeeper: Hey Tommy, how's it going? Tommy: All right. Shopkeeper: A little early for fishing, ain't it? Tommy: Yeah, I guess so. Shopkeeper: Didn't see you at church the other day. Tommy: Yeah, I moved away. I go to a different church now. Shopkeeper: That will be $9.29, please. Thank you! Oh, don't be a stranger! Asa: Ready? Tommy: Yep. Asa: Little bit small, isn't it? Tommy: It's all they had. Asa: Come on, let's go. ["Song of Hope" by The Monks of Weston Priory] [mystical music]
