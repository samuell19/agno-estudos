I applied for hostel and you allotted me a room. As a warden. As a warden? - Yes sir. Well you have just stepped into your first year. And you are already a warden? Well why are you taking it seriously? It's the first year. We ought to crack a few jokes. According to me laughter is.. Fear, terror, tyranny.. Since ages these are being used to rule over masses. Fear is the weapon which helps constrict people to the law. I have heard that the closed room is haunted. All this is just a rumour. Nothing more. What are you saying? There are ghosts for sure. Seniors-Why are you so scared? It happens in every college. Walk straight. Doctors? Big boss wants to harass the seniors. Actually sir my mother is from Calcutta. - Really? And she is into classical singing. - Leave us. No, no. Sir, please leave them. And you? Sir, I mean let us all go. You are very concerned about them?

Change it. Is everything all right? - Yes sir. Sir if you wanted to .. Pandit you either cough or speak. - Yes sir. And listen for the cough take.100 grams munakka, ..100 grams matti, 100 grams ginger.. ..and grind it with amla and have it thrice daily. Sorry sir. Sorry. What are you both doing there? Sir we came here walking together. Sir they are playing a game. Walking together. Who did this? Sir actually.. ..we were feeling hot so we.. Their names? Come. Both of you change your clothes and come to eat. Sir we are fine. - Who is requesting you to come? Have you come to my wedding? Abhi? - yes sir? Who were the seniors. No sir. All good. I understand everything. I know everything. I won't tolerate this. Understand? Pandit? ..good you kept your miuth shut or else.. If they watch news their thoughts shall be pure. Stay in your limits. Put a parental lock on other channels. - Yes sir. The boy is wise. - Yes we will do it tomorrow. - Excuse me sir. That jerk made a very big mistake. Now what do we do? What was the need for him to complain? Seniors won't leave him. What can we do? Ragging takes place everywhere. That is true. - That is.. Hey J.K? Say. - Did you see? The chicks passed from here. Where? - To anatomy class. They will be scared. First of all I would like to congratulate you.. ..for choosing such a noble profession. Congratulations. Thank you sir. Doctor? You come as well. Come. First year? - Failure. - You all would like to become doctors. But let me see who amongst you has it in him to become one. Hands down. Get used to the smell. - Yes. So. Welcome to a new life. Pleasure meeting you sir. - See you. - Same here. Abhimanyu?- yes? Elena is here. From Spain. To take professor Anirudh's interview. Amazing. - How cool! - Oh? How do you know him?- Who doesn't know him? He is the college's USP. That's nice. - I tried reading his book once. Very nice. - Naturally. He is a very big scholar. Seriously guys. He gives open lectures. We should all go. - Definitely I don't know about anyone else. But I m going for sure. Abhi will go. To Elena's class. - Paritosh? Sorry guys. No hard feelings. - It's okay sir. Take it easy. - Abhi? Sorry friend. - It's okay sir. Thank you. - Thank you sir. Thank God it's over Abhimanyu. It's so funny. One room is locked. And one room has four inhabitants. It's management's decision. But why keep this room locked? It is said that some ghost lives there. Nobody stays there. It is said that the ghost still wanders. Everyone says so. He still wanders.. Let us shift him to 404.- He won't survive. You think you can live? What say? All this has been done by seniors. See what happens when you cross them? And all this because of you. That's enough. I am leaving this hostel. Why? - I don't want to stay in this hostel. I will take paying guest accommodation outside. Should we speak to the warden?- Warden? What's the use? How can the warden help us? - No one will go anywhere. I am leaving this room. This is impossible- but sir. Doctor Vaidya is right. It's not possible. Heard it? Now come. Give me a minute. Sir four of us are staying in one room. Do you realise that a fellow student has committed suicide there? Too many rooms.- And that room stays locked. But sir I don't believe in such things. But we do. And we don't want more rumours to spread. Absolutely.- Sir in fact if you keep the rooms closed.. ..more rumours will spread. It's all in the mind sir. Sir a modern institution like this. How can you believe in such things? Are we clear? - Yes but.. Are we clear? - yes sir. Good. Now go. I told you he won't agree. Laurence I think you should allot him the room. Charles please.- No the kid is right. If we allot him the room rumours will come to an end. Charles do we need another enquiry? Laurence.. - Trust me. This room was closed since three years. You have opened it. Come in. We all have our opinions. Pandit get this room cleaned. - yes. Mind is very interesting. Talking about the master secret of all ages.. .. the biggest secret of them all is the power of your.. ..own sub conscious mind. Very few people know about this power because.. ..very few people actually roam in their subconscious. The brain which studies rocket science.. ..the same brain can be victim to bipolar. Coming to the point.. Let me explain you what exactly is this disease. The definitions for bipolar disorder may vary. But basically.. Basically it is a psychiatric disorder. Characterised by one or more episodes of elevated mania.. ..at one end and the episodes of depression at the other. Excuse me sir. - Yes? Sir can dysfunctional mitochondria be a cause? Good question. Actually.. ..a research team in Japan has claimed that.. And the award goes to professor Anirudh Kosher. - Thank you. I would now like to invite Doctor Ericson come on stage.. .. and honour Doctor Anirudh Kosher. Modern science founadation awards the PNT .. ..to professor Anirudh Kosher. Department of sciences.. ..of university honours Doctor Anirudh Kosher. Professor Anirudh Kosher. Bye. Have a nice day. Meet me in canteen. - Okay see you. Come. - Coming? Yes. - Call Sheryl.

A few minutes back you were with the dean asking for a room. I was present there. I am sorry. I didn't notice you. In fact.. In fact I have read all your books. Okay. Actually the room which you have taken was closed for.. ..the past three years. Just because of fear. And you have proven them wrong. - Thank you sir. Yes but.. - And I am really glad sir. Hello. - Oh hi. Why don't you join me for dinner tonight? Oh that will be great.- Okay I just live behind the hotel at gate no. 7. Why don't you come by 8'0'clock we can do the interview then. Okay. - Thank you so much. Thank you. - Thank you. Come. I really like your question about dysfunctional mitochondria. Thank you sir. - And if you need any papers.. ..any research material on that. Do come to my house and take it. - Thank you. - Okay? Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. Hi sir. - Hello sir. Have you met? Let me introduce you. Come. Watch out. There are stones. "the caged bird.." So you were sleepy? "the bird flies" "the caged bird.." "the caged bird.." Yes do come. Good evening sir. - Good evening sir. Good evening. Good evening. You are looking lovely. Fresh meat. You think it's funny? I am going to make you dance the entire night. So how is the hostel? Good sir. Very good sir. It's nice. - No problems? No sir. - No. If you have any problems then.. - Sure sir. Okay sir. From where do you come? - Sir from Delhi. So you are from Delhi? - Yes sir. Where do you live in Delhi? G.K 2.- Even I live in G.K 2. Have you had dinner at Khan Chacha's? - I have sir.

No sir. - Thank you sir. Okay. Carry on then. Introductions done. - Okay sir. Thank you sir. Good night sir. Don't let them go so easily. Just give me a second. Come back. Now I remember why I called them. Brother chicken. - What is your name? Abhimanyu sir. Mitochondria? Pandit the salt is less. Salt is less. In order to impress the professor? He fails everyone. You can join him. Maybe you will find the madam there. - Yes. She is waiting for me. You speak anything. Have one drink. No sir. Thank you. Then you have it. - No sir. I am a teetotaller. Teetotaller? Why? Sir because the liver get's damaged. Then what are you studying medicine for? If it gets damaged we will repair it. Now take it. - Take it. No sir I don't drink intoxicants. If alcohol was an intoxicant then the bottle would have danced. That's a nice line pandit.- Now tell me it's meaning. It means the bottle would have danced. Which dance? Disco? Bollywood? Kathak? Which one? Sir actually my father is from Uttaranchal. - Did I ask you? Did I ask? Sorry sir. Now say. Sir actually my father is from Uttaranchal. There they have a beedu pappu dance. In that they drink and dance..- Did we ask? Now you say. Sir I think that man drinks alcohol. And he himself dances. But he feels as if the bottle is dancing. Correct answer. He is the winner of today's game. Come child come to the market.- Sir Sir even I was saying the same thing. You are crossing your limits. Do you know what happened in that room? Sir someone committed suicide. Suicide? Someone? He was you senior. What was his name? Sir I don't know his name.- What You don't know your room mates name? By tomorrow you should know everything about him. I can ask anything. Even the colour of his underwear. Sir ..and what task do you have for us. Which of you stood up against the seniors that day in mess? Sir. No one sir. - No one. What no one? Who was it? Abhi. Abhimanyu. That day he was acting smart in front of Vaidya. He stood up for you? That's why today you shall sit for him. Okay sir. Get up.- Up. I won't sit like this. Go. Here is the bottle. Dancing bottle. - Dancing. The dancing bottles are behind you. Start. - okay. I can ask you anything about him. Please sir. Good pants. Please sir. Sir. Sir. Who will carry the baggage? First get out the baggage. I am not taking out the baggage. Reddy? Gaurav you take the baggage. Hey dude pick up the baggage. Stop shooting. First get out the baggage. Hi. - Catch him Help. How is the sleep pattern? Why do you want to hurt yourself? Why are you angry? Oaky we shall meet when you wish to talk. What do you want to know? What do you want to know? - Sabah?- Take her way. Take her way.- Mustafa. Take her to G-ward. Take her to G-ward. Well a second manic episode in 6 weeks. And a continuous depressive phase for two weeks. What do you think? She has been stable for the past year. All of it started recently. Looking at the mixed episodes and rapid cycling.. ..I think we should change her medication. She needs time. I don't think we can help her much. She needs to understand that she has to help her own self. Maybe you can guide her. Do one thing. Stop her anti depressors. Give her mood stabilizers 500mg twice a day. And the phenalphin now. Okay? - Right. Thanks. Hi. Where were you today? Had some work. More important than your studies? More important than you as well. You are hopeless. Tell me the truth. Truth is hopeless. But it still exists. What exists? Ragging. Ragging is a rather old and disturbing tradition. A way to make a man out of someone. According to me those who do ragging need a mental check up. Some people take it. But others break down completely. Like this boy. He committed suicide some years back. Who is he? - Gaurav. I stay in his room. In fact newspapers say because of depression .. ..he couldn't study and failed in the exam. And killed himself. Obviously the matter was something else altogether. But the facts were killed? You mean because of the ragging? Poor guy. What poor guy? He couldn't study and he failed. And then took his life. What did he wish to prove? Abhimanyu even you are stubborn. Even though people advised you against it, you took the room. What are you trying to prove? That there are no such things as ghosts. Meera? There is a boy in college. Abhimanyu. Very brave boy. Very brave. Hey! Father. I want to go to bathroom. I am very scared. One minute. I will see. I will see. Come. Come. Come daughter. Let's go. Let's go. Come. Come. Come. What is there to be scared? No. Please father. Look there is the bathroom. You go in there. I am standing here. Nothing will happen. Please father. I am very scared. There is nothing to be scared off. I said I am standing here. And talking to you. You go in. And come out fast. No father. - go. I am very scared. No problem daughter. I am here.- Please. Go. - Okay. I am here. I am here. Go. I will tell you a story.- Listen. I met micky mouse yesterday. I said I am here for you, didn't I? And I am there for both of you. Here is mom. - Go to her. Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am?- One second Ma'am. Yes Chris? - I had some work.- Say. Actually I needed to consult you about something.- Say. Ma'am I am depressed. You don't look depressed from any angled. No Ma'am. This is just the problem. I don't look it. But I feel so from all angles.- Really? How come? All professors say that I have potential. But I can't concentrate on studies. I am very depressed Ma'am. What is your problem? Mischief all the time. All time? Actually Ma'am I want to be famous. I want that people should know me. They will. They will. And you? I know you. Well actually that was a conference at kopaine. Regarding this institute yes, I am more of a visiting faculty. And my wife teaches here. Okay. That's amazing. If I may ask you doctor.. How does it feel being you? That's a good one. As a matter of fact I am just another common man. With some uncommon aspirations if you might say so. And the biggest source of inspiration in my life have.. .. been some uncommon individuals. Who have had immense influence on my life and.. ..definitely my works. And I must add. The three most important women in my life have been.. ..my wife, my daughter and my mother. My mother is no more. But she continues to be my inspiration. And I know. She will always be there for me. It seems you are very close to your mother. Actually I have decided to dedicate the next thesis.. ..also to my mother. That's great. It was such a pleasure. Thank you so much for your time. - Thank you so much. It was such pleasure.- Absolutely. - Take are. Thank you. Chris? What is going on? Sir actually mind over matter. I am reading your papers. That's nothing sir.. I was just wondering about my name in place of yours.. You have to work hard for it. I am working hard. Sir you?- Doctor you slept so early? Don't you want to study? I have a book for you.- Sent by Chris. True stories of ghosts. Come out. Come. Okay tell me one thing. If medicine was in fact science.. ..then why do people die? Ever heard about vibrations and residual energy? Souls are energies. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed. Why don't you accept it? Gaurav's soul is still here. That room is not yours. It's Gaurav's. Gaurav' soul is trapped here. He is there. Abhimanyu? Since when has all this been going on? Sir from few days. Why didn't you tell me? Sir I didn't deem it right to complain over and over again. Look raising your voice against a wrong act is not.. ..called complaining. Sir but in college it's almost a tradition now.- Tradition? Sometimes it is necessary to change traditions. Please understand. - Hi. What's up? Oh hi.- Hi. This is Meera my wife. Hello Ma'am. And this is Abhimanyu. Oh hi! Okay. So are you free right now? Coffee. Maybe? No I didn't sleep last night sir. He has been ragged. So maybe he can join us for dinner tonight? Yeah. Sure. It's a good idea. 8-8 30? - Yeah perfect ma'am.

It's damaged. we have to change wiring. Why do we have to change it? Sir what's my fault? You have power cuts in day and voltage fluctuations at night. Pandit if we keep replacing things the budget of my.. .. hostel shoots up as well. Sir shall I do it or leave it? I have only one answer to your question. If you do it then you shall keep your job in college.. ..and if you don't you shall leave your job. In that case I shall do it. Yes it's better to have a job then leave it. Good evening sir. Good evening. Good evening. Where are you going dressed like this Abhi? To some wedding? - No for a dinner. For dinner? Where? Sir professor Anirudh has invited me personally. Okay. So as you have remembered your dinner you should also.. ..remember to turn off the lights in your room. I had turned off the lights. Turned them off? Then how are they on? Sir? Give. Partu have the goods come. See. Wonderful. We gave extra money to the pandit for it. Then we got them It's a good hide out friends. - Seniors won't be able to find us. You drink beer. Beer. Bird?- No birds. Hi sir. "one bird" "birds" "they come to pick up grains birds" Sir actually we.. We were not drinking sir. Really? Look children when I was small I made a lot of mischief. But I never got caught like you. Sir we were just.. - Shut up. Let's discuss in the den. Even we have beer. Come we will feed the birds beer. - Come. Please. - Come. Come. Birds in a flock.. What's the need to expose your life's secrets to all.. ..what I had, when I slept.. But ma'am was telling.. You don't know her. Is in contact with each of her students on facebook. Really? - But I hate that concept. If you can get him to join facebook I shall give you .. ..whatever you ask for. He is very out of date. Facebook is stupidity. Seriously. Trust me. Stop it. Stop it. Now you have started eating here. Oh I am trying to help you. - Come. "4 poles gave rise to a weirdstory. - What do you mean sir?" "Romeo was Juliet's love. A story." "You might be the king in your territory." "But when you come here." "You might be the lion in your territory." "But here you are a mouse." "What are you staring at?" "What are you staring at?" Facebook? A perfect example of global marketing. In fact marketing and ruling agencies know very well.. ..how to control our minds. Our likes, our dislikes, needs and also our minds.. .. are controlled by them. We are under surveillance 24 hours. We are under surveillance 24 hours. Shia Guara. The man who gave Cuba its independence. Sir in fact some days back I saw a sketch of Shia on.. ..a man's t-shirt. On asking he said that he is the lead guitarist of some band. Exactly my point. It's really sad. A rebel a freedom fighter, is portrayed as anti-establishment.. .. and cool and sold to your generation as merchandise. When will people understand? We do not have the strength left to think and understand. We are just puppets. Sir? This is for you. Chris?- My throat is parched. Drink. Take a puff. Thanks bro. Here he is. Come here. - Hello sir. From where are you coming? - Sir from Anirudh sir's house. There was a party there? Yes sir. Just like that Party boy. You had drinks? No sir. - No drinks? Come we will give you drinks. No sir.

Say. - Sir jeans and sweater. Jeans and sweater? Were your eyes lowered in the same fashion in front of madam? Okay tell me what do you like. Chris sir? You stay alone in this room? Hitler or butler? What do you mean? Hitler or butler? It's very clear. When you are not hungry then Hitler. And when you are hungry butler. Chris? What happened? What happened?- Sit down. You sat on Chris sir's chair? I will break your bones. Shut up. Shut up. Chris sir. Come. Sit. Sit. What do we have in menu for guest of honour? "b" "a" "g" bag treatment. Bag treatment. Yes. Bag treatment. Pandit are you getting the bag? It must be here. Stand up. Come stand up. Come.- Go. Go. Come. I am Gaurav. I am Gaurav. I am Gaurav. I was born in Nasik. I like Pamela. Very sexy. Leave my room. I only study at night. My room number is 404. You live in my room. That room is not yours.- It's mine. It's mine. I only study at night. I read news. I have committed suicide. I still live in that room. Leave my room. Let me live alone. I am not dead. This is my room. Still there. I am not dead. That room is mine. I am Gaurav. Abhi? I left my book in your room. Thanks. Had too much to drink. Had too much to drink. The seniors harassed a lot today. Don't say. Don't say. 13-14 drinks. You guys drank a lot, didn't you? Who does like that? Did you get your book? Tell me. This is my room. Abhi? What happened? Abhi? Abhi? Nothing. Resuming my last lecture. I would like to share the case of a girl. Name Meenaksi. Age 27 years. Intelligent. Beautiful. She was a very bright student in school. Then after that.. - I think it is nothing.. ..but your imagination. - ..lack of focus. But.. - Substance abuse. But what? Blasphemy. Distractions. At least tell professor Anirudh about Chris and their ragging. And her condition started deteriorating. She started drugs at a young age. She was so called wild, cool. - I can handle it. Experimental. 24 hours.. - Gradually.. Thinking about Gaurav. She became a self proclaimed recluse. Abhi.. Leave that room. This is very common for today's youngsters. Its really not worth it. From the time you have shifted to that room.. ..see how the problems have magnified. Even the seniors are against you. One thing leading to the other. She left the college. - For how long will this continue? At least write a letter to the dean.. Anonymous. This is surely a case of manic depression. About this ragging. This has to stop.- Can't continue. In a closed room. Yes Abhimanyu? Yes sir? Any questions? No sir. Sit down. I think she was a brilliant poet. She wrote nice poems. But one day even that stopped. Leaving things mid way like this.. ..leaving bad things behind became a pattern. And then she started living in that pattern. What followed was a series of relationships that went wrong. And then series of professions that went wrong as well. In advanced stages she started claiming that.. .. she spoke to Aliens. She was hallucinating. It is an interesting case study. Where hallucination takes over. Robertson David said that the eyes only see what mind.. ..is prepared to comprehend. Eyes see that which mind wills to show. That's all for the day. Disgusting. Sir but I don't drink. Who else drinks with you? Sir Chris made me drink forcefully. I am a teetotaller. You were a teetotaller. You stink till the end of corridor. Sir seniors made me drink. Every drunkard says that.. ..someone else made him drink. Drunkard? Me? Sir he is not a drunkard.- He faints in two sips. Sir they give money to pandit and tell him to bring beer. Pandit? Pandit? Pandit? - Yes sir. Coming. - Pandit? Did he order beers? - No sir. - Yes he did. Yes he did. - He did? - No he didn't. He didn't Pandit? - He did. It means you supply beer in the hostel? Supply? No sir. I only bring it when they ask for it. It means the same thing. - Excuse me for a second. Supply or.. - Seniors and juniors. Just listen to me. I will not tolerate this. That you destroy the discipline in my college. Sadda? - Yes sir? - Come to my office. Abhimanyu where did you keep my book? What happened? What happened? Here push it. Look it's not good to drink beer. You are correct Pandit. But not having it is worse. Leave me. - Oh give me. Yeah come. - Yes. Hey give that.. - Sure. Chris what's you problem? Who do you think you are? Call him. - Hey! - Aren't you ashamed of ragging first year students? Sir has called you. - Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Yes sir? - What will you have? Coffee. - Chris. I am talking to you. Sir you gave me yesterday. - Chris? Are you doing me a favour? - I am talking to you. If you harass my friends again I will have to go to the management. I am warning you. Stay out of it. I am warning you. - Go now. She scolded you. Why was she so upset? But she was lovely. You.. Sir I didn't want to complain. But.. Chris and the other seniors. But only you can help me. I am really sorry sir. Don't worry. It's my responsibility. Sir? What happened?- Sir Gaurav. There. There.- Who? Sir please come with me. Sir there sir. There. Sir there he is. Sir? Sir?- Abhimanyu. There is no one there. - Gaurav. Abhimanyu..There is no one there. No one. Calm down. Sir he.. Sit down. Gaurav. - Sit down. No one. No one is there. Look at me. Calm down. Calm down. There is a limit to everything. In the past three years none of you had the guts.. ..to stay in that room. And now Abhimanyu lives there so you have a problem? Why? Because it hurts your ego? I warned them before as well. Ragging should be healthy. Joke and laughter to get familiar with your peers. Not for taking out your frustration the weak ones. No one is weak here. Abhimanyu is strong. If anyone tries to harass Abhimanyu.. ..I shall throw you out of the hostel. Understand? Vaidya? This is a serious matter. Abhimanyu is a rational boy. He himself accepts that the Hallucinations are a result.. ..of thinking about Gaurav all the time. And I am sure. Once the ragging stops he will stop having these hallucinations. Stop ragging. Stop ragging. Stop ragging. - Calm down. Calm down. We won't. We won't. - We won't. We won't put up with ragging any more. We won't put up with ragging any more. No ragging. Stop ragging. I told you sir about Chris before. All this is his mischief. What is the point in meeting me? What shall we play? No a warning is not enough. - This.. Look I have told you that remove him from the hostel. There it is. - He will take up PG somewhere. I don't care. Father. Father the game is not over. What happened? That which I feared. I do not wish to see one more student become a victim of ragging. Father? Okay you don't stress yourself too much. Sir Chris is here. Tell him to wait outside. Listen. It's his final year. Speak to him politely. Give everything here. - Placards also. Anurag keep all this in your rooms. And this.. - Keep it carefully. Good one soldiers. - Good one. Burn it. - Destroy it. What is it? Show me. Ragging must die. - Sir? What am I hearing? That you are scared? Now whom will you complain to? You had so much arrogance. - Sir I am requesting you.. Why are you acting smart? I am not acting smart. - Shut up. So? You were going to drive away our fear. Now you see.. - Sadda? Forget it. Let's have tea. Mustafa? Come. - Pandit one minute. Stop. Stop. Stop. Look brothers no ragging from today. Ragging is for college guys. Not school students. You are right.- Children. How sweet! You guys have touched my heart. Thank you very much. Jerks. - All of them are drama queens. Let's make them do a drama. What say? - Anirudh uncle will also be happy. They will give chocolates to kids. Start the preparations. - Pandit.. ..please post a few posters of children. Okay I will. Hey Chris what is this? 750 rupees? - Come Pandit we will give you the bill. - It's less. And what about the beer worth 17,000? That's wonderful Vaidya. You have taken a pretty strict ruling for the ragging. But these seniors are incorrigible. They say that keep a dog's tail in pipe for 100 years. But it shall still be twisted. Now they are making juniors do a drama. As if there is a scarcity of drama in college. I can see. But the seniors are also happy. I have told you before as well. All this is Chris's mischief. Now tell me what to do about Abhimanyu? He is still insisting on staying there. I believe that we shouldn't play with ghosts. No one has seen God either. But they are there. Great saints have seen so. Weakness of mankind doctor. Even God has instilled fear in their hearts. It's just insecurity on man's part. You must be joking. What to do about Abhimanyu? Look. I still suggest that.. Sir I am really embarrassed about yesterday. Don't be silly. What is there to be embarrassed? Can I use your laptop? Of course. All yours. See I will show you one experiment. This is an experiment on an athlete. He is being hypnotised in a lab. And in hypnosis he is being told that he is participating in a race. After hypnosis his muscles responded in the same way .. .. as if he is in an actual race. His brain couldn't differentiate whether the race is for real.. ..or just an imagination. The same thing occurred with you. When the mind is under pressure it exaggerates everything. You can't differentiate between reality and imagination. The critical mind is locked off. Do you know an interesting fact about the human brain? It cannot absorb more than 400-600 message units at a time. It simply gets taxed. Right ma'am. Look it's important to change that state of mind. How will he so that? Why do you want to live in that room? Ma'am I..- What do you want to prove? Why do you want to live according to other's expectations? It's your life. Right? - Right ma'am. You have to look after yourself first. But.. - Look I suggest that you leave that room. Even I think that you shouldn't stay in that room. But if you think the reason is that there are ghosts there.. ..than I don't agree. Because in the first place we agreed that false beliefs should end. Anyway I wish to tell you an interesting quote. A man noted. A great man. Worth hearing. Because of some incomplete work, or a sudden death the.. ..souls do not achieve freedom. They live in this world. Forever. Come on. I mean in a way every death is a sudden death. And every man who dies leaves something incomplete. Right? It just doesn't make any sense. Except for one. That it is necessary to overcome your fears. Yes sir. Sir? I will live in that room itself. I quiet like the new batch. So do I. - Each has his own views. Charles I think you made the wrong decision. I agree. What's the use? Already once such a thing has taken place in college. Depression After all - Look Meera it was a case of acute depression. And basically ragging related. I am not dead. That room is mine. Abhi? Hey! What's this noise? What is wrong? You are not in the class? Is everything all right? Sir. Sir what do you think? Do spirits exist? - Of course they do. Rum, vodka, whisky. Sir I mean even after the death.. See son. There must be a reason why people believe in them. But I am not believe till.. .. I can't see. Sir, have you ever seen Gaurav? Yes I have. When he was a student here then I have seen him. After his death? No. You have seen him. Because of you being ragged. Even you agree to it. And if I had seen him had I not been ragged then? I don't wish to know about all this Abhi. Sir? Sir have you seen it? What?- Gaurav. Gaurav? Where? - In reflection. Hey! Stop this. Stop this I said. For fever Calpol. And for the throat.. Now what do I do? Okay do one thing.. Pandit? Who had come into my room? Who picked up Gaurav's stuff? Not the seniors I hope? Abhi? See whatever the seniors did with you was wrong. No one wanted this to happen to you. In playing pranks.. - And Gaurav? How can Gaurav come here? Why can't he? I saw him. Gaurav is dead. Gaurav is just a figment of your imagination. Understood? Abhi? Understand what I said. Gaurav is dead. Abhi.. He is there. Can you see him. Not necessary one should be able to see that which is there. Abhimanyu can you yourself understand what you are speaking? Yes sir. What else can I say? I am simple disappointed. Sir but what can I do? First even I dint believe it. What? - Sorry sir. But what's the problem in accepting the truth? I mean. You don't lose anything. There is a problem. I am losing a brilliant student like you. Sir, trust me. I have spoken to him. I have seen him. We were wrong. We were wrong sir.. Sir, trust me. He tells me about himself all the time. Yes? What did he say? He said a lot of things. Sir he said that becoming a doctor was not just his.. ..but his family's dream as well. Getting admission in DMS college was.. .. a dream come true for him. He was very happy. Vaidyaraj Gaurav P Gupte. Kaam Siddhi clinic. Room no. 302. Behind hotel Gold star. Drop in. Or write.- Louder. - Vaidyaraj Gaurav P Gupte. Yes? To get back your lost virility and youth come to.. Vaidyaraj Gaurav P Gupte. Hotel Gold star, Kaam Siddhi clinic. Room no. 302. Drop in. Or write. This must have been taught to you by the seniors. But what is the correct answer? But what is michordia made of? Sir. Muscles. Thickest layer in the heart. Good. Thank you. - That's nice. Thank you. This was a new beginning for him. A new beginning. This is just for you. See. These are the photographs taken under normal conditions. And the ones who have taken the photographs insist that the.. ..odd shapes in these photographs are ghosts or spirits. To be honest. 99% of these are not authentic. It is some sort of graphics or trick photography involved in them. That leaves one percent. If you see the other photographs in front of one of.. .. the lens the strap of camera has come and it has found a shape. And it becomes a ghost. I can give you thousand such examples. See basically science can define everything. This is just a gimmick. To sensationalize things. But sir he is there. We will talk about this tomorrow. But I still think.. I am really sorry sir. We will talk tomorrow. Thank you. Damn it. Meera. What has happened to inverter? Coming. Meera? What is this nonsense? Meera? - One minute I am coming. Meera? - Coming. Be quiet. What is the point of keeping an inverter when it doesn't work? Sarah will wake up speak softly. I have to complete my thesis here. And if this continues then.. And why are there no match sticks here? Why are there no match sticks here? There should be matchsticks. Why aren't they here? What happened in college? Nothing happened in college. Matchsticks should be here. Mother? Oh my baby.. What is the matter? Why are you scared? Sleep. How many times have I told you.. What did I say? - I was scared. - Scared of what? What are you doing? Speaking to a child like that.. - Why? Why are you scared? Mother.. she is scared! When will the inverter work.. Just checking. Stop shouting. What do you mean no? Then how does he start hallucinating? How is he seeing all that again? Sir, trust me. I.. I have stopped. You have stopped? This started because of your ragging. You and your friends are to blame for his condition. And now since you are saying that the ragging has stopped.. ..then how is he hallucinating? How is all this happening? Sir I.. - Hi Chris. What's up? - Hello ma'am.- Hi. Sir I wanted to consult you about some of your articles. Okay. Meet me in office tomorrow. Sit. Sit. And say. Nothing ma'am. Just studying. Really? You said that you were not able to concentrate. No ma'am. No I can. Okay. Abhimanyu? How many horror films have you watched till date?- Why? It's the effect of those movies. Now that Gaurav has spoken to you then he must.. Then he must also have informed you that whom to.. ..take revenge from for his death. There is nothing like that. Then his body must be somewhere. And you have to cremate it. And the heavens.. - I said there is nothing like that. Then how is it? Abhimanyu? He is there. Nothing more. I will come in some time. - Listen. Just stop this nonsense. And come for the lecture. At least pretend to be fine Abhimanyu. I forgot to tell you. I found your bottle of old spice. And that day.. No it was kept near the bag. And from the day I have shifted to that room.. ..people say that you are still there. Great? I mean how is this possible? Hello sir. What are you doing? Nothing. Just like that. He was your batch mate right? What do you think about him? You have made a lot of improvement. Yes. I am really glad. I will see you next week? Take care. - Doctor Meera? I have to talk to you about Abhimanyu. I want to consult you. What is the matter? He says that Gaurav tells him everything about himself. He said that he was beginning to enjoy college life. But he was scared of just one thing. Ragging. Hey! Good morning sir. That day you escaped. But what of today? Sir let me go. Where? You are in a hurry. Sir they are waiting. - Who is waiting? Sir? - Don't you want to be a doctor? Come. We shall be doctors. Come we will go for a round. - Come. Sir please. Don't you want to be a doctor? - Sir, please. I will introduce you to some new friends. Sir. This is your new room. You will live here. Guests are waiting for you. Go. We will meet tomorrow. - Sir. Sir. Sir, please. Sir. So I agree that he is there. No sir not like that. Not because I have said you so. Agree to the fact because it is true. We only believe on end results. That if the telephone rings there is waves and frequencies. If we switch of the telephone do the frequencies fade away? They will be there. You please believe me. - What do you wish to convey? Sir just this that Gaurav has no end. Some mechanical end result doesn't give the proof of his existence. I mean.. And I shall prove it to you that Gaurav is an energy. You are wasting your time and energy on senseless things. In fact I shall prove it to you that how wrong you are. This shall be the perfect solution. Please carry on. Sorry sir for disturbing you. You haven't disturbed me at all. Different researchers have different theories.. About the dreams and their.. ..their interpretations. But actually dreams derive their material from reality. And in the process when it is.. The..- The.. The theory of.. The.. Here. Have your medicines. What happened? What happened? What happened? He can see him. He speaks to him. I have called Abhimanyu to my office. Don't worry I will speak to him. Don't worry. He is becoming like me. Abhimanyu has accepted that Gaurav is there. He is getting comfortable with him. But he doesn't know this.. That after some time Gaurav won't be there. He will just have fear. Fear. He shouldn't become like me. What happened with me? Even I got comfortable after mother's death. She spoke to me even then. And once I accepted the truth then what happened? Just fear was left. Fear. I could see her face everywhere. And I started being scared of my mother. I.. He is becoming like me. Stop it. It's not easy to become like you. Relax. Relax. I will speak to the dean. Just relax. He should change the room. You and me shall get Abhimanyu out of this fix. Just relax. Relax. Okay. Here it's goal. Pass it here- What are you doing? Was just passing it to you.- Run run. Abhi! You also come. No. No sir you play. Do come. The senior juniors are over now. Come let's play. Come. Come on. Come on. No sir. You play. We are fine. What did you say? This wasn't right. This wasn't right. We didn't know. What we didn't know? You didn't know what you were doing? Didn't I know? Yes Chris it was too much. A little bit of ragging.. - What little bit? Were we here to do all this? Little bit. Have you seen his condition? Yes. His condition is bad. What do we do? - What? Is there anything left to be done now? He is ill. Here take your medicine. Take it. You are ill since long. Have it. All this is your imagination. Sir, that is.. In fact he is sitting with me now. After all we are roommates. Aren't we Gaurav? Sir he has given me more information about himself. Which I wanted to tell you. Sir he told me that after that night he shut himself up in his room. Away from other people. But still the ragging continued. Slowly he began thinking of himself as lonely and weak. Yes? Grandmother was going to come? Yes I will come to meet her. By Saturday. Bye mother. But sir Gaurav believes that by taking one wrong step.. ..he ended everything. Killing himself was his biggest mistake. Abhimanyu.. ..I am actually worried a lot about you. I think you need help. Honestly you are heading towards a very serious medical condition. Then sir what would you say about Gaurav's mother's condition. Who still thinks that her son is alive.. Look it's also a mental disease. How do you know about Gaurav's mother? Sir because I went to meet her. She still thinks that her son in studying in the college. Look she gave me these books to pass onto Gaurav. Can I keep this? Sure sir. Abhimanyu.. I will see to it that you recover completely. I promise. May I come in ma'am? Come Chris. Coffee? No thanks ma'am. If you have some work, then tell me. No, I called you here for the coffee. If you don't want to drink it then you can leave. You wished to say something? Okay ma'am. Bye. Chris. Chris. Come. Come sit. Thanks. You have spoiled yourself by ragging. I have left all this. And since when did you start writing articles? And getting them checked? You are the topper since 4 years. You have no need for such things. Anyway. Forget it. I have a patient. Meenakshi. You must have seen her. She is an unusual patient. I want to treat her in an unconventional fashion. I want to give her shock therapy. I don't want anyone to know. Can you help me? Chris? Please. I am asking it. But ma'am.. - And if Anirudh says then.. Yes? No. Yes I will do it now. Yes I am just coming. Coming. Abhimanyu's report. Bipolar. There were traits before. Because of Chris's ragging it's full blown. What do you think? What should we do about Chris? I asked you something. Why? You yourself said.. ..that speak politely. It's his final year. Why Anirudh? Just for one thesis. You were his favourite professor. You have used Abhimanyu. Like a guinea pig. Why? Self cure is also one thing. I did that. Abhimanyu? Sir you? Come. For you I have done something that was considered.. Impossible since ages. Chris? You and Anirudh have ruined the name of student teacher relationship. Sir? It was just an experiment. I chose a subject. Selected him. Kept him in that room. Made others rag him. He just wanted to destroy the fear and terror by a .. ..scientific approach. He simply wanted to ridicule the paranormal. Repetitive information and association caused him.. ..to hallucinate. How was I to know that Abhimanyu would.. .. deteriorate to this state? It was a mistake. I was just helping in the theses. Even after information was cut off.. ..he could see him. But I have solved it. I am ready to face the consequences. I believed in him. I am really sorry. It's all in the mind. And after all thoughts become things. Right? Have you seen Anirudh? Have you seen him anywhere? Doctor Meera? - Have you seen him? What he is saying? - Yes he is.. He is right. Anirudh is in manic phase. No one is safe with him. He is dangerous. He can do anything. Sit. Late start from beginning. You knew that the room was so called haunted. Why did you choose to stay in that room? Sir because I thought that Gaurav is a rumour. You thought. Now what do you think? That he is there for sure. Why? Because I have spoken to him. I have seen him. You told me so. When did all this start? I think it was the time Gaurav knocked on my door. But you said that maybe seniors did that. No sir. That was Gaurav. Really? Why would he do that? Because the room is his. I mean I live in his room. You believe in it. - The entire college thinks so. The entire college thinks that the room is not yours but Gaurav's? Not exactly but.. Well. If I am not wrong then your ragging started in relation with Gaurav? Yes sir. Seniors told me.. ..to collect all his information. So you collected the information? Sir I had no other option. What did you come to know? Everything about him. From his date of birth to everything else. Why did you go to meet his parents? To find out if even they could feel him. Can they see him as well? And what did you come to know? His mother is still not ready to believe that he is dead. Abhimanyu whatever you have said about Gaurav till now.. ..is correct. But you believe that Gaurav speaks to you? Yes. When we are alone. I want to show you something. I am sorry I kept you under surveillance. But I had to keep You under observation. But see.. Abhimanyu a wise guy.. ..Is behaving like a fool. He is standing alone in the corridor and speaking to himself. But sir? - What but? And. What is this? Sir diary.- From where did I get this? From my room. And room where did you get this? Sir Gaurav's mother gave me to pas onto him. Read. Read it. Sir it's Gaurav's personal diary. And what is written in it? Read. I will tell you. In this is written Gaurav's personal life. His college life. His hostel life. His depression. His ragging. Everything is written. Isn't it? - sir? Isn't it? Read. Read. Sir becoming a doctor was not just mine but my family's dream. Exactly. You told me exactly the same thing. That Gaurav told you so.. Is that written in this or no? Yes or no? Yes it is written. - Good. Gaurav is an image which has formed in your brain. After thinking about him for 24 hours. And then whatever you hear in college is affecting you. Like this room is his and not yours. But sir.. - Yes or no? All that is written here Gaurav tells you. You say this. And what do you want to hear? What do you want to see? You wish to end up in a mental asylum? People label you as mad? And what is this? These are your test reports. Bipolar disorder. Suspected bipolar disorder. You are simply hallucinating. I think maybe you are right. Gaurav was nothing but my imagination. Maybe? No you are right. And you are wrong? Yes sir. I was wrong. Gentlemen I rest my case. What a show! Amazing! Amazing! Very amazing. Thanks. Thank you sir. Actually the room which you have taken was closed for.. ..the past three years. Just because of fear. And you have proven them wrong.- Thank you sir. He was ragged. Don't worry. You are my responsibility. We are under surveillance 24 hours. One day I shall prove it to you that you think wrong. It's necessary to destroy your fears. I will see to it that you recover completely. We are just puppets. Basically it is a psychiatric disorder. Characterised by one or more episodes of elevated mania.. ..at one end and the episodes of depression at the other. As. Abhimanyu? Look I did what was necessary. Not just for you but for the society. When you work for the better of mankind then in the scheme.. ..of things some individuals suffer. Collateral damage. Why did you use Gaurav? And Abhimanyu.. Look you are not getting me. Sir I can prove you wrong even now. Look Abhimanyu you are missing the point. What we did will create history. We were into this experiment together. Open this. Did you remember something? Some incomplete work.. some incomplete work.. ..Or sudden death your soul doesn't get freedom. And it stays with us forever. No. Not there. Not there. I did tell you there is nothing like that. What you see is wrong. It's wrong. Everything is wrong. You are bipolar. I am telling you. I am telling you. It's nothing. I tell you . It's severe case of bipolar disorder. I am telling you. It's nothing. It's your imagination. You can see someone. But that doesn't mean he is there. So. It's not there. So? How? Not there. Not possible. No.. how? No.
