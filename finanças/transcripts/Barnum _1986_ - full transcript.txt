[ragtime piano music] - [Voiceover] [mumbles], good evening, madam! May I kiss your hand, madam? - Have you a lovely time this evening. [mumbles]! Hold it, hold it, who's this one over here?! Are you ready? One, two, three! Up up, there you go! [rapid drumming] [applause] - Thank you. Thank you! Barnum's the name. PT Barnum. And I want to tell you that tonight on this stage I'm going to show you every sight and wonder that name stands for. Including Jumbo, the largest elephant in the world. The amazing great white whale from Labrador. General Tom Thumb, only 25 inches from toe to crown. Joyce Heth, oldest woman alive. And the rarest and most beautiful bird in captivity, the Swedish nightingale. Plus a cast of hundreds. No, thousands, including marching bands, standing bands, tumbling bands, flying bands, bands of every size, shape and description. And here they are. [grand music] [applause] Ah, no, no, no, no, no. I know what you're thinking. You don't see any nightingales or flying bands, or 25 inch men. But like I told ya, Barnum's the name and humbug's my game. Wait a minute, where you going? - Home. - Home? - But I have a point of view to expound, defending the noble art of humbug. - Which I happen to be in disagreement with as it's no more than a shoddy defense of flimflam. So it doesn't behoove me to stick around. - Respect for the speaker madam requires that you listen while he sets forth his convictions. - And respect for my own convictions requires me to set forth, which I am doing. - All right, then go, go. Isolated dissent can hardly deter me. One small voice can quiet easily be ignored. - Good day Mr. Barnum. - Of course it doesn't help any if that one small voice happens to belong to his wife. [laughing] Charity Barnum, I'll have a kiss before you leave. - With pleasure, Mr. Barnum. [applause] You may not make much sense, but you're beautiful. [whistle blows] - Ladies and gentlemen, in the main ring the fight to the finish struggle of humbug versus truth. Flimflam versus fact. Mr. Phineas Taylor Barnum versus his good wife Charity. An American pageant featuring stirring music, thrilling spectacle, hilarious clowns and savage jungle beasts. [applause] But first presenting Mr. Barnum himself in an opening bit of philosophical falderal! Mr. Barnum! - Well the fact is my wife is a perfect example of what I'm talking about. You give her a mess of hard facts, she's happy as a clam. Serve her up a little fancy, she turns up her nose like it was yesterday's fish. I'll bet she's not the only one here tonight, but whether you end up thinking that humbug is a blessing or a curse, you're still gonna buy it. Why? Because every 60 seconds in this world a delightful phenomenon takes place which absolutely guarantees it.

[applause] - Here it is in Mr. Webster's Dictionary Taylor. Humbug, something designed to deceive or mislead. - See, that's what comes in marrying a schoolteacher, they go right to the books. Chairy, I'm talking about the kind of humbug them pilgrim fathers sold themselves when they set sail on The Mayflower. The belief in rosy possibilities, the dream, Chairy. - Just one thing, Taylor. This lady with no nose, how does she smell? - Awful. [laughing] - Mr. Webster also gives a nice synonym for humbug, lies. - Aw Chairy. - But don't give up Taylor, the evening's young. You've still got some rosy possibilities. [whistle blows] - Rosy possibilities. - [Horace] In the far ring, humble beginnings. PT Barnum in his first appearance in the main tent turns oil into gold quicker than you can say George Washington! [upbeat trumpet music] - I'm telling you, they came by the thousands in Philadelphia, Mr. Barnum. - Uh huh. - Now here's all the papers you'll need. Birth certificate, bill of sale, and writs and testimony proving beyond the shadow of a doubt that on June 15th, Joice Heth will be 160 years old. - Yeah, well she'd better be, Mr. Lyman, it's taken every last cent I've got to buy this contract, but from now on P.T. Barnum presents Joice Heth, the oldest woman in the world! - She'll make you a fortune, Mr. Barnum! Just remember, Philadelphia! - All right, Joice, we'd better get to work if we're gonna eat tonight. All right, step right up and see her, folks! Joice Heth, the oldest woman in the world! There she is, lady! Now 25 cents is your place at the front of the line here. All right, come on now, who's gonna be the first customer of the day? Lady, lady! Hey, you're not as young as you used to be? This lady here, she'll make you feel like a spring chicken is what we do. - How dare you?! [laughing] - You're flat, Joice, you're flat. [laughs] Sir, sir, all alone, nowhere to go? You're flat, woman, you're flat! Up a bit, up a bit! Oh sit down, sit down! Sir, sir, you like older women? [laughing] Come on, this act can't last forever. We could be gone next week. [loud thud] Joice! I don't understand it, they came by the thousands in Philadelphia. - And walked by by the thousands. You've been had, Mr. Barnum. - Oooh! - Anyway, what's so special about an old lady? A young lady, now well that's different. If you'd a' had me up here 140 years ago, they would've come all right. - What did you say? - I said what's so special about an old lady. - No no no, you said 140 years ago? George Washington! - Mr. Barnum, what you looking at honey? - I'm looking at a nanny, a nanny a long time ago, she's got a little baby boy bouncing on her knee. George Washington! - But I don't know no people named Washington. - George Washington, the father of our country? - But I never tended George Washington-- - Joice! That sidewalk looks a might hard for us to sleep on tonight, and I would say there was the strongest possibility of rain, maybe even hail. - What'd you say that boy's name was? - George Washington. - Oh, you means little Georgie. [laughing] Why Mr. Barnum, I pretty near raised that boy! - All right Joice, let's do it! Step right up and see her folks, Joice, that's George's Washington's nanny! ♪ When you see the shape the world is in ♪ When the way it is ain't what it's been ♪ When folks just care for gold ♪ Thank God I'm old ♪ When you take a gander at the news ♪ When you hear the language people use ♪ When no sweet songs are sung ♪ I don't wanna be young - Liven it up, Joice! ♪ Daddy time he doesn't fret me ♪ Should he spy me, that don't upset me ♪ Let him eye me, come and get me ♪ That's fine by me, age don't worry me ♪ When you see the way folks misbehave ♪ When it's only good times that they crave ♪ When kids are much too bold ♪ Thank God, I'm old ♪ When there ain't no He-Men left alive ♪ When they tell you three men out of five ♪ End up locked up or hung ♪ I don't wanna be young - All right, dance Joice. - But I can't dance, I'm 160 years old. - Rain, hail, maybe a blizzard! - I'll dance. - Let's do it. Wind up slow now. That's it, come back here. Now sell it. Sell it! Sell it! Start at the top of the hill, I'll give you a push. Here she goes. Hang onto my arm. Stand up straight! Start with the left, that one. [cheering] That a girl, back! I'm sorry! - Let me tell you about the day Georgie discovered America. - That was Christopher Columbus! - I tended him too. - No you didn'! One more! Now we're going home! Hang onto my arm. There she goes, everyone! ♪ Gonna get me dressed and powdered down ♪ Call myself a hack and go to town - All the way! ♪ See every shady street ♪ These feet once strolled ♪ Then I'm gonna slip back on the shelf ♪ Have a little nip and tell myself ♪ Though my back buckles and bends ♪ My hair got silvery ends ♪ When I see all of my friends ♪ Laid out and cold ♪ Thank God, I'm old [applause] - That is great, Joice! Great! All right, back on the truck. That's it, good girl. That's it, you relax. Take her two blocks down! And give her some resuscitation! All right, maybe I mislead them a bit, but most of those folks went home thinking that they shook the hand that held the rosy bottom of the father of our country. That is what is known as a patriotic humbug, and there's none finer. Well now that Joice was a success, I started signing up new attractions, but of course I had to find some place to put them. - That's right, Mr. Barnum. I'm selling you a full partnership in the American Museum, but I'm warning you, my rock bottom price is $15,000. - And worth every penny of it, Mr. Scudder. The full amount will be paid out of the first year's profits, and should I fall behind I will forfeit all my attractions to your good self. - Very well, Mr. Barnum, but I don't wanna turn the museum into no sideshow. - I couldn't agree with you more, sir. That's why I intend rebuilding the entire museum and filling all five floors with the most educational attractions imaginable including three galleries of art, a lecture hall sitting 2,000 people, and in the rotunda, a glass tank containing a living, breathing, spouting great white whale from Lavador. Just to help you make up your mind, sir, may I present you with one courtesy ticket entitling you and a friend to free admissions upon payment of half the normal price on any Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday between the hours of 12 noon and 1PM. Is that a deal, sir? - [Charity] Taylor Barnum! Did you or did you not invite me all the way from Bridgeport to have lunch with you at one o'clock sharp?! It is not past 2:15! [whistle blows] - In the center ring, ladies and gentlemen, PT Barnum faces that most ferocious of all jungle beasts, the female of the species who was being kept waiting over one hour and 15 minutes! Mr. Barnum will now face this most dangerous creature. [drum rolling] [laughing] And arm! - Mr. Scudder, did I not ask you to tell me when it was one o'clock? - One o'clock? - Now please sir, no excuses, run along, I'll see you at the museum at 2:45 with the builders and please be prompt. Chairy, I don't know I ever took him on as a partner, he's so unreliable! Now that is what is known as a matrimonial humbug. The only trouble is, with my wife, it never works. - Hogwash, Taylor, I believe you forgot that appointment all by yourself. Now I have some pamphlets to collect at the Women's Emancipation Society, they have a lovely tea room, I think we'll lunch there. - Oh no no, I can't eat there! McNalley's Saloon is right around the corner. - Nonsense, Taylor, you don't need a drink, you need some good decent food inside you. - Not liver and prunes, please! - Very well then Taylor, I suggest we leave it up to the Fates. Heads, the Women's Emancipation Society, tails McNalley's Saloon. - All right! I'll toss it if you don't mind. - Go right ahead, Taylor, I trust you 100%. [laughing] - Liver and prunes. [orchestral music] [applause] - Hey! [applause] [applause] - Hello, Mrs. Barnum. - Our new pamphlet's all about the Stanton Act, now thanks to Elizabeth Katie Stanton, the state of New York now guarantees a woman the right to make all her own business and legal decisions. - What do you think of that, Mr. Barnum? - Oh I'm all for it 100%. Long as she asks her husband first. [laughing] Now could we have half a dozen oysters here and two large ales please. - I'm sorry, Mr. Barnum, liver's the special today. Plus fresh boiled parsnips and a kompot of prunes. - Sounds delicious, we'll have two. - I shall be up for days. [laughing] - Now Taylor, you can tell me about this new partner of yours. - Chairy, Amos Scudder and I are gonna rebuild the American Museum. - With what, we haven't $100 to our name. - With brass and a bit of humbug, you'd be surprised too often is just as good as silver or gold. - Schemes again, Taylor, schemes and dreams! - But that's my nature, Chairy, I told you I was a dreamer the first night I met you. - Taylor Barnum, when a girl meets a man in the middle of the worst thunderstorm of the summer with bolts of lightning jumping off every tree and barn in sight, a thunder so loud it nearly scares you out of your wits, she don't pay much mind when a man happens to mention he's a dreamer. I'm not saying you shouldn't have dreams, Taylor, just let them be sensible ones we can reach. - But I want to excite people, I want to give them a glimpse of the miracle! - Miracle's a pretty fancy word for humbug, Taylor. - Oh that's not fair! I may put a high polish on the facts-- - I don't mind you using the imagination the good Lord gave you, but with two daughters to bring up you oughta be using it for more sensible things. Now I happen to know that they're looking for a new partner at the Bridgeport Clock Factory, I could be part of it, Taylor. - No, Chairy, no, I can't do that! Tick, tock, tick from 10 to 6 every day? With only an occasional bong to break the monotony? Of 10,000 cuckoos looking out of 10,000 little holes? Every man's got a tympanum, Mrs. Barnum. Mine is just not suited to tick, tock, cuckoo, and bong! - I'm sorry Taylor, I shouldn't have brought it up. - Of course you should, Chairy, of course you should. That's half a wife's job, bringing up things a husband doesn't wanna hear. No, it's just that the clockworks, it isn't the right color for me. Say the words, Bridgeport Clockworks, what do you see? Grays and browns. But you step inside any sideshow, you've got fire engine red, kelly green, butter yellow! It's like being inside a giant pinwheel! Oh and it's not for my own selfish reasons I need all them colors, Chairy.

Chairy! I'll be back in five minutes! Well 15 at the most! And a half hour at the outside! Chairy, if I'm not back by six, why don't you come down to the museum, you can't miss it, it's on the corner of Anne Street and Broadway, it's got a big purple sign with gold letters and red trimming that says Barnum's America Museum! ♪ The splendor of a sunrise ♪ The dazzle of a flame ♪ The glory of a rainbow ♪ I'd put 'em all to shame - I'm gonna do this, just hang on there [applause] - It's your own fault, Charity Barnum.

[goofy carnival music] That's a pile. I know it's a bicycle! Get those other bricks! Come back here with that bicycle! Stop! Get outta here! Stop! Oh Chairy, I've bitten off more than I can chew. - Nonsense. - Have you forgotten we got an opening Monday morning at nine? - We'll be ready! - You intend rebuilding an entire museum in two days? - I do, my treasure. - But how? - Slowly. - Look at this mess! ♪ The Lord gave each and everyone ♪ The spunk to do what can't be done ♪ The brawn, the brain, the courage and the heart ♪ The strength to bend the strongest bar ♪ The will to reach the farthest star ♪ It's just a case of learning how to start ♪ To build a tower up so high to a cloud you'll anchor ♪ Build it one tiny brick at a time ♪ Bucks multiply 'till a bum's a banker ♪ Just begin with a thin silver dime ♪ That empty field, it can yield ♪ Miles and miles of flowers ♪ You don't need no magic powers ♪ Just a seed and showers ♪ From the floor to the sky ♪ You can soar if you're wise enough to climb ♪ One brick at a time - Come on, you guys, let's try it!

Whose kept my crazy world from going up in smoke these past 14 years. Happy Anniversary. - I might have been foolish enough to marry you, Taylor, but that doesn't mean I can't count. Our anniversary isn't for six months. - Not ours, the museum's! Ooooh! Have you forgotten exactly one year ago today we opened our doors to the public? So I want you to go put on your best silks and satins, woman, because tonight I'm gonna take you, me, and those pearls to celebrate at the 5th Avenue restaurant in New York City! - Oh I'm sorry Mr. Barnum, but I'm not going to any 5th Avenue restaurant. The food's too rich, the people too fancy, and I don't even wanna discuss the prices. I'm staying right here! - Marital humbug number two. This one never fails. [laughing] Chairy Barnum, I'm married to the prettiest woman in the state of Connecticut! It's my God given right to take her out and show her off if I want to. Now either you go and put on your best dress at once or certain very costly anniversary gifts are gonna have to be returned! [laughing] Well it almost never fails.

But it isn't to show off these pearls to your fancy New York friends, it's because I'm still in love with you, you great fool! And I want one of your damn martial humbugs to succeed! - Charity Barnum, I have never humbugged you! Why I'm surprised that you even suggested such a thing! - Mr. Barnum. - Not now, Mr. Scudder, can't you see I'm lying to my wife? [laughing] Mr. Scudder! What on Earth brings you all the way out here from New York City this time of night, sir? Mr. Scudder? Is something wrong, sir? - A fire, Mr. Barnum. At the museum. - What?! - It's no use. There's nothing left. I'm sorry, Mr. Barnum. - Mr. Scudder, I hope I'm being humbugged, sir. - Alas, Mr. Barnum, you never taught me how. - Now Taylor, I tell you right now I don't intend dancing any gallops, I haven't had time to change my petticoat and it's the same old [mumbles] one, but since the only dance you know is the Waltz, I don't anticipate any... Problems. - The evening's off, Chairy. No use celebrating a museum that's burned down. Oh you were right. It was nothing but a darn sideshow anyhow. - Taylor Barnum! That museum was absolutely splendid! For what it was, I'll not listen to anything to the contrary! New York's not the only place to making a living you know. There are lots of other places. There's a whole country out there! Why right here is the Bridgeport Clock Factory! - Darn it, Charity Barnum if you haven't come up with a solution! There is a whole country out there! Here I am piddling my life away on the corner of Anne Street and Broadway, there've gotta be what, two dozen states never even heard of PT Barnum! I'll build a new museum, I'll put it on wheels! - Oh no, Taylor, I wasn't thinking about any two dozen states, the Bridgeport Clock Factory is-- - I'll bring a load of red and gold to the entire country! I can start with a three month swing around the East, all I need is some capital and a headline attraction! And because it was your idea! - What?! - Because it was your idea, I'm gonna put a top line on every ad: Entire tour under the personal supervision of Mr. And Mrs. PT Barnum! - Ooh! - [Taylor] Chairy? You are with me on this, aren't you? - Well Taylor, I am not sure that I am 100% in accord. - Then everything's all right! We're quarreling again. [laughing] ['I Like Your Style' instrumental] - I hope I'm not interrupting, Mr. Barnum. - You are, Mr. Stratton. - But our appointment was for two o'clock. - I'm busy right now, sir. - [Stratton] Then why don't we forget it? My wife and I have a few moral qualms about your offer anyway. - Monday morning at nine, Mr. Stratton. - Good day, Mr. Barnum. - All right, damn it! Chairy, I gotta see him. He's got that headline attraction I told you about, now you go on dancing. I'll be back in two shakes. ["I Like Your Style" flute instrumental] - [Horace] And now a deliciously droll divertism as PT Barnum juggles three slippery Strattons in the air! - All right, Mr. Stratton, now what's this about moral qualms? - Let me begin by telling you that my wife and I have the highest regard for you. - But to permit you to exploit our son Charles' oddities for such a small sum of money is an offense to the Christian conscience. - Now the key word in that speech isn't Christian. It's small, as in sum of money. Exactly what do you mean when you refer to oddities, Mrs. Stratton? - Any boy only 25 inches tall from head to toe is a freak of nature. - Joice Heth is 160 years old. Madam Josepe has a 10 inch beard, Anne Swan is eight and a half feet tall. That doesn't make them freaks, Mrs. Stratton. It makes them special. What you call an aberration of nature, I call a gift from God to lift them above the crowd. Now since the young man is old enough to make up his own mind, why don't we ask him. Well, Charlie, I want you to come with me and join my show. But I'm not gonna fool you. I mean 10s, thousands, maybe millions of people are gonna come and see you. Some to stare, maybe even a few to laugh, but most, most are gonna cheer and they're gonna tell their children and grandchildren for generations to come that they once saw the smallest man in the world. And we'll find a special name to go with the miracle of your size. Course you mustn't forget the other benefits, there's gonna be senators, presidents, bishops all knocking at your door wanting to talk to you. Or you can stay safe and snug in that chair for the rest of your life. Never moving from one day to the next. It's up to you, Charlie. Now what do you say? That's it! That's the name! Thumb! Tom Thumb! - [Horace] Ladies and gentlemen of the great city of Philadelphia! For the first time anywhere, the world's smallest man, General Tom Thumb!

Tom Thumb may be the smallest man on Earth, but you've managed to tell some pretty tall tales about him. - Oh woman! - You know what this tour needs is at least one respectable attraction. - Now don't start that again, we're gonna miss the Chicago train! - Very well then, the children are with their suitcases in the waiting room, you collect them and I'll meet you on the platform. - Chairy, Chairy, collecting children is what you do. - Right now Mr. Barnum I have other fish to fry. The Women's Emancipation Society! - What, are they following me around the country? The liver and prunes club. What is this? - One of those feminist get togethers, Mr. Barnum. You can't go into the street without stumbling over 'em. - I'm sorry? - Goldschmidt, Julius Goldschmidt. We met in New York last autumn when you saw my tour with [mumbles]. - Of course, Mr. Goldschmidt. So what do these ladies want now? - Power to the homemaker or some such nonsense. What the poor creatures don't realize is they got all the power in the world if they'd learn how to use it. - I don't follow you, sir. - Well what does a wife want the vote for when she can have her husband's? - Oooh ho ho ho. - I'll give you an example of the kind of woman I'm talking about. A little lady I'm going over to England next month to sign up, Miss Jenny Lind. - Lind? - She just finished her second command performance for Queen Victoria. - Lind, Lind, of course! The India rubber lady who can tie a knot in her right arm! - Jenny Lind is an opera singer, Mr. Barnum. And she ties men in knots. ♪ A cheek as fair as falling snow ♪ Two eyes that hold a special glow ♪ A sigh as soft as summer wind ♪ A trembling smile, Miss Jenny Lind ♪ - New York train's almost here. I must be on my way, Mr. Barnum. - Mr. Goldschmidt. - Taylor, just wait until you read what's in this pamphlet! Votes for women, rights of ownership, even letting a woman hold a man's job if she's qualified. - Chairy, you want a man's job? How would you like to run the rest of the tour by yourself? - What would you be doing? - Taking a boat ride, now you're always on about me getting a respectable attraction, well I just got wind of one. A miss Jenny Lind. - The opera singer? [laughing] - Right. The only thing is I gotta get to English right away to beat out the competition, now what do you say? - Well it's not the same as running something solid like the Bridgeport Clock Factory, but it's a challenge and I accept! Well you'd better get a move on, Taylor, it's only four minutes to train time and you'd better hurry if you wanna board on the next train to New York. - Now wait a minute, wait a minute! Are you sure we're doing the right thing? I know we're not satisfied with the status quo, but at least we're used to it. - Very well then Taylor, we'll leave it up to the Fates. Tails we'll continue the tour together, heads you go to England. Bon Voyage, Mr. Barnum. - It's uncharted territory, Mrs. Barnum. - I'm equal to it, Taylor, and so are you. [trumpets blare] - Well I wasn't too late. I could've missed that train, followed Chairy West, but I didn't. I made the train, I made the boat, and I made the deal with Miss Lind's representatives. But just who humbugged who that time? I have yet to find out. Two questions remain unanswered. How was PT Barnum gonna sell an opera singer to the American public? And... Who the hell was Jenny Lind? [laughing] Like that fella Shakespeare said, what's in a name anyhow? It's titles the public wants, so I shall call her the Scintillating Songbird from Scandinavia! [laughing] Well it's not that bad. [laughing] The Songbird who Scintillates from Sweden! I know that one's bad. All right, I got it! I got it! The Singing Swede! You like that? I like that too. Unfortunately, Chairy had already had the handbills printed, so we were stuck with calling her The Swedish Nightingale! [laughing] - Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time on these blessed shores, the world renowned Swedish Nightingale. Due to the extremely respectable nature of this attraction, Mr. Barnum's promotional campaign will refrain from any sensational claims and rely on the plain unvarnished truth! [upbeat carnival music] [soft violin music] - PT Barnum, Miss Lind, welcoming you on behalf of over 1,233,00 American citizens to... [laughing] To New York City. [laughing] Did you have a nice crossing? [speaking Swedish] [laughing] - Come again? [laughing] [speaking Swedish] - She can't speak a word of English. Did you know she couldn't speak a word of English?! Miss Lind, Miss Lind, this here, this here is the United States of America! Here we try and speak English! [speaking Swedish] We're in serious trouble! Horace, prepare that stage. Miss Lind, Miss Lind, you have to give a concert on this stage. [speaking Swedish] No, in English, Miss Lind, in English! - I no want to learn English. - Well you have no choice! - Choose? - No, choice! - Choose! - Choice! - Choice. - Good. [laughing] - Gide. - Good! - Gide! - Good! - Good. - That's good. - No good! - Good evening. - Eveningk. - Evening! - Evening! - Ladies! - Lettuce! - Not lettuce! Lettuce you eat! It's ladies! - Ladies. - And. - Und. - And! - And! - Gentlemen! - Yentlamen. - Gentlemen! - Yentlamen. - Yentlamen! - Good! - Just smile, Miss Lind, just smile. No American can resist the smile of a beautiful woman. No American man anyhow. Right, now I am going out to the front of the theater, I hope you have a pleasant concert. I hope I have a pleasant concert. Quiet! That's the best they've played all week. [speaking Swedish] In English, Miss Lind, in English! [trumpets blare] [operatic singing] - Good evening, ladies and... Gentlemen. [operatic singing] [applause] - Bravo! Bravo, Miss Lind! Wonderful, well played, sir! - Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Lind thanks you for your kind reception of her programs and asks if she might sing one last song. A song she performed at her first concert in Sweden and dedicates tonight to a new American friend.

Many gentlemen ask go with me to the reception tonight and I not know which one to choose. - Well my day lady, you pick whoever takes your fancy. - Very well. I choose... A scholastic person. My English teacher. - Well now my dear lady, I... Am a confusion. - Congratulations, Miss Lind. Taylor, the carriage is waiting. - I'll be right there, Chairy. - It's not important. The mayor of the city also ask go with me. - Well he's a fine gentleman. - Taylor, please hurry, I want to freshen up at the hotel before the reception. - Of course. - Ah well, perhaps another time. - Chairy. Chairy, I got me a problem. The receipts have gotta be counted again. The darn bookkeeper messed up. Why don't you take the carriage and I'll see you later. - Very well then, Taylor. I'll see you when I see you. It was a great success tonight. I'm very proud of you. Goodnight, my darling. Goodnight, Miss Lind. - Chairy! Miss Lind! Damn it, why shouldn't I take another reception?! Hell, it's just for a few hours! All my life I spent selling the green to everyone else in the world, isn't it time that I got a look at it myself? I'm a man, I got the price of admission!

And she says since President Filmore's a stickler for punctuality-- - Damn it Wilton, don't I get one evening off a week? All six months of this tour has been nothing but tea with the President, supper with the Senator, reception with the Chief Justice. When do they find time to run the country? I tell you I'd give the whole thing up tomorrow just to get away from them. - Oh you don't mean that, Mr. Barnum. - Oh yes I do. Mr. Goldschmidt's been after me to buy Miss Lind's contract. I have a damn good mind to sell it to him. I humbugged myself into thinking I needed a respectable attraction, I humbugged myself into thinking I needed some color in my life. Now look at me. It's a miserable state of affairs if you ask me. I should be being respectable to someone I love. Wilton, I want you to send a wire to Mr. Goldschmidt telling him I'll see him in New York day after tomorrow. And another to Mrs. Barnum telling her if that coin comes up heads, I might just be in Bridgeport end of next week. Well none of my female of the species humbugs ever seem to pan out, but I'm too old a dog not to try. It's a disgrace if you ask me. Complete and utter disgrace. - Can hears you muttering. - Me muttering? I never mutter. Height of impoliteness, muttering. - Then I'll just ignore it. - If I got something to utter, I utter it. I never mutter. I might sputter, but I never mutter. I used to mutter, I used to have a mutter. [laughing] How many times do I tell ya, keep your hands out my pants! [laughing] - I think I know what this is about. The way the French ambassador smiled at me last night. - Wrong, what do I care if some weaselly looking Frenchie smiles at you? It's the way you smile at him. One of those number two special trembling ones. - Phineas, I'm a soprano and we flirt. - No, the left foot goes on the left foot and the right foot goes on the right foot. [laughing] - [mumbles]. Anyway, what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. - What are you talking about? - The letters. - [Taylor] What letters? - Long ones, very, to a lady in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Now if you were willing to give up these letters, I might be willing to give my trembling smiles. [violin music] - Jenny. Jenny, I want you to know I'll never forget you. - It has been a lovely six months. [speaking Swedish] I want for you what you want for yourself. - That's a very kind wish, Jenny. Now all I gotta do is figure out exactly what it is I do want. - Well at least we know what it isn't. ♪ This game of love amuses ♪ Unless of course one loses - When do you think you'll be leaving? - Well tonight's as good a time as any. Will you be all right? - I think so. I have a dinner engagement. With the French ambassador. ♪ Wish men and fools playing love's game ♪ Bend to the same sweet reason - Have you seen the figures for St. Louis, Mr. Goldschmidt? Sold out two months before she even hits town. I tell you, sir, I'm selling you a songbird that lays golden eyes. - I know that, Mr. Barnum. In fact you might say that I knew that before you did. - Well that's why I'm making you such a generous deal, sir. Just one proviso. If Miss Lind ever plays Bridgeport, you better not sell me any tickets. Done? - Done. ♪ Love makes such fools of us ♪ All - Why Charity Barnum, what are you doing here? - It came up heads.

What's the matter, you all right? - Yes, I just need to rest a moment. - It's that damn campaign, you're worn out. Come, let's sit down here. - On the steps of the city hall, that's illegal! - Well I'll make that my first job as mayor. That all elected officials with beautiful wives are allowed to sit on the steps of the city hall as long as I'm in office. [chuckling] Take it easy now. Is that better? - Thank you very much, Mayor Barnum. - You're very very welcome, Mrs. Barnum. Isn't that an impressive place? - It's the most respectable looking building I've ever seen. And it belongs to you now. - Aw Chairy, you know sitting here looking at that smiling face reminds me of the very first night I met you in that thunderstorm. I know you were frightened, but I just kept wishing there'd be more lightning so I could get another look at your face. - I shut my eyes every time the lightning flashed, so I never did get a good look at you until we were standing at the alter, and by then it was too late. [laughing] - What are you saying to me? - Oh Taylor, folks are gonna think we're foolish, two old people sitting on these steps in the middle of the night holding hands. - Who says we're old? I may have a few laugh lines. One or two gray hairs. But you don't a day older than the day I met you. - I thought you were through with humbug. - 22 or three at the most. That is the least humbugging thing I've ever said in my life. - Taylor, you're gonna be wonderful at politics. [laughing] Course I don't expect you to be mayor for more than one term, I've already got my eye on a senate seat. Not the state senate either. - You're talking about Washington? - Heads say you can do it, Taylor. - Oh come on now, you don't tossing a coin on whether you run for the US Senate! That takes pondering, contemplating, considering! And how come in 25 years of tossing that coin it never once came up tails, may I ask? - I guess fate is just on my side, Taylor. That and the fact that this quarter just happens to have two heads. [laughing] - What are you saying to me? You stacked the deck on me, Charity Barnum? - I haven't been watching you for 25 years for nothing, Taylor. - All right! All right, I'll run for your damn senate for you 'cause I love ya and I'd do anything in this world to make you happy, but I am most displeased, Mrs. Barnum, most displeased.

'Cause during this campaign I'm gonna be stronger than ever. We worked a long time for this nomination. It's an election I don't plan on losing. - Mr. Barnum, I'm afraid there's been a slight postponement on your nomination. - What? - What Mr. Templeton is trying to say is that the party's position has changed. We're giving the nomination to Alexander Whitaker. - What are you talking about? What are you talking about, I've been barnstorming this past six months on the strength of the promise of this nomination. - The decision is out of our hands, Mr. Barnum, but in four years you'll be a prime candidate. - I don't want the nomination in four years, I promised somebody I'd be in Washington in January, if I can't be there then, I don't wanna be there at all! Good day, gentlemen! - But Mr. Barnum-- - [Taylor] Good day, gentlemen! They took me, Chairy, they took me! Six months of making speeches and they take that nomination away from me with a lie worst than any humbug I've pulled on anyone in 35 years of fooling people! I thought I got it out my life, but I haven't. 'Cause it looks like if I don't humbug them, they're gonna do worse to me. And tell me, Chairy, is humbugging so bad after all? Look at... Look at Abraham Lincoln! Back in '61, he was humbug with a vision of a whole society of free and equal people. And that dream was strong enough to win him a war! Well not that I'm comparing four headed frogs and live mermaids with The Gettysburg Address, but... You gotta admit that somewhere way down deep there's gotta be a connection. [laughing] How do you like that? Two minutes up here on a soapbox, already I'm convinced I'm second cousins with Abraham Lincoln. Aw darn it, Chairy, don't that prove it?!

PT Barnum, unarmed, without a net, and alone in a fight to the finish struggle with destiny! - Bailey is the name, Mr. Barnum, and I'm here for my 3:30 appointment. - Well Mr. Bailey, I've given the matter a great deal of thought, sir. I'm afraid the answer is no. - But I sent you the plans and the photographs last week. Didn't you get a chance to look at them? - I saw the pictures, yes, and your manajerie looks very good. But I've been out of the exhibition business for years now, sir. I've been doing lecture tours. Course if you wouldn't mind a little advice. - No, I would welcome it. - Well you've gotta hook your attractions to the mood of the nation, sir. Now it's 1880, right? And with Grant in the White House, we're widening our horizons, broadening our outlooks. See your circus looks good, but it's too small. You need, well what, 10 elephants! 20 clowns, acrobats, bareback riders, fat ladies, a whole family of jugglers, six up on the highwire! - Impossible, you can't get all those acts into one ring. - Then you put two more rings on either side! You have a band of 40 pieces, whole separate tent for sideshows! Not to mention grandstands that you can put up and take down to seat 5,000 people!
