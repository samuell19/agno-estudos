NETFLIX PRESENTS Get in, Ana. Yellow, black. Yellow. Yellow, black. Yellow… Yellow. Black, yellow. Red. Yellow. Black. Yellow. Red. Don't move. It's poisonous. Hey, Pelusa! Come here! Get out of there. Mom, did my dad call? No. We'll see if he decides to send any money. …I love you. The thing is it's still not ready… I haven't been able to. Is everything okay? Ask him to call you back so we don't run out of credit. No answer. We'll call back tomorrow. Ana, go back to the house. I'll be there shortly. Yes. Hello? Yes, I got the money and everything. I got the money you sent me. Move just a bit. Can you hear me now? How's the baby, my child? Hello? Who does it look like? That's great. -Check again. -I'll call you back… Not fair, you're cheating. Let me go! You've ruined my shirt, you moron! You were asking for it, Margarito! Cover me. Move. -You move. -Move. -No. -The nerve. You're not playing. Margarito! Move! That milk is freezing. My Mom's going to scold me. Oh, Lord! Let me go! I'll have to go get some more, you idiot! Juana! Juana! Go home, Ana. It really is a shame. I'm afraid they're creating this big vacuum by not declaring if, indeed, they are from the police. We are not 100% positive they are, because besides being corrupt, they would be… Ma? Go to sleep already, Ana. …it is enough… I wholeheartedly wish it wasn't Federal Police, because… It was a pigeon, semicolon That lost its nest, stop and next Lost it in the vine, start a new line Quiet! The scorpion has a stinger to defend itself from its enemies. -Ready, Josefina? -Yes. Let's listen to your classmate. My lecture is about living and non-living beings. The living beings can walk, breathe and communicate among themselves. For example, the cows with other cows. The dogs with other dogs. The cats with other cats. Each with their own community. The living beings are born of another being and die when they get old, just like us. Why did you include the rocks? Because the rocks are also living beings. Let's see. The rocks are not living beings because they don't have eyes, nor ears, nor blood. Don't look them in the eyes. Why? Open your mouth like this. Now twist it a bit. Okay. Your little mouth must be stretched out and twisted, like this. Hold it like that. This one's not working. Where's the other piece of beet? Here it is. Maria, do you want me to do your makeup? Yes. My mom and my dad gave each other tongue kisses. Yuck. It's freezing. Hang on, here. -You got me wet. -So? Little girl. What an awful boy. -Give me that. -Here. So you stop being dumb. Have them park on that side as they come in. -There's no more room there. -Then park them over here. How much ammo is missing? We have everything, sir. MUNICIPAL ASSISTANTSHIP SAN MIGUEL, JALISCO -An early start. -We should look for a better spot. The commander said you'd get the report from the corporal. -I didn't receive a thing. -I'll stay on guard duty. SALON What's up? You didn't go to work? I did, but I left early. Why are they here again? The harvest starts tomorrow. They brought the helicopter and the whole circus. They've already started spraying poison near the fields, by the school. That's what they get paid for, to spread it everywhere they shouldn't. Will you go to the poppy fields? How much are you getting this time? About 300 per day, depending on how much you can harvest. Believe it or not, this one's pretty fast milking buds. I can get you in if you want. It's better than cleaning other people's houses. No, thanks. -Can I bring over Ana tomorrow? -Sure. I don't want her alone in the house. Yes, there's no rush. They raided a house yesterday. They took a girl. Which house? Mr. Pancho's home. They took Juana? Yes. Help me with the beans, Ana. No, it's fine. Why are you wearing lipstick? I've told you you're not allowed. Next time, I'll knock your teeth out. I don't like you taking my stuff. Go on, wash your face. I didn't take your makeup. They didn't even take appointments. I had to go to San Miguel the other day for a prescription I used to get here. The outsiders get blackmailed. It's better if they leave. They harassed us into opening the clinic. What for? Mom… Enough, Ana. I told you, you'll get better. You've got so much hair, lice build nests up there. They cut my hair too when I was little. My mom used to apply a poison which really burned my scalp. Let's go. Hurry. Thanks, Helena. You're welcome, Luz. Goodbye, Maria. Besides, the school warned us that anyone with lice or live nit won't be allowed in the classroom. It'll make it easier to brush them off, right, Helena? Hair grows back, child. The doctor was already scared, Rita. His number was up. Will you close? No. They don't bother me. I pay to stay here, I'm under protection. I don't want to! Why didn't they cut Maria's? Because they have bitter blood, Paula. And lice don't like that. Ana and I always get lice. Right, Ana? Juana! Brand new, 100% crocodile skin. -Ready? -Yes. Go get a glass. They're cool. Where did you buy them? They are made right here. Hey, dude, why don't you go gather the people for the poppy? We have 40 day laborers, that should do it, right? -We'll see. -Sure. We better get busy. I know you're there. You will die. I know you're there. You'll die. I'll go join my mom. Ma… What are you doing here? I asked you to stay home, Paula. Yeah, but we were playing with Maria and we heard that they'll be spraying poison. You told me it's better to come to the fields when the choppers are here, Mom. And you didn't leave any food. …in a little while we'll lie down on the little rocks we saw the other day. -Those little rocks… -Okay, fine. Wait for me up there. Here, take my water. Hopefully it won't be too hot. Last time, the heat was tough, I could barely stand it. Good afternoon. Good afternoon! Thanks for coming. I asked you to come because we're about to end the school year. And some kids in second level still haven't brought their contribution. -Excuse me. -Bring it by Monday, please. -A committee of moms sees to the payments. -Come out here, we're playing fetch. We're going to need more support from you. I want to take the opportunity, since we're all here, to touch on a delicate subject. We all know it's been a hard year. And many families had to abandon the town. I've been asking around, and no one's talking. That girl that was taken, Juana, is also my student. You are my students' moms. And I would like you to tell me what you know about what happened. There's a shelter here in San Jose where they welcome displaced families from the sierras. I'll be teaching out there next year. So, you'll close the school again? I'll complete this school year. But no teacher wants to come here anymore. To any of the towns. These people are demanding money to let us work. And we've all agreed that we won't pay them. Me. And me. And me. Hey, what do you think will happen to us when one of us three suddenly leaves? Quiet, Ana, I can't hear. It's a cow. Can you hear it? They are Mr. Pancho's cows. They're loose. That cow is in the mango's meadow. I'll ask you something if you promise not to get upset. Yes. Why wouldn't you tell the teacher? What the teacher said was wrong. Why? We don't know him. He's not from here. Is it true that they killed Mr. Pancho? No. They took him away. Now the cows have no master. They took Juana too? She went to live somewhere else with her mom and her little sister. Why did they leave everything behind, then? That's how it's done, Ana. People leave everything as if they will come back one day. How do you know? Enough, it's your turn. Close your eyes. I don't hear any cars or trucks. A cicada. No, a cricket. An owl. It's in the water hill. Whose dog is that? Ew! Move! Maria. Pass me the stick. Ew! It stinks. It's filthy. It will take us a year to clean this up. There was… There was a crazy woman. There was a horrible crazy woman. -There was a… -Here comes your brother, Maria. Where were you? You stink. None of your business. I'll tell Mom you didn't go to work. That's Juana's bike. Do you want to get on? -You stole it. -I didn't steal it. Give it back. …the dog… They are not coming back! Maria, go home! Focus, Paula. Close your eyes. You have to get inside her mind. Ana, enough. I'm thinking of a color. Purple? No. -Blue? -Yes, good. Now I'll call it. It's a number. -Ready? -Ready. You're both very good. You have to focus more. Now, flying animals. Eight. The Guerrero family. Six. The Diaz family. It's 12. Twelve? Okay. -Ma… -Let's go! It's late! It's close to school. Let me go! -We've got to call the police. -No. Why not? Pick him up. What if it's my teacher? Would you like it if it was you? Let's go! You know the drill. Answer, for fuck's sake. Quiet, Ana. Bring me another beer. I'm not bringing it. Go on. Come here. Come here, I said. Come sit with me. Are you scared of your own mom? No. I put up with a lot from your dad. That was my mistake. But he loves us a lot. He went away to work to send back money. That's why he won't answer. You better shut up, Ana. Whose are those? I don't know, I just got here. What about Maria? She stayed at home. I didn't see it, but my son did. They sprayed the whole hill with that poison. That's why some people were getting affected. The helicopter's been at it since early morning, back and forth. Everyone in town was up there. The helicopter was already there when I got to the mill. Ana! Ana, you can't go outside, okay? -What happened? -The doctors arrived. You didn't believe me when I told you. -Now I do. -How do you feel? Good. Meet me up there? What happened? They'll fix Maria's mouth. What? They'll do the surgery. Would you let me go? But go change first. Bring it this way. Over here. DOCTORS OPERATING ON CHILDREN -They have to wait. -We have to cover the clinic. It's all empty over there. …lots of devices. Part of the stuff they brought with them. -I'm late. Did they run out of tickets? -Yes, they just had a few. Been here since early morning. Do you see her? No. Jose Antonio Torres' mom? …he went to fight and… There you go, good. Come in. Go to the doctor's office at the very end. Maria Almudena Ramirez's mom? It's me, doctor. Okay, let's go. Go. They're seeing Maria. You can take a seat. Come on in. -Thanks, Doctor. -Yes. -Can we go in? -Are you related to Maria? -No. -Only family members are allowed. Ruben Orlando Garcia's mom. I think they will stay, at least until tomorrow. -You're here every day? -Yes. I could bring some tortillas, a bean taquito… -Beans. -…with some sauce. What about this one? Will you help me, child? I spilled it. The orange drink… You have to open it bit by bit. Break ranks! Take cover! Down, soldier! Get down, Ana! Go fuck yourselves! Leave it to me. They're gone. It's the new cartel. On your feet, soldier. Do you know which color? I'm going to the meetings. You should go too. Let's see. We'll set up a barricade at the town's entrance. Sol is organizing the committee. Sign up. I won't get involved in that. The people from Naranjo promised they would come help us, and San Jose too. If they could defeat those assholes, we can too. You're working in the fields? You should go. They protect the day laborers. We'll have a meeting with the folks from Naranjo. We've got nothing to lose now. Does it hurt? You'll look pretty. Here. We have the cornea… SENSES EAR, EYE, HAND …the iris and the lens. MY MOUNTAIN WORD PLAY This one is like a little lens that helps to focus on the objects. It's located right behind the pupil. This is the same as this. Now, each eye captures a different vision, slightly different, of each object. And that is why we see things as we do, in 3D. In different dimensions and depths. What would happen if we just had one eye? Imagine one eye right in the middle. We would see things much flatter. Like in a photograph. -I want to kiss him. -Now… I want you all to close one eye. Just one. There it is. Now, raise a finger, the index, right in front of you. Now align the finger, put it in front of a straight and thin object, like the frame of the blackboard. I'll use this window right here. And, without moving the finger, switch eyes. Open the closed one. Close the open one. Switch, change eyes. Switch eyes. Keep switching. Switch. Right? Did you see? It moves, right? Sometimes, our perception of what we see is not real. Because this eye… I'll become a teacher. Sometimes it's not enough to see with your eyes. Right? Is that clear? Let's see if it's true. I want someone to come up here… to sit in this chair. -Huh? -It's upside down, sir. Exactly. It's upside down. You can't use the chair for its intended use. But I don't care. I want someone to come up here and sit down. Good job, Paula. Many things in this town are upside down. Right? But Paula was brave enough to come up and change something. Thanks. Welcome, gentlemen, to this rodeo we have prepared for you tonight. Straight from the land of brave men and beautiful women, Los Altos de Jalisco. Tonight, we have the pleasure of introducing one of the rodeos that will make history in this land, ladies and gentlemen. This great bull will come into the arena. The Diamond, would you look at that. Maybe one of the wildest bulls in the Western world. We have our next rider for the evening, Margarito Villegas, Juli, who brought with him a beautiful bouquet of flowers: his sister Maria, who's here to lend her support. Straight from the San Miguel community, a warm welcome to you, beautiful people. Give it up for Margarito! You're so lucky, my friend! Look at the bull you got. He's been here for a while. Here he is, entrusting himself to the Almighty. Here's this kid to challenge him. There's so much tension, everyone's on edge. Lots of anticipation for this ride on one of the best animals in this herd. We'll see the door open as soon as he drops and gives the signal. -One of the best rides of the night. -Hang on, bull. -It seems everything's ready. -Hang on. Get the door, gentlemen! And here's the bull. Look at the bucking. He stays on! Let's see his moves! The bull is bucking. He's still with it! Look at the bucking! And this beast is making a statement, gentlemen! And he's letting go! Watch out! No way! Grab him! That's the move, my friends. Watch out! Careful, gentlemen! Watch it, or that bull will send you flying. Give it up, gentlemen! What a ride we just witnessed. -Would you look at that… -Bravo! …what he's done on this round! This rider gets an ovation, and he sets the audience on fire! -He's my brother. -What a great ride! Give it up for Margarito! A promising young rider! Welcome, everyone to this great gathering tonight! Come on! Do you want a drink? Here, drink up. Okay. Let's go dance. -No, I don't dance. -Come on. Come. Can you do it? Yes, you can. Let's see. The boy was a good dancer, huh? Did you see when Luz and Maria left? They didn't even say goodbye. Maria is still hurting from her scar. She used to have a gap right here. Since she was born. I know that. There must be a dead animal. There's something there. Wait here, Ana. Fucking hell, don't look at her! Who is it, Mom? Walk. They left her there. Whose girl was it? I don't know. That girl's not from here. They left a message. It was hanging from a hook in her chest. Good thing you didn't touch it. It's better if they think no one's read it. That's what you think. They know we got the message. I don't have a dime. I don't have anywhere to go. Besides, you know he hasn't sent any money in two years. You look good. Don't snitch on me with Mom, okay? What's up? Here's the delivery. It's really cold, right? A little. Alright, my friend. Okay, you can go. Thanks, copper. Do you know these people? No, they're not from here. You reek of alcohol. Liar. Yes, you've already told me that, Jesus. More so here. I told you what happened. I don't care how, but you have to send for her. Besides, she can work now. Jesus? Hello? Ma? Look at me, Mom. You don't want me living with you? You'll be better off there, Ana. I don't want to go live with him. If you work hard, you could make good money. What do I care? -You don't have a say. -Let go! You just want me hidden like a worm. Do you know why I hide you? Do you know what they do to girls? You've heard, right? Do you want it to happen to you? He won't send any money. Think of something else. Flying animals. I don't want to play. There's a scorpion. DAD We'll set it down here, underneath the water tank. They're making a sculpture. That's from a machine. It's to attract lightning, so when there's a storm, the lightning won't strike the houses, but the metal. Move. Mr. Leonardo is really strong. Where did they bring it from? I think they brought it from the mine. It's done. Mr. Leonardo's coming! Okay, quiet now. Did you take out everything you brought? -Yes! -Everything? Sure? -Yes! -Very well. Mister Leonardo, why did they put up the bell? Well, we put up the bell so those who live far away can listen when there's something important going on. And the people of San Jose will help look after the town. Okay, let's go on. "Spine." And… "sex." Now, I want you to gather your stuff and come sit on the floor. We won't use the desks. There's no rush, be careful. And we'll make a circle here, please. Here's good. Okay, listen, in this space each one of you will build a human body, with all the stuff you brought. Use everything you brought. -Should we do it? -Do it, yeah, a human body. I'll watch while you work. HEART, SPINE, SEX Okay, we'll leave it here. Stop now. Very good. Ana, you'll go first. Name all the body parts you've built, from head to toe. But describing each of the objects you brought. Don't stop, don't overthink it, just talk about your figure. And start with your name. Ana has… Ana has two eyes made of corn, one white, one blue. She has a bottle cap for a nose. No, quiet. Let's listen to Ana. Thanks. She has a red hair fastener for a mouth. She's got, for a backbone, a scorpion trapped inside a bottle. Her heart is made of… three rocks from the mountain. For hands… For hands… she's got wires. And her legs are made of corn husks. And I forgot to give her feet. Good job, Ana. Thanks for sharing your figure. Let's see, Osmar. Tell us. First to reach the shore wins. Or whoever stays up here the longest. -I call dibs on Mr. Leonardo. -Me too. Oh, me too. No, I called it first. I'm falling. It's so fucking cold! Your thing is falling off… Right, she likes them curly. Like sheep. I don't like Leonardo's hair. Enough, leave me alone. No wonder the water got warm. Don't be silly! Look at your hair, it looks like a hedgehog. -Almost. -I need more practice. It's only been two days. Do you want to try? -No, I don't like it. -Here, it's cool. -Okay. -Here. -Do you see that big lump? -Yes. First to knock the biggest one wins. Okay. You're good. I thought you didn't shoot. Now shoot that branch. Did you know they wrap the poppy resin inside lion's dung? So the dogs won't smell it at the airport. Where do they get the lions? These guys keep them captive. How do you know? What? Pull it. Come on! You coward. Who gave it to you? I found it. -Who gave it to you? -I found it, I said. You liar. Calm down. -Move. Let me go. -Stay still. -Enough. -I said no! Put me down. Hang on. Watch it. I don't want to fall. Kids, please go back to your places. No one leaves the classroom. Pour some more water. Pass me more water. It's coming off. Here! In my hand. Get it off. There. Get it off! Yes, take it easy. Easy. I can still taste it in my mouth. A metallic taste. Me too. Come here. I call it. Here we go. Easy, mild or hard? Hard. Ready? Ready. Focus. Ready? Ready. Come on, don't go. Come here. What is it? You have a stain on your pants. Don't worry, it's normal. I know that. Ana! I'm back! What happened? Ma, do you have any pads? What? Yeah, I couldn't find your Kotex. You got your period? Yes. Why do you get mad at me? I'm not mad, Ana. It's not fair, sir. You come up here saying you'll stay on the entire school year, and now you tell me you're leaving. You know that's not true, Rita. No one guarantees my safety working here. -Put yourself in my shoes. -No, put yourself in mine. Ana turned 13. She's in sixth grade elementary. At this pace, she'll never finish. Look, I brought Ana's report card. She already passed, even though we haven't finished, it says Ana has graduated from elementary school. Rita, Ana is a very good student. You need to keep supporting her so she can get ahead. -Thanks a lot, sir. -There's nothing to thank me for. And I have to go because I have to visit the other houses. Ana, won't you say goodbye? Come. May I give you a hug? Okay, take good care of yourselves, Rita. -What time do you leave tomorrow? -I take off early. Why don't you come over for dinner? So we can all bid you farewell. Good thing there'll be no classes. I will really miss him. I like the way he taught. Mariana failed the class. See? I told you. I've won the bet. -I won't give you a thing. -Okay, carry it, then. -Why me? -Carry it. It's your turn. For being a sore loser. I thought I would fail, but I passed in the report card. Pay your bet, you cheater. Move. You move, moron. Fucking Margarito. Fucking copper. -How are you? -Good. -We're having some beers. Want one? -Not now. -When did you get here? -It's been a while. Take it easy. Come here. Easy. Stay still. Easy, cutie. Hang it. Hurry, Ma! Ana, go hide! Good afternoon. Good afternoon, sir. We've come for the girl, Mom. There's no girl here. Don't try to trick me or there will be hell to pay. I only have a boy, sir. He's up the mountain chopping wood right now. And the machete, why did you bring it out? How old is your daughter? I swear, I only have a boy. Who else lives in the house? Just me and my son. My husband works on the other side. What will it be, Mom? You better hand her over the easy way. We'll find her no matter what. There's no one here, sir. Do I fuck her up? I work in the poppy field. Scratching. Ana. No, don't come out. Stay. Stay right there. Stay. I'm scared they might return. Ana, I've asked you to stay right there. -Let me go! -Ana! Ana! Get down. Ana, please. Mom. We have to leave. Help me put the stuff away. Load it up. We need to extend it, cover the gaps. They put a gun to my head. Let's go! The dogs didn't bark, Concha. Maria! Maria. They took my daughter. Subtitles: José Luis Albertini
