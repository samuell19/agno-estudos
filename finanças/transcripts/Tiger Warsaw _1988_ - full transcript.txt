(somber music) (bell dinging) - I thought if I'm gonna get a new dress for my daughter's wedding, I'd like it to be something really special. Not Chiquita bananas special like her sister in law Barbara but something really nice. I saw something at McGurdy's the other day when I was having lunch with Lucille. Tuesday. Was it Tuesday? We had shrimp salad. 10 or so colors. Lovely, lovely pink colors. Almost orange. You don't really give a damn, do you Mitchell? - You can buy anything you shall choose, yellow, purple, red if you like. When you're happy, I'm happy. - Gene and Barbara are arriving a week from Sunday. If she can tear him away from the boxing match. Paula's getting married. Roger's a caring man, pretty bright, centered. - You like everybody centered, huh? Where did you pick that up? - I used to be afraid for her. (revving) But I'm not anymore. Oh I don't care how successful she is. How many land development deals she makes. Chamber of Commerce Awards, how near, how many scarves she owns. It doesn't really mean anything unless you have someone. 'Cause we hope. - That's what weddings are all about. - Hope? - Yup. And orange dresses. (light music) - Oh don't. - Come on, let's go. (woman giggling) (siren sounding in background) (tense music) (thunder clapping) - Crazy animal! - Dad! (gunshot ringing) (sighing) (sighing) (honking) (sighing) - Dream away, child. - Hi. - Sorry I'm late. I was at the doctor's. He says A and B are doing just fine. - Oh good. - Come on. What's the matter? - I don't know. (mumbling) Maybe I'll keep my maiden name. I don't want it to fall off the face of the earth. Well maybe one of those hyphenated dealies. (laughing) (chimes ringing) (groaning) (somber music) (sighing) (knocking) - Nothing earth shattering. Although the McDermott fellow from Butler seems a little confused about the Farrell land division deal. He seems conveniently vague on some of the details you were very clear about. Never trust a redhead. Well it's nothing serious but I think you ought to look at it. Oh, Dick Huntington called. Isn't he a doll? Those teeth. And Stern Mortgage. Arnie Walsh is interested in the south flats deal, again. - Jet. - What? - Jet, it's Polish. It means phony baloney. Call Dick Huntington, set up something with him tomorrow at Villa Arena. You may go. Oh. (humming) Oh, Paula stop it, you stupid. (horn blowing) - You know I hate that shit, but you gotta buy it anyway. It's complete, total shit. - [Man Behind Counter] I wouldn't say that exactly. - You're a total fucking shit. - Yeah? Well, I may be total fucking shit. But I'm expensive total fucking shit. You are cheap total fucking shit. - You know my father's the first vice president. That key bank, he owns that, first! - Even bankers makes mistakes. - [Short Man] It doesn't matter what you like. Eat glass. - A much more picturesque speech, gentlemen. (guitar strumming) ♪ How things used to be ♪ How things used to be (sighing) - Been a long time. - Where did you come from? - Miami. All. Um, listen. You wanna go have a drink or something? - Yeah, okay. Hey Bill! I'm going out for a minute here. - [Bill] Okay, Tony. - This yours? - That's right. Come on. Well last thing I heard you were dealing out of Bolivia, Morocco or, - Dealing out of Morocco, that's very cool. It was seven years ago, man. It was Miami. Bad part of Miami. Shit, all of Miami is the bad part of Miami. Where you going? - I was just. - Oh. Uh, diet Coke, that's all I drink now, just diet Coke. - Diet Coke. - Thanks. (sighing) You know I flew out of town as, high as a kite and I didn't stop until I hit bottom. - And my wife's expecting a baby. I married Valerie Solaris, man. We're expecting twins. I hope one of them is gonna be a boy. Little Tony. - Little Tony. He'd hate you for it. - Yeah, so what else is new since the beginning of time? - What's up? - Ah! - Oh man, I'm sorry. - I got it, it's okay. I got it, it's all right. I got it. - Fuck, let's get out of here. - So what you come back for, your sister's wedding?- - What, wedding? You mean again? I don't understand. Is she and Dave divorced? - She never married Dave. You didn't know that? - No. What happened? - You, Chuck. - Oh God! (tense music) - Tony. Man. I'm sorry, I really am sorry for everything that I did. - Wait. Come on, you okay? Come on Chuck, hold it. Come on, wait up. - Tony look, I gotta know, man. You gotta tell me. I drove by the house yesterday and I saw my mama in the window and my dad's car was in the driveway in the daytime, and... - He's okay. - Oh thank god he's all right. Oh thank god. Man, all of a sudden, I thought maybe I killed him or something. - All right? That depends on what you mean by all right. - Well he's alive, at least I got a scrap of hope. - Oh man, you don't exist for them anymore. - Hey I said, just a scrap, man. Tony, Tony, look, man. I got nothing to live for, man. I mean, I got nothing except a lot of pain I've caused. I mean is it true, is it really true? That you can't ever go home again? - Oh no, oh no. God damn it. You lied to me, you stole. You ruined everything and then you left! I got my own family to think about, god damn it! What the fuck do you want out of me? - [Chuck] Tony. (bell dinging) (tires screeching) (train horn blaring) (tense music) (chugging) (screaming) (gunshot ringing) (banging) (bell dinging) (honking) - Okay asshole, let's see some ID. - I'm sorry. - Come on, come on. This your present address? - Yes sir. (car honking) - Robin, Emily, you sit still, I'll be right back. - This thing is the vagabond. - Is there a problem here? Hey, I know you. - You know this guy? - Karen. (cars honking) Kiki! - Kiki? Kiki, no shit! - No shit. - Get out of here. - Hey, I'm listed under McGregor in Farrell. Call me, okay? Look, I got kids, six and eight. - Great. - Are you here for the reunion? - No. I didn't know. - [Man] Come on, move it, buddy. - Oh, knock it off. - [Cop] Lose it. - Yes sir. - [Man] Hey you go on get moving. - [Man] Move it! (car starting) (light music) - [Val] Now both shoulders together. Okay, that's it. Good night ladies, thank you. - Rar! Hi Val. Oh what, Tony and Amy. No, no, no. Tony and Tammy? Tammy and Amy? How about Lisa and Tony? Oh, no, no, Tony and Ted. (chuckling) I saw Chuck Warsaw today. (somber music) - Tony. I don't want you to see him again. Please. - Okay. - Hey Tiger. Remember me, Homerwood High School? (laughing) It might have been gym class. I'm a little different now. (laughing) - Okay. (sighing) (rain pattering) - So, Louise tells the kids and the maid that she is-- - Bunny was in his office. - Going to Saks Fifth Avenue. A trip from which she never returned. Bunny was worried, he called the cops. She disappeared off of god's earth, poof. He spent thousands trying to find her. - And a Chicago matron in a playground was sure that she'd seen someone fitting the description picking out bottles out of the garbage, a bag lady. But they couldn't find her. Poor man. - Then he met Monique. A ravishing beauty. All this time Bunny kept the summer house at the shore because he said he couldn't bear to go there because it reminded him of Louise. - Thelma, I think you ought to finish the story after dinner. - A young couple bought the house and they decided to put a rec room in the basement. Imagine their surprise when they started digging and found bones. - Mom, you never told us. - No, but we're eating. - Had Bunny murdered Louise? It crossed everybody's mind. - I don't think Roger's interested in this. - Yes he is. Now look at the situation. Bunny was a father of three little kids. Can you imagine the suffering he'd go through if he'd been arrested? What would you have done? - Oh that's difficult. Well I'd like to think I'd see justice done. - [Thelma] You are marrying quality. (laughing) - Well he called the police the next morning. The bones, my dear were those of a Great Dane. - Oh, I should have known. - Doesn't mean he didn't kill her. Monique was some dish. - So the skeleton in this family's closet is the dog's. - You read too much Agatha Christie, Aunt Thelma. (phone ringing) Louise simply gave up and walked out of her life. - No you don't just walk out. I don't care how much reason you have. You don't just walk. - [Thelma] He's so damn judgemental. - Hello? Val, hi. This is Paula. Are you all right? Are you in labor? Oh. What? Oh. Don't tell anyone else, okay? I'll take care of it myself. (rain pattering) (light music) (thunder rumbling) - Tiger. Oh. Chuckie. - I've got a beard. (laughing) - How are you? - You look terrific. - No I don't. - Mom. - No, no, he mustn't see you. Oh please, what do you need? - [Mitchell] Frances? I can't find the envelope. - Yes darling, I'll be right there. - Can I come back another time? - Not now. Go, please. Go now. Go. (somber music) (rain pattering) - Nothing ever changes around here. And I hate Thelma. - She means well. - She means well. Means well, everybody means well. It's not what people mean, Paula, it's what they do. - Louise is probably very happy getting old at Saks Fifth Avenue. - Louise is dead. Bunny killed her. - Dad. - Well he never would have killed her if she hadn't run out. He spent a lot of time and money trying to find her. And one day he found her. She was in Chicago, she was picking up empty bottles for two cent deposit in Lincoln Park. She was drunk, dirty. He was revolted by what he saw. He knew he could never have her back again, at least not the way she was. So he killed her. - Dad? I don't know if you're teasing me or not. This is getting me very upset. - I made it up. - The thing is, I don't have anything in common with him anymore. Oh I don't know, maybe we should invite him. I'm his very type, and that was a long time ago. We had long hair, we wore bell bottoms and lots of fringe. Wanted to be Sonny and Cher, I think they still do. They won't come anyway, but. - What's wrong with you, Paula? - Nothing, why? - Something is bothering you. You know you're not as tough as you'd like this world to believe. Will you tell me, please? - I'm fine. Fine. I am so glad I have you. I love you. Now come inside. (light music) - Yes. Do you have a name and address for a Karen McGregor in Farrell? Yes, thank you. Well. Lots of flowers. - Yeah, I bought a franchise. A dozen roses and a gold box sort of place. It's almost paid off too. - I see. - Sit down. - So, uh... - What time is it, mommy? - It's late, honey. This is Emily. - [Chuck] Hi, Emily. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - [Karen] Okay. - Uh, look. Maybe I better go. - No, it's fine. I'm just gonna put her to bed, okay? Whoah! Ooh. - Who's that? - He's just an old friend. - He looks like Abraham Lincoln. - That's just because of his beard, honey. (chuckling) Mommy loves you. - [Emily] How much? - This much. Night hon. - [Emily] Night. - [Mitchell] Frances. What are you doing? - Nothing. - [Mitchell] Come to bed. - In a minute. - [Mitchell] Now. ♪ I'm still waiting for you ♪ I'm still waiting here for you ♪ - Sorry. And you know who you let in? - Just your average neighborhood lunatic. - You look, your hair is long, you're skinny, well I don't mean you're skinny, but, - Will you sit down, relax? Do you want a drink or something? - No, I don't drink anymore. - How about? Do you want some? - No. - You always were in overdrive. Downshift. - Downshift? I remember. We were wasted that night. You were wasted that night. We were downtown and you got that tattoo. Do you still have it? - What do you think? You were all over me that night. I had to run away from you. - Yeah you ran. I chased you two solid years but you were always with those short-haired jocks. - I had some kind of wicked power over them, didn't I? For a while there, it was like I was doing community service. I got married to a lawyer, you know. You don't wanna hear this, do you? You know, you scare me. You've always scared me. Truth is, you were the only one I really cared about. - Oh well one never knew. - Forget it, you wouldn't have known what to do with it if you had a chance. - Yeah. And you sure never gave me a chance. - Look, I invited you here. I know it sounds crazy. I didn't want to wait another 15 years of wondering. - It's been, I feel like an old man now, I don't know if. - My fun loving, care free boy. I know who you are. The bad seed. (giggling) (light music) (cat mewing in distance) - [Mitchell] You know? I'm afraid of the dark. - Oh. (huffing) (chuckling) That was intense. - [Karen] Yeah me too. - You're beautiful. - [Karen] I am? Thanks. (sighing) Mmm. (train honking in distance) - Look, um, maybe I ought to go, you know. It's late. - [Karen] Will you shut up and just come back to bed? - You know all the time that I was getting better at the rehab clinic, it's like I had this longing. It's like you dive into one end of the pool when you're 18, and then when you reach the other side, you're like over 30. Oh yeah, your kids, that's great. That is really great, Karen. - Yeah, it is. You know, my ex-husband hasn't seen them in two years. It's his loss, the bastard. - I have a son. - You do? - Harris Mitchell Warsaw. - Oh, that's nice. - His mother was a cocktail waitress in Tampa. Heavy, heavy into drugs. She gets straight just long enough to make sure he got fed and I guess felt loved. - That's a lot actually. - Anyway, they went to St. Louis. She met a guy, (mumbling) - She met a guy, and? - I signed him away, Karen. - What do you mean, you? - My son. I was blasted out of my mind when I put my signature on the paper to let her husband legally adopt him. - Oh Christ! - I haven't seen him for four and a half years. I don't even know what they call him. - Oh, oh Chuck, that's awful! Awful, if anybody ever took my, oh, for a second. - I just couldn't be bothered. It was like I was longing for someplace I'd never been. I didn't know where, but, then one day I'm like flipping the channels and there's a game on. And I'm sitting in Miami fucking rooting for Pittsburgh. - They need all the help they can get. - It was a, a longing for home. So last week I jumped in the car, headed north like a bird in spring. - I think you're great just for getting in the car. Now will you get in this goddamn bed? I got kids to look after in the morning, okay? (chuckling) Hold me. That's it. (chuckling) (train horn sounding in distance) (birds chirping) - [Reporter] Good morning, I'm Billy Rowe, this is Dylan Archer-- - Oh, meet Domingo, the greatest monster from outer space, ready to eat up my friend, my hands and all my friends. Domingo is smart. Domingo is king of outer space. - Pass the butter. - But Domingo is king of outer space. - Who is Domingo? - Domingo is a friend of his who moved to Toronto. Had quite an effect on him. But why he's calling a monster after a friend I have no idea. - Oh, Robin. Domingo is not quite conscious yet. Could you please cut him some slack? - Domingo begs for mercy. - Domingo sits down, right now. - [Reporter] Connecticut's State of Haletport has held up the convention of a Fairfield woman who hired Tickles the clown. (somber music) - [Paula] Did you know? - [Frances] Know what? - I thought so. I won't have you seeing him. He's dead. We agreed. Does daddy know he's back? - No. - It'd kill daddy if he knew. Mom! You will not see him. - I was unaware that you've been granted the divine right to give me orders. Do you really think I would do anything to hurt your father? We saw each other for, five seconds and exchanged two words. I'll probably never see him again. (somber music) (phone ringing) (knocking) - Lieutenant Fontana? - Yes. Have a seat. Beautiful day. You can actual breathe real air on that shit. And people will get into trouble. Yeah what we need is a snowstorm. You know what happened to the crime rate when it snows? It plummets. The sunshine's no good. In fact, the nicer the day is, the happier they get, the drunker they get. The next thing you know, they're beating up on somebody. That's why there's no crime in Russia. They're not happy. - Can I ask you a question? - Oh sure. Look, you got a problem, you can confide in me. I just hope it's not weird. - It's weird. I am, I caused a lot of property damage to my parent's home. - Uh, what's your name? - Why? - So I can put it in the computer. What's your name? - Chuck Warsaw. - Was anybody hurt? - My father was, but he's all right now. - What's the address? - 485 Columbus. - Lucille, yeah. Get a patrol car over to 485-- - Oh no, that's not necessary. - Why not? - It happened in 1971. - [Fontana] Ah, no, Lucille, I'm sorry. No, forget that. Why did you come here today? - I'm not trying to pretend that it didn't happen or that I'm not responsible. I just want that on the record, thank you. - Sit down. - Why? - Sit down and I'll tell you. - What is it? - A restraining order was filed this morning forbidding you to be within 200 yards of Mitchell Warsaw. - Who did that? - Seems your father's mentally incompetent so your sister took care of this for him. If they don't want to talk to you, you can't make them. You can't even try to make them. - Thank you. - Have a nice day. (zooming) - Who's driving today? - Oh, Carl, thank you. Stan went to pick up his grandchildren but he's gonna meet us later on over at the arena. - Yeah, Mitchell Warsaw. I love you very much. - Would you still love me if my name was Mitchell Zelinkanikowic? - Oh, I know. Your daddy came from Poland via Warsaw. - The authorities at Ellis Island saw his namecard, saw something like Zelinkanikowic via Warsaw. - And it was easier to say Warsaw than Zelinkanikowic. - Then it stuck. (car honking) Okay Carl, I'm coming. What's your hurry? (light music) (sighing) (phone whirring) - [Kids] Please leave your name and telephone number after the beep. Thank you for calling. (giggling) - Karen. I just don't belong here. So you take care of yourself. Bye. (zooming) (revving) - [Robin] Domingo begs for mercy! - [Karen] Karen, Kiki! (voices echoing over each other) (somber music) - I just don't wanna see you hurt anymore. - Do you think he came back for your wedding? (revving) - [Karen] I don't wanna wait another 15 years. You were the only one that I ever cared about. (tires screeching) (revving) (light music) (doorbell ringing) (knocking) - Coming. Hold your horses. - Hi. - Hi. Planning another trip? - I was. But I realized that, I need to be here. (light piano music) - Thank you. So did you get them from my shop? - [Chuck] Yeah. - [Karen] Hey look who's here. - Yay, yay, Domingo! - [Karen] Um, there's still some dinner if you wanna eat. - [Chuck] Um, okay. Just a minute though, I got. - [Robin] Poo poo. - [Karen] Oh, pssh. (light music) Close your eyes. - What? - Close your eyes! - What are you doing there? - Trust me. - I heard that. Have you ever done this before? - No, I've never done this before but there's a first time for everything. - Oh, you cut me, sweetheart, and you're dead meat. - Don't move! Here you go. (light piano music) (laughing) Hey, no! - I like that. (bell tolling) (bag rustling) - I have a recipe for banana custard pie that Edith Kadomsky gave me. She always changes something so that it doesn't turn out quite the same. Honey? You think it's the butter in this one? I'll use twice the butter, I think. (car starting) (train horn sounding) - [Chuck] Hey, Franco! It's Tiger. - Yeah, I see that. - So what do you think? Wanna do a little one on one? Okay? - Yeah. - Let's walk. Junior Varsity Championship, Pittsburgh Civic Arena, May 24th to the 26th. What a weekend. - Yeah I remember. I remember. Tie score, 105-105. - I moved down, I go up. I pass you the ball. I move down, you pass it back. - Five seconds left. - You pass it, go up, scores. Well almost scores. He scores. We win, and we won. - We won. I gotta get home to Valerie. - Yeah, I know. I mean dadhood, you gotta get home to your better half. - Yeah. Look, do you need a few bucks or something man? - No, no. I'm looking for a job. I'm sure there's something I'm unqualified enough to land. - Well I just laid a guy off. - Forget it. I'm fine. Just seeing you like this, man, just gives me all the hope. Tony, I really love you, man. - Yeah, I gotta go. - [Chuck] I'll see you. (somber piano music) (sighing) - What place is this? - Hi. - Hi, how are you? - [Woman] Now this cake here, the Continental, will serve 200 people. Another favorite here, roses entwined with blown sugar lovebird. - [Both] Blown sugar lovebirds. - [Karen] Darling! - I am now earning slightly over 165 dollars a week and I have never been happier in my life. - I'm on to show. - The white elephant overlooking Buhl Park, I know. Miss Warsaw's office. Paula, it's-- - I'm late. - This guy wants to know where Paula's gonna be this afternoon. Should I tell him? He's got a fabulous voice. Miss Warsaw won't be in but she'll be showing the Buhl Mansion later this afternoon. Oh you're very welcome. (regal music) - [Woman] This is bronze. The work on the doors. - [Woman] This mirror is really bright. - It's bronze. - It is bronze. - [Woman] It looks so. - Oh you know what dear, this fireplace will be wonderful in the winter. - Oh yes. (light music) - It was made in Austria in the 1870s when they were at the height of crystal production. - It's very beautiful, Patricia, but I want you to wander through the house one more time, I want you to be sure. - All right. - Enjoy. - I think she likes it. - I do too. - It really is very beautiful. - [Chuck] Excuse me. - Oh, you startled me. - I'm sorry. Do you know Paula Warsaw? - Yes, I do. - Would you mind getting her for me? - Uh, romance? - No, love. Thanks. (sighing) - [Woman] Paula? - Yes? - Paula, there's a very handsome young man downstairs who insists on speaking only to you. - Oh my goodness. - So we'll wait for you here, okay? - I'm sorry, excuse me. - It's all right, it's okay. - Thank you very much. Well, what do you think? (light music) - We used to do this when we were kids, remember? I'd catch your eye, you'd catch mine and we'd play the staredown game. - You're trespassing. - My eyes would be burning and tearing, and, but neither of us would give up. Your office told me you were up here. - Oh? At 5:30 I'd be showing a house at 3rd and Hazen and if you show up there I won't talk to you either. In fact, I'll have you arrested. - I didn't think you would see me any other way. - I will call the police. - You have a lot of connections up there, I gather. - Get out of here. Go back to where you came from. - That's what I'm trying to do, Paula. (somber music) I never meant to hurt you. - This street? - Or anyone else. So uh, I uh, I hear Roger's very good looking. - Don't do that! - How else am I gonna get to know you again? - You won't, ever. - I'm not going to hurt you. You think that you can ever forget me, huh? What, like rip me out of your mind? - Yes. (laughing) - Try. Just try. And that is what I must have looked like that day. (sobbing) (clanking) - Oh.

I don't have anything to wear anyway. - (laughing) What do you mean you have nothing to wear? I wanna show you off to all these people. - I don't wanna see all those people. Everybody who went to that goddamn high school will be there. I spent my whole life trying to get away from them and their lousy fucking opinions. I ain't going.

Virtues of honest and generosity. - Sorry. - People's lives are made up of errands. Chores done. Chores to be done. And my sin is forbidding somebody to love you. - Mom? - Oh, oh! Oh, god. - [Chuck] (sobbing) I'm sorry, ma. - Oh! - I haven't been in this house for 15 years. Last time I was here I was trying to rip you guys off and he caught me.

What's the story on him anyway? - [Man] Ah, 12 or 15 years ago. He was an addict. Trashed the parents' house, beat his old man, shot him too, and split. Nobody knew he was back in town. - Hey mac, you're holding up the line. - What was his name? Um, Warsaw. (crowd applauding) (festive music in background) (light lounge music) - (gasping) Honey sweetikins! Oh! - How you baby? - Oh let me in there, let me in there. Hello. - Hi baby. - You look gorgeous. - I love the outfit, Aunt Barbara. Great hair. - You like it? Uncle Gene calls it the pineapple. - Been talking to your young man here. I like him. I like him a lot. Nothing but the best for my girl. - I see you've already met the crazy half of the family. - [Gene] Well, thanks a lot. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. - Well let's have a drink. - [Roger] Good idea. - Gene. Barbara. Mitchell. Paula. Roger. Me. - Why don't we just have a little friendly talk with the guy, you know what I'm saying? - No, no, uncle Gene. Roger and I will take care of this. - Honey sweetikins, I think we should call the police. - No, I don't want any more trouble. - You're my best girl, you always have been and I don't want you upset by anything. - I just wish that he would disappear. - Paula, we'll figure this out. - I got an idea. Come on, let's go. - Hey, look, maybe we could give him some money or something. - Uncle Gene knows what he's doing, let's go, come on. (light music) - Get me to a sporting goods store. - Eugene Warsaw, please. Warsaw like in the city. No answer, all right thank you. (cashiers beeping) (ominous music) Is this the Golden Dawn Supermarket? - Go to 485 Columbia Street. - You want me to take you there? - Why do you think I told you where I live? - Don't get excited, I'm not so bright. - Warsaw, Warsaw, your mom just called. It's an emergency. She wants you home right away. Go, go! (tense music) (rock music) ♪ You got the feeling on the road ♪ - What are we doing here, Gene? Let me see if I can get a hold of him. - You guys wanna make some money? Is that your car? I don't want you to hurt him. I just want you to scare him. - What's he doing, I don't like this. - Don't worry sweetiekins. Uncle Gene is just trying to make sure that Chuckie is not gonna hurt anyone around here anymore. - 20 bucks in it for you now and 20 bucks later. It's a deal? - No, no, no. This is getting way out of hand. - That's good, thanks. - Follow me. - [Roger] He's not at work. - Where is he? - He's on his way to your mom's. - Oh god, no, dad. Uncle Gene, go, go! (tense music) - [Chuck] Mom? - Oh, look. I want my family to be okay. Paula will be here any second and we'll have an hour to sort things out before your dad gets here. - You had me scared to death! - [Paula] Dad, no! Dad! (gunshot ringing) No! Dad. Look at me, look at me. Give me the gun. Give me the gun. - Oh, Mitchell. - You're not him. You're old, he's old. God, how I hated my son when he was my son. But you're not him. Frannie, Chuckie really died. And we never knew. Nobody ever told us. What a shame. What a shame. - Right. I don't belong here. - Come on. Knock it off. (car starting) - Oh great. I knew you'd be here. Jesus, still smells the same in here. Look, I stopped by the store to apologize for last night, you know. They told me about what happened at your folks' house. Shit, you okay? - What do you care? - Well I'm coming to you as a friend. (laughing) - Man, that ended 15 years ago. - Can't we try it again? - No. - Mom, you all right? - [Frances] I'm fine. - Fine? - [Frances] For 15 years I didn't know if my son was okay. He's okay. - They've been hurt more than I have, Karen. I just gotta be right with myself or I won't be good for anyone. - You're all right for me. - I just gotta see my kid. I don't know why, I just. Unfinished business, I guess. - This is finished business? Every 15 years or so, huh? The kids'll miss you. - I'll miss them. So I will call you when I get to St. Louis. (zipping) I just gotta see my son, Karen. - I understand. - I love you. (sighing) See you. (somber music) (sobbing) - You all right? - I'm fine. You look so handsome, daddy. - [Mitchell] Thank you, my darling. - Here, I'll get the door. - Frances? - Dad? - I think I'll drive. - All right. - No, on second thought, go ahead. - Maybe a funeral could bring this family back together. (somber music) - Look, I just thought there was a chance that he'd still be here. - No, he's at the Cardinal Bargain Rest Motel in St. Louis. He called, but he didn't say much. Hey, you two kids be quiet in there! - [Emily] Mom! - You okay? - You know Tony, it was real easy to love him again. Guess it just depends on what kind of memories you want to have with someone. I need all the good ones I can get. You guys all decided that he was rotten. You can live with it. - That's not fair. You just stop it, all right? Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I'm not the only one who was wrong here. But least I could hope for another chance, all right? Thanks. (clinking) - Uh oh. - [Man] There he goes. - Here we go. - Well, I'd like to make a toast. To my lovely Paula and to her lovely husband to be. May they be married for many, many years and have many, many wonderful children. - Oh, you hear. Now it's your turn, Roger. - Okay. Okay. (clearing throat) So uh, there I was, about to turn 40 and wondering why I hadn't ever met her. And along came Paula. Pretty soon after we started dating, in fact, real soon, she asked me why I hadn't been married. And that answer was very easy. I'd been waiting for her. - Oh, so sweet. (crowd applauding) - I love you, Paula. - Domingo. Domingo. (light music) - [Man] Come on son, time for bed, let's go. - [Woman] Okay Harry, go to bed. Time for bed. - [Man] Oh you're getting heavy. - Let's hear something from our brother in law, come on. Come on! - Just talk, just say any little thing. How about something from the mom? - [Barbara] Oh good. - Oh Chuckie. Tiger. To my son. So long, Chuckie. Thanks for going away. Now we can smile and nod and eat our dinner. For getting us messy and we have other plans. To Chuck Warsaw. We don't need you. We've done a good job of dealing with our disappointment. Oh Mitchell. Why wait until the funerals to wish we'd done better for each other? Why be lonely a minute longer? - [Gene] Mitch, hold on. - Uncle Gene, let him go. - [Gene] Mitch. (tense music) (car starting) - [DJ] This is WAQC St. Louis continuing with Saturday night TV great once again starting Martin Balsam. - Is this Karen? Well I'm Mitchell Warsaw. You know who I am. Do you know where Chuckie is? - You holding? Your light. (whimsical music) - Do you mind if I get in? I have to get on this flight. To St. Louis. Is it boarding right now? - Yes it is. Down through gate number two. (phone whirring) (somber music) (phone ringing) - Hi I'm Emily. - Hi, I'm Robin. - [Kids] Sorry we can't come to the phone right now. - Fucking machine. Fucking machine. - [Kids] Thank you for calling. - Uh, Karen. (rustling) (siren sounding in background) (tense music) (gunshots ringing) Dammit! (knocking) - I uh, I traveled all night. Here. (sobbing) - I love you, daddy. - Can you ever forgive me?
