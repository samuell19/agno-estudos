- Trick or treat! - Happy Halloween! - We're almost there. - Rural america. What do you say, kids? - I can't believe it. I'm gone, like, two minutes from the city, and halley and Emily are already best friends. - Oh, honey, I'm sure they just miss you. - I still get to visit, right? - Absolutely. - Oliver, pretty cool, huh? - This place is great, isn't it? - Over there, there's the school. - Look at those trees. Gorgeous. - That's the school? - It's gonna be good here. Don't you guys think? Right, honey? - Awesome. - It's really quaint. - This is great. - Mm-hmm. - Look at that steak house. Oh, we got to go there. - Friday night dinner at the steak house. - Fantastic. - Okay, I'll take that. - There's my new office. - Why's it so quiet? - Well, kids, we talked about this. It's gonna be a little different than the city. It takes some getting used to, but it's... It's gonna be good here. Wow, look at that view. Oh, the trees are just gorgeous. I wonder why some leaves change color and others don't. - Leaves change color because the days get shorter, and there's not enough sunlight. And some trees have a different chemical makeup and don't require the same amount of chlorophyll. - I didn't know that. Next stop... Our new home. - There it is, kids. - Hey, dad, look it. Your car beat us here. - Yeah, well, hopefully the furniture will get here too. - Okay, so... Verdict? What do you think? - It's beautiful. - It's awesome! - Can we go in? - Sure. We're home. Mccaffreys are home. - Okay, here we go. - Whoa. - This is awesome. It's, like, out of an old movie or something. - Jenny... Jenny McCaffrey. - Cut it out. - Ooh. - Spooky too. - This is more work than I remember. - Hey, where'd that old mirror come from? - Oh, it was left by the old owners. - Yeah, we thought we'd keep it. - I assume you checked the chimney for bats. - Bats? - Yeah, in these old houses, that's how they usually get in. - Mom? - Oliver! - Yeah, I'll be in the car. - Jenny, there are no bats. We had the house checked out. It's... fine. - I promise you there's nothing in this house but the four of us. - You're such a dweeb. - At least I know how to spell "dweeb." - Come on, let's go look at bat rooms. Bedrooms. - Come on. - Come on. - Come on. - Well, this is it. Your rooms are on the right. Have a look. - Yeah, I don't think so. This can be your room. This'll do. - Thank god. She likes it. - Yeah. - Good light. Bright and cheery. A fine office. - Hello, new neighbor. - Hi. I like your hair. - Eloise Jarvis. - Oliver McCaffrey. - Pleased to meet you, Oliver. My house is right around back there, so makes us neighbors now. Hey, would you lift that one for me? Straw helps collect the heat during the day and keeps the moisture off at night. There you go. Spread that out. - Did you plant these? - Kind of planted themselves. - Hmm. Well, how did they get planted in the first place? - Well, clive Rutledge kept the garden out here for years. - Who's clive Rutledge? - You're living in his house. At least it used to be his. Here, take a load off, Oliver. Clive came to Emery falls to teach back in 1925. He moved into this house the very first week. Got married, raised his daughter. Lived here his whole life. He even died here. - Wow. - Mm. He quit putting in a garden after a while, but the pumpkins, they just keep coming back. - Well, why'd he stop planting a garden? - Nobody knows. You know, there are a lot of stories about clive Rutledge. Never sure which ones to believe. - How do you know all this stuff? I'm sort of Emery falls' town historian. Unofficially of course. - Ha, yeah. - This old pumpkin patch, this is part of the town's history, so, uh, I'm sort of the self-appointed pumpkin tender. Hope you and your folks don't mind. - Heck no. Tend away. - Oh, you know what? I got to get to work. Uh, nice chattin' with you, Oliver. I'm gonna leave my straw and my wheelbarrow over there, okay? - See you around. - That you will. - You want some help? - No, it's getting there. I remember. - Who's that? - That's Mr. Parker. - Are you working today? - I didn't think so. - Doug. Karen. - How you doing? - Moving truck drove right past the office window, I figured I'd come out and welcome my new editor to town. And his lovely family. - Very nice to see you again, Mr. Parker. - Yeah, just stack 'em like numbers. - Looks like you have another visitor. Yeah. - There they are! Hey, neighbors. - Lindsay, what a surprise. - Welcome to Emery falls. - They're still warm. - Just a little tradition I have for your first day in your new home. - Well, thank you very much. - I just knew this was gonna be a match made in heaven. I can always feel it when it's the right house for the right family. - Still don't know how you gave us such a great deal on this place. - Let's just say the previous owner was, um, motivated. - Apparently, Mr. Dexter got some job offer out of town. It must've been good, because he was packed and out of here in no time. - Guess it's all in the timing. - Speaking of which, you're obviously busy, so I'll get out of your hair. And I'll see you bright and early Monday morning at the herald? - Looking forward to it. - I'm gonna grab that sale sign. - Oh, let me help you. - Hey, guys! Guess what. There's no Internet. - Stay calm. She can smell fear. - Honey, looking for you. You okay? - Just got a little dust in my eye. - Oh. Okay. Wow. What's all this stuff? - Maybe Dexter forgot it. You know? Randall did say he left in a hurry. - I don't know how he could forget it. There were some good-looking antiques there. - Well, I'll talk to Lindsay tomorrow. Maybe she can tell me where to get ahold of him. - Mm-hmm. - Right after I take care of the phones and the Internet. - No rush. - I kind of like the quiet. No phones, no Internet to take up our lives. Mccaffreys unplugged. - Yeah. - Really? - Yeah, mom's right. It gives us a chance to talk. Just the four of us. - Yeah. It's called family time. - Something we're gonna have a lot more of. - Right. - Right, buddy? - Right. - Well, um, I'll clear the table. - Oh, I got to make the beds. - You're done, right? - Jenny, I'll give you a hand. - Well, I guess we're done talking. - Okay, so we just have to unload everything and then we'll be good, je... What... Honey, could... It's all right. I got it. Don't you worry. You just, you know, do your thing. I'll do everything else. - Honey, could... - hey, have you seen my half-inch drill bit? - Yeah, it's in my bag next to the socket wrench and the miter saw. - Sorry. - Thank you. - I had it just a minute ago. - Where's Oliver? - He's testing out his new library card. - Hmm. Curtains look different. - That is the third time that's happened. - Honey, is this the drill bit you were looking for? - What? - It was right there. - But i... - Emery falls of yesteryear. Mm. These pictures were taken during the great depression. Hey, there, Oliver. Small world. - Eloise. - So what do you think? - It's great. - You know, these children, they didn't have two pennies to rub together, but they never missed a day of school. - They must've really liked it then. - They loved Mr. Rutledge. - Clive Rutledge? - One and the same. - That's the guy who lived at my house. - Mm-hmm. Course that was taken when he was just starting out. He taught here for more than 30 years. - Wow. - He was so happy then. - All righty, then. Let's see if this works. Yes! Look out world, Jenny McCaffrey is back. - Hey, kid. Little help. - Sure. - Are you going to practice today? - Dude, hurry up. - Nice kick. - Yeah, for a girl. - We'll finish our homework after. - Jenny! I could use some help down here in my new office. This is the third time I've had to ask you. - Five more minutes, I promise. - Jenny, I am not gonna ask you again. - Okay, okay, I'm coming. - Jennifer Margaret McCaffrey! - Okay! Ew. Ew, what is that smell? - So I'm thinking this for the kitchen. And... - Who was that guy in the attic? - In the attic? - Yeah. - I don't think so. - I saw him. - When Lindsay first showed us the place, she said some previous owners had remodeled. - Yeah, did a renovation, closed off the attic. No one's been up there for years. - At least I just smell things. - I saw him. - Thanks, Ron. Doug McCaffrey. - I got a scoop for you, Mr. Editor. Our phones work. - Why, baby, you're back in business. - Looks that way. How are things going over there? - Uh, crazy. Lot of catching up to do. I may have to miss dinner. - Doug. - Honey, it's just this once. I promise. - I'll keep a plate warm. - Okay. - Doug? When you have a minute. - Honey, I got to go. - Not too late. - Yeah. Famous last words. - Bye. - Bye. - I thought dad didn't have to work late anymore. - Oh, honey, being editor is a big job. He might just have to put in a few more hours. - It's gonna be like before. We're never gonna see him. - No, it won't, sweetie. It's just until he settles in. Hello? Karen McCaffrey. Yes, Mrs. Garber. Could you hold for one second? Honey, it's Mrs. Garber. She finally made a decision about the color of her living room. I have to take it before she changes her mind again. Hi! Right, just give me one second to get in my office and I will work that out for you. Yes. Well, we just moved and... Don't worry. We got it covered. - Where is it? - Where's what? - This isn't funny. Give it back. - I don't know what you're talking about. I put my mp3 on my desk and now it's gone. - Well, I didn't take it. - Then where is it? - How should I know? - Mom! - She's on the phone. - Dad! - Still at work. - Great. Just like old times. - Yep. Just like old times. - Okay, okay, okay. Let's settle down, everybody. Let's settle down. Take your seats, take your seats, take your seats. Let's get started. - Hey, kid. - Okay. We have a new student this year. Mr. Oliver McCaffrey. I want everyone to welcome him. All right? Good. All right, let's open our books to page four please. Come on, let's go. - I told you to get out of my way. - We could save a lot of time if you just tell me which way you want me to pass. - What are you, some kind of smart guy? - If I say no, will you leave me alone? - No. - And if say yes? - Probably just make it worse. - So you were being rhetorical? - What'd you call me? - Hey! Is there a problem? - No, Mr. Buckley. Right, Mick? - No problem, Mr. Buckley. Just making a new friend. - See you tomorrow... Oliver. - Hollow. ♪ - Didn't you parents ever tell you not to touch what isn't yours? And it's impolite to stare. As well as shine a flashlight in a man's face! - Who... who... - Boo. - Aah! Aah! - You smashed a hole in the wall? - Whoa. - Wow. No one's been up here for a long time. - Huh. Oliver. - Is he gone? - Nobody's here. - Are you sure? - For goodness sakes. - Come on, Oliver. There's nothing to be afraid of. Oliver, watch out! - Jenny. - Not funny. - Dude, get a grip. - Enough, all right. It's late. We'll talk about this tomorrow. - Yeah. - Come on. - There... no! There really was a man here. And he was dressed in old-timey clothes. And he told me not to touch anything and then... - whoo. - Mom? - Anybody else feel that? - What was that? - I told you. There's somebody up here, and he's probably watching us right now. - Oliver, this isn't funny. - It's not me. - Oliver, why is the window open? - Duh. - Oliver... What would possess you to smash a hole in the wall? Just to prove that there was somebody up here? Tomorrow after school, you will clean up that mess. Now come on. Everybody, downstairs. Jenny, come on. - No, it wasn't my imagination! There really was somebody up here. He's real. - Oliver... enough! It is time to go to bed. I don't know why anybody would want to leave all their stuff up here. Oliver, bed! Listen to your mother! - Oh, gross! There's that smell again. - Thank you. - Anytime, ma'am. - And? - It's all fine. - No dead bats? - No dead bats. And no dead bugs. Nothing. Does it smell okay? - Yeah. Karen McCaffrey. Hello? Hello? Karen McCaffrey. Hello? - Hey, mom? - Not right now, honey. - When's dad coming home? - As soon as he can. - Do we have any donuts? - Oh, honey, can't you have something more hearty? Donuts aren't brain food. - Oliver is the brain. - They're on the table. - You know, I could use a little help around here. There's boxes everywhere. - Yeah, I know. I'm doing the best I can. - Well, it's not good enough. I can't get it done by myself. - Sweetheart, I have a job to do. - Uh, so do I. - You're funny. - I'm not trying to be funny. - What do you want? - Oliver? - Who are you talking to? - What do you want, man? - I'm going to school. - I'll walk with you. - No, you won't. - Thanks again, Ethan, for the Internet password. - No problem. - Our house is a mess. So where should we work on our project? - We can meet at my house. Or the library. - I'd like that. - Check you later. - Hey! - True to life ghost stories. What are you always reading this ghost stuff for? - Nothing. Give it back. - Hey, Tony, maybe he's getting ready for Halloween. - That figures. Only a dork like Oliver would think a ghost is scary. - You wouldn't say that if you've actually met one. - What? - Nothing. - No, come on, Oliver. What are you saying? You actually see ghosts? - Never mind. - No, seriously. What's it like? Do they talk to you? - I got to go. - Well, he's not happy. - Well, he's still fitting in. - Maybe it's not him. Maybe it's me. This isn't exactly going according to plan. - Hey, I don't like working these hours any more than you do. - No, it's not just you. I mean, I'm putting in double the time just to prove to my clients that the move hasn't changed anything. - Well, it hasn't, has it? - I don't know. I just... i feel caught up in it all. Like I'm forgetting why we moved here in the first place. - Yeah, you're right. You know, sometimes I come home late, and I'm so tired I think I'm seeing things. - Really? 'Cause sometimes I feel like someone's watching me... In the house. And I keep answering the phone and nobody's there. Except this piano music. - Weird. - Yeah. - Remember Dexter, the guy who sold us the house? - Yeah. - All right, well, I finally tracked him down. He's in some place in Alaska. I asked him about the furniture, the stuff in the basement. - What'd he say? - He said it wasn't his. He said all the previous owners have been too afraid to move it. - Afraid? Why? - Wouldn't say. Just wished us luck and he hung up. - Luck? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, great. - Mom, I'm home. Mom? Clive? - Wait! Hey! I know you're up here. I just want to talk to you. You have to stop what you're doing. This is our house now. We live here. Don't be ridiculous. This is myhouse, and I will thank you to vacate it immediately. And take the rest of your noisy mob with you. And close your mouth! You're not a trout. - Whoa. - Brilliantly put. May I quote you? "Whoa." Positively shakespearian. - You're really here. - Another brilliant observation. I can see nothing gets past you. - Are you clive Rutledge? - Go away. - I'm Oliver. Oliver McCaffrey. - How nice for you. - Well, the book said you'd be cranky. - So you read. I suppose that's something. - But they didn't say anything about sarcastic. - Oh, well then I do apologize. What possible excuse could I have for being disagreeable? Just because my home's been invaded, my things have all been moved around without so much as a "by your leave." - But... - and a rude young man who interrupts me while I'm talking. You need to remember your manners, lad. - Well, you need to stop leaving your junk all around the house. - Junk? I'll have you know these are my prized possessions. And I will put them wherever I like. - Wait. So that's your stuff in the basement? - Of course it's my stuff! Whose else would it be? This is my house. - That's what I'm trying to tell you. This isn't your house anymore. We live here... me and my family. - My family and I. And we shall soon see about that. - I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to scare us off with all your weird stuff and you making noises and you playing your dumb piano. - Excuse me? - But it's not gonna work. They think I'm doing it, like I need the attention or something. - Well, you needn't worry. I can be very convincing when I want to be. - Yeah, well, good luck with that. You'll never get them to notice you. - And why is that? - Because half the time they don't even notice me. - Why? - They just... - well, if you don't like what I'm doing, you can get out, all of you. The sooner the better. - Clive and Sarah. June 3, 1929. - Oliver, you want some more meatloaf? - No thanks. - Jenny? - I'm fine. - Okay. - I picked up a pie for dessert from that little bakery. - Oh, the one on the corner that always smells so good? - They bake 'em fresh right there. Beautiful, local fruit only. Couldn't resist. - Yum! So have you guys decided what you're gonna be for Halloween? - Not yet. - Jenny? - I don't know. Something different. - I hear there's a big party at the high school on Halloween night. That'll be fun. - Super fun! - Are you guys getting a divorce or something? - What? No! Why? - Why are you acting so weird? - What? - Like Stepford parents. - Yeah, it's kind of freaky. - Look, we're just... We're talking... Like a family... 'Round the table. Dinner, you know? - Your dad and I want you both to know that we haven't forgotten why we moved to Emery falls in the first place. - That we're here for you. If there's anything you want to talk about, anything at all. - Whatever is on your mind. - What? - Oh, I get what this is about. It's because he's been acting all weird with the ghost stuff. - It's not weird! - Okay, mom, even the kids at school are talking about it. He walks around with these dumb books. - Jenny. - Kids are making fun of him because he only talks about ghosts. - Who wants pie? - All he has are imaginary ghost friends. - Clive's not my friend. He's a jerk, and he's not imaginary. - Who's clive? - Clive Rutledge. He used to live here. That's his stuff in the basement. - How do you know that? - Because he told me. - Clive told you? - You're not actually listening to this stuff. - He wants us to leave. - Where does clive want us to go? - I don't think he cares. - Would clive want us to move back to our other house? - I guess. - Because maybe he's happier there. - What? - They're talking about you, genius. - Buddy, we know this move has been difficult for you. - That's what this is about? The whole family dinner thing? You're just trying to make me feel better? I'm not making this up. - What is that? - It's coming from the attic. Oliver, how could you do this? - It wasn't me! - Oh, I'm sure. - It was clive. He's here. He's watching us. - Oliver! You have to stop this right now. Do you understand? Enough! Now clean this stuff up, go to your room, do your homework, or something. - Clive. - I thought you were very persuasive at the dinner table. I had hoped that this would sway them to take it more seriously. - Well, it didn't. - Yes, well, clearly. - Why don't you just let them see you already and quit picking on me all the time? - Don't you think I'm trying? It doesn't work on everyone. - Well, why not? - Because certain people are more predisposed to this sort of thing. Their minds are open. They're more receptive to seeing, like you. - Lucky me. - I'm trying my best. - Can't you try harder? I'm tired of the way they keep looking at me. Well, I guess I better get this cleaned up. - No, Oliver, allow me. - Wow! - There are certain advantages. - What are you doing? - I found one of your books in my room. I want to know how it got there. I'm returning it. - I put it there. - You did? - Well, you seem to be reasonably bright, all things considered. And appear to have a genuine interest in science. So you may as well be properly educated on the subject. - I can read it? - You may. - Now what are you doing? - Reading. - Well, as long as you keep quiet. I have a great deal of work to do, and I'd appreciate... - shh! I'm reading. - I'm so late! - There. - Mom! Mom, I'm so late! - Bye. You got to eat something. Here. Okay, have a banana. - No time. - Please. - Fine. - Please. - Yes. I give up. Ugh! - Bye. - Well, I guess I'll go to school. - No, I think that's great. It's gonna match the blue in the carpet. Well, I'm gonna make sure they have it in stock. - Hey, mom, I got my test back. You want to see? - Absolutely. Yeah, we have three weeks. Plenty of time. Let me see, we could push the... Let me check. - Hey, mom, I got expelled today. - That's great, honey. Yes, we can move the couch delivery to Thursday, which keeps us in good time... Hello? Hello? Hello! No, no, no. Don't do this to me. Hello? Hello? - Give it back. - You want it, come get it. - Come get it, dork. - Be careful. It's not mine. They threw it on the ground. I'm really sorry. - Well, it's not your fault. The book's not too worse for wear. Do you know these boys? - They're in my class. - Then you need to tell your parents. - My parents won't do anything. - Of course they will. - My parents won't do anything because they don't care. - Oliver. - Mom, dad, Jenny. They've all got more important stuff to worry about like friends or work. Everything except for me. I could just disappear and they wouldn't even care. They promised it'd be different. That's why we came here. To spend more time together and be like a real family. But... nothing's changed. They promised! And they broke their promise. I wish I'd never come here. - But then... You and I would never have met. And would a shame that would've been for me. - You mean it? - Oliver, we can't choose our families. But our friends, well, that's another matter. And sometimes they come along when you least expect it. Let me show you something I discovered. Clive. Oliver. - Neat. - Yeah. Neat. Let me tell you something else. When it comes to bullies, I have absolutely no Patience. - I'll get him outside. You throw the pumpkin guts on him. Got it? - Got it. Both: Aah! - Yes? Happy Halloween, gentlemen. - They could see you. - So it would seem. - Thanks. - Think nothing of it. They had it coming. - Would you please stop doing that? - Priceless. Oh, please. - What's so funny? - Well... They haven't a clue. I mean, they write with such conviction about ghosts and spirits and whatnot, and they have no idea what it's like. - What is it like? You never talk about it. - Well, I'm here. What else is there to say? - I know, but do you ever wonder what it's about? Why you're here? - I never stop wondering. I never stop wishing that... - what? - Oliver? - Up here, mom. - Whatcha doing? - Reading. - I thought I heard you talking to somebody. - Mom, I'm the only one up here. - Right. Um, well, it's late. It's time for bed. - Okay. - When am I gonna find the time to clear all this out? - Eloise? Can I ask you a question? - Fire away. - Do you believe in ghosts? - Well, if you're referring to all that rattling chains and moaning in the graveyard kind of thing, then I guess I'd have to say no, probably not. - Then what do you believe in? - Well, I believe that there is something inside each of us way down deep. Something we can't see or touch, but it's there. Kind of an essence of who we are. - Kind of like a soul. - Yeah, some people call it that. Some call it a spirit. A life force. It really doesn't matter what you call it. It's what you do with it that matters. - What do you mean by that? - Well, we're all put on earth with the potential to do or be anything we can imagine. We can make this a better place. Or we can just take up space in a crowded world. It's up to us to decide. But either way, life is short. People tend to, you know, put things off, figure they'll get around to it one of these days. Well, before you know it, it's too late. They wake up one morning and they realize they never did the things that they could've or should've. - And they still wish they did? - Yeah. And I suppose that sometimes if it's important enough and if they wish hard enough, they hang around after their time trying to get done the things that they didn't do in life. - And those are ghosts? The ones who hang around? - That's the way I see it, anyway. - I mean, does it ever work? Do they ever get done what they should've done when they were alive? - I hope so. It's the only way they can find peace and move on. - What are you writing? - Do your homework. - Looks like you're writing a letter. Looks like you're writing the same letter over and over. - You know, I believe we had an understanding, that you can stay up here as long as you're quiet. - Sorry. - Thank you. - You must really like Halloween with all those pumpkins back there. - For the love of Mike, what is it? Oliver, what is on our mind? - Nothing, I was just thinking about... Well, I don't really know anything about you. - Well, fine. If it'll keep you quiet. I detest Halloween. It's a sorry excuse for immature behavior and childish pranks. - Well, then why all the pumpkins? - For Elizabeth, my daughter. It was her favorite time. She loved everything about it. Those pumpkins, are they still growing? - Yeah, you want to see? - Perhaps another time. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Nothing is wrong, it's just... Oliver, I can't actually leave the house. I'm stuck here. - Why? - I don't know why. I just am. Just like not everyone can see me, just like I can only play the one tune on the piano. Just like a half dozen other rules that I don't understand. - Well... I need a pumpkin for Halloween. You could help me choose one. - You are a very persistent young man. - Hmm. Which one do you think? How about this one? - It's okay. Lots of kids have imaginary friends. - This one? You like it? I like it. Looks like you're it, big boy. - Oh, yummy. - Yummy. Eloise said that these are volunteers. That the seeds come directly from the ones that clive Rutledge planted over 85 years ago. - You're taking quite an interest in old clive. - Well, we are living in his house. - Well, it was his house. It's ours now. - I know, I just mean that not much has changed since he lived here. - Oh, come on. I can only work so fast. But tomorrow I am clearing out that basement. I'm gonna clear all that stuff out and take it to charity. What was that? Okay, it's just an old house. - Mom, the stuff in the basement doesn't belong to us. - Well, technically, it came with the house. - So shouldn't it stay with the house? Technically? - You know, I don't think old clive would mind. Boo. - I mind a very great deal, and I will not stand for it. - Clive, please. Maybe if I just talk to 'em, I can work it out. - No, no, you... I know you mean well, Oliver, but you couldn't possibly understand. - I do, really. This is your stuff. - This is my life. All that I have left of it. I will not have it taken from me. - Clive, please. - It's cold. - So... How was everybody's day? Was that good, huh? - It's like a tiny time capsule. And you found this in the basement? - Well, I thought since you knew so much about the town and all, I might as well ask you. Their daughter Elizabeth. She was born the year after he and Sarah were married. - On the back it says 1930. - That sounds about right. My mother was one of clive's students. She said that after Elizabeth was born, he didn't stop smiling for a week. - Did they have any other children? - No, I'm afraid not. God took Sarah before he had a chance. - She died? - There was an outbreak of Scarlet fever the next year. The whole country suffered terribly, but it was especially hard here. We lost so many good people. Mother said that after Sarah passed, clive nearly lost Elizabeth as well, but he never left her side. If was as though he willed that child to live. - Well, did he ever remarry? - No. It just wasn't in him. And he was devoted to that little girl. He raised her by himself. - Well, whatever happened to her? - I don't recall. But that's how it is in a small town. The young people grow up, and then, first chance they get, they want to go out and see the world. - I bet he misses her. - Honey, clive Rutledge has been dead for over 40 years. He doesn't miss anybody anymore. - I detest Halloween. - Well, then why all the pumpkins? - For Elizabeth. It was her favorite time. - Can I help you, young man? - I'm looking for my dad. Doug McCaffrey. - Oh. You must be Oliver. Hi. Randall Parker. Nice to finally meet you. - You too. Is he here? - Oh, you just missed him. Your mother called, and he had to run home. - Okay. Thanks. - Is there something else on your mind? - How would I find out about something that might've been in the paper a long time ago? - Well, what do you want to know? - Was there ever anything in the paper about something bad happening on Halloween in Emery falls? - Hmm, not that I recall. - Thanks anyway. - You're welcome to look on your own if you'd like. We have a lot of old editions. Going way back. - Really? - Yeah. Fair warning though, we only have the last few years on computer. The rest are in the archives back there. You're gonna have to dig through 'em by hand. If you want to get started, you can use your dad's computer. - Okay. - Go ahead. Did you find what you were looking for? - No, sir. - Well, you're welcome to use the archives. - Another time. I have to go. - Take care. - Hey, dad? Mom? - What do you have to say, young man? - Oliver... We've been very patient up till now, but this... this... Buddy, this is too much. - But dad, I couldn't do something like this. - Oh, please. - Jenny. - Mom, I can't even invite my friends over, because I don't know when he's gonna start making crazy noises in the attic or tapping on the walls. - But that's not me doing that, that's clive. - Oliver, this has got to stop. - Son... We know that you're unhappy here, and that it is an adjustment moving into a new home. - What we don't understand is why you feel compelled to blame it on a ghost. - Have you considered that he might be telling the truth? - What was that? - No, whowas that? - Here we go. - Oliver? - Look out, honey. Get down. - Clive, what are you doing? Stop it. - Mom! Dad! - What is happening? - Oliver, make it stop! - Everybody, get down, please. Oliver! - Look out! - Oh, my god! Look out. - Clive, knock it off. Come on. - Perhaps next time you'll listen to the lad. Oliver, they see me. - No kidding. - But remember what I said? Certain people are more receptive. I've been trying. Look at them. I'd say we made quite a breakthrough. - Clive, don't... Don't even think about it. No. - Boo. - Aah! Oliver, come on! - Oliver! Oliver! - Are you crazy? - What? They deserve it. They don't listen. They don't pay attention. Honestly, I don't know how you put up with them. - They're my family. - That's no excuse. - Are you guys okay? - Who was that? - Why must they always say that first? - Mom, dad, Jenny, this is clive Rutledge. The one I've been telling you about. - And now that we've been properly introduced, let me just say it has been my distinct displeasure to have you in my home. - Your home? - Dad. - And I urge you to vacate at your earliest convenience. - You want usto leave? - Yes, I want you to leave. I cannot abide these distractions in my home. - But this is not your home. This is our home. Our family. This is our new home. - Oh, I see. And family's important to you, is it? - Yes, it's the most important thing. - And Oliver, he's part of that family? - Of course he is. Oliver, honey, come here. - And yet somehow you've all managed to ignore what he's been trying to tell you for weeks. - Ignore him? We haven't ignored Oliver. - No. What you did was much worse. - You've made him feel like there was something wrong with him for wanting you to keep a promise. - Clive, it's okay. - You did promise, didn't you? To be here more often, to be a family. That's why you moved here. - Yes. And we will. Soon. - Yeah, I know, this new job, it's just so much more demanding than you expected. The hard work, the long hours, all that responsibility. It's not your fault you couldn't be here. - Clive, come on. - But you're here, aren't you? All the time. You work here. You design things for people. For other people. - Yes. Well, I mean... - And who can blame you for wanting to keep them happy? After all, they need to know that you haven't lost your touch. And if that means staying on the phone night and day, ad nauseam, well, sacrifices must be made, huh? - My brother was right. You are a jerk. - You know, I'm surprised you ever heard a word your brother said with those silly doohickeys in your ears. - Doohickeys? - Your mp3 player. - Perhaps if you took them out once in a while, young lady, you would notice that your brother has been the victim of bullying. Almost from the day he got here. - Well, I... - A kind word. A helping hand. A solid right cross to that rascal's jaw. Anything. But no. Too much to ask. Of any of you. 'Cause you're all so caught up in your own lives that you can't even see the extraordinary younman right in front of you. A family listens. Above all, a family always listens. - Oliver, honey? - It's okay, you guys. Really. He didn't mean any of that stuff. Just ignore him. - No. I never thought I'd say this about a ghost, but he was right. - We should have believed you, bud. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry too. We did make a promise. This was supposed to be our new start, and we got caught up and forgot what really matters. Your friend clive is right. Can we try again? Is that okay? Try again? - Yeah. - Buddy, I have a question. Was it true about what he said about those bullies? - It's true. I'm sorry, Oliver. I saw those boys picking on you, and I didn't do anything. I was just too afraid of what my friends would think. - It's okay. I understand. - It's not okay. You're my little brother, and I'm supposed to take care of you, and that's way more important than being popular. - I think we should all start paying a lot more attention to each other. Yeah? Starting now. - Yeah. Yeah. And at least we now know why Dexter left in such a hurry. And why we got such a good deal on this place. - Right. And why all that stuff sat in a basement for 40 years. - Yeah, they knew. All those people that came before us, they knew. They were too afraid to touch it. - Right. Clive wouldn't let them. I guess he just scared them off instead. - Well, why wouldn't they tell anyone? - For the same reason we're not gonna tell anyone when we move out. Because they'll think we're nuts. - Move? - Yeah, well, I mean, honey, we... we can't live here now. - Why not? - We don't have much choice. - Yeah, Oliver, I don't know much about ghosts, but i... i think the way it works is when they tell you to leave, you leave. - But he's not like that. Really. Can I just talk to him? - He's a ghost. He's a real ghost. You can't have a conversation with a ghost. - Dad... You just did. - Clive? - I suppose they're scared half out of their wits, huh? - Yeah. - Ready to pack their bags, are they? - Yeah. - And you? - Thanks for what you said. - I shouldn't have lost my head. I got kind of carried away. They still love you, Oliver. - I know. - This house used to be full of love. My wife, my daughter. They were my world. I... i never stop thinking about them. Elizabeth, that's my daughter, used to come up here to play while I would be preparing my school lessons or playing the piano. She even had a thing where she had her toys that she would keep in this little secret compartment that only she and I knew about. Course, as she got older, we spent less time together. - But you still loved her. - Takes more than love. Takes Patience, understanding, and forgiveness. These are the things that make a family strong. Without them... Even the sturdiest bond can be broken, and then... One day you may just discover it's too late to fix it. And it's too late to undo... - To undo a mistake. - Yeah. - Something happened when clive was alive. Something to do with his family and Halloween. I don't know what it was, but I think that's why he's still here. And that's why we have to go to the newspaper office. - So this is clive and his family? - He made a mistake. And he can't forgive himself for it. - They look so happy. - He loved them more than anything. Now he's stuck here because of whatever he did. We have to help him. We have to set him free. - Honey, listen, we want to help clive too, but how can we? We don't even know why he's stuck here. - He told me that a family is the strongest bond. - Well, I guess he's right about that. - If we don't help him, he'll be a ghost forever and he'll never get to see his family again. Please. We have to help him. - And we will, but why are we here? - What do you want us to do? - We have to find out everything there is to know about clive. It's the only way we can figure out why he's still here. - Okay, but sweetie, why are we here at dad's work? - Yeah. - We have to go through the archives. - Come on, guys. - Buddy, this newspaper is over a hundred years old. There's gonna be thousands of copies to go through. - Sweetie, it could take weeks. - Or longer. - Not with the album. There's a picture in there from every important time in clive's life, and every picture has a date on the back. - Narrow it down. Okay. Let's give it a go. - 1930. - We can compare the picture dates to the paper dates, and we see if anything bad happened, and if it had anything to do with clive. - Hmm. Sounds like a plan. - I'm impressed. - Here. - "Couple announces their engagement to be married. "Mr. Clive Rutledge, "the new school teacher at Emery falls, and miss Sarah eugenia Covington." - "The happy couple is pleased to announce "the birth of Elizabeth Rutledge. On October 31st at 9:30 A.M." She was born on Halloween. ♪ - "Loving wife and mother, "Mrs. Sarah eugenia Rutledge "was taken by the hand of the lord to a quieter, gentler place." - "An inspiring valedictory address for the class of 1948 was given by Elizabeth Rutledge." That's all it says about her. - That's it. - I don't understand. I mean, Sarah died, but after that everything seems fine. - Yeah. I mean, the only connection he had to Halloween was Elizabeth's birth. That's a good thing, right? - So why's he still here? - We should just go home. - No, no, no. Honey, wait. We're gonna find a way to help clive. We are. - No, we've been through all the pictures. We know everything there is to know about him. This was just a big waste of time. - He loved them both so much. Now he'll never get to see them again. - I still don't understand what he had against Halloween. I mean, all those birthdays, all those celebrations. - Honey, be careful. - It won't go in. - All right, look, I will help you. Wait a minute. These two pages are stuck together. - What's that? - It's postmarked November 1st, 1948. It's addressed to clive. "Mr. and Mrs. Abe walden "are happy to announce the marriage of their son Howard to miss Elizabeth Rutledge." - Elizabeth got married? - In 1948. But why would she send clive an invitation? Wouldn't he be there anyway? - Let me see that. Huh. It's not an invitation. It's an announcement. They were already married. - You mean clive didn't go to his own daughter's wedding? - November 1st. That's the day after Halloween. - All right. Elizabeth was born in 1930. She was married November 1st, 1948, the day after her 18th birthday. - The first day she could get married without her parents' consent. - They eloped. - She ran away? - Sort of. It's, um, what people used to do if their parents didn't approve of the marriage. - Yeah, don't even think about it, Jen. That is why there are no more pictures of her, because she never came home. - He never saw her again. - We have to find her. - I'll get it. Both: Trick or treat! - Ha ha. Happy Halloween. Both: Thank you. - You're the scariest two I've ever seen. Have a good night. Go give someone a fright. Both: Happy Halloween. - Oh, the Halloween teeth. - Yes. - I was kind of hoping that would be her. - Don't worry. It's still early. Come on. - Trick or treat! - Hi. Um, help yourself. - Okay. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Happy Halloween. - Be safe. - Happy Halloween. - What was the pirate movie rated? - Arr. - What's the pirate's favorite letter in the alphabet? - Arr. - Arr. You think it'd be "r," but it's really the "c." - I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll ge it. - You think it's her? - Oh, I'm sorry to disturb you. Uh, my name is Betty walden. And I got a message from an Oliver... McCaffrey. - Yes, please come in. We weren't sure if you were gonna make it. We're so happy you're here. Oliver, it's Betty walden. - I'm Oliver. - Oliver? Well, yes. Uh, you wrote me about some things that belong to my father. - Yes. You're Elizabeth? - Oh, yes. I don't think anybody's called me by that name for a long time. But, uh, I'm Elizabeth. - Can I show you something? - Sure. - Come on. - Okay. We... we spent so much time up here when I was growing up. Yes. Oh, and sometimes... Sometimes he'd play the piano. - So you remember? - Well, yes. Uh... i haven't been here for about 60 years. But, uh, there's not a day goes by when I don't think about it. - How many times must I ask you not to touch my piano? Oh. Oh, I do beg your pardon. I... i see we have a guest. How very nice. Please make yourself at home. - I wonder... - Where's she going? What... what are you doing? Oliver, tell her. Stop her. - Oh. My toys. Look. They're... they're still here. - Elizabeth. - Oh. What's wrong? - Why didn't you ever come back? - Oh, now, Oliver, that was a long time ago. - Well, didn't you miss it? - More than anything. - What happened? - Well... It was my 18th birthday. And I was in love. - Trick or treat. - My father didn't approve. And in those days, a young woman did not go against her father's wishes. At least... Not if she ever wanted to come home again. My father told me I had to choose. So I chose. And married my one true love. All I ever wanted was to see him again, to hear his voice. But he died before I got the chance. But I have had a wonderful life. I love my family. And I never regretted my choice. No. Not for a moment. Except that my father was not a part of it. - I'm so sorry, Elizabeth. I was just a... I was a stubborn, old fool. - He still loved you, Elizabeth. - Oh, thank you, thank you, Oliver, but, uh... - No, it's true. That's what I wanted to show you. I found this photo album with his things. - Oh, you did? - I'm sure it belongs to you. - Thank you. Oh. - I just... I tried to hold you too tightly. It was... It was just to keep you safe. I was afraid of losing you. The way I lost your mother. Why can't she hear me? - I'm sure that, um, if he was here, he would want you to know how sorry he is. - And how much he loved you. - And if he could ever do it again... - Thank you, but I think my father made his feelings very clear. - If there's anything, you know, up here that you would want... - My toys. - We'll ship them to you. - Oh, thank you. Well, I really must be going, because my husband is waiting. It's my birthday. - Yeah, we know. Happy birthday. - Thank you. - You have to do something. - I... i... i can't. - Well, you have to try. - Try? Try... try... try what? - Try... try to believe that all he ever wanted to do is just make things right. - Oh. If I only could. Wait a minute. - Oh. - This is for you. - Thank you. What... - "My dear Elizabeth. "For far too many years, "I have searched for the right words "to express the regret I feel "for what I've done, "and to beg your forgiveness. "At long last, I understand. "There are no words. "Only a profound emptiness "for every lost moment of the future we did not share. "But if you ever read this letter, "I hope you will take comfort, as I do, "in knowing that we will be together again one day, "the three of us, "and I will spend eternity "earning your trust and forgiveness.
