- Morning, Dad. - Good morning, honey. Do you mind sitting at the counter? I have a Christmas Council meeting this morning. This is your second emergency meeting this week. Is there more Christmas trouble here in Midway again? Nope. Actually, I have news that could change everything. Well, it must be special news, because you broke out your mama's recipe, and you know, she only baked this for extra-special occasions. So... what is it? You're about to find out. Morning, Aria! - Hey. - We made it. Although, I think I might have concussion. Oh, hush. I was braking for the elk. No elk. Darling, you saw the antlers! Come on, ladies. There's fresh coffee and this year's featured pies, Santa's Secret Strawberry Pie and Mistletoe-Man Meringue are on the table. Mistletoe-Man Meringue! Your mom's favorite. Come on, Leslie, let's sample what's sure to be a best-seller this season. - Morning, Aria. - Hey, Craig! Your dad told me about that oven door. I should be able-- No worries. I've already fixed it. Really? Well, I know how busy you are this time of year, so I found a video online. You know, you don't have to do everything on your own, you can ask for help. You see, that would require my darling daughter to let somebody else have control. You'd be luckier to get Santa to give you the reins to his sleigh. Funny. Thanks, Dad. All right. Well, welcome, Christmas Council. Let's begin. I have big, big news. As you know, since that high-tech resort started offering those extreme ski and snowboard Christmas packages, businesses are really struggling. Tell me about it. The Sugarplum Lodge is stuck at permanent vacancy. If we don't bring back the holiday traffic, we just can't continue Christmas in Midway. You're right. Well, don't be so cheerful about it, dear. I think I may have a solution. Please direct your attention to the TV. I love this show. Mm-hmm. Join me, Sterling Masters, as we go off the beaten path for extraordinary adventures in unique locations. This... is Masters of Travel. Whoa, honey, honey, slow down. You're missing the whole program. Ah, that's just for effect. It's the ending that I want you to see. Each year, I hand-pick one city to be our featured destination for Sterling Master's "Big Holiday Adventure" for our website. I've narrowed it down to three finalists. Tokyo, Japan... Austin, Texas... ...and Midway, Utah. Be sure to check out my website to find out who will be chosen as my Big Holiday Adventure. I'll be showcasing this special city's holiday attractions, events, and, as always, encouraging fans to take the road less traveled for the ultimate Christmas experience. If Sterling Masters likes the road less traveled, then Midway is a shoo-in. Right? I mean, can you imagine? The Sterling Masters writing about our Midway. Are we gonna be on TV? I have extensive on-camera experience. Infomercials. It's still acting. No. We'll actually be featured on his website. I mean, the show is entertaining and all, but his writing is incredible. He has the way of, I don't know, making you feel like you're there with him on his travels. I'm such a huge fan. It's true. He's a huge travel influencer. One mention from Sterling Masters could put a forgotten city back on the map. Will we get to meet the handsome world traveler? I'm happy to host a welcoming party. Well, I'm sure, but let's not plan any parties just yet. We won't know if we're selected until Sterling's first article is published. We knew you'd save Christmas in Midway. If anyone could, it's you, Aria. Midway? Really? Alex, hey! I knew you'd be excited. I thought Tokyo was a lock. You know I hate writing about small towns. They're all the same. Why don't you go help decorate the office? Thanks. The lights in Tokyo are amazing, but... Midway has Christmas charm like the North Pole. No flash, all spirit. Just think, "Big Holiday Adventure in Small-town America." Has a nice ring to it. Oh, does it? And the real reason? You think I'm lying? Yeah. How do you know? Four years as your college roommate, five years as your ghostwriter, ten years as your best friend. Shall I do more math? Okay, fine. I have scheduled some promotional appearances on the West Coast. I can be "writing" the Big Holiday Adventure in Utah and take a quick flight to California. Logistically, it makes more sense to have it in Midwest than Tokyo. Midway. Same thing. Forget about my schedule. The town is perfect. This town is the size of the lobby. That's an exaggeration. What happens when someone discovers that I'm the writer behind Big Holiday Adventure, let alone everything else, and not Sterling Masters? Just do what we've always done. If someone asks, you don't know me. I'll pop in when I can. What? You write great articles, I work on my TV travel features. It's a two-man job. Always has been. It's not just that. People like Christmas in big cities because they have variety. Festivities a step above a mall Santa. Have you seen the pictures? They're adorable! Like something out of Santa's storybook. Look! They even have reindeer. Doesn't get much more Christmas than that. That is an elk. What does a reindeer look like? Small towns notice outsiders. People are going to ask questions. I guarantee it. You're the best writer I know. Make something up. Besides, you and I both know that if anyone finds out that you are actually "Sterling Masters, the travel writer," you violate your contract and we risk losing our little empire. This is definitely Sterling Masters' empire. Are you kidding? You're the one who figured out how to make traveling a career, for both of us. You. We make a great team. Always have. Yeah. I give up. I emailed your flight info, so go pack your mittens. Midway it is! I'll be the ghost of Christmas Present. No one will even know that I'm there. It's gotta be a reindeer. ♪ Deck the halls With boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la La, la, la, la ♪ ♪ 'Tis the season To be jolly ♪ Oh, my... Hey! This is beautiful, honey. You did this all by yourself? I would've helped you. Despite your micromanaging, I would've helped you. No need. Just a few final touches and it'll be ready. These lights aren't on, though. Yeah, that outlet, it's overloaded, but I have an extension cord to fix it later. I wanted to showcase all of the ornaments for the silent auction. My, oh, my. Where did you get these? From Santa's workshop direct? Close. Special-ordered from Germany. Sterling Masters featured it on last year's Big Holiday Adventure. They look expensive. You know, honey, the auction is supposed to raise money for the parks and rec center. What-- What if this Sterling thing just doesn't pan out? Where's your Christmas faith? You're right. They're beautiful! And they're gonna attract bidders. And-And it's perfect, and I am so proud of you. Let's just hope they're perfect for Sterling Masters, too. He'll be here. Crossing my fingers. I'm gonna help you right now. No, go home. I'm almost done here. Okay. Goodnight. Goodnight. So, apparently, this town eats dinner at exactly sundown. You know where I would not have this problem? A place called Tokyo. You shouldn't be a late-night eater. It's bad for digestion. Could be why you're so cranky. Thank you, Mother. Still starving. Worst case, the gas station has to be open. You're not in Siberia. Hang on, hold on, we may have a winner. Looks like the... "Mistletoe Diner" still has its lights on. There you go! Sounds like a Christmas dream come true. Who needs a big city, right? Right. I'm running in. I'll call you later. Hello? Hello? ♪ O, come all ye faithful ♪ ♪ Joyful and triumphant ♪ ♪ O, come, ye O, come, ye ♪ - ♪ To Bethle-- ♪ - Excuse me. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to startle you. That's okay. I'm so happy that you're open. Oh, we're not. Sorry. My staff just left. Pie? Coffee? A mint? Anything, I am desperate. What are you doing? I am assisting. I have it under control. My great catch suggests otherwise. Be careful. It took me all day to hang this. Done! Pie? Told you, we're closed. Looks like you're missing some lights on this tree. Wait, wait, wait! That outlet was overloaded. Yeah. Fixable? Yeah. But I told you I didn't need any assistance. Yeah, you really did. So... how about that pie? All right, come on. Just don't break anything else. I'll be honest. I did not have high hopes for this place, but this may be the best pie I've ever had. Should I take that as a compliment? Well, you know small-town diners. It's a toss-up. This is clearly not from a box. Give my regards to the owner, please. - You just did. - Really? Family business. Mom made the pies and the menus, and Dad ran the books. I took over the family business after he retired. Well, with food this good, you guys need to stay open later. My favorite diners, they're open 24 hours. Where are you from? San Francisco. You're a long way from home, Mister...? Just Alex. You sound like you're a long way from home yourself. Mama always said, "Aria, you can take the girl out of North Carolina, but you can't take North Carolina out of the girl." So, what brings you to our humble Midway? I know it wasn't to visit this "questionable" small-town diner. I'm working on my mystery novel. Thought the mountain air might clear my head. So here I am. What's going with the ornaments? You throwing a party? It's our silent auction for our Christmas Council's annual fundraiser for Midway's parks and rec center. Wow. Midway loves Christmas. Mistletoe Diner, Christmas Council... there's a Sugarplum Lodge? Mm-hmm. Is Santa's workshop nearby? Come on. Really? I mean, I didn't expect a small town in the middle of nowhere to be so creative about the holidays. Well, is that something only reserved for the big cities? Small towns settle for a Mall Santa? Honestly, it does tend to be that way. Well, thank you for your honesty. I hope it puts you on Santa's nice list, because your attitude won't. How long are you here for? Three weeks. Really? Over Christmas. What about your family? On their annual Christmas cruise. Well, I'm sure you'll be missed. You know, there's one thing we have in common with San Francisco. - What's that? - To-go boxes. Oh. Right. May I please have this whole pie? I'll ring you up. Thank you. Hey, Leslie. Hi. Thanks for coming and helping me decorate the tree. I lost another front desk clerk to the new ski resort. You're a lifesaver. Well, how's everything else around here, other than losing half your staff? Couple of new guests. One's pretty cute. Want me to introduce you? Pass. You'll never know if someone will measure up to your impossible fairy-tale standards if you don't even give them a chance. I do not have fairy-tale standards. Then what would you call that "Mistletoe Man" of yours? The impossible devoted gentleman who climbs the highest mountains, the tallest trees, et cetera, et cetera, all to prove his love? It's more than that. A true Mistletoe Man is like a gift from the universe, not some random lodger your best friend thought was cute. After that break-up in New York, you might as well have shut yourself up in a tower. Moving on. So, any interesting guests check in lately? You think I'd be standing here talking about fictional Mistletoe Men if Sterling Masters had checked in? Christmas is three weeks away. He should be here by now. Maybe we didn't win. Maybe he rented a cabin. We won't know for sure until his first article posts. Stay positive. I just hope that I get the chance to thank him in person. I mean, not just for coming to Midway, but for taking me around the world. He's so talented. Alex. Hi. Something wrong with your breakfast, or do you always eavesdrop? As a writer, I'm a trained listener. It's a... It's a skill. Really? Yet you lack the ability to read a room. Well, truth is, I couldn't help but overhear your passionate praise for Sterling Masters. "Talented" is a bit of a stretch. He stands in front of a camera and reads a TelePrompTer. I mean, the show's great, but his writing made me a true fan. How so? He puts his heart and soul into words. It's like I really know him. Well, sometimes, the person you see on TV is not always the same in real life. Oh, I understand now. Understand what? You're jealous. - Jealous? - Well, yeah. Sterling is an accomplished, best-selling writer. Just because someone is more successful doesn't make it okay to put 'em down. Uh, now, Aria, let's not go insulting the few guests we have. Sorry. It's early. She hasn't had her coffee yet. Read Sterling's Big Holiday Adventure. Maybe it'll give you some inspiration. Sorry! Yeah, maybe I will. Everything good over here? Welcome to the Mistletoe Diner. Oh. You. Can I get you a cup of coffee? I would love some. Thank you. Shouldn't you be writing? Well, I heard Santa was gonna make an appearance. Uh, can't miss that. Could be inspiring. Santa? For a mystery novel? Well, I always need a good red herring. What's the name of your book again? The book is called The... Mistletoe Mystery. Huh. I'll get that coffee. "Mistletoe Mystery." Nice. Ho, ho, ho. There's no frowning at Christmas. I'm sorry, Santa, you weren't supposed to see that. There you go. Santa sees everything. But, lucky for you... I'm just Santa's helper. And I need a break. I don't know how to pronounce half the things those kids are asking for. You know, back in my day, all I wanted was a bb-gun and a bike. Well, I think that's why Santa hires helpers. Yeah. So are you new in town? Just visiting. Well, there's no better place to be on Christmas than Midway. Oh! I have a job to do. Hang on there, young man. Um... This... is your official Midway Christmas passport, and there is a stamp... for every event. There you go. Is this is a Midway or Mistletoe Diner tradition? Well, actually, it's a little bit of both. You see, my wife created the Christmas Council. They're the people that plan for this event all year long. Well, it was her dream that everybody should have a place where they feel they're going home for the holidays. Just like us. That's nice. Where is Mrs. Claus? Is she here? Ah, well, I lost her a couple years ago. I'm so sorry. Yeah. But, you know, celebrating Christmas is just like celebrating her. She named this "the Mistletoe Diner" when we bought it years ago. And she said that it was for me, but I had a sneaky feeling that she just wanted Christmas all year round. Right. Santa, you're still on duty. I am stamping passports, honey, stamping passports. You two related? Yeah, I'm Mack Eubanks and this is my daughter. Alex Bartlett. So you two know each other? She was kind enough to stay open late to feed a weary traveler. After I helped her decorate. You really are a fiction writer. He startled me, when he snuck in after hours for pie. Question, is it strange to order pie for breakfast? Absolutely not! My new friend here will have a big slice of your Nutcracker Honey-Pecan Pie, please. All right. Coming right up. I don't think she likes me, Santa. Oh... she's just a little stressed, that's all. You see, there's this travel expert that's gonna come and cover some of the events here in Midway. Do you know a man named Sterling Masters? Vaguely. Oh, please do not tell her. She'll be on you like ticks on a dog. We're just hoping that he can put us back on the map a little bit, you know, bring in some tourists. Oh. Is business down? We have seen better days. But she's doing everything she can. Oh! Say. You should come to the tree-lighting ceremony tonight. You'll see her in her element, and she is goo-ood. Well, I can't say no to Santa. Plus, I gotta fill this passport. Absolutely. And I... gotta get back to work. Good luck. Ho, ho, ho, ho! All right. There we go. Thank you. Hi, Leslie. Hi, Alex. Miss Aria Eubanks, I believe I'm in need... of a stamp. You know that this is only good for Midway Christmas attractions, right? So I've heard. So far, very impressed. Well, we're just tryin' to keep up with the big cities. Aria? Stick around. The magic is just getting started. You ready? Absolutely. You know, I was the understudy for the lead in Cabaret. Right! Seasons greetings, Midway! Tonight, we gather under a blanket of twinkling stars, in front of an elegant evergreen, celebrating the wonder of Christmas... Um... in... in Midway. It's a good thing that we are here at this spectacular tannin. Let's remember that the real gift is the joy we have coming together and celebrating the holiday season. Here, in Midway, we not only cherish Christmas, we embody the values, goodwill, and heart of the holiday season. Tonight's tree lighting is an illumination of all the love in our lives. May this year's Midway festivities bring you cheer and create memories that last a lifetime. Yes! Okay! Three... Two... One! Merry Christmas! Nothing does more for your ego, Craig, than learning how to-- Oh, fancy seeing you here. Look. Got my "Yule Log" stamp. And I met the lone man of the Christmas Council. He showed us how to roast the perfect marshmallow. - Online. - Oh! Would you like me to show you? Let's see. Craig? A stick, please. Thank you, Craig. Okay. Pick your marshmallow. Mm-hmm. Now, the trick is... to find the embers, not the open flame, and you twist. Slowly, evenly, roasting all sides. Oh, you're a real pro at this. So, uh, how many of these did you burn before you got it? How many we burn, Craig? An entire bag. Ah. How do you think Midway compares to San Francisco? Well, I'll say this. I know more about Craig than I do my own neighbors. You don't know your neighbors? We share a wall, not details. We're done. Pull 'em up! - Perfect. - Pretty good. You wanna polish these gourmet marshmallows off while we go look at your beautiful tree? Yeah. All right. Stay warm, Craig. So... do you consider tonight's event a success? People are happy, no blown fuses, and an out-of-towner made new friends. I'd say an overwhelming success. I just hope... Hope what? ...Hope everyone captures the Christmas spirit. Well, I think your speech definitely set the mood. Can you believe that this is my first break tonight? Maybe you should treat yourself more often. Like you? How much writing have you've gotten done since arriving? Hey, life's about balance. Besides, I'm researching. Researching? Right. How does a Christmas tree lighting fit into a mystery story? You really want to know? Yeah. Okay. A jewel thief flees to a small town after... stealing the legendary Christmas Diamond. Our hero has to track him down, but doesn't realize that... the thief has hidden the diamond inside of the town's Christmas tree. Oh. Quite the imagination. I'd like to read this story. Yeah, maybe someday. Want some hot chocolate? - Sure. - Okay, good. People reading my passion projects also makes me wildly uncomfortable. Two hot chocolates, please. Isn't that why you write? To share your dream? Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right. What about you? Are you sharing your dream? Think so. I'm in the process of making Midway a premiere Christmas destination. Well, I think tonight's crowd would agree. Good times all around. Yeah, sometimes, it's hard to let go and enjoy it. You know, it's like a never-ending to-do list. A lot of people depend on me. Hmm. Thank you. Why don't you ask for help? Oh, not in my nature. I hated doing group projects in school. Always ended up having to do all the work by myself. And let the popular kid get all the credit. Yeah. Not sure I'm such a fan of group work myself. Well, hello, you two. Are you having fun? Yeah. I didn't interrupt anything, did I? No! Not at all. Actually, you know what? I better get going. This was really great. Thank you. Um, makes me want to get a Christmas tree. Th-- Oh, really? Well, that's a coincidence. Because Aria's gonna go get a tree for herself tomorrow, aren't ya, honey? Well, you're coming with me. Well, there's the thing, honey, I can't, my back is killing me. Alex, maybe-- Maybe you could go with her. She's gonna need some help. Yeah, sure. I mean, I don't want to impose on tradition. Oh, no, no, no. No. Don't worry about that. You would be doing me a big favor. Dad. Honey, it's a workout and I can help you decorate later. Wait, workout? But you don't need to worry about that because she is deceptively strong. Yeah, sure, of course. I'll pick you up at the diner. - 10:00 a.m.? - 10:00 a.m.? - Mm-hmm. - All right, 10:00 a.m. Good seeing you again. Bye, Mack. Yeah! Bye! Meddling. You can't help yourself. My back is sore. One of those little kids I picked up today must've weighed a hundred pounds. Mm-hmm. I like that young man, honey. I think he's got the makings of a true Mistletoe Man. Are you kidding? You barely even know him. Well, it takes one to know one. Now, I definitely think that boy would climb the highest mountain, he would find the tallest oak tree, to gather mistletoe for his true love. The Mistletoe Man is not about completing physical challenges. He's generous, caring, and open-minded. And believe me, that is not Alex. He is judgmental, opinionated. Worst of all, he thinks that Sterling Masters is just some smiling TV personality. Well, consider it a gut instinct. Why? 'Cause he bought you pie? No. Although the pie helped. I know this is a bad time, but I left my flannel shirt at home. Are we really gonna cut this thing down ourselves? Yeah! That's the fun part. You gotta earn it. Do we, though? Mm-hmm. Oh. So, what's your story? Small-town girl, loving family, owns the local diner. I feel like there's more you're leaving out. What do you want to know? Well, did you always want to take over the diner? Well, Mom believed that everyone should have a home for the holidays. And, well... Midway's my home, I love it. She taught me that home is more of a feeling than a place, and that's why we moved from North Carolina to Utah. Well, Midway is a pretty special town. I think we might have a winner. - What do you think? - What do you think? Good story, or what? - Good story. - All right. Are you sure you don't want to get one of these Paul Bunyans over there to do this? This city guy has no experience with a saw. Well, first time for everything. You take that end, I'll take this one. Where did you grow up? All over. I was a military brat. Really? But I guess where I spent the most time was Jacksonville. Uh-huh? When I was kid, my dream was to see the Northern Lights. I thought that's where Santa lived. My dad was in the Navy, so he traveled everywhere, and he promised me that one day we would spend Christmas in Alaska. Oh. Did you? Nope. Moved to Florida. My dream kind of died. Aw. I read some books about it. The magic was a little bit lost. You should still go. I don't need to find Santa. Maybe not, but maybe you'll find a little magic. Oh, yeah. Maybe. Okay, now, this, this is too much. This is overkill. We should get up here and get a picture. - Oh, yeah? Okay. - Yeah, let's do it. 'Cause your city friends will never believe it. They really won't. Ooh, hoo. Oh, yes, please. Do you mind? Oh, thank you so much. All right. Say "Christmas tree." All right, well, you have earned this flannel, Mr. Paul Bunyan. Thank you. Look at us. Successful group project. I know. You, uh, you should take that tree back and put it in your room. - Really? - Yeah! I'd need to decorate it. Mm. Think I should petition the Christmas Council for a little help. No petition needed. Request granted. All right. Let's hit it. Mm! Thank you very much. I feel like a man now. Um... perfect! I can get my passport stamped. Oh! You are, uh, stepping up your game. - I like a challenge. - Mm. Oh! Hey! I've always wanted one of these. And here I thought you were a real contender. What do you mean? You know, "the Ugly Christmas Sweater" stamp, it can't just be bought, you gotta earn it, too. What, knowing the Christmas Council President doesn't get me any favors? How'd you know I was president? I pay attention. Mm. This one speaks to me as a person. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well, it brings out your eyes. - Thank you. - Yeah. But you should know that the Mistletoe Diner Ugly Christmas Sweater- making party is an honored tradition and I expect to see you there. Oh, I'll be there. With bells on. And tinsel. Garland? No. No garland. Okay. It's fine. "Write from your heart." Make it good. No, let's make it great. - Hi. - Hey! This... is a step up from wine. That is the official Mistletoe Martini. This whole thing is a serious step up. I may be in over my head. Go find a table. I'll send an expert over to help. Yes, ma'am. Okay. I could have helped you with that. No worries. I guessed green was your color. How did you know? Look at this beautiful thing. So what do we do, we just, uh, glue things to it? Don't forget your Bedazzler! I want to see you sparkle. Make it good. We're judging for the contest later. Oh, I'm gonna shine so bright, Rudolph is gonna go blind. Pow! Sorry, I really want this victory. What's gotten into you? Are you always this excited to Bedazzle? Well, not that you'd be interested, but my Christmas wish came true. Sterling Masters is in town. Really? In Midway? Midway was selected for his "Big Holiday Adventure." He just published about it a little while ago. I got an alert. Check this out. "This picturesque mountain town offers more than holiday spirit. In Midway, Christmas is a tangible force. From its sugar cookies to live evergreen forests, it feels like every corner offers a piece of magic you can carry with you." Oh! Live evergreens! He could've been cutting a tree right next to us, and we didn't even know it. He must be good at blending in. I mean, word travels fast in this town and nobody's mentioned anything about a Sterling sighting. You've seen him, haven't you? No. What? I barely know what he looks like. I doubt it. You live in San Francisco, not under a rock. All right, pass the Bedazzler. I'm gonna win this thing. Good luck! - Thank you. So how long does it take to dry? Oh, just a bit. Okay. Wow, your tree is beautiful. Well, I still need to add ornaments. - Let's do it. - Right now? What else are we gonna do? Well, the judging's gonna start. We're on a schedule. Perfect. We'll get extra points for decorating the tree. Come on! Okay. These are from Berlin. How'd you know? Lucky guess. I thought the Rockefeller tree was nice, but this guy... stunning. Mm. You been to the Big Apple for Christmas? Yeah. Wasn't a great experience. No offense to the Rockefeller tree. You weren't mugged, were you? I'm sorry if you were. It's much safer now. Aww, it was more like a ruined Christmas. What kind of a monster ruins Christmas in New York? My ex. I thought he was the Mistle... uh. Ahem. Mis... What? Uh, Mr. Perfect. That we wanted the same things, but he didn't. His dreams were living in Manhattan, Broadway shows, high-rise apartments, 24-hour diners. You didn't want that? Well, my heart's in Midway. This is my home. Well, home is a feeling, not a place, right? Sometimes, they're one and the same. Looking for Sterling? M... Maybe. Hey, everyone! Time for the judging of the sweaters! Oh! Don't you two look adorable? Picture-perfect. I love all the sparkles. We aim to please. What do you say, folks, could these two win for best ugliest sweaters? Aw, thank you. - Congratulations. Well, congrats on your pretty ugly Christmas sweater win. It's a big bucket-list moment for me. But where am I gonna get to wear this exquisite fashion? Well, wear it to the Christmas market on Saturday. Little booths. Crafts. Food. I'll be selling pies. Afterwards, there's dancing at the pavilion. What I mean is, you know, the whole town will be there. And with any luck, Sterling Masters will pay a visit. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Maybe. Hey, save me some sparkle! I'm sorry I'm late, I-- Well, gee whiz, I wasn't gonna win this thing after all, was I? It was fun. I should probably get some more pies. Okay. All right. Hey, Leslie, what's with the, uh, what's with the crowd? Sterling Masters. He posted his first article on Midway today and a charter bus arrived from the ski resort. Can you believe it? Finally! You can be a ghost to Midway, but not to me. So you liked the article? Like it? I love it! "The citizens of Midway offer an unbridled Christmas spirit that can sweeten even the most bitter hearts. Midway has managed to manifest the Capra Christmas into reality, where 'peace on Earth, and goodwill towards all men' is not just an idea, but a way of life." Ha! Are you serious? Midway sounds like a holiday utopia. Yeah, it's got its, uh... its perks. Love the adventure to get a Christmas tree. What are you gonna write about next? Uh, well, there's a Christmas market on Saturday. A market? Like traders and tents? No, more like a... Not so primitive. Like a Christmas festival. Great! That'll be perfect for my book signing. Sorry, what, your book signing? Yeah, a compilation of my articles from the website. My articles. W-Why is this the first I'm hearing about this? Our articles. You know how crazy this business is. An idea pops up, you don't think it's gonna go anywhere... Bam! You have a book published. This will be great for both of us. I'll tell you more about it tomorrow. Tomorrow? You're coming to Midway? Yeah, man. Don't worry, my assistant will set everything up. Now that the article's out, I can be seen. See you tomorrow. Yeah. Oh, absolutely. - Say "Christmas"! - Christmas! It's so nice to meet my fans. Alex! Hey! We don't know each other. Right. Ahem. I'm Sterling. How are you? Good. So tell me about the book. My look? I'm going for "casual mountain man." How do you like the flannel? My stylist says it's "the fabric of America." - That's great. - Mm-hmm. The book. Our book. Oh, yeah. It's a sweet deal. Consider it an early Christmas present. Hello, young man. Hey, Mack. How you doing? I'm fine. Hey. I hear the Christmas tree hunt went rather well. Yeah, yeah. It... Hey, Mack, do you have the sports section? Oh, sure, sure, sure. There you go. Thank you, my friend. Sterling Masters. It's really you! In my diner! I knew in my heart you'd show up. I'm Aria Eubanks. I submitted Midway for the Big Holiday Adventure. Oh, yes, Aria. So nice to meet you. This is my dad. Mack. It is a pleasure to meet you. My daughter is your biggest fan. Your biggest fan! I've read all of your articles. I feel like I've traveled the world with you. Thank you, thank you for being here, your writing, just for everything. I wish I was as good with words as you are. Well, that's my job. To take folks off the beaten path for extraordinary adventures in unique locations. Like Midway. Alex! This is Sterling Masters. Alex is a writer, too. Nice to meet a fellow scribe. Alex is here working on his novel. Is that so? Yeah. You know, I'm promoting my new book at the Christmas market this afternoon. Seriously? We've never had a celebrity book signing! I've just found the people of Midway to be so kind and generous. I thought, what a perfect place to announce my next venture. Shine a real spotlight on this special little town. That is so sweet. Alex, can you believe it? Not a word. Since you brought me here, Aria, I would like you to be my VIP at the book signing. Get to know each other better. She'll be busy. She will be selling her delicious pies. Not all day. I would be honored. Since you and Alex are both writers, maybe you can give Alex some tips. That's not necessary. I would love to. We can hang out at the market. Talk shop. Great. Yeah. I'm so glad we can speak freely. It felt like we were spies on a secret mission. Do you think I'd make a good spy? No. About that book deal... Hi. Can I have a stamp, please? You got the contract, right? Pretty sweet payday. Please. Thank you. Yes, it's a sweet payday. Listen, I'm thinking about taking a break. Break? Like Christmas break? No, not Christmas break. More like time off to write my novel. Whoa, you're actually writing a novel? I've told you this for so very many years. I mean, everyone says that, but no one actually does it. Well, I'm doing it. Just because I lost my book deal doesn't mean I stopped writing the thing. You just never talked about it. Yeah, because I'm too busy writing as Sterling Masters. Listen, I love you, man, but I think now is the right time for me to take a step back and start writing for myself... full-time. You can't do that now. The book's set to be a best-seller. Under your name. Not mine. Yeah, but we know the truth. Huh? We're a team. Listen. Sometimes... you just gotta do things your own way. We're partners. I wouldn't be standing here without you. Okay. Well, get me a meeting with your publisher. Let's just concentrate on work for now. There are still two more articles to go. Midway deserves the spotlight. There you go. Thank you. Enjoy the holiday season. Oh, and check out my website and make sure to tweet, snap, share, and 'Gram it. I love you, Midway. That went so well. You enjoyed it. Come on. People love your writing. Hmm? Hmm? Yeah. Maybe. So... Aria... what's her story? What do you mean? I mean, you two seem to know each other. Well, I mean... hardly. Really? She introduced you to me. She's just that kind of a friendly person. What else do you know about her? Well, she's, uh, genuine, the real deal. Humble. Incredibly generous. And warm, like sunshine on a winter's day. I agree. She seems really great. Hey, guys. Saved you a pie. - You made this? - Mm-hmm. How generous. I almost lost an arm wrestling it back from Catherine. This is Leslie. She owns the Sugarplum Lodge. Thanks to you, we're booked through New Year's, but I always keep the Presidential Suite open for special guests. Oh, that sounds great. Yeah, it does. It's a shame, because he's staying in a cabin way outside of town. I am? I am. So what kind of pie did Leslie wrestle Catherine for? Um, actually, it's the pie that put the Mistletoe Diner on the map, Mistletoe Man Meringue. It's my mother's special recipe. Smells wonderful... like Christmas in a box. You know, as president of the Christmas Council, Aria can give you a private tour of all the Christmas activities. Well, I don't want to interrupt your writing process. Midway is a small town, but we still have our hidden gems. Right, Aria? I have no doubt about that. Well, before Sterling can go anywhere, he promised to read a few chapters of my book. That is so wonderful. Well, I'll let you guys get back to work. I hope we run into each other again soon. Me too. Um, before we go, can I just-- - Yeah. - Okay. Oh... ho, ho, ho, ho. This might be my new Christmas card, profile picture, and wallpaper. Bye. Thank you again. Do you think I should have-- No, just stay right here. Hey, Aria. Hey! Looks like you have a mentor. I wouldn't go that far. I was wondering, uh, is that dance still happening? Y-Yeah. At the pavilion. But aren't you working with Sterling? No. Not all night. I'll stop by. Great. I'll see you there. Okay. See you there. This is where you're staying? Yeah. So, your assistant arranged a car to take you to the airport. Don't want you to miss any more production meetings. This reminds me of Switzerland. Yeah, it's great. There's a fireplace, perfect for you to practice your Swiss-German while you wait. Do you think I should stay? Hang out more in Midway? No... No, you're fine. You've popped in. It's great. Back to business as usual, all right? Where are you going? To write. I got a deadline. It was good seeing you, man. Danke schön, Merry Christmas, and, uh... I'll call you about the publisher meeting. Okay. Do you have any rooms available? What's melting your snowflakes? Nothing. Come on. You can't fool me. You practically asked Sterling out for me. Unsolicited, by the way. I say this with love, but you'll never find your Mistletoe Man sitting on the sidelines. I appreciate your faith in me. Hello. A little Christmas romance is good for the soul. Well, my heart doesn't appreciate the uncertainty. Come on. Anything can happen at Christmas. Hey, Alex. You look nice. Thank you. How did things go with Sterling? Good, yeah, he's reading the chapters tonight. Do I get, uh, a stamp? Of course. - Thank you very much. I haven't been to a dance since prom. I don't know if this is how it's still done, but, uh... may I have this dance? Don't step on me. You understand that Midway truly makes people feel at home for Christmas, and that's thanks to you. And Sterling. Look at this crowd. It's double from last year. And more importantly, he's helping you with your novel. You missed your Christmas cruise for it. What's important to you? What's your Christmas wish? Christmas is back in Midway. That's all I wanted. - Oh, come on, that can't be all. You deserve something. Special. Just for you. Because you've been such a good friend, you know? At first, I thought your honesty was annoying, but I actually admire it. Thank you. Real friends are truthful. Aria, there's something I should, uh... I should tell you. What? I am... Sterling? What? How? Hello again. What are you doing here? I thought you were... Reading your chapters? Riveting. I think you have a real future. My publisher would be very interested. I also finished a good portion of that pie. Delicious! I had to come thank you in person. You really are like sunshine on a winter's day. Greetings! I'd recognize that dazzling smile anywhere. Welcome to Midway, Sterling Masters. Thank you. We're honored to have you. Oh. I have a special VIP table. Please join us. This is our Christmas Council. So nice to meet everyone. I would love to hear more from the Council, but... not without its president. Aria? Lead the way. Alex, what about you? Join us? No, I'm okay. I'll catch up with you guys. We were all so impressed with your exquisite review of our little town. You didn't mention Santa's Scavenger Hunt or Chestnut Canyon. What? I worked hard on the hunt. Well, it's one of three articles. Christmas is still a week away. Put them on my list. Anywhere else? I'll definitely check out that live Christmas tree farm. "If Winter Wonderland were a real place." Uh, you called it that in your last article. Right! Sorry, it's been a long day. Where should I go next? Mrs. Claus's Tea Room, the Christmas Cocoa Party... The holiday hike. Santa's village. We take Christmas seriously here. Now, I do have a question, and be honest. Okay. I know we don't have the lavish landmarks like they do in the big cities, but how do you think we compare so far? There is no comparison. That's what's so special about Christmas. It makes every city beautiful. There you are. I could have used you in there. Wingman-- Not in my contract. Wingman? I needed a lifeline. I was bombarded by the Christmas Council. Why'd you stay? Well, the Sugarplum Lodge offered me the Presidential Suite. How could I refuse? This was not part of the plan. We are trying something different. It could be fun. Think positive. It's Aria, isn't it? I really feel a connection with her. She gets me. Please. I'm serious! She speaks to me with so much passion. It's like... my work really means something to her. My work. She watches the show, too. Help me get to know her better. What's the big deal? It feels wrong. I don't want to lie to her any more than we have. The ghostwriter thing? We won't bring it up. Look, I'm not asking you to be a matchmaker. We'll all hang out around town and I'll call my publisher right now. Well, not right now-- Tomorrow, definitely. And you can have time off to finish your book. I'll even write the foreword. You write it. I'll sign it. Then it's a deal. This is gonna be great. Alex! Holiday cheer. Welcome to my merrymaking tea room. Oh, thank you, Catherine. Oh, my dear, you have been confused. I'm Mrs. Claus. Right, of course. My mistake. Mrs. Claus. Do you sleep ever? When Mrs. Claus wants pie, you gotta deliver. Yeah, you wouldn't want to end up on her husband's naughty list. I didn't picture you as the tea party type. This is my first one. So what do you recommend? The "holiday blend" or "candy cane"? Definitely holiday blend. Cinnamon is my all-time favorite. Goes best with the Mistletoe Man Meringue. Okay. Hey. How great is this? I love tea. Where are we sitting? Um, I wasn't going to stay, actually. I have to get back to the diner. You give yourself a lunch break, right? Stay, just one cup. Okay. Let me call the diner. Gentlemen. What a delight, to host such honorable guests. So, which of the North Pole's specialty brews may Mrs. Claus fetch for this dashing duo? Hmm. I do love peppermint. - Mm. I'll have two of those, and Mistletoe pie all around. You don't think she'll mind if I order for her, do you? Alex? I'll have the holiday blend, extra cinnamon. Good choice. Thank you, Mrs. Claus. Aw, I really wish I didn't have to do this, but who knows what you'd say if I left you alone. Relax, it's just tea. Hi. I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of ordering for you. Oh. Oh! I hope these poinsettias aren't real. Alex is allergic. To the sap, not the flower. Don't break a leaf, I'll be fine. Details. How did you know he had an allergy? A fan gave Sterling one when we were discussing my book. Exactly! Alex gave me the whole story. How he almost ended up at the E.R. Tea and pie for everybody! Thank goodness! Thank you. There you go, sir. Ahh. In Japan, this is known as bakha-cha. In Korea. It's where I had my first tea ceremony. At Christmas, they host the Boseong light festival at the tea plantations. I'll put it on my bucket list. Mm, very minty... Thank you. Okay, dashers. The object of this year's scavenger hunt is to find all three pieces of a snowman. Pieces are hidden throughout Santa's village and surrounding areas. Your clues are on this piece of paper. First team to build their snowman and finish the hunt wins the prize. So, partner up and Christmas Luck! Yes, of course. Let's do this. Oh... over here. Okay. Okay, they're leaving. Here we go. "Santa was quick, his face you did not see, but he left a piece under the..." "Under the Christmas Tree!" The tree! Okay, okay. - Ha-ha! - All right! - Next clue. - Okay. "During the Christmas season, carols are sung, find your last piece where stockings are hung." This way! Ha! Ooh... Ahh! Ooh! Got it! Oh, here! Yes! Ah, boom! This reminds me of the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona. Oh! How did you avoid not getting trampled on? We survived using our instincts. Oh. Some of our highest ratings ever. You okay? - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. Up here, up here... Right over there! Yeah! Ah! Congrats, Dashers! You win dessert at Kringle's! Maybe next year. Yeah. Maybe next year. I knew I picked the best partner. Victory. That's great. Rub it in. I thought the Tivoli Gardens were charming at Christmas, but this is something else. Right, Alex? Remember Copenhagen? You mean, like I wrote in my novel? Yeah, I'm glad it was so vivid for you. Right. You were never there. It was an accurate description, though. - Thank you. - Hey, Sterling. Would you mind taking a picture with our staff? They're huge fans. Yeah. - Congrats. - Thanks. That was fun. Is the scavenger hunt every year? It's one of the original Midway attractions. My mom and I were dash partners. Yeah. A lot of good memories. I love these events. You should take more time for the things that you love. I know, but it just... it feels so selfish. But you can't give what you don't have. It's important to refill the tank now and again with things that make you happy. I'll think on that. - Okay, I'll take that. - Okay. Aw! - Howdy. - Hey. How's my favorite writer? About to submit the next article. Should I read it first? Have you ever? Mm! I'm gonna need five holiday hikes to walk off all this pie. All right, let's take a photo for the website and the social media. For Aria. And again. Yeah, there you go. Do your thing. There you go. Perfect. That's a lot of filters, man. What's this? Oh, it's my Midway Christmas passport. Helps me keep track of my progress. You want one? Mm-mm. I can barely keep up with my real passport. Is there anything to do after 9:00 around here? Like, Karaoke? Bowling? I'm getting a little stir-crazy. Sometimes, it's nice to slow down. Just relax, be yourself. What happened to the guy who wanted to go to Tokyo for Christmas? I guess I'm finding the value in small towns. For a while, writing was getting routine, but here, I feel, uh... revitalized. - "Revitalized..." I like that. You should use it. Yeah. I guess I'll work, too. I've got production notes for a new special-- "Journey to the Nile." TV gets all the good quests. Some stories are just too big for the Internet. Thanks for these articles. I couldn't go on these quests without you. Well... you two have become fast friends. Yeah, yeah. It's funny how that happens. Say, did I ever tell you why my wife named this "the Mistletoe Diner"? That was for you, right? Well, sort of, yeah. No, see, she, um, she liked to tell this old folk story about a beautiful princess, who was so enchanting that every eligible bachelor wanted to marry her, but she was torn between a prince and knight. She wasn't sure which one really loved her. So, she sought the advice of a wise old sage, who told her whoever could bring her the magic mistletoe would be her true love. The magic mistletoe? Oh, it's very special mistletoe. Very special, you see. Took an act of devotion to even reach it. See, the sage explained that, if a man was willing to risk everything to gather this mistletoe for her, then he truly loved her. So who got the mistletoe? The one who believed in the magic. Please tell me it was the knight. Come Christmas Day, maybe you can tell me. I gotta go. Hey, buddy... still looking good. Hey, Alex. Hi. What about this crowd, huh? Yeah. Sterling--he released another one of those articles and he had a picture on it-- It was him eating a piece of pie. It's making an impact? Absolutely! Here. Ask Aria. Honey? Alex! Hey! Look at this turnout. Did you hear the good news? "Nothing epitomizes Christmas like the delectable pies of the Mistletoe Diner-- A special treat that can revitalize the Christmas spirit in the most cantankerous Scrooge." And, look, there's even a picture to go along with it. I had to hire extra help just to keep up with demand. Just a little early Christmas present. I'm happy to help. The important thing is the continued success of Midway and the Mistletoe Diner. Congratulations, Aria. Thank you. Bidding closes in five minutes! Remember, all proceeds benefit Midway's parks and rec center. These sensational ornaments need a home for the holiday. Come on! So, you, uh... you might want to get in there. There could be some magic to be found. You know? Right. Find anything special? Yep. Do you even have a tree? I do, actually. I just wanted a little keepsake from Midway. Mm. Good thinking on the pictures. Very effective. Yeah. Just doing my job. I submitted the final article tonight. It's only the 22nd. I know. You have until Christmas Eve. I know. I added a little holiday folklore that I hope will make Christmas day special... you know, for the readers. Hmm. And now, for the final winner of the evening... So did you make the winning bid? I think so. Yeah. Oh, my. We have a true Santa Claus in the crowd. For the beautiful crystal mistletoe ornament, the winning bid goes for $1,000! It's a worthy cause. I had a feeling it was you. Perfect keepsake to remind me of Midway and the charming Mistletoe Diner. You've done so much for Midway. It's nothing. I haven't been this excited about an ornament since I found the Christmas pickle at a Christmas market in Berlin. A German tradition. The first to find it on the tree is assured good luck. But I have a feeling this one is much more special. I'm sure you find something special in every city. Let's just say Midway is a standout. Thanks to you, Aria. I'm surprised that Alex didn't bid. Have you seen him? Nope. Well... no wonder you haven't returned my phone calls. I've been baking since dawn. Whew! Honey, th-there's something that I've noticed about Sterling. Oh, I know! He's the Mistletoe Man. Huh? Sterling? Yeah! "Christmas is full of folklore and traditions, but in Midway, none compare to the enchantment of the Mistletoe Man and his devotion to win the heart of a fair princess-- A knight in shining armor who must embark on a quest, climbing the highest peak to find a magical mistletoe. Such a tale is not without competition from an arrogant prince, but the knight's heart is true. In the end, it is his belief in magic that finds the mistletoe and a kiss that lasts a lifetime." Ohh! It's just like what Mom used to talk about. I can't believe he knew the story! Well, honey, I actually-- Dad, Sterling, he bought the mistletoe ornament. I don't know. I think it's fate. Well, I'm not sure that-- You always tell me to let my guard down and take a chance, and I'm finally doing it. Sterling and I, we're having dinner tonight at Kringle's. Kringle's? - Mm-hmm! Well, that's where I proposed to your mama. I know. Oh! Well, have you considered, honey, that-- I have to go get ready. Wish me luck. I don't know, maybe I'll find a little magic this Christmas. This is nice. Just the two of us, finally. It is. I keep looking over my shoulder, thinking the Christmas Council is going to appear. You're like the star on top of the Christmas tree. Everyone looks up to you. That's a real honor. I love how you find a greater meaning behind everything. Value in the tiniest details. You know, I had this larger-than-life image of you in my head. I didn't know what to expect. People can be different in person. I hope I'm better. I thought you were just being nice when you bought the mistletoe ornament... but now I know it's more. Meeting you has been the best part of this trip. You see me for more than just my... celebrity. I'm so glad I stayed. You were leaving? Yeah, I had a flight booked the day of the market. Hmm. What about your articles? You had only published one by then. I did extensive research before I met you. I had everything I needed to write about Midway. Anything else? Um, no, I think we're good. Wonderful. I can stamp your Christmas passports. I... don't have one. Maybe next time. No Christmas passport? Mm-mm. So, uh... how did you know about the Mistletoe Man story? Man? I thought it was a pie. You wrote about it. Oh, right. Um... Alex told me. Alex? Mm-hmm. Oh... I can't believe I didn't realize it. It was him the whole time. Show business is complicated. I think, once you hear me out, you'll see how funny it really is. Alex is my best friend and ghostwriter. He practically runs the website. It's very common in this industry. And when I read his review for Midway, well, I had to come see it for myself. My agent thought it'd be a great place to promote my new book. A compilation of your travel articles... Mm-hmm. Alex's articles. But meeting you changed everything. I felt a connection, too. And Alex and I made an agreement, that he would help me get to know you better, and I would help get him a meeting with my publisher. For his novel. So... A charade and an agreement? No... wow, that sounds bad. Forget everything I said. Believe me, everyone had the best intentions. Finding the magic and the mistletoe... You knew nothing about that? I wish I did. I think it would really help right now. This is just a simple misunderstanding. I'm still the same Sterling. You get it, right? That's exactly why I have to go. Merry Christmas, Sterling. Thank you for dinner, but I need to go find Alex. Alex. Aria. I thought you were out with Sterling. I was and he told me everything. Okay. Uh... I'm so sorry. I can explain. Everything I told you, all the times we were together, and you just let me carry on like a fool. And for what? I thought we were friends. We are. I-It's complicated. I didn't have a choice. No. You had a choice and you made it. You just wanted a book published. Look, Aria, please. No, no, no, I'm sorry. I-I just can't trust you. Mm-mm-mm. I heard you were checking out. The road is my life... and I thought I'd surprise my parents. Come home on Christmas Eve for once. Crazy as it sounds, hanging out in Midway's made me a little homesick. You and Aria? We weren't meant to be. But I think I know who might be. I really screwed it up for you, didn't I? Only as soon as you got here. You gonna give up? Last night, Aria mentioned this mistletoe story. Since she abandoned me at the restaurant, I had time to read it. What'd you think? You're the Mistletoe Man. The last article is practically a love letter to her and Midway. That's why you bid on the ornament. Yeah, I didn't expect you to double it. I was just trying to show off. If I had known, I would've backed off. I had a plan to tell her Christmas Day. After the articles and, cross my fingers, you were gone. Tonight is Christmas Eve. You still have time. She won't return my calls. Well, use the website. Your website? This Christmas... write your story, with your name. What about the contract? Legally, I can't. Leave that to me. I'll have the website updated with your name. It's time to give credit where credit's due. Besides... we make a great team. Partner? Yeah. Yeah. Partner. Well, I have a plane to catch and you have some writing to do. Sterling? Yeah? Thanks, buddy. Thank you. Yeah, all right. Hmm? Just-- let's get it over with. Merry Christmas, Alex. Yeah, Merry Christmas, you giant. There's one more favor I need to ask you, actually. Okay. I thought you'd be on your way back to the big city. I've grown an appreciation for small towns. Would you care to take a seat? Mm-mm. Okay. I tried calling. It's been busy. Call it the Sterling Masters spike. I want to explain-- It's not necessary. I understand why you did it. Your career, the book. It's the most important thing to you. No, no. No. Not anymore. You. This-This-This... place. Midway, it's changed me. That's nice, but you were always going back to your big city. I've seen it before. And, let's be honest, this was all just one Big Holiday Adventure. Aria, I've been to every big city in the world and none of them have inspired me like Midway. I've been searching my whole life for a special place that felt like home, but after meeting you, I've realized that it's not the place, it's the... it's the people. It's hard to believe you. I had plan to tell you. Sterling, he is my best friend, he is my business partner. It's complicated. Do you see how complicated this was? "Complicated." The key word. Okay, you're not gonna sit, I'm gonna stand. My flight, it leaves tonight, Christmas Eve, but I'll stay... if that's what you want. - And then what? Christmas is over and you leave. I have my life here and you have yours. We just want different things. Now I need to get back to mine. Merry Christmas, Alex. Wait, uh... Read the website. Honey? Huh? Penny for your thoughts. Oh, it's nothing. Really? Alex came by today. And? Well... he said that he had never really felt at home until he came to Midway, and until he met me. Oh, that. I mean, I knew that. Everybody knows that! - What? - Oh, uh... "I was struck by Aria Eubanks, dynamic Christmas Council president and owner of the Mistletoe diner-- The personification of Christmas. Generous, joyous, pure of heart. Her dedication to Midway is endearing. Her enthusiasm, contagious. Like witnessing the Northern Lights dance across a midnight sky, you can't help but be mesmerized." Aww... I ruined it. Oh, come on, now. Come on. O-Open that box. You always feel better when you open a present. Aww. Well... Now, he is obviously smitten by you. So why don't you run on over to the Sugarplum Lodge and see him? Are you gonna say "I told you so"? I wouldn't dream of it. So what are you gonna do? I have an idea. But I'm gonna need some help and a little Christmas magic. We can do that. Leslie. Checking out. Sure you don't want to stay? It's Christmas Eve. No. No, no real reason to stay. Did you collect all your passport stamps? Kringle's stamped last night with, uh, takeout. I'm missing... Chestnut Canyon. Alex! Oh, I'm so glad I caught you. I was so deeply moved by your article. I had no idea that you wrote so passionately! You could write for the theater. Well, if I ever become a playwright, you will be my first lead actress. Oh! Okay. Um... My keys. Have you-- Have you guys seen my keys? Oh, what do they look like? Car keys. I, uh... I gotta return my rental. I just had them here. Oh, we have a complimentary car service to the airport. The keys have to be close by. We'll take care of it. My rental car? In Utah, we're very friendly. Don't worry about it. - Leslie will take care of it. - We do this all the time. Okay. Wh-Where's the car service? The driver is outside. Yeah! Sure. Thank you. Uh, nice meeting you, Leslie. - I swear that I had the-- - I know, I know. Come on! Things get lost. You have a great trip now. Bye-bye. Thank you so much. Craig? Hey, buddy. It's Christmas Eve, Craig. Aren't you supposed to be with your family? In Midway, we're all family. You needed a lift, I'm here for ya. Okay. Thank you. Sure gonna miss you. I'm glad someone will. Oh, come on. We all will. You'll always have a home in Midway. Did you go to Chestnut Canyon? The lookout is gorgeous. No. That was the one passport stamp I missed. What? You can't leave town without seeing it. I worked really hard on it. I'm not sure if there's time, Craig. I've got a plane to catch. Craig, it's fine. No. You have to see it. My plane leaves in, uh... Go on! Take a look. I'm pretty sure your family might wanna see you tonight, Craig. - Get your passport stamped. - Okay, I'm gonna get the stamp. Aria? Need a stamp for your passport? Did you do all this? With some help. All this time, I was falling for you. Your writing opened my mind... but being with you opened my heart. You're worth the risk. I'm certain of it. Please, stay. At least till Christmas? I thought I'd find the best place to celebrate Christmas... I found something better. What's that? You. I'm so sorry. I should've told you the truth from the beginning. The moment I saw you... I knew you're the kinda girl you keep close forever. This passport really kinda works. It brought me home. To a feeling or a place? Both. Wow. Anything is possible at Christmas. So... who ended up with the magic? Was it the prince or the knight? Thankfully, the knight. All right, all right! Between us mistletoe men, okay? Mm-hmm. I guess mistletoe magic is real. Yes, it is. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Oh! Merry Christmas, everyone! Merry Christmas!
