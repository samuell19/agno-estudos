I know I don't. ♪ It don't matter who you are ♪ Anyone can be a star ♪ Brighter than the lightning ♪ You go as far as you go. Well, I'm a dancer by nature. I've been studying for four years, and now I teach. But I'd like you to know, I'm very available for TV work. No. Good day. And acting roles, I could do that. I do dramatic-type parts. I could do comedy type of roles... I'd certainly consider doing a soap opera. Or even perhaps a road show, a musical of some sort. And, uh, I would definitely consider doing a print ad. And if you're lookin' for the strong, natural outdoor type... I'm very good at some sports, like weight lifting, a-and stickball... And push-ups, and... And if... And if absolutely necessary, I don't mind doing any kind of, uh, extra work, except for nudity. My... I promised my mother I'd never do any nudity. I guess she's afraid that I might get a cold or something, huh? But the fact still is, I'm a dancer by nature. Whatever. Yeah, whatever. I don't know, Jackie. It's like you're invisible. They don't even see ya. I mean, they definitely make you feel like you're wasting your time. And what's really weird is that they all sound like my father used to, to me. Why do you keep getting so down on yourself? You know what you can do. Well, what about you? What about me? You have been in and out of choruses for six years now, doing everything everybody else is doing. Don't you ever get the urge to do something that's all you? Look, if it happens, good. If it doesn't, it's not gonna bother me. How could you think that way? You know a woman's career as a dancer is half as long as a man's. So that means I have half as many chances as you do of making it. Right? I've gotta be real with myself. I don't know. I guess so. Mm. Cherry. Hey. Will you come tonight? See you later. Huh? Tonight's supposed to be the last show. I don't think I can make it. Why do you keep making all these excuses? What excuses? Come on, Tony. Don't play this competition thing with me. Oh, competition. Just because you're in a show and I'm not. That's a competition thing. Yeah. Well, what is it? That ain't competition. Envy. Will you be there? Got any messages? It's an inside joke. Bravo! Bravo! Tony! Hey, Jackie. How'd you like it? Are you sure? Aw, you were great! You're not just saying that? No, no, I'm positive. You was fantastic out there. Really. I was so nervous knowing you were out here. Oh, don't. You shouldn't have been, really. You shouldn't have been. Oh, are you sure I was okay? You were great. Really. Look, I'm gonna go change. Are you gonna hang around? Yeah, I'll be here. All right. I'll meet you outside, okay? Sure, why not? Why not? Good. Good. Okay. Hi. Yes? I wanted to tell you that you're an incredible dancer. Thank you very much. I'm a friend of Jackie Coll's. I-I'm Tony Manero. It's important to have friends. Yeah, I was just sayin' that this morning over breakfast. Did you want something? An autograph or something? I-I'd like to get together with you and maybe talk some time. Might that be possible? About what? About how incredible you are. Thank you. But I do already know that. Say what? Mm, I already know. Well, in case you don't know this, I used to be pretty incredible myself when I lived in Brooklyn. Really? What happened? I moved to Manhattan. So where exactly are you imported from? The vicinity of England? Mm-hmm. Very good. See, I know. So, what do you do? I-I'm sort of into telling the future now. Hmm? Like I can tell great things are gonna happen for you. Oh, really? What great things? You're gonna meet this guy, right? This really... Really sensitive, nice type of guy. I mean, great guy. And once you get to know him and his personality, I think you're going to be crazy about him. I am? So where is he? Yeah! I'll go get him. All right? You just wait here. You'll love him. He's great. Really. Really. Hey, Rico! Yeah. No, no, she's here. She's waitin' to see you. Really. Come on, she's great! Really, no. I'll get him. I got her here. She's nice! No problem. No, no, no, she's great. You'll love her. Come on! Wait. No, come on! Come on. Okay. Didn't happen. Imported, indeed. How are ya doin'? Strong draft in there, huh? Come in. What did you do that for? You nearly broke my face with this door. I didn't even give you my best come-ons, and you try to mangle my face. Well, Jimmy, you see... Tony. Whatever. You seem to take pleasure in treating women as though we're incredibly stupid. Look, if you're mad at me, I apologize for that, all right? I thought I was being sort of charming. Even though you did try to damage my head. But look, the thing is, is that I-I amazingly respect your dancing talent. And I respect your womanhood. I didn't always respect womanhood, but since I moved into Manhattan, I got this... This new, mature outlook on life. I don't smoke, I don't drink. I don't curse... Anyway, look, if you're still interested, I would like to take you out. I'd... Maybe we could go someplace, relax, have a drink. Maybe have some dinner. And, uh... We gotta go someplace informal, 'cause my suits are all bein' pressed. Okay. Thank you for the invitation. But I'm afraid I have to go home early tonight. You see, we're auditioning for the new show. Are you in that new show? Mm-hmm. Definitely. Are you a dancer? Yeah, couldn't you tell? Oh, of course. Why don't you come by tomorrow? They need about 30 dancers, and I could put in a good word. No, don't do that. Please. I really don't need any help in that department. Okay. Are you sure you can't go out tonight? Sorry. Yeah. Well, if I don't see you anymore, nice meeting you, and nice being insulted by you. My pleasure. Aren't you coming tomorrow? I knew you wanted to see me again. Taxi! You want to eat, or what? Oh, I got to get to the club. How do you work at that club? That club is like a health hazard. Extra money. Did you know they was gonna have an audition tomorrow? I told you that a week ago! Really? Yeah. Maybe I wasn't paying attention. You're gonna audition? Why not? Rejection's become like a hobby to me now. Oh, listen to you. Small world, isn't it? Good night. Good night. Good night. Small world? Do you know her? Just informally. Well, how'd you meet her? She was passin' by before. I told her she was an okay dancer. That's incredible. You tell her she's an "okay dancer." Or something to that effect. She a great dancer. I can't believe you said that. What about the limo? Whose is it? I think it belongs to her. Everybody says that she comes from money. Really? This what's-her-name. Is she, like, heavily involved with someone, or what? I don't know. What do you mean by "involved"? You know, has she got a lot of guys hangin' around, droolin' over her, you know? Look, if you're hot over somebody, I don't want to always hear about it. I just respect her dancin', that's all! Yeah. Did you hear the way she talks? It's so intelligent-like. I love it. An accent doesn't make someone intelligent. If it did, you'd be Einstein. Aw, come on, Jackie. I'm not tryin' to make you jealous. I think you're a good dancer. Aw, come on. What can I say to you? Don't play these games, Tony. What games? I'll see you tomorrow. We... Well, come on. I don't even know her! Y-you sure don't want something to eat? Oh, Manero, you really got a way with words, don't you? ♪ Very good. Excellent. Just in case you gotta hear it again, it's whoever's right for the show. Michelle. Tracy. Smitty. I'm sorry... Karen, yes. Sorry. Jackie, you work real hard. Yes. Okay, that's it. Next group. Okay. Men, please! I'm going to watch this from the orchestra. Hi, I'm Joy. I'm happiness. I bet you are. I'm the assistant choreographer. If there's any questions regarding the routine, please ask me now. Listen up, 'cause this time I want to try something different. I want you to do the whole combination, right to the end. I just wanted to tell you, if I don't see you again, you got beautiful legs. And I want you to improvise. So do you. Listen up! If you finish dancing, move off stage! You're always causin' trouble. Now, get outta here. Okay, now get ready. Joy, count it down. Okay, music! That's... That's good. That's enough. Thank you. We need pictures and resumes on you, and a phone number. We'll get back to you in 24 hours. You were all excellent. But I only need two. Thank you. Hello, Jimmy. It's Tony. Oh, whatever. I know what you must be thinking. Do you? Mm. They'll call. Don't worry. Whatever. You were very good down there. Oh, thank you. I mean it. Really? Yeah. Sounds like you really appreciated me. Yes. You could say that. Well, could I ask you something? What? Well, if, uh, if you appreciate me and I appreciate you, how about let's gettin' together and we could appreciate each other? Appreciate? Yeah, like for many hours. Well, I do have this singing lesson I'll have to cancel. Ah, that's all right. I got a dance class I'd have to cancel. And then I have to cancel my manicure. Well, I have to cancel my meeting with the mayor. And then, I'd have to cancel my... yoga class. That's all right. I'd have to cancel my brain operation.

Well, I think it's about time we said good night. What's wrong? Nothing! It's just, um, you know, 3:00, and I've got to work on rehearsals tomorrow. Wait a minute! Are you serious? Yeah. Yeah.

Tony? Where are you? I'm patrolling the city. I'm making sure the streets are safe for women and children. Somebody's gotta do it. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm doin' great. Are you alone? What?

Would you like to come up for a drink? I gotta be goin'. Well, all right. I'll see you at rehearsals, then. Mm-hmm. And, um, get out of the cold before you crack. Nice meeting you. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four. That's it. Relax! What we're having here is a conceptual interpretation problem.

So don't waste my time going through the motions of emotions. You gotta feel what the hell you're doing here. For those who forgot, the show's called "Satan's Alley." It's a journey through hell.

Um, I-I gotta get going. I'll give you a call later, all right? I'll call you later. All right? Okay. You know, if you're really a friend of hers, you should do her a favor. What's that? Teach her to dance. There ain't nothing wrong with her dancin'. Oh, I really like her too. It's just that, uh, she's ordinary. But you, you're very good. Where are you comin' from? Why? Is something wrong? I don't like bein' led on. Who's leading you on? I call you up, you're not home. I go to your apartment, you're not there. And then I wait all night for you and you bring some guy home with ya. Are you talking to me? What we did, it don't mean nothin' to you? It was nice. Oh, nice! Somethin' like you do every day? Like havin' breakfast? I usually skip breakfast. Look. I'll see you later. Where are ya goin'? I'm talkin' to you. I said, later. Come here, I wanna... Take your bloody hands off me! Don't you ever touch me again. Who do you think you're dealing with? Some little groupie that jumps when you call? Is that who you think I am? We met. I liked you. We made it. What do you think it was, true love? And you think I used you. What about you using me? Everybody uses everybody. Don't they? ♪ Ah ♪ Love, lover ♪ Lover, lover, lover. Hold it. Hold it. What's this? I thought we decided to go downstage. That's true, but then I changed it to the upstage position. Well, it was better going downstage. Was it? Much better. I'll tell you what's even better. You learn the goddamn routine the way I laid it out. Again. And five, six, seven, eight... What if I come over about 9 tonight, would that be all right? How do I know you're gonna show? Oh, come on, Jackie. Are you sure you're gonna be there? Definitely be there. We'll go out. What, Christmas caroling? How did you know? How'd you know? All right, all right. I'll see you later. Don't go talkin' to strangers, now. Tony, nobody's stranger than you are. See ya. Tony! Oh, listen, I'm having a few friends 'round tonight. A kind of pre-Christmas party. Would you like to come? Didn't we just have a fight? Wasn't that you? Look, we didn't have a fight, Tony, you did. But, uh, I hope that's all resolved now. And I'd like to see you again. What time? Oh, tennish.

Well, what do you want me to do? What do you want, stretch it? No, I was just makin' an observation, that's all. Tony, why did you come here today? I don't know. I got a lot of things on my mind. Like what? What things? I don't know. The way I used to act around here. The way I treated everybody. I was very hard on you. I just... I just wanted to say, it's not me, all right? That wasn't me. What, are you kidding me? No, I'm apologizing to you. Apologizing for what? What are you saying? That that wasn't the real you back then? Yeah. Ma, look. I had a lot of attitude, and I... I just didn't like it. And I d... I don't believe this. Believe it. Oh, well, I don't believe it. And don't get fresh with me. This... This attitude... you're talking about. That's what got you out of this damn neighborhood. So don't go apol... You don't need to apologize, because you must have been doing something right. So what you're sayin' is, I've always been this bastard, but it's all right, 'cause, like, it comes natural to me? Yeah, something like that, yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Double yeah. I'll have another piece of this pie. It's very good. Better than the stuff I get in New York. You know, I bought you a ticket for the show. Twenty-six bucks. Oh. I'm a hotshot now. ♪ Dance ♪ Lay back, Butler. Extend. Extend! ♪ Dance. Enough. Enough. Maybe it's me, Butler. Maybe I'm not getting across what I want. You're still ticklish, huh? What I want is a much more... forceful type movement. See, it's a very sensual show, Butler. Right. So let's try to be sensual. Try it. You might like it. Once again. What do you think? She's good. What about him? He's good but he's too mechanical. ♪ Fire ♪ Dance. What are you doin' later? I've got commitments. You do? Yeah, I do. No, you don't. What, you don't think I have other plans? No. Well, you're wrong. I can tell when you're lyin'. How? How can you tell when I'm lyin'? With who? Who's your "commitment" with? I'll never tell. I'll go out with ya. Excuse me? The three of us.

I need to ask you somethin'. That guy's a musician. Yeah. I-I didn't think you was the musician type. I-I never thought that. You know he plays rhythm guitar at the club. He walked me over here. He plays rhythm guitar? Oh, man, that's the worst. That's the absolute worst. Man, everybody in the world knows you can't trust a guy who plays a rhythm guitar. Oh, I can't believe... Look, underneath them curls is a pervert. I can feel it. Did you take funny pills today or something? Oh, forget it. How did you get in here? The window. Look, I don't like him. You amaze me. I wouldn't trust him. It looks like some demented paratrooper. He is just a friend. Hey, listen, thanks, Carl. So is everything all right? Everythin' is fine. She's in good hands. Hey, what are you, allstate, pal? Yeah. You want disability? Look, I'll see you Wednesday, okay? All right. Good night. Good night. See ya. I can't believe it!

Hey, Jackie, wait a minute. Uh... I wanna say... I wanna say somethin' to you, but it's... It's... It's really hard, because... I'm just not used to sayin' nice things to you, that's all. Uh... Uh, I think we had somethin' really comfortable, right? Somethin' really, uh, I don't know, really nice. And I was thinkin' that, uh... I was really... The way I acted towards you was really wrong. And I, uh, I don't know, I don't want to lose you, you know? I was... I feel really comfortable with you. And I was thinkin' that if... If you, um... feel the same way and I do the same thing for you, that maybe we... We could get back together again. I love you, Jackie. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

I am not gonna jeopardize your career. He's an amateur. Listen to me. I have a feeling about the kid. I want you to try it with him. You've been taken in by... I haven't been taken in by anybody! You try it, goddamn it, and keep your personal feelings out of it. Let's go. Okay. All right, Butler, why don't you sit this one out? What do you mean, sit this one out? You know what I mean. No, I don't. Sure, you do. Manero! You know, the first combination. Oh. Music. Is this a dance or a bloody circus? Forget it, man. Too right. What are you looking at? Wait. I said wait! I don't want to talk about it, man. Don't walk out of here and expect to come back! Oh, is that right? That's right! You walk out the door now, you're over! What would you do? Don't worry what I would do. I'm not the one who's on the line, you are. I don't want anybody ever laughing at me. Who are you, somebody special? What'd you ever do means anything? What'd you ever do? I give you a chance for a lead in a Broadway show, and you walk out the door? Who cares? Who cares? Nobody has to care! In this business, I don't have to care about you, and you don't have to about me. And if you can't follow that, follow this. You wanna dance here, you follow my rules. It's not a democracy. You know, you are not the greatest dancer to ever hit Broadway. What you have is anger. And a certain intensity. And that's what I need to make this show work. What do you think, you're so terrific, you're gonna go out and score another show? The best thing that you ever scored in your whole life is Laura. But you even blew that 'cause you got too heavy with her. You're different kinds of people. And no matter how much you carry on, you're never gonna change that. If you had half a brain in that thick skull of yours, you'd stop worrying about trying to change other people... and start worrying about changing yourself. Everybody uses everybody, don't they? Go to hell, Manero! Who cares, man? All right, starting positions. And five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five... Hold it. Butler, would you mind? This is bullshit. Count it down.
