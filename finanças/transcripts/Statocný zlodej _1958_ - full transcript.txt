Let it be, I have to run, anyway. I can't even believe it, my brother. One has got to believe. I always believed we would be better off one day. When I think that I'm going to have a shop and today you are going to get... Jozko, look, your trousers are wet. Never mind, I'm in a real hurry. What would it look like to be late, and today of all days! Well then, good luck, Jozinko. - Mr. Pucik! - Good morning. Erzika, Mr. Pucik wants to say good morning to you! Good morning, Miss Erzika! Erzika wove it for you herself. For that big day of yours. Yes, please. Thank you. My regards to you. Did you see that finery? What a beautiful day... You know, I am going to receive my definitive tenure today. A permanent position. With a pension. Well, my existence... I will get two hundred a month more. My sister was promised a tobacco shop. You know, a widow, two children... rascals. Two hundred crowns. Ch, my goodness! I'll buy a stove for my sister's tobacco shop, winter coats for the children, I'll buy a new briefcase and marry. Right? HUMANITAS Charitable Society Again, Adamko? A fly is a living thing, just like you are. It flies, buzzes, is happy to be alive... You have to kill a fly because it's a nuisance. Remember: Thou shalt not kill! And that applies to flies too. The Charitable Society Human it as. I bow to you, madam Chairwoman. I wish you a respectful good morning. Miss Vierka? Miss Vierka... Yes, please, she has already arrived. She's already here. The Super intend an? I don't know, not yet I think, but definitely very soon... Ma'am? Rohaty here. 1 kiss your hands. Colleague Pucik is mistaken. I arrived first, I have already done a good deal of work. 1 kiss your hands, ma'am Chairwoman. - Good morning, gentlemen! - Good morning, Superintendant! Adam, keep watch for when the Chairwoman arrives! Mr. Pucik, can I have a word with you? Why did you say that Miss Vierka has arrived? You lied! You have deceived the Chairwoman. It will never happen again. You know very well that Miss Vierka is always the last one, - that she is careless, superficial. - She is young. She is a disorderly contractual force. But how pretty, Superintendant! Are you in love? Between the two of us, that's your business. But I don't know if the Chairwoman... You know, affairs in the office... An affair - never! The most solemn intentions, Superintendant. She has just arrived. Only she can slam the door so sweetly. - Hi, Adamko! - ... morning, Missy! You have to put that strip higher. Still higher! Not like that. Lower! Not like that. Crikey, you're so clumsy! There you are, if you please! And does Miss Vierka return your feelings? She... doesn't know anything yet. Love is war. He who fails to strike, cannot win. Well, just go for it, Mr. Pucik. Lest I forget, we received two thousand crowns yesterday. A charitable donation. - I'll record it right away. - Yes. But if you have a heart, you won't do it. Try to understand... A divorce, maintenance payments... Cod, I wouldn't wish that on anyone. I need that money. I'll just borrow it and return it within a week. No, no. As the Treasurer... Don't ask it of me! I really can't. And to lie in the teeth to the Chairwoman... that is, into the telephone, that you could do? Well, let it be, no one's forcing you. I get it, I'm not Miss Vierka, you don't want to help me. And my poor children... I don't have a single penny. Take it, Superintendant. My sister has children too. A widow. I know how difficult it can be sometimes. No! No! Thank you, friend. - And mainly... On your hon our? - On my hon our! Good morning, Miss Vierka! ...morning. Don't just stand there, hold it! - Ouch! - How clumsy you are! - Does it hurt? - It doesn't hurt from you, Miss Vierka. You are quite impossible. So old-fashioned. On a stroll with me on Sunday... would you go? With you? On a date? I'll get tenure. Two hundred crowns more. Congratulations. So what? Then not? But we see each other every day. From eight to two. That's enough, isn't it? Miss Vierka, but I... Oh, excuse me. Dictation please, Miss. Bravo, just go for it! Please... Why are you being so official today, honey? Do Not Enter! Engaged. The old hag's already here! The Chairwoman's car has stopped in front of the house! Let's go! Rehearsal, folks! Esteemed Chairwoman! Today, when our charitable society celebrates one year of its existence... Oh my goodness, Pucik, what are you looking like? And so on, and so on... And at the end all of you will go: Hurrah! Let us try it out. - Hurrah! - Hurrah! One more time! Hurrah! The Chairwoman... MUSIC SCHOOL Don't worry, she's insured. Hurrah! Mr. Pucik, thank you. Dear colleagues, thank you for your gifts. But now, let's get to work! I admire your stamina and self-sacrifice, ma'am. I serve a big idea. The idea of philanthropy. I took charge of forty thousand today. A subsidy from the Ministry. Pucik should take the statements and money to the bank! Wait, I'll sign it. Oh, my God! I'm still trembling. I admit it, I was really afraid in that elevator. Thank goodness that Pucik was so prompt to react. Apropos, he's supposed to get a definitive tenure, right? Yes, starting today. He deserves it. He is a modest and honest employee. My school, ma'am. TELLER Ma'am, you gave those forty thousand crowns to the Superintendant Rohaty, right? Personally. Into his own hands! I don't know anything else, I don't get it. Commissioner, I am totally perplexed! The Chairwoman personally gave you this leather folder with forty thousand. What have you done with it? Speak, please! I took the aforementioned leather folder and went to my office, well, actually into it. As you know, I am the Superintendant of the charitable society, I serve a big and noble concept selflessly, I patiently do my minute and painstaking, albeit responsible and gruelling work. I usually immediately carry out the orders of our Chairwoman. I instantly called our young correspondent this time too. I gave her the folder with the money and instructed her to send Mr. Pucik straightaway with the money to the bank. After that, I have nothing further in common with the whole thing. Having fulfilled the Chairwoman's order, I immersed myself into everyday office work. Listen, I beg your pardon. What do you want from me? I did not steal that money. We'll see, Missy! Did you take charge of this leather folder with the money? And what happened afterwards? What happened afterwards? What should have happened? I went into my office and there was... there was nothing there... no one. Then our attendant walked in. I told him that Mr. Pucik has to go to the bank and he said Pucik was in the corridor, and I told him to call Pacik, that I had other things to do than to run around chasing Pucik. Please ask him about the rest and leave me alone! What were you doing in the corridor? I was talking to my sister. She came to see me as she needed... - Needed what? - Money. - How much? - Two crowns for the tram. I gave my sister two crowns, so that she had money to return home. She was promised a tobacco shop, so she has to do a lot of running around, poor woman. Then... Adamko called me. Our attendant, and I returned to my office. Miss Vierka told me: “You have forty thousand in there, 50 get moving, Jozko, and make sure no one robs you on the way." She always jokes with me like that when I take money to the bank. Stop! And you didn't even count the money? What for? Miss Vierka gave me the money, after all. And what if she deceived you? Miss Vierka? Deceived me? It's clear that you don't know her. Commissioner, don't worry. The money will be found, you'll see. Continue! But the truth! I admit that my head was full of those forty thousand. Oh, my God, what you could buy for that money! I could buy a stove for my sister's tobacco shop, sweets for the children and I would still have enough for a new briefcase. You know, I will get my tenure today and my old briefcase won't do any longer. So I thought about all this and, absorbed in my thoughts, I almost ran under a car. Fortunately, nothing happened to the car. But when I picked up my briefcase, I saw that it had already served its time. As always, when I take money to the bank, I never speak to anyone, I never stop anywhere. I will tell you the truth, today I stopped somewhere. I beg your pardon, but my teeth are troubling me and so I wanted to buy something good and cheap against pain. You know, my canine really hurts, and a civil servant with a tenure must also have his teeth in order. Visitors notice all sorts of things. I forgot that I only had those forty thousand with me. Apart from that, I had nothing. I gave my last two crowns to my sister. Well, I went straight to the bank and I didn't stop anywhere else. That is... only... just one more time... GENTLEMEN But I suppose that doesn't belong here. Couldn't you have waited? You take care of your teeth, of this and that, and suddenly forty thousand is gone! When did you discover it? Only in the bank. The money was suddenly gone. As if the earth had swallowed it up. I couldn't believe my eyes. I thought I was dreaming, that I was out of my mind, that it wasn't even me. That's all, Commissioner. Every one of you had the forty thousand in their hands. Except for him. Each one of you could be the perpetrator. - And I am asking you: Who? - That is the question. Pardon, we are asking you, Commissioner! - Do you have any property? - No. - Imprisoned? - Once. Misdemeanour, of fence, felony? I jumped out of a tram. Oh, a fruitcake! Bye-bye! - Do you have any vices? - Vices? Alcohol, cards, women? It's a woman. Talk! Yes, please, a woman, Commissioner. Was there any theft in your Society? Embezzlement, malpractice, malversation? Commissioner, everything was always in order in my Society. Are you quite certain, ma'am? We checked your finances. You received two thousand crowns yesterday. Superintendant Rohaty took charge of them. Two thousand crowns, but no sign of them in the treasury. Could you explain that to us, Treasurer? Do you want something? No, no, well... colleague Pucik surely... ...could not have, did not manage to, right, Mr. Pucik? Why are you silent? Where's the money? I'll return it. I'll return it within a week. I borrowed it, please. The Society's money? That's an outrage! From the human perspective, ma'am, ... can understand it. Pucik supports his sister and her children. I can vouch for him! If he doesn't return the money within a week, please make use of my money. No, I won't allow you to suffer a loss for such a... Ugh, Pucik! I would never have thought that! But now this is not about two thousand, but about the forty thousand. More precisely, about forty-two thousand! In the name of law, I arrest you! Please. But you must be wrong, Commissioner. Thank you, you can go. And we will put you on remand. Me? Into prison? But I will get my definitive tenure today! Definitive tenure? Definitive dismissal, you rogue, you crook! Ma'am! I am innocent! Jozko, my brother, - after all, I did not... - Get the tobacco shop. They said that “your brother is a civil servant”. That you allegedly have a good job. A definitive tenure. They have deceived me too and they don't trust me. But you know that your brother cannot be a thief. Everyone knows me, the whole courtyard. Don't worry. You'll see, everything will be fine. Attention! Listen, Pucik, don't cause me any trouble! Please, confess. - I would confess... - Well... But I have nothing to confess to. - Where's the money? - Judge, I really don't know. - Who stole it? - If you please, I don't know. Man, I am supposed to be leaving for a health vacation. And do you know what's holding me up? You! Your lack of consideration! Don't be annoyed, don't rack your brains. Maybe the money just got lost. Maybe one day an honest finder will appear and say: Here's the forty thousand. Here you are. Pucik, I'll have you examined. You're not normal. T, L, T, A, F, X, L, C, O, E, F.. — Sight normal... -...D, Z, L, A... - Ouch! - Hearing normal. Reflexes normal. Show me your tongue. Better! Normal? Repeat: Dritte reitende Artilleriebrigade! Dritte, ritte, dritte... Dritende, britende, ritende... Are there any drunkards, lunatics, paralytics in your family? No. You don't have any either, right? You... skiver! Drunkard, paralytic, blimey! Get away! Duty all week long! Immediately! The corridor and toilets! You'll soon learn better, you skiver! Pucik? I am Doctor Gold finger and I don't have time. I am your duty defence attorney. - Why are you dressed as a convict? - Why should I ruin my own clothes? Did you confess? I am innocent, Doctor. You can lie as much as you wish in court - I'll teach you how. Now tell me the truth. Where is the money? I've never stolen anything in my whole life. Stop having me on, man! I won't get a penny for you! Doctor, if you don't have time, don't let me keep you here. I'll defend myself best. Your wife? - Are you having an affair with her? -Me? Gifts, jewellery, illegitimate children? I beg your pardon! You stole for her, Pucik! A woman like that needs a lot of money. We know that. And do you know the Ten Commandments? Thou shalt not steal! Thou shalt not commit adultery! I stick to that, Doctor! Me and steal! Me and have an affair! Ha! Thank you for such an attorney! And I will be your defence attorney! You're an interesting case! Indeed, I will be! Baranek Alojz, new cellmate. Welcome. Jozef Pucik, please. Did you go berserk? You're doing time for the first time, right? I'm like at home here. Assault and battery, that is my specialisation. You know, not every marriage works out. Would you like to eat? The last time I was banged up with a triple murderer. A very gentle man. You're supposed to be a thief? I don't care. I'll hang out with anyone. Mr. Baranek, I am not a thief. If you knew my case... Pucik, visitor! A woman. - Who? - Someone from your office. It's her! Miss Vierka! Oh, my God, Mr. Pucik, what have they done to you? Co away, please. But Mr. Pucik, I was looking forward to seeing you. You hurt me. But the situation has changed. Has the money been found? No. But don't you understand? What were you before? An ordinary Treasurer. And now? You're a social case! We'll take care of you in an exemplary manner. We have entered you in the register under number three thousand. - We already have three thousand cases? - Yes, yes. We have new cases - some unemployed, beggars, tramps, prostitutes unable to work... - We are growing, Mr. Pucik, growing. - Really a beautiful result. I will also get an hon our from the Minister. Miss Vierka... - did she enter me in the index? - Certainly. The blue forms are in the upper drawer, the index in the left-hand cabinet in the seventh drawer on the right, it has to be entered in triplicate. - Besides that... - Everything is fine. You are our jubilee record. Number three thousand, thief section. Thief? Do you believe that I stole? Oh, my God, how sensitive you are! That's why we must support you. Thank you, I don't need it. I am innocent. Don't ruin my statistics! I beg you, as a former employee. First you take my job, then you want to support me. You have me jailed, then you make me into a case. A number. Ma'am, thank you for visiting me. Won't you even come to our Sunday courses? We'll be expecting you! All of us will be there. The Superintendant, even Miss Vierka... I'll be there! Dear friends! At the course organised for your fun and edification by the Charitable Society Human it as, we have prepared a joyful surprise for you - colour slides. Man has been trying to express a sense of justice for a long time by suitable and useful means. Torture and corporal punishments followed one noble objective - for man to reform himself. Even these images talk about love for thy neighbour, about justice. As you see, the hand of justice used to be sterner in the past. However, our modern times brought huge technical progress. With the invention of the electric chair. Humanism! That's the catchword of our period. And the Charitable Society Human it as, led by its meritorious Chairwoman, selflessly tries to do its best to render this word a reality. Hurrah, long live! Hurrah! Long live! Hurrah! Now follows a moral story with illuminated images about the reform of the former convict Koloman Oriesok. Who was Koloman Oriesok? We used to walk about round this man who looked like a lamb and we had no inkling... - Miss Vierka! - How are you? - Now... fine. - Of course, such a rich man. - I swear, I did not steal the money. - You don't say so. Vierka, don't you believe me? We will go out for a walk as soon as you're released. I'll be waiting for you, dear Jozko. That was the story of the former convict Oriesok who reformed himself thanks to courses of the Human it as Society. Dear convicts, let him be a shining example for you on the road to a new, better life. Thank you and good-bye. Long live the Chairwoman! Hurrah! Long live! Hurrah, long live! I've already returned those two thousand crowns on your behalf. So that thing is in order. Only those forty thousand are missing in the treasury. — They tell me you haven't confessed yet. - You don't believe me either... I don't have that money, Superintendant. I have only my hon our and I'll defend that. Finish smoking! I'll be released soon, you'll see! Is it clear why Pucik received a two-day release from prison? Repeat! I should tail him, keep an eye on him, trace who he's in contact with, where he hid the money, be everywhere, see everything and report immediately! Your promotion depends on the Pucik case. Judge, should I work with a mask or without one? Do as you wish! Are you still here? What? Who's he talking to? A child? What? About a two-year-old child? You moron! The staff we get today! Jozko! Jozinko! Are you looking for something, please? So you see, this is my shop. We're well off now. But you, poor thing... Don't worry, Vilmuska. I'll soon be released. Ten Zoras, a pack of Memphis and matches. - Odd sort of guy. - He's from us, the police. But tell me, how did you actually get the tobacco shop? The Chairwoman helped me. And both my children were sent to the Tatras. Free of charge. I even received benefits, nearly two hundred crowns. It was all her doing. A soul of gold. And you accepted everything? I deserve it, right? After all, someone has to take care of the relatives of a thief. Thief? Thief? Vilmuska, what are you talking about? You surely know me, at least you must believe me! But I believe you, Jozko. Nobody believes me. Farewell, Vilmuska. Jozko, come back! Aren't you even going home? Vierka! My dear Vierka! Aperitif, please? Wait! Give it here! Everything! So are you going to pay or not? Head waiter, everything in vain. Cheers! And who's going to pay? Shall I call the police? No need, head waiter. He'll pay it! Because I am Pucik. In person, head waiter. The well-known thief, Jozef Pucik. Forty thousand at the very least. I don't pay trifling amounts! Fresh chestnuts! Maroni! Fresh maroni! Roast chestnuts! Fresh chestnuts! Maroni! Fresh maroni! Roast chestnuts! Gotcha! And now we'll go together! Oh, my goodness, Pucik, how did you recognise me? Mr. Pucik, please don't destroy me. Don't say anything to the judge. If you do, I'll be fired. Don't worry, you police nark. Come on, you're paying! - Hi, Gustik! - Hi, Jozinko! They chased me for three days, But they didn't get me anyway... They'll chase me another three days, But they won't get me anyway. They'll chase me another three days, But they won't get me anyway. Today I'm in the valley, Tomorrow in the cemetery, Today musicians play for me, Tomorrow they'll hang me... Today musicians play for me, Tomorrow they'll hang me... - Jozinko, are you my friend? - Sure, I'm your friend. - A good friend? - Honest friend, Gustik! - Well, then confess, Jozinko! — I confess. I am a thief! I stole thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions! I set Bratislava Castle on fire, I stole, destroyed everything! If you really confessed, I would be promoted. Then I could marry... I would get a definitive tenure. Definitive tenure? Let's go! One, two, one, two, one...! You know thieves. What kind of people are they? Decent. And aren't you ashamed to shake hands with a thief? Why? What would I live off if there were no thieves? Listen. A well-preserved widow offers marriage. A butcher will accept you as his partner if you invest the money in his business. And here, two young ladies... I'm sorry, I opened your letters. You know, I had nothing to read. Everyone believes I've got money. Everyone believes I'm a thief. In the end, they'll say I caused the World War. And what if I really had stolen the money? It couldn't have been anyone else. Of course! I took the money from the envelope and put it in my pocket. That's quite clear! I am a thief. I am a thief. I am a thief! I'am a thief! I am a thief! I'am a thief! I am a thief! How easy it is to get used to it. I am wholly convinced that I stole. Alojz, I confess! Be reasonable! Why? Why? So that my sister gets the tobacco shop, benefits, clothes, children in the Tatras. So that the Chairwoman gets an hon our, the secret police officer gets definitive tenure, the judge his holidays, so that... Oh, Baranek, I'm just in everyone's way! But I know you didn't steal the money. I believe you're innocent. That doesn't matter! It doesn't matter who really stole the money. Don't you see that? The world is too tight a place. There isn't room for all! I confess! I confess! I confess! I confess! I confess! I confess. At today's practicum in criminal law you will see the wonderful result of investigation methods in modern justice. Ladies and gentlemen! You're all familiar with the case of Jozef Pucik. The case of a human hyena who cynically wormed his way into the charitable society to ultimately rob it. Isn't it unpleasant for you to stand? Do take a seat. Please. Pucik, who persistently denied it until now, has confessed today. Please. I already was a criminal case as a child. I pulled the wings off flies, I tortured them and was happy when they desperately buzzed from pain. - Sadism. - Yes. I emptied nests, strangled little birdies and flung them brutally to the ground. I sprinkled chili under the cat's tail and derived great pleasure when he ran around as if mad. Carry on! Later I discovered a new passion. I took pleasure from lifting things out of my friends' pockets. I was visiting my friends, and while the others leafed through the photo album, I stole the piano. - Kleptomania. - Yeah. - Did you have drinkers in your family? - All! Even the women. There were always at least three drunks lying senseless in our house. How long have you been planning to rob Human it as? Right from the cradle, please. Explain how you performed the theft. Easily. I sneaked into the Human it as Society like a hyena just to eventually cynically rob it. - And where have you stashed the stolen money? - I don't have it. Do you want to turn this into a farce again? Do you want to deny it? Cod forbid! But I really don't have the money. - I squandered everything. - Explain how! How? Well... easily! In a few nights, with loose women. Bars, cards, parties... cancan. Whoopee! Dancing on the table... Rivers of champagne. We drank it from shoes, please. Yes, that is the truthful picture of Jozef Pucik. Sinful passions, the hereditary burdened sub-conscience. And behold, the sad result. A moral quagmire seated here before you. A pariah who suffers pangs of remorse at night, which do not allow him a wink of sleep. Which... Two point five permille alcohol! The normal physiological level is point zero three. - So Pucik was drunk? - Totally plastered, colleague. Thank you, doctor. Two point five. That's not possible! Then... Then my client's confession is not valid. He didn't know what he was saying. You drunk! You get drunk yesterday and today you recant everything! No, please, I won't recant anything! - So you confess? - Yes, to everything. Pucik, your confession doesn't exist. Judge, he is innocent. I will prove it, even if against his will. He did not steal those forty thousand. If you manage to do that, I still have a backup. - What backup? - The two thousand that I embezzled. That is a fact. Superintendant Rohaty will testify to it. The Human it as Society does not wish to proceed further in this matter. You see! I ask you, Judge: Why does this man want to be imprisoned, to besmear his name, to destroy his peaceful existence? Peaceful existence! What do you know? - Judge, put up a fight! - But he's defending you, man! What, you don't say! I don't need such a defence! I confessed and that's that! I've never experienced anything like this before! Judge, relieve me of his defence. I'm leaving. Bye! Give me Human it as. Yes, talking. Well, finally! Yes, thank you. And a pleasant vacation, Judge. Ma'am, Pucik has now confessed. Superintendant, I mixed up the envelopes. I've found the money now. It was here all along. Pucik is innocent! Oh, my God!
