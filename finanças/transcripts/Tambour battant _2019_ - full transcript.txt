One, two. ROLL THE DRUM! Monchoux, Valais April 1970 Wait for me! Thanks. Ah! What is it? You'll see. This way. Ah, there! Move. Look at this. What do you think? Isn't it beautiful? Where is it from? Are the sleeves a bit long? Where are these suits from? I thought for the audition I might as well dress up. What do you think? It looks like a circus costume. You'd better worry about your own outfit. I won't do it anyway. - What? - Sorry? I'm too old to carry a stupid flower basket. - Please, dear! - That's not up to you anyway. Where did you get these suits from? You'll have to take up an inch or so. Aloys, but... Aloys. Did you buy those suits with my car money? Honestly, Marie-Thérèse, does it matter whether you get your car now or in six months? If you need to go somewhere, just ask me. - I knew you wouldn't understand. - What? That you decide for me? That you decide when I can do things? Terrible! You're terrible, goddammit! You need to wake up! The uniforms won't help you in the audition! Aloys... I don't want to hear a word. From the top, now. - You really think we are terrible? - Yes. Especially you, you're all over the place! - Let's go! - No. You've been the conductor for 12 years. We've played the same music for 12 years. - So what? - Well... We haven't won anything in 12 years. And we haven't played anywhere else in 12 years. If we fail the audition again, we'll have to wait another 3 years. We need to stop complaining. This year is our year, I can feel it. - Let's go! - No, not me! Aloys, I'm sorry... A few of us think we need a professional conductor. A few of you? Who? Who else agrees? All right, those of you standing, put your uniforms in the closet, you're no longer part of the band. - Go find a professional. - We hired him, he's on his way. Who's your father? You look familiar. That's possible. Where are you going? I'm going to conduct a marching band. With my dog. Dad, it's me, Pierre. There you are. How are you? - Who's with you? - No one. I can hear breathing. Oh yeah, that's Chevrolet. It's a dog. I brought it to you as a gift. I don't like dogs. It's an interesting class. You need to listen and focus. Come on, let's go. - Goodbye, young lady. - Goodbye. - Hello Chantal. - Marie-Thérèse. - Do you have a minute? - Of course. Goodbye. Are you in this thing... Bye. - ...for women's suffrage? - Yes, I'm trying to help. - I would like to help as well. - Really? Yes. Why? Can't I help? Of course you can. It's just that, knowing your husband... Isn't it going to be a problem? Yes. Guys, imagine this on the barricades! - Nice cover! Who's this for? - Sarah. Sarah. Here you are. Thank you. Anyway, I'm telling you this, but Paris is quiet right now. - Nothing's moving there anymore. - Same here. Here, if you want things moving, you must sit, and down a few. Really? Then let's get things moving. This round is on me. Cheers, guys! Cheers and welcome. By the way, could I get a small advance? I haven't had time to organize... No problem, I'll take care of it. No way! Yes, that's him, Aloys! Aloys Girroux, wow! I almost didn't recognize you. Maybe because... Yeah, you've aged a bit, haven't you? - How are you? - I'm okay. Good. What about Marie-Thérèse? And the little Colinette? She must have grown. They're okay as well. So I heard you were in town for a bit. A little longer, actually. I've been asked to get a marching band to the Federal Music Feast. There must have been a mistake. You see, I'm the conductor of the band. And I will get the band to the Federal Music Feast. Well that's great! Do your thing with your band, and since I've been hired to conduct a band, I guess I will. With this motley crew? Don't worry, there'll be others. You'll see, you'll like it. Look at this! They put up more. We already tore them off, here. This board is reserved for municipal posters. They have no respect. Hello gentlemen. How nice of you to make room. What are you doing? - Chantal asked for my help. - What's this? You're into politics, now? - No, she's not. - She's into whatever she wants. - You're making a spectacle of yourself. - Really? Should I buy a pretty suit? We'll talk at home. Come on, guys, we're not done. Goodbye. - We can tear that one off too, later. - We'll see. I'm in London, working on a solo album, with a good team. Listen, can we talk later? Okay, keep in touch. Bye. This dog is a pain. Can't you get rid of it? Gus came by earlier to drop off an envelope for you. It must be here somewhere. Tell me, is Roduit still your notary? Why? I'd like to sell the plot of land. You must be kidding. I'm not. Why do you think I'm here? I need money. - You can't do that. - Why not? Mom left it to me, I can do what I want with it. Pierre, you were born on that land! And I won't die on it. I think I found an interesting blend. Why won't you understand? The cellar is no place for a girl! Come on, out. Have a taste. You'll be surprised. No, I'm working, here. I don't have time for this. You'd better try on your dress. Why don't you get it? I won't be in your stupid band. Ever again! Colinette! Hey, young lady, don't you say hello anymore? - Pierre. - Yes, that's me! You're running away. You haven't changed at all. Your father must be happy. Have you ever seen my father happy? I'm relieved that he's not alone anymore. After the fire, we were all worried. Why didn't you come? He could've died, you know? Yeah, I know. Carlo? Here. - What is it? - For your mother. - You already paid her. - Please, take it. Thanks. The price of your silence. We should go fetch the latecomers, no? What latecomers? - This is all of you? - Yes, we're all here. Everyone in your places. Good, not bad at all. I talked to the florist, we're all set. What? Another 50 roses? Yes. Duly noted. Yes, Chantal, consider it done. Fantastic, there will be loads of people at the conference, for sure. I'm thrilled! Of course, consider it done. See you soon. Will you stop this nonsense? People in the village are gossiping. When I have my car, maybe I'll focus on other things. Oops! Well done! No, thanks, I'm good. Would your band play at our conference? Are you kidding me? My band plays for Corpus Christi and for great events, not for... Never mind. Pierre's band offered to play. Are you serious? Which side are you on, Marie-Thérèse? The women's side. - We must take action! - You're right. Roger, another round, please. A different one! You don't like it? You might not care, but I do. He'll walk all over us, I'm telling you. Not at all. Aloys, don't get all wound up. There's only one marching band in Monchoux: ours. Everyone knows it. Did you see how many cows are in his band? If they could blow into brass as well as they clean it, we'd know! And the wops! Don't tell me you're afraid of a wop marching band! Are you all deaf? Have you heard his band? If that took two or three rehearsals, they're going to slaughter us at the audition. Bravo, good music. It's nice, isn't it? Do you know who I am? What about these gentlemen? Do you know them? - Yes. - All right. You are here because we hired you. You're going to "listeno mio" now. That's Italian. So... We are in Switzerland, in Monchoux, to be precise. There will be an audition for the Federal Music Feast in Monchoux. A Swiss feast. With a Swiss marching band. Several! Here's the thing, if we hear that even one of you keeps playing in the other marching band, we'll escort you to the border immediately. Understood? Good. Now, go have a drink. It's on us. Come on, fellas. Come on. You sing very well. Ah, music... Come on, go. No, you stay here. Thank you, guys. Come here. Come, I said. I don't want any trouble, I just want to work. Sit down. There you go. You will stay in that other guy's marching band, and you'll tell me what goes on. No, I'm not a snitch, I can't do that. No? Tell me, would you like to keep working? Great. That's a good boy. They're not coming? That's not possible, we need to go get them now. They don't want to get fired. They're here to work, not to play music. Making money is important, sure, but what are we going to do? We lost our best members. No offense. Our meeting is coming to an end. Before we go share a friendly drink, with music, are there any questions? Madam? In countries that have allowed women to vote, we've seen it hasn't changed much. So what's the point? Isn't it a waste of time? A waste? I don't think that worrying about women's future in this country is a waste of time. In fact, our men are listening to us, so let's make sure they hear us. - Here! - No, thanks. One, two. It's a bit complicated, but we'll make it. Let people know we need new musicians. I won't let that slide. It's nice of them to participate. - Are you proud of yourself? - About what? - Don't be a smartass. - I think it went well. I'm talking about Pierre's band. At any rate, whoever did that is despicable. Gentlemen, please. First of all, I'd like to thank the elders who accepted to play again. Thanks. Bravo! - Thank you. - What did he say? Today, we're going to start with something new. Great. Don't worry, we'll just play the Marignan march, but at a slightly faster tempo, to make it more lively for the audition. Let's go. Why? It's fine the way it is, no? Is it your sweetheart's idea? What now? What's his problem? Goddammit! They stole our jackets! What? They stole our jackets. We have filed your complaint. All you need now is to be patient. Patient? Henri! The Federal Feast is coming, what will we look like without jackets? I know, but you need to stay confident. 30 marching band jackets are harder to hide than a silver spoon. I notified the border guards, they'll keep their eyes peeled. No, Henri! It's not the Italians. I'm speaking from experience. - I'm not racist, but... - No. ...most of the thefts here are done by Italians. I can even tell you that if the bill for the expulsion of foreigners is passed and they're forced to go home, you'd better not leave anything lying around! Stop with your thing, I'm telling you it's not them. You must look into Pierre. Which Pierre? Pierre Crettaz. Robert's son? Of course, it can only be him! Why would he do that? To piss us off, that's it! I'm sorry, but a police search requires something more substantial! Substantial? What's substantial? Fellas, most of you know each other well by now, but it's time to meet our new members. Let's start with Birgitte on the trombone! Gilda on the violon. They're both very active in the movement... Frauenbefreiungsbewegung. - Right, in the Haut-Valais. - Welcome! Next, Bernard on the sax. Gerald on the banjo. Solange on the clarinette. Members of the Independent Social Movement in the Chablais! Now let's greet Regi on the sax. Perle on the trombone. And Nuage and her drum. Hello, Robert. George-André. Still have rashes? My rashes aren't what's bothering me. Do you know what your boy is up to? It depends. A marching band with women, immigrants, thugs, and maybe even socialists! What the hell is this? You might want to give your kid an earful! Why is he staring at me? He doesn't like the look of some people. Good boy Chevrolet, good boy. Chevrolet, no! Good, thank you. So you don't have any dried meat? - What? - No, I'm out. Then give me a pound of meat and offals for the dog, please. Well, I'm out of that as well. What are you talking about? We have plenty. Don't get involved. - Why are you telling her that? - Look... Robert, this really isn't against you, but let's say that... A few of us in the village have decided to... We've collectively decided to no longer serve those who support Pierre's marching band. - Why tell me this? - Don't take it badly. It's not against you. Look, I don't care about your bullshit. So you won't serve me? It's not that I don't want, it's not... - I can't. - Yeah, okay. Is the exit this way? Are you coming, Chevrolet? Mom? What do you want? I'm going to Joceline's, I won't be long. What? Hi. I came to thank you for the glasses. You should't be here. - Are you not happy to see me? - You can't stay. If people catch us... Is this where you sleep? - Are these your parents? - Yes. Please, we need to go. Thank you so much for your commitment and your support, but we talked with Chantal and the others and we think it's best your band doesn't play on the day of the vote. Wonderful. Who thinks that, you or Chantal? Does it matter? A lot. If it's you, it's not the same thing. Stop it. Please be serious. Some people in the village might get upset, and push the vote the wrong way. Incredible, you sound like a politician. You're a quick learner. - Are you making fun of me? - No. On the contrary. So you agree? Oh, yeah, but I'm not alone in this thing. - It's a band. - Please. Sorry, could you repeat that? Please. Yes, that pleases me. I'll see what I can do. I'll talk to them. Are we only going to talk about politics? We could also talk about... What? About... Wine, for instance, or... Many things. You're coming home late. Chantal wasn't doing well. I stayed a bit longer with her. I have good news. - Did you find your jackets? - No, not yet. But my band agreed to play on the day of the vote. Yes indeed! I'm tired of hearing about your marching bands. I'm going to bed. I forgot that one. Why? - Why do you do that? - What? Why do you steal from the church? Don't worry, it's for a good cause. As soon as I have enough, I'll leave. - You want to leave? - I don't want to stay in this dump. I'll leave as soon as I can. Nothing is keeping me here. Young boys, on this day, that will remain engraved in your memories, we are calling you to join the historical marching band of Monchoux. It is an honor that comes with certain duties. The first duty is commitment. An unfailing commitment and loyalty to the community that is welcoming you into its midst. What are you doing here, sir? This is a private meeting. Can you take over for a few minutes? I'll be right back. Young ones, your fathers stood here before you. - Any news about the jackets? - No. Okay, what about the rest? Nothing much, I don't know what to tell you. Come on, there must be something going on in that band. Anyone driving without a licence, or working illicitly? Say something, anything! I heard something, but I didn't see anything. Tell me. Marijuana. Mari... Marijuana. The drug? Drugs are perfect! That's great. Drugs are ideal! Who knows, maybe one day you'll be standing where I am, at this podium. I'm not going to lie, getting where I am today is no walk in the park. You need to be sure-footed, you need to watch your step, and stay on the right path. You also have to look at where you want to be. Otherwise, you might pass where you wanted to be, and you'll have to go back. See, it's not easy. Anything else? No. You're hiding something. That's enough, go away. How could you do that? Have you lost your mind? I can't believe it. - What? - What you've done. Reporting a childhood friend. As soon as I saw him, I knew it would end this way. What are you talking about? You're confused. I'm not confused. Stop lying to me. If you want to be with him, go ahead. I won't hold you back. See, the door is wide open. I don't get it. - Don't worry, it's only... - What? It's only for a few days. Yep! What are you doing, why aren't you at rehearsal? I was in the cellar, I carried some heavy boxes alone. I made a wrong move and I heard a snap. Sorry guys, you'll have to rehearse without me. What about the audition? We're screwed without you! You're lucky Marie-Thérèse is here to care for you. Yeah, you're right, I'm lucky. - We'll let you rest. - Okay. Go ahead. Right. FREE HIM NOW! FREE PIERRE CRETTAZ! POLICE STATE! Henri, you should have your liver checked. Your eyes are a bit yellow. How can you tell? I can't see very well, but certain things, I just know. Do you know why Pierre hasn't said anything? He's protecting me, he's completely innocent. This is all mine. You're putting me in an awkward position. I know, but it's the only thing that soothes me. I'm not the only one. What do you mean? Look... I'm bound by professional secrecy. but I've been giving some to your wife for a long time. Jesus Christ! To my wife? Yes. - Marijuana? - Yes. If you want, I can go to jail. Of course not. I'll find a solution. I don't know which one yet, but I will. I don't know what happened. That's enough. Which wine is this? - Dad? - What? What is this wine? It's a new blend. That's not true. It's your wine. Your blend. I made it based on your notes. And? - It's good. - Is it? It's good. I never... I never managed to make wine like that. Are you just being nice? You think I'll be happy if people find out that my daughter makes my wine? What will people say? That you trained your daughter well. Okay. Thank you so much for your support. Let me tell you, even in my isolated cell, I never felt alone, thanks to you. Those squares showed us how low they could go. We'll show them how high our spirit is. They want to play on the day of the vote? We will play as well! They want to audition for the Federal Feast? We will be there as well! - We'll make those bastards pay! - Damn right! From now on, the gloves are off! Dad is not doing well, you know? I need a bit more time, Colinette. But I won't come back until your dad and Pierre settle their fight. What's the matter? Nothing, just a memory. The same thing happened 20 years ago. History repeats itself. They fought over who has the best band? No. They fought over me. Listen... I wanted to thank you for... If you really want to thank me, Don't sell the land. No, he told me not to move, and to rest. My healer is three times better. You'll thank me later, stop arguing. That's enough! Start the engine, Arsène! Let's go. What will your healer think? He's fantastic, he can even do it on the phone. - Why didn't we call him? - His line isn't connected yet. Jesus Christ! I knew it! Goddammit! I knew it! Bastards! Look at that! It's okay, we can clean them up! Look, they wrote... They wrote "Fuck You". Is that in Italian? That bastard! Is your back better? You know what? I was this close to letting go. I was about to calm things down. - But what you've done is horrendous. - Horrendous. Let me tell you what's horrendous. Threatening to fire your employees is horrendous, or considering that women and foreigners and everyone outside the village don't deserve your pathetic uniforms. You came to lecture me? You're a fine one to talk. Let me tell you, you can come and talk to me when you hire a foreigner in your band. A lecture? - Should we talk about my wife? - Aloys. Get off of me! Leave me alone! Fuck off! What do you think you're doing? He started it, he said my dad is in the homosexuals' marching band. You go there and you stay there. Did you see that? They're savages. That's the leftist marching band! - Did you witness it? - I didn't see anything, but it's obvious. Do they need to paint the church red for you to move your ass? Tell me, Carlo, where did you learn to play the trumpet? At home, with my dad. With your dad. Is it true that you're doing all the solos in Pierre's band? Yes. You know what? You're going to play in my band, now. No. What? I'm done with this, no more band, no more trumpet. From now on I'll do my job, nothing more. Either you do what I want, or you take your stuff and leave. Carlo... Carlo! Hi, Robert! You've become quite the animal lover. By the way, my cows would like to thank you. Your cows? Yes. Didn't you hear? We may have our differences, but business is business. Your boy sold me his land. Let's grab a drink. The land? He sold you the land? - Will you vote tomorrow? - No. Are you against women's suffrage? I'm against the elders' suffrage. You know we're playing tomorrow? Who doesn't? The village is divided over it. Well, you didn't need me to split it up. I would really appreciate it if you came. Remember my first time in the marching band? You gave me a little drum. I remember I was very proud that day. You'd like me to attend? Very much so. Why would I do that? I know about the land. Of course. No matter what I do, I'll always do the wrong thing. - Do you think we'll ever be able to talk? - About what? Nothing. Never mind. Let's not make promises and everything. Ciao, and good luck with your life. Without the promises and everything, I won't leave. His dad taught him. If that wop joins our band, I'm out. Who else agrees? Listen, we're lucky enough to live in a model democracy, so we'll all vote with a show of hands. Who wants Carlo Giovanola to join the historical marching band of Monchoux? One, two, five... All right. Carlo Giovannola is joining our band. - George-André! - Go to hell! Welcome, Carlo. Those broads want to take over. And those dirty leftists... Fellas, today we're going to have some fun. Forward march! - How are we doing? - Not good. - Burst snare drum. - Okay. Two bent trumpets. Dented tuba, the triangle looks like a square... We lost Delco, broken collar bone. Perle's fingers are all crooked and Bernard has a smashed nose. So we're five men down so far. Gilda, Monique, Sarah and the others, today, as you know it, you now have the right to vote in the Valais. I think that's wonderful. Really. So... Congratulations to all of you. I didn't know I'd be here today and go through all of this with you. I am happy and proud of it. So I'd like to thank you all. This Saturday, as you know it, is the audition for the Federal Music Feast. Look at you. Look at me. We were provoked, we were attacked and offended. But we're still standing. And we will be standing tall and proud of who we are when we play at the audition. Bravo! Idiots! Those idiots! 7 Hail Mary et 5 Our Father, goddammit. Shit. All right. So you want to play? Yes? - Who is it? - George-André. If you came to apologize, you're too late. I won't apologize, you will. Don't waste my time. You know, that guy you're so proud of? The new kid, the little song bird. He's got his hands on more than his trumpet. Capito? Don't let me catch you around here again! Bastard. Little shit. He touched my daughter. They want to play? We're going to play. Okay! Hello? Hi, Marie-Thérèse. Marie-Thérèse? - What are you doing here? - And you? What? Great. Come on. Open, Marie-Thérèse! This is ridiculous. Marie-Thérese, hey! - Is there another exit? - No. I can't believe this. It opens the other way. - You still can't handle your wife. - Say that again? What? What are you doing? Stop this bullshit! That's enough! You've got to be kidding! Stop this bullshit. Enough. If we scream, will anybody hear us? No. Tell me... Have you slept with Marie-Thérèse? What? I'm asking you whether you slept with my wife. - Do you want a glass? - No. I'm not trying to poison you. I didn't make it, Colinette did. Your daughter makes your wine now? Is that a problem? On the contrary. Wow, not bad at all. Well... It's better than your cheap wine. You're just as dumb as you were when you were a kid. You always want to change the world. You never like it as it is, you're never satisfied. I'm not saying you're right, but you're not wrong. At least, when I was a kid, to hold my pants up, I didn't need a belt and suspenders! So what? There you go! Suspenders and a belt, that's a guy who's afraid of losing his pants. That kind of guy won't change the world. - Do you understand? - No. You want to know something? That fire thing, when your father almost set fire to his pad. What about it? I think he did it on purpose. So that you would come back. But it didn't work. Are you kidding me? My father doesn't give a shit about me. How dumb are you? You're blinder than your father. You're an idiot. It's an honor for Monchoux municipality to welcome you all in this room. I stole them from the other band, those idiots. So? Pierre is nowhere to be found. We're screwed! This wine smells weird, no? No, Léa. Don't drink that Sarah, it's bad. Where is he, for God's sake? Did anyone see Aloys? I'll run to his house. Gus! Colinette? Stay where you are! Stop! Stop! Aloys! What the hell are you doing? We've been looking for you! Have you seen what time it is? I'm not coming, Marcus. It went too far. We need to stop everything. I will. What did you do to him? Where are you going, Aloys? Cut the crap. You're the only one who can do this right. Aloys. Are we starting soon? Soon... I'll look for them, see what they're doing. Homemade cookies. Thanks. - They're funny. - What? These biscuits are funny. What's wrong? Everyone is sick and our conductor is missing. You mean you can't play? What about the municipality's reputation? And mine? Our conductor is here! There you are. I thought... Children, don't stay... Go home. Dad? Where the hell is he? Chevrolet, do you know where he is? What about the space cookies? Gentlemen of the jury, ladies and gentlemen. I regret to inform you that we won't be able to... Dad? - Did you have cookies? - Pierre... You were right to sell the land. But stay a bit longer with us, please. Damn it! Stop or I'll shoot! Shit. My uncle. Vito. Barbara. My mother. Beautiful! We're lucky in our misfortune. She could have married a protestant. Here you are. Would you like a cookie? This round is on me!
