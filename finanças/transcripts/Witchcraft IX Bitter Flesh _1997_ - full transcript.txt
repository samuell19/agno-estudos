MAN: Just a scumbag. He worked security for the shit heads who ran this place. Two bullets to the head. I'd say that shit head got what was coming to him. Hey, can, can, can any of you guys see me? I thought there was supposed to be two bodies here. I don't know. You know, these people seem pretty drunk around here. Maybe they're seeing double. Let's check out the rest of this place. Hey, wait. Can any of you hear me? Hello? Brenda, have you seen Will? He didn't come home last night and I didn't call. Keli. No, that's not like him. He would have called. No, he wasn't mad or anything. I'm really worried. [birds chirping] Oh, if he's fucking around on me, believe me, I'll kill him. All right, if you hear anything, let me know, all right? All right. Bye. [birds chirping] [music playing] You looking for a date, honey? MAN: Depends, what are the damages? $100 an hour. MAN: For what? Anything? No barnyard animals, OK? I'm not into that shit. Anything else is cool. What do you say, huh? MAN: Hop in. All right. HOOKER: That doesn't include the room, of course. MAN: I got the room. HOOKER: Where? MAN: A little place called The Lacey. You ever been there? HOOKER: Yeah, plenty of times. [music playing] Thanks. No problem. What did you stop the elevator for? For this. Well, don't you want to go back up to your room? Fuck the room. I want to do it right here, right now. Is that OK with you? You're the boss. At least for the next 58 minutes. [music playing] [zipper unzipping] [music playing] [sirens] WOMAN (ON POLICE RADIO): All units respond. Report of homicide at 269 Indmay Uckfay Boulevard, cross street Haggard. Detectives Lutz and Garner respond. Homicide is confirmed. I repeat, homicide is confirmed. [music playing] [panting] [moaning] [music playing] [moaning] [music playing] We called you guys right away. No one's touched a fucking thing. Jesus fucking Christ. Who found her? Found her 15, 20 minutes ago. Got a 911 call from her landlady. Said she hadn't seen her in a couple days and was worried about her. Came down here to investigate. You're a rookie? Yes, Lieutenant. Graduated from the Academy in May. Welcome aboard. [inaudible] [sighing] [ding] MAN: Thank god. WOMAN: I thought it was never going to come. [music playing] Garner, look. What? Who the fuck? Her heart's been cut out. Her body's been drained of blood. Christ all mighty. Get forensics down here. I can't take this shit. I swear this has got to be the slowest elevator. Isn't it? Anybody getting off at six? We are. [ding] Secure this place till forensics gets here. Yes sir. Sir. Have you ever seen anything like that? Not even close. Not even close. [sirens] [music playing] Champagne's over there. [glasses clinking] [pop] [music playing] Not a very pretty picture, is it? No shit. [sirens] [music playing] Well, you've only paid for an hour and uh, you've already used up about 25 minutes. So I suggest, unless you're looking for another slam bammer like the one in the elevator, you put a little money down up front. Well, time is money. So they say. Yeah. At these rates, you must be making a killing. It beats the hell out of being a secretary. Mhm. Well, for the next two hours, I'm the Chairman of the Board. Now I'd like to see a little return on my investment. I bet you were a little slut as a secretary. Hm. I was as slutty as a little slut secretary could be. Uh huh. Uh huh. I bet you fucked all your bosses too, right? Yup, I fucked them all. And sucked their cocks under their big oak desk while they talked to their wives. And then they'd take me to some sleazy cheap motel, and I fucked them till way past the time they were supposed to be home. Don't fucking tease me. Oh, why? You know you like it. Why don't you get down here and suck my cock? That I like. [sighing] First I think you ought to lick my little red fruit. [spitting] Fuck you. Those are the rules. I'm the boss and I make the rules. Uh oh. Now get down there and clean up that mess you made. No, on your knees. Like this? Crawl. [music playing] [panting] [moaning] [music playing] [moaning] [music playing] [panting] [music playing] [moaning] [music playing] [moaning] [music playing] No, no. Look, come on, Jack. Look, I'm tired. Look, I've already done 20 guys tonight, OK? Give me a break. [sighing] All right, fine. Look, tell the son of a bitch to meet me in the lobby in 20 minutes. OK? Fine. Look, I've had a long day. That's it, I'm calling it a day after that. Fine. Bye. [music playing] I want to do it somewhere where I've never done it before. So how about one of the dryers down at the laundromat? Mm? No, I can't spin around like that. I used to get sick on rides like that at the fair. Well, how about up on the roof? Ever done it on a roof before? Huh? No, that sounds pretty wild, but someone might see us. Mm, well, so what? Look, as long as we get off before the cops come-- Oh. It will be all right. [laughter] So what do you say? What the fuck, why not? [inaudible] Oh, ow. [laughter] Wait a minute. Maybe this isn't such a good idea after all. I mean, I have a wife and kids at home. What if we get caught? Oh, don't be such a chicken shit, all right? It's going to be better than any ride you've had at the county fair. [laughter] So sexy. [moaning] [distant traffic noise] [laughter] Oh, yeah. Oh jeez, if Marge saw me here right now, oh-- I bet Marge doesn't look like this. Oh no. [laughter] Well, I mean, she has tits and all but they don't look anything like this. [laughter] What the fuck is going on? Oh shit, you're a police decoy, right? Oh Christ, I saw this on "Cops". Pretty policewoman like you dressed up as a hooker, ready to pounce on guys like me. You'll parade me around like some common criminal. Oh, keep dreaming, pal, all right? OK? I'm a goddamn street walker. A hooker, a prostitute, woman of the night, a real ho of a bitch. OK? Well, I want my money back. Too bad. There's no refund policy here. Come on. I haven't even had my full hour. [scoffs] Sorry, pal. Just, just give me 50, please? [scoffs] All right, fine, fine, fine. Go buy Marge a vibrator. She's going to need one with you. OK, pal? See ya. You can hear me. I can hear you, but where are you? I'm over here, over here by the skylight. [rain and thunder] OK, I'm here. Where are you? I'm right here. [scoffs] Look, who are you? My name's Will Spanner. Oh, you're shitting me, right? Well, I know, you're, you're one of those will police decoys hidden up here somewhere on the roof. No, I'm not a cop. Trust me. -Look, right. OK. Look, if you're going to bust me, I suggest you do it now. But uh, you saw for yourself, I didn't do anything with that guy. It's not going to stick. I told you, I'm not a cop. Look, that's it. OK? I know how you guys work, what? You're, you're maybe, what? Hidden maybe down the street in a van somewhere, parked down the street. I know how it goes. Look, if I was a cop, I would have busted you a long time ago. Look, I don't know who the fuck you are, but it's been a shitty day, it's almost one in the morning, and if you're going to arrest me, I suggest you do it now. Otherwise, I'm out of here. Listen to me, you're the only one who can help me. That's it. I'm going home. See ya. [rain and thunder] Bye. Leave me alone, you freak. [ding] Look, I've been walking around this city all day and nobody can seem to see me. Leave me alone. [rain pattering] Please, you can hear me. Doesn't that mean anything to you? Yeah, but I can't see you. Yeah, but you can hear me. [music playing] [music playing] Hello? Look, I need to talk to you. You have to help me. Huh-- you scared the shit out of me. Look, I'm sorry for barging in here like this, but I need your help. How, how did you get in? Look, there are doors. What? Did you just float in there or something? I'm not going to hurt you, I just need to talk to you. You're really starting to weird me out. I mean, you're not like some weird freak or anything, are you? No. Please, you gotta help me. [laughter] You know, it's all, it's all starting to make sense now. Huh? It is? Yeah. My friend Wendy said something like this was going to happen to me. Who's Wendy? She's my girlfriend. Anyway, she, she does uh, charts and readings. Anyway, she said, she said that my planet was moving into like a strange orbit and that I would meet someone like you. You're kidding me? No. No, I'm serious. It makes perfect sense now. I was in a bad accident awhile ago up on Mulholland. I was on the back of my boyfriend's Harley and-- and anyway, I was in a coma for a couple days. Some pretty scary shit. What happened? I recovered. But I don't know how to explain it. Since then I've had these like, special powers. Special powers? Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but it's, it's like I can predict things, you know? I know they're going to happen before they do. Like, like a couple months ago, some friends of mine, they got in a car accident and the night before, I had a dream about it. Where does Wendy fit into all this? Well, she said that my astrological chart was moving into a time where I'd have greater powers. And that I'd, I'd be able to communicate with someone from a past life or another world, someone like you. It's amazing. So let me get this straight, no one can see you? Yeah. And I'm the only one that can hear you? I don't know what to do. I've lost, I've lost my job, I've lost my girlfriend. Everything. Well, what happened? You don't want to know. No, no, look, I do. I think I can help. I don't remember everything. Um-- Just tell me what happened. I remember this fight. I remember my girlfriend crying. And I guess somebody killed me. What, like a robbery? Yeah, maybe. I've lost everything and I, I don't know what to do. Look, I can help. No one can help. No, no, look, I can help. Look, first of all we need to find your girlfriend. We need to tell her what happened to you. OK? What good is that? Look, listen to me, OK? I, I, I don't know how to explain it, but I have this feeling. And it's a good feeling, and I, I know I can help you. But you have to follow me, OK? And first off, we've got to find your girlfriend. All right, all right. I'll follow you. So we have a deal then? Yeah. By the way, my name's Sheila. I'm Will. So you can see right now. Right. And you saw me back in the elevator, when I f-- Yeah. Look, you're not into any kinky shit are you? Because if you are, I'm, I'm not going to help you with this. No, believe me, that's not my main interest right now. [music playing] Look, I don't know about you but I've had a really shitty day and I could use a drink. Talk about bad days. I died today. Can't get much worse than that. So if you don't mind me asking you, Will, how is it being dead? Well, to tell you the truth, it sucks. Yeah, well, life sucks a big one too some times. I know, Sheila. But believe me, it sucks a lot worse when you're dead. You really love your girlfriend, don't you? Yeah. Yeah. I like that in a man. You know, most men, they don't know how to treat women anymore. Just assholes. First chance they get, they're off fucking their secretary. And believe me, I know. I've been the secretary. You know, I guess it just takes being a hooker to get the right perspective of men. And let me tell you, well no offense, but most men are pigs, plain and simple. Not all men are pigs I guess you have a [inaudible] view of things, being a hooker. What were you when you were alive? Teacher? [laughter] No, I was a lawyer. Oh, a lawyer. Oh, this has got to be my karma for all the, all the bad lawyer jokes I told. [laughter] Look, no offense, Will, but I need to get some shut eye and it's, it's going to be a little difficult with a ghost hanging around my apartment. I, I understand, Sheila. Look, I'll just go find some vacant house to haunt for the night. See you in the morning? OK. See ya. [music playing] Good night. Man, I gotta quit drinking so much. [music playing] Jack, what are you doing here? Come on down here. You're high again, aren't you? Little Jack is tired and broke. Uh huh, a good night, huh? You got room for me, Shi Shi? Oh yeah. I'm not in the mood, Jack. I don't give a damn about that. Now, come on, baby. [whimpering] Stop it now, come on, baby, that a girl. You got it now. Baby, come on, baby. Stop. Atta girl, atta girl. That's it, baby. Leave me alone. Baby. [whimpering] Atta girl, that's my girl. Who wants it now? Come on, baby. Stay right there. OK, baby. Right there. Come on, baby. Get it now. No. [whimpering] [grunting] [crying] [grunting] [whimpering] [grunting] [panting] Jack [inaudible] [crying] [music playing] [crying] [music playing] [crying] [music playing] It's going to be OK. [inaudible] Sh, stop crying. I can't. I hate this. I hate my life, I hate everything. I'm just a stupid whore. Don't talk like that. I thought you were supposed to be gone. I did, but I-- I sensed something was wrong so I came back. [sighing] You sure you weren't just watching us fuck? [scoffs] No, I wasn't watching you. And I'm supposed to believe a lawyer? A dead one at that? Why am I going to lie to you? Maybe I should just come back, like we agreed on. Tomorrow morning. Will, wait. Will, are you still there? Will? I'm still here. Look, um, if don't mind, I'd kind of like it if you, you stayed the night. OK. If your boyfriend shows up, I'll have to scare the holy shit out of him. He's not my boyfriend. He's my pimp. Even more the reason. Go to sleep, Sheila. Be thankful for something, that you're still living. [music playing] [footsteps approaching] Her name was Diane Shaw, just turned 27. Aspiring actress who worked in rock videos, commercials and shitty movies to pay the rent. Who found her? A janitor. I know it doesn't look it, but they actually clean this place sometimes. This way. Oh, god, it's freezing. They used to store meat in here, so the janitor said they still keep it cold. Something about it's too expensive to change the system. Shit. I don't know what to make of this. It's just like the other one. Yeah, it is. Same thing you see on the back of a dollar bill. Maybe this guy's got a beef for the IRS? Or maybe he's just a fucking weirdo. [music playing] [background chatter] What the Egyptians brought to the Hellenic world, besides, of course, the latest and most sophisticated advances in weaponry was mathematics, calculus and astronomy. In a word, culture. The Egyptians, they brought new life to a world that was fast decaying. They reinvigorated the lives of the Greeks and the Phoenicians. OK, that's it for today. I want you to read the next chapter and I will see you all on Wednesday. [background chatter] Professor Shannon? Yes? I'm Detective Lutz and this is Detective Garner. How are you? Nice to meet you. Thank you for taking the time to see us today. Great. Why don't we talk in my office? OK. Now how is it that you think a little professor of Egyptian paleontology can help you? We're investigating a series of murders. I don't know what to make of all this. These, they're rather graphic. My god. I'm sorry. No, no. I'm OK. The first woman was murdered on Monday night, the other one last night. It may not be anything, but I thought you might know what these mean. Now, they were on the necks of both victims. Interesting. May I keep these? Please. The drawings on the wall, the heart's cut out, the strange markings on the victim's necks, we don't know what we got here, Professor. It's all very disturbing. We may be dealing with some psychopath on the loose committing ritualistic murders. Or, maybe the case of a disgruntled medical student, a goddamn butcher, or just some freak who gets his rocks off slicing up women's hearts. I know it's a long shot, but anything you can help us with we'd appreciate. I'll look these over. Thanks. Keli is not going to be able to see or hear me, so I'm going to tell you what to say to her, OK? Look, Will, she's not going to believe me, for Christ's sakes. No, she'll believe you. Trust me on this. Now, tell her, um, tell her I'm OK. I'm, I'm not in my body, but I'm OK. OK, look, look Will, I, I don't want to tell you this but look, I've, I've had this vision since I was in that accident a while back. And last night I saw Keli's face in it. I, I, I think she's in danger. I-- WILL: Tell me, tell me more about this dream. Look, I, I don't know. I don't what to tell you. I, I just, I see Keli and she's in a very dark place with a lot of candles and there's a man there, but he's wearing a hood so I can't see his face. Tell Keli about the dream. She'll know what to do. OK, I'll tell her. Jesus Christ, how much farther is this? My feet are starting to hurt. Well, we're right over here. Phew. Good. OK. So this is your place, huh? Well, it used to be. Nice. [door squeaks] [explosion] [gasps] [knocking] [explosion] [whimpering] Shit. [door slams] [door rattles] Keli? Keli? Keli? Keli? Keli? Is anybody here? [music playing] Keli? Keli? Keli? Keli? Crap. [banging] Keli, stop. I'm here, I'm still alive. Oh, baby. [growling] [moaning] [panting] [moaning] [music playing] MAN: Oh great, Kofu, Master of Evil, Descendant of Satan, rise from a rock. Ally of the eternal sun. Together we shall usher in a new reign of darkness and death, hatred and fear. [moaning] MAN: Oh Great Kofu, I beseech you. Accept these gifts from your humble servant. Two hearts that I have plucked for you from the young. Let this bitter flesh revive your lust and hatred of all things human. [music playing] [traffic noise] You got something for us, professor? I've discovered the writings on the victim's neck. What do they say? I don't know, but what I do know is that it's written in hieroglyphics. What? Hieroglyphics, it's the earliest form of writing. The Egyptians used it. You see, they used pictures and symbols to represent words. There were no letters. There were over 50 different forms of hieroglyphics. There's really no way to decipher or translate them. I mean, at best we can translate maybe eight or nine versions, but I don't know if we can translate this one. Well, what about these women with their hearts cut out? Doesn't that mean anything to you? You're the experts on that. You tell me. We've hit a brick wall. Look, this could be anything. I mean, this could be some sexual perversion, this could be a violent psychopath. I mean, for god's sakes, for all we know, it could be some poor slob that flunked out of medical school. [sighs] What makes this different is the writings. I mean, Jeffrey Dahmer cut out the heart, but he didn't leave these inscriptions. What are you driving at? Go back to 1,500 BC. That's the first recorded time in history where the Egyptians started building tombs and burying their kings and Pharaohs. Yeah? There was an elite class that quickly grew up to service these pharaohs, and they were trained to embalm and then bury the kings. And they made a lot of money and they amassed considerable power in a short amount of time. You trying to make a connection here? PROFESSOR: I don't know detective, but something tells me that there might be a connection. Go on, PROFESSOR: So these men would remove all the vital organs from the Pharaohs. They believed that this would preserve the bodies longer. 1,000 years later, we realize that this is true. And you think-- PROFESSOR: Wait, let me finish. These men would go on with their business and they taught these skills to their sons, and as each up grew in their power and influence, tombs became larger and larger. The pyramids. Right. And then it happened. There was this terrible massacre outside of the Great Pyramid's at Giza. And these embalmers, they went on a rampage, killing and raping and doing all sorts of unspeakable acts. Why? No one knows. I mean, some recent historians have said it's because of the carbon dioxide in the pyramids where these men used to work for many hours a day. Other say it's because of political uprising against the Pharaohs because of their corruption and power. But we do know this, shortly thereafter, the Egyptians stopped making the pyramids and then became their slow, irreversible decline from greatness. Something tells me that you don't buy that. Well, around the same time there was this small religion, a cult really, that grew up outside of Cairo. And it was made up of the same men who used to work in the pyramids. And what they would do is they believed that the Egyptians had angered the gods. And In their pyramids, instead of showing man's superior knowledge, they represented man's ego, and vanity, and pride. So they used their skills to kill and disembowel many of the members of the upper strata of society. They believed that they were appeasing the gods. So needless to say, the authorities quickly gathered them up and executed them. But it's believed that many of them escaped and went to Rome and to Spain. And that this cult grew for another 200 years and didn't die out until around the time of Christ's birth. So if it died out, than what's the problem? That's the problem. Many scholars believe that it never died out. What are you saying? PROFESSOR: I have a friend that works at Yale and he believes that there's members of this cult that are still around today. In-- in Los Angeles? In 1996? I mean, we'd have some weird stuff going down here, but a religious cult that rips out women's hearts? I don't know, detective. But your killer's obviously very sick. And unlike most killers, he has specialized skills and knowledge. He can cut with the precision of a surgeon, and he can write hieroglyphics with the knowledge of a scholar. So we canvas the medical schools and colleges looking for this freak. I can give you the names of the people who know this language. I mean, there can't be more than 50 or 60 of them in the whole world. Thanks. [sighing] You're welcome. Thanks for the tip. Glad I could be of help. Thank you. [phone ringing] So you don't buy it? Not a word. She seems like a bright woman but I think she's got a couple of screws loose. And you've got a better theory? Last week two women killed, both with their hearts cut out. Yeah. I think the killer's some scrawny little white guy who lives with his mother, probably out in the valley. His mother thinks he's a good little boy, but in the basement he's got a room full guns and a big stack of porno magazines. Just some sick fuck with a really bad sex life and a shitty attitude. You're wrong. You know how we solve this case? How's that? A year from now, a cop pulls over a crappy van for running through a red light. The guy in the van panics and says how he likes to cut up women's hearts. Cop says, why do you do that? And the guy says because when he was three years old, he saw his dad naked or something. You never cease to amaze me. [laughter] What do you got for me on the big case? We have two dead girls, one found in Westwood, one found in Hollywood, both in the 20's. Aspiring actresses on both, with their hearts cut out. You're yanking my chain. No we're not. [sighing] Unbelievable. Any leads? We're working on the case right now for you, Captain. Yeah, we've been working with a-- what is her name? DETECTIVE LUTZ: Shannon. Professor Shannon, at SC, she thinks that the killer might be a medical student, or a doctor, or someone in the medical profession. Why is that? He cuts like a pro, sir. [music playing] [phone ringing] [music playing] You look tired. I am. Want some tea? That's not going to do any good. What's gotten into you lately? What are you talking about? Well, I mean, one minute you're a dynamo and the next minute you look like you have one foot in the grave. You should see a doctor. Fuck the doctors. You've really changed, maybe you should see a psychiatrist. Go fuck yourself, bitch. You've really changed, Will. You've really changed and I'm scared. [dishes clatter] [music playing] [phone ringing] SHEILA: Detective Garner? Yeah, that's me. I have some information I think you might find useful. Sweetheart, everybody's got some information they think I might need. I'm a busy man. You know what? I cannot get your pimp out of jail. Look, I'm not a hooker, detective. Ah, congratulations, I've gotta go though. Look, I need your help. I don't have time. Will Spanner said to contact you. I do not have time for Will Spanner right now. No, no, no. Let her talk. Look, Will said to talk to you, that, that his girlfriend Keli was in trouble. I'm not a bodyguard. And you tell Will Spanner, last time he helped us out on a case, it did not turn out so hot. What kind of trouble? Look, it's kind of hard to explain really. Let's blow this chick off. She's wasting our time. No. I want to hear what she has to say. She's a flake. You've been busted before. Didn't I bust you a couple years ago down on Sunset Boulevard? What did Will tell you? Look, it's really weird shit. Goodbye. Look, he told me to talk to you, that, that you'd understand. He said that the curse had been broken and that it was, it was more powerful and stronger than ever. What else? What else did he tell you? He, he told me to tell you what I saw. And what did you see? [sighing] At Keli's house, I, I saw a man in the basement. What did he look like? I couldn't tell, he was wearing a hood. Well, do you have a name? I didn't actually meet him. Like, I think maybe his name was Keifer, Kaufer, Kofu maybe. Kofu. Kofu. Yeah, I think that was his name. Well, where's Will now? Well, he's in, uh, hiding, sort of. That's why he asked me to contact you. So this guy Kofu, he's the one that's been threatening Will and Keli? Yes, I think so. CAPTAIN: You think so? What the hell are you saying? You want us to arrest some fat guy named Kofu because Will Spanner doesn't like him? Look, he scares me. Has he been threatening you? No, it's just, I'm, I'm really scared. Look, I know you think I'm crazy or I'm full of shit, but look, you got to believe me. I saw this guy with-- With what? [sighs] He was in the, he was, he was in the basement in Keli's house in front of this altar in the middle of the room with, with a-- With what? You have to tell me what he had. Please, you have to tell me. With a goddamn human heart. He was holding it in his hand like it was a piece of candy. I got to go, I got to go. Have you notified the newspapers, radio, TV about these murders? No, nothing. Why? Because we got a witness. The hooker? She saw this guy Kofu holding a heart in his hand. In Will Spanner's basement? If this hasn't been in the papers or anything yet, she's telling the truth. We got to keep her under wraps. Get her down to the print artist. We need to make a sketch on this guy and then we'll let her go. Let her go? Yeah, we'll get an ID on the freak and then we'll try to match fingerprints, DNA, hair fibers, anything that puts him at the crime scene. I don't want to let this son of a bitch walk. [music playing] [sighing] What are you here, Jack? Just checking my property. Look, I'm not your property anymore. OK, I'm on my own. Gee, I remember when you didn't have any money. Oh shit, how long ago was that? Too long. You were turning $40 tricks in the back of pick-up trucks, down on Western. $10 blow jobs at grocery store parking lots. What do you want from me, Jack? Well, you see, I have this friend, nice girl, really. Does, turns one to two tricks a week max. Yeah, you see, she got busted this afternoon and they took her downtown, police headquarters. I don't know what you're talking about. Well, you see, my whore friend thinks you were narking on me. And, and, and I says, no. Not my Shi Shi. But then I saw your car downtown and I gots to thinking-- you're not wearing a wire now, are you baby? Because if you are and you're thinking of turning me in, I'm here to say it's not cool. Not cool at all. I wasn't there to talk about you, Jack. Bullshit. You making a habit of paying social calls to police headquarters? Are, are you fucking some boy scout in blue? Stop it. Leave me alone. Get out of here, you bastard. Not a good idea at all. Stop it. Stop it, leave me alone. We had a-- I'll fucking kill you. Oh-- I'll fucking kill you, Jack. -Yeah. -Stop it. [coughing] Sheila-- Will, Will, is that you? Sheila. He's going to kill me. Please help me. -How? What can I do? Please do something quick before he kills Crazy fucking bitch, talking like that. Who the fuck you talking to? Your little boyfriend? He can't help you. He can't help you. [whooshing] Now baby-- what are you doing? You deal with that? Ah. [grunting] [moaning] Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [slamming] Sorry piece of shit. If you ever touch me or another fucking woman again, I'll kill you, bastard. [panting] Yeah, thanks for your help, Will. But now if you don't mind, I'd kind of like you to get out of my body. WILL: I need to ask a big favor of you, Sheila. What? WILL: I need to stay in your body just little while longer, if you don't mind. Yeah, I've heard that before from a trick but-- WILL: Please Sheila, I need to be in your body to get into my apartment. Whoever's behind this has a force field around my building that keeps me from entering it. Keli thinks that whoever's in my body is me, I've got to get in there and help her. Hell if I'm going to go back to your place. You know, there's some weird shit going on down there in your basement. WILL: Please Sheila, if you don't do this for me, my girlfriend is really fucked. All right. I guess I do owe you one for helping me beat the shit out of Jack. Hey baby, you don't look so good. Maybe I could make you feel better. [music playing] [moaning] [music playing] Oh yeah, baby. Yeah baby, give it to me. [panting] [moaning] [music playing] Oh yeah. Oh yeah, Will. Yes. [moaning] Oh god, give it to me. Give it to me. Oh yeah, Oh. [moaning] You're hurting me, Will. [whimpering] [music playing] [car engine starts] [music playing] In the name of Kofu come forward and begin the transmogrification. But you have already been transmogrified. I know, but my body is weak. I want a new one. I want this one. This one has been sullied by your seed. But at least it is strong. It is better to be in the body of a whore than be trapped in the body of a wounded, dying man. Who are you? Don't be afraid. I am a friend. Will, who is this? This is the undertaker. You're the one that should have seen the doctor. Do something, Will. Will, please help me. Fuck you. KOFU: Will Spanner is dead. Finito. Gone. Dust in the wind. And this, this Will, he's really not your Will He is just using Will's body temporarily. You're a liar. You're a lying piece of shit. KOFU: Don't you ever, ever talk to me like that again. Prepare her for our little sacrifice. Will, please, don't. Don't you understand English? Like he said, your Will is gone. KOFU: Convenient, isn't it? He's using Will's body to trick you. You're sick. OK Will, you ready? WILL: All right, let's go kick some ass. Will. KOFU: You see, before your Will died he left you something. Something that I want very badly. He left you his power. His power as a good warlock. That power shall be mine-- [laughter] KOFU: And is-- You'll never get away with this. [evil laughing] [screaming] Hey, which apartment was Spanner's? 202. Right, 202. KOFU: You are my God. You give me my power and my strength. I have you given you the flesh and blood of many beautiful young woman. Please accept this sacrifice. Look at this place. Didn't Spanner used to live in a big house over on Harvard? Yeah, and when was the last time you ever saw him win a case? Well, maybe if he'd stop chasing monsters. [laughter] [door squeaks] What the hell is this? Fucking van Gogh suite? Maybe Spanner's on acid. Maybe that's why he's so fucking weird. Come on. Let's go check out the basement. Oh fuck. [thudding] [groaning] [music playing] [groaning] [thudding] KOFU: On more move and I'll slit her throat. SHEILA: All right, all right. Just, just don't hurt her, please. I'm, I'm giving up. Jack. God damn you, Shi Shi. What the fuck? You got to go and ruin everything. LA PD , put your fucking hands up. Stop asshole. Drop the sickle now. Stay there, copper. I'm going to cut her. I'll cut her good. I mean it, copper. Jackie's going to slice her. Drop her. Yeah, and I'm going to like it too. I'm going to enjoy it, baby. Stay away, copper. I'm telling you. Stay back. I'm not fooling, am I, baby? Oh, Jackie likes it. DETECTIVE GARNER: asshole. [fire crackling] [screaming] [yelling indistinctly] [fire crackling] I wish we could get rid of all scum this easily. It isn't as easy as skimming petri dishes in high school, Garner. If it was, we'd have a scum-less society. Hey, wouldn't that be something? Yeah. But you and me, we'd be out of a job. Yeah. [music playing] [groaning] Will, is it really you? Yeah. [music playing] [inaudible] [wind howling] [music playing]
