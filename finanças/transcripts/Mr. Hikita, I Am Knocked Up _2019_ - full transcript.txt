BASED ON "The Hikita's Are Expecting!" BY Kunio HIKITA Sachi? What are you doing? Get up, will you? Breakfast? Just tea. Good morning. Sugiura? Why are you here? - May I have more rice, please? - Sure. - Not too much. - Not too much? It seems I drank too much at the third bar. Not that I remember. I'm sorry. How can Sugiura ask for seconds at someone's house? Uh, how did I get home? I'm sorry. I'll have dinner when I get home tonight. Okay. Are you going to make that deadline on time? I need some sleep first. See ya. Hey, this is my new book. Maybe you can read it on your way to work. "Braggart Surfer" - Bye. - See you later. - I'm home. - Hey. Hungry? Nah, I must work. It'll make me sleepy. You sure you want to drink now? Just one can. - Good luck. - I'll do my best. You pulled them all out again? Yup, every single one. Do you want to listen to it again? I can't believe you're a mom. You said you never want kids. You've got plasters all over your fancy chair. Aren't you coming back to work yet? One of our designers just quit. No, it's too early. Oh, come on. I know you said you don't want kids either. But you won't believe it. Raising a kid is so much fun. Yeah sure. She puts a plaster on the scratch on a wall, saying the wall is hurt. All over the TV too. Mommy? Is this water? Check this out. She's practicing how to smile like a drawing. Oopsy. I know what to do. Oh? Thank you. - You made me better? - Yep. I want snacks. When you get home, okay? - Snacks. - You'll have to wait. You can have your favorite gummy bears at home. I want it now! Not too loud. I want snacks! - When you get home, okay? - We'll get home soon. You'll get some at home. Hello there, young mister. Let me guess what you want. You wanna eat a snack, huh? Bowl of noodles coming right up. This one is for Dad. Dad? That idiot... Let it go. - This is a limited edition. - It is? Very unique. Good evening. - So light. - Right? I could eat this nonstop. Do you know what Sugiura's nickname in junior high was? Kunio? Can you guess? Kunio. I want to see the face of your child. I thought we didn't want kids. What changed your mind? I thought... I want to see our child. We had agreed on not having children. Everything changed from that day forward. She started to take her temperature right after waking up. This way, we'd know when it's best to have intercourse. This was a method called the "timing method." Did you sleep? I snoozed. I need you later. - Breakfast? - In a minute. Okay. - More tea? - No, thank you. - And you? - Yes, please. Dear? You're keeping them waiting. It's fine. So? Sorry for bothering you. We have something to tell you. "WRITTEN BY KUNIO HIKITA" Why would he use my book to stabilize his desk? I personally sent him that. Books are for reading. Maybe he read it first. That's even worse. So what if he's a professor? He totally ignored the topic about having kids. Why do we need to ask for his permission, anyway? This is about us. Couldn't he have gone to the hardware store? They sell those rubber thingies. I should send him one. "Bloom To Death Flower" This manuscript is superb. How should I put it? It's brimming with anger, and I can empathize. Right? This may be your best work ever. That good? I think so. Definitely promising. Remember the place I told you about that serves the beer to die for? I found out the location. Let's invite some editors and check it out tonight. Not today. Want to grab a drink? - Sorry, no. - Too bad. You too? Ah, okay. You wanted to talk to me? Can you be home the day after tomorrow? Why? It's "the night." So finally? But are you sure? It's the best beer ever. You're eating watermelon alone? - Have some. - Not fair. There you go. You need salt on that. - No! I don't want any. - You've got to. - All over. - Go easy. You need minerals to stay fit in the summer. It's always the same. You need to listen to me! I know. It's not like I... You just don't think it's a big deal. You have every right to think that. You're not serious... 1st SPRING You know that you said... that the timing method has an 80% pregnancy rate. Damn right. So, that means... you get pregnant 8 out of 10 times? That's not it. If there are 10 couples, of that 10, 8 will get pregnant over the course of one year. I see, I get it now. So hot. But your wife... Oops, sorry. She's not pregnant. Why is that? It's got to do with our condition and health. Shut up. I will fan each of you starting from here. - Sachi is young and beautiful... - Shut up. I never planned on having kids. I thought you had kids. No way. This is my first marriage. Only Sachi. I'm an earnest guy. Earnest? You don't hear that word nowadays. So obsolete. The wording is not important. - So about work... - The topic is over? That series for teens. Won't you do it? I told you I don't want to write for teens. I don't write kids' stuff. What I want... Whoa. Hot! Stop! I'm talking to you. A photo of a pomegranate in your bedroom helps you get pregnant, I hear. I heard you should grow wild strawberries. Put something orange in your bedroom. My fertility rate increased when I fed peaches to my husband. Canned peaches will do. Our daughter got pregnant right after visiting the family grave. Right? You should eat rice balls made by someone pregnant. Why would you get pregnant by eating rice balls made by a pregnant woman? It's scientifically inexplicable. Or touch a pregnant woman? Is pregnancy contagious? Totally. I was craving curry, so I made naan. - You did? - Yeah. - Cool. - Let's eat it Indian style. It'll get cold. Hurry. Hurry along. Chop chop. There you go. Wow, what a feast. Let's eat. Let's eat. Here. - What's this? - I had a checkup. - Check up? - Yeah. - You okay? - Yeah. Yum. This is so good. It sure is. It's not too spicy. Just right. Well... If we can't, it's okay to not have kids. You know? Just us. Amazing. My results came up fine. They want your semen in this and brought to the clinic at nine o'clock. Should I help? Excuse me, I'm eating. Are you okay with the time? Why didn't you ask me? Nine in the morning? That's what I said. So out of the blue. I want a spoon. Don't you? How am I supposed to put it in here? What? Don't get any on the sides for hygiene reasons. Actually, will you give me a hand? Sure, let me dry my hair first. Meet you in bed. And remember to knock! Sachi? You said you'd help me. I guess I'm on my own. - Morning. - Hey. Sorry about that. Did you manage it? Barely made it. How did you get it in? Don't ask me that. Everything is so high-tech these days yet this is so old school. Thanks. See you later. They should make it wider. You know. "TAKAHARA OB/GYN CLINIC" - Excuse me. - Yes? The analysis... What?! - I'm here for the sperm analysis. - I see. Right, a sperm analysis! Please wait. - Thank you. - Take care. "TWO-HOUR WAIT!" "SO UNCOMFORTABLE" "POOR YOU!" "SEND ME A PHOTO, LOL" Mr. Hikita. Please come in. Mr. Hikita, are you ready to hear this? Why? Your sperm motility is only 20%. What does that mean? 80% are not moving. The rest aren't in great condition either. In general, you need over a 40% motility rate to get pregnant. Your results are not promising. Must you go that far to have children? Children are god-sent blessings. They'll come to you when it's meant to be. Even if you get pregnant how old would he be when the child turns 20? You've got to think things through. Whoa, I didn't see you. What's wrong? You're not going to believe it. Huh? My motility is 20%. Huh? 80% of my sperm is not moving. I looked myself. Why are they not moving? Are you sick? I've "matured." Like curry? I'm getting too old. Too old?! That clinic can't do further tests, so they'll refer us to another clinic. Right. I sure am 49 years old, but I work out. From esophagus to anus, all came up clean in my last health check too. - It did. - Right? This must be a mistake. It might be someone else's. A mistake at the clinic? That must be it. - You think? - Shitty clinic. Yeah? - Even the receptionist was bitchy. - Yeah? - Calm down. - But it must be a mistake. I'm 49, but I work out every day. From head to anus, my health check was perfect! Mr. Hikita, please calm down. I did a gastrocamera, and it was all clean. I see. The timing method didn't work? Let's redo the tests for now. Starting with you. But they said she's fine. Yes, but let's start by running more detailed tests on both of you. I'll do it. We'll be running these tests on you. We'll do a transvaginal ultrasound, blood works, and a pap smear. The results of the ultrasound will be out today, the blood work next week, and the pap smear about two weeks later. Then, timed with your cycle, we'll do the following. Hydrotubation. Hysterosalpingography. Ultrasound. Urine hormone evaluation. Blood hormone evaluation. Finally, a Huehner test. For Mr. Hikita is this. A sperm analysis. - That's it? - Yes. - Really? - Yes. If you could come with me. Sure. Thank you. Later. This way? I'll explain the procedure. - Please follow me. - Okay. Right, then. Please fill this up. Here is your room. "MEN'S ROOM" "MEN ARE TREATED SO ROUGHLY" Are you done? My home is close. I'll do this at home. You will? Well, whatever works best for you. And so our infertility treatment began. Sperm released from the body must be handled with care. Freshness is key. The motility decreases after three hours. Mr. Hikita, are you ready to hear this? If you are going to carry it in a container keep it near body temperature, or the motility will decrease. That must be it. Keep it at body temperature? - I told you to knock. - I did. You open too quickly after the knock. Why can't you do it at the clinic? Men are sensitive. Anyone would say they can't cum in a clinic just like that. Did you want something? The best way to keep it warm is to carry it in a bra. A bra? I see. Will you do it? I guess. The test is at nine, so I'll have it ready by eight. Will you...? I forgot I had to go to work early today. Good luck at the clinic. - Hey. - Hi. - Dinner's ready. - Really? Thanks. So, how was it? I almost turned myself in when I passed a cop. You really wore my bra? I mean, you could have put it up your shirt without using a bra. All you have to do is keep it at body temperature. - You wore it? - Knock it off. I have a good feeling. - You do? - Yeah. Totally, I'm confident. Your results are good. See? I told you so. I knew it. Let's move on to the next test. Okay. As for you, Mr. Hikita. "SPERM MOTILITY 20%" No... 20%? You're kidding. There. These are your sperm. As you can see, many of them aren't moving. 20%... This doesn't grade you or anything. It's only about your sperm. The numbers can be affected by your daily conditions. So whether they get left out on the counter or carefully carried to the clinic in a bra, it makes no difference? It does. The semen should be kept at body temperature. So maybe last time, the motility was 50% but dropped to 20% while it was left out on the counter? That could be possible. In a bra? Well, uh... Never mind that. All I can tell you is, I recommend artificial insemination. You tried the timing method for a year already. Artificial insemination? What do you say? Wait, I don't know how I feel about it yet. Many people think of test tube babies. It's different? With artificial insemination, the collected sperm are inserted into the uterus using a pump. To collect the most active sperm, the semen is put in a centrifuge. The woman will take ovulatory medication to increase follicles and progesterone to improve the receptivity of the uterine lining. To put it bluntly, it's when the doctor pumps the best sperm collected from my semen into her the uterus. How do you choose the active sperm? The sperm are first condensed in a centrifuge. Then comes the Swim-up method. Swim-up Method? A culture medium is poured into sperm. We assume the sperm that swims up is active. So the sperm is drowned, and some swim up. Only those who swim up are chosen. What a simple way to name a medical procedure. Shall we try it? - Mrs. Hikita. - Yes. Wait here. Hold this for me. Honey, everything looks good. Really? How wonderful. Who's a good baby? Shall we go? I'm getting hungry. You are? Shall we grab a bite? I guess it's fair. No matter your age or occupation. No matter how hard you try or don't try. Whether you want a child or not, it doesn't matter. Some get pregnant. Others never will. How much more fair could it get? I guess so. We've been trying for six years. Six? We keep hoping that the next time is the charm. We haven't been able to give up. It's been a long road. My wife and I decided that today is our last attempt. Oh yes. You should ice your balls. Ice them. Ready to go? Sachi? I'm sorry for failing you. Don't apologize. It's not you. It's your sperm. Let's do the artificial insemination. Yeah, let's do it. So my best sperm will be chosen by centrifugation, so it'll be like an all-star team. Wait, they're only the better of the useless. It's like buying something of high cost at a cheap shop. I think you're worth more than that. Let's do this. Yeah, let's do this. A test tube baby? How futuristic. You've got it wrong. How could a baby grow in a test tube? The collected sperm is inserted into the uterus using a pump. That's rather direct. Right? What if the baby doesn't look like you? You idiot. Why would that happen when we are using our own sperm and egg? I'm going to have a baby. I'm not giving up until I do. Excuse me. Thank you. Wait, is Yoko pregnant? Yes. Four months pregnant. She started trying last year. I had no idea. Meanwhile, this guy here hasn't for five years. Hasn't what? As a writer you should read between the lines. With my wife. Really?! For five years?! Why are you still married? Well uh... We don't have the urge, and we don't want kids. So you can if you want? Yes, we've been checked. You should do it. You're married. We haven't talked about the design at all. I'm not sure about this font. - Oh yeah. - What now? I'm embarrassed to say this. My wife is this, you know... Wait, your wife was pregnant just a while ago. Yeah, she was. That's why it's tough. We have been using protection. I don't understand how it happened. Three kids in this bad economy? It's not easy. Three kids? Minister of Impregnation, Shunichi Sugiura. MINISTER OF IMPREGNATION SHUNICHI SUGIURA I have never tried to impregnate my wife on purpose. Liar. As far as I am concerned, we have been using protection. Do you know what protection is? - It's on purpose. - Admit it! Minister of Useless Balls. Kunio Hikita. MINISTER OF USELESS BALLS KUNIO HIKITA - What is it? - Nothing. That dirt bag... Oh? What brings you here? Thanks for the other day. What's going on? A test tube baby? We came as fast as we could. We've decided on it. - I forbid it. It's disgraceful. - Stop it. Wait a second. What do you mean, disgraceful? What's disgraceful about wanting our own child? Stop trying to conceive using crazy human experimentation. Human experimentation? You're just ignorant. Many couples have kids this way. Stop... Don't judge us because of your ignorance. Watch your mouth. Test tube baby? You are clueless. Study before you criticize. I don't care. You are to stop now. We've made up our minds. This is not your business. We decided together. Sachi! You must stop this disgrace at once. Sweetie? Say something. How do you feel about this? You tell him. You are to think things over. I will. You said you would let them talk first. Why do you have to be like that? Enough. With artificial insemination, we will make a child without having sex. I think it's going to be harder than we think. Still... I want our baby. That's why I want to try it. You can decide for us. You sure? Great. Let's nail it on our first try. - Yeah. - Good. Good. Short and sweet. Sachi had been charting her temperature for a year. Our first insemination was on our wedding anniversary. "ICE PACK" Something you can do? Yes. If we collect your semen in the clinic, your sperm will be fresher. It'll increase your chances. - I'm ready. - Coming. We find out the results when Sachi menstruates two weeks later. Oh yeah. Mr. Hikita? Uh... There's a request for a short story for product promotion. Not interested? No, not interested. I thought so. "NO LUCK" - Hey. - Hi. It's our first time. We can't be that lucky. I guess so. I'll be working. What's for dinner? I felt like ginger pork stir-fry. Nice. Call me when it's ready, It's only our first time. You can do this. It's only our second time. It's been a month already? What? No good again? It's only been your third try. It's said to take five to eight attempts. After that, we'll have to move on to the next step. You still have five attempts to go. What are these figures based on? It's usually said to be about eight times. About? Then, how can I make my sperm better? How? It can differ according to your condition. That's all you say. The problem is my sperm. I heard carnitine helps. It can differ according to your health. So I should be in better health? How should I get healthy? What should I eat? Do I exercise? Get more sleep? There's got to be a way. - It's your health. - I am healthy. I've had enough! Hurry up and walk. Get up! Why can't you do as Mommy tells you? Hold on to your toy! Don't cry! Stop crying! Just one sperm digs into an egg. An egg is fertilized, and a child is born. That is already a divine miracle. Just one sperm. That's right. Just one. I only need one strong sperm to dig into the egg and fertilize it. Just one, that's all I need. Just one. Just one. That's all. "Infertility Treatment" "SAY NO TO USELESS BALLS!" All I can do is ice my balls and put up photos of pomegranates. I'll do it. I'll do everything I can. Just one. Only one! "CANNED PEACH" "SAUNAS NOT RECOMMENDED" "NO SAUNAS" "EARLY TO BED AND EARLY TO RISE" "MODERATE EXERCISE" "NOTE TO DRINKING" "NO ALCOHOL" "IMPROVE SPERM TIPS" "BOXERS ARE BETTER THAN BRIEFS" "WEAR BOXERS" "CAROTENE" "NO ALCOHOL" "SPERM MOTILITY 38%" "FASTING" Taste good? It's cold? Yes? Isn't it cold? Good, huh? Mr. Hikita. I know you're on a fasting but you're making us feel awkward. Please eat. Or leave. Good? "SPERM MOTILITY 25%" "SAY NO TO USELESS BALLS!" "WEAR BOXERS" "NO ALCHOHOL" "VitaminA" "VitaminC" "CAROTENE" Kunio? Kunio, come on. Do you have protection? No. Don't you? Of course not. But it's safe today. No way. You'll get pregnant. I'll go buy some. - Seriously? - Of course. I don't want kids. It'll be fine. You idiot! You have no idea! Don't barge into the past! Every month I pray to get pregnant. You don't want kids? You idiot! Go away. I'm about to get lucky. Hey, you have a condom? - Idiot! - Get off me! I have pomegranates all over my wall! Not my problem! Hang on, sugar! You're mighty strong! Mr. Hikita? Mr. Hikita? Are you listening? "SPERM MOTILITY 70%" What? I did it? 70%? I did it! Hell yeah! I did it. It's the highest yet. This has got to do it. Right? It's 70%. Tell them to handle it with care. Okay? Nurse, please handle it with extra care. - Of course. - I'm counting on you. All right. - In here please. - Good luck. On to the next round! No. I'm late. Congratulations. Hell yeah! We did it! 2nd SPRING We saw the sonogram pictures today. A tiny baby was there. That's right. No, we'll only see the heartbeat in two weeks. How wonderful. Congratulations. Thank you. How's Dad? When he heard about the baby, he locked himself in his study. I'm sure he's happy. Is that so? Tell him I said thank you. I will. You take care. I will. See you. Bye now. They're both happy. They are? Beer? I'm thirsty too. - Sit down. Sit down. - I can do it. - I insist. - I'll do it. Please. What do you want to drink? Some kind of juice. Tomato juice? So good. You're drinking over a sonogram picture? - Want to see? - I did. I did. Take a good look. Cute right? It's a call from Sachi. What's up? I'm not sure. The baby. The heart isn't moving. Don't cry. We'll keep trying. Here, wipe up. Eat. Let's eat. It's good. It's hot. Don't spill. - I'll eat at home. - Okay. - See you. - Bye. What? Of course she's not okay. No, Sachi is so strong. She's amazing. Are you sure? Should I fix this? Where? Yeah, you've used similar phrases. Ah, okay. - Hi. - Hello. - I'd like two Daikon. - Sure. Two beef tendons. Two Konjac too. I'm home. Sachi? Sachi? Sachi. "I DON'T HAVE USELESS BALLS!" Please come in. - Doctor. - How are you? Wait. I think you should begin to consider ICSI. Come again? Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection. What? Why? With ICSI, we take the sperm that can't swim to the egg and directly inject it into the egg on a Petri dish. But the cost and stress on your wife become higher. Hang on. We were successful once. Recently, artificial insemination is counted in sets of six. You've done twelve. Considering your motility, I recommend that you move on. You said eight times just the other day. Whether it's six or eight, those are just statistics. It's not going to dictate us. "TOTAL COST: 400,000 YEN" Pricey. It is. It's expensive. Very expensive. For just one time? Is this price appropriate? In the end, we decided to try our 13th artificial insemination. I'm off. I might eat out with Sugiura. Okay. Don't you think 400,000 yen is expensive? With that much money you can go see the northern lights in Alaska. Stop texting and listen. Sorry. I didn't see the point in listening. You should. Uh... What? She's pregnant. What? But you just had a baby. Well... It's my mistress. You're kidding? You really are the minister of insemination. I'm sorry about the timing. That's okay. I'm sorry, congrats. It's congratulations, right? Of course it is. A baby is a miracle. Sure, but I can't be happy about it right now. I was being so careful. Seriously. How could this happen? I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. You know... I change my mind. I'll do those promotions and stuff. Are you sure? Thank you. But offers like that don't come around all the time. Of course. - Beer, please. - Yes, sir. Are you sure? You have the insemination tomorrow. Just this one. One glass and I go home. Damn it, balls! - I want your balls. - What? Just one would do. Please! Ow, stop it. I'm back home. I didn't mean to. I know this is tough. I get that you want to make it fun. That's why I said nothing. But I've had it. Let's quit. This is tough for me too. We've tried for two years. Can't I get drunk just once? Why must we suffer so much for a baby? Sachi! Wait. Sachi... Good morning. Get out now! I told you to get going! Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection? Why are you so hell-bent on having a baby? What good will it do to make a baby through such disgrace? The reason why you're childless is because of him. Why must you be the one suffering? You are fertile. Why must you risk your healthy body to have the child of this man? If you want a child that badly, leave him. Find a man your own age. What's so disgraceful? Don't talk back to me. What's disgraceful about trying to have a baby? You don't understand anything. Stay out of this. I've had enough. I know. You're right. Kunio says he doesn't feel the age difference, but I do. He's not as young as he thinks. We don't sing or listen to the same songs. He gets tired easily, and repeats himself when he's drunk. Still... I love him. I'm trying because it's with him. I want to have his baby. I started it. No one else. I'm doing it because I want to. It's none of your business. Stop interfering. - You... - Dear! How did you know? You always splurge here when you're upset. I bought lots of pointless stuff. All things I could do without. I'm sorry. Let's go home. Want to catch a movie? Good idea. - I'm hungry. - Me too. - Let's eat. - Yeah, before the movie. 1st INTRACYTOPLASMIC SPERM INJECTION 11 mature follicles were confirmed. Sachi is under intravenous anesthesia. A transvaginal ultrasound is used to check the follicles. A needle will pierce through the vaginal wall and ovary to collect the follicle and liquid. They say there is no pain. But there is nothing wrong with Sachi. It's all because of my useless balls. But it's my wife who's on the operation table. My stupid useless balls. Are you okay? Calm down. Doc? Are there any medication to make my sperm better? Can't you inject something directly into these damn balls? Maybe some nutrition or vitamins? Stop that. I don't care if it hurts like hell. Sachi is young and fertile. It shouldn't be her. You should be doing all this to me. You can do anything. "ALL THE FOLLICLES ARE GONE NONE FERTILIZED" You see, I don't feel like giving up at all. I've overturned many things in my life. I turned around my mistakes. I changed bad luck into fortune. Tenacity is my motto. Sure, we've had nothing but bad luck. But I can feel it. Next time we can do it. In fact, I know I can because it's with you. You said you wanted to see my child's face. That's why I wanted to show it to you too. But... But... If you want to stop, that's okay too. Let's stop. - I'll make tea. - No thanks. I just had a lecture at a nearby university. Never mind me. - Still. - No. Kids these days don't have questions after lectures. They head straight home as soon as the lecture is over. They want to go to their part-time jobs. If they want to work so much, they should quit school. What's the matter? Mr. Hikita. Yes? I'll be honest with you. I don't like you. Your books. What you say. How you live. How should I put it? I just can't stand you. There is no way I will ever like you. Why did you come here? However, my daughter says she loves you. She says she wants your baby. - Mr. Hikita. - Yes. I need you to understand. I really don't want to. I really really don't want to. Okay? Money? I really don't want to. Use it as you like. - But... - Goodbye. - Dad. - Stop it. I don't want to, so... Okay? I'm going to do this. We'll have the baby and pay him back with interest. Here's a blanket. You have to keep warm. "The Giant Prime Minister" BY KUNIO HIKITA" What are you looking at? Do you prefer curry of North India, South India or Thailand? You changed the topic. So, North Indian curry? 2nd INTRACYTOPLASMIC SPERM INJECTION How many eggs? One. I see. But... I think this is the one. Sachi. Thanks for putting up with me. We did what we could. - Let it work. - Please. The yellow here is a bit weak. Is it hard to see? "SACHI" Excuse me. Hello? Got it. It worked. The egg was fertilized. You did it. I'm so happy. Why are you crying before I do? I'm so happy for you. Mr. Hikita, congratulations. It's a miracle. Mr. Hikita, you did it. "CONSULTING ROOM" Mrs. Hikita. You're pregnant! Congratulations. Thank you so much. I'm pregnant. You are? - I'm so happy for you - Thank you. Congratulations. - You went through so much. - Thank you. Congratulations. Thank you. Excuse us. Just one. Just one egg. It took in my sperm. Now it has begun to divide. Here you go, ma'am. Soy sauce soup for the dad. Yes, Dad wants the soy sauce soup. I'm a dad. Dad wants another beer. - Beer for Dad. - Coming right up. Let's dig in. All right. Yum. It'll be okay this time, won't it? Of course. We'll be fine. - Beer for Dad. - Beer for Dad. 3rd SPRING See you. Bye. Maybe the paper can be thinner. But the words will show through on the other side. - Oh yeah. - Knocked up again? Of course not. That's not funny. That's not it. Here. Isn't it her second trimester? It's too early for presents. - Thank you. - My pleasure. Congratulations. - How cute. - Aren't they tiny? "SACHI" Let me get this. Sachi? We did a sonogram. It's the baby's head. There's a bubble. This is a choroid plexus cyst. It could be a chromosome abnormality. Sometimes it disappears naturally. It'll go away. Make the bubble go away. I'll give you all my luck. Please. Make it go away. I beg you. Time for my checkup. I'll come with you. It's okay. You have a deadline to meet. I'll call you. See you. Bye. The phone you are calling cannot be reached. Please leave a message after the tone. The Hikita's Are Expecting!
