It's gotta be more legible, alright, darling? Yes, L?cia. Russ?o, don't leave yet, I gotta talk to you, okay? Listen, people. This is Juliana, I'd like to introduce her to you. She'll be starting with us on Monday. - What's up? - How are you? - How you doin'? - Fine. - Welcome! - Thanks. On Monday I'll introduce you better individually, we're short on time today. But this is Russ?o, I told you about him. He's been here for a while now. Okay, Juliana, so we'll get started on Monday. - You'll be in his team, okay? - Alright. - Me? My team? - Yes, your team. The girl has labyrinthitis. Isn't that what you told me? That's right. So, if she collapses on the street, you can carry her. Okay? And I'll get the papers to management on Monday... don't forget to bring the photos, okay? Can we get our stuff ready to leave, L?cia? Yes, that was all, guys. You can go. - Can I go too? - Oh, yes. Yes, you can! See you Monday. - Yeah... Okay. Thank you. - You're welcome. There are things we promise but can?t fulfill, right? I promised I?d not knock at your door Look at me doing so... And breaking another promise I tried not mentioning your name again But every three words I say Only one really interests me You are a problem that I want to have Even though I can?t solve it I promise I will not love you Because this is a promise I will make sure of breaking... I handed the documents in yesterday and the people there seem nice... Yeah... Yeah, today. Yeah... I just don't feel like organizing everything at once, you know? But I can do it little by little, you know? Yeah... Did you speak to him? So? Really? Alright... But can't it be done in less time? Jeez, I'll be fucked if it takes that long... No, that's alright. Okay... Okay... Well alright then! Keep me updated, okay? Send my love as well. Okay... Okay... Love ya, darling. Bye! So this area... does it belong to another regional? Yes. Not this one. This is ours, L?cia. Remember when that changed? No, no, this is in the South-Central, isn't it? No! Well, goodness... Oh, yeah! I remember now. Yes, Juliana. You're right. It did change. And where does it end? On this block, right here. S?o Jo?o Street. It ends on S?o Pedro, L?cia. No, S?o Jo?o. I'm sure. Here, look... S?o Jo?o, I'm positive. Yeah, you're right. My bad. - Got that, Juliana? - Got it. This area here is pretty chill. Soon you'll get to know the residents... then it'll be a piece of cake. You'll be having coffee with them and everything. Some nice hot coffee, yo. And cheese from the farms... That's awesome! - So where are you from, Juliana? - I'm from Ita?na. Oh, I have some relatives down there! Really? It's a big city, right? You probably don't know everyone. Yeah, you really can't. V?nio, that's my cousin. - He's in a motorcycle club there. - Cool. So here, these little harmless-looking plants, look... a little pot dish like this can hold a shitload of larvae... Be careful with the little plant. No, but listen... let me show you how to work this thing... you just turn it them... These little dishes are not ideal for holding plants. So it's better if you can put some sand in them, you know? If there's no sand to contain the water, it automatically becomes not ideal. This one has a hole on the bottom, look. Okay. When there's a hole, you don't have to mess with it. You don't want to fuck the plants up. This bucket here, look... the position he's in, see... got it? Water gets in here, so you have to turn it bottom-side up. - Got that? Here, hold this. - Okay. This tire too, right? For sure. - But water can get in here? - Yes! Let me tell you how this works. If it rains, water comes in here through there. - Boy, water gets in all over. - All over. Water... This we won't touch. Let's tell the owner to take this and put it in a place that's covered, in some place covered water won?t get in anymore. Got it? If you really look at it, it's all pretty much garbage, so they'll probably just throw it out. You have to eliminate the mosquito sources, see? The thing here is... like, this is dirty as hell, right? I'm gonna ask her... just suggest she cleans it, you know? This can be a source for Leishmaniosis, man. Damn... And another thing: if you have to touch it, never go for the bottom, 'cause there might be scorpions... Yeah dude, I even brought something to show you, look... Have you seen a... These tongs here are for catching scorpions. Has there ever been a scorpion? - For sure! - Yeah! Sure has! - So you take this... - It's pretty common. Unfortunately. Especially where there's rubble, trash... there's always scorpions. These tongs here, you think you can work them, Ju? No, I've never done it. Here's the deal: the scorpion's out don't be scared, alright? It's gonna come out, it's small, its legs are short. You pinch its tail like this, alright? Look... bam! You win. You think I'm gonna grab the scorpions' tail with that? No way, son... It's the only way... what, you gonna catch it with your hand? But I won't have the guts to grab its tail with that, I won't. Hey, it's far away, man. You get in there... bam! - Gosh dang it... - Got the scorpion... I just don't advise you to do that to snakes. - But with scorpions you can... - Yeah, not snakes... Keeping your distance is the way to go with snakes. But there you have it! Let's have a word with the owner here. It's dirty as hell. But don't be scared, man. You'll get used to this stuff along the way. Oh, no. I don't want to see scorpions. - No, but did you catch anything? - No, it's fine... So... And do you usually ask to wash your hands in the house? - Of course, Ju. - Sure. With these filthy hands here... And they'll normally let you, right? Got my container all dirty here, shit... I'm not even gonna put it back in the bag. There's a little dish left back there, look... - Over there, look! We missed it. - Oh, yeah. Hey. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Having a good day, sir? - Yes. Alright... I'm from the endemic control initiative and would like to take a look at your backyard. Oh, alright. - Mind if I take a quick look? - Sure. Come in. - Make yourself at home. - Appreciate it. Excuse me. Had a tough time today, huh Juliana?! No... it was fine. I like the job... Oh, yeah? Just don't get used to it. You realize the salary here is way low, man... This is just good for making ends meet for a while, then you bounce. - Yeah... - Can't get used to it... That's right... H?lio's been here for a while now. Me, I'm basically on the same track, you dig? Each passing day you stay, and it's fucked up, yo. But the thing is it's a tenured job, so you can't get fired. But the money sucks... And how long have you worked there? I'm six going on seven years, yo... I got about four already... - What about H?lio? - H?lio? A dinosaur. T-Rex. H?lio's got some fifteen years already... - Fifteen? - Yeah. That's a long time, right? Jesus... - Dinosaur! - T-Rex... Carlos... I just called, you didn't pick up, I called you yesterday at night, you didn't answer either... Listen, we have to discuss the furniture. There's a shelf sale, I saw it in the newspaper... I've got some ideas also... Call me when you can. Okay? Have a good day. Love you, honey. Hey, you alright over there? What do you mean? How many houses have you done today? Yeah... 22 open ones already... 22? Are you nuts? It's 20 a day. - 20? - Yeah, man. Oh, I thought it was 25... No, 25 is only when the Health Department says so. When things are going from bad to worse, you know? Oh, that's better then. So what should I do now? Go back to the school, hang around until five, then you can leave. - Until five? - 5 p.m. Can't I just leave? You can't. Or you might get in trouble... - Oh, Jesus... - That's fucked up... - Damn right... - Yeah... - Hey... are you through with yours? - Yeah, I kind of am. But I ain't going back there now, you know? I'm gonna drop by my house first. Alright... - Catch you later then. - Later. Appreciate it, Russ?o. Hey, do you want to come over? Hang around for a bit... until it's time and stuff... - Well... you think? - Yeah, come on... Do you play Playstation? Do you? Shall we? - Let's do it. - Let's do it. Is your house that way? Yeah... across the way over there. - There. - My pick? Your pick. Press down here... pick your player. - So this is me? - Yeah. I can see it already... Do you have one of these back home? No, my husband does. He's way addicted to this stuff. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. You gotta bring him to play with us. Yeah... he'll be here in a couple of days. Is he out of town? So... here's what happened... I was back there last week and they told me my admission would be made official, you know? And you didn't know? No... I took the admissions test like two years ago... I wasn't even expecting to be summoned anymore, you know? I thought it had expired or something, but then they called me... And? Oh, I came running, right? My cousin who lives here helped me find a shed and stuff... And Carlos, my husband, he couldn't just come 'cause he, like, hadn't planned anything, you know? But he's gonna quit his job, he kinda already wanted to. So he'll just serve the notice period, and soon he'll come and we'll live together. What a beautiful love story you have. But your playing is garbage. No, but... no, I play better, I was telling you the story and I got distracted... So hey, are you tired already? Wanna play one more? Russ?o, sorry to ask, but could I have a glass of water? Water? You want it natural, chilled? - Chilled is fine. - You got it. Jeez, I apologize. I forgot to offer you. No, that's fine. My mother gives me a hard time if I go two days without calling her. Two days and she starts bothering me. Lovely... She thinks I should call her every day. She wishes... Can you imagine? Sometimes I'm so busy running around I can't remember. - Dear God... - She gives me a hard time... You should be thankful, you know? My mother, if she saw this mess... she would destroy me. She was kind of a neat freak... Yeah, cous... it ain't easy losing your mother, you know? I know, Juliana. I haven't lost my mother. But I also never had a father, right? Although losing your mother is probably worse. Sometimes I stop and think: Goddammit, that was so stupid! If only she were more careful, she'd be here... but what do I know, right? Yeah, what do we know? Yeah, I know. You know what I mean. I just keep thinking about this fate thing, if her time arrived... I don't know... It's just that some things I think are carved in stone But what if it wasn't her time and because she didn't realize something she's not around anymore... you know? I know. But there are also the things that we do ourselves. That we control. I don't know... I don't know. How do you feel about that? Do you agree? - I think so too. - Yeah... It's just like my neighbor Vani, right? Her doctor said she couldn't drink anymore. And she kept at it. She and her husband owned a bar... and she drank herself to death, you know? See? - So sad. - Yeah... But hey, thank you so much. For finding this place for us. - I really appreciate it! - Please... - Did you know the owner? - My brother-in-law knows her. Oh, I see. Alright... - But... do you like it? - Yeah... no, I do. There's some infiltrations to take care of, the toilet flush... Have you talked to her? Yeah... I have, it's all good. There's also Carlos, he's very nitpicky. Jesus... And we lived in a much better house there, so... But this is fine for now. I'm very happy here, everything's just fine, no worries... Alright. But cous, how are things with him? Gosh... It's complicated, you know? We're fine, but we're not. You know how it goes, right? Oh yeah, I know how it goes. Yeah... it has been eight years, right, cous? - I thought it was less. - No, eight years... - three years dating. - Oh Okay, three dating... Cous, if I tell you something, you won't tell anyone, right? Of course. - Do you want a little something? - Mmm-hmm. But what is it? You can say... A while ago I got pregnant. Yeah... it's... it's been almost two years now. But it feels like yesterday. Carlos was so overjoyed. Got all excited. I was unemployed then, you know? But I got excited too. He was already at this job he's at now, but he was happy. Making very little money, trouble with the rent, bills to pay and all... But he went cuckoo, like a child. Me too. I was scared, you know? Of course. But... did you get an abortion? No, wait... So, I was... six months pregnant, big belly and all... I don't know why, but I didn't really talk to anyone about the pregnancy. Then we went to the doctor and he told us it was a girl. Carlos was over the moon, got so ecstatic! He told his mother, who lives in Vit?ria da Conquista, he had a surprise but would only tell her in person. We were so happy... so happy. Then one day he was leaving work, by car, he stopped by downtown to pick me up. Cruising, man, just cruising... going slow on the main avenue. Really slow, just cruising. For real. Then the car in front of us suddenly hit the brake, because of a pedestrian. So Carlos hit the brakes too, but he crashed into the rear of the other car. And I was holding a box. I flew towards the front and hit my belly. Just hit it... Oh, I felt so much pain! Gosh, it hurt so much. I never felt so much pain in my life, really. So we flew to the hospital. I kept throwing up... felt really sick. Never threw up like that in my life. So when I got to the hospital the doctor said I should get an exam... Then, I'm not sure how, I fell asleep, don't even remember... And then... The other day I woke up and the doctor said we'd lost the baby. God... I don't know what to say. Carlos went crazy... desperate, really. I did too, but he took it harder. Yeah, he took it the hardest... and so, since then, our relationship sort of broke, you know? Turned to shit, that's what. Maria Luiza! You don't go walking inside people's homes like that! Bad girl! Juliana... I'm coming in, okay? Listen, you know that toilet flush problem you complained about? What? The handyman is coming to check that running flush for you. No, I have to leave for work soon. Well, hun, did you not complain? I'm sorry, but he'll be right here. After that I don't know when he can come back. Then I won't be able to do anything about it, you hear, Juliana?! - Right, alright. - Alright then. I'm gonna go wait for him, okay? Thank you. Thank you. Look, there's nothing here. I think the problem might be on the roof. It's been a while since I've been up there, it's probably filled with junk. But do we have to go up this ladder? Yeah. There's no way up from inside the house? No, it's blocked. Well, it's gonna be hard then... Are you afraid? Yeah, I am. I'll help you out, look! I can hold this steady, it's safe. No, no... So what then? How can you work this Dengue thing and not climb ladders? Maybe I can come back later... Will you be here all day? I will, but... you're gonna have to go up, right? I can climb up there and have a look, like... but you're gonna have to go up anyway, right? No, alright... alright! I'll hold this. Go ahead. Oh dear lord... Go ahead, man. It's safe. Nice view, huh? From here, right? Very nice. Have you lived here long? About thirty years. Long time, huh? Yeah... a long time. But it didn't use to be like this, the neighborhood. There were half of these houses here. - The city grows so fast, right? - Yeah... especially the last ten years. None of this businesses up the avenue existed. We had to go buy bread all the motherfucking way over there! All the way up there... Look, that's my brother-in-law Hey, Vandinho! - Is that your brother-in-law? - Yeah... didn't see me. Part of the people here came from the Lunch-Bucket Workers Village, where the expressway is now, you know? Yeah, no... I don't know, really. Don't know where that is. My father says those folks were thrown out of there. City Hall came and threw them all out on the street, and so they came on foot, by wagon... Jeez... Fucked up, right? - It's so many people! - Damn right it is! Now I have to see how I'm gonna climb down from here, right? You're fine, man. You afraid to go down? No, no... I'm fine. The way down is easier, right? Honey, I'd like to go to dinner some place expensive today. Okay. You come home, make some coffee, sit in front of the TV and there's no one to talk to... If that's loneliness or freedom it's up to you. Goddammit! Go knock on someone else's door at this hour, motherfucker! - I apologize, ma'am. - What is it? I'm sorry, I'm sorry... I work for the Dengue combat force. I need to take a look at your house. Shit! At this hour? I was sleeping. You boys... couldn't even tell the lady. You little fuckers! Why didn't you tell her I work at night? Nevermind then... Okay. I'm sorry. I'll come back later. Okay? Listen, lady, you should come back some other time, you know why? I was sleeping here! But there are no little plants, little pots with water, none of that. There's no Dengue mosquito or anything here, alright? But hey, I apologize. I'm gonna go ahead and close this and you'll come back some other time, alright? Good day. Good day. Don't mind her, lady. That woman is really stressed out. Yeah... Look, lady, what should I do to get work like yours? - You have to take a test. - Does it pay well? - It doesn't. - So why do you do it? Because I have to pay my bills. Listen, lady, what's the name of that friend of yours who passed by here, with the green pants? Green pants? That's Jaque. Why? Tell her my friend here thinks she's hot. Quit it, man! Grow up, you're such a clown. Alright. I'll talk to her. Hey, miss, do you see that white gate over there? - Yeah. - Don't go there, alright? They'll come out shooting if it's the Dengue crew. Stop it, man. You messing with Paulo's girl? Man. Those people are creepy. Didn't you see the other day? - Hey, Ju... - Yeah. What are you doing the Saturday after this? Nothing, I guess. Why? Come by my house, man. Around seven... I'm celebrating my birthday. Oh, cool. Alright. I'll try to stop by. Give me the address later. I'll do it at the end of the shift, Okay? - Cool. Cool... - When I'm leaving. - Alright. Thanks, H?lio. - You got it. Later. Thank you. Have a nice day. You too. H?lio... Come here! Come here, Jaque! Come fast, you guys! People! Everyone's here, right? Look, we're wrapping this up now, okay? Right now! What is it, L?cia, is something going on? A police car just flew by me I think there's something going down here. Take it easy, L?cia, this is how it is. Could be some incident. That's right, yo, chill. These people know we work here, they know us, see? Guys! "Take it easy", "chill", how? You think I'm gonna leave my crew here? Are you out of your mind? In the middle of a shootout? No way! I'll shut up now. Not another word... You better, H?lio! You better. Is Luciano coming to pick us up? I'm waiting for his answer. I've already texted him. What do the cops have to do with our work, brother? If we start worrying about the cops, man, going up and down that community every day. And everybody knows us there, dude. - They know us, H?lio... - Come on... Any place we go there, man. They respect us. We're like a concept to the community, man. Hey, man... gotta keep an eye on that woman, man. Hey, man, I'm pretty sure that she's trying to bump us to another regional, H?lio. She can bump this to another regional, right? - Right, my man? - For real. - Have you felt that too? - Hey, a whole lot. I'm sure, man, she's trying to send us to another regional. But you know what, I'm starting to figure her out. You know what's bothering her, my man? It's our glow, brother. We come, man, we steal the show. Just feel the energy. Can you feel it? You feel it? The glow, man, it's intense. It's an intense glow. Come on, man. After this, I'm leaving. Seriously? No, man. Don't. - Be cool, brother. - After this, I'm out. You really out, man? Don't be silly, man. Think straight, H?lio. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Look. Pull your pants out of your ass, H?lio! But, Ju, I'm laughing here, but I'm hella worried. Worried, why? I think I'm gonna, like, be a dad. - A dad? - I'm not sure, you know? - You're not? - No. This girl I was with a while back, she asked for a D.N.A. test, you know? So I'm freaking out. - My goodness! - Just picture the situation. I'm a broke dude, you know that. Never had a thing in my life, man. - Oh... - Working my ass off, always on this daily struggle and stuff, and suddenly I find out I'm a dad? - Damn... - You understand? It's gonna be hard, man. And it was a fling, you know? It was? I was with this girl a while back and all. It was, like, unexpected. We did it. We were hanging out and stuff. And so now she comes back, right? All this time's passed and she asks for a test. - So now I have to take it, right? - Yeah, you have to take it. You gotta know, right? Are you a mom? Do you have children? - No. - No? Yeah, I hear ya. And now I gotta... Gotta do it, right? So what do you think? I'm living in this reality now that, just have to face it, right? Head on. Yeah, gotta face it. Do it. But it'll be fine, man. Take it easy. It'll be fine. I'm hella worried, man. But I think I'll live. It's worse in the war, right? And I heard the kid's, like, three already. - Three years old? - It's a boy. Yeah. - A boy? - Yeah! - Talking already... - Talking, pooping, walking, almost going out by himself. It'll be a pretty big responsibility. But... can you imagine? - Right... - Little Russ?o. Little Russ?o... Carlos, what's going on? For God's sake! No... I tried to reach someone in Vit?ria da Conquista today, your mom didn't pick up, your sister didn't pick up, I can't get a hold of them... I left Pablo a message, but he didn't read it. What is going on, man? Tell me, call me, text me, something. Give me a sign. I'm worried... I'm worried. Okay? Hi, Suzana. It's me. What's up? Dear Lord... Okay. No, no, no I'll figure something out. Okay. Alright. Alright. Appreciate it. Okay. Bye. Juliana is here and she wants to talk to you. - Hey, Juliana. - Hi, Mauricio. - Everything okay? - Oh, not really, right? I don't know what's going on, Carlos is missing. Yeah, Suzana said you called earlier. I was caught up. I'm sorry I couldn't return the call. He packed up his stuff and left, didn't even quit. People say he went out of town. I found it strange when Suzana said you didn't know anything. My goodness! What happened? That's what I want to know, right? Such lack of responsibility from Carlos. He's just gone, left a bunch of unfinished work behind. I don't even know what to tell you. Honestly. If he doesn't come back, we're gonna have to get someone to replace him. No way around it... Juliana? Hi, dad. Everything alright with you? I'm just here doing my things. What are you doing here? I'm just dropping by real quick. Came to get some stuff... Well... Alright. - Bye. - Bye. Hey... H?lio? Jeez, my bad. No, I'll be right there. I am. I'll be right there. Okay. Bye. Shit... So, Juliana, you think that's worth two days off? VACCINATION CAMPAIGN AGAINST RABIES It sucks working on Saturdays, right? - If only there was money in it... - You?re right about that. I'll be right there! Cous! I'm sorry. I was sorting some stuff out back at the house - and I lost track of time. - Okay. - Come here... - Okay. Sorry I can't invite you in, but my mother-in-law's here. - She'll start asking questions... - Okay, it's fine. Okay? Here. Cous... This is it. Oh boy. You don't have to worry, I won't... - It won't be long. Okay? - Okay. I'll need it. - You really can't take too long. - No, no. I've got this. But take your time, whenever you can. - Alright? - Alright. So... Okay, then. I still have a lot to do back home. Me too... I gotta run, got a bunch of stuff to do as well. Hey L?cia, does this pump go? No, not that one. - Should we take the filing cabinet? - Yes, that goes. What about this gallon? That one's not... no, that goes. - It goes? - Yes. Watch out for the contents, you hear? H?lio, can you grab those boxes for me, please? Jaque, afterwards you can help H?lio with the cabinet, okay? It's on the heavier side. - Okay. Are we taking this as well? - Those I'll... Just a minute, okay? Are you taking down the posters, Juliana? - Careful not to tear them. - Okay. AMAZONAS NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS' ASSOCIATION You be careful, Juliana! Marcelina, put those boxes against the wall, they're fragile. Oh, you coming this way? Let me get that. Could I put on some music? - Just so we can groove a little. - Well... Okay. But keep the volume down. Listen, Jaqueline... connect this phone afterwards, I'm gonna put it on my desk, okay? I'll put it over there then. Juliana, there's some stuff in the bathroom... Okay, I'll be there in a minute. "I'm gonna be a dad". "I'll talk to you later, alright?" - So you're from Ita?na? - Yeah. - Awesome. - So you know the city well then? I know enough. - Yeah? - Yeah. What do you know there? - Oh, is that a challenge? - Challenge! I wanna know... Let's see... Sandoval. Sandoval... You really know Ita?na. Oh, the food at Sandoval, goddammit, it's good... Get there at 3 a.m., you can get a full meal. Wonderful. - What else? - Well... Ritz. Ritz? You really know your way around. - Have you ever been to Ritz? - Oh, no. I didn't... My cousin used to go there all the time. - Yeah? - All the time. I don't know, I was a little scared... - Didn't really go there, you know? - Yeah, I gotcha. Ritz was always a heat-packing spot. "Heat-packing", that's good... "Heat-packing"... So, take a look. - Hmm. - Dope, right? Dope... Here's the deal: I'm gonna be a dad now, right? So the idea is to open a salon, see? I'm thinking about opening a salon right here. Oh, a salon? Wow... It's actually gonna be a barbershop that's really trending right now. - Right, a barbershop... - It'll be a top barbershop. We're gonna take over this area, you know? That's awesome. This money we make here at Endemics' Control is pocket change, right? - It's not enough for two people. - Damn right. - So... that's the idea now. - Nice. But have you ever cut hair before? That's the thing, man. I've never actually cut hair. In fact, I once cut my cousin's hair. But I shaved it. But... That's the thing, man. You catch on to it real quick and all... It's practice, right? And I'm thinking I'll open it work nights and weekends. - Oh... weekends? - Weekends. Oh, you'll be so tired, Russ?o. Weekends? Damn... Let me tell you something, Ju: I gotta bring home the bacon! Am I right? I'm a penniless father. Gotta work my butt off. You got that right. But where are you gonna learn to cut hair, man? Dude, there's a friend of mine who knows about a school, and he's gonna get me a discount, see? At a class they have downtown. That's why I called you here. How would you like to come down there with me today? In fact, right now. So we can just go, get the hang of it and get started on this new business? - Well... - Come on! You game? - I am... - Power, baby! - Alright. - Let's do this. What's up, Ju! How you doing? - Me? - Yeah. I'm just fine. Why? You don't really share much. Yeah, I'm... That's me. Is your husband here? - I don't know about my husband. - What do you mean? - Does this bus take long, Russ?o? - Usually no. - It's about to arrive. - It's coming? Thank God! - What up, Leozim? - Hey, Russ?o! - How are you, little buddy? - Doing good, brother? - This is my friend Juliana. - Hey, Juliana. How are you? Am I too early? We said we'd go there... No, brother. I was just waiting for you. - Oh, yeah? So can we go? - Yeah. Let's go then. - Mimi, can I go now? - Alright. Thank you. Crazy stuff, right? You like those? Damn, Leozin. That boss of yours seems real nice, bro. She's cool, but she's always pretty silent like that, 'cause she doesn't really understand Portuguese. - Oh, yeah? - It's kinda hard to talk to her. She's got a real hot niece, I'm kind of in love, you know? - Oh, yeah? - For real. - Platonic love? - Very platonic. But that's 'cause she's way too hot. For real. She's so fucking hot. - Awesome. - For real. That's nice. - What's up, Denilson? My brother! - Hey, Leozim, brother. Doing good? I haven't seen you much. - What's up? - Doing fine... This is Russ?o, that brother I told you about, remember? Hey, what's up? This is Juliana... Yeah, you said something. 'Sup, Russ?o? He's about to open a barbershop, you know? And I wanted to see if you could, like, get him a nice discount. - Cool. You said that. - If you could help him out. - He needs to learn ASAP, you know? - Yeah, I got you. Let's see. Russ?o, have you had any experience using an electric shaver, a razor, that sort of stuff? You know, man... not really. But... like, dude... Actually I once cut my cousin's hair, with a shaver and all, and I've been watching some videos on Youtube, some tutorials and stuff. I think I'll catch on fast, you know? Yeah, I got you. You'll see that... here at the school things are a little different. But come on, let me show you around. You got a minute? - For sure, man... - Cool. Wanna go? Alright, brother. I'm gonna take off then... - You leaving, my man? - I gotta run. - Well, come back later, man. - Alright. - So we can talk some more. - Alright. Alright, Leozim. Really appreciate it, man. - You got it, Russ?o. See ya. - Bye, Leozim. - Bye. - Thank you. So, Ju. Can you hang on a little bit? First class is probably not too long, right? I think. Yeah, that's okay. Afterwards we can chill, we'll go to Cheap Eats and grab some lunch... - Alright. That's cool. - Then we'll head home. - Is that cool? - Yeah. Alright. - So where is it, brother? - This room right here. Come on. Thank you, man. Damn, so cool. What's up? What about that hair? Wanna cut it? No, no. I'm just waiting for Russ?o. You're not doing anything, man. Russ?o's gonna be a while. Since you're here, you could get your hair cut. No, no. Not today, no. Listen, let me tell you. Cuts here, done by students, are much cheaper. Besides, I've got a hairdresser here. A girl who really knows how to work ladies' hairs, maybe she could give you some tips, come up with something different for you and all. Oh, no, I think I'm alright. Look, the cut's really affordable here. I usually charge 20 bucks, but for you, since it's your first time here, you're with Russ?o, - I'll charge you 15. - No, it's not that. Come on, man. - Hi. - Hey. Could you weight a chicken breast for me? Of course. That smaller one's fine. - That'll be 4,72. - Okay. - How are you doing, H?lio? - What's up? What are you doing here all by yourself? How about that new hair? What about it? New hair... I'm just enjoying the view. The view? Why don't you go to Lake Pampulha? You're in the middle of the sewer... - I've caught fish here, man. - Fish? I'm telling you. You mean those trash-eating little catfish, right? To each his own, Ju. You think I'm gonna go all the way to that motherfucking Pampulha, that bean-smelling lagoon? That's sewer too, man. Well, sit down. Pull up a chair and sit on the floor. But what is it? What's going on? Oh, nothing. Same old shit. This job fucking sucks, man. My sisters are all up in my face about finding a new job, my mom's ill. - Shit's hard... ... - Jeez. That's too bad, man. Shit... Yeah, but it's all good. - That's the way it is. - Yeah, don't even get me started. But hey, how did you like the party? It was good. I drank so much! It was fun, right? - I forgot to tell you... - What? - Jairo liked you. - Oh yeah? Yeah. It took him a while to say it, but... What about you? Did you like him? I did, I did. That dude's fucking great, man. Yeah, he's cool... Nice guy. He plays handball... But I don't know, my head's not really in that right now, H?lio... I'm going through some things that I'm still processing, you know? It's like they say: If I told you what I'm going through, you'd bend over and let me fuck you right now. I know how it is. Tough. Oh, but... I don't know. I'm also going through things I would never have imagined. Meeting you guys, all of you, doing my own things. That's really fucking good, you know? But there's also some fucked up shit... It's hard. It's just, I've never really had friends, H?lio. You know? Yeah. So... Tough, man. But, I don't know. I guess some things had to change. Or not. I don't know. Who knows. I don't really know what I'm talking about. Speaking of change... - it reeks, here. - Yeah. - Wanna bounce? - Yeah, come on. - Want a hand with that? - No, no. I got it. AMAZONAS NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS' ASSOCIATION - Crazy weather, right? - Who can figure it out, huh? Jesus, look at this. Hey, Juliana. I don't know if the guys told you, but we don't go out on the street when it's pouring like this. There's no way, right? We do stuff inside, or else we just wait. Look, Jaque. - Who's that? - Little Cassiano. - My goodness, he's huge. - Yeah. Sixteen already, girl. - Your son? - My son. - Time flies, right? - Jeez, so much! I didn't even see it, really. - Which one is he? - The one in the yellow shirt. Oh... It's 'cause his father's white, you see? Got it. - Are you back together, L?cia? - No, are you crazy? No, this last time was for real. I couldn't take it anymore. - Twenty years, Juliana... - Twenty! - Twenty years. - That's a lot. Yeah, it's no joke. I was so young when I started dating him. So in love, he kept saying he loved me, he loved me... How it always is in the beginning, right? Everything's beautiful, right? But he had some friends, very weird dudes, you know? Jerks... and they had an influence on him. His family did, too. There were no black people in his family. They treated me well and everything, but I don't know, something felt strange. Every once in a while something weird happened - that made me wonder, you know? - Yeah, gotcha. And there was this thing... we were at a party... I've never forgotten. You know those things that hurt you deep down? I went to a party with him, a wedding, and these friends I was talking about were there. I was right by his side and they kept telling him: "Man, you can get any girl you want... and you choose her?". - To my face, to my face! - That's awful. I was so hurt. But you know what I did? Kept my mouth shut. Not a word. - And him? - He realized, you know? He felt the punch. So he distanced himself from these friends, from his family. That's when we got married. And you know who came soon after? Little Cassiano. Oh, girls... But after a while it started going sour, we started fighting, until it just ended. - That old story. - Yeah, marriage, right? So now I'm hanging on, right? Hanging out with my boo. So delicious, girls. - Six feet hot. - Six feet? Do you have a pic? Yeah, wanna see? Let me find it. Hold on... here. Look at this shirtless one. You're too tall. I even had to climb this little ramp. - Sorry. - No, it's alright. Ma'am. Excuse me? Coming in. I need to fill your form. Yes, darling, of course. Make yourself at home. Have a seat on the couch, I'm making us some coffee. There's no need for coffee, please. I'm fine. Yes, there is. You're gonna have some of my coffee. I'll be right there. - Oh, you didn't have to. - Please, darling. Of course I did. You're gonna like my coffee. You'll see. Thank you. - How do you take your coffee? - Sugar. Oh, thank God. I put some sugar in already. - What a beautiful cup. - It is, isn't it? I think so too. So... now, while you drink your coffee, I'm gonna go get the cake. - No, there's no need for cake. - Yes, there is. - There's no need. - Yes, there is. - Can't you smell it? - Yes. It's sweet cornmeal and cheese. - Sweet cornmeal and cheese? - Can you imagine... You're not leaving here without eating. I know how it is. You're up early, walking around under this sun without having proper food. And you know, "an empty belly hears nobody". So, you can just relax and I'll bring you some cake. - Alright. Thank you so much. - Okay? I'm gonna go get it. No need to thank me. Listen, darling, I wanted to ask you. It's been a while since you came here about the Dengue stuff. In fact, my front neighbor... I asked her: "Listen, Teresinha, haven't the Dengue kids been around?". She said: "It's funny, they haven't been at my place as well". So we were worried. 'Cause I practically haven't been out. I fell down and hurt my leg. I've been home alone, 'cause the boys are all working. Thank goodness they have jobs. But I stay here all alone, so... I don't really know what's going on. My youngest is very close with that Dengue fellow H?lio, I don't know if you know him... Guys. I just came from the bank and our paycheck was just credited. - Sweet! - Praise the Lord Almighty. Wow... Oh boy, I can hardly believe it. Jaque, - What about H?lio? - What about him? There's something going on between you two, right? Jeez, Ju. Can you tell? Well, I watched you guys at the party, it felt like there was something. - I don't know, I'm not sure. - Did you seriously see something? Actually, it wasn't me who realized. Someone told me, you know? - You're joking... - They did, man. Who told you? - I'm kidding. - Jeez, Juliana. I'm kidding. Listen, rest assured I won't tell anyone. - Please don't, Juliana. - Okay? Alright. Are you going across the street? Yeah. I'm gonna check something out. Give me a hug then. Jaque and H?lio sitting in a tree! Stop it, Juliana! Stop! Jesus. What are you, eight? Memories of our vacation in Pedro Leopoldo. Love you. 07/19/1983 Don't worry, there are no dogs here, okay? You can see everything's very clean, look. There's no Dengue here. - What about this pool? - It's not being used. Yes, but is it empty? If there is water in there, it's rain water. - Mind if I check? - Sure. Be my guest. Just to be safe... Goddamn! Mister! Throw that tarp back on! Shit! It's Dengue combat day in Contagem, located in the suburbs of Belo Horizonte, state of Minas Gerais. The Health Department promoted a local campaign to inform the population about the risks of the disease. Residents exchanged probable sources of mosquito reproduction for school supplies. Turns out sometimes we do have possible sources at home. And since it has spread this year, everybody's afraid, right? So I decided to get rid of these things that were just lying there. Kids have already learned that this small gesture can avoid bigger problems to a lot of people. It's helping people to not get Dengue and die, right? We have to help... we have to save people. During the action, the Health Department presented a new weapon against the disease. A large delivery of... There was a time I really wanted to do ambulance work, you know? But are you a certified nurse? No. It was just something I wanted, but I didn't study for it or anything. To do that kind of work you at least need some training as a nurse, right? Yeah. I'm not sure it's a license you need. Is it licensed or certified? - I don't even know anymore... - Oh, I don't know, guys. I wanted to work in an ambulance. Who knows if it's licensed, certified... I don't know shit about that. But the fire brigade is awesome. Man! Yeah. Really cool. And you can make some extra money. Yeah, I'll probably have a little dough saved by the end of this year. - Maybe get a car, huh? - I'm thinking about that. - Really? - Yeah... Juliana... Mmm... I hope you're doing okay. First of all, I'm sorry, but I don't think you'll forgive me... Ever, actually. I know that. I know I'm being a jerk... It's complicated. But... I'm doing it because I... Man, I get really pissed when I try to solve things and I can't. But what happened with the bank thing? Well, I had a problem with my card, so I went there to try and talk with the manager. There was a huge line and when my turn came, the guy just took off. Left me hanging and I couldn't settle it. Banks are so fucked up. You know I opened an account here, right? But there's no manager. Man... I'm mad as hell. For God's sake. If there's a bank, there should be a manager. And the thing is I'm really short on money, you know? I only have a couple of bucks on me, I can barely pay for my ticket. Oh, Russ?o... I'm telling you, if I had it, I'd help you out, - but I don't. - Look who's here! Again. Come on, Enzo. Come on, come on... Look at this! Now let's do the finger. What's that finger thing again? Bye, Russ?o. Bye, Juliana. - You okay there? - Yeah. - Now dive! - No way. Come on! - Were you a bully at school? - No. - You look like you were a bully. - I wasn't. The boys were. Talking was my thing. Chatting galore. I liked having lots of friends at school. Oh, I wasn't like that. - You weren't? - No. I was quiet, you know? Real quiet. Did you know when I was seven I just... stopped talking? - Really? - Yeah. I went like three years without speaking. Jeez, that's a long time. I have no idea what happened. Boy, my parents were so worried. I can imagine. - You didn't say a word? - Not a word, nothing. They even got a Psychologist from the Public Health Center to see me. Mmm-hmm. But he was no help. My goodness... And the teachers at school went beserk as well. But time started passing and they all just got used to it... The kids that were my friends started talking to me using gestures... I took oral exams in writing. Everyone got used to it. My mom, my dad... Nobody expected me to speak again, you know? Not even me. - And you know how it happened? - Hmm. I had a neighbor I was really fond of. She was so nice. She was like 80, lived alone. When she heard I stopped talking, she started coming over every day to read me stories. - You know? - Mmm She said: "try to babble some of the story", just to try and get me to talk, you know? And you didn't, right? She was sure there was nothing wrong with me, that I just needed to get started. So one day I was home alone, sleeping, and I started to smell something burning, you know? I pulled up a little stepladder, looked over the wall, and saw a ton of smoke coming out of her kitchen. Jeez... And the burning smell was really strong. I thought the whole house was gonna burn down. So I started screaming. I screamed, and I screamed, and I screamed. - And so I spoke, you know? - You started... Then she showed up. She wasn't home... She must have been happy, right? That you started talking again. Yeah... she was sad, she'd left a pan on the stove, something like that. But then she looked at me and said: "Look, she?s speaking!?. - Thank God! - Crazy stuff, right? Yeah, intense. Intense. Jeez. This is hard. Yeah. We're screwed, right? I don't think it's gonna work. So what now? - Yeah, man. We're fucked. - It's not gonna happen. Yeah, it's dead. Goddammit! - So? - So we're fucked, man. - Fucked? - Fucked. Guys. The car won't start. So what now? Now we push it. Oh no, not pushing. I so don't feel like pushing a car right now. For the love of G od... Listen, Edu, will you let me drive? Go for it. - Can you drive? - Well... It's not like I have a license, but... - come on, guys! - Come on. What else... - Can we go? - Hold on. - You ready, Ju? - Go ahead. Come on... Push, push, push... Come on, come on, come on, H?lio...
