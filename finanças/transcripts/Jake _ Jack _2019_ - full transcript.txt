What'd I say, when someone's here with me I'm what? - Working. - And this gentleman is a what? A client.. - Go to your room now. - Come on bro. - So what's going on? - My life didn't exactly turn out the way I wanted it to. And I certainly didn't plan to have them be a part of any of this. Growing up I watched my mother hustle, abuse her body just to feed me and my sisters. My mother died and I started hustling just to get by. I never really had what you would call a real job. Jake he's, he's my sister's kid. She took him to a park when he was one and abandoned him and she just left. I already had Jack, he was being passed up at the foster home. He called me mom the very first day. They're my boys. - So about that hour. - Hello. - Jake man, where you at? - I'm at Tiff's, why? - Jack, get off the damn phone. I'm not finished talking to you. - Dog you need home momma trippin' again. - All right, whatever, I'm on my way. Fuck. - Look Ma, I'll go back to work when I'm damn ready. They got no staff they ain't about to fire me, they need me. - It doesn't matter, like you said the staff is low, do you think they want some lazy bastard working for them. They will fire you. - Jack missed work again. - Yes Jake, your brother missed work again all because you two can't come home at a responsible hour. This is the third time this week y'all come home at three o'clock in the morning. I call the neighbors, they ain't seen you. What the heck y'all be doing? My biggest fear is something's gonna happen to you and then what? Where we gonna be at then? - Biggest fear, biggest fear, that's bullshit. Look, I got Jake and Jake got me that's it. - Right Momma, please just chill. - Before you have a damn heart attack. - Oh I need to chill, I need to chill. Fine, go to work. Grounded. Go, tried of looking at y'all, go. - Yes, mam. - Oh, is something funny? - No mam. - Something funny? Get out of my face, go, get out of my face. - Yes mam. - Tired of dealing with y'all. - So how'd it go with Tiffany today bro? - Man you know how it went, we just a put on a good movie, talked about shit that interest us, and then she just fall asleep on my chest bro. I mean I think I might honestly break up with her to be honest. - What? Why? - 'Cause I mean look Tiffany bro, she a good girl and all but look I don't wanna be stringing her along like that. I mean just the love ain't really there no more. - Man you gonna regret that, I can see the writing on the wall already. - Yeah, you can see the writing on the wall, okay, look man you need to be handling your girl, all right. I'm sick of her always blowing up my phone asking me about you. - Man, I got that. Where that box of rubbers at though? - Oh, that's gone bro. - What? - Yeah, I sold them to TJ for 20 bucks. - Hey, you know you giving me half that money right. - That's gone too. - I gotta go to work dog. - Hey bro that's really gay. - What? - That you getting undressed in front of me. Look your my brother I love you and all but I mean I don't swing that way bro. - Shut the hell up Jake. Have you seen my work shirt dog? Let me turn on the radio Mom. - Don't touch my radio. - So how long am I grounded for? - Until I say otherwise. - So not an answer. - You know it's not like it matters what I say 'cause you're gonna do whatever the heck you wanna do anyway. So Jake, you planning on getting a job anytime soon? I'm sure Tiffany would appreciate a man who works and makes a honest living. - I don't need no job, I can just keep selling Jack's earrings to pawn shops. - What? - Yeah. - What you say? - Have you at least checked on your application with Taco Bell? - Momma that was two months ago if they ain't call me back by now I probably didn't get the job. - Told your ass say you was part Mexican, you woulda had the job then. All right y'all. All right Jake, Momma's is your problem now. - You be good too boy. Don't get wrote up no more. - Shit what's up Phil? I didn't see you standing there man, you shave lifting weights, looking pretty good man. - So what's up? - Shit gas price pretty high on the way here bro. - I mean why are you late again. And you missed three days of work this week and last week. - Look man, you can stop bitching at me about it, all right, I'm here now. - Oh so now I'm bitching, I'm bitching. Do you want a job here or not? Nobody else will take you right now. This is it. Show up late again for work and you're fired. Now get your stuff, get dressed, and get to work. - Beth, Beth wait. - It's over. - Why, I thought everything was good? - Well it's not okay. Look Jack I think we should just end it here. - Give me one good reason why. - Because Jack you don't even have time for a girlfriend right now, do you? You're always out partying with your friends. You like spending time with them so much let them be your girlfriend. - Look I gotta cut back on all that anyway, my manager getting down my back. - More excuses. Look Jack, I don't care what you do but I want a man not some child I have to take care of. Call me when you grow up. - You good. - I'm good. People come and go man.

But you know what for you I'm gonna step it up a notch. How about we go to Coney Island? I mean how you like that?

It say 30 days. - Okay, now you know Jack, why are you yelling in my face? What you gonna do about it? - Man I woulda worked overtime, something. - I woulda got a job. - I tried and tried to get you two to start pulling your weight around here, all you wanna do is go out there and run around in the street.

My mom wasn't the adult she shoulda been and we laid up at Tiffany's till we get back on our feet. And I feel like it's on me to fix it so that's what I'm gonna do. - Fix it, how? Jack you carry the weight of the world on your shoulders and this isn't your mistake to fix, it's your mom's, she messed up not you or Jake. - She don't even got a plan for herself right now. You know she park that car next to a curb every night, sleeping in it, switching streets every day, ain't no life for her, Jake, for you. - For me? - Yeah, for you. I wish I woulda just listened and not fuck around all the time. Went to work, been a better man for you. - You give me the same rehearsed speech every time and nothing ever changes, nothing. I love you Jack with all my heart but it's a pattern with you and I always take you back. I can't do that this time, at least not right away like I usually do. - Look, I know you won't take me back right now, I know this but I at least want you to hear what stupid thing I've done 'cause I tell you when I fuck up. And I feel like I might not come back from this one. - Pause, what do you mean by that? You're scaring me baby. - Introducing the newest neighborhood dope boy. Look, I just want you to know that if something happens to me I did it to try to fix what went wrong, rebuild what I lost,. - I love you Jack. - I love you too, Beth. - You're gonna make it. You're not gonna die, you're gonna come home understand me. I'm not going nowhere. - Neither am I baby. - My mom's gonna get up for work soon, you gotta go. - Evelyn, I reviewed your resume and I think your work experience is just outstanding so what I'd like you to do now is just tell me a little bit about yourself as a person. - Okay, well, I'm a quick learner. I'm fast on my feet. I have great listening skills. I really know how to make suggestions to get people to spend more money. I've always been a very neat person, I cannot stand a water ring on a table so believe me when I tell you that I will have those tables spotless. I'm really good at counting money if that ever proves to be useful for you in the future. And I'm just a all around people person and I can do pretty much anything you need me to do and I will do it to the best of my ability that I can guarantee. - Okay, Evelyn. Well thanks for coming over today and we'll be giving you a call. - I know what that means. - It means nothing. It just simply means if you get a call, you have the job. - Okay look, listen, I'm not telling you this because I'm looking for your sympathy, I'm telling you this because I need you to know how serious I am. Me and my family recently just got evicted from our home and my boys they damn near got arrested in the process. I have 19-year-old son out there on the streets doing God knows what, trying to get himself killed. And I have very impressionable 16-year-old who knows where he is. And while I hope that they are safe they sleep under a warm roof with their friends every night while I'm sleeping in my car going from job to job just trying to rebuild. I'm not looking for your pity and I don't want it, any of it, I need to you know, I just need a chance. I just need this job. - You know you are the serious person that I've been looking for.

That's Evelyn we talking about. - Yeah, I know and she is the person that she is but you told me she said, "She's trying to start over." - Yeah, but it's a little late for all that now, don't ya think? - No. - It's easy for you to say that. Like she put us through so much shit, like the whole reason we here right now is her. Like it's just a constant battle. You ain't have to grow up like that. - I'll give you that and you never should've had to put up with that but don't just say fuck it until you've at least given her another chance. - I guess. - I got something else I wanna say. - I'm all ears baby. - I don't know how to roll with this relationship the way you are now.
