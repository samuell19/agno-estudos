Hey man. So, you're the guy? Oh, yeah. You're alone, right? Yeah, yeah, is it cool if I start filming now? No, when we get inside. You're not gonna try to fuck me, are you? No, no way, man, not at all, no. All right, all right good. You know, 'cause people like to spin shit and I don't want you spinning my shit all around making me look stupid or bad or anything. No, no way, man, no, I wouldn't, I wouldn't. All right, 'cause I wanna look at all the footage before you do anything with it, I want, what do you fucking call that in movies? I want final cut. Of course, man, all yours. All right, okay. I cannot stress enough how important it is that you do not try to fuck me. Well, I guess, set up wherever you want, how do you wanna do this? So, what do I? Do I talk to you, do I talk to the camera? Am I supposed to look at it, what? You can just talk to me, let's just have a conversation. Just ignore the camera, faggot! Yeah, fly on the wall, fly on the wall. All right, let's go. You fucking kike nigger, gook, cunt. Why don't you just say your name, just tell us your name. Why? Why does it matter? I don't know, I guess it doesn't, it's just, you know, a name. Names don't mean shit. You know how many aliases I've used calling into radio shows? Names don't matter, it's what fucking someone says and someone does that fucking matters. I hate my name, fuck my name. Why are you here? What are you after? I thought you knew, you know, our mothers both. Yeah, yeah, I get it. Your mom has her head filled with nonsense every Sunday along with that incontinent monstrosity of mine upstairs, you heard about me, I get it, but I mean what's your angle? What, you mean for the doc? I just thought it was really interesting, you know, that someone hasn't left their basement in six months, not even to use the bathroom, is that true? Why would I wanna go out there? A man's home is his castle. I got everything I need right here. What's out there for me? I don't know, other people? Other people, you fucking kidding me, right? What in the fucking would I want or need other people for? I'm my own man, I know how to exist and thrive without aid. That's what's wrong with society, that's what's wrong with most people, they're weak will pussies and parasites who buy into that whole fucking it takes a village bullshit, 'cause they can't stand on their own fucking feet, I stand on my own two feet. Right? It's obvious that I'm not trying to be, man, don't get me wrong but like, I'm just acknowledging that and you, in fact, live in your mom's basement. What? No, no, no, no, no, get it straight motherfucker, this is my house, my father left it to me, he fucking despised her as much as I do. It's only out of the kindness of my own heart that I let her stay here and trust me every day I dream about throwing her fat-ass to the wolves. She is your mother and on some level you still love her, right? Love? Fuck no, love. Maybe 20 years ago I would have thrown her out, but I couldn't do it now, not even to her, not with the roving pack of fucking niggas and everything else that moved in and took over. This neighborhood, like every neighborhood in every city in this goddamn country has gone to shit. Even my cunt mother doesn't deserve that. Probably mercy kill her first. Oh, okay, all right. How do you survive? Don't you rely on her at all? How do you make a living or like eat and shit? I'm a miner. I pan for gold in them nareos, cryptocurrency motherfucker, ever heard of it? Okay, gotcha. Like Bit coin. So, you have mining first day like can gaze but it's still engaging society some way, right? I get where you're going with this kid, don't. Bet your ass I could survive in the wild, I can kill, dress a deer, I can fish, don't you worry about me, I got every item and every skill it'll take when the time comes. When not if, you mean like Thursday like it'll happen in a lifetime. Lifetime, it'll happen in the next two fucking years. We are weeks away from this bullshit election and I know you don't wanna hear this but Donald Trump is gonna win the election and then he's gonna take office and then, might not happen immediately but it's coming, 'cause those niggas get more and more uppity every fucking day, black lives matter and all this other bullshit, that is going to lead to the race war that will end all race wars, we have unfinished business. Civil War was just the fucking beginning, this shit's been brewing for decades. Wow. Not sure what to say there. What's the matter? What did you think this was? What did you think you were walking into? Some fat slob playing video games in his mom's basement? You were gonna make your little movie or a documentary exploiting him? Wrong basement, homeboy, wrong guy. But you aren't going anywhere yet, no matter how vile you think I am, how fucked up and damaged or misguided or evil, you're in for the long haul, you're hooked. I can see it in your eyes. Oh, oh, so, I just got out of there and this dude, he's he's a fucking trip. He's the real deal I think, man, I thought it was just gonna be some fucking loser like sitting in his basement like playing into some video games or some shit but it's a fucking bunker down there, and like, he's for real, man, he's fucking serious, and like fucking, he's like raw man. He's like mining the real raw shit, man, he's down in there and so, I think if I go down there and that I'm willing to like, you know, like listen to him like he's a real human being there, we can, you know, there's something there that we all need to learn and you know, hear him and really look past all the fucking and like see what's really wrong, man, like, there's some like, like, you know, there's some disconnect there and if I can find it, we can really, like, or I can, well, yeah, something's there and now's the time to get in there and like, show over the world, like this fucking mole that has buried himself in the fucking dirt, you know and like, I don't know. Okay, this guy is, he's, it's like pure hate, man, this is like the drug of hate and like, if we can just, kind of, figure out how he's getting high off of it, maybe we can start like, pulling that shit back off of him, man. It's hate that we're in a fucking high and this dude is fucking hot for that shit, daily, and can just like, you know, chew it like a drug, chew it like a drug and just break through that shit, figure it out, you know, it's like a science project, you know? It feels like, you got a science fair shit and I'm gonna make it my little project and you know, figure this shit out. What is hate? Where does it come from? Where does it go? Yeah. Right now it's fucking caged. Nigga's fucking caged his own head and just shaking it, shaking his own fucking cage, it's absurd. Fucking absurd. You're right, you're not what I expected and I'm hooked. Tell me more about these radio shows you're calling into. You wouldn't have any of those tapes, would you? Oh, yeah, tons of them. Hey, loyal listeners, this is the Grind and Run with Steve. Steven Richmond, tell me what's grinding your gears tonight. Steve, you there? I'm here. You wanna know what grinds my gears, Gary? Where to begin. Let's start with the swelling tide of blue blood bleeding heart libtards who bend over backwards to apologize on behalf of Muslims every time one of these rag heads opens fire on innocent Americans. Last month, it was Paris, fine, I'm no fan of the French and that's an ocean away on our TV screens but last week, last, last week, it was San Bernardino back in our home turf in our own backyard, this gutless camel jockey and his worthless wife killed 14 of my countrymen in cold blood, how at a party for Christ's sake? 14 on the floor and today, today on the anniversary of Pearl Harbor, only Donald Trump has the courage and conviction to stand up and publicly say what needs to be said and these spineless waves on the left, when crucified for it, we're here safety, goddamn right, we need to lock our borders down yesterday. We didn't learn our lesson in 93 when I was Osama bin Laden took a shot at the Twin Towers, we gave him a loose leash and that dog bit. When are we gonna wake the fuck up? No, I'm sorry, Steve, I'm thinking that we're laying down here but we can't have that kind of language. When are we gonna wake up and realize that inclusive is what brought down Troy? You let your guard down, you have no one to blame but yourselves. This is a failure of leadership and it's no surprise that Barack Hussein Obama and his lame duck do nothing flunkies let it happen over and over and over again. Seven years we went without an attack since this great nation's birthday in O two until he took office and then what did you get? Little Rock, Fort Hood, Boston Marathon, Chattanooga and now the latest. While he's spying on you collecting your metadata, what did it get you? 14 on the floor, that's what it gets you. Well, it's time we put our foot down, I say, I'll be damned if it happens again, not on my watch, not in my yard. I am locked and I am loaded and I am prepared to defend myself and my own land and every one of your listeners better be too, because it's not going to get any better until we stand up and say, enough is enough. We're tired of these glass jaw apologies on behalf of murderers. We're sick of the crying or the torture at Gitmo, the greatest generation knew better than to open that door. Again, 73 years ago today, we were attacked and what did we do? We rounded those squeaky-eyed sons of bitches up and tossed them in camps, and locked down the borders to their kind, no entry. That is the answer and say what you want about the man, but at least Trump has the intestinal fortitude to stand up and say what needs to be said, no more! We are at war. For the first time since the 1700s, a foreign enemy is attacking us on our own soil, what are you gonna do about it? What are you going to do, Gary? What are your listeners gonna do? Lock and load. I'm ready and I will not hesitate. Are you advocating violence? Steve, we can't... - You're goddamn right I am. Until the f nigga in charge gets his nappy head out of his black ass, I am fully prepared to kill and to die to defend my country. This is a bedtime story I like to call tranny faggot fox. You want to know what gender you are, reached down the front of your fucking pants, if you have an innie, you're a girl, if you have an outie, you're a boy, end of fucking story. What other species of animal dreams up this kind of preposterous shit? A male lion is a male lion regardless of how he feels. Presume there's gonna be fucking urinals in lady's room just because some maladjusted, sicko fuck got off on wearing mother's lipstick and pearls and never bothered to grow up, it doesn't mean the rest of us have to play along. These fucking monstrosities, sorry, but Bruce Caitlyn Jenner is not brave and if you think he/she is, you're a fucking flaming faggot water head liberal fucktard. It's ridiculous, Jesus Christ! Next thing you know, niggas are gonna wanna start using the same water fountains as the rest of us. Oh, wait, that slippery slope is what led to this. I've got a million more in here, man, anytime you wanna hear, anytime you wanna fucking hear it. This has got all the truth you need. Okay, let's backtrack. You never leave this basement, so, tell me, how do you spend all that free time down here? Can you like walk me through, I don't know, a day in the life of Ronald. I get up, morning faggots and a special wakey, wakey eggs and Bakey to all you niggas, immigrants and cunts. I put my boots on, it is a beautiful day in the neighborhood. Could I be? Might I be your neighbor, neighbor? Let's go. You want a day in the life? First stop on our tour is this room where my father blew off his fucking head when I was 13 years old. My old bedroom is located directly above this room. Stop number two is my mother's shit. Like I told you, she was allowed to be a teacher, this is some of her shit from then. Over here is where I do my business. I take the morning piss, freshen up, wash my balls, shower, shit, shave, get some water coffee, maybe I'd do a little light reading or writing while I listen to radio. Usually get in a little workout before I eat, pushups, swinging kettle bell and some metrics. Figure out what to eat. I make everything a little fast, cook it, eat it then play a little bass. Fucking stop! Fuck you! Oh, you wanna see something really fucking cool? This is some of my dad's old shit. You're gonna love this. 4th of July was his favorite holiday. He used to run around with these sparklers wearing this Abraham Lincoln mask. This, make sure you get this, man, this is a real kicker. Oh, fuck! Look at that. Yeah, that's nice. You got enough of this bullshit reenactment garbage? Who gives a fuck what I eat? I have shit to say, man, you wanna hear it or not? Niggas have never shown an aptitude for anything but murder, theft, rape, slinging dope and rioting every time a good cop takes out the trash. To shit on niggas is not to dehumanize them, they aren't fucking human! Faggot. Faggot. Faggot, faggot, fucking faggot, fucking nigga, cunt. You fucking kike dyke gook, faggot. You don't get to own words you fucking straw grasping pussies, you cannot take them back, they were never yours to goddamn begin with. You fucking people do not even understand the origins of these words that you hold so dear. All this harping about slavery, do you call horses slaves? Do you call cows slaves? Calling it slavery infers that they are in some way equal or even the same species, stop it. Remember that Congressman, who the fuck was it? Doesn't matter, I don't remember. Anyway, the guy used the word niggardly and he was fucking forced to resign. Let me get this straight, you can't even use a word that sounds fucking phonetically similar to one of these off limits hate speech words. 40,000 years ago the Caucasoids broke off from the Mongolians, whites are descended from that brave renegade tribe. A tribe of trailblazers and conquers and pioneers, that's how far it's gone. They're keeping score at home, man. Niggardly means to hate spending money or to be cheap, like, you know, a fucking mealy mouth Jew. We moved to colder climates, we crossed oceans, we tamed new wilds, domesticated animals, mastered metallurgy. We fucking evolved while the African Mongoloid stayed the same pathetic primitive creature it always was. You know the entomology of the word faggot, dude? No one knows this, even faggots don't fucking know this, it's old English, it means a bundle of sticks. Why do we bring them out of Africa? Why didn't we just leave them there? Because there was a time that whites, before we got addicted to guilt, could see niggas for what they really are, cattle. Dogs and wolves can fuck and make offspring but let's understand and recognize that that does not make them the same species, so, don't give me fucking mulattoes and half-breeds as some kind of evidence that were the same. Did some slave owners fuck their niggas out by the woodshed? Of course, same as Australians fuck sheep. You asked me, Jefferson was a fucking beast Opheliac. This country put a goddamn cattle fucker on a coin, chew on that cud, homeboy. Now, the fucking cry baby faggots and trannies and everybody they'll have you believing that it's some bigoted thing about burning faggots at the stake with the sticks, ever the victim, right? Bullshit. Or they'll tell you it's about a bundle of sticks being representative of fucking what? Like all the dicks, all together like in a fucking gay nightclub. And don't give me melanin either, it's not just color, man, it's not just pigment, this shit is phenotypic. Kinky nappy fucking hair, ashy skin flared animal nostrils, a propensity for mindless animal violence, sickle cell, the big nigga asses, it's a high hip to waist ratio. Their prognostic jaws, their big fucking blunt sucking lips, their long monkey arms and soulless idiot eyes, don't give me human. You see, faggot started as a derogation of women. We referred to them as a burden, like, oh, I don't know, a bundle of wood, useless, they don't carry their own fucking weight, they are baggage that we have to haul around while we get shit done, see. It takes an average IQ of 90 to run a technological nation and that's why Africa is still goddamn jungles and deserts and why they still carry their water in woven baskets on their empty monkey heads. They have all the goddamn resources, coltan, lithium, cassiterite, they're sitting on a fucking goldmine and they're too stupid to realize it, meanwhile, China's swoops in and suck some dry for fucking custodial gigs, it's a disgrace. So get over yourselves you fucking fairies, you're just annoying little limp wristed nats. No one gives a shit if you live or die, so, shut the fuck up, enjoy your AIDS in peace so, the rest of us can get on with our existence. Enough with the parades and the rainbow flags. You are a nuisance, not a course. In reference, I wish that cunt would shut the fuck up. Keep rolling, fuck this, fuck it, I'm not done. The framers figured it out, they gave them three fifths, you are three fifths of a fucking person, that's it, and that was generous. This woman cannot shut the fuck up, you hear this? One of this days you're gonna show up here and you're gonna help me bury a fucking body. They had it right back then, that's what I call a faggot, useless, in the way, too much work, a suck on society and fucking decency. It's not just faggots, queers and trainees that are faggots by the way, women are faggots, feminists are faggots, niggas are faggots, welfare queens are faggots, crack babies are faggots, the police are faggots, priests are faggots, finger fucked alter boys are faggots, politicians are faggots, the school board are faggots, teachers are fucking faggots, hedge funders are faggots, the toothless fuck trying to get a dollar out of me at the gas station is a faggot. Border hopping, job deeps are faggots, the weak stupid earth worshipers who couldn't stop us from stealing their land, faggots. Refugees are faggots, retards are faggots, kike speaks slopes are fucking faggots. The French, total white flag-waving faggots Muhammad and Jesus, circle jerking faggots. Camel jockey, ISIS, terrorists, fuck some faggots, and last but not least white liberal fucking faggots, you do deserve to be burned at the stake. Race traitor faggots. He used to love wearing these fucking rings. Oh, my God, he was, I think it's 'cause he couldn't wear them like when he was working 'cause he was an electrician, you know? So, he would get a finger blown off if he was wearing all this metal but he used to walk around. He used to fucking walk around with like three of these things on like this and he'd go down to the liquor store and he'd go and get his fucking gin and sit there. These rings on all of them. My old man was smart, was rash, a tinker, an electrician. He was very scientific, he had a very logical approach to everything. Everything was schematics and flow charts so, you could, you can actually believe everything he said, it all made sense, but he wasn't perfect. How do you mean? He was weak? How so? He always took the easy way out, always compromised. You think compromise makes you weak? No, it doesn't make you weak, it's a sign you're weak, a symptom, another is attempting to escape reality. You don't run from reality and you don't make deals with it, you put its teeth on the curve and shape it with the downward thrust of your fucking heel. My old man ran from everything. He ran from that fat fucking idiot harpy nag upstairs, he hid down here in his fucking workshop. A grown, a grown man hiding. He ran from society when it started prioritizing handouts to niggas and illegals over rewarding hardworking Americans, he ran from his fucking responsibilities with a boozy and he ran for reality like a fucking head in the sand libtard kami faggot when he put a bullet in his brain, this one. He was wearing this one when he did it. You see that right there, you're getting that where it's cut, that's what they do when they have to cut a ring off of someone's dead body, he was wearing this one. I don't know why I hate them, look at all these rings, son. Are you different? You're not hiding down here like you said he did but. You think I'm hiding down here? I'm not hiding, yet, I'm biding my time. You're gonna shape your own reality from down here? Oh, yeah. I got big things in store, don't you worry about me. What do you think I am glad like some afraid of them, you think I'm fucking scared? Oh, contraire, motherfucker, they need to be afraid to me. I don't go out there because it turns my fucking stomach, it disgusts me. Fucking faggots making out in the street in broad day light, race traitors and niggas fucking holding hands, making fucking mutant babies. Loud mouth cunts constantly bitching and moaning about equality while men hold doors open and buy them meals and let them off with fucking warnings instead of speeding tickets. Spineless, cock social justice retards turning every fucking word in the dictionary into a goddamn landmine. No, they should consider themselves lucky. Next time I go out there, you better watch your fucking six and batten down the fucking hatches, 'cause I'm coming out guns blazing. Was this a violent household you grew up in? What, physically? No. I'd have killed them in their fucking sleep. Emotionally? Man, she's a fucking nightmare. Look at this shit. This is basically the inside of her head. All cotton brain fucking button-eyed idiocy, fake fucking flowers, dust covered little kid shit. She's a child, a fat piss-dripping Jesus-loving child with her trinkets and her fucking figurines and shit, watch it, watch it. She will be yelling down any day now. Listen, fucking October for me to set up the fucking Christmas tree, mark by words. What's emotional abuse, anyway? Pussy faggot shit, excuses to fail, to hand over power. She wasn't abusive, she's just a fat fucking nag who will drive you to kill yourself if you let her. You really do hate your own mother, don't you? - I mean, she's a woman, why wouldn't I? We're on with Jack, Jack in Dear born, what's on your mind? You're not gonna like it. Try me. I've had it up to my goddamn gills with the systematic feminization of this country. Ooh, this should be good, buckle up folks. There you go. More condescension, surprise, surprise. I can't watch the news these days without some commercial giving us this pathetic dumbed-down purse-holding lug of a husband and his all knowing suburban Oracle wife to make the fallacious point, that we men don't know or care about anything beyond beer or breasts and only Athena herself can make the decision to choose the right minivan or laundry detergent or goddamn snack chip for the family. We men who incidentally brought you everything, from fire to farming, from the compass to the cotton gin, steam engine and electricity and the light bulb and refrigeration and... War and slavery and rape, don't forget rape. I mean you even do it to each other when we don't let you near us anymore. I am talking here. My, my, are we a prickly one, Jack? Lady, you don't know that half of it and I'm not alone, you think we don't understand what this is? I'm with her, I could fucking puke. Language, strike one. Hate to break it to you, sweetheart, but it's time to reconcile. Dom loves the country over are waking up to the rules. We know they're spoon feeding us, Hillary Clinton. Not the nefarious they and who would they be? The NSNBC, CNN Better Homes and Gardens? - Please, I'm talking Bohemian Grove, the Bilderbergs and the Rothschilds. All three? Open your eyes. Power's already been consolidated, it's all hold'em to them now. It's been the slow play years in the making and we're coming up on the river, but lo and behold along comes this articulate black to upset the applecart. Libtards and social justice faggots fall all over themselves to signal their most virtuous of virtues and elect car-baby Berry Hussein to what? Right the wrong of slavery? But we're right back on schedule now, aren't we? Spent the last 20 years portraying women as the most reasonable and measured and presidential of people because you creatures are so known for tempering your emotions and making rational decisions, meanwhile, making men out to be dead weight, the buffoons, the butt of the joke. Oh, I think you gentlemen do a pretty bang up job on that. Do you wanna know what I think? I think you are overpaid at 70 cents on the dollar. I think you are weak and inferior and I think you know it. You don't see any couches in the men's room bitch. Case in point. You wanna get real? Let's get real. On top of being the buffoon, now we don't even get to be the strong ones. This is the emasculation I'm talking about. Now, we get, men could never handle the pain of childbirth. Well, riddle me this, bad girl, if you women are so tough and can take pain so well, how come I'm not allowed to punch you in the face once in a while, when you run your clueless whore mouth? Okay, this little gel sting match has been fun. When Trump wins this election, you'll have no one to blame but yourselves. Blow back, baby, you earned it. Stop shoving chivalry down our goddamn throat, stop voting with your snatches and maybe we'll let you stay when we kick these goddamn rag heads out of the country. Jesus! Someone get that guy a Thorazine. I mean, I need to scrub that one off of me so, I'm gonna go lie down on that couch in the ladies room to decompress for a moment, but before I leave you with a word from our sponsors, if any of you plan to call in and behave like that, to talk over me and scream and yell, don't. Don't call here, ever. Don't call anyone, get your own damn show if you think you've got that much to say. Come on in, get in here. Now, how you like that fucker? Are you ready for me today? Huh, yeah, I'm ready for you today. I went to real school. - Did you go to school? Come on, it's how you like it? You liked this? - Is that an eight millimeter? Yeah, it's an eight millimeter. I like it, it's a nice camera, I have one like that. I can get it to work for you. - What's your name? Dude, we've met like five times. What's your name? You don't like that shit, do you? Names are important, remember? My name is Chris. I like long walks on the beach. Yeah, Chris what? Sandberg. Sandberg, what, you a fucking Jew? No. I'm sure as hell isn't Irish, what is it? You probably a half kike, right? Tell me about your mother, how do you get along with your mother? - She's great, - Come on, let's get on this side. - We really Mahjong I guess, in the park together. You play Mahjong with your mom? - No, I don't. - Yeah? - No. - It's your old man alive? Yeah, he's alive. - Yeah? - Yeah. Does he hate your fucking mother too? - Probably. - Yeah? They're divorced. So, how does this feel having a camera in your face? Start talking, talk. - This feels all right. - Tell me what you think, how do you feel about niggas? You like niggas? - No, never. - Huh? No, you don't? - I mean. Then why are you so shocked when I tell you the truth about them? You need to grow up, kid? - They never mess with me man. - You need to grow the fuck up They ain't never messed with you. Ah, that's sweet, that's sweet. No, they're generally, I like their, some of their music is good. They? What do you mean, they, who's they? Who's they? - The black peoples. - The black people, okay. - Yes. The peoples that make up for us in this country anything. Yeah, you think women should have... - I'm all in on you, man. - You think women should have an equal share? You think women should have equal share? You tiki wheel grilling me about that shit before. - Well, yeah. - Huh? Yeah? - Yeah. I've met some smart women. - No, you haven't, no, you fucking haven't. What about? That's pussy liberal talk shit. I'm trying to stay impartial. - Yeah, why? - Yeah, I... 'Cause. - Why? Life's not about impartial, we are at war. So, Chris the Jew, when you think about Muslims? What do think about niggas? - I don't know if I've ever really talked to a Muslim. What do you think about niggas? - They're great. - Yeah, what do you think about, they're great? - No, I mean. - If you need cotton picked they're great, or if you wanna watch a fucking basketball game, they're great. - What do you want me to say? Why don't you say how you feel, I want you to step up and be a fucking man and tell me what you think of niggas. Well, right now I'm feeling a little, I think, maybe I'll come back another day. - Yeah? - How about I'll just, can you just? - Yeah? What do you think of Mexicans? I love Mexican food. You love Mexican food so they can cook for you. So, you'll get your cotton picked, you'll get your food made. What do you think about niggas? Be honest, be honest. Don't say what you're supposed to fucking say, be honest. I am scared. - Of niggas? - No. I mean, you got like 50. - I was telling the truth, what? How many guns you got downstairs, man? You're blocking the exit here, man, like, what do you want me to say? ' Cause... I want you to man up and say what you think. And all the while, you're putting me in a weird position, man. I didn't do this to you. - You must be some kind of mom, boy. Probably suckled that tit till you were like fucking 11. Ah, wait, what? Just your utter disbelief that I could hate my mother, that anyone could hate their mother, like any two fucktards with a cock and pussy can't make a fucking baby. Like it's inconceivable to you that just because I came out of her greasy stupid snatch and I would wanna gouge her fucking eyes out and shut the life out of her someday, that's a story as always time, man, that's fucking arastes. You don't get it, your mother's annoying? Good for you, that monster of mine up there, she's a fucking rattlesnake. Okay. All right. Here's a little insight for you. I cannot count how many times I came home as a kid to find her laying there on the couch or on the bed or the floor, eyes wide open but still as death, not breathing, maybe a pill bottle open and scattered on the floor, maybe some other prop. I would go to her and shake her and I'd start to cry and then, you know, only after she got me to cry, she fucking double over laughing that fucking cackling jackal laugh of her is just, I got you, I got you. She pulled that shit countless times, just got to the point that if I saw her laid out like that, I would just walk right fucking by her hoping that it was true for once and that I would be done with her, and trust me, man, that is just the tip in the fucking iceberg with her, don't fall for her diary old church lady routine, she is an evil cunt. Stick around long and you'll see. You know what I like to do sometimes? I like to lock and load and trace her when she walks around. Oh, she's going onto the sink, to the bathroom. Got you. She's coming this way. This is where it gets fun. There she comes, right above us and then she's gonna sleep in the bed. One of these fucking days, man. Okay. This guy is a fucking animal and he's got himself he's got himself on a leash and he's fucking gnawing at it and he's itching, he's itching to get off of that fucking leash and he's gonna fucking kill some people, man, and I'm gonna be first, so, if I'm gone, you'll fucking know why. So, if you find this phone somewhere I probably won't be far. Fuck. Oh, who's that? Kathy's boy, your little friend? He's a loser like you, the both of you, worse... Fuck you! Why are you making a movie about him anyway? What's so special about my loser cunt? - Cunt? - It's not a good time, man, I can... - No, no, fuck her, let's go. - Fuck me? Fuck you you ungrateful. Why can't you get a job, like job. 'Cause you're a loser, that's why. What an excuse of a man, look at you, look at him. I ask one thing, I ask one thing, you can't even bring up the Christmas tree. - It's fucking October! - Losers! You can't even help your own mother, his own mother. My, god. Both of you, losers, a span of losers. I'm fucking going to her. You know what? Shut the fuck up! Oh, fuck! Shit! Never! Never a job traveling out in the world I'll show you, huh! It's no wonder no one loves you, why no woman ever wanted you. Look at you, you low life. You have sired yourself nothing. How do you get married in a fucking basement with the spiders and the rats? That's where you belong like a moron hiding from the world just like your father, your moron father! Shit! That's not very nice. - Submitting like a coward. Is it going to have to give to get in somewhere right now? No one likes you. You hate me, I hate you! I hated you since I birthed you, I hated you from the moment you were born. I couldn't wait to get you out of me, I wish you were stillborn. I wish you could have died and it wasn't just me, your father hated you, he was ashamed of you we both were. Shame on you... - I'm gonna fucking shut her up for good. - Shame on you. Dude, dude! Pun it down. Stop, man, stop, don't do it man, fuck, put it down, stop, man, stop! Don't do this, it's not fucking worth it, man. Die! Oh, shit, stop, man, stop, would you? Oh, fuck! I didn't see shit, man. Come here! No, don't Tommy, I'm so sorry. Who are you? I can drive, run, man, You know, I would, you could just take the footage, man, you can just take it all, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna head out, man, just keep all this shit, man, I was never here. You know, I never saw shit. I didn't see shit, man. - But you did. No, fuck, no! My, my, what have we here? You're mine now shit birds. Nice little church lady, Christopher's saying... We're just talking to you and now what are you doing, what are you doing? Say it, look at the fucking camera and say it. - No. - You are cutting her arm to cover your tracks, you say that, fuck. - Let me out of here. - Nope. Sorry, kid. I'm not done with you just yet. Just let me out of here. As long as I haven't figured all the fucking shit you were shooting. - No. - You think I'm your little project? - No. A libtard, a faggot? Piece of shit. You are mine. Little project you rat, fuck. I didn't do anything, I didn't do anything. Just let me go, please, stop. No, no, no fuck you, fuck you. Smile, faggot, you're on candid camera. Wake up slave. Imagine that's the worst thing you do. Go on, pick it up. Up here, Spielberg, on me. We're gonna show them the life you live. We're gonna change the world. Spielberg, pan up. - There's no pan to tilt up. - Shut the fuck up, you know what I want, tilt it up then. Get this, make sure you can get all this. Make sure you get all of this. You guys are gonna love this shit. This is Cactus Jack coming to you live from a studio audience. Hallo, fucktards. Moment of truth, libtards, time to point out today's hypocrisy namely, how you nutless cocks constantly preach inclusivity on the one hand with your endorsements of racial desegregation and co-mingling to the point of populating the planet with meat and half-breeds of every stripe and then engaging your misguided half-assed white savior dances with niggas identity politics act that throws around bullshit terms like cultural appropriation and cultural heritage. One day you say we should all fuck each other until everyone is a light butterscotch brown and racism is relegated a relic of the barbaric past, and then the very next day, if not minute, you're talking out of the other side of your week, white guilt mouths about how darkies should be allowed to take the California achievement test in fucking Bionics or Spanglish or fucking clicks and worlds or whatever other mongrel language is the flavor of the day. You make a protective species of these shit stains but then deny me my right to pride in my own race. You'd give them a month where we get Frederick Douglas and Dr. King and what the fuck was he a doctor of anyway? Adultery? And that tar baby raising that Harriet Tubman crammed down our throats and say, the other 11 months are white history months, bullshit! There is no more reviled figure in the country these days than the white male, thanks to you race traitors, and you wonder why these cornered animals lash out and shoot up their schools and movie theaters, it's because every white girl has been brainwashed by MTV and BET to think Moon crickets where a third grade reading level are their ideal mates. And on top of it, they're told that the greatest ill on society is what they are, not the droves niggas shoplifting and boosting cars and killing each other in Chicago, it's Brad in the burbs. Go to the fucking program, you don't get to draw lines in the sand and then fucking straddle them, pick a fucking side because it's too late. You know damn well when the war comes, we are locked and loaded and ready to take this country back with fire and righteous fucking fury jackass. Wake up. God! - No. Let's talk about Flint, shall we? A democratic stronghold. Birthplace of that incontinent whining whale, Michael Moore, and they've got more lead in their pipes that Robby the fucking robot. These liberal skunks are the personification of evil. They pander to the uneducated and impoverished, tell them they'll save them, prop them up, and bolden them to reach new heights and grasp hold of the American dream, all the while, poisoning our water, poisoning our children's minds and brainwashing fucking public schools boards, poisoning the media, it's all poison. Look alive, faggot. Get it all, that's all you get there you go, there you go. Oh, I bet that feels good. I bet you are starving, come on, do you want some beans? You want some beans? Here's what you do with Baltimore, you put a wall around it and you let the Silver backs tear each other apart, end of story. When they're done, we turn it into a parking lot. Parking problem solved, monkey problem solved, you're welcome America. That's right, folks, today we're talking victim braining. Remember, the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a badder guy with a bigger gun, be the badder guy, be a warrior, be the wolf. I'm an Islamophobe the same way a battered, abused woman would be afraid of the guy who punched her in the fucking mouth. Do you call cows slaves? Calling niggas slaves infers that they're equal in some way or the same species, stop it, Jack out, Jack out, Jack out. Another basement ball buster all by himself, mommy's upstairs cooking your fucking cream of wheat. This motherfucker sits around with this Nazi flags and paraphernalia. I hope you find out who this guy is and shut him down. These niggas and these goddamn kikes think they run this goddamn fucking world. Look at where we are. Look. I got the guns, the dogs, I got everything I need. Fuck this goddamn 'cause y'all gotta fucking figure this shit out. I understand the kikes rule the fucking money and the goddamn niggas think they're owed something, we don't owe them nothing. Stupid niggas. I read your comments shit birds, I see all your hurled insults, your lame virtue signaling and pathetic posturing, you decry me as a racist, a textbook example of the pot calling the nigger black as I've ever seen, without having the fucking balls to admit you're no different than me, shut the fuck up, be a man and admit that a nigga is a lower life form and a tranny is a fucking mentally ill faggot and all the rest of the universal truths you're too much of a fucking brown nose punk bitch to say it out loud, fuck you, grow a pair. This is a call to arms, put these monkeys and sand niggas and border hoping Mexican narco shitbergs down before they overrun the place. This is a responsibility, lock and load like warriors. Jack, you're gonna love this. So, this nigga, he come running up, we come running up, we put a 45 to his motherfucking head and he bloody stomped on his goddamn fingers. That nigga fell and he fell, fell hard, 28 feet. Watched that motherfucker fall, he didn't give up, I put a 45 through his fucking head and that stupid nigga didn't have a goddamn chance, all he tried to do was hold on, it's all he's trying to do as we sat there and laughed. Fucking awesome. I pulled the trigger on that motherfuckers head and that is how he fell. Look at me, look at me! Look at me! Welcome to boot camp. Yes, the cactus Jack show has been canceled. However, it's been replaced by a fine mid season replacement, ladies and gentlemen, get ready for the hottest new game show around, Wheel of Torture. Our contestant today is Chris, a half kike and a faggot from Fayetteville, North Carolina. Chris, it's great to have you as always, let's give the wheel a spin. I said let's give the wheel a spin. Let's give that wheel a spin and goes all round and round she goes, where she stops, nobody knows. Oh, it's one of my personal favorites, it's why you're acting the way you are, it's a little more liquid wrench. You know what to do, kid, breathe it in. Breathe it in. Oh. Oh, there you go. The crowd goes wild. Oh, and blame it on drink piss, always a favorite of mine, come on, Chris, drink that piss. Drink it. Drink it, drink it! Drink it, all of it, drink it. Drink it! Yeah, yeah. Oh, fuck, yeah. Fuck yeah. Yeah, drink it. Well, Chris, you've span another wild card, you know what that means, water boarding, always a crowd favorite. Oh, yeah, drinking this, you like it, you like it. For fucking spilled you, Chris, come on. On bowels, you know what that means, Chris, now, breathe through your nose, breath through your nose, suck it and suck it, suck it. Close your eyes, close your eyes. Yeah. So, look at you. You are gonna be so fucking raw, yeah, raw. There you go, yeah, fight. Fuck! Mother! Still, with your eyes closed. Yeah, let me see. You're gonna love what comes next. ♪ You don't have to talk ♪ That's it. Come on, baby, you're showing a little part. Look at the camera, look at the cameras. The camera next to you, kid. Your sham election is a week away, the noise is unbearable. The frenzy hubris of the left, they have somehow convinced themselves Hillary Clinton is going to win. They believe the average able minded American wants that goddamn meat puppet for a figure head, that lying duplicitous ladder climbing cunt. This old bag can't even stand up straight without some Bilderberg fist up her ass, like literally, she's falling all over the goddamn place hitting her head left and right, forgetting which way she's waffled and every fucking policy just flip flopped over in her dog shit career, and you want this geriatric power monger matriarch as your leader, what? Because she has a fucking moth balled sausage wallet and a bottle of Louisiana hot sauce and a designer purse? This bitch isn't even a fucking woman, she's a robot programmed by cockroaches. If she was a real woman Bill wouldn't have resorted to porking miss piggy with a Cuban in the oval office, She'd have satisfied him. She'd take a step back and realize that a strong woman isn't one who wants to be seen or heard, but no, she and her flock unfuckable Kathleen heartbeats with their stupid cunt brains and their cunt faces, cunt voices, put their cankle hamhocks to the pavement and march for their pig queen all because Donald Trump has the balls to talk like a real fucking man. Grabbed by the pussy, that was locker room talk. Grow up, face reality, play to your strengths ladies 'cause leadership sure is shit, ain't it? Look at the children, we're raising monsters because these women are more concerned with being heard than rearing responsible well-adjusted free-thinking people you're teaching the entitlement you dark cunts. Get the fuck back in the kitchen. Most of you idiots can't even boil fucking water let alone change an oil filter. You're use less, all you're good for is marching and moaning, this needs to end. This whole movement needs to end and if she's their figure head, she needs to end too. Maybe that's it. Maybe one of you out there listening is man enough. Sacrifice himself to restore order. I'd do it myself but I'm needed here, speaking to truth as aunt Jamaima Oprah would say. But one of you, I know you're out there listening, you're on the wavelength, it's buzzing in your ears burrowing into your brain. It's not a task or a chore, it's a mission, a hero's journey. One of you needs to man the fuck up and do it, now, because as laughable an idea as it is to think she could win this stupid contest, this is in the end, the nation that did give you eight years of a Muslim nigga with an Armada of drones. You have seven days my proud white warriors, put a bullet in this fucking cunt, make it a million till there's nothing left. We will speak your name, Jack the fuck out. Cactus Jack, just call yourself what you are, a coward. - You think you're funny, man. To the man who calls himself Cactus Jack, we have watched as you have rocketed to infamy in a few short weeks via a supercharged site called Vitriolic Hateful Rhetoric. We have watched as you've published handcrafted propaganda and laid waste to your fellow man and woman for nothing more than arbitrary color of skin or country of origin or sexual identity and now, we have watched as you have called for literal blood, we will watch no longer, your days are numbered, your raspberry pie will not protect you. Your VPN would not shield you, the dark net will not hide you. We will find you, we will reveal you to the world. You and your kind are finished, we are Anonymous, we are Legion, we do not forgive, we do not forget, expect us. You think I'm scared of you? You must be out of your minds. I scare you. I'm the one in here, but you're the cornered animals. You're quaking in your boots. You think I'm afraid of you you rag headed camel fucking sand niggas? We'll come and get it, your 72 virgins await. And you, you toddler-killing blind-firing car-stealing dope-dealing black monkeys, you think I'm scared of you and your empty chest thumping threats with your black hoods and black boots and guts? Lamb's closing his lions, the whole fucking lot of you, come and get it. Your homeys can pour a 40 up in your honor when I put two in your chest and one in your nappy-headed skull. I thought you pansy ass hype-skirt blue-blood libtard fucks with your white guilt and your angry tweets and your sham elections, with your parading pink army of confused queers and cross-dressers and come belting, faggots, and your loud mouth harpy cunt women with a glass ceiling boo hoo hoo bullshit, come on, you know you want it, baby. Let's not forget you baby-eating reptilian world running Bohemian Grove Illuminati government fucks with your false flags and poisoned taps and overfilled cages, I know you're listening, I can hear you breathing, so come and fucking get it. You think I haven't been preparing for this my whole life? What do you think this is? You think I haven't killed before? I'm down here, microphone to mouth spitting truth out to you ignorant lost shit birds day in and day out and I got an army of my own, we are a rising tide, a nation with no borders hiding among you on your streets, in your neighborhoods and we're fucking sick of it. We're sick of your white-guilt, crybaby forced apology bullshit. We're sick of your shift with palms up out for a fucking handout, whiny nigga shit. We're sick of you're backwards desert drilling, stupid scumbag religions and you're stinking shitty birds nest beards and hypocrisy and pussy ass suicide bombs. Look me in my fucking eye you cowards. We're sick of your hand in our pockets and your picket fences and punch cards you fascist, empty headed, stuffed suit, corporate puppet politicians. You job stealing immigrant fucks. You dirty drunken rapist cholos and sad face Syrian leftovers, fuck you! Go home! Or better yet come here 'cause I got something for you too. You motherfuckers think I'm scared of you? I will give you my goddamn address, I'm right here, I'm waiting, so, come and fucking get me! Hey, Spielberg, so, you're notice our cat. Notice how citizens fucking came. I'm betting you saw that stupid fucking "Saw" movie there, didn't you? Kill your friend. Take care of the balls. Don't worry my jackhammers and jack offs, they ain't get me yet. I'm still kicking, coming to you live from the bunker. It's been six days since I've eaten unless you count the fucking spiders, four since I unplugged. I've had a lot of time to think these past few days to ruminate on things I've said, things I've done. Unspeakable things, things for which there can be no forgiveness, maybe it's the fucking mineral spirits, maybe it's the Holy Spirit, I don't know, I just know that we are all one, I see that now. I'm sorry that it took this, that it had to go so far to see but I now know that we are all one. We all bleed red, we're all one. One race, human beings joined together by happenstance or intelligent design, it doesn't matter, either way, we're here together on this rock hurtling through infinite space at unfathomable speeds made up of the stuff of stars. Each of us born innocent and perfect in our own way, like snowflakes, only later corrupted along the way by our lesser primordial evolutionary impulses, by competition, by fear and anxiety and self doubt, by ego. It's our responsibility as humans, as members of the human race to bask in the shared experience, to lend a hand no matter its color or creed, to help one another, to exist in harmony and peace and love above all else, for the children, if not for ourselves. Donald Trump is now our president as I foretold. You assholes said it was impossible. You hottie ignorant fucks, you bloated smug know nothings, I called it, I was right about that just like I'm right about everything else, but remember, that's not all I said was coming. With the Donald comes the final reckoning fucktards. Every fucking nigga, cunt, kike, spit, goop, libtard, faggot, all of you are gonna fry, lock and load my proud white warriors, stay vigilant, they're coming from me, they wanna silence me, they want me dead for giving voice to the same thoughts you had inside your heads every fucking day. That means they want you dead too. They wanna silence you same as me and not just your tongue and your mind, they wanna control what you're allowed to think let alone say, they wanna control what you can tell and teach your beautiful white children, they wanna be celebrated and they want you to pay but they're the ones who are gonna pay. They're coming for me and you, you, my jackhammers, you have a chance, you have right now to secure the safety of your banner and your race. You have a job and it's your responsibility as a member of the white... Wait, what the fuck was that, did you hear that?
