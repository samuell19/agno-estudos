A Shochiku Movie I am pleased to present the Shochiku movie, The Shy Deceiver. About a youth with many dreams, but frequent stumbles in this chapter of his life journey. Although I am not worthy, I am honored to have the opportunity to explain events as we go along. I trust that everyone will stay until the end, and enjoy the show at their leisure. THE SHY DECEIVER (Fukeba tobuyona otokodaga) The sun sets over the big city. The end of the day has arrived here in Osaka. Tired from their day's toil, workers gladly hurry back home. Soon, the City of Smoke will transform into the City of Neon. Red lights, blue lights, the colors of the big city at night. Like moths drawn to a flame, people are gathering for the pleasures of the night. Ah, all is well in the world. However, hidden behind the glamor and joy are the tears shed along this journey of life. Behold. Hidden in the light footsteps of the city's inhabitants, the fatigue of a heavy life. Although youngsters gather in joyful groups, their eyes are empty of color. But then who is not guilty of having had many dreams in their youth? Directed by Yoji Yamada Hey, sis, you look nice from the rear. Not so great from the front. This is the protaganist of our tale, the youth Saburo. Sorry to be late, dear Kaoru. You dumbshit, Sabu! Where the hell have you been? Taking a crap. Who said you could take a crap? Hey, bro, how about that chick? Where? With the colored glasses. Nah. That's a cross-dressing fag. What about her, with the bag? Probably a runaway. Nah, she's a pig. No good at all. Pig, horse, who cares? Looks aren't important. We just need to trick one. Trick? You think that's what we're doing? We're looking for talent. Talent. They're all the same. We just need to trick one. Hey, hey, hey. How about her? She's pretty. A good one. With the violin case. If you can snare her. Go for it. Right! Get away! Oh... Hey. Huh? What about her? That one, standing there. The one in yellow. Where? In front, in front. She's looking to the right. - Huh? - Turning left now. What? Behind the car. Look. Right there. That one. Oh... This girl is the heroine of our story, Hanako. Seeing the big city's hustle and bustle for the first time, her diminutive chest heaves with apprehension. What fate awaits her? I see. You're from Amakusa in Kyushu? My cousin is from Amakusa, too. He wants to go to the same university here that I go to. He's coming to Osaka. I was just waiting to pick him up. You must be hungry. Please eat something. Please eat. Is there something wrong? Um, I... I... Oh, the bathroom? Just down the hall. Excuse me. Hey, where are you going? Gotta watch her. Her stuff's here. She's not the type to slip out. Hey, do you think she's nuts? Yeah. She could work at a bar, but she's no good as talent. We're pros. We'll make her work. What the hell are you doing? That's for the kid. It's an investment. You are like pigs. Listen up. There's no time to train her. No rehearsals. Got it? Something wrong? Sorry. I just need paper. The birds are chirping, the sun is shining brightly. It's a wonderful day for an outing with friends. Youngsters in high spirits are enjoying their hike. All right, let's go. Come on, horse boy. Take her with you and start from there. OK. Come on, sis. Let's go. Okay, here we go. This is a run-through. Remember, film is expensive. And... start! Look like you are having a good time. You are college students. That's good. That's good. Okay, right there. Hug each other. Kiss I said "kiss". Oh, God, just forget it. Camera angle changes quickly to the guy in the sunglasses lurking. Take off your glasses. That's good, bro. You dumbshits. This is no joke. Do your jobs. Okay, let's go. Okay, go. You are having a good time. Ready? Here we go. Oh, come on. What's the matter with you? You are two lovers. Sweet lips is saying she doesn't know what we are doing. She's just shy. You lead. You are the guy. So, you've got a big cock, great. How about being an actor for once? This is color film. If the color temperature changes we are screwed. So, let's do it for real this time. Ready? And... start! Good, good. Hug and kiss there. - Take it easy, you guys. - Good. - What are you waiting for? - Kiss, kiss. Stop! - You didn't tell her anything, did you? - Correct. It's more realistic that way. That's really messed up. What's messed up about it? You goddamned said you wanted realistic rape. Right? Acting doesn't cut it. I said I wanted a documentary feel. But I'm not prepared to go that far. You can't seriously expect me to act with an amateur like that. Stop dilly-dallying about and start thinking about how to use the location. Yeah, she's an amateur, but I went to the trouble of getting her out here. You told me you wanted to make a film called "documeter". What about me? - What's my role? - What are you doing? Shove off! You hit me! You're dangerous. We've no choice but to shoot for real. Go tell her. All right. If you want to leave here alive get with the program now. Walk happily from over there. Go on! Umm, well, to tell the truth, I also want to quit. I've been doing sex films for a long time, but this is a disaster. I can't do it. - I quit. - Hey! You think this is just a scare tactic? - A total mess! - Yeah? I'll show you something real. Gonna do it? I'll do it. Get on with it. We're all set. Hey! You're supposed to be a lookout. All right, let's get started! OK, just relax. Hey, you! Don't run away. Damn! How many times do I have to say it? You moron! Wait! Damn! Sabu! What are you doing, you moron?! Get out of the way. Wait! Ki-yan, I'm going to do this myself. Roll the film. Hold her legs damn it. Okay. You need to know that I can't stop halfway. Help! Help! You bastard! Owww! You little shit. - Ouch! - Ow ow ow ow! Come here! Ki-yan! After her! Sabu, damn you! Moron! This way! Gus, Gus. You there? Gus! Why didn't you answer? Where'd they go? That way. What were you doing? I wanted to take a crap. Ouch! This way. Got it. Osaka next. Osaka. All right. Transfer at the next stop. You're going home, okay? OK. Hey, wake up. I'm not running and hiding. From now on, I'm following my gut. I'm standing up to them. We crossed the line out there, and now we have to face it like men. I don't mind. You don't have to follow me. Huh? What? Why haven't you gone home? I'm sorry. If you stay here, you'll get caught up with more weirdos. Yes. Sorry. Where she's going? Have you got a place to stay? I know a cheap, friendly inn. Want to check it out? But, I... Oh, you're from Kyushu. Great. There are people from Kyushu there. Let's go. Hey! Buzz off, buddy. She's got a place already. Oh, yeah? What do you think you're doing in my territory? Say what? Thanks. How much? 210 yen. What's this? Is this all you've got? You don't even have enough for a ticket home. Thanks. Okay, we're leaving. Thank you very much. Go this direction. Around the corner you'll see a police station. You'll see a strange neon sign, "Sonezaki Police Station". When you get there, you can figure things out. Gus. Bye-bye. What are you doing? She going to be okay? Who gives a shit? She's already in trouble. Dirty old man. What's up with you? You got a thing for that girl? Then, why don't you go help her? Otherwise, she's going with that dirty old man. Shit. Out of the way! Move! Hey! Who are you? What are you doing with her? Take your hands off my girl! That wasn't fast enough. You lousy pig. Hey, bud. Where d'you think you are? What's up with the fancy bag, hotshot? What's going on? What's this? Take this... You know who you are dealing with? You've got the wrong idea. I'm gonna mess you up. Hey! Hey! Come back here. Lousy four-eyes! You'll be sorry if we see you around here again. It's a joke, this pathetic amount. Huh? It's 10,000 yen. 10,000 yen! Look! 10,000 yen! Bro! 10,000 yen! Here we go. Here we go. We've got 10,000 yen! More dumplings and some sake. Got it! Gus, wake up! A couple of drinks and you're nodding off. Go home to your pigsty and go to bed. Get off her! Isn't this great? You've never had such good food. Two pig wombs! How long are you gonna hold that bag? Put it down. OK. Put it down now. That light's too bright. Leave me alone. What do you mean? Now is fine. There's someone out there. It's just me. That's a mirror. Mirror? You scared the hell out of me. Don't make noise like that. They'll hear you in the next room. What's up with this old bag? It's yours? It's my grandmother's. You borrowed your grandma's bag to come here? No mother? Right. She's dead? Aha. I'll bet she abandoned you. Right? So did my mom. Left me when I was ten. Where is she now? No idea. My dad used to call her a whore. So, maybe she is doing that somewhere now. You have a boyfriend? You must. There has to be some guy that you like. Did you at least kiss him? Huh? How was it? Huh? Where was it? How old were you? What? Huh! You really are a virgin. Say... Do you understand what was going on with those guys today? Huh! You really don't know, do you? Don't be an idiot. There's nothing to cry about. Hey, listen to me. I've got your back now. I won't let anyone do that to you. Thank you very much, brother. Mmm... What the...? Hanako. Even small birds have roosts, but the children of men have nowhere to rest their heads. These two poor little pigeons without a roost, how will they follow their dreams again tonight? Hey, Gus. Yeah? Is there any interesting place outside of Osaka? Hmm. Outside of Osaka? Hell, let's go big! The weather's nice, I've got some money. Great idea. Let's go. Right? The springtime of life. More beautiful than its name. A feeling never to be forgotten. Beautiful youth. Joyful youth. The flowers bloom and the birds sing in the spring of life. It's the morning glow of a life that shines brightly. You son of a bitch! Yikes! Sorry! Spring days are fleeting. Standing, looking out over Kobe harbor at sunset, the melancholy of youth creeps in. Let's go to my apartment, have some water, go to bed. Your apartment? We can't stay in that pigsty. A better idea is to make some money. You can do the faggot thing again. You know why his nickname is "Gus"? I'll tell you. Stop it, bro. A French guy, a sailor named Gaston, came on to Gus. The hatch was locked, and this huge guy chased Gus in circles like a rat. Strange story, huh? Why would anyone chase that face? What does "faggot" mean? Gus. Gaston. What is it? You need to pimp. Pimp? No way. It's okay. Just fake it like last time. Not in front of Hana. It's okay. She's clueless. You get it? I don't. Well... What if the guy is too much to handle? You just pick an easy target like last night. You know, forty-four, forty-five. Looks respectable, but is really a pervert. Dressed fine, wearing a hat. That type. Hey, boss. Mister. I'm not your boss or anything else. Sorry about that. Do you have a minute to advise me? Are you hungry? It's not me. It's a girl. Girl? Hotel Misuzu Don't worry. I've got her upstairs. Second floor. This way. This way. Please come this way. I'm back. I brought a friend. Come on in. This way. Good evening. Good evening. I've got an errand I have to run. Pops, take your time. Excuse me. I just... I just want to talk to her. So, have a seat and you can chat. - See you. - Hold on! Bro... Bro. You should go in soon. We have to wait until the old guy makes a move. Be patient. We don't want to spook him. Um... Well, then, I... I should be going. I see. I'm glad you came. Thank you. Well then, goodbye. Goodbye. Take good care. I will. She didn't do it. Useless! Moron! He can hear you. Leaving already? Stay, stay. Take your time. I have a pressing errand. Forget about that. Take off your jacket. You. Off with the slip. Hey, old man. What are you doing with my girl? Thinking about leaving? Who are you? Me? I'm her husband. Husband? I didn't do anything with your wife. Bullshit! You low life. Think you are better than us, asshole? You're going nowhere, bullshitter. I'm no bullshitter. I did nothing. I was just about to leave. Isn't that right, Miss? Right. Thank you, Miss. What are you trying to pull? So, what were you doing here? I came just to talk to this poor girl. Liar! I know you came here to do something nasty with her. You dirty pervert. Okay, okay. Maybe you're right. I had some thoughts of being with her. Well, I was lying. To myself. In that sense, I must be doubly punished. Come on, punish me. Tell me what I need to do. Tell me. Well, you should pay for this room. How much for that? 800 yen sounds about right. Brother, that's not enough. He's telling the truth now, so we go easy with him. Okay, here you go. Thanks. And take this, too. For what? I already said what you needed to give. I can't accept this. Don't be a fancy pants. Okay. Never mind. Well, I'll just go. Go home to your wife. Yes. Thank you. This was just a misunderstanding. You really are nice people. So, thank you. Goodbye, Miss. Thank you. I'm sorry. Damn it! Oh, well. Gus, get some beer. Good idea. Bring us some beer! That was a strange old guy, wasn't he? He said "Punish me." Creepy. Must be a neurotic. That's not right. He was a good person. I've given it a lot of thought. What do you think? What if I buy you some beer with the rest of that money? Still single at 45. That's rough. Please have some more. Thank you. We know some girls. No foreigners. They're too hot. Hot? Yes. We'll take you someplace good, just follow us. What good place? A good place. So good, you'll wet your pants. You have to go at least once while you are single. Okay. Take me there. Let's go! Idiot. You're staying here. Hanako, you just wait here. OK? New Turkish Eden Welcome! Momma, you there? Welcome! I brought a nice customer! - Got a good one? - Sure do. Everything you need. Mr. President. What's your type? Huh? What's that? Never mind. I'll choose for you. Midori... Akemi... Akemi, let's have a look. Pervert! What? What kind of place is this? It's a bath house. Hurry up and strip down. Then, what? The girl is going to take care of things. This old guy is special. Give him the full measure of your love. Got it. Special service, now. Do it like a sea cucumber. Which is the men's bath? This way. - Take care of him. - Where're we going? I brought you a good customer. That should be worth a beer. What a bunch of loser customers. How you doing, old man? Get out of here loudmouth. Sky's the limit. Do whatever you want. Idiot. Sky's the limit! We know. Get busy, hot lips. Idiot! C'mon, honey. What's wrong? I'm getting in. Good morning. Granny. Yes? Last night, did I come back alone? No, there was a strange two-bit thug. I see. What happened to him? He went home. He wanted some alcohol, he wanted water. Then, he threw up at the front door. A terrible mess. Very sorry about that. Professor, it's time to go to school. - Good morning! - Morning. Nice hat, professor. We need to find someplace for you to work. Where would you like to work? I can work in a factory or store. Anything is fine. No way. Forget that. You'd work all day for only ten or fifteen thousand yen. No way. Where do you guys work? Work? Work... Where do we? I wonder where. You don't have a job? Nope. Nobody would hire us. If we don't like someone, we don't keep it a secret. Two or three days, then poof! We can work her at the hotel again. Yeah, bro, but I feel sorry for her. What do you mean? She hasn't left. Sticking to us like flypaper. Your favorite flowers were slow to bloom. Kaoru, I'm sorry to be late... Fukuhara Shopping Arcade I hate... ...white clouds. Kaoru, I'm sorry to be late. Kaoru... Here's what I promised you. 3,000 yen more. Extra. That's the going rate. That's what I'll do. It's not human trafficking. Got it? Got it, you greedy granny. I've been searching for the crocus flower... Okay, Hanako, I've just talked to the old lady about you. Starting today, here... What? Why are you crying? Oh. You don't like it? You don't want to follow my idea? No, I love this song. I cry when I hear this. What a surprise. Hey, you! You got your money, so now get lost. Let's go. And you. You're my daughter from today. Think of me as your mother. Talk to me about anything. What's with the "mommy"? You're a whore. Hey, you punk. What are you talking about? I might have been a whore once. But I wasn't always one. I went to elementary school like anyone else. I worked, I got married. I had a child. So, I know how a mother feels. What? Hanako. Don't trust this old hag. She's greedy from top to bottom. What the hell are you saying? So greedy that you asked me for money, you nobody. Bounce this loser. Got it. Saburo... It's OK, let him go. Dump that punk right now or you'll have trouble. Shut up! If this fucking hag makes you do disgusting things, you can always come back. Shut your face and get out of here, you pathetic loser. I bet your mother regrets the day she had you. Gus, you there? Where the hell is he? Man, this place stinks like a pigsty. Oh, you're here. Why didn't you say anything? What happened to your face? They're here. They're here. The Tetsu gang? Where? What did they say? They said when he comes back, we'll be waiting for him by the tracks. Tell him to bring either the money or the girl. How much money? A hundred thousand. Hundred thousand? Bastards. What are you doing, wrecking our place? Who cares? This is a matter of life and death. You wouldn't know about that. It's going to be raining blood. Get pops out of here. Evacuate, for your own safety. - Evacuate? - Right. Stop eating and leave before you lose some body parts. You shouldn't be talking like that to them, bro. Says who? I'm not standing around after seeing what they did to you. What is this? Shut up. You got a problem with me, stow it until after the fight. I don't have to tell you why I'm here, do I? No. So, where is she? Not here. What? Sorry, I didn't catch that. Could you repeat yourself? Where is she? Not here. Get up. Ma'am. Thank you, sweetie. Why don't you come in and enjoy a nice hot bath? Welcome! A customer! Welcome! Oh, it's Mr. Glasses from last night. So, I was here last night. Thanks for everything. I had a paper bag with me. Did you happen to see it? With the name of a school on it. About this big. Oh, yeah. It's around here somewhere. Are you a school teacher? Sorry to trouble you. - I see. - Could I get... Never mind about that. Don't be so hard on yourself. You know what you want. Akemi's not here, but there are plenty of lovelies. That's Mari. And that's, let's see, Linda, right? And there is Yae. And then there's that beautiful girl, over there. This one, too. Isn't she adorable? What are you looking at? Oh, that girl? Yes, sir. You have a discerning eye. Ah, that girl, Meri. It's her first day. You like her? She's a good girl. Kill! Kill me! Christ, he's stubborn. Just come clean, would you? I heard from Gus that you were with the girl this morning. Now's the time to talk. Spit it out! Okay, I'll spit it out. Alright. Take a good look. I'll show you how you really settle accounts. Don't talk to me about women or money. Off with the finger. That takes care of things, right? Watch closely. It'll bleed everywhere. Don't be squeamish. - Don't do it! - Shut up. Stay out of this! Don't stop me. Don't stop me. Nobody's stopping you. Bro! Shut up. Ouch! You gonna do it? Because if you won't, I will. Put that finger forward. Not the whole hand moron, just the pinky. If you don't cut it clean, the stub will be a mess, like a piece of meat. You slice it off right at the joint. Put that finger back here. I'm going to cut it quick and clean. Got it? Ready? Here we go. Stop pulling away. Ready? You jerk, you did it again. Okay guys, hold him. All right. I'll do it. I'll do it. So, just do it already! Do it! Alright! Okay, here we go. It hurts! Hey... My finger. He swallowed it. You idiot. You finally broke the wall. You stupid shit. Who do you think you are? Shut your face! Boo hoo, Boo hoo. Crybaby. I'll beat the living daylights out of you. Hey, you! Yeah? Honey. That's enough. It's time to leave. Give him a break, would you? I'm Fudo. Member of the Shimada family. Huh? Let him have some dignity. Yes, sir. Okay. Thanks. So, everybody good? Yes, sir! You want to get this stitched up. It's going to swell up like a sausage. I know a good doctor. Follow me. OK. - Let's go. - OK. What? You were cutting a fish? Don't bullshit. This didn't happen cutting a fish. You shouldn't lie. So sorry. This is what you get for your cocky attitude. Let's see it. Can I have some painkiller? Stop joking. That's a luxury. Mistreating the body you got from your parents. Stop being such a wimp. What? For me? Sorry if this is going to hurt... Uh oh. I heard something snap. Oh. Not good. That's a bone. Alright. You hold it by the tip, and I'll cut it. Got it. Don't move. It hurts! Close the door gently. Don't touch it! I can't believe this, I don't have a finger. Look at this. Swollen like a sausage. I'm sure it's getting infected. I hurt from head to toe. What're you gonna do when I die? - Don't talk like that. - Don't touch me! I can't take this anymore. Pain from head to toe, I tell you. You want me to call Hana? Mom, I'm gonna die. Mom, I'm gonna die. - Mom! - Hey, you! Shut it! What's the problem? It's just a pinky. You can't be part of the family if you whine like that. Sorry! You keep making noise, I'll stomp on that finger. OK, I got it. That punk is yours now. He's going to latch on and never let go. I'm not getting involved. I'm not getting wrapped up with him. You are too much of a softy. That's why you're not any higher even at age forty. You only get punks like that following you. That's enough. Look at Kikuna. Only thirty-five and already at the top of the family. He drives around in a fancy car. And my husband, what kind of a provider is he? It hurts! Shut your face! Shut up or you're dead. Sorry. What? You came. Yes. I thought you wouldn't come. Sorry I'm late. Why are you crying? Because you're doing this for me, to help me. I'm sorry you had to go through this. It's okay. We owe you. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Let's cool you down some. I'm okay, I'm okay. Just stay here with me. You don't have to go back today. Right. Hanako. What's this? A good luck charm. My grandma gave it to me when I left. It's an odd looking charm. Does it work? When grandma was sick and even when she gave birth, she prayed with it. Did you pray, too? Yes, every night when I went to bed. Do you still pray? Yes. What kind of prayer? I pray that Saburo's finger will heal quickly, and that I can learn my new duties soon. Get some sleep. Over there. Alright. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. Hanako? Yes? You think you can handle things at Turkish Eden? Yes. Mother and the guests are both kind. I feel comfortable. The old hag didn't make you do hand jobs. No. What's "hand jobs"? Um, nothing. A difficult German word. Are you okay? Good night. Can you get a little closer? But if we touch, your finger is going to hurt more. Then, just kiss me. Do it gently. It won't hurt. Okay. Gentle, gentle. Hanako? Yes? Do you like me? Do you like me? Yes. Saburo. Hmm? I'm going to work really hard to earn money for your treatment. Don't worry. You are going to recover. I got a thousand yen today. What's wrong? Does it hurt? Well... I... I... I... In fact, I sold you to that place. Forgive me. It's okay. Don't cry. Night falls over the port of Kobe. The citizens return to their warm abodes, their peaceful dreams awaiting them. Ah, but who could have known that in such humble surroundings, a love so pure and beautiful would bloom and grow like lovely flowers. Hana, honey. Yes? Suck my nipple. No. Why not? Just because. Hmm. 39th Annual May Day Celebration Daddy is late. Good morning. Going on a picnic, Mr. Fudo? Great! My daughter asked me to. It's the May Day holiday. Have a great time. We'll keep an eye on things here. Hey, Dad! What's taking you? Eat some innards stew. It'll energize you. For us? You need to get serious and figure out how to support yourself. You can't live off that girl. To make it as a Yakuza, you have to have a steady way to earn. Yes, sir! Good morning. Gus, when I recover, I'm gonna get working. Why, bro? Dummy! Weren't you listening to Mr. Fudo? I can't be a Yakuza without some way to bring in cash. Those words woke me up. So, if we get some money, he'll bring us into the gang? Of course. Swell. I'll get things done. I'm not always gonna be Hanako's pimp. I've always been good with the idea of work. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna earn respect. No ass kissing for me. Know what he told me? As soon as I start earning, I'll be a member of the Shimada clan. It's a lively, lively street on May Day. Gus. Yeah? My luck is about to change. Lady luck is smiling on me. It's game on. Time to start winning. Lucky red! Here it is! You're a lucky man, brother. Akagi Obstetrics and Gynecology One two! One two! The boy Saburo points himself toward work. He's stepping up with firm resolution. But we find his lover Hanako sinking into melancholy, sitting alone in deep thought in the church yard. O Lord, here indeed is one of your poor lost sheep. Head bowed, she prays for your grace, your bountiful favor. What's the trouble? You've just been sitting there, silent. I can't help you like this. Come on, you. You have to talk to me or I can't do anything for you. Take this. Thanks. Take this, please. Hello? What? Is this a social club? It's for me. It's for me. Hello? You got a customer? Where are you guys now? We're right around the corner. There's a fire station. We're behind the building. The inn is called "Misuzu". Come on over. Yes, yes. Like the flyer says, yes. You'll get 2,000 yen. Honk two times when you are outside. Thanks! Much appreciated! Don't worry, mister. This way, please. She's an interesting girl. She's really young? Yes. Here's a customer. Boy, am I drunk! Hey, girl. You gonna take care of me? What is this? This strange woman. Don't joke around like that, honey. Joking? Excuse me, but I have to be going. - Why's that? - What do you mean? Not interested. Fine. 2000 yen cancellation fee. Cancellation fee? What a scam. Scam? Nonsense! This is no joke. It's serious business. I said "interesting woman". That tells you no ordinary prostitute. Right? Got it? I get it. What a mess. What are you doing? Hotel fee, 1000. Driver's fee, 2000. That's your total. Don't you take me for a fool. I'm getting the police. Are you kidding? Such a loser doesn't deserve this delicate creature. What the hell is this? What are you doing? - Give it here. - No way! Give it up, old man. All right, all right. Wait a second. Don't touch me. How dreadful! Hey, bro. We got it. Good job. We need to get out of here. Let's go. Huh? What's this? Sneak! We're back. - You're very chipper. - Yeah. Well, I didn't like the idea of making her work all the time. So, I found something else. What's that? The details aren't important. Here's a little gift. Thanks. Whatever it is, it's good you figured something out. Keep at it. Okay, then. Excuse me. Excuse me. You know what, you goof? You made a good whore. "Oh, come on, sweetheart. Stop kidding me". The look on that guy's face. Huh? "I waited for you about an hour. I'm going back home." "I'll see you again. Goodbye, Sabu. From Hanako." Hana was here. Guess so. Look, some sweets. Just in time. I'm starving. Make some tea. You miss her, don't you? Let's go see her. No. I'm never gonna be Hanako's pimp. And besides, it's a busy time for her. It's gotta be tough. Well, I'm stuck with you tonight. Stop it, bro. Let me go. Hey, be quiet. Kaoru-chan... I'm late... Pay attention. This is serious. I told you how already. Listen! "Would you like one?" When you say that, hold the bottle to your body like this. Got it? This is how you do it. And then show a bit of your knee. Hike it up a little, like this. Look here. Push your knee a little against his leg. Knees stuck together won't pull him in. So, keep pushing up against him. And say something like, "Can't you give me a little something?" Then, push-push against him. These men are idiots. Completely vain. They think, "Wow, this girl likes me." They'll do whatever you say after that. Got it? Don't laugh. You got it? Push your knee. Push-push. But don't push too hard or he'll fall over. Push sexy. Push-push. That's what you need to do. Try it. Try it. Welcome! Oh, it's you. What? Is Hanako here? Nope. I didn't expect her to last this long. But she made it ten days, anyway. Right? Yeah. So, only half the contract fee back is fine. Where did she go? Who cares? Hold on. Maybe that guy with glasses and the skinny face like a mantis. Said he was a school teacher. They talked on the phone, but I couldn't hear anything. That bastard. Hey, punk. What, you whore? You're in love with her, aren't you? You idiot. Who wants a country bumpkin like her? All well and good, then. Because if you liked her, I was going to have to tell you. Okay, fine. Right. All good, then. I don't need this. I'm gone. Hey! My money. I'll pay tomorrow, old fool. Tomorrow. Sure. Thanks. Don't you mean at the end of the month? You don't trust me? Greedy bitch! Shut it! You need to use your money to help her end it. End it? Abortion. She's pregnant. She's at 5 months. Something needs to be done soon or she'll blow up like a balloon. It'll be too late, then. This isn't a joking matter. Giving birth to a child that isn't wanted, is hell for parents and children alike, isn't it? Hanako is pregnant. And you’re the father? Obviously! He's such a dimwit. This kind of thing can happen, girls. You need to be careful. If you get pregnant, you can't rely on the guy. I know from experience. I had to give birth alone. That was it for me. Not again. I worked hard to get where I am. Thanks to that, here we are today. The call me Okiyo of Eden, with respect. I created this success. You need to work equally hard, like me. Right? Get as much out of each guy as you can. Hello? Hey, anybody home? Doesn't matter. Let's go. Hanako! Well, this is a delicate situation. First off, you need to talk it over calmly. Right, Saburo? I'll leave you two alone for a while. Make sure not to upset her, okay? Hanako, I heard you're pregnant. Why didn't you say anything? It's mine, isn't it? Of course it's mine, right? No, it's not yours. No? Then, whose is it? Oh! It's the skinny professor! You moron. What's wrong with you? I met this girl just a couple of weeks ago. She's 5 months on. I knew that. Get lost. So, then. A country bumpkin took advantage of you, right? You are a gullible fool, so it's easy for an asshole to do that. But you know what? I didn't like him. I hated him. I got it. Or maybe you tricked him, playing the innocent girl. I'm sorry, Saburo. I've been feeling terrible about all this. That's enough. No more regrets. But it's time to take care of business. Business? Abortion. It's easy. Five grand takes care of it. I can get that in a couple days. Let's do that, OK? No way. I don't want that. Why not? There's nothing to be scared about. Having a kid you don't want will be hell for the parents and the kid. That's not so. Not so. I can't do it. Why can't you do it? You're in love with that shithead peasant? Hmm? Am I right? Hey, you! Watch how you speak to her. You've been a pain in my ass for a long time now. I'm gonna bust your ugly face. Just calm down now. This is difficult for her. You need to talk it over properly. Listen. Hana has no choice. She isn't permitted to do it. Not allowed? Why not? You? Or what else? Just listen a minute, will you? Hana is a Catholic. Abortion isn't allowed for Catholics. What's a Catholic? Christian? That's right. What the hell? Hanako's a poor country girl from Kyushu. No way she's Christian. Right, Hanako? -Well... -Yeah? He's right. I'm Catholic. You didn't know. Christianity has been in the Kyushu countryside a long time. Oh, really? So, I'm dumb and don't know about this stuff. But I don't care. Just get rid of it. Listen. She cannot. And she is suffering for it. Your ignorance is no excuse. You have no idea how much she is suffering. She even had thoughts of suicide. But for Catholics suicide is a terrible sin. Listen! You love Hana, don't you? So, you must think things over calmly. Hana loves you. But she must carry the child of someone she doesn't love. And she absolutely cannot get an abortion. Only death could be a resolution, but it's out of the question. This problem is very difficult to solve. I can't follow this. Makes my head hurt. Come on, man. Apply yourself. Think it through rationally. Whatever. It's all good. I'm taking Hanako. Let's go to the hospital. I told you, you can't. What the hell? You shut up and listen now. You're just making shit up. You want to take Hanako from me. You want her for your wife. Hanako, are you part of this plan? Moron! Shut up! Sabu! Bitch! Go home. Hana is in misery because you are such a jerk. No matter what, I'll protect Hana from a lousy lowlife like you. Get out! I'm leaving! Alas, the joy of love is gone. There's no song, no dance. All that remains is the anger of the betrayed, the grief of the deceiver. What's going on, bro? I did it! I did it! I did it! Sorry I'm late. Stupid shit! Kaoru... late... Hey, asshole! Watch where you're going. What kind of punk are you? Yeah? What kind of punk are you? I'll kick your ass. C'mere. Show your face. We're from the Shinko family. You know what that means? I'm Sabu from the Shimada family. Sabu? Never heard of him. Shimada Fudo is my boss. Sorry. Get out of here. Go home and sleep it off, assholes. I'm going to get you. What the hell? Stop it, you little shit. Not like that, bro! Bro! Sabu from Shimada's doing this! You idiot! It hurts! Where did he get you? My butt. He stabbed my butt. What do we do now, bro? Turn myself in. To the cops? Got to. Someone died. I've killed him. What are you looking at? It's not some game. Knock it off! Gus, go to Hanako for me. Tell her I turned myself in. Tell her I went with manly dignity. Tell her to forget about me and live her own life happily. I can't let go! I can't let go of it! Hey, Fudo! You there? Hey! You know any "Sabu"? Sabu? Yeah, I've got him. That moron. He used our name when stabbing a junior Shinko member. What? Stabbed him? What's going on here? Old man Yamatatsu called our boss. He's really pissed off. You need to see him now. Honey! You really fucked up this time. Better be ready to lose a finger. Right. You have one? Take this with you. You're a total fuck up. Sabu... They have been separated for several nights. How many tears of longing were left on their respective pillows? "Oh, Hana!" He called out to her in his sleep, only to wake on a hard bed in a lonely jail cell. For how many nights? Say, you two, visiting time is only three minutes. You need to hurry up and say whatever you need to say. Yes, sir. Say, Sabu. Do you have enough underwear? I had to throw them away because they got dirty. I'm not wearing any right now. Really? Don't you have more important things than that to talk about? Well... My lawyer said the wound was minor and I'm a first-time offender, so if I'm repentant at the trial, I'll get a suspended sentence or charges will be dismissed. There's nothing to worry about. Really? Times up. Let's go. Say, when I get out of here, I want you to live with me. Come on. Get moving. And don't do anything with that dirty old man! Time to go! Sabu... Why didn't you stop her going to the jail? Huh? You didn't understand what I said? You said you would look out for her if anything happened. Stupid old lady. She can't be happy with Saburo around. So you say, but she loves him. It doesn't matter. They might be suffering separately right now, but it's for the best in the end. It's best for her. What the hell do you know, anyway? Now I'm going to be late, thanks to you. When I get out of here, I want you to live with me. And don't do anything with that dirty old man! Night after night, you can't imagine how much she is suffering. Poor Hanako. She has nowhere to go. Alone in misery, wandering the night streets, with no refuge in the depths of sorrow, a sorrow that can't be healed. Whom should she curse? At whom should she be angry? Should she cry her eyes out? Hanako, go ahead and cry. Cry! Cry for the misfortune that came to you unbidden. Huh? What's that? What's happened? Are you all right? Are you okay? Everything okay? Come on, get in the car. Oh, no! What? Blood! Huh? What should we do? We need a hospital right away. Thank you. So, you came. Yes. By yourself? Yes. In this situation you are supposed to say, "You did great handling such difficulty." You did great handling such difficulty. Well, it was only ten days. It's great to be out. Say... What? You didn't hear anything inside? Like what? Oh. You mean that the warden told me I should go thank that skinny professor. That old bastard is an odd bird. I didn't ask for a thing, but he put in a word for me. He got me out on bail. Makes me want to vomit thinking about it. Right? Yeah. I was ready for a couple of years behind bars, you know? Right? Kaoru dear, sorry to be late... Gus, why isn't she here? I mean, seriously... Hey! Hey! What's with the long face? Sabu. Hana... Yeah? She died. You're out now. We heard you'd be out today, so we postponed the funeral one day. They embalmed her, so her body would keep. She still looks good. Go ahead and take a look. Hurry. She didn't go to the professors's house. She was wandering around and then miscarried. She got blood poisoning as a result. You look so pretty, you poor thing. See? Take a look. The professor reported her as missing. That let them identify her when she was found. Otherwise, she would have been just another Jane Doe. Pray for her. She'll be cremated tomorrow. Saburo. Forgive me, I've done wrong. What are you talking about? It's like you're reading a script. Don't talk nonsense. I feel bad for Saburo from the bottom of my heart. If I had done a better job, it wouldn't have come to this. I should never have gotten involved with her life. It's too late for such regrets. What's done is done. But if I'm honest about things, I got in the way of their relationship. If I had correctly understood Hana's feelings... No one could know her feelings. I think you had a crush on her, so you don't know what you're saying. I prepared her to lie here. Such a beautiful body. Not a scar or a blemish. Hanako! Hanako! Hanako! Hanako! You fool! You fool! Following the address on an unsent postcard, he sets off for her grandmother's house, clutching her ashes to be returned to her hometown. The postcard contained these words: How are you, Grandma? Since you gave me the statuette of the Virgin Mary, I've been so happy. Kobe is a big city. I often feel scared, but with the Virgin Mary I will be fine. [Latin Mass] Caged bird, caged bird. When will you come out? At the crack of dawn, the crane and tortoise slipped. Who is that at my back? Now welcomed into heaven, her origins were in poverty on this island. Having been deceived by one man, she could find love with another. Back in her hometown, she will rest here forever. Ah, the maiden saved, rescued from this world. Our heartfelt wish is for the salvation of her eternal soul. We have to ask God. Was her poverty a sin? Was it a sin for her to be so kind-hearted? Sorry to bother you. I've many things to do, you know. Sorry, but we really need to hurry. That was too much. My chest is ready to explode. Where the hell is he? Running away from his debts, no doubt. Bro! Where were you? Taking a crap. My last one in Japan. Did you wipe your ass? What's that stink? Where are you headed to? Taiwan, Singapore, all around. Another one that Japan has had enough of. Punks like you give Japan a bad name abroad. What the hell are you talking about? Alright, I'm off. Hey, punk! What? Didn't you want to tell me something? Nah, nothing I can remember. Really? Pretending to forget? I came all the way here to see you off, so say your piece. Bro, you need to speak up. The ship is leaving. What? You want me to forgive your debts? That's not going to happen. Hurry up. Spit it out. Alright, I'm just going to say it. You're my mom, aren't you? Huh? What's that? 20 years ago in Kyoto. You were working in a whorehouse and gave birth, right? Where did you hear such a thing? Was that me? That baby died right after birth. This is what you've been thinking about? You're a riot. Well, I was thinking that. I see I was wrong. I just wanted to make sure. If that was the case, it would be like a stage play. But it wasn't. You need to go. Gus, you take care. Hey, punk! What, whore? Come here, come here. When you get wherever you are going, keep this in mind. Watch out for the clap. It'll rot your thing. It's scary. Here, take this. What's this? Rubbers. Use them. Some kind of goodbye gift that is. Bro... Goodbye. Great Sun, Great Sun, stand by. Bro, take care of yourself. Good luck to you! Be careful out there. Gus, you take good care of the old lady. She'll probably keel over from a stroke, anyway. Keep it to yourself, loser! Good thing you are leaving, you idiot. Bro... Bro. Goodbye! The young man is leaving, filled with new hope, not knowing when or if he will return. Goodbye to country, goodbye to friends. Travel far and wide, young man. Be brave, be strong. You'll find kindred spirits on your way. Farewell, young man, farewell. The End
