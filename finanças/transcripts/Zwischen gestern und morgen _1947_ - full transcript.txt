BETWEEN YESTERDAY AND TOMORROW A FILM BY HARALD BRAUN AND HERBERT WITT BASED ON AN IDEA BY JACOB GEIS PRODUCED IN GEISELGASTEIG STUDIOS, MUNICH UNDER LICENSE OF THE INFORMATION CONTROL DIVISION OF THE AMERICAN MILITARY GOVERNMENT FOR GERMANY STARRING: ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS IN THIS FILM ARE FICTITIOUS. ANY RESEMBLANCE TO PEOPLE, LIVING OR DEAD, IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL DIRECTED BY: HARALD BRAUN TO MUNICH VIA KARLSRUHE FROM BASEL (SWITZERLAND) Violets! Fresh violets. Would you like to take a bunch, sir? This one? Or this? 1.20, please. Yes, that's a lovely one. Is it for your fiancée? Maybe. Is it gripping properly now? What?! I can't hear. More that way! No! That's too far! Stop! And now step on the gas! Hello, Miss! - Yes, what? - Is there somewhere to stay? - What? You'll have to speak up! - Is this the way to the hotel? Are you a guest? Where are you from? From abroad? Anything to trade? - What? - Do you have anything to trade?! No. But may I offer you a cigarette? Great. I won't say no. Hotel's that way, along the planks. - Front entrance is now at the back. - Thanks. It's slipping... Thank you. - How can I help you, sir? - Mr. Hummel. Oh, it's Mister... now what was the name...? It's on the tip of my tongue... Don't tell me... It's Mr. Rott! I'm pleased to see you here again. An old regular... Well, what do you think of our-- We'll get there. We already have 20 rooms to let. Well, cubicles rather than rooms. We're putting the guests in the pool, but not in the water. Mr. Rott. My goodness, where shall I put you...? The boss will also be very... - Mr. Ebeling? - Yes, he will most certainly... Yes... Many thanks for your visit. It has given me great... Good evening. Mr. Hummel, what on earth is it? Where am I staying, then? - You want to stay? - Yes. We're fully booked. I'm fully... full. - And upstairs? - That's quite impossible, Mr. Rott. But maybe at the station...? You can stay one or two nights-- I'm staying here. Upstairs. Follow me. You will see, no one can... You can't either, Mr. Rott! What are you doing there? - It's the fire escape. - Yes. 220. That's where I stayed back then. The last time, in March, 1938. What more could you ask for? The walls are still standing. Mr. Ebeling! Excuse me a moment. - Sorry to disturb you. Mr. Rott is here! - Who? The illustrator, you remember, back then he-- - Michael Rott? Where? - Here, in the hotel. We know each other. Michael Rott. I remember. Good evening. Please tell me... What became of Miss Rodenwald? The student... who worked in your newspaper kiosk. You see... it's very important to me. I... knew... Miss Rodenwald well. Actually... it's because of her I've come back. Sorry we don't have a suitable room. The room's good enough for me. I'm sure I can find a room for you in another hotel. Why? I'm staying here. As you wish. Hey, Miss. What are you doing there? Come on out. My darling, I've been watching you for quite some time now. You're always hanging around here. I've told you many times: You have no business here at our hotel. What are you doing here? I... - I want to visit a guest. - Oh, who's that? Him. - Mr. Rott, sir, uses the fire escape? - Yes, my friend. Sometimes... I do. But-- - The gentleman's staying here. - Yes, but... You see? Do you know the young lady? - Yes, we know each other. - Oh, well... Then I most sincerely... Good evening. That was kind of you. - Mr. Hummel would certainly have me... - Yes, certainly. So, thank you. You're welcome. By the way, my name is Kat. Short for Katharina. - Are you here on business? - No. I'm an illustrator. An artist! Are you famous? - I'm sure you are. - Why? - You look like it. - Famous? No, you don't look famous. I mean... I think you do! Thank you. I worked down there. - In the hole? - Yes. I mean, before. The bar was there. Yes... The bar was there. Have you ever been there? Yes. Wasn't it wonderful? Yes. It was wonderful. - Are you mad?! Making all that noise! - Got it yet? Tomorrow. Tomorrow for sure. - The digger will finish tomorrow. - So you still don't have it! Damn it. Freddy. Don't mess with me! I can't keep the guys waiting. A wallet this thick. Think they'll wait? Once I'll get it out of there, they'll be eating out of our hands! You reckon? I'm meeting them tomorrow at the station. - If I don't have... - Freddy. - Five candy? - For one? - Two chewing gum. - Three. Deal. Wait. Take me part of the way. Tomorrow. Excuse me... How long have you been at the hotel? A year. And before that, ten years ago, did you work here? No. Were you a guest here back then? A lot has changed. - Do you require anything else, sir? - Yes... I was here back then. Yes. Back then. Bit cold, isn't it? Wakes you up, though! I drove all through the night. Hello, attendant! Attendant, hello! What a mess. Mr. Pfeiffer! - No one here. Can I help you? - No, thank you. My nose, if you could... I can't take my hands out. The handkerchief is under my chin. With pleasure. I'm a famous nose-blower. - Do you prefer a firm grip or... - Just go ahead. Of course. Right. And now blow hard. Well done. And again. See. Had a bit to drink yesterday evening? Yes, you did, chubby chops. Right. Keep up the good work. My respects. Hello, Micky! - Thank God you're here. - Morning. Did I need to bring my life's work? As they're sending a bigwig from Berlin... - What would you do? - What's the chap's name? Trunk. Ministerial Director. A rather unpleasant character. - Best if I talk to him. - Sure. As your publisher. I know that bunch. - I'd like to chuck it all in. - I thought you're a humorist. Do you think you can create... a caricature from these caricatures? It's a complete farce. Speak any louder, and they'll come and take you away. Here he is. - New blood, my man. - Of course, Ministerial Director. Is that him? I need young faces. Manly, healthy, pure. In a word – German. Ministerial Director, may I introduce one of our artists, Michael Rott. Ministerial Director Trunk. Oh... you? - You gentlemen have met? - In passing. Yes. I had the honor of wiping the Ministerial Director's nose. - With some success. - And a firm grip, as you acknowledged. - I'd like to speak to you first. - Perhaps there, Ministerial Director? May I? Professor! My respects. Do take a seat. Are you bunking off lectures? How wise! If I could at least have a nice little beer instead, but no! They've sent some chap from Berlin again, regarding new directives. The only thing that bodes well about this man is his name. - He's called Trunk. - Then, cheers, Professor! I also have to partake of this "drink". He's over there. Next to my friend Weber. The one with the glasses. Do you see him? Unfortunately not. Not up to it any more. Watch this. So... This is what he looks like. Roughly, of course. The lad has... what's called... an expressive face. There we are. And he's sweating. Look... how he's sweating. You know why? Because he's... feeling the heat from above. For goodness sake, Rott. What is it? It doesn't mean... - I think he's softened up. - Coming. - Good morning, Professor. - Excuse me please, Professor. I'll keep it short, Mr. Rott. Following your publisher's assurances, I'm prepared to overlook certain concerns. For now. After all, we politicians have retained our sense of humor. It is in the interest of our government to accord a place to wholesome amusement. He who laughs, grumbles not. Isn't that so? Humor is when you laugh despite it all. I won't deny that your attitude has often caused grave concern. I deeply regret that. Well... All right. Since Mr. Weber has assured us your future work will follow the Reich Minister's directives... Has he? - Excuse me, Deputy Director... - Ministerial Director. Ministerial Director... So you don't think that the artist should be given a little more creative freedom? No. Absolutely not, Mr. Rott. Stop! Mr. Privy Councilor! You nearly passed your good fortune, Ms. Rodenwald. I'm so sorry. - I didn't see you. - Who said anything about me? I got to say, Mr. Rott... you're not exactly making it easy for me. Ministerial Director, please do take into account that an artist thinks and - feels differently to a politician. - Please excuse me a moment. The most recent cartoons will certainly put an end to your concerns. Thank God for that. They're all still there. One, two, three. That's a weight off my mind. Plop. Heard it? - What are you talking about? - The freckles on your nose! I was so worried they might have disappeared. - Is that so important? - Hugely important to me. Very nice. If you'd like to look at our most recent sheets. Delightful. Where is our artist? Just a moment, Ministerial Director. - Here he is, Ministerial Director. - Yes. That was most... interesting. Thank you, gentlemen. I must cut short our discussion. May I assume, Ministerial Director? Yes, well, I think... we'll speak again. May I accompany you? My respects, Professor. What are you doing in this den of vice? This man from the Ministry had to rush off. - I'm to wait for him here. - Let's wait together. - What are you drinking? Water? - I can't confront this man with the... slurring my words. Why not? Wholesome enjoyment of life's pleasures is quite encouraged! - Mr. Hugo, two Manhattans, if I may. - Two Manhattans? Certainly, Mr. Rott. Come and join us afterwards. There are just the two of us. Have you given Annette some thought? Of course not. I've known her for four semesters. You're a steadfast, decent man. And particularly... here... revered artist. Annette is too good for this here. For an affair. - You're an art historian, aren't you? - Yes. You're not involved in psychology, the inner life of our fellow beings? I'm relieved to hear it. But... as far as Annette's concerned, you're absolutely right. It's now 10 o'clock. I'm going to get her. I love that girl. Here. Attention please. As the gong strikes, it will be 10 o'clock. - We'll kick off with our dance music. - Coming. - I will just pretty myself up a little. - Of course. Hello, Rott. - Look, it's Corty! - Corty? - Fabulous. - Just like on stage. And his voice! This is my friend, Michael Rott. The most wicked cartoonist around, but a nice chap nonetheless. Who's the lady? - Good evening, Mr. Rott. - Good evening, Madam. See you later. In the bar. - May I? - Well? Well. - Goes without saying. - Here. Here! I didn't want to drink anything this evening. Michael, you're my witness, I held fast like a man. But... we have good reason to. Don't we, Michael? What are you two doing? Life, dear little Annette... is a damn hard work. It beats us up, so we lose our sight and hearing. But... those who have the good fortune to be happy—like you—are not hurt by it. They don't feel the punches, but caresses instead. You have to... outwit life! That's what I'm drinking to now, and in good measure. It's like a real celebration today, isn't it? Music, a speech, wine. - Only that... - Flowers, right. Unfortunately, I've... - Given them away. - Yes. What a cruelty of mine, wasn't it? But we'll make amends now. Mr. Hummel. A menu, if I may. - The menu. - Thank you. - Would Mr. Rott like a wine? - No, Mr. Rott would like this menu. The menu, of course. Do you have a pencil too? - Here. Use mine. - Thanks. - Why do you need it? - You wanted flowers, didn't you? Look. You little botanist. Good, isn't it? Professor. Outwit it... A BOUQUET THAT WILL NEVER FADE Never? Never. Ministerial Director Trunk. Ministerial Director Trunk is here. - Shall I have someone look for him? - No, thank you. We'll wait. Annette... Good night. - Do you know The Magic Mountain? - What? The novel. Volume 1, last line. - No, what does it say? - Don't forget... to return my pencil. Mr. Rott. You were so kind to me. I'd like to ask something of you. Till tomorrow. Yes... Who? Weber! What is it? No, I wasn't here. No, just at that very moment... - You're mad. - I'm telling you... The arrest warrant was signed a few hours ago. - They'll be there shortly. - How do you know? I just know. Trunk has a drawing of yours considered a threat to state security. - Where are you? - The phone box opposite. You must leave now. Don't go home! It's madness. It's quite impossible for me to vanish just now. Wait, I'm coming over to you. - Is it much further? - Just here, sir. - Which room number? - 220, sir. We don't want a scene. Back then. - Good night. - Good night. I saw some shoes today. Quite a sole, and double stitched. - Boys' shoes? - No, men's shoes. You've promised me shoes for so long. And you'll get some. - Maybe tomorrow... Sure, Hansi. - With leather soles. And a couch. One for you, one for me. And we'll get a carpet too. And slacks with a back pocket and a zip, and a massive chocolate pudding with vanilla sauce. - A huge jug of it and... and... - And don't forget your ears. - I'm coming to check them. - You can. - What if it goes wrong? - How so? - What if they take it away? - Who? It's nobody's business. Everyone's up to something. - But... - Head up, arms down. - If I don't take it, someone else will. - Does it belong to you? Whatever's in the rubble doesn't belong to anyone. It's as much mine as anyone's. Right arm. Off you go. It's everyone for himself now. No one gives you anything for free. Violets? Super. UNIVERSITY LIBRARY Mr. Privy Councilor. You have a visitor. Good morning, Professor. Don't you remember me? Michael Rott. Rott. Yes, I remember. You look very well indeed. You seem to have fared well during these years. Congratulations. Yes... I went away. We stayed here. It must have been terrible. - I know... - What? What do you know? Unless you were here... you know nothing. - Are you not well? - Well? I'm very well indeed. I now only deal with books, as you can see. It's better to live with books... than with people. You can't say that, professor. You, of all people. How are the young to cope with life without the help of someone like you? You think that? For 30 years, I taught young people about the beauty of art, the clear and pure law of creativity. Inner freedom, true humanity. And how did that help them cope? Come with me. The doctoral works of my favorites, of the best. Erich Horn, fell in action in Africa. Fritz von Puttkammer, missing in Russia. Cornelia Hirsch, beaten to death, or gassed or some such. Gunther Fink, committed suicide. Klaus Werner Balk, in Dachau or another camp. Hanged! Fallen! Blind! Fallen! Arrested! Hanged! I'm well. Very well indeed! No, Rott. No more people. Books. The great minds! They don't disappoint. They don't lie. And they don't make fools of us. I'm looking for Annette. Annette Rodenwald. - Do you know anything about her? - Annette? Yes, indeed. Do you know anything? Get out. Go on, get out! Get out! Lovely, isn't it? - Sorry? - It's lovely here. If you close your eyes. Got nothing to do with it being in ruins. - With what, then? - With enjoying what you can. - And what would that be? - For example, lazing in the sun. - Like lazing around, too? - I suppose. See. You should get some fresh air! Walk for a few hours. You must have a friend, or a nice acquaintance. Give it a go! You think so? - Yes. Right, then. - What? - Or are you otherwise engaged? - Me? No. Of course not. - Let's go, then. - Yes! Heavens, I can't. - So you are otherwise engaged. - Yes. I mean, no. It's just business, of course. It's awfully urgent. But I'll be quick. Half an hour. Will you wait? I'll come and get you! And thank you very much! Annette! Annette! Is it really you? I can't believe... you're really still here! - Where do you live now? - Here. In the hotel? Please. - I can't believe that no one told me. - What? That you live here. I'm staying here, too. Upstairs. In my old room. Do you? - Won't you take off your coat? - Yes. Thank you. I saw Professor von Walther earlier. I barely recognized him. - Please sit down. - Thanks. We spoke about you, of course. He was there with us... that evening. In the bar. I've forgotten that. I haven't forgotten it. "Don't forget to return my pencil." Goodness, Annette, what has happened? Happened? When I fell asleep that night back then... I loved you, Michael. I loved you so much. But it was already over. Heavens, on what grounds do you think I left? I don't know. I don't want to know. But I wrote to explain. - No. - The very same day. - And then later on, from Switzerland. - I didn't receive a single line. That's impossible. Don't you believe me? I don't know. Annette. Mr. Ebeling. Why didn't you say that Miss Rodenwald--? Annette is my wife. I wanted to spare you this reunion. I should have told you he was here, but... I didn't want to upset you. You return after ten years... Ten locked out, dead years... and everywhere you go are barriers. You speak, but no one answers. You extend your hand, but into thin air. Does that surprise you? No. It doesn't surprise me. You shut your doors with great care, Mr. Ebeling. As if a hiding place. - However, I had nothing to hide. - Meaning? - That it was quite easy for you! - You know why I left. - On political grounds, was it?! - You doubt that?! I understand that your memory fails you in this matter. Not unusual in such cases. Well... Let's leave it at that. - I must ask you to leave-- - No, no, Mr. Ebeling. I won't do that. I'm staying here until... you've told me everything. Do you still remember the day you left the hotel so suddenly? It was 22 March 1938. - But you don't remember Mrs. Dreyfuss. - Dreyfuss? - Nelly Dreyfuss. - Yes. Of course. And? - So you do. - Meaning? All right. It all started when Nelly Dreyfuss... the day before—one day before your departure, Mr. Rott— came back to the hotel. I will never forget that evening. I was at reception, checking the bills, when the porter gave me two telegrams. One was from you, Mr. Rott. The other one from Berlin, from Ministerial Director Trunk. Both gentlemen announced their arrival the next day. Mr. Rott. He can have room 220 again. It was vacated this morning. Trunk is back again. What can we do? 101 and 102. Strange, whenever this man is here, I feel uneasy. He's a pleb, Mr. Ebeling. A Jew gobbler and a pleb. - Mr. Hähnle! - But that's how it is. Good evening, Mr. Ebeling. May I have a room? A good one with a bathroom. Just for one day. I'll leave the day after tomorrow. Forgive me, Madam, but are you aware that it's now stipulated... - Oh, are you full? - No. Of course you can stay, but... Here? I've forgotten how it's done. Just your name. I'll do the rest. Bellboy. I haven't been here for three years. How nice that you still recognize me. Thank you for that. Oh, nonsense, Mr. Corty! Hello? Mr. Corty. Mr. Ebeling. - It's not possible. - She's only staying for one day. - Didn't she say anything else? - No. Madam appears to be very brave— or, rather, desperate. That's sometimes one and the same thing. - Corty. - I'll be right back. Yes. Nelly. Sasha! Good evening, Sasha. - That's kind of you. - Nelly. Let me look at you. You look well. A bit tired. Spending time in bars? Drinking lots of Martinis? Do you realize what you're doing? Staying at the Palace Hotel, in a magnificent room. I can bathe as often as I want. I can even see the famous actor, Alexander Corty... - whom I knew well. - And quickly disowned. Darling, in front of everyone. The situation really is a bit tricky. Especially when you're a famous actor, and dependent on publicity. I've often worried about this... divorce. We had no other choice. And I wanted it, too. - For my sake. - Your sake? You couldn't have carried on acting. And an Alexander Corty who isn't acting... You'd have been a shadow of yourself. And... being married to a shadow... Do you think that's such... a pleasure? No. - Are you well? - Yes. Mama lives with me now. We live in a tiny mountain village. No one knows we're-- I mean, no one knows us. And we have to pump our own water. But that's good fun, too. The way you talk about it... - I could almost believe you. - You can believe me. You know, I always have good fortune. Now tell me about you. Theater? Film? New plans? Yes. A new project has turned up. With all the filming, these last few years I haven't worked in the theater. But I'm signing a contract tomorrow. Two or three roles I've always wanted. How wonderful, Sasha. Wonderful. And what about the ladies? - Awestruck enough? - Come now, Nelly. Oh, now that coming from such a famous man! The blonde at the lift looked delightful. - A colleague? - No, she's from Rosenheim. Her husband has a corset factory. Such things still exist? Is she waiting for you? - Yes, but... - No, you must go right away. I'll still be here tomorrow. You haven't changed one bit. Goodbye. Mr. Ebeling, please. Maybe an artist's biography. A great man, handsome and passionate, who loves and lives life to the full. I need that before I go to sleep. That's the right thing. I'll take that. - What does Jealousy cost? - 6.80. Do you get jealous, too? Jealousy is the best thing in love. Seriously. - "The most beautiful lady is jealousy." - Good evening. Good evening, Miss. At last. I'd like to ask you, Mr. Ebeling, to put my jewellery in your safe. I didn't want to leave it at home. I feel it's safer here. What you're doing isn't without its dangers, Madam. Can you imagine what it's like? Married to Alexander Corty for five years... a man I... love very much. Five years of happiness and wealth and life and friends, and now only loneliness and... fear. And having to hide. Can you imagine what it's like living... in the most basic mountain hut? With a mother you love, and whose life... you want to make easy and joyful. I simply couldn't stand it any longer. Or I would have... gone mad. But maybe I'll be lucky. This day may end like any other. It's possible, isn't it? But even if something does happen... I had to relive my life for a bit. I had to be surrounded by light and-- Maybe it sounds silly... I had to wear my dresses. I had to feel carpets under my feet. And... see my husband. Is Mr. Corty aware of the situation? No. Of course not. And don't tell him, please. It's kind of you to come here in person, director, but... - what do you mean by that? - My God, I'm not allowed to. - I've been forbidden to. - You don't think I can play the role?! Not at all. You're a bit slow on the uptake. Haven't you heard of the population policy? - I thought we were involved in art. - Did you? What era are you living in? Our Minister believes that German women's erotic dreams must look different! Joyful, cheerful and dim! So what's to do? - That's idiotic. - Careful. Have you contested this decision? Contested it? Me? I'll be damned. I'm not mad. Well, I'm very sorry, my dear Corty. Of course, if you want to play fathers, solid older men, I'd be delighted. Naturally, it's not the same pay. Do you want to? I knew it. So, a triple joyful Sieg Heil! If you want my advice... Trunk is here at the moment. He's a big gun. Have a go with him. Be a bit dynamic, a bit reverential. It's an opportunity, suck up to him a bit. Thank you! Now just a moment. Who do you think you are?! I think to be an artist. I have to act out what my being needs to express. We have a responsibility. We want to give the best we have! Whoever doesn't do that— whoever lets himself be used—, either goes to hell, or becomes a puppet, like you! I take it you are prepared to repeat that in front of witnesses. Good morning. Excuse me, I didn't know... I'm the theater director, Kesser. What's wrong with him? - My dear lady-- - Nonsense! They can't just ruin someone... who is well-known in the theater, whether due to chance or ability or the public's imagination. They can't just ruin him, destroy his inner and outer being! My God, Sasha. You know what sort of people they are. When a drunk comes towards you, forcing you off the pavement onto the road.... you don't feel inwardly destroyed by that. You're still the same person. You're so wonderfully sure of who you are, Nelly. There are people nothing can happen to because they're so far above it. But I... you see... I'm not one of those people. I haven't felt good... since you left. I need people who think something of me. Because I-- You may find this rather feeble... because otherwise I don't think anything of myself. Sasha. No... it's not easy just looking at yourself. You notice only too easily how your hair is getting ever grayer. But you're actually... never alone. No, actually I'm not. But since you left – constantly. Could you pass me my purse, please? It's on the chair. I have to blow my nose. I'm behaving so stupidly. Probably because we haven't seen each other for so long. I'm so very glad you're here. It was a wonderful idea of yours. Perfect timing. I don't know how I'd have dealt with this otherwise. Know what? We'll spend the whole day in your room. We'll have something sent up for luncheon. Would you like that? And we'll go out this evening. To the bar. But not before ten o'clock. And we'll dance too. Thank God. - Why? - I've got my evening dress. Hello, Rott. This is my friend, Michael Rott, the most wicked cartoonist around, but otherwise a nice chap. - Mr. Rott. - Madam. I had heard you were here. Our rooms are next door. I'm the man in 220. - A warm welcome. - Thank you, Mr. Rott. How nicely you said that. Today is a good day for me. I'm truly happy today. What do you make of Mr. Rott? He's nice, but a bit happy-go-lucky. - Well? - Well. Goes without saying. Here. Here! I'm so sorry, Madam. - That's all I need. - Sorry? He was saying hello to you. Oh, no. Thank you. I'm sure he meant you. Nonsense! She wouldn't have let him. - Who was that? - Who? - The man at the bar. - Don't look. The man who's banned me. Shall we stop dancing? Please. Jealous, little lady? Of her? Corty has always had... for this type. Apparently his wife was... - non-Aryan. - Oh. That is his wife. A light, please. Is that allowed? Hardly. - To you, Sasha! - To you too, Nelly! Yes. Me too. Oh, Nelly. No, it's fine. It's passed. Come on, tell me. What will you do? Travel? Fall in love? Spoil yourself? I don't know. I really don't know. - Why not? - It doesn't really matter. What do you mean? Obviously, this stupid ban means that suddenly everything is very uncertain, isn't it? You know me. I've never really been good with money or saving. Sasha, would you do me a favour? I'm leaving tomorrow. We barely need anything. We live on very little. Mama and I can't spend money, even if we wanted to. Take my jewellery. The ruby one. I've got it here. In Ebeling's safe. You'll get a lot for it. I don't need it. I'd like you to have it. It's very kind of you. But... I wouldn't dream of it. It's all you have left. Let's speak no more of it. But, Sasha... - Good night. - Good night. Excuse me. Mr. Rott. Mr. Rott, you were so kind to me. I'd like to ask something of you. - It's urgent. - Yes. With pleasure. Mr. Ebeling. Mr. Ebeling, would you give me my jewellery from the safe? Of course. It's a sort of surprise, Mr. Rott. I'd like to leave my jewellery here for... Alexander Corty. Perhaps you could help me. He won't take it from me, he thinks I need it. But I don't. Thank you very much. Please, give this to Mr. Corty tomorrow morning when I'm gone, I'm leaving at 5. You understand, Mr. Ebeling? Sasha is so sensitive, and... you, Mr. Rott, as a friend of his... - Thank you very much. - You're most welcome. - I wish you well. - Thank you. Most sincerely. I'm leaving feeling very happy. - I'll give Mama your best wishes? - Yes. My God, I'll have so much to tell her. It'll be all right now for a while. Adieu. Don't go, Nelly. I need you so. Can't you tell how much I need you? You've often thought that, haven't you? We belong together, Nelly. Darling, it's not possible. We know it's not possible. You mustn't be afraid, not for me or for yourself. Tomorrow it will all seem different. For sure. We're both still alive. We think of each other. Life is so beautiful. In spite of everything. So beautiful. So, little lady... - Good night. - Good night. - Night, Bartender. - Good night, Ministerial Director. Who was that? Oh, no! Yes. Sasha. I have to tell you something. It's easier on the phone. And I'm absolutely serious. I... I love you, Nelly. That's the only thing I know for sure. I'm packing my suitcase and we'll leave together tomorrow. Sasha. Sasha! Mr. Corty's room, please. Tolerance? Tolerance is a sign of weakness. But, sir, you don't need to... No, no, absolutely not. - Of course, sir. - Well, then... We can't be led a merry dance, although I have nothing against dancing in general. - Where now? - Along here. Mr. Rott? Mr. Rott. - Let's see. - Yes. Not here. What are you doing here? Goodness me! The lady doesn't seem to be too fussy. No wonder. I think you should take a closer look at the woman. Who are you? I'm Nelly Dreyfuss. Dreyfuss. So you are...? Yes. I'm Jewish. I thought you'd long since forgotten that. No. The woman checked in at this hotel yesterday. Did you know who this woman was, Mr. Ebeling? - Yes. - Interesting... We will have to speak with you further about that. Mr. Corty. Miss Dreyfuss was married to you until two years ago? - Yes. - Make a note of that. You met her yesterday evening at the hotel? - I did indeed, but-- - I see – by chance. Remarkable. And you spent all day and all evening here with her. Did you still have... an intimate relationship with her? You called for me? Shut the door. Know what it's about? No. You were with Mr. Rott yesterday evening? Yes. For how long? - Until... - I saw Miss Rodenwald say goodnight to Mr. Rott by the lift. Shortly after half past twelve. Did Mr. Rott say where he's gone? - No. - Yesterday evening, we found Miss Dreyfuss... in Mr. Rott's room. Did he mention this rendez-vous to you? No. - Mr. Rott will be able to explain-- - Mr. Rott can't be found. He left the hotel this evening. What? It would be very important for us to learn... what caused Miss Dreyfuss... Yes, but... Why don't you ask her? Miss Dreyfuss is dead. You may go, Mr. Corty. That was March 22, 1938. We married two years later. And I will always be grateful to life... for entrusting Annette to me. Yes. That's one possible scenario. What? There's no denying it. Miss Dreyfuss was betrayed... by someone who knew where she was. And for whom it was vital that she disappeared. Because I had her jewellery in my pocket? You have a wonderful imagination, Mr. Ebeling. But I can reassure you... that back then I passed the stuff on to Mr. Corty. I knocked on his door, but he didn't open it. I could wait no longer – the officers might appear at any second. So I put the jewellery... through the letterbox in his door. - In the letterbox of all places? - He must have found it there... - I assume. - And I assume... you know Alexander Corty is dead. No. Do you really think I...? Let it be, Mr. Rott. Times are so demanding that Annette and I need all our strength to cope with things to some extent. It's not up to me to pronounce a judgment. - But what's past... must be over. - But it isn't over. Betraying someone, robbing someone else, having their death on one's conscience. You've accused me of that for ten years, and still do! Yes. Who is it? - Me. Shall we go? - What is it? - What? - To get some fresh air. You're packing? Are you leaving? You've only just got here. Yes, I wanted to leave. But now I can't. I first have to... I wasn't long, was I? It'll be done by this evening. - What? - My deal. You... You'd do me a favour if you could just be quiet for a moment. Does it have to do with a woman? Whom you love? Do you think he's changed? Why did he really come back? Do you understand that? Maybe we were wrong about him. I can't believe he would lie. He said he'd written to me. Maybe his letters got lost. Good night. Good night. He did write to you. I destroyed the letters back then. I considered it my duty. I couldn't allow you to be upset and troubled again! It was only out of concern for you. I know you may not be able to forgive me. I won't ask you to. But as he stood there today... I simply owe it to him. And to you. Cosy, isn't it? How extraordinary. You live for years and years somewhere out there... You're comfortable, you're working, you sometimes laugh... But, deep down... you're getting poorer. You reminisce. You long... not just for people, but for the country, the air, and... Well... And then you think... when you return as a friend to a country that has lost most of its friends, that you should be welcome. And? And what did the stranger from Switzerland find? That the door... is slammed in his face. Yes. Well. But it's nice here at your place, sitting by your little stove. It was more or less the same for me. Being on your own is terrible. But you've got Hans. Yes. Hans. We've both been here for four years now. We're originally from Stettin. But then the attacks got worse, and my mother had an aunt in Munich. We lived with her. I worked at the hotel then. It wasn't really a proper job, but... you couldn't pick and choose. Yes. And then came the heavy attack. The hotel was destroyed. The flat was destroyed. My aunt died. And no word from my parents. No word for three years. Since then, Hans and I manage here on our own. It's darned hard, believe me. Sometimes I'm scared to death. But that's no use. We have to carry on living, don't we?! That's our only option! Little Katy. Here's one coming. I hope it's yours. Well, then, good night, little Katy. It was really nice. Thank you for not taking me for a criminal. - A criminal? - Yes. You couldn't imagine me taking some jewellery... Jewellery? Well, then, once again... Not yours, it's going to the station! What jewellery? Does it belong to...? Belongs to a very beautiful woman called Nelly. Nelly? And this Nelly... Tell me, did you know the famous actor, Corty? Maybe he knew this Nelly? She was his wife. Corty's wife? My God! And... people think that you took this jewellery... That's-- that's terrible! Sorry, I have to get to the station! You have to wait for the number 4! Goodbye! I'll see you tomorrow morning! It's very important! Watch where you're going! Well? 8. - 9. - 14. - God! - Shut up. 11. Hello, Freddy. What are you doing here? - Freddy. - We're not there yet. - I need it. - What? I'm sorry. I need it back. It's not possible. Hands off, darling. - It isn't for sale. - Kat. What's got into you? Are you mad? I'd got them up to 11. It's an old stunt, Freddy. We know this trick. Are you an actress, Miss? Final offer, 11. No. No. Please don't. What about your carpet and the couch? And the food? - It's impossible, Freddy. - What is it? Okay. 11. Annette? I had to tell you today. Your letters back then did arrive. He only did it because he thought... He wanted to help me forget you. Forgive him, Michael. And forgive me, too. You left suddenly back then, and I was alone. So terribly alone, Michael. And then waiting for years. Wondering and... despairing. Without anyone... to help me... and who was good to me. You love him. Yes. To have someone, to have just one single person today... Michael, you don't know what that means. Goodbye, Annette. And you? "We have to carry on living, don't we?" "That's our only option." Someone else said that to me today. Goodbye, Michael. I'm so happy we talked. Kat? What is it? - I've got the jewellery. - What? - The jewellery they thought you stole. - But... That's right, isn't it? You, too, thought Mr. Rott was a thief. Everyone thinks the worst of everyone these days. And you go along with it? When you love someone—I mean, in general—, then you must trust him too. You have to help him... even if you don't fully understand him. Here. So you can believe him again. Kat! How did you get the jewellery? Everything's all right. I've known about it for three years. In 1944, when there was the heavy air strike, I saw the jewellery for the first time... downstairs, in the hotel bar. The place was in a sad state back then. The proper band had vanished. There was nothing to drink either. I worked in the bar. - Shall I take your coat? Fräulein? - No, thank you, Miss, we won't stay long. The pre-warning has sounded. - Wouldn't it be better if we-- - No, it's a public air-raid shelter. Please take them. Chop-chop! Still waiting for two servings and six cups. It's only the pre-warning. - Guests are guests after all. - They're a fine lot. - Good evening. - Mr. Corty, good to see you back again. Always an honor, Mr. Corty. Do you remember him? Who is that? - May I take your coat? - Many thanks. If you'd be so kind. Just a moment, please. I'd rather keep that with me. Jewellery? It's beautiful. Is it real? Is it yours? - It saved my life. - Imagine that. Did someone shoot you and the bullet bounced off it? No. It wasn't quite like that. A few years ago I didn't know how I would carry on living. And then I was given this jewellery. I got a lot of money from a bank for this jewellery. And thanks to this money, I was able to start anew. And now? Well... I took it back. But I won't let it go again. There's something written on it. "Nelly". Did you get it from Nelly? Yes. Or, more precisely, I found it in my letterbox. My God. In your letterbox? Yes. But it's a long story, young lady. Quickly! - Waiter! - Alarm! No, let's stay here. Eberhart, stay here! Waiter! Full alarm! Please pay, and move along and, above all, do not smoke. The bar is a shelter for our hotel guests. So there's no need for concern. Please take the seats back there too. Doctor, the beds are to the right. Good evening ladies and gentlemen – or, rather, good morning. There are still two very good seats in the corner. - The last service, for you. - Many thanks. Oops, Miss. Good, that's it. - So, let's lay a firm foundation. - Main thing is to have warm feet. Quiet. Attention. Attention. This is the Gauleiter's control center. The strong combat unit has reached our city limits. Bombs are to be expected. Cheers, then. We'll never be this young again, dear friends. Cheers. - It was never this bad before. - There, there. Gentlemen. Thus we live, thus we live, thus we live every day... Attention. Attention. This is the Gauleiter's control center. A further strong unit of enemy aircraft is approaching from Innsbruck. - The first unit is circling above our city. - Hello. What are you doing? My money from the cloakroom. It's safest here. You never know when the lights will suddenly go out. Wait. Take this until afterwards. - It will be safe with you. - Yes. Attention. Attention. Enemy fire over our city. Stay in the shelters. - That's your damn Nazis! - Have you gone mad? Yes, and back then, Mr. Corty... But you know that. The jewellery didn't belong to anyone anymore. And when the digger finally unearthed the cabinet... I went and got it, just this morning. It was to be my deal, you know. And now? I've simply called it off. You get into something, then you're up to your neck. But now I know it was wrong. And why? Kat! Little Katy... THE END
