Cover your heads with your arms. Well, that's it. These boys were real top pros. Nobody spoke a word. No one saw a face. They were in and out of the place inside of ten minutes and away in the stolen caterers' truck. The only words were prerecorded on a drugstore tape cartridge. We'll make a voiceprint analysis, but according to our inventory, from the statements of the victims, they got close to $400,000. We have no way of verifying that. Inspector, may I ask a question? Doesn't it seem just a bit strange that there was no police protection? Now, if this had been a white affair, wouldn't you have had a half-dozen cops on duty? If we had been requested to cover the hail our heroes ball, we would have had men there, just as we would for a white occasion. But even without a request, if we had known the Trenton girls would be there wearing a quarter of a million dollars in jewelry, or that congressman Clayton had planned to turn the ball into a fund-raising circus for his campaign for governor, we would have assigned a squad of black officers in plain clothes to be there. Congressman, could you give us a statement? Number one - I wanna know what happened to the millions of dollars in federal funds that were supposed to improve the efficiency of the Detroit police department. You implying the federal Grant was wasted? You tell me. Would you say the protection last night at the ball was efficient? Does that mean you want a congressional investigation? You said it, I didn't. But it's not such a bad idea. Number two - I want this caper solved, and I want it solved in a hurry. I want to know who was behind it, and I want them punished and punished fast! If the Detroit police can't do it, then I'll put the heat on Lansing, and if Lansing can't do it, there's always the FBI. That's all, gentlemen. In your opinion, inspector, was this a crime by blacks against blacks, or do you think, like congressman Clayton and my colleague here, that it was a honky caper to keep black power from taking over the state government? That's exactly what I mean, so let's have some straight talk. No opinion. Where's bassett? Oh, inspector Chalmers. Danny's over at the hospital. His wife? No, no. Same old thing. Tell him I wanna see him when he gets back. Yes, sir. Right away. I don't have to tell you how to breathe through one of those. You've had more experience with them than I have. Honest to Christ, Danny, if I had your sinuses, I'd get the hell out of this town. The trouble with you is, you're allergic to Motown. That's enough. Feel any better? It's opened up a little, but it still hurts. All right, try one of these. Maybe they'll help, maybe they won't. Only real cure for you is a change of climate or maybe acupuncture. Suppose you tell me how I'm supposed to get out of this town. Even if I had the money, where would I go? And what about Madeline? You poor, sad sinusitis son of a bitch. Hey, doc, fill this up for me? Don't I always? Get that report over here right away. All right. I hate like hell to do this to you, Dan, but I got no choice, absolutely none. Commissioner pulled me off my section. He made me case coordinator for this heist. He wants it solved, and he wants it solved right now. I need you, Dan. It's that simple. Look, I know we haven't exactly been friends lately. I also know the department thinks I stole your promotion. Did I say it? But I didn't, Dan. Did I say it? All I did was go along with departmental policy. I broke my ass with those college night-school courses. Me, a schoolboy at my age. I worked hard in community relations, made a few speeches, shook a few hands, and, yeah, I guess I kissed a few asses, too. And I wasted all that time out in the street busting assholes. This is a different age, Danny. This is a different department. We gotta change with it. All I am is a cop. If that's not enough, you know what you can do. Goddamn you. Everything I learned about police work - I'm talking about real police work - you taught me. All I'm asking you to do is go along with this. It's the hottest bundle of dynamite to hit this city since the riots. You crack this, and everybody in this town will kiss your ass. You'll get your promotion - college points or no college points. Don't give me that promotion bullshit, morg. I find out black assholes pulled this heist, the brothers will claim cover-up. If I say the whites did it, the honkies will say we're pacifying the black community. And if I don't crack this case, you and the department are off the hook, but I get the shaft right up my tender keister. You're really beautiful, morg. You got what it takes - balls. Hi, Lou.Sir. Hey, lieutenant! Howie, how's your love life? Fantastic! Listen, it's so good, I'm even laying a little aside for a rainy day. Hello, Alex. Hi, Danny. Say, lieutenant, I've got these two cheerleaders over at Detroit U, and, well, confidentially, they love older men. Older men, huh? You bastard. What do you got here? Anything? The tire tracks match those from the alley. Footprints are deep, so they were carrying something heavy. Do you think they crossed the river? Canada? Maybe. Either way, they got away by boat. Oh, it's too cold to swim. You don't look so hot. How do you feel? About the way I look. All-night stakeout on the West Side. Nobody showed. So they stick you with this. I'm gonna take a swing up the river. You never know. Anything you get. I know, I know. Hey, lieutenant! Well, what about those two cheerleaders? Give me a yell! Is that the car, Jesse? Description matches. I'll check to see if the man's home. You stay, you come with me, Tim. I'll get the registration. Police. Open up. My god. Jesse, the back way! Hold it! Radio. 2730 calling. Radio, 9000, 9000. Officer in trouble. 9000, officer in trouble. Go on. Try it. Go for it, you bastard. Give me an excuse to waste a goddamn cop killer. Go on! Maybe I'm bluffing. Maybe I don't have the guts to kill you. You're a smart boy, brother. ...Calling 11-2 Adam, 11-2 Adam. Patrol 41 at 18-9-5-5 Mark twain, a 4-year old... What's the story? Harbormaster bureau spotted this floating just offshore. They got curious, so we fished it out. Damn dirty shame about it, too. Young brother like that. Brand-new on the force. Was he married? Yeah. One kid. How about that, huh? You know, with this current, he could've drifted in from anyplace. Well, can the coroner have him, Jesse? Yeah. Let me know which medical examiner will do the autopsy and when. I wonder why they cut off his legs. So he'd fit in the trunk. Now look, bassett, you don't think I had anything to do with it, do you? Since I got out of Jackson state and got this job, I been clean. Believe me. Walker, I'll believe you as soon as you find me another local talent good enough to kill the alarm and the phones and rig that recorder. Suppose they weren't local. You heard something? No. Discussions over a beer. Fine. Who said what? Shit. What's the matter? Those guys at the door - they know me, and they made you for a cop. You're gonna take a punch at me right now. You understand what I'm saying? Make it look good. Really good. Bassett... I'll do better than that. You prick. Welcome to buzz the fuzz. Here's the buzz the fuzz gang. Bob Marquand of the chamber, sid ludkey of the chamber and also the originator of buzz the fuzz, sergeant Fred Williams, inspector Richard Boutin and, of course, commissioner John Nichols. How do you feel tonight? Real good, Martha. I was just thinking... We've had this program on the air for about two years now, and Detroit's still the only city with anything like it. We're really glad about that, too. We're gonna get a whole lotta calls tonight, after that hail our heroes robbery. That's why we asked inspector Chalmers, the case coordinator, and lieutenant bassett, the detective in charge, to be on tonight. That's real great. Now let's take our first call. Hello. We're buzzing the fuzz. Your name, please? I'm John t. What would you like to ask the commissioner tonight? Black people are saying the police knew... No, put it on him. But they're looking the other way, because it was supposed to knock Aubrey Clayton out of the race for governor. - What about that? - Commissioner? That's simply not true. We knew nothing about it. We're putting all the department's manpower and facilities behind our efforts to crack this case. All right, we're going to our second call. You're buzzing the fuzz. Hello? Was it whites ripping off blacks, or was it brothers ripping off brothers? Inspector Chalmers? You better ask lieutenant bassett here that. He's in direct charge. Look like you're on the hot seat tonight. Sit down and answer the question, please. Sit down, lieutenant. I don't really give a damn. You mean you're a honky racist like the rest of the pigs. You don't care what happens to black people long as they keep their place. No. What I mean is, I don't care whether the bastards are black, brown, blue, yellow or green. When an asshole commits a felony, I'm gonna do my goddamnest to bust him. That's what I mean. Bassett, that's enough. I wanna talk to you now. What do you know, bassett? Hi, Sammy. I got a call to be here, Jesse. What the hell's going on? I left it. I caught your act on the air. It was terrific. Could set our public relations back ten years. Nothing wrong with that one. It's just too bad you're not black. You could be another flip Wilson. What else you want besides my autograph? Come on. We fished a body out of the river. It was cut up and stashed in a trunk. So, you're homicide. You get 700, 800 a year. So what? So I got a hot flash. The caper, the abandoned truck, the getaway by boat, then the body in the trunk. I think they're all part of a pattern, all tied together. That's very interesting, Jesse. Maybe it sounds crazy, but you and I working together, we can make it all fit and break this thing, Danny. Another hot flash. Thanks, but no thanks, sergeant. This is my case. If I need your help, I'll ask for it. Maybe you better talk to inspector Chalmers. What you're saying is you already have, right? Interesting thing, Jesse. Hmm? One of the legs was hacked off with an ax or a knife - pretty dull knife. Butchered all to hell. Yeah? The other one was taken off by a surgeon - damn good surgeon. Professional amputation - veins cauterized, stump dressed. How about that. Cause of death? Gunshot wound. Probably a shotgun... In the amputated leg. I haven't run the full procedures yet, but my guess is he bled to death. You could tell us one other thing that would help a lot, doc. So we'll know who we're looking for. Was he a black man or white? I'm afraid I can't help you much there. The guy was an Indian. A redskin. How's it going, maddy? Are they treating you ok? God damn it. My name is Madeline! You know how I hate "maddy." I'm sorry, honey. If you knew how I hate having them touch me, do for me. Who? the jigaboos. I get nightmares. Black hands, black faces, all over me. And when I wake up and ring, what do I get? More black faces. This is a state hospital. They do the best they can. If I had the money, I could... Don't give me that "private home" stuff again. What could they possibly do... I was just thinking you might be more comfortable. I'm afraid I'll only be able to make it up here on weekends from now on. What do you mean? The department's cracked down. All the cops have to live in the city, no exceptions. That's not fair, not to me! There is another chance. I got a good friend at Chrysler. He told me about this place out in Hamtramck. Oh, no, you're not putting me in there, not with all of those bohunks and polacks. You're out of your mind. Maddy, I can only do what I can do, baby. This place takes every cent I can scrape up. If Hamtramck is out, it's out. Oh, Christ. Could anything be worse than marrying a...? What do they call you? Pig! Worse yet, an honest pig! And don't tell me there haven't been opportunities. What would be wrong with doing a few favors for the right people? Nothing, if you wanna be a whore, maddy. Maybe with a few thousand dollars, they could get me out of this chair! Isn't that more important than that sickening conscience of yours? Maddy, more money can't help your case. The doctors don't even know enough about it as it is yet. So I'm hopeless, right? And that means you're stuck with me until I do you a favor... And decide to die. Don't say that, maddy. Too bad, isn't it? Being born and brought up catholic. If we weren't mackerel-snappers, you could get a divorce like... Stop that, maddy... Like that. There's no way I'm gonna buy it. What else could I do? You tell me. You got all the answers. You know how our niggers feel about Jesse Williams. He's their boy. Mr. Pro football comes in, wants to help with the caper. Am I gonna turn him down? No way. Morg, there's one thing. What happens if I get lucky and crack this thing? Who gets the credit - the poor, sad honky son-of-a-bitch lieutenant, or the beautiful black glamour boy? I ask you again, what else could I do? Very simple, Morg. Take me off the goddamn case. Let Jesse have it. Didn't he ask for it? No way. The press will say we're putting Jesse on the spot. Jesus Christ, where are you putting me? I'm on the shit pot with the seat down! Danny, I really hoped as an old friend you'd understand my position. As an old friend, I do, Morg. You're in the position, but I'm the one that's getting screwed. Goddamn. I'm supposed to be giving these fucking things up. Tsk, Tsk, Tsk, Tsk. Such language. Well, it's just the way you like it - hot and black, right? You talking about the coffee? Anybody who has any doubts about black being beautiful just needs one look at my big hunk of manpower. No wonder honkies call us oversexed. You know, in your case, they might have a point. I never had much reluctance dragging you into the sack. Detective sergeant, sir. Something's been bugging you all night, true or false? Mm-hmm. Danny bassett. Inspector Chalmers told me he blew up about working with me. Well, you gotta remember, he's from a minority race. From a what? He's white. In downtown Detroit, he is in a 1-to-9 minority. It's a whole new turnaround situation for the honkies, and they gotta adjust, and it's tough. I don't buy that. Bassett's a pro. It's got to be something else. Baby, I don't know whether this is important, but they were saying in the faculty club that Aubrey hale Clayton's bright, number one hotshot... What do you mean, drew Shepherd? Yeah. They don't think drew was all that enthused about his boss running for governor. Sounds interesting. Uh, Mr. Hunk of man... You know what you are? A raving, out-of-sight, unnecessary sex maniac. And I wouldn't have it any other way. Hey, man, you know this is nice. Not just a police escort, but police transportation and a chauffeur. Nothing too good for our public servants. You know, it's too bad we didn't get together more up at state. Well, you know how it was with us jocks, man. They kept us in cages, let us out on Saturday afternoons for the games. You said on the phone you had a question. Well, not really a question. See, my girlfriend teaches at Wayne state. Said she heard some... funny talk. About what? That you are not 1,000% enthusiastic about putting your boss into the governor's mansion. Funny, huh? Not so funny. True? True. Aubrey hale Clayton is a pompous, posing phony. He doesn't care anything about black aspirations or white aspirations or any other kind of aspirations except his own. The man's in love with himself. I can't imagine anything worse than electing him governor. Nobody could accuse you of evading issues. Why, look what he did the other night. He took one of the best and - all right, I'll say it - noblest ideas to come along in quite a while, and he prostituted it, turned it into a shit pile of a fund-raising circus for his own goddamn candidacy. I hate him for that. So you did something about it? What? You mean, did I hire those trick-or-treaters to rip off the hail our heroes ball? Sorry. No. Whatever my private opinion of the bastard is, he's still my first-class ticket to where I want to get to, and I'm not about to throw that away. Well, the great man's waiting for me. Say, if and when you get 'em, don't be too hard on 'em, huh? They performed a great public service. Clayton! Clayton! Clayton! Clayton! Clayton! Be right with you. Better check in with the commander. All right. Uh, no. Do you understand? I won't. You bitch. If you think some stuck-up whore's gonna put me down... Get your hands off me. You can kiss my ass. You ain't got enough fucking money! Shut up, bitch! I'll kill... You need to simmer down, buster. You wanna swing at somebody, you try me, understand? Who the hell are you? It's not gonna look so good in the papers, is it? Booked for drunk and disorderly in a whorehouse? You a cop? You get upstairs to the party like a good boy, ok? Come on. Danny. We weren't expecting you. I know, Barbara, listen. Ethel wants to talk to us. Do me a favor and get her? Sure, I'll get her.Ok. Now, ok? Ok. Ok.hi. Hi. Don't be a smart ass. You mean that way down deep maybe Danny bassett is human? No. Hi, Danny. Hello, Ethel. How are ya? Fine. How are you? Ok. This is sergeant Williams. We're working together. Hello, sergeant. Big private party tonight. Sorry. Regional sales managers for... One of the big car companies. If stockholders knew what I was charging them for just one night, well... How about in there? Ok, fine. Come in. Would you like a drink? No. No, thanks. Like everyone else, I've been reading about the big heist. You're on it, right? Uh-huh. Well, the night before, we had a couple of out-of-town tricks. They acted all right - that is, they paid - but, well, there was just something funny, you know. I sort of got a feeling. That they were pros, assholes? This man's language. I've talked to him, but... You oughta catch him on radio. I wrote out their descriptions. What I want to know is, how in the hell do they know about your place? How did you know about my place? No, I mean, did they come here to drink? Did they get drunk? Did somebody say something, or were they just here to ball? They didn't come here to talk. Were they white men or black? They were black. We're completely integrated here. Have to be to stay in business. You have a description of the men, right? Yes, there were two. One of them have a mustache? One of them did, a large, full mustache. Full mustache. Did either one have sideburns? The one with the mustache, had sort of... Ethel, you said they were from out of town. They were pros, and someone in the trade knew how to get in touch with them. Thanks, baby. You've been a big help. Oh, Danny, there's... Well, there's something more, a favor you can do for me. Actually, for a friend. You know doc Cooley, I think. Horace Cooley? Sure. Takes care of your girls. The whorehouse Hippocrates. Had a hell of a thing going out there in grosse pointe. Whenever a big-shot starter would get knocked up, Horace got first call, but now, with legalized abortion, forget it. Listen, Danny, the doc has a problem. I told him he should talk to you, that he could trust you. All right, I'll talk to him. Come on, Mr. Lucky. I think it's time to spend some of your money. Let me speak to ferdy, please? Hello? Ferdy? It's Roby. Baby, we got trouble, and it may be bad. What kind? The cops were just here about the caper, and one of them, the black cat, knows me. What are you talking about? Way back. From a long time ago. Look, don't do anything. Just keep your mouth shut. I'll think about it. Sure, I'm a mercenary bastard. I wouldn't make a house call if my mother broke her neck or if my brother's kids found a gun and shot each other. People have a lot of fancy notions about the joys of being a "professional man" these days. I've got a 60% overhead on this place. The labs bleed me white. The taxes are murder. If it weren't for my dear little whores, I'd have to get into something legitimate, like robbing banks or pushing dope. Yeah, it's a tough old son of a bitch of a world, huh, doc? Ethel said you got a problem. She, uh... she said I could trust you, that you play it straight. That works both ways, doc. All right. The night of the robbery, I get a call, late, from Ethel's place. A man was dying. They gave me an address. Rupert arms. A house call? For $2,500, I made an exception. So you went? Yeah. A man had been shot in the leg. He was bleeding to death. I took his leg off on the kitchen table. I had no choice. I told him it was no good. So you took the money and didn't report a gunshot wound? Well, how could I? It would mean the end of my practice, Ethel, everything! Did you call Ethel after that? After I had read in the paper that you'd found my patient in a trunk and the autopsy... My god, I was going crazy. Now, look, you will give me a break, won't you? You said Rupert arms. Yeah. Let's get one thing straight, Milo. Anybody, but anybody, lets our man know about this stakeout, it's your ass, understand? 'Cause we'll roust this joint from top to bottom. Any little pissant violation, and you're busted. You understand me? You can depend on me, sir. I won't say a thing to anybody. Oh, no, sir. Great. As long as we understand each other, we'll be ok. Now get out of here.Damn. Milo, I got news for you. You ever hear of a man called Lincoln? He freed the slaves a hundred years ago. How about that? Hallelujah, praise the lord! Praise the lord. There you see him. The ultimate product of your jive-ass honky establishment - your house nigger. Don't look at me. I didn't do it. Still gonna give these damn things up. Entertainment ain't bad cross-court. Better than old TV reruns. Well, Danny, you interest me. Why? I can try to figure you out. Class of the department - everybody says so. But they're sticking it to you, right up your ass. How about that, huh? You don't even flinch. Why? You know, I minored in psych. Studied all about you quiet guys. I think you're holding it inside, waiting for that big moment to come along - payoff. When it does, you grab it... ...Like that. Take off like a raunchy rabbit. Jesse, baby, you should go into the business. You're a mind reader. Check on my entertainment. Love's a funny thing. Takes all kinds. Things are getting rough over there. Man, stiff everywhere except where I want to be. I always thought you spades were, like, perpetual humping machines. See how wrong a guy could be? Is that why white chicks been chasing us all these years? I wondered about that. Hold it. It's Milo! Milo, you goddamn fool! Jesus Christ! I'm sorry. I figured you been up here all this time, you gotta be hungry, so I brought you something to eat. Milo, you just can't walk into a stakeout like that. How could we know it was you? I'm sorry. I just didn't think. Jesse, bring Milo. Is that him? Where the hell ya going? Yeah, that's him. That's Mr. Hendrix. Milo, pick up your tray, get the hell out of here, lock yourself in the room. Ok, I will. I sure will. Hurry up! What the hell...? Shit! Freeze! Son of a bitch. That's our first real lead. Wonder why the hell he took off like that. If you're involved with a third of a million bucks and a dead Indian, wouldn't you? Shit! God damn it! First break we get in this friggin' case, and we blow it. They're demonstrating over at Wayne university. And they're supposed to march on the city hall tomorrow. Let the fucking idiots march if it makes them happy. Yeah, well, in an hour and ten minutes, I gotta brief the press on our progress. Progress, shit! Why couldn't somebody have notified patrols that we had stakeouts? Nobody's fault, inspector. Well, in 48 hours, I want to be able to announce we broke this goddamn case. Otherwise, you're off of it, Danny. And, Jesse, you're in full charge. That's fantastic, Morg. You really are something. When this come in? The Windsor police ran an ID on your dead Indian. You know, the guy in the trunk. He was Canadian? His place is in the back. We've known Indian Tom a long time, since way back when he ran booze across the river. What's he been doing lately? A little of this, a little of that. Smuggling dope. Bringing across some of your suspects. Handling stolen goods. A fence? Just a middle man, we think, for somebody big. No solid evidence, though. It's over here. Not a hell of a lot to see, is there? What I can't figure is, if the Indian was involved in the caper, why would they shoot him? Double cross? But they paid a doctor to cut his leg off, tried to save his life. Why the hell do that? Paper's a week old. Hmm. Travel folder. Princess italia. Passenger ship? I think our Indian friend was planning a cruise. A getaway? That's no way to go. No, wait a minute. If I were on the lam, I think that's how I'd do it. We cover the trains, the airports and the bus stations, right? Hmm. who would think to check out a comfortable cruise ship? Maybe icebound. Hey! There's somebody out there watching the place. This is lieutenant Dan bassett. We need help with the harbormaster to intercept a small craft - about 20 feet in size, inboard motor, white hull, white canvas top, heading west off Peche island. Good morning, Danny. I heard you two-timed me last night. Wait a minute, what are you doing? Barbara... Hey, let him be, Barb. Saved again. Drink that. It'll do marvelous things for your head. How do you stand it, Danny? You're about as uptight as any guy I've had in here. Nothing new with your wife? Not a thing. And you just take it. Stop by here, get drunk, get laid. For how long? Come on, you know my situation. Nothing can cure Madeline. Just one - money, lots of money. Not for what Maddy's got. I don't mean for what Maddy's got! I mean for you, stupid! Take it from a gal who knows. With enough bread, you can buy your way out of anything. Maybe you're right. I know I'm right. I heard from doc Cooley again. He said it was one of your girls that called him. Roby. roby? Pretty black girl. Oh, yeah. What about her? What about it? A pimp named ferdy turned her out, brought her to me. She doesn't live in. Has a place of her own. Would you believe Roby's got a college degree? In what - screwing? Yeah, but did you talk to the witness? What about the m.O.? I don't... hello, roby. I'll call you back in 20 minutes. Have a seat, babe. I'm glad you could make it down. Ethel was right. You're a classy-looking broad. She said you wanted to talk to me about something. Yeah. Roby, who was it that had you call the doc? A John. What John? A trick at Ethel's.What was his name? I have no idea. I've never had a trick yet tell me his right name, and I just wasn't paying any attention. But you went ahead and called the doctor for him, anyway? Yeah. 'Cause he said it was a matter of life or death, so I called the doctor. Did I do something wrong? I mean, a cat asked for help, and I gave it to him. And so you have me down here and you're harassing me for that? And that's your story, roby? It's the truth. You don't know anything about the robbery at the hotel? Why should I? I mean, any more than anybody else out there on the street. Look, I came down here because I thought I was helping doc Cooley. And you're throwing all these off-the-wall questions at me! Do you have some bag of tricks in your closet you just pull out every time you see something black walk in here? I don't believe you pigs! You don't believe anybody, do you? I bet you don't even believe each other. Who do you believe? Just because I called a doctor, that's why you have me in here? Hello, Benny? Is that computer still warm? Yeah, it's bassett. Run an m.O. Check for me, ok? Sloane. Ferdy Sloane. Yeah, a goddamn pimp. One girl in his stable named roby Harris. See if he's ever been mixed up in a robbery or any kind of a heist. Yeah, I'll hang on. Let me speak to ferdy. Hasn't he come back from Canada? Yeah, baby, I'm glad you called. If you're so glad, how come you didn't get in touch with me, baby? Do you realize I've been sitting there at that house waiting for you? Ok, but did everything work out? Nothing worked out. The fuzz were there ahead of me. I got chased by a pig boat, nearly froze my ass off, and they nearly blew my brains out. We're in trouble, ferdy. The cops are on to me, about the doc. I already told you, the black cat knows me. That's why you got to do what I tell you. Now, you call them. Offer to turn in the gang that pulled the rip-off. I can't do that, ferdy! I just can't. I gave you my reasons. I told you what went down. Reasons, my ass! You want to get us both sent up? Now, look, you'll make him a hero. He'll be so goddamned grateful, he wouldn't dream of charging you with anything. What about you? Ain't no need in bringing me into it at all. You just leave me out of it. But listen, ferdy, you know... Now, baby, you wouldn't want to see your sugar man dead, would you? 'Cause that's what I'll be. These guys don't play around. But once we get 'em locked up, everything's gonna be just lovely for the two of us. Just lovely. As long as you do it. Ferdy? Ferdy, don't hang up... Listen to me! Ferdy! Ferdy! Ferdy? ♪ I'll keep my baby warm ♪ keep him wrapped up in my arms ♪ through the cold and rain ♪ even on wintry domains ♪ I will stand the wind, the storm... Ferdy, you there? Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it! Hold it now! You two dudes want to knock heads, we'll put gloves on you, put you in the ring. Any more fighting on this basketball floor, and you answer to me, you hear? All right, now let's shake hands and get on with the game. What's the matter, your hand tied down? No. Well, come on, then. All right. Let's play ball. Let's play ball. Toby's shooting two. I thought you retired from all that crap. Well, you know, once a jock, always a jock, I guess. What do you got? Maybe a lead, maybe nothing. Wanna come along? I'll get dressed. Hey, now, ain't it a shame to mess up a pretty face like that? And I hurt my hand, too. And for what? For that dirty, lousy, little son of a bitch ferdy! Why don't you make it easy on all of us, honey? Tell us where he is. I don't know. Damn it, I don't know! Oh... I'm not cut out for this kind of business. Call the damn bar again. Jeez. Come on! Roby? Roby? Lieutenant bassett. There was a car in the alley. They got away. What the hell's going on? All right, take care of her. I'll get an ambulance. Roby? Roby Harris. Jesse. It's been a long time. Too long. Way too long. Yeah, lieutenant bassett. We need an emergency ambulance. Wait a minute. 1222 14th street. Yeah, a gunshot wound, female. Take it easy, sugar. Ambulance is coming. When I saw you at Ethel's, I just couldn't believe it. How many years has it been? How many years? Ethel's? You mean, you're one of her...? Ferdy, my... my old man, wanted me to call you to make a deal. But I just... I just couldn't, Jesse. I just couldn't. I didn't want you to know about me. A deal? What kind of deal? You mean the big robbery? I thought ferdy had hid it here, but ferdy... Ferdy's too smart for that. He... Don't talk anymore now. Once we get you to the hospital... But I've gotta tell you how it was. I've... I've got to. I've got to. Ok, now remember, it's a real VIP this time, a very important customer who specifically wanted a black girl. Listen, it could do the place a lot of good, so, you know, make us proud of you. I'll give it the old college try. See that you do. Ok. ♪ And the going gets rough ♪ I will be right there on hand... Hurry up. The man don't like waiting. ♪ Help him make a stand ♪ yes, I will, now ♪ I'm gonna wrap him up slow, yes, I will, now ♪ in a blanket of love, yes, I will, now ♪ I'll suffer anything ♪ sure as you're born ♪ I'll keep him warm ♪ ooh, yeah ♪ I'll keep my baby warm somehow ♪ so this cold world... Hey, this is the service entrance. It's service, isn't it? Now remember, I'm not even supposed to be in town yet. I'm gonna make a dramatic, last-minute flight in from Washington just to be here. I don't... She'll do. In there. Get your clothes off. I'll just be a minute. Old man Trenton'll be ok. He wants a favor from me after I'm elected. He'll have his girls there. They'll toss a quarter of a million into the pot just to get the ball rolling. But before we leave our hail the heroes ball, our black brothers will toss a half million into the war chest easy. Reverend, you're hitting the sauce. If you foul up that ball, it won't be the devil that'll run a hot poker up your ass. It'll be me. My acceptance speech. The spontaneous acknowledgment of my unexpected draft. Copies are in the bedroom, come on. Free press, the news, wire services, television stations, radio. Hail our heroes is gonna put me in the governor's chair. See you in a second. Never enough time. If I didn't have to do everything myself. Come on, let's get it on. You know how it is. Some guys just gotta make time to get their rocks off, no matter what. I'm like that. Oh, baby. Ba... That was good, honey, real good. You're ok. Oh, that's your job. You're the cashier, huh? If you've got any ideas, it's paid for. The day I follow Aubrey hale Clayton on a wet deck, that day, I cut my throat. Get your clothes on. I'll take you back. Hey, I can deal with a honky. I mean, but do you know what really pisses me off? It's that the brother thinks he can run this shit on me. He was acting like I wasn't even a person, like I wasn't even there. Look, baby, you gotta realize that not every black man is your brother. Now, um... what is this you were saying about the congressman and this half a million dollars? Who's talking about half a million dollars? I'm trying to tell you what the cat did to me. I'm a human being, and I've got my rights! Ferdy, look at me. I can't keep taking this abuse. Look at me. Look, honey, we're gonna get rid of all of the abuse, but it's gonna take money. Now I want you to sit here and try and remember everything you can about this fund-raising thing. I'm gonna go and make a few phone calls, 'cause, baby, this is the big score. Ferdy, you haven't been listening to me. He pulled it off. He pulled it off. He really did. Poor ferdy. They had to hole up. And he was half-crazy. Why are they holed up, roby? Where are they? Tell me, please. You remember, Jesse, that first night after Holly hill? Remember where we went? Try to think, baby. Where are they? We were just kids. We didn't know what we were doing. The gang and ferdy - where are they? After Holly hill... So nice. And it was so sweet. Even though... Holly hill. That's great, Jesse. Great, great. I knew you'd do it. Yeah. Oh, too bad about the girl. Uh-huh. Had all the confidence in the world in ya. Both of ya. You did a great job. I was behind you all the way. Uh-huh. Let me talk to Danny. He isn't? No. Check you later. How you doing, man? I don't know. Where's bassett? If only roby could've lived long enough to tell me. Unless... come on, Sam. After Holly hill... So sweet, so nice. Even though... Holly hill. "After Holly hill..." Suppose she wasn't just remembering. What if she was trying to...? God damn it, Sam. Maybe I'm sticking my neck way out, but I think I owe her that. Owe her what? Sergeant Jesse Williams. Dispatch three cars to 25th and Joes... We're all set. Sure hope you know what the hell you're doing. You and me both, brah. Cops, man! Everywhere! Get our asses out of here! Halt! Motherfucker! Hey, look, look! Wait! Wait a minute! You don't have to hold on to me like this! I was looking for you guys! You don't have to worry about me! I was gonna find you, but these guys were shooting at me, you see? Sergeant, look what we've got. Man, I'm glad to see you. You're glad? Yeah. These guys were getting ready to kill me.Shh. Hey, I know you. You're Roby's friend. How do you know that? I saw your picture in her place. I'm ferdy, her sweet mack.Ferdy. You know what? Seeing as you're Roby's friend and seeing as you guys saved my life and seeing that you're a brother, I'm gonna make you a hero. You keep saying we saved your life. It's true, man. After what happened to the Indian, these motherfuckers grabbed me outside of Ethel's and were gonna cut my balls off unless they got their bread. Then why'd you kill the Indian? We didn't kill him! That stupid motherfucker killed himself. Jesse? yeah. We just got a black dude in the cemetery. The mounted boys got a white cat heading for the river. Another black dude cracked up in the car, and the other one, you put down. All dead. Very integrated operation. Do you know everybody's screwed up? This whole city. Everybody but Danny. He's the only one that saw it the way it was, man - just another rip-off. It's like he said, "assholes are only assholes." Fo' sho. It went like a dream, man. We were in and out of that hotel before hallelujah Markham could even get off an amen. You got yourself a real team. All pros. Henry got 'em. All from out of town, except for him and me. All we had to do was to drive to the island, lay the stuff on the Indian and wait for him to bring our money across the river. He was gonna fence it? Yeah. That goddamn feather-wearin', bow-and-arrow motherfucker. No wonder they always lost. Look, can you dig this? He had a rusty old shotgun in the bottom of his boat. We're passing the fucker the loot, and the fucker kicked it and damn near blew his leg off. Ha! wasn't even a homicide. Look, man, what could we do? The bastard wouldn't tell us who he was dealing with over in Canada. We got him a doctor, tried to save him. If roby had only called you and made the deal like I wanted, it'd been so much easier. And she'd still be alive. You... you mean Roby's dead? Mm-hmm. At your place. Your own dudes, looking for you. That's awful, man. Son of a bitch. There's gonna be a lot more of those, man. You know, 'cause I'm gonna make you a real hero. You understand? As long as you don't forget who worked with you and cooperated all the way. Let's make sure the stuff is here first, then we talk deal. Oh, it's here, man. Nobody knew where I left that shit, not even roby. It's gone. It's gone, man. What the hell are you trying to pull? Nothing! It was there, I swear before god. Not a goddamn thing. It was there, man. It was. It was in an old yellow travel bag. And nobody else knew? Why would I lie to you, man? Why would I lie? It's my ass, ain't it? I'll take that, sir. We've been expecting you for quite some time. This way, sir. I think you're holding it inside, waiting for that big moment to come along - payoff. When it does, you grab it... ...Like that. Take off like a raunchy rabbit. Jesse, baby, you should go into the business. You're a mind reader. If I were on the lam, I think that's how I'd do it. We cover the trains, the airports, and the bus stations, right? Who would think to check out a comfortable cruise ship? Oscar Beauford is the name. We haven't met before, but... Lucky we did, right? I mean, for both of us. Right. I was forced to conclude that I wouldn't have the chance of meeting you. As you can see, I've left the ship. I was going to fly to Europe tonight. Please sit down. That was a dirty shame, what happened to the Indian there. Hmm? the Indian. Yes, most unfortunate. When he expired, I'm afraid I was at somewhat of a loss as to how to proceed. Oh, then he kept his mouth closed to you, too? Oh, Tom was suspicious of everyone. However, did you just guess where to find me? The only thing the Indian said when we made our deal, he mentioned the name of a ship. I asked myself, "why?" So, you see, it's a good thing you had your man watching the dock. I mean, so we could make the connection. Yes, Mr. Larson has been out on deck constantly, hoping. It's all in there, hmm? You understand the payoff has to be cash, of course. Of course, of course. One thing I'm curious about. None of the local fences would touch this stuff. They claim it was too hot. My primary business is in the middle east. The growers of poppies are distrustful of paper money. But things like these - gold, jewels - they'll gladly accept. So you'll use this stuff to buy your opium? And turn a profit of several million. Not bad. Not bad at all. Well, if everything's ok, what about my cash? Well, everything's ok, as you put it, except for one little detail that I'm curious about. Our Indian friend was quite close-mouthed, except that he let slip one little item to bring you here. That's right. Well, he did the same for me. He told me nothing except that he had made his deal with a... Black man. You knew all along, didn't you? We were just playing a little game. Outside! Outside! Don't try nothing. You understand? Nothing! Don't move a muscle, you bastard! Jess... Ferdy wouldn't take a chance on keeping a loose stash at his place, not a goddamn pimp! Is that how you guessed the stuff was stashed at Roby's? I almost did it. Jesse, I almost made a million-dollar bust. I had to go it alone before the news broke. I had it! Are you being for real? Man, I thought... Once the shit hit the fan, no chance. Oh, if I was black... If I was black, Jesse. God damn it, Danny! Give it to me straight now. Were you really going for a bust or were you gonna grab that bread and run? Give me my squeeze bottle in my pocket. Ok, Jesse? Get it, Jesse. My sinuses are killing me. Danny? Danny! My god. My hat is off to all of these men. I believe that Detroit, the state, the nation owes them a great debt. Inspector Morgan Chalmers, the case coordinator, given a thankless job and discharging it nobly. Sergeant Jesse Williams, a great athlete and a great policeman. You will be hearing a lot more from our brother Jesse. And last, but certainly not least, a tribute to one who gave that last full measure of devotion - his very life. Lieutenant Daniel bassett... Died a hero. He risked his life to play a lone hand. How else, if he was planning to take off with the loot? He brought great credit to - as we like to say - the best damn police department in the country. A great policeman. Maybe. Or maybe just another crooked cop. Any comments on the racial aspects of the case, congressman? I certainly have. It seems to me that the way a black policeman and a white policeman working side by side, hand in hand, were able to crack this case points the way to a future, not of black brothers or white brothers, but merely brothers. Once I am established in the governor's chair in Lansing... There he is! Great athlete, great policeman! That stuff was beginning to pile up over my head in there. I know. I heard. You are illegally parked. So give me a ticket. You know what's gonna bother me the rest of my life? What? Oh, just trying to figure... If he was the worst cop I ever knew or the best.
