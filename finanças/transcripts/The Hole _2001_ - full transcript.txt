Which number do you require? Behind me is Brabourne School where news is just in that the missing teenagers have been found after 18 days. Now, the waiting is finally over. The 4 teenagers attend Brabourne School where fees are in excess of 30.000 dollars a year. - There are unconfirmed reports that they have all been taken to a local hospital where their families have been anxiously waiting. Michael Steel, son of rock guitarist Stevie Steel, was one of the missing. Lizzie, my Lizzie. Liz, Liz? Liz! See you inside. - He's going to kill us. Liz, Liz, Liz. - No, stop. Hi. l'm Doctor Horwood. l'm here to help you. Thanks. Don't put me on Prozac or Lithium. l'm not crazy. lt's just my mum, she won't listen. l'll listen. Do l have to talk about it today? - You make it sound so terrible. lf you trust me and you work with me l really think l can help you feel better. So we do this at your speed, yeah? We can stop at any time. l won't lie to you, this is going to be difficult, but l know that you're brave enough to get through it. Let's try a breathing exercise. lt might seem really stupid, but let's just give it a bash, ok? Take a nice deep breath. Feel your lungs fill up with air. Good. Drop your shoulders. And when you exhale, tell all the muscles in your body to relax. And whenever you feel ready, just start to speak. Ok? This is how it works at Brabourne. lf you want to exist you have to be pretty you have to be thin, everyone else is wallpaper. For years l was a nobody. l watched the world from the edges and learnt not to dream. - Oh, is he? My best friend, Martin, didn't care. His philosophy was, take everything you can from them. He said that greed makes them easy to control. lt made him powerful. But then the world changed. Get ready, girls. Mike Steel is single again. Oh my God. Mike Steel American. The son of a rock star. The missing part of my soul. Please get up. Please, please be ok. Get up. Sorry, mate. l see why this lot need to wear body armour. lt's a homoerotic thing. All that aggression out here, and then all that steam and soap in the shower afterwards. - That's disgusting. Right, you two. Off! Maybe Geoff will be Mike's new bride. - For your information, Martin, he's dating a supermodel called Amber. - For yours, he's not. You lie. - Don't you live here? Haven't you noticed that everyone's a blonde with cherry lip gloss? There's an invasion of Amber clones. lt's passed you by. Thank God for that. Last woman with a brain in Brabourne. - He's single? Half a brain. Yes. Oh, not you too, Liz. Please don't lose it. l didn't know. - You wouldn't think he was so perfect if you knew him. He shits and farts like the rest of us, he's just a fuck of a lot less interesting. - l can't help it, it's an egg thing. When l look at Mike l see the face of an angel and the soul of a poet. l need him. - No. No, you love me. lt's a Martin Taylor fact. Has there been a day in the last 5 years that we haven't talked? - But you're more like a gay friend than a boyfriend. - But l'm not gay! Yeah, right. lt's the end of term. l've got some grateful exes to call and most importantly l am out of here. Hello, there is the small matter of the geography field trip. Bentley, school gates, Friday. Off to LA. Bye. Nice time. Oh, you are such a jockey Stevie will have a shit fit if you don't go. What, you think l'm gonna tell him? l'll go in a hotel. He'll never know. My arse. Tabloids are gagging for you. You are having a wet weekend in Wales with no hot water, fish paste sandwiches and ten mile tabs, like it or not. - Ah, that's awful dark, Geoffrey. Shit, l don't want to go either. We have to ditch. l'm serious, this could kill me. Frankie's not going. She saw wellies on the kit list and nearly had a seizure. Well, how'd she get out of it? - Well, she saw Martin Taylor. Frankie? Frankie? l need to talk to you. Come. What's she done this time? - My hair, it's all gone wrong. l've messed up. Let me see. Did your mobile give you a tumour? - Do you mind? My course work doesn't write itself, you know. What is it? - lntensive conditioner. lt should have you sorted in 20 minutes. What did you use? Peroxide. - Well, where from? The lab. - Oh, Lizzie. l just thought if l was a blonde, like Amber, then... l don't think that doing stuff to yourself is make a difference to Mike. No, l know. - Oh, don't worry about it. Trust me, he's not that wonderful. Frankie? Thanks. l know you don't have to be nice to me. - Don't worry about it. My life has no meaning. - Come in, make yourself at home. l love him and he doesn't even know l exist. l hate seeing you like this. Hey, l can cheer you up. l've got chocolate. Martin, you don't understand. You've never been in love, you've never had the pain. Oh God, l feel like l'm dying. l can help you. Really? - Really. Welcome to my office. Now this is a need to-know operation. Can you do it or not? - No field trip. No parents, no paparazzi? l can do anything. And... l'm adding one to your number. A kindred spirit. Martin knew that the school and our parents always believed each other. He called it ''The Unholy Alliance''. So, if our parents thought we were going to Wales and the school thought we were going home they'd never question it. Aye aye, here come the troops. Jesus, you're late. Did anyone see you? Just back from the Himalayas? Liz, Frankie you know. Geoff, l'm sure you've heard of. None of it is true. - Except that one about the butter. That's true. And Mike. Well, here's nothing. l'm not spending all weekend sitting on a tree trunk. You can't see the wood for the trees. ls he taking the piss? Are you taking the piss Martin? l could snap your neck like that! - lt's right here. Can't you see it? You have about 10 seconds. - lt's right beneath your feet. Oh, yes, Martin? Watch out, ladies. Oh, dear. Oh, are you all right Hey, l'm coming down. Hang on. Oh my God, how cool. - Hello. Yee-ha. Whoo. Oh, man. - Shit, how deep is it? Man, where'd you get the key? - Wouldn't you like to know. And what is this? - You know the old war bunker over there? This is the escape hatch. - You're so weird, dude. Will you have to close it? l need fresh air to keep my skin clear. - Oh, right, it looks beautiful. Oh, stop it. - You don't wanna be found, do you? No, we certainly don't. Nice one. See you later. You're going in there? - Of course l'm going in there. See you inside. - The power's on the left. Oh, man, what is hat stench? lt looks like a tomb. - And? And l ain't going in there. Ah. Like l care what you think. Can't be any worse than Wales, right? Me next. - That's practical, Frankie. Did you get that smell? What is that? - Jesus, man. All right? - Yeah. You all right? Watch out for that bit. Oh, man. Mikey, look at this, man. Check this out, this is huge! Look at that. What is that stuff? Ladies, you are gonna love it down here. l'll get them to send it up to your room, Frankie. - Shut up, Geoffrey. Be careful with it. This way. - Jesus, it's so dark. Right, l'm going first. - Oh God. Yeah. The ladder stops, mate. Oh, no, it's cool, it's just... Here, do you need light? - Yeah, shine it down here. Enjoy the Mike Steel experience. Do you think he'll fall in love with me? - Just be careful. Liz, watch the step. - Mate, take a look at the pit. Here, pass the rucksack. - You guys all right? Yeah, we're cool, cheers. - Close the door. Bye-bye, Martin. Bye-bye. - Stop. No, put the lights on. l'm here, Frankie, calm down. Can you put the lights on? l don't like it. Can't you find the light switch? Would you look at lights. What do you think, girls? What do you think? Pretty damn good. Ah, oh my God, Geoff. l shot you in the back like six times, dude. You're dead. You're in the way! Die, scum. Get out of the way. Get out of the way of the woman. Get out of the way of the lady. Get out of the way of the lady. You're gonna die. - No. Would you mind if l boiled some water for my pasta? No, not at all. Do you want to go first? - Yeah. Sure. Cheers, l'll... lt's great stuff. lt's got this hole down the middle so it cooks quickly. Have you got a pan l can borrow? There you go. - Cheers. What are you having on that? - Nothing. You can't have pasta and nothing. That's nice. That's really nice. l've got salt. Do you want some? - Pasta and salt? No. Thanks, though. What are you having then? - Not really hungry. Eventually. - Didn't really bring anything. So you didn't bring any food? - Got a bit of gum. How do you expect to survive for 3 days? - lt slipped my mind. l mean, it just didn't occur to me, you know. - Oh, ok, so food slipped your mind? l've got food. l've got sausages, beans and noodles. Plenty for everyone. You can have as much as you want. You have sausages? Do you have tomato sauce? Some. - You enjoy your pasta, ok? l'm having sausages with Liz. Tonight. Frankie? - No, no, thanks. l'm on a diet. l've got fibre pills to stop me feeling hungry. Ok, it's my turn. My friend was driving his girlfriend in his Ferrari What? Who do you know with a Ferrari? - Bob. Bob and Sally. - Oh Bob. Bob and who? Mike, don't! Bob and Sally went for a drive, but they ran out of petrol in nowhere. Bob went out to try and find some and Sally was left in the car. So she switched on the radio and they said that there was, like, this crazy madman on the loose but she was really tired and so she fell asleep. - Man with a hook was on the roof. With Bob's head on a stick. - On a hook. No, this really happened! - Oh yeah, yeah, Frankie. Ok, l've got one for you. Make you cack your pants. What? - Shut up, man. Something happens to Martin. Doesn't come back for us. Told ya. That's sick. - Possible. Don't be stupid. - Geoff, you shouldn't say that. What if you make it happen? - How can l make anything happen? You'll jinx us. - How? Well, it's tempting fate. - Oh, please, how does that work? Lizzie? - l'm a scientist. l don't believe in fate. - Mike? l'm a Scientologist. l'm with Liz. - Well, fine. But if anything happens to Martin, then it's Geoff's fault, ok? - lf that's what it takes to get you to shut up about it, then fine. - So is my story the best or what? Ole ole, ole, ole - Liz? Liz? What happened on the third day? Don't you want to know what we did? - Martin was supposed to let you out? Liz? Liz? - l don't know. What don't you know? - What happened. You're quite safe here. Deep breaths. Look at me. lt's the third day. You're all packed and ready to go, right? What's the time now? - Same as when you asked 2 minutes ago. lf 2 minutes have passed, can it? - lt's three thirty-two then. So then, where is he? The field trip's supposed to be back in 30 minutes. l have a driver waiting. This is so... lf he's been hit by a bus and he's in a Coma, can't tell anyone where we are? Oh, please. - What if he's dead? He's not dead! l'll call him. What's his number? No they don't work down here. - Here, look, let me try. Are you getting anything? - No, nothing. You know what maybe give it a shot up, up by the door. Does it work? - No, nothing. You've jinxed us. l knew you would. - This is a wind up. No, this is your fault. - Hey, you guys have you ever thought that maybe the traffic's heavy? - lt's cool, l'm not worried. Help. Help. Liz, Liz, it's fine. Everybody just calm What do you think l'm trying to do? Please. Shut up and let me get on with it. Stinking mad. - Hey! Hey. Hit it with the pipe there. l'll tell you what, why don't you have a go, darling? - Go on, have a go! Ok, so, they haven't found us. They know we never went to Wales. As far as they're concerned we have a 3 day head start. Which means they could be covering a 3 day radius of the school. That covers like, the whole world. Now? - We're being held to ransom until Martin says so. We can't do anything. - Oh, no don't say that. l mean, he could just be ill. lsn't that right, Lizzie? l don't know. - But why? l mean, why would he do this to us? We're his friends. Are we? ls he really your friend, Frankie? l know he's not mine. Think about it. l don't know a thing about Martin. And he has no morals, no ethics. Everything's just a game to him. What, so this is a game? Oh, that's great, that's fucking wonderful. Oh my God, l paid for this. - Yeah, but he's careful nothing's left to chance. Right now we're trapped because he wants us trapped. - Why? Well, l guess we're gonna find out. Liz, look at me. - He didn't come back. Martin didn't come back. You cracked it, l knew you would. Now, right after l got your message l told the lads, this fucking great cheer went up. Good job, Doc. The hunt for the kidnapper of the teenagers took an unexpected turn today as it was announced that the police have arrested a pupil from the school. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons was located in the Dominican Republic where it is believed he was on holiday with his family. l've put together a very rough character sketch based on the information that we have. Locking the children in suggests that we have a sociopathic personality. He think what he's done is not wrong, he probably thinks he's above the law, better than all of us. Right now he's probably creating a very strong alibi. The longer he has to conjure up this fiction, the harder it's to crack. And if you want a confession, you're going to have to act quickly. So when the police arrest Martin will they put him in a cell? l presume so. Good, l hope they do. Let's see how he likes it. All right, let's start. - Hang on. Ok, l'm ready. Can we talk? - Sure. Shall l come over there? Ok. Can l get in? What's up? Can't sleep? lt, it's about Martin. l think he's watching us. l saw a shadow pass the slat. lt could be nothing, l could be wrong but l think it might have been him checking up on us. - lt probably is him. lt's so funny you know, Stevie sent me here to protect me from the nut-jobs at home. l think l know what Martin's doing. Go on. Martin wants me to see that it was stupid of me to like you when l don't even know you. He wants me to hate you. We're still down here because he was wrong. He hates being wrong, so we're stuck down here until he's right. - Hold on. You knew this would happen, even before we came down here? No, of course not. But it's the only explanation l can think of. But what difference does it make? He likes you, doesn't he? Yeah. Since we were eleven. One of those. - Yeah. But you like me? Yeah. Sorry. Don't worry about it. But how does he know you don't hate me? l mean l don't l mean, how could he work that out from a split second at he door? l don't know. What is it? What? ls that what l think it is? - Yeah. Are there more? Try that one over there. Which one? - This one. He's covered the whole place. Frankie, what's going on? What is it? Liz, it's the middle of the night. What? She needs a doctor. - Well, that's obvious. l thought you were supposed to be smart. l bet it's that dirty toilet water that's making her ill. lt's not my fault. - Yes, it is! This is shit. This is the worst time l've ever had. l hope l never see you again. - lt's not that bad. No, things are very bad. l mean am l the only one who can smell the toilet? l mean, l've been polite, but who left the monster log that we can't fucking flush? We're fucked and it's all your fucking fault. Why me? - Because he's your best friend! Yeah! - More, more. About me. l should have never came down here. As soon as l saw you, you fucking geeky little fucking bitch l should have turned the other fucking way. Just stay the fuck away from me you fucking loser. You're not so great yourself, you know. You're full of shit. What are you, anyway? You're just a face and hair. Oh, shut up you fucking comebag! We waited and waited and nothing happened. But it worked. The next morning Mike woke me up, and the door was open. We were so happy. We were out. We all grabbed each other and just stood in the light. lt was over. We'd beaten him. We'd won. What Martin didn't realise was that l'd even won Mike. We ran up as quickly as we could. Mike gave me a great big hug and he said ''You saved us''. ''You saved us all''. Here we are. Right. Well done. l told you you'd get through it. How do you feel? - Lighter. Last night, l even closed the door all the way and l didn't panic. Excellent. You've made a lot of progress. We've still got a lot of work to do. - Oh. Yeah, but you'll get there. lt's, it's really good l'll see you later. Ok? Bye. - Bye. Yeah, Tom here. - Oh, Tom, it's Philippa. Listen, she thinks she spent the last week in fucking Disneyland. l'm sorry, l didn't see it coming. - l'll get a confession out of Martin. l mean, how delusional can she be? So, l suppose you've got fingerprints, then? DNA? CCTV footage of me creeping around or a stack of witnesses with twenty-twenty? Do you even have a motive? A bloody good reason why l should bother to lock up a bunch of socialites and throw away the key however tempting that might be? - What did you do on the last scool-day. ls she deaf? ls she thick? l mean, can they really keep asking the same question hour after hour? Please, just so we're clear. l got up at seven a.m. as usual. l cleaned my teeth and had a shit. l was down at breakfast by seven-twenty a.m. as usual the matron ticked me off the list. l had two slices of cold toast with warm butter and sweet tea as usual. l returned to my study and arrived at the school minibus at eight a.m. and was sat on the minibus by eight-o-five. l sat beside the driver because l wanted to sit on my own. We left for the station at eight-thirty a.m. and arrived at a not unreasonable eight forty-five a.m. l bought a Telegraph and a KitKat and then caught my train promptly at nine-o-five from platform two. l was alone until Charing Cross where l was met by my mother who parked the car in the wrong area and got a ticket as usual. Martin, we know why you did it, how you did it, the whole fucking lot. Elizabeth has told us everything. Well l knew she was fucked in the head, but l didn't realise she was vicious. Well, you, you know Liz hates me? You do know that, don't you? Thanks for taking me home l can't wait to get into my own bed. You'll feel better once you get back into your old routine. Now if you need anything day or night, just call me, all right? You can go back any time you want. l have to get back to the real world. You said so yourself. You really don't know anything, do you? Liz and Frankie are best friends. They're thick as thieves. Are you sure? - They're practically the same person! Boring, vain, shallow enough to paddle in. But Liz is the really nasty one. Do you have a pen? This is how it is at Brabourne. lf you want to exist you either have to be a bitch or a complete slut. - What is it? Amber dumped Mike half an hour ago. Oh, fuck. Come on. lt's your big chance, what you've been waiting for. Oh my God, l'm going to be sick. - Move quick, girl or you'll be auditioning with every peekaboo slut from London up. l don't just want him l really want him, Frankie. l've got a plan. - Let's hear it. We go to the beach again, but this time we camp out for a few days. lt'd be perfect, the sea air, the stars. - l hate beaches. All that sand up your crack, nowhere to pee apart from the ocean. And it dries out the complexion. l look 40 if l spend 10 minutes and you want me to go there? Remember that place we found and said it would be great for a party? The S and M dungeon Martin tried to take you to? What if we did that? l could get Mike pretty much on his own for a few days and we could even ask Geoff for you. - The four of us? Yeah. A private party, the end of term. Me, you, Mike and Geoff. Oi, oi, Frankie. Dangerous place for a lady. - lf you say so. Out. Neil, out. She's not here for you. Couldn't have come at a better time. l'm ready if you are. How would you like to go to the best private party of your life? - Are you going? lt's my party. -How private? - You me Mike and Liz. Mike never mentioned it. - That's cos you're inviting him. l don't know if l could do that. -3 days absolutely extracurricular. Your parents don't know and the school doesn't know. What we do would be our own business. But if you're too pussy then l'll ask someone else. - l never said l wasn't interested. ln or out, Geoff? - ln. But you have to bring Mike. - l'll speak with His Highness. Anything? Put your knob away. Go. - D'you do it? Yeah, done. lt will be great. Please. - Man, l'm telling you, this is different. This is ten out of ten. Frankie and Liz. Real ten out of ten. - So what, you're gonna go home to an empty house and fuck the maid all Easter again? You haven't seen the maid. Plus Amber won't know where you are. Won't be able to find you. She'll assume you're having a more exciting time with more famous people. Drive her nuts. - All right, l'm in. When you're convinced of your own absolute superiority you don't need help from mere mortals like me you can fuck things up all by yourself. So there you have it. l thank you. - What time did you lock them? Because l know you did it. - How dare you be this wrong and this fucking pigheaded! How dare you put my mother through this bullshit. l mean, how do you know it was me? l'm dying to know. Come on. One of them is lying, l have to talk to her. Why wait when this girl can tell me what l need to know. - But if you start demanding things from her she's likely to go back to silence. - Well, that's a risk l have to take. ln twelve hours he walks. - Tom if you say one word to her l will fucking kill you. Just let me go. l'll get the answers. He's going to get away with it, right? - No, you mustn't think like that. Did he ever keep a diary or journal or anything like that? l don't think so. Did he have any kind of secret hiding place? No, l don't know. Why? What's wrong? You're not going to let him out, or? - l'm afraid that's not my decision. He's gonna come after me! - No, he won't Liz, you're safe. ls he out now? - No, but he will be in a few hours. A few hours! You said l'd be safe. You are safe. - l trusted you. But you've just been pretending the whole time because you're paid to! That's not true. - Leave me alone! l can help you. Nice one. You don't want to be found, do you? Sweeties. Geoff, pass it up. Give it here, come on, give it here. - You want it? You got it, baby. Hi. So who do you want first? What are you talking? l'm dancing. - Wrong approach mate. Frankie, l've got something for you. Oh, fuck off, Geoffrey. - Stop being such a fucking tourist. l am not. Jesus. - ls there sex or not? Not. Especially not with you. Yeah? - And especially not in here. l mean, have you seen how dirty it is? - Yeah, l have. And why would there be sex? l mean, what have you done for me? No, l don't think so. Sorry. Look, Frankie, you know we've had a lot of anticipation and it's been medically proven that you know, this kind of teasing can really ruin a young man's nuts. Fuck off, l have heard this all before! - So you have to. Hello. - Hello. l need some more. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. l'm going first. Come on, get it off. Come on. Oh, careful, it's expensive. Now l've wanted to see this for the last four years. Frankie. l've had this. lt's ok. What, seven eight out of ten? - Mmm, four. Oh, thank you. - Frankie! We were, what, thirteen? l mean, it was a one night stand, it wasn't exactly memorable. - l'm a lot better now. But you liked it. - Uh-huh. What the fuck is wrong with you? Fucking nut-job. - Yes, oh, yes, Lizzie! Thank you. How does it go? - That's it, no more free feels. What am l meant to do with the old man? - Suck it off, big boy. Whoa. Ten out of ten! - What? What, what did she do? Oh, go on, give us a look, Franks. What did she do? Nothing, Geoff, nothing. - Oh, come on, Frankie, do it again. Forget it, it's supposed to be a party. lt's a shit party, but it's a party none the less. - You always get to see everything. Why's it always you? - Can't we have the light on? No! l can't sleep if it's light. - Well, it's too dark to sleep. How can it be too dark? Shut your eyes, what's the difference? Well, l can't tell when my eyes are open or closed, it's so fucking dark! Oh, shit. - lt's only me. Never fear, Geoff's here. - Can we get some sleep, please? Will you shut up! What are you doing? Turn the light off. She must have spent days picking the lock, but she did it. She beat him and l'll beat him too. He had a website called ''Disciples of Chaos'' full of anarchist bullshit about disrupting stock exchanges, air traffic control, the web itself. l'm gonna nail him. l don't think he's angry enough to have done it. Hi. Thanks for meeting me. - No problem. Shall we go straight there? Sure. - lt's just up the hill. l'm not great with small spaces. - Neither am l. l can't stand them. But believe me, that will be the least of your worries when you get down there. What were they doing here? - They were trying to have a good time. With plenty of booze and party lights. - The prime suspect has been released without charge. The police have yet to make any formal statement and it is understood that their investigations are proceeding satisfactorily. The families have requested that the press res... God. But you can't go, the trip doesn't get back for another two days. Mate, you said you'd do this. - Fuck the trip. Fuck things up for the rest of us. - Do you know what? The thing is, l don't know what to do. - Please, don't go, you'll ruin all. l'm not gonna stay down here and listen to you 2 fuck each other's brains out all weekend, ok? No, l don't think so. - l'm trying. l'm leaving, too. Oh, not you as well. - l'm not playing gooseberry. Are you going straight home? We could stop by the station and get a pizza. l'm starving. - No, thanks though. Trains go to London all the time. - Yeah, no. l know. Look, l'm, l'm gonna go by Amber's, see if l can patch things up. lt's been awful between us. - Amber? But she humiliated you. How the fuck would you know anything about that? Enjoy yourselves l'm out. Hey, Mikey. You're weird, mate. Mate, you said you'd do this. - And you said it would be fun. You are gonna have a great weekend. You're gonna get laid. lt's gonna be fun. Enjoy this. - Come on, Mike, please. Stay. You're gonna have a great time. You'll be here completely by yourselves. Enjoy it, all right? - l hate him. What's up, Liz? - l can't open the door. Can you move out of the way? Watch this. - Fuck! lt won't open. Well, push it you twat. - No. The handle's stuck. Oh, you are such a donkey, Mike. Liz, down. Let me sort it out. You are such a cretin, Mike. - Look, l'm not fucking retarded, ok? The fucking door won't open. - Oh, get out the way. Who was the last one down? - Geoff. How fucking hard did you slam it? - lt wasn't me, it was Liz. lt's a heavy door, it slammed itself. - Doors don't slam themselves locked. Sorry, l didn't know we'd get stuck. - This is bullshit. You're sorry? What the fuck do we do while you're sorry, or do we just fucking rot? - l guess we just wait to be found. ln 2 days my parents are gonna be up, waiting for me. And if l'm not there, they know l never went on the field trip, that l told them a pack of lies. l'm gonna be up to my arse in shit! - Good fucking job, asshole. Well how long before we're found, Liz? - l don't know. Shit, l am in so much trouble. - Perfect. Help! Anyone, help! Somebody try the glass. We have to do something that might open the door. Fucking bitch! You fucking bitch! You all right? Why don't we sit down. Thanks. lt's been a nightmare for forensics. They can barely lift a usable print. lt's gonna take us 6 months to sift through all the hair and fibre. What about the listening devices? - The kids probably mistook the small air vents for microphones. Lack of food and water would have made them totally confused and paranoid. So, do you have anything to tie Martin Taylor to the scene? Not yet. But he will have left something somewhere. And we'll find it. Right. Thanks. - Ok. Open the door. You bitch! Open the door! Liz. Liz! Sorry! l'm sorry, l'm sorry! - Bullshit! Bullshit! l'm sorry. - How could you do this to me, Lizzie? You fucking betrayed me. - No, they let you go. l knew they would. - They won't leave me alone. They want me for the whole thing. - They can't prove anything. lf they could they would have done. - But you grassed me up, you bitch. Hello? Hello? What happened? You've gotta get me out of here, please. l don't feel safe. l don't want to be alone. l don't feel safe. All right. All right. Liz, Liz, come on. Calm down, all right? Take a deep breath. Come on, calm down. Listen, l can help you, but you've gotta stop playing games. The Police and l need to know what happened, we don't care how terrible your story is, we need the truth. - l want to know the truth, too. l want to go back to the hole. Absolutely not. No way. Keep getting glimpses of what happened. l'll be doing something like tying my laces and l'll turn around and l'll see Frankie. But when l try to remember, l can't. There's nothing. Nothing at all. And l don't know what happened. l want to know, but l can't remember. Do you want to be re-admitted? And we can work through this. No. l need to go back to the hole. There's no escape, Tom. Mrs Dunn called again. Moaning Doctor Horwood's run away with her child. Threatening to call the press Police Complaints Commission if we don't get off our arses and find her. - All right. But l bet you they're having a pizza somewhere. - Do you want the rest? Go on. Amaze me. - Yeah, l will. lt's about Martin Taylor. Come on. Come on. Looks different. l don't even feel as if l've been here before. Liz? Liz? Hey, Mikey? You're weird mate. You are the cretin, Mike. - Come on dude, you're getting laid and you're getting laid. lt's gonna be a great time. We weren't locked in from the outside. Shit, l am in so much trouble! Fuck! Shit! l don't believe the stupid. Did you try the glass? What could l do? l couldn't let him leave. Carry on. Guys, guys. The water's gone off. - Are you sure? l just went for a drink and there's no water. What? What's happened? After you start to feel thirsty you'll find yourself feeling impatient. Maybe even a little sick. Then your pulse starts to go up. Then there's the headaches dizziness and when it gets bad your vision will blur and you'll find it hard to walk and talk. Your tongue swells up. Your skin shrivels. You twitch. You go deaf. And then you die. How long does this take? - From when we run out of water about three or four days. - How do you know all this? Army cadets. Liz, Lizzie. Lizzie, it's gonna be fine. lt's gonna be ok, Liz. l mean, we're bound to get rescued. God, they'll find us. Next week we'll be down the pub and we'll be having a laugh. l promise you. - And l'm buying all right? lt's gonna be all right. - And we'll go out and buy lots of new things. - And there's all of those exciting exams to look forward to. - Can we look on the positive side? l've got a hard on for those exams. - You've got a hard on for everything. Not for you, mate. l'm ok. Have you ever loved someone so much that you didn't care what happened to yourself? You just had to be with them. lf they look at you your heart stops. lf you feel their breath on your skin you just ache. Have you ever craved someone so much that you didn't exist any more? No. Well, l have. Guys? Hey, guys. Liz? Guys. Liz. Frankie's sick. Look, l'm serious. She's very, very sick. lt just keeps coming out of her. Oh, so you're fucking her now? You know, he really doesn't kiss the way l thought he would. l always thought he'd kiss me really soft, but he kisses really hard. You know, you could have told me about you and Mike. But l suppose it doesn't matter any more. We're getting on so well. lt's like we've been together for ages. l think he's falling in love with me. He is, yeah, he is, l can feel it. We'll probably sleep together tonight. l bet we'll get out tomorrow. l have a really strong feeling we'll get out, you know, like someone will find us, right? Do you think you can hang on that long? Frankie? Franks? Frankie. Frankie? Frankie! - Get away from her! Get away! Frankie, wake up. Frankie, come on. Frankie speak to me! - Oh my God! Frankie, wake up. What's wrong? Oh, shit, what have you done to her! Frankie, what's wrong? Frankie, what is wrong? Wake up! What's wrong? Geoff. You fucking killed her! What have you done? What have you done to? l didn't. - What did she do to you? What did she do to you? - Geoff, Geoff. Geoff, it's fucking horrible, Geoff. Please, stop touching her. Please, Geoff. She's fucking dead. Stop fucking touching her! l'm so sorry, Frankie. Frankie, l'm so sorry. What happened, what did l do? You were my best friend. What am l going to do? l'm sorry, Frankie. Don't fucking look at me like that. l hate it. lt's not my fault if you don't like what l have to say. Frances was bulimic. We know that from the lack of enamel on her teeth. The dramatic bleeding came from a tear in her oesophagus. She died on the tenth day. From heart failure. Carry on. Do you think she'll haunt us? She'll haunt you. - Why me? Why you? Why you? You fucking bitch! Because it's your mistake. Your idea. Your fault. You! - Does that help at all, Geoff? lt's shit in here. - You! Geoff, she's sorry isn't it obvious? She didn't do it on purpose. Just fucking leave it. - You didn't care about fucking Frankie. You're right. l didn't give a fuck about Frankie, right? We're just a pair of fucking assholes, right? l keep thinking about her mum and her dad, and about how they're going to feel when they find out. l've killed all of you. l killed... No. No, you didn't. - l did. lt's my fault, l'm sorry. Look, ok it's not your fault, ok? lt's not your fault. l don't know what happened to Frankie, but it wasn't you, ok? lt wasn't you. Really? - Really, ok? So what we've gotta do is try our best to keep strong. l don't really blame you, Liz. l'm just going nuts. l keep thinking l can smell the body. l think l'd rather tear my face off than smell her rot. l've got such a terrible headache. Everything looks blurry. l know what that means. lt's all right, Geoff. Don't think about it. Take it. Take it. Thank you. You ok? l'm sorry. Mike? - What are you talking about? l'm sorry. - You're not well, you should lie down. l have to tell you something. - Listen, it's the dehydration. No, Mike. No, Mike. - Please. Please, stop torturing yourself, ok? lt's not important any more, ok? lt's not your fault. - No, l have to tell you something. What? You fucker! No, Mikey. Mikey, l was gonna share, l was gonna share! No, stop! Geoffrey Bingham. Severe head injuries. This one was murdered. Oh my God! Look. We could go together. Fuck, no. - l can't do this any more. This food will keep us going a little while longer. We could still be found. We're not going to be found. They would have found us by now. Look Mike. lt'd be really quick, right? We'll just fade away, it will be over. You're stronger than that, l know you are. Ok? We've kept going this long, we can hold out. Please. lt's worth it. Lizzie, l can't do this without you. You've kept me going. lf you go l'll have nothing. l need you. l love you, Liz. l love you. How the fuck did you do that? The key. l always had it. But l couldn't tell you. How could l? But it, it was all for you. - For me? Because l love you. All this was for you. For me? l killed my best friend. You let me think l was gonna die. And you watched me kill my best friend. l killed him for a fucking coke. You let Frankie die. You fucking held her hand and you let her die, you fucking bitch! Fucking whore! You fucking bitch! Where are you? No Mike. Mike, no! What are you doing? You don't understand. What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it! He was the reason l breathed. l stood there felt my heart die my soul wither. l wanted to be with him so much that l could just feel myself stepping into the air. Then l thought at least this way he never grows old he never cheats on me never leaves. This way he just stays perfect. You need to say what you've just said to me on tape. With a solicitor. And your parents present. Why? - Your statement needs to be official. l'm not making a statement. - You have to. That's what the families and everybody, the police, have been waiting for. l just told you. They're not going to understand. Look, even you don't understand. l don't see why l should be punished. lt was an accident. - You were still responsible. l'm not ruining my life for this. - lt's out of your hands now. Martin will corroborate. - Everyone is dead and you told them that l locked you in. l was away. l had no idea you couldn't get out. lt's too late. Philippa, what the fuck are you doing? - Help! Help! Thank God! - What's wrong? Thank God. Help! Help! - lt's ok. l was so scared. - We have Martin. You're in deep shit. - You have Martin? Yeah. Suicide. Guilty as hell. Subtitles: VlCOMEDlA 04/2002
