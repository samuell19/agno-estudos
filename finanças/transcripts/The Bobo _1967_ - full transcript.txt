[car engines running] [cars honking] [tires screeching] [car honking] [jazz music] Olimpia. Ah, Olimpia beloved. I'’ve been calling all day. '’I have wonderful news. We can have three whole days together.'’ '’My wife is in Madrid. Three whole days.'’ Look, it'’s the same color as Posmoso'’s ribbon. We can fly to Al Qatar. The weather is beautiful now. '’Remember the sunset over Gibraltar, sweet--'’ - The name of this machine? - It'’s a Maserati. What is the cost of it? Uh, it'’s for millionaires. Precious one, we'’re wasting time. Hurry home and pack. [dog whining] You like it Posmoso? [dog barking] [Olimpia] '’Posmosa likes it.'’ I will call at four. Three whole days. - Impossible. - Tonight? - Maybe tomorrow. - Alright, alright. Tomorrow. For lunch. [tires screeching] [cars honking] Come on, Gamazo. Your play. [car engine revving] [tires screeching] [jazz music] Olimpia! Olimpia! [shouting hysterically] '’Olimpia!'’ '’Olimpia.'’ Oh, Olimpia. Please. Please let me in. What have I done, madam? Olimpia, please. Oh, angel. I'’m mad for the love of you. '’Olimpia.'’ [knocking on door] '’Olimpia. Olimpia.'’ '’I'’m mad for the love of you. Olimpia. Olimpia.'’ '’I think it is a disgrace for the neighbors.'’ If the neighbors don'’t like it, let them move. You can'’t have that crocodile weeping every time you'’re home. I don'’t intend to. Get the pencil and paper. I want you to write something down for me. Ten seconds shorter this time. She cannot have enough of me. I thought by now she'’d had everything. She has, she throws me out of my furnished apartment left to me by my grandmother and then changes the door locks. She uses my new British sports car and won'’t let me near it. Why don'’t you go to a lawyer? Eugenio, fill up. I can'’t afford this scandal. I come from a very good family. My brother'’s a priest. My sisters are nuns. Without people like you, nuns and priests will be out of work. You have no complaint. Sure, Olimpia is a witch. But the most desirable witch in Barcelona. She is much-much-much.. How long did you have with her? Two. Two ecstatic months. Me, she would not give even two hours. Senor,no woman wants a man who is smarter than she is. Mostly they prefer idiots, if you'’ll excuse me. I had two-two ecstatic months. You remind me of a person who'’s enjoyed the meal of his life. And now he'’s angry with the restaurant because he cannot take home the dishes. Olimpia wants to see you. - Olimpia? - Don'’t ask me why. Did you hear that? She wants me back. She wants me. I'’m coming. [car honking] [tires screeching] [jazz music] Oh. Oh, lovely, lovely. - Pepe. - Yes. I want you to do me a great favor. - Yes. - Set this up in print for me. Oh, yes. Yeah. Pleasure. Oh, it'’s very dangerous, madam. Look it-it'’s untrue. I could-I could go to prison. Pepe, have it ready tomorrow. Why can'’t you tell this man that you are through? Why must we go through so much trouble? Printing a few simple words is too much trouble? It'’s not the printing. Why can'’t you say to this man "goodbye?" I'’m in the lift, Olimpia. You want me to say goodbye to you? No, no, no, madam. Olimpia. [guitar solo] [pinball machine ringing] - You have cheese sandwiches? - Manchego cheese, 15 pesetas. Fifteen pesetas for Manchego cheese? In my village, you could become ruptured lifting 15 pesetas of cheese. These prices are fixed or negotiatiable? - Fixed. - I'’ll have a coffee. Your cheapest blend. I'’m looking for senorCarbonell, the impresario of the theater. It'’s a matter of mutual profit. You know his whereabouts? I'’m sorry. - He visits your establishment? - Not very often, no. With such prices, I don'’t blame him. Perhaps, senor, you know this Carbonell? I'’m told he'’s a very keen judge of talent. So I'’ve decided I'’ll give him the opportunity to discover me. What is that you have to be discovered? Just that I'’m Spain'’s greatest singing matador. '’What is your name?'’ Juan Bautista. Professionally, Bautista. The grand mata-troubodour or trouba-matador. I'’ve not yet decided. When do you sing? Before you fight the bull or after? I sing before, after and during but not so much during as it'’s difficult to sing when I'’m running. '’That'’s why I concentrate more on the singing.'’ The arena'’s no place for a coward. I'’m not a coward. When there'’s more blood going out than in one must make a decision. '’Is there a place where Carbonell resides?'’ He'’s out of the country. You know that for a fact? Go back to the village where you can at least afford a cheese sandwich. I'’m obliged for your concern but I'’m here in Barcelona to establish my career and I'’ll not leave here until I have. Meanwhile, if this impresario should come in you tell him, please, that Bautista was here. Excuse me, senor. What is that you'’re drinking? It is Cognac with the white of an egg. It looks just as if someone had expectorated in it. Please. I'’m sorry, but it looks just like that. She wants me back. She wants me back. It'’s the happiest day of my life. - Tell me all about it. - I'’ve better things to do. But before I go, you must celebrate my victory. Eugenio, everybody orders and I pay. I'’ll have a cheese sandwich, please. Oh, how do you do? Very well, indeed. Thank you very much. Also a coffee, your best blend. What bliss. What bliss. Little did I dream when I woke that such happiness was in store for me. Happiness is many things to many people. To you, it'’s the lips of a woman. To me, it'’s the ears of a man. We have a philosopher with us, eh Carbonell? Ha, never mind. You are Carbonell, the impresario of the theater? Hello. - I do not deal in amateurs. - '’Alright. That'’s alright.'’ I'’m not an amateur. I'’m a semi-professional. I'’m booked six months in advance. - We discuss now for later. - I discuss nothing. [Carbonell] '’Come back next year.'’ Life'’s unpredictable. Many misfortunes can happen by then. I can lose my voice. You, your hearing. - Let him sing, senor. - No. - Let him. - I have a nose for talent. I can smell it. I smell nothing here. Except old socks and Manchego cheese. I'’m sorry. I don'’t wish to argue with your sense of smell. Please, give me one moment'’s attention. Anything. Name anything you wish to hear. I-I improvise. I'’ll make up a song around any subject. '’Anything. Name a subject.'’ Bulls. Bulls? - '’You did say bulls.'’ - Yes. I said bulls. It so happens that I'’ve got a song about bulls. Good. Big, black bulls. Yes. Very well, I will begin. Is there any particular key that you'’d wish me to sing in? If you have a key, I'’ll build a song around it. Any key you like. There'’s a good key. That'’s a good key. I'’ll begin with the traditional tenor and then I will become modern. It'’s very essential these days to become modern. Modern styles and trends.

Look, I come here to drink and relax. If you don'’t ask him to leave, then I must go. No, no. - I know when I'’m not wanted. - Do you? Oh, yes. I'’ve been told to leave better places than this. Ha ha. You know.. ...people said to me I would find much hostility and indifference in Barcelona. But I have not found it so until just now. People have been kind and generous except for you, senorCarbonell. I tell you, you'’ve been rude and uncouth. I hope you enjoy your Cognac and, uh, whatever it is. It is a very dangerous thing, preparing a false news story. I could even go to prison. [doorbell buzzing] [spraying] - Hi. - SenorFlores, SenorGamazo. How do you do, senor? SenorGamazo isan important journalist with the Barcelona Express. Ow, oh, I shall come to the point at once. Hm? As you know, senor it is the ambition of every good journalist to dig out the stories before the rival newspapers can. Of course. Hm? And that is what I have done in your case. My case? A man of your standing is extremely newsworthy. - '’Front page.'’ - Thank you, thank you. What'’re you trying to tell me? I have a story that may shortly appear in my paper. The more sensitive sections are underlined in red. What is going on here? You can read, senor. '’Thank you for the compliment.'’ It'’s what I don'’t read that I ask about. What is this, Olimpia? I really do not know, Silvestre. Pepe, who is an old friend found my birth certificate and discovered I do not have the age consent. You have passed that age. Perhaps. But you see, we live in a small village and my papa was lazy and didn'’t go to the city hall to make a record of my birth until later. So, on the certificate, I'’m only 16. - Alright. What do you want? - For you not to see me again. Well, since you and your journalist friend here have gone through this trouble to draw my attention to the discrepancy in our ages I'’m forced to admit it'’s wrong for an experienced man of the world such as myself, to be seen around the public with a woman of 16 and perhaps jeopardize her reputation. So, in due of all these details, I reluctantly agree that we shall not meet again. I bid you goodbye. As a parting gift, from the shop next to the showroom.. ...a large box of candy. With the greatest of pleasure and my kindest memories. Just leave the candy on the front seat of the Maserati. [car engine revving] It'’s out of the question. It costs 800,000 pesetas. It'’s a special order. - Pepe, call my lawyer. - '’You have a sports car.'’ - '’What'’s wrong with that?'’ - '’Chrome'’s rubbed off.'’ - A Volkswagen? - No! Mini Cooper S. - No! - Chevrolet? Pontiac? - Chevrolet and a Pontiac? - Only Pontiac. Pepe, call my lawyer. I'’ll not give you the Maserati and that'’s final! You give me the Maserati. I'’ll give the Triumph Spitefire. You can'’t give him the Triumph, it'’s mine. - Go back to the telephone. - It is my property! - Do you want a new key? - What? - Do you want a new key? - Oh, thank you. SenorMatabosch has waited nine months for the Maserati. And I have waited 24 hours and even that is too long. Pepe, call my lawyer or the police. Call! Alright. And the tank to be full, please. What a pompous fool. Did you see him turn red like a lobster? Please, leave me now, Pepe. I'’m tired. Oh, mm...of course, of course. Who-who would not be tired after the...terrifying ordeal you have sustained. I will, I will return later and everything will be like before. Oh, the-the-the key to the apartment, darling. Thank you, thank you. Oh, sorry, sorry. It'’s only your Pepe. I forgot to take the.. ...newspaper story with me. It'’s not right to leave it in a place where you might.. ...lose it. [banging on door] '’Olimpia, open the door!'’ [saxophone music] '’Wh-why you locked me out..'’ '’Olympia, open the door, please.'’ '’I want to get it. Will you let me in, please?'’ Let me in. Olympia.. [man singing] You'’ll never believe this, but there is a bull fighter on a ladder, singing outside my window. - Hello. - Oh! I decided I'’ll give you another chance. Leave me alone. I will make you one final offer and then finish. Well? Install me in your theatre, one day with no pay. Refused. - Alright, finished. - Good. - Tomorrow, we talk again. - We will not. Alright, we talk the day after tomorrow. Senor,please listen. Any day, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I'’m available. You name the day. I'’m ready. - Cognac and egg. - Cognac and egg. - No egg. - One day, no pay, please. Why don'’t you sit with that other poor fool, huh? Why do you classify me with him? I don'’t even know him. You think you'’re a singer and he thinks he'’s a lover. Senor,but every man fancies himself a lover. You'’re also talented in that field, huh? Not talented, senor.Gifted. But, you know, it'’s not discreet to discuss these things. Senor,I will make youone proposition. - Not in here! - No, listen, listen. Senor,if you will install me in your theatre, for one day I will personally guarantee to you to be waiting in uniform-- - Stop right there! - Here? - There! - Alright. [saxophone music] - I am stopped, senor. - Alright. You want an engagement, you shall have it. Senor,you will not regret this. We will both become rich and famous. One week at two thousand pesetas. That is more than generous. I'’ll have a cheese sandwich, please. Yes. Senor,you will plead with me to remain two weeks at ten times the amount. But, uh, there is a condition. Oh, I accept regardless. Accept regardless. You must, within three days, conquer Olimpia. - Oh, senor,that'’s stupid. - Please, please, huh? - What, uh-- - Cheese sandwich. - Yes, yes, yes. Manchego? - Si. Hm, what is, what is Olimpia? What is an Olimpia? A shrewd, mercenary beauty who makes herself available only to a privileged few. Olimpia.. '’Olimpia..'’ That is one of the privileged? Every woman'’s entitled to one mistake, senor. [chuckling] Senor,excuse me. '’If this is your plan to get rid of me'’ you must prepare for a large disappointment. Three days. Not one minute more. Why trouble me with an adventure with some person I don'’t know? Why delay my debut at your theater? You'’ve heard the offer. Take it or leave it. No, I accept. First, I'’d like to settle the details of my engagement in advance. We discuss it, if and when. Please, senor,in advance. My name first above your theater in green lights flashing Bautista, Bautista Bautista, Bautista, Bautista. '’Then, I will sing five songs'’ '’with ten songs in reserve for encore.'’ Oh, oh, alright, alright. Now, please, go. Yes. But I have one final point. Senor,how will you know that I have succeeded? I mean, I cannot expect that this, uh, Olimpia will furnish me with an affidavit. He makes a reasonable point, senor. You must remain in her apartment long enough for the lights to go out and remain out for one hour by my stopwatch. He'’s reasonable, eh? Where is this Olimpia? Tell me. [jazz music] [engine revving] [whistling] [music continues] Ramon, quick. Come on. Give that woman outside the Mesarati and the papers. - But it'’s for SenorMatabosch. - Do as I say. - Excuse me, senorita. -Yes? - I'’ve come for my Maserati. - I'’ll go get the papers. Would you first show me the working of it? Of course, senorita. Isn'’t it beautiful? Is it very complicated? No! This model is the Mistral 2 plus 2. It has a special five forward speed, Matabosch gearbox. Excuse me one moment, senorita. [jazz music] - SenorFlores? - Mm? Matabosch is here. What am I going to do? I don'’t care what you do. I only know what I'’ll do [whistling] - Are you comfortable? - Yes, thank you. - You look good on the car. - You look good on that floor. Thank you. It'’s a remarkable machine. It has many, many refinements. For example, there is a special device for perfumed air should one be driving in heavy traffic. Oh, how thoughtful. This is the finest leather imported from England. You know the Maserati very well. Are you a salesman for SenorFlores? No, no, no. I'’m an owner. - An admirer. - I too am an owner. You have an exquisite taste, senorita. They say one needs two things to own a Maserati. Money and patience. It is nine months delivery for such a car. Oh! I had to wait less than 24 hours. Oh, you'’re remarkable. You must teach me how it'’s done. - I don'’t give private lessons. - Are you buying another one? - No, it'’s my first. - It is also my first. - I'’m here to accept delivery. - Which one is yours, senor? - This one. - This one is mine. It'’s impossible, senorita. It is my special color. Senor,one cannot own a color. I negotiated with SenorFlores and it'’s mine. I apologize for disputing you, senorita,but it is mine. - And I paid in advance. - I too paid in advance. I will speak to SenorFlores. But I'’m sure you'’ve been misinformed. Flores! Flores, what is all this about my Mase-- Don'’t ask me to explain. I'’ll refund your money with interest for nine months-- How dare you sell my Maserati? I will get you another one. I'’ll go personally-- Go personally to Zanzibar for all I care. You will never ever again enjoy my business nor that of any of my friends or associates. Senorita...my apologies. SenorFlores has let you have the car that was intended for me. It'’s not my problem. Naturally, and I respect your rights, uh, fully. Well, should you or your senora care to borrow the car for a day or so-- I'’m not married. I'’m Carlos Matabosch. And I am Olimpia Segura. It'’ll take them a few moments to prepare the car for driving. May I offer you a cup of tea? Yes. SenorFlores. SenorFlores. He'’s not angry. They'’re already friends. - '’They'’re going for a walk.'’ - You'’re wrong, Ramon. He'’s not walking. He'’s on a table covered by a white sheet and she'’s wheeling him into the surgery. SenorCarbonell, how do you like this? The pure gold voice of Juan Bautista. Chromium plate is more suitable. - Chromium plate? - Hm. The chromium plate voice of Juan Bautista. - Perfect, yes, yes. - Mm. I prefer pure gold, but you'’re the boss. You'’re the boss. If you want chromium plate, you'’ll have it. I'’ll do it now. [murmuring] [honking] Hey, she got the Maserati, huh? Matador, there she is. - Who? - Olimpia. Oh, ho, ho, ho. Oh! [jazz music] Mm. '’How long you said I had to go?'’ '’Three days.'’ Mm. It'’s a four day job, but I will do my best. Yes, yes. - Why are you waiting? - I'’m not waiting. You look like a person who'’s waiting. I may look like a person who'’s waiting but I assure you, in reality I'’m much more like a person who'’s not waiting. - Please, go. - Yes, yes, yes. [jazz music continues] [crowd cheering] [trumpet music] [crowd cheering] Hey! [cheering continues] [whistling] SenoritaOlimpia, may I present myself, your servant? Juan Bautista, the bearer of an important message. What message? It'’s too important to be relayed on a public street. However, if you'’ll meet me at an agreed place and time I will present to you a check.. ...for 250,000 pesetas as evidence of my master'’s good faith. My master is His Excellency, the Count of Vilalbana. You'’re a messenger of the Count of Vilalbana. That is correct, yes. And he'’s offering 250,000 pesetas just to meet me? That is correct. How does he know me in Barcelona? Well, you know, he visits Barcelona frequently on.. ...business matters. It'’s quite possible your name was spoken. - Are you a gipsy? - Oh, no. I'’m not a gipsy, no. [car revving] Alright. You will come to my apartment here, number seven at 6 o'’clock for five minutes and no more. And you will bring the check for 250,000 pesetas as evidence of your master'’s good faith. I'’ll tell you what I'’m going to do. I'’m coming to your apartment, number 7 at 6 o'’clock for five minutes.. [tires screeching] [engine revving] [female #1] '’Never trust a gipsy.'’ The Count of Vilalbana would never have a gipsy for representative. - Count of who? - Vilalbana. [doorbell buzzing] Felicitations in the evening, senorita. - Are you alone? - Yes, of course, I am alone. Usually with this outfit, there'’s a bull. - Ah. - '’You got five minutes, talk.'’ Yeah. Well, uh, to further identify myself, my full name is Juan Bautista Marabio Milagros Kihote Del Castillo Isaias. I'’m a retired matador. A freeder, if ever I saw one. '’You mentioned earlier something about the check.'’ Yes, a check drawn on the Banco Central for 250,000 pesetas. What is this elaborate signature? The signature is Martin Erimon Bocalast Vilalbanal Egure Contrerus. Count of Vilalbanal. Notice it has the flourish of Alfonso the XIII. That is because the Count is of royal blood. Excuse me. [whispering] It'’s not payable to anyone. It'’s blank. Yes, uh, um, I was about to point out that it is blank. Should you agree to the proposal that I will shortly introduce you merely insert your name and you have it. And what is the proposal? That the Count is desirous of meeting you tonight. Not to evaluate you. You'’ve been presented in most glowing terms. '’It'’s rather for you to evaluate him.'’ In any case, after the initial meeting, I am authorized to cash this check for 250,000 pesetas. I have only to meet him for the money? '’That is correct. Yes.'’ Of course, he would enjoy a subsequent rendezvous, but that'’s naturally your option. And where is he now? He'’s here in Barcelona, waiting. Patiently waiting. Let me examine that check again. [Juan] '’One could purchase luxuries with such a sum, senorita.'’ What do you think? I don'’t like it. I'’m sorry, no. You see, I'’m dinning tonight with a gentleman of great wealth and position. It could be the beginning of a long friendship. Possibly marriage. Ah, yes-yes. Well, you'’re wise indeed to refuse. The Count offers nothing more than an evening'’s frivolity. You know how it is with royalty. It'’s a pity, though, because if you weren'’t already engaged I would'’ve suggested meeting the Count merely out of curiosity for it'’s not often one has the chance to meet a person of such wealth and position and to be paid for the privilege. Anyway, good evening, senorita. If I could postpone my engagement where would I meet His Highness? Well, His Highness has suggested a meeting place. It is the most unlikely choice, but he'’s an adventurer in all things, you know. Let him come here. He will refuse to come here because you see the meeting would then take on the vulgar aspects of an interview. Trust me, senorita. Why should I trust you? I'’ve never seen you before. True. But ask yourself, to what advantage is it for me to deceive you? To steal your money? Your jewels? Your.. That'’s ridiculous! That is not only ridiculous, it'’s impossible. [guitar music] [singing in Spanish] How much longer will I have to wait for this Count? Hm? How much longer will I have to wait for this Count? The Count will be here. Just sit back, relax and enjoy yourself. Your gonna have a wonderful evening. Look, it'’s gonna be wonderful. [music continues] [clapping] [feet tapping] [tapping continues] [tapping continues] Allow me to purchase another bottle of wine. '’Oh, no.'’ There'’ll be no further eating or drinking if I'’m paying. For the taxi, the cigarettes, for the wine I paid-- Senorita,whatever happens, the Count must not be blamed. You will be refunded. I promise you. [guitar continues] [crowd cheering] Bravo. I must'’ve deserted my senses to give up an evening with SenorMatabosch, take me home. I can see you'’re angry. You'’re completely justified. '’You'’re a lady of quality and you'’ve been inconvenienced.'’ Well, I am not going to allow the Count the satisfaction to arrive here and find you waiting for him. I'’ll request the bill. Waiter. Give this lady the check. [bell buzzing] - Who is it? - The gipsy. '’I'’m not a gypsy.'’ '’Senorita,please. I have amessage, an important message.'’ - It'’s that idiot matador. - Senorita,don'’t talk to him. [knocking at door] Senorita,I have a very important message. If it is from the Count, I'’m not interested. His Majesty has called four times. - He is sick with apologies. - It'’s of no importance. He'’s flying to Madrid within the hour but will delay if only you'’ll agree to dine with him tonight. I have an arrangement tonight. I'’m dinning with SenorMatabosch of Matabosch Tractors at The Retreat. - At The Retreat? - Yes. Oh, what-what an amusing coincidence. Why? Well, because, when I explained to his Majesty.. What a beautiful home you have. When I explained to his Majesty your displeasure with last night'’s meeting place he asked me to tell you it was chosen only for its flavor of mischief and frivolity. And he was hoping to make amends tonight with a place of a very different environment. And where do you think he had chosen? - It doesn'’t interest me, Juan. - It'’s The Retreat. The same place you are dining tonight with Matabosch of Matabosch Tractors. So you will have missed nothing. Except, of course, the 250,000 pesetas. I would have to labor the rest of my years for half this amount and here it is, available only for the efforts required to eat a gourmet'’s dinner and to drink champagne. '’Amusing, eh?'’ No. I made an arrangement with SenorMatabosch and I cannot possibly cancel it now. Yes. I understand. To drink champagne with royalty for 250,000 pesetas-- Goodbye Juan. '’Oh, it'’s stuck.'’ Yes? I'’m so sorry to bother you again, but a small piece of the Count'’s check became lodged in you door. I'’m sorry. Oh, it'’s alright. I can easily have it repaired. Why can'’t he write a new one? Oh yes, of course, he can. But what point is there if you don'’t wish to meet him? Get Matabosch on the phone. I'’ll give him the old standby about your mother coming? No. No, tell him my three day virus returned just when I thought I got rid of it. And it could easily turn into a four day virus. Easily. Unless, of course, I stay in bed tonight and nurse it. Hello? SenorMatabosch? I thought it was one of your secretaries. This is Trinity Martinez. Thank you. How'’re you? I'’m ringing for Olympia, Senor. She cannot see you tonight. '’Her mother'’s coming to stay. She has the three day virus.'’ No. No. She, uh, her mother has not, uh, three day virus. Olympia has a three day virus and so she cannot see you. Her mother always stays with her because she does not like her to sleep alone, you see. Very kind of you, but her mother is already here on her way. Tell the Count I'’ll meet him at The Retreat. I'’m very sorry to hear that, senora. You should be thankful it was not more serious. Quick. I want to go on the telephone. Yes, senora.Oh, I'’m sure he will be alright. Thank you for calling. Goodbye. Matabosch is phoning The Retreat and cancelling his reservation. I'’ll wait five minutes. No. Better wait seven minutes. Comapto tried to kill himself last night. Seven minutes is long, five will be enough. His mother found him with his head in the oven. Then I'’ll telephone The Retreat, pretend to be Matabosch explain that the senor has changed his mind and wishes to restore the reservation. Very good one. One fool thinks he'’s a roast chicken. The other one'’s already talking to himself. Very good, indeed, one. Now then, Eugenio. I want you to do me a special favor. Tonight at 11 o'’clock, I want you to telephone The Retreat and ask for Matabosh, I will answer. - What do I say? - You say nothing. Whatever I say, you keep saying nothing. It'’s very important. Talk nothing-talk nothing. You understand? I'’m gonna have a cheese sandwich and a cup of your best coffee. Just a minute, already you owe me for three cheese sandwiches. Okay. You charge it to Diner'’s Club. American Express?

[laughs] This button, if you stroke it, produce enchanting music. [opera music] Don'’t you have something more with it? Ah. Louis beat, mademoiselle. But, of course. [ballroom music] Whoa! That'’s what I call ballroom music. [music stops] [music] Yeah! Oh! Hey! - That was very nice. - Yeah, yeah, very nice, indeed. I'’m afraid Louis beat is a little too energetic for me. I prefer to live without it. I suppose that'’s all. If you should enjoy your stay in our little Retreat, please tell your friends because between ourselves, we could do with a little high class trade, you know. Mademoiselle, bonsoir. Monsieur. Bonsoir. [music] I think I would like a glass of Cristal Brute. What an excellent idea. One for you, one for me. Also, I think I'’ll have a little marinated inkfish. I took the precaution of not bringing any money tonight. Oh, that'’s perfectly alright, senorita. All these accounts are sent very discreetly through the post. [pop] [chuckling] You'’re quite sure the Count'’s paying for all this? Who else has got this kind of money? What time, exactly, is he arriving? '’He'’s arriving at 9 exactly.'’ - If he'’s one minute late-- - Don'’t worry, senorita. He'’ll not be late, but listen, while your waiting for him why don'’t you prepare yourself for his arrival? What do you mean prepare myself? Oh, remove all apprehension from your mind. Practice a few greetings. "Good evening, Your Highness." "Delighted to meet you, Your Highness," or.. I know, I know what you could say, you could say "Hello, Piggy." - "Hello, Piggy?" - Yes. It'’s a practice among the nobility to have these nicknames. If you call the Count, "Piggy," you'’ll be one of the in-group. In-in-group. Let me hear that, let me hear you try that. Care for a drink, Pig? Uh, uh, pig. Pig is a little bit too intimate. Why not say, "Your Highness" once and then you can say "Piggy" for the rest of the evening. Anyway, it'’s all abandonment and pleasure. It'’s all a part of life'’s rich pageant. [crunching] Oh! - Do you always eat flowers? - Yes. I believe, you see, that if a thing is beautiful to the eye and pleasant to the smell why should it not be delicious to the taste? Hm! I like to enjoy life.. ...with all my sense. Arrr.. I'’ll drink to that. These roses are good. [music] It'’s 11 o'’clock and I'’m not waiting any longer. I'’m going home. According to my watch, senorita,it'’s.. ...15 minutes before 11. Mine is correct. But I have set my watch by the Count'’s. And it'’ll be foolish to sacrifice a large check to.. ...the difference of 15 minutes on watches. I refuse to be made a fool of by some rotten old Count that never keeps appearing. It'’s not been pleasant for me either, senorita. The entire matter has given me embarrassment and pain. Yes, I can see it'’s been very bad for your appetite. Well, I...I eat more flowers when I'’m disturbed. You couldn'’t eat more if you had another face. [phone ringing] Devil'’s machine. [male on phone] '’Hello.'’ Hello. Hello, hello. '’Is that Juan? Juan.'’ - Hello. - Eugenio. Juan? Hello, Your Majesty. [Juan] '’You have place in the most intolerable embarrassment.'’ The appointment was for 9, it'’s now nearly, nearly 11. '’What are you talking--'’ The senoritahere is not accustomed to this manner of treatment. And on her behalf, I demand your regrets. Yes. Yes. I-I-I will tell her. He wishes you to know that he was with the British Trade Commission regarding his.. ...uh, banana plantations in Ecuador. Tell him to go to hell with his bananas. Your Majesty, the senoritais too indignant to speak with you. And also, may I take this opportunity to resign my association completely. It'’s useless to plea with me, Your Majesty when my mind is made up. My mind is made up. I thank you for all your kindnesses to me and everything you'’ve done for me. Thank you, Your Majesty. And goodbye. I didn'’t like to speak so harshly to a man of nobility but.. ...he deserved it, deserved it. Let us go. Another glass of champagne. No, you'’ve had too much champagne. Am I not beautiful when I'’m drunk? To me.. ...you have the fragrance of cinnamon and cloves. People who do not have this scent, cinnamon and cloves do not know how to live. Am I also desirable? The most. Wouldn'’t it be to your advantage to encourage me to drink? Senorita, when you'’re drunk, you'’re not in full possession of your senses. And you know, it'’s no pleasure for me to have a woman who does not know what she'’s doing. Take me home. Well, alright, let'’s go. - '’No, I don'’t want to go home.'’ - Alright, well, don'’t go home. Sing a song. - How did you know I could sing? - I didn'’t know. - Then why did you ask me? - Shut up and sing. Alright. Alright, I will sing you a song. What'’s it called? I-I don'’t know what it'’s called. I improvise. How can you sing a song if you don'’t know what it'’s called? ♪ Her voice is like a soft guitar ♪ Who? ♪ The girl from Barcelona Ah! ♪ Her eyes eclipse the evening star ♪ ♪ The girl from Barcelona ♪ Sweet and true though she seems today ♪ ♪ Chances are she'’ll run away ♪ ♪ But when she'’s gone ♪ ♪ Her spell lives on ♪ No matter where you are ♪ The girl from Barcelona ♪ [music] - Good morning. - Good morning. - I'’m Carlos Matabosch. - I'’m Trinity Martinez. Oh, and these are for SenoritaSegura. Oh. [knocking] - I will put them in water. - Put them in wine. Oh, Carlos. What a surprise. I was sorry to cancel our appointment last night. Oh, I missed you very, very much. Ah, I wasn'’t feeling very well. Yeah, there is a redness in your eyes. Well, I'’ve been reading, it'’s possible I need glasses. Perhaps, you would care to recuperate in my ranch for a few days. You would be very comfortable and the warm sun will restore you. I think I would like that, Carlos. Fine. I'’ll be here at 4 o'’clock. And don'’t bother to pack anything. Come as you are. Uh, until four. Four. [doorbell rings] Good morning, princess. I'’m here to tell you that His Majesty is sick with remorse. One, I'’m finished with him. - Ah. - Finished. I don'’t wish to see or hear of him, I'’m finished. Yes, yes. Well, I quite agree with you. No matter that I told His Maje.. Uh, I told His Majesty that.. ...you know, as much as you were available on two occasions in my humble opinion you'’re entitled to the check, that is what they told him. His Majesty says to me, "Is that your humble opinion, Juan?" He calls me Juan because I'’ve known him many years. I said, "Yes, Your Majesty, for what it is worth that is my humble opinion." His Majesty then went to me, "U-u-uh,"he said. Which means, to us who know His Majesty that he is full of apologies. Whenever he goes "U-u-uh" we all say, "His Majesty is ready to apologize." And, of course, he is full of apologies. I think that his apologies should take the form of a very expensive gift. What sort of an expensive gift were you thinking of? There is a mink coat in Castillo'’s that might be purchased for the amount of the check only because it'’s late in the season. 250,000 pesetas for a coat? Oh, it probably costs much more, but we can have a look. Yes. Oh, yes. Yes, um.. You stay there while I get dressed. Certainly, no problem. I'’m not looking. Now, remember, these dealers are very shrewd. Don'’t show enthusiasm for anything. If it looks like I'’m about to spit on something it'’s because I love it. - Do you understand? - Yes, yes, yes. Come. - Quite elegant. - Hm. The washroom in the Madrid Hilton is also this big. Bonjour, mademoiselle. - In what may I serve you? - '’I don'’t know.'’ Everything this season is such trash. Uh, madameunderstands, everything is such trash. It is the embargo, but while I'’m opening the vaults perhaps madameand monsieur would care for a refreshment? I'’ll have a cheese sandwich, please. [chuckles] I'’m sorry, monsieur, tea perhaps. [bell rings] Would madamecare for one, please? No, thank you. [sniffing] And now, my collection. Now, madame,I'’m proud to present my fashions in furs. It'’s depressing, the finest salon in Barcelona and this is what is offered. Madameis so right, it is depressing. I'’m so sorry, madame. The thread, horizontally worked, natural black...mink coat. It is American. The finest. [yawning] No. There'’s one in the window. That'’s the one. It'’s a waste of time. What a waste of time. If ever I want to waste time, I will come here. Castillo'’s, the place to come in Barcelona if ever you got some time that you wanna waste. I never saw anything like it in my life. Why don'’t you shut up and eat the cakes. Leave it all to me. I'’m eating the cakes, but it'’s still a waste of time. Please forgive me for wearing the coat myself, madame. But I wouldn'’t entrust this one to any of my models. Very best tourmaline mink. Coat length, stranded with leather. Exclusive to the house of Costillo. Hmm, well, I could probably wear it on a beach. [laughing] I'’m not even sure it'’s mink, it-it appears dyed. Madame,please, this is a genuine fur. - How much is this coat? - Monsieurlikes this coat? I didn'’t say I liked it, I just said, "how much is it?" 275,000 pesetas. I'’ll be in my office while madamediscusses. - Have you got the check? - Yes, I'’ve got the check. - But then 275,000 pesetas-- - Give it to me. I just hope you know what you'’re doing here. - Monsieur. - Madame. - 250,000. - Madame, excusez. - The coat cost me 250,000. - Then you have been done. - Am I entitled to nothing? - Take it or leave it. I'’m sorry, madame, I cannot accept. - Goodbye. - I can accept. Have you got a pen? You don'’t intent to complete this purchase now, do you? Oh, why not? How does he know the check is cashable? Clearly, it is not cashable now because the banks are closed. - Will you accept it? - Do I read correctly? Martin Erimon, Count of Vilalbanal? Yes. I forsee no difficulty. I'’ll have it packed immediately. No need for a box. Gonna wear it tonight. You'’ll have it tomorrow morning. - But it is not necessary. - This is ridiculous. Even if banks were open nobody cashes a check the minute they receive it. This good man is presented with a check. We both know the check is good, but does he know? He said he'’d accept it. Why can'’t you wait until tomorrow morning? I'’ll be in the country tomorrow. He can await your return. Let'’s not be like children. In the meantime, when the banks are open this good man here can deposit the check and the transaction is finally and completely closed. - If that'’s what you desire-- - Excuse us one moment, listen.. I'’ve already told you what is to be. I don'’t want to hear anymore about it, now please. Senor,guard boththe check and the coat until tomorrow morning. - As you desire, monsieur. - That'’s what I desire. Meanwhile, I will have my tailors prepare the monogram. It'’s "OS," Olympia Segura. Plaza Del Sedona, number 12. Thank you. Bonjour, madame and monsieur. Now I must delay my trip because of your ridiculous nonsense. It is not nonsense. His Majesty is a racer of cars. What if an accident should happen between now and tomorrow? The estate would not honor the check. You and you alone with the fur in your possession would be responsible for the entire sum. Once the check is deposited, you'’re no longer liable. Hm, never thought of that. Now, there is a suggestion which you may disregard. The Count'’s plane leaves tonight at the airport at 10. On his way there, possibly there will be a chance for him to pause at your apartment for a few moments to say hello. For a fur coat, it'’s not too much to ask. Then I suggest you have available on calling one or two bottles of champagne, possibly a plate of edibles also plenty of cheese. The Count so much enjoys cheese. - Will you be with the Count? - Uh, unfortunately, no. I must concentrate on my career. Such as it is. I'’m sorry to see you leave, Juan. I'’ve very much enjoyed your company. Thank you, senorita. Juan, that song you sang to me, have you sang it to others? No, I'’ve never sung it before, I'’ll never sing it again. It is your song. [soft music] I'’ll never forget this moment, senorita.Never. Don'’t stand there like a cow in labor. Hurry, get two bottles of champagne, the best. You'’ll then wax the floors, polish the furniture clean the windows and bathe the dog. - Because the Count is coming. - Because the Count is coming. And he has already purchased for me, the finest coat in Europe. Where is it? Castillo'’s putting my initials inside it. It'’ll be ready in the morning. I'’ll not believe it until I see it. Oh, you never believe anything until you see it. Be cynical and suspicious, a typical sign of being runt. What I know of suspicion, I learnt from you, senorita. Well, learn now, that there are noble and honest people in the world and you'’ve been cruel and insulting to an innocent man who was only performing a mission that was personally distasteful to him. Of course, of course. You know, senorita, you'’ve always had a softness in your heart for unfortunates. The dog you found starving in an alley. '’To orphans, you open a wide purse.'’ '’And now, the so called matador, it would make you happy'’ '’to clean him up and dress him up with a pink ribbon'’ '’that he should trot after you.'’ Except that this one will have you on a leash before you would have him. Go for the champagne. [people chattering] Your Highness. - Now, how was that? - It'’s very good. You'’re not nervous, Olimpia? No. It'’s just curiosity. I never met royalty before. The champagne.. [doorbell buzzes] - Oh! - I'’ll get it. I'’ll get the champagne. Hello. '’You'’ll never guess what happened.'’ A cable arrived from the president of the Standard Oil Company regarding a massive pool of oil found beneath the Count'’s ranch in Mexico. You see, naturally, this necessitated His Majesty catching an earlier plane. I pleaded with him to telephone to you his regrets because I already knew of your elaborate preparations. But...you know how it is with some people. They don'’t have the courage for unpleasant tasks. Come here, Juan. Well...at least you have the fur coat. Money you expended at The Flamenco will naturally be refunded in due course. Closer. [slow music] Carbonell, the lights went out. Yeah. - Bautista, Bautista, Bautista. - Shut up, will you? [footsteps] [doorbell rings] '’What do you want?'’ Is this the residence of SenoritaSegura? Yes. '’It is urgent that I speak with her.'’ She'’s still sleeping. Who are you? I am Castillo, the furier. It is regarding the very best tourmaline mink coat length stranded with leather for SenoritaSegura. If I wake her now, she'’ll be angry. She may be angrier if you do not. Come inside. [Olimpia] '’Yes.'’ [Olimpia yawns] - Oh, good morning. - Bonjour, madame. I'’m so sorry, I was a bit late last night. Please forgive me, madame. It is some trouble with the signature. What trouble? The behavior yesterday of your...escort struck me as a little unusual. So this morning, early, I had my bank contact the bank on which the check was drawn. I was informed the Count has no account with that institution. A further investigation showed the Count does not even reside in Spain any longer. He has a ranch in Rio de Janeiro and only visits here on occasion to examine his land holdings. I'’m so sorry, madame. Ah, however, if you still desire the coat I would be glad to accept your signature without question. At an interesting reduction...220,000. If I decide to take it, I'’ll call you later. Please go now. - Two hundred thousand then. - Please. I don'’t suppose this is the right moment to say it.. ...but I told you so, never trust a gypsy. Do you think there could be others involved? Oh! Olimpia, don'’t be a little fool. You know there are no others involved. It was his own idea. Don'’t kill him, Olimpia. It'’s not worth it for a fur coat. Trinity, fill the bath with very hot water. And then pour those two bottles of blue dye into it. Make it very thick. - Why blue dye? - Don'’t argue. Do as I tell you. Why did you do this to me? I came to Barcelona, trying to get work as a singer. I am not very good in the bull ring. I can'’t keep my feet still. So I get a little work at the smaller corridas. I went to see Carbonell. I asked him for an engagement, he was not interested. I pleaded with him desperately. Eventually, he agreed... to employ me but on one condition.. ...a condition of which you are now aware of. Carbonell? That is the truth. Carbonell? Believe me, Olimpia, I...I didn'’t wanna do this. The whole affair for me has been an agonizing experience. Yes. I watched you suffer. What did he promise? He promised me...a week'’s work in his theater seven days on the stage my name outside...in green lights flashing. "Bautista. Bautista." How much pay? - Two thousand pesetas. - Two thousand pesetas a day! Two thousand pesetas for a week. Me? For 2000 pesetas. - I was desperate. - Get out of bed. - Why, what'’re you gonna do? - You'’ll soon find out. Please, look...just allow me to get my clothes and I will be gone from here. You do as I say. Yes, yes. Get into the bathroom. I'’ve already been to the bathroom. Don'’t argue. Do as I say. Yes. [water running] Now get into the bath. - I had a bath last week. - Get into the bath! - Why is the water blue? - Get into the bath. Trinity, stir the water. Oh, mind what you are doing with that brush, woman. Now, submerge your head. No, no, no, please. Please, not my head. No, Olimpia, I can'’t see anymore. It'’s enough! Now, get your things and get out. I know the penalty for stealing and beating. What is it for tinting? If he goes to the police, I still got Gamazo'’s article which doesn'’t give me the age of consent. Oh, yes, that'’s very good for you. What about me? I was not even seduced. You like blue, Juan? Green is my favorite color. However, I think if I lay in the sun for a few days, I will have it. Well, now, I'’ll just collect my clothes, and I will leave. Would you have such a thing as a bathrobe that I could borrow? Uh, this dye might go all over my suit of lights There'’s a pink one in the bedroom. [laughing] It'’s a pity he can'’t stay. Goes so well with the curtains. '’I'’d better wash out the sheets, I think.'’ You look good together. Be careful when you'’re walking at night. Yes, I'’ll put lights in the front and the back. I hope you will remember this. Yes. I shall always remember it. I shall remember it as a demonstration that in this life one gets as one deserves. Could have been much worse. Yes. But it certainly could not have been much better. Will you permit me to shake hands? Goodbye, SenorCount. Goodbye, Olimpia. [dog barking] This is a stupid question to ask but.. ...among your various products I don'’t suppose you stock such a thing as a.. ...Matador'’s Blue Dye Remover? It'’s a remover for taking the blue dye from matadors. [people yelling] - All over? - Yes, everywhere. Hey, what happened to you? Nothing happened to me. It'’s part of my new image. Juan Bautista, the singing blue matador. '’How do you like that, eh?'’ There is no doubt, you are a conversation piece. As I said to you once before, once they hear me and now see me you will plead with me to remain in your theater for two weeks at ten times the amount. Tell me, what happened up there last night, huh? What was she like? I must know all the details. SenorCarbonella...details weren'’t part of our agreement. I mean, you said to me, in front of Eugenio here, you said to me if I will remain in Olimpia'’s apartment at night with the lights out for one hour, timed by your stopwatch you would give me a week'’s engagement in your theater at 2000 pesetas. You never said to me anything about details. I'’ll tell you now.. I'’m telling you now that I want them because there are many.. ...yes, there are many who will relish the story of the singing bobo who tricked the great Olimpia. And when Matabosch hears about it he won'’t even look at her. The vicious little bitch. Senor.. Why do you hate her so much? What'’s she done to you? Never mind what she'’s done to me. Let'’s say she has made many enemies. Now, I'’m so pleased with you, I will sweeten my offer. You can have three weeks in my theater at 10,000 pesetas. Juan Bautista, the blue singing mata-troubodour or trouba-matador I know you'’ve not decided yet, who tricked the great Olimpia. Hey, wait a minute, you can put that outside my theater. Yeah, sure, "Juan Bautista, the blue singing matador who tricked the great Olimpia," huh? Flashing! Flashing! Flashing! Now, the details... of last night. Every single intimate detail. Come on. Come on. [pours drink] - You want the details? - Yes. Here they are. Olimpia...was in my arms, ready, willing, begging to be taken to the bedchamber when I paused for a glass of vintage champagne. I hadn'’t eaten all day, and one glass leads to another and soon the whole bottle was gone. I, of course, became hopelessly drunk and during this state I confessed to Olimpia my entire plan of deception. There was a terrible row during which she threw blue dye all over me. And you never did...anything? No, I didn'’t...I didn'’t do anything, no. You got near to Olimpia, and never did anything? Uh, no. Get out of my sight. Get out. Eugenio, I am going to make you a patron of the arts. - How much? - I don'’t know. I'’ll leave it up to you. It'’s purely a business transaction. I'’m leaving adequate security. You will keep my gypsy guitar until circumstances permit me to return and redeem it. Anyway, my career is only temporary delayed. It will resume again...very shortly. Meanwhile, may I take this opportunity to thank you for your kindnesses and also for the delicious cheese sandwiches. - Here, I don'’t play the guitar. - Oh! Neither do I. [crowd cheering] [whistling and hooting] El toro. [bull bellowing] El toro. [singing] "Juan Bautista, the singing blue matador." That should be very interesting. Would you care to see? No. When you see one singing blue matador you'’ve seen them all. [music]
