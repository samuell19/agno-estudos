Hello, I am Highway Patrol Inspector speaking. I am speaking to you seeing many miscalls on this phone. That's my son's phone. Where he is? Your son has met with an accident. Accident! What happened to him? Where is he, how he is? - What happened? Let me talk. - At least tell me. How did he met with accident? How he is now? We are taking him to hospital. How is my son, Doctor? Your son is very strong. Otherwise no one can survive such accidents. He will recover soon. Yeah, and who is Shruti? He keeps repeating this name all the time. If possible bring her here once. After seeing her, it's possible he will recover sooner. Don't know what's happening in the hospital for so long! I am really worried... Has something gone wrong with Obi? Hey, if anything happens to Obi... ...I shall raise havoc in Kolkata. On the very first I knew that rascal will backstab. Look, Indranath Babu is here. Let's go. Let's go. Indra Babu, how is Obi doing now? You people haven't gone back home yet? You stopped us from going to hospital. So we are waiting here to know about Obi's condition. He is fine. Doctor says the he will recover soon. Sir, we are willing to donate our blood for Obi. We just want Obi back. - Sir... ...he is not only your son, he is ours too. If our lives are needed for his sake, we are willing to to that even. Nothing will happen to Obi. As he has your prayers with him. He will soon recover and return home. Now you please leave. Go now. - Okay. Move your legs. Do you feel it? Now say. Now? Decide before going to Obi, what to say. Seeing us he will immediately ask about Shruti. I'll tell him has Shruti has left you... ...you too forget her. Have you lost your mind? Obi has somehow survived. Don't tell him anything about Shruti... If we don't tell him anything, he will beat us get us admitted here. Okay, leave it to me. I will say what has to be said. Obi, don't do this. First you be all right, then you'll see what we do. When she doesn't love you... ...then why are you troubling yourself? Forget her. How can I forget her? What should I forget? From first meeting to last, what should I forget? Every moment spent with her and everything of hers... ...how can I forget? How? And did I love her for forgetting? I warn you, if you ever again talked about forgetting her. I shall kill you all. Get lost. Go away, never show your faces again. Get out! Go! They all love you so much. They want to see their Obi, happy. And I want to see... ...that my son respects love. You bring back Shruti. I will ask your mother... ...to prepare for wedding. Your son has gone to bring the bride. Go. Welcome. - Greetings! Greetings. - Greetings. Please be seated. Bring the girl, auspicious time is lapsing. Of course. Bring Shruti. Shruti, let's go. Why are you watching? Kill him. Hey... You can't take her from here. It's my word to father that I'll come back with Shruti. And no one has enough guts to stop me. Shruti... come here. Shruti! Shruti! Don't be afraid, Shruti. Come to me. I am here, isn't it? Please come. Okay, father! Shruti! It's me, Shruti! I am your Obi! Is he mad? Yes. Yes, he is mad. - Shruti... Shruti, I am... Come, dear. 'I know how deeply Shruti loves me.' 'I don't know why she is behaving like this with me.' 'She can't live without me.' 'She entered my life like the frangrance of spring.' Biruda, have you confirmed the train she is arriving? Yes. By Darjeeling Mail. Morning 8.30. When will the train will arrive? - 8.30. At 8.30? - Yes. - Still there is half an hour. You know, this is the first time we are here to receive a girl, right? Look at Obi. Today he is so smartly dressed. Because a imported chick is coming from Kolkata. - Yeah. So why wouldn't he come well dressed? Tell me what she looks like? Neither fair nor dark. Hey, keep quiet. Age, color, fair or dark, nothing is to bothered about. Hey, will stop or should I stop you. Obi, so early at station? Is someone arriving? Which train? Darjeeling Mail. There's still time. We are here much earlier. Hey, you said it's arriving at 8.30. The trains arrives a 8.30 when it is late. It is at right time today. Should I give you good! She's coming here for the first time. Doesn't know anyone here... If I don't find her, I'll turn you guys mincemeat. Hey, there are so many girls here, how'd we know who is ours? Not ours, she's only mine. You guys are here with me. Do you have any phone number or something? No. Vinuda only asked me to escort her from the station. So, Mr. Obi, how'd we recognize her? You need not bother. I'll recognize her. You guys give me a miscall when you see a nice girl. Got it? Now move. Go, go. go. Shruti... Shruti? Shruti! - Shruti! Is there some girl Shruti here? - No. Shruti! - Shruti! - Shruti! Shruti... - Where is Shruti? Shruti! Here she is. Found her. What are you doing? Go away. Have you found her? Bro, we found one... ...but she is already an expiry dated. Okay, fine. Look for her everywhere. Tea stall, Bookstall, don't spare any place. We've looked at every place. Now I am standing before the Ladies Toilet... Listen, be posted there but don't enter in. Hey, this is ladies toilet! Go away! Hello, sir. What happened? Why holding my collor? Empty envelope within envelope, height of ignorance. Get it? - No. Check your pocket and see whether you have your purse? No. - Hmm! Your purse has entered his pocket. Now take care. Is this girl Shruti? And if not... ...then? Obi? Yes. - Shruti. Shall we? Leave my hand and I have take my bag. Oh! I will carry it. Vinuda has told me everything about you on phone. In detail? - Yes. What has he told you? Just this that a guy named Obi will come to receive you. Smart looking, friendly... ...tough. But golden hearted. That's how I could recongnize you at first glance. Actually I am this since childhood. Dad says if you aren't good, no one will love you. Vinuda, has mentioned one more thing. What more has he said? You are very decent. Oh... yeah... Come. I had decided, had I not found you, I'd not have returned home. Come on, I ran up and down so much on platform... ...l'd have reached Darjeeling. The place I was waiting, my life was at risk. Hey, why has the geography of your face has changed? You look like a monk of Ballur Math. Don't say more. Vinuda has already has given my false character certificate to Shruti. That's why I am like saint Swami Premanand. Seeing a girl, not only geography, history too changes. As it is your geography has changed. Since the day I am driving no one has taken ride in my car. So, seeing your coming... ...my heart is dancing with joy... ...that somebody will ride in my car. Come let's go. Be quick. You take the car, I'll follow. Why, there is ample place in he car? Actually, I have a bike. Bike! Then I too come on the bike. Hey! Why the bike? There is the car. I will take the bike. You heard, quietly take the luggage and go. We are coming. If there's nothing in fate, what's the use of crying! Don't you forget that you are a nice guy. Thanks, for reminding me. Obi, your speeding is increasing. Go slow. Oh. All right. Pass by. As it is I am blocked. Riding a cycle and asking for side! Guys! Let me pass. I am in hurry. What's the hurry. Are you getting married? . Go. Sir, will you give me a lift on your bicycle, please? Sorry, madam. I never give a ride to a girl. Please, I am in great difficulty. Please, change your principals. - Bye! Bye! Hey, sir! - Sitting on a mobike, why're you seeking ride on a cycle? Is it some bike? - Yes. I had completely forgotten. I feel I am going on some wheelchair. Can't you any faster? I can, but my bike has only two gears. First and fifth gear. Rest of them are disconnected. So why not in fifth gear? You hold on to me and I will take the fifth gear. Oh, God! Be careful, watch! Yeah! Hey, who is Obi? Why, do you want to thrash him? Bro, will thrash you instead. Hey! If I find him I will stab him to death. Take care of your top, front and behind. Once you're in his hands you'll find no place to hide. Hey, you scoundrel! Now say it, you pig! Where is Obi? Where is he? Hey, hey! Why are you beating him? Damn, you! I am looking for someone. Got it? I'll murder him - What has he done? He has beat up one one of our auto driver. I am union secretary. - Oh, yes? As soon as possible run from here. If you come to face him, you won't be able to even sit. Hey! You will get a beating. - Don't touch me. What did you say? Don't raise your hands and talk. Guy! Are you in tearing hurry? A bit. I have a precious thing at the back. Have to make delivery. First tell me who is Obi, and where he stays? Scrawny! Didn't you find anyone else to ask? You are asking Obi, who is Obi? Hey! I will slit her neck. - Really? Go ahead. Let's see how daring you are. I will finish her. Slash her with dagger. C'mon do it? - Don't come near. Why talk so much. Finish in one sentence. I shall finish you at once. Vinuda! - Yes. You take her home. - Come. No, I won't go. I like to watch fights. You beat them up, I shall watch. Did not I tell you, I am in hurry? You did not hear. Finish a matter in one sentence, else your head on my hands. I warned you many times... ...that you should not put your hands in fire, you won't be able to save it. But who listens! Who is it? Who got beaten up? - This guy. Despite warning why did not you listen to them? Came to fight with my son? Arrange for his treatment. - Yes. Are you new to this area? - Yes. That's why... Being subsurvient, you've got your limbs broken... ...how would you feed your family now? Have you had something to eat orjust had the beating? Eat and go. Wow! House so well decorated! This was my room first. As you were to come, dad has redone it. New bed, new freezer and AC is also new. A new TV is being brought for you. Hey, sit with your feet down. What is Vinuda? I has asked you not to do all this. It's first time you are at my home. Isn't it important to take good care of you? When you were a child I never let you off my lap. For that reason I also got lots of scolding from your father. I too haven't forgotten those days. It has remained in my memories. After your returning... ...my mother too left me alone. Don't worry. I am there for you. Mother, has prepared nice dishes for you. Come, let's test it. Come on. Obida! She's my paternal aunt. I know. I have brought her. You go. Bring a glass of water for me. Go.

My hands are not free. The meals aren't still cooked. What is it sis-in-law? He's asking for water and no one is giving it? Don't make it a habit. You'll be in trouble. In trouble? Why? - You don't know him yet. Listen, sis-in-law. I am capable of reading a man. One look and I can make out how he is. Oh, we never even understood him... ...and you've read him so soon? So should I introduce you? He is very decent. Decent? You'll realize. Here it is. Thank God! At least someone in this house is sympathetic. Shruti! Please put the fan on, it's too hot. Shruti!

You keep your mouth shut and I will give you Cadburys. Tinku! Where there is so much noise outside? Come let's go and see. Who did it! No, no. - Listen to me. Listen, what I say. No, don't. Here some murder will happen. Damn, I won't be here. - Hey, Tinku. No, nobody known to us. The one who is hit is still alive and lives the house above. It was all preplanned. If he is culprit is caught he'll be booked for attempt to murder. You guys, what were you doing? Someone just came and hit Obi and escaped... ...and you guys couldn't do anything? What were you doing? What? Come on let it be, I am fine. - No, you are not. It concerns head injury. You say, how was he to look at. Wherever he is, I will find out. I will take out my car from the garge. Where will he escape? We will sit in the car and look for him. Believe me, I did not do anything, brother. I swear on Goddes Kali. And your boys have destroyed my house and everything. I have left everything I did earlier. Believe me. Hey, don't believe him at all. He is lying. And now trying to be a gentleman. He is the one who did it. - Ok, I know who did. You go home. Hey, you go now. Greetings, sis-in-law. Don't worry at all. Obi, now what's to be done, I will do it. Hey, all of you go now. - Smile for a photograph, sir. Get lost. Is it an occasion to smile? You don't look at the situation, here something tragic has happened... ...everyone is sad faced. Now take the photograph. And write that local legislator Prakash Rai... ...was present at the place of accident. Also that he expressed to Obi who's hurt and his mother... ...his sympathies. Make sure to write that. What I have said that only... Mr. Prakash, let it be. - Why are you saying so... ...such a tragic incident has take place... ...and will I let it go just like this? It could be a Maoist incident too. I am going to raise this issue in the assembly. Bring the person who has hit me. I will break bone and parcel it. You know what I will do? As long as don't find out that person... ...l'll not wear the shirt till then. - Why are you guys shouting so much? What, what are you saying? Do you have any idea? If something more had happened, what would have happened... Such a large stone was brought to him. Because he could not throw the big one he threw smaller one. It's just a minor attempt, later it will be his life. We will kill him. No, no. Whoever you have doubt for throwing the stone... - Ok, ok. ...arrest everyone of them. Arrest everyone of them. You leave, we will take care of everything. Sis-in-law! As Vinuda, not to register complain at the police station. What Vinuda is going to do, I am not concerned, but I will do something. How dare he, that he came to the house and hit my son! You go. Get freshen up, and come with me to the temple. Why? - I've taken a vow for Obi. Just for such a minor matter, you have take vow too? Why not? It's a matter of head injury, if something goes wrong then? Come, Shruti, come. Are you jittery seeing all this? It's always like this. Once I had fever... ...Dr. was late just for 12 minutes and the declared strike for 12 hours. He will be found. Where will he run injuring me. Once he comes in my hands, I will thrash him good. Obi. I want to talk to you something. Alone. What's it, Shruti? Ask them not to go to police. And there is no need to look for who has hit you. Hey. shouldn't he be taught a lesson, who attacked me? This apart, don't you also like seeing fights. It's fine watching but not being in it. Meaning? I am the culprit. - What? I did not do it deliberately. Actually, I waned to break the bulb of your house. Instead your head came before it. Sorry. Then fine. To tell you the truth... ...there was no hurt in this injury. But the seven days you did not talk to me... ...that was much hurting. Do you know, I could not even eat properly all these days. Couldn't even sleep properly. Shruti, don't you love me at all? Are you in love with someone else? Forget about loving someone... ...if I want to even die, I can't do it as per my wish. You don't know my father. My life, death, everything will be as per my father's wishes. But your case is different. Because you have such a good parents. Everyone here loves you so much. They are even willing to give their lives for you. Just because you are injured so slightly... ...they all have come running to you. And if I am lying on death bed... ...my father wouldn't even know. These few days... ...you have made me forget my sorrows. You are a very good friend of mine. Add from previous last. To love you... ...is not in my fate. With this misfortune of mine... ...don't try to associated, Obi. Hello! Hi. Is my ticket confirmed? What's your name? - Shruti Roy. Just give me a minute. Kolkata, Wednesday, 3.25 pm. Thank you. - Welcome. Shruti. Tinky said the you wanted to talking to me? Obi. What happened the other day... ...after that... Shruti, you're still with the same topic? I know, you didn't hurt me deliberately. No, no. Not about that. Oh, so is it about your father? Because I know, whatever you said was in anxiety. I am not bothered about it. And you too don't worry about it. - Holu! I am unable to explain now... - Holuda! Holu! I know you deeply love me. And that's my greatest fear. For the better of both of us... ...I am leaving from here tomorrow. But, I... Debu! - I want to live. What's the matter, Debu? Who's this girl? Holu, lives in Padakata, and I love her a lot. So why you want to commit suicide? Actually, her brother is a don of this area. And fearing him, she couldn't take my name. Her brother will never agree to our affair. It is quiet possible the may kill me. Love is not in my fate. Get up. Don't talk like a fool. Fate cannot be changed with suicide. To change one's fate one has to try himself. Listen. Your life is yours. You can mould it as you wish. It's you who will decide who you will love or not, not your brother. Listen to your conscience and do accordingly. Don't do something being afraid that you repent later in life. Destroying self cannot make for keeping love alive. One has to hold someone's hand with trust. Debu, take her with you. I will talk to her brother. Go. Come. They act foolishly. Yeah, you were saying something? I too am also going to act foolishly. But I am sure... ...that the open who comes to the aid of everyone... ...he will also gladly give life for my sake. I won't say anything more. My heart's ringtone. Is now ringing of my love. My heart's ringtone is ringing of my love. My heart says, Hello, Hello, Hi, Hi. Open the doors of my life ring the bell and come in. Heart says, Hello, Hello, Hi, Hi.

No one has ever been happy suppressing her wishes. Do what your heart says. And I have done the same. I am very happy today. I feel like a free bird. - Wait a minute. Don't do it because I said it. Will you be get rid of the fear with which you lived so long? Listen to your heart. Whatever it says, do that. I will, if my heart is with me? That is fixed deposited in Obi's heart. And once it's deposited... ...it's locked for lifelong. It can't be removed. - Hey, why would one withdraw? On maturity the return will be with interest... Hey, if you open your mouth so wide flies will get into it. Does mouth want to shut? Because stomach demands feeding. - Be ware, boss! Hey, this is... - Ok, all right. Tomorrow's lunch is on me. Hey, eat easy, it seems you guys got to eat after 7 births. Whatever you wish to understand, you may. Shruti, repeat the order. No, it's enough, enough. Guy, whatever is on the table, bring it once more. Hey, first finish what's on table, then you can have more. It will be over in no time. That's why your faces are so puffed up. Don't disturb while eating. Really! Shruti? Hey, Shruti! Isn't it enjoyable? - Hey, Shruti! Shruti! Hey, Shruti! - Who? Hey, she is my friend. We were studying together. Shruti! Hey, Shruti! Shruti! - The dish is so nice. - Shruti! Perhaps she is calling you. Shruti! No, not me. Someone else may be. But she is waving at you. Shruti! Shruti! - Wow! You are acting as if are West Bengal's heroine Katrina. Shruti... Let's go. - whoever sees you waves at you! Come let's go to her. No Master. She is waving at you. Don't know how many and where all you have your followers. Hey, Shruti, I called you so many times, don't you hear me? I cannot even imagine I will meet you here. When did you come here? I came yesterday. Her sister's home is... Oh, he's my husband, Amit. How are you? Sorry! Who are you? Now again you are up to your old games? She is always like that. She puts you in such an awkward position... There was no girl in our batch... ...who she did not harass like this. Hey? I think you are making some mistake. I really don't recon you. Shruti, now you will get a beating. Come, sit with us and let's have a chat. Did not I tell you I don't know you. Why are you forcing me? Go away, don't disturb me. Shruti, I am Sujata. Don't you have anything in your head? Since when I am telling you that I don't know you... ...even than you don't understand. Why are you behaving like this with me? What... What's wrong with you? Are you afraid of talking to me before these guys? Why would I be afraid? They all are my friends. And I have neither seen your nor do I recongnize your. Perhaps you are mistaken somehow. Impossible. Shruti, was my best friend in the college. We studied together for three years. And I won't recongnize my friend? Sujata. If she is not able to really recongnize your... ...then don't bother. There is no need to talk to her. Let's go. - Amit! Shruti, you did not act right. Insulted me before everyone. Come. Come on. Sit. Hey, why have you stopped. Continue eating, please. Had something gone wrong between you two? But it did not appear that she was lying. Oh! So you too aren't believing me? Shruti! Shruti! Welcome, madam. Is your anger subsided or you are still with it. Sorry. Due to me your enjoyment was hampered. Instead of shouting at her you could have nicely replied to that girl. I could not control my temper. I am with such kind of pain since long time. What pain? What kind of pain? - My father. Everyone is scared from the name of Amit De Roy, in Kolkata. Murdering someone, thrashing and mauling someone... ...it's nothing to him. He has no value for any human life. Seeing all this since childhood... ...I devolped a hatred. Only what I like was my mother. My mother loved me a lot. Papa, also troubled my mother a lot. I may not be troubled... ...so, my mother kept an artificial smiling face. One day, me and my mother were returning from the temple... ...and I was naughtily plying with mother... ...and my mother was tolerating everything smilingly. Then suddenly a truck appeared... ...and smashed our car. I had a head injury. I had to be hospatilized for a month. And when I returned, I found... ...the on the spot... ...due to accident... ...my past 3 year's memory was lost. I am unable to recall anything. And those three years are not leaving in peace. And there, people come and ask me to remember them. ...and they say who are they? Hearing all that and trying to remember, my mind used to blast. ...I came here to Kolkata. And here too I have no peace. The same good old question. It was better if I had died with mother. Sorry, Shruti. I did not know it. You will get well. You will certainly get well. All the reports are here? But what's the use of all this? Many doctors have examined me in Kolkata and treatment is also on. Do it for myself, show to the doctor. Come. Come in. Hey, Obi, welcome. I was just thinking about you. How are you? Shruti. Am I right? You're thinking how do I know you? This Obi, kept talking about you yesterday night. And when did he put down the phone, do you know? Morning 3. And in every sentence he must have taken your name at least 4 times. Shruti, Shruti, Shruti, Shruti... He did not let me sleep. But hearing about you yesterday, I felt he is in a lot of tension. Anyway, have you brought Medical Reports. - Yes. Good. Sit down. - Come. There appears to be nothing critical. Very simple case. You continue with the prescribed medicine, you will be fine. Kolkota doctors too say the same, that I will be fine. But I haven't recovered. Look, forgetting is human nature. You have it in your throat but can't say it. Reason? Those words have slipped your memory. Suppose someone hit someone from behind. The one who got hurt he cried out! But for a second he could not remember anything. Because, for a moment his memory was lost. But this memory loss... ...could not be only for a few moments... Perhaps, it is for few hours... ...or even for months or even for few years. It's called post traumatic event amnesia. Shruti, has the same condition. Many years from her life are washed out. No, no. Trying to remember will recover the memory. Will she be fine like before? Recover she will, but... She will be totally fine or not, it can't be said. I did not get it? Suppose, Shruti get her lost 3 years' memory... ...then she will lose the memory of her present. Her coming here, the people from here... ...whatever has transpired during this time, she will forget. So much so... ...she will forget you too. Why are you crying, Shruti. Doctor said you will be fine. I don't want to recover, Obi. If doctor has said I will never recover... ...then it would not have affected me at all. If he said I will be dead... ...then I would not have bothered. But he has said something totally unacceptable, obi. That I may forget you. I cannot bear this at all. Not in any condition. Ok, Obi. If doctor's prediction comes true... ...will you leave my side, will you? If I am rally unable to recognize you... ...and tell you that I don't recongnize you... ...and ask you to go away from my eyes... ...even then you will not leave me, will you? I don't want to recover. I don't want to be all right. I can't live without you. Shruti, why are you living a feared life? All this time you lived under the fear of your father... ...and now you want to live under the fear of doctor's say so. Whatever happens around you, you are afraid of it. Why, Shruti? Why? Don't you trust that I will be with you all your life? Shruti, when first time I saw you at the Railway Station... ...that very day my heart said that you are the only one for me. And you will be mine till the last breathe. Nobody can take you away from me. Hey, leaving everything else are you driving? Be quick. What else should I do? What? The car only comes out once every six months. I am practicing driving so that I may not forget driving. What I am doing, huh! Obi, are you listening, I am Shruti speaking. Obi, are you listening, I am Shruti speaking. Obi, are you listening, I am Shruti speaking. Obi, are you listening, I am Shruti speaking. Obi, are you listening, I am Shruti speaking. Yes. Ok, fine I will be there. Obi, who called? Your aunt. Mother. Will you have tea? I want to tell you something. My cooking isn't done yet, go and talk to your father. It can't be told to father, Mother. I am making fish curry, will you eat? I will see about it in the afternoon. What I am saying now first listen to it. What will you have now, fried flat bread or the puffed one. Look. I want to talk something important and you're talking about others things. Okay, tell me what it is? Mother. I am in love. You are in love! Hey, what happens, bring the dough quickly. Mother. Mother, you... - Hey, be careful, it will fall. Mother I am telling you something... Hey, why don't you tell me, I have nothing to do. If nothing to do then go and do something. Hey, listen, listen... - Yeah, go ahead. Go give this tea to his father. Now, go get to work. All right. 'All right! '. Mother listen. She is very good. Learned, knows to cook and also very beautiful. Exactly like you wished. Oh, is it so? Tell me who's she? Shruti. Oh, the same fair girl? The one at Binoy Roy's home? Hey, is sugar right in your tea? Have I mistakenly told somebody else's name instead of Shruti? Or am unable to explain? No reaction. Hey, brother's tea you are having? Because beetle leaves are in his mouth. Mother, I'm talking to you about such an important matter... ...and your not giving any heed to it? I know. You love Shruti and Shruti loves you. - Mother. That's the end of the matter. Aunty. Fish curry and mutton, is very testy. Hey, when did you guys come? - Very early morning. We came to narrate your love story to aunt. So aunt did not let leave without it. Gosh, if the trailor has such that then what will full movie have! Narrating your love story would entail treats for a month. Isn't it? - Hold on, I am gonna give you a treat. Hey, what are you doing? - Stop! Look, those boys' naughtyness. Reading morning newspapers to bring headaches. What will become of this nation? - How are yo. Look, the same news again. Hey, Indranath Babu you! Today your walking style has changed completely? Because there is good news. What? Obi is in love. Really? - Yeah! Hey, Debu! - Yes, sir. It's your responsibility to arrange everything for Obi's marriage. Obi's wedding? Don't you know? Obi, is in love. With whom? The girl who is at Vinu's home with her. Listen, you will supply everything needed for Obi's wedding. All right, sir. - And you... ...all the flower arrangements will go from your shop. Want to go to that shop or this? - This one. Okay, in that? Okay, let's go. Give me some green chiles. - Hey... Look, the girl there is... ...will be the wife of our Obi. Oh yeah? Really, she is very beautiful looking. Hey, miss! Will you come here? Come on, come. Please come. Give your bag. Please. - Give me. Fill it up, fill it up. Here take it. So much? Hey, don't give me so much, I haven't the money. Who is asking for money? You the future daughter-in-law of our elder brother. So it's our blessing it advance. May God lavish with everything, daughter. Our Obi's bride is so very beautiful. Both of you will make a handsome couple. Listen, I too would made beautiful couple... ...just because my nose is bit flat that's why... ...Obi never look at me seriously. Now don't poke your nose here. What's your comparison between you and Obi's to be bride? Now let it be, we don't want to talk about is much in the market. Let it be, you need not say anything. Keep an eye on Obi. I will. Let's go. - Now weight my vegetables. Chiles... Hey, sister! Sir had come to the market, he has advanced everyone. What advance? Hey, advances for your wedding arrangements. Sister, you will see my dash on your wedding day. Will put on a shirt that day? How can I, I have taken vow. As long as I don't thrash the guy who hit Obi... I will not be able to wear the shirt. On the day of wedding you will know, who hit him. Let's go. What did she say? Are you really marrying Obida? I thought I would make passes at you... You are such a naughty kid I did not know? I will not spare you today, hold on. Hey, stop! Where are you going? Can't you see your way? Why are you staring, I know I am beautiful. Are the Phoolwadi's guys are after me just for nothing? It's quality, boss. Oh, is that so? - Yeah. You are getting to hyper about all this. What you don't understand don't talk about it. I don't want that something goes wrong here. Shruti! Don't worry. What's it Vinuda! You better pack your stuff, I will drop you home. Did my father call? No. Then? When I was working for your father... ...there was not a day when I did not see a murder. I was suffocated seeing blood and bodies. So a ran and came back here. I won't like to see the same blood and gore again. You leave from here. No. I will not go. I beg you. - Vinuda. Have you lost you mind. Your begging to such a young kid? - You keep quiet. I have brought you up since childhood... ...your happiness is my happiness. So why are you asking me to leave? Don't you wish that I love Obi? If you were my daughter... ...then I would have said... ...that I must have prayed hard... ...so I got someone like you. But your are Agnidev Roy's daughter. If you leave from here... ...it will be better for you and Obi as well. I beg you with folded hands... You leave! You forget what he said. He's unnecessarily scaring you. You love Obi, yeah? Sis-in-law! You won't go back, due to your father's fear? Obi really loves your so much. Don't deceive him. Oh, wow! Is it my room? Who's in the bathroom? Me. Doomed! Why are you in my bathroom? Why, can't I? No, no. Of course you can. As you will be staying here, bedroom, bathroom everything is yours. Have you made up this room? Yeah. As I have to stay here, I've made it worth living for human being. Why, don't human beings stay here? No. How do you feel? Excellent. Not the room. Me? If you ask such a question I won't be able to control myself. I would make mistake. What? Make mistake? Hey, Shruti! What are you up to? Then, let's commit mistake. You are saying, as if your are offering tea or coffee. Hey. Just tell me whether you'll commit mistake or not? Hey, don't joke about it. Okay? Who is joking with you? Hey, stop, stop, stop! This is the border line. You won't cross this and I will not... cross... You talk too much. Shruti, Shruti... - You should be... Shruti, I will shout now... Oh! Then go ahead! One... Two... Three... What happened, Shruti? Shruti... Why are you crying? Will you tell me what it is? Everything will be destroyed, Obi. Doctor says, I will forget you. Vinuda, is asking me to leave and go. I am scared, Obi. Don't you trust me? I don't even trust myself. It will be better if I really forget you. So... Shruti... I want a child form you. What nonsense is this? Will everything be fine after a child? What doctors say, that always is not right. My only truth is that you love me and I love you. Shruti, trusting me you are willing to surrender everything... ...so how can I leave you alone, tell me? Shruti, even if you forget me, won't recognize and shoo me away... ...even then I won't forget you. Have faith. I have complete faith in you. But my father... Thinking about him itself gives me jitters. What fear, Shruti? Fear of what? Here, talk to your father. I will talk to him. Call him. I don't know anything, sir. Please let me off. Boss. Younger sister's call. Give him good treatment. Your time will pass well. Hello dear, Shruti. How are you? Not Shruti, I am Obi here. Vinuda's neighbour. Speak. How is Shruti? - She is fine. I want to talk something important to you. Yes, speak. I and Shruti love each other. Tomorrow I am coming to Kolkata to talk to you. No. You need not come here. I am coming there. We'll talk face to face. Swine! Sir, may I go? Hey, have you seen Obi? - No I haven't. Hey, Where is Obi? - I don't know. Obi! Hey, Vinu, what happened? Is Obi at home? I have something important. Why, what's it? Obi, called Shruti's father last evening. He has come here. - Yes, I know. Obi has gone to meet him to Siliguri. What's wrong with you mind... ...that you are going to meet with Agnida? This guy is very dangerous. I called my cousin in Kolkat and came to know... ...that he is a big mafia. Whenever he wishes he spreads bodies. Do you see guys following on the bike behind? They aren't locals. Yes, they are following us since long. Obi, let's go back and ask Shruti's father to come your home. Who is Obi? I am. Come. You come alone. Boss, he's here. Hi! Hello, I am dada speaking. Yes, dada? I sent Shruti to your place so that she feels better. But I did not know she will be so much better. No, no... dada, it's nothing like that. You have forgotten old days, haven't you? Why are you saying that? Whatever I am today, it's all give by you. I have not mercy and sympathy, Vinu. I nursed a street dog. That was my biggest fault. Kindly forgive me, sir. I did not know anything about it. Ask Shruti be ready. The flight is at 3.30. I am going to fetch her. So then? You went round about and said what you wanted to. Now it's my turn. I will say it in one sentence. Shruti will take a flight at 3.30 or bid your goodbye... ...it will be decided by her to be hubby. Not her father. Boss, should I finish him? No. When I go in the flight with Shruti... ...after that. Vinu! Hello, sir. Please come. Come in. Hey, I see you have changed your house completely. No, sir. I am the same as I was with you. Oh yes? Greetings, sir. How are you Sheela? - Fine. Are you fine? - Yeah. Where is Shruti? Getting ready. Father, I am going to play cricket. May I go? What grade? Plus one. How's your studies going. I stand 2nd in the class. Wow! Very good! Very Good! Here, buy some chocolate. And how is your business going? With your blessing it's doing fine. Only being busy in your work will work? Got a family, take care of them too. ...they will be on the street. Let's go. Live happily. Her mother talked about you a lot. She also wanted to come here and see you. But in that accident... No one can say when death calls. No one knows. Let it be, come to Kolkata with uour family. Yes, I will. Come. - Father. May I go and meet my friends once? Go. Or you'll feel bad. Chewing beetle leaves of the Phoolwadi... Hey! Listen. What is it? - Give me. What will you do with it? Chew, what more? It's laced with tobacco, that too very powerful. You will get such a kick that you will be flat. The kick I've got, what could be more than that? Go. Shruti, you haven't left yet? Go, go. You will be late. What's it, Obi? My father has come to take me, I am going. Won't you say anything? Go carefully. Why don't you understand? Once I am gone, I won't be come back again. You don't know my father, once he decides he does that. And your father does not know me. Once I decide something... ...I do the same. Do you trust me? I promise, if your father does not let you off... ...then I will kidnap you. Go, he is waiting for you. Move to airport, quick. Stop, stop. Who is he? Obi's father. Hello. Your good, aren't you? Having stopped the car in the middle of the street, to show affection? Your daughter is my to be daughter-in-law. It won't look nice if you left without meeting. If you aren't in hurry, let's finalize everything now. What finalization, What talks? About their wedding. They love each other a lot. As it is I have already accepted you daughter as my daughter-in-law. So you will decide where my daughter will marry or not? You are aged so I will spare you. Otherwise I would have shredded you here and here only. Of course I am aged... ...yet my heat is leaping with happiness. And you, despite being younger, are so hotheaded? I am still cool. But once again if you talked about my daughters' wedding... ...then I will bury you and your son here itself. Merely holding my collar has brought so many people... ...luckily it did not tear. Sir, don't show off here. This place is maternity home of goons. Everyday it gives birth to a few goons and supply to Kolkata. Give way, give way. What has happened. Why is the crowd? Isn't father talking to him? - Obi! That man held uncle's collar. I will cut his hand and throw away. Obi. Ask them to leave. Come on, let's go. Come guys, move. Leave. Come go, everyone leave. Come go, away. Move. Go all of you. Alliances are not decided on the street. You go to Vinu's home... ...and I will come with my wife to bless your daughter. Boss. What will you say, rascal? Here the folks respect Mr. Indernath, a lot. As long as wedding does not take place... ...you and Shruti won't be able to leave here. Swine! Just one hour... Within an hour I will show who am I. Boss, have you taken the flight? Don't ask anything Just listen what I've to say. I am held in this house. What's my standing I will let everyone here. As many men you can collect from Kolkata, bring them here. Nobody from here should be left alive. By tomorrow I should see this place as crematorium. Don't you bother, boss. By tomorrow morning Phoolwadi would vanish from the map. What will you have for dinner? Hello, Bugga? Hey, what happened, why did not you call? These guys are very dangerous. Yesterday night I called for two coaches full of men. But none of them is in one piece now. Get lost! At the station itself people came started to beat them up. Had no opportunity even to take out anything from the bags. They beat up, and applied salt and pepper on tht wounds. They all are in agony. We have beaten up so many people in life... ...but we haven't been beaten up like this. Hardly a few have gained consciousness. They thoroughly beat us up and admitted in hospital. And have said, they will bear the cost of hospital. May I come in, sir? Come, come. Keep it here. Here. Sir, these stuff belongs to your men. Take care of them, sir. Can we leave now, sir? We have to go to hospital and then go home. Just to enquire about your men there. Good bye, sir. - Good bye. Come let's go. When will be the engagement? Actually... Please remain seated. Greetings, bride's father, sir. Don't take anything to mind. What was to happen that's over. What's one's standing is... ...this is not the time to show that now. Please come. Let's bless them. You can talk. You happened to be the father of he boy... ...who else will talk but you? Had my daughter was on my side today... ...then the situation would have been quiet different. It's natural for you to be angry. But if a daughter grows up and take her own decision... ...it certainly makes a father feel bad about it. Every fathers wishes for her daughter to marry in a good house. But we too aren't some small fries. I have not daughter. Your daughter is my daughter. Sheela. Come, dear. You wanted your daughter's alliance in some good home... ...then why not ours? I promise you... ...I will keep her so happy that you could not have even imagined. Despite all this, if I take my daughter away... ...then she certainly will come back. As she has already decided... ...then I won't say anything. After everything is over... ...I will return. You can say from right now that Obi is in your hand. Even when I am not with you... ...this ring will remind your of me. Come let's again do the same mistake. You only get one chance, had not I told you earlier? Hey, Shruti, Shruti! Play trumpets and play the drums. On this happy occasion, heart is dancing with delight. Play trumpets and play the drums. On the this happy day, heart is dancing with delight. The atmosphere is electric, we are out to celebrate. Heart, heart, heart is full of happiness, it's going crazy. Heart, heart, heart is full of happiness, it's going crazy. With just a touch of love, heart wants to be lost. And it is swaying with rhythm. With just a touch of love, heart wants to be lost. And it is swaying with rhythm. If your deceptive mind can guess, better guess now. My heart and mind is inebriated with your love. Heart, heart, heart is full of happiness, it's going crazy. Heart, heart, heart is full of happiness, it's going crazy. In the space of happiness, my heart is dancing with your love. In the space of happiness, my heart is dancing with your love. You are aware of hidden signals of eyes. The burning heart is soothed with your sweet talks. Play trumpets and play the drums. On this happy occasion, heart is dancing with delight. The atmosphere is electric, we are out to celebrate. Heart, heart, heart is full of happiness, it's going crazy. Heart, heart, heart is full of happiness, it's going crazy. Heart, heart, heart is full of happiness, it's going crazy. Heart, heart, heart is full of happiness, it's going crazy. Heart, heart, heart is full of happiness, it's going crazy. What happened? Vinu what's happening? Hey! Obi! Welcome, welcome. Shruti is in the car. For two days you held me in the house and treated me so well. Had I left without repaying, I would have felt so sad. Hey, go. Now go and be hospitable to them. Go! Obi! Obi... Obi! 'Shruti was afraid that she will forget me.' 'But I gave her my word... ...that despite that I will not leave her and go.' 'I will keep my word.' 'Come what may, I will not leave you.' No! Rascal! Obi, escaped and you are showing your teeth? Before he leaves this area get hold of him and kill him. Go! Get going! Unnecessarily you are taking tension. The story of North Bengal your daughter does not remember. Not even the boy. The boy will roam around in the streets and go back home. Once a man comes to the gates of death he does not return. My tension is that. Everything will be fine. - Okay, sir. Good bye. - Good bye. Hello, Obi, speak. Doctor. Shruti is unable to recognize me. Oh God! It means she has recovered. It means, she got her lost memory and forgotten about you. And the worst part is, Obi... ...that she may recall you or may not. It's all in the God's hands. You tell me. Dear, go and bow in the Narayan's Temple. Father? Yes, dear, go. Sujata? Hey, Sujata! Hi! Let's go. Other day she insulted me... ...and now wants to talk to me. - Hey, hold on. Hey, you're going away despite seeing me? Have pride taken you over? You son has grown up a lot. I will go a bit further. I had seen when he was so small. Even with you I am meeting after a long time. Tell me how are you? Now pretend, you don't even recognize when you see me. What nonsense? Don't you remember how badly you insulted me in Siliguri. In Suliguri and me? Oh, I see. So I have to remind you? In front of everyone you shouted and said... ...that you don't recognize me. Your behaviuour that day made me cry. You don't every talk to me again. Sujata! God! When did I go to Siliguri? Shruti. Don't be afraid. I just want to talk to you something. Hey, Shruti. Shruti! Spoiled my mood in the temple. - Listen. Are you able to recogniz me? You look familiar. Tell me where have I seen you? In Siliguri's restaurant. With Shruti. Yeah. I want to talk to you. Just five minutes. All her talks still echoes in my mind. 'Don't ever leave me, Obi.' 'I won't be able to live without you, Obi.' But unfortunately she can remember anything now. I am very saddened for her. But I am most sad about you. When she refused to recognize me in Siliguri... ...I was very agitated. Because we are very good friends. But... You were to be married, isn't it? My parents, friends... ...even the folk from Phoolwaid do not that Shruit's lost her memory. If they know, they will be highly pained. We will help you. But if Shruti's father comes to know... ...he will not spare us. Don't worry about that. I shall not let anything happen to you. I shall take care of her father. You may take care of her father... ...but how would you make Shruti understand? I am confident that I will be able to make her understand. You just make Shruti meet me once. All right. To say sorry to her for today's incident I'll call her somewhere. Hey, Shruti. Hi! Hi! Sit. Thanks. Thanks for what? Despite my other day's behaviour, your coming here. The anger I had on you... ...I felt like breaking your nose. We met after so such a long time... ...and she turned her face and walked. What you did to me, I did the same. What did I do to you? In Siliguiri you did not want to even recognize me. What are you saying? When did I go to Siliguri? You mean I am lying? Ask Amit. Okay, I went to Siliguri and insulted you. Settled? Your ring is so beautiful! Who gave you? I don't know. I am unable to recall. - 'Obi, listen, I'm Shruti speaking.' 'Obi, listen, I'm Shruti speaking.' 'Obi, listen, I'm Shruti speaking.' 'Obi, listen, I'm Shruti speaking.' - Hey, the voice is just like mine. Not like yours, it's your voice. Your voice was recorded and made it a ringtone. What do you mean? Who will record my voice? The one who loves you. The one who gave you this ring. That's me. The ring on your finger... ...Obi. Aren't you the same... ...who came to my house and had an scrap? What do you want? I am just to remind you here. I don't know you, reocgnize you. And there's no need to remind any further, okay? Shruti. Shruti. Stop! - Shruti! Don't go. Let them settle their own matter. - Shruti! Shruti! Shruti, you know me, recognize me and also loved me. Despite knowing nothing about me you've come so far. If my father come to know about it... Your father too knows that you love me. But he hasn't accepted our relationship. He has dragged you away from me. Shruti! Shruti... - What's the matter, man? Why are you disturbing her? I'm telling you in one sentence. She is angry and I am trying to make her understand. Do not disturb. Or else, I will make a full stop. Just minute. Three certain things. I won't take much time. You can trust me on it. Please, Shruti. Shruti! Shruti! Hey, Shruti! You should be careful. Here take this. Why are you acting funny? Please go away. How can I go, tell me? I did not love you to leave you and go. Believe me. I don't remember having seen or known you ever. I know. That's why I am here. Try to remember, you had been to Siliguri. To Vinuda's home. I had gone to receive your at the station. We also had to been to Swamji. After having seen you he had that you will be my wife. Shruti... - What you are saying possible that's true... ...your love can also be true... ...but I am not that girl. I am somebody else. You are not somebody else, Shruti. You are the same Shruti, you are my love. Shruti! Shruti! Shruti! Oh, It's you. Shruti! Shruti! Shruti... Hey, what happened? What happened? Will you guys help me?

I won't come back again. When he is all right ask him to go home. Okay, I will see to it. Why are you staring like this? Have you found out how Obi is? It's not easy to play the game of love, Shruti. Despite being beaten up so many times... ...he lying here just for your sake. He does not even know whether he'll die or survive. He only know that he cannot leave you and go. Shruti, he is nothing to me and I don't even know him. But I am able to trust him but you... And you are not able to have trust in him? In Siliguri you were not able to recognize me. And look... ...now you don't remember anything about it. It's not something very old. Just a few days back. At least try to remember it once, Shruti. Where you had been to, with whom your met. Shruti! Yes, father. Is it over? - Yes. Then come. - Okay. Is there any news of Obi? No. Then call him up. 'Obi, listen, I am Shruti speaking.' 'Obi, listen, I am Shruti speaking.'

Hold on, your mother will talk. Hell, Obi! - Hi, mother. When are you coming back home with Shruti? I am returning today, mother. Inform everyone that I am returning with the Phollwadi's daughter-in-law. Because your Shruti's father that's why I did not say anything. But after this if everyone come between me and her... ...then telling you in one sentence. Not only father... ...even if father's father comes, I will bury him here and now. You won't even able to say what things son-in-law sent to you. Come Shruti. Why are you after me? Go away. Shruti, please come. - Please go! Sorry, Shruti. Shruti! Shruti! Shruti! Shruti! Shruti!

Come, Shruti! Come. Come. Welcome back, dear. We were waiting for your arrival. Come. It's blessing of Goddess that you are together. And no one can change that. Go, take her inside. Yes, father. This way. - When you left leaving brother Obi... ...we were highly pained. Did not I ask you to take care of, Obi? Why did you go? After this if you leave him agian even for a day... I will never talk to you. Agreed that you were held, but couldn't you run and come? It's not merely love but one must respect it too. Uncle, stopped me... ...or I would've come to Kolkata, begged you and brought you here. Then we would have seen what your father could do. Without you the entire neighbourhood too looked so barren. Now you are here. we are relieved. Now you will see that we will celebrate for month. Shruti, promise you will not go back again leaving us. Sister, now my car will be able to come out. The better end makes everything better. Come. Mother. - Welcome, dear. Entire night I kept awake waiting for your arrival. My Obi is alive just because of your love. Go, son. Take her inside. Go. Come. Come on, come. Hold on. Speak. Local SP has informed me about you. You are a respects citizen of this area. But he has complained to us that... ...your son has kidnapped his daughter. So keeping your respect in mind I am requesting you... ...that without any protest return his daughter to him. Had I wanted to something, I'd have dragged him and brought to Kolkota. He too sent his man and murdered... ...one of my man and ran away with his daughter. His daughter love my son. On her own accord she has come here with my son. All right. Call her we would like to hear from her own mouth. - All right. I will ask before everyone present. And if she agrees to go back on her own... ...then you can take her. But if you try forcing her... ...the I am warning you... ...nobody will be able to return from here. Come! Come. Look, Shruti, take a look. This is the very room which you decorated with your own hands. You had said if you have to stay here... ...so make it worth living for human beings. Look. Everything is the same. Look. Are you able to recall? Aren't you able to recall? Shruti... ...look at this. This sari, the jwelery... ...everything is brought by you. You said, you are going to be Phooliwadi's daughter, boss. Won't I have to be dressed up like the one. Shruti, can't you remember anything? You bought a suite for my father, a sari for the mother... ...and said that they were your father now on. And as I am marrying, everyone has to be well dressed. Can't your remember? Shruti. Shruti, look at this. Look, look at this. This is the very place where you asked for a child. And you said even if you forget me... ...my child will remind you everything. Shruti... can't your remember anything of it? Try to remember please. What are you saying? - Yes, uncle.

Tell them that you are not going back, please. Will you take her back? Try doing that! I will slit your throat. What's he use yelling at him. Tell the one who has forgotten. You might have forgotten everything... ...but could you forget the time spent here with Obi? You can forget everything... ...but a person who you loved so much... ...how can you ever forget that. Till death it will be with you. Indranth Babau! What about your word... ...the if Shruti wants to go on her own wish, you will let her. Ask your son to let off. Keep quiet! You all keep quiet. Shruti will go or stay it will be decided by her. Take your daughter with you. If she is willing to go on her own, then take her. Shruti, my child. You don't need to be afraid of anyone. I am with you. Speak up, dear. Did not you ever love my son? No. Are you saying under someone's pressure? I am telling you, I am there for you. You never loved him? Go then. Go away from here. I've just one request. Before going kill my son and go. End his life with your own hands. Shruti! Come here. No, no. You don't take her away. Please don't take her. - Shruti! Shruti! Please don't go, Shruti! Please. Let off my hand. Why are you saying this? It's not some game that if you ask to leave and I will. I know how deeply you love me. Shruti, you love me more than I love you. Were not you the one who told me even if your father kills you... ...even then I should not leave you. Even if you forget, I should remind you. And today you are asking me to leave you. I won't be able to do that. I will die but not live without you. Hey, let her go. Come. - Shruti! Shruti! Shruti! Shruti! Come on move. Move. Shruti! Shruti! Please don't go. Don't go. Please leave my hand. Don't you believe all these people? The world exists of faith, Shruti!

Your father said, this is earth, this sky and God, your believe him. And today all these people are saying I am telling you... ...but your not believing it. Go, go, go. Get going. Before trusting anyone one has to love him. It means, you have never loved me as you don't trust me. Go, go, go. Hey, no one will stop her. Go away from here. Let her go. Let her. Clear out. If anybody tries to stop her I will kill him. Go. Go, go, you people go. Hey, let her go. Hey, no. Hey, Shruti! Shruti! As if today I will everyday pray to God... ...the don't ever remember me. You won't be able to bear it. Go. If you are going, go. But before you cross Phoolwadi, you will find I am dead. And you too won't be able to live after that. Shruti, you too won't be able to be alive. Shruti! Shruti! I love you Obi. I love you. I love you! - You've remembered everything, Shruti? No. I don't remember anything. I don't even remember I ever came here. Whether I met you or not... ...whether I loved you or not... ...I can't remember anything. But the agonies you are going through for my sake... ...and are ready even to die... ...and I kept rejecting you all the time... ...despite that you kept loving me.
