(jaunty organ music) (moody electronic music) [Man] What's the hurry, what'd you page me for? You come with me. The chief wants us to steal a top-secret name list from the Black Ninja Organization. And where is it now? In the vampire headquarters. You go off now, I've got some personal things to attend to. (explosion rumbles) (ominous music) (explosion rumbles) [Black Ninja] Hm. (whooshes) (thuds and whooshes) (grunts) (clangs and whooshes) (grunts) (whooshes) (steel clangs) (Black Ninja groans) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (rumbling) (grunts) (vampire laughs) (thud) (groans) (vampire screams) (White Ninja groans) (thud) (vampire laughs) (thud) (vampire laughs) (rumbling) (ominous music) (jaunty music) (telephone rings) Hello, Royal Hotel. Please hold on. (telephone rings) Hello, Royal Hotel, please hold on. (telephone rings) Hello, Royal Hotel. (operator laughs) Nobody called Benson here. Hello, Royal Hotel. Huh? I told you before. We don't have anyone called Benson here. Everybody thinks he's staying here. They just wanna speak to him because he's a millionaire. Every other call's for him. I've got it, he is here but he's traveling incognito! Do you really think so? This is the most successful hotel. It's the best one in town, where else would he stay? (operators laugh) (ominous music) [Operators] Mr. Ho! You girls aren't concentrating, back to work! What an old bore he is. Hey, what do you think of my act? (playful music) (operators laugh) (operators laugh) Mr. Ho, we were just discussing how much you care for us. You seem so concerned for our welfare, and we're very grateful to you. Thank you very much. (operators laugh) Thank god. Hey, shift's over, you can leave now. Okay, girls, move out! (operators laugh) - See you, bye! - Bye bye! (peaceful music) Hey, I wish we didn't always have to do the night shift. Yeah, me too, we could go to the disco. - Disco. - That's right, just our luck. We're so talented. Oh, I'm exhausted. Yeah, me too. - Taxi! - Taxi! - I'll take this one. - Okay, see you tomorrow. Hey, are you going alone? Watch out for the local flasher. You tryin' to scare me? [Operators] Bye bye! (ominous music) (monk mumbles) Have you got back the confidential document stolen by the Purple Ninja Organization? Okay, we've got it. Otherwise, our whole organization would be destroyed. Great. Well done. Give me the document and let me destroy it. From now on, no obstacles hinder our development. (monk grunts) (casket creaks) (vampire laughs) That's the end of the Purple Ninjas. Can you send me two vampires to help out? But you two were students together. How come you're enemies now? It's just we don't share the same opinions. Don't talk to me about the past. Why do you want them and what do you intend to do? This task is difficult. We're cooperating to control the entire hotel industry. You're a manager in a hotel that benefits from this. I know that Benson's in Hong Kong and how wealthy he is. He's a very important figure and we must kidnap him. All and well, but that still doesn't explain why you need the vampires. I'm sure the Purple Ninjas will step in and ruin my plan. The point of the vampires is to divert their attention so that things go smoothly. (suspenseful music) Why so late? (operator gasps) Why so late? (operator gasps) (operator sighs) Mom, you scared me! I worry about you traveling alone. I don't like you working at midnight. Mom, I'm alright. Well, I still worry. Now, go off to bed, tomorrow's Sunday, and you know you've gotta go to church, go on. Okay. Goodnight. (camera clicks) (camera clicks) Give me a pose! (camera clicks) (camera clicks) I've got a funny feeling... - Huh? - We're being watched. (ominous music) Looks okay. We're in position, make our first report shortly. Up. Up behind you. Mm, I think so. Carry on. Keep taking pictures. Mr. Benson's car has just driven off. He's with two other guys, get ready. [Black Ninja] We're all ready and in position over here. As soon as this car passes the spot, we'll go into action as planned. Everything is going smoothly this end. How's it going with you? Great. (tires screech) (thuds) (whooshes and thuds) Stop! (thuds) (groans) Stop fighting! Why you always act against me? What have I done to harm you? The reason is simple. You've gone against the spirit of the ninjas. You're corrupt and evil. You have to change your ways or I won't work with you again. No way, baby. I'm afraid one of us must die. What's the matter with you today? Some strange things happened. It all started when Boss Benson hit town. You're just scared to know the truth. I'm not scared, one of my best friends is a ninja! (suspenseful music) Hey look, Joyce, the red light's flashing, but there's no ringing. Did you put it through? Not me, perhaps it's not working. Check it out. [Man] Hey, killer. Have you gotten your orders? [Killer] Yeah. I just heard that Benson's employed two ninjas to investigate our organization, we're on red alert. Hey, I just heard a conversation about the mysterious Benson. Really? You listen. Hm. [Man] Killer. You've got to stop them doing any investigation. - How? - We'll send our own guys in. To stop these two ninjas and then we'll kill them. And then our boss will control the hotel industry. (moody music) Hey! Quick! (man groans) God. (explosion rumbles) (dark atmospheric music) (electronic zap) (ninjas gasp) (funky music) - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Using a pig and a vampire? (Laughs) You're the one who likes all this strange stuff. Don't tell me you don't believe in vampires. (suspenseful music) Hey, did we have a costume party? No. I saw two vampires. Where? I didn't see them. You need some sleep. (dogs bark) (suspenseful music) Do you know where the London Theater is, please? The London Theater? It's long closed. It isn't, my grandfather took me there yesterday. (laughs) (operator whines) (operator pants) Elsie, what's the matter with you? You look as if you've seen a ghost. What's wrong? I don't know what's the matter with me, I'm going crazy. I keep having weird experiences. Look, don't be scared. Here, you can have my rosary. And you must read the Bible every day. God will keep you safe. (Elsie laughs) Thank you, Mom, I think I'll go to bed. Right. (wind blows) "And God said unto Moses," "'I've got some commandments for you." "'Go and get a pen and write them down.'" (knocks) (suspenseful music) "Though I walk through the valley of death, "I shall fear no evil, for thou art with me. "Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. "Ye, though I walk through the valley of death"... (knocks) (gasps) In the name of God, the father of God, the son of God, the holy ghost, I promise I'll never, please go away! From the beginning. "Though I walk through the valley of death"... (knocks) (screams) "I shall fear no evil." (knocks) (tense music) [Mother] Elsie? (Elsie sighs and laughs) (dramatic music) See, Mom? They really did use a pig. What does it say? "Yesterday afternoon at about two o'clock," "an elderly couple were hit by a flying pig," "as they walked past Chi Sing Building." "The pig was killed instantly," "as it had no head for heights." "The elderly couple fared no better and they died, too." Oh, god, I never heard anything so silly. Must be all these nuclear explosions. "According to the investigation," "the pig entered the building earlier," "and was believed to be part of an assassination plot," "that landed on the wrong target." Well, what a way to go, huh? Oh, that's really strange, it's not an accident. Of course it's not an accident, we know that! Pigs never just fall off the tops of buildings. It's really crazy, I want to know more because I think it's related to Benson and his hotels. You be careful. Not a good day for the elderly couple. Hey, isn't that Alex Chang who models those great Italian shirts? So what? Do you know him? No, that's the trouble. Give him a chance, he might be shy. I don't think so. He's coming over here! (playful music) Hi. Ladies, do I know you? Maybe you know us from somewhere, but I don't know you. (Alex gasps) (operator sighs) (Alex laughs) Surely you must have seen me before? Of course I have, I love fashion shows. Oh, someone who appreciates me. May I join you? Not exactly a laugh-a-minute, are you? Don't you have anything to say? From the way you behave, I'd say you were scared of your wife. Oh, but I don't have a wife. So you must be afraid of women, otherwise you'd be married, huh? Please, ladies, don't pick on me. We're only teasing you. We're really happy you came over to speak to us. Don't be worried. My name's Alex. It's not your fault, your parents chose it. We've gotta go back to work. We work as telephonists in this hotel, give us a call. Of course, thank you. Hey, ladies! You haven't paid your bill. (playful music) (funky music) (ninja sighs) (ominous music) (ninja screams) Get off! (yelps) Get off! (screams) (thuds) (thuds) (vampire groans) (thuds) (thuds) (grunts) (thuds) (grunts) (vampire laughs) (thuds) (grunts) (vampires laugh) (vampires laugh) (electronic tones) (vampire laughs) (explosion rumbles) (thuds) (vampires laugh) (thuds) (grunts) That vampire really tried to kill us. No problem, I can destroy them all. The problem is they have Henry to help them. That is a problem, Henry is a bastard. I must kill him. He's become part of the Ninja Organization. We must be careful now. I have confidence I can destroy them all. How? We have to separate. You tail Henry. I'll use the hotel operators to flush the vampires out, and I'll kill them. Alright, let's go. (telephone rings) [Man] We failed to kill those two agents. [Man] We'll have to try again, this time be successful. Otherwise we'll fail to take over the whole industry, and we'll lose control. That's right. If we fail again, we may lose our own lives, Henry's mad that even the vampires can't beat that lady ninja. - Oh, no! - It sounds bad. Keep in touch. Go on, what else is there? I've realized that there's a conspiracy. One of the men is Mr. Ho, I'm sure. He works for a Henry someone. I don't believe it. - And he uses vampires. - (gasps) Wonderful! I've always wanted to see a vampire! So it's a conspiracy of ninjas and vampires! It's very dangerous for us. There's a lady ninja involved. And Mr. Ho is a really bad guy. (gasps) [Operators] Mr. Ho. Why aren't you answering those phone calls, huh? You're irresponsible. Get on with your work and answer the phone! Damn old hypocrite. We all know about him, don't we? No need to worry, I'll contact my ninja friend. It's great Joyce's friend will help us. We'll have to watch every move Mr. Ho makes now. I think he has a double identity, and controls the vampires. I think that's right. We should call the police. He'll just fire us if we do that, and then they're free to do whatever they want. I think we should just listen, then we can obstruct them with all their plans. [Operators] Right! (suspenseful music) (telephone rings) - Okay, so what do we do next? - Very simple. We'll stage a car smash. - A car smash. - Who's it gonna be this time? [Man] It's the millionaire Philip Wong. F&B manager in this hotel, he's suspicious of me, and he's been watching me a bit too closely. I've decided we've gotta get rid of him. - What's his car number? - Of course. It's 888, he leaves his home in Senhue Villas each morning at nine o'clock. Get on with it. Hey, hey, he's planting a car bomb on Mr. Wong! What's Mr. Wong done to make Mr. Ho wanna kill him? That's right, he must have discovered the truth! Right, we'll help Mr. Wong. Elsie, listen, this is really dangerous, you know. If you weren't a very good friend of mine, I wouldn't do this. I know and thank you, Freddy. Now, first I'll explain what the aim is with this. We wanna save Mr. Wong's life, don't we? - Mm-hm! - Mm! The first thing we have to do is persuade him not to leave his house, and if that fails, plan number two, his tires, we let the air out! Understand? - Yes! - Yes! How about you, Freddy, you understand? Yeah. Good. Betty, you go out and check the place now. Right! (suspenseful music) (dogs bark) (Betty screams) - Hey, what happened? - He has guard dogs! Let's no wait anymore, we'll take action! Yeah. (dogs bark) There. Coming, coming. What do you want? We work for Mr. Wong at the Royal Hotel. We wanna speak to him urgently. [Woman] Okay. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you! [Group] Mr. Wong! What are you doing here? Mr. Wong, we work in the telephone room. And we've come to tell you, your life's in danger! How can you know me, are you fortune tellers? No, we just know you'll have a car smash today. How do you know that? Elsie heard some conversations, like that one about the pig, and now it's about you! I heard some men planning to bomb your car, to kill you! So we came to tell you. That's right! I don't believe a word of it. [Group] Mr. Wong! Go on! Go on! Mr. Wong? You've got to believe us. If you go out in your car today, you'll have extremely bad luck. Cut it, piss on it, shit on it! Mr. Wong, you really ought to trust us. Don't go out and especially not in your car. I'm the F&B Manager. How can a hotel run properly without any food? What would happen if everyone just sat at home all day? - Mr. Wong... - Alright. Thank you very much for your concern, but then, I don't believe a word of it. Asam, show them out! - But... - Wong! Would you come this way, please? - But... - But, but... Hey, what do we do? Please come this way. (group sighs) (group sighs) - Plan number two! - Right! Hey, Asam? The hotel we're working at needs a new manager. The other one just died and I know you have a relative who's just arrived from China. Yes, but he didn't even complete Primary One, like ABC. Doesn't it matter? Oh, most of our managers are like that, it doesn't matter. No problem, come on. Oh, good! (Laughs) (man hums jauntily) (playful music) (man wolf whistles) Me? Hi. (Freddy whistles jauntily) (air hisses) - Hey, it's okay! - Hey, okay! Are you interested? - Come on! - Okay! Yeah, but some other time, bye bye! Bye bye. Everything went well! (operators laugh) (group giggles) (man giggles) (man hums jauntily) Hey, what are you doing? Just look at the tires! Go and get the Mercedes. Yeah, right away. What an idiot. (group laughs) Hey, we did it! (car starts) (group gasps) Another 888! Freddy, go after that car, hurry up, go on! Alright, alright. (suspenseful music) Here he is! Don't lose him, Freddy! Alright, alright, I've got him. [Betty] Go on, Freddy, move it. Pass him, Freddy! I can see him, don't panic! [Betty] Pass him, go on, go on, go on, yeah, Freddy! It's as well we came prepared. Get ready, come on! (tires screech) (air hisses) (group laughs) We did it! (group cheers) - Go and get me another car. - Yes, Mr. Wong, right away. It's two minutes to twelve. (playful music) (gasps) Another 888! (group sighs) (group groans) Hey, wait! Will you stop it? I want to get to work. Do you wanna die or something? What's wrong with you? I guess you were serious, weren't you? I'm glad you finally realize! Now, Mr. Wong, your car isn't very heavy. We'll push it out of the way. You sit and watch it, see what happens. If nothing happens, go on! Okay, we'll see what happens. (tires screech) (explosion rumbles) (group gasps) (flames roar and crackle) (group gasps) (grunts) (whooshes) (thuds and whooshes) (grunts) (ominous music) (grunts) (whooshes) (thuds) (grunts) (whooshes and thuds) (grunts) (explosion rumbles) (clangs and whooshes) (grunts and groans) (Black Ninjas groan) (ominous music) Royal Hotel. (telephone rings) [Alex] Oh, it's a beautiful thing. I'm just crazy about you. - You're just crazy, period. - Please say you'll meet me. I can't bear it. Tomorrow morning, then. 10 o'clock at the pier, alright, Louie? [Alex] I'm not Louie, it's Alex, remember! Sorry, it's just a name, I didn't mean anything serious. [Alex] So you'll come, then? Okay, for sure, see you then. Bye bye! Bye bye. - Are you going, then? - Yes. (Giggles) [Man] Hey, it's me, the car bomb didn't work. [Man] Ah, that's bad news, Mr. Ho's really angry. He has to explain this to Henry, and worse, Mr. Wong's watching over him more closely. [Man] Do you know what, the car was empty. [Man] Maybe the red ninja lady found out about our plan. [Man] Well now we've gotta try a different play. The boss is really annoyed. We fooled them! (operators cheer) [Man] Serious this time, it's at sea. I think we'll have to use Mack and Dick for this task. I can train them. Well, that's good. Just make them efficient and no more failures, okay? [Man] Alright, don't worry about it, I'll handle it. Are you trying to get fired? No, Mr. Ho, we just want a break, a day off or a week. That's all! I don't believe it. (telephone rings) Hello, Royal Hotel. - Mr. Ho, please. - Oh, Mr. Wong. Just a minute, please. Mr. Ho, it's Mr. Wong for you. Oh. Hello. Mr. Ho? Yes, sir, how can I help you? [Wong] Give those three telephone girls a week's paid leave, will you? Starting today. Oh. Yes, sir. [Wong] That's all. I don't know how you did it, but Mr. Wong says you get a week's paid leave. (operators laugh and cheer) Oh, we get a vacation! (suspenseful music) [Man] Listen up, this time no mistakes. The ship's number is 1997, that's all. I didn't catch all that. I don't know who it's gonna be. Come on, let's forget it and plan our vacation. (Laughs) (funky music) Wow, look at that boat. Whoa. Wow! Come on, let's get our stuff. Yeah, hurry. Ah, it's really big, look! Wow, come on. - Oh, it's great. - Yeah. Hey, is this Mr. Philip Wong's boat? Yes, it is, come onboard! (Freddy laughs) Shall I take your luggage for you? It's okay, we can do it ourselves. Hey. Hi. Am I on time for the big date? (ominous tones) (engine churns) (suspenseful music) (snarls) (sailor moans) (moans) (sailor screams) (moans) (floor buzzes) (sailor groans) (laughs) Hey, let's swim, come on! Hurry up, come on! Okay, then. - One, two, three! - One, two, three! Wee! (laughing) Come on, you! Yeah, come on! (slap) (Alex screams) - Alex! - Yeah, yeah. - Did you lose something? - It's okay, don't worry. I can find them, don't worry about it, it's alright. Don't worry. Hey, over here! I've got them! (Laughs) (operators scream) (Alex screams) Give them back to me, give them back to me! It's no joke, give it back! Please! (Betty yelps) (group laughs) (ominous music) (Elsie yelps) - It's you! - Come on, it was only a joke. (laughs) (laughs) I got you! (Laughs) Come and get me, you can't get me! (Elsie gasps) (suspenseful music) I'll get you for this, Freddy. (laughs) What's wrong, huh? Freddy, did you pull me under then? No. - You mean it wasn't you? - No, we were all over there. But, but someone was pulling me under. Hey, maybe it was just some seaweed catching your legs! (laughs) - Could have been. - Yeah, yeah! Hey, come over here, come on over! They're over there, let's go, come on! (clangs) (grunts) (ominous music) (clangs) (grunts) (grunts) (whooshes) (clangs) (grunts) (clangs and thuds) (grunts) (Black Ninjas scream) (whooshes) (explosions rumble) (rumbling) (Purple Ninja groans) (Yellow Ninja laughs) I wish I was rich. I'd have my own boat and be in charge. Wouldn't spend my time running around after people. I'd have them wait on me. Not clearing up after a bunch of slobs who've got nothing better to do than to get drunk. [Elsie] Hey, Dick, I'm hungry, let's get something to eat. We could go home and have a barbecue. Okay. Hey, you lazy bugger! Haven't you got any work to do? (tense music) (thud) (screams) What's up? What's wrong? I feel so useless. It's alright for you, you're good at everything. You always have been, singing, dancing. I can't do anything. Don't say that. You're very talented. If you'll just work real hard, you'll get what you want. (Freddy laughs) (Alex laughs) (Alex snarls) (Betty screams) (Freddy and Elsie laugh) Hey, let's not stay here, let's walk up the hill! - Great. - Okay, come on! - Come on, let's go. - Hey, wait for me! [Alex] Really strange, kinda creepy around here, isn't it? Yeah, I got shivers, I got goose pimples. [Betty] Do you think there's any ghosts around here? Probably, and vampires, too. You know, I've heard vampires only come out after dark, and they particularly like the forest and what they do is they join in with a group of people and nobody suspects there's a vampire there and then the other vampires appear in a long line and they follow each other blindly, as if led by one flame. And you know what, they carry lanterns, too. It's kinda creepy. (groups scream) Crazy guys. Hey, you shouldn't frighten people like that! Are you okay? Okay, I've had enough, let's go back. - Yeah, me too. - Okay, come on. ♪ Michael, row the boat ashore ♪ (suspenseful music) ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Michael, row the boat ashore ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ (group laughs) Come on, let's go, come on. Oh, his hand's ice-cold. [Alex] Hey, don't push! Come on, let's go. Oh, I'm starving still. - Oh, that was fun. - What a good day. - That was great. - That was fun. (ominous tones) (Elsie moans) Huh? (Elsie groans) Elsie, what's wrong? Why are you yelling like this? We're gonna die! Elsie, what do you mean? Elsie, stop crying. Elsie, what is it? I don't know what's wrong with her. What's the matter, what's the matter, Elsie? - What's the matter with her? - I don't know! The number! Look at the number on the boat! You mean it's 1997, the number those guys said? (Betty screams) (men groan) - What's wrong? - Don't know. Hey, come on, tell us what's wrong, what's happening? (talking over each other) How is it dangerous, you tell me. (talking over each other) Let's get off this boat, real fast! - Let's go. - Come on. Hurry, hurry! Quickly! Hey, Mr. Mack, Mr. Mack, we wanna go home! Please take us back! (ominous music) You'll never leave this boat alive. (group screams) (moody electronic music) Dick is a zombie! (group screams) (thuds) (grunts) Get out! Where's the boat? Oh no, they've let the dinghy go! That's right, I think they've got us trapped here. They'll kill us! (Betty screams) Oh, we're gonna die! (thuds) (grunts) Freddy, just hold on, we'll save you. One for you. Come on, idiot! Oh, Freddy, this is it, we'll kill those zombies! (clangs) (yelps) (clangs) (grunts) (ominous music) (moody electronic music) (group yelps and screams) (Alex screams) Oh, no. (group screams) Come on, let's get outta here! [Alex] Come on, quickly! Betty, come on, in here, quick! (Elsie pants) (gasps) Where are the others? (ominous music) (screams) (thuds) We're gonna die, we're gonna die! What can we do now? Shh! (thuds) (Betty screams) (Betty screams) (thuds) (thuds) (Betty screams) (screeching) Where'd that come from? Where'd the water come from? (Betty screams) [Betty] Oh no, Freddy, no! I can't swim! Freddy, help, I don't wanna drown. I'm so short! Freddy, help. I'll drown before you do. Save me, Freddy, please get me out of here. That way we'll die, this way we'll die. Let's try our chances. (suspenseful music) (Betty screams) (Mack and Dick groan) - She scared me to death. - And me, too. Worse than a cop calling. (knocks) - It's Freddy, it's Freddy! - Open the door! Lock the door, hurry! Wake up, Betty, wake up! You'll be okay, you'll be okay! Come on, Betty, wake up, wake up! - Speak to us! - Come on. - Am I in heaven? - Of course not! We're all here, it's alright. Freddy, you saved my life, didn't you? Yeah. Where are my shoes? Don't be silly. (Betty laughs) (glass smashes) (group screams) (tense music) (Joyce screams) (Joyce screams) (thuds) - Are you okay? - Are you alright? (glass smashes) (group screams) (Elsie yelps) (Elsie whines) - Are you okay? - Elsie, Elsie, Elsie. Over there! Guess what? - What is it, Joyce? - What is it? I've just had a brilliant idea how to kill zombies. I'll need a jug of pee pee from a virgin boy. Really, is that all? I'm a virgin. [Group] You're a virgin? I'm full of bullshit. I've never touched a girl before. (girls giggle) Well, you better go and take a leak, then. (girls giggle) Hey, do it in this. Hey, Elsie, leave him alone. Hurry up. I don't wanna go anymore. I'll help you. (mimics water spraying) (Alex groans) (girls giggle) [Alex] Half full. Hey, stop laughing, will you? This is no laughing matter! (girls laugh) Come on, hurry up. Alright. You go. - Me? - Of course! You're much braver than I am, you saved Betty. You're taking it, alright? I'm not doing it, it's your pee pee. You should be the one to take it. I can't do it, it won't work with me, go on, you do it. Go on! I really have to take it? - Of course you do. - Oh, alright. Well, hurry up then, don't just stand there! And don't spill it or you'll have to do it all over again! Huh? Have you got that? Yes, yes. Well, go on. (suspenseful music) (Dick gulps) (spraying) (playful music) What are we gonna do, huh? (knocks) Who is it? What happened? (Elsie gasps) (thuds) Jesus, they're smashing the ship! (group screams) What are we gonna do now? (talking over each other) Be calm, everybody. (talking over each other) Hey! Hey, be quiet! I've got another way. What is it? We can use this fire extinguisher, but make it work differently. We want it to shoot fire instead of put it out. What do you think of that, what do you think? (talking over each other) I don't know how to use this! - You can do it, come on! - Alright, I'll try it! Come on, Freddy. Are you ready yet? I think so. - Let's sing a bit! - Let's sing a bit. - Let's sing a bit. - Let's sing a bit. Let's sing a bit, oh. (group screams) Sing something more cheerful! You got that? Sing something more cheerful! Sing something cheerful! Sing something more cheerful! Sing something more cheerful, now come on! (moody music) (suspenseful music) (playful music) (suspenseful music) Do you think they've gone already? I hope so. I don't see anybody here. (group sighs) - Hey, let's sit down. - Yeah. Thank god. (group sighs) (ominous music) What? (Elsie screams) Freddy, behind you! (group screams) Back off! Back off! Go on, Freddy! Come on! (flames roar) (rumbling) Hey, it's starting to rain! (Dick and Mack laugh) (group scream) (talking over each other) (group cheer) (flames roar) (rumbling) (group scream) (strong wind blows) (clangs) (screams and grunts) (clangs) (screams and grunts) (Elsie screams) Help me, help me! Help me, help! Elsie! I'll save you! Wait for me! (girls scream and whine) (girls scream and whine) Freddy, are you okay? (Joyce sobs) (group gasp) It stopped! (group cheer) (group groan) I'm so tired. (group sighs) (gasps) Freddy, start the engine, start it now! The engine? I don't know how to. Oh, come on, you can do it, come on! - I'll try. - Hurry up!
