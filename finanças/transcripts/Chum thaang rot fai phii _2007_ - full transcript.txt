Ake! Ake! Ake. Hey! What's wrong with you? Why the hell are you calling me? I'm trying to sleep. I think you should find a new contender. He might know that he's not in my league. Better take back what you just said. Although it's a sure loss, I still wanna try. I'm ready, Jerd. -No, Toh! -Fucking cheater! -You're such a sore loser! -Remember what you promised your mom? Number 39, please. Daddy, hurry up. Anyone know where those mascots are from? Hello. Don't move! Stick them up! This is a holdup! Shit! Why did you shoot that for? This really is a robbery. I'm damn serious! Mued! Get in the van! Kai! What the hell are you waiting for? Get in the van! Kai, hurry up! Get in the van! Hey! Kai! Hurry up! -Help me! Kai! -Do you want to die? -Help me! -Forget her. Come on! Don't leave me! Help me! -Go! Kai, you idiot! -Help me! Help me! Don't leave me here. Kai. Kai. Why are you frowning like that? Did you lose? Oh. Do you know who I am? If you won, why the long face? Just sick of the sore loser. Are you done packing the stuff for me? -Well, you know who I am. -Oh. The cassette and the player are in the envelope. As for the train, there's no first class. So I booked the second class for you. I gotta deliver the stuff. Please watch the store for me. -May I borrow your bike? -Sure. -Hey! Be careful. My bike is powerful. -I know. Joke, did you get a lot of money? Just drive your damn car. It's none of your business, Ake. But I have a right to know, Joke. I said, drive your damn car! Joke, you gotta remember that if you point your gun at my head, then you're going to have to shoot me. Remember that! -Watch out! -Oh, no! Bastard! You ruined all my stuff! What did he scold me for? Kai, what did I run into? Tell me! Fuck it! I don't give a fuck whether you bumped into a dog or a man. Just get me away from those damn cops. Look! A police car! Luckily, I'm not dead. Is everyone all right? I'm fine. -How the fuck do you drive? -I drive like a superstar, idiot! Next time, I'll let you drive. Is my face still okay? Kai! Come and take a look at my face. Who the hell is that? Boss. Come here. Take him as our hostage. I don't know where this way will lead us to. Boss! You go and find out, you faggot! Go! Move it! It's going to rain soon. Why so suddenly? It's good if it rains because the cops won't be able to find us easily. Why didn't they pursue us? Those damn cops must be like you, a wimpy druggie! Hey! Get him! -Go! -Come on! Ake! Do you have a problem, young man? Better kill him now, Boss so we don't have a problem later. Can you not butt in for once? Where the hell are we? I don't know. I don't live around here. Why do you wanna know? You are going to stay with me until we're safe from the cops. And don't cause me any more trouble. I'll get your ass back one day. Ake, are you feeling like I feel? Feeling like you? Am I feeling like you are now? What kind of stupid ghost will show up during the day? Idiot! Follow me. You gotta keep a close eye on that jerk. -Ake, let's go! -All right. Hey! Don't fight! Hey, Ake. On platform two, the outbound train is headed to the northeast. Train number 231. Please proceed to get your ticket at the ticket window number 2. Boss. ...as scheduled. All passengers for the train number 231 to the northeast. Bang Sue 2 to Nakornratchaseema. The train will depart Bang Sue 2 at 9.30 AM. I'd better keep my mouth shut. You won't be in deep trouble, if you don't try to scare the shit out of me. We'll wait until nightfall before we split. Well, did you forget to do something before we push off, Boss? We'll split the money before heading out. -Are you satisfied now? -Fantastic! What about that pretty face? What are we gonna do with him? I think I'm gonna give him some money so he can settle down. Good idea? You idiot! Boss. You pointed your gun at me in the car. Would you like a shot? So you don't have to pay for cutting it out. Bad idea, Boss. What if the cops hear the gunshot? If you didn't drive the car for me, you wouldn't be here barking like this. Doesn't anyone feel something like I do? Joke. Joke... It's dark outside now. And it's raining too. So what? Please let me go. I don't want any money. He thinks that you're gonna give him some money for real. Robbing the kindergarten. How did you come up with that idea? Because I love kids. No, no. I don't buy that. I think he must have an inferiority complex. His parents couldn't afford to send him to kindergarten. You know too much, Kai. Kai. Go check it out. Why me? You all deserted me. -I saw you got shot. -I saw that too. Well... How could you know that we were hiding here? Even if you hide in hell, I can still find you. I'm just joking. I'm going to my hometown on this train. I'm taking you with me. Interested, Kai? Bye-bye Bangkok, my heavenly city. We finally made it! You've got your money now. Are you cutting your dick out? I'm June. What's your name? Your time is almost up. Just tell us your name. Say your name now! Toh. My name is Toh. I hope you will not kill him. I don't know yet what I'm gonna do with him. I heard something. Of course, you're not deaf. That's right. There must be a party on this train. -Ake. -What? There is no cop here. Nobody pays us any attention. Look! There's a party over there. Let's go. Hurry up. I've heard about cruise ships. I've never heard about a cruise train before. Fantastic! Hail to the Thai Train! This is so awesome, Boss. What's up, Boss? Boss! Boss! This bedroom is surely for the high-class. Inside is even more elegant. We hit the jackpot! Excuse me. Can I get through, please? I want to rob this train. Really? What are you thinking? You think that I want to join their party or something? How are we gonna get out of this train? Shut the fuck up! I have a plan. What's your plan then, Boss? My plan is you gotta watch this bonehead. Good! So I don't have to kill anyone. I love you because of this. You're easy to deal with. Let's go! This handsome Toh is mine! You don't like the music? I hear intervening noises. The player might be broken. Do you want to get out of this train? They will kill you. I wanna get outside. I don't like being in confined spaces. The food is ready to serve. Would you like something to drink, ma' am? Do you care for some beverages, ma' am? Care for a drink, miss? Please don't do it. It's a sin. Hey, Mued. Don't make yourself obvious. Don't you remember what the boss told us? What kind of deity will help wicked men like us? Kai, I'm feeling a bit spooked by the hag ghost I just saw. Ridiculous! I think you must be too high on those amps. Mued! Mued! Where the hell is he going? Fuck it! Not gonna give a damn about him anymore. Mued! -Mued! -Kai! Kai! Help me! Hurry up! Are you hiding around here? Kai! Mued! Where the hell are you? Stop playing! Get your ass out here. Kai! I'm scared. Kai! Help me! You abandoned me. It's you. Help me. The hag ghost is gonna kill me. What the hell are you grabbing me for? Let me go. Let go of me, June. Let me go! June, let go of me now. Please let me go, June. Don't you see? She's coming. She's going to kill me. Let me go! Hey! What's wrong with you? Why are you yelling? I see. You don't have to tell me. You didn't see what I've been through. You'd never know, Kai. I know. You see what I see, right? Right! I see you're so amped that you're acting crazy. Come. Letâ€™s have a chat with the boss. I'm not gonna take this anymore. -I think we gotta change the plan. -How come? That's a good idea. Let's kick this wimp out of the team. I don't know what he's so scared about. Aren't you frightened at all? After the robbery, how are we going to get out of this train? What if they fight us? -Can we handle that? -What are you two fighting for? The boss is changing the plan. Don't you know that? That's right, Boss? Now, someone knows that we're robbing the train. Holy shit! I think for this job, we've gotta ask June for help. Boss. June and the hostage have disappeared. Yeah. They are not at the vestibule. Toh is scared of confined spaces. He asked to be outside. Toh is scared of confined spaces so he asked to be outside... And you fucking believe him? I promise I won't interfere with your plan. I'm serious. What are you so worried about, Joke? If he causes any trouble, he can't get away from us. I hope it's roomy enough for you here. If I come back and don't find you here, don't even think about the price you'll be paying. You can't imagine how high it'll be. I've got a problem that needs your help. Those three are waiting for you. Where is Mued? He went to the restroom. He said it's very attractive. Gross! Just to release his stress as usual, I guess. Damn luxury for what? Ghost!! Help me! -There is a ghost in the restroom. -Ghost? What kind of ghost is spooking you, junkie? It's a ghost. I saw my reflection... in the mirror. Anyone can see their own reflection in the mirror. But that refection was staring at me when I was sitting on the toilet. I'm sick of this. I told you to kick him out of the gang. If you see what I saw, I wonder if you'd still bark like this. Shit! Robbing is not fucking wicked enough for you? You also wanna be a rotten drug freak? How many times have I told you to quit it? No, Boss. I haven't taken any drug at all. Nobody is gonna believe you. Can you not butt in for once? You ugly faggot! Joke, you haven't told me what you want me to do. Mued, is it so damn hard for you to keep your mouth shut? I'm Ratree. I'm Toh. Why are you looking at me like that? Well... Your face looks very familiar but I don't remember where I've met you before. You suspect the newcomers, don't you? Ms. Ratree, I have something to tell you. -This train... -Toh, darling. Did you forget your promise to Joke? This girl must be the one Joke told me about. Please do not help them commit more sins. I believe you, but I'm not sure if Joke will buy that. Just wait until I finish my job. I'll be back to finish you two off. Anyone has any more problems? Boss. I think he has a problem. No, I don't. We know about the robbery plan. Now what about the fleeing plan? I'm ready, Boss. Let's do our beloved job. Just tell me your plan, sir. The first step is I want you to keep an eye on those two. Don't let them get away to ruin my second step. Why me? Because he trusts you the most, I guess. Kai. You watch them right here, okay? Don't let anybody in or out. No problem, Boss. -And you, Ake. -Yes? -Come with me. -Yes, Boss. You're not gonna make it! You're underestimating my boss. You know what? From now on, I don't have to snatch old ladies for drugs any more. Damn! Only forty-something bahts? What the hell! Water is dripping everywhere I sit. Don't even think of causing me a trouble. Boss. Just now... I've saw a girl blocking the train. Right here, Boss. Bitch! Get away! What's wrong? I've been driving this train for a long time. I never saw something like this before. -Why did you stop the train? -A woman and a kid, right? What did you see? Why nobody seems to care about this? They're fucking mean people. Shit! The plan is still the same. Good! Let's rip them off! Get everything out of their mean ass! Great! Get on the train. Ghost! Ghost! Don't! Did we just walk in the rain outside? That's right. Look! It's still raining. Shit! Why didn't I get wet at all? Now you know... how it's like to be haunted by a ghost. I could feel it ever since I stepped on this damn train. How about you, Kai? You said my fear... is complete nonsense. -And you... -Toh and that girl. Why are you not watching them, Mued? They might have taken those people also to go hide. I hope you're right about this. Go get those two! Go! As for you, I'll deal with you later. Have you looked thoroughly? -Not yet. -Why not? You bitch! What the fuck are you bumping me for? Nobody is here. I'll go look elsewhere. What the fuck is your problem? Don't you think it's so weird? Hundreds of people on the train... have all disappeared. I don't give a shit. The boss wants me to find Toh and the girl. That's all I know. And didn't you see something suspicious when the train stopped? I heard something from underneath. So I looked down to check. Do you know what I saw? A woman and a kid were getting on the train. -That's why I was in a hurry. -You're too high on drugs now, Mued. Believe me. Ghosts don't exist. But that bastard Toh really pissed me off. Wait until I catch him, I'll surely kick his fucking ass. Is he on the roof? Are you out of your mind? Which part of your brain did you use to think? If you were him... would you go hide on the roof? I remember now where I've seen your face. You're a model, right? My friends are really your fans. Some are even crazy about you. You have something important to tell me, don't you? That woman... That woman and her gang are going to rob this train. How do you know? I overheard them when they were talking about their scheme. Why did you wanna tell me about this? Because... I didn't want anything bad happening to you like it happened to me. They ran away from the police and held me hostage. Whenever we arrive at the next station, I'll get you out of here. We can't get off this train. You go search the front, and I'll search at this end. No matter how many ghosts, you just shoot them! That woman. That woman. That woman. That woman. Ratree! Why are you dragging me here? You're breaking the rule of this train. Are you aware of that, Ratree? That man... I mean Toh. He is confused about what has happened to him. Not only is Toh confused, but those men who secretly got into this train are confused too. -But... -Those who are on the train... will know when their time comes, the time that they will know the truth. You'll be the one who reveals that truth to them. I hope that they'll believe you. Ratree. Mued! Did you sneak out to take drugs again? Where the hell are you? You bastard! If it won't stop dripping, fuck it! You're so mean. You didn't help me! If you'd helped me, I wouldn't be like this! Kai! Fuck him. Kai! Shithead. Kai! You fucking shit! Where are you, Kai? Kai! Kai! Where is he? Kai! Kai! What the fuck happened to you? What's wrong with you? Kai! I'll take you all with me. Remember, Ake? No! I'm not going. I'm not going with you! Help me, Ake. Where are you going? You've ruined my plan. You gotta be responsible. I don't know what happened on this train. Liar! Why did you kill us? I don't know you. How could I kill you when I don't know you? Please do not harm me. I don't know anything. Go away! I'll shoot you! What sin did I do? I didn't do anything. What do you want from me? All right, I believe you. You're a ghost. It just so happens that I'm not afraid of a ghost. Do you have anything more terrifying? There is something that you don't know. This train won't stop for anyone to get off. What do you think, Mr. Toh? Don't you find it funny? You can board the train but can't get off. I believe this woman. Why? So many strange things have happened on this train. That makes me believe. I got out of the train once. How could I have done it then? That might have been an exception. I am that exception! There is no exception! Help me, Boss! Because I'll take you with me. Where are you going, Boss? I'm getting the hell off this train. Nobody can stop me. You can't leave us, Boss. I'm leaving. Are you coming with me, Ake? We can't go, Boss. Please, I beg you. We can't leave. Ake. I never listened to anyone, not even my dad! Who the fuck do you think you are? No! What is that? This train is haunted! You're dead. If Kai hadn't deserted me, I wouldn't be dead. You're dead. Are you cold? Why did you kill me? What did she scold me for, Mued? I'll take you... to hell with me! Only souls that depart their bodies can board this train. Like myself and other souls that you saw. -But I'm still alive. -You said you believed me. I believe everything you told me except for the fact that I was dead. Do you know that I'll ordain for my mom in a week? She's waiting for me at home. That's the problem. I don't believe you. I'm not dead. You're a ghost, so be with your ghost friends. Can't you stop messing with my life? Wait! Though you're dead, you'd not abandon me. Why the hell can't you believe me? I don't get it! Earlier... all souls were in their places. But you couldn't see them. Only those who accept their death can see just like I see. I can't see anything. So I'm still alive. I'm not yet a soul. May I check your ticket, please? Thank you. Your ticket, please. Thank you. Your ticket, please. Thank you. Please come with us, Boss. I'm not going with you. I'm going home. Take me with you, Boss. Don't worry, Kai. We're returning home... to our maker. I told you I'd take you all with me, remember? Bull shit! You all back off! I'm gonna get off this fucking train. I'm sorry, young man. This train won't stop until it reaches the destination. Nonsense! If it can run, it can stop. Who the hell are you? I gotta check all souls before arriving at the destination. You should have the death certificate ready. I'm not a soul. I don't have it. I'm not a soul. I don't have it. I'm not a soul. I don't have it. I'm not a soul. May I check your ticket, please? Thank you. The palm lines indicate that you're alive. When your life ends, those lines will disappear. But I'm not dead yet. I have the palm lines. I'm still alive. Why does this man have palm lines? It might be the worry in the other world... that makes his soul still intact. Actually, it's beyond my ability to explain to you. I wanna tell you that this train is a train of souls, and all souls must accept and believe their death... before they can board this train. I don't care if this bitch is a ghost or a living being. If you dare follow me, she'll be surely dead for the second time! Hold on! All souls in this train will be in trouble if you can't retrieve Ratree. It's useless. We're all dead. A gun cannot kill the souls. I'm not dead! If I can get inside the locomotive, I can stop this train. You just shut up, bitch! Let her go! -No chance to be ordained for mom. -Toh! Help me! You have no way to stop this train. I'll show you how to stop it. Wait! I don't think you two have a chance. You die! Die! Stop or I'll shoot! Help me! I believe you now that we're dead. Don't let me fall off. Help me! Don't let me fall off. Don't let me fall off. His soul will suffer in the worst abyss of hell. Because of his bad Karma, he'll not be reborn. What would have happened if I'd failed to save Ratree? Your palm lines are still there. What does it mean... Ratree also has palm lines like me? We're at the hell gate. It's too late. We're at the hell gate. It's too late. Get off from the roof before entering the gate... otherwise, your soul... will become a wandering soul... that will never be reborn. Listen to your earphones. The time is up! Go to witness your death... and then come back to me. Hey! See you at the soul delivery station. Why did Ratree still have palm lines like I did? Because what happened to that woman... was unlike yours. This one is still alive. Hello. I'm at the stairway. Why are you in such a hurry, young man? This is not the last train. Attention, please. The International Special Express from Butterworth... will be arriving at Bangkok station at platform three. The International Special Express train from Butterworth... will be arriving at Bangkok station... at platform three. Thank you. Attention. Everyone who is waiting for the passengers arriving by... The International Special Express train number 36 from Butterworth... Please proceed to wait at platform three. Thank you. It's not my time yet, but my body has already been destroyed. So I can't get back to it. I have to wait inside the train of souls... until my time comes. The demise of drunk driving accidents during Songkran holidays... is 423 bodies in total. Train number 13, picks up souls at these scenes immediately. Subtitle translation by Chaimas Sainampueng
