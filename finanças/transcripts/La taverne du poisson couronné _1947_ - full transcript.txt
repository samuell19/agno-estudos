The wind! -What's going on? -The engine's damaged! -Is it bad? -You kidding? The connecting rod cap broke. We're across the swell. This boat's going down! Get to the pumps. I'll go to the engine. And the fire? Maintain pressure. OK. -So? -The propeller. The controls gave out. We're changing the rod cap. I knew something was bound to go wrong. If the old man heard you, you'd be done for. You think that's funny? Funny? You bet! Good thing the cargo hasn't come out with all this. Can you imagine? Truck wheels. We'd be capsized before we knew it. We got her, Captain! Careful! No false moves. Ho! Oh! -Is that you, Monseigneur? -Yes, Captain. How long? -How long? -One or two hours. Two hours! But one of the pumps is failing. We'll never make it. I saw the Bahamas hold out nearly three hours before sinking. Ho! Yes, Captain. What are you clenching your ass for? -Me? -Yeah, yeah. I know you. Come up! I'm going to see the captain. I won't forget this. If you live long enough. Ah. There's no sail! Back to the pumps! What are you clenching your ass for? I'm not. I know you. Get to your post. Make some coffee. -What are they saying? -The wind is up. Great. They've been asking for two hours. Forget it. Captain's order. And send out an SOS? -Probably. -OK. The captain wants you in here. OK. He's yelling. Now's not the time to ask him about the SOS. So? So? I'm coming! Are you coming? Yes! What are they saying on the radio? They're asking for our position. It might be wise to send out an SOS. The men are upset. I'll knock out the first one who gives in! Young people! What kind of a crew is this, scared of a little turbulence? If I don't get the Violent out of here, my name's not Palmer. Get the hell out of here. You know what I've got to say about it. And the water on the deck? We're bailing it the best we can. But every time the bow goes down, they get hit with a ton of water. That'll wash 'em up! What are you laughing about? Think of Belotti. He must be terrified for his cargo. We'll bring it back to him. -Go throw some oil on the water. -Aye, aye. "Aye, aye, Captain." Aye, aye, Captain. If we have to hang on two hours, we'll hang on three. And when we get there, we'll feast at my son-in-law's! At the Crowned Fish. Don't worry! You'll see those fine-legged girls again! Curtain! What are you waiting for? -Go ahead! -Go on! Turn around! Turn around! What bad luck! Cigare, are you deaf? Answer the telephone. I'm not here for anyone. Oh, boy. -Hello? -What's this dish? -Whiting. -Whiting? It smells bad. -It was caught this morning. -What are talking about? Here, smell it. What's that smell? -Whiting? -Smells like it was drowned. -Sorry, Fleo's busy. -Thank you. -The Violent? -Silence! -They're not responding? -One minute! Stop! -I can't hear with the storm. -Stop the storm. Don't worry about Palmer, he can swim. What a clunker! -Was that Belotti? -He's worried about his junk. He can just kick the bucket, then he won't worry anymore. Hey, Mili Milis, what are you waiting for? My compliments, Marianne. This whiting is so fresh! More like sea bream! -What? -It smells. You're not going to keep the pianist busy all night, are you? -We're not landing in time. -So? We have to. Where do you think you are? The opera? It's simple. You come out on stage and smile. The audience thinks, "Say, they're happy." They're happy to know you're happy. So everyone is generally satisfied, you see? Come on now. One, two, three. There! Stay like that! Turn around! There. Dance that way. -Sir! -Trust yourself! It's all about the visual! Give the audience what they won't dare ask for. We're working at the subconscious level. Go on! Bring the back curtain down! OK. -Since you wanted us to turn around. -My sister and me. Yeah, whatever. Get outta here. Where's Sylvia? There she is. So? I'm waiting for you. No, I'm waiting for you. It's because of these two, here. We couldn't get the number down. Lout. -Go get dressed! -Yes, Mom. There you are! Let's see it! This is a poster? What the hell is this? A fashion ad? -The butterflies. -Let me see. Good. Sylvia Corail, see? Do you have a lot? Put 'em up everywhere, all over. I want them everywhere! Thank you. -Your wife. -What? She's watching us. Maria, go to bed. I don't need you. I'm not tired. Sylvia's going to rehearse. I don't mind. But she minds. Don't worry. She'll regret this. What now? Cigare, go get that! OK. I'm ready. Do your entrance. Is he asleep? It's not his fault. He did weddings all day. I'll wake him up. Hey, wake up! Where do you think you are? Who is it? -It's me, Belotti. -OK. Did you hear? I was just at the weather forecast. Situation unchanged. And that damn Palmer isn't answering the radio. -We know. -Belotti. Fleo, not worried? I'll be right with you, old boy. I'll never see my shipment again. A shipment of truck wheels for next to nothing. Maria! Get him some coffee and a brandy. Go on, do your entrance. -No, darling. -Let me finish. Don't laugh like that… You're a vamp! So, make that horseshoe-shaped sad lip. Soft eyes. You need to be mystery in the fog. Is that all? I don't need you to teach me how to do my job. Possibly. But you're not alone with a man. You're in front of an audience. You're working with a crowd. 300 guys all together is only ever one man. Hang on! I'm working! I want to bring cinema to life. OK? Have you seen The Blue Angel? That's what it is. It's Marlene. -Marlene? -Why not? If you'd just listen to me, we could do wonderful things. Here, straddle the chair. -Straddle it? -Yes, like Marlene. Very good. Sylvie, I've got you under my skin. Now behave. Well, if you've got me under your skin, you'll behave. Yes, we'll figure it out. Keep going. Go ahead. The second couplet. I'll go see the other idiot. Go on, the chorus! Come on, producers. You break everything. I complain a bit and you come out in the sun. Go ahead. Belotti, what fine wind brings you here? Fine wind? That's a good one. So? -Who? Where? What? -The Violent! If Palmer sinks. What? You hear how he talks about your father? -Oh, Marianne understands. -Oh? -I understand everything. -Ah? He knows I could lose a million. We know, old boy. -It's starting again. -What's that? -I'm going down to the port. -OK. See you tomorrow. Cigare, would you see him out? Very good! I don't want to bother you, but between you and me, your father is in a pretty tight spot. Does it make you happy to say that? I own half that ship. My money's in danger, too. But… Why are you stopping? Keep going! -What's wrong? -I don't like wearing myself out. I'm coming. -Say… -What? -If he doesn't come back? -What? -You wouldn't get rid of me? -I know you. When I've had enough, you'll leave to be able to ruin my life. -I'm waiting. -Yes, yes. Do the chorus again. -You're right. I'll go. -Of course. But not the way you think. Don't speak ill. Your father's sinking. It's not draining anymore. Too much water in the pumps. We need all hands on deck! But the boys are angry. I'll throw them in irons! Now go! Well… Happy to. Captain? Captain! Captain? We should still send out an SOS. An SOS? We could sink 20 times before they get to us. Now bail some water! With the buckets and your hands. On the double! Captain! The engine's calling! Ho! Guimel. Ho! We're all fixed up! OK. En route! It's working! Bring her up to 60 revolutions. Hard-a-starboard! Hard-a-starboard! Easy does it! 118. 118, OK. Stay the course! What's that? It's the cargo? Yeah. The clasps broke! Get some gasoline. OK! Ho! Samir, take over. To port. -OK. -Not so fast! Christ. Take her down to 40. I think we're OK. There's no way to grab them, but the wheels are wedged on their own. We need to get some space with that crap rolling around down there. If only we could see! It's the oil. Good times. I'm going to go check on the lifeboats. That'll keep your mind occupied. Easy! Like a newlywed. Good times! Ah! People. What are you doing in there? What's going on? A stowaway! -Throw him overboard! -He can't swim. Bring him up so I can get a look at him. Here's the glutton for punishment! How'd you get on board? You must have had help. I got in on my own. I see. Well, my compliments! We could give him a little pick-me-up! Nothing doing! If he wants to pass out, he can go right ahead. Where did you think you were going? My way. Don't try to take the piss out of me! Piss? I'd be rather embarrassed. There's a light port side! Where? It's gone. There's a ship port side! Looks like a trawler. Christ, he's headed straight for us! Sirens! He's coming from port side! I've got the right-of-way. I'm not moving an inch! Looks like he's having trouble steering. Too late. Stay the course. We're going to be cut in two. Stay the course! We're not pirates! Not an inch, you hear me? To port! You can't! What'd you say? You've got no right, you bastard! I'll turn you in at the port! …break your face! Cheers. Just barely! Take the wheel. Looks like it's calming down. Yes, indeed. Take him down to my cabin. I can help you. -Are you a sailor? -No, just a doctor. -Send me a sailor. -OK. Here, drink this. This is the first time I've seen a doctor onboard. In life, you go where you can. What a night. -Couldn't put a parrot outside. -Idiot. Shut up, idiot! -That better, chap? -Yeah. -Your captain really did you good. -And then? He really has to respect someone to hit 'em. All right. Take the watch. -Give me that. -Idiot. Proud of yourself? Damn fool. "Fool"… -Go find some dry pants and a jacket. -I'm on my way. Thank you. You don't look like an idiot. -No joke. -No. I like you. Your rebellion up there. Oh? Yeah. I don't like cowards. The hard part is always being better than oneself. Being equal to oneself, anybody can do that. Why are you telling me this? No reason. Have you had problems as a doctor? No, not as a doctor. -Where are you coming from? -The northern Amazon. Two years with the jungle people. -Yeah, right. -No joke. -I was even a gold prospector. -Ah? -Like everyone. -I made a fortune twice. Lost it twice. Are you intending to take another boat? No, I've seen enough countries. -You know where you're headed. -Yeah. Back to square one. Oh? To find someone I care about. I've got my mind made up. And if she's not there? If she's changed? I'll know her by her name. Sylvia Corail. -Sylvia Corail? -Yes. She's an… exceptional woman, as they say. A woman just for you. Why are you laughing? I'm not laughing, it hurts. Sylvia Corail. That bitch won't get me tonight! I didn't sleep all night. I've got more than a million in merchandise in there. You'd have grieved. Oh! Maria. That's nice. To think you could have sunk with my wheels! He's in his cabin. Not this way, you! That way. -I'm glad to see you. -He's making himself nice for you. Come in. Maria! My little penguin! That's nice. How are you? -Good. -Have a seat. Don't mess up my nice new suit. I'll get dressed. Were you worried sick about your old man? Maria! Palmer here. I asked if you were worried sick. What? What's with you? Were you that scared? Forget about it. Come on, give me a kiss. You look odd. You're not crying over me. I had it all wrong. What's wrong? Here, blow your nose. What's wrong? Maria, my little penguin. What is it? Answer me or I'll smack ya! It's Fleo again, eh? What'd he do this time? My poor thing. How could he lead you on like this? To think he had to take advantage of… I mean… That I had to go sail the south seas for him to marry you. I know. You were lost, and he wowed you. He talks and talks. Christ, how he talks. I wonder where he learned everything he doesn't know. What a rotten bastard. Twenty years older than you. He'd already done his time when you were a baby. A gangster, a ringleader, that's what your Fleo is. If he didn't own half the boat, I'd have thrown him overboard. So it's another woman, eh? He doesn't care about you. I wonder who he's cheating on you with. Do I know the harlot? Oh, I know her! Don't cry! I don't like it when you cry. It makes my throat hurt. I'm OK now. I just need to let it out. That's good! So, who is it? -Sylvia. -I'm not surprised. They're made for each other. Like a rat and a sewer. Sylvia. OK, go back over there. You haven't seen me, and I don't know anything. -What are you going to do? -Don't worry. Ah, Sylvia. Monseigneur? Hey, Monseigneur! Hey! Bring me the stowaway! What? The stowaway! Hurry up! Ah! -Double ration? -All of it. What are we drinking? Don't look at my cards! Get out of here! So, has the ship come in? And Palmer with it. -Don't talk about it. It makes him sick. -No! The easy times are over. They're going to come back. Here we are, at the Crowned Fish! Hey, boys! Hello, darling! Hey, guys. What, you can't stand up? Cigare, how's business? Good. Am I bothering you? I hear you had some trouble last night? Oh, yes. We nearly went under. Set that down. Monseigneur, you're a delivery boy now. You're moving up. Respect my second-in command, will you? He's worthy of carrying my packages. It distinguishes him from idlers of your kind. -Clovis! -Captain. Glad to see you. Drinks all 'round! On Fleo. -Where's Maria? -Have you seen her yet? -Is it your business? -Just saying. Maria! Maria. Don't stay out here in the sun while those idlers hide in the shade? Hang on! On your feet! You're on laundry duty. -What? -On your feet! Laundry duty! -Are you joking? -You're the joker here. You'd better get used to the sunlight! It's hot in Guyana. You never know! Ready? What? Making a fuss, Cigare? Too bad. What is it now? Let's go. Good one. -Here. -Leave that here. May I? Hey, Marco! No sabotage, eh? Or I'll put you in the infirmary. That's better. I'd give him a hiding, but I can't do that to Fleo. Careful, Cigare! Monseigneur, unwrap the presents. Wait till you see what I brought you. This is a dress. I bought it in Liverpool. When am I going to wear this? Every day. These are stockings. These are gloves. -And this is lipstick. -You're crazy! I'll bankrupt myself for a woman, my daughter included! Isn't that right, Astor? This is Astor, a great guy. We met on board the tomb, right? This is my little penguin. Isn't she something? -Do you like it? -We picked it out together. The boss liked the top, and I liked the bottom. So we brought it. What's this? One minute! What are you doing here? Whose idiot idea was this? -I'm the idiot. -Ah! -You're here already? -Yes. Too soon? Back to work! You made it back in spite of it all? In spite of it all, yes. We were worried! I barely slept. -No! -I swear. Don't talk about what you don't know. Are you coming down? Right away. This all right? It's not great. You're not used to working, are you! Go put your stuff away. Astor, come have a drink. What'll it be? A quart of white wine. And for you? A brandy. -Make it three. -Make it four. -Hey, Monseigneur. -Sir. So, the Violent. Belotti's worried about his cargo. It's being unloaded. Here, let me introduce you to a friend. -Astor. -Sir. Not "sir" -- "doctor." He's a doctor. Delighted, Doctor. He doesn't look like much, right? Yeah. Someday you might be hearing about him. He left a woman here, went off to make his fortune, and never wrote to her. -That's not nice. -Now he's returned to take her back. What about that! Take her back… If she waited for him. He doesn't know. You went away for her. She has to go back to you. Is your mind set on it? That's why I came back. A man who comes back like that, after five years… …must be loyal! And a brandy, double. And if there's… If there's someone in her place, what'll you do? Talk it over. That's no good. You just say, "Evening, it's me," and then make the other guy see that he's a third wheel. I'd love to see that. Can you imagine the face she'll make? And the other guy! To your love life, Doctor. Cheers, Fleo. Come here, Doctor. I've got a surprise for you. Clovis! A brandy. -Where are you taking me? -Shh! It's nice here, eh? Where are we going? To your square one. Wait for us here. Come here. Yes? Hello, Sylvia. How are you? -You're back already? -Yep. You seem happy to see me. Depends why you're here. Sylvia, I brought someone who'd love to say hello. -Who? -Someone very nice. Well, what's he waiting for? Come on in. I won't introduce you. Pierre. Are you surprised? You can say that again. I'll leave you two alone. See you tonight at the Crowned Fish. It's nice of you to say hello. I'm back for good. You're staying? I want to start over with you. With me? You're crazy. Did you strike it rich? No. So you think you can just come back after five years and move right on in? Who do you think I am? -I wasted my life because of you. -And then? I didn't ask you to love me. Men are really something when they get an idea in their head. They love you, you don't love them, so you're a bitch. It's too easy. You ruined me, Sylvia. -Is that criticism? -You said you'd wait. How disappointing. I went off to conquer the world for you. -You've got the right face for it. -I've been faithful. So what if I stood you up? This is what life made that little girl into? Not so little. So young and confident. You amused me. Don't slander yourself. I knew you better than yourself. If I'm so different, you must have the wrong address. If I'm someone else, don't bother me with who I used to be. Let me get dressed. You're a great girl, you know. We have to try to give ourselves another shot. Don't let me start over again on my own. Maybe you're right. Maybe you are still good for something. With your worker's eyes. And your sea-wracked face. Sylvia Corail, Sylvia Corail! What's she doing? She can't be found. I called everywhere! Not everywhere. She must be somewhere. -I'll call her hotel. -OK. I know who must find this funny. -Who? -Your wife. Oh, don't give me that. Go find her. Sylvia! I need to speak to my partner. Go on! Leon, the lady's husband is on the dock. If you want me to pay for my drinks here, give me the 10,000 francs you promised me. OK. Send the Mili Milis out. OK. Sign something for me. -You had your portrait done? -Sign a loan agreement. I see the resemblance. Spot on. Always the same pomp and circumstance. What are these prospectuses? I collect them. Sign here. OK. -You could say thank you. -Thank you. -What's wrong? Got a fever? -I'm waiting on my star. Maybe she's a shooting a star. Astor! It's Astor! What the hell do I care? -How'd it go? -She wants to think it over. She said she'll tell me later. Come have a drink, my boy. Hurry up! Doctor! How was your lady? -Huh? -Did he find his lady? Yeah, I'll tell you all about it. It was a hoot. Hey. -Yes? -Sylvia just got here. Give me some warning! The Mili Milis. Hey, Mili! Nice. There you are! And none too soon. Where were you? We looked everywhere for you. Where'd you spend the afternoon? With whom? What is this, a domestic quarrel? We're not married. How dare you talk to me that way? You've changed! What's gotten into you? Look in the mirror. And? Do you have a future face? -A face of the future? -As far as futures go, yours is bleak. I like you, but I don't have time. We're a few leap years apart. Show me some respect! You think I'm cut out for moonlighting? I'm sick of this 50-50 thing. I want a man to myself. So choose me or your wife. You act as though we were equals in this. But take a look at yourself. Come on, be brave! I can look at myself in the mirror. Maybe I don't have a face of the future, but you've got a pretty strange past on your face. I have a man who wants to be with me. -Don't blackmail me. -A doctor! I said no blackmail! He's out there with Palmer right now. Go see for yourself. Out there with… What are you doing? The Mili Milis are done. They want Sylvia. Beat it! Let them clamor. OK, I see. -With Palmer, you said? -He's waiting for my answer. Go tell him I say yes. -What are you waiting for? -Nothing, sorry. -Palmer introduced you two? -No. Palmer just brought him back to me. Brought him? You knew him from before? Who, Palmer? -No! The guy in question. -You know? He pulled one over on me. Who? The guy in question? No, Palmer. They're going to start rioting. I'm going! Think about it. You've got all the time in the world. Three couplets. -So? -Hm? Did she need a thrashing? No, I don't want the wear and tear on my product. -The customer is king. -In the ribs, it doesn't show. We all have our own technique, my boy. Go play with your cards. Don't worry about my hand. -Shh. -Please! Clovis, a drink! I didn't think she could sing so well. Yeah. She's a woman with quite a few surprises up her sleeve. White wine. It's nice of you to want to make Sylvia happy. Yeah. -Should we tell him or not? -Hm? That's true, we didn't tell him earlier. It was Sylvia. The woman he was looking for is Sylvia. -No. -Yes. And it's thanks to you that they've found each other again. Thanks to me. My compliments. So, when's the wedding? Pick the date yourself. April first! I wonder where Palmer found that piece of jetsam Astor. And how did he know that Sylvia and I… I mean, we just started. From Maria? From Maria? She went on board this morning. -Oh? -Why? What's going on? Come with me. 30 and 50. -It's nice to listen to this. -Take it away. Move aside, idler. Good. -Come here, you. -What? You'll see. Handle the register. You're hurting me. That hurts! What'd you tell your damned father on board this morning? Oh, your police, eh? Cigare gave you his report. It was your idea to get Astor together with Sylvia. -Me? -Yes, you. -Astor? -What? You think you're smart? Don't look at me like that! Take that! There! What do you think? I was hit, eh? Of course, when the audience is all friends. I don't have to come back, if it was so bad. Seriously, who do you think you are? I know myself. -So, have you thought it over? -Yeah. You think you're so clever, with your Astor up your sleeve. Don't you see that Palmer is trying to drive us apart? -My dress. -Eh. What? Your dress? Here! Palmer didn't invent Astor! I knew him before all of you, so… Oh, my poor Sylvia, but… Don't you see that Palmer brought Astor back to separate us? He played a bad hand. I'm going to get rid of him and his bitch of a daughter. Two birds, one stone. Palmer doesn't suspect in the slightest that I've got him right where I want him, ready to throw him. -Then we'll see. -We'll see what? Wouldn't you like to be the boss here? Manager of the Crowned Fish. You'd leave me the bones. I wouldn't say no. What I want out of life, now? One night, from time to time, here and there. With someone else, of course. Sylvia. Sylvia? What do you think? -You like me that much? -What? Oh, sure, I like you. You or somebody else. But a word of advice, darling. Tonight… You and your doctor… Don't try to make a fool of me! Because it could cost you dearly. We can go. Look out below! With the oil with the tar? It'll make a nice firework! Don't jinx it! Monseigneur, you do the flying trapeze now? My respects, Mr. Venard! Hello, Captain. Here, Mr. Venard. So, they're seizing a lot these days. I have a paper for you. -For me? -A summons. -A summons? -From your son-in-law. Fleo? Fleo. -What do you think? -He's lost it. Easy. Easy! Knick-knacks. You signed loan agreements for nearly 500,000 francs. But you have three days to settle. And if I don't pay? I'll have to seize the Violent. It's the law. The law? I'd as soon throw you overboard! Go see in the basement! -This is serious? -Fleo never fools around. You'll have to figure it out with him. With that son of a bitch? You're right. I'll work it out with him. "Work it out" doesn't mean throw him overboard. I have to make that clear. Stealing my ship… May as well take the earth beneath my feet. I am merely the messenger. Goodbye, Captain. I wouldn't even have burned it. What would you have done? Personal hygiene… This is cause for celebration! I'm going to open two bottles. I recognize that one. That champagne's good for lighting up. Oh, very kind of you. Here, you open it, since you're sick. Let's drink to the Violent! To the Violent! We'll baptize it. We'll rename it the Crowned Fish. It'll be good publicity. The hard part will be finding a captain. -We need our own man. -Not Palmer. Palmer? Palmer and his daughter: liquidated. Unless… There's one of you who… who wants Maria? First bid: 50 francs. -50 francs for Maria. -51! -52! -Going twice… Do I have 53? Do I hear 53? Come on. She's worth more than that. 54 for me, going once, twice, three times. Sold! What? What is it? I didn't say anything! Let me go! I didn't do anything. I didn't say anything! You're not coming. I'd like to speak to you. In private. These gentlemen can stay. I have nothing to hide from them. My life is a glass house. An aquarium. Here. Cheers. -Cheers. -What is it? One minute. You don't want us to talk together? You can stay. Is this serious, about the loan collector? Uh… Cigare's a little out… Go wake him up. You owe me 500,000 bucks. I'd like it as soon as possible. I mean… You understand. Yes. In the next three days. If you can pay me back sooner… What if I need more time? Impossible. I can't wait. What if I killed ya? You wouldn't outlive me. Look, dear Palmer. You thought you were such a big shot. But you forced me to choose, and choose I did. I'm taking the Violent back. You get Maria back, and we're even. You swine, you son of a bitch! If you do it, I'll-- Let him go! Ah, Palmer. You just can't keep a cool head. Not a good quality for a leader. Gentlemen, you can go. He had his fit of rage, as predicted. Now he's calmed down. -Give me my loans back. -No. -You have one hour! -No! And no threats, all right? We're not going to play that game. Ha! Here! You know this? THE ILLUSTRATED EARTH A DRAMA AT SEA DURING A SHIPWRECK, A CAPTAIN ABANDONS SHIP! You're as dishonored as I am, Captain Rousseau. Here's what I think of your flyer! What happened 17 years ago concerns no one but me. You wouldn't understand, anyway. My name is Palmer now. Rousseau is dead. But I can bring him back to life. I want my loan agreements by 4:00. That's all. Maria! Maria! Maria! "Maria"… -So you don't want to come with me? -No. You came too late, darling. Have you forgotten what you told me yesterday? Of course I felt something, finding you again. I let myself go. Forget about it. No, I gave you a chance to be a little sincere. Pull yourself together, Sylvia. You'll see: we'll make it, you and I. There's no time left. There's no-one keeping you here! -I'd expected anything but this. -This, what? If he's a good man, I love you enough to disappear. Otherwise… -What? -I'll stay. -To protect you. -Go. It's better that way. Who is it? Huh? Answer me. Come in. What are you doing here? I don't mean you any harm. -How kind of you. -I am aware of Fleo's intentions. I wouldn't dare impose myself on a man who no longer loves me. So… He's yours. That's all. Fleo sent you? Oh, no, he has no idea I came. I just wanted to tell you that I'm not your enemy. Bear with me a few more days, and… Pierre! Where are you going? Pierre! Pierre! Where are you going? Do you realize what you've done? Yeah, I know the routine! You knew Astor was here, didn't you? Me? Bitch. You could have knocked. Hang on, kiddo! Not so fast. Hey! Sure, you didn't win her over, but don't leave it at that. If I were you… Let's go have a drink. IN HONOR OF THE SAILORS Look out! -Look out. -Oh! Watch where you're going! It was an accident! Imbecile! Show some respect for my drinks. Scram! Can't you hear it's ringing? Hello? Again? No, this isn't the sub-prefect's apartment! How long are you going to bother us with this? It's 67-67, not 57-67. The sub-prefecture. Oh, my word. Olé! -Say. -What are you doing here? Go find Ducouedic and Bosco out there. Evening, Maria. Hello, Monseigneur. -How are you? -Very, very well. Is there nothing to drink in there? Waiter! Drinks! Is everyone here? Yeah. But it's a tough one. -Hey… -Easy does it. Hello there. We're ready to fight. I hope, but careful. They're armed. Not a bad idea. Come over here. Hey! Stay with us. What's wrong? Are you sad? Don't worry. Good. We can have a laugh. Exactly. This way. -Hello, darling. -Hello. Everybody here? Let go! What will the signal be? Don't worry about that. Go get everyone else. Move over. -Evening, bella! -Hello, Monseigneur. You look thinner. Off we go. Maria. I feel like, I think… There's going to be a bit of a brawl. If only you knew… When it starts, take cover. What's done is done. Why didn't he… Ask the lady. Oh, my sister's here! Here they are! -This oughta be fun. -Yep. -Have you seen your father-in-law? -No risk of his coming. Hurry up! -Evening, Fleo. -Get out there. Evening, Monseigneur. -Are you here alone? -All alone. -Without the captain. -Without the captain. Look at Fleo, coming and going, joking around. He doesn't see what's in store for him. Poor Fleo. Promise not to hurt him. You're not going to tip him off, are you? With the boat seized, it's like the guys are gonna eat dynamite. We're just going to teach him a little lesson, that's all, under Palmer's orders. I'm not asking for anything for myself. I don't count. What I can say… Trust us. There's Belotti. Ah, Belotti! -I'm glad to-- -Good, good. Oh, Belotti. Great atmosphere, huh? A real sailor's pub. It's not an act, either! Really? It looks like a set. Would you like to follow me, ladies and gentlemen? Get them seated, and be polite. Please. Hello? No, this isn't the sub-prefect! Where is she? In her bath! The sub-prefect. Evening, Cigare. Nice clientele, eh? The cream of the crop. Never three. Champagne! Here we go! The whole Violent crew is here. Belotti! What a stench… Ouch! So, did you get a nibble? -Fleo! Allow me to introduce-- -Later! He's an eccentric. After your song, I need to speak to you. OK. What's that? A business card. I'll tell you later. You're on. Get out there. -I'm gonna give him a hiding. -Yeah, yeah, OK. Hey! Sylvia. I'll make her sorry she ever did this kind of work. Come down. Poor girl. Aren't you ashamed? Fleo! Come out here, so I can kick your ass! I reserved you a room at the hospital. I'm gonna show your Fleo what's what. Silence! Get those guys out of here. Come here. Don't be an idiot! Unfortunately, you need to be going. -Say that again! -Hey! Be reasonable. Don't make a scene. You could use some fresh air. -What? -Put that away! A broom is enough for this trash. I won't even speak to you. Come on, guys! The lights! Cigare! Don't shoot the piano player! The band is sacred! This is a scandal! Come on, guys! Where's Cigare? Cigare! Hello? Who? The sub-prefect? Yes, hang on. It's for you. They put me here! Clovis! Where is he… Clovis! Clovis! Clovis! Clovis! What's he doing? Here! -Clovis! -Here! -Clovis! -Here! I'm coming! Oh, man. -It's so hot. -Right? How many is that? Eight. There's still room. Bastard! I'll get you. Oh! Fleo! -Fleo, beat it! -Let go of that, idiot. Let me through. What's going on? The bastards. Fleo. Fleo, can you hear me? -You'd better get outta here. -OK. Get outta here, you damn fool! I think he's had it. Fleo. -Can you hear me? -Mm. Fleo. Sylvia. Sylvia… Listen. Listen… Sylvia. Yes? You leaned over him, and? He said, "Listen, Sylvia." And? -That's all. -That's it? He wasn't strong enough to say more. And he died. He's dead. -And what? -He's dead! You really couldn't make out a word? The secret was so secret, he took it to his grave. You were saying? It came from the bar. He was here when he was hit. He turned around to Astor, who was taunting him. -He staggered to the stairs. -And then? And then… We didn't want to move him, in case of a hemorrhage. Strange. Captain. Well… I was hiding over there, by the table, for the whole fight. I didn't see or hear a thing. So no one saw or heard anything. -Nope, no one. -So? So? It's of no consequence, since it's clear who did it. There's the knife, and the killer fled. My compliments, miss. You have a gift for stirring passions. That your favors are bid up is one thing. But with a knife… I mean… So? I don't think there's any doubt about who's guilty. We're going to arrest this Pierre Astor right away. I'll sign the warrant. Of course, we'll summon you if need be. -Captain, ladies, gents. -Your Honor. Can I stay open tonight? I don't see why not. If you think your husband's body is cold enough. Captain, ladies, gentlemen. Well, I… I'll keep an eye on your cargo. I'll come with. Goodnight, ma'am, and again, my sincerest condolences. Calm down. He died in his home, with music and beautiful women. It's the kind of death… that I wish for us all. Don't mind him. Belotti's ridiculous. In business, you hear it all. -Clovis. -Ma'am. Set the tables back up, get the balustrade repaired, and try to find some curtains. Here. Well then. After what happened between us, I don't belong here anymore. You have a contract. I intend to respect it. Leo's death doesn't change anything. You're very successful. Don't have any qualms. Besides, Fleo would be furious to hear you'd left us. -So, Clovis. -Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Tonight, we open at nine, as usual. If that works for you. Stay here, or go elsewhere… I'm glad to see you like this. I was thinking, "She's going to die of grief." I saw you crying in the booth. He wasn't even dead yet. You must have loved him. You're confusing love with self-respect. Hm? Another, please. Go on, clear out. Come on! I'm not a customer. Thank you. Well then. Funny sort of widow. She's not a wife. She's a cashier. -Sylvia. -Yes? I did you a big favor, and you don't realize it. How's that? I got rid of Astor for you. You got rid of Astor? You bet! When the judge questioned me, I didn't open my mouth. -If I'd wanted to… -What would you have said? What I know. What do you know? That it wasn't Astor who stabbed Fleo. When Fleo fell, we were fighting with Astor. I was on the floor. He had his knee on… My knee on his stomach. Eh? I'm a man. So? Now you and I can get together. Because you know… There's my hand. Astor didn't kill Fleo? Man's word. Say… The Philippines? Tell me. What did Fleo leave you? His good memory. So he left you everything. He had no choice. He was caught by surprise. The only good thing he'll have done in life is dying in time. If he'd waited a few more weeks, he'd have snatched the Crowned Fish from you and the Violent from me. Speaking of the Violent… You're going to stop the legal proceedings? So dirty. Right, my little penguin? Can you see yourself selling off your father's boat? It's the most practical solution, though. -I want to keep my half! -Oh, listen. Think it over. You and I are the same. What's yours is mine. What's mine is yours, OK. So? So… The best thing is to leave everything as is. Legally, I'll get your half back. I'll be the owner of the Violent. And… When you die, I won't have any taxes to pay on it. That's great. I'd never have thought of that. Couldn't you have told me sooner how smart you were? Oh! See you tonight, then. Hey! Sylvia! Sylvia! Sylvia! Sorry, I wanted to say… Don't blame me for Astor. I didn't think it was going to end like that. Oh, it's not over. Who knows? There might be another act. No-one saw me come in. The police could show up at any moment. You can't stay here. I'm not planning on sticking around. Can you give me anything? A piece of bread or something. Sure, maybe. Where did you spend the night? Out. They signed an arrest warrant for you. -Did they question you? -Me and everyone else. What do you expect? All signs point to you. The knife, the punch you gave Fleo. Here. I'll get you a drink. Now you know. -That's not why I came back. -Why, then? To see you. Do you really believe I killed Fleo? What do you think? Am I worth killing a man over? Drink. To give you time to think about your answer. Do you love me at all? -And if I do? -Answer, and you'll find out. No, Pierre. I don't love you. I'm happy for you. You're saving yourself heartache and a lot of trouble. I killed Fleo out of jealousy. Like a jealous husband. Ridiculous. That's what I wanted to tell you. Now I'm going to turn myself in. Goodbye. As they always say: have fun. Pierre! You're a swell guy. Forgive me. Nothing's lost. Come on. I know you didn't kill Fleo. When he was stabbed, you were fighting with Cigare. -He had a knee on your chest. -No, I knocked him down. If he lied, then it must be true. Listen, Pierre. I'll hide you at a friend's place. They won't turn you in. You have to find Fleo's killer. I'll help you. I know things. Pierre… Please. Don't leave me. Don't ever leave me again. Stay. Hello, Maria. Clovis, old boy. Find me a table. Sorry, Captain, we're all full. -For me? -For everyone. We've never been so busy. Think about it! The house of crime. The guys who thought a fight would ruin this place fight for spots now. Come on, find me a table. It'd be the first time I couldn't sit down here. Talk to Cigare. He's the boss? Cigare? May I? Excuse me. Hello, Maria. -My penguin, no hello? -Hang on. So, where am I sitting tonight? No idea. Ask Cigare. Cigare? Not on your life! Ma'am, our table isn't reserved? It is, one second. Why not? What'd he do to you? That thug! I hope you'll throw him out. Put a table over there for these fine folks. Please. Please, watch how you speak. He's a gangster. That's your opinion. Cigare knows the clientele well. I can't do without him. I don't want to see him here, OK? Don't make that face. We'll find you a table. Do you want someone to entertain you? Maria, I'm starting with the new number, the Mili Milis, then Sylvia. -Sound good? -Great. Keep an eye on the left-hand table. They like to go without paying. How are ya, Captain? We'll find you a spot. Do you have a minute? Good thing we're casting off soon. Land is clearly not my place anymore. Too many losers. Oh, about the Violent. What? I thought about it. I got some information this afternoon. I think I'm going to sell it. What do you think? Are you kidding? Am I the kidding type? You wouldn't do that to me, would you? I didn't make my decision lightly. I knew how much it would hurt you. But how long are you going to sail for? Five more years? Five years, max. What? The pharmacist is asking for off-dry champagne. What do we give him? Go see Cigare. Ah, Cigare. So. In five years, what will you be? Eh? What will you be? You know. Might as well sell now. While we have a buyer. What? It won't kill you. Lots of people live without a boat. You'll take the train. It'll be a change. What will become of me? You'll retire. -Like an old man. -You're no spring chicken. And I'll come see you from time to time, for the holidays. I won't go long without seeing you. When are you selling it? I have a meeting tomorrow. But my boat is more than just my boat. It's… my crew, the sea, all these stories that only belong to me. You can't take that away. Don't get excited. After everything I've done for you… I've done so much. Don't say a word. I'll have too many regrets. I love you. And to know you were out at sea… I'd be so unhappy. Clovis! Check the table over there. They leave without paying. -Go ring them up. -Yes, ma'am. Maria… No, let's not discuss it. It's too hard. 78 cents in change. Thank you. 70, 80… 70 and eight, there you go. You've got a table there. Order whatever you'd like. You're in my place, now. No thanks. I think I've had enough. You won't take me dancing? Oh, it's you. I thought you'd gone away. You're not safe. I need your help. I'm not good for anything anymore. Well, come on. Last night, you told me to run. I was wrong to listen to you. I lost my wits. I only said it for your own good. Palmer, I swear. It was your knife in Cleo's chest. What do you have to say about that? Cigare recognized you. Your knife. Cigare knows I didn't kill Fleo. How would he know? When Fleo fell, we were fighting. Why didn't you say anything to the judge? That's just what I can't figure out. Ask him to testify for me. No way. Cigare and I are a bit like you and Fleo. Knives out. You'd let me be sent to prison? That's not what I said. But even if you didn't kill Fleo, you didn't intend to, didn't you? I would never have killed in those conditions. Whoever killed Fleo is a coward. How could he have stuck my knife in his chest? Oh, I'm sure it wasn't for fun. It must have been in his interest. He killed him ignobly. Sordidly. Like a rat. A coward. Yes, I did it. And all for nothing. I'll write it out for you. -Idiot. -You're telling me. -Idiot. -Shut up. Shut up. My darling! Here. I've signed it for you. I needn't have written this confession. Now you won't call me a coward anymore. Astor, there's something else I need to talk about. As long as it's you. -17 years ago… -Yes, I know. Who gave you that? THE ILLUSTRATED EARTH A DRAMA AT SEA A gift from Fleo to Sylvia. His last breath. Yes, I abandoned my ship. It was a cargo ship. Run by a bunch of scoundrels. I don't care what people say. I regret one thing, and that's the boat. Supposing the Crowned Fish went up in flames. Would you run to save Cigare and his gang? Obviously, you'd go save Sylvia Corail, so… All right, chap. Cheers. And I killed Fleo because Fleo was a son of a bitch. Now scram. Go to Sylvia. Go on, get! Why are you still here? Can't you seem I'm going to die! Monseigneur! Monseigneur. Let's get out of here. I thought it was tomorrow. It's now. The crew? They're sleeping over there. -Go get 'em. -We need Eddy. We'll go without him. Get on the radio. 100 tons of freight, tar, and the rest. Bosco! Bosco, let's go. We're leaving. Up and at 'em! Come on! Hurry. Start the engines. Cast off the anchors. In the stern, too. -Got it? -Aye, aye. -"Captain"! -Aye aye, Captain. Here we go. Weigh anchor. Let's go! What's this doing here? Come on! Let's go! Engines! -All on board. -All on board. -Straight ahead. -OK. Ho! Take her up to 60. Straight ahead. South, southeast? Yes. -Southeast? That's not where we're going. -Take the watch. The captain's gone nuts. You know where we're going? What's going on? Hey! South, southeast! -A little starboard. -A little starboard. Good. I wonder what's gotten into him. Quick! The alarm! The ship's on fire. The tar's burning! Get the rowboat down. Go! And good luck. -Captain. -Yes, I know. What broke the pumps? I did. I'm scuttling her! It's a good joke, admit it. And if anyone says Captain Palmer was a coward, you'll say that he walked the plank without a word. At least, I hope so. You're not a bastard! You wouldn't have set the boat alight! May I live if I'm lying! Go see for yourself! Let's go! The boat's on fire! To the rowboat! Fire on board! We're done for! The rowboat! Beat it! Stay at the engines! We're done for! Done for… What's wrong with you? Have you lost it? Get out of here. Goodbye, and no hard feelings. I don't need you. When I said that about being a bastard, you know… I know. If you'd really thought it, I'd have put my fist in your face. Now beat it. Goodbye. No go on. Get out of here! Captain! Open up! Open up! Captain! Open up! Captain! Hey, guys. Wait for me! THE END Subtitle translation by: Adam Lozier
