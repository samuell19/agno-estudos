No one can change your fate. Why it's dark? -This side... Whom do you say? -This side, boss. Oh,this way. Dude, I'll ask her. You take care, if any problem arises. Dude,why did you push me? Who are you? Thulasi's friend? Stand aside. You follow me silently. -Why did you stop? If we search together, it's waste of time. We'll design a master plan and search separately. Yes, boss. I'll get you into trap. After a long time... Tomorrow is "New moon day". I'll open up you tomorrow,okay? I'll come with the gift only. That gift... Oh, you've come here too. You... Greetings...

Why are you afraid? Don't come out with makeup. It's awful. Why did you shout? -I caught a thief,sir. Villangam, you! Sir... Let it be. Why did you do so? Sir, let it be. You must inquire him. We jumped over the wall, I agree. But,why they must jump? It's right! Why did you come so? We came out for a walk. When he jumped over the wall, we came behind him. We must guard the young girls, who has come here. You guard them! Dude,I understood why and how did you come? But,when you speak, you can't get the dialogues. What do you want to say? Don't say anything. I understood. Now, everyone leave from here. Go away... Listen, remove the make up and get in. Go... Sir, your hands are shivering. My hands and legs are shivering. Yes. We'll come after finishing everything,sir. What can I do? It's all because of him. Be respectful to women. Are you so respectful? Get lost. Sorry... sorry... A Wright! You disturbed me and left. You... I have no idea of attending the camp. For you, I came to your locale. Hey, didn't you sleep? "If Miss gets missed, she will be as Mrs." "Kiss, when kissed enters Guinness".

If you go on like this, it'll take 20 years to learn. Boss,Thulasi. Why she goes in a hurry? There must be some stuff. Come,let's overhear what happens. Move aside. Mom! -Thulasi. Mindless. Wait. Mom, how are you? I'm fine. How are you? I'm superb,mom. Okay,how was your trip? Good. I enjoyed the most. I missed you badly. I too missed you badly. I have a surprise for you. Boss,it's interesting! Is my family matter interesting to you? -That is... Shut your trap and listen. You mean, surprise? Anything special? -yes. Muruga... You open this. He is the only son of KV mills. I wish to settle this marriage. How tyranny it is! She didn't even show me the photo. Wait. No,mom. I... What Thulasi? I...I love a person. What? Love? Ask her. I thought of telling you. -If you don't ask now,it'll heighten. I don't like this love. -yes,only a few are successful. Be seated,boss. You too have rights. -Hey,you be quite. Are you going to college to fall in love? Ask her to marry the groom of her mother's choice... ... and be happy. -yes. No one need to talk. Is he a trustworthy person? Definitely, he is well and good. Suitable for our family. You'll like him very much. Better,meet him once. He won't be a liar, isn't it? -yes,mom. Please,mom. Just meet him once for my sake,mom. Please,mom. Have patience. Your happiness is mine! Thank you mom. Ask him to come. I must meet him. -Sure,mom. Okay, mom. We'll go back to our job. Boss,she accepts the love marriage. You are dumb. Will you be the head of the family... ...only in government records? Yes,I'm there, isn't it? Why are you so? Be quiet. Look there. One of my friend owned a driving school. When I went to meet him, he left to see a bride. The lass who came there resembled actress,Devyani. When I was thinking to convey my love, My good time, she came forward to say the same. Then our love was branched out around trees and blossomed ... ...as a garden in Pollachi. Her parents came to know and it fumed. Atlast,it end up in marriage! Then, hurriedly I became a father. Suddenly,her father got chest pain. When I called my wife and informed her, She told me to get him to hospital by car. I asked how do I know to drive the car? Meanwhile,her father got cardiac arrest. My wife knows only then, that I don't know to drive the car. She started to drive me from then on... Mom, you are good in massage, nowadays. I came without informing my mom, If she see us,that's the end of our story. What's happening here? We are doing rehearsal,aunty. Get up. Mom. You mean,rehearsal? Aunty? What's this? She is going to be Our daughter- in-law... ...that's what she says as aunt. He talks so confusing. My dear,my darling! Nothing. What's this? Aunty,you must speak to my mom ... ...and make our marriage happen. Yes, mom. Please, aunt... You're saying something, I will do. -Mom agreed! She didn't say anything still. Good mom! Instead of driving the car on the road, They drove on the fields. Plenty of cow dung. Bereft about son-in-law, I'm cleaning my car. The entire cow dung is on our car. Boss,clean it soon. It'll be a shame when son-in-law family comes. Watch, they may come. Boss, -What? They've come. It's like you voluntarily invited them. Can't you tell before. I'm looking grimy. Do you have a physique of going under that? Am I looking grandeur? -Welcome... We're waiting for you only. Welcome. Driver, -He is calling you. Go. Driver. -You go and sit inside. Get in. -Driver feels irk. Take coffee and snacks. We'll eat. Do I irk? Am I a driver? When did I tell so? Good pair of myself and the car. I'm striving because of you. Be seated. Haven't they seen a big house ever! Swirling around. The house looks superb. -Don't talk,mom. Have you come to see the house or the bride? Both. Aunty zoom in somewhere. Is that? It's good to explain. I know what you think about. Why they're as a pair in all except this one, isn't it? When you entered the house, the one who was... ... cleaning the car was the husband of our Madam. Why must he clean the car? He did such a deed. He got married hiding the truth that... ... he doesn't know to drive the car. The rift which started on that day, still continues. Welcome... Greetings! -Greetings! I was busy with work. What are you talking about? I was talking in praise of you,boss. You? About me? I promise,boss. Disguised as owner? Madam has come. Greetings. -Greetings. Hello. It seems they haven't seen the coffee and snacks earlier. Look here, don't talk about children... ...and other sentiments to me. Though he knows, I hate people speaking lies, he did that. If you talk about this, you may lose the job. Sorry, in-law. I never like telling lies. I will whip them to the core. I'm habitual of fulfilling my daughter's wishes. That's okay. The car... Don't worry. Madam will buy the luxurious car for your son. Not that, My son... All the accessories and parts will be perfect. Stepney. It's enough, if you know to drive and have a license. I'm not saying it for pride. The whole expense of the marriage is mine. From pre wedding rituals to first night... ... everything will be the best. Stepney. -It's enough, if you come. But? That is... I'm little bit late from Pooja. Then? Has the bridegroom family arrived? Oh,is he the bridegroom? A suitable bridegroom for our family. He is the reason for admitting... ...my daughter on time in the hospital. He drove the ambulance fine. The fact is... Our hero who accompanied his friend has to... ...get down by the driver seat, as other door was struck. The priest saw that and still is in belief... ...that our hero is the driver. Will he drive an ambulance? They'll let me in bidding. It's like a going for a harvest and getting an ox. You meet her and tell that you don't know... ...to drive the car. Go... Mom. Go. Mom,better you talk. She made her husband to clean the car. What's the assurance that she won't let him... ...to clean the doorpost and do pattern casting. Okay,mom. He can learn car driving, isn't it? If something happens then? Go...My son is important to me. If not her, some other one. Go... Mom You too. -Tell her something. She is only calling. Hey,the phone continously rings from night. Attend the call. Get up. He kills us. Mom grinds by mixie, she grinds by phone. They won't let me. What's this love? Hey,is it a must to attend your call?
