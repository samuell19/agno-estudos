The characters in this story, the situations... are not fictitious. Everything happened with me for real. If you do spot any similarities... do not worry. You are not alone! I'm Krishna. I have a problem. By problem, I don't mean something dramatic, or a weird medical condition. It's not that! So, please don't make fun of me. Shall we watch Ae Dil Hai Mushkil? Not today. I'm busy. Let me know when you're free. I'll book the tickets. I don't like watching movies. Let us watch the movie you like. I'm not in the mood to watch a movie! But you've got time to spend with Mahesh. We're working together. Obviously, we will spend time together! How can you not get it? That's not what I meant! Why can't you spend some time with me? I'm spending all my free time with you. I don't get any time for myself. You went on a solo trip last week. So? When I was here, you kept pestering me to message you. What's the point? I'm just concerned for your safety, Satya! Is that my fault? I managed to stay safe without you around. I know what other guys are like. I have every right to inquire where you are! You don't have any rights on me! I got a job at Microsoft. I will start in August. Bengaluru isn't quite far, right? We can have Skype calls and I'll come down to see you every weekend. Next year, I'll try to find a job in Bengaluru. Distance won't be an issue. I got the job two weeks ago. Do you know what does this mean? I don't feel the same way about you anymore. Didn't you notice it? Do you think everything's alright? Something has changed. You're seeing someone else, right? I saw your scooter outside Foodex restaurant last night. But you told me you were home. I was there with Shruti! Why did you lie to me? It's because you would have dropped there as well. I'll change for you, Satya! Just the way you want me to be. How will it anyway help me, Krishna? You're torturing me, Satya! Tell me the truth. For a moment, please think of all the good times we have had. She called me aggressive! She says that I'm emotionally unstable. She never wants to see my face again! Krishna, please open the door. Please go home. She's is new to this place. Open the door, bro! Dude, what are you doing inside? Please don't say anything! At least you can be happy. Hi, Mom. Let's have dinner in 15 minutes. I'm not hungry. Should I dump the food in the dustbin? I cooked all your favorite dishes! You shouldn't have eaten outside! WHY AREN'T YOU REPLYING ME IN SPITE OF BEING ONLINE? Bro, don't cry! Why are you doing this to yourself? That's how women are. She was dating many boys. She's a bitch, bro. I'm letting this go only because it's you. She's an angel, bro. What are you up to? What do you want? I felt like talking to you. Shut the fuck up and tell me what's it about. Why are people so weird? You were fine yesterday. What happened? It's all an illusion! Okay, bro. Take care of my mom and my sister. This city is the main problem. I was jobless in Vizag. Running behind girls, and getting dumped by them are our major interests. We enjoy the heartbreak! Me! I felt like the greatest lover in the world! If by any chance, it rains during that particular moment... From now, avoid girls! Get it? Get it? Get it? GAYATRI VIDHYA PARISHAD ENGINEERING COLLEGE, VISAKHAPATNAM The program is about to start. What's your name? Address me as "sir". Say it again. What's your name? Why aren't you wearing a sari? Are you too cool? I don't know how to carry a sari. But you're good at carrying a lunch box. You never forget to do that. Nonsense! That's too much! Are you Telugu? I am a Malayali. But I speak Telugu! How can a Malayali not know to wear a sari? Our culture is fucked. Do you have a boyfriend? How many have you ditched? Isn't that what women love doing? Sing a song. I want you to sing a song. I can't live without you Stop. -Without you... -Stop it! You can't drape a sari, and you sing depressing songs. What else do you know? Any backlogs? Why did you join college? Better get married. -What do you think about him? -Hey! Come on, tell me. Sitting in the last row and ragging everyone... does that make you look cool? I believe you borrowed this suit from someone. No way! His mom owns a boutique! So? You asked for it. So, you know who I am! Okay, fine! I remember saying that I need to avoid girls. She was different. Do you understand what I mean? That's why I already warned you. Don't make fun of me! Actually, I wanted to sing a Hindi song for you guys. But I just met Radha. She recently got transferred here. Satya! Satya! Oh doll When I look at you I forget to blink my eyes But you know I can't stop dreaming about you Dude! Isn't Radha cute? She's a Malayali who speaks Telugu. I think she is my destiny. I think you're a dumb ass! You need to date a Malayali once. You'll learn your lesson. I doubt he will ever learn a lesson. Why did you scream Satya's name when I was on the stage? What did you want me to do? Why are you blushing? -Do you like her? -Yeah. -Is it love? -Yes. At least he's finally out of the sad phase. I made up my mind. I hope that the next girl I meet is not like Satya. You have to move on in life. How long will I be with these idiots? Cheers to you. Hey! What is it? Are we friends? We can be. Come on! I don't speak to disrespectful jerks. I was drunk that day. So what? Is that how you speak to your mother as well? Why are you still here? Do you have any pending work to do? What? You don't need to be so rude. I got no backlogs. Then? What for? Actually, I'm not disrespectful towards women. I don't have a father. Oh. He is not dead. He left my mom when I was a kid. My mom took care of me. I have a sister as well. But I went through a bad breakup recently. I was frustrated. Did I bother you a lot that day? You embarrassed me in front of everyone! Can I sing when no one's around? Your smile is infectious. My heartstrings are about to snap. My heart silently calls out for you You're the angel stuck in my head Every breath... Inside me... Your eyes are heavenly! Your lips are beautiful Tell me. What do you want me to tell you? Why did you guys break up? Will you be mad if I say I don't want to discuss it? We're seeing each other from three months. Aren't you bored? What if I don't make up my mind? Once I clear my job interview, I'll be one step closer to being your ideal boyfriend. I can wait. Of all the qualities I'd have on my check list, you have none! This has got nothing to do with your employment status! Will you quit smoking for me? I can't do that. Please don't force me. If you had promised to quit... I wouldn't believe you. I wanted to ask you something since a long time. When can I kiss you? When you stop asking for my permission. Your words and mine... They're one and the same Every moment from now on Will be spent in togetherness, my love! Don't tug at my heart, my love My heart, it wants you My heart yearns to reach you And tell you how much I love you! My heart silently calls out to you You're the one on my mind What happened? I never expected to get selected. We didn't think we'd hire you either! Your training starts in two months. Training will be in Bengaluru. I'm going home. What happened? Is this about me going to Bengaluru? Nothing's going to change even if I'm in another city, Radha! What do you mean? Everything will change! Your timings will change. You'll get busy. You'll meet new friends. Your lifestyle will change. You'll forget me. I'm not blaming you. I just rushed into this. I didn't give it enough thought. We've just got into this relationship. So? That's it, Krishna. I agreed for this quite easily. Do you want me to fight with you? I'm guessing not! How could you say that it was easy? I had decided to stay single forever! That changed when I met you. I liked you. You liked me. Everything happened naturally. Why do you seem doubtful? Alright. Do you seriously want to break up? I just want you. Then don't go. Don't worry. Let's work this out. I love you. There are hot and pretty girls in Bengaluru. You'll cheat on me. There you go. That's what you're worried about. I'll tell all of them... that my girl is sexier than you. Come here. What are you doing? Tell me. I'm off to Bengaluru. Yeah. Let me drop you home. Krishna! Stop! Bad dream? Anyway, I've kept pickle in this bottle. Arya asked for it. Make sure she gets it. Here. I'm packing her clothes separately. Give them to her. You made Radha clean up your room. That's so shameless of you! I didn't ask for it. She wanted to do it. What do you mean? -What's the deal with you guys? -What do you think? You're moving to a different city. What did you tell that girl? If you're serious about this, I can go talk to her parents. Mom! What's the hurry? Just calm down. I want to settle down with her. Is this love? I don't trust you. Don't hurt her with false hopes like your dad did. I know. If you drink or smoke in Bengaluru I'll break your teeth. Yeah right. How will you come to know? Maybe you need a boyfriend to chill with. -Stop pestering me. -Idiot. Pack the whole house. Pack the hangers, safety pins etc. -Enough, Mom. -Wait! I am almost done. -Just one more-- -Enough, Mom! Go and freshen up now. You should have told me we were having a guest. I didn't think this would happen. Thank God! I was wearing a towel today. I'll introduce you to him. I never anticipated that you would come out in a towel. You own the coffee shop, right? Of course! Sister, I am hungry! I'm soaring up into the skies I am finally where I need to be! This had to be my destiny! You just can't wish this to happen Isn't it difficult to call at the same time every day? Totally difficult. I just want to chill with you guys here. But Radha's waiting for me to callback. That's a lot of pressure. That's not pressure. This is the price you pay. Price? For what? So that Radha stays committed to you! So, this is what Rukhsar looks like. A girl with curly hair. That's the story of my life! I am always in a relationship at the wrong time! Just look at her! A job that doesn't let you sleep So very far away from home! Gone are the happy evenings at beach road Now begins the era of silk board You're used to the cool breeze Of the beach Now you're just a corporate beach! What is the point of these jobs? Wasn't chilling at the beach enough? Lovely evenings spent at sea view! Money can't bring that to you! You were a king in your hometown! Now you're a bum in Bengaluru town! Enough of all this toil and drag! Let's pack up and leave for Vizag! How are you? Why are you singing at a bar in Bengaluru? You're bound to be frustrated after working the whole day, right? What's up? Rukhsar is my friend. Do you know her? Let's catch up. You're in Bengaluru now. Why did you breakup? Because I am an idiot! Did you see meet Satya? She looks amazing! You mean the one from that group of morons? She's not that great. I heard that you called me "average." Is that what you said? I did. I mean, I have never seen you in this attire. The boys are crazy about you. You should come to college like this. I didn't mean that you come in this attire. We will have a reason to attend college. Please don't get me wrong. Above the tank? How about Beach Road? Behind Araku church? What about your job? You're my job. Stop fantasizing about the future. The bus is empty. It's raining outside. So, what do you think? So, do you still have feelings for Satya? I love Radha! I know what you're trying to do. Why don't you tell me? Don't you have any ex-boyfriend? Bullshit! Tell me the truth. Have you never fallen in love? I have fallen in love several times. But I never ruined it with the delusion of a relationship. What? You have considerable expectations from each other. There are many conditions and rules that you need to follow. Finding the right partner adds beauty to this relationship. I mean... look at me! Then, why did you guys break up? Satya and I weren't right for each other. Getting the best of both, requires a great friendship. Don't mix them up... and get confused. It sounds like vairagyam. You are done with your life and the only thing left to do is to go to the Himalayas! I am talking about vairagyam. What's it called? Alright. You said you have no boyfriends. Book a cab. Let's go home. -I'm not coming. -Why? Why? Right here, right now! What now? Are you going to be Hrithik from Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara? And I'm supposed to play Katrina? Mom, I don't care about that. I cannot agree to this. It's not my decision. This is Arya's wedding and her decision. Do one thing. She can invite her father to the wedding. But if he is there, her brother won't be. You guys can enjoy. Stop yapping or else you'll get fired some day! I'm planning to quit anyway! I'm done! Who do you have a crush on? Look over there. She is cute. Satya? -Since when are you hitting on her? -About an hour and half! Wasted! She's my ex-girlfriend! Oh! Okay! Hey! The whole gang seems to be here. What are you doing here? We're in the same batch. What does she want? Just because I'm sober, I have to drive all her friends home! Your sister is such a nag man! I know! Get going! I'll see you soon. She's making it awkward on purpose. Isn't this awkward? Are you feeling awkward? I never got a chance to tell you. My mind is clear. But I need to apologize to you. I always feel that I dumped you. Feeling? That's exactly what you did! When did you become so mature? After you dumped me. Do you live alone? Aren't you afraid? I'm used to it now. I enjoy my space. Do you have a boyfriend? Do you have a boyfriend or not? I do! I have a girlfriend! I didn't ask you. Just because I have a boyfriend, you have a girlfriend now? I really have a girlfriend. Show me her photo. Are you blushing? Oh, come on! I don't have a boyfriend. You always said that people change with time. -You didn't. -But you did! Tell me the truth. Did you date anyone after me? I did, but... How's your job going on? It's quite frustrating. Moreover, I'm stuck at the same place. That's why I quit my job. I'm a full time Bharatanatyam dancer now. Don't do something you don't like. -Just quit that! -And? Do something new every day. It's fine if you don't earn well. But every night before you fall asleep... you'll have a smile on your face. Tell me. What about you? And? And? What else can I wear at home? What did your ex-girlfriend say? She forgot her phone. I'm returning it to her. What you up to? I am going to the college. Planning to bunk in the afternoon. What are you doing? I am driving to the office. Why don't you drive over to me? I miss you as well, Radha. By the way, do you remember Satya? Satya? I ran into her at a party yesterday. Is she in Bengaluru? What did she say? We just had casual talks. Carry on. I'll call you later. Did I do something wrong? I just wanted to be honest to her. Maybe I should shut up! What's your weekend plan? -I am going to Coorg. -Hey, nice! Who are you going with? What does she mean? Is she dropping hints? Don't fall for this! It's not like I don't have anyone to go with. Why is my life in such a state? My life Our incomplete love Ms. Rukhsar asked you to stop singing. Oh fuck! Who gave this to you? How are you? -Really? -Come on. Shall we go around Bengaluru? I've visited many places in Bengaluru. Wait! Why Coorg? What's in Coorg? We'll go to Chikmagalur! Right from the moment I saw you You've been haunting my heart! My gaze never shifts from you As we meet in these Beautifully strange lands Every day I start afresh, I'm born again The moment we come in contact Boundless excitement beckons us, Let's wipe all the lines clean The time I get to spend with you is nigh! Let this world be all about us Let me find myself in you! I don't really want a lot in life! I don't have such ambitions. Homemaker? Do you think that's easy? It's probably the toughest. Let's decide their names as well. I don't why... My heart refuses to stay still It's searching for a way out What is this magic? My dreams have exceeded The scope of my sight! They move beyond We surrender to our bodies, To the shudder in our steps, Let's hurry, let's hasten, Let raindrops refill the ocean Let's break every boundary And finally be one! Let the lips fight the revolution Let the air sing of our being together! When are you coming back to Vizag? I will be coming for Arya's wedding. Let me drop you off to the airport. If you come, I won't let you come back. No. Your situation is extraordinary. Do you know that? Why? Your girlfriend just left. Now your ex-girlfriend is calling you. -Watch out! -Are you crazy? Satya is history! Forget it! Don't convince me but yourself! It's not in his control! Your feelings can't follow any rules. You need to be clear about it. How can feelings be restricted to a single person? It has no boundaries! Are you high? This is known as the stoner science! Please ignore her! She keeps saying she's single. Is Satya dropping hints for me? Well maybe she is. You were an overgrown man-child in college. Now you're man with a settled career! Why would she let you go? What do you mean? I told her I have a girlfriend! She said that Radha didn't look that great. Recently I learned a new word called insecurity. When I told her that I saw Satya, Radha wasted no time coming to Bengaluru! When I was in Vizag... Radha and I weren't in a physical relationship. I'm not going to hide anything from you. But... in our recent trip to Coorg... She was all over me. Did you promise each other to get married? Yeah. Dude, she got you! How can you be so dumb? Look at Rukhsar! She comes to my room at night... and falls asleep while watching a movie. She casually walks out of my room every morning. But I am sleepless the entire night. We sleep in the same blanket. All your problems include good-looking girls. How do you manage it? On one hand you have Radha, and on the other, it's Satya. When neither of them are available, you have Rukhsat or Kismat. What's her name? It's Rukhsar! She's wild! -Not a joke! -Such chicks need to be banned! -We are nowhere close to her. -I agree. It's quite advanced. You won't get it. I can't do this anymore! I'm not going to see Satya anymore. Why are you so bothered? I have a concert next month. Wait for 15 minutes. I'll get done with my practice. You can sit inside. I haven't moved on. I can see that! Had I not met Radha, my life would have been different. I need to tell her. Do I need to say something? She'll understand if we stop meeting. It's better to tell her. I need to get away from Satya. But, what do I tell her? All you're supposed to do is, rest. How will you manage? Shall I call Rukhsar? I'll be here from morning to evening. Can you manage by yourself at night? What about your job? You quit? Could you get me a bottle of water from the fridge? I need to have my medicine. I'll leave now. Looks like it's going to rain. That's why I want to leave. Why did you dump me, Satya? I agree I was... immature and aggressive. You shouldn't have dumped me without a reason. You didn't have to break my heart. Krishna, I wasn't much older than you back then. You shouldn't expect me to be mature as well. Let's not meet for a few days. This is exactly what I wanted to say the other day. How does it matter who says it? It's the same thing. Why did you wait for so long to say this? It's because this is how I always wanted you to be. You already have a girlfriend. Harsha, I'm busy. I'll call you back. Where are you? I'm with Satya. I'll call you back! Hey, Krishna, I tried calling you so many times. I feel that you don't love me anymore. I don't love you either. By the way, give my regards to Satya. Why did you send such a message? Everything was fine between us. I suppose we should both feel the same way. Why are you here? Do you think your sweet-talks will work? You don't have time for me. This is happening since we got back from Coorg! You hardly talk for a few minutes. Even then your mind is distracted! You're not the same. You've changed. Baby, why are you talking in this manner? You've been avoiding me for a week now. You were busy with Satya, right? Your first girlfriend! Satya broke her leg. I was helping her out! Couldn't anyone else help her? Why did you have to help her? Thank God! You were there! You should have told me about it. I didn't want to make you feel insecure, Radha! Well, now I am! The long-distance relationship isn't working out for me. We got stuck in different cities. I had to go to Bengaluru because of my job. Really? Your mom told me that you quit your job! But three days back, you told me that you were in office. I quit that job. I can't trust you! Please don't do this. Time is your problem, right? Don't worry about Satya! There's nothing going on between us. What if I stayed over with my ex-boyfriend for a week? I always feel that you're hiding something from me. I'm not hiding anything from you, Radha! You know everything about my life! You have an encrypted folder in your phone, right? What's in that? It has some pictures that were sent to me by my friends. Show it to me. Radha, those are just some stupid photos! That's alright. I still want to see it. Give me your phone. Let me unlock it. Tell me. Those photos were taken during our college days. Leaving Vizag used to be quite painful. But that's where I have always had my breakups. I'm dying to get back to Bengaluru! I can't keep sulking forever. When will this end? I wished on Radha's birthday. I wished her for her exams. But she didn't reply me back. What am I supposed to do now? There's no point wasting my time being lovesick. I have to move on! Does Radha think about me? It's been three months. I don't know what she's up to. She doesn't have many friends. Think about yourself. She is ghosting me now. If you miss her, then call her and sort everything. What do I say? Since you aren't dating her anymore you have nothing to tell her. Right? She blocked me, Rukhsar! Stop making excuses. Go back to Vizag. You went once for her. After our last conversation, I wasn't expecting you to come. This is your dream, Satya. I wanted to be here. I don't know much about Bharatanatyam but... Everyone was clapping for you. I have got to tell you two things. One... This is your first successful dance performance. And second, I am famished. Thanks isn't enough. I need a treat. When did you learn to cook? After I left you. What about you and Radha? I got to know about it. Yeah, it's been three months. What happened? If it's too personal then... Nothing as such. I was with you when you broke your leg. I didn't tell her about it. Is that the reason? It's one of the reasons. I didn't tell her that I quit my job. So... it's my fault. Actually, it's all my fault! It's because of me-- It's not your fault. This shouldn't have happened. It's not you. Nothing happened between us. Didn't you tell her? She found some old photos of you on my phone! I never deleted those pictures. Do you want to share something with me? I think you're a bit late. I am done with that phase. Didn't you sing this to me once when you were drunk? I guess you were apologizing to me. I don't remember all this! Stop bluffing! I remember it very well! We both had the same exam hall. Shit. I still don't remember her face! I just remember her waist. I think I flunked that exam as well. We fought like dogs that day! You ignored me for her. Pissed me off. It's like I'm time traveling! Krishna, what are you doing? Krishna, I don't want any complications. Let's not think about it until we are 100% sure. What do you mean? I agree to what you said. Idiot. Tell me. Go on. I feel weird about what I did that day. I just wanted to clear it with you. I don't want to stop seeing you. Are you clear about this? Okay, bye! I came to check on her. Why do you always make me beg? Am I supposed to eat alone? Come with me. Send me the address. We'll be there. I will be out on Friday. Come on Saturday. You can spend some time. We won't have that much time. Is Krishna coming with you? Shall I go? You can crash here if you want. Don't lie to me. I said we could never be together. Last night... you said certain things... and did this to me. You did this on purpose. You're all mine! All of me? Yes. I can't keep losing you and ruin my happiness. You get it? Now... Is it clear? Bro! How are you? Where are you? I'm at Satya's friend's wedding. The kitty party gang. We were bored, so we're playing cards. Listen to me. I have a news for you. Make sure no one is around you. What happened? Radha is coming to Bengaluru tomorrow. She wanted to surprise you. Go and meet her. I don't need any more complications in my life. No one's asking you to get married. She misses you a lot. I am just asking you to meet her. Listen to me. Didn't you miss me? I'm sorry for dropping in suddenly. Hey. It's no big deal. I didn't want to tell this on call. When we were in Coorg... I had the contraceptive pills. Please don't cry. I understood only when I got pregnant. I missed you. And you were my first love. It's okay. I don't care if we never meet again. You will be my first and last love. Have some water. Here you go. Take a sip. How's Satya? I don't know. We're not in touch. Really? I can't stay without you. I will meet you at Arya's wedding. Where do you see us five years from now? A duplex house. A BMW car! I will be heading to the office in a hurry, and I'll realize that I've forgotten something. You will bring me the suitcase, give me a kiss, and send me off to work. I've been very patient enough until now. Everything is happening according to your plan. I just asked for one thing. Don't invite our so-called father to this wedding! Mom said the same thing. Don't involve mom in this matter. This was my decision. I want my father to be present for my wedding. I don't want to feel like an orphan. Is she an orphan? Were you out on the roads as a child? Watch your words. After all these years, she wants to invite him now! Go ahead! I won't be attending! I'll be there with you, at the wedding! Let's meet in Vizag. I need to talk to you. Will you misunderstand me if I ask you not to attend the wedding? Can I ask why? It's a long story. My mother, Arya and everybody is acting whimsical! Radha will be there as well. I understand about everyone else. I won't be myself. It's going to get awkward, Satya. Nobody ever understands me. I will not attend the wedding if that's what is best for you. Bye, dear. You have to attend the wedding. He sent this for you. He was asking as to why you didn't come in. I told him you didn't want to. Bloody poser. He could have come here if he really wanted to meet me. He didn't want to force you. He'll meet you at the wedding. -Like I care! -What's wrong? It's a nice house, bro. Why didn't you stay back with him? You met him? No. I didn't meet him. Why? Hey, baby. You guys started your trip? Yeah, we're on our way. What did your father say? Nothing. I just told you that I didn't meet him. When did you tell me? I mean... I didn't meet him. You should have. You might have said something. Please! I don't want to talk about it. Hey. Guess what I'm wearing! Nothing! What about Satya? Here's a live example! If I had someone like him as my life partner, I'd have murdered him already! Hey! Shut up! Would you be okay if someone did this to me? People call this as cheating. There were hundreds of questions on my mind. "Love happens once in life. And marriage is the next step of love." That's what we were always told. My mom will flay me if she ever found out. All of this happened because... loving two people at the same time is wrong! What if it wasn't wrong? All said and done. Have you ever loved two people? I don't mean loving one person and getting infatuated to someone else. I am talking about the genuine love. I did! So what? Will you lynch me? I didn't know you cook so well, uncle! Only when my wife is out of town. Come soon, Radha. Your dad's a bank manager, right? Why are you being sarcastic? What's with your family? Do they grill everyone who comes home? Do I look like I'm about to rob a bank? What? Did you get worried when he asked you about your wedding plans? I can wait until you're ready. Okay? Do send me a photo once you wear it. Where are you, Satya? This place sucks without you! Don't hesitate if you need anything. You are important to me. How are you? Thanks for inviting me. It wasn't me. Arya invited you here. What did you expect? What else were you expecting? Do you think we would become a happy family? I am not angry with you. I don't have any affection towards you. You're just a stranger to me. I'm going to treat you like every other guest! I don't care if you don't reciprocate! If there's anything you need, please don't hesitate to ask. I need a revolver. What's with you? Why are you angry? Why is Satya here? She's here? Where? Don't act as if you don't know. Did you invite her? She's at the hotel. So, what if she's here? Poojan must have called her. I did tell you they were friends! Did you tell her we broke up? No. I did not! I never believed that we broke up! Don't try to be innocent. Stay in your limit. You can smile now. Please. A little more. We have dance practice in the evening. Remember? What? Was that just a drunken text? No! Not at all! Please drop me at the airport! I messaged you as I wanted you to be with me. You should have told me you were coming! I would've come to the airport. I wanted to surprise you. I am just a bit shocked. And a little hungover! You did the right thing. I don't think anyone wanted me here! Did you tell Radha about us? Yes, I did. I saw her in the lobby. She gave me the cold shoulder. You can make anyone insecure. -Liar! -It's the truth! Your nose stud... the eye shadow, you drive people into a frenzy! When am I meeting your mom? Soon. At the moment, she is just bothered about the wedding. What song are we dancing to? Come on! I can't dance! Stop bugging me guys! -You can't do that! -Krishna, look here! Oh, no! Why is she here? You're here. What's happening dude? I am in a shock! I'm clueless! -They want the full payment now. -Is he crazy? I am not making the full payment. You'll be fucked if we don't clear the whole payment! My sister's getting married. Should I leave the dance practice? How can I come now? How can I go? It's okay. You go ahead! We'll practice some other songs in the meantime. I'm sorry guys. I'll be back soon! Let's go dude! What is the matter with you? How many hints do you need? This is the most lies I've ever uttered in my life! Do one thing! Marry both of them! We'll find a legal loophole for the same. My uncle is a lawyer! Are you seriously thinking about this? Dude. They say Karma eventually bites back hard. Loving two women is like challenging Karma to bite you! Don't be in a hurry to solve this problem right away. Stay calm until the wedding is done. Get it? I'll teach you a life hack. Keep it in mind! There's a thin line between comedy and drama! You're walking on that line now! Shut the fuck up! I'll punch you! That's not fair, man! Nonsense! And this is my father! Radha is a very good girl! -She speaks a lot about you. -She's almost a family member now. It's quite cold. Hey. What are you doing? Why aren't you picking my calls? Give that to me. Are you okay? You said Radha knows about us. She's introducing her father to your mom! How would I know, Satya? I told you that she is friendly with my mom. How can I ask her not to speak to her? Hey! Where's Krishna? He has gone to the bathroom. She hasn't moved on Satya! I'm just helping her! I can't just leave her! Just think about it! Here. You cannot avoid this function. Let's just dance for one song! It's time for the dance. What are you doing here? -Were you and Satya smoking? -No! I'm coming! I'll be there. What's her problem? She came to apologize to me. Why? She found out that we broke up because of her! Don't be so serious, Radha. She's about to cry! You're judging her because she smokes. We need to act mature about this. Hey! Satya! Come. Is the hotel convenient? Ask me if you need anything. Did you give it to me when I was eating? What can I say. Poor thing! We're performing next! -Come on. -You go ahead. I'll catch up! Hey! I am sorry. I will help you out. He's going to be of big help now. Come. I'm really sorry. Come here. I don't need help! Dear brother, you managed to escape from the function. Now I definitely feel like an orphan. What are you doing man? So, what's new? I got to know that you quit your job. What are you up to now? Why are you suddenly so interested in my life? The only reason I'm here is because of my sister. Get done with it so that I can drop you to the airport. You have a lot of hatred towards me, right? Do you need this baggage? Come on, spit it all out! Was your father with you when you passed your tenth class? He must've been there! Mine wasn't. Now he is trying hard to become my friend. You abandoned us when we were kids. I never knew if my father was dead or just nonexistent. He was never there for me! I went through a lot in my life. You get it? I didn't have anyone to advise me. I was just jumping around from one place to the other. Mom had to teach me how to shave! I'm sorry, son. I don't know what else I can say! You are answerable to a lot of things and not just to me. I didn't expect your mom to understand this! I'll always carry the guilt of leaving you! Ever since then, I have never been happy. That's why, Ayesha left me as well. Listen. Please understand me. You can at least thank me. I saved you the other day. I have been observing everything. Whom do you really love? Both! What? But eventually, you have to choose one of them. Don't take this excuse to butt into my life! Why are you angry with me for your faults? Firstly, I don't know your story. It's up to you to choose a girl... and leave the other one. But whatever you finally decide, make sure you are absolutely honest about it! Living with guilt is hard. When I was confused between two women... my father wasn't with me. The next time we meet... Come! I don't feel the same for you anymore. You're all mine. I just want you! Don't hurt her with the false hopes. She's really sweet.8 Feelings aren't predictable. You just need to be clear about it. He's a live example. Yes, Dad. I'll take care of it. I just stepped out. I'll be back after breakfast. I'll call you. You're cheating on me, right? I'll call you back. What are you talking about? He's cheating us, Radha! He's in a relationship with both of us. You said you were just consoling Satya at the function. Was I crying? Do you know what he told me? "Radha hasn't moved on yet. And I am just helping her out." He directly asked me to not attend the wedding and in spite of that, I couldn't figure it out. When I told you I was pregnant, you were still... in a relationship with Satya? So, falling into the pool was a part of your act, right? Just hear me out once, please! Who are you to me? I called you here. Will you please listen to me? Go on! What do you want to say? I came to tell you about Satya when you were in Bengaluru. Then you told me you were pregnant. What was I supposed to say? That's when all this started! By the time I realized that I loved you both equally, I had already lied to both of you. Don't you feel ashamed, Krishna? You're trying to justify now! I am in the most horrible state, Satya. Both of you will never look at me the same way again. Then, why am I telling this to you? Do you think you're doing us a favor? Are you going to have us all live in the same place? Or separate houses? Why don't you decide that as well? You wanted to break up because you couldn't handle long-distance relationship! I refused to let that happen! I saw my mother's spirit in you. I'm doing nothing in life, Satya. I'm not even sure what I want to do! But you inspired me to do whatever I liked with all my heart! How can you call yourself a bitch? Think about it. Both of you left me at some point! And since then I am landing myself in troubles. You have an answer ready for everything, Krishna. One of you might bring another guy here and say that you love us both. If I get the opportunity, I would want to be with both of you. But if I pick one over the other, the other one will feel cheated! Wasn't this cheating? I can never trust anyone again! Did you even think about me Krishna? I am saying this because I gave a serious thought over it. Your life shouldn't turn out like my mother's. I will not repeat my father's mistakes. Do you see the irony here? I hated a man all my life. It was my father. He was the one who made me realize my mistake. Can you imagine that? Losing people you love is hard. I lost two people at the same time. Everybody wants closure! But relationships aren't systematically structured novels! To have a perfect opening, middle and end! They either end way too soon, or way too late! And in cases like mine... KRISHNA AND HIS LEELA Does anyone have any questions? Actually, I have one! Do you think anyone will marry you after reading your book? You tell me. Would you? I'm in a relationship. I have a boyfriend! You can love two people! What motivated you to write this book? Honestly, I never thought I'd write a book! I never really had anyone to share my stories with. Mom doesn't talk to me anymore. My friends have gotten cordial with me. I had no idea how to vent out my frustration. I started writing a diary one day! Rukhsar read that diary and said... "Hey, it's an interesting read." She convinced me to publish the book. And... so we're here today. So, are you claiming that being in love with two people is cool? What's the message behind this book? I used to work in the IT field. Then, I started working at Rukhsar's cafe. And now, I wrote this book. I don't know what I'm doing with my life. So, I'm not trying to spread any message. I haven't even thought of writing another book. Also, I don't have enough life experiences. And yeah... loving two people at the same time... is not cool at all! Are you still in touch with both of them? Yes. We're good friends! In fact, Satya's getting married next month. That's kind of a reunion for all of us! In the process of writing this book, I often found myself thinking from the girls' point of view. Although, it's not in the book, I used to spam them with long, apology e-mails. So... is that all? Did you use real names in the book? No, I didn't. I named my characters after them. Quit showing off! Come on! I can't take his attitude anymore. I'll be waiting outside. Get my car. I am crazy, right? The only reason they have finally forgiven me is because of the book. I told you because I clearly knew what the situation was. Being their friend for life was the only solution. Will you marry me?
