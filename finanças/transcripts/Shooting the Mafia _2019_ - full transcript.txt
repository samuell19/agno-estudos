I began taking pictures when I was 40. At first, the pictures were terrible. As they got better, I slowly fell in love with it. I loved the way I could express myself with the camera rather than writing. It was the start of a love story. I loved being a photographer, showing what I'd seen, what I felt inside. The camera changed my life. I began to find myself. Before that, I wasn't a real person. Life's been good to me. I'm glad I have some fight left. I don't bow down to bullying or injustice. That'd make a good photo - that boy in the fountain. Photography is very important to me. It moves me. My work forced me... ...into another world I saw that the Mafia and political corruption caused so much poverty. There was a lot of Mafia in this neighbourhood. Perhaps they're still here. A poor kind of Mafia that did the bosses' dirty work, did their murders. I took some good pictures here of women and children. Wonderful. This woman had 3 children. One was a new-born baby. She was tired, she'd been washing the stairs. During the night, a rat ate his finger. She slept through the baby's crying. The next day, the baby's finger was gone. This picture's special to me. A few years after I took it, I got a phone call from the curator of a gallery. She asked me to take it down. A girl had come to the exhibition, recognized her mother in the photo and fainted. I said "Of course, take it down". The mother was a prostitute, these were her gay friends. She wasn't killed for being a prostitute. She'd started selling drugs. She'd broken the Mafia rules. She'd tried to go it alone. Letizia is a legend. A flash of red hair, bobbing up and down at rallies. She'd always cause a stir. For me, as a child, she was a powerful figure. She stood out in the crowd. When I first saw her archive, I was shocked. I'd always been afraid of her photos, but then I realised they are our history. I held a print in my hand. I looked up at Letizia. I knew I never wanted to leave her. The Mafia kills so does silence Thank you. Thank you for your life. There were times when fear took over. I don't want to think about pain. My photos of the Mafia, of the dead - I wanted to burn them. I could almost hear the plastic burning. I dreamed of burning my negatives, but I have no right. I want to take away the beauty that others see in them. I want to destroy them. Kids dream of being important. Perhaps being a killer is a game but it's how they hope to be powerful. The killer is a symbol for them. It was a man's world, women were subject to their rules. I was a happy child. Life for me was riding bikes, running happily around town, riding with my legs on the handlebars. One day, I went out in Palermo. It was the first time I'd left the house. The first time... ...a man... ...exposed himself and masturbated. I didn't know about things like that. I ran home in shock. I wasn't allowed out any more. They stopped me from living, from growing. I was stunted. My father forced me to stay at home. He took away my freedom. All my dreams were shattered like a china cup on the floor. Why do such small things make us suffer all our lives? That awful man in the shadows. To have a father who controlled your whole life. I couldn't even go on the balcony in case a man saw me. All fathers at that time were obsessed. They were scared of other men who'd take their daughter away. They sent me to the nuns, a posh school. I had to curtsey 8 times. That made me an atheist straight away. We women longed for freedom so much back then. We met on the street. I'd gone out for milk. He was wealthy, 8 years older than me. I thought I'd get married, be happy, have lots of kids, be free. I ran away with him. I was a virgin. His aunt came to check... ...the sheets She said "You'll do". She'd found blood stains. "You'll do". She told his whole family I was a virgin, taken by a strong man. Perfect. At 16, I married the first boy who asked me. I had lovely children but it was an unhappy marriage. I wanted to go to school. My husband wouldn't let me. I didn't want to be just a mother. If only he'd let me study. But he thought it wasn't proper for a young woman. I got ill. Mentally ill I had a kind of heart attack. I was suffocating. There was a lot of violence. When a man sees his wife wants to leave, he lashes out. I ended up in a clinic in Switzerland. They said I'd need to stay for 2 years because I was so ill. I became a restless woman. I started looking at other men. 1 man, 2 men, 50 men... It was my struggle to be somebody. To be a person with her own desires, breaking free from her old life. Letizia was beautiful. She attracted men like flypaper. We'd walk on opposite sides of the street so people wouldn't see us together. I'd pass someone who'd just seen her. She had this loose way of walking. She'd walk towards you. People would call out to her. Once, I passed an annoying guy. I barged into him. I could've got into a fight! So, Santi... How old were you? I was nearly 20. You were 19. I was this big whore. -No, you weren't. -How old was I? You were 32. We met in Rome. Letizia arrived with her girls. We started looking at each other. We connected immediately. I went back to Palermo with them. We were in a car. We shared a cigarette. Our first contact was a moist cigarette. Then we began holding hands in secret. It was... ...complicated. She made the first move. I hesitated. She made it happen. We met in secret. I was so jealous. She was living with her husband. They had a house by the sea. They'd have holidays there. I'd get there late at night. When her husband was asleep, she'd meet me on the balcony. Very... ...very difficult. My daughters were grown up. I wanted to change my life and just leave I began to take control of my life. I wanted to work. I went into L'Ora newspaper. I was lucky, it was August. Everyone was on holiday, they needed help desperately. Someone who'd do a bit of everything. I wrote some articles, it felt great. I remember... Look, he doesn't have a camera, just a light meter. We shared cameras. He hasn't got a lens. He doesn't have one either. Little by little, I realised... ...I preferred taking photos to writing. I didn't want to be a journalist. With photography, I could tell my own story. I could feel it rather than understand it. I could express myself. Letizia, as a young woman, was absolutely beautiful. Her beauty provoked you. When I first met Letizia, she was well known in this city. We'd all heard about her. Her husband caught her in bed with a lover. He shot him, but didn't kill him. For a short time, Letizia's life spiralled into chaos, But then she found her vocation. I was happy being a photographer, the first female photographer in Italy to work for a daily paper. I felt proud, I tried to do a good job. At first... ...I didn't think about the Mafia. I thought I'd photograph children, women, streets... ...anything but the Mafia. It happened straight away. Three days after I started, I witnessed my first murder. Your first murder... ...never leaves you. There'd been a murder in the countryside. I started shaking. I'd never seen that. When we got there... ...the body had been there for days. The smell was terrible. There was an olive tree. The wind was carrying the smell. I felt that the body might move. It didn't. This was the start... ...of a story that lasted 19 years at the newspaper in Palermo. I'd go out with my camera. The police and everyone always pushed me aside. I'd have to yell and embarrass them. I'd shout: "The TV are allowed in... ...men are allowed in, why not me?" It was only later that I got their respect as a photographer. One morning, there were 3 or 4 murders. It happened all the time. I was stuck in this city. We weren't together anymore, which made it... ...even harder. We carried on working together, which made things very difficult. I'm Sicilian, I'm still here. You wanted to leave too. I always wanted to leave but I never have. After 50 years, what are we to each other now? I was very moved when I saw you. I'm always moved when I see you. I often want to be with you, to share a bed with you, to hug you. You know? Yes but... we can't have that. We could do it in secret. We won't tell anyone. What remains... ...of our great love story? What's left? Well... We're here, aren't we? We're still here. We still see each other. We still have a relationship. We're like family. It's not all lost. We're like family. OK. True love... I don't know what that is anymore! Because things end. Love is a lie. Love is a swindle. A swindle. If it was true love, it would never end. I came to Palermo when I was 22. Letizia was 40. She was 18 years older but it didn't matter to me. Hey, Letizia. Hello. Come have a seat and relax. I've never been here before. Have a look around. It's really big. How's Palermo for you? It's heartbreaking. Heartbreaking? Because you're here for the rally? Things have changed. I'm reminded... ...of my old life in Palermo. All my emotions are tangled up here. All those memories come back to life. At times, there were 5 murders a day. Once there were 7, all in the same place. We'd never known a slaughter like it. It was civil war in Palermo. In one year, they killed about 1,000 people. Those years... ...were very painful. You could feel the oppression, the menace, one after another. It was unbearable. It was all too much. It was a dark, painful time. There was a bad atmosphere in the city. Every day, I thought they might shoot me. I got used to it, accepted it. They smashed my cameras. I was spat at. I got death threats over the phone. I got anonymous letters. It was good to be a bit crazy. It gave me courage. I am brave, I see that now. What do we fear? The unknown? Dying? It was dangerous out there, especially at funerals. At Mafia funerals, we had to take pictures of their friends and of the families too. They didn't want photographers there. A photographer is so exposed. At funerals, they knew who you were. It felt more threatening and dangerous. I'd set the focus and speed on the camera. Then I'd cough... ...so they wouldn't hear the click. For the first time, the Mafia is divided. The young Mafia is led by Luciano Liggio who's accused of many murders. Liggio has been in hiding for 14 years. His ability to avoid capture was legendary. Today that legend is shattered. Mr Liggio? What a good audience. People say that since your arrest in 1975 you've controlled the Corleone Mafia from this prison through your henchmen Riina and Provenzano. What do you say? How exactly? By what means? I remember Liggio saying: "Come, come". I have a picture of him doing this with that look in his eyes. "Come here, I'll kill you." Imagine how they felt, being photographed by a woman. Not just photographed, but by a woman. Mafia men were so arrogant. I remember Liggio. When he first walked into court, the policeman looked like the criminal. Liggio, pulling the cop behind him. Chained together. Liggio walked in front, his head held high. He looked like the boss of the court. I was shaking. Only one shot isn't blurred. I was trembling taking all the other photos, not with fear but emotion. Those bosses exuded such cruel power. I was confronting them. It was terrifying. If he could, he would have killed me. Liggio is a bandit, a killer. He does the dirty work himself. He never leaves any witnesses alive. At first, it was Mafia killing Mafia. Later, they killed men from the establishment. Did anyone see who shot Judge Scaglione? No? No one saw anything? Did you hear gunshots? I did. I thought they were shooting birds, they do that sometimes. That's all it was. Were you here that morning? Not at the window, I was in bed. I have a nervous condition. First they killed Judge Scaglione. Then it was one after another, it was too much. We'd tune in to the police radio and rush there by moped or taxi. They murdered Judge Costa near the newspaper office. I ran, cameras swinging around my neck. When we got there, we thought he was dead. He was still alive. It was all devastating. It was a terrible time. It left deep wounds. Life for us... ...photographers, journalists, police... ...life was no longer... It's never the same. You can never be truly happy when you've lived through that horror, the pain of those left behind. Photographing trauma is embarrassing. You love these people, but you have to take photos. I couldn't tell them I was doing it with love. I look through my photos and see the name 'Letizia' on them. I don't remember taking them. Death isn't frightening. It's worse for the killers than it is for the victims. If only people realised, the killers suffer, not the victims, they might stop doing harm. I can't stand people stepping on my toes. What do you do? I don't tolerate it. If they don't stop? I tread on theirs. What should I do? Turn the other cheek, like Jesus? Where would it end? How many cheeks would I need? Those molluscs think they can become men by attacking me. They're the dregs, the bottom of the barrel. Molluscs, homosexuals. Dumped by their wives. They think they can be real men if they attack Liggio. Corleone is a farming town 60km from Palermo. 15,000 inhabitants, 3,000 are unemployed. There's a hidden menace that paralyses everything. You learn more about Corleone from the graves in the cemetery. No one has ever counted the disappeared. If someone disappears, it's not reported to the police. Everyone stays quiet. This is the law of the Mafia. And the misery of Corleone. One Sunday, we took my Mafia photos to Corleone. People were strolling around - mostly men, a few women. We showed our photos. There were photos of the Corleone Mafia like Liggio. It was very scary. You could feel it all around you. They call it "The Code of Silence", I call it fear. Everyone left the square. We were left alone with the photos. Was it hard to set up this exhibition? That was the easy bit. They're photos taken over 5 years. We wanted people to see them. Have you had any problems? No, none. Just our own fear. Have you got over it? Yes, but these are desperate times. I can feel the violence on my skin. We face it every day. Showing photos here is terrifying. There were times when we'd get home, we'd drive twice around the block before we parked in case someone was waiting for us. It was difficult to be lovers... ...in that world. We were wrecked. Often we'd just hug and fall asleep. We were so sad and disillusioned. That's yours. That's yours. That's mine. No, no. That's mine. That's mine. The relationship wore out. I left L'Ora newspaper. I got into politics. I was less involved with him, more detached. We'd been together 18 years. He wanted other things. I could tell. I cried, it was painful. He was so young, he had to explore. There was no bitterness. When you left, did I make a fuss? No, there was a lot of pain. We cried. Shall we say goodbye? Yes. I tried to get over the pain of Franco. I had to rebuild myself. I did it on my own. I look at my photos, it's just blood, blood, blood. I wanted to get more involved. I decided... ...not to give up taking photos but to get into politics. I think it's so important... ...to have a good political class. I was no one. But I was an honest woman. I wanted to build a better society. Letizia Battaglia, Green Party councillor. I'd like to take this opportunity to appeal to young people who take drugs If only they could stop. My daughter was an addict, I know how hard it is. She got clean. If only they could stop, we could end all the trafficking, crime and violence. A restless woman like me is bound to damage her daughters. My relationship with them was so hard. You're never good enough. Never give enough. You never get enough back. It's tough. I could talk about it but... ...I don't want to. Being in parliament was the worst time of my life. I did nothing and was paid a fortune. Everything was decided elsewhere. The Mafia was still there. We loved Falcone very much. He was a modern hero. Falcone said: "Follow the money and you'll find the Mafia". That's how he brought hundreds of Mafia to court. We're at the courtroom in Palermo. This is coming to you live. 3 hours ago, the first great Mafia trial began. There are 474 defendants ready to plead their case. One of the most notorious, you'll see him in a moment. We've had a few problems but here he is. Luciano Liggio has spent most of his life in jail or in hiding. I didn't want to go. It was my duty as a photographer but I didn't go. I couldn't face the horror anymore. There were hundreds of Mafia there. I didn't want to look at them. Tommaso Buscetta's arrival shatters the defendants' hopes. Buscetta, an informer known as "The Boss of Two Worlds". His evidence destroys the Mafia's defence. He gave away the Mafia's secrets to Judge Falcone. He's known Mafia bosses for 40 years. Who were the members of the Commission? All regional bosses are part of the Commission. Each boss is elected by three families. So they decide who to murder? Absolutely. The Commission decides who to kill. The head of the family would never murder anyone without consulting his regional boss. I've been in solitary since 1977 through no fault of my own. I don't see how I could've asked anyone to carry out these absurd orders as you're suggesting. In the name of the Italian people, the court of Palermo... ...according to the law, declares that Agate Mariano, Alberti Gerardo, Alfano Paolo, Bona Alfredo, Bona Giuseppe, Brusca Bernardo, Calo Giuseppe, Canisero Francesco, Castronuovo Francesco, Catalano Onofrio... The court is now closed. Totò Riina, boss of the Corleone Mafia, was still in hiding. He went crazy after his Maxi trial's life sentence. He planned a terrible revenge against Palermo and our judges. Riina's allies, the politicians in the government, plotted against Falcone. His security was cut back. He was in more danger than ever before. You're sacrificing yourself for the State. What does the State mean to you? There aren't many ways to describe it. It's not about the State, it's society. What kind of world are you fighting for? I'm fighting for a society where these things don't happen any more. They constantly attacked him. You can't imagine how viciously the press, both local and national, went for him. I'd say, "Let me take a good photo of you". He'd reply: "They'll accuse me of self-promotion". "Take a photo of me when I walk past". I didn't just meet him when I was a photographer. In his last years, I was a politician. Once we went to see him on an official visit. It was lovely, he's so sweet. We kept telling him "They'll kill you". He'd say "Don't worry". "If I die, others will take my place". It was a Sunday. I was at my mum's. She was ill. They interrupted the TV programme. Something had happened on the motorway. I called Franco... ...and told him to go there. I couldn't go. I didn't have the strength. I called a taxi and went to the hospital. They said he was wounded. He died later. I waited for hours for Falcone and his wife. She died too. An attack in Palermo on Giovanni Falcone. The Mafia has killed him. He's been killed while driving over a tunnel on the motorway from the airport. A number of bodyguards have also been killed. His wife is gravely injured. They've killed Giovanni Falcone whose fight against the Mafia was his life's work. Giovanni Falcone was about to become Special Prosecutor. He was once the most protected magistrate in Italy. The men from Cosa Nostra have slaughtered him. I held him in my arms. Falcone took his last breath. I'd always known it would end like this. I couldn't take any photos. I didn't want to tell any more stories of blood. I loved Falcone so much. He was one of those really good people. I couldn't photograph him dead. Now I think "Why didn't I?" Why are you making me think about this? I don't want to. I realise now I've never been at peace. It's always been like this. My life... ...has always been a struggle. Shame. They're students. Those are colleagues of the bodyguards. Buffoons! Buffoons! They are struggling to control the crowd. I, Rosaria Costa... This is the widow of a bodyguard. ...for those who gave their life for the State, I ask for justice. I'm speaking to the Mafia who are in this church. You can be forgiven. I'll forgive you if you get down on your knees, if you've got the courage to change. But they won't change. To change... To change... They don't want to change! Rosaria Schifani - her husband was Falcone's bodyguard. She shouted at the funeral: "Mafia, kneel down and ask for forgiveness". I was lucky as a kid to be friends with Judge Falcone. We lived next door. We met again as colleagues to fight the Mafia. Without our friendship, we wouldn't have got through it or been able to carry on. I'll never forget the crowd in a vast hall. A man at the back was pacing up and down, head down. It was Paolo Borsellino. Alone, walking up and down. He wasn't really seeing anything. Up and down. My life has changed. The death of my old friend and colleague has really shaken me. A month later, I'm still trying... ...to get back to work. The pain has taken a huge toll. I was afraid... ...that after Falcone died, I'd give up. Luckily... ...anger has kept me going. This is an apocalypse. Two months after Falcone's death, the Mafia have struck again. This time, the target is Paolo Borsellino. Let's hope the attack didn't kill Paolo Borsellino, the intended victim. There are at least four dead. Any update? It's just been confirmed the body is Paolo Borsellino, killed by the violent explosion. His body, what's left of it, was found in front of the house. The police have just confirmed it's by the door where his mother lives. It's Paolo Borsellino. It's definitely him. It was a Sunday. I was at my mum's again. We heard a very loud roar. It was the bomb. I called a taxi and went there. I remember bits of bodies on the ground. All that was left of Borsellino was his stomach. I just couldn't take a picture of his stomach. I had my camera but I couldn't. I didn't even take a photo of the car on top of a tree. Thrown in the air, a car. The pictures I never took... ...hurt me most. I never took them, I miss them. I feel disrespectful somehow. I don't know. That's how it was. The city woke up from a dark dream that had lasted for centuries. People were at breaking point. Sicilians wanted a clean break without the Mafia. This is the real Palermo. They're the Mafia, the government is the Mafia. See how they're treating us? They won't let me into the church. Murderers! Murderers! Murderers! We are honest people. We want to honour our dead. They allowed this to happen. They're our dead, they died for us. It's our right to honour them. Borsellino! Just carry on. They've started to break through, the President is about to arrive. There's not enough police. Buffoons! Buffoons! President, it's us they're killing! You're all disgusting! Out of the church, you Mafia! The funeral ceremony is over. People are angry. The President is stuck in the crowd. Police are struggling to keep people back. They're trying to get out. It's awful. They're running to the door. Minutes ago, people were calm. The atmosphere's changed. Italy is waking up. It's people that count, we need to be heard. We want a big turnout at the march. There's more of us, we're the majority. The Mafia must go. Totò Riina was captured this morning. Totò Riina is ours. We were shocked when we saw Totò Riina for the first time. This shabby moron responsible for the murders of Falcone and Borsellino. This moron had devastated our lives, our country. Riina Salvatore... ..son of Giovanni... ..born on 16th November 1930. -In? -Corleone Have you ever heard of 'Cosa Nostra'? I've never met any criminals from Cosa Nostra. The question was, have you heard of it? No, I haven't. Ask someone else. Don't focus on me, Salvatore Riina, a poor farmer struggling to provide for his family. They could've arrested him earlier. They stopped him when it suited them. It was all a set-up. He still gave orders from jail. He ruled. I hate these photos. They're unbearable - a rock on my shoulders. This child witnessed his father's murder at a petrol station, he probably knew the killers, so they murdered him. It was the first time I'd seen a dead child. Murdered like a dog. They call themselves 'Men of Honour'. What honour? They even kill children and women. We mustn't be ruled by fear. Fear is a luxury we can't afford. I feel free because I'm free inside. We mustn't give in to cowardly men who kill in the shadows. The head of the Corleone Mafia, Boss of Bosses, Bernardo Provenzano... ...had been hiding for 42 years, no one could find him. He never uses a mobile phone. He uses 'Pizzini'. Bits of paper with instructions... ...are passed from hand to hand, from town to town. A slow but efficient system. A system invented by an evil genius. Bernardo Provenzano looked like a frail, old man. Such a cruel smile. So cruel. I've seen smiles like that before on people who never surrender. Many Mafia men live a hard life in hiding. They don't enjoy their money. But they have power. In Sicilian, they say: "Power is better than fucking". Give him the death penalty! I dream of a Sicily free of the Mafia. I yearn for it. I long to see it. Bastard assassin! I believe in the next generation. I really believe in what today's kids can do. It's nice when your work is appreciated but success tires me out. I prefer love. I thought I'd finished with love. I was happy with that for 20 years. No one loved me. No one had a kind word for me. No one made me feel at peace. I was fine on my own. Recently, I've met someone. It amazes me that we're in a relationship. I was 38 when he was born. I'd already lived a lot. Roberto loves transsexual people and cross-dressers. He loves them and me. I didn't want... ...a sexual relationship with a man. Our relationship is sexual, but we don't have sex. I'm interested in his mind. I was frightened by his pictures. I didn't understand his world. I felt I was falling into an unknown world. It's hard to explain. People are confused. I suddenly appeared in Letizia's life. People said "Who's this guy?" I have to be brave too. Imagine what people are saying. They talk about us. No one dares say anything to me. Not even my friends. I see it in their eyes. Giovanna, take it off. Take it off. Come on, drag it behind you. Walk by. Stop. Stop. I don't feel guilty. I know my behaviour hasn't pleased... ...my children, my lovers, my friends, but I'm not guilty of anything. I was committed to my work. I did my best. People who disapprove can fuck off. I'm going to live until my last breath. In my mind, I feel more powerful than ever. Stronger and more powerful. I think it's beautiful being this old. I don't miss anything. My mind is sharp. I'm not afraid of the end. I'm so strong. I'm not afraid of the end.
