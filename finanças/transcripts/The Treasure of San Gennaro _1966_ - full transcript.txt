Do you hear the words of Don Vincenzo? Give everybody a pack of cigarettes. Certainly. Thank you! Goodbye.Goodbye. Vincenzo, don't you recognize? l think, you're Jack. Yes. What a coincidence! l thought you died long ago. What are you saying,Vincenzo, no. You know how we met? ln the battlefield. l served in the tank units. We'd hardly entered Naples, when he captured my tank in a moment. He's a valiant soldier. No, he's a great thief. He paid me a compliment. lt has been 20 years.Who is this sweet signora?

But l have money. l'll pay any amount to get you released on bail. l am happy with everything in here, l feel comfortable. l live just like at home. Everybody loves me, respects me. Say my answer is no. Vincenzo, l've come a long way from America for this. We're friends, right? And l was sure you'd help me. Sure, we're friends. Youth doesn't worth shit nowadays, Jack, nothing at all. But still l think you'll find a couple of guys capable of doing something. Yes. l've got the appropriate man for you. Wait. Gaetano! l need to make a phone call. Sorry, Don Vincenzo, but the warden is talking on the phone right now.. God damn him! He spends his whole life talking on the phone. One moment, please come closer. What's the matter? Are these Americans rich? Could they... Ok, understood, understood. Jack, l'm sorry. Gaetano gave me an idea. Since l'm also in charge of the administrative affairs here... You see, this year we've decided to whitewash the walls. Ok. Maybe you could donate ...? Got it, got it. 10 dollars enough? No. Hundred dollars we'lljust be perfect. Very much appreciated. Gaetano, say''thank you''to signorina. Thank you! What's the name of the young guy you were talking about? Armanducci Cirosoli or Dudu. He lives not far from me in theTofa alley. Tell him l sent you. ls he gifted? A great specialist.Once he even managed to clean out a bus with foreigners... ...while they were looking at the smoke over Vesuvius at the window. There's no any smoke over Vesuvius. Before that he lit a fire there, with firewood. Help yourself! Please, help yourself! Please, help yourself! Help yourself! Please! Excuse me. Please, please. Please, try it. lt's very tasty. Thank you. Buy, Signor, buy! 500 lire. What's this? Neapolitan air. No, no, go away. Neapolitan air, only 500 lire! Signorina, buy. Neapolitan air! Sorry, signorina. Signorina! Girl! Miss!

Not bad. And did you add whiskey in here? 20 percent. You could at least add 25, or else we're just completely deceiving people. Baron called one hour ago. What does he want? There's a premiere on Saturday. He was asking if you'll be coming. What is the opera? ''Rural cavalry"' Any noble guests? No, a usual premiere. Then l'm not interested. l go to the opera only in winter, when women have fur and jewels on. Apparently, this is the American. Where shall l see her to? Here, to me, where else. Coming! Come in, please. He does not bite. Look out, there's a step. Please.This is Dudu. Welcome! My name is Maggie. A beautiful name. Do you speak English? No, that's all l know. Concettina!

Don Vincenzo named Phenomenon. l want to talk about business. Let's have a drink. Cigarette? Thank you. Not at all. Where did l lose my lighter? You dropped it, Signora. Thank you. Get out of here and shut the door behind you. So, you've come here to get a tan? How do you like our beautiful Naples, like it? l didn't come here for that. Concettina! What do you want? Our guest wants a drink! Perhaps you'd treat her? Did she come here to drink? Get a Coke! We don't have it! We don't have Coca Cola. Well then ... ... let's go some quiet place where we can talk about business. With pleasure. l'll change my clothes immediately. And this is my mother. To say precisely, my nurse. She is very beautiful. Do it treated? Now he brings hookers into the house. Take this, Concetta. This American is the next in his collection. Concettina, said goodbye to signorina. l'll be happy to do it in the next world, l'll put a candle on her grave. Sorry, this is my fiancee. We've been in love for 2 years. Very nice. Have a nice walk, Dudu! Good day, lsabella! Hello, Dudu. Hey, baby. You're growing up hourly. So what did you want to talk about? lt's a very interesting affair. lf it is just as interesting ... ... as you are, then l'm all ears. So. Brush. Thank you for the American medicine, Dudu! Forget it. lt helped me, and Rafayel, too. Rafayel, how are you? Fine. Get well soon. Today we have a great weather the sun. Thanks, l've already been told about it. So what this is all about? Better talk to my friends. Remember, l'm pretty expensive. ln liras? Since we're talking, then in dollars too. Sorry, Dudu, l didn't see you! Okay, okay. Hello, Dudu! Hello. And where are they, your friends? The one who's quarreling, it's Jack. Give me back my money, rascal! Give me back my money! l'll bush his mug in. Jack!This is Dudu. What happened? He is a crook. Perhaps you are mistaken? l'm not, he robbed me! He put on the wrong card. Perhaps this game requires more attention? How much did you lose? He cleaned me out for 200 dollars. Let's play another $200, we'll try to win back. l agree. Come on, Pasquale. Please, follow the marked plate. lt's easy. Here it is. Here it is.One, two, three. Where is it? Where is it? This one is fine for Signor. No, this one. Are you sure? Open. You see? l've got the red one. Count the money. ls everything here? No, 20 dollars are missing! This is the compensation for the waste of time. l'm supposed to make a living, Signor. He's right. Okay, okay. Damn! So you're Dudu? At your service. Dudu, we rented a villa.Come to see us tomorrow, we'll have a drink and discuss everything. Why sit at home in such weather? lt's better afloat.The fish will never overhear. l'll be waiting at the pier Mardzhelina at 10. We'll go yachting. Do you have a yacht? No, but there are so many of them. Oh, Dudu, meet Frank. Frank, meet Dudu. Hello. Why is he confused? He has an ulcer. And l thought it was a consumption. See you tomorrow. Bye. Ciao. lf you don't have plans for the evening yet... Now that's a voice! Why did you throw it away? lt's one of the best Neapolitan songs! Dudu, everything's planned to the details. Plan, scheme we have everything. Frank prepared in 3 months. l can see that. lt is for people, but we don't amateurs in this case. How much will you take... ...for your services? This is not my business, l'll do it just for the sake of friendship with Don Vincenzo. Will you agree for 5 million? lt will be nice to get 10. For the sake of friendship with Don Vincenzo. But signorina, what can be more expensive than the true friendship in this world? Okay.Want to get an advance? We'll settle accounts later. You'd better worry about Sciascillo. ls he a murderer? No, he's kind of secretary for me. What's in there? Fish. Got you, you caught it with the net. Any questions? l would like to know what exactly this is all about. l can't say that, it's not your business. Why? Don't you trust me? Can you keep secrets? Just like a grave. Me too. Then consider that l do not want to know. l'll give you people, a driver... ...two cars with clean numbers, and the rest is your business. Shall we dance? With pleasure. When do you think to arrange the operation? On Thursday. l can't do it on Thursday, l must go to a wedding. Do you want me to postpone the raid because of the wedding? The granddaughter of his nurse is getting married. l don't give a shit who's marrying whom. l told you, on Thursday! Okay, we'll think of something. Good.Who are your men? Well, first of all, the Baron. Baron is an exceptional guy. There he is. He's sick, why do we need him? Dudu, what an honor! Baron, come to me tomorrow. We've got some business to do, are you in? Yes, if we can do it till the end of the month. On the 30th l'm going to Stockholm for the Congress. l don't want to miss the opportunity l have never been to Sweden, and they also pay well. Are they going to operate on him? No, it's just that his heart is on the right side... He makes his living by being shown to students. Now we'll find Agonia and the Captain. Call him. Agonia! Agonia, get down! There is an important business, faster. Now l can't do it right now. Dudu sent me. Where's he? Standing over there. Wait for me. Excuse me, signora, l have just had a misfortune, l need to go. And will he cope with the horses? You bet, he won so many races. Go! Easy! What's the score? Come on! Go, go! Well done, fellows! Captain, go down, Dudu's calling you. Can't Dudu see what's going on? Wait a minute, now we have to score the fifth goal! Well, do it! Go, Napoli! Concettina, no one should go in there! Let me go! l can't. l was told not to. He is with American, l will kill them both! l've already told you, Dudu is working. You're lying! Liar! So you don't believe me? No! Come and see. Well, are you convinced now? Yes, that you're a vile sycophant! These are Japanese instruments. Frank is one of the few people in America who knows how to use them. Dudu, mother is preparing eggplants, and sent me to ask... ...what would you prefer to eat them with, anchovies or cheese? Eggplants? l understand. l'll tell her so. That was Concettina, my fiancee. lt was nice to meet her. Let's continue the discussion of our plan. Yes. Sit down. Dudu. Yes. ls Sciascillo on guard? Yes, standing behind the door. Are you sure? Yes. l'll give him a thrashing! Let's continue.There are two ways. One of them is through the underground, the second one goes on top. Both groups will keep in touch with each other... What lovely lips she have! And her skin is like porcelain. Both groups must start at the same time. Clear? es yes The captain and Agonia obey Frank. Good day. Hello, Salvatore.Go ahead. Our object is here, in the area circled in red. Near the cathedral. And did you take into account that it's also near the police station Don't worry, we will take care of that. How? Well, we're not going to send them flowers, are we? ln America, we managed to handle much more serious situations ... That was in America. Salvatore, did they get you? lt is still unknown. Who is he? Oh,just nobody. A cousin of my mother's godmother. Don't pay attention, go on. No. Yes. We'll meet where we arranged to, at 1:00 a.m. At 1:00 a.m.okay? At 1:00 a.m.? At 25:00. How shall l get there? On a trolleybus. ln my neighborhood trolley does not go. Hey, quiet! One question: how shall we dress? What? Nothing.Baron, and do you want to wear a tuxedo? No, l'm just interested. Sometimes the costume plays an important role. Silent. At 1:00 am? And what are you going to do about the people from the street? But at 1:00 a.m. people are sleeping peacefully. That's in your country. And in ltaly in such heat.... ...some people sleep on the streets. And if you want Naples to become empty, just let me know, and l'll do it. How? Baron, when is the Festival of Neapolitan songs opening? On the 24th. l already got a ticket. Festival Songs? And what do we got to do with that? Postpone the raid on a day later, on the 24th. At what time will our ship be sailing? On the 25th. No, that's impossible. We'll do it on Thursday. You're the boss. So, every one of you has a precise task. Nothing's left to chance. Everything should work like clockwork. Frank is responsible for the technical side of things. Synchronize clocks with Frank's watch. l had a watch on a chain, but l had to pawn it. l have the quittance. Perhaps, our organization wants to buy them back? Agoni, what time is it? Don't know. Sorry to interfere, but l heard that you need an accurate clock. l have a large selection, with guarantee. Antimagnetic, shock resistant, in a steel casing... ... in a gold plated casing... No, l don't need that!This is intolerable! Get out! Dudu, kick him out! Who are they? Why are they at the meeting? Out! Pasquale, this is no time. Out! Where's the hat? l threw it out. What kind of manners? We only wanted to help. Come on, let's go. Throw them out! Jack, do you need me? Can l be of any help to you? No! No one can help me! Well. For God's sake!You must learn that the absolute mystery... ... is the keystone to success. You are obliged to keep your mouth shut. Not a word to anybody. Neither to your mother, nor the bride, nor father, nor brother, nobody okay? Don't worry, Jack. Where were we? Yes, in the area, surrounded by a red circle, there is an object X. You'll learn about in good time. l'm sorry, l found out that you're planning... ...a big operation. And l've just hurt my hand and need money for the treatment. Can l be of any help to you? Sciascillo! Where's that idiot? Who let you in here? l'll kill him! l'll kill him! Sciascillo, where are you? l'm here. l'll kill you! Come here, blockhead! l'll kill you! Come here! Hurry, hurry! You forgot to turn off the light. Who will drive the car? Baron was supposed to, but he sat there. Sciascillo, you drive. Baron, change the car! l didn't understand who is supposed to sit where. Do you think they remember your instructions? l hope they do. Attention! What's that? We're in the area ''B'' . ln 3 minutes we'll be in the area ''F'' . Operation will start in 1 1 minutes. Ok, l can read you well. Over. Dudu, can you give me a lift? You're going to Sanita, right? No, l'm going in another direction. And where are you going? Tomorrow you'll learn about it from newspapers. Neapolitans are so curious. Whatchamacallit, please, stop. What is it? l'll be back in a minute. Drive after him. Get out. Get out! Where's your friend? Don't know.But since he said he'd be back... ...he will be. Let's go after him. Let's go! Hurry! Hands off,just keep your hands off!. Stay still, Dudu. Nobody moves! Everything's OK, l'm coming. Let's try again. Fiance stirred. Attention, shoot! What a pleasant surprise, Jack! Thank you for coming here... at this modest family celebration. They set you free? Yes, l was released. Young people wanted me to personally visit this solemn occasion. l asked Gaetano to accompany me. He is still young, his work is boring, and he needs to have some fun too. What a nice young man! No, signora, l can't.Thank you. Please, to the table! Don't offend us. Mom, we can't, we must go. You just came and already going to leave! Sweetheart, l have work to do. May l? Of course, help yourself. Thank you. This Geranino, accountant and a gentleman. Nice to meet you. Me too. Don Genaro Esposito, his wife and mother in law. My cousin. Her friend. Daughter in law.Cousin and his sister. Nice to meet you. Here is our family attorney. Which part of America are you from? United States. And my brother is from Detroit. You'll get to know the others yourself. Look how many people are here, and they are all my friends. This is my friend Jack.And here is our fiancee. l wish you a good son! Who he will be, we'll know in a month. And what is this? This are mussels.They're cooked, try it. Very tasty. l kept this bottle from Dudu's birth! Thank you. Signor American, try it? Thank you, he doesn't like it. No, thanks. Thank you,l'm touched. ldiots! Attention, Don Vincenzo wants to name the pledge. Quiet, please! Now... ...when the young are taking pleasure... ... making themselves comfortable in the marital bed... Don Vincenzo, they have already made themselves comfortable and have already taken pleasure. Don Vincenzo, spread the toast. Jack, maybe you want to say something? No! Dudu, your one minute has been going on for two hours! We must go.Come on, Maggie. Come on, Frank. Frank, let's go! That's OK. He'll be fine. A little indigestion. Poor Frank. Things are bad, Maggie. We can even say it's over. Frank's gone, and those five idiots take us for a ride. We can turn these idiots into our friends. Why not tell to them about the case and did not share Frank's offer? What? Give 30 percent to these idiots? You can only promise to. And then we'll see. Please, accept our firm's sympathy. Will he be OK? At 2 o'clock in the afternoon they'll put him on the plane, and tonight he will be in America. Do Signors want to say goodbye to him? Yes, yes. This is the first time he will be flying with a real passport. Poor guy. Where did he get this ring? He bought it in London 10 years ago. He always said he did not want to die in powerty. l hope he will be happy to take 20 thousand into the grave. Well... ... 10 years have passed... ... Now the ring is worth all the 30 thousand. Please, accept condolences from me... ...and all the residents of poor neighborhoods. Did they deliver the wreath? Yes. Don't, let's go. Cigar? Do you have any cigarettes? No. Thanks. Dudu, we need to talk. Farewell Frankie. This is a serious loss. Everything was prepared. Are we going to cancel the raid because of Frank's death? You can't bring him back to life. Yes. He was an excellent technician, but there are other talents. Sure. Dudu. Yes? lf you find a replacement to Frank,... ... l'll give you his share. Captain. Here in Naples, he will be better than Frank. OK, OK. And if we manage to do it, l'll give you 30 percent. 30 percent of what? From 30 billion. You said $ 30 billion? Yes. Where will you get 30 billion in Naples? San Gennaro. TheTreasure of San Gennaro. 30 billion lire. l have heard nothing. l am very sorry, Jack. So, what's your answer? l won't do this, though we are friends. Sorry, Maggie. Hello, Dudu! Hi, Lucia! She'a a very hard working girl. ln the afternoon she embroiders in the monastery, and in the evenings works here. You know, Dudu, l don't understand you. Such a professional, and suddenly... l became a professional thanks to the patronage of San Gennaro. l am, in fact, an orphan. My mother is Austrian... ... she was a ballerina. And l never had the pleasure to know my father. My mother was a beauty.Want to see? Yes, of course. Here she is. Which one? The fourth on the left. This one? And maybe the fifth. The fifth is beautiful too. They are all beautiful. ''To my Vitorio with love from Martha"' With great love. Vitoria is your father? No, he was their choreographer. Having abandoned me to my mother, she left with him. So l was alone in this life. And it is a difficult thing.When l was 15, l earned money at the road near the Mount Vesuvius... ...where the trains slow down, l was shouting ''Help!'' and tearing the hats off those... ...who were looking out to see what's happened. Once l tore the hat off Don Vincenzo, and my life... ...changed dramatically. l found a father and teacher. Now everybody respects me. lf it were not for San Gennaro's help... ...would l've managed to come so far? And don't you want to come further? Where? l don't know. At least somewhere with less people. Let's go. And where did Jack go? Ciao, Lucia! Ciao, Dudu! We lost Jack. Hello, Sergeant.Want a drink? No, thanks. He was the first one to arrest me. Hey, Jack! Come on, Jack! Get out, l like it here! Let's leave him. They probably gave him my whiskey. Some assert that the strength of the woman is in her beauty. That's not true. Beauty is a good thing, but it's not all. America is operated by about a thousand of old women... ... but each one of them has a bag of money in the bank. You, ltalians, sleep on the left or on the right side? lt doesn't matter, Maggie, whatever is more comfortable to you. l also want to become rich, but earlier than l wizen. And what will you do? First l'll leave the barbershop. And men will stop calling me ''baby Maggie'', patting me on the ass. lt is ridiculous to hear that you've allegedly achieved much and everybody respects you. You just puff that now you're higher than the others on two fingers, and that's all. But it takes only to go beyond the block, and you're nobody. There's not the great Dudu anymore. You imagined yourself to be the King of Naples. Don't you think you imagine too much? Hat thief. Here in Naples every hat thief is a King. Maybe l am wrong. But by putting 15 million in the bank, you would become king. People would even forget that you've been in jail. lmagine: the director of cabaret is rude and you throw him out. You're not satisfied with a policeman, you replace him. You live as you want. You're the master.You appear, and people applaud. And all because they respect only the money. By carrying out this raid, we will become the masters of the world. Help me, will you. lt's mad, so much money, 30 billion lire! With them there's so much you can do! Just think. Do you think this face is worth 30 billion? Yes. Come to me, Dudu. That's enough talking about money. Open your mouth. Sorry, Maggie. You made me doubt. You know, as they say in Naples? ''Where there is love, there is no doubt''. l wasn't spying, Dudu! Mom Asunta forgot on what number to put in the lottery:... ...on 44 or 48. She sent me to Mary Rose to know whether she remembers. She told her about that dream. l missed the last trolley bus and walked to the villa. When l saw your car, l decided to wait for you in it. l wasn't spying! Shut up, Concettina, l need to think. You don't love me anymore. lf you did, you'd gave me a slap in the face. l will resettle the poor from Sanita, Polonetto, Forchello areas to Vomara area. ln the sun that they don't see now from their basements. l will build for them nice apartments with all conveniences. Only decent people will live there. l approve. Action. Night Cabarets, palaces ... ...swimming pools with the view to the sea. And if l may, l'll put ... ...your statue in the center of the park. Armando, don't show off. l think the bust will be enough. But all this will require about 200 300 millions. lf not more. And how much... ...does San Gennaro have in the sacristy? Over 30 billion. Strike me blind, God! So San Gennaro is a billionaire? That money just aimlessly lie there. l'll bring them to life. And when l walk in the street, everybody will take their hats off. Armandi, why hats? They no longer wear hats. They'll be coming to me from television for the interview. When l'm asked whether l agree... ...the law on divorce, my answer will be no. Why? For no special reason. Do you approve the plan? You know, Armandi, l like your idea of the resettlement of the poor in the sun. That's a good thing! lt is a pity that such thoughts occur to a rogue and not to the mayor of the city. My concern is whether the money will stay in Naples? l wouldn't want them to sail out of your hands across the ocean to America. l haven't left anything to chance, l'm not a fool. Armandi, remember ... ...what you said when you were4. No one could understand what you were babbling. And do you understand now? Generally. lt is necessary to know the opinion of Gennaro. After all, if he takes offense, will cease to perform miracles. And you know, people in Naples can't live without miracles. ln your opinion, l will have to give up? No. This is a delicate issue. Tell me one thing. Yes? What are your relations with Gennaro? What do you mean? Did you ever... ... insulted him? No, what are you saying, l am a pietist. That's good.Then go to him ... ...and have a man to man talk with him.Tell him everything. And if he approves your plan and makes it clear that he agrees ... ... l'll give you my permission.Clear? What a vile day! Let's hope that he is in spirit. l sent a postcard and 300 lire, as you said. So what? l did not win anything! And l need a washing machine. Put in a word for me! Excuse me, signora, there's an important matter. That's OK, you'll wait. l need to finish, l'm not finished.Yes, and my grandson... ...needs a scooter. He wants to live in style, help him win the lottery. Do you understand? Don't let me down. l don't play pranks again. Now l've finished. San Gennaro, you know my request. lt's been so much talked about, that it's probably dining in your ears. You are saint and should read minds. ln the past l've done things that won't be pleasing to you.. Forgive me, l won't offend you again. l said honestly.What happened, happened. Here l am... l came to talk man to man. You know they love you in Naples, respect, honor... ...and for that you perform miracles. But, l think, in other countries they know very little about you. l don't mean they don't reckon with you, but there are saints known more. Cities are named in honour of them. For example, San Maria, San Francisco, San Trapez. With all due respect, we are obliged to get round them. But to do so we need to accomplish something great. Approve my plan, San Gennaro, and you will become the most important saint. The first saint in the world! Gennaro, what do you say? What's he saying? l know you are very modest, but l beg you in the name of Naples, in the name of all...... ...who suffers the way you suffered, otherwise they won't made you into a saint. Give me the treasure, what do you need them for? You live well, you have everything. And on these billions we'll do something that everybody will envy. We'll construct a bridge between Naples and Capri, a park in the center. Eusebio. What? Eusebio. l'll buy you Eusebio. With him we'll win the Cup, and you will be glorified. You want that? But you must give me a sign, otherwise l can't be sure that you understand me. He doesn't answer. lf you disagree, say ''no'', don't feel shy. But think twice. The sun! The sun come out. And it stopped raining. Thank God! San Gennaro... ...l got you. Thank you. Stop, the candles. Oh yes, the candles. Gennaro, you're just a miracle. We're beginning our reportage from the Festival of Neapolitan songs. The first song:''There was such a day"' Authors Moresco and Pogano. Sings Pepino di Capri. Sergeant, if you want to listen, come in. Thank you, signora, but we're on duty. Could you please make it louder? Good evening, Sergeant. Wait a minute.Who gave you permission? What's in that box? Where is the socket? What does this mean? OK. Who sent it to us? l don't know. l have already delivered 50 of them. l'll end up having missed the festival. Here's the antenna, l'll turn on the sound now. Sign here. What do you think? Maybe it's from the Commissioner Guidi? Whom is it from? l don't know, but l can take it back. No, leave it. lf something's wrong, you'll take it back tomorrow. We must find out who sent it. Thank you.The pencil is mine. Enjoy the show! lt is necessary to configure it. Give me a hand here. Let's go. Over here, Captain. Hey, you! l'm talking to you.Come back. The house's in dangerous condition. And we live here. Ah, sorry. Wait for us in the car near the cathedral. Hello. Hello. Tonight there will be a suspicious traffic near the cathedral. Don Ferdinando, get me my almond's milk. Communication is in order. lf you see a policeman, leave the steering wheel and kiss her. Act like lovers. Attention! Attention, Agonia! l read you. At the place where you are now, one tunnel is going to the left... and the second one to the right. Look out, the water. Better late than never. The left tunnel is blocked by a steel door. Right. Take the laser and cut the door. Quiet. lt seems like the police. No. lt seemed to me. Captain, laser is a very sensitive instrument. Use it with caution. How great it cuts! Nothing special,just like a gas welder. Let's go. We left the steel door behind. Report the next position.Over. Speak, speak. l can't read you. l can't read you! Oh, l turned it off. Move back. We lost contact. Those dickheads don't answer. Stop, everything's in order. The second barrier is a walled tunnel. Here it is. Use the ultrasonic drill. Give me the rotator, how is it called. Ultrasound. l don't believe in this thing. Sons of bitches!These Americans are really talented. Give me the charge. Kiss, it's the police! l don't like it. Why is the police snooping around here? Dudu. Hey,Dudu! What? Go, take a look what's going on there. Yes. Everything's lost, there is a police car,just over the object, they'll hear the explosion! Captain, do you read me? Put out the fuse! lt's too late, it's already burning behind the wall. Step back from the wall for 25 paces. For 25 paces.Step back, immediately! We did. OK.Now go left. Look, there will be a staircase. Get out of the tunnel and ascend that, how do you call it? What's the ltalian for ''round hole in the ground''? Jesus. How is it called? Manhole! The main thing is to prompt in time. Get out through the manhole.Yes. Order.That way they'll be grabbed by the police. What's that for? They'll take them away and won't hear the explosion. Need help? No, thanks. Oh, Captain Vazili! Well, how are they singing? And you're going to sing for us too. Well, this is a misunderstanding. Blockheads, they took the suitcase with them! What are we going to do without the instruments? This is a misunderstanding. We'll find out. Let's go, maybe we'll be in time for the second section of the festival. Faster! Close the door, Paolo, there is a draft here! Dudu, where did you disappear again? Parked car. Again, an unexpected delay. What do we do now? Where's your Dudu? What shall l do? l'm not an electrician. Dudu! Hey, Dudu! Where's he? God damn it! Be careful, you might break something this way. You should've watched under your feet. l did, couldn't see anything! We have no instruments. How are we supposed to go any further? High voltage, not less than 10 thousand volts. Look. That's much more terrible than the electric chair. l'm finished if everything goes on this way. Can you be more careful? l have a method. l can try. What method? Put a ''crook'',just like on counters. What? l used it during the war. Thanks to that, almost no one in Naples paid for the electricity. Perhaps it will do. We will need more... lt should be something... Sorry. ls it tortoise? Yes. Then this is not an electric conductor. Let's check. And what if it rushes? What is it? Are you afraid? Go. Hands off, please. Hurry, ''crook'' doesn't last long! l can't see. Where? Down, under the wires. Come on, hurry, hurry. Come on! Sorry, it was dark. There's no time for decency. Maggie, take the sack. Go, l'll handle it.Take the lantern, Jack. Jack, take the lantern! OK. OK, my turn.Hold the wires. l'm holding. Hurry, Dudu, hurry! Dudu! l'll get you out, don't worry. Easy,just easy. Yes. Drag me slower. Dudu, watch your nose! OK, OK.That's enough! You were born with a caul. Let's go. lt was a nice tie. How long is it left till the end of the festival? We'll soon find out. What are they doing there so long? Who's singing? Maria Paaris. So, Gloria Christine... ... Mario Abatte, Serge Bruno, and it will be over. How will we pass through the wall? Let's try to undermine it. Where is the dynamite? Here. OK. lt's good that those idiots forget it here. What happened? Rat, rat! lt's just a mouse... ...signorina. Sorry, l thought... l'm sort of wired. Let's burn it. You better do it, Dudu. Yes, of course. And run away, the fuse is short. lncredible bad luck. We can't go through this wall. l have another one. No, it's a big risk. A charge of enormous power, and the cord is too short. lf you put the cartridge deeper, then the cord is not even enough.This won't work. But in my opinion, there shouldn't be a wall here. Give me the map. Give him the map. l can't find it.Apparently, l lost it. Lost? What are you talkin 'about!You had to watch better! What are we going to do without the map? As if you're not mistaken. What would you do, if we didn't have that simpleton Dudu here? Now, stop.You see, l'm calm. You asked me to hire him! lf l made decisions, we would have reached! You bet, you're so clever! Don't blame me! lt's your fault! Without you l would have robbed a bank in America! So what? You lost a lot of things yourself! And l should have lost you long ago! Leave in the ditch, where l found you! A where did l find you? ln a horrible garbage can! l supported you! l did not ask you! Remember how you begged me! And l also helped your mother and father! l got him! l got him, Jack! l got him! What is it? What else? The mouse. l'll tie the charge to that mouse. l feel sorry for her! lf it undermines the wall, you'll put it a monument. Now l'll push it into the burrow. Hopefully, it will run under the wall. Hey, go back! Close the damn door! Bravo, rat catcher! Thank you, silly Dudu. lt's Mario Abatte singing. We must hurry! Maggie, Dudu, finally, we are there! The map is accurate, these catacombs are near the crypt. Frank draw it accurately. But l don't see the passage. What makes you laugh so much? We won't be able to go back and there's no way forward! Jack, Maggie and Dudu. l don't see anything funny! Shut up! Jack lacks a sense of humor. Forget those stupid jokes and shut up! lt's not my fault you don't have a sense of humor. Stop it, shut up! We can't get out of here. These are the catacombs, and the walls here are thicker than they build them nowadays. Even dynamite can't handle them. You see? Come in! Push harder, it's not locked. l have been waiting for you. How did you manage to get here? l saw the keeper going away. He didn't shut the door, so l came in. Sciascillo, spit in my face. Come on, we don't have much time! We only need to break the glass. You can't break it. Look. l tried, but couldn't do anything. Why isn't it breaking? Stand back! Well, l told you. No! No, no, that simply can't be. l want them, l want them! Calm down, that's enough. Hold the lantern. Let me. This glass has a critical point. lf we find it, it'll be easy to break. ls there anyone on guard? Yes, the Baron. And why do you think we hired him? Come on, knock. Sergio Bruni, the last participant. We have 3 minutes left. We must get out of here while the streets are empty. No, you can't break it. Maybe l should try? Why do you think you can do it? Let's try. We have nothing to lose.And what if it suddenly breaks? You can look for that goddamn critical point 24hours. What a beauty! We are rich, we are rich!You understand? Careful, careful, don't break anything. Come on, put it all in the bag, careful. Hey, give me the lighter, it's mine. There's more. Sciascillo, here you go. What a beauty! That's it. Let's go. Hurry, hurry! Dudu, let's go. lt seems we have taken everything. Come on. Come on, Dudu! The cost of San Gennaro's treasure ... ... reaches the fabulous figure of 30 billion lire. 30 billion lire.30 billion lire. Don't worry, the treasures will remain in Naples. l thought l'd closed the door. That crook took 5 thousand to repair the lock. Someone will steal the treasures this way. Make way, Baron! Do you have the collision ready? They are near the intersection Foriya. They've been listening to the radio and now the battery has run down! Sciascillo, come here! Did they get you? During the accident they'll drag the bag away. Push. We've been flimflammed! Sergo Bruni's won! lt seems we had the similar idea. But you pass ahead of me. And you thought l was good for nothing. l never knew how to trisect. But l do this better. Hold on, you! Hopefully, they will go down this road. Don't worry, there is no other road. Go ahead, faster.. Damn, l don't see anything Sciascillo, take it off! What happened, Sciascillo? There must be an intersection now. They won't miss them? No. After the collision, they'll pounce at them. They're coming, coming! Will he give us a sign what car Dudu is in? Of course. Ready. Let this one go. Do it! Again you come home after midnight! Sciascillo, unhook the bed. l can't find the bag.Where is it? Moron, it's in the first car! Where to now? To the port.They were going to take the boat. lt seems we left them behind, l can't see them. Drive, why did you stop? Sorry, Jack, but l can't halve either. Maggie, are you crazy? l told you ... ... l'm pretty bad in division. Maggie, no, don't do it! What happened? l don't know. l heard a splash. l ran up, and saw a robe floating. So l called the police. Oh, mama mia, there's a dead man in the car! Poor girl. lt turns out the treasures fell to fish. Come on, l can't stand that. ls this the 17th drowned man in this year? 17th. Then we'll put on 17, 44 and 18. Yes. Don't put on 18, they haven't found the woman. Then we'll put on two figures. Right. Yes, that's what we'll do. God, the Blessed Virgin, what a shame, what a shame! Scoundrel! Renegade! How dare you rob San Gennaro? Oh, what a misfortune! You defamed me in front of the whole Naples, scoundrel! l hope you break paralyzed, diarrhetic... ... l hope you all burn in the frying pan in hell! l was allowed by San Gennaro and Don Vincenzo. l raised him like my own son, and what he repaid! l don't want to see you! l don't want to see you! Besides, you are not from Naples. Your mother was Austrian, and a whore as well! Mine too. Your mother was an Austrian? No, a slut. l hope you all have your hands withered! Don't swear. l'm not. lt's San Gennaro cursing you. l hope you fall ill with St.Vitus's dance (chorea) and dance all your life! May you turn yellow from jaundice! Mom, enough, that's too much. l'm sick and tired. San Gennaro didn't punish you because we are a bit related. Three people died, two were arrested. No, San Gennaro doesn't forgive! Doesn't forgive! Unfortunately, l must go. Baron, do you feel bad? No, l have a date.Say hello to Dudu. Fortunately, l didn't participate in it. But just in case, l'll go home and bed. The corpse of the American citizen found in the port suggests ... ...that the raid was the work of the gang from the western hemisphere. What is he talking about? Concettina, are you crazy? What time did you come home? Where did you spend the night? A pretty mess that shameless Dudu has made, and now you too! You'll end up like your father, in the madhouse. l will throw you out alive! A nice present my sister sent me! lt was the latest news. Are not you ashamed? Do you think l'll marry a girl, who disappears at night? l haven't done anything wrong, Dudu. l waited for you all night near the villa. You banned me to, but when l saw in the morning that American packing things into a suitcase... ... l thought that you'll leave with her. Now did you finally calm down? Only l love you, Dudu. Don't think about her. And who thought about her? Kiss me. Well, did you calm down? lt's over, she has left. And maybe not? She left. And did you see where? l won't say, otherwise you'll go after her. Me? What are you saying? Come on. This morning she called me with her when we met by chance. And you know what l answered to her? ''Dear Maggie, l love another''. Get into the train and go to America. The train? Train, steamship. Then why did she go to the airport. To fly away. Sciascillo, call the airport. Why? Ask about the plain. Darling, you love me? Yes! Find Tomaso at San Ferdinando theater. Let him send Kapadekino to the airport ... ...a car with the Vatican number and a man in uniform with decent mug like a cardinal. A decent car to San Ferdinando theater. No, Kapadekino!This is a matter of life and death. Kiss me. Later, now go. And not a word to mama Asunta! Yes. Too late, departing in 15 minutes. Call Don Vincenzo. How is that? After all, it's an American plane. Who can delay it? Are you sure? Can you check this quickly?Try. l'll try. Not sure, it's not easy. l'll try, Don Vincenzo. For 20 minutes, l can't promise you more. Attention, attention! Passengers departing flight 1 14 to New York... ...you are as... to the pla... l rep ... Passengers of Flight...exit number ... You can't drive through! What happened? The petrol is not received. Pepino! Pepino! What? A noser? Strange, 10 minutes ago, we got an excellent summary.OK, l'll clarify. Shall we take the stairs? We haven't got all day! We'll take off in 10 minutes. OK, Captain. There's a road reparation! Scared? Please, don't worry, this is just an unexpected delay. The plane will take off soon. Barbarian country! Yes, signora. Attention, attention. Passengers departing flight 1 14 to New York... ...asked to go to the exit number 8. San Gennaro be thanked, we're here! Where's the boarding to New York? Exit 8. Thank you. What do you want? Excuse me. There she is! Didn't you recognize her? The suitcases! There they are. Found? Yes! There they are! We need the white ones! lt's too damn dark in there. Oh, shit! How to get to the boarding? The jacket! Hold the jacket. Guys, enough of these jokes. Who took my hat? l'll find out whom you stole his jacket from. Let him pass, he's with me. We'll go to the commandant, let's sort this out. They're here! Empty! Stop! Hey! Suitcases opened, and everything fell out.Go pick it up. We must get her. She's near the plane. Unhook the carriages. Hurry, she's already getting into the plane! This puffer barely moves. Go. She got off! Sciasci, take that bag! Help! No, no! There is nothing here! Let me go, Dudu, let go! Let's deal in a friendly way! Let me go! No, you can't just take them from me! Scoundrels!They are mine, mine! What's going on? Scoundrel!Go away! They want to take something from her. Help! Oh, poor, poor, poor! No, don't you dare, no! Thank you.Take care, Maggie. She was mad, l'll go for the doctor. l kept my word, they will stay in Naples! Like a tigress! Became brutalized. Here's the machine. Sciascillo, hurry. Run! No! No, l'm not coming! San Gennaro will curse me! San Gennaro! Another crazy! l'm not coming! l'm not coming! Easy, don't rush. What is your name? Aloisio. Aloi, give me a cigarette. OK, now there will be a police post.Drive slowly. And you smile silently and bless. Understand? Do you know who it is? Archbishop Aloisio. Really? Did we pass the post? Yes. Drive onto the freeway.Today we'll already be in Switzerland... swap all this for currency and come back. Better draw the curtains, it's better that way. Draw it, Aloi. And you did you pin all that is necessary? Not very spruce. Everything as it should be. l was expecting an important cardinal, and you have such a view. Where did they dug you up? At the Cardinal's palace.A woman named Mama Asunta ran up... ...and told him how you risked to save our treasures. Thank you, my son. Dudu! Our hero Dudu! He saved San Gennaro's treasures! Dudu, you have done a good deed! My son, dear! Your Eminence, he's such a fine fellow! Holy Father, they really belong to all Naples. Yes, my son, it is so. San Gennaro, this is your necklace! Take it, San Gennaro! The end Subtitled by Fantomasko and Rafayeal 2009 December.
