More hot water, sir? Excuse me? For your herbal tea, would you like more hot water, sir? No, that won't be necessary, I'm... checking out soon. Surrender. Surrender to the moment. Hey. I'm not up to this. Not with a stranger? No, no, no, with anyone. My past-- No, my past isn't gone. No, and it's not here either. Yeah, that is why... I can't. You can't what? Live anymore? So how are you doing? Fine, fine. You? Good. Hi. Hi. What's your name? My name? Am I getting too personal? What happened here? What happened there? Exchange scar stories before we exchange names? Hmm. It was just one of those childhood things. I don't really remember how it happened. That is such a big scar, that must've been very traumatic. If it was, I'd remember it. Board it up, pulling out on the next stop. This is my stop. Is this where you live? This is where I get off. This is where I started from. This... This is where I live. That's good. This is the final boarding for all express and coach to Salem. All aboard. All aboard, please. Look. What happened between us was, uh... Was just... Was just what? You know. Just for the moment? Just one of those things... between strangers. Just one of those things? It's William, my name. It's William. Yeah, dignity. That's something that you wouldn't understand. What, Stoller? Are you a friend or something? The family's not gonna see it. The guy'd break up. Show him some respect. Okay. But you're in my shot. Shut up and shoot the picture, you cold-hearted bastard. How does a guy with no hair get fished like this? Easy. He's a gynecologist. The hell, he had a good time. He came, he went, it happens. You think he got it first in the heart or the groin? Depends upon how much the killer hated him. I tell you one thing though. Definitely a woman. How do you know it's a woman? Shot the groin. Ten to one, it's a woman. You better watch this moonlighting thing, Hector. You're starting to lose your edge. And I gotta make some cash, all right? I got four mouths to feed at home. I know this card. Bedroom Eyes? Yeah, I know it from another case. -Similar M.O. -Got shot in the groin too? Uh-uh. This guy got a smile on his face. Shot right through the back, through the heart. Just like an arrow. Guy never knew what hit him. There was a fan, kicking around the smell of death all over the place. Case really gave me the creeps. I wanted the shooter bad. What happened? Lieutenant put Hampton on the case, might as well have buried it. My case now. I'll tell you right now, if it is the same shooter, she's getting angrier. Cheer up, Hector. You're gonna love homicide. -May I come in, please? -Sure, come in. You came back early, you read my mind. -No, I changed my plans. -Thank God. I'm sorry but two days of your cat is all I could possibly tolerate. and had you been gone a month, I might have done something desperate or perhaps regrettable. I thought you liked cats. He is not a cat, he is a terrorist with claws, further disguised by four legs and a tail. Are you on drugs, Sue? Freud has fleas, William. He eats artificial plants, he attacks anything that moves, which means I can't walk in my own apartment. So I go to lie down and discover he's made my bed his litter box. Oh, I don't know what to say. I'm-- I'm sorry. Look, I'll pay for any damage. Would you like to come for linguine and clams later? Well, thank you. I'm-- You know, -I'm kinda... tired. -Tired. Yeah, but I think-- Look, I think he's just... venting at me, you know, his hostility because... I left him. My layman's opinion... he still misses Kate. Bye, William. Bye. Time is not a healer. Time is a thief. Day by day, minute by minute, time just... sucked the life from me until it was gone. But I was still there. I can't live a life without... life. If I had the willpower, I'd kill myself. But I'm just a coward who doesn't deserve to live anymore. Do you feel you don't deserve to live anymore? I am a moral leper, a serpent in the Garden of Eden. Do you feel like, like you're a serpent? I am a serpent. I don't feel anything. So, why don't you just... squish me? Then end it all... before I bring catastrophe on everyone. All right, it's a little over dramatic perhaps, uh, but that's an example of what mood disorder? - Depression. - Major depression. Maybe with some histrionic features thrown in. Now, the factors that predispose someone to depression are... Ms. Spear. The two primary factors are genetics and age, risk increasing dramatically with midlife and with major losses, of course. It is important to know the distinction between major depression and grief. Grief resulting from? Death... of a loved one. Okay. Next week, mania. Get out of here. It's a definite repeater. We got a match from the slugs. They're all .38 caliber, hollow points. Yeah, I know. I know, but, look, do you have one single eyewitness? How am I supposed to solve this case if you're gonna tie my hands? Look, do you have anyone that saw anything that remotely resemble a hooker going in and out of the penthouse? No, and you know we don't. Then why are you telling me it's a hooker? Look, I'm telling you, we've been down that road before, and it's a dead end. Let me tell you about dead ends. You put an imbecile on the case that wouldn't know a streetwalker from a jaywalker. That's your dead end. -Look, Vice never heard-- -The hell with Vice! What the hell do they know suddenly? Maybe she was new in town. Well, maybe she'd be old in town now. Call and see if they heard anything. I know that they haven't heard anything. But I know she's here. And I know that she's gonna kill again. And I'm gonna find her. Then, I'm gonna quit smoking. Maybe go to Miami, get myself a sun tan. And I'll start eating gummy bears, drinking Mai Tais. Ali Broussard. I-- I didn't think you'd be there this early. I'm an early riser. Who is this? It's William. William Tauber from the train. I'm sorry, I take so many trains. Could you be a bit more specific? We made love. Oh. Hi. How are you? I'm supposed to meet a woman named Ali here. Oh, outside? Yeah, thanks. Are you trying to tempt me again? Could you be? No, I have acrophobia. Why on a train then? Over a bridge, no less? That's counterphobic behavior. Maybe that's why I'm standing here right now. I mean, who wants to die a coward? Did you make a reservation? For two. Cancel it. Designer, huh? Yes. You do what? Homes or offices? -I do interiors. -Oh. Oh, my. And on your first date, do you always bring a man to work? -If I like him. -Yeah. And if he doesn't ask too many questions. -On the second date... -Yeah. ...I'll bring him home to his house. Yeah? Yeah. How about on the third? -Well, maybe after... -Yeah. -...I'd bring him home... -Uh-hmm. ...to his house again. And on the fourth, don't you ever bring him to your home? We are home. But he rarely makes it to the fourth date. So, what are you gonna teach me, Professor? What is it you wanna learn? Do you still wanna die? Hey, Susan, do you know anybody by the name of Bedroom Eyes or what? Have you seen Bedrooms Eyes? No, no, I haven't. You know you're a cutie, don't you? -How's it going, Wendy? -Hey. Come over here and talk to us for a while. All right. Okay. So, you know her? -No. -Do you know anyone who might know her? Come on. Don't be that way. Um, maybe, uh, maybe Francesca might know. -Francesca? -Yeah. You know you're a really pretty lady. Stay off the streets. - Hello? - Maria, how are you darling? - I'm fine. - Good. Listen, I apologize for calling you at home, but I was afraid if I phoned your service, we might not connect. Who is this? Always discreet. Harold Graham. I'm at the Duclaire 426. Suites were all taken this time but, um, the view is adequate, and I'll be here. Just me. See you in 45? I think you have the wrong number. Bedroom Eyes? Hello? That's what I adore about you. Those games you play. They keep me young. And those eyes. Those bedroom eyes. Well, you know what they do to me. She's got this aura about her. Okay, so she's got an intimacy problem. Maybe, who doesn't? You know, I mean, it's probably just a little intimacy problem. And in bed, she's a dream. She's better than a dream, better than any dream I ever had. I am not going to fall in love with her. Ooh, homicide. I am impressed. I just love a good murder mystery. Good, I love being entertaining. Oh, you are. I'm sure. You don't mind if I smoke do you? Oh, please, make yourself at home. So, maybe you could help us solve a little mystery? I would do anything for my country, Detective. Just consider me your civil servant. Good. So, where can we find Bedroom Eyes? -Is she your killer? -Why? Do you know her? No, no, but I've heard of her. And I'd love to have her. I tell you what, Detective, you find her and I will give you and your partner a night with a harem on the house. That's very generous of you, ma'am. Yes, I know. So, why don't you tell me which one of your clientele told you about Bedroom Eyes? Now, that is a problem. Because I just don't remember who. Well, we'd like to see your list. Ooh, que lindo. Did he just cross the border? A babe in the woods. You know that we could subpoena your list? You subpoena my list and there won't be anyone left to run this city. And it's already such a nightmare. Your choice, Detective. Besides, you won't find a judge who'll take the risk. Well, that might be true. And I guess we look like a couple of honest jerks to you. But I know one thing, lady. What goes around, comes around. See you around. Come on, babe. See you around, babe. - Oh, hi, Sue. - Hi. -Where are you going? -I was just out for a walk. I thought I'd stop by and say hello. -Hi. -Are those for me? Yes, as a matter of fact, they are. -No, they're not. -No, they are. Look, look at the card. "You're a lifesaver. With gratitude, William." P.S. My body is yours tonight? - What? - Got you. Oh. -How's Freud? -Freud's great. And, you know, he misses you. William. I'm sorry. I am so sorry. Well, I canceled the reservation. -I got tied up with a client. -Yeah, you could've called me. There was no way. I would have-- You could have called me at the restaurant. Look, honestly, I just lost track of time. I'm-- I'm really sorry. But, uh... Come on, the night's still young. There's plenty we can do. You wanna go to the movies? I haven't seen a movie in ages. I wanted to have dinner with you, you know, with a couple of candles. Oh, forget about the candles. I just-- I wanted to get to know you. Well, you can get to know me at the movies. You can learn a lot about a person at the movies. Are they the talking type? Are they the popcorn type? Does she put her head on his shoulder? Or her hand on his thigh? You'd go for the thigh, no popcorn, no talk. I might surprise you. -I'm not as... -As what? As predictable as you might expect. You? Predictable? You know the only predictable thing about you is your unpredictability. And I suppose you don't care to know anything about me either, do you? Not really. What the hell am I doing here? What am I doing here? William. What are you going to tell me? That you had a wife, 2.2 children and an Irish Setter? Well, that's what you want, that's what you have already and you don't really want it. That's just the past. I don't mean to sound cold, but it's old news. What is it with you, Ali? What is it about the past that scares you so much? Look, I like being with you. And if you feel in order to be with me now today, you have to tell me about yesterday, well, then tell me. Tell me what you have to tell me. Let's forget it. William? Tell me. My wife and I, we're on our way to DC. And our train crashed. That's where I got the scar. And she died. And I loved her. And I'm lonely. But it has been three years. And I don't miss her. Now... Now, what kind of movies do you like? French films always turn me on. I noticed. Do all men turn you on? Should I stop? No. I don't know. What are you doing? I used to do this a lot when I was a kid. You can come in, if you want. - You see? - Yeah. It's like our own miniature world. All safe and cozy. What are we safe from? -You overanalyze everything. -I know. So, what was your childhood like? Nothing much. Boring. Certainly nothing worth talking about. Give me a break. What are you 426, a finger painter? A damn graffiti artist. No! Sorry, Mrs. Graham Go ahead, Ernie. Harold Graham. Male Caucasian, age 56. Multiple gunshot wounds. Three, to be precise. All .38 caliber hollow points. Sound familiar? All fired to the groin. Well, at least we know that our killer can count. She's numbering her victims with bullets. Terrific. Ruling out the entire female population under the age of one and a half. Why don't you quit busting my onions, John, and help me with the subpoena? Told you to forget it. Besides, there's no one on that list that's gonna admit to being a client. I got an abscess on the tooth. You got any more pearls of wisdom, you can follow me to the dentist. No, thanks, John. I think I'll leave you to enjoy your own pain. I hate the dentist. I hope he needs a root canal. Okay, so you said you're gonna take me -to some place special? -I am. All right, what is the special occasion? -My birthday. -No. No, it's not your birthday, is it? Why didn't you tell me? Because I hate birthdays. They're ridiculous. Get in the car. It's a really nice place, man. Yeah. Lifestyles of the rich and famous. So, how long you've been in homicide? Eleven years. What, are you writing a book? And actually, I've been the curator -for the last five years -It's great. So, you said that you and your husband didn't have an argument that night? No. Gloria, move out to the... Do you have any idea why he might have checked into a hotel 10 miles away from your home? Yes. He often did that when he had an important meeting scheduled, morning meeting. My husband hated rush hour traffic. That's very interesting. But this was the first time that he ever stayed in this particular hotel, isn't that right? He liked variety. I hate to ask you this, Mrs. Graham, and I find it very embarrassing. -But I need to ask you-- -Well, let me save you the embarrassment then. If you're insinuating that my husband was having an affair, the answer is no. It's a beautiful layout, isn't it? I love art. My husband had no need to have an affair, he had me. When he wanted something more, -he had a prostitute. -A prostitute? On occasion. But please, it's not for public consumption. Well, Mrs. Graham, maybe we could go somewhere more private and talk, like your office. This has nothing to do with his death. There's no need to go anywhere else. It's over with her. By her, you mean there was only one? Yes, just one. Bedroom Eyes? But we haven't seen-- I mean, he stopped-- We? We haven't seen? Two women in the same room. He has his wife just sit there and watch. What kind of bastard would do that to his wife? Yeah. Look, I know that this is tough on you, Mrs. Graham, and we could forget about the whole thing if you'd only try to remember where your husband found her. I told you, he made all the arrangements. I didn't ask questions. I just showed up to please him. Please him? Tell me what would happen if you had no one to please him? I'm not a feminist, Detective, just a wife with old-fashioned values. What about the call girl? Did your husband always pay her by cash? Our sex life was private. He didn't want it on record. I want you to take a good look at this picture, Mrs. Graham. I want you to tell me what's wrong with it. This is murder. We don't wanna charge the wrong person. It's fine. Fine. If it's not right, Mrs. Graham, we can just take it from the top all over again. Let's do it, Maddox. How about the eyes, Mrs. Graham? Are the eyes fine? Are they perfect? These are so great. You look like a kid in these. No, I don't. Whoa. You're gonna take me home, partner. Roger that, ma'am. I have to change. We're going dancing. You like this place? -You come here often? -No. It's my first time. -What? -I said it's my first time, but I've heard about it. -I can't hear you. -Never mind. Hey, how you doing? -Fine. -Long time, no see. We'll have something different. -Long Island iced tea. -Thought you said -you wanted something different. -Isn't it? It's what you always order. Oh, you must have me confused - with someone else. - Right. Two Long Island iced teas coming right up. ♪ I've got a lot of talk For you baby ♪ ♪ And I declare I won't lie ♪ Well, the guy knew you from somewhere. Maybe he did. Maybe he saw me somewhere.

Detective, I don't think you understand. He was everything I had. Let me ask you something, Hector. What would your wife do if you forced her to watch you getting it on with a whore over and over again? She'd kill me, man, and then she'd kill the girl. Good evening, sir. What if she was really smart? You think maybe she would try to frame the whore? Oh, man. -You don't think that she-- -I mean, I don't know what I think. All I know is there's something fishy about this broad, okay? I think she's lying. I mean, what if... What if Bedroom Eyes is the one turning the tricks, okay? - And Mrs. Graham is the shooter? - On all of them? Well, I wouldn't be looking if her husband - was the only victim - Whoa, whoa, whoa, man. I don't know, man. She-- She doesn't look the type. Well, that's exactly what she'd want you to think if she was guilty. Let's get to work. Grab a cup of coffee? Yeah, sure. Let's grab a lobster dinner and after that we can catch the sunset. Did you touch your wife the way you touch me? How do I touch you? Is this the way it felt with her? There was a time... I can remember that... I can't remember the last time we made love. When it was or even how it was. Maybe that's because you didn't know it was gonna be the last time. That's what kills you, isn't it? Why is he staring at me like that? I don't know. I think he knows something about you that I don't. Ali? Ali. Ali. What's the matter? You know that I have 400 freshmen eagerly waiting for me to shed some light on their fledgling experience? How can I do that if I can't figure out... the woman I love. That's what's been bothering me. What? That I've fallen in love with you? No. When I fall in love, when I... ...feel that happening. That's when I end things. That's-- That's when I leave. I-- I always do. So the, um... The good news is that I'm falling in love with you but... the bad news is I... God. I know, it's okay. Never got depressed before when somebody told me they love me. I don't wanna leave you. Then don't. I just don't wanna hurt you. Oh. What, so you want me to leave first, is that it? You're the first person that I've ever told this to. And with the others, I-- I just leave. Oh, I'm so glad you told me. That makes me feel so much better because you love me. I should hit the road, huh? That's not what I said. That's what you meant though, isn't it, Ali? Because if I leave you, then you don't have to feel guilty. And aren't those the feelings that you're just-- Don't lecture me about feelings, William. Because that's about as deep as you go with them. What is that supposed to mean? It means that you teach them, you don't feel them. Then how can you hurt me? I probably can't. Because your emotions are buried under so much concrete, you can't even grieve over the death of your own wife. And until you do... honestly, I don't know how you could love anyone. Besides, you don't even know me. I mean, really know me. Guess you have some freshmen waiting. Hi, I was just... New lady in your life, William? Yeah, that's a good question. She looked like one to me. See you later, Sue. Okay. Hi. Let me get a picture of him before you bag him. No problem. I'm gonna get you if it kills me. Thanks a lot. You bet. I'm glad you got my message. Uh-huh. Well, the reason I called was because I need to feel close to someone and I thought since you and I shared him... I knew you'd understand. In an hour? Fine. I'll be there waiting for you. Yes, he was, wasn't he? Yes, he was. Stoller, Homicide. Hi, Andre. - Who found her? - The maid. They heard a shot. She was dead by the time they got here. It's a suicide, sir. Get these guys out of here. Do you mind stepping outside, please? You better take a look at this. Rookie opened it. Found it on the table outside. "Dear, Detective Stoller. Tonight, I was going to take her life... and then my own. At first, I didn't tell her that I knew she'd killed him. But then something snapped. 'Kill? My God', she said. 'I didn't kill your husband.' She started to cry. At that moment, she seemed like a child to me and I wondered if her eyes were the last my husband saw. So, I let her leave." "I'll never know... but maybe you can find the truth, Detective. I believe in you. Mrs. Harold Graham." Thank you. I'm getting really tired of waiting, man. Why don't we just go grab her, take her in? Because, Hector, my darling, all we got right now is circumstantial evidence. I'm not going anywhere. Yeah. Got to be a boyfriend. I think I know why you leave now. Why? Because you're afraid they're gonna leave you. - Hmm. - I won't. It's a boyfriend, for sure. Keep an eye on her. I'm gonna go check the guy out. -What's going on? -I'm Detective Stoller. We got a little problem in the neighborhood. Can I talk to you for a few minutes? - Yeah, sure. - Pull over there, please Can I see your license, please? Yeah, yeah, sure. What do you do for a living, Mr. Tauber? I'm a professor. -Professor of what? -Psychology. That must be really interesting. With which university? Uh, what is this regarding? Bedroom Eyes. -Come again? -How long have you known her? -Known who? -Bedroom Eyes. What is that, some kind of a person? Yeah, it's the person you were just kissing. Ali? Yeah, how'd you get hooked up? Was it business or strictly pleasure? -Now, hold-- Look, hold on here. -Hold on for what? Look, you're gonna have to slow down here a minute because I'm just getting a little bit lost. You want me to rephrase it? Was she your call girl or did you meet her off duty? Is this some kind of a joke? No, sir. There ain't nothing funny about homicide. That's right, pal. Murder. Did you know she was involved in murder? I can verify what I'm telling you, pal, believe me. Anything at all and we'd be justifying why she's gone. Uh-uh, no payback. She kills her victims after sex. May I ask you something? Is she using any excuses to you? Multiple murders we'’re talking about. Victims, sex, that's from your girlfriend, Bedroom Eyes. You could be next. Who is this? Uh, yeah, I'd like to make an appointment. With Bedroom Eyes. Hey, how long you been asleep? Just a minute, man. What time is it? Oh, man, her lights are off. You better believe she ain't asleep. What are you doing? None of your business. Go back to sleep. Hi This is your answering service. You have an appointment tonight with Mr. John Dolan at 10:00 at the Hilton Hotel. Thanks, bye. May I turn your sheets back? Uh, no. No, thanks. Ooh. John Dolan? Oh, honey. This is gonna be a pleasure. Are you kidding me? So, you wanna let me in or, uh, are you into doorways? Or, uh... ...maybe you'd just like to look. It's okay, honey, because I am into everything. Come on in. Why, thank you. John. Wow, this place is great. Oh, yeah, we can definitely have some fun here. -This is gonna be... -And what is all this, huh? What is going on? Where are you from, John? How about giving us something to drink? And I'll tell you what's going on. Anything you want, baby. Anything you want. That's what I'm here for. And we're gonna have a really good time and there's... a lot of different ways that we could have it. You know, we can, uh... We can play it straight if you like or, uh... maybe a little half and half, if that's what you're into. Or I don't know-- I don't know, maybe there's some, uh, particular fantasy that you'd like to work out. And... for no extra charge. If you want me to run the show. I can do all the talking. You know, somebody told me all about you, and that's why I'm here because I didn't believe this. I just want the truth. Well, okay, Johnny. There is... something to be said for, uh, getting business out of the way first. I like a man who's direct. The truth is, Johnny... -that at $350 an hour, a-- -What are you doing to me, Ali? What the hell are you doing to me, huh? What? What? Oh, oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I get it. I get it. You know Ali? Yeah. Oh. You know Ali... Oh, I bet I know who you are. Who? You're William. Yeah. Yeah. I'm William. Well, William, this is great, I've been wanting to meet you. You have? You've been wanting to meet me? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And you know what? What? I'm not even gonna charge you, William. Because any friend of Ali's is a friend of mine. Baby. William. William. I know what you need. Honey... I can give you what you need. She can't. You know she can't. William. I can give you the last time. The last time with your wife. So pretty. What was her name again? Kate. Yeah, Kate. Kate? I can be your Kate. Come on. Come on. Come on, baby. That's good, baby. Come on. Come on, baby. That's right. I'll be your Kate. Yeah. That's right. You like? Come on. What are you waiting for? Just close your eyes, baby. Close your eyes. I'm gonna take you with me. You're gonna come with me back to a place that's safe... and warm and free. So, you can just let go, baby. Let go. Police, get your hands up. -I said put your hands up. -Don't move. - Hey. Come on. - Check out the bedroom. - Right. - What the hell is going on? Get against the wall. Put your hands and your face against the wall, spread your legs. -Oh, come on. -I said spread 'em! She's not between my legs, Detective. Shut your mouth and don't move. She's not here, I found this in the bedroom. Check out the hallway, see if anybody's seen her. Come on. You know you're chasing your tail, Stoller. Sit down. She was never even here. I don't know what your problem is, Professor. I don't think you got an idea what's going on. - Will you listen to me? - No, you listen to me. You keep away from your girlfriend, or you're gonna end up in the morgue like the rest of her boyfriends. Will you forget about that? You got her wrong. The hell I do. She's been dropping bodies all over town, pal. It's not her. She's not the same person. I'm warning you, Professor. Stay away from the woman. - Hello? - William? Ali, I'm glad you called. Are you okay? Yes, can you meet me? I'm at the carousel. Yes, yes, I can-- I can meet you there in 15 minutes. Hang on. William, is something wrong? Listen to me. Whatever you do, don't go to your house. Do you understand me? Yes, I need to see you. - Fifteen minutes. - Okay. Good, bye. Ali? Ali? Are you all right? What are you doing here? You know what happened tonight? No. I was in a hotel room tonight. You knew? I smelled her perfume on you. It's another woman, isn't it? Yes and no. I think there are two women, Ali. Each beautiful and special, very special. What are you talking about, William? Is there another woman or isn't there? I don't know. Do you trust me? Yeah. Are there spans of time, time you lose? Big blackouts where there are no memories. I don't know what you're talking about. What about people, Ali? Were you ever approached by people who insist they know you but you're sure you've never met them? Have they ever called you by another name? Don't analyze me, William. -Were you... -Don't. ...ever accused of lying, Ali? What about the past, Ali, is it really a blank page? Were you ever abused, Ali? Oh, hi, John Dolan? Did you have fun with your wife tonight? Bedroom Eyes. It's a beautiful name. Hmm. My dad thought so too. - Dad? - Uh-hmm. That's what he used to call me. Under the sheets. Oh... your father. Your wife. You never did answer my question. You, you were good. Better than Ali? More experienced, I suppose. Huh. Dad did pay me to learn. Don't you feel sorry for me, Doc. How do you feel? Like doing it. I don't think that is how you feel. Oh. Why don't you tell me? I think what I feel scares you. What, that you're afraid? You're feeling pain? No, that I'm not. I mean, I could be dangerous, couldn't I, Doc? Yeah, I'm not a doctor. Oh. My mistake. Smoke? No, thanks. It'll kill you. Oh. -Did you ever... -What? ...hurt anyone? -No. -I mean physically? No, my God. I wouldn't-- I would never... I would never hurt anyone. -Would Ali? -William, she saved your life. I mean, don't you trust us? Are there only the two of you to trust? Look, let me explain something to you. I know all about Ali. She doesn't even know I exist. I mean, she knows something's wrong, but take now for instance. Where the hell is she? Oh, we could... We could ask her to come back. Uh-uh. Too intense for her. Like when Dad cut her with the fan. Guess who had to bleed? Is that how she got the scar on her side? Oh, it's my scar. She didn't stick around for it to heal. That's when I showed up. Tell me what you're scared of. -Me? -Yeah. There's bad things. People think I'm doing them. I'm tired. I'm at the train station. Look, Sue, I just need you to look after Freud for a little while. I'll make it up to you. Don't worry about it. You're the best. Take care, all right? Sue, thanks. Bye. I gotta get you out of here. He's at the train station. Thanks. Look, lady, you're not turning in a man, you're saving his life. Lock your door, don't let anybody in. Now we know you didn't do it. If you always leave the same way... and the men don't know that you're gone. Maybe somebody's coming in behind and killing them. Boy. I must have been tired, I, uh... How long have I been asleep? Ali. I had the weirdest dream. It was like I was awake in the dream. I mean, it's not make-- It doesn't make a lot of sense -because I-- -Because it wasn'’t a dream. No. No, it was-- It was just-- It was bits and fragments. I mean, have you ever had one of those just... That's your memory, Ali. -Imagery, those-- -Your memory coming back, Ali. That's your memory. No. No. No, I did-- I remember there was-- There was somebody else, a man, a voice. -There's a woman. -That's great. -It's a strange woman. -That's great. A very strange woman. That's great. You're starting to hear her. No. No, I distinctly remember another person, another voice. No. Ali. Ali. Ali, come on. I'm sorry. Listen to me. Listen to me, I want to see you. Ali. Come on. -Get away from me. -No. Listen to me. I'm sorry. -Get away from me. -No. No, no, no. Listen to me, please. Listen to me. Look, you have a condition... but it can be cured. It's-- It's called disassociation. You heard of that, right? Sometimes, when terrible things happen, you know, the mind, it splits off-- Splits off from what? What are you saying to me, William? -Are you saying I'm crazy? -No. No, you're not. You are not. You're not crazy. Listen to me, you were hurt. You protected yourself the best way you could. Another person came in to help you deal with the pain. That's the way it happens, okay? -Okay. She's a friend. -No. It was too much for one child to handle alone. -No. -Listen to me. No! No. You're safe. You're safe now. Don't run anymore. You don't have to run anymore. Oh, my God. Ali, it's you. You lied to me. I believed you... and you lied to me. No. No. Ali never lied to you. I tried. I tried to make you leave me... because I love you and I don't... And I-- I couldn'’t leave. I couldn'’t leave. Who are you? Oh. Do you know what it's like? Do you know what it's like? To find yourself in bed with someone touching you, hurting you, and you don't even know who they are? You don't even know how you got there. Someone... is putting me there... and it's not me. It's not me. And she's got to be caught. She's got to be punished. Where is she, Ali? Where is Bedroom Eyes? Those men, those men who can fool and dominate, suffocate. They hurt you and they won't stop. You can go, Ali. If that's what you want, you can go. They have to be stopped. But you won't stop them. I'm gonna stand right here. And I'm gonna let you go. I'll watch you go. Oh. Oh. I love you. Oh, Ali. I love you.
