Batterzog... Zerylum ... Two words that should convey something but didn't. The mystery, I guess, of language. Two words that might have brought me closer to my brother clive, but did otherwise. There was a time when we were close, when it seemed anything was possible. That was before we were celebrating clive's genius, watching him win math competitions and before he started speaking his language that I didn't understand. Batterzog ... Zerylum ... I was shut out. I thought they were a lovely couple. Yes, they are. Don't tell me. How many goddamn times? ...the free swimming fish are the monarchs of the open waters. Their success is due to their mobility, their keen senses and their relative intelligence. - What? It's mind control. It's nothing more than mind control. - Yeah, but... - Your mother's right. It is, mind control. It is. It's a vast wasteland. 30 minutes to go, gentlemen. Keep your concentration. Come on, honey. Well, where to for the celebration, folks? - What if he didn't win? What? They haven't graded anything yet. - What if the sun didn't rise? - What if the Indians finished above .500? Well, where to, my geniuses? - Ne menj messze. - Pardon, honey? - Ne menj messze. Watch that language. - I know a diner that serves great pancakes, Mrs. Messerman. So Sandra, how've you been? - You were saying 12 coins, three weighings on a balance scale... - Right. - William, honey, are you going to eat your pancakes? - Yeah, I am. - And you find the counterfeit, but you don't know whether it's heavier or lighter. - Well, right. That's what makes it hard. It'd be trivial if you knew which one were heavier. Or lighter, of course. - Of course. - William, honey, there are people in this world who would give their right arm for those pancakes. - For these pancakes? William. - All right, little brother? - Hey... get outta here... what... No... Elliot! - And you figured this out just now in the gym? Right. - Well then, it oughta be easy enough. - I've been fine, actually, Mrs. Messerman. Thank you for asking. ...thank you for the ride home, Mr. and Mrs. Messerman. - You're welcome, Sandra. Anytime. - Clive, aren't you gonna walk Sandra to the door? - Yeah. - No, that's o.K., I'm fine. Thank you for the pancakes. - Shut up! - I'm not gonna pay! That's all I'm paying, bitch! Shut up! - You can go, she's fine. O.k. So, clive, I have to ask, have you ever tried transcendental meditation? - No... - Well, it's fantastic... Transcendental, that's like, uh, that's like, uh... Transmission. No, no , truly... Trans-axle meditation. - All right, first course! Oh! Vegetables! Oh, look at this! Such a feast! What food! - Wow, that's beautiful. Thank you. Oh. - Here's to having seats together... On r-r-rocket ship earth... And incidentally, everyone, here's to the new math champion of William Howard taft high school. - Whoo! - Yes! - And here's to our neighbors, the cubanos. Mmm! - And to our neighbors, the messermans. - Thank you for having us. - And to our next victory in the city finals. You know, the kids at school are all pretty impressed with clive. I overheard some of the juniors talking and well, they think he's a genius. - Yeah, but those are the vocational kids. - My two geniuses. - What did Einstein say? "Mathematics transforms the fortuitous concourse of atoms into the tracery of the finger of... God." Wow! That's beautiful. - Herbert turnbull atchley, not Einstein. - No, Einstein said don't worry if you're not good at math, because neither was he, and I, for one, will drink to that. - What he said was, "do not worry about your difficulties in mathematics. I can assure you that mine are still greater." - Oh, oh, norm byzantine... Lieutenantbyzantian served with me. Right now, he's living, poor fellow, in the napa valley... - Wow. - Here's what he has to say: "A wistful elegy of a zinfandel, a nearly human longing in a grape." No, um... Clive? To peace. To peace. ♪ Hey, it ain't easy girls, it ain't easy ♪ ♪ to get the man you love satisfied ♪ ♪ it ain't easy, girls, it ain't easy ♪ ♪ to keep the one you love by your side... ♪ - ...that's your card. - O.k. That is not my card. - Grind, grate, chop, purify, frappe... Grind, grate, chop, liquefy, purify, frappe, grind... - Are you sure you don't want any? I can barely eat half. - Oh no, thank you, Mrs. Messerman, i-I'm too nervous to eat. - Please, call me Judy. - It's only Cleveland. And he's got the counties. It's really just the beginning, then he's got regionals, then the states... It's really a long season. And sheshevyky'll be at the states. - Who's sheshevsky? - Ariel sheshevsky. His parents are both physics professors. They live in Columbus. Now, heis a genius. Well, I guess that makes two of them then. - Three of them, actually, Sandra. Of course, Mrs. Messerman, three of them. - Call me Judy. Well, I don't think we have much to worry about. - Of course not. Clive has a rare strength in him. So Billy de salz and me are waiting in the gym parking... - Billy de salz and I. Well, o.K., you weren't there, but I see your point. Billy de salz and Iare waiting in the gym parking lot during varsity basketball, and this girl, jeannine lyons, who's a total fox but is seeing Joe Blair and everybody knows it, is totally p.O.'D at Blair for something and you know... - William, would you pass the salad over this direction? - Sure. So jeannine comes out with Billy and I while Joe... With Billy and me. - All right, well, jeannine and Billy and I are hanging out at Billy's car. What kind of car? Wait, Billy de salz is driving already? - Yes, his dad's continental. - So anyway, jeannine comes out... - Carl de salz has a Lincoln continental? - Must this always be about insurance? - Well, I should be handling that account. - Well, anyway, it turns out that jeannine's not really out there to cry on Billy's shoulder. As a matter of fact, she's there to talk to me. You sure about that? - Yes, as a matter of fact, I am. - May I remind everybody here that someone in the messerman family still has to make a living. Was that a Mark III or a Mark iv? - I think it was a Mark iv. But anyway, so we're standing out there, you know, rapping and... - You're what? - Rapping, you know, talking. Did it have those little oval opera windows in the back? - Yeah, I think that it did, dad. But anyway, the fact of the matter is that jeannine plays the piano... In fact, she's working on the chopin nocturne, the same one that I'm working on. - I'd say it's definitely a Mark iv. - Honey, your son is talking. - Anyway, needless to say, jeannine is very impressed. - Chopin was different than the other romantics. He was a pole among parisians. But he stuck to his convictions. You know what schumann said when he heard his first chopin piece? - That's an 85... $8500 car. - You gonna eat all of those? - Hey! Hey! - He said, "hats off, gentlemen. A genius." - "Beauty is another form of genius... Higher indeed than genius as it needs no explanation." - Oscar wilde? Oscar wilde. - "It is of the great facts in the world like sunlight or springtime or in the reflection in dark water of that silver shell we call the moon." - And all the geniuses have remained mysteriously silent on the subject... Of the anchovy. - It's a Caesar. - Although anchovies, if I recall correctly, are $1.60 a tin... thank you, Ohio mutual! - We could have done perfectly well without the anchovies. Right on. - Insurance is about protecting the average person, it's about the problems of the common man. - Why lie to your family? - Excuse me? - You know, dad, you're either part of the problem or part of the solution. - Or dissolved in a solution. - Yeah, the point is... We didn't... the point is we did not do without the anchovies. - The point is, Simon, that your son has won the math championship of the city of Cleveland. - Oh Jesus, I forgot to ask about that. - And there are people in the world who would give their right arm for this anchovy. - Well, jeez, that is wonderful, clive. Here's to the champion of the great city of Cleveland. Damn cough. - Welcome to Cleveland. - Shhh, quiet. What were you doing? - Nothing, I just didn't really know what they were. - No... I mean, what were you doing over there? - Oh, it's my history project. - Your history project. - Yeah, it's the pieta, Michelangelo. It's Mary holding Jesus but he's dead, but... it's no big deal. - Don't tell me you're really a genius too. - Not really. Um, were you watching me? - A little. - I didn't do anything weird, did I? Nope. - Sometimes I do. - Here. Come here, little brother. I had to move here. It was my only choice. - You sleep here? - Yeah. I'll tell you another secret. I like you, little brother. You and me, we have this connection, you know? You know more than everybody thinks. - I do? - Yeah. - I could bring you food, Sandra! - That'd be cool, you know? I wish clive was as cool as you sometimes. I wish. - I'm really not that cool. Yeah, you are. Question. Does Elliot ever bug you? Oh, I dunno, I mean... not really, but... Oh, sometimes, I guess. - Well, he bugs me. - Yeah? - Clive is so superior to him. I mean, clive really is a genius and Elliot's the farthest thing from. - Yeah, I hear you. - Did he ever tell you about us? - Who? - Clive. Did he ever tell you about he and I? - No. - He didn't? - No. - You're not gonna tell your parents about me, are you, William? - No... no way. - You're not gonna tell anybody, not even clive? - Clive doesn't know? - Of course, he knows, genius. It's good practice, keeping your mouth shut. I get the feeling you could use some. All right, I'll tell ya. I'm clive's lover. - Oh... Bonjour. Thank you. Why, that's very kind of you. Michelangelo, his pieta? He's transformed the fortuitous concourse of atoms into the tracery of the finger of god. A pole among parisians. Oui, madame, I have come to see you again. - Lover? Whoa! Come on! - Get back there! - Oh! Get him! Get him! Oh, he scores. Good one, honey! Yeah, the old man's still got it. - What? - I dunno. - First finger. - Right. - Thumb on the "a" so that you can reach gently into the octave. This is romantic music. Chopin died at age 39. This is the gift of his suffering to the world. - So now I suffer? - The girls adored chopin. - They did? - Mm-hmm. Think of Jeannie lyons, think of how this would move her heart. - It's jeanninelyons, mom. - Jeannine then. Think of how this would move her. Let me ask you something. Does your brother ever speak that language of his at school? - Sometimes. - What do the other kids think of it? - I don't think they understand. - Is there some key to it, some kind of dictionary? - Well, if there was, he wouldn't tell me about it. - Can you multiply 275 by 5,386? Can you do that in your head? Can the other kids do that in their heads? - Mom... I made that stuff up about jeannine lyons. - I know that, sweetheart. - You know? - Honey, a mother knows her children from the day that they're born. I know you won't understand that for a while but I've known how you were gonna turn out since you were two years old. - Well? - A brilliant pianist. - And clive? - Comedian. - No, really. Do you know about clive? - What about him? - I dunno, just... you know, um, what's going on with everything? - Is there something going on with him? Oh sweetheart, you're just as extraordinary as your brother. - Mom, please. - You don't have to be the same, you're different. He does things that you're not going to do. - What kinds of things? - Just things that have to do with who he is. Your brother is gifted. But with that gift comes its own weight. Do you understand that? William, your brother will need you for his whole life. That's what it's like to be a brother to a boy like that. And for the rest of your lives, you will have more in common with each other than you have with anyone else in this world. - Except that he happens to be a genius. Maybe, but you talk to the girls in English. Remember that. - Hey... What's happening? You know, what gives? Yeah, I hear you. - Hold it in. - I hear you. - There are people in the world who'd give their right arm for that dope. So, you know this language you guys talk? Did you make it up or... - Nem. - What does that mean? - Sheyteni. - Do you have, like, a dictionary or something for it? - Hogyne. - You know, if you ever want someone to talk to, you know, just get something off your chest, you can talk to me. You know, I know more than everybody thinks, you know. I'm your brother. - Good to meet you. You know I beat you last time. You make things up. - Service. - What is that? - What do you think of clive, dad? - What do you mean, what do I think of clive? - He's been acting a little weird lately, don't you think? - Is that supposed to be a newsflash? - Just thought I'd ask. - So now, what do you think of Elliot? - Elliot is a fine kid, why? - Nothing, I'm just talking, that's all. What about Sandra? - What about her? - Well, what do you think about her? - She's his belle, if that's what you mean, but he will get over her. Come on. - I'm not sure he will. I think she's actually kind of pretty. Pretty... William... Maybe she is, but it's the cheap kind of pretty. It's not the kind of pretty that lasts... I guarantee it, sailor. Now, service. Sorry! Service. - What are you sorry about? - This was the gift of his suffering to the world. ...hey, Sandra. It's me, William. Sandra? - Hey. I was expecting you. You brought me oranges. - Yeah, William of oranges. Er, they're tangerines, actually. - William of tangerines. So, William of tangerines... - Look, I'm really sorry about what my dad said. I just thought it would come out funny. - Well, it didn't. - Yeah. - That's o.K. 'Cause clive and I have the kind of love that your father will never understand, that's all. So tell me, William... - There's a whole bag of tangerines upstairs. I don't think anyone's gonna miss 'em. - That's not what I was thinking of. - Yeah, I didn't think so. - I know what you want to tell me. I'm just waiting for you. I'm clairvoyant, you know. - Clive's gonna win the counties. - No, not what I was thinking of either. - What do you want me to say? - Is it true that you think I'm beautiful? - ♪ ...come out, come out ♪ - ♪ oh, you better believe me ♪ - ♪ come out, come out... ♪ What do you think about this music, sailor? - It's all right. - Your brother's quite enamored of it. - Dad, my... my report card came. - Yeah, I know. I got a call from Mr.. Farmer's office. - It was just one bad semester... - Don't sweat it, sailor. At ease. All this business with clive... You know, just things he does... The music and his language... I want you to know that he's just trying to understand his life, that's all. You understand what I'm saying? - Yeah. - I, I'm not saying what he does is wrong and if you want to try some of those things some day... that's fine. - It is? - Yeah. My generation has a lot to learn from your generation. Yup. A grown man with a purple tie. Look at me... Your father. - Look at me, dad, your son. - "What a noble creature is man." Your old man sells insurance... Will you ever forgive him? - Yeah, I forgive you, dad. I just want you to know that grades don't mean anything. I want you to know that. Why, I'm proud you don't care about them. - You are? - Yeah, they're an external symbol of approval for something you ought to be doing for its own sake, anyway. Affirmative, sailor? - Affirmative, captain. - In 100 years, no one will know about the puny trials of our days. "Sweet mercy, how my very heart has bled to see thee. Poor old man... With thy gray hairs grow white in the snowy blasts." - It's not that bad, dad. - Samuel Taylor coleridge, William. That's what important, not your report card. - So, that's how we'll settle it. Chet will leave clive alone and won't come anywhere near him at school. Agreed? - Yeah. - Chet. - Yes, Mrs. Messerman. - And, clive, you won't do anything to provoke Chet here, agreed? Clive? ...what is it about this new america that hates intelligence? What is it about this country? When I was a girl, we called our teachers "professor." We revered them. We all wanted to be like them. I mean, there was no greater achievement for us than learning. Now, in america, we spit on that. We attack it, the great pillars of our culture: Learning, art, beauty. They... they might as well be vices! You know what mao is doing in China? Breaking up all the violins into pieces, smashing them all up. Maybe that's what's next here. Maybe that's what this is leading to. So... What's happening? - We're Buddhist monks. It's clive's idea. Ohm... Clive, William, dinner! - Just a minute! Clive, William, dinner! It's not polite to keep our guests waiting! - The potatoes kind of taste funny. - You know, what does it mean exactly, Mrs. Messerman, "twice baked"? - That's a good question. Mom? Well, I spoon the potato back into the skin and bake it again. - What a great idea. - Seems awful cruel and unusual for the potato, does it not? Thank you, Sandra. And you're welcome to come by anytime, by the way. - Thank you. So lucky to have such a good cook for a mother. - It's not that big a deal. - It's not? - W... no. I mean, the potato's not that big a deal. You're a great mother. It's really great having a good cook as a mother. - Is your mother a good cook, Sandra? - She doesn't do much cooking, actually, Mr. Messerman. Thanks. - Thanks for what? - Oh, thanks for asking, dad. - Oh. You're welcome, I guess. - It's just not really her thing. - Oh, I can understand it. - So can I. I think we all can understand. - I think so too. - The square root of 56,389. Clive? - 237 point... about four-six. - Oh, that truly is extraordinary. Where do you get that from? - From the back of the sock drawer. What about primes between 900 and 950? - You know, sheshevsky is going to be at the states. You think sheshevsky's at home reading magazines? - Why do you call him "sheshevsky"? You call me "messerman"? He's just a guy. His name is Ariel. And the prime? - 907, 911, 919, 929, 937, 941, 947. - Got it. - Look out, sheshevsky. - You think something funny's going on? - Funny? - You know... - Oh... That? Dad'll never do anything. He won't? - He's trapped in a cage. - Yeah, dad's in a cage. - That's right. - What kind of cage? - A cage of his own devising. Cool. I don't think that's loud enough, clive. Do you think you can play any louder, clive? - I didn't know you understood electronics to that degree. - I'm trying to do some homework. You know, some of us have homework to do. You know, study, books... see? Hi, Sandra. - Hello, William. Gyanus. Hogyne. - What does that mean? I think it means "once more, with feeling." - Where'd you find that? - Where'd you leave it? - Give it here. - What is it? - It's nothing! - Then why you freaking out about it? - Fuck it! William, give it here! - No, stop it. Stop it, get off. - Hey, hey, hey, quit being a brat. - All right! All right. - Fuck you, William! - It's the dictionary. - What? - Good job, William. We figured you'd be looking for it. - I wasn't looking for it. - Yeah, right. - I wasn't looking for it. - It's not exactly a dictionary. It's more like a... Rosetta stone. - I used to have one of those. - You did? - Look, how 'bout giving it here. - No. - Let him keep it if he wants. It won't do anybody any good. - Fine, I'll just keep it then. - What do you mean, it won't do anybody any good? - He only found half of it. He only found the words. - You didn't think that we'd keep the meanings in the same place... Did you, little brother? William! - Um, I'm coming! - I got one. - Oh, come on. - Yeah. ...so handsome. Everybody ready? Here we go... Here we go, here we go, here we go. Catch... this. ♪ Oh! ♪ ♪ A-ha! ♪ Mmm... wow! It's not bad. Uh, it's, um... it's innovative. It's really, um... You crack me up, Mr.. Cubano. - No, it's not bad at all. It's, uh, it's not what I call danceable but it is original, right? I'll give you that. - Oh, no, no. No, no, no. I could dance to this. Play it again. I know you can, honey. Honey? - Come on. - Come on back, sweetheart. Let Simon have the stage, all right? Play another one for us. Play another one, all right? You sit and you behave. Yeah, o.K. Here we go. - Catch this. - ♪ Teachers, parents and politicians, they ridicule the wild... ♪ - Well? - O.k., I like the second one better. I like that one. - Oh, no, no, no... - It was good... no, it was! - The first is sexy. - Sexy...

We may as well learn about it. - Simon, you can listen to whatever you wish, but there are certain things I will never accept. What would chopin think? What would mendelssohn think? - Oh, come on. We're not gonna talk about chopin. - The world's changing, honey. We're all gonna have to change with it. - And what did you say, young man? - Nem saameet. Pardon? - Holvon o veytsey, kayrem. - Clive, your mother asked you a question. - Why don't you tell us how you solved that problem, the one with the, um, coins and the scale, clive? I still don't understand it at all. - He doesn't have to talk if he doesn't want to, dear. - Yes, he does. Clive... Clive, please. - Answer Mrs. Cubano's question. Vee-sont-laa-taash-roh. Man, I... Now... It's great what kids do these days. They reinvent everything. Clive's invented a new language. What a nice surprise. Dr. Livingston, I presume? I just came down here to bring Sandra some food, you guys. - Feeding the monster? - Bite me. Where? My ass. You wish. - Thank you, William. That was sweet. William of grapefruits. So... since when has he known about this place? - Hey, don't worry, man. I didn't tell anybody, o.K.? Uh, who's worried? Hazudozo. Gyonyoru. - Yeah, you know, um, dad says that his generation's got a lot to learn from ours. I mean, he told me. - And, um, what else did he tell you? - Well, he said that, you know, you're just trying to understand your life. I hear ya. It's true, you know. He's right. We have to lead them through this stuff. No, we don't. We don't have to lead anybody anywhere. We have to educate them. Hold it in. - We don't have to educate anybody. Hold it in. You been studying the rosetta stone? - A little. Hazudozo. - Have you found the meanings yet? - No, I haven't been looking. - Of course you have. By the way, little brother, you are dressed kind of nice. You going somewhere? This is why I wanted to bring a map. - I used to find our way in the east China sea among Japanese subs in mined archipelagos. - Yeah, with a map. - The test started 15 minutes ago. - Well, that leaves us an hour and 45 minutes. Ah-ha. - Look, he's welcome to do what he can in the time that's left. - The others have been at it for 45 minutes already. That's just officious, is what it is. - It's not fair to the others. - Look, it was my fault, not my son's. I forgot to bring a map. - Well, maybe next time, you'll bring one then. - There won't be a next time is what we're telling you. - Clive, what do you think? - Sounds fine. - O.k., quick. - Just let me get a drink of water. - Good luck. - You guys, I can smell that that all the way downstairs! - Hey, William. I've been looking at the rafters. Have you ever noticed them? They're made of all these... Intricate pieces. - Clive and Elliot have... Told me some of their words. Servoos. - Servoos. - Ablak... Bayosh... Birkahoosh... - Szer... - Szer...eto. - Did they tell you what they mean? - No, not yet. - Little brother, the old man here has just tried his first doob. - Yeah, I don't know what this marijuana's supposed to do, William. - You tried it, dad? - Yeah, I did, sailor. And watch out, sheshevsky. - Here. Take it. - Dad? That's interesting. Didn't anybody ever teach you how to smoke a cigarette? You didn't inhale. - Yes, I did. - He never has. - Do you know, your brother won the cuyahoga county finals this morning? - Dad, I was there, remember? - Oh... Yeah. - Congratulations, clive. - Thank you. - By the way... I dried the lunch dishes for you. Takes me days to plan a meal. It's really great, mom. - Thank you. - Now, I'm telling you, he's a criminal. He sent his henchmen into that hotel and all those clowns in his cabinet were complicit. He's gonna be impeached, you Mark my word. - Thank you for this lovely meal, Judy, it's so good. William? - Hmm? - Can you open up that window for me, please? - Uh, sure. - Simon, it's 40 degrees out. We could use some cool air in here, could we not? - Very nice, Simon. William, would you close the window now, please? - Sure. Now, let us try the red wine. "That is why I have come to California, for soil the color of a dark sea. Too many years on ships and you forget the taste of women... And wine. In the earth we shall find... Mmm, a hidden source." - Here's to the champion of cuyahoga county. - Here, here. - Here, here. - Cheers. And here's to the hidden sauce. - Source. - Yup. My wife is... right. And I only have one son left. - What is that supposed to mean, Simon? - Well, I don't know. I'm surprised myself. - You're drunk. - Indeed I am. But that's not all. - So, clive... Tell us what the math finals were like. - Math is just concentration, Mrs. Cubano. Math is... simple steps, one after the next. Each step is irrefutable... Unassailable... rising higher and higher into the sky, each stone no more than what it is. But with such simple stones, in time, you have built a cathedral. That is what math is. It's a cathedral, and when you have finished, you enter it in awe and you sit beneath the arch and you feel what human beings have always longed to feel. - That was lovely, clive. - It's me, captain. - Yeah, sailor. Is that bach? No, no, Mozart? Or could it be... haydn, is it? - It's albinoni. - Dad, what would you say if I had gotten myself into some trouble? - What kind of trouble? - Serious trouble. - You won't. - How do you know? - How do I know? I just do. Character is fate. Heraclitus said that about two thousand years ago. - What if I could change my character? You won't. That's my point. You can't resist being who you are. No one can. Expensive tastes, a raccoon that likes anchovies. - Thank you, Ohio mutual. - Dad, what were you like in high school? - What was I like? - Yeah, I mean, did you get good grades? Were you a good student? - Oh, we were at war then, William. Pass me my drink. You know, in geometry, they taught us bomb trajectories. Uh, yes, I cared about my grades and then I went to war. - Well, you know, grades are just an external symbol of something that you ought to be doing for yourself in the first place. - You're a quick study, aren't you, William? Well... You should know something then... That what I said about your grades was dead wrong. Your grades are about as important as anything gets. Grades are all an employer will have to judge you by. You know that's right, right, William? I mean, you know, don't you, that these... These crazy times are gonna pass. ...why don't you two find something to do for a while? This could take some time. - Oh, there you are. - Math was never my subject. - Grades aren't important. - Cool. - They're just an external symbol of something that you ought to be doing for yourself in the first place. What do you think of that? - I think you're funny. Think of clive in there, doing this stuff. - One of these equations is wrong. - What? - It is, the calculations are incorrect. - Come on. - They are. - Now, don't tell me you understand this stuff too? - Well... It's really not that difficult if you understand the equations. My two geniuses. Liar. Genius. Where'd you go? Look, I... I mean, I just found one small mistake in the equation. It's nothing. It's probably just, like, a typo. Try and find me. Do you really think I'm beautiful? - Yes. - How beautiful? - Very. Your beauty is like sunlight or springtime or... the reflection in dark water of that silver shell that we call the moon. - Wow. Did you just make that up? - It's not a big deal. - But you can't even see me. - Yes, I can. - No, you can't. - It doesn't matter. - You didn't really understand that math, William. - Yes, I did. O.k., you're right, I didn't. I pretended to. I just don't really like thinking about that kind of stuff. - What stuff? - Equations, the kind of stuff that clive thinks about. - Did you lie about anything else? - Oh, like that I think you're pretty? - Yeah. - No. I could never lie about that. How am I doing? - You're getting warmer. Nope... colder, genius. Good, warmer. What do you like to think about? - I like thinking about you. - ♪ Diamond girl ♪ ♪ you sure do shine ♪ ♪ glad I found you ♪ ♪ glad you're mine ♪ So how come you're not worried about it? How come you're not worried about walking to school in the morning? - Well, because I know I can do it. - Exactly. - Put, put more arc into it... Like that. - Math is just different for me. I know I can do anything in math, that's all. - Well, that's amazing. - Do that again. That's amazing to me. - Yeah, but there's, like, five kids on the block that can do that. You know, what you do is just so different. - But the thing is is that it's not. There's nothing amazing about it. It is just something that I can do. Like mom... you play an e flat instead of an e and she can hear that from across the street. But is that amazing? Is it amazing that a dog can smell you in your footprints? - Oh, maybe not, but every dog can do it. - Well, I guess you got me there. - Sheshevsky doesn't worry you? - Easy, tiger. - How long have you been there? - Not long. I was watching you. - Was I snoring? - You sleep like an angel. William... Have you told your parents about me? - No way. - Are you sure? - Positive. - I told you I was clairvoyant. - About what? - About this. I knew this would happen. Did you ever find the rest of their dictionary? - No. I'm still looking, though. I don't give up. - I've noticed. Tell me that thing you said again. - That thing? - That thing you said. - Oh, you mean, like, um... That you're the reflection in dark water of the silver shell that we call the moon? - Huh. Really... That was sweet. Oh... William, don't.

As the superintendent of the Cincinnati public schools, it is my pleasure to award this year's state medal in mathematics. Hmm, this is remarkable. I guess it's true what they say about great minds. Ladies and gentlemen, it's my privilege to bestow this year's championship medal on... Ariel sh... sheshevsky. And... clive messerman. Boys, could you, uh, please rise? - It's just a math competition. He didn't even win. ...mom, Sandra lives in the basement. - Boys will be boys. - She's been living there all year. She doesn't go home, mom. Her mom doesn't know where she is and she doesn't care. She lives behind the furnace. - Poor girl. - She lives behind our furnace. - Sweetheart... Do you think I don't know about Sandra? - You know about her? - Of course. I think it's kind of romantic. - Dad knows too? - No, he doesn't and I don't think you should tell him. Your father isn't always as... Forward-thinking as he seems. I want to ask you something. She's his girlfriend, right? - You mean, are they exclusive or something? - Yeah. That's what I mean. - I don't exactly know. - Well, it's fine if she lives in our basement. - Ping pong, captain? Dinner's ready! It's on the table! - Shh. - Oh... - Um... It's you. Serve. What? Boys? Dinner's ready. - Batorsag. - Szerelem. Oh, my god, Simon. Oh... - Unless we speak, how can we let someone know how we feel? A gesture, a look, perhaps, but are they enough? I never spoke about that day. I wanted to, but I never did. That's why, I guess, nothing changed, yet everything did. I obsessed about it for years, but never really had the guts to do it... to atone. And then, suddenly, it was too late. ...funny. Servoos,ladies. - Servoos. - Did he say "servoos"? Excuse me, ladies? Ladies. Excuse me, ladies? I'm sorry. Uh, did, did you say "servoos"? - Servoos. - Uh... where did you learn "servoos"? - Where do I learn it? In Budapest. Where do you learn it? - In kalocsa. - Are you Hungarian too, yes? - Hungarian? No, I'm not Hungarian... You were speaking Hungarian? Yes, indeed. Servoos is Hungarian. - Yes. Uh... Can I speak with you for just a minute? - Yes. - Is that o.K.? - Sure. - I'll be back, hon. - O.k. How 'bout here? - He was very smart. He didn't want anyone to understand him. It's, um... It's difficult to explain. I want to show you something. This was their dictionary. These were their words. - What? - This not a dictionary. - What is it? - Is a poem. - Can you, uh, can you translate it? - Yes... "Courage and love. The quiet I keep on the thin path to the Meadow is the hardest. The sound of your talk below..." "The quiet I keep on the thin path to the Meadow is the hardest. The sound of your talk below and wind in the trees is an oracle, our future now. I'm caught beneath the tilt of maples and cry of difference between ten thousand things... Leaf and stone, wind and grass, me, you. How could I live without you, my love, even for an afternoon? When the sun comes up, I open ten thousand eyes to you. When it sets, I open ten thousand more. I'm remembering and watching you at the same time. Do not miss me when I'm gone, my true and only friend. Do not even think of me. I could not bear to know."
