Subtitles by explosiveskull (KNOCKS ON DOOR) Hello. Anybody here? I need some assistance here. Hold on, I'm coming. Hold on. - Hi. - Hi! Oh, give it to me. Can I help you with somethin'? Yeah, give me one second, please. - Can you take this one for me? - Yeah, sure. Thank you so much. Hope I didn't leave you out there too long. Oh, no, not at all. Not at all. - Thank you very much. - Oh, you're welcome. Wow, look at all this stuff. Okay. I'm so tired. I can't believe you were actually able to get a flight so last minute, you know? Oh, me too. When I heard you were comin' in on such short notice I thought, there's no way. That had to cost an arm and a leg. Actually it wasn't that bad. Niko's family had a lot of the frequent flier miles saved up, so, they just gave 'em to us. That stupid Niko. Let me, I'll be right back. Hey, baby. Eileen's in here. Would you mind comin' in and helpin' her with the groceries real quick? Alright, baby, I'll be there in a second, okay? Let me just finish chopping these logs, alright? Okay, but hurry. We need a big, strong man in here. (LAUGHS) Will do, babe. Will do. Man, you're fucking whipped. He'll be in in just a second to give you a hand. (SIGHS) (BELLS CHIME) (COUGHS) (TENSE MUSIC) (CLATTERING NOISES) Hello? Hello? (DOG BARKS) (HIT THUDS) (COUGHS) (AX THUDS AGAINST FLESH) You gotta watch that step! That last one's a doozy. You better lay off the eggnog. Yeah, I would have to say so. Thank you for your help. I could've swore there were more decorations, though. Did you check the attic yet? That's what I was thinkin'. Well, let's go look. I'll help. No, no, no, no, no. You just focus on what you have to do, and I'll get Niko to help me with this. Where the hell is he, anyway? (TENSE MUSIC) Oh, there he is. Maybe he didn't hear us in the basement. You know, I'm gonna go catch him real quick and get him to help me with the decorations. Okay, I have to get dinner going anyway. Alright, well, we'll be right back down, so, if you need anything, let us know. Will do. (TENSE MUSIC) Niko, what's your problem? You left the door wide open. And while you're up there, can you grab the Christmas ornaments? Well, are you gonna answer me or not? Seriously, Niko, I don't know what your problem is. (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) Niko? Niko? (GLASS SHATTERS) (SCREAMS) (GAGS) No! No. No! No. No! (CHRISTMAS MUSIC) (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) (BELL CHIMES) (CHRISTMAS MUSIC) (CLATTERING) Monica? (THUMPING) Martha, are you okay? Monica, can you check on your grandma for me? (OMINOUS MUSIC) Martha? Martha? (KNOCKS ON DOOR) It's Eileen, are you okay? Sweetheart, what's going on with you? (TENSE MUSIC) (GROANS) Oh my God, sweetheart. Stay calm, stay calm. It's alright, I'm gonna go get you some help. Just stay right there, I'm gonna get you some help, okay? (SCREAMS) (CHRISTMAS MUSIC) (COUGHS) Dude, you got some real balls smokin' that shit while you're still on probation. Oh, whatever, man. It's like our last day. It's cause to celebrate. (BELLS CHIME) Hey, there's Victoria. Victoria. Right on time, as usual. Yeah, she's lame. She's not lame. She's normal. She's a sweet kid. Dude, she's a fucking asshole. (LAUGHS) Alright, alright, wrap it up. Let's go. I don't wanna be late. And the last thing that I want to do is two more weeks of this shit. One pm, ladies. Cutting it a little close, don't ya think? Look, can you cut us some slack, it's Christmas. Of course, merry Christmas girls. Now, it's freezing and my aunt is really busy, so, I'm gonna make this quick. You ladies have done a wonderful job. I have had no complaints, and that's huge. You still have a job to do. Only eight hours more and your community service will be done. So, let's get in there and give my aunt some help, okay? (OVERLAPPING CONVERSATION) Oh, would you look at that? They really pulled out all the stops this year. I bet you that dollar store made a killing on all that tacky garland. Stop it, Athena. This is a homeless shelter, not a drag show. We'll see about that. So, what am I doing? Cooking, cleaning, spoon feeding the old people? What's my job? PAULA: That's not up to me, you have to ask Noelle. Who's Noelle? NOELLE: Merry Christmas, everyone! Question answered. Oh, hi! Hi! Oh, girls, you have no idea what your being here means to us. We're so excited. Stop it, Athena. Oh, what, look at me. I'm so excited. Now, come with me and I'll give each one of you a task. Oh, this is going to be so much fun! I just can't wait. Have fun, ladies. Aunt Nancy. My baby, oh, it's so good to see you. BOTH: Merry Christmas! Thank you. Listen, Paula. We really, really appreciate you helpin' us out. You're saving out butts. Those extra hands are gonna make a world of difference. Well, they won't be the most cheerful faces in the room. But, they'll get the work done. Speaking of, I was wondering if you could keep an eye on them for me? I have a little Christmas errand to run, and I won't be long. I'll be back before you know it. Um, well, maybe. I mean, I'll do what I can, but, it's a madhouse out there. They should be okay, I don't see them getting into too much trouble at this point. Okay. Thank you! - I'll be right back, okay? - Okay. Well, ladies, I'm sorry to say there's just one last task and it happens to be the least glamorous. As you can see, we have lots of dishes that need to be washed. But, if you try to move through them as quick as you can and then we can move you onto something less messy. Okay? Alright, so there's sponges and there's soap, and it looks like you should be good. Ladies, bless your hearts. Such a big help. You don't even know. Okay, so, I'll be back soon. Awesome. Merry frickin' Christmas. I'll scrape, you rinse? Whatever, let's just get this over with. (CHRISTMAS MUSIC) (OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS) (COUGHS) Alright, guys. There's not a whole lot of strawberries left, so just take one, okay? Yo! I know you're homeless and shit, but don't go gettin' greedy. One each. So, it's really cool that your mom has your back like she does. I wish mine were like that. First conviction, she was out. Yeah. I'm really grateful that she understands the situation. I mean, I think that she knows that I wouldn't do something like that. But, I couldn't just let my friend go down, you know? She doesn't have anybody to support her like I do. You're a good kid, Victoria. You definitely don't belong here. But, hey. You put all this shit behind ya today and bounce back from it. Unlike most of us. Gracie, don't talk like that. This doesn't have to be your whole life. You can change it if you really want to. Easier said than done. Believe me. Here, take these to Athena. (TENSE MUSIC) Mamma's thirsty. Mamma's thirsty. Mm, mm, mm. I can't believe we're doing this. Oh, calm down. It's not like we're skipping class, Candace. We're on probation. For Christ's sakes. The place was so busy that nobody's gonna notice we're gone. Honestly, Victoria, it's perfectly fine. We do this every year. It's tradition. Alright, ladies. Bottom's up. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Ho, ho, ho. (LAUGHTER) Mm. Oh, you are just too slow. Open up, there we go. Like the Holland Tunnel, come on. Woo, that a girl. Jesus. Of all the bars, that douche bag had to come here. Jaxx, my friend over here is thirsty. She's parched, and she needs a cold beverage ASAP. Come on. Thank you. We're gonna make you one of the girls. I got a whole bunch of drinks lined up for you, yes I do. Who's that bitch that he's with? I'm gonna go talk to him. Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second. Seriously, you wanna go down that path? Yeah, I do, just keep your mouth shut, alright, Gracie? I'll be fine. Famous last words. Excuse me, ma'am. It's not polite to glare at the customers. Back off. Babe. Can I talk to you for a minute? What's up? Alone. Harley, can you do us a favor and grab us a few beers. Sure thing, babe. Babe? What? We're just chillin', no big deal. No big deal? Shit, I thought we were on a break, and you're out with some little whore. Look, Candace, you and I both agreed we needed a break. Take a break, not see other people. Your stripper drama really gets to me, okay. Oh, my stripper drama? Yes, yours. Uh-huh. You're a headcase, and you're hard to deal with. What did I do? You're a headcase, do you hear yourself talking right now? - Donny. - Look, look. Can you just go. You are so full of shit. I think that's all you ever do, Donny. You just walk out all the time, you're such an asshole. Wait, wait, Donny. Donny, please don't go yet. Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay. I just don't wanna see you out with other girls. Well, I really wasn't expecting to see you here. I thought you had that probation thing going on. It's our last day, so we're out celebrating. Hey, I'm in the middle of somethin'. Can you talk with your girlfriends? Impressive. You know how I roll, Candace. All it takes it the right incentive. Stop. You're just a frickin' drug dealer with a big dick. You know it. Well, pretty soon I'm gonna be a rich drug dealer. What are you talking about? Come on, I got you somethin'. I feel so much better. I bet. Frickin' Jaxx is tryin' to get you drink and take advantage of you. Are you ready, we gotta go find Candace? Who was that guy she was with? Donny. That douche bag is her on-again off-again ex. He's such an a-hole. Then why is she still with him? Candace has daddy issues. Most dancers do, kind of the MO. She's a stripper? We prefer dancer. Oh, I'm sorry. You're a dancer too? At one time, yes. Not anymore. I don't think I could ever do something like that. No offense, they would eat you alive. You are way too innocent. (MOANING) (SNIFFS) (SNIFFS) (COUGHS) Shit! I gotta get back to the girls. Really, six more hours of this bullshit left and then I'm done. You need a lift? Yeah, sure. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Ladies, oh my goodness, where have you been? I've been looking everywhere for you, and where's your friend Candace? Candace. About Candace, actually, she is in the bathroom. She ate some of that meatloaf that you've been serving, and I just have the feeling like it didn't sit with her very well. Yeah, she's been on the pot for about 45 minutes. And I actually think that she might have the same problem, that's why she can't stand up. Oh dear, not another one. Seems to be a trend today. So, we're here. What did you want us to do? Right now, why don't you just see if you can find a way to entertain the crowds. I know, you could sing! Sing? Attention, attention everybody. Now, I know we're all a little bit busy. However, three of our lovely workers are here to help spread the holiday joy. So, everybody just sit back and enjoy, while they perform for you a stunning rendition of one of your favorite Christmas carols. What are we singing? Well, the First Noel of course. Of course.

We're here with your holiday dinner. You were on the list. MRS. SMITH: List? I don't know anything about a list. I've already eaten. Oh, wait, honestly. We have to spend at least a half hour here. It's part of our duties. So, if there's anything you need done, cleaning or whatever, we're just here to help. MRS. SMITH: It's getting late. We'll only stay until our ride gets here, and then we'll be on our way. It won't be long. Honestly. MRS. SMITH: You said half an hour? If that. Come inside, it's cold out there. Thank you so much. Jesus, it's cold. Okay. So. Oh, here's your food. Oh, thank you. Put it in the kitchen. You know, I heard you singing outside. I was wondering, could you do a carol just for me? Yeah, I think so.

Would you like to try me for some cocoa? Okay. I can't, I'm on a cleanse. Excuse me? Fine, I'll drink your damn cocoa. Language. Great. Well, I guess it looks like we're gonna be staying here for a while. For sure. Has anyone heard from Candace? Whoa, I forgot about her. No. I'll just need to call her. I got it. Okay. I'm on it. Dude, you are really tempting fate tonight. You're so lucky Paula isn't here yet. You need to move your ass. I'll text you the address. Hurry up. Jesus. You don't want your cocoa to get cold, dear. So, what kind of a boss makes you work so late on a Christmas eve? Paula. Our parole officer. Parole officer? Yeah, it's out last night of community service. That doesn't make your efforts any less appreciated. So, how's the cocoa? It's delicious, thank you. It's my own special recipe. So, if you don't mind my asking, tell me, what did you do to get in trouble. Oh, I got in trouble for trying to suck a cop's dick for cocaine. Well, that would certainly get you on the naughty list. Honey, I am the naughty list. That's not something to be proud of, dear. And what about you? Are you as bad as your flamboyant friend over there? Theft. I got caught shoplifting at this new high end store downtown. I wasn't used to the layout. I slipped up and I got caught on that stupid, high tech hidden camera. I didn't get four steps from that place and those cops were all over my ass. Pigs. Naughty, naughty. Thou shalt not steal. But, I suspect that's a verse in a book you're not familiar with. And what about you? You don't look like the type to be running with this kind of people? What kind of stupid mistake did you make? It's just that. A stupid mistake. We all make them, dear. I guess so. My friend and I, we were coming home from a party on the East Side. She drove, but, by the end of the night she was drunk. I didn't wanna risk her gettin' behind the wheel, so, I took the keys away. Only thing was, I was three months out from getting my driver's license. I guess the cop that was behind me knew. He pulled me over and asked me for my ID and I just didn't know what to say. Not to mention that I had a couple drinks myself. It's just not really one of those things you can talk yourself out of. Well, I think what you did was very admirable. I'm sure you won't be on the naughty list this year. (SIGHS) So, you have a very beautiful home. How long have you lived here, like, 500 years? Thank you. All my life. Why do you ask? No reason, I'm just tryin' to make small talk. It really is a lovely house. You're just what I needed on a lonely Christmas Eve. You don't have anybody to spend Christmas with? No. I never married and I have no children or grandchildren. It's just me. And the cats. Oh. I'm sorry. Oh, don't be. Listen, if that offer of help is still good, I could really use some help cleaning up around here. My knees were so bad I couldn't get the floors the way I wanted to this year. We'd be happy to help. Please tell me you have a mop. And a broom. Ooh, I bet she even flew in on it, huh? This is not my life. You girls are doing a very nice job. I really love your tree. Thank you, it's meant to be appreciated. This is a really interesting doll. Oh, that's not a doll, dear. It's a precious antique. Do you have a lot of old decorations? I suppose, up in the attic. I'd really love to see them. Do you think that we could put more decorations on your tree? Honey, I can't climb up all those stairs to the attic. That's okay, Gracie can do it. Alright, I'll show her where the attic is. Jeez. It's not that one, dear. Well, you have so many damn doors. In my father's house, there are many mansions. Okay, listen, no offense or anything, but could you save the scripture quotes for your penuchle friends? It's not that one either. What is that smell? My cat. She died last week, and I haven't been able to give her a proper burial. So, put her in the trash. I never. Okay. The attic is over here. (OMINOUS MUSIC) I'm not goin' up there, it's dark. Light switch is on the right. Hello? Hey, I found your bulbs. Hey, somebody's up here. I have your balls. Mrs. Smith, serious. Hey. Hello? (KNOCKS ON DOOR) Mrs. Smith, come on. Athena, Victoria, I'm upstairs. You guys, hey. Mrs. Smith, come on, let me out! Come on, this is not funny, let me out of here. Come on, let me out. What the hell was that? I don't know. The door sticks sometimes. Okay. Well, I found your balls. Thank you. Alright, selfie time. My new best friend. Oh, I love you so much, you're so horrible. I don't think you should be touching that. Take a photo of us, and I'll put him down. Athena, put the Santa down. What is your problem with me touching Santa? Not that I have a problem with you touching Santa. But, if you drop it and it breaks, then you're destroying a precious antique. Photo. Could you, please. Like that? Yeah. Good light? How do I look? Great? You know, if I did drop this thing and break it, I'd be doin' the old woman a favor. He's disgusting. (PHONE RINGS) Hello? Yeah, I'm just packing up the car now. Why, is something wrong? Well, you had someone escort them, right? No, they can't be left alone unchaperoned. If they get in trouble, that could be on me. I know, I know, I shouldn't have left. I was just trying to do something nice. Look, I'll be there in a minute. Thank you for calling me and telling me. I'll see you soon. (KNOCKS ON DOOR) (BELL CHIMES) MRS. SMITH: Yes? CANDACE: Hi. MRS. SMITH: You must be Candace. That's me. I should've known from the outfit. Hello. That would give it away, wouldn't it? Well, fa la fucking la. Donny Eight Ball. Well, merry Christmas to you too, Athena. He's not gonna stay all night. He's just coming in to warm up, right? Right? Are you gonna go? Yeah, of course. May I get you a cup of cocoa? (LAUGHS) What's so funny? Oh, well, no. I mean, it's just been a really long time since anybody's offered me cocoa. (LAUGHS) Can I talk to you for a minute? Oh, shit. Jesus. Look at me. - Look at me. - Alright. Dude, you are high as a kite right now. I know. What the hell are you thinking? You need to sober up right now, because Paula is on her way here. You think she can tell? Yeah. Go. Go. Get your hands off me. Candace, go. You don't. Bathroom? First door on the left. Thanks. Hi, Paula. Come in, we've got a really cool lady. I found you guys. Finally. What is that? Just a little ho, ho, ho. Where are the other girls? I don't know. Mrs. Smith? Paula, I want you to meet the woman who lives here. She's so sweet. I just don't know where she went. Hey, Paula. Hey, Gracie. Where's Candace? She spilled some cocoa on her dress. She wanted to get it out before it stained. Gracie, do you know where Mrs. Smith went? I have no idea. Maybe she went upstairs. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Hello, Candace. Did you get the stain out? Yeah, I think so. I'm good. Well, listen. Now that you all are here, I just wanna get this over with. I know this is the complete opposite of what I should be doing right now, but, I really enjoyed out time together, as I do every year. And, even though this is supposed to be a punishment, I just wouldn't feel right parting ways tonight if I didn't give you a little something. You know, for the holidays. I'm going to stop talking now. Here. I get way into the holiday. I can't help it. Merry Christmas, girls. Oh, yes. Oh. No, seriously. It's the first nice gift I've received in a long time. I love it. PAULA: You must be Mrs. Smith. MRS. SMITH: Yes, and you? I'm Paula. I'm the girls' parole officer. Being it's their last day of probation, I wanted to give them their Christmas gifts. I hope you don't mind. No, of course not. It's a very nice necklace you have there. Yeah. It is nice getting a gift from someone who's not related to you. I just like getting a gift. One could only imagine. May I get you a drink of water? Yes, please, that would be wonderful. Baby. Look. What's wrong, Victoria? I don't know, it's just that Mrs. Smith was just talking to us about how she didn't have anybody to spend the holidays with, and now that I think about it, that probably means that she doesn't have anyone to give her a gift either. I love the necklace, Paula, it's beautiful. I just feel guilty about opening it in her house without having something for her as well. Do you wanna run out really quick and grab a little something for Mrs. Smith. I'd love that, Paula. Alright, well, let's do it before she notices we've gone. Alright, girls, you be good. Bye, guys. We'll see you soon. You are so lucky Donny heard her coming. If Paula would've caught him here. I know. Donny, she's gone, you can come down now. Donny. The hell is he doing up there? I'm gonna go grab him really fast. Oh, Candace. What? That dead cat, first door on the right. Thanks. I love Christmas. It's just so festive, so magical. Yeah. Christmas has been kind of rough for my family since my dad lost his job at the mill. We kind of stopped celebrating Christmas. We just couldn't afford it. But, you get used to it. I'm sorry, Victoria, I didn't mean to bring it up. No, no, it's okay. Honestly. Gifts or not, I still love this holiday. It's not about the presents anyway. That's true. But, it's always nice to know that someone's thinking of you. Yeah. I know. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Donny? Donny? Donny? You in here? - What is wrong with you? - Sorry. Jesus Christ. Been walkin' around this house. You know, the lady who owns this place? I'm pretty sure she's nuts. I heard her talkin' to herself in the other room. Yeah, there's something not right about her. Gracie told me that she's got a dead, rotting cat - up here somewhere. - What? Yeah, right. That's weird. - Batshit crazy. - Yeah. So. Paula took Victoria to go get that old lady a gift. Really? That was nice of her. I thought so. You know, that reminds me of something. What? I got you a gift too. You did? And, what did you get me? Close your eyes. Let me guess. It's a pair of panties, isn't it? You know me too well. I do. Why don't you slip them on for me? Why don't you watch. Ooh. CANDACE: Do you like 'em? Oh yeah.

Oh, this, it's an old family recipe. Oh, I'm sorry. Ow, ow, ow, ow. MRS. SMITH: You can clean up in the bathroom. Everything okay? I'll bring you something. Give me the clothes. I can put them in dryer. They'll be ready in half an hour. I'm so sorry. Good timing. Mama's gotta go shopping. I thought she said she didn't have any family. Didn't you hear that noise? Everything okay in there? Sounds like you had a little spill. (MOANING) Did you just come too? Donny, you didn't pull out. Yeah, I did. You just came inside of me. Donny, Jesus Christ, I'm not on birth control. You can't get me pregnant again. Where'd I put that? Come here. Did you come, Donny? Yeah, I did. And I'll do it again. She's gonna be forever.

I'm going to make you the way you always wanted to be. ATHENA: Get the fuck away from me! Keep away from me! No! Guys! Guys. Paula! Paula! Call the police. Help! We're back. Guys? Hello? Guys? Athena? Candace. Gracie? I don't know where they went. Maybe they're upstairs. Ladies. Mrs. Smith? Hello? Hello? Where is everyone? I have no idea. You think they left? They better not have. And Dorothea left her pots boiling on the stove. That's not very smart. No, it's not. Did you shut the stove off? Yeah, why? I smell something burning. Oh my God, what is that? It smells awful.

(TENSE MUSIC) (FIRE CRACKLES) (TENSE MUSIC) (GUN FIRES) Merry fucking Christmas, you crazy old bitch. Are you two alright? Good, you're lucky. That's a dangerous woman back there. Or, at least she was. Who was she? Her name is Dorothea Krimble. She escaped from a mental asylum a few days ago. But, not before she set fire to the whole place. There was so many bodies that were burned, that they didn't trace it to her until a few hours ago. They thought she had perished in the fire as well. She's been on the run ever since. Looks like she's been masquerading as the original occupant. Hold on, no offense, I just need to know, what the hell are you doing here and why do you have a gun? I'm a police officer, actually. Surprised, right? Anyway, I always pack heat. I always say it's better to be safe than sorry. You two doin' okay. You're good, right? Okay. Okay, I just need to sit tight. I'm gonna go call for backup. Okay? (SIRENS WAIL IN THE DISTANCE) VICTORIA: Can we just go home?
