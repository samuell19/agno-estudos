This happened last year, about a week before Christmas. The Harper family lived in a charming community called Balboa, about fifty miles from Los Angeles. Early one morning, Mrs Harper took her car, and drove to Los Angeles, and... Mother? Mother? Where are you going? Is Mr Darby in? Mr Ted Darby. - What's the name? - Mrs Harper. I'd like to see him. Just a second. If there's any calls, you know... Oh, excuse me, honey. - You know where you can reach me. - Okay, I'll tell her. Mr Darby wants you to wait for him in the bar. The bar? Every time we get a new singer, Joe... This television is a big thing. He took me for a fifty last night. I don't think the game was on the level. Too early to serve anything yet, Miss. That's all right. It won't be long. Ten minutes. Morning. - Morning. Bar? - In the bar. Mrs Harper? - Yes. - Ted Darby. - Pete. - Ten minutes. - So you're Bee's mother. - Yes I am, Mr Darby, and I... I never realised she had such a young mother. There's quite a resemblance. I'm sorry I can't offer you a drink. I didn't come to make a social call, Mr Darby. What I have to say won't take a minute. As you please. I don't want you to see my daughter again. Isn't that something for Bee to decide? I don't think so. She's only a child. Only seventeen. Eighteen next month. Only seventeen, Mr Darby. And it's plain to see she's not old enough to know what's good for her. Mrs Harper, there's no harm. Bee likes to get around, meet interesting people. I can do that for her. She can get along very nicely without you. You're not the kind of person I want Bee to see. I hope you're not judging by my temporary surroundings, Mrs Harper. My apartment... I know the kind of man you are, Mr Darby. I've gone to the trouble to find out. How does Bee feel about all this? I haven't discussed it with her, and I don't intend to, because you're going to stop seeing her. I am? Yes, and there's nothing I won't do to stop it. - Maybe we should talk this over. - There's nothing to talk over. Yes, there is. You've been pretty frank and I'm going to be the same. I didn't know how strongly you felt about my seeing Bee, and now that I do, I want to co-operate. I want to help you. I think with a little common sense we can get this all straightened out. Straightened out? Just how important is it to you that I don't see her anymore? It's very important. I mean, as far as money is concerned. Otherwise I couldn't possibly promise not to see her again, Mrs Harper. You won't have to, Mr Darby. You've made it very simple for me. I can discuss it with her now, and I'll have nothing to worry about, when she hears how deeply you feel about her. Goodbye, Mr Darby. Operator. Get me Balboa. Harbour 2626. Miss Beatrice Harper. Hey, Mother. How come you went up to Los Angeles this morning and didn't tell any of us? I had some things to attend to. I'm going to put on a new bumper, Mother. I think you're too late. And put on your shirt, David. Okay. Hello, Father. How's everything? Why didn't you tell us you were going to LA this morning? I, er... I wanted to get to the store before the crowds. Sybil, will you turn that vacuum cleaner off? I can't hear the race results. I don't know why you want to hear them, Mr Harper. - Hello, Mrs Harper. - Hello, Sybil. You never win, anyhow. Sybil, where is Bee? She hasn't talked to anyone all afternoon. She's in your room, Mrs Harper, using your shower again. - Is that you, Mother? - Yes, Bee. When you're through with your shower, I'd like to talk to you. I know. What do you mean, you know? Mother, how could you humiliate me so terribly by going to see Ted? It was a little humiliating for me, too. I'm not used to dealing with people of his kind. Do you know what kind of a man he is? Yes, I know. But you're going to tell me he's a low, vile character. He is. That he lives in a horrible, dirty hotel. When Ted called, he told me that's about what you'd say. Now wait a minute. I said wait, Bee. Did your friend Mr Darby also tell you he was perfectly willing not to see you again, providing I made it worth his while financially? I don't believe it. You don't think I'd make up a thing like that, do you? Ted said you made such a scene. He said you got all upset and excited. You might have misunderstood. I didn't misunderstand anything. He made his intentions perfectly clear. Mother, you think you understand people, but you really are terribly old-fashioned. You couldn't possibly understand a man like Ted. I wouldn't want to. Sybil! Did you do my flowers yet? I haven't been able to get to it yet, Bee. Well, I asked you a whole hour ago. Bee, you'll not talk like that to Sybil. Sybil, you don't have to do the downstairs today. Let's not lose our tempers, let's be reasonable. That man... Mother, I don't care to discuss it anymore. It's not a question of whether you care to discuss it. You are not to see that man again. You must give me your promise you won't see him again. I can't promise that, Mother. No? Then you're not going back to Los Angeles. I'll take you out of art school. - You wouldn't do such a thing. - I just did. That won't keep us apart. We'll see each other somehow. Oh, Bee, stop acting. You're not to see him again. That's final. Now, get dressed and pick up your clothes. Mother, can't you trust me? I'm not having a nasty love affair with him, if that's what you think. Bee, I've been stupid and indulgent. Your father wanted you to go to college and I took your side and persuaded him to let you go to art school, which he felt was wrong, because of the freedom and the people you'd be exposed to. I mistakenly thought you were right-thinking enough to be discriminating about the friends you chose. Well, he was right, and I was wrong. You never would have met Darby if we'd listened to him. I know it's difficult for you to understand, because you're still a child. I probably would have felt the same way at your age. The difference is that when you're seventeen today, you know what the score is. You're not a child anymore. Bee, I'm not going to sit here all day and go over the same thing again and again. - You're not going to do... to see that... - Mrs Harper, phone! Philadelphia calling. That's your father. How's it going with you, son? What? You are, Tom? Wonderful. - Can I talk to him, Grandpa? - Wait a minute, Tom. Here's David. Hi, Dad. Swell. Huh? - You oughtta see it. It's almost a car now. - Let me talk to him, David. Hold it. He's in Philadelphia. He was telling me all about his car. Tom? How are you, dear? I'm fine. - We're all fine. - Yes. There's just one little problem. Bee wants a blue Christmas tree for Christmas, and the rest of us are holding out for a green one. How do you vote? What, you won't be here? Berlin? Oh, Tom, you can't be away for Christmas! I don't care, Tom. They've done without that bridge over there for four years. I should think they could do without it for another two weeks. I'm sorry. I know it's what we've wanted. - It's wonderful, Tom. Wonderful. - Dad's been ordered to Berlin, Bee. Yes, she's here. Wait a minute. Here, dear. David just told me. Oh, we're going to miss you. Yes, I'm fine. Art school? Ah, well... well, I'm getting along beautifully. Owen? Oh, I haven't seen him. I haven't seen anyone lately. I've been too busy. Mother wants to talk to you. Hurry home. Tom? What? I think she's taking art school a little too seriously. I'll tell her, dear. And don't worry about anything, darling. We'll all be fine. Goodness, Tom, this isn't anything. You were away three years during the war. Oh, you know I do, Tom. Bye, darling. I'll write tonight. Yes? It's me, Mother. Just a second. Now you can come in. I wanted to say good night. Why aren't you wearing your slippers? I'm hardening my feet for track. - Good night, dear. - Night. I'd like to see you once fully dressed. Writing to Dad so soon? Boy, grown-ups sure can be gooney. You talked to him just this afternoon. - I don't get it. - Because we're gooney. - Night, dear. - Night. David, you smell like a garage. I take a shower every morning. Yes, but I have to sleep with you every night. Ted. Ted, where are you? Here, in the boathouse. - Where are you? - In here, Bee. Where? - Over here. - I can't see you. Here. Bee? When I got home, she made such a scene. She said I... I had to promise never to see you again. That... That you weren't interested in me at all. All you wanted was money. And if she paid you, you'd never see me again. That's not true, is it? As a matter of fact, Bee, I am desperate for money. No. What a horrible thing to say. Now look, if your mother does give me the money, that doesn't mean that I won't see you again. Let go! Let go! But, Bee, it doesn't mean... Bee. You don't understand. Bee? Bee! Bee, where were you? What's the matter? What happened? I hit him. Baby, calm down, calm down. Who was it? It was Ted. I just... Mother, you were right, I know. - I never should have gone to see him. - All right, all right. Just try to tell me what happened. I was at the boat house, and I... All he did want was the money. - I hit him. - All right, dear. - Where is he now? - I don't know. I left him there. You go on upstairs. I'll be up in a minute. Can I help you, Mrs Harper? No. No thanks, Sybil. Was he out there? No. He's gone. Oh, Mother, I wish I'd never gone. I wish... Don't talk about it anymore, dear. It's over. Come on to bed. Come on, Bee. It was so awful. I just could never go through a thing like that again. You won't have to, dear. I promise you. I'll get you a hot water bottle. It will help you to sleep. What's all the running up and downstairs, Lucia? Nothing, Father. Bee isn't feeling well. - I'm a growing boy. I need my rest. - Go back to bed, David. I said go back to bed. Mother, can I have a piece of chocolate cake? Good night, David. Good morning, Mrs Harper. Good morning, Sybil. You're up awful early this morning. I couldn't sleep. Can I fix you some breakfast? No thanks, Sybil. You go back to bed. I'm going for a walk. Yes'm. Mother! Mother! You shouldn't have gone out on the boat! Why not? I haven't put in the new spark plugs yet. Which, incidentally, I bought with my own money, and you owe me fifty cents for. I'll pay you back. Roll down your pants and button your jacket, David. You might have got stuck out there. Well, I didn't. So don't worry about it. I think I'll put those plugs in right now. What were you doing out at the crack of dawn? - Father, I... - More coffee, Mr Harper? Sybil, you know I drink tea. Really Lucia, you were taking an awful chance on that boat. I think David has been fooling around with that outboard motor. Probably got most of it in his car. What anyone wants to get up at dawn for! - Mrs Harper? - Yes? I want to add something to that shopping list we made last night. Oh, I have it right here. Well, I had it. I know you put it in your pocket so you wouldn't forget it like the last time. - I know. - Mother? Was the anchor in the boat this morning? - I don't know. - Somebody swiped it. Who'd steal an anchor? I don't know, but it was in the boat yesterday. - If Mother didn't see it... - Never mind, David. We'll get a new one. Bee? Yes, mother? Good morning. Bee, I want to talk to you a minute. - David and Grandfather didn't...? - No, dear. That's I want to talk about. Bee, did you ever tell anyone you were going with Ted Darby? - No. - Good. How I ever could have been fooled by that low, vile... Stop it, Bee. I know how you feel. but you mustn't talk against him or about him to anyone. You mustn't even mention his name. Do you understand? I'd rather die than have anyone know I ever knew him. Bee... is there anything about last night that you haven't told me? No. No, there's nothing. You're sure? Yes. Go down to breakfast, dear. You're late. - Aren't you coming? - I'll be right down. Lucia, you know, we must make a point of seeing a lot of each other during the holidays. - Mrs Feller. - We'll try. Owen will be home from school tomorrow, and I know he'll be dying to see Beatrice. - We'll do that. Cathy. - We can't ship it like this. - Beatrice has always liked Owen. - Well, Owen has always liked... What's the matter with it? I did the best I could. You might have done the best you could, Mrs Feller, but the best is none too good. All I want from this Post Office is delivery, not philosophy. Take a look, a little excitement. - Lucia, doesn't it look all right to you? - I think he'd know, Catherine. You'll find some cord on that table by the window. What happened? Ex art-dealer murdered in Balboa. Well, what do you know? A murder. - Three-cent stamp, please. - Sure. There you are. A murder, eh? Where? Right over on the other side of the highway. A murder right here in Balboa. - Next. - Who was the guy anyway? Some character by the name of Darby. What do you want with this letter? What? Oh, it's going to Berlin. - How much will it be? - I'll have to weigh it. Does this Post Office furnish Scotch tape? Do they... do they say who did it? No, but they've got some ideas. They know all about that Darby. Hey, here's your change. - Give me one please, Bob. - Here you are, Mrs Harper. Sure is a nice tree you got there. Guess you're all set for Christmas now. - What did you say? - I guess you're all set for Christmas. Yes. Sybil, the, er... the tree is on the car. Would you ask David or Mr Harper to bring it in, please? Yes'm. There's a gentleman been waiting. Who? Er... a Mr Donnelly. Donnelly? Yes? - I'm waiting for Mrs Harper. - I'm Mrs Harper. My name is Donnelly. Martin Donnelly. I'd like a few words with you. Yes, what about? Do you mind? You'll be wanting these, Mrs Harper. What are they? Writings. I don't know what you're talking about. These are letters which your daughter wrote to the late Ted Darby. The price is five thousand dollars. Cash. "Ted, darling. "I just wasn't alive until I met you. "But you came like a fresh wind blowing through my stuffy room. "I don't know, Ted, if I can make up my mind "to do what you asked yesterday." I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave, Mr Donnelly. Would you like me to call the police? I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mrs Harper. "But just the fact that you did ask, "and you thought I had the courage to take such a chance "makes me feel proud. "Ted, I'm thinking about it. "I'm not sentimental, you know that, "but, just the same, it is hard to break entirely with the past." - Hi, Mother. - David. I got trunks on. Hi. - This is my son David, Mr Donnelly. - Hello. Hi. I learned a new song today. Want me to play it? Some other time, David. I'm busy. All right. Mother has no appreciation for music. Hey, Mother, you read about the murder? Yes, David. Oh, glamour girl. At last there's some excitement for you. A guy got bumped off right near here. Excuse me a minute. Who? Who was it? - Ex-art dealer. Ted Darby. - Give me that. - What are you doing? Cut it out! - Give it to me! Bee, no! Bee, stop it! Now she'll call all her arty friends in LA and tell 'em it happened in her own back yard. If we're not to be interrupted again, I'll continue. You don't have to continue, because those letters don't mean a thing. She's only a child. They don't mean anything. Mrs Harper, you don't seem to understand. The man these letters were written to has been murdered. The police will be greatly interested. "Ted, dearest, I am frantic. "The other day I started to talk to Mother about you. "And it was just awful. She wouldn't understand." How did you get these? Darby wanted to borrow some money from us. I didn't think the letters were worth anything. But there was not much else the man had to offer, so we took them off him until he was ready to pay us back. Sort of collateral, you know. Well, you might say it was a bit of luck for us his getting murdered like that, because now the letters will realise much more than we lent him. As Mr Nagel would say, we want to liquidate our stock while the market is high. Mr Nagel's my partner. He's a good businessman. Lucia! Where do you want me to put it? Oh. This is Mr Donnelly. - He's from Tom's office. - Ah, you know my son? Isn't it great about his going to Berlin? How do you do? I'm terribly sorry you can't stay for dinner. - Oh, you're not staying for dinner? - No. Oh, that's a big mistake. - Sybil is making beef and kidney pie. - But, Father... You're very kind, but I have someone waiting. - Are you from Ireland, Mr Donnelly? - I was born there. Then we have something in common. I'm from Boston. Is that right? As long as you can't stay for dinner, the least we can do is give you a drink. Thank you. Mother? May I talk to you for a minute? Go ahead. I can wait. - Mother, it's all about him. - Shush. Not here, Bee. Mother, it says such terrible things... It's nothing to do with you. He was a jailbird, and he was arrested. - I know. - And that ugly art... It was nothing to do with you. Please listen to me. - Whatever happened to that man... - I'm glad he's dead! Don't say that. Don't ever say that. Mother, I... There's something I didn't tell you. Bee, whatever happened to that man has nothing to do with you. Nobody knows, just you and I. So please put it out of your mind. Mother, wait a minute. I wrote to him. I wrote a lot. They'll find the letters. No. No, they won't. No-one will find anything. I promise you. It's been rotten, it's awful. - Get ready for dinner, Bee. - I can't go to dinner. All right, I'll bring you something later. Is that gentleman staying for dinner? No, and I hope Father doesn't ask him again. David, stop it. And get dressed for dinner. Sybil's almost ready to serve. In summertime the kids have a marvellous time in the boats. I can believe that. I really must be going. - Oh, but I haven't had a chance to hear... - Father, I'll tell you all about it later. I'll be seeing you again Mr Harper, very likely. Mrs Harper's going to help me look for a house out here. - Good. - Tomorrow. Lucia, did anyone get the paper? I want to get the results of the fourth race at Tropical Park. Gold Admiral. Paid 6.60. And Mr Harper, at Caliente, Sunday. Rolling Hills in the fifth race. To win. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. - Good night, Mr Harper. - Good night. I can't... I can't see you tomorrow. Where shall we meet? You can't come here. I won't have you in my house. I don't have to come back if you give me the money now. I have to have time to think. Could you get in touch with your husband? No. The father-in-law? We haven't got five thousand dollars. You'll think of a way to lay your hands on it. I'll... I'll meet you at the real estate agency. Tomorrow. It's the one next to the drugstore. Nine o'clock. Nine thirty. All right, Mrs Harper. Good night. Bee has gone up to her room, Mother, and won't come down. I know. What's been bothering Bee the last few days, Lucia? The artist is starving in her garret tonight. Er... nice fellow. Was his name O'Donnelly or just plain Donnelly? Donnelly. David, don't take so much butter. Where did Tom meet him? I don't remember, Father. Tom meets so many people. Is he from Tom's office? I'm not sure. He didn't... What's the matter? I have a headache. David, I told you not to take so much butter. Don't you think you should get up, Bee? Everyone's at breakfast. It's late. I don't want to be there at breakfast. They'll all sit and ask questions. Please, I don't want to go down. Oh, come on, now. Fix your face, and take a shower, and have breakfast downstairs like everybody else. I can't. Can I... maybe go away somewhere for a while? I don't know, Bee. Where could you go? And how would it look, your being away during the holidays? What would David and your grandfather think? If I could go to... Lake Tahoe. To Aunt Edna's. That would be perfectly all right, and they wouldn't think anything. Oh, please. Talk to her, and see if it's all right. Well, maybe. Operator? I want to call Lake Tahoe. Person-to-person call. My number? Coffee's getting cold, Lucia. Never mind, operator. I'll get it. I thought we were supposed to meet at the real estate office. - It's past nine thirty. - I'll be right with you. You've got to eat something before you go out. I can fix that. I didn't even know it had a horn. This will do it. You've been around cars, haven't you, Mr Donnelly? I used to handle quite a lot of them. When they were hard to get. David, go in and finish your breakfast. Thank you, Mr Donnelly. Sybil, the next time the gardener comes, ask him to roll up the hose, please. - Yes'm. - All right. Go back in the house. Why did you come here? We were supposed to meet in the village. I'd like to get this over as fast as I can. - Yes. - We'll have to move faster. Oh, here they are. I'll back my car out. - We'll use mine. - But... We'll use mine. Did you find a way to get the money yet? Please, just drive me to the drugstore. I have a call to make. It's a call I can't make at the house. I understand. - That's bad for your health. - What? You smoke too much. It's going to be hard for me to go to Los Angeles and get the money. I... I promised Father and David the car tomorrow. If I want it, there will be questions. I've been to Los Angeles once this week. That means more questions. You don't know how a family can surround you at times. No, I don't. I have to have time to think. I can't just get the money like... like that. Hi, Mrs Harper. Hello, Mike. I thought I was gonna hear from you, Mrs Harper? What about? I want to get busy on that roof of yours before we get busy. Oh, well, er... We'll talk about it when Mr Harper gets home. Okay. We should have taken my car. Turn left here. There's less traffic. This ought to be deserted enough. My son worked here last summer. Worked very hard. You wouldn't know about that, would you? Sold hamburgers. Saved forty dollars. At least he earned it. Do you never get away from your family? No. But Edna, Bee wouldn't care where she slept, just as long as she was up there. She isn't hard to manage. Bee isn't like that. Edna, I'm the first to appreciate that you're filled up at Christmas, but Bee hasn't been feeling well. No, she isn't sick, but I want to get her away from here. February? No Edna, you... What? Operator, my three...? Hold on, Edna, I have to get some more change. Hold on. I need some change. I'm in the middle of a phone conversation. I've got some dimes, I think. - I think I'll need another quarter. - Here you are. "Less nicotine. Less tobacco stain." Nice. - Do you sell many of these? - Filter holders? Tons of them. Wouldn't it be simpler if you didn't sell the cigarettes? - Are you with Mrs Harper? - Yes. - These are hers. - Oh, thank you. One thing I can't make out. If it's two or three cans of tooth powder. I don't know. - I'll make it three. All right? - All right. And, er... I'll take one of these. Charged? These are charged. I'll pay for that. Hello, Mrs Harper. Hello. Did you remember to put my father-in-law's razor blades...? Did we? Yes, and here's your change. And three makes a dollar. - You ready? - Yes. Goodbye, Mrs Harper. Goodbye, Mr... Watch your wheels. That's it. Was your telephone call successful? Did you arrange anything? I wasn't calling about the money. I have an aunt in Tahoe. I want her to look after Bee for a while. I thought you might have changed your mind about getting in touch with your husband. Will you be doing that? No. I told you. I can't do that. Why? It may be weeks before I can reach him. I wouldn't think there was any place that remote. He's travelling. You can cable him on a boat. Or a train. What do you expect me to do? "Send money, I'm being blackmailed"? My husband will get in touch with me as soon as he can. - I'm afraid we can't wait that long. - Well, I'm afraid you'll have to. I wouldn't even consider trying to raise the money if Bee weren't so... Well... if she wouldn't... Well, you... one has to be careful. Children dramatise things so much. - In this case, she's justified. - That's ridiculous. Her letters mean nothing. You and I, we both know that. Nevertheless, you're anxious that the police shan't see them. Only because it would make her feel... There's the police. They'll be looking for the one who killed Darby. Now, if they should see those letters... Wednesday, Mr Donnelly, please. The banks are closed over the weekend. - There's nothing I can do. - It's too far off. And the car. I've already told you I can't take the car to Los Angeles again. It'll make my family wonder. It's just impossible for me to get away so soon again on my own. - You're quite a prisoner, aren't you? - I don't feel like one. Wednesday, Mr Donnelly. In the years I've been with Nagel, I've seen him handle blackmail deals. Believe me, Mrs Harper, it's best that you do this through me. My partner is not always as patient as I am. Partner. I don't believe you have a partner. If you're on your own, you might at least have the courage to admit it. No, I'm not on my own. We're all involved with each other, one way or another. You have your family. I have my Nagel. How can you say that? You and your Mr Nagel, if he exists, are just a couple of blackmailers held together by a common interest in cheating people. I wouldn't try to raise the money. It's just that Bee... It would be such a shock to her. She's lucky to have a mother like you. Everyone has a mother like me. You probably had one too. - When shall I come for the money? - I'll have to get in touch with you. I'll call you tonight. Don't you understand? You can't call me. I'll do the best I can. I'll try every way. Then I'll send it to you. Just give me until Wednesday. I'll know by then what I can do. I'll see about it. Would you like to have some lunch now? With you? No. - You'll be perfectly safe with me. - Just drop me on the other side. - How will you get home? - Don't worry. I'll manage. There is a Nagel. I give you my word. Thank you very much, Mr Harper. Thank you very much. Sorry we couldn't help any more, Lieutenant. But nobody up at our house ever heard of him. We'll see you again, Mr Harper. You know, it had me completely fooled. I figured he was killed up in LA, and then dumped down here. Well, we know it didn't happen that way, Mr Harper. You mean, because you know he was killed with an anchor? Well that and some other things, yes, Mr Harper. You think he was murdered right here in Balboa, Lieutenant? Yeah, well, maybe. Well, if it happens to be that way, Lieutenant, we'll give you all the help we can. You see, when I was a young man in the Army, I was always interested in crime. Thank you very, very much, Mr Harper. We'll see you again, we'll see you again. Goodbye, Lieutenant. Goodbye now. Cast off. Cast off. All right, come on, you kids. I think you'd better get on home. The excitement is all over. Come on now, no lagging behind there. Come on. What are you all doing here? Oh, we had a little excitement. The police just left. You missed it, Mother. - The police? - Yeah, about that Darby. Routine questioning. What did they want to know? If anyone in the house knew him, or had ever heard of him. You know, it is rather an odd case. I can't figure what that type of man would have been doing in this neck of the woods. We were grilled. My darling, you shouldn't be here. Go home. And I think the rest of you had better go too. Want to come to the house? I've got some new records. No. Go to someone else's house. I liked the Lieutenant, but I'd rather be a fireman. Come on. Why did the police come here, Father? After all, they should know what the man was. Why are they checking private homes? Oh, they seem to believe that he might have been involved with a family in the neighbourhood. Why? Well, he was killed with an anchor. How do they know it was an anchor? The shape of the wound. Besides, they know the body was taken into the swamp by a small boat. Small boat had to come from someplace around here. Have... Have they any ideas? No. I don't suppose they'd tell if they did. You know, somebody saw you out there that morning. What? Yeah. Two fellas fishing. The Lieutenant wanted to talk to you. Why? Oh, to find out if you'd seen anybody. I told him you hadn't or you would have mentioned it. Why are they so interested in anyone being on the water at that hour? They know that it was about that time that Darby's body was moved into the swamp. Mrs Harper. I didn't see anyone. Mrs Harper! Sybil is calling you, Lucia. Telephone! I'm coming. Thanks. Hello? Hello, Mr Donnelly. Is that Mr Donnelly? - Yes. - Ask him for dinner some night. All right, Father. What is it? I understand. You can't talk. Look now, I just called to tell you that he won't wait till Wednesday. He wants the money no later than Monday. And there is a Nagel. I'm afraid there's very much a Nagel. You don't believe me. Listen to me. Listen. If you can get half of it. You don't have to raise... I already told Nagel I wouldn't be wanting my share. And I'd like you to know, too, that if I had the money I'd pay him off and that would be the end of it. Are you there? Did you hear what I said? I wish you would believe me. I wish things could have been different in many ways. Only one good thing came of it. I met you. Which way do you come in to town? I'll meet you at the terminal. Hey, where's the game tonight? I don't know. I'm not playing. Tell him the game will be held in Room 420 tonight. Talk to her? Yes. She'll have the money Monday? She'll try. What do you give me that "she'll try" business for? I told you what to tell her. Let's cut out the horsing around. Maybe I'd better go down there and talk to her. I'm handling this. You lay off. - You're not going near her. - I'm not, huh? No, you're not. You know, this lady is not in your class, Martin. I often think you get mad at me because I remind you of what you are. You're not respectable, Martin. Relax. Take it easy. Plus the payment on the house, plus taxes... Plus telephone bill... Plus piano... Plus electric bill... Plus water bill... Come in. Mrs Harper, you hardly touched a thing at dinner tonight. I thought maybe you'd like this. Thanks. Sybil, I didn't put the things away that I got in town this morning. - Would you, please? - Yes. How do people put aside money so they have it when they need it? Christmas sure makes little numbers out of big ones, doesn't it? Sybil, we've got to cut out down on the lights. That would... Well I mean, we're always leaving the lights on. And the meat bill, Sybil... Oh. I can cancel that suit I ordered. Oh, we can watch it a little more, Mrs Harper. This wasn't on the list. Did you buy this cigarette holder? Oh? No I didn't. I'll take it back. - Good night, Mrs Harper. - Good night. I really wish you'd understand, Mrs Harper. - That kind of a loan... - Hello, Mrs Harper. Hello. For that kind of a loan... may I have your keys, please? We'd have to have your husband's signature. Yes, yes. Of course. If you'd given us a little notice it would only be a matter of a few days. A cable to your husband, you see, would settle the matter. It's all right, Mr Oppenheim. I understand. Could you help me? Whom do I see about making a... I... I'd like to see someone about making a loan. Just a minute. Mrs Loring's free now. She's at the third desk in there. Just go through the gate. Thank you. How do you do? - Won't you sit down, Miss...? - Mrs Harper. Harper. H-A-R-P-E-R? Yes. - I grow them in my garden. - Oh. Now, then. What can I do for you? I want to get a Io... I mean, make a loan... No, get a loan. And how much do you wish to borrow? Five thousand dollars. I see. And, what is the purpose of this loan, if I may ask? Well I... I need the money. I gathered that. Now, what is the money for? Well, really... Your ad said "no red tape". Well, we must know the purpose of the loan, and how you plan to repay it. That's not red tape, is it? No. Now, what is your husband's first name and occupation? I thought it was just a question of my signing a note? Well, how much do you think you could repay every month? Fifty dollars. Mrs Harper, do you realise how long it would take to pay back the sum you ask at that rate? I guess it would take a long time. We couldn't consider it, Mrs Harper, really. Do you have any collateral? A car wouldn't cover it, of course, but... your house? - No, but I have myjewellery. - Oh, I'm sorry. We cannot lend money on jewellery. We don't have a pawnbroker's licence. It's a state law, you know. I see. Well, I guess I won't bother you anymore. Thanks. - Thanks just the same. - Of course. Merry Christmas. Over here, madam. I'd... I'd like to borrow some money on some jewellery. - All right. - Here it is. It's mine. Very nice. Nice setting. - A trifle out of date. - Yes. Hmm. How much do you want on this? As much as I can get. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well? I can give you, um... seven hundred. Seven hundred? But it's worth so much more. Eight hundred. Thank you. Will you... are you going to put the things in the window? Oh, no. Those things in the window are those which the owners haven't redeemed, - or they haven't paid the interest on. - I see. Oh, it's late. Here's your ticket, madam. - You'll need that. - Thank you. Excuse me. Hey, watch it, lady. Keep your eyes open until it's stopped. Bus from San Francisco now arriving Gate 2. I'm sorry I'm late. It took longer than I thought. - That's all right. - No, it's not all right. I could only raise 800 dollars. I won't be taking your money. Did you draw that out of your bank? No, I didn't have it. I pawned some jewellery. Well you can get your things back. All of them. Nagel can't do anything to you now. I... I don't understand what you mean. The police know who killed Darby. They've taken him in. They... they what? It's no bother of yours. He's nothing. They... they've arrested someone? - I'll get you some coffee. - But... Your worries are over now, and I'm glad. You won't have any trouble now. They'll keep the girl's name out of it. The letters have nothing to do with it. Mr Donnelly. Listen to me, please. Supposing he had nothing to do with it, this what's'isname? Murray. He could have been framed. People don't like him. But he's in... he's in jail for it. He'll be tried for it. Don't lose a night's sleep over it. He and Darby... But he can't be punished, can he, for something he didn't do? There is no need for you to worry about it. It's no concern of yours. Coffee, please. One coffee, please. What if he didn't do it? - What if he did? - But he didn't do it. He didn't because... well, you see, he couldn't have. The thing is, they mustn't keep him in jail because he didn't do it. Ten cents. There's two seats in front of us. Let's go and sit down. - Will you have a Coke? - No, I want an ice-cream. Camellia? Buy the lady a camellia, mister. Keep calm now. Take it easy. But he didn't do it. Do you know who did, then? You do know. Come on now. Who was it? You're not going to tell me that you killed him? Yes. Well, no... I mean... Well, you see... Earlier that day, I went to see Darby. I told him he must... never meet her again. I told Bee, too. I said if he ever came near her again, I'd... Well that night, he did come to see her. They... They met at the boathouse. I went there. There was an awful argument, and... You couldn't have killed him. I don't believe you. I did. I did. It was with the anchor. A handy little weapon. I pushed him. I pushed him and he... he fell on it. Later, I had to move him over... How did you move him? He was a big man, Darby. - You couldn't have done that part of it. - Oh, yes, I could. - I did, though I don't know how... - I don't believe you. I can't help it. It's the truth. And now they holding him... All right, all right. So you're a murderess. I believe you, if that's what you want. But you are not to repeat this story to another soul. I want your word on that. How about your family? How will it be for them? Long Beach, Newport, Balboa, Laguna. Now loading. Manhattan Beach, Long Beach, Newport, Balboa, Laguna. Now loading. Listen to me. You're out of it now. Don't you see, you're out of it. You're safe. - But he's innocent. - All right, he's innocent of this. But he's guilty of a hundred other things. So it doesn't matter. It makes no difference. You've got to look at it from all sides. There is your family. You'll have to think out what's going to do them the most good in the end. Forget about him. What's the use of sacrificing your family for a man that's no good, that deserves what's coming to him? If he gets it for this, it's the only good thing he's done in his whole life. Don't be trying to think of the right and the wrong of it. You're not dealing with the kind of people you know. You're dealing with the kind of people I know. This is how it'll be. It's the right thing to do, Lucia. It's the right thing. Just you forget this. If you do what I say it will be over for you. Tonight, I'll have it out with Nagel. You'll have your letters back, - and I'll bring them to the house. - No, please. Please mail them. I'm sorry, but... Of course. I understand. I'll mail them. Thank you. - I'm looking for Nagel. Have you seen him? - In the bar. Hi, Martin. No, no, no, no. Just play the same tune again. The same tune again. I need one card right from the beginning. Where's Nagel? It's your pick. You heard? Murray got sprung a little while ago. What about it? So he went for a little drive. Where did he go? He said he wanted to get some salt air. Your lead. Goodnight, Mrs Harper. - Mrs Harper? - Yes? Mrs Harper. - There's a man here. - Who? He says his name is Nagel. He's not a nice man, Mrs Harper. - Don't you think we ought to call the...? - No! Wh... where is he? He said he wanted to see you alone so I had him wait in the boathouse. - I'll go there. - You'd better tell the folks you're home first. They're awful upset about you being so late. All right. Give him a drink and tell him I'll be down as soon as I can. Yes'm. Lucia, we've been worried sick. The traffic was heavy and the bus was slow. Hey mother, can I have a dollar? A dollar, David? What for? What for? I'm going out. Look at me. A boy of distinction. There's a dollar in my desk drawer upstairs. Take it. But one, not two. Okay, thanks. Where are you going? Owen Feller asked me and Bee to go to the movies with him. The whole gang's going. But the beautiful Beatrice does not choose to go. Why don't you want to go, Bee? Because, Mother. Oh you should go, dear. Owen will be terribly disappointed. I just don't want to. I've eaten and I'm tired. Really, Bee, the right thing for you to do is to go out. I'm too tired to go into it now, but I wish you'd do as I say. Please. - I just can't. - Lucia. Lucia, with Tom away, if you ever want to talk things over... Well, I mean, if you... What I mean is... - I'm here, you know. - I know, Father. I was on my way to bed but if you'd like to catch a late movie? No thanks. Tired? Father? There is nothing wrong that Tom's coming home won't cure. - Good night. - Good night. I'll do those. You go. Mother, I just don't feel like seeing Owen. You don't want to see Owen and I know why. It's ridiculous. Believe me. If anyone ever found out about... We've gone all through that, and there's nothing more to say. You just can't stop living at your age. Come on. I'm not dressed. You look perfectly all right. I'll give you my fur coat. It looks lovely on you. You've got to see people sooner or later, so you might as well start now. - It's just that it's so sudden. - I know, but you must. Hey, she's going? Yes, David. She's going. Attagirl. Come on. Wait a minute, Bee. I want to roll down your sleeves. Hey, there's something in the pocket. Oh, it's just an old shopping list. Shopping list? Huh? Oh, nothing, dear. You'd better hurry. Watch your sleeves. Thank you. Come on. I'll see you when you get home. - Have fun. - Okay. Mrs Harper? Mrs Harper, would you like me to go with you? No thanks, Sybil. I'll wait here and you call me if you need me. All right. - I'm sorry you've had to wait here... - Hello, Duchess. Sure took your time. I couldn't get here any sooner. - What do you want? - Don't you know? This afternoon, Mr Donnelly said that I didn't... You know, you must be a mighty fast talker. Donnelly was a mighty good man until he ran into you. - Now he's gone soft on us. - But he said... Let's skip all the talking. Where's the money? Donnelly said too much. We're right back where we started. Only this time he's out. I'm taking the whole five tonight. I don't know what you mean, "right back where we started". I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, you know what I'm talking about. Now, where's the money? I haven't got it. I can't get it. I don't have to get it. I don't have to get it because you can't do anything to me anymore. Got it. Got it. You might be playing around with Donnelly, but not with me. I tell you, you can't do anything to me anymore. They've got the man who killed Darby. It has nothing to do with my daughter. The letters mean nothing. They've got him. They've got the man they were looking for. - You can't do anything to me anymore. - I've got news for you, Duchess. Murray was sprung this afternoon. I'm going to do what I should have done. I'm going to call the police. And I'll get hold of a newspaper friend of mine and give him these. He'll do the rest. There's nothing the newspapers like more than a beautiful young girl mixed up in a murder case. - She had nothing to do with it. - Then let her prove it. Now, Donnelly may have been willing to make some kind of a deal with you, but not me. I don't care about your daughter, your son, your husband or anybody else. This is a business proposition with me, and I don't leave this place until I have that money in my hand. So make up your mind now. Either you come clean with me, or I take your daughter's letters to the newspapers. It's as simple as that. So let's quit this stalling, huh? I told you to keep away from her. I told you! I told you! You need help. Don't go. I'll get help. You're bleeding. - We've got to get him out of here. - No, no, you're not going to do that. - We've got to get him out of here. - No, you can't. It's useless. We've got to call the police. No, no. You don't understand. I'll tell them the whole story. Everything that happened. I'll tell them it's my fault, not yours. That you did it for me. I'll tell them that. They'll understand when I tell them everything. It's me and Nagel they'll understand. They know our kind. - You're not like him. - He was better than I was. He had no illusions about himself. I never killed a man before. Do you know that when I was a boy, my mother wanted to make a priest of me? She had five sons, and would never learn that I was the bad one. I never did a decent thing in all my life. I never even wanted to until you came along. Then I began to think, if only I could turn back and start over. So, what happens? As soon as I try to start back, I find myself with this on my hands. Let's take it as a hint Lucia, and don't make the same mistake my mother made. You don't know me, Lucia. The police, they know me all right. No, I can't let you take this on yourself and be hunted for murder the rest of your life. I got you into this. It's my way of doing something that's made everything wrong. I'll tell them that. I'll tell them about Bee and Darby. I'll tell them about you. It's the only way. Before you do that, do you mind getting me a drink? I could use one. Be right back. What happened down there, Mrs Harper? It's all right. Go upstairs and get some bandages. - Mr Donnelly has been badly hurt. - Mr Donnelly? Yes, but hurry, and be careful about Mr Harper. Hurry, Sybil, hurry! Come on! I thought it was in the bathroom. - I couldn't hurry. - All right, all right. Do you want me to go with you? - You'd better take your coat. - No, Sybil, no. Donnelly! Sybil, Sybil, my car keys! Hurry! You would not have helped him with the police, Mrs Harper. I'd lie. I wouldn't tell them about the blackmail. I liked Mr Donnelly. He wouldn't listen to me. If only he would listen to me. Where? On the right side. I see. Something's happened. Stop. Donnelly! Go back to the car, Lucia. Go back! Go back, go back! Get away from me. Sybil, start the car and get help! No, you can't move that. It's pinned underneath. But it's only on the arm. I got these off Nagel. No, no. Don't do that. Leave me just as I am. No, don't even touch me. You mustn't be found here when help comes. You must get away from here. Now listen carefully. Listen carefully, Lucia. Don't you understand? Everything's turned out all right. Finding Nagel here, they'll never know what happened. It'll be... He was with me when I had the accident. But you'll spoil everything if you're here when they come. Ah, now, you must have courage, Lucia, and leave me. You'll spoil everything if you stay. It will all be for nothing. Everything will be all right for me in a few minutes. They'll take me to the station. The doctor will fix me up there. But you must get away from here. Go on. Hurry, Lucia. Go on now, Lucia. Hurry now. Go on, get away. I can't. Hurry, Lucia. Go on. Go on now. Go on. Come on, Mrs Harper. I'll drive. Oh, Bee. Mrs Harper? Telephone! Berlin calling. It's Mr Harper. He's on the phone. What's happening? - Mother, we saw a terrible accident. - Quiet, David. - It's Mr Harper, Berlin. - Dad? Mother, we had to make a detour. The police said... The police said that the man who was in the accident confessed to killing Darby. And they got to him just before he died. And Mother, they told me who it was. Here she is. Just a second, Dad. What's going on down there? - It's Dad, Grandpa. - Oh. Tom? Tom, we've mailed your Christmas packages. We're going to have a blue Christmas tree. And everything's fine, except... We miss you terribly. Yes, Tom... SUBTITLES BY POWERHOUSE FILMS LTD
