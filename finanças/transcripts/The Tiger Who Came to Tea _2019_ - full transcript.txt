What a mess! I'm never gonna clean all this up. Once there was a little girl called Sophie, who was sitting in the kitchen with her mummy. - Come on, Mummy. Let's go. - OK, Sophie, I'm coming. Now, have I got everything? - Bag? - Bag. - Purse? - Purse. - Keys? - Keys _ Ooh. Who can that be? Daddy! Forgot my keys. Keys? Where are they? Ooh! - I found them! - Oh! Silly Daddy. Thank you, darling. OK, have fun! Bye! - Hm. - Oh! Yes, that's... Hmm. Oh, oh, oh, oh! Bus! Bus! Bus! Ready? Let's go. Hooray! Oh! What's Daddy forgotten now? Good morning! - Oh, morning. - We're going to the park! There are swings and a seesaw and a roundabout. Cor, that sounds like fun! Can I come too? - How much is it this week? - Same as usual. Uh-oh. Ooh, I don't like the sound of that. Oh! Oh, well. I better dash. Oh, dear. Come on. Let's make some cakes instead. Hmm! Ooh! Hmm! Ooh! Hm... Now, what are we going to do with all these cakes? Hm... I know. Why don't w've a tea party? Just the two of us. Really? A tea party? Yay! We'll have all the biscuits and buns we made earlier. - And the best china. - Ooh! And some sandwiches. Ooh, yes. And of course the cake you decorated so beautifully. - But that's for Daddy. - He won't mind if we've just a bit. OK. Just a little bit, though. Some milk with your tea, madam? Thank you. Just a splash. - Ooh. - Ooh! I wonder who that can be. - It can't be the milkman. - Good morning! Because he came this morning. And it can't be the boy from the grocer because this isn't the day he comes. I come Tuesdays! And it can't be Daddy because he's got his key. Ah! We'd better open the door and see. Excuse me, but I'm very hungry. Do you think I could have tea with you? Er... Of course. Come in. Mm. Mmm. 'Ooh! ' Ugh! Hm. Oh! Hm. Oh. Mmm. Hm. I'll just get another plate. Hm. I do hope there's enough to eat. Mmm. Huh! Oh, dear. I hope you haven't caught a cold from all the rain. Mmm. Hm. Mmm. Would you like a sandwich? Hm. Or two? Hm. Have one of these! Mummy made them. Hm. Hm? Mmm... I made these all by myself. Hm. Mmm. Hm. Hm? Mmm! Hmm. Would you like a little piece of cake? Hm... Mm! Hm. You were supposed to eat that bit. Hm? Hm. I think he's thirsty, Mummy. Would you like a drink? What about a cup of tea? And do you take...? ...milk? Sugar? Tea? Oh, careful, it's a bit... hot. Ooh, you're all soft. Hmm. Can you growl? I can growl. Do you want to hear me? - Wow! - Mm. I really like your teeth. They're so long and pointy. Can I touch them? Ooh! Hmm. Hm? I knew I should have made more sandwiches. Hm... Mmm. Hm. He drank all the milk! And all the orange juice. And all Daddy's beer! Hm. Hmm. He can't still be thirsty. Ugh! You're all sticky! Come on. Follow me. Hmm! Hm? Mmm, mmm. Would you like me to brush your teeth for you? Mummy won't mind if we use hers. Now, open wide. Ahh-hhh! Eee-eee... Hm. I think you're beautiful. You can stay here forever if you like. You can come to my school. We can go to the seaside. And you can sleep on my bed. Once there was a little girl called Sophie... Sophie. Sophie .7' Sophie .7' Ah! Thank you for my nice tea. I think I better go now. - Mm. - Goodbye. Bye-bye. I don't know what to do. I've got nothing for Daddy's supper. The tiger has eaten it all. Oh, well, time for your bath, Sophie. Hm. That's odd. The tiger drank all the water in the tap. Oh, of course. I wish he could have stayed, Mummy. Let's get you ready for bed. I'm home! Daddy! Hello, darling. Oh, what are you up to? - Daddy, did you see him? - See who? The tiger! The tiger? Yes! The tiger who came to tea. The tiger who came to tea? And ate all the food. Not our supper? And drank all the drink. Not my beer as well? - Well, he was really thirsty. - Really thirsty. Oh. Messy tiger. No tea. No supper. No drink. No beer. Hm... Ah! I know what we'll do. I've got a very good idea. We'll put on our coats and go to a caf√©! Here we go, darling. That's it. One arm in and the other arm in. Good girl. Can I have sausage and chips? Yes, and ice cream with chocolate sauce. Can I have a pint of beer? After you. Oh! Nearly. Now, look both ways and... Whee! Good night, Mr. Pether. Er, good night, Miss Harding. The doorbell went, then he poked his head round the door... - Thank you. - ...and then he did a roar! Do you mean like this? And then he sat down and ate all the food on the table. - He didn't. - After that he was very sticky. In the morning Sophie and her mummy went shopping and they bought lots more things to eat. And they also bought a very big tin of tiger food... ...in case the tiger should come to tea again. But he never did.
