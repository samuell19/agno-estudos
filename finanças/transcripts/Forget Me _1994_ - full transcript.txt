FORGET ME - Hello. - Christelle? It's me. - Was there a call for me? - No. - Are you sure? - Yes. Maybe the line was busy. I tried to call, but the line was busy. It was for me, it lasted two minutes. - You didn't go out? - No. - Nobody called? - No. Okay. There was one call, but the person hung up. - When? What time? - I don't know... half an hour ago. - Did the person hang up before or after you said "Hello"? - After. - Hello? - Yes. - Are you okay? - Yes. I'm going to a party tonight. You wanna come with me? - What party? - I don't know, they'll call me. - Where are you? - In the subway. - What are you doing? - What time is it? - 4:15 PM. - I have to meet Antoine, I have to go. - Call me later. - Yeah, okay. Later. Eric! Hi! - How are you doing? - I'm fine. Hello. - Olivier, Nathalie. Nathalie, Olivier. - Hello. - Are you coming? - It's not my direction. I'm going, see you tomorrow. So you're back. I didn't know. I had barely gotten back when I started working again. Was it good? Yeah, it was calm. - When did you come back? - Last week. I tried to call you, you were not home. Did you try to call me? I went here and there, I was out every day. - Did you try to call me? - No. - Do you want to go to a café? - No, I can't, no. Let's smoke a cigarette tonight. - Can't you smoke a cigarette? - If you want me to. - So? - So? - You don't want to see me any more. - I thought it was easier not to call you. - What is easier? - To change my mind. Change your mind? What's on your mind? You decided to break up with me? I told you several times I was tired of all this. - You were talking about your job. - No, about you and me. I don't get it. I swear, you didn't tell me anything. - You didn't explain it to me. - Okay, if you say so. I didn't tell you. Does it make any difference? Tell me now. Tell me, and it will be over. I don't want to see you any more. It's over. You can't decide it on your own. It's not possible. It is. I don't know. Go away. - Go away! - Okay. Eric. - Can I call you tomorrow? - No. Should I wait a bit longer? - No, just don't. - Can I write? - If you want to. I have to go. - Wait! Have you met someone? No. Would you tell me if you had? No, I wouldn't. But it's not the case. So what is it? Fuck, I don't know. It's just like that, it's nothing. That's the way it is. That's the way it is? It's nothing. That's the way it is. Yes. - Will you be okay? - No, I won't. How could I be okay, asshole! - I'm going. - Go. What is it? Where were you? - Okay, talk to the hand... - I was nowhere. - Let's go. - And the car? At the pound. I'm fed up, Nathalie, I'm tired. Should we go get it? Let's go. - Which pound? - Bonneuil, Fourier's Pound. - You know the way? - No. - Which station? - I don't know. Southern suburbs. Let's look at the map. There's a station in Bonneuil. Let's change at Nation and take an RER. - You have money? - Do you? - Calm down. - We have no money but my checkbook. - I'll write them a dud check. - And what will we do later? I have 150F. If it's not enough, I'll write checks all night long. In 3 days, my account will be suspended, then we'll have something in common. And our life will be easy and beautiful. - Will you be a pain? - I won't, money's just not a godsend. - I'll pay you back. - How? - A job isn't a godsend neither. - One has to earn it, right? Wanna have to look for it... One has two look four it... One has to look for it. - What will you do later? - I don't know. - Go to a party with Christelle. You wanna come? - No. - What do you wanna do? - Nothing. Go home. What would we do at a party? See each other? Party together? What does it have to do with... - Being together. - I don't know. - Why are you like this? - Like what? Like you. Mournful. Indecisive and mournful. - You're floating. Is there anything? - Nothing special. So it's just seeing me? - Show me the 150F. - What for? I'll make a wish. Are you crazy? No, I'm fine. Well, I'm not really fine. - You're insane. - Won't you go get them? No. Go. This is not normal. Why are you doing this? Why make my life a living hell? Go. - I didn't think you would. - I shouldn't have? If I hadn't, I would have been an idiot. I went, and I'm still an idiot. What I do is never good, never enough. I'm a "never enough" guy. - I'm not enough. - Stop. No, you stop! - You keep going on! You stop! - Stop. I don't care about this money. Take it. - Take it, or I'll throw it away. - Throw it away. I will calm down. - Antoine. - What? - What'd you do if I broke up with you? - Nothing. - I wouldn't do anything. I wouldn't move. - Would you wait for me? I might call you again and ask to see you again. - Are you breaking up with me? - Answer me. I would never want to see you again. - Even a long time later? - Yes. How would you feel? I would be miserable. How? Like a rat. I would feel like dying. So you like me. Looks like it. - You are bound to me. - As you say. You love me. Yeah, probably. I'll call Christelle and ask about the party. I'm going home. Come with me if you want. Drop me at a phone booth. - What's gotten into you? - Nothing. Go away, I'm fed up with all this. I can't force you. Come see me when you feel like it. Go away. - Eight minutes. - I know. I keep waiting for him all the time. - Can I go like this? Is this fine? - Yes. - No, look at me, I'm horrible. - Yes, and you stink, it's disgusting. I don't stink, I smell of alcohol. I haven't eaten. - Do you think I'm dirty? - Here he is. - Where? - Over there. - Has he seen us? - I don't think so. Doesn't he feel well? I don't know, maybe he's drunk. - You're sure you don't want to be alone? - No, stay, it's better. Let's meet him then. Did you hurt yourself? Are you ill? No, I'm fine. Nathalie, Fabrice. Fabrice, Nathalie. - Good evening. - Good evening. We've met before. - Yes, I remember. - Are you sure you don't want to go home? I told you I'm fine. Where are we going? - Rocher Street. - You know the place? - No, they just gave me the address. - Who? My little sister. - Will she be there? - Probably. - Her sister is deadly hot. You know her? - Hey, calm down. - What, can't I say your sister is hot? - Enough about my sister. Here we go again. Go ahead, ask what I did today. - "What did you do today?" - What did you do today? Nothing. Nothing at all. I wandered. I woke up at noon, got up at 4 and had a shower at 6. - Did you go out? - I went to the pharmacy. - What else? You read? - A bit. You ate? - I don't know if I'll go. I feel like going home. - Come with us! - Are you sure? - Sure. Stay with us. Absolutely, stay. What is it, Christelle? Am I a nuisance? Do you feel uneasy? I do too. I wish I wasn't here. I don't know why I'm here. - To go to this party. - With you? - Yes, with me. - We'll go together and then what? - We'll go home together? - Yes. - Maybe I won't feel like it. - I know. Don't say "I know". Say "I know, but I'll keep bothering you anyway." - Anybody have cigarettes? - I have some. - One full pack? - A half. - We have to buy more. - People there will give us more. - Give me one. - I don't have a light. - You want a light? - Please. - Fuck! - Are you okay? Christelle? Fuck, I'm sorry! I'm getting off. Excuse me. - Didn't you hear? I said sorry. - I'm getting off. We don't have the address. 83 Rocher Street. - The code is 359AB. - Wait. Go after her! - This is ridiculous. - Go! - What about you? - Go! Well... - Goodbye. Too bad. - Goodbye. - Waiting for the bus? - Yes. - Isn't it too late? - There is a direct night bus. Did you find Christelle? She left. Yes, I found her. - What are you going to do? - Go home. Go home and go to sleep. - And you? - Me? - You can't stay here. - No. - You'll go home too? - Yes. - Can I wait with you? - If you want to. Do you smoke a lot? How many? Two packs, two and a half. Three if I don't sleep. You'll die from it. Or maybe not. You don't have to die. You won't die from lip cancer. You just won't have lips any more. You will have stitchings instead. Like this. So you're interested in cancers? Or tongue cancer. You will have no tongue. Or larynx cancer. You will have no liver. You will talk via a vibraphone, thanks to your stomach. My father had one. He went through reeducation. They gave him a Coke so he could burp. Now he speaks with his stomach. - Really? - Yes. - Where will you get off? - Télégraphe. - You live there? - Yes. - Room? - Studio. - Alone? - Yes. Expensive? - Subleased. - How much? - 2,600. - Don't you live with your boyfriend? - Don't you have a boyfriend? - I do. I know. - How do you know? - I know him. - How. - I just know him. What's his name? Antoine. Antoine Barsier. Right? - How do you know him? - I met him. I met him once. He's a really nice guy. Why do you say that? I don't know. He's nice. Really nice. How old is he? - 27. - You? - 26. - You? 29. - You're going to his place now. - No, I'm going home. Télégraphe, told you. - Don't you want to sleep at my place? - Are you crazy? - What? - We don't know each other. Yes, all the better. Don't you want to? - No. - I'm asking because... I'd really like you to come. - And Christelle? - I don't mean sex. Really? So what? - Chat. - Aren't we chatting now? It's different at my place. Let's take a cab, you have no other plans. Go home and sleep. - Do you have scruples? - No. - Are you afraid? - No. Come then. I don't want to. Well. I get it, I'm a pain. Forget what I said. - Do you think it was a good party? - No. - Christelle gave us the address. - You want to go there? - What for? - I don't know, dance. - Dance? You and me? - Dance, generally speaking. Generally? I'm ridiculous. I don't know what to say. - Next time a car passes, I kiss you. - I don't want to. I won't kiss you. We don't know each other. There's no reason for a kiss. - I'll make a call. - To your boyfriend? Nevermind... - I'll only let you out for a kiss. - On the lips? Of course on the lips. How old are you? - Leave me alone now. - Don't you want my number? - I don't have a pen. - 42-22-93-99. - 42-22-93-99 - The way to remember it: 222-93-99. 222-93-99. The bus is here, come on. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm here. - I can see that. Can we talk? No? We can't talk? Can we talk it over? - Can't you give me an explanation? - No, I told you already. Yes, but you knew it was me, and you opened the door anyway. You could have not opened. I would have rang the bell once more and left. - You would have come again. - No. We can't stay here, let's go downstairs. Okay? Let's have a coffee. I'll take the stairs. I'll wait for you downstairs. Let's go over there. Aren't you answering? Are you coming? Don't you sit down? - What will you have? - Coffee and bread. And you? Two coffees, a slice of bread and a croissant, please. Enough, sit down. What is it? You won't talk to me now? I don't know, don't just stand there. Sit down. Sit down. Have a seat! Sit down, please. Okay... What have you been doing lately? Do you still have your flat? You found a job? You looked for one? I don't understand what you want. Drink your coffee, at least. Well, I will go. I will go to work. What about your life? What are you thinking about? What's in your head? Stop being crazy, please. Do you hear what I'm saying? It's true, I didn't say it clearly. We have never been able to talk. There is no discussion to have, no explanation to give. You understand? I don't blame you for anything. It's just me, I was wrong. When we met, I liked you. I was happy with you, I was seduced by you. I would think of you when we were not together. You were not just a girl I wanted to have sex with. I really thought it would be a beautiful story, but I was wrong. I prefer to be alone. I'm better alone. I'm looking at you now, it's shocking. I feel far away from you. It's a handicap to feel that far from people. When I talk to people, it sounds fake. The more moved I am, the faker. Come on... Have a seat. Sit here. I'm going then. Goodbye. I've been thinking a lot, you know. I've looked at the problem from every angle. Now I know, I really know. I love you. - Marry me. - What? - I want to marry you. - You and me? - Yes. - I don't understand. I don't understand either. I don't understand why we are not together. I love you so much you will have to love me too. You just have to be patient. It will take time. There were times for me too, when I loved you less. I waited and it came back. You're going too fast! You're thinking: "If it's over today, it's over forever." It's false. You just need to become aware of that. You can't trust a temporary thought. It would be like closing your eyes and saying you've gone blind! Just go on, and you will love me. I know it! I swear, I know it! - Give me a chance. - Wait. - I'm waiting. - You came here to say this? - Yes. - You want to marry me? That's absurd. I can wait at the café if you have work to do. I'm free. I can't leave the hospital. It doesn't matter, we will find a place. - Okay. - Not too long. No, not too long. - How many guys have you slept with? - Why do you ask? - I don't know. - 10? 20? I don't know. No more than that. I don't want to count. - I don't care about that number. - How many were there before me? Let's say 20. - How many love stories? Real ones. - 2. How many times did you want to marry? This is the first time. How old are you? 26? You are 26. You slept with 20 guys. - You loved two and wanted to marry one. - So what? - How old were you your first time? - I don't care. - Let's say 17. - 16. So it's two guys a year. You love 1/10 and want to marry 1/20. - So what? - In 5 years, you will have loved 3. Wanted to marry 1.5. Don't you believe in love? Is that it? One day, you will bump into me in the street. What will you recognize? My eyes, my mouth, my voice... Nothing of what you're talking about today. Time will pass. It will pass, and you can't do anything about that. Even if you try to hold it back. Even if you keep thinking about it for a year. You will pass with time. You can remain immobile and pass. You won't move your pinky, but you will pass. It will pass without you. No. It doesn't have to. Time doesn't have to pass. You know, I know a girl called Sylvie Montaigu. She was a classmate of mine. She was crazy in love with a guy who dumped her. She stopped eating, started vomiting, took laxatives and weighed 31 kg. She couldn't lose any more weightr, she was hospitalized and fed through a dip. When she got out of the hospital, she took trichlorethylene and died. - The guy didn't come to her funeral. - You bet he didn't. - You're cynical. - Not at all. You think she died of illness? Or because she loved a guy who didn't love her. - Trying to scare me? - Answer me. I don't know, both. She loved him pathologically. - Do you know what I think? - No. You look exhausted. You have bags under your eyes. I don't think I could love somebody who doesn't love me. I think feelings... True feelings are always reciprocal. They have to be. - No? - No. - It's impossible. - Look at me as proof. Say you don't love me. Say it. Say "I don't love you". "I don't love you!" I don't love you. There's no chance you'll love me someday? There's no chance I'll love you someday. It's definitive. Say that too. - It's definitive. - I disgust you. "Because you disgust me." Because you disgust me. - Now I believe you. - Okay, good for you. I'm an idiot. I'm such an idiot! I'm totally delusional. In that case, maybe I don't love you either. Certainly not. - It's not love I have for you. - No, it's pride. A crazy pride. You love vertigo. You love it when I say no. You want to marry me just because I left you. - I'm leaving. - I won't stop you. I think you are a cold guy. So cold! You're scary, Nathalie. So scary nobody will ever want to marry you. - You really needed to say this? - Yes. That's so fucking mean. Hello? - Hello, is this Fabrice? - Yes. Hi, this is Nathalie Rivière, do you remember me? Yes, hello. I don't know, I just wanted to call you. You gave me your number, you remember? Well... Yes... Yes. I don't know... Do you want to see me? You decide. - Okay. - Shall we have a rendez-vous? If you want to. - When? Now? - Now? I don't know. You decide. It's not possible now? It is. - Where? - I don't know. Can you come to Châtelet? - Okay. - At the café on the left when you exit. Okay. - Hello? - Yes? Can't I come to your place instead? - You know where it is? - No. 83, 13th arrondissement, Censier subway. Third floor, on the left. - The code is FA940. - FA... - Force Air 940. - Force Air 940. Thank you. Hi! - Were you leaving? Am I disturbing you? - No. - Are you alone? - Yes. Are you sure I'm not disturbing you? Maybe you had plans. No, I have nothing to do. I've brought some gin. Come in. Do you live alone? - I have a flatmate. - But he is out now? - Yes. - What is he doing? Working? Is this your room? No, it's the other one. But we'll stay in here. Let's drink. I'll go get glasses. - Shall we sit down? - Yes! Let's sit here. I'm a bit nervous, sorry. I don't know what to say. - Neither do I. - What? - I didn't hear. - Neither do I. I said: "Neither do I." "Morning is the worst that can happen." You know who wrote that? - No. - Make an effort. I don't know. At least say when it was written. What time? Nowadays? The very middle of the 19th century. 1850. Not bad, right? - Charles Dickens. - Do you write? - No. - You would like to write? - No. - So you like reading. - No, that's over. - You mean it... - I mean, it was possible. Why? If you don't understand, let's not talk about it. I'm an idiot. I'm totally uneducated. But I get it when it's explained. I am not able to explain. I say things I cannot explain. I don't accept responsibilities. I don't accept anything. I'll put a record on. - Do you know this? - No. - It's Lou Reed, don't you know? - I don't know this song. - Do you understand what he says? - No. It's from the antepenultimate album. This is no time for celebration. This is no time for shaking hands. This is no time to go in circles. This is no time for endless thought. This is no time for my country to be right or wrong to count its wounds. This is no time for private gain. This is no time to swallow anger. This is no time to bear and shut up. This is no time to ignore hate. This is no time to uselessly endure, because the time is fading away. It's too late. This is no time for small vendettas. This is no time to clear the plates. This is no time to be sorry and let the past be our responsibility. This is a time to gather force, take aim and attack. This is no time for saluting flags. - This is a revolutionary song. - Yes, I got it. - So how will we be able to talk? - I don't know. - Can you find a talking point? - Nothing. - Maybe I have drunk too much. - Me too! Let's go to your room. Let's undress. Yes. Let's go to bed. Yes. Then we will see what happens next. Yes. You should say something. You should try to say something so I can interrupt you and kiss you. - But we don't know each other. - I thought that was better for you. - I said that. I was pretending. - I will leave now. No. I'm going over there. Shall we close the shutters? There are no clean sheets. Why am I doing this? I really don't know why I am doing this. Excuse me, I'm totally drunk. Once, a guy I had slept with told me my ass was awful. - Do you think my ass is awful? - No. - I think so. - I don't. That guy said I was horrible in bed. As if it was easy. He said I was not a good lay. I'm talking too much, sorry. That is not the right way? You probably want me to leave. I'm cold, I'm freezing. Can I come closer? Come. I was with a girl once, she told me I was focused and laborious. Laborious! A guy told me I was nicely enthusiastic. - But that I went to bed too fast. - I've been told this too. And that I was hurtful. Now I'm afraid to hurt. I slept with a guy who had three nipples. - I don't believe you. - I swear it's true. - Why are you laughing? - It's nervous. I'm looking at you and you have a funny face. - A funny face? - Yeah. Funny, how? Your face is weird. Weird, how? Do I seem weird? It's not your looks, it's your face. The shape of your head. I don't know. It's your nose, your mouth, your eyes. Your forehead, the shape of your head. Your skull. I don't see what's funny. I don't know. We don't know each other. We're different. We don't look alike. - What is it? - Nothing. I'm ugly. I will leave, maybe. Yes. I'll let you get dressed. You're leaving? - You want me to stay? - No. Will you call me? - Very soon. - We'll see. Yes. Bye. Bye. I know you are not happy with me. It doesn't matter. It will pass. Really? Why? How? Because I love you. - Do you think that is enough? - Yes, it is enough. It's enough because I love you in a way nobody else can love you. The little self-esteem you have comes from me. That's why you stay with me. If you were to leave me, you would lose that. Because I know you. I'm the only one in the world to know you. If you break up with me, you will be all alone. Nobody wants that. Unless you are crazy. - You'd be all alone too. - I am already. This is so fucking joyful. This is so fucking joyful! This is life, girl. I want us to have a baby. We can't make such a decision in this situation. A child must come from... From love, I don't know. You don't decide important things. They just happen. They are brought by our lives. When I was pregnant, we had an opportunity. You didn't want it, now it's too late. I didn't know what you wanted. You didn't tell me anything. - I wanted it to be clear. - Clear? How could I make it be clear? It's never clear. - I want you to find something... - Something what? I don't know. To erase it. It's not... It's not fair. Hey! I think we should break up. What are we going to do? How do we proceed? Fuck! "How do we proceed?" - In order. - You're joking. It's not a joke. I can't believe this is not a joke. That's all. You would have to stand up, walk, gather your belongings and leave. - I will give you back your keys too. - Yes. What? Of us. What will remain? I mean, will anything survive? Sorry, it's bullshit. I'm an idiot. It's weird, I... I feel like it's hanging by a thread. Maybe I... - Maybe I should just hit you. - No. See, you're afraid? Afraid it would work. - No, it's not that. - What is it? It'd be too sad. - Maybe I should hit myself. - No. Please. No. See, you are moved. No. - What can move you? - Nothing. I have... Left? Yes. Do you remember the first time we went to Orange? Your parents had me sleep in the living room and you in your room. I'd sneak out to meet you in the middle of the night! Yes... I'd walk backwards in front of you so you'd not look at my ass. What? You're staying? - No. - You're here. You are staying. Can you bring my belongings somewhere? Or leave them at the concierge. No. Take your belongings now. - What do we do about the car? - You want it? - That would be convenient. - Take it. - Where is it? - Downstairs. The keys are in my jacket. In the inside pocket. Fuck... I can't get up. I can't move. Thank you. Finally! You're dumping me. Yes. - Nathalie! - Yes? Are you sure you want to leave? - Yes, sure. - Be careful. Leave, and it will be over. Don't try to see me again. Don't try to contact me. No matter the reason. Okay? Okay? Nathalie. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. I mean, are you normal? Do you realize what you're doing? Yes! Good. I just wanted to be sure you know what you're doing. That you could see me. Me. Now. Yes. So it's good. Here we are. There's something he didn't understand. There's something I didn't understand. There's something I understood but he... There's something he understood but I didn't. There's something he didn't understand. Something must be wrong with him. Something must be wrong with me. Something must be wrong with him. With me... With him... She should have told me. Mom? Mom! Mom! - What's going on? - Hello. I don't have the new code. - I'm Mrs Rivière's daughter. 4th, left. - I don't recognize you. The previous code was 46292. Okay. It's 22110. Thank you. - Was it good? - Yeah... Guys often ask afterward, if it was good. It's a bit dumb, but not that bad. They feel responsible. - What's your responsibility toward me? - None. Yeah, that's right. If you had responsibilities, what would they be? Why are you asking? What did you want to get out of this? Have sex with you. What was the meaning? Nothing special, just what happened. Before it happened, what was the idea? What were you expecting? To have sex with you. What else? You? What were you expecting? To learn something. About you. About my life, thanks to you. To be transformed, to be changed. What love is, for instance. Roll up your sleeve. - Like this? - Yes. Now give me your hand. And close your eyes. Close. Don't cheat. I will go up your arm with my finger, and you tell me to stop when you think I'm just at the center of your elbow, here. Go ahead. It's here. That's weird. Yes. It always works. Don't stay here, go sleep over there. Does it ever occur to you that other people can like me? Other persons can think I'm desirable. It happens, you know. People can think I'm sexy. Seduce me then. - Does Nathalie seduce you? - Yes. - She came here when I wasn't here? - Yes. - Several times? - Once. Come to bed. Did you have sex? No. How can I believe you? You'd fuck a goat. Not a goat, Christelle. Not a goat. She is the only friend I have. If you cheat on me with her, if you fuck her... Fuck me. Like this? I can't. You're trying to humiliate me. - You want to see me down. - That's how you love me. I'm pregnant with you. You can't be, Christelle, we haven't had sex in weeks. I'm sure I am. - You took a test? - Yes. What was the result of the test? I am pregnant. - So there is no doubt. - No, no doubt. Look. - I could think it's not mine. - You know it is. I know it is, but I can refuse to acknowledge my paternity. You wouldn't do that. - Are you okay? - Did you hear us? Yes, the place is not soundproofed. - Are you okay? - I'm great. And you? Sit down. No. - How long have we known each other? - Nothing happened. We just talked. - That's what he said. - And that's what I say. It's true. It's the truth. My hands are shaking, I have a fever, I'm exhausted. It's because you're pregnant. Sit down. I broke up with Antoine. I broke up with Eric too. Then you can break up with me too. You must be happy. You are alone. All alone, that's what you wanted. If you wanted to end our friendship, congratulations, you ended it. It wasn't worth a thing to you. You can't stand being loved. You can't stop people loving you. People who want to marry you or have a child with you. - But you hold on to people who want to leave you. - I'm not responding. You are stupid. You are hunched up. You are totally empty. - You're empty and emptying. - I'm leaving. All the better. I will sleep here. I can't stand it. My life is going to change. I'm going to have a baby. Bye then. Bye. Are you alright? Are you alright? I had a car accident. - I have no place to go. Can I sleep here? - No. I'll find something tomorrow and stop bothering you. I swear. I will go to... people, or a hotel, or my mother... Stop. - Please... - No. Don't be a jerk. - One has to be a jerk with you. You have no limit. - This is the last time. You couldn't sleep here even if I wanted to. I will take you to a cab. Where to? I'm not alone. I... What is... her name? Hélène. How long have you known her? I'd like to know why I'm here and she's in your bed. Why you sleep quietly so as not to wake her up and I don't know... where to sleep. What does she have that I don't have? What is it? Her legs? Her ass? Her tits? What she says? The way she has sex? - No. - So what is it? It's... Just somebody else. Another girl. - Anybody but me. - Please don't cry. - I'm not crying. Do you love her? How do you feel? Do you think of her even when she is near you. And when she's not, you keep thinking about her. You don't think about me. How is it? New? Not only the girl is new but the feelings too, right? Answer me. You're talking alone. It's a monologue. I don't understand what you're saying. And she loves you too. I think so. Aren't you afraid... you love her less than she loves you? Or the opposite. - Aren't you afraid you may hurt each other? - Of course I am. But you can bear it. I can't believe you. If you really loved her, it'd have changed you. But you haven't changed. Can't people see I love you? Can't people see you don't love me? Can I come in just for a second? If I see her, I will understand, and I will leave. Just one second, and I'll leave. - Is she asleep or pretending? - She's asleep. Go away now. - You know what, I spit on you. - I spit on myself too. You're going to fuck? - I'm sorry! - Stop it. Leave me alone now. Even if you like her, even if she's good with you, - she can't love you more than I do. - Think so? - I could have loved you my whole life and married you. - You wanted to force me. - It was me, but it could have been anyone. - False! You can choose anybody and force him to understand you, love you, marry you. - Anything but love you. - It's not true. - You don't want to be loved. You are all alone, Nathalie. You're a dog trying to jerk off. You hold on to my leg but don't care who it belongs to. It's disgusting. Take my hand. Put it on you. And? Can you feel it's me? No. Is that what you wanted to hear? You don't believe what you're saying. You speak as if we never knew each other. Go away, I'm asking you. - Hello? - Antoine? - Hello? - Yes? It's me, Nathalie. - You called the wrong number. - I'm sorry. - Hello? - Hello? - Yes? - Antoine? - No, you made an error. - This is not... 41-00-03-33? - It is. - It was his number... - I'm the new tenant. - I recognize your voice... - You're mistaken. I'm sorry. - Do you have his new number? - No. It doesn't matter. Thank you. Hello? Hello? Antoine, it's me. Speak up, I know it's you. It's dumb. Listen, I don't know who you are. If you keep calling, I'll have to unplug my phone. Sorry. Okay, I'm hanging up now. I really knew him. I didn't think I could be mistaken. Are you there? Yes... Can I speak to you anyway? I won't hang up the phone. You hang up if you feel like it. Hello? Did you drop the handset? I was calling because I can't go on without him. And I wish I could see him again. Antoine, do you take care of yourself? Sorry, you're not him! Does it bother you that I talk to you? - Is it unpleasant? - No. You enjoy it? Where are you? Where are you? You want to meet me? Yes. Really? You don't know... - You don't know what you're saying! - Why? I'm not worth meeting. Why? I'm tough. Direct, cold and cruel. And physically? Normal. But it does not compensate. You can't know this. I can. I know that at the end of the end, I'm a real pain. A poison. An ordeal. You still want to meet me? Yes. Are you a catholic? No. - I'm coming, where are you? - Antoine! - Don't get started again! - Okay. Tell me where you are. Downstairs. Just downstairs, in the phone booth. I'm coming.
