[instrumental "joy to the world" plays] ♪♪♪ ♪ [rings doorbell] is this the darlington house? The one and only. Mrs. Darlington? Mr. Darlington's assistant. Well, one of the darlingtons. And I picked out that beauty. Jessica lew. Thank you. It'll just be a minute. [instrumental "we wish you a merry christmas"] ♪♪♪ ♪ you've outdone yourself this year, jess. Thanks, mrs. Brooks. I figure it's the last christmas doing this so I should go out with the biggest tree possible. And you succeeded. You're going to be missed around here. Oh, I'm still going to be part of the darlington corporation family, just one of the many, many attorneys. You'll never be just anything. Hey, boss. Not for much longer. Uh, you are the chairman so you are still gonna be my boss. Good point. And besides, I have to finish off the last details of the christmas party- which you can do blindfolded. And then get you off to europe. Then I can spend the rest of December relaxing until I start my new gig. I like that plan for you. Thanks. I kinda like it myself. The last time I spent more than a weekend doing nothing was... Never mind. I can't remember. Actually, jess, there's one last favour I need to ask of you. Jessica, this is lena thomas, our family law attorney. Lena, this is jessica lew, my soon to be ex-assistant extraordinaire. Nice to finally meet you. Same. How many times have we spoken on the phone? Quite a few. And charles tells me that congratulations are in order. You passed the bar. Oh, thank you. I'm so glad to finally be done with school. Especially while working for a tyrant at the same time. Yes, there is that. So, I guess because you're here, that means the one more favour- is about my niece's and nephew, yes. They're coming back to the states from australia. Oh, wow. I've never actually met them before. I've only handled their paperwork. Well, they've been gone a while. Three years. How long will they be here for? Permanently. Charles and his brother, max, will be assuming full guardianship of their late brother's children when they return in three days. I'm sorry, you and max? Will be their new guardians, yes. Max? Their late mother's aunt mathilda became their guardian after the accident. Charles: Wonderful woman. She's in sydney where the kids have lived for three years. We all originally agreed that it would be better for them to stay where they were, not disrupt them any further by bringing them to the states. So what changed? Mathilda's had some health challenges and she can't take care of them anymore. And the rest of nicole's family in australia aren't able to assume the responsibility. Which means... Max and I will take care of them. Hmm. Max. ♪ ten seconds off my best time. I'll alert the media. But first, aprés skis. This is why we're friends. [message alert] ah, that must be the lovely vanessa. She misses me. It's been two days. It's called marriage. You know, when two people like each other a whole lot and miss each other when they're apart, even for two days? I've heard of such things [laughs] someday, max. Someday. Yeah, yeah. Emma's 13, j. Henry 10, and abby's eight. This is a recent photo. I'm gonna meet them in los angeles and then fly back with them here to connecticut on Friday. Oh, well you'll be in europe when they arrive and I will be up to the christmas party. Which is why I need your help. Ok. I've made all the arrangements for them. Max is watching them over christmas? Oh, no. They'll be going to paden academy in vermont. Boarding school? One of the best in the country. Max, jarrett and I all went there. It's fantastic. But I don't understand. Where will they be during christmas? Paden academy. It's ok. My brothers and I, we stayed there several times while our parents were on various holidays. I know it's not ideal timing. I would love to have the children at the house over christmas, but you know how important this trip to europe is. Paden really does have an incredible staff. The children can settle in, be ready for the new year. So what is it you need from me? It's simple. Take them to paden. That's it? That's it. I would do it but as soon as they arrive I have to leave town for my parents' anniversary party. And mrs. Brooks can watch them for a bit but I don't want to overwork her, especially with her arthritis. No, of course. And max, well... Well, I don't know where max is. Skiing in vermont. Right. Does he know about all of this yet? I haven't been able to reach him. Jessica, I don't suppose you could- yes, I will let him know. Thank you. So everything is set for whistler over christmas. Reservation starts Monday. Nice. Hal? Yeah. I'm... Out for whistler. Come on! We've been planning this all year. See? This is why you two are still single. I want to be with my wife on our first christmas together. Bring her. The cabin's huge. We're heading to her family's place. Bring them. It's a huge cabin. Ok, this isn't arbor day, it's christmas. Some of us like to spend christmas with our families. You should try it sometime. [phone buzzing] I gotta take this. I'll be right back. They're going to paden? Jessica: Your brother swears it's fantastic. Yeah, charles would. He was practically born in a coat and tie. I take it you don't share his enthusiasm for paden? It was not my scene. They expected you to study, didn't they? Rude, right? And there was this little incident with the headmaster's private pool and some pink dye. Oh, max. If I had a nickel for every "oh, max" I've heard in my life. You'd have as much money as you already have. Close. So I just wanted to make sure that you knew the situation before your nieces and nephew got here. Which is when, again? Friday. And you're gonna take them there? I am. And then the amazing jessica is free. At least until I start my new job. Well, it won't be the same without you. Well, I've only been charles's ea for two and a half years. It feels longer. Aren't you charming? No, I... That was supposed to be a compliment. Supposed to be. Bye, max. Bye, jessica. Ok, guys, so... Slight change of plans. What do you think? It looks great. I think kids would actually like this. Kids? What kids? The darlington nieces and nephew. Oh, right. And when are you chauffeuring said nieces and nephew to the boarding school? To be clear there will be an actual chauffeur. Of course there will, darling. They're arriving on Friday and then they're gonna be staying the weekend to adjust after the long flight and then I will be going with them to the boarding school on Monday. Oh. If they can stay without their uncles for the weekend why can't they stay longer? Christmas is only a little over two weeks away. Mrs. Brooks can watch them short term but I think anything longer than a couple of days is asking a lot. Hmm. Too bad there's no one else. I mean, it's christmas. No one should be alone on christmas. Hey, well done! Thank you. Ok. What else? Alfonso will meet you at the lisbon airport and take you directly to the darlington offices there. And where are you in the preparations for the christmas party? The plaza grand ballroom is booked and zumel's will be catering again. Excellent. Everything needs to be perfect. Because...? Because mr. Lee from liuxing motors has agreed to be my guest at the party. Did you secure the deal? Not yet, it's between us and york ventures which is why I need to impress him. Well, fortunately, the darlington corporation christmas party is always impressive. Yes, it is. Getting into the taiwan auto market would be a major coup for our corporation. I'm sure it's gonna happen. And speaking of cars, yours to the airport is now downstairs. I'll be right there. Oh, hey. Do you have everything you need for getting the children to paden? I do. What's on your mind? Max? Max. Motion passed. My name is max. What're you doing here? Well, dear brother, this is the darlington company and rumour has it I am the president of said company so I thought I'd make my quarterly appearance. Did we replace the access cards? Two months ago. Ah. I was just on my way to the airport. Europe, right? It's in the calendar. I do check. I also told you. And that. Hi, jess. Paden academy? What about it? Don't I get a say in what happens to my nieces and nephew? What could you possibly say? It's one of the best schools in the country. Yes, but if we're both going to be their guardians then we both need to be involved in these decisions. Fair enough. And do they have to go right away? There's no one else to watch them. I'll be gone and you're, well... Go on. It's the same reason we didn't take full guardianship in the first place. I work 24/7. And you don't exactly have a parenting lifestyle. There'll be no one else here while I'm in europe. Thanks. I can help watch the kids through christmas. The christmas party is on automatic pilot and you're in europe until the 20th and I basically have the next couple of weeks off. It's your vacation. Which means I have time. Yeah, but... Why? It's christmas. Let's just say that I know what it's like to be a kid alone at christmas. I can handle all three of them. And mrs. Brooks is there if I have any questions. And I'll stay, too. What? What's happening here? You don't have to. I know. I'll go to whistler after christmas, you'll be back from europe by then. I've already made the plans. Plans can change. But the plan to get you to the airport needs to start now. Hold on. Are you sure you can handle this? I am. I am, too. Ok, I trust you completely and you're right, it would be better for the children to be at the house over christmas. Especially after what they've been through. I'm going to call you as soon as I land in lisbon, we'll go over the details. Max please don't make me regret this. Have a nice trip. Don't forget the chocolate! Ground rules. For me watching my family? Well, for us watching your family. Together. Go for it. I'm in charge. Yeah, that seems self-evident. And I have a vision. Ooh, do tell. Well, it's still forming but from what I understand the kids have been in australia for three years? Uh, more like four, actually. Jarrett and nicole moved to sydney six months before the accident. Nicole is from sydney originally. So that means they've had three warm christmases. Yep. Summer santa. So why don't we give them a real old-fashioned new England christmas? I mean, like, cookies and hot chocolate. My friend zoe, she has a christmas fair fundraiser that I could take them to. I got ya. Ok. Well, I'll come up with a list of things that we can do and places we can go- and sometimes maybe we'll just wing it. Uh, no. We do not wing it with children. My parents did with me. I doubt that. I'm sure it was more that you were too much of a handful to control. Yeah, probably. So, I'm thinking for this to work I need to stay at the darlington house when the kids are there. That makes sense to me, there's plenty of rooms, enough for the kids to have their own room, too. Ok, so I'm gonna call mrs. Brooks, update her on the plan. The kids are coming on Friday afternoon so I'll come over on Friday morning and then we can just go pick them up together? Yes, boss. Don't you forget it. Never. ♪ hmm, busy... Yeah. So you gave up your first vacation in years, right before your new job, I might add, to watch three children you don't know over christmas? I did. Tell your mom thanks for the christmas dinner invite, though. Yeah. She loves you. She'll get it once I explain. As your best friend, I might be the only person who won't immediately ask you why you're doing this. You've been there. Yeah. It doesn't make it any less crazy that I'm doing it, though. Oh, no, definitely crazy. Also kind, generous, and very, very you. What're you getting? Christmas roll fudge. Oh, I've never had that before. It's delicious. It's the last piece. We'll split it. No, it's ok. I'll just stick to the chocolate fudge. Uh, there's one more piece in the back. I can get it for you if you'd like. Perfect, thank you. No problem, zoe. Kate's flirting with you again. Is not. Is, as she always does whenever you're here. You should ask her to come to the christmas fair. I can't. I get too nervous. You've seen me. True. Ok, well give her a flyer. You do it. You are a surgeon. How are you not able to ask someone out? Because unlike surgery, people are conscious and can reject you. Do not give me that look miss I'm always too busy to date. How long ago was jason? A long time. This is the last piece, but I can make more tomorrow. Feel free to come by. Thank you so much. And uh, here. This is happening next week, all proceeds are going towards the children's wing at st. Francis hospital which is where zoe works. As a surgeon. Cool. Maybe I can bring my nephew. Uh, sure. That sounds perfect. [exhales] stop pacing. Lena will bring them. What are those? Christmas presents for the children. From you and charles. You really do think of everything, don't you? And here they are. Hey, hey! Hey! Hey, kids! Hello, uncle max. Hi, uncle max. Who's she? This is miss jessica lew. She is your uncle charles's executive assistant. Jess, I'd like you to meet my eldest niece, emma, my nephew j. Henry, and my youngest niece, abby. Hello. Hi. It's nice to finally meet you. Finally? I've been hearing a lot about you. Are you the one ms. Lena says is gonna be watching us over christmas? I am. Actually, we- we both are. So when- when- when was the last time that you guys were back here? Three years, seven months, ten days. J. Henry likes math. That's right, I remember. That's- that's cool. I like- I like math, too. Sort of. Oh, but not as much as I like presents! That's for you... What are these? These are some welcome gifts. Your uncles realize it's been a while since you've experienced christmas in new England so... We got you some uh... Christmas sweaters. Thank you. We did pack sweaters. I love mine! Shall we head to the house? Great idea. Do you want me to grab that? Ok. ♪ and this is probably a lot colder than you're used to but here it is! That's a really big tree. Max: It is, isn't it? Hello, children. Children: Mrs. Brooks! I don't know if you remember me. I'm mrs. Brooks and I've worked for the darlington family for many years. But you were very young when you were last here. Are you the nice lady who makes the chocolate pies? French silk is one of my specialties. Of course I remember you! Ok, let's show you to your rooms. Ok, I'll grab your coats. -Thank you. -Thank you. I'll race you up the stairs. They're so quiet. Well, part of it's the flight. Is that the only reason? The last three years have been a challenge for them. And having to leave their great aunt mathilda and come here again after so long is yet another change. Well, I'll make sure they video call her as often as they'd like to help with the transition. Thank you. Ok, j. Henry, this will be your room. It was actually your dad's when he was growing up. Um, ok ladies, I'll show you to your room next. You've got my cell. Feel free to call me if you have any more questions. I will. Thank you. This is a big thing you're doing, jessica, watching them like this. Is it? It feels so natural. I mean, what kid wouldn't want to stay here versus going to boarding school? I think you're quite right. Good luck. Safe travels. Thank you. [exhales] [sighs] long day. Yes, but it's good to have children in the house again. Yep, four of them. [laughs] well, max always was a free spirit, but his heart's as big as kansas and his energy is, well, boundless, always was. What was he like as a kid? Oh, you'll find out as soon as j. Henry warms up. Full of life and love. Max was a happy child. He always thought jarrett was the glue between the three brothers but really I think it was max. He took it very hard when we lost jarrett. I think that's maybe when... When what? Oh, when he and charles became more distant and max spent less and less time at home. But now he's back and I think he's taking this very seriously. Assuming guardianship. I hope so. Ah, give him a chance, my dear. He may surprise you. Well, I'm gonna go check on the kids. You have a good night, mrs. Brooks. You too, jessica. Max: Emma? Abby? I can't find the girls anywhere. How did you lose the kids already? I don't know, but I checked emma's room and abby's and- emma: Pass the sheet. [children chatting] what's this? We all wanted to stay together. And I wanted to stay in dad's old room, too. That's- that's ok. But if you guys change your minds we have plenty of rooms for each of you. You just let me or jess know. Thank you. Also, we wanna make sure that you have the best christmas possible so why don't you make a list of christmas activities that you wanna do over the next couple of weeks? But it doesn't have to be an actual list. Though the act of making a list can help generate ideas. Right, but if something happens to come to mind spur of the moment you just tell us- and I will write it down. She will write it down. [yawns] I think that's our cue. Goodnight, guys. Goodnight uncle max, goodnight jessica. See you at breakfast. 8:00 am. Or whenever you wake up. J. Henry: It could be fun, doing christmas-y stuff. Emma: It could be. But remember, we're leaving here after christmas. J. Henry: I know. Emma: So don't get too comfortable. I think we have a lot of work ahead of us. I think you're right. Yeah. -Goodnight. -'night. ♪ did you guys sleep ok? Mmmhmm. Emma: The bed was so comfortable. Oh, good. Good, good, good. Sorry, sorry. I overslept. Good morning, family. Jessica. -How is everybody? -Fine. So now that we are all here, did you come up with any christmas ideas for things that we can do? Any ideas? There's no wrong answers. Um, we usually decorate the christmas tree together. Their tree's already decorated. Oh, right. Doesn't mean we can't decorate another tree. You want to chop down one of these trees? Nope. No trees will be chopped. Where are you going with this? We are gonna decorate them right where they are, and we're gonna make ornaments that are ok for the animals to eat if they want. And let's face it, they probably want. We'll make the ornaments? Yep, and then you can see the trees every time you look out the back window. That's cool. It is cool. Thanks. It's something I used to do with my mom when I was growing up. We had this pine tree in the back yard and we would decorate that sometimes instead of buying one. I think that's the first bit of personal information I've ever heard from you. Is it? Yeah. Huh. Ok, who's ready to get started? [laughs] ok. Now we get to make the ornaments and I have some bags of bird seed in my car. -Come on, let's go! -Race you! You just happen to have bird seed in your car? And all weather fairy lights. It's called "not winging it". -Mmm. -Mmmhmm. ♪ christmas time is here again ♪ ♪ with all of winter chill ♪ ♪ all the people gather round as christmas day draws near ♪ ♪ snow falling, never had so much fun ♪ ♪ ... Christmas day ♪ ♪ never seen it turn this way ♪ [cheering and clapping] ♪ ding, dong, ding ♪ how's your dough coming, emma? Fine. I'm mainly helping abby. Don't forget to have fun yourself. This is your christmas, too. I know, I'm just used to helping them. Hmm. I can see that. But you know, that's what your uncle max and I are here for. For now. Then we go to the boarding school and it'll be just us again. Yeah. That's ok. I can handle it. What now? Now we wait for them to dry and then tonight we can hang them on the tree. So what're we gonna do until then? What would you like to do? Oh, oh, oh. I have an idea. Are you winging it right now? As a matter of fact I am. What's the most christmas-y of christmas activities? Could you tell us? A carriage ride! Come on! Put the blanket down there. You like horses? Yeah. I used to love reading books about horses when I was little. Mmm. Do you ride? A little. My aunt mathilda knew I loved horses and let me take lessons on the weekends. Mmm. I'm sure your uncles could arrange more lessons for you over your spring break. There's plenty of equestrian centres here. -Mmmhmm. -Ok, shall we? ♪ -I could get used to the snow. -This is so beautiful. -This is so much fun. -I love this. Can I drive... Please. I think they like it. -This is cool, hey? -Mmmhmm. Good call. Wha- could you say that a little louder? Maybe record it? Perhaps post it on social media? Well, at least you're not gloating. This is fun. I haven't done this since my last winter in college, I think. I never have. I think it's safe to say you and I had some very different childhoods. Apparently. Oh... Sorry. -C'mon guys, let's go. -Thanks! -Wasn't that great? -We so need to do this again. Thank you, that was fun. Max: You're welcome. -That was fun. -Thanks. Who's that? Uh, that was my buddy. He's upset that I'm delaying my christmas trip to whistler, especially after our friend, hal, already bowed out. Why'd hal bow out? He wanted to spend time with his wife and her family. Hmm, imagine that. I know, right? What about your family? How come you're not spending christmas with them? I don't have any. None? My parents got a divorce when I was really young and it was just me and my mom growing up. Where is she now? She passed away when I was a junior in high school. I'm sorry. So you're like us? I guess so. And you too, uncle max. I guess I never thought of it that way. How about we head up to the house and finish decorating those trees? Sure!

We did a lot on their first day. We made tree ornaments, went on a carriage ride. Oh, sounds fun. That was max's idea. The crotchety uncle? I never said he was crotchety. Are you reading dickens again? I am, actually. So then what's he like? Basically, big kid with all the toys and no responsibility. Cute? Yeah, but see aforementioned "big kid". Can't take him seriously. Oh, too bad. I really would like you to find someone now that you're done with law school and can't use "I'm always busy" as an excuse. Yeah, um, zoe, I'm gonna have to call you back. Ok. Video link established and the kids are on with mathilda now. [exhales] uh-oh, what's up? So mr. Lee doesn't like fancy. Which means as much as I love the plaza ballroom and the amazing job they do for us every year... It's definitely fancy. Yeah. Mr. Lee's going to be arriving in the states in less than a week. He's meeting with us and york ventures to see who he feels more comfortable with. Well, he should totally pick us. York ventures already has a ton of business in taiwan- which means we need it more which means we're gonna work harder for them. How do you know that? I do pay attention, you know. Do you? Yes. My mba is not entirely decorative. So what're you gonna do? I don't know. I also don't like to go to charles with a problem if I don't already have the solution. Well, no pressure but the christmas party is next week. Thanks. You know what I do when I'm trying to figure something out? I know it's not make a list. No, but it is have fun. ♪ deck the halls with boughs of holly, ♪ ♪ fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, ♪ ♪ 'tis the season to be jolly, ♪ ♪ oh, look! -Puzzles! -Hot chocolate! I'll... And I'll...

He tried and tried to get me to sit still to learn how to play chess but I could not do it. I guess that's why he became the engineering professor and I didn't, huh? So 2,000 pieces? It'll take between 15 and 20 hours on average. So if we work a couple of hours each day we'll be done on christmas. Oh wait, you're leaving before then. Well then we'll just have to work harder, won't we? Hey. Oh, hey. I need your orders for the hot chocolates. The options are... Oh, a list. Shush. There is iced hot chocolate, frozen hot chocolate, salted caramel, cinnamon, belgian dark, and peppermint white chocolate. Peppermint. Salted caramel. Really? I would have totally called belgian dark. I am a man of many mysteries. Mmmhmm. Max, good to see you again. Hey, gus. Come here often? Only every christmas when he practically buys me out. Well, it's uh, no big deal. It is a big deal. The boys and girls club are always sending me their thanks because this one won't put his name on the gifts. Well, today we are here just to buy this puzzle. Here you go. I'll be right back with your christmas cupcake. Jessica. Phil, hi. Having some christmas fun? I am, yes. Good, glad to hear it. Especially since we plan to keep you very busy once you start in our department. [laughs] I am looking forward to the challenge. That's what I like to hear. Let's hit the ground running. See you soon. Ok. Who was that? My new boss as of January 4th. You're not working for uncle charles anymore? Not directly. I'll be in legal. Is that fun? Probably not fun. But steady. Have you always wanted to be a lawyer? Mmm, not necessarily. But I always knew I wanted to help people. Like me. A lot like you. I like fun. [laughs] well, do you like hot chocolate? Yeah! Ok. Is this helping you come up with a solution? Alas, no. But it is delicious. Solution to what? Jessica has a problem to solve. And when I posed it to your uncle max his solution was to have fun. A suggestion which you followed. I did. No regrets. What's the problem? I have to change the company christmas party. Very last minute. Thank you for hammering that point home. Oh, you're welcome. [laughs] why do you have to change it? Because your uncle charles wants to impress a very special guest that he wants to do business with. And the plans that we have right now won't accomplish that. What did you have planned? A very fancy party at a very fancy hotel. But mr. Lee- that's our special guest. Right. He doesn't like fancy. Uh-oh. Uh-oh is right. What does mr. Lee like? Family. That's nice. That is nice. But it's also very vague. I mean, how do you show family? -Not at the plaza. -No. Maybe you could have the party at someone's house. I like it when I go to friends' houses for parties. True. Homes feel like family to me. Huh. That's a really great idea. We should have just asked you first. Good job, em. Up top. Ok, so now I just have to find a house. Darlington. What? It makes the most sense. My family used to throw huge parties growing up, and it's connected to us, which is the whole point. You know, if I didn't know any better I would say that you, mr. Darlington, know a thing or two about business. Well, it's a good thing you know better. Hmm. [laughing] what? You've got foam on your mouth. Where? Here? Right here. [laughing] still? Yeah, it's still there. I'm meeting lena thomas in town tomorrow for coffee and also to give her the update on the kids. Ok, cool. I'll totally corrupt them while you're gone. Excellent. I'm also gonna call charles about the changes to the christmas party. I mean, unless you wanna tell him, 'cause it was your idea. Well, yours and emma's. No, you go ahead. You sure? Yeah. He won't listen to me, but he will listen to you. Or anybody else. Trust me. Story of my life. A find all of the corners and the edges. Then you group them together. Very logical. Thank you. I wanna help. Promise not to take the pieces away? They gotta stay together. I promise. Ok then. Where's jessica? She's in town meeting with ms. Lena. Has she told uncle charles our idea yet? Uh... The christmas party at the darlington house? It's the most logical place for a party of this size on such short notice. But that is not the only reason. Oh? I heard york ventures will be doing the wine and dine route with mr. Lee when he's in town, which means the best way for us to separate ourselves from them is to show the people of darlington in a family-oriented setting. Ok, ok. I can see that. That's a good idea. That was actually max's idea. -Max? -Yes. He's a lot more dialled into the company than I ever realized. [laughs] we're talking about max. -[knocking] -yes, max! And he's been really great with the kids, too. Good, good. And I had another idea. I think that we should open up the christmas party to the families of darlington corporation's employees. To families? Yes. We've never done that. Well, it's because we've always had our events at locations that weren't family friendly. But it can't look like a circus, either. It'll be different, but I really do believe that we can thread the needle between professionally impressive and family-oriented. There's a lot riding on this, but ok. I trust you, jess. It's gonna be perfect. [laughing] aww. Thanks for keeping me updated. I've never seen them look this happy. I'm glad they're in such good hands. It was the right idea to have them stay here over christmas. Can I ask you a question? How did you get into family law? Oh, same way most people do. Personal experience. I had family members who were trying to navigate the legal system and it inspired me to become their advocate. I interned at a family law firm for a while. What drew you to family law? Something similar. My mom passed when I was a junior in high school and my legal advocate got me through a lot of tough times. What stopped you? Finances. I had to work my way through college and then after graduating I got the job as an admin at darlington to save and then went back to night school after that. And that's when charles hired you on as his ea. Is that why you chose corporate law instead of family? Because of where you were working? It was an influence, yes. Understandable. Family law is hard and it is not always rewarding. But when it is, it touches your heart like nothing else. Listen, I know you're about to start a new position, but in my opinion you have exactly what it takes to be a great family law attorney. At least consider it. We can talk later. Max: J. Henry that looks great. J. Henry: Here... [laughing] emma: Smells good. What's all this? Christmas cookies! [laughing] it seemed like a good idea at the time. [laughing] everything is perfectly under control. I have no doubt, mrs. Brooks. What if mrs. Brooks wasn't here? I would have so much doubt. Are you gonna join us? Of course. Where are the raisins? What- wha- raisins? You can't have raisins in christmas cookies. Of course you can. No. It's either shortbread or sugar. I like shortbread. I like sugar. See? I like oatmeal raisin. No. No oatmeal raisin. I can't believe I'm explaining to you the rules of christmas cookies. The only rule is that they have to be shaped into something christmas-y, like a santa or a star. No, that is 100 percent not true. It's 100 percent true if I say it is. Oh, this is the thing that you're gonna rebel against? We all have our chosen battlefields. [laughs] what about you, emma? Do you have a favourite christmas cookie? I like toffee. As did your mother. How did you know? I used to make it for her. You did? Yes. She taught me how she liked it, with cinnamon? Yes. Do you remember how to make them? No need. I have her recipe. It's in here. Ah, here we go. That's mom's handwriting. Emma, would you like to make some toffee? Ok. Ok, so what do we need here? Uh, sugar... ♪ silent night, ♪ ♪ holy night, ♪ ♪ all is calm, ♪ ♪ all is bright... ♪ ♪ round yon virgin... ♪ the kids are asleep, or on their way, I hope. Excellent.

I just passed along the solution you helped me come up with. Well, getting them to take it seriously is half the battle. Is that why you don't get more involved with the company, for real? Maybe. I think I um... I kinda fell into the trap of the younger brother, lower expectations thing and it became a trend. Mmm. By the time I graduated charles was already running the company and there wasn't really a role for me. But you're the president. Yeah, but we both know that that's in name only. Do you want it to be more? I used to. But um, life had its own ideas. Yeah. I get that. ♪ ...So tender and mild ♪ are you thinking about your mom? ♪ ... Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ christmas has a way of bringing up a lot of memories. I hear ya. It's been a while since I celebrated. Like this, with family. Yeah, me too. Not that we're family.

You guys are giving awesome suggestions. This christmas party is gonna rock. Thank you. There's zoe. I'm gonna pop over for a quick hello. Ok. I'll meet you at santa's workshop. Hi. There you are. Is she here? That's a no. Ah. Well, maybe it's not no but not yet. Or it's no. I should have been braver, given her the flyer myself so she knew I wanted her here. I mean, what do I really know about her besides adorable and an excellent baker? Ok, breathe. [laughs] distract me. Where's the cute not crotchety uncle? Max is over there. Red scarf. No way. That's your max? [laughter] well, he's not my max. Wait, do you know him? Uh, yeah. He volunteers in the paediatric ward being awesome. Why didn't you tell me? Because I only know that guy as max, or cute max, as some say. Cute max? Yes. Empirically, he's very well put together. Also, a really good person. Remind me again why you don't have a crush on him? Well- I- I mean, he's... He's max. I have never thought of him that way. Yeah, you do tend to get tunnel vision and forget to see what's in front of your face. There are other craft options. I like pine cones. Pine cones are fun. Not if you step on them. Then don't step on them. Right, kids? Yeah. Yeah. Your friend zoe looks familiar. Yeah, she's a surgeon at st. Francis. She recognized you, too, from your volunteer work which you have never mentioned. Well, we haven't spent that much quality time together. Do you tell charles about it? Or your work with the boys and girls club? There's no reason to tell anyone any of it. Why? Because then it takes away from it. You should do the right thing because it's the right thing to do, not to brag about it. Oh, kate showed up! Whatcha doin'? Last minute tweaks for the layouts for the party. You're working very hard at a job you technically no longer have. Because it is important to me that I do a good job. Plus, I don't want your brother to think that I don't appreciate him for all the years of support he gave me so I could get my degree. Charles is the lucky one. I don't know how your replacement is gonna live up to your legend. Especially after this christmas. Everyone is acting like me volunteering to help watch the kids is something extraordinary. It is. That's part of what makes you the amazing jessica. [notification alert] [door opens] hey, abby. What's going on? I had a nightmare. Oh no. What about? A fish. A fish? It was a really big fish. Oh. That's scary. Will you read to me? Yeah, of course. What've you got there? The wizard of oz. Ooooh. I love this book. [clears throat] [reading] "hour after hour passed away "and slowly dorothy got over her fright, "but she felt quite lonely, "and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her "that she nearly came deaf." hey. Everything ok? Do you know where abby is? Um... [max reading] "at last she crawled over the swaying floor "to her bed, and lay down upon it "and toto followed and lay down beside her." "in spite of the swaying house and the wailing of the wind, "dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep." she just had a little nightmare but I think she's ok now. She usually comes to me when that happens. What's wrong, honey? I just- I'm worried about them getting too attached when we just have to leave again for the boarding school. Especially after you just left your aunt. Em, you know this will still be your home even when you come back from paden. And if I have my way you'll be coming back here a lot. Get some sleep. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. ♪ thank you. You're welcome. [clears throat] you're getting really good at this uncle thing. You think so? I feel so uncertain all the time. I think uncertainty is a part of parenting. [laughs] parenting? Mmmhmm. I never thought of it like that. Then why did you offer to help me? I mean, you could have gone to whistler with your buddies. Well, when um... When the accident first happened charles was right. We weren't ready to be guardians. And mathilda, she's a wonderful person so it made sense them being there. I wanna do more than just visit them once in a while. Growing up, jarrett was my idol. My parents were older and a little distracted and charles already had his own life by the time I came along, and jarrett was there for me. Always. So showing his kids christmas- it's the least I can do. You're doing a really good job. You promise? I promise. That means a lot. Late night snacking? Yep. And it is way past my bedtime. Goodnight, everyone. Goodnight. Max... Don't mess this up. I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do. I was there the first time you saw her. You almost ran into a door. I... No, I... [sighs] she's way out of my league, mrs. B. Listen, I've watched you grow up. I know that there is so much more to you than you let even yourself realize. Yeah, but... She doesn't take me seriously. I mean, why would she? Oh, my dear max. You have to figure out how to take yourself seriously before anyone else will. I think I may have a crush on max. Yes! Such good news. Is it? Because my head is kinda spinning. Because he's too handsome? Because it'll change things. Into awesome. Into the unknown, and you know how much I hate the unknown, which is why- take the chocolate fudge instead of the christmas roll fudge because chocolate is safe while christmas roll is oddly exotic albeit in a still safely christmas way. Wow, you just went down an analogy rabbit hole. You followed. Jess, sweetie, you can't be too cautious because then you'll miss out. Do you think I'm too cautious? Sometimes. Oh. I never used to be. When I was young I was bold and brave. I remember your eighth grade tap dancing ventriloquist talent act. You are never gonna let me live that down. Never. But you being cautious after losing your mom makes sense. Maybe I am missing out on some things. Hey, do you wanna go dress shopping with me? I have a sudden compulsion to look really, really good for tomorrow night's christmas party. I can't. I have a date. [gasps] [laughs] I wanna hear everything! [giggling] jess? Hey, max! Hey.

Sorry, I wanted to be refreshed for the big day tomorrow, and of course to see my beautiful nieces and nephew. How are you all? Children: Good. I like to hear that. We made ornaments! And went on a carriage ride with a horse. And we're building a christmas puzzle. That sounds very christmas-y. Alright kids, let's get cleaned up and ready for dinner. Charles will tell us about his trip later. Can I have some hot chocolate? I think that can be arranged. Come on. Hey, when did max become mr. Rogers? Max has been full of surprises. Hey, charles? Yeah? Could I talk to you for a second about my role at darlington? Your role? Yeah. About doing more. Can we talk about it after the christmas party? I'm pretty wiped out from the trip. Yeah, sure. Alright, thanks. [jazzy christmas music plays] ♪ ♪ that's a nice suit. Thank you. You, too. Thank you. Oh, wow. Don't you two look pretty? Thank you, uncle max. You both look pretty, too. Thank you.

Can we come back? [laughs] yeah, any time. Sounds like you and jess have been having fun with your nieces and nephew. Yes, the kids have been great and, well, jess is amazing. No argument here, and I know she's really enjoyed spending time with you and the kids. Hi. Hi. So wonderful to see you. Good to see you, too. Have you seen the children? They're over by the christmas- I saw. They are having quite the time. I'm glad to see that things are going so well. Well, max is really great with them. Well, emma says that you're a big part of making them feel at home, too. She does? Hmm, well, they make it easy. Have you thought about my suggestion? Yes, a lot, actually. I hear a "but". I don't have any practical experience. You have something better. Personal experience. And instinct. Neither of which can be taught. I just owe so much to charles and darlington. I mean, they have been incredibly generous to me over the years. I see. Well, you have my info if you should change your mind. Thank you. Hi. Hi. You look really beautiful in that dress. Thank you. You look very handsome yourself. Thank you. What time are you heading to whistler tomorrow? I'm- I'm not. I- I pushed it 'til after christmas and the kids go to paden, so... That's mr. Lee. That is mr. Lee. Do you mind if I... No, go. I'll be right back. Mr. Lee. Max darlington, charles's brother. Nice to meet you, max. And you. So how was your flight? Oh, not bad. Not nearly as long as my flight from harbin. Harbin? You know, I was in harbin about five years ago for the ice festival. Have you been? Of course, yes. It's one of the best winter experiences. Oh, totally. My favourite part was the um, uh, the lantern art fair. Mine, as well. I'm taking my daughter there in January. Oh, well, we should meet up. Victor. It's so good to see you. Charles. I'm sorry I missed you coming in. Oh, it's ok. Max and I were just discussing the harbin ice festival. Oh. I wasn't aware that darlington is a family-run company. Well- yes, I mean family has always been an integral part of darlington corporation, starting with our grandfather and great uncle and now continuing with charles and myself. Good family, good company. This is our motto at liuxing motors. Victor, I would love to introduce you to some of our other board members. Of course. Right this way. Ok, max, good job. I'll take it from here. Yeah, but we were just in a conversation- this is a very important deal. I'm aware of that- max, just go do what you do. Go have fun. -Hey. -Hey. You must be freezing. Thank you. You're welcome. You ok? You seemed upset. No, I'm fine. Did something happen between you and your brother? No. Nothing I'm not used to. It's just hard to change people's opinions of you, especially when they've held them for so many years. Charles only sees what you show him. It's what we've all seen. I know that there is so much more to you. Well, it... It helps when somebody believes in you. It does. And I do. Uncle max! Jessica! Hey, abby. What's up? I made some more outdoor ornaments to replace the ones the birds ate. Nicely done. What's the carrot for? A deer ate the snowman's nose. [laughs] these are so beautiful. Mr. Lee. Hi, I'm jessica lew, charles's personal assistant. [speaking taiwanese] merry christmas to you, too. And a pleasure to meet you. Victor saw the lights from the window and wanted to come take a closer look. I put two new ornaments on the trees to replace the ones the birds ate. They're ok for animals. I'm delighted to hear it. This is our niece, abby darlington. Yesterday we built a snowman. Do you build snowmen? As a matter of fact, I do. I was telling your uncle max about taking my daughter to the harbin ice festival next month. Perhaps you could come visit us, and bring your uncles, too. Well, that sounds like a great idea. That is an excellent plan. Shall we? Yes. You have a lovely family, charles. I couldn't agree with you more. I'm so happy you came. Thank you. ♪ -good morning. -Hey. Excellent. You two are exactly who I wanted to talk to. Can you join me in the office please? We are in business! Mr. Lee? Wants darlington corporation for the joint venture in taiwan. That is fantastic news! Congratulations! To you two! One of the big factors in victor's decision was how welcome he felt at our christmas party. You were right. He puts a great deal of emphasis on family in everything he does, which was why he especially liked that we put emphasis on family at our christmas party. So I wanna thank you both. Ah, we were just doing our jobs. About that. Victor made a point of saying how much he enjoyed your company, max. Really? He did? Yes, and he's looking forward to going to harbin with you and the children if they can get the time off school. Yeah, well, that's gonna be fun. Also, I wanna... [clears throat] apologize if I was short with you last night. You've done a great job. Thank you, charles. So you wanna be more involved with the company? Yeah, I do. Well, that is great because victor specifically asked for you to be the liaison on this deal. Really? Really. I don't- I don't know what to say. I'm so surprised. You think you can handle it? I can. Good. You'll need to pack your bags. Excuse me? Well, if you're gonna run the taiwan division you'll need to get started immediately. Your flight leaves Thursday to taipei. -This Thursday? -Yes. But that means he's gonna miss christmas with the kids. That is unfortunate but I will be with them until they settle at paden, then I'll fly over to join you. This initial trip is to lay the groundwork, then you go over in February on a more permanent basis. I'm proud of you, max. Congratulations. Thank you. Congratulations. Thanks. Yeah, it's um... I'm just... Trying to wrap my brain around it. Yeah, of course. But it's a great opportunity and you wanted a bigger role in the company and you got it. What's wrong? Nothing. [children chatting upstairs] we gotta tell the kids. Yeah, we do. You're not gonna be here for christmas? No, but your uncle charles will be. And you can teach him how to make christmas cookies and how to throw snowballs and make snow angels. [sad] ok. Will you be here for christmas? If you want me to. They're sending him to taiwan. No! Yeah. Ugh! Exactly. How long is "permanent basis"? My guess, a couple years? No. Yeah. Oh. Are you gonna tell him? What? That you... No. It is way too soon. Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other and seven days are more than enough for others. Dickens? Austen. I figured you had to see them in their christmas sweaters at least once. They're awesome. Abby: We'll miss you, uncle max! Hey. We didn't get to finish the puzzle. That's right. Well, don't worry.

Can I have the first one? Sure. ♪ ♪ ♪ we're missing a piece. I gave it to uncle max. Why? So he could think about us over christmas while he's away. I wish he was here and we could all be together. It's not the same. Yeah. ♪ ♪ can I help you with anything, mrs. Brooks? Oh, all done. Thank you, though. How far away is paden? It's in vermont. Near canada. It would take approximately five hours to get there. But can we live here on the weekends? It would be impractical. Oh. I really like it here. Me too. We'll get used to paden, like we've always done before. She's right. I'll be right back. [knocking] can I speak to you for a minute? Sure. What do you know about riverside school down the street? It's excellent. Why? I think the kids should go there instead of paden. Riverside isn't a boarding school. I know. The kids would come home every day here, do their homework, eat, sleep and just be regular kids. Who'd watch them? I would. You would give up your career as an attorney to watch my nieces and nephew? No, I would still be an attorney. I mean, it is the 21st century and there is a happy medium between kids in boarding school and me giving up my career. Fair enough. I mean, if I can be your full-time ea and go to law school and pass the bar I can do this. I am excellent with time management. Yes, you are. But why would you wanna do this? Because I love them. Seven years, seven days, seven minutes. It doesn't matter how long I've known them or that they're not related to me. I want the best for those kids because I love them. Hmm. Ok. Ok? Ok. We can work something out. Ok! Lena was right about you. She said you're an excellent advocate for the children. Lena? She told me that she approached you about coming to work for her. She did? Yes. We've known each other since college, there's a mutual respect there. So have you thought about her offer? Well, yes, of course. And? I turned it down. Why? Because I already have a job. I think. Jessica, you will always have a job at darlington. The question is, is a job in our legal department the one you truly want? No. I don't wanna be a corporate lawyer. I wanna be in family law. I've- I've always wanted to be in family law and protect families and I- I think I just forgot for a minute. I'm glad you remembered. You should never settle. Can you watch the kids? Sure. Wait. Where are you going? To be bold and brave. [voicemail] this is max, leave a message. Max? Call me when you get this. ♪ [phone ringing] [voicemail message] this is lena thomas. Please leave a message. This is jessica lew. I thought about what you said and you are right. Family law is where I belong. I am going to take you up on your offer. [tires screech] you're here! Yeah. Where are you going? To the airport. To stop you. What's wrong? No, nothing. Nothing's wrong, I... I just realized that I don't want you to go so I thought I would tell you that and then, you know, maybe you wouldn't... Go. Wait, are you being impulsive? I am. I- I made a list. You did? Yes. Of all the reasons to stay and go to taiwan, and I gotta be honest, there was a lot of reasons to- to go but... Only one big one to stay. Which is? Love. I love the kids and... I have been in love with you for two and a half years since the first day I saw you. And I know I have a lot of work to do to be worthy of you. You inspire me in so many ways every single- sorry. I'm just- I'm being impulsive again! [laughs] is this gonna be a thing? Maybe. I mean, 'cause I was in the middle of a pretty good speech- [laughs] I love you, too. You do? I do. Even though I may have just lost my fledgeling career? Let's find out. Children? Children: Uncle max! J. Henry: You're here! I thought you were getting on a plane. I was, but... Ok, here's the deal. I want to have a greater voice at the darlington corporation. I think I can add value and I wanna make you proud. And I'm very aware that not getting on that plane to taiwan undermines those goals, but I can't leave the children and jess, especially during christmas. I see. And I still think we can make it work with taiwan and mr. Lee, even if I don't live there. And I'm still open to going to taiwan after the holidays. Uh-huh. But I understand if you wanna replace me as liaison. Max, one of the first things you gotta keep in mind when we're negotiating is who has the leverage. And right now you do. I do? You do. Mr. Lee asked for you. I'm not gonna get in the way, especially when the reason you want to delay the trip is 'cause you wanna be with the kids over christmas. How about next time you just tell me? We can work it out. So we'll leave in January? January sounds great. But not for too long. [laughs] and charles, one more thing. I don't think the children should go to paden. They should be here with us. It's what's best for them. Charles, I think you know that. I do. Which is why I agreed with jessica that they'll go to riverside down the street. Oh. [laughing] it was a good speech, though. It was. So we're not leaving? Nope. The three of you are gonna be staying right here at darlington. Yes! This is your home. I want my own room. What about your nightmares? I'm not worried. I wanna stay in dad's old room. Absolutely. Then I'll get a room of my own. Shall we come inside and get ready for christmas? -Yeah. -Yeah. Great idea.
