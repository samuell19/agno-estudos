That's 3300. I don't have any change. - I'll have a telephone token, thanks. Sure. Bye. No, it's more than that what worries me. This is the third letter already. How long is this going to go on?! No, no, I've got other worries. That's good, okay. Ciao, Esmeralda. I'll mail the orders on my way home, doctor. If there isn't anything else... You can go, I'll close up. You should be thinking about getting some rest. You've been working too hard. Or would you like some coffee? No, thanks. See you in the morning, doctor. Good bye. Good bye. Is anybody here? Would you stop at the pharmacy, please? It'll only take a minute. We're closed. - I need just an aspirin, doctor, please. I said, we're closed! Go! Don't worry, it'll start in a sec. Help! Help! There's been a murder! They killed him! Oh my god! Murder! Help! What happened? What happened? They killed him! Oh god, how awful! Did somebody call an ambulance? It's too late for an ambulance, you should call the police. Come on, let's get going. You shouldn't get dragged into this. Do you think it was a holdup murder? - I don't know. You have to admit, she's great! It's getting late. Let's go. - Yes. ??? ??? The audience is quite ecstatic. - I don't know... Do you have a crush on her? It was better than yesterday. - Better? I thought it was worse! Good evening, Mara. - Good evening, Michele. See you later, okay? - Well done. Carlo! I haven't seen you in ages! - I was away for a while. Well, Mara? Did you read it? - No, I haven't had the time. Well, you should. Our friend Carlo here has written some beautiful scenes. He has? So he must have more brains than you! I wouldn't go that far. Look, I want you in the cast. Just read it. Alright, just give me a few days. Okay? A few days. - Good bye. Mara, wait. I wrote the major part especially for you. A mysterious, fascinating woman. This is your part. Don't push me, please. Lukas. You really have a talent for showing up at the wrong time. Hasn't anybody tried to break you of that habit? How you've been? Six months is a long time. Did you get rid of her? - Her bitter cynicism and her cruel laughter broke my heart. - That sounds awfully cheesy. What a fool... At least you've learned something new. - A little bit. Still smoking the same cigars? - I'm conservative. I want to change, so get out! What a shame, I've never seen you naked. - Out! There's no smoking here. Are you ready, Mara? - Just a second! Your smoking gets you on everybody's bad side. I'm sorry, Paolo, but you'll have to excuse me. I thought we had a date! - I know, but we really have to talk. You do whatever you want, right? - I'll be outside. I'll be right there. Don't be mad, Paolo. Ciao. I think you want me to come up. No? Poochie, that's enough! Come on! Ciao. Do you mind the cigar? - I have two suitcases. Hey, I just got my neighbor to say hello again. You're unbelievable, but I like you. Okay. Can I stay, or do I have to get going? Of course you can stay. - The bags. Oh, the bags. Everything's the same as it was, including the smell of expensive cigars. Hey! Good, you finally realized that you can't live without me. More sob-stuff? It's just because I need a place to hide, how's that? It stimulates my curiosity. What's going on? You know... Somebody tried to kill me. So I'm your private eye, huh? Tell me the truth and nothing but the truth! That's no laughing matter. Alright, tell me all about it. - Let's talk some other time. Put some music on. Do you have a lot to do? - No, it'll take half an hour tops. Good morning, signor Karman. - Morning. Good morning. Your neighbor is really strange. - I've never seen him with a woman. Really? - I thought he was gay. Dezzan called me on the day he was murdered. He was all in, it was awful. He wanted to visit me, if only he had time to. To die like that... You couldn't have saved him. Don't you think it was just a coincidence? It most certainly wasn't a coincidence. They were exactly like the calls you've got. It could still be a coincidence. In my line of work, things like that are to be expected, Esmeralda. I've got enemies. It could be that somebody is just trying to frighten you by calling. Somebody who knows things. Hello? Who is this? What does that mean? They hung up. This strange noises... Do you really still think this isn't coincidental? I don't know. I don't know. And you have no idea who this person is?- No. Do you know someone who is capable of that?- No, I have absolutely no idea. It's horrible. Mysterious barking, a confusion of voices, march music... Somebody really planned to kill me! - At least you have the tape. It's my hobby, and it's almost part of my profession. Play the recording, maybe you can make something out of it. You really understand these machines. It depends on the frequency, but after all, I'm an audio engineer. How long will it take? The studio is only a couple of minutes away. Come along, and we'll see. I'll be glad to. I think they're all on one and the same frequency. Try filtering it. Lift it to 20. Lift it again. That's a regular beat, rewind. Try it at 120. Rewind. This rumbling sound might be an incinerator. Play it again. That doesn't work, let's hear it again. What kind of dog could that be? I don't know, but it sounds like a bloodhound. For me, it sounds like a Doberman. What could that mean? - I don't know, I have to think about it. Think about it? Yeah, you should do that, maybe you remember something. Shall we hear it again? - No, rather not. I have to go now, all of this has upset me. Thank you, thank you so much. Tell me, how much do I owe you? - No, it was a neighborly favor. Thank you. Hello? - This is Giovanni Bozzi's office. I'm not in, but you can leave a message. This is Esmeralda, please call me. Call me right when you get in, it's urgent. What? - That's all I have. You'll have to wait for the rest. - I can't. I expect you to pay on time! Here. Pay within a month, or you'll be in trouble! I've always paid you on time, you need to wait a little. Yes, I know you've always paid, but this time, I can't wait. I will pay you, but I expect some discretion. I don't want any trouble. Okay? Of course, after all, my business affairs are not a thing for the public. ...the gangsters were therefore able to escape. All arterial roads have been closed off, but so far with no success. The robbery was planned dead on time. The police are certain that this is the work of organized criminals. The estimated amount the robbers heisted is about 240,000,000 lira. Other news of today: A middle-aged woman, Esmeralda Messori, was found brutally murdered in her apartment today. The body, discovered by neighbors, showed signs of sadistic cruelty. Police believes she was killed for motives of personal revenge, apparently, nothing was stolen. Oh my god. Why did he... What an idiot! Just a second! How do I get out of here? What's wrong? Good evening. - Good evening, signorina. Can't you get by? - No, look at that. Only an idiot parks that way! Locked. You might make it. The last time I tried that I got a big dent. How about me giving it a try? Without a dent? - Without a dent. Please be careful. I beg you. Somebody tried to kill me! In the car! It wasn't about you. I'm the one that he wanted to get! Darling, you should get some rest. It's your turn, signor Bozzi. I... I don't know what to say. And I can't go to the police. I want you to listen to this latest tape recording. Yes, but this is more than just a call. Somebody tried to kill you. Yes, that true, and yet I'm helpless. You can't possibly be without suspicions. Who runs a risk of being killed without a reason? There are plenty of reasons in this business. I know, I know. Well, I won't bother you any longer. You've been so kind, I'm sorry for getting in your hair every night. If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask me. Thanks. Good night. Hello, Bozzi. It's your turn now. You gonna end up just like your friends! Like Dezzan and Messori. You can't run! - Turn that off, Lukas, and come to bed. Yeah, just a second. - What do these sounds mean to you? Listen carefully. The Dobermans, do you remember?! There are things you'll never forget. - Wait a minute. That could be important, let me hear it again. The Dobermans, do you remember?! There are things you'll never forget. That's strange. What's wrong?- It reminds me of that day I got back to Rome. I stopped at a pharmacy to buy some aspirin. I was there when they found the owner murdered. His name was Dezzan. We're closed. I said, we're closed! I think the murderer knows who you are. He's afraid you might recognize him. I was a shadow! I only heard his voice. Why didn't you tell me? This is no joke. Why didn't you go to the police? The police couldn't have helped me. And you always spend hours there! I wanted to avoid that. - Yes. But in this case, there's a real chance you might get murdered. Oh my god, now I'm in this, too! - I get it, I'll start packing. Wait a minute! Don't be ridiculous, let's listen to the rest. It's just a question of time, you're gonna pay! You can't get away from me or from justice! This is Esmeralda, please call me. - Esmeralda? Call me right when you get in, it's urgent. - That's the woman who got killed. Just a second. I have a feeling that I've seen her somewhere. Esmeralda is an odd name. I've never heard it before. There it is! It was her photo! Esmeralda Messori. We saw her the other day with Bozzi. I'll say it's her. I guess Bozzi was pretty close to her. Wait a minute. Dezzan. Messori. Bozzi. Threatening phone calls. An attempt to murder the girl who heard him whispering... No, no, we should call the police. - But why? Why? You meet the killer at the pharmacy, and you don't say anything! He comes to your house and you don't say anything! If you get caught by the police, you'll get locked up forever! Bullshit, they don't have to arrest me, they need to protect me! I hope you know what you're doing. Honestly, I really don't know. I'm sorry you had to wait. I had to make a phone call. Your aunt and I were close friends. You live here, too? - No, I arrived today from Padua. I can't tell you how sorry I am. It's terrible, I can't wrap my head around how senseless it is. I think you should know a friend of your aunt, a pharmacist, was murdered. His name was Dezzan. Did she never mention him? No, I don't think so. I didn't see my aunt very much. The last time I was in Rome I just saw her very briefly because of the trial she was involved in. - What trial? Didn't my aunt tell you that she was a jurywoman some months ago? No. We hadn't seen each other for a long time. Excuse me. Come back later, we're closed. - I was hoping to see signora Dezzan. Yes? Can I help you? What do you want? - I'd like to ask you some questions. I've been to the police. - I'm trying to find out who killed your husband. Maybe you can help me. When my husband came back from the war with Peretti, the ceramics dealer, he almost had a nervous breakdown. For a few years, we lived up North. A few years after that, we decided to settle down here, where he opened his pharmacy. But I'm not telling you anything useful. Did your husband have any enemies? - No, everybody respected him. He was active in the community, for example, last year, he served on a jury. He was on a jury? Who was on trial? - His name was Ferrante. Yes, that was his name. The trial upset my husband terribly. Why? Could this be important? I wonder. I found something. Take a look at that. Ferrante escaped from prison. He escaped?! My goodness. Please come in, the judge will see you now. Please. Sit down. What can I do for you? I just need some information, but the matter is really serious. Yes? A year ago, you presided over a murder trial, and the jury sentenced the man to fifteen years. Pasquale Ferrante. Yes, I remember. It was particularly unpleasant. Ferrante escaped from prison two months ago and he's still at large. Is it about that? That's right. A man and a woman who served on that jury had been murdered. Biagio Dezzan and Esmeralda Messori. Yes, I remember them well. - But that's not all. A third, a man named Giovanni Bozzi has been threatened with death. It looks like a case of revenge, and if the jury is threatened, the judge is in danger. Not at all. I remember him well. He uttered threads, but kept maintaining his innocence. Most criminals do that, believe me, they get carried away in the moment, they're angry. But the police is on this case again. You can let them handle it from now on. Good bye, thanks. - Good bye. How should I know where he is? I already told the police and the papers. I haven't seen him in months. I don't know where he is, and that's the truth! I understand. Doesn't Pasquale get jealous? Why do you want to know? Why are you looking for my husband? Leave him alone, for Chrissakes, he's been through enough! You don't have to be afraid of me, signora Ferrante, I want to be honest. Just listen to me, I don't want you to get upset about this. He understands. Tell him to leave my girl alone, she didn't see anything. And she won't talk either. You got that? That was a cop, I'm sure! No. I know the police. Is everything alright, signor? - Yes, everything's great, thanks. Do you think this guy's finally gonna leave me alone? Yeah, I hope so. What if he wasn't the killer? I've been closely following the murder trial. I'm sure that he's guilty because he has a solid motif against the victims. Damn it! What's on your mind? Lukas? He didn't do it! - Who? Ferrante. He isn't the killer! Dezzan and Messori were killed by the same person. Well, that excludes Ferrante. The pharmacist was killed, as you recall, with a knife. But the police found out that the killer was right-handed. So? - Very simple: Ferrante is left-handed. How do you know? When I went there, there were two coffee cups standing on the table, the handles pointed in opposite directions, of course he was there. She held the cup in her right hand, do you understand? Besides, I read that his nickname was "Lefty". So we're back where we started? - Yeah. You go ahead, I want to talk to Bozzi. I'm looking for signor Bozzi. I don't think he's home, come back later, maybe you're lucky then. It's not that important, thank you. Good bye. Judge? Can I speak with you, judge? Judge! I'd like you to be here, he client insisted that you handle the mix personally. I told you, I'm busy for a few days. You'll have to do it by yourself! - Okay. See you. - Good by. Don't turn around and keep your hands on the wheel. Ferrante... Wow, aren't you smart? - Hey, let me explain... Turn right at the next corner. - Listen, I just want to... Shut up. Turn right, I said! You and me, we have to work out some important stuff. Move! You could have spoken to me at the studio instead of bringing me here. I want to talk to you in private. Why did you come to my house and squeal on me?! Tell me! Just wait a second. At first I thought you murdered those jury members, but now I know that you're innocent. Somebody tries to pin this on you. That's why I came to your house. - And then you went to the police! Look, you can trust me. Trust you? I'm not crazy. Jump. Are you out of your mind, Ferrante? Jump! I've got nothing against you, do you understand?! Nothing against me? You make me sick! You pinned the blame for those murders on me, but I'm innocent, innocent! If you kill me, nobody would believe that you're innocent! And you won't get away with that! Do you hear me?! I think you're right... Mara! Mara? Mara! Mara! Mara? Mara! Darling? - Are you crazy? You scared the hell out of me! - I wanted to scare you. You little bitch... Hi, inspector. How's it going? I found out that we're in this mess up to our necks. Let me recap the facts. First. We've got this jury members, two of them are already dead. The pharmacist Dezzan, signora Messori and Bozzi, the loan shark. Second. Ferrante escapes. Dezzan and Messori are murdered two days apart from each other. Bozzi almost got killed, but fortunately you were in the garage. Third. And there is this innocent girl, who made some mistakes, but she has heard the killer's voice. Fourth. I conclude that the main suspect, our friend Ferrante aka Lefty, is out of the picture. But that means we don't have a killer or any motifs left. I think that's really depressing. Am I waiting to be done in? That's not quite right. Aside from Ferrante, there must be some other connection. Bozzi, Dezzan and Messori weren't just members of the same jury, they must have had something else in common. - But what could that be? Peretti. Dezzan's wife mentioned him. He runs a wholesale ceramics business. Good morning, how can I help you? - Is doctor Peretti in? He is. Doctor Peretti? There's a gentleman here to see you. Yes, of course. He will see you now. - Thank you. I don't need to be remembered. You don't forget things like that. But there is a little difference. Dezzan wasn't a prisoner of war. He was in Germany, but he made a getaway to his friends, the Nazis. What was he doing in Germany? It happened when the war was almost over. If he had come back to Padua, he'd been arrested and executed by the allied troops. - Was he a fascist? It's all in the past. To me, it seems more like contemporary history. What did Dezzan do? I've already told you more than I wanted to. More than I should have. I think it's better if you just forget it. Okay, take it from the top! Good, sweetheart. Okay, just relax, sweetheart. Try the twirl again. You really have a crush on her, right? - Yes, I do. I'm here every day, thanks to you, the show is more of an excuse. But I think you won't get anywhere. - Because she won't accept the part? Or because she won't accept me? Here's my advice: Forget about her, forget what a beautiful creature she is. She'll make you look like a fool, she gives you a big smile and then she disappears. No, I'll keep going. I'm not a man who likes defeat. No-one does. Move your arms faster, and look downstage! Yeah, like that, good! Again. Yes. Let's take a break. You should take a tip or two from him. - That was really great, sweetheart. We'll have a dress rehearsal tomorrow, but I'm sure everything will be fine. Wait here a minute, I'll be right back. I said there's no smoking! - I'm just waiting for Mara. You can wait outside. - Yeah, okay. Sandra? Is my dress ready, Sandra? I just finished it, I'll get it out of wardrobe. No, I'll get it myself, thanks. Turn the light back on, I'm still in here! Damn it, I can't see a thing! Lukas!! Lukas... I can't put up with it. You gotta help me, please. - Sure. I'll do everything I can. The police, all these questions, all these suspicions... Come on. Calm down, it'll be alright. Try not to think about it, just listen to the music. I'll be right back. - Please don't leave me alone. There's no need to be scared anymore. Just relax. I'm not going far. Signor Bozzi. Signor Bozzi! Signor Bozzi, open the door! Open the door, signor Bozzi! Bozzi! Open the door! Stop banging on that door! I'm sorry, signora. I need to speak to signor Bozzi. Signor Bozzi left town this morning. What was that noise? Bozzi left town. I think he did the right thing. I can't take it anymore, I'm leaving, too. Do whatever you want, got to the police, but don't ask me to stay. I'm just so tired... - How the hell do you think I feel?! I'm really worried. You know everything! I put up with a lot, but I can't take it anymore, I'm running on empty! Paolo had nothing to do with it, it's our fault that he's dead! Relax, relax. I just need 24 hours to work things out, and then we'll do whatever you say. Okay? Lukas. Have you been up all night? You can't go on like this. Padua? Are you interested in Padua? I don't know yet. Both victims were from Padua. And Bozzi. And Peretti. It's starting to make me dizzy. I'll make some coffee. Hello? - This is Bozzi. I'm sorry, I'm... I'm on my way to Padua. No, I can't, I'm through. I'm too frightened, I'll tell you everything. Yes, I know you've got it all figured out. No, no, that won't help us. You have to trust me, please. You have to follow me immediately, at Padua you find a message at the front desk of the hotel "Majestic". Again, I'm begging you, please come immediately! Why should you trust him, Lukas? You convinced me, I think we should call the police. Not only because of me... - No, darling. We're up to our ears in this mess. Now we have to deal with it alone. - This sucks. Why can't Bozzi clear up this thing any place except Padua? Why do we have to follow him? It might feel safer for him to talk in Padua. And if it's a trap? Please be careful, darling. - Don't worry about it. It'll soon be over. One more risk, and that's it. You'll be safe in my house. Rosa's there to help you. Do you know how to use this? Ciao, Rosa. - Welcome home, signor Lukas. Welcome, signorina. I'll take you luggage. Thank you, Rosa. I'll be waiting for your call. - Take it easy, relax. Be careful. - Ciao. Signora. Signora! Signora, how do I get to the cathedral? Straight ahead, you're almost there. Hey, use your eyes! Watch it! Hello, inspector. - Hello. Excuse me, what's going on? - They killed a man in the hotel. What was his name? - Bossi, I think. Excuse me, do you know anything about the Dezzan family? What? What are you trying to say? Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah. Alright, alright, yes, yes. Good morning. I'm looking for Esmeralda Messori's apartment. But she's dead, she was murdered in Rome. It even was on the radio. You can talk to her father. He's still living here. Right up those stairs. Thanks. Who are you? What do you want? - I'm looking for Esmeralda's apartment. Are you her father?- My daughter is dead, nothing can be done for her now. I need to find out what made her afraid, what was she afraid of? I don't know, she had no reason to be afraid. It wasn't her fault. I think she was very, very unhappy. She died a thousand deaths, just like the others. Dezzan and Bozzi? - What do names mean in the end? Please don't ask any more questions. After all, I was her father. Keep on looking, don't give up. And when you have found something true, just look behind you and you'll find you're back at where you started. Didn't Bozzi have any relatives or friends of the family? No. His parents were both killed in a bombardment during the war. I see. Did you know him? - No, I never saw him. His name came up now and then, of course, and this morning, I heard about the murder. What a terrible thing to happen. This upsets me more than you know. What a awful way to die. But I know who knew him, the Feretta sisters. I think they're the only ones that will remember. You should talk to them. It's number 3, way up at the top. They already are a bit fuzzy-headed. Are you the doctor? - No. Lina! Where are you, dear? - She'll be right here. Signora. Do you remember Giovanni Bozzi? Bozzi? Yes, your neighbor during the war, do you remember? Okay. Signora? Do you remember this song? It was very popular during the war. That was during the war, no one sings it anymore. And Bozzi? Giovanni, how much fun he used to give us! I remember him, we talked a lot. She refused to go to parties, she was afraid her baby girl might wake up. The girl and her brother were such funny little things. He was much prettier than her. But he always cried for his father. The lady's name, do you recall? - The mother? She was here, she was a neighbor, too. She made a home there with Bozzi. Was her name Esmeralda Messori? - No, she was nasty and vicious. She was so jealous. Lina? Please find Lina. I want to go to sleep... I'd like to know what you're doing here. Who let you in? Please excuse me. I'd like to know about the woman who lived here with Bozzi during the war. What was her name? She was a poor woman who needed a place to hide with her children. The children in that picture? Are those hers? Are they? Yes, yes. They're her children. But who is their father, please tell me. Bozzi's dead, the poor guy. It was an awful story. Yes, hello? Good morning, signor Lukas. Yes, I'll call her, she's here. Signorina Mara! Telephone! Thanks, Rosa. Hello? Ciao. Is everything alright? No. He was murdered. But I know why now. I'll explain it later. I have a few things to do before I come back. Ciao. I hate to leave you alone like this, but we've got company tonight, and my husband needs me to be there. - Don't worry, Rosa. Lukas will be home soon. Good night. Thank you, signorina, and good night. Hello? Yes, that's right. Oh, it's you. No, I'm sorry, I haven't read it yet. By the way: Who gave you this number? No, I don't feel like going out. I really don't. Hello, Bozzi. It's your turn now. You're gonna end up just like your friends. Like Dezzan and Messori! You can't run. What do these sounds mean to you?! Listen to them! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot, I'm a friend! I'm Pasquale Ferrante, signor Lukas asked me to keep an eye on the villa. I almost caught the murderer, but he got away! I've been expecting you. The game is up. How long have you suspected the truth? Since the day I saw you going into the synagogue. Does it make sense to you, taking revenge after all this time? Don't ask me that. You'll have to judge a man who had to watch his family being destroyed. I'll remember that as long as I live. My wife and my kids hid at Bozzi's house in Padua. We thought he was our friend. He betrayed them to the Nazis, because like me, they were Jews. That awful woman, Esmeralda Messori, was Bozzi's mistress, and she made him betray my family. They were killed in a concentration camp, in less than a month. Obliterated. Except for my son, who was with me. - That explains the threatening calls. The screams, the sound of the incinerator and the Dobermans. That was part of my revenge. They had to be frightened before they died, I had to make sure they knew. But what about Dezzan? - He collaborated with the Nazis. He was responsible for the deportation of my family. It took me 20 years to track them down. But then, one day, I managed to get all of them picked for jury duty. I wanted to see their faces. A man was on trial for murder. Ferrante. But they had committed murder. I wanted them to receive the death penalty. Hurry up, Lukas is already here! Now you know the facts. The whole truth, as we say. - You don't know the whole truth! Lukas! You haven't heard the full explanation. There's something else you should know. My father would never commit murder. The only thing he wanted was to see their faces in court. I wanted more. - Shut up, Carlo. Don't say a word. No, dad. I want them to know everything. A few months ago, fate presented an opportunity. This Pasquale Ferrante came in very handy for me. I knew he would come under suspicion. This time, he was looking pretty guilty. - Stop it! So I was right when I came to you. You knew what was happening. I told him later when he wasn't able to do anything about it. He didn't blame me, he wanted to protect me! Why didn't you stop him? Nobody could. You don't feel ashamed for what I've done, do you? Before God, they were all guilty. It was right for them to die! You said... You said, I was too young remember because I was just a child back then. You said it was just an accident, but you knew better. My mother and my sister were killed! Don't you understand?! You are crazy. You hear that? And you don't say anything? You were the one who told me the truth. I knew you had always hoped that somebody would do it for you. I'm the one... ...who did it for you. What happened is a tragedy. Only now do I begin to understand. I've made both of us lose all sense of reality. Forgive me. No, dad. There's so much left for us to do. You have to finish it. You can't let these people go. They know too much. You have to kill them, there's no other way. No. Yes. Kill them. Kill them! No.
