Gorky Studios, Zodiak Studios and Sirtei Mikhail Kalik (Israel) Present A new edition of the film: TO LOVE... Some common stories, with observations. Based on stories by: I. Drutse, A. Zaka, I. Kuznetsova, Y. Kazakova, V. Sapozhnikova Scenario and direction: Mikhail Kalik Cinematography: D. Motorniy Composer: M. Tariverdaev With S. Gurzo, L. Krugliy, A. Leftiy, S. Svetlichnaya, A. Freindlikh, G. Shvitki Tell us: what do you think about love? About love? I don't know... Love, in my opinion, is a great feeling. Very bright. It's when you want to do something good for other people. When you love, the whole world becomes beautiful. Everyone thinks differently about love. But anyway, love exists, I've no doubt. Only it doesn't come to everyone. It's a great gift of the soul, I think that it's a kind of talent. You want me to tell you about love? It does exist. But these days it's rare to find. Because now we degrade it. Especially among the young. They don't understand what it means to love. In our day, we knew how to love properly. Love is a sacrament. Do you understand me? That's all. About love? What can I say about love? So far the subject doesn't concern me. I'm serving in the Soviet army. Well, I once met a girl. We became close. The first day I spent with her was so nice! I was in love. Just great! I'm telling you the truth. On the second day I noticed something wasn't right. - Did you love her? - Oh, certainly. - Did you understand it was love. - I understood everything. And then... You know what? I realized I wasn't the only one she was meeting. There were three, four others. Yes, love is a really beautiful feeling! Every Soviet person deserves it! Tell us what you think about love. Love? Difficult to say... A pleasant activity. What can I say about love? I, for one, am very, very happy about the fact that this thing exists. And I have only the best things to say about love. It makes you feel so good, it gives you wings. And even if it's a sad love, that's all right, too. His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me. The Song of Songs Why are you standing in the rain? I'm looking at the sky. And what can you see up there? Different things at different times. The clouds, the stars. You're wet... and you're cuckoo. - And you? - Same as everyone. Gray. Gray? Yes. I just cover myself with colorful clothes. Let's go. A man should live like the things around him aren't changing. The difference is only in speed. Before people went by horsecart, now they have jet planes. The important thing is to be on time. Where? To each his destination. For these two, a deserted island. So this our Earth. It's round. I've never been out of Moscow. I've never seen anything else. I wonder if there really are flowers growing beneath the snow. I think in the old days people behaved more modestly. How so? Kissing, for example. And what? Did they kiss differently? Only when they were in love. And now? You kiss me, but you don't love me. I can't understand why. Why do you ask childish questions? It's pleasant, that's why. What, can't I kiss you now? If it's pleasant, Igor, of course you can! Are you afraid of death? They're laughing like idiots. That was wonderful! I've just turned it on. - Now speak. - I'm so silly! Speak, the tape is running! - What should I say? - Whatever you want. What? OK, let me think a moment. I don't know what to say. You're such a... Say what you want. Hurry up! Oh, I... I... love you! I love you. Love you so much. I don't want you to go away! I want you to stay so much! I've become so tired of waiting for you! No, that's not what I meant to say. No, that's not it. I will wait for you! I love waiting for you. I love when you return. Unexpected... like sudden snowfall. I have no idea what else to say. And you? You're an old man, but silly like a boy. But I love you. Love, love, love, love... My darling. About love? I never speak about it. Just to talk about it into a microphone... It just seems to me... Love doesn't deserve such. To be talked about into a microphone. It deserves much better. I think love's a great thing. I'm always ready to love, but now... eh! I've a lot of work, so no time for love. Oh, and I have a husband. But I'm ready for love! Difficult for me to talk about love, maybe because I haven't experienced first love. I don't know if first love even exists. Love, in my opinion, first of all, is based on... spiritual ties. Between two people. First of all. And after... frankly speaking, of course, on physical desire. You also can't do without that. I can't understand why you must apply labels to love. You mean love is when people understand each other instantly, is that so? Yes, that's my opinion. I think it isn't right to try to apply labels, because love can be different. Everyone has their own kind. And there is a painful love, when people misunderstand each other from the start. Such kind of love also exists. There can be marriage for profit, but not love for profit. When people marry young, let's say, they still don't have standards. They're still like different continents to each other, unknown. They try to join together. Then they get married. And afterward material needs and everyday life... start grinding them down, tiring them. And feelings begin to fade, only the facade they display remains. Materialism, social position... and when it no longer satisfies them, the whole structure tumbles down. People just fall apart. Actually we can speak much more about this subject, but... Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee. - The Song of Songs Your hands smell like heather. In Scotland the honey comes from heather. You're beautiful, Yuliya. Very beautiful. While you're sleeping I'll be wandering the city all night. No, it's better you go home. Don't get burnt by the fire, don't drown in the water, don't wander into the dark forest. Hey, Miss Snowstorm! Listen to me: there's the scent of heather in this town! All right, let's dance, you tart! Hey, pay attention! Man, I'm really sorry! It's fine. Excuse me, why are you crying? I'm crying, so what? Oh. Maybe you lost some money? Money? What money? I haven't lost anything. What do you want? I haven't lost anything! Anyway, it's none of your business! The trolley's going to the terminus. Why are you looking at me? It would be better if you weren't here. You know, you've misunderstood. I didn't have bad intentions. I just saw you crying and wanted to help. Crying just makes things worse. Don't be sad, it'll pass. Maybe you'll get home and find a letter on your table. Or something like that. It's important not to give up, to keep your spirits up. That's easy to say. Nothing's waiting for me on the table. Of course, I don't know your situation. But everything will pass. I've felt the same sometimes. You think this is the end, then you wake in the morning and it's all right again. If I'm not bothering you, I'll just sit right here. Maybe you'll feel better. You're very young, but very kind. I won't cry with you here. But on my own, I'll cry all the time. It's good to be young! Every sorrow quickly fades. Talk some more. You don't bother me. You have such kind eyes and your voice is pleasant. Goodbye! Or maybe you can accompany me. - All right. - I'll just drop off the money. Frozen yet? Let's go! I don't live far away. What's your name, by the way? - Serozha. - Sergei? My name's Anya. You must be hungry. Wait, I'll make something. Go on, sit over there. Get warm. I'll make some tea... I have some cookies and cherry jam. Do you smoke? Because I have some cigarettes if you want. Were you surprised to see me crying? It's all because of that one there! I haven't yet removed it. We lived together, I treated him like a husband. I wanted to be happy. I'm just 25, I'm still young. I got pregnant but didn't say anything. I wanted it to be a surprise. I bought a baby carriage. And he said: "What do we need kids for? Get an abortion." I cried. And my mother... she was living with me at the time. She said: "Don't do it." I didn't listen to my mother, I listened to him. And he left a note at the hospital. "It wasn't serious. Don't try to find me." This lousy clock. If it doesn't tick, I can't sleep at night. Wait. We'll eat in a moment. Today I thought about killing myself. And I'd do it. I'm so hot-tempered. Silly! I saw him on the bus... he said he married a school teacher. And I couldn't help but cry. It was like he was bragging about it. Anya. Do you still love him? I don't know. He's lodged in my soul. Hanging on the wall there, and I can't take it down. You know what? You should just throw it away. He's a rotten guy. Look at his face. Like the king of clubs. And fix your clock, too. He mocks you, and you tolerate it. Stop this suffering! Fight! I understand that you're a woman, but it doesn't matter. Now I'll show him! It's done. Funny guy. Just gone and broken it. Serves him right. It's fine, I have another one. But no, I won't hang it anymore. Everything of his I've kept I'll throw away! His cologne, his mirror. All of it! Fate has sent you to me. Is he the only man in the world? Am I any worse than other women? I can sing, I can dance, I'm good-natured. And I don't love him at all. He's just stuck in my head. It's time I left. Maybe... it's better you spent the night here. No. And tomorrow I'll accompany you home. Look at the time! Where are you going? Up to you. Where are your gloves? Here, take mine. Or I won't let you go. Keep them, to remember me by. You've helped me. Farewell. I'm convinced that at the heart of the unity of man and woman lies something metaphysical. The secret of gender is the great mystery of nature. Man is neither only spirit nor only body. Man is a unique combination in nature of physical and spiritual being. These are of equal importance in the merging of man and woman. There's no sense in dividing them, yet we still do it. Quite often we can see in relationships how love erodes when sex is predominant. This is one result of the separation the physical and the spiritual. Like performing an autopsy on a living man. Dividing one thing from another. And as a result we see a caricature of love. We shouldn't do this. On the other hand, speaking of Platonic love we smile and wink. Because it's also become caricature. Anyway, it's harmless caricature. But love built only on sex is dangerous caricature. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits. The Song of Songs Don't go. How foolish. First I went north when nothing between us was settled. And now you're going north. It's silly. Don't go. What can I say to you now? Not a good idea to stay at your relatives'. They're always at home. So where? Your place? Well, it doesn't matter. Let's go to a hotel then. You could stay a few days more, right? The train's leaving soon. Wait a minute. Just think it over. After all those letters, we can stay together again for awhile. Think it over. Will you be happy if I stay? Excuse me. - Let's go. - And the ticket? Spit on the ticket! - To a hotel! - Which one? - Any. Just a minute, old boy. I'll be right back. NO VACANCIES Any room. The best, the worst, doesn't matter. Understand? No vacancies. Sorry, I wasn't talking to you! Well? - All right, let's try another one. - Let's go. - What do we do now? - I don't know. - Shall we go to a restaurant? - Yes? Yes, I'm hungry. They're all closed! - Let's take a walk. - Let's go. So we can't go to your place? If we could, would we be out walking? My parents are there. All right, don't be sad. Tomorrow I'll go. There's a train in the morning. And then... Later you'll join me. In the north. My feet hurt. It's these shoes. We can just sit like this, right? You're a good man. I love you, you fool. I fell in love with you back there, in the north. And you didn't even notice, poor guy. - Let's go to that entranceway. - Let's go. We'll sit on the steps, I'll take off my shoes. We aren't very lucky in Moscow. Yes. It's a very big city. Hey, get out of here! A curse be on you! Devils! Aren't you shameless! Like cats in heat. Get out of here or I'll whistle for the cops. Yes. It's certainly not the White Sea. Never mind. Let's just walk to the station. Maybe we can sleep on the benches. All right. Wait, I'm an idiot! Why don't we just get out of the city? We can take a taxi. I have enough money. We'll go 30 km or so out. Agreed? Will you take us out of town? Out of town? For seven and a half rubles, sure. All right. How about here? It's not much of a forest. I'm sick of this. Dear God, I don't need anything. I don't want anything. Let's go back. If back, then back. But let's have a drink first, because I'm tired of carrying this. - Drink. - I don't want to. Let's go. All right. I'm going. Don't be angry. People are lonely, they can't even live in society. And they need a language with which to communicate. In fact, language sometimes only hinders. But people who love each other - man and woman - often don't need words. In this process, we are able to enter into that which the Kingdom of God promises us. A full unification of all people. Complete overcoming of all tragedies and catastrophes. A process that will lead us to infinite brightness. At the moment of falling in love, a person experiences a state of eternity. Experiences God. It's possible only for a person with a deeply developed soul to experience this. Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under thy tongue. - The Song of Songs Why have you stopped singing, Mircha? It's all right, I'll finish it another time. There'll be other fine evenings. Don't wait too long, Mircha. Sing as long as you can. Later... who knows? What do you have in your bag? White bread. Want some? Can you get up here? No, I can't. Is it nice up there? Marvelous. - Let's take you on up. - How can we do that? Just like this. Right foot here... step here. Left hand like this. Move your right foot... wait, stop! Oh God. Mircha, better I just walk back. But... why? It's not very far. Goodbye. Bye. Look at that treetop. The cherries are ripe. Do you like cherries? I do. Then climb up and get some. I don't know... I might get caught. Go on. Don't be afraid. They won't catch you. Come on, stop crying. Enough! Let's take a look in your bag. If you feel like you're going to sneeze, rub the bridge of your nose. - Where's your hat, Mircha? - Traded for a bottle! - Your father'll tell you off! - He was out with me! - Good morning, Aunt Katinga! - Good morning, Mircha! - Hello, Niku! - Hello, Mircha! - Where are you bringing the hay from? - I've stolen it! Watch yourself, I'll catch you. Ha, no way! Thank God, looks like no one's around. Well? Climbing down or not? What're you looking for? Nothing. Then why stop here with your cart? The harness got loose. Did you throw this rag here? I think it's your bag. Meet your future daughter-in-law. Here, unload that hay! But be careful. Kiss the bride! Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death. - The Song of Songs In Christian doctrine marriage is based on the teachings of Christ, who tells us of this great mystery. The New Testament states that the love between man and woman in marriage is a great mystery. (repeats words in ancient Slavic) It states that the mystery lies in the unity of the two. Two as one body. The Old Testament says that the man will leave his father and mother, and joined to his wife. Let there be two as one flesh. This is the basis of Christian marriage. It's not just two people living together. And not just friendly relations, not just sexual relations, it's an absolutely unique, unrepeatable fusion of two beings. As though when one of them is beaten, the other feels the pain. So, therefore, here in the church marriage is a sacrament. I have a man, I love him, and this loves makes me happy. And... I don't know what else to say. This man is my first love. I'd never loved a man before. I think it's the best feeling! I wish all people in love the greatest happiness! I don't know. It's too late for me to think about love. I already have this child in my arms. I don't care anymore, leave it to the young folk to worry about. Love... love is a wonderful feeling. But obviously you have to treat it very seriously. And try to keep it. It's very easy to let it run through your fingers. These days people talk a lot about love, too much, I think. It's become worn out. In my opinion, maybe it's better we talk about it less. Because it's two people's private business. Something about love? I don't think anything, I just love. It's late. It's too late to love you. You're going away, like a train, a train, a train, a train. And I'm alone on the platform. It's only rain and I. Sky, stop weeping! Please, stop weeping! Let me cry instead. Instead of you! The wind, it understands me. And it embraces me. The wind, the wind, the wind. It's like me on the platform: lonely! God doesn't have, God doesn't have, the happiness that we had! It's late, it's too late! There is no hope to stop the train. Late, late, late! The train, the train is far away. It can't be brought back. Rails, you stretch so far away. Far away. Rails, rails, rails, rails. But there's no place for me on that train! There's only a leaf in my hands, yellow leaf, yellow leaf in my hands, like a train ticket! It's late! There's no hope to stop the train. Late, late, late! The train, the train is far away. It can't be brought back. Late, too late to love you. You're going away like a train, train, train... THE END
