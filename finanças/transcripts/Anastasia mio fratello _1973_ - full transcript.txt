-Come! Over here! -Pay attention to the friar! The friar! Over here! I'm here! -Father Salvatore! -Everybody, stop. Father Salvatore. You're required. Come, come over here! The Father Rector has to talk to you! There's some news for you. Don't dilly-dally! It's urgent! Yes. I'm going. I'm coming right away! Please. May I? Father. I'm here. Father Salvatore. -Well, how did it go? -Not well. We lost, three to nothing. I think they got lucky. They're Capuchins. What do you need me for? -A letter from your brother in New York. -It's arrived! -It's arrived. Are you happy? -I'm ecstatic! Here it is. Inside is a steamship ticket and two checks. One for our seminary, the other for the Maritime Association of Father Elia. I don't know why. Alberto has never forgotten the old sailors. He always remembers the old fisherman who took him from Tropea to Naples, where he took a ship to New York. -When should I leave, Father? -Let's see... -Departure: Naples, December 15, 1949. -'49. It's this year. Boarding: 4:30 p.m. -What's today's date? -Today? So... December 13, Saint Omobono. Today, Saint Josaphat, December 14. Tomorrow, 15 December, Saint Albert the Martyr. It's tomorrow! It's tomorrow. You have to leave. Tomorrow. I have to leave tomorrow. To America! -Father Salvatore, wait! -Are you going to America? -Father Salvatore! -Father! MY BROTHER ANASTASIA Father Salvatore! I gave you some butirri that Alberto loves so much. Thank you, Reverend Father. And you, please, pray for me! Have a safe trip! -I'll write you from America! -Goodbye, Father Salvatore. Have a safe trip! Don't rush it! Here we go. 203, 204... 205. Here it is. Good morning, Father. -Who is this? -Good morning. Oh, my travel companions. Nice to meet you. Are you Americans? -Yes. -I don't speak English. I only speak Italian, Latin and Calabrian. -Michelangelo? -No, sir. Much more than Michelangelo. These are butirri, exquisite Calabrian cheeses. Smell it. Can you smell the sea, the mountains, and our meadows? -You sleep in here 10 days with these? -No, I keep my eyes open. We can't break these, or they'll change the flavor. They must travel intact. I hope the ship will sail smoothly. -Let me take care of this. -It's disgusting. It really stinks. -It's gonna stink up the whole place. -Customs will confiscate them. The law forbids importing pecorino from Sardinia. From Sardinia, yes. This is from Calabria. New York Customs won't care if it's Calabria or Sardinia. My brother will explain it to them. Alberto Anastasia is the big cheese of the New York Harbor. -You're Alberto Anastasia's brother? -Yes, sir! What? His brother? I'll be there right away. I see. Those Americans have protested, and you send me away. Could you follow me, Father? Yes, I'm coming. What, will you force me off the ship? Excuse me, please. Happy? I'm leaving. Have a good trip, Father. Thank you very much, Father. Listen, you Americans... I come from a small Calabrian village, and you live in the greatest country in the world. But you do not understand me. Why? Because you're ignorant. Otherwise you'd know these butirri were made before Columbus discovered America. Word to the wise. Thank you very much. Praised be Jesus Christ, and you should say, "Always be praised." If you know that. Otherwise, I'll tell you. -I'm Alfonso Canone, the Purser. -It's a pleasure. -Here. The best first class suite. -Yes? First class? I've never met your brother Alberto. Well? What do you say? This is wonderful. It's magical! Can I stay here with my butirri? Here, the smell of the Calabrian mountains won't bother anyone, Father. This is too much, Mr. Purser. My ticket is for third class. -Don't you worry. We're at your disposal. -Thank you, Mr. Purser. God bless you! How kind, this Mr. Canone. He looks like a canon dressed as a sailor. -Good day. - Same to you, my dear lady! -This is the dining room. -Mr. Purser Canone! What a wonder! What is all of this? A fry shop? An ice cream parlor? A pastry shop? -Welcome here. -Thank you, Captain, for your invitation. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Please, sit down. I'm not worthy. -This is Father Salvatore Anastasia. -What a beauty! This is a magic castle. This is a miracle. How can this boat stay afloat, with all this stuff inside? -Anastasia? -Yes, ma'am. I hope this man is not related to that notorious gangster. -Pardon me, Father. Do you speak English? -Captain? I'm sorry, not a single word. How can I say? Excuse me. It's been seven days that I've been sailing on this amazing floating city. I've met important, highly placed people-- kind, pleasant and caring. Everyone knows my brother Alberto. Those who don't seem to admire and to respect him. Soon, I'll meet him too. I'm anxious to hug him close to my heart. Only a few hours left. Tomorrow, we'll be in America already. I'll get up quite early, as I want to see the breathtaking skyscrapers which God has allowed to be built so tall to be closer to Him. Father Salvatore Anastasia. Father Salvatore Anastasia. -Here I am! Who wants me? It's me. -Come to the first-class lounge. -Here is Father Salvatore Anastasia. Yes? -The Purser wants you. Here I am, Mr. Purser. How can I help you? Your passport, Father. -My passport? -Welcome to the United States. -Thanks a million. -Father Salvatore? We're here for you. Big Al sent us. -Who's Big Al? -Your brother. -Alberto? Why do you call him Big Al? -Big means grande. And Al is short for Alberto. He's grande Alberto. Big Al. Grande Alberto. Nice! Are you guys Italian? Yes, yes. I'm Santandrea Bonolotti, but to the Americans, I'm Sonny Boy. -You? -I'm Tony Esposito. -Is this my luggage? -Yes. Let's go. Wait. Passengers have to wait five hours before disembarking. They told me so. -The passengers, maybe. You're Anastasia. -Another thing. In this basket I've got butirri. They told me they can't pass. -Pass where? -Customs. -If your name is Anastasia... -You've passed already. -So, shall we go? -Father Salvatore! Don't forget to mention me to your brother, Alberto. Mr. Purser Alfonso Canone, we won't forget it. Thanks a million! Goodbye to everyone. Praised be Jesus Christ. Shall we go? At ease, my dear. Nice doggies. Do they bite? And what's this? Good morning, Father. Good morning, my dear. Good morning. Good morning to you, my dear. How many doormen are here? I can tell here in New York you're afraid of bandits. Like you say, gangsters. Good morning. Are there a lot of gangsters here? -Get out, Father. -Yes. Salvatore. Alberto. Oh, it's good to see you. Finally I meet you, Alberto. I've only seen portraits of you. I've always remembered you in my prayers. And the Lord has chosen for me to meet you in this faraway America. -Let me see you. -Yes. Look at me, Alberto. What do you say? Was it worth it to spend so much money for me, to make me become a priest? -Are you afraid of priests? -No. Because you're a good priest. A good priest. But not a priest who's good, Alberto. I am strict. When you'll come to confess your sins, I will not be indulgent. Because I'll give you some penitences! See? A priest scared you! -God bless you, my brother. -I like that priest. -He's okay. -Fine. -I'm truly happy. -Me, too. Let's go inside. -How's Mom? -She's fine. Actually, I promised her I wouldn't go back without you. Don't you worry. I will go back with you... and forever. Don't tell anyone, though. It's a secret. Between you and me. -Let's go in. They're waiting for you. -I'm ready. What a view! Come on. Let's go in. I feel like I'm in a dream. -Welcome, Father. -Good morning, dear. -Thank you. Thanks a lot. -My pleasure. -What a princely palace, Alberto. -You like it, huh? -Hooray for Father Salvatore! -Is it your family? What a family! My dear people! -This is Tony. Gerardo. -Who are you? Tony? Gerardo! -Luigi. Giuseppe. My wife. -Luigi. Your wife? Oh, madam! It's a pleasure! Her sister. Her cousin! Her niece. God bless you. How many of you are here? Men, women, old people, kids. This large, beautiful family! And what a beautiful Christmas tree! How many presents. -They are all for you. -For me? -Yes! -Good! Evidently, I've been good and you've been bad, because I've got you nothing. Look at what I've got for you! The holy picture of the Holy Father with his particular blessing! Do you like the holy picture? Do you like the holy picture? -Yes. Yes. -Don't you like the holy picture? This is Saint Patrick's Cathedral. San Patrizio. That's Mother Cabrini, the saint of the immigrants. To think, Alberto, that the only American saint is an Italian one. Saint Cabrini. -Father, you're very handsome! -For real? Take this, Sonny. I feel naked. Thank you. Come, Toruzzo. I've got a surprise for you. -Where are we? -My barbershop. My personal barber. See? I disembarked right there, on October 14th, 1916. The whole trip, I never saw the ocean. I was in the hold, washing dishes. The cook, from Calabria, took a liking to me. As we got here, he took me to his brother-in-law who had a bakery on Mulberry Street. So I started to knead the bread. As a baker, I was a disaster. So I thought... "Did I come to America to become a baker?" I heard at the dock they were paying well. 10 pieces a week. So I gave it a try. But it was a tough job with no schedule, no insurance. Nothing. No protection, and hundreds of men ready to take your job. They were tough years for immigrants. Mainly Italians, Greeks, Slavs... So I figured out I had to do one thing: Learn to speak English. And that there was only one way to gain respect. To show no fear. And make them understand I had no fear. Now, do you see those workers? They had their gratifications. They were unorganized. Now, thanks to our union, they've gained a lot of rights. -Hey! Hey! -Good evening. Good evening. -What do you say, fellas? -What's up? How are you doing? How are you? They all greet you obsequiously. Everybody knows you, eh? Here the kids only know Tony. What is your job here at the docks, Tony? Nothing. I'm just taking care of 40,000 dockworkers who are loading and unloading. That's my legacy. I did fight to defend the dockworkers. I've got a lot of enemies. What now? Go see what's going on, Tony. Forgive me. An ambulance? -Police? What happened? -I don't know. Quick. -Some incident? -Shall we go see? Take it back. Up. That's right. All right. Back. Back. Bring it back. All right, hold it. Now. Down now. Let it down easy. All right? Fine. It's not my fault. I really don't know how that could happen. Another job by Murder Incorporated. We should warn the papers... Did you hear? Another Murder Inc. job. Alberto. Are they alive beings who've been thrown in the water with their feet in concrete? Yeah. That's terrible. But here, these things happen. -Listen, Tony, I better take him away. -See you later, Al. How is that possible? How can things like that happen in a country so advanced? Toruzzo. In America, violence is a national product, like Coca-Cola. Okay, try to forget this ugly thing. You'll see, this country is very nice. Now I'll take you to lunch inside one of the tallest skyscrapers in New York. There. This palace is called Rockefeller Center. Sit down. Yes. This America is all pretty. But it's a tough country. If you can't defend yourself... it squashes you. Well, tonight I've got some business to do. You have fun. I'll leave Sonny Boy with you. He'll be your chaperone. -This is Mulberry Street. Little Italy. -Little Italy! -It's a Piccola Italia. And this? -They're all Italians. -Alberto used to live here. -You can't be more Italian than that. -White, red and green. -The Italian flag. In these houses, only people from Abruzzo, Calabria and Sicily. If you speak American, they won't understand you. -Alberto started to work here. -Besides the docks, what does he do? He's got some business in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. -He's got some clothing manufacturing. -Oh, he makes clothes! I see. What a wonderful idea. Mom always said that Alberto was a very enterprising guy. Every day he has a new idea, boom! He creates it, starting from nothing. -Is this here the bakery where he started? -Here it is. Torrera's Bakery. -May I visit it? Can I go in? -Of course! -May I? -Guys, look who's here! Big Al's younger brother, Father Salvatore Anastasia. -Praised be Jesus Christ, everybody. -It's Big Al's brother! -He came here! -Anastasia's brother is here! -He came here! -He's a priest! A priest! Don Alberto's brother! -So, are you Alberto's brother? -Yes, madam. I'm Colomba, from Treviso. I'm the sister of the parish priest. -What a pleasure! -Your brother got married in our church. -Listen! -And your nephew got baptized. -It's a small world. -Come. My brother wants to meet you. Goodbye. May God bless you all! Goodbye! See you soon! Look at the state of our poor church. Your brother Alberto has abandoned us. Now he goes to the Fort Lee parish. It's a rich people parish, you know? Everybody left us. Look at the pews. They're dusty, filled with holes... Look at the chairs. Nowadays the only people we see here are old and poor. We barely have the money for the candles. Look. We had an organ, up there, but they took it away. Every day is harder. We hardly survive, Father Salvatore. It's a pity to see a church like this one. The Lord will curse us. Ora pro nobis. -Did you see our situation? -I did see it, and how. -How is it possible to wind up like this? -Nobody's helping us. Nobody. Ora pro nobis... -What is this music? -The end of the world, Father Salvatore. To make some money, my brother has rented out the basement. It was supposed to be a cultural club, but now it's a place of perdition! They sing, dance and do other stuff I'm ashamed to think about! -Why don't they respect this sacred place? -What respect and respect! Here they are. Look at them. See what kind of people are they? Worse than animals. They've got no respect. Ora pro nobis. Where will it end? Ora pro nobis. -Regina Martyrum. -Ora pro nobis. Regina Confessorum. -What is this? I don't recognize America! -Why did you come down here? -I'm the director of this club. -So? -I only know Father Michele. -Yes? -Yes, sir. -I am Father Salvatore Anastasia. And like Father Michele, I'm an Italian priest here in America to get to know my brothers, the Anastasia brothers. -Anastasia? You're Big Al's brother? -Yes, sir. Why? Blessed be God. Blessed be his holy name. Did you see how easy it is? I get along with kids. Oh, the rosary has ended. Hey! Your hat! Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Goodbye, kids. I'll come back to visit you and we could have some recess together. Okay, Father. Okay, you say? So I'll say it myself. Like an American. Okay! Praised be Jesus Christ. And you have to reply, "Always be praised." -Always be praised. -Always be praised. Bravo. -We found who keeps them quiet. -Yes, I noticed! -Who is he? -Guess. -It's Father Anastasia. Yes. -No! -Alberto's brother? -May I? Let me see. So you are Salvatore. -Yes, Father Michele. -Let me hug you. -We talked a lot about you. Yes. -For real? Alberto used to read me all your letters from the seminary. You became a priest. -As you can see... -Bravo, I prayed a lot for you. -May I help you, Father? -Thanks. I need your help. -I told you to sew it up. -What sew and sew. Look! Look at my brother! Here everything's old, it needs to be thrown away, everything... Lucia, would you shut up? The Father here doesn't care. -Who are you? -I work for Don Alberto Anastasia. -You may remove your hat. -We're still in church, Sonny Boy. He drove me here to Little Italy. Father, I took the liberty to go to the cultural club to talk to its director and to all those noisy kids. They seemed understanding and kind, and they promised they won't do it anymore. -Michele, can we give him something? -Let's go to the rectory, to celebrate your arrival. But do tell: How long will you be here? I don't know yet. I'll decide when Alberto returns from his trip. Come, come as well. You should stay a while. It's quite nice, here. -Very nice. Here is our rectory. -Oh, delightful. Upstairs we've got the bedrooms, including the vice-pastor's, which is empty. -Why don't they stay for dinner? -Oh, yes. I hope you'll stay with us for dinner. My sister has a lot of defects, -but she's a good cook. -For real? Is she good? -I'd be delighted. -Shall we have him, too? I don't know. Shall we? Excuse me, Father. I have to take you home. I must run some errands for Don Alberto. Sonny Boy, you may leave. Let them know I'll have dinner with Father Michele. My brother Alberto is still afraid. He doesn't see me as a priest. He treats me as a child. But I have to learn to walk alone in this big America. -This is our living room. -Nice! Quaint. Cozy. -May I help you? -No, I'll manage. Fix a drink... Come, Father Salvatore. My home is your home. Do tell, Father. Did you decide to leave when Alberto comes back? It's my idea. I'm afraid I'll get bored here in New York. I don't speak the language. An Anastasia doesn't need to know the language. Everyone knows him. Yes, my son. Excuse me, Father Salvatore. -Who will take you home? -Not to worry! I'll get a cab. Sonny Boy, there must be cabs in New York! We have them in Tropea! Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! They have taxis in New York, but they never stop. Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Taxi. May God bless you all. -What now? What happened? -Sorry, Father. -Are you Italian? Me, too. -Yes. Don't hail a cab this late. They won't stop. They're afraid. If I may, I will escort you. Let's go, Father. Thank goodness I've met you, or I'd have spent the night hailing cabs. -My house is over the Hudson River. -You live in New Jersey. You need to catch a bus. It's ten minutes. You say it'll be only ten minutes by bus? What, are you crazy? Killing a priest brings bad luck. Thing is, my village has only two streets: a main one, and a secondary one. That's why I'm a bit lost, in this big America. Hi, Mike. We were looking for you. Your wife is sick. Excuse me, Father. I'm sorry, I don't understand. I don't speak American. -If you have to go with your friends... -Yes. Mike is busy. -His wife Teresa is very ill. -Are you Italians, too? Are you an Italian priest? I'm an Italian priest, even if I wear pants. What a pleasure to meet you. -You may go with them, for real. -No, I can't. Really. -I promised to escort you. -But your wife is ill. It's better if you get in. Fine. First you drive me home, and then the Father. -They'll take care of you, Father. -I wouldn't want to bother your friends. Among us Italians... Wonderful! This is something I like to hear in this wondrous land! May I? Scoot a bit. -How many Italians are there, here? -More than a million. In all of America? -No. Just in New York. -Holy Toledo! Where do all these Italians hide, then? And what is this? A violin? Yes. So, are you musicians? -Amateurs. -We play by ear. Really? By the phone? I love music, too. I like to play it, I like to sing... Were you born here in America? I just arrived here. But my brothers have lived in New York ever since I was born. I came to know them: Giuseppe, Gerardo, Luigi, Antonio and Alberto Anastasia. Americans call him Big Al! -Did you say, Anastasia? -Yes, sir. -You're Alberto Anastasia's brother? -Yes, sir. Do you guys know him? -That's my stop. -What are you doing? Are you fleeing? Bye, my dear. What a peculiar individual. With those big eyes... Where do you live, Father? We'll drop you off. I live in Fort Lee. At my brother Alberto's villa. -Go to Fort Lee. -Tell your brother Alberto that Joe the Violinist is always at his complete disposal. The Violinist. I'll tell him. Don Gennaro. The Violinist wants to talk to you. -He shouldn't show his face here. -On the phone. Lead with that, you asshole! Yes. Tell me. Don Gennaro, we couldn't do anything. -Why? -There was a priest. -A priest? Are you sure? -Yes, sir. He wasn't "just a priest." He's Alberto Anastasia's brother! -That's why we aborted. -You did well. -Better to do it another day. Okay. -Yes. It's better. I'll call you. That's what we needed: A priest Anastasia! How do you like that? It's a Big Al move. We can't ever do anything with him. Big Al doesn't earn anything if he reveals our oil is just a front, right? New York, January. I came here to stay only a few days, to get to know my brothers and go back to my seminary, but I'm still here, among these Italians in America. I still can't speak a word of English, but my accent from Calabria is getting thicker. I'm glad to have found here in America this new, large Italian family. I know everyone, I'm always with and among them. Every morning, I help Ms. Colombina with her shopping. The only help she can give her brother is by fixing him some meal. Poor Father Michele. He's tired and unable to fulfill the needs of his poor parish. So I've decided to stay and help him, so I moved here, in the church. The problems are numerous, and they're hard to solve. I've prayed, and I found the strength to face them. Will I, a tiny priest from the country, even with the burning fire of passion, be able to jump every obstacle we find in this huge metropolitan city? Good morning. Good morning, Father. Hey, toss the ball! -Here, this is a plot. Do you like it? -It's beautiful. Wonderful! This is a perfect plot to build a soccer field for our kids. -Whose land is this? -A Chinese man who lives here owns it. -Do you know him? -Chinese people all look alike. -Can I talk to him? -Sure, come with me. Let's go, Father. -Will this Chinese guy understand me? -If he won't, I'll talk to him. Nobody's here. Excuse me. Excuse me. Good morning. Good morning. I am a priest. Italian priest. I want to rent this land for my boys of Parrochia di Santa Lucia. Excuse me. Maybe you didn't understand me. I knew it. -He seems a bit angry. -Let me talk to him. Hey. Listen, Chink. You see this man there? You have to take care of him. If this guy wants to buy this land, you have to listen to him. This guy is Albert Anastasia's brother. You understand? I beg of you, don't ruin me. I work. Don't take away this land from me. What, do you speak Italian? -Yes, I studied with Italian nuns. -So you're a Catholic! I'm a good Catholic. I pray to Mother Cabrini. Mother Cabrini! What a coincidence! She's sending me here. See, Mr. Chinese guy, I only want to rent your little plot for my kids of Saint Lucia Parish. If you pray to Mother Cabrini, you have to give it to me. Mother Cabrini had money to pay. I know, but she was a saint. She'd perform miracles. You pray, and she'll make a miracle. Let's hope she'll make a miracle and we find the money but, Mr. Chinese guy... Don't play around. The plot is mine and nobody else's, right? -Yes, I promise. Yes, yes. -Thank you! May God bless you, Chin Chun Cho. Shall we go, Sonny Boy? -Are you happy? -I'm elated. Never would I ever thought to find so much understanding in a Chinese guy. One good word, some sympathy, and we've got the plot for our kids. Sonny Boy, I asked you earlier, "Where is this shop?" You told me, "One block." One block of what? -We've been walking for one hour. -We've arrived. Father, it's your fault. I wanted to take you with the car. Never mind. I can't argue with you. May I come in? Good morning! Good morning, Father. Good morning. And that's all I know. So far. As you can see, I'm a priest, and I don't know your language. My friend here, Mr. Bonolotti, will translate. Tell him I want to see a nice organ for my parish. The Father would like to see some organs for his church. We have many instruments here. What kind of organ? -What's that? -He asks, what do you want? Tell him the best one. -Which is the best? -The Italian. This guy is a sly one. You understand I'm Italian? No, no, I assure you. They're the best in the world. Come here. Let me show you. This one, for example. Try it out, Father. -Nice! May I try it? -This is an Italian one. And the proof is that they are the most expensive. -"Expensive" means spesa? -Yes. The expense will be paid by my parishioners. The parishers will pay. Which parishers? The parishioners of my parish. Saint Lucia Parish. -Saint Lucia? -Saint Lucia. -Saint Lucia? -Saint Lucia. -What's happening? -He knows Saint Lucia's parishioners. And he knows Father Michele, too. He says they're not parishioners. They're par-repellent. Every time they've bought something, they didn't pay for it. -No, no, with me it's different. May I? -They owe me money. -I won't stand for it. -Please, mister. -No! No! -The parish has been renewed. -No, no! -I'm the new priest. -Get him out of here. -I don't have much cash, but I will. I promise you. You have Father Salvatore Anastasia's word. For the payment, you must come and see me. -Anastasia? -Salvatore. We are the bringers of Christ And his house we want to refresh Now, oh, brother come outside... Father? Who's that? Are you here? -Put them just by the altar. -Okay, Father. Open those boxes gingerly. Be careful. Put the statues in those niches. The Holy Mother to the right, Saint Joseph to the left! Guys, let's resume. One, two: We're Christ's Musketeers -Come on. This is the store. -Will he give us credit? -I think so. -Good morning. I'm Salvatore Anastasia. -Anastasia? -Yes. May I? I'm Father Salvatore, I'm here to bless this place. Benedictio Dei omnipotentis, Patris et Filii et Spiritus sancti. Amen. Benedictio Dei omnipotentis, Patris et Filii et Spiritus sancti. Amen. Benedictio Dei omnipotentis, Patris et Filii et Spiritus san-- Is this the exit? Benedictio Dei omnipotentis, Patris et Filii et Spiritus sancti. Amen. What a nice congregation. Good morning. Benedictio Dei omnipotentis, Patris et Filii et Spiritus sancti. Amen. -Who's the owner, here? -Me. Don Gennaro Impallobene. What a pleasure! I'm Father Salvatore Anastasia. -I've heard good things about you. -Same here. Don Michele gave me the names of every former important Italian parishioner of his, who have become huge personas in a country this big and this hard to conquer. -Your brother Albert is one of them. -Yes, my brother is a former parishioner. -Are you of our parish? -I'm from the Bronx. I live in Hoboken. -Staten Island. -I'm from Chicago. But you all speak Italian. Hence, you're all my lambs. La mia casa. La tua casa. La Sua casa. My house, your house, His house. You say like this. But the Lord's house belongs to all of us. Put in the money, so that it'll go back to its ancient splendor. Thanks. One bag is for the parish, the other is for our youth organization. Put in the money. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Put in the money. Put in the money, so that the church will shine again. Big men like you can have anything but big hearts. Thank you very much. Let's go, kids. -This is the oil used by Ms. Colombina. -It's good, isn't it? Good, you say? Pardon my curiosity, but where do you import this oil from? From Sicily, from Puglia, Calabria too. No, no, no. I know oil. This is not ours. This is from Albania, Morocco. It's not even olive oil. I hope you won't get offended, but this oil is awful. Yes. You Italians in America have forgotten what our flavors, our tastes truly are. Oils, wines, cheeses, oranges, lemons. We'll talk about it in our parish. Come to the Holy Mass, this Sunday. A bit of confession has never hurt anyone, Don Gennaro. What are those, golden teeth? Benedictio Dei omnipotentis, Patris et Filii et Spiritus sancti. Let's go, boys. Praised be Jesus Christ. Did you see his golden teeth? This fucking priest had to come to America to bust our balls? -Happy return, Don Alberto. -Thanks. -Welcome back, Alberto. -Thanks, Tony. -How's Salvatore? -Very good. -He's doing big things. -What things? -He made a lot of changes. -Really? Where? Guess? In the parish. On Mulberry Street. -Mulberry Street? -Yes. The bishop has named him second pastor, and he's started working immediately. That's great. Just great. What's the use in having some brothers? Why haven't you stopped him? Why haven't you called me? We learned about it after the bishop named him. -You're stupid! You're all dumb! -Why are you mad he's at Mulberry Street? Why? Of all people, you ask me why? Mulberry Street reminds me of the worst time of my life! People there are envious. Gossipy. Can't you imagine what they will say about me? Can't you see it? Yes, but Salvatore is not a kid anymore. What does he know about life? Our life? Here. Ask Don Michele. You can go. Don Michele. My dear Alberto, I'm so happy to see you. -Yes, yes. Where's my brother? -He's getting ready in the sacristy. -Did you see the vestments, the church-- -Did you convince him to come here? Me? You must believe me, Alberto. He insisted. I didn't even want that. -I didn't want it at all, but you know-- -Salvatore. Alberto! Welcome back! Thanks for coming. Alberto, did you see the church? -How splendid! And that's not all. -I saw it, I saw it. My intention is to do big things. Enormous things. I'm happy to be among these people, and mainly to be of help to these American kids. Did you know they are always in the middle of the street? We did that, too, but we were satisfied with a medal and a holy picture. Today, the holy pictures stay in heaven, and these kids need a sports center. Yes, but that needs time. And now you have to go back to Italy. Who said that, Alberto? That's why I wrote to the Tropea Dean, -because I want to stay here. Thanks. -What? You want to stay in New York? Big Al! Aren't you glad your brother priest will remain here to live next to you? Yeah, sure, but... After all, it's not my choice. It's these Americans' choice. Alberto. Do you know they like me? I simply dug into their psychology. Come here. Saint Cabrina performed a miracle. I don't speak one word of their language, and yet, as I go anywhere and I say, "I'm Father Salvatore Anastasia," every door bursts open. -The Mass is beginning. -It is? Alberto. Our sung Mass. Do you know who's singing? These voices, these boys-- I taught them! Shall we? In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, Amen. Introibo ad altare Dei. Ad Deum qui laetÃ¬ficat iuventutem meam. Oremus. Proficiat nobis absolutem corpus et anima, per Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum filium Tuum, qui Tecum vivit et regnat in unitate Spiritus Sancti, Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. Gloria In excelsis Deo... Dominus vobiscum Here. Look at this. New York, June. Everything that has happened in this period has been so quick and incredible that I think it's like a miracle. In the meantime, summer has arrived. Wonderful. It smiles at you with its first sun, like our superlative parish that now is blooming again. Califano, Califano! You kill live beings for your taste buds' pleasure. -The Pope commits the sin of gluttony too. -He can. His are fried fish! And dead. That's why this smells bad. You fish your fish from the garbage. What's that big one? -This is from the river! Come on! -How many years has it been here? -You're kidding, Father, aren't you? -Mind you. I have a delicate stomach. Four pounds of monkfish. -Good morning. -Oh, good morning. -Good morning! -Ms. Colombina, how can I help you? -What do you need? -Ms. Colombina, remember your diabetes. -Yeah, but I don't care. -Vincenzino, is your dad here? I came to talk to him. Where is he? -In the laboratory. -Ah, in the laboratory. -Do you want me to call him? -No, no, no. I'll go myself. -Mike, are you hiding now? -Nice to see you, Father. I sent for you. Why didn't you come to the church? Well, you know, Father... I wasn't feeling well. Mike, don't lie to me. You're as healthy as a horse. I prefer to stay home. That's not true, you're never home! Remember, Mike, I'm a priest. I read inside your heart. So tell me. What, you don't trust me? Oh, God! -What is this arquebus? -A memento from the war. You keep it here? Bring it back to the military! Mike, you're a peculiar guy. I want to know who you are. Come on. -Look for yourself. -Dry figs, nuts... They'll hurt my teeth. -Is your wife jealous? -Yes. -And do you spend your money with women? -Yes. You have to take the money home, not to use it on snakes. You always say "yes," but you don't do that. Mike, I want to bet again, but you must give me three good numbers. I'm sorry, you can't bet anymore. I can't pay for you. -I'm an employee. It's not my lottery. -Come on, Mike. I have to turn in the bet money. Mike, you know that when I win, I'll pay my whole debt. Right, when. But you've already lost $19. I have to balance my register, though. I'm sorry, I need the money. Forgive my intrusion, but... What are you doing? Ms. Colombina gambles every week, but she never pays. Looky here. -What is this game? -It's a race horse lottery. Three numbers. -How much does one win? -500 times the bet. Five hundred times the bet? So if I bet one dollar, I'll win 500? Yes! Here's $20. Keep $19 for her debt, and one, to bet on the race. -If you win, you'll give it back to me. -Thank you, Father Salvatore. Listen, Father, come on. Why don't you bet a few bucks? Oh, yes, do so. I smell victory. The first-timers are always lucky. Shall I gamble a little bit? -All right, I'll bet! -What numbers? What numbers? Ms. Colombina's ones. How exciting! Horse lottery. Our three numbers are 6-8-11, right? By the way, Mike never gave me a receipt. Not that I don't trust him-- -There are no receipts, here. -It's a clandestine lottery. -They never give receipts. -Mike told me it was authorized. -Sure, sure. -Yeah? But if it's a clandestine one, who's authorizing it? The organization. Many people work for the lottery. Do you know how much is gambled in New York? Two million dollars every day. One and a half billion Lira. -Did you hear that? 1.5 billion. -Yes, but look: They're about to arrive! The 8 has won. We got it right. What are you saying? The 8 won. We bet on 6. It's not the horse number that matters, but the quote the totalizer pays up on a winning horse. For us, it's the 6. If the game were based on the horse numbers, it'd be easy to rig it. Instead, nobody can know the quote of the totalizer. It's complicated, but honest. -Do they pay for two? So 11? -No, all the three have to win. -Yes, 11. -To win, it has to be in the third race. -It's tough for you to win. -Why? When a horse is given for 11, it means it's a lame duck. To win, you need to bet on lower numbers. One, two... Since you know all this, Mr. Bonolotti, do you win all the time? -I never bet. Oh, the professor! -Who? -Who's that? -He's a fine person. Forgive us. Father, let me introduce you to him. Let's go. He just got the second number. Professor Caboze, can I have two minutes? I wanna talk to you. Well, Father, I'll introduce you to an amazing character. Good morning, professor. Excuse me. Listen. I wanna introduce you to Father Anastasia. -Are you related to Big Al? -Yes, he's my brother. It's a pleasure, Father. I'm really lucky. Your brother Alberto honors me with his friendship. He used to come to the race quite often. Come here, professor. Listen. I want you to do me a favor. The Father just played the lottery. He's got two numbers. The third one is 11. -What do you say? Can he win? -11... Did you bet a lot, Father? To me, that's a lot. $2 myself, and one Ms. Colombina. Do you believe in miracles? I believe in some miracles. -Have faith. Bye. -Bye. -Who's that fellow? -They call him the human calculator. You may ask, "What's he got to do with the races?" A lot. Which horse do they give 18? -Number 10? -Number 10. So I'll play number ten. Good. Look at the numbers. They're all low. There's an 18. If they bet on it, it may come down. Let's pray, Father. Let's pray the Virgin Mary for a miracle. What are you saying, Ms. Colombina? Why, because I don't know what I'm saying? Winning at the race is not a sin. Eleven! See? A miracle has happened. Now the horse that's quoted 11 must win. -What's its number? -It's number 10. Don't you worry, it'll get to 10. Come on! Come on, run! Come on! Now! Run! Run! Bravo! -Ten! Did you see that? -We won! Did you see, Father Salvatore? You didn't believe it. It's a miracle! -We won! -The Holy Mother performed a miracle. The Holy Mother and the professor. I'll explain it to you later. -I'm sorry, I'm stressed. I'm gonna leave. -Where are you going? -To the powder room. -Did you understand? -No. Please explain it to me. -They send the bets to the central hub. The professor makes his calculation and lowers the quotes on the totalizer. You had 11? He had 18, so he lowered it to 11. -What is this rubbish? -Who cares? You won! To your health! -No! No! -Yes. -Aren't you happy? -I'm a priest. I came here only to please that old lady. Not to be involved in a racket with professors, checks, bets! Ms. Colombina, today I've learned this lottery is a swindle. Well, we won, it's fine. The parish really needs it. Tomorrow, when we'll get our money, I'll have a word with that Mike. Mike. That's a good one. He wouldn't be a bad guy, but he always needs some cash. -If he doesn't have it, he takes it. -Does he steal? Same thing. He uses the lottery one. -Good morning, madam. -Is my husband here? I am waiting for him. Ah, look. He left the padlock open last night. Your father was in a rush last night. Go wash your hands, Vittorio. This is Radio Puerto Rico, bringing you the best popular music. -Good morning, Father. -Good morning. How are you, Teresa? Father, you have to forgive me. To pay your win, we don't have enough funds. Oh, you know that already? Everybody's talking about it. It doesn't happen often. $1000. It's a nice amount. My husband will pay you, as soon as he'll be back. He's not here. He went to visit his mother. She fell ill, he said. When he's back, tell him to come and see me, as I have to talk to him face to face. You, too, my daughter. When you can... come to church, to me. I assure you, Father, if I'm a sinner, I make a lot of amends already. -Too many. I don't need the church. -I didn't tell you to come and confess. What's that? What's wrong? What happened? What's... On Saturday evening, you left here at 9:00 p.m. -Where was Mike? -He was putting away the ice cream. When you left, was there anyone inside the store? -No, just me. I left and I closed. -So everything's clear. Mike stepped into the fridge and got locked inside. Hello, Father. -It was a tragedy. Go, but be available. -Fine, Lieutenant. One last question: Do you think Mike had any enemies? Enemies? Why? He was a good guy. Everybody loved him. There should be a law for fridges to be able to be opened from the inside too. We wouldn't have tragedies like this one anymore. Lieutenant, do you believe in tragedy? -Don't you? -I have something to say. All right. Go ahead. Did you know Mike was a pick-up man? -What was he? -Pick-up man. Don't you know the term? -No. -No? So you don't know about the clandestine lottery organization. Three numbers, the horse race... -Yes, I think I heard that. -You heard? There are one thousand banks in New York, they rake in millions of dollars! Millions of dollars? What's that got to do with Mike's death? Mike used to collect the money of the bets to give to the controller, who has to give it to the banker. How come you don't know anything about this lottery? I've got other things to tend to. This is a tough area. You don't know how many murders and thefts we have every day. I know, I know. But let me finish, and I guess you'll like my story. Apparently, Mike would withhold part of the bets for himself. He always needed money. He knew bad people and women would eat all his earnings, God rest his soul. I'm sure that the lottery bosses got wind of this, and so they punished him. Really interesting. -I'll investigate. -Yeah, do investigate. You'll find out what I did find out: This lottery is a scam. -Really? -Yeah, really. And poor people must know it. And I will tell them! So we'll find out who's the organizer of this scam. And we'll find out how Mike died, too. Leaving alone a wife and two kids. Goodbye, lieutenant. Hello, Mamma Oil. -This is Kauffman. Is Don Gennaro there? -One moment, please. A Kauffman guy. This is he. Tell me. What's so important? We're screwed. Father Anastasia has found out everything about the lottery. -Did he say whom he learned it from? -No. -You should have asked him. -We have to do-- I know we have to do something, there's no need for you to tell me that. -What are you going to do? -I know what. This priest... Why is he so nosy? Pasquale! Pasquale! -Where are Charlie and the Violinist? -You told them to vanish for a few days. Find them at once. I've got a job for them. And summon the friends. -This ticket at 15, goes down to 12. -...at 15, so... So, if I've got it, Sonny Boy. The organization lets the professor know of the totalizer quote with a lot of bets. The professor, with his quick brain, buys a lot of tickets to lower the quote where there are fewer bets. Right? You understand very well. Of course. Tomorrow my parishioners will understand even better! -The parishioners? Why? -Tomorrow, during Mike's funeral, I'll get on the pulpit with my blackboard and tell everyone the lottery is a scam! -Are you crazy? -No, I'm not. It must be a scandal. Newspapers, radio, television. My parishioners must open their eyes, and the mafia must close theirs forever! Will you tell them I told you? No. Even to the lieutenant, I told him it's a secret how I know this. Don't you worry, but-- Hey, Sonny Boy. If they need you as a witness, you won't step back, right? -No, no. -Go now, I need to work and focus. So... First things first: People need to understand that-- Oh! Sonny Boy. Don't say a word to Father Michele or Ms. Colombina. Mum's the word. Go! "My dears, my good people, my faithful ones... You've always played the three-number lottery thinking of it as an innocent game while it's a dirty, terrible scam! It's handled by a dirty clandestine organization which I, Salvatore Anastasia, a puny priest, once I found it out, have decided to destroy it without pity." -What happened, Sonny? -I have to talk to Don Alberto. Wait a minute. Certainly. That's why I want you to listen carefully to what I have to say. The elections are coming up soon and the politicians are going to try to please everybody by offering them everything. Have you heard what they've been saying on the radio and TV? Yeah, I heard all about that. They say they wanna clean up the cities and the country. Well, then? These are nothing but words. What concerns me is the FBI. They use microphones as small as this cookie. They put them everywhere. Behind a light, under a table. Even in your car. -Why in my car and not in yours? -Well, mine... They check it every day. Sonny wants to talk to you. Says it's very important. Your brother figured out the lottery scam and wants to tell it to every parishioner. Damn it. Blast him! -What's going on, Alberto? -I don't know! My brother, the priest... He's causing me some trouble, and he could cause troubles for everyone. Listen. I gotta go. I'll see you later. Alberto pretends to be mad, but he's happy to have a brother who's a priest. So he has a connection for Heaven too. Don Alberto, what a nice surprise to see you. Oh, Don Alberto, what brings you here? How come you're here this late? What happened? -Where's Salvatore? When? -He went to give the last rites to a guy. -I was upstairs. Who did come for him? -Two young fellows. -Did you know them? -Only by sight. One is called the Violinist, and the other I think his name is Charlie. Oh, I know him. The Taylor. For these last rites, and with His pious mercy, may God forgive yourself of all your sins. Listen, Father Salvatore... -Here I am, my son. -My godson, Mike... You did love Mike, didn't you? -I loved him so much. They killed him. -Yes, I know. I'm leaving this life without being able to... -avenge him. -No, my son. You must forgive before leaving this life. But since I'll stay behind, I promise you I'll punish who's responsible. I'll be implacable! -It'll be in the papers, on the radio, TV! -What do you want to do? -I know! I'll tell you. -Tell me. Let me die a happy man. You must know that tomorrow, during the funeral, after blessing poor Mike's body, I'll go up to the pulpit to explain to my parishioners that the lottery is a scam! Who told you that? -Nobody. I checked. That's why I bought a blackboard to explain it better. The fur will fly, everyone will understand and nobody will ever play the lottery! I'm truly sad I won't be there. -Don Gennaro, do you know what we'll do? -No. To have a bigger crowd, to gather more people, we can postpone Mike's funeral, and we'll do it together with yours. For you it's just a matter of hours-- Oh, God! Don Gennaro! Are you leaving us already? Doctor! Doctor! Doctor, do something! He's in agony. I still have to take his confession. Send him away, and come back here. -No, go out, Father. -I have to give him the last rites. -You'll give them to him later. -He must be alive. -I promise you he won't die. -He won't? Who are you? You promise he won't die? -Do you trust this doctor? -Blindly. Too bad! You need to see whom you trust. We must throw him into the river. It's the only solution. We can't go back. -Alberto would do the same with us. -Can't we check with the friends? There's no time! Better to let them know once the job is done. And where do you want to throw him? Under the Brooklyn Bridge! -Well? So? -He can't stay here any longer. We must take him to the hospital. -Poor guy. Didn't he want to die here? -I've convinced him. -On one condition, he said. -Which one? He needs Father Salvatore always near. He said that? Here I am, my son! Prepare the van. -Did you ask who told him? -Yes, but he didn't name any names. He said, "This is a secret." You know how your brother is. -Why? How is he? -I meant... He... Sometimes he's as stubborn as a mule, respectfully speaking. Maybe it was Mike who told him. He knew someone was out for a vendetta. You're not as dumb as you look. Holy Father, have pity. Holy Mary, have pity. Blessed Saints, pray for him. In Domine... Easy, easy, my sons. Be gentle. Easy. -Where are you going? -My bag! Oh, thanks. May I? Let's go. You go in in there. You, in there. Come on, come on. Get moving. Look everywhere! Nobody's here. Damn it to hell. Do you think he's really in danger? -I'm sure of it! -I don't think they brought him here. I know for whom Charlie and the Violinist work. They'd do it only for Don Gennaro! Nobody's here. The place is empty. Hey, Big Al. This is Father Salvatore's. It's the Sacred Oil. He's been here, then. We must alert Lieutenant Coppola. Yes? Who? Put him on. Hello, Al. How are you? Listen to me, Ralph. They've kidnapped my brother, the priest. Don Gennaro Impallobene. Yeah, I know him. Where are you now? All right. As soon as I learn something, I'll let you know. Okay. Get me the radio room. Calling all cars north and northwest. Calling all cars. Stop delivery van, Mamma Oil Company. Hold occupants. Report in if you spot it. Attention. They could be armed. Car 45, we're going. Calling headquarters, this is car 179. Mamma Oil van spotted moving west on 27th Street. We'll go after them. Car 84. Got you. We're on our way. Out. Holy hell, they're chasing us! Let's block the van, come on! Oh, shit. The cops. Step on it. Step on it. Here Car 84. We can't pass them. To all cars of Zone A. Stop Mamma Oil van heading towards pier. Car 122. Van is passing in front of us. Location Battery Street. We're in pursuit. They're still right on our fucking tail. Let's get out of here. Don Gennaro, how can we do this like so? What are you doing? Slow down! Oh, God! What is going on? Don Gennaro! We can't even pray! They don't have any brakes? Don Gennaro, how are you? Nurse. A glass of water. Oh, God. What's wrong? -Nothing. Just a bit of fear. -No, thanks. Why do you say "fear"? -Am I pale? Am I white? -They forced you into the van. Force? What force? So you got in that van of your own accord. Of course, definitely. It was my duty. So you were unaware of the danger you were in, right? Me? Nobody could have predicted that accident. Nobody. I mean... At a certain point I did say, "Let's slow down a bit. It is dangerous." Maybe we couldn't. We had to be fast. We had to save a man's life! -By the way, how is Don Gennaro? -He's going to die. Yes, we know. It's been two days. And the other guys? How are they? They're in the trauma ward. They're broken. They're all broken. I'm the only one whole. It's a miracle. -May I get dressed, doctor? -So you don't want to press any charges? Charges? Do you think I should... What charges are you talking about? -Kidnapping. That's a federal crime. -It is? And whom did they kidnap? -Salvatore. How did you know it? -Alberto! It's been a terrible thing! -How is he? -He'll be all right. His head is hard. -You're telling me. -For real. I'm a rock! Not even a scratch. Don Gennaro saved me. He protected me, I swear! I'm sure! At the time of the impact, Alberto, he grabbed me so hard... -He smashed the van roof with his head. -Are you Father Salvatore Anastasia? -Sure, that's me. -Mr. Impallobene... Oh, God, Don Gennaro. Is he dead? Oh, no, no. -He's rambling but he's calling for you. -I'm coming. Hey, wait a minute. Where are you going? Didn't you hear? He needs me. He wants the last rites before bowing out. How do you feel? I'm fine. It's been a miracle. The Lord has saved me. Thank you all. -Your brother didn't understand a thing. -Better this way. Yes, it's better this way. Thanks a lot, Ralph. So, Don Gennaro, how are you? A bit better, right? Mamma mia. It seems a bit much. Have you broken everything, Gennaro? I'm dying. Well, to be honest, the accident doesn't factor. You were supposed to die a while ago. You can't complain. See, Gennaro, how just our Lord is? He didn't let you leave without repentance. -Would you like to confess, my son? -Yes. -Bravo. -Yes... -No! -Yes or no? -No, Alberto, no! -What? Oh, it's you, Alberto? Please, step outside. Don Gennaro wants to confess. -Forgive me. Forgive me! -Thanks. -Yes, my son. -Forgive me. Here I am! Do you know you look like a baby in swaddling clothes? -A big toddler! -Father... I want your brother to forgive me. You must ask God for forgiveness. What's my brother Alberto got to do with this? If I get out of this... If I don't die, he'll punish me for what we wanted to do to you. -What did you want to do to me? -We wanted to give you a coat, Father. To me? A coat? Thank you. But why a coat? A concrete coat. And then... we would have thrown you into the river, down, down, down. You were to remain there with all the others. A lot of others... Why? Why would you give me this coat? So you couldn't talk. You knew too many things, and you wanted to say them. The lottery. The professor. The swindle. Yes. Did you organize this racket? Yes. Ugly. You're really ugly. Aren't you ashamed? So big, so huge, with all those gold teeth... No... Forgive me, Father. Yes, my son. Of course I forgive you. Do you think my forgiveness is enough to save your soul, though? That'd be too easy. Our Lord is incredibly good, but people like you cause even him to lose his temper. So he'll grab you by your ear and he'll pull it so hard your screams will be heard even down here! Everyone will say, "That's Don Gennaro! That evil man who made a lot of people cry. That man who's never had pity for anyone, and now he's paying in hell!" Being forgiven is not enough. You need to make amends too. I will, Father Salvatore. I will make amends. What do I have to do? What do you have to do? You must make amends for all your sins! Gennaro... First, you must provide for the children of poor Mr. Magliocco. -Yes. -Second, you must give a huge amount of money to the needy parish. -Yes. -Third, you must help me buy a plot from a Chinese guy. -Yes. -Fourth, you must never swindle people with the lottery and get rid of the professor. And you must stop producing that awful Mamma Oil that's bad for the stomach. -Okay. -Promise and swear all of this. -And with a notary. -Yes. So I absolve you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. -I don't want to die. -Who told you you have to die? Pray to Saint Gennaro for grace. Soon it'll be his celebration, too! Saint Gennaro performed a miracle! He gave back to us, more lively than before, our benefactor! Don Gennaro! We're all happy to see him still standing! I'm in a wheelchair. And our Saint Cabrini didn't want to be second to Saint Gennaro. Look at what she gave us! After a lot of years, she has managed to reunite in this church my brother Alberto and his friends. And we also have Commander De Felice of Bank of America, and Engineer LoBello, who will both finance and build the project of our sports field! Honestly, thank you, from the bottom of my heart! -You're Father Salvatore Anastasia. -Yes, sir, that's me. And you are...? I'm Frank Costello, the head of the Italian Community. I'm glad to shake your hand. Allow me to give you my offer for your sports field. I'm sure all the members of the community will follow my lead. Thank you, you're very kind. Thank you very much. And now, my faithful... Let's all sing, "We're the Musketeers"! We are the Musketeers of Christ And his house we want to renew Now, brother, join us Saint Cabrini shall help us We are the Musketeers of Christ... You did well when you followed my advice. And you didn't go after Don Gennaro. Because of your brother. Oh, sure. Yes. Everyone is looking at us. It's a delicate moment. Very delicate. We are American citizens... Read it. And have the friends read it, too. Do we have to give all this cash to this priest? We had to, yes. Well... We had to. Big Al told us that the more we keep his brother priest busy with the sports center he wants to build, the less he'll be a pain in the ass for our business, which he knows nothing of. We are American citizens But Italian within our hearts We are the Musketeers... Yes, here, here... Here I am, my sons. I'm here. I'm here. You sinners. Form a line. Praised be the Lord. Now and forever. LATEST NEWS ALBERT ANASTASIA Tell me, my daughter. How long since your last confession? Yes. I repent... Father? Father Salvatore? Father Salvatore? Father? -Oh, Holy Mary, what happened? -He fainted! -He's sick! -Let's call for help! THE ALLEGED MURDER INC. BOSS SUMMONED BY THE KEFAUVER COMMISSION Call someone! America is a tough country. If you can't defend yourself, it squashes you. In front of the Senate committee, which is investigating organized crime in our country, we'll see the alleged bosses of the lottery racket, organized prostitution, drug trafficking and gang murders. We say "alleged" because constitutionally every citizen is innocent until proven guilty. Alleged, Salvatore. Alleged. Even the TV says that. Do you understand? No, lay down, please. "Alberto Anastasia, the alleged boss." Of Murder Inc. -Oh, do I have to explain it to you? -No. What do you want to explain? -Did you know it, Father Michele? -What? What they say about my brother. -It might be just some gossip. -No. It's no gossip. Now I understand why he insisted for me to stay here to help you. Big Al's brother, a name that frightens. It was useful to you. -How dare you? -What about the people? As long as I say, "I'm Father Salvatore Anastasia," they open all their doors. Silly me, I was thinking I was getting everything with my sympathy, my personality, my charm, my words... And the kids? "I want to take them off the streets," I said. "The street is a bad teacher." Isn't that true? Don't you think that many who will meet that commission, had they met someone who took them off the street when they were kids-- No. No, Father Michele. I don't believe in anything anymore. I'm only ashamed. I don't have the force to show myself in public. A lot of people-- Good, honest people. -And they are afraid of me? -Salvatore... I understand your feelings, and I don't want to justify anyone. But you haven't figured out America at all. The good, honest people you're talking about, respect and admire men like your brother. To them, they're the symbol of success. They feel avenged of every humiliation they had to endure. You just now got to America. Do you know how Italians used to live here 30, 40, 50 years ago? They were considered worse than Negroes. They were thrown out of churches because they were poor and in disarray. They were called "dago," "guinea." That is, dogs, pigs. Why do you think they made Mother Cabrini a Saint? We Italian priests couldn't get into hospitals nor prisons. Not even to assist those sentenced to death! This doesn't justify becoming a criminal. No, no, no, it doesn't justify it. It explains it, in a country where violence is in nature as well as in men. -Try to understand-- -What? I only understand I want to leave. I want to go back home. All right, go back to Tropea, to the seminary. That's where you belong! Without any problems nor responsibilities. Here we need men who are ballsy! That's why we wear pants and not petticoats! Do you believe you've always respected the Constitution -and the laws of this country? -I believe so. Have you ever fought in a war for our country? -No. -What did you do for this country? I don't understand the question. If you look back when you became an American citizen, can you tell us anything to your credit? I've paid my taxes. You're accusing me, before millions of Americans, of crimes you cannot prove. And you won't let me demonstrate how your accusations are unfounded! This is not how you treat a human being! This commission has declared I've used "gangster methods" in my legitimate business. To develop them, to avoid competition, and to cover fiscal frauds. These accusations, and these insinuations, are an attempt to get proof to use against me. Would you like some coffee, Father? I will never incriminate myself. -No way, no how! -I've always worked honestly. Everything I've said or done, I've said or done out in the open. When I was a child, I lived in New Orleans. I couldn't go to a school for white people. No, no. We Calabrians have a skin that's too dark. Believe you me, in America, having a name that ends with a vowel is bad for business! This hearing is adjourned until tomorrow. We'll resume interrogating Alberto Anastasia. The Kefauver Circus goes on. Once the show will be over, everything will be the same. Because crime, corruption and vices can't be eradicated by a Senate investigation, but with a policy of social reforms to remove forever poverty, ignorance and discrimination. -Move, move. -No pictures. Go, move! You may be seated. -Are you Alberto Anastasia? -Yes. Do you admit that you came to the United States clandestinely? Yes. I did in 1916. That didn't stop me from being a soldier in the last war, and to earn a medal. Anastasia, do you admit that you've been arrested and convicted under a false name? Yes, they did convict me. Only because I had a knife in my pocket. Probably I was the only one back then. Back then, my job was at the Brooklyn Harbor, where everyone had a fly swatter in their pockets. Do you admit that you've organized gangs of workers at the Brooklyn Harbor? They were not gangs, senator. It was a union. Unless you think it's a crime to defend the rights of the workers. -You used violence to impose the union. -Of course! The companies had the workers beaten up by criminal gangs, who destroyed the offices of our union. What were we supposed to do? Sing some Psalms? You're accusing me of being responsible for ordering hundreds of murders. How come the police have never been able to find one shred of proof against me? I know what you're thinking. That I've corrupted both the police and the courts. Don't you understand that, if you maintain that, that you destroy the trust the citizens must have in justice! You force them to think that, if they want justice, they have to take it themselves! Think twice on what you're doing. I love this country. As I love the one where I was born. Here I've worked and raised my kids. And my judges are the 40,000 workers of the Brooklyn Harbor, who today live as men, and not as slaves. Only they have the right to accuse me or to acquit me. TWIST AT THE KEFAUVER COMMISSION THEY CAN'T INCRIMINATE ANASTASIA DUE TO LACK OF EVIDENCE HOWEVER, ALBERTO ANASTASIA IS SENTENCED TO 10 MONTHS IN PRISON FOR TAX EVASION It's been five months since that horrible day when I saw my brother Alberto handcuffed. Now he's locked up in the bleak jail of Sing Sing. And I managed to finally obtain permission to visit him. I hadn't spoken to him since the day the investigation started. I must confess that, since then, I've been afraid to meet him. Of course, deep down, I'm sure of his innocence. But maybe I think that because I'm his brother, and it'd be horrible, looking him in the eyes, to read the confirmation of those dreadful things he's been accused of. While I was waiting for him, I wanted to ask him a thousand questions. I wanted to know the truth of his words. But when I saw him in front of me, so humiliated in his convict's garb... Poor Antonio... I was shocked. I felt a lump in my throat, and I didn't have any strength to speak. Toruzzo, I know you want to know the truth from me. But even if I swear I'm innocent, you can always think I'm telling you this because you're my brother, and I don't want you to suffer. Luckily, you saw the investigation. And you heard with your own ears they don't have any proof against me. Sure, I could have refused to answer, like the others did. Instead I wanted to talk. To accuse them. And they haven't forgiven me for that. So, all I've done at the New York Port-- the union, my fights for the workers-- everything is forgotten, nullified. Today, I'm not good for anything. Father, Father! They are dismantling the organ. -Look! They're taking it away. -No! Ah, good. They came. That was an older model. Don't you worry. I had asked them to take it away. I want to get a better one. Alas, what Peppinello is saying is true. They're taking the organ away, and I'm forced with my kids to tell some innocent lies to hide the truth from them. All my work, years in the making, has been destroyed in a few days, and our parish is in conditions of absolute indigence. We're back like we were before. No. Even worse. Everyone has abandoned me. My attempts fail one by one, miserably, and I suffer one humiliation after another. Don Gennaro says he's not in, even when I can see him. Engineer LoBello and Commander De Felice never answer the phone. The Chinese guy... Not only does he refuse to give me his plot, but he does so in a way that's disrespectful and violent. I understand the why of all this, and I don't know what to do. Even if now, as Father Michele says, I wear pants instead of a petticoat, I lack the strength and the courage to react. This is for you, Frank! NEW FIGHT AMONG THE BOSSES OF THE UNDERWORLD. WHO TRIED TO KILL FRANK COSTELLO? THE MOST LIKELY SUSPECT IS ALBERTO ANASTASIA... Extra! Extra! Read all about it. Alberto Anastasia still in jail. Suspected of ordering the shooting of Frank Costello. Extra! Extra! Read all about it. Thanks, Father. Extra! Extra! Read all about it. Alberto Anastasia still in jail. -Read, Father Michele, here. -It was expected. What was expected? It's always been like that. It's in the nature of things. The head of a big organization must accept its risks, too. What's Alberto got to do with this? Why are they accusing only him? Police and journalists don't understand a single thing. This is not a failed murder. Can you imagine a professional killer, three feet away, missing a target like old Frank? No... This was a warning. "My friend, you're done. Leave your spot to someone else." This someone else would be Alberto? Father Salvatore, they're bringing back the organ! The organ? Did they bring it back? It's impossible. -Are you surprised? -Of course I am! What is... Oh, good. Not here, but in the church. Upstairs, by the way. -Who sent it? -Father Salvatore! -Who's this guy? -Dear and precious! Oh, yeah. Blessed is he who sees you. This morning I was saying to our friend De Felice, "Whatever has happened to Father Salvatore?" Same question I asked myself yesterday, during the bank board meeting. Everyone was asking, "Does Father Salvatore Anastasia want this nice mortgage or not?" Sure, we want it. -We do want it! -My dear Father Salvatore! -It's been too long! -He's coming, too? I wanted to come visit you. You never pass by my office. -I want to kiss your holy hands. -No! -Yes, hello? -What? -Are you mad at me? -Are you asking me that? -Yes! Who's that? -Come, come. -Who is it? -Sonny Boy wants to tell you something. -Hello? -I'll offer all them a drink. It's your moment. The fear has returned. We need those famous balls, Salvatore! Please, gentlemen, come with me. Hello, Sonny Boy, tell me. Alberto? They released him this morning? I'm coming! This is the Italian channel of Brooklyn Television, New York. We're broadcasting live out of Sing Sing penitentiary where Alberto Anastasia has been released after time served due to tax fraud. As you remember, Anastasia, besides being accused by the Kefauver Commission, has been suspected of being the likely instigator of the assassination attempt on Frank Costello. -Can you give us something? -No comment. -What are your plans? -Get out. Get out. Move. I'm not saying anything. -You must have a statement. -Scram. Move. You? You can't ignore the press. -I'm happy to see you. -Brother! Say something for the press. -How are things? -Splendid, Alberto. The only one who's still resisting me is that damned Chinese guy. I don't know how to handle him: the easy way or the hard way. Salvatore, take it easy. Don't sweat it. Actually, I have to talk to you. Quite seriously. Glad to see you again, Don Alberto. -My dear Alberto. At last! -Oh, Tony. -Hi. -Here he is, our Alberto. -How is Maria? -Today she's better. Everyone else is upstairs waiting for you. Tell them I'll be up in a minute. I want to talk to Salvatore. -Come, Toruzzo. Let's drink something. -Yes. We'll celebrate your coming back and my big successes. I assure you, Alberto. If things keep going like this, -I'll reform all of Little Italy! Yes. -Take it easy. Wait. -You've done a lot already. -A lot, you say? I still have to start! -Now the fun begins! -Toruzzo, you've had a good time. Now you have to go back home. I can't be your nanny anymore. Mom and Carmelina want you. They need you! Listen, my dear Alberto... I don't need you as a nanny since I'm a grown man. If I may, maybe I know America even better than you. Mom and Carmelina don't need me. They're self-sufficient. And if you think I'll go back to Tropea, you've got the wrong idea! I must stay here, in New York! Father Michele is old. He wants to go back to Venice. I've asked the bishop, and he gave me his authorization. And I said, "That's all right!" There was a deal. We had an agreement. -What agreement? -What? When I invited you here to America, it was just to get to know each other. Now we know each other, and you go back home. Oh, that was our agreement? So this pact, my dear Alberto, is still valid. Because we still don't know each other. You don't know me, nor do I know you. Therefore, let's take one step at a time. And you'll see amazing things. I promise you! Because I figured out how you live here in America. Nothing shocks me anymore. I've even figured out what method you must use to convince people. You don't want to listen to me the easy way? I'll use the hard way, then. Shall we give it a go? Fine! If you challenge me, I can show you what I've got. I can't get anything with a smile, but I can make an ugly face too. What do I need? I know how to do it. There. The collar up. The evil eyes. A big hat on my head. And a big cigar in my mouth. And voila. You're all set. It's a miracle! Thanks for coming here. Chinaman, are you hiding from me? Chu Chin Chu. Maybe you won't need this ear, anymore? -I was waiting for you, Father. -Really? Good. So, Chinaman, are you gonna give me this plot, or else? It's yours already, Father. -Tell me what to do. -It's very simple. In a week, I want it cleaned like the palm of my hand. Understood? Understood. Like your white hand, Father. Son and Holy Spirit. YOUNG ITALY SPORTS CENTER Guys, the littlest ones there, on the bench. And listen to me: This is a sports field, not a battlefield. Soccer is an elegant game. Let's go. All in the middle. Remember: In Italy, we have fun playing with that ball. Don't jump on each other! Pay attention to my whistle! Oh, Saint Crispin! I told you not to jump on each other! Don't jump on each other! Hey, kids! Have you seen Father Salvatore? -Over there! -Under that human pile! No! You can't do that! My dear boys, I have to explain to you again what soccer is! Father. Father Salvatore. -What now? -The uniforms have arrived. Father Salvatore, we've got the uniforms! What are you doing? What's this? What is all of this stuff? Who are you? Who ordered these? Father Salvatore, this is a gift from your brother Alberto. My brother? -Hello? -Hello. This is Salvatore. Is Alberto there? Oh, it's you, Salvatore. No, Alberto isn't home. I wanted to talk to him because we've got some big boxes, and my boys went crazy. There should have been soccer uniforms inside. He sent me soldier uniforms. Diver uniforms. Medieval warrior uniforms. Police helmets. Balls as big as watermelons. Do you see what he did? Listen, Maria... Where can I find Alberto? He's at the Sheraton Hotel barbershop. Would you like the number? No, no, no. I don't need it. Definitely. He's my barber, too. Thanks, Maria. See you soon. -Now, you get these pictures out of... -Yeah, yeah. That's enough, boys. Now be careful. Aim down. Hello, barbershop at Sheraton Hotel? This is Father Salvatore. Is my brother, Alberto Anastasia there? No. Hello? Hello? Hello? My dear Toruzzo, I'm sending you these uniforms for the kids, so that they won't play in the streets anymore. Forgive me for what I told you the last time we saw each other. I think a lot about you. You know what? I feel a bit homesick. I'd like to come back to our village. Maybe with you. You were his bodyguard. -What do you mean? -How come... you weren't here when they killed him? Me? Me? I went to the drugstore for a cup of coffee. I haven't done anything. Don Alberto gave me permission to go. -How come? -How come? Captain, Mr. Grosso can say that. Yes. It's true. And who are you? I'm a priest. Subtitles Translated by: Matteo Molinari
