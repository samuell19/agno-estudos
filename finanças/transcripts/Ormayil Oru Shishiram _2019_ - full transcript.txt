Which is that incarnation? This deity, invoked with all the fury of incarnations, Has been named now as Narasimham. Look there! (chants going on) He went to the theatre by himself! Still a baby, but he wants to watch the movie. Get inside! Missing his school, you idiot. Get inside, such an arrogant boy! I was not worried about getting beaten. Watching Lalettan's movie Narashimham the very first day, first show in the theatre gives a great pleasure! So, that’s your love story. Still Ram, it’s been 7 years after that, right? These days, after a break-up, maximum 2 to 6 months, Then people forget it and get new relationships. 99% of boys, But you are quite different. Saira, what you said is true. But some moments in life, Whether good or bad, It will take some time to fade from our memories. A longer time. Cut it! Very good, Aswin! Very good. Ok, let’s take a break. It’s after the break, right? Hi, let’s sit over there. I read the whole script. It’s good. Thank you, sir. I am happy about one of my assistants making a movie independently. But you should be brave enough for that. I saw that bravery in this script. I feel tensed as it is my first movie. You should feel tensed. Not just for the first movie, For all the movies you make, you should feel tensed. Because, film making is a serious profession. Do you know what are the most important factors in a film maker’s life? Confidence, hard work and luck. The first two are depending on us. And the third on God. Then, there is a producer behind you, who invests crores believing in you. I understand Sir. I am not in a hurry. I will start the shoot only after proper planning of the pre-production. Very good. How’s the work going on? The music work is going on now. Who’s doing the music? A newcomer named Ranjan. He had done the music for Joseph. Most of the people are newcomers. That’s good. New people, new thoughts… This will be excellent, I am sure. So, all the very best. - Thank you, sir. - Ok. Move this aside. - Good morning, Sir. - Good morning. Where is the producer? - He’s not reached yet? - He’s on the way. Where have you been? I had told you that I would pick you. And you said you had some urgent work. I went to meet Jithu sir. Oh, that’s nice. Good morning. Hi Nithin, Come. - Hi Ranjan, - Hi. What’s the confusion about singer? The song is nice. But we are confused whether we should try a new voice. Because our risk will be reduced, if it’s an experienced singer. Better than an old usual voice, A fresh voice is better than an old and over-used voice, Overall there would be a freshness. That’s right. If so, there is a voice that I have filtered from the mails I received. - You please listen to that. - Ok. "Somebody is gently caressing my heart" Who is the singer? One Varsha from Cochin. What happened? Do you know her? Hey! Do you like rain? You got anything to tell me? Hey, Hey dude, she is not the only one in this world with the name Varsha. It is not her. It’s her dude. "An Autumn in Memories" Subeesh! What’s it? Got it. I have printed it, take it. Here! A+, B+, C, D… For you? C, D, C… I only have these. (Screaming) I will kill you. Where can you get admission with these marks? I don’t know. Dad, I can get for Humanities easily. What? Humanities? After that what will you do? Dear, he wants to make movies after 12th grade. What? Movie making? And then roam around jobless. You must study computer science for 12th grade. I will arrange for your engineering admission. Do you understand? Mom! Humanities…. Useless…. What are you doing, dear? What’s the problem? If you put all the manure together for that coconut tree, Won’t it wither away? It won’t wither. I have been doing coconut business for 10 years. I know how much manure I should put. Stop all your games after this week. I have arranged your admission to Thokkanangadi School for 12th grade, for computer science. Study well and become an engineer. Do you hear me? What are you saying? Teacher! What’s this Varsha? Is it how you come to a classroom? You are all wet, Go outside. You may come inside after drying your clothes. All of you note down the derivation of the problem written on the board Do you like rain? What? You are all wet. I… I just got wet. It’s fun to get wet in the rain. Any amount of rain is not enough for me. What’s your name? Nithin Mohan. What’s your name? Varsha. Oh, Varsha. Hello, sit here. What’s your name? Nithin. I’m Jithin. I will be back in a moment. - Are you studious? - No. Dude, you know the guys sitting on the first two rows, Are very studious. Our lives will be wasted if we sit them. Let’s do one thing, Let’s sit in the back. Come on dude. Look at these two guys. Move man! Sorry. Riyas, Nithin, This is Robin. He wants to be a priest after 12th grade. - Let’s wait and see. - Dude. Nothing like that. If I’m not spoilt after 12th grade, then I might try to become a priest. Just that. This is Abhi. - Hi - Hello. What happened to your arm? I fell off the bicycle. When the school opened, he had plaster on his leg, And now it’s on his arm. So, we have given him a name, Odiyan. Riyas, if you tell my name to everyone, I will also give you a weird name and tell everyone about it. You can do that, I don’t care. Can’t you stop that yet? To woo girls? Leave it. You may woo any girl, Did you see that girl? Who? With a white hijab. Don’t try to woo her, ok? - Why so? - She is for me. - What’s her name? - Rehna. She looks very proud. That I will manage. Then it’s fine. (humming a song) Here! Dear bro, I asked you to stitch boot cut trousers, This looks like a tube. Yesterday your father had come after you left. Do you know what he said? No need to make it fashionable. Just to stitch it in the usual way. What can I do? I had enough of my dad. Shall I bring a new cloth? Will you stitch boot cut trousers? I can do it. But will your father let you? I don’t think so. He won’t let you. I won’t tell my dad about it. Then it’s fine. I will take this one. You take it. I had told you not to put all the manure together. Mistakes happens to everyone. The manure is not good enough. Now you are blaming the manure. You may leave. See your father’s coconut tree. What a beautiful sight, isn’t it, Mom? Don’t you have anything to study? Dad, today was my first day in the school. So what? Are you not allowed to study today? Dear, I have kept tea and snacks on the table. Eat it. Go. I will tell you one thing. The children are also like that coconut tree. If you feed them too much, they will also wither away. Do you understand? No, I don’t. You don’t have to. Go and try to get the Best Farmer Award. This man! Dear, you remember that trouser we bought for him last week? He doesn’t like it. He says it’s old fashioned. There’s a new style trouser… - What’s that? - Boot cut. Yes, he says he wants the boot cut trousers. Do you know about fashion? There he starts… Fashion keeps changing through time. This decent dressing, gentle dressing, That remains without change all the time. You will be shocked if you see what people do in the name of fashion. This boot cut, short cut, what else, with long side-whiskers, growing long hair like the guy in Anniyan movie, What are you thinking? There is a small black and white photo inside my suitcase. The guy in that photo looks around 20 years old. He has a nest-like hairstyle, with a moustache which goes like this below the lips, the side-whiskers and a bulgan beard, He’s wearing a chequered shirt with long collars, And a belt, you should see that belt, And the trousers with flare of 30 cm. Enough of your blabbering, bring the chutney. That I will bring. Who’s that crazy guy, mom? Don’t call him crazy, dear son. He’s your close acquaintance. Now, isn’t the boot cut fine for you? Ok, ok. Don’t you agree? Dad has agreed, I will give you the money for stitching boot cut. Hi Latha sister, Hi Jalaja, didn’t see you for a long time. Don’t you come to the temple these days? Goddess is most important to us. Now Varsha has got a lot to study. She is in 11th grade. - Varsha got full A+ in 10th grade, right? - Yes. She used to study in Pushkaran’s tuition centre, didn’t she? That we sent her just for a confidence. Now, the school requested us to admit her in the 11th grade. She would become a great doctor in future, won’t she? No, she is not interested in that. She wants to become a Scientist, In rocket science. Like our President Kalam. Pushkaran Sir says she’s smart enough to become the President of India. You know Pushkaran Sir? Hey, the temple will close soon. Ok then. Bye sister. Will tell you the rest when we meet for the Ayalkootam meeting. Bye. Hope the temple is not closed. If you shut your mouth, we can pray before it is closed. He won’t even let me talk to anyone. What a behaviour! She started in the morning itself. Varsha, I am telling you, One day I will throw everything away. She’s doing this during study time. I don’t care. You wait and see, A fish lover…. - Dear, - What? Children would have some craze for these things. - So what? - We should encourage them. Dad, Mom would be happy if I keep studying for 24 hours. Your Mom boasts to people that you will become the President of India. Oh god! Ok, now all the blame is on me. There comes a dad and daughter. - Dear, - Yes. Sunny had told me that some new breeds of fish are available in the town. Really? Should I buy them, or will you go? No need dad, I will go and buy on Saturday or Sunday. That’s better. Then, look here. Don’t tell mom that I’m going there. You know her behaviour. Oh, if she comes to know about it, she would start fighting. Yesterday we studied about vaporisation. Today we will discuss about the topic boiling point. I had asked you to study yesterday’s part. Hey! So, what is vaporisation? I don’t know. Rajesh? You answer me. Dude, he is trapped. Sir, I didn’t study. You don’t know. Who is sitting with head down? What’s your name? Nithin. Ok, Nithin answer me. What is va…..? I asked him. Let him answer it. Don’t be over smart. What is vaporisation? Tell me. You don’t know. Then you say the answer, Dude, say you don’t know. …which an element is converted from a solid or liquid to a gas is called vaporisation. Correct, very good. Both of you deserve a cane treatment. Say you were absent in last class Rajesh, show your hand, Stretch your hand! Jesus! Should I tell you again? Stretch your hand! Sir, Nithin was not present in the last class. He joined this Monday only. - Is it? - Yes. You could have told me that? Before you come for the next class, Learn `what is vaporisation`. Everyone, take your text books, And go to the chapter boiling point, page number 43. Thanks. Hey Odiya! Isn’t it time for you to put the next plaster? We, friends may call him by many names. But you don’t call him like that. Now you called him like that. If you repeat it, You will also get a crazy name, And we will make it famous in this college. By putting posters everywhere, ok? I shouldn’t have called like that. Do you care about me that much? If one of us have an issue, that’s for all of us, isn’t it? Come on give hand "They gave me their hearts" "And stood by me" "They are coming smartly" "These friends are like my heart beat" "They come, giving me life" "They can bring mountains tied with rope" "Stand with me strongly" "They can demolish bastions of forts like an egg" "After the battle, if we stand together" "Then it is celebration" Principal...Principal!

Dude, you’ve been wooing that Varsha for a long time. Will anything work out? There he starts again with his wooing. Dude, she’s one of the smartest girls in the class, And keeping good company with us. That’s it. Dude, but seeing the expressions that you have on your face when you see her, We don’t feel like that. Dude Nithin, what he is saying is true? There is nothing like that. He’s just joking. What is not there? Nothing is there. Still, isn’t there a little bit… That… See, this Riyas won’t say anything thoughtlessly. Something is there. I don’t know if it’s love. But something…. Something? I don’t know. You don’t know. To understand that, you should have love within you. I already have that. For you to understand that, - I will do a memory test, - What’s that? Close your eyes. Close your eyes, dude. Believe me. Can’t I open? No, you can’t. Now, fill your mind with her face. Yes, I did. Dear, when you want her to look at you, she looks. Then, do you feel a fire ball going up from your stomach to your chest? Yes, I do. Do you feel like talking to her all the time? Yes, I do, I do. That’s enough. Now you can open your eyes. Do you understand your feelings for her now? You are in love with her, Go and tell her before it cools down. If you were this smart, why didn’t you tell Resna about your love? Not Resna, it’s Rehna. Why didn’t you tell Rehna? I will tell her. When my love for her fills my heart, I will tell her. Rehna, my sweetheart, I’m coming for you. Come! Feels like a festival is going on. Go man! He will set everything today. Hey, do you put cardamom in dumplings? You know these dumplings? That… If you don’t know, it’s fine. I will ask someone else. It’s ok. Juniors! Hello Juniors! What’s up? Why are they here? It’s fun to wash hands in a crowd. Dude Nithin, be careful. He has an eye on Varsha. That’s sure Look there. Varsha, did you come to wash your hand? Have you finished eating? You have a nice lunch box, with clips. Mine is a round one. I have to hit it on the wall to open. This one is easy to open. Varshu, didn’t you go to temple today? Varshu? Yes. Varshu. Varsha. That sounds great. Varshu!!!! - War shoe? - Hell… I will buy you a pen for the Onam Exam. A pen worshipped in the temple for seven days. Then your exams will be easy. Then she doesn’t have to write the exams, right? A little bit. God helps those who help themselves. Then, if you have god’s help, You don’t have to study, right? Joke. Where’s he going to? Varsha…. Who are you? Varsha, Sreekala teacher is looking for you. - Go fast. - Come. Are you going? No, she won’t. Bro, they are our classmates. Leave them. You are smart. Come here. Please don’t insult me. What you did is good. This is how classmates should be. Very good. Do you have fever? Your face looks tired. I have a herbal medicine with me. I will bring it in the afternoon. If that guy hadn’t come there, I would have set everything. Else he would be singing romantic songs by now. Get lost man. Dude, listen to me. I have an idea. Shall we give her a letter. Letter? Love letter. That’s a good idea. You can write whatever is in your mind. Are you all studying well? Yes, isn’t it, dude? What man? - Ramani! - Yes. His friends have come. Yes, they came for combine study. So, he has the company of good children now. Don’t go to his room often to disturb them. Let them study. I won’t go. You please deshell this coconut. Let me cook something, I have to feed the children. Move please. Dude. She’s here. - Where is he? - Where did he go? There he comes. It’s very hot. Tell me, did you write? Let me see - Is it Arabic? - Yes. How will she understand it? She knows Arabic very well. She comes first in the madrasa. Even if anyone else see this letter, They won’t understand. I haven’t even written my or her name in this. So, this letter is safe. Then, give this letter to her. - Will give it later. - Go man! Although I prepared well for the exam, I still have some tension Tell her! Hey! What? I like you Rehna, I love you. What’s this? Love letter? Riyas, I am already in a relationship. Not just that, we don’t make a good pair. People will laugh at us if they hear about our love. All the boys have this kind of sickness towards beautiful girls. Aren’t you ashamed to say that to me? Don’t you have any common sense? Riyas, you don’t worry. Find a girl who matches you and love her. Come dear. I will start laughing if stand here any more You shouldn’t have said like that. He deserves more! Hey! Do you see your face in the mirror? Do you? Who do you think you are? Rani Mukherji or Aishwarya Rai? Kavya Madhavan or Navya Nair? There are many beautiful girls in this school. But this stupid guy loves only you. If you like him, say yes, if not say no. Don’t try to boss. We, boys are not fools. Come dude. Let’s go. Didn’t you have enough? His Arabic…. Dude… I like that boy. Super dialogue. What he said is true. There are some people here also who deserve this kind of dialogue. Will she report it to the Principal? No, she won’t. I have stopped her from that. Even if she does, it’s a shame for herself. Next time when I come to school, - I want to meet Nithin. - Ok. Haven’t you finished eating? Go and study. There she starts again. This is not proper. She is a big girl now. When she talks about romance, Why are you encouraging her? Shouldn’t you stop her from interfering in that? Not just mothers, fathers should also be cautious about grown up daughters. One incident happened in the classroom. How many children of her age would share this with their parents? When a girl is confident enough to share everything to her parents, She would never be spoilt. I know my daughter very well. Fine, fine. - Hello - Tell me dude. There’s nothing to worry as we thought. I thought Rehna would complain about us. Dude, it’s Varsha who stopped her. She had told me in school itself that it won’t be an issue. That’s great. Anyways, I lost my love. Let’s do one thing, let’s set your love. You come fast. Over, over. Ok dude, over. CID Naseer… What? I was saying that the movie CID Naseer is there in Asianet channel, this morning at 10. Dude, most of the famous people in this world have failed many times. - Don’t you know? - For 12th grade? Riyas, My dear Odiyan… Riyas, Please call him. - Me? - One minute. What’s the matter? It’s there, not here. - What? - Let’s go there. What’s it, man? Hey, would he have given any Arabic letter to her? Looks like it’s Urdu. Will it be the question paper for our next exam? There is a chance for that. What’s that? What dude? - She says she likes me. - What’s it? - Arabic? - Yes. Then what did you tell her? That I also like her. Sunny dear, (singing movie song) Dude Princi.. No dude, it’s Tiger Chacko. Do you think it is right for only you to sing and have fun? Like the boys, girls also have the right to sing and enjoy. Boys have done their performance. Now, who among you is going to sing a beautiful song? Varsha sings well. Ok, please sing for us. -Sing well, okay - Okay "Somebody is gently caressing my heart" "Is it the breeze, rain or sunlight" "Resting under the “Vaaka” tree?" "Unable to speak out, sweet honey rains endlessly in my heart" "Unknowingly, I hear at the door of my soul" "A footstep regularly" "Is it a dream, is it a story" "Or just a feeling" "Did love bloom?" "I did not know anything" Very good Our school youth festival will be conducted on 16th of this month. One of the main events will be Varsha’s song. Thank you, sir. -It was nice. - Thanks All the best for your exams Thank you, sir. What’s his problem? Check quickly dude. I don’t see anyone. Better if they don’t see us. Would she have gone to temple? What are you doing? Please check secretly. I am not peeking into someone’s bathroom. I came to see my girlfriend. So, I have to stand boldly. You stand like that. Still… where’s she gone…Hey! What are you doing there? Our bicycle is damaged. Whose bicycle? Mine. Go away from here. There he comes to break his bicycle. Let’s go… go… I had told you… Would he chase us? It’s telephone directory, All phone numbers are there inside, Do you know? Her father’s name is Rajendran. We know her house. Can’t we find the number from this easily? Here…. Find it quickly, Do it actively dude. 2 1 9 … Did you find it? One of these eight numbers will be her number… - Shall we call? - Yes. - Call then. - Give me. Dial the number. Shall I? 2347… It’s ringing. Hello, Hello, - Is it Rajendran’s number? - Yes. Working in Water authority? No, I work in Police department. Lightning Rajendran. Hello… Is it Rajendran? Yes, who are you? Do you work in water authority? Yes, I am Rajendran working in Water authority. Who are you? Hello, It’s her father. What… What can I say to him? - Hello - Talk to him, please. Hello, - Hello - Who are you? How long I’ve been saying hello to you? I couldn’t hear properly. Where are you calling from? From the telephone exchange. - Oh… - Can you hear now? Yes, I can hear now. Is it clear? Yes, but not very clear. Yes, that’s the problem everywhere. Do one thing, Just try shaking the telephone body. One second, To shake the body? Did you shake? Yes, I did. - Isn’t the voice clear now? - Let me check. If there’s any problem again, do like this. You are right, it’s clear now. Ok sir, Thank you. - It’s her number, isn’t it? - Go away. It’s simple method. This world is for those who are successful in life. So, we should only think about success all the time. We should keep finding ways to success. For example, take the case of a farm, You plough it, sow the seeds, When they sprout, what do you do? We give manure. We remove the weeds. The saplings are important. This world doesn’t need weeds. So, do you want to be a weed or a sapling? It’s you who has to decide it. I want to be a sapling. Correct! So, you are joining, aren’t you? Of course. - The classes happen on every Sunday. - Ok. Sunday? Yes, Sunday, Are you hearing for the first time? Are you going to be an engineer as your father says? May be my dog. To join the film institute, a degree is necessary. I’m just getting this degree for that. Your case looks funny to me. You, getting a passport and going to Dubai, After doing business for 30-40 years, Will get bedridden with high cholesterol and other illness. You see, I will maintain a fit body doing exercise, Like the movies star Mammooka. Then, after retuning I will produce a movie. Mammooka is fine, but him… Come. Dude Dude, please show me. It’s commerce. Do you want? Miss, paper please. What’s this? Write! Hey, the answer sheet… Thanks! What you are doing is not right. I hadn’t studied anything, that’s why… I don’t see Rehna with you these days, Did you have a fight? Nothing like that. What you said that day was correct. She deserved it. Even if you don’t like a person, one shouldn’t speak like that. Riyas would have been hurt very badly. Anyone would be hurt hearing that. If I tell you the same as what Riyas told, Would you reply me the same way? But Nithin would never tell me like that, We are friends. Aren’t we? It didn’t work, I will get in the next try. Dude, what’s the plan for Onam celebration? Let’s not wear usual traditional dress for Onam. Then? This is a bit different. Different? Different? Different? Beat it! Flowers, Aren’t you doing floral design in your class? Yes, we are. But, shall I tell you the truth? Even though they are doing it there, I like to do it here. It will be there. Shall I keep this flower over here? If you are running out of flowers, We have a lot in our class. I will bring from my class. It would be nice to keep these flowers on the corners. Which flower do you like Varshu? Yellow or red? Let’s fill this design with yellow flowers. Why are you staring like this Sandhya? I will help you. See I am helping… It’s nice. What kind of dress are you wearing? Did you go for the drum concert? Laugh everyone… Stop it! Let’s fill this design with yellow flowers. What happened Sandhya? Ok, leave now. Go, go. Which is your class? I’m your senior, talk respectfully. I am your senior. I just came to help you guys. We don’t need your help, go now. Leave. Get out of our class. Get out. I’m in 12th grade, your senior, Don’t forget that. - Get out. - Go and eat some oil cake and gruel. I will smash you. People laugh at me, you know why? Because I’m different. But I laugh at you. Because you are same, you bloody fools… You fool... God! What is it, the Indian flag? Is it the way to dress for Onam celebration, sir? See his dressing, Okay leave it Anyway, you participate in the programs. Happy Onam sir. Come dude. Nothing. Sir, this is an educational institution. You should have some discipline. Dear Namboodiri Sir, today we are celebrating Onam in this school. We should come out of teacher’s attire today and join our students for the feast and other programs. Shouldn’t we be doing that? Let's also join and dance with them! Dude, we have got a wonderful chance to compensate. Let’s recover from this first. You keep quiet. Tell me the matter. The tug of war competition is taking place in the ground. All teachers and students are there. The students of 12th grade, commerce are leading now. Shall we go and defeat them. Dude, they are seniors, How can we win over them? Dude, I have never participated in such competition before. That’s not a problem. We will take care of them, You just have to stand at the back and pull strongly. Please dude. Still, me… I will buy you 10 porottas and 2 plates of beef curry. Are you ready? Then I’m ready. Pull… pull… Don’t let it go… Pull harder… I will buy you 28 porottas and 10 plates of beef curry… Pull! Robin, what are you staring at? Pull! Dude… pull hard…. We won… we won…. (cheering) This way…. This way… (cheering) Why are you sitting alone? Nothing, it’s difficult to walk around wearing this saree. Are you the only child at your home? Yes, why? Just asked seeing you sitting alone comfortably. Nithin, you have a sister, right? Yes, she is always a trouble to me. Nothing like that. You are lucky to have someone to fight and have fun. I want to thank you for two things. One, for saving me from the beating of Namboodiri Sir. And other one for helping me in the exam hall. You don’t have to thank me for that. I’m like this. I don’t know if I might change tomorrow. You won’t change. I’m sure. 10 days… We will meet after 10 days. Yes, 10 days. - It was nice, isn’t it? - Super. Prithviraj was excellent. I liked the songs. “Oh Great singer, you are the moonlight of my heart” Enough guys! come on. The school will open in one week’s time, It’s really hard, dude. The school will open in three days, right? See how happy he is. Nithin, when are you going to tell her about your love? She is considering me as a good friend now. Why should I cause unnecessary trouble? That’s true. Don’t do foolish things as he did. Why to trouble her giving Arabic letter? Dear Robin…. The saint… Why is it raining now? Come, come. Let’s go. Take that cloth also. Come fast. Nithin, come fast. You came with your dad today, What happened to your bicycle? That got punctured. Are you friends with that Pasu again? I saw you talking. Did you see? Still you didn’t come to save me. I don’t like him at all. He always comes to talk to me, with a dirty smile. Varsha Rajendran has secured more than 90% marks for all subjects in 11th grade. Very good. Thank you, sir. Varsha is smart. If you prepare for entrance exams, you can get admission on merit. Let her decide about that sir. Jithin Xavi. Nithin M. Mom God, my hands and legs are shaking with fear. Why does he come to school? He comes to school and sleep sitting on the back bench, Good for nothing. Let me tell you, He is only good for doing crazy things in the school, Do you know what he and his friends have been doing here in the school? This way, we don’t think he can continue for long. What to do, he is not ashamed of anything. Mom, Hey, what’s happening here? Based on the marks they got for first exam, You are talking to parents about how to improve them, right? But I can’t agree with what you are doing. You are teachers. Your responsibility is to understand the limitations of students And inform the parents about them. I agree with that. But it’s not right to say that in front of everyone. You should talk to them in private. That’s the manners, right? You flattered my daughter a lot. Can you guarantee me that she would become successful in her life in future? How can you predict that Nithin, whom you are criticizing now, Will not be successful in his life? The PTA meeting should not be for demotivating students. Please. Why does the system here never change, sir? How can I change the system alone? That’s true. Already other staffs are complaining that I am supporting students unnecessarily. Anyways, you did excellent job. Dad, this is Nithin. I already know him. Sir, please sign here. I will back in a moment. Uncle, you are great. Shall we leave, dear? Brother, I wanted to whistle when I heard that. What? Just because this is a school. If you think something is wrong, Don’t hesitate to respond. Children grow up seeing us. - In that case, you should visit our house one day.- Why? There is one person there who needs advice. Is it a child? Like a child. Everything will be fine. Come dear. Ok then. Did you see him? Tell dad to be like him. You can also be like her. Come. Dude, the youth festival is a good chance for us to shine. If you have any different idea like the Onam celebration, - Dear Nithin, I am not for it. - Go away. Dude, we should be the heroes like the tug of war contest. Fazi will participate in Oppana dance, as bride. Varsha’s song will be there. I can’t. Then, what shall we do? Don’t make mistake. One more! - Sit like this. - Ready, come on! You fool, in this posture, Ok, like this. Start. - Keep your back straight. - Show me. Not yet. Here, here. Hold. Come on! Ready! (humming music) Stop it, turn it off. Did he come to receive any award? - What? - It’s off. Can I also dance with you? You… - What’s this? - Robin… Dear Award bro, this program is just for 5 minutes. It’ not one-hour program as you think. So, you can’t join us. Leave, you please leave. Leave! I too… Please don’t come back again. Close the door and leave. Just wasting our time… Go fast man! I will rock. - There comes the next idiot. - What? Are you guys practicing secretly? - To the right. - Turn it off. Which song is it? "En Aasai Mythiliye" That’s nice, carry on! Come dude! - You close the door. - Of course, - Who is this guy? - Play the music. Shall I lock the door? Do whatever you like. Ready! One more! Light Music - Chest Number 82 -Dude, like this… - Doesn't look good Like this Dude, when will you get that right? Come, let’s practice. - Yes, let’s practice. - Come. Ready! - Which one? - Sit down. Like thanathana… 1, 2, 3, 4.. (singing) Isn’t that our song? Who else chose that? Come, let’s find. Dude, those guys… Hey! Come on Don’t you have anything else to do? I’m your teacher, god! I am telling you to stop. Kick him! I’m telling… oh god, Dude, that’s Mani. Which? From Aasan colony. Do you dare enough to hit the seniors? If you come here to study, do study. Or your parents will regret. Stop guys! Let me see. Does it hurt a lot? No, it feels very nice. You got hit in front of so many people. It’s a shame in front of everyone. Couldn’t you hit him back? When I was about to hit him, Principal came Or I would have smashed his nose. I didn’t want to make the issue worse, Or I would have hit him badly. You can hit them even now. You can hit them even now. Already we are in trouble. Principal has already warned us. and if we go and hit them again... Only when you hit them inside the school you will have a problem You can hit them while outside. - Outside? - Please don’t say like that. Riyas, you got hit very badly, didn’t you? Why did you have to fight with the seniors? Hey, fights are usual for boys. If we got hit, we also know how to hit them back. But you know only to get hit. First, I have to hit her. - Riyas… - Move! Roaming around with the blue shirt guy. We have to hit back. Get up! We will talk only after hitting them within one week. What is he saying? Come dude! Where? Riyas, Come here. My god… Everything was back on track, Now,hell with his vow. Dude, the pain of getting beaten on one side, Then Rehna’s teasing on other side, I lost control. Let’s do one thing. Let’s change what we said. Is it weather forecast, to change when you like. You guys don’t know about that Mani. He is the brother of Drum Ravi in Aasan colony. If something happens to him, that whole colony will attack us. Drum Ravi? Yes, once he starts hitting, it’s like playing drums. He won’t stop once he starts hitting. That’s how he got the name. Then we can’t handle him directly. How can it happen? Let’s do one thing. Let’s hit him in the dark. You can hit even in the light, then how to hit in the dark? Hitting in dark! Riyas, be practical. I have an idea. It’s slightly different. Difference! Don’t say that word. Stop it, you tell me. We can’t fight face to face. - That’s danger, right? - Yes, danger. But we want to hit him, And save our faces. There’s only one way for that. - Let’s hire some thugs. - Thugs! What are you talking about? Hire which thug? There’s a guy near Subeesh’s workshop. Chenkannu Sabu. So, that’s the matter. You guys can handle this easily. Sabu bro, no one should know that we have done it. Why so? If they know that we have done this, he will dismiss us from the school. Who? The Principal. Tell him to get lost. It is thrilling only when you hit a person telling who and why. Not just that, the person who gets beaten has the right to know the reason. You don’t worry. He won’t tell this even to his own mother. Not only that, his relative… who is that? Drum… Who is that idiot, Shaji? Don’t you know him? He lives in Aasan colony. - Our boys had a fight with him once. - Who? The guy who messed with us in the theatre. That germ… Do one thing, Tell our boys to handle him also along with others. I will take care of that. Did this happen in the fight that day? No, it was when I was catching the ball like…. - How? - Like this… Sabu bro! What’s it? - How about the expense? - What? How much do you charge for this? Friend, do you think I’m that hard-hearted? - Still? - Don’t say anything. Not that Sabu bro… I will do this for my friend. You be bold. Dear, it’s been two days since Riyas talked to me. He is avoiding me whenever I try to talk to him. They might be upset. He said he will talk to us only after hitting Mani. That’s what I’m worried about. Will they get hit again? I am also scared about it. Why are you scared? My concern is about Riyas. Aren’t we all friends? I understand everything. Look there. What happened Mani bro? I fell off the bike. Do you know bike riding? People can fall if they sit in the back. That’s not a big deal. Do you know where it happened? Where? At the colony. - In front of everyone. - Really? Then? Tell us! Hey Mani! What’s up silly boys? Didn’t you have enough? We came to return you everything with interest. Don’t get your body damaged, go home and study. We will study only after making you bedridden. If you don’t understand what I said, You will understand when you get hurt. Who are these people? All are famous goons. Kerosene Faisal, Drum Ravi, Bheeman Anu and Chilanka Stephen. "Eyes are two, eyes are two" "You are one of those two" "I gave you half of my heart," "Keeping aside the other girl" "If the heart is good, no need of a mirror" "To sleep, even a pestle will do for a bed" "We behaved badly, jumped over steps" "And showed cunningness in many ways" Who was that? I won’t let anyone to hurt those, who love me. You were not like this before. Hasn't he still reached down? Record, record. Where is your record book? What? Your record. You haven’t drawn the diagram. No problem, you can draw later. Carry on. Record. Record, record. You tell (screaming) If you touch any one of us again, You will have to appoint a person to take care of you. Do you understand? Come. Excellent. I liked it. They deserve it. Get ready quickly Biju bro, it’s getting late to school Do you have classes today? Although it’s Second Saturday, I have Chemistry Special Class. Special Class! Needlessly fooling the children! Don’t they have any other business? You keep it ready, I will take it in the evening Won’t you pay my money? Will pay you in the evening bro. Hello Hi! Where is your bicycle? Usual Problem! Flat tyre! Aren’t you coming to School today? No. I am travelling to Town to purchase something. Alone? What’s wrong in it? My dad says girls should learn to travel alone. Your dad is fantastic!

Then okay Why have you come here? What is there to buy from here? Come Dear, didn’t see you for a long time!

Father will pay Most favorite thing is to get drenched in rain Favourite hobby is Aquarium and Fish keeping A good scholar… And scores 90% in all subjects. To tell the truth, I can’t understand you There is nothing to understand about it. Do what you wish. My dad has given me full freedom for that. Shall I tell you the truth? I am least interested to pursue Engineering. Only because of my dad’s insistence, I attend this coaching class I am not that studious. Doing something creative is my desire! What do you want to be? Me? I wish to become a Film Director So what? It’s a good ambition Really! Isn’t it bad? Nothing! Go ahead with it! Can’t you tell about your ambition to your dad? I told him many times He won’t listen. No use of telling him. Anyhow, in one way, I am impressed Why? Normally boys won’t reveal anything to Girls,.. I mean in boys’ words, to a studious girl like me, Boys don’t reveal their true ambitions Even if they do, they only say they wish to become Doctors, Engineers etc. But you are totally different, Nithin I like it "The flute of breeze sang about you" "The moon and the star turned into you today" "Whenever I close my eyes" "Your footsteps fill my heart" "All my dreams adorn with colours" "Loving endlessly, we became" "Flower-stamen sticking with dew drops" Look...Look…Look..

Move Dude… So you didn’t reveal yesterday also It was because of her dad Or else you would have! By the time you made her sing, couldn’t you disclose your love?

She hasn’t turned up still now Would her dad have created any problem due to my phone call last night? He might have. May be not, as her dad is not that kind of a person, I don’t think there will be an issue Sit down I will convey You go and arrange the transport I have come to tell you a sad news Varsha who is studying in our class.. Her dad Rajendran passed away this morning.

I have respect for you in one thing The risk that you have taken now, I don’t think I would’ve taken it at your age Let me tell you one more thing In this World, compared to the people who expressed their love, People who loved without expressing, are more in number! “The pollen-less lips of flowers” “Keep falling by itself” “And the tormented pigeon” “Thinking of the approaching season again, sings” “In the tune of melting soul” “Surrounded by lonely silence” “Listening for the rain” “When the sky covered by summer becomes silent” “When each moist cloud flies away” Where had you gone?

Get up and come.. Eat something Mom I was a little arrogant that my son never conceals anything from me But now..I am not sure... Son…I’m not here to hit you or scold you What you said was right.. You will feel happy only when you do what you like Only then you will succeed. Some people would take time to realize certain things. Your dad also needed it Your desire is Cinema You might win, Sometimes you might lose. Even if you lose… This dad will always be beside you But in case if your dad is not alive then…. Who else is there for your mom and sister other than you? That’s the reason I advise you To pursue a degree Not an Engineering degree as I desired Anything of your choice! Come. Tell me.. Do you want to see her again? Tell me.. But hereafter don’t go alone I shall also come along with you I will talk to them Before that, You got to decide three things One – She is a fatherless child Two – The distance between both of you Three – What Confidence can you give her about your future at this age of 16! Now the choice is yours! I will be with you Your dad will be with you "Unable to speak out, sweet honey rains endlessly in my heart" "Unknowingly, I hear at the door of my soul" "A footstep regularly" Don’t worry, son If she is destined for you, you will definitely get her Such infatuations happening at this age are for good Only then we can succeed in life You ought to win Even if you decide to lose This dad will not let that happen, Son! Isn’t it Okay? Varsha, once more One, two, three, four… "When each moon which embraces the eyelashes, vanish" "You didn’t come in search of the pearl in dream’s casket" Varsha, very good Only the last stanza is left. Let’s take a break Varsha, let’s take a small break Shall we go for a puff? No, you guys carry on Okay Hi Juniors! Pasu! Come. You are shocked, aren’t you? I know. That is why I told her to give you a surprise Are you thinking about how this happened? Sit here.. Isn’t that what you are thinking now? The thing is…in our School days, although we develop infatuations with many girls But only towards one person, a true feeling will emerge Say…a divine love.. ..a kind of fire… I too felt the same towards Varsha, I swear As my image was too bad in the School She totally ignored me After she left the School and moved to another place I had an urge To see her.. Then I searched for her address and contacted her uncle I went there and had Tea and snacks and developed friendship with his uncle It was a big struggle. Then I applied for PSC, found a good job And went to her house with my parents to propose And dealt the matter. Now we are settled And living a happy life. Even if there’s a lot of drama, This is our life story Dude Riyaz! You fatso! You bulged after being to Gulf! A little bit. - Is this Ray-ban’s? - No, it’s mine Were you hiding over here? No, I was standing there watching your performance, Performance! Give me also some money, dude Let me also make few movies Movies? Film making is not an easy task You need to be sensible for that! Look at his joke! He still has the humour sense! May be with this humour sense you tricked the Arabs in Gulf! Shall we start? Be seated with dad, Mom will be back now, okay Come dear Let’s listen to mummy’s song. Didn't she find anyone else to marry? Nithin "Is it a dream, is it a story" "Or just a feeling" "Did love bloom" "I did not know anything" Bro! Congratulations, buddy I forgot to wish you inside Your Directorial Debut, isn’t it? I can sense the meaning of your smile Shall I tell you what you thought in your mind? Didn’t you think “This fool has won a lottery” This God… Sometimes play some games with humans Whatever we wish for, God will keep it at a distance from us And when we strive and reach nearby, God will keep it little farther. And keep repeating same game. You know why? To boost one’s vigor Your achievement in film making and my marriage with Varsha Pertains solely to the results of our endeavors! English people call it as Effort It’s the Effort that creates Miracles, dude! What happened? No one taught you about this? Riyaz is in a good set up now. Take that off from your ear Or by the time Shoot gets over, Your ears will be blown away - Hello.. - What is the matter? I’m not talking to you, yeah one minute Tell me..I am in Kochi now Shall we move, dear? Let’s go and bring the Car Dude! We must meet again You owe a treat, friend See you Though there is no point in telling now.. It is needless of course! Still I’m curious to know Why did you wish to meet me before leaving? “To listen to the whispering played on the veena of silence” “Are you not there in the shore of some moonlight” “The cooing of koels on the mango branches” “Mingle with your cool words secretly” “Don’t you see my mind?” In this World, compared to the people who expressed their love, People who loved without expressing, are more in number! “When each moon which embraces the eyelashes, vanish” “You didn’t come in search of the pearl in dream’s casket” "The sun rays are also raining darkness” “The winter days also scorch the body” “I became an unspoken word” “Is it a dream, is it a story” “Or just a feeling” “Did love bloom” “I did not know anything”
