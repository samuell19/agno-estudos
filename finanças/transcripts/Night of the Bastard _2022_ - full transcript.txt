God it's hot out here! I don't get how your brother can stand it. You would if you survived just one Buffalo winter. I'd rather be in the snow. At least there's no snakes. Yeah well, I'd rather face a rattler than a polar bear. You didn't grow up around polar bears! How do you know? Whoa, hang on there little lady. See? She knows her Daddy isn't lying. She's already taking your side. Get used to it. I really don't feel right about not bringing anything to this party. I asked, but Chuck and Michelle insisted. Something about wanting to do this in the baby's honor. He's excited about being an uncle and he really wants us to meet his new desert friends. Do I look okay? As beautiful as ever. I'm so fat right now. You're not fat, you're pregnant. You can blame me for that. I do every day. Perfect. Whoa! I didn't see you there! This is Chuck's house, right? - Yes. - Is he inside? You can go and see. Thanks. Chuck? We're here! Chuck?! I don't see anyone out back. Down the hall. After you. What's going on? Wait right here. My god, Michelle, are you okay? Lily! Stay here. You don't want to see this. From now on, she'll be with Orobas. Move, bitch! Tonight the unholy deity has delivered us the gift of a perfect sacrifice. We are not only granted with the flesh of this family, but also with the purity of the unborn. From blood we arrive, and from blood we depart. Her body is now our temple and we shall now bathe in this most gracious offering in honor of the underworld's Great Prince. We do this in name of Orobas, all knowing and exalted ruler of twenty armies, so that He may bring forth his legions and rule back the world that was once his dominion. May this humble blade summon the darkness we so dearly desire. May this baby girl bestow the power of Orobas upon us. Your soul is His now. Pete! Are you seriously trying to give us cancer? Come on, man, that smells horrible. Dude, who cares? Shit! That reminds me of last night. Except it was a much smaller load. Oh... Guys, I don't need to hear the details of your sex life. You'll hear the details later either way. Damn right. I'm keeping my tent far from yours. Aw, you don't wanna join ours tonight, George? The last thing I wanna see is Pete's balls again. Wait, there was a first time? Unfortunately, yes. Please, do tell. When we were on swim team Pete would sit next to you, pull his shorts aside, tell you he sat in gum to make you look. This is private property. It's time to go. What the fuck, man? Why'd you do that? My ears are ringing! That was just a warning shot. You're trespassing. Beat it. We didn't see any signs. There's no fences anywhere. If this is your land then prove it, asshole. Here's your proof. Oh, what you're just gonna shoot us now? Come on, Pete, let's just go. No, fuck this guy! Thinks he can boss everyone around. What? Nothing to say, huh, tough guy? Ow! Fuck you, man! Hey! You can't just go around hitting people, asshole. Who the fuck do you think you are? Yeah, you're fucked, man. My dad's a lawyer, he's gonna sue your hippie ass. I own all this land. And I've had enough of you little punks coming through and trashing the place. Do you think we're the only people on this god forsaken planet?! We didn't do anything! So you just can't just go around blaming people for shit and pointing guns at them. Guys! Shut up! Listen Mister, we'll go. No way! What right does he have-- Pete! Please! Listen man, we're sorry. Don't apologize to this asshole. Get your shit and go! I picked the spot. I thought it was just open desert. We'll pick up our shit and get out of here. Do you want me to kill the fire? Go. Fuck you, man. Pete! C'mon! Please, is there anywhere around here we can camp? Go home. There's too many weirdos out here. Yeah, like you? You desert freak fucking loser. I said get moving. We're bailing man. No worries. Don't come back. Nice to meet ya, you petrified bag of shit! Enough! You have some real anger issues, fuck face. Dude, what the fuck? He's got a fucking gun! What about over there? Too rocky. That's the fourth place you guys have turned down and we're getting further and further from the car. Where do you want to go then? I don't know, George. You tell me. You're the one who told that fucker we'd leave. Yeah, you caved to that asshole so fast. - We could've taken him. - Fuck you both. I'm not about to argue with some trigger happy local. Hold up. What the fuck is that? Shut up for a second! I don't know about this, guys. What in the fuck are they doing? It looks like some new agey Wiccan shit. Whoa, looks like my kind of party! Let's go! Wait, you perv. What do you think, George? I could use a break from lugging this shit around in the dark. Yeah, come on. Let's check out the freak show! Hey guys! We're out here camping tonight too, and wondering if we could maybe join you for a while. What are you doing? Get out of here! Mason. Mason, we shouldn't be so unfriendly to our guests. Come join us. Please. It's okay. We can go. No, no, please. Forgive brother Mason here. He can be quite abrasive at times, but no, he means no harm. Come, have a seat next to our fire. You must be cold. I'm warming up already. So what are you all doing out here? Some sort of nature worship? You could say that. Call it a warm up before the main attraction. Where did you say you were camping tonight? We didn't say. We had a spot over that way but some creep came in and chased us out. He came out with a shot gun. A shotgun? Well, we despise guns. If you're going to kill, do it up close and personal. Or don't do it at all. Don't you agree? Uh, yeah. Sounds reasonable. You guys don't look like you're camping. And why do you say that? Where's your gear? We already have everything we need. Is it just the three of you tonight? Mm, how quaint. A handsome young trio creepy crawling the desert, disturbing not only gun-toting locals but powerful necromancers as well. Yeah. That's, um, us. Yeah. We were kinda hoping you guys had beers. Such worldly intoxicants pale in comparison to the highs we achieve naturally. Breathe in the air, witness the stars aligning. Pete! That's enough for you tonight. Come on, baby. The night's still young. We got plenty of time. Not for you. Swine! Filthy pig! My altar is sacred, not for your pleasures but for the assumption of a deity! What the hell, lady? Relax. You were practically throwing your witchy vag at me a second ago. Like pigs, you gorge on the filth that infects you. I see the mirage of your entitlement. But between your sorry skin and bones rests an empty vessel for the magnificent curios we conjure. What the fuck are you talking about, lady? Are you one of them, the pathetic hoard who waste their lives simply waiting to die? Or are you ready to discover your true purpose? - I asked, are you ready? - Ready for what? Have you ever wanted to be immortal? I don't know. I've never really thought about it. Ready or not, your offering will bring forth the coming of the Great Prince. Man, fuck this shit yo! Let's go. Steady, my brethren. I want to enjoy this euphoric moment. Please let me go. I won't say anything to anyone! There's nothing for you to say. Why are you doing this? Some events are not meant for your kind to understand. Tonight you shall transcend this meaningless realm. You're welcome. Please, I just want to go home! I just want to go... Let me go you fucking psychos! Where's the girl? Fuck! I think I know where she went, Priestess. Hey, little buddy. Bedtime. Marlon, you can't be hungry this late. Ok, just a little bit. Nobody's home! You again! I got deeds to all this land. Go ahead. Sue me. Please! Mister! Please! I need help! Move your foot. I don't care who your son-of-a-bitch boyfriend knows. Get the hell outta here. Please, mister, help me! Don't leave me out here! They tried to kill me! Well you deserved it. Take your business elsewhere. You want me to get my gun again? No! I'll die out here! Please! Please! Just let me use your phone! Are you deaf or crazy? You think I'm falling for this bullshit? Move your foot before I break it off! No! No! For Christ's sake, lady! Oh shit. Please, call the police! They're still out there! You must have really pissed off your fuck faced boyfriends. No, we were attacked! What? By who? By these freaks in the desert! We were looking for another place to camp. They stabbed you? Yes, genius. Here. What am I supposed to do with this? Wrap yourself. It'll slow the bleeding. I don't need this hassle. You gotta get out of here right now. I'm sorry to disturb your perfect fucking evening. Where would you like me to go? You could go anywhere but here. Fine, then at least let me at least use your phone to call the police. I don't have a phone. What do you mean you don't have a phone?! Just what I said. I don't talk to anybody and that's the way I like it. Great. So you're like the last person on this fucking planet who doesn't have a phone? People in jungle shacks have phones and you don't? So where's yours, lady? I lost it while running here! Look man, this is the last place I want to be, but I obviously need a hospital. Alright. There's a clinic about 10 miles up the interstate. I'll take you there. I don't think I can get up. Help me. You have any painkillers or something? No. C'mon on, man. You live all the way out here in the middle of bum fuck and you don't have any drugs?! Yes. I mean no. I hate my life... Drink that. What is this? Does it matter? What the fuck is that? It's mead. - It's wine made from honey-- - I know what mead is. But that's shit mead. It needs some work, I guess. No shit. God, that's strong and disgusting! Fine. No. Wait, give me some more. Whenever you're finished drinking my shitty mead, you gotta get out of here. C'mon. Let's go. Wait. What if they're out there? Do you hear that? That's them. Oh my god! Is that them? What do you think?! What are they doing? I can't see 'em. But we're OK. Doors, windows double locked and barred. We're good. Great. So we're basically trapped in here. You know we're have to get out of here eventually, right? Yeah. No shit. What do they want? I don't know, man. To finish the job? Why the hell did you come here? What else is around here? I didn't know this was your house! Do you know how many of them are there? I don't know, man. Five or six maybe? Did you see any guns? No. They don't have any. Their queen bitch hates them. Hey. Hey, where's your gun? In the shed. What do you mean it's in the shed? Trust me. It's better out there. Better how? Not only are you the last person on Earth without a fucking phone but you also keep your guns in the shed. What kind of home security is that? What the fuck is your problem? I keep it out there so I don't use it on myself in here. If we can hold on for a couple hours maybe they'll scatter in the morning. We got six hours 'till sunrise. Great. I could die by then. - You've made it this far. - And? Like I said, iron bars, metal screens. They ain't getting in here. Are you sure about that? I still need a hospital. Good evening, friends! It seems we've gotten off on the wrong foot. Tell that to the cops! Do as I ask and you can tell them yourselves. What in the hell do you want?! We could start with her first. Time is on our side, and the longer this takes, the worse it will be for you both. Open the door now and we promise to show you mercy. If you don't get off my land right now I'm gonna murder every single one of you! I sincerely doubt that. As you can see, we have you surrounded. Take your boys go get fucked. In due time. But first, let's have some fun, shall we? You have walls and bars to protect you, but we have the advantage. - Let's smoke 'em out. - Patience, Earl. They'll come to us when we need them. Fuck. I changed my mind. You're not gonna last long like that. What can we do? What am I supposed to do with that? You're gonna staple the skin back together and then glue the hell out of it. Are you fucking serious?! I need a doctor! What you need to do is close the wound and stop that bleeding. Cause I'm tired of cleaning up all the blood. I'm not putting this toxic shit on my skin! Last summer I sealed a giant gash on my leg with it. I'm still here. That's a good stapler. I can't do this. I can't squeeze it at this angle. Can you help me? Or do you want me to keep bleeding all over the place? Fine. Oh... You think it hit any organs? I don't know, man. I'm still breathing. Stay still. Scream into this. Wait. Wait Hold on. Okay. Let's go. How is it doing? The glue isn't holding well. What, are you scared of a little blood? You are! I've just seen too much of it. No, I get it. Even in this mess you got a total OCD thing going on. Hold still. Blow on it. What is it? Those freaks started a fire. What are they? Devil worshippers or witches? Does it look like I would know the difference? I don't know. But that's the same shit they were doing earlier. I thought I'd seen it all out here. I guess you never know. I'm still bleeding. You gotta stop moving. We did it your way but I still need a doctor. I know. They're together. You should get your shotgun. I'm gonna need your help. I'm here. Good. 'Cause I'm done with these assholes. Same. I need you to keep an eye out. If any of them come near me or the house, don't yell. Blow on this. And if things go south, the only weapons in the house are the knives in this drawer. When I get outside, I gotta unscrew the security bulb before it goes off. I think I can hug the wall and get it. Don't lock the door until you know I'm safe. - Got it. - Be ready to let me back in. Okay. What? You gonna shoot us old man? Keep fucking with me and find out! Come here you little bitch! He's back here! I see him! Ow! Mother fucker! Hey! It's me! Open the door! Hey! Open the damn door! We got you, fucker! Pst. One more step, I fucking dare you. We're cool, man. We just want the girl. You ain't getting her. Oh, we will. Pew! Pew! Open the fucking door! Are you alright? That fucker grabbed me, but I'm okay. We have a gun now, assholes! Oh, they know. I shot one of them. Is he dead? I don't think so. That's all I could get. Plus one in the chamber. We're gonna need more than that. It'll get us to the truck. What happened? I tangled with a bunch of pricks. You can't do anything with those in your hand. Let me see. I just realized I don't know your name. Reed. Kiera. One more. Thank you. Kiera. Can you run? I think so. I think they got the hint. It's time to move. We'll go at your pace back to the truck. I'll cover you. Stay low and keep quiet. Got it. Let's go. Take it. You piece of junk. What's wrong? C'mon. They fucked it up good. We gotta go back in. Looking for something? You're not going anywhere tonight. Shoot her! It's only bird shot. She's out of range! Give it to me. Why should I give it to you? Maybe I'll let you live. You can stay, but we're leaving. But where will you go? Away from you. I'm afraid that's not quite how this evening pans out. I'd advise you not to get any closer. We have such grand plans for you both. We can't spoil that by leaving now, can we? You will both serve well in our celebration of Orobas! Mars has risen high on this very night and virility courses through the men who have been graced. What in the name of hell is she talking about? Don't you know, brother? Can't you feel it? The ancient celestials have aligned and our union shall spawn forth His infernal destiny. Come, let me show you what generosity Orobas holds for you. We shall serve together as generals in his armies. Stay the fuck back! Reed! C'mon get up! Let's go! Get up! Who's fucking next?! Holy shit. - Nice shot. - Thanks. Fuck off or it's your funeral, too! You will pay for that. I promise you. Well at least there's one less of 'em. Hey, what's up? I've never shot anyone before. We got two shells left. We'll save those for the biggest guys. The bitch is mine. They're not going anywhere, even if we wait it out 'till sunrise. But wouldn't people see from the road? Nobody comes down that road but me. That's why I live here. But don't you have neighbors? This is the only occupied house around for miles. The rest are just winter homes. I know you must be tripping with all that blood. Yell if you hear anything. And pop the safety over if you need to use it. Been there, done that. - Anything? - Nothing. So I assume there's no way of fixing the truck? Not unless you have a spare distributor cap. Where's the vehicle you drove here in? It's on a dirt road somewhere. Where? I don't know. You guys were hanging out just east of my place. The road is south. Which direction did you drive here to get there? Left, right? I don't know. We smoked a lot of weed today. Figures. Either way, I don't have the keys. Who does? You mean who did? George had them. Or maybe Pete. I don't know. It's wherever they left them after they attacked us. You remember where that was? Wherever their bonfire was. I don't fucking know. But I did come up from the front of your house. Okay, that's a start. That's from the south. If you can hold on for just a few more hours, 'til sunrise, we can take the shotgun and go there and get the keys. What's wrong? I'm fine. So what's your deal, Reed? What do you mean, what's my deal? Why do you live out here surrounded by nothing? Why did you come to my house and fuck my life up? Survival! Do you have a family? - Not any more. - What? They're all dead. Sorry. That sucks. So how long were you guys out there camping? We just got here today. We were supposed to stay through the weekend. I'm sorry about your friends. Are you just saying that because that's what people say? Yeah, I guess so. I figured. I actually mean it. You know, I had a bad feeling about this trip. I was planning on breaking up with Pete when we got back home. He had no idea. But I'd been wanting out for a long time. But you know how it is when you're in a relationship. No, I don't. What? You've never been in a relationship? Nothing longer than a night. That's wild. That was over twenty years ago. And that explains why you're pissed off all the time. You're lucky you caught me on a good day. So where's your family? My mom's in Florida taking care of my son. Wait, you got a kid? I do. He's four years old. His name's Roger but I call him Buzz. I'd show you a picture but... I don't have my phone. You have a four year old? You're just a kid yourself. I need to get home. Let me show you something. Can you get up? Yeah, I think so. This is Marlon. Oh my gosh, he's adorable. Well rise and shine, little buddy. Say hi to Kiera. Hi, Marlon. He's all I got. If I don't make it out of here, please take care of him for me. Okay. Of course. What does he eat? Bloodworms. And the occasional guppy. Go back to bed, little bud. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that my friends chose your place to camp. I'm sorry I brought those crazy fucks back to your place. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. It's not your fault. Please, I need you to keep it together. I had family, I had friends. You still have friends. What about your parents, Reed? Go in the bed room. Hide. Are you ready for us, sweet doe? I'm right here. I always will be. Kiera! On your feet! Or what? You gonna shoot me? No. I'm gonna walk out front and shoot your den mother in the gut, and make you watch her bleed out. Hurry up, mother fucker! Oh, shit. You alright? I'm here. Go check it out! Holler if you need me. Now turn around. March! I'm gonna rape your mother for that! Listen up, freaks! Go back to where you came from before I blow his dog shit brains all over this yard. No need for any more of that, brother. You have sixty seconds! Set Brother Earl free. He is required for the ceremony. Spare him and you'll live forever. Forty-five seconds! You know we're not leaving. They're really showing how much they care about you. How's that feel tough guy? I'm gonna put you in your grave! You may not live to regret that, brother! Take the rest of your creeps and fuck off or I swear you're next. You people and your guns. You have no idea what it means to take a life with intimacy and meaning. Back off inbred! He was cutting the bars with a hacksaw. You holding up? I'm here. What was that gunshot? RIP another scumbag. Nice. What happened?! Fucker got me with a crowbar. Let me see. It looks like it's your turn for the stapler. We're running out of time. They'll come out soon. I can feel it. We'll burn them out if they don't. I don't think we should stick around here any longer. I thought we were waiting for daylight. Yeah well, we're out of shells and outnumbered. We're sitting in a death trap. Shit, your arm is really fucked, isn't it. It's fine. It's good. Grab that cup then. Look, Reed, if your arm isn't working, I need to know. We're in this together. - My hand's gone numb. - Let me see. Can you feel this? Can you at least move it? Alright, that's a start. Reed. The car keys! Remember where you parked? I don't! It was too dark. C'mon think. Think. Think. Remember. Where did you park? I'm trying! I'm trying. Wait, there was this beat up couch on the side of the road. The one with the peace sign on it? Yes! I know where that is. OK, but what about the rest of the maniacs out there? It's only a matter of time before they get in here and kill us. Alright. You got a plan? Yes. But first I'll need your help with something. I'm here. Hey, little buddy. Yeah. I'll be back soon. Don't you worry. Maybe they don't know we're out of shells. So act like you're not. Okay. When you head out the back door, run straight into the desert. About three hundred yards you'll come to an old well. If they make it and I don't, keep running in that direction. You're gonna find the couch and your car. Wait, what's going on? I'm heading up to the roof. I'm gonna divert them all to the front of the house. Once you see them there head out the back door, but leave it open. To lure them in. No, no, we're in this together, we leave together. You're in bad shape. If you can just get past the house lights and into the darkness, they won't see you. And I can distract them long enough to give you some time. - Just get to your car. - I'm not leaving you. Do you want to see your son again? I'll be right behind you. Attention you assholes. We're injured. We're not gonna make it through the night. We need to get to a hospital. We can help you with that. How do we end this? Come down and join our reveling. Not until I know that the girl won't be harmed. How noble of you. Where is she? She's in the bedroom. Interesting. Passed out from loss of blood. I want to see her. Not until I know what you want with us. We're running short on time, brother. Come down, partake with us, and then we'll explain everything on the way to the hospital. - Where's your vehicle? - It's far away. Get it. Your demands exhaust my patience. Priestess! The back door is open! She's not there, is she? For fuck's sake? You and that camera. C'mon man, it's tradition. I've told you before. Get it outta my face or I'm gonna bust it over your head. Find them! Say cheese! Surprise fuck face! - Bring it on, you fucking cunt! - Get down there! Kiera. Why'd you come back? I don't feel so good. You don't look so good. Excellent! You're awake and can finally commence! Did you dream well, brother? What the fuck do you want? Isn't it curious how some questions reveal their answers? You can and kill me all you want. Just let her go. Nobility is a trait very much lacking among the subhumans of this realm, so your gesture is unexpected. But unfortunately, you are both very much needed tonight. Lady what you need is professional help. You really don't understand why you're here, do you? The ancients they knew the importance of building strength through lineage. Like the deitiesIsis isis and Osiris, the Pharaohs often mated with their first degrees. Through these magical couplings their dynasties gained strength. And under the alignment of certain stars these intertwined offspring could be made even more powerful. And on rare occasions like tonight, they could even bring forth the gods they worshiped in human form. What kind of fucking drugs are you guys on? Orobas shall return and take his rightful place as ruler of this domain, and we have been chosen as the ones who bring him forth. I need your river of life. - River of what? - Your river of life. The seed that Enki implanted into Ninhursag to make her bare Ninsar. Let it flow into me. Somebody please tell me what the fuck she's talking about? She wants you to fuck her, Reed. Exactly, my sweet doe. You need to fuck a child into me. Is that clear enough for you? No, no. No, get one of your brain dead goons for that kinky shit. They're not special like you. Not like you at all. You have been touched by the spirit of Orobas as well and, as such, you must be the one to ignite the spark within me. On this night the prophecy dictates the viability of our union and the health of our spawn is assured. I'm nobody. Please leave me alone. In due time. Just cooperate. Go fuck yourself. Since you're a man that needs a little encouragement, your little friend here is my bargaining chip. Your performance for her life. You sick freak! Shame. I was hoping you'd find me enchanting. I find you repulsive. I don't know if I should be flattered or offended. What you should be is dead. Why do you have to make this... ...so hard? Get off me. The longer you resist, the more pain we will inflict. Your agony will pale in comparison to hers. Shall we continue? Die! I'd rather die than fuck you. Sister Maxine? You gonna die. Wait. Wait. Wait! Stop! I'll do it! Let's begin. If I do this, will you let her live? You have my word. Let's go. I thought you'd never ask. I can't do it in front of these creeps. They are essential for the ceremony. No ceremony, no magic. Don't worry, just focus on us. Dearest Reed, it is time for you to learn who you really are. Let go... Many years ago, under a full moon like tonight, I was born into the arms of the ancient demon Orobas. My parents gave their lives so I could take my place as high priestess of the dark arts. My mother was the most beautiful woman on Earth, but she harbored a secret my father didn't know, nor did my brethren until later. A secret we have sought my entire life. I had a twin brother. And we have finally found him. It was such a shame that you and I didn't get to grow up together. But now we're forever united in creating the vessel through which Orobas will take human form. He shall rise again to reclaim all that once was his. How does it feel to fuck your twin sister? You've done very well, brother. Your virility has matched your blood lust. We have fulfilled our birthright and our child will rule this dimension as destined by prophecy. I'm sorry. Even though Sister Maxine would prefer I not, I shall spare your life. Will you please fucking untie us now? Don't push it, sweet doe. I only promised to let you live. Someday, I'm going to find him and I'm gonna cut his heart out while you watch. Eat shit, you fucking bitch! Hey, lover boy! Look what I found! This is for our fallen brothers. Don't you fucking do it! Onward, brethren. We have much to do. Reed. Reed. Come on. Lets go! It's not done. What do you mean? Marlon. I'm sorry. Listen, run to the road that way. In a few hours, you'll hit a gas station. Get the fuck out of here. I'm killing every goddamned one of them. Not without me. Are you sure you want to leave them like that? The girl is ready to pass. Starvation and dehydration will get him eventually. I'm gonna go piss. Why'd you drink that rancid shit? - We lost brothers tonight. - Hurry up. We have a long walk back to the van. What was that? Claude fucking around, as usual. Sister Maxine, check on your son. What is this? This all could have been so much easier, my brother.
