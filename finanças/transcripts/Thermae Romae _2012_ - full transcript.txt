The founding of the Roman Empire dates back to 753 B.C. Through centuries of warfare and conspiracy the Empire dominated neighboring tribes and seized provinces until ultimately, Rome emerged as the greatest empire in the world. The succession of emperors that contributed to its prosperity were deified and worshipped as gods, their names etched in history. 128 A.D. The reigning Emperor Hadrianus was known for purging those who opposed him and was feared as a tyrant. But even in such tumultuous times, the Roman people loved their bathhouses called Thermae. And by building a magnificent Thermae, the Emperor won over the Roman people. "Thermae Romae" 128 A.D. What's wrong with my design? Don't you see, Lucius? Look at all the modern buildings around you... What of them? Your Thermae designs are outdated. Outdated? It's intentional! To recreate the good, old days that Romans have forgotten! Sire! Here are the blueprints! This is the new architect I've hired. I'm Virtue. Nice to meet you. I see I'm no longer needed. Sorry. But if you come up with any new ideas... Let's hear your concept, Virtue. A giant stone statue surrounded by fountains... Lucius, Thermae architect Fools! Unemployed in this booming economy? I traveled all the way to Athens to study architecture. Those idiots... Stop pouting. No wonder you're unlucky. Wanna have a good time? Forget it. Go home and bang your wife. She's dying to have kids, right? No? Fine, let's go to the bathhouse. Rome wouldn't be Rome without our baths. Business is jumping! Yahoo! Of course. No one loves baths more than us Romans. So refreshing! Thermae (Public Bath) I heard Emperor Hadrianus loves baths, too. Even a merciless tyrant is human, after all. Tyrant? Tip. Haven't you heard? Word is when Hadrianus became Emperor, he ruthlessly murdered four senators that opposed him. And that's not all. He abandons hard-won territories and does nothing but travel. What kind of emperor is that? Tackle him! It's utter chaos in here. The bath used to be a place for rejuvenation. Not Wrestling or swimming. Get your pastries! Pastries, indeed. What's become of our baths? Our oasis of relaxation? Hair removal, please! You're so uptight. No wonder you got fired. They're all the same. These fools... They've forgotten that Rome is the greatest civilization on earth! At this rate, the great Roman Empire will fall sooner rather than later. I can only find peace underwater... If only I could think of a novel idea to displace this gaudy Thermae... Novel idea... Novel idea... Novel idea... Owww! Where the hell am I? It's...Mt. Vesuvius of Pompei! Hey you! You been sunk at the bottom for a mighty long time. They're not Romans. I wonder if he understands...? Did he come by himself? Their faces... ...are flat. Aha! This must be a bathhouse for slaves! It must be connected to the passageway I came through. Hey, foreigner. Better get out before you get dizzy. Is he telling me to get out because this bath is not for Romans? I guess it's understandable... This is the only place where slaves can relax. But wait...what are these sophisticated implements? A huge mirror made of a sheet of glass! And flawless images on these posters! All work of master craftsmen... What kind of slaves are they? So these baskets are for clothes... I can copy this. Hey, foreigner. Where's your clothes? Were they stolen? This is it! Simplicity and functionality over grandiosity. Perfect for modern Romans seeking something new! Can I show this place to my fellow architects? I didn't take your clothes! Why is he so flustered? Is he worried that I'm going to copy their designs? Clearly, these people value their bath culture highly. But they belong to our empire now. We're entitled to absorb their culture. Hey! Where are you going all naked? Yell all you want, slaves! A sun-shielding cloth at the entrance. Another good idea. Where are you going? They're still hiding something. My hero... Excuse him. Get him out of here. Please excuse him. Where the hell am I? Cheer up and have a drink. Ahhhh, delicious! I'll open yours, too. Delicious! So cold and sweet! Fruit Milk It's cow's milk, but it tastes like fruit... How do they make such a drink? These provincial folks have clearly surpassed our culture. Crap! Don't cry. They mustn't know of our defeat... Lucius! Lucius! He's awake! Where am I...? You drowned in the bath so we carried you here. The Flat Faced Clan? Flat Face? What are you talking about? Thank god you're okay. Was it a dream? A few months later Is this the new Thermae? I hear it's nothing like we've ever seen. This basket is handy. What a great idea. Look at these event posters. I just saw this comedy. - Fruity cow's milk anyone? - What a neat bottle. How convenient to see what's playing this week. Give me one. - Everything's so original! - Look over there! Mt. Vesuvius and the Bay of Naples. - A splendid view. - So elegant. Roman pines and the Bay of Naples. - This bucket is nice. - So relaxing. Chilling bottled milk underground... --.eh? It was sweeter and colder. And the bottle and lid are far from perfect. Your ambition is admirable. I'll have another. It's not me... It's the innovative spirit of those slaves. The Flat Faced Clan... Master, are you ready? A soak in the bath is life's greatest pleasure. If only I had one at home. Don't be spoiled. Only the rich aristocrats have baths at home. Can't I dream? Where is your exfoliator, Master? - Isn't that it? - Oh, there it is. I'll get it for you. It is hard for the elderly to come for a soak in the baths. I'm sure many of them have given up on it. For Thermae-loving Romans, it's like being robbed of life itself. Isn't there something I can do? Bath in the home... Bath in the home... Bath in the home... Where am I? It's cramped in here. And getting hotter and hotter! Arghh! What? Am I in that other world again? A hot water coffin? Or could it be a tub for bathing? If so, their passion for bathing is astounding. How do they stoke a fire in such a small space? I'd hate to be a slave... What is this thing connected to a tube like an animal's intestine? And this lid covering the tub... It must serve the purpose of trapping the heat inside. These things may look ridiculous but I'm certain they possess some inherent function... that no one in our civilization could ever fathom. You stayed up all night to write this? It's crap! The story is old, the characters are dull! The hero isn't even charismatic! You can't become a manga artist just because you can draw. Go home and take care of your parents. You have no talent! Is the bath ready? Father! The bath is over there! The helper will be here soon! Okay, Yoneko-san. It's Michiko! Oh! A foreign helper. Start with my back, please. So much dead skin! Ouch! You're scraping off the young skin underneath. What is this washcloth made of? My head is next. A crown?! Is this old man the King of the Flat Faced Clan? Shampoo like this. Then rinse. See? My face isn't wet! Words cannot express this staggering sense of defeat. Charismatic hero... Charismatic hero! Even this cylinder must perform some mind-boggling function. MY eyes! My eyes! Where's my muscular foreigner?! He's gone... Through the window? No. Into thin air... One month later You pass out at the bath, and the next thing you know, you invent a home bath. Plus a foam-shielding visor and a contraption made of cow intestine! You're a genius! How is it, Master? Heaven! Pure heaven! Look! People are coming by every day for a glimpse of it. You're a rising star. Isn't it wonderful, Master? Marcus says that you're one of the top architects in Rome. It's a misunderstanding. All I did is reproduce what I've seen. I haven't invented a thing. Never mind. Eat! Eat! Snails and goat testicles... all aphrodisiacs. We're sure to produce an heir that will inherit your talents... What's wrong? I have no appetite... Shirking me off again? It's always the same. Work, work, work! You don't care how I feel. I want a child so badly, but you're never up to it. Useless! Sorry to disturb you at this late hour. Is Lucius Modestus here? The Emperor is anxious to meet you. Emperor Hadrianus? Me? Master Ceionius! Ah, Lucius. The Emperor is waiting. Even I cannot set foot inside. You must go alone. The Emperor is a difficult man. Ceionius, Successor to Hadrianus One slip of the tongue and your head will roll. I hope you make it out alive. Is this Thermae your design? Lucius Modestus at your service! A mural of Mt. Vesuvius in a Thermae. How ridiculous. Yet magnificent. Thermae and Rome are one in the same. Bigger is not necessarily better. Grander is not necessarily better. Provide a haven to soothe the soul and the people will be happy. I couldn't agree more. Hadrianus, 14th Emperor of Rome It appears we think alike. You may make a great tyrant, like me. It's not hard to guess what the people think of me. What I've learned from touring the provinces is that Rome is vast. There is only so much we can control through military force. But if we can command the people through culture, there will be no need for war. So the objective of your travels was to bring peace to Rome. To contemplate peace, one's mind must be at ease. I need a Thermae. I want to show you something. I've made some revisions to your design. It's beautiful... Build me a private bath. Something new... that has never been seen before. Think of it as service to the Roman Empire. Will you help me? For the Roman Empire... I'll do it. Please leave it to me! Emperor Hadrianus' Villa This entire villa was designed by the Emperor himself. So you were commissioned to build him a private bath. Yes, but Master Antoninus, his bath was so resplendent... His Highness is an accomplished architect. But his exceptional genius also isolates him. He is at odds with the Senate. There are few he can trust. It seems you are one of them. Antoninus, Emperor's Adviser Make him a splendid Thermae. It will be his salvation. Build a bath here? My mind is drawing a blank. What would the Flat Faced Clan do? That's it! If I follow that passageway, I may be able to see them again. No! What am I doing? Using their provincial culture as a crutch? But what good will come of brooding on my own? If I don't impress the Emperor, I have no future! Argh! My pride isn't Worth crap! I'll swallow my pride and ask them for help! Hurry Lucius! 2012 A.D. Shinjuku, Tokyo Miss Yamagoshi! What are you doing? It almost overﬂowed! You're always half asleep. Be more industrious. You're not paid just for being here, you know. I'm sorry... You were probably up late... The Land of the Flat Faced Clan! It's boiling furiously!! But it's not hot. Why...? You know him? Barely... So you're sneaking men in here? No... What is this vibration? It's bubbly! It feels good... You! Get out of here! Ow...Let me go! How dare you touch my toga, slave! Are you okay? You won't get away with this! Director! Director? Oh, no! What's going on? I'm here. I may as well see what I can of your civilization. I see. She wants a tip for showing me around. Greedy slave. Thanks... He's definitely unique... The writing on this papyrus... It must be a valuable document tied closely to their culture. Only babies are praised for making doo-doo. Over here, Director. The Director is coming! What is this space? Is this sublime fragrance coming from these candles? Soothing... What is this? An aquarium embedded in the wall! Soothing! It's not just the tub. The detail! The ingenious use of space! I merely copy what I see in books. I'm so out of my depth... What made me think I could build a bath fit for an Emperor? It makes my stomach turn... The bathroom? Where's the bathroom? Bathroom? Over here. A lid! At first glance, a clever device. But when you're in a rush... it's a pain in the... How many slaves are they using here? I'd hate to be a slave... I see. It's meant to be read while doing one's business. Where's the ass-wiper? Could this be...a device to wash the ass? It's definitely more sanitary than sea sponges dipped in water... Wonder Wave Washlet What is this sensation? This could be addicting. Where's the guy? Inside? Director! No one's here. But look! This is proof! Miss Yamagoshi...you're fired. A few months later I'm so embarrassed. Drowning at your villa... Never mind. You're alive and here I am soaking in this bath of bubbles. And that toilet. I would have never thought of an ass-washing shower. Some men don't simply copy other cultures. They invent their own. Like you. In this Thermae, I can immerse myself in thoughts of Rome's future. All thanks to you. I'll reward you immediately. Go buy something for your wife. You are too kind. Livia! Emperor Hadrianus... Lucius! The pits... What brings you home? I've called you a hundred times but you never return my calls. Whatever... Were you told you have no talent? Fired from your temp job? Or both? In any case, you'll have to earn your keep. So, get to it. I know! I see you're slacking off again! Mami! Hey, hey, hey! You're back! So you're all still alive. It's no joke. The village elder is on his last legs now. Chief! Chief! I saw the River... It must've been the River Styx. Stop stuffing yourself, you pig! Professor, I wanted you to look at something. This looks like Latin. Latin? The guy who gave it to me... was wearing this wrap. That's a toga. The ancient Romans wore them. So is this an ancient Roman coin? Ancient Rome? Hadrianus. 14th Emperor of the Roman Empire. Known for his difficult personality, a talented architect... Loved to travel, was hardly in Rome. Made coins of places he visited. Tripoli...that means... In 128 A.D., Hadrianus launched on his second tour of the provinces. He crossed Athens and Antiochia into Alexandria, Egypt. All seemed to be going well, but... Lucius. Is the architect Lucius here? Get a hold of yourself! Master Antoninus... What happened to you? Nothing, really... Actually, I came here to seek your help... The Emperor lost a young boy named Antinous in the Nile. Now he's lost his will to live. Antinous was my reason for living. Now all I do is think about the wonderful times we spent together... On the fertile bank of the Nile a sacred crocodile appeared and I tasted the sweetest, most fragrant fruit imaginable. Ever since Antinous's death my life has stood still. I brought that crocodile from the Nile as the incarnation of Antinous. But a crocodile from the Nile can only survive in the Nile... When this crocodile dies, it will also be the end of me. That's absurd. I'm counting on you to reign for many more years to come. Damn good! Done. I see. So this is an ancient Roman? Mami, you're a genius. He's going to be my next hero. Muscle-man gladiator. Look. I've been learning about ancient Rome. Hold on! I had my college buddy check out this fabric using a method called radiocarbon dating. The composition is different from modern linen. This toga may be the real deal. What do you mean? I'm saying that the guy Mami met may be a genuine ancient Roman! No way! An ancient Roman? He disappeared all of a sudden, right? How did he appear, then? All of a sudden... The first time, at my local bathhouse. Then, at my manga studio and the time after that, at my bath exhibit in Shinjuku. All different places. No common thread. But there is. Yeah. He appears every time Mami's there. That's...just a coincidence! No! It's fate! Wait a second. Stop talking nonsense and go take a bath! - What's this? - Prospective husband. Hey, hey, hey. Isn't this the heir to the ltami Hotel chain? Aren't you rushing things, mom? We may not be able to support her any more. What do you mean? We may have to close this inn. Why? Really? What? Didn't you know? We've been in the red for some time now! You can't become a manga artist just because you can draw. Go home and take care of your parents. All right. Fine. I'll meet the guy. But what about your dream to become a manga artist? You're studying ancient Rome for your next series... Never mind. It was my last hurrah anyways. It's a good chance to give it up. Stop, Master Ceionius! Not here. So not even you could help him... His Highness has lost the will to recover. Master Ceionius, please... It's you, Lucius. You must have time to kill, coming all the way out here. His fondness for women is a problem. He's rumored to be the next Emperor. That philanderer... We mustn't allow Hadrianus to relinquish power yet. Ah, this is the place in need of repair. It looks clogged. By the way, Lucius, why were you so depressed? Actually, I recently lost my wife... to my best friend. It's pitiful. Every day for seven years, she nagged me for a child. It became such a burden... Now I regret not being more accommodating. Lucius! Lucius! It's all your fault! I told you I wanted a baby! Livia... Livia... Livia...! Please help me get pregnant! It's the Holy Phallus! Give me a beautiful baby this year. Please, Holy Phallus. Please give me a baby! It's the Phallus God! Holy Phallus! Flat-faced children! I'm trapped in this cage! Uh...Thank you for agreeing to go outwith me. If you don't mind... will you date me with the intention of marriage? What is he doing here? Key! Hurry! Hurry! Get out of there. I'll bring you a towel and clothes. Wait here! Come with me! This is... I see. The Flat Faced Clan also raises crocodiles... Maybe this is connected to the Nile somehow. Okay, show me! Such an obtuse slave. Hey! Put me down. No! It's fate! Ow! What are you doing? I see. They're heating the room with these pipes. To simulate the temperature of the Nile. That way, they can grow tropical plants in here! Have you never eaten a banana before? Such an exquisite flavor! The texture is so soft, yet there is no juice. Are you really an ancient Roman? The taste is mild. Yet it's so rich and satisfying! Could this be the fruit that the Emperor tasted on the Nile? Banana seed This granule... How a Banana Grows grows into this fruit? If I take this back, the Emperor may regain his strength! Oh, well. Let's find you some clothes. No, no! You can't drink that. Look! They're delicious. Oh my god! Amazing! What are you doing? Wait! That precious fruit may save the Roman empire! Where are you going? Where are you? Where did you go? This is...an outdoor bath! This sense of freedom cannot be experienced in an indoor bath. There it is! I can't return to Rome without it! The fate of Rome depends on that fruit! Lucius! Are you all right? The fruit! It's here... A while later A Nile-themed bath. Brilliant. Now I will always remember Antinous. Antinous This facility has even rejuvenated the crocodile. Crocodile And this fruit... It's exactly what I tasted on the Nile. Thank you, Lucius. You are too kind. You don't look happy. What is wrong? I'll be honest with you, Your Highness. The reproduction of the Nile... and even this fruit. They're all the ideas of the Flat Faced... Sire! The uprising is gaining momentum. We can't control them any longer! Prepare to leave immediately. The seal of the Danube River. That means... The Romans fought bitterly with the tribes on the northern banks of the Danube River. The battle raged for three years. The enemy has enlisted foreign troops as well. On the other hand, our troops are totally exhausted. We've incurred heavy losses... Your Highness! Lucius Modestus! I have a letter from the Emperor. Dearest Lucius. This letter must come as a surprise. I am getting old and must begin thinking about a successor. I plan to adopt Ceionius as my heir. Master Ceionius... For his first project I will commission him to build a great bath for the people. I would like you to construct it. Build a great Thermae that will surpass all the baths that came before it. Then, the people will support Ceionius as my successor. I'm counting on you. Emperor Hadrianus You're the fairest maiden in all of Rome. You have such a way with words. I mean every word. Excuse me for being late, Master Ceionius. Thanks for coming. The woman... We just met. Don't mind her. So you're going to build my Thermae here. Yes... The Emperor is crazy. He thinks a bathhouse will capture the hearts of the people. If I may say so, Thermae is an indispensable part of Roman life. All baths are the same. If you're going to build one, make it grand. And...if I refuse to build this Thermae? Disobeying the Emperor is an act of treason and a capital offense. So I must build a Thermae for him... You're the Thermae architect! Because of you, I'm out of work! What?! Shut up! My back! He's awake! That's good. This floor is so warm... Natural heat... Huh? My back doesn't hurt. Are you okay? His arm is hurt. Hot huts are good for the circulation... The hydrogen bicarbonate bath might be good, too. Yeah! Let's go. This is... What terrible injuries! I've never seen such wounds, even on Roman soldiers. He must be a military commander. This guy was hit by a truck. Look here. I fell off a roof on a construction job. This must be a Thermae for wounded soldiers! The last time I was here, I was so taken with the open-air bath, I didn't realize the mineral spring and heat had healing properties as well. Here you go. Par-boiled egg. Eat up! Yummy! Good, isn't it? Good eating transcends boundaries! Want to try some home-brew too? Wine. Bottom's up. Poison! He's poisoned me! It's gone bad. I should have known! The army officer! He tricked me with the egg... A formidable enemy! The contour of your profile is elegant like the Basilica. Your arms that hold me are stronger than the Arch of Titus. If I could only see you again... And here you are! What happened? I was poisoned... Poisoned... Poison? What are you doing? Huh...? I am well! It has an antidotal effect. You speak...my language. I took a crash course in Latin. What's your name? Lucius Modestus. Lucius... Argh! The wine is hitting me now... Master Ceionius. You're finally awake. You've had a terrible experience. I'm so ashamed. By the way...who is she? Where am I? Rome. Are you serious? She's not Roman... But she's beautiful. Lucky girl. You caught my eye. Master Ceionius. I'm taking her with me. Huh? Let me go! Stop it! Let me go! What's going on? Master Antoninus. That Antoninus? Master Ceionius, what's going on? That Ceionius? It's none of your business. Let me go! She doesn't want to go. What are you doing? Let me go! You'll regret this! Thank you so much. It was nothing... Lucius, is it true you're building a Thermae for Ceionius? Well... I'm thinking of declining. Do you realize what the consequences will be? Disobeying the Emperor is punishable by death! Of course, I understand that. Wait, are you seriously going to the battlefield? Why? We all do jobs that we don't want to sometimes. We all suck it up and do it. It happens all the time where I come from. Then you are a sad lot. I'm proud to be a Thermae architect. My conscience will not allow me to build such a bath. Why are you so stubborn? They'll kill you! - Let me go. - No, I won't! If they kill you, that's it! You need to think about yourself. I am. That's why I'm going. I refuse to live if I must compromise my soul. Lucius! One and all! I have an announcement of a deployment to Pannonia! Senator Antoninus has been commissioned to be the governor of Pannonia Province. Where did she go? This is rotten. Isn't that Mami's... Could she have drowned? Drowned...? No way. Latin for Dummies Mami! Mami! Where are you? Are you okay? It's deep! The enemy has increased their reinforcements. Run this strategy to the commander at the front line. Your Highness, Lucius is here. What happened? You have... an important project to finish. Actually... That's why I'm here. I... cannot build a Thermae for Master Ceionius. I'm sorry! You don't... accept Ceionius as Emperor. Is that what you're saying? I'm fully aware of my impertinence. I am prepared for any punishment. I see. Never mind. You... saved my life once. Your Highness! But... Don't ever show your face again! Take him! Come. It's warm... Sour...like that mineral spring. You're still here? Off with you! Do you want to die here? Go! Get out! Thank god you're alive! I can't breathe... Sorry. Any news while I was away? Oh, yeah. Antoninus is being deployed to Pannonia. For five years. A long time... It's my fault. I'm sure Master Ceionius is behind this. But men of rank are sent to the provinces sooner or later. Don't worry about it. Wait a minute. What year is it? 135 A.D. So until 140 A.D... The course of history will be changed! It's Ceionius who's supposed to go to Pannonia. He dies of the plague and Antoninus succeeds the throne. That's historical fact! Master Antoninus? But as things stand now, Ceionius will be Emperor... You're not making any sense. Listen carefully! If Antoninus doesn't succeed him, Hadrianus will never be deified! What do you mean? The Roman Senate hates Hadrianus. They'll oppose his deification. But Antoninus will convince them to deify Hadrianus. How can I believe such a preposterous story? You have to believe me. If he's not deified, all his achievements will be nullified. And that's not all. He'll go down in history as the Foolish Emperor. Master Ceionius! I'd like to ask you something. Will you deify Emperor Hadrianus once you succeed him? The Emperor has made enemies in the Senate. It may be difficult. What do you want from me? I heard you refused to build my Thermae. What do you expect from me? Fool... Throwing your future away on a whim. Now that I think about it, even your talent is suspect. How did you manage to Win your fame? You're a fake! Lucius... Are you okay? Are you Lucius, the architect? I can't believe it's you. Your Thermae is the best! I just love your bottled milk... Stop it! I'm... not the man you think I am. Wait a minute! Lucius! I'm incompetent... The only reason I was hired by the Emperor was because I copied your Thermae. I'm just a man who stole your ideas. Are you serious? Then... ...why? Why did you drown so many times? Wasn't it because you were always preoccupied with new ideas? If you saw our world as a result of your creative struggle then you found the answer through your own hard work. You are not incompetent! You have nothing to be ashamed of! If we can stop Master Antoninus from going to Pannonia, will history stay its course? I believe so. Lucius, what's going on? Master Antoninus, I have an important matter to discuss. We'll cross these mountains and attack from behind... Lucius! What are you doing here! Did you forget what I said? I'm sorry. But I have a message from Master Antoninus. From Antoninus? He suggested that I build a Thermae right here. On the battlefield? The soldiers are totally exhausted. There is a mineral spring here with healing properties. Ridiculous! How can a bath heal wounds? It's true! If the soldiers recover Rome's victory will follow. Fine. I will take his suggestion. Let's put this plan to work. Then... I will get started. Lucius. Was this your idea? No, sire. It was Master Antoninus'. I see. Are you really going to build a bath here? Yes. If I can contribute to Rome's victory, Master Antoninus' deployment may be rescinded. The soldiers are exhausted. I have to do it. They're too weak. Dad! Hey, hey, hey! Mami! What are you doing here? I don't know. We drowned and the next thing we knew we were in the middle of a battlefield! But I'm glad you're alive. Dad! Wait, maybe not. Maybe we all died and this is the other side. My love! Where are you? Chief, Chief! This is Rome! Ancient Rome! 135 A.D.! - No way! - It's true. But anyways... What's he doing? Making a bath. A bath? What for? To save Rome. No way! It's true. It's impossible. How many years does he think it'll take to build a bath here? But he has to. If these mineral springs don't heal their wounds, they'll never recover. Wounds? It's warm. Why not make a hot hut? A hot hut. All you need is a shed and straw mats. That's brilliant! Let's make a hut. The heated floors will help them to relax. Their wounds will heal. Steam. Wound. Heal. Why are they helping me like this? There's nothing in it for them. I don't understand the Flat Faced Clan. They always work as a team at the expense of the individual. They must value something above individual recognition. Professor. How's it going? Hot spring! Look! It's a hot spring! Good job! The first hut is done. The enemy forces are gaining momentum. Our men are still suffering the effects of poisoning. Rest in the hot hut. At this point... all I can do... is trust in him. Chief! Your Highness! The soldiers are recovering and returning to battle! Are they done? Now drink this mineral water. Here, drink it. You're good. I'm trying to convey information about the baths with pictures. Actually...manga. I wanted to be a manga artist. But I wasn't any good... I gave up and was going to get married. Then you appeared. I"... keep up the good fight. Thank you. I'm so glad I met you You're not even listening. Long live the Roman Empire! It looks good on you. Who would have thought a bath could heal? These eggs are delicious. I feel so energized! Finally... I can go home to my wife. Look. Polaris... The guiding star. When travelers lose their way, those stars guide them home. They've been around for 2,000 years... That's right... Will Emperor Hadrianus' achievements be remembered? Of course. The whole world will know of him. Good. Your Thermae will be remembered, too. As long as Emperor Hadrianus is remembered, that's enough. Ow! The smoke is burning my eyes! I'm grateful to you. Because of you, I feel like myself again. Stop it. To borrow your words... I'll keep up the good fight. So you did hear me... Thank you. I'm truly glad I met you. No fair. I've never seen you smile before. That's against the rules. What's happening? I see. So that's how it works. Whenever I returned to Rome from your country I was always crying. Does that mean I'm going back? I see. Will I ever see you again? I'm sure of it. All roads lead to Rome. We're back. That's good. I missed it here. What are you all doing? Up to no good again? Hurry up and get out! One month later Rome has successfully conquered the enemy. This victory belongs to the people. For building a Thermae on the battlefield I commend Antoninus. Come forward. Thank you for your great contribution. As requested, someone else will be sent to Pannonia. You're needed in Rome. You are too kind. And one more individual... The architect of this great bath is deserving of recognition. Lucius Modestus. Come forward! Did you think I could not see through your lies? You are worthy of praise. It wasn't me. But on behalf of everyone, I am honored to accept. Great! Congratulations, Lucius! Publius Aelius Hadrianus the 14th Emperor of Rome established peace and domestic stability, and was later deified by his successor Antoninus. Died, 138 A.D. Antoninus Pius Succeeded Hadrianus as the 15th Emperor of Rome. Maintained peace and stability througout his reign. Died, 161 A.D. Lucius Ceionius Commodus Commissioned governor of Pannonia Province.
