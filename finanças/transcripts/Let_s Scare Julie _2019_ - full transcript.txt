Yeah, on the couch at the bottom of the stairs, I've said it a thousand times. I've said it a thousand times. Yeah, and he sleeps with his gun when he drinks. Who does that? And he drinks like every night, so... Um, the kind of a guy who fucking... I'm just warning them, I'm trying to get them quiet. reads this. Oh my God, Taylor, really? Look, yeah... What the fuck is wrong with him? Okay, he would totally ground me if he found out you guys were here, so can you guys just not fuck around tonight, please? Look at this shit. Oh my God. You know who you're sleeping with? That's real. Like that's... that will hurt someone. What is this? It's sharp stuff. You have to be careful, okay? Wait, he doesn't know we're here? Yo, you thought he was coming through the window, huh? Oh my God. I'm shitting myself. You guys seriously like you need to... Stop Madison. Madison you clearly don't wanna get... I just got a nose job, do you like it? I swear to God. Don't I look cute like this? Didn't he like take your phone or something, Emma? Yeah, if you just said sorry for going through his stuff. Shit. Why would you do that? Took your phone. Well, if it's hidden, she always has to uncover it. Think about him. We all know where you keep your dildos, sweetheart. Shut up. You know he likes playing with at night. All I'm saying... All I'm saying is if you would have said sorry, he wouldn't have gone through your phone and found that pic, that's all I'm saying. What pic? You dirty girl. What pictures? What was it? - Okay, here... - Those legs are long. Stop wrestling her. It was... It was from a Jordy. A Jordy the Dick Redding. I fucking knew it!

Yeah, that's so true. Yeah, you're probably right. What? Smile. She's like actually good. You guys, yeah, don't... don't mess with her stuff. It's like from my uncle's and... Don't touch her ass, please. I didn't. You fucking ruined it. I didn't even say anything. Oh my God, Maddy. You already messed with her enough, let's just chill out. I'm gonna post these. No, don't post them. No, please don't post them. Can you include us? There's more than just the three of you here, come on. Oh my God. Someone's getting a little sensitive. I'm not getting sensitive about anything, right? You guys wanted to meet her, so come on, be cool. What better way to meet her than go through her shit. What the hell? Excuse me, miss. What the fuck are you doing with this above your bed while you're sleeping? Well, I just thought it was cool. Paige, what the fuck is this? You thought that was cool? This is horrifying. Does dad know you have that? He's gonna kill you. Did you just not learn your lesson? Jesus. Oh my goodness. That is creepy. - Yeah, okay, well, guys, just... - Yeah, she's so fucking creepy. - My dad took it from... - Wait, do I look like him? Yeah, you kind of do actually. This guy. Hi! Look at... do it... do it. Wait, I need to be... No, I don't wanna touch it. Oh yeah. Yeah. Guys, no, okay, Maddy. Look, guys. Jesus Chr... my dad took that from Ms. Drer's house, okay? Oh, you're making a video. - No, I did not do it. - I'd advise against it. I'd advise against touchin' it, okay? Oh, the Dur story? Oh my God, I don't wanna take a picture with it now. Dur? Bullshit. I don't know how to pronounce it. It's like German or something. Well, wait, he... he stole this? Uh... Yeah, he's like 6'5", Paige. He's a grown-ass man, he takes what he wants. Plus, it's not stealing since she was dead. Wait, what? Does that scare you? Yeah, yeah, after she died, like he found a key to her house in her driveway. I don't know. I don't know what... Yeah, the key was like... I saw it, it was a black one, and it was really creepy. Yeah, she found it in his stuff, too, that's why she got in trouble. So he went in there and... Have you not heard this? You live here. You must know the story. Please, tell the story for me at least. It's a horror story, so it's not like it's relevant. Okay, um... It's for our friend. He said, "Please, give me cigarette and scotch. I want cigarette." You are never gonna get invited back here. Can you just listen to Taylor? Okay, okay, okay. Thank you, buddy. Yeah, fine, I don't really care anymore explaining this. Just... you want her to tell it? Like. Oh my God. Yeah, please, tell the story. So Ms. Drer was like the neighbor nobody knew, I guess you could... Well, I don't know my neighbors. No, no, no. No. Oh my God. Paige. Okay, this woman, so she like lived there since before I was born, right, but nobody ever saw her. I mean, ever. There were all these rumors, though. Like that her kid had died in that house and um, and that she was into the supernatural or something. What do you mean, my friend? Wait, you guys never told me that. Yeah, that's because you never come over here. You always want us to come to your house. Yeah, but mine's the nicest. Okay, princess. Please, continue. Um, yeah, I mean I... I never saw her. Not even once in my whole life, and she was our neighbor, and it's pretty fuckin' weird, right? Um... But, I uh, I knew this boy who saw Ms. Drer once. Was he cute? - Paige. - Why the fuck do you care Paige? No one cares about that. - What? I don't care. - Why do you care? Never mind, sorry. Keep going. Um... I don't care. He uh, he was in front of her house and he saw her through the fence, just standin' on her front porch in this like dirty dress, staring right at him. But the... the crazy thing, okay, was that um, was that he said her skin was like dead. Like... like she was a corpse or something. Yes, just like Jess, just like Jess. Blue, and rotting, and I don't know. What do you mean? Like... okay, you guys are freaking me out. Excuse me. I don't know, it was pretty bizarre. What else happened? What did her skin look like? I already told you, rotting. I mean... - Oh my God. - I think of... So interesting. He said it looked like frostbite. Hmm. Ugh, that smells so bad, Madison. Well. Oh my God. Well, get out of my face. Okay. Do you have to be smoking right next to me, seriously? Just... he wants me to. Just keep ta... telling me about her skin. Why do you care so much? Jesus. Just wanna know about this... - You're such a weirdo. - I just... What are you doing... Madison, stop! - Stop it! - Oh my God, what are you doing? You smacked my ass! What am I supposed to do? JESS Dude, stop. You just literally licked the inside of my ear. That's disgusting. Oh my... Oh. He liked it. He told me to do it. What happened... Phew. To him? Um... Later that day he was... he was acting really weird. Um, I don't... uh, I don't know. Paranoid. Like... like something was watching him. What was watching him? He uh... he said he... he couldn't see anyone. Oh God. But um... but that he could like feel it. Like someone was... was goin' to be there, but she wasn't there yet, you know? He called me really upset right after he got this weird text. Um, he said that was bizarre, because like it came from nobody, there was no name, no username, no number, nothing. What was it? It was uh, this picture of him, but from directly behind him. What the fuck? He showed me. I don't think he was lying. Later uh... Later that night, he uh... He disappeared. Like he ran away or... Yes, no. He did not disappear. No, he disappeared, right in his own home. What? Shit, it's fine. Seems literally impossible. I'm sorry. I'm not tryin' to be dramatic or anything, just... I mean imagine if someone just disappeared, okay? Imagine if one of you guys disappeared. No one is gonna disappear, Taylor. But could you... could you imagine that? I'm j... I'm sorry, people just don't disappear. Maddy, Maddy. Take my friend, he make you feel better. I don't wanna touch your friend, Madison. I... I love you. Okay. Okay, stop it. Please, take me. For you. Okay, and he... Oh my God, take it back. Look, anyway, anyway... No, give him love. What are you doing? Anyway, guys the rumors around Ms. Drer like freaked me out since I was a kid just 'cause... I mean she lived right over there, it's weird, you know? The only house across the street, Paige. Uh, literally, the one right across the street to mine. Oh look... I put these... What did you do? Let me out. Sorry. What the fuck? Oh, Mad. Why did you put ash in my hair? No, I didn't. What? Sorries. Jess. You know what? We should go over there. Yo, we should go over there. Okay, that's a real good idea. Yo, Taylor. And do what? We should to go to the house. No, forget about it. Someone bought that house? Yeah, no, I saw the moving truck yesterday, no bullshit. Are you kidding me? Yeah, your mom told me like it's a two-person family. It's like a dad and his daughter. She's in high school. She said her name was Julie. Oh, Julie. Hi, Julie. I love my Julie. Julie. That's a pretty name. Julie. Shit. Okay. Emma? Oh my God. Hey. Oh my God. Who is it? Is that your sister? Her name is Lilly. Lilly. Hi, Lilly. Yo, yo, look at me. Why does your dad have this shit? It's okay, it's okay. - Oh, what you gonna do? - Madison, Madison, please. Yo, try me, bitch. Try me back. Oh my God. I'm sorry. Idiot. Don't mess with this type of shit, okay? It's not fuckin' loaded. My dad has a gun. Wait, that's mine. I left it in there. No, don't... Don't touch it again. Madison. Madison! Leave her, be quiet! Leave her! Stop, stop, stop give it to me. This is not loaded, you guys are so dramatic. Jesus Christ. What are you doing? Can you stop, seriously? It's not funny, though. It's not... I don't care if it's loaded or not. Ugh. She's a little kid, okay? Why did you do this? So, were you scared? You suck. You guys are so... Like... Were you scared? No. You weren't scared? I wasn't scared. Are you sure? Oh my God, just make out already. Just get it over with it. No stop. Please, can you move? That's so gross. Come on, just stop. Okay, guys, let her sit down. Can you move? Sorry. Sor... Emma. Sorry. Are you okay? Mhmm? Oh yeah. Yeah? Like my chest hurts actually. I... I can't leave my friend there. Is there still ash in my hair? No, you're good. No, you're okay. It's kinda like dandruff. Oh, I'm gonna like die before I turn 21. Right? I should have a gun. I wonder what's she like. Julie? Yeah. What? Like don't you wonder what Julie's like? Yeah, Julie's probably either super smart or some nasty whore or what? Probably a nasty whore. Fuck, do you guys know where my camera is? I don't care. I think I saw Julie earlier today actually. - Really? - Yeah. How do you know it's her? Did you already meet her or something? No, I mean, I just... I saw a girl standing right in front of that house. I mean I didn't think anything of it. What'd she look like? Um, I don't know just frail and skinny. What was she doing? Competition. - She was just... - Oh my God, sounds like a bitch. Why would she be a bitch because she's skinny? That makes no sense. She's probably not, I don't know. Why you're defending her, 'cause you're skinny? You're skinny, too. Look at Paige. You're a twig. Are you kidding me? Look at this. You're a twig. Well, was she pretty or fugly or like what? Fugly? Yeah, like give us the details, you know? - What a word! - 2007. She was... Stop. You want a sister picture? EMMA I don't know I couldn't really see her face. She was like wearing a scarf. Like a Muslim thing? Over her face? What? What's the big deal if she's a Muslim or not? Yeah, that's true. I gotta... I'm gonna have to agree with that. How can you say that? Because we're all the same. No, I mean we're not all Muslim. Look, I'm just saying that when you live with other kinds of people you're not... Hey, listen to me. It's fine, let it go. Okay? Guys, Julie's not Muslim. They don't even move here. How would you know that? The scarf over her face has gotta be something else. But why cover your face? To hide something. Maybe she has pimples. She a mysterious case of warts. Hmm. There is something in my eye. There aren't any cars in the driveway and there weren't when I got here either. So? Maybe no one's home. No, there's clearly a light on, Paige, okay? And the house was totally dead when I got here. So someone's there, 'cause someone turned it on. Maybe it's Julie. Holy shit. Just saying. You think she's alone? That's what I'm trying to figure out. Oh, this feels so nice. When you saw the moving truck, did you notice if there were cars in the driveway? Um yeah, there were... there was a Jeep I think, but only one, that's all I saw. Why? So what... what? Okay, and then um, Emma, like when you saw Julie, was that Jeep in the driveway? What are you trying to figure out? Just let her think, Paige, let her think. No, I don't think so, no. No. No? How do you know for sure? Well, I when saw Julie, she was standing in the driveway, so... Okay, so... So what? The Jeep was probably her dad's... It was there earlier. Okay. And then when she saw Julie, it was gone. So I think our friend Julie is home alone. Oh. So? I don't know, you guys, I just I agree I think like... No. We should probably go over there. Yes, bitch, yes please. And say hello. No, Taylor, you know you wanna leave the house. Don't give me that face, stop, you want to go. What are you gonna do? What do you mean? We can go and prank her, dude, it's the last weekend before school starts. What if she tells? What is she gonna say? She's never even met us before. Oh! Besides we could disguise ourselves! Do you still have those things from the thingy? What are you doing? Wait, what are you doing? No, no, no. You have the things from the thing? She doesn't know. She does not herself. Yeah, the masks that we... Yeah, I don't. The masks? Yeah, the ones that light up. Oh my God, yes, it's the perfect prank. Yeah, they're in my room. Oh my... that is... that'll be epic. How can we not do it? Yo, we can go in and scare the shit out of her. Guys, this is crazy. Who the fuck cares? You guys, it's a ridiculous idea. And the best part of this whole thing... It's gonna be so fun. Is that Emma said she knows where the key is. So no one will ever guess how we got over there. No, I mean... You don't... Does she know where the key is? No, no, I mean, yeah, I... I saw the key. I saw the key, I don't remember where I put it though. I don't even remember where I put it. Chill, chill out, it's fine. Just why wouldn't you... Hey, hey, look at me, look at me. Why wouldn't you tell me where the key is? Yeah, that's crow. What, you don't trust me or something? Because she just moved here and you're talking about breaking into her house to prank her, that's ridiculous. - Who cares? - Emma! She just moved here, she doesn't even know anybody. Exactly. That's why we go. Hey, look at me. If you tell us where the key is I'll let you have your phone. You have my phone? You have her phone? You asshole! What is wrong with you? Do you wanna know why? It's 'cause dad... She really is a skinny bitch. Can you not say that in front of my sister, please. Oh sorry. Hey, hey, look, I'll let you have your phone back, okay? I mean only for a little, but you'll have it. Oh, and we'll delete the video that we took of you. Yes! And we won't post it. Consider it already gone. Consider it dead, deceased from the internet. Never even happened. If I give you the key, will you guys be nice to her after you prank her? Of... who do you think you're talking to? Of course. I mean can we... I'll make sure of it, I promise. Can we maybe invite her back over here after? Yes. Yeah, we can play with Lil... Oh no, you need to be asleep. Yeah, look how small her nose is, so cute. Go back to sleep. Yeah, what is wrong with you, perfect features ass. You guys, I can't even... 'Cause the key isn't even up here, it's downstairs, so I can't get it. Okay, just... just do it, but be careful. You have to promise me, hey, you have to promise me you'll be careful. Yeah, yeah, okay, fine, fine. Just wait here. Oh Taylor, can you please watch... Can you watch Lilly? Yeah, of course I can. You wanna come with us? Can you watch... can you watch over her please? Of course, I will. And we haven't even planned the plan. Seriously, be really silent, because he's not gonna kill you, he's gonna kill me. He doesn't care about you, okay? Okay, cool. Just do it, it'll be fine. Just be, just be silent, that's all you have to do. Guys! She's gonna open the door, she's gonna open the door. Quiet. She's gonna open the door. Go, go, go. Hey, be quiet, guys. Will you just... I'd appreciate it. Look, the door's open, you guys, shut up. Uncle Vince? Taylor? Taylor? Lilly? Are you guys messing with me again? Do you want the key or not? Oh my! Must be scared as hell? You should've seen your face. At least she's not gasping for air this time. Stop. Stop! God! No asthma... Boo! Yeah, woohoo! We got her. Give it... give it to me. Yes! Good job, good job. It's okay, it's okay, come on. Stop. Eat your pranker right here. Julie's nightmare. Okay did you get the key to house? We definitely scared you. You guys are gonna be nice to her after, right? Yes, yes, yes, yes, we are. We already told you. We are going to invite her back? Yes. Emma, the key? Ahhhh. But hey, I have to put it back when we're through. Yeah. Who wants it? Who wants it? Okay, I want it. Oh no, where'd it go? Alright, alright. Okay, you guys, seriously you ready? - I'm ready. - Are you ready? I can't believe we're really doing this. You coming, too? Oh no, I'm staying here with Lilly. - Are you kidding me? - I'll go! - No. - No, no, no, no. Oh, then why don't you come? No, please let her come. You have to go back to bed, she has to go back to bed. My baby, no. I know, don't worry, it'll be fine. So what are we doing again? Oh my God. Are you serious, Paige? Why do you ask the same questions over and over? It's really simple, okay. We just go over there, find Julie wherever her ass is, sneak up on her... And then we just get the hell outta there as fast as we can. Wait, I thought that you were gonna invite her back after? Emma, Emma, Emma. We're already through, okay? We're doing it. So let's just... Guys, so we run up the street. And if she follows, then we split up and go in opposite directions until we lose her, got it? Hey, hey, hey! She can't know we came from this house, I'm serious, you guys. Yeah, so no one go out the front door, okay? And then we'll meet up by the pool and then come back inside together. We gotta ditch the masks. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Oh yeah. Hey, Maddy. I don't like being touched on my shoulder. Just come here, come here. What? You guys have to remember, once we get downstairs, no talking. Yes. Until we get outside. I'm serious, okay? But otherwise, have a little fun. It's gonna be fine. We'll have a good time. We'll have a good time. Please take care of my camera for me, it's my most prized possession. Okay, please. Alright, guys, try and stick together. Picture, picture of us. Wait, she's gonna take a picture. Picture of us, picture of us. She's gonna take a picture. Oh hold on, yas. Okay. Say, "Boo". MADISON, JESS AND PAIGE: Boo! Bleh! Okay, okay. Did you get it? Okay, good. Take care of that shit, okay? Yeah, okay. Alright, then. Bye, give me... give me... give me a hug. Alright. Oh yeah. You guys, you stupid... We'll be back, okay. Promise, okay, go. Go, go. Of course, of course, two seconds. It'll be fun, it'll be fun. Goodbye, goodbye. Are they monsters? Tonight they are. But I wanna go with them. No, you don't. I'm not afraid. Yeah, that's because you're in here with me. I miss daddy. Yeah me too. Why don't you stay in my room? Because I want you to get some sleep. Please. I want you to... I want you to sleep well, okay? Can we play... can we play a game? Okay, what game? I love you. Okay. The first elevator said stop The second elevator said stop The third elevator said Keep on going till your hands get hot And hot And hot And freeze. And go, and go, and... And freeze! And then go, and then go. And go, and go, then stop. Look! Hi! Um, okay, it's time for bed. What no, time for bed. Oh. Come on. I wanna stay up till midnight. Good night. Night. I love you. I love you, too. You want me to leave the light on? Yeah. Okay. What's going on? What happened? We should've never gone over there. Where is everybody? Someone's wat... someone's watching me. He... I... uh, um... Only... only two... two others made it to Julie's room, but I couldn't tell who was who. Everyone was... everyone was wearing masks. And... Are you messing with me again? What? I wanna go home. I wanna go home. Ridiculous. What? Did you... did you open the door to Lilly's room? Where'd... where'd she go? Did you put this here? No, no. Uh did... did you? This seriously better not be another joke. No, it's not. It's not. Okay um... um, you said there were only two other people in the house with you? Uh, Jess and... and... and someone. Taylor? I... I... I don't know. I... I only heard Jess. Do we have to talk about this? No, it's... it's... it's fine. Taylor probably just realized what time it was and she went to the airport to go pick up her mom and she probably took Lilly with her. She's... she's always late. Yeah. Um, can you... uh can you try calling, can you try calling Jess? Taylor, if you were gonna take Lilly with you to the airport, you should have told me, I seriously almost had a heart attack! Can you just call me back, okay? My phone died. No one answers their phone anymore. Voicemail. Um, okay, can you try calling Madison? Madison? Madison? Madison? Madison? Madison? Oh my God! Like Jesus Christ! It's just a joke! Where were you? What are you talking about? I was the first person to get here. Where's everybody else? We're the... we're the only ones that came back. Well, no, Taylor bailed to pick up her mom, so yeah. See, I told you. You guys are absolutely ridiculous. But where... where is Jess? How the fuck am I supposed to know? Isn't she here? No, she's... she's missing. She's not missing, she's probably trying to scare you. Well, she's doing a good job. Don't you worry, she'll be here. Where are you going? Emma, what are you doing? Hey, hey! No. Emma! I'm just... I'm really sick and tired of all these pranks. Oh fuck. Dude, no one is pranking you now. What are you talking about? I'm telling the truth. I don't believe anything that you guys say anymore. Dude, what are you... Just go home. We can't leave, because Jess... Jess' not here. Can you please open the door? Once we find Jess, we will leave, okay? Do you understand what we're saying? Can you please open the door? Jess always sticks with me, this is really unlike for her to not be here right now. Can you open the door? You, hello? Your fucking uncle is downstairs. Paige, why are you crying? Can you get over it? Stop, stop! Just stop! Stop crying. Hey, open the door. Open the... Are you fucking with me right now? Please, please. Are you joking? Open the fucking door. Do you want me to get your uncle? Do you want me to get your uncle? That's what I fucking thought. Jesus Christ. What the fuck is the matter with you? Let's just leave, I... I wanna go home. No, we can't leave, okay? Jess drove us here and her car is still parked right there. So we have to wait until she gets back. She's not coming back, because something happened to her - in that room! - Like what? Like what, Paige? I don't want to talk about it! I don't want to think about it! What happened? You guys, what happened at Julie's? How the fuck am I supposed to know, I left. It... it was dark, but it was like she was having a seizure. What? You didn't hear her? No! I told you, I left. Besides, mission accomplished. You... you all tried to shit with me, get serious. No, it was awful. It didn't even sound like a person. Oh my God, you've seen pranks on YouTube before. That's what happens. - No, not like that. - It's just what happens. - Not like that, not like that. - Yes, like that! Okay, okay, if you thought that she was having a seizure, why didn't you stay and help her? You wouldn't have stayed. If you saw what I saw, I guarantee you wouldn't have stayed. - What did you see? - You would have ran, too! What did you see, Paige? What'd you see? What do you mean? You said we wouldn't have stayed if we saw what you saw. It was her, it was... And there was wrapped around her face? Something was wrong with her! Hey, where is Jess? What happened to Jess? She... she... she went down she. She went down, Paige? She went down? Where? It was like she fell through the floor. Where did she go? But there was no sound, there was no anything! It was down through, just down! Oh my God, you are hysterical. - You didn't see it? - Look at me right now! Guys, okay. Are you... just... everybody just needs to calm down, okay? - Are you sure that Jess... - Are you kidding me? Are you sure that Jess isn't just messing with you and she didn't just go to the airport with Taylor and Lilly? What are you talking about? You said that Taylor left for the airport. Lilly wasn't with her. What? Yeah, Taylor left for the airport, but Lilly wasn't with her. Do you not know where your sister is? No, she said that she wanted to go with you guys. Wow, great job. Sister of the year goes to Emma! She said that she wanted to go with you guys! Well, she didn't. What, she got out on her own? I don't know, she might, maybe. Jesus, to think with your parents gone, you'll be... Will you shut up, God! Oh, she's feisty. Haven't seen this side of you. Just everybody needs to just shut up and calm down, okay? She... she's probably just out back. I mean it's sort of Uncle Vince's basement. She like to... she likes to play there sometimes, so... Good, yes, that's where she is. How do we know he's out there? Because he's just passed out on the couch. Uh, no, he's not. What are you talking about? I checked, he's not there. I walked through the front door when I came back and he wasn't on the couch. You can't even see the front of the couch when you come through the front door. Well, I did, because I checked, like I just said. What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm calling Jess. We tried that, she's not answering. Well, she's always answering me. Oh God. She's supposed to be with me right now. She said that she was behind me, so I need to know. Watch, she is going to answer. Come on, Jess. See, I fucking told you. Jess? Maddy! Jess, are you okay? Jess, can you see me? Jess, I'm at window, I'm at the window. Can you see me? Maddy! Where are you? You left me. What... what are you doing? You! Jess? No! Jess, what's wrong? Come on, you gotta be... No, don't call her back, don't call her back! I'm calling her back. Maddy, please. Okay, um, so... Here's what's gonna happen, you're gonna go find your sister, I'm gonna go find Jess, because she never fucking freaks out like that, so I'm gonna go get her, okay? No, we are... Maddy, you can't go. You can't go. What's fucking wrong with the door? Okay, okay. Just shut up, okay? Just fucking come with me, just shut your mouth. I don't want your uncle to come. Are you coming? Let's go. Oh, but. Come on, come on. Okay, I already told you, you're gonna get your sister, I'm gonna get Jess. Everything is gonna be fine. You call me, I'll answer, okay, I swear. Yes, I have to. You're not gonna go. It's okay, you stupid thing. Be careful. I will, okay? Okay. It's okay, come on. It's okay. Lilly. Lilly. Hey. Hey. You okay? Are you okay? Lilly. Lilly, if you're hiding, you need to come out right now, this isn't funny. Lilly? Lilly! Lilly. Lilly! Lilly. What are you waiting for? Why don't you come get me? What the hell are you waiting for? Damn. Fuck! Hey. You alright? What are you doing? Where's um... Where's Taylor, my daughter, where is she? Um, uh, she went to the airport to pick up Aunt Emily. Okay, good. Good, that's good. That's good. Things are always better when she's here. And there's no one else in the house? Huh, just you and Lilly, right? It's got a hair-trigger, it's why uh, shit! The safety's off. One time I reached for it wrong, it was years ago. I reached for it wrong and the damn thing went off. Shot straight out the window. It was right out the fucking window. I thought to myself "Okay, alright, mistake made." And the cops show up at the door. He was just a little kid. Not even 10 years old, I don't think. Have uh... have you seen have you seen Lilly anywhere? No. You don't think? Emma. Emma, look at me. You don't think I'm capable of something like that? Of hurting some... someone like Lilly or you? I know, I know how I look when I drink to you. This is... this is just... this is just a reminder reminder of what I did. And what I'm waiting for. Waiting? Oh yeah, yeah, waiting. Something always comes to make you pay. Except me. Except me, it doesn't seem wanna come get me. I remember stuff. Lilly? Lilly? Lilly? Lilly? Paige? Paige? Lilly? She's not here. You should never have given us that key. Um, Paige, your phone's ringing. It's Madison's landline. Do you want me to answer it? Nobody is coming back. Hello. Hi, Mrs. Bury. Oh, no, this is um, Emma. I'm... I'm Taylor's cousin. Um, yeah, I think the girls are still up. Yeah, they're still up. Uh, Madison's in the bathroom. Wait, she called you? Wait, what did she say? That's funny. I mean she's funny to have said that. Yeah. Well, I'll have her call you back as soon as she gets out of the bathroom. Paige. Um, Paige, that was Madison's mom, she said that... she said that Madison left her a message saying goodbye. Paige? It is... it's like the walls are growing in height. Paige, she said that she that Ms. Drer is coming after us for what we did to that girl. And that we're all gonna die tonight. Like I'm... I'm sinking. Paige, she didn't think it sounded like a joke. So dark. Paige, how does her mom know about Ms. Drer anyway? Paige? Can you... Can you please just tell me if this is all just a joke and that you're just doing this to make me feel even more like a loser than I already do, please Paige. Paige? Paige, can you hear me? Paige? Paige? Paige? Paige? Uh. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice... You said that you would answer the phone! Madison, you said that you would pick up the phone, this is not funny anymore. Hello? Emma? Lilly? I'm scared, I can't see! Um, did you... did you go to the neighbor's house to find the other girls? Yes, but I can't get out! Is Madison there with you? She left me. She left you? Come get me! Okay, Lilly, um, I need you to listen to me really carefully, okay? Okay, um, sometimes... sometimes people like to play pranks on other people. And sometimes it's funny and sometimes it's not funny. And right now, it's really not funny, Lilly. So I need you to tell me if the girls are telling you what to say to me? No. Okay, because I don't understand how you have Madison's phone. She dropped it. Okay, but why didn't she pick it up? She left! Okay, why would she leave you? Please come get me! Tell me why would she leave you? Okay, where did Madison go, Lilly? Through the floor. Lilly? Lilly? Yes, yes, I'm right here, okay? Let go off my hand. Wait, who... who is it? Is it one of the girls? No, I can't see who! Lilly, what is she saying? She says it's all your fault. Um Lilly, can you give her the phone right now? Lilly? Lilly Emina Carter! Lilly! Julie. Um, I'm... I'm your neighbor. I'm not trying to scare you or anything, I... I just think my little sister might have come in here. Julie? Julie? Julie? Julie, are you okay? Julie? Shit. Shit! Julie? Julie, are you okay? You okay? Lilly! Lilly, if you're here, we need to leave right now! Julie! Thought I put some lights on when I left. Alright Julie, dad's gonna be pissed off. Lilly. Lilly? Emma. You need to be really, really quiet, okay? Because we're gonna run out of here right now, okay? Okay? It's locked. Um, okay, are there any other doors down there? I didn't go down there. Oh my. I'm checking the fuse box in the basement. Stay quiet Lilly? Let's go. Emma, come on, I don't wanna be here. I'm leaving. Emma, come on. Okay, okay, okay. Hey, hey! What are you doing in my house? Come... come here! Hold my hand, come on. Upstairs! Go upstairs and go to bed right now! Lilly, go upstairs and go to bed right now! Go to bed, Lilly, now! Uncle Vince! Uncle Vince, I really need your help. Uncle Vince! Okay. Taylor?! Ah finally! What the... what hell is going on over there? And Emma, what was that message? I don't have Lilly, okay? Taylor, when are you coming home? I tried to call Jess but... Taylor, when are you coming home? Shit, I'm at the airport. I bailed really quick, sorry. Um, what is everything okay? Okay, how long until you can get here? How long until you can get here? I don't know, probably like 45 minutes, I'm waiting for mom now. Why? No, no, that's too long, that's too long. That's too long. Emma... Emma, you're scaring me. What... what's happening? Wait, this is all my fault. This is all my fault. This is all my fault. Wait, wait... hey wait, wait, wait, slow down. What... what's your fault? Emma? Emma? Julie's dead. What? She was a burn victim or something. I think that she had a weak heart. Okay, is this... is this... is this a joke? Are you? Emma, is this a joke? Taylor, two dead girls. Oh, is this what this is about? Oh my... Listen to me, listen to me right now! Shannon committed suicide, so you need to stop it, okay? You need to stop it! Yeah, but I was so awful to her, I was so terrible to her. No, Emma, stop it. And I shouldn't have treated her like tha, Taylor. No, I should not have treated her like that. Just let it go, E! Come on. Fuck. Taylor, her dad saw me. They're gonna find me and... I don't... Taylor, I found a pic... I found a picture. I found a picture of Shannon in Julie's basement. What? That doesn't make any sense, you know that, right? I know! You are... I know. Okay, okay. Okay, look, you can't tell anyone that you... you or any of my friends went over there tonight. You know that, right? No one can know, Emma. They're going to know, Taylor. They're going to know. God Emma, just work with me, please! I should never have given them that key. I should have protected her. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, where... where is everyone? Where's Maddy? Where's... where's Jess? Where's Paige? I think... I think that Ms. Drer took them because of what they did to Julie. Oh, oh my God. She's dead, Emma! This is... this is crazy. Fucking crazy! Um, okay. Um, Emma, I see mom. So hey, listen to me, I'm gonna pick her up and I'm driving straight home, I promise so just... No, Taylor. No, hey, hey, hey, hey, it's okay. Just go to bed and everything is gonna be okay. No, no, no, Taylor. Taylor, please don't hang up. - I'm gonna make everything okay. - Taylor don't hang up the phone. - It's gonna be fine. - Taylor. Please. I have to go, I'm sorry. I have to. Hey mom! Taylor, Taylor, please. Taylor! Taylor! Lilly, Lilly! You okay? Are you okay? Is that lady out there? You saw her? Is she mad at me for going over there? No, this has nothing to do with you, okay, she is just... She was just using you to... to know me. Does she know who you are now? Listen, I know that things have been hard, okay, but we're in a safe place now, okay? And I know that Uncle Vince is scary, but Aunty loves him and he's okay, okay? I need you to make me a promise. And it's not always gonna be easy to keep. What is it? Just be good to people. No matter what. I love you. I love you, too. I need to go, okay? Okay. I have to go, okay? I love you. Me too. Shannon, I'm sorry. Mom.
