Thanks, Parker. It'll wear off. Yeah. No, it won't. The first day of high school is the most freaking, awkward day of your life. That's undisputed. There's awkward, and then there's this. You just gotta let people get used to the new normal. I don't think normal's going to happen. Okay, that came out completely wrong. I just meant that eventually everybody's gonna move on. Yeah, no, I know what you meant. I'm sure you're right. It's just so sad and so awful. And nobody knows what to say. Yeah, I know, I know. Zoe was the most freakin' perfect human being that has ever seemed to... Oh, my God, there he is. Have you talked to him? I mean, since it happened? His mom put him in a facility. Suicide watch and everything. Full-on straightjacket, padded walls. It's so, so sad. He was crazy about her. You know he torched his own car, right? His Mustang? Like the day after the police gave it back to him, soaked it in gasoline, threw in a match. And why the hell not, right? I mean, it's not like he can drive it anymore. Who's gonna buy it from him? Maybe some twisted freak show. Marc! Oh, my God, Marc. Carley, come on. Let's go to the bathroom. Marc, I knew it wasn't you. I swear to God, okay? What'd you take, Carley? Carley, what'd you take?

My parents said they'd help me with the down payment. But I'd still have to get a job. Oh, my God, that's it. That's Marc's new car. His Mustang was way cooler. Why is he parked all the way out here? Probably 'cause people are so interested in him. He should get the hell out of this town after graduation, go somewhere where he won't be known as the dead girl's boyfriend. Oh, crap. I can't believe I said that. I am so sorry. Oh, my God. Hey, what are you doing? Stop it, Echo! That is not funny! ECHO: Do you realize what this means? Honestly, no. We looked everywhere for this. The police were desperate to find it, and guess who's had it this whole time? So he didn't want everybody reading Zoe's diary. I mean, it's probably all about him. Exactly.

We let her out of this room, where's she gonna go? Straight to the cops. And when that happens, and they make that connection between that psycho killer and our site, they'll have us for child porn and trafficking and whatever it is when you help a murderer. Dude, you don't know what you're fucking talking about! I do because I looked it up. It's called "accessory to murder." [ECHO SHRIEKS] [TOM GROANS] The bitch bit me. We're all fucked! No. We'll wait till it's dark, then we take them out. I know a place. What are you talking about? Carley's not gonna be a problem. I've got her under control. Okay, so what about her? You sold her sister to a killer, man. You think she's gonna let that stand? I swear to God I didn't know. Stop! There's only one way to clean this up. I'll do it if you can't. Will you stop talking like you're in a gangster movie! I'm just saying what we both know. Half of Lincoln Carter High School saw her get into my car after school, you fucking moron! What if we let 'em go? Twenty years, man. How do we get out? All right, my brother-in-law lives in Vegas. All right, we move the whole setup there. We could be up and running in three, maybe four days. Okay, so what about them? Do you know how quickly the cops can be all over this place? Not until 24 hours until a person's reported missing. Really? I'm pretty sure. Well, would you look it up? It's kinda important! Fine! But if I'm right, we're gonna need those 24 hours. You handle it. And I don't ever wanna know how. And my car? It's fucked. I need a truck for the gear. [WHIMPERING] [STRAINING] [POUNDING] [GRUNTING] [GASPING] Carley, Carley. Carley, I need you. I need you to wake up, Carley. Come on, Carley, Carley, Carley.
