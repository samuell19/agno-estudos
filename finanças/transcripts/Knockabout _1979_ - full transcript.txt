Boss, good fortune to your business! Some good-luck money, please. Good-luck money? I'm not in luck. I'm unlucky to see you, you scum! Go away! There was no need to be grumpy, was there? Boss's son, if you can please... ...cash this for me. Cash for what? This isn't enough to pay for a tiny tooth filling. What tooth? A hippo tooth or an elephant's tusk? Please, give me what you think it's worth. Don't blow it away. Please. Wait a minute. Here. Thank you. You jerk! Who are you? How do you know I'm Yu Ju-Ke? What? Are you really? Good! I just returned from abroad. Your uncle... - Yu An-Ku? - No, your uncle, not mine. Correct, my uncle's name is Yu An-Ku. Tell me what you want. Your uncle asked me to bring you a letter and a package. Here. Take a look. Boss's son! I can't read. Can you please see what it's about? To Mr. Yu Ju-Ke. My dear nephew Yu Ju-Ke, your uncle has asked Chun Sing Ma... to bring you 20 ounces of gold from the sale of the house. Please keep it. Stay healthy. From your uncle. 4th of June. Great. Please cash this. Yes. - This is for you. - Thank you. It's over 28 ounces! The fool thought it was only 20 ounces. What a big profit! Boss's son, does the gold weigh enough? Not really. It's slightly less. But as we're neighbours I'll cash it for you. Six coins per ounce, so it's 120 coins altogether. Take it. I'm writing you a receipt, so things are clear and formal. Here. Someone just brings me money. How lucky can I be? - Aren't you going to count the money? - I trust you. Let's go to the restaurant I can't. I have to watch the shop. I'm going to the Fortune Restaurant. Join me when you're free. I know you'll come. What a lamb! Wei, stop staring at women. Get back to work! From now on, I can date women as well. How come? A lamb happily gave me eight ounces earlier. Really? The gold weighed 28 ounces, but I only paid him for 20. I made a huge profit! - Where's the gold? - Come. Here it is, father. You're the lamb! One day you'll lose my entire fortune! The gold is fake! So now you're the lamb. Don't worry. He said he's at the Fortune Restaurant. We'll go and get him. That was too easy. That's him. What took you so long? Take a seat. Waiter! You scum! You can take a seat in prison! Sit down and have some tea. We'll see about that. How brazen, using fake gold to get cash! Not as brazen as your voice. Don't be so arrogant! Beat him up! What's going on? Good timing, Captain. This scum used a fake piece of gold to cheat us out of 20 ounces. I gave you real gold. Anyone can tell this is fake. But the one I gave you wasn't fake. Shut up! How can you prove your gold wasn't fake? My gold wasn't as big as this one. How much did your gold weigh? My uncle asked Chun Sing Ma to bring the gold from abroad for me. The gold was 20 ounces. Here's the letter. Here's the receipt from the boss's son. - Men, bring in the scales. - Yes, Captain. The gold. - How much does your gold weigh? - 20 ounces. It's more than 20 ounces. It's over 28 ounces. See? My gold's not as heavy as this one. Mine isn't that heavy. If this piece of gold was really mine, it would've been worth more. Captain, I'll show you that he gave me cash for 20 ounces of gold. So, the coins are fake! Woe is me! Uncle, the money you slaved for has all been swindled by these two! Shut up! Fried rice cake. They're fried rice cakes. Shut up. You two are real villains. Don't shoot! They didn't mean it and they'll pay me back. Pay it back! - Father, are we paying him back? - Yes, we are. Kid, with Captain Baldy around no one will take advantage of you. White Hair, never do this again on my turf. Understand? Younger brother, that was so easy. As I expected. Using both of our brains has earned us two bags of money. We might as well divide the money now. Put your hat down, then. - What was that noise? - The weather-forecast guy. - Seriously, what was that noise? - He said it's going to rain soon. Hurry! One for me, one for you. One for you. That's fair, isn't it? Fair. I trust you. How about I take your bag and you take mine? It doesn't matter. They're the same. Do you think I'm blind? Your bag is much bigger. That's because I've inherited bags under my eyes. I'm older. If it's hereditary, I should get the bigger one. You don't have to see me off. Here. It's here. Where's it gone? How could it just disappear? It was my fault. Your performance was great, and as the older brother, I'll just take the small one. It was your idea. I should take the small one. - I'll have the small one. - I should have it. - Only the small bag is left. - We'll lose that too if we keep fighting. - We've been lucky today. - Let's gamble. - Place your bets. - You're the dealer? I'll bet it all. You can't just point, you have to pay. This is a casino. You may get away with that in a whorehouse. I have money. Don't I look as if I'd have money? Place your bets. Here, throw the dice. Good luck to us! Place your bets. Hands off the table. Are you ready now? Pay up, please. Wait a moment! Show us your money first. No problem. it'll take time to count. See? We're got nothing to hide. There's no need to count it. Good! Take the money back. You must like being beaten up. Get them. Go to hell! Get him! Here I am! Go to hell! Enough is enough. I won't go easy on you. - I'll use the Choi technique on you. - And I'll teach you a lesson. I'll use "through, throw, hang, blow, stab". Through... throw... hang... blow... stab. Through, throw, hang, blow, stab. Hang, blow, stab. Hang, blow, stab. Through, throw, hang, blow, stab. - You know the Choi technique too? - Yes. I won't hit my fellow colleagues. - You said you wouldn't hit me! - But hitting and kicking are different. Be quick. Great! Stop! Stop it, stop it! Big brothers, don't hit me. We're sorry. You two brats dare to cheat. Please stop. it was my fault, all my fault. I told him not to do it, but he said it was all right. I'm mad at him too. I told you not to, but you said it was all right. Don't do it again! - What? - Shut up! It's my fault, it's my fault! He admits it was his fault. And I was wrong too. If this ever happens again, your ribs will be crushed one by one. - Throw them out! - Please throw us out. Thank you. Scumbags! You won't be standing up next time. Get lost! We shouldn't have gambled. Thank goodness I'm a good actor. What should we do? Don't worry. We still have this. Father left us these as heirlooms. You wasted yours. Don't even think about it. Think of something else, then. Fresh fish. Come and buy the fresh fish. Fresh fish... You know what to do. Go over there. These are fresh fish. Fresh fish. Pick as you please. - As I please? - Of course. Well, if you say so. They're fishy and stinky. I'm not happy with them. Steamed fish, grilled fish, stuffed fish, steamed fish heads, fried fish and fish soup. Just fish? Don't you want something else? None of your business. I have a lot of fish today. Bring the basket. Here it is. Hurry up! We still need to pay for tea, towels, rice, tips and labour. We have no mon Don't worry about it. We now have a lot of dishes. Just one dish is missing. - Which dish? - A lamb dish. Where is the dish? The old man behind me. Will that work? This is my heirloom! Hurry up! Be careful. Steamed buns. Fried beef with vegetables. Fried vegetables with beef. I'm sorry. That's him. Old man, he says you stole his bag. - You! - I hit the table first, not you. I hit the table, not you. Talk now! Stranger, you look respectable, but you're a thief. What does your bag look like? Have you looked for it properly? He's right. Have you looked for it properly? I don't need to look for it any more. I recognise my own bag. - Got any evidence? - Of course. My ring is wrapped in a pink cloth. It's carved with my father's name. Really? Show it to me. So this proves this is not your bag. - It isn't there. - No. When Captain Baldy is in charge, thieves are not permitted. Do it outside my territory. Understand? Go away! I understand, I understand. - Did you really put it in the bag? - Yes, and you can't find it? - It wasn't in there. - How come? I'm as good as dead. You have no idea who you're dealing with. - You dare to trick us? - Give me back the ring. Ring? There are many to be found in shops. Old man, do you want a beating? Beat him up! - Are you all right? - Yes. Go beat him up! Are you all right? Go beat him up! Can't you give me a break? Kid, my chest is not made of steel. I wonder if your arm is. How's your arm? - Don't touch me. - All right, I'll touch him. Here is your cheap ring. It's an expensive ring. Really? It's cheap now. Yes. Now I've got nothing left! Don't bother chasing him. His kung fu is excellent and you'll be beaten. What shall we do? Without it, how can we make a living? Don't worry, we'll think of a way to make the old man provide for us. We'll eat and live at his expense. We ask him to be our master and learn all his kung fu. Then we leave him, and that will be our revenge. Of course. With his kung fu, we'll never starve. We could make so much money! Master, we've been getting into fights all our lives. We've never lost any of them, however big or small, until now. Therefore we've decided that you should be our master. - You'll benefit from this. - How will I benefit? Well, we're handsome and well-behaved. Not. We're also kind and healthy. We don't have any bad habits. Then you can work in a shop. We'd like to work for you. So that if you're sick and unwell... ...we can look after you. But I can't look after you if anything happens to you. Look at you. You're both weak. Of course we're not. I've learnt kung fu all my life and I know all the move. The Choi technique: "through, throw, hang, blow, stab". Through... throw... hang... blow... stab. The Hung technique: "lift, flow, force, straight, part". Lift... flow... force... straight... part. Also Wing Chun: "tie, strap, slap, elbow, drop." Tie... strap... slap... elbow... drop. And the Shun technique: "point, stomp, jump, shake, dash." Point... stomp... jump... shake... dash. Really? So why do you want to learn from me? Master, I've never learnt kung fu. Teach me. - Not even a bit? - Yes, yes. That'd be even harder. That's not true. I watched him learning kung fu and I learnt a lot. If you teach me your kung fu, I'll immortalise it when you're dead. You'll be stinking infamous! Why didn't you put in a good word for me? You said things people don't like to hear. He won't take you on. - You must massage his ego. - If I knew how, I could be a masseur. Everyone knows that's my problem. Catch him up! Boatman, please come over here. Coming. Paddle quicker! Hurry up! Sir, the water is too shallow. Please wade to me. Master, one wrong step and you could drown. I'll handle this. You're stronger than me. Lay down for Master to cross over. - You're stronger. - No, you're stronger. Let's decide in the usual way. I told you you'd lose. Be careful of me. - Be careful. - You seem strong enough. Hang onto it. Be quick. He's strong enough to support you. Please. - You've never been so polite. - Hurry up! As I said, you're strong. Get on the boat. I can't hold on much longer. - Don't be modest. You can hang on. - I can't. Hurry up! Show the old man what you've got so he'll accept you. I can't hold on any longer! Really? I'll get on the boat then. Thank you very much. - How many? - Are you blind? - Three. - One to sit, two to stand. Come over here, please. Please sit down. What would you like to eat? - Steamed... - ...chicken. - Fried beef... - ...with vegetables. - Fried seafood... - ...with bean sprouts. - And one bowl of rice. - Hurry up. Please. Waiter, two more bowls of rice please. Sit down. Here they are. What are you waiting for? Go ahead. That's more like it. Delicious! Not bad. - No need to be polite. - No worries. - Are you full now? - Yes. How about you, Master? More or less. Waiter, the bill, please. Three fens and six, please. Pay over there. Charge three fens and six. Let me carry it for you, Master. Please. He can train on his leg work, but I have to train with this. Never mind. You don't think this is useful? I didn't say that. You did. Little Boo, hold this for me. - Hit me. - Yes. What do you think? - You are learning "womanly fist". - Womanly fist? - You are learning "lady leg". - Lady leg? - Train hard. - Yes. Let me steal the technique. Master! You've mastered good kung fu. Ordinary people are no match for you. - Train hard. - Of course. - I'm going to the restaurant. - See you. What? - Did you hear that? - Yes. Master asked us to train hard. Master said ordinary people are no match for us. - Are you thinking what I think you are? - Don't you want to? Yes. But where are the ordinary people? No worries. Come with me. Cheap, fresh vegetables! Buy them here! Who's ordinary among all these people? Why ask me? I don't know. Let's check them out. Get out of the way. Sort that out. Out of the way! Get your fresh vegetables here! Money, please. How come? I gave you money only a few days ago. My boss lost some money a few days ago. His bad luck is your bad luck - That's bullying! - So what? Get lost! You have to pay! - No! - Destroy the stall. Who sent you? - Thank you. - It's a pleasure. - Who are you? - We're ordinary people. What is it? - You heard that? - Ordinary people. We've found them. Fight them. I'm fantastic! Stop that. - Where did you learn that? - From you. Who's tougher, you or us? You are. You are. - Who'll pay for the broken things? - I will, I will. - Is that enough? - Yes. Lady, this is to compensate you. Yes, please! Thank you! - Master is right. - Ordinary people are no match for us. - Brothers, your kung fu is excellent. - It can be better. I'd like to... - There's no need. - We already have some. - Where should we go now? - Follow me. Place your bets. Ready. Hands off the table. Place your bets. Ready. Hands off the table. The more you bet, the more you win. Place your bets. It'll be four. Place your bets. Ready. Hands off the table. Open. The result is four. Place your bets. - Will it work? - Sure. Place your bets. The more you bet, the more you win. - What are you doing? - Just want to play a couple. Place your bets. - It's you again, fat beggar. - It's weather-forecast time. This will be four again. Place your bets. Did you bet on one? Bet on four. Open. It'll be four. Sorry. I had too much phlegm in my throat. The result is one. Hard luck. Place your bets. Bet on this game. The more you bet, the more you win. Open. It'll be two. You're finished. This is your button. It isn't. Mine are different, and there are more in his other hand. You're cheating again! Wait. There's no hurry. I'll take care of this. Everybody, the casino is now closed for a happy event. Please leave. Check out what's happening. - I bet odd numbers. How about you? - Then I'll bet even. You bastards again! Crush them! Four of them. One, two, three... Still four of them. No need to count. It's an even number. Told you you'd lose. Hey, come on. - Not yet. - Why? Come on up. Take your time. Damn, look what you've done! You should've crouched lower! I'll crouch lower next time. Give me the money. Come on, hand it over. Where's the money? That damn fat beggar! This one is for you, and this one is for you... Would you steal from beggars? I'll sue you! You can all go home now. - Fat beggar, you've tricked us too often. - We're going to cook your goose. You're going to cook me a goose? I'd be happy enough with a chicken. - Beat him up. - After you. I'll crush you. Help me! Hurry! All right. Sorry. - Why did you hit him? - I'll hit you! I told you not to hit him. Now he's hitting you back. Go to hell! - He hit you again. Let me help. - Thank you. I'll support you. Damn it, Little Boo's hitting me all the time! Finally! Big Boo, this is our chance! Come on! - Hurry up. - Hurry up! You're right, this is my chance. - Why did you keep hitting me? - He did, didn't he? - Beat him up. - After you. Have you gone mad? You can keep the goose. I don't want it. It was your fault! Who are you? Where is Jia Wu Dao? - You're after our master? - We don't know. So he even accepted two pupils. Let me see what he's taught you. Kid, your kung fu isn't bad at all. It can be better, old man. - Seven Dwarves. - What is it, Snow White? The old fox has trained them well at Womanly Fist and Lady Leg. Separate them. This guy looks like your aunt! - Who is my aunt to you? - Your aunt is... my aunt. Well, I'm your mother! One to one, you're no match for us. Tell your master he'll find us at the Chun Lai inn when he returns. Have the goodness to tell us your names. How dare you ask our names? We are no ordinary people. Seven Dwarves, let's go. "No ordinary people"? No wonder we're no match for them. Master, two people came. They claimed they're no ordinary people. They said Chun something... They're waiting for you at the Chun Lai inn. They finally found me here. I've waited for them a long time. Master, who are they? - They are my enemies. - Master, how will you defeat them? "To Seven Dwarves and Snow White" Deliver this letter to them. A meeting at Little Bell forest. You two will fight Seven Dwarves and I'll take care of that feminine man. Don't let them join forces or they won't be ordinary people. If they can't fight at their best, you can win easily. It's show time. - You're so clumsy. - I'm too excited. This is great! Kick! I told you before, you're not smart enough. - He's no match for you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. At last that weight is lifted from me. Thanks for your support. It's a pleasure. - I still need to finish off something. - Yes? Go back and get changed. Meet me at Lun Kee Restaurant for a big meal. Thank you. - Go back first. - All right. Let's go. Roast pork buns. Sir, have you seen these three people? - No. - Thank you. - What would you like to drink? - Oolong tea, please. - Sir, have you seen this person? - No. Haven't we seen him before? Sir! What a coincidence. Come and join us for tea. - Sit down. - Thank you, but no. Have you seen this man? Not only have we seen him, we're learning kung fu from him. That's a good drawing. This must be Master's name: Jia Wu Dao. I was thinking the same thing. Where is he now? At home. The address is No. 1 Sing Guang Lane, BBC Street. - Sit down for some tea first! - Got the devil on your tail? Old fox. Old dog, is it really you? Is it hard to believe? I find it hard to believe you managed to find me so quickly. You really are crafty. You and your two brothers made a deal and you ran off. They went to jail. Now that they've escaped, they'll seek their revenge. Really? They found me. Where are they? You'll see them soon. Did you kill them both? Are you coming with me, or must I use force? Even if you don't use force, I will. Come on! Laster's taking too long. I'll go and look for him while you flick off the flies. Don't take too long. Old fox, if you kill me the sentence will be even harsher. You've done so many evil deeds, the law will catch up with you soon. Tell that to my brothers when you see them in hell! So this is what Master is like. Master, what's taken you so long? Little Boo came back for you. - Little Boo came back? - Yes, some time ago. Where is he now? Little Boo! What are you doing? Didn't you come back for Master? Come along. Master, I told you he was back here. So you saw everything. Not everything, but nearly. Master, what did he see? Master, why did you hit Little Boo? Master, stop! - Little Boo, what is it? - I... - Big Boo. - Master, don't do this! Don't do this, Master. Don't do this. I'll fight back if you attack me again. - Big Boo, how dare you hit your master? - You hit my brother! Don't think I won't hit you because you're old! Big Boo, let's go. No, you don't! Don't worry. We'll fight him together with the kung fu he taught us. Fight me together? What was that? I never saw the old man uses that. Little Boo, we're in trouble. We're going to lose. Why don't you go now? It's better that just one of us dies. Go now! No, I won't! Go, or you'll die! There'll be no one to avenge my death! Little Boo, go now. I always listen to you. Listen to me for once. If not, I'll tell father when I see him! Go! Avenge my death! Go! Big Boo! Delicious! Not bad. Huh? Where's my chicken? - It needs more seasoning. - More salt would be great. - How do you know? - The chicken is mine. Yours? - Your name isn't there. - Yes, it is. - Where is it? - On the thigh you're eating. Really? I can't find it. Tell me when you find it. You ate it. You have food but not wine, while I have the opposite. How about we divide this evenly? It's vinegar! I made a mistake. This is the wine. Chili sauce! - Water! - OK, water. Coming, coming. Here's some more. That's better. The water tastes strange. One is salty and the other's not. What water is it? It's mineral water from Lu Mountain. But I washed my feet with it. Fat beggar, how dare you trick me! No more energy? I'll help you get up. Come on. Come to bed. I've bumped into this fat beggar so many times. Is it fate? His kung fu is excellent. If I could learn from him, I could avenge Big Boss. Would he accept me as his pupil? I have no choice. I must try. Fat Uncle! Why have you changed your tune? There's something wrong. I... Why are you so obliging all of a sudden? You even cracked the walnuts for I want... You want some? You should have told me earlier. I've finished them. No... I... What? You want to wish me a prosperous new year? It's only Easter now. It's too early. No, it's about what you just did. You want me to be your master, so food, accommodation and everything will be at my expense. I free load on others! No way! Damn beggar! - One please. - One more. Uncle Fat, what was the kung fu you were practising? Mish-Mash style. Mish-Mash style? I don't know your kung fu, but there's something you don't know too. What don't I know? I know everything. No need to argue. We can try it now. If you can't do it, you teach me all your kung fu. What if I can do it? If you can do it... I'll beg for you. That way you can relax at home, make the fire and wait for your food. Wait for my food? Get ready to start begging. What do we do? Ask them to guess what it is. Never open your fist, no matter what. - Otherwise you lose. Can you do that? - Even a kid can do that. Whoever guesses what's in his hand gets this coin. - Chocolate. - No, it would melt. I think it's a penny. A peanut. - An olive stone. - There's nothing in there. A pebble. No one's guessed right. - What is it, then? - No one guessed right. Show us. Show you? Shall I? - Open it and let them see. - Really? See. - A piece of coal. - Yes. Never open your fist, no matter what. - Correct. - And you... Opened my fist. Thank you. Let's go. Boss, here's the money. Come on. You just wait! - Master. - No need to be formal. Now start. - Did the sticks dig in? - A little. Do it again. - And a little more? - Yes. If your legs are straight, it won't happen. Do it again. - Do it 30 times. - What? Get on with it. Wearing these shoes strengthens your stomach and legs. It needn't be so complicated. Give me some spinach and every part of my body will be strong. If spinach really worked, who would buy the other vegetables? Let go! Let go of this immediately! I'm a kid learning to swim. How do you mean? I won't let go. And I'm the inflatable ring? Train hard. No matter what, I must learn it. I'll grab... your neck. Don't laugh. Do it again. Mish-mash style. Choi style. Monkey style. - It feels good? - Yes. That feels good. - Try it again. - Master, I'm out of breath. You're out of breath already? OK, stamina training tomorrow. Start now. That's easy! You have to demonstrate all the techniques I've taught you. All right. Good, Master? I am, but you're not. Keep going. Master, that's enough. Don't talk and keep going. Master, I can't get up. Well, you have to. Get up! Get up and jump! Master! - I'll jump, I'll jump. - Go on then. Master, quicker please. - Quicker. - Yes. Why are you so slow? What is it, Master? Too tired? No. I'm running out of air. Running out of air? How about me becoming your master for a bit and we'll train your stamina. Come on. Jump. - How is my kung fu? - Quite good, but you still lack power. Why don't you go and buy some wine? I'll cook you my favourite chicken. Big Boo? - My name is Big Eye, not Big Boo. - Sorry. My mistake. Jia Wu Dao! Old devil! Is that you, Little Boo? You learned kung fu from me and you're no match of me. You didn't teach me that. You're no match for me. Your kung fu is quite good, but you lack power. How dare you say that! Let me teach you a lesson. Do I lack power? Ginger tastes best when it's old. Strong and lethal! Let's see how far you can go. Thank you. Here's the money. Please, don't fight. Don't fight. I didn't start it, he did. - I told you... - I lack power, right? - You really want to get involved? - I want to see you in a court room. - You're a beggar detective. - I look like one, don't I? Watch me. Don't fight... Catching chickens like an eagle? Please, don't fight. Chicken meeting snakes. We won't lose with me around. Monkey style? He's the clever monkey and me, I'm an angry monkey. - What happened? - Master, you're very heavy. Can't hit him, right? Catch the end! So, Master, you're a detective? But I shiver even at the thought of bad guys. Shiver? When we get back, I'll make you chicken soup to cure your shiver. - How are your legs? - I can't walk. Please carry me. All right.
