First, I was pricked by that porcupine. And by God, now what's happening to me? Professor? Ha! That was a clip from my guest Alexander Ronolio's first of many films, Beware the Porcupine Man. Alexander, what inspired you to bring your brand of je ne sais quoi to the silver screen? Well, Franklin, when I was a kid, we didn't have the money to go to the movies, but we did live next to a drive-in sci-fi theater. And so I would climb up on the roof, and I could see a man turn into a fly. I could see killer clowns. I could see a 50-foot woman. Uh... People don't know artists, they know their art. And as we fade, the art remains. All else comes and goes, but film... is forever. Mom, they're in my room! Bailey, what are you doing with my camera? How many time... I mean, why tell kids they can be anything they wanna be and then expect them to narrow it down? Anything they said that couldn't be done, they could do it with film. And film is anything. I think I'm gonna be sick. Yeah. Bailey, slate it! - Slate it. - Beware the Porcupine Man, take one. Hello? Hello? Oh! Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Bailey's hand's in the shot. We'll... We'll fix it in post. Kane, Kane! Careful, careful. Good, Bailey? Harper Belloway, live at the scene here as Keller Reid attempts to build the world's tallest Jenga tower. Shh! Keller! Come on, let's shoot this. Keller! Let's get this "shope" on the rope. You're missing out, Keller. Bailey, how's that look? Grab the other crab! Okay, okay, oh. Whoa! Oh, come on. - Don't be a baby. - Don't push me. - Oh. I could just make another crab. - Okay. - I've got plenty of crabs. - Yeah? - I've got crabs! - Wait, wait, wait! - I've got crabs! - Let me catch my breath! I've got crabs! Bailey, did we get a permit? Because they're cute, - but they're also savages. - Mm-hmm. And because I relate to them a lot. Maybe you'll be reincarnated as a polar bear. - Yeah. That's the dream. - And that would... - Ehh! - What? I just bit down on something. Ugh. You gonna finish that? - That is a piece of coral that was in my mouth. - That's disgusting. Oh. Did you ever hear... about swallowing watermelon seeds growing up? Yeah. Same thing if you swallow coral. It grows and takes over your entire body. So... - Everybody knows that. - Where is this coming from? - Everybody knows that. - What? - Nobody knows that! - Yeah. Bailey! - Don't bring him into this. - What happens when you swallow a watermelon seed? Bailey, you do not have to answer that. No, answer it. I wanna get it on video. - We're already ruining the moment. - It's capturing a moment. - Thank you very much. Yes. - Oh. Capturing the moment? Oh. - Okay, okay. - Okay. Whatever, I need a napkin. - Uh! - Okay. - So, are we calling in sick tomorrow? - No one's calling in sick. This guy calls in sick more than he shows up. Bailey, why don't you work on editing when we get home? You're gonna get carsick. So let's get this "shope" up on the rope, people. Okay. Editing's great. I think the editing... I thought it was great. It was fantastic. - Bailey, seriously, good job. - Yeah, good... Hey, can we talk about something? Okay. Yeah, yeah. What's up? I've been thinking a lot... and I think that we should... Keep it coral. - What? - Good night. Hey, I need your help with something. - Is it your attitude? - It's a video that I'm working on of my artwork. It's for a college application. Mmm. Harper's growing up. I'm a big girl now. - Good luck with that. - Wait, are you gonna help me? - I'm good. You got it. - Keller! Fine! I'll help you. Tell your sister to stop creeping. Good night. Is that my sweater? Little late. Uh, your father and I would like to have a talk with you. Carl? Hey! Hi, boys. Oops. - Sorry. Better? - No. - Better? - No. There we go. - Come on. Let's have a seat. - Where were you? Now you die! Ah! Another contest. Did they pay you upfront this time? No, it's a... it's a contest, Mom. Keller... You need to focus. You need to think about getting a real job. You need to maybe start paying rent. No more contests. Honestly, I wonder about the practicality of Bailey even going to film school. - Wait, wait... - Bailey, would you care to chime in here? - I'm sorry, son. - Don't apologize. - I'll apologize to whoever I want. - Where's my apology, then? Our son wants to be a filmmaker, not a bag boy. Maybe his father should have thought of that before he became a mechanic. I am not just a mechanic. I am a pinball mechanic. Die, Commie scum! - And you used to love pinball! - Fine. I'll get a job. I'll get a job. You can't win! Bailey!? Are you filming me sleeping? What? Don't! What? Why aren't you at school? Oh, you're sick? Bailey's sick. Oh, no. What's this week's performance gonna be? Oh. Oh, my God. Oh, Bailey! My sweet Bailey! Listen, high school is gonna suck. It's good that high school sucks 'cause that means you haven't peaked yet. So let's just get your backpack on, get some pants on, and I'll take you on my way to class. Let's get this "shope" on the rope. Cinema verit√©. What is it? - Mr. Reid. - Yeah, sorry. Sorry. - I... I can't dance... - If you don't want to dance, then don't show up late. - Not today... Please, please. - Mr. Reid! Shake your moneymaker. That's enough. Mr. Reid, please show up on time tomorrow, hmm? For everybody's sake. I have some exciting news for you lucky students. A graduate of our film department has decided to donate a grant to the team of students who can produce - a feature length motion picture. - Who's the donor? He wishes to remain anonymous. - It's Alexander Ronolio, isn't it? - I can't say. He's the only one from this department who'd have any money... You watch your mouth when you speak of this department! To be eligible, submit a scene which encompasses the very essence of what your film will be about by this time next week. The donor wishes for the filmmaker to be fast, nimble! One week. Collaborate. Now. Mr. Reid. Let me make one thing clear to you. If you plan on participating in this, you'll have to work with people, not just inanimate figures. I want warm bodies on that screen. Hmm? Get to work. He-hey. Um, would you want to work on my film with me? Well, we already have a group. But we need somebody to hold boom. S... oh. Just boom? Um... That's okay. I'm not really a boom guy, sorry. All right. That's fine with me. - Hey, would you guys wanna work on... - Already busy, dude. Serendipity. Maybe I could be of some assistance. Kruko. - I know who you are, Kruko. We're in class together. - What class? - This class. - You're Keller Reid! - Yep. - You're Kell... Keller Reid! Indeed. Need weed, Reid? No. Suit yourself, "Kemosake." But guess what? You need anything? Anything? Boom! Call Kruko. That's for you. Keep that. - You play guitar? - No. - Why do you have... - Mr. Kruko! Smoke that outside if you must. Bless you. Hey, can I borrow your notes? Okay. How's this? Um... Man-eating cats. Man eating cats. Ah, here's one. The Ordained Minotaur. After drinking magic holy water, a minister becomes a mythological half bull, half man. - Yeah. - Aren't your parents expecting you to get a job? My parents aren't gonna know about this. Well, you could get a summer job. No, my dad got a summer job, like, 20 years ago and summer's still not over. There's one right here. Uh, "Film me and my turtles hanging out." Yep, I don't have time for the turtle man right now. - I don't have time for anything but this. - Okay. - You're still gonna help me with my project, right? - Webcam disease. It's where your eyes lag two seconds behind your ears... - Keller. - What? My video for grad school? Yes, all right. Okay. I will make time for that. Okay, um... An average teenage girl. Just every time she blows bubblegum, it makes a fart sound. Critics call it "cafartic." How many of Ronolio's films do you think were based off fart jokes? Coral. A girl finds a beautiful fish... A red and blue fish... and follows it to its coral home, surrounded by miles of white dying coral. But she's too big to swim inside, and she scrapes herself... and suddenly coral grows on her skin. And she becomes more and more covered in it until sh... Um... What does that say? She dies. - She dies? - Wow. Inspiring ending. - Okay, endings are hard. - Well, how do you expect to shoot that in a week? I don't know! We'll do half live action and the other half stop motion and you could play Coral Girl who dies. M'kay, were you planning on asking if I had time? - Do you have time? - Wow, thank you for asking. Yeah! Um, well, I'm going up to Washington next Tuesday for an admissions interview... Or you know what? Maybe I'll just stay there. No. Um, that's great. Yeah. What about Bailey? Bailey? Bailey, can you help out with this project? He's got time. We've got time. Everybody's got time. That's great. All we need now are some more actors. I act. I was the lead in the fall play three years straight because of this monologue. Daddy wanted me to be tough but a lady. Yes, sir. No, ma'am. I wanna be great like you, Daddy. Look at me. Lost like balled up parchment on a cold, damp Chicago street. Your own father would sooner spit on your grave. - Okay, I think we're good. - I welcome the day when this world has long forgotten me and I can rest in a deep slumber tucked by the dirt and the maggots that occupy my soul. Till then, 'tis a cold night indeed. That... Wow. Um... Where did that come from? - I wrote it. - That's a lie. She just... She just lies for no reason. That's from Kissimmee Nights in Hell. I haven't seen that yet. When did you... She saw it last week with some guy. Bye. Um... Well, I think we're gonna go, so come on, Bailey. Okay. Hey. So you and Kruko? What? So you and Kruko? No. That's not what he said. Harpey, babe... It's a heart. That's no accident. Oh, Bailey. Okay, let's do this. Music for Coral. Take one. Hey, Peter. Tony? Yeah, it's Keller. Keller Reid. What's up, Shane? It's Keller. We have, like, three classes together. Anyways, I'm doing this short film. Hey, Phoebe, Keller Reid? You borrowed my pen once. Anyways, are you doing anything this weekend? Hey, listen, I need a grip and I noticed you have really large hands. Hey, Cherr. Hi, it's Keller. Keller Reid. I jumped your car that one time. Okay. Never mind. Ashley, it's Keller. Keller Reid. Keller Reid, yeah, um... From cinematography, we just did some scenes together. Not important, anyways. Listen, I'm working on... Ow. What happens when you swallow a watermelon seed? Keller! Keller! Okay. Hanging up. No, no. I'm sorry. I'm here. I'm here. Oh, great. Well, you're supposed to be here. - See you soon. - Okay. - Excuse me! - Get out of my room already. - That is my phone! - Just stay... But your room has the best lighting. What am I supposed... Am I interrupting something? I'm so... I'm... I'm so sorry. Maybe we can glue it or something? Everything okay? She has her own room, but no. I want skates, she wants skates. I'm an artist, she's an artist. I'm a thing, she's a thing. You guys have a lot in common. No. I mean, one year, she tried out for the same role as me - just 'cause she knew I wanted it. - Really? What was that? - Scarecrow. - Scarecrow? Mm-hmm. - So who got the part? - She did. I got Dorothy, but my dad dressed up as Toto, which was really sweet. Ah, yes, a self-portrait. I don't know. I love cats. No, I almost did die white water rafting. - Really? Oi. - Yeah! By my life vest. And you just... Squirtle, Charizard, Pikachu, others. Nah, I can only do three. Oh, sh... - How are you going to attach this to anyone's face? - Like this. He's the one that's with her from the beginning. And they kind of have this special relationship I don't know. Just kind of value that. He's just like us. We're all just the man behind the curtain. We're all just hiding behind ourselves. Hiding behind ourselves? Yeah. Welcome to my philosophy class. What do you think happens when we die, then? That was a bit of a leap. Now it's starting to feel like that's all I have to remember him by, just these videos. Keller? - Hi! Hey! - Hey. Melinda's son has a collection of turtles that he needs someone to record, and he can pay you $100. And I said you would love to. Uh, Mom, I don't really have time to be recording... Why not? I think it would be a great opportunity. Uh, I just don't. I have a, um, a job interview. Where? Um... - Apple. - Wow. What? That's great. Well, let me know how it goes. That's... huh! Uh, oh, okay. I gotta run, but, um, check on your brother for me, okay? - He's not feeling that great. - Oh, okay. - All right. Bye. - Yeah. Yeah, all right. Bye, Mom. - Love you, son. - Love you, Mom. Bye. Hey, Mom says you're not feeling too good. Let me feel. Okay, I'll let you rest. You faker! Let me feel your head! Let me feel that forehead. Oh, you're so sick. You have to go to school, Bailey! People who don't go to school become pinball mechanics like Dad! - Hey, Dad... - Do you have a second? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Good. This machine wasn't so happy. A kid caught his finger up in the coin return once. This one right here. I had to cut his finger clean off. If it wasn't for that machine, you two wouldn't even be here. That's how I met your mom. But I quickly found out... Hey. I quickly found out... that life would work out... if you, uh, you know, just pull back... and let go. I wasn't happy... because I wasn't making anyone happy... - unless I was fixing pinball machines. - Dad. - I don't wanna play pinball. - Then don't. I was talking to Bailey. It's not all about you. Got it? Okay. Come on. Let's have some fun. Hey. You ever see Ghost? Like the movie Ghost? Where he's like... they do this. And he's a ghost. Touch me again and I'll cut your hand off and call it art. Harpey, Harpey. Hey, you've got sponge on your face. It's coral, actually. - Um... I was gonna tell you... - Wait. Sorry. Think I'm gonna leave this to you this weekend. No. - What? - One of the grad schools wants me to paint something new. - Oh... - Anyway, I'm supposed to drive it up this next weekend. Oh, wait. Next weekend? - Yeah, this next weekend. - Are you saying this weekend or next weekend? - The next weekend that's happening. - That's not next weekend. - That's this weekend. - Okay. Well, this weekend. I'm driving this weekend. We're shooting. We're shooting this weekend. Well, yeah, but you can find someone else. You're the main actor. What about next weekend? - What? - Maybe you could drive up there next weekend. - I could go with you. We could... - No, I don't wanna risk them saying forget it. - I might actually get into this school, you know? - Yeah. I mean, can't you be excited for me? Of course. That's amazing. I'm very excited for you. Really? Yeah. Yes, I was just... You just what? I don't know, I was j... I was kind of counting on you. You always count on me, and I've been counting on you to make that application video for me, like you said you would. How's that coming? I've been busy. Everyone is. I also have things going on. I also have things going on, Keller. And Bailey, your parents, there are other people besides you. Even Kane knew that. Kruko. Somebody say Kruko? Did somebody say Kruko? Keller Reid! Hey, bud. - Is this your kid? - That's my... No, that's my brother, Bailey. Brother Bagely. Pleasure's all mine. Uh, let's get this "shope" on the rope. Where did you... Where'd you hear that from? I've been saying that since I was a little tot, I think. Okay, did you get my text? Uh, no, I... I don't believe in written communication. - Okay, um... I need an actor for today. - Yeah. - Have you ever acted before? - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. - You know Shakespeare? - Yeah. Okay. Angela's not answering. Let's go pick her up. Let's get this, uh, "shope..." - Okay. Just get in the car. - Whew. Whoa! Brother Bagely! Kruko, I'm gonna need you not to do that. I thought you were going on a job interview. Uh, I am. With your brother and...? Sex omelette, Kitty Cat. - What's... What is that? - I... just ig... - It's Kruko. - Kruko! What's that? Uh, it's paperwork. Keller, I swear to God, if this is another useless contest you're entering, you have got to get a job or you're gonna have to move out of the house. Wh-wh... Mom, I'm getting a job. Okay, I'll get a job... Are you telling me that trunk is not full of equipment? Hmm? Open the trunk. Keller. Open it. Keller. Pop it. - I think she wants you to open the trunk. - Open it. Whoo! Savage move, Keller Reid. Ah, who was that? Whew. - What? - Hi! Ms. Belloway, I'm here to see... - Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Harper! - Thank you. I'm here to see Angela! Boom! Hey. Um... Sorry. Didn't mean to... Is, um, Angela... I'm not here... Is Angela here? - Ang... Angela home? - Angela! She'll be right down. Thank... Thank you! I'm feeling... I'm feeling pretty hiccupy. You know what I mean? All right. Gotta work on that, "Kemosake." Okay? Work on that a little bit. All right. Boom! - Hi! - Hi! Hi! Uh, I'm ready. Heh, you look ready. Thanks. Uh, I tried really hard. I can... I can see that. I'm giving you one last chance, "Kemosake." Okay? Listen. You got demons in you, man. You know how I know? I got 'em, too. Okay? Come on. Come on! Come on, Bagely. Scare me, huh? Do it! Come on! Come on, Bagely! Come on, man! Come on! Come on! Do it! Let's do it right now! Right now! Three, two, one! G... Hey, you okay? - What were you guys... - Did you... - What were you... - Oh, do you... - Just... - You go. - You want me to... - Would you... - Kruko. - Kruko. Angela, um, script's back there, and marshmallows like you wanted. Okay, Kruko, I got a swimsuit for you, too. Won't need it. - I insist. - Hey, toss me one of those sugar pillows, Mama. Kellermundo, you'll like this. Bagely, check it out. Kruk... Kruko, stop. Stop. - That's so cool. - Stop lighting things in my car. That's the mallow candle, brother. That's for you. I never told you that? They called me Pyro in pre-K. Is there nutmeg in here? Don't touch my glove box, Kruko. Have you read the script? - Kruko? I... - Yo? - Have you read the script? - No. Don't need to, "Kemosake." Boom! - Stop doing that! - So she dies? - That's how it ends? - Yeah. Did you see that girl? She, like... Oh, it was that, it was that. - Never mind. - Bailey, wait don't read...! - Okay. - Let it all out, Bagely. - There you go! - Let me get you some water. Let Mother Nature do her thing. Open those valves. Okay. Oh! Here, drink this. Heh. - Vomit is just... - All right, um... The body's way of saying try again later. Okay, you good? All right. We good to go? Okay. Um... Why... Why don't you just take a... take a nap? Sure? Good? Okay, cool. - Kruko! - Yo! - Let's go! - Whoo! Hey, not to marsh the mellow, "Kemosake," but, uh, how are we gonna shoot this with no camera? Okay, uh, Kruko. Kruko. Kruko! Hey, Kruko. Yeah. Hey, man, we gotta get a take, okay? - You got it, "Kemosake." All right. - Okay. Just stay here. All right. We're still good, Bailey? Okay, cool. Kruko! Kruko! Hey, Kruko. We need to get rolling. Okay? - You got it, "Kemosake." - Okay. Great, cool. Kruko. Kruko. Kruko. We need to get a take. Okay? You got it, "Kemosake." Bailey, we're good? Okay, um... Kruko. Listen. Listen. The sea. It's ready. Great. Okay, Angela. Angela. Okay, hey. All right, great. Guys, I need you to get close together. And we're gonna get a shot of you running up onto the beach together. Okay, good? Okay. Ready? And... Good, Bailey? Okay. And... action! Good, good. Now, Angela, your arm hurts. Ow, ow, ow, ow! And, Kruko, now you console her. You make her feel better. Yeah. Good. Goo... No, guys, no. Stop, stop! Oh, too much. Way too much. All right. Stop. Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Okay, that's enough. Um, Bailey, how we doing? Okay, uh, I'll just... I'll just delete some stuff. It's gonna be fine. Hey, I was thinking, what if we got a shot up there on that rock? Got really high up. Looking out into the horizon. What do you think? Hey, guys, guys, hey! - Whoa, hey! I'm getting the shots here! - That's not... We need another take, okay? So if you can get in positions. What was wrong with the last one? The camera ran out of space. We need another take. Can't you just, like, fix it in post? The camera was not recording. We need another take. Okay, guys? - We've been filming for hours! - We just got here! Uh, if we're gonna be filming for much longer, I'm gonna need to increase my pay. Your pay is supposed to be marshmallows! Okay, let's take a break. How about that? Put your shirt back on. Help her get into makeup. Stop making out. Bailey, go get the reflector, please. Let me make some room on here. Bailey. Bailey, I need you get the reflector. Okay? Thank you. Kane! - 911. What's your emergency? - Hi! Uh. - Uh. - Hello? Are you under duress? Hello? Are you able to respond... - Hey! - Wh-What? - Stop, stop, stop, stop! - What? Hey, hey, hey! - No! Stop! Stop! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy, "Kemosake!" It's Kemosabe, Kruko! Kemosabe! - Bagely! The anger... - My name is Bailey! Okay, okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - Wanna get... Let's get a shot up... - I'm not getting up there. Why am I always behind the camera? I shoot the shots, I edit the videos, I do the music. But it's always the Keller Reid show! Okay, it... It doesn't have to be that way. That should be me making out with Angela. But you casted some big, dumb idiot that you don't even know. And you didn't even consider me. Bailey, I thought you wanted to shoot it. Did you ever think maybe I'm sick of shooting stuff for you? Hey, hey, Bailey, hey, hey. Okay, okay. - We can talk about this later, okay? - We don't talk! We only talk about videos, but if you wanna talk about something, Kane died! Kane's dead! And we haven't talked about it once. I'm not your goddamn production assistant. I'm your brother! Talk to me. Bailey. - We can talk about this later. I need you to help... - You shoot it! I'm done, Keller! - I'm done helping you! - Fine! Hey, Keller. Oh, you don't look so good. Keep it coral. Bailey? The footage. Did... Doctor! Hello, Mr. Reid. I'm Dr. Krukowski. How are you feeling today? Like I fell off a cliff. You're very lucky considering that fall. You're gonna have to take it easy for a little bit and wear that brace for a couple days. Other than that, you'll be just fine. Wait. Doctor, can you take a closer look at my throat? I think... I think something might be growing inside of it. Go and open up. All right. - Say ah. - Ah. - More like ahh. - Ahh. - Ahh. Ahh. - Ahh. All right, go ahead and give us a swallow. Like a, like a... A swallow. Like you're swallowing some, like, like a large something. Like you should've chewed it a bit more. Swallow. Yeah. All right. Bailey, has your brother been under a lot of stress lately? Only for the past seven years. Hmm. It's just stress. It's... just stress? That c-c-clicking sound you're hearing is your throat muscles tightening up. The more you think about it, the more it's gonna happen. So just don't think about it. Uh, how do I... How do I do that? Relax. Try meditation. When you're feeling better, exercise. But no more rock climbing. Okay? Anyhoo, the lady, I mean, the nurse, which is a man, will be in here in a moment to help get this "shope" on the rope. Ah. Harpey! Babe, what are you doing here? You've been here. This is my house. Angela's my sister. Who's Angela? Harpey! - Did you just slam the door on my boyfriend? - Kruko is not your boyfriend. You don't get to tell me who is or is not my boyfriend. - Stupid. Stupid. - Come on, Kruko. Come on, Kruko. - I don't need your protection. - Know what? Yes, you do. - Give that back to me. - Clearly you do. - Okay. - Why do you always have to have your cell phone? Give it back to me. I'm just looking out for you, okay? You were my best friend and you didn't need any followers to tell you you were special. Nobody ever thought I was special. Dad did. I do. Hey. What? Wait! Come on! Come on! Bailey. You know why I want to make this movie? I want Mom to see that a film degree was worth it... for you. A four-hour nap back to Vegas, and that's all you came up with? Bailey. Mom? Mom, can you let me in? We did not leave off good. Um... I don't have a job at Apple. God, I could go for an apple right now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I sped away with Bailey. I'm sorry Kane's gone. I'm sorry your son's gone. That must've been so hard for you. Bless you. Uh, thank you. Did words just come out of your mouth? Yeah. Do you wanna sit? Please don't touch my things. Uh, it's missing a couple legs, but, um... I found it. Sometimes I go to this beach. My dad, he loves this... Loved this beach. And, um, one time... This is gonna sound really, really crazy, but, um, this crab just crawls right up to me, and it just stops, and it's just looking up at me with its little eye stalks, like... like it knows me, like, like it knows exactly what I was going through. And in that moment, I just... I just let go... 'cause I was just in that moment. You wanna hear my music? Yeah. Okay. Put these on. Thank you. Yes. Yes! Bailey? Dear Keller, endings are hard, but this is better than she dies, I think. After being scraped, the girl becomes more and more covered in coral until not a single spot on her body remains untouched. And she retreats to where coral reefs once thrived into the ocean and dies. But then, beneath the waves, all of the miles of coral that was once bleached comes back to life, vibrant and reincarnated. Keep it coral, Keller. Harper. This one goes out to all the invertebrates out there. To me, nothing beats what's behind the scenes. You let your guard down because no one will ever see this. Get out of here, sir! You want them to remember you for that perfect take... ...that perfect performance. Keller, you wanna make something in a week. - Hey, Bailey. - Something that lasts forever. And whether or not you do, just remember... you're my brother... and that's forever. - Hey. - Hey. Was that you up there? - Yeah... That was, uh... - Onscreen? Me and Bailey, my brother Bailey. Ah. Bailey? Yes. Well, I recognize you. Well, the actors. Nice to meet you. - Alexander. - Hi. Hi. Hello. My first film, shot it in a cemetery about three miles wide. The night before production began I walked the entire estate barefoot. I put my hand on every single tombstone, every crucifix, every monument. I wanted to know that... Even though I never met these souls, nor had they known me or who I was or who I would become, that at least for a moment, I could touch the lives of those who lived in the same world as me and the world that would become. - Wow. - Because without people, filmmakers like us are nothing. And this year's winner is... Luther Barker for The Prince of Magic. Wow! I'm honored to receive this award, but I could not have pulled it off without support from my amazing friends, my family, my team. You know, I'm gonna need you all to shoot this feature... Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm trying to leave. - Hey, Keller! What's up, man? - Hey! Congratulations! Aw, thank you. I wanted to... I wanted to say thank you - because you held the boom for us... - Yeah. - ...and we couldn't have done it without you. - I got to go, but congrats. Wait, wait, no, no, no, you don't. You don't have to go. You can't go. Alexander Ronolio just invited us all to his spot, his private studio, and we're gonna be talking about parties and movies and all kinds of great ideas. You gotta come, man. He invited you, he wants you to be here. - He invited me? - Yeah, he invited us all. And you're part of the team. Let's do it. Come on! I c... Can my brother go instead?
