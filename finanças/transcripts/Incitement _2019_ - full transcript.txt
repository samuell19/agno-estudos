This signing of the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles here today, it's not so easy. Neither for myself, as a soldier in Israel's wars, nor for the people of Israel, not to the Jewish people in the Diaspora, who are watching us now with great hope mixed with apprehension. It is certainly not easy for the families of the victims of the wars, violence, terror, whose pain will never heal. We remember each and every one of them with everlasting love. We have come from Jerusalem, the ancient and eternal capital of the Jewish people. We have come from an anguished and grieving land. We have come from a people, a home, a family, that has not known a single year, not a single month, in which mothers have not wept for their sons. We wish to open a new chapter in the sad book of our lives together. A chapter of mutual recognition, of good neighborliness, of mutual respect, of understanding. We, like you, are people. People who want to build a home, to love, live side by side with you in dignity, in empathy, as human beings, as free men. Let me say to you, the Palestinians: We who have fought against you say to you today in a loud and a clear voice... Enough of blood and tears. Enough! We have no desire for revenge, we harbor no hatred towards you, we are today giving peace a chance. Today here in Washington, at the White House, we have come to try and put an end to the hostilities, so that our children, our children's children, will no longer experience the painful cost of war, violence and terror. We hope... We hope to embark... ...on a new era in the history of the Middle East. A time to kill and a time to heal. A time to love and a time to hate. A time of war and a time of peace. Ladies and gentlemen, the time for peace has come. Wake up, open your eyes! Look what this demonic government is doing! Rabin's a traitor! Overthrow the government! Whoever cooperates with a government that hands over land to Arabs is a Kapo! He must die! Overthrow the government! Get your hands off me! Get off of me, I'm not touching you! Rabin is a traitor! Police state! Police state! Police state! No, wait, I didn't do anything! - Shut up! - I swear. Wait, let me go! Wait, no! I'm a law student, a criminal record will ruin me! You should've thought of that before. Shut up! I'm about to get married! She will kill me... She'll dump me. Please, have some mercy... She won't marry me, let me go. Get out of here. Go back to the university. Get lost! Okay, I'm out of here. I'm going. Don't worry. Death to the Arabs! Why didn't you come to the protest? - Studied for an exam... - You're really something. - How are you? - What's up, bro? Ahmed... Moustafa... Muhammad... Mahmoud... Thank you! Bar-Ilan University students chose to protest against the agreement with the PLO in an unusual manner. A student, who also serves as a reserve officer, handed out plastic rifles to protesters dressed as Palestinian policemen. One of the students stood with a microphone, "Rabin, we thank you for arming us," he said. After receiving the weapons, they "shot" the officer, to show what they believe will happen next. Slaughter the Jews! Slaughter the Jews! I'm honored to invite Dr. Uri Milstein, author of the book "The Rabin File." Rabin is selling the Oslo Accord to the public with lies. He'll wreak havoc upon Israel! This is a man who shot Jewish soldiers aboard the Altalena! - You're the one selling lies. - Shut up! He's a war criminal! They shot at Rabin with a cannon. They were unloading illegal weapons that they promised to give the IDF. A country has only one army. It was a mutiny! I'll say what I have to say! You can't silence me... We're each entitled to our own opinion. I'd now like to invite Rabbi Benny Elon to the stage. Shmuel... Hey, Yigal. What happened to you? - Nevermind. Got a spare shirt? - No, man. 67 Jews. 67 Jews were massacred on that holy Sabbath... - Can we swap shirts? - No way. ...20 years before Israel was founded. Ask Skornik... - 67 souls... - I have a date. - The Jews of Hebron... - A date? Yeah. - With who? - Nevermind, just give it to me! Tell me! With Nava. - As opposed to the secular outlook... - You heartbreaker, you. ...whereby history is determined by a person's actions. And as opposed to the passive, ultra-Orthodox outlook, whereby the will of God determines all. As disciples of the late Rabbi Kook, who determined that our time is the start of Redemption, we must strive to understand the actions of the Almighty. We must learn His will and then come to His aid as heroes. We must act with God. And what is God's will at this time? That we fight for the land He promised our forefathers. And he who acts with God shall receive his reward! Kids? - 4 or 5. - That's it? - Maybe, just maybe, 6. - Okay. - Location? - In Psagot, of course. Near your parents? Maybe a different settlement, but the same idea. - Has to be a settlement? - Yes. Why? Are you afraid? Hell no. Now it's my turn. Go ahead, ask. - Education? - The most important thing. No, I mean, what kind? Ultra-Orthodox? National Religious? When I was 12, my parents wanted to send me to a yeshiva in Herzliya. I said, I'm not going there! I'll only go to the best yeshiva, in Tel Aviv. My father asked, "How? "It's THE best yeshiva. And it's Ashkenazim. "They accept two Sephardim a year, at best. "You think they'll accept some Yemenite?" And? I signed up, took the tests and got in. Just like that, at age 12. And I graduated with honors. I'm like a laser pointer, Nava. A laser pointer? I mark targets and conquer them one by one, no matter what. I wonder what your next target is. I want you to come to my house. Isn't it too soon? Just a short visit. Meet my parents. Meet my mother. You'll love her, she's funny. 57 killed in Hebron, according to Palestinian reports concluding this day of bloodshed. Dr. Baruch Goldstein arrived at the Cave of the Patriarchs during the Muslims' morning prayers, and opened fire on the worshippers. 25 were killed on the spot, and dozens were injured. The injured were evacuated by residents in private vehicles to local hospitals. Here, Yigal, eat it while it's hot. Crispy, as you like it. Don't let your mother see... He put in earplugs and started shooting. He emptied one magazine, then another... Lord have mercy. A religious Jew massacring worshippers mid-prayer. It's insane! Soldiers patrolling the city were taken by surprise... I hope this massacre won't bring more bloodshed in retaliation. The Prime Minister issued a strong condemnation: The government and citizens of Israel severely condemn this heinous murder of innocent people in cold blood. The cabinet then convened for one of its most difficult meetings. Whoever paid attention to the terminology used by the settlers and their rabbis, even on their radio station, about "The Law of the Pursuer," which permits killing, could see this coming. Yigal! Come help. It's Purim. Even when times are tough, we must celebrate! Military authorities prohibited Goldstein's burial in Hebron, and he's set to be buried in nearby Kiryat Arba. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Where to? - The funeral. - Where did you come from? - Herzliya. I'm a Jew bro, don't worry. Go ahead. Who dwells above Grant proper rest Under the wings of the Divine Presence In the exalted spheres of the holy And pure For the soul of the deceased who was sacred, Righteous and devout, Baruch Kopel, son of Israel, Of the Goldstein family May God avenge his death! Rabbi Baruch, may God avenge his death, was a Jew full of heart. He never forgot a single Jew that died in his arms. Harming the Divine People means harming divine justice. Revenge is a natural reaction, spontaneous, flowing with nature, uniting with the ecosystem, a divine spark! This is the time to mention the well-known Jewish Law ruling given by Rabbi Kook, of blessed memory: "One should sooner be killed than give up land in Israel!" Baruch Goldstein acted on his Jewish character. An act of pure Jewish revenge. Not a thuggish outburst, but an admirable reaction of an exemplary Torah scholar. Like Phinehas, who killed the leader of the tribe of Simeon to redeem the people from the plague, Rabbi Baruch got up and took action. Hagai! You're still here? Go to Carmela's and unclog her drain. She's been driving me nuts all day. Come back for dinner. - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. - You know why we named him Yigal? - No. - Mom, stop... - Let me talk! I held him in the delivery room... A fat teddy bear. Shlomo came in and said: "We'll name him Yehuda. What's wrong with Yehuda?" Yehuda was the first person in the Torah to admit his mistake. I looked at him and thought: Fine. Yehuda. But at the circumcision, loads of guests, the rabbi raises the scalpel, my brother-in-law yells, "Stop!" "We'll call the boy Yigal , "so he can redeem the Jewish people." Everybody went quiet. You must understand, it was during the War of Attrition. We needed hope. But I'd already promised Shlomo "Yehuda." The rabbi said, "It's a sign from God: The baby's name, my name and his father's name..." Did you catch the phrase? Yigal - Geula - Shlomo. I've always told him, there are lots of Yigals, but none of them "shall bring total redemption." All is determined by God. You haven't met the little ones yet! These are Amitai and Sagiv. - Say hello, this is Nava. - Hello! And... goodbye. Oh, Shoshana, welcome! That's Aunt Shoshana. She plays music at mom's preschool. We don't care about ethnicity. We're all part of "beautiful Israel". We call it "jalleh", we sit around the table, sing and argue all night. I didn't expect so many people... - Hello, everyone. - Hi, Dror, welcome! Come on in, sweetheart. Dror is an army buddy of mine. How are you, Vardit? He's dying to get set up with Vardit... How are you, bro? - Say hello to Nava. - Hello. Listen, I can't stay. What? Why? I have a big exam tomorrow. But we haven't even started eating. I feel like I'm blacking out. You need iron, sweetie. Some good meat! - Sit, we'll feed you. - Thanks, but I have to study. I need quiet to study. I always do. At least have a bite to eat. Sorry, I'm really stressed out. It was nice meeting you. I'll come again soon. Now? - Did my mom scare you? - Of course not. You should have told me there's a meal. I told her not to publicize it. She likes telling anyone who will listen. Don't worry, she's lovely, I just need... I'll come again. I promise. Okay? Gali? Bye. Bye, Nava. - She's a nice girl. - Yeah. Beautiful, quiet... But what a princess! Thinks she's made out of marble. - Why do you say that? - Open your eyes, Shlomo. - She'll dump and humiliate Gali. - Oh, come on! No Ashkenazi will let his daughter marry a Yemenite who's still single at 24. I was engaged to an Ashkenazi, her parents liked me. I left her and chose you, didn't I? Trust my instincts, Shlomo. She patronized me. When I blacklist someone, that's it! That's nonsense. What's ethnicity got to do with it? They are the hypocrites. Show her you're serious, get engaged. Another romance expert. Don't interfere! You're both ancient. Mark my words: Those settlers seem nice. But when it comes to marriage, they only marry among themselves. As the poem goes, "We both come from the same village." They're worse than Labor Party supporters. I'll grow hair on my palms before she invites you to meet her parents. Oslo I: Gaza-Jericho Agreement May 4, 1994 Two months after the Hebron massacre, a month after the suicide bombings in the north, stage one of the Oslo Accords is on its way: "Gaza and Jericho first". There is an opposition on both sides to what we are doing today, and it will require a lot to achieve peaceful coexistence and a permanent solution. Earlier today, Ariel Sharon of the opposition reacted to the agreement: If the government is not able or willing due to flawed political motives, to fight against terrorism, we must organize volunteers to secure our roads. Many will volunteer, myself included. 27 years of Israeli military rule in Gaza & Jericho come to an end. God have mercy on us. IDF posts will be taken over by the Palestinian police. Israel will also release 1,400 Palestinian prisoners. Democracy today has one main role - to disappear. The Israeli democracy has served its purpose and must now disintegrate and bow down before Judaism. - That's it. - What do you mean? Let's see what's going on in the protest tent... I'll just say hello to a friend. I'll join you in a bit. Arik! Hey, Yigal! It's good to see you. You too. Officer School, eh? - I always knew you'd be an officer. - Yep. - Still in the special forces? - Sure thing. And you? - I'm studying law. - That's good. - I need a favor. - Talk to me. I need some weapons. What for? Something important. We'll talk about it in private. - Okay. - Can you help me out? Let's talk. OK, I'm going into the tent. You got me curious, Yigal. I'm counting on you. This government must be held accountable. Whoever gives weapons to terrorists cannot be acquitted. It's a classic case of "The Law of the Pursuer". I'm not sure "Pursuer" applies here... But "The Law of the Informer" sure does. It's our duty to warn the government and the Prime Minister. - Theoretically, yes. - Why should we warn him? Rabin listens to Arafat, not to rabbis. If he ignores the warning, he must pay with his life. Maimonides said it plainly: "He who kills him. Shall be rewarded!" - Yigal, we're leaving... - Go, I'll be right out. Not every ruling can be made public. After all, this involves a human life. Let's pray to God it will not come to this... Maimonides says explicitly: "It is forbidden to inform on a fellow Jew to gentiles." And "It is allowed to kill an Informer anywhere, "even when the death penalty is not in practice." And if Rabin is an Informer... It's no joke, it's Jewish Law. "She tosses and turns on her bed every day, "She's so very fat, she can barely..." Walk! "On the second floor lives a cuckoo bird..." So, what's up with Vardit? Don't worry. I have a knack for these things. But give me a few more days... You'll be a match made in heaven! From your mouth to God's ears. My sister's stubborn, just so you know. But you two make a good match. I'm counting on you. What's this? Did it come in a cereal box? What kind of big brother are you? Get the kid a grown-up gun. You want a silencer for your Uzi? Of course I do. I'll build you one. I want a real silencer... Why are you so secretive? I'll build you a real one. Are you gonna pull out a missile? It's just a map. I'm forming an organization. What organization? Stage one - a Jewish defense force. We'll take over every post the IDF evacuates. A true biblical hero. You'll replace the army? Let him speak! Patrols, guard duty... Welcome to the Herzliya summer camp. Enough with your jokes. Ever heard of "coming to God's aid as heroes"? This is serious. If you're not into it, leave. And I was thinking of setting him up with Vardit... Come on, I'm serious. Even if you put 10 guards by the fence, a terrorist can come in through the sewers. Stage two - a militia. Revenge. We'll do what the army wouldn't dare to do. They kill a soldier? We'll take out 10 PLO terrorists. They kill a civilian? We'll blow up a mosque and kill 20. - Like Dr. Goldstein. - Exactly. But we'll come back alive. The IDF releases murderers? We'll go to their village, knock on their door... Boom! Shoot 'em in the head. After all, we were in the "Golani" combat unit. I was in "Givati". And where will you find fighters for... - your militia? - Let me tell you. I'll organize religious retreats in the settlements, in Hebron, Jericho, the Gaza Strip. We'll get students to come, check the people out, find out who was in combat, and decide who to trust. Shabbat Retreat at the Ancient Synagogue in Jericho - Thanks, Mia. - No problem, Yigal. Guys! I want you there, no excuses. - What's up, buddy? - Yigal! - How are you? - Thank God. Listen, I'm organizing a Shabbat retreat in Jericho. Here... High-class, not Avishai's hooligans. I want you there. We'll find a worthy match for you too. Don't worry, Yigal. I'll come, but not for the girls. Say, don't you have contacts in Parliament? I was a Tehiya Party activist. Why? Can you get the list of terrorists being released? I'll check. Yigal. Nava! So you're a travel agent now? Can I book a trip to Turkey? I'm out of tickets to Turkey, but I do have a couples' package deal to Jericho's ancient synagogue. I hear it's amazing. Sounds tempting, where do I sign up? Stop splitting up our people! I'm already holding retreats. Do you have exclusive rights? The point is to get people out there, and instead of helping, you're stealing people away. I'm not stealing anyone. Your retreats are full of Kahanists. That's bad for the cause. You got a problem with Kahane? You know who predicted all this? Rabbi Kahane, the prophet of this generation! Yigal, let's go. You know what? From now on, we'll coordinate. Okay? Come on, Yigal. Way to go! The most sought-after girl on campus. Yigal, so many tough guys here, huh? Our militia will be overflowing with commando fighters. - Shut up! - You could've brought Vardit along. - Why did we stop? - It's a Palestinian flag! Don't worry guys, stay in your seats. I'll handle it. Where are they going? Where to, guys? The synagogue in Jericho. We coordinated with the army. Oh, you're the Bar-Ilan group. Jericho synagogue, it's okay. In this very place, the Israelites entered the Land of Israel, returning from slavery in Egypt. Here they crossed the raging Jordan River, and right here Elijah the Prophet ascended into Heaven. And here stood the Tabernacle where Saul was anointed King. "To your descendants I give this land, "from the valley of Egypt to the great Euphrates River." Abraham's covenant with God. No one has the right to negotiate or compromise on borders narrower than these. This is God's will and it must be fulfilled. Boys on the right, girls to the left. - Dror, help me out here. - Sure. Start prepping for Shabbat. Nava, wait. I want to show you something. A surprise. Wow. This is amazing. So primal... It's like stepping into the Bible. See the circles and squares? Count them. - 32. - Exactly. That's the numeric value for the Hebrew word "heart." See? The circle represents emotions and the square, the mind. 32 circles and 32 squares. - See how it's connected? - Yes. It's the union of mind and emotions. Look at the hearts. So beautiful... "Peace upon Israel". 1,700 years. You can feel how our forefathers stood here and prayed. Yigal. What? Well done. For what? This Shabbat retreat. You organized it... like a champ. Could you see yourself with a husband who would fight, even sacrifice his life in God's name? Like a biblical martyr? Don't be cocky. Not me, not me. I just want to get to know you better. Were you asking seriously? Yes. Then I'm not sure. It took Queen Esther a long time to gather the courage, too. I want you to be a queen. I'd dedicate my entire life for your happiness. Words cannot describe the horrors at Dizengoff Street in Tel Aviv. One of the worst terror attacks our country has ever known. The number of casualties keeps rising: At first it was 10, then 14, 16, and the official count now is 22 dead. I was right across the street when we heard the explosion. We approached the bus... Should I heat up some food? You haven't eaten all day. You have no right to say anything, Shlomo. You were in favor of the Oslo Accords. No, I wasn't! You're so blind. Happy now? Look at those corpses. I only said that if there's a chance for peace, we must try. One can always wage war. Some security expert you are... You didn't even serve in the army. Prime Minister Rabin chose to favor Arafat and the well-being of the people of Gaza over the security of Israeli citizens. Even Netanyahu says, Rabin is handing over our nation to that murderer Arafat. He's an Informer! God forbid. Maybe a sinner. An Informer and a Pursuer. What? You think I made it up? Everyone's saying it, you're just turning a blind eye. Such talk is shameful. Hamas, according to certain Israeli spokespeople, are free of all responsibility. They are not the killers, but rather the Israeli government. Those nationalists put nonsense in his head. A Jew studies Torah for years before saying something he didn't hear from his rabbis. And my son sentences someone to death, just like that? "An Informer, a Pursuer"?! The State of Israel is facing a crucial decision. Do we want separation between us and the Palestinians just as a temporary closure for a few days, or as a way of life? "Mishneh Torah" by Maimonides. "Murderers and Preservation of Life" "Saving the pursued by killing the pursuer." Rabin gives weapons to Arabs who kill us. Pursuer? "When a person pursues another "with the intention of killing him, "a Jew must rescue the pursued, "even by killing the Pursuer." Informer? "It is forbidden to inform on a fellow Jew to gentiles. "Anyone who does inform or hand over a Jew "has no place in Heaven." "It is allowed to kill an Informer anywhere, "even when the death penalty is not in practice." Rabin is an Informer and a Pursuer. The man controlling the government and Rabin is Ahmad Tibi. You know nothing about terrorism... Our armed forces should send 3 Cobra helicopters to wipe out... Cuties. Nava. - Yigal! - Hello. Dad, Mom... - Come. - Hello. Hello. - Hi, I'm Yitzhak. - Nice to meet you, I'm Yigal. - Pleasure to finally meet you. - Yes. It's beautiful out here. - Your first time in Psagot? - Yes, it's a lovely settlement. Thank you. I hope to come more often. - Oh, sure... - We'd like that. God willing, our door is always open. Thank you. Amir. What's up, my man? - How are you? - What are you doing here? I'm Nava's guest. What a small world... Totally. I haven't seen you since we got discharged. -Yeah. See this skinny boy? He served in the army with me! Looks naive, right? During searches in refugee camps, Yigal here was the executor. - You're exaggerating. - We were tough too, but this guy was full on. He was like Rambo with the Arabs. Gave 'em the special treatment... Hey, quiet down. Quiet down? This guy used to beat the hell out of them and come out with a huge smile. Right, bro? Yigal... Sorry, someone wants to meet you. - Good to see you, brother. - You too. Grandma, this is Yigal. - Hello. - Hello. Where are you from, Yigal? Herzliya. Where in Herzliya? Neve Amal. - Yigal's father is a Torah scribe. - Oh, is he? How nice. And you? I... Studying the Torah? - Yigal studies a lot, of course. - Oh. I try to, yes. You'll be a Torah scribe, like your father. Um... no. I'm studying law... What does your mother do? She runs her own preschool. - Religious? - Mixed. Were your parents born in Israel? No, in Yemen. Yemen... how nice. Second-year law student? Nice. What's next? Frankly, I'm not that interested in law. I'm taking computer classes, too. Shouldn't you work at a large firm for a few years? Then you can do whatever you want. Don't worry. I'm like a laser pointer, I mark targets. Thank God, so far I've done well. Amazing. What? You're basically an extension of Ramallah. Yes. Ramallah Heights. - I have no problem with them. - With who? The Arabs. What do you mean? Our real problem is the traitors within us. I wouldn't put it that way... Look what this demonic government is doing. I think we must first solve the problem of Israelis who've forgotten what it means to be Jewish. What a family... They're special. Yes, I'm crazy about them. Your grandmother... She's very impressive. She scanned me like an x-ray. Yeah, Grandma can read people like a book. It went well, right? Yes, of course. I'm so happy you came. I'll call you tomorrow? Sure. Bye, Yigal. Nava... Hey, brother. - What's up? - Come in. I gotta go, I'm on call. It's everything you asked for. Grenades, explosives, detonators... If I get caught, I'm screwed. Don't worry, brother. I'm serious. You didn't see or hear anything. Of course. Is it all there? Thanks, man. Good job. Take care. You've reached the Waldmans. Please leave a message... Only the northern mosque is exposed. The rest are surrounded by concrete. Here's what we should do: We should get a grenade launcher. You fire a few rounds into the mosque, they all run out, then you shoot at them from these hills... No way. The whole town would come out and lynch us. Chicago-mob style. We'd need guards to cover our backs, 3 drivers with jeeps, 3 snipers, 6 infantry... We'll never find 20 fighters. You said you'd recruit them. Those retreats are full of dorks. I get hundreds to attend, but not a single fighter. Hello? Nava! It's Puah. Oh, Puah... How are you? Thank God. Is Nava home? No, she's not. She... She just left to visit a friend. I see. Please tell her I called. No problem. Thank you. Goodbye. Hi, Yigal. You know, it's... It's serious. Marriage is a big decision. I just need some time, alone. Without all the pressure of meeting up. To see where... To make sure I'm certain. Fine. Take a break. You're not mad, right? I don't play games. I'm not looking for someone to play house with, or act all lovey-dovey. That's not me. I told you from the start, being with me means going all the way. Devoting your soul to what truly matters. But not every girl is cut out for that. You think those retreats are singles events? You think that's what matters to me? No! This nation is confused. It's being led into an abyss. You know what? You and your settlers are a bunch of cowards, more confused than everyone. Acting all diplomatic. I don't buy it, not your act nor your parents' act. Fawning over the leadership like it's some ideology. She'll find an Ashkenazi wimp she can control. Some university that Bar-Ilan is... I didn't even want you to go there. They're all pathetic hypocrites. You're smarter and prettier than them and they'd be lost without you, Gali. For them you're the black slave that organizes all their retreats and protests. Lift your head up high. Be proud. You're destined for greatness. "He shall bring total redemption." You'll be the greatest, you'll see. All is determined by the heavens, and God knows best. In blood and fire we will get rid of Rabin! In blood and fire we will get rid of Rabin! In blood and fire we will get rid of Rabin! Rabin is a traitor! Rabin is a traitor! I don't want to be the next victim! Dozens of right-wingers protested against the terror attacks. Tonight at Zion Square in Jerusalem, some tried to block the road. The police arrested 8 of them for not responding to their requests to clear the road. This government is weak, cowardly, pitiful and submissive. At dawn, a roadblock operation was launched. Dozens of roads in Judea and Samaria were blocked with burning tires, boulders and cars. Everyone took part, men, women and children. Stand over there. Ra'anana Junction. "Burying Zionism." Bibi Netanyahu marches ahead of the coffin. The protesters are blaming Rabin for the terror attacks. Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres illegally conspired with the PLO behind the nation's back, to disrupt democratic processes in Israel. The silencer... Very effective. Total silence. Glad we went for homemade. It might work better on a sniper rifle. Even bottles taped around the barrel would work better. Let me listen. Now that you are taking risks for peace... Naive Americans. They think this is Switzerland. What are you talking about? They fund our entire military. Where do we get our planes, missiles, tanks? We don't need money, we need faith. An American chopper... Look, I gotta be honest. I think you're not telling me the truth. - You're leading me on. - The radio's dead.... I want to talk to your parents. If Vardit's not interested, I'll back off. You got my hopes up! That's what matters to you now? A match? I thought you'd make an effort. I just want to know the truth. - You want the truth? - Yeah, I do. I don't have time for your bullshit! No one's doing anything. Everyone's just moving on, dealing with nonsense. Rabin sold us all out to please Clinton. Now Israel will pull out from all the cities. The way I see it, we're going to lose everything. Nothing will stop this man. Arafat must be laughing at us. I analyze it all and I see there is a way. Only one way, actually. What way? To take him out. I've always said we gotta take out Arafat. Cut off the snake's head. They'll just find some other Arab... It's Rabin we need to take out. Take him out? Everything is falling apart, and he just keeps going. Rabin is an expression of the peoples' will. - Harming a leader is total blasphemy. - The people's will? There's a small minority here that is totally atheist, and they're trying to impose a secular state on us. A reckless state, a state like all nations! Let's first give our organization a chance. It's unrealistic. Political assassinations are part of history. When Prophet Elisha orders the killing of the King of Israel, and Phinehas, who murders a leader to stop intermarriage, that's not a political assassination? The man's a tyrant, let him go out like a tyrant. What rabbi would permit you to kill a Jew? The laws of Informer and Pursuer apply to him. That's just talk, not a Jewish Law ruling. I assure you, any rabbi that knows what's going on, anyone from Judea and Samaria, will tell you that he's a Pursuer. Say whatever you want, but without rabbis' support you can't do anything. Your honor. Rabbi... Can the Rabbi spare a moment? I came to ask a question. And you are? I'm Yigal, a Bar-Ilan student. Go ahead, ask your question. It's about the Law of the Pursuer. - Regarding Rabin. - Pursuer? You said, whoever arms the enemy commits himself to death. You have to ask a rabbi about a Pursuer? If one sees a Pursuer, by the time he asks the rabbi, there will be no Pursuer and no one left to pursue. Understand? All the best, dear Jew. - Rabbi. - Yes, hello. I heard you say that the Law of the Informer applies to Rabin. So? So why not let the public know? What for? To cause a civil war? We've had civil wars before, like against Hellenistic Jews. We did. Unfortunately, today the secular Jews are stronger, Otherwise, we should have. You said that Jewish Law commands us to kill Rabin. - You cited the Scriptures. - I was jesting. Interesting. You told the whole class that if Rabin came to visit you'd shoot him at the gate. Listen, kid, Rabbi Shilo, Rabbi Lior and Rabbi Melamed, who are great Torah scholars, - wrote a letter to 40 rabbis. - What letter? Asking if they should warn Rabin and his cabinet that if they continue on this path, the rabbis will have to declare them as Informers by law. So if Rabin doesn't stop Oslo, Jewish Law sentences him to death. The only question now is whether to warn him. Enough said. This is an act of treason, and one day Rabin will be put on trial for his actions, just like Nazi collaborator Pétain. This prayer was written by three rabbis who ordered their students to cast a Pulsa de Nura curse on Rabin. How dare you curse the Prime Minister? ...the angels of destruction. Let the angels come and take away this wicked man... - They should take you! - Along with Arafat. May he be damned! Damned, damned, damned! Anyone who informs on Jewish lives or property, "He who kills him shall be rewarded." Maimonides himself said so. - But I didn't have the privilege. - What do you mean? Because he is still alive. Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Rabin is guilty! We could fire a missile right into his balcony. Innocent people will be killed. As if innocent people aren't being killed now... True. But his apartment is too high up. If Rabin isn't hurt, we're screwed. We only have one chance. I need to get closer. Hold on, what did the rabbis say? Each in his own way said we're obligated to do it. You have to choose, are you a person who faces reality or turns a blind eye, like a scared little girl. Okay, okay. - What's up, guys? - What's your problem? Come join the protest. C'mon! That Avishai... I'll tell you what we can do. We can put explosives in his water pipes. I drill a hole in the pipe, put some nitroglycerin in, then use the water pump's pressure to send it all the way up to his apartment. Really? What do you need for that? Just the diameter of the pipe. The diameter? That's it? Yeah, that's it. - Wait here. - Gali! Where's he going? I don't want to be the next victim! Hello, ma'am. Let me help you. No, it's okay. Thank you, young man. It would be my pleasure. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Have a nice day. Rabin is guilty! This isn't peace, it's terror! All clear. What are you doing?! The place is surrounded by guards. You wanna get caught? Come on. What will you do with that? We're not in Texas. The recoil will kill your arm. - So we won't buy it. - Show him the Beretta. Not that one, the 84F. It's a nice piece. "...contracts with broad coverage." "Some may cover an unlimited term, "meaning they are valid..." Hi. May I join you? It depends. On what? Don't listen to him. Come join us. - You study law too, right? - Yeah. - First year? - Yeah. - Where are you from? - Beit El. No good for me. Who asked you? - No good? - Meet Hayuta. - Nice to meet you. - I'm Margalit. Why is that not good for you? I can't bring home another settler girl. - Okay, so we won't get married. - Fine. - Could've been nice, though. - What's up? - What do you have there? - A pamphlet about Dr. Goldstein. By Rabbi Ginsburg. The living words of God. Margalit, what do you think of Dr. Goldstein? Again with your Goldstein? He's a murderer. He's a saint. - A saint? - A saint. The man slaughtered 29 innocent worshippers. Samson killed way more than 29. "Let me die with the Philistines." You don't admire him either? You two make a perfect couple. Samson was a prisoner who's eyes were gouged out. And Dr. Goldstein' had friends die in his arms! Wait. Let me ask you something. How could a man, a doctor, with a wife and kids, drop everything and sacrifice his life? - Sacrifice? - Yes. And how many Jews have died since then? That massacre started all the suicide bombings. Now buses explode every other week! The foundations had to be shaken. Now it'll take guts to finish what Goldstein started. Now you're talking. The next hero is the one who kills Rabin. - Enough of that talk, Yigal! - Why? He's got a point. - You're crazy. - Oh good, you got it. - You know who was called crazy? - Who? Hosea, Jeremiah, Amos. "The Prophet is a fool..." You're all talk. - Look who's talking. - Hayuta! I'm serious. According to Jewish Law, "he who kills shall be rewarded." Where'd you get that? Ask whoever you want. Who's your rabbi? My uncle's a rabbi, head of a yeshiva. - Is he well known? - He sure is. You're Benny Elon's niece, right? - THE Benny Elon? - Yes. - Cool. - Respect. We heard him speak. Ask him, see what he says. Shmuel! What's up bro? You're getting married? Who's the lucky girl? You're invited to Shmuel and Nava's Wedding Congratulations. You should come. Sure. Do I need Hamas' permission to speak? - You want to send car bombs to Nablus... - Absolutely! That's the only language you understand! How does that make you better than a terrorist? When you Arabs get hit on the head, you bend down... It's an act of treason... This government is weak, cowardly... Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres conspired with the PLO... And if Rabin is an Informer, it's no joke, it's Jewish Law. May he be damned! Blessed are You, O Lord, Who has commanded us regarding forbidden unions, forbade betrothed women to us but permitted those lawfully married to us by canopy and consecration. Blessed are You, O Lord, Who sanctifies His people Israel by canopy and consecration. Amen. With this ring I thee wed by the law of Moses and Israel. Consecrated! Consecrated! Consecrated! Jewish Agency seeks delegates to go abroad The Jewish Agency. Hello. I'd like to volunteer for a position overseas. I'll put you through to new recruits. Wait. I've already been an delegate, in Latvia. Latvia? Yes, as part of my military service. Okay, I'll set up a date for group dynamics. What is your profession? I'm a student at Bar-Ilan. Which faculty? Law. Great... Hello, are you there? I'm looking for a date... Okay, I'll hold. What delegation? Because of that girl?! - Lay off. - Have you lost it?! Friends, Earth is on the brink of destruction. The escape shuttle to Mars has 4 seats. You are 7. Only 4 of you will create a new civilization. You have 5 minutes to decide, unanimously. We have to think as a group about the future of humanity, - not about our own selfish survival. - Right. So we need to be in pairs. Have fun repopulating, if you know what I mean. - Let's send the pregnant woman. - Agreed. The pregnancy won't survive the flight. Let's send the artist, she's the youngest. - You're right. - Agreed. You need me, the soldier, to stop aliens from invading and attacking the artist. And to get her pregnant. Your words, not mine. So we have a soldier, an artist, we need two more. - Right. - Okay. I object. Object to what? - The artist. - Why? This is your "Eve"? - You're talking nonsense. - The Lord's Creation? Dude, it's just group dynamics. What's the problem? She's dressed like a show girl! She'll wear whatever she wants, and she's just as worthy. Her life is all about her physical needs. Folks, he's wasting our time. We have two more to choose. Let's vote for the artist. The decision must be unanimous. - Don't you want to be a delegate? - Just vote already! You people only act on desire, like animals. Come on, this is impossible. The mind must always prevail. - Be positive. Who would you send? - Myself. Why? - I'm an observant Jew. - How is that relevant? You want to start a civilization, right? A civilization of what nation? The Jewish nation? You live in the Jewish state, don't you? This is too much. Can you disqualify him? It happens to be run by secular Jews now. - Excuse me, can you disqualify him? - This guy's a clown... No, let him speak. Each and every one of you will have to fall in line. Someday soon this country will be run by Jewish Law. Understand? Come on already! Can we disqualify him unanimously? I'm sorry. You're disqualifying me? I'm disqualifying all of you. We interrupt this broadcast to report a suicide bombing just outside of Tel Aviv. A suicide bomber got on bus number 20 and blew himself up next to the Diamond Exchange in Ramat Gan. Prime Minister Rabin will be arriving at the scene to oversee the rescue efforts. He should be there any minute. Our correspondent is at the scene. The Prime Minister has just arrived and is surrounded by photographers. The number of injured is said to be 30 or 32, 5 of them in serious condition, and 3 in critical condition. 6 people were killed, the 7th being the terrorist. Let's get out of here. There was an explosion! Everybody move back! Stop! Move back! Rabin is to blame! Close off the area. Stay back! Rabin is a traitor! Rabin is a traitor! Rabin is a traitor! Many bystanders are surrounding the area, calling out violent chants at the Prime Minister. Rabin is next! Rabin is next! Guards are surrounding the Prime Minister and running with him to his car. I was there. The murderous acts of the enemies of peace must not keep us from solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict once and for all. In response to right-wing protests, youths demonstrated for peace on a train heading to Jerusalem. When this process is over, when we return to our natural pre-1967 borders, we may no longer be under a death threat, a constant threat of war. We'll finally be able to clarify our basic issues. The realization of the peace plan causes outbursts of happiness on the streets of Israel. No bro, all 4 busses are packed. Okay. What about sleeping bags? Everyone should bring their own. I don't have one. Ask Avishai, he may have a spare. Okay, I'll call him. Good. - Okay, bye. - Goodbye. Keep away from Avishai. Don't get him too involved. He's dangerous. Nah, he's a good kid. Poor fella. What's this? A hollow-point bullet. Tears you up from the inside. Rips you apart. Certain death. Amazing! You know Avishai is a snitch for the Secret Service. Turn around for a sec. I don't buy it. Oh no? He got arrested at a protest, showed the cops some ID and they let him go. He got the royal treatment. I've heard those stories. It's just slander. Then how do you explain that he has an apartment, two phones and a car? The guy's broke! What are you doing? Fifth rib. The Talmud says that the 5th rib is lethal, Kills the person for sure. - So Avishai is a snitch? - For sure. "...the good and the bad in them "are two completely different and polarizing values. Therefore..." Hi, Yigal. Margalit. What's up? I asked. What? The rabbi. Cat got your tongue? Rabbi Elon? No, I wouldn't involve family in this. Then who? Rabbi Aviner, my settlement's rabbi. And? I asked him if I should turn you in. You're kidding me. You're the one who tells anyone who'll listen. I see. Just kidding. I didn't mention your name. I just said, I'm "asking for someone." - "Someone." - Someone. So let me guess. He said it was a matter only for the greatest rabbis. He said lots of people asked him about it, but he thinks a Jew won't harm another Jew, so he told me not to turn you in. See? Bottom line, it permits me or anyone else to do it. Otherwise, he would've told you to turn me in. Right? Shut up! Can't we have a normal conversation? About what? My mother teaches Talmud, got her PhD at Union College. Just my luck, a Reform Jew! My grandma was one of the first religious feminists. - She used to wear a tallit. - Oh no! It's the Polish royal family! Don't tell me you studied Talmud at Bruria College. How did you know? Sounds like you're scared of strong women. Scared to death. What does your father do? He owns a factory. - What kind? - Paper goods. Nice. Who are you named after? How do you come up with these questions? Names are more important than what your parents do. As if Margalit is such a great name... Sounds like an old aunt. You're right, it was my aunt's name. She was murdered in Auschwitz. I was named after her. Sorry. So what does your name mean to you? It reminds me what happens when we depend on gentiles, when we don't have our own Jewish state and army. We'll kick the Arabs out of here one day. They have Mecca and Medina, let 'em go to their Allah. God promised this land to us. The People of Israel, the Land of Israel, the Torah of Israel. This triangle must not be broken. God helps those who help themselves. Those who act as heroes in the service of God. Nablus... - See Joseph's Tomb? - Yes. Wanna hold it? Don't be afraid. There's a left-wing protest tonight, I want us to go together. If Rabin shows up, we'll study his security protocol. We'll go as a couple, not to draw attention. We'll dress you up in a miniskirt, like a promiscuous secular girl. What is this, a teen detective novel? No. I've already tried to get to him. Your settlement has an armory, right? Yeah, so? I want to know where it is. It's by the gate, but there's a guard. There's no way you'd get anything out of there. Unless you drug him or kill him. Do you know any scientists? A right-winger, someone we can trust? Who could help us build bombs? There's one in the settlement. Dr. Averbuch, he's a big shot. Great. And most important, your uncle. What about him? Bring him to my retreat in Beit Hagai. It would mean a lot to me. Forget it. "The principle of survivability". I claim that once an organization has reached the goal for which it was established, it goes into survival mode and becomes vulnerable. And then, all it takes is one determined person to harm it. That is why guerrilla warfare will always defeat a cumbersome security system. I'm not just a military historian at Bar-Ilan. I've also written many books on Israel's wars... Listen up. When I get up to talk, I want your eyes on Rabbi Elon. He's over there. Watch how he reacts to what I say. So we'll know if he's the right man. For what? For being our voice. If anything happens to me, he'll explain my act the next day. All eyes on him. ...political negotiations put our country's fate at stake. If you're interested, check out my book. I'll be selling copies once Shabbat is over. I'd like to thank Yigal Amir for inviting me here. Good luck, man. He's done a fabulous job. Well done. Only you could bring so many students out here to witness the reality of this place. Thank you, Dr. Milstein. Stay strong. Go ahead, Yigal. Shabbat Shalom, everyone. Shabbat Shalom. I read this week's Torah portion, the story of Phinehas, and it got me thinking. Phinehas is a symbol of self-sacrifice, right? But when he slaughtered Simeon's tribal leader in public, be sure that no one applauded him. And yet he's the one who stopped the plague! The Talmud says, in the Sanhedrin tractate, that Phinehas even went to Moses and asked: "Moses, what should we do? "Should I kill this leader, "whose sins are the reason so many of us are dying?" And Moses, the great Moses... was speechless. He couldn't grasp what Phinehas had already realized. And the fact that the Simeonites allowed Phinehas to kill their leader, made them accomplices, and that's what saved them. Therefore God made an eternal covenant with Phinehas. He commanded over 12,000 warriors. The midrash even says that Phinehas is actually Elijah the Prophet. Friends... Democracy is the rule of the people, but what is the people compared to God? The public is but a fleeting group of human beings, as opposed to God's eternal authority. We will not yield! The secular state cannot judge us for obeying Jewish Law, because Jewish Law is above any worldly law. No need, it's the holy Shabbat. Shabbat Shalom. Well done. Great job, bro. Thank you. Yigal, that was amazing. Thank you. The people are with you. My brother... What do you say? You're awesome. - All the best to you. - Thank you, Rabbi. Rabbi. - Margalit. - Hi. Did you like the sermon? What say you, Rabbi? I understand you're an earnest law student. Stay away from that guy. He's no good for us. Shabbat Shalom. Oslo II September 28, 1995 The sounds of celebration here cannot drown out the cries of innocent citizens who traveled those buses to their death. We, gentlemen, will not permit terrorism to defeat peace. We will not allow it! If we don't have partners in this bitter, difficult war, we will fight it alone. We know how to fight, and we know how to win. I want to say to you, Chairman Arafat, the leader of the Palestinians: Together, we should not let the land flowing with... Carmela, how are you? Thank God. Yes, Vardit is engaged! They only just met. He's a wonderful boy, knows his Torah. I'll come by soon. Thanks, bye. - What does she want? - Vardit, come here. I brought you Dror. A good, quiet, religious fellow. - Are you doing this to spite me? - Seriously? Yes. Your worldview is so twisted. And so we are sharing this good earth today with the Palestinian people... What now? That villain wants to give those ragheads everything? Does he want to wipe us out completely? Not if someone does away with him first. What? Someone's gotta do it. Gali, stop talking nonsense. Someone has to save our people. He must be taken out! The Fast of Gedaliah is in 2 days. Why do we fast? What do you want from me? Every year on this date your fathers and forefathers mourn the murder of the Judean governor by a Jewish assassin. Gedaliah? What's he got to do with it? Did he go hug Arafat? Did he denounce part of his people? Yigal, you have to grow up, that's all. To settle down. Raise a family, and relax. You want me to be like you? Girls, go to your room, we'll call for you in a bit. Hadas, turn off the TV. You went to the army and it ruined you, ruined your gentleness. If I had known, I would have done everything to prevent you from going. You were such a refined, delicate boy. You could've been a real Torah scholar, with your sharp mind. Father, let me make this clear, you and I are nothing alike. As far as I'm concerned, you're a Diaspora Jew. You and I are totally different. You're so afraid, you made nothing of your life. You wait for the heavens to act for you. Watch that insolence of yours, no one knows what God's plans are. All the Greats will tell you... You think you're one of the Greats now? To be a great scholar, you must improve yourself, work on your virtues. "What does God require of you? "To do justly, to love mercy, and act humbly with your God"! - Shlomo, leave him. - I've got quotes, too! How about "Vengeance is His name"? Or "any Torah scholar who does not avenge is not a true scholar." You're being childish! - You're exaggerating, Shlomo. - I'm talking now! That Goldstein you admire, he murdered dozens of people in the mosque. A month later, what did we get? Two heartbreaking suicide bombings! Can't you see the connection? This vicious cycle of violence? Each side is convinced the other side started, like kids who can't see the cycle. Inviting murderers upon us? Teasing a billion Muslims around us? That's heroism? Your words turn the Torah into a path of fanaticism and cruelty. Read the papers! At the conference in Brooklyn, Rabbi Soloveichik opposed Oslo, but did not permit violence of any kind. Dad, 1,500 rabbis were at that conference in New York. 1,500! They stood there and ruled by majority that the Law of the Pursuer applies to Rabin! - Rabbi Hecht said so. - Even if it does, it won't be carried out by flesh and blood, but by God. If Redemption comes from murder, may it not come at all! Then how will Redemption come? How?! You want Redemption? Pray! You want to annul the Oslo Accords? Turn to politics. But this kind of talk will lead to war between brothers... Brothers... We were never one nation. We were tribes that led and tribes that feared, and when we had to we struck the insurgents. The People of Israel, the Land of Israel, the Torah of Israel. All three must go hand in hand! We're better off back in exile than waging a civil war. There is no land without its people! Harming the State? The Prime Minister? It'll be the biggest disaster for our people since the Destruction of the Temple. It'll take generations to heal such a wound! Wake up, sleepy ones from your slumber Better your ways and your deeds And may every one of you abandon his evil path and thoughts. Please, Shlomo, do us the honor. We came to hear you, not me. Please, go ahead. Do honor us by reciting "The binder, the bound" for the entire congregation. It is time for the gates of mercy To open The day I reach out To God And I will sacrifice to Him A burnt offering Saying: Lord, remember on this day of rebuke The binder, the bound And the sacrifice The binder, the bound And the sacrifice... Look at my mother For her joy has gone away The son she bore At the age of 90 Has gone to the fire And fed the slaughter-knife I ask for her Consolation I grieve her weeping And wailing The binder, the bound... There'll be at least 100,000 people there tonight. - It'll be chaos. - Then let there be chaos. Death to the Arabs- -THE LIAR- Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next Israeli Prime Minister, God willing, Benjamin Netanyahu! - Bibi! Bibi! - Only the Likud! Bibi! Bibi! Today the treaty for surrender and retreat known as Oslo II was submitted to Parliament. Boo!!! The predicted majority vote for this agreement is based on two pathetic vote-thieves! The Jewish people, this ancient, strong nation, rejects the great swindle they tried to lead it into. Even now the vast majority of the people support us, and if we all make an extra effort, in the upcoming elections, God willing, the Likud's National Camp will gain a conclusive victory! Bibi for Prime Minister! All of us in the National Camp salute you for your courage. Death to Rabin! Death to Rabin! Death to Rabin! Rabin is a traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Rabin is a traitor! Rabin is a traitor! Death to Rabin! Death to Rabin! Baruch Goldstein, you're our hero! Baruch Goldstein, we love you! Death to Rabin! Amir! Let me have some. Avishai, where are the posters from? From those two Jerusalemites. Here, take some and pass them around. See? He may be a Secret Service snitch, but he's with us in heart. In blood and fire we will get rid of Rabin! In blood and fire we will get rid of Rabin! Police state! Police state! To the Parliament! Thousands of protesters marched with torches to the Parliament. In blood and fire we will get rid of Rabin! When they spotted the PM's car, they pounded it fiercely, breaking one of the headlights before the driver escaped. Minister Ben-Eliezer received similar treatment, he stayed in his car at the risk of physical harm. After hours of heated debates, we now go live to Parliament, to hear the results of the vote on Oslo II. The government ratification of the interim Israeli-Palestinian agreement regarding the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has been approved by 61 to 59 votes. The government has earned the Parliament's support. Good morning, everyone. We now end our live broadcast from the Parliament's studio... ...The crowd in Zion Square stopped MK David Levy from speaking, with a constant barrage of loud booing. When Levy finished speaking, our correspondent asked him for his thoughts on the event: These incited people, not everyone, but part of them, who wave swastikas and use such terms as 'traitors' are very dangerous. If, God forbid, the sensible National Zionists will follow their lead, it will put everything at risk. I am certain that plenty of citizens reject that path. Zion Square hasn't seen this many protesters in a long time. The protest was organized by the Settlers' Council and the Likud party, but right-wingers of all stripes took part: the 'Our Land' movement called on its activists to join. Also prominent were Kahane's disciples, since, as they say, "they have no other home." Meir Kahane's son was carried on high, and the Kach flag was fearlessly waved. "The Tribes of Israel" Likud Chairman Netanyahu requested a meeting with me. On the day before I flew to the US. When I got home on Friday afternoon, I saw the protest. Likud slogans, people shouting "traitor" and "murderer." I said, it would be foolish of me to play on the hypocrisy of the Likud and its chairman. - Until the elections... - He stood there and spoke while seeing pictures of me as a Nazi. He asks to meet with me and organizes protests. It may only get worse before election day. Perhaps, if the Likud so decides. We are not the source of violence! Mr. Rabin, you are the Prime Minister. I can't coerce anyone except by lawful means. Saturday, November 4, 1995 May it be Your will, O Lord, that my mission be successful, that I go in peace and return in peace. And if I don't return, may my death atone for my sins. "Thou Shalt Not Kill" - Gentlemen, let us say... - Cheers! Blessed are You, O Lord, Creator of the fruit of the vine. Amen. Blessed are You, O Lord, Creator of spices. Amen. Blessed are You, O Lord, Creator of fire. Amen. Blessed are You, O Lord, Who divides between sacred and profane, light and darkness, Israel and other nations, the 7th day and the 6 days of labor. Blessed are You, O Lord, separating sacred from profane. Amen. - Have a good week! - Have a good week! Hagai, what's on TV tonight? 'Crocodile Dundee 2', great movie. I see. Well, I'm going to Carmela's. - How about you, Gali? - Seeing friends. Gali, call me if you're going. I'll be in the shed. Mom. What, sweetheart? Enjoy. Thanks. Please welcome the number 1 man in the peace process, your Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin! Good evening, good week. Allow me to say that I, too, am excited. I want to thank every one of you for coming here to condemn violence and support peace. I was a military man for 27 years. I fought as long as there were no prospects for peace. Today I believe there are prospects for peace, great prospects, and we must take advantage of it. I've always believed that most Israelis want peace, are willing to take risks for peace, and oppose violence. Violence is undermining the very foundations of Israeli democracy. It must be condemned wisely, denounced and isolated. This is not the way of the State of Israel. Rabin! Rabin! Rabin! 61 to 59 votes! That's amazing. Let's go look for the other guys from Bar-Ilan. They're probably by the stage. Aviv Geffen is up next. It's an honor and a pleasure to be here tonight at this rally, addressing you, - the peace-loving people. - Copy that. Close off the area, clear everyone out! Girls, please clear out. Other side of the fence! Whoever's not meant to be here, please leave. Officer! Check him out, please. No, him! - What are you doing here? - I'm with the van. - Stay by the vehicle, please. - No problem. Aviv Geffen! Check out that singer. Is that a man or a woman? - Is he wearing makeup? - Yeah. Didn't even serve in the army. Are you serious? Son of a bitch. What is he, a tranny? I guess so. That guy there, do you know him? The guy in grey? Yes, he's one of us. OK, I'm moving on. They're about to come down. No. 2 is about to come down, over. We need the Riot Police in the northern area, over. Who's that dark-skinned guy? He's undercover. Don't blow his cover. How's it going? What's up? To Peres's car, let's move. Where's the Riot Police? We need more policemen here. Peres! Peres! Shimon Peres! HQ, this is 50, No.1 is about to come down. Rabin! Rabin! Bring us peace, Rabin! Yes to peace, no to violence! Rabin, we love you! Mr. Rabin, what do you think of this amazing rally? INCITEMENT INCITEMENT A film by Yaron Zilberman PM Rabin succumbed to his wounds. Foreign Minister Peres was appointed interim PM. Six months later, Benjamin Netanyahu, head of the opposition, was elected PM. His victory speech never mentioned Yitzhak Rabin or his murder. Yigal Amir pleaded guilty and was convicted of Rabin's murder. A law passed in 2001 made him ineligible for parole. Yigal Amir never expressed remorse. Hagai Amir was sentenced to 16 years in prison. He was released in 2012. Dror Adani was sentenced to 7 years in prison, He was released in 2002. Margalit Har-Shefi was sentenced to 9 months in prison, but was released after 6 months. Avishai Raviv was exposed as an informant for the Secret Service. He stood trial and was acquitted. Yigal Amir insisted that he received rabbis' blessing to carry out the murder. No rabbi in Israel ever stood trial for incitement to murder.
