Everyone Has His Cross to Bear Sir... Please... Listen to me, Sir! Open for me, quickly! Please! What's this all about? Where do you think you are? Where are you going, madam? You're a TV announcer... I don't know anyone, but you have to listen to me... I'm on a show. What's going on? My daughter was abducted. Someone took my daughter. Have them look for him, damn it! You have the plan of the room, you know where the people are. Of course it's urgent! Have you seen Pascal? I can't accept such a responsibility... I don't have the right. We have to wait for our manager. He won't be long. You still can't get Versailles? Still busy. So at 4.30 this afternoon... ...your daughter left school to go to her piano lesson. At 5.15 the kidnapper phoned... ...to your husband's garage. I work with my husband. But he called me. What did he say? He said... Leave us alone! Scram, damn it! What did he say? Please be quick. He said my daughter was with him... that we shouldn't notify the police. And also... - 407. - Have you seen Pascal? He told me he'd call me back at 7.30... for the money. TF1, information. Superintendent Bolar, please. I have Versailles. Yes, Sir. It's Magnan. He's in his car. Good evening, Henri. I'll give you Noelle. She'll explain to you. Good evening, Superintendent. Lacoste here, Magnan's assistant. Well... I have a lady in my office... Mrs...? Mrs Girard. I'm sure she's telling the truth, but... You're taking care of it? Do you have photos of your daughter with you? If you go on air, we're going to choose one now. Of course. I understand. 033-36. - Which one do you prefer? - I don't know... Nothing better? - No, that's all. - That one. That one? Thanks. Very well, Superintendent. Thanks. What did he say? He's fine with it. But what happened at 7.30? The kidnapper didn't call? That's right, but my husband had contacted the police. That's why I didn't understand at the time. My husband stayed long on the phone... ...that the detectives traced the phone box. 033-36. So they went there? Yes of course. But when they got there, there was no one. They arrived too late. No, he must have been suspicious. He was on the phone at Versailles station. He must have seen the police, and he ran off. How would you know that? I'm sure of it, sir. He hung up on my husband, like that, all of a sudden... ...in the middle of a sentence. He called my husband a bastard. We must hurry, Sir, because he won't call anymore. Even for the money. He won't take any more risks. He'll kill her. Don't worry, Madam. We will broadcast your appeal on TV and radio... ...as well as in the newspapers. I'm on it. Thank you. I was scared that it wouldn't be possible. You are welcome. Francoise to production. Production. We're ready. We're waiting for you. - Camera 1? - Ready. Camera 2? One minute. Give me 17. Lower. Stop. Ready to go on air. Sit down. Set is ready. Don't feel overawed. Think about what you'll say. We can talk about it if you like.. We can write a short text, if you prefer. Production OK? If you have something to say, you will be more comfortable. I know very well what I should say to him. Don't forget, it's going out live. You mustn't let something inappropriate slip out. The slightest badly worded sentence, and the kidnapper may doubt you. So he has to believe you. Ready to go on air. I promise to be very careful with what I have to tell him. Whenever you're ready, Sir. It's up to you, Madam. We have plenty of time. I'm ready. Let's get it done. When I give you a sign, you'll talk, looking here. - There? - Set. Ladies and gentlemen. A drama forces us to interrupt the normal course of our evening. We ask that you excuse us. But we are certain that all of you... ...will appreciate our intentions. This afternoon, at Versailles... ...a little 7-year-old girl... Here she is on your screen. A little 7-year-old girl, Laurence Girard... ...daughter of city garage-owners... ...was kidnapped at the school gate, by a stranger. We won't say anything more. The slightest indiscretion could have serious consequences. The mother wants to talk to the kidnapper of her child. We'll let her speak. Keep calm, Madame. Take your time. Sir, it's to you that I wish to talk. I don't know who you are or where you are... But look at me... take a good look at me. My husband notified the police. He thought it would be better. But I didn't know about it, I swear. Now, you have nothing more to fear. It's me you'll be dealing with... me alone. There are no more police, it's just the two of us. You can call me... Only I will listen. No one will ever know what will happen between us. No one will interfere. Look at me, Sir. You can see that I'm telling the truth. I can't lie to you. Only one thing matters, you understand. Give me back my baby girl. I'll give you the money... I'll even bring it to you myself. Ask me what you want... I'll do whatever you want. Give me back my baby girl. Bring her back to me, please! - Here she is! It's her! - Get out, ladies and gentlemen! Get out! Step aside! Come on! Where was your daughter taken? Let me go! - How much is the ransom? - How is your daughter dressed? How much is the ransom? Step aside. How much is the ransom? You don't belong here! Get out! Has he phoned? - Did he phone? - No. Nothing, nothing! What's he waiting for? Where could he have taken her? What's he doing? She must be afraid. She's fragile, a little girl. She'll never be the same. No, Mum... Children forget quickly. In a few days, she won't think about it anymore. To think that she's alone with this guy...! Let's hope he's not crazy. Please...! Yes? Ah, it's you, Helene. Shit! Since the show, they all call. Cousins, neighbours, customers, employees... Everyone! It's too stupid. Why it's up to us what happens? Why are we doing this? If you hadn't told the police. Don't talk about that. Especially not that. Yes? No, Mr Clement, no news. If we pay, it's over. She can be with us. Stop it! What's done, is done. Yes? We think it's him all the time. Stop it! I know I screwed up. I know. I know... Listen, Mum... You have to understand Bernard, too. Such a ransom... He must give everything he has. He's ruined. What are you saying? I didn't call the cops because of the money. I don't care about the money! I'd give my life for my daughter. That's not what he meant. I'm sorry. Shit! Shit! Shit! Will that piece of filth make us wait a long time? Will he give me back my daughter? Stop it! You're driving us crazy! You're right, I'll stop. We all have to stay calm. We mustn't lose our heads. We have to wait, without getting worked up. We're joining one of our team at Versailles... ...where the emotion is intense. Over to you, Gilles Lacroix. Yes, and in particular in front of the Girard family's house... ...where everyone's waiting for news. People from Versailles, but also the surroundings. Madam. It's horrible... that woman we saw... No one has the right to do that. Even if that bastard returns her... No pity! Monsters like that have no right to live! It's inhuman! Why do they say that? You realise the danger? If he's listening to them... They must be silenced. At the window! It's Mrs Girard! It's her! Mrs Girard! - You have news? - We'll skin him alive! Mrs Girard! Mrs Girard! Every parent shares her anguish. Calm down! - Close the window! - You said it, you have to stay calm. Count on us! Hello? Say something! I'm watching TV. Let me tell you... ...people like you, with your money... ...when this happens to you, I'm delighted. I admire those who have the courage to do that. Well done! You piece of shit! Mrs Girard! Mrs Girard! Mrs Girard! Listen to me, Mrs Girard. I must speak to you. I know everything, Mrs Girard. I know where your daughter is. But open the door! It was me, Mrs Girard. I took her away. She's mine now. She's very happy. She didn't ask about you. Make way! It's me, her mother. Her real mother! No! That's enough! Stop! Stop them! It was I who kidnapped your daughter! No one will be able to find her! She will die! She will die! - Make way! - She will die! That woman's totally crazy. The police know her. Hello Dad. Oh, how awful! When I saw that on TV, I jumped in the car. Let go of me! Come, Mrs Girard! Mrs Girard! I'm not crazy! I'm not crazy! You do not understand. If she dies, it will be your fault! Your fault, Mrs Girard! Your fault! You'll see! Step aside! Bitch! Garbage! Kill her! Finally... How was it possible? - Want a drink? - No. The maid doesn't pick her up? Yes, every day. But at noon, she phoned me at the garage. Her mother was ill. I let her off until tomorrow. It's a long way from the school to here. With everything we see today... She wasn't coming back here, Dad. She had her piano lesson. And I would've picked her up at 6. Well then... We can't say it's your fault. Why do you say that? I'm not saying anything bad to you. Tell me... when he called at 7.30... ...he talked about the money? Yes. Don't worry about that. I'd just like to know. Did he give a figure? Knock it off! - Don't get mad! - Let's talk about something else. It's my concern. Hello? What did you say? The radio, quickly. 'France lnter'. Thank you, Helen my sweet. Someone's seen Laurence. The police intercepted the vehicle just outside Houdan. Alas, if the report is correct.. ...the little girl was none other that the girl... That's so stupid. But it shows that the police are on the lookout. It's not my fault, if idiots phone them! You think the police are continuing to do their job? Oh, discreetly, but they must continue. Are you going to shut up? You're impossible. Are you doing it on purpose? So... How much does he want? Listen... You want to know? You really want to know? 250 million. Did you hear me right? 250 million. 250... But how will you manage? You'll have nothing left. What do you want me to do? I have to pay. I'll sell my shares... get rid of stuff. But when he goes to call, maybe we can talk. Then... we can lower it. Do you really know what you're saying? So what if he asks for a billion, what do you do? - It's not your money... - Shut up! A wife who didn't bring you a cent... ...with her son who you've fed for 10 years... ...and who failed everything. If you only had your secretary salary, how would you pay? Would you please shut up. Certainly not. I think about that girl as much as you do. But that's not the reason about paying. Get out. Be quiet or get out! Alright. I warn you... After such a set-back, if you need money... ...don't count on me. It's over! Understood? Don't count on me anymore. Good evening. - Who's this gentleman? - It's Dad in his garage. - And that's me? - Yes. - Am I taller than the garage? - Oh yes, Mummy. What can we do? I want to talk to him, too. I want to do whatever he wants. Hush. Bernard, hush. We'll just keep waiting. Michel, go to bed... Even if you don't sleep. - I want to stay. - It might take a long time. You have to be able to replace us tomorrow. Go on. You're right. I'll try to get some sleep. Ouch! That's an E flat... It's not a D. You see? Mi, do. Come on. It's very good all the same. And you will see, tonight, after my lesson, I'll play everything. Without a mistake. Come on. Sylvie is waiting for you. You did your homework? See you tonight. What's that bastard waiting for? What's he waiting for? Oh dear! I broke it? Look at it. No. It's working. Give me a cigarette, please. Still nothing? Will you let me make you a coffee? I'd love one. I will do it myself. No, let me. Would you rather get some sleep? If he calls, I promise, I won't say anything. I'll get you up. It's not true, what I was told downstairs? You didn't hear the TV, radio? No, otherwise I would've come right away. - Where did you spend the night? - At my Mum's house. Mrs Girard knew. Sylvie, go make us some coffee. Oh, Mrs Girard, it's so horrible! She's coming back today? Certainly. Go make us some coffee. Alright. On the Channel coast... Hello? No, still no news. Yes, I'm sure your article's good, but I haven't read it. We didn't get the papers this morning. Yes. Thank you Sir. Thanks. They can't be talking about us every 5 minutes. What's up? A letter for you. Without a stamp. There's only your name on the envelope. If I'm in the way, I can leave. No, no! Come on, open it. Open it! Her score. She took it yesterday. Bois-d'Arcy Road. 10pm tonight. Be alone. Have the ransom in a bag. 4 km before Marvilliers, you will see a transformer. Behind it, you will find a package. Get back in your car, open the package. If you follow my instructions, I will give you Laurence back. Bois-d'Arcy Rd. 10pm tonight. Be alone. Have the ransom in a bag. 4 km before Marvilliers, you will see a transformer. What a bastard! He was here overnight. He took advantage of the scramble to put it in the mailbox. Oh... Maybe it's over. You don't seem to believe it. Yes I do. But I'd have preferred if he'd phoned. I'd have asked him to give her back to us. He's right. This is no proof. If we'd heard her voice... ...we'd be sure that she's still... I mean... I mean that... That she's OK. 195. 195. 196. 196. 197. 197. 198. 198. 199. 199. 200. 200. So here we are at 1 million. 100 million old francs. Are you sure they won't follow me tonight? Yes, Mum, I'm sure. I thought about it. There is nothing to fear. I don't feel calm about it. You shouldn't go alone, Madeleine. He's such a bastard... He's capable of anything. He can't do worse. Listen, Madeleine. I'll go with you. But that's crazy. We have to do what he said. I go alone. I'll hide in the car. Well, what are you afraid of? I don't know... Anything could happen. It could be dangerous for her. Bernard... You have to hurry. Don't worry. It will be fine. When you get back with Laurence... ...we'll give her a big party. Lets go! Out of the way, please! Let the car get out! He wants to shake us off! It's not possible! - Bring her back quickly. - Yes. - She's leaving too. - Where are you going? Are you broken down? Not at all. If you need help, don't hesitate to ask. I don't need anything. Please go away. - Mrs Girard. - Yes? - Mrs Girard. - I hear you. Mrs Girard. I am alone, as agreed. What do I have to do? Mrs Girard. - Sir, I... Mrs Girard. To talk, press the red button. So. You hear me? I am here. The police know nothing. I'm alone. Nobody knows anything. And the money? Do you have the money? It's here, in a bag. 250 million. I checked myself. Start right away and drive exactly 70kph. Yes, Sir. I am starting. So. I'm at 70kph. At the next crossroads, turn right. Yes Sir. I turned right. - Keep going. - Yes Sir. You will turn left... ...on the GC149. I'm on GC149. I'm continuing. Careful... You'll see a bridge. Yes, Sir. Stop on the bridge. I'm there, Sir. I'm stopping. I've stopped. I'm under the bridge. You'll throw the money and the walkie-talkie. - And my daughter? - You'll go back. On the right you'll take the path down. You'll come under the bridge. Your daughter will be there. She's waiting for you. Laurence? Laurence? Laurence? Hurry up! And the walkie talkie! Laurence? Laurence? Laurence? What is happening? I don't believe it! An almost new car! She'll know what it costs! She's obviously drunk! I won't have a car on Sunday. Anyone hurt? Your papers. Are you in order, at least? If it was my wife... She doesn't want to know you. - Don't feel sorry for her. - What a bitch! It's funnier than a movie! For God Sake! - Is it Mrs Girard? - She's the woman on TV. Go find a cop! Quickly! It's her daughter! How awful! - Her daughter is dead. - Whose daughter? Where did she find her? I have to go home, Sir. Let me pass. Call the police! There's a body in the car! - A dead body? - What's he saying? He's right! Get an officer! Let me pass! Go home! There is nothing to see! Can we can do something to help you? Let me get past! - Does your husband know? - It doesn't concern you! Do you want me to tell him? Hurry up! Let him get through. - What are you going to do? - Get out of the way! - Step back! - That's no reason to push. - Step aside. - Come on, get out. Don't stay there. Calm down. - And my observation? - Don't touch anything. Phone the CID. Block the street there. Thanks. Madam, you must stay. I don't have the authority to let you go. What for? I have to go. It's the law. We have to wait for the CID. I have to go! No, ma'am, please. - Give me my keys! - No, I can't. It won't take long. They'll be here very soon. Tell me... What happens about my insurance? Give me a break! Calm down. No one on the road, we said! Mrs Girard? Superintendent Bolar. Are you CID? What are you going to do? Get out of the way. Let us do our job. We have the right to know! We have children too! Please, madam. It's crazy. Out of the way! - Where did you find her? - Do you suspect someone? Come on, Madam. Scram, damn it! Come with me. No. I'm staying here with my daughter. Come on. No. Give me my keys. Mrs Girard, the car must stay here. I'm going back home with my daughter! Please, Mrs Girard.. Give me a break! Be reasonable. It's no use arguing. Give me a break. Leave me alone! Leave me alone! What's happening? Hey, you! Stop! Come on, stop! What are they doing? I don't want her to be taken... She's my daughter! I don't want her to be taken away! I don't want my daughter taken away! Leave me! We have to do an autopsy. I do not want it! Bernard! How? How? Leave us alone, for God Sake! Leave us alone! Tell me. - Tell me... - No, Mr Girard. No. She has to talk to me first. What do you mean? I found you there, alone, with your dead daughter. I have to consider everything. - I don't care! I want to know! - Mr Girard. There was a crime. You may well be the mother, but I have to question you. Alone, without witnesses. It's the law. I'm going to kick your arse! I'll kick your arse! Let me go! Let go of me! She's my daughter! I want to know! I want to know! She's my daughter! I want to know! Let me go! What happened? What happened? Chief... Chief! This anonymous letter was in her bag. Come with us. You need to be interviewed too. Come. Madam, come along. Marvilliers, a transformer... A package. The package... what was in it? "If you follow my instructions." What instructions? Tell me where my daughter is. I want to be with her. Whereabouts did you find your daughter? We have to go there right away. We may come across a clue. You don't have the right to separate me from my daughter. You can't see her tonight. The autopsy... They won't be finished until tomorrow. What are you saying? But you don't have the right. She's my daughter, she's mine. She belongs to the court at the moment. So... where did you find her? You don't want to talk, or you can't? In a criminal case, I only know 3 categories of people... ...victim, witnesses and suspects. A witness who won't talk becomes a suspect. Until you're prepared to speak, I'll have to keep you here. I simply must know, Mrs Girard. There's this criminal running around. You must help us. It's 7.30, Mrs Girard. I'll call you back as agreed. Give me your husband. I want to tell him where and how to give me the ransom. It's your fault. He saw you enter the station and killed her. Tell me where my daughter is. The package... what was it? What was it for? A walkie-talkie. He talked into that walkie-talkie? What did he say? - He told me to drive. - How far? On a road. Which road? To the left? To the right? To the right. Departmental 231. And then? I took the first left, then... GC149. And then? And then there was a bridge. Malherbe Bridge. And then? - He told me to stop. - Why? To throw the money, the walkie-talkie... And then? I found her dead. And then? And then? I saw her in my headlights, she was dead. - He'd put her in a bag. - What bag? - A large blue bag. - Where is it? I don't know, I threw it away. I carried my daughter. Brief Christian. Madam, come. We'll go to the scene. You want me to go back there? It has to be... You have to show us exactly. Mum. Why are you here? I took the plane this morning. Bernard's brothers have come, too. I have a headache. It's killing me. It's normal. You were so sick... The doctor gave you an injection. 2 o'clock... I slept so late? I'm hot, I'm hot... The phone... Why is there noise in the street? Oh... Laurence. Laurence! Laurence! Where is Laurence? Where did they put her? I want to see her. Calm down. Sit down. Where did they take her? I want to see her. We can't see her. - For what? - They can't give it to us. - Why? - We can't bring her back. Why? When there was a crime, it's the law. - They're going to let us see her? - Yes. - What are we waiting for? - Let's go. They told me that I have to bring her some clothes. To do what with? I don't know. It doesn't matter... The clothes she had on... They can't give them back to us. They need them for evidence. I must also warn you.. ...about Laurence. You have to be very strong. After an autopsy... ...they can't show her to us normally. You understand? She underwent many operations. You understand? How did she die? I swear it's true, they told me so... She didn't suffer. He strangled her. But she wasn't aware. She didn't have time. We'll take this for her... ...and that. Bernard. It's Bolar. Hello yes? Yes, it's Bernard Girard. Hello, Inspector. Give me the superintendent. Yes, Sir... Yes, I'm listening. Yes. What? How? Oh, good God... There can be no error? Are you sure that there can be no mistake? You have to excuse me, you understand... Thanks. Thank you, Superintendent. Oh, for God's sake in God's name... What is happening? What did he say? It was well worth begging for that garbage on TV. Ridiculing my son before the whole of France. But no, but no... When you was talking on TV... ...your baby had been dead for 4 hours. Laurence was killed at 5 o'clock in the afternoon... ...immediately after her abduction. But how? I told you so. Before paying... ...you had to at least be sure that she was alive. I don't blame you... You did well. We had to try everything. But with me, you can't know... I was starting to go crazy. Every 5 minutes, I was like, "It's your fault." "Without the police, it would have ended otherwise." Now I want him, that bastard. You hear me? All that matters to me now is to have him in front of me. Why did he kill her right away? - Mrs Girard! - Oh no! It's ridiculous! I thought about, while you were sleeping. Laurence left school here... ...at 4.30. Her piano teacher lives there, 500 metres away. If someone had grabbed her, she would've screamed. With the people around here, someone would've heard it. If she didn't say anything, it was because she knew him. That's why he killed her. He couldn't give her back to us... She would've given him away. I've thought carefully. The bastard must be someone we know well. A guy who's around us... ...that we see every day, who greets us, speaks to us. On the phone, on the walkie-talkie, I would've recognized his voice. His voice? He must've faked it. He knows everything we do, minute by minute. He knew that the maid wouldn't be at the school at 4.30. When did you let the maid have the time off? At noon. She phoned at noon to say that her mother was ill. That's what drives me crazy. But who, between noon and 4 o'clock, could know? Who's the footpath for? Don't let it bother you! I didn't tell anyone. I didn't know. I had lunch in Paris. Did you tell anyone? Try to remember. A customer? An employee? I only told the school. I spoke to the headmistress. The cops checked. The head herself warned Laurence. Apart from her, no one knew. - Is that Mrs Girard. - Yes it's her. Can't you leave us alone for one second? And Sylvie? She went to her mother's house. She stayed there all day. But how can you... And you, did you tell anyone about it? No, I didn't know anything. How so? Remember, I had lunch with a client. He was with Alfonsi. I made the appointment. Mrs Girard! Listen to us! Fuck off! Listen to us, Mr Girard. We have news for you. Very important, incredible! The ransom. The cops found the ransom. It was in a swamp, by the roadside. 400 metres from the point where you found your daughter. What could've happened? Was he doing it for the money, or... He's a lunatic. A lunatic. Not necessarily. He may have had to. Something unexpected. Is that also your opinion, Superintendent? Answer. I never answer without knowing. I have papers to get you to sign. Hurry up. We're going to be late for Laurence. It's 4 o'clock, I believe. Come with me. We both need to talk. We can stay here. - I've nothing to hide. - Please. Why did he leave all that money? I believe the ransom didn't interest him. In my view... ...what interested him... ...was that. This is the bag in which you found your daughter? Those blue plastic bags, what are they usually used for? For trash? Yes? Do you have a minute, Chief? See Berthelot. The garbage bag is no coincidence. It's a deliberate choice. He didn't care about anything else. He only had one goal. The scene he imagined with your daughter... ...to leave her dead, in the middle of the night... ...on a deserted road, in a garbage bag. He killed Laurence to get at you... you alone... ...to inflict a terrible sight on you... ...to torture you, to martyr you... ...and you, only you. Impossible. I have no enemies. I never did anything to anyone. Think carefully, Mrs Girard. You must speak to me frankly. Hide nothing from me. You've been married for 10 years. Apart from your husband, you never had an affair? - Or someone you rejected? - No. In the garage, in your business relationships... ...you don't have a personal enemy? - Among your neighbours? - No. - Your friends? - No. Your family? My family? Why not. But that's completely absurd. It doesn't make any sense. Look, I'm sorry but... ...we have to talk about this letter. Something is not logical. Not the text, but the way that it reached you. It hadn't been posted, correct? It was put directly in your letterbox overnight. Yes. It's possible. But outside, there were officers all night... Journalists. Photographers. If the assassin himself came carrying this note... ...he took a huge risk. And that doesn't fit with the character. On the contrary, from the beginning, he has always been... ...on his guard... very cautious. So we can ask a question... Was this letter posted in your letterbox... ...from inside the house? How would he get in? From where? I thought of the neighbors' garden, but they watched all night. It's Sylvie, when she arrived in the morning. - Who? - The maid. No. The officers opened the door for her. She ran to the porch and entered without stopping. So the letter was put in from outside. No one came all night. There was my husband, my son and my stepfather. You listening? There was just the 4 of us. What are you thinking? It's not possible. What do you want to make me believe? Listen, Sir, that's enough now. How, "but no"? But yes... They wanted us to say that we were responsible. If we'd been been thugs, we couldn't have been treated worse. They needed to separate us? I've nothing to hide from you. We both could see that... The three of us could. For a guy to be so mad at me... I would have had to have done something really terrible to him. I have never done anything shitty to anyone... ...man or woman... no one! I swear. Do you believe me? Of course, I believe you, Bernard. Only a madman could have done it. Why won't they admit it? Did Bolar's deputy have suspicions about someone? I don't think so. He said nothing. Bolar tell you anything else? Something more specific? No nothing. And you? What did he ask you? You were there as long as us. Nothing special. He asked me questions about my friends... ...about the girls I date. That's all. Your friends? You're still with your mother. We've never seen you with a girl. Why your friends? If I'd known that Sylvie wouldn't be at the school... I could have talked to them about it. A dark gray pleated skirt. A light gray bodice, red border. Duplantier family. A mesh sock. No, a pair of mesh socks. And a pair of white sandals in leather. And that's all. Here, madam, take your bag. Thank you so much. Madam, Sir... If you want to... check and sign here. Thanks. Keep this. Thanks. Madam, Sir... It's your turn. This way. Mrs Planchon... excuse me for disturbing you. Our maid can't pick up Laurence. I wouldn't like my daughter to be waiting on the footpath. Let her go straight at her piano lesson. I'll pick her up at 6 o'clock. Thank you, Mrs Planchon. Let the car pass. Here they are. Are the police after someone? - When is the funeral? - Do you want the killer dead? When are they going to arrest the bastard? Don't you worry, Mrs Girard, you'll be avenged! What did they do with your daughter? Are you taking her home? This guy needs to be lynched! As an example! Will you give a press conference? You didn't know about Sylvie's time off? No Mum. You were in my office. You heard very well. No, I swear. Anyway, I didn't pay attention. Why do you ask me this? ...and sent to the Keeper of the Seals... protest telegrams... ...calling for swift justice for the culprit. Also, in an agreement with the Ministry of the Interior... ...the mayor of Versailles has decided... ...to give at the funeral of Laurence Girard... ...on the day after tomorrow, the status of an exceptional event. The city will be in mourning. 10,000 people could follow the procession. No! No! It's going to be a carnival! I don't want it. But listen... ...10,000 people... it'll catch people's imagination. On the day of the trial, they'll remember it. I'll only think of one thing... That bastard will be there and laughing at us! No, I want us... the family. And that's all. Madeleine... A Mr Cortier called for you... twice. He didn't say why. - "Cortier"? - Do you know who he is? Yes, he's a customer. ...will be submerged in the North Sea. The poison will be transported to Belgium... where it will be loaded in Antwerp... ...onto a specialized boat which will take it away. I'm leaving you. Lucky for you... ...you have a son left. Come with me. Come on, come on. Go ahead. Why? Where are we going? Just do what I tell you. Hurry up, they're leaving. What do you want to do? Where are we going? They won't let us go. What are you going to do? Go and open. Why are you coming to the garage? Is there anything new? - If you have a statement... - It will appear tomorrow. The police gave you news? Will the funeral be televised? The mayor's coming to see you tomorrow? Can we confirm? You heard me at the office. Why are you lying? No I swear. Why this about the office again? At 4.30, when Laurence came out, what were you doing? You know very well. I was with a customer in Ville-d'Avray. It was you who made the appointment. - Mr Cortier. - Not true. Cortier phoned me. Why did he call? Because the police had been to see him. You went to his house at 5.15. It's possible. I don't always keep eyes on my watch. Anyway... how does that concern the cops? And at 7.30, during the call, you weren't there. Where were you? The night of the ransom, it was you who had the idea for the car. Yes. The journalists would have followed you, like now. Where did you go? Here. I went back there and I came out the back. Why? It wasn't worth it I was gone. - I thought it was better. - And after? After that, I went home. - After how long? - Right away. - Right away? - Yes. - And the letter? - Which letter? Who put it in the letterbox? Why are you talking to me like this? Who put it in the letterbox? I don't know. Who put it in the letterbox?! Shit! What do you want me to tell you? If you're losing your mind, I can't do anything about it! Michel, I beg you, talk to me, tell me. Michel... No. On the contrary, it's I who'll listen to you. Instead of beating around the bush with your innuendos... ...speak frankly, go ahead. Why are here this evening? You have no secrets from your husband. Why didn't you bring him with you? Come on, let's get him! We're not going to mess around! You're scared that he'll blame you for something? You've been making him happy for 10 years. Even if he did what you imagine... ...it's nothing to what he suffers now... ...compared to the happiness you gave him. But me? Did you ask me for my opinion? Did you ask me if I was happy to live with him? After the death of my father... ...why didn't we stay alone together? He hadn't been dead 6 months, when you were sleeping with that pig. Do you think I forgot that? Can you imagine what I've suffered since? Being there with you, every day? Smiling at him? Being polite to him? Keeping my mouth shut, so he wouldn't suspect anything? I was obliged to... He was so nice to me. Shut up. I've shut up for 10 years. Was this sham meant to last a long time? Michel! I couldn't take it anymore. I was tired of feeling ashamed... ...when you were having it off with him. Do you know what it's like to feel ashamed every night? Actually... ...what you seem to think, isn't stupid. I could very well have killed her. I had every reason to. Go ahead, hit me! Go on! Do it again! Again! Go ahead, hit me! What are you waiting for? Again! Go on! Hit harder! You have more strength, my poor mother. Yeah... And now, there's the worst thing you've got left to do. You have to tell the police... ...otherwise you become my accomplice. What's holding you back? Do you feel guilty? Responsible? Do you have remorse? Remorse is very painful. Though I don't have any myself. On the contrary. If only you knew what enjoyment I've had, these last 2 days... In my corner, watching you and your husband. It was great. "Mum... ...there's a letter for you without a stamp." "Bring Laurence back quickly. We need to give her a big party." Your daughter was in the trunk of this car, 10 metres from you. The cops... Are you coming or am I going alone? Why did you stay so long? What did you have to do here? Fast! Fast! Where are you going? The police are over there. I've nothing to say to the police. It only concerns us. No! Everyone has to know. The look on your husband's face, when he finds out it was this wimp... ...who pulled off such a stunt. At the trial, I'll show them who I am. You won't go to trial... They'll realise you're crazy. Did it take you 19 years to see it? But don't expect to put me in an asylum. I won't be found irresponsible. I'm normal. Perfectly normal. I had the courage to go all the way. Many would like to do what I did, but just don't dare. At the trial, I want them to sentence me to death. How better to piss you off, you and Bernard... ...for the rest of your life! What are you doing? You’re not going to save me, are you? That's enough, turn around. Otherwise I tell them everything! Listen to me. Stop! Stop! Nothing will prevent me speaking! Stop, I'll tell everything! What are you doing? Stop! Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
