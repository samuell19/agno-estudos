Interrupted journey, unfinished tune. All to breathe for love, I've lost too soon. Like a bright new day, light turned dark by noon. All to breathe for love, I've lost too soon. Bravo! Bellissimo! Why can't we just go get ice-cream, I'm hungry. Me too. Well because Michael's our good friend and neibour, and he gave us the best seats in the house. And because your gonna make a lot of money on his house of course. Right, smarty pants! Can we just get a boat! Honey there's so many other things we need first. -Just ?? what we say! -Why does he want to sell his house? Well because he wrote the whole opera. And it is so good that people want to give him a lot of money to take it to Broadway. -Where's Broadway? New York city. Excuse me? Is the dressing room down here? Thank you. Ok, so you guys want ice-cream? Then act like you're excited to be here, ok? Don't forget to say thank you. Oh, Vicky! I'm so glad you made it. Oh, Michael. It is so good! I cried during the whole thing. Thank you so much for the tickets. We absolutely loved it, didn't we boys? I'm glad you liked it. Oh, and before I forget. Your house closes one week from tomorrow. That's wonderful Vicky, that is great news. Well I... I guess we need to let you get to your fans, but eh... Look I'll call you tomorrow on the house and, thank you so much for those tickets. Thank you for coming by, good luck on those buyers. We'll see you boys later. Hey, come by tomorrow, I've got some music for you. Brilliant, Michael. Absolutely brilliant! Did I tell you guys that I met someone I kinda like. He's gonna come by this week and... meet both of you. Does he have a boat? -I don't no. -Ask him okay? Okay. We don't need... and don't want another dad. -But what if he has a boat? -Shut up, Kade. Billy! What about me? Your dad's been dead for... almost 2 years. Don't you think I get lonesome, sometimes? When you get lonesome, just let us know. and we'll go and do something. -Yeah, we'll talk to you. That's nice. But I'd kinda like to have an adult to talk to, once in a while. Could you talk to the ladies at the office? It's not quite the same. We don't need another dad. I love you! Sleep good. -I love you too. -Did you let Boo out? -Ooh! I forgot. -Then go and do it. And don't forget to lock the doors. Then come back and give me a kiss goodnight. Mmm... I love you. -I love you too. Sleep good. Mom? I've been thinking. I guess it's ok to go out with that guy, once in a while, but... no ones ever gonna take Dad's place. Don't worry sweetheart, no ones ever gonna take dad's place. You sleep good. Now stay out of trouble. -Excuse me? -Yeah. I'm looking for Michael Chambers, do you know where he lives? Yes he lives right over there. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Marcela... What a surprise. I thought you were in Europe. How long have you been back? I want to come in Michael. Why, certainly. Of course. You have stolen my music for your opera, Michael. And you have sold it. You lied to me! You made me believe that my music was worth nothing! And now look what you have done! You're gifted, Marcela. You've always been gifted. We can work something out. -Stay away from me! I intend to tell the world, exactly who and what you are Michael. Because you are a fraud and you're a cheat. Please, Marcela. I can pay you. With what, Michael? Money that already belongs to me. You are such a fool, Michael! -Be quiet! And you can forget about New York... Because once I am through with you, you won't even be able to get a job teaching music in high school! -I said be quiet! -I will not! I... trusted you! Because of you, I believed that I had no talent. And all along... it was you who had no talent. Enough! How can you possibly live with yourself, knowing exactly who and what you are. Silence!! What...? You scared me. You gotta call the cops, Mom. He killed her! Wait... what... What are you talking about? I was in the bathroom, Mom. He killed his wife! -Who, Billy? -Mr Chambers. Oh, sweetheart, the Chambers are artists, they're temperamental people. I've heard them argue lots of times. No, Mom. This is for real... He killed her! I know he did. Billy, look it's... it's 2 o'clock in the morning. You really want me to call the police and have them come out and... and wake up the entire neibourhood just to talk to Michael? Well, I'm not gonna do that. I mean we have lived next door to the Chambers for 5 years, and they have been nothing but the greatest neibours that anyone could ask for. Now I want you to go to bed. And next time you ask for a double, whatever that was... at 11 o'clock at night, just forget it. No, Mom. I'm telling you... It wasn't the ice-cream. -He killed her! -Billy, go to bed, We'll talk about this in the morning. -But Mom! Go... to... bed...! Billy? Shut up Kade and go to sleep, it's 2 o'clock. Eddie, it's me. I gotta talk to you guys. Let's meet at your place, and then we can go to Blue Heaven. Yeah, we can eat there. And call J.J. Hurry! Billy? Billy? Oh, man! When is that kid gonna get a clue! Come on, guys, let's go. Okay, if you killed somebody, what would you do with the body? When no one was looking, I'll strap it on the space shuttle, then send it into orbit. -Come on, man, this is serious. -I'd put it in the trunk of my car, then drive as far away as I could and dump it into some river. -Okay that's cool, man. -Okay, but... what happens if you can't get it out of the house because, you think someone might see you? I'd burn it in my furnace! Come on, man, there'd be smoke coming out of your chimney in the middle of Summer. And it would stink like Eddies dog. -Hey man, leave Butt Kiss out of this. I got it. I'd drop it off the Sears Tower, and I'd put a little note in her pocket that says, I've lived a horrible life. Everyone would think she committed suicide. -Jimmy, you're a genius. -I know. I'd cut it up into millions of pieces with a chainsaw. Then, I'll flush 'em down the toilet. -Hey man, I'm eating! -Now that's sick! -That is gross. I'd put it in the freezer! Man, you really gotta do something about that brother of yours. If I had a plane, I'd fly over the ocean, then drop the body. If I was building a house, I'd cement the body under the foundations. Hey, hairball. You remember the deal, don't you? You're only allowed to sit there if you keep your mouth shut! One more word out of you and you're outta here. I'm going into Chambers house to find the body. Who's with me? -You can't do that, man. I'll say it again, I'm going in. Who's with me? -How do you know he's not in there? -'Cos I saw him leave. What if he comes back while we're in there? He won't. He teaches at the University. He won't be home until about five. -That's the one! -Got a ladder? Yeah, but it's too short. Are you sure that all the doors are locked? -I'm sure. -It'll reach across. Let's just forget the whole thing and go swimming. No, man. I got an idea. How long's your ladder? It's too short, it won't reach. Yeah, but I'll bet my sweet butt, it would reach from your bathroom window, to that window, right there. -Eddie, man. You, are the genius. -Yeah, man. Great idea. We're wasting time here. Where's the freakin' ladder? Their butt! -We can do this! -Straight along. -Let's go. -We can do this! -Straight, straight. -Come on. Up, up, up. Be careful, watch the couch! Watch the piano! Come on, you guys, let's go! Careful, careful! Turn left. Watch out for the couch! Come on. Watch out for this thing, come on. Up the stairs. Careful! Hold on a minute. -Mom's gonna kill me! -Relax, man. Look at it this way... When we find that body and the cops put butt-head in jail, your butt's gonna be famous, man. All out butt's are gonna be famous. Yeah, come on, let's go! Watch out, a little bit to the left. Careful! -Come on, be careful. -Careful! -Easy! A little bit more. A bit to the right. -Left, to the left! -Come on, Eddie! Come on, we're almost there. A little bit more! Up, up, up, up. Come on, you guys, we're almost there! -I think we've got it. -We got it! -Yeah! All right! Okay. If somebody goes with me, we can find the body twice as fast. I'd go with you, man... I really would, it's... just... somebody needs to be here, to warn you, just in case Chambers comes home. You're just afraid you might break your butt! -I'll go. -You're too little -I'll go, man. -All right! Okay. When we find the body, we'll let you know. Call 911 and get the cops over here as fast as you can. Got it! -Got it, man. All right. Let's go, man. -Don't bust your butt! -Be careful! -Careful! -Are you okay, man! Phew! Come on, let's go. Get outta there! Get your butts outta there! Chambers is home, man. Chambers is home. Just kidding, guys. That was just a test to see if the radios were working. Hey, that wasn't cool, man! That was good! That was a good one! -What a jerk! -No kidding, man. Doctor Chambers, there's a gentleman on line 2, he's enquiring about a Marcela Janowitz. This is Michael Chambers. Marcela... No I haven't seen her for several years. I didn't even know she was in town. No, I never saw her at the opera. But please tell her, I'd love to see her if she has the time. I will. Certainly. Goodbye. Marilyn. -Yes, Doctor Chambers. I don't know what's come over me, but, I'm not feling very well. I think I'd better go home. Would you be so kind as to cancel my remaining classes. Certainly. I'd cut it up into millions of pieces with a chain saw. Then I'll flush 'em down the toilet. Well? Open it! Me? This is your idea, you open it! You were afraid of a couple of dolls. -Hey man, watch where your going. -Come on, let's go. Billy, help me! Help me, Billy! Billy... What are you doing? -I'm just kidding, man. -The body can't be in the fridge. I know, but check out these pickles, man. Get outta there, he's home! This is for real, get outta there! -Have you lost it? -They're great! Sure you don't want one. I'm sure, come on. Come on, hurry! Hurry! You gotta help me! I'm trapped in here. You've gotta figure a way to get Chambers attention long enough, so I can get outta here. And don't call me, Chambers will hear you. -Hi, Mr Chambers. -Well Kade, what can I do for you? You told me last night to come by and get some sheet music. Well Kade, I've been very busy lately. I haven't had time to think about it. Could you possibly come back tomorrow? Mr Chambers! You don't understand, I gotta have that sheet music. You said you'd have it for me. -Yes I did, didn't I. Well wait here. Billy...? Here you are. Yes! I just want you to know, you've been the best teacher I've ever had, I'm going to miss you a lot. Thank you Kade, I'll miss you too. Now have a nice day. Oh, Mr Chambers? Can I have your address so I can write to you sometime. I don't know what our new address will be yet. -I've got to go, Kade. -Did you see the Jazz game last night? I've gotta go! Billy, where are you? I'm in his basement. I couldn't get out the back door because it was locked from the inside. I'm gonna stay in here until he leaves. -Don't worry, if he kills you, we're all witnesses. We will nail his butt to the wall. Thanks. I'd put it in the freezer. Come on, Billy! Talk to us, man. Is he alive? -Are you okay, man? -Billy, where are you? Chambers probably found him! He's probably dead meat by now. -I'm calling him. -I don't know, man. Hey, we've waited long enough. Talk to us, man. Talk to us. All right. If we don't hear from him in less than 5 minutes, I'm going in there and doing some major butt kicking. He did kill her! Her body's in the freezer! I knew that. Wait! He killed her! The body's in the freezer. He killed her! He killed her! -He killed her! -Quiet, now get in here! Now you can not go running into a business, yelling, "he killed her", "the body's in the freezer". Now I want you to sit down. Come on. Now what is this all about? -Chambers killed his wife! -The body's in the freezer. One at a time. Chambers killed his wife. We've got the proof. Yeah, he killed her. He put her in the freezer. -He killed her! -Quiet! Who's freezer? -Chambers. Yeah, he killed her. He put her in the freezer. What were you doing in the Chambers house today? Looking for the body. Me and Jimmy were. Hey, it was his idea, honest. Did Michael know that you were in his house? Didn't I tell you to drop this whole thing last night. But Mrs R, he saw her body in the freezer! You're in big trouble, bud! Wait a minute. You're in big trouble, bud. Mrs R, this is freakin' front page news There's a body in a freezer, that someone's killed. And he saw it. -Yeah, he saw it. He saw it in the freezer. Okay, so let's hear it, Billy? What did you see? Go on, tell her what you told us, Well? Go aheah, man. Tell her what you saw. Chambers emptied his freezer, and put his wife in it. I know he did. Did you see Caroline Chambers body in the freezer? Well... I didn't see her body in the freezer. -What? Oh, my gosh! But I know it's in there, because he's got this stuff on the floor and it's melting But you said you saw a body in the freezer! All right, so what you're saying is that you... didn't see in the freezer and you didn't see a dead body? Chambers came in, just as I was about to look in. You know, Billy... you are in big trouble, bud. All right, everybody outta here. Come on, I've got work to do. Come on! And, I am going to talk to you later, young man. I want you to take your brother, right now and go straight home, and I don't want to hear that you've left the house. I could have been killed by that ladder! Yeah, this whole thing smelt funny, right from the beginning. Sure did, man. Billy? Shut up, Kade. I don't wanna hear it. -But Billy? -I said, shut up! Michael, did you know that while you were at work today, you had some visitors. Yes I did, but I wasn't sure exactly who it was. Billy? It was me, and one of my friends. And tell Michael, why you were here. Last night, Billy thought what he heard was you and Caroline arguing. Why that's impossible, Caroline has been in New York since Thursday, apartment hunting. I can't believe it, I forgot. She told me she was going to New York. Well, then this is ridiculous, I am sorry, we should... No, no, Vicky. no, please. What does Billy think he saw? I want to know because you see I think I have a very logical explanation. Well... he thought he saw you grab Caroline, I'm embarrassed even to say that. You know I, I blame this whole thing on television. Anyway he was positive that you, killed Caroline... Wait, wait, it gets much better... and that you hid her body in the freezer. -In the freezer? -Yes, in the freezer. -Oh, I'm so embarrassed. -Well don't be Vicky, and I hope you haven't been too hard on Billy. He's bright, and very observant. You see, he did see something last night. I've been working on a rewrite of the opera, and I asked a student to come over and rehearse one of the scenes. Sometimes that's the only way I can tell if my writing is working. But I'm afraid that particular scene we rehearsed was rather dramatic. You know, I thought maybe that's what happened, it certainly makes sense. Doesn't it, Billy? Forgive me, Billy. I'm afraid we've frightened you. I'm very sorry. Excuse me. Billy you are gonna get it, I mean you have really embarrassed us now. Honey, don't do this again, okay. It's Caroline, she's just found the perfect apartment. Vicky's here with Billy and Kade. Certainly. She'd like to speak with you. Thank you. Caroline? Hi. I'm gonna miss you so much, and I guess I won't get to see you to say goodbye. I love you too. Will you promise that you'll stay in touch. Oh, I will. Okay, Bye-bye. I am really gonna miss her. Look, we'll just see ourselves out. Hold on darling, I'm gonna see them to the door. Thank you so much for coming. And again, Billy, I'm sorry for frightening you I'm sorry too. Oh, and before I forget. I have a list of a few piano teachers I can recommend without hesitation. Oh, thank you very much, I appreciate this. I'll call them tomorrow. And Michael, please, stop over and say goodbye before you leave. Absolutely. Now just promise me that the next time, you'll come to me first, before taking the law into your own hands. Okay? -Ok. -Do you feel better? -I feel kind of dumb. Well, it's over and done with. Forget it. Michael has already forgotten about it, I'm sure. Now I want you to do me a favour. Remember the guy I told you about? The one I think is pretty neat. Well we're going out tomorrow night. No pranks, okay? Best behaviour? -Ok. Can I have my friends over and watch a video? I'll think about it. Now come on up to bed. That's enough, Kade. It's time for bed. Did Michael give you that piece? That's from his opera, isn't it? -I think so. Well, what's it called? -Marcela Jan... something. -It's pretty. Okay, come on, both of you. Up tp bed. Mr Chambers is lying, he killed the lady. What did you say? Mr Chambers is lying, he killed the lady. You heard what he said, that was his student, and they were practising a scene from his opera. They weren't pretending, because she never got back up after he pushed her down. She never got up? Wait a minute. How do you know that? -I saw them fighting and yelling. -When? -When you went to the bathroom. -You saw what I saw? Why didn't you tell me this sooner? Every time I tried to tell you, you always tell me to shut up. I knew he was lying, I could feel it. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. He's gonna try and get rid of that body tonight, I just know it. We're gonna have to take turns watching his house Okay, it's 11 o'clock. We got 7 hours 'til it's light. You tired? No. Okay, then you take the first 3 hours and I'll take the last 4. Okay. Do you think we should tell Mom? No, Mom thinks Chambers is an Angel. If you see or hear anything funny, just wake me up. Okay. I gotta look into that freezer. What are you doing? I was just gonna wake you up and you screamed. What's the matter? -Nothing. What time is it? 2 o'clock. Did you see or hear anything funny? No, but the music is still turned up real loud. -The music is still on? -Yes. He's up to something. We gotta see what he's doing. Come on! Stay here. Come on, this way. Stand still. I can't see. Well you're heavy! Can you see him? Sort of. He looks funny. He looks short, and he's sweating a lot. -What's he doing? -I dunno. What's that sound? I don't know. -Do you know anything? -I don't know. You've gotta get down. You're too heavy! -Do you see anything? -No. Just the movers getting the last of the furniture. I've gotta figure a way to get to that freezer. -They just brought it outta the house. -What? -The freezer. -The freezer? Get me the binoculars. We've gotta talk to Mom. I'm telling you Mom, there's a lady in that freezer. You gotta believe me. If they put that freezer in the truck, nobody will ever know! As soon as I'm finished eating, I'm calling your Grandmother. I'm sending both of you away for at least 2 weeks. You guys are driving me crazy with this. But Mom, you've got two witnesses now. Kade and me. That lady wasn't Mrs Chambers, and they weren't practising any scene from any stupid opers. It's true Mom, it really is. -Michael. -Morning Vicky, boys. Caroline called, just a few minutes ago. She doesn't feel we have room in the new apartment for our freezer. Rather than going through the hassle of moving it and storing it, we thought maybe you would like to have it. Actually Vicky, you'd be doing us a favour. -We'd love it, thank you. -You're most welcome. I'll have the movers bring it over this morning. I've already cleaned it out. -So what are your plans? Well the movers will finish up with the piano, some time tomorrow morning, and I'll be catching a plane some time around noon tomorrow. So if I don't see you again, thank you for being such wonderful neibours and friends. Oh, I am sure gonna miss hearing you play that piano every night You're very kind. Well goodbye Billy. Goodbye Kade, and keep practising and you'll be famous, I promise. -Goodbye. -Goodbye Michael. Shame on you both. So help me, if I hear one more word about a murder, I'm gonna murder you. Now go and find something to do, or I'm gonna put you to work cleaning out that garage. Move! Thanks. Here you are. I'm looking for Michael Chambers. Michael Chambers, Michael Chambers, Michael Chambers... -Come on. -What are you doing? Let go! -Shut up and come with me. -Just let go! She was last seen, at the corner of Centre and Seventh. That makes sense, that's the bus stop right below our house. Are you sure this is the woman that asked you where Chambers lived? Yeah. I wonder where he put the body. -Kade? -What? Come here. Where have you heard that sound before? -Holy cow! -Come on, We've got to go get the other guys. This is the woman Chambers killed. -You said he killed his wife. -Okay, I was wrong. When Kade let Boo out 2 nights ago, this woman talked to Kade, and asked him where Chambers lived. So how do you know she went to Chambers house. Read the name on that. -Where'd you get this? -Kade got it from Chambers, the morning after he killed her. She must have taken it to his house that night. So do you still think the body's in the freezer? Oh, not any more. Last night he buried it under his house. You mean he dug up the cement and buried her? No, their house is like ours. In the front there's a crawl space, and in the back, there's a small basement. Last night he pushed the piano out of the way... Gimme this. I'll explain it. Then he turned up the radio, real loud, so you couldn't hear him pulling up the boards. Then he dug a hole in the dirt under the house, and that's where he buried, Marcela Janowitz's body. I wonder why I didn't think of this until now. When it gets dark, I'm gonna dig her up and prove it. Now it says on the piece of paper there's a reward. I don't know how much, but if you guys help us out, we'll split it 5 ways. Now... Who's with us? -Man, I just got the shivers. -Me too! When this is all over, man, you're gonna have shivers running up and down you fame spots. I think I'm in love with your mother, man. -Shut up, Eddie! -He seemed like a cool guy I forgot to ask him if he had a boat. I gotta feeling, man. You should've told this when we were half brothers. Yeah... Come on, guys. We got work to do. -Okay, everybody got the radios? -Got it, man. All right. Eddie, you got 2 radios. You're the only one that can call me. This ones to call me, and this one's to call J.J. and Jimmy. -Got it, man. -Got it, man. All right. This is the plan. Mr Chambers starts practising at 9 o'clock. He quits at 10. That'll give me exactly 1 hour. J.J. you go out on the porch roof, and watch the front of the Chambers house. Jimmy... you go in the kitchen, and watch the back. Eddie... you and Kade, stay in the bathroom. When I find the body, I'll call Eddie. Kade, as soon as Eddie gives you the signal, hit the redial button. I've already programmed it for 911. Okay. It's time. Okay, guys. I'm going under. We were right! I can see where he took away the floor boards. And the ground under me is so soft, where he buried the... the body! Stand by. I'm gonna start digging. It... its 9:30. How deep did he bury this chick? Come on, man, haven't you found anything yet? Nothing yet, but... I gotta be geting close. You're sure there's a body under there? I'm sure. Wait a minute, I hit something. What? What did you hit? I dunno, something hard. Maybe it's her teeth. I can't talk, the piano's stopped. Don't call me. Darling, how are you? Oh, I'm just siting here practising in this... empty house, missing you desperately. He hit something hard. I think it's her teeth. Caroline, someone just knocked. Can I call you back. Come on, guys, call me so I can find the stupid radio. Jimmy, shall we call him? I haven't seen anything yet. I think we better wait. J.J.? J.J.? J.J.? Go check on J.J. J.J.? -What? -Did you see Chambers? No, why? What do ya bet, he dug up the plumbing, and feels too stupid to tell us. I'm calling in. -No, wait! -Hello? -Hello, is Eddie Balser, there? Hold on. I think it's your mother. Yeah. You were supposed to be home a half hour ago. Get your butt home right now! And if Jimmy or J.J. are with you, you tell them to get their butts home too. -I really gotta go, man. -No wait! Just stay for 5 more minutes. Please... Okay, 5 more minutes. Then after that, I'm outta here. -What are you doing under here, Billy? -Nothing. I see you've been digging. I couldn't fool you, could I, Billy. Things have become very complicated, Billy. I never intended to kill anyone. You have to believe me, Marcela was going to ruin everything for me. I couldn't allow her to do that. I won't ruin anything, I promise. You can move to New York, and I won't tell anybody. I wish it were that easy, Billy. I really do. It's been 5 minutes, man. Guy's we really gotta go. -Wait Eddie, but... -I'm sorry, I gotta go. -Wait Eddie, but don't go. -Come on, man, I really need to go. -Please, Eddie, just stay. -Would you get off my leg. Gosh. -So, what's up, man? -My Mom called me, We better get home quick, or we're gonna be in big trouble. Guys, come on, stay for just 5 more minutes. What about the reward? -Billy's gonna be just fine. -Come on, guys. We need ya. Come on, where you guys... Guys... I need you to come with me now, Billy. -Where? -Just for a little ride. -Why? -Because we have to... O... okay, but I have to ask my Mom. Your mothers not home, Billy. I saw her leave, earlier. Billy, Billy, can you hear me? Hey, man, do you really think we should go? Hey man, when are you gonna learn to trust Eddie? Like I said, there's no body under there. He just dug up the plumbing, and he feels too stupid to tell us. Let's get outta here. Hurry! I found the body! Chambers is coming! Run! Go! Hurry! Go, Go! Go, Go! Move! Get your butt off my face. -I was here first. -Get outta my way. Shut up and hide! You take up too much room, Eddie. -Watch it, man. -Be quiet! -I was here first. -Shhh... -He's coming. -Hurry! Turn off the light! You shouldn't have run away from me, Billy. Come with me. Mr Chambers? You touch, Billy... and I'll break your legs. If you kill him... you're gonna have to kill me too. I... I'm with, Kade. You touch Billy... you're gonna have to deal with the man. They don't call me Puerto Rican, Mexican mutilator, for nothing. You touch Billy, man, and I'm all over... your butt. I love you, Kade. -Are you okay? -I'm fine. -Thanks, guys. -Your the best, man. You did good. This is my house. Those are my boys! What happened! The boys found a body buried under the house next door. All indications point to a homicide. We've been on this case now for... about 2 days now. It was just a matter of time before we cracked it. Hey man, if Billy's little brother hadn't called the cops, we'd probably be buried too. Does this mean our butts are famous. I understant that it was you who found the body, is that correct? We found the body. If it wasn't for my little brother, we would've never figured this thing out. Ms Janowitz's father, Henry Janowitz, founder of Janowitz Inc, has issued a cheque for $50,000, as a reward for locating his daughters body. The 5 boys have agreed to split the reward equally.

(I quiver, whenever I look in your eyes.) (I get the shivers...) (Riding, a rollercoaster.) (A tidal wave bowling me over.) (You got the look, You got the look) (You got the look) (That's got my body shaking.) (Gyrating, yeah.) (Shivers... up and down my spine.) (Shivers... it's like lightning, striking.)
