You know him? Oh yes! I know him. He's got a collection belonging to us in his cellar Oh those! The Etruscan antiques -Have you heard of them? -Heard of them I have to carry them up from the beach, when they were salvaged The whole town had a hand in that -Your property,Monsieur? -I wish they were No,I've only come to collect them They belong to a London museum. I see. Won't you have that one with me? Thank you! Good luck! Kabarta to be grateful to you! We don't often get strangers around here Really? Well,it is rather out of the way for visitors,isn't it? You'll give us a new topic of conversation -Good evening, monsieur! -Good evening! I'm sorry to have kept you waiting That's quite all right Your room will be ready in five minutes Good Will you fill out the registration? Certainly There is a landslide on the Tunis road I couldn't get past I had to leave my car there Is there a garage in the town that could bring it in for me? I'll get somebody to see to it. Thank you so much! Quite hopeless dreadful,my handwriting sometimes needs an interpreter David... Redfern - Arch... - Archaeologist -Ah,I'll show you up.. -Thank you Do you want anything for your coffee, monsieur? Some cognac I'll come soon Your cognac, monsieur. -Thank you! -Good night, Dominic! -Good night ! -Good night, Dominic! -Good night Madame Guillard! -Good night, monsieur! Goodnight! Who is that? An Englishman,just arrived from Tunis. He left his car at the landslide Did he see us? I don't know Ask him over Why don't you bring your drink over here,Monsieur Thanks! I'd like to - Goodnight! - Goodnight! This is Mr Redfern... Mr Rankl -Good evening! -And Max, Anna's brother - How do you do? - Good evening! -Have you already met Anna? -Yes Good -Cognac, Dominic! Bring the bottle -And mine Agno tells us you had a long walk this evening Yes. We had some trouble there too Oh One of our trucks got ditched Bad luck! You didn't happen to see it,by any chance? No, I didn't It's a pity you missed us. We could have given you a lift I skirted the road and went through some cork trees What time was that? I've no idea What's happening? Don't take any notice,it goes on all the time here Especially when it's rains How long does it last? Sometimes two minutes,sometimes two days. We were up there for quite a while,you know Up where? - The landslide. - Oh,were you You must have been on the opposite side to us Well,I really don't know Wasn't the kind of weather for reconnaissance All I was concerned with was getting out of the rain. Forgive us, monsieur. But in this part of the world a truck getting ditched It’s an important event. It's important anywhere - Aha! Two minutes! - Thanks -Chalk it up will you -I have If you want anything else,you'll have to give it to yourself -I'm going to bed. -All right -Good night, monsieur -Good night! Good night, Dominic! I think if you'll excuse me,I'll turn in too Of course I flew in from England last night Didn't get much sleep.It was a bit bumpy What about your car? - I believe.. - Anna is arranged about that Yes! It's a car I hired in Tunis They might be a bit upset if I lost it. -Good night! -I hope you'll be comfortable Oh I'm sure I will - Good night! - Good night He saw us They are worse than flies! Let me introduce myself Douvet, the head of police here in Kabarta. How do you do? My name is Redfern I know. I've been told to expect you - Give you any assistance I can. - Thank you! I am looking for a house called Ben Negro Yes, Monsieur Paul Serafis. It's three kilometers from here. Can I get a conveyor -No,I think I'll walk -I'll show you the way.-Thanks Ignore them. But keep your hands in your pockets. Kabarta seems to be a busy place. Yes, the market days - always the same. The worst days of the week for me 52 market days a year for 20 years! Can you wonder I am all for patience I was about to say,how well you look on it Oh,that's an illusion My nerves, my temper, my digestion,all ruined Well, here, monsieur. Ben Negro is a big Moorish villa beyond that hill there You see the drive gates,on your the left after you passed the cork forest -Splendid -Glad been able to help Don't hesitate to come and see me if there is anything you want. -Thank you! -Good-bye! I thought I told you not to come here unless I sent for you. I had to come.We had trouble last night What sort of trouble? A landslide on the road to Tunis,Sir One of our lorries was ditched Well? Max had to leave it unguarded for a short while to come and fetch me The Englishman passed by I think he saw it Has he mentioned it? He denied it That's what makes me suspicious Not logic Rankl I don't think it applies. However watch him! And in future, please, don't come up here unless I ask you to Good morning! My name is Redfern. I wish to see Mr Paul Serafis,please? Thank you! Thank you! Magnificent,isn't it? It certainly is The pierced tracery is identical with that of the Great Mosque of Isfahan. It is the best example of it's kind in existence Forgive me! I'm talking like a guidebook My name is Serafis. Won't you sit down? Thank you! -You were expecting me? -Yes. The British Consul wrote from Tunis And Douvet - from the village. I am very glad to see you, Mr. Redfern. Your visit, will I hope, put an end to a lot of very tedious correspondence. I hope so -You have an identity papers? -Oh yes of course Thank you! These antiques ?? must have been in my cellar for nearly 7 years. It's a very fine collection I believe. And it contains the Napoleon's theft -Have you looked at them? -Oh no. There are still in their crates, exactly as we found them -Your passport is unique, Mr Redfern -Oh? Your photograph is like you Well... I suppose you are anxious to begin work -Yea I am -I won't keep you any longer For my part I shall be more than happy to hand the things over to you It's been a great responsibility having them here It look a bit of a mess,don't they That's not surprising. They were at sea for several days You did a good job with the salvage It would have been a terrible loss! To you perhaps But unfortunately not for the world at large I'm afraid they all have to be re-packed Does that mean an army of laborers in the place? A few,with your permission, of course. -Nice, isn't it? -A lady hand mirror Looks more Greek than Etruscan. When do you propose to start? Tomorrow,I hope In the meantime I better get back to the village and see about some workmen That won't be difficult ask for an Arab called Aribi. -He usually hangs about the beach -Aribi? -Yes -Thanks, I will Would you care to see the collection before it's re-packed? No thank you!I do not think I will It'll only make me envious. I should want the possess it myself - After you... - Thank you! - What do they say? -They say. That you are a man of great wealth.. and that the value of your treasure is fabulous Tell me that the treasure is not mine... And that I am very poor. In that case, Monsieur, - 100 francs an hour. -Each? -Each! A bargain is only a bargain when it brings joy to both sides It's out of the question - Hello - Hello What's happening? The universal sport of stinging the foreigner Is 100 francs an hour the usual charge for carpenters? Hundred an hour?Thirty! I cannot bring such disappointment to my friends Sixty. Fifty! The honor of the work is more to us than the modesty of the award And what hour do our services begin? 8 am tomorrow morning -Thank you for coming to my rescue -I know Aribi He is a good workman, but watch him. He'd steal the laces out of your shoes and sell them back to you. - Do you like fishing? - Very much! That's Max's boat. Perhaps an evening when you finish your work, you come out with us? I'd like to There is nothing to do in Kabarta. I hope you won't find it boring I like places where there is nothing to do. Oh,there is a boar hunt! Of what? Boar hunt -Boar hunt? - Oh, yes! - That's very exciting - It must be But don't worry about lack of excitement because I'm perfectly happy where things are Good. Curious looking beast,isn't it? They must have have lot of gold in those days to waste it on a lizard It's a salamander,really It is a kind of lizard. The ancients believed that it could go through fire unscathed because they had no fear of flames They were cradled in ignorance What do the words say? Greek. Sort of epigram. "To Zeus from Apoldorus." "Not by ignoring evil,does one overcome it but by going to meet it." The world is more evil than dog fleas We were given eyes... but for our comfort the wisdom of knowing when to shut them Where did you get all these comforting proverbs,Aribi? They are the distilled lessons of my own thoughts. Are they? "Not by ignoring evil, does one overcome it..." "but by going to meet it" You got him! You got him! Don't try rush it!Let him swallow the bait for a minute! Now you're losing him Take the net! - Congratulations! - And what is after all that? -It's a mere. -The biggest I ever saw! -How far out are we? -About a few kilometers -It looks beautiful from here -Yes,from here But it's not particular, it's not a nice town -Not nice? -No.It's dirty and corrupt Don't think that Exiles always talk this way Glamourizing own country from a distance... and see no good in any other Are you exiles? From France. We come from Montélimar. We escapade here with our father when the Germans invaded Very soon if we're lucky,we are going back Max is a great believer in luck. So I see... Oh this? It's Arabic - it's keeps off the evil eye. And have you been lucky? Apart from fishing? Yes. I think so. Good! -You two go on,I'll follow - All right Do you like it? Very much! Where did you get it? It was a birthday present -Many happy returns! -No, no, not today. Three months ago It's taken Max the time to finish it Max! Yes,he did it Very good! Max sometimes gets 4,000 francs for a picture - Does he? - Yes it's true! From a dealer in Tunis Anna... What exactly does Max do? For a living I mean He works in the cork factory And what is his connection with Rankl? Rankl works there too Strange friendship,isn't it? Yes it is. -I hated it -Why? Rankl is bad,he is always causing troubles Do you think he is up to something now? I'm sure of it And I'm worried in case it got at Max You are very fond of Max, aren't you? Yes You see... There's only the two of us -There's no one else. -He's older than you are,isn't he? Four years He's very young, but I'm not What's that? It's an Arab wedding They are taking the bridegroom to the hammam -To the hammam? -Yes! To take his bath What ever for? He must be washed before he goes to the bride This thing about purity Good heaven Afterward they will dress him in clean clothes. And the bride's money going into basket Do you think it's a nice custom? Wonderful! You... You don't want your Cinzano? Yes,of course! Anna! Getting back to Max for a moment What makes you think,Rankl got at him? I don't know. Perhaps I'm wrong,perhaps he hasn't But Max is always with him. He's always away in the evening together He may look so worried and anxious all the time I see... We're talking all about Max All right,we'll talk about something else Tell me about your work.How is it going? Fine and quicker than I expected. "Not by ignoring evil does one overcome it" "but by going to meet it" Not by ignoring it But by going to meet it -Aribi! -Yes, monsieur? I think we pack up early today There's something I want to do in the village Very good, monsieur -You'd better lock up! -Yes, monsieur I'm going to pick up some lobsters pens,do you like to come along? What's that? You'd better come and look So,you did see the truck? Yes, I saw it Why didn't you just say so in the first place? I tried to persuade myself that it was no business of mine You were right! It isn't I'm sorry, Max, but I'm afraid it is Much as I dislike it Gunrunning is a tricky thing to come up against in a foreign country If I were you, I should stay clear People don't like interference Don't try and threaten me, Max! It won't work I'm not! I'm advising you I'm not the only in this you know? I never suppose you were Where is those arms going to? Your guess is as good as mine You don't expect me to believe that,do you? Look! I run arms from point A to point B! What happens to them after that doesn't concern me And what about all the unhappiness and bloodshed that follows I suppose that doesn't concern you either? Is this leading up to an announcement that you are going to the police? Perhaps,I don't know. I haven't made up my mind yet How did you get mixed up in all this,Max? It doesn't seem like you You know this coast, you know the people. You've seen the misery that exists here What do you put guns into their hands? What do you expect to get out of it? Money, of course! Isn't that always the answer? Do you really really care so much about money? There are other things in life, you know. All right If you want to know? I'm doing it for Anna -Anna? -Yes. Come in! I'm sorry,I didn't know you were in I thought you were out in the boat, Max. I brought you clean shirts. Thanks Where shall I put them? On the bed. You look very solemnly too Is there anything wrong? No, Anna... We're just having a talk If Max is one of his bad moods... Don't take any notice He often gets them Don't forget, Max! I want those lobsters for supper I know. Cigarette? No thanks! What did you mean when said that you were doing it for Anna? Nothing! So you can make enough money to take her back to France? Perhaps Max, I'm going to give you a chance to get out -Get out? -Get right away from Kabarta... Before I go to the police. But where can I go? Go to Paris. Go and start a new life. Take up your painting again And starve!? No, thanks! You won't starve! I've got a good a very friend there. He's a dealer He'll help you to get started I'll give you a letter of introduction Yes, it sounds fine,doesn't it? But you are forgetting Rankl, aren't you? If he found out I was going he'll stop at nothing to prevent me Then let him find out Tell him you'll go to Tunis for a few days And across to France from there Go this weekend. If only I could! There's nothing to stop you If I do what shall I tell Anna? The same as you tell Rankl I'll let her know the truth as soon as I hear from you There's no point in upsetting her now Very well! I'll go! Good! Why are you doing this for me? It's because of Anna,isn't it? Yes. Not for the sharks to be respectful of the police Hello Anna! Why aren't you dancing? No time for dancing. Looks pretty this evening,didn't she? Really Get on with the dealing Yes... Cognac... cigarettes... -Thank you! -You're too busy to dance? -No I'd like to -Good! Can't dance the English cause they are stiff Can't let themselves go We have a good orchestra in Cafe Du Amis,don't you think? Very If Max and I get back to France... We'll take Agno with us You want to go back very much,don't you? I can't wait. Who is that? Madame Labree.The postmistress One day she hopes to be Madame Douvet. And the two in the corner who are always playing draughts? Monsieur and Madame Guillard. They were friends with my father. They've been wonderful to us You're very friendly with him,aren't you? Why? Because I like him Because he is a guest here. It helps Anna if I am sociable. I suppose being sociable got you that A new jacket? I'm going into Tunis tomorrow I haven't got a suit to wear Been kind enough to lend me a jacket What's wrong with that? What's the real reason for you going to Tunis? I've already told you. There are some trouble with the lease of the cafe Why all the questions? - I'd like to know... - Max! Since Anna is going to dance,can you help me? All right -Do a few glasses,will you? -All right PERSONALLY IN HANDS Esmond de la Brettoniere, PARIS. "For personal reasons, he does not want to return to Kabarta,so do your best to help him." I hope to see you when I return." I'm going, Max,got a job to do Two cognacs and one pack of cigarettes. What time are you leaving tomorrow? I'm catching the first train from Sukel Mars. I'll drive you there,I'm taking a truck -You don't have to. -That's all right Pick you up at six.Good night! Goodnight! Turn your face to the sun. Smile! Splendid! Probably out of focus usually is Do you mean to tell me you don't know anything at all about Carthage? I only knew that they made good wine here New higher (?) , I'll have to buy a history book Sidi Bou Said is the best of this region most beautiful old village.. -in whole North Africa -Is it? Looks rather like something out of Pantomine(?) doesn't it? What's the wine like here? Even better than Carthage. POST TELEGRAPH No, no! .. No, nothing! Nothing. Not even a postcard. -Does he usually write? -Yes, always. He's been gone four days now There must be some reason - Anna... - Yes? There's something I've been meaning to tell you. It's about Max. Is it something bad? No. Not bad exactly but... Let's get out of this crowd Go somewhere quiet where we can talk I suppose I should have guessed He's been unhappy for a long time I'm sorry, Anna. Now he's gone away and is not coming back You'll follow as soon as it can be arranged But... He should have told me about it We've always been such good friends! He must have known that I would have helped him There was nothing you could do,Anna I asked him not to say anything. -You asked him? -Yes, Anna. Why? Because I wanted to keep you out of it But what have had you to keep me out of it? You are a stranger to us, we hardly know you! I'm not a stranger, Anna. You know I'm not Listen to me,you always said that you hated Max being mixed up with Rankl Now he's out of it.He's gone back to France. I was only trying to help. If anyone was to help Max it was me not you -You had no right to interfere! -But, Anna.. Why don't you get back to all those antiquities of you And mind your own business? Anna! Anna! Good morning! Good morning, Anna! It looks like it's going to be a nice day, Dominic. Yes, monsieur I hope you catch your fish. May I come too? Of course you can! Jump in! Steady! I thought you knew about boats. I want to apologize for behaving so badly as the other day I never seen you behave badly You were only trying to help me And I was stupid and ungrateful I didn't want you to be grateful Will you forgive me? Happy? Very happy, David. Very very happy. What about that swim? I'll see you to the sea It's too cold I'm going in Don't be so lazy Anna! Anna! Anna! I'll give anything in the world To know what to say to comfort you, Anna. But words are so useless I'll be all right I must go to Douvet now Stay here and rest until I come back What will you tell him? Everything Except that you know about it. I think it's better to keep you out of it I'll come back as quick as I can But why didn't you come to me in the first place,monsieur? Quite obvious it was your duty to do so Yes,I realize that now only too well But at the time it didn't seem to be my business -Have you told anyone else? -Not yet. Good! It's a dangerous secret! But for the moment it is wiser to keep it to yourself What do you intend to do? Ring up my colleagues here And then get on to the authorities in Tunis Well if you don't mind I'll stay and hear what they have to say Oh,no really, monsieur, I... I think you should leave things in my hands now I won't waste the time, I assure you! But you will let me know,won't you? As soon as you hear anything -I feel very responsible -Of course, I'll keep you informed And in the mean time. I want you to promise me... to carry on your work, as if nothing had happened. -It'll make my task much easier -All right -Good night, monsieur! -Good night Hello Hello! Give me 59!Yes 59 please Yes... Hello? This is Douvet speaking. Yes,Sir Something serious has happened I must come and see you at once Yes I know! I know! It's too late, yes but... But it's too important to wait Yes, well I'll come straight up Yes... It must have been an embarrassing moment for you,Douvet But I am sure that you acted with the greatest discretion He said he won't do anything until I receive instructions from Tunis. Let's hope he doesn't He's an odd character this Englishman. I was convinced that if he'd known about the gunrunning He had come into the open I was very foolish,Douvet -Very, very foolish -I'm glad that you find it amusing Don't you? Or are you so worried about your illicit little fortune that you lost your sense of humor? You're laughing to cover your mistake, monsieur. I intend to remedy the mistake. He must forget what he knows -and keep quiet about what he thinks -He won't When he finds that's nothing is being done, he'll do something himself He is not like us. He is mortal like us,my dear Douvet His silence must be absolute and permanent Why don't you say outright you mean to kill him? That's exactly what I did say No! I won't have it! I won't have any more of it Please, control yourself, Douvet! I won't be dragged deeper into this When I first got mixed up in this business of yours I knew that it was illegal.. -but I thought it was harmless -And profitable How was I to know that I should be involved in a murder? One thing leads to another, doesn't it? Two murders in one village I shall to lose my job and my pensions I think you underestimate the seriousness of your position If you are involved in murder,it is not only your job and your pension you lose I knew nothing about young Max's to afterward Which makes you an accessory It's important to you as it is to me... that Redfern kept his mouth shut. Now... I want you to get this straight. Redfern must be assured that the matters is in hand He must be satisfied in his mind until his work is finished and the collection ready to go After the crates are safely on their way to Tunis He is going to have an accident I haven't yet decided what -But I'll let you know -I don't want to know. I don't want to know Blasted You have to make all that noise? -No, Monsieur -Well,don't Well monsieur... Lend me your knife. Borrowed knife brings bad luck,monsieur. I'll risk it Come on! Come on Come on Where did you get this? One can get it from any bazaar, monsieur. And where did you get this one? In the village, at the shop of Sidi Ben Ali If Monsieur wishes, I can get you one for less than he would charge -No thanks... -Only for 500 francs, monsieur No thanks! Very well, monsieur... -Aribi! -Yes, monsieur? You forgotten your fish. Hey, Douvet! Good afternoon,I didn't see you You were too busy looking the other way I was just coming to see you.Did you have any news? Nothing yet. I made my report and waiting instructions. It's been two days now,it’s incredible! We must be patient, monsieur. I've been patient for 48 hours, it's a long time,Douvet! It's a question of caution One pulls the strings and act too soon Some of the fish may escape. Better then pulling the strings too late -250 monsieur. -Thank you When was your last contact with Tunis? -This morning. -And you got nothing out of them? Only minor officials,monsieur. Well, I shall have to get through to my consul and see what he can find out Oh, monsieur! That would be...Well. That would be most incorrect Incorrect? Since when? Monsieur... Monsieur! Hello! I want to put a call through to Tunis,please Is there any delay? Cafe des Amis Redfern When will they be in order? Yes, if you will,please.Thank you! What is it, David? Have you heard something? Hello Anna!No,nothing. That's the trouble I've just trying to phone the British consul and get him to help -But the lines are down. -That often happens The Bedouins cut the wires. They make bracelets out of it They won't I'll write to him and get it off the first thing in the morning Are you all right, Anna? Yes,I'm all right I want to ask you something. What, David? After all that's happened... do you still feel the same about us? I couldn't live without you. I'm going to write that letter. I want to send it express,please. Tunis? Sixty-five francs please Tell me, those lines to Tunis in order yet? Not yet, monsieur. How much longer is it likely to be? It's difficult to say, Monsieur. It depends on the damage. He seems quite determined to interfere. It would be unwise to delay things any longer You'd better tell Rankl to be here at 5 o'clock this evening. Yes, monsieur. So the great work is nearly finished - Good morning! - Good morning! Must be a satisfying sensation It is What's that? A water carrier may even been used as a scent bag They tell me that you will be through this evening. About six. We must celebrate the occasion over a whiskey That sounds a good idea Shall we say 6.30 in my room? - Fine! - Right! -I'll keep the inner door open -Thank you Come in, Mr. Redfern. You are very punctual. -Sit down! -Thank you! -Water? -Just a little bit You'll find this a good whiskey. -It really does come from Scotland -Good! - Cigar - No, thank you -Cigarette? -Yes Thank you! Now, what are your plans? Well, I finished The crates go by road to to Tunis tomorrow. I hope to follow in a few days but I got some business to attend to first - In Kabarta? - Yes As a matter of fact several times I've been on the point of coming to talk to you about it In what way can I help you? Well, the immediate problem is the telephone line to Tunis I understand you have a certain amount of influence here and I must speak with the British consul If I were you I'd stop worrying about it I don't quite understand. I've got mixed up into something that I can't push aside It was a great mistake on your part to ever becoming involved. I think we must be talking cross-purposes I don't think so. I know what you're talking about. Do you by any chance recognize this ? Be careful! It's loaded It's of the same type as the one you picked up at the landslide. On the night when you first arrived. Sit down! -I'd rather stand,thank you -Sit down! I must be crazy not to have recognized you a mile off You're a scholar,Mr Redfern. And rather as it is disadvantage in the world of affairs I must tell you that the organization... to which you've taken so much exception is mine That's why there is no telephone to Tunis So far as you are concerned And no post So you stopped my letter? I had it stopped. There is a subtle difference You've been somewhat handicapped from the very beginning You see, this town belongs to me. You are on my territory, amongst people I own Let's come down to earth! We're in French territory and subject to French law The representative for French laws is Monsieur Douvet I own Monsieur Douvet! I've never listened to such bombastic nonsense in all my life -You must be mad -I assure you,I'm not mad But you stumbled across some information which might do irreparable harm to a a cause I very much believe in That cause being Serafis I take it You are selling this junk to both sides, aren't you? It's not junk This is 7-65 automatic Modern, and of its kind.. and exceptionally accurate. I'm not going to use it, of course. I wouldn't be quite so foolish You are going to a boar hunt tomorrow I believe -I am going -Of course you are It's all arranged. You are going by the coast road... after having spent the night here... as my guest. And what else? On the way your car will accidentally take a 200 foot plunge into the sea I wouldn't try anything spectacular if I were you I was prepared for this interview You weren't Good night, Anna! Good night! We'll have another go Quiet in here tonight isn't it? Perhaps it's because the Englishman isn't here? Feeling lonely? I'll be back in a minute. Anna... What's the matter? What is it, Anna? Has Rankl being annoying you? Oh, Agno,where is David? Where is he? He said he'll be back at six. And now it's almost eleven! Don't cry, Anna! There is nothing to cry about! Agno.. There are things going on here you don't know about. Terrible things! And I can't tell you Where is he? Is he still in Ben Negro? Or... I can't bear it another minute Anna... You mustn't be so upset Listen... I'll telephone Ben Negro,shall I? And find out what's happening Yes,of course,naturally she would be worried I should have telephoned earlier. Mr. Redfern is here. We’ve been celebrating the end of his work... and I'm going to persuade him to stay the night Tell mademoiselle Tabour my compliments... and that he'll meet her at the boar hunt farm first thing in the morning Yes... Good night! What did they say? It's all right, Anna! He is there. He may stay the night If he does he'll meet you at the farm first thing in the morning. Now What's been going on that I don't know about? Max is dead. Max!? Yes... David found his body in the sea. It can't be true! It's true, Agno! Rankl killed him! I'm sure he killed him! Time to go! The boar hunt starts early Too bad if you were made for it All right get into the back Wait here! Nobody is quite infallible Not even Serafis. I left a knife down the side of the seat Be quick Make for the farm! Anna is there. Be quick Agno Get back and warn Serafis! Blast Come on! We are hunting for a wild boar. Anna! You are coming with us aren't you? I have to wait for Mr. Redfern. Couldn't you leave a word for him I'd rather wait. Thank you! - You are ready? - Well, let's go! Dominic, come on! -Shall I wait with you? -No, of course not, Dominic. - Sure? - Yes! I'll see you later! Anna! Come with us! Oh, I'm sorry! I'm waiting for someone. Oh,very well Anna! -David! - Anna... We got to link up with friends! -Which way did the Guillards go? -That way We must catch up! Left! We have gone too far! Did you see that? Which... which way did they go? I do not know what's happened But you are not going after them Which way did they go? That's been enough, Rankl! I'm through You're not going after them! Now! Which way? They went there! Look Kind of a connection with the fire station... in Sukel El Mars. Hello! Hello! Hello! Nothing happens Hello! Does nothing work in this blasted country? Is it Sukel Mars? -Hello? -Sukel Mars? -How do you do, Monsieur Serafis? -Hello, Duval! -We haven't met for a long time -No May I introduce you, Monsieur Jeffries... Monsieur Serafis! -How do you do? -How do you do? Mr. Jeffries is the British consul in Tunis Splendid -Sit down! -Thank you! Now. -What can I do for you? -Perhaps you will explain,Duval Very well! There was a young Englishman here supervising the dispatch of that collection... which caused you so much trouble a few years ago. -Do you mean David Redfern? -Yes. You met him in his course of work I take it?-Yes We become good friends. Then I'm afraid you are going to be shocked by our errand He is dead. Dead? Yes. There has been an accident then? By the look of it No accident. There are indications that suggest something rather more serious Forgive me, Duval, but this is most disturbing. It had the same effect on us last night when we heard Last night? His body was washed up yesterday morning on a beach near Bizerte It had been in the water about a week - A week!? - Yes! He was identified by a tailor’s label on the inside pocket of his jacket. His name was on it Obviously, gentlemen, there's been some mistake. I mean I'll tell you something... Last evening, Mr. Redfern was sitting where you are sitting now,Duval with a whiskey in his hand. He spent the night here... and left soon after dawn this morning... to go to the village boar hunt I myself saw him go As a matter of fact I even lent him my guns Where are the crates? Gone to Tunis.That was the arrangement wasn't it? After you! Upstairs This is rather odd behaviour isn't it? What exactly do you think you are doing? Don't come any nearer I do not know who you are, but I'm prepared to shoot my way out! -What's going on here? -Jeffries Your Englishman has gone mad. Are you David Redfern? I am I'm here to investigate the report of your death. Congratulations! By being so early! It is quite obvious that Mr Redfern is ill. If you'll excuse me for a moment, gentlemen... I'll go and telephone for help Stay where you are I think perhaps you'd better stay here... until we get a clearer understanding of the situation Everyone stays here Jeffries, get that gun. You go back to the cafe, Anna. I'll follow you as soon as I can. -But, David, I... -Please do as I say! Everything is all right now I think I should do as Mr Redfern suggests -Very well -Should I take that? I'll keep it, Jeffries, if you do not mind. Very well,keep it then. But be good enough to tell us what this is all about I think Serafis can explain what happened much better than I can And I wouldn't try anything spectacular if I were you This time I'm prepared You look like a man who needs a brandy! You are quite right, Agno! I do! Have it with me Thanks David... Oh, David! Subtitles Nostromo
