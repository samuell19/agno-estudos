[SHUTTER CLICKS] [SHUTTER CLICKS] [KEYS PLAYING FAINTLY] [MULTIPLE KEYS PLAY] Wait. Wait! Wait. [XAN GRUNTS] Now go. XAN: In Africa, they say that when you give someone a name, they become your responsibility. A proper name should capture the most important qualities and point them towards a certain kind of life. [CUB GROWLING] I tried different names for the cub, like Fuzzy, Spots, or Speedy, but nothing stuck. [ANIMAL SNORTS] [SNORTING] [ANIMAL ROARS] [ROOSTER CROWING, HENS CLUCKING] XAN: As he became part of our daily lives, he got to know everything around the farm. And I think he started to feel like it was his place too. [PEEPING] Then Mom thought of "Duma," the Swahili word for cheetah. We all thought it sounded pretty good. So then Duma became our responsibility. [?] How fast does it go? Don't worry about how fast right now. Don't worry about how fast. Just worry about how to start, all right? XAN: Yeah. FATHER: A little petrol, just a little. Press this down. And what is that gear? One down. Yeah, one down, four up. All right? Put your hand on it. Let it go. Let it go. Go ahead. That's it.

[SHOUTING EXCITEDLY] [?] Dad! Dad! XAN: It seemed impossible that anything bad could have happened to my dad. Before he got sick, he never let anything stop him. He was always looking at the bright side. Mom and I took care of the farm while Dad was in hospital. The doctor said he recovered really well and that everything was going to be okay. [DUMA PURRING] [?] Come on, Duma! Let's give it some stick! That's 50 K! XAN: Come on, Duma! Look! There it is! Look at that stride now. Come on, Duma! Come on, boy! Hoo! Hey, we're at 60!

[KNOCKING ON LADDER] XAN: Yeah? Got any room for me? Sure, Dad. FATHER: So... We gotta talk about our friend here. He's almost grown. But Duma's-- Hang on. He's nearly too old to survive out there. Duma's got to live the life he was born to. So we gotta take him back. Now. He doesn't want to go. He doesn't want to be wild. No, you can't decide that for him, Xan. He's a wild animal. Remember? His wildness is something... he knows without even knowing it. It's in his bones. It's in his blood. Like a memory, yeah? Like how I know I belong here, on Grandpa's farm. But there's hardly any cheetahs left. Where else would he go besides our farm? We're here, yeah? And then all the way... up there... We found him here. And just north and west... mountains, yeah? Little valley. The river. Lots of springbok and gazelle. Big-cat heaven. Chase, trip, bite. How hard could it be? Hey? Chase, trip, bite. So you and I will take him up next week. Okay?

No, we're going to the city... to live with Aunt Gwen for a while. I need to get a job. What about Duma? Duma will get a new home as well. A big preserve where he'll have lots of room to run around. Xan, I have to take care of us, and the only way I can do that is if we-- That's not what Dad wanted! [?] Xan! Xan, your father and I talked about this. It's the only thing we can do. It's the only thing that makes sense. I know this is scary. I know it won't be easy. We can do this if we stick together, Xan. [DUMA SQUEALS] [SQUEALS] MOTHER: Thanks for having us, Gwen. No worries. [DUMA SQUEALS] The man from the reserve will be here in a day or two. [DUMA WHIMPERS] Xan, wait. All you have to do today is look around and get the lay of the land. Those kids don't know anything you don't know. [DOOR SHUTS] COACH: You want to be a winner? You gotta have passion. Passion, fire! Gentlemen, our day is made. COACH: So, what have we got here?

[CHUCKLES] Opuno Kjadi Ripkuna. You? Xan. Thanks for the water. [CHIRPS] XAN: A bush baby. How did it get here? RIPKUNA: Same as me. Too many wrong turns. Mashaka. Troublemaker. Do you know there's a big river? It's maybe five days' walk from here. But to get there, we must have food. So which one? So which one what? Which one we eat first? You understand, for us to live... we must eat them. Don't worry. We have a few days before we have to make our decision. [PRINTER WHIRRING] [WIND HOWLING] Explain to me this idea. Get more wood. You know, I don't like your cat looking at me like this. Where did you learn this, boy? Where did you learn these ideas? My dad taught me. Your dad? Wait for me, man. Show me the plan, what you are going to make, man. [WIND GUSTING] Put it up! Put it up. I am. Holy smoker! XAN: Come on, hang on. Quickly. [?] XAN: Let her go. RIPKUNA: We are doing it, Xan.

Your cheetah is a great hunter, yeah. I'm very impressed. He caught an egg. You know, your cheetah... he will not live long out here. For what he would be worth, you know you could build a house. You could build a lot of houses. Maybe even buy a nice car. With DVD. [TWIGS CLATTER] You don't sell a friend. You know, the rich, they buy animal like him every day. Pay big money, make business. You know? Zoo, fun park. And then they make more money. Where are you going, boy? Do you know where you are going? [CHEEPS] My dad and I found him over here. So you plan to cross the Okavango. Yeah, so? "Yeah, so?" That is a place of many teeth, my friend. It is a place to die. I'm not afraid. Be smart. Be afraid. "I am not afraid." Stupid boy. Don't know nothing. Don't know nothing. [CREATURE MOANS] You know, you could end up in a lion's belly. Fire. Fire is the only thing that scares them. Ah... You know, I know that place. I could take you a little way that way. But then I have to go back south, eh? You would like that? Okay. I won't take you all the whole way. Just some of the way. [?] Come on, boy. XAN: Who are they? RIPKUNA: People. People who never dreamed that they would die here. This place is full of angry spirits, eh? [MUTTERS] There's a story in this. I'm not sure I want to know it, eh?

[HELICOPTER APPROACHING] We need to go farther. There's nothing here but sand. I can't see anything. Come here. Get down. [GRUNTS] [?] Do you know... how he got those black lines on his face? They say it's to stop the glare from the sun during the day while they hunt. There was a mother cheetah. She loved her cub very much, and one day... he got lost. And she searched, and she searched, and she called, and she called. And she cried so long and so hard that her tears made black streaks... down her face. [PURRS] Her face... was stained forever... from her crying. [ANIMAL SQUAWKS] [METAL SCRAPING] An honorable weapon... if there is such a thing. For a real warrior, you know. For you to face your enemies and show your courage. Eye to eye. A lot of diamonds came out of here. I know they did not get them all. Always, I look. One day, I'll get lucky. Make rich. You. Stay.

This little stuff... no big stuff. Dig, boy. Dig. [GRUNTING] Why you are stopping? Where have you been taking us? I'm taking you where you want to go. No, you're not. You're taking us north, not west. I am taking you the way to the mountains. It's the way to town, to the police, and-- What are you talking about? Collecting a reward for me and selling Duma. How do you get such ideas? I am taking you north to go west. If you go straight west, it is a way to-- You're just trying to scare me. You want me to go your way so you can turn us in. Xan-- You go your way, and I'll go mine. Xan, where you are going? Xan. Come back. You can't leave me like this, Xan. Xan. Come back, Xan! Xan. Xan! Xan, come back! I don't want him to follow us.

You were in a hog's house. That is better than being in a lion's belly, no? I'm sorry for what I did. It was a mistake. But you were right, eh? I was thinking about how much money I could get for you both. I had big plans, Xan. I left my village, my wife, my children to be a big man. Went to the big city to make big money. But I did not find work, eh? And soon, I was a small man that did small things. I ended up in the biggest jail you ever see. That is a place I never want to go to again. Do you understand? My mother probably hates me. Because I left her. Mothers never stop loving their children. What do you know about mothers? I am a father. [?] [WHISPERS] This is dinner. This way, this way. Quickly, come. He's got him. [?] RIPKUNA: We are not going to eat tonight. [PEOPLE SINGING IN DISTANCE] Now, that food... that will be an easy catch. XAN: Maybe. You have any ideas? Yeah.

WOMAN: No, I'm talking about the-- WOMAN 2: That's a water bird, darling. Well, I don't see anything there at all. Are your contacts in? They're in. Help me! It bit me. [XAN GROANING] It bit me! What bit you? What bit you? This. [SCREAMING] It's a black mamba! [SHOUTING & SCREAMING] That's right, lad. Ah! Eat. Mm! You will go far, Xan. As long as you stay out of jail, eh? I want you to have this. What is that? It's for helping me. No. I can't. I want you to have it. I don't want it. You don't understand, Xan. People die for that stuff, eh? I can't take it. Okay. Then the water has it. Five... four, three... two, one-- Okay, okay, okay. I am sure I'm going to help you at least one more time, eh? I will safe-keep it. Come. Look. You see this? [RATTLING] These pretty little stones... I found when I had to dig myself out. Do you remember? It's okay. Take them. I want you to remember your friend Ripkuna. I'll remember you, Rip. But I hope you remember me. Because now I'm gonna say goodbye. [CRACKING] Xan? Xan. What you are do--? Wake up, Xan. [LAUGHING] Xan! Don't do that. That was not funny. I'll kill you myself next time. Stupid boy. Get on. You wish. [?] [XAN WHISTLES PEEPING SOUND] What is that noise you are making? When two cheetahs are lost, and they're looking for each other, they make that sound.

[?] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [TWIGS SNAPPING] RIPKUNA: My grandfather would bring me to this place when I was younger than you. RIPKUNA: The old ones, they talk to me. See how they lived, feared... who they loved. Their world is gone. But we are not so different. You know, nobody comes here anymore. They are all forgotten. I myself am no better. My own father, I do not know whether he lives or not. My father... he died recently. How can someone just disappear like that... forever? Yebo. I too would be angry. You know, Xan... people go when they are ready to go. Not when you are. We are all just... travelers on the same river. Grandparents, parents, their sons and daughters. We all have our time on the river. We just... We do what we can before we disappear. This is your time, Xan... Duma's... and mine. Very soon we will be where Duma is going. After... I am going to go and see my family, see if they welcome me or not. And you can go and see your mother. Your father is dead for her too. Everything's changed. It's not the same. It's different. That's it, Xan. Change, yeah. That's what happens. All the time. The little boy that left home is not the little boy that is with me now, eh? See? Change. [?] Xan, can you see? Above that cliff, in the canyon? Yeah. A village...my village. Xan, stop. XAN: What is it? Tsetse. Do what I say, yeah? You have to run. [FLIES BUZZING] Hey. Wait. Wait. Wait! Now, breathe!

I'm gonna miss you. [?] [PEEPING, SQUEALING] [?] XAN: There are things you know without knowing. For Duma, it was his wildness. For Rip, his family. For me, it was my dad. Everything he was, everything he believed in, is now part of me. I was taking Duma home, but he took me somewhere too. Finding Duma's true home brought me back to mine, and showed me that love doesn't stop when time passes or you live in different places, or somebody's gone. And that's how it was with me and Duma.
