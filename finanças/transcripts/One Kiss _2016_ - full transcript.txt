Dear Blu, how are you? Today's forecast calls for a shitty day, just like every other day. Nothing more, nothing less. Calm shit, steady shit, incessant shit, spread evenly throughout the 24 hours of the day. Nothing new. When you were 16, every day seemed just like the others. Meaning just as horrible as all the others. Reading this no that may seem impossible, but that's how it was You could do anything: good or bad things, listen to music or wander around, write or sit in detention all day in a fucking library. In the end, it was all the same. I'm here to remind you of that. On March 23rd at 4:37 when you were 16, my dearest Blu, you felt that life really sucked. So whatever you might be doing now, smile. It can't be worse than it was then. Yours, Blu. Bye. BLU SUCKS OFF THE WHOLE SCHOOL ONE KISS Here we are. It probably looked bigger in the photos. No, it looked just like this. Your room's this way. We would've hung something up but figured you'd want to do it. Thanks. Is the computer for me? Yes, it was my cousin's, I've set it up for you. Like it? A lot. The closet's a bit small... I have zillions of clothes and shoes. Zillions of shoes. And hats. - I'm just preparing you. - We are prepared. - Can I say something else? - Sure. There's no full-length mirror. Tragic! - I'll get you one. - Consider it done. - I'll unpack my things. - Okay, we'll leave you to it. WELCOME LORENZO! R.S. - Shit! - Hey... It ran away, no big deal. I shot too soon. Next time, come on. Sure you don't want me to come in? Unless you want to sabotage my social life in a flash... I can handle anything but "mommy's boy". Okay. BLU SLUT It's not like Turin, is it? It doesn't matter. I was born to survive, I was born to be brave. I was born to survive, born to be brave. Lady Gaga. - Guess you need an intensive course. - Very intensive. Or I won't understand a word you say. See you at home later. Bye, Ste. Faggot! Welcome to school, Lorenzo. Here we go... Next time you're late I won't let you in, understood? - Sorry I'm late. - Sit down, Pavan. Carry on, Lorenzo. After Turin I returned to the foster home to continue my studies. And yesterday I arrived in this delightful city. End of story. Great, for now you can sit in on our discussion about Dante's Inferno, and after class you and I can go over the syllabus. Go sit next to Mantoni. I bet you two will hit it off. - Nice shirt. - Wanna borrow it? It's better than your sweater, that yellow looks like puke. He's a total faggot. Hi. I'm Lorenzo. Je m'appelle Lorenzo. My name is - Yeah, I heard. Mantoni, it says you're meant to go back to the library. Why? Talk to the principal. And now for Dante. Take out your books, page 238-239. You work in the library? Only when I'm in detention for having told off Messina, she tried to stop me from beating the bitches. Messina's the English teacher. and those are the bitches. Caterina, Irene, and Claudia. Let's start reading: "Florence, exult, for thou so mightily..." - Anyway, I'm Blu. - Blu? Like the color? More like "my parents were super wasted when I was born". Mine were too, I think. But at least I got a normal name. - That's the only normal thing you got! - Yeah, luckily. "...shalt feel what Prato would fain might come upon thee". Lorenzo, I'm Roberto Santoro, I was expecting you. Hello. No cell phones in here. What sports do you play? Me? None. They usually just deflate them, they're too spineless to slash them. - Why? - Dunno. Is the writing on the walls about you true? - You mean that I'm a slut? - Yes. No. I'm with a popular guy so they hate me. Are you gay or is this just the perfect cover? Well, I like boys, so it's very likely that I am gay. - I've never met a gay guy. - Or so you think. We're 1 in 15, statistically speaking. The pump's at the end of the block. Push, or are you a weakling gay? I'm a smart gay, I won't push alone, we'll do it together. Hustle, come on! Three more, three more! Go, Antonio! Come on. Block it! Want to go get a beer? We'll be done by 9:00. Me, Giacomo, you, Gianluca, and Paolo. The five of us in one car. Shower fast or I won't wait. - Did you want to come? - I have to study. Since when do you study? Don't you know it's useless? Thanks, but I've got stuff to do. Hi, slut. Hi, faggot. I still haven't finished my half. A slut and also a slow one. I'm calling, don't get too excited. So wait, are you saying you're good at Latin as well? Don't you get it? I'm good in all subjects. People panic when they find out. Not me, I don't mind if you do all the work. - What were your grades like? - In Turin straight A's. Practically a genius. My parents would be proud if they weren't 6 feet under. You're upset. No, I'm not. You are. You're upset they didn't take you along. No, I don't give a shit. Simone's a loser. Well, yes... that's true. - But you're still upset. - Yes, a bit... not much. They treat me... like I'm dumb. Who gives a shit. Antonio, fuck them. You're the best basketball player, they need you. Without you, they're worthless, remember that. - I do remember that. - Good. Go to sleep and forget about it. Roby, this is the wrong size. The piece needs to be Excuse me. Hello? Yes, speaking. What? Who is this? - You sissy! - Faggot. - News? - None. - I heard Renato raise his voice. - That's a good sign. Mr. Petris, let's not turn this into something it's not. Lorenzo wasn't kicked out of class for wearing nail polish. Really? How odd... Isn't that what his teacher just said? You wanted to suspend him because of his colored nails. I said that the boy's nail polish caused a disruption in class. His classmates started cackling... Then you should suspend the others, not him. And don't call him "the boy", his name's Lorenzo. The others were justly shocked by Lorenzo. If I walk in wearing a Hawaiian shirt and flower crown and the class roars, the class isn't to blame. My son wasn't wearing a flower crown. Knowing him, it's not unlikely! We can expect anything from him. Anna, please. Listen, if you're not capable of controlling your class, it's not our problem... it's your problem. If you suspend Lorenzo for wearing nail polish, it'll be in every paper tomorrow. You had no right to kick him out of class. You should encourage the boy to behave appropriately. I told you his name is Lorenzo. Call him Lorenzo, got it? Lorenzo. Know what? Tonight I'll talk to him, and tomorrow he'll wear lipstick. And then we'll see what you'll do... - Renato, calm down. - I am calm. Bitch. - What did you say? - I said bitch. Did you automatically assume I was referring to you? Listen, Mr. Petris, let's put an end to this. Ms. Messina, the fact that Lorenzo wore nail polish cannot be considered a disruption. Your son can come to school tomorrow. Fine, but if he continues with this provocative behavior, I can't be responsible for the class' reaction. Oh yes, you can. You should teach them respect for others. And tolerance, which must be reciprocal. Tolerance is a word I don't like. My son shouldn't be tolerated, he should be accepted for who he is. Are we done now? Don't make a big deal of it. Nobody listens to Ms. Messina... But she's still Lorenzo's teacher. What a pain in the ass! - How's Miriam? - Great, she's at five months now. - Send her my love. - Sure. - I'm off. - Bye. - Thanks for the support. - Sure. You can wear nail polish any time you want. If your teachers say anything, just call me. Okay? Stefania? Everything's fine. We're on our way. - You kept the ringtone? - It's very modern. Very... Thanks, I'm the only one who has it at the factory. - Can I ask you something? - Anything. - Why'd you and Stefania choose me? - Huh? You know, there were younger kids at the foster home. Younger and easier. Miss Rosato said that at age 16... Yes, she told us too, everyone wants the younger kids. She also told us what happened with the other parents. Then she showed us a photo of you dancing at the foster home. - What was I wearing? - A yellow jumpsuit. It was a year ago, I was playing a guy on "Glee". I don't know what you were doing... But I liked it. Lorenzo, I'm not afraid. You don't need to test me. Same here. There you go. - Hi. - Hi, Stefania. - Everything okay? - Everything's well. Right? Let me see those hands... Black makes your nails look dirty, use another color. Pink's too predictable, they'd expect it. Silly billy! Dear Mrs. Cowoni, we're sorry to inform you your novel is not a good fit for our publishing house. Kind regards. - Morning. - Morning, how's it going? Fine. I think I had too much coffee this morning. And too many cigarettes, you stink. - Is cheese lasagna okay with you? - Yes. - Is Luca back? - Not yet. I was on a roll this morning, I wrote two whole pages. Good ones, I think. I even reread them. - How's school? - Fine. There's a new kid, Lorenzo. Hold on, let me go check the mail first. Fingers crossed! My dear Blu, maybe when you're older you'll think about when your parents took care of you, protected you, shielded you from disappointments and life's harshness. Well, then you're not remembering how things were. They didn't protected you. They loved you, of course, but didn't protect you. It's not their fault, they just couldn't manage with you or your shitty little brother. Am I complaining? No, I'm not. I'm sure all of this came in handy. Didn't it? You knew better than to expect anything during high school. I'm sure you then took what you wanted from life. Right, Blu? Didn't you take everything plus interest 25 years later? I'll make you coffee, then you can hit the books. - Hi, dad. - Hello. - Want some chicken? - No, I ate at the canteen. I'm going to bed, I have another night shift. I bought flowers, I'd like to go before it gets dark. Wake me up. I'll go alone then, I don't want to ask Antonio. Just wake me up. FAGGOT I HATE LORENZO YOU LITTLE SHITS, ONE DAY YOU'LL ALL WORK FOR ME. Lorenzo! Lorenzo, come outside. Lorenzo! SORRY What do you want now? You're not upset, are you? We don't hate you at all, we adore you! You've lit up our school. I knew right away. That's why I smiled at you. Before I came you were a colossal drag, provincial, asleep, the walking dead, didn't you know? - Yes. - Please don't be mad. You're just too fabulous for us. Yes, I am fabulous. You noticed? I'm impressed, ma'am. - How do you do it? - Dunno, it comes naturally. What are the sporty guys doing here? - Why isn't Antonio here? - He couldn't come. He wants to talk to you alone. - You like Antonio? - Be honest, do you like him? Come on, tell us! Enough. I can't spend my night talking to you, see you at school. I'll blow you off for a while, don't get upset. But I have standards to maintain. Nighty night. No, wait! BLU SLUT Shitheads. Everyone's in on it. Look what Claudia wrote. See? This is what I call frugal communication: With a single post this bitch insults me and also invites everyone to her birthday party. Are you going? Like hell! Plus, she didn't invite me. Too easy. What if she invited you? If she knelt down and begged you to go? No. Why do they hate you, because of Giò? Not just that. Last year. I screwed the four coolest guys in school, they were seniors. At the same time, at Giò's place. - No way. - Yes way! Those jerks spilled the beans so now everyone hates me. Giacomo offered me 50 euros for a hand job last month. And? I told him to get his mom to do it, she'd give him the works. They called me "flamer". - How do you cope? - I don't give a shit. I'll be out of here in 2 years anyway. And you? Like this. See this? All of them killed themselves. Jumping out of windows, hanging themselves, slitting their wrists, poisoning themselves, shooting themselves. I won't end up like them. I have a bunch of good reasons to live. - Like? - Like life. Like Antonio. You like him and I, like, noticed. No... yes. But he's odd. Did you notice he never says a word? They say he's dumb. - Why? - Dunno, everyone calls him "retard". Ever notice anything "everyone" says usually tends to be bullshit? What's in there? CDs, my parents, old clothes. You mean those are vintage clothes waiting to be freed? No, I mean those are old clothes. Don't get excited. We'll see, let's open it! Look here! They put music on so we can't hear what they're doing. - I knew they were having sex. - Shut up, get lost. Ready! Ready! Go! No, I don't dance. Are you also a loser who wasn't invited to Claudia's party? Then come to Via Paolo Sarpi 5 on Friday at 8:00 PM. Dress code: very fancy! Do I look like a douchebag? I look like a douchebag. What are you doing? What the hell are you wearing? I'm fancy, like the invite said. Come in or I'll catch my death. Come on! - What's this? - Don't just stand there, sit down. - Where'd you get those clothes? - My parents' old stuff. Mr. Mantoni wore that when he was young? - Aren't we fabulous? - You look like two nutcases. Drink, if they catch us with booze we'll get thrown out. See? We booked the whole pizzeria. Just like they did in a film. - But I only have 20 euros. - Lorenzo's lying. Nobody ever comes here. Let's make a toast: to the biggest losers of Newton high school or the entire city. Are you nuts? In one gulp? With those clothes on you can't call anyone nuts. - Touché. - Huh? - "Touched". - By who? What kind of pizza do you want? This Egyptian guy makes authentic Neapolitan pizza. - What? - Well? - Margherita pizza. - Capricciosa for me. No, sorry, wait, I'd like... Dear Blu, April brings a little surprise: things change. Nothing epic though, life is still a drag, nobody speaks to you at school and the teachers are still the same old assholes. - Jenny for me. - Jenny? - Two Texans. - I'll give you a minute. but at times you forget it because you're drunk or happy or do something new. Scared you? There are days when you're less afraid, days that go by faster than others. Guys, I have a great idea: let's call the cops and say there's a bomb at Claudia's party. Are you serious? - No way. - Why? A bomb's unlikely. How about a gas leak? Deal! Who do we call for that? The fire department? - I'm going home. - No, stay with us. Days when you're even kind of happy to be alive. Losers to the 3rd degree. Don't look at them. Perhaps these are the days you'll remember when you're older. Days like these, which can be one in a million... Pavan, you nearly got a passing grade on your Petrarch essay. It was actually written well. - Bravo. - Thanks. Mantoni, can I read yours to the class just this once? - Please? - No way. - Just this... - We have an agreement. Teach. Until you're my student, once you graduate, I'll paste your essays on all the walls. What the hell did you write? Will you let me read it? Forget it. You're too gay. Because of days like these, you later regret the passing of time. What's this? No! Where'd you find them? You were horrid with those glasses. Horrid? These are Mods, glasses. What the heck are Mods? Mods are proud, elegant, and always one step ahead. - What's with you? - Where'd you find them? Days like these stand out. If life were full of days like these it would be unbearably beautiful. You'll never convince me... Come on, Why not teach us how to play? Because you'd suck, you have no coordination. - I'm officially offended. - No coordination? At age 13 I posted a video on Facebook With me dancing to Justin Bieber. I got 300 likes! And 3,000 people insulting you! So what? That's why I deleted it. I am super coordinated! Give me that ball right now! - Now you hang out with those losers? - Just play. I bet he won't do it. - I bet he will. - I bet he won't. - You don't know him. - Nor do you. No. But I get him. He'll do it, you'll see. Pavan, remember the sequence: first lather up, then rinse off, never the opposite. Fuck off. Rule one: don't aim the light at Lorenzo, aim it at the background, frame it correctly. Did Blu show you any of my videos? A few... The one of mom sleeping for 360 minutes, the aquarium with the dead fish buoyed by bubbles, but I spared him the time-lapse of the banana rotting. Those are old projects. You know, Yoko Ono won over John Lennon with a rotten apple. Never mind. Why go to all this trouble anyway? We have to do a fake news show for class. Is it him? Oh God, he did it. It's tiny! What are you talking about? - Should we set the table? - I'm almost done. Just a hundred more sequins to sew on. Why not make the jacket a bit more ordinary? Not because I want to curb your freedom of expression, I swear, I'm just starving... WE'RE FILMING TOMORROW They're nuts. - Dunno. - Too late. You're in. Good night you two, have sweet dreams of us. We don't even know if that's true. It's true, you can smell it from a mile away. But it's her business, she's not harming anyone. You like Irene? Want to do her? No, I don't like Irene! Then the script is final. Scared? No. But I think they'll get us back for this. How? Insulting us and laughing behind our backs? - I'm used to it. - You shouldn't be. If they say things that aren't true you should... True or not, who gives a shit? If you want to pull out just say so. I never said that! - This stuff makes you aggressive. - No way. It's my mom's weed, When she smokes it she chills out. What is it? It's hard to look at you, you're so beautiful. Oh please! So? You look fabulous. I've never seen an anchorman with a ring though. It was my mom's, my real mom, not Stefania. I always imagined I'd wear it for my showbiz debut. How about if I wrap things up with a Gaga song? Applause. No! Am I sweaty, shiny? Do I need more foundation or powder? I know you'd like some but you don't need more make-up. Breaking news: he cracked a joke! Rehearse it, We have to check the audio. - Forget it, let's go. - Good luck! Hello and welcome to the first episode of the web series: "Newton's Dirty Laundry". For today's Greatest Mysteries Revealed we'll be talking about: Caterina, Irene, and Claudia. Perhaps not everyone knows that last year, Giò Accardi threw Caterina out of his car when, in a drunken stupor, she tried to give him a blow job. And the splendid Irene Cadorin has a perspiration issue that can't be tamed by heavy-duty deodorants. Whereas the designer bags Claudia wears to school are bought from street vendors by her mom who even haggles. For our Leopardian segment, "Stepmother Nature", we have an exclusive scoop. Giacomo Dorsi, the basketball team's popular second playmaker has the most minuscule penis ever to be found on a human. See? What, you can't see it? Our point exactly. That's all for now, We thank the "I hate Lorenzo" group. Remember, don't criticize others, we can all be criticized, no one is normal, and we invite you to mind your own business. Until the next episode. Roll credits! Tell us what's so funny. Nothing, I swear. Mr. Petris, I suspect I'm going to be literally kicked off the basketball team. That's sad. Very sad. Why? Did you miss an important game? No, he revealed compromising details about his teammates. - Such as? - The size of Giacomo's cock. No details. Kids, are you drunk? No. We're open-minded and all, but this isn't acceptable at your age. Come on! I get it... I'll drive you two home, Lorenzo go to your room. We smoked some joints when we were kids too, but we didn't rub it in our parents, faces. Move it, march! Get going! Sorry, Mr. Petris. We'll get our coats. - Was it unwarranted or necessary? - Necessary. - We have to set boundaries. - Yes. Shall I bring him some herbal tea and find out what happened? When you smoked joints, did your mom bring you herbal tea? - No. - Well... Why are you still awake? - Were you waiting up? - No. Well... you didn't answer your phone so I couldn't sleep. I was listening to music. My battery died, I don't want you to worry about me. I'm fine. I know, I can tell. But you seem odd... I'm fine, I swear. You'll need to teach me to use it, you say it has 1,000 songs but I only hear one. I'll teach you, but go to sleep now, it's late. Yes, it's late for you too. Will you turn this thingy off? I'm sorry. For what? They're on your back because of what happened to me. - They worry. - It's fine, it's not a problem. Mom was listening to your music. It'll knock her socks off... There's some hardcore stuff on there. Massimo? I think mom and dad would've preferred me to die that night instead of you. - They'd rather have you still. - That's bullshit! You are so stoned... Think about good things, think about Blu instead. Go to bed. I miss you. I miss you lots. Antonio! Antonio! Antonio! Antonio! Shut up! You can't sing, your voice sucks. Enough. Shut it off. Stefania's a sewing wizard, it fits you perfectly! Problem: they've all seen the video. Good, that's why we put it on YouTube. But they're pissed off. Now what? We'll deal with the consequences, that's the point. We could let them cool off and not go in today. - Not go in? - Yes. - We can go to the woods. - The woods? The woods? Sorry, but I cannot accept this display of provincialism. What? Got daddy's credit card? Why? Because we're leaving. You know, I feel funny that we're dressed the same. I like it, we look united, like a pop rock band. I used to live in Trastevere, let's go there. Sure. May as well go see the foster home I grew up in then... Is this a tour of our past? How sad, how depressing! And what does the fabulous fellow suggest then? Moron! Let me guess... We didn't find anything we like. But I'll take this. That's 2.99 euros. Pay at the register. - Who gave them my picture? You! - Who knows, could be anyone. - You did it, dickhead. - Don't touch me! Who'd touch you? You sicken me. Him and that slut suck you off? I'll hurt you, Giacomo. Leave me alone. Fuck you. 10-8. One more for the win. Go, go, use the backboard! 12! white jerseys to the backcourt. Suicide drills! Where are you going? Nice team spirit... What's wrong? What did Giacomo say to you? He didn't say anything but he's pissed off. I think we went overboard. I'll give you the English homework before Ms. Messina shows up. What's that? Rejection letters from publishers to my mom, I spare her. I'll give it right back. it's an interesting portrait of family life." Blu, what's up? Morning. Bortoluzzi, are you at least able to close the door? - Hurry up. - All right... We'll start by correcting the homework I assigned you. Mantoni, take a seat and ditch the phone. Thanks. - Sit or she'll flip out. - Mantoni, the phone! Mantoni. Hey! - What's up? - Dunno. I'll have you suspended. "My daughter has new friends: one is gay, the other is not. They spend lots of time together. Too much? I'm not sure if I like them. She's smiling more but still has that sad, forlorn aura which seems like a prerequisite for 16-year-olds these days. " "Was I like that too? So laid back and chilled out? At times, on the sofa, she looks like a child. I look at her and think of me at that age. " Stop! You're not allowed to leave! "She says she loves her boyfriend and kisses his photo on her wall. The daughter's romantic. Who knew? She seems so bold, but then her legs quiver. What strikes me most is her apathy, the constant lack of any prospects for the future. What'll they do as grown-ups? Was I not able to pass anything on to her? None of my dreams? She doesn't dream, she just glides. Is it possible to look at a daughter and consider her both your pride and your failure?" Hi, why are you here? Blu! What the hell? "The daughter's romantic, depressed, one friend is gay, the other isn't." How dare you talk about my life?! I'm not talking about your life, I'm talking about mine. And nowhere does it say... You posted my business online without even telling me! - Unbelievable. - I do it for me. I need to write about my life or I'll go insane. - I need to do it. - Look at you... Shame on you, using my life to play writer! - That's not how it is. - Sure... Does dad know what you say about him? "The husband's become what he never wanted to be." And Luca? "The son's not so bright." - Did you tell him? - Nobody knows, just me and you. Blu, you've always understood me. You're an avid reader, you write amazing essays. Don't touch me! I hate you! You can't sleep outside. I'll go home once they're asleep or I'll just sleep here. I'm cold already. Do you ever imagine you're somewhere else? Always. But then I always Wake up in this shithole. Not dreaming of being somewhere else, I mean imagining that things happen differently. I do it all the time, that's why I'm so fabulous. Sure... When I don't want to see something, I don't. I go somewhere else with my mind. - Like how? - Like... ...everyone loves me. - Yeah, whatever. Too much wine. - Or not enough. Is there more? - It's my mom, gotta go. See you. Blu, go home, all right? Yes. - See you. - Bye. - Hug me, I'm cold. - Not on your life! He's such a mommy's boy. No, they keep him close out of fear. Did you know his brother? I saw him around, he was a sharp guy, always surrounded by friends. Just like Antonio... - Were they close? - Don't know. His name was Massimo. The whole city went to his funeral. He never talks about it, so I bet they were really close. New tragedy alert: he likes you. - Who? - Antonio. He likes you. Didn't you notice how he looks at you? You're afraid to make a move, cause you're afraid he'll say no so you're pretending that he likes me. I'm not afraid of anything. Well, I think he likes you. He laughs at all your jokes. That's because I've got an amazing sense of humor. You really think he likes me? God, you're such a girl. Ouch! I like Blu. But Lorenzo... Lorenzo what? - I don't like him. - He's my friend. We're friends, like I said. Listen, leave me alone. Let me sleep. WE'RE COOL AND YOU SUCK! WE HATE YOU ALL! L.B.A. Mediocre. If we'd really done it, it would've been much more original. Wow, that's some mess you made! Don't bother with them, wait till the teachers see what they did. Let her go! Have you lost your minds? Stop it! Let me go! Kids, enough! Antonio, let her go! What have you done? Blu, what's going on? "Dear sir, as a result of disciplinary interventions, your son Antonio has been suspended from school for 3 days. " I won't do it. Why do they believe them and not us? Because it looks like we did it, not them. Plus, you almost sent Caterina to the ER. - Let's just get it over with. - I won't do it. - Lorenzo, will you help at least? - Yes, let's do it. But now you need to start understanding. What? That life's unbearable like this. - We've known that for a while. - Yeah. Take this can and start changing our life with that wall. All right. How much longer? We're almost done. Doesn't it look good? We painted the other walls too. All white. - Doesn't it look good? - Yes, hurry up. Dear Blu, I can confirm life as a teenager always sucks. Especially after all my business, mine and yours, ended up online thanks to that great writer, our mother. But friendship is something awesome, don't forget it. And if you have no friends at 40... Well, get busy because friends will save you. Only them. I don't like this development. What development? It's a suspension. I'll be back at school in two days. A suspension is a suspension. - What if they fail you again? - No, they won't. Yeah... easier said than done. I can't handle your mom anymore, she keeps pestering me. She says you're always out and about and that you've changed. She's worried. - Are you worried? - No. I see you smiling, you haven't done that in ages. But I don't want you to flunk. - Can't you study with your friends? - I can. - I mean, I can try. - Good... try. Can you do two things at once? I'm not like Massimo. Why bring him up? Massimo was good at everything, even hunting. I never catch anything, you know it. Who put that bullshit in your head? - No one, I'm the one who thinks it. - You think wrong. You think wrong. What's wrong, are we smothering you? Try to understand mom, she's scared. But don't let her stop you. Understand me? Why does everyone ask if I understand? I understand, I'm not stupid! It's just a figure of speech. What's with you? You always say that if we talk we won't catch anything... So let's be quiet. Let's be quiet just for a bit. Blu, where are you going? You don't have school today. I'm talking to you. Stop! I made a mistake, I'm sorry. I deleted everything online, you can check if you want. Enough. How much longer will you hold a grudge? Why don't you stop her? She always gets her way, even after being suspended... Be quiet and get your backpack, the bus will be here soon. One day I'll report you all! Bye, I'm off. - You're not eating? - I'm not hungry, thanks. Where are you going? Out with Blu and Antonio, We're all suspended. - Be careful, Lorenzo. - Of what? Everything. You're good at school, you chew them all up... classmates, teachers... and they can't stand this. Take it down a notch. I'll be more careful, promise. I'll chew less. - Bye. - Bye... Kiss first. We have to encourage him, like they said at the foster home... We need to be on his side. Who knows, maybe we're doing the wrong thing or should change our approach. They give us a ton of guidelines, but when you see him happy and smiling... it all goes up in smoke. Should we get changed? I'll go over there. Are you ready? - Hi. - Hi. - What's up? - I'm putting them away. We didn't ruin them, We just wore them a few times. I'm glad you used them, but they'll get ruined if you leave them out. - But why are you home? - Today it's just me and you. Mom and Luca are at grandma's for a bit. Hey. She did it to give you some breathing space. - To help you. - She could've stayed. It makes no difference. You're still a kid, things are more complicated for adults. Maybe mom thinks I'm a failure. Maybe you do too. I don't, dad. Well I do, I kind of think so. At least Nina can keep writing, and this is enough to make me happy. You shouldn't judge her, I don't. You finish up here. You're overreacting. You're not answering my texts, four texts! - You don't say hi when I walk by. - Stop it! What did I do that was so wrong? - I like you, so what? - Shut up. And piss off. - You broke up with the losers? - Leave Antonio alone. Hi. Look what I got for you at the flea market. Like it? - Try it on. - Not now. I think it's perfect for you. We could get two more like it for your friends. What's wrong? I've fallen in love with Antonio but he doesn't like me. Sorry Stefania, can I be alone? - Get out of the way. - Enough, damn it. Why won't you hang out with us anymore? - I don't feel like talking about it. - I do. - Things were going so well. - So well for you two. You two were a single entity, from the very start. That's not true. You were in cahoots at the river. I'm not that stupid. Fine, I knew Lorenzo liked you, so what? That doesn't change a thing. You think you're so smart but you don't get it. Do you need me to spell it out? I'm in love with you, Blu. But I can't... I'm with Giò, you know that. He made you fuck three guys, great boyfriend! He didn't make me do it, I wanted to. And what do you know? I'd keep you all to myself. He's a piece of shit. Just get out of the way, let me go. May I? Yes. Are you feeling better? Yes. - I bought chicken for dinner. - Chicken curry? Mhmm. My favorite. Mhmm. When I was your age, I was crazy about a boy from here. His name was Giulio. But don't tell Renato, he doesn't need to know. He was handsome... and I stopped eating. I was as thin as a stick. He had a girlfriend, she was older and worked in a factory. She was gorgeous. He never even looked at me. I run into him every now and then... he's become fat and ugly. To think how much I suffered for him... It'll be the same for you. - Antonio will become fat and ugly? - No. You won't even remember what he looked like. Not so sure... What I mean is you'll get by. Yes, I'll get by. No... not only that, you'll be happy. He's coming for a few days to visit his father. I'm happy for you. I can tell by your face that you're lying. The legendary Giò in the flesh! It'll be fantastic. - Is that better? - Yes. What'll you do with Antonio tomorrow? Celebrate his birthday. Nothing more, nothing less. You are totally out of your mind. Here you go... I used lots of powdered sugar. - Thanks. - Blow it out before it melts. Make a wish. A big wish! - Ready? - Yes. One, two, three! Happy birthday, my darling! Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Well? We'll buy the rest of the furniture, you'll have more space, a room just for you. Go get your backpack or you'll be late for school. Mom and I will cut the cake. If I could go back in time I'd have 10 kids, not 2. Don't think. Smile and don't think. That's what I always do. - Why are you here at this hour? - Major emergency. Can you do my hair just like it is in this photo? Hey, we're closed. Sorry, I just passed by to say hi. Come here. I'm glad you came but I have to meet my dad at the lawyer's. I'll see you tonight though. Bye. You get prettier every time. You okay? I hurt my knee, no gym for me today. Fine, no problem. They're just playing volleyball. I know it can't be easy for you here. It's an old school full of prejudices. - You probably expected better. - I expected nothing. At times, they seem like animals to me too. I wish I could grab them and shake their empty heads. You need to be strong, that's what I'm saying. You have to be stronger than them. understand? Sorry. All right, see you later. Teach? You don't need to worry about me, I'm stronger than them. I am. Hi! - Did you miss us? - Sure, like crazy. Hi Blu, how are you? Fine. Grandma says hi and wants you to visit her. I will one of these days, okay? Going out? We just got back. I have plans. We'll catch up tomorrow. Going to Giò's? I heard he's back. There's no way to keep a secret around here... - What's he doing here? - He brought you a little gift. Why the fuck are you here? To wish you a happy birthday and give you this gift. Get lost, okay? Get out of here! I brought you a gift, I'm not leaving. - Get lost, faggot. Leave him alone. - I'm not afraid. Happy birthday. Have a good birthday. Get lost! Get lost! We have a very special guest tonight: Lorenzo! - So happy to have you here. - Thanks. So you're now an icon worldwide. I am. In fact... I'd like to thank my fans. I owe it all to them, thanks! What were your teenage years like? Were you popular in school? Those were the greatest years of my life. I was loved by my many friends. I'll never forget those years, the years of my youth. It was all so magical. You'll never find friends like the ones you had then. You're still the best. How many girls did you compare me with in Milan? Me? I'm home all day studying and thinking about you. Yeah, right... You don't believe me? Then you're way off because I spend my nights watching our video. - What video? - From last year. My graduation party here. - There's a video? - Yes. Vittorio sent it to me. I didn't know we were being filmed. What do you care, it's just for us, nobody put it online. Who do you think I am? Want to see it? Want to see it? You're beautiful. Here... Hi, baby. No, let's wait till they leave. Come on, it's just me and you. - You're beautiful. - Get off! It's just me and you, relax. Come on, what's the big deal? Come here. - I don't want to! - Come on, sweetie. Like it? My love, my love. It's me, my love. - I'm embarrassed. - Embarrassed of what? We're all friends, come on! - I know you like it. - I want to go home. Home? Forget about it. Come on! I don't believe you fell off of Blu's scooter. I don't believe you fell off of Blu's scooter. I did, I swear. I was horsing around and slipped, I'm lucky I didn't bang my head. I'm coming to school tomorrow to talk to your teachers. Why talk to them? I want to make sure that someone didn't do this to you. Okay, it was Blu. She caught me stealing her lipstick. Lorenzo, knock it off. I'm coming to school tomorrow. Hi. Keep it down, dad's trying to get Luca to sleep. Every time we go away he gets riled up. What happened? What happened, Blu? I didn't want to, mom. I saw myself. I didn't understand a thing, but I didn't want to! - It's nothing, leave us alone. - What's wrong? - Davide, just leave us alone. - Go back to bed. Calm down. No matter what happened, Whatever it is we'll straighten it out. It was all bullshit! I did what they told me to do but I didn't understand, because I never understood shit! They, who? What are you talking about? Lorenzo! I'm sorry... I don't know what got into me. I'm sorry. STILL WITH GIÒ? ANTONIO KISSED ME. CALL ME Antonio! Antonio! Antonio! Let's split up. Calm... you need to stay calm. Breathe. Like that. Don't be afraid, Antonio. It all depends on you. Bravo. He probably told everyone by now. Blu already knows what happened, everyone at school knows too. Lorenzo's made it public by now. Breathe... Bravo, like that. You left but only after a while. You stood there. And you went to him. You went looking for him at his house. Didn't you? And you even liked it, right? You liked it. You're the one who... Antonio! Antonio! You hit it! Bravo! Bravo. - Good morning. - Morning, what's this? For once I prepared things. Get Renato. If you're trying to persuade me to not come to school, forget it. Everything's fine, nothing happened. You don't need to see my teachers. Neither Renato nor I believe you fell off of the scooter. Fine, I can't hide anything from you. It was just a mishap while clowning around with friends. Friends don't put you in this state, if they do they're not friends. At our age it happens. We cleared things up, it's all fine. Trust me. I'll go get ready now. Oh, don't wash this shirt. - Why? - I want to frame it. How's Blu? She'll be fine. We'll all be fine... - I can't find it. - What are you looking for? Don't be afraid. We're here to press charges. No, Pavan, I warned you, I won't let you in today. All right, fine. But this is the last time. Well? LORENZO FUCKS ANTONIO Everything will be fine, you did the right thing. Excuse me... - What's going on? - A boy's been killed at school. Dear Blu, this is the last letter I'm going to write you. I started because I didn't want you to forget what being 16 was like. But now there's no point. I know that you will never forget what's happened. You can't forget it. Actually, I know what's happened will be with you every day, you'll try your best to forget it, but in vain. Because Lorenzo and Antonio will always be with us. And I think there's something we should do. Something you should do when you're older, because right now I don't have the strength to. You have to share this story, tell people what happened. And tell people it didn't have to end like that. It didn't have to end like that. Things could've been different. We all could've been different. We could've been better, stronger. You have to tell people this one day. That it wouldn't have taken much. We just had to be less afraid. It wouldn't have taken much, Blu. And we would've managed to be happy. Lorenzo, I don't think this is what I want, not now at least. - So what now? - Let's go for a swim like we planned. Everything fine with you two? Fine, everything's fine. We have time.
