We are the outcasts of the world. But I will never forsake my brothers. Even if I am labelled, I won't back down. My life is mine to decide. Ray! - Ray! - Hurry up! Hurry up! We're running out of time! Don't hit me! Go away, stop. - They're coming, hurry! - Didi, hurry! Didi, your hand! Your hand! Ray! Stop! Don't hit me! - Get off me! - Ray! Get off me! Don't hit me! Why are you back? Ray. Ray! Nice! Quiet. Get down! Quiet. Get down! GENTLE EDUCATION Useless! In or out, you are useless. Lock him up. The two years in prison with my boys were difficult, but the most unforgettable. Didi is tall and tough, but he's a softie. Get in line. Nanyo is loud, but without him our days would be so boring. Fatty Royce dreams about driving Rolce Royce. - Count off. - One. Two. Ray is back from his field trip. - Ray... - Ray... Gui, my boy Quen's other brother, a lone wolf in Xin Prison. Our history is complicated. I thought you got out? Mr. Kao, for some reason, we don't get along. Ever since he got here, - we've been having fights. - Sit back down. - Go back! - Sit back down! What's this? A riot? You little jerks are ungrateful. If you don't want to eat on a table... All right. You can eat dung off the floor like dogs that you are. Bring the plates. Lay down. - Lay down. - Lay down. The new warden is here and you tried to escape. Are you messing with me? Get down. Get down. I repeat once, get down. Get down! We've never had a chick warden before. A chick! How can she manage this place? Warden. Please be seated. I'd like to discuss an idea of music curriculum. Using music to guide them. - Yesterday... - Warden, these kids used to play with guns and knives. Now you want them to play drums and sax. It's a little unrealistic. May I ask, of all the things we tried before has anything helped them? Officer Feng, I'm still waiting on the prison break report. And... this is your warning. CONCERT BAND RECRUITMENT LOOKING FOR MEMBERS INTERESTED IN MUSIC... Darn it! Who would join this gay band? They say we have a music genius here. - Me... - Me... Warden, the second-hand instruments are here, but no one signed up. Maybe they need a little push. Join and get extra parole points! This orchestra is not for jerks like them. Ray! Sign up! Put my name in, Wen Di Chung. Yes, quick. Go away! Don't push, just sign up. Sign up and go away. - Me, too. - Don't push. Be careful. How's the recruit for a music teacher? No applicants yet. Warden, who would teach music in a prison? I may know someone. What a babe! No way! Is this a dream? -Hi, everyone -Teacher, I can't hear you. Hi, everyone, my name is Shuning. I'm Xiao Yue. Teacher, are you single? Your skirt is a little too long. Why are you here? I know. She is an angel, here to save our souls. I know - you are curious about us. - No. You're wrong. We are interested in getting parole. Yes. You get parole points if you win The Northern High Music Competition. First and second will qualify for the finals. - First and... - Second... How's that possible? Ray... The last one. How long do we have to stay in this horrible place? You have it better than I do. I got two more months than you. When I get out and win the lottery, I'll buy a Rolce Royce. When I'm out, I want to be an actor, maybe for a movie. No, you are only good for adult films. After all, my name is 'adult entertainer'. Wait! Didi, what are you gonna do when you're out? Didi. By the way, Ray, today at music class, Chi slapped Didi I shouldn't have laughed, sorry. - Go to die. - Fight! Really? A hard slap. When you're not around, we get bullied. Maybe you should just join? Ray, don't you want parole? Quen. Quen! Today we'll be assigning instruments. Teacher, he is all yours. Ray. Ray, you're here. Ray. Ray, you're here. I thought you said the class is full. A band only needs 24 members. Yeah. Anyone who is interested in music is welcomed. Welcome! Zhen Nan, clarinet. Wen Di Chang, sleigh bells. You... Flute? Clarinet? The real reason you're here is to feel like you've helped some convicts and leave after you're done. People like us, we'll go back to fixing cars. What did you think you could change? If you are going to be difficult, I will decide for you. Amitabha Amitabha Amitabha Amitabha I heard you joined the band. To look after my bros. Bro. One. Two. One. Officer Mad Dog. Once I'm out, I'll kill him. One. One. What's up? Two hours. He drilled us for two hours. Officer Mad Dog is a jerk. He treats us like dogs. You can't play like this. Take a break. Mr. Kao, this suits you. Stop. I said stop. What are you doing? Darn it! Stop! Stop! I said stop! No. This is for music, not for fighting. Ms. Yen, how is the class? It's been slow, they are all beginners. And they are usually worn out from gym class. They can't even practice. I agree. We spent so much money on instruments. If they can't practice, it would be a waste. Warden, I suggest we hold a talent show, so we can see their progress. Sure. Let's arrange that for Moon Festival. Show everyone what our boys can do. I believe they will do great. Oh yeah, Ray. Why were you so annoyed this morning? Who wouldn't be annoyed at Kao's face? True. Why do you guys keep fighting? Yeah, why are we so bad? What's your problem? You really think music is going to pay the bills? Learn something practical. Class dismissed. Show me your hand. The other one. Gui. Pay my respects to the band. If they fall apart, I'll make sure you're taken care of. Before Moon Festival, I'll make sure you get parole. I've never seen Gui on duty. Sorry... What are you doing? I'll get you another bowl. Family members, face-to-face visits are only allowed during holidays. For safety, we will be doing body searches. Here, eat. Dad, has Red been bothering the office? Don't worry. Once Gui is out, he'll lead PR. Sir. Your mother insisted I get these cakes. She said it's your favourite. You two, protect each other in here. Why didn't my mom come? Your mother is not feeling well due to chemo. She decided to stay home. Get out. Why is my dad here? Why is my dad here? Do a good job. Don't let the kids beat us. Don't worry, Ray. That secret music genius is actually me. I gotta go to the bathroom! Okay, go. Now, for the grand finale you've all been waiting for. A performance by Xin Prison orchestra. Drummer is off tempo. Who are you complaining at? Chi is off-key. He's always off-key. He sucks at this. Who put super glue on my clarinet? You guys ruined Chi's clarinet. Don't blame us for your dirty hands. He had his clarinet the whole time. You sound like a funeral. Did your mom die or something? Tell your boy to watch his mouth. Did you mom die or something? Say that again. Did you mother die? Darn it! Go away! Is this how you learn music? Enough! You guys wanted to know why we want to teach music here. Thief! You thief! Here, for you, I remember you wanted this ocarina. 13 years ago Shuning's brother was sent to this prison for theft and negligent homicide. He got into some trouble, and died in the fight. When Shuning heard they were recruiting, she gave up her chance to go to New York and insisted on coming here. She wanted understand her brother's life, hoping to make a change with music. But I guess... we failed. Yes. Thanks for handling the sponsorships. Okay. Alright. Dad, I'm going upstairs. Hold on. You said you quit the band to teach music. I am teaching music. In a prison. After so many years, you still won't let go. His prison needed a music teacher. I believe it's fate. What about your fate? We finally have a chance to play at Carnegie Hall. The most iconic concert hall. I've waited so many years. You even took Xiao Yue with you for some inmates that you don't know. You said music brings out the good in people. Then why shouldn't they learn music? Trying to teach them about symphony. It's like talking to a wall. That performance today is a disgrace to classical music. You think only the upper class deserves classical music? Carnegie Hall is only to satisfy your ego. Listen to yourself. I sent you to music school. I even got you a stage. - We were going to... - That's your stage. Not mine. Shuning isn't too bad. Didi, I hear Kao's mom is not well. She's dying. No wonder he overreacted. The performance was a mess. You yourselves were a mess, too. What a disgrace to Xin Prison. Did you know that? Today, we won't be talking. Think about what you wanna say to me and to everyone. Tell it through music. One, two, three, four is downbeat. One and two and three and four, is upbeat, it's the accented beat. Got it? These days, don't you think they are a bit different? They've changed a lot Are you really not going back? I need more time. The air outside is even fresher. Remember what you promised me. Who did this? Your fights are getting out of hand. We didn't do this. Come on. Warden, the band destroyed the music classroom, broke the windows making too much noise. They are disturbing my classes. Warden, they didn't do those things. Ms. Yen, maybe you don't know them. Do you really believe them? Fighting is what they do. Who else would it be? I apologise. We will leave the music classroom. I'll find somewhere else to practice. But we will be competing. Stop. Protect the instruments from the rain. Hurry... Take your instruments... Gather around. The pause between sighs Look at the tears in the rain I admit I am glad This sudden rain Do you ever regret coming here? I'd rather regret than do nothing. Won't you regret giving up your dreams? Honestly, a little bit. Isn't that how life is? No matter what you do, there will be regrets. But you choose what to fight for. You also made a choice, didn't you? When you shut me out and deny my love Sometimes I am lost but never afraid I will try my best to be here for you If this keeps up, we won't be able to compete. I'll prove he sees them wrong. Amitabha. Amitabha. Amitabha. - Solo. - Didi, help me You broke the windows. Why are you on his side? No one tells me what to do. They are working hard for parole and you're sabotaging it. Quen is my only brother. Get these back to the warehouse. That officer Mad Dog... Someday I'll break his nose, spit on his face, egg his office. Are you rapping? How do we clean this place? Are you sure? One. Two. One. Two. - Warden. - How? One. One. Two, one. What's going on? Warden, my leg cramped. This is a basketball class. Why aren't you playing basketball? Warden, we're warming up. Class is almost over, still warming up? Please stick to the curriculum. I will. Warden, can we use the warehouse for our band practices? But it's full of stuff. They're all junk. I know we messed up last time. We're not as good as others, but we can improve. If we give up now, then it is really over. Secretary Sung will handle this. Get back. Alright! This is our new home. Dinner time, let's go! - Let's eat! - It's dinner time! Did you hear violin? Maybe. Was that not you? I didn't know about your mom. I'm sorry. Attention! The competition is tomorrow. How are we doing so far? Warden. We are the meanest orchestra... Good luck. You on the wooden fish. Don't mess up. Worry about yourself. According to regulation 4, rule 6 to protect inmate's identity face masks are mandatory. As you can see on the screen, Xin Prison orchestra is entering the venue. Sir, these inmates, will they cause danger to others? What you looking at? They are inmates! Sir! Now, let us welcome Xin Prison orchestra's debut show. - Are they inmates? - Students? They're juvenile convicts. Juvenile convicts? Who let them in the competition? Are you kidding? Really? - So many people. - Yes. Royce. What's up? I was always punished as a kid. It feels weird to be cheered for. This is my first time on TV. Big deal. It's my second time. Second time? The first time I was being arrested for stabbing. It scared my pants off. Announcing the winners, second place, Ren Jen High School first place, Wen Da High School. They will compete in the finals. To have competed with these pros and win 3rd place is amazing. Don't be discouraged. Third place is useless, that doesn't get us parole. Sir, your mother fell into coma, she's in the ICU. Please tell her to wait for me. I'm gonna try to get parole. Your mother is not feeling well due to chemo, she decided to stay home. Visits are useless, might as well stay in the hospital. Her body was found this morning tied and thrown in the alley It's over. The competition is over. There is involvement in the marriage or another situation. Stay tuned for updates. Live from the music competition. Ren Jen High school violated regulations by hiring a non-student. They have been disqualified. Xin Prison orchestra will replace them and compete in the finals. Stay tuned for updates Quiet! Quit yelling! Be quiet. Sit down, eat your food! Be quiet! Who's making noise? Parole for running errands? What about my parole? Warden wouldn't approve. But don't worry, I'll apply again in two months. If I'm not mistaken, Quen's death anniversary is in a few months. Think about it. If no one visits his grave, he'll be so lonely. Don't mess with me. Darn it! This is crazy. What are you doing? Who did this? We have to catch this guy. What about the surveillance camera? To the control room. Let's go. You're like the classiest gangster. Violin. Has Red been causing trouble? I'm meeting him tomorrow. - Tomorrow... - Focus on your show. I got this. I'm Quen! I can handle it. I got this, don't worry. Quen. Quen. Quen. Quen. What are you doing here? Why did you let my brother go alone? - I'm sorry, I didn't mean... - Get out! Get out! Red! What are you doing here? Nothing. I was just thinking if I could fix these. But we can't afford to buy new instruments. Take a break. Let me try. Maybe we could tape them. Forget it, I'll think of something. Officer Feng, I know you don't like the band. You don't have to break the instruments. You are their councillor. According to the rules, Faculty destroying prison property gets a major warning. You have 3 major warnings. I'm letting you go. Warden. You're right, I don't like the band, but there's no evidence that I did it. I was explaining to Gui why his parole didn't pass. After I left, he got upset and broke the instruments. I did some investigation. The broken classroom window, he did it as well. Surveillance camera caught it all. I can show you. Warden, don't worry. I'll take care of this. I'll get to the bottom of this. What? I didn't do this to you. Officer Feng did. Shuning, what are you doing here? I'm here to apologise. Because of me your schedule was delayed. I think you all know Xiao Yue and I went to teach music in prison. It was one of the most difficult and challenging times in my career. I remember the first time I walked in, I was so nervous. I started doubting myself. So I asked myself, why do I study music? To move people? To be at peace? There are so many places we can reach with music. Music may be the key to improve these kids' lives. If they win, they will get parole and go back to their families. Now, I need your help as a favour for me. What do we even bother? Let's just go. Don't celebrate too soon. We need to find a new way to perform. Do something extraordinary. Otherwise, it'll be difficult to stand out. So... I've asked each teacher to show us some solos. Please watch. Even if I'm the music genius, I couldn't play this solo. If we don't have a solo, we can't win the finals? We've only been playing for 6 months. I don't want to play anymore. That's it. 52 DAYS TO GO FOR COMPETITION Give me your hand. Done. Gui. Where is he? In the shower. Still? Yes, sir. You broke your promise. Why are you helping him? It's not Ray's fault. Quen's life, I'll pay it my way. 35 DAYS TO GO FOR COMPETITION Violin is the key. Practice harder, so we have a chance to win. Dismissed. Attention. - Warden. - Have a seat. You all performed very well. I've talked to the chief. We are granting parole to... Ray. Here. - Si Wen. - Here. -Zhen Nan -Here. Warden, but we didn't win anything. We promised parole, if you win first place. But we've made an exception to give points for participation. The rest of you, don't be discouraged. If you win the finals, there's still a chance. Congratulations. Nanyo. We're out! What about the band? Should we stay? No way. I miss my grandma. Then get your things. Mr. Kao, we just lost 3 members, what do we do? Have a good life. I don't want you to go. No. I want you to be free. No. What? You're worried you'll get bullied? Alright. If you get bullied, find Mr. Kao. He's got your back. Don't worry, okay? Also, I always thought sleigh bells look dumb on you. You're laughing at him? Don't forget how stupid you look. Take a wooden fish. Amitabha -Amitabha -Amitabha -Amitabha -Amitabha -Amitabha -Amitabha Thanks. Ray. You saved my life. Thanks. Hurry. What time is it? They're late. This is mine. Ray! It's ripped. Ray.

Balloons here. Come on, kids. - There are balloons here. - Hello. Hello, kids. To relive their childhood, they took a job in an amusement park. We're gonna draw your favourite things today. Why do you have patterns on your arm? It's a dinosaur. Didi became a kindergarten teacher. Teaching kids to draw. - Mom... - Mr. Kao stayed with his mom, until she passed away. Nanyo became an actor as a dead body. Boss. Let's go with Take 40. Who said you could move? Sorry, sir. I have a gig later. I'm late. We are not done yet. Acting is too difficult.
