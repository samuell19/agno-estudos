We're at 130 feet, 10 degrees down. You got target zig. Contact bearing... Ahh! Whew! So-- So, Doc, you, uh, think you can make it so I got a scar? Sure, tough guy. How big you want it? Not too big. Just so it's noticeable. What, is this for your girlfriend? Well, it's for all the future girls. Uh-huh. You're gonna need a story to go with this. Oh, no, I got a story, but it's too painful for me to tell. General quarters, all hands, man your stations. Commander Krieg. Carry on, petty officer. Aye, sir. Watch that ladder! Let's go! Let's go! To the forward compartment! Go! Right full rudder. All ahead three-quarter. 5-degree down bubble. Aye, sir. Right full rudder. All ahead three-quarter. 5-degree down bubble. Sonar, conn. What do you have? Conn, sonar. Contact. 4,000 yards and closing, sir. They're right behind us. Rig for stealth. Aye, sir. Rig for stealth. Give me a firing solution, Commander. Aye, sir. Give me a firing solution. Aye, aye, sir. Flood tubes one and four. Flood tubes one and four. Aye. Range? Range 3,400 yards, sir. 10 seconds to stealth, Captain. Range? Range 3,000 yards and closing, sir. Sonar, target bearing? Sir, we've lost contact. Trying to re-establish. He's gonna turn and hit us. Right full rudder, 10-degree down bubble. Right full rudder, 10-degree down bubble. Aye. Where is that firing solution, Commander? We have it now, sir. Sonar, talk to me. Nothing, sir. We can't find her. Damn it. We are locked. - Fire one. - Aye, sir. Fire one. - Fire two. - Aye, sir. Fire two. Sir, we have fish in the water, 1,200 yards and closing. Crash dive, 20-degree down bubble. Crash dive, 20-degree down bubble. Aye. Torpedo range, 600 yards and closing. Time to target? Conn, sonar. 20 seconds, sir. Launch port countermeasures. Launch port countermeasures. Aye. - Come on. - Ugh. Your signal is destroyed. Simulation complete. Damn! That's it! That's it! We did it, gentlemen. Great work! Great work! Good work, Bill. Thank you, sir. The most powerful Navy in the world is now invisible. Yes, it is a bad day for the bad guys. Son of a... Conn, commo. Captain Richards wishes to speak to you, sir. This is the captain. Captain, this exercise is terminated. Congratulations. Everyone in Washington will be pleased to know that this stealth technology has been proven effective under combat conditions. Great job out there, Brad. Yeah, thanks. Oh, by the way, happy retirement. Thanks for reminding me. We're headed back to Reykjavik Harbor. Out. Send fire control party. Think you pissed him off. Yeah, that's because I get to play with this puppy and he doesn't. Fitting way to end your career, skipper. Thanks, Bill. Wish I could say the same. You know they've got plans for all of us. Come on. Believe me, I know. You know, most guys would look at your reassignment to the Pentagon as what it is-- an honor. I've earned the right to have my own command. You know that. Whether I agree with you or whether I don't, it's out of our hands. I don't mean to put a damper on your last day, skipper. No, no, it's okay. I mean, we all have our way of dealing with change. Indeed we do. Okay, Doc, so let's go over this again. Once you're at missile launch, you've got three choices. First, you can just send that nasty thing to your target. Second, if you want to change your mind about who you want to nuke, you can pick a secondary target. Or if you want to disarm it, you just put in the code and it self-destructs. It's pretty simple. Yeah, see how simple it is to put the hammer to 20 million people? Oh, well, if you're having second thoughts there, Doc, then maybe you should just stick to medicine. Just because you'd rather be home watching some game on high-def on DIRECTV... to me, this is the life. What more you got? All right, fine. Here's the code book. It has all the self-destruct codes, but they change every day, so you got to stay up-to-date before you come on duty. So if you want to try that one, just put it in, and then it would self-destruct. Mayday, mayday, mayday! This is the fishing vessel the Cypress Point. We are taking on water. I repeat, we are taking on water. X.O. on the conn. - Sir. - You okay? Yes, sir. Just a bit of a headache. Well, there's a fishing boat out there. It's about four miles away. Apparently, it's been taking on a lot of water. The captain wants to abandon ship. There's a NATO patrol boat, it's about two hours away. We'll just monitor the situation with the fishing boat - until they get there. - Right. Sir, one of the drills scheduled for this mission is a rescue at sea. It would seem to me to be the perfect opportunity to test the efficiency of reduced crew under an actual emergency situation. What do you say? I think it's a good idea. - Hey, Doc. - What's on the menu? Shepherd's pie with your choice of creamed corn, string beans, or cauliflower. Yeah, I think I'll pass. Doc, uh... how long are you gonna use my storeroom for your rack? People are beginning to talk. You know, you'd think with a crew this size, a man could get some peace and quiet, wouldn't you? Life on a boomer. Wake me when it's pizza night. That's not till Friday. Exactly. Close the hatch. You sleep tight, little Doc. Petty officer, let's get these people on deck as soon as possible. Have their captain report to the conn. Let's get a move on! Every second we spend on the surface is one second too long. Get these people to the conn. Thank you. Sir, captain and crew of the fishing boat. Captain, I'd like to welcome you and your entire crew aboard the USS Montana. Thank you, sir. Hey, they got weapons. What the hell do you think you're -- Not now, Captain. We're taking the boat. Garrett, disperse your men. Let's go! Move! - Hands! - Steady. - Get up! - Nobody move! Everybody, hands in the air! All right, don't shoot. Don't shoot. - Don't fire. - Take it easy. Easy. - Do as they say. - All right. Take it easy. Go down! I got every single one of you out here. Down. Don't look. Come on. Get up. Get up. Get up. Ugh. Come on! Move it! Let's go. - Go! - Quick. - Right on. - You! What the hell are you gonna do with my men? They'll be fine. Hey, Garrett, put them on a boat. But don't worry. They'll have you there to supervise them. You are out of your damn mind. I finally have my command. Get this man off my sub. Just a second. I might need this. I'll see you at your court-martial. Go! Go! Move! Everybody out! Wait for it. - Move! - Move. Lieutenant, I believe you have something I want. That's it. I'll take the key. Get off my sub. When you hear your name called, report to duty station. Campbell, take the helm. Romano, weapons control. Ranovsky, planesman. Rosen, Chang, get that safe open and get me those firing keys now. Garrett, have your men report to mess to await instructions once we're under way. Move along. Move. I got it. I got it. Step up the ladder. Go, next! Next! You. Stroke. Let's go! - Yeah, okay. - Portside. All right, get up there. - All right. - Secure it, team. Let's go! One at a time. Go. Okay. Come on. Lieutenant, let's get all these men on board. All right, you heard him. Let's make sure everybody's accounted for. All right. - Sir? - Yeah? I was able to smuggle this off the sub. A radio. Great work. Thank you, sir. What about those dewatering pumps? - Are they usable? - We're down below, sir. To any ship, any ship. This is Captain Daniel Lewis of the USS Montana. Commander, we're picking up a distress call from Captain Lewis and the crew of the Montana. They have a radio? I told you we should kill them. You were supposed to check them. Sir, that NATO patrol boat is heading in our direction. They're responding to Captain Lewis' distress call. Get out of my sight. Mr. Allenson, take us down to periscope depth. Aye, aye, sir. Make our depth 150 feet. Attention, this is your captain. First, I want to congratulate you all on a job well done. We are now the proud owners of the world's most powerful nuclear submarine. The only one of its kind, in fact. We will proceed to the East Coast of the United States, where we will hold the city of Washington, D.C., for ransom. Our price is $1 billion. That is billion with a "B." Once our demands are met, we will then proceed to other sources of income-- London, Rome, Zurich. Once we have amassed enough wealth to buy our safety, we will then disperse and live the lives others can only dream about. Each of you has been chosen for your own particular strengths, and I know I can count on you to do whatever needs to be done to carry out and complete this mission. That is all. Commander, the NATO vessel is demanding that we surface immediately. I am captain of this sub, Mr. Gerard, and you will address me as such. Yes, sir, Captain. Hmm. Mr. Allenson, bring it up on the board. Aye, sir. Target settings, the NATO ship and the fishing boat. Range 1,000 yards. Open torpedo doors two and three. Aye, sir. Open torpedo doors two and three. Sir, is this absolutely necessary? They have made it necessary, Mr. Allenson. Fire torpedoes. Fire torpedoes. Fire torpedo two. Fire torpedo three. I'd say we're off to a good start. Have you contacted naval headquarters? Aye, sir. Your message has been sent. Good. Yes? Mr. President, we have a situation. What is it? One of our submarines, the USS Montana, has been hijacked by terrorists led by the sub's X.O., a Commander William Krieg. Also, a NATO patrol boat has gone missing in that same area. We fear she might have been fired upon by the Montana. Montana? That's the stealth prototype, isn't it? I'm afraid so, sir. Well, have them take us to orange alert. Yes, sir. Enter. Sir, this just came in on the emergency channel. "Emergency aboard USS Montana. Possible casualties. Hold your current position and await further orders." What do you think that means? I wish I knew. What are you guys doing here? Get off my sub! Whiskey 11, this is Whiskey 14. OTH is clear, over. - Mr. President. - Please be seated. We have it, sir. Well, then, let's hear it. Gentlemen, I am William Krieg of the USS Montana. It is my duty to inform you as of 23:00 hours this evening, I have assumed control of this vessel. The Navy never saw fit to give me my own command, so I have taken it. And since I'm in the driver's seat, so to speak, I thought I would indulge myself a little. I want $1 billion or I'm going to blow the city of Washington, D.C., off the map. As you probably know, the Montana is a one-of-a-kind submarine, equipped with 24 trident ballistic missiles, and, of course, there's always the matter of that stealth technology. $1 billion sounds like a lot, I know, but look at it this way-- $1 billion, and everyone on Pennsylvania Avenue gets to wake up in the morning. Not a bad deal, right? It is now 03:00. You have 18 hours. Instructions on how I'd like the funds transferred will be forthcoming. That is all. Mr. President, we're being redirected to a secure location. The Joint Chiefs are en route and will be standing by for briefings upon your arrival. - Make it happen. - Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am. Right away. Communications room, respond. Communications secure. And, engine room, respond. Sir, I can't raise Hernandez or Edwards. Well, send someone down to check on them. Set the course. I'll be in my quarters. Aye, sir. Helmsmen, change course to heading 260. All ahead three-quarters to off the coast of Maryland. Aye, sir. Garrett? I'm here, Mr. Allenson. Hernandez and Edwards aren't responding. Send someone to look for them in the engine room. - Right. - Got it. Stand by. What happened? Where's Edwards? He's dead. Let's move out. Enter. Sir, we have a problem. This is your captain. We have one of the original crew members still on board. This man is extremely dangerous. If you see him, report his position immediately. That is all. Hey! You were supposed to do a headcount, Mr. Allenson. I was told everyone was accounted for. Yes, sir, and that information came from Mr. Gerard, chief of the boat. Gerard, you were responsible for off-loading my crew, were you not? Conn, come in. This is the captain. Get off my sub. Who is this? Mr. Garrett. We're on it, Captain. Find him and bring him to me. Yes, sir. Atten-hut! Good evening, Mr. President. Area's been secured. Joint Chiefs are standing by to brief you, sir. - Thank you, top. - Aye, aye, sir. Atten-hut! At ease. Admiral. Thank you for letting us into your home, Mr. President. What do we know? He's got stealth technology, and he's threatening Washington, D.C. He's already torpedoed one NATO patrol vessel and an unidentified fishing vessel. What are they actually capable of doing to Washington? The truth of the matter is the Montana is capable of outrunning and outgunning everything else in our Navy. There's a chance that he could beat our intercept missile, and we wouldn't even see it because it's invisible to sonar. How fast can this Montana actually go? 10 knots faster than anything we got. Don't we have safeguards to prevent the launching of nuclear missiles from submarines? Yes, it takes two keys to effect a missile launch. The captain has one and the weapons control officer. Yeah, all right. I want all available resources brought into this area. I want the entire East Coast blanketed with as many ships and aircraft as we can muster. Then I want to know everything there is to know about this Commander Krieg. Is he a lunatic acting alone, or is he part of something bigger? Call Katie McCallister at the Central Intelligence Agency. Tell her I need her here yesterday. She's already on her way, sir. Thank you. Assuming you're correct, Admiral, let's get in touch with Captain Richards onboard the Florida. Have him track the last known position of the Montana. Sir. Good work. Take this to Missile Control and stand by. Yes, sir. You know, I'm thinking. Maybe we should give the President a little show, something that proves we're serious and have the ability and the balls to carry out our threat. Sir, you've already sunk a NATO boat and torpedoed your Montanacrewmates. I think you've made your point. I want to believe you, Mr. Allenson. I do. But knowing the Joint Chiefs, they've got everything under the sun gunning for us right now. What's so special about that spot? Nothing. It's in the middle of nowhere. Sir, if we launch a nuclear warhead, everyone's gonna know where we are. There. Now, prepare to launch. Yes, sir. Weapons? Ready to launch. Ready to launch, sir. Prepare for missile launch. I repeat, prepare for missile launch. Ready. Fire. Activating countermeasures. Sir, you've been ordered to find and follow the Montana. Sir? Air-tac is clear, sir. Is that what I think it is? Mr. President? The Montana just launched a warhead. Our satellites just picked it up. We're getting a lock on it now. - Stand by for the rating! - Tracking the location! Almost there. Nice! Okay. A 5-megaton warhead was just detonated in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Oh! Aah! Shut it down. I can't. They'll kill me. I'm gonna ask one more time. Aah! All right. - Shut it down! - Get away from him. You use that scatter gun, you'll kill us both. Is that what you want? You guys need me. I'm the only one that can maintain the reactor. Go on. Move out of the way. Keep moving. Follow us, he's dead. Stay back! I mean, where's he gonna go? Just stay back! - Ah! - Oh! Koenig, stay with him. Cline. Don't move. Don't you move. - Piersall? - Doc? Damn, Doc. What the hell is going on? Commander Krieg has lost his mind. He's taken over the sub. Have you seen any of our other crew? Uh, no, I ain't seen nobody, but they know I'm here. Everybody's been looking for me. Okay. Do you know how far down these crawl spaces run? Uh, yeah. They run all the way down to the stern almost. There's two of them. There's this one and the one below. That's right. Good. We're gonna need them to get around. What are we gonna do? We're gonna take our sub back. - Say what? - You heard me. Come on. Gerard, get me the President on the line. I want to make sure he saw our show. Aye, aye, sir. Commander. Mr. President. I hope you now see I am both capable and willing of using the weapons at my disposal. I can just as easily detonate a warhead over a populated area. Krieg, what is it that you want from us? Only what I've asked for, Mr. President. I will send you the instructions for the wire transfer of $1 billion. Do not attempt to alter this plan in any way. That is all. Clear. This way. Oh! Ugh! Ah! - Ah! - You okay? H-how bad is it? Let's see. You're lucky. It's a through-and-through. Come on. On three. One, two, three. - Aah! Ah! - Over on the desk. Just take it easy. Take it easy. You'll be all right. - You all right? - Yeah. Oh. Yeah, you've got a story for your girl now, I tell you what. Here you go. Ah! Oh! Ah! - Didn't hurt, did it? - No more than getting shot. Listen, I want you to wait here till the bleeding stops. Where you going? I'm gonna go out there and raise some hell, see if I can slow them down a little bit till the Navy finds us. No, man. You're gonna get yourself killed. You know how to use one of these, right? Yeah, of course. Here. I'll call you if I need you, all right? Good luck. Garrett? I'm here. Find him? There's two of them. One of them went after the reactor. Dugan stopped them. I want an armed guard in the reactor control room immediately. Already taken care of. Find them before they screw this up for all of us, you hear me? Let's split up. Cover more ground. Go back to the mess. Call me if you see anything. Ugh! Cline! Cline! - Sir? - Yeah. We've just received another emergency-action message. More info on the Montana. We're to continue to plot an intercept course and pursue. Washington wants us to keep them informed and await further information. All right. Well, we started the stealth exercises here. The NATO vessel was destroyed right about there. They launched their missile from there. Now, knowing that they average about 10 knots faster than us, I'd say that we should start looking for them right about there. Well, it certainly looks like they're headed for D.C. Okay. Piersall? What do you want? Listen, I need your help. All right, man, where are you? I'm gonna come get you. No, no, no. Don't worry about that. Can you get near the communications room without being seen? Why? We're gonna reach out and touch someone. No, man. Look, just stay where you're at, and let's let the Navy handle this. Piersall... What? We are the Navy. Doc! Doc! No way. The U.N.'s asking to meet. I have no idea what to tell them. You know, there's several prime ministers who would love to have my head on a platter. - Sir? - Uh-huh. Ms. McCallister is here. Katie, have they briefed you on what's going on? Yes, Mr. President. I'm afraid I'm going to make a bad day even worse for you, sir. Take a number. What do you got? Well, what I have is quite interesting. A quick search of Commander Krieg's apartment gives us plenty to worry about, sir. He is your proverbial loose canon. Found a journal written by Krieg. Apparently he wanted us to find it. It's a series of injustices with regard to his naval career. Also, he is heavily in debt. He is behind in alimony payments to his first wife. His second wife just left him. We're trying to find her as we speak. And we found these in his quarters. What are these? Tilafon, sir. It's a drug used to shrink tumors. In particular, brain tumors. A brain tumor? Yes, sir. And one of the side effects of Tilafon is psychotic behavior. - Hey. - Hey! Yo! I'm glad you could make it. I couldn't help myself. - You ready? - For what? Follow me. Come on. Get his radio. Did you see that, man? Whoo! That's straight warfare, man. These dudes don't know who they messing with, man! Hey, you're scaring me. Oh, I'm cool, man. I'm cool. Watch the hatch. Oh, okay. First name? James. What are you doing? Where's that gonna go? Satellite picks it up, bounces it over to one of our ships, and they pass it along to Washington. The President's gonna see my name? If we live through this, they'll make a movie about us. Oh! I'm up for that. Who you think's gonna play me? Denzel? I was thinking someone more like Sammy Jackson. Oh, that's cool, too, man. I mean, Sam Jackson, Denzel, whatever. That's cool. Here we go. Do it. Buoy away. Sir, somebody just launched a comm buoy from the communications shack. Sir, we've picked up the signal from a communications buoy on our long-range radar. The entry code matches the Montana's. Hold our present course. Steady as she goes. Aye, aye, sir. Communications, conn. Communications, conn. Hegan? Hegan is unavailable right now. Who is this? Get off my sub. Talk to me. We can work this out. There's nothing to talk about. Whoever you are, listen to me. We will find you. And when we do, you are a dead man. Your only chance to survive is to give yourself up. No, you got it backwards, Commander. I'll give you a chance to surrender, and if not, we're gonna kill every one of you. Okay. If that's the way you want to play this. Garrett, you listening to this? I'm here. Communications shack, get them. Rosen, Chang, communications now. Son of a bitch. Very good. Excuse me, sir. Yeah? We picked up a signal from a communications buoy. We're trying to pinpoint exactly where it was launched from. We're waiting for the feed now. I'll keep you posted. - As soon as you know. - Yes, sir. Watch out! Watch out! Let's go! Clear out! I knew there was going to be a problem. Every time I think I... I'm out. I know. So when are they gonna send somebody to rescue us? I wouldn't be thinking in terms of rescue right now, James. What? If they find this sub, they'll sink it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me get this straight. We've been risking our lives so the Navy can find us so they can kill us? That's about it. Well, how they gonna write a movie about me if I'm not there to tell them what happened? Listen, we got one chance at coming out of this alive, and that's taking control of this sub. How we gonna do that? We shut it down one section at a time, and we pick them off one by one. No, I can't do that. I can't. Sure you can, James. All I know is that when I got hit, you came out to help me. You can do this. So, come on. Garrett? We lost them. Mr. Garrett, you are a disappointment. - Commander. - Sir, it checks out. That communications buoy was released from the Montanaitself. By whom? Apparently two of the original crew are still on board. Commander, hazard me a guess. Where is she? All right. Well, we left her here. The communications buoy was found right about there. So I would imagine that she's somewhere right around here. And we're here. Yes, sir. They got the reactor room covered. If you really want to mess with these guys, we should go after the electrical switchboards. Let's go. Mr. President? Sirs. I have more information on Commander Krieg. Apparently, he sought private treatment in order to maintain his position in the Navy. He has less than a year to live. Well, what have you got on the two crew members still on board the Montana? John Ellers, the ship's medical officer, and James Piersall, an electrician's mate. Ellers is 34 years old, parents unknown. Raised in a series of foster homes until he graduated from high school. He was quite a promising young athlete and made something of a name for himself as an amateur fighter. Huh. Enlisted in the Navy at age 25. He received two years of advanced training to qualify as ship's medical officer. Performance ratings are across-the-board excellent. And Piersall? James Piersall, electrician's mate. Qualified in weapons control. Enlisted in the Navy two years ago. Transferred to submarine service six months ago. His service record... also exemplary. Good. Well, let's do whatever we can to help these two heroes by buying them some time. Let's proceed as planned. Keep the Florida tracking the Montana. We know they're heading towards the East Coast somewhere, right? Yes, sir. We still have all vessels on high alert up and down the coast. Good. Thank you. Thank you. Clear. Nice. Who are you? - Damn it. - You okay? Yeah. Well, here's the arterial system for the boat. All right. What are we gonna do? Let's cause some chaos. Uh, where should we start? With the control room. You got it. Okay, here we go. Oh, they gonna be mad. What is it? Sir, we have total loss of power. Go to auxiliary. Auxiliary is... nonfunctional. Switch to emergency generator. It should cross over immediately. Conn, electronics. How's it going up there, Captain? Don't worry about it. You can run, but you can't hide, mister. We will find you. You keep finding us, pretty soon, you won't have a crew. It's only a matter of time. Trust me. Send someone up to electrics. Rosen, Moore, find Garrett, get up to the electric room, and find out - what the hell's going on. - Aye, aye, sir. Captain... running off the generator leaves us crippled. We won't be able to maintain stealth mode. We'll be visible on sonar, and we won't be able to operate our weapons systems. Our speed will drop to a crawl. I'm aware of that, Mr. Gerard, but nautical sonar, it only has range of 35 miles, and it's a big ocean out there. Captain, we have a contact bearing 260. - Range 12,000 yards. - Sonar? Ident? Stand by, sir. Let's hope it's the Montana. Maybe their stealth went down. Contact identified as a Russian trawler. Sorry, sir. Come on. Come on, come on. Where are you? Go up there, work your way around the ship. Create as much diversion as you can. I'm gonna try and make it back to the control room. Wait-- So you want me to run around and get shot at? - Yeah. - I already done that, man. Do you see this leg? Look, we've both been shot, but that's nothing like being dead, which is what we're both gonna be if you don't help me out here. Now, come on, get up there. Damn. I don't like you, man. I know. Oh, man. Is she alive? Yes, but she's hurt bad. Get to work. See if you can fix this mess. Where's Moore? I don't know. He was right behind me. Did you hear anything? No. Son of a bitch! I didn't hear a damn thing. Get to work. Find out what's wrong. - Where are you going? - To go find Moore. Bunch of... Son of a bitch. Electric, this is the captain. This is Rosen, sir. What's the situation? They cut the wiring into the control board. It's gonna take me a while to straighten it out, sir. - How long? - I don't know. A couple hours, maybe more. How will this affect the reactor? The reactor's self-contained, sir, so it's not a problem, but until I can repair the wire, we can't use any power provided by the reactor. All right, move as fast as you can, Rosen. Yes, sir, Captain. - Mr. Gerard. - Sir. Go up to electric. I believe Mr. Rosen requires motivation. Aye, aye, sir. And find out where my goddamn money is. Yes, sir. Get up there and clear the forward compartment. Through there. Yeah. Piersall, are you there? - Is that yours? - No, what was it? - It's not mine. - Piersall! Where the hell are you? It's below us. Come on, come on! Excuse me, Mr. President. We just got a message from Krieg. He wants to know where his money is. I'm supposed to just wire-transfer him $1 billion? It's unbelievable. All right, I need you to buy us some more time. Just convince him that these things don't happen instantly. Yes, sir. Any news from the Florida? Still in pursuit, but no word. Thank you. Sir? Our long-range scanner's picking something up. It's weak, but it's big, and it's moving southwest. Could be anything. Stay on course. It won't be long now. What's taking so long? What's taking so long? Look at this mess! I'm not the electronics expert. She is. Chang, get to work. You have an hour. I'm stepping off the conn. Aye, sir. Do you have something to say to me, Mr. Allenson? No, sir. Commander. You know, you're beginning to annoy me. Well, I've decided to let you surface and get off my sub. I admire your arrogance, but so far, you haven't accomplished much, have you? No, but we decreased the surplus population on the sub. You're running out of time, mister. So are you. Sir, we have a fire in the trash room. Garrett! Come on, come on! Quick, quick! Good job, Piersall. Rosen, go down to the reactor room and make sure it's secure. If need be, put another man there and get down to the missile room. Double up on security there, as well. And what are we gonna do when we run out of men? Just do as you're told! I see him! We're going after him! Where? Give me your location. Third level, near the auxiliary machine room! Okay, come with me. I need your help bad, Piersall. Come in. You hear that? Piersall? I got him. Piersall, come in. Piersall, I've been shot. Come on, he's hurt. Let's wrap this up. Where are you? Where are you? Piersall, where are you? Where are you? Come in! Damn it! Son of a... Commander, you have three less mouths to feed. Son of a bitch. Get off my sub. Mr. President? Ah, you found me. I was just trying to get some fresh air. What's up? I've been talking with the Joint Chiefs, and the consensus is that given the capabilities of a nuclear submarine equipped with stealth technology, our chances of tracking him down are very slim. So you think I should give him what he wants? As much as it pains me to say so, yes, sir. We can always track him down later. Damn it. Sorry, Admiral. I'm just-- I'm having a hard time coping with this. For the first time, I'm truly at a loss. What do you do when one of your own turns on you? You blow him out of the water, sir. Two days ago, I would've said that Commander Krieg was one of our own and he couldn't-- he wouldn't have turned on his country, but he's mad as a hatter, and I will not set him loose on the rest of the world. Yes, sir. I will go on record as supporting your decision 100 %. I appreciate that, Bob. - More than you know. - Yes, sir. Captain, this is the X.O. Go ahead, X.O. Sir, sonar has a contact at 27 miles. She's going slow. We think it might be theMontana. I'll be right there, Commander. Change course to intercept. Hold it. Give it to me. Got to give it to you, you're good. You're real good. You better hurry up and shoot me before I kick your ass again. What? Go ahead, get it over with. Uh, what are you doing? I'm going to take him apart. Don't be stupid. Come on. Soft in the middle like I figured. Having fun? Come on, hotshot. Get up. This is what you guys were afraid of? On your feet, hotshot. Let's get this over with. Say good night, pal. Good night, pal. Electric, we're out of time. 10 minutes, Captain. 10 minutes. Captain, sonar has a positive I.D. Contact is the Montana. Sound general quarters. Set battle stations. Aye, aye, sir. Set battle stations. Battle stations, battle stations! All hands, man your battle stations. It's about damn time. Garrett. Come in, Garrett. Find as many men as you can and report back to me. Yes, sir. As you were. - We got him. - Doc! - Commander Krieg. - Captain Krieg. That will be all, Mr. Garrett. So... where's your partner? I have no idea. If I don't get my systems back, I will have failed in my mission. No, you failed as soon as you betrayed your crew. They weren't my crew, Doc. They belonged to somebody else. You were one of us. We trusted you. And I trusted the U.S. Navy. The world's a different place now, Doc. The terrorists are calling the shots, in case you hadn't noticed. Anyone with enough firepower can start their own war. We're competing on the same field as savages. This sub can't defend itself any longer. You're crippled, Commander. I will not be defeated. This is my time in history. I was destined for this. Destined for what? Extorting money from the country that trained and supported you? Doc, the money is not important. It's a symbol. It's a symbol of my superiority. My mission has always been to eradicate terrorism. Every day, for the past 20 years, that's been my mission, and now it's my ultimate goal. Let there be light. Gerard. Captain, she's done it. We're back online. Good work. Report back to the conn. I'm glad you're here, Doc. I want someone who understands the level of accomplishment here. You will bear witness to what I'm about to do. Conn, sonar. We have a contact bearing 180. Range 2,200 yards. Sonar, conn. Understood. Mr. Allenson, go to stealth mode. Aye, aye, sir. Going to stealth. Stealth in 60 seconds and counting, sir. Sonar, conn. Can you identify the contact? It's the Florida. Major. At ease. So, what have we got, gentlemen? Sir, the Florida has found the Montana and will engage. I would never have imagined ordering an American vessel to fire on one of its own. We have no other option. I appreciate that, Admiral. It doesn't make it any easier. Give me a firing solution. Flood tubes three and four. Aye, aye, sir. Flood tubes three and four. 20 seconds to stealth, Captain. Steady as she goes. You're running out of time, Commander. They're gonna shove a Mark 48 torpedo right up your ass. We'll see. 10 seconds to stealth. 9... 8... 7... We have a firing solution, sir. Very well. Ready? Flood those tubes. Fire torpedoes three and four. Aye, aye, sir. Sir, we have stealth. Very well, Mr. Allenson. Captain, sonar contact. Torpedoes. They've launched torpedoes. Sonar, conn. Range? 1,500 yards and closing, sir. Set battle stations. Right full rudder. 20-degree down bubble. - All ahead full. - Aye, aye, sir. Right full rudder. 20-degree down bubble. All ahead full. Sonar, estimated time of impact? Sir, we've lost contact again. They've gone to stealth, sir. Sonar, estimated time of impact based on last target bearing. Sir, time of impact estimated... 20 seconds. Sonar, conn. Torpedo range? Range 200 yards and closing. Launch starboard countermeasure. Aye, aye, sir. Ever have that feeling where every move you make is the right one? You mean like General Custer? Rig for impact. Number two torpedo. Range 100 yards. 75 yards. 50 yards. I think both torpedoes missed, sir. Evasive action. Hard left rudder. All ahead full. Sonar, what do you see? Negative, sir. She's gone, Captain. Mr. Gerard, get me a firing solution. Open torpedo doors one and two. Aye, aye, sir. Captain, if we counterattack and miss, these men are not ready for a shoot-out with a trained crew. We should use this time to get ourselves closer to our objectives and further away from the Florida. What would you do, Doc? Stand and fight? High noon. Meet 'em in the street head on. See who blinks, Commander. Change course to 060. All ahead full. Aye, aye, sir. Helmsman, change course to 060. All ahead full. We'll see who blinks... next time. Sir, we're taking on water in the aft torpedo room. Garrett, get as many men as you can to the aft torpedo room. Contact naval headquarters. Tell them anyone comes within five miles of us, we will launch. Aye, aye, sir. Scared, Commander? Tremble and shake. Lock this man up. Get your ass out of here. Move. Romano, Chang, meet me at the torpedo room. Now. That's good. Right here. You killed a couple of friends of mine. They didn't leave me much choice. Neither will I. You feel a headache coming on? Put it down, fool. I don't like you. Doc. Come on, man. - Move. - What's the plan, Doc? Shoot everybody that's not me. Mr. President, the Floridafailed in its attempt to destroy the Montana, sir. And Krieg has said if anybody else comes near him, he'll launch. What do you suggest, Admiral? I think we should recall all forces except the Florida, sir. I believe one vessel might be able to strike at the Montana without being detected. I agree. But let's give ourselves some breathing room here. Contact Commander Krieg. Tell him we'll transfer the money within the hour. - Mr. President -- - Trust me. Sir, message from Washington. We're to continue our pursuit of the Montana. All other forces are standing down. It's just us, then? Yeah. Let's find them... and kill them. See who it is. It's me. Dugan. - Ugh! - Look out! Get over-- Piersall, you know how to work this? What? How do you work this? I need to shut it down now! - Uh... - Come on. - Try the "off" switch. - Come on, show me. It's pretty easy to turn off, but it'll probably take about four hours to reboot. - Do it. - Uh... You got to be kidding me. Come on. Sir, we've lost the reactor. Auxiliary power is crossing over. - Garrett! - This is Garrett! We're taking on a lot of water here, Captain. We lost the reactor. Get up there, find out what's wrong. I'm on my way. Get this fixed! I'll be back. Captain, I think it's time we started to consider some alternatives. Surrender is not an option, Mr. Allenson. Captain, the diesel engines will keep us moving forward, but at a much slower rate of speed, but more importantly, we can't go into stealth mode without the reactor, and the Floridais close by. We can still defend ourselves. Not without the torpedo room. Contact naval headquarters. We're moving the deadline up. Aye, aye, sir. It's what we're doing. It's what we're doing... moving the deadline up. Got it? Give me your hand. Can you make it, Piersall? - Do I have a choice? - No. Get your weapon. Come on. Conn, reactor room. This is the captain. They've been here and shut down the reactor. And they killed three of my men. Well-- It will take hours to have it running again. Conn, torpedo room. Stand by. Captain, we're still taking on water down here! Can you fix it? I don't know, sir! It doesn't look good! How many are there with you? I got three down here. Okay, pick one, get back here, and seal off the torpedo room. Sir, if I seal this compartment, these people might not get out of here alive. It will serve as incentive. That is all. Aye, aye, sir. Chang, come on! Captain. Washington has agreed to your demands. I'll send instructions as to how we want this done. Mr. President, there's a communication patch for you from the Montana. It's Krieg. Put him on. This is President Taylor. Thank you for taking my call, Mr. President. I can't help but feel... flattered. What can I do for you, Krieg? I am still in charge of this naval submarine, and you will address me as such. And I'm still President of the United States, so let's get to the point, shall we, Krieg? The man was elected for a reason. I understand you're willing to meet my demands. If you mean pay your extortion, then, yes, we are. That's very kind of you, Mr. President. Thank you very much. I feel I owe you this. I want you to know why I'm doing this. At first, I was a little angry about being passed over time and time and time again for command of my own sub, something I richly deserve. Hell, I was gonna be the best captain of the U.S. Navy. I wanted the stature, the respect. But that didn't happen. But now, Mr. President, I am very, very angry. Angry about what? Your policies. Your predecessor's policies. They're all the same-- Negotiating with terrorists when you should be eradicating them. Krieg-- Mr. President, people will want to know what happened here. They'll want to know what went wrong. They'll blame me, of course. By now, you know that I'm dying, and knowing that, you know that for me, it was never about the money. It was always about saving our great country. It was always about saving America. Saving America? Somebody's got to. You're sure as hell not doing it. That is all. People will want to know what happened here. It falls to you, Mr. Allenson, and you, Mr. Gerard, to make it clear. - Aye, aye, sir. - Aye, sir. Mr. Allenson, take these keys, go to the launch control... be ready. But, sir, we got what we wanted. They're sending us the money. I gave you an order, Mr. Allenson. Yes, sir. Mr. Gerard... stand by. Prepare to launch. Yes, sir. Sir, we have sonar contact bearing 309. Range-- just over five miles. Can you identify? Yes, sir. It's the Montana. He's not running stealth. Set battle stations. Battle stations, battle stations. All hands, man your battle stations. Mr. Allenson. Sir. Firing order will be missiles 6, 9, 11, 15, 18, and 21. Aye, aye, sir. Firing order's 6, 9, 11, 15, 18, and 21. Target packages are as follows: Washington, D.C... Pyongyang, North Korea... and Tehran, Iran. Sir, I'm entering target packages. Washington, D.C... Tehran, Iran... Pyongyang, North Korea. I hear doubt in your voice, Mr. Allenson. Sir, I'm just a little confused. Our objective was to ransom the city of Washington, D.C. Nothing changed, Allenson. If we get what we want, all is well. If, however, we are deceived, I will indulge myself in a bit of mass destruction. My God. - Mr. Garrett. - Here. Report to the conn ASAP. On my way. Sonar, range? Sir, target bearing 320. Range-- five miles and closing. Commander Michaels, I need a firing solution. Aye, aye, sir. Noted, target zig. Noted. Man, when this is over, I'm gonna kick your ass, man. You do that. Captain. - Conn, sonar. - Stand by, Mr. Garrett. This is the captain. Sir, I have a contact bearing 285. Range-- three miles, sir. Identify contact. Sir, it's a sub. Sound patterns match the Florida. - Mr. Allenson. - Captain? Begin launch sequence. Captain, there is still time. - I gave you an order. - Captain-- They will destroy us if the sonar shows we're not preparing to launch. Do you understand? Open those launch tubes now. Sir. Beginning launch sequence. Mr. Gerard, send a message to the Florida. Tell them if they do not stand down, we will launch missiles. Aye, aye, sir. Oh, my God. He's gonna launch. Sonar, range? Sir, four miles. Commander, I want that firing solution! I want it now! We're working on it, sir. Message from the Montana, sir. "Unless you stand down, we will launch." Flood torpedo tubes one and two. Aye, aye, sir. Get me a direct line to the President. We're doing everything we can. I've got the Florida on the line, sir. I'll have to call you back. Put him on. Go ahead, Captain. Mr. President, we've located the Montana. We're ready to fire torpedoes. They're threatening to launch unless we stand down. Sir, I need to know what you want us to do. Captain Richards, Krieg is out of his mind, and he's going to launch no matter what. So fire when you're in range, Captain. Yes, sir. Launch tubes are open. Wait here. Clear. You post up here. Anyone comes through, you tag 'em. Uh, Doc, when they do the movie, are we gonna die at the end? Are you crazy? No one kills Denzel Washington. Yeah, I guess you're right. I mean, it's Denzel, man. People aren't gonna stand for that, right? Sonar, range? Three miles and closing, sir. Allenson, how soon to launch? Sir, if we continue, there is no way that we can-- Mr. Allenson, how soon to launch? Three minutes, sir. Initiate launch. Fire missiles 6, 9, 11, 15, 18, and 21. Sir, confirm missiles 6, 9, 11, 15, 18, and 21. - Mr. Gerard. - Sir. Engage. Gerard! Out of bullets, Doc? I'll see you in hell, Doc. Oh, no. Oh, come on. Captain, missile launch from the Montana. Fire one. Fire one. - Fire two. - Fire two. Estimated time to impact? One minute and counting, sir. I need the code, Piersall. I need the code book. Come on. Got it, got it. Four Hotel Foxtrot seven three Kilo Lima Romeo one Delta Quebec nine two Bravo Alpha. Whoo! My man! Doc, we got torpedoes approaching. 500 yards away. Oh, you got to be kidding me. Okay, take the helm. Crash dive. Take her down as steep as she'll go. Launching all countermeasures. This is the USS Montana. Launch aborted. Sub is secured. Commander Krieg is dead. Repeat, sub is secured, launch aborted. Bring her up nice and easy. 10-degree up bubble. Steady as she goes. Blowing ballast. I can reach you there? I'll be here till this is over, General. Good. I appreciate your concern. Absolutely, Mr. President. All right, we'll talk later. The Montana has been secured, sir. Oh, thank God. And the two crew members that were aboard? Alive and well. Well, when they reach land, you just-- You bring them to me, all right? Will do. Admiral Butler. Yes, sir? Good work. And you, sir. Damn good work, if I may say so. Ready to get off this sub? Yeah, of course. Thank you. All right. No. I mean it. Thank you. You're welcome, Doc.
