"Mr. Zombie 2" A disciple of Maoshan? You're smart. People call me Hao Brother. Who are you? Surrender now! You destroyed my plan. I'll fight you! Mr. Zhou, save me! Beat it! Yin and yang, evil ghost, you won't escape this net. Gods above, subdue this demon! Subdue all demons and destroy everything! She's so beautiful. I can't kill her. In fact, me too. Qiu Sheng, Wen Cai, kill that demonic woman. Master, if we three men bully a woman, others will laugh at us. Yes, Master. Look. She's beautiful, too. How about bringing her back and reforming her? You two have been enchanted by her. I'll hit your head... I'll wake you up. I'll hit you... A ghost with resentment? A ghost with resentment! Qiu Sheng, Wen Cai, what are you two doing? Let go of him. Do you know who I am? You're a ghost with resentment. Yes. I'll poke you. -Show your true features. -Qiu Sheng! Wen Cai! -Ghost with resentment, don't go! -Ghost with resentment, don't go! What do you want to do? Don't come over. Don't hurt a woman. Move over. Or I'll hit you as well. -Come on. -Come on. Don't be afraid, miss, I will protect you. Protect me? I will marry the one who defeats him first. Qiu Sheng, Wen Cai, don't believe her demonic words. -Poke... -Stop that. Show your true features! Go away. Hao Brother. Mr. Zhou, your son is inside. What are you looking at? Is she a snake monster? Don't you know? Bring the wood back for us to burn as log. Let's not waste them. You were cheated by the demon -and even beat me. -Master! How dare you say I bully a woman? Master, don't! -Don't go. -Don't! Cai, it's time for dinner. Come eat. Come, come eat. Eat up. I'm starving. I'm starving. I'm starving. -I'm starving. -Fine. I know you're hungry. I'll give you some food later. Look at how fat you are. Can you still fly? Qiu Sheng, what day is it today? I don't know either. You pasted this? Of course not. -Master. -Master. What day is it today? There's a red heart pasted on the calendar today. Oh, no. I almost forgot. Qiu Sheng, Wen Cai, go buy some drinking snacks from the market now. There will be important guests coming tonight. Who? Do I need to report to you? Go buy the food now. Wait a minute, Wen Cai. Let's eat before we go back. -Sure. Good idea. Take my order. -Okay. Boss, I want two steamed buns, two deep-fried dough sticks, and two bowls of soybean milk. Okay. Have a seat. Why aren't they back yet? Are we not bringing food back for Master? No need. He must've eaten already. Miss, look at this. What do you think? Wen Cai, look back. A beautiful girl. Miss, these glasses don't fit your face. It's none of your business. I was just trying to be nice. Miss, it's not very safe for you to go out wrapped in a window gauze. What are you talking about? Miss, you bumped into me, not the other way round. You should apologize to me. You, you two... I'm not afraid of you. Wen Cai, she's so fierce. I'm so afraid. Exactly. She's not accepting our kindness. Let's go. This is not interesting. Let's go home. Let's go. Qiu Sheng. -Qiu Sheng, are you okay? -Yes. I didn't expect her to know Maoshan tricks, too. I don't know why, but we can't let her behave like that. -Let's give her a lesson. -Okay. -Stop right there! -Stop right there! What? You haven't had enough? Show me what you're capable of. Don't touch me! Put me down. I asked them to buy food. Where did they go? Come on. Use your Maoshan tricks. Put me down! Why is it so hot? Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of her. Here comes an old woman. Aunt. What did you say? He said you're an old woman. Kids, watch me give you a lesson. Good job, Aunt! Good job... Don't bully people anymore. It hurts. Sorry. Good job! Rong? Hao Brother? What are you doing? -Master, help us. -Master, help us. Apologize now. Aunt, Dian, we're sorry. It was a misunderstanding. Forget it. Fine. For the sake of Aunt and Uncle Hao, I'll forgive you. Master, you should've told us who the guests are. Then we wouldn't be beat. You deserve it. Dian. Hao Brother, I stayed in Siam for many years. It's normal that they couldn't recognize me and Dian. Plus, it's just a small misunderstanding. -Just let them go. -Okay. You are indeed an old lady who still looks attractive. You're so generous and... What old lady? Copy the Daoist rules 100 times as your punishment. Why? Another question then it's 200 times. What? You're unhappy with that? No, Master. You look very handsome today. But it's so hot today, don't you feel hot in these clothes? Copy it 300 times. I... Here. Help yourselves. Wen Cai, Qiu Sheng, we got to know each other after fighting. I'm generous, so I'll forgive you. I'll finish this, you guys take it slow. Help yourselves. Make yourselves at home. Help yourselves. Let's eat. Sorry. After Dian's dad was killed by a sorcerer, she has been traveling around with me, so once she sees delicious food, she can't control herself. Stop talking. Later on, when the guest comes, you won't be able to eat. Guest? Hao Brother! Qiu? Not bad, Dian. You can tell the fortune? Qiu, what brings you here? Hao Brother, something strange happened in our morgue. The bodies of those who died as a traveler placed in the mortuary became untamable and even collectively moved after hearing the drums outside late last night. I've sent for the corpse controlling Daoist priest to take these corpses back to their hometowns for burying. I'm worried that something will occur again tonight, so please go take a look. Qiu Sheng, Wen Cai, let's go take a look. Hao Brother, I want to go with you. Rong, you just arrived. Just rest with Dian here. Be careful then. Don't worry. Be careful. Don't worry. Remember what I have told you. I've kept it in mind. Master. Master? We'll be back soon. Yes, we're not parting forever. Why are you so unwilling to leave? Qiu Sheng, copy the rules 100 times as punishment. You shouldn't have said that. Master, here you are. Let's go. Hao Brother, let's go. -This way, please. -Okay. Hao Brother, this way. These are the corpses you've mentioned? Yes, Hao Brother. They're still during the day, but at night... Qiu Sheng, Wen Cai, burn joss sticks at the front and back doors. -Okay. -Okay. Why didn't the fingernails grow? There's no vampire teeth either. Master, let's just quickly take a look. Why must we stay at such a horrible place? Stop that. Qiu, hide yourself. Master, did he just move? Qiu Sheng, Wen Cai! Pick up the spells and stick it back on their foreheads. Come back. Come back. Master... help me. Help me. Master. Master. Wen Cai! Tell it to stop hitting me. I didn't make it to. It's not me. More? I know. It's the drums... What should we do next? The drums are controlling the corpses. What should we do, Master? Qiu Sheng, Wen Cai, sorry about this... Dao Brother? Dao Brother, you came at the right moment. Some drumbeats came from the west just now, and these corpses went crazy. This bad? You'd better leave with these corpses from the east tonight. Okay. Qiu Sheng, Wen Cai, stick these spells onto their foreheads. Please make way for the dead. Please make way for the dead. Please make way for the dead. Please make way for the dead... It's finally done. Hao Brother. Given the corpses' strange response to the drumbeats, I worry that the ones inside the coffins... Qiu Sheng, Wen Cai, come with me. You two, open the coffins. One, two, open. Close it up. Master, didn't the Daoist priest take away all the corpses? Why are there three more here? Hao Brother, the bodies in here are locals. Their relatives asked me to find a good place first and bury them some other day. Qiu, don't stay here tonight. Go back to sleep. Qiu Sheng, Wen Cai, we will stay here tonight. Master, there's not even a bed here. How should we sleep? -Yes. -Is there no bed? You can sleep here tonight. -No, that's fine. -No, that's fine. Please make way for the dead. Please make way for the dead. Please make way for the dead. Please make way for the dead. Please make way for... It's not done yet. It's dawn. You must be tired from staying up last night. Go back and rest. These two kids... How dare you? I'll hit you! Wen Cai! Master! -I'll hit you... -Sorry. What a good-for-nothing. I'll hit you. -Master, look over there. -What? Leave now. You. These two kids. Hao Brother! -Good morning, Aunt. -Good morning, Aunt. Are you alright, Hao Brother? Yes. Here, drink some ginseng tea to energize you up. Rong, why do you look so pale? She was too worried to sleep last night. She asked me to cook congee for everyone early in the morning. Rong, sorry to keep you worrying. I'm fine, Hao Brother. You should thank me for cooking. Guests again. -Again? -Again? -Who? -Who? Hao Brother! Hao Brother! Biao Brother? Hao Brother, something bad happened. The corpse-controlling priest died last night. He died? Qiu Sheng, Wen Cai, look around for the corpses with Biao Brother and his men. -Go. -Let's go. -Hurry up. -Search around. Let's go. Judging from the style of the poisonous arrow, this is probably a hidden weapon used by a Siamese. My father was killed by an arrow like this. Fly agaric. Fly agaric? This steamed bun contains fly agaric poison. It is a kind of highly poisonous mushroom which makes people hallucinate. He thought he ate a common plant, but didn't expect it to be fly agaric. That's why he hallucinated with dilated pupils. If I am right, the murderer knew that he would pass by here and ambushed him in advance. He ambushed the Daoist priest with the poisonous arrow after waiting for the fly agaric poison to work. Hao Brother! Hao Brother, we've searched around, but we didn't find any corpse. Yes, Master. We didn't find any either. The corpses must've been taken away already. -Biao Brother, -Yes? please carry the priest's body back to the police station. I'll go home for autopsy tools. Okay. Let's go. Come over. Carry the body back. Come, hurry up. -Let's go. -Let's go. Hurry up. Hao Brother, I went to Siam with our master back then. The local people admired him for his excellent Daoist skills. So some of the sorcerers were envious. One day, Dian's father suffered from their spells. When Master and I arrived at Dian's house... Daoist Priest! My father... Speak! Who are you? Father! Come out. Come out. Ghost! Thank you, Daoist Priest. Daoist Priest! When we looked back at Master, he had already puked out blood and died from the poison. While Dian's father also died from the spell. My mom died early. My father brought me up. He was very honest, so many people liked doing business with him. That's the reason why his competitors envied him. They hired a sorcerer to kill him, to take his business away. If my aunt didn't take me in, I would have nowhere to go. Master, I think the sorcerer is hiding in Qinglong Town. He's probably coming for Aunt. Yes. He even stole the corpses. I really want to know what he is up to. We disciples of Maoshan are always open and just while their sorcery is fatal and tricky. Righteousness and evil are incompatible. Qiu Sheng, take the autopsy tools and come to the police station with me. Is Hao Brother inside? No one's inside. He's still not here yet? You two, guard the door. Don't let anyone in except Hao Brother, got it? Yes, sir. Gou Zai, come with me. This... Go in! Look at you cowards. You've been working for me for so many years, you should be braver. Wake up. Since Hao Brother isn't here yet, let's examine the corpse ourselves first. What's the procedure? I... I've seen Hao Brother do it before. I think we first check whether the nails grew longer, and then... then whether there are any changes to the teeth. It didn't grow longer. I'm here, don't be afraid. I've seen everything since I traveled extensively. Even if the Daoist priest really came to life, will I be afraid of him? -No. -No. Louder! How will you work with me in the future? No. Bro... Biao Brother, he's alive. What's alive? He... he's come to life! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Biao Brother, I don't want to die. What to do? I don't want to die, Biao Brother. I don't want to die. Hao Brother said once, if we hold our breath, it can't sense us. -Help! Open the door! -Open the door! -Help! Open the door! -Open the door! Help. Open the door. What's wrong? Why is it so noisy? The priest's corpse zombified, Hao Brother. Hurry up. Open the door. Yes. Help. Help. Lure him out, Qiu Sheng. Okay! Dao Brother, I had no choice today than to do this to you. Biao Brother, bring the body away and cremate it to prevent more accidents. Okay. Qiu Sheng, send him off, may he reach eternal bliss sooner. Okay. Dao Brother, we're from the same school. You were killed by an evil person. I'll avenge your death. Rest in peace. It was such an emergency, you know? The priest had a green face and ferocious fangs, and he was running after Biao Brother and two policemen. They asked me for help loudly. At such a moment, I, Qiu Sheng, can't just stand there and wait. Then, I rushed to stand before Biao Brother fearlessly, and drew the priest away. Then I used an octagon formation to bring the priest under control. Then he pleaded on his knees, and I finished him smoothly. Master. Master, you really did nothing during the whole process? Of course. Qiu Sheng solved it all by himself. When did you teach him to burn things with spells? Just now. He's agreed to give up pocket money for three years. Right? Yes. Master, teach me too, please. Sure. Be a good boy, and don't ask for pocket money for two years. It will be your tuition fee. Forget it then, Master. If I can't get pocket money for two years, I can't even buy a steamed bun or a deep-fried dough stick when I go out. I should learn some basic skills with Aunt first. Qiu Sheng, learn more skills from your master. Sure. Qiu Sheng, I have a five-year plan. Do you want to learn it? It is enough for me, Master. I've learned enough. Wen Cai, no one could save you if you were hurt by the poisonous arrow. Aunt, why did the dead Daoist priest come to life? I've already checked his corpse. The arrow was full of venomous insects. The priest's body was filled with venomous insects. That's the way sorcerers do things. They use those bugs to control the body. He wasn't zombified. What's the background of the sorcerer? Why does he hate the Daoist priest so much? He doesn't hate the Daoist priest. He just used the Daoist priest's body to make trouble. The one he hates is probably you, Rong. He planned this event to lure us, knowing that disciples of Maoshan won't ignore this. That way, he could find out where you are. Master, where is this sorcerer hiding at? To find him, let Dian use her telepathy skills. An altar. An altar? The sorcerer... The sorcerer? There are more than one sorcerer. There are two of them. Two of them? They're casting spells to the lost corpses. What else do you see? Right. Where are they? Why are you so impatient? Why did you have to ask her when she is telepathizing. We almost found out where they're hiding. Now they're alert. Hao Brother, forget it. Dian, did you see what they look like? I couldn't see them clearly. Aunt, I've tried my best. It consumes a lot of Dian's inner force every time she practices telepathy. And it'll attract ghosts and expose her. Go back and rest, Dian. Qiu Sheng, Wen Cai, guard by the door of Dian's room. Beware of ghosts coming. Okay. Be careful. Here. Rong, I have to go out. I'll come back soon. There are only two stores run by Siamese in Qinglong Town. One sells accessories from Siam. Accessories from Siam are not popular here. So, look, here we are. It closed down soon after opening. Right, the other store is over there. This store sells incense burners, god statues, sacrificial offerings, joss sticks, candles and things like that. Both stores opened not long ago. Hao Brother, you're in doubt that the death of the corpse controlling Daoist priest is related to these two stores? It's too early to make a judgment now. Thank you, Biao Brother. Ask me if you need help in Qinglong Town. Hao Brother, I still have something to do, I'll leave first. Please. Gou Zai, let's go. This way, Biao Brother. Hello. What can I do for you? Hello. I want to buy two quality incense coils. Sure. I'll get them for you now. Boss, here are the best incense coils. Thank you. Boss, I want to buy some joss sticks and candles. Come in, please. Cai, it's time for food. I'm starving. I'm starving. Stop eating. -I'm starving. -Look at how fat you are. -I'm starving. -No food for this meal. -Good morning. -Good morning, Aunt, Uncle Hao. Good morning, Master. Good morning, Aunt. Here is a package for Maoshan Daoist Monastery. I'm starving. Stop talking. Qiu Sheng, it's not for you. It's for Huang Rong. Huang Rong? -Okay, thanks. -Okay, you're welcome. Aunt, this package is for you. This hairpin is so beautiful. Who is it from? A friend of mine in Siam. I didn't expect Shi Tailong to send a gift just days after Aunt left Siam. Shi Tailong? Why is he giving expensive gifts for no reason at all? This Shi Tailong has been courting Aunt for a long time. Don't place such a precious gift here. If it's lost, I have to compensate. When I was in Siam, many people courted me. Among them, some are proactive like him. And this Brother Tailong, is the most proactive and considerate. I like him the most. On the night I came back, the two of us had a candlelight dinner together and he gave me a two-karat engagement ring. I have no idea of the engagement ring. You didn't tell me before. You didn't ask me, of course I wouldn't tell you. I'm getting old, it's lucky to marry someone. I'm planning to go back to Siam and marry Tailong in a few days. Come over. Dian, let me ask you. Is Aunt really going to marry someone? Is there really a person called Shi Tailong? Yes. I can tell you the truth. My aunt doesn't like him at all. I think Aunt is making fun of your master. Well, Qiu Sheng, do you think we should attend the wedding ceremony when Aunt gets married in Siam? Of course. How about this. Let Dian and I also get married at the same time? -Nonsense. -Nonsense. Great, it'll be very lively if we're together. Right, Uncle Hao, will you go with us? Yes. Of course I'll attend Rong's wedding ceremony. I've got a lot to say. I can't think about it anymore. I'm challenged by a rival, I have to say something or I'll lose the chance. I'm ready to risk everything. I was going to give this to you when I propose. -This big? -It's sparkling! Rong, do you still remember the night I left? Rong, please sit. Rong. You'll be going to Siam with Uncle tomorrow. I don't know when I'll see you again, and whether you'll find the one you love in Siam. No, I won't. I'll come back, Hao Brother, because... I like... You like me? Who said so? I like rubies. If I come back, Hao Brother, give me a big ruby necklace. Then I will marry you. Hao Brother! After Rong went away, I've also went faraway to Pyu and Myanmar. I was a miner for three years. I lived outdoors, weathered by the sun and rain. Finally, I've found this lucky ruby, and made it into a necklace. However, Shi Tailong came before me. I am heart broken. I want to give this ruby necklace to you as your dowry. I am so touched. I can't believe, you still remember what I said after so many years. Hao Brother, I won't marry Shi Tailong. I will marry you! Let's enter the bridal chamber now. So soon? Rong, why are you in such a hurry? I've been waiting for you for so many years. Surely I am in a hurry. The bridal chamber right away? Come in. I'm not ready yet, Rong. Go in. Rong! What's going on? Wen Cai, let's play rock-paper-scissors. Who will be the judge? Dian. Sure. What is the stake? Dian. Sure. Come on. -Rock-paper-scissors. -Rock-paper-scissors. -Rock-paper-scissors. Rock... -Rock-paper-scissors. Rock... -Don't go away, Dian. -Don't go away, Dian. -Dian. -Dian. -Dian. -Don't close the door, Dian. -Dian... -We're still tied, Dian. -Exactly. -Open the door now, Dian. We are still tied. Let's continue. Okay. Come on. -Rock-paper-scissors. -Rock-paper-scissors. -Rock-paper-scissors. -Rock-paper-scissors. Let's do best of three. -Rock-paper-scissors. -Rock-paper-scissors. Best of five. Rock-paper-scissors... Wake up, you two. -Rock-paper-scissors. -Rock-paper-scissors. -Rock-paper-scissors. -Rock-paper-scissors. Rock-paper-scissors... You're not done yet? Yes, not yet. Go on then. I'll go do groceries. Don't go. Well, Dian, you've just arrived for a few days, you're still unfamiliar with the place and people here. Let me go with you. Yes. I will go, too. Let's go. Wen Cai, just stay here and look after the house. Let me go. Why should I look after the house? I want to go, too. Let's go buy things separately. Wen Cai, go buy the roast duck that Aunt likes. Qiu Sheng, go buy fish. -What about you? -What about you? I'll go buy vegetables in front. Let's gather here later. -No problem. -Okay. Take care. I want a roast duck, boss. Give me a big and crispy one. No problem. I want a fresh fish, boss. Okay. -Take care. -Thank you. -Here you are. -Okay, thank you. Why are you alone? Where is Dian? I don't know. You came back earlier than me. This girl. She must have gone home on her own. Interesting. I like that. Don't fight with me, Wen Cai. She's definitely mine. You... Stop thinking about her. She's definitely mine. -Dian. -Dian. Dian. Did you come back first? Wen Cai, I'll go check her room. Dian? Dian? Where did she go? Did you find her yet? Not on my side. No? That's strange. Here is your letter, sir. Thank you. Letter? Take a look. Qiu Sheng... What's wrong? This... I... Let's go. Something's bad, Master. Something's bad, Master. Something happened. Come out now. Get up now, Master. Something's bad. Come out, Master. What are they shouting for early in the morning? Don't they know that I... I was exhausted last night? Master! Something's bad! What happened? Dian was kidnapped. Look. To save Dian, Huang Rong must go to Jisheng Apothecary alone. Dian will die if we find others coming with or tailing after Huang Rong to the destination. Dian will also die if Huang Rong doesn't reach the destination in two hours. What should we do, Master? How should we save Dian? Yes! Dian has no one else. Her father died, I'm her only relative left. Hao Brother, Qiu Sheng, Wen Cai, stay here if you want to save her. I can go alone, it'll be fine. Put it on, Rong. Madam, do you know how to get to Jisheng Apothecary? Turn left on the intersection in front. Thank you. Boss. Are you Huang Rong? Boss, we've never met before. How do you know my name? I'm not color-blind. The person who asked me to send you the letter told me the color and style of your clothes. Here you are. If you want to save Dian, take the sedan chair at the end of the street. Qiu Sheng? Wen Cai? Where did they go? We're in the kitchen, Master. What are you doing in the kitchen? -Master. -Master. What are you doing? Can you still recognize us now? Do you think you'll be invisible by making your bodies black? If there is any movement in here, Dian will be in danger after you go out. Unless... What? Tell me now, Master. -Dian's most important. -Yes! Unless you know how to be invisible. Then do you know how, Master? Teach us right now. Sure. Take off your trousers before I teach you. Take off our trousers? Fine. We'll risk everything to save Dian. One, two, three! You're not even a fully-grown man yet. I'll be off to save Dian if I knew how to be invisible. -Master! -Master! How could you lie to us, Master? You lied to us. -Master. -Master. Master. Let's go. Please go in. Okay. One, two, three. Go. Do you see Aunt, Wen Cai? Let me see. I don't see anything in front but roofs. Then look towards the left. I don't see anything on the left but roofs either. What about behind you? Behind me are red roofs. On my right, too, all I see are roofs. Save me! Wen Cai! Are you okay, Wen Cai? I'm badly hurt. You crushed the grass. -It hurts. -Let me help you up. I fell from such a high place. Okay, we've arrived. Please. Dian? Dian? Dian? Aunt. Save me. Dian! Rong! -Rong! -Dian! -Dian! -Rong! -Dian! -Be careful. Rong? Wen Cai. Dian. Dian, are you alright? Here, let me untie you. The antidote, Master. Here. Quick, help me hold her up. I'll carry her. I'll do it. Let's go. Let me carry her. Hurry. Let's go. How did you find me, Hao Brother? We didn't dare to just follow you just now. Dian would be in danger if the kidnapper found us. We arrived in time thanks to Cai. When you left home just now, l asked you to put on the copper bells. Cai will follow you when he hears the sound of the copper bells. When I blow this flute, and Cai hears the sound, he will come back to inform me. Thank you, Cai. This arrow is the same kind used to kill the corpse-controlling Daoist priest. I think they belong to the same sorcerer. Master, what on earth is this sorcery? Back in Tang dynasty, when Tang Monk returned from India with the Buddhist scriptures, he passed by the Tongtian River and crossed the river by riding on the tortoise spirit. The tortoise spirit dove into the riverbed wanting to kill Tang Monk. Part of the scriptures were lost and showed up in Siam. Siam sorcerers found it, and made it the sorcery today. Good sorcerers help catch ghosts and cure diseases. Evil sorcerers deceive people and commit crimes. Master, I heard that there are many different types of sorcery. There is a love sorcery, spirit sorcery, bug-controlling sorcery, sound sorcery, medicine sorcery, spell sorcery, life sorcery, death sorcery, and the flying head sorcery. There are countless varieties. Well then, go to bed early tonight. -Okay. -Okay. Qiu Sheng, Wen Cai, take turns keeping watch tonight. I... Think of something! Help! Go inside, Rong. Help! Dian! Dian! Dian! Be careful, Dian. Be careful, Dian. Hide, Dian. Come on in, quick. What's going on, Hao Brother? I'll go to the living room. Something is strange with that box. Take care of yourself. They're gone. Don't be afraid. Qiu Sheng! Let's go! Let's go back to the room. Okay. Rong, you have bad blood with this Shi Tailong? No. Shi Tailong likes men, instead of women. I guess your enemy is using your friend to retaliate against you. Aunt, did you have any argument with anyone when you were in Siam? When I was in Siam, Master and I didn't argue with anyone and we never made contact with sorcerers, except for that time when Master died. That one time is enough. Master, Aunt, Dian is using telepathy again. Gou Zai, the late-night supper you brought me to tonight -tastes so bad. -That's not true. I've never eaten such bad food before. Biao Brother. Stand still for inspection, you guys in front. Stand still! What? Gou Zai, -stop them. -Yes, sir. Stand still! Stand still! Put your hands up. Gou Zai, go check if they have any weapons with them. Search them! Yes, sir. Why aren't you searching? Let me do it. No wonder you guys stopped! They're coming! Who? Walking zombies. Close the door and get ready to fight. Lower your head, Rong! Qiu Sheng, Wen Cai, the walking zombies are controlled by the sorcerer. I'll set an altar and fight him across the air. Hold on. Don't let them approach the altar. Okay. Be careful, Rong. Okay. Aunt. Qiu Sheng! Qiu Sheng, are you okay? It seems that these two are possessed by ghosts. No, Master is fighting with powers behind. We can't let them approach. -No problem. Let's beat them. -Beat them? They're Aunt and Dian, you dare to beat them? Then let's summon the deity to dispel the ghosts. Okay. -Deities above, I summon you! -Deities above, I summon you! Get up. Get out... Get out of her. Get out. Get out. Get out! Get out! Take my sword. Get out. Get out, ghosts. Get out. Get out. Get out! -Dian. -Qiu Sheng, Wen Cai, why did you beat them so heavily? No, Master, they were possessed by ghosts just now. We had no choice. Otherwise, they won't be dispelled. Enough for now. Help them sit down first. Here. Dian. Dian, are you okay? You've touched my bottom. My face is injured. I won't let you off if no one marries me. I'll marry you if no one does. That's impossible! Master, you looked so cool using your powers to fight the sorcerer through the air just now. Did you defeat him? I killed only one sorcerer. Dian said she saw two sorcerers when she was using her telepathy skills. What about the other one? Dian, what else was near the altar when you were using telepathy? I think, it's a mountain cave. Wen Cai! Wen Cai, let's summon the deity. Okay. -Deities above, I summon you! -Deities above, I summon you! I am the God of Cookery. I am Tang Monk. You're here, too? Go ahead. "Amitabha." Buddy, take a seat, eat and drink something. Harmony brings wealth. Please talk things out, you don't have to fight. Exactly. Wen Cai, why did you summon the God of Cookery? You're blaming me? How about you? It's useless to summon Tang Monk, too. Master, are you alright? When I beat his belly button just now, he had a reaction. His weakness is his belly button. Qiu Sheng, Wen Cai, let's do it together. Okay. Stab his belly button now! Are you okay? The murderer is here, right here! Come. -Right here. -Hao Brother is here, too. -Come on. -Come here. Excuse me, were you using spell powers? Can I arrange an exclusive interview with you for the fight of sorcery versus Maoshan spell powers? I know. I'm my master's agent. Ask me if you have any questions. But will you be paying interview fees? Qiu Sheng, Wen Cai, let's go back. Reporters here, you all must've seen clearly, it was me, Biao Brother who is so strong and killed him with just a few hits. We're now in a new era, what's important is democracy and science. What people say as the almighty sorcery is just the side effect of smoking a kind of foreign tobacco. It stops people from feeling pain. This kind of tobacco is called opium poppy. As to summoning the deity, according to the theory of Dr. Freud in Austria, it's actually a kind of psychological suggestion. Hypnotism, you know? It's called "hypnosis" in English. That's it for today. What I said is... -Let's go. -actually... Let's go. -Let's go back. -Why are you all leaving? Why didn't you stop them? Collect the corpse. This... oh, gosh. Back up. Back up. Stop pushing forward. Back up. Stop pushing forward. -Back up. -Back up. Open up your eyes and search the place carefully. Yes, Biao Brother. Make sure to bring back and confiscate everything valuable. Yes! This Cha Cai really hid things well. He didn't leave anything valuable behind for us. Indeed. How come there's nothing? Another one. It's another poisonous needle. Poisonous needle? They really do work together. People will be punished for their own deeds. It's karma. Hao Brother, it was really dangerous this time. I didn't expect them to follow me here. It's the past now. I'm glad that you're fine. Wen Cai, there is no such thing as modesty in love. I'm your senior fellow apprentice. Dian, the three of us spend every day together, and have gone through thick and thin. Do you like me or Wen Cai? I like you both, but I also hate you both. Whoever gives me a big gemstone like Aunt's, I'll marry him. Okay. I'll set off to Pyu to pan for gold tomorrow! Me too! Let's go. Uncle Hao! Good girl. -Aunt, I'm hungry. -Wen Cai. What are we eating later? My master who is probably over 2,000 years old has so much to say all day long How is it? Are you done copying? Yes. Come see. -Only one copy? -Yes. "Punishment by copying Daoist rules 300 times." That's fine. I have nothing to say. Master, I've finished copying. Really? Good. You really have a literary talent. Copy that for another 299 times. "Copy that... for another... 299 times." Rong, we haven't seen each other for many years. Now that you're back, just live here. If you and Dian need anything, just tell me. Hao Brother, you're my only family here. Sorry for troubling you for a while. Rong, just make yourself at home. If you can trouble me forever, I'll be very happy. Right, I made this quilt years ago. You're finally here to use it. What's this smell? A manly smell. Stop listening. Hao Brother, Rong... Master's in love again. Come on. Great! How dare you eavesdrop on the conversations between Aunt and Uncle Hao! What happened? Uncle Hao, Aunt, they... Wen Cai, how could you eavesdrop on the conversations between Aunt and Master? -You shouldn't do that. -I... Master, Aunt, the food's ready, I came to tell you it's time to eat, let's go. Wen Cai, copy 100 times. I... Here, Rong, let's go.
