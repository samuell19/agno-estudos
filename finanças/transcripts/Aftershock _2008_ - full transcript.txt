[rumbling] [helicopter blades whirring] [boat horn honks] [dramatic music] [players shouting] [dramatic music] [birds chirping] [rumbling] - Log out, Desi. - I always do, Tanya. - Never do, Desi, I always-- - Tanya, is this a major? I've had a big day. - I'm coming, Pete. Let me put this stuff away, PD's policy. Makes it in my review, I won't be a sick. - I'll get your helmet, bit. Grab your jacket and we're out of here. Don't wanna get stuck on the motorway. - Yeah, I just wanna finish this. - Come on, I wanna go. - Yeah. - [Boyfriend] Meet you down at the bike. - All right, babe. - Cleared his policy. Better gonna hand it to you over that piece of work. - Yeah, well, I just gotta get rid of this stuff. - Oh, come away with me. - I need to pee. Get back, always makes me wanna go. - Anyone good for a drink? I'll share, well, first round, I'll share. Going, Louisa? - No, thanks. - Jeff. Tanya. - I'm a bit tied up. - How 'bout you, Sid? - Yeah, maybe, I'm just going for a smoke. Might meet you down there, eh? - Is it my breath? [rumbling] [screaming] - Stop it. Stop it, Michael. - No. - Stop it. - No. - Michael. - Stop it. Michael, take the girls down to the gate. Don't go into the road. Give Daddy a surprise, I bet he's nearly home. - Don't want to. - I thought you might wanna tell him what a good boy you've been, Mikey, before I tell him the truth. Go on. - Is he home yet? Yeah, but is he home yet? Stall him. I've got to get home before he does, Mum. I don't know, send him to the dairy or something. I just need to get home before he does. He'll go bloody ballistic, Mum. I don't know, 15 minutes. [horn honks] - Hey, Alice. - Yeah? - See that thing up there by the tree house? See it? You see its horns. - [Alice] It hasn't got horns. - Has got horns. Look. See its red eyes. [growls] - I'm gonna tell Dad on you. [typing] - Come on, come on, boys and girls, I'm meeting Julie. That legal aide report in the morning, Tanya? - Yes, boss. - I'm locking up, come on, it's way after five. - Jeff, I've got to get my coat and sports bag. Hang on a minute. - Oh. [elevator beeps] [rumbling] [dog barks] [rumbling] [sirens blare] [rumbling] - Shit. [rumbling] [screaming] [rumbling] [electricity sparks] [screaming] [rocks settle] - Are you all right? - [Louisa] What was that? What was that? - Louisa, Louisa, is that you? - Don't move. [rumbling] [screaming] - It's off. [alarm beeps] [dramatic music] [crying] - It's okay, it's okay, you're okay. It's okay, we're okay. - [Man] Louisa, Louisa, is that you? - [Louisa] What was that? What was that? - Must have been a plane, flew into the building. Was it a plane? - It wouldn't be a plane. - It was a bloody earthquake, Louisa. I think it was the big one. - Just stay calm, Desi. - I am fucking calm. - Anyone got their mobile? Has anyone got a phone that's working? - Mine's not working, fucking typical. Jesus. How am I supposed to-- - Pete? Pete? - Okay, listen, roll call. - Roll call, come on, Louisa. - Who's here? - I am. - Pete. - Hang on, Bess. Turn that thing out, there could be gas. - [Bess] Pete, Pete, are you here, Pete? - Okay, quiet everyone. Here's the drill, I'll call your name, and you answer, just answer. Tanya? - I said yes. - [Louisa] Are you okay? - Yes, thanks. - [Bess] We have to get out of here. - [Louisa] Jeff? - I'm fine, just a bit shaken. - [Louisa] Warren? - [Warren] I'm with Tess. I can't move, there's something on my legs. - Stay where you are for now. Desi. - Present, miss. - Anyone else? We need to get together, there's safety in numbers. Muster by the back wall, near the lifts and stairs, okay? That's the strongest part of a building. - We're here, we're here already. - We're by the lifts. [crying] - Yes, okay. Follow the light. - [Man] I can't move. - We interrupt this program to bring you a breaking news story, there has been a major earthquake felt throughout much of New Zealand, but believed to be centered in the Wellington area. We have no contact with our newsroom or reports in Wellington. Landlines are down, cell phone towers are presumed destroyed. We also believe power is out. Stay with us while we find out exactly what has happened. [dramatic music] [dog barks] [dramatic music] - [Woman] Help. [crying] [dramatic music] - I wouldn't do that, mate. There's petrol everywhere. - My old man's gonna kill me. He doesn't know I've got his truck. What am I gonna do, what am I supposed to do, I can't call-- - Forget your bloody tank. There's poor bastards here that are hurt. The whole place could-- - Do you know first aid? What am I supposed to do? - I don't know just check it out. Make 'em comfortable, do your best, all right? - [Woman] Tracy? - Oh, shit. - Is she okay? She's gonna be okay? We're gonna be all right. - [Warren] Help me. - [Louisa] Don't waste your battery. Who is it? - Oh, it's me. I can hear Warren. Warren, it's Tanya. - [Warren] Over here. - I'll see if I can get to him. Oh. I can hear him but I can't see him. - [Warren] Careful, careful. - Is that you? - Yeah. I've got all this stuff over me. There's something across my legs. [grunting] - Louisa's holding a meeting. - Good old Louisa. - Yeah, yeah. She's back there about. - I can't get there. - Can you feel that? - No. - None of us can move in here. Hang on. It's a bit damp, bloody water bottle, but it will do till they get here. - Thanks, Tan. - I've got to go back and see Louisa, I'll be back. - We don't know how many people are able to receive this broadcast. What we do is this, power to Auckland and the north island is fluctuating. We're now broadcasting using our emergency generator. We've managed to get in touch with the backup duty officer from G and S in Wairaki, Rex Hiles, he tells us that an earthquake of 8.2 magnitude with its epicenter in the Cook Straight has been felt from Hamilton to Christchurch. Rex joins us live now from Wairaki. What else can you tell us about this earthquake? - [Rex] Hi, Alex, now this earthquake occurred the Wairarapa fault line. Now to put this in perspective, this has released five times more energy than the Napier earthquake of 1931. That earthquake measure 7.8 on the Richter scale and 256 lost their lives due to that quake. - Rex, thank you. Due to a lack of communication, we're still unable to tell you exactly what damage its caused or if there's any loss of life. We have had some people call in on cell phones from the Picton area and from the Manawatu, but no contact whatsoever from Wellington itself. - [Bess] Pete. Pete. - Warren, he can't move. I'm supposed to be at bloody Nepal trials. [coughs] - With you Warren, soon as. - We shouldn't move him. That's the rule. Wait till they come. - Wait till who comes? - Someone will come, they have to, don't they? Look at this place. They must know, right? - [Louisa] Okay, think. What's the drill? - Don't panic and get the hell out of here. - Unless it's tidal wave. - [Louisa] I knew we should have had practices. - [Desi] What? - A tsunami. - Well, that's all we bloody need. Okay, you're our emergency guide, Louisa. What do we do for tidal waves? - Go up. - Up, up bloody where, Louisa? - Higher and watch your language, Desi. - Higher. There is no up as far as I can see. - So we stay put. - No. I'm going down. Beats sitting around here and hoping. You hear that? [alarm blares] I'll go down and get them up here. Go down the stairs. - Can we all call Pete? - [Group] Pete! - Pete. - Pete! [building creaking] I'm coming down with you. I'll come with you, Desi. - Okay, okay. - I'm too. - We're going down. We'll be back soon as. Someone will. - I'd give you the torch but... - [Bess] Love you, Pete. [grunting] - Oh. - Are you all right? - Knocked me out but I think I'm okay. - You're on coms. - This is Wellington Emergency Management Office, is there anyone there? This is Wellington Emergency Management Office, is there anyone there? - Fire coms, fire coms, this is Wellington Emergency Management Office, Angela Flight, do you copy, okay? - [Man] Fire coms, go ahead, over. - This is the controller. I've just arrived. We're on standby. - [Man] Copy. - This is Wellington Emergency Management Office, does anyone copy? Yes, Mount Victoria. - You and I are it, Janice, and it could be a while. - Slowly, please, Mount Victoria. Can I have a-- - This is Winmo, this is Winmo, Kilbirnie Civil Defense. - Okay, we'll pass it on, thank you. - Kilbirnie Civil Defense, this is Winmo, do you copy, over? - Wellington Emergency Management Office. - Come on. - Can you please repeat that? - Right. - Cory. - Thank you, thank you. - Lory? Can I have a sit back, please. - Kilbirnie civil defense. - Hello, this is Winmo. - Thank you. - Yes. - No, would you repeat that, please? - Just begin to set up the seats. - Thank you, quarry three. - I can't hear you there, sir, can you please just? - How many? - Slow down, UN two. - I understand, are there any appliances? - Right, thank you. - Okay. - Continue. - [Operator] And which roads are that? - [Janice] Can you please repeat that? - I understand. - Okay. - Slowly, slowly, Kilbirnie. - I'll get you back to the kids. - Should I lock the car? - Help me. - Just leave it in there. Someone will move it. - Help. - For how long? - Are you okay? - No. I can't move, help me out of here. - We're gonna free her up. I'll get a bar or something. [dog barks] [water rushing] [child shouting] Come, boy, leave her, come on. - No, no. [screaming] [operators speaking over each other] - Flooding. - Thank you, over. - Thank you for doing this. - [Janice] Thank you, Evans Bay, over. - Copy that, over. - Angela. I've got reports of flooding through Evans Bay. - And Courtney Place. - It's not ordinary flooding, I've got Thorndon, Thorndon says the sea has come right up into the motorway. - That's bloody huge, they've got five dead. - Well, let's do it calmly and then we'll do it well, all right? [operators speaking over each other] - [Operator] Sir, please slow down. - Where's the health rep? - Send out but it hasn't arrived. - Getting reports in there of a tsunami, a wave of six to eight meters, some are saying 10, airports out. Here it comes. - Michael. Michael. Michael. Oh, Michael. Baby. [crying] Michael. [dramatic music] - Looks like we lost that boy. [dog whimpers] Come on, you mongrel. [dramatic music] - And while we still have no direct link, land lines and cell phones are still out. We do have radio phone contact now, from Wellington, our reporter, Garry McLaren. - [Gary] Alex, a massive tsunami has just hit the Wellington region, I'm going to repeat that, there's a huge tsunami and it has just hit the Wellington region. The damage is incredible, waves have come right up into the business district, destroyed-- [static] - Gary? We appear to have lost contact with our reporter in Wellington, as you can see, our communication with the area is tenuous. We'll be back in touch with Gary as soon as we can but just to repeat, a massive tsunami has struck the Wellington area. [rustling] - [Louisa] They won't attempt anything until daylight. Desi and Bess will tell them where we are. - Let's say they didn't get out. let's say they didn't get out and no one knows. - Jeff, it's a bit early to be giving up. We've got 24 hours, maybe 48. We've got time. We're not going anywhere. - [Jeff] So just and wait. - Well, have you got a better idea? - I vote we have someone with Warren all the time. He's, I don't think-- - One thing at a time, people. First thing, stock taking. - [Jeff] Stock taking? - Jeff, I was appointed-- - You volunteered. - Okay. You're the supervisor, you wanna take over, cool, just get your shit together and show some leadership for a change. - [Tanya] Crikey, Louisa. - People lives at risk here. What would you like to do, Jeff? - Carry on, Herr Hitler. - Bloody hey. We take stock. Water, food, warmth. - [Jeff] Light. - There's a bottle at the water cooler half full. - And there'll be water in the toilets, too, if we can get to them. - Drink from the dennies? I'll be gone by the time, what we do when we wanna take a crap? - We'll need to work out what to do with our body waste. - For God's sake, Louisa. - Yeah, given that's what I'm saying. We need to have this system out. [operators speaking over each other] - [Angela] Well that steel's been taken off, we need isolate ourselves from the-- - I'm taking over for Vicky Cotter, she's dead. - I'm very sorry to hear about your colleague health. Now, I need a sit report from you as soon as you can, and that's your station over there, thank you. - I'll need to get out at some point to tell her husband, she was a friend. - Yeah, it'll be taken care of. But now that you're here, you're here, and I need that report as soon as possible. Thanks, hon. Look, if it's too hard for her, would you get a replacement please, because she is no good to us the way that she is now. - Angela, yeah. - Rupert. How's the mayor? - She signed the paperwork, I think. - You think? Are we declaring? - Civil defense emergency. So you're in charge of the city, Angela, and I suspect we're close to a state of national emergency. - Mitch. - All of the centers around the country have activated, it seems they're ready to help, but look, I've got to go, so. - I would want to see-- - Good luck. - Police, fire, roading, housing and health in the control room in 10 minutes and I want an interim overview from each of them, and I want you in there with me. - Sure. [gasping] - Hey, this is my tree. - There's not room enough for both of us, mate, there's only room for me. Cold? - Freezing. - Hang on to Einstein for a bit. He'll warm you up. Mind his back leg, he gets a bit slippy. - Why do you call him Einstein? - He's the brains of the outfit. [dog growls] - I'm doing law. - Yeah? Run by crooks for the crooks. - No. Keeps things honest. Keeps people in order, protects property. - Yeah. Doesn't stop you stealing Daddy's car. - Fuck off. - You finished with that dog, have you? - No. [dog growls] [rumbling] [screaming] - You feel that one before? - Knocked me off my feet. - [Woman] Hey. [sirens blaring] - Desi and Bess have gone to get help. You can hear things down on the road, so it won't be long now. I wish I could do more. [rumbling] [upbeat music] - Kiata, good morning. A summary of what we know 14 hours after the major earthquake that struck Wellington. The earthquake measured 8.2 and occurred at 5:15 PM. The tsunami arrived 13 minutes later. Overnight, a national state of emergency has been declared. Also overnight, aftershocks have continued, the biggest at midnight measured seven in magnitude, and the widespread panic that had occurred earlier in the evening began again. Structural damage to buildings was again extensive, and there are massive landslips throughout the greater Wellington region, blocking key arterial routes, like Ngauraga Gorge and the Hutt motorway. The city is completely cut off. We have managed to establish a satellite link with two crews in Wellington. Here's the first of our live reports from Miriama Kingi in the Newtown area. - This is just one of a number of fires currently raging in inner city suburbs such as Thornton and the outer valley. Where there are larger amounts of older wooden houses. The timing of the quake at 5:15 PM meant that there are lot of gas cookers and heaters in use, and some gas lines exploded. Fire crews can't get around the city, and there have been a lot of situations overnight that I've seen where a fire that has started in one house has destroyed a whole block of houses. Some people have done a great job putting out individual fires, and of course, down by the harbor where the tsunami came through, there have been fewer fires. - I gather that you are virtually trapped in Newtown? - Yes, we certainly didn't feel as though we could move around much last night, but the plan is now to sit out for the downtown area. We'll be on foot. We'll be carrying our portable satellite equipment, so we may take some time. - Thanks, Miriama, and take care. We'll hear back from Miriama when she reaches the CBD. As mentioned, we're still unable to make contact with our reporters in downtown Wellington. Civil defense have requisitioned all helicopters in the lower north island. Apparently, there are a number of buildings that have come down. Many others are extensively damaged. We have got some pictures captured and sent out of the effect of the quake and tsunami. In the greater Wellington area, we have no idea how many people have been killed, injured, or are missing as a result of the original quake, let alone the tsunami, fires, and aftershocks. Estimates though, range from 500 to 1000 dead. [water running] - You're too wound up in yourself. - I've got to get some clothes. - [Man] Your priorities are screwed. Think about the animals at the zoo, they'll have to shoot them, you can't have tigers and shit wondering. - Well, I don't think about that. - [Man] No, I know, it's what I mean, or the boys up in the jail, they'll be shooting them, too. - I don't think so. - You calling me a liar? - No, 'course not. Can I carry Einstein. - Yeah, all right. Where is he? Is that full? - About half. - [Man] You have a motor? - I don't want to lose her in the next shake. Lost the chimney in the last one. - You got a tarp? - [Woman] Yep. - Tell you what, lend me mate and we'll cover the hull, after breakfast. - Where's your mate? - He's a bit shy. Give us a hand. Jeez. Give it a lift. Ready? - [Woman] Took me all morning to tie to the house. - This will do. - Police, how's the CBD? - It's not good. Still lots of the buildings and the streets are very dangerous. There's a lot of flooding, still trying to get a clearer picture of which parts of the city have been worst affected, but we do have good numbers on the ground and our rescue teams out being supported. - Okay, roading. - Yep. - How many gangs have you got out? - Fullton, Hogan, and one gang in the rear. They got another gang headed towards Adelaide Road to clear through the hospital. - Priority? - We need to get all 15 gangs out as soon as possible, clear through the keys, so we can get across town. - [Angela] Motorways? - The over bridges are down. The airports are and so are both tunnels. - Keep me informed next 24 hours are crucial. Okay, housing? How much pressure? - A lot in the south. They're flooding in schools and churches already. - [Angela] Planned for displaced persons accommodation? - Yeah, we're thinking 10,000. - Better make it 20,000 housing. Get started, get cracking. Right, health. Plans for the dead? - We commandeered refrigeration trucks. - No, no. That's gonna take us three, maybe five days before you can even get across town, and I don't think we've got enough refrigerator trucks in the whole of the country. - Mass grave? - Really? - It's not on the plan, but if the numbers keep mounting we might have to consider it. - Okay. Talk to police and coroner's office, and you are to keep this idea quiet. Mitch, I want you to talk to Christine. - And we need more body bags. - Get them. Right, fire, let's talk about new turn of Mount Fick. Let's see if we can get these fires under control. - Well, access is pretty much impossible, and we've got water issues, got none. - Mummy, gonna make it here? - Excuse me, have you seen this man? Excuse me, have you seen this man? His name's Ward, he's my husband. Excuse me, have you seen this man? Have you seen this man? He's names Ward, he's my husband. - I'm sorry. - Okay. Come on, dears. - Now what have you brought with you? - I've got nothing. - [CD] First of all I need you to sign here. - Ellis, Ellis, wait for me. - [Man] We have a doctor. - [PA Announcer] This is a civil defense message. Please make your way-- [baby crying] - How did you know where to find us? - 'Course he'll find us, you know Daddy. - You know, there's a spot over there. - Okay, thank you, come on. - [Woman] You can go over there as well. - [PA Announcer] This is a civil defense message, please stay tuned for further announcements. - Looks like Newtown on fire. - Yeah. - God, the house shook itself like a wet dog. - [Man] What do you do? - Stay put. What do you do? - Just thinking about that. - [Woman] Got a wife? - Suits you. My brother's got a kid. Gave it to his missis. My brother has a dry balls, couldn't give her one, so I said I would. Guess it made us all pretty close. - Good on you. - How'd I get here? - I think he's in shock. Whiskey might help. Let me open that tarp for you. - Can I come in, please? - Come on, come on in, come on. You sit here. - Got it out there, mate? - I was on the motorway. - Us too. Want some food? - Please. - What about a cup of tea? - Thank you. - Here you are. - We're crossing now live to Erin Westin, our reporter who is up on the Kilburnie hill. - Alex, I'm standing overlooking Kilburnie and Lyall Bay. From here, you can back across to what was the airport, and towards Seatoun and Miramar. Now, as you can see, the airport has been severely damaged. That's along with large parts of Lyall Bay, where many of the sea front houses have just virtually vanished. While many of the airport buildings are still standing, air bridges, planes, and vehicles are littered everywhere. It's just a scene of destruction on the ground down there, there are cracks in parts of the runway, and the whole area is covered with sand. Flights have had to be rerouted to Palmerston North. - Erin, you're a Lyall Bay local. Can you tell us how you are holding up? - Alex, it's really quite something to be experiencing an earthquake in your own home town and then covering it like this, also I haven't been able to get close enough to my house to see quite what the level of devastation is, although I know a number of the houses in the street that I live in have been just devastated. The water went right through there, and despite all the water, there's a number of fires that are structures that are unsafe. There are people staggering around in shock. I'm just going to have to go down as soon as I'm allowed into the area to see what the devastation has done to where I live but my family is safe, and that's really all that I'm worried about at this stage. - How bout the other suburbs we can see in the background, Miramar and Seatoun, how are those people faring? - Well, at this stage Seatoun and Miramar are completely cut off and boat access is impossible, and all the boats at marinas like at Evan's Bay, have either been ripped from their moorings and have disappeared or they've been destroyed by the tsunami. Now earlier before we climbed up on this hill, we were down on this side of the Mt. Victoria tunnel, which has collapsed, now as you can see, this one driver has had a miraculous escape. The tunnel is apparently also blocked in at the other end, but we just don't know what the situation is in the middle or how many people are trapped inside. Look, this just couldn't have happened at a worse time, it was rush hour when the earthquake struck, so inevitably, there were a number of people inside the tunnel, but whether they're alive or dead at this stage, we just have no idea. [operators chatting] - [Operator] I haven't got anyone I can release. It's hard enough getting someone across the road, let alone across town. - [Angela] We're just gonna have to re-juggle your resources, because... - I'm from Miramar, heard the reports coming, and it's not looking good out there. - No, it's not, I'm sorry. - [Civilian] There's fire in Miramar. - Yes, there is and in Berhampore, Newtown, CBD, Manco, you will have seen all the reports coming in. It's very hard to take. - You're not sending any appliances over our way? - No. Limited appliances and no access. - My wife, my kids, we live in Tahi Street near the shops. It's a block of flats, three story. You just can't leave them there to die. - I'll sort this. - Look, Tony, don't smidge. Fact, no access. The wave swept across Lyall Bay and the air port, Cobble Drives out for at least two days, probably three. We had three fire appliances destroyed in Kilburnie, which makes a total of eight so far around the city. We don't have the man power. It was a difficult decision to make, but it had to be made. - Do you have family out there? - Did you check your family before you came in here? - I was in town, I came straight here. - Well, here's the first rule, check your family, and if it's any help to you, I didn't check mine either, and I don't have anything to offer you except that we are doing the best that we can. - Had to ask. - Yeah, you did, you did. Look, it's a national emergency now, anyway. Resources should be pouring in. Get me Christine. - [Mitch] You should take a break. - Saying that I'm not managing, Mitch? - You're well past your hours. You'll drop if you don't take a break. I can manage, I've had a break. Take four hours, six if you can. - Christine first. - [Christine] Angela. - Hey. Now there are a couple of what I would call alarm and despondency issues, so when you talk to the media, we have not abandoned Miramar, Seatoun and Berhampore. We are not digging mass graves, and we do not expect the death toll to get above 10,000. - Well, we've got good cooperation so far. - May it last. - The media are on our side at the moment, but realistically, it won't last forever. Television news crews are getting to places that we can't. In a few days, things will change. - I can't see past a few days, few days will suit me fine. Mitch, I'm gonna shut my eyes down below, and you wake me if things get worse, yeah? [phone dials] [phone beeps] - You okay? You okay? You all right, mate? - No. - Tired? - No. - [Boy] Do you wanna lie down, I'll ask the lady. - No, I'm... It's in my car. - There's something wrong with, what was your name? - Badg. - What? - Badger, I'm diabetic. - He's diabetic, you need insulin. - It's in my car on the motorway. - He needs a doctor. - Don't look at me, he needs a lawyer. - No doctor, no insulin, he'll die. - You seen the motorway? We'll never find his car, it's fucking totaled. - We need a chemo shop. Nearest one's Johnsonville, cross country. - We can't walk to Johnson-- - Hey. - Okay. I suppose we could. Where's your car? - Fixed it. [baby crying] - Is Daddy home? - Not yet, not yet. - [Child] Is he going to bring Michael? - Go back to sleep. Okay, go back to sleep. - What are we gonna do? I wanna go home. - Daddy will know what to do. Okay, go back to sleep. I'm awake and watching, okay? [baby crying] - Miriama Kingi has now managed to get from Newtown to downtown Wellington, and Miriama, I understand it's taken you several hours. - Yes, Alex and the scene behind me will give you some idea of why. These buildings in Maginnity Street are still standing, but nearly every single sheet of glass has come out and most of it seems to have fallen onto the street. Under this glass a number of people have literally been cut to ribbons. Rescue services have labeled this one of their no go zones, and I understand that they have no expectation that any one who was on the street at the time could have survived the falling glass. We've been talking to rescue workers. It's another, Mike, go. [rumbling] [glass shatters] - Miriama, as you can see, aftershocks are still being felt throughout the city, and now using our satellite system, we've got some more shots from reporter, Gary McLaren. This footage is of the harbor this morning. The tsunami carried extraordinary amounts of sediment, rendering berths unusable, and effectively closing the harbor to shipping. There's obviously an enormous amount of chemical pollution that we can see throughout the harbor. It's come from the gas and oil reservoirs at Sea View, which have been severely damaged by the quake. Another problem, apparently in downtown Wellington is access to the hospital in Newtown, and even out to the Hutt and Kenepuru hospitals. Some seriously injured people are being carried to the Newtown hospital through the streets. Hutt Hospital has been seriously affected by the tsunami, sweeping up the Hutt River and across, and while Kenepuru Hospital in Porirua is apparently still functioning, access from Wellington and the Hutt is impossible. We also understand that the hospital is swamped with cases from the Porirua basin, and in particular, from Manor, which has virtually disappeared after the tsunami. [operators speaking indistinctly] [rumbling] [man screams] - [Man] Jess. [rumbling] This whole basement gives me the creeps. [dramatic music] [gasping] - Ah, you're dead weight, Benj. Bring me, man. - How do we know that the pharmacy's gonna be open? - We don't. - Or that Johnsonville's gonna be open. - Just gotta put your trust in some things, boy, otherwise you wouldn't get out of bed in the mornings. - Yeah, but do you know if the pharmacy's gonna be open? - No, just like I didn't know I was gonna end up with some pussy who stole his father's car, and leaved it a lady to do the bloody work. Excuse me, take over. I shouldn't have to tell you, boy. [dramatic music] [people murmuring] [dramatic music] [helicopter whirs] [baby crying] - Oh, you can't come in here. This is mine, it's mine. We were here first, I'll shout. - Don't wake the children. You'll be all right, it's over. - What do you know? You know nothing. [baby crying] [helicopter whirring] Have you seen this man? His name is Ward, he's my husband and he didn't come home. - [Man] No, I haven't, sorry. - You see, you know nothing. - What will you do when you find him? - I'll tell him. - What will he do? - He'll hold me. - Would it be helpful if I held you? - No. You're not Ward. - I could still hold you, just for a moment. - What do you want? - Just want to be able to hold someone. - We don't have much water. Are you thirsty? - Water's like gold, can you spare it? I am thirsty. Thank you. [crying] - Hold me. [crying] Oh, he'll be so angry. This is all my fault. He'll blame me, he'll blame me. [crying] - Come on, Badg, I'm relying on you, okay. [fire crackles] [glass clinks] [people murmuring] - Listen, mate, I think you've had an accident in your pants, sorry. I thought I should say-- - Have I? Sorry. - It's not a big deal. Look, I can clean it up for you. Just wanted to let you know. I don't think you should just... It won't be long. - Thanks, Deb. [dramatic music] - Desi and Bess haven't come back yet. Jeff and Louisa are trying to clear a way to the stairs. - You won't leave me, will you? - No. Course I won't. [dramatic music] [grunting] - All right? Take a breather. [knocks] Hello. Anyone here? Is anyone here? - Well, get going. Go on, you'll have to hurry. Go on, you might find a car. - Come on. You gonna be all right? - We'll be fine, just hurry. They'll be back in no time. - Careful, careful. - Help me with this, please. [grunting] - [Louisa] Not safe, Jeff. - It's coming. [rocks fall] Oh, let there be light. [door crashes] [coughing] Come here. [coughing] There's the stairs. [coughing] [metal clangs] [dramatic music] - You're fit. You play league? - No. You? - No. Never found the time. - I dance. - The cha cha cha and shit? - Yeah. - You had to be home. - No. [operators speaking indistinctly] - Right. Police. - We've got reinforcements standing by in Auckland and Christchurch and some in Hastings, but until we get enough transport, we can't get them through. - [Angela] Gotta hold till tomorrow? - Looks like we have to. - Yes, police, it does. Fire, things looking any better? - The appliances we have left are all tied up in the CBD, still can't get through to Berhampore, can't get through to Newtown, still can't get through to, we may have to let older Wellington burn. - Well surely we can get water there somehow. Monsoon buckets. - There's not enough choppers available. - The road gangs are at full stretch. - All right, well come on, peoples, come on, we need ideas, ways of stopping old Wellington from burning. - [Male Reporter] When are the exits gonna be available? - Well, first of all, there's such an enormous amount of human suffering and property destruction. It's unrealistic for us to put any estimate on that yet. - [Female Reporter] Well, you must have some idea of how many people are dead, are we talking hundreds, thousands? 10s of thousands? - I'm sorry, it's just too early to say, and realistically, our priority is with the injured. We would ask that if people are not seriously injured, and they have some food and water supplies, that they remain where they are. Our message to them is that help is on its way. - [Female Reporter] Soon? - Soon. Realistically, for uninjured people, we are hoping that they can survive without help for a few days. [reporters speaking over each other] We have to operate to a seat of priorities. - [Female Reporter] But 24 hours after the earthquake, does anyone have any real handle on the scale of this disaster and what's happening on the rescue front? - Health. - Where do I start? Well, we're still not through to Wellington hospital, yet. Road isn't clear. We have temporary field hospitals, in Korori and Tala operational, and a new one being erected at Massey campus and Mount Cook, it should kick in by tomorrow. - [Angela] Well done. - We desperately need an access road through town, around the harbor. - Come on, roading. - It'll be 24 hours at least. There's nothing I can do. That's all the resources I have. - I'm a virgin. I was gonna drown down there on the motorway, and I could think was that I'd never get to have sex. Know what I mean? - I said your priorities were fucked up. - Let's get that insulin. [dog barks] [glass shatters] Do they know the power's off, little pricks. Chemist. Round the back. [dog barks] [whistles] - Come, come on. - I'm standing on the Wellington side of this barrier, which is on a side road just in from Otaki. All roads leading to Wellington from here and across to Fieldston and the Wairapa have been closed, and check points are being maintained by police with help from the army and the civil defense. No one is getting through. No relatives of people beyond the blockade, no media. Earlier there was an altercation when the gates were opened briefly to allow a family to leave. Emotions are running high with people wanting to enter the zone to find friends and family members. Many of these people, as you can see, are distraught, but the authorities are saying, they just cannot cope with extra people in the zone. There has been some exceptions. People with skills or experience in areas such as earth moving, building, construction, they are being allowed in. They've been rescued to assigned to rescue teams, but if it's found they're on a personal mission, then they're just not being allowed in. [banging] - I can fit through that. - Yeah? - Give us a lift. - Here. [glass shatters] [dog barks] - That was lucky. Shut up, you mongrel. - Who's gonna hear? Don't talk to him like that. [dog barks] [dramatic music] [rummaging] - We'll need hypodermics, too, needles. - I hate needles. Where is the stuff? - Try the fridge. That's where my dad keeps his heart stuff. Yes, got it. We're coming, Badg. [gun fires] [dog barks] [dramatic music] - Angela? Angela? - Sorry, sorry, I was snatching a mo. - Well deserved. You've been on deck for a while now. - What's it like out there? I mean, I say clear this, get that, dig a hole, make it bigger. Build a tent city here, build another one there, and will they do it? I don't know, I suppose they do it. What's it all add up to? We save Wellington? - Well, what could be saved you've saved. Have you been out, have you seen it? - No, no, I'm too much of a coward. I'd rather stay shut away in here. - Well, the relief effort's really stepping up now, and the Aussies, they've promised us a massive amount of support. - You tipping me out of my chair, Rupert? - Don't be silly. You know what the mayor thinks of you. Everyone's in awe. - Yeah, well, there's a very big but in there, but? - We got more resources now, Angela, and it gives you a chance to get the rest you need. - Well, I'll sleep over tonight, and I'll be right as rain tomorrow. - Two days, Angela, we want you to had over to the second controller for two days. - Oh, Rupert, what on earth would I do, please, please. - No, no, two days. Orders of the CEO. [dramatic music] - Jeff, Jeff wake up. - Let him sleep, Louisa. - He's supposed to be the boss, looking after his workers. Look at him. Jeff, look after us. - Leave me alone. - You sorry ass bastard. You curled up there like a little maggot. - [Jeff] What do you want me to do? - Look after us. Take charge, think. - Water. Man, hey, never thought I'd be drinking water out of a toilet. [knocking] Listen. [knocking] It's someone. They're here. We're in here! All together. - [Together] We're in here! [clapping] - Shout again, Jeff. - [Together] We're in here! - [Louisa] Here. - The death toll from the Wellington earthquake rose today when two men were shot after breaking in to a suburban pharmacy. It's believed that the men were searching for drugs, and were shot by a local vigilante, while police say that looting has been rare in the aftermath of the disaster, apparently the vigilante was patrolling the shopping area after an appliance store had been broken into. Police have not yet released the names of the victims. Both were Caucasian males. [engine hums] - Okay, off you get, love. [crowd chattering] - [Woman] That way to registration. - Turn right. - Up that way to registration. - [Guides] Straight that way, straight through there. - Here we go. - [Male Volunteer] Thank you. - Up that way to registration, please. Just up there to registration. - [Mother] We want to go home, there are things-- - Just go that way to registration. [helicopter whirs] - [Male Volunteer] Proceed in a straight through there. Welcome, mate, straight through. To get registered. Walk right there. - [Mother] Just stay with me. - This way, thank you. - We wanna go home. - They want to register you first in medical. - Have you seen? - Sorry. - [Male Volunteer] Keep going, thank you. [helicopter whirs] [children laughing] [dramatic music] [children laughing, shouting] [dramatic music] [crowd speaking indistinctly] [dramatic music] [water running] [dramatic music] - When it's gone, it's gone. - I've always said, when we finish the biscuits. It's getting smelly in here. - What about Warren's cup? - [Louisa] He's dead. - Can't be sure, Louisa. Fair shares, come on. [dramatic music] - [Louisa] That's the last of it. - What about Jeff? - Sneaked off. I'm gonna fight that bastard's attunement bonus. You and me, Tan, we carried them all the way. [laughing] - Behind me is a sight I think most New Zealanders associate with third world countries. In this undisclosed location, very close to central Wellington, a mass grave has been dug. A lack of power and even diesel has meant the initial decision to fly in refrigerated containers wasn't feasible. Fear of disease has resulted in this mass burial site. Authorities are refusing at this stage to say how many will be buried here, but it's our understanding that it will be at least 1000. This site was chosen because it's well above the water table. Around two thirds of the bodies being buried here have been identified, but of course, relatives aren't able to attend their burials because movement in and around the Wellington region has been severely restricted. A number of dental experts and the police are involved with bagging and storing personal effects, including jewelry. Where a body has not been identified, it's photographed and then a toe tag placed upon it, so that it can be ID'd later if it's exhumed in a year or so. - I want to go home. - [Worker] Home's where, you're from? - Lyall Bay. - I'm sorry. - Why? - I know that Lyall Bay had a terrible time. - We were there, you can't know. - Well, I'd like to know. Can you tell me? - The children were outside. I'd sent them out. Go and tell your father. The water came and I can't... I wanna go home. There are things. There are things I have to do. - Lyall Bay is a restricted area. It's closed off, I'm sorry. - I just wanna go home. - Look, I really need to get some details from here. Can you give me your full name? Have you got any ID on you? All right, well, what's your name, love? - I'm Joe. - Joe, okay, good. What about you? - Alice. - [Angela] Alice, all right, Alice who?. - Alice Nelder. - Alice Nelder, all right, and Alice and Joe Nelda. That's a good start. Thank you. [gasping] [rocks falling] [metal clangs] [grunting] - You know, they're always saying, all hopes of finding most survivors are when someone shouts. That's a miracle, and then dig you out with their bare hands, and you smile and give a wave. That'll be you and me. You smile and I'll wave, eh? [dramatic music] Yeah. I know you're dead. It helps to talk. [dramatic music] Put your cup over here. Warren. I'll borrow back my jacket, if you don't mind. [dramatic music] [crying] - [Reporter] We are live now with the press conference being held by Wellington city CEO Rupert Stalker, and the WEMO media liaison officer, Christine Fox-Duggan. - Afternoon everybody. Questions? [reporters shouting] - Yes, Christine? Can you tell us what's the situation with communications in and out of Wellington at the moment? - Over half the city now has cell phone coverage, and there are isolated spots where landlines are working, but there is still no power to the city at all. - Christine, Christine, any estimate of when the power will be restored? - We hope to begin getting power in soon, but to be realistic, the supply will be erratic for months. - What about water and waste? - We are getting some water in, and we will be beginning to pipe water from outside into low lying collection points, but those in higher areas will have to come down a bit to collect it. - So is waste a concern in terms of disease? - Yes, but we are addressing that and it will be part of the council's plans for what happens with Wellington over the 12 months. - 12 months? - There are a number of high level discussions going on right now as to whether it is feasible to rebuild Wellington as it was before this event occurred. - [Crowd] What, what does that mean? - Please. Please, these discussions will take some time and we need people to be realistic about this. However people should know that we're doing everything we can on the ground to help them. - In downtown Wellington, search and rescue teams are still recovering bodies. Seven days after the quake, some dangerous no go areas like this one, are now being searched thoroughly. It's a mostly painstaking and depressing job, but amazingly, as well as bodies, there are still people being found alive. This pocket of survivors were found in the Ocam tower on Magginity Street, a building too severely damaged to allow floor by floor searches. The alarm was raised when a white flag was seen jutting from the debris on the fifth floor. Dogs and ab sailors have been used to recover at least four bodies, and three survivors from the building. [dramatic music] - We had that shake the other day, four point something, bloody flea bite. The big one was 8.2. I just went petrified. I couldn't move, I couldn't breathe. Stiff as an ironing board in the middle of, it all came back. When I was in there, I didn't think about family. Blocked them out. Worry can kill you, I believe that. Thinking of moving to Aussie. They don't get them there. Thinking about it. She can be a rough little country, this one. All my work mates, Warren, Louisa, bloody Desi, Bess, but Jeff, he was the one, Jeff saved me. Jeff saved me with that bloody flag of his. But why me? Why did I make it? I still don't know. - I cleaned out the freezer. Had to, there's no power, had to eat the food. I cooked a turkey on the open fire. The chimney came down and the water tank shifted. Two men came out of the bush, they'd been washed up by the tsunami, from the motorway. Took the clothes clear off their back. I couldn't see the motorway, but they told me it was totaled. Fucking totaled, Frank said. We were friends there for a while. Sorry, some of it's private. You don't know a bricky, do you, who could fix my chimney? God, they're like hen's teeth now. - I found Mikey by the tree house, and I buried him down there. When they came to take the other dead people in the area, I didn't tell them. He was mine. - I had my insurance filed within the month. They said, "Get it in, we'll look after it." So I did. The assessor came out, paid the money so we can rebuild, but Zoe doesn't want to leave Michael, and I'm not living down by the sea. I don't trust it anymore. We're in bloody limbo. I just want things back how they were. - But they won't be. People ask us how we manage. Well, you're here, aren't you? What choice have you got? - Can't do this. - Well, I loved Wellington before the biggie, and I still love Wellington, I always have. It's a love affair, you don't always know why, you just do. I love the way that people walk up cube street in their bare feet and sandals, and I love the mix of the hills and the houses. Whenever I was away, I couldn't wait to get back again. It's a bit of a crappy landing, but you know, home. I've always thought of it as our city. Our city, that was small enough but big enough, and it was our houses and our hills. But it's like it's been hurt. It's been, we all lost friends. We all lost property. Lovely big old wooden government building and old St. Paul's and it's not much. We thought that it wouldn't happen here. Happened before, though, 1855, and we rebuilt, stronger, bigger, taller, but I do think it was a terrible mistake to move government to Auckland. - I've been with the council now for 10 years, so when they asked me what I thought, I said yeah, sure, we can do it. Nice place, really. Actually, it's quite peaceful up here. Those we could identify, we did. Through dental records, next of kin, jewelry, DNA records, and that'll continue when they're exhumed. People ask me how many. I look at it like this. Those people were family and friends of all of us. You can't put a number on fam or friends or their kids. We're just looking after them until they're given their final resting place. It's been an honor really. [dramatic music] [rain falling] [upbeat music]
