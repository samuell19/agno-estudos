Mr. Stern. Mr. Stern...? Mr. Stern, I'm Faye Williams. We spoke on the phone. Are you from the barber college? I'm researching a book about the diorama killings. Mind if I set up here? Uh, yeah. I'll make some space. Uh, can I get you a soda or anything? No, thank you. Big martial arts fan? Uh, yeah. Um... I used to watch a lot of Chuck Norris movies. Um, I didn't really watch his television shows, but I've read his books too... Except for one. But... not so much anymore. Did you talk to anyone else yet? Agent Torres is on assignment. She sent me her deposition. Tried talking to Krissy, but wasn't much help. How's she doin'? Physically she seems well. Uh, so how does this work? Just start from the beginning. The beginning. It's kinda hard to remember the beginning. The end kinda overshadows everything. When did you first know the murder spree was moving through your county? We didn't. I mean, seemed like everything was movin' east. It's not like it was a direct line through Clay. Law enforcement in all the areas were keepin' a lookout. Nobody wanted that in their patch. Due to the sexual nature of the murders? The staging? No. Because nobody wanted anybody they knew to end up dead. Even though it seemed like he was killing people who deserved it. "Deserved it"? You know what I mean. It's not like it was a slaughter of the innocents. It was hookers, child molesters, you know, deviants. We're a godfearing people, ma'am. We know what sinning is and we recognize justice. When did you call in the FBI? We didn't. They just showed up. Made a bunch of noise, but nothin' happened. They headed up north. Except for agent Torres. She stayed behind? She came back. She had a hunch the diorama killer was still in my county. She was very intuitive. Though at that point, we still had no idea. And that's when it started? For us, yeah. I guess it all really started with a couple on honeymoon in a red ragtop caddy. ♪ Wish I was a mole in the ground ♪ ♪ wish I was a mole in the ground ♪ ♪ I was a mole in the ground ♪ ♪ I'd root that mountain down ♪ ♪ wish I was a mole in the ground... ♪ Come on, that was a classic. That was one of my favorite songs in the whole wide world when I was a kid. What? When? When would you have ever heard that song as a kid? When I would go visit my grandmama and she would sing it to me. Why do you act like I don't know anything? I know a lot of things from out here. A lot, a lot. Oh, I know you do. Where the hell are we? Haven't seen a house in forever. It's kinda spooky. I would say in my expert opinion, we're about five hours away, which is, uh, 20 minutes since the last time you asked me. Smarty pants. ♪ Tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise ♪ ♪ oh, they tell me of an unclouded day ♪ ♪ oh, they tell me of a home ♪ ♪ where my friends have gone ♪ ♪ tell me of a land far away ♪ ♪ where the tree of life in eternal bloom ♪ ♪ sheds its fragrance through the unclouded day ♪ ♪ oh, they tell me ♪ of an uncloudy ♪ day. We blew a tire. Well, get out there and fix it before we die from the elements out here in the middle of frickin' nowhere. "The elements"? "Lions and tigers and bears. Oh, my." Well, the good thing is that most cars have things in the trunk for these sort of situations. Ooh. Pull the trunk lever, baby. Where is it in this car? Okay, okay. I find. I find. Rude. You know, if any horror-movie shit comes out of these woods, you better lead it away from the car. We're like sitting ducks out here for roaming bands of redneck cannibals. And horseflies. Did I ever tell you when we were at that training camp I totally saw a ufo? Wha-aa! Why would you scare me like that? Wasn't trying to. You promised me you wouldn't do that anymore. Did you find anything in the trunk? Nope. Nothing but a dead body. Looks like we're walkin'. Yeah, that's funny. What? I don't wanna go walk out into the wilderness. We've got shelter and rations right here. I mean, it's only one piece, but it's long-lasting flavor, though. Doesn't make sense for us to wait. No telling how long it's gonna take for somebody else to drive by. Mm, we could always make use of this big old back seat. Chewing my half. You'll just have to come get it, then. Mm. All right, we gotta go. Yes. We been walking forever. I bet you the only house we'll even find out here will be a cannibal's kill shack. Don't worry. I've got my knife. Do you think there's wolves? Like werewolves? I don't know about wolves. Coyotes, maybe. Well, those skinny little things will eat you. Ow! Tell me about the "swung" murders. We got a call. Another diorama. Right where agent Torres said it'd be. Wife swappers this time. Looked like our guy gate-crashed the party and did some preaching on morals. So Torres was right. Like I said, intuitive. - Hey. - What? Hey, I was almost asleep. Look what we got here. What, this? This a driveway? It's more like a hillbilly landing strip. Hmm. You look like someone who owes me a ride. No! Let's walk. Huh. We come in peace! Hi. Our tire hit a nail. I'm not a mechanic. Just need to borrow basic tools. You got a Jack? No, um... It's broken. Um, could we just... Just use your phone? Maybe to call a tow? Look, my girl here... My wife... Is afraid we might get eaten. By cannonballs. - Cannibals. - Canni-balls. Where exactly did your car break down? Uh, about a mile from here at the fork. Ah. Bet you don't get too many guests around here. It's not fair. You come bustin' in when my balls are hanging out. I'm gonna go put my jeans on, you know? And, uh, you can get comfortable. Sit down. Just don't touch anything. We good? So... do you want me to call you a tow truck? Uh... We failed to introduce ourselves. I'm Jeff and this here is my wife Krissy. Yeah. Uh, Emery Reed. Yeah. My phone is in the other room. I'm gonna go in there and call you a tow truck. And I want you just to sit right here. Don't touch anything. Does your delorean have a Jack? It's not mine. Now either you want me to call you a tow truck, or y'all can get the hell outta here. Your call. Tow truck would be real nice, Emery. Whose is it? Does it go back in time? I have some stuff I would redo. I bet you would. Yeah, the world's full of 'em. Thanks, Tonya. Should be a truck here in a little while. Actually, it might take 'em a couple hours. Y'all want a cup of coffee or tea? Coffee would be nice, Emery. The FBI suspected that Elam Gill was the first victim. Why? The murder scenes were very different. Gill wasn't as obviously staged. Gill wasn't a nice man. He used the children of sunshine to feed his perversion. Little kids. All the victims shared some level of sexual deviance. Agent Torres had a theory that all those perversions led back to Gill, that the killer was trying to cleanse the world of any people like him, and then tell the world why he was doing it. He was refining his skill as he went along. Was there any hard evidence? Yeah, in every scene there was. But that wasn't leading us to who was doing it. We were playing catch-up. Couldn't get a break. And that was at the swung murder? Yes and no. Police work, it isn't always about followin' a trail of clues in a perfect line. Sometimes you have to follow the wrong thing to move in the right direction. I don't follow. It confirmed there was a why to the killings. And if you have a why, it allows you to find out who might be next. Ah. So you live here all alone? We're on our honeymoon. Just married. So you're newlyweds, huh? Yeah, newlyweds. I know. Will we last? You are young. Age, experience, not mutually exclusive. We've seen things. Bet you seen some things. You drive that big rig outside? So I can put food in the pantry. And thank god. In times like these. So what do you do to support your wife, Jeff? We support each other. Jeff's a brilliant artist. What do you do? Are you a painter or a sculptor? Free form-ish. How long have you two been together? Forever. Right, honey? We're soulmates. It was love at first sight. Everlasting love. Fuck. You folks caught me on a bad, bad day. I've got a lot of work to do. Huh. That's interesting. No rest for the wicked. Excuse me. No tow truck yet? Instead of just standing there and gawking at me, you wanna help me? Doesn't look like a man cave to me. Is that your wife and your kid in the photo? - Yeah. - Where are they? Do you, uh... Are you into that, uh... Into that fairy... Fairy thing? I'm flattered, Emery. I mean, like, fairytale stuff. Like, a soulmate. I have beliefs. I believe in... Connection. I believe in destiny. I believe in justice. Destiny. Another belief. See, everybody has to have a belief. Love... Love is hard work. Sometimes even that is, uh... Did you and your wife get a divorce? Life's more complicated than that. It's not just about paper. Is your wife snoopy like you? Worse. Mm. Hmm. Hmm. Mind if I use your phone? Sure. Jeff, can you come here a second? What is it, baby? Jeff, watch out! So we knew our guy was killing people he thought deserved it... Sexual sinners, people who offended his moral righteousness. So we get a call from the truck stop. They found some blood. Agent Torres believed that the blood was human blood, reckoned that it was fresh. So maybe our guy abducted somebody. So we started thinking. Who hangs out at truck stops? Lot lizards. A what? A "lot lizard." A hooker. Hangs out at bars and truck stops. Plies her trade in the back of semi trucks. So our guy comes across a lot lizard. He's offended by that, right? So he takes her, kills her, I don't know. Something. But the point is that he needs to set up a diorama. He's got a hooker. What else does he need? Trucker who sleeps with lot lizards. Do you know how many truck stops there are in Clay county? 37. So we start working our way down the list, looking for anything out of the ordinary. Still a needle in the haystack. It was a long day. But the blood was only a few hours old, and that was the closest anybody'd ever been. - Webber. - Sheriff. We want to ask you a few questions about your morning clientele. I wasn't here this morning. Uncle bones was. Is he coming back in later today? Bones stepped out for an hour or so. Why don't you guys go over there and make yourself comfortable? He'll be back. Stay out of trouble, will ya? What am I gonna do? Emery, where's my wife? Okay, just take it easy. Just calm down. What did you do with my wife, Emery? She's fine. What did you to her, Emery? What did you do to my wife? Now just calm down. Don't do that. - What did you do... - Just take it easy, all right? She's in the car, all right? She's in the car. I just want you to calm down, okay? You know, I'm just tryin' to do a simple thing. I wanna put a dog on its back. A dog I love. You know, I mean, a good dog. Not a bad dog. Bad dog, you just put down. You know what I mean? I do understand. Hey, Emery, why don't you be a champ and hand me one of those malt balls over there? Hmm. Mm. That's good. That was a kind thing to do, Emery. Okay, enough of this. Emery, I need to see my wife. I have made a commitment. Don't you understand? I've made a commitment to my wife. Now, you might not understand what that word means... What did you say? You have the audacity to come into my house and put your dirty shoes on my fuckin' coffee table and say I don't have a commitment. You wanna see my commitment? I'll show you my commitment. I'll show you my commitment. This is my wife Brenda. She screws around. She got no feeling from the waist down. And she screws around on me. I got a bitch in the bathroom back there that was screwing her. I saw them. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna put you and that wife of yours in that bathroom with him. What were you doing wasting all that time with this idiot, huh? Krissy. Baby? Ow! - Did he do anything to you? - He doubted our love. It's okay, sweetheart. Well, I'll be darned. Our day couldn't get any weirder. Gotta say, Emery, you have thrown me for a loop. I am thoroughly intrigued. We've never seen anything like this before, have we, honey? In all our time on this glorious mission. No, we have not. I'm starving. Here's what I wanna know. How did you two meet? I was in high school, and he had a truck. Thank you. Have you always been handicapped? No. No. Thank god. Your legs look fine to me. I'm paralyzed. So you can't feel anything? Mm. What do we do now? Oh, my god! Not even a tickle. Mm. Don't like her very much right now, do you? Teach her a lesson, baby. Okay. Old man, get. Why? 'Cause I want you to know how your beautiful wife feels. That's why. I wanna check out the bitch in the bathtub. Nice. I'm gonna go hang with the cripple. Did you know this man? Tell me how it went down. It was early in the morning. I was supposed to haul a load of plastics to Chicago... But my boss dropped the contract, so I was free to go home. Surprise the wife. Oh, my god! What have you done? Oh, god. Oh, my god. Why are you even here? Oh, my god. You were our fuckin' therapist. You sick fuck. Your therapist? Well, not so bad. It was all just an accident. If you explain it to the guy, he's a doctor. He's used to dealing with crazy people. I'm sure he'll get over it. Hey, bitch, it's all just a misunderstanding. Why don't you let bygones be bygones, you know? You and Emery. Hug it out. Excuse me? What was that, gory man? What an asshole. But he is dead. Tsst-tsst-tsst. The blood sprayed out, white pillowcases over their heads to cover their filthy faces. And then we marked them so people wouldn't be confused as to why we offed them. There's a passage in the Bible that sums it up pretty well. It's better to hang a millstone around your neck and be cast into the ocean than to offend one of these little ones. You do degrading, deviant sexual things to people who are just begging to be loved... Little kids, you deserve to fucking die. Yes. Yes, i... I hear you. You're right. I... Krissy, I can see that you've had a really hard life, and you need help, and if you let me, I can help you. Help? You wanna... You wanna help me? No. You're the one that's gonna need help today, Brenda. Oh, man. Now I gotta piss. Thing is, my friend, I don't think this was an accident. I think you killed this man because you wanted to. Because you needed to. Because you enjoyed the act of it. Because you were flexing your power. Yeah? So which one is it? A, b, c, or d? All the above? I can see that you are a good girl. I see it. You remind me of me when I was your age. Please, don't let a deranged man ruin... Don't you even understand? Or do you just buy right into this whole idea of what's right and what's wrong? First point, you are a whore. Second point, you say you love your husband, which makes you a liar. Mm. What's this? Another couple killed off the interstate. Was it you? Or was it...? Ah. You don't look the part, Jeff. What the fuck's this country coming to? I know, right? And yet you think that I'm the one that needs help. "Help" is a dirty, ugly word. I remind you of yourself? Jeff loves me. He heals me with his love. God, it must be so easy for you. In this society where adultery is tolerated. Where... where drug dealers and pimps and... and whores are celebrated by the media. At least we're doing something about it. You ladies having fun? Not really. Brenda's boring me. She doesn't have a clue. She's just a whore. Oh, Brenda. Brenda, Brenda, Brenda. Emery just showed me the remains of your chopped-up lover in the bathtub. How's that make you feel? God, please, just... You two like art? You wanna be art? Nobody cares about you. Whole fuckin' world doesn't give a fuck about two demented people, just running around doin' all kinds of shit and killin' people, and... fuck. Shut the fuck up! You can't even keep your wife satisfied. You push her to cheat on you. That does not excuse you. I say we kill her. We kill her first and we mark her down as "slut." And Emery... Mark him down as "cuckold." No. No, no, no, no, no. I wanna hear the whole story first. Talk to me, Brenda. When did Emery stop having sex with you? After the accident. Brenda. Emery must have been a leg man. You watch a lot of porn, Emery? No. That's a lie. Hmm. Another juicy piece of information. I wanna hear about the kid. No. I don't want you to talk about my son. Kurt. You never wanna talk about him. You just wanna pretend he never happened. Just let it out, Brenda. Talk about it. It was just really bad luck. - No. - What happened? We were driving to football practice on a Saturday morning, and a drunk driver hit us. He was just 13. Emery wasn't here. Emery was out on the road. I was on the road. Okay, okay, and then he dies. Ah. So what? Then he stopped touching her? If you had made any effort at our marriage counseling, we could have had a shot at this. Oh, and maybe... Maybe he would fuck me too. Fuck you. All right, that's enough. Why don't you just fucking kill me? Krissy, tape this fool up. Finally. Show them what they've been missing. But there are very few Hannibal Lecters in real life, so when a case as sensational as this hits the airwaves, every crime unit across the country sends in their unsolved. Half the time, we're just weeding through. It's a frustrating process dealing with media, local law enforcement, and their ridiculous theories. No offense. But there are specifics you begin to spot. Without seeing a face, you get to know your killer personally. - Like a lover. - Yeah. I guess you could draw that comparison. You see, I reckon that this guy and this guy are one and the same. There's a consistency in the weapon used. The deep puncture to the neck. Same murder technique. Same weapon. Yeah, but what confuses me about the truck stop is that the spray is wider, possibly created by a different weapon. Couple slain by diorama killer. And we still don't know for sure if it's the same guy, 'cause a perp doesn't usually change his pattern so radically. Not unless he's afraid of being caught. But from disorder to this kinda structured thing? Maybe he fell in love. With another killer, explaining the female DNA at all the murder sites. Love forms that miracle every day. You all lookin' for me? Bones? That's what they call me. We've got this suspected homicide down by the truck stop. Actually, we have maybe more than one homicide. Sir, were there any truckers in here this morning? Honey, there's truckers in here every morning. Yeah, but anybody out of the ordinary? Well... There was one. Hank Zimms. What's so special about Hank Zimms? Sheriff? What's so special about Hank? He was the perfect victim. He was a degenerate, a lowlife. It didn't get worse than Hank. He'd been arrested for drugs, petty crime, slept with hookers. But... He was also the worst tow truck driver in Clay county. So find Hank and... We might be onto something. Cool. You guys gave your kids toys. Huh. Good parents give their kids toys. I know you won't believe me, but... I don't look at porn. It was Kurt's. I didn't want you to find it. Why didn't you just throw it out? They were my son's. ♪ I... ♪ Reside ♪ where good and evil ♪ collide ♪ virtue ebb and flowing ♪ with the tides... ♪ Logic falling prey... Oh, shit. Babe. Huh? Huh? Here, fucking shoot him. No. No, go get Brenda. Brenda...? Hmm. You gonna come in nicely? Got her! - Who's that? - Help! Help us! Keep yelling, and I'll kill whoever's out there. It's my buddy. He's a cop. He comes by to visit. If you let us go, you get out the back door, you can get away in the woods. Answer it. Tonya? Dad, I told you to shut up! You looking for Hank? He's been out with the tow truck all mornin'. God bless America. Who are you? I'm, uh, Hank Zimms. Hanky-panky towing. Emery called. Is everything all right in here? I heard some yellin'. Yeah, no, everything's fine. Um, I was just... I'm a massage and physical therapist. Nudastic massage. I, um, I help Brenda with her condition and Emery too. Um, yeah, it was actually my car that broke down, so I'm just gonna go put my shoes on and I'll be right back, okay? - Sure. - Okay. You looking for Hank, he been out all morning with the tow truck. Call all the way out on I-84. So he's working? I told you, Emery called Hank and asked him to bring out the tow truck, so that's where Hank be heading. So can we get his address please? I don't know it. You got a warrant? Tonya, he's not in any trouble. We just need to talk to him. I don't know if I want her talking to Hank, Ricky. Unless maybe we're doing a man swap. You can have my pig of a husband and I'll tuck in with Ricky here. - Look, ma'am... - Tonya... I'd consider it a personal favor if you'd get the address for us. Who is it? The tow truck. You really call the tow truck? I'll be damned, Emery. All right, you need to go with him, get our tire changed, come right back. Why do I have to go with him? Because I said so. You're treating me like an annoying little kid right now. And? And will you just admit that you're being bossy? Yeah, I'll admit that. But you still need to go get our tire changed and bring the car back. Don't let him get suspicious either. Fine. I'm gonna go with him and get the car because that's what I wanna do. Okay. What do we do? We don't. Thank you. For what? For trying to save my life. So you got a caddy? Yep. I got a hemi in here. I can hook it up to just about anything and make it move. It's a big hemi. So what you're saying is it's the size of the hemi that matters? Uh, yeah, I guess I am. But isn't it really more about how you use it? I mean, I don't really know how... how it works. Most boys don't. Well, thank you. Thank you for the tow truck, Emery. He's a real catch. He deserves a reward. Something like... A faithful wife. Shame on you. You will never go hungry with this man. Emery's address. I found it just for you. If you throw him in jail, don't call to tell me. You just come 'round here in person. Ugh. This tire's getting me all grimy. Let me get it. You know, I don't mind gettin' a little dirty, if you know what I mean. So, um, that's the Jack, and then, uh, what's that other thing do again? The Jack is for gettin' it up. And the wrench is for playing with nuts. Now, you seem kinda like a hands-on girl. Right now... I don't think your wife would really like hearing that. My wife is a cow. And she knows I'm a pig. You're as hot a goat in a pepper patch. You sure know how to talk to a lady. Um, i... oops. My hands are all dirty. Uh, you know, I have some baby wipes in the car. Would you mind getting them for me, please? I don't mind a little dirt. Oh, yeah, but I wanna be clean just for you. Please? Pretty please? That's sweet. I like that. That is sweet. In the front? Where are they? Oh, they're, uh, they're in there. I don't see 'em. Oh, well, they're... They're just a little bit deeper in the front there. Are they under the seat? Are they in the glove compartment, maybe? No. Did you let your marriage counselor kiss you? No. Did you let him put it in your mouth? No. Leave her alone. That all you got, Emery? You feel that? What about that? How do you want it, baby? Looks like I found the only place open for business. Leave her the fuck alone. It appears that all your wife needed was a good banging. Leave her the fuck alone, Jeff! I'll fuckin' kill you! I love you, Emery. How do you feel about this, Emery, huh? I'm sorry. Honey. I'm home. Hey, baby. Look. What? What is it? What did you do? Tell me there's still blood left in the hooker and he didn't notice. He didn't notice. But I may have kind of... Just a little bit killed him. You are so impulsive. If you don't watch it, you're gonna get us caught. It's not like I left him lying in the middle of the road. I put him in the car. And the truck? What about the truck? What about the truck? No one'll notice. They'll think it just broke down. What a lot of people don't know about Chuck Norris is that he was actually trained by Bruce Lee. He hangs out with, like, Buddhists and all sorts of different people like that. He's a lot deeper than people give him credit for. Uh-huh. Huh. If Zimms is anything like his wife, I kinda doubt he's gonna be much help. Hank is definitely not the sharpest tool in the shed. I feel like I been sucked into the land of deliverance. Krissy. Krissy, stop. I'm not chasing you. What the hell? You drove on the flat? Wait... We can't afford to be reckless. There's no point to your violence right now. We're not mass murderers. - Where are you going? - Where are we going? Nowhere until I fix that tire. Why don't we just take one of the other cars, Jeff? Think! Sometimes I feel like you're just doing things to get attention. Because I'm drawing all sorts of attention to us coming here in the middle of frickin' nowhere, la, la, la, la, la. If someone finds out about that tow truck... Babe, he was married and vile and perverse, and he hit on me. I thought you'd be proud of me. He hit on you? And he was into some real sick shit too. Pigs and goats and bestiality bullshit. All right. I need you to trust me. I do. I just... I wanna make sure we're on the same page. How's Krissy? I told you earlier, she's physically healthy. She quotes a lot of scripture. I doubt she learned much else in the cult. Do you really think she killed all those people? She's a pretty little thing and I guess she's manipulative, but some of those guys were big men. She didn't even have a bruise on her. She confessed, didn't she? There's a lot of detail about certain killings and not others. She goes on for four pages about how and why she killed Hank. Her statement about Gill is full of anger and rage. It's self-righteous. But she mentions Stewart only once. He was beaten to death. It wasn't with a knife. Seems more likely that Jeff killed him. But why would she confess to something he did? Did you talk to Emery or Brenda? They do not wanna talk. - I bet they don't. - What does that mean? I was telling you about Hank. We were on our way to Emery's and we came across Hank's tow truck, but no Hank. Come on. What do you think Emery and Brenda are hiding? Better question is... Why did Emery and Brenda survive? I'll check out the car. Now you take care of Emery. Krissy, you sick bitch. I'm gonna kill you! No. Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh. Oh, fuck. Oh, Jesus. Emery! Emery! Emery! So how are we gonna do this? I stuck him in the leg. We're not. What? Why? 'Cause I think they can make it. So you're giving them a second chance? They were in love the whole time. Oh, fuck. Oh, Jesus. Oh, god. Ah, shit. Look at this beauty. Look at this perfection. Sappy man. Human beings can be this perfect. This harmonious. We just keep fucking up. If I could only create balance. Little understanding of how easy it is to... Lose it all. When I was a child, I never felt safe. Never felt safe my whole life. Today I saw a love story. Imperfect, sure, but... An honest love story. All this fear we grow up with, Krissy, the fear you felt in the group, the fear Brenda and Emery felt of us. I don't wanna fear. All this fighting, and nobody cares. Do you know the difference between right and wrong? - Gun. - FBI, drop your weapon. Sheriff's department. Drop your weapon. Get on the ground, ma'am! Get on the ground! Thank god you're here. Drop your weapon, sir! You don't wanna hurt me. - You're my brother. - Don't move, sir. And our intentions match. You're officers of peace, right? Agent...? I'm a citizen who wants peace. Why wound someone with good intentions? Ma'am, put your hands in the air! They call this "artwork." Drop your weapon. Okay, brother. I'm gonna drop my gun. Agh! To be a police officer, you have to know the difference between right and wrong. I believe that... People who commit crimes should be punished for 'em. The diorama killer was a bad guy, right? He killed over ten people we know of. But he let Brenda and Emery survive. Maybe you killed him before he had a chance. He did beat and torture them. The righteous kill. They gave me a medal of valor for that. People think you're a hero. Do you regret taking the shot? What if Jeff and Krissy didn't kill the therapist? Then who did? Emery was the only other person there. Emery? Why would Emery kill Stewart? And why would Krissy confess to it? Do you believe in second chances? What kind of person deserves a second chance? A good guy? A stand-up guy? A guy who's suffered, who's made mistakes? Bad, bad mistakes. And who loves his wife. Maybe. And what about the serial killer who gave him that second chance? Blessed is she, the daughter of peace that hath found a place within his kingdom. My tears are all flowed. I cannot cry more for these things, for these things. We're forever. I have to go to sleep now, baby. How guilty are a couple of screwed-up kids? A couple of kids who've seen the worst abuse you can see? A couple of kids who have killed, who've murdered, who've tortured... But who believed in love enough to take the blame for another man's sins? Was there any evidence to confirm that? Brenda and Emery survived. Survived as people, survived as a couple. - But... - There's your ending. That rebirth came at a price. Everyone involved paid for their survival, paid for their renewal. Even me. Maybe it was worth it. You should end it that way. Focus on the survivors. A happy ending.
