Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Gee, Mother, just look at the snow! It's going to be great spending Christmas up here, isn't it? Yes. You know, we always almost always had a white Christmas... ...back east when I was a little girl. - Hm, he's in a hurry. - Evidently. I just wanted to warn you to take it easy, sir. We've got several slides, and the road's pretty bad up ahead. Alright, thanks. Never mind, Mother, it's only that man. Yes, but we mustn't be rude, even to men, darling. Unnecessarily rude. - No harm done. - Thanks. Thanks for your warning, too. There's no such thing as a dangerous road. If you know how to drive! Here they are, Fred, they've arrived. - Our very first guests. - Boys, get that luggage. Not you, take your place. That's... that's good enough. Get this ladder out of the way. Oh, lend a hand there. Careful with those bags, boys. Hurry. Now, darling, you're not catching cold. - Of course not, Mother, dear. - Oh, I'm afraid you are. - Can I help you, sir? Here, where can I put this? - Here, I'll take it, sir. - Thank you. Excuse me, please. Well, well, our very first guests. - Welcome to Snowcrest Lodge. - Thanks. I've a reservation, Blake's the name, Steven Blake. If you'll just register, sir. Uh, Fred... What rooms are we holding for Mr. and Mrs. Blake? There is no Mrs. Blake. I'm Mrs. Edith Farnham. I have reservations for myself, my daughter and my maid. I beg your pardon, but as you came in together, I naturally thought... You should have seen the way that fell. Yeah, perhaps I should. May I help you, sir? Oh, look! Your mirror's broke. That means seven years bad luck. Thanks. - Brenda. - Yes, Mother? Billy, show Mrs. Farnham to suite 23. Come, boys, lend a hand. Oh, this is very pleasant. You can put those bags in the other room. Yes, ma'am. What a terrible smell of paint. Oh, I'm sorry, madam. I'll open this window and I'm sure it'll air out soon. All right. - Shall I light the fire for you? - Yes, please. But leave the window open, it's terrible in here, really. Yes, ma'am. - Well, it isn't quite so pungent. - Anything else, ma'am? No, thank you, that's all. Give this to the other boy, will you, please? Thank you. - What is it, dear? - Mother, I knocked that suitcase off. I know it. But I'm glad you told me. I wouldn't have done it if it hadn't been anybody else but that old crosspatch. - Or any other male, I'm afraid. - I'm sorry. So am I. Mostly because I'm quite sure I'm to blame. Come here, darling. Brenda, you and I have had a tough time. But just because we've had one unfortunate experience, I don't want you to be prejudiced against men all your life. But you are. You see, it is my fault. Nothing's your fault. You're the most wonderful... Uh, am I going to get that pair of skates for Christmas, do you think? If you don't, I suppose I'm not so wonderful. Oh, no! But am I? I wouldn't be surprised. Oh, you are the most wonderful person in the whole world. I'm going to be the sickest in a minute. That odor of paint is getting stronger every second. Funny, I can't smell it at all. Darling, you are catching cold. - Ellen! - Yes, ma'am? - We must get Brenda to bed immediately. - Oh, Mother. Wouldn't you rather go to bed now than risk being sick on Christmas Day? - That would be terrible. - Now run along to Ellen. I'm going downstairs for a minute. Yes, paint. Fresh paint. Well, you see... Oh, here's the manager now, Mrs. Farnham. I tell you, it's positively sickening. I know it, Mr. Blake, and I'm very, very sorry. But you must have one room in the hotel that wasn't painted yesterday. I'm sorry, sir, but I'm afraid not. I'm afraid they're all about the same. Are you bothered by the paint, too, Mrs. Farnham? Me? Oh, no, I find it rather refreshing. - There's a call for you, sir. - Fred, the phone. Hello? Yes? Good heavens, you can't mean it! - But that's impossible! - What is it, Fred? And only two cars got through before it happened? - What is it? - Well, something's got to de done, man! Right away! Well, keep us informed, won't you? - Well? - A bad snowslide several miles down. - What? - They say the road is absolutely impassable. They doubt if it can be cleared away before tomorrow. - Oh... - Or the next day. Oh, this is a catastrophe. How can we have a gala opening without people? A thing like this never happened to my hotel at Palm Beach. So look here, do you mean to say that we... ...that there won't be any other guests in this barn? - I'm afraid so, sir. - Er, well, only until tomorrow, Mr. Blake. And you weren't expecting your son today anyway, were you? No, but I don't relish the idea of being a hermit. Uh, there's no danger of starvation, is there? I mean, we won't have to draw lots to see who's to be eating first, will we? Mrs. Farnham, don't let it upset you, please. We'll have the gala opening just the same. Oh, we'll see that you enjoy yourselves. Fred. Phone Mr. Peabody and Mr. Snirley. Tell them to report at the desk at once. - Get Peabody and Snirley. - Yes, sir. Twenty-five waiters, four chefs. A ten-piece jazz band and two guests. - Good morning. - Huh? Oh, good morning. Snirley is the name, Mr. Blake. If I may take the liberty of introducing myself. Oh! How are you? Oh, so it was a mistake about only two cars getting through. Oh, I'm not a guest, Mr. Blake. My official title is sports director. But I hope you won't let that stand between us. I like to think of myself as just one of the gang. - Yeah, what did you say your name was? - Snirley. Ralph P. Snirley. It's rather an odd name but, er... Oh, that's alright, I once knew a man named Snipe. Oh, excuse me, I'm so sorry. - What are those, ski boots? - Oh, yes... Oh, pardon me. My dear Mrs. Farnham. - I'm Miss Peabody, the hostess. - Oh. I hope you don't mind my bursting upon you like this. - But I simply had to see you. - Well, here I am. Well, I feel as if I were looking at a ghost. Oh, I didn't realize I looked quite that bad. Oh, no, my dear! You look enchanting. Positively enchanting. But when I think that at this very minute... ...you might be lying beneath ten feet of snow, stiff, but stiff! I didn't realize I had such a narrow escape. Just a matter of inches, my dear, but inches. No, thank you. I really have no desire to go skiing with Mrs. Farnham. Well, then, just us two old fellows. No, thank you. I'll wait till my son arrives. Ah, a son. And how old is he, young man? - Ten. - How fortunate for the boy... ...to have a father's companionship. Though you'd never guess it, I was brought up by a maiden aunt. - Oh, is that so? - And our other guest too. That nice-looking Mr. Blake. You really must let me introduce you to him. No, no, thank you. I prefer not to. Aha, mustn't be shy. After all, you and he might have been buried together. - Under that avalanche. - Oh, very cozy, no doubt. But the fact is I've been buried with one man for several years... - and now that I've dug my way out... - Oh, divorced? Yes. Of course I'm not nearly as agile in my chosen field... ...as I might have been had I started earlier. But it's style that counts, I always say. - Take skiing, for instance? - Um, do you get winded easily? As a matter of fact I do, very. That's what I meant when... I think I'll change my mind and go skiing with you, after all. That's the spirit. I have an outfit I can lend you. You must have been a child yourself when you married, but a child! - Yes, I was eight. - Hm? - Or eighteen, somewhere along there. - Oh. Now, if you don't mind, I think I'll change and get a little fresh air. You know, the smell of paint is all through this... - I've been longing for a walk myself. - Oh, have you? I'll change too and meet you right back here. Yes, yes, I could do that. That's it! All you have to do is to let yourself go, old chap. Think of yourself, if you can, as a little bit of fluff... ...floating in the breeze. I thought you said you got winded easily. - When I get winded, I can't talk. - Huh? Oh, yes. Well, come on, let's go. Oh! Oh, look! Oh, dear! Oh, dear. I'm sorry... That's it! Courage is the word! I always tell my pupils to think of the snow as a great feather bed. Here, let me give you a hand. - Finished with your dinner, darling? - Yes, Mother. Well, I think I'll go down and have mine then. - Here, Ellen. - Why, Mother, aren't you going to wear that beautiful gold dress? And waste it on this morgue? I should say not. - Watch out, you'll catch my cold. - What of it? Someday I'll let you catch mine. Why, Mrs. Farnham, is that being a scientific mother? - Good evening, Mr. Blake. - Good evening. Well! Reminds me of the first Christmas in America. Before the indians came. Yes, it is a catastrophe. Such a thing never occurred at my hotel at Lake Placid. Mr. Blake, I have your table reserved. Well, that was thoughtful of you. - Good evening. - Good evening. Good evening. Ralph! - Good evening. - Good evening. This way, madam. I'd prefer a table on the other side if you don't mind. Certainly, madam. - Oh, good evening. - Good evening. Um, won't you... I... excuse me. Well, here I come. Loaded with good cheer. Heinrich, I'll have my dinner here, if Mrs. Farnham doesn't mind. It's so boring for one to eat alone, don't you think? Yes, but I think perhaps I'd better, for your sake. My little daughter has a very bad cold and I'd hate to give it to you. Poof, my dear! I never catch cold. I'm bursting with health. Germs run away from me. - Yes, actually run away. - I'm sure they do. Here. You must have one of these. Thank you. - Cheerio! - Oh now, look here, Snipes. Snirley is the name. Oh, don't tell me you're not going to join in. - Why, this is our gala opening, Mr. Blake. - Yes, it looks gala. Oh, it isn't the numbers that count. It's the spirit of the thing. Think of those Englishmen in far-flung places... ...who dress for dinner every night even though they dine alone. Well, dining alone can have its points. There's too little of the carnival spirit in modern life. We need more gusto. More joy of life, more robustness. Come, have one, old chap. You be robust, I'll watch. Oh, you're just a little self-conscious. You'll get over that. Never mind, I'll serve it. Why, mind what you do, when you need an outlet for pent-up emotions. I have no pent-up emotion. There, you see? Come, keep one of these and throw it. First thing you know, you'll be in the throes! You know, for the first time in my life I'm beginning to have a pent-up emotion. Get it a loud clat, old fellow. Give vent to it. No, no, I think I'd need something sharper and heavier than that. Ah, to you, Mr. Blake, these serpentines are just colored bits of paper. But to me they're a study in human nature. - Oh. - Uh-huh. You see, I'm a bit of a psychologist. - Oh, you are? - Yes. Now... now, when I see a man fling one right in the air like this... I say to myself, there's a man who tosses off his cares lightly. Now, if I see him throw one tensely like this... I say, there's a man who would like to be gay but cannot. Now, when I see him grit his teeth and do this... I say, there's a man in the grip of savage emotions. He may have murder in his heart. Oh! Oh, dear, dear. George, quickly! Oh, my goodness. I beg your pardon. Don't worry, old chap, it was all in fun. You know, I think I will try one of these things. As long as we're being so gay! I told you. See how she's taking it? Yes, I see. I told you, old chap! Keep going, this is so much fun! Two to one! And you said your aim wasn't good. - Why, you're marvelous! - Am I? Well, watch this! I, um... I hope I'm not too late for our walk. Huh? Oh, right on the dot, dear lady. Just to get away from that germicidal female, you understand? - Perfectly, I'm the lesser of two evils. - You're positively psychic. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning... You know, Mr. Blake, I'm looking forward to this. It's such a beautiful morning. Are you quite sure you're dressed warmly enough? - Oh, I'm so sorry! - Almost too warm at the moment. So, you cute things, you stole the march on us and got acquainted after all. I told you, the spirit of carnival! Shall we make that little walk a foursome, old chap? Oh, no, that would be just too jolly, old sock, but... You see, as a matter of fact, Mrs. Farnham and I have, um... have decided to brush up on our Esperanto. I know. Esperanto, one of those languages only two can speak. Well, we'd better be going, Edith. The darlings. Makes one feel romantic oneself just to watch them, doesn't it? Would you mind telling me what there is about me that's so screamingly funny? No, not at all. There's a smudge on the end of your nose. Well, why didn't you say so? I thought we weren't going to converse. Serves me right for being so cussed. - I have been rather cussed, haven't I? - Yes. But you were cussed in a charming way. Mine was just plain cussedness. I owe you an apology for the way my child behaved. The poor darling is praying through the nose. - She's in bed with a cold. - Oh, that's a shame. I am sorry. I have a youngster about her age, a boy. Is he, er... with his mother? - No, she died when he was born. - Oh. He's coming to join me as soon as his school closes. Oh, that'll be nice. It'll be so good for Brenda to get used to masculine companionship. You see, I'm divorced. She's been alone with me too much for her own good, I'm afraid. I know just how you feel. Like Tommy and me, we, we... we get to living in a little world all our own. Hm-hmm. My, look at that. You know, Mrs. Farnham, I'm tempted to make a confession to you. I'm glad you happened to have that smudge on your nose. Don't tell me the stern Mr. Blake is flirting with me. Outrageously. Until the road clears, you might as well grin and bear it. Don't forget, my proud beauty, it's the only flirting to be had in these parts. Just until the road clears, hm? Well... Oh. Well, it was great while it lasted. Nice to have seen you. - Well, do I look nice, honey? - Yes. I thought you weren't going to wear that gold dress up here. Well... Oh, you know... ...with crowds of new people arriving and everything. Mother, what were you doing all day today? Why, honey, I told you I went for a walk and... Alone? You know, darling, your cold is getting much better. Now let's keep right after it, open your mouth. Ahh, ahh! Wide open, wide... Wide open, that's it, wide... Take the young man's luggage up to Mr. Blake's room. You can amuse yourself till your father comes back, can't you, Tommy? Oh, sure. Where did Mr. Blake go, do you know? Why, Mr. Blake went skating with a lady. With a lady? Well then, would you give this mail to Mr. Blake? - Yes, certainly. Jake! - Yes, sir? - And tell him... - Ask him! Ask him! - Hm? - You know what! Oh, yes, by the way, do you allow dogs in the lodge? - Dogs? - No, just one dog. I'm sorry, sir, there's a very strict rule. - Oh, well, I just wondered. - Yes, we just wondered. You'll explain to Mr. Blake, won't you, something important has just come up... ...which necessitates my hurrying back to town. - Certainly, sir. - Well, goodbye, Tommy. Oh, I'll walk to the car and see you off. Alright, then, that would be lovely, yes. Too bad, Tommy. Looks as if I'll have to take the dog back with me. No you won't. Why Harold's my Christmas present to Dad. And besides, we don't run across a dog like Harold every day in the week. Attaboy, Harold, don't you worry, nobody's gonna send you back. But Tommy, if they won't let you keep it... - We'll find a place to keep him, alright. - Oh, fine. - Nice dog. - Gee, you mean you'll help us out? Maybe. Gosh, why, we can hide him in the wood cellar or something. And when Dad gets him for a Christmas present, he'll make them let him stay here. Yes... Well, than you, thank you very much. - Goodbye, Tommy! - Goodbye. Goodbye. You stay here a minute. I'll see you around the back later. Okay. - Goodbye! - Goodbye, Tommy! Did you do that? - What? - You know what! - Ouch! You stop that! - Stop what? Give me that! That's the way you made those eyes. You spit these things. I pit 'em. Do you still talk baby talk? Dumbbell, that's not baby talk, that's the name of it, pitting. And I'm the champion pitter of Los Angeles. Well, don't you pit my snowlady anymore! Go away! Who ever heard of a snowlady? Why didn't you build a snowman? Cause I don't want any kind of a man around me at all, ever. I don't guess you'll be bothered much. Not with those freckles. You horrid, nasty old boy, you ruined my snowlady! - I'll fix you! - Oh, yeah? You will, will ya? Now take that! Why did you ruin my snowlady for? I didn't do anything! Take that! You did so, you big gorrilla, you! Ally-oop! Oh, I'm afraid it's the altitude! You're winded after all that skating, huh? I hope we get back before Tommy arrives. So do I. He'll be disappointed if I'm not there. I'm so glad Brenda was able to get up today. I can hardly wait to see what happens when they meet each other. - Tommy may be shy at first. - Oh, poor Brenda will be too. But outside of this feeling about the opposite sex, she's fundamentally a sweet-natured young squirt. Oh, Tommy too. He's a little gentleman. Well, wouldn't you think parents would train their children not to be public nuisances? I certainly would. Hey, you children! Brenda! Mother! You! Mother! Mother! - Mother! - Why, Brenda! Who is that fiendish little boy? Hey, Dad! Dad! I thought you'd never come. Well, he... he got here sooner than I expected. Tommy! What's the meaning of this behavior? Oh, I'm sure that Brenda's just as much to blame as he is. - I am not! - Brenda! Tommy, that'll do. Tommy! That'll do, Tommy! - No matter what she did. - What? Remember, she's a little girl. Well, I think I must get Brenda into some dry clothes. I'll have a talk with Tommy too. We can introduce them later. Although they seem to have broken the ice already. I mean, uh... Who did start that row, son? Well, I guess I did, Dad, but she was a pain in the neck. - All girls are. - Now, Tommy, you must get over that idea. First thing you know, we'll be a couple of roughnecks. Women... well, after all, they do make gentlemen out of us. Yeah, and that's the trouble. What if I wasn't nice to him. We don't want those two hanging around. Listen, Brenda, You've got to star learning how to get along with men sometime. It's funny you want me to start with that particular boy. He can't be very nice when he's got such a mean old father. Why, Brenda, how can you say such a thing? Mr. Blake's a charming man. And he's... - Well, anyway, as far as men go, he... I guess he likes gold dresses too. And I guess you were glad I got that cold so you could see him all the time. Oh, darling, what a dreadful thing to say to Mother. Well. Come here. I know a good story that I've never told you before. It's about seven men. And every last one of them was eaten up by an alligator. I'm going to like this one. Oh, darling. Did I ever tell you you're the best dancer west of the Mississippi? No, why didn't you? Edith... Ever wish your child was grown up, past any danger of being hurt by what you might do? I wish it as often as you do, probably. You see, I gave Brenda one bad deal. I have to be doubly careful. I know. Aren't you dancing tonight? - Yes, I have been. - What a lovely scene. Oh, just look at those two. What a charming couple they make. Well, if that doesn't mean wedding bells, I miss my guess? It takes the montains to bring out the romance in people. How many mountains does it take? Say, is this your room? This is our suite. Hey, do you want your father to marry my mother? And have a woman bossing me around? I should say not. Besides, you don't think I want you for a sister, do you? Well, I certainly don't want you. Sit down! And that isn't the worst of it. We wouldn't have them to ourselves anymore at all. Gosh, what'll we do about it? Make them not want to get married, stupid! How? Well, my mother wouldn't make me live with anybody I hated. - Would your father? - Of course not. Well, then it's easy. All we gotta do is to show them we don't like each other. Say, you mean fight all the time, like we did today? Well, um... - Scared, huh? - I am not scared. Only I promised my mother I wouldn't hit you again. You wouldn't hit ME? Anyway, there's plenty other ways I can show them. Just what you'd expect from a girl. Full of hot air. - Who's full of hot air? - Who do you think? I think you are. You're just like all men, you're just like your old father. Say, don't you say anything about my father! - It's your mother that started all this! - My mother? Why, you dirty little fibber. - My mother's the most... I'll hit you! - Go ahead! Say, you know? Uh, we shouldn't get worn out like this when they can't hear us. Now, you go on to your room. I have to go to bed. Yeah, so do I. Well, good night. I'll try and think of something by tomorrow. I'll do all the thinking around here. - Ah, good morning. - Good morning. - You'd care to have your lunch now? - Oh, not just yet, thank you. Have you seen anything of our children this morning? Yes, ma'am, they had their breakfast very early. Were they together? No, but they were passing notes to each other every few minutes. - Just like little sweethearts. - Oh! Just like little sweethearts. There they are! Let's do it now! Okay. - You get on first and slide down. I'll get on right after you and bump you onto the floor. - What? - Sure! Say, I got a better idea. You get on the other way. Doesn't this follow, the children beginning to getting to like each other? I'm delighted, Steve. - Yes, that's it. - Like this? Yeah, but how are you gonna get on in front of me? I'll show you! Hey! Hey! Bless my soul, bless my soul. Dear boy! - Here, let me help you. - Go away, go away! - Go away, you too! - Yeah? Did you hurt yourself bad enough so he might take you away from here? No! - Did you hear that? - Hurt yourself, son? - No, sir. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - You could have hurt yourself real bad! Oh, you could have hurt yourself real bad, she said to him. Why, she's just like a dear little mother. Why... why... it's a big fib! I wasn't either a dear little mother! Why, Dad, she's the one that pushed me down! - Yeah! - Uh-huh. She's the one that wrote you those notes at breakfast too. I'll never forget the first time I was accused of taking a shine to a girl. - What? - I tried to pretend I hated her too. Oh, the little lambie pies. I... I'm not a lambie pie! - But I'd like to lam you! - Brenda! Go to your room and get ready for lunch. You go along too, Tommy. Well! Well! Look, Edith, as long as the children are getting along so beautifully, why don't the four of us have lunch together? That's a grand idea, Steve. How do you like that? I work hard to break your neck... ...and they think we're lambie pies. Yeah! Say, you wanna know who pushed you? She did. - What's that to you? - Who's he? Aw, he's a dumb suit with a mother. Look at those pants. You two think you're having a lot of fun, don't you? Wouldn't you like to have some? Maybe I would, maybe I wouldn't. - What could we do? - Horace! Horace! Horace! 0h, there you are, dear. Come with mother. I want you to scrub your hands thoroughly. - And put some perfume on yourself, Horace. - Yes. - What's that? - Nothing. Come dear. But, Mother, we were going to have some fun. Come, dear! Hey, we got to wash too. Score's on the bathroom. Oh, no, that's my bathroom! Hey, you! Hey, kid! - Hey, where are you? - Hello. Oh, there you are. Come here. Hey, you can take back your dollar along with your dog. Harold! Yeah, you can keep him. Here's your dollar. - Here. - Oh, but gee, mister! - You've got to take care of him. - I'm sorry, son, but it barks too much. If I got caught with him in the furnace room, I'd lose my job sure. - Aw, gee, mister... - Shhh! All that dog does all day long is yap, yap, yap, yap. I'm through. Who is it? What's that? It's a dog, what do you think it is? - It's a funny kind of one. - It isn't either funny. - It's a genuine St. Bernard. - A St. Bernard? Why, a St. Bernard is a man with a big dog. Well, the man said the California sun kind of withered him a little. - Say! I got an idea! - What? After I give him to Dad for Christmas tomorrow, I'll sic him on to you, in front of everybody. You mean so's he'll bite? Sure! That'll show I haven't taken any shine to you. You'll do no such thing. He's not withered enough for that. Oh, Harold won't hurt you unless I tell him to. Harold's a real. real good dog. And he won't take orders from nobody else but me. Now, come on, Harold. What do you say you stand up and play? - Yes. - Sit down, Harold! Oh, he's just tired or something. He won't do anything else you say. He will so! He'll do anything I say. - He won't either! - He will so! He'll even eat this soap if I tell him to. Soap! Here, Harold. Why, Harold! Do you want some more, Harold? Hey, cut that out! Do you want to make him sick! Oh, it won't. Mother washed my mouth out with soap once. - She did? - Yeah, before she decided... - ...to be a scientific mother. - Oh. But it didn't make me sick. I liked it. Yeah, you would. But don't you dare give any to my dog again. I'll give him some more right now if I want. Here, Harold! Here, Harold! Here, Harold! Hey, don't you give him any more of that stuff! I will so! Here, Harold! Here, Harold! Oh... Max! Get out! Look! Mad dog! You let me get to feed him first! Brenda! Brenda! Stand back! Keep away from that dog! Oh, thank you, Tommy, I'll never forget your saving Brenda like that. Good work, son. It was fine the way you protected that little girl. What? Why, he wasn't even protecting me. Of course I wasn't. Anyhow, that dog wouldn't hurt anybody. He belongs to me, and I guess I ought to know. But Tommy, you have no dog. It's alright to be modest, but you mustn't lie. It is his dog alright, I know. And the only reason he was pushing me was because... Because I was going to feed him this. - This what? - I... I guess I lost it. Now, darling, you're entirely too overwrought. We're going to calm down and have a nice lunch. - The four of us. - That's right. I won't eat in the same table with him! Wh-what makes you think I'd eat with you? Now, just for that, young man, you'll eat by yourself. Yes, sir. - The little... - Now, now. Well, how can you figure kids? Well, Fred, it's been a trying morning. It's all right, sir. Everything is quiet now. Hey! Even if you are a girl, I got a mind to black both your eyes. Aw! Hey, come here. Say, do you have any more of those little bolts? You know, the little black beans you blackened my snowlady's eyes with. Sure! What of it? Listen, you pit them at me at lunch, and I'll tell on you. That oughta show we don't like each other, huh? Well, rough stuff in public spaces makes Dad sore, and I'll get punished. - Still... - Well, I'll get pitted, won't I? - That's even. - Yeah. - Shh! Go away. - Yeah. Poor little Tommy over there, all alone. He's such a chivalrous little fellow, too. Well, what are we going to have for lunch? Thank you. Ow! - Ouch! - What in the world... Somebody's hitting me with things. - Hitting you? - Ouch! Why! Oh! Why, what's the matter? Oh! Oh! Ouch! What in the world... Horace, did you do that? - Who, I, Mother? - Oh, of course not, dear. - What... what's happened here? - I don't know. Something happened too here, please? What the dickens is the matter with this place? Well, sir, it's Tommy! He's pitting things. - BB shots. - Pitting? Tommy! Why, Brenda, that's absurd. Excuse me a minute, Edith. Tommy, I can't believe it of you, but are you responsible for all this? Well, you see, Dad... Just a moment. It was I, sir, not he. - You? - Yes, indeed! Horace! If this is true, not a single one of your Christmas presents will you get tomorrow. - Not even the butterfly net. - It's quite true, Mother. He didn't mean to do it, Dad, I did! Are you crazy? What do you want to lie like that for... ...when it means you won't get your presents? Yeah, just think of your presents. - I have! - What? Dad, you saw me do it, didn't you? It was my BB shot. Tommy, I remember your taking the blame once for another boy at school, but I can't let you go on that way forever. - Aw, gee! - If you did it, let's see your BB shot. - I... I used it... I used it all up. - Uh-huh. Sit down. It was I, sir, who aimed Miss Peabody on her beezer. Oh! And sniped that gentleman over there on his bald dome. And stung that fat lady on her way to be seated. - What? - yes, sir. See for yourself. Horace! Go to your room at once! Yes, Mother. Oh, what a disgrace! What a humiliation! Mother, I tell you, it isn't fair! - Dad, won't you please listen... - Keep quiet, son. We know you're a good sport. And we know you two like each other. So there's no use your trying to make us think differently. We're getting a little tired of it. Oh, alright, Dad, but... Mother, may we go tell that poor little boy that we'll share out presents with him? - Well... - Yeah, Dad! Uh, can we? Why, yes, son, of course you can. Run along. Oh, boy. Well, I... I guess we can go for our walk now, Edith. - Isn't this grand? - Say, Edith... I've been wanting to... Well, I mean, I've been waiting to... Hey, clear now! Hey! Hey! Look out! Watch out! - Oh, I'm so sorry. - Come on. - Where are you going? - Oh, I know a quiet place, no mad people, no jolly dogs and no children! - Sit down! - Wait a minute! Hold tight! Edith! - Edith! - What? - I love you! - Good! - Will you marry me? - Will I? Would you mind saying that a little louder? Is that loud enough? Yes. Yes. Listen, Tommy, I've been thinking. As long as nothing's worked out yet, what's the sense in us getting in wrong now? Tomorrow's Christmas. We can make a fresh start after we get our presents. Yeah, if we keep on like this, why, we may not get any. That'd be terrible. - Flag of truth? - Hm-hmm. Okay. Now don't forget, 'cause Christmas is sacred. Come in. Come right in. This way, please. Ladies and gentlemen, our Old English Carol singers. Oh, boy! Gosh, look how big it is! - Oh, Mother, isn't it beautiful? - Yes, darling. You! Ooh! - You nasty old cheat! - Well, who started it? You did! You started it! You started... Brenda! Brenda! Tommy, stop that! Here, Tommy! Tommy! - Come back here! - Tommy, come back here! Don't you know this is Christmas Eve, Tommy? Come here! Tommy, stop that! Stop it, Tommy! Tommy, come here. Come here, Tommy! Tommy, come here! Tommy, stop that! Tommy, stop it, will you? Tommy! Tommy, what are you trying to do? Come here. Look! Look, it's him! - It's Horace! - Oh, it is, huh? Get a hold of things! Get the punch bowl! Oh, Snirley! Nothing like this ever happened anywhere! get in there! Go on, both of you! - But it wasn't our fault, Dad, honest! - It wasn't, Mother! - Don't make it worse by lying. - No. It's bad enough to do a thing, you don't have to lie. Now look at that! Look at that, now. You've blown out every fuse in the place. Doggone it! I can't understand you children. You've been so angelical all day helping each other, then to... I don't know what's gotten into you. Nothing's gotten into us, Mother, it's gotten into Horace! - Horace? - Yeah, he started it! - Why, Tommy! - Why, you! First you take the blame for Horace and now you want to get him into trouble. Do you take your parents for a couple of halfwits? - Yes, sir. - What? - Confound it! - Brenda! I didn't mean it that way, but gee, when we do tell the truth... That'll do! It's a good thing you're going to have a father, young lady. You need a little disciplining. Yes, and a mother's refining influence won't do you any harm either, young man. You... You mean you two are going to get married? If we ever live through this disgrace, we are. - But, Mother, you... - Not another word. You go to your room and get into bed. And don't expect any Christmas presents in the morning. - Oh! - And that goes to you, too, young man. Aw, gee! Perhaps you'll think twice next time before acting this way again. Of all the ungrateful, ill-mannered, impossible little... No Christmas! Phooey! - That settles it! - I didn't do it on purpose! You did do it on... Come here! Tommy, come here! Come here, I'll teach you to talk to me that way! Don't you dare try to get away from me! Stop, that's enough! Let me go! Steve! Why, Brenda! How in the... I... I'm sorry, Brenda. That's what you get for wearing pants. You go to your room. And don't let me hear another peep out of you! I'll attend to you later! Get in bed, darling. I'll come in after a while. - Steve! - Edith, you want to save my life? - Then give me a drink. - There's some brandy right there. Steve, I... I didn't think you could treat a child like that. Well, that's the first time in my life I ever spanked Tommy. - You mean Brenda! - Hm? Well, even if it was Brenda, haven't I said I'm sorry? - Yes. - Hm? Well, considering that I didn't mean to do it, it wasn't much of a spanking. And that she bit me. I hope she won't hold it against me. Oh, Brenda's too nice to hold grudges. Of course she is. And so are you. Tell me you're not angry. That's not the point, Steve. I'm afraid you and I have made a mistake. You mean you don't love me? What I mean is that we must consider the youngsters. We were wrong about it, they really dislike each other. They'd both be miserable. I see. Then it's all washed up. I'm afraid so. Don't you see, Steve, it's the only sensible thing to do. Oh, wake up, Edith! You're young and beautiful. You have a life of your own to live. I know you want to be square with the youngsters, and so do I, but that's no reason for us to consider our own lives as finished. All that's happened is that a couple of kids have acted like kids. You know? I'm beginning to believe you're right. Maybe it's because I want to believe you're right. Give me some brandy. That's a good idea. I think I'll have a little more too. Shhh! This night, for the first time, I spanked my own child. I mean, I spanked your own child. - It was good for him too. - What? Hm? Well, it was good for him... would have been good for him. It was good for me too. At last I'm emancipated from being an emancipated parent. Are you drunk? Drunk? What do you mean drunk? I mean... down deep inside of you... I think you're gloating with it. I don't like that word, "gloating". Unless it's in the "gloating, oh my darling". # In the gloating # # Oh, my darling # You are drunk. And I'm... I'm glad I found out how you feel about Brenda before it's too late. Oh, Edith, do I have to do penance all the rest of my life... ...just because I spanked a spoiled child? No, and you don't have to see her the rest of your life either. And you don't have to see me! Oh, Edith, don't be an idiot. Sit down and listen to me. Sit down! - I don't like hysterical women. - Hysterical? That's what I said, you're hysterical. I suppose you'll be striking me next. - I'll be what? - Striking me. - The way you struck Brenda over there. - Oh, nonsense. Well you did! Sure... You see this muscle? I got that beating helpless women and little children. But first I practiced on cripples. - A sadist, a vicious character, a... - Don't. Oh, what's the use? - We did it! - Yeah! Mother! Mother, dear. Merry Christmas, Mother! Merry Christmas, darling. Why, Mother! My poor little girl. - I'm so sorry to misjudge you. - Hm? I should have known it was all that Tommy Blake's fault. That man for a father. You mean you don't like Tommy's father anymore? I never want to see him again as long as I live. Brenda, here are your slippers. Thank you. You'd better open your presents right away, darling. And we'll leave as soon as possible. But Mother, you're going to open them with me, aren't you, like you always do? I'm sorry, dear, but I have... all the packing to do. Tommy. Mrs. Farnham and I aren't going to get married after all. Dad, honest? Gee, that's swell! I don't mind going now. But what do you say we have our Christmas first? Wait a minute. Aw, of course Harold was my biggest present to you but... I guess his wolf blood got the best of him. He's probably running with the pack again. Hey, Dad! Thanks, son. I'm gonna wait and open it up when we get home. I guess I won't open mine till then... ...either. Why, Mother, where are you going? I'm going to a waffle breakfast, darling. A farewell party for me. You don't look so good, Mother. - And besides, tonight's New Year's Eve. - Oh, I'll be home after a while. Then we'll be together the whole time on our trip. Why do we have to go? You don't like Europe. You told me so last time when we got back. - And you got sick there. - Don't worry, I won't get sick this time. And I've got to get away. Some day when you're older, you'll understand. - Goodbye, baby. - Goodbye. Master Tommy, you're wanted on the telephone. Oh, thanks. And when you come back, eat your oatmeal. - Hello. - Hello, Tommy? - This is Brenda. - What the heck are you calling me for? Well, you needn't think I want to talk to you. Just on account of you gotta get your father over here quick... ...and have him make up with my mother. What if he won't? My mother won't let me say his name in front of her either. But if he doesn't stop her from going to Europe, I'm going to have to run away. Oh, you never would. Are you going loony? Oh, don't bother me no more. Good morning, Dad. Good morning, son. - Oh, gee, where is it? - Where's what? Aw, gee, Dad, the tennis racket you was gonna buy me... ...so you could teach me how to play today. Oh, I'm sorry, old man. I'll get it for you first thing tomorrow. Oh, tomorrow's New Year, isn't it? Well, anyway, I couldn't have given you lesson today. I've got a lot of work at the office. Gee whiz, Dad, you don't do nothing except work anymore. All the more money to buy you tennis rackets with. Yeah, but you're so worn out you forget everything all the time. And then you never feel like having any fun anymore. You know, sometimes I think it might have been better if you and that Mrs... Tommy! What did I tell you? Give me a little time, son. Come here! Shhh! What's the idea? What're you doing here? What are you doing here? Well, I got to thinking and... Well, I... I might run away with you. - If you had the nerve to. - If I had the nerve? Come here. Go on! You see, I have run away. Say, you call hiding out like this running away? Well, if Mother can't find me, she'll think I'm gone, won't she? Besides, I don't want to get all tired out and hungry and maybe get lost too. You see that thing on the wall? - What's that? - A cantina. - A what? - A cantina. Has milk and water in it. I got plenty of food too. - What kind of food? - Oh... cake... Say, that ain't such a bad idea. For a girl. If that's the way you're gonna be, you can get right out of here. - Alright, smarty, I'll run away by myself. - Goodbye. You're gonna get sick, that's what. Hey. Come here. Why are you so anxious to run away? - Well... - Well? Well, Dad's been acting kind of funny too. How do you mean? Oh, he stays at the office all the time. I don't get to see him. Yeah, I know. Mother's never home either. - She used to read me stories too. - Good stories? I guess that... that wouldn't be so bad. Once in a while. Except on Saturdays and Sundays. What do you do then? Oh, Dad used to take some of us kids to a baseball game. And he was gonna teach me how to play tennis too. Only tennis? Gee, I'd rather learn to play tennis than... ...than have freckles even. You know? I think we've made a mistake. Yeah. I guess it'd be better to divide them between us than not have them at all. Besides, they might get sick. Old people die of broken hearts, specially ladies. Yeah. And it would be pretty tough on us. Of course I'll always hate you. But I'd do most anything for my dad. Besides, I could go away to school too and... ...I wouldn't have to live with you very long. I catch colds quickly. I'll get a lot of colds so I won't have to talk to you. - Say, if we run away together, why then... - That's what I thought. And Mother won't be able to go to Europe... ...and they'll turn to each other in their hour of need. Yeah, I believe they would. We gotta... Ouch! Gee whiz! Say... I thought running away was hard on the feet. Say, I got an idea. The cook's roadster's right outside. Why don't you go out and get the cushion out of the rumble seat Come on! Hurry up! - There it is. - Alright. Well, how long ago was it that Tommy Blake was here? He came over right after Brenda said she was going over to play... ...with the little girl across the street. Get Mr. Blake on the phone and see if the children are there. Yes, ma'am. - What's his number? - Oh, I don't... Well, my son is missing too! Well, put Mrs. Farnham on, I want to talk to her. Never mind what she told you to tell me. I'll tell her if you... Oh... Oh, hello, Edith. I'm sorry, I... - How are you? - Never mind how I am! Where's Brenda, that son of yours? Well, Brenda phoned him to come over there. - Why, she did not! - She did too! I don't know. Have you called the police? Well, call them. Never mind, I'll call them myself. I'll be right over. Give me the police station. Give me the police station. No, no, the police station. P-O-L-I-C-E. Police! Calling all cars, attention all cars. Be on the lookout, either together or separately, for Brenda Farnham, nine-year-old daughter of Mrs. Edith F... Come on! And Tommy Blake, ten-year-old son of Steven Blake... They may have been kidnapped. Edith! If you I can sit in that house any longer, just sit. While heaven knows what's happening to my baby. - I'm going to the police station. - All right, we'll take my car. No, let's take this one. It has a radio so we can listen to the police reports on the way. - Is that your car? - No, it belongs to the cook. Mine's in the... Oh, what difference does it make? I think I'd better drive. Oh, alright, all right! Watch the doors! Be careful! This way! Why this way? I don't know, I just feel somehow they might have gone this way. No, the other way! Well, make up your mind, or your intuition, or whatever it is. If you don't mind, I'd like to live to see Brenda again. Who, as you may remember, is my child. I hope you live a hundred years. All of them with Brenda. Who, I'm glad to remember, is your child. - They're just scrapping. - It don't look so good. We gotta stay down here until they get really worried... ...and do turn to each other. Yeah, but don't poke me with that darn old skinny elbow. Move over! - Maybe they've heard something. - Calling car 63, car six three. Go to the corner of 6th and Arden. Pick up four men in evening clothes in a drunken party. They're breaking neighbours' windows with hard-boiled eggs. Don't do that! Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm so nervous I'm sick. Really sick! Mother's got nothing on me. I'm sick too. - I need some air. - Well, be careful. It's alright. But it's getting dark. Oh! Maybe they have a clue. Let's follow them. - Well, step on it! - What do you think I'm doing? Happy New Year, officer, Happy New Year! - Let me have your driver's license. - Am I driving? Come on, come on, let have that card. Holy cow! Hey, come on! Hey, you. What are you doing with them two kids? - What kids? - What? - Well, for the love of... - How did they get in there? Go on, tell me you didn't know they were Brenda Farnham and Tommy Blake. - Why, certainly, sir... - Driving around the country with them. You kidnappers think you can get away with anything. What do you think you're trying to get over us? - Brenda! - Jack. - Why, we were looking for them. - We're just on our way to the police station. You bet your life you are. Why, you dumb idiot, we're their parents! You don't tell me! Don't let them scare you, kids. All you gotta do is tell the truth. Now, is that your mother? Huh? My mother? No! - Now, but... - Is he your father? Him? I should say not. Brenda, tell the officer who we are! Tommy, if you don't tell this man instantly... - Don't let him scare you, kid. - I'm her mother and she's his father... I mean, I'm Mrs. Farnham, this is my car, you can... - No, this is the cook's car. - Oh, yes. You see, it's a long... But I can identify myself even if the kids won't! Oh, for the love of... I've left my... - Keep your hands up! - What? - Alright, you stay here, Jack. Call the wagon. Come on, get in the car. Come on, go ahead! Get in there. Make it snappy. # Should auld acquaintance be forgot # # And the days of auld lang syne # # For auld lang syne, my dear # Hello, let me talk to officer Murphy. Say, Kelley, tell the boys not to pick up any more of these holiday drunks. - We haven't got any more cell space. - Yes, sir. The cell block's beginning to look like a coeducational hotel. Say, Murphy? Say, is Mrs. Farnham in yet? Well, when she comes home, tell her we've got the kids. Yeah. Kidnapped. A man and a woman. And get this. He says he's Blake and she's Mrs. Farnham. No, we don't know who they are, we're checking up. They're in plenty of trouble now. That's what they got to have if they're ever gonna get together. I big hour of need. All right, kids, suppose you tell me just what happened. Well... it was simply terrible, officer. Yes. Where were you when they picked you up? In her garage, just talking about things. All of a sudden, they jumped in and grabbed us... ...and began to chloroform us. - Chloroform you? - Well, it wasn't exactly chloroform. We tried to scream, but they were just choking the life out of us. Oh... We'll fix them. # Happy New Year to you # # Happy New Year to you # # Happy New Year, dear children # # Happy New Year to you # A fine New Year's Eve party. - Why can't you prove who we are? - Well, what more can I do? Well, you're a man, you ought to know what to do. I've never been in jail! Sure, I've served life! Now, listen. This is New Year's Eve. I've already phoned five of my friends. Three of them are in Palm Springs and two of them are also pie-eyed. Your maid's gone out with a policeman. My colored boys have evidently gone back to Africa. After living in this city for 35 years, I can't be identified... ...until they find my picture in the rogues gallery. - Have they found it? - No, not yet. Seems like you look pretty much like Rosie the Dope. - They're trying to identify fingerprints. - Fingerprints? As for me, I expect to end my days in prison for murder. I'll kill Brenda quickly, but Tommy's gonna die a lingering death. What in heaven's name got into them? Seriously, Steve, why do you supose they're doing this? I haven't the faintest idea. Seems they wouldn't stop at anything to keep us apart. You know, I think they deliberately conspired to break us up. To make us hate each other. Well, if they did, I guess they've succeeded. # I'm just an unfortunate... # - Oh, shut up! I'll get us out of here. Hey, officer. Officer! Captain! Captain! Captain! Captain! Captain! Pipe down in there, you! But we want out! What's going on in here? - I called you! - Well, what do you want? Are those two little lunatics still sticking to that kidnapping story? - And how! - Well, get them in here... - ...and I'll get the truth out of them. - Oh, yeah? - Yes. - Here's your hat. Thanks. Now, you'd better listen to me. And you'd better hurry up, because when the truth does comes out... ...you're going to look pretty silly. - I'm gonna look silly, huh? - Yes. Happy New Year! Come in here, you kids. - Gee, are they in cells? - Yep, right over there. Yes, we're in cells. How do you like it, Brenda? - Gee! How do you like seeing Mother in jail? Well... It's your won fault. Yes, if you had only did what we wanted you to do. - What? - What did you want us to do? - We... - Happy New Year! Oh, shut up! Oh, what are you high-hatting me for? Because you got a bigger cell than mine? Why, Steve! Hi, Steve! Wait a minute. You know this man? Certainly O know him. Just because he has a bigger cell than mine... he doesn't want to know me. - Oh, yes, Phillips, isn't it? - Tom Phillips. I didn't recognize you! What are you doing here? Trying to say Happy New Year to you, that's what. And if I had a better cell than you... - I'd say Happy New Year, too, Steve. - Steve what? What's his last name? Steve Blake! Everybody knows Steve Blake. - Happy New Year, Steve! - Happy New Year, Tom. - Now will you let us out? - Yes, ma'am. Well, what are you waiting for, let them out! You little rascals! What do you mean by wasting the time of this whole police station? You know what I could do to you for this? Uh, Captain. What's the penalty for lying, criminal perjury and wanton defamation of character? Twenty years of hard labor. After that, the charges of mayhem, arson, malfeasance in office, and even misdemeanor. - Thirty years more. - On bread and water. For criminals as desperate as these, yes. Oh, I'm sorry, Dad! Gee, we didn't... Oh, no, don't call me Dad! You disowned me. - Lock him up, Captain. - Yes. But don't take Brenda, she didn't do anything! - It was all my fault! - It was not! It was not, we both did it. If you take Tommy, you gotta take me too. - Aw, she's just lying. - If Tommy goes to jail, I go too. Now wait a minute. Am I to understand that you like Tommy? Now, wait. Don't say anything that you don't mean. You mean that you two really like each other? - Yes. - Sure. Well, then will you please explain what you and Tommy have been up to? We were just trying to help, Dad. We wanted to bring you together again. - You wanted to what? - You wanted to what? - Well, at first we didn't... - But we changed our minds. Shall I take them away now? Aw, gee, Dad, can't you do something? Can't you, Mother? Well, are you willing to serve a life sentence for Brenda? If you'll serve one for Tommy. Oh, boy! These parents certainly are a lot of trouble. Yes, but they're worth it. Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
