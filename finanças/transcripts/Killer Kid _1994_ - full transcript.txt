LEBANON 1986 Take my brother. Please, he'll be the best. Our family will be shamed If you don't take him. We don't want money, but take him. My name Is Ahmed. You want to stay? The OSPPA will train you. You want to? Of course. Quiet. I'm talking to your brother. I'll make you warriors of Allah. Ali, tell them you want to stay. Yes. I promise together We?ll make it. You want to flight for God? You were chosen among thousands. It's an honor. Ali, say: "Yes, sir. " Yes, sir. Zionism has made you suffer. - He speaks French? - Perfectly. The military training In this camp will let you get revenge. We'll try. Remember you're not children now. You're fully-fledged fighters. You're training for a secret mission of the highest priority. God will choose one of you to carry it out. I want each of you to do his best to be chosen. Dishonor me and I'll kill you. Right, go and get a bed. You'd better deserve our trust. Any wavering, I'll break you. May God protect you. Take good care of my brother. Hey, you! Look over here! Why are you here? To be a soldier! Who's the enemy? The Jews! The Infidels! Good. Why are they our enemies? Their solders are in our land. They stole it. God wants us to annihilate them. Perfect, Djilail You're fit for the Holy War, and your French Is good. Now pay attention and concentrate. Let's get to work. No need for names here. You have to forget them. You'll have a number Instead. You're Number 1. You, Number 2. Remember them! Empty your bags! Empty them on the beds. We don't speak Arabic here. We only use French. You're too old for this. You'll need to speak perfectly. It's vital for the mission. Who's this? My father, killed in action. How did he die? Burned by a flame-thrower. Who did it? The Jews. The Jews! He's with Allah now. Still packed? You're making a fool of me! I'm warning you, don't push me too far! Ali, you can go home now. I hope the rest of you will do good work. Now it's time to sleep. Get to bed. Training starts tomorrow. God Is my witness, we've got nothing no food, no medicine, no clothes and above all no car. $3,000 seems fair to me. You're mad. Djilail has many qualities. So what? I'm not haggling. I'm sorry, my sorrow confused me. His mother will miss him so much. Done! We'll agree to this sacrifice. I'll take your nephew now. Abdel Karim, killed by a Christian bullet in the belly. Silman Akim and his son, burned alive and tortured by three Jews. They're doling this to your people. Mohamed Abdallah, 16, massacred in the street by Christian militia.

Hey, I was just wondering... You haven't got a friend or a sister, around 12 or 13? No. Why, you go for older women? That's a bummer. Ah well, too bad, I'm really sorry. See you. Hold on a minute. Who are your pals there? Introduce us. They don't go for bottle blondes and AIDS donors. Sorry, girls. See ya. Pathetic. They're dating two gorillas. Real violent guys. Fuckin' shit... Let's halt the red-light zone. I'm not comln'. I'm sick of waitin'. Sorry... Oh hi, Isa. What's up? Need a fix? I'm broke. He wouldn't give It me. Stay there. Here's some company. Get lost now. I don't want you here. Please go. Hold me in your arms. Stop putting ODs in my mail box. They'll catch you stealing one of these days. Take me to a concert? See you round. See you. Your dad's gonna yell at you. I'm too old now. Keep him. He's fallen for you. Thanks. Tens of wounded on the pavement. Horror strikes central Paris again. The bomb exploded at 6 p. m. At a Champs Elysees mall. Apparently, one dead and 29 wounded. I was next door. The blast made everything shake and shattered glass. People helped get the victims out. You're making a fool of me! Seen the time? No, Dad. Ten to eleven! And how old are you? Eleven. Exactly. Do kids your age stay out this late? I've had enough! Come on, wake up! Number 2, come with me. Move it! What's up? Why him? Tell me! How would he know? You'll see. I hate you. You think you're the best, huh? I'm going to do the mission. I don't wet my bed. I hope you're ashamed of yourself. You're through. You're not worthy of Allah's army. Number 3, hurry. Number 3, this Is a filthy Jewish dog! A spy! He's killed a lot of Arabs! You burned his father! You deserve to die, bastard! Kill him! He's yours. He killed your father. Shoot him, it's your right! It's your duty. Go on, do it. Don't worry, I'm proud of you. You're a real soldier. This Jewish trash can talk some more. We'll finish him off. Here's your reward. Your people are proud of you. Here, you can keep this. Always carry It on you. It'll make you a hero one day. Okay, Number 3, you can go now. All right... Next! 50... 51, 52... Come on, one more... 53... Again. Get those legs up. 57... Come on, Number 3... 58... Come on, it's too soft! Damn raghead. Motherfucker! I don't want you fighting. Mom, he called me a raghead.

Move or you'll get it! Come on! Move it, asshole! Cut it out! Stand up and get out, or you'll get another! No, no! Help! You'll die, little shit. Mercy, sir, mercy! Know what hanging?s like? Yes. Ever been hung? No. You can't know then. I'll show you. Come on, you little shit. No one's going to hang me. Back off everybody or he dies! Stop, Djilail! it's me, Ahmed! Don't shoot. I'm coming down. You've won. We're your friends... Don't worry. That was the last test. The mission Is yours, Djilail! Think of your family. What's up, dad? My son! Everything?s fine, don't worry. There's a problem, but I'm here. It's okay. It's a security thing. Karim, let's go. Go on, I'll catch up. What's this jive? I can't say. It's a state secret. Don't worry, my son, there's no danger. I've got a surprise for you. You're going on a trip. Come and meet this gentleman. Just for a few days. A holiday. No school. And then home! The secret service! Cool! We goin' to a held-out? Maybe. Come on. Ever killed anyone? Let's see your guns. Bitchln'! Lemme tell the guys... No, we'll take your father home. Fuckin' wheels! A phone! Can I call the guys? I've brought you some coloring, some sweets and some crayons. Thank you, miss. Don't lose this. All your papers are in it. Want some orange juice? Can I have one? Thank you, dear. I'll take two. They never give us any. Those hostesses are so harsh. What's your name? Laid, ma'am. That's a nice name. Going to Paris? Yes, ma'am, to improve my French. I'll take another. You're a very well-behaved boy. That's good, and quite rare these days. Congratulate your parents for me. Cool it, Dad, It's only for a few days. Shit, I've got no clothes. There's a case in the trunk. Awesome! Bye, kiss Mohammed and Mom for me. I'm Hans, operation chief. This Is Bachir. Hello. It's Ali okay. You? He's not an Arab. Don't worry, he's on our side. Is he a Muslim? He's the chief! You can go now. See you later. Right, we'll be back in 3 days. Keep calm and it'll be okay. Make sure you don't hurt him. Don't hurt him! He'll be okay if you do what we say. Call the police. Shut up! We'd never see him again. We'll do what they say. No one will know anything, and Karim will be home in three days. You've spent 6 months learning about him. To make the mission a success, you'll spend a few days with him. Watch him closely, observe how he acts and speaks. On the day, you must act like him so as not to arouse suspicion. What's the target? You'll know soon. Concentrate on Karim for now. Make sure he doesn't escape. What if he asks questions? He'll ask a lot. There's a woman, Khadidja. Say she's your aunt. Your parents sent you because life?s too tough in Lebanon. Talk about your family, the camp, your life there, everything except training. This is your room. Have this bed, that Karim's. If you need anything, ask. Karim, come and be Introduced. This Is Laid, my nephew I mentioned. This Is Karim. He's here for a few days. I'll go and get dinner ready. You're dressed to kill! Who chose your clothes? Wow, those jeans!... Far out. Where did you spring from? Lebanon. They're in deep shit there. What? Life?s tough. Were you in Beirut? No, a camp in the south. Fuck me! Who's he? Chill out! My father. My Dad works for the president. What president? The French president! That's why I'm here, for security reasons. He's the gardener... Well, assistant gardener. Screw that. Comln' out? I'll show you my board. It's a competition one. Laid... Bet there's no boards in Lebanon. Ever tried it? I'll show you. it's cool. I go to the Trocadero sometimes. I'll take you. I don't like that cop, he's an ugly jerk. You don't know Paris? It's full of Lebanese restaurants. Look, this Is my board. I'll show you how. - How old are you? - Eleven. Ace, me too. Pretty good, huh? I've practiced for years. I got my first board at 8. My folks gave It me. It was tough as hell at first. I got really smashed up. Hey, Laid! Are you listening? - What's on your mind? - it's cold. Boys, dinner?s ready! Great, I could eat a horse! Come on, let's eat. I think this Is your favorite, Karim. - Do you like this? - I don't know. You never ate noodles? You're not Lebanese, you're an alien! You're a real pig... Laid, do It the way Karim does. You're slick. Didn?t your Dad teach you to eat? My Dad died in action. Again! You did that last night! You're obsessed! What's the time? Six in the morning... You're a headcase. This guy's wacko. The CSPPA, the committee for Arab political prisoners set the Paris bombs that killed 5 and wounded 61 others, 4 of whom are in a critical condition. The police are investigating eyewitness reports stating the bomb was thrown from a car, probably a black BMW. The latest news with Bruno Ledref. It sounded like an air raid, claims one witness. Windows shattered in the street. The bomb was powerful but as yet the investigation has... Is Karim still asleep? Yes. You aren't too lost here? We warn all those directly or indirectly controlling the bombers that... Do you like this place? No. You're not very talkative. They're scared now. The war Is on their land. They'll learn to mourn their dead like us. Our response will be swift and powerful. They have been warned. A film till Karim gets up? If you like. I'll put any old one In. Rise and shine. Chocolate and hot croissants, just like in a hotel. Come on, Karim. Breakfast in bed... That's classy. You're nice. I want you to have a nice stay here. It can't be worse than school. Croissant? You a cop too? Do you like Laid? Yeah, he makes me laugh. He's a real weirdo. You know, you should be nice to him. He suffered a lot In Lebanon. Shit, you get up early! What've you been doin'? I was watching TV. Your aunt says there's a room for games and music... I'll show you a rap dance. You dress really weird. I'll lend you some gear so you'll be less nerdy. Bitchln', huh? Never heard this? Whatta ya think? Listen, this is the best bit. Far out, huh? Watch now. Break dance, It's easy and it's a blast. You try. We don't do that. C?mon, it's easy! Don't be a jerk! Come on, Laid, don't chicken out! I don't know... Come on, are you a man or not? Bravo, Laid. You two are getting on. I'm helping' him get with it. Here. From your parents. They're well and send their love. Don't worry, you'll soon be home. Everything okay? Ace! We're havin' a good time. Good. Laid, go outside, I want a word. How are things with Karim? Fine but... What's wrong? It's the skateboard. I'll never do It as well as him. I'm sorry. That's okay. You don't need that for the mission. Is that all? Good. Is he suspicious? Good, that's perfect. Remember this mission Is very important. Your people are watching you. Don't disappoint them. Do what we say, and It will go smoothly. If Allah Is willing, we'll win. Paris Is In turmoil. There'll be another bomb today, people killed. The imperialist dogs and Zionist pigs will give In. They'll free our prisoners because our cause Is a just one. The Holy War will triumph. Come and see, it's wild. They'll catch us. You're kidding. We'll keep quiet, they won't know. Hurry up, it's started. What the hell are you doling? Come on. I'll be in the living room. I'll show you. You've never seen this before. Sit down. Ready? What Is it? It's a blue mole. It's okay, Laid, it's normal. Everyone watches here. Look at the man and lady. That's how you make babies. Only not so raunchy. One day, we'll go and see some women if you want, real ones. What's up? You were crying, calling for your Dad. Was It a nightmare? I like you, y'know. Don't worry, there's no bombs and wars here. You'll soon forget everything'. You'll have great dreams full of rappers, cute chicks and skateboards. Don't tell Khadidja. No way, you're my pal. Want a ciggy? I stole them from Mokhtar. What's a ciggy? A smoke, like! Isn't It ever warm here? Sure It Is, really hot in summer. That's in a few months. Once I get out of here, I'll show you some great things. We'll go skateboarding' and have burgers... They're great, you'll see. We can play all my video games. Come on, it's freezing'. I'll Introduce you to my pals. You'll make 'em laugh. Okay now? Excuse me. Put the stone here, spin It like this... Then sling It out. Radical! It's like the kids in Palestine fighting the Jews on TV. Can I try? Whose side are you on? The kids. They're Arabs like us. But I don't hate anyone, except Le Pen and skinheads. Fuck, I'm useless. Who are Le Pen and skinheads? Fascists. Racists. They hate Arabs and want us out of France. Jews, you mean. No, they hate them too. They're just shitheads. Show me the sling again. See the gate? I'll halt It in the middle. What's blondie want? I'm taking Laid. I'll stay out here. We'll be back. Do you like Karim? No. Ready in the morning? No problem. I'll pay now. 750 francs, please. Sorry... How did you get here? You shouldn't have. I wanted to stay with you. Let's halt the town. You did my knee In! Let's go back. Fuck you, you've hurt me. I'm not going back! Come on, Hans will worry. Screw him! I'm going back. Which way's the store? I know. Follow me. I want to eat something first. We can't... Sure we can, don't worry. You're too obedient. Relax, we'll hang out and then go back. They'll yell but just Ignore them. Like with my old man. You can't understand. Out It out! Eat your cheeseburger. It's gross when it's cold. It's neat, huh? Then we'll go and see Isabelle, my chick. No, we're going back. Come on, you have to meet her. I'll marry her one day. You're too young for a woman. - How old Is she? - 16. It's okay if we love one another. Hey! No smoking! You're too young! Get lost, you're not my dad! Screw that, It doesn't say. Get the hell out! Excuse us, we're going. Let go of me! Let go! Get your fucking hands off! Hands off, I sold. Shithead! Don't come back! Motherfucker! Karim, that's enough now. Take me back. Okay, get on the board. Sit down on the end. Trust me, okay? We're in no hurry now. They're gonna yell at us anyway. I'll show you some pros. These chicks are something'! What the hell are you doling? I'll show you! You too. I'll kick your ass. I'll tell your mom! Damn kids... I n the hall now! What do the parents teach them? What else Is new? Pay for the chocolate, I'll get the rest. Okay, but then we go. N Ice and quiet. I'll show you what class Is. A bar of chocolate? Sure you don't want to try it? It makes you dizzy but it's wild! What does being a child mean? I dunno. Doin' what you want. Just imagine it and it happens. Old people don't imagine. I don't get it. You little shits! Let's go back. We'll call everything off. You contact Beirut, and I'll handle Teheran. Hello. We halt the town. Get to your room, now! Sit down. I'm listening. Karim was there. I saw him run off. The only way was to catch him and bring him back. I jumped him, and he hurt himself as he fell. Then we lost our way but came right back as soon as we found it. We didn?t meet anyone. It's not Karim?s fault. He knows nothing. He followed me for fun. Don't worry. I respected my mission to the letter. I hope that's true. Why would I lie? Okay, Djilail, you've worked well. Leave your shit here, and go up. What do we do? We've got no choice. Your nightmares are wild! Calm down. I lied. I didn?t tell them about today. You're a real pal. You never pray? Don't you believe in God? Who knows. it's a pain in the neck. My mother believes all that. Have you learned the Koran? No, have you? I know It by heart. Okay, but maybe you just think you believe in God. You're my pal, even if we don't believe the same things. Let's make a pact. For better, for worse. What's that? A deal between us two. We swap something'. Our watches! Friends for better, for worse. If one's in trouble, the other helps. You're my friend for good? Right. Gimme your watch. The strap's fucked but doin' it's what counts. For better, for worse. You say it. Laid! This Is no time to sleep! Remember your training. Come on. Move! - Remember you have a mission. - I'm ready. It's time for you to become a hero. Your target. There'll be a crowd there, manly children. It's a party, with a Christmas tree, food and gifts. He'll shake everyone's hand. When he gets to you, start firing. And then? Empty the magazine. Don't count the shots. All 6 bullets. You arm will follow his body as It falls. I know. And then? Drop the gun, scream like the others, and run. Everyone will panic. Run out at the back, through the veranda windows. Run quickly to the gate. We'll be there. Will they shoot? They don't shoot children here. And then? Two hours later, we leave France. Tomorrow, Lebanon... for a hero's welcome. Why kill this man? He's their leader, the French president. An imperialist. A Satan. His policy is bad. He's with the Zionists. Once he's dead, they'll give In. Our Arab brothers will be freed. Karim? Once it's over, he can go. He'll talk. It's okay. We'll be long gone. Forget him now. Do your duty. Get dressed. I'll hand you over to a man who'll take you there. He Isn't in on this. Say nothing. He thinks you're stealing papers. If they find the gun? They won't, it's a party. They trust children and don't search employees. Your driver works there. They know him. They'll only want your I D card. This Is Karim?s. We changed the photo. If they ask, answer like Karim. You're Karim, you're in his shoes. Can I say good-bye? I won't see him again. - I need to pee. - Don't be long. I'll be outside. H hurry. Goodbye, Laid. Goodbye. For better, for worse. Karim? Once it's over, he can go. You're a real pal. If one's in trouble, the other helps. My watch! Djilail, come back! He'll do something stupid. He's upstairs. Don't hurt him. Move! Are you okay? Mokhtar killed him. Karim?s dead. We had no choice. It was too risky. Do your mission. Forget him. Your father died for our cause. Go. Quick! The knife... He wanted to kill me. The knife... Put a jacket on. Move, we've got to go. Come downstairs. I promise they're dead. There's a way out. Help me! Let go of me! You wanted to kill me! Come on, I saved your life! Nothing was supposed to happen to you. I didn?t know they wanted to kill you. I remembered their lies. They tricked me. Let go, that hurts. They tricked you too. They weren't policemen. I'm a soldier, sent here to kill the president. Are you a terrorist? No, a fighter. A traitor. I don't give a shit! I don't get any of this. Your father knew. He was taking me to the president. They didn't turn up. We've lost our son. I'm coming home. We'll call an officer at the Elysee. I'm on my way home. What's up? You can't leave me. For better, for worse, you sold. Come with me. Is this yours? - Whose Is it? - I don't know. Is It yours? Driver, there's a strange package! Driver! It's mine. Thank God. You sold it, lady. My name's not Laid. It's Djilail. Karim. My son! You sold me! They wanted to kill me! Stop it! Leave him! Who are you? He saved my life. We're leaving for good! Don't act so stupid. We didn?t know. You're too young for a gun. Keep back! He's dangerous. The cops are coming. Quick, get on the balcony. Onto the balcony! Move! C?mon, I know a held-out. Hope her mom's out. Are you alone? When's your mom back? Tomorrow. She's been gone 2 days. Good! The pigs are at my place. We'll be okay here. This Is my fianc?e, Isabelle. This Is my best pal. He's armed but he's okay. For an armed guy, he looks rough. Lie down, if you're slick. The law won't come here. The police. Some words he doesn't know. Come to the bedroom. It's okay, guys, I'll keep a look-out. What's up? I don't want to die. You're not going to. You're safe. No one knows you're here. It's over, Karim. I'm finished. They're all after me. I'll never get back to Lebanon. I'm here! I'm scared. I don't know how we'll manage, but I swear we'll leave for Lebanon tomorrow. Hey, guys... Nothing here. We'll carry on checking. Come on through, girls. Thanks, officer. Shit, held me, I know him. Seen him before? Somewhere, yeah. Hey, stop nudging' me! You stood on my foot! We'll go to the station and get a train to Marseilles. We'll stow away on a cargo ship, nice and quiet, and held until Lebanon. I saw that in a mole. Yeah? You bet! I'd like to take Isabelle... Merry Christmas! Clear off, squirts. Yeah, piss off. Get lost... Ragheads have kids now! Don't stay here! They're with you? Like niggers, too, or just ragheads? Hey, shithead, this Is Paris, not Bab-el-Oued. It's for real! Go on, piss off! I've had enough! Enough! Leave me alone! Okay, keep your hair on, we'll go. Okay... Motherfucking assholes! Your sister sucks! C?mon or we'll miss the last train. I'm going home. C?mon, just to the station. Okay, guys, let's go. I bet we'll get her to Lebanon. This train is about to leave. The Marseilles train is leaving from track 18. There! When's the next train for Marseilles? It just left. Walt till tomorrow morning, 7:12 a.m. Let's sit down. We'll leave in the morning. It's never cold in my country. The sun always shines. There's the sea, the sand and the silence. I feel uneasy. I'm too far from home. I've had enough, Karim. I want to go back to Lebanon. You can't tonight. Tomorrow... I can't breathe here. U understand? There are no stars in the sky here. Close your eyes. Imagine... The sun's shining, burning your skin. And the sand... You can smell it. As far as the eye can see. There's the sea... it's really rough. We can paddle if you want. Wow, it's cold. That's good in this heat. Now let the night fall. Can you see the stars? I never saw so many. Lie down on the sand and watch them shine. Go to sleep now. Everything?s peaceful. THE END
