As long as rabbits don't have historians, history will be written by the hunters. Hunters tell stories of victory and of war, which alas need to be fought in order to defend the weak and the helpless. The hunters are only doing their duty for the people, for democracy, for God and country in the name of civilization. Fighting against the bad guys, be they fascists, Communists, terrorists, et cetera, et cetera. But the story that hunters prefer to tell is no story at all. Aside from their credit card numbers, rabbits really don't need to remember anything else. In a few moments, this American B-17 is going to bomb Royan, a small French city on the Atlantic coast. Today is April 15, 1945. The war in Europe is over or almost. The bombardier on board of this B-17 is 23-year old Lieutenant Howard Zinn. He enlisted to fight for his country and against fascism. He is about to discover that his plane is going to drop a new type of bomb, napalm. The mission over Royan will change the course of his life. Looking down from above, Howard Zinn is certain that he is on the side of the good guys. But once he's landed, he'll realize that it's not just because you kill bad guys that you're a good guy. He'll land amongst those that can't be seen from above. This son of working class Jewish parents will become an historian. Howard Zinn will become the rabbits' historian, the historian of those who are on the wrong end of the gun. Because rabbits don't always run away. Sometimes they even take advantage of the hunters' inattention to grab their guns and force them to back up to the edge of the cliff and sometimes just a little further. ♪ As we go marching, marching ♪ We'll bring the bread to them ♪ The rising of the women ♪ Is the rising of the rest ♪ No more the drudge and idler ♪ 10 that toil where one reposes ♪ But the sharing of life's glories ♪ Bread and roses, bread and roses ♪ Bread and roses, bread and roses ♪ Our lives shall not be sweated ♪ From birth until life closes ♪ Hearts starve as well as bodies ♪ Bread and roses, bread and roses We grow up in a controlled society.

Howard Zinn, drawing on his own personal experience, will tell the story of those forgotten by history. He will take part in every major social struggle of his time, from the Civil Rights movement to the peace movement against the Vietnam War as well as the campaigns against the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. In 1980, Howard Zinn published his book A People's History of the United States which revealed chapters of history to the American public which they knew little or nothing about. The book was an enormous success. Over two million copies have been sold in the United States and it has been translated into languages worldwide. Howard Zinn died in 2010 but to this day, his ideas are still controversial. In 2012, his book was banned from public schools in Tucson, Arizona and in 2013, Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, President of of Purdue University, launched a crusade against teaching Zinn's book. Indiana Governor. Thank you. Let's not overdo it. What I'm doing here is to tell you something about how this came about. It all starts with a book, right? It starts with A People's History of the United States or maybe it starts with my wife Roslyn Zinn who wouldn't let me stop writing the book. That's what we're gonna use or try to use today and this is what they use in the United Nations and certain other governing bodies. His textbook is so refreshing to so many of my students because they are so used to learning about US history in a certain way. Learning about Christopher Columbus, he discovered America. You know, the Founding Fathers. But Howard Zinn brings forth a lot of the things that happened in the United States that aren't in your traditional textbook. It passes. There had been historians that had taken pieces of American history and dissected it but Zinn took the entire trajectory from the founding of the nation to the present and imploded that myth so that by the time you finished that book, you realized that all of the stories that we told ourselves about ourselves were not true. Howard Zinn would say that history is the memory of states and so what that means is that history is usually told from the standpoint of people who are in power and I think Howard Zinn brings to the plate, especially in American studies that it's important to have different standpoints of history told. When we organize with one another, when we get involved, when we stand up and speak out together, we can create a power no government can suppress, thank you. It's a really important book. It really changed the conscience of a generation in the United States. Here in Clishishua, a Paris suburb, Noam Chomsky talks about his friend Howard Zinn. On this side of the Atlantic today, the hegemony of the United States is taken for granted. - Up in the sky, look! - It's a bird. - It's a plane. - It's Superman! It's Superman. The United States' domination as a military, economic and cultural superpower is considered a completely natural phenomena. Disguised as a mild-mannered newspaper reporter, Clark Kent. There's no longer any debate over who's pro or anti-American. How did you come to think the way you do? I would like to know myself how come I am the man that I am. No, I think we all try to understand how we became what we are. We all try to figure out why we are thinking this way because sometimes we find that there are people who went through some of the same experiences and yet they think differently. But I'm sure that my growing up in a working class family of Jewish immigrants and seeing my mother and father work very hard, struggling and people around me also in my neighborhood working very hard, struggling. I'm sure that gave me a certain class consciousness. My father was from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. My mother came from Siberia and they came here and they met as factory workers in New York. Welcome to the land of liberty. Between 1900 and 1920, more than 14 million immigrants arrived in the United States. They came from all over Europe, from Russia, Ireland, Germany or like Howard Zinn's parents, from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. They came fleeing poverty or war or racism or religious persecution. They dreamed of a Promised Land of wealth or simply of a better life. The New World opens its arms wide to the poor and huddled masses of the Old. It's unwanted, it's fugitives, even a few Utopians. But above all, the rapidly expanding industries of the time require cheap labor. Men, women and children easy to exploit, easy to divide and easy to use against those damned worker's unions that demand to work less that 12 hours a day and their strikes that were ruining the country and prevented those who wanted to work from doing so. There were strikes and labor struggles all over the country. Even children protested. At the beginning of the 20th century, 300,000 children between the ages of 10 and 15 worked in mines, textile or other industries. In Philadelphia in 1903, children working 60 hour work weeks went on strike shouting "We want to go to school, 55 hours or nothing." I grew up experiencing the Depression in the early 1930s. My father was a waiter and there was less work for him when the economic crisis came, so he had to take different jobs. He worked as a window cleaner. He worked on the streets, selling neckties on the street. I would come home sometimes from school and I would find the house dark because we could not pay the electric bill. We lived in different places all the time because we could not pay the rents. The condition of my family was the way I experienced the economic crisis. I had no larger view of what was happening in the country or the world. I just saw what was happening right around me and right around me, I saw people struggling, people evicted from their homes, people without work. The Zinn family lived in rundown tenements in the slums of Brooklyn. The poor don't know how lucky they are. They don't have to spend years studying sociology to understand the world. A boy like Howard Zinn only needed to look at himself, the people around him and the people in his neighborhood and as his apartment was too dark and small, he often went outside to play ball, to take boxing lessons with the local champion and to see his friends. The advantage that the poor have over sociologists is that they know what they're talking about. As I was growing up and 17 years old and so on, I encountered these young radicals in my neighborhood. Probably young Communists in my neighborhood and they took me to this demonstration in Times Square and I didn't even know, I had never been to a demonstration. I wasn't even sure what the demonstration was about but there were all these people carrying signs, you see? And marching through Times Square and I saw the word "Peace, No War." That was okay and then when I heard the sirens, I thought oh there must be a fire somewhere around but it was the police and they were coming and they were going into the crowd and they were hitting people. They were on horses, some of them were on horses and they were knocking people down and then I was knocked unconscious. I woke up in a hallway who knows how much later and when I woke up, Times Square was totally as it was before the demonstration. It was as if nothing had happened. But the experience had a profound effect on my thinking because I suddenly realized that what these radical friends had been saying to me seemed to be true. The police were on the side of the Establishment and that there's no freedom of speech. I grew up with this naive idea that in America you can march through the streets, you can hold up signs. You can demonstrate peacefully because it was a peaceful demonstration and that is okay because this is a democracy and what I saw that night in Times Square said no, there's something wrong with that. At the age of 17 after getting hit over the head, Howard Zinn discovered the violence of social struggles hidden under the magic glitter of the American Dream, the dream that attracted millions of people from around the world. In the United States, there's never been a recognition of class conflict, class struggle. The culture and the dominant elites in the United States and the media, they've always succeeded in creating a kind of ideology of we are one happy family. We are, you know, the US Constitution starts off, "We the People." Of course it wasn't we the people who established the Constitution, it was 55 rich white men who established the Constitution and what all Americans learn, we were in a war against England for independence, that was the Revolutionary War, everybody was united. One, two, three. One, two, three. The United States which would become an empire sprung out of an empire. But as Howard Zinn says, the American Revolution wasn't unanimously supported. There were the Amerindians, the African-American slaves and freedmen, the poor, women and even amongst the revolutionaries, not everyone had the same idea. One, two, three, into the harbor! This small museum in Boston portrays one of the better known historic and heroic stories in the American Revolution, the Boston Tea Party of 1773 when the people rose to defy the English oppressor. All the people? Well almost. On the night of December 16th, 1773, people of Boston, in fact a group of just 60 patriots calling themselves the Sons of Liberty and disguised as Mohawk Indians, feathers and all, boarded three English ships moored in the harbor and tossed all the chests of tea overboard to protest against the taxes imposed by the English. A rebellion of colonists against the colonial power. For me this is actually the embodiment of what it means to be an American. What it takes for man to understand that God-given right to freedom and to liberty. I think that it often needs to be remembered that the tendency for governments and for those who rule people is to seek ever more and more power and the founding principle of this country is that people have their own power, they have their own right to govern themselves. Two centuries later, the name Tea Party has been appropriated by a political pressure group. Today's tea party opposes taxes and bureaucracy imposed by the Federal Government in Washington and has mobilized support in many parts of the United States. Essentially today's Tea Party advocates the rights of Americans to individual freedom unhindered by a large government. Do you see a link between the reenactment of what we just saw and today's Tea Party? Oh exactly, I just mentioned that to my wife. I said the things that they were talking about today are exactly what's going on right now. In fact there is an organization called the TEA Party. Taxed Enough Already, T-E-A and many of the participants in that strongly believe that the Federal Government here in the United States is much to big and is not following the Constitution. So you're saying that the British of the time are today's Washington? Correct, there are no more British today but there are too many people that do not believe in the principles upon which this country was founded and they believe that there needs to be more and more government to do more and more things. What the Tea Party believes is no. We believe in Constitutionally limited government. History can be considered as a collection of stories that we choose to light up like candles in order to illuminate the darkness of the present. But some people travel back into the past and never come back. 1775, the Battles of Lexington and Concord. A heroic moment for the Minutemen. Who were the Minutemen? Militias of patriots ready to mobilize at a moment's notice in case the enemy, that is to say the English attacked. With a Company coming back here... During the night of April 18th to 19th, 1775, they opened fire for the first time on English troops and the first shot fired here was described as "The shot heard around the world." The Minuteman in American history, he's iconic. The statue at the North Bridge of the Minuteman sums it up in terms of in one hand he has his musket and in the other his plow, he's ready to leave his, ready to pick up weapons to defend his land and his liberty. Yes, some were landowners, some were called mechanics. So they had a craft. We'll meet some of the people this evening. They were couriers, they worked in leathers. There was a tannery nearby. I think it's a great story. People who were here for 150 years and we were governing ourselves. We refused to be put under the control of another country and stood up for our rights and our freedoms and that's a lesson we still teach our children today. And they fought the British first at Lexington as they were heading out early in the morning at about dawn. The next fight was at the North Bridge at about 9:30 in the morning and the significance of the fighting at the North Bridge is it was the first time that the Colonial Militia and the Minutemen were ordered to fire on the King's soldiers, an act of treason known today as The Shot Heard Around the World. Make ready, prime and load. Shoulder up, fire lock. Make ready to prime and load, fire. That mostly everybody was united was untrue. Maybe 1/3 of the colonists were supporting the Revolution. They had to draft people to go into Washington's army and once they were in the army, the small farmers, the poor people who were in the army, when they saw what their conditions were, they rebelled. There were mutinies in the army of thousands of soldiers. George Washington ordered the execution of some of these mutineers, some of these rebels and these executions were carried out and we don't learn about that in the schools. And after the war, this class conflict continued because the veterans of the Revolutionary War who had been promised land for joining the army, they had little pieces of land, they were farmers and then they found that the taxes being levied on them by the rich who controlled the State Legislatures, they could not pay these taxes. So they were being evicted, their land and their farms being taken away from them and so they rebelled and there were rebellions in a number of states, in Massachusetts, in South Carolina. Rebellions, class conflict. In the United States, even a shoe shiner can become a millionaire. Propaganda has succeeded in purveying this belief. However the truth is as studies have shown for years that the poor in the US generally stay poor and the rich on the whole generally get richer and richer. It is a well established fact and everyone can see it but this fundamental belief is still conveyed in order to soften the brutal economic reality. The myth of the American Dream developed at the end of the 19th century, the age of railways, electricity, oil and telephones. The height of the Industrial Revolution. What historians usually forget to mention is that many of these fortunes were made with substantial government financing. Howard Zinn gives the example of the Union Pacific Railroad Company, which received 14 million acres of land and $27 million in Federal funding. This public generosity didn't benefit the workers who built the railroads, of which there were 10,000 Chinese and 3,000 Irish laborers. They laid over five miles of rail per day and died by the hundreds from exposure to heat or cold. In 1900, 1% of the US population owned 45% of the national wealth. This was the age of the robber barons, the superheroes of American Capitalism. Carnegie, Vanderbilt, JP Morgan, John Davison Rockefeller. Rockefeller possessed the largest fortune in history, up to $190 billion in today's dollars. That's three times Bill Gates' fortune and by what right? Divine right, natural selection. JD Rockefeller said it himself. "The growth of big business is merely the survival "of the fittest according to the laws of nature and God." His colleague Carnegie the steel magnate adds "Wealth when concentrated in the hands of a few "serves much more to the likes of progress than when it "is dissipated into salaries destined to feed the masses." As for Carnegie's associate Henry Clay Frick, he purportedly stated that "I can hire "one half of the working class to kill the other half." With labor unrest and thousands of strikes all over the US, he sees the rising tide of social conflict arriving on his doorstep and he doesn't like that at all. In 1892 in Homestead, Pennsylvania, he hired 300 agents of the Pinkerton Detective Agency to infiltrate demonstrations as agitators and break up strikes. Frick also had a company militia formed which on the night of July Fifth, 1892, opened fire on the strikers with machine guns, killing 16 people including one child. Alexander Berkman was a 22 year old Russian Jewish Libertarian Communist and the lover of the infamous Emma Goldman who the President later described as the most dangerous woman in America. To avenge the workers who were killed, Berkman pays a visit to Frick in his office and shoots him twice in the neck. Frick is seriously injured but a week later he returns to work. As for Berkman, he's sentenced to 22 years in prison. Like the other robber barons, Mr. Frick will be remembered as a patron of the arts and philanthropist, having collected paintings by Rembrandt, Renoir, Watteau and others. "My dear friends, you, the nouveau riche, "you've acquired your fortunes with the blood, "sweat and tears of the poor. "Yet you would prefer not to pay taxes? "In addition, you want to be loved? "No problem, setting up a foundation, "my wealthy friends, will allow you to conserve your wealth, "exempt you from taxes and allow you to "present yourselves as benefactors of humanity." In the superb Frick Collection in New York City, it is very unlikely that you will ever find Jacob Reese's photographs. Reese, a journalist and photographer, worked for the Popular Press in the 1880s and photographed the squalor of tenement living in New York. He portrayed how the other half lives, the other half being the poorer half of the population of New York City. Jacob Reese was one of the journalists that Theodore Roosevelt labeled muckrakers, those who denounced corruption and violence and the criminal practices of the all-powerful trusts in the rail, meat and steel industries. How many people living in Chicago today know of the events that took place in May 1886, the labor struggle and the fierce combat that raged here for days? For Howard Zinn, an essential chapter in labor history was written here with consequences for workers all over the world. Here we are in Haymarket Square with Tim Yeager, union organizer with the UAW and Matt Machowski of the IWW of Chicago. We owe Labor Day, May First to events that happened in Haymarket Square, which has since become a parking lot, and the eight hour work day, both of which benefit workers all over the world and who surely know nothing of what occurred here in Chicago. On May First, 1886, one of the largest demonstrations was here in Chicago. The purpose of the nationwide series of strikes was to show support for the eight hour day. At the end of the 19th century, the average work day was 10 to 12 hours, six days a week. In 1886, the movement for an eight hour work day spread across the country. On May Third during a demonstration in front of the McCormick Factories, the police fired into the crowd. Four workers were killed and several others wounded. The next day, May Fourth, the anarcho-syndicalist unions immediately called for a demonstration right here in Haymarket Square. It was a sunny day and Lucy and Albert Parsons had their children with them and people marched in their best clothing. The police, under orders of the captains of industry, looked for an opportunity to attack the parade. Around the country some of the demonstrations were attacked by police. Here in Chicago they looked for an opportunity but there was good discipline, good order. There was no opportunity given and so it was a successful day. They moved the crowd from there up to this area just north of this alley here and they hauled a hay wagon up and the speaker stood on the hay wagon. At the end of the demonstration, someone threw a stick of dynamite at the police. Eight policemen were killed in the explosion and more than 60 others were wounded. The police open fired on the crowd, killing several demonstrators and wounding at least 200. Who threw the dynamite? No one ever knew. Some suspect it was a deliberate provocation carried out by the Pinkerton Detective Agency, employing more than 10,000 agents for their business and industrial clients. Their agents would infiltrate labor movements, act as police informers and incite acts of violence. This became the excuse for a nationwide assault on the labor movement. Yes. Here in Chicago, the police raided labor union offices. They attacked and beat people who were still on strike for the eight hour day. The police, unable to find the real culprits, arrested union organizers. There was no evidence brought against any of them. The trial was a mockery of justice. The union men were evidently sentenced to death for their ideas. One of them, Louis Lingg, committed suicide in prison by setting off a stick of dynamite in his mouth. He was 21 years old. There was a show trial where their writings for the labor movement and about anarchy were used against them. Were the executions public? It was by invitation and the people who were invited were the captains of industry, the well-to-do. The McCormick family was invited, who had owned the newspaper which is now the Chicago Tribune and a sympathetic reporter asked one of the attendees why he had come to the execution and he said "I have come to watch the death of the labor movement." Four of the union men were hung on November 11th, 1887. August Spies, Albert Parsons, Adolf Fischer, George Engel. These events had repercussions worldwide. In Paris, the French decided that May First should be a day of action in favor of the eight hour workday. A fight for recognition of people's right to a life outside of the workplace. But it wasn't until May 23rd, 1919 after four years of sacrifice in the trenches that the French workers obtained an eight hour day and May First became a public holiday. In 1893, the Haymarket murders were pardoned by the progressive Governor of Illinois, John P. Altgeld and the three remaining union men were released from prison. He said let's forget it. At this point let us pardon these three men and let them live out their life. On the gallows with a noose around his neck, August Spies, one of the martyrs declares "The time will come when our silence will be more "powerful than the voices that you are strangling today." Not far from this monument in the Forest Park Cemetery just outside of Chicago lies Emma Goldman, one of Howard Zinn's heroines, buried among other famous labor activists. She was an anarchist, a feminist, a labor organizer and she was imprisoned many times and she opposed war and she became famous as a speaker all over the country. Finally during World War One, because she opposed World War One, she was put in jail and then after the war, she was deported, sent back to her homeland to Russia. Emma Goldman arrived in the US in 1885 at the age of 16 and participated in a large number of political, social and labor struggles, particularly for women's rights. She was imprisoned on several occasions for pacifist opinions, inciting people to riot and defending birth control. She even had her own newspaper, Mother Earth. In 1921, she wrote extensively to explain her disillusionment with the Russian Revolution. In 1936, she went to Spain to support the Republican cause. She died in 1939 in Toronto and asked to be buried here in Chicago next to the Haymarket martyrs. Look, there's Emma Goldman's grave. It's dressed with flowers and there are stones placed on her tombstone as according to the Jewish tradition and that guy there, he's a member of the IWW who came all the way from St. Louis to pay tribute to her. He has left a button from his union as well as an apple. You see the red apple? It was in his bag. The apple came all the way from St. Louis. In memory of Emma Goldman. "Liberty doesn't descend to a people, "a people must raise themselves to liberty." The news of the Haymarket Massacre changed Emma Goldman's life forever and the lives of many activists of her generation. Howard Zinn, optimistic as usual in his analyses, believes that social conflicts like these no matter how dramatic contribute to understanding history and the education of following generations. For Zinn, this is how class struggle and the movement for social progress move forward. ♪ As we go marching, marching ♪ In the beauty of the day ♪ A million darkened kitchens ♪ A thousand mill lofts gray ♪ Are touched with all the radiance ♪ That a silent sun discloses ♪ For the people hear us singing ♪ Bread and roses, bread and roses ♪ As we go marching, marching ♪ We battle too for men ♪ For they are women's children ♪ And we honor them again Bread and roses.

Sometimes a song suffices to keep an event alive despite the passage of time. ♪ Give us bread but give us roses In his People's History of the United States, Howard Zinn relates the episode of the 1912 textile strike of the men and women working in the mills of Lawrence, Massachusetts. The story of bread and roses. 1912, Lawrence Massachusetts was an unusual event in the history of labor struggles in the United States. Unusual because it followed a whole series of strikes and struggles which were lost by the workers. In Lawrence, Massachusetts, the workers won their strike even though the workers were poor immigrants, women and divided by a dozen languages. But they were helped by the labor union IWW, Industrial Workers of the World which believed in bringing all workers together. In 1905 in Chicago, a group of anarchist and socialist union organizers created the IWW, Industrial Workers of the World. One of the founding members of the IWW was Mary Harris Jones, better known as Mother Jones. She participated in many minor strikes. She supported women who resisted when strike breakers were called in. She aided children exploited in factories and organized large demonstrations in which they marched up to the homes of the great Puritan bourgeois families that employed them. Eugene Debs was another founding member of the IWW. In 1894 he was thrown into prison for his participation in a strike against the Pearlman Wagon Factory. Debs ran for President of the United States several times. Big Bill Haywood was another founding member. He was dreaded by all the bosses of his time, particularly those of the silver mines as he was head of the union. At the first ever IWW meeting, he addressed the assembly. "Comrades, we are here to confederate the workers "of this country into a working class movement "of which the purpose is to emancipate the "working class from the slavery of Capitalism." The IWW was also the hobo's union, itinerant farm workers who were low cost travelers. During the massive strikes in Lawrence in 1912, the Industrial Workers of the World totaled 50,000 members. They were called the Wobblies. This is the Lawrence industrial zone one century later. Cotton produced by slaves in the South arrived by this river to be processed by wage slaves of the North in one of the 34 buildings of the American Woolen Company. In 1912, this factory was one of the biggest in the world. It employed 30,000 workers, mostly women who came from 25 different European countries. They all came with the hopes of a better life. They all came with the belief in the American Dream. Much to our surprise, here in the middle of these abandoned buildings is a small, little-visited museum run by Jim Boshen. - Is that where they worked? - Yes. The mills right across the canal from us were all textile mills and at the height of the industry in Lawrence which is around the time of the strike, over 30,000 people worked in the textile mills here. Hard work in Tough conditions. The mills were hot and loud, dusty. A lot of dangerous machinery close by. These were all textile mills. It had begun primarily for cotton textiles, by the turn of the century, mostly woolen. The mills in the North had a very close, interdependent relationship with the Southern plantations. In the cotton fields of the South, African-Americans were exploited and here in the North, immigrants were exploited. Very much so and those comparisons were made at the time. It was something that defenders of slavery in the South would point to and say how can you criticize us? You're exploiting the immigrants in the North. Well the first wave of immigrants to Lawrence was the Irish escaping the Irish Potato Famine in the late 1840s. Then many waves of immigrants followed, including many of my ancestors who were French-Canadians from Quebec. Saw a huge influx of immigrants during the late 19th and early 20th century. The famous massive wave from southern and eastern Europe, many of whom went through Ellis Island in New York. The workers' nine dollar a week salary was just enough for them to buy food and pay their rent, which naturally was owed to their employers. One study conducted at the time estimated an infant mortality rate of 50% for children under six. In Lawrence starting in 1911, the factory owners decided to put the ideas of Frederick Taylor into practice. Skilled workers were no longer required. Gains in productivity and in competitivity were achieved by speeding up production. No one is irreplaceable. However in 1912, a Federal law was passed limiting the work week for women and children to 54 hours instead of 56, two hours less work for the same wages. But at the end of January when the workers received their pay, they found that their meager raise hadn't been granted. The two hours less work had been deducted from their pay. This set off an immediate strike. In just a few days, the number of striking workers went from 1,000 to 5,000 and then to 10,000. ♪ The freaks and fools are apt ♪ To trod in burdens all the time ♪ What we want to see ♪ What I need is a good old picket line Of the small number of members they had here when the strike broke out, most of whom were Italian immigrants by the way who had brought some of their radical political philosophies with them. The IWW sent in organizers to aid the striking workers. The best known were Arturo Giovannitti and Joseph Ettor. Both of them were young, Joseph was 27. He could speak Italian, Polish, Hungarian and Yiddish. Across the canal from us right now is part of the Pacific Mills which was another one of the very large textile companies in Lawrence at that time and this is the site of one of the famous episodes early in the strike. This bridge across the canal there is where the marching strikers were hosed with water from the fire hoses from, and of course this was during a very cold winter, so the water would be freezing on their backs. There were strikes all over the country at the time but this one became a legend. The mill owners and city officials began to panic as did the clergy and other local business leaders. The Governor called out the local militia, then the National Guard. So during one of the confrontations between strikers and police at the intersection at the far end of the mill, a young Italian woman named Anna LoPizzo was hit by a shot and fell and died. Ettor and Giovannitti were arrested and charged as accessories to murder, to the murder of Anna LoPizzo even though they were nowhere near the scene on the theory that they had encouraged people to protest in the streets and that led to the shooting. Let's start walking back this way. The winter of 1912 was cold and hard and the strikers started running out of food. The welfare of the strikers' children was at stake but a show of solidarity occurred. 400 families around the country volunteered to take in their children. Yeah, the strike became a national and international cause celebre. You did have the transport of children of strikers to live with sympathizers in other cities. And they were helped by the solidarity of the Socialist movement because when they were starving in this winter of the strike and did not have enough food for their children, the Socialist newspapers advertised for families that would take care of the children of Lawrence and that enabled them to continue the strike. On February 10th, 1912, 119 children left Lawrence for New York City. They were met by union workers singing the revolutionary songs The Internationale and the Marseillaise. In Lawrence, the repression had been so violent that a special Congressional Committee was appointed. The testimony of Camilla, a 12 year old girl whose scalp had been torn off working at a spinning machine helped lead to a resolution of the strike. ♪ As we come marching, marching ♪ Un-numbered women dead The stories of these struggles are not told in American schools or in American textbooks. Most Americans, even workers today have never learned that history. For instance I was in Lawrence, Massachusetts a few years ago. I found that the people in Lawrence, Massachusetts did not know about the history of that strike. That's why I considered it very important in my book to tell the story of these labor struggles in American history. Why did you become interested in this story? My personal family history as I mentioned was a grandfather who kept out of it, stayed away. Is there anyone here who could still sing the song? Okay.

She told us about the 1909 woolworkers strike in the mills of Masame and Graulhet. The strike in Graulhet lasted 147 days. The workers were predominately women who were paid only half as much as men. They worked with toxic substances in foul-smelling workshops. So they went on strike. The strike was long and food ran out. They invented Communist soup kitchens in Graulhet and the workers' children were lodged by families all over France. The same type of solidarity that was shown for the children of Lawrence. In England, France, Germany as well as in the United States, we share a common history with the Industrial Revolution. The same causes produced the same effects, the same suffering and the same resistance. But there were other forms of resistance and innovative opposition. We're here with Noam Chomsky at MIT in Boston. This region where we are now are the origins of the Industrial Revolution. There is a rich literature from the mid-19th century by working people, people working in the textile mills and artisans and others. They had their own newspapers, they were running them. They were eloquent and had very interesting material in them. There was no European influence. This was just developed indigenously. They bitterly condemned the industrial system which they said was crushing them, taking away their culture, their dignity, their freedom. They said that people who work in the mills should own them. They opposed wage labor as an attack on elementary integrity and those views were very widely accepted. For example Abraham Lincoln described wage labor as not very different from slavery. That the only difference is with wage labor, it's not permanent, with slavery it's permanent. It's taken a lot of effort to drive these thoughts out of people's minds because those are very natural ideas. In fact if you look back at the United States, the United States had a very violent labor history, much more so than Europe. Hundreds of American workers were being killed when nobody was being killed in Europe and when there were developments of socialism and democracy, they were crushed by force. Crushed revolts and forgotten victories. If the modest success in Lawrence had been forgotten by history, it's because for the ruling class, it set a very bad example. The Rockefeller family doctrine is "Don't let them think that revolt can succeed." JD Rockefeller Jr., who had Rockefeller Center in New York City built would get a chance to apply this principle in Ludlow, Colorado in 1914. There, a coal miners strike was ruthlessly repressed. When Howard Zinn started studying history, he began with research on the Ludlow Massacre. 1914, Ludlow, Colorado. 11,000 coal miners worked here for JD Rockefeller Jr. Immigrants of all different origins, Greeks, Italians, Serbs as well as African-Americans. The work was dangerous and the wages were low. The miners decided to organize, hoping to obtain better working conditions but a union representative was shot down by the company's militia. So the miners went on strike. They received a visit from Mother Jones. At 80 years old, she was wanted by police all over the US but she was able to arrive secretly at Ludlow. She aided the strikers until she was arrested, imprisoned and thrown out of the state of Colorado. Then Rockefeller hired a private militia. They were armed with rifles and machine guns. The Colorado National Guard was then called in. When they arrived in Ludlow, the miners showed relief because they thought that the National Guard had come to their rescue. Despite the bitter cold and the snow, the miners greeted the soldiers with flag-waving and shouts of joy but then the National Guard maneuvered towards them and charged against the miners, women and children. The miners resisted, digging foxholes and trenches in order to defend themselves. Then one day, management offered to negotiate but when the union representative arrived for discussions, he was shot down in cold blood by Rockefeller's hired guns. That evening the National Guard charged once again and burned down the miners' camp. The Governor had ordered the soldiers to open fire. 13 people were killed. At dawn the next morning, the shriveled, burned corpses of 11 children and two women were found under a metal plate covering a ditch. The miners union sent out a call for help. 300 miners arrived in Ludlow from other nearby mines, cutting telegraph and telephone wires on the way and ready to fight. In solidarity with the miners, train conductors refused to transport troops and even certain Guardsmen refused to go to Ludlow. Armed miners counterattacked. They destroyed all they could and blew up several mine shafts. Other unions in the country sent armed workers as reinforcements. There were demonstrations and meetings of support all over the country and even as far away as New York. The New York Times called on the President to take firm action against the strikers. Finally President Wilson sent in the US Army. The 14 month struggle left 66 people dead and many more wounded and for what reason? Because of Rockefeller's sacrosanct principle, don't let them believe that revolt can succeed. The repression of the IWW became increasingly violent. The Wobbly leaders were harassed and killed. One of their most famous figureheads was Joe Hill, the singer-songwriter of protest songs. In November 1915 in Salt Lake City, Joe Hill was accused of murdering a grocery store owner during a robbery. No evidence was ever brought against him. He was sentenced to death by a firing squad despite protests from all over the world. Before he was executed, Joe Hill wrote "I die like a true blue rebel. "Don't waste any time mourning, organize." ♪ Don't mourn, oh no ♪ Don't mourn, no no ♪ Don't mourn, oh no ♪ Don't mourn, no no ♪ Don't mourn, oh no no no ♪ Don't mourn, organize "My body, ah if I could choose, "I would to ashes it reduce and let the merry "breezes blow my dust to where some flowers grow. "Perhaps some fading flower then "would come to life and bloom again. "This is my last and final will. "Good luck to all of you, Joe Hill." His ashes were distributed in small envelopes and were scattered throughout the United States and other countries around the world. The Wobblies were provoked into violent reaction. Ferociously repressed and stigmatized, the union lost momentum and its popular support. The First World War would bring the final blow to the Wobblies and other progressive movements around the world. It's been historically true that when the government has been in trouble, it has used military action, intervention elsewhere as a way of trying to solve the domestic crisis, the economic crisis and this has happened at other times in American history and especially if there's a great opposition in the country which threatens the Establishment. One way of dealing with the opposition is by going to war and when you have a war atmosphere, you're in a position to suppress the opposition. That's what happened in the First World War. Before the First World War, there was a powerful Socialist movement in this country and a radical trade union movement, the IWW. But when the government went to war, when Wilson took us into the European war, it created an opportunity for him to crush the Socialist movement and the IWW. In 1914, while the miners were being shot down in Ludlow, the First World War broke out in Europe. The Battle of the Somme in July 1916 was one of the biggest military disasters in history. It was the first joint offensive by French and British troops. The battle was personally conducted by General Gough. On the first day, July First, the British Army commanded by General Haig lost over 20,000 soldiers with 40,000 more missing or wounded. 10,000 men were killed within the first hour. Nine million men in the prime of their lives died in the mud of the trenches, farmers, workers and others. Another 20 million more people died after the war from subsequent epidemics. France alone counted 1,400,000 killed or missing in action, 10% of the active male population. Three million were wounded in battle, of which 100,000 were mutilated, 42,000 blinded or visually impaired and 15,000 disfigured. In the United States as elsewhere, the war whetted the appetites of bankers and industrialists. The US economy was expanding rapidly in 1914 but it wasn't yet internationally dominant. The First World War helped it to consolidate while in the meantime weakening its competitors. With the conquest of new markets abroad, the US was soon in a position to crush its rivals. In the US, savvy businessmen know that it is better to sell shovels to prospectors than to dig for gold oneself. Two billion dollars worth of material had already been sold to their allies before they entered the war in 1917. In the French paper Les Annales, the journalist Cami Fari Pisane quotes an important and influential American banker in his article on March 25th, 1917. "The war enabled us to quintuple our profits. "We got rich by providing cotton, "wool, "meat, "steel, artillery shells, "wheat, leather, "shoes, machine guns, "horses and automobiles. "Anything we could sell, you bought. "You paid with gold, with paper currency, "with bonds and with loans. "So you must win the war at all "costs in order to pay us back. "Then the money we have made by these sales will be "lent to you again to rebuild your cities and factories. "But we will only profit if you win. "That is why we want you to win rapidly." The sinking of the ocean liner Lusitania by a German submarine on May Seventh, 1915 offered the United States the pretext they needed to enter the war. The incident was presented to the American public as a war crime and became a major argument in persuading the US to go to war against Germany. The Germans claimed that the ship was transporting munitions for the Allies. This claim that the Lusitania was carrying American ammunitions was confirmed by historians years later in 1972. President Woodrow Wilson declared that "Some countries are simply too proud to fight." But he swallowed his pride and led the US into the war in April 1917. He then asserted that the United States should be willing to sacrifice lives in the name of its founding principles. The President was more discrete about the two billion dollars lent to the Allies, a debt that would never be repayed if the Germans with their submarines won the war. In 1917, the war led to the Revolution in Russia. 10 days that shook the world. It was a new feeling that the oppressed, the downtrodden could make the world a better place. Russia pulled out of the war, thus freeing up the German Army in the east and putting a possible victory within their grasp. The United States had no choice but to intervene in order to protect their best interests. But fighting a war in faraway Europe was an idea that would have to be sold to the American public. Despite the indignation provoked by the sinking of the Lusitania, most young Americans weren't ready to die overseas for a matter of principles. In order to convince them, President Wilson made eloquent speeches. He spoke about "a war to end all wars" and "making the world safe for democracy." Out of four million American soldiers mobilized, two million were sent to the front. 116,000 of them would never return. In this elementary school in Chicago, you see children throwing down German books in front of the camera. The journalist George Creel became the official Head of Propaganda for the Committee on Public Information. He launched the operation 4 Minute Men. It consisted in sending out accomplished public speakers ready to intervene anywhere at a moment's notice to make persuasive four minute speeches. Creel mobilized 75,000 orators who made 750,000 speeches in over 5,000 towns and cities across the US to convince the public. This is Douglas Fairbanks. This is Charlie Chaplin. Charlie Chaplin was called into service to sell Liberty Bonds in order to support the war effort. "I want you for US Army." Despite the unprecedented propaganda, very few young people in the US volunteered and recruitment was disappointing. So the government decided to institute the draft. The opposition to the war had to be silenced. The Espionage Act, a law ostensibly against espionage enabled the authorities to imprison anyone who wrote or spoke against the war for up to 20 years. Union activists were the first victims. Emma Goldman, Zinn's heroine took part in antiwar meetings all over the country and helped organize the No Conscription League to oppose the draft. She and her companion Alexander Berkman were arrested. They were then imprisoned on Ellis Island and deported back to Russia, their country of origin on December 21st, 1919. Socialist Leader Eugene Debs would also be silenced by the Espionage Act. His political career was brought to a halt in June 1918. He was arrested in Canton, Ohio after giving an antiwar speech to an audience that included young men of draft age. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison for obstructing the Recruitment and Enlistment Service. But Debs ran for President in 1920 from his prison cell and received almost a million votes. Chris Hedges is a journalist, Pulitzer Prize winner and a former War Correspondent for the New York Times. He ended up resigning from the paper because he didn't agree with their editorial policy. He has investigated the part played by the elites during the First World War and the role of George Creel, the chief organizer of war propaganda. Creel was created to destroy Debs and what was created, and I take this from Dwight Macdonald's observation is the imposition of the psychosis of permanent war. You are constantly keeping a population in fear and in the name of the war on Communism, you destroy your populist and your radical movements and disembowel your liberal class. You re saying that in 1917, that's when propaganda was invented, when modern advertising was invented. Yes because it was the first system of modern mass propaganda because it employed the understanding of crowd psychology pioneered by Le Bon, Trotter, Freud which grasped that people were moved not by fact or reason but by the skillful manipulation of emotion and that system of mass propaganda is the model that Goebbels uses when he creates the Nazi propaganda machine. And quite specifically Bernays' book Propaganda and when you read the great radical thinkers of the period, Randolph Bourne or Jane Addams, they despair that not only have the masses been seduced by this propaganda but most of the intellectual elite as well. So the moment the war is over, that entire machinery which was massive goes to Madison Avenue and starts working on behalf of corporations. That's when you overturn traditional values of thrift, self-effacement and you replace them with consumption as a kind of inner compulsion and the cult of the self. 1917 is also the year of the Russian Revolution and you're saying they went from the Kraut to the Commie. Yes and of course, that is correct. That instantly the dreaded Hun becomes the dreaded Red and the way they do it is to claim that the Germans, the Kaiser was behind Lenin's arrival because the train was allowed passage through Germany from Switzerland and so the ruling elite recognizes that that apparatus of propaganda, fear and permanent war is one that can keep them in power which is why the moment the Cold War is over, we begin the War on Terror because it serves the same purpose. And they recognize that if they perpetuate that propaganda, that fear and permanent war, they can get the masses to call for their own enslavement which is precisely what's happened. Go right. Halt. Left, left, go left, right, go left. Thank you very much, you have a good parade, thank you. They manufactured a will of the people for a very short time right after the war started as governments are able to do right after the beginning of an armed conflict. They're able to create an atmosphere of war hysteria and so for a short time, they captivated the minds of the American people. Yeah. Our women are proud of us, yeah, that's right. The rabbits who didn't have historians and who knew nothing of their own history didn't say anything when the hunters arrived with their big guns. "We're here for your security," the hunters told them. "We're here to protect you from the terrorist rabbits, "from the Communist rabbits, from the Jewish rabbits, "from the Muslim rabbits, from the perverted rabbits, "from those who want to cook a rabbit stew." The terrified rabbits, paralyzed in the hunters' headlights, huddled together. "There's nothing to be afraid of," the hunters told them. "You'll be free once you're in the cages "and don't let our big guns scare you. "If you want peace, you must prepare war, "war against the bad guys, a just war. "War is peace."
