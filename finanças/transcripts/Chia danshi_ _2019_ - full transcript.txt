"Bando Dojo" Haruko Bando! "Bando Dojo" Yes! Hajime! Come on, Sis! Go for it! Ippon! Soremade! Next! Haru, you're next! Yes. Good luck, Haruki. Nice one, Haruko. Hajime! Move forward, Haruki! Pull hard! Waza-ari! Mate! - Are you OK? - Haruki? - Are you OK? - Haruki! Haruki! Someone get some ice! - Are you OK? - Ice! Ice! Haruki! "Meishiin University" Do your best, Ton-chan! You're so generous! Ow! Sorry! Watch out. Look where you're going! Sorry. Hurry up, Ton-chan! OK, let's start. Look! Girls! Cheerleaders! Go for it! - Shall I? - Chat 'em up! Running with 'em? For real? For real? One, two! One, two! Forget it! Keep it up, girls! Do your best! Tsunomori! Sorry I'm late! Hi, lacrosse team. Hi. We'll take the photos now. Someone gave me this. It's about a new club. "Male cheerleading"? Cheerleading's for girls! "Recruiting Male Cheerleaders" "Male..." "cheerleading"? Gran. Like them? Oh, this? I found it clearing out Mom and Dad's closet. How's it look? Wanna eat something? Your range of motion has increased. You just need follow-up examinations. I see. Thank you. Haru! I knew you by your walk! Kazu. Been to see your grandma? Yeah. Maybe I'll say hello. It's fine. Do it next time. Get on. Let's go to the dojo. Come on! How's your shoulder? Getting better. So you'll be back doing judo soon. Haru. You know, when I got injured in April, it was a relief. I didn't have to do judo, so I was free at last. I don't have skills like my big sister. Why was I born into a judo family? Haru. I'm gonna quit judo. What!? Be careful! But why? I wanna do something. Do something? That's... It's my club. I don't get what you're saying. The thing is, I wanna quit judo and start something new. - You can't quit! - Why not? Why not? We've always done it together. I'm gonna do this. Together with you! With me? Haru. Let's start something fun together! Kazu's gonna regret it, for sure. You can't be sure about that. It's a waste. He's done judo since he was a kid. Well, it's Kazu's decision, so we have to respect it. The thing is... Come on, eat up! For your shoulder. This was in my mom's room. One of her treasures. A bit of nostalgia. What is it? Is that your mom? Yeah. A cheerleader from high school until after graduating university. My dad used to be her coach. For real? Her cheerleading notebook. Her notebook? Here. "Let's go for it!" "Cheerleading"? "Stunting"? That's stunting. Wow! This is their first performance. Until her freshman year at university, her club had only 7 members. But my mom... always looked so happy when talking about those times. That's why I wanna do it. Male cheerleading! I want a 7-man team, but it's hard to get people to join. Oh. I need 5 more. You're counting me in? Why not? I can't just up and quit judo like you can! You know that. Haru. We aren't children anymore. We're free to choose what we wanna do. And... I think you'd be good at it. Me? Doing that? When we did judo, you always cheered me on. Yeah, but... it was just to feel useful. I never won bouts. Even so, feeling you were with me, like I wasn't alone. You always made me feel that. In fact, I owe a lot of my victories to you cheering me on. You have a talent for supporting others. Right now, I need your support. Male cheerleading! Wanna join the club? - Male cheerleading? - Yeah. Interested? Not really. But it's so cool! We aren't interested. Haru! Pass out more flyers. You haven't passed out any. Just getting warmed up! You do over there. The male cheerleading club. Male cheerleading? We've already joined the karate club. Sorry. I see. "Bando Dojo" "Haruki Bando" Hi. Hi. Wanna go running? No, I'm fine. You'll be weak when you start judo again. You know... Kazu's started a new club. I'm helping him out. Like... Kazu's wasting his life. So many students give up... what they've worked so hard on, and start something new. They end up never achieving anything. It'll amount to nothing. Cheer me at my bout, OK? OK. Male cheerleading. Hey! Wanna attempt something new? Thank you. Kazu! Look. Hey! I'm Kazuma Hashimoto, a freshman. Koji Tono, also a freshman. Interested? Yeah. Yeah! Fantastic! Here. Thanks. "Himawari" Thanks. Thanks for your regular custom! Do you think I can do it? I've always wanted to do a sport. You know, one day. But... But? I've hardly ever done sports, and with this figure... it's impossible, right? Figures don't matter. There's a role to suit your figure. Give it a try. - Welcome. - Take a seat. May I? Erm... I've been watching you hand out flyers. Since last week, I've wanted to talk. Your timing's terrible! "Opportunity knocks but once at your door." Nicolas Chamfort, a French moralist. My opportunity has knocked, so I've opened the door. I'm Wataru Mizoguchi. Hi, Kazu! Hi, Haru! You know our names? I've been eavesdropping on you. What!? Hi! I still haven't decided whether to join or not. Of course you'll join. All we need is... courage to open the door. I'm Koji Tono. Welcome to the club, "Ton"! "Ton"? Short for Tono. Don't like it? From Tono? Nobody's ever said that before! Who put you in charge? It's fine. Welcome! Ton, Mizoguchi. - OK! - Thanks! Hey, Haru! Me too? Come on! - Haru! - Haru. Right! We'll start with handstands! You can do it! Don't give up! Go on! Yeah! You can do it! A bit more! Come on! Yeah! You did 10 paces! Great! What? You... support as if you were doing it yourself. That's right! I told you. You think so? What's with that face? Look, they're here! No way! For real? Ton-chan's buddies! Handstand club! Do your best, yeah? We ain't a handstand club! Right, I'll be going now. OK. Do your best! Go for it! Try and slim down! Sorry I'm late. Those guys call you Ton too? I gave you that name. No, they call me that because of my figure. People've always called me that. Find better friends. But they talk to me. You say things like that so they look down on you. Don't hang with those guys. Have the guts to be alone! That's what I've done. Don't worry! You'll learn some amazing moves and knock their socks off. Yeah! Oh yeah! Just a moment ago... That group over there. - Go! Go! Go! - What, again? Give us a break! Wow! Those guys should be cheerleaders! Ichiro's gonna pitch! Ichiro! Ichiro! No way. They're way too superficial. So funny! Let's go. - Hey! - Kazu! Hey! Amazing backflips! Thanks! A stranger's praising us! Anyone can do it. But I can't, so I'm impressed! Really? I'm Kazuma Hashimoto, a freshman. We're freshmen too! I'm Ichiro and he's Gen. You're from Kansai? Is Kazu always like that? Yeah. I chose this university first. No, I was first! Hey, hey. Wanna start something fun with us? Male cheerleading? Your backflips are amazing! With us, you can put them to use. I want you to cheerlead with us. Kazu! - Kazu, Kazu! - What? Hey! What's all this? Tryin' to poach our members? Sorry! Let's go. Hey, wait. Hey! You. I'm talking to you, four-eyes! You're in my sociology of literature class. Always sitting alone! I knew it! You're a senior! Huh!? Tryin' to make your debut? You've never had friends! No, I... Impossible! It'll amount to nothing! Never achieve anything. It'll amount to nothing. You'll never change! Yes we will. We will! We might be able to. We wanna do this! We have the right to believe we can, and try! Shut up. Excuse me. What's with him? Take care on your way home! Yeah, say some more stuff! Hey you! Say something too! Hey, everyone! We're gonna do something fun, so please watch us! Over here! Watch us! Go on ahead. "Recruiting Male Cheerleaders" Haruki? OK! Everyone. Whatever happens, smile! Here we go! OK! OK! OK! Ready? Let's go! Meishiin! We're the male cheerleading club! Come and join us! Haru. We'd like to do a little show for you now. Louder! Let's go! Meishiin! Smile! Let's go! Meishiin! Let's go! Meishiin! Just look at 'em! Come on! Let's go! Meishiin! Everyone! Together! Bigger smiles! Let's go! Meishiin! Come on! Let's go! Meishiin! Let's go! Meishiin! Wanna join? Let's go! Meishiin! Let's jump! Let's go! Meishiin! Let's go! Meishiin! Handstands! Let's go! Meishiin! Let's go! Meishiin! Last one! Let's go! Meishiin! Let's go! Meishiin! Hey. Let's join 'em! It looks fun. Why not? Alright. That was great! - Amazing! - Oh, it's you! You were watching? You're crazy! Excuse me. We are the student union. Who's your leader? A permit is required for this kind of outdoor performance. But never mind that. Let's talk in our office. Oh no! You're in charge. Thank you! Yummy! Eat up! My head hurts! You're spilling it! First one to finish gets another one free! For real? Yeah, so eat up! Is it too heavy for you? Let me help. - Thanks, Mikuri! - Thanks! Have you two always done tennis? No, I always did baseball. We did it together, but I could never beat Ichiro, so I switched to soccer in high school. For real? Yeah, didn't you realize? - No. Why're you laughing? - It's funny! Welcome. Ichiro, Gen. Thanks! - Welcome! - Welcome! Welcome. What did the union lady want? She wants to write an article about us. That's what it was? She was really supportive. Wow! That's great! - And another thing. - What? The union has proposed... that we train together with the female cheerleading team! Yeah! They're so cute, right? Yeah. It's great to be young. Right? You aren't young anymore. I'm still young enough! In cheerleading, there are 3 positions: base, spotter, top. The bases of the stunt group... will be Ton and Ichiro. Come here. Ichiro-chan! Like in this picture, you two face each other. OK, Ton? OK! The spotter helps the bases and calls the timing of the stunt. That's you, Mizoguchi. I can do that! Mizoguchi! The spotter stands here and helps the bases. Do your best! Thanks, I will. And the top... stands on top and performs the stunt. The tops are Haru and Gen. I'm a top! I'm on top! What!? Drop me and I'll punch you! Punch me and I'll punch you back! Haru, you go first. Spotter, hold the top's waist. Bases, bend your knees. You're gonna be holding the soles of his feet. Are you OK? - No problem. - I'm fine. "One, two, down, up." That's the signal. The spotter is the playmaker who makes the call. I'm the playmaker? OK. Let's try it. OK, Mizoguchi? OK. Ready? - Nice one! - Great! Elevator! Ready? How do you feel? I feel fantastic! That's so cool! Yeah! Just a moment. Haruki! Bow to the dojo. I saw you guys. You do that, but not judo? Your shoulder's healed, hasn't it? So come and train. Haruki. I'm sorry, Sis. I'm gonna quit judo. I don't have the will to win like you. I blamed it on lack of training. But it isn't true. You what? I don't wanna defeat people. I wanna do things with them. I'm gonna do cheerleading. You can't. Dad won't permit it. I'll talk to him. I won't permit it. Put more spirit into it! Dad. Haruki, what's up? Sorry I'm late! Let's go. Kazu. I've quit judo. I told my mom and dad. And my sister. I've told them. Oh. Is that all you can say? They're so cute! Their club has the full support of the student union. Please support them too, Dreams. Nice to meet you! Attention! Bow! Nice to meet you! I'm Takagi, their coach. I'm Saeki, an alumna. Only 6 members? Yes, but we're looking for one more member to make it 7. Cheerleading with 7 guys? I've promised to train you, and I will, today. Right. A-team, show them how we do it. They're gonna show us! I'm looking forward to this! Not too bad. They're amazing! Look! Tumbling! Wow! Dreams is one of the top teams in the country! Look at that! OK! Wow! That's so cool! Fantastic! So freakin' cool! Assemble! Your feedback, please. Please, coach! The changeover wasn't coordinated enough. Next time, concentrate on making it look beautiful. Yes, coach! That's all for now. 1, 2, 3, break! Thank you! Shall we begin? - Yes. - Thank you! Let's show them! Bases, not like that! Grip the shoes more firmly! Straighten up! Look up, not down! You'll get the top's foot in your face! Use your arms for support, not the bases' hands! You're sinking. Don't you work out? You can do it! Again, from the mount. Ready? One, two, down, up. Bases, don't lean back! Get closer! Use your whole body! Top, straighten up! Don't slouch! Nice one! Spotter, give clear orders! It's dangerous if you don't! Speak up! Speak up! Yes, coach! Look up! Smile! Stand up! Come on! Bases, you're too weak! Bigger smiles! Again, from the mount. Time for a break. 1, 2, 3, break! I'm bushed! Hey, stand up! You're embarrassing us! Gen, why are you sitting down? Hey! Quiet! You, come with me. OK. - Pathetic! - Call that cheerleading? It's so springy! You can use this space when we aren't using it. - Really? - Yeah. But I think you need an instructor. An experienced cheerleader called Sho Tokugawa has enrolled this year. Try and find him. Sho Tokugawa? We were awful. Yeah. No good at all. But we learned a lot today. Yeah. We'll train hard tomorrow. Darn! We sucked bigtime! Ichiro. You're frustrated? Hey, Ichiro... What? Of course I am! Aren't you? They laughed at us! We got intimidated and failed! So uncool! Never seen that before. Good try, Ton! Thanks! Is he really somewhere here? That's what I heard. Do you know Sho Tokugawa? No, we don't. I see. Thanks. Maybe you heard wrong. Forget this. Yeah. - Let's go to Himawari. - OK. I struggled to do a forward roll. Never mind! Haru? What's up? That's him. It must be! Sho Tokugawa! Found you! Please! Join our cheerleading club! No. That's too fast! Hear us out! I saw your performance. You call that stunting? Even today, none of you could tumble properly. Cheerleading is tough. Quit before you get injured. Bye. Hey, wait! Why won't you join us? How dare you bring us down like that! What's with him and that attitude? Well, he does have an attitude. But he was right. We need someone experienced. I think you're right. As Sun Tzu said, "Know your enemy and yourself, and you'll win 100 battles." Why do you always say difficult stuff? What does it mean? He thinks he can't cheerlead with us, because we can't stunt or tumble. The problem is with us, not him. So we know what we have to do. We'll try to perfect our tossing by the next gym class. As for tumbling, we'll do a round off into a backflip. Tossing? A b-b-b... Backflip? We'll teach you how! We'll beat it into you! OK, we're all yours! Watch this! Like that. You float in the air for a second. That's it! What the heck is that? Yeah, like that! You're doing really well! Great! Haru. Kazu. Get on. Careful! Your body's so stiff! You can do it! Come on, Mizoguchi! I can't bend any more! You ready? Yeah. Right! You did it! Wow! Ms. Takagi! Hello! Hello. Training hard, I see. Yes, so we can show Sho Tokugawa next week. I see. He's amazing! On a different level to us. He's a fantastic base. How do you know him? My niece was his classmate. It might be difficult, but do your best, OK? OK! I'll get him to join for sure! Kick off with your feet a bit more. You're doing great! You've made a lot of progress! Well done! Why can't you do it? It's just a backflip! Sorry. Ton, watch this. A backsault! You just need momentum! Come on. Hey, stand up! Darn! I'll show you! Mizoguchi, concentrate! - Go for it! - OK! You can do it! Go on! Yeah! You did it! Yeah! - You did it! - Yeah! "Kazu: Well done! Fantastic!" "Gen: Nice one!" "Ichiro: Amazing!" "Well done!" Me! Watch this! Wow! Gen's amazing! You see that? We're gonna do it! Go on, Ichiro! Watch this, Tokugawa! - Concentrate! - Go on! Go on! You can do it! Go on, Mizoguchi! Ton, go for it! - Go on! - It's OK! You can do it! Are you OK? Nice try! Nice try! Mount! Ready? Wait! OK? - Elevator! - Just a sec! - OK? - Yeah. Ready? Steady! Yeah! OK? We'll toss you! - OK? - Toss! Catch him! We made it. It's still early days, but we can stunt and tumble now. So... please join us! He couldn't backflip. And you just threw him with brute force. A bunch of amateurs. It's a miracle nobody got hurt! So I'll teach you... the right way to do it. So you'll join us? Yeah. Then just say so! I was so worried! But... I'm not gonna stunt. - Really? - Why not? I'll only join on that condition. Kazu, is that OK? But you'll do everything else, right? Right. OK! Welcome, Sho! Thanks. Call, motion. And that's the elevator. OK so far? Yeah. The next step is much harder. The extension. The bases extend their arms fully to lift the top. It's an essential part of cheerleading, but it's dangerous. Now the basket toss. That's called a toe touch. Making aerial poses is very difficult. Fly, Kazumi! Amazing! The top becomes a star. I don't get it. She flew really high! Amazing! Cheerleaders inspire courage in those watching them. Never scare the audience. Always trust your teammates. If you're scared or nervous, the stunt group collapses. And... And? Make sure nobody ever gets injured. First, read these. "Problems"? Yeah, I wrote them. I have so many problems! A whole list of 'em! Why're you smiling? Of course, I have the most! "Many tenaciously follow the path they have chosen," "but very few pursue the goal." - Nietzsche. - Always with the difficult words! Haru! "Don't hunch your back"! It's underlined in red! Don't hunch! Thank you, Sho! Thanks! - We should tell Sho his problems. - Yeah! You have zero charm! Don't say that! I have charm! Your clothes don't match! You know nothing about style! Let's train hard tomorrow! - Yeah. - Let's make an early start. Train us hard! Let's go to Himawari. Sounds good to me! - Ever been there, Sho? - No. No? You've been missing out! Hi, everyone. We are the student union. What's that? A campus festival performance permit. You'll make your debut on the festival stage! You're like seven samurai bringing light and joy to a dark world! We're starting a movement. What's a "movement"? Don't ask me! Wait for me! Campus festivals are really exciting, right? There'll be so many girls! - No doubt! - I can't wait! And we'll be making our debut! The first time's always the best! We need to choose a team name. Yeah, that's really important! - "Glasses"! - No way! Only you wear them! - I know. - What? How about "Dreams"? "Dreams"? No way! Anyone else? I wanna destroy a lot of things. Destroy? The idea that cheerleading's for girls. That preconception that 7 members aren't enough. The wall of quotes that Mizoguchi hides behind. I'm not hiding anything. We're all hiding our feelings. Our lack of confidence. I wanna destroy all that. In other words, that's it! In other words? Destroy. Our team name is... "Breakers"! It's corny, but I like it! Yeah! We are... Come on! We are... Come on! Sho. We are... Bigger smiles, everyone! Yeah, smile! Come on! Let's go! The Dreams are here! Nice one, Top! You can do it! Who's she? No idea. Sho! Sho's here. Let's do this! Elevator! Ready? Don't bend your knees. Tense your buttocks. Right. Here goes. Extension! Ready? Yeah! Stay steady! Release! Nice one! Hello. Sho? I'll get the car. Sorry for interrupting. Why? How come? My aunt invited me. She said you were practicing. Just teaching the basics. That's all I'm doing. Cheerleading's so much fun! I feel great just watching. I'm glad you're doing it again. Sorry, I have to get back. Sho. Cheer smile! Chilled noodles, and a tofu hamburger. I'm not repeating all that! Who's the chick in the wheelchair? Your sweetheart? She's Ms. Takagi's niece. She told me. Who did? Ms. Takagi. And she said to look after you, Sho. We need Sho to look after us! Please be our guide! So what's your relationship? Please let us get better, and get Sho to stunt with us! With Sho as a base, we'd be rock solid. Your ex-girlfriend? Present girlfriend? Look, maybe he doesn't wanna say. What!? Come on, tell us, Sho! Your girlfriend, right? Don't be shy! There's no need to be embarrassed! Sho. Sho! I wanna try doing a basket toss at the festival. Think we can? Get the extension right first. Let's give it a try! Right? - Let's try it! - Yeah! We'll have to practice. OK! Let's practice tossing. No! We start with the elevator. Come on. What!? Again with the elevator! Ton, Mizoguchi. Stop looking down. Watch the top. Haru, straighten up. Concentrate. Ready? One more. Try again. Ready? Put him down. I'm OK. No! Put him down! Ready? One, two, three. Nice try. Ton, take a break. Ichiro, take his place. I don't need a break. I said no! You're tired and unsteady. Have a rest. Haru, keep your back straight. I told you before. OK. Gen, you be Top. Alright. Hi. Sorry. Forget it. I was unstable too. Hey, it's Ton! Still doing it? But you haven't lost much weight! You ain't built for sports! Yeah, you're way too fat, Ton! Cheerleading requires people of my size too. This is no fun. - Boring! - Let's go. Why's he so serious? Yeah, he sucks! The festival. Come and watch us. Haru, let's go. You what!? I don't get what you're saying. What's up? I want you to change your team name. But why? I was going to use you as the mascots of the festival. But the name "Breakers"... gives a negative impression. Breaking, smashing. How about a more constructive name? For example, how about "Builders"? It fits much more with the spirit of the times. No way. Changing your name will benefit the university. We ain't doin' it for the university. But you will. The festival performance. Letting you use this room. Who did that for you? What's her problem? Yeah! "Constructive"? "Spirit of the times"? - Speak Japanese! - Yeah! That is Japanese. "Change your team name." "For example, how about Builders?" Darn! Don't splash! See you tomorrow. Thank you. So tasty! Where's Mizoguchi? He left already. He said he was going back home to talk to his dad. - Gimme another. - OK. No style at all! Raise your leg! Swing it more! That's it! Hi. Still training? Yeah. The bout today. She lost. She wants to win next time. Nobody's come home to eat, so it's all just sitting there. Come on. Too slow! Step in quicker! "Giving support to others lifts your own spirits too." We've been trying toe touches recently. We still haven't cracked it. It's their death anniversary. Remember? Your daughter's name. Kazumi. My name is... Kazuma. - Do it, Haru! - OK! Raring to go, eh, Haru? Right! Bases, watch your height. OK. Concentrate. - Mount! - OK! Kazu. Yeah. Toss! Ready? Catch him! Haru! Are you hurt? I'm fine. Bases! Concentrate! Even a moment's lapse is dangerous! Put some ice on, just in case. I'll go get some. Thanks. Sorry. I wanna pull it off. A toe touch. I wanna fly high at the festival and see them all from above. The smiles we put on people's faces. I'm gonna go see my gran. Oh. I'll go with you. No. Why not? Let's go. I said no! Sorry. What's up, Kazu? Do lots of stretches, OK? "Meishiin Festival" Mizo's at a job interview. Ichiro'll be here soon. Heard from Kazu? No. Again? He hasn't come to practice all week. We're running out of time. I've produced a male cheerleading team. The Builders. By using them as mascots, I've created more buzz about the festival than anyone else ever has. I'd like to contribute my promotional skills to this company. Mr. Mizoguchi, are you listening? It's only a mock interview, so please relax. The Breakers... aren't here to improve your resume. From now on, don't use us for your own gain! We are... Breakers! Mr. Mizoguchi? Mizoguchi. Haru. How's your job hunting? Difficult. I began applying too late. I was gonna join my family business, but I've changed my mind. How come? "The will to keep searching creates discoveries." Darwin. Before I go back home, there's still time to see other places. My dad got mad, though. I see. You aren't together! Again. Okay. Mizoguchi! Keep in step. How many times have I told you? Sorry. It's OK. Never mind. Oh. Ichiro, concentrate. Sorry! My bad. Stop laughing! Don't you think... you're being too harsh? Without Kazu, we can't practice much. I don't want any injuries! Please concentrate. Don't do it half-assed. So why don't you help us stunt? Take Kazu's place. I can't. Why? I said when I joined. I'm not gonna stunt. Why not? You're the most half-assed! I'm half-assed? "I'll do this, but not that." Think you're special? Don't wanna stunt with us? How can you enjoy it? Calm down. Calm down. You know, I put my all into this! "Always trust your teammates." That's what you said. If there's some reason you won't stunt, just tell us. No, forget it. This guy doesn't trust us. Ichiro, wait. We've just started practicing. So? Ichiro, don't go yet! I have no right. If I'm a base, I might injure someone again. That girl in the wheelchair. Her name's Sakura. My former teammate. I was a base, and she was the top. I let her fall. It's my fault she can't walk. That's why I can't stunt, or enjoy cheerleading. I don't have the right to. You what? So why did you join the Breakers? Huh? Can't you answer? Why did you all join? Bye. See you tomorrow. Hi. You want to, don't you? Stunt. I told you, I can't. Not taking part... won't help Sakura's injuries. I know that. So don't use her as an excuse. When Sakura came here, she looked really happy you were cheerleading again. Mizo? If I'd never done cheerleading, I'd've graduated university without knowing... you can use windows like this. The world... is full of things unknown to me. I started cheerleading... to find out those things! There are still... so many things I can't do. But I can do a few more now. That makes me happy! I see. Hey! Good evening. I've heard you landed a job. Yes. Wait! Good luck in your job hunting! I don't need your support! "Sorry. I'm quitting cheerleading." Kazu. "Kamegai Osteopathic Clinic" Huh!? You stalking me? I knew your shoulder hurt. Why didn't you say? Forget it. What? I don't wanna cause a fuss. You've always been that way. It doesn't feel like we're on the same team! It ain't no fun! You never change. Not relying on others. I ain't goin' out like that! After those girls laughed at us, you showed how you felt. The first time ever! I was so happy! I thought you'd rely on me for once! I thought we could. Through cheerleading. Rely on each other. Share feelings. Say when we feel bad! Support each other. I've always wanted us to do that! To be part of the same team! We are. What do you think I am? A solitary genius! Don't give me that! What!? Like I'm gonna be a pro at something? Idealizing me. You don't get me at all! Lean on me! What for? Let me support you! I'll... be able to walk soon. And cheerlead. If you slack off, I'll soon be better than you! Sakura. I can't stay away from cheerleading. I love it! Kazu. Why're you quitting? Haru. My gran's senile. These past two years, she's got so feeble. Always forgetting things. But in April, she suddenly remembered my mom. Here. Yummy! Kazumi. Gran! Kazumi. Just then, I had an idea. If I did cheerleading like Mom, maybe she'd remember me, too. So I tried. But it didn't work. She's forgotten who I am. She never moves, never smiles. Like an ornament. There's nobody left who cares about me. She was all the family I had. I said all that to get people to join, but really, it was just for myself. "A talent for supporting"! I knew you wanted to quit judo, so I used that. Kazu. I'm awful, aren't I? Go home, Haru. Forget about me. Let's carry on! What for? I wanna do it with you. I wanna... cheerlead with you. I'm doing it for myself too. We all are. We wanna transform ourselves and gain confidence. Each for ourselves. And that's OK. What we like doing, what we wanted to do. Accepting that. Each of us feels different. But we encourage each other, support each other, doing things we can't do alone. And so... you aren't alone. I mean, I'm right here! Always have been. Ever since we were kids. So don't say you're alone! Stop crying! Good to see you. You too. Kazu! I've been so worried! Where were you? I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Sho. Can I stunt with you? 'Course you can! At the festival, we're gonna do a basket toss! He's full of spirit! Can't wait to stunt with you! Let's practice. Practice! Let's do this! Sis. Good morning. Listen. What? We're performing at the festival, so... I still don't understand why you quit judo. Your shoulder's healed, and you can get stronger! Why run away? It healed a while ago. Judo was too tough for me. Look, I find it tough too sometimes, you know? But I don't run away! I didn't run away. I chose my own path. I'm glad I believed in what I wanted to do. Now I can say I'm glad I chose cheerleading. Come and see our show. I want you to see it. I wanna support you, Sis. See you later. Alright. Let's go see 'em enjoy their youth! OK? The grilled chicken's on you. Sure, whatever you want! "Closed from 1 PM to 3 PM due to Breakers performance" "Meishiin Festival" The performance is about to begin, so please take your seats! What you doin'? "Hard work always pays off!" I've always... wanted to do this. Don't look! You too, Haru! - Kazu, do mine! - Straight off your feet!? Ichiro. Will this do the job? Yeah. Don't worry, just jump! Ton! Pull off that backflip, yeah? OK! I've never been so nervous in my life! But I want everyone to see. I can't wait to be on stage! I get it! Just do it like we practiced. The same way. We can do it! It's OK! We're OK! Deep breaths. Mizoguchi. Those glasses. My dad sent them to celebrate me getting a job. They suit you. "From yesterday's struggle comes today's hope." Mizoguchi, who are you quoting? Right now, that's how I feel. Mizoguchi! You're the best! Ladies and gentlemen, the Breakers will soon appear! Yes! Our first performance. Haru. He looks nervous! "Second to none!!" Male cheerleading team, the Breakers! Haruki! 3 months after forming, this festival is our first ever performance! Sis. Thank you all... for being here!
