So go ahead and publicize your love story. - Rita.. Love, fragrance, illness and happiness can never be hidden. I have only told them about my love, so what's wrong with it? They would have known someday. So I told them today. Indeed! - Hey, smile now! You can leave now. - What's the hurry? Wait a bit. If my dad comes to know, we will never be able to meet again! Is that so? Then I must meet him right away! Are you crazy! He will shoot you! Let him shoot... let him finish me off.. But I won't be parted from you. Who will convince Daddy? - You! I...? - Tell him that we love each other... and wish to get married. - I don't have the courage. You're scared and you don't let me meet him. I'm late. Leave now! Rita! I'll meet you tomorrow. Good night. - Good night. Hands up! Where is he? I will shoot him today! Who, Dad? - The one whom you meet. The vagabond! Scoundrel! - But Meena is a nice girl, my best friend. And you have always liked her! I even took your permission before leaving. Oh! Hands down. Thank you. Stop! You are trying to fool me. You didn't meet Meena, but that vagabond who sings at the hotel. You mean, Shekhar? - Yes, that rascal! But singing is not a bad profession. I know that as long as you are here, you'll keep meeting him. He is a cartoon who has donkey's whiskers! But, Dad, donkeys don't have whiskers. - You shut up. Go to your room. We're leaving for Calcutta early tomorrow. Calcutta! But it's very humid in Calcutta. Rex's health will deteriorate! Not his, but yours! Remember that I am Rai Bahadur Digambar Prasad Rai. I will get you married the moment we land in Calcutta. But daddy.. - Shut up! Prepare for the journey! Right turn. Quick march! Keshto! - Sir, your milk. It's not me, but for the dog, Rex. - Oh sorry. Rex darling, drink. Oh! You! - Yes. I heard what your father said. He plans to get you married in Calcutta. I'll see who dares to come in my way! I will elope with you... If daddy hears you, he will shoot you! He can't scare me with his air-gun! I will talk to him right now and decide once and for all. Please escape from the window! Do you take me to be a coward? I'll go right now! Who's in there? Open the door! I won't spare the devil! Shekhar. Please escape from the window. - You leave me with no choice. But remember I will follow you to Calcutta. Wherever you go, I go. - Open the door. I will be lonely without you. Open the door! Open the door! Yes. Where's that scoundrel! He dares to enter my house! But Daddy, there's no one here! - I heard his voice. You heard voices on the radio. This is the radio speaking. Radio? Ghost! It's me. - You're late again. Is Mother asleep? - Yes. Don't make noise. I'm hungry. Give me some food. Mother. Mother, I was held up. Aren't you ashamed? You are away most of the day and... you're having late nights, too. How long will this go on? It will stop soon. I am leaving for Calcutta tomorrow. Calcutta? - No chance of progress in this town. I will find a better job in a big hotel or a club. I will earn much more. - We are leading a comfortable life... But in Calcutta... - Change your decision. I am no longer a kid to get lost. Please give me permission. - No. Calcutta is a dangerous city. It's huge. I am scared. - What is there to be scared about? I won't be alone there. Please give me permission. Okay. But I will come with you. - Sure, you can come. But I will first find a house and a job and then take you along. Are you happy? I'm famished. Keshto! One more pillow. And get me my night dress. Tonight I'll sleep in peace. Rita, come in and relax. What are you doing there? Coming, Dad. Move and make way for the sage. Let me come in. Hail the Goddess. What are you doing? This is the first class compartment. Every class is the same for a sage. I'm a devotee. The world is also ours. Hail the Goddess. Come sit beside me. Go, dear. Fulfill the sage's wish. Come, lady. Your daughter is very fortunate... She will get married to... a fair and handsome man who will be a lover of music. Lover of music? Music is not a bad choice. Even Lord Krishna as the shepherd played the flute. Sir, even Mr. Choudhary appreciates English music. Oh, yes, oh, yes. You are right. Now find a quick solution for her marriage. Right away! Show me your palm. No. I don't like to show my palm. Not to everyone, but I am a lover... What? I mean... I'm a lover of the world! Right, son? Right. The world is an illusion. Only love is true. Hail the Goddess. Now I will concentrate on my hymns. Lady, you too can concentrate on your love. You can close your eyes and lose yourself in my hymns. "Look, a carefree monk..." "comes to Your doorstep." "Look, a carefree monk..." "comes to Your doorstep." "Look, a carefree monk..." "I'm here to meet You." "I thirst to see You." "I'm here to meet You." "I thirst to see You." "Open your eyes, silly, say something." "Why do you hide your face?" "Look, a carefree monk..." "I'm here to meet You." "Look, a carefree monk..." "I don't belong to a country, I don't belong to a village." "There's just one name on my lips, always." "I don't belong to a country, I don't belong to a village." "There's just one name on my lips, always." "With my music and the desire to meet..." "I sing the song in my heart." "Look, a carefree monk..." "I'm here to meet You. Look, a carefree monk..." "Why I assumed this guise is a secret." "You are my beloved, I'm Yours, let the world not believe it." "Why I assumed this guise is a secret." "You are my beloved, I'm Yours, let the world not believe it." "In your love, I have seen the entire world..." "yet nothing amuses me." "Look, a carefree monk..." "comes to Your doorstep." "Look, a carefree monk..." "comes to Your doorstep." "Look, a carefree monk..." Hail the Goddess. Scoundrel! You cheat us in the garb of a sage! Get lost or I'll shoot you! How can I? The train's moving! I'll break my legs and you'll go to prison! I'll go to prison! Pull the chain. - That's okay. Rita was always thinking of you. What are you saying? - See, how she blushes. I too was wondering when you would come. When I would meet you. I'd even booked seats for Darjeeling, but postponed because... of some work or the other. You were involved in your business and she with her friends. Busy enjoying races, films... day in and day out. And she used to think of you in her free time. I wish I was there. - What would have happened? I would have spent some time with you. You are right, Choudhary. You have lost the opportunity. Keshto, look after Rex. - Yes, sir. It's said one must gain the dog's love before wooing the master. Wonderfully said, Choudhary, wonderfully said. I have decided to give Rex as a wedding present. - What? Yes, I will give him to you. Hello. Come down. No! No! - Hey, come down. Daddy's at home. Then throw me a rope. - Where do I get it from? From anywhere, or I'll jump down. Go away. I'll jump and kill myself. And you'll have to mourn forever. One minute. Wait! I'll find one. Here I come. Shekhar, you shouldn't have come here. You threw the rope and called me here. So, here I am! What could I do? You threatened to kill yourself. Either way I would have had problems. It's the same here. Whether I meet you or not, I'm not at peace. Is this the way to meet? Why are you fuming? I tried many other ways. I rang up, but your Daddy picked up the phone. "This is Rai Bahadur speaking." I tried writing to you, but the watchman refused to deliver it. This was the only solution and you didn't like it! Tell me where and how do I meet you? There's a solution to your problems. What? - Find a nice job. Where and when are we meeting...? Daughter! - Coming, Dad! Tell me. This is not fair. Where are we meeting? You will tell me? - Yes. Bye. - Bye. Daughter.. Choudhary rang up and he wants to talk to you. You talk to him. - What's this rope for? What? Which rope? You mean this rope! Why is the bed shaking? - There's an earthquake! What earthquake? You rascal! Catch him! Don't let him escape. Catch him! Catch him! Anything else? What do you mean what else? This scoundrel is following my daughter from Darjeeling. I want to get her married elsewhere... But inspector, Rita wants to marry me. What did you say? Marry you? I will shoot both of you! He owns an air-gun and threatens everyone with it! Be quiet. What's wrong with me? Am I not a qualified gentleman? You are a loafer and a scoundrel! What is worse, you're a singer! Inspector, he should be severely punished! He will be punished, Rai sahib. Greetings, Mr. Dutta. - Greetings. Good. You have arrived. Now you can handle this case. I've heard everything. Constable! Take him to my room. - Inspector, this is injustice! Rai Bahadur's son-in-law cannot be at fault... Father-in-law, explain to them. - Shut up! Come on. Don't worry. You can leave peacefully. Thank you, Mr. Dutta. Goodbye. - Everything will be all right. Have the fingerprint reports arrived? - Not yet! Not yet... Inspector, please listen to me! I'm innocent. Listen to me! I'll hear everything. First you sit down. Thank you. Shut the door.. - Yes, sir. What's your name? - Shekhar. Why don't you leave this job? Leave the job? - Yes. But what else can I do? I can't get a decent job and I don't have the money for business. I will give you a well-paying and decent job. A decent paying job? I'm ready to give my life for it. Tell me about it. It's risky business... It's dangerous as well as a responsible job. No problem. Think it over. - I don't change my decisions easily. Tell me what to do. - Follow me then. Come with me. Look over there. Take your medicines, Mike. Doctor! Don't get excited. You may order your favourite drink. You've tried every trick, Inspector. But I always refuse. If you turn approver and tell us about... Mike cannot be bought! Now get out! Did you notice the resemblance? - I'm surprised. Nothing surprising. There are people who resemble each other. But inspector, who is he? Mike. Yes.. He's the most dangerous criminal of China Town. If not for the accident, we would have never arrested him. Unfortunately, inspite of our efforts... he has not revealed the names of his accomplices... the nature of the nefarious activities, their whereabouts... Oh, oh, but inspector.. What has this got to do with me? You will tell us what he has not revealed so far. Me...? But how? - You will have to become Mike. You'll have to go to China Town and join his gang. No inspector. They'll see through the game and kill me! We will train you in such a way... that they will think you are one of them. But you will help us. This is hotel Blue Dragon in China Town. This is the main hall. This is Joseph Wong, who owns the hotel. And the dancer is Susie. Susie? - Yes. And this is Mike, who's in our custody. Watch him walk. These are his associates. On his right is Chengwa. Usman on the other. Chengwa and Usman? - Yes. Chengwa and Usman. See her working her charm on him. I think they are in love. Does that mean I'll have to love her, too? No! Just pretend. That's fine. Inspector, one thing I couldn't figure out... when you have the evidence, why don't you arrest them? We want to know their modus operandi. Or from where and how they get their goods. And the name of their Boss. I understand. I want to see how Mike behaves with women. We will make some arrangements. - Thank you. Mike? Mike? Nurse...? What is it? I'm meeting you with great difficulty. Why? - Wong has sent me to you. Wong - Yes. I have to get you out some way or the other. Code number? - Code.. Susie has sent me. She loves you a lot. But Mike has never loved anyone, nor will he... Please Mike! So Wong and Susie have sent you. Mike can never be trapped by the police. Get out! See that? Mike can never be trapped by the police. Get out! Hello? Hello! Who is it? Please speak here. Hello. My respects. - May you be happy. May I know who's speaking? - This is Sheela here. - Sheela? Is Rita there? - Rita is right here. I'll give the phone. How's your father's health? He expired long ago. - What! You were inquiring about Neela's father? No. I was talking about your father. He was not well. He's fine now. He's gone to the office. Office! When did he return from Delhi? Delhi? I mean, his office at Delhi. Here, dear. Hello Sheela. Is your Daddy standing beside you? - No. He's sitting. Rita, Shekhar speaking. Damn! Rita, this is Shekhar here. I have changed my voice just to talk to you. I was just saved. I have something important to say. Come immediately. Let me ask Daddy. Sheela is requesting me to go shopping with her. Sure, you can go. Sheela, daddy has given me the permission. Good. I like your father very much. I feel like kissing... But where shall we go? "Don't ask me where we are going." "Don't ask me where we are going." "We'll go where this heart takes us." "Beautiful sights and the Spring..." "follow the obsessed ones everywhere." "Don't ask us where we are going." "The world is a city of desires," "of varied of tales." "The world is a city of desires," "of varied of tales." "We journey narrating legends..." "like a musical wave." "Don't ask us where we are going." "As our blossoming dreams paint us in new hues," "even the earth embraces the sky." "As our blossoming dreams paint us in new hues," "even the earth embraces the sky." "The rose garden is in bloom," "even the clouds are as merry as the sky." "Don't ask us where we are going." "Don't ask us where we are going." "As the boat slowly lugs ahead" "it feels like the water's on fire." "As the boat slowly lugs ahead" "it feels like the water's on fire." "As the boat slowly lugs ahead" "it feels like the water's on fire." "As we meet gazes in ardour" "the waves ask us where we are headed." "Don't ask us where we are headed." "Don't ask us where we are going." "We'll go where the heart takes us." "Beautiful sights and the Spring..." "follow the obsessed ones everywhere." "Don't ask us where we are going." Bholu! When did you come? - Just today, sir. - Where's mother? Son, you've come! - Mother... What have you done to yourself? I have shaved and had a haircut. How do I look? - No. But you didn't inform me about your arrival. Here is the letter. It was lying here. Looks like you don't return home everyday. My work demands it. - What kind of a job is it? Just think that I've become a police officer. - Police officer? Don't tell anyone about it. - But you spoke of a club or a hotel... I'd have done that. I was lucky the police officer met me. They have chosen me because I resemble a criminal. What did you say? He resembles you? We are identical. Even you could be fooled... Except for the hair and the moustache which I have shaved off. What's his name? - Mike. He's a dangerous gangster. The police have arrested him with great difficulty... What's the matter, mother? - Nothing. What are you thinking of? - Nothing. Let's eat. Yes, mother. It's been long since I've tasted your food. Mother! What's wrong? You look worried. No, I was just thinking I shouldn't have come to Calcutta. Why? What happened? You spoke about the identical criminal... So, you're still thinking about him? - I'm worried. I pray he might not be... - What? I hope Mike isn't your brother. Mother.. What are you saying! - Yes. Twenty years ago... Your father used to play the violin in a hotel in this very city. The gangsters of China Town smuggled drugs through him. My father? - But he was not aware of it. The gangsters smuggled it in his violin. But when he came to know, he informed the police. And later that night... Who is it? - We are Ramlal's friends. Open the door. - He's not in at the moment. Open the door or we'll break it open. Where's Ramlal? - Why are you closing the door? Where's Ramlal? - He's not returned from his work. You're lying! - He must be hiding somewhere. Search the room. I told you there's no one here. - You shut up! There's no one here. Where are you going? - Quiet! He must have escaped. - Where could he go? I'm Wong. I've got a good hold on the entire city. Look how well they're sleeping. Good. What's wrong if we take one along with us? No! - Don't worry! Your kid will be his father's insurance. No! Don't take away my child. Send Ramlal to us. We'll return the kid. I beg of you! Don't take my child. - Move! The scoundrels took him away. We haven't found him till today. After so many years I feel that Mike may be my son. Maybe. What about father? They killed him I was widowed. Why didn't you tell me all this earlier? I was scared that you'd go away in search of your brother. I was scared of losing you, too. Shekhar, take me to him just once. Sure mother, I will take you. Are you asleep? Who are you? Who are you? Why have you come? I've come to meet you, son. Son? - Yes. I am your unfortunate mother, Shankar. My name's not Shankar, but Mike. You may be known as Mike, but you are Shankar to me. You are Shekhar's brother. - I don't have a brother or mother. I am all alone in this world. Absolutely alone. I've been praying for the past twenty years that I'd find you someday. I never expected to meet you in this place. But whatever you are, you are my son. - Don't touch me! Go away! Tell the inspector that the police cannot trick me. Don't say such things, son. - Go away from here. Go find your son elsewhere!? Shankar - Get out. Please come, Madam. - Inspector, I know this is your trick. Son! I am very sure that he is my son. He is my lost son, Shankar. But how do I convince him that he is my son? If he is your son, it will be proved at the right time. Anything for me, Inspector? You are on duty. - Thank you, sir. I only hope that I can save my brother in time. I will surely try to. Thank you, sir. Come Mother. Mike turned approver. Today's flash! Mike will stand witness against criminals. Today's fresh news! Mike will turn approver. How is Mike? - He is sleeping, doctor. He is in this room. This is the opportunity. Come! Sorry, Mike, sorry. You dared to kill me! Mike. Because you were going to become the witness! Mike, a witness. Come on, let's escape. Let's go from here. Come on. You are so stupid. You still don't know me. I was sure that you'd read the news. And try to kill me, and make it easy for me to escape. - What? Yes, Wong. Everything took place, just as I had planned. You are very intelligent. The boss will happy to see you. Yeah, yeah. Come on, Mike. Tell Susie, Mike has returned. - Okay, sir. Hi, Mike. - Hello Mike. - Hello. Can you forget Ching Lee? - Mike can never forget Ching Lee. Come on, come on, Mike. Nice. Very nice. Doesn't look like I was absent for twenty days. Susie has done it. She used to clean your room everyday. She was sure you'd come back. Oh, Mike. You've come back! I was sure you would! You would surely come. And I have returned. - Susie, you talk to him. I'll announce Mike's arrival. Mike, you have no idea how I spent my days without you. Every moment I was thinking of you. How are you? Where are you? - Susie. But you must not have thought of me. Susie.. I thought about you, too. You missed me? Oh, how wonderful. Mike, I love you. Mike, you don't know. When the boss gave orders to murder you... I was very scared. I cried and prayed a lot. And the Lord heard your prayers. Yes. Mike you wouldn't believe, the day you left for work... I was very worried about you. So, you were worried? - Yes. I was talking to you, I didn't even realise... What will you have? What will you drink? Nothing. Wait. The police has arrived. Hide quickly! The police? Who informed them? There's no time to talk. Hide quickly. Hide inside. - But where? You've forgotten? Come in, sir. You've checked that room. Now you can search here. What happened to Mr. Wong? What's the search for? What can I say, Susie, the inspector says that Mike has escaped. Mike has escaped? - Yes. And he's hiding here! Oh no! Mike's not here. - We know everything, Mr. Wong. What can I do, Sir. Nice. Thank you, sir. You are suspecting me unnecessarily. I am an honest businessman. My hotel has been a decent place for so many years. You are very smart. - Thank you. The police has gone away. Thank you. How did you forget the place? I didn't. My mind's not working after the torture. I didn't sleep well there. Did the police torture you a lot? - Yes! A lot. I need rest now. Okay. You sleep. I will leave now. Good night. Hi Mike, come in. We are talking about you. Oh I see. What were you saying? - Our agents are demanding the goods. Agents? - Take a look at the list. Oh, never mind. A ship's arriving from Singapore on Sunday. Go get the goods. Very good. Very good. I have just returned from the hospital. I need rest. Mike, and rest! - I am not in good health these days. You will not keep well. You've not taken your medicines for a long time. Medicines? Should I get opium? No. I've lost the habit after being in the hospital for so many days. Never mind. You'll change your habits in a few days time. Come on, let's go to the smoking room. Let's go. - Yes, come on. Come Mike, come. Come, come. Come on, come on. Hey, Nitya! - Yeah. Look, Mike has come! - Mike. Hello Mike. You've come after a long time. Come on! Have a double dose. Yes! You're right. Come and sit down. You've not smoked for long. Smoke as much as you can. I'm not keeping too well. You go ahead and smoke. Enjoy yourself. "You are a firefly, I'm fire." "You are a firefly, I'm fire." "Everyone is staggering." "Look at them ecstatic." "Everyone calls me..." "sweetheart." "You are a firefly, I'm fire." "You are a firefly, I'm fire." "How do I tread unseen?" "The world stops me, I can't even dance freely." "The world stops me, I can't even dance freely." "Every madman is pining..." "for more." "Every eye..." "stops at me." "You are a firefly, I'm fire." "You are a firefly, I'm fire." "Everyone I see, has his heart out for me." "His eyes betray desire, his lips, love." "His eyes betray desire, his lips, love." "Every heart..." "is brimming with love." "Oh, how can I dance away..."

"I'm a firefly, you are fire." "You are a firefly, I'm fire." "You are a firefly, I'm fire." What are you doing? You've just escaped and you're dancing in public! I've had opium after a long time. It had its toll on me. What if the police had seen you! They can't catch me now. Come on. Come on. What are you doing here at this hour? And what are you up to at this hour? Me? I was preparing the list of goods. List? At this time of the night, all alone? You're trying to find the list in the dark? You think I'm a fool? What are you saying? - I was suspicious the day you... escaped so easily from the hospital. I am sure you are one with the police. Philip. - I have enough proof of your betrayal. Mr. Rohan, leave from here. Mr. Rohan. Mr. Rohan, fast. Mr. Rohan fast. The alarm bell! Looks like trouble. Come on. Come on. Switch on the lights! What's the matter, Mike? - Thief! Traitor! Good you've come along. He had come to steal. Him, a thief? - Just check if anything is missing. Where's the list of the agents? - List? Hope he doesn't have it. Look! He had it! He would have handed it over to the police if I wasn't here on time. I never knew Philip was a traitor! I realise now who was informing the police about us. Scoundrel! Betrayer! He betrayed us. Tie him up and throw away his body. - It's my responsibility. I shall leave no trace of him. - Yes, yes. Let him regain his consciousness. He was an old associate. We shall find out the truth from him. Traitors will always be treated badly. Yes! He's right. Just put him in the car. Congratulations on your first job. Thank you, sir. Excuse me sir. I have put Philip in the car. - Good. I am leaving now. Be careful. We have posted a beggar outside the hotel. You can pass on information. - Very good. Hello. - Hello Rita. You? I am yearning to meet you. Can you come now? So late in the night? No, not now. Okay, okay. But we'll meet at 8.10 tomorrow on the banks of the river. I'll meet you tomorrow. Okay, good night. Mike. It's good you're ready. There's something urgent come up. I am not going to work today. - What? Your friend John is away from Singapore. He won't handover the stuff to anyone else except you. The meeting time is 8.00 sharp. 8.00.. Where am I supposed to meet him? You ask as if you don't know a thing. The usual place, on the ship. Oh. Is anyone else coming along? - Take Usman with this cash. Thank you. Which ship is he boarding? S.S. Shanghai. Get ready, I'll send Usman here. - Oh, yes. Police. How did the police arrive? - Let's leave. No! Follow me. Help! Follow them! Both of you jump when I slow the car ahead. How about you? - Don't worry. I'll join you later. What are you doing, Rita? Oh, it's you. You carry on your deals in disguise. Relax, I'll explain everything later. What more can you say? Stop the car or I'll jump! I'll explain later. - I don't want to listen to anything. Please you've got to help me instead of yelling. Stop the car! I am not going with you. - Come along... or you'll be arrested along with me. - That'll be fine too! C'mon, silly girl! Come! - No... We are lucky to find a hotel. Come.. We'll take shelter here as long as the police is around. I will not stay with you for a single moment. Try to understand, our plans might flop otherwise! You'll be arrested with me and sent to jail. You'll earn a bad name. The only daughter of Rai Bahadur will be known as a smuggler. Your life will be ruined. You have put me in a jeopardy. It can be made easy for you if you do as I say. Do what...? - Come on! Look, there are burglars at the door! No one lets me sleep well. There are robbers here. Open the door. You open it. - Don't be scared. I'll come along. Anybody home? Open the door! Who is it? - A man and a woman. Ask him his details. - What are you doing at this hour? Greetings! - Greetings! We arrived from Calcutta. Our car broke down on the way. We would be grateful if you gave us shelter. Their car broke down. Nothing to be scared about. Open the door. They're tired. Open the door. Move aside, let them come in. Hello. - Come. We are careful of visitors who are strangers. Many couples elope. - Don't worry. We are already married. What? This is my wife. - This is my wife. - Good. We'll spend the night here. And if need be, give you an advance. No need. - I'll give you 100 in advance. Give me the money. Give the money. I will go make a call and return quickly. Please come along, Madam. Is there a telephone nearby? - There's one at the post office. Can you come along? - I'm going with him. Please be seated. What's your name? Rita. Rita, not Sita. Lovely name. What's your husband's name? My husband...? - Sit down, don't be scared. I was just asking your husband's name. I get it! Girls are normally shy to utter their husband's names. I feel shy to take my husband's name, too. How do I convince you...? - Oh! I understand. I am like your younger sister. Don't feel shy. How many years have you been married? How many children do you have? - Children...? Why do you feel shy? There's no vermillion on your forehead. Why is your forehead bare? Let me bring some vermillion for you. Vermillion is a must for married women. - How do I tell you... I understand. It is here. Listen to me. - Show me your forehead. You're a moon-faced beauty. By God! Please call Inspector Dutta. You haven't slept yet. What was the need of waiting for me? Don't talk with me. Even I don't want to see your face. What about the one in the heart? - I'll chuck it out. I'll replace it! - I'll chuck it out again. I'll replace it! - Aren't you ashamed of doing such work? You should drown yourself! - I would have. But I thought about you. So, you're doing this work for me? I have taken up the job for you and your father's happiness. I am going to earn a lot of respect through it. Yes, I know how much of respect. You'll be handcuffed and imprisoned! I will not be handcuffed, I handcuff others... I won't be imprisoned, I imprison others. I work for the state. For the state. Ruined my sleep again! Who is it? - Police. Oh Lord! The police! Open the door. I am innocent! Shut up! - He is like a saint, sir! Has a man come with a woman? - Yes. Where is he? - In the room, Sir. You wait here. - We aren't running away, don't worry. Oh, Inspector come in. - Hello. You're under arrest. What have I done? - You'll know at the police station. What have I done? - You'll regret this, officer. Don't you know I am Rai Bahadur's daughter? Whoever you are, you have been caught with a criminal. Come along. I am Rai Bahadur's son-in-law. She's my fiancee. Do you what she will think? Shut up! Come along with me. Come. Go, sir. You said that the inspector would free you. Official man, indeed! You be quiet! I don't like your kind of jokes. It's a question of my life. You'll have to tell her the truth or I'll quit the job. You've already told her whatever was there to be said. What? Whatever he told you was the truth. Did you hear? Thank you. I was scared the way you behaved earlier. How could I reveal to them, who you were. Please don't reveal to anyone that he works for us. No. I won't say a word. Thank you, Miss Rita. - I promise. I'll see you to the car. Speak up. - I won't talk to you. Why? What have I done? You don't consider me as yours? - What? What? You have taken up a good job and didn't let me know. If I had told you, how could we meet so often? What about the love that would follow? You must have enjoyed it. But how I suffered the fat lady. Why? What did she do? - What else? She was asking when I got married. Or, how many children we have. When she found no vermillion on my forehead, she applied some! Is that so? Then let me wipe it off. "This colour will never fade," "it's the memento of love." "This colour will never fade," "it's the memento of love." "It's about your story..." "and mine." "This colour will never fade," "it's the memento of love." "This colour will never fade,." "The weather rose in grace," "the season brought me peace." "The weather rose in grace," "the season brought me peace." "Spring came," "though not without pain." "Not without pain..." "but so exciting." "This colour will never fade,." "Those eyes are nothing..." "but intoxication." "Those eyes are nothing..." "but intoxication." "I've gone crazy..." "in love." "Either we are crazy..." "or the season." "This colour will never fade." "Don't ever forget..." "the promises of love." "Don't ever forget..." "the promises of love." "Don't ever change..." "your resolves in love." "Now that I'm in love with you..." "my resolves are firm." "This colour will not fade," "it's the memento of love." "It's about your story..." "and mine." "This colour will not fade," "it's the memento of love." "This colour will not fade." Hello, Suzie! Mike! You escaped, thank God! - There was no trouble, I hope. We were waiting for you. Did the police follow you? I don't give up easily. Here, take the stuff. Thank you. Thank you. Take the stuff and see that everything's fine. Mike and Usman will go .. ...to Roshanara's bungalow tomorrow evening. I am tired now. Good night. Okay. You can rest now. We are leaving. Good night, Mike. - Good night. Didn't you leave? Usman told me that the girl you went out with was very beautiful. What do you mean? - So you were with her all the time. I spent the night. Why? Who was she? What's your relation with her? Susie.. I never give an explanation where girls are concerned. I am feeling sleepy. You can leave now. All right, what's the price? Twenty rupees. - No. I'll pay only ten rupees. Ten rupees? - Yes. Where's Mike? - He's coming. Have you filled the stuff properly. - Yes, I've done it. You're coming like this? What if the police recognises you? I am not stupid. I have already kept the stuff in the car. Change your shoes. I'll bring the car along. Show me. You don't talk much. I'm scared of you these days. - What's the matter? If I make some mistake you'll kill me too. You know the rules here. A betrayer is always punished. What's the matter Mike? The shoe doesn't seem to fit you. Looks like your feet have grown. No your measurements must be wrong. Measurements wrong? You have been wearing my shoes for 2 years now. And I have been making them for the last ten years. How can it change now? - I was just joking. The shoes fit me well. Thank you, Mike. I was thinking, changes must have taken place in police custody. No. There have been no changes. Mike can never change. Look, the shoes fit me well. Okay, Ching Lee. Bye, bye. A penny for me, my dear man... A penny for me, my dear man... May God bless you. A penny for me, my dear man... A penny for me, my dear man... A penny for me, my dear man... Is Roshanara at home? - Your name and nature of work? Tell her Chin Chin Chu. Chin Chin Chu. She's been waiting for you. - Okay, okay. Thank you.. Greetings.

Any new couplets? - What have I come for? Okay. Cheena, take their shoes. Take them carefully. They are a poet's shoes. Okay, I'll go read your couplets. What's the hurry? First, let's rejoice. What do you say, Roshanara? Sure. Well said. It was just a droplet... that formed an ocean of intoxication. Please have it. I drink only the holy Ganga water. Since you are forcing me. But please don't let the others know. Do you think I would do that? Please begin. - Okay, surely. You have shown us the wonder of your clapping. Now, let's have some dance. "Let's see your charms, your traits, your beauty... let there be a storm rising in your heart... and mine... my heart and your heart!" - Indeed! You are amazing. "Don't ask me what I have done." "Don't ask me how I was left in tears." "Some saw his charm." "As for me, I just fell for simplicity." "God help." "My beloved is a killer." "My beloved is a killer." "My beloved is a killer." "Yet not a dagger or sword he wields." "Yet not a dagger or sword he wields." "Juliet could vouch for her attitude." "Juliet could vouch for her attitude." "Her beauty, devastating."

You are amazing. - Great. Mr. Dukhiram.. You have seen me dance, now come have a look at my stuff. Come on. - Come. - Come on. Roshanara Begum... you can also join us. Come. You walk so steadily! Amazing! Let me show you the stuff. You must not have bought one for years. Look. Watch it carefully. The stuff is pure. - Then shell out the money. The police have come! - Let them come. The police are here! This is because of your carelessness. This is not the time for arguments. Let's escape. - But... Let's go. Where are they going? Boss, the police! Arrest them! Not me. - Where have the scoundrels gone? There's nobody here, by God. - Frisk them. Carefully. - Shut up! Take them away. - C'mon. - Brother! Hi, Ching Lee! Where are my shoes? I have had too much to drink. You had too much of whiskey today, eh? - I had too much of whiskey... but the police arrived at the last minute. And everything was spoilt. Alright, bye. Hi Mike. - Yes. How does the police arrive at the last minute everywhere, these days? Do you know? I just heard that John was arrested. John arrested? - Yes! He was an old friend. What's happening? I hope the police hasn't appointed a special officer from Calcutta. Something strange is surely happening. I think so. Get my shoes. Get my shoes. You are hurt in the leg. I think your shoes must have changed in the police station. The measurements of the shoes I make is smaller. The measurement of the shoes you wear is bigger. No. It's just an illusion! Your measurements are all right. Get my shoes. So, you've come. Where's Mike? - Mike's changing his shoes. You resemble Mike a lot. But you are a cop. You know everything about this place. You can't escape now. What are you saying? When you came here, John was arrested. Roshanara and Seth were arrested. You killed Philip. Tell me, who you are. Ching Lee, you are an intelligent man. I am the same person you guessed about. You...? - So, you have killed Ching Lee, too. No. He tried to kill me first. I have seen and heard everything. Tell me who you are? Me! I am your Mike! - Shut up! I have understood everything. You have deceived me. You conned me by playing the game of love. Tell me the truth, who are you? Or, you will be dead before I count five. Susie. - One.. - Susie. - Two. - Susie. - Three. No need to count. I know you can't shoot at me. Because you love Mike a lot. I agree that I'm not Mike. But I'm Mike's brother. Mike's brother? - Yes. We are twins. He was kidnapped by these gangsters in childhood. Mike's now in jail. I'm helping the police posing as Mike. You loved me thinking I was Mike. But I've never taken advantage. If I help them catch the gangsters. Mike can go scoot free. The police will free him? - Yes, Susie. I've done a lot of work. There still some important work left. If you truly love Mike... You've got to help me for the sake of Mike, the law and the society. Even before Susie can help you, we have come to your aid. Your game is up, Police Officer! Take him away! Come, Susie. Come, doctor. - Mike's condition is deteriorating. I think we'll have to move him to a hospital. He hasn't revealed anything as yet. How can we shift him in this condition? You know better. But if something happens to him.. ...you'll be responsible. Doctor, is there no other way? - Absolutely not. Mr. Sen, what do you think? - The doctor's right. It's not good to take such risks. All right. I'll make arrangements to shift him to the hospital. Get me ambulance department. Hey, have you gone blind? Get up. Shekhar, it's you. Shekhar. Get up. Shekhar, Shekhar. Come to your senses, Shekhar. - Where am I? Who are you? - It's me, Rita. Yes. Your Rita. Shekhar.. Rita.. Shekhar, what's the matter? What shall I do now? - Let's call the doctor. No, we can't. Or, everybody will know. We'll have to do something or the other. Rita. Say something Shekhar. Does it hurt? Go get some hot milk. Alright. - Give it to me. Rita. - Yes, Shekhar. There's no need to fear now. How did I come here? - You were lucky that I was passing by. I wonder what would have happened to you in the rains. So, you saved my life. - Yes, Shekhar. Now tell me, where's your Inspector Dutta. Inspector Dutta? - Yes, Inspector Dutta. He used to boast a lot, that he would make something out of you. Did you realise now, that they don't care for your life? Yes. You are right. I warn you. Whatever you say, I will not let you go to China Town. There's no need of posing as Mike now. Keshto is attending to your father. How can I get the milk? Take care of him. I'll get the milk. - Alright. Keshto! Keshto! Keshto. Yes, madam. - Is Daddy, asleep? - Yes. What's the matter? I need a glass of hot milk. - Milk...? - Wait. I'll get it. Hello, police station. Can I speak to Inspector Dutta? Yes, Dutta speaking. I'm Rita here. Do you know what happened to Shekhar because of you? Shekhar. What happened? - I found him injured! You found him? How is he now? He'll never work for you again, remember that! Hello! Hello! Constable, get the jeep. - Yes, sir. Shekhar, you're smoking. Give it to me. Have this milk. I called Inspector Dutta and told him.. ...that you'll not work for him again. You told him that I'm here. - Am I scared of them? Is he coming here? - They'll keep coming to convince you. But don't listen to them. Don't get fooled by their talk. Rita. Rita. If they come here, I won't be able to refuse. But I'll tell them you're not here. They'll search every nook and corner. We'd rather hide elsewhere. But you're not well...! Don't worry about me. I have friends who can hide me. But how can I leave? - Don't lose heart. Come with me. The gangsters will be caught soon. Then I'll come back to you. Come, drop me at my destination. Come with me. Where have you brought me? - I'll let you know, very soon. Wong! You! Didn't you recognise me? - Mike! When did you escape from jail? - Jail...? Mike? So, you're not Shekhar. I am not. I'm Mike. Wong, this is Rita. She thought I was Shekhar. That's why I'm here now. Scoundrel! You deceived me! - Shut up! We were deceived first. Shekhar resembles you, Mike. But we have realised the truth now. Boss has given orders to finish him. No! Where is he now? - In the torture chambers. Good. You take care of her and I'll take care of him. - No! Come on inside. Come on. What work do you do here? - I'm the gardener here. Where's Rita? - She's already left. Where to? - I don't know. She came in with a gentleman with a beard. He's injured. What was his name? His name was Shekhar. She went away with him. She is gone.. The swine has taken her to China Town. - Let's hurry! You! You do resemble me a lot. But do I call you Mike or Shekhar? Shekhar. But your true name is also not Mike. It's Shankar. From when do you know my true identity? - From childhood. Good. Good. So, you've come to take advantage of my childhood or my resemblance? I risked my life here. I am proud of your daring, my courageous enemy. I have nothing against you, I am against the gangsters of China Town. Mike's other name is China Town. And the result of the enemies of China Town... Is before my eyes. My handcuffed hands. If that's your wish, then here... Your enemy is facing you now. Go ahead... I can't raise my hands, Shankar. We belong to the same parents who were gifted with twins. One is Shekhar, that is me. The other is Shankar, that is you. I have heard that story earlier, from an old lady. That old lady is our mother. We are true brothers. I know how to treat my brother. Say brother. I had promised mother... I had promised .. ...that after getting the gangsters of China Town arrested.. What will you do? I'll beg the law to set you free. Anything else? Shankar.. If you think I'm lying .. ...to you to gain your sympathy and save my life... Then you can kill me! I won't let you die so easily. Every drop of your blood... will help me avenge police atrocities. Mike, he is your brother. - Move. No, Mike. No! So, he's managed to trap you, too. - No, Mike. No! If he wanted, he could take advantage of our love. But he didn't do that. He stayed away from me. Believe me, he's your brother. How do you know? - Victor and Wong told me. That they kidnapped you. Yes, Shankar. Try to recollect... 20 years ago... One stormy night... we were sleeping together... Wong and Victor snatched you away from mother... and mother kept calling out for you. 'Don't take my child away! Shankar! Shankar!' 'Move back.' 'Shankar! Shankar!' Just embrace me once... Shankar, if human relations are alive.. You'll know we have the same blood. In the heart of your hearts, you'll realise that I'm your brother. You are my brother! Forgive me. Shekhar.. - Shankar.. My dear brother. We have very little time. Boss has given orders to finish him. As long as I am there, no one can touch him. Come with me. You stay here, quietly. Susie, take care of Shekhar. I'll go get Rita. Rita...? How do you know her? - She thought I was Shekhar. I could escape here because of her. Don't worry. She's safe. I'll tell you everything later. I have to go now. Take care. Mike, did you kill the spy? Yes, yes. But where are you taking her? - I told the boss everything. He has asked me to get her. - But there's no way from here. Through the private tunnel. - Private tunnel? Yes. Even I didn't know of it, until the boss told me. Let's go. Come on. Why did you let him go? - We can follow them... and reach the boss. Today, I've got the opportunity... to avenge my father's death. Susie, go and inform the police. - No. I want to be with you. Go! Okay, I'll go. Susie, I have always shown hatred towards you... But believe me, if I come out alive, I'll reciprocate your love. Mike.. - Yes, Suzie. Go. The sound of water can be heard. You stay here, I'll go. - No. I'll come along. This is my business. Stay here. I'll go. Wong! - Mike! Mike! Mike! Come to your senses, Mike! - I already have. You kidnapped me from my mother's arms. You made her weep throughout her life. It's because of you that I will spend my lifetime in prison. Rita! Shekhar! Shekhar! Rita.. He's my twin brother, Shankar. I've killed Wong. Now, we'll have to face the boss. You've got to help us. - Yes, Rita. I am ready to give my life for you, Shekhar. Since this was the only chance to serve you.. ...I didn't want to miss it. The lady's unconscious. - Lay her up on the table. Now, you go back to your place. What do I make of this behaviour? That I'm not the same Mike who danced to your tunes. But Shankar is facing you now. Shankar. Your men kidnapped me in my childhood... killed my father. I have come to avenge my father's death today. Do you know that we consider prying minds as betrayers? And the punishment for betrayal is... So, you're not unconscious. You switched off the lights! Do you think you can escape with my secret? Never! Come on. Shankar.. Don't worry about me. I'm only hurt in the arm. The police will be arriving soon. Go and save Rita. But what about you? - Leave! Shekhar. Shekhar. Shekhar. I'm not Shekhar, but Shankar. Mike. Mike? - Mike? I was waiting for you. The boss has escaped with Rita. Shekhar's following them. Hurry and save my brother's life. Inspector, you take charge. Beware! Sit quietly or I'll shoot you. Watch it! Where to...? Leave me. - Yes, I will. Shekhar? Shekhar! Over here... hurry inspector. Don't worry. Arrest the scoundrel! Congratulations, Shekhar. - Thank you, Inspector. Shekhar! Rita. Mother, don't cry. A three-year term is no big deal for an evil man to mend his ways. Shankar. Wait for me, if possible. Mike.. This is not the time to weep and cry, but to smile... Smile... The next time you come, I would like to heard the good news... that I can call Rita my sister-in-law. I'll take the responsibility. - Promise me, father-in-law. But first you promise me that you won't sing in hotels anymore. There's no need to. I work for the police now. If you work for the law, who'll look after my daughter? The whole of the police force! Time is up. Come on, dear. Let's go, sister. Good luck, Shekhar. - Thank you. Good luck.
