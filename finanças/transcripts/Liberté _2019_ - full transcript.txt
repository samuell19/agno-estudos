Do you know about Damien? The poor man who tried to assassinate Louis XV. I was there when they dragged him from his cell. He had been tortured for many days. They had used pincers... and boiling oil. He was no longer recognisable when they brought him out. I watched from my balcony as they tied each of his limbs to four separate horses. The poor man was about to be ripped apart in public. The crowd enjoyed the show. The man howled so much that, several times, I had to turn away from his screams. And you know I have a taste for these things. The horses pulled in different directions, slowly quartering him. Each limb was ripped from his body. But his tendons were tough. Seeing he was a robust fellow, men joined in with knives. They cut away each tendon. This helped the process along. Finally, half of his body... tore away. And in the end, all that was left was his head. Still screaming. From the chest down, his body was torn into many pieces. But the man was still alive. Still conscious. And his screams were particularly... terrifying. Even I had to put a handkerchief to my ears to muffle the cries of this poor man. But from my balcony, I saw three people who never once turned away. Who seemed to have a particularly refined taste for the horror of this vision. They were three women, whom you may know. The Duchesse de Laurence, her daughter and her sister. These three women appeared fascinated by the spectacle before them. They never sought to turn away from the sight of this man, despite its monstrous nature, as I've explained. You know our situation. We had to flee the French court. And now we're quite alone. Our friends are few, as are the places we feel safe. We need women such as these to help us. I believe the revolution is no longer in the hands of... our friends, our former friends, certain debauched individuals. It's women like these, obstinate, tough... They know the price one must pay to change the world. Ever since we left the court, we've had to stay in somewhat... uninviting places. Any encounters are rare and sometimes dangerous. No one quite understands the vision we are defending. You understand, of course. We share the same interests. What exactly is it that you need? You chose to come here. You must have a reason. What is it? We need you, Duke. We need you to help us... to find women such as these. The French court is against us. Perhaps Frederick II will show us more benevolence. I doubt it. Libertinage is difficult here. Listen... We must hurry. Our time is running out. We need to find support and help in Prussia. Quickly. You say all we need is strong men, strong women. That's not how it works. I will see if I can find someone in the court of Frederick II who knows about such things. Then I can relay it to him. But it's rather difficult at the moment. Is there anything you would wish for? Or that you desire? Perhaps we could provide it for you. No, thank you. I see to that myself. Would you like to stay here in the woods? In this... cursed place? That it is. Have you observed something here, Duke? No, I don't need to. We would be very honoured if you would join us. You are persistent. I already said no. Please leave me in peace. We need this balm. This balm made of shit... and of dirt. When she sweats, the shit will penetrate her body. You will get drunk on wine. Then you will piss. You will piss out the wine. Show me the pissing instrument. Show it to me. Yes, that will work. We'll put the piss in here. Then we will let the piss flow into her body. Through the arsehole. And you and you will come into her mouth. Don't waste a drop. Last time, we put the shit in her mouth. But she did not swallow it. She's splendid. Her body will be the shrine of our world. - Do you know her? - I've seen her here before. Do you want to fondle her? Yes, Madame. Dry your tears. Let me describe a scene that would be most pleasurable for me. The Count will help me execute it soon. He will bring an animal. A young calf. I'll plunge my dick in its nostril. Very deeply. The animal will go wild. He'll lick my sack. Can you imagine the scene? Yes? Yes. And what role will you play in it? I'll hold the animal's head steady while you fill it. And, with the other hand, I shall hold his large willing member. You have a weak imagination. Poor girl. But very well, if that is your wish. I've noticed your neck. Let me see it! It is well attached. It would be exquisite to snap. Reserve that pleasure for me. They are real men. Anything you can give me, they give me a hundredfold. Do you want to see it now? Have you ever heard a pig have its throat severed? My screams, with him inside me... are even louder. Look at me. Look at me! Imagine the two of them. I'll let you observe for a moment. Pure, naïve... Conversations here are open. Humiliated by you. Wide open. I'm sure you have grand plans for them. Always eager to go further. Always. I like their demeanour. One has the voice of a child. - Imagine the words... - Are they only speaking? ...or the screams it could emit. Are they praying? The other looks a little lost. But deep down, she knows what she wants. She knows. That is her purity. That she knows, deep down. They look well built. That is why we shouldn't wait. They seem to have a good time. They have not yet taken their vows. - Then it's not too late. - No. They will resist. It's likely. The convent is well guarded. I fear it will be dangerous for us. I don't want to endanger myself or you in this business. Kidnapping may not be the wisest solution. Why this opposition? You know the reasons. The King holds the abbess in high esteem. Kidnapping is a crime. It would be a great risk. It is the crime that should excite you. Indeed. Your patience harms you! If the kidnapping does not excite you, they will be disappointed. We'll find other ways to relieve their... disappointment, as you put it. No. If we try to convince them over time, they won't want to come. They would think us cowards. There's no danger of that. They are waiting to be pierced. They are waiting to be torn, to be punctured. They are waiting for this, eagerly and fervently. No! Immediate kidnapping is the only way! I want them here as much as you do. I've seen them. I know very well the qualities they each possess. I want to enjoy them. But leave this to us. - They will be delivered to you... - I'd rather not be noticed for now. When would you like to proceed? What do you think of this sky? It's beautiful. We must bring them here! But covenant walls are formidable, not like the walls of the inn. Do you think that's why they came? We need a plan, people we can trust. We could try to enter in disguise. I must confess... that's not the only reason. We must have some accomplices inside. I think I understand... It would be easier. But... We will find some. ...I'm afraid that we will be seen. Did you hear that? Yes. Do you want to go look? No. They know we're coming to take them. They are waiting. They're waiting because they want it. They are ready. They are thirsty and hungry. They know, but it is an obscure knowledge. We must not disappoint them. Yes, but that is... just your dream. It's only because I dream that we will be able to take them. I understand. But what are your plans for them? You're so eager to retrieve them. I don't want to touch them immediately. I want to tie them to that tree. I want to climb the tree. And watch. Watch as the dogs are released. Ravenous... to bite them. Are you not afraid of spoiling them? The moment they are retrieved? They will feel... the evil. As if they themselves... had caused it. They look safe in there. Everything you have felt before... they feel it, blindly. Because we're all the same... How do you feel about being here and not in there? There are no exceptions. They will understand soon enough. We all have the same organs. I feel like prey. And we use them in a similar way. We recently met the Duc de Walchen. The poor man seemed lost in... Perhaps soon you won't anymore. ...humiliating deliberation. I told him of our interests, of our business. He was detached... I don't hear what they're saying. ...vague... His words lacked substance, intrigue, desire... I believe he's become a coward. He thinks he can simply repent of his years of debauchery. - We must find someone. - Who do you have in mind? Do you know Mademoiselle de Rubens? Yes. She has just got out of a Negro brothel. The years spent there have left her half crazy. With a sort of erotic fury. She would be capable of anything. If you put a knife in her hand, I believe she will do it willingly. Do it! I shall leave you. I'll be back shortly. What would you be willing to do with him? There's something about his wounds that inspires great cruelty. I want to make him suffer even more. To work deeply on his scars. I would pour boiling oil on him. This oil could leave an even deeper scar on the inside. Uglier than that which is visible on the skin's surface. You scare me. Weak men deserve to be brought to their knees. That's what they cry out for, anyway. And I can't ignore that cry. Do you not fear God's punishment? I leave my fate in His hands. God's perversion is one I should like to experience. What did he say to you? I daren't repeat it. After all, we're in the convent. But I'm sure you follow my thoughts. Do you think they've already forgotten you and left? I can't hear them anymore. I shall keep quiet. I shall listen. Perhaps we shall hear their voices, their moans again... somewhere. Dearest Duke. I am very pleased to see you. And I you. In these poisoned woods. Listen... I saw Mademoiselle de Geldöbel leaving your carriage. Just a moment ago. Correct? Yes. Why? Does she often come to see you at night in the woods? - Yes. - Yes. What is wrong with that? Nothing at all, Duke. I am just happy to see you. And to know that you are meeting with girls. These sorts of girls. Tell me, do you think that Mademoiselle de Geldöbel... is ready to leave the convent? I don't know. She said nothing? No, not to me. Do you think she may be disposed... to the cause? She needs to decide. Before it's too late. We shall see. We must be quick and shrill. Like a scream. Do you understand, Duke? Listen... I have another, more delicate question. Mademoiselle de Geldöbel... does she have the sickness? You don't know? She didn't say anything? Not to me. Maybe she has it but doesn't know. But... Did you see that? A sort of animal just passed by, no? Usually... they are here. Behind the trees. Beautiful. Naked, too. They give themselves willingly. - Yes? - Yes. Strange. Here, Duke, the second novice. Use this time to say what you have to say. To express... what you cannot express there. Bring forth those words. I would rather not use words. Very good, Mademoiselle de Jensling. Very, very good. - That's it. - Don't be afraid. Take it. Caress it. Run your fingers around it. That's it. Be gentle! I am. And be thorough. Why have you lured me here? You know very well, Mademoiselle de Jensling. Come... Give me more! Flood me with it! Release me! I don't care for the expression of pleasure on a woman's face. It is too deceiving. I prefer the expression of pain. It is unmistakable. I don't know if he's actually lost. Or just pretending. I don't trust these people. They expect something... more. I didn't take you for a coward. I'm not a coward, I am cautious. It's a strange place to leave one's valet. Does your lady have as much imagination as you? He does not wish to answer at this time. Perhaps he is a genuine fool? I don't think so. Sir? That's it. What are you doing? I heard a noise. Look at him. Don't be afraid. Kneel down. There you go. Good. Gentle strokes... Take the other leg. Start from the bottom. That's it. Try to engage him with your touch. Look at him. Undress him. His mistress must be of a delicate nature. What does that matter to us? She must not touch him often. He wants to be touched. We are here with him. That's all that matters. Put your hands on his body. Yes, that's it. Caress him! Hold his face. You remain silent. I'm watching you. Watch him. Watch him. Watch him closely. Look. Don't move. Take this blade. You will do it for France. To free the kingdom's youth. Do it harder! More! More? Yes! Hard. You slap like a child! Hit harder! More? Please! - Yes? - Yes. Do it harder! Show me your arse. Yes? More? - More? - Yes! Look! - More? - Yes! Is that enough, Mademoiselle? Yes? You swine! Give it to me! Give it to me, I order you! Give it to me! Don't be more ridiculous than me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Be generous! I order you! Be generous! Open it! Yes! Open the gates! Open the gates to hell! Stay! Stay! Go on! She is one of the greatest actresses you ever met. She will teach you to be an agent as well as a patient. You will learn a lot from her. Look at my breasts. I can't any more! Touch yourself. Grip it tightly. Tighter! What's the matter with you? I've been bathed in come and you dare do this to me? Show me your rod. I want to see what evil is happening to it. Why is it so idle today? Are you no longer capable of fucking me? I like to be fucked. Get out! You're useless. Any monkey could get harder than you. Insist! I'm bored! - I'm offering you my arse, now! - Yes! Open it! - Go on! - Open the... What are you waiting for? Why won't you fill it? Get it out and do it! Do it! Get all this come out for me! Finally! Resurrect your virile member. I'm not Christ. - You deserve to be punished. - No. Lick! Do you think he's satisfied? I believe so. He's smiling like a fool. Perhaps he needs to go even further. He hasn't been hard for a while now. That doesn't matter. This is all internal. Do you understand? I prefer to rely on what I can see. Imagine... Imagine the invisible. All I see is his limp member. You would have liked to see her, I'm sure. But I couldn't wait any longer. The urgency was too... precious for me. It was a beautiful ceremony. Slow. Painful. Unprecedented for the poor girl. Everything was so clear. The smallest detail of her skin. No noise to conceal her moans. And she moaned a lot. She screamed... Even begged at times. Some pleasures she recognised. But many she didn't expect. Her body responded frankly. She held out for as long as she could. But she's not a slight girl, and the valet holding the rope must have been suffering, too. She asked to be flogged. I know you value that sort of pleasure. Seeing her in that position made me sick. I left her there. Drenched and naked in the forest. These poor devotees don't realise that the man they admire the most knew pleasure only too well. Perhaps not those of the flesh. But, in his last days, those of the whip and of crucifixion. These are particularly refined torments. And I believe that this man, perhaps more than any of us, knew true happiness. To be satisfied, just before death, with such rich and voluptuous pleasures. But that's irrelevant. As you know, I have little affection for this figure. Or for those who worship him. As she is whipped, she should feel... forsaken. As he did. On the cross. And the pleasure should rise from the depths of this abandonment. She should be taken from behind to truly feel Christ's abandonment. The whip would not suffice. You're too delicate with such women. It is from behind that this will come upon her. And... while you're taking her from behind, I want her to moan with pleasure until she throws up. Until she vomits. And then while she is being taken from behind as you describe, I want you to kiss her. To swallow her vomit. And to present it to me later... by shitting it out. Very good. Finally, an image that satisfies me. Your imagination does not disappoint. Forgive me for having doubted you. Above all, we must ensure that none of her blood falls to the ground. Why? It is contaminated blood. We will worship it. We must hold a service with this blood. Look at me!
