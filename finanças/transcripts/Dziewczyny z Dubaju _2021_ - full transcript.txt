I fucked them all. He fucked me so good that I had his initials tattooed on my neck. Misery me! What do you say when they shag you from behind? What should I say? MARIANNA I know him too. Tomeczek, the record breaker. Is his dick that huge? MARIANNA Do you know how much mother squeezed out of him last year? Hmm? MARIANNA Some 150 grand. A true patron. He loves hookers, I wouldn't be surprised if he married one someday. Marianna, it seems everybody who's on telly fucked you already. Remember one thing, darling. It's not them fucking us, but us fucking them. The cab's waiting, philosopher. EMI Can I ask you a question? Only be honest. How much would a man have to pay you for sleeping with him? One thousand dollars? Ten thousand? You don't have to say it out loud. Just be honest with yourself. Be honest, please. What's your price? What if it's more than you earn in a year? Or five years? Be honest. What if it paid your college tuition? Or the operation that saves your mother's life? What if they're handsome? Very handsome. What if it's someone you'd crave anyway? EMI And the most important thing: EMI What if nobody ever finds out? One, two, three zlotys. Four, four fifty. It's still two fifty short. One fifty more. Mom, couldn't you lend me some from the cash box? Are you crazy? It's only one 50, nobody will know. I'll know, you'll know, the Lord will know. Misery me. So, you won't help me with the ticket to Szczecin? You better forget about Szczecin! Don't forget you have English at 5:00 p.m.! CAR DRIVER Hey, Missy, show your titties! Call. Shit, I don't have any more to raise. You can always take something off. What could I for 20? Everything. You fucking lost it! Come on, don't be so shy! Easy. As you wish. All right. Add 30, and I'll strip off everything. Sure... everything. Holy fuck. Boys, fundraiser! BOY #3 I'm broke. Six zlotys. Fuck, we only have 26, all right? All right. So, Missy... show your titties! I'm sorry boys, maybe next time. See ya! Bye! EMI I earned for a ticket to Szczecin. It was a drop in the ocean, though. That's me. My name is Emi. They call me Missy because I won the beauty pageant in eighth grade. I haven't been able to repeat that feat. This time, it was supposed to be different. If I had all the money in the world... I don't know. I never had any. I didn't have enough to pay the entry fee and one gentleman lent me 20 zlotys. Thank you! So, if I had all the money in the world... I'd give it all away and everybody would get the same share. Thanks and applause for candidate no. 7. Maybe then, for one day, people would stop thinking that money matters. You can give away all the money you want if you don't touch mine. Or better spend it on a pair of more reliable stilettos. DOROTA Very soon... the stage will belong to the one and only vision of beauty, Marianna Kinia, Miss Spring 1999. Applause! I'm such a loser. Please don't cry. You're not a loser. I see a beautiful woman. A beautiful woman in one shoe. It was you. You paid my entry fee. I didn't even thank you. I'm so sorry. Beautiful women don't need to apologize. Besides, I didn't pay. I allowed myself to make a small investment. Thank you anyway. You made communism charming. Misery me, I can't remember what I said. That's a pity. It was so refreshing to hear something else than world peace. Dimitri. Emi. Hungry? Yummy. What's that? Raw fish. I can see that the prince found our Cinderella. Hi, my name is Marianka. I know. Miss Marianna Kinia. I'm your idol. Look how sweet you are. And you'd like to be Miss, too? It rather won't happen. You know what I think? You need only a tiny bit of sex-appeal to really believe in yourself. Exactly. A true Miss must be a real woman. To make it in the show business you would need to learn really hard. First, you need to grow up. Will you grow up or come back to backwoods to dream of the big world? Well, it didn't even sting. Great. Know what? I like you. I and my mum help girls like you. Remember, you can earn big money. Beautiful, isn't she? Mm-hmm. You could be just like her. You're not inferior to her. I could help you if you wish. How? Are you a virgin? No. Ow! It hurts! But I love you, Emi! Fuck, I love you too. Wait! Technically, I am. I could, technically, be your prince. You'd earn money for new shoes. How does that sound? I'm not one of those. Really? Keep your hands off her! - She's only seventeen. - Mum! She's seventeen, got it? I call the police, it is illegal. Calm down, ma'am, it won't be needed. Please! What are you doing here?! Quiet! We're leaving. Now! Please take it easy, ma'am. It's a respected contest. Nothing bad happens here. I can see what's going on here. Of course. It's covered by the press. We're choosing Miss Spring and your daughter has got... talent. And a chance of her lifetime. Talent. You must study, you don't need talent. Would you let your daughter do such things? Marianna, come over. Good evening. Marianna Kinia. And that's my mum. You see? We do people no harm. How could you do that? Such a shame! You should be ashamed. You don't help me. I took an extra job, stacking shelves at night. Stacking shelves? I know you sleep with the manager. You snot! My skin flakes because of that drudgery. You only condemn me and they say I've got talent. Talent! Have you ever won anything? Huh? Examples. Have you won a candy at least? I haven't because I tripped. If I only had other shoes... You want other shoes, earn for them. EMI Mom, I need to search for my moon, call you. That's how my new life began. EMI The road seemed to be straight, just like that hallway. I didn't even realize that I entered a labyrinth. My mother will kill me for whoring. Whoring? Whores walk the streets. They have no choice. You have one: you can say yes or no. What's your problem? You like him, fuck him, and make him pay. - Business with pleasure. - Right! You can be a cowed hag from the woods who thinks her body is a sanctuary of fuck or a girl who enjoys her life and makes good use of it. Ow! What are you doing? I'm putting your nipples up. It makes men go crazy. Go! Go! EMI That's how I found my vocation. I was really good at it. And I learned pretty quickly. It was like changing from a scooter to a Formula 1 car. DOROTA You got the money? Uh-huh. How was it? It wasn't that bad. Excellent. That half is mine. The second half covers your room and drinks at the bar. You take it all? So, far you stayed for free at my place. Enough of that. I'm not your mother, I'm your friend. Don't forget, Emi, nothing's for free. Men pay for a date. All other things are paid extra. EMI Like what? You play dead and everything apart from lying there like a fallen tree is paid extra. DOROTA He wants anal. Extra charge. DOROTA He wants to be cuddled and cry in your arms. Paid extra. DOROTA The guy wants a threesome with his wife. Paid extra. DOROTA Gangbang... And how's your kid? You know what it's like. Kindergarten, viruses, that stuff... Fucking awesome. You know how she helps footballers? Polishes their balls! DOROTA The most expensive of them all... No kissing. I must kiss you. Two grand. You have matured, Cinderella. Practice makes perfect. DOROTA Happiness... like drops of sweat on the skin. Happiness like sand... it whispers. It's beautiful. It doesn't even rhyme. It's haiku, moron. It doesn't have to rhyme. Fuck, you know nothing About the Japanese. Marianka, see those chicks? How can we get there? We aren't worse than them. Forget about it. It's like if you wanted to fly to the moon. EMI Misery me, you talk like my mother. Quick bites with a small spoon are better. You'll eat but won't choke. I got it! Happiness whispers like sand yet you won't buy anything for it. A new Szymborska. You bet I am. I will make a career. It gave me a boner. Poetry is better than Viagra. Stay close, always at hand today. I want to smell you. I don't understand why you're doing it. I like to control what I have paid for. Ten grand? Count it if you don't trust me. I asked you why you record everything? That's my hobby. What's yours? Your dough is my hobby. What about switching partners, Dimitri. I pay and enjoy my privileges. EMI Such bookings are, you know... Paid extra! I'll be back in a second. I'm coming with you. You go to powder you nose? I've got some awesome powder. All right. I wear no panties. So do I. MARIANNA Tell me how's my face? Hasn't coke ruined it? No way. I love that stuff, but it gives me cellulite. I dehydrate and the shit appears on my legs. Madam. Uh, I'm sorry, what is this? This is the high limits poker room. The buy in is 10,000. We were supposed to go powder our noses. Remember the guy from the yacht? Fuck, I could change light bulbs with my feet when I see him. Exactly. It's my mother's dough. Who gives head? Her or you? Right this way, ladies. Mr. Epstein, I have two lovely ladies. - Can they join you at the table? - Yes, please. Hello! Hello! Where are you from? From my mother. Are we playing or are we talking? Let's play. Sure. Off. Don't touch your nose, tonight we got bad cards. Otherwise, you won't get much. You are talking to a man who makes a living out of keeping secrets. Remind me not to trust you with my secrets. I raise. Andre, raise. - How much sir? - 25,000. All in. And your 25 against one night with my friend. Why not with you? Because she is a cover girl and I'm not. Okay. I fold. Have fun. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! It was 10,000 fucking dollars. You cunt! It was an investment. You ruined everything, stupid bitch! Dimitri won't see you anymore. He cut us off! He got us every client that we had. You saw that yacht! Politicians don't have such boats! You don't even know them fuckers. Marianka will blaze a trail. You sell my daughter's ass? You think you can be me? You lost your fucking mind! Jesus! One cheap whore ruined my entire business. Fucking shit. Why did I harbor you? Hi. How was it? He was divine. Did he pay? No. You'll whore around until you pay me back the last penny. Excuse me. - Are you Miss Emi? - Yes. Mr. Sam would like to see you in the hotel cafe. Huh, thank you. What's up? The guy from the yacht wants to meet me. You'll introduce us. Let's go! Marianna, you'll translate. And you keep your mouth shut! Hi. Hello. My name is... I'm Lady D. I know you know my girls. Excuse me, who are you? That's Dorota, my partner and of course you know Marianka already. Yes, of course. Well, ladies, huh. Thank you for your service. I have a good credit in this hotel. They'd be my guests. Now, if you will excuse me. You fucked it up again! Sam! Did you have a good time with Marianka? A lot better than I expected. If you decide to work with us. You won't regret it. You know, I like it when you are asking. I'm sure this doesn't happen very often. Am I right? My employer and his businessmen are organizing a small party in Courchevel. And one more thing. I only talk to you. Not to them. Yes, yes, yes. They're in the same league with Marianka? Hey, I'm still here! They are all sexy. EMI Being sexy is not enough. They should also have... I don't know, that something. Some flair! I beg you, Kara hunches like a giraffe. Sara! How old are you? Me? Well... Nineteen. What? EMI Saw that chicks they had on the yacht? They don't look for one-night stands. They wanna have good time, something to talk about with the girls. Rose looks as if she sucked 200 cocks. Darling, I sucked 500! Appearances and whores can be deceiving. Men love kitsch. Money is money. A pussy is a pussy. Since your standards are so fucking high, go look for the perfect chicks yourself. - Are you fucking dumb? - Jeez! What's that!? You won't believe it! They called me from a magazine! I'll be on the cover! Jeez, turn down that happiness! Okay. Now! Now! Great, we've got New York. That's good. Be sexy! Walk towards me. Like a kitty. Excellent! Magnificent! The girl from 5:00 p.m. cancelled. Okay, call another one. Look for the best chicks in that notebook. But bring me a latte first. - Want some coffee? - No. Right, cougars don't drink coffee! Beautiful! Hit it! Hit that foam. And more buttocks. More buttocks. Stick it out. Damn beautiful. Give me more. Pussyfoot to me! Uh-huh! PHOTOGRAPHER Wonderful! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! The hair. Brush it aside. That's it! Why waving? Cougars don't wave. EMI Here are the magazines. Check them. If you like a girl, you'll find her number in my black notebook. Here you are. What the fuck, dumb-ass?! What's that milk?! I ordered Turkish coffee. Is that so difficult to understand? Hey, that coffee is for me. Your coke. Thanks a lot. And bring me Turkish coffee. Mm-hmm. Mum? I'll take that. I'm so happy! Me too! Welcome to Warsaw! I bought a news-stand! I have 5,000 left. Keep it. Pamper yourself and buy anything you want! No, it's no use. Take it. Mum, please do something for you only. Come! I found a room with a beautiful view for you. We won't stay together? I do a home stay, there's not enough room for both of us. I work nearby, right around the corner, and will often come over. You've changed. I am blonde now. What are we supposed to do there? Ski, party, visit exclusive joints. Have great fun and earn big bucks! What about sex? You can always say no. Unless a prince invites you. Gals, I saw those guys. They are super-hot and our age. You wouldn't kick them out of bed. It's not for me. I'm Miss Pomerania, not some slut! You aren't a star either! It won't tarnish your halo! Hey, wait. It's going to be a great adventure. What's next Emi? Ready to take someone from me? Or will you continue to act tough? Someone for you, Emi. Mum! Mummy! Please wait, mummy! Leave me alone. Mummy, calm down. Leave me be! Mummy, it's only a photo shoot script! Stop lying to me, snot! You think I don't know what's going on? Do you really think I'm that stupid? Yes, I think that you are stupid! You're always afraid, I'm not. Where am I and where are you? Where do you think the money for the kiosk came from? Sweet Jesus, child, you are... a whore. What have you been? When you fucked with the manager? I loved him. MARIANNA Everything will be fine. You'll be able to buy your mother a house on the seaside. A mother is always a mother. Yours is way better than mine. Nobody can stand her. Even my father. He left home because of her. I didn't even get to know mine. I heard that playing house... wasn't his favorite game. It ain't that bad. Mine used to grab my tits when he came drunk from shows. That were his games. Damn it! Men are pricks. There's no such thing as love. You fucked it up. We only have nine girls. And one of them is bald. KAMILA Wait for me! Emi! There's the tenth one. - Hi. - Hi. She knows the trade? I told her. Without getting into much detail. You'll bring us fucking down. Look at her and the bunnies, nobody will ever choose her. Let's go, Marianka. Your boyfriend? KAMILA Yes, that's Janek. You bet he'll be a star reporter one day. And he lives off you? No, not really. I just support him. Who supports you? You? Well done! That's a correct answer. You have won a holiday in France. My name is Sam. Santino is your host. This is his party. You are his guests. Obey the rules of his house. You do not smoke here. Neither at the presence of gentlemen. Nor behind closed doors or in any place in CoUrchevel. And most important... we do not approach him uninvited. We take that one! C'est magnifique! Misery me! Yeah! Kamila? I don't know what I'm doing here. Darling... You're here to have fun and earn money. Like we talked about it. The girls told me something else. That I will have to... Jeez, come on, don't listen to what those morons say. Unless you like someone. What about Janek? Janek? Wasting your life for just one guy? They are supposed to pay us. This is... What is it? You can say it out loud. You know what it is? I do! We're girls to buy, whores... Of course! All those who envy us will say that. They want to do the same thing, but are afraid to. You know what? We don't give a damn. Come! You have to say it out loud. I don't give a damn! I don't give a damn! I don't give a damn! I don't give a damn! I don't give a damn! I don't give a damn! Look it that! Have you ever been abroad? I've been just like you. I was scared as shit when I was leaving my town. Then I got it. He who doesn't risk never gets to drink champagne. Them? They can drink beer and cheap wine. Without me. Without me either. Emi. The girl in the white top needs to change. Santino doesn't like her. Roxy, you need to change! I don't have anything else. I've got something nice. I'll lend you that. Come. And now, let's party. Let's party! I've... I've never done something like this. With a stranger. I am not a stranger, trust me. My fucking ankles are so fat! Damn it! Who could last for four hours. Maybe she's such a crap. EMI Or that good. Finally, there you are. And how was it? It was... ...the most magical night of my life. Right, cut that crap! I entered his room, not knowing what to expect. But it turned out... ...he only wanted to talk. It turned out quickly we have the same favorite movie. We watched it. Which one? Titanic. And Love Me Tender is his favorite song. He played it for me. And cooked me dinner. What? Is he some fucking pianist? He played a CD. He cooked you dinner. Mhmm. It's one of his passions. I've never met anyone in my life who had so many passions. Mhmm. Did you fuck? - No - No? We made love. Then... ...we lied there and talked. I've never felt such a bond with anyone. She's crazy! And he tipped me. I didn't want it, but he insisted. Guess how much? How much? Two thousand bucks. Well done! You deserved it. Fifty percent for me. I'd say for me. Kamila is my girl. - I'm sorry. - Hey. There's been someone's arrival. But I have something for your reward. Advance... last. Contractual penalty. Fuck up money. Wow. So if business if behind our back, we can finally relax. You know what I like about you, Emi. What? We are the same. If you come from nowhere and you manage to get out does not matter how much time passes that part will stay with you forever. And how do you know, maybe I come from a rich family and I'm just a rebel. You can take the girl out of the fight but you cannot take the fight out of the girl. To rebellions. Fucking bitch. What's wrong with you? Can't you see what's going on? Emi hits on Sam. So what? Think, dumb-ass! They're her clients, her girls. When they realize it, we get the dick end of the stick. That's overstated. Watch and learn. Never miss a chance to stab one's back. Santino, hello! I thought it was you. What a coincidence! Marianka, remember me? I'm Lady D. I mean, call me Dorota. Isn't that strange that we get to talk one on one only now? Jesus, we all in such a hurry. Ruff, ruff. By the way, I noticed that you enjoy the company of my girls. The middlemen, Sam and Emi, trouble me. First time, directly. You've already seen what I can offer, but you don't know what I have in extras. Dorota. Talk, yes? Thank you very much, but maybe we can speak another time. Absolutely. What did he say? He wants us to leave. Will we meet later or he wants us to disappear? He's now wondering why we're still here. Will see you later. See you. No comments. You have to hustle those other guys tonight. What guys? Those who sit with him. The businessmen. Vodka, please. - Mum! - What? They are the direct connection to Santino. Get their attention and down to business. I thought we quit. You promised! You fucked for that slut. But not for us? You know it was something else. Fuck, we're broke, your father's gone. Your fucking duty is to support your mum. You have to save the family. I'd have done it myself if I were younger. Grow up finally, dumb-ass. I gotta talk to you. Let's cut the bullshit. Do not a and Marianna approached Santino during a business meeting with important people in a public place. And that's against the rules. Fucking shit! But it was behind my back. I don't care. You're fired. You should look at your face right now. I got you. It was a joke? I'm half-Italian. Nobody's perfect. You motherfucker! In ten years... I will be rich beyond belief and every weekend, I'll bring young boys, of course from Eastern Europe Obviously. On my Yacht. And me and all my girlfriends. We will have a lot of fun. Sounds like a plan. But I'm talking about, like um... What are your plans like, husbands, kids, family? You know, people like us, we have hearts of ice. And maybe we should warm them up. Then they will melt, and we will be heartless. I have to disagree. Is this private or professional? What's got into you to hit on Carlito and Bahir? I hoped I'll turn them on, Santino learns about it and becomes jealous. Jeez, we need to respect ourselves! You damaged everything. They'll probably kick us out. And quit drinking! And you cunt? Playing tricks? Cutting me off? Where's Marianka? Not your business. And I'm not. I know you're plotting something. Listen Emi, Sam gets a hefty share. Who needs him anyway? I know we're here thanks to you. Think how much we can earn if we join our forces. All we got from you and we got from me. Don't forget Marianka. Just imagine us three and Santino. Sam's share is none of your business. Santino wants him and we're here thanks to him. Show loyalty at least once in your life. He cooked for me, I my played my favorite music. And we talked all the time. Was there any sex? You bet. Twice! You're crazy! Marianka! Everything's okay? Girls, out! Did you talk business? They didn't give damn about it. Don't forget sweetheart... sex is ephemeral and illusory. What we do at night is just a dream during daytime. You know what I'm talking about? EMI Sometimes you feel totally in control, not afraid of anything. And that the world is yours. In most cases nothing is what you take it for. Before you say something, I'd like to apologize for what happened... Emi, don't apologize. Just let me explain you... Carlito and Bahir are my brothers. It's okay. And we have a nice surprise for you. Happy Birthday! - Happy birthday. - Open. Like it? Louboutin. Wow, I am very surprised, thank you. You shouldn't be surprised. Your girls are wonderful. And they act like women who do not have to prove anything to anyone. I admire that. Of course, they're from Poland. Well, I don't know a lot about Poland. But from where I'm from, we say that women and horses are the most beautiful creatures of Allah. And Poland is famous for both of them. Come. Come here. I like that. Gucci. Yeah. I like Gucci. You know Emi, I like you a lot. I think you are a very hard working woman. And that is why, I would like to invite you and 50 of your girls to my yacht in Cannes. But there are some conditions. You must have new girls. No repetitions. No problem. This is also about Dorota and Marianna. But they are my partners... You don't need them. You should get rid of them. I won't make it without them. Emi, you are great without them. Trust me. EMI It sounds like cheap consoling when a woman tells you that, right? Only when you hear that from a man you start to believe it. How can I put two inside? One after the other. Like a tampon. Good that you're so skinny. Nobody will notice the money. Girls. I have to tell you something. What have you... You lost your fucking mind? You won't get fucked by anybody! Stop it! She looks good! EMI What would you like to tell us? I won't fuck anymore. I'll let others fuck for me. Even double-teamed? EMI I wasn't afraid of anything anymore. Even walking through the airport With half a million dollars in cash on you. You have to be self-confident. You were gorgeous! Did you convince anyone? Two are willing. Uh-huh! The one in turban requires some work. Watch your step, moron! I'm terribly sorry. Should I hold it for you? Excuse me? The photographs. No... thank you. I have to go. You'll now see the last photograph of the Herrero women. Whom my foundation took under its wing. Her tribe rejected her. She would have died without our help. That is why we collect funds for cleaning supplies and food. The reserve price is 5,000 zlotys. Those dickheads have too much money to squander. They should spend more on Polish girls. Were at 7,000 ladies and gentlemen. I hope it will encourage you to bid. You weren't able to afford shoes when you came. Anyone helped you? Gave money for nothing? 13,000! Now you only have too... 30,000! Ladies and gentlemen, it's 30,000! Applause! 30,000! Going once, going twice, sold! To the beautiful lady in the front row. You lost it too? I can afford more than just shoes now. Good morning. Good morning. These are for you, ma'am. Thank you. You look terrific. Cool car. Thank you. Made of steel from allies' tanks. You take a girl for a first date in a tank? How dare you. Let's take mine. Jump in, kid! Oh, gosh! His name is Cefir. - May I? - Sure. Don't be afraid. Touch him. I mean it. He can sense your emotions. Trust him. I'm not good at it. It's new for him as it is for you. Right? He's so beautiful. So? Will you try to tame him? Well done! You see? You can do it! All right, girls. Let's go. We're not working, we're partying here. Oh, yeah! Hey! Girls, will you take me for that trip? Of course, darling! I always thought that you're loaded with cash. Girl, please. This is Poland. I can't afford shooting a video. The outfit is rented. Insane! I know how your business works! I could be the best, without connections I'll never make it from TV to film. And even if they do, any given guy gets twice as much as I do. Fuck, your fans believe that you earn millions. That's the way it is. Hey, come with us. Give it a try. Who knows? You might even fall in love. You know, I hate this whole consumerism. That's why I want to help others. I will never sell my soul. Making money is okay. But who said you must earn it for you only? Exactly! My best case had so far been discovering a beautiful girl from a small town. I found her a job in Warsaw and saw her buying her own apartment. I feel the same. I mean, not about models, but... Supporting others, so they can make it on their own. - Exactly! - Bartek? - Mum... - Good morning. BARTEK This is... Emilia. So glad to meet you. We haven't seen a girl here for ages. You're staying for dinner. But we... Period! Take it. Your father will be happy. Which horse did you ride? Cefir. One of my favorites. A real beauty. Like all Arabs! Like all Arabs! Our family has bred Arabian horses for decades. Darn it! And mosquitos! The most award-winning horses in Europe come from our stud farm. At least in Eastern Europe. Excuse me. Our best horse is called Cefir. His sire, father, had also been born at our stud farm. We hope that Cefir's foals will also stay with us. That's what heritage is about, my son. What is your profession? If I may ask? I run a model agency. Really? I dreamt of being a model. Old times. I create opportunities for young, attractive women, mostly from small towns. I find them and arrange jobs for them. It's so noble of you. I believe that every woman deserves a chance. What does it mean in real life? Models possess something that everyone in the business craves. The possibility to promote and market a brand. The problem is that they're products at the same time. They don't know how to evaluate the product and the market. Excuse me. That's where I, the agency, step in and talk with the clients. So, the girls can focus on creative work. It reminds me of horse breeding. There's even this saying. Allah's finest creatures are women and horses. Poland is famous for both. Nice one, isn't it? Very nice. Where did you hear it? I read it. And where? It must have been Shakespeare. I'll bring apple pie. Let me help you. Please do. Have you finished? Thank you. Thanks. Is that serious? What do you mean? If you want to shag her, do so. She'll be the mother of my children. Wouldn't you like to become a grandpa? Mum would have loved it. Don't you even try to joke like that. I hope I'll make you laugh someday. BARTEK'S MOTHER Here you go. Will you stay for the night? No. We both need to get back to work. BARTEK'S FATHER In the middle of the night? Mm-hmm. You both or only Miss Call Center? Zbyszek! What's your problem? You're wasting your time. I'm wasting time when I do things not connected with horses, right? As long as I finance it, it is so. Excuse me, I have to get back to work. Thanks for the dinner. I'll drive you. Don't bother. Miss Call Center can drive. Goodbye. Kamila! I'm taking you. EMI Leave her alone. She's had enough. Don't fuck up her life. You're ordering her? I love you Kamila. I care for you. I'll find a way. Please. You don't have to. You got no self-respect? I got no self-respect? I got no self-respect?! I only started to realize my worth. You won't get it. Kamila... Leave her alone! - Kamila! - I'm sorry. Buddy! Those writers! Drama! Well done, darling, well done! Only a week left till Cannes and we're twenty girls short. What the fuck are you doing? Why do I have to take care of everything? I took one weekend off... To fuck around with your lover boy! That's right. To have fun with my lover boy. Can't you handle a single thing? Let it go, Emi. Emi what? Are we going to yell in a trio or you let me say something? The whole fucking Cannes happens thanks to the thing that I started. What I started! Kiddo! No matter what you do, you'll remain a fucking Thunderbird in a Moët bottle. The Saudis don't even want you there. What? They don't want us to go there? Santino said that only I should go this time. Since when do you know it? Since Dorota talked to Santino in Courchevel and broke his rules. It mattered so much to me. I even bought a swimsuit. Marianka, it's not up to me, you know that. Let it be, she doesn't give a damn. That's what you call loyalty. That's how she pays us back for taking care of her, bringing her up. You call that upbringing? The guide how to suck cock and get more dough? Did I stay here for free? No, it was you both who lived off me! Get the fuck out of my house. Get the fuck out! NOW! Kamila? But I'll go to Cannes? Marianka... are you going with us? No shit. We've got money. We've got fame. We'll make it without that bitch. Wow! I'm doubly blessed. Thanks that you went for it. We have a romantic dinner and meeting my parents behind us. Moving in together, ticked off. We even have a child, quite grown up. There's only a wedding left. It's only about the wedding night? But of course. If there's no other way to get you to bed, then... You understand. Don't mind me, mum and dad. I think I've got one. She knows the trade. Not bad, isn't she? Who is she? She commented on all pics from Courchevel. As if she badly wanted to be there. EMI Who else commented on them? Wait a second... Let me check. What... about that one? She's some famous TV host. That's fresh meat. - You want meat? - No... Thanks. I wonder what she digs. She looks as if she smoked the pole since birth. I've seen that dancer in a TV show too. What does it mean to smoke a pole? Dance polka. Because this dance is smokin' fast. All right, go back to work. Hi, there! Hello! Gosh, I know you, you're that singer! Me? No! I love your songs! Autograph, please! It's not me. 40... Glad you're here! Forty-one... Excuse me, what's your name? Whatever you want it to be, sweetheart. Silly! When Sam finds out, you're done. Okay! 43. Angela 44... 45... Good morning! 46, 47, 48... Hi! 49. You look gorgeous! One more person. Only those checked in. Damn, one's missing. - Excuse me! - Yes? I've got one funny question. Will you suck cock for ten thousand? Excuse me?! Euros. EMI Girls, don't go to Cannes alone or without our host's consent. If our host asks you to do something, obey. When it comes to his guests, it's up to you to decide. Please stay reasonable, yet sexy. Sure thing! Like ladies! Have fun like a lady... ...fuck hard like a slut! So, finally we meet again. Are you happy? I don't know yet. I'm very happy. Come, I have a nice surprise for you. Oh, I hate surprises. I'm so bored! Don't complain, you get paid for it. Am I complaining? But it's still boring. Why don't we'll lick our pussies? I'd give head every one of them for free. Fucking chastity! Emi. So, girls. I need a... yes, the two of you, you. The two of you. And the two of you. Nice and ready in 30 minutes on the deck. - In 30 minutes? - Yes. But in 30 minutes we will just be arriving at the hotel. I don't care, it's not my problem. I told you to be ready. Everywhere and anywhere. 20,000 Euros. Go to a shop. Nice and ready in 30 minutes on the deck. Have fun. Let's go shopping girls! Have you ever thought about becoming a royal pimp? What do you mean? Santino's father is very sick. Does that mean that? Santino will become the king? I don't know that yet, okay? Okay. But I know that next week, Santino, his uncle, the father of Carlito and Bahir and some other important people are coming. I think, to announce the successor. So, you and me and the best chicks in the world and the best pay ever. Yes. We are going to be extremely rich. I love it. If everything goes smoothly, I will take you to Milan. And I will show you how beautiful it is. I will introduce you to my family. - To your family? - Yeah. Oh, sorry. I have to answer this. Sooner or later, I will throw that phone in the ocean. It's business. You got someone? No, come on, I told you I am not fit for relationships. You got someone or not? Come on. So, I can invite him to dinner tomorrow. You can try. Who's that? That is Mr. X. And that is all you need to know. Is he a king or something? Better. What about Santino? Don't worry. He will show up. Girls. Now dance. But how? There's no music. Any fool would dance to music. And you're not so foolish, are you? Come on girls, dance! Oh come on. More lively. Ya Allah, more lively. No, sexy no. So how? Make it funny. Emi, what does he mean? You heard them: act funny. Not a big deal, is it? Unless you want to smoke his pole. The first one who makes Mr. X laugh will get a tip. Okay. What the fuck? Have you lost it? Oh, fuck! Are you okay? You wanted to hit me, bitch? KAMILA Stop it. Fuck you! Wanna fight, bitch? Stop it! Keep the fuck out! Are you fucking crazy? That's cool! Throw it! Give it back! Give it back! We have a winner. I want to go home. I didn't sign up for stripping for Arabs. You suddenly became a saint? You thought I'll pay you 300 Euros a day for sunbathing? Nobody mentioned fucking with fat guys. Only fun and culture. You fucked no one so far. I'm sure when it's time, you do it the right way. I was supposed to be a hostess. This is something else. You're an actress. It can be the role of your life. You'll handle that! I don't do porn. Flashing your pussy on stage is all right? On stage it's noble art. I want to go home. Fine. Forget the dough. Know what? Don't give a damn. Mhm. You won't believe it! You know how much it is? Fifty thousand dollars! Ten for me. Well done! Sure, mummy. So, Asia? Are you sure? Hello? BARTEK Hi. Do you like surprises? It depends, of what kind. BARTEK You'll love that one. Listen, darling, I'll call you later. I'm working. Bye. Wow, I underestimated you. Shall I change? You're not that bad. You always have an answer, don't you? Of course, I'm Polish. Come, I'll buy you shoes on the way. Surprise! I could hardly wait to do it. Sam, I'm sorry, this is... Hello buddy, I'm Bartek. And Sam is... Her boss. Don't be late. I'm leaving in two days. Have a nice evening. Thank you. Bartek, I'm at work! I know, I'm sorry, I missed you so much. I thought you'd be working and I'll just wait for your sign. The phone! Mm hmm. Wait, wait. Pick it up, it might be important. Bartek, I need to get back to work. You cannot stay here, I'm sorry. All right, I can afford another hotel. We'll meet when I'm done! - Emi! - Mm hmm. Do you like Vodka? Yes. You one down and only... Wanna bet? Yes. With a Polish girl? You deserve this. Oh. Thank you. Good Polish. Now tell to your girls, to take off their panties. What? You have no imagination? Stop with that bullshit. They must take them off. Come on, it's just a game. EMI Girls! Take off your panties. What? Take off your panties. All right, panties off, cash on the table. The blondie as well. Come on, Malina! What's wrong? I can't do it. I'm ashamed. You didn't tell it's gonna be like that. Stop pretending. You wanted to come here. It's not about that... What is it? I have a postnatal scar and I didn't shave. Wow, you are good. I know. But this should be your job. Do you have any idea of how hard it is to get all these girls ready? Yeah, must have been very hard. You stop sucking that cock, right? Don't be a pig. A pig? Fuck you Emi. Fuck you! Sam, what is this all about? I have been extremely tolerant with you. And you fucking don't appreciate it. That's my problem. I'll show you. Come. You come here. Come here. Smell this shit. Smell it. She smoke. Get the fuck out of here. The rules are simple. No cigarettes. No party. And no fucking outside of the employers. You think the rules don't apply to you? You're fucking wrong. Look at this, huh? Hey, you think I'm stupid? What the fuck is this? You think I'm stupid? - You think, I'm stupid? - Let her go. - Get the fuck out of my party! - Emi, I can't swim. Emi, please! He will drown me, Emi! Stop it! Get the fuck out of my party. We had an agreement. And you deceive me. I needed someone to help me. You get me. I need 20 new girls before we leave to Ibiza. It's impossible. If you cannot do it. I'll find somebody else who can. If you send us home, I'll tell everyone you told us to gang bang with guys. What? You heard me. I didn't tell you to fuck anyone. Whom they gonna believe? You? Or a kidnapped 16-year-old? You told me you were an adult! Don't I look eighteen? Emi! Look what they fucking gave me! What is this? I'll throw it into trash. Or a museum. Sell it. It's probably worth more than a Lamborghini. GIRL #8 My laptop is gone! Fuck, we got robbed! Money, wallet, all's gone! My backpack is gone! What the fuck? Backpack is gone! That funny one with the cat? Fuck, I kept all the money there! I can't believe it. They even took the fucking suitcases. You really kept it in the backpack? Where should I've kept it? In my panties? Easy come. Easy go. You have to get out of here. Somebody from the hotel called the police. But why? It was us who got robbed. Oh, really? And what are you gonna say, huh? That you've lost $50,000 in cash? And how do you get it? Pack your fucking things. We have nowhere to go. She can stay in the other hotel with the other girls. You can come and stay in the yacht. Move! Come. Listen, I won't manage to get new girls tomorrow. Okay. And after all of this. Never mind that now, okay? They can stay. But they must give 100% on the party, but this one. This one cannot stay. Santino will recognize 100%. Go. But why? Santino really likes her. Don't you fucking understand? Santino cannot fall in love with European whore. That's why they pay me for. Okay, I understand, but... Police! Let's crouch. Sam, is everything okay between us? Between us? I don't know what's between us. Will they give us the money back? Are you crazy? Who? I don't know. The police? Maybe they'll find it at the hotel. Can't you see? Hotel staff could've robbed us. Santino would give it back for sure. I must see him! Wake up finally! You'll never get on that yacht again. Emi, please, don't leave me. You sail away tomorrow. I'm broke. Haven't I told you not to come? You insisted on it like dumb cunt. I let you do it like another dumb cunt. Mother told me: Tender hearts must be badass. I want to go home then. Give me my passport back. Are you five years old, bitch? You have one week to find clients and make up for what we lost. Including my share, got it? Dorota? Guess who just let me out in the cold. I'm not sure if you know it, but there are no rules out there at sea. Allah does not see what happens there. That's why dark desires and wildest cravings are fulfilled here. EMI Santino finally arrived. He flew in with his uncle who was to announce the successor. And I counted earned dollars in my mind. Are you from Dorota? Take off your panties, and rub yourself against my shoes. Okay. You feel how warm they are? Human skin. I love your shoes. I want them too. No way. They are from a Russian shop. Special shop for special customers only. Oh, you mean initiated customers. Yeah. I can pay. Are you special? What's wrong? Emi, I can't do it! But why? I never... I can't do it. I'm sorry! I'm a virgin. I can't do it. You're a virgin? Girl, you'll earn even more! Justyna did hymen reconstruction already twice. It's period if they ask you! What are you doing? They'll never touch an unclean girl. Come on, go there. Let me finally act! You behave like a child! Time to grow up! I've heard about your islands. I'm sorry, I have to take her, but I will bring you another girl in a second, okay? What's the problem? She speaks only, because I am 16. I don't mind. - Sit with us, Cinderella. - Yeah. Why do you have to be such a bitch at every party? Take you hands. Don't talk to your host like this. Be nice. How much do you want for suck my dick? There is not enough money in the world. I gave you a change to earn something. - Bahir. - Sit down! Sit down! The party's over, Bahir! My cousin, doesn't know how to control himself. We're going back to Cannes. I mean, I am very sorry about what happened, okay? You're safe here. Nobody would come. Maybe, I should leave you alone. Sam. Yes. I owe you a kiss. Is this private or professional? You know. When I was a kid I was playing, with some friends in a courtyard. We were... we were building a tree house, you know tree house? We were so much happy out there. That we completely forgot that down, it was very late. So, I decided to took my clock backwards. To justify, to have an excuse cause I though my mother would have been very angry at me. When I got home she wasn't there anymore. I don't understand. Me neither. EMI This is Emi. Can't talk right now. Don't leave a message. Because in the end... it's not about who you are. It's about the choice you make. What's wrong? Nothing. Okay, I'll call you later. How much you've got? Six hundred. How much? Six hundred! What are you gonna do with it? I don't know where to hide it. Take it, but don't lose it! Alright! Emi! I'm sorry, I acted like an idiot. I love you! I got you in trouble. Forgive me. These are for you, come. You did this for me? I must tell you something. Me too. Wait, it's important. I know everything. And I understand. You know? And you know it too. But you don't know who I am. I know. You are me; I am you. Will you fly to the moon with me? I always wanted to fly there. Wait. The death of Kamila B. whose body was found near Cannes six months ago remains a mystery. Hey. EMI All your life you try to find out what you really want. Yet you end up sticking to one path. Only when you get derailed from it, you spot other paths that were there all the time. You begin to look at the same world differently. And the person you once were becomes a perfect stranger. Years passed, I began to forget who I had been. But I never stopped looking over my shoulder. Good morning! Can I help you? Who was that? I don't know. I was afraid it was a debt collector. What debt collector? Honey, you can't blame yourself for the recession. And I had been poor before. I can take care of it all. What are you doing? What? Are you crazy? You have a one-track mind? Mummy! Hi! I have a horse. It's beautiful. EMI Who gave it to you? That man. Here she is. My beautiful wife Emi. Let me introduce you. This is Dan Hooker. My pleasure. - Dan Hooker? - Yes. Your husband does not exaggerate about your beauty. So, it's true, what they say about Polish horses and women. Oh, you know the saying. It's Arabic, isn't it? Huh, I don't know why, but I still have this over overwhelming impression that we've already met before. You want to show me the horses? Yes of course, let's go. Please. Ladies first. Your daughter is very beautiful. Hey name is Kamila, right? How old is she? That's none of your business. What the fuck are you doing here? I'm buying a horse. And possibly the most beautiful horse in the entire stable. For a million bucks? Let's consider that delayed payment for your... outstanding performance in Cannes. And what do you really want? Ah, Emi, Emi, Emi. You haven't changed a bit. But right as always. We are organizing a huge party in Dubai And the Prince would love to have you back to work. You know you broke my heart. And you robbed me. That was a small punishment because you disobeyed my order. I mean look at you. You don't have to play games with me. This is not your life. This is not who you really are. It's not about who we are. It's about the choices we make. And she found the prince? She didn't know how a prince looks like. So, she danced with every man on the ball. She danced and danced and got so tired that she decided to make her own ball. I love you. I love you too! - Bye. - Bye. TEACHER Slowly children! DOROTA Hello, darling! You have a beautiful daughter. We want to talk business. We know that Sam made you an offer. It's yours if you want it. We'd love to, but he won't talk to us. Emi, do it for the old times' sake. You don't have to do anything. We will find all the girls. Come on, the recession hit us. You didn't put aside anything? You know, girls like us give away two things easily: head and money. Excuse me. Great to see you, but you don't step into the same river twice. Hello fatso! You'll get your lunch soon. Now, we know what you really do for living, Emilia. I won't let you destroy my family. I concerns me and Bartek. Where are they? I thought he bet on the wrong horse from the very start. You know nothing. I love him. Only champions fit into our family. And you're only suitable for a ride. You're not welcomed at our home anymore. I'm sorry, your husband took Kamilka a few hours ago. A few hours ago? Good bye. You can get out now. Hush. Hush. EMI I beg you Bartek. You know that I love you both. Don't do it to us, please! I tried to tell you so many times. You always changed the subject and never listened to me. Fuck no! Talk to me, you coward! EMI I have arranged everything with Sam. And I have a plan. I'll use the money that I'll earn to start all over again. I'll take Kamilka from Bartek and move to Canada. So, girls to you and the Dubai girls who will help me get my daughter back. Emi, don't forget that the world never forgives hookers. We have to forgive ourselves. Who else than us, the super hookers? Come on girls, one last time. Leave. Leave! - Sam? - Sam do his part. From now on you arrange everything with me. Santino. Santino is with his father. Does this look familiar? And this? Do you remember this? Do you know what shame followed me by my family? Because I was mutilated by one of Santino's sluts. I did what I... Don't speak until I give you permission. This is my new rule now. This... no. That... no. Santino was too weak. His principals were fake. He was like one of his sluts. He made friendship with them. Gossip. Watching movies. Cooking. Shopping. But will he be the king? Nope. No. You see, Emi. You inspire me a lot. And when I attacked you. You fought back. You won. So I was asking myself, "Why am I not fighting back?" Then I took the fight. Now, I am the prince. We're leaving. We have to leave now! Take it easy! Have you ever seen a burger covered with 32 carat gold? We must go! Get a grip! You always have issues! Let's take the girls. Santino is dead, Bahir's in charge. I know. What? I knew you wouldn't come, so Sam bought your sex tape from Dimitri. He covered all expenses. On top of that! You should have accepted Sam's initial offer. Now... Party! If you still can. Exactly! Have fun like a lady! Fuck hard like a slut! Emi. Sam. Found your shoe, Cinderella. Feel it, huh? Your tight ass. Now, you are gonna feel something strong bitch! You are not Cinderella anymore. Now, it's your turn. EMI How much can you bear for love? How much can you endure? Nobody has ever loved me for who I was. And I loved somebody very much. Freeze! Police! Hands off me! Hand! Now! Get off me! Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Good morning! Can I help you? It was Emi's idea from the start. She robbed me to set up this business. I expected a concert, ma'am. Something like a hostess... or else. Nobody mentioned sex initially. If I had known, I'd never have agreed. I consented to nothing. Only when we arrived in Cannes. It turned out, what she really planned. Instead of normal partying, she told us to fuck with old Arabs. I gave head, although reluctantly. I sunbathed. I love sunbathing! I wasn't allowed to smoke. And I'm addicted. There was nothing instead. Big fucking nothing. I got a certain sum of money. I took no money. I was there to earn money. I wasn't getting money for it. Emi was. She took 50%. Musicians in Poland earn peanuts nowadays. Since we already talk about it, I'd like to say that Emi took 70% of our tips. Emi destroyed my life. She simply destroyed my life. Those parties were sick! I'd rather not go into details. Unless it's necessary. I thought I had a great time. You know that I had my crotch stitched after Cannes? Could I have some water please? I attended therapy. Took sleeping pills, antidepressants. Nothing helped. Nothing helps. And it's not that I can live a normal life now. Yes, I attempted suicide. Twice. She's responsible for Kamila's death. She was such a sweet girl. She turned her into a whore. And then left broke. Marianka will tell you. Marianka will tell it's her fault. It's Emi's fault! It's not her fault. Why aren't all those men here? Married politicians, sportsmen, stars, priests, Arabs? They pay us, do what they want and are still treated like saints. When we're gone the trade transfers to the net. You'll never stop this, men are allowed to do everything. Aren't they? I wanted to save the girls from poverty and hopelessness. I wanted to help, I'm not a monster. That's why you told them to whore? Excuse me, excuse me, ma'am. Do you have a father? No, ma'am, I don't. I was raised in an orphanage. Do you like gangster movies? I do, what's the point? Everybody loves them. Even though they kill, rape and torture. People still love them. We are hated. Will there ever be a movie about us? I doubt it. Excuse yourself anyway you want. You won't change the facts. You have daughter, right? Would you like her, someday, to meet someone like you? Mummy! Emi! Mum, I'm so sorry. Forgive me, please. You should forgive me. I've never been a good mother. Mummy! I wanted... I would have changed many things. We'll change it mum! I'll get out soon. I love you more than ever before now. Hello? Mum? Hello. Excuse me, I can't hear a thing! I can't hear you mum! I love you the way you are Emi. Mum, I love you too! Just the way you are! I love you just the way you are! EMI I've been telling myself not to regret anything all my life. Therefore, today... I regret everything. I regret not being with my mother when she was dying. I regret not picking up that call from my friend. I regret not telling Sam that Kamila is his daughter. I regret not finishing telling my baby the tale during our last night together. I would have told her that neither prince, nor the palace made the princess happy. That it was too late for her to find out, what could really make her happy. You're two fifty short. I only have one zloty. Can I ask you a question? What's your price?
