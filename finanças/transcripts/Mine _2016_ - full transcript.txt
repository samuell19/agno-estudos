Fixed & Synced by bozxphd. Okay, I just got us a new friend. Targets, two o'clock. Range, 1,708 meters. Wind, from three o'clock, six miles per dial wind right 2.3 mils. Now, Mike, I know you're good. No, I mean you're real good. Right? But you are not that good. We're not here to play games, man. So what are we here for then? Huh? I know what you're thinking. We're here to complete our mission, Tommy. I mean, come on, dude. What's your point, Tommy? All right, look, my point is... my point is... We've been here for what... What is it now? Two months? Three months and six days. My man, that is my point. That is my point exactly. Three months and six days since you last seen Jenny. Oh, Jenny... Jenny, I love you. Jenny, I want to kiss you. Oh, Jenny, what you need? Kiss me. - Contact. - What? Shit. Here we go. Hogsden, Hogsden, Alpha-Margot 4, Elvis is in the building, over. Here, Hogsden. The target should be aboard a black Land Cruiser with guards. Do you confirm the target's presence, over? They said black. It's gray. It's a different vehicle. It's still a Land Cruiser, Mike. Something's happening. It looks they're about to... perform some kind of ceremony. Land Cruiser approaching. The designated target is Said Assiff, 65. Confirm, over. Target, Ten o'clock. Range, 977 meters. Copy, 9-7-7. Indexed. He could have grown a beard since he was photographed. It could be him. Target confirmed. Send it. It's a wedding. So what? Say again, over. So what? Proceed and confirm your zero. Over. Send it. Send it. Alpha-Margot-4, confirm hit. Over. I don't have a good shot. Hogsden, the groom's in the way of the target. Awaiting your orders, sir, over. Mike, no. Mike, man, don't get any funny ideas, right? This is what we're here for. Neutralize the target, over. Mike, get yourself out of this spiritual crisis and just shoot the damn guy. Alpha-Margot 4 to Hogsden, it's a wedding. You're asking me to shoot the father of the groom and the groom. Please confirm, over. Alpha-Margot 4, it took us 30 months to locate the target, Said Assiff. As far as we know, Assiff doesn't have any son, but he could be part of the same terrorist cell. Don't wait for a clear shot. Neutralize and confirm, over. You see, Mike, man, even terrorists get married. We don't even know if that is Said Assiff. He got out of a different colored car and at this distance, you know you can't make a positive I.D. Send it, Mike. Send the God-damned shot, Mike. Confirm, over. Take the God-damn shot, Mike! Hogsden, target's moving. I lost 'em. - Alpha-Margot 4, out. - Damn it, Mike! Alpha-Margot 4, mission aborted. Request extract. Get us out of here, over. Give us your new position, Alpha-Margot, over. Negative, GPS broken, over. Roger, wait for new orders. We're looking for a new p... - What are you doing? - Something. Mayday, Mayday, Alpha-Margot 4 requests immediate extract. The sandstorm is increasing in force, over. The new extract location is a village six klicks west. How copy? Over. Negative. Do not copy! Village is 15 klicks west from here? Over! Well, that's great, Mike. Five hours on foot. That's west. -I know which way is west, Mike. You know what day it is? It's Tuesday. It's not just any Tuesday, Mike. This is the second Tuesday of the month, which means my son is expecting my call. I know. I haven't let him down yet. What do you guys talk about anyway? What is he? Four? Actually, Mike, he's decided that he's, um... He's gonna be a vegetarian. The other day Anne was in the house and she was, like, cleaning up. She looks into the backyard and there's Jake running around, running around... She's like, "Jake! Jake, what are you doing?" And, uh, he turns around. He's eating a leaf and he goes, "My name isn't Jake." "I'm a Brontosaurus! Rawr!" Oh, man, that guy's nuts. I know it's probably all bullshit, but, you know, it just makes me feel better. It's crazy, right? You know, Mike, I used to think that our marriage was this big, big, big, big mistake... You know, a curse. Then Jake comes along and he changes everything, you know. We used to fight all the time. We still do fight all the time, but now we got this little man who makes us think twice about what we're saying. Whereas before, we'd just fly off the handles, just say stupid things, not speak to each other for days, but then Jake, you know, set us straight. Hey, I know that face. What are you thinking, my man? What's on your mind, huh? Is there something you want to tell me? Come on, Mike, you can't just keep this inside. Whatever it is, you got to let it out. It's much better just to get it out into the ether. Are you thinking of proposing to Jenny? Is that what it is? - It's, uh... - What? It's... It's complicated. It's a big step. It's complicated, right. That is one... small step... for mankind... but that is one giant leap... for a man. Aww, man. You know, you really are a mess, man, you know that? What is with you? Here Hogsden. We don't detect active guerrilla troops in your area, Alpha-Margot, but once they get their boss back to safety, those guys might come back looking for you. The new extract location is far enough from their hideout and from sandstorms. We can't make the Halos fly there and ground vehicles were not requested for this mission. You have to cross the desert. The dunes keep shifting their position and the radio signal won't always get through. Hang on, marines. I can't see anything through this sand. I think I see something moving. Could be locals. What are they doing? It looks like... they're digging... in the sand. Hey, if those were Berbers, that means we're heading in the right direction. Well, unless they were just a refraction. Huh. Look, I know it's dramatic, but it's just an old Berber trick. They use these signs to keep enemies away from their villages. It just means that we are almost there, bro'. The village is probably... right over that dune, over there. Come on, let's go. Hey? In the last 40 years, there's been 8,000 declared conflicts. There's 33 million land mines buried in this area. Land mines? Oh, I like it when you get optimistic, Mike. Okay, now you listen, Mr. Wikipedia, you can find all kinds of stuff in the desert. Look at the condition that sign is in. Okay, who knows where this is from or what it really says? Mike, don't get paranoid. Don't let that thing mess with you head. I'm just reviewing our options. We do have two options because we're such lucky guys. Now, we can turn around and we can die of thirst or we can get to that village within the hour, Mike. I know which option I'm taking. You know what? I don't even like water. Water's overrated, got no taste. An ice... ice cold slushy, oh, man... that'd be so good. You know, usually I do a Root Beer, but I think this time, I'm gonna go for a strawberry. Hm-hmm. Thanks, man. Ho! Oh, okay. Hmm, okay, Mike. You know what? You forget what I said about water. Hmm! A couple of drops really gets you going. Don't it? Whoop. Come on, Mikey. Come on. Now, come on, Mike. Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Come on, Mike. Hey, you got to stop thinking about that sign. You're over-thinking this thing, man, I mean, which doesn't surprise me, you know, seeing as you are you. And, like, you're gonna have to explain something to me. Now, why is it that a psychopath such as yourself... who ain't afraid to duke it out with... How many was it? I think it was four... No five... of the biggest army rangers I have ever seen. And yet you piss your pants at the thought of a sign that's been blowing around the desert for God knows how long. I've just had a premonition. I think there's a slushy machine back at that village. - Who knows? Maybe... - Tom... Tommy! Tommy! Listen to me, man, you got to calm down, all right? Damn it, you've got to calm down! Oh why... -Mayday! Mayday! This is Alpha-Marg... Oh, Mike, it hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! Tommy, listen to me, man. I can't move, okay? I stepped on one of 'em too, all right? Oh my God! Oh my God! Mike! Tommy, you got to calm down, okay? We gotta get to the village. If you keep going on like this, we'll never get there! You hate the village. It's okay. We're gonna get there, okay? You got to check your radio. - Yeah! - Come on, you can do it! Okay, I can do it, I can... Mike, I can do it. - Come on, there you go. - I can do it, okay, I can... I can see my pack. There you go, Marine, come on! Come on! No more, Mike! -You got to check the radio, man! I can't move. I can't move! You can do this! Come on! Just grab your medical kit. It's in your top middle pocket. - What? What? - Come on, man, grab your kit. Okay, okay. - Come on, Marine, move! - Okay, okay! There you go. Grab your medical kit. - Yeah, yeah. - Good work, Marine! Here you go, good work. Good work. I got 'em. I got 'em. I got 'em. I got 'em. -There you go. No, no, Tommy, you need... Come on, man, you need that morphine. Let's go, Marine, come on! Focus! Focus! You endure this pain. You remember what you learned in training! We got to get to that village! And you... you got to call Jake, man. - What? Jake? - That's right. - Jake... he's waiting for me... - It's Tuesday, man. - Yeah, Mhmm. - That's right, Marine! Now move! - Oh, Mike! - No, don't look at it, Tommy. - No, Mike, I've got no legs. - No, Tommy, don't look at it. I got no legs... -Come on, man, don't look at it! - Ahh! - Don't look at it! No, Mike, I haven't got any legs! Mike, I haven't got any legs! There you go. It's right by your side. There you go. There you go. Yeah. Now can you reach your pack? We need that radio. Wait, no, Tommy, one is more than enough, man. No, Tommy! Wait... No, no, Tommy, one is enough! Okay. Okay. All right, I need you to listen to me, Tommy. You have to reach your pack! - You have to check the radio, okay? - Okay. Can you reach it? There you go. Grab your pack. - There you go. - I got it. Good work! -I got it, I got it, I got it. Good work! - Good work! - Yeah. - I got it, I got it. - You got it. I got it. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Good work, man, you're gonna be fine. Alpha-Margot 4. - Man down, man down. - Tommy, I'm not copying you. Man, I'm not hearing you in my com. You got to make sure the radio's on. I need a phone to call Jake. I need a phone to call my... my... my son. Tommy, I'm not hearing you on my coms. You got to... You got to check the walkie, - make sure it's on. - I want a Root Beer! All right. - Stay with me, man. - Why did I want a strawberry? - Mike, what was I thinking? - Stay with me, Tommy! Mike, the village. I need to get to the village. - It's gonna be beautiful, Mike. - Okay. - It's gonna be so beautiful. - You're gonna be fine, man. I'll be right there. This old mine, it's probably rusty and dead anyway. - I'll be right there. - Oh, no. Oh, no! - Don't you even think about it, Mike! - I have to do something. - No, don't you even think about it, Mike! - You're losing too much blood! I'm not gonna let you die like this! Tommy, no. All right, Mike, will you tell Jake that I love him? No, Tommy, no. - You stay alive, man. - Tommy, no! Ah, shit. Ah, ah, ah. Whoo, whoo. Ah. Batteries. Mayday, mayday, Alpha-Margot 4 to Hogsden. Do you copy? Over. Mayday, mayday, Alpha-Margot 4 to Hogsden. Do you copy? Over. Base camp here. We've been looking for you for hours, Alpha-Margot, over. Copy you, Hogsden. Sir, my partner was killed in action and I am in critical condition requesting immediate extract with E.O.D., over. Define critical, staff sergeant, over. I stepped on an explosive ordinance, sir. It's the same kind that killed my spotter, over. Major? Over. What about your mission, sergeant? Over. I failed, sir, but I'm requesting support. Sir, I am requesting immediate support, over. What is your position, Alpha-Margot? Over. I can't say for sure. GPS is kaput. We're about four hours due east of mission location. Roger. Still two hours from the village, over. I don't think you understand my situation. I'm stuck with my left foot on a damn land mine. - Over. - Affirmative, Alpha-Margot, your situation is clear, over. That's great. My situation's clear. Then come and get me, over. Negative, the Halos are still all grounded because of the sandstorms, over. Shit. Okay. So what's the plan? Over. There's a convoy pinned down by fire from a group of guerrillas just over the border. If everything goes well, they should be passing by your current location in about 52 hours, Sergeant. Over. Sir, with all due respect, if everything goes well, I don't know if I can survive for 52 hours like this. Over. Get ready to signal your position when the time comes. We'll try to contact you via radio to make sure you're... still there. Over. So that's it? What about all that "No man left behind" business? Over. Listen, Sergeant Stevens, as far as we know, the type of land mines scattered in that area can remain active for up to 40 years, but 10 years after they're produced, depending on certain variables, there's a four percent chance of their malfunctioning. Fifteen years after production, malfunction levels reach as high as seven percent. Great. Given the scenario, my personal advice, should you not be able to resist for long in the desert for any reason, is to try the Shuman maneuver. The Shuman maneuver, Major? Over. It is a last resort. Digging a small trench to take cover from the explosion. If you make the sole of your boot stick to the ground, - and raise your feet sideways... - Major? Major? Over. The damages caused by the shock waves would be limited to non-vital limb loss... Shuman maneuver, my ass. Perfect. What's next, huh? Sorry, Tom. I got to get those batteries. Thanks, man. No water. No radio. It's the end of the line for you, Mike. Help! Hey! Help! Okay. Oh, come on, Mike. Stop, show me your hands. Don't take another step! Do you understand me? No, no, no, no. Don't move. Don't move. This is a... mine field... full of mines! Boom! Pshtt! Pshtt! You think this is funny? Did you put these mines here? Is that why you think this is funny? Look, man, I'm begging you. I can't stay stuck here forever. Why you stuck? Oh, thank God. Okay, you understand. All right, look, I need water and my radio. Is your village on the other side of that dune? Water! Radio! Why you stay here? No go home and-and family? Are you kidding? It... My left foot is on top of a mine. If I move it... Pshtt. Got it? - This why? - Yes! This why! You're sure? Do you see this body? This is Thomas Madison, my best friend, and he's dead now because he also stepped on one of your mines! Mine not mine. Don't worry about friend. He find his peace now, but you alive. You must take next step now. No, next... My next step will be my last. Got it? Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Now, while you're here, please grab my radio. My radio... the radio... Look, it's... it's right there in the pack. Just grab the radio. Please. Radio no good. No music now. No dancing. No, you don't understand. I need it to call... You need to make next step. Wait. Where you going? And why are you walking like that? Do you know where the mines are? Because I'm standing on one! I'm on a mine so there's no next step for me! You got it, asshole? You need to keep moving on. What an idiot. Oh, come on, marine. It's a simple job. This has got to be better than nothing. Wait. Be careful. Be careful. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. Would you tell your dad I said thank you... very, very much and that I've very, very grateful. What's that you got there? It's... a toy soldier. Look at this. I got one too. Is this yours? Yeah. He's stuck. Can't move. While you're here, would you mind going and getting me that radio? Right there in the pack... Would you grab that for me, please? Please go get the radio. It's right there. Come on, you got to at least look where I am pointing. Go get the radio! The radio! No, wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait, no, I... I wasn't yelling at you. I was... I was just trying to get the radio. ♪ Nobody's fault but mine ♪ ♪ Nobody's fault but mine ♪ ♪ If I die and my soul be lost ♪ ♪ Nobody's fault but mine ♪ ♪ I said I had a mother who could pray ♪ ♪ I had a mother who could pray ♪ ♪ If I find... ♪ Your Highness. This secret message will serve as your amulet, protecting you from all evil, my knight. Don't torture yourself, okay? I know you have to do this. So you go and you... defeat your demons like a knight in shining armor. True of heart and strong of armor. I know everything's gonna be all right. I... I know it is... but don't take too long. You go win this war and come back to me. Otherwise, I might just find myself another bad boy... Like a Delta Force guy or... Or a ranger. I love you. You very lucky man. Here we go again. Look, man, I'm not in the mood for your bullshit. I didn't sleep that well last night. What your name? Mike. Mike! Mike in your language is Man-No-Take-Next-Step. No. Mike is Michael. What would that mean to a Berber? Mike is Michael. Hmm. You say me "Berber." You know what means Berber? I do. It's a guy who won't bring you his radio if he asks you for it. And I bet your daughter had to bring me that canteen without telling you last night, huh? In my language, Berber is free man. Why you no free man? Okay. Okay. You foot on mine. Ha! - Finally. - But you very lucky man. Huh? You. Foot on mine and mine no explode. Night in desert and animal no eat you. You very lucky man, Mike is Michael. Okay, great. Thank you. Now, can we just... Mike is Michael... why you put foot on mine, huh? Obviously, I didn't know there was a mine here when I put my foot on it. I don't know where the mines are, like you do. You are wrong, Mike is Michael. We don't know where the mines are. I see you guys walking around here all zig-zaggy. You know the right path. I don't know where the mines are. If I walk straight on mine field, now or later, I step on mine, sure. I know your problem, Mike is Michael. Hmm. - You afraid. - Yeah. No shit. Tell me about it. No, no, no understand. Where we are now no matter. Only matter where we want to go, huh? I only want to go home, eh? To... to family. I only follow my destiny. Well, it looks like my destiny stops here. I took my last false step. Every day, huh? Every day your step can be your last step. What difference today? The difference is that today... I know. And even if I was a lucky man, I only have a seven percent chance of not dying. Seven percent, good. Huh? Look... this has been delightfully philosophical and all that... but would you mind... handing me... that radio? Thank you. Hello? No, no, he's busy. Hey... Why you put foot on mine? Because we were on our way to the village. Why reach village? Because we were lost in the desert. Why in desert? -Because that was our mission. - Why mission? - Because we're at war. Why you fight war? Huh? You want to kill enemy? I'm a soldier. And why you a soldier? Because... I had no reason to stay. I had no one any more. Why no one any more? Hey. You still want radio? Ah. Mayday, mayday... Become free man. You have to move on. Even wrong path can take you home. I'll never make it. Stay alive, man. Shh. Shh, no, it's okay. It's gonna be okay. Shut up. Shut up. What else was I supposed to do? Where were you when she was sick? Why don't you just leave me alone? So what? You just... You want to disappear for years to God knows where and then you want to come and have a talk? Great. Let's talk. We're here. A perfect opportunity. What do you got? Huh? Don't you dare bring her up. Don't you even say her name. What are you so mad at, my friend? Tommy? Whoa, you're a real mess, man. Let's get a move-on, soldier. We're going home. Or do you think that Jen is gonna wait for you forever? But you were my friend. I'm not going anywhere. Mayday, ma... Mayday. Mayday... mayday. No use. Convoy's coming. They'll call us when the signal improves. There's no use us keep calling them because we're just gonna kill the battery. Right? - Right. - Right. Oh, Mike, come on. Stop it, Mike, please. This is just your imagination. There is no way your cell phone is ringing out here in the middle of the desert. Look... There's no way this could be happening. You know that, right? You don't know shit about this, Tom! You know what? That's true. You never had the balls to say a single word to me about what was eating you up inside. I'm sorry, Tommy. He left you when you needed him most. It's just what I did to Jenny. It's not the same thing. I'm just like him. No, you're not. Because you are gonna go back to Jenny. Because Jenny loves you for who you are. She's waiting for you. That's the reason you need to stay alive. Watch out. I don't have enough ammo to kill 'em all. You're right. We're gonna have to try the maneuver. What maneuver? -The maneuver... the damn Shuman maneuver. Oh, you got to be kidding. That'll never work. If all the dogs attack you at once, they're gonna knock you over and that mine's gonna explode. Now, hurry up. We got no time. That's it. Now, you pin your sole to that ground... it should work. The mine sensor won't immediately register the change of pressure. You ever hear about this working in real life? Good! At least we gained yourself a couple 10ths of a second. You might not get out of this unscathed, but you will get out of it. Now, marine... dig! - This is bullshit! - Come on! That's it! Don't stop. Come on! Don't stop! Keep on digging! Dig, Marine, dig! Come on! Mike! Mike! Do it! Do it... now! Your Highness. I hereby swear... to be a courageous knight... reverent and courteous... a champion of truth and justice. I hereby swear to be honest and good. I swear... to protect our realm. I swear these things... before you... my princess. Can I get that beer now? Please? Alpha-Margot 4, Alpha-Margot 4. This is Hogsden. How copy? Over. Hogsden, this is... Alpha-M... Alpha-Mar... It's me. It's Mike. I hear you. Roger, Alpha-Margot-4, your extract convoy is en-route. Echo Bravo 3 is headed in your direction, Sergeant. The convoy is taking... Echo Bravo 3 has been bogged down in a firefight. It's behind schedule. The new ETA of extract is now 17 hours. How copy... You have to hold on at least another 17 hours, Sergeant. Can you do that? Over. No. I can't. Sergeant Stevens... I have someone here you'd like to speak to, I believe. Considering your situation, we thought to call your... Is it Jenny? Can I please talk to Jenny? Communication not clear. - Do you read me? - Jenny? Do you hear me? Babe! Baby, it's... Jenny... I'm so sorry. I messed everything up as usual. So you don't have to say that everything is gonna be okay this way. You don't... have to say that that's our deal... That I break everything and you fix it... 'cause I broke our deal. I shouldn't have gone. I should've stayed... I should've done so many things different... but everything I touch falls apart. Everything beautiful gets destroyed... and that's why I'm here. I am a free man, but not always a very lucky man. When mine took my leg, I think my life finished. I remember good like yesterday. I very afraid in the hospital. I think only, "I have no leg any more." I think only, "I can do nothing any more." There was a... a radio making music in the hospital and the singer say, ♪ You got to keep moving on ♪ ♪ You got to keep moving on ♪ But I no listen to the singer. I only think about my leg. My leg that was gone and how everything... would be bad in my future. But then a nurse came in and she smiled at... me. And I listened to the song. ♪ You got to keep moving on ♪ ♪ You got to keep moving on ♪ Maybe this bad thing was only way to reach good thing. Huh? This is how I met my wife. She cured me. And our children come. My life with only one leg... is good. You understand what I say? Yeah? Now... This will make you crazy, now, huh. You will see things, huh? And then everything good. Huh, come. Come. Hey, ahh. When I saw your daughter... she brought me my canteen. I take you canteen, Mike is Michael. You're wrong to say you're not a lucky man. She's a beautiful little girl. She has your smile. Huh. I only have three sons... now. My daughter was with me when... mine exploded... many years ago. We take mines together, sell them to guerrillas. Mines very precious. We very poor. She very good. She take stick and put it inside and touch the mine and dig very, very slow, and take out mine and put in tin can. Metal detector don't see difference. But one day... mine take my leg. I no lucky. I get life and her time come before mine. But I happy that desert play tricks on you and make you meet her. I lose a lot for... stand on mine that day. 'Cause I am not a very lucky man like you... but I am free man. I've moved on. I always move on because you've got to keep moving on. I make always next step, even if next step hard and take long and make... scared. You know how not to be scared? Must become... free man. Ahh. Don't go. Don't you leave me too. I got a problem with... some guys at work. I don't think they like me, Rose. I don't know. Maybe just try and relax. Just tell me that you call this respect. I'm sorry, but I was just trying to explain the situation. Just tell me, Rose, that you call this respect. I'm sorry. Well, you don't show it, Rose. I respect you, Bob. You know that. Just don't do that, okay? You're gonna wake Mike. Please. I don't care who I wake. You hear me? In my house... and I deserve respect from you, Rose! - You understand me? - I understand. I respect you, Bob. You know that. I respect you. It's like a war out there, you know, trying to get money to put food on the table for you... For you and that little runt... I... You know, maybe just try to... I don't know... Just stop drinking for a bit, maybe, - that might help. - Shut up, Rose! Hey, baby. Hey. Hey, Mikey. Did I wake you? You have something to say, kid? Let's hear it. Come on, son. I'm right here. Did you wet the bed! He's a child, remember. - Did you go and piss on yourself, Mikey? - Just leave him alone. - He's a chi... No! - Rose! Shut up, Rose! Get out of this house! Just get out! -Is this what you call respect... Rose? You know at your age, kid, I was a man. Don't you dare talk to me that way... in front of... Mikey! So... Mikey, you ain't got no balls, 'eh, kid? That's no problem. I'm gonna show you how to grow some. You have something to say, kid? Let's hear it. I'm right here! Come on. - Come on, boy. - Come on, boy. - I'm right here. - I'm right here. Hey, hey, wait a minute, sweetheart, what's the hurry? Come on, sit down with us for a while, why don't you? We don't bite, you'll see. You know, it's really not the night for this. All right? -Well, then let's make it the right night then. Come on, honey. Come on, sit over here. You got something to say? Let's hear it. Let's hear it. Come on, boy, I'm right here. Hey, hey, Mike. Hey, Mike. Mike! Look at me. Now, you see them over there? The cavalry's finally arrived, Mike. It's a mirage. - I can't do this any more. - No. No, Mike. Mike, that is no mirage. They here, my friend. There's no mirage! Now, we need to tell them that we're here, otherwise they're not gonna find us. Alpha-Margot 4, Alpha-Margot 4, Echo Bravo 3 is in location. Where are you, Sergeant Stevens? Signal your position. I'm here. I'm here! Alpha-Margot 4, we're leaving. - I'm over here. - We can't stay long. We can't find you. Where are you? No, no. No. No, we're over here. Over here. Come on, Mike. Mike, we are not getting anywhere this way. You need to focus. That is one... small step for mankind... but one giant leap for a man. - Can you hear me? - You need to get a move-on. - I'm over here. - 'Cause you're getting married. You remember that? You remember? No, you're dead. Tommy's dead. Do you thus pay homage to our crown and swear fealty on our realm? Your Highness, I hereby swear to be a courageous knight... reverent and courteous always, a champion of truth and justice. And I hereby swear to be honest and good. And I swear to protect our realm and I swear this before you... my princess. Yes. Yes, what? Yes, you will be a courageous... courageous knight. Stay alive, Mike is Michael. You have to let me go, Mike. Don't be afraid to stop suffering, sweetheart. I'm not... not any more. You're a strong boy. You're honest... and you're good. And I know that no one's ever gonna stop you... ever. But you have to let me go. You have to move on. Come on, son! I'm right here! Can I get that beer now please? Jenny? That's why you're here, Mike. That's why you're here. You have to move on. Seven percent. Good.
