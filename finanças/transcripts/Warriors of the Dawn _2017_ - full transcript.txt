"The practice of the rich hiring the poor..." "...to serve their compulsory military duties..." "...is prevalent but impossible to stop." "Near the Northern Border," "some men pursue this military substitute jobs as a profession," "known as Proxy Soldiers. From Sejong Chronicles." "Year 1592, Ming Dynasty-Joseon Border" Give it all you've got, and try not to die. He's frozen with terror. Are you afraid... ...of death? Yes, sir... You've got to be terribly scared to kill another man. Courage comes after the fact. Do you know what's the scariest? It's dying before completing proxy service like your father did. Then, one of your kids will be dragged out to suffer the same fate. I will keep that in mind. Here. Jurchen's blood. Drink it and they can't kill you. Drink up. Don't worry too much. Even the angel of death can't be so heartless to take both father and son. If you run, I'll kill you. Let's go. Cross that border and it's our territory. We'll celebrate big tonight. Charge! Charge! Stab him! Wait! Stop! -You... -I was just like you. Pathetic and miserable life selling for money. I'm Joseon's people! In the Jurchen world, you're ranked by your skills, not your class. You should join us too. I can't stand that hairstyle. Gather up the dead. All of them. -Don't do that. -What's that? Go and check it! Hurry up and gather them. Go to a good place. -What's the head count? -24 in total. We'll be stationed back to Seoul by next year. For sure. Disgusting scavengers. You bastard. Hey! Hwanggae got killed because of you. Do you get it? I'm sorry but I just couldn't... Come here. Stab him. If you don't do it, they'll cut off his head while he's still alive. This is mercy on the battlefield. Stab him! The man you just killed is yourself. So, forget about who you were before. Everything, even your name. Do you hear those bastards? They didn't shed a drop of blood, and they're celebrating. -Yeah, why can't we just eat together... -Gather up, proxies! -Proxy for citizen Park of Onji Village! -Here. Jeong Dooyi of Sukcheon! -Who's the proxy for Jeong Dooyi? -Who is it? -That's you, stupid. -It's me! I've done this shit a dozen times, but I cannot remember this guy's name. Move. Nam Taedong of Pyongdal Village. Did he run? Who's the proxy for Nam? He's dead! Tell his family to send a replacement as soon as possible, or return the money. Show some respect for the dead. Who said anything about being dead? According to this book, Nam is perfectly fine. None of you are dead or alive until you complete your terms. Bring the replacement. How can you expect anyone to stake their lives for so little, and be treated like shit? -How dare you! -Oh my! Then find your replacement and quit! -What the... -Stop it. There are people lining up to be where we are. Don't forget who's feeding your families. You ungrateful bastards! That barbarian will serve his remaining term. -That barbarian? -But he can't be trusted. If you don't complete your term, the underworld won't take you in. So, try not to die. "Warriors of the Dawn" "In 1952, the Japanese invade Joseon with 200,000 troops." "The King of Joseon flees the capital..." "...and heads to Ming Dynasty after hastily installing..." "...the 18 years old Gwanghae as the crown prince." "Yongbyeon, Pyeongan Province" Who are you? We're soldiers traveling from the northern border. The Japanese have taken Pyongyang. Wait here for further instructions. Our priority is His Majesty's safety. There is no nation or people without the King! How can you say that? -In what book does it say that? -Hear, hear. People are what make a nation. If you abandon the people... I will not die in the hands of the Japanese. If I must, I'll do it in Ming dynasty, the only place fit for a king to die. I'll ask the Ming Emperor for reinforcements. Your graceful Majesty, we must at least pretend to fight the Japanese... ...before we request reinforcements... How dare you! Are you saying we're running away? No. The vice minister has a point. Someone must stay behind. We can't all go to Ming. They won't accept all of us, anyway. I shall divide the court... ...to the Crown Prince. What's taking you? Make haste. Your Highness, how is your nausea? You should take more medicine. Nothing is going to help. Unless it's poison. Don't say such a ghastly thing. Your Highness! Crown Prince Gwanghae is intelligent and humble. He has set a good example by serving his parents and brothers, which makes him an agreeable choice for the throne. He shall carry a responsibility parallel to the king, to lead and protect his people... Take heed, Your Majesty! This is completely unreasonable. Go to Ganggye and give this command to General Shin. Then, he... ...will serve you like a king. You will join forces with him, to gather scattered troops and recruit civilians... ...in order to form a voluntary army. But father! It's preposterous that I'm appointed the Crown Prince, how can I take on this colossal task? What's going to happen to us if Gwanghae actually becomes king? We opposed his appointment to become Crown Prince. He'll first have to complete his task, and come back alive. But anything can happen to him in the chaos of war. From now, you're the King of this country. -Your Majesty! -Your Majesty! -Don't look at them. -Take heed, Your Majesty! If you leave, we'll all die. Keep your promise, Your Majesty! No, Your Majesty! Don't leave us! The governor has already fled the city. Do we have sufficient forces to protect the Crown Prince? Is this really happening? Those that call themselves loyal servants... ...are encouraging the King to run. They'll be held accountable when the time comes. Come on, escort the carriage. Who are those men? Men from the northern region. They're not regular army. The King is going to Ming dynasty to ask for reinforcements. The Crown Prince will be in charge of the branch court. A branch court? Does that make sense? What in heaven's name is that? How can you split the court in two? Hurry up and clear the way! Oh, my. Move out of the way. Don't push! No swords! Out of the way. -Stand back. -Get out of the way! How can the King do this? Stand back. Get them out of the way! Please, do not abandon us! Your Majesty! Get out of the way. I thought I'd already seen hell. But nothing like what happened here. This isn't what we signed up for. Let's get out of here. Proxies that abandon their posts are punishable by death. What do you think, Towoo? Is it even possible to make it to Ganggye? -Soedol. -Yes, sir. When things are clear, go back to the village. Gather all our families and evacuate them. Where should they go? Follow the King's group. That's the only way they'll survive. We'll catch up with them when all of this is over. -Hurry up! -Yes, sir. Take care. The country's falling apart! Who gives a damn about service time? Even if the country falls, our fate stays the same. A branch court? This bunch is ramshackle. Listen carefully. You've been given the serious role of escorting the Crown Prince. If you hurt a hair on his head or if you try to run, you will be killed immediately, understood? We will fulfill our duties, but only until our proxy term expires in a month. Then, we return and look after our families. What did you say? Do you want to die? Think you can come and go as you please? We stake our lives to make a living, but we are not slaves. You've already broken military law that is punishable by death. Enough. We should be working together, not fighting each other. As soon as we arrive in Ganggye, we'll hold military service exams. Since we're in the middle of a war, you can join the official army if you can shoot an arrow. Can we be patrol officers too? And any other things you want. The point is that you'll be official and not be treated poorly. No more serving for someone else. If only that's possible... Patrol officers get three bags of rice a month. -Three bags? -Get ready to leave. If you make a significant contribution during the war, a slave can be freed, even rewarded official status. This could be our big break. A drowning man will say anything to save himself. I wouldn't trust him very much. If they go back on their words, I'll shove them right into a Japanese sword myself. You saw them. Maybe it's not the Japanese we should fear the most. We won't serve a king who abandon his people just to save his own life. So we bring you one of his sons. Please take him and end this war. And stop killing each other. I have no authority. Although I'm the eldest, the crown belongs to my younger brother. Joseon's royal court has split. He's now the de facto king. So, it's him you want, not me. Let me go. The men sent to Pyongyang failed to capture the King, so if we can get the Crown Prince, it'll be a monumental achievement. What's the rush? Let the people of Joseon capture him just like they did Imhae. Take your men and find the Crown Prince. Lord Hideyoshi will be pleased with what we have done. We'll get there in about 10 days. The sooner, the better. We must stay ahead of the enemy. Keep an eye on His Highness. He might run away again. How dare you fall asleep? He treats that damn flag better than he treats us. Why are there two dragons? Male and female. Even dragons can get lonely. My goodness. He lets the court ladies clean him, even his balls. Who will volunteer to fight... ...for a frail king like that? Volunteer to fight? For whom? He'll pretend to clean up after his father then give up. What choice do we have? I'd do anything if he can change my fate. Mencius said if a sovereign looks after his people like he looks after his own children, his subjects will follow him as sheep follow the shepherd. While some feudal lords may send their subjects... ...to the battlefield in order to expand their territory, if you protect them and give them a good life... Why the hell is he studying at a time like this? Looking at that moon, reminds me of home. I'm worried about my family. Don't worry about your family. Soedol is a clever boy. He'll have evacuated them to safety. This war wouldn't last that long. We'll be back in no time. What's that? Will-o'-the-wisp? -What's that? -What? -It's coming this way. -What's that? Take cover! It's the Japanese! To the position. Protect the prince. Stay focused! Your Highness! Come out. Come out, Your Highness! -Don't touch me. -Come with me! My books... Let me go! My book! Your Highness! Stay down. Your Highness! Are you hurt, Your Highness? Looks like they're gone. Who could they be? Who are they? -What the... -Bring the water. Good heavens... Look at this arrowhead. It's a serious weapon. They used horn bows. The Japanese doesn't use them. And the attack was concentrated. It doesn't look like bandits either. Then, who are they? -Come here. -What is it? Because of you, I lost the books that I cherish more than my life. Books? You can get books any time, but you only have one life. I've told you, I cherish them more than my life! Take heed, Your Highness! He was only trying to save you. Please show mercy. What about you? Where were you? How can you allow this to happen? Punish me by death! But I'll find out who these attackers were. My goodness. Your Highness, is this expedition worth continuing? Over half of our men are dead or have run off. That's right, Your Highness. We are fish in a barrel on flat land. We should take the mountain path. We know the path. This is not your place to interrupt. Can you carry the carriage through that path? The steep hillside is what makes it safe. Are you suggesting the Crown Prince walks? Enough. The decision will be made by those that make decisions. There's only one man here who can make that decision. We'll be climbing the mountain thanks to the proxies. If they cause trouble, we'll kill them all. Steady... Slowly. Slowly. -Why are you doing this? -Be careful. Lift it up! Wait, wait! Put your back into it! Hey, old man! Someone else takes his place! That god damn carriage will kill us before the Japanese can. That god damn army chief is taking it out on us for nothing. If he does it again, I'll make him regret it. Calm down. We'll have to continue even if the carriage crushes us. Will they hold true on their promise and award us? You need soldiers if you're going to fight a war. They take us or fight by themselves. I'll pass the military exams and change my fate for good. Are you stupid or naive? You believe noblemen's words? Shut your trap, barbarian. Come cross the border with me to Jurchen. That's your best bet if you're looking to turn your fate. No. Why not go to the Japanese? They'll love it if you hand over the Crown Prince. Or be proxies all your life. -What the. -What the. For crying out loud! Stop it. Behave yourselves! We're all dead if this country falls into the hands of the Japanese! Whichever way it goes, this is our last proxy mission. So just keep your mouth shut and go to sleep! Let's sleep now. Darn it. I should have escaped faster. Go to sleep. But Deok... Will the civilian army really gather? I'm just worried about this expedition and its purpose. His Majesty put a big burden on your shoulders. But you must stay strong. I can't fathom what my father wants of me. He rarely accepts my morning greetings. If it wasn't for this war, would I ever have become Crown Prince? The war books were the only hope I had. I know nothing about war. I'm beginning to feel it's all hopeless. Your Highness. Don't worry too much. I only want to be successful. And please my father. Slowly. Be careful of your feet. -Is this the right way? -Careful! -Hold it. -More. Put some back into it, damn it! Your Highness! Are you okay? Your Highness! We can't continue with the carriage. I won't hear of it. It was you that suggested going through the mountains. How did they end up here? I heard they do military duties for others. Isn't that against the law? It's time to go. Prepare the royal carriage. I said we're leaving. -Stand up. -I said stand up! Hey, stand up. -Get up. -Get up. We have no choice but to live like this. Cheer up. -Good heavens! -Is he crazy? That scoundrel! You... Do you realize what you just did? You just committed treason. Imagine that His Highness was in that carriage. You could kill all my men who made mistakes, but the fate of the country would be the same. That will be the real treason. Shut your mouth! Who are you trying to teach? Put that sword away at once. You're in the presence of His Highness, the Crown Prince! -What the... -Hey. Kill that traitorous scoundrel! Stay still. Stop. Enough. Your Highness, do not listen to the unworthy words of a low born. There is no high or low born in reason. I hated riding in that thing, anyway. It was hot and made me nauseous. I felt like dying. We still have a long way to go, so let's move. Make him stand up. He could've decided sooner. Let's go. Are you okay? Please don't kill me. I don't know who the attackers were... ...but I could take you directly to the Crown Prince. He doesn't know who the attackers were. Have Konishi's men made it this far already? This is not one of ours, sir. Who are they, then? Local thieves? I guess we should offer the Crown Prince our protection. Please, spare my life! Let's go. We want him alive, not dead. Yes, sir. Tell the main camp to meet back in Ganggye. Man, I wouldn't be surprised if a tiger jumped out. I haven't seen the barbarian all day. Maybe the tiger got him. There aren't much of him worth eating, and he stinks to high heaven. What is it? Something wrong? Everyone split up! Run! Split! Assassins! Run, Your Highness! My Highness! Help His Highness! If you want to cut your opponent, you must look at him first. Then, without hesitation! Your life or death is decided in a single breath. Stab him, Your Highness. Hurry up! Your Highness! Stab him! Your Highness. Your Highness! It's over, you can come out. Your Highness! Your Highness! Valleys like this are filled with tigers. -Really? -Yes, Your Highness. I saw one following me earlier, smelling my blood. But if you do this, they can't smell you. Was there really a tiger? Of course. It tracked me all the way here. It even tried to kill me. I'm getting out. I'm discordant with water. How did you come in here, if you're scared of water? I guess I'm more scared of tigers. You can only muster courage... ...when you have something to fear. War books tell you never to fight... ...an enemy whose back is to a cliff. I think I'm still looking for my cliff. But you don't seem to be... ...afraid of anything. "Kim Palbok, Hong Manshik, Yi Byungsam..." We only get our real names back after we die. No matter how many times it happens, I can never get used to it. Seeing the men that I fight beside die. This is my fear. How could they have followed us this far? We traveled through deep forest. There's a spy among us. How dare you make such an outrageous claim. Do you have good reason to believe that? What did you find? What... The barbarian... didn't run away. Tell me what you saw. Just like you said, I followed from afar. Somebody lagged behind the group... and tied a note to a branch. I got closer to see his face. But the little rascal ran off. So what did you do? So I went after, and found this. Get him! Traitor! Get him. Conspiracy to treason against the Crown Prince... It must be the western faction who went with the King. Or the supporters of Prince Sinseong? The King already turned to their side. If he wasn't so young, he must've been Crown Prince. Choose your words carefully. Who put you up to this? Was it the western faction? Or was it Prince Imhae's men? Tell me quickly! Is Prince Imhae behind all of this? Answer me. There's no one in the court... ...that wants this expedition to succeed. That includes His Majesty. How dare you speak of His Majesty? Have you lost your mind? How dare you? My father? Do you know the reason? Do you know who your mother was? I don't even know her face. I do. She was a kitchen servant. She won the King's favor and gave birth to you and Imhae, but the King grew tired. -When she died having you... -Shut your mouth! Continue. Every time he sees you, he sees himself. What? The King wasn't a legitimate child himself. He doesn't want another bastard son... ...to succeed him, And, you're not even the eldest. This darn bastard! How dare you! I'll rip out your tongue. Hit him hard. I won't hear any more. I don't want to hear it anymore. Stop! We have to know the truth. This is the only way. -Hey! -Tell us. I'll tell you! I'll tell you... I was only doing what I was told. The man who ordered it was... I said I don't want to know! Leave him alone. Don't you feel sorry for him? How devastated he must be! It's more devastating to not know the truth. These men aren't one of ours. The Crown Prince isn't here. How long has it been since they died? Less than a day. They're not far. Let's go. What about this man? Please, don't kill me! Why the hell does lineage matter in a time like this? They rely on blood when it only poisons the nation. Are we going to get caught in the crossfire? We won't be spared if something happens to the prince. -You all right, man? -Elderly... Come on, get up. There. My goodness. Hey, hey. Hang in there. I say just forget it. We should've never come on this expedition. Let them figure out their own mess. Thinking too much only gets you killed. I don't mind dying fighting the Japanese. We were headed for doom when we beat up those civilians. You wanted to change your fate. Did you expect that to be easy? Change fate, my ass! This wasn't an opportunity. Now it'll get us all killed. So, you want to turn tail and run? What about all these people? Why? Did you make a deal behind us or something? What? Did the prince promise a special status... ...if you see this through? -Damn it! -Hey! Where were you when we were fighting? Why didn't you protect the elder? Come on, man. Stop it! Stop it! Stop! Whatever happened to my brother's life over mine? Calm down. You've changed. You have changed, man. Sure. Who here doesn't want to change? Do you want to die as a shadow? What changes then? He says he can't go further. He wants us to go without him. You'll be fine. We've been through hell and back. We're going home together. Stay strong, Your Highness. My heart suffers more than my body. My mother wouldn't have died... ...if I wasn't born. I tried hard to please my father... ...to make up for the sadness I caused him. But I understand now. He saw himself... ...every time he saw me. That's why he never gave me... ...his love. Your Highness... This will appease your hunger a little. We don't have a choice. Go to a nearby village and find some food. You want us to be robbers now? We should've never come to the mountains. We'll all starve to death thanks to you. Mother... I told you to keep the cliff to your back, not jump off. Your father to Ming dynasty and you, to the afterlife.... Does running away run in your family's genes? I was never meant to be a king. I never even wanted it... ...in the first place. Then why did you bring all those books and manuals? You struck me saying you cherished them more than your life. I was made Crown Prince only to be a sacrifice. The wooden dummy was thrown... ...in the fire in place of the King. A son forsaken by his own father, what's the point of going on? I will never be a king. If I'm gone, people's suffering will end. In my next life, I just want to be born into a normal family. There is no next life. Geoksoo, why did you come back? The elderly died. You knew he wouldn't last. Did you bury him? Isn't that why you left me with him? While I was burying him, I thought what now? Then a face flashed through my mind. Have you gone mad? Why not? Even his own father abandoned him. Like he said, he'll never be king. We have a better chance with the Japanese. Drop the sword or you'll get us all killed. Come with me, bro. Let's go. The Japanese can't be worse than this. If you make me suffer, you are my enemy. If you help me, you are my friend. I'm sick of... this damn country. Even hell would be better than here. Cut his throat already, so there's no turning back. I'll go back and kill everyone then join you. What? Do it. End it for me here. I won't blame you for killing me... ...if it will satisfy your grudge. Go on, Geoksoo. At least, I take comfort in being killed by my own people. When you're in hell, you just keep going forward. Go first. They're missing their noses. The Japanese cut them out. To count the number they kill. They got this far already? They're refugees. They scared me! Come out. They're government army. Come on. It's alright, come on. You should share your food with us. How can you take away the only thing keeping us alive? Even as noblemen, this isn't right. -He's right. -You can't. This branch court must survive to save this country. Go help the soldiers! Stop... Stop what you're doing. We can't give you. Stop it. I said stop. Please stop. Enough! Enough! Stop at once! Because of our failure, enemies have invaded the country, people are dying, and these people... ...have lost their home. And now, you're telling me I should take their food too? It's still cooking. Your Highness, please eat. Rice! In such a long time! How can you be proxy soldiers for a living? I heard it's really tough. I've done it a few times myself. For the magistrate's son. Whether for high or low status, being a proxy is all the same. Wangchun, are you being jealous? Hey, Geoksoo! Give us a song. His voice is so good it makes his senile mother remember who she is. Do I look like I can sing now? I might be able to sing a wailing song. Oh, come on. Singing touches you more deeply in sorrow. When I was in the palace, I used to have someone sing to me whenever I was sad. Sing something. Are you going to ignore my request again? No, Your Highness... I'm just... ...too sober to sing. I can solve that. Your Highness... These people offered me their only sustenance, and I have nothing to give them in return. So I'll dance to soothe their sorrow. I once thought, if I ever run into the King... I'd cut his throat myself.. People living in the border region... ...were relocated there by the government to protect the border. Then, they never let us... ...pass the first round of the exam. We are excluded before we can even try. So, what choice do we have? Working as proxies is our only choice to feed our families. My mother was a professional mourner. She would cry all night at a stranger's funeral for money. When I was sent away to be a palace maid at 12, I cried my eyes out all night. Now, I've accepted it as my fate to live and die within the walls of the palace. But there are times when I feel like my life is tiring too. How far do we have left? It's just after this plain. We'll arrive in half an hour. We'll start recruiting the civilian army as soon as we're there. And hold military exams too? -Want to take a look? -Yes. Wow! Is the military exam hard? You were pretty good. You'll pass without a problem. Who knows, some good might come out of this. I wish I could be like you. -Move. -Stay down. Your Highness! The royal flag... It shows that King is present. Guard it with your life. And... Protect His Highness. Kill them! What is it? What are you going to do? Here. Meet back in the woods. At the end of the prairie. Towoo! Go! Hurry up, let's go. There they come. Good Heavens, you came back safe! At last! We arrive in Ganggye. They burned down everything and fled. Those bastards. We've been through hell and back to get here. My goodness, it's a total mess. What the... Then... What about the military exams? We should be thankful to be alive. "The King fled to Euiju. Hurry up and catch him." -What the... -Soedol! Hey, what happened? We had to cross a river... However, they burned the boats. The King's men. To keep the enemy at bay? Yes. But even before the refugees crossed. Where are they now? They went back to the mountains to hide in the caves. And you came here by yourself to give us the news? Then... Our families are safe, right? And my mother too? At that time... Some people tried to cross on a make-shift raft... ...and fell in the water. Your mother fell too. I'm sorry... She drowned? -I'm sorry. -God damn animals! -Geoksoo... -Geoksoo! Geoksoo! Your Highness, we must hurry and leave now. How can I disobey His Majesty's command? Your Highness. This convoy has become defenseless. We put word out for voluntary soldiers to come here. Then, we contact General Shin and devise plans of defense. You can't rely on peasants to defend the court. They hate the court. We don't even know where General Shin is. We should just send a message to the King and leave. -He's right, Your Highness. -Your Highness. We'll go our own way from here. No, you can't yet. As you can see, we have to retreat from here but we don't have any soldiers. What more do you ask of us? -Be quiet. -I won't. -And what about our exam? -That's enough. Let them go. They... ... did what they promised to do. It's us who didn't meet our end of the bargain. You can go. We're sorry. You have nothing to apologize for. Besides, where else could I go now? By the way, I should leave this flag in your care. You sure you don't want to... ...join the barbarians with me? Just kidding. Travel safe, you proxies. That crazy bastard. Shit! When did they get this far? They must be heading for Ganggye. Shouldn't we warn them at least? To get out of the city? Don't be ridiculous. It's out of our hands now. We just keep going. Come on. Let's go. I need to let them know. What's the matter with you, man? Hey, Towoo, I understand how you feel, but we owe them nothing. Go on without me. I can go by myself. Think about your family! You've done more than enough. What could I do for my family? Besides eating the little food they've got? But these people will be slaughtered if I don't warn them, Including the Crown Prince. -My dear... -Who cares? It's not going to change anything. Only my poor mother died, and what? Why do we need to help them? For what? For what, damn it? Who knows, we might save a good king for the future? Come on, man. Whoever becomes the King is not going to change our lives. It's useless. The only way for us is to push through this madness somehow. Your proxy term is complete. Go home, all of you. -Towoo! -Towoo... -Towoo! -Towoo! -Hey. -Geoksoo! -Geoksoo, stop! -Let me go. -Geoksoo! -Don't touch me! Is he crazy? Come on, Geoksoo. Come back here! Is this all... ...His Majesty said? Yes, Your Highness. Since the Ming's military intervention was arranged with much difficulty, you are to go back to aide the Ming's commanders. Thank God. So I'm to go back? What about Ganggye? His Majesty did not comment on that. He only said to get there before the Ming army arrives. So you must leave soon. This is for the best. We have the royal command to leave. That's right. We're saved. We're not going to have... ...another riot stopping us? Let's hope not. They'll say the Crown Prince abandoned his people, just like his father. The enemy is heading this way. -What? The Japanese? -Yes, Your Highness. Your Highness... We were given a royal command to leave. We must abide by it. Your highness, he's right. We must leave. Even if we can't fight, we must help them evacuate. There are too many of them. Don't you understand? You're not officially the Crown Prince. Not until the Ming dynasty approve you. In order to obtain their acknowledgment, you must win the Ming's trust. Think about us, your loyal servants, who have risked their lives to make you the Crown Prince. Your Highness. There's a place we can move the people to. Where? There's a mountain fortress a few miles away. Do you want to go there? Will it hold everyone? And there's a cliff behind the fortress. It'll be very scary to have it on your back. You just won't listen to your leader, will you? We couldn't let you get all the credit for saving a king. We ran into these monks and came back with them. We heard that Your Highness was here, so we came over. Where's Geoksoo? He didn't come with us. What was that? Help us! Help us! -Help us! -Let's go. Let me go. Run! Run quickly. Run quickly! Run quickly. Deok! Hurry up! Run! No matter how hard you run, you can't run away from impending death. A fine welcoming gift for the Crown Prince. Your Highness. Now that we have evacuated the people, we should try to get away in the dark of the night. There's a small boat by the river. In the palace, I've practiced archery. Although I've never shot at a man. Why are you doing this, Your Highness? You've done more than enough. If you disobey the royal command, it's the end of this court. You must think of the greater cause. A sovereign... ...cannot be concerned with personal emotions. Where does it say that? In what book does it say... ...that people and emotions aren't important? The... The King abandoned an entire nation of people, And he'll do the same to his son. He was trying to let you escape. You'll only bruise his conscience further by trying to be honorable. That's how the world works. If you fall out of his favor now, everything will go to ruins. Are you really going to be a disloyal son? You should at least pretend to follow him. A father and son's relationship... ...is the trivial thing. When in the face of war. That's how he could abandon his own son. I too, shall sacrifice it for the greater cause. Your Highness, everyone has their place and duty. You must leave the fight to us, the fighters. No. I'm no different than you. You know just as I do... ...that I'm here as my father's proxy. But... How can you live the life of another person? When you are only given your own life? Now, there is no one here for anyone else. From now, we all fight for ourselves, not for someone else. It's the King's flag. So, he wants to fight? At least, he's better than his father. Shouldn't we send for backup from the main camp? That won't be necessary. These people... ...are weak and outnumbered. This man came to us voluntarily, claims he knows the prince's face. What did I tell you? The Joseon's people will bring him to us. If you open the gates, I'll bring the Crown Prince to you. If you spare my innocent comrades' lives. Get ready for battle. Yes, sir! Prepare battle! Yes, sir! Make haste. Shoot! Your Highness, it's dangerous up here. Go down! Hurry up! I'm fine. There are plenty of princes in Joseon. Besides, I already broke the royal command. Your Highness. Over here. Bring in the firing squad. Yes, sir. Firing squad, ready. Are you alright? I'm going to kill you. Let me go. Why are you lying down like this? Open your eyes. Mother. We've run out of arrows. These are all we've got left. Listen, all of you! -Listen, all of you! -What is he up to? Send out the Crown Prince. And these men will leave immediately. Isn't that Geoksoo? If he doesn't surrender himself, they'll seize the fortress, and slaughter all of you. I heard about him. Hurry up and send the Crown Prince out. He lost his mother. Look at them! Save us, Your Highness! Damn it! Stop killing innocent people! That bastard. Send out the Crown Prince now. Do you all want to die like dogs? Somebody must take responsibility for ruining this country. Are you going to kill all these innocent people? Towoo! That bastard. Joseung! -That crazy bastard. -Come out. What are you doing there? Why are you giving your lives to a country that's done nothing for you? For crying out loud... What are you doing there, Geoksoo? It's over. This country is finished. There's no virtue in what you're doing. Geoksoo! We are not going to die! We will walk out of here alive. I don't resent you! And voluntary soldiers will hear about the Crown Prince and flock here in droves. Do you remember that time... when we were besieged by the Jurchens? We held off a whole month... ...feeding off dead bodies. But no one came for us. It's just like that time. You'll either starve to death or get killed by the enemy. I'm not doing this just to save myself! Your Highness! Surrender yourself. Give yourself up. Please... Please... ...save us. I know you are a man of good nature. Save us, I beg you. Save your people, Your Highness! Please save us! Please save us. Your Highness... -Save our lives! -Your Highness! Your Highness... Give yourself up. Only you can save us. What are you doing, Your Highness? I must go. You can't. It's me they want. I know war well. Even if you surrender, they will rape our women, and still kill us all. There is no mercy for those that surrender. Why do you think there's a cliff behind the fortress? Then... Am I supposed to just watch idly? Yes! Giving up myself is their only chance. You can't go now. -You can't go. -Let me go. Let me go. No! You must face your fears. You know what my biggest fear is? It's to watch all of you die. That's my fear. Are you alright, Your Highness? Take heed, Your Highness. You can't go. Who is he? Did I come out right? Barbarian! -I thought you'd left! -Gone? I was only getting recruits. The refugees told us that you were here. There are about a hundred voluntary soldiers gathered out there. How big is the burrow? It was built for scouting purpose, not as a passage. So it's very small. The only way for all of us to escape is through the gate. With the volunteer army outside, it's doable. Get them on standby by daybreak. Let's do it quickly. My goodness. Do it faster. Bring me some nail. Hurry up. My dear... Be careful, little one. Is this everyone? Do you still not wish to be a king? Would you want... ...to be my subject? What is... ...your name? Your real name. I'll tell you... ...when we get out of here safely. Let's all... ...meet back outside alive. Let's do this. Don't let them get away. If you get defeated by peasants, prepare to disembowel yourselves! -Boat! -There's a boat! Get on. -Come on. -Hurry! Kids first. Geoksoo! Geoksoo! Towoo! Geoksoo! Your Highness! Always be strong. Your Highness, be strong! God damn it! -Soedol! -Yes! Stay put, I'll come back for my tag. -Towoo! -Towoo! Towoo! Did you really have to do this? Damn it. Towoo... We finished our proxy term. What the hell are we doing here? Does that make us voluntary soldiers? Charge! Don't let them get away. More refugees are here. There's no end to it. Is this base... ...under General Shin's command? This is an army base. Refugee camp is over there. I asked, if this was General Shin's camp. Why you want to know? Go tell your general... ...that the King is here. Your Highness! Thank you... ...for traveling... ...hundreds of miles to get here. Your Highness. This way, Your Highness. Long live the King! Long live the King! Long live the King! Do you know... ...why there are two dragons on that flag? One represents the King... and the other, the people, would it not? "Those who took refuge in the mountains and also the other subjects..." "...responded to Prince Gwanghae's call to rise against the invaders...." "...to risk their life and kill the enemy." "This became the driving force for driving out the enemy," "and rebuilding the country later." "-From Seonjo chronicles."
