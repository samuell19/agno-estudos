Subtitles by explosiveskull No coverage. You have to be kidding. No coverage? Guys, we don't need modern technology. We came out here for nature, peace, and quiet. Rach, it actually is kinda cool that we get to stay at your uncle's campground. Complete with an RV. Ooh, yeah. Two days of peaceful bliss. No noisy city... No pollution, no smog, no processed food. I've never heard of anyone owning their own campground. Usually, those are owned by the state. - Right? - Yeah. I wonder how he bought it. Or why he bought it. Maybe he's a serial killer who takes his victims' bodies, buries them in the woods underneath the campground. No, no, no, no. He is mad scientist who dissects alien body parts and works for the government. Come on, guys. Stop talking like that, you're giving me the creeps. Actually, I haven't seen him in years. I guess he lived up here because he was some sort of naturalist, and he obsessed with trees. Trees, huh? As in aspens? Aspen trees, oak trees, sycamore, pine, I don't know. You know, I haven't seen him since I was, like, maybe eight years old. My mom really never let us visit him and he never came around. This area is super creepy. I wonder why he can live up here all alone. Found it. Well, my mom said the key would be under one of these tires. I was a key, under which tire would I hide? Hey, I'll yell for y'all when I find it, all right? Not if I find it first! Oh, you're on! It's almost like there's something out there. I'm with Jordan, this place gives me the creeps. Oh, my God! Guys, that wasn't funny. That was so mean. Hey, I found the key. Oh, nice! Thank God. You guys, look at that tree. I've never seen a tree grow back into the ground like that. I'm gonna head in. I'm right behind you, yeah. Me too. - Nice. - Ah, there we go. - Oh, they're on the ceiling? - Wait, how'd you do that? - That's weird, perfect. - Got it. Yo, check it out. He's got a stove? A shower? A little bathroom. Look at this. Even comes fully stocked with water. That's weird. What do you mean? I mean why would there be water? My uncle's been missing for over two years now. Nobody's seen him. We got access to the RV because my mom paid the lot dues back, but I thought it was completely empty. So you mean to tell me we're staying on the lot of your dead uncle? I never said he was dead, you guys. We just don't know what happened to him. Guys, we're here now, we got this whole place for the weekend. Let's make the best of it. I agree. Anybody out here?! No, I've just never seen trees look like this. This whole place is creepy. It is a little bit different, but hey, like T said, let's make the best of it. What do you think really happened to Rachel's uncle? You know, I don't know. The whole story is really creepy to me. The sky is so gloomy. It's almost creepy and romantic at the same time, you know? Yeah. Guess so. Jordan. Guys doing? Oh, we weren't doing anything. Nothing happened, we were just talking. Okay, well, come inside, or you're sleeping out there all night. Do you think they know about us? Yeah, they know about us. Why are you being so secretive? 'Cause I want to keep what we have between us. You know how everyone gets when they find out, start being nosy. Hey, guys. Heather and I are gonna work on tomorrow's hiking route. Sure you are. Uh-huh. Of course we know about you and Heather. Staying in the same room, bro. Lots of friends sleep in the same room. All right, to be honest, we're not trying to rush into anything. We even brought two separate sleeping bags. What do you mean you brought two separate sleeping bags? I mean, sex complicates things, and we don't want to ruin the good friendship we have. All right. I can respect that. So, let's get back to this love triangle of yours. Rachel or Jordan? You know, Rach is more of my type. You don't have a type. That may be so, but if I did, it would be her. What would be her? Um, nobody. We're just, you know, getting this luggage in. Oh, well, I came to help. Ah, we're good. You sure? Oh, yeah. We're good. Okay. All right, man, let's go ahead, get this stuff in, all right? Yeah. Now, Rach, this uncle of yours, he just disappeared and nobody has seen him since? From what I know, he was really into preserving nature. And he was really into the existence of other life. I don't know what happened to him. Wait, you mean alien life? Let me get this straight. You brought us out on a camping trip to an RV site owned by your dead, oh, I'm sorry, missing uncle, who's some freaking tree nut and alien lover? You know what, no, this is crazy. I say we go home. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. We are not going home. I'm sorry, guys. I guess I should have told you. I just didn't think it'd be that big of a deal. Oh, Rach, it's not a big deal. You guys, we're gonna have a great trip. We're gonna be fine. I think we're gonna go to bed, guys. We've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow. If we all survive. Ooh! You guys, we need to make sure all these windows are locked and these blinds are closed so some weirdo can't just come up in here and look in. We are out in the middle of nowhere. We're fine. No. No, I heard that bears can unlock windows and unlock door. Jordan, the door locks from the inside. How about this? Let's turn these lights off and go to sleep. What do you think of this place? It's pretty creepy, huh? Yeah, it is pretty creepy. Nothing a little kiss wouldn't fix. Now you want to kiss me? What is our next step? Next step? What do you mean? Like, where is this relationship going? Not now, Heather. I just want to relax and enjoy this trip. Let's just take things slow, minute by minute, day by day. Fine. What's going on? I don't know, I... I thought I saw something. Like what? What are you doing up? I'm sorry, guys. It was nothing. Go back to sleep, please. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah. All right. Can I help you? Good morning, ma'am. My name is Sheriff Po. Sheriff, huh? Yes, ma'am. Don't get a lot of travelers around these parts, and I noticed that all of the doors on your vehicle's wide open. T and DJ must have left those open. Left what door open? This is Sheriff Po. He said you guys left the SUV doors open all night. I don't remember leaving any doors open. I don't know, we were all super tired, maybe you didn't notice. Guess so. Well, like I say, we don't get a lot of visitors around these parts, and kind of stuck out like a sore thumb, if you know what I mean. Well, we just came up here for the weekend to go hiking. So, you guys are hikers, huh? Not really officially, but we all need the nice clean air, and what better place to get it? Wouldn't it be a shame if there wasn't any clean air? Then where would you go? It's all good, son. Clean air, that is. Sheriff Po came by to make sure we were all safe? Yes, ma'am, how long you guys planning on staying? Just the weekend. It's a good weekend. Why's that? Just 'cause, any time surrounded by nature beats anything surrounded by crime, obsession, ignorance, corruption. You know, the normal stuff. So, you're a park ranger and a nature freak, I presume? T, stop it. Ah, it's okay. Not many people would sign up for this job. Hell, I have seen more non-people than I have people. Non-people? You said you see more non-people? Yeah, you know, tree, plant, animal. What do you know about Rachel's uncle? T. Really? I'm so sorry, I told all my friends my uncle disappeared, and now everybody's super curious. Well, do you mind if I take a sit down? I've been standing all day. Please. - Have a seat, Sheriff. - Spot right there for you. Thank you. Well, what do you think happened to him? You mean Dr. Moss? Doctor? I had no idea that he was a doctor. Around these parts, he was known to be a doctor of sorts. The rumor is the person that seen him last was a videographer that he hired that night your uncle disappeared, as in vanished. No traces of foul play, just here one day and gone the next. He loved nature and appreciated her beauty. He also was interested in communicating with life beyond the stars. Yeah, and I understand that he picked this very location 'cause all of the energy in the trees, a way to connect to the other world. Wait, why have I never heard about any of this before? I knew he liked trees and I knew that he believed in aliens, but nothing about his disappearance. Well, maybe they didn't want you to know. Wait, wait, what are we talking about here? Are you really talking about aliens? Aliens? Well, yes, we're talking about connecting with the other world. What does that even mean? I think you mean voluntary abduction. Yeah, sure, I've heard of those. Well, I can neither confirm or... Yeah, yeah, we get it. Confirm or deny. You seem to know a lot about Rach's uncle. Ma'am, I'm the local sheriff. It's my job to know what's going on around here. Heather, move over real quick. This is creepy. Look, y'all, we came up here for fresh air, not to be a part of a Stephen King story. Yeah, I'm with DJ. I mean, this little fairytale is nice and all, but it's a bit much. Well, that's what I heard. Who knows what really happened? Nice meeting you. Well, thank you, Sheriff. Likewise. Guys have a good day. Weird. This is just too freaky for me. Look, I know Po is weird, but at least he's here to protect us. That story about your uncle though. Right? I don't get it. Some Yogi Bear, Po, shows up and tells the story about your uncle and his serious work in alien communication? I mean, really? You guys actually believe this crap? It's like a bull just took a dump all over this place. Well, what do you think happened, T? I don't know, but it ain't the great adventures of Dr. Moss and his incredible alien tree talkies. What's funny is he told the story like it was the truth. I just don't get why my mom never told me any of this. You know, Rach, maybe that's why your family never let you visit out here. I don't know. So, yeah, still no service. This is pointless. All right, everyone, give up your phone. I'm not giving you my phone. Heather, we came out here for nature, peace, and quiet. We don't need phones for that. Fine. Give 'em up. Take it. All right, now, everyone promise, no phones. - Fine. - No phones. Hey, y'all, want to make sure everybody's hydrated on this hike. Everybody good on water? - Yeah. - Don't forget the first aid kit. - Oh, right. - And the compass. - Perfect. - What do you need a compass for when you got me? Four years, Navy comms. I can find anything. Aww. Oh, well, lead the way, sir. Just saying. - Do this! - Here we go. Let's do it. It's what we came here for. Y'all bring enough water? Guys, look at those trees! Wow. Ah. Oh, my gosh. Wow. - Oh, my God. - On, that's amazing. Very cool. You guys, I have never seen trees like this. Agreed. It's almost magical. Yeah. This tree, this tree is like matriarch of all trees. Like, the mother of all trees. Oh, my God, what are you talking about? Here she goes. - Lost it. - Oh, wait, no. This tree is like kids playing in a yard. - You see, like, here... - I don't. I like your imagination. I don't see it though. Yeah, she's lost it. What? - Yeah. - What about this tree? - Yeah, yeah. - Hey, I like it. - Please. - Mm, that's just a tree. What? Can't do that, I like that. You guys, what about this tree? Do you hear that? Yeah, I think I do hear something. Yeah, what is that? I can hear it, but I can't make it out. Yo, this tree's got life. You know, you guys, this tree is creepy. - Yeah. - Time to find a happy tree. Yeah? Okay. I agree with Jordan. Let's hit the path. That is no good. What did you think about it? Oh, it's okay. I mean, like, I'm so tired. I don't know. And yours, they're like little ice cubes. So, anyway, guys, that was great. Yeah, it was, - I really felt it. - Gotta admit, it was a cool experience being so close to nature. - Yeah. - I really felt the connection. I felt the connection, all right, in these boots. Ugh, my feet need relief. - I second that. - I can't believe you wore... Hey, T, what do you think about the hike, man? Where's T? Yo, T. - T! - T? - T! - T! - T! - T, where are you? Taking a piss! What? I'm taking a piss! Taking a piss! Oh! Hey, he's taking a piss. - All righty, then. - Oh, okay. Hey, guys, wait up! Wait up, guys! I'm coming! Think we're almost there. Oh, we can kinda hang out right here. Hey, guys, hold up! - T, we're over here. - There you are. Come on, man. - Hey, hold up. - T. Took you long enough. All right, all right, all right. The dark scary woods. Did you wash your hands? Yeah, in the stream. So, Rach, tell me again why you think your uncle lived way out here. Beats me. We were just talking about that before you disappeared on us. Yeah, jeez, T. Can't take a pee around here. I don't know who in their right mind would want to live up here. I'd go crazy. Got to be a reason though. Well, maybe all this peace and quiet got to him. I don't know. Listen. You hear that? Hear what? Listen. I hear it. I hear it, but I don't know what it is or where it's coming from. Hey, this is wild. What was that? Probably just the wind. Let's get out of here. Yeah, let's get out of here. This is weird. Rachel! What happened?! Did you hear that? What are you talking about? You didn't hear that screaming? Rachel, are you okay? I don't know. Maybe I'm losing it. Let's get you out of this place. Let's get out of here. A little intense. Well, I'll be, made it back. Thank God we did. Oh, no, no, I'm good. Rachel, are you sure you're okay? - Yeah. - Yeah. I don't know. I'm fine. Thanks. Well, I know it's late, guys, but do you want to get a fire going? - No. - It's so creepy out here. I just want to get inside. Yeah, I agree with Heather. Maybe we should just go inside and turn up. - Sounds good. - Okay. Let's get out of the cold. What makes that noise? We should probably get out of here. Come on. Come on, girls. Right behind you. Whatever that was in here. That was crazy. This was supposed to be fun. It was insane. So, please, class, tell me. If there is another life form, say, aliens, then why would they let us destroy this beautiful world, and each other, through war? Anyone? Well, Professor, maybe these aliens want to coexist and share our resources. So, do you believe in aliens? - Ugh. - I do. Oh, DJ, please, explain. Why, sure. See, we're all just energy. Different forms of energy. But it would be naive to think that in this world that we're living in, that there would only one source of energy. If I ever came across another life form, I wouldn't be afraid. - Mm-hm. - Nope. Energy is just energy. BS. If a spaceship came down right now, you'd be squirting from both ends. - Ugh! - No, no, no. I'd be like, what's happening, man? - Really? - Take his hand. Say, I come in peace. And that's when they probe you. Think you got jokes, Jordan. Wait, Rach, what do you believe? I don't know anymore. But I guess our whole world, our whole galaxy, is created from energy, so I can't believe that life neither starts nor ends with just us. Right? That's what I think. Fair enough. You know what? We need to stop all this discussion about aliens. Come on, can't we just relax? Probably a good idea. Class dismissed. Yeah, I can't believe we went as long as we did. I say it's time to take a load off. Off with the shoe. Ooh. Thanks for that anyway. Well, everything seems to work. What do you think? Cooking utensils. Wine opener. Don't do that in the RV. They were brand new. Glad you noticed. Like old newspaper clippings. Guys, look what I found. What is that? Man, your uncle was really into this stuff, like, heavy. Local Doctor Searches for Link Between Worlds? I guess he was a doctor. Local Doctor Ron Moss Furthers His Study of the Connection Between Alien Life and Their Existence Through Trees? There you go. But I wonder why he thought that trees had anything to do with alien life. He must have found something out here. Yeah, but what? Hey, T. Can I talk to you over here for a second? What do you think is really going on? I don't know. This place, Po-Po's story, something doesn't seem right. Yeah, I'm with you on that. I don't know, but Sheriff Po is not everything he's pretending to be. I know that. But his story is so convincing. Yeah, I got to give him that. For some reason, he feels fake, but this story seems real. Yeah, I know. Time will tell what's going on here. I hope so. You and me both, man. So, what happened in here last night? Yeah, 'cause nothing happened out there. Nothing happened in here either. We're taking things slow. He won't commit, will he? No. I knew it. But enough about me, did you tell him yet? Tell him what? You are never gonna get what you want unless you go for it. I know. I know, I almost told him earlier. Okay, well, then pretend I'm DJ. What are you gonna say to me? I'm not doing this. Why not? You better get your practice in now. All right, okay, fine, all right. So, DJ, I've been meaning to tell you something. Tell me about what? Yeah, we'll give you two a minute. Yeah. You're not gonna tell me? No? So, DJ. Yup? I was wondering if you and me could hang out some time. Um, I mean, that's what we're doing right now though, right? Yeah, yeah, but I mean hang out like just you and me, one on one. Yeah, sure. Anytime, yeah. You just let me know when, all right? Why am I wasting my time? You know what? You guys are a bunch of dead heads. It's time to liven this party up. Look, I thought I saw something outside. Jordan, there's nothing out here to be afraid of. Nobody in their right mind would be out here in the middle of the night. You know what, T, why don't you go look? All right. Holy crap, man, what are you doing standing out here? Sorry about that. Just wanted to make sure you guys were good for the night, there being horrible cellphone service out here and all. Out of the way. Don't let a hardworking man just stand out here in the cold. Come on in, Sheriff. - Thank you. - Oh, hey, Sheriff, you're welcome. Hey, Po. Hey, how's it going? - Here, Rachel. - Good. Oh, thanks. Po, what are you doing all the way out here? I was in the neighborhood, just thought I'd stop by, check in on you. Let's get him somewhere to sit. - Oh, my, it's... - Sit down, come on, right here. You want something to drink? All right, what you got? Water. Okay. I think I'm okay on that. Okay. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay, thank you. I thought this was a party. What happened to the music? - I know. - Right? - Turn it up. - Get the beats going. So, Sheriff, I don't know if I've ever met or seen a black forest ranger. You're like a black version of Andy Griffith. There's a first time for everything. Yeah, I guess so. But wait, tell me this. How is it that you can stay out here? I mean, there's no fun, there's no clubs. You don't even have cellphone service. No nothing, I mean, no girlfriend? Actually, there is nothing but life up here. Nature is my girlfriend. What are you guys doing? Oh. Hey. Hey. I never got a chance to tell you how sorry I was about your uncle. That's okay, I really didn't know him. He was a good man. He respected nature and he respected the life that nature breeds. But I thought you said you didn't know him. Well, I heard he was a good man. And what do you mean respected nature? It is estimated that rainforests are being cut down at the rate of 100 trees per minute. The rates for rainforest destruction are 2.4 acres per second, 179 acres per minute, 214,000 acres per day, and 78 million acres per year. Your Dr. Moss committed his life to expanding the minds of you simple people. Okay. I'm sorry. I guess you can say that your uncle was sort of a hero to me. Hero? What he stood for is more than what people can imagine. Hey, is everything okay? Oh, yes, everything's great. - Save you? - Mm-hm. You okay? I'm fine, but something really strange is going on with Po. Well, I mean, I guess he's kinda creepy, cute all in the same breath. Are you kidding? Whatever. Wait, what did he say? Nothing worth repeating. Okay, are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. - All right. Enough is enough. T, what are you doing? All right, Po, what do you think really happened to Dr. Moss? What do you mean what do I think? Well, DJ thinks you're the videographer and you actually killed Dr. Moss. Well, actually, that was T's idea. To be honest, I just think you know more than what you're telling us. You guys, stop it. No, no, actually, did leave out a few details of the story. Well, what happened? There's a reason that your uncle lived up here around all these trees. He believed that trees were the life source to the other world. He just hated the way that man cut down trees and destroyed nature. The rumor is he preferred being around trees because he found a way to communicate. He began reaching out, till one day they reached back. Man, this is like the setup for the ultimate scary movie. Some crazy doctor uses his tree talkies to communicate with aliens? Please, tell me what happened next?! Really, T, stop. Look, man, tell us what the hell happened! He became one with the universe. He became what he sought to protect. He felt robbed in his physical body and he became a tree. To the dust we return. He is now the eye of the outer world. He became a tree? He knew that nature's fury was at its boiling point, so he sacrificed his life. So, he dies, crosses over, and becomes a tree? Not just a tree, but the eyes of the outer world. So what happened to the videographer? So what happened to the videographer? He committed suicide. By the time they discovered the footage, the film had been destroyed by beautiful Mother Nature. Of course, no footage. Funny how everybody who's had a talk with an alien never has any proof. Actually, I don't have the video, but I do have the audio. No way, you have the actual audio? Yes, ma'am. Right out there in my vehicle. I have the audio file saved on my work cell. And how did you get that? Ma'am, I'm the police. Sorry, Po, but I'll believe it when I see it. Well, let's hear it. I want to hear it. Wait, come on, guys. Let's not go digging up stuff. Why? I want to know what happened, for me and my mother. He was her brother after all. Okay. I'll go out to the car and get it. I'll be right back. We got to watch this guy. Something is not right. I'm ready. I'm ready. Must have been the wind. This is crazy. Po, earlier you said that he turned into a tree? He turned into a tree. We found these. And you know where he is! Not for sure, but some people say he's right out here somewhere. Like, around here? In this area? You can go out there, put your ear to certain trees and hear him. I knew something was odd when we were hiking. Well, guys, I didn't want to say it outside and scare everybody, but when we out there, one of the trees kind of pulled me into it. It was like a force or something, like it was talking to me. Well, I say we go outside and find this tree. This is crazy. I'm not going back out there. DJ, bro, get your jacket. I know you're not spooked. We're going tree hunting. And I know you're not scared, cowboy. I'd rather settle a bit before I leave, if it's all the same to you. Fine. I'll go. What? Heather, hand me my jacket. Also, you guys got to find the right tree. All right. Come on, guys, don't do this. Oh, we're doing it. Let's go. Come on, guys. You guys have a good time. God, I can't believe they're just... Great, another flashlight. 'Cause y'all don't want to get caught in the dark. You and T, I assume? Me and T, yeah, we're together, but he doesn't want to commit, which I think is bull. And Rachel and DJ? Yeah, and I'm the lame duck. Not all ducks are lame to me. Oh, I wonder which tree it is. I don't know, maybe that one? Rachel, you all right? Yeah, what are you doing? Where am I? Where did you come from? It's beautiful. Do you know what happened to my uncle? Rachel. Rach. Oh, Rach, what happened?! I was in. Wait, what? I spoke to, I don't know who, I couldn't see his face! This is crazy! What did he say, did he say anything? He said that we're destroying the Earth. He said that trees are the eyes to the other world. He said we're gonna have to pay for what we've done! I've got to see this! - Where did he go?! - T! T! - T! - Where did he go?! T! Come on, Rachel, let's get out of here. Let's go get some help. Whoa, where am I? Am I there? So, are you, like, invisible to us in the real world? Huh? Who are they? Oh, the other world? Born again? So, what are you painting? Whoa, what's going on here? Help, guys! Get me out of this place! There is something freaky in here! Help! Rachel?! DJ?! Heather?! Please, help! Where's T? Heather, we have something to say. Oh, my God, where is he? We don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Look, I got in. Wait, so you guys found the tree? What do you mean "got in"? I got in and I made contact. Where is my boyfriend?! Heather, you got to calm down so we can tell you exactly what happened, all right? Look. Three of us went out there, found the tree that I saw earlier. Then what happened? Went to go put my hand on it and I was sucked in, where I saw this man painting a picture. Wait, Rach, tell them what you told me. He told me that mankind was gonna have to pay for the destruction of nature, and that Mother Nature was gonna somehow undo all of our wrongs. So I got close, and I went to just touch the man, and before he could turn around, I was out. You don't tell me where T is, I'm going to go find him. Heather, look, T was just excited that Rachel connected and then he just... Don't tell me he tried to touch the tree. And he was just gone. What do you mean "gone"? He was just gone! We turned around for maybe a second, and then he was just gone! No, no, no, no, no. Wait, did you guys go look for him? You know, T's always playing jokes. No, this isn't a joke. T is actually gone. Can't just be gone! We have to go back out and find him! Hold on, hold on. Hold your horses. Now, I'm gonna head back to the station and gather a few volunteers to walk the back area of the trees. Maybe he just got disoriented and wondered off. Don't you worry, we're gonna find him. You guys just hold out and hang out for a minute. Don't you go back out there. Wait, Sheriff. Thank you for helping us find T. Whatever I can do, ma'am. Look, Po will find him. I'm sure he just ran off. This is all too creepy. I just want to go home. Seriously, I've been wanting to go home. Look, they're gonna find T, we'll get a good night's rest, and first thing in the morning, we're leaving. Can't just stand here while he's out there. Heather, it is way too dark for us to go outside right now. Let's just let Sheriff Po find him. I mean, he's a sheriff, and he's got all the resources. Yeah, as much I want to go back out there, DJ's right. Yeah, I mean, at least until we figure out what we're dealing with. What do you mean? I mean, what if there's aliens outside right now trying to kill us, all because of the way society degrades nature? Then what? Pray. Let's stay positive, and know that T will be found and he'll be back. What if we're too late? Too late for what? Where is that damn officer? Heather, calm down! He just left. I'm gonna go find him. - No, wait. - Wait. - No. - That's not a good idea. No, you're not. It's too late, it's too dark, and it's obviously dangerous. We have to wait for them to come back. Heather, I just don't think that's a good idea. You didn't need help, he'd still be here. So now it's my fault?! Yeah, kind of! Wait, wait, wait, it's nobody's fault. Come on, let's just be reasonable here. And reasonable is leaving your friend in the woods? Heather, I am just as scared as you are. We have to wait, make the best decision. The best decision is going out and finding him. Heather, no. Heather! No. Look, I'm gonna go after her before she gets too far. Heather, wait! Heather, wait! Heather, please don't go out there. I have to find him! Look, Heather, just don't go running out there. Listen, Po will get a team, he's gonna find T. - Trust me. - You trust him?! Do we have a choice, Heather? Think he has something to hide. Look, I don't know that we're gonna find him, just don't go running out there. - No, I have to find him! - Heather, please! - I have to find him! - Heather, Heather! No, I have to find him! - Heather, come on, no! - T! T! T! T, where are you? T! T! T! Heather, wait! Stop that tapping! Wait! Heather, wait! Come back! DJ. DJ. What did you do to him?! Hey, Rachel. Hey, are you okay? What happened? Well, we looked all night for T and we couldn't him. Matter of fact, we couldn't find anyone. We got to head back to the station. File a missing person report. Here, drink some water. Better get going. There's nothing left to see here. And until this day, no one knows what happened to Rachel and her friends on lot 24. Subtitles by explosiveskull
