Huge thanks to Isaac and Elizabeth for their invaluable help with the translation "112" "112" This is "112" "112", why didn't you reply? Fire in the engine Can I use the extinguisher? Belay extinguisher! You won't be able to start the engine again! That's affirmative Drift down to 3000 feet, aim the plane to the field And bail out, copy? That's affirmative, drifting down Markelov, did you prepare the plane? Markelov, are you deaf or what? Did you remove the pin from the catapulte? "112", Leonov? What's going on there? Why aren't you answering? I order you to... Damn... He turned off the engine What the... Drive straight to the runway - Yes, sir Comrade colonel, the committee has arrived - Which committee! General Kamanin It's like he's blowing the engine Come on, buddy... Buddy, come on There we go! Hold on! Lyoha... Lyoha! Markelov... Scallywag Comrade lieutenant general! The comander of the 294th nonintegrated reconnoitring... - At ease And what are you doing here? Circus performance, ya know, with visual effects Lyoha, are you ok? Why you didn't jump? We all almost turned grey! - Here, hide it And what will we say? Eh, Lyoha? - Well, uh, uh... We'll say we were saving expensive Soviet equipment Come on! The equipment isn't new... The engine went wack But we'll deal with it and find whose that's fault - Who is the pilot? Lieutenant Leonov Well, there will be a special talk with him Honestly, he's crazy - Send him to me We're just looking for ones The Time of Pioneer Yevgeny Mironov Konstantin Khabensky Vladimir Ilyin Anatoly Kotenyov, Alexandra Ursulyak, Alexandr Novin, Yelena Panova Experimental construction department No.1 1963 In 65th! In 65th You all free I said, you are free How so, in 65th? Why? It supposted to be in 67th By that year Voskhod 2 could be prepared hundred-per-cent. Why? Because the Americans have moved their flight Now they are planning their spacewalk before us It's unacceptable But to allow an unprepared product into space With "USSR" letters on its broadside... Is acceptable? To fall flat on our face in front of the whole world. Is acceptable? And get to heroic corpses instead of two alive heroes and cosmonauts We'll prepare the spacecraft carefully as we can But the period of time is too short... Two spacecrafts The first one is a test We'll work over all our mistakes on it And then... Our Voskhod 2 will fly Sergey Pavlovich, but even if we can be on time with the two spacecrafts Voskhod must go almost immediately And I cannot understand... How we are going to ensure absolute reliability of all systems We'll work over the maximum amount of extraordinary situations then... And then... Hope for people Thank God, we have the two best pilots How many combat missions did you have on the front? Stop bugging me, Lyosh We're approaching the disembarking point The ceiling is really low. And the wind is the wind increasing. - How low? - Ceiling is 1300 feet, without light gaps The wind is 12 points, gusty. Are we going back? We are Why? It's fun with the wind With such a wind, it would be fun if out of ten times, at least one was without consequence. Take it! Will we back off in space too? There will be different instructions in space, Lyosh What did they choose us for? Why us, why not someone else? I haven't thought about that yet To handle impossible tasks Eat, the apple is tasty I'll eat at home Lyosh, you didn't get it? We aren't jumping now - Who's to say? - The instructions Don't get bored, chap Vlad! Close Stay calm, Pash Unwind! Unwind! Feet together! What? Feet together! Come along Come on Lyoha! Don't touch The bird won't come back if it knows that you touched them Is it its house? It is And it also sleeps here? Who knows But dad, tell me, where does the bird sleep? If you want to know, you'll find out. Come! Lyoshka! Let's go The meaning is correct, but the form is not There is a lack of formal tone - Comrade general, permission to speak? - No I'm sorry, may I ask... Give a decree, so they let me visit lieutenant colonel Belyaev - The doctors will decide - They have already decided... But he doesn't want to see anyone... He's upset I want to maintain my comrade's morale, please - What's with your leg? - Oh, it just fell asleep Leonov Do you know why I didn't give you a kick in the pants yet? Negative, sir Neither do I - Continue the training activity - Thank you Comrade general, we'll do it! Pavel will leave the hospital, and you'll see... - Major Khrunov is your new partner - How so? But Pavel...? Please, listen! That's not his fault, honestly. I jumped first, you understand... - I provoked him... - I know, I read it in your report Don't worry, Belyaev will rest for a while, get some treatment The officer isn't young, almost forty Let him regain his health But we have no right to slow down the program You are training with Khrunov for now Yes, sir The dinner is getting cold Looks like it Sveta, I've already told you, that "looks like it" Is the worst compliment for an artist It's not a comliment for an artist, but it's for a cosmonaut with a paintbrush Who, by the way, could have become a very good artist Please, you're blocking my light... But what about space? For a real artist, in order to get into space It's not necessary to fly there on a rocket But I see the stars throught the ceiling No, it's rather... I don't see the ceiling, but only the sky I would.. I would reach the Moon on a bike But there are not such bikes Dinner is ready! Oh, daddy, may I take the apple? - Hey, after dinner - So let's go have dinner now Hiya! Well, I see... Right, keep silent I will speak So... We start the program to restore physical form I have just one life And just one workmate too I won't fly with others Of course, I'm training with Khrunov now, but that's to keep the trainings going And as soon as you're back, we go to the supervisors And file a report for the medical board, understand, and everything will be fine Woah... That's good that you don't have a fracture, right? That's really good! An old injure got worse, but that is... That's such a trifle, that's "pff", it'll heal up Some people get their head split open. But you a leg Alexey, look at me and hear me I will fly with you nowhere And why do I disgust you so much? That's not it You have no fear, and that's bad Hey, I'll tell you a story from my childhood... - Get away! - And you'll understand at once what I'm talking about You didn't understand me? Don't be ridiculous. Leonov doesn't leave just like that? I'll do my work now and then leave Easy, easy Ok. Swing And one, two.. One! Two... Let me help! Painful? Ah! Get away! What happened, comrade Belyaev? Go away from here! Everything is fine, we figured it out Go away! Right Hello What's there? Do you want me to scratch? You scratch yourself You know what I think? And what do you think? Move faster, is what Yeah, indeed, right How didn't I guess by myself? The spacesuit is 90 pounds Every extra movement causes the inertia Also, you can't see anything when you go feet first Well, then a break No! Once more In an hour Why, during all those zero-gravity sessions, Didn't you have any successful attempts of entry into the airlock? What is the hindrance, comrade major? Well, there are actually a number of reasons. One of them is... the spacesuit Comrade chief designer, it's called "Eagle"... But it's rather an asbestos coffin. Sorry But I have a suggestion, can I? Boris Victorovich! So in order to pull up the tether and control your movements You need more agility Here, please, note – linkage joints At the elbow, knee, carpal bends For greater freedom of movement - Did you draw it yourself? - Yes, sir They correlate with the total preassure in the spacesuit... Boys, making a spacesuit like that will take two or... two and a half years - We don't have such time, comrade Leonov - I see, Sergey Pavlovich - But what if we shift the tether attachment point to the helmet - Excuse me, what? Why? - Our cosmonaut enters the airlock feet foremost, right? I feel, it woud be better, if the cosmonaut can see where he is going And get into the airlock head foremost Comrades, leave us for three minutes Go ahead - Me? - Yes How exactly do you want? Head foremost? You are requested Come on Well And now turn back to face the hatch Why? In order to close the outer hatch Manually But it's automatic It's automatic 9 times of 10 Let's assume you are out of luck And now imagine, that you are in an inflexible spacesuit And oxygen is running out - Have you imagined? - Yes That's all, you're dead And your mate too Now we know, Sergey Pavlovich We'll be working on the running task And sorry for bothering you Sergey Pavlovich We are ready to fly even in shackles, even in mail We're already people, who fly in shackles from birth But imagine, if they were removed What would be... We'd lose balance and crash That's who we are Go Yes, sir The drawing Leave it Yevgeny Anatolievich Belyaev is bad! How? Uhh... Comrade Belyaev Dear, what are you doing? As you said, excersising the leg But I meant little by little Gradually, with time I don't have time, Evgeny Anatolievich Oh! The old pilot amazes - You know, what I like most about you, Khrunov? - What? Your smile Smile again What a smile! Pasha! Welcome back! Squad! Draw up! Front leaning rest position! I'm sorry - Comrade Belyaev, join up - Yes, sir - Welcome back! - Thank you And one, two... Experimental construction department No.1 120 days before launch Nikishin! Nikishin! It's time to go home and get enough sleep Finish tomorrow Segey Pavlovich, people need rest They've been toiling for three weeks three-shifts Right after the visitation Everyone will get a dayoff One day - Maybe, let's put the chairman of the committee in the spaceship To feel like Gagarin and be content Then to the celebration dinner and a kick in the pants - A kick in the pants is ok But no outsiders in the spaceship, even Brezhnev What is it? Nikishin? - Step aside Shine it on the chest and head area What? Dead - My God I want to know exactly what happened Exactly Boris Evseevich, report back to me what occurred in half an hour With the electrics - Sure I take it that the visitation is cancelled? - No way! I want them to see all this We desperately need them to see it May they report back to whom they should The beginning was better, comrade colonel Half a second Please, give it to Svetlana Egorovna - Yes, sure - In honor of a nice sunny day - - Ok - And her wise decision - What is this? - Someone asked to give it to you Put it here So, comrade colonel By now I don't have claim to you Let's change the workload, and then we'll check the pressure Well, for our ladies! Hooray! And... By the way, what do I call a lady who is a cosmonaut? Female cosmonaut or lady cosmonaut? We've said already, "for ladies"... How did it go with the medical commission? What did they say? Didn't let me pass. Their decision Stop, wait a second... What do you mean, "decision"? What did they give as a reason? Anything specific? "No go. Age, injuries," they say "You can't run well with a bum leg" - I see So you backed off? So who I'm going to fly with now? You are my workmate - Why are you deserting me? - Lyosh, what are you up to? Am I your workmate? There is your workmate We don't serve our own whims, but the common goal The doctors are right, I'm ill-suited for the task I don't care about the doctors. If I fly, it's only with you Are you really going to run in space? - The Chief Designer is going! Fall in! 'ten-shun! Run or not You can't outrun fate Things didn't work out for me Can't outrun? Lyosh! Lyosh! It seems we must conquer space without them now Are you out of your mind, comrade major? Do you want to be thrown out of the squad? Comrade general! Permission to speak, sir? Did you want anything, comrade Leonov? Did you see him running? Did you? So he's able. Not half able - That's all? - Yes. I mean yes, sir - You're free - Yes, sir You're free I'd like to see the results of the medical commission "Zero gravity" Almaz-2 in the airlock Well done, Almaz Well, we'll see... About that The day of the launch of the unmanned test module Well, comrades cosmonauts... During the test operations, we'll make a film about your everyday life I feel myself Muslim Magomayev It's good, that not Edita Pyekha Scene 1, take 3 Today we gathered here not to celebrate victory But to verify The possibility of victory - Attention, get ready and... start - Come to dad - Daddy! Ouch! - Easy, easy Stop Let's go again "Key to ignition" I had a bad dream Hey, what a silly thing... Stop The launch of an unmanned module Will be implemented today At 10:30 am Moscow time "Record 2" As you know, the ship will reach an orbit for testing purposes "Key on drainage" - Come on, Svet, people are here, really - That's ok "The space farewell", part 2, scene 3, take 1 Our task is to run a full test of the machinery "Ignition" All key parts of Voskhod 2, including inflatable airlock, Will be understood to be fully tested Once the unmanned module returns to Earth "Start" Dad! We must be sure about the accuracy of our calculations Before the launch of the spacecraft with Pilots-cosmonauts: Pavel Belyaev and Alexey Leonov "The spacecraft has reached the orbit" Our heroes, who we pin a special mission "The airlock is open" We will go outside the capsule for the first time ever And have a spacewalk in outer space "Conditional spacewalk has been implemented" The success of this flight will help us in reaching the moment When we can be with space as equals Be like friends Take heed! "Attention! The connection with the test module has been lost" "Repeat, the connection with the test module has been lost" Confirm, observing the cloud of wreckage Good to see you, Sergey Pavlovich - Good to see you - You are kindly requested "I pledge the Soviet government" "Esteemed Communist Party" "All soviet people" Good to see you, Leonid Ilyich Wait a moment, Sergey Pavlovich Let's finish the movie and talk I don't have time to watch a movie I can feel Earth slipping under foot It doesn't slip under foot, only for those who make no headway And you're Korolyov, engine for progress I have a complete report here with all technical details Let me try to tell you in short If something isn't clear, ask I know... The spacecraft reached the orbit Conditional spacewalk was implemented Now repeat the same With two cosmonauts. And get a Gold Star - But the spacecraft fell apart. We don't know why. Don't have data - Was there a spacewalk? Conditionally, yes Now do it unconditionally The United States want to launch their spacecraft in May Our Voskhod must fly before So that the whole world knows That we are the first Our space time is happening. Soviet time The time of pioneers I don't care if the Americans will launch first I understand that the main thing for us, for our country... Not to fall flat on our face But While I manage all this An unprepared spacecraft won't go to space All the more, if my people are inside Only over my dead body - Is that a fact? - Yes You know what Think over that And get to work tomorrow There is no one but you Our indispancable When did you rest last? Rest is for the tired I'm not Maybe, you are not, but your heart says the opposite My heart is capricious But I hope we'll make a deal - You know, I don't want to scare you But it can happen any moment. In your place, you know... - Thank you, doctor, that you're not in my place Thank you, that you're in yours It was an honor to meet you Goodbye Cosmonaut's hotel. Baikonur One day before launch I wonder, is it snowing in Moscow too? If so, if I can to ski with the girls Yeah, right... Build a snowman, get some pie Did we prepare for nothing? Enjoy yourself if you want We won't fly? I don't think anything There is the regulation We've spent so much time and effort All sizzle, no steak. But the regulation What do they have for a head? What do you want? You want Korolyov to trust luck and appoint the launch? - Not luck, Pasha, we took apart that ship Cog by cog, and put it back together I have confidence in it like in my own mother But you're just standing and packing Do you think you're the only one who wants to fly to space? You think, you're the only one who wants? I want it as much as.. Ok, well... As Motherland will say... Do I need your orders? I won't back off Yes? - Good morning, Sergey Pavlovich - Good morning, comrade Chief Designer Good morning - You've been up for a while? - No, just got up Drinking tea As you know, the test flight failed Launching Voskhod 2 with people is too risky We'll repeatedly launch an empty module on your rocket We'll build a new one in a year And you'll fly - Alright Why are you upset? The fact that the Americans will be the first? Sergey Pavlovich, we are in peak of physical condition. We worked over... Three thousand emergency situations - There will be 3001st, 3002nd, and 3003rd in space I can't let you go, that's death Eagles Without an obituary - Why did you come then? You're a hillbilly Yes, Listvyanka village That's next to Kemerovo I could die at three, when my father was taken away as "enemy of the people" And we were inked as "family of saboteurs" The neighbors raided at once Took food at first, the furniture, then house Put us out on the street in the frost Mom was pregnant And we, eight kids The neighbor came back, took off my outerwear, I stayed like that In a long shirt Thank God, the older sister with her husband sheltered us A room in a dormitory for workers 170 square feet for all My place was just under the bed But so what, we survived Then the war All men to the front The rest to mobile hospitals, to recreate the industry, defense And to study... My mom brought me to school, I had a look... I'm proud, standing. She looked at my feet The ice melted into puddles. I didn't have shoes But so what, we withstood, survived Then the Victory, yes. But at what price... All uncles, brothers dead And the whole country like that, every family Sergey Pavlovich We went through that We have so much left Not to get scared of an emergency situation I'll gnaw through a hole in the hatch and go out Sergey Pavlovich We are ready to take a risk Strong tea See you later Attention! Comrade general! We are ready for launch Report back to comrade Brezhnev and comrade Kosygin That spaceship Voskhod 2 is ready for launch Yes, sir Zarya, this is Almaz, we are ready Attention! We are one minute to launch Key to ignition Key to ignition go Venting Venting go Key on drainage Key on drainage go Launch Launch go Ignition Ignition go Intermediate Intermediate go Main stage Main stage go Start Start go Good luck Eagles Lift off Lift off contact confirmed All systems work well 25 30 The rocket construction parameters are good 50 60 Pitch, yaw, roll are all good 70 The flight is going well "Attention! This is Moscow broadcast" We are broadcasting across all radio stations... And the central television of the Soviet Union Today, March 18th, 1965, at 10 am Artificial satellite and spaceship Voskhod 2 Was placed in the orbit of planet Earth With the ship continuously maintained radio contact Comrades Belyaev and Leonov are carrying out their work... "In accordance with the flight program" Zarya, this is Almaz Slight vibration All devices are working normally Feeling excellent We stand ready to implement the task Almaz, start to implement the task Copy, Zarya Elongating the airlock Zarya, the airlock has been elongated. We're starting to equalize the pressure in the airlock Zarya, getting ready to enter the airlock Zarya, the airlock pressure has been equalized Switching to the oxygen supply from the backpack Zarya, the spacesuit is pressure-tight, opening the inner hatch of the airlock Don't get bored I'll be soon Pash, push me. Just a little bit. Ooh This is Almaz-2 I'm in the airlock Almaz-2, copy Zarya, this is Almaz, closing the innter hatch of the airlock Zarya, this is Almaz, starting to depressurize the airlock Almaz-2, pressure-relief in the airlock is 5 minutes Pressure is elevated, but within range Almaz-2, your oxygen consumption is above normal Lyosh, breath evenly I'm almost not breathing Attention, get ready Zarya, the airlock pressure is zero Opening the outer hatch of the airlock Almaz-2, give a status report This is Almaz-2, reporting Everything is going well Ready to go outside the ship Begin moving into outer space Copy Almaz-2 Moving into outer space Is permitted Lyosh, make two trips The first is for testing, with loads The second one, for taking photos Copy, Almaz Zarya! This is Almaz-2 I'm on the edge of the airlock Feeling... Excellent! I see clouds, the sea below Caucasus range Right now! Just passed I see sky I see land Volga! Right below Good working conditions! Almaz-2, get ready for departure Yes, copy that Remove the lens cap from the camera I've removed. I've removed the lens cap Where can I put it? Where? Just throw it away - Copy Throwing away Zarya, this is Almaz-2 Pulling out the tether "Soviet Cosmovision is sharing another broadcast from space" From the Voskhod 2 spaceship We are witnessing the event That just yesterday we spoke of only as fantasy... Almaz-2 Begin push off Almaz-2, you can depart Ok, ok, wait a sec Well, I'm off Zvezda, Zary! This is Almaz Man went into outer space Man went into outer space He's now in free flight "Today, March 18th, 1965..." At 11:35 am Moscow time... During the flight of spaceship Voskhod 2 The first ever spacewalk has been implemented; the first man has gone... Into outer space On the second orbit of the flight The second pilot, cosmonaut Major Leonov Alexey Arkhipovich In a special spacesuit With an autonomous life support system Went into Outer space Dad is a real cosmonaut! Real! So, now we only need to learn docking And then we can form space forces Great job! Everyone did well! Stay focused! Comrade general The Kremlin is on the line They ask to connect directly with the cosmonaut Well then connect them - Put them through - Yes, sir Lyosha? - Yes? - Lyosha? - Yes? Who is this? Brezhnev is on the line Leonid Ilyich? Whoa - How are you doing, son? - Reporting My mind is clear, my vision is not disturbed Spatial orientation is normal Man can work in outer space Man can work... ...in outer space - Oh, yeah.. I see how you're tumbling around out there The whole country is watching you And the whole world Thank you - We are proud of you Thanks. Really thank you You come back alive, above all That's an order, do you hear me? Proud to serve the Soviet Union What are his parameters? Pressure and temperature slightly going up, but in general... All parameters are good The air? The air lasts 27 minutes Let's move to the next step Almaz-2 Get ready for push off to test the reaction of vestibular apparatus For the position of the body in space Let's go! Almaz-2, how do you feel? Excellent Ready for the last stage for pictures His pressure rose to 140 over 90. Pulse... 125, temperature 98 F He's worried Who wouldn't be? Almaz-2 Take a couple of photos and go back home But without sudden movements - Slowly - That's affirmative Pash! Are you smiling there? I am I'm taking pictures Time is short, take the photos and go back, Lyosh Oh, wait What's this? What's with the pressure? What's with the pressure? Almaz-2, are you ok? Almaz, what's going on there? Almaz-2 is not replying There was a knock on the spaceship hull Visual contact with Almaz-2 was lost What's with the connection? - All devices work well Technically, the connection isn't broken - What are his parameters? - Pressure, pulse, temperature... All are rising Almaz, continue calling Almaz-2 Repeat, Almaz, continue calling Almaz-2 Everything went too well, too seamlessly Stop all on-air broadcasts - Yes, sir "We are presenting to the audience the ballet of Sergey Sergeyevich Prokofiev "The Tale of the Stone Flower" "On the stage of the state academic Bolshoi theater... " We'll wait Almaz-2, do you read me, over? Almaz-2, over? Zarya, cannot connect with Almaz-2 Continue trying Sergey Pavlovich There are certain instructions for this situation If Almaz-2 cannot get back to the ship We have to get ready to blow-off the airlock Pressure 155 over 100 Pulse 150, temperature 101 F Zarya, this is Almaz Permission to go out to the airlock? How long to the dead zone? It's about 5 minutes until conection is lost - Sergey Pavlovich, the exit of the second cosmonaut means... The full depressurizing of the ship - And they will have to come back by themselves There won't be any connection - And how will the ship behave after the depressurization Only God knows - Start praying then - Sergey Pavlovich If we blow-off the airlock, only one cosmonaut will die If you give the order, both could die Almaz, get ready for depressurizing the ship Copy, Zarya 2 minutes. Standby If Belyaev cannot do it, the results of the colossal work Of thousands Soviet citizens will stay in orbit - Now I think not about thousands, but about two Zarya, this is Almaz I'm ready to go to the airlock Waiting for the order We don't have any right to fail the whole space program For one man One minute until the dead zone Cancel the command, Sergey Pavlovich What are the parameters of Almaz-2 Pressure 170 over 110, pulse 165 Temperature 102 F Alive He's alive Got it? Zarya, this is Almaz, repeat, ready to go out to the airlock Waiting for the order I'm sure you know what you're doing 30 seconds until entering the dead zone Zarya, repeat, waiting for the command Start depressurizing the ship 15 There he is! Almaz-2. Next to the airlock! Zarya, confirming! Almaz-2 is next to the airlock Almaz-2! Run off home! They are in the dead zone What happened? - The spacesuit is inflating Arms, legs, fingers... I can hardly move Why were you silent? - Didn't want to bother you all I see Ok So, how much oxygen do I have? A tad Lyosha, hurry up Lyosha, there's no time at all Take the camera and get into the ship Ok, ok... Taking the camera, Pash Go, go Well done Go it, try That's the only way Come on! What a mess Try, try! Brace yourself! Stop! Belay! Don't you dare! Only feet foremost! Close Close! I said close! Do it! It hasn't closed, right? No I see So, I have to turn around and close it manually That won't work, Lyosha But what are the other options? I'll open the hatch Pull you up - And depressurize the ship - So, we'll take the risk What? To risk the whole operation? No, Pasha I'll try Lyosha! Lyosha, no! Lyosha! Stop! You only had a tiny bit of air Now you won't have anything at all So, you can blow me off together with the airlock You're bull-headed! Damn I got stuck I can't move Lyosh, talk less, save air Ok, I'm silent And what if we put... The leg Like this! Go, go! Come on, Lyosha Go, go, go Yes! The airlock is pressure-tight! Well done! Now hold on Hold on a couple of minutes at the least Lyosha Lyosha, no! - That's all - What? My race is over Good job, Lyosh Ok, I see, but can you tell us? I understand, but what does it mean? Okay Thanks Well, they say that the flight is going in normal mode Lyosha always answers like that, when someone disturbs him from work. Or... Or when everything is bad The demonstrations were held in honor of the flight in Moscow and Leningrad Svetlana Leonova called - Tea? - No, thank you She asked what's what. She's worried Why is she worried? Anything happen? No Voskhod 2 is going to escape the dead zone in a minute Start calling Lyosha? Lyosha, come back to Earth Almaz-2 We are escaping the dead zone Hey, I was thinking Next time - When we fly to the Moon... Command Center is on the line We’ll be getting a scolding now Almaz, this is Zarya, do you read me? Zarya, this is Almaz, reading you loud and clear Almaz, what is with Almaz-2? Zarya, Almaz-2 reads you loud and clear too What a rascal Almaz-2 Welcome back Thank you for your servce Thank you Proud to serve to the Soviet... Why didn't you get in touch? Zarya, we had some problems with the connection We couldn't establish the reason why - Almaz-2... You can't answer for yourself? I confirm Zarya, everything is alright here We are ready to blow-off the airlock - Get ready To blow-off the airlock Getting ready to blow-off the airlock Almaz's, we need to remind you, that we implemented the test cycle Only until this stage We don't know what can happen after blowing off the airlock Be ready for everything It can't get any worse Almaz, check the pressure in the cabin - The pressure in the cabin is normal Check the contact of the igniters - There is contact, ready to blow-off the airlock Blow-off Zarya, the blow-off is complete Depressurizing or other faults are not observed But it spun How much has it spun? Almaz? Approximately... 20 degrees on the contour We can turn on the auto-orientation, it will stabilize And burn all the fuel intended for a manual landing? Sergey Pavlovich, I can put my neck on the line for the automation The manual landing won't be needed Almaz's, how do you feel? We feel good, Zarya So... Let's go for a spin? It's 15 orbits before entering the landing zone It's about 22 hours What do you think, will you endure it? We will, Zarya Hold on, Eagles Hold on 22 hours It's like going to Tuapse In the upper berth The 20th hour of the flight. 2 hours to run the cicle of the automatic landing Hey, it's been long time, you need to sleep. There are 10 orbits ahead It will keep! I need to finish the drawing Tretyakov Gallery is waiting - Tretyakov Gallery? - And what did you think? The first picture made in space That isn't a drawing flowers in pots They will hang it right next to "Morning in a Pine Forest" Do you know, how they called me to go to the art Academy? They kept the place until the last moment - Why didn't you go? - What's the point? You can fly and paint But paint and fly... It's unlikely Well... What's about me, they called me to visit Cuba - You? - Yep You know, they called right from the embassy to the ship Congratulated... "Come here," they say, "Pavel Ivanovich, for holidays." - Ah... But where was I? - I don't know, you went somewhere - Right Brezhnev congratulated me at the same time He said, he will come to the airport to meet me "Lyosh," he said, "Just when you descend the ladder, to the left..." "You'll recognize me, by my hat..." Then to go to the country Not, to the Kremlin first. Then to the country I wish you would draw instead, Lyosh Lyosh Lyosh! How do you feel? Normal? Yeah, just a little bit queasy But it should be that way - What's with the oxygen? - One moment No way Almost 300 Call Zarya, this is Almaz The partial pressure is twice above normal here - What's the exact value? 296.. And still rising Almaz's No sudden movements There is not air, but pure oxygen The littlest spark and you'll burn instantly Copy What to do? Turn off the main lighting Stand by for instructions Copy Where is the oxygen from? They'll find out - There is a leak somewhere... - From the backpacks? Leonov left his in the airlock... So, it's Belyaev's? And the value is 296 at once? Because of just one backpack? Then it's from one of the compensation leakage tank But there are not any failures in the system Tightness of the cabin isn't damaged either Maybe the hatch shifted away during the blow-off? But then we would see a drastic temperature drop Comrades, their pulse and pressure are decreasing It will be oxygen toxicity soon We need a blueprint of the central ceiling zone The most detailed Almaz, most likely there is a micro fissure It's useless trying to search it, it's not dangerous by itself But the system has detected the leak and automatically started pumping air The compensation detector can only be turned off manually You'll have to disassemble something That's affirmative Sergey Pavlovich! We must not do it! Everything is under voltage there - Do you have any other options? Almaz Right above you, at the central ceiling zone The compensation leakage detector is set next to the flap for dropping pressure Cut the upholstery on the contour This is a gamble... Remember... During assemblage, the technician died. But he was a qualified specialist Do you see the density of wiring, and the have no tools and no light My God Zarya, we've cut the upholstery The detector system is set behind the wires To get to it, you need to cut the binding holding the wires Copy, Zarya Lyosh, shine it here What will happen with them? Numbness of the limbs at the beginning Painful muscle spasms All these amid a background of partial hearing loss and visual hallucinations Stop! Easy... Easy... Hold on, hold on... Easy... Carefully Let me do it And you'll shine the light Then they will fall asleep At the end Fall asleep? That's all? Exactly That's all Almaz I'll do it Almaz, do you hear me? Hold on Hold on, Pash Almaz Do do you hear me? Almaz Almaz, do you hear me? Pasha, you're shining the light so well Evenly So bright Good That's good Ah, Zarya I see See I see the detector Well done, now the most important... Do you see a yellow wire? Unplug it. It's behind the nest of wires Nest of wires Do you hear me? Zarya, repeat Behind the nest of wires Repeat, Zarya Unplug the yellow.. Behind the nest of wires Ah... The nest That's where it lives - I didn't get you, Almaz That's where it sleeps. That's her house - What house? I didn't get you, Almaz, repeat We'll unplug it - Did you unplug? Where is your house? Have you unplugged it? Almaz? Ok, I've found Hold on, Pasha Almaz Almaz, do you hear me? Have you unplugged it? Don't be silent, speak! Have you unplugged it? Almaz? Almaz, Almaz... There is no signal. The ship is out of the field of vision The system of automatic orientation... Will run before escaping the dead zone Cycle 4 will land them Do they have a chance? - Mama? - Yes? Is it night in space too? It is Go to sleep Is daddy sleeping too? Sure Everyone should sleep When I wake up... Will daddy fly back? He will try He will really really try 22nd hour of the flight. 25 minutes past the cycle automatic landing run We've been waiting for the signal, but it's silence yet There is no visual contact too Disgusting A crowd of strong healthy men sitting like couch potatos And sighing like it's a funeral If we cannot help our comrades Let's not hold a premature funeral Ma'am Please, coffee fro everybody. And me too Look, let's think logically The ship should have land 23 minutes ago Perhaps during the re-entry the atmosphere it was off course And it ended up at an unplanned area - You're repeating yourself, Boris Viktorovich "Probably, perhaps, it seems..." Give me the calculations for all landing possibilities - Sure Prepare the calculations - We can't wait anymore Let's send aircrafts to search from the air Sergey Pavlovich, there is a call from Kremlin. They want to congratulate the successful... - They will call back - Yes, sir Their parameters! They are alive They are alive We are receiving from the ship Signal, there is a signal This is Almaz, over - Tell them, Korolyov left to meet the cosmonauts Almaz We read you We are you? We are you, Eagles? In the seats We didn't go anywhere - Zarya, this is Almaz We feel normal Cycle 4 hasn't been run Repeat, cycle 4 hasn't been run Just escaping the dead zone Sergey Pavlovich, I... I don't have an explanation yet Perhaps, the spin of the ship was too strong That's an extraordinary situation Oh, is it really? It's not the first Did anyone count them? - I did Let's try to restart the system And land them on in the next orbit We don't have right to land them in the next orbit The ship will be passing rival territory The guys should be returned to Earth And you will be dealing with the territory later Zarya, this is Almaz Permission to switch the ship to manual control immediately And implement the landing right now, over Almaz, we need to calculate the landing point for that We don't have enough time for that now Sergey Pavlovich! Don't worry! We have all calculations So, I guesstimated here... We'll land in the Urals. Somewhere in the Perm area Lyosha! Be reasonable. Is that calculations? "He guesstimated," "Somewhere in the Perm area." On the other hand, they both are experienced pilots - But nobody ever landed a spaceship in a manual mode Manual control, it's like, I don't know... A straw for a drowning Exclusively only for desperate situations And what is the situation now? Sergey Pavlovich For a minute That's it The meeting has begun Now they will gather everyone Choose the Chairman Then they will listen to a speaker Start the discussion And you asked me why I didn't reply? I would be pushing up daisies by now Come on, we will land our clunker, Pash We landed a lot more rustbackets in our day You will land it, won't you? - We don't have any other option - Why that? Or we land it manually now, or they will keep us in the orbit In short, as Motherland will say You think they won't permit it? I wouldn't We are not sisters of mercy, Sergey Pavlovich State secrets are not subjects for experiments - Honestly, I don't get you Or I do, but that's even worse Are you offering to keep them in orbit? Do I get you right? - We are at war Cold, but quite real What if they end up in Europe? Or, God forbid, fly into China All the secrets of our space program will fall into the hands of the enemy - So what? Should they just stay like that? So that they won't "fly into somewhere"? - They are soldiers And the soldiers have to die. In the interest of their state - I see Ok, well... The thought isn't new, but... Constructive. Thanks. Thanks. Maybe, I'll think about it Almaz This is Zarya Switching to manual control... Is permitted Start with sealing the spacesuits "Zarya", copy that Get started It's good that you're not the one who decides "Zarya", repeat, landing area is approximately... Lyosha, they can't hear you They'll find us somehow. If we land Let's land right on Red Square? Enough talk, start stabilization of the spaceship It seems we've aligned You see! You can when you want All we need now is to make it to Earth Lyosh I'm crammed in And how... How am I supposed to see? Maybe I should go out? Direct it I'm ready! West - Done South-west North - No, no! North-west - North or north-west? - Easy, easy, easy... Clockwise Okay, gently. Even more gently Yes, now west - Done Too much! Back it up! Stop! Stop! All over again! Ready West West! - Pasha, we're losing time - That won't work, Lyosh I'll do it myself - What are you doing? The gravity center will shift - Free the seat So where should I go? Go there, under the porthole I'll try Ok, hold my legs - I'm holding Lyosha, I'll take aim And we'll very carefully Quiet as little mice Sit back - Do it quick, buddy. Otherwise we'll land in China - Don't rush me. If I slip up, we'll fly into space Easy Back to the seats Is the Earth steady? It's drifting - How much? - About 7 degrees already - What's with the nitrogen? Almost at zero Lyosha, are you attached? Yep Retro engine run has been detected It'd be great to know where they will end up We'll end up in jail, if anything But they will land The telemetry detected some inclination It seems, they left their seats to take aim And when they were sitting back, the gravity center shifted - So what? The landing path can change - Sergey Pavlovich, can I? With the inclination over six or seven degrees They will get into the atmosphere With a very acute angle The spaceship might ricochet off And get back to the orbit again The gravity will pull them back... - But that won't be soon Boris Viktorovich, calculate all possible landing positions Stay focused Let's wait The transmitter signal And hope... For the best Is it Thursday? Or Friday? I have no idea You think the children have got up? I wonder if Vika went to the daycare or again... Lyosha, don't worry If I slipped up, then in about three years... The gravity will work anyway Be buried with honors So... Let's have a bite to eat Hoo oo! How about that! What delicacies! Borscht It's a pity there's no garlic Do you want some? Lyosha! You are... Seems like gravity Belay the delicacies! Going home! That's affirmative, comrade commander! Blow-off reserve retro engine Separation confirmed Get ready for instrument module separation. Blow-off! Partial, the module hasn't been separated Lyosh, hold on! It's going to spin Okay! It came apart! Alive? Pash? Yes, I am! - You fool! - Were you scared? - Why'd you do that? - Done? - Yeah Let's go? Ready? It will be loud Wait a sec - So ya ready? - Yep 3 hours after the moment of landing "We are at square 24, no signal" "Square 22, still nothing" "...in the whole shortwave range, no signal. Continue searching" Why, with all the power of Soviet science, We cannot detect one radio beacon In a given square! The signal disappeared during re-entry into the atmosphere. It can mean... It can't We need specific versions Sergey Pavlovich Apparently, they landed somewhere we didn't expect A full-scaled search operation has been deployed You need cool it And get some rest - I'll get rest when we've found them What are the assumptions? First, the beacon might be broken from a hard landing Second, they might have damaged it when they were cutting the upholstery - They have a portable transmitter for that case To send signals manually So why can't we detect it? The batteries of the transmitter don't work at low temperature - So what? It wouldn't dawn upon them how to warm a battery? - First they have to work out how to warm themselves The spacesuits, unplugged from the life support system, are not designed for low temperature - They cannot shelter in the capsule as well. It will be like a freezer in an hour Perhaps, the radio waves just cannot pass The quality of a shortwave signal depends a lot on a terrain and weather conditions - Let's say they turned out to be in adverse weather conditions How long can they hold out? A day Taiga. It's turning off the signal But we will use Morse code We'll make it with good old Morse code Morse code is very reliable You'd better winterize, Alexey - It will keep V-N V-N, V-N... What's "V-N"? V-N, "Everything normal" Do you have a conscience? They've landed, our eagles! V-N! - What? - It's V-N. "Everything normal" - So you're "everything normal"? - Hey, wait! It will be the most interesting moment now... ... Rescue operation - Don't worry, they will rescue them without you They will show everything on TV tomorrow - Ahh, why do you always... - Go, go.. Enough to intervene in state secrets The Kremlin ...is waiting an official statement We have to do it tomorrow by 10 am We have nothing to make yet Sergey Pavlovich, you need to get some rest Nothing depends on you now There is a plenty of time until the morning, if we don't waste it Comrade lieutenant general! Permission to speak... The weather report has come. Heavy snowfall is expected all over the Ural ridge An Arctic cyclone is moving there The temperature will fall to -31 F at night - At night But it's still day now, right? It's still day 6 hours after the moment of landing If they have got the signal, it's about two hours for triangulation... So they are going to come soon They'll be soon If they got it Here Your turn Chill out We knew what we were getting into If they find the journal, Consider, the task is completed What do you mean completed? Did you forget about your girls? They are ironing your uniform. Preparing to meet their dad alive You understand? Alive Not a frozen piece of mammoth shit No, buddy Give me a hand No! My family won't forgive me for this Who will take Vika to school for the first time? So here it is, comrade Belyaev There wasn't an order to give up Don't get bored, I'll be back soon Alright Pass the order Put everything into the air that flies Double the search area Yes, sir General Kamanin's order... Send the text for the record of the message Which one, Nikolay Petrovich? Both variants Good evening, comrades "death of the crew" May I have some water? I'm ready "Ready" March 18th 1965 In the Soviet Union, for the purpose of testing, The Voskhod 2 spacecraft was sent to the orbit of Earth planet It was manned by two pilots and cosmonauts of the USSR Lieutenant Colonel Pavel Ivanovich Belyaev And Major Alexey Arkhipovich Leonov During the test flight, which lasted more than a day... During the landing, the ropes of the parachute twisted And the spaceship continued falling with a high speed Which was the cause of Death of the crew Are you guys off your rocker? You kidding us? Hey! Where are you? Ain't you got no brains? We are alive here! Hey! We're alive Are you deaf or what? Hey! We're alive Hey, we're alive "...Untimely death" Of the remarkable researchers and cosmonauts Pavel Ivanovich Belyaev And Alexey Arkhipovich Leonov Is a heavy and irreparable loss For the whole of the Soviet people They have been awarded the title of Heroes of Soviet Union Posthumously Pasha Pasha Pasha Are you ok? Don't sleep! Hey, Pash Pash Don't think of sleep! Don't sleep! Pash That's it, Lyosh Pavel Ivanovich Alright Do you know what we're going to do now? We will rehearse the speech for the reporters - Because you're always standing like a... - You'll handle it by yourself You're a hero now - Am I? Nah You were a hero when I just helped to farm cows And you'd already been to war How many battle flights did you already have! And I was only dreaming about the sky - One One what? One flight And I didn't even shoot The older guys fought, and we, younger guys, prepared the planes Swept the aerodrome And finally, they gave me a battle flight I thought, here is my turn! Maybe I'll be useful for something The enemy didn't attack us We flew and returned to the base As if we didn't even fly And on the next day they capitulated Well, here's your "hero" Pavel Belyaev Do you know... Why I went to flight school? - Why? - The allowance was bigger than in the art Academy Right now I would be painting my pictures living on easy street But no. The whole world saw how I dangled from the tether It was inflated so much, I almost shit my spacesuit Here is a conqueror of space Alexey Leonov Pashka, forgive me That I got you into this No, no That's good What's good? It's good that You didn't become an artist Otherwise, who else would I fly with so well Maybe we'll fly again Depends on what Motherland will say What the Motherland will say They've landed Successfully Asking for help But nobody's coming to them But they will come for you, and you'll go to jail Very successful But I won't have anyone to ask for help But how else? 9 hours from the moment of landing The weather turned bad I have to pause the search operation I see... As soon as the storm stops... - Yes, yes... Of course We have to inform... The families Sergey Pavlovich, maybe... We shouldn't hurry? But what do you want? Do you want them to hear about it from the radio announcer? We've got the signal! Sergey Pavlovich, it seems... We've got the signal - What you mean, "it seems..." - I'm sorry, comrade lieutenant general There was a call from the Committee Some radio fan from Sakhalin got in touch with them He says, he accidentally got a signal from the cosmonauts Accidentally? How's that an accident? - Accidentally... Radio fan... Sakhalin... Which square? According the triangulation it turns out... square 62nd - Do we have anyone at the 62nd? Yes, we have one helicopter within a mile from there - Call - Call him Craft '216'! The signal from the cosmonauts was located at the 62nd square You are the closest. Try to gain visual contact Repeat, try to gain visual contact This is '216' I'm at square 62 The meteorological conditions are bad - Continue the search while they can - Yes, sir You hear? You hear? That's for us They've found us Where? The flare gun Pash Where's the flare gun? Did I lose it? Uh? Klutz Commander, the tanks are almost dry We should get back, or we might not make it to the base This is '216', the fuel is almost out here They have to get back - Let them get back - Yes, sir '216', return to base '216' This is Korolyov Sergey What's your name? Major Markelov And by your first name? Vladimir Volodya, listen to me Somewhere on the trees there There must be a chute It's really big Noticeable Please, look closely It's hard not to notice it Do you hear me? That's affirmative What's the... Where did I put it, ah? Why all half-assed Come on, help Lyosh, help, it froze Pashka! Here you go, man Hold on... We have emergency fuel. We must go Lyosha, give a signal. Can't see anything Hold on, Pashka You're the man Wait... I'll help you Hold on Commander! We must leave, or we won't make it to the base This is '216' We can't see the chute There is no a signal from the cosmonauts We tried We are sorry - Can't bend my fingers - Come on, do it slowly Pasha, do it slowly Come on... Come on - I can't '216', return to base That's affirmative, going back This is '216'! A flare! Signal flare! - Send the rescue team '216', we're copying the exact coordinates 20 miles south-east of Bereznyaky town The coordinates: 56 degrees, 37 hours... Thank you Volodya Can I get something? Sure, Sergey Pavlovich Chkalovsky aerodrome. Moscow Oblast. The third day after the launch Daddy! Dad! Lyoshka! What are you doing, kid? Where did you go in the middle of the night? She sleeps anywhere Who? The bird That's good for you! Weren't you scared? Your heart is beating fast - Did you run around? - No, dad, I didn't run I flew "This is Moscow broadcast."
