[cheerful music] [bell ringing] - Hi. - Hi, Mrs. Marsh. - Ooh. - [Boy] I'm gonna miss the show. - Okay. We're coming right back. - No. - I promise. Up here. Drew left his good shoes at home. They won't let him sing in his sneakers. - I can sing in my sneakers. - Yes, you can, honey. I know that. You're coming in with me. - No, I'm not. - Well, hey, Mr. Richard. How are you? Good to see you. Welcome, welcome. - Dad. Have you seen Mom? - I suppose she's around here somewhere. Hey, how are you? Skeeter, how you feeling, boy? Good to see you. Hey, you're gonna have to change those shoes of yours, you know. And that hair gets cut first thing Saturday morning. - Yes, sir. - Well, hey, good to see you. [busy music] - [Mrs. Marsh] I know, I know. I know it's a terrible - No! - statement on the world. - No. - I don't want you growing up afraid. I really don't, but I can't leave you out here alone. Come on. You're coming inside. Come on. Ugh. Woo. Come on. Woo. Woo hoo. Hey, Twister, good boy. [Twister barking] Drew said he left his shoes in the closet, Willie. Oh! [Willie laughs] - Elliot, trade places with Mr. Smarty Feet there. [audience applauding] - Three small lights bobbed with the swell of the waves, lanterns, each hung on the stern- - [Mrs. Marsh] Ann Marie. - Oh, it just started. - Would you give those to Drew? - Yeah, no problem. - Thank you. - So they could go far west in the great Atlantic, an ocean of dragons and whirlpools, most people believed at the time. Brave sailors, Columbus and his men. Yes, they brought tragedies to the land they found, disease and death and slavery, ugly truths, which sometimes we find hard to balance against the gratefulness that we feel living in this wonderful country and in this wonderful town with our pelicans and our flamingos. [some children chuckle] For the better, I think, those ships and those men have brought us here together today. And I thank Mr. Columbus for that. [audience applauding] And now I give you the Palm Key Orchestra and Glee Club. ♪ O beautiful for spacious skies ♪ ♪ For amber waves - The mayor wants a few words. - Okay. - I won't be long. ♪ Waves of grain ♪ For purple mountains majesties ♪ ♪ Above the fruited plain - [Mrs. Marsh] Mandy, I gotta tell you it was thrilling. - Was I really good? - Absolutely terrific. George. - Wonderful. - You weren't even there. - Well, of course I was. You think I'd miss my princess' first a solo? - Waa dang! - [Mandy] Willie, stop. - Hey, Drew. - Hey, Julie. - Sit up. - So how about your dad? Was that a great speech? - Not bad. - Lin, you're not eating. - You know my thing about sausage. - Why didn't you say something? - Oh, I'll just pick it off. - [Mandy] Hey, Drew! - [Drew] Come on. [laughing] - Ooh, did you call the roofer? - Sid says we can't afford it. We gotta put more money in the IRA. - Yeah, well, Sid won't be here when we all float away to Cuba. - All right, big boy. - Five minutes. - [Drew] I'm in the shower. - [Linda] Good night, sweetheart. Sweet dreams. - Nora Clutter said Daddy and Miss Scott like each other. - Miss Scott, your teacher? Sweetheart, your Daddy likes all his teachers. That's his job. - Happy anniversary. Open it. - Oh, it's beautiful. - All the girls are wearing them. - It's not too revealing? - It's extreme. Daddy'll love it too. - Hmm. I wonder how he'll look in this shade of pink. [both laugh] I love you. - Love you too, Mom. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Ooh! [both giggle] Night. - Night. - [whistles] Yoo-hoo. What do you think? Mandy gave it to me. - Wow. You look like a kid. - Excuse me, Mr. Marsh, do you have any homework for me? Go on, Twister. Happy 16th. - Well, not much of a celebration. - Well, it doesn't have to stop here. Why don't we drive up to Silver Springs, their honeymoon hotel? Get mom to stay with the kids. - That place has probably fallen into the gulf by now. - Well then why don't we go out to that little roadside park on Interstate 98? It'd only take a half hour to get there. - Oh, we used to be so damn sexy. Now it's all about the kids and the job and the roof. What happened, babe? One minute you're young, there's nothing you can't do. - Come on, George. We got a good life, great kids, our own home. Even the crab grass is under control. And we've got each other. - I had such dreams for us. What did I deliver? Principal at a high school out in the sticks, the usual mortgage, pile of credit card debt. - You're an inspiration to every child at that school. Every month, some graduate stops by. You've touched hundreds of people, George. This little life, this family, is my dream. - You're so easy to please. - [Linda] Yes, I am. [both moaning] - Are you sure about that crab grass? - [giggles] Oh, George. George! [George chuckles] Morning. - [George] Hey. - [Linda] Your dad now are going out tonight. I want you home by six. - I'll call you later. - I'm gonna throw up. - Well, you just wait. You just wait until you fall in love. - Hey, Mom, Mom, stop! Mom, gosh. [horn honking] - Bus is here. - Hey, Tisha. Hi, everybody. - Oh, hi, honey. - Oh, I'm sorry I'm late. - No problem, darling. - Oh, Dottie, do your stuff. - Anniversary again, huh? - Look what I did. [Dottie gasps] Can you believe it? - Oh, sweetie, can his heart take it? Oh! - Excuse me, is the principal in? - Goodness, Linda. [Linda laughing] It may not be at good time. Let me tell him you're here. He's in with the mayor. [George murmuring] - [Ann Marie] George. [George chuckles] - Oh, excuse me. - Linda. Oh, you're early. If I'd known you were coming early, I would have put Ann Marie off. We were working on her grant proposal for her master's research. It's about, it's all about computers in the classroom. Have they, you know, really made a difference. It's incredible stuff. - And then he lied to me. Or maybe he's been lying to me for years. - Lied to you? Lied to you about what? - I caught you George, red handed, with Mandy's teacher. - Caught me doing what? I'm not gonna tell you that I don't like her. She's a, she's a terrific girl. - George. George. George. - Oh, God. What am I doing? I'm risking everything. I'm risking you. My family, my job. What am I doing? I need help, Linda. - Now you want sympathy? - I tried to end it. It's like I'm addicted. - No, I can't listen to this, George. I am the injured party here. I just walked through that door and got my heart broken. George! You've hurt me! - Okay, come here. Look, it'll be all right. - How? When? What, what'll I do till then? How did you make love to me? - Because I still do love you. - Well then you gotta make a choice. That's what marriage is all about. Nobody said you weren't gonna be attracted to 24-year-old teacher Barbie. - Just gimme some time on my own. [somber music] - I think I'm gonna be sick. Oh, my god. - I'll work it out. Linda. [Linda sobbing] - Are you a all right, Mrs. Marsh? - Oh. Sure, sweetheart, I'm fine. I just, I just got something in my eye. Go on. Don't worry about me. Go on. [Linda sobbing] Your father and I have something to tell you. - What? That he's boinking Miss Scott? The whole school's talking about it. - Sweetheart. - Listen to me. I love your mother, and I love each and every one of you very much, no matter what anybody says, never doubt that. Now, we have to be strong, but it is the best thing if I move out for a while. - What? You really are a jerk! - [Linda] Drew. - God! - Now, this is gonna be hard on all of us. I know that, but I want us to stay together as a family. - That'll be a neat trick. - No, we can do it. I know that, if we try. Right, princess, huh? I'll just be down the street. A couple of months, this will be behind us. Don't give up on us now. Come here, big boy. Ooh. Mwah. - Dad. Do I still get my allowance? - The important things never change, do they, Drew? Here you go. - No! - No, go on, go back to Mom. I'm not going far. - Come here. [melancholy music] [Twister whines] - Can't take you with me to this trip, pal. - What is this all about? Where are we? - Hold it, hold it. Hold it right here. Hold it, hold it. [Linda laughing] One second. Welcome home. - You bought it? - Well, you said you wanted a bungalow by the sea, feeding barefoot babies and me. [Linda screams] Well, it's kind of small. It's nothing special. - Oh, no, George, it is. It's very special. All we have to do is paint the shutters and the trim and put in some shrubs and a couple of carriage lamps. Woo! I can see it right now all covered with white Christmas lights. - Well, I like the colored ones. - Colored Christmas lights. [Linda whooping] [melancholy music] He'd always say [Both] Linda, don't go to the bar. - [Linda] I couldn't help it. - I just can't believe how together you are. - George and I, you know, we've been married for about, how many, 16 years, and we've got three kids. We got a life together. This is not gonna last. He's coming back. He calls me every day. [upbeat country music] - And how long did he tell you it's been going on? - Six months. - Six months, really? He lied. It's been six months since I bet Sid you would throw him out. - You knew about this? - Oh, honey, come on, it's a small town. I know what Ronnie Law's had for breakfast, the protein count of Ed Scully's last urine test, how much Ella McKee's got left in her will. Come on, Lin, you knew it too. You just didn't wanna admit it. Yeah, you did. - Woo! [rock music] Wow, what is this stuff? - Wine. Why don't I take you home? - Woo! Yes! [people clapping] - No. Oh, man. - No. Come on. - No, no, no. - My ball. - I've had enough humiliation for one night. - Oh no, come on, chicken, I'm just hitting my stride. - I think I could stand little humiliating. - Well, you can or you can't. [man laughs] - You're on, girl. I'm Charlie Pick. - Charlie Pick, the roofing guy? - Yup. Accept no substitutes. - I've been trying to reach you for weeks. I'm Linda Marsh. - Oh, yeah. Well, I tell you what, Ms. Marsh, if you win, I'll do your job for free. - And if you win? - Well, I guess I can take being humiliated after all. [rock music] Right, right. Where's the cue ball? Come here. Ugh. I think what you need is another drink. - [Linda] Yeah, yeah, me too. - Down here. Try it. You can't get. Go ahead, between 'em. - I gotta go. - Hey! Linda Marsh! - [Man] Oop, excuse me. - Darling. - I'm falling, Lucille. I feel like the ground is slipping out from underneath me. - I know. I know. It'll get easier. - He's not coming back. - No, baby. No baby, he's not. [Linda crying] Come on. Come on. Let me take you home. - Okay. - Come on. [sad music] - [Narrator On TV] After careful observation, soon they will all be returned to the wild, to their natural habitat. Still, they will be missed. - George. - [Narrator On TV] Late in 1993, the scientists will set out, determined to go beyond the point of original observation. - Where the hell have you been? - What's that supposed to mean? - Well, your children didn't have a clue where you were. - Oh yes, they did. They knew exactly where I was. I was at Fanny's. - Tell that to Willie. He needed you. And where were you? You were at Fanny's, getting sloshed. If you have any interest in keeping this marriage together, I suggest that you pull yourself together. - Wait a minute, George. I'm not the problem here. Remember? - Problems in a marriage happen because of two people. I think I've accepted more than my share of the guilt. And if you can't handle it alone with the kids, I'll take them. - Is that a threat? - No, Linda, concern. - I see. My husband, the adulterer thinks I'm an unfit mother? - That's right, Linda, go with the digs instead of facing the real issue. We are not putting the kids at risk. - I have been with those kids every minute since you left them, drying their tears, talking them through the nightmares. You didn't even show up last Saturday! - Just keep the partying into a minimum. Don't even think about bringing strange men into the house. - Ha! George, what is it? What cheap, selfish whim of yours haven't I given into now? [Linda sighs] - I'm sorry, Mom. Willie wanted him, and he wouldn't come. So I lied, and I told didn't know where you were. I'm sorry. - Please, honey, next time there's a problem, call me. - Mom. There's a problem. [gentle music] [Linda laughs] - [Linda] Here you go, mister. - Well, hello. - Hi. - I bought it for him for Halloween. - Oh, well, maybe he's just trying to get a jump on it. I wouldn't worry about it too much. I'm sure it's just on account of George leaving. - Yeah, well that's what the psychologist says. He'll be over it in about a year or two. Willie, stay away from that garden! - My but don't you look nice today. - Oh, thank you, Sidney. Got a job interview. [Lucille gasps] - Oh, great, great. - County job, administrative assistant. No big deal. - Great. - But it's a start. - Oh, good for you! - [Linda] Lucille, I've had it with falling apart. - [Lucille] Well, all right. - [Sid] Knock 'em dead, now. - You look great. Good luck. - Okay. Oh, by the way, where's Park Highway? - Park Highway? Oh, that's out by the dump. - [Worker] All right, bring her in nice and slow now. Pass her down! - [Man] Hi there. - Hi. - I don't mind telling you, I'm a little heavy on organization. So if I seem particular at first, you'll soon see that it pays to do things right the first time. [animals squeaking] Oh, you just stomp your foot a couple of times, they'll run off. Rats aren't nearly as aggressive as people. - [laughs] I'm sorry. It's not funny, not at all. - You know, little lady, there is a world of opportunity here. Little as I might like to think about it, I'm only 12 years this side of handing over the reins. I'm gonna tell you straight right now. You don't have the drive or the maturity, let alone the experience for the job. - I can't get a job at the county dump? - That's right, no, ma'am. - Uh huh. [melancholy music] [water dripping] [dog whines] - Read. - All right. Find another one. - This one. - Do I have to? - Okay. Let me move your ear. "Rose Meets Mr. Wintergarden." The morning the Summers family moved into their new house, they felt at home. Faith and Rose put up their pictures. Baby Blossom watched. Mr. and Mrs Summers planted pansies, petunias and daisies. Their garden was a carpet of flowers, all before the sun went down. Every morning from the roof of their house, the Summerses watched the sun come up. - Why don't we do that? - Because we'd fall off. No, it's just a story. - It's not real? - No, honey, it's not real. [melancholy music] George! George! Oh, George. George, I'm pregnant. [Linda giggling] George, George. - [George] Ugh, I love you. [laughing] I love you, I love you, I love you. I love you, I love you, I love you. I love you, love you, I love you! - You all know Amanda Marsh. She'll be in our class now. [kids giggling] Now that's enough of that. I want you to make her feel welcome. Go right over there. - [Children] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America And to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible. - We both know why you did this. You're trying to get back at me. That's fine. I understand. I probably deserve it, but I will not allow you to disgrace this institution. - Don't worry, you already got that one covered. - All right, that's it. I'm tired of making exceptions. We'll go by the book on this one. A month of detentions. - Whoa, heavy stuff. - And no learner's permit. - I'm sure my mom mailed it in. She always pays on time. Yes, sir. I will, sir. - I'm sick of your spaghetti. - Yeah, well, I'm sick of you complaining. Make it yourself. - Y'all bring your plates upstairs. "Gone with the Wind's" coming on. - [scoffs] "Gone with the Wind" is right. - Five minutes till show time. - Give me that thing! - Mommy! - [Mandy] It's filthy! - Mandy! - [Mandy] You're filthy. - [Linda] Mandy, stop it. - Do you want to think he's a rabbit? Well, he's not a rabbit. - He's just having trouble being Willie without Daddy around. - Well, what if he forgets how? - You don't forget how to be yourself. - You have. - Yeah, you can't even get it together to get the roof fixed. - Your dad- - Not everything's Daddy's fault. - Well, as a matter of fact, I have called the roofer. He's a, he's a friend. Hi, Charlie. Hi, this is Linda Marsh, queen of mildew. I was just wondering if you could stop by and gimme that estimate. About the other night, I, I had way too much to drink. And could we just forget about it? Twister! Twister! He took the dog? - George! - [George] Linda, what is the matter? - [Linda] How could you? - Get hold of yourself. - It's not bad enough you gotta, you gotta screw around! You make your kids the butt of every dirty joke in town! How could you take the dog? Don't you think we have feelings? Ugh! Come home, George, please. I need you. I can't do this alone. Please come home. [sad music] - I can't, Linda. I don't love you anymore. I'm in love with Annie. [dog barking] [vacuum whirring] [Linda groans] - Mom? - Breakfast is ready. And what was this doing under sofa? - [Linda] Mandy lost interest. - Well, we'll see you about that. Oh, he was a fool to have left you. You're the closest thing to Martha Stewart he's gonna get. - Her husband left her too. Palm Key residents were shocked to learn that George and Linda Marsh are calling it quits. George- - That's kinda nice. They care, sweetheart. - I don't want their sympathy. I want a new job, a 10-day cruise, a new car, someone to pay my mortgage, and someone to cut off George's- - [Mom] Linda. - And run it up the flag pole outside of city hall. - You know, why don't you take that anger and put it to some use? Turn it into power! - You got it. We gotta want it. I love pony, you love pony, woo! Come on, let's go. Yeah. Yeah. - That's disgusting. - Come on, Cher. We're just talking buns of titanium. I just loved her in the Moonlight movie. - "Moonstruck," Mama. [upbeat music] Mom, I don't need your pep talks, your diets, your exercise programs. - Come on, baby, just punch it out. Get those endorphins moving. Mr. Endorphin, wake up. - Mom, this is not some beauty pageant I just lost. - Oh, honey. I'm sorry things didn't work out for you. What did I know? I just crawled out of some ditch back. You had a talent. You had a beauty. My life was so ordinary. I wanted yours to be extra ordinary. [melancholy music] - This is all I ever wanted. I don't regret loving him. I just regret trusting him. Now, what was this? - We got it. We gotta want it. I love pony, you love pony. Woo! - Oh, I can't take that. - Yes, you can. It's yours. It's money I put away in case you made it to Miss America. - You put away $10,000 for the Miss America pageant? - Well, honey, for your dresses, for your musical arrangements. Those other girls wouldn't have stood a chance. Oh, baby, don't ever stop believing in yourself. You're just as extra ordinary today. - Even with these thighs? - Even with those thighs. - [Both] I love pony, you love pony. - Drew, that white line is there for a reason! - Mom, quit making him nervous. You're doing just fine, Drew. [girls giggling] - And you keep your eyes on the road, mister. - Yes, yes! - [Linda] No, no, no. - And both hands, both hands on the wheel! Stop! [tires squealing] - Oh! - [Linda] Okay now, you just back up real easy. - You learn how to drive! Ugh! - Drew, just give me those keys. - Oh, now, just plan your stop a little bit better next time. - I'm sorry. - All right, the light's green. [horn honking] [car crashes] Oh Lord! - [Linda] Hey, how you doing? - What's that smell? - It's money going up in smoke. - [Man] Everybody all right? - Shoot, I'm sorry, sir. Honest, I forgot it was still in reverse. - How bad do you think it is? - I don't think it's that serious, just the steam makes it look bad. - Um, um, I know you're real upset. This is obviously a fine car. It's obviously real old, and it's worth a lot, at least to you. Oh no, no, it's probably real valuable, and you love it. And my son, he just got his learner's permit. I mean, literally just got it this afternoon, and his father, he- - You married? - Divorced almost. And his father was completely against it. - The divorce? - No, the learner's permit. And do you think that maybe we could just not make too big a deal about this? I mean, this might really blow my son's confidence. I'd really appreciate it. - I don't see why not. - [Reporter] This way, please. - Linda, honey. He's a widower and a doctor. Harvard Medical School. - Mom, let's get one thing straight, if in 40 years I'm ready for a man in my life, I'll get a pen pal. - And he's replacing old Dr. Wright. [cheerful music] 1 2, 3. [Mandy giggling] - Drew, this box seems to have gotten a lot heavier since the last time I moved it. - Amanda, I just heard a story about a baton that just about broke my heart. - I wasn't very good. - Well, neither was your mama when she was your age. She went on to be state champion. - She did? - The other girl in the competition broke her arm. - [chuckles] I have pictures. And she sang like a bird. - I hate when Mommy sings. - And she won most talented in her very first state pageant. And the entire audience rose to its feet. - What did you sing, Mom? - Well, everyone stood up, so it must have been the "Star Spangled Banner." - [Linda] Ha! [phone ringing] - [Charlie] Linda, this is Charlie, Charlie Pick. You know, there's a break in the rain now. I was wondering if you still wanted that roof of yours fixed. - Don't hang up. - Let me know. - Hello? [dial tone humming] Oh, shoot. Let there be light! [family whooping] - Bravo. We did good. - Yes, we did. - [Linda] Oh, it looks like I always wanted it to. - It's just beautiful. Hey. - Hey. - Well, I think it's time I just went and drove your brother crazy for a while. - I love you, Mom. - [Mom] There's Drew, Willie, Mandy. Where are you? - That's always the hardest part. - Oh. [melancholy music] - George. - I know the kids are spending Christmas day with me, but I figure they're used to opening their presents here. - That's very sweet. Come on inside. We'll put 'em under the tree. Come. - Well, the place looks wonderful. - Just needed a little attention. - And you look, you look like the first time I saw you. - George. I'm not proud of some of the things I said or did. And I still have my moments, but I am beginning to accept things the way they are. And [sighs] I think we're gonna be just fine this way. - Great, well, that's great. - You better get on home. - Merry, Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, George. [gentle music] - No way! I got a boom box! - [Mandy] Cool. - [Willie] Whoa! - Just can't play it too loud. - Oh my gosh, Mom. - Yeah. - It's a radio and two cassettes. - It's the right one? - This is perfect.! - Okay. Y'all be careful now, that couch is brand new. - I'm afraid you left the gate open again. - Oh, well, thank you for sharing that with us, Mr. Scrooge. What's the matter with you? Damn. [George sighs] - I thought you'd have this more together. - Like Linda always did? - I'll take 'em to a movie. ♪ Joy to the world ♪ The Lord is come ♪ Let earth receive her king ♪ Let every heart prepare [hand knocking] [Linda humming] - Ho ho ho. - [Linda] Charlie. - [chuckling] I thought I might take a look at that roof for you. - [Linda] On Christmas? - Well, don't worry, no extra charge. Maybe just a glass of egg nog. - So don't you have any family around here? - Nope. Ohio. Cold. That is one beautiful tree you got there. - Oh, well, George and I always disagreed on how much was too much. And I think I went a little overboard this year. - No, I think it's perfect. Merry Christmas, Linda. - Merry Christmas, Charlie. - [Charlie] Come here. [Linda gasps] - Oh, stop. - [Charlie] I'm starved. - Stop it! - Come here. Come on. - [Linda] Slow down. - Just relax. - Lemme just. Slow down, okay? Let me just make another drink. Oh my gosh. - Ugh! God, ugh! - Get out! - Okay, I'm going. - Get out! - Stop hitting! - You creep, get out! - I'm going! I'm going, lady! [sad music] - We'll find him. - I can't prove a thing. It's his word against mine. - Chances are, Linda, he's tried this before, and your word means plenty in this town. - [Police Officer] Here you go, Dan. - Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. They got him, and he's hurting real bad. Nice work. State champion, huh? - Thank God I wasn't a cheerleader. - Maybe you should stay with a friend, just for tonight. - No, George will be bringing the kids back soon. I'll be fine. - We'll be getting outta your way. - What next? The plague? Damn! Drew! - It's Christmas vacation! Don't you know what that means? - Yeah, it means you got five days left to write three dazzling themes on American poetry. Now march. Come on, it's not rocket science, Drew. What's it mean? - I don't know. - Oh, captain, my captain, our fearful trip is done. The ship has weathered every rack. The prize we sought is won. - Sounds like maybe some sailors have to be home. - Yes. Now, read it again and think about this, it's about Abraham Lincoln. - No kidding? - So if the captain is a president during a terrible war? - Oh gosh, Mom, I really get it better when I hear it. Just read it to me. - No, I'm cooking. You do it. Come on. - [sighs] The port is near. The bells I hear. The people all exciting. - Exhausting. - Whatever. - Wal... - Drew, you can't see those words. Oh my God. You need glasses. - Of course I can see it! It's Christmas vacation! I'm not reading some dorky poem during Christmas vacation! - Oh no. - E, P, F. O, T, Z, E, L, P, D, C, E, P, F, D. Happy? - So he does need glasses? - I think it might be a little bit more serious than that. He's confusing certain letters consistently. - I know, I noticed that. - [Doctor] What kind of grades does he get? - Bs. Mostly Cs. - He's awfully bright to be getting mostly Cs. - I know. His father thinks he's lazy, and I always assumed he wasn't book smart. - If I'm right, he's had to fight tooth and nail for those grades. And I hate to tell you this, but I think he's dyslexic. - I know. Oh. Drew, why didn't you say something? I can't believe you held this inside all these years. - Just don't tell dad. Please. He hates me enough already. - Hate you? He doesn't hate you. - He'd have been a lawyer if it wasn't for me. You got pregnant. - He told you that? - He gave everything up for stupid retard! - Drew, look at me. Let me see your eyes. Come on. - God! - First of all, you're gonna be fine. We're gonna take care of this. And secondly, for the record, you were very much planned and wanted and adored. He literally counted the days until you were born. The day I brought you home from the hospital, he planted the entire garden in blue flowers. - Then what happened, Mom? How did he get to be so mean? - It's good to see you two together again. - [Linda] Hi. - But I'm just a hopeless romantic. - Thank you, Mr. Mayor. [gentle piano music] - I thought we were just gonna talk. This isn't exactly what I expected. - Well, I figured we both had a lot on our minds, what with this news about Drew. A night out might do us some good. I know this is a favorite place of yours. To the future, whatever it holds. - Uh huh. - I tell you, Lin, I take full responsibility for not picking up on Drew's dyslexia. I'm gonna get him the best doctors, the best everything. - You really mean that? - I don't care what it costs. I'll find the money. We'll get through this. Together. I have to tell you that the holidays were very tough. - It's a sentimental time. - No, that wasn't it. I missed you. I missed the kids. I miss seeing them, you know, smiling faces there on Christmas Eve. Remember how I used to dress up like Santa Claus? Peeking through the banisters, big old sack of toys on my shoulder. - Here we are. - We'd kiss under the mistletoe. - [Waiter] Oysters. - George. - They always were a favorite of yours, huh? - [Waiter] Excuse me. - Thank you. - [Waiter] Enjoy. - Lin, do you think that maybe there's a chance that we could get back together? - Oh. - Just, just a chance? - There's always a chance, I guess. - That's all I need. I know we got a lot of things to work out. Correction, I've got a lot of things to work out. - [Linda] Starting with Drew. - Absolutely. I'm the first one that wanna make things better. - George, Drew's got this crazy idea that you would've gone to law school if he hadn't come along. - Oh, God. Well, I guess I laid on the scare tactics a little thick. We were having a discussion about girls, the discussion about girls. Now, I preached total abstinence, of course, warned him about the evils of the flesh. I said, "Listen to your old man, as wonderful as they are, kids limit your options." - Like yours were? - Well, yeah, I use myself as an example. I mean, who knows what I would've been if you hadn't rushed me into a family. - Oh my god. You couldn't have said anything worse. Even if it was true. - Honey, I was making a point - That is despicable! - for his benefit. - It's despicable that you would ruin your own son to feed the bottomless pit of an ego of yours. Waiter! Waiter, would you bring this man his check? Just for once, I wish that you would live up to your personal myth of yourself, George the good, the kind, the wise! Get back together with you? No, I... How did I ever love you? [gentle music] Darn. All right. Come on. Ugh! Good riddance. [ring clatters] Bye. Hey there. - Hey. Well, howdy bunny. What's your name? - [Willie] Willie Rabbit. - Willie Rabbit. Let me think now, do rabbits eat lollipops? - Yeah. - Yeah, if they wash their hands first. - [Doctor] There you go. - [Linda] Go ahead. - Oh, I was browsing the net. Got some information on dyslexia. - Oh, let me put these down. - [Doctor] Up to date to the minute. - Great. I signed him up for this reading clinic in Gainesville. - Oh, good. That's good news. - This is incredibly nice of you. - Well, there's a string attached, a favor. Now, you don't have to say yes. - [Linda] It sounds bad. - Oh, it's even worse. New Year's Eve shindig, the chamber of commerce. I'm the newest member. There's no way out. - Ah, no way out for you. - Oh. Come on, have pity. This isn't easy for me. Dating and I are barely on speaking terms. I mean, I try to do it every year, but I'm really slipping. - Well, I'm not dating at all. And I don't plan to till I'm about 100. - All right, well, I'll tell you what. We won't call it a date. All right? Just friends. - Just friends? - Just friends. - Here it is. - Oh, I'll only be there an hour or two. This is a favor, not a date. - It's also a party and not a funeral. - Well, I prefer this one. - Well, it's too old for me, much less you. Now, you put this on. - Oh, I look fine. - You look like you've spent the day collecting fines on overdue books. - Well, I don't want him getting the wrong message. - And what would that be? - That I'm enjoying this. I like being covered up. - Well, maybe we should get a hood and some knee socks. He'll enjoy the gesture. - Oh, frankly, I don't care whether he likes me or not. - Well, honey, they are not all like George. There are plenty good ones running around and alive. And they love girls in red dresses. - I'm too nervous. Why don't you go with him instead? - Oh, nervous is good. Nervous. Now, breathe in. - [Linda] I'm not ready for this. - Oh, nonsense. You look beautiful. - Yeah, if you're going to the Country Music Awards. - [tongue clicks] I'm gonna get my camera. - [Linda] I'll bring you some of those hats and those do-dads. - [Drew] Kazoos. - Kazoos, right. And Grandma'll let you stay up late. She'll bring out the pots and pans. - Oh, don't you worry about us. We'll make some popcorn and maybe watch some TV. Right, Mandy? - Right. It's not too much? - Hardly. - Spoken like a true gentleman. Now, go on. Go on, you two. There's far too much gorgeousness going on here. - I love you, I love you, I love you. - Bye. - Happy New Year! - Bye. - Now have fun, and I'll leave a pot of coffee for you before I turn in. - [Doctor] Good night. - Party! [people talking] [lively music] - This is great. - I lied. - Happy New Year. - Wow. George, what are you doing? - [Man] Happy New Year, George. - Hey, Lou, how are you? Good to see you. Sabrina. - Do you know Sid and Lucille? - Hey, Doc, Doc. - Yeah. - Get on over here, Doc. That wallet of your needs thinning. - Wow. - What the heck is that? - Oh, that's a garden weasel, deluxe model. So, how many can I do you for? - How about five. - [Sid] Hey, George. - What are my odds, Sid? - Well, considering you've won for the last three years, I'd say pretty good. - Come on, Doc, make it a little more interesting. - There are a number of valuable coupons inside. - Hit me, Sid. - [Sid] That's the way. - Hello, George. - Well, Linda. What a surprise. I was worried about you. I thought you might be alone. - Well, that's funny. I wasn't a bit worried about you. Where's Ann Marie? - Oh, she's off powdering that pretty little nose of hers. - Hi, everybody. - Oh, well, here she is. - Would you like to dance? - Thank you. - Hi. [romantic music] - I should have brought you a corsage. - It's not a date, remember? - We won't tell George. [beeper beeping] Ugh. I don't believe it. Sorry. - What have I got to complain about? No more bickering. No more taking what we have for granted. I love you, Annie. I'm the luckiest guy in the world. - Sounds like this kid's got a broken arm. I'm sorry. You want me to drop you home? - At 9:30 and put my mother into a clinical depression? Uh uh, I'm going with you. - Ow, ow! - I Know it hurts. I know it hurts. Bear with me. - Ow, ow! - Tommy, what'd you get for Christmas? - Galaxy 9. - Galaxy 9 - Ow, ow! - What level are you on? - Station Septumus. - No! How did you get through Canyons of Fire? - Great new, champ, worst is over. You all right? - Yeah. - Ah! I can't find the appointment cards. Can you call on Monday? - That's fine. - Tommy, leave some room on that cast. I wanna sign it. - [Tommy] Cool. - Thank you, Dr. Chandler. Thank you for helping him through it. - Oh, don't thank me. I'll be a hit at home. I've got the secret to Canyons of Fire. - You were great. All right, it's almost midnight. What do you think, back to the ball? We can just about make it. - Maybe we should call it a night. - And do that to your mother? - Hmm. [upbeat music] [doorbell rings] - Hey, Julie. - Hi. - [Mandy] Come in. - Hi, Miss Sinclair. - Oh, hi, Julie. Hi, Annie, hi, Christy. Happy New Year. - [Julie] Hi, Drew. - Hi, Julie. - I love it when it's warm like this on New Year's Eve. I feel so exotic. - So what are your resolutions? - Get Willie out of his hutch, work with Drew, and spend more time with Mandy. - I wonder what are Linda's resolutions? - Find a job. - Come work for me. - You're kidding. - You saw the place. You'd be doing me a favor. - What do you pay? - Well, what's your experience? - Two years of fine arts. - You're hired. [Linda laughs] [gentle music] - What in Sam hill are you doing? - I had such a good time tonight. - Did I tell you to wear that red dress? - [laughs] It wasn't that. It's just that it's New Year's, and I'm for a new life. Do you have your group number? Thanks. Oops, forgot to sign. - All right, well get his vitals, would you? This shouldn't take long. - Hi, Mr. Cheek. I'm gonna take your blood pressure, and I'm gonna ask you a few questions. How you feeling? Appetite? Gas? Heartburn? Chest pains? Date of your last period? - Huh? [both laughing] - It was a prostate, Linda. He was in for a prostate. - Prostate. I know. I'm so sorry. The words just kinda slipped right outta my mouth. I gotta go. - Wait, wait, wait, don't. Have dinner with me. How about Chinese? - I can't. - Yeah, you can. Takeout, I'll drive. - Drew, Willie, Chinese! - Great! - They had a special on fried squid brains. We couldn't resist. - [Mandy] Gross. - Let me at 'em, I'm starved. - I understand you're an egg roll man, Drew. - Drew, plates. - Sure. - Daddy's here. Where's Drew? - [Mandy] Drew? - Drew! Your dad's here! - I'm not going! - [Linda] Come on, Drew, he's trying. He's gonna take you sailing. - You just wanna get rid of me so you can screw around with Dr. Kevorkian. - Drew, it's just a date. - Hey, I understand, with Dad shacked up, you want your turn. - Never since the day that you were born have I put anyone ahead of you, including myself. - I just want things to stay the way they are. - Doesn't work that way, Drew. Things change. If you wanna stay truly alive, you gotta go with it. You'd be surprised what happens when you do. - Hey, Drew, let's go! I'm renting this sucker by the hour. - [Linda] He's not coming. - There we go. Hi. Look, Willie, there's a porpoise. - Where? - It's right over there. - That's a dolphin. Where's Mandy? - She's up front reading. - That's the foredeck. Front of the boat's called the foredeck. That's easy to remember. Hey, kitten. You ready for some adventure? - Sure, Daddy. - Good. All right, here we go. Adventure on the high seas! [light cheerful music] - It was weird enough after Dad bailed. I can't even handle this new guy hanging around. Everything being totally different. You're so lucky. - You want something to eat? - Nah. - I hate seeing you so unhappy. - It's nothing. I'm okay. [sweet music] - Your turn. - I need a nine. - Go fish. - Mandy. How do you do this? Okay, what do you need? - I need a... - Hi, Mom. Thank you. - What? [both giggle] [gentle music] - I bring dessert. - [Linda] What kind? - Let's see what we have here. Chocolate Fudge Brownie or Holy Cannoli. What's your pleasure? - Holy Cannoli. I'm never gonna be 25 again. - Why would I want you to be? - It's like this, Willie, now, things change. And when you change, you start to be happy. - I don't understand. - He's talking about your stupid rabbit suit. - I think that's enough for tonight. [ship's horn blowing] - I'm not Linda. I'm not Einstein, and I'm certainly not Jacque Cousteau. Porpoises or dolphins? Do you think he cares? - I gave up everything for you. - I tried. You wanted me to go back to school, I did. I read your books. I listened to your music. I'm the first to admit it, you made me a better person. But it's just not working. We both know that, George. I think you should move out. - [Linda] Bring the napkins? - [Mandy] Yup, and the silverware. - [Linda] Thank you, honey. - [Mandy] What drinks do you want? - [Linda] I got a cooler out back. We're all full. I think you better check it. - Four years ago. She died four years ago of cancer. We met in medical school. - Any kids? - No, no, it was too dangerous. We were trying to slow the disease down as much as we could. - You really loved her? - Yeah, I did. - Are you over it? - As much as I can be. As much as I wanna be, you know. - Do you think you could ever love my mom? - Well, I tell you, Drew, she's highly lovable. We both just have to wait and see. [phone ringing] - I'll get it. - No, I'll get it! - Ooh, boy. I think you may have a lawyer in the family. - How did you do? - Oh, I'm sure he'll let me know. - He's growing up. - Mom. It's Dad. - Tell him I'm busy. - How does your mother like her steak? - Mom! You better come. - He sounds crazy. - George, what is it? - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - [Linda] George. - I should have treasured you. No one will ever love you as much as I did. - George, you been drinking? - I just called to say goodbye. Tell the kids I love 'em. I love 'em a bunch. - George. - But I just can't fix what I did. Okay? And I just can't face another day like this. - George, where are you? - Mom, what's he- - [Linda] Shh. - [Drew] Mom. - George, don't hang up. George, don't hang, don't hang up, George! Oh, it sounds really, really bad. - Do you have call return? - Yeah. - He's at the Old Surf Side Motel. - [Linda] Call the police. - [Dr. Chandler] All right, I'll call from the car. - We're coming with you. - No! You're both staying right here. Don't worry. - We're going, come on. Go get your bike. - [Mandy] Wait for me. Hurry. - Mom? Drew? Anyone? [somber music] [phone ringing] Mommy? Where are you, Mommy? - [Grandmother] Willie? Honey, honey, you just stay right there. You hear me? I'm coming right now. - Grandma? [worried music] - [Officer] Well, what did he say? You sure it was that room? - He was in that room, and he hasn't left. - Wait, wait, Linda, wait, wait, wait. Don't go, wait! Wait, Linda, don't go in there. You don't know his state of mind. He could hurt you. - He's their father, dammit! - [Man] I don't think he's gone anywhere. You know, 'cause I was walking- - [Officer] Ma'am. [hand knocking] - George. George. He's got a gun. No, no, no. Hi, George. - I knew you'd come. - George, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize how much trouble you were in. - You're so good to me, even now, after all I've done to you. - You were my best friend for a lot of years. - Well, I really screwed up this time. - George, put the gun down. Put the gun down. Please. Please. - [Officer] Hey, kids. Come on now. - I haven't got anything. I lost it all. - No, you got the kids, George. You can't do this to them. I won't let you. - Don't make me live, Lin. It's too hard. I'm just not good enough for my dreams. There I've said it. I'm just not good enough. I'm not strong enough. I'm not smart enough. I'm just George Marsh. I'm just... I'm just the guy running at the back of the pack. The ass who'd rather sacrifice his son, who I love, than admit the truth. - And he loves you too in spite of it. He'll always love you. - Daddy! [loving music] - Get that outta here. No matter who comes into your life or my life, George, you will always be their daddy. There's no replacing you. - Willie. Willie? Willie. Willie? Oh dear God, let him be safe. Willie? - [Officer] Everything's all right. All right, that's gonna wrap it up. [people talking] - You're such a brave girl. - Thanks, Mama. - You all right? - Yeah. Thank you. I'll call you. Okay? [gentle music] Let's go home. Where's Willie? - Oh dear God. I'll stop frosting my hair. I'll give up those weekends in Las Vegas. I'll give up men. [Willie laughing] [hopeful music] Willie! Oh, Willie. Willie, Willie. Oh, thank you, Lord, thank you. And thank you. - Mrs. Rabbit, I presume? - Um, maybe we could just forget that last one? [thunder clapping] [peaceful music] - You've really lost it this time, Mom. [Linda laughs] - There's Venus, the morning star and the goddess of love. - [Linda] Get ready. Here comes, ah! - [Willie] I saw it first! - Cool. - This is so neat. - Just like the family in the book, Mom. - Just like the family in the book. - And we're not gonna fall off? - No, my little bunny, we're not gonna fall off. - I'm not a bunny, Mom. I'm a boy. [peaceful music] [fanfare music]
