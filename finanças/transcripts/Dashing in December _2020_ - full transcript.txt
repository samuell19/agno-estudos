My lovely wife. Here. You take this. And... cheers to your fifth year here. [chuckles] - I will drink to that. Cheers. - Cheers. So Wyatt, any big plans for the holidays? Oh, are you finally gonna meet Lindsey's parents? - Oh, um, Lindsey and I broke up in October. - Oh. Hugh, you didn't tell me that. - Oh, I didn't know. - Wyatt, I am so sorry. - Mm. - What did you expect him to do? They were getting too serious. - What, is that true? Is that why the two of you broke up? - Maybe? Or maybe it was the nonstop trips to the Cape. Or maybe it was the five-star restaurants that we had to go to every other night. Honestly, I just wanted a nice, quiet weekend at home once in a while without all the fuss. - And now you have it. [chuckles] - But what are you gonna do for Christmas? Why don't you come over to the house? - That's very, very sweet of you to offer, but I think I might be going home this year. - Your mother must be thrilled to have you coming home. - Honestly, I'm--I'm not too excited about going home. I'm still kind of on the fence. - Wait, is everything okay? - Um...I don't know. My mom seems to be having a hard time lately, especially this year, and well, it's been a while since my father passed away, so I really don't know what's going on with her. - Mm-hmm. - Well... I hope you take your laptop with you. Get some work done while you're there. - Don't you worry. I'm gonna bring all my work with me. I just thought probably the best time to do this was around the holidays while I can. With your blessing, of course, sir. - Of course you have his blessing. - Truly, I wouldn't go if I thought there was any other choice. - Beautiful horse ranch in a snowy Colorado mountain? Warm cider by the fire? Ooh, yeah, that sounds awful. - I know, beautiful horse ranch, or dried-up wishing well these days. We shall see. And my mother would throw every single penny of her retirement into that wishing well if I let her. - Oh, well, be a good son and go help her out then. Come on, Mr. Clancy.

When does he get in? - As far as I know, he'll be here tomorrow. - Wow, this is the first Christmas he's been back in, how long? Like four or five years? - That's right. I went to see him two Christmases ago, but that's it. You know, I was really starting to wonder if he was ever gonna come home. - Thanks. - Thank you. - Heath, have you even met Wyatt yet? - Nope, no, I've only been here on the ranch, what? Three years? But I do know that you dated Deb's successful son back in high school, didn't you? - Yeah, yeah, I dated Wyatt in high school till junior year. But it feels like a lifetime ago. - It sure does. Boy, it's gonna be nice to have him home. - That is if we accept his apology upon return, huh, Dash? - Wyatt knows Dash? - He should. It's his horse. - [laughs] Was his horse before he took off and left us all here high and dry. I mean, the last few times Wyatt came back, he wouldn't even come see Dasher. He basically stayed at the hotel in town. That's my tea. - Wyatt can be a bit of a loner. - Not when we were growing up, he wasn't. - Well, you two were inseparable. - Don't you think Sam might be jealous with Wyatt being home and him still out of the country? - Somehow, I don't think so. - [chuckles] - He could help fix the carriage sled, though. He knows it well. - Oh, no! You couldn't fix it? - No, it's holding on for now. But we should be back in business tomorrow. If you want, I'll blast it to the mailing list. - Okay. Thanks, hon. - That's what I'm here for, Deb. Okay, Snow. [horse neighs] Let's get out there and see... - Uh... Heath doesn't know about Wyatt? - Well, what was I supposed to say? "By the way, my son's gay too. You're two of a kind"? - No, but does Wyatt know about Heath? - Oh, gosh, Wyatt only calls to make sure I'm exercising and taking those stupid supplements he sends me. Honestly, I've never had a chance to tell him about Heath. - Well, at least he's still looking out for you. - I know. It's so sweet. My baby's taking care of me. - Hmm. - Here. To stay warm.

Maybe you'll have kids of your own one day and you'll understand. So how are things in Manhattan? - Good, good. Everything's good. - And things with Lindsey? - We broke up. - Oh, no. You must've broken his heart. From what you said, he was crazy about you. - Well, I'm sure he's crazy about someone else by now. Kid's got a lot of growing up to do. What about you? Any irons in the fire? - Oh, yes, just a revolving door of men. - [laughs] What about Carlos? You still seeing him? - Carlos? No, what? You know Carlos retired three years ago? - Okay, that's not exactly what I asked, but... - Oh, honey, it's just so nice to have you home. - Oh, sh-- - [laughs] - All right. - Uh-oh. - Not much has changed around here. It still smells like horse crap and pine cones. Who's that over by the carriage? - Oh, that's Heath. He's been working on the ranch for a few years. He and Blake are thick as thieves. - Oh, really? Traitor. - Well, everybody in town just adores him. And he's kept the place going. - Going? Going? What's going around here? Didn't seem like Hank is very good at his job. - Well, you know, it's still early and we haven't had a lot of snowfall this December. - Sure, yeah. That's it. - All right, so why did you really come home? Did you come home for Christmas, or did you come home to check on me? - Do you mind if we talk about this after I have a shower over some dinner? I stink. - All right. Well, leave your fancy shoes out here and I'll hose them off. And try to relax! You're home. - Okay, okay. [melancholic music] - Hey, what'd you bring me? - Hey. It's a cranberry kale salad. - Mmm, looks like Christmas. - [chuckles] That's what I was going for. Hey, did Wyatt make it in okay? - I guess. Uh, I was out on the sleigh ride all afternoon, and then I fed the horses, showered, so I haven't been up to the ranch house yet. - Wait, so you haven't met him yet? Ooh. [chuckles] It's gonna be good. - No, don't tell me. Is he one of those guys who makes little homophobic jokes without knowing it makes them look homophobic? Is he? 'Cause that's awkward. - Um, no. Not really. - So you think we'll get along? - I think I'm here for it either way. Come on. - All right. - Hi, Deb. Brought a salad. - Oh, thank you, Blake. - And I brought wine. - So sweet. - Where's Wyatt? - He's just grabbing a quick shower. - Washing off the stink of the city? [both laugh] - Nope. Just some good, ol' horse manure. - Ah, Sugar Cube! - Snow Pea! Oh, look at you. - Hi. Thanks. - Right, 'cause Nutmeg loves snow peas and Dasher loves sugar cubes. Dasher used to be your horse. - Used to be? He still is. - Does he know that? - [forced laughter] So tell me everything. What's new? What's going on? How is Sam? Is he still with Doctors Without Borders? - Mm-hmm, he is. I'm fine, Sam's fine. - And where is ol' Dr. Berry anyhow? - Oh, he's still in South Africa. - [groans] - Yeah. I was hoping he'd make it back for Christmas, but it's not looking so good. - Oh, I'm sorry. That's a bummer. And you must be Hank. - Heath. - Heath, Heath. I don't know why I wanna keep calling you Hank. I hope you don't mind if I mess it up sometimes. - If you do that, can I call you Sugar Cube? [laughter] - I will work on getting it right next time. So Mom, can I help you with anything? Oh, you remembered my favorite, spiced maple walnut cheesecake-- - Ah, ah, ah, you can have as much as you want to after dinner. - Great, I'll set the table. - Oh, no, no. You sit down. I'll take care of it. Do you want me to open this bottle? Oh, this is actually terrible. You literally cannot drink this. - Yeah, I brought the terrible wine. - Oh. No, I didn't, um... [clears throat] I'm sorry. - It's okay. This is thick sheepskin. - [forced laughter] - He got horse manure on his fancy shoes and I think he might be a little bit cranky. Let's have dinner. The wine's good, son. - Hmm, glad you like it. Hugh had it sent special just for you. - Wow. So how is that promotion coming? - I'm actually in the middle of this really exciting proposal for a western expansion. I've got this angel investor in Denver who's really into it. - And what is it you do, Wyatt? - Financial planning and venture capital. - He's a VP of financial planning who's well-known for bringing in angel investors, which is why it's hard for him to get home. - Yeah, this is the first Christmas we've seen you in, what, five years? - Maybe I just wanted to get you to miss me. - Oh, is that gonna be your excuse with Dasher tomorrow when you say hello to him? - Actually, I was thinking about just walking right in with a sugar cube peace offering. - Mm-hmm, well, I hope it comes with an apology. - [chuckles] - I also noticed that stunning mare outside today. I didn't know you got yourself a new draft, Mom. It must've cost a pretty penny. - Snowbelle's mine. I brought her with me when we moved onto the ranch. - You live here too? - Heath moved into the stable house last year. He fixed everything up. He redid the plumbing, he helps me out with Nutmeg and down at the vet clinic. - Wow, a regular jack-of-all-trades. - Yeah, venture capital's up next. Better watch out. [laughter] - Heath has been a real blessing on the ranch since Carlos retired. - Well, we love being here too, especially Snow. She and Dasher are fairly inseparable. They're very much in love, you know? - They're in love. Did they tell you that? - Well, it's true, Wyatt. [chuckles] Snowbelle freaked out the other day when we were giving Dash his shot. She's completely out of control and overprotective. It's something to see. - And he follows her everywhere she goes. It's really the cutest thing. It's like a true equine romance on the ranch. I mean, Christmas carriage riders just eat it up on the ranch. - I'm just surprised that Dasher isn't too old to carry that sleigh anymore. - Oh, he's just 15. And you know Dash lives for the ride. - Yeah, I wouldn't worry too much. I mean, Dash is a work horse. He's got, like, a good one or two years left in him still. - And a lot more than some of our woodland critters do. The gingerbreads are on their last leg, Deb. I mean, another storm and they won't make it, so we might... - Oh, no. Well, maybe we could think about getting some new ones. - Or we could think about just retiring the carriage ride altogether. Hmm? What? - Wyatt. Why would you say that? - Uh... This ranch is prime real estate today. Maybe it's time we think about finally selling it. - You think that we should sell the family ranch? The home that you grew up in? - Oh, come on, Mom. Don't say it like that. You know that you can't take care of this place on our own anymore. Why not move into the city? Or town? Get yourself a little house? - Wyatt, this is your mother's home. - And she's not taking care of it alone. - Okay, thank you so much for your input. [stammers, clears throat] I actually brought a few comps for you to take a look at. So this is the going rate for an old ranch like this one. And the way that this one is bleeding itself dry, we'd probably have another year in it tops. So...this might not be the right time to do this, but I just wanted you to have it. - So, um, this is why you came home for Christmas? To tell me to sell? - Of course not. No, no, that's not-- that's not the only reason. I--Mom, I know how hard it is on you. - You don't know how hard anything's been on me, son. You haven't been here. I, um... [chuckles weakly] Please forgive me. I just... I think I'm gonna call it a night. - Mom, I didn't-- I didn't-- - No, it's fine. If you get cold, there's some blankets in the chest at the end of the bed. Good night, kids. - Well, at least you were right about the wine I brought not being good. You really dated that guy in school? Ugh. [owl hooting] [melancholic music] - [sighing] - [yawns] ♪ ♪ Hmm.

I didn't know horses held grudges. - Oh, so you can talk to horses and you can tell when they're angry, but not when they're madly in love. - I wasn't--I didn't-- I don't actually believe that he thinks about that kind of stuff. - Maybe some don't. Maybe they just feel it. - Humans are incapable of loving one person their entire life. And a stallion, especially during breeding season, I assure you does not know the meaning of the word. - Wow, I think you just found your perfect Christmas card greeting. - [forced laughter] Why did you come here to work?

But if I do it, I'm doing it for you, not me. - Okay, Mom. Look. I'm sorry to just spring it on you like this, but property taxes are coming up, and of course, I don't mind helping out. It's just... I'm not so sure that you're still happy here. I mean, what exactly are we holding on for? - What do you mean I'm not happy? - I saw your garden on the way up. You let it go. - It's winter. No one gardens. - You used to mulch it and cover it during the winter. Now it's just a pile of snow. And your potted hydrangeas on the porch. I'm pretty sure they're dead too. - They're not dead. They're hibernating. - Fine. When was the last time that you had friends over for dinner? - [sighs] Okay, fine. I don't want you paying the taxes anymore. You work too hard, and it's not fair, and it--it seems like you don't even like coming here anymore. [sighs] Maybe it is time to let the place go. - Hey, I need you to know that I didn't just come here to try to get you to sell the ranch. I came because I missed you. And in some weird way, I felt like you really needed me here this year. - [chuckles] Well, yeah. And you're right. [sighs] - Did Carlos ever do anything with that lot next to us? I thought he was gonna put a house on it. - I don't know what Carlos is doing with that lot other than letting ragweed grow all over it. - Okay, one this way. Now go with your arms like this. Yeah, that's it. Wait a minute. - Hank's holiday cheer strikes again. - Hey, hey. You should be nicer to him. He really has been a savior here since Carlos retired. - Mm, well, he certainly loves swooping in and being everyone's savior. - Oh, my goodness. I have never known you to be jealous. But that sounds like jealousy. - Pfft. [tuts] I'm not jealous. The guy's a horse whisperer. I seduce millionaires for all they're worth. - [scoffs] - So, Deb. I really hope you said no to your son. - Actually, not that it's any of your business as this is a family affair that does not concern you, but if you must know, yes, she is considering it. - I meant you can't consider letting your son pay for cocoa. Have as much as you want. It's on the house. Mmm, delicious. Oh, oh. You meant the ranch. Yeah, you shouldn't sell that either, Deb. It wouldn't be good for the horses or the ranch. Or the business. - Business? Business. What business? Are you talking about that tired, old holiday sleigh ride? How many customers have you had today? Was it just the three of them? And we both know that kids get in for free, so what is that, 20 bucks? - Okay, so the carriage ride isn't as much of a moneymaker as it used to be. So what? Next year, we're gonna make a killing on this ranch. - And how do you propose to do that? Because holiday profits are a bust. - Well, Heath has an idea that we could start teaching riding lessons again. - And use the free stalls for horse boarding as well. There are plenty of people inside the county line who would want to board here. - This place was and always will be a money pit, so even if you come up with some clever, creative magical way to bring gross revenues up by 50%, we will still be 50 in the hole. So please tell me, where does that money come from? [scoffs] You let me know. - [sighs] [gentle music] ♪ ♪ [exhales] - ♪ O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree ♪ - That guy's completely impossible. He called the ranch a money pit. What kind of guy drops a bomb like that on his mom at Christmas? - Okay, uh... [chuckles] I didn't mention it before because it's not my business, but... Wyatt is paying to keep the ranch going. - [scoffs] What? - Yeah. Wyatt took over paying the mortgage and the property taxes on the ranch over three years ago now. - I'm sorry, are you telling me that Wyatt is the one keeping us afloat? - Uh-huh. He's paying your salary every month, my vet visits, not to mention Deb's ever-growing pile of bills. - I just... [scoffs] I can't believe I didn't realize it. I mean, yeah, it makes sense now. Of course. - Hey. Wyatt didn't want Deb to throw away her entire retirement on the ranch, so he took over the payments. He does care. Even if he is a Scrooge. - Well, fine. But it doesn't change the fact that he's trying to destroy the one thing his family worked so hard to build. Doesn't he know how much it's gonna crush his mother? - Yeah, I think he just believes he's doing what's best for her, you know? - Yeah, yeah, 'cause he thinks he knows everything. Everything. - [chuckles] - He can't just roll into town 'cause he's this rich city kid now and start calling the shots. I'm not gonna let him. - What are you gonna do about it? - I'll prove him wrong. - [chuckles] - Yeah. [gasps] Oh, look. Aren't these just lovely? - [sighs] - Look. - Yeah. - [sighs] [kettle whistling] - Stables don't have their own stove? - [groans] - Oh, sorry. [stammers, sighs] I didn't mean to actually scare you. Are you okay? - Yeah. I'll just go back to the stable house where I belong and put this under some ice water. - I said I'm sorry. Can I take a look? - I brought your mom an arrangement from town. And I was gonna sit out by the tree with some tea because I don't have a tree at the stable house. - It's gotta be cool or lukewarm. It can't be ice water. Will you follow me to the sink, please? [chuckles] - What, you have a medical degree as well? - Just put it under there for a minute. And no, I don't, but I did pick up a few things from Blake's dad back in the day. He's a doctor, you know? - Of course. Everyone in town goes to him. He's great. I'm not sure why he'd let his daughter date someone as difficult as you. - You really think I'm awful, don't you? - I think you're in dire need of some Christmas spirit. That's for sure. - Hmm. [chuckles] You're not wrong. I guess-- I guess I am a hard sell when it comes to Christmas. They just play that terrible music for so long. And after a while, the lights becoming blinding and-- and in the end, all the holiday's really managed to do is remind you of everything you wish you had, but don't. - Wow, yeah, what's your big holiday wish? A house in Cape Cod? Your very own jet plane? - [laughs] Now you sound a lot more like my ex, Lindsey, than me. - "Lindsey." Wow, what a lucky woman. - Luck--man. A lucky man. Lindsey's a man with facial hair like you. - [scoffs] You're gay? - You sound so surprised. - But you dated Blake all through school. - Yeah, I was confused in high school. I--I didn't know who I was. I knew that I loved Blake, but I think I also knew that deep down, the relationship had a shelf life. - So when did you finally come out? - Around the same time that I broke up with Blake. I was moving to New York. I just graduated. It wasn't easy growing up here. Colorado clearly has its...charms. But it also has its difficulties, especially when it comes to small towns and locals. - Oh, yeah. Don't I know it. - You out around here too? Sorry. I didn't mean to just assume that you were gay. It's just--well, my mom told me and, um... [both laugh] Well, your eyes don't lie. - What? I didn't check you out or anything. - I didn't say you did. I'm just saying that, uh, when you know, you know. - Yeah, well, I guess I should've known about you too because if you're not that into Blake-- - "Well, then you must love men." [laughs] - Yeah. - That should be good. Here. Why don't you wrap it in this? [gentle music] - Yeah, it's--thank you. - Good to go. How about that tea? - Okay. Thank you for this. - Well, thank you for taking care of my mom and this whole place. She seems to really appreciate you. - Yeah, well, I really appreciate your mom. And I love this place. Never really feels like work. - Why is that? The ranch? Why do you love it so much? - [stammers] When I was 12 years old, my dad took off with some woman he'd met at a work conference. I didn't really understand what that meant at the time, but I do remember it was summer, and the vacations we used to take as a family suddenly stopped. And my mom, well, she cried a lot. I remember her crying from her room at night, even after she thought I'd fallen asleep. After a few months, it wasn't every night anymore, but every other day, it would happen again. And I knew she wasn't any better. And then, Christmastime came, and I thought it would be so hard, but one night, she bundled me up in a snowsuit and brought us here. I had no idea where we were going, but when we showed up to the carriage ride... [exhales] It was like a whole new world. The lights and the horses, people everywhere. Happy people. - Yeah. I remember when this place was something special to the town. To all the neighboring counties as well. It was... [sighs] It was my father's pride and joy. So your mom loved the place too, huh? - She did. We were so happy that night. Yeah, we curled up under the blankets and-- and we were just taken away. [sighs] You know what? That Christmas, she started getting better and better. I think this place gave her a little hope again. I, of course, loved this place too, so we came back every year after. - What does she think about you running the place now? - She's gone. Almost three years now. - I'm sorry. - Thank you.

Where did all these people come from? - They're here for the carriage. Can you believe it? We have not had a turnout like this in a dozen years. - But how? - Wyatt's boss had his PR gal send out a social media blast to all the followers of a little company you might have heard of, Ponderosa Organics. - Ponderosa Organics, but what do we have to do with Ponderosa Organics? - A lot now. Wyatt struck a deal with them this morning to open their next organic farm right here on our western expanse. - But what about the horse race track? - The only horses that you're gonna see on this ranch are ours. [chuckles] - All right, this one is for you and this one is yours. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Sneaky you. I was wondering where you disappeared to this morning. - Yeah, I got a little text from Deb that you needed some extra hands. - Yeah, here we go. We got fresh hot cocoa. Real milk, or organic oat? We have both. - I'll have milk. - I'll try the oat. Thank you. - All right, now who here is ready for a winter wonderland adventure? [kids cheers] - Well, I say he makes a mighty fine cowboy. - Sure does. Hey, we'll meet you on the carriage. Snazzy. - [chuckles] - What are you doing back here? I thought you'd be back in New York at the office or out partying in Fire Island by now. - I came back to say I'm sorry. And to thank you. What I said was a lie. It wasn't any of you who were in hibernation. It was me. I didn't even realize it until I came back here. Until all these people I love woke me up. Until you did. - And what is this about you buying the ranch instead of your investor? - It now belongs to me and one other investor. We're gonna split the farm between Carlos' property and our south side, so the horse land won't suffer. Well, a few acres for sustainability, but the majority will remain-- horses, stables, everything. - I'm still not moving to Manhattan. - Good, that's a relief because the way things are headed, Mom's gonna be retired and married in no time and someone needs to run this ranch, the horseback riding lessons, and--oh. Once we turn the carriage ride into an affair for all seasons, well, I was hoping that maybe you would consider a promotion. To partner. - [scoffs] Partner? - Well, the lots of little ideas was kind of your idea. - I don't think it's a good idea for me to stay here. What, with our history, we shouldn't be working together, even if you are out there. - That's a good point. What if I were here? - Why would you be here? - Well, we're expanding out west and as the newly appointed senior VP, I should probably spearhead that venture. Not to mention, I need to find my boss a new property. He's not too thrilled about me stealing this one from his buyers, but most importantly, I would really like to take you out on a date. A real one this time. We can go horseback riding. A little dancing. Wherever you wanna go, I'm in. - Good. 'Cause you still owe me that projector movie night. Just don't screw it up this time. - I won't. You got plans tonight? Your heart's beating fast. - That's on you. [clicks tongue] [birds chirping]
