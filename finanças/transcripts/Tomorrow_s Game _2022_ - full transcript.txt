(upbeat music) (Reporter speaking in Spanish) (Carlos speaking in Spanish) (Reporter speaking in Spanish) (Carlos speaking in Spanish) (Reporter speaking in Spanish) (Carlos speaking in Spanish) (audience cheering) - [Reporter] .399 this season, .337 career we have a bit of a down season thus far, but still 67 RBIs- and they have left an outstanding 15 runners stranded. - [Daniel] Oh man! - [Reporter] One runner on first base, Dominguez pinch... - [Daniel] No! Tsk. No. - [Jorge] I bet you're a natural at baseball, huh? You gotta be. - Baseball? - [Jorge] Yeah! I mean it's gotta be in your blood, in your genes, I mean, after all you're Santiago's- - He's my uncle. - [Jorge] Yeah - Yeah. I'm Daniel. - De La Rosa! I knew it. Can I tell you something? I'm a huge, I mean huge fan of your uncle's. - Yeah he's great at hitting the ball, and running, and yeah. - He's the greatest short-stop I ever saw. Nothing would get by him. I mean, you must be a short-stop too right? - Um, I play uh, catching? I catch. - Oh? By the way, my name is Jorge, Jorge Robles. - Ah, pleased to meet you. - Yeah. And there she is. Oh my! I never get tired of looking at this stadium. I mean this stadium brings so many memories, I don't even know where to begin. But you know in 1957, I remember distinctly that they changed ownerships. And um, all the kids from all the neighborhoods would come in and sneak into the game. Nobody cared! It was a wonderful summer. Well, so you're getting all emotional back there, Daniel? - No, no, no. - [Jorge] 'Cause it's okay, it's okay, I mean I don't judge. - I'm sick! - You're what? (Daniel retching) (upbeat music) (cameras shuttering) (upbeat music) (straw slurping) Well look who's feeling better! (straw slurping) Want a sip? Okay, I'll take that as a no. By the way I'm supposed to remind you to make your way down to the event hall. - The event hall? - Yeah, just down the hall. Keep an eye for room 207, and it should be near by there. - Got it, 201. - No you don't got it, 2-07. - 207, got it. - Now you got it! Oh. - Huh, thanks. Yeah I'll tell my uncle to sign a puck or something for you. Thanks chico. 207, 207, 207, (Jorge speaking in Spanish). (gentle music) (gentle music) - [Jared] This is Jared Berkhart. Your most trusted source for baseball broadcast. (gentle music) - Bottom of the second, hitting fourth for the Jethawks, Wilson Harris. (gentle music) - They've had enough of their colored pitcher, and sent in a more steadfast replacement in Jacob Lancaster. - Uncle Santiago? (gentle music) - Daniel. (chuckling) Well you look just like, what do the kids call it these days a baller in that getup. Kind of like I do. (chuckling) - Not really. (Santiago speaking in Spanish) - You're always joking around. - Oh I wasn't joking. Um, actually, I- - Oh you wanna say something at the ceremony? - What I want to say is, I don't think I should be at the ceremony today. I'll just embarrass you. - Where is this coming from? Daniel, what's wrong? - It wouldn't be coming out of nowhere if you were listening. I don't, I don't belong, Tio. (gentle music) What is that? - Oh, this recorder is a classic. They used it on the booth, way back when I used to play the game. - Oh, so it's like, super old. - Well, I'm not going to take offense to that. But yeah, I guess it is. That tape on it is from my very first Major League game back in 1957. July 16th, 1957. Seems like ages ago. - Today is July 16th! Weird. And this card reminds me of that day, and it reminds me of your father. - This was his? - It was, and I always keep it on me. Why don't you hold on to it today, maybe it'll make you feel better? Careful, that's the only tape they have of that game, and they gonna have to queue it up for the ceremony later. - So why aren't you out there, with the rest of them? - Uh Daniel, I'm not always as confident as I might seem. I just came in here to get away from it all for some peace and quiet. - How's that going? - Huh. That old machine is reminding me of of how hard it was coming up. All I ever wanted to do was, - [Both] Play ball and make my family proud. - Yeah, I know. You say it all the time. - And for some folks, that was still too much space for me to occupy. (gentle music) (static crackling) For some folks, that was still, (static crackling) too much space for me to occupy. (static crackling) Too much space for me to occupy. - Am I dreaming? - Are you okay? - Yeah, I guess I'm just still, just probably still woozy from the car. - Are you just messing with me? Wait a second, did you get car sick on your suit again? - I made it to the bathroom this time. (Santiago chuckling) - Oh, you remind me of your father in that getup. - You know, he was with me the day they made that recording in 1957. He got to come in the field, and he went with me in the batting cage. He was so excited. (Santiago chuckling) I guess I better get down to the dress rehearsal, and let 'em put some makeup on this old face of mine. Feel free to lounge around here. Or come down there if you'd like. Only if you feel up to it. - What's the big deal about a stupid ball? What, is this supposed to be like impressive or something? Oh wait! Ugh. (objects clanking) (tape whirling) No, no! What did I do? (tape whirling) Seriously! Ugh, I ruin everything! (dramatic music) (tape whirling) (static crackling) I shouldn't even be here! (tape whirling) (static crackling) (gentle music) Oh man. No, no way. (gentle music) (both screaming) (objects clanking) Stop! (both screaming) (objects clanking) Stay, stay, stay. Stay back! Stay back! (both screaming) (objects clanking) Don't hurt me please! I don't want to die! - If I wanted you murdered you'd be murdered already! (objects clanking) I'm not a murderer! Obviously! - That's something a murdered would say! - Kid, get a grip. Are you crying? - No. - You break into my barn and then call me the murderer? What's your deal? - My name is Daniel, and I didn't break in. I don't know how I got here! I'm so confused, I just want to go home! So hit the road! You're cruisin' for a bruisin' if my momma finds you in here. Are you going to a funeral? - You wouldn't believe me if I told you. - [Sally] I don't believe you either way. - Fine, I was somewhere else, and the room went blurry, and I ended up here. I, I think it had something to do with that. - My, my broadcast station? - [Daniel] Yeah there was a broadcast station and these other- - Don't touch that, don't even look at it. I swear if you breathe towards it I'll chase you with a bat again. - Are those recording tapes? Tsk, everything in here is so old. - No, not a funeral. An asylum! - What? - [Sally] Tell me your last name so I can have them pick you up! - De La Rosa, okay, De La Rosa. - Wait, Like him? Are you his little brother or something? - Huh? No, that's my uncle. - I didn't know he had a nephew. - So I'm guessing you're a fan? - Are you kidding? The first Dominican player to be signed to a Major League contract. A prospect who jumped to the Major Leagues after only two seasons in the Double A, skipping Triple A entirely? - Uh, yeah, he's good at baseball. - Hi, I'm Sally. Sally McDavies. They call me the Great Bambina. Well, no they actually don't. But they will! - Well I'm glad you didn't commit a murder a minute ago. - Yeah, consider yourself very lucky. Now, what was that about my broadcast station? - [Sally's Mom] Sally! - Quick, you need to get in the closet now or my momma's coming! - Good, I can tell on you for attacking me with a baseball bat. - [Sally] Closet now! - [Sally's Mom] What are you up now? Sally! Sally. You better not be in here. Wait, what is that I heard? There's some rustling in that barn, I'm coming in! (upbeat music) - Figueroa Street? Oh no. This can't be real! (upbeat music) This is Figueroa Street? - Jumpin' junebugs, what was your first clue? - Well, the street sign. - It's called sarcasm, melon head. - Hey, first of all, you're being mean, okay? And second of all, I think I'm going to need to have another look at that broadcast station. - Sure, you can have another look. For a small fee. - How about free? - Hey how about a knuckle sandwich? Hey nosebleed, how about two? Okay so I'm supposed to believe that you're actually the De La Rosa's nephew, you're from the year 2002. The President of the United States is a woman named Kelly Clarkson, and that this machine is the reason you're here? - No, Kelly Clarkson is American Idol, not the president. They're different things. - Gee Daniel, that's awful nifty. You can tell all the nice folks at the funny farm about it! - Look, I know it sounds crazy, but that's exactly how it happened. I seriously have no reason to lie about it. - Prove it. - What is that? - Um, this is my proof. - Your proof? I've never seen anything like this. - That's my video game. - You, you really are from the future? - Yes, and I need to get back. But you just got here! And I have so many questions.. Can anyone be American Idol? Can I be American Idol too? - Ugh, I should've never said anything about that. Listen, I've ruined everything, I need to get back. And I need your help. - Okay young Saint Rose. Show me exactly what you did before. - Okay. Gee, throwing a baseball can't be that hard! - Wow. Flawless. (ball thwacks) (tape whirling) (dramatic music) It's working! Get ready Daniel! Well, it's toast. (gentle music) The electrical condenser is broken. - Okay, where are the other electrical condensers? - I don't know, Daniel! Why don't you go out back and ask my cows where they are? My dad built this thing himself. Can you ask your dad? - No. But, I do know who we can ask. - This is your solution? - Hello Mr. Ice Cream Man! One pineapple, one strawberry, and one, watermelon. - Si! - Watermelon for you. Strawberry! Pineapple! Thank you good sir. (Ice cream man speaking in Spanish) - Oh I got it. Here. - Keep the change. (Ice cream man speaking in Spanish) Um, Sally let's go. - Se√±or. - Wow! - Hey, what's the strawberry for? Wait, wait, wait, you said you had a real solution. You didn't say anything about baseball. - Baseball is always the solution. Wait, why did you say baseball like that? - Baseball is just bad news for me. Just a bunch of grown men in tights, kicking a ball around. - You've never been, have you? - How'd you know? - Because anyone who's ever been to a baseball game would never describe it like that. Let's get a move on! You might be a challenge, but, you're in the 50s now, so there's a first for everything. (crashing sounds) - Okay, wait. Who is that, and why are we going there? - That is strawberry. Come on! - [Jared] This is Jared Berkhart, your most trusted source for baseball broadcast. At bat, we have Gerald Funches. And let me tell you folks, it's been an abysmal season for this player. - [Jorge] Imbecile! - [Jared] His .270 average is a full .50 lower than he was doing in the minor leagues. - [Jorge] You're worthless! - [Jared] And that's a solid hit by the colored gentleman, but it's a foul ball. - You are foul! Sally, he's so generic. He has no class, no energy for us "colored" people, and praises the gringo more when he hits a foul ball! Dios mio! Who cares about the foul ball, Sally? - Jared's a cube. - Who is Jared? - Jared Berkhart, he's- - A crook, and a hack! It's a crime the way he calls these games. Strawberry? - [Sally] Strawberry! (Jorge speaking in Spanish) - You're the best! Hmm, it's sinful how delicious this is. You look familiar. Who is he? - Well this is, - Daniel. Pleased to meet you uh- - Jorge, Jorge Robles. Have we ever met before? - Uh, well, I guess not exactly? - Have you? No way! This is bonkers. - I know, right? - What was he like? - Definitely not like this. A little nicer? - Beans! How so? - Well he- - Hey! Por Dios. Is someone going to tell me what you two are talking about? - You wouldn't believe us if we told you. - Try me. - You should probably sit down. - I'll stand. So, you're from the future. And you're, you're Santiago's nephew? Well that's just weird, amigo. Am I doing this right? - Eh, no. Alright, we're looking for this part. For a specific machine Sally has. Can you get us one? - It belongs to an Ampex Quadruplex. It's a newer model, but Sally's very similar, and they both share many of the same internal parts but, 2002, huh? - Hey, strawberry. Focus! - Sorry. Unfortunately, it's very rare and can't be found at a hardware store. - Oh great. - I do know of a place we can find one. But, it only exists for Jared Berkhart, at the stadium. - That's the guy you don't like, right? - Yeah, you wouldn't either if you knew what type of man he is. (upbeat music) Back in the day he was part of this strange collection of underground ball-club elitists who tried to prevent the great Jackie Robinson from signing with any Major League team. And when este viejo couldn't prevent that from happening? He started spreading his intolerance through his broadcasts. Frankly, he stinks. Now, what do you think he's going to do when your uncle starts his first game this Friday? The first game that represents people like us, huh? - I don't know, but it probably won't matter. The last time I saw my uncle, he was listening to that game. I don't think he seemed bothered by it at all. - How can you be so sure about that, chico? Now, see, there's a new owner who's trying to change things. But, change is hard. - Well, in the end, it's- - It's just baseball. There he goes again. - Wait, you've never been to a game before? - I've played a game before. A video game, - Don't you see how much help he needs? This video game nonsense doesn't even make sense! Baseball is a game. A real game! A real life game that makes sense. Ugh, Jorge, please. I can't take this anymore. - Sally, you know I'd do anything for you. However, my connection to the stadium no longer exists. You can thank Jared for that as well. - What? - Once he found out I was supposed to be next in line as a Junior Broadcaster, he made sure I never had a job again. - Oh! That son of a b- - Baseball time! I've got a game to call. (gentle music) - I'm uh, really sorry that happened to you Jorge. - I'm sorry too, chico. - [Daniel] There's no other way? Nothing else we can do? - No. So I'm, stuck here? - I'm so sorry Daniel. - There just has to be another way. - Let's ice it for now and enjoy the game! (bat clinks) - That's a line drive toward second! And he can't get to it! Like the wind, Jefferson blows past first, and gushes towards second! Pamello at Center Field scoops it and throws to Morillo at second! Jefferson slides. He's safe! The Wind of J is now in scoring position. And what a start to this game, amigos! - What do you see, rookie? - Well uh, I see a field. Grass? Sand with edges? Bases? I mean I don't know. - To me, this is where the magic happens. - I, just see what I see. - You're so stubborn! You really need to let yourself see the fun that's in front of your futuristic face. - And that's strike one for the 17-year-old left fielder who comes to us from the beautiful city of Havana, Cuba. Maravillosa. - Look. Now I can sit here and tell you that the batter only has .75 seconds to make a decision to swing or not, once the ball is thrown, of course. Or, I can see you how it truly is. The pitcher and batter are locked in this moment in time. Nothing else matters. Not the crowd, not the coaches, not the players on the field. Heck, not even the scoreboard. It's, just the two of them. They're locked in this rare moment of competitive embrace where only one of them will make it out on top. (gentle music) And the best part of it all. They each get a second chance of redemption with every pitch. Life doesn't give you many second chances, but baseball gives you a whole lot. "Baseball is hopeful," my pop used to say. Wouldn't it be great if life was like that? (bat clinks) (gentle music) Yes! Go, go, go! - [Jorge] To the opposite field, it's going to drop in there for a base hit. - Wow! - The runner on second will score. And Domingo will stop at first base. Un hit maravilloso! (gentle dramatic music) The pitch, and he takes off! The throw is made and, and he's safe! Safe at second base. And boy that chico Domingo is fast. Too fast! - Wow. - Now you're knowing. That little move right there is called a steal. (audience applauding) - Oh my god, I got it! - [Sally] What, how to find a suit that actually fits you? - No, Sally. - A steal. - Yeah that was incredible, I'm jazzed! - No, stealing, like we could steal. - Daniel, this may shock you, but I think you once again have lost your mind. - No, I'm saying what if we can break into the stadium, take the extra parts from Jared's booth, and fix the machine! - No. - What other choice do I have, Sally? - I don't know! But we can figure something out. - This is me figuring something out. - Daniel, your bright idea is a panic-and-a-half. I don't wanna get caught and actually end up in the funny farm. - Sally, I need to do this. I can't just stay here. I don't belong here. I might as well end up in the funny farm as it is. - Got it. So if life is so horrible with me then I'll just leave you to it. - No, Sally! - Just give her a minute, And that is the top of the inning, we will be back with the bottom of the 5th. Mira chico, I don't know you very well, but I can tell you right now, Sally is tough as stone, but deep down, she's still a scared little kid like you. You know, she brought you into her world. A world she calls home. Be kind to her, okay? And welcome to the bottom of the 5th, where this game continues to be a wild one. (gentle music) (Daniel clearing throat) - The, uh, pitcher winds up to throw to the swinger. - It's batter. - The batter bats at the ball. - What are you doing? - He throws! And that's a, a strike? Attempt number two. Can he do it? (bat clinks) And wow! A fine hit! Look at it go! - Yes! Go, go, go! - [Both] It's gone! - That was awesome! - Awesome? - You guys don't say that yet? - No. - It's like, saying something is awe-inspiring. Awesome. Awesome! I like that word. - Hey! - Hey Jorge, awesome game, huh? - Hey, I'm thinking the real game hasn't even started yet. I couldn't help but overhear the big plan earlier. - You know the drill! No tellin' my momma nothing, I'll get so in trouble, Jorge! The only person I'm looking to get in trouble is Jared. I'm in! We'll sort it out at your place tomorrow Sally. (gentle upbeat music) - [Jared] Well, folks please join me in wishing veteran Short Stop, Connor McDarmott, a fond farewell. His catch now marks his last inning as a Los Angeles Jethawk. He'll be replaced Friday with integration experiment, Santiago De La Rosa, while I get my Spanish dictionary ready... (crickets cricking) - Is everything alright? - It just bugs me how differently Jared calls the game. It makes me think of what Jorge said, about my uncle's first game and how Jared might call it. - Jorge is pretty rockin'. Jared is a wet rag! But you won't have to hear it too much longer if Friday goes well. - You'll, you'll be home soon. - Well, I guess so. - Can I show you something? Come on. - [Daniel] It's so quiet. (crickets cricking) - Mm-hmm. That's why we're out here. - I haven't done this since I was a kid. - Um, you are a kid. - I mean, I haven't done this in a while. - I used to do this all the time with my pop. He used to look up at the stars like they had all the answers. I don't know if he found what he was looking for, he never got the chance to tell me. But, I sure enjoyed sitting next to him while he tried. - Well, my parents and I would always look up at the stars too. My dad would make up these stories about how the stars would look down at the people on Earth. He liked to say that they were smiling at us. - Daniel, - Yeah? - I'm glad I wasn't the only one with goofy parents. They must be so worried. Do you miss them? - I definitely miss them. They're looking down at us now though, with the rest of the stars. - I'm sure my dad is too. Sometimes, I still feel like he's listening to that 1956 All-Star game. - The recording station was you dad's, right? - Oh, yeah. He loved it. I like to play it and act like he's listening with me. From up there. - Like you said, he is. (crickets cricking) - Wake up! (Daniel screaming) - Hey tranquilo, tranguilo amigo! - It's just us! - We have no time to waste! - Hmm, give me a minute. I'm barely awake. - We got coffee ready. - I'm too young for that, I think. - Hey, let's just smack him again! - Let's just do this. - Okay, here we go. I'm so excited. So, every entryway is blocked off by security. Here, here, and here. These are the only proper ways to gain entry, and the proper ways to get jailed. - Any improper ways? - I like your style, chico. There's one. Right here. - You're crazy. - It's the best spot. - Alright, so shift changes are longer around that area. That gives you ten minutes to reach the main building, pick the locks, and figure your way inside. - Sally picking locks? Why am I not surprised? - Hey, when you go back to the future and you lock your doors, remember my skills. Jorge, how are we going to walk into the inner stadium in the middle of the day, dressed like this? - Well, that's the other reason I chose this area. The lockers. - The lockers? What about them? - You'll see. - Now, Jared's booth is somewhere in this area. But they've shuffled things around since I was let go, so you'll have to do some detective work to figure it out. - So you're looking for the main broadcast booth? - [Jorge] Si. - It's, 207! - Sure, okay. But one more problem, This isn't a lock you can pick. You're gonna have to either take the keys from one of the janitors, or, find them in the janitorial closet. - [Sally] Daniel, are you nervous? - Let's do it. - Sweet, okay. So you are gonna need these. - Uh, won't these make us stand out even more? - Pea brain, I said you'll see. - Oh, this is so illegal. Jared is going to be so mad. I'm so excited! Okay, I got some preparations to do, but I'll see you both bright and early tomorrow. Alright! - [Daniel] And with uh, an ERA of 1.95, the pitcher is doing a great job of punishing all of the swingers, I mean, hitters, at bat. So with an ERA of 1.95, he is really seeming to do a good job, - Hey! - Oh, hey. - What are you doing? - I'm just, uh, trying to learn a little bit more about baseball. Reading the book. - I see. - [Daniel] Yeah, - What's going on in your noggin? I just sort of realized, that if everything goes well tomorrow, I'd be going home. - Are you gonna miss me? - It's possible. - Well hey, we can always look up at the same sky. - That's true. And, it'll always be looking back down at us. - [Baseball Broadcaster] And that's it folks. The Buffaloes two, and the Exporters four. A wonderful afternoon game out here at the stadium. See you next time. - Okay, this is it. You both ready? Daniel? - It will be fine, Melon Head. Unless your big melon head is too big to fit through the front door. (Jorge laughing) Catch you on the flip side Strawberry! (gentle music) - Hey, why are you walking? Apurele! - Well, this is it. - Yup. - Watch me do this in a dress. (upbeat music) - What are you doing? - I need a moment! - [Daniel] What, now? - Thank you! Amen. Okay, now we can go. - What was that? - We're invading sacred grounds, Daniel. I had to ask the baseball gods for forgiveness. - Unreal. Unreal. (upbeat music) - [Jorge] This is Big Papi for El Chico. Do you copy? Over. - I copy Big Papi, over. - Cut the gas. The lockers are down these steps, come on. Well Daniel, I hope the baseball gods don't hate us after this. Nope. Ooh, Daniel! Neat. Bingo! Right here. - [Daniel] Uh, what are those? - Our camouflage. - [Sally] Hey, you ready yet? - Yeah, one second. How do I look? - Like you belong. - Hey! What are you two doing in here? - Well, we're just, we're making sure this locker room is fine and dandy. - I haven't seen you two around before. Are you new? - I'm, Da, David, Gomez. And this is my good friend Sam. Sam Bambina. - Sam? - Sam Bambina? - What happened to Frank and little Jerry? - They died. - What? - [Charlotte] What? - It's a form of expression! - They haven't shown up in a while, and well, uh, it's new slang for, uh, kids that haven't shown up in a while. - Right, well uh, we better get on our way. Gotta make sure that dugout doesn't have any sunflower seeds. Yeah! - Wait. - Don't forget to take the crate of baseballs to the opposing dugout. David. Sam. - Ow! Sam and they died? - You weren't saying anything! - [Jorge] Yeah, that was bad man, over. - How did you hear that? - Let's get a move on. It was worth a try. (gentle suspenseful music) (Daniel speaking in Spanish) (gentle suspenseful music) - Hey, what do you got there? - Here, you can keep it. - Thank you! (gentle music) (Santiago speaking in Spanish) - [Ricardo] Look what I have, big brother! - July 16th, 1957, seem like ages ago. This card reminds me of that day, and it reminds me of your father. - [Daniel] This was his? - It was. (Santiago speaking in Spanish) - Daniel, we're in! Hey I said we're in! Daniel? (gentle music) Ready to do this? - Yeah. (upbeat music) (indistinct chattering) - [Both] Whoa. - Jorge, you're up. What direction do we go next? Over. - That's Big Papi to you. What do you see? Over. - [Daniel] I see a lot of agents and business people, over. - Got it. You're at the VIP boxes. You're gonna want to go straight and take your first left. The inning is almost done, you gotta go now, over. - Got it. (upbeat music) - [Jared] And in the bottom of the second. Hitting fourth for the Jethawks, Wilson Harris. - [Daniel] Yeah come on. - Daniel! - [Daniel] What? - He might hit! We may be witnessing history before we leave. - Yeah, I know. - I like your serious face. It's really cute! - You're not helping. Now come on! (gentle suspenseful music) - Sh! He'll hear us! - You're the one talking! - Why are you still talking? (gentle suspenseful music) (Daniel sneezing) (gentle suspenseful music) - [Jorge] Big Papi to El Chico. Four minutes and counting. How are we looking? Over. - Flying in now, over. - Here goes nothing. (key rattling) Perfect! Okay we're in. (door shutting) - [Both] Whoa. - Start looking! - Anything? - Nothing. Nothing! Oh you're letting me do all the work? Thanks! I've got it! Papi, can we confirm the serial number? - Big Papi to Great Bambina, we're looking for number 37, over. - This is 37! This is 37! We did it, over! - [Jorge] Big Papi to Great Bambina. That hurt my ears. Please don't do that again, over. - Hey, hello! Pay attention! I've got it! Let's go! Let's get a move on. You're slower than Jorge rounding the bases. - What are you doing? - You go ahead. - Jorge is waiting for us! - Just go! It's important you get that part outta here. I'll be there in a minute! - Daniel! Ugh! This is what I get for trusting a boy with a melon head. Okay, I can do this. Everything's labeled. (gentle suspenseful music) - Now listen, you got this job because they told me you were fast, okay? I need score. (upbeat music) - Jorge, we've got a big problem. Start the car! (upbeat music) - And welcome back to, the bottom of the fifth, where it has been a wild one. Coopers one, Jethawks nothing. - I'll need the latest scores too, alright? Oh, I'm late! How could you possibly not tell me this? - [Daniel] Um. - What the heck? - [Daniel] Uh, oh Jason Eckers is now on the mound. And here comes the 2-2 pitch to, - What the heck is going on here? - Oh I mean, 3-2. Wait! He struck him out. Harris seems to be a bit nervous. I know I am. (upbeat music) Okay, one away, in the fifth. Next up, we have uh, Jeremy Bullock, a lefty. - Daniel? You crazy son of a - (Jorge laughing) - Stick it to him you crazy chico! You really are a De La Rosa. (door knocking) - Hey you little devil! Knock it off right now! - And that is a four-pitch walk for Eckers. A high intense moment, I am very anxious to see what happens next. - Come outta there! Open the door! - It seems like the game has been close up until this point, Come on, tio, come on. Come on. - Somebody call security. Will you call security? Get over here, open the door. (door banging) Come on, get it open. Cut the live feed! - Oh, he smells just awful. - I have a nervous stomach. - Please remain calm. - What do you think you're doing? Well, I'm sure you'll have something to say for yourself in prison. - He looks like a minor to me, sir. - Well then, they have juvenile prison for troublemakers like you, and I'm going to see to it that you experience one first hand. This is what happens when we integrate you people into our league. - [Charlotte] Excuse me. - [Jared] Mrs. Higgins? - It's Ms. Higgins. What is going on here? That smell is horrible. Jared, is this the condition you keep the booth in? - Look I'm sorry Ms. Higgins. I've never seen you here in my booth before. - My booth. - Right, well, I want to press charges on this weasel. For trespassing, theft, grand larceny, desecrating these sacred halls- - I see. Well, what you don't know, Jared, is that David works for the stadium. And today we asked him to test the sound equipment. Is it all in working order, David? - Fine. I gotta get back to my broadcast and fix this mess. - Go on, then, Jared. (gentle suspenseful music) - Daniel! Oh, hi miss. I found that on the floor in the locker room. Pretty cool, huh? I'll just take that back. - Interesting. You know, you're not the only kids to find treasure in this stadium, this one is particularly rusty. - Why did you help us? - I own the team. I can do what I want. - You own the team? That's so, awesome! Tell me more, please. - So, if you're in charge of the team, then why don't you help where it matters and make Jared stop discriminating against my uncle- - Your uncle? - Uh, I mean, against the players. They should be called equally. - What do you think I'm trying to do? I mean, I may look the picture of success. - You are! - But as a working woman, it hasn't always been rainbows and daisies, especially in the baseball community. I know all about Jared, and when I heard your broadcast I knew.. - Knew what? - We're on the same team. Which brings me back to this little treasure. I mean, to some it may look like an average piece of rubble, but to the right person, it's a signal to do the right thing. - What? - [Charlotte] Stay out of trouble, while you're at it! - Oh, she's so awesome! Come on, we gotta go meet Jorge. (upbeat music) - [Jorge] There they are! - Hey! (upbeat music) - We did it, Strawberry! - Ow! - That's for leaving me stranded back there. - I have to say chico, that was really good. Crazy like La Llorona but good. - La Llorona? - La Llorona is a wailing spirit, much like Daniel. - Hello? Jared is still in there, and I felt people were finally starting to tune in. A signal to do the right thing. - Yeah, it's too bad I'll never hear you announce another game again. - Signal. Hey Sally, how close is your barn to the south side of the stadium? - Um, maybe five, 600 feet? - I see where your head's at, chico! Uh, we're gonna need scrap metal, a coaxial wire. - Oh, no! Another steal? We'll probably all end up in the funny farm. Let's do it! - Yeah! (upbeat music) - Uh, okay Sally, can you go fix the machine? - Easy. - We don't have much time. - Jorge, can you grab the TV and set it by the station? I'm gonna set up the radio. - Power cables! (upbeat music) Radio, television, condenser, we need a tape! - A tape? - You were in Jared's booth, did you not grab a tape? Okay, it's fine. I got this. - Oh you have an empty tape? - Well, no, just trust me. Okay then, let's do this. - Hey! Be careful. You grabbed your Dad's All-Star tape instead of the empty one. We could've recorded over it. - Listen Melon Head. This is the tape. - What do you mean? - It's almost time. - It's the only tape we got right now. Come on, you really are slower than Jorge rounding the bases! - Hey, I heard that. - No, I won't use it. This is the only thing you have left of your Dad. - I know. This tape is my connection to the past. But you are the future. I won't let you stay stuck on this decade another day. - The game is starting. (gentle upbeat music) And welcome back, folks. This is our final inning in the 9th. And, (static crackling) hey what is that? (static crackling) - Here, these might help, to keep the flow. - And the score is still one to nothing as we get approach the end of this match between the Coopers and the Jethawks. Uh, Eckers seems to be unstoppable as he continues to ensure the Coopers keep this lead alive. - What the heck is going on here? Is this that same kid? (bulb shattering) - [Jorge] Ugh, great. The bulb burst! - [Sally] Thomas Edinson failed us! - Sh! Sorry about that uh, we have a little interference going on over here. - Wait, wait. I have an idea. Listen for me. - [Jorge] Whoa whoa, where are you going? - You'll see! Daniel, do you copy? - [Daniel] Loud and clear. - I think, I think he's coming up! - I need a name Sally. A name. - De La Rosa. Do you copy? - I, copy. - [Sally] Just remember everything I told you about him. You got this. - And what a historic moment. We have none other that the hottest prospect in recent memory making his Major League debut here in the ninth, no less. - Santiago De La Rosa! (audience cheering) - Daniel, listen. (audience cheering) Ready? - Let's do this. (audience cheering) - And the crowd goes wild at the sight of De La Rosa. It's as if they know they're going to witness greatness in the years to come. (audience cheering) Ooh, that misses. Ball one. Oh that's uh, not the best sign. Seems like Eckers is starting to sweat for the first time tonight. - Great call. - Oh and uh, it's perhaps the ridiculous legacy that De La Rosa has behind him from the minors, you gotta remember folks, he was called up after just two seasons! And that's a strike inside! But not even a flinch from the 20-year-old De La Rosa. (dramatic music) Oh, ball two. Deep in the ninth, Eckers really seems to be digging into his reserves, but he has been dominant. (gentle dramatic music) Here comes the two-one, and a swing and a miss! That is strike two for the young short-stop. A solid swing but just missed it. That is two fastballs and two curves. That back-door slider has been his go-to in these final counts, so let's see what he banks on. (ball thwacks) Ball three. Full count! (gentle dramatic music) This is it folks. This is the game right here. (gentle dramatic music) Yet, the hard-working De La Rosa understands a life of adversity. This moment is not too big for him. I mean, look at that scowl, he is just ready to embrace anything that comes his way. Just the life he'll have. Just like the life we all have and it's only one folks. Dios mio! - Are you sure you haven't done this before? (gentle dramatic music) - Here we go folks. The payoff pitch. (gentle dramatic music) (bat clinks) (gentle dramatic music) (crowd cheering) - Adios amigo! (gentle dramatic music) (Daniel speaking in Spanish) - [Daniel] That is out of here! (crowd cheering) (gentle dramatic music) And that's the game! That's the game! Jethawks win it two to one! (all cheering) - We gotta celebrate! I'll go get the champagne! - We can't drink Jorge! - I'll get the cider then! - We won! We actually won! - Yeah! Aye, mira que cute! - You did it Daniel. You were so great! - Well, I guess we all did it. You and I did it. (crickets creaking) - [Sally] Be honest. Did you actually vomit in Jared's booth? - [Daniel] Hey, I was nervous! - Neat. I can't believe my favorite ball team is owned by a woman! Today baseball, tomorrow American Idol. - Chill! - Sh! You know, I might push my way into owning a team one day. Well, you're really good at pushing. And punching, and pinching. You're very talented. - Oh please, - Shh! - You're gonna miss it one day soon enough. - Sally. - I know. - I have to go. (gentle music) (gentle suspenseful music) (static cracking) It worked! I think it's happening. - It's okay. It's okay. Melon Head. (gentle suspenseful music) (static cracking) - [Stadium Employee] Daniel? Daniel, right? - [Daniel] You aren't Sally. - No, um, the event, it's already started. Wait, what day is it? - Friday. The event. - How long was I out? - Um, I think you've been in here a couple of hours. - It doesn't make any sense. - Sorry? - Um yeah, sorry I'll be there in a few minutes. Oh wait! I think I accidentally destroyed. - Oh yeah! Your uncle wants you to bring that, so they can play it when he's ready. - [Baseball Commissioner] Now, it is my privilege and honor to welcome our newest member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Mr. Saint Rose, himself: Santiago De La Rosa. (audience clapping) (gentle music) - Thank you. Thank you. (Santiago speaking Spanish) Well, I uh...am not very good with speeches, but this is a true honor for me. When I started, I never thought about what I was doing or what it meant for others. I just wanted to play baseball. But I soon realized, what it truly meant for folks like me. That realization came right after my first game in the big leagues. Well, I'd like to play my first at-bat ever for you, and I guess it's just to show you where my motivation came from. (radio clicking) - [Daniel And what a historic moment, we have none other than the hottest prospect in recent memory making his Major League debut here in the ninth, no less. Santiago De La Rosa! And the crowd goes wild at the sight of De La Rosa! It's as if they know they're going to witness greatness in the years to come. (audience whispering indistinctly) Oh, that misses! Ball one. The payoff pitch! It's out of here! And that's the game! That's the game! Jethawks win it two-to-one. (gentle dramatic music) - Oh, Daniel, I understand everything now. - You do? - You wanted to stay in the recording booth so you could provide me with your own commentary on my special day. - You're welcome. - Of course, that's not exactly the way I remembered it. But this one is way better, because my nephew recorded it for me. (Santiago speaking in Spanish) (gentle dramatic music) Who's that, huh? Hard to recognize me now. This is, this was when we first won the pennant. Charlotte, she was so excited. She did so much for this team. You know, she is the one that called me up. - I thought you didn't even baseball. - Yeah, I guess uh, someone just gave me the right push. (gentle dramatic music) - I'm gonna have to go wrap up here. You'll be okay alone, no? - Yeah yeah, I'll be okay. I'm just gonna look around a little bit. (gentle dramatic music) - Oye, Daniel, adios amigo. (gentle dramatic music) - Jorge? - It's El Chico! - It's so nice to see you again! - It's nicer to see you. Get in here. (gentle upbeat music) Where to, boss? - I don't know, but let's take the long way home, and just talk a bit. - Oh, okay. - Actually Jorge, (gentle upbeat music) let's take the super long way home. I want you to tell me everything. - Long way home it is! Now, you know about '57, because of what happened to Jared. But in '58, I became a broadcaster. And in '59, I became a father! Now I'm sitting here, with the great, Daniel De La Rosa! God has answered every prayer. Let's go. (car engine revving) (upbeat music) (singer singing in Spanish)
