He just came and settled down here. What about his family? What family? His father is dead now. And now he is an orphan as well. So his wedding won't happen anytime soon? - Wedding? How will it happen? He can keep selling old photos and hats. God! Haider Sir left after making all this wealth, right? He is really lucky, right? Lucky? What's the point in having all this wealth? That's also true. What are you fiddling on that for? Did you know? - What? He left after leaving the Wi-Fi open. Where is he coming from? - What? Do you want to download any movie? - No. Has everyone been informed? - Even I was late to know. Does Hamid have any relatives? God knows! - That's all life is. What to do? - What's the point in saying that now? I can't see him lying like this, oh God! It's been quite long since Haider's wife died, right? Those are things that nobody knows. Poor Hamid. Well, weren't there any proposals considered for his wedding? How? Will anyone who knows Haider's history, want a relation with this house? My dear mom! Hamid Ikka is not a girl, right? His wedding would happen somehow. You don't have to worry about it. - Still... That's not how it is, right? Hamsakka! Where is Hamid? He must be around somewhere. Shouldn't we take the body? Didn't you see the time? Go and look for him! Hamid, you're sitting here? Shouldn't we take the corpse? The people from the mosque are here, son. My dad is gone, Hamsakka! Come, son. Get up. Whom do I have now, Hamsakka? Hamsakka... Hamsakka, both of you are sitting here? I came to call him. You bring him. (final prayers) 'My Mother's Name' Son, Hamid... Here. Where did Beeran go? I don't know. Son, Hamid... You don't worry. Hasn't your father said that death is a journey? And that everyone should bid farewell to the departed happily? It's easy for those who leave to say all that. But it's people like me, who become all alone, right? I'm sitting here without any clue. What are you trying to say? Apart from this wealth, whom do I have, Hamsakka? Has dad ever said whether I have relatives or whether I have a mother? He left without saying a word, keeping everything in his mind. I can understand your grief, son. It's true. Haider was quite strict. He hasn't opened up about many things to you. But his heart was full of love and affection for you, son. What's the point if the love is hidden in his heart, Hamsakka? Has dad taken an initiative to do anything for me, till date? Before leaving me all alone, couldn't he say if I have any one else, or at least who my mother is? You are not alone, son. We are all here for you, right? Do you know who my mother is? You are dad's close friend, right? Tell me if you know. If you ask me so... Son... In the lives of certain people, there would be certain incidents, that they would never want to remember. And they will keep them as a secret in their minds until death, never revealing them to anyone. These thoughts that you don't have anyone, would go away once you get married. Marriage? - Well, I was just saying... You think about the rest. - Hamsakka... The sun hasn't even risen after his dad's funeral. Before that you've started making Biriyani for his wedding? I said it because it has to happen some day or the other. Why are you shouting for that? When did I shout? - Beeran... Leave it. - Hey! If you don't keep workers at their place, there will be many problems. Hamsakka, what did you say now? Nothing. I was saying that it's time for me to leave. - That's what. There are many expired pieces like this in this world. They should be leaving from here first. - Beeran! You go inside. What is this? That's rice. I brought it for him. - Rice? You go and have it if you want. Go! Couldn't you buy some Biriyani? He has brought rice instead! Then, shall I? I'm leaving. You eat it and get some sleep. Hamid, eat the rice. I don't want it. Eat it, man. Haiderikka is happy up there. Don't make him upset by refusing to eat this. About the wedding, I was just trying to instigate Hamsakka. The wedding should happen. What Hamsakka said is right. Do you know something? When Haiderikka brought me here from Arafath's shop in Kondotty, he told me only one thing. That I should be with you, always. I am with you. Eat it. Hamid! Come. - Where are you going? - To have some tea. The shop just opened, right? - Hassankka opened it to serve tea, right? Not that shop. This shop. As if people have queued up here. Last year a foreigner bought a Gramophone from Tipu Sultan's times. No one has come here after that. You come. Come, come! - Where are you going? Come in. Sit down. Hassankka, what's there to eat? Shall I get you good Parotta & beef? How's the beef? What beef? No, no! I mean, the beef is great. Shall I get it? - Yes. Son, Moosa... 2 plates of Parotta & beef. Well Hamid, are you doing good? How's your business doing now? It's going great. Your dad made a mistake like that. And you are also continuing that? Pack all this and give it to some scrap dealer, and start a new good business! What animal is this? Whatever! Oh God! It was a camel? I didn't understand because it was upside down. Hamsakka... Where did you go, leaving the shop open? We went to have some tea. Oh God! He must have killed you, right? We escaped by a whisker. Do you know what I've come for now? Have you seen Moideen's daughter, Sainaba? No. You haven't seen her? Try to remember properly. If he remembers hard, can he see someone he hasn't seen? He can see this one. No, I haven't seen her. You tell me the matter. Then, we are going to see her. Hamsakka, are you serious? It's only been so long since dad died. And already? Hey! Do you wish to get married? I do! But... That's his all-time desire, right? Then we are going there on Sunday, to meet her. If everything is okay, we will fix it. The wedding can be planned gradually, right? - Yes. Shucks! Shall we go, Hamsakka? - Are you flying? Come, Beeran. - What? Whose bride-seeing ceremony is it now? Hamid's. Why do you ask so? Well, I just asked seeing this attire of yours. Once we go there, no one should say anything bad, right? They would never say so. You look like a scarecrow kept on the fields. I lost all my confidence. Shall we go? Come, get in. Right away! The groom looks quite handsome. Yes, he is very good. Did Sainaba leave with the tea? - Yes. Hamid is the only son. Who else do you have, Hamid? We are all there for Hamid, right Beeran? And there's me, like a brother. He was saying that he's like a brother to him. So who are you actually? He's asking who I am actually! I am Hamid's friend. This is Hamid's father's friend. Did you like the tea? Yes, I liked it. What is your name? Sainaba, right? I know. Sit down. I... You? I'm not that used to talking to girls. It's a line said by all boys these days, right? I swear, it's not. My father was really strict. So I haven't spoken much to girls. The only one I have opened up my heart to... is to Bincy, while studying in the LP school. To whom? Bincy. Bincy who stays near the Mosque. She's not there now. She got married & left. Which college did you study in, Hamid? I didn't study in a college. I studied privately. What did you study? B.A. B.A., Malayalam. It's not such a bad degree, okay? But I didn't say anything about it. Don't you have anything to ask me? Do you dance, Sainaba? A little bit. Why? You like dance, right? Yes, I like it. What do you like the most, Sainaba? I like my mom the most. And in general, I really like people who are honest and sincere. You don't worry. There's nothing to think about. Haider's entire wealth will be for him and his girl, right? Hamid is here. Did you like her? Then, what is your decision? Let us think about it. We'll let you know after that. That's enough. No hurry. Think about it. Well, Koya... Does he have any relatives? Relatives... Should I get my daughter married to someone who has no relatives? I'll tell you. You get going now. Come, son. We're eating beef daily. We can eat beef. Beef is fine. It's protein. - Is it? Greetings! - Greetings! 4 Parottas & 2 plates of beef. Moosa, 4 Parottas & 2 plates of beef. Are you doing good, Hamid? What's so good, right? Well, did you go to see Moideenkka's daughter for an alliance? And was the wedding fixed? How will he fix it, right? Who will give their girl to you, an orphan? Who told you that he's an orphan? That's crazy. Your father is no more. You don't have any relatives to show. You don't have a mother, even for a namesake. What else can such people be called, other than an orphan? How can you decide that he doesn't have a mother? Stop blabbering and bring her and show me then! Don't you want Parotta & beef? Eat it yourself! The whole thing? Isn't that Hamsakka? Hamsakka... What is it, Hamsakka? Well Hamsakka, I don't understand what's wrong with him. What can he do, if he doesn't have anyone else? Not that. Why did he have to tell her about that Bincy? Who? Bincy? Yes. That Antony Chettan's daughter. What's between you and her? - Nothing. What's the actual reason, Hamsakka? What can I say? Moideen realized that you are Haider's son, only when you went there to see her. I don't know whether it is because of some old grudge against Haider. Is it because I am an orphan? Yeah right! Orphan! This is not all that. Shouldn't he understand what he has with him? Is he like all the other boys now? The only thing he has is a B.A. in Malayalam. That too, private. And some chicken muscles too! Stop blabbering & keep quiet, Beeran. I'm not saying anything. Did Sainaba say anything, Hamsakka? No! I didn't even get to see her. As if this wedding is going to happen because of Sainaba's word. This is not going to happen! Why did you say all that? It's usual to be unglamourous. Why should he have a complex for that? Even though Kunjavan Thirumeni made many attempts to rescue the mansion, shattering Radha's might, Mohini appeared in her biggest form... Do you want a mic? You ruined that flow. Come and help me with this. - I have dance class. Him & his dance class! Sainu? Why is he coming here now? Beeraanikka... - He sounds like a rooster. I need to poison his dance master. Will be sorted only then. Crap! Hamid! Where is the girl from? From Kolasshery. Ummarikka's daughter? - Do you know her? Doesn't she have some mental problem supposedly? That's the younger one. I'm marrying the elder one. Beeran! - Yes. Ikka! - Sainu... When did you come? - Right now. Did you know? Tell him. It's my wedding. Wedding? - Yes. Yours? - Yes. Are you of marriageable age? Yes. - Day before yesterday. It's happening at Plaza Hall on the coming 15th. I have told everything to Beeranikka. You should come. And yeah... I know that you are mourning your dad's death. Still, you should come. Even small kids are getting married these days! You don't worry, Ikka. If you have the good fortune, you will also find a beautiful girl. You will also find one. I have to invite many more people. Shall I leave then? Come with Hamidikka. Don't forget. Okay then. You don't worry. He'll be jumping around like this only until his wedding is over. Why? - He's marrying from a family where there's a mad person. Hey! I've found something superb. - What? A will. - Will? - Yes. Whose will? - My father's will. Call Hamsakka. We need to go to a place. The money I get by selling this, has to be split into three, and I have to pay dad's two wives a share each, according to his will. Will? Where did you get a will from? From dad's old suitcase. I already knew that Haider had two wives. But I've never heard about such a will. Didn't you hear it now? Well, who will get the third share? That's for those who do charitable works. Then it's for me only! For your dad! Son, what is your decision? Everything should happen as per dad's wish. Are you crazy? Whom are you going to give it to? Dad has written all that very clearly. I should give it. I have to find my mother. And I have to marry a beautiful girl. Who will give their daughter to me, if I don't have parents? So I must find who my mother is, at any cost. Won't you help me, Hamsakka? But I never dreamt that dad had such a side to him. By the way... You read it in detail once again. Why? - We have to know whether there are more than two, right? Son, there are a lot of things that you don't know. No one knows Haider like I do. Stop bluffing! How come you didn't know about this will then? Hey! First you should choose good friends! I had told that to Haiderikka earlier. Will you help me or not? Say that. Why do you ask so, son? What else was I doing all this while? If one of them is my mother, I need to know who it is. Then your wedding will also happen! Yes. That's also there. Dude, are you serious? Yes, I am serious. Why? Well, you left the column of your mother's name empty in 10th grade. That's because I didn't know it, right? Beeran! Beeran! Go! Go! Yes? Beeran? - Don't disturb my 'childrens', please. Sorry. Come here, Beeran. - Yes, Master. Come here. What is this? Your rhythm is completely wrong! Mine, sir? This is not child's play. We have a show day after tomorrow. Sir, just five minutes. I'll be back soon. Don't humiliate me in front of him, please. Beeran, you are a professional dancer. Be practical! Yes, of course. Please bless me. Just five minutes. Thank you. Why did you come here? Who asked you to come in here? I've decided to go and meet dad's wives. Where are they now? One is in Kozhikode, and the other one is in Ponnany. When are you going? It's not about when I am going... The problem is how I am going. You should go in a bus. If I get down from a bus there, won't that bring a bad name to dad? What bad name to Haiderikka? All his people travel in the bus, right? Still... It's more powerful if I go there in a car, right? Then go in a car. Yes. To go in a car, it's better that there's someone who can drive well with me, right? Who? Me? I can't come. I have a dance programme. Don't say that, dude. You just have to come and get it started. Rest I'll handle. If he calls you, you can go. I can't come. Anyway, ever since dad left, I am all alone, right? Whoever says that they will be with me... Shall I leave? - Hamid! Who said that you're alone? I am with you, right? Even otherwise, you would make me fall for this, saying something. Even otherwise, who's going to call this dance team, that always gets stone-pelting? Yeah right! We have lots of programmes. So you get pelted a lot? Get lost! Beeran, it's time to hold the rope. Come. - See! What is it, Hamsakka? You're tensed that you'll have to take care of the house and shop alone? Did you understand now that business is not as easy as farming? Bullshit. Is this necessary? Necessary? We can't keep the shop locked. I didn't ask that. Is this journey necessary? It is, Hamsakka. What is your decision? I have to go there and find my mom, and give her the money dad asked me to give. Then... Then? Then I must bring her here. Is any of this going to happen? Our rockets have reached Mars. This will happen. Hasn't Haiderikka said that we should always be positive? Okay then. As you wish. Don't forget whatever I told you. Take good care of the business, okay? Bye, Hamsakka. See you. - Bye. Shall I leave? Bye. Hamid! What are you doing here? I come here once in a while. Dad used to bring me here since childhood. Now I came to give them some stuff. Your dress is quite good. Did you like it? When you came for the bride-seeing, I thought you were really old-fashioned. Oh no! I usually wear such clothes. I wore that dress that day because Beeran forced me. Is that why your dad objected to the wedding? No, right? - Hamid! Beeran! Don't you remember? - Yes. Come. Careful. Come, come. Hamid, I didn't get egg puffs. Egg sandwich. You didn't get egg sandwich? He failed in SSLC. He isn't that educated. Where are you going. with a bag in hand? I am going to Kozhikode, to my mother's house. We're also going to Kozhikode. Shall we go together then? Is that necessary? - Why? Won't your dad create a problem, if he comes to know? Are you scared, Hamid? He's really scared. No! I am not scared. Then let her come. Then I'll also come with you. Then get in. Okay. Come! It will be okay, right? - How's that? Hey! Get inside. Not there. Here. Beeran, start the car quickly. Why do you want to go so quickly? Are you in a hurry? I'm not in a hurry. I'm also not in any hurry. Shall we cancel the trip, then? - Get lost. Go slowly. 'The bright sun meets droplets of water, to turn into a rainbow' 'My heart is swimming like a fresh petal of dreams, in these eyes today' 'As starry flowers, all over this path, shining bright' 'As you smile, near the window of the heart' 'The bright sun meets droplets of water, to turn into a rainbow' 'On either sides of this moment' 'We understand the hearts of each other, equally' 'As words fall short, the heart flaps its wings to fly high' 'A tune that is as shiny as silk' 'We are rowing far away, through this path' 'The bright sun meets droplets of water, to turn into a rainbow' 'My heart is swimming like a fresh petal of dreams, in these eyes today' 'Swimming like a fresh petal of dreams' When did you see me for the first time, Hamid? During the bride-seeing. But I've seen you several times, before that. Really? Yes. What is this journey actually for? My father had two wives. I have to meet them, and I need to find who among them is my mother. If I have a mother, no one would say that I'm an orphan, right? Is that it? Then... Then? Then, if I am not an orphan, there are certain things, right? It's been 3 days since we left Thalassery & we reached Kozhikode only now. Beeran... Get inside. Is it police checking in civil clothes? Whose car is this? Can't you see? It's my car. Your car? It's his. It's my car. Why? From Thalassery? Yes, I am from Thalassery. - Haider sir's? I am his son. Hamid, didn't you recognize me? How can he recognize you if you wear a helmet? - Oh. Sorry. Shivan Kutty. Shivettan. Shivetta, he didn't recognize you. Wear the helmet. Well, who are you? I am the all-in-all. What are you doing here? We came looking for someone. Whomever you came looking for, if my boss' son is in Calicut, he can't leave without coming to my shop and house. The car is okay, right? - Yes. Even if it's not, it became okay when I touched it. Okay. Then follow me. Come on! Who is it? - Who is it? Dad... - Dad? He has two mothers. Does he have two fathers too? - Follow me. Anyway, it's a profit. Come. Zeenath. - A cashew-nut shop? Nice name. - I need to have some. Come, sit. Zeenath must be your wife's name, right? No. - Is it your daughter? Just a second. I have to make a call. Hello! Here. Look. Secular, huh? He must be a Communist. Hey! Isn't that Hamsakka? Wearing pants and all. God! Isn't that child me? Is it? - Yes, it's me. When was this taken? Okay. I'll call you. Do you remember it? It was taken during the shop's inauguration. How will you remember? You were too small then. Well, how do you know my dad? Your dad... For me, boss is like God. I started my life from boss' shop. I was a worker there. But we didn't see you for the funeral? Right? Boss always says that we need to happily bid farewell to the departed. If I come there, I would cry. So dad says this dialogue about death to everyone, huh? Leave all that. Why have you come? You came looking for someone? Well, he has come to find his mother. I don't remember whether he brought you from this Ramlath's place, or from his second wife's place. But when boss returned after a journey, he had a baby with him. That is this Hamid. A journey? - Yes. Where? Well, he used to travel a lot to buy stuff for the shop. And... boss was really interested in the arts, right? So there were many such trips. I've also gone with him many times. Where all have you been? If you ask me so... Jaipur, Meerut... Bombay, Lucknow, and so many other places. Stop blabbering after getting high. As far as I know, boss has never left our town. Even when I called him once to Lulu Mall, he didn't come. And he says Lucknow! Keep quiet, Beeran. Hey! Shivetta... Do you know dad's wives personally? Great! Your Hamsakka, right? Even he doesn't know these things. I'll get some water. Have you gone bonkers? To ask him all this? He doesn't know all this. - Hey! He will hear you. Here. It would taste great with Biriyani. Just sprinkle it over the Biriyani. Zeenath's dry fruits and spices. Shivetta, why didn't you get married? When I wished for it, it didn't happen. Then I didn't feel like taking the effort for it. You were in deep love with this Zeenath, right? It didn't happen because it was an inter-caste relationship. Isn’t that the truth? You are really sad about it, right? Marriage is something great. So, anyway, don't avoid it. Why? You want to get married? We came to Kozhikode, as a part of that plan. Once you feel that desire, don't delay it at all. Get married immediately. Otherwise, you'd become like him. Here. Keep this in your bag. Zakeer Manzil. Zakeer Manzil. So this must be the house. Park the car somewhere away. I'll get down here. Can't we park it inside? We aren't sure that this is the house, right? Park it away. Can't I turn it around after taking it inside the gate? Do whatever you want! It's because he doesn't know how to drive. It's useless telling him. Go! Go! I've finished the work downstairs, right? Now if I get the workers, I'll finish the rest of the work too. I'm just asking a little money for that. Bloody rascal! I'll pop your eyes out! Didn't you take money from me? And now you're fooling around? If you don't finish the work in the house before Ramzan... I'll finish you! Get lost! Bloody hell! He doesn't understand what I say! If I don't get workers, how can I finish the work? What can I do now? Who are you? I am Hamid. Which Hamid? Isn't this Ramlath's house? Did you name her keeping her on your lap? Whom? - Ramlath. Oh God! I didn't mean that. What did you mean then? I am Beeran. Which college are you studying in? - A college nearby. Who is he? This is Beeranikka. He came to see mom. Go inside! Beeranikka! He has come to see mom, it seems! Why are we standing outside? Can't we talk sitting inside, uncle? When did your dad marry my sister? Stay right here. Who are you guys? I am Haider's son, from Thalassery. Dad is no more. So I came to meet Ramlathumma, and inform her. No one here cares whether he is dead or alive. Don't step into this house, saying that. There's no Ramlath or anyone here. Hey Mister! Mind your words! Oh God! - Will you shave me off otherwise? Don't touch him. Did anything happen to you? - It's really paining. That was bad. That was really bad. Then I'll give you also one. Aren't you hitting him then? - Should I? Yes. - I will hit him. Hit him. - Shall I hit him? Hit him! - Oh God! Run away! Rascals! Dude, is there a mark on my face? There's no mark, Beeran. Even if there's no mark, it's paining quite badly. Go to sleep, man. Is my tooth shaking? Only I got slapped, right? What is this, Hamid? Oh God! Earthquake! - My darling Ikka! Shall we run to some ground? My Ikka! It's not an earthquake, man! This Khadeeja has fallen hard for you, Ikka. This is that only! I didn't know that you had so much love for me, my darling! It's bad. They are culture-less. Should we become like that? No need. Come. - That's true. That's a culture-less thing to do, right? - Yes. But still, once more. - Again? - You don't look so strong! - I don't want to hear it. My dear Ikka, please go to sleep. Is it over? A huge storm and rain are over. Ikka! It's not over yet. It's starting with thunder again! Your wife is so lucky! Hello! Can't you go to sleep? My darling Ikka! The mirror in the room, broke with all that action. Come out. - Hello! Hello! Just a minute. Okay! Hamid, come fast. Look who's here. What? Oh no! Zakeer! - Didn't you leave? Luckily we didn't feel like leaving. This is not Zakeerikka. This is yesterday's darling Ikka! You little devil! We heard all your romantic dialogues from yesterday. Oh God! You're still alive, huh? Ikka, I didn't know that you were so loving. Who are they, Ikka? - Friends. - Go inside, I say! Go! Why did you take a photo? To put it up on Facebook. Let everyone know about your love, Ikka. Oh my God! Don't betray me! We will! Do you have quail meat here? Quail meat? - Yes. Fried. It must be over. Shall I ask for tea? - No. I'll have milk. I'll have Horlicks. Then I'll also have Horlicks. Son, Bashir... Get them two cups of Horlicks. Horlicks? - Yes. Well, Zakeerikka, who are these people? They are an old friend's children. They are poor. They are starving. - Okay. 2 Horlicks! 2 boiled eggs, as well. Where will you stuff it in through? We should have gone to some big hotel. This place has less items. That's true. Let's have Kuzhimanthi for lunch. Yes, mutton! You can follow me in your car. - No need. I don't trust you that much. Hop on, Hamid. Then who will bring the car? - I'll bring it. You alone? I'm not carrying it on my head. I'll be driving it. I understood you from yesterday. If you consider your life precious, hold tight. What is this? A horse? - Beeran! Open that gate! Me? - Oh God! No! I'll open it myself. You wait here, son. Bring the car in. God! Children! Look who all are here! This is Hamidikka and that's Beeranikka. Greet them. - Greetings! Greetings. My darling and sweetheart. This is Rinza, and that's Raziya. I met them earlier. Go and bring something to drink for these brothers. Shall we bring tea? - What about Mosambi juice? Orange juice would be great. Whatever! Please go inside to get it. Go! Go fast. I have raised my children to be very cultured and well-behaved. You raised them, right? But they don't seem to have a problem because of that. What do you want? Juice is coming, right? After that, we're leaving only after eating, be it ghee rice or Biriyani. I didn't ask that. Tell me what's your intention of coming here now. My father had written a share for Ramlathumma in his will. So I've come to give that money. Oh God! You came to give money? Then why didn't you say it yesterday, my dear son? I hurt my dear Hamid's feelings unnecessarily. And my cheek too! That's all right. It's all right? I saw stars in my eyes! Orange means grape here or what? Is it sweet enough, Ikka? I can have some more. It's already too sweet. Please go inside, children. There they are, smiling again. You also go. Go and bring Ramlathumma. Ramlathumma needn't come for that. You can hand it over to me. Why? For you to spend it at some lodge? For God's sake, please don't humiliate me. Just because of a desire, I made a mistake for the first time. But that's not what the lodge staff said. They must be saying it out of jealousy. Go and bring Ramlathumma fast. I'll bring her right away. Please eat. Eat all of this. She will come now. Come. I am Haider's son. Hamid? Yes. Dad... Dad is no more. It's been a few days. When dad left... he had written a share in your name. I've come to give you that money. No. Even if I take it, it's the same as her taking it. You step out. I need to talk to Ramlathumma alone. I'll be outside. Why have you come, actually? Tell me. Are you my mother? No. You're lying since you have a family and children now, right? You can tell me the truth. I won't tell anyone else. Why are you smiling? So you did all this drama, to know this? Well, I came to know that my dad had two wives. So one of them must be my mother, right? So is it you? I need to prove that I am not an orphan, to my townsmen. Tell me the truth. Are you my mother? Shall I tell you a truth now? I can't get married because I'm supposed to be an orphan. If you are my mother, come there, get me married and come back here. Son... The relationship between your father and me, existed only for two weeks. It was a wedding that Haider was forced into. But I can never forget Haider. Haider was the one who took an initiative to divorce me, and marry someone else. You're really fortunate that you are the son of such a father. You don't worry. You will definitely be able to find your mother. Hello Master! - Stop the car & talk on the phone. Yes, Master. Night? No. No plans! I'll definitely reach. Yes, let's have one more rehearsal. Okay, bye. Where will you reach in the night? Hamid, it's the anniversary of Chokli Arts & Sports Club today. We are doing a dance programme. Not just that, tonight is my debut performance. Beeran, let's go to Ponnani as well. Hamid, I don't want to waste time by coming to Ponnani as well. Such a nuisance! That won't be your mother. Just to trouble me unnecessarily. Yes, dude. Now I'm a nuisance for you. Even otherwise, I don't have anyone, right? I am always alone, right? Okay, dude. Bye. Hamid! Sorry. I will come. I knew that you won't leave me stranded. I was just playing a trick. Yeah right! Not to Ponnani. To the bus-stop. You can go in a bus. That's better. Beeran, this is too much. I don't have a father or mother, right? Hamid, you should understand something. My profession is most important for me. I am a professional dancer. Okay? Hello Hamsakka? Couldn't you come back with him, Hamid? Was all this necessary? Hamsakka, my dad had two wives. I realized that one of them is not my mom. So who's the other one? Who is it? - My mom! I will go there and find her, and bring her there... and I will marry Sainaba. Wait and watch. Let's see how that happens! Okay. I'll call you. I've reached my stop. Chetta, how much? 50 Rupees. Chetta... Which is this Aishuthatha's house? You mean 'Hyper' Thatha? - No. Not Hyper Thatha. Aishuthatha. Aishu.. Yes, that only. Go straight... After two turnings, you can see a road. Her house is at the end of that. Chetta, how much is this? One Rupee. Pack ten of them. There goes the Hyper Thatha you asked for. I can't give fish for ten Rupees. Did the fish say that? Fish for 10 Rupees itself is too much for me. Abdu, your behaviour is not right. I won't let you leave unless you give me fish. Get down. Get down, I say! - This is such a nuisance! Nuisance? Ten Rupees is that silly for you? Put it in here. Don't be so stingy. Come on, bring them on! Hold this. I'm taking this as well. Get lost! How many times do I have to kick the sewing machine to make 10 Rupees! Chetta.. - What is it? Aishuthatha's house? - Hyper Thatha? Not Hyper Thatha. Aishu Thatha. - Both are the same. That's her house. This house? - Have you come to meet her? Yes. Go! Go! Oh God! God! He gave me fish for 10 Rupees, quoting the price as if it was gold. This fish is good. I need to take some for myself tomorrow. There's no one one here who reads your books. Your business won't happen here. Go back! Are you Aishumma? If I am? I am Hamid. From Thalassery. I am from Ponnani. Do you know a Haider? Haider! That rascal who's not even ready to divorce a wife he doesn't want. Don't come here saying his name! I have a knife that cuts fish. I'll slice you up! Get lost, boy! I swear on God, I'll slice you! Shut up and leave. What do you want? Haider sent me here. I don't want to hear anything about him. I don't care if he is dead or alive. He hasn't come looking for me all this while, and has sent someone to talk about him now. After ditching me like a cat or dog, he has sent someone now. That rascal! Dad... Dad is no more. I couldn't find any of his old people. That's why I didn't inform you. Why have you come looking for me now? Are you my mother? Why have you come now? If you are my mother, why don't you come with me? I won't come. Oh God! I'll end up dying with the roof falling on my head. Isn't it better to come with me, than staying here alone like this? When dad died, he wrote all his wealth in my name. One share of it is written in your name. That's how I understood that you are here. It's because I didn't know! Dad was like that to everyone. Even to me! I came, when I knew about it, right? Can't you come with me? If you come with me, I'll take real good care of you. I am leaving! I hope I get a bus to go back! Hey! Here, hold this. So, are you my mother? If we get late, there won't be another bus to Kozhikode. Come fast. Oh God! My mother! Come, boy! - Coming, mom! Don't walk so meekly. Walk smartly! Come fast. Who's over there? Come here. This boy has no sense! Walk! Those who have to get down, get down fast. Changaramkulam! Get down fast. Get down fast. Hamid, come and sit here. Isn't that a ladies' seat? - What ladies? Sit here. - Start the bus. Sit here. How old were you when I was born? When I was 16. So it was a child marriage, huh? What? How many years has it been since dad left with me, from your place? As many as your age! That's all. Anyway, I found you now, right? I like this. Here. Is it nice? Those who have to get down, come on! Vadhyar Peedika! Don't fall. Slowly. Get down fast. Hold my hand. Come, mom. Look! Hamid is coming with his mother! What did you say? It won't be my mother, right? Look! My mom! Mom, this is our shop. Firdous... - Come inside, mom. Move away. Make way for mom. This is nice. Please come, mom. Come. Sit down. This is our institution. Didn't you see? - Beeran! Did you understand who this is? Aishumma. That is, my mother. - I understood. That's it. This is Beeran. My friend. Whose shop is this? This is like mine only. Like yours only means? It's Haiderikka's. So it's like mine only, right? But from how you're sitting, it would seem like Haider was your worker. Stand up! No respect for elders? Beeran is like a sibling to me. How can a sibling be a worker? There's something fishy about you. Why are you covering your face? Turn this side. Turn this side, I say! Take your hand off. Take it off. There's a mark there that looks like a rotten mango! I fell from the bicycle. Your dance programme was yesterday, right? - Get lost. Beeran is a professional dancer. He has the perfect body for a dancer! This is all rusted. Is this a scrap shop? Mom, this is an antique sho.. - Aunty? What is this? An elephant with a single tusk? Who's going to buy this? Mom, shall we go home and take rest? Okay. - Come. I'll drop her home and come. - That's better. Don't do anything foolish and ruin the business. I'll sort out your dance! Mom is a traditional type. Don't mind. - I understood. Mom! - She's coming. - Yes. Shall we go, mom? Why not, son? As you say. Come. Is he the Tipu Sultan here? Oh God! Well Moideenkka, so what's the plan now? Since his mother has come, let him come for the bride-seeing ceremony once again, right? Ask him to try coming to my house for bride-seeing again! Beeran! Beeran! Hey Beeran! - Sorry Master. I won't go wrong again. Master? Oh! Aunty! - What is it, Aunty? When is tea made here? It will be at 9 AM for Hamid and me. I don't need it now. Well, it's for me. I have a habit of drinking tea at 4 AM in the morning, daily. At 4 AM? - Why? It won't go down my throat? But what about the milk? Go and buy the milk. Even the cow wouldn't have woken up at this time. Wake up the cow, milk it and bring it. Look at this lazy fellow! Oh God! Is this old hag crazy or what? Beeran! - Coming. Hamid! Oh God! Where is the switch? Look at him lying! Hamid! Get up! What is it, mom? Do you sleep until the sun rises everyday? Look! It's only 4.30 AM. Don't you go to the mosque and offer the morning prayers at all? This house lacked someone who took care of all that. We should sort all that out. Get up! Won't even apply oil on your hair! Aunty, tea. Oh! You're quite smart! You prepared it? Look at the colour. It looks nice. Awesome, right? Oh God! Is this supposed to be tea? If you tell me how to make rice & curries, I'll make them accordingly. Not already, man. Not just rice and curry, I'll teach you how to make Biriyani, chicken curry, how to sweep and clean, and everything else. That's going to be your job hereafter. Why? Will this hag climb up the coconut tree too? Hey! Hey! Where are you going? - To the dance institute. Stop the vehicle. Turn it off. Come here. Oh no! Where are you going? - For the dance rehearsal. What for? When there's so much work to do here, you want to dance? If you step out of this house without asking me, I'll kill you. Come! Come! - I want to be a Michael Jackson in the future. All the old utensils are in the attic. Wash them properly. Beeran, come for the practice in the evening. He was dancing and eating for so long, right? Let him work hard now. Keep quiet. Walk! Many are out wearing black sunglasses, to trouble people. One more artist has ceased to exist. Say that he found a good job! - Intolerable! Otherwise, how would he earn a living? Simla Tailors. Nice. I need to buy some clothes for mom. It'll pain for the coconut! Like that! You reached? - Yes. I was waiting for you. What is this, son? Some Sarees for you. There's nothing for you. This is for me. Go! Go and work. He's jealous that you didn't buy anything for him. Don't kill the coconut! Finish it fast, and I'll give you the next work then. You keep going around. Do you know anything that's happening here? What can I do? I heard that she has come. How is she? - Great! Now I know why Haiderikka got rid of her. Really? - Then what!! Hamsakka! - Yes. I was waiting for you to come. Didn't I say that she would be my mother? Shall I call her? - Yes. Mom! - Yes. She's really innocent. What is it, son? Hamsakka. He was dad's closest friend. Is he a worker turned friend, like him? No. I've been doing some business and farming and all that. I'm an old friend of Haider's. I've never heard Haider talking about such a friend. He needn't talk about everything to his wife, right? Do you know that? You keep quiet! Mom! Anyway, since your mom has come, let's go meet Moideen and proceed with that alliance? Yes, let's do that. What? We had found a bride for Hamid. That didn't happen. How would it happen? You guys went with him, right? Now no one has to go. I'll be going with him. Then, so be it. Right, Hamid? Hamsakka, what are you saying? - No, Beeran. Bye, son. Hamsakka, I'll also come with you. Here, here! Where are you going? Clean the chicken cage. It's stinking like crazy. Over here. Go, man! Hamid, don't go out in the sun. You'll get dark. Well, Hamid... Before your dad died, didn't you ask him about your wedding? Of course! So many times! And what did he say? 'O Flower, why are you searching for the breeze?' 'She will come with the perfume that has the fragrance of love' 'To embrace you, to fill you with that fragrance' What language is this? You didn't understand anything, right? - No. I also don't understand anything. What is this? Haven't you done B.A, Malayalam? It's not that I don't understand its meaning. I don't understand why he says this to me. Madness! What else? Is this the house? And, mom... Hey! Don't talk here like you talk to Beeran, okay? Are you going to see her, or is she coming to see you? Come! - Please, mom! Look who's here! Hamid? Sit down. How come you have come this way, Hamid? Well, I... Well what? I came to meet Sainaba. That's right! So you've come for a second bride-seeing ceremony? It's not that. You objected to the wedding then, because you thought I'm an orphan, right? Yes. But I am not an orphan. This is my mother. Hamid, who is this? I am her father. Why? Is there a problem? I'm not the one who should be talking about your problems. Mom! Greetings. - Greetings! Come, come! This is Sainaba. Sainaba! Do you like her? - Yes. Come here, dear. Sainaba! - Oh God! Go inside. He likes you a lot. He was in search of his mother, for you. He'll take care of you like a queen! Do you like him? I like him. I like him a lot. If you bring some woman and say that she's your mother, I should believe it? I'll break your knees. Don't get scared seeing all this. This guy will be under the ground, in 4-5 years. After that, it's your husband who should take care of you, for your whole lifetime. If that's someone who's not loving, your life would be ruined. So you decide, dear... My son is not an orphan anyway. His mind and heart is full of his love for you. Get out, you scoundrels! If you utter one more word, I'll knock your head off! Come, son! Shall I leave, dear? Calm down. I'll ask him. Ask him, Hamsakka. Ask him what happened. What happened, Hamid? Nothing happened. - Nothing happened? But I heard that Aisha created a ruckus there? It wasn't such a huge ruckus. Just a small... Small or big, ruckus is a ruckus! Son, tell me the truth. Is she really Haider's wife? What are you saying, Hamsakka? Do you think that I would bring some random person as my mother? Well, I just asked because we're seeing and hearing a lot of things. There hasn't been that much of a ruckus to see and hear! That Moideen is a real scoundrel. He'll understand only a scoundrel's language. That's why I spoke like that. And I've made her understand everything. If they like each other, I'll get them married. So it's confirmed that the wedding would happen. Do you think her dad would agree for this wedding now? I will marry her. She likes me. That's enough for me. Don't call me for company to elope, okay? You needn't come at all. Even otherwise, if the worker & dad's friend does it, would it be a wedding? His mother should get it done. I will do it. You don't worry, son. Mom is here for you. Beeran, come here. What is this, man? You can tolerate her. Not me. Come on! No. If I leave now, I can't come back. - You suffer! Well, Beeran... Ever since mom came, you've been working so hard. This isn't work. This is an old lamp, right? So? - I'm checking whether a genie would come out of it. Once the genie comes, I can eat without working & teach your mom a small lesson. Beeran. - It's been a few days since I started this. Hamsakka! Where were you? Didn't see you for 2 days. I went to Ponnani for 2 days. Ponnani? Aishumma's town? What was happening there? - Nothing. I went there to know everything. It's true that Aisha is Haider's wife. Didn't I tell you? You were just... But, son... She is not your mother. What are you saying, Hamsakka? Just because she doesn't know how to behave... how can you say that she's not my mother? Hey! Even though Aisha is Haider's wife, Haider didn't have children in their relation. Aisha can never become a mother as well. Hamsakka... What all are you saying? - Hamsakka... Well, what you heard is true? It's all true. I enquired about all this in detail at Ponnani. Moreover, Aisha has an aunt there. When I spoke to her, these are the things that I understood. He was jumping around so much! He brought her like he was bringing home the world cup! I told him that day itself not to go to Ponnani, and that it won't be his mother. But just think about it. That woman fooled him so much saying that she's his mother! Hamid, come. Sit down. Did you see this? Ponnani Biriyani. It's for you. Today is your birthday, right? How do you know that it's my birthday today? Won't the mother who gave birth to you know when your birthday is? What's wrong with this boy? Eat it and tell me how it is. What are you fiddling there for? Mix it properly and eat it. Like that! Eat. How is it? You're not my mother, right? What? You... You're not my mother, right? Well... I... It's all right. Anyone in your position, would have done the same thing. Since I've realized that neither of my dad's wives is my mother, I have a wish now. I need to know who my actual mother is. Where can I go and find her? Right? The Biriyani is superb. Excuse me. Excuse me. Do you have old gramophone records? It must be in that shelf. Go and see. What's the price of this Rafi record? Well, how much does this record of Rafi's cost? Who asked you to take that? It's not for sale. Can I get this postcard? All this will be sold together. Do you want it? Well, who is this Haider? - The priest of the temple! He is my father. Well, this is a postcard for Haider. Huh? For Haiderikka? Let me see. Look! But this is in Arabic! Let me see. Like he said, this is in Arabic. It's Arabic! This is not Arabic. It's Urdu. This is a letter written by a Begum Laila to Haider. Begum Laila? What's written in it? 'There's a good news. I'm waiting for you' (in Urdu). 'Please do come. Begum Laila' (in Urdu) Say it in a language which humans can understand. - Beeran! Can you say it in Malayalam? It's nothing else. There's a good news. I am waiting. Please come fast. From, Begum Laila. There's an address in this as well. What about this record? - Take it. How much is it? It's okay. Keep it. Okay. Thank you. Who asked you to give it for free? Look at this. Begum Laila, Qila Firdous. So what? Qila Firdous! Firdous! What? Come. Come. - Tell me what it is. What's the name of our shop? - Firdous Antiques. What is this? QIla Firdous. This is Firdous. This is Qila Firdous. Aren't they both connected? What connection? So many people are called Beeran and Hamid. It's just a name like that. This is not that. There's a real connection. You're crazy. Now go behind that. To get others beaten up! There is! This photo looks really nice, right? What are you thinking? I have to go to Lucknow. I need to know who wrote that letter to dad. I need to find her. Are you crazy? That wouldn't be your mother. Unnecessary mother craze! Chetta, do you want peanuts? Yes. - Chetta, 10 Rupees. - 2 packets. Do you think Hamsakka would let you go? I don't need anyone's permission. I am going alone. You can go there alone. I'll come with you now. Whom are you going to find out, with this post-card from Tipu Sultan's times? I will find out myself. Why are you packing bags already, for going to Lucknow day after? Is Lucknow so far away? It's not about the distance. But one should be well planned. See! Hindi-Malayalam translation handbook! Who told you that they speak Hindi in Lucknow? They don't? - They speak Konkani there. Get lost. It's Hindi only. Did you book your ticket? No. You'll have to go hanging in the general coach. Unknown place, unknown language, unknown people... So what? Won't I also have a desire to see all this? No need. You are a great professional dancer, right? You have a lot of bookings, right? You go for a lot of programmes here and get pelted a lot. There's nothing much to see in Lucknow anyway. And I heard that it's really hot over there now. I'll be a relief for you, in that heat. I don't need that much relief. So I shouldn't come? No need. Son... Oh! One mummy is here! Have some tea. You're leaving day after, right? The people of Uttar Pradesh are quite strange. You don't even know the language. And he has done only B.A., Malayalam. Beeran! This house will be full of mummies. Shall we go in the car? I didn't say it for anything else. It's a place where you'd get stuck if you are alone. I'm telling you out of my experience. Where? - At Lucknow. Have you been there? - Yes. With whom? With your dad! Really? Tell me the truth. I swear. I have gone a couple of times. Be careful, okay? Take someone with you, if you want. And, son... I will go back tomorrow. Where? Where else? To my house. No need. You needn't go back. It's not like that, Hamid. I troubled you a lot. I have to go. What is Aisha doing in the car? She is going back to her house. Huh? - Yes. Hamid will drop her at the bus stop. Thank God! We're saved! Hamsakka, I'm leaving. Beeran.. - Go carefully, son. Don't forget to drop her. What you said yesterday was true? What? That you've been to Lucknow? Of course. It's true. Not to the bus stop. Let's go straight to the railway station. Okay. So you'll be knowing Lucknow quite well, right? Of course. Then shall we go to Lucknow once again? Okay. Let's go. Whom are you looking for? No.. My boy had gone there. I can't see him. That's why. - Should I go and check? No. He will come. Where are you going? To Lucknow. Is your son working there? No. We are going there to meet someone. He must be your only son, right? I have only him in this world. Come, Hamid. Sit down. Can't you sit at one place? Are you familiar with Lucknow, Hamid? No. It's my first time. Shall we get down? See you some time. Just a minute. This is my card. If you need any help, call me. - Okay. God! Come. Oh God! Okay then. Long back, I saw Haider for the last time, when he said that he was leaving to this city from Ponnani. I had a desire in my heart since then... to come here some day, and meet Haider. I've reached this city now anyway. But he is gone. This place has an old world charm, right? Nice place. What did you say now? What? So you haven't come here earlier? Who? When? So you were fooling me? I'll send you back now. I'll book a ticket now. Say something that's going to happen, Hamid. So you lied and came till here? Sir, where do you want to go? - Get lost. You were bluffing so much! Sir, I'll drop you. - Get lost, Bhai. Get lost, man! - Stop! Stop! Wait. Where do you want to go, Madam? - Where are you going? Go back! Get down! Go! Come on, sir. - Get lost. Get down. - Stop fooling around and get in, Hamid. Sir, your mummy is calling you. - Don't think you can show off by fooling me. Your mom is calling. Please sit. Sir, please sit. Where do you want to go, sir? A room to stay... (in Malayalam). - What? A room... Ghar (House). - What? But Ghar means house. Just a minute. Oh okay. You want a Kamra (room), sir? (in Hindi) Yes, Kamala. Right? - Okay sir. Not Kamala. Vanaja. We should go around with this Hindi? - It's better than yours. Oh God! Save us! - Keep quiet, you liar! Have we reached? Sir, this is the lodge. This one? - Get down. This is your 'Kamala'. 70 Rupees. (in Hindi) How much? - 70. Thank you sir. Namaste. Where? Is it here? Is this a cave or what? Hold this! Careful! Two rooms. - Huh? I can't stay alone at an unknown place. One room is enough. - Okay. Hey! This is the room. - You told that only now, right? What room is this, Hamid? There's not even an AC. AC, it seems! Must be used to it, right? What else do you need? Oh God! The postcard is missing. Did you see it? Yes. I ate it when I felt hungry. I'll send you back right now. Yeah right. You'll send me away! You will send me away! - Where did it go? Oh no! The postcard is gone! Where? Move. Let me check. Oh God! How am I going to find her now, at this unknown place? Don't just sit here, and check in those bags. I can't find it anywhere. Then, let's go back together, right? Since you've learned Hindi, let's go around this for a couple of days and go. What is this for? To make Biriyani? Catch this. Shivettan! I can't find it. God! Did you find it? Shivetta, don't say it. One minute. Let me get a paper. Just a minute. Don't keep staring, and get me a paper. Pen? Tell me, Shivetta. Yes. It's called Mohatazam Azmat Ali Metals or Antiques or something like that. Shivetta, slowly. Mohatazam Azmat Ali. - Not that. Say it loudly, taking pauses. Mohatazam. Azmat... Ali... Mohatazam... Azmat Ali? - Antiques and metals. Okay. Thank you Shivetta. - Hey! I don't know if it's still there. It would be there. Thank you. Look. My dad's friend is here. Now we both will enquire. You stay here. Where are you going? - To meet dad's friend. You wait here. - No way. I can't stay here alone. Wherever you go, I'll come with you. Then come. Such a nuisance. Are you sure it's here? Give it to me. Let me check. Simla Tailoring House. Do you want a coat, sir? Simla Tailors. Sir, do you want something? Sir.. - Oh! Brother! Can't you hear him? He's calling you. Do you want me to show you something, sir? Has my dad come here? (in Malayalam) You want a shirt? (in Hindi) - Long back. (in Malayalam) Haider. Do you want a suit? You want to get a suit stitched? (in Hindi) I have seen this. (Malayalam) - You want a shirt? (Hindi) No. - Hamid! What are you doing here? I have seen this. Dad's... All the shops look the same here. You must be imagining things. We don't need anything. - Okay. Come. Was it the shop you were looking for? - No. I think I've seen that shop's name on dad's shirt. Tell me what you saw. You listen to me, Hamid. Pay attention. Listen to me. What are you reading? Listen to me. Oh God! Well, don't you know it by heart? Is that so? Stop there, Hamid. Don't run. Let me come. Whom are you calling? - You keep quiet. Tell me and call whomever you want. Didn't I ask you to keep quiet? Oh God! Can't reach through to Shivettan. It's switched off. - That shop's name, right? I should be blamed for bringing you here. I thought if an elderly lady is with me, things would be easier. But now... Look. Look at me. I know that name. - Please. Can you leave me alone? Is it? Okay then. Is it true that you know that shop's name? If it is? - Then tell me. I can't say it just like that. - Then? You should take me around this city. Yeah right. As if I came here to show you this city. So you can bring me for your task? Whatever you say, I won't show you around this city. You won't? - No. 'Life is a travel' 'Wandering and puckering all over, that's life' 'Life is your search, on this path of fire' 'Like flower petals in sand storms, this life speeds away' 'We have joined together as shadows' 'Where is the path, on either shore of the city?' 'We overcame pain on our own, melting into a line of Ghazal' 'A relationship that is soulful that's sought in every journey' 'Is it continuing?' 'Life is a travel' 'Wandering and puckering all over, that's life' 'Will the Minars and Mughal paintings bring us the face we are searching for?' 'Affection gives comfort to my worn out eyelashes' 'Sorrows have disappeared, like a chain of clouds' 'A compass has appeared in my inner eye' 'Life is a travel' 'Wandering and puckering all over, that's life' 'Life is your search, on this path of fire' 'Like flower petals in sand storms, this life speeds away' 'We have joined together as shadows' 'Where is the path, on either shore of the city?' 'We overcame pain on our own, melting into a line of Ghazal' 'A relationship that is soulful that's sought in every journey' 'Is it continuing?' Mohatazam Azmat Ali Antiques. Say it again! The shop we went to buy a Saree yesterday? I think it's two streets after that. Couldn't you say this earlier? Why? Aren't you going? Only you know the way, right? Come fast. Yeah right! Please come. Please come! Shall we go then? Come. - Move away! I told you, right? He won't be able to meet you. He's not well. Go! - Okay. Okay. What happened? I think he didn't understand what I said. He sent me out of there. What do we do now? - I'll go and ask. No. He will create a problem. What problem? You keep quiet, Hamid. What's the problem in asking? - Oh God! This will go out of control. - Sir. Sir! Sir! Azmat Ali.. Azmat Ali... Yes. Azmat Ali is my father. Tell me. Sign language? Even after studying B.A., I couldn't do it.. And this woman from Ponnani is going to do it? I hope it works. Sorry. I'm so sorry. - Okay. Okay. Hamid, go and bring a cab. Cab? What for? Go and get one. Who is he? Do you want to meet your dad's friend? Yes. - Then go bring one. Is it him? - Yes. Namaste. I'll come now. My son! Son... Where are we going now? Who is this? Keep quiet. Tell me who this is.. - Your dad's... What? Your dad's friend's son. Very nice man. Really? - Yes. Are we going there now? - Yes. Where? Which is this place? How many places do you know here? Don't hit.. Aunty will come! We'll deal with aunty! Uncle is here. Go inside. Run! Uncle is here! Come this way, please. No, dear... Where are you going? Keep quiet and come. I told you there itself, right? What would you talk to him? What will you ask him? His condition is quite bad. Let's go. Where? I'll come only after asking him. You want to talk to him? - Yes. Come inside. Talk to him. Why don't you also talk? - I don't want to. Dad! Dad! Someone, call a doctor. - Hamid! Chetta... I... (Broken Hindi) I am Haider's son. (Broken Hindi) I am Hamid. Yes, he understood. My... Oh God! I can't remember any Hindi when it's urgent! My... Where is my mother, Chetta? (Broken Hindi) Chetta... Chettaa... Chettaa... Chettaa.. Are you dead, Chetta? (Broken Hindi) Oh God! A person died hearing your terrible Hindi. - Dad! Chetta! Chetta! - Dad! I didn't do it. Dad! Dad! Oh God! Where's the door? - Wait. Don't go! God! Help me reach back home! - Not there. On him! Oh God! - Come! Start the car. - Open it. Move that side. - Come through the other side. These kids! Open it. - Stop playing with the kids and get in, Hamid. It hit his backside! Start the car. Let's go! Let's go. - The kids are following us. Go! Go! Go, Bhai. (Hindi) Oh God! What all should I see? Hamid... Shall we have some Biriyani and chicken curry? What do you want? Well, since a man died hearing your Hindi, shall we have some Biriyani & chicken curry? Chicken curry & Biriyani, it seems. What is this? Nice. Hamid, look here. A bridegroom. It's a wedding. You should get on a horse like this for your wedding. I don't know if my wedding would ever happen. And you want a horse? - Let's go. Hamsakka. What's happening, Hamid? Have you found her? Nothing, Hamsakka. Tell me the matter. I'm not speaking too much. I'll tell you in person once I reach there. What happened, son? I am an orphan, Hamsakka. That's all you need to know now. I'll call you. I'm hanging up. When am I going to sit with you happily and have a Biriyani next? I'm full. Hamid... Hey Hamid! Get up. Freshen up & get ready quickly. What for? We need to go to a place. Make it fast. I'll wait downstairs. Don't lie down again. Come on, get ready fast. Where is he running to? So you took my postcard? Yes. Why? You should get out of here right now. Get into the car. - I don't want to hear anything. You should go back in the next train. Don't you want to find your mom? I'll find her alone. You needn't bother about that. - Get into the car. Get in, I say! Him and his questions! Whom are we going to kill this time! Give me that postcard. Let me ask the way. Give it to me. Isn't this a love letter? If someone sees it, what would they think about my dad? - Your dad? He romanced so many, married couple of times and is dead now. What more can people think about your dad now? So it's fine? - Totally fine. Give it. Read this, sir. (in Hindi) Hindi? It's a very old photo. Mehmoodabad. - Then go. (in Hindi) Mehmoodabad? So far? Why? This car can't go far? (in Hindi) No. It does, Madam. - Then go. (in Hindi) I knew it when I saw you talking at that shop. Where did you learn Hindi from? Your book? That translation handbook! I learned from that. Well, who are you actually? Haider's wife Aisha. I am no one to you, right? Madam... Sir, sugarcane juice. Healthy and tasty. Is she fooling me? Would the guy who sells old swords and pots have any sense? Did you say anything now? Drink the juice, Hamid. Oh God! He has ears of a snake. Sir, you have to go straight and turn left. Oh! I have to turn left? Is anything going to happen, bro? - One minute, sir. Calm down, Hamid. Let him ask. You sit here. What is it, Bhai? We have to go straight and turn left. - Okay, let's go. Can't see anyone here. Didn't you say that he knows all the routes? - Yes. Is there any other route, Chetta? (in Malayalam) What is it, Bhai? (in Hindi) Madam, looks like we took a wrong route. He has a doubt whether we've lost our way slightly. Slightly? We've reached some other country. Have you taken your passport? Go and ask someone, Bhai. - I'll ask, Madam. Sir, we've been looking for Begum's mansion and can't find it. Got it? - Yes, Madam. Yeah right. He'll get it now. Keep quiet. Come on, walk! Isn't this the place? - Yes. I think this is the house. Shall we go in? - Yes. I think there's no one here. Calm down, Hamid. There he is. Who are you? What are you doing here? Isn't this Begum Laila's house? (in Hindi) What Begum? There's no Begum here. Dances used to happen here 25 years back. Now nothing happens here. Come on, get out of here. Where is she now? How do I know where she is? Come on, get going. - Okay. We will leave. So Begum Laila doesn't stay here? Should I repeat it to you again? Get out. Come. Don't get beaten to death by him. So it's not this also? Get out! God! Get out. - Wait. - Where do they come from? - Hey! Come. - You wait there. What is it? - Is this the house? Yes. Tell me the truth. What's your intention? Is it my fault that Laila is not there? How are you so sure that this is the house? How are you so sure that this is not the house? My biggest mistake was bringing you along with me. Then.. - If I was alone... If you were alone? - If I was alone, I'd have shown this address to the driver & come here earlier. I wouldn't have had to go around the city with random people. Can you speak two words without stuttering? When you said four words of Hindi, a man died! I know how to talk. I'm well educated. Not like you. I wasn't talking about your B.A., Malayalam. Do you know how to speak Hindi? Hindi! Who told you that I am B.A. Malayalam? You didn't do B.A. in Hindi, right? To say all this, what have you studied? I may not be so educated. But there are some good lessons that your dad taught me, in my mind. One of that is this Hindi. Yeah right. As if my dad's job was to give you tuitions. What do you know about your dad? If you talk about my dad... Before he became your dad, Haider was my husband. Do you know that? That's my doubt. I don't understand why my dad married you. I was a really beautiful girl. And not like your Sainaba. Then why did my dad ditch you? Go and ask your dad! Hello! - Hamid, it's me. Shivan Kutty. Shivettan. Tell me, Shivetta. Which is this number? - My old phone went missing. Save this number. - Okay. I'll save it. What's happening there? - I'm right outside the house. I just have to go inside. What I said was helpful, right? That's enough. Of course. - Awesome! Did you go alone? - No. There's someone with me. I found her from the train. Anyway, things are all happy, right? - I am really happy. Okay then. I'll call you. Okay Chetta. Look at this, sir. Alambagh. This is close by, Madam. - Is it? Then let's go. - Okay. Where are you going? - To Ponnani. Are you coming? Get inside, Hamid. Let's go, Bhai. Where are we going now? - Faster, Bhai. I need to know where we're going this time. Keep quiet, Hamid. 'Keep quiet, Hamid' 'Calm down, Hamid. Go up, Hamid. Come down, Hamid'. 'The crown is there, Hamid. The crown is here, Hamid' Well, are you an old CID? - If I am? If you are... If you are.. nothing.. but I need to know where we're going. I.. Madam, can you see that blue door? That's the place. This is the house. 'Get down, Hamid'. Right? Get down. Is nobody home? Who are you? (in Hindi) Is Raghavan Master inside? (in Malayalam) Oh! You are Malayalis? Raghavettan has gone out. Please come in. Is he a Nair? He's a Professor. You come! Yes. Professor Nair. Phew! Nice rhythm. Can you hear it? Dance. I think they are dancing. 'Keep quiet, Hamid'. Right? Radha... Look who's here! Aisha and Hamid? - Yes. Is your trip over? Yes. It's over. - Almost. Whom should I believe? The mother or the son? The mother. Radha, didn't you get tea for them? I'll go to the kitchen. - No. Sit down. It's okay, Master. She needn't take the trouble alone. Shall I help you? - Why did you come here? I'd have brought it there. I like working in the kitchen. I'll make it. - No. It's okay. I'll do it. Nice rhythm. Dance. It's dance, right? It's from that dance school. It's a local branch of a big dance school in Lucknow. Students come even from far away places. Begum's dance school. It's run by a famous old dancer of Lucknow. What is her name? Laila... Is it Begum Laila? - How do you know that? Well, I felt like I've heard it in an old Hindi film. Where is her house? It's from dad's time. His shop. - Hamid. Come outside. - Where? We'll be right back. Aren't you having tea? - Where to? No. We'll have it once we're back. Come. Come, I say. You'll come only if you hear the whole story? - What's the matter? Hey! If you won't say 'Keep quiet, Hamid', shall I ask you something? Where are we going now, actually? Why should we waste time unnecessarily? Why don't we go back? We're going to meet Begum Laila. Why? Don't want to go? This is house of the person we were searching for, all these days. I left all that. I don't want to find anyone now. My dear Hamid... It's been a long time since I joined you, right? I can understand what's in your heart, a little bit. Go. Then come. Come. Get down. I'm not coming. You go alone. Why? Whom would you introduce me as? That's not necessary. Go. Me, alone? Didn't we come here so that you won't end up alone? So, I should go alone? You should. What happened, sir? Begum Laila? Please come inside, sir. Go ahead. You are? Begum Laila? Tell me your name. Your name. - Hamid. Hamid. Please come inside. Please come in. Please sit. I'll be right back. Sir... Come upstairs. This way... Please sit down. I am Hamid. (in Hindi) Haider's son. (in Hindi) You are Haider's son? (in Malayalam) Yes. Malayalam? How do you know Malayalam? Haider taught me. (in Malayalam) How do you know my father? He was a very dear friend. It's been 27 years since we met last. How is he? Where is he now? Dad is no more. It's been a while. Now... Why have you come here? You are his old friend, right? I came to inform you. Have you come alone, Hamid? No. How did you know about me? You look really beautiful. Like my mother. I am busy now. It's my son's wedding. How many children do you have? My son will reach now. Hamid... You're leaving, right? Hello. Beeran... Are you planning to settle in Lucknow looking for your mother? No plans of coming back? No, dude. I am coming back. By the way, there's a good news. Beeran... Let's talk later. Dude, listen to me. If you hear this, you'll be really happy. Sainaba's dad? Moideenikka. He died! What? Can't believe it, right? So hear it once again. He's dead! He is dead? It's the best time for you to marry her. I had seen her. She asked for you. Who? Who asked for me? Dude, Sainaba. Should I tell her anything? As a message from you? Hey! Hamid! Hello! Hamid, can you hear me? Hey! Why are you silent? I'll call you later, Beeran. Sir, shall we go back to Lucknow? Yes. Son, Hamid... Haven't you met your mother yet? You're back? What happened there? So it's not this one too? When I heard that name... I got out with you, in a sudden excitement. It's okay. You don't worry. We will find her. I am with you, right? Your mother is here somewhere. True. My mother is right here. Bhai.. - Yes. Stop. - Okay. God! I wish I had gotten the form of my 10th grade exams right now. Name : Hamid Haider. Father's name : Mohammed Haider Ali. House name : Mehfil. Mother's name : Hamid! Shouldn't we go? Come here. I'll show you something. What happened to you? Come! Come. What is it, here? Look over there. Why? Haven't you seen a sunset earlier? I've seen it. But I haven't seen it with my mother. What? I have seen a sunset. But I haven't seen it with my mother. Am I your mother? - Yes. Who told you so? My dad told me. Leave me. Why? You don't believe me? When your dad bid farewell to me and left, I knew that he would never come back. Yet, I waited for him in vain. I was scared to die, because there was no one to conduct my funeral. But when you came looking for me, I realized that... It was you whom I was waiting for, all this while. I am your mother. You know why? Some lady gave birth to you once. But with my heart, I've given birth to you a hundred times. Who else do I have other than you in this world? What is this, mom? With this setting sun which is shining bright, and these ripe wheat fields as witnesses, I'm declaring that... If I have a mother in this world, that's Aishumma. That's Aishumma. That's my Aishumma alone. So you have actually done B.A. Malayalam? B.A. Malayalam is not such a bad degree. Let's have some Chicken curry and Biriyani then. What say? We can. Did you know something? Like you said, Sainaba's dad died. God! That rascal is gone? When? Get in. I'll tell you. Hamid... If this bride-seeing ceremony goes well, my opinion is that Beeran's wedding should also be done alongside Hamid's wedding. That's the best thing to do, right? Hey! Beeran! She's a beautiful girl. You should go and impress her strongly. I've been waiting for a long time, so that our weddings can happen together. I'll do that. Well, Hamsakka... When I go to see the girl, would they create a problem saying I don't have any relatives, and that I'm also an orphan? Why should they create a problem? If they ask you, tell them that I am your mother. What say? - What else do you need? Don't be surprised. You are my son only. Hey! He is crying. Sheesh! Beeran became all senti! - Get lost. Sheesh! - Shall we go, mom? - Let's go. Hey! I've told them that I need chicken curry & Biriyani if the wedding is fixed. Go fast. I'm kidding!
