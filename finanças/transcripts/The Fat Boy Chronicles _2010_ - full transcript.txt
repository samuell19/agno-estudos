[simultaneous chattering] High school, noun, A secondary school, especially, in the United States, Usually including grades 9 through 12 And serving students from about 14 to 18 years of age. Typically, high school's offer college preparatory classes For advance students, General education classes for average students And remedial courses for those who are struggling. Hey! Hey. [whispering] [bell rings] Good morning, everyone, and welcome to high school. Here's the syllabus. Now, we're gonna take about 15 minutes And go through it, So you don't have to worry about asking any questions right now. Okay. Yes? This says we have to keep a diary. Yes, a journal. It is required. It's 10 of your grade. A journal about what? About anything. You can write about the day you're having, A conversation you had with your mom or your sister, Whatever you want. And I'll only read the pages that you want me to read. If you write something that's too personal And you don't want me to read it, Just fold the page over and write "please do not read this" And I won't read it. Let's get it started. The first part of the syllabus is called the requirements. Now don't throw your syllabus away Because you need to refer to it throughout the course, okay? Thuman. Venquist. Winterpock. Here, sir. You have five minutes from the bell to get ready, got it? [whistles] [whistles] You've got football game last night? Yeah, dude. How was school today? Did you make any new friends? No, I didn't make any friends... Guess I wasn't cool enough. Hey, Mrs. Pope, I'm the diet challenged kid who sits in the front seat, Probably bigger now than I was this morning Because your class is right after lunch. I wanna sit in the back, So you don't have to constantly hear, "we can't see around Jimmy." And I don't get teachers. Why do you guys pile it on the first day of school? Can't you let us get use to the idea that Summer Is really over? Three half pages a week is tough. Why don't you just ask us to write The great American novel and say it's due in June? New school sucked. Except for leaving Paul I'm glad we moved. And then, I'm in high school, Maybe things will be different, At least, I hope so. I don't know anyone here except for Nate. Went to elementary school together. Didn't think I'd ever see him again. My sister, she goes here ,too. She's okay with the new school. She already knows people here. I did sit with the blonde girl at lunch, She seems nice. And Robb, the quarterback, he's in my PE class. There's my half page. I still don't know why we have to do This stupid journal. [simultaneous chatters] I ride the same bus as you. Oh, yeah? Where do you sit? I sit in the back. Well, I'm gonna get a dessert, The cookies here are the best. Do you have to be so noisy? Do you have to be so ugly? Mom! Be nice. Have fun on the bus. Are you sure Jimmy can't ride with you? Mom, there's only so much room. Besides, he takes up two seats. Jessica! [simultaneous chatters] [laughs] You're in here? Yeah, I was in Smith's class. I heard he's easy. That's why I changed. I have to sharpen my pencil. I have to keep a sharp pencil for my notes. We have to do our journal in pen, though. I hate using pen. Journal? Oh, we have to keep this stupid journal. Wasting trees, I say. I like journals. I can say what I really feel. I like to write poems and use big words. I think I'm euphemistic. Oh, I'm sorry. [bell rings] All right, everyone, get out your homework. This is Roger Presley reporting from the intersection Of brown and Madison, the last known location Of Kimberly Taylor, a 17 year old from Hanover. According to friends and family, She was on her way home from band practice Walking through this neighborhood When she disappeared. I was watching that. Let's find her. Who her? The missing girl. Then we could be famous. You're kidding, right? Are you kidding? It would solve all of our problems. It would get me out of the house. I've got enough stuff to do already. Think about it, dude. Soon she'll have turned up and we'll have missed our Chance. Paul and Jimmy, teen dicks. That means detectives. I'm not stupid. [music] Right now I'm sitting in my room writing my half page. Today, Paul came over to eat pizza and watched TV. I still think this journal is a waste of time. I mean, who cares about my boring life. [bell rings] [simultaneous chatters] Hey, stupid! Yeah, you! Don't you know? This is our spot. I didn't know. Hey, cutie! Is this your locker room? Look at that chest? It's bigger than Whitney's. [laughs] So are you, like, a d-cup? [whistles] What's going on in here? Nothing, coach, Just chatting with the new kid. Well, hurry up, get dressed. Hey, guys, I was thinking, Maybe we should change our mascot To the big, round, blueberries. [laughs] [music] All right, everybody, let's make sure We've got our homework out. We're going to be studying the chapter On elements and compounds, Everybody needs to know where we are. Hey, Jimmy, did you do your homework last night? I need to make sure I got mine right. Well, hand it over. I wanna make sure. Yeah man? Mr. Larson, does this honestly look right to you? Yeah, that looks fine. You're doing great. Okay, you're all set. Winterpock? What's the definition of a compound? Uh, compounds, um-- [stutters] it's, uh, when... Two elements combine. [imitates Jimmy] did you do your homework? Yes, sir. Where is it? Did your dog eat it? No, sir, it's, um, I just don't have it with me. Well, when you get it back, I don't want it. You can keep it. But, anyway, let's not forget Monday, we've got a lab, okay? Bring all your stuff-- I wasn't finished. Winterpock! Turn around, you knucklehead. That's a detention. I will see you after school. All right. Let's go. Let's go over the homework For everybody that actually brought Theirs to school with them. I couldn't rat her out, mom. She copied your homework and you protected her. Why? I don't know. She's my friend. Well, you need better friends. She's really cool. She'd probably just got home late From cheerleading practice or something. Well, okay, I guess you can't rat out your friends. [music] [laughs] A dark cloud still hangs over this community. It's been one month since Kimberly Taylor disappeared And one week since her body was found in the wooded area 20 Miles from here. Hey, hon, finished your homework? Yeah. The search in the community For young Kimberly Taylor's killer As the community anxiously awaits... I sure hope they find her killer. I can't imagine how her mother feels. ...Twenty or even thirty pounds? If so then we have a new Product just for you. Introducing thermo-slim, a revolutionary new Weight loss product guaranteed To take inches off... Come on. All right. Hi Jimmy, I'm Dr. Jeffords. It says here we're doing your annual checkup. Yeah, I guess. Playing any sports this year? Um, no, But I'm in the jazz band. See what I'm going to do is check your lungs. What I want you to do is take in a deep breath for me. Breathe in. Breathe out. In. Out. It sounds good there. Jimmy, do you ever find yourself getting winded Or tired or short of breath For no reason? Um, not really. Maybe a little. Really? How are things at school? Everything at school okay? School's okay. Well, you know, I guess things could be a bit better. Yeah? How's so? Well, it's kinda hard to make friends. Yeah, school can be tough. Jimmy, it says here that you're 14. Yes, sir. You're 188 pounds. Well, I guess, I'm a bit overweight. The kids in school, Except for a few and my teacher, They say things, Mean things. Jimmy. I was picked on a lot when I was a kid. The jocks and the cool kids, They were always teasing me. And I didn't know how to deal with the pain. And so, I'd eat. I'd eat when I was happy, I eat when I was sad, Even when I was bored. And no matter what, I was always left feeling Empty. Do you know what I'm trying to say? I'm sure you are a great kid. Obesity is a fat kid. Truth is if you don't lose the weight, It will never stop. And believe me, that will be the least of your troubles. I promise you that. Jimmy, what are you doing? Jimmy, what is wrong? Jimmy! I'm sick of being fat and everyone making fun of me! I hate school. I have no friends! And I hate you for having all this junk in the house. I wanna lose weight! Jimmy. [music] What? You sure write a lot. I have a lot to say, don't you? Sometimes. But you always fold them down, so Mrs. P can't read them. So what's the point? I read them. Well, do you write about guys? Alright, everyone, time to turn in your journals. I wrote about how teachers always give tests on Friday. They think their class is the only one. We do? [announcer] attention, at the bell, All students should report to the gym for the pep rally. [music] Please don't read this page. Last Friday when I was sitting in the pep rally, Might as well been alone in my room. Usually, at school, I'm invisible, Except when someone wants to laugh at me. Not then. That's when I'm really in spotlight. And when they say things about me, The more I think that what they say might be true... That I am a loser, That I don't matter. And if I wasn't here, no one would even notice. Don't they know that I'm a good person, That I'd love to be one of them? To hear the cheers because I'm on the team. Because I'm popular. They have everything, but they make fun of me, The fat kid. All I can hear is Robb talking about my chest. Apparently, he comes to school to play football And to make my life miserable. When mom came in to say good night, I had to pretend I was asleep, So she wouldn't see me crying. [music] [rock music playing] Hey! You need a jogging buddy? Come on, let's go. Run! don't you think don't you think So you talked to her once and you like her? Right on! Hey, you want some advice from the master of love? Yeah, but do you know someone like that? Hey, he's kicking your butt right now. You suck! What does she look like? Well, she has a black sweater, Black shirt, black shoes-- What are you in love with Darth Vader? So is she, you know-- What? You know, big, like you? Actually, no. She's actually thin. Probably too thin, though. That could be a problem. Even for the master of love. [voice from pa] attention, a reminder to all students-- Hey, Sable, did you see the news? About that girl? That's where I used to live. Maybe she just ran away, Maybe she got so sick of everyone That she had to leave or she knew-- Alright, um, So are you going to the game tonight? Football's for Neanderthals. Yeah, but it's homecoming. Allen will be there. We could see the freshman float. Makes it even worse. [cheers] Hey, Mrs. Pope, guess what? Sable went with me and Allen to the homecoming parade. The theme was "reach for the stars," But it should've been "let's boo and terrorize the freshman float." I almost caught one of those little footballs That cheerleaders throw into the crowd And I met the mayor. And even though Sable doesn't really like football, I still think she's pretty cool. [cheers] You know, if you ever wanna talk about being euphemistic, I'm a good listener. That's so sweet. Hey, Mrs. Pope, today was pretty good. Man, I'm so-- Did you see the game last night? Fingers hurt from playing guitar hero. I have a lot to say, but-- Mr. Larson is crazy. Don't tell him that, though. Please don't read this page. Man, I tell you I wish I was an only child. Hey, Mrs. Pope, please don't read this page. I feel alone. I am alone. I wish I could be invisible. Does anyone care? They have everything. I am invisible. Hey, Mrs. Pope, today was sunny. What's the point of playing the game If there are cheat codes. I don't ever understand Sable. I have to study. Today was hot. Hey, Mrs. Pope, please don't read this page. Am I the only one who feels this way? Please don't read this page. Please don't read this page. Please don't read this page. Please don't read this page. Kids make fun of me. School sucks. Does it ever get better? Those kids are hard-- Please don't read this page. School sucks. I don't feel like writing. School sucks. School sucks. School sucks. Hey, Mrs. Pope, I made an a. It was cold. I was up all-night studying. Hey, Mrs. Pope, today was rainy. Hey, Mrs. Pope-- [guitar playing] Did you jog this morning? I've lost 14 pounds. Really? That is great, Jimmy. Alright. I have to head to the airport. I'll see you guys in a few days, hmm? This is gonna be fun. Alright. And, yes, this counts as a test grade. Alright. And look, you can work with a partner, You can work by yourself Or if you're schizophrenic, you can do both. Yes? Are these traps new? Yeah, most of them. Some of them might be leftover From last year's cafeteria catastrophe. Oh! I'm just kidding. Alright. So anyway, everybody gets a new mousetrap. Alright. Farthest car wins. And you've got to be careful, these things are dangerous. Jimmy, can I be your partner? No! Oh! [bell rings] So how about this weekend? Friday night? I'll think about it. Hey, Jimmy, coach says he needs a trainer for the team. What do you say? You wanna give it a shot? Okay. After school, you gotta come down to the locker room And meet some of the guys. Why? Uh, you got to talk to coach, see what you have to do. It won't take long. Friday? Maybe. Watch this. Okay, let's go. Go! Yeah! Whoo! Go! Go! [clapping and cheering]] Whoo! Yeah! That's right.

[crying] Hello, Winterpock. There's no one here. Hang in there. Maybe they'll grow up one day. I did. You keep doing what you're doing. Don't think I haven't noticed. You'll be alright. Come on. Let's go. How could you do that? It was funny. And Jimmy's okay with it. How would you know? When have you ever been made fun of? You didn't have to do that. Yes, I did. And I will never go out with a jerk like you! I think I'm gonna invite Sable to church. Yeah, man, I wanna check her out. Okay, okay, no checking. So how's school? Uh, you know, not much different. My teachers suck. Someone told me you've got suspended for a couple of days. Who? Well... Well, what? Did you get suspended. Man, bet your mom freaked. My mom? She was so drunk when the principal called That she didn't even remember by the time I got home. I left every morning And acted like I was going to school. Whoa! My mom would kill me. Twice.

Anyways, um... What--what's it like to kiss a girl? Hey, I read this. Guess what they're gonna call you? I know. I saw it on page 5. Can't wait. You know, I think my dad might lose his job. Oh, man. Yeah. Looks like I might have to live with my uncle. He's even a bigger drunk than my dad. The good news is he lives close here. Cool. You know, they still haven't found out who killed that girl.

A new student needs some help. And since you're the best in here, I didn't think you'd mind. Who, sir? I don't see anybody new. How about this, Robb Thuman, star quarterback. Oh, no. Alright, everybody, turn to page 85. Why wouldn't you play Romeo? I don't know. Maybe because I hate getting up in front of everybody. That's why. Why do you cut yourself? Why do you think I cut myself? 'cause I like it? 'cause I enjoy it? I do 'cause I'm dying inside. Does that answer your question? You think you're the only one? I went to a party last weekend, And everybody said I had a bigger chest Than most of the girls there. How do you think that made me feel? Now everybody in school knows about it. Don't talk to me about your problems. At least you're not fat. You don't get it, do you? You think it's all about the way you look? Let me tell you something, Jimmy Winterpock. There are way worse things than being fat! Some of us have scars that can't be healed By running around the block. Grow up, Jimmy! You think you're the only one with problems? Everyone's gonna forget about that stupid party. I thought you were cool. That you got it. Boy, was I stupid. "the pile of guts was a black blob of flies That buzzed like a saw. After a while, these flies found Simon. Gorged, they alighted by his runnels of sweat and drink. They tickled under his nostrils And played leapfrog on his thighs. They were black and iridescent green And without number; And in front of Simon, The Lord of Flies hung on his stick and grinned. At last, Simon gave up and looked back. Saw the white teeth and dim eyes, the blood, And his gaze was held by that ancient, Inescapable recognition." and on and on the road she goes secret even time don't know and time and time her paramour will take his weight in gold Oh, no. And nobody knows where he is? Okay, we will. Who is it? Jimmy, I've got some bad news. Paul's dad is dead. He committed suicide. Oh, my God! And Paul's gone? Yeah. Wh--where's Paul? Nobody knows. [music] it's better to be born lucky It's okay if you read this, Mrs. Pope. My friend Paul is gone. Nobody knows where he is. He ran away after his dad died. They never got along but I know how much Paul wanted his dad To love him. He used to tell me how they were gonna go To a baseball game together. But they never did. Now, they never will. There is a quote one day, "nothing endures, not a tree Not love, not death or violence." Now I know what it means. And how it feels. The world is different, And I'm worried about my friends. There's nothing I can do about it. [knocks] Hey, buddy. How about we go for a run? It might make you feel better. I don't know. Not right now. Well, I'm here if you want to. Um-- Why don't you invite Sable to church on Sunday? ... I left my heart but a picture of Jesus that covers a crack in the wall Alright, look. This doesn't change anything. You get bragging points and I get to pass This stupid class. Well, that's a good start. Come on. I don't want everybody knowing I'm getting help from you. Oh! Uh! Who am I kidding? I'm not going to college. Listen, we all have something that's hard, That we'd rather not deal with. I don't need you lecturing me. I'll go home if I want that. Who are you to tell me things are hard? What? We're not that different, you and I. And you need me. You need to pass math. Alright, then. Let's go coach Winterpock. Give me question 1. We've got a call from Paul's grandmother. He's in Colorado. Colorado? Headed west probably. Well, that's Paul. He always said he would try to get as far away as possible. But there's been an accident. Paul's been hurt. We don't know how badly. He was my best friend. Hey. He still is pal. And I'm sure you're still his, too. And he's gonna need you more than ever when he comes home In a couple of weeks, okay? Come here. Let's go. Hey, Robb. What do you want? Uh, how's it going? Fat freshmen are not allowed to talk to me. How are things going on with Robb? Great. He's getting better. bring me down... my girlfriend tried to tell me... she said boy you better make a plan ...Cause I won't let you bring me down on and on and on and on and on... Failure is an inevitable part of life. It does not mean that we are defeated forever Or that we should give up. Failure is a mystery, And it is even divine. It humbles us and it makes us more compassionate to others. It often is God's way of leading us to our true selves Or to a better position in our lives. How often have you heard someone say, "it's a good thing I didn't get that job or promotion Or scholarship or whatever?" Some experiences that seem like tragedies at the moment Lead us to opportunities that we would have not found otherwise. Amen! There is no way that we can know and love God Except through the discovery of human intimacy and community. We must open our souls To the love that humanity offers. Everyday, Every hour, Every moment is sacred... I heard about Paul? And we must embrace life... Where have you been? As if it is both fragile and strong. I had to get better. [preacher continues] He will turn our failures into success. I know you tried to be a good person And people picked on you because of how you look. [preacher continues on] You're the bravest person I know, Jimmy Winterpock. And we are all tested. But how you respond will define your life. Giving up is easy. Getting back up is hard. (all) Amen! For five months, the boyfriend was the primary suspect. However, recent evidence has led police to arrest Kimberly's councilor, Jeffrey Hickman. I know it was you. What? Starr. I'm sorry. I know. Winterpock! Hey, we've got a test today in math. Yeah, I know. Can we go to the library during homeroom? With me, a fat freshman? Yeah, with you, fat freshman. Yeah, well, I don't think I can be seen with a dumb jock. I'm just kidding. Oh, really? Really. Alright, I'll see you in the library. If I profane with my unworth-- Unworthiest hand this holy shrine, The gentle sin is this, My lips, two blushing pilgrims ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss-- [laughs] I quit.

Thank you. It wasn't just me. [sighs] Still want that ride to the hospital? Yeah, that'd be great. Hey, Mrs. Pope, I can't believe this is my last journal entry for the year. I remember complaining about writing in a journal. Boy, was I wrong. It helped me make it through some tough days. Writing my thoughts on paper has made it easier for me To say things to people. Yesterday, at church youth group, I was asked to talked about how I lost weight this year. What I ended up talking about was How my whole world has changed. Looking back, this has been an amazing year. Not all of it has been good. Actually, a lot of it wasn't. There were times when I almost lost hope But I'm thankful I have my church, I have my friends And I have my family. In the end, I realized it wasn't Just about losing weight. It was about figuring out who I am. And I learned how to figure that out myself. When you're finished with my journal, I'd like to get it back. My kids might get a kick out of knowing their dad Was a big fat kid. Anyway, thanks for everything, Mrs. Pope. Sincerely your student, Jimmy Winterpock. I couldn't say what was in my head when you said that I was... it was still so new... supermagical... I first tried to walk over... one two three four... still I didn't know what to do just hung around ...Told me you were over it and I... ...Waiting for a moment to come... I feel so dumb and tired... that's how Summer went... ---the end---
