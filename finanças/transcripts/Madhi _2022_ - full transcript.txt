A vehicle in my hands. A woman I love beside me. This is every young man's dream. It's mine as well. This story began with such a dream. But I don't know in which direction it's going to pull me towards. Even then, I cannot resist moving forward. [mobile ringing] Hello? Hello? Madhu! Hmm! Madhu talk to me. Madhu! Are you there? Hello... Madhu! Abhi, today is my wedding night. Abhi! [door opens] Abhi! Dear! It's getting late for the auspicious moment, come fast. MADHI PREMA - VIRAHAM - PRALAYAM RAJAHMUNDRY. 2015 Hello, Chikki? Ram took a girl inside with him. Abhi and me are sitting outside. Chikki, you know me very well. Don't say that, Chikki. I am going to be hurt. What else is happening? Why don't you send me a selfie? Did you really sleep at 10 o'clock last night? Brother, what's going on? When I talk to you, I always lose track of time. You are always like this. You are always suspicious. [knocks on door] What else is happening? What? Why are you looking at me like that? What happened? Nothing. Even though I am outside, I am quite scared. And, you were inside. Why aren't you scared? These sorts of things usually scare the people outside, rather than the ones inside. How do you know that? That's because I was inside. -Buddy, I want to get inside as well. -Hey! What do you mean? Not that way. I meant with another girl. How long have you been feeling this way? Of course, I would already be feeling this way! That's what I've been wondering. Finally, you started feeling this way. You know my score, right? It's quite a lot. If you hook up with every girl in the neighbourhood, what would be left for me to do? Are you jealous? Fine. Let's hook you up with someone. Do you have any sense? Where did you take the bike and dump it? You know how well I take care of the bike, don't you? Thank goodness he isn't hurt. Why are you making a fuss? When I said no to him riding a bike, you nag me into giving him the bike. -Did you see how he's damaged it? -This man! I am talking about our son and you keep talking the bike. Where are you going? -Constantly chiding him! -Nowhere! Still as arrogant as ever. And he's grown like a donkey! [vehicle honks] Buddy, remember my neighbour Madhu? Abhi is here. Yes, yellow-colored scooty, studies in Pragati college. -She looks good, right? -They are talking about some girl. You just noticed her now? She lives in the house adjacent to yours, right? Haven't you noticed her until now? No, I've been noticing her right from when we were kids. But she seemed different yesterday. Apparently, she seemed different. It seemed like I was seeing her for the first time. Some change. She hasn't changed. Your gaze has changed. She's still the same. If she is that beautiful, I am sure she already has a boyfriend. We always assume that if the girl is beautiful, she must already have a boyfriend. -Hmm... -But that's not true. Honestly, beautiful girls are usually single. That's cause everyone who looks at them and assumes the same thing about them. That's true. Shall I try to court her? Tell me the truth. You haven't noticed her all these days? I did notice her. But yesterday was the day, something sparked in me. Oh! -Remember Shailu, my neighbour. -We are at Ram's place. She is a friend of Madhu. -Remember his neighbor Shailu? Yes, Shailu. What's going on, buddy? The entire place is covered with leaves. We are right in front of Shailu's place. Don't shout. A while ago, it was very sunny. But now, it's tolerable. We are around the corner. Hey, I am here, aren't I? You hold on. Excuse me? Ball? Throw an in swinger. The length is important. The fielding is mine. Hello? Hello, excuse me? Ball? Thank you. Thank you. Ball... Bunty, why are you hitting every ball into the house? What can I do, sister? He's made the rules that way. What rules? If the ball is hit into that aunt's house, it's two runs. It the ball is hit into uncle's house, it's three runs. If it hits the wall of your house, it's four runs. And if the ball is hit into your house, it's six runs. That is the reason why I've been hitting every ball in the direction of your house. These are the last two balls in the over. Okay. This time, try the out swinger. Okay. Hit it. Abhi, wait. Why do you always laugh looking at me? I don't know why but looking at you makes me crack up. Do I look that funny to you? No, no. Nothing like that. You just crack me up, that's all. "You are a warm dream that reached my eyes." "My hot-blooded youth is being lulled into this rhythm." "Your smile hangs about the corner of your lips and pulls me close." "The beat of sweat on your neck cools me down and kills me." "All of my heart keeps following you around." "It keeps playing hide and seek." "You are a warm dream that reached my eyes." "Shall I weave your reality like in your dreams?" "My hot-blooded youth is being lulled into this rhythm." "Shall I give you company and make you shiver?" "Today is nothing like yesterday. This chapter is quite good." "The time is going to bless this story. It's going to stand still for us." "Won't it keep listening to our secrets?" "All your gazes lead to my charms." "I am watching you and I keep playing you." Madhu, give me your number? We are neighbours. You can talk to me directly. Actually, the phone wasn't invented to keep in touch with loved ones. It was to make sure that people who are close to each other, deepen their relationship. Well, I have your father's number. Do you want me to call his number? I have your number. I'll call you. Bye. "let's get closer when our hands brush against each other." "Shall I become a couple!" -"Let me be the wetness on your cheek" -"Shall I become affectionate!" "You are the beauty that makes my heart spring with desire" "And it can never stop because of you." -"When your heart starts aching," -"Shall I appear in front of you?" -"Come closer and lay in my lap." -"Shall I settle down there?" "The time moves around us like a story that keeps running" "Shall I get excited as well?" "You are a warm dream that reached my eyes." "Shall I weave your reality like in your dreams?" "My hot-blooded youth is being lulled into this rhythm." "Shall I give you company and make you shiver?" "Today is nothing like yesterday. This chapter is quite good." "The time is going to bless this story. It's going to stand still for us." "Won't it keep listening to our secrets?" "All your gazes lead to my charms." "I am watching you and I keep playing you." What happened? Go. Where were you all these days? You came up to me so suddenly... Earlier, you would never speak to me this way. I wonder why, even I don't know. What do you like about me? I mean, is it because you like my heart or you just like the way I look? What are you talking about? I chased after you because I find you good looking. If not, what would I know about you? I mean, I am getting to know you by and by. You are a good girl. Stop your OA. OA? Over action. Tell me what you like about me? -Well... How do I tell you... -Tell me. I like your back. What? My back? Don't try to look. You cannot see it. What do you mean you like my back? Are you crazy? Well, in the beginning, I used to watch your back. I observed it a lot. Your back is really good, you know? Bye! Bye! Buddy, I need to use your place. Really? -When? -Tomorrow. Chikki, Abhi finally got the girl to go out with him. And he made Ram to sit outside. It's his time to shine. What else, Chikki? [knocks on door] Chikki, stay on the line. I hear the sound of the door. Ram is opening the door. Abhi and that girl came out. -Bye. -Bye. Buddy, you didn't come out of it. -Chikki... -Maybe never and ever. What could you have possibly done to get to this state? For the first time ever, I feel completely different. What did you do? When she came in, my heart began to beat faster. For a moment, I didn't understand anything. After that, slowly I went towards her. She smells so good. And that drove me in a high greater than a cigarette ever did. I went and hugged her tightly. After that, even I didn't understand what I did. That is when I remembered something. What did you remember? I remembered that we didn't lock lips. Oh? Did you kiss her then? What else? Tell me I have a small doubt. I've observed this with a lot of people. Even after they've exhausted talking about everything there is to talk about, they still keep asking,"What else?". That's because the actual talk begins then. What else? Tell me. Take my bike and go.. -How are you going to go back then? -Abhi said that he would pick me up. Shailu, listen to the class. -Bye. -Bye. What's up, madam? Do you want to come? Why would you ask her like that? -What did I say? Madam, please come. -Are you coming, madam? -It would be done fast. It's just a matter of five minutes, madam. You don't even have to pay me, madam. We won't get late. Come, madam. [honks] -She wouldn't come. -Go to that woman there. Let's go. What happened? Why do you look so dull? Nothing. Let's go. It's okay. Tell me. I told you that it's nothing. I saw it. They must have messed with you. Instead of grabbing him by his shirt and thrashing him, Why would you run away? Well, I was scared. Why are you scared? They should be the ones who should be scared not knowing what would happen, if they mess with a woman. If you escape and come here, what are they going to think about you? They will follow you again tomorrow. You must be the ones to save yourself. No one will come and save you. Do you understand? I don't like this, Madhu. I am going to leave. -You come in the bus. -Abhi... Don't say anything, Madhu. Come home in the bus. -Did you see, Abhi? -What happened? Nothing. We had a fight. Oh? Where is he? He is at the usual place. Shall I take you there? Alright, let's go. Okay. Shailu, you go ahead. I'll come later. Alright. Abhi! -Come. Inside. -Hmm, okay. Abhi? Abhi? Abhi, where are you? Abhi? Ramu, what is this? -Hold on. -What are you doing? Listen to me. -Okay? -Ramu... -If you cooperate with me for ten minutes, -Please, Ramu don't. -I'll let you go. Okay? -I will leave. -I will leave. -Hey! Hey! Let me go! Ramu! Ramu, please. Please let me go. Stop it. -Listen... -Ramu... No matter how much you shout, no one is going to hear you. -The door is open as well. Okay? -Let me go. Ramu! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go. Listen, Madhu. I will not tell anyone. -No, Ramu. -You don't tell anyone either. Listen to me. Madhu. Ramu, let me go. Listen to me. Listen to me first, Madhu. -Why are you troubling me? -No, Ramu. Is it okay, if I was Abhi? Let me go! -Abhi. -Where will you go? Let me go, please. You won't understand if I tell you nicely. Abhi! [groans in pain] Ah! -You! -Ah! Hey, hey! -Madhu... -Abhi... -What are you doing, brother? -What are you doing? Please listen to me. That's not what it is. -Listen... -Hey! What are you doing in there? You said that she gets you higher than a cigarette. So, I wanted to check her out. How could you think like that? How? How could you think that? Hey! Why are you overreacting? Weren't you courting her just so that you can sleep with her, right? She came when you called her. Wouldn't she come if I call her as well? How will she come to you? Do you even know what you're talking about? Yes, I wanted to sleep with her. But after spending time with her, I found out that there is something beyond sleeping with her. It could be love, liking or something else. I don't know. She is very nice. And I want her to be like that. Don't interfere, Ramu. We assume a lot of things about girls looking at them from a far. You think all they are useful for is this. But there is something else. You and I can't understand it because we are idiots! I am just beginning to try and understand them. Don't disturb me. 'Until then, we thought it was just fun. It suddenly got serious.' 'Only when I got angry with Ramu,' 'I realized that my feelings for Madhu were love.' "The waves in the sea meet." "The dreams have just opened their eyes." "I've never imagined this sort of a relationship." "I got to know that this is love." "I don't know if I exist or not. I wonder what happened to me?" "I searched for myself in you. I turned into you." "For the first time, I am looking at myself all a new." "I changed my path after meeting you" "Love. Love. Lots of love." "Realizing right this moment." "Desire. Desire. Desires have begun." "A madness has begun in the heart." "My little heart has been hiding and peeking at you." "How would it know which way and in which direction to look?" "And with your imprint, a new beginning is here." "I am going to call you that, don't say anything." "You've imprisoned my raging youth." "You are deep in my heart and made it flutter." "You've showed me the sweetness that's hidden in the lips." "Shared your eternal love with me." "Love. Love. Depth of love" "Realizing right this moment." "Desire. Desire. Desires have begun." "A madness has begun in the heart." Where are you off to, dear? To the college? -Madhu... -Yes, dad. -Alright, come with me. -How are you? -I am good, uncle. -You can go in sometime. Sit for sometime. Uncle, I am getting late for the college. -Bye, dad. -Go safely, dear. What happened? I have a bike with me. And I have a girl giving me company. It's a dream-come-true moment for me. [train honks] [birds chirping] Really? What other dreams do you have? A good job. I want to buy a good bike. And I want to stay with you forever. Oh, yes. I forgot. I want to settle down abroad. They are small dreams. I don't have any other dreams. [train honks] [mobile rings] [cicadas chirping] -Hello? Happy birthday. -Hello... Thank you. Tomorrow, after college, you must throw us a party. Alright, alright. I'll speak to you later. -Happy birthday, Madhu. -Thank you. -Happy birthday, Madhu. -Thank you. -Happy birthday, Madhu. -Thank you. What's your program tomorrow? Let's go out tomorrow and have some fun? -I'm getting a call. I'll call you later.-Okay. 'What the hell is he doing?' 'Is he sleeping?' -Look at them once. -Even Suresh came to the party, right? -Hi! -Hi! -Madhu... -Hi! -Hi! -Madhu, happy birthday. -Happy birthday, Madhu. -Thank you... Thank you. -Thanks. -Look at how they are. -There's a story going on in each corner. -What happened? -All of them are stories. -What happened? He always fights with her. Everyone wished me. Why didn't you wish me? Everyone will wish you. If I wish you as well, there's no difference between them and me. -They are different and you are different. -Alright, fine. I'll wish you for your next birthday. You said you would wish me on my next birthday. Next birthday. -Hi, Shailu. -Happy birthday, Madhu. Let's stop all this and get along with each other. Are you going to stick to your word? When in love, these things are pretty common. You wouldn't wish me this year either? You know me, right? It's going to be the same dialogue. What? You wouldn't wish me for this birthday either? -No. -Get lost! -Bye. -Bye. What is your endgame here? She is crying. Why can't you wish her? Of all the people in the world, I am the one who is the happiest because she was born. According to me, in fact, even more than her parents. I cannot stuff such an emotion into mere two words of Happy birthday. Alright. Since you asked me, I'll tell you next year. -Gosh! Let me be. -I'll tell you next year. [college bell rings] The next month, we will be having an on-campus drive. So, I wish you good luck and do well in the exams. Congrats, Mr. Abhimanyu. You are selected. Thank you, sir. So, Mr. Abhimanyu, you've grown your beard so much. Is this your style? No, sir. It's my confidence. You got selected for the Vizag branch. Okay, sir. Thank you. Okay. Bye. What happened? He got a job. Good news! Why would you be so unexcited about it? He is not excited either. Why? His job is in Vizag. Where is Vizag? It's right here. He will be that way now. You should convince him and send him to Vizag. -Go and return safely, son. -You be careful as well. Have your meals on time. [music mutes voices] [music mutes voices] So... One of you will be selected for our Australian branch. It will be completely dependent on your performance. Okay, the meeting is over. You can leave now. Sir, since I am the topper in this batch, send me to Australia. -Now tell me the truth. -Sir, trust me, I am the topper. It's been my dream to go to Australia since I was young, sir. First, your job performance should be great. Sir, you just need to say okay. The performance is going to be okay as well. Trust me. -Yeah, I've seen a lot of such stories. -Sir... Sir, please stop. Sir, going to Australia has been my dream. Tell me. You sound dull. What's going on? It's because you are not here. -Well, shall I come there then? -Where are you going to come? There's no need. If that's the case, you come here. I want to see you immediately. What do you mean come there? You think you are in the neighboring house? So what? Can't you come here for me? Really? I am there. See me? -Where are you? -I am right beside you. You don't even know my address. How are you going to come here? Why would I need and address to come into your dreams? Wouldn't it be enough if you simply closed your eyes? No. Even if it's a dream, I need to have some clarity about how it all is. Really? Fine, tell me how you want me there. -Tell me where you are. -I am in my home. Mmm... Where are you right now? Okay, okay. I just arrived in Vizag. Book a cab and come to Madhuravada. Okay, I am here. Can you see an arch named 'Vasanth Nagar'? Yes, I can see it. Come inside from there. Why? I could have simply asked the cab to drop me there. Outside vehicles are not allowed in our area. Oh really? Walk straight up and you can see a board to your right. -Uh... Okay. -Come inside from there. When you keep coming in, you would see a building on Plot 150. I will be waiting in the penthouse for you. I am there. Can you see me? Come closer. -A little more. -Mmm... I miss you. I miss you so much. -Mwah! -Mwah! "Only when I am far, I get closer to you." "We don't need a language. We are dipped in silence." "I am in a hurry to see you." "I won't get rid of these thoughts until I reach you." "My feet keep running but I wonder why they are so slow." "I wonder in which moment I would be enveloped in your embrace." "When an irreplaceable memory gives me company," "Love is a season and the larks sing merrily." "Love. Love. Depth of love." "Realizing right this moment." "Desire. Desire. Desires have begun." "A madness has begun in the heart." Son, do you have to leave so soon? Won't you let my daughter-in-law stay with me for even a few days? I've exhausted all the leaves that I've taken for the wedding, mother. The festival is around the corner. We will be back then. Alright, fine. Son, take care of my daughter-in-law. Alright, alright. Shall we go? [music mutes voices] [birds chirping] [mobile rings] Hello? -Madhu.-Tell me. I bought a bike. What color is it? Blue. Oh? I should be the first pillion rider. Really? If that's the case, come to Vizag. Madhu, go up and get the clothes, dear. Alright. My mom's coming.Cut the call. Hey! You said you wanted to be the first pillion rider, didn't you? Come and get on it. On my way, there were two people who wanted a lift. A pity I didn't agree. Are you going to put your right leg first? Did you come all the way from Vizag like this? Yes. Stop the bike. -Why? -Stop. Tell me why? Stop the bike. I'll tell you. From now on, don't ever ride a bike without a helmet. Mother! You didn't even call and say that you were coming? This is called surprise in English. How much did you pay for that bike? You shouldn't ask me that. Alright, fine. Where is father? -He went out. Don't you have to go to work, son? I took a leave for two days. Really? Alright, when is dad going to be home? What's going on with you? Ever since you came in, you are acting sketchy. What is it? Do you want to talk to him? Yeah, I have to talk but not with dad. I want to speak to you. If you want to talk to me, why did you keep on asking me about your father? I mean!I wanted to talk to you when dad wasn't around. What's the matter? Come here. Sit down. Mother, I am in love with a girl. I want to get married to her. What are you talking about? Love? What do you mean Love? You've been working only for three months. And you are already in Love! Not now, mother. I fell in love while spending dad's money. Now I am working. Why? Shouldn't I get married? You shouldn't get married. And you know that. Is that why you wanted to talk to me when your dad isn't around? Don't be so sneaky. Mother, why are you making it a big deal? I have already made up my mind. I am going to marry the girl I am in love with... She is going to be your daughter-in-law. She is going to be right in front of you. She is a very good girl. She isn't an idiot like me. Some one like me needs someone like her beside me. If not, I am going to go rouge. I know that. You would know it too. In the future, you are going to remember this situation and regret it. You would be sorry to have scolded me. Who is that girl? Remember, Madhu from the neighbour's house. Oh goodness! You've started all this at our neighbor's house?! Her mother calls me sister. And by the very extension of it, she becomes your sister. -What? -How can you fall in love with her? Mother, stop! Because you live beside each other, you call each other as sister. You didn't know about us and that's why you addressed each other that way. Now you know the truth. Start calling her 'sister-in-law'. I will break your legs, you idiot! Sister-in-law, huh?! Mother, please listen. What do you mean you are in Love? What's with this nonsense? She is a very good girl. Her father isn't a very good guy. And you don't know about that. I will speak to her father. I will convince her father. What will you speak to him?! Do you think this is a minor situation? How long has this been going on? For a long time. You mean days or years? Four years. You've been fooling us for four years, huh? Alright, fine. What if her father doesn't agree to this? Are you going to stop all this? What? Why is he looking at me like that? I will stop all this, father. Alright. Gosh! What kind of a person are you? It would have been better to broach this topic with my father rather than you. Yeah, right. Go and talk to her father. And you think he would give you his daughter! [phone ringing] Can I come in? Yes, come. The gate is also open. [birds chirping] Hi, uncle. Abhi. Come. Come. When did you come? -I came yesterday, uncle. Come and sit. -How are you? -I am fine, uncle. Go inside and get Abhi and me some good coffee. Why do you need coffee? You just had it. I want to give Abhi company. You just need an excuse to drink coffee. -Now that Abhi is here there! -Yeah. I met your father the other day. You were in Vizag, right? Yes, uncle. What happened? No matter how much I dissuaded him, your son went to the neighbor's house... He went there to ask his daughter's hand. Uncle, I like Madhu. If you agree, I will get married to her. What else is happening, dear? You should tell me, uncle. I like Madhu. If you agree, I will get married to her. What else, young man? You should tell me, uncle. What else is happening? You should tell me, uncle. Here, Abhi. Give me your daughter. I will take very good care of her. What else? You should tell me, uncle. Do you want to say something to me? Yes, uncle. There's something I need to tell you. Tell me. Madhu, please go inside. It's okay, uncle. Let her stay. I wanted to talk about her. Alright. Sit down. Tell me? Uncle, I like Madhu. We are in love. If you give your consent to our relationship, we will get married. I don't know if I am doing a good job of broaching this topic... But this is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about. I spoke to my parents. They agreed. If you agree to it as well... I mean, what I'm trying to say is? -If you speak to my family.. -You told me about this. I am going to discuss this and then speak to you. Well, I grew up right in front of your eyes. If we get married, you can be... Go. Well! Will you agree that easily? Once I step out, everything is going to change, huh? Isn't it? You don't go out. You stay here. You said that there was a potential match for my daughter... I meant that Athreyapuram family. -Yeah, them only. -Uncle. Tell them to come and meet with my daughter. -Why would you do that, uncle? -Not tomorrow. The day after tomorrow is auspicious... -Please listen to me, uncle. -Why are you doing this, uncle? -I said no then. But now, I am saying yes. Please listen to me once, uncle. -Just do what I want you to. -Why are you making a fuss? [indistinct chatter] -Please listen to me once, uncle. -Do as I say... Tell them to come. -Please, uncle. -Okay. Stop. So, what if we are your neighbors? Did you take us for granted? How dare you come to my house and ask me for my daughter's hand? I might serve you coffee even if you are not from our caste. But I would never give you my daughter. Get out of here. Get out! Get out! Listen, a potential groom is coming to meet you tomorrow. Forget about him. If not, I will kill you. Do you understand? -I will get married only to him. -Madhu, stop it. -Husband, please. - Hold on! Just because we live on the same street, you think they are our equals? Couldn't you see the wall in between? Won't I be ashamed to face my fellow caste members? Explain it to her. Explain it in a way that she would understand. If not, I am going to kill the both of you. And that would be the end of it. Such nonsense! -Shailu? -Hold on, mother. Her father took away her phone. He didn't let her speak to me properly either. Shailu! I am talking to you. I'm coming, mother. Where is Mr. Ram Chander's house? Sir? Sir, I am talking to you. Sir, it's here. Come this way. Son, where are you going? Where? -Son, Stop! Stop! -Father, Father? Let me go. -First, listen to me. -Father! -First, listen to me. -Father... Let me go. Let me go, father? -Stop. -Let me go, father. I told you to stop, didn't I? Hey, wait! Come? I told you to come, right? -Try and understand what we are saying. -Come? What happened, brother-in-law? Go ahead and talk. Young man, do you like my daughter? Yes. Dear, what's your name? [music mutes voices] [camera captures] [birds chirping] [music mutes voices] Buddy, why did you butt your heads with this stupid man? You should have told us, right? You should have just eloped with her. Aren't we there to help you? You should have just made one call to us. Aren't we there for you? Hello? You said two days. Why didn't you come yet? -Sir, I am in a bit of a trouble. -Trouble? Alright. Take care of it and come. It's not a problem. Sorry, sir. I am going out and will be back in ten minutes. If you are up to any tricks in the meanwhile, you know what will happen, right? If I get angry, I am not going to behave like a human being. Do you understand? [music mutes voices] [music mutes voices] I didn't think that I would meet you ever again, Madhu. Come, let's go. -Abhi. -What is it? Let's go. -What happened? -I didn't come here to elope with you. I came here to tell you that I can never be with you. I am getting her married by force. But somewhere inside, I am scared. If this wedding doesn't happen... we would lose all respect with our fellow caste members. Nothing like that is going to happen, brother-in-law. Everything regarding this wedding has been arranged. I am going to personally take care of everything. What if it happens? What do we do, brother-in-law? Let's kill him. What are you saying, brother-in-law? At the most, we would have to spend 10 years in jail. But we wouldn't lose face with our caste members. What is your problem, brother-in-law? Is it caste or caste members? Caste means caste members, isn't it? Alright, fine. Ask your boys to come to the neighborhood. I never saw my father like that. I was scared. I don't know what's going to happen. What if something happens to you? No, Abhi. Let's stop all this. Let's not continue this. If something happens to you, I cannot take it. I thought about not meeting you. I simply wanted to go along with the wedding. The problem is when I marry you. What if I get married to him? They won't do anything to you. But in the meanwhile, if they catch you! That's why I came here to tell you not to do anything. What are you talking about? Why should we stop just cause they are up to something? People are going to do this. But after a few days, everything is going to settle down. You come with me. Don't say anything anymore. -Come. -No, Abhi. Will you be able to live for even a little while? Why are you scared? I am here for you, aren't I? Did you really love me? I am telling you this. So, listen to me. You cannot live happily without me. I mean I cannot live happily without you. I couldn't even stay apart for two months without seeing you or meeting you. If you are not going to be with me, I cannot even imagine my life, Madhu. I cannot be without you. I cannot. Even I cannot live without you. Let's stay this way even after marriage. What? Let's stay this way even after my marriage. What are you saying? Have you gone crazy? I know that I am wrong. But, this very wrong-doing is going to help us stay together. You asked if I loved you, right? If you are in love, the pinnacle of that is to get married. But I am crazy. That is why I am! Even if I don't get married to him, they are going to kill you. They would kill you even if I come with you. I don't know of another way. "jasmine flower, a tiny little thing... You are a drizzle, my tiny little hope." "My queen, my goddess of abundance. You are the sweetness that my heart desires." "If you leave me and go, I am going to stop breathing" "You said that the thoughts of you would never fade away." "Behind these closed doors, you ask me to keep you company..." "You gave you me your word, you will stick to it..." "Doesn't matter how long it is, you will always be by my side." "You gave you me your word, you will stick to it..." "Doesn't matter how long it is, you will always be by my side." Brother-in-law, perhaps we were unnecessarily worried about him. It doesn't look like he was worth the trouble. Let it go. Looks like he was destined to spend some more time on the earth. Alright, fine. Tell your boys to leave. [vehicles honking] Sorry, we are in Vizag. A man committed suicide because he couldn't be with his beloved. How silly. Looks like there is an increasing number of people who have gone mad in love. What happened? Uh-huh! Alright, I am getting late to the office. Bye. Bye. Why would I need your address to come in your dreams? You just need to close your eyes. Even if it's a dream of you, I need to be clear on how things are. Alright, fine. Tell me how you would like me to appear? Tell me where you are right now? I just got of the bus to Vizag. Book a cab and get down at Madhuravada Road. Where do you wish to go, madam? Madhuravada. Can you see an arch named 'Vasanth Nagar'? Outside vehicles are not allowed into our area. Walk from there. When you come straight, you would see a board on your right. Take a right from there. When you come from there, on your left, in the building on Plot number 150, I will be waiting for you in the penthouse. You came? How did you come? Do you know the address? Oh? I must have told you. Why are you tensed? Did you come running? Shall I get you some water? I am trying to be normal, right? Why are you like that? Why can't you at least try like me? You thought something happened to me, right? What could be worse than this? The girl I love, is with someone else. Is there greater sadness than this? Is there anything more painful than this? Death would be more peaceful than this. I am already half-dead. Please don't kill me entirely. Why did you lie to me? You said that even after we are married, we would be the same as before. Where do you see that happening? Are we like before? Earlier, when you were far away, I still felt closer to you. Now look at us. You are right beside me and... You are beside me but... I feel like you are not my Madhu. I am not the same Abhi as well. Because, the Abhi of yesterday was different. He had Madhu by his side. They were very happy with each other. This isn't me. This isn't my life either. It feels like I am renting out someone's life and living it. I just thought I was renting the apartment. Even my life is on rent. I am not in my own life. Why would you be with me? Go away. You shouldn't come here. Go away. You shouldn't come here. Go. Go. Madhu... I keep saying some nonsense. Are you really going to leave? If you had said this earlier, I would have picked a fight with you and even then, stayed with you. But now, I feel like I don't have that right. When you asked me to leave today, I only felt sad. I am not angry. Maybe I can no longer be angry with you. "No matter what the past is, it is all my crime." "This is what we are left with." "Winning and losing are not deal breakers." "This is what moves like a story." "This love is deep as the oceans," "Is the world smart enough to measure it?" "The girl who is far away from me walks towards me." "She has become comfortable with me. And keeps me breathing." I cannot stay idle at home. I wish to join some course. Alright, your wish. [music mutes voices] LOVE Vizag I cannot talk to you over the phone. You don't call me, I will find time and call you. If there is something urgent, just message me saying 'hi'. Talk to me when you are sure that it's me on the phone. Hmm. If I cut the call suddenly, don't call me back. -Madhu, what happened? -[sobs] It's okay, Madhu. It's okay. Abhi, what's all this? Everything is in a disarray. Couldn't you have arranged them properly? Don't you pay attention? Alright, I shall leave. Next time when you leave, do so without tell me. I am happy that you came. But I don't think I can take it when you leave. "If there is today, let me give you company." "But since there is tomorrow as well, I shall take my leave." "No matter which day it is when you leave." "Stay with me as my thoughts." "Shall I become your breath? Shall I fill you up?" "Stay with me like my last breath." "This love is deep as the oceans," "Is the world smart enough to measure it?" "Knowing my limitations that you are not mine" "This heart has silently become distant." -Aunty, please hurry. It's getting late. -Coming, dear. -Here. -Okay, aunty. Bye. Bye, uncle. Shailu, please take care of him. I don't think he would get better soon. It would take some time. Please keep an eye on him. Alright, aunty. Don't keep eating out. You are going to ruin your health. If I have to stop eating out, I have to cook. But, I don't know how to cook. I will cook for you. If I need to eat only what you cook, I might have to eat only twice a week. [doorbell rings] [doorbell rings] [door creaks opens] Why don't you answer your phone? Your mother told me to give this to you... Stop staring. Sit down. When did you come to Vizag? What's going on here? There's nothing here that warrants your surprised expressions. Who is she? She is my lover. Now, she isn't your lover anymore. What do you mean then and now? She will always be my love. -She is married. -So what? I don't think it's a big deal. That means you guys are happy. We are the ones who are unnecessarily bothered. -We are happy? -Hmm. Is that how we look to you? Have you guys planned this? It's wrong. You are making a mistake. No one makes a mistake because they want to, Shailu. The situations force us into making mistakes. But this world doesn't care about the situation you are in. It won't accept your relationship. We don't care about that. What do you mean you don't care? We are living in the society, aren't we? -We are not in some forest, are we? -Huh! Society? It's better to live in the forest than here. In fact, the population of animals in the forest is decreasing. But here, in the society, their numbers are increasing. They are killing people based on who they fall in love with. Some are crazy about their caste, some about their religion... And others are crazy about money. The unfortunate situation is that, her father is not obsessed with caste. In truth, it's insecurity. He is worried about how the people of his caste would judge him. That's all. They are not clear about their very own lives. They go ahead and ruin other people's lives. Alright, fine. Forget about all that. All those in love don't end up getting married to each other, do they? They break up for some reason. But they don't resort to the path that you guys have chosen. -They start their new lives and are happy. -They are happy? How do you know that? Did you watch them? How is it possible that those who are so deeply in love with the other person, suddenly leave all those feelings behind, when they marry another person and stay happy? Tell me. Is it that easy? No. Shall I tell you? We wait for her to return even though she is married. You never know. We keep hoping that they fight with one another and head for a divorce. We keep waiting for it to happen. We keep wondering if she is happy. And hope that in case things don't pan out for her, we would help her out. Alright. How long are you guys going to be this way? What do you mean how long? This is how life's going to be. Alright. I shall leave. Madhu, come. Come and see me off. Where do you want me to drop you off? What kind of a friend are you? Won't you even invite me to your house? I don't have anything to take care of now. Let's go to your house. Madhu, aren't you and your husband happy? You and Abhi... You still don't get us, Shailu. I mean when you are in love you would want to have sex, right? There's love even without sex. Sorry, I forgot your name. -Shailaja. -Oh, nice. What do you do? I came to Vizag to start work. Oh! Alright. -I'll be joining as a developer very soon. -Oh? You must be a topper. Not really. I just got referred by a friend. That's all. If it's is your friend, they must be Madhu's friend as well. What do you say, Madhu? No, no. -He is my friend. He is closer to me. -Oh. [mobile rings] Excuse me. -Hello?-How is he, dear? He is fine, aunty. Is he still thinking about her? Well, it will take some time, aunty. Alright. I heard that Madhu's husband lives in Vizag as well. Yes, aunty. In Vizag. Couldn't they have found a job anywhere else other than Vizag? Alright, fine. I shall take my leave, dear. What happened? -Nothing, nothing. -Okay, carry on. -Congrats, Shailaja. You are appointed. -Thank you, sir. Would you guys be whiling away your time just... because both you friends sit beside each other? -No, sir. -Okay, you can leave now. [music mutes voices] Abhi, wait. I'll come with you. I am not going home. Where to then? What did you tell her before coming here? I didn't tell her anything. My mother called me. She forced me to talk to my father. You should have spoken to him. If I speak to him, I will start recollecting things of my past. Madhu, do you know something? Everyone in the office talks about me. Why is that? I am that good at my job. My HR manager is very impressed with me. [mobile ringing] I came out with a friend. Fine, I'll be back. OK. Tell me. My HR manager is impressed with me. Very soon, he might promote me. [mobile ringing] The key is right there. Alright. Tell me. That's my dream job right. [mobile ringing] Pick it up. Go ahead. I keep waiting like a dog to meet you since morning... You come here and keep talking on the phone. Alright, fine. You talk on the phone. I shall leave. Madhu, Sorry. I am relieved that you got angry with me. But you apologized and disappointed me. What? Apology? When did I apologize? When did I apologize? Did you hear it? No, I didn't. Bye. Why are you late, Madhu? I went out with Shailu. Alright, fine. Come, let's eat. I am hungry. What is this? This is style. I don't think you can carry it off. Take it off. Upendra, she says I can't carry it off. Tell me, what's up? If you are not going to the beach to meet her, we need to go out. What's the matter? Harish and Sravani broke up. Haven't they broken up yet? They could have broken up once and for all like me, right? -It would have solved the issue. -Did you break up? Don't make this about me? Fine, where do we go? Let's go. Come. Hold on, I'm coming. Hi, Shailu. -Hi. Hi, buddy. How are you? How are you? Just the same. Won't you ever change? Why are you always fighting? Why are you lecturing me? She sits there. Ask her.Ask her and she'll tell you. Alright, let's go. -Hi, Shravs. -Hi, how are you? I am fine. You? Stop this small talk. She is talking to someone else. Find out who that guy is. That's none of your business. This is exactly it! This! This is the problem with her. Why does she keep saying that it's none of my business? It's not my business?It is my business. -I am doing so much for you. -He could be anybody. He could either be my friend or even my family friend. You wouldn't understand that. -Friend? -Stop it, Sharavs. Suresh? That Suresh is your friend? How can he be your friend? -How can he be your friend? -He is a friend of our family's. -Him? How can he be your family friend? -Stop it, buddy. He is one useless bugger. Do you know how he speaks of her behind her back? Buddy, hold on. Apparently, she has a crush on him. You talk about it with her, buddy. -Talk to her about this. -Alright, hold on. Why do you guys enjoy breaking up so much? You are confident that you guys will patch up and that is why you guys break up. Tomorrow, if she gets married, to meet you she will not ask her parents permission... but she would ask her husband's permission. I am telling you this because I know that you would understand. Madhu and I are still together. Even she knows. Please don't misunderstand what's happening. I don't have another option. It was necessary. I thought things would be back to normal like before. No, it's not the case. Everything's changed. Do you know what the situation is right now? I cannot look her in the eye. I can't get angry with her. I can't hug her tight. You might be wondering why we are seeing each other despite it being so difficult. At the very least, I can see her. If I call her, I can hear her voice. That's all. That's all there is to it. People have made assumptions about us. Buddy, breaking up when you are in love... And being together despite one of them being married to another person, In the first case, you are sad that they are not with you. In the second case, you are sad that you cannot be with them. But we simply can't get away. It's because we are in love. Earlier you were saying that she was talking to Suresh and some such fellow. You were saying that he claims she crushes on him and something... Every night, my girlfriend sleeps with someone else. And you, you get angry when he demands answers, right? Self-respect, huh? Self-respect. Tomorrow, when someone you don't like lays his hands on your body, what will happen to your self-respect? You said that that fellow is your family friend. But this one is your family. Forget about this. If you really want to break up, break up. That would be the end of all this unfortunate business. And we don't have to get involved in your mess. But, if you do want to stick together, stop these fights. No, buddy. First, get married. You hit her every day. You keep torturing him every day. Do what you want but stay together. Make sure no one gets in between the both of you. I know how it feels when someone gets in between. I am going through it so I know. Why do you always keep checking out your phone? -Why is her phone switched off? -Try again. -Says switched off. -Are you following me again on Instagram? I hope there are no surprises here. Why are they speaking like that again? -Madhu is coming with Shravani, call her. Alright. What? Madhu is coming? Why didn't you tell me? So what if I had told you? Would you have worn another shirt? What is it? She is the same batch as ours. Why wouldn't she come? Don't you think you are going overboard? Please don't dress this beautifully, Madhu. I feel like I'm missing out on something. Hey! Congrats, bro. -You've finally got what you wanted. -What? Stay happy. Buddy! You've done well. All the best. What happened to all of them, sir? Why are they congratulating me? Didn't you say that your performance would be good if we selected you. That is why you've been selected. You are promoted to the Australian branch. You are going to fly. Thank you, sir. -Thank you so much. -It's okay. Good luck. Congrats, buddy. -Congrats, buddy. -Thank you. Thank you. [mobile ringing] [mobile ringing] [mobile ringing] Hello, Shailu. [mobile ringing] Abhi, I'll speak to you later. Bye. Madhu, I'm telling you. -I told you I'll speak to you later. -Listen to me for a minute. -Try to understand. -Bye. Hi. How long are you going to run away? What do you mean running away? I am going to the canteen. Would you like to come? You have your own life. What are you talking about? I got a promotion. Let's celebrate. Come. She isn't in your life anymore. If you stay away from each other, it would be better. Even she doesn't have it that easy... Being this way with you. Try and understand. Nothing will be as before. 'Hi...' 'Hi...' 'Why did you call me a while ago?' 'Nothing...' 'Can I call you now?' [mobile rings] Hello? Tell me. Nothing. I just called you. Why did you call me? I told you that I would call you, right? He was beside me. If he is always beside you, shouldn't I ever call you? What happened, Abhi? Are you okay? Nothing. Then, why are you talking like that? -I got a job offer abroad. -Good news! Why are you sharing it without enthusiasm? I called you because I was happy and wanted to share this news. What happened? You were not there. Now, I am here. No, you should share things when you are happy. We can't postpone it and hold onto the feeling until our dear ones are close by. -Why don't I do this? -What? Shall I introduce you to him as my friend? Then, you can call me anytime. So, you want me to be your friend so that you can introduce me to your husband? How did you even think something like that? How can I ever be your friend? That's not what I meant, Abhi. Hey! That's not what you meant? I got it. Earlier, you convinced me that you would meet me even after you got married. -Now, you are calling me your friend. -Abhi. You are trying to get rid of me slowly, aren't you? -What are you talking about? -Have you gone mad? Yes. I've gone mad because of you and am ruining my life here. What the hell are you talking about? I made a decision that no girl ever would, just for you. Do you know how uncomfortable it is? I am making you uncomfortable, is it? If that's the case, leave me. I will live my life. I can't handle this anymore. It would have been better if you left me then. I would have been sad for a few days and would have been back to normal by now. You are torturing me every day. -Abhi, what are you saying? -Why? Don't you understand? Abhi, is this what you think of me? Yes, blame me. Keep blaming me. [door bell rings] Fine, I'll talk to you later. If you cut the call now, it's going to get worse. Speak to me. No, Abhi. Please. -He is here. Will talk later. -I told you to speak to me. Madhu... How was the day? [mobile ringing] [mobile continues to ring] Who was that? -It was a spam call. -OK. [switched off notification] Did you eat? I did. Why are you dull? Nothing. [message tone] 'Abhi, why are you doing like this, I can't live without you.' I can live without you, I am OK 'You can't live without me, I know that' 'I can... Please leave me' 'No, I won't' 'I'll block you' 'Would you be happy without me?' 'I will be' 'Okay, can I call you once? Please...' Hello? Tell me. Abhi, let's do as you wish. Be however you want to be. It's fine if you don't want to speak to me. But... But? But, send me a birthday wish for my birthday every year. Please. Then, I would be assured that you are still there somewhere. [mobile ringing] Mother? Tell me, son. Can't I live without Madhu? Are you still with her? What do you want me to do, mother? I want to forget Madhu. Listen to me and get married Alright, mother. I'll get married. My girl studied engineering. She's been brought up well. She is here, working in Vizag. She earns quite well too. Husband, why go into all those details? After they get married, they'll sort these out themselves. Young man, do you wish to speak to my daughter alone? It's alright, sir. -You can go upstairs and talk to her. -It's okay. It's not a problem for us. Nowadays, these are quite common. Go, son. Go and talk to her. I'm asking you to. They want you to speak to her. Go ahead. It's no problem, young man. Go on ahead. Do you like me? What do you say now? I want to completely forget Madhu. Tell me your email password once. Tell me. Madhulovesabhi@225 First, change that. That will help you. Do you like me? We might forget those we fell in love with. But it's difficult to forget the memories we had with them. If possible, leave those memories behind. It might be difficult. But it's necessary. Try it. [vehicles honking] Buddy, how many photos might you have taken together? Delete them. When I say delete, don't just delete them. Use Shift + delete. Don't try to go into the recycle bin and search for them. You tried everything but you forgot something. What is it? I sent you a number. Call that number. Hello? Hello? Idiot! What is it? Speak. -Who are you? -Chari gave me your number. Oh? Do you want me to come to your room? -No. -Video call? -No. -Pics? Do you want me to speak to you over the phone? Yeah, on the phone. Come on, send 2000 through PayTM. Hurry up. What an idiot! Let's go. Hi, baby. [voice muted] Meditate, buddy. Everything will settle down. Listen to me. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. Let go of your breath. Try to remember those you like. When we think about those we like, our heart is peaceful. A small smile creeps up your lips. The entire body is pleased. Son, we waited this long for you to like someone. We figured out that it's not possible. We've zeroed in on a potential match. The girl is really good. She is a good-looking girl. And they are close to us as well. I somehow don't like the idea of it, mother. If not for you, at least try and get married for us. Alright, mother. Do you like me? Don't tell me that you like me. Actually, I am in love with someone else. Even though my father knows about it, he still tried to fix me up with you. Please, do something and break off this alliance. Young man, do you like the girl? It's okay. You can go home, think it over and tell us. I need to speak something to you, uncle. Could you please come this way? What is it, young man? Is it regarding dowry? I will make sure there is no dearth of anything. No, uncle. I heard that you are a strict about your caste and our caste practices? Your daughter told me. Of course! I have deep respect for our traditions. How can we let go of our caste? And members of our caste. They are the best. Yes, uncle. That's the thing. I called you here to talk about it. I am not the kind to be prejudiced towards a certain caste or religion. After I get married to your daughter, I am going to tell her the same thing. I'll ask her to leave all these behind. She is educated, she would understand. When we have children, I am going to raise them without these kinds of thoughts. I don't think our families are right for each other. Really? Fine. -Uncle, one more thing. -What is it? Nowadays, everyone's changing. You change as well. If not, everyone's would have already changed... and you would be alone like an untouchable. That would never happen. Aren't people converting into different religions? Caste is no longer tied to a particular profession, isn't it? When you keep moving about when here and there, you would become clear on certain things and you would be vexed with all this. That is when you would become a human being. It will happen, uncle. It will. -Hello?-Tell me, buddy. How are you? If you have any pics of Madhu, send them to me. I don't think I have them. Why don't you ask Shailu? Why would I bother her now? If you have them, send them to me. Alright, alright. If I have anything, I'll send it. [message tone] What is this? All the formalities have been taken care of, you have to leave in another 10 days. And now you tell me that you don't want to go. No, sir. I am not interested. Please give this opportunity to someone else. Isn't this your dream job? It was, sir. Until yesterday. What's your dream for today? Nothing, sir. Alright, fine. If we send you when you are not interested, you end up taking that frustration out on us. I will find someone else. You go. Thank you, sir. Won't you ever change? Are you going to ruin your career because of her? What an idiot! Bro, chill. It doesn't matter. If you don't go, I will. If I go, it's the same as you going there. -Don't worry. Okay. -Moron! Smiling like you've accomplished something? You and your idiotic decisions! I wonder where such idiots come from! You won't ever change. You are going to be this way forever. Let's go. Why are you silent? You surely have something to say, don't you? Say it. Why are you doing this? How can I leave you? (singing) I will never break this friendship. Do you even know what you are doing? When you got your passport, you felt like you achieved something. What happened now? Tell me. When Madhu is here, where can I go and what can I achieve? You guys are not speaking to each other anyways. There are a lot of things between us. Given the situation we are in, there are even more things happening between us. Even so, how can I go far away from her? Whether it's tomorrow or the day after, I will meet her. I figured that I cannot live without her. She kept telling me that. But I didn't listen to her. I tried really hard to get away from her. No matter what I did, it turned out to be useless. I pondered over this and finally came to a conclusion. I've decided to be with her. In truth, I've begun to forget about her. I keep forgetting about her when I am at work or... when I'm speaking to friends or when I'm doing something else. But, when I forget her and am busy doing something, I think of her suddenly. And at once, I feel some sort of pain here. I don't know what's going on with me. Perhaps, she coming to my mind suddenly is not a good thing. That is why I am going to remember her. We need to remember only if we forget, what if I don't forget What if I constantly have her in my thoughts? She will never come into my thoughts suddenly. I will remember her always, she will be with me and in me. [woman sobbing] [thunders rumbling] [rain pattering] [woman retching] [mobile ringing] Where are you? I am in the room. I am at the institute. I am coming. Alright. Today is my birthday. Do you remember? Yes, I do. You said that you would wish me. Why didn't you? It's been so long since I got on your bike. Get on. I wonder how I've been all this while. I've been wanting to be with you, sit with you. We are not meeting each other but I am always with you, Madhu. I am jealous of you. Why am I so crazy about you? All this while, I have been speaking. Why aren't you saying anything? I am pregnant. From now on, I can't meet. We can't talk. Let's break up. Do you think we are together now? We have already broken up. That's the mistake we made. We've been together even after we've broken up. What happened now, Madhu? Is you being pregnant the problem? I tolerated you sleeping with someone else. Do you think I haven't expected this? This isn't what I'm talking about. I am worried about you. What could happen to me, Madhu? I am fine. Why aren't you going abroad? I didn't like it. I am not going. So what? You've always wanted to go abroad. And now you don't? You are doing this for me, aren't you? You are letting go of your life and your dreams for me. I don't like this. I feel like this is all wrong. That day we've decided to be together. That's true. But I didn't make that decision to see you like this. I thought we would be like we were before. But no. Every day, you are being crushed. You fought me the other day. You said that you wouldn't talk to me again. What happened? You fight only with me. You are sad because of me. And you say that you are fine because of me. This might look like love for you. But I am scared. I'm beginning to realize this now. All this while, our love grew. But, our sorrows grew in the same measure. I am scared how much further this will go. As soon as you called me, I came running to you like a little kid. Why are you talking like this? You cannot live without me. I know that. You are just saying that. I can live without you. But, I can't see you like this. Please go away. Please. This was my mistake. Telling you that we are going to be as we were with each other, is my fault. Keep blaming me all your life for this. I don't mind. Please leave. Let's stop. No more. Please Please. All that I'm receiving for your end is Love. My only contribution is helplessness. I am not able to compete with you in how much we love one another. I couldn't bear breaking up with you once. Why are you breaking up with me so many times? This is our last break up. Madhu! Wait. Drop me here. I'll leave. Madhu! Do you seriously want me to go? Please don't keep asking me over and over again... I am scared that I would end up asking you to stay. Hey, Madhu. Do you remember me? I am Ramu. How are you? Buddy, park the bike aside. I heard that you got married to someone else. Hi, buddy. He seems to have it all. Did you forget all about us? How are you? You must be fine. You've been hooking up with her even after she got married to someone else? I knew it right then. That she was this kind of girl. I have a doubt, buddy. Tomorrow, when she has a baby, whose baby would that be? -Is it yours? -Abhi! Abhi! You go, Madhu. No, buddy. No. Abhi, you go. -Madhu, you go. I will take care of it. -Go get him. Go on. It's alright. Abhi! Please, Abhi. Ramu, I am in a very bad place right now. Let's not get into a fight. -Madhu, go away. -Alright, you go too. You are the only one frustrated? Yes! Ramu! Ramu, please, huh? Ramu, please, huh? No, don't. Madhu! Madhu, get up. -Madhu... open your eyes. -Get me that stick... the stick. Madhu, get up. Open your eyes, Madhu. Get up. Buddy, let's go. We don't need this. Madhu, get up. Madhu! -Shailu.-Tell me. Madhu got hurt. -I am taking her to the hospital. -What? -Alright, alright. Send me the location. -Please hurry up. Slowly, slowly. Careful. -What happened? -She got hurt. -Isn't the doctor here? -Fill this form up. What is it? What is it for? It's to admit her. It's to admit her. You are her husband, right? -She is your wife, isn't she? -How are you related? How are you related to the patient? How are you related to the patient? How did this happen? She slipped on the stairs at the institute. Who is he? He is my friend. He helped me bring her here. Thanks, brother. She is alright. There is nothing to worry. She is a bit shocked. Take good care of her. Okay? You can come only until here. And he can go all the way there. You've handled Ramu. But tomorrow, there will be others pointing fingers. How many are you going to thrash? I will go abroad. Will you speak to HR? Will you stick to your word? Okay, I'll talk to HR. "Shall I forget about you..." "and write our story which is not mine " "Shall I leave it behind completely? " "Shall I make a turn and keep going? " "Shall I leave you for yourself, who am I to you? " "When someone asks me who he she. " "I shall say that I am a memory that never leaves me. " "Shall I leave you for yourself, who am I to you? " "When someone asks me who is she " "I shall say that I am a memory that never leaves me. " "Shall I Forget this journey of ours. " "and the path to an unknown destination. " "shall I stop this journey with you " "The only thing that's left in the end is nothingness. " "Every dream that I've had feels like a stranger and slips away. " "The truths have become distant from me and gone somewhere. " "Every one hanging on my lips is arrested. " "I am confused and in chaos all the time. " "In this dark heart all the memories are piled onto the fire. " "And the silence that is left is shared equally between us. " "Time just like our change of heart keeps moving forward. " "Is it possible for us to be just statues for the rest of our lives? " "Shall I Forget this journey of ours. " "and the path to an unknown destination. " "shall I stop this journey with you " "The only thing that's left in the end is nothingness. " Are you going to leave without telling me? You coming to see me off is all well and good. But I can't see you leaving. I can't take the two minutes where I bid you goodbye. [airplane whizzing] What? He hasn't reported to you yet? Hold on, I'll find out what's going on. What's going on? Where is your friend? It's been four days since he left and he still hasn't reported to the office there. How do you want us to interpret this? If he is not interested, he must say so. He shouldn't hamper our work like this. Call him immediately and find out where he is. How long are you going to be like this? What do you mean? This is how my life is going to be. Isn't this your dream job? It was. Until yesterday. You guys aren't speaking now. We have a lot of issues to deal with between us. Tomorrow or the day after, I will meet with her again. Hi, Shailu. I knew that you would be coming. I will get straight to the point. You've guessed right. I am not going abroad. I am leaving. I am going to die. Don't panic, Shailu. I never imagined that I would come to such a decision. But, I don't have any other option. I want to get over everything, But this life isn't letting me do that. Every time, I am losing, Shailu. They say that she is someone else's wife. They say she isn't mine. How can she not be mine? She is mine. No matter when, she is always mine. She is mine. Who the hell is he in between us? Never mind. No point blaming him. He is the one who is going to take care of her from now on. He should be well. He should be well. I didn't want to tell you this. I wanted to leave quietly. But... this... this girl who is crazy about birthdays... Madhu! She wants me to send her a message on her birthdays. Who is going to message her when I leave? So, send her a message from me on her every birthday. That's all. Do me this one favor. Consider this your last favor for me. This is the last anyway. -No! -Don't you forget. Abhi, you can't do this. [airplane whizzing] "Every moment you are with me, touches me like a wave. " "Today, you've become an ocean and drowned me. " "The entire world has become dark and it envelops me. " "Discouragement flows like a current and it keeps dragging me with it. " "This air is becoming steam in this heavy breaths. " "When I keep swimming towards those far away destinations, " "They melt away into the floods. " "Living without you is not at all possible for me. " "You please find a beautiful ending for our story " [voices muted] Please don't tell her that he is not alive, aunty. If she gets to know about it, she will... Madam, courier for you. I will tell you on your next birthday. Perhaps, Abhi is dead to the entire world. But in Madhu's world, Abhi is alive forever. Every year, he would be wishing her just like this.
