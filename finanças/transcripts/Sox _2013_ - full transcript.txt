Hey. You're not helping me very much, Jess. Can't you see them? They're everywhere. Mom, I'm trying to keep aliens away from the garden. How could you be gardening when aliens are attacking? Well, thank you. You know, now that I think of it you have been a very help... because I, I barely see any aliens at all now. I got 'em all, Mom. Come here. Thank you. Mom! What? I can't hug you anymore? Is that what this is? Not when I'm laser beaming, Mom. I can't let my guard down. Oh, yeah. We wouldn't want that, laser man. I liked our old house. Why did we have to move? Well, we're a family now. Me, you, Liam and Thomas. And our old house wasn't big enough for all the new memories we're gonna make here. Well, you think they're gonna like it? They're gonna love it. I like Thomas, Mom. Mm-hm. He's nice. I think I see an alien over there! Yup, by the table! Get it! Got it? Good, thank you. That one over there. Thank you. You all right, buddy? Hey, sport, I know this seems like we're going really fast... but this is our life now, you know? And, and look at the good stuff. You're gonna be closer to Uncle Nick... and your school and kids. So we want you to, you know, take it easy on those guys, okay? You know, Liam, the First Rule of Family Knots is all about communication, so... Dad, I know what The Family Knots... Right. I heard it a hundred times. You promised. I just want you to take it easy on them, okay? Sure. All right, sport. Do me a favor, okay? Try to be nice. I think they're here! Hi, 'ya, Thomas. Jesse, how are you, man? I'm good, how are you? Good! It's so nice to see you. Hello, hello. Hi. How are you, Mrs. Levy? Wow. I'm fine. Mm. Mmm. It has been extremely lonely living in this big, brand spanking new house... all alone longing for Mr. Levy to join me. Mm. I'm glad. And, anxiously waiting for another sweet little boy to join us. Hi, Liam. Hello, Christina. Welcome home. So, why don't we go inside. See the work that Christina's done. Why don't you lead the way, laser man. Come on. Come on. Come on in, guys. Wow. Wow. Hmm? This is... This is it. Now I haven't finished unpacking everything yet... but our bedrooms and the living room, and our bathrooms are just about done. This is great. You should see our room. Our room? Dad, did he just say, "Our room?" You didn't tell them that they were sharing a room? I didn't really get around to it, I guess. We really need to have a talk. One second. Honey, there's actually something I need to tell you. Tell me what? Two things, really. And this may be number one. Pleased to meet you. Paula Preston. I am the Precinct President of the Plantation Pines Neighborhood Association... and we are pleased as punch to welcome you to this neighborhood. Oh, a pecan pie. Oh, my god, thank you. I personally prepared it myself. Thank you, Mrs. Preston? Uh, Ms. Preston, actually. It's a First Prize Winner at the Pacy's Picnic for Presentation. Wow, thank you very much. Uh, this is my wife, Christina. Hi. Hi. And our boys, Jesse and Liam. Oh, well, pleased to meet you. It's my pleasure, I'm sure. This pie looks delicious. Perhaps we could share recipes some day? Perhaps. You know, something just popped into the old pumpkin. Oh, did it really? Her pumpkin... Uh, plum pudding. I can pass by, preferably Thursday, prior to 12 p.m... and then we can trade recipes over plum pudding? Sounds like a... date. Thought you were gonna say plan. It was, uh, very nice to meet you, and thank you so much for the pie. Boys... say goodbye. Peace. Ooh... peace. Oh, it was such a pleasure. Enjoy the pecan pie. Very nice to meet you, Ms. Preston, thank you. Pleasantly wonderful. Thank you. Mm... Was that your surprise? Not exactly. Are you expecting someone else? Uh... Hey. Uncle Nick. Whoa! Don't come any further. Nick? Hey, sis. Is this what you wanted to talk to me about? Not exactly. Look what Uncle Nicky got you guys as a housewarming gift. A dog, that is so cool! Look at his legs! He looks funny. You look funny. Do not. Do so. Not. So, so, so, so. Not, not, not. Boys, this is enough! A word, Mr. Levy. He's cute, huh? Yeah. Come here. I suppose you're wondering why we're here. I'm Donald. Yes, we've met. I'm Donna. Yes, I know. When was the last time you saw this dog. What happened to your arm? Oh, he got attacked by a dog. I wasn't attacked. Oh, you got mauled. I had it under control. It was real bad. You know I was in control... Uh, look, your dog... We need to find your dog. And who are you again? That's Jim... yeah. As I've told you, I am Dale. Oh, Jim... yes. Jim makes an amazing curry salad. So good. Yummy. Yeah, yummy. Salad is good... Yeah. For the soul. I am Dale Hooger... of the FBDI... Federal Bureau of Dog Investigations. And this is my colleague, Zowie. Howie. Howie. With an H. He's a local dog catcher. Not Zowie. Uh, Donald, I've known you for over ten years. We were in... We were in 4H together. Oh, yes, my dog. Oh, no, I've never had a dog. No dog. This picture was taken by a security camera at the scene of a large fire... at a chemical testing facility. In said picture, with said dog... is a collar that had your information on it. Now, we need to find this dog. It is a matter of national security. Come on, they love him. I thought it would help them bond, you know? I thought... it's a good idea. Bond? Here it goes. What? The fighting. Mom and Dad used to do it all the time. I wish someone would stop them from fighting. It's just a little dog, Christina. Oh. But if you don't want them to have him, I mean, I will totally tell them. I mean, we are a team. I will support you 100 percent. Mm-mm, you are not gonna make me to be the bad guy here. Well, then, what do you want me to do? All right, all right. Fine. Look, we'll see how it goes, all right? This is just temporary. Promise. Look, he's coming over here. Ah, I don't think the dog should be in the house, okay? It doesn't look like a house dog to me. Look at him. He's, he's basically trained. I mean, that is where I found him. Found him? Where did you find him, Nick? In the house, in my house. It's actually kind of funny. I, uh, after we hung up the phone, and you said you wanted a... Well, he was right there in my living room. How'd he get in your house? Why is he looking at me? He likes you. Probably thinks you're cute. Oh, well, I... I've never owned a dog. No. Wait, I remember that collar. I gave that collar to a friend of mine. Oh, yeah! That was a long time ago. I remember the collar, too. What this friend of yours a dog? Yes! Oh, but he would never hurt anyone. Oh, no, he was a righteous dude. Very righteous. And when was the last time you saw this "dog friend?" Hmm, what is the date? 5:00. 17th. Oh, and the date. Oh, it's Friday, Mr. Sanky. Friday, the 17th. 17th. Uh, so, uh, uh, uh... when was it that you saw your dog last, again? The 14th. The 14th. Could be important. Better jot that down, Wowie. No... May. May. Yes, May. What do you mean, May? What does he mean by May? I don't know. Maybe... May 14th, 2008. That was a good year, I remember it like it was yesterday. That was a good year. That was a really good year. Lego Land. I remember that. Um, is there anything else that you guys want to tell us? Like, for example, uh, the dog's name? Or anything, distinguishing markings. Anything that would help us find him. He has dog hair. That's important. It's... yeah... Do you have any idea where he might have gone five years ago? Has anyone else contacted you from said collar? No. Wait, no to not knowing where he went? From where he contacted you? Or no to no one contacting you? Or was it from the last caller... Yes. Okay, well, thank you, Miss Sanky. Um, Miss Sanky? Okay! Well, thank you so much, gentlemen. Thank you. Oh, wait, there's one more thing. What? Well, he detests dog food, just hates it. Well, he knows that he hates dog food, but he can't tell us the dog's name? Oh, he likes the coffee black. No sugar, because sugar is bad for you. And yes, very bad for dogs and humans. And he's special, he's very special. Yes, we know how special the dog is. Oh. Oh, and he's wearing socks. Could be important, write that down, Wowie. Well, ladies, thank you very much. You know? And next time, I promise I will make you some tea. Can't wait. See you at the meeting. Better go to the bathroom. That got my stomach all riled up. She's a few cards short of a full deck, if you know what I'm saying. Mm, she's the closest contact we have... to the nation's most wanted animal criminal. You better hope we find that dog or you're gonna be looking for a job, soon, friend. Well, how do I find him? Oh, I've been searching for that canine for over seven years. I know how he works. He will not outsmart me. Go get him, Sherlock. It's not funny. It's not. All right, it was kind of funny. And you have to admit, you looked a bit like a fire hydrant... so you can't really blame the guy. Stop, you know what? I'm serious. You really should have talked to me first. That's all I'm saying. I just wanted it to be a surprise for you and the boys. I mean, if, if I thought it was gonna be a problem... I wouldn't have had Nick get him in the first place. You've got to believe me. Of course, I believe you. So, what? Is this what you wanted to talk to me about? Not exactly. Look, whatever it is, I'm with you a hundred percent, okay? As long as we can finally start our lives together. I've missed you. Yeah. What is this? That is actually what I wanted to talk to you about. Thomas? I'm going away to San Francisco. Just for a week. Oh, come on! I'll be three hours away! A week? You gotta understand The Family Knots Counseling Center is opening. What's it gonna look like, if the Founder and Creator... of the fastest growing family counseling plan is, is not there? The investors will... I mean, the investors are gonna go nuts. This is the biggest thing to happen to this company since it started. I can't miss this opportunity. You said it might not happen, though. I... I said it might not. But I also said it might. And I might get to speak in front of 2,000 clinical psychology students at Berkeley. I can't miss out on this. Thomas, we've been married for a week and I've hardly seen you. I know. I'll make it up to you. Promise. I promise. Mm. Can't you let Nick handle some of the opening, that way you won't be gone for so long? Would you let Nick handle the opening? No. Exactly. We will pick up every stray dog. We will talk to every dog owner who is in this city until we find that criminal canine. No one will get past us. We will talk to everyone who's ever stepped in dog poop... everyone who's ever been bitten by a flea. That's how we will find him. That's why I am numero uno at the FBDI. I see everything you cannot. The only thing special around here... is you. For once, Howard, I agree with you. So what do you think... To San Francisco? Yeah, it'll be fun. Why? There's nothing fun about driving to San Francisco. Uh, I don't want the dog on the couch. Sweetheart, relax, it's not a big deal. So what did you decide, guys? We need you to be the tiebreaker. You mean you want us to be the tiebreaker? Whatever, I want to name him the awesome name of turbo. I told you, he doesn't like that name. I say we name him Turtle. That name is horrible. It's not horrible. It is. No, it's not. Yes, it is. Not, not. Is, is. Boys, boys, that's enough, okay? Guys, you're not thinking his name through. I mean, look at him. His name should be obvious. Yeah, I mean, it's gotta be something special. I mean, it's gotta have a meaning, something behind it. Exactly! I mean, look at him, he doesn't look like a Spot or a Snowball or a... He can't have a regular dog's name. No, it's gotta be something that has meaning. And purpose. His name should be... The dog's name should be... Come on, guys! Sox. What's it gonna be? Sox. Sox. They look like boots to me, but I kind of like Socks. No, but Sox with an X. Perfect. I like that. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think, Sox? - I think he likes it. - That's a good idea, Liam. I thought you said it first. No, it wasn't me. But you know, sometimes it's just the best ideas... Right out of thin air. Hey, I like it. Mom, what do you think? Why not? Welcome home, Sox. I found the dog I was looking for. Heh, heh. Mm. Look, man, how long do we have to keep doing this? Okay? We already put up bulletins and searching the pound. We search for the dog as long as it takes to find the dog. That's how long we search for the dog. I mean, any one of these dogs could be him. Look, why don't we just ask people, like I said earlier? What on earth are you doing? If you want to find a dog, you've got to think like a dog. I'm smelling the air. We don't need to talk to these humans. I'll know the dog when I see the dog. I will smell the dog when I smell the dog. Oh, really? Yes, really. This dog is a criminal master mind. We've had some run ins before but he's always managed to evade me. Sometimes when I smell other dogs, I can smell the scent of that dog on those dogs. He will be mine. There. There! There! That dog! That dog knows something! Oh, oh, what? The poodle? No, no, over. Oh, the greyhound? No, no, whoa, higher. Ah, the Great Dane. No, with the blonde hair. Oh, the dachshund? No, no, no, with the ears. Oh, the golden retriever. No. The chocolate lab? No. Oh, wait, the miniature pinscher? What is that? Chihuahua mix? Thank you. Next to the girl with te... Oh, the sea foam, green jumpsuit. Well, no, it's more like aquamarine. The emerald blue jumpsuit? No, no, no, that's teal. You think that's teal? That looks more like sea foam blue or green. No, it's a bl... Indigo? Dale! Dale! Oh, man! Come on! - Excuse me, ma'am? - Stop, stop, stop, stop. Excuse me, ma'am. I just... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back off, buddy. Easy, easy. I just need to check the dog. This is official business. Whoa, whoa. Back up! Oh! Ooh, ooh! Brutus, kill! Don't kill! Don't kill! Don't kill! Do not kill! Back! Back! Whoo! Whoo! Okay, we're in public. We're in public. Hey. Haven't unpacked yet? Is there another bedroom? You and Jesse got to share a room for right now. All right? Maybe in a couple of months you get your own room. But only if you're nice to both him and Christina. Why do I have to share a room with him? I just thought it would be nice for you guys to do a little bonding. It's not gonna hurt that much. We? Does that mean Christina? Yes, that does mean Christina. You got to understand, I know this is hard for you. But I need you to help me with this. I need you to be respectful. Okay? You know the sooner you unpack, the sooner you can play with Sox. Thanks for the dog. You're welcome, Liam. And there's, uh, there's something else I gotta tell you. Go get it! Go fetch it and bring it back! Come on, boy. Get the Frisbee. Sox, come on. Already? Look, I have to go to San Francisco. Then why do we need to unpack? Because you're not coming with. I need you to stay here. Look, while I'm gone, you're the man of the house, okay? I need you to take care of everything here, and that includes Sox. Please? Please? Okay, now fetch it and bring it back. Come on, boy. Get the Frisbee. Come on, boy! Mom! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey. No Moms. No Moms. We don't need any Moms brought into this equation, okay? Just you and me. Did you just... Hit you in the head with a Frisbee? Yes, I did. Sorry about that. I was gunning for the chest. Let me break it down here for you. That whole, uh, fetch thing? Yeah, I'm not into that. How did you... Right. Oh, that's right. The first time with a talking dog thing. Your mind must be blown. Are you an alien dog or something? Alien dog? Heh, heh, heh, heh. Do I look like Alf? Oh, right. Alf. That's way before your time. You're so cool. I got to tell my Mom. She would never believe me. No, let's not do that. I can't tell my mom? Here's the deal, kid. I've been around for a while. And most adults, they don't take to the whole talking dog thing very well. They faint, pass out... it's a mess. You know that shirtless buff guy from Twilight? Kinda looks like an Ewok? Well that guy nearly wet himself when I told him I was a fan. Kids on the other hand? They tend to accept it pretty fast. That's why I dig you guys. You want me to keep this a secret? Exactly, just you and me. Capiche? Huh? Yes, I would like you to keep it a secret. Okay, you have my word. It'll be our secret. Aces. Ew, I hate roast. I wish we could have pizza tonight instead of yucky roast. No worries. I got your back. All right, well, Nick's coming in a little bit. We're gonna leave tonight. All right. I love you, you know. It's a good talk... and you can talk to Christina if you ever need to. Not gonna happen. All right, well, hey, no pressure, I'm just putting it out there. Okay? All right, buddy. I'll see you in a second. So, I'll call you when I get to San Francisco. Should only be a couple hours. I miss you already. I'm sorry, sweetie. Where are the boys? Uh... Gosh, if only one of them was around, I, you know... want to make sure that you are protected while I'm gone. I can do it, Thomas. Jesse, where'd you come from, buddy? I was over there. I was invisible. Ooh, invisible, huh? You just might be the perfect candidate to take care of your mom, then. I'll do my best. All right, I know you will. Hey, Liam, you gonna say goodbye to your old man before I go? Bye. Wow, that's it, huh? Why can't I just go with you? School hasn't started yet. Come on, you need to stay here. All right? You gotta sleep in an actual bed. You gotta get a home-cooked meal. Mom's a great cook. You're a baby. You're emotionally unstable. Jesse! Guys, just remember the Family Knots while I'm gone, okay? Okay, never mind. I'll be back in a couple of days. Okay. All right, well, just call me later, okay? Yeah. All right. You two go get washed up for dinner, all right? Mom, I don't want roast for dinner. How did you know I was making... Sox! No! Sox! Sox! No! Sox! Go! Go! Go, Sox! Keep going! Run, Sox! Go! Run, Sox, go! Run, Sox! Go Sox, go! Watch out! Watch out! Go! Go, Sox! Go! Go! No, Sox! Go! Go! Go! Keep going! Come on, Sox! No, Sox! No! Go, Sox! Go! Go, Sox! Come on, Sox! Keep going! Well, the roast is ruined. Pizza? Gosh, is that the time? I should really get going. I mean, Nick is probably so... Would not wanna be you, Sox. Love you. Honey, leave. Got it. It's the dog house for you, mister. Out! Hey, kid. Why don't you share the wealth a little bit? I like pizza. Oh, yeah. Yeah, right. Um, my bad. Bad timing. Did you just talk? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But my, uh, mouth doesn't really work like yours. It's more like a telepathy type of thing. I'm going crazy, aren't I? No, you're not crazy. But, yes, I am talking. And by the way, you're welcome for the whole peeing thing earlier. Word to the wise... If you ever want two people to stop fighting, just go over and pee on them. Works every time. Nice. Five second rule. Are you sure you should be eating that? Dibs. Of course the tummy goes crazy a little later, but, eh, I'm a dog. I can go anywhere, if you know what I mean. Ha ha. Liam! Liam! What kind of dog are you? Exnay on the alking-hay. We'll talk about this later. Oh, what are you guys talking about? Talking? We... we weren't talking. Oh, okay. Well, how long are you gonna stay out here? 'Til Dad comes back. I can't let you do that, Liam. Fine. Liam, please understand, dogs need to learn discipline. You know, it would really mean a lot to all of us if you could just, you know, hang loose. You know? Come back in the house. Hang loose? I can't let you sleep out here, okay? Sox did a bad thing and when he learns his lesson... maybe he can come back in the house. Maybe? I'm not gonna argue with you about this right now, okay? Come on. Sorry you got kicked out on the first day, buddy. If my Dad was here, you'd be nice and warm. Talk to you later. Oh, he took the pizza. Hey, you made it to San Francisco already? No, no, no, we're, we're, we're just getting into the city. Uh, I, I got a call from the, the Director of Mental Health Division at Berkeley. Yeah. everything's lining up. It should be great. That's good. Is everything okay? I, yeah, I just, um, I... Sox has already turned me into the bad guy and, um... and Liam, he just... well, Liam just wants nothing to do with me. You know, he just, I just want him so desperately to accept me, you know? I just want him to know how much I love him and that, that's all I care about. It's, hey, slow down. Slow down. He will. All right? I, I, I know he will. It just, it takes a little time to settle in and, and yeah... I really think Sox will make it a lot easier for everybody to get along, you know? So, I'll see you soon? Okay, I love you. Is everything all right? Yeah, everything's... Do you have any antacids in here?? Oh, no. I'm sorry. Oh, God. Seriously, I told you. Two bowls of chili? Two bowls of chili. It was delicious. I don't care. It's greasy-spoon chili, you can't do that to me, man. All right, let's go, I think I know where we're going. Really? This time? What are you doing? I want to show you something. Follow me. This way. It's in our room. I want to show you. Correction, your room. I'm sleeping in the guest room. Soon to be my own room, once I talk to my dad, again. Mom and Dad said we were sharing. My dad. Not yours. Thomas said I could call him Dad if I wanted. He didn't mean it. He's just being nice. It's like when someone you care about leaves... and they say they wish they could stay, but they don't really. But that's sad. Did that happen to you? No. Forget about it, okay? Just call my dad Thomas. Even Tommy, if you like. Just not Dad. Are you sure? Positive. So, you're coming? If I come, will you leave me alone? You're gonna love it. Close your eyes. Not gonna happen. It's great, right? I figured we could sleep in the fort tonight. It's cool... if I was a baby like you. I'm not a baby, and I know you think it's cool. What? I need a sidekick. Every superhero needs one. First of all, I'm no psychic. And second of all, you're no superhero. You're mean. Thank you. I don't think I want you in my fort, anyway. On second thought, I like this room better. You go sleep in the guest room. What if I don't want to? Then I guess the fort comes tumbling down. Just like war. I destroyed your fort, now the room is mine. Just like Sox. That's not fair! Sox is mine, to, you know. Nope. He's only mine. That's not fair! Too bad. I know Sox better than you do. Trust me, no, you don't. Do so. Do not. Do so. Do not. Do so. Prove it. Never mind. Sheets, man, I hate sheets. It's like a never-ending black hole of softness falling on top of you. Sox, how'd you get in here? Christine will kill me if she finds you in here. Yeah, she's a little uptight, huh? Tell your Dad to ship her to the spa for a day. Girls love that stuff. Quiet, boy. You don't want to get in trouble. Don't look at me like that. I'm right on this one, okay? I'm telling you, you don't want to turn out as an EMO, kid. You only get one color. Just walking around wearing black. He is annoying. Me and him aren't gonna work out as brothers. Ugh. You know? I knew this guy a long time ago. Long hair. Carpenter. - Nicest guy I ever met. - One of the smartest, too. He had these 12 dudes that followed him everywhere. Called themselves Disciples. Well, these guys screwed up all over the place, and my buddy had to fix their mistakes. My point is that he didn't care how many mistakes they made, or how annoying they could be. He loved them and always forgave them. And you know what? He considered them his brothers. Good for that guy. Oop, I'm out of here. Sox, Sox, come on, Sox. No, no, good night. - Great talk. Thanks a lot. - See you. Fine, I don't need you, either. Hey, Liam, wake up, wake up. Liam, wake up. Wake up! Come on, come on, get out of bed. Come on. Let go, let go. Hey, come on, man. Oh, you want a piece of me, too? Huh? You think you can take this? Come on, bring it. Both of you think you can take Sox here, huh? Yeah? You think you got me? Come on. Come on. What've you got? What've you got? Rrr, come on. Get off. What've you got? I'm gonna get this man, I'm gonna get it. It's mine. And I'm gonna put my whole body into it. Snausages. Snausages. Snausages. Snausages. Got your nose. Rrrr. What do you weigh? Ten times more than me? And you still can't get it from me? Yeah, that's right. You can't get it from Sox. Ow, I'm taking this. Yoink. Rrr. Rrr. Rrr. Destroy the evidence. No evidence. Nothing in here. Nothing to see here. Arrrr. Arrr. Arrr. From New York. How, if he was in Ohio, how did he get to Ohio without me knowing it? Went to Indiana, down to Florida. Went to... Doesn't make sense. How would he get to Virginia? Huh. I will find you. I will find him! All right now, it says we need to put that window. What's two? We need that little knabby thing. Where's the nobby? That? That's it. Yeah, I think. It's like some way... Wait, you need to put this steering wheel... We don't need a driver, per se. You know? They can just, you know, sit on the floor. I guess the passenger... You know? Someone can push the pedals. I guess the passenger... Hey! Hi. All right. Look, before you say anything, um... I know it's not perfect or even close to being done yet... but Jesse and I tried to stay up all night putting this back together for you and, um... well, you know what? I really just... I don't even know how you do these because these are impossible. Wow. That's a difficulty six, I'm impressed. And, we know you probably wanted to put it together... so we went out and found another car that we thought you would like to build. It's a Chevy. Like the other one. Actually, it's a Ford. Oh. Thank you, that was really nice. You're welcome. So, should we have breakfast? I'm on it. And why don't you take over for me, okay? Thank you. I'll go do what I'm best at doing. Yup. Tires are hard. Look. All I'm asking is for my partner here to sniff your dog. No. Come on, kid. It'll only take a second. Here, here. Want some candy? Oh, no, bad idea, bad idea. My Dad told me about people like you and told me not to trust them. Look, I'm sure he would understand. You see, Dale here is from the FBDI. He wouldn't understand and neither would Rex, here. Rex likes three people. Isn't that right, Rex? You know what? I think you're right. Let's go, Dale. I'm good. I'm good. Okay, okay. Tell me why we are, one, up so early? And, two, working on a Saturday? Because, Howie, we need to find that dog. You like your job, don't you, Howie? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it! Okay? That dog is the preeminent dog criminal in the nation. Huh? What's prepermanent? What? Bu-, you said, "Pre-enema? Prenuptial? Pre-?" Preeminent. Yes, that. So what? What's wrong with saying preeminent? Nothing, nothing. You just don't seem like the kind of guy... that would use that kind of word, pre-, uh? Pre-, uh? You want to go over to your side or do you want to drive? My side. You don't seem like the kind of guy... I read. That would use the word pre... You know, that's all. Well, I read, okay? I know stuff. What's wrong with that? You read? Yeah, I read. You got an issue with that? No, no. I'm just curious about what a person like you would read. You wouldn't know it. Are you implying that I don't read, sir? I would never. Then what are you reading? Just something I got off the clearance rack at the book store, okay? It's no big deal. Well, if it's no big deal then spill the beans. Uh-huh. It's a romance novel. What, what, what? I didn't... what? It's a romance novel. Jane Rawlins. A Love To Remember. Okay? You can laugh now. Jane Rawlins. That's rich. See? That's why I didn't want to say anything. The love story. Yeah, yeah. Love story. Wait, is it the one about the lawyer who falls in love with the death row inmate? Yeah, that's the one. Can we drop it already? No, no, no, he's got about a week to live. And she risks her career to save him from dying. Oh, that's rich. How do you know what happens in the book? How do you know what happens in the book, Dale? About the... book? Yeah. I'm, uh... Uh... we have to focus on something else... No, no, first... far more important. You tell me how you know what happened in the book. No, first thing is this dog. And in order, look at that. Look at what? That woman, that woman! That woman! It's that, uh, it's that Paula Preston with the neighborhood association. Her, yes, her. You need to talk with her. Yeah, maybe... Maybe she's seen the dog? Yes, because you're a local, so she would know you. She would understand these... All right, I'll be right back. Local things. Excuse me! Excuse me! Uh, pardon? Uh, hi, Howie Hagglestrum. Uh, Animal Control. And you... Beautiful. I mean, uh, uh... you, you, you haven't seen this dog, have you? It's missing. Oh, oh, pooh. Oh, a misplaced puppy. Poor puppy. Uh, uh, oh... Pretty plain pamphlet. Oh, well, we didn't have a lot to work with... but this dog means a lot to the owners. So, if you see anything, just... just give me a call. That's... that's my number... right there. Um, you can call anytime. Uh, well, I'll... keep my peepers patrolling. Well, uh, I... I have to get back to work, but if you hear anything... Uh... uh, well... Oh, what are you listening to? Oh, Pearl Jam, Prince and The Police. It's my power-walking playlist. Uh, I have to go. Oh... But, uh, seriously, if you hear anything, just let me know. All right. What's gotten into you, Twinkle Toes? It's a good workout, what can I say? Did you just do a pirouette? It really tightens up your midsection. You should try it. Yeah. Hey. Hey. Whassup? Sox, did you just talk in front of him? You knew about Sox? Yeah, of course I've talked to both of you. I'm surprised you both didn't know. You guys are brothers and you don't talk to each other at all. You should really start acting like brothers. Well, that's why I'm here. I thought that maybe, you know, we could... build this one together? Look... I know it was mostly Christina that built that last one. These are really hard to make. Hey, the kid's got smart fingers. He could give you a hand. Ha! Fingers, hand, get it? All I'm saying is that... these are a lot harder than you think. You'll probably just let me down. I just wanted to... Help? Yeah, I know. But... you really can't. Really? He's just trying to be your brother. You need to relax, man. What? I wasn't trying to be mean. Come on, kid, you're coming with me. There's something I want you to see. Rr, come on. Have a seat right here. Now just listen for a moment. It's Liam, he doesn't like me. Of course, he likes you, Jesse. That's impossible. He... he's mean, and he doesn't want to share Sox. He's my dog, too, you know? Oh, baby. Just give him some time, okay? Liam's a good kid. And if you give him a chance, he's gonna make an even better big brother. You promise? I promise. Do you think I'm a good little brother? Mm, only the best little brother ever. Sometimes I wish you and me were just happy and back to being a family again. Baby, we are a family here. We just need to, um, learn to love each other, that's all. You know, I'm sure it's tough for Liam, too. But we just have to stay strong, and know it will all work out in the end. Turn off the light! I can't, I'm afraid of the dark. You're afraid of the dark? I know, I'm a baby. Trust me, just turn off the light. Okay. Here, put this on. Yeah, baby, check me out. Underdog ain't got nothing on me. Have you ever heard the story about the junk men from Mars? Junk men? Oh, those guys. Yeah, they come to earth and they steal all of earth's most valuable treasures. Valuable treasures like my mom? Like Sox? Bring it on, Grandma Mars. Yeah, but they love everything that we love... except 60 billion times more. Why do they do that? Don't they have good stuff on Mars? Yeah, but not as good as earth. Earth's got way more cooler stuff than Mars. It's true. I met some guys from Mars. They're very boring people up there. All they want to do is play Minecraft. How do we stop them? No one really knows. I could stop them. I fought aliens before. Not like these guys. These guys are really tough. And really quick. I'm scared. Can you sleep in here with me? I may be small, but I've got the strength of a gorilla and the bite of a hippopopotatamus. Yeah, but we gotta take shifts. To make sure, you know, they don't come and just take Sox. Worry about yourself, kid. Or my mom. I'll take first shift. No, you get some rest. I'll take the first shift. Thanks, Liam. This has been the most fun time ever. Here, have a pillow. Get some sleep. Well played. Are we friends now? See? Now you're being cool. Good night, Liam. Good night, Sox. Sox! Sox! Where is that dog? Oh, there you are. Brought you some food. Hmm? All right, look. You're still on thin ice with me, Mister, okay? But I think I see you working the magic on the boys so, thank you. Come here. Mangy mutt. Who needs breakfast? - You guys good? - Yeah. Have some granola, too, there. Mom, last night was so cool. We stayed up all night with Sox. Hey, what was that for? Sox was in the house last night? Uh, I didn't let him in. And he kicked me. Then who let him in? Hmm? I didn't let him in. Jesse, did you? I didn't let him in, but he got in here and I don't know how. Okay, just so we're clear in the future, Sox sleeps in the dog house, okay? If Sox does something bad, he's in the dog house. Why are you just saying that to me? I didn't let him in. I'm speaking to both of you. It did kind of look like you were looking at Liam. - See? - Jesse. I'm just saying, Mom. It goes for both of you, okay? It actually goes for all of us. Sox is... he's all over the place right now. He needs to learn some manners. It won't happen again. Liam, I'm not blaming you. It won't happen again. Who could that be? It could be aliens, Mom. I'm coming with you. Well, come on then. Hi! Paula. Oh, my, I am so sorry. I completely forgot you were coming this morning. We got a bit of a, a late start. Um, if you, you know what? If you just give me a few minutes, I can just... Oh, please, proper preparation is paramount. I'll probably pop by later. Oh, that would be amazing. Thank you so much. She's totally an alien. She is the strangest lady ever. Yeah. I need to push past the beauty parlor and get a perm to prep for the pageant. Really? Oh, it's pretty popular. I participate every year. Sox, how did you get in here? Paula, I am so... I am so, so, so sorry. I am... boys, come on, come on! Get something, a towel, a paper towel, something... She was looking at you. She was looking at you. Boys! Just one of you, go get something, please! Come on, help! Mom, were you looking at me or Liam? Just somebody, go get something. Paula, I am so, so sorry, I... Don't bother! I'm fine! Words don't describe how sorry I really am, I am... I said I am fine, thank you! She's not saying any P words. She must be upset. Well, that is some dog you've got there. Well, he's special, and really special. I bet he is... really special! Interesting feet on him. They kind of look like... Socks. Uh, I don't suppose this happens very often? I've never seen it before, but I suppose things like this do happen every now and then. Anyway, um, I don't think we should have our recipe exchange after all. Good day! Huh! You are really in the dog house now, Mister. Who is it? Who is it? I don't know. Well, answer it! I'm answering it! Gosh. Hello? I possibly can point you to the proper place to find that misplaced pup! Paula? Precisely. Could, could you just say that one more time? Precisely. Oh, just say that just a little gentler this time. Excuse me? Uh, uh, nothing. Huh, nothing. Um, perhaps, I probably found your pooch. Could... could you just hold on for... for one moment? I think we may have found our dog. Woof! Oh, uh, no, no, no, no, not you. I'm so sorry. Um, yeah. Hang up. Okay, okay. Hang up. Yes, yes. Goodbye. We will see you at that address in, like, 15 minutes. Goodbye. Okay, love you, bye. Oh! Oh, no, shoot! Start the car. You think she heard that? She didn't hear that? No, no, no. I think she probably hung up before that, right? Probably, yeah, definitely. She didn't hear it. She hung up. Come on, over here. Come on, Sox, this way. Good boy. Good boy. Okay, right here. There you go. What is this? What is this? Huh? Oh, you've got to be kidding me. What is this doing in here? What is this? Uh, it looks like, uh, some bacon, O.J. Black coffee. But no sugar. He doesn't like that. But I didn't put it in there. I didn't... I don't know how it got there, either. So nobody knows how it got in here? No? Oh, you know, you know what guys? I know. Why don't we ask Sox how it got here, huh? Come here boy. Come here. Let me ask you something. Do you know how this got in there? Huh? Yeah? What? Oh, you, you can't, you can't tell me? What? Why? Why is that? Oh, because he's a dog. I didn't put it in here, and Jesse didn't put it in there. Mom, we were with you the whole time. You know what, boys? I think when your father gets home after his lecture tomorrow night... we're gonna have a long talk about this dog. What does that mean, Mom? It means that she's gonna take Sox away. You can't! You just can't! You guys, it's just really not a good time to have a dog right now, okay? Why? It's a lot of responsibility. It's something you guys don't understand. But Sox is our family now. We understand. We understand completely. You just don't like him. You say you want to be a family. Nice work, Christina. Come here, Sox. All right. You guys, you guys, Thomas will be home tomorrow night after his lecture, okay? Let's talk about it then, all right? Sox stays out here, okay? He sleeps out here. You guys understand? Now, look, I'm sorry, but he needs to learn some boundaries... if he has any chance of staying here, okay? Okay. Don't worry, guys. She's just blowing off a little steam. I'm not going anywhere. That's him. That's him. That's him all right. Ah! I'd know him if he was dipped in honey and covered in feathers... rolled around lightly floured with some salt, cinnamon, to taste. Only just, man, I hate to take that dog away from those poor kids. That dog is a criminal mastermind. Who knows what he's planning on doing to those poor, rotten people. Are you sure? He doesn't look that dangerous to me. Of course, I'm sure. You know, Howie, I'm beginning to think that you don't have the huevos... that it takes, that needs to be done. Like huevos rancheros? Huevos grande. Oh, I got the, look... Let's just... Can we just give 'em one more night together? We can always come back after lunch tomorrow. Sure. Yeah, sure, Howie, that's a nice idea. Yeah, why don't we do that? Why don't we give them one more night... to say goodbye. Nobody knows the trouble I've seen. Nobody knows... knows! SOX Let me go! Let me go! Guys, maybe he just went for a walk or something. I'm sure he'll be back. Sox wouldn't just leave. Yeah, he'd tell us. I bet he would. Someone must have took him. That, or you got rid of him last night and you didn't tell us. Liam! You know I wouldn't do something like that! Jesse. God, please help us to get Sox back. If you let us have him back, God, I'll be nice to Jesse. He's really not that bad. God, please, I'll, I'll even be nice to Christina. Anything you want me to do, God, I'll do it. Think it'll work? Mom says prayer helps with everything. God... Tommy, it's me. Um, look... I know you're probably on your way to your lecture right now... but something really horrible has happened and it's about Sox. And, I need your help like, like now. Okay? Please, please call me back. It's all about being there for your family... really getting past emotion, it's lar... I gotta remember to smile. It's not... do you have any idea where we are? Did you see an Exit 42? I'm the driver. I'm not supposed to be seeing Exit 42. You're supposed to be seeing Exit 42. You're the navigator. Did you see a diner? 'Cause I'm kinda hungry. Or a cactus. There seems to be a cactus in here. Yeah, I hate to interrupt 'cause you're on such a roll there... but, I think Christina just called you. Oh, no. Tell her I said hi, but not that I got lost. Please? I know you can do it, so do it. Talk! Talk! Not gonna happen. There. There. Ah-ha. There, you did it. I knew you could do it. And I got it all on camera. You do realize that I'm talking to your brain? The camera didn't pick anything up. Liar! Go ahead, play it back, then. Maybe I will. Got it all on camera! Liar. Liar. Maybe I will. Ooh, the big bad guy's plan is ruined. No, no, it's not. I will show the world your gifts, and I will be rich. Mm. Genius. Yes, I know, thank you. And BTW... you will not get anything to eat until you agree to work with me. You know what? I hear you... but, um, I already had your sandwich about, like 10 minutes ago... so, yeah, I'm good for a while. Pastrami. That was good. Okay, you didn't, you son of a... I feel so hungry. How did you do that? It's okay, baby. We're gonna find him, all right? We are, guys. We're gonna find him. I just know it, okay? It's okay. Tommy? Hi, um, uh, my name is Howie. I work with Local Animal Control. Oh, good. Oh, my God, have you... Have you found our dog, Sox? What do you mean? Did Dale come by? Who's Dale? Well, I have to tell you something about your dog. He's wanted by the FBDI and Dale was the Officer looking for him. FBDI? I don't... Uh, Federal Bureau of Dog Investigations. FBDI? You actually think that, that exists? Well, it sounded so professional, I didn't even think that... Look, your partner stole our dog. Where is he? Uh... I, I just got your message. What's... God, it's so good to see you. Where's Sox? What about your lecture? I don't care about a lecture, a lecture about trying to keep my family together... when my own is falling apart? Who's this guy? Uh, uh... Dog Catcher. He's one of the junk men! Oh, no, no, no, no, no! Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on here? We gotta go find Sox. What happened to Sox? One of the junk men from Mars took him. Uh, well, this guy that I was working for, uh... to catch what I thought was the nation's most wanted dog criminal... has been probably lying about everything, just so he could steal your dog. I'm an idiot, aren't I? But why Sox? Well, Donald did say that he was pretty special. Who's Donald? So, you've been chasing me for a while now, huh? Like, five years? Seven. Seven. Seven. Seven. Seven. Seven years. Me. Zzz. You. Huh. Wow. That's, um, that's a commitment there, huh? Five years? Just to make a little money off my gifts? What, what's wrong with wanting money? I'm not buying it. Nope. Sorry. Don't buy it. I think there's a little bit more to it there, Dale. What do you think? Money? What's the real reason? What are you hiding? Come on, Dale. Stop it. Stop it. Get out of my head. You can tell me. Out of my head. Go. Out. Shoo. Out. What are you hiding, Dale? Dale, what are you hiding? Come on, Dale, you can tell me. Stop it, stop it, stop it. I'll be your friend. Stop it! La, la, la, la. Just out what you mean, can you hear me? Stop it, stop it, stop it! I can't hear you. Dale? Dale? Ssh, stop it! Stop it! It's way too late for that. Stop! Stop it! Dale? Dale? Stop! Stop it! Dale, Dale, obey your dog. Because all I ever wanted was a talking dog! Okay? My best friend, my little beagle Scooter, he was my best friend. But, he couldn't talk. Go on. And he, he's gone. But you, you'll, you'll live forever and you can talk. You can talk to me. Come on over. It's okay, buddy. I just wanted a... a best friend. There, there. Oh. No, it's okay, Dale. There, there. Yeah, just rest your head. There, there Dale. It's all over. I knew there was something off about that guy. It was his smell. He smelled like the Jersey Shore. Oh, now that's a situation. Yeah. Anyway, uh, it turns out that the FBDI doesn't even exist. I probably should have looked that up earlier. Huh. Socrates. Where is Socrates? Socrates? His name is Sox. Liam, cut him a little slack. How did you know that? Did Socrates tell you that? Uh, guess it just seemed like his name. Yes! This is typical Socrates! He does it every time. I know, it's... Oh, my gosh. He's such a little rebel. You know he just loves the way Sox sounds, he just thinks it's so cool. Hm, you didn't tell me they found a family for him. Well, uh, uh, he... Who is this guy again? Are you a junk man from Mars, brother? Oh, no, I don't think I have any brothers from Mars. Did I ever tell you the story of how I met Socrates? Well, he came to me at a very special time in my life when I lost someone I loved. And he came and he mended my heart. You know, I think, I think he's doing the same for you two boys. Well, look, I have one question for you two. Are you two brothers? Yes. Yes. And you guys know how special Socra-, Sox is? Yeah. Yes. And do you guys love him very much? Yes! Yes! Well then, let's go find him! Let's go! Sox, Sox, Sox, Sox. Oh, boy, okay, stop right here. Okay, stopping. Left. No. Left. What is that? What? Where are you... Where are you going? What are you do... Get back in the... Oh, my God. Sorry. Hey, hey, hey. Come here. Stay here. Hey, hey, Liam. I'm okay. Where's Sox? I don't know, he left me. I guess he didn't want to be my best friend. Maybe because you stole him. It's all right, you guys. Maybe this isn't the end. We're gonna find Sox if it takes us all afternoon. We're gonna find him, okay? Yeah, and I'll stay here, and this lying liar... and make sure the police have a nice chat with him. Uh-uh. If I know Sox... and I know him pretty, pretty well. I would say he's right where he's supposed to be. Well, come on, I'll race you there! Wait a min... wait for us! Bad Dale! Oh! Sox. Oh, Sox, those are my clothes. Yeah, sorry about that there, princess. And there it is. You see it? What did I tell you about that there, guys. Faint City. Oh, hey, hey, hey. Go easy on me. Go easy. Christina? Hey, hey. Give me a second, all right there, fellas? I'm gonna go see an old friend. Donald, I'll be good here. Guys, breakfast is ready. Come on. Breakfast? Church this morning, let's get a move on. Race you to it, guys. Ooh, okay, come on. Looks delicious. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm excited to dig in. Coffee? Yes, please. Thank you, honey. Thank you. You're welcome. I'll take some bacon. Do you want some? No, no, no, don't worry about it. I'll just take a little... - Christina. - Thank you. No problem. Here you go. First breakfast as a family. Oops. Give me some of that greasy grub there, baby. Sox, watch it man. That's my wife you're talking to. Sorry about that. Did he just... Yeah, he did. It's the newest thing in dog technology. That's amazing! Yeah, it's all right. Yeah, it's nice. Dogs don't normally talk, right? Well, I guess I'm not your average dog, there, bucko. He drinks coffee? He does. Coffee, I'll drink anything, French roast, dark roast... white roast, it's all good. I like the roasts. Give me anything that's handpicked by Juan Valdez. No sugar there, babe. But if I want something sweet, I'll put you in my coffee. Could... could I ask you a personal question? Shoot. When we leave the house and we leave the TV on for you, do you like that? Eh, I guess it really depends on the show. You like the doggy channels, right? Animal Planet. I think we could, um... Don't get any ideas. - Yeah. No, no. No. - What about... Dealing with these dog catchers and they're crazy, so we're... You could do like a TV show. It's for the best, trust us. We don't want a TV show. It could make a lot of money. We could, we could, we're not going to. Yeah, you know what? I'm more of a radio guy. Well, there we go. When you leave the house, where do you go? I could tell you, but then I'd have to bite you. I'm okay with this, but did you wash your paws? Of course, I did. I'm no animal. I licked 'em spotless. That's kind of gross. Yeah. Part of the family. Mm-hm. From now on. For the record, I just want to let you know... I've been around for a while. I've had a lot of meals with a lot of different people. There's no other place that I'd rather be than right here with all of you. Now top off my coffee. Oh, is that bacon? I love bacon. Yeah, I wish it was sausage, sausage I can't get enough of. Well, I guess he's part of the family now. Aces. Look on the bright side. They'll let you read plenty of Jane Rawlins in jail. Mm. Sad, sad, sad.
