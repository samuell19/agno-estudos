BRESLIN: Jogging trip and a swim? JUL SHE SAID YES! You have three new voicemails and one saved voicemail. Breslin, it's Michael. I ran into your almost-wife Erin yesterday. I don?t know what she did, but she looks too damn. I'm just kidding, she was shitty. She has probably started with yoga. I would love to be her bicycle saddle... Get in touch. You're an emotional zombie. We can do this together, it's just biting. Bye. To delete the message - press seven. Perfect smile - Fine hair - Good skin - Ordinary NOT ERIN NOT ERIN Good morning. Good morning, Sasha. Can you cancel my meetings this afternoon? Yes, mr Kennedy. Breslin Kennedy Financial Advisor Do you make yourself at home? Bob Atkinson moves all of his three million dollar accounts. Write here. He's not losing any money, Kara. He earns no money either - his risk profile is zero. Your job is to make customers happy. But they leave, because you don?t make any money. I'm not losing either. Where is the stock shark we hired? Where has he gone? I've greased the head office, but you must not lose more customers. It's time to dump her and move on. Many people depend on you. And I would talk quietly about what we've done on your desk... - Breakfast in bed! - Clive Roberts famous pancakes. And some turkey bacon that was in your fridge. - What are you doing? - I must go. I thought you would be free. - It can not continue like this. - No, you can buy real bacon. You know what I mean. We can not continue like this. We have already tried that, right? There may be some chewing gum or patches we can try. I'm serious this time. We don't have to lie down every single time. But we do. It is fantastic. But you always go. - Back to your perfect wife. - She's not perfect. I should offer you condoms in different colors and refuse to kiss your mouth. It's not just hard for you, and you know it. It's awful to feel like this about a man... - Someone you like. - What do you want me to do? Just... Okay... We may see each other sometime. Sometime when it suits you. It might be faster than you think. I have some business trips and maybe I should sell the Clive Roberts Brewery. I hate to sound like this! That's not how I am. You are perfect. Have a nice week. Be brilliant with your brushes and blogs and everything. Mess me, if there's anything. I hate to mess... Shopping with Michael I'm fucked at work. This place is pure gold mine! You have no idea how often I get a pacifier. Here you see... Rachel, 22. I met her over at the loaf. Though she looks like a horse. Afterwards, I didn?t know if I should hug her or give her apples. Isn't Blackberry for people with jobs? - What are you doing this week? - I deliver newspapers. - Are you a newspaper boy?! - I prefer "newspaper man". - Nevermind. What does your list look like? - I have no list. Forgive me, you have no list. List, list - everyone has one. NAME: Mitch. AGE: Very old Job: Newborn player Who's Mitch Bingham? He's helping you get over Erin. Sure, you got hurt. But it does not help to have three cash conditions. And it will come from Player of the Year... I'm not a player. I have a list of unattainable women who only call me when they are bored. They don?t see me as a boyfriend. - Imitation crab...? - It is made from cod. In any case, try to meet someone who gets you back on your feet. Don?t take p?t?, it's for jons. And don't let the snotty name fool you. The snotty name... Like what - newspaper boy? Newspaperman! That's neither a pineapple nor a bat. This is unbelievable, Simone! The couple over there... They'll be divorced in three years. - Rather three months. - Check out his body language. - Did you see how he looked away! - You're paranoid. She's so proud of her ring. She drove in blackmail to get that ring. That's not good for an erection. It turns out to go on a slack line... He will left like crazy. - You're larval. - All men are unfaithful. They are not at all. Diamonds don?t make people hold together, it just gets harder to pull. Translation: you want Clive to leave his wife and be with you. - Are you the world's worst friend? - Yes. - How are the three musketeers? - They have nothing to do with this. Who? The other three guys you meet next door? - When was the last time you saw each other? - Last night. And this morning. How was it? Confusing, passionate, amazing! And I'm ashamed, because his sweet wife was probably sitting at home knitting. - Simone, it's time to move on. - You don?t say... All men are players. It is important to give back with the same coin. I've met a cutie. CLIVE: Great to see you. Busy the next few days. - Okay... - Believe me. Dinner with Heather Fairly thick and no bumps. What if it was always like that... - Was that a cock? - No. I've never fixed this, so I hope it's okay. Oh my God! It's delicious. Taste it here. - It will be a bit much. - Taste. How do I get it in my mouth? It takes a spider role for men to understand that fear... Turn it on silently! Why does everyone have bacilli fear?! Children should be allowed to play in mud puddles again. Then I'm done. Now it's time for you to undress. Wait. We must think for sure. - Safety comes first. - Come on, Jacob! Every time? Do you know how many bacilli and protozoa thrive on the hands? - You'm cheating. - Is this enough? No, you have to get all the way up to the elbows. And then... No, wait. I have to lubricate my hands properly. Train with Dani - Worst thing you are silent today. - Sorry, I was thinking of something else. We only meet twice a week. Say what it is. I might get fired. I would not let you go unemployed. - How do you mean? - You get to be a model in my crochet class. - What are your benefits? - You know what your benefits are... Why are you still single in your profile? Where did that come from? I just want to know if you see yourself as single. I clicked in it because I didn?t want to be too personal. You didn?t have to write anything. "Single" means you are available and looking. NAME: Colin AGE: 34. JOB: Musician Imagine this... I can 't imagine anything right now. My band was on stage at The Westwood two nights ago. - Have you been to The Westwood? - I was there, Colin. - Were you? - Yes. Sorry, old lady. I didn?t see you in front of an audience. There were only twelve of us. It's the same twelve every time. There were others there as well. In all cases... I thought we owned that night. Which reminds me... I have something to ask you. Do I want you to turn that off? Yes. Okay... What would you say if I asked you to be our manager? It's flattering. It really is. But I can not right now, I have a lot of stuff going on. Someone must have spiked my grass because it sounds like you're refusing to lead a great band. I can not, but I'm still your biggest admirer. We need admirers. Wedge away now. You, my darling... ...is like a mantis. Be glad you have your head left. Stick now. CLIVE: Have been thinking about you all day. SIMONE: Want to meet you! Hate this... BRESLIN: Meet Kara SIMONE: Painting course Hey, Kara. I'm getting a little late. No, I went in good time, but the traffic is awful. I'm trying to get around. Sorry, I'm doing my best. I don?t know what to say... - Say you know your legs! - I'm standing on them! - My bike...! Oh my God! - Sorry. How did it go? - I want to call a lawyer. - I can print a check. - Come on! - And I'm buying a new bike. Blood at the crime scene - bad luck for you! - Get a Ford Bronco instead. - I'm not going to knit. Can I look at that? And... - It will hurt a little. - It already does. - Sorry. - I'm just kidding. So there. I almost forgot the most important thing! So there... - And then the bike... - The phone also broke. - I fix both the phone and the bike. - I want a new phone... And... $1,000 for the bike. - $1,000 for that one? - It was almost antique. Sure, we say so. There is a mobile shop around the corner. May I take a picture of you by the bike in case you sue me? Which I should do. I look better from this point of view. Can you imagine smiling? - Why? I am not happy. - Smile, please. Great. - You can have it as a screensaver. - Let's go. - Do you want a ride? - Would it be safer? Follow me. Be sure to get there. - Can you take it? - Sure. - Do you want the same phone? - Don?t stress, I'm shocked. Welcome! Sorry if I was scared. My name is Joe. He ran over me and broke my phone, and maybe some bones... I want to report a car accident. The culprit is here! I'm kidding, I didn?t call the cop. Because you'm kidding about the car accident. The guilty one. - He pays. - You can drive on me. - Feel free to... - Look around a bit. What do you do when you are not swaying around on the street? Full-time blogger, part-time artist. Could I see something you've done? No thanks. That one is cash. The keyboard is good... - I hate to mess. - Who hates to mess? - But you're messing right? - Yes, but I would prefer carrier pigeons. They may have some cans and some string to sell. - I want this. - Don?t take it. Trust me. - Joe! - Here I am! Reach? This one has everything you need, right? Correctomundo. - And you like this one, huh? - More than a friend. Which is not entirely healthy. - I'm taking your darling. - Good choice. I'm just going to run and get a new copy. When will I receive the rest of the payment? -When I meet you again. Then so, then we drive. A few quick things, you're Nick Cage. - What...? - "Gone In 60 Seconds". A joke. The man who arrives on time! I'm gonna kill you... Forgive me! - Surely HBO has saved our marriage? - TiVO is better than HBO. - TiVO is an aid. - You can be yourself... I love TiVO! I'm watching that reality series about the polygamist. - I've seen it. - Have you seen it, Breslin? A guy has to choose between a lot of women... -...but he can only take three. - They were something, that. BRESLIN: Did we just have a date? SIMONE: No! You drove on me. BRESLIN: It felt like a date. You can watch the DVD with us. I can buy it for him. But thank you, that was nice. - Can you wait until after dinner? - Sorry. How can he keep track of them all? Everyone's schedules and personalities. It's so nice to meet you, Breslin. Kara has not said that you are so... handsome. Finally, we are even couples. We should do this every week! Are you sending a patent, Breslin? So you found here. It's not that easy. I have a GPS. No one gets lost anymore. Then it's not a sport. - As promised. - Thanks. - You can count, if you want. - I trust you. Thanks for watching. - Be careful, I can break my foot. - Then you should move it. - That would be true in most cases. - But not in this case? Anyone who removes the foot can see the door open another day. - Are you going to answer? - Yes. Hey! Yes, it fits well. - This is... - Why are you bringing me here? - It's close to work. - I don?t like coffee for 5 dollars. You never pay. You should keep these investments. And here you can invest 20,000 of your grandfather's money. No, I don?t want to talk to you. - Who was it? - One on the list. - Which of them? - One of the Asians. - So the ringtone is... - Yes, I divide them by ethnicity. Can you concentrate on this for a minute? I want another advisor. Then I get fired, and then it's your fault if I get homeless. - That was very unprofessional. - Yes, I'm not proud. Invest 100,000 in the stock you like - Inter-sol. - Okay. Welcome to Las Vegas. - How are the brides? - I've met a new one. - That's the spirit! Hear more. I drove on her while she was cycling. - From behind? - Shitty! Perfect shape. - Did you run over her from behind? - Yes! No, straight from the front. Soft... When are you going to meet next time? - I can not, I'm busy. - Yes, by three other women. You know what? You kill me with your bullshit. I promise... Look at me. I'm not your friend, unless you sharpen up. They will never go up against Erin. The bike girl seems to have woken you up. Try it, see what happens. She was very good looking. Here we have the redhead! Damn... Okay. I would like to talk more about all your problems, but I'm going to teach a "cougar" to play the piano. - You don?t play the piano. - We never get that far. No danger, I bid. Again... BRESLIN: Hey, Simone... SIMONE: Do you miss me already? BRESLIN: What do you think of $5 coffee? SIMONE: Must be organic. BRESLIN: Money is not everything, but you get good coffee anyway. SIMONE: Must stop, will blog. Three things you can not buy for money: 1) A guy to drink coffee with... - What do you think? - Fin. Take it too. See you at the checkout. BRESLIN: Hi Simone... Just that... You hate to mess. You actually called! Hi... I would like to invite you to dinner in a nice place. - We have just met. - I want to compensate you for the accident. - What a nice garter belt holder! - Take it too. - Sorry... - Are you busy? - No, there's no danger. - But it's me. Bye! - Bye... This will make you feel better. The main ingredient is J?germeister, which is healthy. One more. Down with it, just. I want a painting of me with a bouquet of lilies in my arms. - Where did that come from? - I have started to visualize the day. Then there will be lilies. You should update your Facebook profile. - You seem to be pulling on it. - I may delete my account completely. You should not think I'm going to let this go. I hope to see a change soon, otherwise you have nothing to pick up from this girl. Just wait! Soon I'll want to meet your parents. "Not the parents!" My mother said that if a boy calls me twice, he likes me. My mother is heavily medicated and my father is a male bimbo... ...so I do everything to avoid them. What is your relationship status on Facebook? None - the options were so boring. - Have you blown all the money yet? - No, they're in my aquarium. - There you get no return. - The clownfish casts lustful glances. - Are you okay? - Yes. Did you want to talk about something? No, nothing special. See ya. Bye. The game version of me has absolutely incredible skills! Glad you're playing with yourself, literally... Hey you! No, there is no danger. I'm just about to run a workout. How will it be tomorrow night? Why? No, I understand. I understand. Yes. Okay, we'll hear from you soon. You also! Bye. - What do you recommend, Marcus? - Against what? Pain! - Acupuncture works. - But it's expensive. How about "blackupuncture"? Did I end up in the friend zone? Hi, Breslin. I got the message about your problems at work. Do as I do - expect nothing and be happy if something good happens. When I say it out loud, I realize how cynical it sounds. I need a therapist. Maybe you do too. See you at seven. It is best that you drink properly. I'm starving. That's not starvation, it's called food cravings. The socio-economic difference is huge. When do you have the next gig? I havn't seen anything on Facebook in a long time. We save to make an LP, so we don?t play live for a while. But I thought you made money on gigs. Most bands do, but we still pay to play. It's too damn, because we have a phenomenal sound. Nobody has taken it, which is too damn. This is the tastiest egg sandwich I've ever eaten. Why don?t you start working part time somewhere? It would be more convenient. It should not be practical. Then I would not live out my dream. That would be amateurish. Like you with your painting. Yes exactly. Amateur... The world's tastiest sandwich. I have been evicted... I have been evicted! Holy shit! Thanks for lunch, see you. Three things you can not buy for money: 2) To live your dream... I've been longing for this all day! Where are they? I don?t think I'll stand tonight. I have so much to think about. We are not in the office now, and your boss, I mean, wants you to concentrate on us. Okay... Kara, stop! Come on! I'm sorry. I don?t know what's wrong with you, but you have to fix it. I will. I go and shower. Moget... HEATHER: Hey! When should I show my nice underwear? Hey hottie! I don?t know who you are, but we should probably talk. KARA: Had to go. Sorry I was so weird tonight. The guy in front of me on yoga farted right in my face. Fy! No nice fumes, then. - Pure biological warfare. - I should check that you's okay. - I don?t know, it's quite late. - Do you like Chinese food? - Your favorite. - Come in, you crunch ball. - Mine does not look right. - There is no right, it's art. If you transfer what you see to the canvas, it's perfect. - Have you painted all the paintings? - Yes. It's something I have not burned. - Are they for sale? - No. Why not? You're talented, Simone. Have you considered investing in a studio, gallery - the whole choir? No, that's not why I do it. I do it for my sake. In addition, one must be dead or cut off an ear. You don?t have to influence an entire culture, just make some money. - What have you blogged about today? Conditions. What is your position? I don?t know if guys can be faithful today. There is too much noise, too many possibilities. What would be required to be faithful? That you dared. According to my grandfather, a millionaire is someone who earns a million ten times, and loses it nine times. So you have to go on some rivets. - Is it too fast? - No, it's not. Yes. Forgive me. Everything is so messy right now. Now you are too. No danger, it is water soluble. Serious? In the eye? It flows into the eye. Ouch! It hurts a lot. Wasn't that a little exaggerated? CLIVE: Hey, old lady. Sorry, but I can not tomorrow either. SIMONE: You're right, Dani. Time to try something new. - How's it going, Cyclops? - I'll probably survive. Who knows? Maybe I'm suing you. - Nothing I can wash myself with? - No, the color suits you. Hi, it's Simone. I had a very nice time and would like to meet you again. Call, if you feel the same way. Girls can say that these days, right? Hope I don?t seem strange. Hey, Breslin! It's Dani. My cousin is in town and would love to meet you. See you tonight at the gallery. It's Kara. Looking forward to tonight. I love that restaurant. Hi, this is Heather. Longing for tonight. The food is delicious. - Hello! - I must have messed up. - I can not see you tonight. - Why not? I'm going to have dinner with a client, and then I'm going to the opening. - Where then? I can get there. - I only have one place on the guest list. - We'll see you another time. - Sure. BRESLIN: You're right, Michael. It's time for something new. Meeting with Jacob, Marcus, Colin Colin! How's the band going? How good at all. We'll do an LP. We may end up on iTunes. Jacob! Men! Is everything okay? I'm working on. Good luck with the match tomorrow. Gentlemen, holster your weapons. I have gathered you here today, to say that I can no longer have any dealings with you. - This is your farewell interview. Define "balances". No more sex or socializing afterwards. You?! I feel it's time for me to try something else. Feedback and comments are welcome. - It's the guy who drove you. - Breslin, yes. - Who's Breslin? Have you checked yourself? - Everything is green. Are you sure about this? I think I can speak for everyone. We probably don?t fix a lot of whining, if you change your mind. - If you do this, it's so. - Then it's so. - Anything else? - Are you dumping the married guy too? He should be here too. - I didn?t want to ask him to come here. - Severance pay, then? - I can imagine a square. - No, no, no! - Then you get to watch. - Probably me. And I would panic if I saw how well-hung Marcus is. Not because I want to see it... There will be no square! Hi, Mary. It's Colin. - Time to go, Jacob. - Simone... Hi mom. Can you come and get me? I know you just let me go. I've been dumped. - The lamb is perfect. - I want to talk to you. Do you know who also eats small sweet lambs? The wolf. - That's something I want to say. - And there are wolves in sheep's clothing. - May I say something? - Can I have some more fucking wine! - Sorry... - May I bid on Chianti? - Good bones and body. - Thank you, Heather. No reason, Kara. Let me pour. But how rude I am. Mr Kennedy. Can your client have another glass of wine? I'm sure I get it. Please refill, Heather. Your life is just a father and I hope you're hit by a bus. Not that you die, but become paralyzed and have no use for the cock! Wait, I forgot! Mrs Amini, your client asked to get another advisor today. You have five minutes to clean out your office on Monday morning or someone else does. That felt safe. More wine? Ladies and gentlemen... Excuse me, I have some postmodern art waiting. I don?t know if it matters, but I'm sorry. Really sorry. This is carbon, and I wanted to capture the mood of a black and white photograph. The focus here is the eyes and I am very happy with the image. All my works have one thing in common - vulnerability. I want to see people without their masks and you do that in this work. Thank you! Take something to eat and drink and enjoy the art. - Hello! Did you like it? - I am so proud of you. The lilies were very beautiful, thank you. - What has happened to you? - What amazing stuff! I love them all, they are so inspiring. Breslin? What a surprise to see you here. What a surprise to see you. What are you doing here? Dani is my art teacher. - Have you been here all along? - Yes almost. Great stuff! They really capture... ...a self-imposed isolationism and a social failure. You don?t know what you are talking about. - What happened to your shirt? - A small incident, only. It looks like a Rorschach test. It makes me think that my father ignored me. You probably know each other. -Simone and I bumped into each other recently. It was a bicycle accident. - How do you know Dani? - We are friends. - Friends? - We know each other. I thought I was your girlfriend. Yes... I think I need to time-out, and you have to get out of here. This is my big night. It was really obvious, that you're such a guy. I should be ashamed. It's Michael. Sorry I didn?t call, but I've been tied up. Literally... Long story short. Too bad it messed with the bike girl, but still right for you. Now you have time to sit at home and dream about Erin. Call me, I promise to answer. Forgive me for being late. - I meant what I said last time... - I left her. - What did you say? - I came here as soon as I could. We talked during dinner and I told you all about you. How crazy I am for you, and Simone... I feel free. I needed a fresh start, and I can get that with you. - How is she? - She is fine. It comes so suddenly. Why right now? I could not play theater anymore. Thank you for your patience. - Clive... - I love you! I want you in my life. Now it's the final game. Jen moves out his stuff, and then we have the apartment to ourselves. Is that your phone? Do you need to answer? Sasha... Disgusting - Probably homeless - Dating worse - Never dating worse NOT SIMONE Welcome to my office, Romeo! - So you intend to put down love? - No. I messed up, she quit. It's just details. You really like her, maybe even love her. I don?t want to date any women for a while. Then I can introduce you to some nice single guys. - Have you given her a mixed band yet? - No. Has she not received a mixed tape? What's with you? A mixed band is the best way to get a girl interested. Especially if with a little PM Dawn and Keith Sweat. It's not 1980, there are no cassette tapes anymore. You need to burn a CD or get a USB memory stick. We need to get the love train back on track. I know! Come to my retirement bowling this afternoon. It changes your life. I'm not retired. It is enough that you are of legal age. I can see it in front of me... How you compete against a lot of old people. How about this picture, then? I almost had a threesome yesterday. - Almost? - I got too drunk. - Limp Bizkit...? - Soft as a marshmallow. - Freshly pressed. - I'm content with whiskey. - Is it part of a master breakfast? - What is this? We can sculpt together. Or I stick out my eyes. - You can store all art stuff. - I don?t want that. I'll take everything with me. That early work too? It's one of my favorites. - The fishermen should get a real aquarium. - They like their aquarium. If you get a better home, can they get it too? - Where are you going? - I have to run. - Running or driving? - I have to work. I have two women to pay for. God have mercy... My God, how dry! WELCOME, PENSIONERS! - An oven glove? - I warm my hand. - The senior league, then. - The world's most dangerous league. It has the most deaths. I beat everyone but him, Mitch Bingham. He has become club champion 37 times. Mitch, this is Bres. Bres, Mitch. I wiped the globe with this one. Are you taking me by the hand anyway? Nice to meet you, sit down. - Does he have more girlfriends than you? - No, it went to the pipe. Excuse me. Incomming call. You never know. Norma will be tonight's winner. She probably wants to test her new hip. Now it's my turn. She's sure... I hate when he does that. Breslin needs help, and you're the right man for the job. Oh really? Give me the background. He was dumped by three girls, vomited and was fired. And he's met a girl he's crazy about. It is easy. If you like the girl, give the iron. No lists, no online dating, no messing around or Facebook. No more Myspace or any other fireplace. You need to get off the network. - It is your turn. - My turn... Come with me. Having fun has its time, but then it's time to have a loving relationship. I got married when I was 18, but suddenly I would save the world from having to speak German. But my marriage lasted for 55 years. I loved my wife as long as she lived. - I'm sorry. - We had a wonderful life. I feel sorry for you. You know what, Breslin? You're scared, it's visible to you. You can be afraid, but it's just fear. It's just a problem if you let it paralyze you. Don?t let it do that! - Thanks. - No problems. Have a good life. And you Breslin... Don't go for it again. Come on, Mikey, you fool! I'll show you how. Do you hear? It's dementia knocking on the door. - I'll all show you dementia. - You're old as hell. Hi, Simone. It's Breslin Kennedy. I don?t know why I said my last name... I miss our conversations and I have some things I want to say. Call when you have time. Hi, Simone. Breslin again. I know you'm disappointed with me. Then we are two. Please call. I have something I want to give you. When can I come by? Now, maybe? Today? Call, and I'll get by and greets you. Bye. Hi, Simone. You have not heard from you, so I'll come by with what I want to give you. No excuses, I promise. I'm going to your house for a profit and a loss. Bye. - Hi... - Not now. I ruined your old one, so I bought this one. I can not speak right now. And so I have done this. It's a mixed band. On a usb memory. "Megamix"? I who have never had a mixed band before... Everyone is worthy of a mixed band. - Play it and think of me. - Please go. - I'm just going to set this up. - Let it stand in the hall. - I'm just going to set it up. - Hello! - Is that one of the musketeers? - My name is Breslin. Clive Roberts, microbrewery. Do you want to taste? It's refreshing. - No, I'm driving. - To the circus? - I'm kidding! It's very cute. Simone said she had dispersed the herd of boyfriends. Sorry, but what flock are you talking about? She called you "The Three Musketeers". Or was it the Blackberry guys? I'm not a Blackberry guy. - Am I? Come on, Breslin. There is nothing to be ashamed of. You knew each other and I knew what was going on. This is fascinating... I'll probably go now. I bought a lock, just in case. Here's the receipt. If you want a different color, or a bike with only one saddle. Sell the shit on e-Bay. - Where is he? - Go in, I'm fixing this. If he ransacked my car, I'll kill him! Get up. Someone should have told you to wear it silently. I didn?t think my life could get any worse. - It was a misjudgment. - I'm sorry about that. You should not ask if you don?t want an answer, so I don?t ask who he is. I've been chasing him for a while. He has left his wife for me. It really is not what it looks like. No, you probably don?t have a deal, with some extra guys on the side. They knew each other, no one was fooled. You're no less screwed than I am, are you? And you were disappointed in me. Wait! Don?t go. I really want to sort this out with you. Tell Clive that his oil plug is leaking. I love Clive Robert's beer. I can not stand myself. Do you know what, my friend? This will probably help. The other day I read that the sun, which we see every day, will grow so large, that it devours the whole earth and kills everything. Not so soon, but one day the earth is gone. Think about it for a moment. This is something you have to accept. Supernova? No, the nonsense. You can not change the fact that the earth will be murdered by solar or that you're crazy about that girl. Apply the principle of meaninglessness to your life and be free. You are screwed, she is screwed, you are perfect for each other. I've smoked weed in that horn all day, so I forgot... - You didn?t even sleep with her, did you? - No. Haven't your bullets fallen down yet? Yes? No? Perhaps? Are they like little ovaries in there? Weird... Now I got an idea. BRES: Surprised you didn?t remove me as a friend. BRES: I'm really sorry. - DANI: How's Simone? - BRES: She does not answer. Some tips? DANI: Are you asking me for help?! You didn?t turn off the shower, Al Gore... - Someone is using it. - You are ugly! Please, I'm bouncing back as fast as LeBron. Sorry for that with Breslin. I didn?t know you were together. We were never really together, and he never looked at me the way he looks at you. - And how is it? - You know that. Breslin is a player! It is over. I'm done with him. I'm with Clive now. You know what? I have nothing to do with it, but you know what you're getting into with Clive? I need say no more. But with Breslin... I don?t know. I think there's a prince under his green reptile skin. I'm with Clive. It gets better that way. It will be safer that way, you mean. You're not sure enough, you should wear a helmet. - I don?t cycle, I went here. - I mean when you go. You should wear a helmet at all times. That would be super-safe. - Please stop. - Do you know what such people are called? - Yes... - Good. Don?t become one of them. - Into the shower, with you! - Bye. DANI: I deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. You get a chance... Raoul? Today we are going to take the concept of "character study" very literally. We'll use the drawing to see. Artists must challenge themselves. It's easy to say no. We have to go below the surface, and find both the good and the bad. Everyone has both parts. Sorry to interrupt, but I want to talk to Simone. - What are you doing here? - I want to talk to you. You have to go, I work. - Can 't you give me a chance? - No. You don?t go to this class. - Then I want to do it. - You can sit there. Sure? It depends on how much you want to stay. - Hi, my name is Jerry. - Hey, Jerry. - Now? - Focus... Simone... One day when I was driving I was inattentive, and you drove on me. Did I run over you? That would not be stated in the police report. I drove on you. You hit my face in my windshield. - And... - Your whole life changed? - Yes. - Oh really? In which way? Now I am aware of what I have in front of me. Simone... I think we have something and I would like to develop it. - What do you suggest? - That we give it a chance and dare. Our respective luggage seems to exceed the weight limit. - We have unpacked our bags. - Do you think that's enough? No, but you don?t have to plan your whole life with me. Have a cup of coffee with me tomorrow and we'll see. - Are you inviting me? - I try like just that. Soon I will send Jerry a note with "yes", "no" and "maybe" on it. Or I can just sit here. AND - Yes? - Yes. Can I leave the naked guy now? Never cancel my meter lesson again! Three things you can not buy for money: 3) To dare... Congratulations, partner. Art is risky enough for you. I can not be a journalist all my life. And art dealers sound grown up. I'm proud of you. Forward with the wallets! These artists are shitty. - The drinks are free all evening. - Open bar! So that's me? Is that my portrait? - Am I the tree? - No, you're all. - It's brilliant. - The tree looks like it has a vagina. She thinks you have girl parts. - I want to buy it for Mitch. - You're trying to sell it! How about 10,000? I pay in cash. You just became a real artist! - Shall We Dance? - Of course. - Won't you invite me? - I'm not dancing. If we're going to dance, you can talk dirty. - How filthy then? - Really filthy. And you may not quote replicas from the "Diary". - I have to see what you're for. - Are you ready? I believe that Optimus Prime stands for the world's foremost robot leadership. - My name is Michael. - It doesn't matter. Subtite by NEON
