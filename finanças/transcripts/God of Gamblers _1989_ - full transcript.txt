DATA FILE KO CHUN, AMERICAN-CHINESE, AROUND 36 YEARS OLD NO OTHER DETAILS, NO CRIMINAL RECORD LIST OF CASINOS HE IS NOT WELCOMED AT Mr. Ko Chun. I am the manager here. We welcome you to our casino. But the directors have just decided to cut your stake from 50,000 dollars to 1,000 dollars. The God of Gamblers. We arrived in Tokyo on January 3rd. Ko Chun's rival is Mr. Komiyama today. He's the second best gambler in Japan. Ko Chun said if he wins, I can have a holiday in Hong Kong and visit my friends. I hope this time, it comes true. Mr. Ko, it's all ready now. Don't you understand? It is a tie today if each person wins once. Tell him that if I win only once, I will take that I've lost. Mr. Ko said to consider him a loser if he wins only once. The first game is mahjong. You'll each take 14 tiles to complete a win. See who gets the highest point. Is that all right? You'll each take 14 tiles to complete a win. The one with the highest value wins. For instance, 4 Nine Characters tiles will give you a value of 360,000. Begin! Stop. Mr. Komiyama, 790,000. Mr. Ko, 800,000. Mr. Ko wins the first game. The second game is the dice. Sir, I want Ms. Reiko to replace me. All right. For the second game, the lowest score wins. Six points for Ms. Reiko. Mr. Ko. You were getting ahead of yourself earlier. This cup is too light. Can I have a heavier one? Sorry, I tried too hard. Only five dice. You really are a god. Five to six. It's your win. Please. -Cheers. -Cheers. Mr. Ko, you deserve this 500,000 dollars. The whole world knows you are the God of Gamblers. I knew that I would lose today. I just didn't believe that you are so good. Why did you gamble with me then? It's just an excuse for a gambler. I'd like to spend one million dollars to ask Mr. Ko a favor. Tell me. The Singapore King of Gamblers, Chan Kam-shing. Do you mean the one who is wanted by many countries and is hiding in international waters? Three years ago, my father represented our club to try to win a den in Osaka. The other club sent Chan Kam-shing to gamble with my father. Chan Kam-shing cheated to win. Then, my father killed himself. I have been practicing hard for the last three years. I am meeting Chan Kam-shing in two months to have a final game with him near Hong Kong. I don't have the confidence to win. I might need to resort to weapons to avenge my father. You can solve it yourself. But my boss told me this last month. The two clubs have mended their differences. He ordered me not to take down Chan Kam-shing with weapons. But... I won't be able to avenge my father through gambling. Do you want me to gamble with him on your behalf? -Yes! -Think it over, Mr. Ko. Chan Kam-shing is cunning. If he knows what you're up to, you'll be in trouble. Don't do it. If you don't agree, I won't be able to avenge my father. I am too ashamed of myself to live. Your death is not my concern. But at least, wait until I have a game with Chan Kam-shing. So you agree? I will never forget your help. When the game is over, just buy me a nice box of chocolates. Mr. Dragon! Let me introduce. This is Mr. Ko Chun. He is Mr. Dragon. Mr. Dragon is a good friend of mine. He doesn't gamble. But he can solve any problem outside of gambling. Nice to meet you. You're Vietnamese? Chinese immigrant. You used to be a soldier? Captain of the 19th Company, South Vietnam Special Infantry Unit. He will be your bodyguard until the day of the game. I don't think it's necessary. Call me at this number when you reach Hong Kong. I'm telling you, fix the air-conditioner or I'll take the bus. Hey, too much air-conditioning is not good. I'll be right back after collecting the money. Look how confident I am. Then look at the one across. It's obvious that he'll lose. Let's see the first one. He has eight points, but we have ten points. Shut up! Three sides... Three sides! More! I need more! More... Great! I have eight points as well. A tie. Banker wins! Hey! But it's a tie. It's the rule here. A tie means the banker wins. Bullshit. This is my village and my place. I set the rules. I say the banker wins. Get lost or I'll throw you out. Fuck you! Stop eating chocolates. It's fattening. Smoking gives me cancer. Chocolates make me fat. Help me finish it then. Yee, go with Janet to Crocodile's villa. I have a game with him tonight. Yes, Mr. Ko. Gambling again? I'm just having a look. The sunset is so romantic. Hey. Had enough romance? I have to study the horse races for tonight. Why can't you find a steady job? When will you save enough money for marriage by being a punter? Do you know? One can make a living out of gambling. I'll get rich if I win a big game. I am an elite. I can't live down there in the cheap houses when they're living up there in the Spanish villas. -Really? -Listen. I will be rich one day. I will buy all the Spanish villas up there and those bastards will have to live down there. What about me? By then, you will have the biggest one. I'll live down there for now. Let's go. Hey, I don't need to be carried. Hey, this is a private road. What are you doing here? Did you come here to steal? -What would I steal? Your curry? -Right! This is your road? The road is uneven and the fences are broken. Are you trying to get people killed? Yes, to get rid of punks like you. -Punks? -Hey! -No, stop! -Don't stop me! -You bastard! -Don't let me see you punks again or the dogs will get you. -You're the punk. -Yes! -Gosh. -Hey, watch out! You threatened me with the dogs and called me a punk? Hey, don't forget. That Indian guy leans on the railing all the time. -Make it loose. -Okay. It's a dark night tonight. When that Indian falls in the trap and leans on the railing, he will fall and roll all the way down. Go and pee over there. Over there? Of course, he'll fall right into your piss. Knife, you're incredible. -Go on, then. -Okay. Call, 300,000 dollars. Raise one million. It's only a two pair. But there's no reason not to take a risk. One million, call. Looks like I have a better hand. Raise two million. Crocodile, stop before it gets worse. Crocodile, stop before it's too late. Go home to your wife. Good night, everybody. Crocodile, you brought a good friend tonight. We were supposed to play through the night. He's very sleepy. Let him leave. -Yee, wake the driver up. -Yes. Crocodile, are you really leaving? Yes. -Let's continue tomorrow night. -Let him go. He can't afford to lose. What? I can't afford? You must be Mr. Nam. You can call me Mr. Nam if you have manners. Or else, don't waste my time. As we are in a good mood tonight, I'll stay and play with you. Mr. Ko. Am I welcomed? Of course, you are. Mister, you must be tired after dealing the whole night. Take a rest. Miss. Do you mind drawing the cards? -I don't know how to. -That's why I want you to do it. No one is objecting. Deal the cards. Okay. Ace to call. Five hundred. Nonsense. The minimum is one thousand. Five hundred? I meant, five million. Don't pull tricks! I have the Ace. Try another game if you won't call. What? Everyone is folding? Hey. It's only an Ace and a two. Thank you so much, then. These two are yours. These are mine. Keep them. Thanks. This one is for the next game. Deal the cards, miss. Look. Ace to call. I'll follow you. One million. So? I will call one million. And I'll... raise another three million. So, are you going to call? What about you, Mr. Nam? And this one? Fold. Well? Thanks! Deal the cards, please. Your turn. It's only a Queen. I place three thousand. I'm so lucky tonight. Pair of Queens to call. Two million, then. Are you that lucky every hand? I follow with two million. Plus everything you have. Mr. Nam, now you're being tricky. I have no choice. Mr. Nam started it. I have to follow. Miss, deal the cards. Gosh. The ten dropped out. Well, I can still stay. Know who you're dealing with. Mr. Nam, I know you can't be fooled. But you can afford to lose. Three Queens. You... Count the winnings. No loss tonight. Isn't that lucky? Mr. Ko, let's play again another day. Thanks! You won ten million from him last time and I got nine million back tonight. It's not too much, is it? Don't push too much. Good night, everybody. See you. Mr. Nam, what do we do? Call Scarface. Stop his car, kill him and get the check back. Yes, sir. Keep the check. Yee, take Crocodile down the road and take the bus. Why? There's no free lunch in this world. Be careful. Give me the phone. Let's go. -Hello? -Mr. Nam. How is it, Scarface? I couldn't stop them. I told you to stop their car. I couldn't stop the car. Why? They took the train. SELF-DEFENSE Don't kill me. Where are you from? We’re from North Vietnam. We came to earn a living. Please don’t shoot me. SELF-DEFENSE You're both Vietnamese, why did you do that? He's from North Vietnam. You take care of it. I'll go first. Go ahead! -Go on! -Go on! -Still a head's length. -Go on! -Quick! Just a little bit! -Faster! -Just a little bit! -Quick! -I told you so. -Great, you lost again! -Crow! -Yes! You are useless! -What's wrong? -Did you pee on a grave? -No! -Did you say sorry? -Yes! -Yes? Shit! You're useless! Why? Boss, don't hit me on the head. Shut up! You do it. I'll help you, you idiot! Go burn some incense and apologize! Hey! My friend, you are handsome! Swear on God! What did you say? You don't understand Hindi? I was born in Hong Kong. Go away before the dogs bite you. My friend, go back to India. Sucker. Boys! Boys! Boys! Give me the incense stick. That Indian fell for it. Knife, he's not the Indian. -Go and have a look! -Okay. Hey, wait! Hey, wait! Knife, he's bleeding profusely. -Send him to the hospital. -Are you insane? We set the trap. -We'll be in big trouble. -Hey. -Are you insane? You set the trap. -I set the trap? -That's right! -How is he? -He's bleeding. -Send him to the hospital! -Are you insane? We both set the trap. -Are you insane? We both set the trap. Back off! Hold him, I'll call someone out. Grandma, open up! I am having a shower, wait! I can't hold him up any longer! I can't! Don't give up. My hands are tired. Knife, there's so much money. Give them to me. -Will this do, Grandma? -Of course. I did this every time Knife hit his head when he was little. He grew up just fine. Half of the ash is for external use. The other half, internal. Trust me. I'll mix it with water in the kitchen. -We're rich. -Hey! -Half for you and half for me. -We're rich. -Don't steal his money. -Hey! It's none of her business. -Let's see what's inside. -No identity card. A lot of people in Hong Kong don't have identity cards. If he doesn't have an identity card, how can we inform his family? I'll put it in the paper. Leave his money alone, jerk. Knife, what do we do with him? We'll just have to let him stay here for the night. No! -No! -Just once! No! Come on. -Let me make a mark on your chest. -No! No. I want to wear low-cut shirts. What? Whoever buys you a low-cut, I will burn his shop. Just one! No! Is someone messing with Grandma? Let's go down. You bastard, what are you doing with my grandma? What's wrong with you? -Don't beat him. -Stop pretending. I think the injury damaged his brain. What is your name? Where do you live? Who do you work for? Tell me! Tell me! Damn it! Tell me! Bullshit! Who are you? Tell me! Tell me now, or I'll beat you up. I think he has really gone insane. He's not. He's fooling us. Beat him up and he will talk. Don't beat him. -Go to hell! -Stop beating him! -Stop beating him! -Knife, don't beat him! -Don't stop me. He deserves it. -Don't! -He deserves it. Stop fooling me. -Don't! Don't be afraid. Tell me your name. -Tell me. -Tell us! -Stop beating him! -Stop fooling me. -Did you hear me? -He deserves it. My goodness. I remember something similar -that happened on a show. -What happened? The guy got pushed down a hill, hit his head and became like this. Could it be memory loss? Come on, be real. If memory loss was so common, Big Mouth should have it and forget about my debt. No, Knife. There are short-term and partial memory loss. Well, how do you know? I studied nursing for a year. Don't you remember? If not because of you, I'd be a nurse now. Really? -Good, I'll have his money. -No, you can't. Hey! I've put your things in this bag. Put it in your pocket. Don't let anyone take it. Tell me where you live. Tell me so I can contact your family. Where are my chocolates? These? Thanks! He's like a kid. Like he came out of a mental hospital. Let's call him Mental. No, that's an ugly name. What then? How about Chocolate? As you like. Harder! -Higher! -Hey. What's wrong with you? He should not be washing others' back! Did you shout at me? You don't like it? -I'll do it then. -No! I can't have you washing others' back. -Then shut up. -I'm sorry. -I'm going to eat. -Let's eat. -Dinner? -That's a big bowl. -No more rice? -No, Chocolate ate it all. -Chocolate ate it all? -Yes. -I'll have this one. -No, it's mine. Hey! No more rice? No. -What about me? -He has a big appetite. Send him away! -No! He ate so much of our food. -He ate them all. We have to get some money from him first. Finish it, don't waste it! -Are you watching the television? -Yes. Here's a check. A 20,000-dollar check for your cash. You get more! -There are many zeroes on the check. -Of course! You have the check, and I have the cash. -Give it to me. -Give me first! Give me the money! Give it to me! Why should I? -Jane told me not to give you money. -Give it to me. Don't hit me. Jane has my back! Hey. Don't hit me! Don't, Knife! You bastard took the money! I didn't take the money! Just a hundred dollars. You're lying to me. -Believe me, I didn't! -A hundred dollars? He has over 10,000 dollars! -I only have a hundred dollars. -A hundred? -A hundred? -Don't beat me! Stop lying! Come back! Tell me you won't beat me first! -Idiots. -Come back! -He drives fast. -Knife. Don't take him with you. Big Mouth will kill him. It's all right, he has had enough practice. Tell her what you'll say. Three more sticks. No. Say, "300,000 more." Say, "300,000 more." All right, let's go. What's going on? I'll tell you once more. When you see the race on television, say, "Crap. I forgot to bet on the tips." -Bet on the tips. -Then take a check out. Ask Crow to bet on number seven of race three, understand? -Number seven, race three. -Then I'll say, "Banks are closed on Saturdays." -What will you say next? -I don't know. Come on. You say, "Crap. The jockey said it was a sure win." "Big Mouth, here's a good offer. Cash my check with 10 percent commission for the bet." Then, play cards with him. Don't do anything else. Remember? I am not sure if I can remember. Of course you can. Knife! I'm serious. Don't be so cruel to him. Nothing will happen. Big Mouth won't beat this idiot. I only want his money. The timing to call the police must be accurate. Then he can be saved. Don't worry, it's okay. Place your bet. Be quick. Big Mouth! How dare you come here? Pay me back now! No problem. I have something for you. Look. He is my cousin from the States. None of my business! He has a lot of money, but he's an idiot. He wants to get a wife from China. Why don't we cheat him of his money first? We can share the money. We'll split in 30 to 70 ratio and settle the old debt too. You decide, come! -Big Mouth, my cousin! -What's your name? Chocolate! He is a funny man. His last name is Cho. Tell me what you want to play. Baccarat, sic bo or fantan? I like cards. -Cards? -Right. Big Mouth. Can you have someone buy me this chocolate? -No problem. Hey, buy him this chocolate! -Okay. Thanks! -Keep the change. -Thanks! You must buy the expensive one. Let's go if there are no card games. We do! Of course we have card games. Finish your game. We're closed. Closed! -A thousand each, okay? -Go on. Okay. Why is the television not on? It's not working. Not working? What should we do without it? Why do you need the television when playing cards? Nonsense. Tell them what you want to watch. Horse racing! Crap! I forgot to bet on the tips. Give me the money. I'll bet for you. -Come on. -The jockey said it's a sure win. -Really? -He told me to bet... -Bet on which one? -Which one? Ten thousand each way. -Goodness. -Number seven of race three. He said it's a sure win. A check? Banks are closed on Saturday afternoons. -Right! -What do we do? Damn it! Here's a good offer. Can you cash 90 percent of the check? No hassle, let me settle it for you. No need, just give him cash. Right? Shut up! It's none of your business! Each way, number seven of race three. No problem. Let me place the bet for you on the phone. Hello, 1237689. Code, 45699. Bet 20,000 each way on number seven of race three, thanks! Five thousand. -More! -Hey! Don't! Big Mouth, I want to pee. -Someone go with him. -Okay. That's not necessary. Then sit down and finish this game first. Do you want to raise the bet? I follow. Let me see. -Let me see. -I am playing. Calm down, the two of you. What? They're both the same! Ten thousand! I follow, and 300,000 more. -Are you insane? -No! It's none of your business! -You said so. -Yes. -Yes. -Three hundred thousand. No problem, draw the card. Crap. See? Another pair. -All your money. -What? How much? You started with 500,000 and have less than 200,000 now. -I follow. -Are you insane? Hey, shut up! Or I'll burn your hand. Card! Ma'am, the phone is not working. It has been out a few days. -Nine! -Nine! -Nine! -Nine! What are you shouting for? Nine... You have no money anyway. I'll let you see the whole lot. Nine, three, and a pair? Show me yours. Ace, Jack, and a pair? So what? Draw! Three threes! -Three threes for me. -Three threes! -Three threes! -Well done! -Three threes! -We will get rich. -You bastard. You tricked me. -Big Mouth, be serious. It's a gamble after all. You had all the advantage. When can you pay us the 500,000 dollars? We didn't gamble with Hong Kong dollars. We use New Taiwan dollars here. New Taiwan dollars? Right, that'll be 150,000 Hong Kong dollars. Okay, 150,000 dollars! Here. You can have your check back. Turn the light away! I still owe you 130,000 dollars! Minus the interest of 40,000 dollars, I still owe you 80,000! We'll play another game. We draw randomly and see who is bigger. What? Shut up. I draw first! Ace of hearts! -Your turn! -Draw. Draw. Okay. -What is it? -What is it? Let me see. Gosh! -What is it? -I'm lucky. It's a little bit bigger! Two of spades. I win! You lost. -Give me the money. -You lost. Isn't the two of spades the biggest? -Don't touch my head! -You're insane! He's bullying me. Who told you to draw? We lost more than 100,000 dollars. -Are you insane? -Stop pushing! -It hurts my neck! -Stop it. Hey, tell me the truth. How did it become a three? Master said so! The phone here is broken. -I couldn't find any phone booths. -Forget it. -Let's go. -Stop! Hey! Hey! We didn't win. -Why can't we go? -Get lost! It's none of your business! Get lost! Well done. -You won the bet on the race. -What? Number seven of race three won. The payout is 92,000 dollars. But... I will take 32,000 dollars as service charge. -This 60,000 dollars is yours! -Just give it to me. -I am rich! -Rich! -Look. -I'm rich! I am very fair, right? -I know! -Well done! -Thanks! -I am rich! -Let's have an equal share. -Give it to me! Show us again. How did you do it? Tell us. Show us again! Show me! Open up! How come? I win again! I'm scared! It's great. -What is it? -It's great. We'll be rich. -Rich? What do you mean? -Yes! We've found a gambling talent. We will definitely be rich! Right. We'll take him to raid the gambling dens tomorrow. -What do you think? -Great! Take it easy. Hello? Mom. We're not ready. Give me some time. I know. Tomorrow? I'm not sure. He's busy. Hello? -Aim! -Where's your boss? He's looking for a new location. He isn't coming back tonight. -Aim! -What a jerk. -Why? -Hey! Stop that! What? My parents want to meet Knife tomorrow. We're doomed. Too bad Knife doesn't have a pager. Chocolate, can you do me a favor? I can't... say no to you. Do you remember what to say? -Of course! -Stop eating. Let me ask you. What do you do? I do... -Plastic. -Plastic... Plastic molding! When will we get married? I am still working on my career. After I have succeeded. -Do you want a bun? -No, thanks. It's all yours. I gave you Crow's pager. What if it beeps? My supervisor is paging me. I'll visit you during Lunar New Year. Behave, all right? I will! Where is my chocolate? I'll buy you ten boxes later. Jane! Mom, Dad. -This is Knife. -Sir, ma'am. He likes to play around. He's quite handsome. Knife, where do you work? -Work? Hey, roast pork bun! -Roast pork bun! Roast pork buns are good here! -Where do you work? -Work... What do you do? Plastic... Plastic molding. Cleaning. No. I clean the streets and take care of shit. -Clean the streets and take care of shit. -The cleaning business is a promising business, right? Am I clever? Youngsters nowadays are not willing to do that kind of business. Hey, let's be frank. You and Jane have been together for a long time. We are very open. Still, the relatives have to know. Sure! Let them know I have many colorful plastic bags at home. I put one on every time I take a shower. Honey, it's better like this. At least, he won't cause trouble. When will you get married? Soon! But we still have to wait until I get promoted. Then we will get married. Do you get promoted as a cleaner? -Honey, take it easy! -I can't control myself. -Will he be promoted to manager of shit? -Do you want buns? My supervisor paged me. Enjoy the meal. I have to go. Return the call, go. I want to... -Return the call! -What do you want? I'll pray for you on Lunar New Year. I remember now. -What did you say? -Dad! Stop! -He's your father-in-law. -What father-in-law? Knife, he is my dad. -Nice to meet you. -Who are you? Her boyfriend. And him? Me? -When he's not around, -He... I am her boyfriend! -Why are you such a mess? -No, Mom! I... He... There's no need to explain! One cleans shit. The other one threatened me. There will be a third one to chop me up! Let's go! -Rice rolls! -Bye! Let's drink! -No, thanks. -Rice rolls? -No. -You don't want any? But I do! What are you doing? Why are we going to a loan shark? We spent all the money. How can we bet? Don't worry. We can surely win later. Come on! I'm not going. I'll have ice cream with Chocolate! Let's go. -We'll go ahead. -Let's go. Sure Win Finance Company. Knife, your credit is bad. How can I lend you money? Mr. Shing, it's different now. I have changed. If I'm not sure that I can pay you back, I won't borrow any money from you. Shit! Will I believe you and lend you 80,000 dollars just like that? Do you take me for an idiot? You said you'd get rich. How can I trust you? This is classified. Well, keep your secret. Mr. Shing, wait. Trust me. Look at this. Look at my gear. We want to borrow from you so that we can win big. Do you mean it's a sure win? Not really! But it's possible. My dad taught me to be humble. Even if it's a sure win, I can only say, "It's possible." Good, I like helping young people. Kwong, give him 72,000 dollars. What 72,000 dollars? It's 80,000! Are you new? The interest is excluded! Isn't that right, Mr. Shing? Don't do that. It's disgusting. -Hey! -How did it go? It's all right! Go home and ask Grandma to prepare dinner. -I'll go and get my pay. Go. -You're always like this. The chocolates are all gone. -Wait until the game is over. -I want chocolates. Crow, go and buy some, then join me at the den, understand? Wait! -Buy my favorite one. -Of course. Make it quick! -Come on! -Excuse me! Knife, see you later. Why the long face? Did your dad die? I want chocolates. He won't be long. Play some games first. What's the matter with you? Don't upset me or I'll beat you. Move! -The mental King of Gamblers! -Sit! -The mental King of Gamblers! -He's the King of Gamblers. -What should we bet on? -You decide. Let's see. Not a bad game. Hey, make a good bet. I want chocolates. -What? -I want chocolates. Shut up or I'll beat you up! Follow his bet! You'll win! -Are you looking for your boss? -Yes. Come in. -What about this game? -Chocolates are here! Your chocolates. Thanks, Crow! What about this game? Do we bet on the banker? -Right. -Where is my favorite chocolate? -Didn't you get his favorite one? -It was sold out. They said I'd have to go to Central. Hey, it's a good game. -Place your bet first. -I want my favorite one! All right, but place your bet first. Hands clear! An eight. Banker wins! Bastard! Do you know we lost more than 70,000 dollars? Go. Go and get it! Place another bet. It's all right. Let's wait until Crow comes back. I'm going to the toilet. Stay here, okay? Good boy. Place your bets. Place your bets. Quick. Place your bets. Hey! Why do you have so many cigarettes? The banker gave them to me! Thanks. What's good? -I've bet them all. -Good! Where's the money? Over there! He lost all the money. -Do you want a smoke? -Place your bets. What did I tell you? I told you to stay and not to bet. I did it on purpose. You hit me. Go to hell! -Where are you taking me? -Come with me! -Wait for me here! I won't be long. -Where are you going? -I have to pee! -Again? It's none of your business! -Wait here! -Okay. -Be quick. -All right! Thanks! You bad boy! You dropped them all on the floor! You're useless! Stop crying! Shut up! Shut up! I'll smack you! Useless! I'll get rid of you! -No! -I don't know you! Go away! You dropped them all! Stop crying! Shut up! -I'll smack you! -Enough! Chocolate! Chocolate! Chocolate! Chocolate! Chocolate! Where did you go? I went to buy Mickey Mouse balloons. I told you to stay. -I'll smack you! -No! Come over. Come over! I told you to stay. You never listen! I don't want to look for you. You shouldn't have peed. I was so scared after you left me alone! Chocolate, I promise you. I won't leave you alone again. -I know you won't. -It hurts. Idiot, have a Mickey Mouse balloon! -You look like an idiot! -You're the idiot! Take it easy, doctor. I suspect it's partial memory loss. Memory loss? There was trauma to his skull. The blood clot in the brain affected his nerves. That's why his memory is partially lost. He's like a ten-year-old mentally. Can he be cured? It's hard to say for sure. But if I remove the blood clot with surgery, -he'll be a lot better. -Do you want one? Are you his family? He's my cousin. This operation is complicated. -It's expensive. -It will cost 200,000 dollars. He lost all the money. Where do we get the money? I've thought about it. We'll sell everything, including the car. And the piece of land we have if we have to. What about our debt with Shing? We'll have to pay him later. What if they come and ask for it? We won't wait for them. We'll move to Kowloon tomorrow. A friend of mine has a villa. We'll stay there for now. A villa? ECSTATIC VILLA Insane! Stop it! Let's go! Ma'am, the rooms are the same. There is a round bed! It's such a big one! I can sleep any way I want! Stop playing around. Have a rest. I'll go and get some food and beer. Sorry to trouble you. That's all right! It won't hurt for those perverts to have less sex. I'm going. Okay, I'll set it up properly. -Knife. -Yes? Why does the chocolate look like this? -It's a balloon. -A balloon? Hey! Hush! Keep quiet! Why should I be quiet when they're screaming? It's the rule here. Men should keep quiet or they'll chop it off. -Chop it off? -Yes! What will I do without it? Put it away. What's the matter? Don't be so loud. -Isn't it a room check? -It's the rule. Only women are allowed to yell here. Or they'll cut it off! -You're insane! -I'm insane? -I'll cut yours off. -What are you doing? Help! Don't mess around! I only have one! Are you crazy? -Help! He's crazy! -Come out! -I'll cut it off! -Sorry. What are you doing? -He was screaming! -That's nothing to do with you! Be smart! You told me no screaming or they'll cut it off. Hey. Hey. Here, have a piece of chocolate. No. There are two. No. Is three enough? Come on. Say sorry. Come on. I'll cut yours off! Bastard! THE IDIOT It's your turn. Hey, I have to go to the toilet. Be back soon. Damn it! Why did I go through with it? That girl gave me this! Why didn't she tell me she had a disease? Knife! Mr. Shing, are you peeing? I'll leave. How dare you fight back? -What's wrong, sir? -What's wrong? -Chase after him! -Yes, sir! Stay there, kid! Don't play! You can't get away! Jump if you want to get away! Damn you! Go to hell! Stop! Don't come up! You can't get away! Shit! -Kill him! -Throw at him! Go to hell! -You go and catch him! -You go! Jump over! You fool! Damn you! Jump over or he'll get away! Hurry! Come on! Superman! -Jump over! -Down there! -Don't run! -Catch him! Jump over! -Over there! -Stop! I'll kill you when I catch you. Damn you!

Come and catch me! -Get over there! You can't get away! -Go! -Come and catch me! You can't get away! Damn you! -Come over! Don't be scared! -You bastard! -Wait until we catch you! -Come over! Hey! I am here for you. Come and catch me! -Bastard! Are you playing tricks? -Wait until I catch you. Quick, get over there! He'll fall to his death. -Hit him! -I'll kill you! Make him fall! He'll fall to his death. Sir. -Bastard! -What's the matter? Please let me go back. -Go to hell! -He'll be dead! He'll be dead! Are you looking for me? You are here at last, bastard! Where are we going? So? It's taken care of. You've been to several nightclubs. And you just came out of The Tonnochy. How can you start working at so many places tomorrow? I don't care. We have to safe Knife first. Let's go! No more chocolates. 38, 962, 963, 896, 296. Hello. Hello? Hello. Is it Ko Chun? Hello. Is it Ko Chun? This is Ecstatic Villa. Who are you looking for? Ko Chun. Hello? Don't play with the phone. -Hello. -Hello. Mr. Shing, please. -That's me. Who is speaking? -I am Knife's girlfriend. So you call at last. Knife wouldn't have to suffer if you called earlier. Please release him. -I'll pay you half of the money tonight. -What? You can't do that. It's 210,000 dollars altogether. -What? 210,000 dollars? Mr. Shing! -Look. He'll lose his hand if the debt isn't paid tomorrow. That's all. Mr. Shing! How is it? He said I have to pay him 210,000 dollars. Where do I get the remaining 130,000? What about the money for his surgery? More than half is gone. The operation is tomorrow. We have paid the deposit. I don't know where the rest of the money is. What do we do? I don't know. Only the God of Gamblers can save us. Come in. Mr. Shing, Knife's girlfriend is here. -Mr. Shing. -Not bad! Don't follow Knife. You should join me. I've brought 80,000 dollars. Please let Knife go. That's not even enough for the interest! Mr. Shing, please do it for me. Who the hell do you think you are? Why should I do anything for you? Not for me, but for the God of Gamblers! The God of Gamblers? We're only making a living. Let's respect each other. Release Knife and you'll have a new friend. Is he the real God of Gamblers, Mr. Shing? Of course not! Girl, don't fool me! Know who you're dealing with. You have guts. Are you really the God of Gamblers? Yes, I am. I bet one million on it. Good! The God of Gamblers! Show me proof. I am the God of Gamblers! -Shuffle the deck. -What deck? Give me one to King in sequence. -Let me do it! -Stay away! You do it! Hey, have it. God of Gamblers, you gave me a pure Dragon? That's mine, this is yours. Hey, how did you do it? I don't know. You still owe me seven chocolates! Mr. Shing, here's 80,000 dollars. Check for yourself. Did I say I'd take it? Hey, let Knife go! -Let Knife go! -You are the God of Gamblers? I don't believe you. I am the God of Gamblers! Freeze! Damn it! Stay away! Stay away! You bastards! Release Knife! He's not here! -He's not here? -He's here! You bastards! Bring him out! -Okay. -Okay. -Go! -Don't move! -Knife! -Knife! -Knife, are you all right? -I'm fine. Knife! You bastard! Knife! Tell me, is it fair? I am a bastard! Is it fair? You're putting a knife on my neck. Of course I have to say it's fair. You are smart. Tell them to lie down over there! Lie down! -Quick! -Bastards! Shut up! Lie down! Knife, please go! -Stand up! -I need to call the ambulance! -Stand up! Go out! -Knife. Please be careful, Knife! Be careful! Be careful of your knife. -Knife. -Let's go! -Please, Knife! -Bastard! Damn you! I am a bastard! -Mr. Shing! -Mr. Shing! Shut up and call the ambulance! Call the ambulance. It has been 11 days. Still no news about Ko Chun. If he doesn't come back tomorrow, I'll call the police. Actually, I suspect Ko Yee's loyalty. Especially recently. He has been kind of strange these past few days. What are you doing? I had a drink. I want to sleep. Please leave. I only want to accompany you, so you won't get bored. What are you doing? Get out! Come on! Ko Chun has been gone for days. Don't you want to get some? Get out or I will tell Ko Chun. Ko Chun... So what? What about me? I am smart too. Why is Ko Chun the God of Gamblers while I am of no importance? Let go of me! Listen to me! I'll treat you better than Ko Chun. Say yes to me. I promise you that I won't be like Ko Chun who cares more about playing cards than you. I will take care of you. How will you answer to Ko Chun? I've had enough of him. No one knows who Ko Yee is. They only know that I'm Ko Chun's follower. Ko Chun loves you. Why can't I love you too? I won't be anything until he's dead. No wonder you wouldn't let me call the police. He forced me to do this. He is rich, but he keeps all the money to himself. Even if he's alive, I'll put him to death. Then I'll have you and his 1,500,000 US dollars in the Swiss bank. You recorded me? Now who will know I did it? You bitch. You'd rather die than let me have you. You can't stop me. I want you even if you're dead. I know that you are Chan Kam-shing's partner in Hong Kong. Why don't we eliminate Ko Chun together? Are you interested? Ko Chun is a fool to trust a bastard like you. I am smart. It's not easy to be like me. Ko Chun has gone missing. I need his dead body as proof. I'm sure you do too. Look, I'll put two million US dollars into your account. I'm paying you to do the job. If Ko Chun is dead, you'll be happy. I'll have one less enemy for myself and for Mr. Chan. Mr. Nam, it's good for everyone. I can send someone to do it, but how will you find Ko Chun? I heard he was seen in Mongkok with a punter called Knife. Send someone to look for him. Mr. Nam, they are up there. I am Knife, who are you? My hand! Ko Chun. Don't lie to me. You're not Ko Chun! -My hand! -Are you okay? I haven't heard from you for so long. Who are you? I am Dragon, Ko Chun's friend. Who is Ko Chun? Him? He is the God of Gamblers? It has nothing to do with me! It has nothing to do with me! Who are they? Enemy. Rubbish. I know that. Why did you ask then? Is there a back door here? There's one over there to the mall. Give me a gun. -Do you know how to use it? -I guess. You said you knew. -I know how to hold it. -Be careful with the recoil. -Hold it with both hands. -Okay. Be careful! I can do it. I don't need your help. Master! Master! I'm fine. Unbelievable. -Knife, how are you still fine? -Let's go! -Where's Ko Chun? -He went that way with Knife. -Hide! -Okay. -Stop! -This way! -Get down! -Master, let me handle it! Master, let's go! Master, come over! Stop! Master, don't worry. I'll handle it. Where is Master? -Don't shoot! -Ko Chun! Don't get any closer. You've been gone for so long. Where have you been? I don't know you! Stay away! Ko Chun, stop playing. I'm here to save you. Let's go back. There are many men with guns. Ko Chun, are you all right? I'm scared! I am Ko Yee. Don't you remember me? There are many men with guns. I'm scared! Ko Chun. I don't care if you're insane for real or not. You are a dead man now. Master, get away from here! Hey! Ko Chun! Pick up the gun! Come out! Come out! Come out! Be careful! Ko Chun! -He's bleeding. -Yes. Stand clear. What's the matter? Are you all right? Do you need to go to the hospital? Stop! He is so unlucky. How many casualties were there in the mall? -How many are dead? -Does it involve Vietnamese people? Was the God of Gamblers involved in a gang fight? No comment. -No comment. -Sorry, no comment. No comment. No comment. Sorry. -Is the God of Gamblers up there? -I am not sure. Sorry, no comment. Ko Chun, I am Ko Yee! Do you recognize me? I am Ko Yee! I am Ko Yee! Ko Yee? It's good that you are okay. I thought I'd never see you again. Ko Yee. What happened? Don't you know? I only remember... After I got off the train that night, I walked along a path. I fell down the hill suddenly. I can't remember anything after that. Why am I here? I've reported it to the police. You were knocked down by a car. The police contacted me. Where is Janet? Where is she? Is she okay? Ko Chun. I am sorry. Ko Yee. Tell me what happened. Ten days after you went missing, I went looking for you. Janet was all alone at Crocodile's villa. One day, when I went back there, I saw broken glass all over the balcony. There was blood on the floor. And Janet was gone. Why did this happen? Ko Chun, hit me. Ko Chun. I am useless! I couldn't protect her. Hit me! Ko Chun, hit me. Excuse me! There are so many people. Are they bargaining? No, they are reporters! No! I said do it! Go! -Go! -Okay. Harassment! Someone harassed me! -Ko Chun, where do you want to go? -I have to go! -I have to find Janet! -Ko Chun, calm down! You're not going anywhere. Chocolate! You bastard! Stop fighting! You helped my enemy! Ko Yee! -Who is he? -Who am I? You stayed at my place for so long! I kept you for months! Now you don't know me? -What are you talking about? -What? -Ignore him. He's insane! -What's wrong? -I'm insane? -He's insane! -Officer, get him out! -I'm insane? Let me go! -Come! -Don't trust him! He's not on your side! Don't trust him! Let me go! Ko Chun, I'll take care of it. The police will take care of it. Make some calls for me to look for Janet. All right. Hey! You're the police, so what? I'm a taxpayer! Respect me like you respect your dad! Knife, you've never paid tax. Are you kidding? No time for jokes! You suck! Do you know that he teamed up with someone against me? He said he didn't know me and he wanted to arrest me! Knife, are you crying? Who said so? Did you see me cry? That's because of the sand in my eye. Hey, what do we do now? Don't ask me! What do we do? Watch it! I'll be back! I'm telling you! Let's see who the loser is! Be careful, Knife! Leave me alone! I'm fine! I want to prove that he will lose. Let's go! This one? Not this one, another one. Stop eating chocolates. It's fattening. -Hello. -Ko Chun? -Yes. -It's good to know you're back. I rang as soon as I heard about you. I have something important to tell you. What is it? You bastard! My men died because of you. How dare you come here! Mr. Nam, listen to me. I know a way to make money. What about the two million US dollars? I'll pay you after you have handled Ko Chun. You have plenty of chances. Why do you need my help? I don't want him dead yet. You fooled me? Nam! -Stop. -Mr. Chan. Why do you want Ko Chun alive? You are smart, Mr. Chan. You know what I'm thinking. The bet between you and Ko Chun is hot stuff to other punters all over Asia. They bet three to one that Ko Chun will win. Cut the crap. If I can make him lose to you, isn't that a way to make money? How can you make sure I win? Stop. I thought the God of Gamblers was perfect. He is inexperienced after all. Mr. Chan. We have watched tapes of Ko Chun in casinos. There is nothing wrong with his games. I have watched his 500 card games. I noticed that he has a minor habit. He may not know it himself. If Ko Yee didn't tell me his last card, I wouldn't have noticed. What is it? When he plays the trick, he would touch his jade ring. Mr. Chan, leave it to me. Ace, King, Queen and Jack. What can you see now? Nothing. I see no shadow nor code. Here, look with my glasses. There's a dot on Ace, two dots on King, three dots on Queen, and a line on Jack. This chemical can only be seen with a pair of liquid crystal glasses. The glass contains cyanide. It is only produced in the States. I have ordered one pair. It looks the same as normal glasses. It costs 10,000 US dollars. But it won't work. There will be someone to inspect the cards. And if they use the same glasses, they will find out. You are right. For a big game like this, both parties will have someone to inspect the cards. Mr. Chan, who will do the inspection for you? -Me! -Right. Ko Chun will ask me to do it. If no one says anything, who will know about the trick? He is not really a god! Uncle Hing! I'm sorry. -Ko Chun, you are late! -Yes. Let's go! Have a drink first. We'll sail into international waters. Sorry. I only drink with my friends. What? See you later. Uncle Hing, I want to go to the toilet. Show him. Please. Hey! What do you want? I promised not to leave you alone. I will only say that once. Your cousin wanted to shoot you at the carpark. Ko Yee. He said you wanted to kill me. Is that true? Me? I know you want to talk to me. Wait until I finish the game. Then we can talk. Ko Yee, bring him in. Remember to keep quiet. Okay. Mutual inspection of cards. Inspection completed. We can start. The base card is Ace. Twenty thousand! Fifty thousand. Mr. Chan, you're so careful. It's better to be careful. I want to have the money to celebrate my 70th birthday next year. Pair of sevens to call. Two million. Good price! There are no Hearts. But I have nine cards, so a flush is still possible. Two million for me too. How lucky! If it was the other way around, I wouldn't have been so lucky. It's two million after the fourth card. The fifth should not be less than five million. Right? Straight flush, five million. What a tricky one! I have two pairs of Queens and sevens. I should not be threatened. Five million for me too. Show your hand. Master... It's like you're able to read my cards. Young man, you are still too green. Freeze! Ko Chun, it's the last box. Ace to call. Two hundred thousand. No problem. Pair of Aces to call. I have a pair of Aces. Two million. I will follow. My call again? Looks like I'll get back my last loss. Four million. I don't think you have that much cash. I have a Swiss bank draft. It's worth 30 million dollars. We don't trust you. Have an expert check it. Mr. Ko Chun. There's no need to use your own money. It's not only for you. Mr. Chan. Get someone to check it. Your name alone is worth more than 30 million dollars. I believe you. I follow! I have luck today. You're not the only one. Ko Chun, we're winning it back. Let's look at the last card. It's a King! How rare is that? Three Aces versus three Queens! What a coincidence! Let's not waste time. A total of 26 million. A total of 26 million? Ko Chun, you are very pushy! The young ones are young after all. You're impatient. Okay, I'll put in 26 million too. I have four Queens! Show me your hand! I'm impressed. No wonder they call you the King of Gamblers. You have four Queens. But it's not your lucky day today. You have lost. Mr. Chan, you are far behind. Your pair of liquid crystal glasses was made two years ago. And this pair of liquid crystal contact lens that I have is the latest technology from Germany! It costs 110,000 US dollars. I put the two dots on this Ace. And... My habit of touching the ring is a trap that I set up in the last 500 games to trick you, old fox. Ko Yee. I have to thank you. I couldn't have defeated him without you. He thought someone else paid him the two million dollars. You betrayed me? Ko Yee! You bastard! You son of a bitch! You're dead! Don't shoot! Freeze! Freeze! I'm on your side. Don't move! Don't move. Don't move, please. You thought you burned the tape. Ko Chun, what do you want? Nothing. Everyone saw you shoot him. What are you laughing about? It was self-defense. Everyone knows it's a toy gun. Your plan has a little loophole. We're in international waters. You can't do anything. Only the registered nation can arrest me. Is that right, Uncle Hing? My ship is registered in Panama. The Panama president and I are friends. That doesn't mean anything. Look out the window. See if you can see Lantau Island. Sorry, Uncle Hing. My men forced the captain not to go into international waters. It's all right. You could have told me earlier. Ko Chun, how is this good for you? You broke the law too! It's fine. I'll only be fined 3,000 dollars for gambling. But you... will serve at least 30 years for murder. I'm afraid you'll have to celebrate your 70th birthday in prison. Don't invite me. I won't go. Mr. Ko Chun. Thank you for helping me avenge my father. That's all right. As I said, it wasn't only for you. I did it for myself as well. How can I repay you? Buy me a nice box of chocolates. I haven't seen you smile before. Can you smile once for me? No, I look ugly if I smile. God of Gamblers! Bye! God... He doesn't remember me. Crow! Jane! Hey! Calm down. -You... -I'm Chocolate! You recognize me. Why didn't you acknowledge me? Then I wouldn't have been able to fool them. So you fooled me. You're dumb. I tried to tell you. Your IQ is so low. How can you be my partner in Las Vegas? Why should I... What did you say? Las Vegas! Las Vegas? It's a good offer. -A 30 to 70 ratio. -No. What if you don't recognize me again? I will! If you don't recognize me, -I'll cut it off! -I'll cut it off! Subtitle translation by Juno Mak
