ELEMENTARY SCHOOL Participating in the film's final scene are school teachers who've received the "Educational Merit Award" in the 1st year of its inception in Milan. Direct from Rome? - Track 6. - Thanks. Hey Pilade! - The twins! Welcome back! Hello, Ma'am. Leaving, Pilade? - No, I'm looking for a friend. Vacation is over eh? - Yeah. - See you at school. I entrust them to you. - I'm just an usher, Ma'am. We have the same teacher? - Who knows, dear? Here's the train. Bye! Goodbye, Ma'am! Porter! - Professor! Pilade! - Here I am. Give me the bags. Anymore? - No, I'll carry the small one. Porter! Porter! Give it to me. - OK. Pilade! - How are you, Sir? Not bad, and you? - I get by - We all do, dear! So much iron! - We're in Milan. What's the saying? "Milan is too Milan". Come on. Let's call a porter. - A porter? No. - Yes. I can't allow you... - I'll allow myself. Come! Thanks. Don't worry you're with your countrymen. A lot of people, eh? The return from holiday Milan! By the way... I'd thought you'd went on vacation. I preferred to stay in Milan. - Affairs of the heart? At our years? Don't mention ages. I'm 20. - Lucky you. Are you staying long? - Where? - In Milan. I won an essay contest. I was transferred. They want me as a teacher No! - Off me! Be careful! I'm very sorry. Couldn't you have written me? - I wanted to surprise you. Let's go. Say do you have plans to work at another school? Not at all. - How will you manage? - With my job. You in our village, with your salary lived like a lord. You need more here! What about you, then? - I'm an usher, not a teacher I get by. - How? By moonlighting, a few sales, tips... Let's go, OK? - No, I must tell you, you're acting crazy Listen to me and go back to Palestrina. - Still the wiseguy! I'm a wiseguy who knows about starving! Eh, what the heck! This is it. We've arrived. Good day Mr. Mucci. - Good day I'll go ahead to clear the way - By all means. This is my house. The kitchen is that way And this, my room. A few sales pays, eh? - I wish. I inherited it, the floor is mine. Oh, I get it! - My Aunt Carolina left it to me. She loved me like a son. She was a single Mucci like me. Everything you see was hers. Good things, with taste. Thanks. Before she went, three years before she died in a bombardment, she told me, "Pilade, it'll be all yours." "This apartment which cost us so much toil, you must live here." "Nobody else." - Nice, Pilade. A coffee? - Definitely I'm so nervous and as much as I smoke, I've a sore throat. Look at this lovely ashtray I won it at a fishing contest for charity Why don't we cool off a bit? - I wish. I also have a bathtub, you know? Shall we hang our clothes there? Yes. This way. - May I get a drink of water? Of course, go to the kitchen. No! A moment! There's a trick to it. There we go. You see? It's just a noise, don't worry Go in. Bur jacket. I have no words to thank you for your hospitality But we're old schoolmates, that goes without saying. I don't want to take advantage. - OK, but in the meantime, you can sleep here. Tomorrow, we'll see what we can do. It won't be easy Why aren't there any rooms? - No, it's the prices that are too high. Why did you accept the job? I was choking. My mother has always considered me a child. Always over me. The divine selfishness of mothers. After her death, I realized that I was living life in a perpetual childhood. Now I want to live, dear Pilade, and fight. I have ambitions! You know what Carducci says? - What? - "Life is beautiful, the future sacred". The future! What's the rush? At our age, a few years'll sort it out. At our age! I'm only 20. - Ah, I get it! What? - That you lost your mind. I'd like to be the Education Minister for five minutes! - To do what? Send you right back to Palestrina. FIRST DAY OF CLASS Let's go! Get in! Keep order in the yard! Come on! Lady give me the crying child. No problem, see. Come on! Let's go. But be good! Be good! Come on! What are you doing? What a face! You mustn't cry! Shame! Smile! What's your name? - Gianfranco. And you? - Vittorio. Now you're friends. Go to school. Go on! Morning, Sir! - Hi, Pilade! - Morning, Ma'am! Here's our student. - That never studies! I leave him in your hands. - Don't worry Ma'am. Can I see you today? - OK. Good morning, Ma'am. - Morning. Quiet! One at a time! This way! Let the teacher pass! Let him pass. Good morning, Sir Come on, you can do it! Ah, you're there too? Repeating a class... Do you know Milan? - Oh, God... I was here a few times, during the war A big city to outsiders. If you need anything, just ask. Good luck. - Thanks a lot. Careful, this class is a bit... - Thanks. Sit. You clean the blackboard. Gimme a piece of paper. - No. Now then... The holidays are oven Are you happy to be back in school? Honestly? Not me, Sir - Good, I like sincerity What's your name? - Alessandro Bonfanti, son of Alberto, industrialist. And you, in the back? Sir! He's Crippa, repeating. Ernesto Crippa, right? "PARENT: None." And you - Brambilla. Ah! The well known Brambilla family who naturally went on vacation. Sit. Today you left home to start a new life, right? You become part of another great family, right? Right! - Pilade? - Eh? - You got a knife? Of course, a Japanese one. Look how smooth they made it. Does it cut? - It's Japanese! It'll be difficult to tell you apart: you're both the same! A minute. Looking for somebody? No, no, sorry. Good. We'll do this: you, Renato, go on the left, and you, Roberto, you go on the right. Got it? But I'm Renato. Fine, you go on the left. Quick, get out your notebooks! 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a balcony No. 3 service lifts. No. One room with two beds. There's a single bed! - I'm looking for a small room. Just a little room? I wish. - I get it, let's see. "Room for rent..." "30,000 lire for who finds a lost Maltese, named Fofó." What's a Maltese? - Please! - May I... 30,000 lire! Excuse me. - Thanks. "Small furnished, quiet room. Serious people only 30,000." What's left is a bed in a hall. 6,000. Is my place so bad then? - I don't want to take advantage. Take advantage! - Hey who's renting here, you or me? You... - Well then! I pay taxes... - Excuse me, we'll be back. You must check it out first before you accept the price. Understand? The very last Lombard! What a madhouse! - That's putting it mildly Did you know I published a book in Milan? Bravo! - It was nothing, but the editor liked it. He congratulated me by mail. - Mondadori? Rizzoli?? No, Foschini. For what I'm writing now, I'd like a showcase just like this. You're writing a book? - You know what it's called? No. - "Children Do Not Exist." And who comes to class then? - They're men. Small, but men. Do you understand? - Let's go see Milan. Machines! - Industry trade, business. Have you chosen? I'll take this. - Alright, Miss. Would you like it wrapped? - No, thanks. May I help you? - 5 Nationals. 5 for me too. - There you go. Good evening, Ma'am. - Evening. Herein Milan, the car is a must. But someday I'll have one. For my job as an usher is only temporary I say Professor here they don't know who I am yet. But someday they will. Perhaps. Milan sure is different. There's something electric in the air! A coffee? - Even better some chamomile. Do me this favor seeing that your class is having a checkup. - Of course. Attention! A few minutes. The substitute has already been called. Yes, Sir Don't worry. At ease! Dear children, here we are. You seem good, behaved. Is it because you're afraid of me? No! - Am I a scary person? No! School is not as bad as you thought. But you were afraid of school, but now; you no longer are. Yes. - Yes. - I was never afraid. It shows. Well, we'll see. Who can tell me the name of a quadruped you all know? Let's hear it. - Di... dinosaur Ah! You know him well? Yes, Sir. I saw it at the movies. There was also a brontosaurus. I mean the name of a smaller animal that you see everyday You tell me. - A puma. Puma! There we go: a puma! Attention! - Go ahead, Miss. At ease. I present to you one of our best teachers. Mr. Trilli, Miss Bramati. - Pleasure. Children, here's your new teacher Please, make your school proud. What were they like? - A little high spirited... I'll leave you to your work. Your first time? Yes. - You'll do a great job. Good luck. - Thanks. Say "Attention". - Attention! At ease. Let's start with introductions. Very nice! We even have police! Silence! Who told you to do that? The truth is that I... Yes, but discipline must come from within. Thanks, Pilade. You may go. Erase that, I don't even want to see it! Aren't you ashamed to be smoking at your age! Idiot! In school, too! Out of this class! Don't be afraid, I won't hit you. Walk! Go on! What is it? You stop that! And you Colonnetti, want to say something? Stand up! What did you say? You're all dumb, eh? Fine. Sit down! Go behind the blackboard! Go to your seat. Now, let's see. Yesterday we talked about municipalities, right? You, Roberto Locatelli. Yes, you! What year was the Battle of Legnano? If you're on the right, then you're Roberto. Answer like you did yesterday! Don't you know? If I gave you an eight yesterday it means I was wrong. Then I'll give the eight to Renato and a zero to Roberto. Is something wrong? What is it? Sir, Roberto is my brother I'm Renato. Very nice! You changed your places! Zero for both, and at recess you switch back. Sit down. Boys don't make me switch methods. You want me to police you, punish you? Nice way to educate: obey out of fear! No, you must be afraid of doing wrong, not punishment. I'm not here to be a tyrant, but to teach you how to govern yourselves. Because today you must elect a class president, because each class has one who deserves it. I want to see whom you choose. Get up, leave in silence, two by two. You... You come out. Do you realize what you've done? If you act like that it means you have no respect for me or your classmates. You have any complaints against your schoolmates? Tell your mother I want to talk to her She can't. She works all day And is there anyone at home that could...? Look, you ought to be more honest with me. I don't know... you always seem so introverted, alone. Your schoolmates play with each other. You don't speak to anyone. - Can I go, Sir? Yes, go. Four at a time. - Vote for me and I'll give you a cookie. What, campaigning? I'd like to see inside this child. He always sees school as a punishment. He's closed, not open to anything. In a way it's good to see so much pride in a child. Pride is not a solution. - But it's a defense. I don't think you can approach children with such ideas, Miss. Perhaps, I'm not cut out for this work. On the other hand, I must live. Well, they say Milan offers better things... Yes, I know But I have a diploma. Don't you think I'm capable of teaching reading? It's not just about reading. A school must be more, everything. We are instrumental in shaping children. I don't know if I'm capable. I don't have much trust in myself. I know it's fashionable to be skeptical, but your smile betrays you! But there's a sure way with kids: Look at them, one by one. Children don't exist, that's our invention so, we can ignore the responsibility Later Attention! - Turn around, march! Forward, march! Attention: right! Attention: right! I cut myself with your knife! They're Japanese and not made for Italian shaving... Fine, give me the knife. - The Japanese? How much? - Don't worry we'll talk later Now then... elected class president by 15 votes: Calcaterra. I think you have chosen well. - What do I have to do, Sir? Be a good example. It may seem little, but that's what all bosses do. Go. Don't let it get to you. - I'm still in charge, all the same! Pilade! Pilade! - What is it? What, Luciano? A big boy like you! Come on! Just look at this... Is that a "super"? - No. Are you going this way? - No, that way You want to put on your coat? - No, thanks, it's hot. How's the new teacher? - He's a good guy Let's see the grades. Don't eat this, you'll get sick. I'm always telling you! Tip! Tip! Tip! Stupid! Brush! Brush! Tip! Tip! Tip! One of these days... - If you're not afraid now... Get out! - I told you to leave him alone! Don't touch me, moron! - Go home, kids! Go! I'm not afraid of you! - Let's go, if you dare! Let's go. Come on. Shame on you! If I were your father...! You've all been warned: I'm in charge of the class! We'll see! Everybody go home! Come on! Get! Mr. Mucci. 15,000 deposit. - Here you go. Mr. Mateucci. Miss Zavani. Good afternoon. The mail is ready Put a stamp on it and ask the secretary for the current accounts. Got it? I've been waiting in the lobby for two days. - He's busy Don't bother I know very well he won't see you today Mr. Oreggi. Come, Oreggi. Hello, Ma'am. - Hello, Pilade. Is my husband here? - Yes, with Oreggi. - Thanks. Look after my son. - Rest easy How's the new teacher? - Great, he's my friend. Good morning, Ma'am. Hello? Pilade. 3 million. Enter them in the account and prepare them for shipping. Alright? Thank you. Good day This is the total... - Yes. The current accounts and the registered letters. Mrs. Bonfanti just passed by So? - Pretty lady, right? - Yes. Ok. I'll try to set an appointment for noon. This package is certified. - Good. The stamps are all crooked. Hurry up and go! What if there are people? - You told him I was here? But like Oreggi: Nothing doing! Tell your boss, I'll be back tomorrow, if I haven't already sold the patent! I will. Insane! I come here bringing him a fortune and he won't see me! Hey! - I'm going. Good day Sir, excuse me. Please wait. Would you tell me about the patent? Shirt-pants. All one piece. Interchangeable. Listen, I'd like to hear more about it... Good evening. - Hello. Merry Christmas to all. - Thanks. Best wishes to you and your family Thanks. - All home tonight, eh? I have two more than last year I'm a grandma now - Congratulations. My first Christmas in Milan. Me too. We always used to spend it in the mountain. All of us together Certainly you won't be lacking for company In the mountain, it's another thing. Mondini. - Merry Christmas. What about this year? It'll be different. I'm not going anywhere. You want to say something? - Not at all, uh... yes. But later there's no rush. - Brilli! - You're being called. Excuse me. - Go ahead. If I were tell you something, Miss, what would you say? I don't know what it's about. - Oh, yeah... But I can't, it's not time. If I could, I'd go to the mountains too. To Cortina. What am I saying? I mean Switzerland! Anyway, Merry Christmas. - Thank you very much. Fortunately, Christmas brings extra pay, but it never seems enough. Do as I do: three salaries. In Italy today you need three salaries to live. Everyone knows that. - Or do like me: get out. How so? - Yesterday, I submitted my resignation. Really? - So suddenly? What are you gonna do? - Journalism. I hope to see you again, Miss. - Why are you leaving? - Yes. I'll be weekly editor: news, scandals, fashion, deaths. - Congratulations. This is what journalism has become. You must give the public what it wants. Goodbye. - Good luck to all. He's not the first to drop out. He won't be the last. - You're right. And we stay here, standing still. We strike in support of others, but when we needed them, nobody moved. People today are organized by the left and right, but we continue with our independent union. I know, our position is difficult, but... for the state of culture to be truly free, then it must be independent. - Bravo! I like to hear such words. Merry Christmas. - You too. It's all the same to me. - You're right. Merry Christmas. By the way I owe you 5,000, right? - Yes. - Here you go. - Thanks. Thanks. - Don't mention it. - I owe you 800. Thanks. Thanks. Merry Christmas. Your enthusiasm is contagious. I have yet to buy gifts! Actually, me too... - Let's go together then. With great pleasure. Goodbye, Pilade. - Goodbye, Miss. Merry Christmas. - Thanks. And... What will you be doing tonight? - Don't worry about it. Thanks. Good. The truth is that I have a date. Bye. - Merry Christmas. Pilade! Probably from Rome. Do you have to buy anything else? - No, that's it. Let me take this. This street is lovely. - You think so? Of course. - I've never noticed. We've always lived here. I used to play here as a child. It looks like the street where Stendhal sought Matilde. With gardens and balconies like these. But you've never been to Milan? - No, but that's how I imagined it. Intimate, with a taste of secrecy Now I understand many things: snow on Christmas. The truth is that Christmas here is different. We've arrived. Here? I've already made you waste too much time. No, indeed, I was thinking maybe we could get a coffee. Or maybe some tea. As you wish. Instead, why don't you have it at my place? You can meet my parents. It'd be a pleasure. There's no one here. Please make yourself at home. No, let me... - I'm used to it, thank you. Take off your coat. Excuse the mess. Poor dad... 30 years a tailor and he always messed up the shoulders. Sit down, please. - Thanks. Excuse me. I hope you like marsala. There's nothing else. Help yourself? Excuse me a moment. See, that was quick, right? Something wrong? - No, on the contrary Do you know? I... Are you also a tailor? - No, I lack the patience. Only my dad. But the model is mine. Dad and I wanted to do great things together But in order to be successful, it's not enough to have talent or imagination. What do you think: with or without earrings? Um... are they real? - I wish. I only bought them for Mass. But they're graceful, modern. But I'm a modern girl, don't you think so? I'm even into sports. It was officially recognized, and even in the press. Check this out. That's you? Last summer I had a taste of celebrity I went into that world. It was very nice. And then... Then? I got bored. I went back to two hours a day And what did they have to say here at home? My mother rather liked it. She wanted to realize in me, all of her dreams. When I told her I quit, she was very hurt. I dated a rich young man... so handsome. He said he loved me. I believed him. But I woke up, just in time. And so you resigned yourself to teaching. Yes, and now I must take that exam. But it's so difficult and I'm not ready That's why I'm here. If you need help, don't hesitate. No, thanks. That would ruin any good opinion you have of me. But you're intelligent, have the will. You've shown it! Thanks. Thanks for your confidence. What shall we drink to? Shall we say... our friendship? - To your future. Now, I must go. - Where? Over there with my relatives: a family evening. Of course. It's Christmas. Thanks for all. You're very nice. I'm sure you have your commitments. Me? Um... yes, of course! Well then, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. No worries, Sir, go on, don't worry. Hey stop being a pain! Good morning, Sir. - Morning. You see how the girls are today? It's spring, deal; and above all, Sunday! Good day. - Goodbye. Can you really convince him? - Yes, but you must speak too. As you wish, but what's important is that he's convinced. Trilli lacks the necessary competence. Fine, but he's my friend. He's honest and intelligent. I'm not contradicting you. - Allow me... Please, don't get up. - Thanks. I need a vase. - I'll get it. Some coffee? - No, thanks. - Did you see who's there? Who is it? Give me the vase. - One moment, this is Mr. Serafini. Pleased to meet you. - I'll get some water You see this? - What? The shirt naturally comes out. The only reason I mention it, is because it's a common defect in all shirts. Exactly. - Here you are. No doubt Mr. Mucci has told you about my shirt invention. There are so many suspicious... - You don't say! like fishermen with flies. But I'm different! Note: stretchable and neat. The mechanism for my invention is very simple: thanks to the zipper you can reach, everything is united, logical and interchangeable. A minute. Why do you think our grandfathers had a buttonhole on their flaps? Because it could hold the shirt and pants well and maintain smoothness. I've improved on it. - What do you think? Of the shirt-pants? - Yeah. No, this is an original Ciacci. It goes here. Voilà! Lightweight and very fresh. No annoying ripples, always in order and decent, even in moments of intimacy And it saves on the bottom of the shirt. Do I tell it or you? Yes, it's an interesting idea, If you want to run the risk... No, allow me. With my manufacturing system, there'll be no risk. Please, I haven't the slightest doubt. But can you put on your pants? I'm expecting company Alright. - Well then, what shall we do? Pilade, what exactly do you want? To know whether I should invest in this business. No, you want me to decide for you. But this business with the shirt-pants seems risky OK, but you'd never have to change. - You're a dreamer! So you are, with the 20 years you think you have. I'm sorry but I can't wait anymore. There's no harm in reading the contract, right? What contract? Show me. - The lawyer's waiting. I'm not moving from here. - I'm sorry good day Wait a minute. You've waited so long, you can wait a little longer right? What's that? The St. Vitus dance? - I'm as calm. It's for me, I'll go. Good day. - Good day Please. You look very elegant today When seasons change, I change skin. You... look perfect as always. And I must say I didn't expect that. Nothing special: last year's clothes. - But it's taste that counts. Thank you. What beautiful flowers. - Yes. Do you like flowers? Yes, but they make me sad. Because you must be happy in order to appreciate spring. You yourself said I'm unpredictable, but no matter Look, I've been studying the whole lesson. Dante. "So gentle and so honest..." You know that? "So gentle and honest seems my beloved..." No, not like that! "So gentle and honest seems my beloved when greeting others, "the tongue trembles and remains mute and the eyes..." Lawyer make yourself at home. You can sit in... the kitchen. Please sit, Sir. There was an ashtray... Where did it go? I've drafted two contracts. - Yes. If I may read it. - Let's hear it. "Pilade Mucci present here and Vincenzo Serafini present here," "undertake, with this contract, to respect the terms" "of the following bilateral agreement." The lawyer's here. Go on. "Considering that Vincenzo Serafini," "has patented his invention legally...” "And so gentle in her actions that no one can look on her" "without sighing love." This sonnet is dedicated to Beatrice. You read it well as if you believed it. Yes, and don't say you don't believe it! Even if it were true, what use is it to me anymore? Why "anymore"? Can you come here a minute, please? Sorry I'll be right back. The lawyer has come. - So? - You can read the contract. Now? - Yes, now I must get this to him. You'll have to market the product within 2 months. If not, the patent'll return to Serafini. - Of course, if no one buys. Do what you want, the contract is fine. Well? - Where is it? I wonder where my ashtray went. Are you signing or not? I don't know... here in the kitchen? - Yes. Yes, I know but at your age melancholy is a luxury Let's not be so romantic. The time has come to tell the truth. To show you who I really am. Do you remember the young man I told you about? I was very much in love. Completely I was his. That's how one says it, no? Yeah, so then? So then... nothing. For him... it was just a fling... like so many others. For me, though... Ah, yes. The usual story The story I always thought happened to others, but it happened to me. - But that’s, over, right? Yeah, I know Life goes on. The proof is that I'm here. But how do I explain, what I feel now, feels so strange... almost unreal. Come now, Laura. just think that in 2 months you'll be before the examiners. That's reality There's little time. You mustn't make me look bad. Yes, you're right. You're so nice. Thank you. Now then... "Education for Freedom". That's a big problem today Sorry to interrupt, Miss, but it's important. Just a minute. We must settle our accounts: you owe me 35,000 lire. Now? - Yes, give it to me, please, I need money for all this. I signed. Look: lawyer registration and lots of other things. I can give you this, and the rest tomorrow Yes, why don't we go halfway? You can ask for a loan? - No can do. Right. Silence! What's so funny? Give that to me! What's this? You wanted the map right away? Newsletters for the 2nd quarter Pilade, the phone. Silence! Now I'll collect the notebooks. Excuse me. Badini! Brambilla! Excuse me, Miss. Yes, it's Mucci. - Miss! - I can't right now Take this, Miss. No, no, don't tie it. Cut the cloth. That's all you need. You need to improve and stop annoying your classmates. Go! Excuse me. - We're at it again? Crippa. You're not even listening. This quarter was worse than the first. What should I do? Tell me. Take it. Go. Mr. Trilli, please come to the office. Yes, Sir... Silence! Boys, I'm counting on you. The president will be responsible for discipline. Mr. Trilli! You said that after giving out grades, we could elect a new president. Fine. Meanwhile, prepare the ballots. Don't move from there, OK? Don't worry This time you're choosing me! - What are you doing? Go to your seats! Pilade, the phone. - Who is it? I don't know. - What a day! Guys, stay calm: I'll be gone for a moment. You go to the blackboard and write... No, don't write anything. I'll be right back. Here, vote for me! - Quiet, guys. Keep quiet! - The election must be clean. You want to end up like before? - Go on. Colonnetti, come here. Let's go to Crippa. Yes. - Come on. Tip! Tip! Tip! Tip! Tip! Vote for me! - Will you leave me alone? Who are you going to vote for? - Who I like. - He's the best! Come on, Brushes, come on! You idiot! Look... - I'll kill you! Go on, Colonnetti! They published your article... have you seen it? On the first page. May I? - Of course. What's that? What going on here? Are you crazy? Silence! Why were these children left alone? - Crippa, come here. Was it you? - You come here. I made sure they weren't left alone. - I was gone for only a moment. Enough. You may go. - Was it you? What did they say? What did they do? Who did this to you? Speak! I want to know what happened. Someone's responsible! - Enough. The discipline of the school won't tolerate this kind of behavior You two are suspended for three days. You'll come back with your parents. And you will buy him a new smock. Good day Attention! Go back to your seats. You two, go wash up. Hello, Headmaster! Mr. Trilli, I've seen the note. May I have a few words with you? - By all means. You wait in the can Listen, is my son smart or not? He's smart but he never studies, not even a word. - Indeed. But you could promote him and make him study during the summer vacation. You understand? In these last few weeks, you could give him lessons, extra work. You know that it is forbidden? No, you're wrong. Your son is suspended for now I'm sorry but that's the way it is. Too bad, I had already prepared for you to stay at the Villa at a good salary Thanks, but it's not possible. - Well, it's a question of point of view You may change your mind. Remember life can be harder than you, Mr. Trilli. Goodbye, Sir - Farewell, and think it oven Good day, Sir, Please, come in. A shave? A haircut? - A massage. May I? - Go right ahead. What are you doing there? Get the broom, move it. The gentleman is served. - Brush! Tip! - Thanks! Thank you! The gentleman is served. - Magnificent! How true it is! I'm pleased. People in Milan care about their schools, in my opinion. What is your occupation? - I'm a teacher in Ripamonti. Ah... I congratulate you. - Brush! Thank you. Good day Sir Come here. Don't worry about the smock, we'll take care of it. - I must pay it, Sir What did he want? - He's my teacher Who can teach an ass like you? Now then... Tomorrow we visit a car factory, the OMT. You've heard of it, right? Yes! - Who wants to go? Me! Me! Me! No, you're too many We can only pick ten. Let's see. You want to go to the OMT? Silence! Let's look at the homework. Did you do this? You like cars? Very nice. It's well done. I'll award you for the drawing and take you to the car factory What's that murmuring? Calcaterra! Nothing, Sir. Nothing, eh?

Buyers don't travel to Milan just to buy a shirt. You must supply all kinds of shops. From the center to the periphery Only then can you reach everybody Couldn't you use less cellophane? No, the cellophane is presentation. This is what we need. It's publicity! Look here, we have publicity 30,000 lire for two days. Besides, we told everybody. - What? To pass the word. That's publicity? Wallpapering the city is a must. You must excite the people's imagination. Astound them! You once said something very wise. Tell me again what you said about the invention. I said so many things... - Try to remember say something... Bring me a coffee! - Practical, elegant, sporty... No, keep speaking what you said, any phrase even if it's stupid. The shirt-pants: an advance! It even rhymes. - No, stop, wait. No, nothing... keep working. Slowly be careful of the dishes. One moment! I broke it and put it under there. - How terrible! Yes, it was horrible. It was wrong because I was thinking about more important things. I need a slogan for advertising. Did you remember? Think. I also said something about the flap. Yes, grandpa's flap. - That's it: grandpa. Grandpa works. Grandpa... - Good day. Morning, Sin; please come in. - Come on, boys. Is everything ready? Yes, I've prepared everything for the home mortgage. You have 15 promissory notes worth a million and a half. Satisfied? Please sit, Sir He'll be here in a moment. Pilade, where are you going?

It's the last one! - I'm busy, Sir, very busy Then the business is incomplete. Then I'll sign, I'm the fiduciary of the business. I'll fix it with the Notary At worst, I'll pay it off with my pension. - Pension? But you're not teaching. While on leave, if all goes well, I'll quit. Bravo! Congratulations with all my heart. You're right! "Grandpa was right." "Grandpa was right!" That'll be the slogan, the flap! What a find! - Where's the publicist. Are you any good? - I did the manifesto for" Very well! This slogan will be worth millions! It'll be the talk of Milan! "Grandpa was right!" Here it is, Mr. Mucci. That'll be 5,000 lire? - 5,000? I thought you said a 1,000? Mr. Trilli said 5,000. - I'm the one who pays! 1,000! A 1,000 is nothing: we're in Milan. How does it come to 5,000 lire? Here's how: 100 by 140, 6 in color 190 each, comes to 950 lire. You save 50 lire because it should be 200 per each, but you know Mr. Trilli. Alright fine... 5,000 lire. Anything else? Of course! Not including taxes or the glue. What glue? - Advertising needs glue. Is the stuff ready? Hi, Pilade. - Most of its ready here. The rest is coming. Is this yours? Damn! To each his own. Mr. Trilli made it. - Huh? Good.

Excuse me. - Of course. Sold? - Mortgaged. Good. And surely there were promissory notes? Who was it? - With the lawyer Costarossa. Good. - How is it good? Bad! Very bad! You shouldn't have done it. But the shirt-pants is a safe bet! - What about the competition? But I have the patent. - Patents can be copied. How? - A change here, a change there. It's done. You should've consulted me. You've known me for years. Instead you got yourself in a real mess. Sir... - The bill, Mr. Mucci. I thought I saved 950? - It includes sales tax. The sales tax! One fights all one's life for a house, and you instead... Dear Pilade, I leave you with your work. Sir! - Go on, speak! You're a businessman. You can help me, take charge of it! With the millions you have, my product would be good business. You should've thought of that before. I've too many obligations now I'll cede to you what it cost me. I'm content with little. What role has Trilli in it? - The writer nothing. I'll take charge of it, you should be thankful. Accountant, can we go to your office? Of course. - Fine.

Yes! - Now, will speak Mr... - Dante Trilli! Mr. Dante Trilli, who has dedicated his life to the highest and most noble goal: education. Go ahead, Sir Gentlemen... - Louder! Ladies and gentlemen, we have seen what elementary teachers are. Let me tell you about one who... Yes... one that by now... I can't find the words worthy of them. They are heroes. As our Manzoni says, "Courage... you cannot teach it." Therefore, not all have it. And we must value those who do. But these here, who haven't hesitated for one moment, who never boasted, who have forgotten themselves to remind others who they are. And many others who aren't here. To them, who represent our entire country from Trieste to Sicily let us remember them. Because if they've sacrificed themselves for their vocation, then it's time to recognize their due. And if any of you can't see us, you must looks inwards, because you'll find us where everything that is good, clean, true remains, above all, in our consciousness. I say again, "Bravo". When do you resign? Well, I requested a leave. - Goodbye. Goodbye, Trilli. Thanks for everything. Thanks. - I hope to see you again. I hope so too. Be quiet! Be good! Stay in line! The substitute hasn't arrived yet. Come on! The last ten go to A. The others to C. Let's go! But Mr. Trilli is here. - Yes, we saw him! Yes, he was below. - So? He's not coming! Come on! I told you to go to C! Go! What are you waiting for? The teacher! - Sir! Sir! Mr. Trilli, what's happening? - Nothing at all. See? We're causing a ruckus. Go to class. - Let's go, come on! Sit down! Children, I have always treated you like men. I have only come in to tell you... Crippa! There was a lot of work in the garage, so, I'm late. Fine, but what about summer school? I passed, Sir Go to your seat. Children, we are in 5th. This year we have our diploma. We must work very hard. Pilade? - What? - Got a knife? - Of course! But now it's a German one. - How much? Today, it's a gift. English subtitles by sineintegral@KG
