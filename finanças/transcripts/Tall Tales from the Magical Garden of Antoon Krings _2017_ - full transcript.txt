Your hive is magnificent, your loving people are organizing a grandiose celebration. So? You're right, Larry. And you know how much I love you all too. It's just that sometimes I'd just like to be an ordinary little bug. Come on! You know it well, Your Majesty. Solitude is a queen's jewellery. Our majesty. My queen. Come now, dearest louse, we have work to do. (BUZZING) (THUDDING) Good morning, Your Majesty! Hello, everyone. My queen, my queen, the buds are opening. Very well, send a team. Right away, Your Majesty. Could you sign these orders, Your Majesty? Right, right. Please remember to tell the foraging bees to focus on the rose bush this morning. Yes, Your Majesty. This wall needs to be finished as soon as possible. Good work! Thank you, Your Majesty. Look, Larry! The fresh honey! Hello everyone. Good morning your majesty. Good morning! Great job. Now start extracting the royal jelly. Right away, Queen Marguerite! How's the celebration coming along? Fantastic! There are still a few things to do, but we will be ready. Queen Marguerite! We need you in the nursery. Don't worry. A little drop of royal jelly will make everything better. Coochy-coochy, Coochy-coochy-coo! Oh! (CHUCKLING) (WHIMSICAL MUSIC) (SIGHING) (CLEARING THROAT) Your Majesty? Huh, yes, what is it? This is the official harvest report. Bush number one has been processed.

Hi, Lily! Hi! They're setting up the boats! 3, 2, 1. Cheater! Last one there has to sleep in the hornet's nest! I won! Yeah! I won, I won! Flying is cheating! No, it's not! Yes, it is! No, it's not! Yes, it, Look, what's that? BEE: Should we wake him up? BEE: No, stop! Yes! Hey! (GASPING) Hello, boys! Good morning, sir. Who are you? Who am I? A magician! Maja-cuididai! Wow! Get your rose water! Huh? And... ta-da! Oh, no, no, no, no, no! Stop right there! No, no (THUDDING) Oh, Kids, I've told you a million times, do not talk to strangers. Um, Mr Benny, who's the funny looking man? Well, hello Mr Benny. Apollo Cricket at your service. Right. How do you do, sir? Well, sorry, but we're extremely busy. Come on kids, off you go. Go on, we have a lot to prepare for the Queen's jubilee! Can I, can I, can I help with the garlands? BEE: Yeah, me too! Please, Mr Benny? (LAUGHING) The Queen's jubilee? Come on, Apollo. Its show time! (WHISTLING) Mmm, that looks good! No, Bartley, you have to wait. Preparations are almost finished. Oh, that's very pretty, Lily. Thank you, Betty. (GASPING) Hey! Hmph, the Queen's Jubilee! This is all well and good for the hillbilly bugs. Ladies and gentlebugs, (CARNIVAL MUSIC) put down your trays and hammers for a minute, the show's about to begin. Come one, come all! Sweet creatures of the garden! Funny little bugs of all shapes. Bush number 77 has been processed. Is that a show? What is going on now? I must see it! Come on, Your Majesty! This is unacceptable! You're supposed to stay indoors. Come and discover today's new talent. Prepare to be dazed and amazed. An artist as gifted as he is. Another traveling performer. You know him, you love him. Here he is, Apollo the Wonder-cricket! Who's that traveller? BEE: A vagabond cricket. BEE: I never heard of that guy. And now that I've captured the audience's attention, let the show begin! (KOOKY MUSIC) (CHUCKLING) (CROWD OOHING) Hey, funny man! Can you please take your circus at somewhere else? Look at him! I've never seen a cricket like that. Who's that clown? I smell trouble. (SNICKERING) Trouble, trouble. (SNICKERING) (CRASHING) Look at this mess. Please, forgive me! I don't know what happened. I'm terribly sorry. Hey, listen, bozo. Why don't you go and see how green the grass is on the other side? Look at the mess he made! Do you want to ruin the Queen's jubilee? Right! Hit the road, cricket! We've had enough of you already. Wait! Don't leave before I pass the hat! Please! Go on, scram! Arrivederci! Ciao, you parasite! Bohemian! Freegroats! He didn't sound that bad. Your Majesty! Are you joking? Don't you see the mess he just made in the garden? Oh, if I could just go out I would know! Do you realize that I'm not allowed to help with the preparation, or go out as I please? Think of it this way: to us you are the sun and the stars. The heart of this garden. You're luminescent. You're too precious. Ha, so precious that it must cost me my freedom? This rule that says the queen can't leave the hive except on her birthday, isn't it absurd? I know, Your Highness, but that's our tradition. Was it not to shake up tradition a little that I decided to appoint someone like you and take you under my wing, my loveable louse? That's true. You chose me over another bee, your cousin Wendy, who, by the way, was not particularly pleased about it. She's always been very jealous. You look like you need a hand. Oh, how nice of you, miss. Betty, Betty Bee. Thank you, Miss Betty. You know, you shouldn't judge them too harshly. People here aren't used to seeing... Strangers? Don't worry, I'm used to that. No, it's not about that. I meant, everyone's really busy preparing for Queen Marguerite's jubilee. Ah, I wish I could have played for her jubilee. This is for you. How very kind of you. It's... It's just that... Betty! Betty come on! We need you to start hanging the decorations! I'm sorry, I have to go. Are you gonna be OK? No problem, Miss Betty. Nothing ever bugs me. (GASPING) huh? Hello there. Um, hi! I'm Wendy Wasp. You know, I absolutely loved your show. Oh, you did, really? Well that makes one of you! Of course! You're very talented. You know, people in this village have no appreciation for artists. Listen, I'll make you a deal: I want to prepare a little surprise for the Queen's jubilee, but for that I'd need you to draw her away from the hive. A surprise? What kind of surprise? Something special, so she doesn't feel so lonely all the time. Really? How do you know all this? Well, I'm her cousin, you see. Oh, I don't know. I'm only a stranger here. Suit yourself, cricket. That's too bad. You could have become the official palace singer. You could have settled down here, made a home in this garden. But if you're not interested... A home? Wait! Miss Wendy, I'm in! You've got a deal! Great. I'm sure she's going to love you. Come with me, I'll tell you where to find the queen tonight. No one knows this, but sometimes the queen leaves her palace in secret. Work day's over! Come on, guys! Everybody home! (GRUNTING) I beg of you, Your Highness, don't go out again tonight! You know I need it, my dear Larry. But what for? I need to get away. Even if it's only for an hour! It's so cold out there! To be surrounded by nature, in the sleeping garden. Scary! With the stars above me... Dark! Beautiful! Alone! - You understand? - You understand? Oh. Boo! Are you afraid of the Pest? What about the drooling bat with bloodshot eyes? It could swallow you whole! Calm down! Another bee would just take my place. That day will come eventually anyway. My word! She's not even joking! Phoebe? Phoebe! (WHIMSICAL MUSIC) Wendy told me to turn left after the bridge and... Hmm. That's not the queen! That's the little beggar from the village. (HUMMING) ♪ When my sweetheart seems to far ♪ ♪ I wish upon a star ♪ ♪ je vois la vie en rose ♪ Sorry, I didn't want to startle you but I love that old song and you have such a pretty voice. Thank you. I saw you at the village last night. You were singing on the bridge. Yes, that was me. And you? What are you doing here? Well, I'm not sure any more. I was looking for the queen. Have you seen her? No, why? Too bad. That's all right, I just wanted to meet her. The queen? Nobody gets to meet the queen. She's way too busy and essential. Why do you want to meet her anyway? Oh, you really want to know? Wait, I'll show you! Apollo Cricket! The greatest music hall star there ever was! Apollo toured the palaces of Europe and the biggest concert halls in the world! I was the king in my field. Well. I played the Paris Opera Hive! Bugland, Carnabee Hall. The Beetlepolitan. The Bugno Café. The Vegetable Square Garden! Ah yes. (GIGGLING) MAN: Boo, get off the lily pad! Get out of here! And then, one day, I lost everything. So here I am. A travelling performer without a troupe, without an audience. But now, I have a hope in my heart. The queen? I would be so happy to play for her jubilee. But I don't think that's going to happen. Just my luck. If only I could have met her. But I know, she's so important. So busy, she's the queen! Yes, of course, she has to care about everybody here. She has so much responsibility. Exactly. I understand why she has no time for a loser like me. (GIGGLING) You said you lost everything. What happened? Oh, that is a really long story. Anyway, enough about me. You didn't even tell me your name. I'm... I'm Marguerite. So, Marguerite, what brings you here? Oh, that's a long story. (KOOKY MUSIC) (SNORING) Goodnight, guys! Huh? (BUZZING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) PESTS: We are the Pests! It's bad we do best! We are the Pests! It's bad we do best! We sleep all day. At night we play. We'll steal your stuff. And fly away. You'd better hide Because tonight we ride. Boo! (LAUGHING) We are the Pests, the best of the pests! (BOOMING) ALL: All night we plunder and fight, and fill your night with fear and fright! We are the Pests, the best of the pests! Blitz on the garden. (SQUEAKING) Hey, boss, I feel ready for another raid tonight. Chill the bug out, Daddy Boom. WENDY: Hello, Sphinx. Wendy! To what do we owe the displeasure? Watch your mouth, grandpa! Easy, General Helium. Tell me, Sphinx, my old friend, I see you're still looting around like a bunch of pirates. It must be really sad for you and your uh, (CHUCKLING) merry bugs. So what? You've been dangling a grand scheme in front of us for months, but it still hasn't put any honey in our pockets. Funny you should say that. An impromptu arrival has just given us the last piece of the puzzle. If our agreement still stands, we're moving tonight. We'll hold our end of the bargain and in exchange, you'll deliver us a full load of honey. Let's shake on it. Yeah, let's not and say we did. Out of my way, squirt! Are you looking for a fight? (SCREECHING) (GASPING) Helium! The Vampire's on the prowl. Mickey, Daddy Boom, Incognito! Let's move. Quick! Make a wish! You see those stars on the left? That's the constellation of the bee. See? (GIGGLING) Yes, I can see it now. And look over there! This is the constellation of the troubadour. Oh yeah! Good eye, Marguerite! You know, next to it, there's the constellation of the little beggar. Two wanderers among the stars. Actually... the one right next to the troubadour is the constellation of Marguerite, the Queen Bee. The Queen Bee? Queen Marguerite! Woah! Your Majesty, Your Grace! If I had only known... I messed up again. Once more, I am so sorry, I... Sorry for what? For having been sweet and kind? Don't worry. You're not from here, but you're a credit to our village. Just one thing: no one can know you saw me here. That will be our secret. Do you understand? Of course. You have my word, Your Majesty. Would you sing that song we like, for me? Oh, I don't know... I... Don't sing for the queen, sing for the little beggar. ♪ When my sweetheart seems so far ♪ ♪ I wish upon a star ♪ ♪ Je vois la vie en rose ♪ Come with me. I know exactly where to go. ♪ Then the beauty of the song ♪ ♪ Reminds us we belong ♪ ♪ Together in our souls ♪ ♪ Oh the sun and moon both know ♪ ♪ Such love can only grow ♪ ♪ Je vois la vie en rose ♪ It's such a beautiful song.

My hive seems even more beautiful than ever. (SIGHING) I wish I could just enjoy it. Queen Marguerite, I think we should head back. Come on, Apollo, I've never seen my garden in a more beautiful light. And look at that moon. It's a real honey moon. Those golden reflections... that light is magic, isn't it? Oh yes, the moon. Let me pluck it from the sky for you. A teardrop from heaven. And now... magic! Magic acridiadai! (LAUGHING) (CACKLING) What a great show, cricket! So sweet! (LAUGHING) The Pests. What are you doing here? Thanks for delivering the package. We'll take it from here, cricket. Wait, what? - Apollo? - Me? Was this a trap? Of course not, Marguerite! I've never met these people. I don't know... (SCREECHING) Holy antennae! The vampire! Marguerite! MARGUERITE: Help! Help me! Marguerite! Over here, you bad bat! I didn't mean that! You misunderstood! (GRUNTING) That is one crazy cricket! Ouch! (SNARLING) (TENSE MUSIC) I'm not going, I'm going. I'm not going, I'm going. I'm not going, I'm not going, I'm not going. I don't believe it. Okay, I'm going. "The queen has gone to Lovers' Corner "and I think she's in danger." The Queen! The Queen is in danger! The queen! You, follow me! To the watering can! I mean now! Apollo? Apollo? There you are. Boys, this lady here is worth her weight in honey. (LAUGHING) No, help, please. Help me! Help! Help! Marguerite? Your Majesty? Your Majesty, are you? Oh no! Marguerite! Oh, Marguerite. Mm? Hmmm. Wendy! It's horrible, horrible! Queen Marguerite has disappeared! Disappeared? Really? It was a nightmare. There was a gang of scary pests and worst of all a huge vampire. What on earth are you talking about? There he is! That's him! That is him! The stray roach! We've got him! What? Where is our queen, stranger? Answer me! This is all a misunderstanding. Wendy, please, you must tell him! Tsk, tsk, tsk. What have you done? Me? I haven't done anything! I'm innocent! Sphinx Moth, why? How could you? It's very simple, Your Majesty. Thanks to you we'll soon get more money than we've ever had before. A mountain of gold! Got to feed my men, you know. (SOMBER MUSIC) You plan on holding me for ransom? Let's say I accepted a business proposition. I knew you were a thief, but a kidnapper? You know you're just as bad as the bats. That's enough. Look at my wing. The bat did that. That monster was never one of us. Every time we venture outside to feed, we risk life, limb and wing. We never had a choice. We do what we can to survive. But we could have found a solution. You sweet little day bugs have always shunned us nocturnal creatures. Because you're always robbing and bullying us. But we can still change things. Can we jam her now? Jam, jam! No, Nicky. Incognito, lock her in the dungeon. Yes, Boss! (BIRDS CHIRPING) Hey, where are you going? I'm a forager. I'm going to forage. But which flower? Where are we supposed to go this morning? That's a good question. The queen didn't tell us anything today. And where is the queen anyway? (SCREAMING) Has anybody seen the queen? Hey, Bartley! You know what happened? What's going on? I heard the vampire scream in the night. What's going on? The queen has gone missing. We're looking all over for her. We've got him! Don't look any further, my friends. We have the guilty party. He masterminded the whole thing. Apollo, You? I've done nothing wrong! Please believe me! I'm innocent! Where's our queen, cricket? Is she even alive? For all we know the queen has been devoured by the vampire. Or handed over to the Pests! Down with the stranger! CROWD: Down with the stranger! Down with the stranger! Down with the stranger! Friends, calm down! He's innocent until proven guilty! I saw him by the watering can. There were footprints and in his hand he had... This! ALL: Huh? Oh, I mean this! (GASPING) Boo! Go back to where you came from! Shame! Shame! Get out of here, foreigner! BEE: Down with the stranger! Down with the stranger! Down with the stranger! Cricket bad! Bad old cricket! Get out of here! (CHUCKLING) General Helium, now is the time. Yes, my Queen. Friends, calm down. Luckily, Wendy captured the stranger, otherwise he would have left the garden already. What? No, no, no, no, you're mistaken! Wendy, you're the one who... Wendy? What? You took advantage of our trusting and welcoming nature. The guilty cricket shall be punished. He will be given as an offering to the vampire. The, the, the what? Let me out! I'm innocent! I was framed! If you're really a magician, do the great escape trick! (LAUGHING) You're so funny. Wait, wait, wait... you hear that? (OMINOUS MUSIC) Dear friends, everything leads us to believe that our beloved Marguerite might never return home. No! And as you know, the hive cannot remain without a leader. I'll be your new queen until further notice. (GASPING) I'm declaring a curfew as of tonight. The honey bees must pledge allegiance to us and keep the hive running. Those who refuse will be immediately banished. What, the queen? - Shh. - Imprisoned or squashed. And finally, the jubilee garden party will be replaced by a grand wasp ball to celebrate my coronation. You may leave now. WASP: Hey, the new queen told you to leave. Go on, back to work. I don't think I'm gonna like this. Yes, well I don't think we have much of a choice. Well then, let's go save the hive. Louse! Come here! (SNORING) (LAUGHING) If my memory serves me right, it's around here. The most precious treasure in the whole garden and whoever controls the royal jelly controls the hive. (CACKLING) Who's there? We're here to make a deposit. Honey, so much honey! I hope it's the amount we agreed on. What do you mean? You don't trust us? Calm down, Verminator. Mickey's young and restless. He still has to learn that he can trust a good traitor. Now, what did you call me? Enough! You have your reward, Sphinx, now take me to her. (GASPING) Wendy! Oh, I'm so happy you found me! Hmmm, what a delightful place. A bit damp, maybe, but isn't that exactly what you wished for? To be just another ordinary little bug? You, you're with them? Why? We've known each other forever. Yes, we did grow up together, but then you cast me away because I was just a wasp. Wendy... Admit it! I never wanted you to feel rejected, but you do know that only a bee can run a beehive? Well, we'll see about that. I will soon be crowned and I shall reign over the hive. Your little garden will become a royal jelly making machine and I'll be the most powerful queen ever! No, you don't understand! Being queen means you have to protect the garden and every single one of its inhabitants. If you unsettle it, you'll run our garden to the ground. The whole village knows that. They'll never obey you. That's right. You haven't heard the news. You've been assassinated, dear. What? But don't you worry about a thing. That vagabond cricket will be punished for that horrible crime. Apollo? You'd better forget about him. Oh no! Forever. Wendy! Oh and Sphinx, tomorrow you will bring me the queen's head. What? That was never part of our deal. Winter is coming, Sphinx. You wouldn't want me to deprive you of our honey, would you? (GRUMBLING) Then we agree. See you tomorrow, Sphinx. This deal is getting worse all the time. Go on! Work harder, you lazy bees! This is the life! We should have done this a long time ago. Back to work! WASP: Faster! (LAUGHING) (LAUGHING) (GLASSES CLINKING) Marguerite. Apollo. ♪ When my sweetheart seems to far ♪ ♪ I wish upon a star ♪ ♪ Je vois la vie en rose ♪ (HUMMING) Well Apollo, is that all? Yes, it is. Did you really think your life could change, just because of... love? ♪ Then the beauty of the song ♪ ♪ reminds me we belong ♪ ♪ together in our souls ♪ ♪ And when we dance it's like flight ♪ ♪ it's like light ♪ ♪ And when he smiles I'm alive ♪ ♪ such delight ♪ Love! You know what I like best about that blade, Boss? It's that we never use it, and I hope we never will. Give me that! She told you to kill me, didn't she? I understand. You want to protect your own, Sphinx Moth, but if you follow Wendy and her madness, the garden will die. You and your men will no longer be able to live there. We've got no other choice. We always have a choice, Sphinx. Not enough portraits of me around here. That needs to change, pronto! Wendy, we had a problem. The tank's not filling up fast enough and the honey quality is decreasing. Don't worry, I know an excellent motivational tool. Tell the bees they must double their efforts. If they don't, all their precious babies will be abandoned at the far end of the garden by this time tomorrow! And if some of them keep resisting, they will face the same punishment as that annoying cricket. (CACKLING) What? So the queen is alive? And you think Wendy is behind all this? Yes. She's made a secret pact with the Pests. BOTH: (gasping) Unbelievable! But far from surprising. This is a disaster. We must save our queen. That's our only hope. If we bring Marguerite back, the whole village will know Wendy's lying. And the queen will reclaim her throne. Great but, how do we do it? Do you think kidnappers release their prisoners just because you ask them to, as in, "Hey guys, we're here to pick up the queen". Well, we could try. Maybe we could fly there. Right, and end up being gobbled up by the vampire? Might as well put up a big neon sign: Free Food! Free Food! You're right. We have to... (KNOCKING) BEES: Larry? We need to stop Wendy! The crown has gone to her head. She's not even thinking straight! She's enslaving the worker bees and threatening the babies! If she keeps going the hive will die and the whole garden with it! We've no time to lose! Fiona and Bartley stay here and keep an eye on things. Larry and Phoebe, you're with me. We'll free Apollo and find the lair. Here, a little gift of my own invention. You might find it useful. It's a sword! Yes, yes! This is so cool. My friends, tonight we're saving our queen. - Yeah! - Yeah! (LAUGHING) (SNORING) - (BAT SCREECHING) - Huh? Who goes there? Quick! Run! Well done! It worked! Now let's free our friend. Psst, don't be afraid, it's me, Betty! Oh! Wait! Miss Betty, I'm innocent! Wendy framed me! I know, don't worry. Phoebe explained everything. There's one thing you need to know: the queen is alive! Marguerite, alive? Oh, thank you! Thank you! Ouch! Come on, Apollo, we need to move fast. Where are we going? To save Marguerite! To save our garden! Hey, wait up! You want to attack the Pests? Yes. With your help we can do it. My help? Oh, don't worry, Apollo. We can do this. I can't do anything for you. I'm sorry, Betty. I'm the one who doomed the garden. If I hadn't taken the queen to Lover's Corner, if I hadn't shown off for her the way I did... It's not your fault, Apollo, we've all been played by Wendy. No. I know I'm to blame for everything, once again. What do you mean, once again? Does it have anything to do with that poster? What? The crickets on that poster. What happened to them? You know, all gardens are not as welcoming to artists. There's even one where music is strictly forbidden. One day, I convinced my brothers to go perform there with our troupe, The Magic Band. But it all went wrong. They set fire to our stage. WOMAN: You have no right to be here! MAN: Down with crickets! WOMAN: Get out! MAN: Crickets have six legs! WOMAN: Get out! I understand, Apollo. You know, I missed my old family too. But Queen Marguerite took me in, even though I was from a different hive. I'm sorry, Apollo. I was wrong about you. Our garden needs people like you. We'll never replace your brothers, but from now on you won't ever be alone, I promise. Here, take it. You're worthy of it. Right! Come on! We have a queen to save. Take the candelabras out of storage and deck all the tables in black. We'll use mother's silverware. The venom carafes to dip our stingers will go over there. Don't forget the bouquets. Let me check the guest list. The Grand Cross of the Hemlock, the Order of the Golden Wasps' Nest. (CLEARING THROAT) Wendy, I just heard that several villagers have fled. What? Who dared? The little bee who lives by herself down in the village. She tricked the guards and freed the cricket. That cricket! And that nasty little honey bee. How is it even possible? Well now, we won't let ourselves be distracted by such minor annoyances. My ball will be the most grandiose one ever. Nothing like their pathetic little jubilees. (TENSE MUSIC) (SNORING) We're in! OK, let's go find Marguerite very quietly. (GROWLING) (GASPING) It's a shame but sometimes you have to make the hard choice and live with the consequences. (MARGUERITE SCREAMING) Marguerite! Come with me. We need to have a little chat. I knew you'd make the right decision. Hands off my queen, Sphinx Moth or I'll give you a taste of... Apollo? The cricket's alive? Apollo! Marguerite, I'm so sorry! I didn't know it would end like this! Wendy used me! I know, Apollo, don't worry. Fear not, Your Majesty, I will protect you against this rascal. Apollo, about that... No, leave it too me, Marguerite, this pirate will soon be a distant memory. Ready you knave? Attack, parry, attack, parry, attack, the fly, the fly attack, little step, attack, feint, sidestep, sidestep, principal feint, the splits, attack, frog style, frog style, frog style! Marguerite? APOLLO: Pas de bourré, pas de bourré, little steps, little steps. Sorry. Apollo, could I just say? Just a sec, dearest, I'm getting ready for my secret thrust! Ha-ha, the magic! Whoah! Nice move! Didn't even see it coming. Apollo! Apollo are you all right? Apollo? Apollo, can you hear me? Marguerite. Glad to see you too, Phoebe. Hello. What's going on here? It's all right, Apollo. Sphinx Moth has decided to help us. Oh, Marguerite, My Queen! I'm so happy to see you again. So am I, Apollo, I thought I had lost you forever. Here, cricket, have a drink! You'll feel better. Don't just stand there, come and sit with us! Oh, all right. Thank you, sir. Call me Boom, my young friend. Daddy Boom. So, I can't j-j-jab him any more then? No, don't you understand anything? Leave him alone. So, what are you going to do now, Marguerite? We need to take back the hive tonight. We have no other choice. Wendy is over-exploiting the garden. She's draining its resources. And if she harms the babies there won't be anyone to pollinate the flowers, which means no more harvest, no more royal jelly. The hive will die and so will the garden. Even Wendy will have to leave. Everything will fall into ruin and despair. It will be the end of the world. I know it seems impossible, but we have to do something. She's right! Let's go! All right, Apollo! We're with you all the way, Queen Marguerite. We're gonna save the garden! Thank you my dear friends. Those little bugs are totally nuts! But they're as brave as can be. Yeah, that's for sure. Well, Boss? Queen Marguerite, we need the garden just as much as you do. And we can't let anyone say the Pests walked away from a good fight! PESTS: Yeah! We love a good fight! Great speech, Boss! D-d-d-definitely right! Then it's settled. If Your Majesty agrees, we'll fight by your side! (CHUCKLING) All right then. Day bugs and night bugs will fight side by side. EVERYONE: Yeah! All right, all right! That's all well and good but we still need a battle plan. Sphinx Moth is right. Priority number one is to rescue the babies from Wendy's grasp. Hey! Are these beauties yours? They're mine! Old campaign memories. But we never planned on using those against you! I saved them for sentimental reasons. We'll be able to create a diversion, but I have to say we're badly outnumbered. Tell me, Sphinx, would you happen to know where that bat hides? Ah, of course I do. My friends, I believe I have a plan. Please, come in. Welcome! Hey you nurse! Don't just stand there where the guests can see you. Go take care of the babies. Come on! Quick! And you, lousy Louse. Where have you been? Go and wait on the guests. Finally, a grand wasp ball in the hive. That Wendy is a real honey-digger. Say, I wonder, where is the Queen of the Ball? She's getting ready. She'll be down soon. (TENSE MUSIC) Impressive, isn't she? That monster is horrible. Let's not get her upset, all right? Well, I'll leave you to it. Can I jab her now? Not now. Calm down. We have to wait for the signal. Here we go! Incognito, Buddy, you want to do the honours? Sir! Yes, sir! Oh there you are. Is everything ready? Yes, everybody's waiting for you. I like to make an entrance. What about the buffet? Served. The crown? Displayed. And my head? Oh you look wonderful. That makeup really suits your graceful features. Not my head, you idiot, the queen's head! Did the Sphinx bring it? Um... well, I mean, no. Not exactly. You... what is that? Oh! Oh! Helium, that's beautiful! I love it. Did you do that for me? Sure I did. (CROWD OOHING AND AAHING) This way, ladies and gentlemen. Don't miss the fireworks. Hey, guys! You're missing a great show. Come on out! Come on, my friends! It's time for action. Betty? Let's take the babies to safety. Follow me! Let's go, girls. Get the babies. (FIREWORKS BOOMING) That was the signal. OK then, let's go. - Can I jab her now? - Shh. - Yeah, but can I jab? - Shh. - Jab her now? - Shh. - Jab her? - Shh. - Jab, jab, jab? - Shh, shh, shh! OK, fine! Wake up! Ha-ha! Oh, boy, oh boy, oh boy! OK, steady! Okay, steady, nice bat! Yeah, go left! No, your other left. No, go down! That's one crazy cricket. Coming from you, I know that's a compliment. It's all right, I think she's starting to like me. Turn around! It's working! I meant to do that! Oops! So what do we do now? We might need to find a new cricket. There we go! It wasn't that hard, was it? Yes, who's my good girl? Yes. And now, let's move out, to the hive! Yee-ha! Should we follow him? Hahaha, of course we should follow him! Come on! (FIREWORKS BOOMING) (CROWD CHATTERING) The coast is clear. Oh, will you look at that! What? Guards! Can't we at least wait for the grand finale? No, you idiot! Look! They're taking their brats out of here! Guards! Guards! Everyone, after them! Betty, all the babies are out of harm's way. Soldiers! Take no prisoners! Party's over, you microbes! In the name of the Hive! Not one more step! (LAUGHING) Squash them! It's going to be a real drama! I know. This is so much fun!(LAUGHING) (LAUGHING) (BAT SCREECHING) That's Apollo! He did it! The cricket? Impossible! We are the Pests! It's bad we do best! We sleep all day, by night we play We'll steal your stuff and fly away! You'd better hide, because tonight we ride! We are the best, and we aint' pests! (TENSE MUSIC) Now, Boss? Can I jab them? Oh yes Mickey! J-jab now! Now you can jab them all! Listen, my bug friends, you've been lied to! Queen Marguerite is alive! The Wasp Ball is over! Now it's time for the Vampire Ball. What? (SCREAMING) Sorry, ladies, the hive is closed. I'm sorry, what? What was that? I can't hear you! Now, onto the real job. Gentlemen, would you be so kind as to give me back the crown, of which I am the one and only guardian? Oh, so we'll have to do it the hard way. (GRUNTING) (LAUGHING) Yeah! Haha! Oooh ah! Aa, yoom! Tink! (CHUCKLING) (BASHING) There you are, you big bully! Now it's between you and me. (WEAPONS CLANGING) My army! Call in reinforcements! (OMINOUS MUSIC) Brave soldiers of the hive, let's show them what we're made of! Yeah! These bees are a real buzz-kill. Somebody help! (CLANKING) (CLANGING) (WEAPONS CLANGING) You're getting too old for this type of thing. (HUFFING) Is that all you've got, Grandpa? (CLANGING) Now, where were we? Oh yes, I was about to give the final blow. So, it's that all you've got, kid? This isn't over yet. Take that. No! No, No! It's over, Wendy. You? But how? Call yourself queen all you want but you don't know half the secrets of the hive. It's time to surrender. Do you think I'll be captured so easily? Do we have a plan B? Uh... no. (LAUGHING) When you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. (MARGUERITE SCREAMING) Marguerite! Don't let go of me! Will you stop your wacko dance? No, no! Apollo! Marguerite, save yourself! I'll take care of her. Your reign of terror ends now, Wendy. That's what you think, cricket. No, I really mean it. I will squash you! Attack, parry, attack, parry attack, the fly, the fly, little step, little step, attack, feint, bicycle step, splits, the fly, pas de bourré, pas de bourré! You're really starting to bug me. I'll take that as a compliment. Enough! Let's finish this. (FAST PACED BLUEGRASS MUSIC) You filthy cricket! Will you stop? Not bad. It's a shame there's no ball after all. No! Apollo! Marguerite! Run! Wendy! Please! Don't do this, you don't have to be... A wasp? Is that what you wanted to say? An outcast that cannot be trusted? Kept away from the hive? I know you've always felt rejected. I made mistakes. I learned that these last few days with the Pests. All little bugs should live together. There's still time to change. No! It's too late! The hive is mine! Wendy, no! Oh no, Apollo! Apollo! I'm all right, my Queen! Well, for the moment. All right, cricket, any last words? Dinner is served? (BAT SCREECHING) WENDY: No! Ugh! Yeah! That's my girl! Let go of me, you mangy beast! No! No, please! No! Untie me, come on, untie me. No, wait, may I? This one's mine. We have a little score to settle. We can talk about this. No, not the grand finale! Not that! (SCREAMING) (BOOMING) This is so beautiful. Yes, beautiful. (LARRY CLEARING THROAT) (REGAL MUSIC) Huh? (CROWD CHEERING) (WHISTLING) WOMAN: We love you, Queen Marguerite! Queen, we love you! Life in the garden will finally return to normal. You can rule the hive again. Well, to be frank, my loveable louse, I think that I have other plans for the near future. A nice long trip maybe? What? Really? You want to hand over the crown? Why not? I want to see the world and I want to tend to my own private garden. There's only one problem: if our beloved queen no longer wants to be queen, then who shall take her place on the throne? Oh, don't worry. I think we've already found the perfect candidate, haven't we? What? Me? (GASPING) So there we are, children. That's the story of how I became Queen. And how our beautiful garden found peace and harmony again. But, but.. But Queen Betty, what about Marguerite and Apollo? What happened to them? Hmm, that, my dear children, is another story. ♪ Oh, the sun and moon both know ♪ ♪ Such love can only grow ♪ ♪ Je vois la vie en rose ♪ ♪ And when we dance it's like flight ♪ ♪ it's like light ♪ ♪ And when she smiles I'm alive ♪ ♪ such delight ♪ ♪ Feel the magic in the air ♪ ♪ enchantment everywhere ♪ ♪ La vie en rose ♪ Subtitles by explosiveskull (LIGHT MUSIC) (FUN BLUEGRASS MUSIC) (KOOKY MUSIC) (SLOW GENTLE MUSIC) (TENSE MUSIC) (CALM AIRY MUSIC)
