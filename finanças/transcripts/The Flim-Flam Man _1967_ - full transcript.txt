Come on. Take it easy now. - Much obliged. - There. Here it is, I've been hold up here last couple nights. No, it's alright, it's alright. Yes sir, it's a mighty purdy spot lad. Yep. They're millions of people they slave there lives away, just spend a couple weeks a year, in a place like this. - Sit yourself down. - Thanks, mighty quiet little place you got here. I'll get ya some water so you can, wash up a bit. Much obliged. What a mess. Ahh, well. Oh! Mordecai Jones, is the name. My card. Mr. Jones, Curley Treadaway. Pleased to make your acquaintance Mr. Treadaway! Grateful to ya, for savin' whatever's left of me. Who you running from, lad? Who said I was on the run? Well you said you'd been hold up here, I thought we might be in the same boat. MP's is after me. I'm over the hill from Fort Bragg. MP's huh, well, in a way I kinda envy ya. Seems like half the human race is lookin' for Mordecai Jones one way or the other. - Why'd ja go over the hill? - I had to. This, big mouth Yankee sergeant, always ridin' me, makin' fun of the way I talked. I stood it as long as I could. - Ya didn't kill him, lad? - Nah, course not. But I bust his jaw. An I had ta git. Five weeks to gitin' out, an I had ta git. Headed home now, are ya? No, I already been up to the farm, had to hightail it outta there. MP's got a nervous thing, case I come back. Ain't got nobody anyway, my folks are dead. I was gonna grab that freight to Atlanta, but I couldn't tell ya why. You eat today? Nah, I just lay up here thinkin'. Kinda looks like we, birds of a feather. Couple a Ishmael. But, we'll eat. Got any money on ya? 'Bout 60 cents. Splendid! That gives us a grand total of a, two dollars, and 10 cents. We'll eat all right. Tell me about this here, Ellers Bend. They got a general store there? That's about all. Ever play any, three card money maid, Mexico's gift to grifter? I've lost a few dollars, tell ya that. Would you have any objections to, joinin' me in a little game at the local store? That's your line is it? Your card said traveling salesmen. Greens my line, not greed. Fourteen candid months, they never letcha down. Find the queen. - Try it again? - Yeah. You want me to show for ya, that's it? My pa, would of blistered my butt. I don't hold with cheatin', Mr. Jones. Only the cheaters, Curley, "Ya can't cheat a honest man". Well now, is it possible, that amongst this entire assemblage, that not a one of ya, got any confidence in his own judgment? Why, it's the easiest game ya ever seen, all ya gotta do is spot the Queen. Come on gentlemen, pick her out for a quarter. - I'll take a box of Ginger Snaps. - Pick a card, nobodies barred? Ya ain't gettin' me in that game. I've knowed people they've clean right out. Oh go on give 'em a try Gary. You're just ignorant enough to win. I ain't done this in some time. Here we go, come-on gents pick a card. - I'll go in for a quarter, ol' timer. - Ol' timer? Anything I can't stand, is some young punk not yet dry 'hind his ears, callin' me ol' timer. Put your money where your mouth is, boy. All right I'm gonna give ya the chance of a lifetime. There she is, there she be, now can ya tell me, where you see? I new it was that one! That's the one I thought it was. My, your purdy good ain't ja. There ya are. Match ya 50 cents this time, ol' timer. Oh, I fought an' bled, the ginger snap kid, here we go. And again and again. I never make any money, but I love the game. Where's the lady, pick her out for me, you got yourself a half a dollar? - He won again. - Why don't you try? - There ya are. - Play me for a dollar. No, no. You take your money and get lost buster. Come on gents, step up, who wants to pick the queen for a quarter. I'll try it for a quarter, mister. I thought you're a sportin' man, I can tell a collage educated man when I see one. There ya go, where is the Queen? They call this Three Card Monty. Up in Saint Louie they call it, tossin' the glove. Watch very closely, there she is. Boy you fellas are good around here, I tell ya. - Gary I won me a quarter! - Must be loosing your touch. Try it again. - Ya get a hunch, and ya bet a bunch. - I got 75 cents on this one right here. Here we go! Get on, get in here friend, everybody plays, and nobody pays! - What in hell? - Gary I won me again! Get along, get along, get along. You sharpen the wit, you sharpen the eye... That old guy, he's over seven dollars a head. Ya bend up the corner of that Queen. Know what I mean? If you come in with me, then we'll clean 'im out. I'll come back later and split with ya 50/50. Where is the Queen!? And we'll let her fly. There ya go. And, did you see that? He wasn't even looking, will he do it again? I'd like to examine them cards! What's that? You better be careful there sonny. I said I wanted ta have a look at them cards. I quit. Ain't that a sight! Try to have a nice wholesome, friendly little game there's always one fella comes along, tries ta call a fake. Satisfied are ya?! You comin' in Keller? My store, ain't it? I gotta make a profit on every transaction. One dollar. One Dollar! The man says the game is intriguing again. You better get all your moneys out, watch very closely Mr. proprietor, and at no time, do my arms leave my sleeves. - Where's the girl? - 50 cents. And the man wins. Hey you won! - Make it two. - Two dollars, the man stays. I tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna put 'em there, so you can pick 'em up real easy. All right gents, here we go once again. Everybody bid down, watch the card, watch the queen. Yeah. Oh, ah, after sharing the expenses, your half comes to exactly uh, 21 dollars. Profitable hour, lad. You worked that old scrooge, like a natural born shill. - You took Keller, for 42 dollars? - In deed, greedy man isn't he. It was more like 30, but one thing leads to another, and there's a healthy demand for love boatin' in Ellers Bend. And there's a unhealthy demand, for potency pills, over at the sawmill. And of course, at 3 for $5, there's always a demand for diamonds. Diamonds? There just glass! I never said they wasn't. Just signified they stolen, that's all. You can sell any thing on God's green earth, if the customer believes the story. You know um, it went so well, I was wonderin' if you might wanna, continue the partnership? Partners, me and you? Well, our experience this evening, suggests that the, territory is right for exploitation. You know the territory an' a, I know how to exploit. You mean, go looking for more suckers. Goes against my raising, Mr. Jones. Mordecai. I know it. I can see it does lad, and I appreciate it. All right. Curley, could be mutually profitable. And, could be a whole lot safer, the two of us just string along together for a spell. Question is, what have you got for a logical alternative? Yeah, That's the question, Mr. Jones. Mordecai. Five or six of 'em all around us. Come on. There they are! Don't let 'em get away! There they are, both of 'em! They was right here, I seen 'em! Stop! Stop or I'll, I'll shoot! Got 'em. Hey fellas, I got 'em! Come over here! Ooooh! I'm shot in the foot! Ya stupid lunkhead! They ain't gonna look for us in here, they'll think we kept on runnin'. You better be right. This'll do us nice, and fine. Get us a good nights sleep. Don't make any more mistakes Harv. I'll stop giving you credit at my store. They're madder than hornets, out there. We spoiled the present for 'em, I reckon. You go down the road, we go this way. Boy, I'll say one thing, you sure don't let things worry ya none. Worry? We ain't got no worries lad, we'll make out fine, just fine. I know who you are, Mordecai Jones. Your the Flim-Flam Man. Yeah, some folks call me that, sure enough. I knew, I knew that name, Mordecai Jones. Why, I've heard about you ever since I can remember. Your famous! Flim-Flam man. And you want me, for a partner? You herd the proposition lad, sleep on it. Good night, Curley. Good night, Mordecai. Now come on Mordecai, let me lug that case awhile. You and me is gonna be partners, I oughta carry half the load? No thank you, I been carrying it so long now, I, kinda need it keep my balance. Sure ain't much traffic. Now we just gotta find us some kinda personal transport. First car comes along, gives us a lift, we'll borrow it. Borrow it? How do you mean borrow it? I think, I hear somethin' now. MP's, watch it! That's a close one, lad. Them the fellas that after you? Yeah, they don't give up easy, do they? Those guys, they won't be happy 'till they got me locked up, tighter than a tick, an throwed away the key. Take it easy now, they ain't gotcha yet. Lay ya 4 to 1 they never do. You don't wanna worry, so much. Ya best get outta that army shirt though. - Yeah, that's a good idea. - Here, I'll give ya one of mine. Here, put that on. Yeah, we'll be all right. We'll get us a lift here, soon as I... Shh! Here they come! Watch it! I seen someone, duck down real fast. Couldn't be Doodle Powell, ain't enough cover for a still down there. - I sure seen someone, sheriff. - Tramp maybe, or a dog. Ya want me beat up the bushes? Oh, if it ain't Doodle, it ain't worth the effort, and it ain't. I say, he's got his still cross the river, the other side of Clayton. Come on, let's go. Curley, I don't think to much these here roads now. Seems like nobody's on 'em except, various branches of the constabulary. Next it'll probably be a G-man. They're looking for somebody's still. Somebody by the name of Doodle Powell. Ah, they lookin' for every-buddy, boy. Let's say we take a little stroll cross country, avoidin' the roads, huh? Well, we sure ain't gettin' anywheres this way. Bout now, I think one thing we need is a little, inspiration. - I tell ya ain't gonna work. - Of course it's gonna work. Nobody's gonna believe I been injured, look! All we're gonna do is have a little fun play acting. Come on. - I can't do that. - Come on now. Come on now, don't hang back. And don't forget to limp. Hello! Hello, in the house! My knee! Help someone! Help! Is anyone home? Help! Have pity! Have pity! Help! Oh please, help. Thank heavens your there! Oh please, forgive this intrusion madam, but we've had an accident. - An accident? Where? - Right along that road there. We swerved, to avoid a dog, and went right off the road and crashed. - You gotta... Crash! - Yes. Oh my goodness. You've been hurt, you have been hurt! Oh please now don't be alarmed, madam. That really isn't as bad it looks, it's really Mercurochrome, mostly on those bandages. I am the Reverend Schoolmaker, Mrs. Packard. It is Mrs. Packard, isn't it? I saw your name on the mailbox, my card. And this poor, unfortunate young man, I think you said your name was Dockerty, didn't you son, my son? - Yeah, Dockerty! - Oh, you poor, poor boy. I just knew, something awful was gonna happen when I woke up this morning. It really ain't as bad as it looks, ma'am, please don't distress yourself any. There's a brave lad, Mrs. Packard. As bad luck would have it, I had only just stopped the car to give young Dockerty here a lift, when we met with our misfortune. Oh, oh well now you please come inside, Reverend, you help. Yes, do, come inside. I swear the way people drive on these highways, well I just know I'd die. It's such a rare thing you find, this compassion. Dear Reverend, do come in, come in, sit down make yourself at home. Oh, oh you poor thing. I'll just go make some coffee then I'll call the doctor. Dear lady, I wonder if in these, distressing circumstances, you would be kind enough to loan me your car, so that I might take this poor lad to the nearest doctor? Well of course, Reverend, but it won't be necessary my daughter Bonnie Lee'll be happy to drive ya. - Please, no, surely there now Misses... - Bonnie Lee! Get up honey, there's been an accident! She wouldn't be sleeping this late, but she got home late last night from the dance, in Queen City. Bonnie Lee! Perhaps we shouldn't disturb her at all, and if you'll just trust me with your car. Momma, what's the matter? - Bonnie Lee! Honey, why didn't you put something on? - I didn't know there was anybody here. Now you run up stairs and get dressed, quick now. We've gotta drive these gentlemen into Dr. Jessup they've had a terrible accident. All right, just give me a minute. Mrs. Packard, I don't like the look of this at all, this may be a situation where every moment counts if I could just avail upon you for the loan of your automobile? No no, Reverend, I'll just hurry her up. Bonnie Lee! Bonnie Lee, honey you, hurry now! Now listen here, just what are you trying to pull? These is decent folks. I know that! I can appreciate that lad, I thought they's both very charming. Particularly the mother, she has a kinda quality, a sort of... Now listen here, "Reverend". You try any kind of crazy stuff, I'm gonna step right square in your way! Partners or no partners, I ain't about to get involved in no car theft. Believe me man, don't you trust old Mordecai? You stick with the legal... - Bonnie Lee! - Coming. Now listen honey, we're in a hurry, but you drive careful, hear? Course mom, your a mother. Reverend, Reverend, we're ready. Yes... Oh, oh my, dear, you must be in such pain? Oh no, really, I'm fine! Thank you ma'am. Oh Reverend, I am so happy that you found my house. I'm always so glad, when I can help somebody. My dear lady, I understand, and I want you to know that I appreciate so much, what you've done for the young Dockerty. - Whoa! - Oh! Oh, you all right!? Are you hurt? My, goodness sake! - Help. - I'm alright, I'm okay. I'll be okay. Aah, Miss Packard, perhaps if we could put the suitcase in the trunk. Thank you. Ah, there we are! Thank you, that's very kind. Oh, Mrs. Packard, perhaps you could be of greater service, if you were to stay behind and phone the doctor, an tell him we're on our way! You are so right, I'll do that. Now, Bonnie Lee, do be careful. - Thank you! - Of course I will, mother. You alright? Merciful heavens! Miss. Packard, I am forgetting my calling. Your mother has behaved, with the compassion, of a good Samaritan, and such behavior must not go unrewarded. I wonder if you would be so kind, as to slip in there and present her, with this special edition, of the "Sermon on the Mount". Blessed are the merciful, for they shall ah, ah, inherit the earth. Quickly my child, we must be on our way. Thank you Reverend, that's very kinda you. Mordecai, what are you tryna... Hey! I'm gettin' outta here! Mordecai! Stop this car, Mordecai! Now look, I told ya I want no parta this, now stop this car! Let me outta here! Damn you, Mordecai, I said I didn't want no part of that! - Now, you stop, this is car theft! - Hey!!! Mom!!! Let me outta this! Stop it, now! - What is it Bonnie Lee? - They drove off in the car! They stole my car! I'm gonna call daddy! Well I declare, if the clergy around here is gonna start stealing everybody's automobiles. What are you talkin' about? To walk into somebodies house, and just steal their car. Nonsense, not steelin' anything. Then whaddaya call it? Borrowin' that's all. Justa get us someplace where we can borrow another one. I'm sick 'n' tired of lookin' for Doodle Powell. I tell you Meshaw, I think Doodle knows where will be lookin' for 'im. Somebody in our office is taking a cut, for tippin' 'im the word. Ain't that Art Packard's car? His little girls car? His heads bandaged, looks like they had an accident. What they doin'? - You ever see 'em before? - No. Let's take a look. - Stay calm lad! - Let me out! Dang it! Who's that fella there? What's that fella? Police! It's the police, Mordecai! Watch it Meshaw! Well, we give 'em the slip lad. I reckon, I haven't lost the old touch. Reminds me of a time down in Tennessee. - I was in... - Listen! There comein'! Mordecai, I think we outta... Mordecai!!! Yeow! Hey! What the heck? Mordecai slow down! Look out! Mordecai stop this car before we get killed! Easy lad, I don't wanna lose control. - How ya doin'? - Be careful, watch out! Good thing we haven't been drinking lad! Mordecai your crazy! Stop! Stop! Halt! I think maybe the worst is over. Halt! Halt! Shoot them tires! Awww, come on Meshaw! Now, come on now, pull it out. Don't just bend it! - Look out! - There he is! There they go! Meshaw watch it! Hey! Help, let me down! Hope that gentleman wasn't injured. Hey, what's the matter with you? You crazy or somethin'? Hey you! That's it, I give up. Hey, that's Bonnie Lee's car! Let, me, out, of, here! Meshaw! That's my daughters car! They stole that car! We're after them, Mr. Packard, we'll catch 'em. There two of um, they stole one car of mine and used it to wreck the other! Well, we ain't got a chance of getting through here, better back up, go round the other way! Meshaw! Come on, we gotta back up! Wait a minute Slade, I'm comin' with ya. All right, jump in Mr. Packard. Let's go Meshaw. What we did to that poor town! Yep. I'd say, they remember us in Clayton, lad. There comin'. Catch us now, there gonna hang us! Mordecai? Mordecai? Mordecai. Mordecai. Mordecai? Mordecai? You're all right, lad? Yeah. Suitcase. Suitcase. Curley, this way. Aww. Aww, look what they did. Look at this car! - We'll get 'em, Mr. Packard. - Sheriff! Huh! Aah! Aaaahh! The saints be praised we found ya, sir. It is, Mr. Powell, is it not? You don't know us Doodle, but ah, we're your friends, and we come to warn ya, man. There! Over there, look! It's the police! They're right behind us! Hurry, you may have a chance! It's too late Doodle, there right behind ya! Wait a minute! No you don't. You've done enough for one day. Let me drive. What's the matter, Don't you trust me? Jump in. It's Doodle's still! I knew I smelled stump hole! A-haa Meshaw, we found 'im! Listen, you hear that? That's Doodle, gettin' away! Come on, back to the car! We'll head 'im off, before he gets to the road. Wait a minute Slade, I don't care about Doodle Powell. What about the two that wrecked my car?! Which way partner, left or right? - I don't know, your guess. - How 'bout straight ahead? Doodle's gotta come out this-a-way! Meshaw! Listen! That's Doodle! We got 'im! This old sawmill road don't go nowhere, only leeds down to the tracks. He can't even get out of here. We got 'im! I gotta call Smitty. - Now look here, Slade. - Just a minute, Mr. Packard. - How long, Al? - Libby... We gotta catch those two car thieves. Oh, we'll get there, Mr. Packard, but this here is a federal offense, that'll take precedings. I'm callin' up some reinforcements. Old Doodle'll shoot when he's cornered. And we sure got 'im cornered. Libby, this here Slade, got some good news. Hey, look at the radio he's got in this thing. Doodle Powell, found his still and we've got 'im cornered. He's on that old sawmill road, that leeds down to the tracks, by the river. It's the police! He's got no way out of there, 'cept right past us. Now get hold of Smitty, in car 3. I want five more men right away. Tell them to bring tear gas, shotguns, and plenty-a ammo. Mighty purdy spot. You in the mood for a swim, Mordecai? Imagine that old moonshiner havein' a shortwave plugged right in the sheriff's office. Mordecai, I don't wantja to think I'm impatient, but we gotta get outta here. There's no rush lad. There still waitin' on Smitty, with the tear gas. You know, could use this here truck. Someway I could figure out... Might work, been a long time since I done it. I say it worth a try. Tell ya what we'll do. Let the air outta the tires all the way around, half pressure. In the meantime, we'll sample some of, ol' Doodle's wares. Lacquer! Why that'd curl your tongue. It's regular panther juice. Old Doodle may be a, operator, but he's no distiller of gentlemen's whiskey. We could sneak up on 'im sheriff. I could sneak thru the trees, you go up the path here... No! We'll just wait for the tear gas, that's what we'll do. Okay, now ease-er back Mordecai. Back, little bit to your right. That's it, little bit to the right. That's it. Whoa! Hey! Whaddaya tryna do? I said, take it easy! All right, now try it again. Easy. Easy. Easy. Wo, whoa! There on! Now if we could only get the front one's on. Okay, bring it forward now. That car was less than two months old. Only made two payments. Did I sign that insurance thing? Ya did it! All aboard partner. Mordecai, you're a genius. Ain't we goin' to fast? Yeah, speed is of the essence when one is, forgive the pun, makin' tracks. That's a lesson I learned during my carnival, err, my tent show days. I must say it proved tried n' true during the times I pinhooked tobacco, an' sold patent medicine. Yes sir, always comes a time for a hasty migration. Study, the birds lad. They know when to fly. Here we are, two of us, yesterday we're alone, today we both got somebody we can depend on. It's the whole principle of partnership. Help each other through a tight spot, ya know what I mean? That's it partner. I'd say we run smack into a streak of good luck. Good luck? We wrecked a car, we wrecked a town, this trucks stole, and the law's on our tail. You can't let life getcha down lad, you've got to stand up to her in the hind leg. Now, here we are on a lovely September morning, beautiful countryside, free. Our own masters, an all the things, on our side. Partner, I tell ya things are gettin' brighter. As I look ahead to the prospects, I can see the multicolored arch of the rainbow of good fortune. - And a pot a gold sittin' there. - WHOA!! Curley, don't jump boy! Now that was to close. Mordecai! I just had the brilliance of a brain storm. Tell ya what. First chance we get, remind me to pickup two, three good bottles of, barley bourbon. Just a little investment. I'll explain about it later. Doodle was here! I tell ya he was here! An' I know, how he got away. He's got one of them there amphibious vehicles. Yeah! He drove, right straight across the river. Doodle! I know you over there! An' I'm gonna getcha too! You hear me, Doodle! I'll get you the last thing I ever do, Doodle! Damn! Hello. Hello, K L 5 double 7. Don't hang up. Who's there? Oh, Rosco, is that you Rosco? Listen, when I tell ya who it is, don't hang up. - Wait a minute, is this who I think it is? - Yes, but listen, don't hang up. - Did they find your car? - Yes, they did. Well, what I called ja up about, and please don't hang up. What I called ja up about, is about the damage we did. Cause I'm gonna pay for it, you see. Only not right away. You wanna pay for the damage on both cars? Both cars? It was daddy, that you ran into in Clayton. It wasn't a new Dodge was it? A new Dodge sedan? It certainly was. Well, ah, look Rosco, I gotta hang up now. Bye. I'm afraid, that comes to, $136.40, includin' the tax. Is that right? You're sure, you haven't made, a mistake? Hmm. That seems more, than reasonable to me. You must remind me Johnson, from now on, we will do all of our shopping, here. My dear sir, you have been so, very helpful. I wonder if I might, have just 10 minutes, and to ask for a piece of, personal advise? Strictly in confidence, you understand. But we have just come into possession, - of the most extra ordinary... - Professor! Hmm? Ah, yes. Perhaps if we just, step outside a moment. Hmm. I did not wish to speak inside, in case we were overheard. I will tell you our problem. This truck, is full, loaded full, with whiskey. 58 jars of it, and so we have a little, disposal problem. Whiskey? You mean you got a, truckload of white lightning? Not so loud, please. I would, appreciate your opinion, sir. I am no connoisseur of, 'stump hole'. But this stuff, this is not your ordinary stuff. Here, sniff, test it. If you would be willing to sample it sir, and give us, the benefit of your opinion. Well I never tasted anything like... It may be the best I've... Umm. Well now look, maybe we can... You say you've got, how many jars of this? 58, including the one, which you are holding. 58, well I'll tell ya. I'll give you, two dollars a jar. - Two? - For the whole lot of 'um. Well, that sounds reasonable to me. A, Johnson? Good, I'll have my boys unload the truck. No! - What, what did you say? - I know where I can get $3 for sure. $3! Well, that's purty steep, for plain ordinary white lightnin'. That stuffs a bargain at $3 and you know it. Professor, give the man his advice fee, and lets get outta of here. Alright, alright, I'll meet that figure, $3 a jar. Probably is the best ever. 58, jars. 3, that makes $174, I will count them, you understand. - I'll just take your bill off that. - Yes. I owe you, $37.60. - Isn't that right? - Oh you, figure to rapidly, for me to follow you. I'll get your change. Here's your receipt, Professor. Curley. That was brilliant! You have a neat touch, and a superb sense of timing, partner. You're a natural. Got to admit it Mordecai, I feel a whole heep better than I did this time last night. Course, I'm not any easier in my mind. Oh man, just hope my pa ain't somewhere lookin' at me. I mean, I hope he's somewhere all right, but not just lookin' at me 'n' you. Well, you'll be easier on your mind, when you get yourself a belt full of Benjamin Franklin. What's he on? Well, all the hundred dollar bills, lad! Ya gotta, have money to make money. Yeah. - I'de like me a belt full of them all right. - That's the proper spirit. You play the short con, till we, get ourself a bank roll. Ya know when I was talkin' on the phone to the Packard girl? Somebody must've come in there. So she said, "Is that you Rosco"? - Just to cover up for me. - Hey lad, we got it made. Not a soul for a mile around. Four, five towns within easy striking distance. And with our Di-rect line to police headquarters, we can't miss. Not unless, you do something foolish. Curley? Hmm? Yeah! Yeah. I, recon that little beauty shook you up some, huh? Not that I blame ya, ya understand. 'Bout the prettiest little thing I ever seen. Which remind... the charming little creature I knew in, Webb City, Mizooruh. 'Bout a hundred years ago. Name of Grasha. Always loved that name. Only girl I ever knew with purple eyes. Care for a another piece of Boston Cream pie, lad? I'll get it, Mom! I've got it. Hello? Celeste, breathe hunny. She didn't. She did! Terrible. Therefore, you you, you... Now you were there? Oh you were there, I see. Well, I know she's gonna cry for me. Hey! You doin' here? You haven't got much sense, have ya? How do you know I'm not gonna call for my daddy? That's just one of the chances I'm takin'? Whaddya want? I just wanted to tell ya, all what I owe ya, I mean all what I owe your pa, - for the damage we done, I'm gonna pay it back. - Don't talk so loud. I'm just gonna need a little time, that's all. You told me all that on the phone. Didn't need to come up here tell me that? What'd ja come here for? Well, listen I... I got a truck hid up the road, wanna go for a ride? Takin' an awful lot for granted, Jason Treadaway. - How'd ja find out my name? - Sheriff Slade was here, and his deputy. They had your picture from the U.S. Army. And they have that old mans, from when he was in prison, with a number on it. He's your partner isn't he? Listen. I'm on the run from the army, that's all. And Mordecai, well we met accidental. He's... I'm on the run too, I guess. Hey, could you tell you're folks somethin'? Ya know, make up some kinda story, and meet me somewhere just so we can umm, umm... So we can what? And what for? I better get back inside... Not so fast, Jason. Not Jason, Curley. Bonnie Lee? Bonnie Lee, you out here? Bonnie Lee, where are you? Yes, daddy! I'll phone you. - What were you doin' out there? - Why nothin' daddy. It's a hot night, 'n'... I'z just gettin' some air. Seven from the left, five from the top. Nine from the right, six from the top. Twelve from the bottom, no, twelve from the right. Three from the bottom. Seven from the... Seven from the left, five from the top. Nine from the right, six from the top. These here boards, is against the law now. Captain Lovick, you've got me there, and I don't deny it. But as you well know sir, there are laws, and, there are laws. And when you consider the profit margin, that can be gained from a little, harmless entertainment. What'd you say the figures was? You pay a dollar for the board, I take my profit out of the sale. Then ya lay out 20 more, two 5's, and a grand prize of 10. But, ya take in $50. I know it's a gamble, and I don't deny it. But what can you name me now a days, that doesn't involve a risk? Man in your position got to stir around a little, in these times of high taxes if ya expect to turn a tidy profit. Tell ya what I'll do. You pay me a dollar, I'll bet you that dollar, against a doughnut, you can take that young hick over there, for the price of the board. From then on, your consummately, in the green. Maybe I will at that. I'll just take these dungarees. Hey can I have a, chance at that punch thing? You got a dime, I reckon you can. Oh, here's a punch. You got any more of these, punch board things? Unfortunately, they going so well, that's the last one I had on hand. And I'm starting a regular route, through here, and I shall return Tuesday week. Put me down for two more, ahh no, three more. And, thanks. Colonel, good day. Don't nobody ever win in this here thing? Now, I stand behind everything, in this store. Looks like my lucks come back. I done hit for $5. Huh, now, let me see that. Yeah, hey, hey hey, you, you you lucky, boy. Five dollars. Now, you ain't quitin' now, are ya? Try again, try again? Well. Still got, two more punches on my dollar. - I'm gonna try, two more. - That's my boy. Go ahead on, go ahead, go ahead. Hey! Hey! Both of 'em! I dun hit both of 'em! - Both of what? - A five, - and a ten. - Lemme see that. That's the darndest thing! Looks like I come up smelling roses, this time mister. Just somethin' around here, just don't smell right. Are you gonna pay me my winnin's, or am I gonna call the police? - Where's the phone? - No, no. Five, and ten. Like ta play ya some more, but there ain't no more prizes. You know you could put this earth in a bottle and mail it to me halfway around the world and I'd recognize it. I know the feel of it. There's somethin' about land, when you own it. We got a natural spring. And there's that lake on the south side. All I need is a new tractor. A little time, an' work, an' I could make this into a real showplace. Right here, ma used to have her prized rose bushes. Yeah, it's all over grown now. First thing I'm gonna do is clear this all out. Tobacco, corn, and kids, is the principal crop in this county. Whaddaya think of my house? If you squint your eyes, you can see what it use to be. Front part's over 80 years old. Back part was added on. Pa did it all by himself. Hey, you know what else I'm gonna get? I'm gonna get me some Banty hens. And a couple of ponies. Some good hounds. - And peacocks! - Peacocks? Yeah, there a mean bird, but fascinatin'. Oh Curley, this is just crazy, I mean the whole thing. Sneekin' off to meet ja. Telling lies to my folks, and ridin' around in a truck you stole. Now you're dreamin' about peacocks. Whole things just plain crazy. And that awful old man. - He's not an awful old man. - He's a horrible old man. And if you go on doin', whatcha doin', your gonna end up just exactly like him. Jason, I wantcha to do somethin' for me. I wantcha to go see sheriff Slade, right now, and tell him the truth. The whole thing was just an accident. That's not the truth. Well then it was just one big mistake. I know he'll listen, and he'll understand. And you can tell him that, you never even meant to get yourself involved with Mordecai Jones. And then, you can explain to the army, just exactly why you had, to hit that Yankee sergeant. They'll just have to believe you. Gonna talk about, corn, an tobacco, and kids. Gotta make some kinda sense. Well, that's the whole point Curley, the world is full of 'em. Ours is avaricious society. - What's that word mean? - Avaricious? Just, fancy for greed. Everybody's not like that. Matter of degree. Every thermometer gotta register somethin'. What about you Mordecai? Me? I was, idealistic as they come. More so than most. But, it didn't take me long to appreciate what really makes the world go round. Contrary to what Paul says, it ain't love. And when I learnt that, done somethin' to me. I commence ta, turn inside on myself, starvin' an' then, couldn't enjoy nothin'. Got mean. Terrible thing. Terrible. But, one day, it come to me. Everybody so determined to be, greedy, and to bein' ignorant. Maybe what they need was a little, liberalized education. So in order to teach 'em, I, qualified myself with a honorary degree. Mordecai Jones, M. B. S. C. S. D. D. What does all that mean? Master of Back Stabbin', Cork Screwin', and Dirty Deeds. Ours is a, society of goods and services. I think I'm performin' a service. Cause after meetin' up with me, maybe they ain't so eager for the edge next time. Son, you'd be amazed at the hundreds of satisfied students, I have matriculated over the last fifty years. Lad. Look at that one. A belt full of tobacco money, an' a belly full of beer. That's our mark, son. Hold on there, I seen it first. - I saw that. - Maybe you did, but I got it. - And possessions is 9/10's of the law. - Possession, my, foot. I saw that wallet before you did and it's, rightfully mine. You listen to me old timer. I've got it, and I ain't gonna be givin' it to you. You ain't gonna do anything else, boy. You young smart aleck you. Now, I'm warning you for the last time. You hand that over to me 'r... Pardon me, gentlemen. Forgive my intruding, but I saw, the whole incident, from right over there across the street there. - What's it gotta do with you? - Well, that remains to be seen, sir. But unless you are trying, to attract, the police, I suggest, that the three of us can settle this little dispute, amicably, like gentlemen. Wait a minute. The three of us? Now just where do you come in? Well, we all three, saw the wallet young fella. Any one of us could holler for the law, might collect a handsome reward too. Ahh but, I suggest, that we get to some place a little less conspicuous, before the, owner comes back. Hail that. - Maybe your talking some sense mister. - Shall we? - Here, you better hold that. - Well, if you wish. My friends, we have struck it. There's exactly, 1600 dollars in cash here, and a check for another thousand. Hot damn! - Hot diggity damn! - Hey, there's a name in there, ain't there? - Oates, Mr. Titus Oates. - That's an awful lot of money. Maybe we oughta try an locate the owner, and settle for a reward. Hell fire, boy. I ain't about to go huntin' for no owner. Why, it's losers weepers, finder's keepers, where I come from. What are you suggesting sir? A simple three way split? Because if you are, I, suggest we try, cashing the check. - I don't know, that's pretty dangerous, I wouldn't... - I wouldn't risk it. To many people know me. I just sold my, tobacco crop, up at the auction there. As the only one of us who's a stranger in town, I, might, risk it. - Thousand dollars. - Nah. Hold on now. Maybe ahh, maybe you oughta... All right. I'll try. But now, see here. I think I oughta see a little somethin' from you two, if I'm gonna risk goin' into that bank? How much, mister? 500? You holdin' that much, ain'tcha? Tell ya what, you two put 500 in here, I'll go to the bank, ahh, that'll make, if I get the thousand, 36-hundred, that'll be, 1200 dollars for each of us, that seem reasonable to ya? - Hell no! - Sounds pretty fair to me. Let's see now, 50, 100, two, three, five! - But we keep the wallet right here. - Yeah, that's right. That way we don't run no risk, of him skedaddlin' on us. Bah, That don't worry me none, sonny. You two, stick here, you can keep an eye on each other for me. All right. Here. Hey! - Who's that over there? - Where, where? I thought I seen a policeman. No, I don't think it's nobody. - Now, who's going to hold the wallet? - I will I'll hold it. Hot damn! Hot diggity damn! I don't know, he's been gone over 30 minutes now. I think we oughta go look for 'im. That's a good idea. I think we better go look fer... Wait a minute. Maybe I oughta wait here. Case he comes back the other way. But it wouldn't hurt for you to go look for him. You know, I wouldn't trust one of them city slickers, any further than I could spit against a hurricane. Curley, glad ja got back early. Look here! Atlanta. Atlanta is the target, son. There she is, that's a good chewin' town. The big carnies, like a piece of cherry pie, in Atlanta. Start gettin' packed, huh. - I ain't goin' to Atlanta. - Whaddaya say? I'm gonna wait a couple days, so you can get away. Then I'm gonna give myself up. You're gonna do what? You heard me, Mordecai. I gonna give myself up. I'm curious, being a element of my nature, just what it is, your gonna give yourself up to, son? A flash in the pan passion, for some little gal? - It ain't just her. - It never is, just a woman, son. I ain't your son, Mordecai! Excuse me. Alright, tomorrow mornin', we'll cut up the catch. - I don't want no part of it. - You better take it, boy. Out of this frying pan, into that fire, your gonna find a lawyer, standin' there with his hand open. That $700 could be very helpful to ya. I don't want no part of it! I've done nothin' to earn it! Why? Cause you didn't do no honest work? Is that it? Yeah, somethin' like that! And ya expect, if ya turn your back on it, the golden mantle of honor, is gonna come floatin' down outta heaven, and settle on your shoulders! I ain't that stupid. It's just that lately I ba... I've been wondering if there's such a thing left in this whole world, as one plain honest man! I'da said that I was, and I know I ain't. I said, most peoples honest enough. But every single time, you'd show me what they was really like. Mordecai, I gotta believe in somethin'. Somethin' better than greed. What you really mean is, you wanna settle down, huh. I don't wanna run no more! You wanna break your sentimental back on some piece of dead ground? I don't wanna end up like you! Good morning. Hold it there! That's it then, hold-er steady, maybe we can take you alive, huh. Raise 'em up. Congratulations sir, a most unexpected displeasure. How'd you happenta stumble in here, at this hour of the morn? Why that was easy Mr. Flim-Flam, little Miss Packard. Her pa got sort of suspicious. So we watched her. She led us to him, he led us to you. We've been here quite a spell now, cause a ugly old man like you, we didn't wanna disturb your beauty sleep. Just get up real slow. Keep your hands up. Keep 'im covered, men. Both a you, step out there in the middle. Looks like they got us, Mordecai. Might as, well go quietly! Run Mordecai, run! Meshaw! Smitty, grab 'im! Run Mordecai! - Run Mordecai, run! - Get in there Woody, grab hold of 'im! Sheriff, guess it's, just as well for you fellas he, did decide to go quietly. Take us 24 hours, at least, just to prepare the charges. Now I ain't lettin' nobody see 'im, 'til after he's appeared in court. And aah, that ain't gonna be till tomorrow mornin'. But you want somethin' more for a quote. You can quote me, that Mr. Mordecai Jones, has pulled the last pitch he'll ever pull, in Cape Fear county. * I'll get another one prettier than you. * * I'll get another one prettier than you. * He even scratched himself, shoot 'im. That's what the sheriff said. Hey! Cuhmeer a minute, will ya? Whadda you want, Treadaway? Sheriff Slade, Get 'im up here, I got somethin' to tell 'im. Anything you got to tell him, you can tell me. You get Slade, up here, it's real important, Get 'im. He's just an old con man huh? Why sheriff, that mans a killer, a kidnapper. Why last year, down in Georgia, there was this old woman, 83 years old. I'm gettin' sick justta think about it. Well go ahead on boy, keep talkin'. Well, first, he takes all their money, see. But then, just for the fun of it, he... - Yeah? - What'd he do? I don't like talkin' with him down there. He's gonna get me sheriff. Nope, we ain't movein' Jones. I can't do no talkin' here. All right Meshaw, open up, let's bring 'im down stairs. Well, get your gun out! Keep it on 'im, every second! One false move, don't wait, just blast 'im. Maybe you've finally seen some sense boy, bout time. Yes, sir. There he is. Look at him! - Look at the great Mr. Flim-Flam man now! - Come on, boy. I told ya they'd getcha, and they did! There gonna hang you so high, cause I'm gonna tell 'em all, ya hear? - Here, gimme your gun, I'll kill 'im myself! - Come on, not now! Ahh, don't listen to him sheriff, he's a liar! Wait, wait till I tell 'em about that poor old women in Georgia, and what he did to her. Curley, no, not that. Curley! Sheriff, don't believe 'im, I swear! I don't even know what he's talkin' about! Sheriff! Curley, I'll get you! I'll get you, you double-crossing little, I'll... - Let me Get 'im! Let me... - Come on, let's go. Now, listen. - Your gonna hang! I'm gonna tell 'em everything! - Let's go, come on Jeff. Ya hear! I'll tell them everything! Your gonna hang, Mordecai! - Smitty, I don't wanna be disturbed by nobody! - Alright, Chief. That's alright, folks. We'll letcha know what's happening in here. Sheriff wants everybody outta here, go on folks. Just move on, everything's under control on that. Just go about your business. - Go on, folks. Move along, that's it. - Move along now. That's five capital crimes, every one of 'em, carryin' the maximum. Wait'll them city boys, hear how we've been doin' their job for 'em. Go ahead on Treadaway, what'd he do after he buried the old couple down in Savannah? I'm tryin' to remember. Oh, yeah. Well then he stole this car, you see, come from some nuns. An he come up through, Greenville, and Spartinberg, workin' the, money box, and the pocket book checks. But then, just outside of Charlotte, we were staying in this here, motel, and they, had a family there, I think they were from Columbia. And they had... Sheriff, this is gonna make ya sick to your stomach, but I just gotta tell it to ya to get it off my mind. They had this pretty little girl, only 9 years old... Get them outta here, Meshaw. Go on, boy. Well, he made friends with them, see. And then one night, they wanted to go to a drive-in movie. And they asked him... - Sheriff, I'm dry, my throat feels like... - Get him some water, Meshaw! - You wouldn't have any soda pop, would ya? - Get him a Pepsi, from that machine out there. Thank you sheriff. I sure appreciate your generosity to me. Now, where was I? Drive-in movie, 9 year-old girl. Oh, yeah. Well, when I tell ya what happened next, sheriff, your just gonna be stunned. - Your gonna be stunned. - That's alright, boy, you... Hey! Hey, stop! Cuhmeer! Halt! - Halt! - Meesh, knock it off! Get in the car, get after him! Do it son, do it! You all right, sheriff? - Oh my! - Git this off 'im! Didja kill 'im? - I winged him. - Well don't just stand there, get after 'im. The continuing story, of Payton Place. Hey. Why did ja do it? I had to. They told my daddy, you almost kill the sheriff. It wasn't that bad. - How can I believe you any more about anything? - I have to get Mordecai out of that jail! They'll kill you. It's only because of me they got 'im in there. Curley, go back! - I don't understand? - Don't you see! If I don't Get 'im out of there right now, he'll never get out again as long as he lives. - You don't owe him a thing. - I owe him, Bonnie Lee. I owe him. We been partners, and that means something special to Mordecai, and me both. I can't help it! I can't help what I feel about that old man, any more than I can help what I feel about you. He'd try to get me out, I know he would. I've got to think, the way he'd think. Think of what he'd do. I'm goin' to get him outta that jail, even if I hafta... Even if I hafta... If you hafta what? Curley! Good night, Judge. Good night. Anything new on that, Treadaway boy? Nah, we'll catch 'im, he can't a gone far. - Well, good night. - Good night, Uncle Charlie. Hey sheriff! What's that? Slade! Get your fat old rump out here! Who the hell is that? I want to you! The Treadaway kid. He's got the place wired. - That's dynamite! - Go for that pea shooter! - See what happens! - Hold it, hold it. Come on, make a move! Now look here boy, whaddaya think you're doin'? I'm just waitin' to see what happens when I press down this plunger. Hold it, I mean it. Now look here, Treadaway. Mister, Treadaway! Well, Mr. Treadaway. Do you know what you're doin'? I sure as hell know what I'm gonna do, if I don't see my partner outside here, inside of 60 seconds. Quiet boy, don't get excited. Meshaw, get Jones, get 'im out here. Mister, Jones! That's right, bring Mr. Jones out. Now don't try nothin' smart, Meshaw, that there is an order. Nobody does nothin' fancy, I mean nobody does nothin'! Wait a minute! - Who else is in there? - Ahh, just Smitty and Mac there guardin', watching Mr. Jones. - Well, git them out here! - You heard 'im, get 'im out here! We got here too late. I'm disappointed in you, sheriff. I thought for sure, we was gonna see some action! We ain't gonna make no trouble, nothing doin', you want for us take our guns off, you just say the word. Nah, sheriff, I ain't afraid of them puny 38's. Say, is it all right if I, warn those folks justa step back there a little. Yeah, sure that's okay, sheriff. Ahh folks, will ya just step back there a little please? Just, move back, a little folks. We got a kind of a, situa... situation here. Just move back a little. - Get his his clothes! - You heard 'im, Meshaw, get 'em! And the money he was carryin'! Belong to Mr. Jones, here. Get it Meshaw, in the safe, in my office. I don't like goin' back in there. He's liable to blow the place, that kids crazy. If you don't move, I'm gonna show ya how crazy I am. And don't forget the suitcase. He needs it to keep his balance with. Git it. How are you, son? Okay, I guess. I figure you change your mind, once you got a tasta, gray-rock hotel there. Yeah. Hand those things to Mr. Jones there, hand 'em real, careful. Sheriff! I want the keys to that car, right over there. Well that's my own car! Give 'em the key to my car, like he says. I called the state police, every road out of town, be blocked in 5 minutes. We're doin' pretty good son, we... We got us a car, and we, got a key, but, just one thing, we ain't gonna get a mile, before every cop in the state gonna be lookin' for us! We won't, but you will. I ain't going nowhere. - What are you talking about? - I run my last step ever, from anybody! Now, listen. Go fast, get clear out of the county, across the state line. I don't know how long I can hold 'em. Now you see that phone over there? Here's the number. When you know your okay, let-er ring three times. Now, you'd better get goin'. - Curley, I can't go without you. - You're on your own now, old man! Old man? Why I'll dance on your grave, ya young one. Reckon ya might. Now come on Mordecai, get goin'. Well now Sheriff, I reckon everything'll be all right. Just as soon as I hear on that telephone, that Mr. Jones, is safe. You were right, Bonnie Lee. I toldja Curly, wouldn't run. He's gonna hafta pay somethin', for what he did. He knows that. Well, I'll see he gets treated fair, good lawyer an' all. I promise you that. Thank you daddy. Hey, get back there! Now come on, please stay out of this area! Look here, Mr. Treadaway, lets stop all this foolishness. Your friend ain't exactly old mister reliable, you know.
