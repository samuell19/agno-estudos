♪ Uh-oh, here come the holidays again ♪ ♪ Uh-oh, these over-crowded shopping malls ♪ ♪ Uh-oh, here come the holidays again ♪ ♪ Uh-oh Hey, hey, hey. Merry Christmas besties. It's your girl, Maya Way or the Highway here, and I'm about to tell you what's up. Okay, so I'm in Portland trying to get to Denver to spend Christmas with my parents. And it is a mess. I mean, there are storms somewhere. And it's messing things up everywhere. Now, weather is not my thing, obvi, so I rely on the experts and the people on TikTok are saying it's epic, but in a bad way. I know that's confusing 'cause your girl Maya typically uses epic as a positive. But in this case it is bad. And to make things worse, the wifi here is next-level terrible. - Can you do whatever it is you're doing somewhere else? - Are you like for real right now? Do you like wanna find out? Okay. So I apologize for that photo bomb of negative energy. Let's just say some people handle the stress of holiday travel better than others. I'll tell you what helps me though, a homemade holiday bomb that I'm cooking up for y'all. Part of the soon-to-be-released My Way Home Collection. Oh, hints of nutmeg and evergreen. It smells like Christmas and it feels like home. Sorry, just talking about home reminds me of how bad I wanna get there. And I just, I, I just... Um, excuse me. Hi, you're, you're in my frame. - No, what I'm in is a public airport. But you could be anywhere in a public airport, right? - Not if I want to check the status of my flight to Denver. - O-M-G, I'm going to Denver. - Well, this day just keeps getting better. So what's the deal? - If you're referring to the flight, doesn't look good. - You know, I've got this radical lens on humanity and I'm sensing you're a glass-half-empty type. No judgment. Can I stop you right there? All I really care about right now is getting to Denver for Christmas. Okay. - Excuse me, sir. We are traveling from Hong Kong. We are going here. - Denver. - Yes. Well, the weather's bad. My advice, if you don't need to travel, don't. Thank you. Thank you. - Did you hear what he just said? If you don't have to travel today, don't. - Oh, is he a part of the airline. I don't think so. - Oh, then it's just another traveler's opinion. - His luggage had diamond tags on it. He must know something. - Mom, if you don't want to spend the holidays in Denver, just say something. What? Honey, this whole thing was my idea. Of course. I wanna go. - Well then maybe you could start acting like it. - Okay, I'm concerned about the weather, Ben. I can't just turn off being a mother. - All right, I'll go get some snacks. Get me a slice of pizza. - Few things harder than raising a teenager. Tell me about it. Do you have a teen? No, but I was a terrible one. Oh. - But I do have a really great relationship with my parents now So there is light at the end of the tunnel. Oh, that's a relief. Are you going to see them for the holiday? - No, I'm headed to Colorado to snowboard. Oh. - Once-in-a-hundred-year storm. First tracks if I get there by Christmas day. Hope you make it. - Where there's a will, there's a way. Oh, excuse me. Uh, hey, are you there? How's the snow? Nope. No, that's not it. It's double shot, no foam candy cane cappuccino. - Oh, so you mean a candy cane latte? No, I don't mean a latte. Because lattes have no foam. Yeah, no, I know that. But they also have more milk. - Oh, but you said you didn't want milk. - Actually said I wanted oat milk. - Well, that doesn't foam up anyways, so. - Yeah, as of now, the flight is still on so I'll be there. That is, if this guy ahead of me can finish ordering his candy cane Chad-uccino. Chad-uccino, really? Lemme call you back. Sorry, it's just a playful little term, you know, for a, a complicated coffee order. Yeah, yeah. No, I know it. I just don't typically hear it from, you know, an adult. Sorry, where were we? Let me think. Nowhere. - You know what, just for the record, my order is not that complicated. It's not that complicated, right? - Employee handbook says I can't answer that. Okay, even if it was, nothing wrong with saying what I want. - Nothing wrong at all. - No Actual data does suggests the biggest blockage in healthy communication actually comes from people who don't say what they want. - Makes perfect sense. - Yeah. - And as that's clearly not an issue for you, maybe you could do us all a favor and just hurry it along. - Everything's delayed. What's the rush? There's no rush. I just think a little common courtesy during this busy holiday travel season would be much appreciated by all. - Says the lady who called me a Chad. - Okay. I suggested that your order was typical of a Chad. I didn't call you a Chad. - Okay. And now we're splitting hairs. Okay. Okay. How about this? What I want is for you to please finish your order so that everyone behind you in line can go on with their holiday. How's that for healthy communication? Attention, all travelers. Status for flight 554 to Denver will be updated momentarily. Please check the departure boards near you. So where were we? - No. - Oh, no. Unbelievable. Well, it's your lucky day. Yeah? How's that? You were seated next to me. Worst Christmas ever. Attention passengers, flight number UA1480 to Chicago scheduled to depart from Gate 47- Hey! Hey again. I'm Dana, by the way. So I'm thinking we're all headed to Denver, right? How about we all share a rental car? I mean, between the three of us, we could drive straight through, be there by Christmas Eve. Oh, thank you. Yeah, I'm thinking we'll try to get on a flight tomorrow. Good luck with that. Three flights to Denver already got canceled, so I'm in. Okay. We're in too. - Honey, I'd like us to consider all our options. Well, you heard him. There's no chance we're getting on another flight, so. He's Diamond. He must know, right? Okay, we're in. You drive? To Denver? - They're trying to get to the same place. - Sure, no problem. - Thank you. Okay, so that's six of us. We'll get an SUV. - Excuse me, I'm Ember. I overheard your plans. Look, I can't pay much, but I'm a night owl so I could take the late shift no problem. - Fine. Still an SUV, but that's it. - Let's go. - Okay. Um, guys. What about me? Let's hustle people. We're gonna need to divide and conquer to cover every company. I think I have a coupon for 20% off my next car rental. It's only for compact. I get a little car sick so I just need to keep my window open. Are you both aware it's winter? Let's pick it up. A lot of people probably doing the same thing we are. You in the back, can you please pick it up? - Okay, so I don't know that one's name yet, but that one's being a little extra. I mean, where's the Christmas spirit? Stop right there. Whatever it is you're about to ask, my answer is no. Just, keep walking buddy. Yeah. - And Merry Christmas. - He's very scary. - All the other rental car companies are sold out. - I saw one group that found an Uber to take them to Pittsburgh. I can't even imagine what that would cost. That's okay. We're next. Everything should be fine. Hey, hey! Wait till I call you, please. But I'm next. - I have a Platinum member I have to help first. - Promise to, um, how'd you put it? Hurry it along. - How you doing? - You know that guy? Not well. Yeah, what? What? W- Okay. Sorry folks. There's only one vehicle left and it's going to this guy. It's a lot to handle. Probably not what you had in mind but... Whatever it is, I'll take it. Thank you. See? Real fast. - Why are you still standing here? - We could get a hotel. Hunker down for the night. Maybe, maybe they'll have more cars tomorrow. - Ah, checked every hotel. There's nothing available. Oh. Hey, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Are you nuts? What the... Seriously? You're gonna drive this thing to Denver on your own? - If the alternative is driving with you, then yes. - Okay. Clearly we got off to a rough start. - Oh, no. Rough start implies the beginning of something. - Well, let's not get caught up in semantics. I'm not caught up in anything. Okay, I just want to hit the road. Okay? Okay, listen, I, I admit that sometimes I say more than I should and I'm sorry. Wow. - Was that hard? - What? - What? That apology - A little. - Hmm. - Um, so I'm Dana. - Chad. - Oh, wow. It's actually. Okay. So that's why you took it so hard. I'm kidding. It's Clay. I- by the way, I, I didn't take it so hard. - You kind of did. - And there you go again. Saying more than you should. Okay, listen. - You have this very large van with a lot of empty seats. And I have a group of people who could not only fill those seats, but also help you drive because Denver, it's a, it's a long way. Fine. Yeah, I'll take them. Thank goodness. But not me? - Maybe next time you think twice before you're so judgmental on someone else's coffee order. - Or maybe you'll think twice about complicating your order when there's a very long line. I'll have my friends load up. - Great. Finally on the same page. All aboard, everybody. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. You really don't need to help. - Some of us still have Christmas spirit. - Okay, look, this stuff is not gonna stay. - Well, not packing like that it won't. - What, you think you'd do better? You set a pretty low bar. What was I thinking. Honey, what you have in your hand? Mom, stop it. - Do I have your permission to film you? - We agree. - Yay! Do I have your...? I'll assume that's a yes on permission. - We're in. - Oh. Hey, you know what I just wanted to say, you are fantastic. Aw, sweet. So do you follow my TikTok? Or, or my YouTube? - Yeah, I, yeah. Well, I am now is what I'm doing. Great. I can never have too many fans. Excuse me. So I need to get something very important out of my bag. - Which one? - Mm. Oh, maybe that one. Maybe? You said it was important. - Um, I think making the van feel like Christmas is very important. Oh, and since you seem to be so handy, maybe you can hang them while I start pre-trip interviews for our TikTok. Tick what? You're kidding me, right? Geez. Okay. So what does Christmas mean to you? Uh, family. Uh, we are visiting my sister. Your husband doesn't seem very happy about that. Oh, he's happy. So happy. Okay, let's load up. You know, I feel bad for Dana. It was her idea. - There's definitely enough room. - As long as that snowboard fits. - And despite being a little extra, she does have can-do energy. Don't be a scrooge. Okay, so. In the spirit of Christmas, want a ride? I thought you'd never ask. Yep. That makes two of us. Did that hurt? A lot. ♪ Holiday ♪ Every day with you is like a holiday ♪ Okay, listen up everybody. This here is how it's gonna work. 18 hours to Denver. Now, we probably won't hit any really bad weather until Colorado, but as of right now, I-84 is backed up all the way down to Boise so, may have to take some side roads. We got six drivers. So that's three hour shifts. Bathroom breaks on driver changes only. Meal stops every other driver. That's a great plan. - Thank you. - Except it'll never work. - And here we go. - I'm sorry, but you have made no accommodations for how life actually works. Life? - Yeah, that thing you're almost living. - What exactly makes you the expert on life, hmm? More than my fair share of it. Um, guys, you should know that my license has been temporarily suspended. Distracted driving. I tried to get out of it, but the evidence was on TikTok. Yeah. Fine. Fine. No problem. I'll just rework the schedule for five drivers. - When are we stopping for snacks? See? Life. Traveling all this way, you and your sister must be very close. - We are trying to become closer. What did he say? - He is not as supportive as he could be. Do you have any other family? - Only our son. - Hm. - He lives in London. - Hmm. - Uh, we have not seen him for many years. - I can't imagine. That must be very hard. What did he say? He says, it is complicated. ♪ I'll be home by Christmas Eve ♪ ♪ Leave the lights on the tree ♪ Ooh ♪ Ooh, ooh - ♪ Ooh - Three, two, one. And, hello, Idaho. Whoo! Whoo. Okay. That was terrible. We're gonna need to do that again. I'm not doing it again. I don't expect you to understand but in my world, the last thing you wanna be is boring. And we're boring with a capital B. Speak for yourself. - You all could try my dating app. You have a dating app? Yeah, I do. It's called Check the Box. "Click here for true love." - Are you being serious right now? I am, yeah. And it works. And I gotta say the initial questionnaire, it's pretty fun. Okay, let's check some boxes. All right. ♪ Leave the lights on for me ] So what does Christmas mean to you? - Christmas? - Mm-hmm. - Okay look, I know it's not a popular opinion, but as a data guy, doesn't add up. I mean, people are extra nice to each other for a couple of weeks and then it's just back to business as usual. It's an anomaly. Personally, I'd remove it from any data set, you know? No such thing as Christmas magic. Wow. What's worse than bah humbug? Leave your answers in the comments. It was my first kiss. I was expecting lip on lip. Nobody told me about the French part. All right, next one. Uh, worst first date. Trish's first kiss. - Ember, why don't you take this one? No thanks. I'm good. - Good to get outta your comfort zone. Okay. Okay. Um, well his name was Stevie. Not Steve, not Stephen, Stevie. Stevie? Was he like 12? - 28. - Oh. Mm-hmm. And Stevie still lived with his mom, which is cool. You know, not necessarily a red flag. Lots of young men still do it. Mom. - Turns out Stevie's mom didn't just own their house, she also owned their only car. And Stevie had lost his driving privileges. I feel him. - So Stevie's mom drove us on the date. - Ooh. - Uh-huh. Oh, no, no, no. It gets worse. I sit through the most awkward dinner ever. Get back in the car with Mom. She drives me home, parks the car. Like car in park, engine off. And it's clear at this point that Stevie wants to kiss me goodnight. Oh. - And so I thought I had the perfect out. So I said "I can't. Not in front of your mom." - And he said, I kid you not, "Mom, close your eyes." - I think Stevie should leave the nest. - It sounds like she was coming from a loving place. Really? Mom. - What? He lost his driving privileges. Okay, next question. On a scale from 1 to 10, how important is it to be in a relationship? - 9.5. - Yeah, same for me. But you can't let it show. Oh no. I don't know, six. - Oh. - Mom? I'll pass. What about you guys? 10. Not applicable. Clay? Oh, 10 for sure. You? Three. Um, record scratch. - Three? - Yeah, three. What's wrong with that? No, nothing. Would just be the lowest number ever reported, but... - Do you mean by a group of people going on an app to find love? Biased sample, don't you think? - Well, I think the app works because people are honest. Um, guys? - I'm not convinced the app works at all. I don't think love can be reduced to an algorithm and I personally don't need to be in a relationship to feel complete, so. Stop the car. No, it's not time to switch. - Stop the car. - O-o-okay. - I can't get air. I gotta get outta here. Ah, ah. Oh, oh. Hey, Mom, what's going on? I dunno. Everything suddenly felt like it was closing in. Okay. Should we call for help? No. No, it's fine. Maybe it's just, ah, claustrophobia. What do you think's going on? Maybe she got triggered by Clay's dating app. - Thought only young people got triggered. - Okay, uh, take your time, but- - Oh, what, Ben? Am I embarrassing you? No, sorry. It's fine. You know, really. It's fine. - It's okay. I know just the thing. Keep recording. Hoo. - Tricia, I have a question for you. Do you wanna be helped, heard or hugged? What? - It's a distress management technique I picked up on Shine. It totally works. No. - W-well you have to pick one. - I actually think a hug might help. Well, it's not for you, Ben. No, I meant for her is... I agree. Come on, bring it in. Oh! - Come on, Mom. - Come on. Just try it, please. Oh, for Pete's sake. Oh! Aw. It's working. Oh yeah, yeah. That was nice. - Just a touch of claustrophobia, I think. It's better now. You get all that? You filmed your chest the entire time. Did I? How can this be happening. The most perfect moment ever not recorded. It's like it never happened. No, with this group it is definitely gonna be more than 18 hours. Yeah. I'll call you with updates. Can't wait to see you too. Bye. - Let me guess, an almost love interest. - Eavesdropping part of your skillset? - I wouldn't call it eavesdropping when you're 10 feet away. Mm. Why do you say almost love interest? - Well, I could tell by your tone that you care. "I can't wait," implies passion. But I didn't hear the word love which leads me to believe that you're still in the newish stage. Couple of months. You know, being in different cities, only seen each other a few times. - Let me guess, you met on your app? Told you it worked. - Mm. So she checks all the boxes. - Well, I mean, nobody checks all the boxes, but, you know, what's important to me. Pretty close. - Does she also pack her own snacks while traveling? - Oh, come on. What is your problem with planning? I mean, seriously? - Nothing. I just, I just prefer the unexpected. Hmm. - Oh, come on. - What? Shutting down the interstate. Imagine that. Gimme your hand. - Come on, I'm not giving you my hand. Relax. I don't bite. Come here. I'm just curious how your body reacts to change. So what's the verdict? Could be good for you. - Google says Route 17 to Highway 23 than back on 80. Apple says 17 is slower. - Waze says stay clear of 17 and 23. Hang on, I just lost service. Me too. We're lost? - Oh, we're nowhere close to loss. It wouldn't be the worst thing. One of the many problems with your generation. Have all the answer's right at your fingertips, and you can't even think for yourselves. - You say that like tech's a bad thing. - It is if it tells you what to do. So what's the alternative? - These are called maps. Have at it. Thank you for finally agreeing to do this. - Can we just get this over with? Sure. What do you do for work? Bartender. - Oh, I like that. - Succinct, to the point. Tell me about your family. Next. Dreams? Aspirations? Not to say bartending isn't enough. Next. Okay. Here's one you should be able to answer with maybe a few more words. What does Christmas mean to you? Uh, Christmas means never having enough. - Okay, so you're gonna stay on this road until Route 14, then take a left. Thank you navigator. - Yeah, you know, I had no idea there were so many roads. - It's just kind of cool. - Hmm. - It's nice not being glued to my phone. - Interestingly, research has shown that despite being more connected, people are feeling more lonely than ever. I mean, think about it. If we had all gotten on the plane to Denver, it's unlikely we would've spoken a word to one another, let alone gotten to know each other. Yeah. I hate to admit it. I really hate to admit it, but Dana's right. Might be the best road trip I've ever taken. Is it the only one? Oh, well, yeah, pretty much. - Well, it's definitely the most popular. Last time I checked, #VanClan was blowing up. Blowing up? - Oh, our TikTok people like it a lot. - Tricia, your claustrophobic moment got a ton of likes. Wait, people saw that? - Only the beginning, thanks to Dusty. - Uh, I'm not comfortable with them seeing any of it. - Tricia, vulnerability is courage. Then show some yourself. Oh, I'm sorry.

You mind? - I'm not up for idle conversation right now. Sorry. Suits me. I never am. Where'd you learn to sing like that? Mm. Hmm. My mother and church. - Well, a gift like that shouldn't be hiding behind a bar. I gave it a shot, but, uh, God had other things in mind for me. - God can't do better than that voice. He can and he did. I've got the most beautiful little girl you've ever seen. Hmm. Is there a reason you can't have both? - Well, after I got divorced, the courts determined that this aspiring singer could not provide a stable home. - Mm. - Yeah, so. - Well, growing up poor is the reason why I'm a success. You and me, we got grit. The courts are wrong. - No, they were right. But it's okay. I still got visitation. It's why I'm headed to Denver to see her. Christmas morning, the joy on her face. I can't miss it. Hey guys, loading up. - Hey. - Hi. You okay? Yeah, I just, um, I left something at the airport. Something important? It's all good. No worries. I'm an adventure travel writer so Christmas for me usually means travel. This year, its first tracks through the deepest powder in a hundred years. Last year I was jumping out of a plane over the Sahara. Oh, the year before that it was photographing penguins in Antarctica. - Wow. - Mm-hmm. Do you ever just wanna be at home for the holidays? Not really. You gotta live every day like it's your last, right? ♪ When I see Christmas lights light up your window ♪ ♪ There's a flicker in my mind and I recall ♪ - What did you leave at the airport? - Nothing I can't find in Denver. Little light on specifics. It's just some medication. - Well, if you need, we can probably find a pharmacy. What I need is a navigator. Okay. Keep heading this way. For 25 miles, I think. - Must be hard not having your phone tell you what to do. Funny. I'll have you know, I don't need my phone for everything. Other than finding love. - Look, just because you don't value human companionship- Never said that. - You gave it a three out of ten. - Be-because that's how it's been for me. A bunch of half-step relationships that don't go anywhere because we're so programmed to think we need to be in one that we settle for good enough. I don't wanna settle. I don't want any more half steps. I wanna jump. I wanna jump without knowing where I'm gonna land. - Can I ask you something? - Yeah. Why a dating app? It's what the customers want. Little light on specifics. - Dating can often be hard to navigate. I just wanted to build something to lessen the risk. You know, the disappointment, heartbreak. - Speaking from experience? - Yeah. Well, you might say I'm an expert. - Oh, now we're getting somewhere. No, no, no. That's it. Done. You know who I'd like to meet? Who? The old Clay. The one who still believed in fairytales. Um, guys. Oh, ah. Ah. Oh, sorry, everyone. Oh, ah. - It's okay, gotta stretch my legs anyways. - Oh, I don't know what's wrong with me. It's fine. Really. Turns out claustrophobia is pretty common. - Not claustrophobic. I love elevators. The music, the vibe, it actually calms me. - Excuse me. - What's this? Uh, herbs. For peace. I don't know. I don't know. Come on, Mom. Just take it. What, do I put it in my mouth? No. Your wrist. - Uh, shouldn't we be heading east? Yeah, we are heading east. Look, right there on the map. If we were right there, wouldn't there be a lake right here? Haven't we been on this road. Yeah. I'm backtracking. Christmas is tomorrow. If we're backtracking, we're not gonna make it to Denver in time. - Guys, can we just take a moment and look. If we hadn't gotten lost, we wouldn't be right here right now to see this. Maybe a little Christmas magic. Maybe so. Hey look, if anybody has a better idea than backtracking, I'd love to hear it. - Take this road, cut straight through. - Doesn't even have a name. Probably not even a road. - If it weren't a road, it wouldn't be on a map. She makes a good point. You still think this is a road? - It's getting us where we need to go. Ah! It's probably fine. Okay folks, here we are. - So you're not gonna take any responsibility for this. I'll take full responsibility for getting you outta your comfort zone. - Hmm. - You're welcome. - Yep. - Thank you. You're very welcome. Merry Christmas. Oh guys, we have cell service. Hey everyone. Good news, the Van Clan is back online. Bad news, the van broke.

Can't have it till you accept my apology. Oh, come on. Seriously, You're right. I don't have anyone waiting for me in Denver. - I know, but I made it seem like what's meaningful to you isn't as important as what's meaningful to me. For that, I'm really sorry. Thank you. It was really burning my hand. - Oh, in that case. - Oh, and she's back. I heard about this very, very cool Christmas tree decorating workshop. Oh. What do you say? Wanna show off our mad skills? - On one condition? - Oh, what's that? You tell me about the old Clay. So you don't strike me as a grand gesture kind of guy. - This was bigger than a grand gesture. - What's bigger than a grand gesture? Venti? Bigger, Trenta. This was the equivalent of the biggest coffee order ever. A horse-drawn sleigh, choir singing her favorite song. I even had a dog trained to bring the ring on one of those little barrels around its neck. - Wow. - Yeah. It was the most spectacular Christmas proposal ever. And she said, "No." - What? Not, not even like a, "Let me think about it."? Nope. No thinking required. She was absolutely clear that she would not be marrying me. Wow. That's brutal. I'm sorry. No wonder you're not a fan of Christmas. Right? You know what, here's what I don't get. I mean, I explore human behavior through data analytics. How did I not see it coming? - Uh, maybe because you're not psychic. So, okay, is, is the idea that your app would prevent something like that from happening again? - Well, make it a lot less probable. Hmm. What about outliers? The ones who don't check any of your boxes. Outliers are an anomaly, a mystery we may never understand. Very rare. - So would that relationship be impossible? No. Everything was thought impossible until it happened for the first time. What do you think? What do I think? Yeah, of my mad skills. What do I, about the tree? Yeah. Oh wow. Your side looks like there was a tinsel explosion - and I mean- - Yeah. - Have you actually ever done this before? Not in a very long time. - Man, what do you have against Christmas trees? Nothing. I just, I'm not usually home during the holidays, so. Wow. It's nice. Maybe you should try it sometime. Yeah. Maybe someday. - I, uh, I should- - Yeah. I should, I should uh... - I'm gonna look for some less tinsely decor. - You know, Mom, you don't sound happy to be here. Well, I'm certainly not happy. But I guess if we have to get stranded, at least it's in a town where people really know how to celebrate. Am I right? Am I right? Huh? Come on. Here. Mom, are you sure you're not using this as a way of avoiding what I imagine would be some very complicated feelings around our destination? What are you, 17 going on 30? Honey, I'm completely fine with this. 100% fine. One hundo P. - All right, well if you are 100% completely fine with this, I was thinking when we're in Colorado, we could check out CU Boulder. - I thought you wanted to stay close to home. I mean, to be near your friends. Yeah. No, I do. It's, it's just, you know, we're gonna be so close, wouldn't hurt to look, right? Right. I'm just gonna go pay for this. Yeah, I'll keep you posted. You okay? Yeah. Actually, no, I'm not. Is there anything I can do? - Yeah, you wanna pay my child support? Sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I just, I, I just really need to get to Denver. Okay. Love to talk more, but we need to change into our competition outfits. - Your competition 'fits are different? Yes, of course. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Okay, come on. Wow, this feels like we're in some sort of weird time warp. Oh wait, that's good. Our fans will love #TwilightZone. - Maya, how many followers do you have? - First, I'm super proud you're getting hip with the lingo. Second, across all my platforms, over a hundred thousand. And since Van Clan, growing rapidly. - Okay. This could actually work. - And that's how we ended up spending Christmas Eve in Greenfield, home to the Elf Games. More on that later. So I'm reaching out to you all, my awesome Maya Way or the Highway family, to see if someone generous in holiday spirit could pick up the car part and deliver it to us so we can get to our friends and family on Christmas Day. And I'll tag you, obvi. Bye. Wow. You were so on point. Is that a compliment? - Do you really think this is going to work? I just don't want everyone to be disappointed. I'm not holding my breath. Oh, you guys, it worked. - Really? - Yeah. The part will be here in five hours. - Really? - Yes. - Looks like Trey is my number-one fan. So, now we wait. I have a much better idea. Thank you. Hey y'all, check out this 'fit. Whoo, whoo. If you're wondering why I am dressed like this, lemme give you a hint. This is Santa's workshop. For real. Ho, ho, ho. Welcome friends and neighbors to the annual Elf Games. Okay, folks, let's try to keep it clean, fun, and safe. No booing, cheating, or sabotage, you know who you are. We're really doing it, y'all. I don't know about you, but this is by far the craziest Christmas Eve I've ever had. Oh, let's check in with the Van Clan. Hey, in one word, how are you feeling? - Pumped! - Okay. Anxious. Itchy. Like a winner! No comment. - Confused as to why we're doing this. Okay guys, I know we're all a little out of our comfort zone and we're going up against some seasoned pros, but here's what we've got going for us. We just spent two days together in a van learning both about each other and from each other. Together, we've overcome every obstacle put in our way and that is what makes us a team. That's the reason we're gonna succeed. Are you with me? - Oh, yes. - Yes. Are you with me?! Whoo! - Okay, you got it. Got it, got it. The corner! Come on guys, you're catching up.

What's wrong? - Nothing. I just, I pushed too fast. - Go, Clay. - No, no. I'm not leaving you. Yeah! You all right? Thanks. - Maybe it's time to share some specifics. - Yeah. I was born with a bum heart. It's much better now. But growing up, my parents lived in fear of losing me every day. I spent my childhood indoors watching the world go by from my bedroom window. Must have been really hard. Yeah, it was. But you know, when I turned 18, I decided I didn't wanna spend the rest of my life stuck and afraid, reading about other people's adventures. I've been making up for lost time ever since. - So, live every day like it's your last. Yeah. For me it could be. Sorry, Dana. You should be. We could have been champions. Thanks. Yeah. Good news. Christmas has arrived. Hi, I'm Maya. I mean you already know that, but hi. I'm Trey. Uh, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. You are literally Santa's best helper. As promised, I'll make your socials blow up. - Oh, that's, uh, super cool and all. But we're gonna need a little more than that. I'm sorry? - Uh, w-what do you mean by more? - Oh, we're just thinking a delivery charge of say like two grand. Oh, well that is just rude. What would your mother think? She came up with the idea, so. Wow. I'll pay it. - Not a problem. - Not a problem? Not a problem? No, this is a massive problem. If you think you can come in here and hold that car part hostage, which is literally the complete opposite of the Christmas spirit, you're in la-la land. And I don't mean the movie. - Actually, that's exactly what we think we can do. So we take Venmo or... So I'm an influencer, obvi. But if that doesn't work out, I'll probably work in the hotel business with my dad. What does Christmas mean to me? Well, I'll get back to you on that. I just don't get how friends could be so cold and heartless. - Maybe because they're not friends. What's that supposed to mean? It was just money, Maya. Maybe to you, to some of us, it's an awful lot of cash to just hand over. - Yeah, well, I spent too much time caring about money. Hmm. That's the attitude, Dusty. I don't care what these guys think. I refuse to let this ruin our journey. I'm just gonna put the whole thing behind me. I'm Teflon. Um, guys. You're in la-la land. And I don't mean the movie. They did not. They did. On Instagram. Oh, no. - And TikTok. - Oh, no. - And YouTube. - Oh, no. - But you know, it's just the holidays. You know, who's even paying attention, really? What did he say? He feels badly for her. It's like one minute, I'm on top of the world feeling so much love. And then just like that I'm over, done, cooked. That's not true. Because of you, our story has impacted so many people. - Yeah. Like Amy and Bart at the diner. No one's gonna care anymore. - Maya. - I don't want a hug, Ben. I wasn't offering. Oh. - What I, what I was gonna say is, if you connect your self-worth to what other people think, you'll never be truly happy. That's very wise, son. - Thanks. I learned it from my mom. Nevermind. I would like a hug. Oh yes. Yes. Um, guys... - Hey, Mom. What happened? We were so close to Denver. I know. I know. I think that's the issue. Oh, sorry for all the drama, everyone. Okay, here's the situation, um, Ben and I are going to Denver to meet his birth mother. And I think what's happening to me is I'm scared. Scared I'm gonna be replaced. Mom, what? Look, she might be the woman that brought me into this world, but you are my mom and nothing is ever gonna change that. Ever. I love you, Ben. Oh. Oh it, it's midnight. Merry Christmas, everyone. - Oh, Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - Benny, Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Traditional Chinese Christmas cookies. Um, they bring good fortune. - Thank you. - Oh, you're welcome. You're welcome. Oh. - Ah, Tricia. - Thank you. You're welcome. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you. - You're welcome. Merry Christmas. - Hard to believe that just two days ago, none of us even knew one another. - And now- - We do. It wouldn't have happened if you didn't bring everyone together. Well, without your generosity, we wouldn't have had a ride. So without each other... - We would've carried on with our lives. Business as usual. So maybe this is proof of Christmas magic. - I think we have enough data to support that, yeah. Well, here's to saying yes. Even when you don't want to. And black coffee. And destiny. Destiny. - Shouldn't you be filming this Insta-perfect moment? It's perfect because I'm not. ♪ Everybody wake up Three, two, one. Hello, Denver!

How could you? - Well, uh, don't need Google Translate to sense the tension here. Listen to me. I love you both. You are my whole world. But this feud between you is breaking my heart. - Dad, I, I couldn't have done it without you. Look, I meant no disrespect in leaving, Baba. - Y-you cannot teach someone to dream, then not let them dream. Now, I am happy. Hello, I'm Ming. - Hi. Oh, it's so nice to meet you. I'm Tricia. Oh, I know all of you already. Been watching Maya's TikTok. So fun and emotional. Aw, thank you. I really needed that right now. - Come. I have gifts for all of you. Let's go into the house. It is tradition. I'll be right in. Hey, I'm almost there. What? No, don't, don't say that. I am not a bad mother. Matt, just put her on the phone. Put her on the phone. Matt. Matt. Ember? - Retired. - Mm. But I used to work in energy. - Oh, can you elaborate? - Nope. Okay. So what does Christmas mean to you? Not what it used to. It's hard to believe that she wouldn't at least say goodbye. - What if something happened to her? Should we call the authorities? - Mom, chill. She took her stuff. It's just so weird. Did she say anything to you? I mean, you two seem to have formed a genuine connection. - I don't have any more information than you. I'm sure she had her reasons. - Looks like someone found a little Christmas spirit. Yeah, well. Now Dusty, you never mentioned why you're heading to Denver. See my daughter. Oh, what's her name? - Annie. - Aw. - I love that name. - Yeah. Wow. - Well, she certainly loves Christmas. - Well, that's one thing we have in common. I mean, besides you, of course. Ben? - You know, may-maybe this was a bad idea. You know, wh-what if she doesn't like me? Oh, Honey. - You know, someone really cool once told me that if you connect your self worth to what other people think, you'll never truly be happy. Now, do you wanna be helped, heard or hugged? What do you think? Okay, okay. Now go. Get your bag, sweetheart. Oh, thank you. We are all so lucky we met. - Ben's lucky to have you. Remember that. Thank you. Ben? Tricia, hi. Hi. I'm so happy you're here. Can I take your bags? Oh, sure. - This may be the end of our journey, but it's not goodbye. Stop. Let's go again. All good things eventually come to an end. Cut. Ah, let's just, let's go again. When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. - Really? - Seriously. - I can just do it later. No biggie. Just a lot of pressure when you're all like here, watching me, IRL. Huh? In real life. Ah. Well, real life can be hard sometimes, But totally worth it. You're a really good guy, even though you pretend not to be. - Thanks. You're pretty awesome yourself. Even though you don't know it yet. - I hope you both get everything you want for Christmas. You too. - Bye, Maya. - Bye. Bye. - You sure we can't take you somewhere else? Nope. This'll do. All right. Take care, Dusty. - Have a nice holiday with your daughter.

Portland to Denver in a van full of strangers. I know what you'd say, "Recipe for disaster." And I thought the same. But it wasn't. Met some great folks. Learned how to post, #olddognewtricks. I mean, uh, I'd go so far as to say it was one of the best trips I ever went on. Well, not including the ones with you, of course. I'm so sorry we couldn't have more of 'em. I got caught up trying to provide for you. I couldn't see that all you wanted was was me. - Here, honey, I want you to meet my friend, Dusty. Dusty, this is my daughter, Grace. - Amazing Grace. - It's nice to meet you. - Mommy, can I go play in the snow? Yeah. Stay close. How'd you find me? - Dana told me where they dropped you. It's all there. I've, um, I've never done anything like that before. I just wanted to show that I could be a good mom, that I could provide. - Here's what I can tell you about being a parent. No one ever gets it a hundred percent right. I sure didn't. And now, for me, it's too late. I lost Annie three years ago. Car accident. I can't even imagine. - It's not too late for you, Ember. - I don't even know where to start. Start with this. You find yourself a place to live here in Denver. - I'm not taking your money, Dusty. - Oh, you'd be doing me a bigger favor than I'm doing you. So take it. Please. I don't know how to thank you. - That's easy. Just start singing again. - Yeah, okay. I can start singing again. If you're there to listen. I can do that. - Oh, it's on. Little whippersnapper. - Hi y'all. For those of you still watching, thank you. And for those of you who aren't, I'm okay with that. Our Van Clan journey has come to an end. And what a wild ride it has been. I know, for me, it's changed the way I see the holidays. - I love it. It's exactly what I wanted. - I used to think Christmas meant dressing up in fancy clothes, sipping on champagne, and getting a ton of presents from my parents who are stranded in New York this year. Love you guys. But the holidays are so much more. It's a time to be with the people we love. Even if we have to travel halfway around the world during the busiest time of the year, just so we can see their faces. It's totally worth it. - So when the ER doctor finished examining him, he asked what's his favorite food? And I said, "Carrots." That's why he was orange? Yep. Mother of the year. You are. I mean that. I never could have given him this life. Not back then. Well, you're in his life now and that's what matters. Hey Mom, and Beth, uh, check this out. - Because Christmas has a way of bringing people together, reconnecting families and friends, or friends who become family, reminding us that the greatest Christmas gift of all is luck. Dana! What are you doing? - I know how much you like tinsel so I brought you this. - You flew up here to give me an ornament? That and, uh, I want to jump. - Okay, you're not really dressed - for it- - No, no, no, no, no. I mean, I mean with you. I'm wrong again, aren't I? Oh wow, uh. Oh no. I mean just 'cause I was feeling something you weren't, I- - It's nice to meet the old Clay. It's nice to have him back. So how do we get down? - Oh, we jump. - What? - I'm kidding. We'll take the chopper. Oh, okay. We gotta go. We got somewhere we have to be. Love in all its many forms. I learned that from eight complete strangers. In any other circumstance, we would've never met. I mean, you could see how different we all were, but somehow our goal of getting home for Christmas put us on common ground, allowing us to share stories, laughter, and love. And in the end, truly embrace that destiny was our destination. Shout out to my Van Clan family.
