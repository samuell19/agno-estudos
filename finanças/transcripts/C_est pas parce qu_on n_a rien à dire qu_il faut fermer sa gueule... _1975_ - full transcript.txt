From expensive to cheaper. Of course that's all there is. At least it rolls. Yeah it rolls but does it stop? Oh God surely it stops, even without braking. Well then have you decided? Anyway I have nothing else, it's the last category Is this the collector's department? Yeah well precisely, that's why it's a deal. Well for those who love souvernirs. Retro fashion - Yeah the exodus the maquis the liberation, even looks like it was bombed. Well it's thirty five thousand. Are you crazy? After that I only have my son's scooter. Say Max, it's still expensive, isn't it? Shit, don't push! Don't push? We'll see eh Was it necessary to to buy this shit? In every business, you have to invest. Push! I am pushing, push push but push yourself too And there you go. Come on Come on! Riton! You think that it's really necessary? It is essential, I already explained. If we want to have every chance on our side we must leave nothing to chance. Come on. Ah this can't be true. Come on. You ok? Ouch Riton, you still there? Riton, come on. Riton, are you Riton? Riton! Riton, we're here, we made it, with you. You don't want me to give you mouth to mouth? There are hotels for that! - You pervert! 35,000 is too much. - Yes well it's ok, we'll make it. Where are we? - In the casino parking, come on. We will get our order, come on. It's no longer useable. Max! It's open. Look at this. Oh my I swear Here, look...

One hundred and thirty five thousand, This is a good investment for a father. It's not the time to do the math, come on. Here, get in. Here, exit ticket. And gently in the turns! OK, I will drive like you. Where's the cigarette lighter Whoa, my arm! Sorry The fence! A dead body? Come on! Say Max, we have to be really sure. Yeah, Fano will be really upset. I ask for an American car and what do you guys bring me? some old things and what? a beautiful pair of slippers and a moped A petrolette for a cadillac? Even with rising gas prices you think the client is going to be happy? No, you guys can't be serious and what do you want me to do with this? Look, I'm not selling to immigrant workers I can't work with you guys in these conditions. Come on Fano you can't dump us now... Til now everthing was against us I don't want to offend you but you have to admit it... you guys are made to be honest people. Honest? That hurts Fano you know? Just say that we are dumb idiots. bah Anyway Fano in life, you will only have a few faithful friends You can count them with your fingers. In any case, you know that idiots can always be useful. Fano, help convert us Give us an opportunity cause in DIY well we lose our means a little. Well, what can one do. You know we would cut ourselves in 4 pieces for you. It's already tough with 2 of you. Yes we were lost, we messed everything up Max you make me sad and what about friendship? Doesn't it count? You'll see the two of us now you'll see I don't believe it because it's really tough My God it's the fifth time like this I'm not sure what to do. You will see Fano, will help us. This time you really got hit by grace it's a genius idea but who to trust? Only the small staff left we may be great in solitude alone we can do nothing Yet for such a plan any asshole would do. But how to find this guy I will need a pair A pair? I have the pair. I immediately thought of you because I highly esteem you. Yes yes My grudge is finished, this is the big promotion, the top. I will give you your last chance and this time with a jackpot at the end. You see i don't hold a grudge You see, it's better to be single with this new job, particularly in this case Why is that? Because I need guys without any ties. There are risks, you're still not a big fan huh? Straight away you have a skate drama mentality Well then, I'll put it away. Come on Fano you know we would take a bullet for you. eh? OK There are times when i wonder if you deserve me. Oh well. So, this is going to be a hit equal to the mail train robbery. Don't panic, I'm the brain you just have to execute. The entrance to the station Here, the sncf pension fund. Here, the vault in the basement Double wall tingsten steel Inside five bricks. Five bricks? Max! Five bricks! Fifty thousand new francs. No, five new sticks. You mean five hundred million? We're through with small jobs. Oh five hundred million! Yes The money will be deposited in the safe on Wednesday at noon and picked up on Friday morning which leaves us thirty-six hours to operate. On the other side of the wall that overlooks the safe, public toilets. We're going through this wall The wall of the toilets? Toilets? That can't be right. That's the great idea We just have one problem. It won't be easy, a comac obstacle the Chinese wall, the peepee lady. The hardest part is going to be putting you in the client's skin. To get used to it. It will require psychology, flexibility Take for example, like this I am madam peepee When you enter, what do you say? Hello madam, it's a nice day eh? There it is, the mistake. Speaking of the sun to an unfortunate woman passing her days in earthenware and deodorant, Start again! Yes well yes Hello Mrs. how are you? Fool! She is over sixty she is covered in pain and she spends her days scrubbing the toilets and you ask her How are you? So what do I have to to ask her? Here, take my place okay. Saucer ... What? Saucer, there for madame pipi it is necessary to put a saucer there. Oh this can't be true, it would take five of me to work with people like you. And you dumbass? What are you waiting for! Give a saucer to Madame. There? It's ok now? Yes Good day Miss. And there you go! Ah yeah that's all! We just want to give her some warmth, some respect for her femininity. Ah shit - how much of a tip should we give as we go out? I have three francs. This can't be possible! One franc maximum! It has to look real, not too much and not too little. Fano, I have to tell you, you are truly a boss. Each era has its own sword, there was Bonnie and Clyde, hot ferrule, the mail train guy. Tomorrow Mr Fano will enter the league of Legends. We are proud to be working with you. Right Max, it's true? Yes. Look, like a programmed robot here she goes! 7:59 Ten seconds to rummage through her bag. Thirty seconds to open the gate with a key like this Another twenty seconds to go down the twenty two steps. Ad at eight o'clock sharp she puts on her apron. How do you know all this? - What do you think? For eight days, every morning I am here, the stopwatch in my hand, feet in my feet in the humidity, and my head in the smoke. We shouldn't exaggerate, all is electric here. Why what did you say? You said bullshit again, and i don't like to be interrupted Madame Pipi's life is as regulated as... Toilet paper! Like music! Ah yes right, that's what I wanted to say. In short, we have a common enemy. Let's not exaggerate, This woman looks really nice. It's not the time, You never know the hidden part of the iceberg. Believe me I know. Don't worry, I know women and there are none that are insensitive. There are only clumsy people. You big fool, did you look at her? She's not the totally honest type. and then it bothers you, that it isn't so much to your advantage. So let's synchronize, at the top it will be 8:03 Top! In two minutes, you follow me Hello madam! Hello sir you are my first customer. Well then you will see, I will bring you happiness. Ah bah I hope so because things aren't so bright. You can feel it here, there is a sort of discomfort. Inflation... I don't do politics. They watch, read and then do nothing. They hold back Decadences of a society, even the churches are empty. Don't you think this is a bit much? Well here we go. No no no! I'm telling you, I forgot my money. That doesn't work with me. I swear, I forgot it. I will come back to pay you later madam Just borrow me for now. No sir I already said, I don't borrow. Get out of here! It isn't free for anyone. Don't live above your means! The nerve! We have to change this. You were right, she doesn't seem very friendly. We will have to be careful. Deflate! You're not going to be scared by a woman? A woman never scared me. Me either. Are you guys done? It's cabin number three the one in the middle that overlooks the safe. Any questions? Are you ready? Perfect! There are imperishable minutes, I dive. The Japanese, they copy everything. In two months, you will find the same toilets in Tokyo. Sorry, I got here before you! Well, there! Well what? I also planned for the unexpected. That is the brain. Excuse me Soon they will hire dancers! It's like the wailing wall. This one stayed 3 minutes. I knew a guy who had a hard time He would take a while. A maniac? No an intellectual! maniac Hey We have a small cavity It's no big deal we'll fix it. A small intervention Nothing at all. Hello Madam Rose! Hello Gaston So how are you today? When it's not worse, it gets better. When I was a kid, we used to do distance competitions So, you're beating your record? Well?

Not for very long! Not bad eh? Too much is too much. What did you do? What do you mean what did I do? You just have to push! I did push!! You must have pulled. I know when I push and when I'm pulling! I've been using public toilets for a long time. I'm going to complain about this. Excuse me, we were here. The lady isn't responsible for anything. Be understanding, it's an accident. You see she's not happy to see you in this way. You think I'm getting splashed in the face for fun? If you complain she will have problems. At her age, to find another job. There you go. It's just mechanical, always mechanical. It's this cheap stuff. The other day someone stole my glasses. I'm sorry sir. OK ok ok ok Look at me, what do I look like. Here sir, go in here and I'll take care of your clothes. We have a moment, we can fix it. We will save you some trouble with the paperwork. Thank you. Don't push. Be careful, be careful, that's easy to say. I'm ready. Coming! I'm putting a sign, no one will disturb you. Thanks a lot. I feel better now, I had a straight back. Nice. Look, did you see? I never thought of using the crapper to date someone. It is logical as it is a place where a lot of people go. It's not the case with me, it's for those guys who have no success. They're shy so they have to manage. It's for those guys who don't have Pep. The what? Pep You don't know what pep is? Well you for example, you're not worse looking than me, bout you don't have it. No pep. I'm going to tell you something I may not have the pep, but I have the eye. eh I am twenty eight years old I am small blond and I have blue eyes Me, I am big, brune, and I have pep. Why Max am I working for the two of us? That's it, it is fixed! Thank you mister, the house is open, feel like you're at home! Well, we'll definitely take advantage of it. After the study of the cubage given the weight of the rubble to be evacuated, and taking into account, two minutes twenty seconds average time cabin occupancy, and since I thought of everything we can't fail. I won't mention the differential equations in the complexity of the process is a matter of math logic. Okay okay However, for something more within your reach, I have planned for each of you Yes? A viaticum. A viaticum? A viaticum Which will cover the whole operation. Platform tickets and twenty coins of fifty cents. I planned big. Yes it's good Any questions? No I don't think so. Oh I have one. Don't you think that by seeing us going in and out, Madame pipi will eventually spot us? There you go!

Heart attack is on the left and now the van is on the right eh Now go away! What are you doing here? Get out of here. Allow me, airmail coming through. If you want your mail to arrive on time, excuse me And we at the post flying through the cordillera of the Andes it means nothing? Excuse me Hello These guys are heroes , death awaits them at every step uh It's unthinkable. I'd be dumber to listen to him. Why I always have the bum clothes? There my little Riton, you are going to be dressed like a prince. Oh no Why did you take my costume? it's not yours if I'm wearing it. Thief! I will tell Fano! I don't care. Fano, Rito took took my favorite costume. I wanted to be in Scottish attire. Well let me allow you a minute to get your mind back. Yes but the Scottish, that's me not him. We already have a lot on our plate why does it really matter? If I'm not Scottish I will stop everything Very well, Riton will be punished Give me your bag For five hundred bricks I would disguise even as a can delivery guy. Is it really that difficult? If there is a grain of sand in the mechanical, everything falls apart. It's ok. Do it for us, for you, for Fano I was supposed to be Scottish. They promised me Scottish. Say, you can't tell him something now? Are you going to the toilets or give me crap? Lily! Lily! Well Frederic, you're talking to hippies? He's joking, I've never seen him before. He's a stranger. Lily, my dear He's really insisting. Please edgar, be nice and do something for this poor fellow. More like poor drug addict. Lily, it's me Max. Don't cry I told you I'll punish him. It's not Riton, it's Lily that came by, She didn't recognize me. Ah yes, don't worry she'll come back. When? When you will be rich, go on! America! Perfect! It's closed. Who closed it? What do I do? You're keeping count Madam Rose? As usual Mister Gaston. We will meet again eh We got it guys, it's there! How about you calm down my son. You take the baggage. I will clean. Thank you sir! Youssef the Queen Don't worry I'll be right back. Sorry my father, it was open. Bye Madam. That damn thing will stir up the whole station. You think we should answer it? And say what? It's Madam Pipi, I'm listening? Hello Romeo? - What, it's you? Everything is going well. Why don't you use radio? How does it work? Wait i will explain it to you. I don't deserve that. It's a great job, pure beautiful artist work. Stop dreaming shit! I want to know the progress. We are moving forward! Time is money. Fano is impatient. And me, you think I sleep in the sun? Well you are lucky at least you are doing something. What do I do during this time? I just think. I heard something. It's surely Fano. But Fano would have warned us. Close the door. We're finished. Are you there? Answer me, are you there? Is it you who has pep? I'm going to slap you. Are you there? Answer you imbecile! Yes yes, it's me I'm here but I'm busy Ah I understand, you have a comrade I don't want to be indiscreet See you later, leave me a note. Yes that's it, later I will leave you a word. It worked, back to the job now. You know huh, I'll tell it to Fano. Some pretend to be lazy to be dishonest. There. You're turn now. Already? Yes I need to pee. What is that for? How were you educated, in front of somoene? No kidding! This must be what the anguish of a father feels like. Wow it's beautiful. And they say that money doesn't smell. Alpha calling Romeo, Alpha calling Romeo Hello? Answer me Romeo. Max! Answer me I'm stuck I can't get out Alpha Romeo Alpha Romeo, Hello Alpha Romeo Riton calling Max!

I'm getting a heart attack again. New heart attack. Unbelievable There's a lot here. I have the impression there's enough. How much? Enough. I can't believe it. Police, Hands up! It was too good to be true. Never do that again! Forward in the post in front of the enemy. We'll fix it later. Get the suitcase. You take the money. Put it in, and I'll get the car Come on. I like that. You see. I planned too small. We can't leave it behind. Look at all that is left still. There is only one solution. Let's go. Alpha calling Romeo Alpha calling Romeo Listening alpha The car is ready. I am beginning to understand why we call this heavy francs. Oh my. You always have to get noticed. I have the impression that the suitcase is transparent In the name of God! You could have bought something more solid. Yes but since it was going to be used just once, There was no need to waste money. Come on let's go. It doesn't want to start. Is there something wrong? He prepared it for the twenty four hours of le mans! We can't stay here! You see, she will never start! Let's get a taxi instead. We should leave this anyway it's not properly registered. If we wait a taxi we'll be here forever. Ok well, there is only one solution. To the metro train. Come on Come on! Hey! You three! Move the car, you can't park here. You understand? Move it! Excuse me I have a problem, silly breakdown, an unfortunate setback a ridiculous incident Yes we looked for a tow truck. I hear this trick ten times per day, what is wrong with it? Well it's the starter. Let me try. Come on We're going to get it now. Well then, the papers, car registration, certificate insurance, permit Don't make the officer wait. So where is it? It's hiding. I'll get you for that later. There. It's not the same address. Yes, I just moved. I was dropped by a big promoter. We will put this in proper order by going to the police station of your neighborhood. As soon as I have the ticket I will go and fix it. Hey Fano, look! That will be all for this one, but next time, we will tow it. Wait! We say Goodbye officer sir Bye officer! The car! Hurry, quick! Piece of junk! Mr officer! She won't start again. She doesn't want to start. Well then? What do you say? Thank you officer! Go on. I plan down to the smallest detail and what happens? An idiot puts the suitcase on the sidewalk. It' not even me who messed up with the car no? It's bad luck. Worse, the cherry the scoumoune the black day yes well I don't give up I'm planning one embellished Hey what did i tell you, there! Get on the bus and take the suitcase down. What about the driver? Make yourself small. Hurry up! Easy for them to say, I'm the one taking the risk. You gonna leave him alone you thugs? Shut the hell up! Leave him alone you little idiots! Aren't you ashamed, screaming vulgarities to children? There messing with us! Come on there.

It's not like your going to fall into prudence! We're almost there! Look, over there! Slow down! Are you trying to pass them up? Oh no, tell me it's a nightmare. We're back to where we started. It's full of cops. What do we do Fano? With your stupidity, we're good for a suicide mission. We need a volunteer. Come on! For Frankfurt! Place 804, 42 Go ahead. Hey! Your ticket! I'm just accompanying them. Without a ticket you can't go. Hey! I need a ticket. I don't have anymore. Some coins quick! I'm taking note. You think I'm the one that is suppose to have coins?

Well yes You bring this to the lady From me Execute! Excuse me, this is from the gentleman over there What is it? I don't know it's surely a mistake. Fuck mistakes I'll show you! Excuse me sister. I haven't even left yet! That'll teach you! It's not my fault! Where did he go? It's nice of you guys to have come get me. It's crazy how much we get attached to things. Come on, Come on You think that's for us? Allow me, give me the suitcase. You shouldn't carry that it's too heavy for you grandma. I got it Would you please hold my suitcase while I get my ticket? You OK aunt? You had a good trip? What's new in the country? Let me hold your basket. It's heavy huh? eh That's good now it's over Finished, ah yes give me back my suitcase Come on let's go, that's good. A point for you, come on. Look at him, we forgot to load the meter. You can't escape your fate. Implementation of the back up plan. Damn suitcase but it's your fault if in the meantime a setback will end in disaster. To think that with all this dough we have to take public transport. Money reveals bullshit. That's it yes here you go. It is done. Ok so that's four hundred and sixty eight million five hundred and sixty thousand old francs I was told five hundred, they live well at the pension fund. Oh yes then that makes one hundred and forty nine million five hundred and twenty thousand each The minimum wage. But you forgot the odds and ends. - What? Odds and ends. I will explain. Firstly, provisions for identification investments, model tooling, purchase of three wallets, dock label, scraps, Six bricks. Cost of living increases every day. Good, with one hundred and forty seven units I will try to make do. That's not the end. What else is there? The fines, then, Max, for throwing the suitcase in spite of the, common sense. Forty thousand new francs. We don't leave Riton, Riton.. Riton For the car that did not start, for using the phone at a critical time, for stealing the costume and, upsetting his comrade, I had a bonus point too, right? I know, I took it into account. The bonus, four units. Well Okay and don't complain, I didn't count my brain. It's a good thing we aren't. Well let's share because I want to go home it's been twenty four hours that we've been sitting on this money. - The money will not move from here. Why? You are really amateurs huh? If we change our habits, the palaces the champagne, girls, we will get nabbed by the cops. This money must be forgotten, let it sleep for six months. It will be in hibernation. Then I agree to the social evolution but until then, I'll give you three hundred and five per month. Where is my bedroom? Why? I sleep where the money is. You are wary of me? Yes! Suckers! Taking advantage of me sleeping. What is this? You can't even go pee now. Seeing how we are, we're good for depression, a nervous breakdown What do you propose? We don't know who will press the button first. Let's have a truce. We should be friends. Who will do what? Ok but I am not doing the cooking! Sirs, to our collaboration. And to the conclusion! Happiness is certainly something. Hello! The ministers are leaning towards a reform for jails. The middle east is still a barrel of powder. But first of all, the theft of the year. Let's go to our reporter who is on site. Last night, some thiefs got a hold of 460 million francs from a retirement fund safe, in a Paris warehouse. The gangsters must have been disturbed during their job because they left behind 50 million. - I planned too small. We will deduct that. The brains behind this seem to have planned everything down to the smallest detail. It must be the Brittish behind that. Brittish? Why would they look elsewhere for what we have here? Mrs Rose, what did you notice? Look at the camera I have nothing to say, there's a lot of people that go by here. Anything suspect, suspicious? I know nothing, saw nothing... Saw nothing, heard nothing, that's super. Not even a guy who saw anything, totally anonymous. What Max? Are you absent? I don't like it when you are absent I talk. Shut up You know who you are talking to? -mumble- Did you see a ghost? Worse guys, worse. What? Hello my little plumbers, what a good surprise! Your excellent education will certainly push you to offer me a chair? A gentleman remains a gentleman in all circumstances. What's up? What is the honor? Joy Imagine that just last night someone broke through the wall of my bathrooms. Vandals. We saw on tv you didn't see anything, and have nothing to say. Yes, but it's not because we have nothing to say that you should keep your mouth shut, right? Well then what do you want? We will see soon, but not here. If you don't mind I'd rather go to your house tomorrow At five 'o' clock? No need to give me the address, I know. Why 5 o clock, why not dinner? When there is enough for three, - There's enough for four. And Fano is right, in life you have to know how to compose. If she wants a share, it's not coming from mine. We must give her. Careful, here she is. I used to spend winters in Cannes, but not for climatic reasons. Casinos in general. You were a player? Since birth! Oh If you had seen the powerful of this world the great players, the virtuosos joking on a green carpet loosing millions oh! It was beautiful, it was good, we wanted to applaud. You're trying to reassure us? Ah on the contrary I learned a lot. What? That the customer never wins. What I understood is that it is better to be on the side of the bank. And all you needed was? - The funds. Yes, and you guys arrived like the Messiah. It was you I was waiting for Already in my plan, which lacked only a hand that would guide us towards a bigger cause. When people play, money comes in, transforms, goes from hand to hand. We don't know where it comes or where it goes. Enough to simplify your little problem of recirculation. And then, it would be so painful to be forced to bring you oranges to your health. So? associates? It's easy to say. Good Riton! Stephane, perfect! Ah Max, I recognize your taste. Your attention to detail in clothing, but we will have to change it a bit. For the client you must be colorless, odorless and tasteless. And now gentlemen, let's grow your small capital. Fifty thousand Five thousand With the table Ten thousand, banco gentlemen. Going well? Sir is asking 80 thousand. No! Forty thousand in the banco, closing It's okay Rito?
