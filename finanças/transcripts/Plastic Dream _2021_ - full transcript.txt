Let's move it to 5 pm, Tuesday but I need to get out at 6 pm. Let's just write a check-up for it. Sorry I kept you waiting. Yes, what seems to be the problem? Lately, my body has developed some itchiness. Also, I have a skin rash on my eyebrows and my hair. I understand. Here, let's take a look. Here, have a seat, please. Look ahead. Okay. It's not serious. Skin dryness. Probably a seasonal thing. These days we often see it, especially with women. I'm prescribing you shampoo and a lotion. Use them regularly, come again next week and we'll check it out. - Thank you. - Sorry, just a minute. How old did you say you are Belma? 37. Yes, 37. Don't get me wrong. It seems to me that you take good care of your skin. However, as you know lines appear as years pass by and get deeper, isn't that right? Let me explain. A person has an average of 40 fat pads on her face. What happens to them in time? They decrease. And then what happens? Our face starts to lose its vitality and its glow. Your skin type has its advantages, but the lines are starting to show themselves. We can fix them with light touches what do you say? - How? - We can apply botox? - Botox? - Yes, botox. In your case just a small dose of filler. We can restore those to the way they were. I've never thought about getting botox. Of course, it's your call, but you are at a critical age. I advise you to do it before it's too late. We can start with small doses, one ml, see the results, if you like you can come back after four months. We'll apply a small dose again. We'll advance with caution, as a safety measure. Thank you very much, I don't want to do it, thanks. Sure. Just in case, I'll give you a brochure. Take a look. You'll come in for a follow-up anyway. We'll talk about it again. It's not so bad. Let's sleep, shall we? Okay. Can we just sleep? Can we please just sleep Mehmet? Okay, why are you snapping? I'm not snapping, I just want to sleep. Good night. - Belma! - Okay, I'm here. Are we leaving? Don't you think you overdid it with the make-up? It's my usual. It's just that you usually like it more minimal. I have a meeting, that's why. I'm ready. I see. Do it more often. Why? Didn't you like it the way I looked before? You got me wrong. I like your normal look but this looks beautiful, too. Makes you look vibrant. Do I look pale normally? No, come on! Oh god! I said that it looks beautiful, this looks beautiful. I usually look ugly you say? What are you trying to say? Nothing! Can we leave? I'm getting late again. If you're getting late, why continue? You make me regret that I said anything! Hello, Tuğba. I'm looking at the annual sale performance report about this product, no. 17. There are no sales this year? Hello everyone, I'm Zeynep Suruç from Secret Yoga. Today, we are doing a short real-time face yoga. Before we start, we are sure that our face and hands are clean. Now, I'm placing these, my hand bones to where my scalp starts. I'm flexing my forehead up to the max. Chin is a little up, glances are down. What have I done? I moved the muscles over my eye upwards. Don't forget to breathe in and out. Nice and slowly let go. Neck is loose. Chin is loose. Again, I'm flexing my forehead up to the max. I'm lifting my eyebrows up and I'm starting to do the move. Neck is loose. Don't forget to breathe in and out. Shit! Very good! Here is your order ma'am. Ma'am? Total is 25 liras. - There is no butter, where is it? - You didn't order the butter. - I did and you forgot. - You didn't... I did and you forgot. Why are you talking? Come on, run! - I... If you wrote... - Give me that 10. Come on, chop-chop! I'm in a hurry, chop-chop! Okay, fine! Good night everyone! Tonight we'll be discussing another hot topic. Botox and plastic surgery. I'm here today with Prof. Dr. Ferhat Gedikli. Honey turn the volume up, let's watch this. The game will start, I want to watch that. You can watch your game, let's watch this a bit. What "pfff," let's watch this for a while. Fine. Let me explain that. We used to wait for the wrinkles to get permanent and then do the botox but now the trend is this, we advise to do the procedure before wrinkles get permanent at the age of 24-25. Because when wrinkles get permanent botox may not be enough. The earlier you start the easier you prevent the effects of ageing. Well, I'm gonna ask you another question from our audi... Up with the eyebrows now. Eyebrows up, wonderful! Release, please. Eyebrows up again. Yes, very good. Look, below our eyes... Now release. Let's do under eye fillers for that area of your eyes so that we can get rid of these shades. Yes, very beautiful, very beautiful indeed. This area too. It'll be perfect. Now... Ah look, there is sagging skin in the temples. Here please, yes we'll also apply here to get your eyebrows even. Speaking of eyebrows, when we apply a very small dose here, yes, I think we are ready, aren't we? We'll do the procedure with the cannula method. After the procedure you might have some bruises and maybe oedema. However, we don't panic because the substance we're injecting you is hyaluronic acid a hydrophilic substance. These effects are common. Let's say it's short-term effects. Belma! Come, come. Did I forget an anniversary? Belma! What's going on? Are we celebrating something? Yes. What happened to your face? What did you do, did you do make-up again? I had botox. Pardon? I had botox. Do you like... Do you like it? Er... Yes. It looks like... It looks different. Is it going to look like... That? What do you mean? You didn't like it, did you? - No, I did... - You didn't... I did, how could I not? It just that... I mean... looks different. Let me look. It's just like... just like swollen a bit but maybe because of candlelight. Yes, swollen... I got fillers too. The doctor said oedema can occur but it'll pass. - So, it'll pass? - Yes. - It won't stay this way? - No. - You're sure? - Yes. It's just that, God forbid, like you had a stroke. What are you saying? But it's going to pass. I mean, that's what the doctor thinks, you said. Belma, are you crying? No. Are you sure? I'm not crying, why would I? Okay then, let's eat, look at these delicious things you made. Come on, let's eat before they get cold. I'm hungry, hungry as a wolf. Belma, I'm just very tired. You don't want it? Is it okay if we just go to sleep? Good night. Hi, sorry to bother you. I... I need to ask you something. My face is getting solid. I can't do mimics in any way and... I think my smile is also broken. Did you drink a lot of water like I told you? - You didn't do any exercise also? - No, I didn't, I did drink... Belma, we said that there could be oedema. Those swellings are oedema. Also since it was your first procedure your face might not get used to the muscle movement botox causes. Let's wait for a few days. It's not serious, no need to panic. It's not serious, isn't... No, it's not, I assure you, however if you want we can do a blood test to set your mind at ease. Miss... Miss? Here is your order. How much? Er... 30 lira. Okay, keep the change, thanks. Keep it. It happens to me for the first time. You said it wasn't serious but it keeps getting worse. I'm sorry to say this Belma but according to your blood test you have developed a reaction to one of the substances we have injected. Even if we dissolve the fillers it seems impossible to return the symmetry of your face to the way it was. - How? - However, still there is a method that will make you happy. - What is it? - It's a brand new technique. We'll do a face transplant. - Face transplant? - Yes. Look, in 10 days you would have a new and healthy face of your choosing. You can pick up where you left off in your life. Think of it as a rebirth. I don't want a new face, I want my old face. Don't think like that. I'll bring you a catalogue. You'll change your mind, you'll see. - Belma! - My face! My face. I agree with the other jurors. This combination doesn't fit your body shape. Those pants and that scarf should not combine together. It caught my attention, you got your lip filler. It's nice, but your eyebrows also need a bit of touching, right honey? So, I'm overall looking at you and I give 5 out of 10. - You need to... - Don't watch this nonsense. It gives you nightmares. Come on, let's sleep. Get up! Belma! I'm waiting! PLASTIC DREAM
