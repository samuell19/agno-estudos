You said it's 10 days till your due date, right?. Yes. But the baby hasn't moved since yesterday. - So what do you say?. - Nothing to worry about. The heartbeat's quite normal. Let's wait till you go into labour. - Don't worry. Everything's on track. - Thank you. Take care now. - Quick! - Hang on, Neriman! Hang on! - Why isn't it moving?. - C'mon now, Inci.

I have a few things to finish, then I'll be on my way. Come along around 8 pm. I'll be there as soon as I'm done. It's the restaurant on the right on the way to Sariyer, right?. Right. Onur will pick you up anyway. No need, sweetie. I know the place. OK, wish me luck. Don't worry, darling. It'll be great. Love you. Bye. Me too. - OK, get yourself ready then. - Shit! Don't you dare tidy up, mum. You already have, haven't you?. OK, mum, you angel. Bye. Centrum Productions. Yes. Till 7 pm. Didn't your agency give the address?. - I'm here for the film audition. - Here you are. Sorry to keep you waiting, but... No, no problem. You'll have the cover photo tomorrow. And Ozgur will set aside all day tomorrow... And here he is! Welcome. How's it going?. - Good. Forgive me for being late - Hello. Ayse. Good to see you. - I've been dying to meet you. - Great. Why don't you start right away?. And I'll go pick up your mother. Thanks, Onur. This way. Hello, welcome. Can you introduce yourself please?. My name's Deniz Usman. I was born in Ankara on September 1, 1977. I was born in Ankara on September 1, 1977. I lived there till 2002. At 14, I started acting and drama classes... ...at the Ankara Arts Theatre. After moving to lstanbul, I started working for a magazine. Then when I got my own studio I turned to more individual work. I'm 168 cm. and weigh around 58 kg, I think. You've had a lot of success internationally. But you also shoot magazine covers, you do more commercial stuff. - Which is you?. - Both, actually. If I'm able to connect with my subject... ...then any kind of work is rewarding. Do you speak French?. Yes. I haven't for a long time, but I can try. But no, I don't need an actress who speaks perfect French. I need someone who speaks French with a Turkish accent. Otherwise I would find a French actress. That's why I'm here. OK. There are many photographers... ...taking all kinds of different photos. But your work stands out on its own. What's your secret?. What makes you different?. I can't actually say I have a secret. I think where I'm lucky is that my father was a photographer. Here she is! Mum, I'll say it one last time. don't talk about work! OK, son! You've said it 50 times! - Good evening, hello. - Welcome, dear. Sorry I'm a bit late. How do you do?. - My dad, Sadik. My mum, Gulsen. - Great to meet you. Hello. OK, let's sit down. - Honey, you wouldn't believe what happened - Wait, darling. You can tell me later. Excuse me! Oh, my boy! - It's wonderful. - Welcome. Thanks. Neriman Teyze?. Would you allow me the honour of escorting you around the exhibition?. - All right. Go on then. - I'll be along in a bit. How long will you be staying in lstanbul?. We're heading back tomorrow. Work won't wait, as you know. - Right. Dad, wine?. - Talking of work... ...when Burak said you're an actress it rather put us off to be honest. Really?. Why?. Don't misunderstand, we're open-minded... Mum, can I have your glass please?. Don't drink too much, son. You're driving. Don't worry about me. I have the most gorgeous driver. Are all actors' lives chaotic?. No. But they're up and down to be honest. - Well, it's not good for family life. - Shall we order?. Shall we order our fish, mum?. - Want to look at the menu, dad?. - But luckily you seem to be sensible. Mum, we weren't going to discuss this. Son, you won't let me say a word! OK, I'll shut up. Let's drink to the new store in Moscow. You made the right decision, dear. - About what?. - Why is no one looking after us?. - About acting. - Excuse me! Sorry. - Can we have the menu please?. - Well, you're right to give up acting. Thank you. Dad, what are you having?. If it isn't farmed, I'll have the sea bass. - Mum, you?. - Striped red mullet. Deniz, what will you have?. To be honest, I don't see why you think that. - But it's the season for mullet, dear! - No. I mean about me and acting. Just today I went for a big audition. There's a good chance it'll work out. And if it does, we'll be shooting mostly in France. As it happens, I have no intention of giving up acting. Sorry, I have to get this call. For a meet-the-parents dinner, it doesn't get better, Zeynep. But there's this crazy thing going on. I'm about to lose it. They think I am going to give up acting. How do I know?. Sure, it's a subject to be discussed with Burak. She said "We were rather put off to hear you're an actress to be honest. It's no profession for a woman who's starting a family to be honest. We have our own views to be honest. Well done for giving up to be honest." As you can see, Zeynep, I'm in deep shit to be honest. Umm, I'll call you back later, OK?. - Should I send flowers or what?. - What's done is done. - Why did you lie to them?. - Move over to the right, Deniz. We have to take a turn ahead. - Why did you say I'll give up acting?. - Well, what was I supposed to do?. They've been nagging me for years. Why do you think they haven't met you till now?. Burak decided on my behalf and went and persuaded his parents. So these things happen, right, Burak?. If you would have told me, couldn't we have persuaded them together?. Persuaded them of what, Deniz?. Their attitude is obvious. - How are you going to persuade them?. - This is my career, Burak! OK?. And I don't plan to give it up. - Use the mirrors, will you! - I am using the mirrors! - Sure! - Don't change the subject! Call that using the mirrors, huh?. OK, so you lied. Then what?. As I won't be opening a store anywhere, what are you planning to do?. - What's wrong with opening one?. - What?. - What do you mean "what"?. Why not?. - You have to be joking. - No. - You don't know what you're saying. You don't know what you're doing! Today it's the French film, tomorrow... - It could be the chance of my... - It's always the chance of your life! Everything's the chance of your life! Whatever kind of life that is. Whatever theatre doesn't do for you. - You're doing it again. - What?. Whenever an opportunity comes up you try to get in the way. What are you talking about?. Give me a break, for God's sake! No, the pay's bad. No, it's out of town. No, it's this. So it's my fault you're a failure, huh?. I've prevent you from getting an Oscar. - You think I'm a failure?. - Just take a look at yourself, Deniz. Just take a look at yourself, Deniz. If it's not the chance of your life, it's a French film. Wake up, Deniz! What are you doing, Deniz?. Where are you going?. Deniz, come here! What is the problem for God"s sake?. Now I'll go, "One, two, three!" and a bird will fly out of here. But you have to smile. Here we go. One, two, three! - Excuse me, whose exhibition is this?. - I think he's over there. Welcome to you all. These photographs here were taken... ...by a studio artist, a professional. - I'm hanging up, Burak. - Deniz. They're some of the many he took during a career of more than 40 years. In fact, they're the few that have survived of thousands. - Burak, what is it?. - l"ve parked in the worst spot. Shit will fly any second. Can you please come out?. I can see you. OK, I'm coming. Foto Turgut was a tiny studio in the Gazi district of Ankara. And Yilmaz Turgut... ...took photos there every day for more than 40 years. Ten people a day used to come to the studio. That makes 70 people a week. It means seeing 300 faces a month, or 3650 a year. Or 36,500 every 10 years. After a while, you stop feeling alone at all. Because as time goes on everyone becomes a familiar face. When we lost him around a year ago... ...I felt that staging an exhibition like this would be a way of thanking him... ...on behalf of myself and of everyone in the photographs. Thanks to you all for coming. Deniz. Look, don't let us part like this. I'm flying to Russia in the morning. - Don't send me off like this, please. - Have a good trip. Look, OK, I got a bit annoyed. I'm sorry. OK?. Burak, if you think like your parents, we should talk. If I did, I wouldn't be with you in the first place. But when you... When you start talking about "the chance of your life"... ...well, I get upset. Understand me a little. Aren't we the chance of our lives for one another?. - Let's talk later. - OK. OK. Give me a kiss then. This only happens because I love you so much. You know that, don't you?. Really?. Really. Have a good trip. - Zeynep! - I'm in here. God damn, Zeynep! Didn't I tell you I couldn't walk in these heels?. - See?. Broken! - Good! Serves you right. - How come you never called back?. - You won't believe what happened. I spoke to you, looked in the mirror and the woman was right behind me. - You're kidding! And?. - She heard everything. I blew it! - Good! She heard for herself. - Forget that. I'm going to show you something. Take a good look, OK?. Hey, is this you?. I think so. Where did you get it?. Ozgur, don't be angry, but if you can come back sometime.. -...before that shop's rented. I.. Huh?. - I will, I will. Look, I'm busy the next few weeks... ...but I'll come after that. Promise, OK?. All right, all right. - Son! - Mum. You've made me so happy, Ozgur. But your dad too. Your dad too. You know what?. If he can really see us out there... - OK, mum. OK, sweetheart. OK. - He must be so proud of you. He must be so proud. OK, c'mon now. Don't be late. Call me when you arrive, OK?. - I will, but when I get home. - OK, when you get home. I can't work the mobile thing. Mum, I want to ask you something. Remember a photo of me... ...when I was around eight taken at a place called Foto Turgut?. I'm in a flowery dress, my hair's shoulder-length. - You mean your uncle Turgut?. - OK. Never mind, mum. - Listen, I'm hanging up, OK?. - OK, honey. - Good night. - Good night. Why did I bother asking?. Hey, everyone just loved the exhibition. Wait till the magazine cover's out and people will go really wild. - Look, I don't plan to stick around. - OK. What time are we meeting tomorrow?. - Why?. - What do you mean "why"?. To shoot the cover, right?. You're getting dementia at your age?. - What's wrong?. - Can we get out of here?. - Ozgur, what's wrong?. - I need some air. OK, OK. C'mon. Oh my God, what's going on?. You OK?. Watch the stairs. Don't rush. I'll turn on the light, then go up. OK, OK. - Feeling a bit better?. - I'm fine, I'm fine. - Grab hold of me if you like. - No, it's OK. I'm fine going slow. - What happened all of a sudden?. - I just felt a bit dizzy. OK, you lie down and rest right now. I'll be here anyway. - Don't be crazy. Go back to your place. - No, I'm staying. - There's no need. I'm fine, I tell you. - Are you sure?. Positive, really. - OK. - There's a load to do tomorrow anyway. - OK. If anything happens, call me. - OK. - Whatever the time. Good night then. - Thanks. Good night. Medical Testing Centre Head to the right a bit. - Don't move. Just a second. - Dad, you be in it too. Son, don't move. Hold on. Thank you very much. Do go ahead. - Can you get home all right?. - Yes. Off you go then. Show me. Yusuf, has the Turbo gum come?. The kids from the next street took the lot, Ozgur. - Hey, kiddy! Showing off are you?. - Bug off to your own street! This street is ours! That's our store! You nabbed all the Turbos! What's it to you?. - Bug off or I'll smash your face! - If you can catch me. Come here and say that! Two scoops. Not too much, please! That's quite enough. Ozgur! That bike was supposed to be your birthday present! - Your dad couldn't wait, could he?. - Can I ride around a bit more?. OK. Take your dad his lunch then, And grab the yoghurt on your way in. Are you here?. Wait, just a second. Hey, what are you doing?. Didn't I say no raw dough, huh?. - Here. Be careful. - OK, see you. Goodbye. Ah, just look at you! Didn't we tell you to keep away?. Hey, what's going on?. - If only we had more time. - Keep at it till you're happy. - I'll handle the other side. - Thanks. Eren, any chance of putting off the other side for half an hour?. - OK, no problem. - You're wonderful. Thanks. Perfect. - Excuse me a moment! - Yes?. Do you think I could speak to the exhibitor?. Dad, your lunch... Ah! Do you know who this girl is?. - Why do you ask?. - I think it's me. Well, it's a lot like me as a girl, except I have no memory of the photo. So you don't know if you're the girl in the photo?. I know it seems crazy, but I have no childhood photos. - That's why I can't be sure. - Are you from Ankara?. - Yes. - Where did you live in Ankara?. You Ankara guys meet... ...and always end up knowing each other from somewhere! We lived in Cankaya. Is that where your father's studio was?. - In the Gazi district actually. - That's where my grandfather lived! Grandpa's sweet wafer! Dad, we'll fetch you both tonight and go back to our place. Off you go to work now. Don't go outside without your hat. OK, sweetheart?. Do you have to make A ceremony out of it everytime?. How come you get all the luck?. - Sorry, what was your name?. - Deniz. I'm Onur. Good to meet you. OK. Now Deniz, how about we take a few photos of you here, right now?. - You mean, with my hair like...?. - Sure. It's great. Perfect. In front of your childhood photo for instance. And suppose we use them later for a magazine cover?. As publicity for the exhibition. - I don't really know. - Thank you big time! You saved my life. - Hello?. - What should I do?. Just stand in front of your photo. Like this?. Weird, isn't it?. I have zero memory of a photo like this. Maybe you never came to pick it up. That's why you don't remember. Shall I tell you something else you don't remember?. - Yes?. - While you were having this taken... ...I was there too. Do we know each other?. I'm really sorry. If I could find the thing. Hello, Zeynep?. I'm on my way. I have to rush. My memory's terrible. Can you tell me straight out?. If you come to the studio tomorrow, I'll give you a copy of the photo... ...and we'll have a chance to talk. Onur, bring me a card, will you?. - Thank you again, Deniz. - Thanks, Onur Bey. - Nice to meet you, Ozgur Bey. - You too. Bye! Grandpa, what are they doing?. Shooting a film, dear. Mum, do you shoot films with dad?. Our film days are over, dear. Now c'mon, eat your dinner. Grandpa, when I grow up I'm going to be an actor like you. Deniz, eat up if you're going to. Otherwise go straight to bed. OK. Mum, can you move over a bit?. One... Two... - Shall we shoot a film?. - Huh?. Grandpa's little outlaw! Come here, c'mon! C'mon! That's it. Now, Ozgur, let's listen to that heart of yours. Get better soon, lad. - You too. - Ah, you too! You too. - Ozgur?. Does it hurt a lot, dear?. - Aha. Oh, sweetie! Get up and let's go. No, no. You must stay. - Really, why?. - You said there was nothing serious?. - He has an irregular heartbeat. - It's his heart?. We need to do an ECG. We should consult a cardiologist. - It's his heart?. - Yes. Come on. The man can't even look after himself! How many times have I said not to let the girl out! No, it's over. No more grandpa! She's not going! But we have to leave her with him till school starts! - Take a leave then! - How?. I don't have any days left! - Leave the job then. - Leave?. Nice! - Who'll pay the school fees then?. - Great! So it's snide comments now! - Zeynep! It's me, it's me! - Really?. - Yes! - Well?. Plus the guy knows me. But I can't figure out where from. - Ozgur Turgut's telephone?. - Can I speak to Ozgur?. - I'm his manager, Onur. Who's calling?. - I need to speak to him in person. Anything to add?. If not, I'm done. - No, you've done a great job. - What's it about?. Can I help?. - I can't give you any details. - Can you hold on a second?. - Hello?. - Ozgur Bey, hello. - I have Dr Erdem on the line. - OK. I'm here. - Ozgur Bey?. - Hello. How are you?. Fine thanks. We've scheduled you in. In order for full recovery, we need to hospitalize you for a while. I see. How long do I have to stay?. At least a week, Ozgur. Well, is Wednesday OK?. Let's not delay it. Tomorrow is best. - OK, thanks. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - What's it?. - Can you cancel this week's schedule?. - Why?. - I'll explain later. Forget it. - What am I supposed to tell people?. - Make up some excuses. I'm out of here. I'm not taking those pills! Dad, what does 'shooting a film' mean?. - Shooting a film?. - Aha. Now look. The button's here. But taking a photograph doesn't mean just pressing the button. If you know how to look from the right angle... ...you'll find beauty in everything. And if you capture that beauty, then you've taken a good photograph. Off you go then. There you go! Now to somewhere nicer. Ozgur Turgut. Oh my God! The guy's gorgeous! Don't laugh! Ankara-born photographer. Awards. Blah, blah, blah... Look, sure he's not kidding you?. He saw you had no memory. "How did you get into photography??' "My dad was actually a photographer so I've been close to it all my life. But I'd say my real interest began... ...after a bike accident I had as a boy." What?. What did you say?. - He had a bike accident as a boy. - That's him?. Why didn't I twig?. - Twig what?. Who?. - I don't believe it! This way, precious. Let's sit on that bench there. Good girl! - Here, a secret notebook for you. - Like my secret box?. More secret than that. You must write in the notebook everything you feel in your heart. Minds forget, hearts never do. Can I write about the boy with the red bike?. You little rascal! Well, they say great romances start with a fight. Yours started with an accident, didn't it?. - Grandpa, how does love happen?. - No one honestly knows, Deniz. But there are certain signs of course. Your heart races, for example. You always, always want to see and to be with that person. They mean the world to you. You care about nothing else. - Were you in love with granny?. - I'm still in love with her. There's no knowing if it's fate, destiny or coincidence... ...but the heart goes and chooses one person. When I first saw your mother... ...I said to myself, "I'm going to marry that woman." Sometimes you know at first sight that person is your destiny. Sometimes you search for a lifetime and never find the one. Wow. Girls, we leave for Ankara tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. from Taksim. - No one's to forget anything. - OK. - That was directed at me. - Of course it was! I'm off to the guy's studio to pick up that photo. - Want to come too?. - No. Why would l?. Ooph! Fine then. You're always such a spoilsport. - Hello. - Come in. - This place is so beautiful. - Thanks. - Is this where you work?. - Yes. Well, live actually. - Look, can we drop the formal 'you'?. - OK. Perfect. - Do have... - Did you...?. Sorry... Did you take all of them?. Yes. Except that one. That's you, isn't it?. - You remembered in the end, huh?. - Yes. More than that in fact. - Let's say I read about it. - What's that?. My diary. Look, I'll show you something. - Look. - What, here?. Yes. "l finally met the boy with the red bike. I jumped in front of the bike just like they do in the movies. It really hurt, but that's OK." How do you mean?. You jumped out on purpose?. Seems so. I've been plagued by guilt for years and you jumped out on purpose, huh?. I'm really sorry. - Tea?. - Sure. How come you have no childhood photos?. They got lost. Well, when we moved some of the boxes got lost. All the photos, albums and stuff were in those boxes. When you have no childhood photos, you even forget what you looked like. That's why it was so weird seeing that photo yesterday. You're really lucky. I bet you have hundreds of photos. - Thousands. - Wow! What do you do?. I'm an actress. Right. I should have guessed. I'm not as good as I was as a kid, but well, I try. - Where do you act?. - We have a theatre group. I sometimes go to auditions. Films, TV series and stuff. Actually there's a chance I'll act in a film any time now. But we'll see. That's great. What kind of film?. A romance. I don't know if I'll get the part, but I really want it. - I reckon you will. - Seriously?. - I have a hunch. - God, I hope so. You seem to pick out really special people. And this is one of them. - How many years has it been?. - Twenty-five. Twenty-five. But your eyes haven't changed at all. They're still the same. He's looking really deep. So warm. - Want to meet him?. - How do you mean?. Well, the captain is a great cook and he is not far away. We could go. - What, now?. - How about next time we meet?. - Sure. - Twenty-five years later. OK. Let's do it. Agh! Sorry! Hold on tight! - What?. - Hold on tight! - Hey! - Captain?. - Ozgur! Welcome! - Thanks. How are you?. Fine, raring to go! - How about you?. - Good. Great, thanks. - Deniz. - Hello. How do you do?. - Nice to meet you. - You too. Thanks. Sit down, sit down. Just a minute. It's the first time you've come with a girl. And you've struck gold. Don't let her go, OK?. We're childhood friends, captain. From ages ago. Even better. Sit down. - What are you drinking?. - What will you have?. Raki?. - OK. Some mezzes... - I'll handle that, don't worry. Thanks, captain. - Where did you go to school?. - Kolej. You?. Deneme. I have loads of friends from Deneme! - Like who?. - Irem, Aysegul, Idil... - You must know Alp. Tall, fair... - Curly... - Right. Curly Alp. - Yes, I know Alp. Here you go, guys. - Thank you. - Thanks Captain. I was at university with Alp after that. But I've no idea what he did later. - Neither do l. - What did you do at the university?. Uni.. I was already working for my dad, so I wasn't that well prepared. And then, to be honest, I didn't really make a go of it. So you wanted to be a photographer right from the start. Yes. Not quite from the start, but let's say so. Want some water?. - I'll drink it straight. - Here you are, the mezzes. - Thanks, captain. - Thank you. I'll leave it to you to serve. OK, thanks a lot. - Thank you. - It all looks great. Weird, isn't it, that we never ran into each other in Ankara?. - Maybe we did. - Maybe. In that case... ...to our childhood meeting and that old photo I found years later. Your lad with the bike still hasn't ridden past?. - I'm not waiting for him. - Of course you aren't! - I'm just teasing. Now on your feet! - Where are we going?. To have a beautiful picture taken of you, huh?. - I don't want to! I'm staying here. - Staying here, huh?. You just come here! Alone for all the world to see It just isn't right How could you go so heartlessly?. You can't just leave like that Ozgur?. What are you doing, son?. Didn't you promise not to run around?. - Look, you'll get all sweaty. - Mum, please! I'm so bored. - Can't I go out?. - Turn that off. Bored, are you?. Listen, if you promise not to run, you can take your dad his lunch. OK?. - A man's word! - A man's word. OK, off you go then. - Hurray! - Not so fast though! Hey, what's up?. Lost your guts without the bike?. Now, turn your head a little to the right. I know you're bored, but it'll be over in a minute. Look, like this. That'll come out perfect. Now I'll go "One, two, three!" and a bird will fly out of here. OK?. But you have to smile too. Here we go then. One, two, three! Smile a bit. Smile, come on now. Dad, your lunch... Ozgur, what have you done, son?. I'm sorry, Kemal. You clean up the mess there. Come and I'll write you a ticket. - You come along too, dear. - OK. - Shall we shoot a film?. - Aha. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Raki?. No, I shouldn't drink any more. Enough is enough. OK. - Where are you performing in Ankara?. - At the Sinasi Theatre. - You know it?. - Yes. - How long will you be there?. - Three weeks or so. It isn't clear yet what happens after that. Ozgur, can we go?. It's just we're leaving really early tomorrow. Sure. - Captain, can we get... - Hey, where are you going?. You think I'd let you go without some halva?. - Captain, another time?. - It's now or never. - OK, let's have some. - Are you sure?. Sure I'm sure! - OK, captain. You win again. - Excuse me. - Hello?. - Darling?. - Burak?. - I'm just found the time to call. You should have seen the crowd at the opening. How are you?. - I'm fine. - Any news about the film?. - Nope. They haven't called yet. - Right. So it didn't work out. It's only been two days, Burak! They'll call. Just wait a bit. Well, they'd have called if they wanted you. I know you get mad at me, but I'm right every time. - Here you go again. I'm hanging up. - Go ahead if you want to be pigheaded. - I'm hanging up, Burak! - Have you been drinking, huh?. You sound weird. Are you out?. Where are you?. I'm at the Academy Awards, Burak. OK, bye. Thanks. - Everything OK?. - Yes. Fine. Your boyfriend?. Yes. Have you been together long?. Yes. Longer than long. You?. Do you have a girlfriend?. No. The captain forgot the forks. I don't think I can get on that bike in this state. My head's spinning like crazy. - You think I can?. - No idea. - No, look, we'll take a cab. - OK. Hello there. - Deniz, where do you live?. - Umm, Cihangir. Can we go first to Cihangir, then on to Balat?. Deniz. Deniz, we've arrived in Cihangir. Deniz?. Deniz?. Let's just go straight to Balat. With your face on my chest You drifted off again As dawn slipped into your room The sun spilled into your hair For the first time this morning my shattered life is whole Just one night with you and I'm complete Even if I vanished, if I saw my end Even if I had a taste of death, Still I wouldn't be defeated Even if I faded away, if I knew my end Even if I had a taste of death, Still I wouldn't be defeated All my victories are for you I rose quietly from your side I stepped into the new day Your breath is gold dust in the air I'm a stranger to this feeling For the first time this morning my lost soul is calm and at peace Last night I was born again with you Even if I vanished, if I saw my end Even if I had a taste of death, Still I wouldn't be defeated Even if I faded away, if I knew my end Even if I had a taste of death, Still I wouldn't be defeated Even if I faded away, if I knew my end Even if I had a taste of death, Still I wouldn't be defeated Even if I faded away, if I knew my end Even if I had a taste of death, Still I wouldn't be defeated All my victories are for you - Grandpa! - I guess he's inside. Dad! Dad?. Dad?. Is he asleep?. Deniz. We won't be seeing Grandpa again. How come?. Because... - Because he's gone somewhere else. - No, he hasn't! Grandpa's in there. Deniz. No. Grandpa isn't here any longer. - In that case, I'm going with him. - No, no. Don't say things like that. - Have a good day, Yilmaz. - Welcome, Yusuf. - Heard about the funeral?. - Whose funeral?. Well, he lived in the next street. Kemal. - The actor?. - Yes, he's passed away. - Oh no! - Afraid so. I took his granddaughter's photo only two days ago. God rest his soul. Ozgur! Shit! Shit! Shit! - Where are you?. I was worried sick! - I forgot my phone was on silent. - I'm on my way. Don't go without me! - We're waiting! - OK. I have to get my bag. - I've got it. - You're a darling. - Where are you?. Don't ask. I'll tell you later. OK, bye! - I'm here, I'm here! Sorry! - Where the hell were you, Deniz?. - Hey, I'm here. Don't ask. - No, tell me now! - Sorry, everyone! - Before you get on! - I stayed at Ozgur's. Or so it seems. - What?.! I'm really sorry, really. - How are you doing, Deniz?. - Fine, not bad. You?. So what kept you?. I crashed at a friend's. I guess I overslept. Morning! Hey, why are you sleeping there?. I'll give you some good news to wake you up. They called from the magazine. They're crazy for the cover photos. - Where's Deniz?. - Who's Deniz?. Deniz! Is she gone?. So sorry for the trouble I caused. Thanks for everything. Forgive me, Deniz. - Was Deniz that... - Oh God! Deniz, the cover girl! Hey, you snake in the grass! Onur, my bike's at the captain's. Can you pick it up?. - And let me have the car, OK?. - What do you want the car for?. Unbelievable! No answering, acting, all stuck-up. - Hello?. - Ozgur Bey?. - Yes, speaking?. - You're due to be hospitalized today. Dr Erdem asked me to confirm with you. Hospitalized?. OK. Let me call back in a few minutes. Thank you. Goodbye. Who was that?. Guess I should be saying get well. You're going to be hospitalized. - What's going on, Ozgur?. - Look, it's nothing serious. The other night you passed out. You cancel the whole week's work. You're going hospital. And it's nothing serious. - I'm not going to be hospitalized. Really. - So what was that call about then?. - Well... - Look, I'm worried now! But there's nothing to worry about. I'm not going to hospital either. Where's the car?. - If you want the car, first you talk. - Sit down. We got in the cab and that's all I remember. I mean, I was totally out. Then when I open my eyes I find 20 missed calls from you. I wake up, I'm in his room. Like so. That's all. - So you're saying nothing happened. - It didn't! Stop it, for goodness sake! Is he as gorgeous for real as he is in that picture?. Huh?. Ooph, Zeynep! Yes, Deniz?. Burak, how are you?. Fine. Having lunch. You?. Still at the Oscars?. I'm in Bolu. On my way to Ankara for the tour. I completely forgot. Sorry, I can't keep up with you. Burak, I'm sorry I hung up on you last night. OK?. But we have problems. You know that. Get back and we'll talk face to face. But you'll be on tour when I get back, won't you?. That's the whole issue anyway. Right, honey?. I have to go. The minibus is leaving. - Talk to you soon. - Bye. Ozgur! C'mon, aren't you going to pick up your report card?. Yes, I am! Don't forget to stop by your dad's on the way! OK! In truth, I am that merry wanderer of the night. I jest to Oberon... - What's going on?. - I'm practising for the theatre exam. Ankara Arts Theatre. Young talents wanted! - Inci! - Yes?. - Do you know about this?. - What's that?. Missy here is preparing for the theatre exam. So who's taking the exam for science high school?. I don't want to do science! I want to be an actress. Fine. So let's take you out of school. We won't waste the money. Right, Inci?. Since missy wants to rough it as an actress. - Well, if you didn't shout... - Don't make me shout then! - Forget AAT! Put it out of your head! - No, I won't! - What did you say?. - I'm taking the exam! - Deniz! - What's got into her?. - She's growing up! - Great! We inherited her from your father. Dad, it's me! Come here now. I was expecting you. Close your eyes. I have a surprise for you. Hold out your hands. Open your eyes. Dad. Thank you. It's really great. Your present for the report card. Like it?. Aha. It's really great. Caner. Will we have guitars like that one day?. - You can today if you want. - How do you mean?. - If you have the guts. - What does that mean?. - Hey, who threw that?. - C'mon, forget it. - No way! Who threw that, huh?. - It's OK. Let it go. Let me just wash my hands. Just keep quiet. Here, hold this. So here we are, at last. - Zeynep, I don't believe it! - Hey, what's going on?. - Out, quick. Here, take my bag. - Hand it over. - How come?. - You forgot this. - Did you... Come to bring me this?. - You said it meant a lot to you. Plus I forgot to give you my number. Thank you so much. - Really. - It's nothing. We're about to start rehearsals any minute now. So... - Maybe afterwards... - Maybe when I'm done... - If you want to have a drink.. - That would be nice. See you later then. See you. - What's going on?. - Take this, take this. He's watching, he's watching. I don't believe it. I've got it, I've got it. - How long is it... - Now I'm here... You first. I was going to ask how long it's been since you were last here. And I was going to say, now I'm here I realize how much I miss Ankara. My dad had this theory. He used to say that for any person from Ankara, lstanbul is like someone else's child. When it smiles you love it, when it cries you want to run away. That's exactly it, I guess. - I was a pain yesterday. I'm so sorry. - It's me who should be sorry. I mean, when you didn't wake up I couldn't figure out what to do. - So what will you do in Ankara?. - See to my dad's studio. It needs tidying up before we rent the place. Tenants have to be found. My mum has to like them and so on. It must be hard for your mum. It's not easy. But she's a strong woman. - How are your folks doing?. - Fine. They're fine. Infact, mum's probably cooked tons and is expecting me right now. OK. Let's go then. - Thanks a lot for everything. - You're welcome. By the way, it's our opening night tomorrow. Maybe you'd like to come. - It's not that boring, really! - It couldn't possibly be boring anyway. - See you. - See you. Hey, it's OK. Let it go. Deniz?. - What's the matter, honey?. - Nothing. - Are you sure?. - Positive. I'm fine. All right, honey. They all laughed at me to begin with. "How can you get by selling creams??' If I just stuck to that pension, I tell you. - Pass the pickles, sis. - Here. But you force all the neighbours to buy the stuff. - People run now when they see you. - C'mon! I don't force them! The woman has a face my bum and still says no! That's forcing her?. Sis... - How's Burak, Deniz?. - Fine, uncle. They've opened a new store in Russia. He's gone there for that. - Russia?. Isn't it dodgy over there?. - In what way?. - "You want shower with me??' That story. - Ooph! No way! Burak's not into that. - We're coming to the play, aren't we?. - Absolutely! I'll give you the invites in a minute. I tell you, I want a grandchild. I want a grandchild. But it seems you have no wedding plans, what with you still acting. C'mon! Why would they get married?. They're happy as they are. If only you'd studied pharmacy. Your uncle's handing over his place. You could've worked there. Mum, I just don't believe it. Still?. Mum's pharmacy fantasy never ends. Don't suppose it ever will either. Ignore what she says. Everyone knows about your play. Really?. Remember you were in two episodes of that TV series last year?. - Anyone who didn't watch got hell. - You're kidding! - Mum?. - No one's had any beans. - We'll have some now. - Nor have you had any of this. Ah, you've ground to a halt on me! - Orhan, you've filled yourself up. - C'mon, sis. - Really, you have. - Sis! You haven't even touched this. If Omer were here, he'd have polished off the lot. What's going on?. She's been like this lately. Won't stop talking about Omer. - Shall I go see if she's OK?. - Wait, wait. Here, I've brought dessert. - I'm done. It was delicious, sis. - Oh no! You don't have any plates. - Here you are, your tea. - Thanks. Ozgur. You know I find it hard going up and down stairs these days?. Well, could you perhaps see to that studio tomorrow, huh?. Sure. Some people called today in fact. They're coming over tomorrow morning. - You won't leave right away, will you?. - No. Smile! Hey, thanks. This camera is only worth one guitar actually. - But I couldn't do that to you. Here. - Thanks! Ozgur, what's this...?. Where's that guitar come from?. It's Caner's. Ozgur, look. Jump about like this and you go bright red all over. Why are you doing it, son?. Ozgur?. Neriman! What does the doctor say, Yilmaz?. What can he say, Neriman?. Same as all the other doctors. - He'll suffer all his life. - Shh! OK, OK. Dad. Where's my guitar?. - Mum! - Come here. - Look, I found the wedding dress. - Mum, where did that come from?. Come here. Look. Come here now. Look, we'll take in the sides a bit. And then it'll fit perfectly. Nothing's definite yet. Oh, c'mon! He's introduced his parents. What do you think?. Beautiful! Will your dad come to the wedding too?. Look, don't let him come. Whatever you do! Mum, are you OK?. Huh?. Burak's a good boy. Good at his job. And he loves you. I know, mum. Why are you saying this?. I just am! It isn't easy to find someone you can trust. I was in love with your dad. And look what happened! I, actually... Good thing you reminded me. I haven't hung up the laundry yet. - Read it! What's written here?. - It's just the girl imagining things! - lmagining things?. She saw you! - Look, stop making a scene! How could you do this to your own daughter?. Mum?. Mum, what are you doing?. - Morning! - Morning! Come here for another kiss. You were already born by now. A tiny, lopsided thing! - Mum, I can't stay for breakfast. - How do you mean?. I'm expected at rehearsals right away. What, on an empty stomach?. No, I'll get something there. So can I take the car?. They keys are in the box. You shouldn't go like this. Don't worry, mum. I'll see you anyway at the theatre tonight, OK?. - Ah, my love! - I guess I've grown up, mum. You've grown up?. C'mon! You haven't grown up one bit. You're every bit the child you were. Still hiding things from me. Now cut the cake. - What does that mean?. - It means you're in a state. Why would I be in a state, mum?. Those guys will be at the studio in 15 minutes. - Really?. OK. - I mustn't be late. OK?. - Off you go then. - Thanks. - Dad! - Son! Alone for all the world to see. It just isn't right How could you go so heartlessly?. You can't just... Anyone there?. Yes?. Hello there. I came about the rental. Is now a good time?. - What do you plan to do businesswise?. - Open an internet cafe. Ozgur! Come on, son. Let's go, son. OK, dad. - I'll just dust those, then I'll come. - All right. - Ozgur! I'm locking the door. - OK. - Hello. - Hello there. Alone for all the world to see It just isn't right How could you go so heartlessly?. You can't just leave like that I thought I'd forget, darling But I've been longing for you Tonight's our last night here. The road's now taking us to lstanbul. But our hearts will never leave Ankara! Have a good time, guys! Hey, it looks great. - Hello. - Hello, guys. - There's live music, right?. - Just finished, I'm afraid. - You're kidding! - But we have a party on. The DJ's taking over right now. - What do you think?. There's a DJ... - No, we want live music. - We could check out Kibele. - Right, that's an idea. Thanks. - What am I going to do?. - What do you want to do?. No idea. What would you do in my position?. - You're asking the wrong person, Deniz. - Zeynep, please say something. You're asking what I'd do if I were you, right?. So you're me, I'm you... ...and Burak's my man. OK?. Anyway, things are great with Burak. Just a few problems with his parents, but nothing that can't be fixed. Then one day Burak and I have a fight. And I just happen to run into my childhood love that very day. But unfortunately that snivelling seven-year-old... ...has turned into the most gorgeous, charismatic, talented, enigmatic guy. And he's made me feel things no one's ever made me feel before. Nor have I ever looked at anyone that way before. Thanks. That's really helpful. Thanks. Sorry, but what was I supposed to say?. I don't know. You could say, "Get a grip, Deniz," for example. "Get a grip. Sure, Ozgur may be your childhood love." "He may really turn you on." "You may feel like you're about to have a heart attack whenever you see him." "But you've been with Burak for ages. He's never upset you, cheated on you." Do you think I'm happy with Burak?. Can I make a person happy if I'm not happy being with him?. - He really loves you. - No, he doesn't! What kind of love is that?. Can you love something you don't feel or understand?. Besides, if he loved you, why would he want you to give up... ...the things that make you who you are?. Huh?. Look, don't cry. Anyway, just live how you want to live. Huh?. I'll fool him. That's all. Tell us in one word something you lost which really mattered to you. - You have three seconds. - My treasure box. Welcome to the Ankara Arts Theatre, Deniz! - Look, my mum's here. - Where?. - Mum, my uncle, my aunt. - Ah, OK. I see them. How come they're in row three?. Well, I guess they'll see better. Ah! Zeynep, Zeynep! Happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Deniz. Thanks, everyone. - Deniz Usman?. - Yes. - We have roses. And a card. - I wonder who from?. Here we go. "To the most beautiful Deniz in the world, I love you." Let me have that. Later I'll.. Now let me make a wish. OK. Bravo! Bravo! - You won't be back late, will you?. - I will tonight, mum. - Shall I take those?. - Yes, sure. - See you. - Bye. ...in lstanbul. - In lstanbul?. - Yes. - So, what did you make of the play?. - I liked it. OK, I'm not that into theatre, but I think you were fantastic. Thanks. We're planning to do something. Want to join us?. - Sure. - I say let's get something to eat. Eat me, Zeynep. Eat me! - Shame on you! - We just stuffed ourselves with cake! - Fine, OK. - Is there nowhere to party in Ankara?. Sure there is. How about Manhattan, say?. I have take this call. I'll be right with you. - Hello?. - Darling?. Sorry I called late. I was waiting for the play to end. Happy birthday! Thank you. And thanks for the roses, Burak. - Did they arrive on time?. - Yes. The timing was perfect. My secret notebook Maybe I'll hide it in my heart As though opening up a hole Maybe the rivers inside me will reach the sea one day I'll wait for summer again Thanks, thanks. A short break, guys. We'll be back in five minutes. See you then. - I know the guy, you know?. - Seriously?. - From ages ago. - Who?. - Hey, how are you doing?. - Fantastic. You?. - Here you are, but why no warning?. - Yeah, well. It was kind of sudden. - Are you doing OK, you guys?. - Fine. Doing gigs and stuff. Sweetie, why are you being cool with me?. Is it still the row?. I'm not being cool. What gives you that idea?. - Well, what's up then?. - Look, it's my birthday today, Burak. Zeynep and that lot are waiting. That's why I'm in a rush. - OK, OK. - I'm hanging up. OK, bye. I have a friend here who I haven't seen for ages. He's the reason I got into music. As well as a great photographer, he's also a great musician. So let me ask him on stage. Ozgur. Tonight it's... ...the birthday of a very old and special friend. A very special friend I've known for 25 years. This is for her. Happy birthday, Deniz. Thanks. For no reason at all, or no reason we know of I guess we lost our rag and said some things When there were so many reasons and the time was just right We did nothing and said nothing We've told other people we love them at the same time We've leant our heads on other shoulders feeling a sense of total trust Could it not happen?. It could happen You, here for all these years Me, here for all these years Our paths have never crossed except on this September night - Zeynep. - Yes, honey?. - We're going to take a walk. - OK. - See you tomorrow. - OK. - Thanks for everything, Ozgur. - No problem. Congratulations. The play was wonderful. - Shall we sit down?. - Sure. The day I was born There was an accident. My dad took mum to hospital for routine check. They left, got in their car... ...and another car hit them from behind. Mum was rushed to the delivery room because her water broke. And they realized right then that I was tangled up in the cord. Imagine, if that car hadn't hit them, mum would never have known. She'd have gone home and I'd have died before I was born. I remember that story every birthday. I tell myself I might not have been here. That if I'm here, I'm meant to be here. I should be something, do something. - Ooph! I'm babbling, aren't l?. - No, no, no. When's your birthday?. - As the sun's up now, it was yesterday. - How do you mean?. The same day?. - I don't believe it! Really?. - Yes, really. - Happy birthday then! - Happy birthday to us both. Why didn't you say it?. I didn't want to steal the attention from you. Thanks. Ozgur, isn't this all too much of a coincidence?. - Could it not happen?. - It could happen. Where have you been all this time?. I have to give you something. What?. A surprise. Any clues?. We have to go somewhere you haven't been for 25 years. Time tumbles from my hands to the floor From there to the wooden balcony Clocks tick unsanctioned forever onwards to tomorrow Pictures are pale without sun, Feelings change Friends scatter to the winds, go their own separate ways And you and I, wilfully lost warriors up against the windmills We'll flow into the seas like rivers Perhaps this is best I vaguely remember, I think. I... ...was here. My grandfather was here. And you dropped the stuffed leaves right here. Close your eyes. Don't open them yet. Open. We live no longer than butterflies We're meant to love, let's start right now What else do we have to lose?. I kept it here in case you turned up one day. I have everything love needs Thank you. Before I can even breathe Before I can even breathe Before I can even breathe I love you Don't you... cry. You've wound yourself around my heart like ivy You've played with my blood, you've injected your poison You've spun your web in my mind like a spider The more I think of you, the more I want you Before I can even breathe Before I can even breathe Before I can even breathe Like alcohol running through my veins I'm more and more intoxicated by you It's like I've lost my soul And I live only for you Hello?. Sweetie, sorry to call so early. Burak, I'll call you in a bit, OK?. OK. Call when it's good for you. I have something to say. Something really important. Ozgur. There's something I have to finish. If you have to make a decision... ...I'll understand whatever you choose to do. - Are you OK?. - Yes, fine. - Are you sure?. - Positive. Go on. Go on, go. Can we go to Cankaya?. - Hello?. - Guess where I am, darling. - Where are you, Burak?. - In Ankara. You're in Ankara?. Ozgur?. What's up, son?. Mum, we got an offer to play in lstanbul. So?. We're leaving tonight. You mean for the New Year?. Is that it?. No, mum. A regular job actually. The money's really good. And I'll get a flat with the guys. Ozgur, I haven't got in your way before and I don't want to start now. Ozgur, look. But you aren't well, son. Huh?. - Mum, I'm fine. - Neriman, don't waste your breath! He's packed his bags, made his plans, his friends are waiting. - We don't have any say! - Just calm down. - Dad, look.. - Son, you're sick! Dad, I've spent enough time in hospitals. This life is mine. So is the risk. Now lay off me. Please just lay off. Ah, you have a life! Well, we don't, damn it! Just look at your mum. Is Ozgur OK?. Has he taken his pills?. Have they called from school?. Has he passed out somewhere?. - Yilmaz. - Hold on! You know what it's like... ...to think you might not come back every time you walk through that door?. - Call that "life"?.! - So is it my fault, dad?. - You think I wanted it like this?. - Son, your boundaries are clear! - And you can't step beyond them. - What are those boundaries, dad?. Huh?. Let's hear it! A life between hospital and the photograph studio?. I don't want. I don't want a life like that, dad! - What do you want then?. - Stop it! To die in some bar?. You want that?.! - For goodness sake! - Quiet, Neriman! I've wanted a safe life for him since he was a child! I've tried to get him a profession, some security! I wanted him to be able to stand on his own feet if we weren't around. Is that what you're rebelling against?. See it how you like. I'm going dad. I'm sorry, mum. Ozgur?. Are you... Walk through that door and you no longer exist for me! I didn't want to come over and disturb everyone first thing. - When shall we meet?. - I'll be ready in an hour. - Let's meet then at Cafemiz. OK?. - OK, honey. I'm serious, don't drink anything from an open bottle in bars and places. OK, Inci. Don't worry. Say you don't feel right there. Just come straight back. Mum, I'm not going for good, you know. You know of anyone from Ankara who's gone to lstanbul and come back?. - Inci. We're running late, sis. - C'mon, or I'll miss the train, mum. - It's no good like that. - It's fine. Perfect. OK then. Uncle. - Look after mum for me, OK?. - Don't you worry. C'mon! Don't be late! - Call as soon as you arrive. - OK. But don't wait. Go on, go. - Excuse me, is this seat free?. - Yes, sure. - Oh, sorry. - Excuse me. - Going to lstanbul?. - Yes. Istanbul. Darling?. Look what I found at the airport. You never told me about that. You look fabulous. Take a look. - We have to talk. - Sure we'll talk. In a while. - Burak, don't do this! - Shh! Deniz, will you marry me?. I can't. - What do you mean, you can't?. - I can't marry you. - Why not?. - Because... Deniz, what's up with you?. What's wrong?. Look, if it's the acting thing, I've thought about that, Deniz. Keep going. You're right about that. I'll be behind you all the way. Deniz, what's going on?. What's up with you, huh?. I'm not in love with you, Burak. Don't be ridiculous, Deniz! What's that supposed to mean?. I'm sorry. When did you decide that?. What happened while I was away?. Be straight with me, Deniz. What do you mean all of a sudden, "I'm not in love with you"?. - What's this about?. - Because... - Because...?. - I've fallen in love with someone else. Don't be ridiculous, Deniz. You're mad at me, that's all. What do you mean you fell in love with someone else?. What's happened the last three days?. Who is he?. What does he do?. It doesn't matter who he is. Burak, even if this hadn't happened... ...you know we've never been perfect. There's always been something missing. What, Deniz?. - Everything's been perfect. - Burak, don't do this. What have I done to you, Deniz?. What's missing?. Was I too all over you?. Or didn't I care enough?. I've always stood by you. Always... I stood by you through your worst times. When did you last tremble inside the moment you touched me, Burak?. Huh?. Has anywhere seemed beautiful to you just because I was there?. Or have you felt really happy only... ...and only because, I was with you?. Has a fleeting moment spent together ever meant everything to you?. What did you guys do, Deniz?. Did you sleep together?. What kind of question is that?. - Just asking. Did you sleep together?. - What does it matter?. - Deniz, did you sleep together?. - You want to know?. When?. While I was away?. Or when I was here?. Huh?. When was the last time?. When... Don't go. - No way is this real. - Wrong, it's real. - Look at what you're asking! - Give me one last chance, please! Believe me. I'm leaving to give us a chance. It may even be too late. One last chance. I would like to see Dr. Cem Yorgancioglu. I'm afraid the doctor is really booked for the next two weeks. I can't wait that long. Besides I'm an old patient of his. Could you tell him Ozgur Turgut is here?. If you'd like to wait, I'll try to reach him. OK, thanks. So do we get on the train or what?. I just called his home. He'd left five minutes before. What do we do?. - Should we get on or what?. - I say let's go. Let's get on. The valve repair will provide relief for a time. But it doesn't actually solve the problem, as you know. You mean I'll never fully recover?. The real problem is the weakening of the heart muscles. So it's rather up to you how much relief it will provide. You need to avoid things like partying, the stage, excessive stress. - I see. Thanks. - Hope you feel better soon. - Sorry about your ordeal. - Thank you. - Ozgur. For heaven's sake. - Mum, it's been four weeks. Considering I'm better now I can go. - Oh goodness! Where?. - To lstanbul. - But lstanbul. Ozgur, you... - Mum, don't worry. I'm going to do as dad wants and be a photographer. - But not with him. - Son, l... Dad, you said if I walked through that door, I no longer existed for you. You seem to have forgotten. But I remember. See you. Yes, Ozgur. Your results have come through. Seems you haven't taken much care of yourself since the operation. I've also checked your lstanbul file. Take a look if you like. No, you. Go on. Your condition's got much worse even in the space of a week. How bad is it exactly?. Ozgur, let me put it like this, knowing you have a thing about cars. When the fuel light starts flashing... ...you can drive another 30-40 km, right?. That's exactly where you are. We need to sort you out right away. There's no sense in waiting for your turn. You mean l... I should be hospitalized right now?. Can you give me a few hours?. To be honest, Ozgur, we need to hospitalize you at once. In fact, you may also need respiratory support for a while. But the decision is yours. Here's my card. Call if there's an emergency. And in the meantime be sure not to exert yourself. OK, thanks. The guy's an artist but his material sucks! Hey, come on, Deniz! Stop moping. Burak will soon be over it. You'll see. I thought at one point he'd never let go of my hand. You did the right thing. And that's that. Hello?. Ms. Usman?. Yes?. Deniz Usman, right?. Yes. Yes, that's me. You auditioned for our project, if you remember. Well, we'd like to work with you. Really?. Yes. That's why I'm calling. Oh my God! Thank you so much. Seeing those photos made us decide. So can we see you?. -OK, sure. I'll call you a bit later. - Thanks a lot. Speak to you later. OK, goodbye. They want me for that French film! The guy decided when he saw the photos. I don't believe it! I must tell Ozgur. I've no idea what to do. I want to tell her, but I can't even call. - You must. You have to. - So what do I say?. The whole thing's up in the air. I may not even come out alive. Don't talk crap! What do you mean?. Do you love the girl?. Of course I do. Yes! I'm crazy about her. OK, I'm hanging up. Call Deniz right now. And I'll see you there. I guess he's busy. What are you doing, son?. Didn't you promise not to run?. - Look, you'll get all sweaty. - Mum, please! I'm bored. Can't I go out?. Ozgur. Son, if you're listening... ...or if you listen one day... ...I have a few things to say to you. When a person sees the end of their life looming... ...well... ...they think differently. Forgive me, son. I know you feel bad too. The reason you haven't come to me... ...is because you're so like me. That's why I can't be angry with you. I can't be angry but... ...I miss you terribly, Ozgur. Remember what I said to you?. I said your boundaries were set, that you couldn't step beyond them. But I was missing the point, son.
