Ain't nobody worried about that girl, she the one that got all riled up today. I mean, she does feel some type of way about these attacks. I mean how do you feel about it? I don't know. I just... I feel like I need a big, strong, handsome… some... know you wasn't honest. ManI can say the same. It's all pieces to the puzzle. They're closing down my way. Hey now, we have to give it all up. Now I'm in the club Hennessey in my cup. One to the three now a brother messed up. And now a brother messed up. Know that my heart has changed. Know what you own cause you be playing games. The madness didn't stop. It just kept going. Didn't matter where you lived, didn't matter who you were. If the towel man wanted you, he was gonna get you. Nobody knows how he got inside of the house. Through the window, through a open door. He always found his way inside. They never heard him coming. Hello, officers, can I help you? Hey good afternoon, ladies. I'm looking for Ms. Maria Dunn. I'm Ms. Dunn. Yeah. What's going on? Girl, something happened last night and I was just scared to call the police. It's Ma'am, is there somewhere we can talk alone? I am new here and these are my friends. They're all I have. We talk in front of them. That's okay. - Here. - What? All right, I gotta go. Gotta go. All right. I'll holler at you when we get to work. Hey baby, uh, what's going on? Why the police here? Maria got attacked last night. Okay. Ma'am, could you please give us a description of your attacker? The first time he came in, I didn't see his face. He pulled the shower curtain on my head. Hold on, hold on, hold on. What do you mean the first time? After he was finished, I went to go look for my phone to call for help. He was there, standing in my bedroom. He broke my phone and told me if I called police, he'll come back and do it to me again. We're going to take you to the hospital for rape kit. Oh no, no, honey. I already showered and bathed. And after all of that violation, I went to sleep. I got up this morning. I bought me a new phone and I called y'all. Ma'am, ma'am, I hate to play devil's advocate here, but why'd you wait so long to call us? A devil's advocate? She don't need devil's advocate now, officer, she needs help try to catch the predator that done this. But nobody not talking truth. Everybody there say know people, one man where we covered in fear rape people. But none of them help the case. Believe me, if it takes my entire career, I am going to catch this guy. Hey man. I've been meaning to ask you to God damn Why you hot assed when you see 5-0 today? What you got warrants or something? - Mm? - Yeah. I ain't got no warrant. You know, don't mess with the police. Anyway, what was they here for? Man, they came to talk to Maria. They said she got raped last night. Maria? Yeah. - Fine ass, Maria? - Yeah Who'd do something like that. Now that girl ain't gon' be no good for a long time to come. What you mean? Like that's the type of shit that mess girls emotionally for life, leaving scars for life. I mean, but she do it to herself. always dressing like a litttle slut. All right, come on, man. I think it's more complex. You know how woman dresses. That one of God's most delicate creations, you know? Her smell, her look, her aura. No, I ain't never fucked a smell, a look and or a aura What the fuck you talking about? Whatever man. We gon' be here all night looking at this. I can't seem to see a pattern I don't know. Can you? No. The only thing all of our victims had in common was an unidentified male, 6 feet tall, 200 pounds with a towel on his face. Always wears condom and always wears gloves. That makes me think this has gotta be premeditated, not a spontaneous. I have to disagree. Perp may just be protecting himself from an STD instead of not trying to leave evidence. Either way, I'm calling quits for tonight. Ishmi, did Peter have a stroke? No Daddy, Pete has cultured himself. Nope. So, what's the deal here? practices. As the name suggests, social distancing means keeping your dist… island. device is the device for me. it is Williams died of smoke inhalation. In other news tonight, the serial rapist known as Towel Man has struck again. This time his victim was a 26-year-old student from Norfolk Dominion University, the world's first Ivy League HBCU. This is crazy. Police yet to find a motive or a suspect. I don't think it's just that. This is the 26th attack this year. When we come back, Jim will give you the weather. It suppose to be sunny this week. Stay tuned on WSKY News. Chris? Chris? Ah! Oh my Gosh. Don't scare me like that. You can pick an A and that ass so soft. We can 95 let me take a low dose.
