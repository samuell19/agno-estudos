OSS 117 takes a vacation -Mr Hubert! -My good old George! -How long's it been? -17 or 18 years. It's Mrs Baroness who's going to be pleased. You remember? We forget a suitcase? -I'll get it. -No, don't bother. I'll get it. Hubert? Hubert? Am I silly! Hello. Hubert! My darling! It is you. It is you alright. Here I am monopolizing you. Did you have a nice trip at least? Excellent. The weather was mild. The temperature favorable . A slight powerful wind. What a vocabulary! You speak like a weather man now? When you were small you taught me the slang of your high school. They taught me to keep silent. Yes I know, the secret, the language, the numbers... All this literature, I've read. I find it improbable. Sit down. Listen my little Hubert. Maybe they taught you to keep silent about yourself but as for me being silent. No! You are glad to find the shed, no? I am sure that you sometimes think of it when you hang around near Tangier, Tokyo, Constantinople or somewhere else. These nasty places where you work. The beautiful blonde in the beds of luxury hotels when you return at dawn. That must be very attractive. I am sure that all this is not worth one of our Nain Jaune parties till 10 in the evening. -Am I wrong? -Heu... -What "Heu"? Tell me that you don't regret our rural pleasures. I didn't say that. Our long evenings in the green lounge. With Bergson, Sartre, Kant, Freud. All muddied from having gone hunting with us all day long. Ah... I understand, you regret all this. -You were always a bandit. -My aunt! Oh yes! A real Bonisseur de la Bath...as me. Thank you. In the morning is it always some chocolate with pieces of bread and honey and blueberries on a big coat of butter? No. A light tea, a toast. The line...for the fight. And for the rest? No. The liver. The liver? We are also going to settle that. Louise's good soups, you remember? She is dead. But Socrate is always here, you know. He is going to be wild with joy, Socrates! Come on! La la la...Hop la! Come on! La la la...Hop la! But what's the matter with him? He adored you. George, fast, the cotton and the alcohol. Bastard of Socrates! My aunt. What's troubling you? At least it is not this nasty blow from a beak? -No, it is not that but... -Then what? I I won't have lunch with you. But what are you saying? He is unrefined! But you are crazy. He became crazy! They drove him crazy! I am very tired. My poor darling. Of course you are tired. You're dead... Dead from fatigue but all the same you will have a little soup with us just to please me. No, really, it's no use. Mom, do not insist any more. Hubert looks really wasted. A small tour in the park will do him a lot of good. You see them. They're Marx and Engels. No, let me do it. Be careful, your mother's looking at us. Look, that's Marcuse. He's beautiful, Marcuse. So my aunt, is it at noon that we stuff ourselves? I knew that it would do you some good to see our borders again. My big boy. Hello? Hello? Operator? Carefree call boss. Hello? Operator? Carefree call boss. OSS 117 calls Smith. -Allo? -Are you messing with me? During my holidays I almost was replaced by another agent. What does this mean? Calm down, Hubert. Calm down. You are on holidays. Take advantage of it. That's enough. I'm fed up. Hubert, come on. Take advantage of your holidays a few more days. Listen to me. Another joke of this kind and I quit. I can pass Bob de Moor (comic-books) now. Give instructions. Holidays are great, but after that? Still holidays, always holidays! I see you coming. Why not in Brazil? In Brazil? - -The sea, Sao Paulo, Guaruja... Rio? I adore. So much the better. You have a place retained on the Air-France 090 flight the day after tomorrow from Orly. And over there in Sao Paulo they're waiting for you. Take advantage of your family. The rest of your holidays will be more athletic. -It is for you. -Yes, I'm coming. It's that lady. Over there. And thank you very much. Ouh ouh! Hubert. Hubert Newman. Que belleta! How beautiful you are! You will never change. But how the devil do you manage to shoot a movie in Hollywood, one in Cinecitta and have fun in Brazil? We, the great actresses, can do miracles. -Hmm... -What hmm? Say, maybe it is paradise but it's the end of the world for Guaruja. Here we are. Hubert? Hubert? In principle it is only your double who has the fabulous honor to share my bungalow. -You will have to get used to it. -Right. It's no use to snooze everywhere. I'll try. -You will see. They will not even contact you. -You never know. No, I assure you. -Real holidays then? -Yes. Like in Tangier and Mamaya? And with you? -He must like me this good old Smith! -The proof is me being there. He knows well that us two... Come on, help me with this. Getting dressed for a bath? You know, here we only get dressed for the bath. Oh! Bastard! Arch, Gemini, take me with you! -But you're crazy! -Oh, shut up. Very discreet... -It's Swedish, it is... -You only think about that. You're such a bore. Oh yes! Oh my god! I apologize, it is my fault! I have to jump inside too. It's started, she makes her show. How? I almost drowned myself and you don't lift a finger. Feeling in a bad mood? You look like you really are bored to death. -Plus I wonder what I'm doing here. -Why? You want to leave? Sure! You should have said it earlier, my hero. You know very well that I am your slave. This evening was absolutely charming. Ah! I forgot to tell you that the Brazilian police are looking for you. I mean...not you, your double. As for you, dear Elsa, there isn't two like you. Fortunately. Excuse him. He is terrible. You are divine, my dear. ? ? ? ? ? -Senor Ernesto Gomez. -The pisolero? It is over there. The last house. Senor Ernesto Gomez, is he here? There on the motorcycle. -Him? What game is he playing? -How many kids do you have? -I don't know. Why? -He has 4 of. Then when In?s is back at it, he takes her on his motorcycle. Up yours. I have a contract for you. And you don't want to tell me who you are? Exactly. I see. In that case the price is double. Your price will be mine. The price is not the problem. The problem is the result. With Gomez there's never problems. Your man is already dead. This case is a little bit... special. The man in question, Senor Gomez has the guile of the fox, the distrust of the antelope and the courage of the jaguar. -Small game! -A fox who would shoot a bullseye, an antelope that would read Mao-Ts?-Toung and a jaguar that would be a world champion. No, believe me, Senor Gomez. It won't be a piece of cake. Come on! I know what I'm saying. And for more assurance I will give you two of my men. What? Three for a single customer? I'll be the laughing stock of the country! Certainly not. I believe that your reputation will only be increased. Ah? Yes. The man's never been vanquished, Senor Gomez. Never. It's $ 10.00. Plus traveling costs. Risk premium. The artillery of the guys is at your expense. Half now. -The rest later. -I offer you triple. I want everything to be perfect. -Prepared in great detail. -Oh Senor... Call me Gomez! (Inaudible) He gives himself the name of Hubert Newman. In reality he is the most formidable of the American special agents. Colonel Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath. OSS 117 in person! Elsa? Elsa? Has any one told you, you have a hideous appearance? Put this on. It will put your swimming coach's muscles to work. You and your art of messing up everyone in the world. That it's true. I love the world. And the world loves me. You will never guess what's in store for you tonight! One of the most private parties of the coast. The Comtesse de Mendez de Santa Rosa. Born Guevara. -What? -Yes, a distant cousin. (Brazilian meals, I suppose...) (Brazilian meals, I suppose...) (Brazilian meals, I suppose...) (Brazilian meals, I suppose...) Everything you don't like. -Your mail. -Thank you. This is for you. And that too. Thanks. "Discovery of a corpse in Allier. The body of a man about 30 was found in a ditch bordering the road from Sincoins to Nevers." Hubert? are you deaf? You could at least answer, right? Ah, the bastards! This article is a gift from the CIA. They will soon have me hunting. "Dear Hubert, I don't get it ... I read the article, but the body of the guys we shoot down is still in the well. Don't know who gave your photo. Ciao! Yann" Thank Smith will you. I think I'll have to go soon. The shooting of the passionate life of Charles de Faucon begins in a few days and I'm here pampering you. -It's Foucault, not Falcon. -Foucault, Falcon, you know ... Pasolini is going to be furious. I didn't try on any dress. Don't know what I have to do. I must think about my career. Most importantly, don't catch a cold. Why? It happens at the North Pole? This is just my luck. Oh shit! Hey! I will be more quiet with Pasolini than with you. -Well, ciao! -Ciao! Let me go! Let me go! Flavio! Flavio! Oh my god! Finally! A small concussion. No more. Nothing serious. -Lucky you. -Hopefully. -How much for this plate? -Please! Flavio! Flavio! You see. Flavio, you gave me such a fright. How could I apologize, Mister... Hubert. I am in a hurry. You'll come with me? You can't pay attention, can you? -The poor dear, where is the little darling? -A silly joke, it's nothing. -He was faking. -Comedy? At his age? This one will surely make a lot of women suffer. No. Unfortunately. -There's another way out, I hope? -Of course. Where do you think you are? Come. Follow me. We let you Gilberto. Mom will be very happy to know you're in good health. I'll pass tomorrow. You told me that 15 days ago! Obviously you're very busy. -Shut up fool! -Well. If you allow ... Oh no, stay! Oh yes, stay Mister. Stay dear Anna. We could dine together. What do you say my little darling? -Not tonight. -Come, do not look at me like that? -I still said something stupid? -You do not stop. I try to fix things and you see the result. I adore you ... especially when you're mad. And you, this dish is not for sale! Get out! Sit. Go away. -Missed. -You see. -He is in the shop. -At Olga? El Rojo? I really want to go see the face of the phoenix! -Take care all the same. -Wait for me in the car. Raoul. Is it a yes? Yes. After we've returned Flavio home naturally. Ok, brat? Good evening Mrs Olga. You received my table? The one with blue butterflies? It arrived this morning. A marvel. Well. We're gone. Hey! Mr Santovski? What shall I do with those butterflies? -Ciao! -Ciao! -Ciao! It might be better to take the two cars. -Arturo can drive yours. -Okay. -Let's try to not have him alive. -Do not worry. We'll stick to him. -Be careful, here they come. -Do not worry, Mom. I'll be right back. It's time to see Gilberto. Go ahead. Where do you work? Not in Santos. In an art gallery. It does not pay much but at least I have my mornings and my evenings. If I understand correctly, I have no time to lose. Where are we going? Decide. Why not a quiet place? What would you say of Tucurucutuba? -This is a wonderful spot, you know. -Yes, but it is a backwater. Why not? "The silvery moon, the midnight bath, the heat ... The grace of the beautiful Brazilian made him forget the danger threatening them, on this enchanting beach of Tucurucutuba. OSS 117 cherfully losts his head in the arms of the young girl, while hiding in the shadows of the tropical vegetation, ruthless killers observe them... They're out of our sight. I see them. They're returning to the beach. What are they fucking doing? Love, my pal. Love. Let's get closer. And then Raaa! Give me my robe. I want to get dressed. If someone found us here. Night dresses. Very poetic, but a little cold. Come. There's even a cabin there. Hubert. Yes. Nothing. What is it? Shut up. Come here. Gently. -Do not be afraid. -I am not afraid. It's the shame. I'm engaged for the last 2 months. An American too. He's coming in two days. I no longer love him, Hubert. Now I must drop off the Jeep. I have to rent another car. But what do they really want with you? It must be a mistake. They probably take me for another man. We'll have to separate for a few days. Few days, that's vague. I'll try to be as fast as possible. Do not try to reach me by phone. I'll call you tomorrow. Be careful. Hubert. I'm waiting. I told you so, Gomez. This case is not a piece of cake. Oh No. It is surely not. And my men? How did they behave? Very well. They are dead. And him? He is still alive. -Congratulations. -His days are numbered. But this time ... I will act alone. Come on! And how? Well ... this Anna. I know where she lives. "Mr. Newman. Reach me urgently. Business for you. Room 21. John Larue." Mr. Larue, please. Yes. No. It's you Larue? Your name is Terroir usually. It's the boss who sent you? Obviously. Excuse me. But I'm really fed up. It fell on you. I saw. You do not know what it's like to play goat when you do not know who is the wolf. While then, I am pretty sure, they have everything on me from the size of my neck to the color of my underwear. So, you can imagine ... as soon as I put the nose out... Especially since, if I count well, I already snuffed... 6 of them. Yes, I know, it's terrible. But it was the only way to make the mission successful. The only thing the service is certain of ... is that several facsists groups from right-wing Latin American backgrounds have decided to attack Cuba. And then? Well, the boss thought he could grant you the leave ... you asked for. -What is the relationship? We just had to make them believe that immediately after ... you intended to go to Sao Paulo to learn about their activities. So you gave them my address in France? - Of course. That's why they tried to give family holidays to your double. Well, this is perfect, absolutely perfect! Listen! Stop that! Their purpose is to make the U.S.A responsibile for the attack they had to get the best agent of the CIA when starting their operations. The best agent or his double. It was less dangerous and it saved appearances. We're trying to put up a counter-attack with the Brazilian police but you know... with the little we know. Then it was clear that you and you alone could effectively worm your way into their plot. Okay, enough ointment. You really do not know anything else? No. Only that they try to engage a lot of pilots and seamen too. At the beginning we thought that they planned an air attack but now ... You're good in the service... So we prepared a passport in the name of Abraham Hawkins for you. A glorious pilot. Korea and Vietnam, the best. Oh, I almost forgot about the boss. Give him my best. Hello? Who do you want? Anna? Yes. But who are you? Pantero. It's you. -It's you... -I'm calling from a garage ... A stupid failure. -Anna? -Yes. I have to leave the car here. I'm going to (inaudible) and rent a car at the concierge. -Yes. -And then I'm coming. Yes, okay. Anna, listen! -Yes. -See you soon, my angel. See you soon. -A call for Mr Hubert Newman. -Hello? It's from abroad? Do not quit. No, it's a local call. You're on line senorita. -It's me, Anna. -I asked you not to call me. I'm home. You must come right away. You're in trouble? Yes. I can tell you nothing on the the telephone. Come at once. Ok, I'm coming. But still, you can not explain in 2 words what happened? Anna? Anna? Anna? Anna? God damn it! Do not watch. I know. It's William. He died in my place. You know, Anna, Hubert Newman... is not your real name? No. You... You're going to tell me that you're the CIA. Exactly. Colonel Hubert Bonnisseur de la Batte. Colonel? You? Colonel in peril. We must hide now. I'm sure Gilberto will have an idea. He will hold his tongue? - Gilberto? He would give his life for adventure. Gilberto! Gilberto! Up! Up! Gilberto! What is it? You know I asked you never to come here. Listen, Gilberto. Everyone's life is at stake. -It's why ... -What're you talking about? Mom, Flavio, me ... You must listen Mr Hubert. You have to do everything he tells you. Fine. If you have to talk. That's it. Leave us alone. I always have to go when it gets interesting. -They want your skin? -Yes, they want it. -I am the CIA. -Really? Listen, there's something a lot more important than me in this case. Something more important than your family as well. -Or Anna. -It's enough for me if my family is in danger. And peace? -Peace? -I know. It looks huge. I am the target of a certain Ernesto Gomez. A gunslinger, right? -And what about Santovski? -Santovski? I know him. Everybody knows him around here. He has his hands in everything. All the shady businesses. And he knows me? But how? He entered the shop by chance and he left when you left with Anna. Exciting! Come on, go away. Pretend I'm not here. After all, it should not be difficult to find him, you know. Where? A bar. One of those belonging to Balestri. -Balestri? -Yes, Balestri. What? You do not know him? He's one of the richest in Brazil. He owns a dozen night-clubs in the Major Certorio street in Sao Paulo, 2 in Thesopolis, 1 restaurant in Recife, 1 hotel in Bel Horizonte and other properties in Argentina, Peru, Venezuela...everywhere in fact. When Balestri lifts his little finger everyone obeys. In Rio's banks as in Bahia's dens and Santos whorehouses. It was good old times... but I do not regret it. In the end, I always liked a small home than a large one in other people's place. At that time, I barely had time to turn back before a diamond necklace flowed around my neck. Diamonds and shit. That's Balestri. I do not know what you're tampering with both of you, but I warn you sir I know them dear and I realize my mistake. So leave my kitchen in peace. Some toys you don't put into the hands of Balestri. He's french. Is that so! It's Fred who told me everything. Fred? He is the bartender at Siros. -You can count on him, at least? -Fred? I can ask him everything. Wait. First let's fix the liabilities. -They need to find my body. -What? -I mean William's body. -The poor guy. Since they think he's me, lets continue. -He's disfigured, they won't suspect. -I do not understand. His car is near the house. His body a little further. I put the body at the wheel. And you slide this identity paper in his pocket and my signet ring on his finger. You're a new man, just like in the books. Gosh! Yes. The service has no imagination! -You're back? -No. You've never been so well-shaped and beautiful. Not for me, Fred. Give me a martini instead. Fred? Yes. I've never asked anything of you. No, unfortunately. You must do me a favor. You look unhappy, Gilberto. I would do anything for you, to make you happy. At least let me tell you what it is. But Gilberto, you get me all warmed-up! Is it so important? -Very. -Secret? -Absolutely. -Personal? -If you want. -Say it. -Balestri. -Ah! -Is he married? -Yes, Paulette. God knows where he found that girl. -I have to reach her. -What? Paulette Ballestrie? -You had her... -Almost. What? You have Balestri cuckolded? It's hardly believable. Why? -Paulette is cloistered at double-turn. -There? Where? But she did not tell you? It is completely unreachable, buddy. -Explain. -Hiporanga. Their island. -Hiporanga? -It is where Balestri lives. I wonder how she could escape even for a few hours. Especially since, over there Balestri fears nothing. It'a fantastic house. A kingdom. He has his own airport. He has it kept like a military. And you want to go there? My God. I wonder. He never has guests? Especially not Paulette's lovers! -You should... -I should do what? You should pretend you're a pilot. Because pilots... he only sees them over there. Usually it is Santos seeing them here at first. I wonder what they do with all these pilots. Very beautiful boys in general. It would be a pity if they get in trouble. Gilberto, please, be careful if you go there. He's terrible, you know. And her...She's so... -So what? -She's Messaline! I can understand how she has faced danger to see you. -Please, be careful. -I promise. Well, I'm going home now. All alone. I will pray for you. I know nothing. I didn't see you. I told you nothing. Thank you Fred. -Ciao. -Ciao. Do not act rashly. You are wonderful. Being reckless is exactly my job. Anna? Do not tell her anything. Tell her that Brazil will perhaps have me banned for some time. That she was a beautiful perennial flower on my way. Something a little poetic. It seems to me that I was a little rough with her. You know, I did not have time to say pretty things. Tell her that I thought about them. In any case this is the village. The fishermen village of Pereque. Look. Maybe it's there. We'll ask that guy. Where is Balestri's Island? Uh? Where is it? Will you tell me? Paulette? Paulette? My kitty? No? I beg you, my angel. Don't have any. You know very well that it is full of things that hurt you. Sugar, cream, butter. It's bad for your diet, you know it. Here, stuff yourself! You, all of you, get the hell out of here! My kitty. Come on. Come on. Eat, my kitty -Taste it, my dove. -No. It won't hurt you. To please his beloved Ren?. Don't you want some? Bitch. -What's the matter, Marcello? -I'm sorry, boss. -It's Senor Santovski. -What about him? He's worried. The guy that he'd instructed to kill the American agent has disappeared. -He has not claimed the money. -So what? Senor Santovski says it's not normal. He's becoming a pain in the ass, this guy! Does he think I'm interested in playing boyscout with his friends? Marcello, do you think they got a good look at me? You see me freeing Havana? Really, Marcello? You see me barging in Pig's bay? Complete nonsense. Paulette, my kitty. Me, Marcello, it's money I'm after. Just that. Only dough. I'm doing this only for Paulette. She could not love a man who steps back from danger. What she loves in me, you see, it's the sense of adventure. So the others should stop breaking my balls with their politics. That's all he said Santovski? -The operation is for the day after tomorrow. -We'll see. Be careful, we could be seen. Go away. -I already told you to leave me alone? -How beautiful you are! You're as beautiful as the moon on Bahia. You're pissing me off! Leave me alone. -Why not me? -Not your business. I do what I like. I understand. You want Marcello. He will come and you are going to make love. This is unheard of! And even if it was true? -Come on, look at you. -What? I'm not as beautiful as Marcelo? I'm not as strong as him? You're making me mad! Leave me alone monkey! Too bad for you. I'll tell the boss that his wife sleeps with Marcello. That's it. He will have you beat for your insolence. I am his woman afterall. I hope, madam, that brute did not hurt you. -Who are you, sir? -My name is Abraham Hawkins. American citizen. I have to meet a certain Marcello who works for Mr Balestri. But how did you get here? You know, I was afraid of being turned down. I crossed the bay. The bay? But that's at least 400 meters. At least. I had to see this Mr Balestri without intermediaries. And you heard what this thug who tried to rape me said? Absolutely everything, Mrs. But you can count on my discretion. You walked in the park dreaming. And you surprised me. And you really think I'll introduce you to my husband? Well... Well for a Yank you're awfully complicated. Okay. Suppose I take you to Mr Ballestrie. I warn you. He is not the easiest guy in the world. And so suspicious. -But I have nothing to hide. -It would be better for you. It's a pity that a beautiful small face like yours ... But let's get back. The old man will see you immediately. -Please follow me. -At you command, ma'am. -So you went to the Siros? -Yes. -And there they gave you my address. -Exactly. Yeah. It's believable. And after? Hitch-hiking. When I saw the Hiporanga sign... You've been left there and you did not even try to go through the port. Well... Ren?, you already looked at Costa's mug behind the grid on the port? Not really the engaging kind... So Mr Hawkins said... I said... He said ... "for an athlete like me 400 meters is a piece of cake and this way I can contact Mr Balestri personally. " Face to face. With confidence, man to man, you know. Well, Ok. It's alright. I forgot, Mr Hawkins, pending the verification of your statements ... Please do not leave the orange room. You'll see. It is very pleasant. Please. Let me in. Come on, open the door. -No lights. If we're seen together... -It'd be awful. -Especially for me. -Your life is in danger. Of course. Explain. Don't patronize. I know what I'm saying. We must go at once. Relax. Sit down and let's have a quiet talk. Are you crazy? A "quiet talk"? We're walking on charcoals. Come on. Come here. By my side. My God. You're not thinking about it. What if someone sees us? They won't come looking for you in the room of a mercenary. Let's talk seriously. Why's my life in danger? My husband just sent one of his men out tonight to to see if waht you said is true. Marcello went to the Siros. -And then? -He called back. -Nobody has seen you there. -Obviously it's worrying. Very. And what do you think is going to happen? You know whatt as well as me. I assure you, Madam... Well, as you are a man, a true man... I beg you, take me away from here... Far from Marcelo, far from the sun. I know everything about you. Only you can save me. And maybe I can save you in return. Fifty-fifty, you know... It's a deal. But tell me everything. Everything. I was there when he called back. So you're the CIA? how can I leave? Take this key. The small door on the north side of the house. Tomorrow Marcello will lead me to Sao Paulo. You will be downstairs at 2 pm. You will be hidden in the dock or under the stairs. Do not worry. I know you can leave this room without attracting attention. When you know how to cross the bay and come to the island. Upon leaving I will tell Marcello I forgot my purse. Oh shit, I forgot my purse. Please Marcello go get it for me. He'll get it... and me... very well. But, if someone sees me? I'm not invisible. They may be very well armed, but in the brain department any CIA agent exceeds them. Don't worry. Ten years! I've waited ten years for such an opportunity! Ten years! For ten years I've been his poodle, his prisoner. -And you let him have his way. Bah... -I owed him everything. -Everything? If you think it's funny to hang in la Villette all day long. He made me his woman. In five seconds I walked from Pigalle St to United States St. I do not know if you realize the transhumance. And then he fell into troubles. Well, I think so. One morning, while shaving, he said : "How would you like the suburbs of Rio?" -You could not refuse. -Of course I couldn't. And then when I saw for the first time ... It was after that I realized that it could also be a prison. My name is Paulette. Yours is Hawkins, right? No, it's Abraham, Mrs Balestri. I told you, it's Paulette. Between accomplices I suppose it's tolerated. -And Marcello? -Marcello? He said he would take me in his arms on a moonless night. And presto! Beyond the sea. But in the end he is not gifted for even crawling. However... He went on to boast that he slept with the boss's wife. Did you see the type of competition that seized all Balestri's people. -I saw. Me dreaming of a young and handsome guy. A Prince Charming. After all these years I stayed very simple. And you? You see you're a little bit Prince Charming? Prince Charming is a bit too flattering. Neither Prince nor Charming. Not Charming? You? No woman could resist you from la Villette to Matto Grosso. And you haven't said where we were going. Drive straight ahead. For at least ten kilometers. Then you will turn left at the crossroads until Bertioga. And then it's Cabanas. Balestri bought a house by the sea there. As he doesn't go there anymore. Been since 6 or 7 years and we never returned. Well, this is perfect. Since you seem certain that your man will not look for us here. -I hope there's a telephone in our little nest. -Of course. Why? I don't know. I think we're going to need it. Mrs Balestri... -Abraham... -Mrs Balestri.. Stop calling me "Mrs. Balestri" so boisterously. Come near me. Come on. Take me in your arms. Undress me... With pleasure, Mrs Balestri. With pleasure. But before that I would like you to tell me 2 or 3 important things. There's nothing more important than making love. Certainly. But I would still like some clarification. No! Paulette... Well... What is it? Tonio Santovski and your husband hire pilots. This can't wait a little longer? Absolutely not. I hate making love while thinking about something else. Don't you? I've been doing it this way for ten years. It's so depressing. Since your husband does not belong to their party why does he give them support? Come. Come and I will tell all you want. No. Speak now. I've never met a guy so cruel. Handsome and cruel. The two fit together, don't they? Get back to Balestri, if you please. If you want to know the truth, Balestri only does it for me. Balestri don't give a shit about anything except me. This thing, this conspiracy if you prefer. For him it's a little more gold, diamonds and bonds to throw at my feet. That's all. I'm wealthy, Abraham. Full to bursting. And you leave me here all alone. And Santovski, tell me, is he the one scheming all this? -The invasion, the attack ... -I do not know. I find the guy disgusting. All I know is that he is an engineer graduated from Stanford. And he always had contacts with fascist groups. In Europe and America also. He did so well the Yankees kicked him out. That's why he has this grudge against the USA. You should have heard him do his press readings for when the attack is underway. Oh yeah? What did he say? "It is with the help of the USA that a coalition of extreme-right nationalist parties has launched against Cuba an attack without precedent. Taking advantage of the cover of an air-sea Brazil-Cuba-California rally, organized for the first time, the american emigrant Antonio Santovski launched a high-scale bacteriological warfare against the island. The attack's purpose was to destroy all life, any agricultural crop or fish, and exterminate the entire population of the Socialist Republic of Cuba. -I will end up being late for the appointment. -And if he does not come Gilberto? He will come. At worst, if he does not, you will answer the telephone yourself. What'll I say? With your imagination you could convince anyone if you really wanted. I'm going to go for it. Yes, I will convince him. An actress like me. And after that, tell me? After that, you will make me happy, eh? -Hello. -Hello. You got the gun? You're going back there? You're crazy? You, as agreed, you'll go to Cabanas. But beware of her and her reactions. She is not stupid. And as good looking as you are and hungry as she is... I think you will get along very well. Myself I know how to play with Balestri. Ciao. Don't be afraid. I don't want to hurt you. Where is Balestri? In the office. Be quiet, Balestri. She'll be back. She still acted on a whim. She never did such a thing. Come on, she is still a child. You know it. -That's it. You saying she wants me to die. -Come on! She adores you. I assure you. You should not be so nervous. And Hawkins? What make you think they left together? Three times nothing. Except that at that moment she escapes that damn Marcello's company that damn pilot disappears from the orange room. -Exactly. It's too obvious. -But, Santovski, I do not have your subtlety. I have not read your books. I only have my nose here! -She did not even know him. -Yes, but she has always been friendly. But still ... She thought he was a small time mercenary. A CIA guy, a spy! Maybe he even forced her! Come on! A kidnapping in Hipporanga? It is you, Ren?, who have read too many books. -The books tell the truth sometimes. I have kidnapped Ms. Balestri. -You? -Me alone. -Like a big boy. -Marcello! Without putting pressure on you I suggest you to stay calm. Calm! -Hawkins, I demand... -Dear Mr Balestri, requirement is now on my side. Hawkins, what you do not know... is that we now know who you really are. -Since you know everything Mr Balestri... -So stop calling me Hawkins. -Yes, Boss. This is nothing Marcello. A misunderstanding. Disappear. As for you Hawkins... I'm fed up. Just ask Santovski who I really am. Talk Santowski, come on. OSS 117 himself. I order you Balestri to take this phone and dial 54-11-54. What? What's this number? You may not have a good memory. This is the number of your follies. This small house in Cabanas. Hello? Hello? I'm listening? -Hello? -Hello? Mr Balestri? Yes. Speak up, please. I guess that's news from Mrs. Balestri you want to know. -Yes, I'm listening. -She's here. Between our hands. Still alive. Stop this, hoodlum! Of course if you resist the wishes of Colonel de la Bath she may suffer. -No, not this! -And she may come back in your hands ... slightly changed. -Monster, bastard! -Please Mr de la Bath. -Stay tuned. She wants to talk to you. If she is still able to do it. Paulette! Oh, Ren?... My Paulette, what have they done to you? Where are you? Oh Ren?, I beg you, do all they say. Otherwise they will kill me. Ah, no, no, have mercy! It's over, Ballestrie. Nothing more to add. If I'm not at the meeting... you shoot her. -Understood? -Understood. You've got the advantage. Talk and I will obey. You will understand immediately. She has spoken. Ah! I told you! And what did she tell? I know that taking advantage of the air-sea Brazil-Cuba-California rally aircraft and tourist boats will try to destroy any civilization and all life in the Castro's Socialist Republic. The bitch! Shut up Santovski, it is me talking! Comments will come after if we have time I was saying. Your wife talked and she revealed the whole plan of action. And the details, these details who payed the price of this exceptional adventure. Ah, women! The providence of special agents. -She spoke about the containers? -Containers! Perfectly! -Containers filled with ... -Balestri! This woman, I would like to ... She surely has sufferred a lot ... Filled with...? Come on! Insect eggs! Yes. Enough to devastate the island for months. -And yet? -Millions! Billions of insect eggs! Grasshoppers! And for livestock billions of cattle flies. And the people? Did you think about them? They will be particularly well treated. Millions of tsetse flies. Not one Cuban alive. -All dead! -All this is very nice but one detail is missing. Where are the clandestine laboratories? The culture broth simmering all this crap? Santovski? -Balestri? -Balestri, better shut your mouth. Near Porto Alegre. And airplanes? And boats? The same place. You know, I'd better take a weapon. They won't hesitate to kill me now. Take what you want. He wanted to kill you. -It's nothing. It was an accident. -Let's go now. But it is not here. With your plane we'll be there in a few hours. Marcello, dump the body and get me the aircraft out of the hangar. I followed your instructions Senor. All is in order. -But what's going on? Just a second, Fernando. Come with me. Have you been monitoring the pilots barracks? Yes, Senor. Our men are placed all around. They are armed to the teeth and will stop pilots from approaching if found. For now everything is calm. -Perfect. And gasoline? -200 drums have been spilled. Laboratory and stocks are virtually flooded. -And did you have the explosives placed? -All is in order, Senor. -We can light the fire anytime! -But, boss, why would you want to destroy everything? -Why destroy all the witnesses? -Do not worry about it. We have been betrayed. All the evidence must disappear. Stop asking question and join your men. Light the matches now. In a few minutes everything will be destroyed. -The laboratory, the port ... -Belastri, you're crazy! -The aircrafts ... -You can not sacrifice these men! -The barracks... -This is atrocious they will burn! You're crazy! -Get off me! -You are sick, I have to warn them immediately! -No, Mr de la Bath! Stop him! Stop him! Fernando, stop him! Men are living proof. They shall not survive. You see he's crazy! We must stop this! Beware! Everything will explode! Beware! Get out! Get out! Beware! Clear out! Everything will explode! Beware! It's gonna explode! Go! Let me go! Mr de la Bath! Everything will explode, I want to live! Don't leave me here Mr de la Bath! Mr de la Bath! Mr de la Bath! Bastard! Mr de la Bath! Paulette! Paulette! Hello? Hello? Hello?... This damn telephone in France! Hello? If they don't answer me I'm going crazy! Hello? Hello? George? Yes, Madame. Try to do something with these wires. Do something, fast. Hello? You are my Hubert? Here, catch Hello? My darling, good god, I hear you so bad! Hello? Of course I understand everything. But still ... Hubert To leave me here and fly away like that! There are limits Hubert, there are limits! Oh, you listen! But it's my scarf! Listen Hubert, we prepared fantastic meals for you. A dish with black beans, red beans, oranges ... It will remind you of your holiday in Brazil. -It's fejuade. -Wait, someone's talking to me. -It's fejuade. -Oh yes, it's called fejuade! A good old fejuade made in France! Hello? You know that we're waiting for you with a great impatience. You will tell us everything? All the same, some little details... Unimportant details. I promise that I will not ask any questions involving the military secrets of an allied power. Reassured now? Secret agents are the last romantics. Do not be late, I destest it. At twelve sharp. Listen my boy. Be very careful when crossing the great gallery. Don't catch a cold. Your poor dad always put a sweater on to come to diner... My aunt, I adore you! George, anyway, have that telephone repaired. I must say that I have a surprise for you. I hired a maid, she's not bad. She showed herself to the house. She is Brazilian ... I thought it would make you happy. Her name is ... Dolores?... Conchita?... Anna, her name is Anna! timings : meatisgood translation : aloysius70
