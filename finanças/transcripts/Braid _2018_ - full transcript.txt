Uh-uh. 500 in Brooklyn, 750 in the city. That's what Coco said. 22 plus 44 plus 20 equals... Is... 83. Okay, we got 83k right here. My dad's definitely gonna wonder how I paid off my student loans. $83,000. Maybe I'll just do it slowly, like once a week. Is it bad that I don't feel bad about this, like, at all? I felt way worse when I was waiting tables. Remember this moment. Everything's about to change. Open up! Police! You've got two seconds to open this door! - Just leave it. - Go, go, go. Open up! Do you wanna get caught, is that what you want? What the fuck is wrong with you? Coco's gonna slit our fucking throats! - Trying to bounce, bitch? - Whoa, put that thing down. You scared the shit out of me! Excuse me, ma'am, my friend is sitting here. - Oh, of course, I'm sorry. - Sorry. Here, I'll help you up. Sorry. Oh! It's okay. I'm sorry. Thank you very much. I'm so sorry. Do you have everything? I think so. - Okay. - Thanks. Shit. They took the stuff, all of it. It's a fucking miracle we got away. Last night? About 80 worth. No, no, no, nobody saw us. No, we were just unpacking and weighing it. I swear, we had no time to sell any of it. Somebody's in here! What? Good morning. Tickets, please. Uh... You look very familiar. I'm a model and an actress, so you've probably seen my face... No, I, uh... I don't watch TV. My bad. May I have your ticket, please? Okay, you can stop pretending like you don't know me now. Goddess Vesper. Listen, my friend and I don't have tickets. - Your friend? - She's sitting at the back. - What's your destination? - Montpellier. Uh, that's about $80 times two. - 10 minutes. - 30. - 15. - 20. And I'll pretend you're not high. All right, let's do this. What the fuck you looking at? Lick it. Thank you, Goddess. Thank you. Watch where you're going. You watch where I'm going, asshole. Hey, are you sure she's gonna be there long? - Possibly. - What if she got a caretaker? You always come back, you old witch. - Coco called. - Shit. What did he say? We have to be back here in two days, noon or sooner. We've got 48 hours, starting now. So how do you wanna do this? Well, you know Daphne. She's not just gonna let us in like that. We'll need to search the whole house to find the safe. To do so, we're gonna have to play the game. We're doing the game we do every day. "Hospital." - We have to play. - That's boring. We have to play. That's annoying. I hate it. I'm Dr. Petula. Welcome to my doll's hospital. Well, Doctor, this is my daughter Tilda, and she isn't feeling well. No wonder. We're playing your stupid game. Lay down, daughter. I'm not gonna let you two tell me what to do because you're not my mom! - Yes, I am your mom. - You're not! - Yes, I am! - Stop it! Once we get into the house, whatever she asks you to do, you're gonna have to do it. No excuses. She says, we obey. Is that clear? Tilda, is that clear? Hey, Mom. You okay, Mom? Hey, darling. How was school? It was good. They let us out early. I'm hungry. Of course. Of course you are! I was just about to start cooking. Remember the rules. Rule number one: Everyone must play. Rule number two: No outsiders allowed. Rule number three: Nobody leaves. Come here! Your nails! They're too long and dirty! I wasn't done. Go wash them. Immediately. And brush your teeth too! He'll be here any minute. What are you still doing here? Because my nails aren't dirty. I'll do it myself. Come here! Mom? Mom! Help me. Get in. Come on. Mom, the doctor's here! How are you doing, ma'am? Welcome back, Doctor. Inhale for me. Exhale. Everything looks fine here. How strange. She's been coughing all week. I'll prescribe something for that. And her posture is terrible too. Her balance is very bad as well. All right, let's see what's going on here. Don't be scared. Rule number one. Everyone must play. Mm. Sorry. - Perfectly healthy. - Oh! Thank goodness! Oh, darling, what do we say to the doctor, hmm? "Thank you, Doctor." All done. She's shy. Doctor, can I get you something to drink or a snack perhaps? I made some ice-cold lemonade... You forgot to measure me. I was just about to measure you. Where are you, tape? Tape. Did you forget it, Doctor? No, I'm positive I put it in here. Rule number three: Nobody leaves. Shh. Doctor, is everything okay? Yes, ma'am, all's good. Doctor? Could you please pass the salt? We have 41 hours left. There's not much time. Doctor... you must be exhausted. Why don't I show you to your room? Well, sleep well, Doctor. Thank you, ma'am. It's good to have you back. Tilda? Hello, Doctor. I just came down to get a glass to water. But of course. I can't sleep. - I better get back to bed. - Please stay. I feel safe around you. Are you trying to bounce, bitch? What the fuck is wrong with you? You scared me! Holy shit. Put that thing down. And don't fuck with the mailbox until we're done, okay? Okay, I was just checking my phone. Geez, are you fucking serious? You wanna get caught? Is that what you want? No, Petula. I don't wanna get caught. I just wanna get this over with fucking ASAP, okay? What if she put everything in a bank account? What if she didn't? Well, how much did she give you for the physical? I don't know. I didn't look yet. Shit. Are you fucking kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me? Is she fucking... - What is wrong with her? - It's all right. Just relax. Coco's gonna slit our fucking throats! We have 28 hours left. Plenty of time to find the safe. Then let's get cracking, and let's do it now, okay? God, you have no idea what fucking crazy cuckoo Daphne made me do last night. What? She made me, like... fuck her. - What? - God. Really don't make me say it again. I fucking heard you. I fucking heard you! - Shh! - Oh, my God. Did she make you come? Did she pay you? Oh, my God. Poor Daphne. She's fucking obsessed, man. Aw, are you okay, girl? Yeah. Yeah, I'm perfect. Can I have some yum yum, please? Uh, I think you've had enough. I thought we were splitting it 50/50? Yeah, we are, but I'm not gonna share my half with you, if you're gonna binge on it now, Snow White. Just give it to me. Okay. - Geez, have it. - Thank you. The fucking big deal is. Just some Vicodin. Tilda, this is not Vicodin. What? How much have you been taking? What did you give me? Tilda, Tilda. Tilda. Tilda! Let's go to the tree house. Tilda, Tilda. Hey, look at me. You're really high right now. You've taken a lot of PCP, like a lot. You have no fucking idea. Okay, make room, Tills, I'm coming in. I'm just gonna be right back, okay, Tilda? Just stay right there. We're doing the game we do every day. - We have to play. - That's boring. We have to play. I don't care. I'm Dr. Petula. Welcome to my doll's hospital. Well, this is my daughter Tilda. She isn't feeling well. No wonder. You're playing this stupid game. I'm not gonna let you two boss me around to play this stupid game because you're not my mom! - Yes, I am! - You're not! - Yes, I am! - Stop it, stop it! It's not our fault. Remember that. I know. But if we do get caught lying, we'll never get to see Daphne again. I know, I know. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Detective Siegel. I came to find out what happened. We were playing in the tree house, and Daphne just fell out. How exactly did she just fall out? Um... - Mrs. Peters? - Yes. Your granddaughter's doing fine. - She just woke up. - Ohh! But her lower abdomen has been critically damaged. Unfortunately, I doubt she'll ever be able to conceive. Oh, my God. No! Tilda! Tilda! We gotta go! We gotta go now! Come on, we gotta go now! Shit. Can we just get our phones, please? Siegel, where the hell are you? Montpellier Police Station, Detective Siegel. Yes, ma'am. I'll take care of her personally. My dolls. Shh, my darlings. It's okay. Mother is here. Mother has always been here, but now you're back where you belong. Oh, shh, shh, shh. All is well, my darlings. My dolls... Hey, stop it! My silly girls. You were never fit for the outside world. In this house, nothing has changed. Shh. I've never changed. Here, everything is possible! You know, a mother must always forgive her children. We are a family. Shh! Quiet now, quiet. Reality will never keep up with our dreams. Girls? You stay put now. Mother will be right back. Detective. - Can I help you? - Good evening, Miss Peters. It appears your neighbors have been hearing unusual noises coming from your home. - Unusual noises? - Screaming. Young women screaming at night. Oh, God. Oh, God, this is embarrassing. I, um... I've recently changed my medications, and you see, I've, um... I'm still getting adjusted. - I apologize for that. - No, no, it's okay. No need to apologize. Loneliness can make us do strange things. Well, I can guarantee I will do my best to make sure these... unusual noises end. Thank you so much stopping by, Detective Siegel. It's so thoughtful of you. Goodbye. Do you mind if I just take a look at that leak? - I'm sorry? - This leak here. How long has this been going on for? Um, I don't know. When was the last time any maintenance was done on the house? Oh, I don't know. My grandparents were the ones taking care of the maintenance. You'll have to excuse me. I'm just... I'm still in mourning. My condolences again, Miss Peters. It's terrible how they passed together and so suddenly. Oh! Don't worry about that. I've got it. I... I'll get it. I remember these two. You girls were inseparable. Whatever happened to them? - Well, I don't know. - You don't keep in touch? - No. - Really? Why not? My grandparents believed them to be a poor influence on me. Yes, of course. They were on a TV show not too long ago. Did you see it? No. I didn't grow up with television. It's odd though, don't you think? After all this time, not a single phone call or an email. No, I don't own a computer. Right. Probably for the best. Those girls... they're no good, Miss Peters. They're dangerous, let me tell you that. They're not dangerous. They're geniuses. Even my grandparents didn't understand poetry like they do. They're brilliant. - Hmm. I understand. - No. - No, you don't know them. - Miss Peters... You don't know them like I know them! - I'm not trying to upset you. - No! No! The world never deserved them. The outside world always rejected them! Rejected? Now you're going to see what it's like... to live without them. Where are they? Where are they? I don't... No! What? How'd you know they went missing? Um... Their disappearance isn't national news, Miss Peters, so you couldn't have read about it. You don't have a TV, you don't have a computer, you never leave the house. You just told me that they haven't contacted you in years, so how would you have known that they went missing? Miss Peters? Officer, may I see your search warrant, please? Because if you don't have one, I suggest you leave. Right now. Unless you want me to call the police station and tell them you've spent your afternoon searching the home of the town lunatic! You're close to retirement, aren't you, Detective Siegel? If I were you, I'd wanna retire with a little dignity. If I get any more complaints, Miss Peters, I'm gonna have to come back with a warrant. But you won't mind. It's not like you're hiding two fugitives in your attic. Par... Pardon me? That's right. They're not just missing. They're wanted, Miss Peters. But I understand your need to protect them. But in the end... who's gonna protect you from them? Take care. Now no one can come in. I will always keep you safe. I promise. Now, please, sit. Oh, Tilda, go wash your hands first. Doctor. Doctor, I know what you're here for. And I've been dying to play. Into our rotting mansion's halls, look for signs along the way. You'll waltz about with my dolls, and let the mirror end your days. But caution, dear Doctor, for you're not too far from hell. And the grave will open wide when you shatter time's spell! - Time's spell? - But, but... if you finish the game before me, I'll let you go, and I'll take the blame. The blame for what? What are you talking about? The grave will open wide! What? Whose grave? Our rotting mansion's halls! - Where's Tilda? - Oh, Doctor! Dear Doctor, it's too late. What did you do? Tilda! It's too late. Oh, my God, Tilda. The grave will open wide when you shatter time's spell. - What? - Just listen to the riddle, and you'll find the clues to the safe, okay? - Just go. - Daughter, where are you? Just go. Go find the safe. Go. We're running out of time. Just go. Darling! Stop bothering the poor doctor. Go on, Doctor. Go waltz about with my dolls. Go waltz about with my dolls. Go waltz about with my dolls. Our rotting mansion's halls. Rotting mansion's halls. Rotting mansion's halls, rotting mansion's halls. Rotting mansion... Come on. Fuck. Into our rotting mansion's halls, look for signs along the way. Look for signs along the way. And let the mirror end your days. Let the mirror end your day. Let the mirror end your day. "Shatter time's spell." Shatter time's spell. What does that mean? Come on, how do you shatter time's spell? Petula is still trying to escape. Daphne will get her. Daphne always gets her. I got it. I got it. I found it. - What? - The safe. I found the safe. No, it's okay. She agreed to it. - Agreed to what? - To letting us go. We found the safe. We can keep the money. We can keep all of her inheritance. Come on. Then we can commit her. - But how? - What do you mean, how? We can pay Coco back. We can move out of that shitty crack cave we live in. Come on, this is a new, fresh fuckin' start, Tilda. Come on, get your shit. We are getting out of here tonight. Come on. Shit. Watch yourself. Petula, hold up! Slow down! Hey! Hey, hey! Stop! Are you fucking kidding me? Fucking asshole! No. Fuck! You wanna fucking help me? Not just sit there? What do you want me to do? What am I supposed to do? Help me! Help me flag down one of the fucking cars! It's not gonna make a difference if I stand up or not. - I'm fucking tired! - I'm fucking tired, Tilda! - Come on! - Just shut the fuck up. - Are you serious right now? - Nobody's fucking out here. Just get off your fucking ass and help... Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Where's Tilda? Oh, she's in bed. Would you like to see her? You said if we found the safe, then you'd let us go. I said you could go. And I said you had to finish the game first, and you haven't. She's awake. Would you like me to take you to her? No. There we are. Tilda? Daughter. Hello, dearest. Say hello, darling. Darling girl, don't be rude. Oh, this night is so exhilarating. You know, it reminds me... of the night... that I poisoned my grandparents. They wanted to get me a caretaker. Like I was some kind of crazy person. No, Mother. Mother, please don't. Mother, please, please don't. Mother, please! You, keep your eyes open. I haven't taken those yet. Daphne, no. Take that away, Grover. - Harrison. - What you got, Mort? Guy says he's seen the missing girls. - Oh, yeah? - Outside the train station. They look mermaids on crack. You seen these two girls? You positive? Yeah. Them's the mermaids. Now, where's my reward? You also see flying cats, you quack. How long ago? Come on. - You're not a bum? - No. Get outta here. Get him outta here. Hello, Tilda. Petula. I've come to tell you that the game is over. So you can go now. It's been fun. Oh. Before I go, a goodbye gift. Drug dealers, huh? You know, maybe they won't recognize you with the scars. Well, you wanted to leave so badly, so why don't you just leave? Clear this room immediately! There's lots to be done before the baby comes. These walls need to be repainted and... What the fuck are you talking about, Daphne? I'm sorry? You're not pregnant, you psycho bitch. You can't be. You're insane. You know that, right? I mean, you must know that. Please keep your voice down. The stress isn't good for the baby. What baby? There's no baby. You're barren. I feel it. I feel it kick in the night. In the night, it kicks and... Shut the fuck up, Daphne. What kind of mother do you think you'd be? - It kicks in the night. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, are you listening to yourself? He comes in the night, and he's coming tonight. He's coming tonight for all of us! There's no baby coming. You're not a mother. You're a monster. This is not happening. It's not real. Thank you. I always knew I'd be an excellent mother. Daphne, wake up. I am awake! It's everyone else that's asleep! Now, get out! - Well, then whose baby is it? - Get out! Answer me, Daphne! Whose baby is it? Say it! It's Doctor's. Oh, my God. Ma'am, would you like to follow me to my office? It's an urgent matter regarding your pregnancy. We're gonna have to take you to surgery immediately. Freeze! Drop 'em. Drop it! Put your hands on the back of your heads. Put your hands on the back of your heads now! Take a step back. Turn around. Step back and get on your knees. I'm so sorry, Tilda. I'm so, so, so sorry. What's the problem, Officer? No, no. Fuck. The car. Doctor, more tea? Yes, please. Thank you. Tilda, stop! Stop it with the tapping! Go fast! Go faster already! ♪ Figaro ♪ ♪ Figaro ♪ Tilda! Daughter? Daughter? Mother? Daughter? Tilda? Tilda, it's not funny. I saw him! No, I just saw him! - Who did you see? - Siegel! He was right there! I just saw him! Oh, Doctor. We just like the idea of someone looking for us. Let's go paint. Tilda? Tilda. Tilda, darling. Daughter. Tilda! "Tilda and Petula get on a train to go to Daphne's house. Petula flirts with the train conductor to get him to pay for the ride. Daphne is waiting for us at the house. Daphne's always waiting for us. Patiently, she knows we'll always come back every time because of her safe, safe, the safe, find the safe. Petula's still trying to run away and sabotage the game. She does it every time, then we pretend she escaped. We let her go and start over. Now we have a punishment for breaking rules. Punishment for breaking the rules." I'm glad you found it. Maybe now things will be easier. - What things? - All things. I mean, maybe now we can play without you worrying about you running away. Run away, forget, come back. Run away, forget, come back. - What? - You always come back. How long have I been here? You mean this round? This round? What? You should look at your arms. What? One for every time you ran away. - How many rounds? - You should sit down. How many rounds! Answer me! I need to leave! - Why don't you sit down and... - I need to leave. - No, no, no, no! - I need to leave! - You can't leave, Petula! - Tilda! - No, no, no! - Tilda! Tilda, we need to leave. Tilda, come on! Come on! Tilda, I don't know what's going on. I told you this wouldn't work. That's because you're being too light on her. Please. We need to go. Go to your room, Daphne. Please. Tilda. Please. Please. - It's Coco. - Answer it. They took the stuff. - All of it. - All of it. - It's a miracle we got away. - It's a miracle we got away. - About 80 worth last night. - About 80 worth last night. We were almost done weighing and packaging it. I literally had no time to sell any of it, I swear. I don't understand. What does Coco look like, Petula? I don't know. I've never seen him. Oh, really? What day do you think it is? Don't you understand? Petula, you aren't fit for the outside world. We have everything we need here. We've money, food, comfort, safety. No bills, no depressing office jobs, no stress, no problems, nothing. Out there, it's chaos. It's miserable. Here, we're home. We're home. 107, 108, 109, 110. That's the last one. 22 plus 44 plus 20 equals... I don't know if I'm good anymore. What if I'm not as talented and as extraordinary as I like to think I am? Like I say I'm an actor, and I fool people into thinking that's my job, and then, what, some of them even fuckin' believe it. And that's it? I'm an actor? It's a fuckin' farce. It's not real. What's gonna happen when we realize we're not, we're not gonna fuckin' make it? What do I do? What do I do? You ready? Come with me. Come with me, Petula. Come on. Come with me. Dream. Please dream. Dream of everything. Dream of all the things you want, the places you'll go, the person you're meant to be. Before it's too late. Dream forever, for time in dreams is frozen. Oh, yes, sleep. May the night wash us over completely into that new day, into the new world. And may your dreams make your life. Tomorrow. The grave will open wide when you'll shatter time's spell. I'm getting really tired. I wanna go to bed. It's late. Yeah, I wanna go to sleep. Hey, Mom. Subtitles by explosiveskull
