JOB'S REVOLT ~ Who wants a fat one? ~ Fat ones are always lazy. Which one will you choose? That one, maybe. How about these boys? I recommend one of these, Mr. Job. I'm risking my post as it is. What about this little blond boy? He came to the orphanage last year, he's the market-place saddler's son. His parents were consumptive. They're a sickly pair,... and we're offering two fine calves, Mr. Lawyer. Don't be too choosy, Madam. As it is, I'll have to backdate the adoption papers five years,... to 1938. This child wasn't born then. Jews can't adopt children these days. Especially not Christian youngsters, Mr. Lawyer. That's just what I want:... a Christian, to whom I can leave everything. Take me, please! Show me that one --- that's him. He bites like a rabid fox. Lord save us from the likes of him. ~ Don't interfere, R?za. I'll soon break him in. ~ He's a good one, Mr. Job. He's a bit wild, but he was in a sheep-pen that burnt down. It's no wonder he's unruly. But he's got a way with animals. He's a bit pale. So we've bought him ---... the lawyer will make out the papers. I'll want his baptismal certificate, as well. Keep still! Let me go! Quit squirming. ~ He's a wild one, very wild. ~ R?za! We'll sign the calves over to you. We'll drink to it at the Corona restaurant. If any harm comes to him, you'll be responsible! Where are you taking me? I won't go! Keep still, calm down. Behave yourself! Control yourself. Hey, you, hey! Quite an offspring. You chose well, Job. You don't choose offspring --- the Lord gives them. Come on up here. Leave him alone. Come on, then if you haven't got a master. This is our day for proliferation. I've had enough. It's either the dog, or the child, or me! The child --- the dog comes with him. You must be deranged. This is a little wild animal! I saw that when we bought him. I wouldn't have it any other way! The Lord transplanted a spark of life from the calves to him... to give us a sign, so we would recognize him. The old cow would have done,... they'd have exchanged him for her. What? For those withered udders? If instead her spark had been transplanted,... he'd be sitting quietly. Hear that? She wants to outwit the Lord. A sheep would have done. Why not say he's worth only a goose? Come on, jump. Hup! Walk on your own feet. Listen, hey! My goodness,... Oh, damn it. Off you go among the sheep. First you praise the Lord, then you do this. When the Lord gives a child, he gives worry, too. If anyone asks whose son you are... say you belong to Uncle Job, who bought you for two fine calves. And say at once: "I'm not a Jew!" ~ You're teaching him that? ~ Yes. Bring the crook. Quickly. Help him from the right. From the right. Leave it to the dog. Stop. Stop. For Christ's sake! They are running towards the mud flats. From the right. Stop! Stop, you! Damn it! We won't get home by the Sabbath. Jani? Ilka, where's Jani? Aunt R?za, he wanted to touch my breast. Only to look at it! Godless creature. If you touch the girl again, I'll send you away! A child needs to be born each day --- your body knows that well, R?za. ~ Hey, stop! ~ Let me go! Jani, run after him! Catch him! After him! What's up? Is it water you want, you crazy kid? Leave me alone. You're soaking wet. Jani's wet, too. Lack?, from now on you and your dog will live with us. It'll be a good place, you'll see. This is the house. This is Mama and I'm Papa. Some milk. I'm sure you're hungry. Don't want it! That's a pity, Lack?, the milk's gone. Don't cry, I don't like it. Don't cry. Don't cry. ~ Good Sabbath. ~ Good Yomtov. You and your dog will be better off in the stable ---... you'll try the house later on. Come on. I won't go! ~ Why not? ~ I'm afraid. Don't be afraid. It's the Sabbath and we have to light candles for God. Who's that? That's...that's...come on! God is shut into the Jewish temple on Saturday... because that's the Sabbath. How heavy you are! On Sunday, He's in the Protestant church... because it's the Lord's supper. ~ But don't tell anyone. ~ Why not? ~ That's Carnation. ~ Let's feed her. We'll let him free later. ~ All right, who? ~ God, of course, hey. All right, but why? If you like, I'll eat this flower. Without salt! If you like, I'll eat one, too. I'll eat this ant, too! Mama R?za will be cross if you eat ants. Spices, hardware, salt --- everything on one stall, ladies! Our entire life was a struggle for an heir. Seven gravestones in the cemetery! This woman gave birth seven times and we had seven funerals. It's enough! You say that to the Almighty? We have nothing more to discuss. Enough, indeed. We have nothing to wait for. Mendele... why did the Lord consign my seven children to Egypt? Let me go. I don't hear what you are saying, you're blasphemous. Don't be sly, Job Have I complained? We raised chickens, sheep, geese. But I'd like to raise at least one man for the Lord. I won't die before then --- but maybe we're too late. The angel of death has descended upon the people of Israel. A worse slavery is waiting for us than in Babylon, Rabbi. Don't interrupt, R?za. The Polish peddler said... that Hitler brought more danger than young Daniel ever faced. We have no time left. If the Creator asks me if I have fulfilled myself,... will you answer for me? Yes, He gave me no offspring,... so I got one to fulfill myself. But you got a goy child. And if he's the Messiah? Jew or goy, any boy can be the Messiah. You could have bought one of Braun's fifteen children. All boys! All cross-eyed. The Lord gave them to Braun. But he gave me calves, so I bought a little man with them. Yes. Uncircumcised. What's a little foreskin matter to the Creator? He'll circumcise him if He wishes. If Israel survives... I can't die without knowing a descendant will survive me. Given by Your will, by Your will taken away. Eternal one, why was I not allowed to raise them? How did my lambs sin? Preserve him for all eternity. Who are you speaking about? Enrich his life with their lives. Let him survive us on the merits... of these little saints, Lord.... Are you talking about the calves? May your life-giving sparks enable him... to grow to the starry sky. Ennoble the abject, tame the wild. Be my companion, Lord. Dorka! Dorka! Where's the boy? He went into the reeds --- Ilka and I brought him back. He's like a wild fox so I locked him in here! In there!? Well, he was there. You wretched donkey! You were with the dead. You wouldn't interrupt your prayer. I warned you. You are calling in vain --- he's lost! He went into the reeds. Ilka and I brought him back. He's worth two calves. You should have been damned instead. I'll deduct the boy from your wages, you can be sure. He could be drowned. Get out of the marsh, R?za, dear. Ours was a reckless joy. Premature. Lack?! Go home, R?za! The little fellow's been eaten by catfish. Now you bewail your offspring --- before, it was the calves. Lack?! That's it: the descendant of the calves. You're a conceited, spendthrift, silly peasant. Feather-brained, skinflint woman. If I were the Creator, I'd plague your sheep! Don't touch me. I'd rather drop dead. You drop dead, too. Cheer up. One of the calves had a cataract. That's some consolation. Why didn't you tell me before? Lack?! Old cheat, we've got our deserts. You want to meddle in everything. Even the Almighty hasn't patience enough for you,... jabbering old woman! Let us look at the Torah of our Moses... on the day of reconciliation. If you have wronged each other, forgive each other now. The Lord will forgive you,... because forgiveness is necessary. Now the lesson. When, on Mount Sinai... the Almighty gave Moses the Commandments. He uttered another supreme Commandment just for Moses... "Take care of yourself, Moses." And I say that we are surely responsible for this war... every man, you and me, we are all responsible. And woe to those who invite danger by creating dissent. You are the Lord's sole companion. The eye of the world is upon you, as if in a mirror. "Your loving mother. Your brother sends his regards." ~ Won't you write something for your grandchild? ~ I don't know any letters. Then draw a rosemary or a tulip. You write their letters for nothing... and you even buy the stamps. Terike, your husband has fallen. Where will you send it? Where is he now, Uncle Job? Nowhere? No, he's in the next world. ~ Write there, then. ~ Come to the shop tomorrow. Have I any hope? I'd do anything for him. Then there is hope. My man's so sickly, he's bound to perish at the front. Write that. Ladies, has no one got any good news? ~ Have you a license to do this? ~ I'm only writing letters. Why should I have a license for that? Stop, you! Don't be afraid of them. You've got nothing to fear. ~ I want to go home. ~ He wants to go home. We'll be home before long. "Let's hit the Jews with a stick. "One rabbi, two rabbis, the chief rabbi was bumped off." Leave us in peace. We have a right to be in this county at this fair. "Long live Sz?lasi and Hitler! Let's hit the Jews with a stick..." To the Creator,... the Deputy Town Clerk is but a flea, biting and jumping. Come away. What he's doing is wrong. ~ He's a bad man? ~ No, but he's done a bad thing. But if they're stuck together, you need cold water. Even so, they're obeying God's command. Where is God? In the acts of love in the pastures. He gives light, like glow-worms. ~ Is He in a frog, too? ~ Yes, they croak nicely. We'll go to the river and listen, shall we? What are you doing? Are you mad? I'm seeking God. You're seeking God and I'm seeking Ilka. But Ilka can be seen. She certainly can. I'm enduring great suffering. Very great. Are you ill? Who's in this? God, perhaps? ~ No, I see Ilka. ~ But she's not there. I see her there. And if I look up, I see her there. But there isn't a cloud... like a human face. I've a sort of illness... where the front of my chest hurts like the bones are bursting out. Do you have a cough? No. Then it's not consumption, luckily. ~ That Ilka is the sort of girl...she's like... ~ Like? ~ Well, like other girls, but... ~ But? but even so, the sun can't touch her. She accidentally dropped her brother... into the well while drawing water. That's why she likes children so much. I could cry out in pain and still be happy if it hurts. That's how this illness is. I've gone quite crazy. You're just like the ram ---... if the ewe stands still, he has to mount her. Maybe. Why don't you make Ilka a child? You're grown up now. Jani. You know how to do it,... it's not difficult --- just copy the cock or the stallion! Look. ~ Jani! ~ Can't you see he's just playing? I brought this dance back from the front. What's that? The front? A hunt. ~ People shoot each other, but not out of anger. ~ Why? Because the officers think they should. Like this, see? Dorka! See, Dorka, God is in this dance, too! This is prayer, too. That's why he can't talk while she's doing it. Like Papa. Papa, I'm going off with Dorka while the flock's resting. Go home to Mama,... there'll be trouble if you just wander around, you know. Where are you taking that? You'll see. It's a big surprise. Papa will be pleased with you. You were lucky. Look, there's a big one. Grab it! Careful! Hey, you'll scare them away! Papa will be pleased with you. Don't jump away. They must be after the Polish deserter. Is he a water-sprite? No, a runaway soldier. The pastor takes him food. So does your father. Mama said so. Dorka, they should be ashamed. Those rotten dogs! Have you seen a man around here? A man? Never. Me? I haven't either. I have to pee. I've been to Vienna and looked at the oven's crack. There sits an old woman dressed in black. Leave me alone. Who's that? Maybe it's the front. Don't be afraid. If you like I can eat a flower, an ant, even a wasp! The circus has arrived. Come along, all of you! You'll see a miracle this evening at Mr. Berger's inn. The circus is here! Come to Berger's inn this evening. Five ears of corn or five eggs for adults,... three ears of corn or two eggs for children. Come see a miracle! Come see a miracle for yourselves! Illusion and cinema! Which one's the boy? They're both boys --- or both girls. No, the taller is the boy. Illusion and cinema in Berger's inn! Come see a miracle! "Illusion and cinema! "'The Frozen Child'. "At Mr. Berger's inn." Will they freeze a child at the inn? They won't freeze anyone. Good evening. Sir, madam, this is the very best place Where's our place? We brought ten extra ears, for a good place. Naturally. We were waiting for you. We were waiting for you. ~ For us? ~ Naturally. The cinema is for everybody. The marvel will soon begin. ~ Where's the frozen child? ~ Be patient. Light! Why has gone dark? Keep still, or we'll be in trouble. I'm going blind! Is that shooting out light, too? Don't look back. It's a sort of motor-bike. Is this the illusion? Quiet! Hey you, this is the illusion? It certainly is. They cut off his head, like the Polish deserter in the reeds. Is this the other world, or what? Fear not, art isn't dangerous for good people... only for bad people. Look at that! Snow in summer! Is it snowing in the bar? My honored public, it's unseemly to laugh. You can see quite clearly... that everyone has suffered. Everyone, my honored public. The orphan embraces his mother's gravestone. Where is he hiding? Show something funny. Let's have a laugh! Fear not, this is only an illusion. The frozen child! How stupid. How stupid! Making people cry and charging for it! This is panic-mongering! Incitement! Silence! Lights on! This is only a movie. Are you Jews, by any chance? This is deception! Drifters who deceive the public belong in jail! I forgot all about you. Let Papa have some fun --- he missed the evening illusion. Ilka. Dorka. They'll suffocate. He'll smother that girl! Why do it, if you don't know how? They're stuck together. Carnation, they're stuck together! They're like the dogs at the fair, it hurts them. Thank God, that worked! Wait 'til I catch you! You could have been stuck like that! I'll tear you to pieces! You're blaming me,... but the gypsy boy and the circus man knew how to do it! You should have watched the rooster! They'll wake up! You're stupid. I'll tell on you. Come back here! Oh dear! Get away! How did they get here? I separated them with cold water. They should be grateful! You did wrong. I told that you mustn't extinguish love with water. This cinema or whatever it is has upset them. I said it was profane. Cover yourself! Stop going on like that, R?za! Don't kill them in the kitchen! I was frightened by the illusion, that's why I went to Jani. Papa, see how lovely they are. I brought them all for you. ~ Look, Mama, what lovely frogs I caught! ~ Take it away! Take it to Papa! Look, Papa! You little rascal. As for you, braid your hair, you hussy. Papa, this girl's four months gone. Hallelujah! We're proliferating! Every morning the Lord asks whether I've been truly Job... working for Him... ~ helping Him to redeem the world. You follow me? ~ No. Only a bad shepherd-boy runs --- the dogs do the running! Fly away. Fly away, my little dove. Have you gone mad? I just saw God. Over there! Don't be afraid... that's only G?nther, the Swabian mendicant friar. Praised be, Uncle Job! You scared this boy to death! Poor bird! Her wing is broken. She's nesting up there. Come along. ~ What are you doing? ~ Pulling my donkey. Why isn't he pulling you? He pulls me, I pull him, it's fifty-fifty. You think that's funny? We shepherds believe that God is present in a donkey, too. Saint Francis said that first, you're just imitating him. Our shepherd rabbi said it first. Now let's catch the ferry. Don't strike the lambs of God. ~ I'm troubled, G?nther. ~ It will pass. ~ Only if you help. ~ I might. I want to give everything to this goy child. Even things I can't give him. Time is running out for me. I heard of something in your churches... something like you just said. Something about a lamb. The Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. Teach him that only. That's all there is. There is no more. All right then. You'll get as many potatoes as you and your donkey can carry. That's good, very good. Look, Papa! I'll have potatoes for five years! ~ Where's the boy? ~ He was just here. G?nther is giving religious instruction... and here you're handling money. You ought to be ashamed of this religious instruction. That, too, R?za. Can we add it to my account? You'll pay me later. Lack?, I'm talking to you. Am I paying potatoes for this? The cock's always here. I'm watching even though I shouldn't be. Come here, you rascal. You're quite the gonif! Sit down. Listen. Now tell him the lamb thing. Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world, have mercy... have mercy upon us. But where is He? Tell me, then you can go. ~ You're the shepherd. ~ No potatoes for you, then. I'll teach him knots --- I know at least ten. He'll find them useful, with God's help. True, we were caught up in debate,... disputing many things. If you pray through work, the Creator and the boy will both understand. True. Now listen. Yeah, all right. Adam and Eve are like two plums. He's eating honey. Blessed be the Lord. He freed the seed from the earth... the lamb from the ewe, Israel from slavery. Is that you, Papa? Surely Papa isn't God? Don't leave my only boy in the dark land of Egypt ---... be with him when we are gone. Aren't you thirsty, Papa? Be his companion when he is left alone again as an orphan. Dorka, Papa's either gone mad, or he's been attacked by love. Dorka, see how well Jani can do it now. Jani, Papa's gone mad! Get away from here at once! Go on! He's in the Sukkoth's tent. If you keep doing it so much,... you'll have enough kids to fill an orphanage! Get away! I'll tell Mama you ate an ant. Can't you sleep? Did you have a bad dream, little fellow? Why do they keep doing it? The bull and the stallion do it only once. You've been spying again. Papa will be cross with you tomorrow. People are not bulls Everyone has a different flower on his plate. The pastor has married Ilka and Jani now. Ilka is Jani's wife according to the law. Hallelujah! You sent rain in answer to my prayer,... so raise this little boy. Hallelujah! Just as you sent the rain this night,... so raise this boy. Papa is in the Sukkoth's tent, getting soaked with rain. What a good thing we put the tent by the window this year. Don't you go out in the rain! ~ Such a boy! ~ Papa! Papa! Mine! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Eat, little scamp. Sweeten you whole life with honey. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! You sent rain in answer to my prayer, Lord. Hallelujah! Into the house now. The little creature will catch cold! I want to stay with Papa! Don't meddle, R?za. You're letting the little one catch cold, old man. I can't breathe. It's all right. I'll take you into my bed, my one and only. Come along, come along, my boy. Lay him in my bed. We'll put you in Papa's bed. Come, my treasure. Help me, Ilka. Jani will soon be back with Doctor Klein. He'll help the good Lord. Try to drink a little. Doesn't matter. Wipe it up. Try a bit, just a little. Wipe him, good. I'll cook onion soup, it might help. Soon, soon, my dear. Don't you worry... I killed him when it rained at Sukkoth's --- that's when he caught cold. No, this isn't a cold, it's diphtheria. We can sit shivah, Mama. All right, my little fellow, all right. The second and fifth died of diphtheria. We'll bury the eighth, too. Don't fall into the sin of despair, Job. Don't take him back, Almighty. Our time has run out. Just this one, don't take him back. I won't give him up. I won't sacrifice this one. I am not Abraham, I'm just a village shepherd. Send the fiery angel for me, but I'm not giving him up! You keep pacing. ~ Doctor Klein is away in town. ~ Phone for an ambulance. There's no phone until morning. Take the boy. Sit down in the chair. Get the petroleum. You'll paint his throat with petroleum? You'll kill him! Make chamomile tea. Hold his head! He'll suffocate. The Lord didn't even ask Abraham to sacrifice his son... but now you're doing it. Dorka... Don't be afraid. I'm here. ~ Nasty frog. ~ It was only a dream. No creatures of the Earth are ugly. Remember the nice frogs you brought for Papa once? Come in, Mendele. Come in. How are you, Mama R?za? The Lord has visited me in old age as he did Hannah,... Samuel's mother. Thanks be to the Creator. I am truly happy. Welcome, dear guests. Kati! I brought an apple cake, Lack?. ~ Some bean casserole for my neighbor. ~ Thank you. A fine, clever son. He'll give you no trouble. Blessed be the Lord. We'll bury this together. Only you will know where, not even Jani, or Ilka. Look here. Look, Mama. You can buy a whole house for this gold watch. You'll live in it... with your sons and wife. You can buy knowledge with the rings. Buy books. Not a word to Papa! You know books make him angry. He says they spoil the eyes. He only loves prayers and sheep. Can I tell Dorka? No one. Be clever when you are left on your own. If you're asked, don't say a word to anyone. But I don't want to be on my own. Every child is left on his own one day. The parents go away. Where? Away. Far away. Wait a moment. See this ring with the beautiful stone? It was given to grandfather by the great Kossuth. Here, look at it. Because Kossuth was cured by the rabbi when he was ailing,... you know. ~ Who do you like best, Papa or Mama? ~ Mama. You like Mama best? Papa is listening in the doorway. Why fill the boy with such nonsense? Anyway...my great-grandfather got it from Kossuth, not yours. You see this thimble? I will leave it to you. A cobbler uses it to sew soles to uppers. It can bind Adonai to the world. ~ That's your inheritance. ~ Go out, R?za. Who do you like best, your mama or your papa? Papa. You said different. I like Mama best and Papa best. There are the three of us. You rascal. You're wanted, old man. It's the neighbors. They said you were dead. Did you die? Maybe. I had diphtheria. I'm not going back to the front. I must care for them. Let's help the Creator, J?nos. Sometimes God and man together are enough. The Deputy Town Clerk issues exemption papers to farmers. Then he shares out the bribe... with the gendarmes and the chief constable. Take this watch to the Deputy Town Clerk. Buy your life. Now away with you, my children. How lovely they are. They're mine. We'll bury them, but don't tell anyone. Silly old man, you rob your only descendant. Go away from here quickly --- this disease is catching. Catching? Yes, catching, my boy. Old rascal. Papa. In the next world the Redeemer won't ask if I was Moses. but whether I was Job. He'll ask you whether you were Lack?... and whether you're on your own again. I don't want to be on my own. I told Mama. If you are on your own, cut a willow bough... and hit a milestone till the evil passes,... till the Redeemer comes. You'll calm down because you'll have a companion. I don't need one. Men, animals, plants all feel,... but the milestone cannot feel. Beat it until the willow bough is worn out. This will be yours one day. I'll leave you this knife. When you've grown wise and you need it,... it will always be with you. I'm afraid, Papa. Don't be afraid because you'll be grown up one day. And don't look back at the cart... or you'll be turned into a pillar of salt like Lot. What cart? Don't look back at any cart. Say to yourself, Lord, am I. You are you. Then the Messiah will come to you. Rotten Jew! Bastard boy! Fight back, Lack?! And he isn't a bastard. Mama R?za bore him in town. Fight back, Lack?! Fight back! What's it matter if someone's a Jew? Don't let him, Lack?! ~ Rotten Jew! ~ Yes, I am a Jew! What have you done, you rascal? What have you done? This boy's father wrote letters for your mother to send to the front! Get home with you this very instant! You, too. You'll get into trouble at home for this. Breaking a window! That stupid Kov?cs broke the window with this stone. Do you see? With this one, do you see, Mama? All right, my sweet. I'm selling without customers, R?za. I'm writing letters to our soldiers...in the next world. Lie down, or you'll be kicking out Mama and me. The boy's got more sense than you have. Off you go and play, my boy. A keepsake for him. Rejoice, my heart,... the peasant Job has conquered Israel's murderer. Like our splendid King David,... the peasant Job has outwitted the Philistine dolt Adolf Hitler. Go out and play, my boy. Don't wail, Mama. We'll both of us hold him under the arms. It used to be like this on the farm in the old days. As long as he doesn't lose his temper... He's only been like this once before. and that was out of joy, too. At our wedding. Mazeltov! The cock is crowing, soon it will be dawn. A bird walks through the green woods and the flat meadows. May I have the pleasure of dancing with the lovely bride? Don't you swagger about... If only you'd broken the glasses in our wedding tent... we wouldn't have been blessed with a child so late. Mazeltov! Now come on stamp on it, my little bull. My lace, Papa! We've got a descendant, R?za. We have denied death. Just one or two more years. Next year he'll start school. That's all I ask. And to bake his wedding bread,... nothing's enough for you, old woman! Taub Eizik, the Tsadik, was a shepherd, just like us. If he laid his hands on a barren ewe, she would then conceive. So people who want offspring make pilgrimages here... from far and wide. How do they make that noise? It's a rattle. I'll buy you one. Come, come, keep in line nicely. Brethren, a pilgrimage should be orderly. You of the new faith should respect the orthodox Hasidim. Let us not be quarrelsome. Let us be unified at the grave of the sage, at least. Bring back my son from the front, Tsadik! ?ron will write petitions for anyone with an empty paper. We'll forward your petitions to the sage. For our family, Tsadik! Come on, please. One at a time, ladies. Peace. What do you see? I see a fish with shining scales... and a cock and a shofar. Can you see them, too, Papa? We, too, are shepherds, Tsadik. Just grant us one more year. Just one. We'll take the petitions. Grant us a few more years. Hope, like the tips of poplars at harvest time... is drenched with sun. Behold our son. Don't let them take him from me, Tsadik. Don't take him away from me. For our family, rabbi. Don't be silly. That was enough... You ought to keep repeating the prayer. We'll drink four times. Elijah the Prophet's glass will be ready,... in case he should come. And if he doesn't? Answer Papa's questions cleverly, let him be happy. Don't be naughty. Not at all. If you get stuck in the prayer,... you won't get a present this evening. The star has risen. Blessed be the evening of Seder. so that our offspring can walk in Your furrow, Lord... in eternal Passover towards the happiness of mankind. "Bajre pri hagufen." Bring the water. Papa. My son... This evening the three of us are still together. I can't go on lying, Mama. Somebody is very anxious to steal the present... from under your cushion. Very anxious, the little rascal. Why are you crying, Papa? "Manistanu." Why is this evening different from other evenings? This evening teaches us that... that with our love we supplement... the love of the world, its faults... Whisper it, Mama. I'll learn it better by tomorrow, Papa! I'll learn it better by tomorrow, Mama! Don't torture the boy,... let your tears usefully water the flowers. Now look for the present. Where have you hidden it, Papa? You little rascal. Mama, here's the matzoh. It's the knife. That means I'm big now. Now it will always be with you... so you can cut a willow bough and say:... "I, Lord, am I. You are You." Then the Messiah will come. Just look for him. Mama, I've got the knife. Does it really mean I've grown up? I won't give you up! They can't take you away from me! Mama! No God and no man has the right to do that! They have no right to this infamy! They can't take him away from me! Teach your son about this day as his heritage. You have fulfilled the laws of Moses. We can freely leave now. Where to? Open the window, in case Elijah has arrived. He travels by donkey like G?nther the friar. Catch hold of the donkey's tail. I can see him. So can I. ~ Can you see him? ~ I see him, too. Elijah the Prophet has visited us. You have seen him this evening. You see, old woman? You needn't make such fuss --- you'll open the shop, anyway. Watch out, we don't want to knock anything down! The pastor promised to help us. Damask bed linen, we never used it. Two for you, the rest for the boy. It's lovely. My mother wove these tablecloths. What nonsense you talk, R?za. ~ Keep them for feast days. ~ Yes. Mama? Mama? What's the matter? I'm thirsty. Thirsty? Here, have a drink. Have I got diphtheria? No, it's just a bad dream, my little fellow. Take the menorah to the other house... it should stay with the boy. Don't shake them or they'll go bad. I'm suffocating. Let's get the boy out of this chaos. Do as I say. Where are those toy soldiers going? Go to sleep. We're just having a very bad dream. A very bad dream. Sleep. ~ Will this be all right here? ~ Yes. Where's Papa? Papa isn't here. Where's Papa? Nowhere. Don't be so fidgety. Have I got diphtheria? No. You'll be living with us from now on. Papa bought this house... for us. Don't. You'll kick the baby from her tummy. I'll bake you some nice apple cake. And we'll cook some nice beans, too. Mama? With goose breast. And stuffing. Where's Mama? ~ Nowhere. ~ Nowhere. Run after him! Stop! Let me alone. You'll be living here now. I'm going home. Where's Dorka? You? She's here --- Dorka isn't a Jew. Why not? She IS a Jew. Leave the dog now, come on. Oh God! Run, Dorka! You can't go to the house. Dorka! Run! ~ Stop! ~ Leave him to hell. Come on, Dorka. Mama! Hey, Mama. Papa, hey. It's only Dorka and me. It's just us. You can't come here anymore --- you'll live with Jani now. ~ You aren't a Jew. ~ But I am. ~ Go away! ~ Mama, we're here! I don't want to see you. Do you begrudge me the yellow star? Ir?nke said I shouldn't pin one on... do you think I don't know? Mama. Obey Papa, Lack?. Mama. Mama's ill. She asks you not to roam around. Go home to Jani. To hell with them, Dorka. We'll go off into the world... and we won't come back. They can mourn us. Come on, Dorka. You've come at the right time, officers. Lots of girls here. Out of our way, girls. You'll get it clean, we've just bathed in the river. We're ordered to shoot any deserters. Stop fooling around, girls. We're on duty. Dorka, every man falls differently. Every man has a different flower on his plate. Get into your houses! Stop staring! Here's some milk for the baby. Take it. Let her drink. I'll throw you in with them! ~ What are you doing to that woman? ~ What harm have they done you? Kati, where are you going? Lack?! I've been looking for you everywhere. It's better not to look. Why? It just is. What's this disturbance, Pastor? Who will answer for what we are witnessing here, eh? You traitor! Stay out of politics, for God's sake! Stop, you rotten bunch! What's happening here? Into the houses! Disperse! Into your houses! You've got no business here, Pastor! Keep your nose out of it! Get indoors, the lot of you. ~ God be with you! ~ God be with you! Back to the cart, rotten Jew! The Almighty will catch up with you. Woe to you! Come on, hurry up. You scum! Away the carts! You'll answer for this. Mama! Papa! Hey, I'm here! Papa. Why has the cart stopped? Papa, Dorka and I came across the river flats. Papa. Mama. Papa. ~ What are you doing here? ~ Mama, it's me. I told you to wait for the Messiah. What are you loitering around here for? Who is this kid? Do you know him? No, I don't know him. Get started, come on, come on. Mama! Don't worry, Dorka, I've got the knife. Messiah, where are you? Messiah! Hey! Messiah! Messiah!
