Sorry. Morning, Sheriff Edwards. Good morning, Billy Ray. Bet you ain't Never seen a day As pretty as this Back east in... Boston. Actually, Boston can be Quite beautiful Sheriff. Oh Nettie! I'm sorry, mama. Billy Ray's here. I never would Have known. Nettie, no more Billy Ray. It's Mr. Smith, okay? Okay. Morning, Billy Ray. Nettie. Good morning, Mrs. Tuleen. Nettie, you need To be careful. I'll get 'em. You have to take Care of these books. Do you ever think About me, Billy Ray? Of course I do. I usually wonder if You're doing your Homework right. No, I mean Do you ever think Of me as a woman? Someday, you're gonna be A very beautiful woman. In other words, You don't? Let me tell You something. When you're a little girl, All you want is to be a woman. When you're a woman, You realize How important it is To be a little girl. It's different For a man. When he's a boy He needs to behave And mind his folks. But when He's a man He has to stand tall, Speak the truth Make an honest Day's living And be able to look Any other man Straight in the eye Without flinching. Good mornin', Billy Ray. Good morning, charlie. Beautiful mornin' For procreation. "be fruitful and multiply," Sayeth the lord. Billy Ray! Seven minus Three equals... Think about this For a minute, lon. Let's say you had Seven chickens And your neighbor Came over And took away Three of them. How many would You have left? Well, I'd have Seven 'cause My daddy'd Shoot him Before he got out Of the henhouse. I think that's enough Arithmetic for today. Why don't you Sit down? We're starting A new Kid Durango Book today. This is one of my Personal favorites. Is there a girl In this one, billy- I mean, Mr. Smith? Yes, there is, Nettie. Aaawwww! There's something in Here for everyone. We could always Go back to arithmetic. No! Kid Durango of arizona: the dust devils. "the layer of dew That covered "the prairie Disappeared quickly "as the sun rose Over the foothills. "the moon hung Around for a while "and then sunk Far below the ranges. "the day began "like 1,000 other Arizona days. "that was "until the cloud came. "it began on the horizon. "shadows of dust Moving at great speed "and then the pounding hooves on the hard ground. "as the whirlwind Got closer, "you could see Into the dust "the shapes of horses "riders with guns on both hips "and bandoliers across their chests. "they rode hard. "they rode with a purpose. "as they approached The town "they reined back on their horses. "the dust around them settled "and you could See their faces. "faces weathered By the mexican sun. "faces marked By violence. "when the citizens of the town saw the riders "they instinctively Withdrew into "the shadows of The boardwalk. "many of the merchants Went inside "their shops and Locked their doors. "shades came down. "'closed' signs appeared As the town "prepared to look The other way." "it was clear why they were there. "they had an appointment at the bank. "and it wasn't To make a deposit. "they were a ruthless band of thieves "and killers with no Regard for human life. "it was as if They were put "on this earth By the devil "to torment decent God fearing folks "who worked hard to Make an honest living." Just like in the Story, Billy Ray! They got guns! They're comin' this way. Put away everything. Stay in your seats! Come back! Come on, girls. Stay in here! Nettie, move! Move! It's real, Nettie! Let me go! Please put her down! Billy! Seqor, no, Seqor. No! No! Gringo! Wait! Gringo! Billy! Who in the hell was that? They shot harold And Mr. Webb! Where the hell's the Sheriff? Sleepin' probably. Somebody go wake him up! Tell him to round up a posse! The bank! They took the Tuleen girl. Oh, my god! Mount up! Billy Ray? You all right? You're lookin' Kinda peaked. Somebody better Go get the doc. They have my Nettie! Is my daughter there? Can anyone see My Nettie there? Billy Ray, Can you see? My eyes aren't what They used to be. Look at that. Looks like one rider, huh? I don't think there's Anybody on them horses. I see the Sheriff. I swear that's him. Where are the others? Sheriff, you Don't look so good. Somebody get the doc. That's jethro's horse! Where is jethro? There's blood On the saddle. What the hell Happened, Sheriff? Lordy, they've cut Out his tongue. Excuse me, deputy. Did you say that they Cut out his tongue? Here it is, right here. Even if we could Get a posse together, We wouldn't know Where to find 'em. U.S. Government And the Federales Been searchin' For him for years. I'll tell you somethin' About this " El Diablo ." They did find him once. Caught him Down in Amos, That little border town North of Laredo. Caught him, Tried him And hanged him, All in the same night. But he wouldn't die. He just hanged there By his neck, spittin' At the crowd like They disgusted him. Cussed 'em out so bad, The womenfolk Had to go home. I was there when They cut him down. I thank the lord I left when I did. It was three days later, So the story goes El Diablo returned To Amos with his men And cut out the Heart of every man, Woman and child In the whole town And just left them there To bleach in the sun. Soon, they started to rot And then the Buzzards come And started peckin' At their eyes. Spivey, that's Enough of that. Devil don't Never die! No, sir. So no one's Gonna do anything About getting My Nettie back. Probably cut out Her heart and eaten it. Oh, my god. I didn't say nothin' About eating their hearts He just cut 'Em out and left. Spivey! I'm sorry, deputy. Or are you the Sheriff now? Because if you are, It's your responsibility To go after El Diablo. What are you gonna Do about it, Sheriff? At last report, The doc says The Sheriff's feelin' Much better. And I suppose He's been workin' On his sign Language, too? Spivey's right. You're the new Sheriff. We pay your wage. Yeah. Right. I intend to bring Nettie back. I said, I intend to Bring back Nettie. You and who else, Schoolteacher? Me and Kid Durango, That's who. I mean, Kid Durango and I. Charlie, you Got competition. Can't even shoot a gun. I intend to learn To shoot a gun. El Diablo's gonna drop A load of manure in His pants when he sees You comin' at him. I do know one man My second cousin Maggie Sue's brother-in-law J.D. Shoans. He's some kind Of lawman now, Texas ranger. He's supposed to have Rode with Kid Durango. Tell you the truth, We never had all that Much to do with him. Sort of the disgrace Of the family, You know? He shot and killed My cousin Deke About eight years ago up in Sonoma. He also shot And killed My daddy's Brother Edward. Where's he now? The last time I heard, He was up in Millennium. Some kind of marshal Or ranger up there. Hell, ain't but a Turd's difference Between J.D. and The scum he hauls in. But if anybody Could help you Find Kid Durango, It'd be him. You need bigger bottles. You be darn careful Who you show that to. Yes, sir. Sheriff Edwards Wrote you this note. "don't go." Thank him for The advice. You're a darn Fool, Billy Ray. Yes, sir, I know. Come on, Rojo. Only god can kill The devil, Billy Ray. Forward. Billy Ray done shot his horse! my journey did not begin on a good note. I was nonetheless determined to press on. after arranging for transport, I arrived in Millennium three days later. Excuse me. Can you tell me Where I can find A Mr. J.D. Shoans? What do you want With him, sonny? I just have a very Important question I'd like to ask him. You should've Asked him yesterday. All aboard! We are now committing This man, Mr. Jones Mr. Shoans To his life in The hereafter. Let's take a moment To acknowledge His contributions To our community. During his short-lived Term as Sheriff, He served the public to The best of his ability. He shot eight men And three women Most of whom engaged in Breaking the law. I'm sure the others Were honest mistakes. What happened? A friend of yours? Sort of. Yeah. Same here. Sort of. You got business With J.D.? Yeah. I'm the Sheriff now. Maybe I can be of Some assistance. Throw the dirt on him And let's get outta here. Are you related to him? No, sir. I wanna thank you For distractin' them folk. What you lookin' at? You just shot Him in the back. His back was to me. Come on, boy, help Me outta this hole. Come on, Help me up. Besides, he shot J.D. in the back. Just seemed right. He killed J.D.? Yeah. Said he wanted to Be Sheriff real bad. Now he's Sheriff Real bad. Reo here don't like Gunfire. Hurts his ears. Maybe you can Tell me where I can find a man Named Kid Durango? What do you Want him for? They say he's the Fastest gun in the west. Oh, yeah? I wanna hire Him for a job. You got any money? Maybe. Hire me. I ain't as fast as I used to be, But, I cheat Real good. Fast don't mean a Whole lot these days. Us professional Folks are tired Of fightin' fair And dyin' for it. You know Kid Durango? Yeah, I know him. Could you take Me to him? Where are you From, boy? Originally Boston, Massachusetts. I figured. I'm gettin' old, Reo. Maybe you Could help me. Just point me in the right direction, Mr? Van Leek. Thomas Van Leek. I could stay here And draw you a map. But I'd better Move before They start askin' Questions about How the Sheriff Left office. Figure me and Reo Gonna head for Mexico. Mexico? You Know, the man I wish to apprehend Is in Mexico. Mount up. I wouldn't mind Havin' you tag Along for a while. I don't have A horse. I'm sorry, Reo. If you'd be so kind As to leave that Saddle where it is, We'll be on our way. Yes, sir. Just a minute. my contact in Millennium, Mr. Shoans, was shot the day before by Mr. Murphy who was in turn shot while I was conversing with him by a Mr. Van Leek. Mr. Van Leek claims he was a personal acquaintance of Kid Durango. after helping to arrange transportation for me I am accompanying him on his journey to Mexico . i'm counting on him to formally introduce me to Kid Durango when we reach his hideout . How much was you Fixin' to pay this Kid Durango for This job you needed? Whatever the Going rate, The fair rate, Happens to be. You never did say What it was you Needed to be done. Hard to come up With a price If you don't Know that. I want to rescue a Young girl who was Kidnapped by a man Named El Diablo. And I want to Bring him And his compatriots To justice. What's the matter? You can't ride. You can't shoot. You can't Even think, boy. You're in the Wrong territory. Goddamn fool! Come on, Reo. additional details on my trip seemed to discourage Mr. Van Leek from continuing the journey together. I was once again alone, but still determined to pursue my quest. Whoa. Don't let him get away! I got him. Where'd he go? That way. Over there. He's in the gully! I don't see no gully. It's right in Front of you! Sorry. This way, you jackass. Let's go. What's wrong with you? How could he get away? There he is. We got him now, Boys. Split up! I told you the gully. Let me have The first shot! Look, he's goin' In the shitter. Awful big one. That's one of them Three-holers. I saw it in The catalogue. You can't read. Come on, Let's get him. Wait till he gets out. Hell, he might be In there a week. You think we got him? Yeah, but go on Over and make sure. You go. You're closer. The hell I am. Dick's closest. I went first last week. Horseshit. I went first and Got shot, remember? Shut up! But it was only In the head. It still hurt and it Affected my balance. I said shut up! Afternoon. Jesus h. Christ, Van Leek, Don't sneak up like that. I wasn't sneakin'. What do you want? Just passin' through. Got somebody Holed up in there? We do. Snared Up like a rabbit. The boy that shot The Sheriff? Yeah. Does it have a reward? No, we're Just up here Because we wanna See justice done. How much? $400-- $200. Dead or alive. That seems like Enough to go around. I ain't splittin' it More than five ways. I was hopin' that Kid would get lucky And shoot a Couple of us. Why don't you just Back off, Van Leek? Good luck. This won't take But a minute, Reo. Did you guys hear that? Is that a horse? Sure ain't no armadillo. I hear it, But I don't see nothin'. Jake's down. Jake's down. Jesus! Who is that? Let's go. Somebody kill That son of a bitch! That kid's somethin' else. Nice shot, kid. Thank you. There's your new Horse up there. Mr. Van Leek? I'd like to take you Up on your offer To help me get El Diablo. I'll think about it. Come on, Reo. That was an Impressive display Of gunmanship today. Gunmanship? I was wondering If you'd consider Teaching me a few Tricks of the trade. They ain't Tricks, boy. They're means Of death. Here. Don't point that Thing at me, boy. I ain't no horse. Sorry. Pick a star. What? Lay down on Your back. What for? Shut your Goddamn hole, boy, And lay down On your back. Pick a star. Got one. That's enif. Enif? The star you're Fixin' on. It's the brightest Star in pegasus The constellation Of the winged horse. Right there. Don't drop Your look, boy. You gotta Concentrate. Keep your eye fixed On that target, Real steady. I got it. Good. Keep it there Till I tell You to stop. Yes, sir. Good. Drop your eyes From that target, You're a dead man. Patience Concentration The first two things You gotta learn. Got it. You better start Prayin' that wasn't Reo. Bebe? You missed. He missed? I guess the balance Ain't quite right. Where the hell Did you get that? Right off the son Of a bitch's boot. You got it. This boy Here got it. Couple of weeks ago They stole his girl. Actually, she was One of my students. Prettiest one in The class, I'll bet. I make it a policy Not to get involved With my students. Think this'll Get us in? Could be. Ol' El Diablo does Favor his spurs. Getting in's The easy part. If you don't take the Whole damn thing In with you You just might get back Out again in one piece. What the hell you Lookin' at, boy? Nothin'. Damn right! There Ain't nothin' there. although Mr. Van Leek kept his intentions pretty much to himself it appeared the plan was to assemble some professionals to help in my endeavor. the first person selected was a Mr. Bebe Patterson who had been captured by El Diablo's men several years ago. he escaped with some useful information, but returned home minus a foot. * shall we gather At the river * * where bright angel's Feet have trod * * with its crystal Tide forever * * flowing from the Throne of god * * yes, we'll gather At the river * * the beautiful, The beautiful river * * gather with the Saints at the river * * that flows from The throne of god. * Hear the word Of the lord, O people of... Bendix. Bendix rock, For the lord Has a controversy with The inhabitants of the land. There is no faithfulness Of god in the land. There is swearing. Amen. And lying. Killing. Stealing. And committing adultery. Amen. Amen! Nothing escapes The power And the vision Of the lord. Those who have sinned Will be punished! Praise the lord. But we are here, Also, to forgive To ask the lord for mercy So that the souls of Jonathan Napier And Bob Zamudio. Roberto. So that their souls Can be saved. If you do not take The lord seriously Then he will not Take you seriously. Not only will the souls Of these poor unfortunates Be exiled for Eternity in hell But so will Yours as well! You must share With the lord The fruits of Your labors. Only then can he truly Become your savior. Hang 'em. Get on with it! Now I wanna see This collection plate Passed around once again. This time I wanna See it overflow With evidence of your Love for the lord! And I add that If I'm disappointed, There won't be any show Of justice meted Out today. But rather, these men Will be released Back into your Fold to continue Robbing and killing And having their way with Your wives and daughters With the sheep and goats And turkeys of Your flocks! Turkeys? May god bless you! Bless you! Bless you. You recognize 'em? One of 'em's Bob Zamudio. He's a pretty good Hand with explosives. That one danglin', I don't know. We could use Some help. Afternoon preacher. Let us all join in And sing the hymn, what a friend we have in jesus Whilst the good lord Determines the fate of our Brethren here. * what a friend We have in jesus * * all our sins and Praise to bear * * what a friend we have... * Equal shares All around. We're gonna need Your dead men now. I think that can Be arranged. today we went to church. It was very different from what I was used to. I had the opportunity to witness my first hanging . in fact, the gentleman who was hanged, a Mr. "pitchfork" Napier has elected to join our outfit. i'm looking forward to discussing our plans with my new companions. Who in the Hell is this Snot-nosed Little pantywaist? He's with me. Hell, he's the one That stole this! Is this all we Got to go on? His spurs are like his Fingers, like his toes. They're part Of his body. Hell, that was His daddy's spurs, And his daddy's Daddy's! "his daddy's spurs, And his daddy's daddy's." What a sorry bunch Of washed-up has-beens. Is muy valuable . Those red things are real rubies, Bob. Roberto. El Diablo's treasure Indian gold European gold Just waitin' there For us to take it. He's right about that. I seen it with My own eyes. El Diablo has Something worth A little more than Gold down there. There's a little girl-- Fuck your little girl. Just a second. You don't Wanna do that. Yes, he does. Yes, he does. Come on, boy. Come on! Come on. Come and Get it, boy. We're going to Need dynamite And someone To handle it. How about It, Bobby? I think I told you Once or twice I do not answer to That gringo name! Look, Se?or Roberto We very much Appreciate You helping us with Your special talents. Dynamite is Like a woman. It takes the Right hombre To know how to Make her explode! There's somebody Out there. I don't hear Nothin'. Injuns. Injuns? Ain't no damn Injuns around here. We're in Mexico, Asshole! The ponchachaun's, Asshole! I lived with 'Em for a year. Don't never Rob no indian. I rob an indian, Same as anybody. Yeah, did you sleep With his wife, too? What was it like sleepin' With an indian woman? Better than a nigger. Thank you, boy. Now, generally, I let A man off first time He say that To me. That is, if he Says he's sorry. How about you, Mr. Napier? Are you sorry? I don't hear you, Mr. Napier. I'm... I'm waitin'. Bye, nigger! Someone ought to Try to talk to him. Go on, Bob, You speakum sign. Roberto. I don't think Chief understands. You're full of shit, brown man. And name not chief. Name dancing bear. we added a new member to our group last night, an indian, Mr. Dancing bear who'd been tracking Mr. Napier for some time. it seems Mr. Napier had bedded down with his wife a transgression not looked on favorably by members of his particular tribe. I never liked him! once dancing bear exacted his revenge he told us El Diablo had stolen gold from his people and enslaved them. the next step was to locate a box of dynamite that Mr. Zamudio had buried. once the spot was found, I was volunteered to dig it up. What? Get out of the hole. This little Cache here Has enabled Roberto and me To open accounts At over 22 of the best banks In the southwest. You can get me Out of here now. Not fast. What's the matter? It's decayin', I think. I told you we shouldn't Bury it here, Bob. No shade, Too hot, Bob. I don't think now's the Time to make me angry. Aie, aie, aie, aie, I am Roberto. Come on, come on. It's not funny. Is good, huh? Mr. Patterson and Mr. Zamudio secured the dynamite to the buckboard. there still seemed to be some question as to its stability, however. We're a bit far apart. Maybe that might not be Good for their morale? Feel free to Join 'em, boy. I'm sure they'd Welcome the company. after riding hard the entire day, we finally crossed into Mexico. the buckboard didn't explode and I took this as a positive sign. but I was very sore and was glad when we stopped in a village for refreshments. What do you Want, boy? Lemon, whatever He's having. the cantina we selected would not have been my first choice but it was the only one in town. it hosted a different sort of clientele than what I was used to back east. Thomas, is that you? Bartender, put their Drinks on my bill. Thomas, you devil, Please come here, Join me. Thomas Van Leek, As I live and breathe? So nice to see you. Hello. Hello. Aren't you going to introduce Me to your friend? This here is Billy Ray Smith. Boy, this here is Truman Feathers Sometimes known As Kid Durango. Kid Durango? Uh-huh. Kid Durango. Kid Durango? Uh-huh. This boy has read every One of your books. Really? Kid Durango? What brings you To this hole? I'm researching Our next adventure. Smoke signals Indicated that You were headed In this direction. You know, I have a Hat just like that. I love your outfit. Where are you from? Originally Boston, Massachusetts. Really? I've been To Rhode Island. What did he mean When he said, "our next adventure?" It's a wonderful Arrangement. Thomas runs around the west, Risking his silly neck And I incorporate his exploits Into my little true stories. You mean-- What he means is, Ain't nobody gonna buy No stories about No negro cowboys. It's dramatic License, really. It's a necessary evil In the literary world. Dramatic license, hell! Whole bunch of lies. You made all that money And I never did see squat. What really gets Me is all that crap About "lookin' a Man in the eye." Hell, a man don't go for A gun with his eye. Look at his hand. I'll make a Note of it. They were with El Diablo in the bank. The unattractive One is Pestoso. That other one Ain't no lady-killer. Yes, that's Chak mol. Do you know them? They come here To unwind after Their forays of Raping and pillaging. I've interviewed Both of them. Pestoso is Surprisingly vocal. Hey, boy. How do you feel About being The fastest gun In the west? Huh? So, you're the fastest Gun in the west? Do you know to Whom this belongs? Where you Get that? Can you take Me to him? Take you to who? "take you to whom." El Diablo. El Diablo? Where you goin', Gringo? I had shot a man in a showdown in the middle of the street at high noon. actually, it was much later in the day, but it was still quite a thrill. Good shot, boy. I don't condone killing, but this Pestoso probably deserved it. if he traveled with El Diablo, he had some severe character flaws, I was sure. Good shot. You? I'll meet you In the morning Just outside Of town The tree of death. Come alone. Tree of death? Ouch! Never trust a man who Talks to his snake. It's Truman. Morning. What the hell you doin', Feathers? Well, I've decided to join Your expedition. Not with me, You ain't. You won't have to Worry about me. I'm not worried About you. I'm worried about us, With you out there. Oh, Thomas, please. I'm sure I can perform Some very useful Functions on the trail. And besides, I'm An excellent cook. Can you make coffee? As a matter of fact, I brought some fresh Columbian beans. And, by the way, I make A wonderful omelet. What is "omelet?" An omelet is diced ham, Cheese, peppers Folded into three Eggs, cooked In an iron skillet, Slightly warmed. Mushrooms, snake meat, Squash? Good? Good? I wouldn't Recommend the squash but It's entirely Up to you. For christ's sake, Let's move out! Come on. Forward! though still puzzled by the revelation that Truman was Kid Durango or not Kid Durango, I was excited that he had joined us. it afforded me the opportunity to clear up my confusion and I looked forward to one of his omelets . Now, I still Don't understand Why you're comin' Along with us. Actually, it's your Example, Billy Ray. I've always written About other People's exploits. I'd like to think that Before I pass on I could include a few Adventures of my very own. That was a wonderful Moment yesterday In the streets with You and Pestoso. It was thrilling, Virtually writes itself. You're gonna put me In one of your books? Of course. Every Story needs its hero. Hey, boy, lemme See that spur. Yes, sir. You hold onto That half, boy. That's your Calling card. Go ahead on. Be right behind You. Go on. Good luck, Billy Ray. Thank you. Goodbye. Excuse me, could You tell me precisely Why they call this The tree of death? Excuse me. I met Chak Mol as arranged and I followed him deeper into Mexico. my nerves, normally quite steady, were acting up as I sensed us getting closer and closer to El Diablo . surely, the tension would've been eased if Chak Mol had been a better conversationalist. perhaps he was shy. Thank you. Sorry. They're too split up for Us to get all at once. I think there Might just be A solution to this Problem forthcoming. We split up here. That left tunnel will let you Out above the village. Wait for my signal. Good enough? I think a little Prayer is in order Before we embark on This perilous ordeal. If you will all join me in Reciting the lord's prayer. "our father-- "our father, Who art in heaven "hallowed be thy name. "thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth" This is sorry work Party, brown man. I did the best i Could, red man. I'm here to free my people. Don't you get in my way. Wouldn't think of it. Thomas? I'd like to have A word with you. If it's short. I find your behavior in this Endeavor questionable. It's perfectly obvious to Me what you're doing. You're using this Boy as a diversion So that you can steal as Much gold as you can carry. Only dancing bear is motivated By honorable intentions. As far as I'm concerned, You're all a bunch Of mercenaries. You finished? Yes. I had to get it Off my chest. Hope you feel better. Come on, Reo. El Diablo won't touch The kid without his spur. when I arrived at el Diablo's compound, he was not in the vicinity . I decided to wait and not be impatient. I knew I was still carrying an ace in my pocket, so to speak. You are the boy who Killed Pestoso? What is your name, Little boy? William Raymond Smith. Mr. Devil, is it? I understand, Mr. William Raymond Smith You have brought Something for me. Yes, sir. This is my spur, I believe? That is correct. There is Something missing. That is also correct. Where is the Missing piece? That's for me to know And you to find out. I want to exchange it, The missing piece that Is, for the girl. What girl is that? Miss Nettie Tuleen. You kidnapped Her in front Of my school about Five weeks ago? So many towns, So many girls. She's about 5-foot-4 Blonde hair, Blue eyes Quite attractive And a very Good student. Does she Look like This girl? Yes, she does. I don't recall That outfit. Yes, she is Quite attractive. I could not believe my eyes. this was not the same Nettie who was in my classroom five weeks ago. it was El Diablo's work, I was sure. She is a very Good student. Nettie! I like my spurs Very much, Mr. Smith. They belonged To my father And his father's Father's father. I'd like to have back The piece you've stolen. Technically, It wasn't stolen. But, you see, Rosita-- Rosita? My Rosita Means more to me Than a family bauble. There's the boy. They're all over The place. Seems your plan Has taken An unexpected turn For the worse, Thomas. Spare spurs. Spoiled by Spare spurs. Try saying that Three times fast. Spoiled by spare spurs. Spoiled by spare spurs. Spoiled by spare... Shut up! Sorry, just starting to get Worried about the boy. Do you think They'll hurt him? I'm gonna hurt you if You don't shut up! Kid Durango. Always riding in back. You can ride in front On the way home. No, not the way home! Now! It's your turn. I'm not goin' in back With your Godforsaken pet. Don't call him Godforsaken. Quiet! Hello, gentlemen. I'll handle this. They're my people. Nice pants. These are Not my people. Damn it! I knew we Should've taken A right at That last fork. Throw down Your weapons. Guys, settle down. We got no quarrel With you. We're just Deliverin' supplies. Collins catering. How do you do? I would to introduce My assistants. This is Bob. Bebe. We have fine wines, Delicacies, silken robes... What's in the bag? Is nothing. You can have Anything you want In the wagon, But don't touch The bag, okay? I will decide What I want. Amigo, I would Rather die Than to give You that bag. Any other requests? gringo , the bag. Pronto. When my family came To this country They encountered Incredible intelligence And incredible savagery. The mayans built the Pyramids, charted The heavens and Gave us our calendar. But the aztecs Brought the art of human Sacrifice to a new height. Jesus! Come on! What the hell? Yeehaaa! That's me comin', You son of a bitch! Whole lot different Than writin' about it? He took Nettie. We have to catch him. Good ol' Bebe. So that's why You're here? For the gold? That's more important to You than saving the girl? The girl ain't My problem. I found a piece of the outfit Nettie was wearing next to the cave. it confirmed my suspicion that El Diablo forced her to escape with him. Nettie? Nettie! Hello, little boy. Looking for something? I want the girl. How are you going To get her back? With your Little stick? Give up the Girl, Diablo. Who is this, Little boy? My name Is Kid Durango. Kid Durango? Am I to be frightened By this name? Truman, you don't Have to do this. Yes, I do. Truman. But you are the guest, I will wait for you to Make the first move. Truman, you didn't Have to do that. Yes, I did. I did. It hurts. I'm sorry. I never thought About the pain. I assumed it would Be over quickly. Perhaps I should've Looked at his hands Not his eyes. You're ruining a Perfectly good scarf. I'm sorry. I want you to do Something for me. Anything, I'll do anything. Kill him. Kill El Diablo. Complete the story, Billy Ray. Truman, you're Not gonna die. I know. I've never Felt so alive. In whose arms are you Going to die, little boy? He didn't even Go for his gun. I was getting bored. I'm a busy man. Where would you like Me to shoot you? I will give you the choice. Where? I would not recommend The stomach. It is very painful and It takes a long time to die. But make a decision Quickly, please. You have seen, I'm an impatient man. How about you Just wing me On the shoulder Right about here. You are very funny, Little boy. I think maybe Diablo! Finally, someone who is Worthy of the challenge. Cut the bullshit, El Diablo. Make your move. You want a chaw? You wanna Try again? Damn, boy! You shot Him in the back. Well, his back Was to me. I forgot. I shot El Diablo. it may not have been a showdown in the middle of the street at high noon, but it happened . Mr. Van Leek was there to document the event. he seemed to approve of my tactics. You did good, boy. we buried the preacher, Roberto, Bebe, and Truman in the high plains. dancing bear picked the spot. he said that the ground was rich in his ancestor's blood and would nourish our compatriots' souls . There's not much To say, except I don't plan to join You no time soon. it was with great sadness that I knelt at Truman's grave. he had saved my life and there was no way I would ever be able to pay him back. he had proven to be perhaps the bravest of us all. I regret that I would never be able to really know him . Look at that. That's Billy Ray. My god! Is that Nettie Tuleen? Isn't that Billy Ray? Sure looks different. He used to wear A hat, didn't he? She's come back. Didn't think we'd See that boy again. Thank you. Comin' back, Billy Ray? Someday. Did you kill El Diablo, Billy Ray? Only god can kill The devil, charlie. That's right, Billy Ray. That's right. when I told Mr. Van Leek I was going to write an account of our adventure his ears picked up . suddenly, he was a fountain of information or should I say fabrication? he really got rolling when I mentioned I intended to pen a whole series of books. I don't want you To be writin' about No white boy with a Fancy hat and shirt. I wanna hear about The way it really is How you square off With another man. Look him right in the-- In the back? Right. Look another man right in the Back and you shoot him Before he knows What hit him.
