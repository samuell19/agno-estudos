Many years later, more or less Come Rico, we're going to bingo. Rico, come! Rico! Rico, Oskar and the Deep-shadows Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome... Miss Ellie Wandbeck! Ha! Welcome. I wish you all a good evening... With these balls, Which... Signify luck. 30. My name is Rico Doretti and I'm a specially gifted child. This means that I can think a lot, but differently. In my head there's also a bingo drum. And the balls are like my thoughts. When I have to think a lot, one of them tumbles out, And then the drum in my head is spinning like crazy. 54. Bingo. Bingo, bingo! My son has bingo! You won, Rico. - Oh, we have a winner. Come here. - Pick the purse. Sure thing. - What's your name, boy? - My name is Rico. Oh, that's Italian, huh? Doretti. And I'm a specially gifted child. So, and as the prize I'd like the purse. - When did you last see him? - I don't know. - Another child abducted? - Again Mr. 2000. - Stay calm. - Mr. 2000? The bargain-kidnapper? Mama, why do they call Mr. 2000 the "bargain-kidnapper"? Because his abductions are so cheap. First he lures kids into his car and drives off with them. Then he writes: "Dear parents, if you want Lucille-Marie back, "it will cost you 2000 euros. "Think it over, notifying the police, "or you'll get her back bit by bit." What does he mean with "bit by bit"? I don't know either. It's much too late, you should already be in bed. I'm proud of you that you've won such a nice purse. - Man, man, man. - So Rico, off to bed now. But with a song. Sure with a song, what else? Today again these eerie Deep-shadows. Buonanotte, Buonanotte amore mio Buonanotte tra il telefono e il cielo II granturco nei Campi è maturo Ed ho tanto bisogno Di te La coperta è Gelata, l'estate è finita Buonanotte, questa notte è per te - Once again. - Sorry, but I have to go. - Sleep well. - Work well. - Dream something nice, my little one. - Hm. Rico's memory-recorder See you tomorrow! Buonanotte, Buonanotte amore mio Buonanotte tra il telefono e il cielo. Reflecting. Like from chewing gum. Or rather cigarettes. Ah! - Well? - Morning, Mr. Kessler. You parked right on my treasure paper! Look, there he is again. Hey Spaghetti Spastic, don't break our camper. Well, how old is our camper, when it was built in 2011? - 2011? - Well? - I believe... - Believing means: knowing nothing. - 2011. - Ding! Time's up. I know you're parked on my treasure paper! How sweet. Did the Spastic lose his treasure paper? Morning, Rico. Morning. Maybe you can tell your husband to move it. - It's on my treasure paper. - We're on our way. Get going, boys. We're going to Croatia. Are you going somewhere too? - No... - A pity. Maybe next year. - Or you could go with us sometime, huh? - Elke, please. (Radio) Mr. 2000 is holding the city in suspense. The question is: Who's the next victim? You better run right home, before Mr. 2000 snaps you up. Man oh man. Soft. Cheese sauce. Could have fallen out. - Hello, Mr. Marrak. - Oh, sorry. Did I startle you, Agent Doretti? - My name is Rico. - I know, I know! Mama says she wouldn't want a man like you. - Who does his laundry at his girlfriend's. - She says that? - Uh-huh. - Aha. - I found a noodle. - That's fantastic. But it can't be yours. I don't know. Show me. - You never cook and that one is cooked. - Yuck. You're right. Well, you've already had something for lunch. Bon appetit, Agent Doretti. My name is Rico. Mrs. Dahling! - Rico. - Is this yours? - Where did you get it? - From downstairs. Your window is open. Could be a Rigatoni. The sauce is definitely... gorgonzola. Nice you brought it to me, but I didn't throw it out. - Try asking Fitzke. - Okay, I'll ask him. - Remember tonight. - I will. - There'll be snacks. - Yeah, snacks! Idiot is visiting, huh? - Is this yours? - Where did you get it? Sidewalk. Mrs. Dahling thinks it could be rigatoni. The sauce is definitely gorgonzola. - Was it just lying there or in something? - Who? Go buy yourself a brain, moron. The noodle. Um, now what was the question? Was your stupid noodle just lying on the sidewalk? Or in the middle of something? In dog shit maybe? No, it was just lying there like that. Show me more closely. Even more closely. Yummy. Man oh man. These will become hanging tits. In three years they'll be victims of gravity. - And then? - Then there'll be a new pair. - Or a new job. - A day job? We have to see. Gravity. "Gravel", "Gravid", "Gravity". "Gravity: If something is heavier than you, it attracts you." But not with gear but by force. The earth is heavier than us all and therefore nobody falls off. It's dangerous for apples and other round things Possibly also for breasts. Uh? Rico! - Whoa, that was close. - Sorry. Rico, I need to talk to you About that Mr. 2000. I didn't want to scare you yesterday, but... If Mr. 2000 would kidnap me, would you have the ransom? 2000 euros? Do I look like that? - Would you scrape it together? - For you? Oh, man. Even if I had to kill for it, my boy. - With ketchup? - Of course. I have to go. I'm going to the hairdresser with Irina. - Strawberry blonde, what do you think? - Is that red? No, it's blond with a reddish tinge. What does it have to do with strawberries? And what sort of tinge? - They also have a red tinge. - Strawberries are bright red. Rico, that's just how they say it. We still need lots of things for the weekend. - I would go shopping, but... - I'll do it. You're a darling. Here's the shopping list, money's in the drawer. Butter is not on the list, but there's none left. - You'll remember, right? - I will. See you later. Butter. Ransom. Ransom One, two, three. Dieffenbachstreet, Dieffenbachstreet. Dieffenbachstreet, Dieffenbachstreet, right or left? Left or right, right, left. Right or left or right? Right, left, right, left. The red cloth? The red cloth? There it is. At the red cloth near the pharmacy head towards Admiral bridge. So to the left. Right, left. Hey, young man! No cart-riding here! Ah! Strawberries with a tinge? What are you doing? I... I'm looking for something. If you tell me what, I'll help you. A noodle. What kind of noodle? Definitely a treasure noodle. A rigatoni, but only maybe. I can only tell you once I've found it. Otherwise it wouldn't be a treasure noodle. Makes sense, right? e Could it be that you're a bit stupid? - I'm a specially gifted child. - Really? I'm highly gifted. Really? I know the first 110 prime numbers by heart. - Is that why you wear a helmet? - It's for protection. What do you think? Last year, 1993 accidents caused serious head injuries. 1204 people of my age. And all that in Berlin alone. I... I need to get going. Otherwise I'll get lost. - Where do you live? - Over there. The brown house, number 93. - Really? - Why, do you know the Dieffe? No, but then you're really stupid, right? I mean, if it's right in front of you... And you just have to go straight, you can't possibly get lost. Oh, yeah? But I can! And if you're really that smart, You'd know that there are people who can. - I... - And it's not the least bit funny, That sometimes something falls out of my head. I'm not voluntarily stupid or because I didn't learn. - I... - You're one of these super brains. Who always have to brag about something because nobody cares about them, Except when they play violin on TV. - I didn't mean... - I know what's a prime number! I'm Oskar. I sincerely apologize. I shouldn't have made fun of you. That was arrogant. My name is Rico. I have to go home now. - Me too, or the butter will melt. - Huh? There was no butter because we had fish sticks with ketchup. - Okay, bye. - Bye. Don't look back now, Or he'll think I think he's cool with his funny helmet. Arrokant. Right on time. - Just look at you! - Oh. I don't feel so good, I've got such a gloomy feeling. - No, I meant on your head. - Oh, that I dyed it, so that I'm not gloomy on top as well. - Strawberry blonde? With a tinge? - Yes exactly. Why don't you come in. Go right on through. Mr. 2000 has a fifth victim. He was just released. This time from Lichtenberg. The perpetrator kidnapped a child and demanded 2,000 euros. He threatened to harm the child if the police were notified. As long as he isn't caught... Did you find out whose noodle it was? Fitzke's? - No. - Ha! Tips can be sent to the Special Investigating Unit "Mr. 2000"... Or to any police station. - I wish I had his address. - Of Ulf Brauscher? Oh yes, he's as sexy as hell. Once again the four children who were kidnapped and released. Perhaps Fitzke is the kidnapper... And hides the children in his stinky flat or in the toilet. Nope, Fitzke isn't all that bad, he just simulates. Simu... what? Enough of the sad stuff, now we'll watch a nice love story. Hm? Good night, my big boy! What a ten year old can do so as not to wake his mum: Count bags, sit in the thinking chair, Listen to the Dictaphone, sort treasures. Shoot! Where is it? Gravity. Buonanotte, Buonanotte amore mio Buonanotte tra il telefono e il cielo Tiringrazio per a vermi stupito Per a vermi Giurato Che è vero II granturco nei Campi è maturo Ed ho tanto bisogno Di te La coperta è Gelata, l'estate è finita Buonanotte, questa notte è per te Buonanotte, buonanotte fiorellino Mrs. Dahling also dyed her hair strawberry blond yesterday. Aha. Mama, do you also have the gloomy feeling? - You mean, if I feel depressed? - Huh? Depression: The gloomy feeling. A depression is when all your feelings are sitting in a wheelchair. You have no arms anymore, and there's also suddenly no one to push. And perhaps you have flat tires. Makes you very tired. I'll open it. Hello. I thought: let's introduce myself I moved in a few weeks ago on the 3rd floor. I'm Simon Westbühl. - Am I interrupting lunch? - Not at all. - Who's there? - Ostbühl. The new one from the 3rd. If it bothers you, I can come back later. Just a moment. She's using mouthwash. Very good. Sorry. Tanya Doretti. I think I'm still not awake. I wanted to finally introduce myself. I... Here, this is the nicest. For being good neighbors. Oh, that's nice. The others are for the rest of the residents. - I hope I didn't... - No. Do you want coffee? Without it I'm good for nothing. May I come in? Thank you. - Are you married? - Uh... No. - And do you have a girlfriend? - Rico. That's okay. Tomorrow we go to the Grauen Hummeln. Neighborhood bingo. I almost always win. - If you want you can join us. - Go to your room. - Please. - Isn't bingo more for grannies and gramps? Yes, but there was a vacancy, because someone recently died. - It's right next to mom and if you want... - Frederico! March! If you eavesdrop, I'll auction you off on the Internet. Man oh man. I want to hear the door slam. Ask Mrs. Dahling about the love story. I should borrow it for Mama. Otherwise she'll screw up again. In the movies they always say the right thing, And in the end they're a happy couple. Okay then, bye. - Thanks again. - Let me say goodbye... Can't you be careful? Are you blind? I rushed too fast out of the apartment. Sorry. - It wasn't your doing. - Who are you, anyway? Simon Westbühl. I just moved in. Let's be good neighbors. Oh, that's nice. - Rainer Kiessling, 2nd floor. - My pleasure. Should I pick everything up on my own, or... Sorry, I'm in a hurry. Yes, I'm also in a hurry! You see? Without a helmet I'd be dead. Oskar. What are you doing here? - What do you mean? Visiting you. - Well, Rico, you have a visitor. Come on in. - Bye. - Bye. - Since when do you wear that on a bike? - I don't have a bike. And for sure no motorcycle either. It's very dangerous without a helmet. Accidents happen all the time. But not in my kitchen. Rico can assure you of that. But the way the fish sticks flew through the apartment yesterday was quite dangerous. Today no flying fish sticks. You can stare at me as long as you want. I don't mind. But I will stare back. And I won't take off the helmet anyway. I urgently need new toenails. What do you want to glue on instead of the dolphins? I don't know, maybe other fish. - Dolphins are not fish. - She likes you. She hates me. Because I'm still wearing the helmet. Every year almost 40.000 children have an accident in Germany. One third as a car-passenger, 40% on a bike And 25% as a pedestrian. - I got an idea. Let's go eat ice-cream. - Okay. Wait here a minute, okay? - And, what do you think of him? - A bit strange with the helmet, but... Not Oskar, but Bühl. Aha. Well I would say, The guy is the hottest hunk that I've ever seen. - Then is that my... - By no means your new dad, Rico. - What are you doing today? - We're going to eat ice-cream. I'll be right back. I think the dolphins are really quite pretty. Yes? Well. Then I'll leave them on. I don't have any more. Take care of yourself, okay? Come on, Oscar. - Does your mama never hug you? - She's gone. - Took off when I was very young. - Really? And your dad? - Why is the downstairs door open? - Is it? It is! I just walked in. Without ringing. Anybody could come in: murderers, burglars, drunks, peeing in the hallway. That's so careless! Oskar, are you scared of Mr. 2000? - Nonsense. You? - Nonsense! (Song: Philipp Poisel, "Me and you") You and me and me and you We don't have a choice We just have to risk it I think we're meant to be together Are you coming? Are you coming with me? We have to go that way. Around the corner and... then another corner. And then another. Then I call it a day. Plus weekend. That's easy-peasy. We two belong together It can't be otherwise And when a dragon catches you Then I will free you Me and you Most of the cyclists get hit, because they're using the wrong lane. Most of the pedestrians, because they run across the street without looking. You and me and me and you I always look. Always! Two ice-creams, please. One in a cone. How many scoops? Many. I would like one scoop of chocolate. And one more chocolate. Another chocolate. And then another. Why don't you just tell me that you want four chocolate! But I want five times chocolate. Better first fasten the five screws in your head, kiddo. - Is that it? - Thank you. Yes thank you, or no thanks? So, can we count to five already? We can even count to seven. In a cup: strawberry, pistachio, tiramisu, vanilla, caramel, lemon, strawberry. - So, that's two times strawberry. - Yes, one at the bottom and one on top. And if possible, don't let the pistachio touch the lemon. And vanilla only if it, um... - Does it have artificial flavors? - Plenty. Good, then rather two vanilla and no, um... lemon. Otherwise, we would have eight. By the way, the vanilla plant is an orchid, you know? Workers in Reunion and Madagascar... Have to artificially pollinate them with cactus spines, Just to have enough for the world market. - Oh. - A very bad and poorly paid job. Besides, artificial vanilla is harmless. - Where was the caramel? - 5th place. But we were able to count to seven, right? Thank you. Bye. See you soon. Man oh man. Vanilla, chocolate, vanilla, but the chocolate shouldn't touch the cone. - Can we do that? - Yes. Oskar, can I see your house? And your dad? My father is almost never home, and the apartment isn't cleaned up. And when there are visitors? Hardly anyone visits. But I don't like to be home. My father doesn't like me. - And your friends? - I don't have any. Me neither. Although maybe I have one: Sophia. That's a pretty name. - Where are we going? - Fourth floor. - What's there? - Well, fourth floor. - What are we doing there? - Hush. Not so loud. - Are you afraid of heights? - What? What's the racket? I have a heart condition! - Oh, sorry. - Do you want to kill me, imbecile? Now who are you? Re-enforcements from the nuthouse? Hello? Can't you talk? Deaf and dumb, huh? Hello? I asked you something. They're smelly. In developing countries, lack of hygiene is... The most common cause of diseases. You should be grateful for soap and water! - You should make use of it. - Who are you? - Oskar. And you? - None of your business! Get lost! Before I tear your head off and use it as a soccer ball! Are you nuts? He'll make us into mincemeat if we annoy him. - The bell is broken. - It never worked. Stop! I won't be rudely treated, just because I'm a kid! You shouldn't pay attention to him. He's only musilating. - Musilating? You mean simulating. - That's what I said. - And I'm not from the loony bin! - Come on now. Come. I water the flowers here. I even get money for it. God, that's high. Over there is the entrance to the annex. Mrs. Bonhöfer blew herself up there. Blew herself up? She had lung cancer and didn't feel like going to a hospital. - She turned on the gas. - Then what? One last cigarette and... whoomp. - An explosion? - Precisely. And now there they are... These deep-shadows. - What shadows? - Deep-shadows. They are deeper. Deep in the rooms. - My God! There must be people walking about. - No, Marrak has everything locked up. - Which Marrak? - One of the men in the stairwell. The one with the letters. That's Marrak. - I see. - He has his roof garden here. Back there's the white house and the way to the annex. - And the way to the shadows. - Why did he lock everything up? - The annex is in danger of collapse. - The house is what? In danger of collapse, in case you're hard of hearing under the helmet. - In danger of collapsing. - That's what I said. - You didn't. - I did. - You didn't. - I did. - You did. - Not. - There you go. - Huh? Let's get out of here. At Fitzke's you're banging on the door, here you don't dare go next to the railing. I can swim but I wouldn't jump into a piranha tank. >�e What are piranhas? Fish with sharp teeth from the Characidae family. They shred a wounded animal or a human into little pieces in seconds. Are you actually always scared of something? It's not scared. It's caution. Pure prudence. Self-preservation instinct. - Now you're happy? - For starters it's okay. I've never been this high. - I know what makes us different. - Oh yes? You know a lot of strange things, but your mood is usually in the cellar. That's certainly true if you're very clever. For every nice thing... There occurs to you something terrible. Hm. Maybe. Are you coming back tomorrow? Actually I had plans for tomorrow. But I can do it later, I guess. Are we now real friends? Haven't we been the whole time? - At eleven? - At eleven. 21, 22, 23. 24, 25, 26. 26 steps. I only need 21 to the edge. Four, three... Two... One. Huh, Mom? Already up? - Do you know what today is? - Tell me. A day when the sun doesn't just rise outside, but also in the belly. When it makes me all warm and bright inside. Oscar picks me up at eleven. Then we'll go down the canal. Very far, because for Oskar it's a no brainer. He's highly gifted and... What's wrong with you? Do you remember Uncle Christian? That dork? What's with him? He isn't well. We have to go there. Why? What's wrong with him? Cancer. - Does he have to die? - Hmm, maybe. We should go right away. I've already packed your things. Today? But today I'm meeting Oskar. And uncle lives at the bottom left. We can't make it before eleven. That's right. You have to meet Oskar another time. Can't he blow himself up like Bonhöfer? Frederico! My brother is mortally ill, and I just want to see him alive. I don't care shit what you think! We have to go. You always say that I have no friends, and now you're ruining everything. Rico, can't you turn off your damn egotism for once? Central station, please. I'll just stare back! - Then let him come another time. - You can just leave me alone! Rico! Bloody hell! Rico! Rico! I'll call Mrs. Dahling, she'll look after you. Promise me that you'll do nothing stupid. Okay. If something happens, call me and I'll come home at once, okay? Mama? Cancer is contagious, right? No, kiddo. Cancer is not contagious. Shit.
