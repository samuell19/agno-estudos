Did you tell him? Taryn, stop. Stop! You're taking the knife? Bill, I'm leaving you the house, the car, the furniture, the swimming pool. You get everything. I'm just taking my stuff. That's right, you are the leaver. Write a song about it. I know you will. No, really. Maybe you'll be more productive when I'm gone. I'm productive. I just don't write songs anymore. I pay bills! I pay for our daughter's education. I pay for your health insurance. Well, not anymore. One new message. Message one. Hi, Kim. Hi, Bill, hi, Abby. It's Taryn, your niece and cousin. I'm about to board a bus to Baltimore and I'd love to see you. I don't really have another place to stay. I'm in Ocean City, in Maryland. Sorry for not calling sooner. Some change of plans. Hope you're home. Shit. I'll try you again from the bus station in a few hours. Is around... 2:00 all right? Fuck. End of message. Yep. Look at you all grown up. Got worried you might be on holiday. Working too hard, really. Where's Kim? On tour. But Abby's coming home tomorrow. Yeah? Yeah. You hungry? Yeah. Let's go. Need help? No? Got it? Good evening. Evening. Do you have a reservation? - No, afraid not. Let me see what I can do. Right this way. Thank you. This place is fancy. Like a funeral parlor. Good evening. May I offer a cocktail or a glass of wine? Bourbon and soda, please. Do you have a preference on bourbon? You choose. Excellent. And for you, ma'am? Wine? Yeah, go for it. Glass of red wine, please. And... two rib-eyes? Yeah, medium rare, please. Excellent, I'll be right back with your drinks. I'm so hungry. I haven't eaten anything all day. They don't feed you on the boardwalk? All we ate are chips. Yeah, you call them chips. Ate my weight in them this summer. Deep-fried biscuits, funnel cake. I'm huge. You look great. You almost look tan. Thank you. Thank you. To surprises. So Kim's on tour? Yeah. Actually, no she's not. You and Abby haven't talked for a while, huh? No. I really didn't want to be the one to break this to you, Taryn, but, uh... Kim and I are in the process of separating. She's packing up her stuff, as we speak. My God. But her new place isn't far away. We can call her first thing, and I know she's gonna want to see you. Can't believe it. I had no idea. Well, it's not something we put in the newsletter this year. I'm such an idiot. It's not your fault. I'll be right back, okay? This is a nice house. Thanks. You've got the entire third floor to yourself. Good night. Abby! I am so fucking tired. What the hell are you doing here? I missed you. I didn't even know you were in the States. Nobody tells me anything. Sorry for not calling sooner. It's been a mad summer. My dad evaporated? It's been here all morning. Welcome to my personal hell. Thanks. Good morning, sunshine. Later, Papi. Jesus, you're a terrible driver. Welcome to range life. Hello? Hey. Taryn. Hey, Abby. This is my band. This is Geoff, this is Nick. Good to meet you. - Hi. Hey, Abby. It's so good to see you, Taryn. You were in Ocean City? Yeah... believe it or not. How did that happen? Long story. Well, I wanna hear that one. Abby, how were the Hamptons? Fine. Did you stay with Mitchell's family? Yeah, they weren't around that much, though. Did you two talk? Excuse me. Who's this cat? Oh, that's Geoff's cat, be careful. She's real skittish. She looks like a bitch. You caught us at a bad time, Taryn. I shouldn't have just shown up. Oh, sweetie, that's not what I meant. You're always welcome here. Look at you, all grown up. How's your mom? You know. I do. I should call her. I've just been crazy and... I'm gonna get going. Okay, see ya later. All right, see ya. Bye. So let's just go slow, okay? All right. This is mine. But I love that one. I want it back. Abby, I made lunch. I'm not eating. Well, I made tabouli. I told you I wasn't staying. Taryn, just call me when you're done. Well, I can take Taryn home later. That would be awkward. See ya. All right, here we go, here we go. Hike. Are you okay? Hike. Yes... get it, get it, get it! Don't hurt him. Hike. Your sister's drowned, Laertes. Drowned. O, where? There is a willow grows aslant a brook that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream; there with fantastic garlands of... various flowers she fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide and, mermaid-like, awhile, they bore her up; which time she chanted snatches of old tunes, as one incapable of her own distress, or like a creature native and indued unto that element; but long it could not be, 'til that her garments, heavy with their drink, pulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay to muddy death. How do you even remember that? When he turned around and said he needed someone with smaller hands, that's when I fainted. Right there in the mud and shit, I didn't even notice. Because you were busy delivering a lamb with your small hands. Never done that before. You were a pro. You were like a cowboy. Midwife. Not usually so difficult. It was a really young ewe. The hard work is getting them matched up with their mothers, so they'll be fed, really. It was a hell of a thing for city folks to witness. Your mom cried the whole night, remember? Worried it would die. I cried all night, too. So... thanks be to you two. Taryn, you know any good Irish toasts? Northern Irish. Don't get it twisted, Dad. Here's to those that wish us well, all the rest can go to hell. Amen. What do you say, Dad? Shall we grab another bottle from the cellar? Okay, Minnow. You sound like a bunch of pirates. Fuck you. It's funny, whenever we talk about that trip, nobody ever mentions the fight Bill and Kim got into. Was I around for that? My dad stopped speaking for two days, you didn't notice? Isn't he just like that? My mom said something at Giant's Causeway and he disappeared for two hours. That's why she was crying all night, not because of the lamb. Because my mom was being a cunt? Damn, "cunt" is such a vulgar word. My God. Ah, yes, junior prom. I have to put this on right now. I wore that the year Don Dills took me to junior prom. Don Dills. Did I ever tell you about Don Dills? No. Yeah, well, Don Dills was four years older than me because my boyfriend had broke up with me the day before, so... yeah, I drank two-six of vodka to my face and then woke up the next morning with a tattoo of a devil on my ass. What? Yeah. Jesus... It wasn't real. I'm so fat. No, you aren't. Pinch... a cow. Hold it. I can't get it. Come on. There. All right. Dance with me. Turn it all the way up. As analog as it gets. As analog as it gets. - Pretty fucking cool. Hello, Jack. Voila, Papa. Nice monkey suit. Nice monkey face. Is this your girlfriend? Yep. Jack, meet Taryn. Our representative from Northern Ireland. Nice gown. Abby looked a lot nerdier when she wore that dress. Did someone invite you over? Wine? - I won't say no to the pope. Get in. I don't have my suit on. Unlike you, I don't swim in all my clothes. So take your dress off and swim in your underwear, stupid. Are you really going to date women next year? Maybe. Sam's gay, you know. I think we all knew that. He's a flight attendant. My parents try their best not to know. Helps he's never around. Well, I imagine it's a little easier for him in London than Ballymena. Unless you're into cruising the car park opposite the Auto Choice. Why don't you move to London? Or Paris? You have a dual passport and Sam. You can go anywhere. That's such an American thing to say. You can go anywhere. You're smart. I'm not smart. Gotta stow that shit, sailor. Seriously, you can do anything you want. I can't. I'm stupid. My friends are stupid. All we do is drink and fool around. That's all anybody does. We're drinking now. I'm fucked, Abby. Come on, small hands. You're not fucked. You're gonna be great. ♪ Don't wanna fuck you anymore ♪ ♪ Don't forgive ♪ ♪ Do not forget Can we try to chat my brother? Isn't it like 6:00 a.m. there? He's a party boy. He's still up if he's around. Sure. See, I told you, he's on. Taryn? Hang on, the video isn't up. Hi, Sam. How are you, love? - Hi, Sam. Who's that? Abby. Cousin Abby. Hold on, where are you? Baltimore. What the fuck are you doing in Baltimore? Do Mom and Dad know? No. Jesus fucking Christ, Taryn. What's the matter with you? What? You haven't told them where you are? No, I haven't talked to them. What happened to Wales? I didn't go to Wales, Sam. Obviously you didn't go to fucking Wales. What are you doing in Baltimore? I was working at the seashore. Now I'm visiting Bill and Abby. What about Kim? Don't ask. Hmm. Listen, I can't believe you sometimes. You gotta be responsible. Jesus, why are you yelling at me? I just called because I missed you. - I'm just worried. I don't mean to be yelling and angry, but seriously you can't just go over 3,000 miles across the world and not tell your family. It's not on. Can I talk to Abby for a second? Hi. Hi. God, it's been years, you're a proper woman. I can't believe it's the same person. Listen, do me a favor. Make her call Mom and Dad, just to let them know she's safe. Please. I'll do my best. All right. Have a great time and I'll talk to you soon, Abby, okay? - Okay. Bye, Sam. - Take care of yourself, bye. Taryn. What? I love you, sweetheart. I miss you like crazy and I want to squeeze all the air out of you next time I see you. I don't mean to be mad. Love you too, Sam. Call me again on this chat thingy, will you? We'll have a proper one. Okay. Be safe. Bye. Bye. So, Claire and George think you're in Wales? Yeah. Shit. When's the last time you talked to them? Two months ago... I don't know. You ran away? Yeah. What are you gonna do? I don't know. Come on, I'll tuck you. Harris Concrete, Bill Harris. Hi, Dad? Yeah. Where's the waffle iron? I have no idea. Maybe your mom has it? Am I on speakerphone? I'm looking for it, I can't find it. Abby... please don't call me at work for these kinds of... Hello. - Hi, where's the waffle iron? Hey, Abby. Um, I have it. Wanna make some waffles? I am making waffles... or I was. Wake up! Get up! What? You have to call your parents. What are you talking about? - I mean it, today. Why are you yelling at me? You have to tell them where you are! I don't need a fucking lecture from you, Abby! - What are you gonna do?! You can't come to New York with me. What, are you gonna live with my Dad? Make him dinner in a prom dress every night?

Yeah. Hey. Hi. Bill called. You and Abby had a fight? She got angry at me. What happened? She just came in and started yelling. I talked to your mom. She's pretty upset. You mean angry? Well... I don't know what I would do if Abby were gone for two months. I'm 19. It doesn't just turn off, Taryn. Taryn... I'm pregnant. What? I think I'm pregnant. You're late? I took a test. Oh, honey. You're drawing. Anything to exploit the pain, right? Make me one of those, Bill. What? A drink, not a picture. I can help you there. Ice? No. Thanks. So, where are we? You're having an artistic renaissance. Did you talk to your sister? Yeah. It was pretty shitty. Claire's a bitch. She's mad at me now. I could see that. They thought Taryn was in Wales. I don't know. At least they know she's not dead, right? Did you tell her about us? What did she say? I don't know. Did you talk to Abby? No. You took down the naked lady? Well, I hung it over my bed. Really? No. It's in the garage. You know, I was finally able to articulate this for myself today. You know what I don't like? What? Shaking hands... with men who come to take your instruments out of my house. It almost feels like I'm being slipped a 20. Really. Yeah, you know I think I'd probably rather just take a punch in the face than to feel that handshake again. Well, my shit's gone. There is no one coming back to take it anymore. Who is that new guy? Nick? Thanks for the drink, Bill. Stay, finish it. No. Maybe I should take Taryn. - No. Just let her lie. Just call me when Abby gets home. If she wakes me up. I gotta go. Thanks for coming. Good night, Bill. Drive safe. Fuck! My wife here? Yeah, let me get her. No, don't bother. It's no trouble, really. Kim. Maybe we should hang here a minute. Kim? Is this your room? Is this where you entertain? This is not your house to storm into, Bill. You come into my house as you please. Well, I won't anymore. Looks like I've got some catching up to do here. This is not okay. No, not much is okay. Abby's in New York because she can't stand being around you. I come home from work today and Taryn is on the curb with all of her bags packed, waiting for the next stranger to come pick her up. What? She's your sister's kid. It's time for you to deal. Okay. I'm sorry about Taryn, I'll deal with her. You talked to Abby, she's okay? - How long has it been this kid? How long have you been fucking this kid who you brought into my house last week? I am not comfortable having you here. I am not concerned about your comfort level right now. We're going to do this. We are going to have a fight right now. - Yeah. It's really all we know how to do anymore. We're fighters. Jesus, Bill. If you don't leave, I'm going to call the police. Fuck you, Kim. Get your bags. Mind if I don't walk you back up to the house? Good. Take care of yourself. Thank you for rescuing me. If you ever need rescuing. I'm going to miss having you around the house. Made it a lot less lonely. Found it. Nice. Is that you? Yeah, everyone thought I was a boy. You're too pretty to be a boy. What's that you're holding? I don't know. A dinosaur maybe. We went down to the boardwalk every summer. I know. It's like the one thing my mum liked about her childhood. Yeah, that was fun. I looked for your house when I was down there. I don't think I was in the right place. Is that my my mum? Yeah, did you know your mom raced cars? No. She looks like a punk. Yeah, she was a punk. I'm not like her. You are in some ways. Having you here makes me miss her. Cute. Your mom went to England when I was in high school. I started playing guitar... ... and then I left pretty soon after as well. I would have rather grown up with you. Yeah, tell that to Abby. If she ever talks to me again. She'll talk to you before she talks to me. I want you to call your mom tomorrow. I'm scared. She's going to be so pissed off. Trust me. She needs to hear your voice. Does it suck? Being a mother? No. It's hard, though, especially when... ... the person you'd die for doesn't want to talk to you. Are we all just fucked? I hope not. No, I don't think so. Does it get any easier? No. Promise me you'll call her tomorrow, okay? Yeah, okay. Dad? Hey, Minnow. What time is it? Late. Are you okay? I thought you were staying in New York. I changed my mind. Anyway, I didn't bring any clothes. And how was your audition? Yeah. Tired? Fucking Delaware. Taryn is at your mom's. I'm glad you're back. Come on, Rocky. Come sleep with me. Goodnight, kiddo.

Hey, great show, guys. Really great. Thanks for having us. It's always a pleasure to have you, Kim. How are you doing, do you have enough to drink? Never. Never. Well, we can get you another round, but let me warn you, the next act is up in about 20 so you're going to have to keep it moving. Okay? Okay. But thank you, really great show. - All right.

Good morning. How are you feeling? Okay. There's coffee there if you want. I just made it. Yeah, help yourself. Good morning. Morning. Morning. You sleep okay? Yeah. Cat didn't give you a hard time, climb up on top of you? That cat hates me. It's kind of her turf when nobody else is here. I think we all slept better with Golden Boy out on the porch. That was a good spot to leave him. Golden Boy? A little peace and quiet. Yeah, help yourself to anything, whatever's in the fridge. Make yourself at home. Everybody else is. Nothing happened. The fact that you even have to say that is a problem. You're overreacting. I can't... Are you kidding me? Nick, Taryn is pregnant. Taryn is pregnant? I am just letting you know. So you know what we're going through. So none of that is an option for you. There never was an option. You gotta go. I've got enough to deal with right now. Knock-knock. Hey. Hey. I found you in the '90s. On the Interweb. Think I should grow my beard back? No. It makes you look sad. ♪ Monday... Not bad, though, the music, right? I'm into it. Crazy. I'm going to take a jog. Want to get some pizza later? Golden Star? Maybe. I might go out. Feel free to start my room if you get inspired. Break a leg. Just kidding, don't. You don't have to shout, Mum. Can you put Dad on? It's dear, ya know. Calling overseas and he doesn't even want to talk to me. Fine, just don't shout, all right? I have to go. I'm hanging up. I'm sorry. I'll call you later. Bye. Hey. How was New York? I was just there for the day. Blew an audition. My mom here? In her studio, I think. So, what's new? Look, Taryn... I'm sorry I yelled at you. I don't even know why I did, I just... I wasn't even mad at you. You could have fooled me. The summer's just been really shitty, you know. I'm not trying to be their new daughter, Abby. It's not like that at all. I know. Obviously, I came at a really bad time, but I didn't know that. I didn't know where else to go. It's all right. I'm fucking pregnant, Abby. - What? I could go home. I don't want to. Oh, my God. Why didn't you tell me? I still haven't told my mum. Who's the dad? Some asshole from the beach. Who is he? Are you in touch with him? - No. He has no idea. Shit. Do my parents know? I told Kim. What are you going to do? I don't know. Fuck. I'm so scared. I'm so sorry. You didn't do it. That's a relief.
