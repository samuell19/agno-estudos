She doesn't know me, I'll teach her a lesson. Every action causes a reaction. An equal and opposite reaction. Look, when you pull the trigger The bullet comes out of the barrel. The bullet comes out, and there's a reaction. The stock reacts... and hits my shoulder. That's what's called recoil. It's not simple, is it ? It's like punishment at school: the worse the crime, the harsher the punishment. The harsher the punishment. What's the point of me practising ? I'll have hit all my targets soon. Even the ones l invented. I'll take you to the woods tomorrow, we never go out. It's not easy for me. But you're better now. You like being outdoors. You think the woods are an enchanted place. But l see them in a different way. When you walk through the trees you aren't aware of what's actually going on. The fights. The dangers. The tragedies. The strongest kill the sick or the weak. To survive. Even among birds. - What about my birds? You promised to buy lots for the aviary. They shouldn't be put in cages. They won't sing. And of course, you'd want to keep them all together. Eagles Storks Goldfinches. That won't be nice for some of them. You'd put the tortoises in there, too. l wanted to get you a pair of hunting hawks. But your mother doesn't like them. Off you go, I'm busy now. And bring me the tortoise you painted yellow. Are you hurt? It's nothing. You're bleeding, my father can help you. He's good at being a doctor. Grown-ups don't understand these things. He'd ask too many questions. Don't l? Yes, but l answer yours. l can tell you can keep a secret. Everyone knows. But... You have to swear to me. I'm not a little girl, I'll be twelve in November. l was born in November, too. No one must know you saw me. - No one. ls there anywhere l could stay for a few days? - Does it hurt? - Have you got a place? lean on me. ls it far? We'll catch him sooner, he's wounded. We can't send any back-up, they're all out. Keep an eye on the motorway junction. If he gets a lift, we'll lose him. We need hand grenades, not guns. - He must be thirty. - Violence is everywhere. l blame TV, these things shouldn't happen. l have two girls, I'm worried. I'm scared. I've seen that vehicle before, outside the school. l told the teacher, but no one took any notice. We're ready to go. Keep an eye on the volunteers. If they're restless, I'll see to them. Here they come, with the prefect's nephew. Don't let him get away. No shooting into the air this time. Get in. - 5-1 they get him in a hour. Our villa's nicer. No-one comes here, not even hunters. People say it's haunted. People are silly. Ghosts don't exist. There's not even a wild rabbit here. Come on, sit down. You're sure no one comes here? Never? - l just come here to play. With your friends ? No, l don't have any friends. My tortoises are my friends. You know tortoises die on their backs? Take their blanket. They're not cold now. - Why did you paint it? To make her stand out, she's my favourite. But my real passion are birds. In the field in front of our villa, we have an aviary. I'll fill it soon. Does that radio work? l don't know, but I've got an old toy that plays music. Who lives in your house? Anyone else? Do you get visitors? - Father doesn't want any. He's sick, he never goes out. He never sees anyone. Drink this. - What is it? - Some liqueur l found. - What's you name? - Good girl, Simona! - I'm not a good girl. See you later. Look after my tortoises... and don't worry. You're alone, but I'll be back soon. My legs are in good shape. As always. My body is important. That's right. It's my accomplice. Let's be good to it. It gets saggy... if you don't love it. They'll never learn how to make love. Idiots. They're animals. They fight over me. But they don't realise they just have my body. If l want them to. But not me. Do we have to stop here? We're wasting time. The police always wastes time. l didn't call you. l don't need any volunteers, you may as well go. Why don't we get him? Who'll stop us, this lot? But we have to pay a visit to the lady. Let him go where he wants. l don't care. l just want that swine. Let's hope she comes too, it'll be fun. We'll wait here for him. My husband can't see you. He never goes out, he sees no one. It's like he doesn't exist. You want to investigate? My husband can't see you. I'm worried about you, madam. I'm flattered you care, lieutenant. l know you've always liked me. Another girl's missing. The same vehicle again. We almost had him, but he got away. If l see him What should l do ? Carry on joking. I'm responsible for you and the others. Let me handle my responsibilities. I've had them since l was a child. It's my duty to tell you, if you want one of my men just say so. After all, you're alone. Because l want to be. And perhaps because l have no choice. We're not good enough? Or don't you trust us? l don't care what you all think. Look, you too may need someone. Please, stop talking nonsense. You can go. Did she strip for you? Stop talking nonsense, the lady is very worried and wants to help us. That beast killed four girls. She has a girl the same age. No one saw anything. Let's head north. - Aren't we searching the park? They'd have seen him here. He could be hiding by the swamp. No one goes there, not even the hunters. Let's search there, then. l decide these things. l want to kill that swine. He won't get away. Let's go. Come here. Where were you ? - In the park. Did you see an injured man near the swamp? l didn't see anyone. Listen... If you see him stay away from him. And call me. Sit down. What did those men want? You saw them? Nice, isn't it? They told me to be careful, but of what? What do l have to be careful of? l don't know. Ask your mother. What heals a wound? You put penicillin on it, why? l found a wounded bird in the park. Will Giuseppe bring my birds soon? l can never find you. Go, l have to speak to your father. - Can l stay ? l told you to go. You like being unpleasant. She's your daughter. - She's not involved. You know why I've come. Or are you losing your memory because of your illness? The deadlines. You have to stick to them. I've always stuck to our deal. Ever since we came here. You said for a while. But now you're blackmailing me to stay. You want my money? Come and get it. - Listen to you. A dying man's terrible vendetta. Even in this state the master gives orders. Don't you ever get tired? Just think, one blow And you'd be gone. I'd be rich and free. You'd be eaten by maggots. Having an enemy like you gives me a good reason to live. l need your signature. You have to say please. You don't want to give up, do you? That scooter will stop. Don't be in such a hurry, dear. You'll have to stop something else first. One two, buckle my shoe. Three four, knock at the door. Five six, pick up sticks. Seven, eight, lay them straight... Close the door. l didn't think you'd come. Where have you been? - Why are they after you? You saw them? Yes, some men with guns. Did they talk to you? They've gone now. And anyway, l don't care. I do. I'm in trouble. They'll come back for me. And l can't go anywhere. They'll kill me if they find me. l brought you some food. l don't want anything from you. If they come here it's your fault. You acted as bait. They want to kill me. And you'll lead them here. You're just like the others. I shouldn't have trusted you. Don't cry. I'm sorry, Simona. You've helped me. l should be grateful. But I'm scared. Here's your client. - I'll never get used to this. - It's not nice. She died about 24 hours ago. - She hadn't eaten. - How was she killed? She was strangled, like the others. She struggled, the bruising shows that. Look at her chest. She was raped. - Of course. What else is there? - Soap and sand in her hair. He was more brutal this time. Her windpipe is severed. He was in a hurry or scared. Anything else? - It's the same man. Did the prefect put up a reward? - There'll be a man hunt. - Come on, Sorrentino. ls this all right? It's perfect. It's pointed and sharp. What's it for? To feel less pain. Don't look, turn away. Close your eyes. Don't turn around. You can look now. l need surgical spirit and bandages. Get me some. All l found was this cloth. Pour some spirit onto the wound. I'll do it, give it here. Give me the cloth. This is all l found. It's filthy. What are you doing? They're clean. Cut them with the knife. Let go of me. - Wait. When will l see you? You won't be seeing me again. Mother and daughter are both creaping back in. Like two thieves. Don't you like your bed anymore? l know. You've grown-up. l started young too. Now you can understand me. My head. Come next to me. Do what I showed you last time. l looked so nice tonight. And that filthy... That feels good. You don't like me anymore, do you ? Listen... Tell me a secret or two. Same as always. You don't want me as a friend. l hate making friends with children. There's nothing l like about children. They're ruthless. They grow up, then get rid of you. To think that a while ago You used to hold them. They laughed, played and touched your breasts. Tell me... Do you... masturbate? Come on... You can tell me. It's a nice thing. Here he is. He never goes out, but he's everywhere. He's always around. He's a nightmare. He's always there. I can't stand it. We make a great trio. A really great trio. A rich snob, a paralytic old man... And what are you ? Where are you going? l don't know what you are. This is the first time I've talked to you like this. And you don't give a damn. Isn't that right? I'm not a bad person but you always judge me. With your cold eyes. I'm just afraid. I've given you nothing. I don't know how to give. But I've never cheated you. I never pretended to be your mother. That's good, isn't it ? You and me are equal. You want to know something? It all ended for me when your father became ill. I used to do lots of things. I've changed now. You pretend you can't remember. I really tried to love you. Find any money? Just rubbish. Let's take him with us tomorrow. - With his broom. You forgot your bandages. What did you buy? What are the bandages for? ls someone at home hurt? Answer me. - How did you get here? On my scooter. - By yourself? Let me see what's in there. But we're your friends. Do you know the lieutenant? He said he has a note to give to your mother. We can go there together if you like. What about my scooter ? - We'll pick it up later. Are these medicines for your father? Look at this man, tell me if you know him. You know him? Are you sure? Take a good look and don't lie. Lieutenant, we're wasting time. Let me try. - No, I'll do it. Think about it, Simona. Perhaps in the woods near your house. I'm looking for him because l want to help him. If the others find him they'll kill him. l don't know him. Look. Do you like it? Look, she was strangled and she won't be the last. That swine will do the same to you. Be honest, you were taking him some medicine. Tell me or I'll throw you in the well. That's enough. Get out. Where do you think you are? You get out too. I've asked for a transfer... What ks the matter with you? That monster could kill our children. We have to stop him. Right, and to do that you'd torture that girl, wouldn't you? I don't care who protects you. Get lost or I'll lock you up. Will you? You can't stop me. People trust me more than the law now. Simona, why are you with the lieutenant? She's always by herself. you stink like the police, even from far off. I don't like that smell. - Get used to it. I have some questions for you. Just answer them, instead of talking nonsense. This is an important matter. Who told you to sit down? As you're being so nice, I'll have a drink too while on duty. This is my house, you're not drinking. I'll drink and I'll stay. You can't do anything about it. Get out. I'll pretend l didn't see that. These tricks can get you into trouble. And they don't work with me. Your husband needs bandages? Why? Because Simona may have seen something or someone. Or worse, she's hiding him. She's no ordinary girl. We questioned her. - You're mad. I need your permission to search the park. What if I refused? I'd be irritated. And so would my men out there. What's this search for? You think Simona's hiding someone? I'm not sure. Young man, you're never sure of anything. And I've never liked people who don't feel sure about things. Something could happen to Simona. It'd be your fault. This one works too. Let's put them all over. - There are no animals here. A nosey-Parker might come. Come on. This one can go here. Come and help me. We'll put the last one there. This place is huge. Sit down. Why do they call you the ''beast''? Sometimes l feel like doing something. So l do it, l don't know how. It's just that someone always tries to stop me. People say I'm confused. But so are they. l really don't understand people. I'm not like the others. If you want something, ask me. As soon as we can we'll run away. Put your foot there. l don't know where we'll go, and l don't care. When we get somewhere, we'll stay till we like it. Then we'll move on and keep changing places. It doesn't matter where. Like husband and wife? I like travelling around. Will you come with me? Hide. Come here, I want to talk to you. It's important. Where were you? I bet you were in the hunting lodge. You know it's dangerous. It's full of broken glass. l think your birds have arrived. l saw Giuseppe coming in a truck. Aren't you happy? You moaned about your cage being empty. Can we go? You go, l want to have a look round. I've seen some traps, I don't want any shooting near here. Go, I'll join you later. ls anyone here? Who is it? Come out. l said come out. Don't move or I'll kill you. You're the man they're looking for. I'm not scared of you. Close the door. l liked it. Because you did it with hate. So you're not scared of women. Or... you want protection. I can give you that. But it might not be worth my while. I think love... is all right when it's worth it. I don't have any expectations. It always ends here for me. And now Let's talk business. Business? You're wanted. The police are after you. It's risky for me to hide you here. What will you give me? I'm innocent, l didn't kill anyone. l don't care, I'm not questioning you. I've got a proposal for you. You need money to escape, lots of it. l want to leave too. I'm tired. I've had enough. My husband's rich. Very rich. He's loaded. And he's very sick. But not sick enough. It's simple, you see? It won't take much. We'd be doing him a favour... Him... Me... And you. No one will find you here. You're safe. For the first time. You can speak up, we're isolated. Here. I'll sleep here tonight. Why? Is it part of our deal ? I just want to sleep with you. Since I came to this house... I've not slept with a man. I'm always alone. I'd rather be alone. I've got no protection. Anything could happen to me, someone might even kill me. Really ? You poor thing. But you're not scared when you kill young girls. I don't want to kill them. They ask me to do it. Because they want to... They want to be young girl's forever. That's a great excuse. But tell me... why do you rape them then? Women don't make me feel manly. I understand... I can be sweet, and very understanding. Look at her. She's a proper little madam. Her mother's the one to blame. See you tonight. You look nice, sweetie. Say hello to your mother. He wants different bullets. I'll get them for you. Here we are, one of these will blow a man to pieces. Put them on his bill, please. Did you find that man ? Not yet, but he'll get caught sooner or later. Here's a little something for you. You like it? That's all your men managed to do. A scratch on his arm. We'd have brought you that bastard, wrapped in newspaper. Where did you find it ? Near that lady's villa. When l get a hunch I'm never wrong. Sorrentino, send this to forensics. - And l want the results quickly. Shall l inform the prefect? Forensics won't solve anything ! They're a waste of time. What's wrong, you want to get your money? Who are you after this time ? I need your permission to carry out a search. You want to search my bedroom too? Just the park, for now. - I'll come with you. Get inside. - How are you, Simona? - Hurry, let's not waste time. Are you scared of me? Aren't we friends? How come you're here? I spent the night here. Vera told me... - It's safer. - l know where she hid you. But she'll want something in return. You're so pretty. - Well, what are you waiting for? You're scared of Vera? l want to have a baby. My own baby. He won't be like them. Let's hope they get off my back. They'll bother someone else now. l liked the way you treated them. If l had to, I'd do the same with you. Why are you so hostile? When I was a suspect, you said nothing. I believe in facts, not gossip. Me, too, and I've heard enough. They've gone. Come out, no one's here. Stay where you are. Be quiet, don't move. What now? - There's no point ringing. That bitch won't open up. We'll have to open the door ourselves. Where's the lieutenant? - He went off by himself. They're breaking the door down. They want me. You understand now? They'd have got me out there. If they come in, I'll cut your throat. They won't come in if I'm here. Hide behind the curtain. Let's set the house on fire. What about the girl? She's a whore just like her mother. Let's not waste time. Smash the glass. There she is. - Whore. Let's hear her out. Don't let her charm you. What do you want ? I've had enough for today. Get away from here. Go. That won't work with me. Where's the lieutenant? He'll be looking under the stones. In these cases we're better off without the law. Get out. - If you've nothing to hide... why are you so upset? Don't make her angry or her husband will beat us up. You dirty swines. - That's enough. l told you to go. Get out. - Shut up. You go outside, you two go up with Angelo. And you go in there. - Come on. Who is it? - Open the door. l can't, I'm naked. - Open up. I'm having a bath. Don't move. What's going on? - Her husband's mad. He shot at me, we'd better go. Happy now? You got yourself into a right mess. You win this time, but keep quiet. Or I'll have to cut your throat. l scared you, I'm sorry. Should l thank you? l didn't do it for you. As usual you missed the target. But I'll get you, don't worry. You don't have the guts to shoot me. This will pierce your heart, it's silver. That's how they kill witches. You're dying. Not yet. My time's not come yet. You're wrong. It's closer than you think. And I'll enjoy watching you die. Go on then. Here. Let's see what you can do. Come on, shoot. Isn't this what you wanted? You think I care? l gave up on life ages ago. That's why I hate you. No, you hate yourself. Because you don't know how to live your life. You want me to believe that? I'm not like you, I'm free. - You're not free. I'm free, do you understand? You're not free. You never will be. I'm sorry, l can't wait any longer. There's no point. Because, you see. I'm doing it for my future. There's no way out now. And l have to go the whole way. When? Very soon. - Have you persuaded him? No one must know about what we did. It's a secret, alright? What are you doing? Don't wander around the house. You know how risky this is for me? What's wrong with you? Why didn't you tell me he was here? You shut up. They almost caught you this time. Get back downstairs. Don't try my patience. It might run out. That'd be the end of you. Look at the mess you've made. You've learnt how to use make-up by spying on me. Not very well though. Go wash your face, immediately. What were you two doing? You have to do as l say, always. l know what l have to do. You're just evil. Father's right not to love you anymore. We made a deal, did you forget? What if l said no? I'd turn you in. What about love? Love's not the answer to everything. We're in this together. If they catch me they'll get you too. l don't want to kill an old man. And l don't want to hurt Simona. l care about her. Forget about her. She'd end up alone. That doesn't concern you. My muscles are getting stiffer. My heart just does what it wants. That's not true, you were fine yesterday. I've reached the end of the road. In that moment I'll be alone. Like elephants. They leave their herd and go to die in their graveyard. l used to do the same when something bad happened. I'd look at the clouds trying to see a face or a flower. Then I'd be up there with them. But it's wrong. You have to be... Aware? - Yes, that's the word. l don't play with clouds anymore and l don't cry. Maybe that's right for you. You're young. You're starting to bloom. But I'm old. It's quite easy to give up. You agree then? You know what you have to do? Remember that children's game? You draw a square... And you hop on it. If you go out, you've lost. And you have to start again. How many times have you done that? Started what? Living. It's always been the same for me. Following. Or being followed. Always at war with myself. What counts is the result. You must never give up, never let anyway get in your way. What's the matter? You spent all day with her. That's not important. Simona, I've been thinking about you. You're like me. Meaning? If you don't smile, I'm sad. That's better, good girl. That's it. l hope she goes out as usual. You know how many birds there are? Those that live in small places... Those who travel short distances for food. And those that head for the sun in the winter. Which ones do you like? The ones who travel far. They're the bravest. I want to leave this place. I have to find a way. I'll help you. I got a gun for you. I don't need it. Hide it, let's see what the others do first. Then we'll decide. That's rubbish. Mother's keeping you here, so are all the others. Except me. You'll stay as long as she wants. Until she decides. Until you go mad. I've got an idea for your mother... Don't worry, we'll leave soon. Get up. Go sleep in your room. You don't sleep in yours. What does that mean? I watched you. Good girl. Now go to your room. Did you hear me ? Go on. There's no need to shout. I'd slap you... but you'd play the victim. l won't give you the satisfaction. You fell for it. I thought you were frigid. Why are you like this? Is it my fault? Or your father's? Or yours? Is it this damn house? Or are you just a dirty little spy? Have you ever been discreet? That's not important. You'd still be the same. That's what you're like. Poor little Simona. You're learning but you don't understand. And so quickly. In the car, the doctor called you ''whore'' and you answered yes to him. I've always said yes. I've always had to say yes to everyone. Everyone. Even to your father. And you know why? To pay for this horrid life. And the illusion of freedom. I paid for it in flesh, without complaining. I've always paid for everything. In full and at a high price. l don't care about your freedom. It's too late, mother. You're old. You hang on to things because you want them, not out of love. Good girl. Good little darling. If you know all this... You have to know that you... with your tortoises and your damn birds... are no better than me. And you're no different either. We're very different, l won't let you take Federico away. - You won't take him from me. - Come here, please. He likes young girls. - What are you saying? l went with him. Are we going then? You promised me. Promised what? - That you'd fix the aviary. l didn't promise, but... Where's the toolbox? - In the kitchen. Don't worry about that now. We have other things to do. Sit down. l need some fresh air. If he doesn't go out, he'll end up like father. You go out. Go where you like. We interrupt our programme for a news bulletin. No news on Federico Anselmi, the dangerous criminal accused of horrific murders. Turn the radio off. The funeral of his victim, the young Stefania Conti, was held today. Many mourners were present along with the local authorities. You have to do as l say. Get out. Do you want to kill her too? You'd treat her better? l know her. l know her well. She's a sly little rattlesnake. She can't help it, that's what she's like. She hovers around you... She circles round you till she bewitches you with her charm. When you're least expecting it, she poisons you. She's got plenty of poison. Enough for us all. She's not forgiving. That's her strength. Perhaps you're right. She's spying on us. You're trying my patience. - Calm down. Take it easy, just till tonight. Then it'll all be over. Killing a man... or a child... is the same thing. What difference does it make? What are you saying? You're insane. Or a dog. Or a fly. Where's the difference? We're all a bunch of crazy flies. He's only half a man. He knows that. He wants to die. But he wants me to do it. Because... he's scared. So that's it. We'll do as l say, end of story. I'm going mad. I'm leaving. Run along now. I've told you everything, I'm counting on you. I'll talk to your mother. You want to talk? We'd better go inside. - I'm fine here. I've already told you l don't care what's better for you. I worry about myself, l can do without your presence. And that of Federico Anselmi, the criminal, the madman? Doesn't that bother you? l don't know what you're talking about. Your insinuations are nonsense. There is something bothering me. It's you. ls that all you can say? l thought you were smarter. You know what people will say? Not to mention the years in prison you'll get for being an accomplice to murder and the rest. What proof do you have? Nice way to end up for a rich and respectable lady, isn't it? You're blackmailing me? - Aren't you surprised? That I'm here alone. I represent the law. Aren't you wondering why I'm alone? Without a search warrant or my team of men? We can find a solution. A lady like you... I'm sure you understand. I'm sure we can make an agreement. For the right price. You're right. Let's talk inside. Where is he? First, we make a deal. He won't get out. You whore, open up! You sold me, open up! What'll we do now? l have to come with you, to protect you. You can't go by yourself. l have to stay with you. You're still a young girl. I'll get dressed and we'll go. The time has come for us to go. Beyond the park, where the grass changes colour. Where the roads begin, the big ones. We'll follow them, they all lead to the city. That's where they are. - Who? Those my age. It's nice starting over. Everything feels easy today. Within reach. l can work, l can do anything. I'm strong, we don't need much. In the south of the city l know a place where all the brick houses look the same. It'll be fine for us. And there's a railway nearby too. If we don't like it, we can go elsewhere. But I'm sure no one will bother us this time. We just have to be careful. And not talk to them. You have to stay close to me, always. Always, you got that ? I only trust girls. - Stop calling me a girl. As you like. This cage. - What about it? I want to destroy it. You want to scare me ? I can get out of here, too. You want to see? Look. Watch me climb. It's easy, you see? l can go higher. The sky's so near... l want to touch it. You're getting smaller. There, l can fly now.
