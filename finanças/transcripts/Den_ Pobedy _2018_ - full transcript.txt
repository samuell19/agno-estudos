The scythe of war cut us to pieces, But now the war is no more. Four years mother mourns her child, Four years mother mourns her child, Four years mother mourns her child. Pick up your coat, let’s go home. Our streets have burnt to ashes, Again, again, my dear friend. But look – the starlings are returning, But look – the starlings are returning, But look – the starlings are returning. Pick up your coat, let’s go home. Your eyes’re now shut forever. You sleep beneath a plywood star. Wake up, wake up, my dear comrade, Wake up, wake up, my dear comrade, Wake up, wake up, my dear comrade. Pick up your coat, let’s go home. What shall I say to your old folks, How can I face your widow’s eyes... No use in yesteryear glory, VICTORY DAY No use in yesteryear glory. Pick up your coat, let’s go home. Yeah, that's right! It took you a long time. Sasha, stay! We'll take one. - For a small donation. Want a pin? - Yes, please. We're German. - I looked for so long. Why are we German? I don't know what I am. Pins’re over here. I am Russian and German. Dad's looking for him. Twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen. Our daughter asked us again. No idea. Our daughter asked us again. She's with that Xavier Naidoo... And I say what nonsense? What nonsense? And we said at 4pm... For you my darling, a letter from the army post. Farewell! Trumpets call! Forward, soldiers! Soldiers March, March, March! For you my darling, a letter from the army post. Farewell! Trumpets call! Forward, soldiers! Soldiers march, march, march! For you my darling, a letter from the army post. Let's go, everyone over here. This song is for Leonid of the Baltic Sea Fleet. Very nice! Tomorrow... Alexander! May we steal Comrade Officer from you? Friends, let us sing, for tomorrow we set off to the sea. We’ll drift into the morning mist. We’ll sing our merry song, and with us will sing along our grey-haired Old Captain. Farewell my beloved city, for tomorrow we set off to the sea. At dawn I’ll catch a glimpse of my darling’s blue scarf waving to me from the shore. Today is 9 May 2017. And... It’s obvious here in Germany and in Europe, and in particular in Russia, it’s obvious that WWII is not over. Peace treaties between as may as 54 nations are violated. It’s obvious that the Third Reich never surrendered. One points to the surrender of then Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and Karl Dönitz. But only military forces surrendered. It’s obvious that Germany still has no sovereignty, It’s still a nation under occupation. It's obvious the Russians were lied to as well as the entire international community, by the fascists. It’s obvious that fascism can reinvent itself in the new economy. It’s obvious that no reconciliation ever happened... gone! It’s obvious that a strong opposition exists in Germany, it’is our organization! It’s obvious that this opposition in Germany today is confronted by armed forces. It’s obvious that in Germany opposition activists get locked away. It’s obvious that in Germany human rights are not respected. It’s obvious that in Germany open dictatorship reigns disguised as a party democracy that isn't in truth. This is all obvious! Pear trees and apple trees are blooming Gentle mist is set above the river Katyusha goes to the river, To the high, steep riverbank, Katyusha goes to the river... You can do anything to Nazis, punch them in the face, they don't care. A Nazi loves a black eye. But what you should never do, never make fun of Nazis. They don't like it at all. That's exactly what you asked. Victory Day! Happy Victory Day, guys! Hold that rifle tight! Hello, happy Victory Day to you! I come from the Urals. I'm from Kazakhstan. I'm from Siberia. Have you left your men behind? Why have you stopped moving? Let's go and stand on the steps. Get in close together. My phone is ringing. We need this victory, One for all, no matter the cost. One for all, no matter the cost. Deadly fire awaits us, And yet we’re not scared. Do not fear! Out we go into the night, our Tenth Infantry battalion. Our Tenth Infantry Battalion. From Kursk to Oryol, the war has brought us Straight to the enemy’s gates, so it goes, brother! Someday we will remember this And not believe it ourselves. But now all we need is victory, One for all, no matter the cost. One for all, no matter the cost. Deadly fire awaits us, And yet, we’re not scared. Do not fear! Out we go into the night, our Tenth Infantry battalion. Our Tenth Infantry battalion. Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Now get out the photos of the veterans. I'm not reading this letter, it's long, and I cannot recite so well. It's very hard. I will only read two letters, from two special people. Honorary citizens of Donetsk and Lugansk Republics. Trofimenko Vassili Alexandrovitch, he fought all the way to Berlin, he left his signature on Reichstag wall: "Happy to see the ruins of Reichstag” And Kuznetsov Vladimir Ivanovitch from Stalingrad, who celebrated victory in Vienna, he wishes to share these words with all veterans: "I wish you luck, happiness and health, and do not forget that we all defended the USSR and the Soviet land. We, all together. We brought freedom to Europe." And I would like to add that Victory Day, for all peoples of the world, has a sacred significance. It’s a sacrifice, like Calvary, to which the Soviet soldier arose, to this cross, and thus lighted a new way by which we could remain human. And we pushed off the brown plague to the periphery of our civilization I want to show you the altar light that our veterans from Donetsk give to us. Wonderful. Do we have carnations? Now we proceed to Grave 25 to observe a minute of silence. It is a tradition. Every year we bring some soil here, a little bit of our soil. Soil from the place where the catastrophe began for every Russian. The soil comes from the Brest Fortress, a place of unmatched bravery and unparalleled honor of the people. Everyone there fought. Russians, Ukrainians, Novorossiyans, Chetchens, Ingushes, side by side. Hardly ever asked was the question where do you come from or what religion you have. Because we only had one goal. There was only one goal. And with small steps in spite of heavy losses, we inched closer to it every day for 4 long years. I wish one of these veterans had spoken. But if not... Look around. Any veterans here? Veterans of the Great Patriotic War? Do we have one? Have him come up here! May I say a few words? – I’m sorry, folks. My mother came for the first time today. She spent 4 years in a camp in Frankfurt. Germans saved her. And this is my grandfather. He saved a German girl in Poltava. He hid her under his coat and she survived. And this is the father of our daughter-in-law. He died here. He was in the war. He was in Berlin. They came here today for the first time. We took pictures. Thanks for the memory. You said it right: It doesn't matter whether one is Russian, Ukrainian or German. My father always said, "There are real men, and there are scum." And to the warrior far away give him Katyusha's love. I propose and think the club will agree to give this soil to the mother. We give you this soil so that you may give it to your mother. Thank you to everyone. Take care! We're the "Night Wolves", a Russian biker’s club. Participants of the rally "Roads of Victory". I congratulate everyone It’s the Great Victory Day! As a sign of celebration let's have a Russian hurrah! Two times short, one time long: Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Only three of us were left alive out of eighteen comrades. So many of us, will rest forever In a foreign village, at a nameless height. In a foreign village, at a nameless height. Could you congratulate all the Kazakhs and all the veterans? Kazakhs, we congratulate you on this Victory Day, we wish you luck, health and blue skies above your heads. Love one another, love this life and all will be good with you. We love you. Kazakhstan, have a great Victory Day! To the 9th of May, day of Victory! - Hurrah! My name is Petrukhin Dmitri and I brought the flag of Kazakhstan from Almaty. I drove ten thousand km, to bring my grandfather, a Kazakh hero, Kachkyrbayev Rakhimjan, to this tomb. I am so happy I’ve done it. Congratulations to all! Hurrah! For you my darling, a letter from the army post. For you my darling, a letter from the army post. Farewell! Trumpets call! Forward, soldiers! Green maple, curly leaves, Green maple, curly leaves. Green maple, curly leaves, All curly and so fine, I greet you sweetheart, kind one, gentle one. Green maple, curly maple, All curly and so fine. Green maple, curly maple, All curly and so fine. Cossacks, Cossacks, They are riding through Berlin, our Cossacks. Cossacks, Cossacks, They are riding through Berlin, our Cossacks. He would like to stay but he gets the evil eye, "Giddy up, my horse!", he calls in gallop. The cavalry rides past, a pretty girl. A gentle, tempting glance she threw at the Cossack. Cossacks, Cossacks, They are riding through Berlin, our Cossacks. Along the Berlin cobbles The cavalry captain rides. And sings of his love for the girl: "It is far from the Quiet Don, It is far from my cozy home, Yet the Cossack and his sweetheart meet in Berlin." Cossacks, Cossacks, Oh, the green pines rustle not above me, la, la, la, la... Kalinka, Kalinka, my Kalinka. In the garden is the raspberry, my raspberry. Kalinka, Kalinka, my Kalinka, In the garden is the raspberry, my raspberry. Come on! Come on! Bravo! Everyone fought in the war. Everyone should celebrate! We are here to honor the soldiers and commanders of the Red Army, who fell in the Battle of Berlin and are buried in Treptower Park. First lieutenant Ovotchayev Afanasy Ivanovich, Irkutsk region.

He’s assigned to go westward, She’s to go far away, Komsomol members’re leaving to the Civil War front. Komsomol members’re leaving to the Civil War front. They said good-bye to one another, left behind their homeland, You, my dearly beloved, make a wish as farewell. You, my dearly beloved, make a wish as farewell. And the girl says to her comrade: "Oh, I wish with all my heart! Let your death be a painless one, Let your wound be very light. Let your death be a painless one, Let your wound be very light. And another wish I have my beloved comrade, wish that you return victorious back to me, back to your home. Wish that you return victorious back to me, back to your home." He’s assigned to go westward, She’s to go far away, Komsomol members’re leaving to the Civil War front. Komsomol members’re leaving to the Civil War front. Pear trees and apple trees are blooming, gentle mist is set above the river. Katyusha goes to the river, To the high, steep riverbank, Katyusha goes to the river, to the high, steep riverbank. Oh song, pretty girl’s song, fly after the bright sun, reach the soldier far away from home bring Katyusha’s love to his heart. Let him think of his beloved maiden, Let him listen to her pretty song, He shall guard the borders of the country, and Katyusha guards her love for him. He shall guard the borders of the country, and Katyusha guards her love for him. Pear trees and apple trees are blooming, gentle mist is set above the river. Katyusha goes to the river, to the high, steep riverbank, Katyusha goes to the river, to the high, steep riverbank, to valleys embraced by the silence He cannot step down from his hill, He doesn’t bring flowers to girls, to girls, to girls, He doesn’t bring flowers to girls, And they do bring flowers to him. When fresh snow sets in the fields, fresh snow, fresh snow, When fresh snow sets in the fields, and when it’s pouring down with rain, Alyosha remains on his pedestal, Alyosha, Alyosha. Alyosha remains on his pedestal, a Russian Soldier in Bulgaria. Alyosha remains on his pedestal, Alyosha, Alyosha. Alyosha remains on his pedestal, a Russian Soldier in Bulgaria. Across the mountains, across the steppe our division swiftly moved, to capture Primorye region, the bastion of White army. Fucking nonsense: One has lots of money and goes mad. One has no money, and still goes mad. It’s not about money, fuck it! It’s about morality. Morality is the Russian way. We’ve always had it in Russia. Spiritual, genuine, Slavic morality. Don’t’ you fucking get it – the value of life, of respect for God, for people and for fucking life. Have a look around: My God, who stuffed your dumb brain so full of shit! I know red carnations are hard to come by. I looked for them today and couldn't get any. The Germans are also buying lots of red carnations. Call when you get there. See you later, Igor. To Victory Day, comrades! Hurrah! To Victory Day! Dark is the night, only bullets Are whistling through steppe. Only wind’s blowing through power lines, Only bright stars are twinkling. Dark is the night, and my darling Is staying awake, Shedding secret tears, Rocking our baby’s cradle. Oh, how much I do love your deep, gentle eyes, How much I do long to press my lips to them now. Dark is the night. It’s the night that keeps us apart... “MAY THE VICTORIOUS BANNER OF GREAT LENIN SHINE UPON YOU!” I.STALIN A Sunday shall come, A Sunday shall come when we will celebrate our marriage. A Sunday shall come when we will celebrate our marriage. Where will you take me? Where will you take me, if you have no home? Where will you take me if you have no home? I will take you to a stranger’s house, I will take you to a stranger’s house, I will take you to a stranger’s house, Stranger’s, stranger’s, while I build my own house, my own, my own. I will take you to a stranger’s house, Stranger’s, stranger’s, while I build my own house, my own, my own. Build a house, build a house of hay. Build a house of hay, but I shan’t go to a stranger’s house. Build a house of hay, but I shan’t go to a stranger’s house. You betrayed me, you deceived me. You're driving me, a young man, mad. You said on Tuesday you'll kiss me forty times. I came, you were not there. You betrayed me, you deceived me. You're driving me, a young man, mad. You said on Wednesday we'll pick dandelions. I came, but you were not there. You betrayed me, you deceived me. You're driving me, a young man, mad. You betrayed me, you deceived me. You're driving me, a young man, mad. Make sure you get the full height! Make it look pretty. Friendship! Hurrah! Germany, Ukraine, Russia are together, only together! In general, about the role of the communists and the communist resistance... Dachau was the first concentration camp on German soil. The prisoners were communists or suspected of being communist sympathizers. 10000 revolutionaries, workers fighting for the class struggle, all murdered. The bourgeois politicians are absolutely aware that the victory over Hitler's fascism, without the decisive participation of the former Soviet Union and the Red Army, would not have been possible. Nevertheless, just afterwards came a wave of anti-communism. Especially against Stalin himself. Its pinnacle was the absurd image of a brown-red complacency, where Hitler and Stalin, as the worst enemies of democracy, were given equal stature. I want to state clearly here: The present day Treptower Memorial is not only a cemetery for the seven thousand soldiers killed in the Battle of Berlin... Come over! - Don't be shy, there's plenty here! Sometimes it seems to me that the soldiers who will not return from battlefield, soaked in their blood. Weren’t laid to rest in Russian soil But turned into a flock of white cranes. And ever since that moment, long gone moment they fly above and call out for us in the sky Isn’t that why we so often go all quiet looking at the skies. Sometimes it seems to me that the soldiers who will not return from battlefield, soaked in their blood. Weren’t laid to rest in Russian soil But turned into a flock of white cranes. Ukraine and Crimea, Belarus and Moldavia, this is my country. Sakhalin and Kamchatka, the Urals, this is my country. Krasnoyarsk, Siberia and Volga Kazakhstan and Caucasus and the Baltics as well. Born was I in the Soviet Union, I was made in the USSR. Born was I in the Soviet Union, I was made in the USSR. Victory Day! Victory Day! Now, those are our boys, having a good time in Berlin! Someday we'll think back and won't believe it ourselves. But now we need this victory. One for all, no matter the cost. One for all, no matter the cost. Deadly fire awaits us, And yet we are not scared. Do not fear! Out we go into the night, our Tenth Infantry battalion, our Tenth Infantry battalion. Hurrah! To victory! One morning at dawn, I looked into the neighbor's garden. A Moldavian girl with black curls was picking grapes. The candle is burning down, the battle thunders nearby. Pour, my friend, in the glass our front ration. Pour, my friend, pour in the glass our front ration. Let’s not waste time, like old friends, we’ll have a good talk. Let’s not waste time, like old friends, Let’s not waste time, like old friends, we’ll have a good talk. We’ve been away from home for so long, where a pine tree stands above the river, like in a fairy tale, in a kingdom far away. It has fresh needles, sweet like honey. It has fresh needles and all the pine cones, they're sweet as honey. We belong together. - We are all Soviets. I am an Italian. I am an Italian. Where does homeland begin? With good and loyal friends who live next door. But maybe with the very song that our Mother sang to us, and in spite of all the hardships, will forever remain in our hearts. Where does homeland begin? With my favorite bench at the door, with the birch tree there in the field, rocking gently in the wind. But maybe with the very song the starling sings in spring and with the path through that field which winds up to the horizon. Where does homeland begin? With windows lit far away with Father's old Budyonny hat which we found one day in the closet. But maybe also with the clacking of the locomotive's wheels with the oath you gave in your youth when you pledged your heart to her... Where does homeland begin? I don't understand. - I really don't understand. Another mentality. - Excuse me? Another mentality is why you don't understand. It's got nothing to do with mentality. The fascists rebuilt the German Army. This people's... it's no army, this people's... It was East Germany, not West Germany. The people were East Germany. Yes! - The West is also the people. Not all fascists. West Germany took all the old fascists in office, built up the military. Now there they are in Latvia, back at the Russian border. That is Germany now. Why Germany bad? It's bad because it's overrun by fascists again. Federal Germany is not Reich. It's not Reich... It is republic, no? Formally, it's a republic. But the military was build up by old Nazi generals. It was the Nazi generals... - Go learn some history... Then later... we talk. It is a fact. Nowadays. That other question, This is a dumb question. Dumb question from your side. Both you and I, we were foot soldiers In summer heat, in winter cold, Our record’s set fair and square, Our record’s set fair and square, Our record’s set fair and square, Pick up your coat, let’s go home. The scythe of war cut us to pieces, But now the war is no more. Four years mother mourns her child. Four years mother mourns her child. Four years mother mourns her child. Pick up your coat, let’s go home. Our streets have burnt to ashes Again, again, my dear friend! But look – the starlings are returning, But look – the starlings are returning, But look – the starlings are returning, Pick up your coat, let’s go home. And now your eyes’re shut forever You sleep under a plywood star. Wake up, wake up, my dear comrade, Wake up, wake up, my dear comrade, Wake up, wake up, my dear comrade. Pick up your coat, let’s go home. What shall I say to your old folks, How can I face your widow’s eyes... No use in yesteryear glory, No use in yesteryear glory, No use in yesteryear glory. Pick up your coat, let’s go home. We all are offsprings of this battle, All orphans – generals and troops. Again the spring has come to haunt us, Again the spring has come to haunt us, Again the spring has come to haunt us. Pick up your coat, let’s go home.
