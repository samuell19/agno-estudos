It's great to see you, my brother. - A long time, yes. - What brings you in today? Um, I have a special situation I'm hoping that you can help me with. Oh, my goodness. They don't have any papers. I don't have any paperwork. I was hoping maybe you could help. Your compassionate heart has gotten you in the trouble once again, I see. Yes, my wife reminds me. I believe he's going to be okay. There will be no need for the papers. I will handle it. Thank you, brother. I will pay you in cash. No, no pay. You are doing your part and I will do mine. It is my honor. I owe God much for the mercy and kindness He has shown me and my family. Your arm feels better? Yes. Yes. God is great. [phone ringing] Brother Sarkis. All is good. His arm is on the mend. We are coming home. Yes. I'll be home shortly. [incoming call beeping] Uh, hold. Don't go. I have another call. I think it is the doctor. Wait. Okay. I'll be back. Hello. JIRAIR: Bedros Stepenyan? Yes. JIRAIR: This is Agent Jirair Avagyan, NSS. We have heard from the Netherlands government of three undocumented children who were taken from their home. We believe they are in your possession. Yes? Yes. JIRAIR: We're going to bring you into the department for interview. Follow the escort vehicle. - [sirens wailing] - Yes, I see him. JIRAIR: For your own safety, do not try to flee. Brother Sarkis, tell the children to keep praying. [dramatic music] [door opening] Please, sir, I didn't know how long I would wait. I'm here many hours and my throat is a little dry. Is it possible to get a glass of water, please? You are a citizen of Armenia. Yes? Yes. Then you understand we have absolutely no tolerance for kidnappers. Children are our nation's greatest treasure. Anyone who would dare to take that must be punished to the fullest extent of the law. It is not what you think. I did not take the children. Yet you have them. Yes, but I did not take them from their home. Where did you take them from? From their home, but not their true home? They were staying with a woman in Spitak. They were weak and sick. And I could see they could not live long - if they stayed there. - You took them forcibly? No. She begged us to take them. She had nothing. No food, no medicine. She knew they would die if they lived there. The boy. His testimony confirms what you say. As does his mother's. Now what you've done is a crime, you understand. Punishable by life in prison. By the nod of my head, two men will come through that door and take you from this room. And you will never see the shining sun again, huh. But I too am a papa. Three beautiful girls. If they were taken from me, I would not sleep 'til I had hunted down the abductors and personally executed them in the open square. But if I found them in the care of a man like you, who would risk his own life to keep them safe, 'til I could find them, I would call that man my friend. I will do what I can to help you unite them with their mama. You've done your part. I will do mine. I have spoken with the officials in Holland and they have granted the children temporary visas for seven days only. These applications for the children's papers must be complete and approved before then. Now, it could take months to process these papers. Their mama doesn't have months. She has weeks to live, days, perhaps. So, you must complete these forms as quickly as possible. And I will expedite the processing. Their flight leaves seven days from now. The children must be on this plane. I have extended myself greatly to create this opportunity. I cannot duplicate the process. If they are not on this flight, it could be years before the papers are processed. They will never see their mom again. You understand? This plane is their only hope. I understand. Thank you for your kindness. I have shown no kindness. We've only done what I've deemed right, according to the rules of Armenian law. [door unlatching] Go. Go. And friend... this organization is not recognized for its compassion. But for the firm enforcement of the law. Best to keep it that way, huh? Of course. NAOMI: How are you feeling, sister? Well enough to convince you. Anna, I wish this were true. But you need this for your recovery. Hey. I will bring the children to you quickly, all right? I forgive them. Who? Those men who did this. God has brought us to him. Who am I to question his face? I pray for them every day. That they, too, may know about light and the hope of Christ. Truly, you are strongest woman I have ever met. Do you really believe this? With all of my heart. Then take me with you. Why should I die here alone? Waiting. No. No. Absolutely no. We're here. We're going to miss you. Before we leave, I want you to promise me... To promise us... That you will never, ever forget the miracle that God has done here. And just remember, whenever you are fearful... No matter what, he always, always prepares a way for his children. Okay, let's go catch a plane. Are you ready to fly? - ARMEN & SIRAN: Yes. - Yeah! Hello. Passports? The children don't have passports. These documents is all they have. They must have passports. Yes, I understand. We understand. But this is a special case and we have official documentation and special arrangement with the Armenian government. They do not fly without passports. You must let them through. Their mother has been sick. Please. - Come with me. - BEDROS: No, no. Come with me. - She's harmless. - You come now. - She's harmless. No, no. - Anoush. Anoush. - AGENT: What? - AGENT: You come now. Please, sir. I'm sorry. We did not mean to cause disruption. And it is absolutely critical that these children board this plane. Do you know how many travelers fly out of Zvartnots each year? A hundred thousand... 100,000. Over three million. Three million, of course. Yes. That's a lot. And do you know what each of these passengers share in common? - They are all... I mean... - Passports. I should know that one. Yes, of course. Passports. But we have communicated directly with the Armenian government. We have made an arrangement, a special arrangement. If there were an arrangement, surely, I would know of this. Yes? Yes, of course. There must have been a mistake. And who was this arrangement made with? I'm not supposed to say. It is an agent. His name is Jirair Avagyan. Of the NSS? Impossible. Phone him. If I'm lying, I will leave peacefully. If you are lying, you won't go anywhere. [whispering] Don't worry, Bedros. Even if we are afraid, God is watching over us. Preparing the way. Just like you said. Yes, Ho van. Yes, yes. Yes. I approved it myself. Are the children on the plane? - No, they're not. - What? Sorry, sir. This is the first I'm hearing of this. How is this possible? The documents were sent priority to Officer Zakardian's desk two days ago. Agent Zakardian has been on vacation since Monday. Now listen to me very carefully, Harcom. You must get those children on that plane. Their visas expire tonight. I will accept no excuses. You understand? Yes, sir. The children must be on this plane. But by now, I'm afraid... What is it? It is too late. - It is already boarded. - Then we must go. It is impossible. You cannot make it. With all due respect, officer, God is with us. So, never tell me what we cannot do. Let's go. - [whistle blowing] - Hurry. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse us. Hurry. Children, hurry. [whistle blowing] Run, children. - Gate seven, go, go, go! - ANOUSH: Wait, wait! Please. Three more. We have three more. These children absolutely must be on that plane. I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. - No, no. - Of course there is. - Yes. - You can open this door. I'm afraid opening this door will not help. The airplane has already left the gate. It's preparing for takeoff. You must book another flight. There is no other flight. I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry. ♪♪♪ ANOUSH: Don't worry. God is in control. He will make a way. Shh. No, no, don't cry. Don't cry. Anoush? Yes, my love. Why the plane is turning around? Why the plane is turning around? [hopeful music] It is coming back. It is coming back. It is finished. Thank you, God. Thank you, God. Are you all right? Do you need to go back to the hospital? I am exactly where I must be. No. You should be at the hospital. [announcement over PA] [melancholic orchestral instrumental] ♪♪♪ [coughing] Okay. Enough. They missed the plane. We must get you back. No, please. Maybe they are on the next one. Then they will visit you in your room, as it should have been from the beginning. [coughing hoarsely] Anna. Anna. Look. [hopeful orchestral instrumental] ♪♪♪ Hi, Mom! Armen. You are a man now. You kept your brother and sister safe all these years. I'm so proud of you. Sir an. Oh. [sighing] You are a beautiful young woman. I can see you still have a tender heart. I love you, Mama. Ho van.
