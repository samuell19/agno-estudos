What'S fiShy? - There were theSe two guyS... who came to have rabri yeSterday. They had half a plate each... their tummieS churned and they paSSed out. They had theSe Small children with them. I wonder what haS happened! Bhola! Give them Some rabri! - No thank you! We don't want any! LookS like you don't care for your good health. You're going to eat the rabri. - I would... but you haven't brought any. You're a Smart man. Why are you looking at me like that? - I like you very much. You're lying. But I'll take it for the truth. Where do you live? - In lndia. Every city iS my home. I go anywhere my boSS aSkS me to go. It'S fun liStening to you. Really, I like your innocence. I know a bit of EngliSh. But I meSS up when you talk rapidly. I Said, I like your innocence. Bye. What could be her name...? I'm an idiot! When an ugly man like me iS called sunder (handSome)...

Right. ClaSS 8 at the night School. There aren't any cuStomerS in the reStaurant, Sir... How will there be? You treat the cuStomerS badly. I've received a complaint.

You're Still a kid. You've killed my fowl! - I'm Sorry... but it Sprang before the car. Buy another, if thiS one iS dead. The lady will pay you for it. Here'S 20 rupeeS. - 20 RupeeS?! What do you think the fowl waS? It waS a fighter! I earned hundredS of rupeeS when it fought for me! But 20 RupeeS iS all I have. - That'S all...? But you do have the jewellery. - Let me go, raScal! Help! Help! What'S up? - she haS killed my fowl. We want 200 buckS. - 200...? For a fowl? You haraSS a lone woman, eh? Who the hell are you to interfere? scram! What if I refuSe to go?

Forgive me, my friend. You appear to be an officer in Some big company. YeS. I'm the branch manager for WilSon and Company. You mean you only Sign thingS. How much iS the Salary? 2000 RupeeS. - 2000 RupeeS! Gawd! Which meanS even your peon makeS more than I do! I'm paid 50 buckS every month. - Cut the crap and Sit here with me. And let'S talk in the old Style. - You've made it big, Amar. Had you Studied Sincerely... you'd have made it big too. How could I Study? I changed 16 SchoolS to reach ClaSS 4. You know how intereSted I waS in dramaticS, rather than in my bookS. That intereSt and the flattery of a few other guyS decided my future. Their flattery drove me mad. "You're Such a great actor, sunder" You're a great dancer. You're going to give the actorS a run for their money. And that iS what brought me to Bombay. From Bombay TalkieS to Jyoti studioS, I went everywhere... For three yearS, I lived on the bread and frieS at Naaz Cinema. I Still owe the guyS money. AS a reSult... I wore out my footwear, and all I had waS 10 paiSa. Ten and ten makeS it twenty. Forgive me. - lt'S okay. I had ten paiSa, found ten more, and now thiS ten makeS it thirty. What will you have?

Why Scream? They Serve lentil-curry free in every hotel. Don't Stare at me. Out with the money. Money...? - Why did you eat without any money? I thought I had the money, Sir. Take him inSide, Chaman. And get the money out of him. How'll they get the money out of him? - He waSheS 60 diSheS. 60 diSheS for 30 paiSe? - Oh yeS. I believe, you muSt check your pocket before you Step into an eatery. The bloody freeloaderS. How much iS my bill? 30 paiSe. D'you want anything more? - I don't want to waSh utenSilS. 30 paiSe. sir, my pocket haS betrayed me. - Really? Try putting Some money in it... what a let down! It'S torn. Trying to con me, are you? - Life haS conned me, Sir. Where do you waSh the diSheS? - What do you mean? send me in. I'll waSh 60 utenSilS for the 30 paiSe. You appear to be a poor man. - If I were a rich man, Sir... thiS torn pocket would Set a trend. People would tear their pocketS... to imitate me. - Want a job? What elSe can I aSk for? I'm game, Sir. Any experience at being a waiter? - What'S So great about it, Sir? I tell the cuStomer what he'S eating haS juSt been prepared. I'll paSS of Stale for freSh... that much of lieS iS a muSt, right? Manager, take down thiS boy'S name. - Don't let my face miSlead you, Sir. My name iS sunder (handSome). That which God decideS eventually happenS. You muStn't loSe hope, sunder. - I've divorced hope and deSpair. We're very happy now. - You and who elSe? Ma and l - Ma! IS She with you? Let'S go and meet her. - I'm on duty right now. Where do you live? - Near the bridge at Chinchpokli... behind the Scrap-Seller'S Shop at Kakaji'S wadi... aSk anyone about me. Even the kidS know me. You haven't changed one bit! - I'm going to reSume dutieS. Coming. Amar! - YeS. BleSS you. Come in. How'S your father? - He'S fine. What glory I Saw you in... and what'S your State now. That'S deStiny, Son. - I happened to meet sunder today. He told me everything. How could you forget that I'm like your Son too? I loSt my own mother and alwayS conSidered you to be my mother. You have brought me up! - lt'S beSt to forget the paSt, Son. I'll arrange for a houSe tomorrow. You and sunder will live with me. You know how sunder iS, Amar. He'S a Self-reSpecting man like hiS father. He'd rather Starve, than Stretch hiS handS before hiS brother. But you will live with me now. - You don't know, Son... motherS never deSert a Son who'S going through difficultieS. I get it. You're a proud man'S mother. Why will you go with me? More than what you offer, I think your affection iS great, my Son. You are the one who'S great. I Saw sunder at Hotel RaSraj today. - That'S where he workS. seeing him in a waiter'S uniform, my heart Sank. A waiter...? He workS aS a waiter? - YeS. But he told me that he'S the manager there. Do not be Sad. I'll take care of him. Amar, EngliSh gentleman! Good day! see Amar, ma? He haS become So fair-Skinned! When I told Amar that you're here with me... he galloped here to meet you. He loveS uS So much! What a firSt-claSS Suit! You look like a hero! ThiS imported clotheS... Ma, why are you Staring at me? I went to the market... I've brought ladyfinger and Some other Stuff. Take it inSide. Check out the board. I forgot to tell you Something important. That'S why I came running after you. I've lied to ma that I'm the manager of the hotel. Don't you tell her that I'm a mere waiter there. It will break my mother'S heart. What way of Stretching iS that? - You don't know, ma. It hurtS to work in the officeS. There'S So much to do. People normally have one table for one man. I have So many! People Sit plonked on chairS... and I keep moving around. From thiS table to that... Well done! You're laughing? - Who elSe will, if not my ma? Don't talk about it. - When there are a Stack of fileS... on my deSk, I throw them all away. - Later. Look after Amar for now. YeS, Sir...? Tell your mother I will come later. Okay? Ma, give me Some food... I'm Starving. Lovely plate! Ma... why are you quiet? And See what Style Amar liveS in? He'S every inch a gentleman! Where did he meet you? - At Hotel RaSraj. Why had you gone there? - For a cup of tea. From office? Which office? - The hotel'S office... there are many departmentS. - Which department are you in? Catering. - What do you do? You're grilling me like a lawyer. AS if I've committed a crime! What bigger crime than a Son cheating hiS mother and lying to her? What lieS have I told you? - Haven't you lied to me...? You are a waiter in that hotel! Why don't you Speak? YeS, ma. I'm a waiter in the hotel. But that'S the only lie I told you. - The only lie. How much of Salary do you get? - 50 RupeeS. You give me 50 rupeeS every month. Where do you get the other 50 from? Do you think I Steal the money, ma? - A liar can even Steal! I don't Steal, ma. I carry lunch for School-kidS during my afternoon break. Why did you hide all thiS from me? No work iS bad. I didn't tell you becauSe it would make you Sad. I'm Sad now becauSe my Son haS lied to me. so forgive me, ma. I'll never lie again. I'll turn turtle for you... - Do anything. I'm not going to talk to you. - I won't talk to you either. I won't eat. I'll Starve to death! Who aSked you to eat? - When did I Say Someone aSked me? One little lie I told you and you create a Scene! How about the lie you told me? - What? Have I lied to you? You have alwayS lied to me! - When have I lied to you? Don't you alwayS Say, "sunder iS So handSome..." "he'S So good-looking. AS radiant aS the Moon..." ISn't that a lie? - Not at all, Silly boy... that iS not a lie. It'S the truth. For me, my Son, you are even better looking than God. And not even God meanS more to me than you, ma. And whatever I did waS only becauSe I worShip you. Forgive me, ma. PleaSe. Ma, I waS kidding when I Said I'd die of Starvation... I'm very hungry. - Come. Take a look at thiS Snap, dear. He'S an educated boy who holdS a very nice poSt. Do you like him? Even educated girlS bluSh when they hear about their marriage. He'S coming to meet you at 4 p.m. tomorrow. "lt waS perhapS for thiS day..." "that you came into my life aS my Saviour" "You have filled my heart with love" sunder? Welcome? What'S in that bundle? - I prayed for my dad'S Soul today. I brought Some food. - Really? Give it to me. It'S So deliciouS. It'S ageS Since I ate what Ma made. One muSt Sweeten hiS tongue before Setting out for Something nice. What nice thing are you going for? I'm going to look up a bride for mySelf. Great! But I've already found a bride for me. Really? Who'S it...? - Her eyeS, her lipS... she'S beautiful! AbSolutely Stunning! What are you Staring at me for? You're So good looking, Amar. And l... Can a girl ever fall in love with me, Amar? The girl you like iS in love with you, iSn't She? That'S what I think. But I have my doubtS when I look at my face. she'S really good-looking... and I'm good looking only in name. Good lookS aren't really neceSSary for the male. Abraham Lincoln and John Bernard shaw weren't good looking men. But their name iS etched in golden letterS. some men are worShipped for their qualitieS... and Some are loved for what they are. - But I'm a mere buttler! I've got to be there anytime. - Anarkali waS a courteSan... but salim fell in love with her. What you Say iS making my hopeS grow. - No matter what you are, sunder... you muSt never conSider yourSelf to be Small and petty. I'm getting courage. - Love iS blind... it knowS not barrierS of richeS and lookS. That'S exactly why She Said, "l like you" Really? - YeS. We met at a picnic... She then came to the eatery with her friendS and left her bag behind. she returned all alone and aSked me, "are you married?" There it iS! she'S in love with you and wantS to marry you! IS that true, Amar? Give that to me on a piece of paper! Don't avoid it. Give it to me in writing! Idiot! You Should've poured your heart out to her. Ever Since She Spoke to me, I've forgotten mySelf. The truth iS that I even breathe in the hope of having her love. I'm afraid, Should She turn me down, I'll be Sunk... I cannot live without her, Amar. I can put my Stamp on it! she won't let you die. God bleSS you. Now tell me who the girl iS. Who'S She? Tell me. - No. C'mon! - That girl... iS the daughter of the owner of hotel RaSraj. Radha! What are you thinking about? I think you muSt improve your claSS to marry her. You mean from ClaSS 8 to poSt-graduation...? I'll grow old by then, Amar. That'S not the claSS I Spoke about. You muSt improve on your StatuS. JuSt don't worry about it. It'll happen Soon. You were going to meet your proSpective bride, right? Hurry up. No. It'S too late. Won't that poor girl be diSappointed when you don't turn up? No. I know She won't be diSappointed. Amar, the day you go meet that girl, you muSt take me along! Indeed! You will walk ahead, and I'll follow you. Oh yeS, I'm taking you Somewhere tomorrow, sunder. Come dreSSed in Some nice clotheS. I can give you the money if you don't have any clotheS. sunder. That'S not the point. The queStion iS, how do I manage leave? I'll meet the boSS then! Bye! How much more will you wait, Radha? He'S not coming. We muSt leave. - Let'S go. Wow! ThiS Shirt haS no arm. Mr Rat haS done a nice job! JuSt one Shirt to go, God... preServe my honour. Have pity on me, God. Wow! ThiS Shirt iS great. Thank You, God. But it'S dirty. It StinkS. What am I going to do...? I get it! "The clotheS in your family are dazzling, USha" "And why not? I waSh my clotheS with sunder-brand Soap" Method of uSing the Soap.. ToSS it from behind, catch it right here. Put it in the water and rub... Once rubbed, pull it out. If the garment iS very dirty, rub it on the waShing-Stone. squeeze the garment, once you have rinSed it. Once you had Squeezed it, give it a proper Spread. And now look at the wonderS of sunder-brand Soap! He aSked me to wear nice clotheS. Didn't he, God? Give it to me, Daata (God). - Daata won't give it to you. He takeS money from me for hiS buttermilk. You need 15 rupeeS, iSn't it? I'll give it to you. Great! ThiS iS God in the form of my mother. It'S for your feeS, iSn't it? - YeS. I'm teSting my deStiny. Hurry up and pay the feeS. You are great, Lord. Hello, Amar. Who'S thiS...? Get out! - I've brought him with me. He'S a waiter, iSn't he? - YeS. He'S alSo my childhood friend.

Aren't your own kidS Scared of you? Look at your own face before you make fun of my lookS! You look like a Sucked out mango! sunder! Don't inSult him! - Why haS he inSulted me? You know, Amar.

You're working in my next film. - How about my teeth? JuSt don't worry about that. - LookS like you've made many filmS. You haven't much hair left. - Oh yeS. I've made 3 filmS. sunder, beSt of luck. God help you. - CongratulationS, sunder. see? He haS Signed him on. You muSt Sign him too. Or he'll take to wingS once he haS a releaSe. sit down, sunder... Sit down, I Say. You will do my film too. - You are very kind. Let'S talk about the contract. - Later. At my place. Ma, give me your bleSSingS. From a waiter, I've now become a film actor! What? A film actor? What are you thinking about, ma? TruSt me... even if I make it big, I'll never forget theSe difficult dayS. AS you wiSh, my Son. You have my bleSSingS. May you achieve SucceSS. May you become a big man. - My mother! I'm going to the temple. Give me the Strength, Lord. I've taken the mantle of making people laugh. I don't want people to poke fun at me. Idiot! You get one film and you Start throwing tantrumS! You aSk the producer to come home! - I couldn't help it! I went crazy when I Saw the cheque for a thouSand rupeeS. I forgot who I am. Know Something, Amar? All thiS haS happened thankS to you. I muSt Seek your bleSSingS after ma. Give me your bleSSingS today. - What are you doing? someone'S here, sunder. - You...? How come you're here...? CongratulationS. I'm told you have got a film. YeS. How did you get to know? - From the hotel. And I'm very intereSted in your progreSS. I know. What iS it...? - she'S the one! PleaSe Sit down. Amar! Get up! PleaSe Sit down. I'm So Sorry... one moment, okay? sit ThiS iS Radha. The daughter of the owner of hotel RaSraj. And thiS iS my beSt friend, Amar. Manager of WilSon Company. ThiS iS the firSt time you've come here... and ma'S away at the temple. so what do I do? It'S okay! The two of you have a chat, I'll return in a moment. I've lit the Stove. But what am I going to prepare? some flour halwa! Oh yeS! You muSt be SupriSed to See me here? I'm not SurpriSed. I'm happy. - May I aSk... why you didn't turn up the other day? - l? Why would I turn up? In that caSe, why did you give my father the wrong impreSSion? I think he'S Still under the wrong impreSSion. What wrong impreSSion? - You know that. Only your father doeSn't know that you're in love with sunder. What are you talking about? - Do not be angry. sunder himSelf told me. He loveS you very much. You muStn't defame a woman. If you don't want to marry me you can Say you don't approve of me. I waS coming over becauSe I approved of you. But when sunder told me... - LieS! He haS told you lieS! I'll aSk him right now! How am I to blame if Someone miStakeS my Sympathy for love? PleaSe Speak Softly. He Said you told him that you like him. I did. I told him that not once, but many timeS. I liked hiS innocence, hiS jokeS. I Still like it. But that doeS not mean I'm in love with him. He doeSn't know much of EngliSh. He'S too Simple and naive. That'S exactly why I Showed Some intereSt in him. You once met him at the reStaurant and aSked him, "Are you married?" YeS, I did. I wondered how a poor married man could be making out. You wanted him to make progreSS? - Of courSe. I'm alSo reSponSible for thiS miSunderStanding. He miStook Some thingS. And l fed him Some more wrong notionS. But why blame me for it? I'll Sort it out with him right now! No, Radha... it'll break hiS heart. The poor man adoreS you and he'S trying to improve hiS StandardS... So he can be worthy of you. And he'll Surely make it big Some day. He haS the confidence... and I have faith in him. You are hiS well-wiSher too. Can't you change your Sympathy into love for my Sake? You are truly sunder'S friend. I reSpect your SentimentS. But why are you forgetting that love happenS not on itS own... it iSn't induced on Someone'S Say So. AS for SympathieS, I Still have them. I know that. - What you perhapS don't know... iS that like sunder, I have made miStake too. I Saw your photograph and when I got to know that you were coming over... I took you for my own, without even finding out how you felt about me. ThiS will kill sunder'S aSpirationS, Radha. He haSn't any life without you. - That'S my predicament, too. You can forget me becauSe of your friend. But I cannot forget you for anyone'S Sake. What am I to do? I'm caught between the devil and the deep blue SeaS! sunder'S aSpirationS muStn't die before they bloSSom. Can you do Something for me, Radha? - I can even die for you... only don't aSk me to forget you. Till Such time aS sunder iS SucceSSful... we muSt keep thiS a Secret from him. BecauSe to have you iS what giveS him courage. It'S hiS Support and reaSon to live. - He will get to know Some day. Won't he Say I have cheated and betrayed him? He'll have a Stronger heart by then. He'll develop the will to bear it. The dazzle of fame and SucceSS might leSSen the paSSionS that rage in him. We will then diScloSe it to him. It'll be a favour to me, Radha. Not to sunder. "No dearth of SpoonS (SycophantS)..." "look for you, you will find thouSandS" "Here comeS the Storm" The two of you are So Silent. And I aSked you to have a chat. Radhaji, thiS iS the firSt Sweet day in my life. And it'S all thankS to my friend, Amar. Have Some... you, too, Amar. How about you? - Not me... I've Sweetened my tongue with the joy! I'll be happier to See you eat it. You muSt have Some from thiS. - In that caSe, wait a minute. You've both given me So much. It'S going to be too much of Sweet. No, not too much of Sweet. Take what I give you to be bland. - I'll be reSponSible for that too. I'm the one who made it. - The one who eatS... can be reSponSible, too. He can alSo make miStakeS. No. It could be the ignorance of the one who makeS it. Or it could be Sheer haSte... - No, sunder. It'S deliciouS. I made it in the hope that you would like it. Eat. I muSt leave, sunder. - Give that to me. Radha, dear... - Father! I'm glad to See you happy today. - I met Amar, father... he'S coming to See you. He had a reaSon for not turning up the other day. Where did you meet him? - That waiter sunder, you know? He haS got a role in a film. He haS become an actor. I went to congratulate him and met Amar at hiS place. He'S sunder'S true friend, father. And he wantS to marry me. so the two of you have even finaliSed your wedding? Oh no, father. I won't do anything againSt your wiSheS. suppoSe I Say... "You can't marry Amar" I know. My father would never Say Such a thing. I See! Where are you going all dreSSed up? - I'm going to work. so why put on airS? You're going to the reStaurant, aren't you? Oh no. I've become a film actor, you See. Want Some money for buttermilk? - No, my Stomach iS full already. sunder... no! Brother-dear... Brother-dear? What'S the new name for? - BecauSe you have become an actor. May your filmS turn out to be Silver jubilee runnerS! May you achieve SucceSS. And may I grow in Stature too. All right. I muSt leave. The director wantS me in early. Brother-dear... where the Star goeS, the Sychophant followS him. What doeS that mean? - You're a Star... and I'm going to be your Secretary. sit properly... you can't even Sit properly. New face, eh? I wonder which SpecieS you belong to. I've never been an aSS, I aSSure you. - That I can See. say Something! - say, my foot! You've made a grindStone out of my mouth! I've created So many StarS thiS way. I'll make you too. You're Sure going to be a comedian. I'm here, Sir. - so? Go on in there! What are you looking at? - I waS told... that I'd deliver my lineS Standing in a hall on the firSt floor. But there iSn't a roof here... no StepS either. Where'S firSt floor? You let your tongue run away with you in the firSt film, eh? C'mon! Idiot! Director Saab... - That'S him. Don't you know, I'm the director? Okay. It'll do. Do what, Sir? They piled the greaSepaint on me. Will the clotheS do? Will do. Have you made him rehearSe hiS lineS? YeS, Sir. - How about madam? I've given it to her. - ThiS iS our heroine, MiSS PaSha. The dreamgirl! - ThiS iS my new face... the new actor, sunder. You give break to theSe new guyS and they feed on uS! I only feed on vegetableS, lady. - Poor chap iS a new actor. He haS the fire in him. - lt'S So very hot today. shutup! He'S a very ambitiouS boy. You're the one I'm talking to. Come here. Let not the fact that you're working with a big Star intimidate you. And you muStn't let the fact that you're working with a new actor... make you meSS up your lineS. Director! I know thiS woman! she'S the one with the whiSkerS! WhiSkerS? Where are they? - Not on her face. KidS draw whiSkerS on her face on the poSterS in town. You're playing a Servant, sunder. And madam iS the maid-Servant. The two of you... - What iS that? You're in love. - Love? With her? All right. I'm SuppoSed to be in love with the maid Servant. Let'S have a rehearSal. something wrong with your make up. It'S okay. - All right. It'S okay. Where'S the new guy? - What are you doing here...? C'mon! What are you doing? Do you beat up newcomerS? Let'S have another rehearSal. - Do I need a rehearSal? Oh no. Let'S take then. If you want him to do a rehearSal, aSk Someone to Stand in for me. Do you need a rehearSal, sunder? No? Let'S take then. - Ready, sir. I haven't had anything, Sir. May I have a glaSS of water? Don't you even get water at home? - All right. I don't want anything. - Ready. - LetS take now. What happened?

BecauSe no School in lndia haS the recordS of my StudieS. I'm an actor, you See. What difference do you find in your earlier life and now? The anSwer to your queStion iS there on that wall.

Look at from a diStance, it appearS to be Small. Trample it under your feet... it remainS hidden. Difficulty iS what one makeS out of it. Good! Do you ever remember the dayS you Spent aS a waiter? I can't ever forget thoSe dayS. I never will. Which iS why... Where'S my uniform of the waiter that waS hanging on the wall? That uniform looked very obScene on the grand wall. I had it removed. - shut up and put it back there! Do it. Madam, aS long aS that uniform remainS in Sight... I'm not fazed by my wealth. I'm free of any arrogance. Whenever I look down upon the uniform I once uSed to wear... do you know what anSwer I get from the uniform?

That iS the uniform which remindS me of the promiSe I made to her. sorry, I remember my mother now that I Speak of her. It'S time I met her. - One minute, pleaSe. One laSt queStion. - PleaSe hurry up. When are you getting married? - Married? I'll get married. Very Soon. For your information that'S a very beautiful part of my life. something I can never forget. AS you know... in lndia, we don't marry againSt our parentS' wiSheS. I will Seek my mother'S permiSSion, too... and I'm Sure my mother will give me her approval. BecauSe I'm going to have a love marriage. I'll Send you an invitation. Make Sure you attend it. Bring your Staff along too. My beSt wiSheS to all the liStenerS. You have been liStening to an interview with film Star sunder. Hear that? MuSt we remain Silent even now? YeS, sunder here. Did you liSten to my interview on radio? That'S what I waS liStening to. - Very good! Am I now in a poSition to aSk Mr RamSwarup for Radha'S hand? I'm going to meet Radha Soon. - What...? I'm going to lay my love at Radha'S feet. she will accept my love. Do you know what She'S going to tell me... I'm not telling you! I know... what'S going to happen. You Share the Secret of my love. You are my beSt friend, Amar. Pray for me... you're elder to me, you See. Well? Will I have to beg for my beSt friend'S good wiSheS? I have alwayS been your well-wiSher, sunder. That which iS deStined to be, will be. Well, all right. Radha, sunder iS coming to propoSe to you. We made a miStake by hiding the truth from him all theSe dayS. You muSt tell him everything before he comeS to me. Where will I bring the courage from? I waS Silent all theSe dayS, becauSe you aSked me to. I had Sealed my lipS for the Sake of my friendShip. If sunder were to aSk me... if I can't Sacrifice my love for hiS Sake... I won't be able to refuSe him. I don't have the courage to Say no! sit down, sunder. I want to talk to you. I know what ma'S going to aSk me today. You've heard about my love-marriage on radio, didn't you? That'S what I want to aSk you about. - Every mother muSt aSk. But there'S a method to that... it muSt be done artiStically. How about a rehearSal, ma? How do I tranSlate that in Hindi? How about faking it, ma? All right. - Now SuppoSe I'm the mother... and I aSk, "Well, my boy? since when have you been in love?" Don't laugh. ASk it the way I did. since when have you been in love? - Wow! That'S a nice act, ma! And the Son then SpeakS... - Why're you digging your noSe? That'S how it workS nowadayS, ma. ASk me the queStion again. since when have you been in love? Ever Since we have Set eyeS on each other, ma... You go around eyeing girlS! That'S my line, iSn't it? YeS, but it'S only a rehearSal. Go Slow on the Slap. The Son then tellS hiS mother in a quivering voice... "I've been eyeing only one girl, ma" And the mother SayS, "Are you going to marry her?" The Son SayS, "PleaSe give me the permiSSion to marry her" What doeS the mother Say? And the Mother SayS, "Why tomorrow? Get married to her today itSelf!" But who'S the girl? Where iS She from? I'm not going to tell you that. That'S the SuSpenSe. All right. Now let'S begin at the beginning. Why muSt l? AS my mother, you muSt aSk me. so when are you marrying? - That'S like hurling StoneS, ma! ASk me lovingly, So I can get married immediately. since when have you been in love, my Son? It'S about two or three yearS now, ma. so when are you marrying her? - Marriage? Not yet, ma. You won't? - No. so don't get married! - Ma! We're only acting! I'm Sunk! Look! A film actor! What a performance he gave in "Biwi Ka Ghulam" Hello, Radha. - You...? Welcome! sit down. IS your dad in? - He haS gone out. I had Something to diScuSS with him. I'll come again, when he'S around. LiSten... what iS it? How can I tell you when we're all by ourSelveS? It'S okay. Tell me. - I've been dying to tell you. And I've done So many Such SceneS in filmS, Radha. But every Scene waS cut halfway through the act. That'S how we laughed when the director meSSed up. AS I Said... what waS I Saying? I can't bring to my lipS how I feel at heart. How will I tell you...? All right. No beating about the buSh anymore. I'll Say it Straightaway. I've decided to get married, Radha. - YeS. I heard that on radio. You did? You heard everything I Said? That makeS it eaSy for me! When I waS giving that interview... I felt aS if I waS at the wedding altar, dreSSed aS a bridegroom. In theSe roSeS are my emotionS, Radha. They carry the fragrance of my love. I love you with all my heart... here you are, Radha. Do not be Shy. We love each other... Why are you Silent? No... No, Radha. Don't turn me down and break my heart. No, sunder. ThiS can't be. PleaSe forgive me. I really liked your innocence and the way you joked, sunder. That'S exactly why I fooled around with you. It waS aS if I waS talking to my brother... and joking with him... that waS the feeling I had, sunder. I've never had a SiSter, Radha. Maybe that iS why I couldn't underStand how you felt. But I can't believe thiS... have I really miSunderStood you? Have you never been in love with me? - No, sunder. Never. Don't Say that, Radha. - I could never imagine... that Such miSunderStandingS would crop up... if an unmarried girl Spoke to a boy like thiS. I didn't know that Such trivia could cauSe you Such anguiSh! I can See the conSequenceS of my ignorance, sunder. You're not the ignorant one, Radha. It'S me. No wonder my mother callS me a fool. I muSt leave now, Radha. I have no right to give you theSe roSeS, Radha. But if you don't mind... keep theSe roSeS in Some Secluded corner of the houSe. Know why? When I waS coming here happily with theSe roSeS... people outSide Saw me arrive. How can I take back thiS bouquet now? They'll laugh at me. They'll poke fun at my love. And I can't bear to See that happen. I want to aSk you for a little preSent, Radha. You'll be amuSed to know what thiS Silly man haS Sought from you. It'S not extra-ordinary... but it'S preciouS to me. I want nothing much, Radha. I want thiS waSte-paper baSket. Know why? Even if thoSe roSeS are proof of my idiocacy to you... for me, they are the reminder of my firSt and only love. I don't want them to end up in thiS waSte-paper baSket. so I'm taking thiS away. What you are Saying iS piercing my heart, sunder! To hurt your feelingS iS like killing mySelf, Radha. I couldn't underStand your feelingS... that iSn't your miStake. It'S mine. I'm the cauSe of all thiS, sunder. PleaSe forget all thiS. What? Forget you...? All right. I'll forget you. And I have decided Something elSe. something very terrible. I'm going to die. - No! Don't Say that, sunder! I'll die... here and now... or maybe 40 yearS later. I made you laugh, didn't l? I've made every man laugh with my jokeS. And now... I'm Sad mySelf. To make mySelf laugh, I'm cracking jokeS. I got to know you love me the day I viSited your houSe, sunder. And I waS about to tell you clearly that I am not in love with you. But your friend Amar Stopped me from telling you. He didn't want you to know the truth... till you had achieved the SucceSS you had Set out for. What Amar Said waS right, Radha. ThiS truth could perhapS have killed me then. I waSn't very Strong at heart. I want to tell you Something more, sunder. It might hurt you when you get to know. I'm getting married to your friend, Amar. With Amar...? CongratulationS, Radha! I'm going to laugh at my defeat! BecauSe I have loSt to Amar! I've loSt to my beSt friend. Amar winS! And I run away! I muSt congratulate Amar... I'll tell you why. What car have we arrived in? - sportS car, Sir. Where'S the lmpala? - lt'S our Shopping, Sir. Go and Start the car. Who'S driving the MercedeS? - Me, Sir. We're going to KaShmir for an outdoor Shot next week. YeS, Sir. The ticketS have arrived. Four men have already left to look after your comfortS.

At the Snap of a finger, my Secretary and driverS come running to me. There are So many carS and people waiting outSide. I didn't do all thiS to Show off to you, Radha. I wanted to Show you that an ordinary waiter of your hotel... Frankly Speaking, I like your innocence. That Silly idiot who didn't follow one word... knowS So much of EngliSh today! And another word I've learnt now. Unwanted. But I'm Saying all thiS to prove my power to you. It'S thankS to whom that I have got all thiS fame and name...? Who waS the one who took my name to Such heightS? The one and only Amar. My beSt friend. Amar haS landed the preciouS diamond... I could never have. Who can be happier than I am? You're crying, Radha? I can't bear to See anyone cry. I'm happy. so why are you crying? so laugh... I'll Sit on a hunger Strike if you don't laugh! I'll feed you the Stuff they Serve in your eatery, if you don't laugh! May God keep you ever Smiling. Ma, I'm leaving for the Shoot. - sit down here. What iS it?
