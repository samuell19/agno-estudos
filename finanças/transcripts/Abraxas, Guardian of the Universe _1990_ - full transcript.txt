(dramatic electronic music) - Have you ever been balded? Let me tell you, it's not very pleasant. It involves reinforcement of skeletal and muscle structures by shortwave irradiation and ozone layering to 0.23. Very painful. It can also knock out your memory, so some researcher came up with the idea to play word association videos while they roast your tissue. - [Computer] Planet of origin? - [Computer] Sargacia. - [Computer] You're a Sargacian? - Some of us are. - [Computer] Some of us are what? - Sargacians. - [Computer] What is Sargacia? - My home planet. - [Computer] I thought it was the home planet of the finder movement. - It is. - [Computer] What division are you, Abraxas? (electricity crackling) Forget the pain, Abraxas. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. - Easy for you to say. (electricity crackling) - [Computer] What division? - Interplanetary ecology. (grunts) - [Computer] No such division. - [Abraxas] It's my division. - [Computer] There's no such division, Abraxas. - That's my division! - [Computer] Mission. - Apprehend a renegade! Finders are required to renew their vows every 100 Earth years. I've renewed my vows about 90 times now. That's right, I've been on the force for almost 10,000 years. - [Computer] What is the law? - [Abraxas] To defend all life. - [Computer] What is the law? - To be loyal to the vow of protection. - [Computer] What is the law? - I will have no relationship before my obligations as a finder. Kick around as long as I have, and you're gonna see it all sooner or later. Now they're sending me out to bring in Secundus, my ex-partner. He'd gone over the top, an occupational hazard for all finders. We see too much, we're around too long. Finders are the cops of the universe. Occasionally one of us goes renegade. (electronic tinkling) (dramatic music) (explosions roaring) (dramatic music) - [Computer] The renegade has been located. Affirmative action in progress. - We have a renegade. - Who is it? - Secundus. - Secundus? Still after a Culmator? - Yes, but now he's re-engineered his DNA coding and he's in a yellow star system. If he mates, probability is the Culmator will be born. - I bet he's got skin like steel after his re-engineering. Have you sent a finder after him? - Yes, I sent Abraxas. I used warp travel. - You used warp travel? Must be some distance you're covering. What sector? - RVS 034. It's a little planet third or fourth from the star in that area. - Intelligence level? - Tertiary. But very advanced technologically. We're barely ahead of them except for warp travel. And a few other things. - Peaceful? - Relatively. We've intervened twice. But basically, they're on the right path. - [Hite] Nice place? - Alright, I suppose. Never been there myself. Inhabitants call the place Earth. - Hm, nice name. Can Abraxas stop the renegade? - We've reinforced his skeletal structure. Vaulted to, t squared. - Weren't Abraxas and Secundus partners? - Ancient history, Hite. Secundus turned bad a thousand years ago. You know that. - You should not have sent Abraxas. - Abraxas can handle it. He's brought Secundus in before. He knows the man, he knows how he operates. - I suppose we'll see, won't we? I know Secundus, I know what he's capable of. - And I know what your problem is, Hite. You really can't stand being at an outpost. - I should be at command central. Instead I'm wasting my career at some god forsaken outpost at the edge of the known universe. Now I have a problem on a planet no one's ever heard of. Abraxas better take care of this. (tense electronic music) - [Abraxas] Secundus and I went back a long way. We pulled each other through a lot of hard times. - [Secundus] Abraxas cannot possibly understand my motives. He believes in right and wrong. (blasters whistling) (explosion roaring) The only thing that matters is power, the power to no longer be a victim of fate. (blasters whistling) (explosion roaring) (blasters whistling) (explosion roaring) (blasters whistling) (explosion roaring) (blasters whistling) (explosion roaring) (blasters whistling) (explosion roaring) (blasters whistling) (explosion roaring) (dramatic music) (car engine humming) (upbeat music) - Carl. Please, come on. - What's the matter? - Carl, stop it. Doesn't have to be the matter with me just because I don't want you falling all over me. - [Carl] Come on, Sonia, please? - Mm-mm. (dramatic music) - [Carl] What the? (engine humming) - He's coming for the car. - [Carl] We're getting out of here. (engine humming) Start, start! Come on! - [Sonia] Get the car started, hurry! Get it started! - Go go go! - Hurry, hurry! (glass shattering) (screaming) - [Carl] Run for it, Sonia, get out of there! (groans) - Are you a birthing member of the human race? - Huh? - I need your body. - [Computer] Communication from command. Secundus is in possession of a fertile birthing member of the species. (dramatic music) - [Sonia] No, please, no, let me go! No, please! Please, no! No! (screaming) (intense rock music) (tense music) (gasping) (dramatic music) - I really do need your body. (electronic humming) - [Computer] DNA infusion complete. Reproduction commenced. - What happened to your face? - I was balded, t-squared. - Looks like they lined your skull with plasteel. - It's over. - Right, I win. The girl will bear my child, and he will be the answer. - Why? You had it all. An almost immortal lifespan. Virtually unlimited power. - Almost, virtually? It's not enough when I can't have it all. The key is the birth of a Culmator. A Culmator will be able to compute the Anti-life equation. That child will be a Culmator. Join me. To stop me now, you have to kill the girl. I know you can't do that. - [Computer] Communication from command. Secundus will be transported to penal planet Tyrannanus 7. A travel warp is offered to him. - (laughing) It doesn't matter, I win! See you soon, Abraxas. - [Computer] Stand clear, travel warp is offered to him. (energy warbling) (melancholy jazz music) Remove the possibility of the birth of Secundus's child immediately. Eliminate the female. To eliminate the offspring upon birth would be hazardous. The anti-life equation could erupt. You have two minutes. (groaning) Order repeated, eliminate the female. You have one minute. (sobbing) (groaning) (dramatic music) Abraxas, you must eliminate the female before birth occurs. You have 30 seconds. - What... Is... Happening... To me? (dramatic music) - [Computer] 15 seconds, Abraxas. (screaming) Five, four, three, two, one. - No! (screaming) - He didn't do it. The Culmator is born! - We don't know if the child is Culmator yet, Hite. - Mere possibility of such an occurrence is sufficient to warrant the death of the woman and the child. (dramatic music) - [Sonia] Here, here. Better? Okay. (melancholy jazz music) (groaning) (melancholy jazz music) (fire crackling) - Sonia, we wanna help you. Yes. This story is so hard to believe. - I'm not asking you to believe me. I'd settle for some help. - Why don't you tell us who the father is? - I, uh, I know this sounds terrible, but I honestly don't know who the father us. - The only thing worse than protecting a delinquent father is not knowing who the father is. - I have nothing to be ashamed of. If you want me to leave this house, I will. - I want you to leave this house. - County of birth? - Simpo. - Town? - Farmbury. - Name? - [Sonia] Name? - The baby's? - Thomas. Thomas Murray. - Name. - Thomas. - Got that, give me yours. - Sonia Murray. - Father. - Um. I'm the only parent. - Come on, lady, what'd you do, find the kid in a parking lot? You wanna register the kid? Okay, how do I know this kid is yours, huh? You got one affidavit signed by yourself, now who's the father? - I'm the mother. (dramatic music) I'm the mother. You don't laugh. You never cry. You never make a sound. Who are you? What are you? Where did you come from? I bet you have a lot of secrets. It's been five years since Tommy was born, five years since that night. We have a nice, fairly regular life, except that Tommy has never spoken, he's never made a sound. Sometimes, I have no idea what he's really thinking. Hurry up, hurry up, I'm gonna get you! I've never told him what his father was. (fire roaring) (shouting) I love him so much, but I'm afraid that something terrible is going to happen to him. I don't now why, but, I have a feeling that something will take him away from me forever. (explosions roaring) Physical reason as far as they can see why he shouldn't be talking. He's apparently capable of it. There's no hearing impairment, he's bright enough. - [Doctor] He's five? - Yep. - Big for five. Seen any other doctors about this? - Yes, about a dozen or so over the years. - Has there been any trauma in Tommy's life at all? - When he was born. He cried a little bit, but then he stopped. - Since then? Not a sound. - [Doctor] Nothing? - [Sonia] Nothing. - [Computer] This is penal planet Tyrannus 7. We confirm the escape of Secundus. - Standby, we will advise. - How did he escape? - [Dar] We're not sure. - Secundus would be irrelevant if you had eliminated the girl before she gave birth. - None of us could be certain her child would possess the anti-life equation. - We're certain now. The readouts indicate the child is a Culmator. The boy may be capable of unconsciously computing the anti-life equation, and Secundus is capable of ripping it right out of his brain. - [Dar] Consciously, Hite, the Culmator is still dormant. - That will change. Secundus will see to it. You should have taken her life. That would've prevented this problem from arising. - You could've executed Secundus. That would've prevented the problem. - He was a finder, Abraxas. - Was. Now he's an uncontrollable malcontent. You should have terminated him. - All finders are necessarily and understandably exempt from execution, it's operational mandate. - My operational mandate does not allow execution of innocent women and children. - Do you realize what you've done? Let me spell it out for you. With the equation, Secundus could gain access to the anti-life universe. If he even attempts entry, a destructive force would be unleashed that would shatter worlds. - I understand, but it still doesn't justify murder of an innocent victim. - You've endangered the lives of millions of people for the sake of one woman and one child. - [Abraxas] I think you're over-dramatizing the situation, Hite. - I think not. Culmators are not legend! If travel warps could handle more than single entities, I would send a platoon down right now. - Can you latch me on to Secundus's warp? - [Dar] I think so. - Another water landing? - Has to be. You're restricted to carbon-based, H20 warps. The plant is 70% water. - Abraxas, you must locate the Culmator and terminate it. Kill the child before Secundus-- - The decision to terminate is mine alone. - Not in this case! - I'll solve the problem my way. - There's no time for this, Hite. Let's pay weaponry a visit. Abraxas, you'll need some heavy artillery. Secundus hit a techno-carrier after he escaped. - [Abraxas] Travel warps are like wormholes connecting different parts of the universe, kind of like a galactic subway system. They're a natural phenomenon that we've learned to use, sometimes successfully, sometimes not. (dramatic music) (explosion roaring) - [Computer] Malfunction, travel warp malfunction. - What happened? - I tried to run parallel with Secundus's travel warp, and the streams crossed. - Abraxas will be stripped naked of his weaponry. - Hite, he'll be lucky to survive. - All they'll have left is their answer boxes. - These indicate that Secundus's answer box is in low charge. He'll be forced to find a repower generation source immediately. That means that Abraxas will have the upper hand initially. - [Hite] Better use it to terminate the Culmator child. (dramatic music) - I thought you were still asleep. Did you have a good sleep? I'm meeting with your principle today. He wants to talk to me about you. You haven't been up to any mischief, have you? No, I didn't think so. Come on, let's get you washed and dressed, huh. (dramatic music) (screaming) - [Principal] So you're Tommy's mother? - Yes. - Is it Mrs. Murray? - No. - You're single. - Yes. - How long has the father been gone? - Since he was born. - Has there been any abuse in the family. - No. - How long has he not been speaking? - (sighs) All his life. - Well do you think maybe that Tommy's acting out 'cause his father isn't around and that he's not speaking because he's angry. - No. I think he's mute. - Have you tried anything with him to get him to speak? I know here, when students are not paying attention, pretending they don't hear me, I try to catch 'em off guard, I go (screams). It gets a little response out of 'em, have you tried anything like that? - What are you getting at, Mr. Latimer? - (sighs) Well Mrs. Murray, I'm sorry, this is a normal school for normal children. - My son is normal. He just needs special attention. - He's getting special attention alright, Mrs. Murray. His presence is causing a problem with the students. Frankly, Tommy scares the piss out of 'em, and they act out, they push him, they call him names, they tease him, constantly. - Why don't you just tell them to stop teasing him, to stop pushing him, to stop calling him all kinds of names? Have you ever thought of just telling them to stop it? - No. I haven't. I'll. I'll try that, I'll speak to the kids. I'll just tell 'em directly. That's a good suggestion, I'm gonna try that. (melancholy jazz music) - [Secundus] Something wrong happened in the travel warp. I was alive, but my weapons had been destroyed. Abraxas had to have suffered the same fate. In hand to hand, I could take him, but first I had to recharge my answer box. (melancholy jazz music) (grunting) (chattering) - I like camping in the fall, the phone reception is better. You've got my fax number, right? (tense music) (grunting) (screaming) Hi, can I help you? Hey! Hey, what do you want? - Hey, what are you doing here? What do you want? - [Man] I'll handle this. - [Computer] I am insufficiently charged to activate this vehicle. - Give me the keys. - I'm not gonna give you my keys. What's your driving record? I've got quality insurance? It doesn't cover high-risk drivers. Like, I'm willing to overlook this if you are. I could sue you for this, you know. Personal harassment. I'm a lawyer, I can litigate. - Give me the keys. (gasps) Grab the keys. Michael, Michael, get the key, get them. - [Michael] Here you go. (intense jazzy music) - You know, you really ought to get an alarm system in here. - For what, to protect a few bags of organic pasta? - [Johnny] Oh, geez, oh I'm sorry. - Um, the country's for, Johnny, there. Drink your wheat grass juice. - Okay. You know, I was wondering. Saturday, I mean if you weren't busy or. (door chimes) - Hey! - Howdy Johnny. How's the law in Dodge City? - Wait, here! Bye. - Stop, stop! Could you please provide me with ground transportation? - How's your girlfriend? - I haven't asked her out yet. - Well why not, Johnny boy? You're the new kid in town. Probably just holding her breath. - I've been busy, know what I mean? - Sounds like fear of failure to me. Yep, fear of failure. It's held many a good man down. Well, I'm gonna grab me a coffee. Come on, I'll buy you one. Say hello to someone else. - [Man Driving RV] I'm on my way to town. I'm gonna report this to the local police. - [Abraxas] I am a police officer. - [Woman] Didn't you hear, the local police? You don't look local to me. - Perhaps you'd have some local clothing I could wear. - [Computer] Sensor indicate appropriate power source in this vicinity. (dramatic music) (metal cracking) (glass shattering) (dramatic jazz music) - [Secundus] The anti-life equation is tantamount to magic. It would make me a god. Anything less is death. (electricity crackling) (computer beeping) - [Computer] Program resumed. Warp travel damage corrected. We are active. - Hey, what are you doing in my shop? - I am recharging my answer box. - Whatever the hell that is, you sure picked the wrong place to do it. - You're quite a big man. - Big enough to take you, pal. - Yes. (grunting) Test for the anti-life equation. - [Computer] Subject does not possess anti-life equation. Testing will result in discorporation. - Run the test. (groaning) (explosion roaring) You failed. - So what makes you think you can locate my four by four. My box has VD, trust me. - Your what? - VD, vibrational detection. Everything, even machinery, has its own particular vibrational frequency. We just can't read them. This device, my answer box, can read and locate anything it's made solid contact with. - And it must be able to pick up this guy as well. - No, members of our force were taught to avoid VD. - [Man Driving] Michael, grab a bunch of those old work clothes from the back. Give them to the man. - Boy's never gonna learn. - Anybody belong to that poor excuse for a forklift out there? Need the safety check, talking now. - It's mine, got a problem with that? - Ah Billy, Johnny here was just doing his job. He doesn't mean anything-- - Sheriff Sharp, that's a 217. - Johnny, Johnny, he just takes the tractor from town to the five, he never causes any harm. - I'm trying to. - I must locate Secundus. - Good luck! - Johnny boy, you got to learn the difference between the spirit of the law and the letter of the law. Now right now, you're trying to act and function on the letter of the law, right Now this is a small town. We got no bad guys up here. You're the one who wanted to get out of the city out to a place where you could really make difference. - I didn't want to spend my time-- - The difference up here is, you're a peace officer, got it? - With all due respect, sheriff, I think peace officer is an antiquated concept. - Huh? - Listen, a police department today is in a constant state of siege. - [Johnny] Look around. Ever corner there's freaks, lunatics, terrorists. - [Sharp] Most people are locals. - We have to be prepared to defend ourselves. - From what, apple-pickers. - [Woman On Radio] Sheriff, we got an emergency at town hall. They say some guy's in there tearing the place up pretty good. - On our way. No bad guys, huh? - [Abraxas] Secundus had the mother's name and would be looking for the location of the Culmator child. He had it pinpointed to this area, but that was basic logic. This was the terminal end of the travel warp. (dramatic music) - Hey. Hey! You work here or what? My electricity got cut off. So what are you gonna do about it? You gonna fix it or what? (siren blaring) - Let her go, Secundus. - Get out of my way or I will crush her skull. - Drop her. - One more bark or whimper from you, and her brain is dust. Just try me. - Do what he says, he will kill her. - Who are you? - I'm a fellow officer. I am in pursuit of this man. - He's not armed. I can nail him. - I don't think so. Do you want the girl to die? - Tell them, Abraxas. They cannot change destiny. Up against the wall. Give me your guns. - Give him your gun, Johnny. - You're right. (groaning) I'll take it. Put your gun in my pocket. (groaning) Follow me, and she dies! Have a nice day. (dramatic music) (grunting) - Hey, don't shoot! - Don't shoot! (gun firing) - Stay. (tense music) (gun firing) (groaning) (gun firing) (screaming) (grunting) - [Johnny] Stop right there, mister! (dirtbike engine buzzing) (dramatic music) (children laughing) - [Child] Come on, Tommy. (children chattering) - That's our slide! - It's everybody's slide. - Not today it isn't! - He's too big, Tommy. - You two beat it! Come on, I said beat it! (dramatic music) - I hit him? (dramatic music) Hey Willie, little guy made you wet your pants! (laughing) - It's payback time, kid. I don't know how you did it, but this time, I'm gonna make you real sorry. (dramatic music) (mysterious music) (water gurgling) - Betty? It's Sonia. Forgot my keys again. - Sorry. - What else is new. So how was your day today? - It was good. Really busy, but good. - You? - Eh, you know, the usual. Still going out to the movies tonight. - Hi Sonia! - Hi. Hey you! Oh, I missed you! I missed you all day! Still wanna go to the movies? Yeah, okay. Go get a sweater. Chilly outside. - Do you mind if we stay here and watch your TV set while you're gone? - No, fine, whatever you want. - Great, 'cause ours has got all those squiggly lines and it can't see nothing, come on. - There's food in the refrigerator. Help yourself to anything you want. - Don't forget your keys. - Oh no, I'm fine. Hi Mr. Mucci! Merry Christmas! - [Mucci] Hey, merry Christmas, Sonia! ♪ I'm a pirate king ♪ ♪ Teran tera, teran tera ♪ ♪ And a doo da doo da doo ♪ Oh jeez! I don't believe it, I forgot my keys again! Do you believe it? Oh, what the heck. I guess Betty'll still be up after the show. ♪ Teran tera, teran tera ♪ You ready? ♪ For I'm a pirate king ♪ ♪ Teran tera, teran tera ♪ - [Man On Television] Is he gonna show up? - [Man On Television] He'll show. - [Man On Television] The kid's a weasel. What the hell's he gonna do? (knocking) - I know, I know, you forgot your key again, right? (wood crackling) (shrieking) (dramatic music) (whimpering) - Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy! - [Computer] Entity has no knowledge of anti-life equation. - Must be the Culmator. Run the test! - [Computer] Discorporation. Warning, warning. - Run the test. - [Computer] Warning. (glass shattering) - Whoa! - Run! (intense music) (electricity crackling) (grunting) - You think there is good and bad? There's only power. (grunting) Soon, I will have power beyond imagination. I could kill you now, but I will let you live so you can see everything you care about be destroyed. (groaning) (dramatic music) - Oh my God. (dramatic music) - [Computer] Your initial wound is now closed. Surface street will provide. I have taken sterilization procedures. - You have to leave. The authorities will arrive soon. - Hold it. Hold it right there. Tommy, get in your bedroom right now. Five years. I have lived with this thing that is so unbelievable that the only people I could tell are my parents. When I tell them, they disown me. I don't even know the name of whatever it was that impregnated me. You'd think one of you space guys or whatever it is you are could've dropped me a note or something. You know, just to let me know that I'm not crazy, that this thing really did happen. Oh no, that would be too much. You're probably too busy off saving the universe, right? Do you ever think about what I'm going through? Or how difficult it is making ends meet? Do you have any idea how much a two bedroom house costs? You know I just feel like I oughta. Ow, ow, ow! Ow! What have you got in there, steel? - Plasteel, to be correct. We really must leave. - Why should I trust you. - If I had wanted to hurt you, I could've done it years ago. You know that. We must go now. - [Computer] Birthing members of the dominant species are highly protective of their offspring. Find the mother and you will find the child. Abraxas is concentrating on his wound. I cannot locate him. His shield is intact. - Hey you, it's closed! Can't you read or what? (dramatic music) - I'm looking for a man, a woman. - Women, ah, you're looking for women. Like exotic dancers? - I'm not familiar with the term, exotic dancer. - [Computer] Exotic dancers are birthing members of the species performing contemporary fertility rites. - What the hell was that? - That's my answer box. - Hey listen, pal, ain't no exotic dancers here in these parts, not in this town, anyways. - Shame. Thank you. - Hey hey, watch it! (groans) Hey bub, that's my car! (grunting) - Tommy has entered an unconscious resting state. - No he hasn't, he's asleep. - [Abraxas] What is our destination? - [Sonia] We're going to Maxie's. - [Abraxas] Is Maxie a man? - [Sonia] Yes. - [Abraxas] Is this man a friend of yours. - A good friend. He grows organic apples, which I buy from him. - Is he a mating partner of yours? - No, he's a good friend, but he's certainly not a mating partner. - I understand. A non-conjugal relationship with a male member of your species. - Yeah, that's what I said. - [Computer] Command issues a reminder that you are to terminate. - What did you do that for? - So that we can talk uninterrupted. - [Dar] It appears that Abraxas has shut down his answer box. - [Hite] That's three times he's failed to apprehend Secundus in a direct confrontation situation. Abraxas may be a little too aged for this assignment. He's had possession of the Culmator for 147 parsecs and still hasn't terminated-- - Parsecs are not an appropriate time unit. - Send somebody else down. - I can't send somebody else down. We're still experiencing warp malfunction in that sector, Hite. - [Hite] When it's back on audio, let me know. - Alright now, Jack, what did he look like. Can you tell me what he looked like? - He was big and then he had a beard. - Did he say anything to you? - He was going to give me a test. - What kind of a test? - That I knew something. - What could a kid like you possibly know that this guy wants? - His wrist was talking! - Maybe the blood samples'll tell us something. Scrape some off the walls and have them queried down at the city. Get a fax report back in about an hour. (dramatic music) - And they all lived happily ever after. Goodnight angel. - Who's this Abraxas character? What do you know about this guy? - I know more than I believe. - Hello. I suppose you're not tired. Wanna sit up here with me. I'll tell you a story. It's about two men, partners. Police men. No, I'd say more like peace men. That's a person who tries to solve things peacefully. That's a very hard thing to do. - Sheriff, I can't eat this. It's nothing but white bread, processed cheese, and non-organic lettuce, just pesticide and water. - Oh for chrissakes, lighten up, would you White? You fall in love with a fruity broad, and no you're trying to get to her by eating all the shit in the store. - Never get involved with a suspect. - [Sharp] She's not a suspect! - What were those guys doing tearing up her place, huh? I think this thing is bigger than it seems. I think it's gonna blow up in our faces. I think we need outside help. - With what? I got one guy responsible for two counts of auto theft and three murders. I can't even be sure the same guy did all three. We got fingerprints and then eyewitness identification. What more do you want? - It ain't enough to be bringing the National Guard, the CIA, the grand jury, and god knows who else. Boehs, you put this on my tab, would you? Come on. - 10. - But one of the men began to grow unhappy. He was seeing so much, learning so much. He thought he found a way to become all-powerful. Soon, the only thing that mattered to him was himself and the power that he wanted. He was no longer a good man. - Tommy? You should be in bed. Go now. How are you feeling? - Healing rate is a control factor that one can manipulate at will. I am feeling better, much better, thank you. - Maybe you can manipulate it at will, but I sure can't. - You haven't tried. - Water helps. It's a great healer. - Well, I'm gonna take a shower. I'll let you know what happens. - You never married after Tommy's birth. - No. Are you married? - No, people in my profession are not allowed. - Yes. Is Tommy gonna be alright? - The anti-life equation could lie dormant in his mind for his entire life, or it could be triggered off. - What's triggered off? - Overloading his mind with fear and confusion. That's what Secundus will try to do. If he gets to the boy-- - But you won't let that happen. - We won't let that happen. (upbeat rock music) (crowd chattering) - There any women here? - Are you crazy, what do you think you're looking at? - Yes. ♪ I'm gonna be crying. ♪ ♪ Well you're leaving me ♪ - Hey buddy, don't touch the dancers. (grunting) (tense music) (beeping) - [Computer] Vocal mode has resumed. Sensors indicate that you have lied and that you have had direct contact with the Culmator child on a one to one basis. You have had ample opportunities to terminate the Culmator, cleanly and efficiently. Command-- - Do you like functioning in the vocal mode? Vocal mode is necessary to serve and protect you, Abraxas. - You will speak when spoken to, or I will deactivate your vocal mode. - [Computer] Command has issued an order to terminate the Culmator child. - You are not to speak unless spoken to. The problem is not the child, it is Secundus. (peaceful music) - [Computer] I am reading your emotion level to Sonia, the birthing member of the species in undressed state. Need I remind you that finders are not permitted to be bonded so that they might remain totally loyal to their task. - Need I remind you that you're only to speak when spoken to? - The two sets of print found in the apartment match those in the vital statistics, but there's something weird. - What do you mean, weird? - Well they have highly irregular patterns, like nothing we have on record. - What about the blood on the wall at the murder joint? - You believe in extraterrestrials? - Ah, spies, CIA, now ETs? Look, I believe I saw what I saw. More than that, I'll figure out as we go. Now what about the blood? - The blood doesn't read as human. - Great, what's it read as, goat? - Chemical composition is like nothing the big city boys have ever scene before. Doesn't match up with any blood type they've ever heard of. Animal or human. - That's crazy! - Alright, so who do you think these guys are, shriners? (peaceful music) (clears throat) - I brought you a shirt. I wanna ask you something. - Yes? - Just before I gave birth to Tommy, you were gonna kill me. You had orders to kill me. Why didn't you? - You had done no wrong. You were an innocent, and you were brave. I could not kill you. - It's your section. - No it's not. - Yes it is. - No, it's not. He's in the mid-section, that's common territory, and besides, there's been murders in this town, and that guy looks like he could've done it. - Any guy who just killed three people would not be sitting in here eating his breakfast. - Well I'm not gonna go serve him. You go ahead. (people chattering) (clears throat) - I'm hungry. - Here's the menu. - This I cannot eat. - You just pick something. - Very good, I will have that. - What'd he order? - He ordered the whole breakfast section. - Did you check to see if he had money first? - You ask him. (dramatic music) - No way, uh uh. - [Sharp] So, what are you doing for Christmas? - [Johnny] Well, I was gonna go home and see my parents, but they don't like me very much. [Sharp] Sure they do! - Anyways, I gotta lot of work to catch up on around here. I'm gonna stay in town. Clean my guns or something. - Why don't you come to our place? Family dinner. - What are you having? - Turkey. - Freerange? - I paid for it. (dramatic music) - [Johnny] So what makes you think these guys are saying at Maxie's? - [Sharp] I drove past light not, car was parked outside. (horn honking) - Get in the other room. The less people that know you're here, the better. (knocking) - Morning. - Morning. - Sheriff Sharp, and I'm Deputy Way. - John, I see you almost every day in my store. What are you introducing yourself for? - Your apartment was vandalized last night and we have reason to believe that the man who did it is also responsible for several killings in this area. We're concerned for your safety. - I'll be alright. - I'm not asking if you'll be alright. Talking murder here. The killer may be after you. - [Johnny] Look, Ms. Murray-- - You're being pretty formal here, John. - We believe that you know something. Now maybe you're protecting somebody, I don't know, but whatever it is, we can help you. You can't do this alone. - I'm not doing it alone, and you wouldn't believe me anyway. - Why don't you try us? - Ms. Murray, you're in danger. I can protect you. We can protect you. Talk to me. Us. - Let me think about it. - Come on, guys, I'll see you out to your car. - We have to get out of here. - Running would just further disturb Tommy. I'm sure he's been affected by the turmoil already. And Secundus would just track you down. We'll take care of this right here. - [Sonia] How? - By taking care of Secundus. - How are you gonna do that? - I've done it before, I'll do it again. - Yeah. - I'll take care of it. - (sighs) Thank you. - That was pleasant. - [Computer] That was physical contact against an area of the human anatomy pressure sensitive, self-moistening, and located close to the perceived source of thoughts and emotions. - You answer box sounds a little jealous. - [Computer] I am free from the bondage of emotion and do not suffer petty jealousies. - Remember what I told you? - [Computer] Sorry. - Haven't you ever kissed a woman before? - No. - You're kidding. - No. - That, good, that was really good. - [Computer] Abraxas. - You've spoken too. - [Computer] I thought you should know that the Culmator child called Tommy has left this domicile. (dramatic music) - Dear Mom, I love you and Maxie and I think Abraxas, too. Bad man is after me. I don't want anything bad to happen to you. I'm going away so he won't find me and you'll be alright. I love you. - We must find him. If he wanders too far, my answer box cannot cloak him. - Will there be anything else? - Those children, where are they going? - To the school up the street. - Do all the children from around here go to the same school? - Yeah, it's the only one in the area. - I see. - What is this? - The bill. - Did I order this? - Everyone gets one. - Merry Christmas. - [Computer] Culmator still cloaked by Abraxas, but cloak weakening. (engine humming) (dramatic music) - [Johnny] Hey that's him! - Hey! - Freeze! - On the ground, pal, now! - Now! - We mean it. (metal clattering) - My DNA is altered. - What are you talking about? - My flesh can handle your weapons. - Well try this one. (gun firing) (electricity crackling) (intense music) (dramatic music) (screaming) - Oh! - Interesting. (gun firing) (explosion roaring) (dramatic music) Interesting, but not effective. (tense music) (dramatic music) - Are you alright, Tommy? - You had us scared to death. - I wanna talk to Tommy alone. Perhaps I could drive back to Maxie's house in your car with Tommy. - Is that okay with you, Tommy? - Okay. - [Computer] Culmator not within. - I know that, I have other plans. (dramatic music) (children laughing) - Different languages, different religions, different colors of skin. But basically, when it comes right down to it, we're all just people, aren't we? (dramatic music) And that's what's really important. Can I help you? - Bring me the Culmator. - What? - I said, bring me the Culmator, or I will kill all these children, one at a time. (dramatic music) I love children. - Your mother told me you have a birthday coming up. You'll be six. I have a birthday soon. I'll be 11,862 next Tuesday. That's a little bit more than six, isn't it? (sighing) I know why you won't speak, Tommy. You're afraid, afraid of what you have inside you, afraid of your power, and I know it's hard being different from all the other children. Sometimes life can be hard. Sometimes we all have to do things we don't want to. - He'll do it now. He was just exercising compassion for the mother. He didn't want to do it in front of her. - He wants Secundus, Hite. - No, no, he'll do it. - I agree, but he'll do it his way. - He can't do it his way, he can't take Secundus out. He knows what's necessary. He'll do it when the child is relaxed and unsuspecting, make it a peaceful death. - You're a good person, Tommy. You could learn to control your power. You can speak. (dramatic music) - Come on, everybody, get back there. Let the men work, come on, get back there. Come on, clear the street, okay, bring it on in. - Tell me I'm dreaming. - Well, if it ain't the mystery cop. - I know the location of the perpetrator. (dramatic music) (glass shattering) - What's going on, Blake? - Some lunatic burst into the classroom, grabbed me, and says he want (stammers) Culmator? - It's him. - Send me the Culmator. I want him now. You have 30 seconds, or I kill the children. - Why are you doing this? What do you want? - [Johnny] He's gonna start killing them. They're just kids! - Send in the Culmator, the child called Tommy. - Tommy, Tommy. - Five seconds left. - Tommy! - [Johnny] Sonia, stop! - Tommy! Tommy! (dramatic music) - I knew you would come. You were born for this moment. You are my creation. You will reveal the anti-life equation. You are my son. You are the Culmator. Just the Culmator. (dramatic music) (grunting) - Tommy, run! Run! (grunting) (metal clanging) - Not this time. - [Computer] Culmator escaping. Culmator escaping. Culmator escaping. Culmator escaping. (dramatic music) (tense music) - [Abraxas] I knew what Secundus was going to do, play cat and mouse with the boy, tease him until fear and frustration had Tommy's mind bubbling like a pot of Sargacian oil. - [Sonia] Abraxas wait, I'm coming with you! - The Culmator's energy is building. He's now capable of causing spontaneous combustion. - How long before he hits critical mass? - Very soon. (tense electronic music) (electricity crackling) - There's no more hiding, no more running. ♪ Look in my eyes ♪ ♪ See me as I really am ♪ - Just you, me, and the anti-life equation. (sparks crackling) ♪ Show me how it feels without ♪ ♪ The ocean pressures go away ♪ (fire crackling) ♪ Save me ♪ ♪ You're breaking me ♪ (explosion crackling) ♪ Strong as I am ♪ ♪ There's something about this thing that scares me ♪ ♪ Strong as I am ♪ ♪ There's something about this thing that scares me ♪ ♪ Strong as I am ♪ ♪ There's something about this thing that harms me ♪ ♪ Strong as I am ♪ ♪ There's something about this thing that harms me ♪ ♪ You have me near you ♪ ♪ Your great uprising while you run ♪ ♪ Ooh yes ♪ ♪ It be you ♪ ♪ You have me near you ♪ ♪ The love you would not share ♪ ♪ This time I'm waiting ♪ (fire crackling) - You're my son. You are the Culmator. (dramatic music) You cannot change destiny. - Secundus! - It's out of your control, Abraxas. You cannot kill Sonia's son, and you cannot kill me. I was a finder, a good finder. Remember the mandate? No finder, past or present, can be executed. Go back home, Abraxas. (tense music) (electricity crackling) (explosions roaring) (dramatic music) - [Abraxas] I didn't know whether Tommy was gonna blast me off the face of the planet or offer me a hand up. - Tommy. - [Abraxas] It could go either way. - Tommy. Tommy. Tommy. Tommy. It's gonna be alright. It's gonna be alright. It's gonna be alright, Tommy. Alright. (peaceful music) (dramatic music) (siren blaring) (groaning) It's stuck! - Freeze! (gun firing) (grunting) (intense music) (grunting) - [Computer] Abraxas, your mandate does not allow you to terminate another finder, let him go. (grunting) - Dead end. - You can't kill me. I was a finder. - Test for the anti-life equation. - [Computer] Warning, testing will result in discorporation. Testing will result in discorporation. Testing will result in discorporation. (explosion roaring) (sirens blaring) (men chattering) - [Man] Get in the trucks, come on, let's move it. Get the hoses out of there. Burning like a cylinder. Come on, boys. We can save this old wreck. Come on, get in there, okay, okay. - [Computer] Your mission is completed. Command congratulates you. A travel warp will appear in two minutes to transport you to your next assignment. - It's possible someone else may try to exploit the Culmator. - [Computer] If that occurs, it will be dealt with then, Abraxas. - It might be wise if Tommy were assigned a permanent finder. - [Computer] Command says your recommendation will be considered. Prepare for travel, Abraxas. - I would be very interested in taking that assignment. - [Computer] Command says your desire will be considered. Now prepare for travel. - I cannot leave. - [Computer] To refuse a transport order means to forfeit your finderhood. - I know. Can I keep my answer box? - [Computer] I would be pleased to stay and watch over you, Sonia, and Tommy, if Command permits it. - We have a decision to make. - The decision has already been made. I was wrong about Abraxas. - [Computer] Affirmative, we can stay. (peaceful music) - Hey! You got some explaining to do. - You're a good man, officer Sharp. This world needs good men. - You really are some kind of offworld cop, aren't you? - I'm terrestrial now. - How am I gonna write this up in a report? - I think you should scale it down to acceptable proportions. - Fine. - You know, I think I'm gonna like living here. This planet's got a great deal of potential. (engine humming) - I kinda like that guy. Mm, let's go. - Coffee and donuts? - Yeah. - [Abraxas] Secundus was zapped off into the universe, and I was on Earth for good. Earth, nice name, isn't it. - [Sonia] I'm really glad you're staying. - [Tommy] Me too. (calm pop music) (tense electronic music) (peaceful music)
