She's coming by plane, not bus! - I know that, sir. I'm not at a bus-stop, but an airport. There she is! For the attention of all passengers traveling on Air India Boeing 707.. Welcome to Paris. - What? Your slave, your driver, ma'am. Sardar Makhan Singh. - You've got it all wrong. How? I have your telegram here. Read it. But this is not mine. Then this garland too, is not yours, sister! Sorry. Greetings, Deepa. - You? - Damodar Dayal. I'm your manager. My Parisian Uncle? - Yes. This way. Wait. I'm your employer, right? - Yes. If you be so formal with me again.. ..I'll fire you! Call me by my first name, please. She's 'Madam' just to me! Who's he? - Your driver. - Sardar Makhan Singh. Please sit in the car. I'll first collect the luggage. Come. - Come. - Porter. Come, child. This is the best locality in Paris.. ..and I've leased it especially for you. And what about you? - I've a small flat near the office. Please come in. She's Honey. She studies in this city. - Hello. I thought if she stays with you as a companion, it'll be an added asset. She are most welcome. - Thank you. Now, if you don't need me my dear.. ..I've to attend an important meeting. - Sure. Child, see that Deepa feels comfortable. - Do you need to tell me that? I'll see you in the morning. - Ok! - Good night! - Good night! Come. I'm really very tired. So I'd like to bathe. Where's the bathroom? Right there in front. Towel, hot-water, everything is ready. - Good. The driver will be here with the luggage. Just get my dressing-gown out. It's right on top. - Ok. Will you drink anything? - Coffee please. - Thank you. Hello! Please send two coffees. Ok? Madam, your luggage. - Just keep it there. What's this I'm seeing? A dream? - What? Beautiful. Simply beautiful! You just can't be real. What? - You are real! - Shut up. Honey. - Coming. Honey. The name's so sweet! Like an Indian sweet. What? Did you say something? I want to. For the first time.. ..I have realized hate at first sight! - Fool. - I think you like me. Honey! - Coming. - Honey. - What happened? Come on up! When I opened the door, do you know what I saw? Someone was peeping? - No! Look down below. This is very common. - Like this, on the road? There's romance everywhere here. France is Romance. Really? - Of course. Paris is famous for it. The one who hasn't loved in Paris.. ..hasn't loved at all! But one has to seek love. - In Paris? No. Here, love itself seeks you. Honey, I always dream.. ..which always remains unfinished. - Concerning love? Yes. Not of unreal love, but true love. You mean you have no "boy-friend"? Of course I have! Loads of them. Then what? - And many love too. But not me! My wealth. I've stopped believing in lovers. I hate. But nobody knows you here. You can move around as an ordinary, poor girl here. And the one who'll love me.. ..knowing I'm poor, will be a true lover. Isn't it? - What an idea! Honey, you are a darling. Keep these safely. I'll ask for them, when I need them. I'll keep them in the office-safe. Oh! And listen. From today, I'm very poor. This is her flat and I'm her servant. - What? If anybody asks about me, please furnish this information. But.. It's a secret, uncle, which will not be revealed to you. Top secret. You may go now. - Yes? Of course. Honey, Makhan Singh is very late. I'm here, ma'am. Had to look into every corner of the city.. ..to procure this garb of an Indian servant-girl. Good. I'll just try this on. - Ok. Listen, sweet-heart. Why don't you also try something? What? - I mean, my love for you. I'm willing to try everything. Shut up! Or you'll lose your job. Oh! I'm willing, even to lose my life for you! I'll prove it. See what I've got for you. Lipstick. - Yes. Now put this on your lips, yourself. That's like it. Had I known earlier.. ..that you'd love me so much, after just one such cracker.. ..I'd have bought of dozen of them! You fraud! Rogue! How dare you! I'll crack you now. Just see. - What are you doing? Leave me. I think she likes me more now. Hello, daddy! - Shekhar! What's this? Daddy, when did you start this trade of jewelry? - Keep it back. Real diamonds and pearls! - They belong to our madam. Madam? - Yes. Deepa. She's in Paris as a tourist. Really. Daddy, I'll show her everything around here. Just introduce me to her. Never! You're not worthy of it. And hadn't I barred you from here? Necessity brought me here. - What? - I need 200,000 rupees. What! - Yes. I've to repay a loan. For your booze and gambling? - It's a question of my life and death! I've nothing to do with it. But you have with me! I'm your only son. That relation ended, when I came to know about your ill-doings. Please, daddy. You'll have to help me. You've so much wealth. That all belongs to Deepa's father. I'm just a manager. Daddy, I'll lose my life! Shekhar, I've no sympathy for a gambler and a boozer, you can go now. Ok, daddy. Where to look? Oh, oh. Who's this? - Dear! What are you looking at? I'm here. What are you doing here? I had sent you to find Deepa. - You are right. I went up the Eiffel Tower to see her. I saw you instead, so I came down. - Idiot. But where did she go? - Shall I tell you? She has gone in search of true love. Mademoiselle! Venice has come back to life. Oh! Delicious. The smile of Mona Lisa. Are you from China? No. From India. India? Delhi! Taj Mahal! Himalayas! I am French. - I cannot speak French. Oh I can speak a little bit of English and a little bit of Hindi. Hindi? - Ok. Yes. One Indian boy is my friend. Ok? - How wonderful. What's your name? Name? - Name. Louis. Ok. I'm Deepa. Oh Deepa. Beautiful. Married? Boy-friend? Love. A beautiful girl, not married and without love. How come? The thing is Indian men demand wealth, for marriage. Wealth? - Money. Franc. - No money. No love. No. They are all greedy for money. Bouquet? Flowers? - No! I mean they're liars. I do not understand? Please say it in English. Liars. Cheat. - No, no, no. I am Frenchman. True lover. Ok? - What? You're beautiful. I'm your love. Ok? I'm very poor. What? - I'm very poor. No money. - Even I am poor.. ..I am an orphan. Ok? You're not married? I will marry you. - And I better leave you! Leave? But come tomorrow. - Okay. I will too. Bye. Deepa. Deepa. Deepa. Deepa. Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! - Hey Louis. Hey you photographer. Where were you all these days? I want an Indian garb. Hurry. What do you want? - Clothes. I want to be an Indian king. Indian king? You're alright, aren't you? I am not. I learnt Hindi from you and I met a beautiful Indian girl. Ok? I'm in love. - What's her name? Deepa. I saw her. My heart fell in love and now I'll marry her. Ok? Marriage! Can't she find any Indian man? Indian men are greedy for money. Who says so? - She did. All liars and cheat. Ok? Who's this impertinent girl? What? - Nothing. When will she meet you again? Tomorrow morning. - Tomorrow. I'll set her straight, you just wait! Sam, I want to be like an Indian King. - Ok. Let's go. Mademoiselle. Are you happy? Who are you? Indian King. Indian girl. Both of us will marry. Ok? Excuse me. Mademoiselle. Ok. Are all these your children? Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! I am not your father! I am not your father! Get out. - Papa. I am not their father! I am not your father! I am not. I am not their father. Get off! Sam. Sam. Sam. - Papa. Excuse me! Madam. Excuse me! Are you alright? Yes, thank you very much. Are you a policeman? No. I am a Frenchman. - Oh Frenchmen! Madam. Just because of one bad French guy, you think all are bad. You said you were French. - Of course. I live here in France. But you speak Hindi. - Like a native. I was in India for 20 years. Have you come from Lucknow? - No, from Delhi. - Oh I see! My father was a Professor of French in Lucknow. Ok. - What's your good name? - Deepa. - A sweet name. So are you of course. Come to see Paris, eh? Yes. I mean no. I'm here with my madam. I'm just a poor servant. Strange! When I was there, the servants didn't speak English. Never mind. It makes no difference. We're all equal here. To prove it, we must have coffee. - No, I must go. Before you leave it's vital that I do something for you. - Why? To remove that doubt from your mind, about Frenchmen being cads. First experience was certainly that. So have a second one! What did she say? She said only the lucky get a beautiful wife. What? - Don't let it trouble you. She thought me married, when I'm not. In fact, I haven't found a girl, who's not greedy for wealth. What do you mean? - Don't mind, but generally, girls are very selfish. It's the men who are like that! I know it very well. Maybe, but you don't know the Frenchmen. Anything special about them? - Yes. They die for their beloveds. Romantic nonsense! They pursue their love till Doomsday! Look here, you better not do that. Why should I? You're a weird girl. You don't even know my name. I've no interest in fools like you! Got it? You want a lift? Please come in. Thank you. Thank you very much. "At least ask your crazy beau his name."

Mr. Shekhar. - How do you do? It's our first meeting, but don't look upon me as a stranger. I give a hand to my father in managing your business. Who gave you all this information? - Not me. There are 2 things which just cannot be hidden. One is "Beauty", and the other, "Wealth". And you are both personified. Pardon me. You seem interesting. Sit down, please. Thanks, but I'm in a hurry now. Are you free tomorrow? - Why? Thought I will get a chance to show you Paris. But we're going on a picnic. I've fixed it with my friends. But I'm no enemy either. - Meaning? - I mean, I could join your friends. Ask her that. - May I? If you wish. - Thank you very much. I'll be here tomorrow morning. Goodbye. - Bye. He seems very shrewd. What do you say? Me? They all are! One and all. Is it a girls party tomorrow, or.. There'll be boys too of course. But they can be got rid of. - Then please do! I hate boys. Move away. Get lost. Leave me. Aren't you ashamed to push me? Come on. Tell us. - Please, tell us. O God! I don't know! I don't know! Not possible. I don't know where the girls are. Shameless lot! Chasing girls? I'll call the police. For God's sake, get lost! - Sir. - Here's another one! Good morning. - Does Deepa live here? - And who are you? I'm Mr. Sam. Just tell her my name. She'll know. So will the world with a bouquet this size. But madam's gone on a picnic. Madam? - Want to meet Deepa? - Yes. - I'm her driver. Sardar Makhan Singh. Driver. Madam? And where's the picnic? Sir, to know that one dozen lover-boys have been pestering me. But I can't tell you. What do you mean? - There are 12 other girls too. And all these are their boy-friends. And the girls have given them the slip and gone. They're fools. Stupid. Those girls can be straightened out. And how? By going to the picnic! Will you join me? My life is among them! - Who? - My Honey. My heart-beats for her! - You love her. I love her, but am scared too. I try to pave the path, but.. But you're not successful. I'll do it for you. Come with me. - Son, you're a savior! Praise the lord! Great, sir. Bull's Eye! Broke the record in first throw! I don't know how did it break? He broke it. This scoundrel is the culprit. Sir. I didn't tell him. He came on his own. - But who is he? The world's greatest magician. Hukku Pasha. The glow on your face, a worldly grace, and your name.. Deepa. - You are great. You're lying! He's a con man! - And who are you? Six of club! He is a cheat. You fool! Shut up! Shekhar, don't take him on. He'll turn you into a dog! Shut up. I don't believe in all that. - But, I do! You seem an expert. Can you read my mind? Take a card son. - Ok. - A Jack of Hearts. But whose heart? At whose feet this falls, you belong to her. What's all this? - Jack of Hearts! Hats off to you, sir. Makhan Singh. - Sorry. They spoilt the whole picnic. Let us go elsewhere. I'll get the bus. Ha! Ha! Ha! He'll return soon. - All the tyres are flat! All the four. Look. - What's this? 12 Boyfriends. 12 girls have given the slip to 12 boys, and come here. Can you tell where those boys are now? Why tell? I'll present them right now! - Nonsense. This girl disbelieves me? Here, hold this. - It is heavy. Don't go. A dozen Juliet's have gone. With their Romeo's. Who is your lover? Nobody! - Liar! Your lover is before you. What did you say? - The truth. Mr. Sam. - At your service. - Fine! Wonderful! But from your weird-ways I should've known.. True lover is he who meets his lady-love.. ..wherever, whenever possible and in whatever form. So that's him, is it? - Can't you make out? Hats off to your magic, sir. You changed your get-up too. - So you knew who he was! Honestly, madam. I still don't know him. No need either. She knows me. And it's between us alone. What a pain! Makhan Singh. Will we find a pump here? Petrol pump. - No! An air-pump. Some nut has deflated all the tyres. It's my magic. But how hill we go back now? The city's so far from here. Makhan Singh, make some arrangements. How? I won't find a horse here! Wait! I'll convince this magician for help. Can you help us? - Yes, I can indeed. Your transport is ready. Come on. Look! Magic! A Miracle! Sir, you are the God of Magicians. Sit, madam Deepa. - I won't ride with him! Then sit with me. Scooter or car, what's the difference? I'm your driver, anyway. Come on, sit. Where will I sit? - With him. He's like your brother. What'll happen to me? - Whatever God wills. Darling, drive slow. I am frightened. Please. "We'll meet again tomorrow, you'll realise tomorrow."

I mean what do you think of Mr. Sam? An impertinent, wild- animal! - Whatever, but he loves you. Else he wouldn't have chased you so. Does "Chasing" mean Love? - Most of the time! Nonsense. Do you mean he'll follow me around? I'm certain of it. - Let's see. Hello. Hello. Uncle? I'm Deepa here. Please hurry. I've some important work with you. Thought of something, uncle. - I am.. I am. If you're not happy in Paris.. - Paris. I don't wish to... ...remain here at all. Then Venice. Rome. Cairo. Uncle, I'm fed up of traveling. I wish to do some work. Then come to the office. It's a business dealing in millions. Business. - Yes. - I don't want to make money. I want to do some good work which will help people. Be an advantage to humanity. What a life I lead! Hold on, dear. Let me think. Airhostess! No. Modeling? No. Switzerland! - Switzerland? - Yes, child. Next week, they're having.. ..an International Youth Festival there. Red Cross Society of every country sent its volunteers there. I know its Director too. You can join the Indian group if you want. It's a good chance, to help people and humanity in general. What a wonderful idea! Please prepare things for my departure tomorrow. I'll get it done by morning. Good night. - Good night. Wonderful! Wonderful! They all are so young. Not one old person in sight. It's meant for the young, idiot. Youth festival. Then let's enjoy! - What? I mean, I'm young, so are you. Shut up! - Ok. But tell me, what's the point of wasting.. ..youth at a Youth Festival? What's the point? There he is. Mr. Sam! - Forget Sam. Hi. - Hi. Thank you for the telegram. But where is she? In the Red-Cross section. And we're in Hotel Belvedere. Ok. Hi, Makhan Singh. See you later. Okay. So now I know! Two-timing is he? Rogue! - What do you mean? He loves Madam and says "See you later" to you! Rogue. - Idiot. I'm helping him. I only informed him that Deepa is here. Anybody here? Is anybody here? I can't see. I am going blind. - Sit down please. Remove your hanky. Let me have a look. Look. You! - Yes. Ever since I've seen this girl, I can't see anything else. I wonder what the disease is. - I know "Shamelessness". Really? Got a remedy for it? Yes. A very patent remedy. I'll just give it to you. Hello. May I speak to the matron please? Hello, matron. I'm Deepa here. Please get the police here fast. You want to make some money? Sure, I do. - Ok, I will give you a dollar. Hit me on the shin. Are you mad or something? - Yeah! I will give you a dollar. Kick me on the shin. Bump. What did you bit me with? Oh, no! Get on with the work. I don't think he'll come again. I'm sure, sister. He will surely come. Help. Help. Help. I'm really hurt! I promise you. I am really hurt. Help. I'm hurt. Mister, stand up! - I can't, madam. I'm very badly hurt. Where? Near your heart? - Nowhere near it! It's my leg. Look. On my shin bone. Is this that man? Yes. But.. Didn't you see this wound? Attend him properly. Thank you! Thank you! - It's all right. It's my duty. You are a sweet heart. Go on, take a good look. And it's your duty remember, to attend to me, take care of me. It's your responsibility. And I am in pain because of it. You really rubbed salt on it! You killed me! It's burning too. It'll be alright. - When? I'm referring to your wound, Mr. Sam. And I'm talking about the pain. But, how will you know about other people's pain? Hi, mister. - Hi! - Do you want another kick? - Excuse me. You bump! Did you have to come now? Hello. You kicked him, didn't you? - Yes, I did. Oh great! I found her! Thank God! So, I found you at last! - Is this a thoroughfare? Had I taken the proper way, you'd have gone away, then.. Then what? Then it would have taken a long time to find you and... ...I would have forgotten what's in my mind. What's on your mind? That's it! This is where I stop. I want to say much, but I can't. My tongue gets slashed, if I try. Honey. Listen. Can you see that? - What? See that little boy there? - Yes. - Englishman's son. Do you know what he'll be when he grows up? What will he do? He'll be a young man, like me. - Really? - Yes. He'll find a girl, like you. - Really? Then they'll both get to know each other.. Better, and even better.. Just like that balloon. - I know what'll happen next. You do? Then tell me. All over just like that balloon! Child! You naughty kid! Couldn't you see me impressing her? Couldn't you blow it a bit more? You burst it at the last moment. Come on. Get lost! Shameless souls. Spoilt all my chances! Hello, Deepa. How come you're here? You've come to heal people and I've come as a patient. Patient? What's your problem? - Well, some illnesses are obvious. And others are well hidden. And it is these that are dangerous. Wish you all the best. Listen. What's your plan for now? I've just come from duty, so I'll rest. Does anyone come here to rest? Have you seen the "Jungfrau"? Jungfrau? - Yes, "The Virgin-girl".. - What do you mean? It's a famous mountain here. Magnificent, and snow-covered. Go and change. I'll take you there. - All right. I'll just come. Come. Come. Let's get down here. Come on, yes. Come. Get up. Watch the rope. Come on. Skiing. - Skiing. No thanks. I can't ski. - I'll teach you. I'm an expert at it. No. I won't even try. A plane? And here? - Why not? I want to go for a joyride. I want to fly. - But it's a private one. I don't care. Make some arrangements. - But.. - Oh please do it. Alright. Wait here. I'll just come. Hi! - Oh god! Not again. - Why not? Isn't there a place on earth where I won't see your face? Yes, there is.. - Where? In your heart. - You know that, don't you? Yes, I know there's no room for me there.. ..but I'll never accept it. Because in school I was taught.. Try and try again. - But you will never succeed. We'll see. "All by yourself."

It's possible. - Your name? - Sam. - I'm Shekhar. How do you do? Have you lost something? - What? It looks as though you're searching something most. And it looks to me as though it is your habit to poke your nose! Only where Deepa is concerned. - Meaning? Keep your distance from her. Why? - Because I'm close to her. You love her? - Very much. Then let's shake hands! I too love her. More than my life. Nobody loves anybody like that.. ..for one's life is precious to every soul. What do you think?

You'll be fine. One brandy please. - A decent Indian girl never drinks. Shekhar, will you please tell him to mind his own business? - Sure. You understand English, don't you? - Yes. Thank you. Here. Bottoms up, like medicine. - But.. - Don't drink, Deepa. Good. Now let's dance. You will feel better. Dance. - I want to say something. Shekhar, let's go on dance. - Come on. Sir, are you seeing what I'm seeing? How did this fool get so close to Madam? Oh Gods! What's he making her drink? Shekar. Leave me. You're hurting me. Shekhar, whose room is this? - My.. Yours. How wonderful! Shekhar, may I sit? How sweet! You can even lie-down. Thank you. Shekhar, call Honey from my room. Please. - Honey. Sure, sure. Why not? Shekhar. Hurry up! I'm so sleepy. Oh God! He drank straight from the bottle! Direct, without soda. - Really? Now he's un-buttoning his jacket. - What about Deepa? Knock out. She's lying on the bed. I'll narrate you the further details. Over. Come with me. - Where? - Come. - Tell me. I was awaiting this for days on end. From today, you'll be mine forever. Yes? Who is it? - Your nemesis! What? If you wish to live, then come down to the Reception at once! Jaggu? You and here? As if you didn't know! But I had said I'd give you the rest of the money.. ..after a month. Where's Jack? Here only. - Here? Listen. Get him out from here. I'll pay you 5,000 rupees. Ten thousand. - Ok. Done. But keep Jack away for me. So scared? - Just shut up. You know your boss will shoot me for the slightest of reasons! Okay. Hold on. It's something fishy and dangerous. O God! What does he say? Okay, boss. Shekhar. Come down right now. Down. - Those are the boss's order. We'll wait just 3 minutes. And if I don't? Then we'll have to come up! Got it? Don't! You wait there. I'll just come. Hurry up. Deepa. - Oh God! What has that rogue done? Deepa. Deepa. Deepa. Let me sleep. Deepa. Get up and stand. Wake up. Do you love me, Mr. Sam? You love me, Sam. - O God! She agreed. Sunny. Let's leave before he returns. You go ahead. I've some other plan. You don't know. He's very dangerous. - Forget it! If he's a snake, I'm a mongoose! You take her. I'll fix him and come. - Ok. - Careful. Yes, sir? - Where are they? I beg your pardon. - Somebody phoned me from here. I haven't seen anytime. - Where you here all the time? Of course, sir. I am on duty. - All right. Thank you. Deepa. Deepa. Wake up, Deepa. I think she should be taken to her own room. I think she's better off here. So that when she wakes, she'll know what all happened. Go to sleep. I'll be awake. Jaggu, you! Boss. Hello, Jack. How do you do? Where's the money? - I said I'd give after a month. How? - By marrying. What? - Yes, A millionaire's daughter. Very soon too. Joking, eh? - No, really! Believe me. Where is she? - In this hotel. - I want to see her. Very well. But from a distance. I'm very ashamed for whatever happened last night. And ever grateful, for all that you did. I won't be able to face you. So I'm going away. Very far, by coming closer to you. You'll get this after I leave. Goodbye, Sam. Here she comes. Hurry up! - Suzy. Jaggu, how come Suzy is here? - Beyond me! Hi, Baby! - What? - Suzy darling. Let's go. Impossible. Jaggu. She's not Suzy! Suzy? Who's she? - A dancer at my Casino. Ladies and gentlemen. We shall now present to you the most fashionable.. ..item of the day. Miss Suzy, the oriental dancer. "My name is Suzy." "Take away my heart." "Into your world." "I have been saving my heart for you since so long." "Take away my heart." "Into your world." "I have been saving my heart for you since so long." "Why are you sitting so far away?"

How come you are here? - I came to see you. - Fantastic. I'd have never believed had I not seen it myself! After seeing Suzy here, I can swear that girl wasn't her. Which girl? - Darling, I saw a girl in Geneva. She looked just like you. Impossible. There's but one Suzy in this world. And she's yours. Thank you, darling. She can never be anybody else's. Go and change and wait for me. That's my girl. - Ok. Who is that other girl? Deepa. My dad's boss's kid. - Mr. Malik's daughter? You know him? - No. But I know he's very rich. Oh I see. She's an only child? - Yes. And you want to marry her to swindle her money. Naturally. - You fool. Where is Deepa now? - Beirut. Jaggu, what's the ransom to return a millionaire's daughter alive? 1 million dollars! - Good. Go to Beirut at once. You know what to do. Ok, boss. - Wait! What's your plan? Nothing. We'll kidnap her and make a deal with her rich father! Got it? Honey. Makhan Singh driver hasn't come as yet. Yes. He can't be seen anywhere. I am here, ma'am. - Fixed a speed-boat for us? No. It's a law. Those who can't Water-Ski, cannot hire a speed-boat. If you can't hire, buy one! Sister, you don't understand. To go into the sea, you need the Club's permission. And that can be got if there's an instructor with us. Then go find one! - Right, madam! Deepa, why this adamancy? The speed-boat goes so fast! I'm in need of speed. The faster the better. So fast, that I leave everyone behind. And go ahead, far away. Just to forget Mr. Sam? You're very strange! You sought true love. And when you found Sam, you want to leave him behind! Hello, we want an instructor. Instructor. Not a Police Inspector.. ..but an Instructor to teach Water-Skiing. Hurry up. In five minutes. Ok? Waiter, get a glass of sweet butter-milk. Such speed of speed-boat! No. I can't do it. - Coward! Deepa. Deepa. Good luck. We have an Indian Instructor here. Mr. Sen. Are you from Calcutta? - No. But you? I am Dipak Sen, swimming champion. - Pleased to meet you. Really? Thank you. Very pleased to meet you. - Thank you. Mr. Sen, how long does it take to learn Water-Skiing? With an expert like me to teach, just one hour! Oh! One hour. I'll go get the board in a minute. Remove this. Remove it. Wow! Lovely! Very beautiful. Very fine figure. Very fine figure. A slim waist. Mr. Sen. - Can't be coy with an Instructor. I see everything, face, figure, heart and mind. Do you love someone? - What? I mean, those in love, can't ski. They have the lover's face swimming.. ..in front of their eyes 24 hours! Shut up! Get lost from here! - You get angry. It means something is amiss in your love affair. I won't teach you swimming, but a lesson. A lesson in Love! Mr. Sam. Come closer. Come along, ladies. Take it closer. O darling! Look at me once. "An angel has come from the sky to teach a lesson of love." "I carry a picture of my beloved in my heart." "I've brought it to show you." "An angel has come from the sky to teach a lesson of love." "I carry a picture of my beloved in my heart." "I've brought it to show you." "Say you love me. - Get lost!" "Say you love me. - Get lost!" "Learn how to love from me." "Concede today that you love me." "Learn how to love from me." "Concede today that you love me." "An angel has come from the sky to teach a lesson of love." "I carry a picture of my beloved in my heart." "I've brought it to show you." "Say you love me." "Get lost!" - Say you love me. Get lost!" "O my darling, for you, I gave up the moon." "I have brought my love as a gift for you." "O my darling, for you, I gave up the moon." "I have brought my love as a gift for you." "An angel has come from the sky to teach a lesson of love." "I carry a picture of my beloved in my heart." "I've brought it to show you." "Say you love me." "You silly. - Say you love me. Don't be silly" "I am your shadow, I will follow you everywhere." "I am your lover, I will enclose you in my arms.. ..and take you away" "I am your shadow, I will follow you everywhere." "I am your lover, I will enclose you in my arms.. ..and take you away." "An angel has come from the sky to teach a lesson of love." "I carry a picture of my beloved in my heart." "I've brought it to show you." "Say you love me. - What?" "Say you love me. - Yes." "Say you love me. - Yes." "Say you love me. - Yes, yes." "Say you love me. - I said I do." "Say you love me. - Yes, I do." "Say you love me. - Yes." "Say you love me. - Yes, I do" What are you looking up for? Those two have flown off. And taught us a lesson. A girl who can't be convinced, should be kidnapped! Makhan Singh, let's go home. I won't stop today. I have my girl, and a boat at hand. There's hope in my heart and turmoil in my mind. Come on, get going. Makhan Singh. - Come on. Move. What are you doing, Makhan Singh? - Nothing. Today I am in the mood. Great! Keep going. Keep going. That was fun. Fun. Come on, Honey. The weather's funny.. Why did you bring me in this scary place? Scary. I was dreaming to bring you here since I was kid! Peace and quiet all around. Here nobody will slap me. Just you and me. Lost in love. Serene. Hey you, idiot! - Who is it? Where's that other girl? - What's it to you? Are you her uncle? Makhan Singh. He has a gun. A toy one! With boogey-bullets. I will get rid of him. Get lost! Where's that stone? Makhan Singh. Makhan Singh. What happened? What happened, Makhan Singh? Is that gun real? Then go ahead and shoot, but not us, okay? - Makhan Singh. What are you doing? - Shoot! What are you doing? Have you gone mad or something? He fired one shot and, you fell into my arms. If he fires a dozen I'll hit the Jackpot! - Makhan Singh. What's all this? Tell us, where we'll find her. Hurry up or I'll shoot. Paris. - Paris. Remove this gun from my head and go to Paris instead. Did you see that? - Let's go from here. What's there to feel shy about? It's a common practice here. A boy meets girl. They fall in love. He proposes to her and gives a ring. And then.. What do you say? The boy proposes, gives the girl a ring and then.. Yah! I am sorry. I am sorry. Miss. Deepa, Deepa darling. Deepu! Will you marry me? - I don't mind. - I don't mind. What a favor you have done one me! Well, see what I've brought specially for you. Now how about that? No. - Why not? I'm an Indian girl, and as per our Indian customs.. ..that comes after marriage. So we must marry soon. Never mind. But till then.. I'm very tired! - Already? We've still to see many things. Roam the streets all through the night. Why? Here people don't sleep. They roam, dance and make merry. And what do you want to do? What your heart desires. - My heart? The heart belongs to you now. And my heart? - That I won't tell you! But I will. I will scream to the whole world. What will you say? "My heart belongs to you." "Your heart belongs to me." "My heart belongs to you."

"Since we have exchanged hearts, the whole world has changed." Hello. - Hello. Come in. Recognized me? - Yes, that day with Jack.. I couldn't say anything in front of Jack. - What? Something to your advantage. - What? Property worth million. Say is again. Millions, which we both could get. - You mean me too? Sit down. - Thank you. You look just like that girl. - I've heard. Jack is going to kidnap her. - I know that too. And then you will take her place. I don't know about that. He didn't tell me anything about it. He doesn't know any of this. This is my plan. No. I dare not defy Jack. I dare not either. We've lived all our life, fearing him. We danced to his tune. You like it? No. But there's no other way out. Join me and we'll become millionaire within a week! The moment we get that money.. ..we will be free from Jack's clutches. We'll go far from his reach. There's risk, only till we get the money. Then, we can buy it! What's my share? - 50 percent. How much cash? - At least 1 million dollars. If you need time to think.. - I've done it. I'm with you! Look, that's Deepa. She's exactly like me. A carbon-copy! Study her carefully. Even her own dad, must not know the difference. He won't! Deepa. Shekhar, stop. No need to tail any further. Have you noticed her walk, her way of talking, etecetra? Are you sure? - Yes, I am sure. Deepa. Deepa. How childish! What's this about? - Leave me alone! What's wrong? - You don't know? Why so much interest in that girl? Got offended over a small thing? - Small thing? Of course. I just lit her cigarette. Putting your face so close to hers? Looking deeply into her eyes? So, you get jealous too! Only those who love, get jealous. But I didn't get jealous when you.. ..tried to flaunt Shekhar at me! Sam. Please don't remind me of him. I want to forget him. And what do you want to remember? This. I found true love in this, which I sought. For which I traveled from India. And has it ended now? No. It's just begun. A journey of love. With your own beloved. "Companions of the night.." ".. seek a sojourn." "Far away at the horizon.." "..emanates the radiance of love." "So enchanting is your beauty.." ".. that it mesmerises.." ".. even the heavens." "Our laughter will rouse those in slumber." "We ought to subdue our feelings tonight." "Sleep evades us this night." "Sleep evades us this night." "But someone lulls us to sleep." "Companions of the night.." ".. seek a sojourn." "Far away at the horizon.." "..emanates the radiance of love." "So enchanting is your beauty.." ".. that it mesmerises.." ".. even the heavens." "So intoxicating is this romantic night." "Let's surrender to this passionate night." "Let's forever be in this reverie." "Companions of the night.." ".. seek a sojourn." "Far away at the horizon.." "..emanates the radiance of love." "So enchanting is your beauty.." ".. that it mesmerises.." ".. even the heavens." "Innumerable vows.. a legion promises." "Our tryst with love begins." "Love is a mystery." "Love is a mystery." "But yet the mystery unravels soon." "Companions of the night.." ".. seek a sojourn." "Far away at the horizon.." "..emanates the radiance of love.." "..emanates the radiance of love.." "..emanates the radiance of love." Tired? Sleepy? No. This Paris is strange place. No one knows when the sun rises or sets. Or when one finds love. Do you know what the locals do when they fall in love? What? - They have the French Onion soup! What do you thought? Have it. - Deepa. You fooled me and courted her. I'm angry with you. You're no more my Indian friend. Indian friend? - Yes. Liar and cheat! He's Frenchman. I am Frenchman. He's Indian. - What does it mean? He's lying! - I'm lying? You are! Look at his passport. Go on. Shyam Kumar. Market place. Lucknow. India. Shyam Kumar alias Mr. Mr. Sam. Pretending to be Frenchman. Liar. Cheat. Betrayer. - Yes. How did I betray you? By making a fool out of me! - Of course not. In fact I proved that Indian men can love sincerely. Shut up! I don't wish to see your face ever again! But you love me, don't you? - Let me go! Louis. You fool! I could mince you. With her out of the way, you are Deepa from today. Till her father comes here, nobody must suspect a thing. Nobody will. I'm only scared of Mr. Sam. Sam? He's blind. - Blind? With love, you can easily fool him. And now you're quite familiar with Deepa and her behavior. - Shekhar. You're alright, my dear? - Of course. But why the police? Somebody phoned to at the office to say that .. ..some Jack has kidnapped you! And that for your safe return he wants 1 million dollars! Only that much? - Quit joking, dear. The police know that Jack is the most dangerous and notorious criminal. Nobody has harmed me yet, so, their presence is not required.. You are right. It's was false news. Even then we must be alert. I was scared. Had something happened.. ..how would I have faced your father? Uncle, don't worry. Just go now. Good night! - Good night, dear. - Good night. Wonderful, Suzy. If you could fool my dad.. ..then Deepa's dad will be easily duped. Now we will surely become rich! - But there's still time. Just a few days. I'll go now. It's not wise for me to be here. If I need to, I'll phone you. Good night! - Good night. Who is it? - Shyam. Alias Mr. Sam, alias the magician, alias Deepak Sen. That is me! Hello, Sam. This is for me. How lovely! Lovely! That means no get out? - Get out? I thought you'd rant and rave. Then I'd console and convince you. What for? - You're really not angry with me? Can I ever be angry with you? - Then what happened last night? Last night? Forget it! Bygones are bygones. Deepa, didn't you ever doubt that I was an Indian? No. - Know why I posed as a Frenchman? To do away with your wrong notion that Indian men can't be true lovers. I have no such misconceptions! After meeting you. You're well, I hope. - What do you think? I'm scared to think! You never came so near to me. Sit down. Sam. Won't you take me out? - Sure. I'll take you out. Ok. I'll just get ready. Who had been here? - Nobody. Then who has been smoking cigarette? Cigarette? Uncle was here yesterday. Yesterday? It is still burning. Really? I meant he was here just before you came. Why have we stopped here? - To see Louis in his dark-room. Louis. - Louis. Oh yes, Louis. Funny, last night you got cross due to him. And now you behave as if he's a stranger to you. I don't like him at all. Let's change the topic. Let's talk about us. You've changed a lot in a day. How? There's too much of a difference in you today. - Yes! And you're responsible for it! Me? - I love you more than I ever did. Why? - Because I got angry and you got that huge bouquet. Is that all? I thought it was about the engagement ring.. - Engagement ring? Where's it? - Sorry, Sam. I threw it away in a fit of temper. Good! Yesterday it was given by Mr. Sam. Today, Shyam will replace it! Now don't lose it, okay? Remember what I had said yesterday? Yes. But I wish to hear it again. Just that a boy meets a girl. They fall in love. He proposes and they get engaged. And then.. - Yes? I had got far as this only.. Didn't you say I changed a lot since the last 24 hrs? Deepa. - Let's bridge that gap today.. Let's let the sky and earth become one. What's wrong? - We're Indians. We keep all this till we wed. I am sorry, Sam. Come, let's go. Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Damodar. - Sir, you? Greetings. - Greetings. Deepa wasn't at home, so I came here. But why so unexpectedly in Paris? - Unexpectedly? But you wired me? Wired you? No, I didn't. - You didn't. Then who did? I did. - Hello, Shekhar. So you wired me. - Yes, by using Daddy's name. - Shekhar. Your presence was very necessary for something important. - What for? I wish to marry your daughter. What? - We love each other and Deepa's willing. That's impossible. - Then ask her yourself. I will. I can't believe that she has decided to marry. - What? Damodar. I was at my wit's end convincing her. She never liked any boy. But if she wants to marry your son, I'm very happy. Sir, he is my son no doubt, but he's not suitable.. It can't be better than this. Damodar, you managed everything till now. Now your son will takeover. Go and phone her. See if she's home. Mustn't waste time. - But why hurry things? Tomorrow morning.. Tomorrow morning? Who knows? She may change her mind. Damodar, you don't know her. I'll call her here. - Yes, do that. Hurry. Anne, get some coffee for the boss. - Right. Hello. - Who's that, Suzy? - Who? Who's speaking? - Honey. Sorry. Wrong number. Come. Hi, Honey. When did you come? - Just now. What is it? You look so happy. Hey, what's this? - That's an engagement ring. Thanks to you, ma'am. - Why me? You left us behind in Beirut.. ..and our love blossomed even more. Congratulations. - Thank you. Where's sir? By the way, sir. We are engaged now. What about you? Makhan, I have some work for you. Deepa, I'll just come. Hurry back. Let's have a party for their engagement. - Sure. Honey, I won't be long. Do you know the Manager's office? Yes. - Take me there. - But what's wrong? - Come. I think her phone's not working. I'll go and get her myself. Sit. I'll get it. Damodar Dayal. - Speaking. This is our last call. If you refuse 1 million dollars.. ..Deepa will be killed by evening. Kill her! Hello. Hello. He says kill her! What? Something fishy there! You go to Paris at once and phone me. Okay, boss. Shekhar. Shekhar. Is your father in the office? - Yes. Why? Don't ask. Deepa.. - Makhan Singh. Let's go to the office. Come. Sorry. What! - Mr. Malik, the girl in your flat is not Deepa! But she's exactly like her. As though she's her twin. Combined sister. Twin sister? Hadn't I not known Deepa well, I'd have been hoodwinked too. Damodar, is it possible that Rupa may still be alive? Rupa. Who's Rupa? Deepa's twin sister. 20 years ago, after my wife died.. ..I had come to Europe with my twin girls. I found an Indian to look after them. But at that time, I didn't know that he was full of vices. One evening.. Jaggu, where were you the whole day? - I was held by. You've been drinking. - A little. I've kept you here to take care of my kids.. ..not to roam around, understand? Don't use that tone with me, sir. This is Europe, not India! Hot temper could prove very dangerous here. You threaten me? Get out! - Pay me off then. Right now. Get out. Boss. This will cost you very heavily. That very night both of my girls were asleep.. I couldn't sleep, so I was reading.. Suddenly, I heard a shriek.. Daddy. Daddy. Jaggu, stop! Jaggu, stop, I say. Jaggu, Jaggu. I saved Deepa, but I could never trace Rupa and that Jaggu. Wait! I've heard that name before. In Switzerland, when you had phoned Mr. Shekhar. Yes, manager. Where's your son? My son? - Yes. - I don't know. Why? He knows a criminal by that name. Are you sure? - Yes, Mr. Malik. And his Boss's name is Jack. Jack? - Yes. - That's the guy who had threatened me! Jaggu, Rupa.. After so many years! What's all this about? I am surprised myself, sir. If that girl in the flat is not Deepa.. Then she's Rupa! Nobody else. God has saved her for me. And only she knows Deepa's whereabouts! Yes. We'll go and see her now. - Yes, let's go. - Come. Hello. Yes? Who? - This is Deepa. - Suzy. Come down by the fire-escape, now! Why? I will tell you later. Get out quickly. - But.. Makhan Singh, wait here. Call me later on. Hello, Sam. Hello, Deepa. Know him? My father. He wanted to see you before you got married. Greetings. Rupa. Rupa? My name's Deepa. The pretender! Because he's real Deepa's father, Mr. Malik! But you just said.. I wanted to expose you. Then who am I? - My lost daughter, Rupa. Deepa's twin. Excuse me. But I think you're mistaken. Mother, father, siblings, they mean nothing to me. I have no relative. I'm all alone. No! You can't be anybody, but Rupa. Why not? My name is Suzy. I'm famous in all the night clubs in Europe. Night club? What do you do there? I dance, I sing and earn money! - No! Why not! That's my profession. Want to know anything else? Yes. Why did you pretended to be Deepa? Sam, I wish to speak to you alone. Where's Deepa? - I don't know. Damodar, call the police at once! - Sir? You're right. I must be mistaken. My daughter can't be a cabaret dancer! Have her arrested, Shyam! You want to see Deepa alive? - You know where she is? Yes, I do, And if you want to know it too, come with me. Don't inform the police, till I return. Why have you brought me here? Because all the roads meet here. - It'll be easier for you to choose. - Meaning? Meaning? Come, I'll show you. Before meeting you.. ..I spent my life dancing and singing.. Exhibiting my young body, to the lusty looks of the public. But after I met you, I realised life had a different meaning. What are you getting at? I've fallen in love with you. And you know I love Deepa. - And you want her to live too! - Where is she? Only I know that. And you want a price for giving that information, eh? - Naturally! Tell me the amount. How much do you want? Only your love. Sam, I love you. Make me yours. I promise Deepa will be returned to him, safely. You're not his daughter? He's a stranger to me! I never saw him or lived with him. You've no pity for your own sister? No! I never knew her as that. And after knowing it, you're still.. .. making a deal for her life? For love. I want to start a new life, with your love as a support. I want to be yours. You're not worthy of it. Why not? In what way do we differ? In many ways! Had she been here, she'd have died for her sister. You are as different as "Real" and "artificial" are! As "Day" and "Night" is! A "Decent" and "Indecent" is! Tell me.. her whereabouts. Now! If you change your mind, come to my hotel. Tell me! Goodbye, Sam. If you want her to live, you'll have to pay for her life! If you want her to live, you'll have to pay for her life! If you want her to live, you'll have to pay for her life! If you want her to live, you'll have to pay for her life! If you change your mind come to my hotel. If you change your mind come to my hotel. If you change your mind come to my hotel. If you change your mind come to my hotel. "I'm obliged, you've come O My beloved!" "Pause for a moment.." "..listen to the saga of my love." "I'm obliged, you've come O My beloved!" "I can't express my feelings." "This is in your honour, please be seated." "What's the hurry?" "It was a long journey." "Savor the moments of pleasure." "I'm obliged, you've come O My beloved!" "You've come.. I'm obliged." "I can sacrifice everything for you" "For once, look at me." "That's my only desire." "I'm obliged, you've come O My beloved!" "Pause for a moment.." "..listen to the saga of my love." "I'm obliged, you've come O My beloved!" Come. I knew you'd come. Wait. I'll just change and come. Sit down. Drink! - No thank you. - No, Ok. Cheers. What have you decided? To marry you. - Without a condition? - You know it already. Unzip me, will you? I want you to promise, that she'll reach her father safely. Is that all you want from me? That's why I love you so much. You expect nothing from me! You wanted to be mine. I'm willing. Nothing more. No Sam, thank you. I wanted your love. Not pity. You'll hold me in your arms.. and harbour her in your heart. I'll be aware my whole life that you obliged me! Suzi.. - No thank you, Sam. I may be bad and cheap.. But certainly not so fallen,.. ..as to sell my emotions under a pretensions marriage! You may leave. Goodbye, Sam. I'm sorry, I couldn't convince Suzy.. ..to part with Deepa's whereabouts. I told you to inform the police. - Deepa would've been in peril. She's in danger even now. I wonder how she is. Where she is? I can part with my entire wealth to get her back safely. I'm for their every condition. I'm willing to pay any amount they wish. Only 10 lakh dollars! Who are you? Don't you know me? Your old, faithful servant.. You're still alive! Yes. And so is your daughter. I wish she wasn't. What I've seen of her.. Whom have you seen? Rupa. Who now calls herself "Suzy." - Where did you meet her? - In Deepa's flat. I understand. You rascal! Tell me where Deepa is! Else I'll have you arrested. You've already lost one daughter. Want to lose the other one too? - Do you know where Deepa is? - Yes I do. If you don't give Jack the amount by tomorrow evening.. ..you'll find her dead! - Will we have the money by tomorrow? - Yes. Wait! What proof do you have that she's in your clutches? Here it is. It's her handwriting. Now; where and who do we give it to? Carrying a black suitcase, one man alone.. At exactly 5-00 p.m. should reach.. ..the Niagara Falls' Tower, tomorrow. - And after that? - You'll know the rest there itself. Goodbye. Now, where's Deepa? Go on, tell me! Enough. He's out cold. We better hand him to the police. Book a ticket for Niagara tomorrow for me. You won't be able to handle them; It's not your.. better I go instead. Let you go? How can that be? My daughter's life is at stake! And she's my life itself! Matchbox? No, I've got a lighter. Coming from where? In Paris. Okay. Follow me. Come, dear. Look. Isn't she your duplicate? It's like looking into a mirror. Okay, I'll go now. Expecting some calls. Don't cry. - Who are you? - Your twin-sister. - But I don't have any sister. - You don't know it. Even I didn't know. But your father told me. - Daddy? When? - In Paris. I met him, for the first time. But he refused to accept me as his kid. Why? Because I'm as bad, as you are good! We're different as "Day and Night". - Mr. Sam was absolutely correct. - You know him? I knew him.. for a few days. Anyway, forget it and quickly change.. ..into my clothes and run from here. And you? Don't worry about me. You're in danger. Shall I risk my sister's life, and save myself? - No, I won't go. - Go; don't argue now. No, I won't go. Don't do that. Don't sacrifice your love for my sake. I'm not worthy of it. I'm part of this gang. What! You too will come to hate me now like the rest of them. But give me a hug before you leave. I'll never get this chance again. Come on. Dear Sis.. When you'll meet Mr. Sam, just tell him this on my behalf. Darkness is found only where there is nobody to show light. That way please, sir. Thank you. Please, go inside. Please, come in. He's here, boss. Shekhar! You! Mr. Malik has sent me. With 10 lakh dollars! Sent you? To take her back. Really? Her father trusts a hoodlum like you. He's even willing to make me his son-in-law. You've conned her father too, eh? You've always taken me to be a fool! Forced me to dance to your tune. And now you've become smart, eh? Yes. Okay, Smarty. Keep the case here. Call Deepa here first. I can forcefully take it. But you won't, because it is a deal. You want the amount, and I, Deepa. You really have become smart. I'm really scared of you. Okay. Get Deepa. Yes, boss. Suzy darling. Come. - See her. - Absolutely like me. You've met Suzy? Yes. Hello. Hello. You carry on. I'll just take a walk. Okay. Just tell someone to see me out. Sure, my dear. Thank you, Jack. What? Hold on. Keep an eye on him and hold on. Who's the other guy? What other guy? The one who's with a black bag awaiting at the tower? Could be anyone. How do I know? - Open the case. - Don't believe, eh? In our business, we don't trust even our own fathers. Nor yourselves! Hurry up! Is that man, still there? Send him in the fall's tunnel. Have you got a matchbox? No, I have a lighter. - Coming from where? Paris. - Ok, go inside. Thank you. Shekhar? You dare make any noise. Come with me. Stop it! Or I'll shoot you! This is your old boyfriend! He was always putting hurdles in my way. Today I've got him! Run, Mr. Sam. Run. I'm not Deepa, but Suzy. Believe me, please. I've freed Deepa. She's awaiting you at Jack's den. Run away from here.. - What's happened? - Suzy's hurt.. How? - Shekhar shot her. She's out there and I'm going after him. - Don't worry. I'll get the police. - Hurry!
