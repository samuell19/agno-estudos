This film is fictional but inspired by real events. Any stance on a legal case is unintentional. ATHENS - Coffee? - Yes, please. Not too much. What time were you up? Eight. - Want some? - Yes, please. Working long hours, you must be tired. Be right back. Wrong floor. Situation secured. Send up the Frenchman. Abdelhamid Abaaoud. Take a good look. Ahmed? Where is he? You know him? I know nothing about him. Where is he? Maybe on the roof. We lost him. Nothing. SDAT3, Athens. 0948 hours. Abaaoud exfiltration op terminated. Failed. Ten months later Yes? Yup? TN750 to all units, gunfire in the 10th precinct. I repeat, gunfire in the 10th precinct. Turn it around. Yes, Marco? Two bombs at the game? I know. Héloïse is with the PP. Sit tight, call everyone in. Gunfire in the 10th? The streets. Give me street names. Bichat, Fontaine au Roi. So, 10th and 11th. Two men in cars, shooting into the crowd. Hold the line. Casualties? Heavy in Paris. TN81 for BAC10, on the scene. - We need backup. - Heavy weaponry. Request backup. It's a war zone! I repeat... Assault rifle wounds. Rue de Charonne. Send backup. Sub-Directorate Anti-Terrorism. Don't worry, I'll send a team over. Surveillance units, initial briefing Room M. Number of shooters unknown. One group at the game, one in Paris. Gunfire, Rue Bichat. Fontaine au Roi, TBC. And Rue de Charonne. Séverine, Stade de France with your unit! Sébastien, 10th precinct! Terrorists at Le Bataclan. During a gig. In the face of terror, France must stand strong. Hold on, Marco, they went from sidewalk bars to Le Bataclan? How many of them? How many? Casualties? Call you back. Fred, RAID and BRI units are ready to go at Le Bataclan. Any estimate on casualties? No precise numbers. At least 30 in Paris. Too early to know at Le Bataclan. Bring up ongoing targets. Everyone's on their way. We have, at my request, mobilized all available forces to enable the neutralization of the terrorists and to secure every district that may be affected. I have further decided to seal the nation's borders. Intervention canceled at Les Halles. False alarm! No, false alarm. So, where we at? Fontaine au Roi, they're searching the basements. My dear compatriots, my thoughts are with the victims. There are so many of them, and their families and the wounded. Several dozen gunshots have been fired. It's sheer horror. I need timings. - Talk. - Call you back. Two groups, maybe three. One at Stade de France, the other in the 10th, attacking Le Bataclan right now. They left one guy here. So Bichat to Nation, then back to Le Bataclan? We're checking the timing. Coordinating emergency services? One unit. Flooded with calls. When the 197 number's up, it'll be a fucking tsunami. Assault on Bataclan is go! At this very moment, our security forces have launched an assault at a venue in Paris. I have called for military reinforcements to prevent further attacks. My dear compatriots... At the Ministry, call you back. I ask you to maintain complete confidence in what we can do with our security forces to protect our nation from terrorist attack. We have a casualty count? Nothing reliable. We're waiting on info from the hospitals. We have confirmation, though, that the Bataclan terrorists are not those that attacked the bars. - So some are on the loose? - Exactly. But seeing as we have no idea how many are on the loose, nor if other cells are about to act, like Coulibaly in January, so I recommend a citywide lockdown until the situation is under control. We will not give in to panic. It's not giving in to panic. The President will declare a state of emergency. All services must be back up. Info coming in. Provisional casualty count in the 11th precinct suggests 60-80 dead in Le Bataclan. At least. The death toll keeps climbing. Could be linked to Athens. Most likely, I guess. Sure, but I won't be home while they're on the loose. Give the kids my love. I'll call. We have at least 100 dead in Paris. It's a massacre. Emergency services treat victims, firefighters evacuate folks, and law enforcement is securing the city. Naturally, we train for this, but if the emotional burden is too much, stand down. You will not be judged. If you know a victim or think you might, go home or work in the field. I don't want personal emotions taking over. Marco's group leads Investigation, under my command, with the group led by Stéphanie, who supervises procedure. Sarah will head up Surveillance, working on orders from Investigation. Cyber will be led by Julien and Mélanie. Divide up Infiltration and Network Monitoring. Track and report all messages of support for IS, okay? Lastly, Margaux's group handles Victims. Identification, hospitalization locations... Latest news is, two maybe three terrorists on the loose in Paris. 1:17 am. They dropped off the radar at 10 last night. They're 3 hours ahead of us. We'll define areas where they may be. And we lock down Paris and its suburbs. I want informers, undercover operatives and cops to be coordinated. Any guy acting weird in the last 24 hours must be in custody. And I want us all focused on our jobs. Like every day. Thank you. NOVEMBER NOVEMBER 14 We found the shooters' car. A black Seat. That one there. There... they're leaving Rue de Charonne. Then they turn onto Boulevard Voltaire. One of them gets out. So only two in the car now. All right. And then? The car sets off again. We pick it up here, at Nation. Hold on. What? We're sure of that? Next time we pick it up is here. On Rue d'Avron. After Rue d'Avron, done, we lose them. All right, so eastern suburbs. Check tapes in Vincennes, Saint-Mandé, Montreuil and Bagnolet. Sir... The PTS found an ID card in the car outside Le Bataclan. Name of Salah Abdeslam. - French? - Belgian. From Molenbeek. Associate of Abaaoud. Yes, and you'll like this even less... He made it back to Belgium last night with two other men. Salah Abdeslam, 26, born in Brussels, is currently on the run. He rented in his own name both cars used in last night's attacks. One was found outside Le Bataclan. The other, a black Seat, was used by the two terrorists who attacked bars, armed with Kalashnikovs, and are also on the run. Salah Abdeslam was seen this morning at the Belgian border, with two other men... There's no trace of Abdeslam traveling to Syria. Belgian Intelligence says Abdeslam is a boyhood friend of Abaaoud, so he could easily oversee operations from Belgium or Paris under orders from Abaaoud. Is Abaaoud definitely in Syria? Almost certainly. After the Athens washout, he got to Raqqah via Bulgaria. We have no sign of him since. Pres goes on TV at 8 tonight. What's SDAT got for us? All my units are on it, following multiple leads, We've racked up 214 searches, 37 people in custody. Fine. And the DGSI? We have something. Omar Alaoui, trafficker, jailbird, on our watchlist, radicalized in prison in the 2000s by Djamel Bouzihad. That's him. Changed SIM card 3 times in 2 weeks, 3 trips to Belgium since October, doing all he can to escape surveillance. - Sent you the file of one Omar Alaoui. - Got it. DGSI will send you his SIM details. - Get Surveillance on it. - Copy. - Kader, from DGSI. - What you got on Alaoui? He may be linked to the terrorists. Looking for a black Seat fleeing the scene. - Sarah, an important Surv request. - We're on it. Djibril, Foued, a Surv op for you. Omar Alaoui, 35, Rue du faubourg Saint-Denis. Come on, Omar. Come on, kiddo. Got him. We're active. 0930. Alaoui in transit, exiting a black Smart, registration Bravo Max 5-4-7 India Echo. There we go. Good job, man. Here, look at that. - Still no sign of the black Seat? - None. Still in custody? Okay, thanks. Write it up. It's insane. Those brothers have gone straight to paradise. Back home, I'd be in the streets celebrating with my brothers. Mashallah. I won't talk on the phone. Are you home tonight? Sure, what can I do? The parcel I gave you 3 days ago, we need to talk about it. But on the phone, it's hairy. - I'll stop by later. - Whenever you want. - What time? - The usual. Inshallah. Salaam, see you later. Interesting tap on Benkhadra. Seeing a guy named Mokrani tonight. We know any Mokranis? Not me. Me neither. SDAT here, to run a check, after a wiretap in the Benkhadra file, I'm looking for a guy named Mokrani. Benkhadra's everywhere, but nothing on Mokrani so far. Benkhadra never gave up on crime. I'm more on this Mokrani guy. - How come? - Nobody's ever heard of him. Interesting. I put Cyber on it. He's with the Salafists but not really. Great. I'll send it to Surv. Thanks, Inès. BRUSSELS Son of a bitch! Freeze! Down flat! Get down! Down! A terrorist attack, Abdeslam calls you, you jump in your car, you drive 600 clicks in one night, bring him home, and that's "normal"? I didn't say it was normal. Salah's like my brother. He needs me, I'm there, period. Period. Now you've no idea where he is? I told you he got out by the station. - That's all I know. - Yeah, we get it. - He didn't talk? - Sure. He said he was in on the attack. And they're only just beginning. It'll keep going off in Paris. He said he had an explosive vest. We thought he was bullshitting... He gave details? No, that's all he said. What did he say? He'd blow shit up. Know what? Let's put you in custody. I'm innocent. Risk of 2nd attack - I came clean! - We'll heap it on you. - And we'll talk again. - I'm innocent! They're stopping. Pull over. They're getting out. Djibril, hold up. He's going in. He's inside. Go, Djibril. - Can I help you? - Morning. Delivery for Mr. Alaoui. Last door, ground floor. Thank you, sir. 30 minutes! Prep handover to incoming teams. News on Mokrani? Ongoing. Surv will get on it tomorrow AM. That's too late. Benkhadra visits tonight. Look, they're swamped All top priority. Registration CL-995-LI Guns found inside. 3 Kalashnikovs, 6 mags. Empty cartridges and mags too. Papillary and bio analysis ongoing. - Shooting mode? - Full auto. - Numbers intact. - Yup, we'll soon know if they talk. - They were seen getting out? - Door-to-door, nothing so far. That's Croix-de-Chavaux métro? Security cams? Maybe they went that way. We filed a request. - Keep me posted. - Sure. Fred? Surv has tracked Alaoui to Vitry. RAID requested for the arrest. Police! Omar Alaoui! Alaoui, on the floor! Don't move! - Don't move! - Stop! Police! Stop! Show me your hands! Freeze! Get down! 13 kg of coke? Yup. That's why Alaoui dropped off the radar. So not involved in the attacks? Not according to his movements. The DGSI had no way of knowing that? What can I say? What about the Seat in Montreuil? And Abdeslam? Nothing for now. Plants at all strategic locations. Dive bars, underground mosques, prisons... Talk to me. Sir... BRF reports cams at Croix-de-Chavaux show 2 suspects. Tapes in 30 mins. 30 minutes is too long. Marco... Tell BRF to move their asses. Get those tapes in under 15. I agree with other studio guests. We are at war. What does "war" mean here? We knew it might happen and it has happened, only months after the Charlie Hebdo attack, The measures currently being taken are not enough to protect us. We are told that, in recent months and even days, we succeeded in heading off various attacks. From my reading of the press, it was mainly due to the bungling of the terrorists, rather than the security services actually protecting us. Fuck! 2304. Benkhadra arrives at presumed residence of Tarek Mokrani. NOVEMBER NOVEMBER 15 You identified two armed men. Correct? He spoke at one point but I don't remember what he said. I know it's hard but try to remember. He turned to the other guy, he said something... - They were dressed... - One laughed. ...normally. He turned to the other guy and laughed. Young. I briefly caught the eye of one of them. It was like he saw nothing. He saw nothing. All those people they'd killed were nothing. Do you remember any other details? Their clothing? - His sweatshirt. A navy blue hoodie. - Great. Same color as your jacket. How old are you? 23. Was he one of the shooters? No. The only one I saw... tried to shoot me. His gun jammed. So he tried again. It jammed again. I don't know why I'm still alive. He kept firing. I hid behind a table. I only saw their feet. One was wearing orange sneakers. - Orange, you said? - Yes. Flashy orange. After that... Silence. I know, baby. Call me up to be sweet anytime. For sure. I love it. SDAT16 completes walk-by of house believed to be Tarek Mokrani's. It is 1245. Write it up. Yup, Enghien-les-Bains, three days. You and me. - Happy? - Windows are curtained. No suspicious movement inside. Foued, curtain. Move! - Move it! - Three days there... Note movement. North African individual. - Bearded, mid-20s. - Description confirmed. You're breaking up. Stop moving. Camera on. Shit, you're beautiful! Run the Belgian plates through Eucaris. Delattre! Yeah, hold on! Delattre! A group of combatants of the Caliphate, may Allah give it power and victory, targeted the capital of abominations and perversion, which carries the banner of the cross in Europe. Paris! Eight brothers wearing explosive vests and carrying automatic rifles attacked selected targets in the heart of the French capital. Stade de France. Le Bataclan, where hundreds of idolaters celebrated perversity, along with other targets in the 10th, 11th and 18th districts. These attacks killed at least two hundred crusaders. France and its disciples must learn that they are the main targets of Islamic State. This attack heralds the storm. It's a warning to... IS has claimed responsibility for the attacks. Know why I played it to you? To hear your little buddies' voices. When we prove you provided the weapons, we'll inform the Prosecutor. You'll go down for years, not months. Two months here, and I don't get what... It's not about what. - It's about who. - I never sold weapons to those fuckers. Serial numbers on weapons in the terrorists' car match guns you had in your possession. See? Those are yours. Found in the shooters' car in Montreuil. I was happy to chat off the record but you better talk or else... she'll take down all the shit you spout. Go. Sorry, I have nothing to say. I have principles. You have principles? Gun-running to Islamist terrorists is one of them? That explains the pretty cross on your forearm? 130 dead. You hear me? Mothers, fathers, teens... There are kids who woke up yesterday to be told their parents were gone. You got kids? - Got kids or not? - Like you give a shit. Where are they? With your ex? Your mother? Most likely, tomorrow, they'll be taken into care. Rely on me to tell them what you did. I didn't know my buyers. Buyers for what? A year ago, I got... Can't hear you! A year ago, I was contacted to... deposit guns in a container in Charleroi They just told me where the keys were. See? Let's pretend you volunteered the info. The Prosecutor will like that. Your contact? He went by Abu Omar. - Him? - No, don't know him. What else? What the hell else? What do I get out of it? My patience, but not for long. Talk. 2-3 weeks later, I got a call for another delivery in... Near Paris. I've no idea if it's linked. It's all linked. Name? He didn't say. But he was at the transaction. And? I knew him from Fresnes prison. Way back. Khalid Ben Ahmet. I sold to him 'cause he's a damn fairy and I don't give one fuck. - Right. - 130 dead? Don't blame my Kalashnikovs, blame pussy politicians. - You done? - No, I'm not. Friday night, send in the army. Napalm all over the projects. But you won't. Limpdicks! Right, that's all. My cross, take a look and leave it be. This Ben Ahmet guy? How come he slips the net so easily? Our fault. We put a tail on him, and lost him. Sensitive, I know. Sensitive, yes. You realize we can't assign hundreds of agents to our watchlist? Sure, but a guy on the watchlist stockpiling weapons, get all over him. Let's save procedural issues for later and focus on neutralizing the fugitives, as we are... How come we have nothing 3 days in? 3 fucking days, if I may say so. My guys haven't slept since Friday. We haven't slept either. And your point is? Our responsibility to the nation, which you may not grasp... Sorry? ...is to ensure every citizen feels safe. The minister expects results. Find Ben Ahmet! Revisit the Ben Ahmet wiretaps, see what you can turn up. Khalid, it's Mouss. Where you at? You never pick up. The dude in custody, where's his file? The kid from Montargis is coming in with us. He's on the watchlist! It's important. I have a contact for the instruments. Guitars and everything. Khalid? No talking over the phone. - Top priority. - Radicalized, Turkey 2013. Khalid Ben Ahmet? I want that report in 10 minutes, tops. DGSI lost him. And Cyber? Zip. Even in infiltrated Syrian accounts. Nothing. Only the IS communiqué. URGENT Brothers, I need a car. Anyone? Marco, he bought a Mercedes 3 weeks ago. On my way. Put out the model and registration. We issued an appeal for witnesses with his description. - And the car? - Registration sent out to all units. - Meshing? - We're swamped with info. Last night alone, over 500 calls. Tarek Mokrani, at 1345, you are now under arrest for conspiracy to commit terrorist acts. You want a doctor or lawyer? Better. I'll talk to your boss. - As you know... - Okay? We can talk? Get me Martin Bérieux. Hello. I work for you guys. 3 years undercover! 1 day for you to screw it up. - I know. I apologize. - Apologize? Tell it to your kids, stop them ruining our hard work. Martin, dial it down, please. When your house is in order. Calm down, all right? When I put 20 guys on the trail of a coke dealer, do I bawl you out about your service's incompetence? Meaning? Want more? Your undercover informers, 3 years for what information? I'd no idea Mokrani worked for the DGSI. No, the problem is, the DGSI had no idea we'd tracked him down. No C1 warrant, no Surv op, no greenlight from Investigation. And no paper trail! Question is, how did you get the address? Info from an internal source. Truth, please. I tailed him. Tailed who? Benkhadra. Surv couldn't cover his Mokrani meeting, so I tailed him. A state of emergency, a solid lead. I'd no idea he's with DGSI... You think the issue is the DGSI? The issue is our service's efficiency, Inès. You ignored all official procedures. Instead of Mokrani, imagine you arrested Abdeslam. If his lawyer finds out, there's no judicial oversight, know what happens? Do you know what happens? Most likely, he walks free. I obeyed the call of duty. You're not a provincial cop now. We don't do undercover improv. Get it? Obeying "the call of duty" is the worst thing you could do. It gives those guys a possible out. - Sorry, sir. - Damn right. It's the first time. And the last. Back to work. Report in 2 hours on 197 calls. Fucking hell! Okay? Just fine. How many statements to process? We topped 1,250 calls this morning. Khalid is linked to them, too? The Belgian brothers? Khalid, Malik's cousin? Who used to come here? Yes. Ben Ahmet. Apparently, an emir in Syria called him. khalid ben ahmet bagnolet mosque Hello, sir. Sub-Directorate Anti-Terrorism. What can I do for you? I need information on Khalid Ben Ahmet. We know he attended this mosque. And multiple sources link him to Friday night's attacks. Tell me about him. I wish I had information, sir. Khalid was a good boy. In recent months, he turned. He joined brothers who'd gone astray. If I knew where he was, I'd say. But no one's seen him for weeks. Help him, please. I planned to call you. We have a lock on Abaaoud. The minister just called. Mirages are on the way. French air raids on Raqqah, the IS terrorists' stronghold in Syria. Ten fighter-bombers dropped twenty bombs, targeting arms dumps, training camps and command posts. France has not conducted such massive raids since airstrikes started on September 27. The target, Belgian Abdelhamid Abaaoud, is suspected of planning Friday's attacks from Syria. The jihadist made the news in January, when he narrowly escaped arrest in Athens. Abaaoud's death, if confirmed, would be a major blow to IS, since he was increasingly influential among French-speaking jihadists. I did track and field and... One event we did was long jump. Then... we threw... I'll call you back, honey. The Ben Ahmet file. Thanks. Caught on speed camera in Montargis, Friday at 10. So he wasn't in Paris for the attacks. On the 14th, though, he actively sought a hideout. His phone stopped pinging at 11 last night. Good, thanks. I might have something. A girl in Saint-Denis says the two terrorists are laying low under an interchange near Aubervilliers. Dressed like hoboes. Abaaoud and Abdeslam blah blah, then a curious detail. Orange sneakers. So? A casualty mentioned orange sneakers and it never leaked out in the press. She says Abaaoud's cousin is at her place. Hasna Aït Boulhacen. The transcript? Sounds pretty implausible. The sneakers are weird, though. See what we dig up on Boulhacen and the witness's environment. - Evening. Is this Samia Kelhouf? - Yes. Captain Inès Moreau, Sub-Directorate Anti-Terrorism. You called the hotline earlier? What took you so long? I called multiple times. I know where the terrorists are hiding. Please repeat that, ma'am. I know where the two terrorists are. NOVEMBER NOVEMBER 16 Marco, you got a minute? Samia, 30, Saint-Denis resident, no police record. Has Abaaoud's distant cousin staying. Not on our files. Hasna Aït Boulhacen. Samia claims that the two terrorists are hiding under an A86 interchange near Aubervilliers. She saw them. One, in jeans, like a Rom. The other, shaggy, bomber jacket and orange sneakers. Trouble is, she identified two people. Abaaoud for sure, and Abdeslam at first before retracting. Abdeslam's in Belgium and Abaaoud was killed by an air strike. - I know. - Is she just making it about her? 3 witnesses cited the sneakers. It never leaked. She's worth listening to. Bring her in and get her statement. This is BAC26, following a black Mercedes. Vehicle flagged on file. Discreetly shadowing. Plates Bravo Charlie 2-5-4 India Uniform. Single occupant. Awaiting instructions. First shock, then prayer. In a few moments, France will come to a halt for a minute's silence. Citizens will pay tribute to the 130 victims slain... Come here! Freeze! Stop! - Come here! - Police! Stop! Move! Out the way! Stop! Stop! Police! Get out of the car! Get out! Get off me! Okay, I'm clean! - Hands. - Cool it. Khalid Ben Ahmet, You confirm the name or you go by Abu whatever? Jackie Delattre? Ring a bell? Don't know him? This guy. You were in prison together. You bought guns from him. Where were you on November 13? They struck with lightning, right? You're scared. I can tell you're scared. Brothers will slit your throats... Tell us about the two men who attacked the bars. All I can tell you is, the hand that strikes you is not just any hand. It's the hand of Allah and of his prophet, Muhammad. And it's not over. They'll strike you again. My brothers at large will kill you all, one after the other. You, your infidel wives and kids... Fred! Okay, okay. It's okay, guys. Stop that right now! What's gotten into you? Get a grip! If you're gonna lose your cool, you're no use. Go home! Pull yourself together. Think. I need you. Make that asshole talk somehow. Samia Kelhouf? Capt. Moreau. We spoke yesterday on the phone. Follow me. I'll take a look inside your bag. Turn around, arms out wide. Okay, turn back. Sorry, standard procedure. Straight on. This way. You are Samia Kelhouf, born 16th August, 1983, in Epinay-sur-Seine. Nationality, French. You live at 45, Rue Paul Eluard, in Saint-Denis, with Hasna Aït Boulhacen, who has lived with you for 2 months. Go ahead. Okay, so it was 9:30-10 in the evening. In the car, we reached Aubervilliers, the roundabout under the A86, and Hasna was on the phone. I couldn't tell you who was calling but it was from Belgium. How do you know the caller was in Belgium? I saw the number. She said she had to get out to wait for her 14-year-old cousin, who was homeless, living on the streets. We approached the camp entrance. He spotted us right away. He was wearing a black hoodie and orange sneakers. I couldn't help it. I was like, "The attacks, that was you?" He looked me in the eye and said, "Yes." He said, "Yes, I did the bars." Then he said, "We'll keep going. "We'll attack a police station or kindergarten in La Défense." He kept telling Hasna she should help. He needed a place to stay and stuff... We left and went back to the car. On the way, she called people up to find him a place to sleep. And then, we just drove home. That's it. The search of his car, anything? Only his prints. - No traces of explosives? - None. - We're in his phone's photo galleries. - Let's see. Back up. There. Keep going. There. Enlarge that building. More. Stuff came up on you, Ben Ahmet. A trip five years ago. Ring a bell? Fuck you, okay. Fuck you! Is that you in the photo? Look. Look! See that? Took us a while but we figure it's Isfahan. And my right to a private life? Sure, it's very important. We'd be rude to tell your IS buddies about your trip to see the Iranians. Not the Iranians, a girl I know. It's my right... A Shiite? Ouch, not a good look. Shut it, you whore! Listen up, you prick. Tell me who did it and I won't post your Shiite on Facebook. Talk! Good, let it out. I don't know the guys you want. And Delattre's hardware? For my cell. The 13th, I wasn't in Paris. With the attacks, I knew I'd get heat, so I stashed the weapons. - Really? Where? - A forest in the provinces. - Where? - I can find it on a map. You're bullshitting me. It's true. Tell me the truth. The truth! By the prophet Muhammad, I'm telling the truth! As God is my witness. By the life of the prophet. We'll get there. That's him. You're sure? Yes, that's him. He's thinner, his face is gaunt, but that's him. Him? Abaaoud? I'm 100% sure. I saw him under the A86. I'd like to back this up, if I may. Can you tell us why you went there? - What does that change, why I went? - What does it change? You take in Abaaoud's cousin, and 3 days after the attacks, she asks you to visit her cousin, and you go. That doesn't seem strange to you? She said her cousin was 14 years old so... Hasna's practically homeless. I'd no idea she was lying. That I'd run into a psychopath. We made eye contact, in the rearview, when he was saying he'd opened fire on people... The rearview? You said you met outside. We met outside near the camp, then got in my car. - Your car? - Why'd he get in your car? I don't know. - Maybe he was cold or didn't... - Cold? You seriously think I'm lying? Walk us through it again. It's not clear. First you met outside, and then all three of you... Or four of you? - Walked to your car. - Yes. Three or four? - Four? Why four? - The second terrorist. He stayed with the junkies. Keep up! We're trying. You claim that person was Salah Abdeslam. - And he never left the camp. - Sure he did. He came out, I glimpsed him... - From the car or outside? - Outside. You're sure? I was in the car, no... Hold on, I was in the car. - You were in the car? - I was. They were outside. And I saw them when Hasna... That's it, when Hasna got out of the car with her cousin. I saw all three of them talking outside the camp, but I hardly saw them. It was dark. - I didn't get time to see them. - Too bad. You think I'm enjoying this? Do you or not? I don't get where you're going with this. Let's take it from the top. The man you say is Abdelhamid Abaaoud, you heard him ask Hasna to find him a place to lay low? Very clearly. A place to lay low in return for money later. You know if she's found him a place? She hasn't said but I guess. So easily? You took her in because she had nowhere. She called people. - Which people? - I don't know. I know she called people, she asked her family... Her family? Who in her family? Please don't talk to me as if I'm a criminal. I've done nothing wrong. Perhaps. - Is this a joke? - It's very important. You need to be as precise as possible. To clarify why Abaaoud, an IS big wheel, might be sleeping under an expressway. And the only person he can call for help is a loser cousin and her do-gooder friend. I don't know. You don't know much. I'll talk to Fred. You and your team discreetly check out the A86. Inès. Discreetly, nothing more. 1601 hours. Arrival at location given by witness. Rue des Bergeries. Nothing to report. Boss... - Enjoy. - Thanks. Look, the plates. 2016 hours. Car with Belgian plates on Rue des Bergeries. Registration 9 Oscar Uniform Yankee 4-6-2. We're headed back to base. An ideal hideout. Remote, sleazy. A mix of homeless, migrants and junkies. As we were leaving, a car with Belgian tags arrived. We're running checks. Nothing so far. Marco, thoughts? It's fragile. Unlikely even. Samia, the witness, gave us some interesting info that checks out. But I can't put aside the idea it's a trap. Maybe she was manipulated to mislead us. Away from the shooters. We're exhausted, Fred. Frazzled. So... For whatever reason, if she's lying, manipulating or bullshitting us, we're toast. Inès? Your gut feeling? I believe her. Why? I met lots of Samias in the projects. Usually, they duck these issues. She took a huge risk coming here. I think she's telling the truth. But Abaaoud's presumed dead. She took in his distant cousin weeks ago, and claims she talked to him at the hideout. She also mentions orange sneakers, and says Abaaoud plans another strike. - Any intel on the witness? - None. A big blank on the witness, her links to Abaaoud and the cousin. The slenderest of leads. What do you think? I think we can't ignore this witness. - I also think it's dangerous. - We have no choice. We're going for it, Fred. I'll put Investigation on it. And I'll go see the Moroccans. They have Abaaoud's uncle under surveillance. NOVEMBER NOVEMBER 17 Movement. Djibril, headed your way. Foued, to you. Keeping eyes on her. We'll wire up the apartment. Won't take long. - She uses this computer? - It's mine. Yours? She never touches it? - No. - Show me her room? - Please. - Yes, of course. There. Sorry, it's a mess. Don't touch a thing, it tips her off we were here. I don't get why you don't arrest them under the expressway. Why waste time? - All done. - Great, thanks. I've got it from here. For a transaction. From Belgium. MOROCCO Yes, Héloïse? I'm flying to Morocco. Abaaoud's uncle was arrested. He says he'll only talk to French anti-terrorism. I'll keep you posted. Sofia, get on it. It's busy. Go, go, go. Benoit, coming your way. Take over, good job. Sorry, ma'am. Where is she? - Djib, anything? - No sign of her. Got her. It's not her. Fuck it! Kader, Rudy... We've lost her. Could be headed your way. Inès, get down here. We've lost Hasna. Copy. - They lost her. - What? They lost Hasna. Shit. Can I help? No, I've got it. - I'll clear these up. - Please. You read me? Inès? All units, we're screwed. Stop, stop! Fuck it! Shit, shit, shit. Inès, Hasna incoming. Get out now! You hear me? I can't right away. What the fuck's he doing? SDAT6 for SDAT28, Kader approaching. Tell him to back off. Can't. He's without earbuds. Excuse me! Excuse me, sister, just a second. My friend Aziz Melkoum lives here. - But no mailbox. Know him? - I don't. Please, help me. He has my assignment for college... Where was that? Kader's accosted Hasna in the lobby. Get out! - I'll finish up. Go! - Gotta finish. Get the hell out! Don't you get it? No time. Beat it! - I know, I'm sorry... - Get lost, yo! - We good? - Yeah. Go on, go. Get the fuck out! - Don't touch me. - Sorry! I don't have time. I don't know the guy. Piss off! Sarah, we're good. Inès is out. Kader too. Jeez, guys. - Go ahead, commander. - Thanks. Hello. I'm a commander with France's SDAT. Get out of here, you. Shut it. Why should he? I want no Moroccans listening. Talk to me and you'll be fine. - I'll talk when I get guarantees. - No. If you refuse to talk, I get back on the plane. My nephew is still alive. Convince me. I want residency. And immunity. I can't promise it. But if you want, I can help you move to France. Promise me my nephew won't be killed. Your nephew likely died in Syria. No. Tell me everything. Inès? The uncle confirms Abaaoud was in Belgium two weeks ago. They spoke on the phone. It checks out. Must be him under the A86. We need the address of the crib Hasna's found. Pick up contact with Samia. - I'm relying on you. - Copy. Crowds all over the world pay tribute to the victims of the Paris attacks. In London, Trafalgar Square is packed... Meet me in the garbage room. Delete this message. Delete If we go in under the expressway, it's 50-50 they get away. We don't know how many are in there. With backup? Heavy weapons? We'd need to enter the camp to find out, but most likely he'd blow himself up right away, claiming innocent lives. That's why we need that address, Samia. I don't have the address. Arrest Hasna. She knows it. Arresting her shows we're onto them. We lose our advantage. I know it's hard, all you're going through. Help us one more time. You must get that address. It's your job, not mine. It's nothing to do with me. - I know. - So? You need to see this through. It's the only way. Fuck! You're very brave, you can do it. See this through. Hasna? What happens to Hasna? Relax, she's not our target. After, we can help any way you want. We'll be there for you. - You want to help me? - I promise. No names, no links to you. Get me the address, we go in... and all this is history for you. Don't worry, I swear. I swear. Truly. Trust me. We're almost there. Shit. I'll try. I can't guarantee it, I'll try. I'll try to get the address. What's wrong? Nothing. Is it because of me? We have reason to believe another attack is imminent. Evidence is a Western Union transfer by Hasna Aït Boulhacen, supplying a terrorist with money from Belgium. Witness indicates he's armed, at least with an explosive vest, and in the coming hours, he'll strike in La Défense, a police station, or a kindergarten. I'll inform the Elysée. I'll take them to the apartment at 9-10 pm. I have cash for a taxi now. Can't they go alone? They need you? - He's my cousin. - So he's your cousin! Why do you have to go? Why get mixed up in this? I don't get it, Hasna. Don't sleep over. What's the address? I'll pick you up. - You're acting weird. - I'll pick you up. What you blabbing about? You gonna rat me out? Are you for real? You live in my home, remember. I share all I have, you take me to France's most wanted men. I help and trust you, and you doubt me? Get out of my house if you doubt me. Stop crying. I'm gonna die. You're not gonna die. Trust me. You'll have a beautiful life. - You won't die... - What is it you don't get? I'll never have a beautiful life. Don't you get it? - It's pointless. - Stop, please. Trust me. Stop. Calm down. I'll save my cousin. I'll save my cousin. He'll do what he has to do and become a shahid. Inshallah, I'll go to paradise. Hasna, stop it. Stop talking like that. Show me some trust. Just me, trust me. Forgive me, sister. Please forgive me. Hasna, please stop. Stop it. Stop it, come on. You can't ruin your life. If I want you to pick me up, I'll text you. I'll text you. Mouss found the crib. It's 8, Rue du Corbillon in Saint-Denis. All units... Recon at 8, Rue du Corbillon, in Saint-Denis. SDAT95, maintain surveillance of Hasna. Copy. We're on our way. We're good to go. That's the site. Sniper here. Surveillance teams here, here and here. Here, intervention units. Vehicle approaching. - BMW. - Going around the roundabout. What's he doing? There's soliciting. And dealing shit. Yeah, some chatter. Unclear what's going on. Are you able to identify? Negative. There's movement. They're dipping. They're taking off. SDAT52, taxi approaching. Registration Alpha Delta 2-1-9. Delta Oscar. Over. Her phone's pinged. It's her in the cab. Going around the roundabout. Looks like it's stopping. Taxi has stopped. Can't see. Too many people. No sightline. Eyes on two men, wearing down jackets. Possible explosive vests. Clear line of fire. No intervention authorized. Movement. Taxi headed off. Taxi headed off. Let's go. Drone launch authorized. To all units, vehicle is 700 meters from site. Let them enter the apartment. Héloïse? They're in. The two presumed terrorists entered the apartment, accompanied by Hasna Aït Boulhacen. Units are in place. Fine. We have the President's go for intervention. NOVEMBER NOVEMBER 18 Laser 2 and 3 for Laser 1. Maintain element of surprise. No idea what's in the apartment. Explosive load of terrorists' vests is unknown. Arrival imminent. I repeat, arrival imminent. All units, lockdown requested. Lockdown completed. Laser 2, go. Laser 3, action. Police! Fuck, door intact. Back up! Come on in! In the name of Allah, come die with us! Element of surprise gone. Don't let them get near! Risk of explosion acute. Saturation fire to keep them at distance. Stop! Let me out, please! Please, I'm begging you. Let me out! Hands up! Both hands up! I've done nothing wrong. Palms visible, fingers spread. I've done nothing wrong. Let me out, sir! I'm begging you. Where's your boyfriend? He's not my boyfriend! - Where is he? - He's not my boyfriend! Let me out! Show yourself. Please! Laser 1 for Laser 5, we're inside. Situation stable and secured. Nothing left, total destruction. No visual contact with hostile elements, all under the rubble. Send the bomb squad. Entry operation complete. I repeat and confirm, entry operation complete. It's over. Sorry... Get me out of here. Get me out now! I want to get out. Do you understand? You lied. I'm arrested like a criminal. Am I the criminal? No. I give information, get arrested, and you say nothing? I'll talk to them, I promise. Quit promising everything and nothing. You never keep your promises! Fuck! Where's Hasna? Where's Hasna? Is she safe? She's dead. I'm sorry. We tried to let her out but they detonated first. Her cousin killed her. Fucking sorry! I'm sorry, Samia. What happens to me? Me? What happens now? I can't say right now, I don't know. I don't know but we'll... I have no answer. I didn't expect them to arrest you. I don't know. I agree. She shouldn't be there. - Witness protection... - I gave her my word. I know you did but it's the law. I can't change it. We'll try our best. Her case is unique, a first. Informers are given a new identity through a program, but regular citizens, zip. It's outrageous. What you're feeling is only natural. Going back on your word is unfair. It's despicable. Seriously, there's no way. - I promised I'd help her. - Yes but... - You said, go all-in on her. - I know. I kept on her. I told her, we'll help and be there for you. We used her. She really helped us. We can't just say it's the law. - That's irrelevant. - Inès, you did a remarkable job. You can be proud of yourself. No. In five days, we've been through a storm no one could imagine. With a terrible price to pay. We'll never forget the... The victims of that Friday. There'll be a before and after 13th November. After these five days, we'll be better armed... The battle we are waging is remorseless. Unscrupulous. For our compatriots, this investigation is over. For us, it's only just beginning. The 13th November attacks killed 131, injured 494 and caused thousands of victims. The investigation lasted 5 years, involved more than 1,000 investigators, and spanned 4 continents and 25 countries. Salah Abdeslam was arrested on 18th March, 2016, in Belgium. 37 people were arrested in France, 27 in Belgium and 5 in Austria. Samia Khelouf's case set a legal precedent. The law now protects civilians who help fight terrorism. Samia lives under a new identity, protected by the French state. While Samia Khelouf's character wears a veil, this is not representative of her personal beliefs. After a 9-month historical trial, 20 were sentenced, ranging from 2 years to life in prison. Salah Abdeslam was given a life sentence. No defendants have filed an appeal.
