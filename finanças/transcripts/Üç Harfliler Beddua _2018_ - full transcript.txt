Triliterals: The Curse Angel? My child, YOU just screamed? David? Osman-g?zi, Bursa Good Morning. - I think a message's arrived. - Okay, I'll look. George? Why do you put a password at your phone? What do you mean "Why do I put?" I put a password in case it can be put. But I don't. Rose, don't be ridiculous! - From whom the message arrived? - How do I know, from whom... I haven't looked yet. George. - I wondered. - Oh, what's to wonder? Never mind whether that is from whom. - Is she still calling you? - Rose, don't be ridiculous. - Fifty times, we talked about this matter. - Okay. Let's see that's from whom, then. She sent, didn't she? That's from her. That is, yeah! Here you go. Here, what she wrote... May the mercy & blessings of Yahweh be upon you. Have a Holly Friday. (Bekir T?RKCAN) Uncle Bekir. I like you jealous of me, Rose. But don't overdo it. Rose who is needlessly saddened by everything... ...and cries out immediately, is a total foul-weather friend. She is responsible for the money affairs of our class. Because she lent to everyone, her name went up to a banker. Our friend who has managed to keep her soul as clean as a newborn child,... ...opens her heart to all without getting bored... ...and waits no return. Neither words nor time is enough to tell... What we didn't experience on these desks. But all we know is that;... ...You'll never be forgotten... ...with your childish smile, Rose. Misi Village Oh, you, let's see, come. Come, come. Don't be afraid, don't be afraid. Come. Honey. Honey, what are you doing here? Honey. Edith, she is the only animal rights advocate of our class. A cat, a dog, a mouse, a fly doesn't matter for Edith. Edith who is always happy and cheerful,... ...becomes annoying and turns into a monster... ...when an injustice is made to an animal. When she gets a low mark from exams,... ...she grieves for three days and always objects to teacher. For Edith who wants to be a veterinarian in the future,... ...we wish her success in life. We'll miss you so much, Big-hearted girl. R.O.T. GOLDEN SCISSORS. TAILOR'S SHOP FOR MAN & WOMAN. - Here I am, Gloria? - Rose,... ...I don't know if you know, but... ...they fired Angel's father, Uncle David. - I have no idea. When? - I don't know. The other day, I also learned. For your information, I called. You know their situation is even worse. I know, Gloria. I know. Okay, you, hang up. I'll call and talk, then let you know. Goodbye. Gloria who draws attention with her long black hair,... ...is the brunette beauty of our class. She is so fragile, that some of... ...our teachers... ...are afraid to make her take an oral exam, to prevent anything happening to them. Gloria started to work with her father before finishing school. We wish a colorful and radiant life like the dresses she sewed. For Gloria who we believe that she'll be a good fashion designer in the future. Thank you for hopes, dreams and everything... ...that have meaning in your existence, Gloria. Oh, Father, how could you do such a thing... Father, I can't believe you. - Who are you calling? - My father. - Here I am, Daughter? - Hello, Father, how are you? Thanks, Daughter. How are YOU? How's your lesson? Fine, Father. Father, today, my friend Gloria called. You've fired Angel's father, Uncle David. Father, his daughter is sick; she can't talk and can't walk. Don't YOU know that? What do these people do and make now? Already, they have no financial means. Daughter, I have no idea, but. I had to fire 16 people. Father, Angel is my best friend. Do you understand? She's my best friend. Can you say, how can I look at her mother & father's face now? Okay, Daughter. You, don't worry. Father, if you love me, you get Uncle David back to work. - Don't worry, Daughter. - I can't believe you. How could you do something like that, Father? - I'Il take care of it. - Okay. I come home tomorrow evening, then we talk. - See you, honey. - Goodbye. What happened? Forget it! My father's craps, you know! Tell me once. I wondered? Who's Angel? Angel was my high school friend. She was one of my closest 2-3 friends at that time. A bad event happened to her in the last year. She was paralyzed. I'm so sad for her. You never told me that. What else will we learn about you? I didn't tell because I didn't want to remember. We were in high school senior. Some evenings, we would go out of house... ...under the pretext of studying and meet in a derelict house at the entrance of town. The eerie environment of that place, was exciting us. An evening,... ...we agreed to meet there again. When we approach the house, we started to hear screaming noises. What was that sound? At first, we didn't understand what happened. Havel who townspeople... ...called "mad sorcerer",... ...was there. The sorcerer woman called Havel... What is she doing so? We were so scared. We didn't know what to do. We thought she killed Angel. We moved away from there to tell what I saw and to ask for help. When townspeople came at the derelict,... ...they found Angel on the floor, as her hair cut. She was treated at a hospital for months. She was a different person when she came back. Last night, I woke up for a noise. I thought Angel was trying to speak. Last night, I woke up for a noise. I thought Angel was trying to speak. As if she wanted to say something. How do I know... Maybe I dreamed. Even that made me so happy, Carla. Sister Magdalen, you, don't even depress. Angel, our daughter will be okay, Yahweh willing. Angel, our daughter will be okay, Yahweh willing. The problems don't end... Carla. Look, they even fired David. We don't have nothing left... Yahweh knowing... Sister Magdalen, it's too hard. Believe me, I always pray for you all, together with my daughter. Do you know what's the worst part? That the person who did this to her is walking outside. That the person who did this to her is walking outside. May Yahweh chasten her, Damn woman... Here, let's see... Edith. Magdalen said that Angel was trying to speak last night. Oh, what did she say? Come on. She didn't talk like that. But she sounded as if to want to talk. I understand, Mother. Look, I wonder now. I'll go visit her. And I'll take the turtle when I go. Angel likes it. Let her be glad when she saw. Go, Daughter, go, it's a good deed. Did your friend talk to Rose about Angel's father's job? She did, Mother. She did. Let's see, Rose is going to talk to her father, too. Yahweh willing. Shaman means a magician and sorcerer. There are different opinions about the source of the word Shaman. There are those who say that comes from Sanskrit, as well as those who say... ...the word is Manchu or Mongolian. Turkish tribes mostly call the Shamans "Kam." Shamans often do things like prophesying and wicthing and captivating and sacrificing. George? George? George? - Hello, George? - Here I am? - Where are you? - I went out to buy cigarettes. I'll be back soon. Come quickly. I was scared when I couldn't see you. - Okay, I'm coming. I'm home in two minutes. - Okay. Rose? Rose? Rose? It's me, okay, okay, don't be afraid. Okay, okay, it's me. Okay, okay. It's me. Today, a foreman called. He said "Come to the factory tomorrow, I have a good news for you." Come on then, Yahweh willing. I asked, but he didn't say what it is. He said "Sir Vehbi will talk to you." I wonder what to talk about? Honestly, I don't know... Did Angel be fed? I fed her, I fed her. Today, they talked about a man in the coffee shop. A charm... They call him a saint one. They say he heals. Our caf? owner, Saleh took his mother-in-law to him. He says; a woman who couldn't walk for seven years, got up in five minutes. Who was this man? I don't know... Saleh said; "Let me speak once, and then let us take your daughter to him and let him take a look." How many times have we taken her to preachers, David? And let him take a look. They praised the man very much. Maybe it would help. Yahweh willing. I hope nothing's wrong? Welcome, Daughter? Good evening, Aunt Magdalen. Where'd you get that..? I found it in our woodshed. It was looking stupidly, like this. So I thought I should bring Angel it in case she likes. Come, go ahead. - Good evening, Uncle David. - Good evening, Daughter. We were eating. Are you hungry, Daughter? And let's serve you that? No, I'm not hungry. Enjoy your meal. Angel. Look, what I've brought you. You like it. Aunt Magdalen,... ...let us go to the room with Angel,... ...and let us make a private girl-talk? Of course, Daughter. Come, let's see. May Yahweh bless both her daughter and her family. Amen, amen. Amen. Angel. Look, how cute it is. I brought you it in case you like. Come on, come and let's caress it. Angel, can you hear me? Look, if you can hear me, move your finger. Come on. Do you remember me? Did you remember me? Huh? Do you remember me? I'm Edith. Edith. - Sorry for the trouble. - Enjoy your meal, Daughter. Aunt Magdalen. I think Angel understands us. You understand, don't you? You understand, don't you, My beautiful friend? Look, Aunt Magdalen. Angel understands us. Gloria&Michael -- We're pleased to see you-all there with us at our engagement ceremony. Come, Daughter. - Welcome. - Thank you. How's Angel, Daughter? The same. Nothing has changed. I tried to speak, but she doesn't respond at all. I think Aunt Magdalen says "She was trying to speak" because she wants her to heal. So be it, Daughter. You, visit though. It's a good deed. Don't leave her alone. I don't. I don't, Mother. Don't worry. Mother, I'm going to lie awake a little. Okay, Daughter. O Yahweh,... ...help her. Don't let her suffer any more. Take her with you and save her from this wrath. Don't let her suffer any more. I beg you, take her with you. Please, save her from... - Mother? - What happened, Daughter? Nothing, Mother. Angel? Daughter? Open your mouth. Come on, My deary daughter. Angel? You have to eat it. Come on, Daughter. Angel? Daughter? Angel? What have I done? Mother? May it be easy, Uncle Hasan. How are you? - Thank you, Daughter. How are you? - I'm fine too. What's up, Edith? Good. Let's talk a little bit. Yeah, sure. Come. Daughter, I'm going to coffee house. Okay, Father. Did you hear... A peasant woman recently saw Havel around the house? And when she saw her, she got scared and ran away. And later she notified, but... ...when they were there, they couldn't find anyone out. I heard. I heard. That also reached my mother's ears. Everyone says something, you know. It's been three years, but it's still like yesterday. That never leaves my dreams. Gloria? Last night, something bad happened to me. I saw Angel & Havel in my room. Something like a nightmare. Please, don't remind. Let's not talk about this. I also have nightmares constantly. Gloria, I'm scared. That woman is uncanny. And now they've spread another rumor. Supposedly, this woman formerly had two small children. Then these children died of tuberculosis. She sings lullabies to them,... ...thinking she still lives with them... ...because she couldn't accept their death. So she sacrifices chickens and cats. What? Supposedly, that's why she wanted to sacrifice Angel. She was going home because her kids were there. How do they make up these craps! Gloria, what a terrible event we've been in, like this? Don't ask, I also think about this all the time. Rose escaped and saved herself, of course. We're still paying the piper. She called me last night. She said "I'm going to visit Angel tomorrow, and by the way let me see you-all?" Gracious! How did we occur to her... Actually, it's better her not to come, do you know? I mean, I'm more sad for ourselves when I see her. She is lucky, you know. Yes, she is. - Here I am? - Hello? George, I'm leaving. I'm going to stay at my family tonight. Okay, honey, so when will you be back? On Sunday evening, I'll be back at 7-8 o'clock if nothing goes wrong. - Be careful. - Okay. - I love you. - Okay, honey, I love you too. - See you. - Goodbye. Sister? Are you going to tell Rose about Michael? I'm going to tell, but I don't know what she will react to. I don't think she will care a lot. Same here! But I'm still confused. So be it. You, tell her soon and... - ...don't let it seem strange. - Okay, see you. See you. Daughter... What is happening? Nothing, Father. - May it be easy, Mother. - Thanks, Daughter. Mother, did my father call up? When is he being back? He would be back tomorrow... but there were more lines at the customs, he can't be back before 2-3 days. Huff, you don't say! I miss him so much. I texted him though, but it seems "non-delivered." That's had no signal, Daughter. The man pegs away at. Is it so easy away from home... Huff. Did you sleep, Daughter? Edith? Edith? Daughter? Did you sleep, Daughter? Daughter? Edith? Edith? Edith? Did you sleep, Daughter? Edith? What happened, Daughter? You slept and just didn't wake up. I couldn't wake you up. You fell asleep. I just couldn't wake you up. I couldn't wake you up. A nightmare. I had a nightmare. I hope nothing's wrong, My child. Welcome. Thank you, Aunt Magdalen. I wanted to visit when I heard what happened. Is Uncle David home? He is, he is. Don't mind my father. But don't worry, I talked to my father. He will handle it. Aunt Magdalen. I allocated this from my pocket-money. Oh no, I can't accept this. But please? Look, believe me, I feel much better... ...when I can do something for Angel. Please. Uncle David. How are you? Thank you, Daughter. Angel? My dear friend. How are you? I always think about you, Angel. I pray every day for you to get better. You remember me, don't you? You're always in my mind. I brought you something, Angel. Do you remember my earrings? They were my favorite earrings. I dropped and lost them when we were in sophomore year. I looked for them all day, but I didn't find. Then you went out to the school garden without our knowledge, and you sought them out for hours. I was really glad when you brought me them. I brought you them. Look, let's see, will you remember? My dear friend. Do you remember our good days? You keep them. Because of that bad woman,.... ...we're all unhappy. We're all upset, My dear friend. What did she do to you! But you, don't worry. Don't worry. That woman will be caught. She will be caught and will pay for. Daughter? It's late, come on, you, go home now. Okay, father. - May it be easy, Father. - Thanks, My child. - See you. Sister, we're here, sister. We're under the cover. - Sister, just come, sister, we're here. - What are you doing there? Come out! - We're under the cover, sister. - Sister, we're here, sister. Sister, it's bleeding. - Here I am, Mother? - Rose, aren't you coming? - I'm coming, Mother. - Where are you? - I'm on my way. Why are you so late? I called up my friend, I'm coming now. - Okay, Daughter. Use the car carefully. - Okay, Mother, okay. See you later. - See you, honey. She put a bed & quilt on here. She was always staying here... - Why did the police come? - They caught the sorceress who kidnapped that girl. And this time, she kidnapped another girl. - Rose, they caught the woman. Come. - Gloria? - Come, they caught Havel. - Gloria, is it you? - It's me, Rose. Come, I'm inside. Gloria? Rose? An...gel? Daughter! David, run! Daughter! I guess Edith won't come here? She said "She would." She comes soon. Is that still the same? After that day, we couldn't pull ourselves together, Rose. Gloria, we had nothing else to do. Rose. I've been having bad nightmares for two nights. I'm not good either, Gloria. We've had it rough. But it will pass, Yahweh willing. Come to the point. What are you going to talk to me? I don't know if it still... ...matters to you,... ...but,... ...I'll get engaged to Michael. I'm happy for you. Good luck with it, Yahweh willing. I didn't know how to tell you. But eventually, you were going to learn anyway. There's nothing to hide in that. I haven't seen Michael for years. And it never matters to me anyway. At that time, he was a two-month childhood love. And it's gone. That's it. I mean,... ...how do I know,... ...don't refrain from me. When you think about what you did for him at that time, you know. Don't be ridiculous, Gloria. It's been a long time. We were all kids. Don't worry about it. If it's any comfort,... ...Michael has no value for me. Believe me. Hello. How are you, girls? The same. As you see. And you? Me too. Angel got worse last night. Aunt Magdalen heard a scream from Angel's room. Angel was shaking when she got there. Let's go visit, if you want? No. Today, her father was going to take her to a preacher to practice a faith healing. What a pity. We're guilty of leaving her there, like that. Edith. Did we have anything else to do? Please don't keep to bring up the same subject, over and over again. Whatever happens, we shouldn't have left her there. Edith. Could you be quiet? Everyone is looking at us. The sorceress named Havel, haunts my dreams, Rose. It's like she's punishing me. Edith. Could you please drop the subject? We left her there. All of this wouldn't happen, if we hadn't left her alone. You left this place, of course. But we're still paying the price. Yahweh is punishing us. I'm leaving. This (girl) came here to fight me. I wish we had never met. Goodbye, Gloria. None can avert this (doom) besides Yahweh. (The Star-58) (It will be said:) "Thou wast heedless of this; now have We removed thy veil, and sharp is thy sight this Day!" (Letter Qaf-22) Does It Who has created (all things) not know (Its own creation)? It knows all that is abstruse and subtle, and is All-Aware. (The Dominion-14) Does It Who has created (all things) not know (Its own creation)? It knows all that is abstruse and subtle, and is All-Aware. (The Dominion-14) Due to a discomfort in this poor girl's brain,... ...The doors between her & the other world are opened part way. The veil in her eyes disappeared. The eye of her heart is opened. She is a servant beloved of Yahweh. But be careful though. This girl is enchanted by someone. There is a great grudge in the heart of the underdog. This grudge, this anger is so great that,... ...she always curses. Yahweh knows; ... ...who or why she curses. But what I understood;... ...she also doesn't know who to curse. She mentioned the name "Irresistible", tens of thousands of times. A virtuous name "Irresistible" of Yahweh, which is in 16th place of "Names of Yahweh",... ...is mentioned to ruin & destroy the enemy. The name "Irresistible" is like a sharp knife on both sides. The one who spelled it unjustly, ruins oneself. This curse ascends to the sky and... ...searches for its destination,... ...as stated in the Hadiths. It's so strong and powerful that,... ...if it goes the wrong places,... ...it could harm even innocent people. Angels who are helpers of this,... ...can't move because of this curse. If this curse arrived at,... ...It turns his/her life into a living hell. But... ...for this girl to find peace though,... ...you should wait for this curse to take effect. May Yahweh... ...be a helper of the one who is exposed to... ...this girl's curse. - Come here! Come. - Let me go! I didn't do anything. Shut up! Shut up! Don't shout! Aren't you ashamed to go out with this face, Girl? - Shut up! Be still! - Slut! I'll... you know what, kill you! What's your photo doing in Michael's phone? - I swear, I didn't do anything. - Look, if you publish it once, kill you, I swear, I will. Kill you, I swear, I will. - Cut! Cut, cut, cut. - How is it? Is it being fun? - Hold! - And she tries to seduce Michael. - Hold her. I'll kill you. Slut! Take it! Take it, and rub it on the slut. Take it. Rub, rub, rub. I didn't do anything. - I swear. - Aren't you ashamed to seduce your friend's lover? - Rub, rub, rub. - What is Michael's photo doing in your phone? - What photo? I don't know any photos or something? - Wait, I'm going to pay her back. - Aha, it's going to work. - How she fakes us... Get up! - Angel? - Get up, Buddy! Angel, get up! Girls, let's go, quick. - Oh, what do you say, Rose? Let's leave her like this? - We didn't do anything. Didn't you all see, she fell by herself? We didn't do anything. Come on. Get up! Come on, she fell by herself! Come on! Girls, girls, girls... Someone is there. - Let's run, come on. What do you stand for? - She is the sorceress called Havel. What is she doing there? - She saw us. - Come on, let's go notify, come on. - Okay, let's notify, but we should say "The woman did this". Okay? - Well, Rose, but the woman didn't do anything. - Gloria, Girl, are you a fool? We should say "We did this"? Hey, we'll be ruined, don't you understand? The woman is already a freak. Nobody believes her. Edith, come on. Come on, quick. - Welcome, Daughter? - Thank you, Mother. Daughter, something wrong? There's nothing. There's something, there's. Come here with me. Come come. What happened, Daughter? There's nothing, Mother. YOU bring that soil back home? Aren't you ashamed to seduce your girlfriend's lover? Your mouth, open your mouth! - Where are you going, Father? - I'll be right back, I'm busy. What are you doing, Father? I'm preparing a coffin, Daughter. Whose coffin, Father? Come here, let me see! How is it? Good? George? - Here I am? - Hello, George? Where are you? I'm coming, I'm on my way. There's some traffic. I'm home in half an hour. - Okay. Okay. - See you... She's an innocent and good-hearted butterfly of our class. She's a ladybug always smiling and bringing us joy. You taught us how beautiful and hard life is, Angel. You put both a rainbow and dark clouds on our back, Angel. You gave us both hope and sadness, with your beautiful eyes, Angel. Our prayers are always with you. Angel, the girl laughing when her nose is touched. Fear a curse of an aggrieved and a wronged person. Because there's no veil between a curse of aggrieved and Yahweh.
