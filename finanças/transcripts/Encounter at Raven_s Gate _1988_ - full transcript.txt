What's that?! You're hopeless! Well...it hasn't moved for a couple of days. What about Hemmings? I suppose we better tell him. Dr Hemmings...are you there? Hemmings...! We're picking up a strong signal from Queensland... 12-14, sir... What type? Hard to say, sir. It hasn't moved much for 3 days. Just sitting there, minding its own business... You mean it's down?! Looks like it, sir. Christ, you guys are good... If you want those down, it'll take you 72 hours to get hold of them. How far? About 600 miles...West-Sou'-West I better get going then, eh? Yes sir...it's a long drive. Now...what's the story? Map reference two-niner two-0 four-three-four... Appeared at approximately 0300 hours... three days ago. Since then, no movement... otherwise the patterns are normal. Locality? Nearest to the target property... named Raven's Gate. We're still waiting for occupant-information... The census computer is down. Typical! Has Becker been informed? No...not yet, sir. Good luck, boys! Dr Hemmings...Dr Hemmings... Hemmings. It's taken off sir...it's moving. Moving where...for Christ's sake? We're tracking...it's heading at about 10 knots... Due east from Raven's Gate. It's slow...but steady. Is she breaking?...are we damaged? No, I'm...500 miles away. Cut the shit, will you!... New instructions. Map reference 29...333...88 About 20 miles east of Raven's Gate. Might want to clear out the Cleary property. Occupants two, maybe three... Richard Cleary and Rachel Cleary. Oh Christ!... Don't shoot! Hands in your pockets! Deeper! Anything you say! Now, be careful of that thing... it's got a hair-trigger! I think you're makin' a mistake... Far enough, Sergeant. Look...I didn't see anything... I don't know anything! For a minute there I thought you were gonna shit yourself. Stupid bastard. Whatta you call that... karate or somethin'? Dr Hemmings... I'm an astrophysicist... ...attached to Special Branch. Do you know this area?... I need a guide. I'd like to help, but I've got duties in Paxton. A sense of responsibility's a rare thing these days, Sergeant. I admire that. I think we gonna make a fine team. D'you know how much this radio costs? Paxton had raffles for 6 months to pay for that! From now on, Sergeant, everything we find or learn is strictly confidential. I don't much like the way you ask for help. - What's your name, Sergeant? - What? What's your name? Taylor. To what do we owe the pleasure of meeting you out here... Sergeant Taylor? Nothin'! The local copper asked me to come out...OK? Something about a stolen football trophy... this isn't even my district. Who lived here? The Clearys... Richard and his wife Rachel. There was a brother...one, Edward... hear tell of him at all? It's just that sometimes details are easy to overlook. So don't hold back...alright? Otherwise our partnership is just gonna be useless. Eddie!... Eddie...I've got better things to do than sit here revving your engine. Find that funny...huh? What makes you laugh? As a matter of fact you do! Richard and his bloody water! A little water never hurt anyone. I thought you told me you'd checked the water in the east paddock... Yeah...I was out there yesterday. Well...you could've fooled me... That trough is bone dry and there's half a dozen dead sheep. When I was out there yesterday, everything was OK. Well...an animal doesn't dry up like this in a day. Okay...go get 'em cleaned up before the dingoes get at 'em. Bill!... Bill!... Tea's on! It's not the sheep... They're practically more trouble than they're worth... I just don't like the idea of him lying to me... ...and thinking he could get away with it. Move it, 'Fats'. Please...this is our future. No...this is our dinner. Why don't you take Eddie to the pub and talk things out like brothers... - You're not his father. - Yeah...who said I was? That's the way you talk to him. Just give him a bit o' space. Well...he would have a hard time finding more space than he's got out here. What's the story on the water, Richard? Got a problem, Sport? Would you mind turnin' it back on, please? Well...since you're a first-offender... we'll give you one more minute... But...from now on, the limit is three...isn't it? I mean... we're not in the middle of the Gold coast. Good night all...Good lovin'! I'm goin' to town... don't wait up for me. I suppose you'll be wantin' to give me a ticket now. No, no, Cleary...it ain't that simple... There's just you and me on a dirt road... Mate...some other time! Hullo, Bill! Comin' in for one...? My shout! Never known you to knock back a beer. There's lots that you don't know, Mate. Stay away from 'Raven's Gate'. Hey, fellas...Drink up! Aw...keep it down, George! The name of the horse is a worry in that... What about what's-his-name? The fella with the... Bloody traitors. Get 'em in the full lights and we'll murder the bastards. What about Cleary... he's never stood for the bar. How's things in your little corner of paradise? Dry...very dry... Will I see you later? Why else would I come in here? What's wrong with Bill McCallum? I don't know...I haven't seen him. Cleary...did you ever play football? Bullshit!...Everyone's played football... even girls! Not me! We're playin' to keep the cup in Crealy. Good luck to you. Did you turn queer in prison... or somethin'? You been queer all along. Afraid you're gonna mess up your hair, Sweetheart? Get lost, Bruce! Jist 'avin' a talk! Give 'im a dress to wear, mate!... It'll go with 'is earrings! How about it, Cleary? You wanna wear a dress? Lindsay...don't think any your dresses 'd fit me. Git!...jerk! Alright...alright. Behave yourself. You...starting trouble again, Cleary? No, Sir!...must be the altitude. Little love note for ya. Your parole won't last long at this rate. Hey, Skinner...ain't you gonna book 'im again?... 'e's committed an assault on my 'ead! Shut up...and get out! How about comin' over after work?... There's...somethin' I want to talk to you about. You can talk to me here... I'm having an early night. It seems every time I ask you over, you're tired. You notice me too, eh? Annie...I don't like this arrangement... I really respect you. Close the door...eh? Here's a champion in this tray... You can smell it. Know who this is? The man I married. Handsome devil. I found him behind the dresser. San Francisco megamist. Whenever you think Eddie's weird... you look at this. How long were you actually inside? 18 months all up. If you don't count the 6 months on Richard's "prison farm". That's pretty stiff for stealing a car, isn't it? Not when it's a police car. Who is it? It's me... There's some kinda trouble with the electricity and I just wanted to make sure you were alright. Yeah...I'm alright... thanks Felix. Are you...still tired? Yeah...I'm still tired. Oh I'm sorry... I thought I heard...voices. Good night, Officer. G'night. G'd evening! What's happening? God's will be done. Maybe I'd better take that. How'd you get behind me? Don't underestimate me, Taylor. What time did he get in? Late, I guess. Yeah...well no wonder he can't do a decent day's work. Richard!... Yeah...I know...I know. I s'pose I should be thankful he landed back at all. 'hoy!...'Sleeping Beauty'... When you're finished with the ploughing, give me a hand with the rig. I love the smell of bacon in the morning! It smells like... Why don't I smell bacon? We weren't sure you were coming back at all. What time did you get in? Couple of hours ago. Bill McCallum rang for you last night. Bill?...What 'd he want? He didn't say. He just wanted to talk to you. I'll catch up with him tonight. Never understand the fascination with that pub. What do you DO all night? Bit o' this and a bit o' that! Bit o' this and a bit o' that, eh? I used to be good at that. Yeah...I bet you were. Funny thing was Felix... I had a feeling something was wrong. It was almost by accident I happened to look up... and noticed it was gone. It's not the crown jewels! It's more important to this town. Is anything else missing? Not that I know of. Have you got any ideas? It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to know...Cleary did it. It's only a football trophy! I still think you're completely mad... None of the charts show any water out here anywhere. Yeah...well I did my own surveys... and they tell me different. There's an artesian basin down there. Oh yeah! A few hundred feet under where you're standing... ...is an ocean of water waiting to be tapped. We can turn this whole area into a paradise. What for? We'll be able to plan ahead... won't we? We won't be at the mercy of the weather. I believe...with water... and proper management... ...this could be rice paddies. I know the water's here... we got the sun the year round... What more do we need? "The Cleary Rice Ranch"! Yep! Why not? We COULD do it together. I just need to be able to count on you. I did check the water in the east paddock. What about a beer in town? Sure! Felix, I'm late for work. I'll only be a minute. You look sick. OK...come in. Close the door... I don't want people to see you in here. What is it? La Traviata! La...Traviata... What's that? It's...tickets to the Sydney Opera House. It's all been arranged... What's arranged? We could stay at my Mum's and ah... I bought a tuxedo... and everything! What are you talking about? I don't even like opera. But it's Verdi! I had to book 3 months ago! Stop it! What do you think you're doing? I know... You were with Cleary last night. So? It's my life. Anyway... I lo... I love you! There's not a lot I can do about that, Felix. I've got to go. If you're nice to me... I could go easy on him. I'd rather you went easy on me. Skinner thinks you took the football cup. Oh...and does 'e? It figures the first thing that goes missing around here 'd get blamed on me. - Has Bill been in? - Not yet. Ok Charlie...see you later... And you too. If Mum had let you stay out here with Dad and me, you'd have been in a lot less trouble. Yeah...maybe. Trouble seems to follow me 'round though... doesn't much matter where I am. Life's hard, isn't it? Whatever happened to 'The Cleary Rice Ranch'...eh? That's it... Water's the answer to it all. Hydroponics. Beer's the answer to it. Hydroponics...anyone know what hydroponics is? I'll tell you what it is... It's the answer to everything. I'm talkin' about our future... hydroponics...ponics of water. My little brother! Looks like we'll get rain before you strike water. Don't you know anything?... That's heat lightning. What 'd you do to 'im? I haven't seen him like this since our wedding night. Hope that means rain. It's heat lightning. Watch your step up there, Sergeant. Filthy bloody thing. The ring's gone. Don't make 'em like they used to, mate What can you see from up there? There's a car coming. Another rice-burner! It's our lunch!... told you we'd get 1st-class treatment. Eh? I told... Don't worry. Hey...not yet, Sarge... I want you to stay up there for a bit longer. Now listen...throw me your ear-piece. What for? Because I'm asking ya! Get out of it! Can't hear ya. Aggressive little bastard. Another creep. Kinda like 'Coordinated Creeps'. The nuts. What've you got in mind for our little mate? No problems... He's as thick as two planks. And then what? If he doesn't like it... doesn't want to cock-up with the police department... ...he just might get it. That's a fat man with thin lips. Keep still. Do what? He's a creep. The Clearys. You got the spooks too, eh...dog? Shit, Rachel! What are you doin' up? Couldn't sleep. What about you? Heard the dog growlin'. It was probably dreamin' about rabbits. Would you stay on after your parole runs out? I don' know. I miss the city. If I weren't with Richard... I'd get back to the city like a shot. Prob'ly go back overseas. If I could ever get the money together, I'd be on the first plane to America. We could go together. That'd be fun! I think you'd have a hard time gettin' Richard to take the time off. This afternoon he wanted to turn the far-back lot into rice paddies. After a couple of beers he was talking about building the biggest greenhouse in the southern hemisphere. Every year it's something different. I don't know what I'm gonna do when you leave. You'll get by. I want more. I don't think this is a real good idea. I think I better go back inside. You tell anyone about this, Dog, I'll never talk to you again. Is something wrong? No...no... Just thinkin'. Might go over and see Bill McCallum a bit later on. Sit down, Richard. You must think I'm a bloody idiot, or blind, or something. What sort of tricks are you two playing at? Now...hang on a minute!... Stay out of this... I'll sort you out later. I hope you're happy. Because of your selfishness I've got 100 plants and 1000 champion seedlings out there, that are dying of thirst. Are they dead? They will be if I don't get water to them. What are you talking about? I'm talkin' about an empty water tank! For the sake of a few supermarket vegetables you've practically destroyed a year's work. The tank was half full yesterday. Yeah...I know that. But it's empty now! And the only thing out there with any water are your stupid bloody veg... I only used a couple of buckets! Now listen...she couldn't have used half a tank on a couple of plants! I suppose you can explain it the same way you did that water in the eastern paddock. Get fucked, Richard! Yeah!...typical..."Get fucked Richard". Where do you think YOU're goin', dog? Ah...well...to tell you the truth... I wouldn't mind some sensible company. It's a long walk back. C'mon... C'mon, dog! Good boy! C'mon...it's your last chance, dog! Suit yourself! Hot day! Yep...hot. Sure is a hot one. I'm lookin' for your brother. I have reason to believe he's stolen our football cup. If he's not in the far-back lot, he'll be at Raven's Gate. Thanks. Ha!...I don't much fancy your chances of finding water here. Bill! Kate! Is there anyone there? Cleary! What's goin' on?! I don't know! Cleary! Dog... C'mon dog...get in! What's happened to Jake? He attacked me. That dog's never attacked anyone in its life! I went out to Raven's Gate... Not a word! Not one word. So where's Ed? I had to tell you that to get you alone. I got a surprise for you. Let me out of here. It'll only take a minute. George is going to start wondering where I am. I bought you somethin' to wear to the opera. I told you...I'm not going. Now open the door, Felix! Close your eyes... Hurry up!... Open!... You've got to be joking! What's wrong with it? It cost me a week's wages! You're pathetic! I've been planning this for three months. My mother's waitin' for us! That's YOUR problem. But she's cooked dinner! I'm not going anywhere with you... especially...in THAT! Put it on... Savvy? Give us a break, Felix! What do you want? You don't expect us to believe that demented bullshit do you?! Richard, something's obviously happened! I don't know...maybe it was an explosion or something. They weren't blown apart... they were welded together. Oh...come on!... Ring Skinner if you don't believe me!... He saw it! Come on...ring him! You see...it was all finished. He's not there. Come out to Raven's Gate with me. Now listen to me for a minute... I think it's pretty obvious... You don't want to be here any more than I want you here. If there's one more fuck-up... I'm bailing out and you're back behind bars. Why won't you come and see for yourself?! Why can't we go?! We should look at... This is between my brother and me! It's a worry...this house is older than you are. I'm surprised it hasn't blown sooner. If you go out there with me... and I'm wrong... I'll leave tomorrow. Tomorrow you're finishing off the back lot. Why won't you listen to me? We've got to buckle up, Annie. "Clickety clack!"... "Front and back." I'm sorry, Annie... But I love you! Parigi, o cara noi lasceremo... La vita uniti trascorreremo... Y'd think the guys in the 'James Bond Branch' 'd have decent cars. I wouldn't be caught dead drivin' a 'rice-burner'. Well you know what it's like with government cut-backs. Most of these roads seem to be dead-ends. As far as I can make out... she's in her mid to late twenties. And not too bad looking from the neck down. I'd say she was dead before she was thrown off the bridge... ...and that would have been about...what?...36 to 48 hours ago. No chance you recognise her I suppose? For Christ's sake...how could I?... The dingoes had chewed her face off. Who's been fiddling with the thermostat in the greenhouse? Richard, nobody's touched it. Oh, right...sure so nobody's touched it... I must have imagined the whole thing Except I've got a bloody dead prize orchid in there... I mean, you didn't do it...he didn't do it.. I must've done it... That makes sense... That makes a lot o' bloody sense. And what the hell's happened to the shower-curtain? There are more important things than orchids, Richard... I swear there's shells for this thing... What is your problem Eddie? You don't need a gun... You're finishing off the back lot! It can get finished...just tell me where the shells are for this gun! I don't see what you're afraid of! You're only too bloody thick! Yeah...and I suppose it takes a genius to be put away! If you don't tell me where those shells are... I'm puttin' the first one I find through your thick skull. He's a mess. I'll go out and check on him later. Did you see his hands? He's having a breakdown. Skinner! Skinner! - Where's Annie? - She's pissed off with Skinner somewhere. With Skinner? I saw them leaving last night. Dressed to kill. And she was all over him like a rash. Well, well, well...look who's here! Any idea when they'll be back? -Wouldn't have a clue. -We've been lookin' for you, lover-boy. -We want our cup back! -I'm not in the mood, Dodson. Oh yeah...that fellas!... He's not in the mood! You look a picture, standin' there. You checked on Eddie? No...not yet. Are you going to? Yeah...when I'm ready. He's all right...he's... ...probably in town screwing the local barmaid. You don't know 'im at all. I sure don't know him the way you do. I've got eyes in my head, Rachel! Jesus!...Bloody hell! You're a bit jumpy, aren't ya? Listen, it's time you came home before you hurt somebody. It's loaded this time. You aren't gonna shoot me. Never trust a madman. Now listen...you got three choices... Either you get outta here... or you help me... That's about it, really. I'm not leavin' here without you. It's probably Rachel. Hey, we're not goin' in there now. It's just an empty farmhouse with the door swingin' in the wind... All the rest is inside your head! C'mon...let's get out of here! You need help... you're comin' home with me! Get off o' me! Not 'til you promise to come quietly! Hey...you know what this reminds me...? God...I forget! Chinese water torture! Don't make...Richard! Say you made the whole thing up! You stupid arse! Say it! Okay! Okay! Okay what? Okay...I made the whole thing up! Say you'll never touch Rachel again! -I didn't do any... - I saw you on the veranda...say it! Alright...I won't touch Rachel again! Alright! That's better... I should o' tried that earlier. I oughta kill you! Let me tell Rachel where I... That's for you! Fuck you, Richard! The bodies are in here. Must've moved 'em. Richard! I don't wanna hurt you! I wanna be your friend! Richard...cut it out! Richard! Come on! Where's Richard? Where's the fuckin' key? Richard's hidden it! Where are the shells for this? Richard's gonna kill you when he gets back. Richard's gone mad, Rachel! What've you done to him? Don't you understand it?... Friggin' Raven's Gate's going! Haven't you figured it out yet?... The water...the power... the McCallum's state...everything! Is he still there? He's comin' here to kill US! What's that sitting on the bureau? Go away! What's wrong with you!? Stop it! Richard! Richard! I don't want to hurt you... I want to be your friend. Get away! He's gone. You did steal it. Yeah... That's the way the criminal mind operates. You OK? Promise me you won't hurt him. Well that depends on him. Shit!... What's going on? He's on the roof. Stay here. What are you doing here? Looking for kerosene. Richard's inside the house. - What are we gonna do? - Find him before he finds us. Get back in the lounge room. He won't be able to come in there without you seein' him. I don't want to shoot you, Richard! Don't shoot him! For Christ's sake, shoot HIM! Richard...I want to help you! What's happening? God's will be done. Bugger it! What's Becker turned up? Got the old couple in. The McCullums.. They're cold aren't they? Quite freezing. What's your report on the house? The encounter was total. Any survivors? One cold and two unaccounted for. I'll reel 'em in. You got it...Anything else? We'll need a complete clean-up. On its way. I got a joke for ya... Why did the sexual perverts cross the road? Wait a minute... I'll talk to you later. - Taylor!... - Yeah? You don't want to help the Clearys... You want to kill them. Same as you want to kill me. Why would I want to do that? 'Cause I know what's going on out here. Don't keep a secret... let me in on it. I'd advise you to leave well enough alone, Sergeant. Your advising days are over, Doctor. Let's see what we have here. Little green men, eh? It's too bad you couldn't restrain yourself. - I could've helped you. - What...as far as letting me live? That's right. I'm glad to see you're taking it so well. You dumb fuck! I unloaded your gun! Must've reloaded it. So you are the Clearys? I'm psychic. And who do you think's gonna win the big game tomorrow? The sleep of the innocent. Two out of three's not bad. To get any of them. Why didn't he? Because he's still stuck in the chair. I'll see ya. Rachel! We did our best! Don't forget this! Monday morning feels so bad Ev'rybody seems to nag me Coming Tuesday I feel better Even my old man looks good Wednesday just don't go Thursday goes too slow I've got Friday on my mind Gonna have fun in the city Be with my girl she's so pretty She looks fine tonight She is out of sight to me Tonight....I spend my bread Tonight...I lose my head Tonight...I got to get tonight Monday I have Friday on my mind.
