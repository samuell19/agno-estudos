(suspenseful music) (pensive music) (bass thuds) - [Annie Voiceover] This is the story of a murder. Several murders, in fact. (bass thuds) It begins with the men in my life, but don't think it's a love story. That was my first mistake. (bass thuds) In the end it's just a little fairy tale about feeling desperate, and that's what makes it my story. I ran away from home when I was 19. When I met Bill, he was the man of my dreams. Bill used to say it was love at first sight. Love, (glass crashes) If that's we started with, soon faded. - Annie! You left this door open all night. You know, somebody coulda gotten in. - Oh, I guess that storm the other night must've warped it. - Let's get it fixed, huh? - I got something to tell you. - Oh yeah? How 'bout telling me what's for breakfast? - Cereal. - Don't they teach you how to make a real breakfast in that cooking class? - [Annie] We haven't gotten to breakfast yet, Bill. - I thought you wanted to learn how to cook. - This cooking class was your idea, remember? - [Bill] So you don't wanna learn how to cook? - I didn't say that. - [Bill] Good. - I've got something to tell you. - 'Cause soggy flakes every morning ain't cuttin' it. - I got a job! You know that grocery store over by the freeway? Well, I was there the other day and they were hiring, so I thought, why not go for an interview? - Is that what you thought? - Anyway, I got the job. I can start Monday. But I said I'd better check with my husband first. (Bill laughs) - It's, that's, it's great, honey. I'm proud of you. Don't think I'm not proud of you, 'cause I am. It's just that, you remember what happened with that secretary job last year? All that phoning and faxing and sitting at the computer all day? We never had a chance to see each other. Come on, you don't wanna go through that again, now do you? - No. - Tell those losers over at the grocery store, you know, thanks a lot, but you like it here just fine, hmm? Okay? - Okay. - (clucks) I gotta go. I'll call you later. - [Annie Voiceover] That's where the trouble begins. You're isolated. Alone. Murder could be the last thing on your mind. - 'Cause you married me and you're stuck with me. Like the man said, till death do us part, baby. (Bill snorts) - [Annie Voiceover] But every day it gets harder and harder to breath. (Bill choking) The more suffocated you feel, the more you wanna do somethin'. - I'm okay. - [Annie Voiceover] I didn't run away because sooner or later Bill would end up killing me. I ran away because sooner or later I knew that I'd let him. That's what it's like to be a prisoner. All you can think about is trying to escape. You'll rely on anything. Even luck. You run for the sake of running. You run even though there's nowhere to go. I almost made it, too. But I always underestimate how much Bill loves me. You might say that he more than loves me. He needs me. (sniffles) He'll be right out. - Hey, Annie. - Oh, Clark. You scared me to death. (sniffles) - I'm sorry. Is Bill ready? - Yeah, he'll be right down. - You know, I haven't seen you since the award ceremony last month. - Right. Congratulations, by the way. - On what? - On being a hero, with Bill and Beth and everything. - Oh. Yeah. - [Annie] Bill made me have the picture framed. You must be really proud. - I'm just glad nobody got hurt. - Yeah. - You know, I'm gonna wait by the car. - Sorry, Clark. Annie has us running a little behind this morning. Okay. Honey, be sure to change the fluids in the car, okay? Annie? - I'll take care of it. - How you doin', man? - [Annie Voiceover] So there I was. Trapped. No chance of divorce. No life. No way out. - This is it? - What do you mean? - I mean... What about a side dish? How 'bout some sausage or bacon? Since when does anyone serve eggs without some sorta side dish? You know, I gotta be honest with you, Annie, it appears as if, by the looks of this breakfast, that you're not focusing on the cooking aspects of your cooking class. How many men are in that class? - I've told you a thousand times, Bill, it's all women. - You're cheating on me, aren't you? - I'm not cheating on you. - Just listen to me. You can tell me. You don't have to lie. - Bill- (Annie gasps) - What? You gonna cry? You gonna cry like a crybaby? Just remember while you're crying who saved you from that freak called Daddy. If I hadn't come along, you'd still be taking baths with that sick old fuck! Without me you're nowhere! - I just want to make you happy. - Oh, you want to make me happy? - Yes. - Then how 'bout a fuckin' side dish! - [Annie Voiceover] Which way do you turn when there's no way out? Which way do you turn? - Ladies? Gentlemen? If I could have your attention, I'd like to introduce you to the newest member of our class, Mr. Thomas Nance. - Ah... Call me Tommy, please. - Tommy it is. (chef chuckles) - Thank you. - Hey, Beth. - Hey, Annie. How you doin'? Bill said you'd be here tonight. Then you realize you're dying of boredom. - Eh, it's not so bad. - (laughs) Yeah, right. So what are you doin' here? I told Mike that if he learned how to cook I'd be his sex slave forever, so... (Annie giggles) Oh, I get it. Bill gets a little variety in his menu, so you get a little variety in yours. - No! - Yes! I saw you checkin' that guy out. - No! - Well, I don't blame you. I'd kinda like to peel his potato. I'm gonna leave you two alone. - You need a partner? I could use all the help I could get. You know, to be perfectly honest, I've always been a miserable failure at side dishes. How 'bout you? - Me too. - I didn't get your name. - Annie. - That's pretty. - [Teacher] All right. Now, tonight we're going to focus- - Oh. - [Teacher] On a plethora of side dishes. - It's starting. - [Teacher] Okay, first I want you all to break into partners. - Goodnight, Annie. - Goodnight, Beth. - [Tommy] May I walk you to your car? - I don't know. - Who's your friend? - Beth? Oh, she works with my husband Bill. - Isn't she a cop? - How do you know? - Teacher must've mentioned it. - [Annie] So you cook? - A lotta men cook. - Not the men I know. - Oh, so you're saying maybe I have an ulterior motive for being here? - No! I- - Like maybe I'm here to pick up girls or something? - No! (Tommy laughs) - It just so happens that I travel a lot in my work and after a while every restaurant starts to taste the same. - Where do your travels take you? - Oh, Europe, South America. Last year I went to China. - China? - Would you like to go to China? - No, I... Well, I'd kinda like to go anywhere. This is mine. - This is mine. - So you're not cooking, what do you do for a living? - May I take your picture? - What? - [Tommy] What's your last name? - Summers. (shutter clicks) - [Tommy] Annie Summers. - How do I look? (shutter clicks) - Lonely. (shutter clicks) - [Annie] Hmm. - Sorry. (Annie laughs) What? - I just can't remember the last time a man apologized to me. - [Tommy] I'll have to do it more often then. - You never answered my question. - [Tommy] What question was that? - What is it that you do. - For a living? - Yes. - I kill people. (Annie chuckles) (Tommy laughs) - [Annie] What do you really do? - Ah, photographer. I'm doing a project on suburbia. - What would you say if I asked to take your picture? (pensive music) - How do I look? - You look lonely too. (shutter clicks) - I guess you're looking pretty forward to your cooking class tonight. You got home pretty late last time. - I got home around the usual time. - [Bill] You came home at 10:30. Usual time's 10 o'clock. - We must've run late. - We? - I must've run late. - Honey, you don't get home on time, I worry about you. - Clark? - Annie, hi. I didn't think Bill ever let you out of the house. - Oh, well, I sneak out once in a while. Didn't expect to see you here. - Yeah, well... It's my day off and I figured I'd better stock my kitchen. - Well, doesn't Sarah do your cooking? - Yeah. Yeah, she did. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Well, apparently I'm too boring. (chuckles) The fact that I'm a lousy cook didn't help either. - Well, I guess it's not as easy as we thought to find the right person. - Yeah, well, we all make mistakes. Listen. Bill and I go back to high school and I know he's not a prince or anything... (Clark sighs) Look, I don't wanna step on any toes, but I know people who could help you. - I called the police twice last year. I guess when it comes to protection, they start with their own. So I appreciate your concern, but there's really nothing you can do. (ominous music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hey, Beth, it's Annie. Do you know if Bill is working late tonight? - Uh, yeah. He was just typing up a report when I left. - Oh, I guess I'll just leave his dinner in the fridge then. - Hmm. Look, stop worrying so much. And don't be late for class, 'cause it's soup and salad night. (muffled gunshot cracks) Yeah. - [Woman on TV] Why are we moving so fast? - Mikey! Honey, can you turn the TV down? Mike? - [TV] Let go of me! Please! - Come on! - What are you doing? (ominous music) You're hurting me! (Beth gasps) Help! Help! (woman on TV screams) - Now, the first step in preparing the souffle is a very challenging one. Again, crack your egg on the side of the bowl. Good. Now tip the egg to one side and carefully pass the yolk from one half of the shell into the other. And there, you see? It's easy. - (laughs) You did it. - Not without making a mess in the process. Sorry. If I lost this, you never would've forgiven me. (soft music) - [Teacher] Has anyone seen Beth tonight? You sure? - [Annie] Where were we? - My parents. Pretty much raised myself. I did some time in the military. That's where I started to get interested in photographing things. What about you? - Oh, my mom died when I was 12 and my dad, well, I think he's alive somewhere. We didn't really get along, so I ran away. That's when I met Bill. - Coffee and one peach pie. - Thank you. - Anything else? - No. - Okay. If you need anything else, just gimme a holler. - Thanks. May I ask you something? - Sure. - What would your husband do if you lost your wedding ring? Would he hurt you? Ah... Look, I'm sorry. It's none of my business. - No, and it's, um, it's not your problem. I, uh... I really, I really should get going. - If somebody's hurting you, they should be stopped. (somber music) - Sometimes he hits me. - [Tommy] Sometimes? - A lot. - Have you gone to the police? - [Annie] Twice. But they can't do anything. - Well, maybe I could offer another alternative. I knew a woman who went through the same things you're going through with her husband. - What did she do? - [Tommy] She had him killed. - How? - You don't wanna know. - [Annie] I do. - Pretty terrible. She had him decapitated with an axe. - Oh my god. - While he was sleeping. - That's so Perfect. - See, I'm glad you feel that way. I told her... (laughs) I said, don't do it like that. It's so messy. You see, my motto is keep things simple. Do your homework, carefully. The rest is, ah, execution, so to speak. (brooding music) - What happened to the woman? - I don't know. I'd like to think that she lived happily ever after. - [Annie] So where do you stay while you're in town? - Oh, I have this place downtown I like to stay at whenever I'm here. - Uh-huh. Hotel? - No, that's too public. I do business here more and more so I finally rented a place. It's really nice. You oughta come visit sometime. Do you ever get downtown? - No, you know. My husband. - Ah. You know, in China they have this saying about women: "She can live the life of a prisoner, she can live the life of a princess, or she could be herself." (pensive music) Which one are you? - Oh, this is getting confusing. - No. This is getting exciting. (crickets chirping) - [Bill] You coulda called. I was getting ideas. - I... I'm sorry. I stayed late to help clean up. - (laughs) I don't want you going to that class anymore. - Bill. - I know I didn't turn out the way you wanted me to. And I know I'm not perfect. (cylinder clicking) But you don't have to go cheat on me. - I'm not. - Don't lie to me. - Bill! Just give it to me. (ominous music) Take it. Before I do something stupid with it. (Annie gasps) - No, Bill! Bill! - Who is it? - No! No one, please! - Who is it? - No one! - You're killing me! (Annie screams) (hammer clicks) (Bill sobs) Just don't go to that class anymore. I don't want you going to that class, okay? - Murder-suicide. It's the third one this year. Excuse me. Husband takes her out, then he sits in his favorite chair and turns the gun on himself. Did you know him? - No, not enough to explain this. - It's tough. I gotta take a piss. You wanna finish this? - No thanks. (police radio chatter) (bell chimes) - [Waitress] Here you go. - Thanks for meeting me. - You all right? - Yeah, I am. I had to wait for Bill to leave for work. - [Tommy] Well, you sounded so upset on the phone. - Yeah, well, uh... I can't come to class anymore. I wanted to say goodbye to you face to face. I didn't want you to think I was mad at you. - You could leave him. - He'd find me. - [Tommy] You could run away. - I've got nowhere to go. - You could come with me. Annie. Come away with me. - I don't even know you. - You know enough. I'll be leaving soon. I want you to go with me. I want to take care of you. It's simpler than you think, Annie. One day you wake up, you're someplace new, someplace beautiful. No Bill. Just you and me. (brooding music) - I can't. - I can. - I can't. I can't. Goodbye. (ominous music) (Zippo clinks) (floorboard creaks) Bill? Bill? Bill? You're home early. - Daddy was right. Give the bitch an inch and she'll rip your fuckin' arm off. - What's wrong? - I had a bad day today. Beth's dead. - What? - [Bill] Mike killed her. - What? - I came home to tell you, but you weren't here. So I went looking for you. (ominous music) Get off my fuckin' bed. (belt buckle rattles) - Bill, no! No! - [Bill] Let go of that! Let it go! Who is he? - No, Bill! Please! - Who, you bitch? Fucking bitch! - [Annie] No! Stop it, Bill! No! (screams) - Who is it? Who is it? - [Annie] No! No! Please! (thunder rumbles) - [Clark] Hey, you got my messages? - You forgot your faxes again. - Hey, I'm sorry. - Try checking your box once in a while? (ominous music) (man whistles) (mouths silently) - Damn. Annie? Annie? - Hi, Clark. - Oh my god. - [Annie] It's gonna be okay. - I want you to take this. And you use it if you need me. Take it. (Annie moans softly) (brooding music) (distant bell tolls) (thunder rumbles) (rain pattering) - You won't have to do anything. - There's nothing you can do. - I know. I understand. You're the first person the police would look to. (suspenseful music) Whatever happens, it has to look like an accident. Tell me more about Bill. His routine. He leaves for work about 9:30, doesn't he? - [Annie] Every morning. How did you know? - [Tommy] I guess his day's probably spent patrolling, huh? Answering calls for help? - [Annie] That's right! - [Tommy] Pretty high-pressure stuff. If you wouldn't mind, I'd like to come by your house tomorrow. - [Annie] Why? - [Tommy] Just to visit. Check in, see how you're doing. - [Annie] Oh! You, you can't. What if Bill came home? - [Tommy] It would only be for a few minutes. - [Annie] No, I, I can't allow that. - Doesn't this door close? - It's warped. What... I told you not to come here! - How are you feeling? Better? (foreboding music) - You have to leave! - A very nice neighborhood. It's a little quiet for my taste, but I think it's perfect. May I use your bathroom? - What if Bill comes home? - [Tommy] Are you expecting him? - No. - Do you know what ZTA is? Using the proper dosage, it can cause unconsciousness for about 30 minutes. See, but the trick is to use enough to be effective and still not enough to be detected later, you know what I mean? God, you look pretty today. I just wanted to come by and make sure everything was okay. - I'm fine. - I wish there was more I could do for you. - You've already done so much. - Not yet. But I will. - I appreciate what you're saying, you know. I really do. But everything's under control. It's all right. - I saw her. I saw her face. - Hey, how are you? Good to see you. (phone rings) You know, there's something my daddy always told me. Good advice. He said, "You want to keep your good friends? Stay out of their bedrooms." - Look, Bill, all I'm saying is if you're having trouble then you should talk to somebody. You can talk to me, talk to her, but you gotta talk to somebody, man. - Is she talking to you? - No- - No, is she talking to you? - Listen to me now. If she's talking to you, she's giving you half the story. Did she tell you she's cheating on me? - Whether she is or not is irrelevant. You're beating on your wife and you need to check yourself, man. (police chattering) (phone rings) (Bill sighs) - [Bill] Okay. (crickets chirping) (wind chimes ring softly) (foreboding music) (dial tone hums) (phone beeping) (line ringing) (phone rings) (ominous music) (phone ringing) Where are you goin'? You wanna go to your cooking class, don't you? - Yes. I know you're gonna be mad- - No, listen, it's okay. - Tonight's the final exam and I, I really have to go. What's that? - Well, it's just a little somethin' I grabbed for you on the way home. - You bought me flowers? - Yeah. - Um... There's chicken and potatoes in the oven for you. - It smells good. (chuckles) - [Annie] Yeah. It has pesto. - What? What-so? - Pesto. It's kind of a seasoning. You mix it up with potatoes. It makes a great side dish. - Sounds like pretty complicated stuff. You sure you can't stay? I mean, there's a ballgame on tonight. I figured we'd take it in together. - I'll be home soon. I promise. - Oh yeah, okay. I'm not goin' anywhere. (crowd cheering) - [Announcer] And knocks the ball away. A well-timed leap- - It should be seamless. - He's a nice man. - Well, you know, I guess you just never really know about people. Well! Look who's back. - I'm sorry. - I'd just about given up on you. - I'm sorry I'm late. Have you seen Tommy? - Nope, not tonight. Maybe he's late too, I don't know. - [Announcer] And Best makes the second free throw. (door creaks) - [Announcer] What was he last year? 62%? - [Announcer] 62%, that's right. And give a little of that credit to a fine coaching staff. - [Announcer] Exactly, yeah, and the fact also that the team's intact from last season. (TV volume lowers) - [Announcer] When you know how to play with each other as much as these guys, you know, experience builds confidence. - [Announcer] Okay, Hazle comes in with 3:15- - [Bill] Annie? - [Announcer] Evans is out. 15 on the shot clock. - [Bill] Annie? - [Announcer] He skies to finger-roll it in and it's down by seven. (dog barking) (wind chimes ringing softly) - [Announcer] Much respect for his outside shooting. - [Announcer] Right now he's forced Adams to commit. Here comes Delwood to pick him up, leaving Richards free for the easy pick-and-roll. Nice pass from *. Very good. And Michaels dribbles across the time line. (tense music) (crickets chirping) Now rewarding him, takes and drives. Reverse layup blocked by Delwood. (dog barks) (TV announcers chattering) Sure it is. Tough defense is what it's all about. Delwood intimidates Donovan into a difficult shot, he knocks the ball away. Double-times it, leak right, Adams blindsiding Dawson, leaving the possible three-point play. Oh! It's a bad foul there. Yeah, he should've just taken- (air whooshing) Now Christie's taken out and Kennedy is in. Stewart makes the free throw. They're down by two. Coming in is Evans for Mike Lewis. He's got 14 points. (tense music) (students chattering) (phone rings) (line rings) (coin rattles) (ominous music) (line rings) (phone ringing) (faucet running) (phone ringing) (ominous music) (water splashing) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) - I'm comin'. (shutter clicks) (body thuds) (tense music) (TV announcers chattering) (engine cranks) (tires squeal) (chilling music) (Bill screams) (crickets chirping) (Bill groaning) (Bill grunts) (Bill laughs hoarsely) (Bill shouting) (tires screech) (dramatic music) - No! (blood splatters) (tense music) (Bill grunting) - Annie. - I told you I'd save you. (gunshot cracks) (heartbeat thumping) (TV announcers chattering) (heartbeat thumping slowly) (clock ticking) (distant traffic honking) (soft jazz music) (dishes clink) Hungry? - Where's Bill? - I made crepes. Just like the ones we made in class. Fresh-squeezed orange juice. And look what I found at the market. Strawberries. It's what you wanted. - Where are my clothes? - Everything will be all right now. - I need my clothes! - You can do anything you want. - Don't say that. - You'll be safe with me. - [Annie] I have to go back! - You mean leave? - Yes! - Leave me? - Yes! - Fine. Fine. Whatever you want. (dial tone hums) Wanna turn yourself in? Be my guest. - You had a knife. - Your knife. Your fingerprints. Your home. Your marriage. - But you... - I wasn't even there. You can't go back, Annie. (brooding music) Why would you want to? Please. Yes. (dark, pensive music) Drink it. Please? Is it good? - [Annie] Mm-hmm. - I got a surprise for you. - What is it? - [Tommy] A present. As long as you're with me you have nothing to worry about. Nothing at all. - We have a corpse. We have a knife wound in the abdomen, not to mention a gunshot wound in the chest. What we don't got is a wife. Call me a novice, but I think it's a safe bet that the prints we pull from said .38 and said knife are gonna fit her like a glove. You knew her, didn't ya? - We spoke a few times. - You were friends? - Not really, no. - Bill's car's in the garage. - So if both cars are here, then how'd she get away? - On foot? I don't know. - Maybe with someone else. - Look, Clark, I got murder in the first with a vicious fuckin' intent. You got a theory about your friend, fine, give her a call, but don't her fuckin' husband to answer because he ain't in. (soft, pensive music) - Would you like to go away? - Where? - China. We leave in 48 hours. You miss him? Are you sorry he's dead? (Tommy sighs) This is my last job, Annie. All I want now is you. (pensive music) (shutter clicking) (rain pattering) (thunder rumbles) (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) - The search continues for a Santa Clara woman whose husband was found brutally murdered in his house. Santa Clara police are looking everywhere for the wife of the victim, who has all but disappeared. The victim was a local police officer, best known for his involvement in what has become known as the doll shop drug raid that caused major damage and subsequently shut down a large South American drug operation known as the Buena Ventura cartel. (rain pattering) (thunder rumbles) (somber music) - Nine months ago I got a tip that a doll factory was using slave labor. Bill and Beth check it out. Only, surprise- - Yeah, I know, I know. And they were making heroin instead of dolls and you guys are heroes. You put the Buena Vista cartel out of business for a couple weeks. - Buena Ventura. - [Polito] Whatever. - Bill and Beth are dead. - So you think maybe the Buena Adventure put out a hit on Bill and Beth? - Two domestic killings involving cops who both took part in bringing down- - Bill's no hit. Professional hits don't normally use a kitchen knife. You don't think the wife did it. - I don't know. (haunting music) - I miss ya, honey. (spoon clinking) I'll never let you go. (gunshot cracks) (chilling music) (chimes ring softly) (keyboard clicking) (soft jazz music) (dishes clatter) (shower running) (ominous music) - Good morning. Sleep well? I know it's confusing. You can't go back. Your husband's gone. And as far as the police are concerned, I don't even exist. (distant siren wails) It'll be over soon. And we can go away. And we can forget any of this ever happened. (chilling music) (Annie yelping) - Don't! Don't! - It's all right! Stop! (soft, brooding music) It's all right. Everything is gonna be all right. (Annie breathing heavily) (chains rattle) There, you see? Plenty of room. You can go anywhere you like. - What if I want to leave? - [Tommy] Every relationship has its boundaries. - Are you... Are you gonna kill Clark? - I have to make arrangements for your passport. Tomorrow morning we leave for good. - Tommy? Have you ever killed anyone you loved? (brooding music) (motor whirs) (engine cranks) (chain rattles) (Annie grunts) (somber music) (Annie groans) (pensive music) (suspenseful music) (jars clinking) (tense music) - [Tommy Voiceover] Do you know what ZTA is? Using a proper dosage, it can cause unconsciousness for about 30 minutes. See, but the trick is to use enough to be effective and still not enough to be detected later. (brooding music) - So. They found another set of prints at Bill's. - Whose? - Yours. You go there a lot? - No. I mean, I've picked him up for work every once in a while. - Ever seen this? - [Tommy] Sure. - [Polito] You and Bill go back. - So? - Why don't you tell me what happened here the other day. - That was personal. - Anything to do with the wife? (Clark sighs) - He was beating her. - So she killed him. - No. No, I don't think so. - Then who did? (police chattering) - Are you calling me a suspect? (distant traffic honking) (garage door clanks) (gate clangs) (motor whirring) (chain rattling) (elevator clangs) (gate thuds) (silverware clinks) (keys jingle) - Annie? (cuffs click) (chain rattles) Do you forgive me? - Yes. - Will you go away with me? - [Annie] Yes. - Really? - I'm sorry about before. I should've trust you. I know you were only looking out for our best interests. - What's this? - I made us lunch. (cork pops) (soft jazz music) How is it? - Delicious. - Good. Tell me about China. - What do you want to know? - Oh, um... Where will we stay? - Well, we'd have to find a place to live first. They have residence permits that are called hukou. They're difficult to get, but... Especially for women. (chuckling) We'll get one. - Will you be finished with your work tonight? - Yes. (ominous music) (Tommy groans) (both shout) (dishes crash) (Annie screams) (tense music) (keys jingle) (suspenseful music) (Tommy shouts) (Annie shrieks) (elevator clangs) (Annie screams) (Tommy shouts) (Tommy shouts) (Annie panting) (motor whirs) (elevator thuds) (Annie panting) (gate clangs) (elevator rumbling) (ominous music) (keys jingling) (elevator groans) (gate rattles) (Annie yelps) (chain rattles) - [Annie] Are you gonna kill Clark? - Changed the reservations. We leave tonight. Then tomorrow we start over. You got a problem with that? - No. (light buzzing softly) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (Annie grunts) (wrench squeaks) (Annie gasps) - Little elves down at the lab found a surprise in the blood samples gathered at the scene. Lab results confirmed the blood of the victim along with the blood of someone else. - Annie? - I already checked her out. She's type O. Found type A and type B at the scene. Bill's type A. - I'm type B. - So far I'm the only one that knows. In the meantime I'm having forensics run a comparison between your blood and the blood found at the scene. You got a problem with that? - No. - The way I see it, we got three questions left to answer. If the blood found at the scene is not yours, whose is it? What does Annie have to do with it? And where is she? (pensive music) (keyboard clicking) - Going home? - Yeah. - Forgot your faxes again. - Sorry. - Try and check your box once in a while. - I most certainly will. Thank you. Thank you. (foreboding music) (microwave beeps) (shotgun cocks) (haunting music) - Why are you smiling? - How do I plan on doing it? - How do you mean? - My suicide. Messy. - You'll be sitting when it happens. - What if I don't want to sit? - You'll be standing when it happens. Shall I assume it's loaded? - You shall.
