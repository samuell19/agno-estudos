- God, it reminds me of work! - I know; I'm trying not to think about it. That's what happens when you order weird food! I should’ve had a hamburger. Anyhow, Saeko was really pretty today. Oh, anyone looks good in a wedding gown. You gotta hand it to her: the gold digger struck gold. - Yeah, it's about time we got a seat on the gravy train too! - You said it, sister! But Omitsu, you're doing all right for yourself. You've almost saved ¥ 10 million. - That's enough to open a beauty salon. - I'm not quite there yet. Hogwash! You've had enough money for a while. Isn't that right, Masako? - Isn't he that boy toy, Makoto? - It looks like he's got a date. He's the songwriter Shibayama. I guess the rumors that he's gay are true. - He's got an attitude. - You better believe it. - I hate the type. - Me, too. I'm stuffed, I couldn't eat another bite. Oh, that really burns me! I paid top dollar for these shoes. Lend me a hand. Gee, you're heavy. Hold on tight. Hurry up, everyone's staring at you. - My treat at the next place. - Of course you will. Sorry I'm messing up your kimono. - You're heavy, hurry. - No, I'm not... NIGHT OF THE FELINES Turkish Paradise Screenplay: Kensho Nakano Starring: Hidemi Hara, Keiko Maki, Tomoko Katsura & Ken Yoshizawa Directed by Noboru Tanaka Are you done? You’ll never change. Leave it off! I've got a new neighbor. They're at it every day. And you watch everyday? Why don't you use your hands? Why should I? Yeah, whatever. Get out of my way. You want one? They do the same thing everyday. They're like dogs. There's no progress. Maybe you could coach them. You're ready anytime, anyplace. Do it right or not at all. - So you do use your hands after all! - Only at times like these. You're more trouble than you're worth. - You do it right. - Straight up, every time. It's just plain dirty in a chair. Oh, it's you. I left my false eyelashes in. Dammit! I broke a promise by coming here. I'm fed up with my life. I'm in love again. Her name is Chiko. She's really cute and she's loaded too. The Only problem is I've never had sex with a girl before. I'm not sure if I know how. I'm sure You’ll manage. It's not rocket science. Honda, will you come with me? Come with you? With you by my side, I'm sure I could do it. I'm begging you, you're the Only one I can turn to. She's coming to my apartment tomorrow night. She said she's open to premarital sex. Does she understand where you're coming from? Maybe I should give this up. Let's go home by taxi. Hey, are you taking a stroll by yourself? You work a regular job, don't you? When I have to. After last night, I figured you weren't diligent about anything. - No, there are those who depend on me. - You mean Makoto. - No, the monkey on the roof. - What? The monkey. I'II clean your clock. What the hell are you doing? One damn thing after another. Hold tight... Hey, little guy. Have to go to work. OK, honey, let's go. Attack! What a fool! Women are fools; got their brains between their legs. See you around. Oh, I feel great, how about you? Laugh it up! This is a gas! Turkish Paradise - Ma'am, can I take your dishes? - Thanks, hon. - No problem. That girl does a good job for a newbie. Your husband is waiting in the back. - ''My husband,'' what a joke! - Oh, you love it! I told you not to come around here. I know - it's an emergency. - An emergency. You need money. - You're learning. Cut the crap! After three years together, I can read you like a cheap paperback. I need your help - ¥20,000. No way, it’ll just end up in the barkeeper's pocket. First and third. Missed it by a nose. Miss it by a nose or a nose hair, it's all the same. Still, I have to make good on this debt by tomorrow afternoon. I need your help. Asshole! Drop dead, you creep! - Good evening, sir. - Is Masako here? Yes, she's available now... Akemi, call Masako. Masako, customer waiting! Hey, handsome, glad you could make it. You're doing well, I trust. Well, enough of the small talk, time's a wastin'. Please enjoy yourself. - Akemi, you have to start getting some regular customers too. - Yes, sir. - You can do it! Hurry up, already. I have to catch the last Bullet Train back home. - Rushing back already? - Yep. Hurry on over, I need some lovin'. Ouch! You're Only supposed to put in one finger at a time. You gotta cut me some slack, baby. It ain't gonna kill ya. God, you're beautiful. Every time I see you I think so. - What's so funny? - It's nothing. - You're a strange girl. - Did you just come here to wash my back? That's right: if I don't wash your back at least once a week, I can't sleep well. - Why don't you move to Osaka? - I like Tokyo, or rather, I like Shinjuku. I can't do anything about that. What did I do to make you want to stay away from Osaka? OK, turn around. Stand up, Please. Lift your leg. Kitamura, what a surprise - the department chief at Goi Trading Company, running a noodle shop. You can be an office jockey forever. Here's your miso ramen. It must be good to be working away from a desk. I don't think I could make the transition. Anyone can do it. You just have to be willing to take the plunge. You're probably right. Oh, I forgot. I've got my neck on the chopping block here. You've got it hard, too, hooked up with a freeloader like Ken. You gotta strip too. You've got a dynamite body. Stop! - You're too good for him. - I have to check if the bath is warm enough. I didn't come for a bath. Please! I heard you're a master in bed. Use your skills to Please me. Turn around - you're too far away. - Mitsue, a gentleman to see you. - Coming! I'm Aono from the deposits division of the Kanto Bank. I was sent here by the branch manager. I don't know much about this service. In fact, this is the first time for me. The branch manager noticed that the savings account of one Mitsue Kihara has remained stuck... at ¥9.5 million for some time and sent me here, to see if there is any problem. So... - You like these? - Yeah, well... - Close your eyes. Open your mouth. Don't bite. Hold it in your mouth and suck. You're as good as they say... but I'm no slacker myself. We’ll make a bet: the first one to make a sound loses. If I lose, I'II pay you ¥100,000... but if you lose, I don't pay a dime. Deal? What about this? - Can you do this? - Piece of cake. Watch closely, I'm going to line them up... ¥100, ¥10, ¥100, ¥10. If I couldn't do simple tricks like this, I'd be out of a job. Just look at the time. Take care. Don't catch cold. - I almost forgot the most important thing. - That's right. Gotta go! The chocolate was great and you've got some impressive parlor tricks. Practice makes perfect. Just like the banker's abacus. I guess you're right. I'II be back. - Next time I'II specifically request to be sent to see you. - Come anytime. Oh, I forgot. You should deposit a bit more money in your account. - I'II think about it. - Please give the matter careful thought. If you don't, the bank manager will be very displeased: I'm expensing this visit to the bath. - Thank you. - Thank you. - I'II be back. - Come again. OK, that's a wrap. Let's pack up. Good work. That looked painful. Settle down. I'm scared. You’ll be fine. It's not that big of a Deal. I've got a cut. Hey there, I finally made it. Make yourself at home. It's romantic. It's a little bright in here. You're right. Don't stare. Makoto! Chiko! Makoto, I love you. Chiko! Be gentle. - Makoto.! - Chiko.! - Chiko! - I love you! - Chiko! Stop! No, it's OK. What's wrong? What's the matter? I can't do it! It's no good! Who are you? - Chiko, I can explain... - You invited him?! What nerve! It's finished. She's not coming back. Don't give up so easily. I've had enough. No, you haven't. You’ll get back together with her one way or another. She's a good catch. It’ll work out, don't worry. Don't ever leave me. I'd die without you. He seems to like you. You seem to have a lot of time on your hands. Let's go for a walk. Not here. Will you sleep with Makoto? He's in love with a girl, but he's never had sex with one before. No way. What's the difference? Makoto, my little finger, it's the same thing. - I don't see it that way. - Just sleep with the guy. Why do you Hold it upside down? It's a waste. Rain is valuable. That's why I catch it. Did it hurt? It hurt. In that case, I'II have sex with him. For you. Hey, what are you doing? Raise your arms. It feels good, doesn't it? - Sweet girl. - Just relax. Honda... You did it. What are you crying about? What are you doing here all by yourself? Don't worry about it. Anyhow, I managed to do it. - Do what? - Have sex! Let's talk for a minute. If you have something to say, just spit it out. I heard you slept with a member of the gang. He was a customer. You dumb bitch! So, where's the money? I bet you went off and spent it at a club or something. Who the hell do you think you're talking to? You've never worked a day in your life, and all you do is go out and spend money. I'II tell you something, I'II sleep with whoever I want and go out whenever I want. I'm proud of what I do for living. I've had enough of dating you. Go home. Fine, I'II go. But You’ll regret this decision. What do I have to regret? Crumbs like you are a dime a dozen. Piss off, then! Get out of my way! You creep! Go off somewhere and die! Bastard! Are you OK? Everybody's crying today. Let's have a round. I'm buying. Sake. You all seem to be having quite a time tonight. It's a gas. - When did you start working here? - The day before yesterday. - She's new at our place, too. - Pleased to meet you. Why don't you come around to our joint sometime? We’ll take good care of you. I'd be honored! Just what are you up to? Nothing, I was just teasing him. I thought we were finished. Then she called me and said she'd be willing to meet again. I hope You’ll come too. Bad idea. If she sees me there again, You’ll probably lose her. I know that, but I'm no good alone. Pull yourself together for once. You did it yesterday. You don't have to be so cold. Fine, then. I'II wait in the café downstairs. After you do it, give me a call. Oh, thank you. That's why I love you. I'll give it 110%! Makoto, stop dawdling! Be careful: last time you bit my lip. - Makoto! - Chiko! - Makoto! - Chiko! Makoto... What's wrong? - The music. - Don't go! Keep going. What's wrong? Honda, I failed again! A Treatment for Epilepsy.!.! - Chiko... - Goodbye. I'm never coming here again. Please don't go, I can't live without you! I don't care! Chiko, wait! I told you I can't stand to be alone. I'm tired... - Welcome back. - Hey, is Masako in? - Masako! - Masako! Hurry up, baby cakes! You need practice taking your clothes off. - I forgot, just one finger. - That's right. Oh, you're a dreamboat, but I gotta hurry. 'Time is money', as they say. Maybe I will go to Osaka after all. - Are you joking? - No, I'm serious. You're pulling my leg. Well, then, I'II rent you an apartment. When are you coming? - Anytime. Even tonight. - That's a bit sudden! You're going to quit once you save ¥ 10 million? I don't recommend it. Working a Turkish bath is an important job. You've honed talents unique to your industry. You're a technician of sorts. I have an account with another bank too. No, that's no good! How much do you have squirreled away at this second bank? - You won't tell anyone? - Of course not. Almost ¥4 million. ¥4 million? That's a total of ¥13.5 million. Impressive! - You could buy a plot of land with that money. - Land? Sure. I want to help you. There's a place that just came onto the market in Setagaya. They're asking ¥ 15 million for it, but I think I can talk them down to 13. Quite a bargain, in my opinion. - Come on, short red. I got it! - Pure luck. What's wrong, Omitsu? You're all antsy. - Actually, I was thinking about quitting. - Huh? Then, what... Quiet! I bought a place in Setagaya. Well, it's about time. He's coming tonight - to make my dreams come true. So, you're quitting the bank? You've got more chutzpah than I thought. I saw you and I figured I could make a go of it, too. You told me, ''You just have to be willing to take the plunge.'' You were right. I feel like lady luck is smiling on me. I'm saying goodbye to this neighborhood tonight. In that case, let's drink to your new life. - Here's to leaving the office behind. - Here's to leaving Shinjuku behind. I can't believe it: Omitsu's getting married. What are you talking about? That's not what I'm doing, but he is really sweet! Masako, there's a customer for you. Who is it? Your customer. What's with the long face? I'm a customer. Please come with me. This place has great service. Everyone's polite, kind, and full of smiles. Please come this way. Makoto's dead. He died. He tumbled to the ground, like an umbrella. Hold me... Please... take me. Feel better now? What are you going to do, Omitsu? It's almost dawn. Dammit, that banker screwed me! He's got every last penny. Nothing ever changes. No, things are a little different. God, I'm tired. Come on, stand up. Don't fall asleep. Look: it's morning. I'II see you later! THE END TransIated by scannon & kozue Timing by Iordretsudo
