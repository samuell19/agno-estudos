Oh, Peter, come in. - Swing heil, Joseph. - Swing heil. Ow! Oh ho ho! Aah! Anna, we have to dance tonight. - OK. - There they are. OK, OK, you've got Shaw... - Hey! - The Clambake 7... - Herr Hitman. Otto. - Peter. - What's doing, you reefed-up... - Thomas. Try to understand this. Dorsey's trumpet is great when he's playing sweet. Sweet. But he doesn't ride, man. Do you understand? Let's work tonight! Yeah! Aah! Whoo! Thomas, come and dance. What do you say? - Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! Yeah! Yeah! Whoo! Whoo! Thomas, we'll miss the tram. - Take it slow, Otto. - See you, Otto. What, you didn't like Helga? You know Herr Hitman seemed to hit it off with her. What? I did not. I was just being nice. "I was just being nice." Hell, we've already missed it. We're walking again. You want to race down to Macken Bridge? No, let's just walk. - Well, I beat you last time. - That's not true. That is true. I believe I beat you right... I beat you last time. I believe I beat you right down to your socks. Go! Last one on's an H.J. pansy! Hey! Peter! Thomas! Damn it. Aah! - We're gangsters. - We're cowboys. You're idiots. Arvid. Oh, come on, Herr Hitman. We love you. Leave me alone. You didn't have to wait for me. I can take care of myself. Ooh. Oh, you think it's funny? - Yes, please. - Aha! All right. Come on. I have to unload. En garde. Try it. Come on, try. You can't... When I was kid 'bout half past three My daddy said, son, come here to me Said things may come, and things may go But this is one thing you ought to know Tain't what you do It's the way that you do it Tain't what you do It's the way that you do it Tain't what you do It's the way that you do it That's what gets me through Ma ma ma my On the floor! Stop! - Stop where you are now! What the hell? Peter! Stop there! - Are you all right? - I'm OK. Gestapo. Watch out. Hold it! Don't let him get away! Get to the other side! Stop there! Aah! Peter, let's get out of here. Come on, come on. Come on, let's go. - Morning, Mama. - Morning. - Morning, Mama Klara. - Good morning, boys. What happened to your face? I was trying a new dance step, and I fell. Who were you fighting with? Mama, I wasn't fighting. I was dancing. You told me you wouldn't become part of something dangerous. I fell. It's a wild dance. Here, let me show you. No, no, no. Not on me, you don't. Over the... boom. Into the back. Ah. Ah. Mmm. Ow. Ow. Ow. Mmm. Looks to me like you have to go to the bathroom. Mama Klara, no! Oh, that butter has to last us a whole month. It's not for you to gorge yourself on. Oh, I'm so glad you're all amused. - I'm off. - Peter. Mama. Peter... maybe Thomas's parents are so well-placed... they don't care what kind of trouble he gets into... but if you lose your place in school... you'll end up working at the factory like me. Mama, I'm going to university. I'm going to be an engineer. There's a great need for engineers now. The Nazis don't get everyone, Thomas. I'm telling you, he never had a chance. Here, let me give you a bag. Let me help you. I got it. I'm fine. What did I tell you? At least he tried to escape. He didn't just wait for them. - Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. Gestapo. Let's go. Come on. Hey, they haven't caught us, have they? Well, they will. We got out of the H.J., but we won't get out of the army. Nobody gets out of it. Hey! Willi. Peter, what's your brother doing here? Come here. What are you following us for? I can be sleazy. Just give me a chance. We don't need some pink-eared midget hanging around. Go home to Mama. A couple of H.J.'s are beating up a swing boy... in the alley around the corner. You better not be lying. In here. In here. - They were beating him up. How many were there? Playing cowboys and Indians? Can we play, too? What's the matter? Four against five. That's still not a fair fight. There's five. Let me fight. I can fight. Willi, go home. What about one against one, swing heine? Aah! What are you, a kike lover? Thomas. He's Jewish. Thank you. Thank you. You keep helping them, and we'll deal with you... the way we deal with all traitors. I'm not a traitor! I'm a cowboy, and you're a pansy! Get out of here! I'm going to get you, swing boy! Looked like a swing boy to me. How was I supposed to know? Come on, Willi. We'll be late for school. Swing boy. Hey, Peter! Thomas! Quiz time. What is an icky? Someone who's stupid, not hip. Can't collar that jive. - Jive? - Talk. What they say in Harlem. Too easy. Um, faust. Oh, a book by Goethe. - Icky. - Even as we speak, two ickies. - Icky, icky, icky, icky! - A faust is an ugly girl. Like that faust you went for at the Bismarck the other night. Boys, could you go for these? Ooh. Ooh, I like these. Look at those breasts. - Otto, where did you get these? - I got 'em. What would you call that? Cupcake size? Cantaloupe. Ooh, look what we have here. Peter's priss. - Have you talked with her yet? - Who said I'm interested? Your tongue was on the floor. Didn't we see you pigeons... at the Cafe Bismarck the other night? We wouldn't be caught dead there. Especially not with you, Thomas Berger. Ooh! - Well, you missed it. - Why? What's so great about it? Well, it was the swingingest party ever. - Right, Peter? - Swingingest. Supermergentroid. Super what? Come on, Evey. They talk gibberish. No. It's a secret language we're not allowed to know. It's all too secret. Ha ha! You go to my head And you linger like a haunting refrain And I find you spinning round in my brain Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne What did you do today? Did you and Thomas go down to the docks? Yeah. We went down there after school... but no new records came in. So, what are we doing tomorrow? Are we going to go to the Hall Club? Willi. I saw you looking at me. You can't deny it. What are you doing? Don't touch her! - Mama! - Goddamn you! Leave him alone! No, don't! Peter! No! Peter, no! Don't! Don't! No! I'm all right. I'm all right. Herr Hinz was just leaving. I thought a woman of your special background... would value my protection. Your boy needs a haircut. - That's our business. - Perhaps not. We have nothing to fear. For six years, I've proven my loyalty. The new order demands absolute loyalty. Youth of his sort belong in a work camp. Good night. Herr Hinz, wait. Please, wait. - Who are you expecting? - No one. Peter, tell whoever it is to go away. - Mama. - Do what I tell you. Good evening. Is Frau Muller at home? Who is it? - Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. Who are you? I am the block leader. I was collecting for the relief. May I be of some service? No. You may go. May I help you? - Frau Muller? - Yes. I'm so sorry to disturb you. I'm Herr Knopp. Are you all right? Yes, it's nothing. - Are you going to take my mama? - Willi, it's all right. No one is going to take away your mother, young man. Though with so beautiful a lady it is quite tempting. But really, you should see to that cut. You have some iodine? - Please allow me. - It's not necessary. - He's in the Gestapo. - Don't worry. It's all right. We've done nothing wrong. Just be quiet. I've found it. Please sit down. Let me... let me see. Now, this will only sting for a moment. Ah, yes. There. There. That didn't hurt too much, did it? - It should heal in no time. - Thank you. Uh, I can see you're wondering. Regrettably, I am here on official business... but I hope that we can conclude that as quickly as possible. Do you know a Karl Manglesdorf? I did... a long time ago. He was an associate of my husband's. Mmm. Then you have not seen him recently? No. The last time was probably six years ago... before my husband passed away. Oh, I am so sorry. What has he done? Oh, it is unimportant. Uh, have any other of your husband's associates... tried to contact you? No. Since his death I've had nothing to do... with any of his friends. I took a job at the Farben factory... and have devoted myself to the reich and my children. Well, you have raised two fine sons. I see the resemblance. Or is it just a family proclivity... for facial abrasions? Do you have news of my son? Excuse her. She's not feeling well. Wilhelm is dead, Mama. Dear lady, it is I who must excuse myself. I have all the information I need. So, if anything else occurs to you... or if I can help in any way, any way at all... please. - Good night. - Good night. - Here. - Oh, thank you. Good night. When I was a kid about half past three My daddy said, son, come here to me He says, things may come, and things may go But this is one thing you ought to know Tain't... Was Papa a Communist? What? Where did you get that idea? I don't know. I mean, isn't that why they arrested him? He wasn't a Communist. Then what'd he do? Do you think I know everything? It was six years ago, Willi. I don't remember. Well, you remember more than I do. I was only three. I remember they took him away... and then he came back after a long time... and he was sick. So? Did they make him sick in prison? I don't know. Go to sleep. I have to work in the morning. But he loved us... didn't he? - Ah, Peter. - Herr Schumler. Make sure you don't take any side trips. I can't afford to keep my older customers waiting. They're the only ones who read anymore. Everyone else is too busy going to parades. Yes, Herr Schumler. Don't you need the addresses? Distracted today. Nasty bruise. What happened? Good morning. I'm looking for a rare edition of Faust. Wait one second. I think I have just the thing. Peter, here it is. Just terrible. "Traitor." I'm taking the radio. I want that bureau as well. I'll be back for it. This one? Delivery from Herr Schumler. - Frau Linge? - Yes. The book for my mother. She's bedridden. How very kind of Herr Schumler to send it. Thank you. That's Beethoven... Piano Trio in B Flat Major. Are you a student of classical music? No. My father... I think he's the violinist. Wilhelm Muller? Really? He was a great musician. You must be very proud. Well... good-bye. Good-bye. Ah, I found it. - You can use the booth. - What? I'm finished with the booth. You can use it. Can I help you find anything? I know this store like it's my own private collection. No. Thanks. OK. - That's the best. - Isn't Benny Goodman the best? That is... this is Benny Goodman. - No, it's Gene... - Oh, no, Gene Krupa is... Benny's illegal, so they relabel all these jackets... to get them by the censor. The authorities don't know. It takes them forever to catch on. You know, they haven't banned Arshawsky yet... Artie Shaw... and he's Jewish. - Mm-hmm. - And Count Basie. You can still get Count Basie. He's a negro. Hmm. They probably think he's the head of a country. You don't know anything about swing, do you? Of course I do. Just not a lot. Come here. Get ready. You're about to really blow your wig. Well, I should just... Let me... I'll close the... door. That's Bunny Berigan on trumpet. Actually, it's Pee Wee Erwin. Maybe it's Ziggy Elman. I thought you knew everything about swing. - Ah! - Aah! Ah, what a burn! He's just got the greatest solid send of jive. He just swings it out. It's... - Supermergentroid. - Yeah. - Do you jitterbug? - No. Do you want to learn? I just... It's easy, and I could teach you. Anyone can do it. You can't listen to this and not dance. It just sends you. Yeah! Muller. Yeah! Yeah! Muller. Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Muller! This isn't one of your dancing clubs. What? This isn't one of your dancing clubs. We were... we were just listening. What about buying? I don't know why I bother stocking those swing records. They are more trouble than they are worth. I'll buy it. All right, you hep cats. Get ready to jump up and down. Here's one of your own who can really break it down. Herr Hitman meets Count Basie. Yeah! Herr Django, man! Shout and feel it Shout and feel it Shout and feel it It's sounding hot tonight. Go ahead! Take it! - Bop, bop! - Hey! - Ha! - Ha! What? One, two... The H.J.s are coming! Hurry up! Oh, scheiss patrol. - Killer diller, man. - You were great. Thanks, Helga. - Murderistic, Herr Hitman. - Thanks. Look at those pansies. They're all training for the Gestapo. How did they know we were here tonight? Probably beat it out of some swing kid. - That's Emil. - Where? So, it's true. Goddamn traitor. He was probably forced into it. It is compulsory, after all. Oh, some excuse. Those creeps are too busy marching up and down all day... to keep track. Arvid's right. Emil couldn't be a traitor. He was the original hep cat. No. No one who likes swing can become a Nazi. Aw, who needs him anyway? Come on, let's have some fun. - Keep that blindfold on. - Blindfold's on. I'm sorry, Otto. I grooved this platter from the first lick. Harlem. Recorded September 14, 1937. Teddy Foster, trumpet. Freddy Gardner, alto... Hey! You guys are not going to believe what just happened. This H.J. rode by me and whistled the signal. This H.J. rode by me and whistled It Don't Mean a Thing. - You're joking. - He must've been a hep cat. It's like Herr Hitman said. A hep cat can't be broken. No. What if he learned it from Emil? You know, he might have been trying to trick you... into telling him where the next party is. Come on. It took you a year to learn how to whistle that. Well, what's that supposed to mean? It means what it means. Quiz time. "Joint is jumping." Um, what it isn't in here... lively. Can't we find something a little more exciting to do? I say we go down to the red light district. Make some new friends. Yeah. I could go for some ladies. Those kinds of friends cost a lot of money. Actually, I was thinking about... using some of that dough you've got stashed away. Oh, no. I'm saving that money for the shortwave radio. I'm not going to spend that money on some tart. That's because even if you paid her, you couldn't get one. Maybe the reason you're so bored... is because you just don't have any idea... which platters to pick. All right. Put on that blindfold. - What? - Put it on. I see. We go right into it. Come on. Come on, Thomas. Pick any record in the room... any record. OK. I believe I hear activity over in the Gene Krupa section. I think that could be. I'm waiting. I'm waiting. No, no. It's too easy. - I'm sorry. My hand slipped. - You did that on purpose. Don't be an ass. I'm sorry, OK? I'll replace it. You will? From where? Alberti doesn't have anything left. I got to go down to the docks. Besides, you have absolutely no idea what to look for. Oh, well, I'm sorry I'm not as smart as you. You know, the only reason you know all these hits... is because you can't dance to them. Thomas. Get out. Get out! Arvid, it was a mistake. His hand slipped. Why do you always have to go along with his stupid jokes? I'm not going along. It was an accident, Arvid. - Get out of here... everybody. - Why make so much of it? This is my hot club, and I want you all to get out! Arvid. - Go! OK. To hell with you. Just sit around here all day with your records whacking off. OK? Come on, Peter. You shouldn't have said that thing... about him not being able to dance, Thomas. Why not? It's true. I'm sick of him acting like he's smarter... than everybody else all the time. Look at that son of a bitch. They all think they can get away with whatever they want. He stole that radio from someone they arrested. I saw him give it to this tart. What if we lifted it? Next time he comes in for his hot loaves... he gets the cold shoulder instead. Yeah. We could give it to Arvid. Pick up Benny live. Yeah. Can you imagine the look on that little creep's face... when we walk in with it? What do we do? Aah! Ohh! Fraulein. Fraulein. - Help me. Help me. - Oh! I'm bleeding! A gang of H.J.s stabbed me. Help me! I'm bleeding! I'm bleeding! Get a doctor! I don't want to die! - Oh, my God! - Aah! Aah! Aah! They hurt me so badly. No, no. Wait there. Wait, please. Don't leave me! Wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, no! No! Let go! Hey! What are you doing there? Help! He stole my radio! Aah! - Ha ha ha! Help! Damn, pounders. You must stop them! They stole my radio! - Help! - Hey, stop! Hey, hey, stop! Hey! Stop! - Move! - Go! Go! Move! Hey, you! Stop! Stop! - Unh! - Unh! Stop that truck! Come on, Peter! Give me your hand! Come on! They're right behind us! Come on! - Come on, Peter! - I can't! Peter, drop the radio! Drop it! Drop the damn thing! - No! Come on! - Leave it! Damn! Peter! Thomas. Where are you taking me? Home. Does my mother know? I think so. She's the one who called me. Lucky for you she did... otherwise, you could be on your way... to a juvenile home or worse by now. I don't care. However small your concern may be for your own well-being... you might want to consider that there are others... who might be endangered by your recklessness. What do I have to do? Only the same as most boys your age are doing. I've informed the local H.J. commander of your situation. I'm not joining the H.J. Well, of course. It's your decision. I'm just trying to help. I don't want your help. You know, Peter... you may not believe this... but I was once very much like you. I know how confusing things can seem... when a young boy loses his father. Mine died when I was only nine... in the war. I couldn't understand it. I blamed everyone, including myself. I dropped out of school, left home... drifted from one job to the next. Then one day... I heard a man speak in Munich. I felt somehow he was speaking directly to me. Somehow, he understood the helplessness I felt... the yearnings I had. That day, I learned I was not alone. And while I'd been helpless to save my father... there was still much I could do... to help save something far greater... the fatherland. You don't have to be alone, Peter. Are you all right? I'm sorry, Mama. I'm supposed to join the H.J. Then you must. It was a mistake to allow you not to join in the first place. I just couldn't bear to see you in that uniform. But you have to think of your future. They're pigs, Mama. I've told you. You must learn to steel yourself. You cannot let your feelings overcome you. I won't join. Do you want them to start watching the house again? Do you remember what it was like... all of us jumping at every knock? I'd rather die than go through that again. He's always giving instructions. Hey, swing boy! Thomas? Ha ha ha! What are you doing here? Did you think I'd let you have all this fun by yourself? This is not going to be fun. You shouldn't have done this. Well, you'd have done the same thing. We can't let them split us apart. Anyway, think about it. It's the perfect cover... H.J. by day, swing kids by night. You look ridiculous. Come on. The German people once again rest easy... that there is nothing to fear from within. But let them not rest too easy. Like a plague, the Jewish infestation... stays ready to strike a death blow... to the heart of Germany's resurgence. The Jew cares nothing for Germany. From early childhood, its young are taught... to follow the lead of the Jewish elders... whose stranglehold on the world's economy... Germany has only now started to break. Flat foot floogee with the floy floy Flat foot floogee with the floy floy Flat foot floogee with the floy floy Floy doy, floy doy, floy doy Ha ha. Don't let us interrupt you, swing boy. Keep dancing. Hey, what you got there? Oh, Benny Goodman. Aah! I was right about you. You're just a bunch of Jew lovers. No! You call us pansies. Even my girlfriend doesn't wear her hair that long. Aah! Uhh! A cripple, too. Pick him up! Unh. What's your name? Django Reinhardt. Unh! Your name. Duke Ellington. I know his name. Emil. Unh! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Unh. Unh. Aah! Let's hear you play that nigger kike music now. Aah! - Oh, no! - Arvid, it's all right. - Hey. - Arvid, it's Peter and Thomas. Calm down. - Arvid, it's OK! Calm down. It's OK. - It's OK. - No! - Leave that alone. - Leave me alone! He said I'd never play again. But he forgot about Django. Django Reinhardt played with two fingers. So can I. See? They look just like his. He didn't need these two fingers. Who did this to you? Who said you'd never play again? Schaufuhrer Lutz was the boxing champion... this year in your division... and he will be instructing you in the basic techniques. I'll leave you to it. Yes, bannfuhrer. Will someone volunteer to demonstrate... or do I have to pick? I'll volunteer. Good. I'm glad to see a new recruit so eager. Heh heh. Let's see how you do when you're not fighting a cripple. Keep your punches close to your shoulder... otherwise, you leave yourself unprotected. Attacking your opponent's body will bring his hands down... Uhh! making his head more vulnerable. Whoo! Good one, good one. Never be caught against the ropes. Thank you, Herr Berger. You've been most helpful. Go to hell, traitor. I am not a traitor. I just wised up. You will, too. We'll need another volunteer to help me demonstrate... Schaufuhrer, watch out! Go, Thomas, go! Go! That's it! Get off the ropes, Thomas. Come on, Thomas! Out of his way! Move! Come on! Emil. Stop it! - Enough? - No! - Uhh! - Stop! Come on! Come on! You proved your point, Thomas. Enough? Uhh! Just stay down. Emil! Emil, that's enough. That's enough! You all right? Thomas... Lesson's over, swing heine. Hey! It don't mean a thing If it ain't got that swing Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah Doo wah, doo wah, doo waaaah Yeah, swingin' Aw, yeah, man It don't mean a thing If it ain't got the swing... Pow, pow, pow! Three to the stomach. Thomas won't go down. The tables turn. Doof, doof, doof, doof, doof! Right to the fa... you have to see Emil. - Emil's face is bent sideways. - You look pretty bad yourself. Thanks. It was murderistic. I can't. They smell your breath. Well, maybe we shouldn't play this music. They might listen to your ears. So, what's it like anyway, the H. J? - Oh, it's... - It's stupid as hell. All we do is memorize... the fuhrer's period of struggle and all this other stuff. Almost as boring as it is here. You don't have to be here. Don't you have some marching to do? We didn't want to join. We had to. He had to. What's your excuse? Well, I'm his friend. So am I. You don't see me joining. No. They wouldn't accept you. Come. Arvid, you'll never guess what I found. I was over at Silke's house, and... Oh. Hi. - Hi, Helga. Come on in. - Hi. What's the matter? Everyone in here looks sadder than a map. When did she become a member? If we can let H.J.s in, we can let her in. What is that? I went after Emil because of what he did... and all the thanks I get is a bunch of superior remarks? I never asked you to fight him. What's the matter with you? Emil almost killed you. So we're even. Now we can all be friends. Oh, you're fitting right in... listening to the same songs... wearing the same clothes, getting into the same fights. It's almost like being a swing kid, isn't it? Though if you never liked the music to begin with... I guess there's no difference. - All right, you bastard. - You want to start something? You like that, don't you? Take a swing at me! - Come on! - Do it! Do it! Let go! Arvid. Leave it. That's enough. Damn it, Arvid. What's the matter with you? What do you want us to do? He joined because of me. Because of me. If anyone's changed around here, it's you. - No. I haven't changed. - Yes, you have. You sit in here all day. You never go out with us anymore. There's a party at the Trichter tonight. Arvid? Well, we have to practice. Hitler's a madman. He's trying to get us into a war with the whole world. The army will put a stop to that. Oh, tch. We must rely on the army. I wish you would stop talking politics. What do doctors know of such things? My father always said, a man with a family... shouldn't even think about politics. When did your father ever think about anything? Who's there? Thomas, is that you? - Thomas? - Yes, Papa. Well, come in and say hello to our guests. Thomas, what happened to your face? Thomas, you remember Dr. and Frau Keppler. - They're here from Berlin. - Dietrich. Perhaps I had better get my bag. Thomas, you haven't said hello yet. Hello, Dr. Keppler, Frau Keppler. - Dietrich, for God's sake. - I'm all right, Mama. He's more than all right. He's in his element. This is exactly what I'm talking about. But they all look wonderful in their uniforms, don't they? Our little Adolphi is no fool. Is that why you voted for him? You don't know the first thing about it. Now go upstairs and get cleaned up. I suppose if I think about my family... I should hope that the Nazis stay in power forever. With them in charge, even a misfit like Thomas... might have a chance to make something of himself. - Hey! - How you doing? Peter, Thomas. - Good to see you again. - Swing heil. Have fun. Swing heil. Yeah! Sabina, let's jitterbug. Up you go. Go, Thomas! You're the king of Harlem! Swing line! Come on, everybody! Back up, back up! Swing line! Swing heil! Let's go, hepcats. Come on, that's the way to swing! Go! Go! Go! Come on! How do I look? Like gold. Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Yeah! Quiet! Quiet! Stop! We are closing this club! We are closing this club! You must leave immediately! You must give your names at the door! Leave immediately! - What do we do? - It's OK. It's OK. Oh, my God! Come on. Where's Thomas? Pete, it's me! I'm on your side. Goddamn them! - No! - We're H.J.s. If we get caught here, we're dead. Come on, out the back. The alley. - Come on, come on! - Leave her alone! We'll be all right. No! Down the stairs. Let's go. Heil Hitler. That is the Jews’ trick. The Jew wants you to look at him as just another person. But he does not look at you that way. He is your enemy. Do you know why? Because you are superior to him. You are special. You belong to something special. He is your brother. All of you are brothers. The same blood runs through your veins... the blood of the greatest race on the face of this earth. Berger. I just wanted to say that... I guess I still have something to learn about boxing. You showed me that strength of spirit... can be just as powerful as technical skills. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Look what we have done in just six short years. Every day you must carry it with you... the knowledge of who you are. You will carry it with you. Yes! - All right! - Nice! All right. Great. Absolutely great. Ah. Peter. Good. I wanted to have a word with you. Please. - We'll go in a moment. - Yes, sir. - Where are we going? - Oh, nowhere. I just wanted to tell you... that the reports on your progress have been very good. Your training sits well on you. - How do you feel? - Fine. I feel very well. I'm most gratified. I knew you would take to it. I was also thinking about your grandmother. Maybe what you all need is a trip to the country. The strength through joy movement... provides these vacations, you know. I could submit an application. What do you think? Good. Then I will arrange for it. Thank you. It's my pleasure. That's everything. I just wanted to tell you how pleased I am... and keep up the good work. Oh, I almost forgot. Uh, there's one more thing. I think it would be wise... if you stopped working for that bookseller. - What's his name? - Herr Schumler. What has he done? - What did you do for him? - I just delivered books. Didn't it seem at all strange to you? Don't most people come to pick out books for themselves? It was for old people who couldn't go out. How did you know they were just books? Did you ever open them? It's better to know... what you're agreeing to, Peter... before you become part of something. It was just a job. We need the money. Of course. However... if you did go back and check... and it turns out that there's nothing... well, then, you might help to clear him. Of course, you mustn't let him know. You keep up the good work. I have great hopes for you. Well, good night. Good night. Ah, Peter. I've been wondering about you. Herr Schumler. Your mother told me... that you wouldn't be coming to me for a few weeks... but I was beginning to think... you were never coming back. - I have time again. - Really? Don't they keep you very busy with all those activities... and competitions? I don't always have to go... and I don't always go even if I have to. Well, I don't have any for you today, but when I do... Thank you. Peter? Excuse me. Can you watch the store for a moment? Oh, yes, we just got one in. I assure you... Then we have no choice. Forgeries. No, no. Don't come here. I understand, of course. Year and date of birth. Why? I have my messenger boy here. I can send it right over to you. It's my pleasure. I hope you both... will be feeling better soon. Good-bye. Peter? You're in luck, Peter. I have a delivery for you. Ah, Peter. Thank you. Is she feeling better, your mother? I'm afraid she's in the hospital, but this will help. Would you like to come in? Have some tea? Perhaps talk about music? I'll just put the kettle on and get another cup. Do you play? - No. - Never? I don't anymore. I used to. Why not? I wasn't any good. I doubt that. The tea will be ready in a minute. Who is this? That was my husband. Do you recognize him? He was a student of your father's. His name was Carl Bohlgren. After he was killed, I changed back to my maiden name. It was safer. Ah, the tea. We just heard he'd given a speech at the university... after the expulsion of all the Jewish professors. Did you know my father? No, unfortunately. I met my husband while he was studying in Berlin. We didn't move here until after your father's death. He was a brave man. Maybe. Why do you say that? Well, he had to know what they would do, what would happen. The Jews weren't his problem. Maybe he didn't see them solely as Jews... but fellow human beings and colleagues... who were being unjustly persecuted. And what did they ever do for him? - Maybe they were just using him. - Who told you that? No one. It just makes sense. They probably deserved to be expelled. Peter, they didn't do anything. Well, I don't know that. How do you know? They were expelled. They must have done something. I'm sure it's all been very difficult for you. If your father could... My father left us without anything... and my mother had to go work in a factory. Don't tell me about things that I know! I have to go now. It's better to know what you're agreeing to, Peter. Peter, they didn't do anything. Maybe they were just using him. How did you know they were just books? They must have done something! You must learn to steel yourself. You cannot let your feelings overcome you. OK, swing boy, you're dead! Aah! I had you pissing in your pants. - Damn it, Thomas! - Hey. You can be a real bastard sometimes! Hey, relax. It was a joke. - It wasn't funny! - All right, I'm sorry. - Calm down. I'm sorry. - All right. I was just riding by. Just... Do you want to know what I was riding by on? Look. It's mine. Where did you get it? Emil got me into the motorized H.J. They just gave it to me. Can you believe that? I know it doesn't look like much, but it can really fly. You want to take a spin? No. Not right now. It's been like I said, hasn't it? We have it both ways. What could be better? I don't know. There's nothing to know. It's easy. We just play along, we get whatever we want. I know, Thomas. Did they tell you to talk to me? What? Did they tell you to talk to me? What's the matter with you? What did you say that for? Are you losing... what did you say that for? You've just been listening to Arvid too much. You know, Arvid looks at everything backwards. He's a weirdo. Yeah, maybe. No, not maybe. Definitely. Come on. Just once around the block. No. Some other time. Really. All right. Hey... don't throw yourself in. Herr Kehler, the store owner... is always grousing and complaining... about the lack of raw materials. He said they're being used up by the army... and that this is hurting all the small businessmen. Very good, Stahlecker. Thank you. Berger? I've overheard my father many times... speaking out against the Fuhrer. He says he's a madman who's dragging... the whole country down with him. Did he suggest... any course of action to remedy this? No. My father's too weak. He just talks. Hmm. Talk can spread. Muller? I have nothing to report. Throughout Germany today... there was a feeling of great pride and appreciation... for the Fuhrer's bold action... to ensure the safety of our German brothers... in the Sudetenland. The Czech army offered no resistance... to the overwhelming strength showed by our forces. There have also been numerous reports... of spontaneous celebration by the Czech people. Many poured out into the street to greet our brave soldiers... and to express gratitude and relief for their liberation. Today, a meeting was held... between Foreign Minister Von Ribbentrop... and the president of Czechoslovakia. Von Ribbentrop expressed that in the Fuhrer's words... it should now be clear to all nations... that Germany stands ready to protect... members of the German race... no matter across what border they may live. Yeah! Go, Hitman! He's his old self again. He's supermergentroid... but he still can't play ascending octaves. Ow! Smooth! Hey, fly boy! You have any dog fights yet? No, but we'll get our chance soon enough. Can you imagine that? Just up there flying around. I'd get dizzy. The Luftwaffe would like to request a song... and I want you to play it. Peter, what about it? Wait a minute. Tell them we play what we want to play... and if he doesn't like it, he can go someplace else. You'll go someplace else after tonight... but right now I am paying you, and you will play what I say! Djangoman, let's just play the song. Think of the band. I don't play for money. That's good... because I'll see to it you never play any clubs again! Hey, what's the matter with you? We liked your music. We only wanted to hear one good German song. There are no more German songs, only Nazi songs. Let's just go, Arvid. Wait a second! You want to hear a song for the Fatherland? Play it yourself. Take it. Take it! What's the matter with all of you? Can't you see what's happening? Are you afraid to look? We are murdering Austrians. Next, it will be the Czechs and then the Poles... not to mention the Gypsies and the Jews. It's unmentionable! You think that just because you're not doing it yourself... that you're not a part of it? Well, I'm sick and tired of doing my part! And now you want to hear a song. You need someone to lift your morale! Well, I won't! I won't. Herr Hitman, wait up! - Djangoman... - Arvid! My name is Arvid! Djangoman, Herr Hitman... how could I have been such an idiot? What do you mean? You've been practicing for tonight for weeks. They only wanted to hear one song. It's not just one song or that song! Don't you see? Anytime you go along with them, anytime you try to help them... it just makes it easier! Arvid! What the hell's the matter with you? What was that speech all about, the Jews and the Gypsies? What about the cripples and the retards? You know, that's who you belong with. I would rather belong to anyone... anyone... than belong to the Nazis like you do. That's because you've got everything backwards. You always said I was the stupid one. Nazis go anywhere they want, do anything they please. Everybody gets out of our way! So who's the smart one, eh, Djangoman? You know, if I were you... I wouldn't worry about anybody but myself... because we're coming after you next. Quiz time. "Got your glasses on." What? Means you don't know who your friends are. I can't believe I used to feel sorry for that traitor. You're a real bastard. What the hell's gotten into you? What's gotten into me? Yes, you! What the hell was that all about? - Those things you were saying... - I was saying? I can't believe that was you! You don't really believe all that propaganda, do you? Peter, he's the one who's got his head full of propaganda. Did you hear him? He was actually defending the Jews. But... but Benny is Jewish. Yeah. And see what that music's done to Arvid? It's perverted his brain. Look at him. What? I can't believe this. Arvid's right about you. - Oh, you always take his side. - I'm not taking his side. You always take his side, whether he's right or wrong! Well, he is right! Listen to yourself! You're turning into a fucking Nazi! Oh, so what if I am? Oh, that's right. I'm sorry, I forgot. Your father was a Jew lover, too, wasn't he? Come on! I'll kill you! Peter, stop it! Thomas! - Get your hands off me! - Come on! Let go! Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me... in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me... all the days of my life... and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen. So I sent out my driver... admittedly a mistake, and he brings back... French sausage, Polish wine... and Greek chocolate. Ha ha ha! The delicate matters you must always attend to yourself. I can't remember when we've eaten so well. I don't know how to thank you. It is entirely my pleasure. It's not often that I get to share the hospitality... of such charming company. Thank you. And thank you again for the beautiful radio. We've all been enjoying it so much. Well, I know how fond this family is of music. You've hardly touched your food. I'm all right. Are you sure your mother-in-law wouldn't like to join us? Yes. It's not that. It's just that... none of these rich foods would be good for her. But she's so looking forward to our vacation. Good. To the Reich. To the Reich. Can I have some wine? Willi! Well, surely it wouldn't be terrible... to let him try a little... just this once? All right, now. Just a little. You drink it slowly, son. Uhh! Ha ha ha! Heh heh heh! Peter, won't you join us, please? Have some wine. It's a curative. Keeping the body free of foreign elements... whatever they might be... is the central principle in our Fuhrer's "Weltanschauung." Drink makes us weak. Strength comes from purity. Well, it's gratifying to know that the Hitler Jugend... is still training their recruits so effectively. If only I was a little younger. I'd have not acquired all these bad habits. Comfort is the curse of age. Everyone in Germany, regardless of age... must aspire to... the highest principles of National Socialism. - Peter, don't be rude. No, no. He's quite right. Go on, son. What else about me do you have objections to? Polish sausage, French wine, Swiss chocolate. I would be more satisfied with just good German fare. And the music! What kind of loyal National Socialist... would listen to anything else? I won't have you talking this way to our guest. You must apologize. Oh, no. No apologies. He has found me out. Well, Peter, you must report me. For surely they would not allow me... to remain at my post if they knew. How I envy the young. For them, everything is so clear. Things seem to be either one way or another. It's only with a little age that you begin to see life... as a series of compromises. But, even in compromising one must draw a line. And I see that I have strayed from duty far enough. Thank you, Peter. It is true what our Fuhrer says. In Germany today, it is our youth who lead the way. Now, regrettably, I must leave. Dear lady, it has been delightful. - You won't stay for the coffee? - Excuse me. No. I must go. - I'll see you to the door. - Thank you. Good night. I don't know what's come over you. He's done so much for you. For us! Herr Hinz, I could understand, but Herr Knopp? He's a good man. Mama, he's a Nazi. And what's wrong with that? The whole country is Nazi. He asked me to spy on Herr Schumler. Then he must have had a reason. I will not have him sitting or sleeping where my father did! Uhh! You want to end up like him? All his great principles. What good did they do us? What good did they do anyone, including him? In the end, he couldn't bear... to look at his own face in the mirror. By the time the Gestapo had finished... he was a hollow little man, willing to say or sign anything to stop the pain! They're gonna take you away, just like they took Papa. Come here. Nobody's going to take me away. Everything's gonna be all right. Besides, I've got you to protect me. And I would. Yes? Gestapo. Where's Dr. Berger? Heil Hitler. Dietrich Berger... you'll come with us for questioning. Questioning? About what? There must be a mistake. No mistake. You'll come with us now. What's happening? You can't just take him with you. Shh, shh, shh. May I get a few things? No, no. You won't be needing anything. You'll be back in the morning. Heil Hitler. Thomas. Deutsche, Deutsche Hitler Jugend. National Socialism... is humanity's greatest experience. Man's salvation is in our hands. And the Hitler Jugend are the guarantors of that future. You are the lifeblood of Germany. Woe to those who do not understand. Three times woe to those who oppose you! Sieg heil! Sieg heil! - Sieg heil! - Sieg heil! - Sieg heil! - Sieg heil! They gave me this great bike. Did Peter tell you about it? It's beautiful. Want to take a look at the knife? Be careful. Did you ever hurt someone with it? No. Hey, where you been? Hi, Peter. I've been waiting for you. Did Mama get back yet? No. Thomas was just showing me his knife. Give it to him. Give him back the knife! Give me the knife. Willi, Peter and I need to talk for a minute. Go on. He's gonna make a fine soldier someday. I hope not. Yeah, well, the way we walked into Czechoslovakia... he'll probably never even have to fight anyone. - What do you want? - Nothing. I just wanted to talk. About what? I'm just worried about the way you've been acting lately. I know Arvid's death shook you up... but you've got to forget about it. Forget about it? Yeah. You've got to. He's just one person. He was our friend! It doesn't matter. Peter, you can't save everybody. There are more important things now. Any time, we could be at war! If you side with the Nazis, then we're at war. You and me, Thomas. I'm not going to forget about Arvid. They murdered him! They murdered my father! Wait a second. What are you talking about? Arvid killed himself. Arvid was a cripple. He didn't belong. What's happened to you? He was a cripple? He killed himself because he did not want to become a murderer. Don't you see that's what they're trying to turn us into? Stop, Peter! Stop talking this way! Just stop it! You gotta go along, make the best of things. They want us to spy on our own parents! Don't you understand? God knows what else they'll do! Peter, we're not in charge. We can't know what's really going on. They're evil, Thomas! Shut up! I'm not hearing this! You don't know what you're saying! Do you want me to re... Just go along. Just make the best of things. It is an honor to be chosen for this detail, Herr Muller. You will answer no questions. Just make sure you deliver these packages... to whom they are intended. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Frau Bachman, you are to have this. You are to take it. Hello? Give this to your mother. Is it a present? Bibsi, who are you talking to? What do you want? You are to have this. What is it? Is it something to do with my husband? When is he coming home? What have you done to him? You are to take it. Heil Hitler. Oh, my God! No! No! No! Aah! No! Frau Linge! It's Peter Muller. Frau Linge, please! Peter, I can't see you right now. - Please, I have to talk to you. - What is it? Please. All right, come in. Slowly. Slow. They killed all their fathers. What, Peter? Ashes. I delivered their ashes. My friend k-killed himself. And my mother doesn't... But I was so scared, I didn't know what to do. I... - It's all right, Peter. - It's not all right! It's not all right! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! God, the night they came and took my father away... we were in the middle of dinner. We were in the middle of dinner, and they just came in. And we didn't do anything. He told us not to do anything. He... He was so calm. He... he didn't seem scared at all, and... and... when they brought him back four months later... I wasn't sure it was him. He looked so different. He... he was so weak he couldn't even speak. And he didn't go near his violin. He was so scared... he wouldn't leave the house and pick up the telephone or... And I... I just... I don't... I don't know what they could have done to him. My papa. He... he was so brave. He... he was... wonderful. I found something after you left the last time. It's a letter from your father to my husband. Shall I read it to you? "We must all take responsibility... "for what is happening to our country. "If those of us who have a voice... "do not raise it in outrage... "at the treatment of our fellow human beings... "we will have collaborated in their doom. "It is not good enough to raise these voices in our homes. "Many Germans do this. But outside their doors... "all they hear is Hitler's voice of hate... his promises of glory." He goes on later in the letter to talk about you. "Every day... "I look at my son, my Peter... "and he's grown a little bit bigger. "He's already becoming a man. "And what curiosity. "Always asking questions. Question after question." "Until he fully understands the answer." "The sight of his small face, strong and hopeful... "awakening to the world around him... "is what keeps me going. It is when I think of him..." "that I know what I'm doing must be done." You must go now, Peter. I must go. And you must be strong. We'll meet again. Take me with you. Stay and wait for Mama. I don't want to stay here. I want to go with you. I can't take you with me, Willi. I wish I could. This is a letter from Papa. He did love us. Never think he didn't. Bei mir bist du shon Please let me explain Bei mir bist du shon Means that you're grand I could say, "Bella, bella" Even say, "Wunderbar" Each language only helps me tell you How grand you are I tried to explain Bei mir bist du shon So kiss me and say you understand I could say, "Bella, bella" Even say, "Wunderbar" Each language only helps me tell you How grand you are Ah Everybody out of the truck! Move, move, move, move, move! Everybody out of the truck! Move, move, move! On my signal. Come on, pound him! Uhh! Stop it! You leave him alone! All right, keep moving! Let's go! OK, come on! Let's go! Let go of me! Let him go! Where are you taking him? Thomas. Uhh! Aah! - Uhh! - Aah! Aah! Uhh! Go on. Get out of here. You said they'd never split us apart. Peter... please! You! Stop there! Go! Go on! And then what? H.J. by day, swing kid by night? You don't understand. They'll send you to a work camp! They won't let it go this time! It doesn't matter. I know who my friends are. I'm not alone. You two! That one over there! You're not a murderer, Thomas. You're not like them. Come on, swing kid. They're waiting for you right over here. If he comes over here, tell him where I am. Wait! Bring that one here. Into the truck. Come on. I didn't do anything! Get down there! Get down! On the ground! Such a waste. So much passion, for nothing. It don't mean a thing If it ain't got that swing Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah Peter! Swing heil! Swing heil! All right. Settle down. Get in the truck. Peter! Peter! Peter! Peter! Peter! It's OK, Willi! It's OK! Swing heil! Swing heil! Peter! Swing heil! Swing heil! Peter! Peter! Swing heil! Swing heil!
