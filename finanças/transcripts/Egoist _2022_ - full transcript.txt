Switch up the movement. Very adorable. Swallow. Very good. Tuck up the skirt. Very adorable. Great. That's it. Adorable. Yes. Adorable. Adorable. Very good, very good. Alright, let's check. How is it? I think... it's very adorable. But maybe a little brighter would be better. Sorry to bother you. Then I'll adjust the lighting a bit brighter. Let's adjust the lighting. What do you think? I think... the smile should be a bit more prominent. Sorry to bother you. Navy blue, beige, white, beige. I really don't understand this combination. Oh, meeting your boyfriend's family is a big deal. Then just wear the clothes you like. Egoist. Egoist. Egoist. Egoist. Egoist. Egoist. Egoist. Egoist. Egoist. Egoist. Egoist. Egoist. Anyway, as long as it's not sweet, it's fine, right? Right, exactly. Too sweet doesn't go well with a meal. Haha, but sweet drinks are also delicious. Hey, listen to me. Go ahead. I suddenly remembered something from the other day. I went to get a marriage registration form. That's Amazing. What's going on? You know, same-sex marriage is not recognized in Japan. - But we still wanted to get married. - Sorry, could you pour me a glass of water? So, we took the marriage registration form, filled it out together. Like this. Is it like that? Isn't that Masaki Mizumori's move? After we finished writing, we stuck it on the wall. I really don't know what he was like before. He used to be really muscular. Is that so? Incredibly strong, with abs and all. His abs were really famous. Exactly, and he even does love fortune-telling. Like those Amida's blessings. - So, he used to be a muscular guy. - Impressive. Well, forget it. At our age, we shouldn't think too much about it. - That's true. - No matter how hard we try, it won't work. Nan, are you exercising? Of course. Actually, I haven't put much effort into it. You need someone to push you, right? That's true. So, where's the best place to work out? You're rich, why not hire a personal trainer? I actually thought of someone. Well, how should I put it? He seems like a beginner. Seems like he just started this profession recently. A beginner? Yes. Is he gay? Yes, he's gay. How old is he? Around 24. Young, huh? In this day and age, finding a personal trainer is like hiring an escort. Finding a young boy who's in his prime? I get it. It's like going to a nightclub. Then tell me his contact information. Sure. But even someone like him has needs. That's true. By the way, how did we end up talking about this? We still need to tighten up our bodies. yes their business is expanding. In order to escape the grudges of the past and their rural hometown. I came to Tokyo when I was 18. The clothes I wear are my "armor". This guy is "Number One Pig." By the way, yesterday I was playing a game. I ended up losing in the final stage. It's always easy to mess up in the end. - I'm really frustrated. - Yeah, I know that feeling. Flies so far. Flies really far. That's great. It's better to give snacks than this kind of thing. Who wants the funeral gift from a dead gay bitch? Back then, it was those "pigs" who looked down on me and my mother, but protected me. It's a designer clothing. I'm back. I received another invitation for your middle school reunion. I'm busy and can't go. Just throw it away. Since you're so busy, you don't have to come all the way back every year on the anniversary of their death. It's only once a year, just to greet my mom. Your mom must be happy too, right? Have you found a suitable partner? What? At your age, you should think about settling down. Your mom probably wants to see your child too. Let's talk about it when there's a suitable partner. Is it Mr. Saito? it's me. - Sorry for being late. - No problem I am sorry. I'm the personal trainer you scheduled, Ryuuta Yoshimura. I'm Saito. Pleased to meet you. Last set of ten. Are you okay? I'm fine. Drenched like a wet chicken. this way, please. Thank you for your trouble. Keep going for another three minutes. It feels great, right This... Yeah, it's quite tiring. How often do you work out these days? Before, I used to work out twice a week. Twice a week. And what about recently? Recently, it's been once a month. Once a month, huh... It's such a waste that you have such a strong physique and don't exercise. Right? I think so too. Your body is so flexible. Really? Yes. You look really handsome. Seriously, even better than what they say. Please don't be so polite. But you really are handsome, aren't you? You saying that makes me feel embarrassed. Get up, 4. Great. Get up, 5. Look up at a 45-degree angle to the side. This side? Good, 6. One final push, support yourself. Support myself? Lift it up, lift it up. lift it up. good! You did great. You did great. Upwards, 6, a bit higher. Only two more to go, keep it up. Engage the core. Are you doing planks? That shows how hardworking you are. Okay, extend your right leg. Hold your left foot. Do you have time later? Yes. If it's convenient, I'd like to give you some dietary advice. Sure. If you don't mind, let's go to the nearby cafeteria. Sure, no problem. Really? That's great. Let's go. Next, grab your foot and step... My recommended dish is grilled chicken skewers. If not available, go for sashimi. Can I eat raw sashimi? Yes, you can. And don't forget to drink protein powder today. Got it. During and after the workout, and also at night and the next morning, make sure to drink it. The brand I recommend is... Slow down a bit, let me write it down first. Sorry. it's okay no problem Nakamura, did you learn all this by yourself? Yes, that's right. Actually, I want to go to school and further my education. So, I'm currently doing part-time jobs. What kind of part-time job? Late-night part-time job. Does being an editor pay well? Not really. But well, I can't really consider myself part of the salaried class. Impressive. I dropped out of high school, so I couldn't choose my job. But nowadays, education doesn't have much influence, right? And my family is a single-income household. My mom got sick when I was 14, so I had to work. So now, I'm doing other part-time jobs while working as a personal trainer. But I want to gradually make personal training my main profession. That's amazing. Really? It's amazing. Let me pay. I'll take care of it. Or let me pay, I'm a salaried worker. Just for today, okay? Let me pay. Well, thank you then. Please split the bill. The total is 1,250 yen. Okay. Oops, sorry. It's okay, no problem. Sorry. Are you okay? Are you really okay? ..I'm fine. Let me pay, alright? Please, can we not talk for a moment? What's wrong? Did I scratch it here? Should I take a look? Yes. Then let me see. It's just swollen, should be fine. It's swollen... it hurts! It really hurts! It should be okay. Can you wait for a moment? Okay. Sorry. What's wrong? I want to buy a gift to take home for my mom. But everything is so expensive. Really? Very expensive? Extremely expensive. How are you doing? I'm fine. It's really swollen. I think "Tragedy of WwW" is truly a landmark film in Japanese cinema history. You see, Mita Yoshiko won many awards through this film. Hiroko Yokoshimaru also transitioned into an actress because of it. Every time I watch it, I remember Bourbonne's performance. Indeed. Hey, are you listening? Hmm, hold on a moment. We're talking about your favorite "Tragedy of WwW." I know, the "Ordinary Woman," right? Yes. What are you doing? What are you doing Talking to a personal trainer. Ah, the one from last time? right. What happened after that? So, how is he? Is the kid handsome? Well, he's quite handsome. Here it comes. But I think he's very innocent. Incredibly pure, a really good little boy. What do you know about innocence? I mean, I don't really know. What are you doing? I have to send him everything I eat. For example, "fried chicken combo, less rice." What did you report today? Just say I had this, this, and this? Actually, it's better to eat something salty, but grilled chicken skewers are passable too. If I send him all of this, he'll be sad. Why sad? Isn't your task to send him everything you eat? He's a good kid. That doesn't have anything to do with being a good kid... You're lying. There are two types of lies, you know. One is a "malicious lie," and the other is a "kind lie." Mine is the latter. Don't try to fool people with seemingly reasonable words. Just don't eat so much. Oh well, I couldn't help it. But in the end, do you have any intention of restraining yourself or... I am restraining myself, but I can't resist eating. You're not restraining yourself at all! That wolfish way of eating shows no restraint. It disappears with a "gulp" into your mouth. - gone in a second - It was just right here. Can't help it, the pizza in front of me disappears in the blink of an eye. I even saw the trajectory. There's no trajectory. It all ends up in your big mouth. So, I'm the victim here. What's that? Pretending to be a victim now? I am the victim. Here he goes again. he started again Little Wu's specialty. Hey, why don't you join in, Hao Fu? No way, I absolutely won't.

It's really hot. Really? Wait a moment. Oh no, not good. Is everything okay? Wait a moment. Feels so comfortable. Alright, it's done. Thank you. Shall I make tea for you? No, I'll do it myself.

Enjoy your meal. Thank you. Now, I'll pour the milk. Are you conducting a science experiment? - cheers. - cheers. It's delicious. Indeed, it's really tasty. Nakamura, you forgot something important. Ah, I forgot. Thank you. It's no problem. Just call me Ryota. Don't call me Yukimura, call me Ryota. Ah, then you can call me Kosuke. Hao-fu... No, I'll still call you Mr. Hao-fu. That's fine too.

When I was a kid... Since my mom got sick, our family had our only trip together. We went to the seaside. Looking back now, that hotel was really run-down... But as a child, I was really happy. I was so excited that I kept talking to Mom the whole time we were in bed. The next day, probably in the morning, we went to a beautiful cape. I don't know why, but I just kept staring at the sea. The sea breeze was really strong. I was thinking, can this wind blow away Mom's illness? Hey, what's the matter? Stop it. Why are you hitting me? Mr Kosuke "Membership Card I" At 10 o'clock. Do you believe in heaven? Why are you suddenly asking about that? Heaven? Heaven? I don't believe in that kind of thing at all. Is that so? I only believe in things I can see. But if there is a heaven, maybe one day we'll be able to see your mom again, right? Well, thinking about it won't give us an answer to this kind of thing. Kosuke-san, you're really a super realist.

I asked him, "Is he the 'important person' to you?" Ryota couldn't answer. so i told him It doesn't matter whether you like men or women. As long as you can find the person you truly love, isn't that the best thing? Ryota was just like you back then. He said countless times, "I'm sorry." But Ryota also said, "I was saved by Mr. Kosuke "So, this world is not just hell..." I'm really thankful to you. Why did you suddenly come back? Did something happen? sorry, i came back to find something. You could have told me, and I would have helped you find it. But that thing is something only I know where it is Is that so? Have you found it? No, I'll go back to my house in Tokyo and look for it again. I see. So, are you staying overnight tonight? Yeah, I'll stay for the night. Then I'll go cook dinner. Really? Thank you. Yeah, fish is delicious - I was going to say.. - Yeah? During the time when Mom was sick, was it difficult for you? It wasn't that difficult, really. There was just one time when your mom shouted at me, telling me to leave her. She said, 'I don't want to trouble you anymore. And then? And then I said, 'If you hate me, let's get a divorce...' But if it's not like that, then don't say those things anymore. Since we know each other, this is our fate. If it's fate, then let's continue on together. I'm not good at expressing myself, I didn't know what to say to her. But at that time, both your mom and I cried like babies. This is the first time I've heard about this. I'm here. Sorry for the sudden visit." Sorry for the sudden visit. Come in, come in, it's raining outside. I happened to be nearby and wanted to pay my respects. Thank you for going out of your way. Excuse Me. Thank you. really trouble you It's a bit dark, isn't it? I turned off the lights, sorry about that. Turn on the lights over here. It's a bit brighter now, right? thank you for your hospitality. It's really gloomy in here. Are you doing well lately? thanks to you, I'm doing fine. Are you busy with work? Yeah, it's been busy recently. - Oh, I see - How about you, Auntie Just getting by, making do. Like that.. Yeah, exactly. Oh, Auntie, please accept this little token of appreciation. Huh? What is this? What's this money for? Consider it as a part of your living expenses. I can't accept this. It's too much money... Well.. Well... actually.. I've been supporting Ryota every month. He has been working hard for you. Did Ryota suggest this? Oh no, it's not like that. It was my decision to support him. It's more like a form of sponsorship. Every month?" Yes, Ryota has been working really hard for you. "I also wanted to do something for both of you. So, I provided him with support. There's really no other meaning to it. I just wanted to work hard together with him. Oh. F and people. How should I put it? Ryota has passed away now. I want to do something for you on his behalf. But... even if you say so... I appreciate your kindness, but I can't accept this money. But I want to... I hope your future life can be a bit more stable. so...... Even though I can't fully replace Ryota... but seriously, even if I can show filial piety in this way... I hope you can accept my impolite request. Thank you so much. Thank you. I've really been selfish. I'm sorry... But I really can't forget everything. Ryota used to work so hard. And I sponsored Ryota every month. What can I do for you? I really can't accept that everything has turned into nothingness Please... I'm sorry... Please, I beg you. I'm sorry. I don't feel good hearing your apologies either. All right. Then let's stop apologizing to each other. That's true. Well, thank you. I also want to thank you. Okay, we're done. Okay, we're done. Another drink. Another drink... That's enough, Xiaowu. Why not dilute all your troubles with alcohol? Is it not good this way? Keep working, hurry up. But you seem to be in good spirits, right? Isn't that so? Let me tell you, I helped his mother with a small favor. What kind of favor? It's about the money.... You gave her money? Also bought some things... Are you offering sacrifices or something? But I didn't give much. How much did you give? I give as much as I love... just enough for living expenses. But you're not that well-off either... How about yourself? It's okay. It's not what you think at all. What do you mean? Lao An, what do you think? Let Xiaoxiao handle it... It's complicated if we involve Lao An. Don't worry about it. By the way, Kota, how are you? What about the marriage application form? Don't ask about that. Don't ask. Bringing that up just hurts. Really? So soon? Forget it. Let's have a drink. Although it was just for fun, it still hurts. What? Weren't things going well between you before? We got divorced... Isn't that better? Is it? It withered like this. Where should I put this? I'll put it on the balcony for now? Okay. put it here. What about this side? Should I clean it up a bit? Okay, sure. Thank you for your trouble. It's rare to have such good weather today. Is that so? I have to clean up near my house too... Yeah, after all, you lost your mother early. Yes, but my father is quite diligent. Can he cook? Yes. Does he also do house cleaning? Yes, we take turns doing household chores. I really married the wrong person. Ryota's dad doesn't care about anything at home. When Ryota was still in elementary school, he started bringing women home. That's really outrageous. How can there be such a person? Unbelievable, right? I was the one who discovered it. But I really felt that I couldn't go on anymore because of that incident. I asked him, "What if Ryota sees it?" And he said, "Maybe their school is organizing a summer camp?" "I know about it." "I know about it"... What's that attitude? Yes, he had no fear at all. Later, he eloped with that woman. But he called my house later. What did he say to you? Actually, I don't even want to hear his voice. But he still had that arrogant tone. Wait, can I guess? Go ahead, guess. Was he asking for money? You got it. That's exactly it. But at that time, I had some health problems. Longtai was worried about me, so he dropped out of high school to work and support the family. I can't do something that betrays Ryota. So I told him that no matter what he said, he wouldn't work. That's really how it should be. He confidently said, "Ryuta is making money, right? "So, you must have money at home, right?" I've never been so angry before." hangs up the phone After that, he never called again. Thank you so much for helping me through all of this. No trouble at all. Thank you very much. You're welcome. This should be about it then. Yes. It's already late. Well, I should probably leave soon. Would you... like to stay overnight? How can I impose like that? Tomorrow, you have a day off, right? Yes, I don't have work tomorrow. Then, sleep in Ryu's room. Oh, I'll prepare hot water for you to take a bath. Can I really? I'll prepare it for you right away. Wait a moment. I'm sorry for the trouble. I left pajamas and towels outside. Ah, thank you for the hall. Thank you, Auntie. Oh dear, Ryu's clothes are a bit small. It's alright. No, really. Where? It's because I'm too strong. But you should be grateful to your parents for having such a strong body. Thanks to your parents. Actually, it's a bit too strong. didn't intend for Ryu to have such a strong physique. He was weak when he was young, but he worked really hard, grew up to be so tall. I guess that's why he wanted to do that.. What's it called? Training? It's the kind of job that helps people who work hard. I think that's how he sees it.. Yes. Stand up. Feels so comfortable. Hey, my body can't take it anymore. Nonsense, you're getting older. no no no I think it's time to sort things out in Ryu's room. Take whatever you want. Then I'll go take a look later. Yes, over there. Feels so comfortable. You're feeling much better now. Is it ok? Yes, thank you. Would you like something to drink? Thank you. Can you help me dye my hair? sure. Like this? Yeah. That's great. I'm good at this kind of thing.. because I also have a lot of white hair. You're still young... No, no, when you look over here. Ah, really, there are some. Right, oh. Sorry for bothering you, thank you for your hospitality. Thank you too. Then I'll leave. Alright. Here, for this month. Thank you so much. If you don't mind, how about living together? Living in my house, just the two of us. Isn't that... too much? No, no, it's completely fine. There's no problem at all. No, it's really too much. Why would you say that? Isn't it better to live together? In case something happens, it's good to have someone living together for support. I'm sorry. Thank you for your kindness, but this time, please listen to me. Please. That is... It's completely fine. If you don't want to, Please have a friend's heart. From Daikura Kyufu. Welcome. Hello, please wait a moment. Hello, I'm Saito. May I ask... Hello.

No, I'm not. is it your son no I-I'm the person who has been taking care of her son. How did you know I was here? your neighbor told me. I'm sorry for not telling you. I felt that if I told you, you would worry. I worried even more because you didn't tell me. I'm sorry. Why are you in the hospital? Let's go downstairs for a walk. Today, I really ran around to many places. Is that so... And you're carrying such heavy things. I'm sorry. How about resting here for a while? Do you want to sit here? Then let me help you get out.

The doctor said it's already stage four. pancreatic cancer. I really don't want to have cancer. The doctor said the back pain is also because of it. I probably don't have much time left. I'm sorry. What? It's my fault. No, it's not. I'm sorry. No, it's not. It's me... I pushed Ryota too hard. it's not your fault. It's all my fault for making Ryota do so much work and leaving you alone. Turns out no one noticed your condition what are you talking about No, it's not like that. Stop apologizing. No, it's not like that. Stop apologizing. You didn't do anything wrong. You don't need to apologize. I really appreciate you. If I'm not mistaken, You should... Love Ryuta And love me too, right? I think that's how it is. I...... I really don't understand what love is. It's okay if you don't understand. As long as we feel that you love us, isn't that enough? It's alright, it's alright. Hello. You came How was your day today? This one is so beautiful. Is it? Then I'll put it in a vase. Is he your son? No, he's not. Yeah. He's my son whom I'm proud of. So beautiful.
