- Anybody betting against my dog, be prepared to go home a loser! Hey, Mercer! You know all about being a loser! We'll see about that. - He's going in? - Scabbed over and ready to fight. - Come on, let's go! Go get him! Go! Go! Go! Go! Inside! - Nanna, stop! - For your tube thingy. Give you something to twitter about. - Tweet. Hey! What're you thinking? You're blocking the way out, grandma! You're a nutcase. - What'd that guy say? - He was just admiring my birds. - Birds? You don't have any birds. - Why don't you go on to the game? I'll park the car. Isn't he just one batter away from-- - Mom, don't say it out loud, you'll jinx him. - Travis, buddy, he's a chip off the old woodshed. One more throw for his-- - Come on, Peety, you know better. Strike two! - Dad, that guy over there is talking about Decklin. What's a no-hitter? - Woo. One more game till state. What'd I miss? - I missed the pitch. The one that kept you from a perfect game. Why? Because Paige decided she had to tell me a scout was there. - It's just one pitch, dad. - I can't help you if I can't see what's wrong. I mean, scouts don't just... If you're gonna make it, you have to be at the top of your game, every single game. - Hey. - Remember, Paige's daddy-daughter dance is coming up. No excuses. You just make sure your work schedule's clear that night and she still needs a dress. It's traditional, Travis, daddy's buy the dress. Oh, shit! I mean, rats, I gotta go. Talk to you at home. - Here, let me help you. - Thanks, Robin, you're a dear. - Oh, no problem. Hey, Paige. - Hey, Robin. - How're you settling in? - You know, a little bit of a learning curve but I think I'm getting the hang of it. - Nanna, Decklin's gonna be home any second. - Hold your horses, squirt. - You guys have a good one. - You too. Nice girl. - Hey, Deck, wanna toss the ball around? - Hey, kiddo. No way. Just had a two-a-day. I'm all tuckered out after practice. - But I've been working on my throws. I think the game ball could be my secret weapon. - Well maybe later? I'll see you inside, little dipper. - I'm starving. That smells good. What is it? - One pot wonder. - Let's keep the mystery inside your novels. Come on, give me a clue. - You throw things in a pot and wonder how it'll turn out. - Why am I paying for the Food Network? Ugh. Oh, getting old, ma. You're losing your edge. - Watch out. I might just quit this thankless job I don't get paid for. - What's wrong? - Paige wants to join the Everyday Girl's Club. They teach outdoor skills and-- - No. - But. - Last time was martial arts, 300 bucks, then she wanted to do gymnastics. We don't have an endless disposable income, mom. - She can do baseball. No! - Fine, no baseball. - I just think you should spend more time with her. - Me? What would I do with her? - Decky? - Hmm? What? - There you are. You're dad's at his fantasy baseball and I have my scrapbook party, which means you are on Paige duty. - Okay. - Don't let her watch anything scary. - Okay. Wait, why? - Last time she jumped in bed with me. Happens again, she sleeps with you. - Win big, Nanna! I don't know what you're talking about. - Hey, Paige! Yeah? - That show you're not allowed to watch. It's running a marathon. Yes! - You think this is scary? - I'm nine. I still think storms are scary. - All right, just don't go into Nanna's room when you get scared. I was warned. - I wouldn't-- - It's time to pay up, Little Dipper. - Come on, Decklin. - No, that was the deal. Your show for my chores. Have fun. - It's just a frog. Or it could be a frog sent by aliens. Hey there. Where'd you come from? You like pizza? Come with me. - Yeah. Yeah, I'm watching Paige, she's fine. Yeah. Don't lose the grocery money. Miss Langady's eyes twitch when she's bluffing. All right, love you too, bye. - Come on, girl, follow me. Okay, listen, you've gotta be a secret for awhile but I have a plan. - What you reading? - Chapter books. - Uh oh. Clear. You wanna hang out this weekend together? - Um, sure, that sounds cool. Dad? - Yeah? - Nevermind. Night. - Good talk. I love you. - I love you too, Paige. - You don't see it, do you? - See what? Mom, I know you hate it when you talk without saying anything. - It's not Paige's fault. You are struggling with double-A ball. Do you really think you'd have made the majors if we hadn't lost Hollie? - Do you have any idea what it's like to have your dream just stolen out from underneath you? - No. But you have to stop acting like your life is the only one that made a turn. I thought I was going to retire on a beach. This isn't even close. But I wouldn't change it for a second. Can you say the same? - "Go mow the lawn. "Go take care of Paige." Don't you see me going? - It's okay. That's Decklin. - Oh, you are in so much trouble. - It's not my fault, I found her. She's hurt. We gotta help her. - Okay, well first of all, she is a he. - How do you know? You're not a dog expert. - No but I know. - How? - Parts. She's got boy parts. - Oh. Her name was Duchess. I guess now it's Duke. - Great, now we have to get rid of him. We're gonna take him to a shelter, okay? Don't look at me with those eyes. - But this could be our dog. Yours and mine. I can share. - Now you wanna hide a dog together? Not to mention, Duke needs a vet. He's probably in a lot of pain. What am I even talking about? I have to mow. - I know what's best for you, Duke, that's me. - Travis, did you take my big ceramic bowl? - Mom, why would I take your bowl? It's probably one of the kids. - Nanna, she needs this. - You'd think I don't wanna give her something special. How about a fish? Fish are nice. - Fish are cold. I just want you to consider this. Take Duke to the vet today for Paige, for me, please. - She named it? Mom? Everything okay? - Yeah, just watch your game. Everything is not okay. Did you take my ceramic bowl? - Wha? - Nah. - Come on. Who are you rooting for? - I need a team of Rays on my team. - Ray? Oh, Mr. Sadecki. - Only my mentor and the best left-handed pitcher in baseball. You know the first time I met Ray? When I was just a punk kid playing street ball. Guy like that takes time to work with a kid like me. Where's Nanna going? - Oh, she said something about her bunions. And... And... - Bunions? - Hey, yeah it's me. I don't... I know what I said. My best dog's gone missing. Yeah. By Friday. Dog couldn't gotten that far. - He's been through a lot. - What does that mean? - Well, the infection on his leg's pretty bad. He's gonna have to stay here and have some fluids and antibiotics. - He's gonna be okay, right? - He'll recover. Hazel, can I see you for a minute? I'll be honest, this is what we would call a rescue situation. Based on my examination, it's pretty clear Duke was used in illegal dog fighting. - Dog fighting? - I wasn't aware that there was any in our area but dog fighting happens everywhere. So what are you saying? - These animals usually need rehabilitation. We're never gonna know the things he endured and often they become aggressive. - He seems good with Paige. I just need to make sure that you understand the risks. - Thanks for seeing us after hours. - I assume you'll cover the medical costs? - Yeah. - Nanna? I'm sorry. Please don't give up. I'll find a way to help pay the bills. - Duke came to use. We'll take care of him, I promise. - You're gonna get me into trouble, little girl. - Hey, buddy. I couldn't wait to get out of school today. The end of the year is so boring. I brought you a snack. I know it's your favorite. - Paige, those kennels weren't really made for kids. - That's okay, Dr. Foster, I don't mind. - That wasn't exactly what I meant. - I think the blue brings out your eyes. - I wish it were that simple. - I'm shopping for my niece. And you? - Daughter. It's the annual father-daughter dance and I was just-- - And your wife? I can't believe I asked that. That's rude, I'm so sorry. - No, wait, I could actually really use your help. My wife is gone. - You're a little lost. - You noticed? - Yeah. - Nanna, this isn't good. Duke is home and you still haven't talked to dad. - Yeah, you're so busted. - I'm your dad's mom, I'll never be busted. - Not how I hear it. - Anyway, he's going on that business trip. Why do today what I can put off until Thursday? Your dad doesn't even know about Duke yet and just in case he has accident, I think this is the best for him. I think it's cozy. - It looks like a big old dog kennel to me. I thought Duke was gonna be part of our family. - He is. Well, he will. I promise. - I'm sorry, boy. I can't believe anyone would ever hurt you. Goodnight. - What did Doc Foster say happened to Duke's leg? You can tell me. I'm almost 10. When Doc cleaned the cut, it looked... It looked sort of like a bite mark. - It was. Doc said Duke came from a dog fighting club. I don't even know what it's called. - Dogs fight? Like grownups boxing? - Sweetie, people put two dogs together and they pick one to bet on. Sort of like boxing. - How do they know who wins? - Whichever dog is left. - Does one of the dogs have to die? - Or be very hurt. Hurt enough to stop fighting. - Who would ever wanna watch that? - Sweetheart. I love you, handsome. - Aw. What're you gonna tell dad? - I have no idea. This means so much to Paige. - I'm on your side, Nanna. - What am I going to do when you leave me? - Two is pushing it. - I blinked and you grew up. - I tried to hold it off for as long as I could. But nature had its way. - And clean your room. Mister. Paige? You're a very pain in the. Goodnight. Next time, I wouldn't try to pass off a dog that not yours. Idiot took the farm supply dog. - Not that I knew the owner was staked. You lying! - I'm sorry! If I'm dead, I can't stay in the game. - Ah. That's a world class beat down. - Bouncers. I owe a guard dog for the farm supply. - Oh. Dude, that's Dave's favorite dog. You're lucky they let you live. - Who's Dave? - Only the guy that sets up the stockyard fights. - Oh God. Get me out. - I need to go find my dog. And there's something in it for you. - Better be. - Guess what, Paige got a new dog. All right, this is where I put my foot down. The dog stays or I'm gone. - Thanks for picking me up. - Did you buy something? New microwave? I told you we don't need a new microwave. - No, I didn't buy anything, I promise. I did fill up at the airport. - You know you spent 10 cents more a gallon. - Wha? I'm guessing you didn't tell dad. - Tell dad what? - Why don't you go downstairs and kick your feet up? Dinner will be ready in a minute. - Sounds good. Did you DVR the game? - Of course. - Nanna? - Smells like dinner's burning. - No, everything's fine. - Nanna, tell him before you put paint thinner in the gravy or something equally as horrible. - Yeah, what Decklin said. - I'll tell him at dinner. - Nanna! You're enabling her. - I don't even know what that means. How was your trip? - It was good, it was long. It's good to be home. Hey, will you get me an ice tea, sweetie? - Mhmm. - Wait a minute. You smell funny. - I think it's puberty. - You all look like you're in a toothpaste commercial. What's up? - I have something to tell you. - Finally. - I made your favorite dessert. - Decklin, could you help me? - You need help carrying dessert? - Help your grandma. You're awfully chipper tonight. There we go, that's more like it. Where's my pie? - I ate it. - You ate my favorite dessert? - I've been really hungry after these extra practices. Hope you don't mind. - No, not at all but we should probably rush you to the hospital though, huh? - Why would we need to go to the hospital? - See, your brother is allergic to strawberries, so if he ate a pie, a strawberry pie, he'd be going into anaphylactic shock right now. - Oh yeah, you'd be dying, Decklin. - Dying, Decklin. - Nanna, you're gonna have to tell dad. I know he doesn't do laundry but he's gonna figure this out. - I hope you're enjoying that. You're eating the bribery pie. I'm not gonna discuss this anymore, mom! No dog! Absolutely not! - You didn't see her. - I don't care! She loves that dog! It's not about want. She needs this! Listen to me, she needs to focus on school and making some friends! - Nanna's gonna win. It's her turn. This is going to happen! I'm not-- This is a trial. A trial, meaning at any time for any reason, I decide the dog is gone. - Duke. - The vet said that it could get aggressive given its history. Also, you're gonna feed it, you're gonna walk it and you're gonna clean up after it. - Duke. - Are we good? - Thank you, daddy! Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You really got a dog? - Yep. A big one. He just wondered into my yard. Like magic. - That's so cool. I've always wanted a dog but my dad-- Crowley, your up, let's go! - I'll have to basically humiliate myself. - Come on, Paige, you got this. Move it! - Come on, Paige. - She didn't have it. - Maybe we should just move your bed in here. - You think it would fit? We have Decklin's game. - You know I hate baseball. Don't we all. - Hey, dad. - Hey. - I'm proud of you for being cool about the whole dog thing. MVP of the game. I see royal blue in your future. - Don't get carried away, dad. Next week we go against the guys from Blue Springs. - No negative thinking. Your team's got a real shot. - I swear those kids started steroids when they were in grade school. Hey, you remember that dance is on Friday, right? - Yeah, I got the dress. - Dad, it's father-daughter dance. The dress doesn't matter if you're not with me while I'm wearing it. - Well, I had to juggle a few things around to make the tournament, which is kinda my championship. Look, I'm gonna take you out. You can wear the dress, I'll wear a tie. - All the girls in my class are going. You never miss anything for Decklin. - Paige, that's not fair. - First dance only happens once. - Do you think I treat the kids differently? - Not intentionally. I hope not intentionally. You love baseball. Decklin plays baseball. Paige-- - Don't love baseball. - It's complicated. - I think I got it. - I'm gonna take Duke for a walk. - Hey, hey. Don't be rude now. I swear I've seen that dog somewhere before. Now that dog don't belong to you. - Hey, are you okay? - I'm going to go check on Paige. Robin, thanks for bringing them home. - Not a problem. They're quite a package. - Tell me about it. - I think you misunderstood. They're adorable. She's gonna look great in her new dress. For the dance. - Oh. So what do you do when you're not rescuing little girls and dogs? - I'm in hospitality. What about you? - I.T. sales. I'm a closer for the challenging clients that are trying to stretch it out for the free dinners. You know. - Yeah, we pretty much have the same job. - You think? - Do you realize everything you say is phrased as a question? - Really? - Still a question. - How am I supposed to get to know you better if I don't ask questions? Still a question. - Yeah. I better head out. Hospitality doesn't serve itself. Are you gonna answer that. - You think I should? - It could be one of those big deals that needs closing. It's me calling. Paige gave me your number. Now you got mine. - Thanks. I mean, thanks. Have a good evening. - Bye. - I oughta put you out of your misery. I got more game than you. - Thanks, mom. You really lift me up where I belong. - If you ever need advice on how to make a move, you can always talk to me. - I think I just threw up in my mouth. Thank you. - I'll stop. The detective's on his way over. - So he told you the dog wasn't yours but he didn't claim that it was his dog? - It doesn't matter. Duke's my dog. - Honey, it's okay. The detective is here to sort things out. - If you need to take the dog into custody, that's fine. - No! - Guess your dad doesn't want a dog. Anyway, do you remember anything else about him? I've got that he was a black male, younger than a dad but older than Decklin. He had a funny tattoo on his arm. It looked kinda like an empty paper towel tube. That's it. - Did he look anything like this guy? - Yep, that's him. You're a really good detective. - And you're a doll. Look, I need to talk to the adults for a minute, okay? - This guy's name is Lyle Barrett. He's into guns, drugs and other nasty pastimes, including dog fighting. - Leave it to Paige to pick a dog with criminal affiliations. She couldn't find some nice abandoned chihuahua? - It isn't Duke's fault. - Sir, your family's probably the best thing that ever happened to that animal. Look, I've been on busts at places like this and it's brutal. - What should we do? - I'd be hypervigilant. These people are crazy about their dogs and if Lyle knows the previous owner, they might come looking. - Then we get rid of it, period. - Well, I don't think you should overreact. In fact, this gives us a great lead on tracking down a ring we've been looking for for some time. - Thank you. - This is for you. Cause you'll be able to find the bad guy now, right? - Well, it's a start and I'll be looking. Here, take this. I gave one to your dad too but if you see anything or anyone makes you feel uncomfortable, you call me. - Thanks Mr. Brady. No one's ever given me a business card before. Mercer! Dude. - Get out of my face. - Fine. Guess you don't care I saw your dog today. - You saw my dog? Where? - I don't know. Maybe you oughta give me a little something. - This better be worth it, Lyle. You ain't the reliable kind. - I swear on my sweet ride, I saw him. - Where? - Walking path. A little water tower, he was on a leash with some little kid. - Some what, what'd he look like? - It was a girl. Brown hair. Mosey looking, that's all I know. - That does nothing for me. - Calm down. Look, there's only one elementary school in town. How hard can it be to find a girl that got a new dog that looks like a walking shag rug? Right? - Hey, Mitch. - Yeah. - You got a kid in school? - Yep. Deuce, sixth grade. Why? - Can I buy you a beer? - Yeah. - Two beers. - This is totally not cool. - It's just for awhile. Most kids would love not having to ride a smelly old bus. - No, Nanna, believe me. Being driven to school is like the popularity kiss of death. - Nanna and I talked about it. It's just the way it's gonna be. You are just gonna have to rise above the kiss of death. Okay? - Easy for you to say. - Hey, no kiss? - Kiss Nanna or Decklin. I already got your kiss of death. - I'm worried about leaving but I can't cancel. - As long as you make it back for the dance Friday. - Mhmm. Why aren't we talking to your kid? - Forget it, my kid's useless. What I wouldn't give to throw one of them in the ring. - I don't think you're allowed to do that. Deuce! What'd you find out about the girl with the dog? - What do I get if I tell you? - My gratitude. Hey, where you going? - I gotta get an education. Gratitude doesn't pay for my new Xbox. - I'll give you 10 bucks. - Come back when you got 50. - Oh, he takes after his mother. She cleaned me dry. I live in a trailer, I'm lucky to have a toilet. - Hey, come back here. Deuce. Make it quick, Suzie Schoolmarm is on her way over here. - Fourth grader, name is Paige. Lives out past the water tower. Last name? Excuse me? You can't be here. - Your kid is a shifty little hustler. - Yeah, I'm a proud dad. - Do you know these guys? - Nope. - You little-- - I just called the front desk. The authorities are on their way. We take "stranger danger" very seriously around here. - Play where I can see both of you. - I've got an idea. - Jake, your ideas usually end with me grounded. Let's just study. - Stop peeing your pants. Nothing we do now is gonna affect whether or not we graduate. He's got a point. Seriously? - Yeah. It'd be our very own fight club. - What's fight club? - You need an education in some film awesomeness. Brought an air horn just in case. Paige. - You guys are gonna let me play? Yeah, kid, you get to run the show. - Hey. - Gotta be ready. What? - Okay, okay, okay, stop. Stop, stop, stop! Stop, stop! I'm blowing the horn! - I am a human banana, you will respect me. Guys, stop. I have a weak esophagus, you can't do that. Stop. - You let Jake pound on me. Now it's only fair if I get to pound on you! - You two were having what Nanna calls "Alpha Man Disease" and there isn't a cure. Not my fault. - Now it's on. - Can I ask you a question? - It's not gonna stop what's coming. I'm bringing the pain. - No, really. - Fine but I'm coming after you. - Why are all your friends nerds? - You know I don't care about stuff like that. You're the star pitcher on the high school baseball team but you hang out with Corey. - You know, you're a little bit of a stalker. It's gonna get you in trouble. Jail time, even. - I like to think of observation as my super power. - Okay, so why don't you tell me why. - I think you're secretly a nerd and you don't want dad to find out. - Oh! That's cold. - Oops, better wash that. I learned in science class that soda's corrodible or something. - It's corrosive. - That's it. Will you feed Duke too? Can I get you anything else, your highness? - It'd like an ice tea with lemon. Three cubes, not four. - Hey pup. Hey. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - You want some? - Hey, I'm gonna turn in, Little Dipper, I'm beat. - Okay, love you. Love you too. - Boo! - You shouldn't scare your poor old grandma like that. Come outside with me for a second. You know, Decklin was only a year younger than you are now when you were born. I don't think he wanted to share the spotlight with a new baby. - Well, I guess he didn't need to worry about that. - I told him we were all connected like the stars. He was like the Big Dipper and the Big Dipper hangs over the little one. - That's why he calls me Little Dipper? - Yep. He still remembers that story. All right. That's enough sappiness for one night. Don't tell anyone. - Don't worry, Nanna, I won't tell anyone you got sappy. Dad's not gonna make it back in time for the dance, is he? - You've got to be kidding me, Travis. Why did you wait until now to call? She's waiting for you. Waiting for her dad to walk through the door. You really did. - He's not gonna make it, is he? It'll be all right. - Come on, boy, dinner time for you. - We better get going, Little Dipper. Get over here. ¶ The only thing I need to know right now ¶ ¶ Is you, is your and I ¶ - You sure we're gonna find the girl? - Every girl in town will be here tonight. They all got dreams of wearing glass slippers. - You haven't spotted her yet? - You want your dog back or what? I'm getting two shades darker out here. She give it another. Wait. - Is that her? Is that the girl? She wasn't all shinny and sparkly but yeah. That's her. What now? - License plate. There's an app for that. - What, like Angry Birds? - I should be mad. I am but I kinda expect it. I'm sorry dad didn't make it home but I'm glad you're my big brother. - Paige, you can always count on me. Got it? - Got it. - Now what? - I was just thinking how the girls in my class will be so jealous. They're there with their bald dads and you do have great hair. - I do, don't I? Not to mention, not one wrinkle and a killer tan. - You ready? - Are you ready? ¶ On easy street ¶ ¶ Now I'm okay with that ¶ ¶ The only thing I need to know right now ¶ - Yes. ¶ Oh, the places we will go ¶ ¶ Passed the will unknown ¶ ¶ As long as you're with me ¶ ¶ We can cross the world ¶ ¶ And I will be your girl ¶ - Do me a favor? - Anything for the prettiest girl in the dance hall. - Ick with the gushy compliments. Will you go ask the girl over there to dance? Her name is Laura. - That's the girl that gives you a hard time. - Yeah but in terms of what we want in common. Please? - Fine. But I know what this. You can't keep up with my dance moves. Hey. - Hi. - May I have this dance? - Sure. - I'm Decklin. ¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶ ¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶ ¶ Anyway you go ¶ ¶ Oh ¶ Wanna try to spin? That's good. ¶ I'll go anywhere you go ¶ ¶ Oh ¶ ¶ I love you so ¶ ¶ I'll go anywhere you go ¶ Good. - I got this, thank you. ¶ Oh ¶ ¶ I love you so ¶ ¶ I'll go anywhere you go ¶ - You're Decklin Crowley, right? - Yeah, that's me. - You've got a mean curve ball. I imagine the offers are just rolling in. So you guys also looking at any type of endorsement deals or what are you guys looking at right now or are you just totally focused on the draft? - I told you what keeping that dog could lead to. Now look. He guilted me into a decision that may have cost him his future. - Don't blame Nanna. Decklin knew how much I loved Duke. This is all my fault. - Maybe if you'd have been here, really here, Decklin wouldn't have been forced to make up the difference. You wanna point the finger? Look in the mirror. - This is about a dog. Do you realize that? This dog! It's ridiculous. - That's not what it's about. Maybe you should wait in the visitor's lounge. There's wifi. You could keep working. - May I speak with the two of you? - Of course. - I'm sorry to inform you that Decklin appears to have serious nerve damage. - But he's a baseball pitcher. He has a real future, more than I ever had. - The dog also needs to go into quarantine with animal control. It's protocol. I've already contacted Cass County animal services. They'll meet you at your home. Mr. Crowley? - Thank you, Dr. Alan. - Mr. Crowley, do you have any questions? - Yeah, we don't get enough. - Enough? - Second chances. - I can't believe you ditched me at the dance. What'd the doctor say? - Duke might have to go away for awhile. There are certain things that have to happen. - Duke didn't mean to hurt Decklin. Please. - It's out of our hands. - I have to see him. He's gonna be scared. - Might be too late. - What happened? Did somebody spike the punch? - You had me a little worried. You had us all worried. - Are you mad at me? - Not for a second. Come here. I made a mistake. I should've said something. It was an accident. - It doesn't matter. - Why? - They have to take him away even though he had his shots still. - No. Duke did nothing wrong, I'm fine. I'm gonna be. Whoa. Am I okay? - Let's wait for the doctor to-- No, just tell me, am I okay? - You might not be able to pitch. Not like before. - We made that one heck of a dancing night. - Thank you. God. - So what happened? - I was distracted. All I could think about was Decklin in that hospital bed and Paige. It's my fault. I don't even know why I called you. I just saw your number and-- - Wow, thanks. - I would've called you. I'm just... I don't know, I guess I don't really have anyone right now. - Anytime. - You're a lucky man, Mr. Crowley. Yeah? You sustained a mile concussion. You'll need to rest an hydrate. - Thank you. - Mr. Crowley, I'm not sure what I can do. - I don't care, I have to do something. That guy that approached my daughter, Lyle, where does he hang out? I know that you can help me. The guy that hit me, I got a look at him. If I saw him again, maybe-- - Look, I'd like nothing more than to help you bring this guy down but I'm limited by what I'm allowed to do. - I have to find him. I need to get my dog back. - So he's your dog? - Just tell me where he hangs out. So I'm gonna go find our dog. Anybody wanna help? - You totally got this, dad. - Yeah. My head hurts. Hey. - What, a surprise? - Hospitality, huh? - I make a mean gin and tonic. I'm so sorry about Duke. Do you know a guy, medium build, short brown hair, stubble? He hangs out with a guy named Lyle. - The guy she's talking about has to be Mercer. - Mercer? Even the name sounds bad. - This is my baby. This is Scout. - Aw, she's so cute. - I think I can help you out. I'll ask around okay? You guys head home and if I hear anything, I'll give you a call. - Okay. Thank you. - All right, hold on a second. I just didn't want her to out-kiss me. I'm the closer. - Dad? Dad? - What're you wearing? - Stealthy clothes. - I like your style. - Hello. Paige, is that you? - Yeah? Brandon? What's wrong? - Who's Brandon? - It's about Duke. I know where he is. How? - Because my dad's the one who took him. We'll come get you, hang on. I'm scared. - It's gonna be okay, don't worry. My dad's taking Duke to the dog fight. I really want you to save him. The address is 5200 Dirt Valley Road. The zipcode is 64078. He said it's two miles from town. - Brandon, are you still there? Dad, we've gotta hurry. - Okay, I'll go but you stay here. You stay safe. I'm serious, Paige. I found it. It's the cattle yard out on highway W. - You're never gonna be one of those double zero guys. - What are you doing here? - Getting my dog back. You look like you could use some help. - What about staying safe? - As far as rescue missions go, I called in the troops. - Troops? There are no troops. - There's the PTA. One mom calls another one, then that one calls one-- - Paige, you can not have a bunch of moms come here. These are dangerous man. - Have you seen some of the moms from my school? And you called Detective Brady. - They're coming but we can't wait. All right, stay close to me, okay? - Duke! - Paige. - Hey, buddy. - Get away from my dog. You heard me, back away from my dog. - I don't think so. It's just a dog. Risking your life and her life for a stupid mutt. - He's not just a mutt and he doesn't belong to you. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I think so. Wow, dad, you shot that guy. You're like Batman with bullets. - I'm impressed. Should I ask who decided to call the PTA SWAT team? They're more armed than the special forces. - Thank God for rural America. - You didn't mention you were planning your own raid. - I'm sorry about that. Concussion. - Rita Garland, county animal control. - Is this Duke? - Yes, you need to take him to quarantine? Afraid so. - But. - He's gonna be fine. It's just a precaution. And when he gets out, he's coming home. - You gotta go with this lady but I'll see you really soon. - What's gonna happen to the rest of the dogs? - The rescue team will come and get them the attention and rehab that they need. You two saved them all. So did you use this? - Well, my dad saved us and he only hit the guy a little. - Well if he turns up, we may need to talk officially. - I almost forgot. Brandon. - Who's Brandon? - From my class. His dad is the bad guy. We need to get to his house and make sure he's okay. - No, you give me his address. You two have done enough police work for this evening. You ready? - No. But I'll have a couple days on the road to get there. - Are you disappointed? - No. It was my mistake to try and make my dream into yours. - And my TA, no small shakes, but I love it. - Codeine, huh? - Yeah. - Another new language I'm going to have to figure out. Just when I thought I could talk baseball. - See, I'll always talk baseball with you. Duke wants to talk baseball. - No, Duke wants to eat a baseball. Where's Paige? - Texting Brandon. - What? - There she is. - I'm gonna miss you so much. - I'm gonna miss you too. But we're gonna Face Time and Facebook. You're gonna see my face more than you did when I was here. - I hope so. - You're gonna be okay. Dad's trying. You got Nanna, Duke. And you got Robin. - Yeah. She's pretty cool. - Hey, you can expect the deluxe edition pooper scooper for your birthday. Yeah. Ow. - Something to remember me by. - You're so sweet. Come on.
