Did she call here? She called. Pantelis! Vassiliki Diamandopoulou... How do you do. Cut it out. I haven't had coffee yet, OK? Can anyone drink this coffee? Hand them. Take these. RURAL PRISON OF AGIA Going downtown? I missed the bus. Have to catch a plane. You've called Yannis Klonis' pharmacy. We'll be closed from July 20 until August 16 due to summer holiday. We wish you a nice summer. There's taxis here at the Marketplace. Thanks. Was a pleasure. - Have a nice flight. Thanks. - How much for this? - 250. You don't say, uncle? Gone up that much? - Hey girl, where've you been living? Angry at me for leaving tomorrow? Yes, yes I am. My love, my love... I'm scared. Of losing you again. I had a nightmare again. Some fishermen carried you drowned. It was a fright! Sea weed on your hair. Your eyes were full of sand. I'm scared. It was horrible. They're waiting, I'm late. Why didn't you come? I waited for you all night. Mommy, it's me Rallou. If you drop by and get this, bring me that lipstick with strawberry flavour... also... about grandpa's commemoration feast. Daddy says it's not for children, why not? I loved grandpa more than all of you did. He got me this crocodile shaped plastic balloon and grandma was scared! Don't forget the strawberry lipstick, well, 'bye now, mommy. Are you here or there? I love you. I am where you are. Wherever you go I'm with you. I know. Your soul's here and your body is going on a holiday. And don't you forget the kid's lipstick. Strawberry flavour. BELLE HELENE Hey, careful, don't mess it up! Ship... all over rusty and you... want only name... paint on... Shut it, shark! This name is worth more than all of this. How many years your wife died? Long ago. Lefteris was only 4 then. Four, eh? And you had child Lefteris alone? Alone, me! I brought him up. You know where he is now? No, I don't know. When is television coming? 12, they said. Should have been here already. Where is he? With a nice chick I hope. - Saladin! Boobs! Your mother. What is it? What's he doing here? - Does he know anything? - No. Then why did he come? You told him something? I swear I didn't. I can't see him. Tell him to leave. Grandma! Want a gum? - You were very good. - Thank you. You want her to have a heart attack or what? If she won't set you free... - Lefteris, it's a commemoration fest. - I wouldn't even light one candle. Why did you come? I only have this to say. The deceased never even said "Good morning" to anyone. After finishing with the plane I'll go. Go back with me or you'll never see me again! We're aboard Belle Helene. Gerasimos Mavridis' fishing vessel which his son has turned into a super modern diving vessel. Now... with our channel's support Lefteris sets out every day... to recover... the debris of a great love affair. Good enough? Sets out every day... - To recover the debris etc, go on. Some 25 years ago one of our Air Force pilots crashed his aircraft onto the sea for a woman. Two children were witnesses to this scene but who were those children? Who was that woman, who was the lovesick pilot? Our channel will answer all these within the scope of our daily program "Light in the dark" investigating common people's lives. They got married out of love, right? I speak Greek very well! Putting you on, is she? I thought about that. She's acting real crazy! So, it was a second Trojan War? Eva is settled now, Lefteris. A store, a husband, a child... You're asking too much of her. Know something? I had a hard time figuring out Olga. I don't get it. I didn't get it back then, either. I don't know about then but her longing for you now doesn't mean she'll drop everything and start anew. What the hell does she want? What does she want? What do all women want, Lefteris? Greek, gorgeous Russian ones, Ukranian, Italian... OK Captain, explain to our viewers... Lefteris is now back with you and every day he tries to investigate another great love affair using this vessel named after his unfortunate mother. That's a real mess, nobody will understand anything. Nice music! Well, in the summer we play Arabian Rock! You've made this place very nice. A foreigner, a foreigner? Yeah, he was with Lefteris. Down in the Persian Gulf. Easy child, don't push it... - A drink? - Yes, an ouzo for me, miss. A whisky. A Martini. - What will you have? - A beer. A pineapple juice, if you have it. Pour him a double Bourbon in! I never mix'em. Your Martini. Thank you. The ouzo. To your health, my girl. And here's the beer. Finally I missed the plane. And I thought I'd get around your town some more. I had a haircut! Vicky. Now I recognized you. Yes, it's the hair that got me confused. Lefteris... Larry King is approaching. Get ready. Tomorrow I'll make you famous. All is set, Lefteris. At noon we'll be live on air. Please, miss... As for your money, boy, your friend has seen to it. Hold it. What about the crew? Guys you have to settle things among yourselves. You'll be on TV? Evgenios is doing a little piece for the local station. This is Vicky. She missed a bus and a plane. This is Eugene, formerly Evgenios, a star of the radio scene. A new one? Two to four every day on weekdays, you can dedicate songs to whoever you want. Let us meet a new girl! If you have no one in town you can dedicate to me, sweetie! Where are you from? From Piraeus. A Piraeus girl! She's a Piraeus girl. You know, they're the best gals around! Come by Belle Helene tomorrow and have some ouzo. Who's this Helen? My ship. Tomorrow, how's that for you? My son will be there, too. Why lay it all on his shoulders? He may not have time to spare. No, he is real busy, it's true. Dear captains and all, let the girl serve some landsmen, too. We hadn't been out for some time. You hit the bottle, didn't you? You put some color on you, at last! Commemoration's done, too. I've lost you to the pharmacy for a year now. From tomorrow on we'll finally be together. Still on the FM, still with Eugene offering you the best songs and here's quite a special dedication from Vicky for Salome and the girls back in college. "Half of us good" by Akis Panou for all you staying up with us on this beautiful night. HOLIDAY BREAK Grandma, the crocodile's gone! You know where it is? It's not gone, love. I've put it in the travelling bag. What now, Antonis? - Don't get on her nerves. Let her be. Good morning. Olga? One of her bad days again. She didn't sleep all night. Well, I saw you having real fun, last night. I'll go see her. - No, Jenny. She's locked in. Leave her alone. She'll come tomorrow. Everything ready? How do you know he knows nothing? So why was he at the church yesterday? He must have come with a plan. I swear by my child I never wrote him a word. He never asked about father. Then why is he back after all these years? And why doesn't he ever have a woman with him? How do you know? You're having him watched? He wants you divorced and pretends he's here for a plane. Mom, Lefteris thinks I left him for Antonis. He doesn't know who his father is. He has no demands! Demands? That's outrageous! He's not entitled to... the surname... or to the property or to his sister! Swear it! Swear by your father's bones that you two have not got together again! Forgive us, oh God! - Will you ever stop this drama? I won't swear by anything! You're full of hate! Hate for me and Lefteris, for his mother Helen who took your husband from you, it's vengeance you want! It's you who God will avenge upon for your passion. With your own brother! You don't care for your poor husband at all. Who knows what you're about to do now... I'm sick with worry! If it wasn't for your child... What do you want, woman? Why don't you believe me? Why torture me again? Send him away! That's what I want. Tell him the truth and he'll go. - Why don't you tell him? He's done us enough harm so far. Both he and his mother. Tell him who his real father is! Let me see you. What are you worried about? Money? Why didn't you tell him too, like you told me? Why do I have to go through this? Why crush MY life? And what about my life? What did I do wrong? You're just like your father! Mom? Momina! If it wasn't for this child... Mom! Momina, where are you? Quiet, Rallou. Mommy has a headache. She won't come, then? She will, honey, but don't you be late either. Momina, it's me! You have a headache? I'll be well tomorrow, I swear. Now come here... Sit on the bed, right here... at the edge, lift up your hair... There... Now let me rub you. Is it gone? Do you love me? If you're a good girl, I love you. If not? I still do. Even if am not...? Even then. If not.... what? If not... Then don't. That's from that game... If not... oh well...then don't... You see? Then don't, oh well... If not. Hey you, there... Now, run... - Tomorrow, right? - Tomorrow. Your hat! Bye! Hurry now, Rallou! Come on, love. Oh well, I bounced back alright. Right. Salome called me. How about staying here for a month or a week... Well, I could always give a hand... You don't live off the cue anymore, right? Hadn't played for 2 years. I needed practice. You did OK last night. So, you'll stay near me at the counter and Nicolas will serve on tables. You still need a couple of nights' training. Well, I don't want to cause trouble with your man. How about it? 10 a night plus tips. One day off? That's the limit. Thing is, I wouldn't go to a hotel. Coppers may bug me, you know when you come out of college they won't leave you in peace. Rooms are like cells, too. No prob. Leo is one of ours. - Who? - The Commander. But I have no place for you. How about here? In the bar? Well, there by the records? I have a sleeping-bag. I'll be just fine. I need some space around me. Suits me fine. If you say so... But just for a few days. I won't stay long anyway. Any cash in advance? I never touch my pocket before noon, child. Be patient. Someone left a message for you. Who did? A Hairy Guy, you know him? I used to. You care for that message? You caught it. Ladies and gentlemen, today we will attempt a journey together back to the summer of 1973. An aircraft of our Air Force attempts a series of spectacular manoeuvres over the houses at the cape and ends down into the sea. The aircraft sinks on the spot and neither it nor the pilot have ever been found. Two little children playing at the time on a beach nearby witnessed with their own eyes this tragic event. One of these children was Lefteris Mavridis and we have him here with us at the studio today. Welcome, Lefteris. - Good morning. How exactly did those events take place? It was almost sundown, Markos saw the aircraft heading towards us... And? At the last minute, as it flew over the villa we saw it moving towards the sea. Suddenly, it goes up to the sky. It reaches an endpoint, makes a swift turn and falls straight into the water. That's fabulous! That means that he formed a huge Lamda shape, her name! A nice jerk he was! She lived her sweet life and he was eaten by the fish. That's love's doings. Hey, just look at this! Look whom I hit by hitchhiking! Hitchhiking? Didn't I tell you? That's how I met Lefteris. How? I was hitchhiking, early morn. Lefteris didn't stop. Fortunately, some cattle passed... Hey, that's me! Aah, it's gone... Will you ever find that plane? You're in a hurry, eh? Sea big, plane small, how to... A boy of 20... he left his native town to look for his luck at sea. And he found it! He was trained in diving by American experts and the last three years he also worked in the Persian Gulf cleaning of the last war's shipwrecks. Now... it is finally time for the lost aircraft. Lefteris remembers. We'd heard that an aviator was in love with the girl who lived in the house but she didn't want him. He had caused enough trouble, he was crazy. Finally? I was with my friend Markos, we were kids then, we were at the cape, playing Indians... How are my pals doing? Everything Okay? Where did you get all those? What, we have a visitor? A guest! We saw you on TV. You delivered, man! We got them! Now get this. - It's Marlon Brando! - Pals, no more fooling around. We must finish by the end of the month or go to hell. We've got paid in advance. - Good! I think I'll split now. The boss may need me. Only dogs have bosses. Let me help you. - Bye Vicky. - Bye all. And remember, I'll provide the vehicle. Thanks. Bye. Bye! I thought I'd give her that Solex bike I have in store, remember it? So that she moves around. This cassette we take with us America? What for? To show it to agent and... So, what's the idea? Are you a captain or a matchmaker? What is ...matchbaker? Today, all happens right on camera. Wars, robberies, cheats... Our private affairs... Now hold it! This was out of personal interest. Mine and Markos's dream. Right but the boys here are not exactly BBC. It's a local channel. Hey, early drinkers, I see. That was left on your windscreen. - What is it? Children playing, perhaps. Come back here, you fool! Why are you undressing me? It's a game. It's played like this. No clothes on. - None at all? Whatsoever. How is it played? It's played... no clothes on. - No? Not one piece? Not one, right? And who wins? Who wins? I'm happy. You're my girl... I'm yours. I love you. Come. Like this. You like that? I want to look at you. Look at you... My girl... Lefteris... Lefteris... My Olga... Why didn't you write to me all these years? I did. I just didn't dare send them. Didn't dare... Right. I considered you lost. I can't afford losing you again. You may hate me for it some day. I don't want to lose you. Truth is that you want it all your way, Olga. A husband for socializing and a lover for hiding. You said whatever I say. Say then. What do you want? Dunno. But I do know. Listen. It's our man. The hell with it! I asked him to help me find it... All this time, he hasn't set foot here. Here you have all thing old... What you want old thing? You see I promised the girl that Solex. Me at my home out there Port Said is all thing old but sell it... Man is value, not... thing. Lefteris knows, he's come my home Post Said he has stayed 3 months with leg plaster after accident in Persian I do your child well... I know Saladin, if it wasn't for you... Want me speak something? Lefteris loves danger. I love danger also but... I love life too. I would have sold everything too. But... All these were hers. It's because I don't want to admit I lost her. This is us in Poros. Married for one year. Beautiful woman. You bet. Belle Hélène herself! You too beautiful, captain. What was I compared to her? She walked like a partridge. I couldn't believe she would ever look at me. That's where we'll stop. Where? Right here. No, Lefteris, there's too much sand here. It can't have moved up to here. Why not? You know the currents here? As strong as they may be I don't think so. The deep is full of currents here. It doesn't hold anything down. Tell us something new, Captain. That baby Solex... I finally found it in the storeroom and gave it to your Cretan friend. Drop by and check it out. OK, I will. Well, I promised the girl, so don't neglect it. No, no I'll go. Irene love! Check the fish in the kitchen... Go on, say it. She hasn't left. The pharmacy's closed but she's here. A busybody, are you? Hold this. Yes? Still there? We worried about you. I went to pick you up but... Yeah, I wasn't there. Your mother says I should come over. Is there a problem? No, I'm fine! Still some shopping to do. Did you finish it? Yes. Don't hang up. The little one wants you. Mom... You hear me, mom? It's Rallou. Hello, honey. Did you find your friends? Yes, I did. Listen, mommy. I want a swimsuit with a... with an opening on the sides. All my girlfriends have one like it. Yes, baby. I'll get you one. When will you be here? Missed me already? What are you doing there alone? Rallou, give it to me, I want to talk to her. Olga? Olga! How about a swim, babe? No way, I can't swim. I'll take you where... the bottom's right! Now boys... The body shop of Zaharias the Cretan... That's the one. Are you a customer? Isn't Lefteris here? The diver? Yes, him. - Lefteris! - No such luck! Look this way, mister... Good morning! Your father sent me. It's ready. Is it now? Does this thing work? Sure! - Where's the gears? - What gears? Pull this down and you're set. And it rolls? Sure it does, if you ride it. Some article! Cool! It was yours, wasn't it? Must have rolled quite a bit! Take this! Careful. I'll take my ride now. Take good care of it. Easy on it, eeh! Careful, Vicky! It has no petrol. You'll run out soon! Sorry I'm late. That little shit let me down. Which one? Cpt. Gerasimos' scooter. That's an antique! I'll give it back to Lefteris to fix. - Be careful with him. - I am. You can sit if you like. We're open. No...thanks. I'm looking for a friend, so... Saladin! Is Lefteris with you? No, he... Fuck, the Solex is broken. Lost your tongue? Lefteris! What do you want? Where's Lefteris? Why won't you leave him alone? None of yours. Tell me, where is he? Want to destroy him? Why not let him lead his life? He could find a proper woman. Yeah, I'm no proper woman. You're right. A proper woman will ask him for a family... his name... children, a home... Well, I... You have a child to raise. Don't mention my child. And he? Shouldn't he make a family? Why Gerasimos? Did you ever miss not having a child of your own? Didn't you enjoy life with your Belle Helene? We'll enjoy it too! No one can deprive us of this. Anywise... Everything's a lie. A lie? There's two persons I've loved in all my life. Is that a lie? You've based your life on a lie. You're trying to keep him with a lie. You fear he may know the truth one day. You and my father sent him away back then. But now... This time I won't let anyone take him from me. It's me who'll stop you. I'll talk to him. - You can't. - I'll tell him all about it. - You'll lose him if you do! Hey, girl... Why hit the knife? Forget him. If you really love him... you must let go. What are you saying now, Gerasimos? All these years... I got married. Had a child. I can't. I live for no one else but him. Just like you do. Let us... Don't tell him anything. Let us both have him. What are you doing here? Chatting with your father. What about? I'm telling him about his daughter. How she's got me confused. He... He's not involved in any way. I thought you had gone. Saladin told me you're here. He saw you at a bar. Yeah, where... I just dropped by. Are you well? I'm fine. I'm leaving tomorrow. Is that what you came to ask? You didn't like me coming to say goodbye? How did you get in? Like a thief. Did you find... anything valuable? No, nothing until you came in. I know what you're thinking. Not a difficult thing to guess. You're thinking that... I've compromised, that... I've changed. That I'm not... as you knew me, anymore. Yes, but the fact is... when we're making love you're my girl, I can feel that. Just as you were then. That's what I want to be. Lefteris' girl. Carefree, easy-going. Yes, I remember. You did very well, too. Finally you blew it, though. You chose family happiness with Antonis. No, no, I wasn't the one who chose it. You... You disappeared... I didn't even know... - So you asked your father. Ask him again. Tell him... Dad... I'm still in love with Lefteris. What shall I do? A little wash... You haven't laid the diver yet? Boss, do I ever ask you what you do with Nicolas? I wasn't on a diet for two years. Unless you're waiting for that other one. Yes, I am. But I'm not keeping it for him. He came here last night. Scared? Of him? When we played together I always took the lead. He can only sing out of tune. You played together? Then you were a couple. It was an act. What sort of an act? I played ignorant. There was betting, money mounted up... And finally my guy would lose and we'd rip them off. Fifty-fifty. Did he teach you the cue? Yes. But I paid him off alright. Two and a half years. And Lefteris? Don't tell him anything. He has nothing to do with it. He's different. - Bah! Come on, they're all alike. Yes, but don't tell him about Hairy Guy etc. Captain Gerasimos! Father! Where are you? What's up, Captain? Are you alright? You came, did you? You sure had to. This is your mother's house. Your house. You're drunk. I got the picture. The sun got you too. You and your wines... You left us with no captain today. Remember? That Sunday... when you almost drowned with the stolen boat, eh? Remember? - Yes, I do. - Some saint helped us. - Let's get inside now. Sail without me today. I trust you with the vessel. I'm not to hold a wheel now. I can see that. I can't see why you brought me here. I brought you to your own house, I did. But you... You came here for other things. Hey old man. You can't hold your liquor, you know that? Well, okay. Stay and rest today. You'll tell me about it tomorrow. I shouldn't waste the day. Tomorrow, well... Take this box with you, it has your late mother's things in it. It was rotting here so... - What is this? Her stuff, I don't know. I just put them all in. Look for yourself. - I can't do it now. - Take it all the same. They're your things now. You don't come here every day. Don't go out into the sun. Lie down, okay? See you tomorrow. Bye now. Bye. Well, I'll be! Who's she? What's up, pretty? No sense knocked in you yet? Don't lose your style, Hairy Guy. What's done is done. What's done's done and what'll be will be. Are you game? A whole night, you know... And me? Your cue. I win, you forget about it. Heads, I play first. Saw it. Noooo... Your turn. Stelios... Hey, she's way beyond... Where did she learn that? I'll take her as a teacher. Hairy Guy... We missed out on an unforgettable night! Take all! Carnival '63 Hristos, will you ever bring the bread? Coming, you nag! Hey! Are we raising the birdie or what? We watched him on TV and he's snooty ever since! He sure is! Thanks for a kind word. Last night we went out and drank till morning. We spent our last dime, too. - On music and dancing. That Poulis sure knows how to play the bouzouki. And here's our starry girl. - Morning, boys! - Are they ready? - Coming up. Get a glass. Kostas is getting into the oven to get you one. You don't say! You closed the bar now? Yes, I came for a cheese pie before bedtime. How's your dad? Is he OK? He's fine, I'm going there now. Shall I come, too? In case you need any help. Shall I? - Won't you go to bed? - I'm awake now. I've gathered enough sleep for the rest of my life. - Cheers! - Cheers! Only I have to go change for a moment. Now what is this? You set a date in my bakery? I bump into him wherever I go! Playing hard to get, is he? It's hot. Let me help or you’ll burn your lips. Put the rest in or we'll lose them too. Give it another try. It's nothing, you'll get over it. It'll pass before you get married. - Give her one more... And what will you do when you find the plane? What? I mean, say that you find that airplane... Then? I'll leave. I'll go find some more serious work to do. - Ready. - What's this? My charm. Charm? Yes, it brings me luck. You find it strange? I've made it myself. You like it? Looks okay. Can you make me one, too? I'll give you this one. Even if it doesn't work, you may at least remember me by it. Remember you, why? You're leaving? You said you were leaving. But I'm not here for keeps either, as you see. I like knowing that I can hit the roads any minute. We're here! Wow, what a mansion! My, my! Hello, Captain! Hello, pretty girl! Welcome both! Many happy returns! Live to be a hundred! Let's drink to your health. - We will... Isn't it your birthday today? Birthday? Who told you so? - Come on, while they're cold. May your son and you be happy! Morning! Happy birthday! Happy birthday to me, then! Thank you. These should stay here. They're better off here. Agreed? I also found the cigars for you. Remember? The light ones I brought you from America? Here's to your father's health! Thank you! Cheers! Here's to him! Quite a spot! You can't get near here in wintertime. Too windy! You came here as a child? Yeah, fishing with friends. - Brought chicks here too? - Nope. You had no girlfriend? No, I was shy then. Now you're brave enough to bring chicks here, right? I haven't been here with a woman. And now? Now what? You... I mean now, don't you have a woman? How are you coping? - Married ones mostly. Right. Married ones are perfect. Their husbands save you all the trouble. How about you? Me... Neither married nor unmarried ones. Why, were you kept in a monastery? In a cell. In the rural prisons, near here. Someone snitched on me. Someone, well... My guy. We had just got engaged. He gave me to save himself. What did you think? Only the Persian Gulf has sharks? Was it a robbery? He was involved with ancient findings. He had me carry them out. Icons and such? Look at this. See? Yes. Unique earrings. Four different clips they had. I just wore them and I went through baggage check easy! Real nice ones! Worth millions! But thirty months, no way... Why a swallow? You don't know? The only bird that cannot be trained. You're a tough nut, after all, eh? A nut is tough on the outside. I'm tough inside, don't be fooled. Alright. I'll be careful. I'll be careful. I've lost my touch... You know how to get it back? I feel like screaming. Scream, then. No, I won't, I won't! My charm! I lost my charm! - Are you sure? - It's gone down. - When? - Just now, kissing and all... Lefteris, find it! OK, hold it. I'll lose it! Please, Lefteris! Find it. I found it! You got it? I found it! Antonis... I know I'm a coward to... be talking through the cassette player but... I have no other way. I'm leaving! There's another man in my life. I don't know if... I'm going to be happy far from you... I think of you a lot, I think of... the child... Tell mom that I'm not asking her to forgive me. But with Rallou... if possible, please don't make her... ...hate me... - That's the one. - You have a 19? Yes, I do. Under the drawer. Today I came. It was my turn. I must tell you. I thought all day... - Olga... The other night... Listen to me, after you left... I measured the whole thing. Stop it, Olga. It's not worth it. What's not worth it? My life started again when you returned. I've made up my mind. I'll do whatever you want. I want you to be happy. With me you won't be. Don't blow it all up. Can't you see? I don't even have a house! You don't believe me. I'm getting a divorce. Take me where you're going. I can't live another moment away from you. Can't be done. I've thought things over, too. Everything has an end. It was our mistake. A childish idea. What happened? What's with you? What changed all of a sudden? There's another woman, is that it? Look... Whoever you're involved with... Either she'll dump you or you her. It's only me who'll be with you. Forever. Say you don't love me! Say it and I'll believe it. Say it, I want to see this. Olga? Get into your car. Go down and catch the last ferry. And go back to your family. Right now. Leave. No! You have her here! Go away! My son doesn't want you. Don't you see? It's his decision. Now off to your folks, too. I said it's his decision. The old man's right. HELEN MAVRIDIS DECEASED 1966 FAMILY Easy, eeh? You want we go back again Americans? I think so. Right, let's set the whole thing on fire, shall we? I knew. I knew you'd come, baby. Baby... My baby... I knew it. Hey, say... When did we get here? I can't remember. Doesn't matter... A perfect spot, this one. You like it? You do, eh? You woke up? Why not have a shower? Not a soul around here. Want some? - What's this? Muesli. What's Olga to you? Sorry, but... You talk in your sleep. And when did I sleep? When you did. An old story. Who knows how many old stories you've brought here? That's enough. Fine. A penthouse on wheels. Wheels are important. So you can split when you like. Same here. - Good morning. - That's classic style, isn't it? Wouldn't you rather have a modern haircut, short is modern, like Denisi? Boyish haircut's not my style. Easy, Pitsa! I'm sorry. Yeah, you're sorry... I'm off in a week's time. Say, Giorgos... Why don't you keep the cue? Against my leaving so suddenly. Are we running away? After trying so hard to get round him. These things don't last. They're good while they last. Then they go off. Well, you have a point there. What's love? Why do we fall in love? Let's hear it. Love is... like a prison. In prison you know when you can walk in and out of your cell... but in this prison? For example, your Hairy Guy. He loves you still. He does, eh? Don't tell me about the other one. I know. You told me you'll go away together. - Yeah. - And? How can I put it? His mind's elsewhere. Another woman? Let me look at you. We're like a wedding couple. ...but we didn't give up trying... And you sure know why not. For you, dear friends... That's it! That's it! What are you looking for, Captain? I thought of offering the boys some of those cigars. We made it, didn't we? That is, you made it. Patience is what it took. What shall we do with this now? It takes up my whole deck. Evgenios will take it, we agreed. What about the money? You'll send it to me by mail. Will you take the girl with you tomorrow? Gerasimos... Tell me, does Olga know we're siblings? She knows. For long? Her folks told her after you left. People know nothing. She kept silent about it all those years. Don't look further into it. Better make a life for yourself and the girl. Or another girl. Whoever you want. But don't you forget... You're leaving home back here. Look, they're stripping... Vicky, you grew tall or what? It's alright, I'm fine! Let me go in myself! Good night! Hey, uncle... Are you free? I am. Where to? Let's go. I'll tell you on the way. Alright. Off we go. Who is there? Olga! Olga, no! Stop! Stop it, we'll get killed! Are you mad? Olga stop! I love you, I know everything! Lefteris!
