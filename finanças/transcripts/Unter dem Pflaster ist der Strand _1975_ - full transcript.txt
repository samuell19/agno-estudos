UNDER THE PAVEMENT LIES THE STRAND These actresses act out... the rule of women, as it was thousands of years ago, and its abolition ordained by men. These women you have brought here, I will sell the lot as slaves, as soon as I have put an end... to the beating of the drums. Or set them working on the loom. OK, that'll do. Five minute break. As the TV recording is during the day, they have time in the evening... to think over their roles as women. Grischa, for instance, was in a film yesterday... about abortion, with a discussion afterwards. There are possibilities. We're not living in an entirely totalitarian system. As far as women's matters are concerned, you are way out. There are 32 million women in Western Germany, that is, more than half the population. But hardly a thing is done about women's problems. As a journalist, I know it's very hard... trying to get articles on women's matters accepted. There's never enough room for such material. Women are not going to take this lying down. I only wish they would hit back. The men here in Berlin often complain... that we shut them out. It's about time... men started talking about their problems, about their sexual difficulties and fears... and not expect us... to emancipate them along with ourselves. That's the role we always had to play, saviours in distress. I quite agree with you. If women start thinking about themselves, men get upset. This desperate struggle for what is taken for granted by men, and which often seems in vain because it looks... as if most women... were satisfied with their private happiness.. and keep on supporting men... in their wars and rivalries. The worst is that the struggle... takes place on two fronts: the private and the public. Plus the difficulty of expressing oneself. What wildness is in Enthuse, born of earth and sprung... from the dragon's side. Daughter of the river of rivers. Achinco's source, Dirka. Once you receive into your waves... the newborn son of Zeus, Dionysius. The father of bliss, benefactor of mortals, of whom it is said... he makes fertile the steed-rich land... with plentiful waters. Where are the others? Gone already? What are you sitting around for? I don't know. Don't feel like going home? Your husband's at home, isn't he? Had a row? What's that got to do with it? What's wrong, Grischa? I'd like to see an end... of the separation of private life and job. What I do on the stage is what I need, you see. What I say comes from deep within me, and, of course, it comes out stronger on stage. Then, suddenly someone says: Thank you, you can go home. But you have no ties with home, having lived here for fourteen hours. Of course, no one's interested. You understand? I understand that, but nevertheless... we have to change it. I must do something where I can always be at work. I sometimes think... that we learn when we... act like that, the way our consciousness changes. Then we think the world could change and improve.. much better than it can. Then we expect big things, and it's all saved up for a couple of hours... per evening, then nothing. Of course, this is the dream, a pipe dream. We want to walk on air. I mean, you have to find a job... that you have to keep working on. -Isn't that asking too much? -Why? There are limits in our society to jobs... that remain continually demanding. There's bosses and money, time and space, people plank down their 12 marks... for two hours at a play. And that's as far as it goes for most people. I'd like a job... that I could get my teeth into too, where I am not just disposable. -You probably won't find it. -Yes, you just have to try. Castles in the air. No, Heini. Why don't you go home? Why don't you? Why not? I practically never go home. I leave here and usually go boozing pretty hard. Lay off boozing. It doesn't pay. I wouldn't know what to do at home. It's all so empty. The few happy days we spent together... seem to ooze from the walls... and it hurts. It tears at your guts. On the surface I have everything, a phone, radio, books, the dogs, but I don't know what to do there. In the evening, I like sitting in the pub, all alone in the corner, watching people and hitting the bottle... till I sometimes keel over. I don't think it's always that way. Hey, I think they've locked us in. What do you mean? They must all have gone. I'll have a look. They wouldn't just leave us like that. Well, that's a lark. You can't be serious. It's shut. They can't do this. It's crazy. And the window? We could smash it, I suppose. It's bolted. I don't like this at all. Let's go see. Don't laugh like that! We're here for the night. I'll have a look. You already have. Shall we bed down here? There must be a window we can get out of. We have the place to ourselves. We'll simply stay. -We can sleep. -A trick! A what? Come off it, Grischa. You know very well. Aren't you tired? Be quiet! Shut up! Stow it! Stop it, will you? Call that funny? You can't expect me to laugh. Beat it! Grischa, come on! Come on. I'm a fool, you're a fool, so let's die the death, shall we? Come, come. Come, lady, come. Like some beer? You know, you look just like my sister. My sister's dead. Her name was Gisela. She died when I was four. She was fifteen. She was killed. She once took me to the Rhine on her bike. I sat in front in a basket and fell asleep. When I woke up, she pressed me close to her. You really look like my sister. Let's sleep together. No, I don't want to. Elease! Elease. In Heinrich's mind always the hope... that remained unfulfilled with the many... because they were too few and not tenacious enough; hope of fulfilment with one person, taking up the struggle, with love a revolution for two. We can cut there. See you not the fire, see you not the flame about Semele's... sacred grave? The flame left by him struck by lightning, the flame of Zeus' thunder. Down to earth, down with trembling bodies, turning everything over, striding. After the war? We weren't any better off. At that time we played in the ruins, too. I think it was spring of 1969, the great demonstration before the courthouse, the Mahler demonstration. After that, of course, we thought, tomorrow we strike, tomorrow's Revolution Day in West Berlin. Eure castles in the air! We seized the water cannon... and drowned the pigs with it. Then they threw smoke bombs at us, and the wind was in our favour, so they got the smoke full in their kissers. Then they let us go our way. We marched triumphant to the university... and made love behind the stage in the big hall. We thought, tomorrow's the day, but nothing happened. A pity. Nowadays we've crawled back into our shells, each one goes to his pub alone... You are wrong. They still get together like in 68. True, but in small groups, I don't like this fragmentation. I didn't attend any demos last May 1st. I sat at home and... I think that's just what's wrong. The thing's going on, and it won't stop. I have friends among the thingummies - the Revisionists and Communist Earty. Where can I turn? I feel pretty isolated, too. But doing nothing... We were united in 68, 69. I remember in 67, they tried to arrest Rudi... at the Easter March. I happened to be around... when the pigs in plain clothes... tried to drag him into a car. That was great. You lived in utopia so much. As if revolution could happen now. We thought there was a silver lining. -You can't give it up now. -I believed. But what's to come of this fragmentation? You have to tackle the questions in your mind again, but more cautiously. But forget about dreams of revolution tomorrow. That's plain stupid, that's where you go wrong. Do you have a light? Basically, you're unhappy... that things don't jell. I can understand you not wanting... to join a party. I think it's a pity, too. But it's no reason for opting out, just because you can't make up your mind... which left wing party is right for you. But how can you carry on alone? You have to go, haven't you? Come on, doggies, food! George! Chew on it, Ben. Don't swallow, you hog! I had to climb over the boxes. Did you phone just now? I'd like to sleep with you. Not at my place. I can't stand it. Mine's no good, either. I'm busy packing. Let's try G?nter's place in Clausewitzstrasse. I'm coming. Hi, G?nter! How long is Andreas going to be away? Andreas? Till Saturday or Sunday. This is Grischa. This is G?nter. Want to go in now? See you later, then. Come, sit. I'm afraid I have my period. Ever heard the story of Leila and Madschnun? It's an oriental fairy tale, known to all oriental peoples. It's the story of the love of Leila and Madschnun. Madschnun, the madman, doesn't get her, because the girl's father has forbidden the marriage... and has locked the girl up. Madschnun went crazy and went off to the wilderness. He composed Love poems to his Leila. This made the love story known everywhere, which made her father more determined to spike it. One day, an Oriental king heard of this love... and wanted to see Madschnun. His scouts found him in the desert... and took him to the king. I have heard a lot about you, Madschnun, said the king. I like your poems very much. But I don't understand why you are so in love. I just don't believe it. So Madschnun recited him a few love poems. The king wanted to see leila, too, and sent for her. Then he saw she was an ordinary nomad, and each of his 360 wives in his harem was lovelier. So he told him so. And Madschnun replied: If you had my eyes, you could see her beauty. He bound thongs... about his knees, about his hips. Snorting with excitement... Sweat dripping from his every limb. His teeth biting into his lips... And I, close by, sat calmly there and watched. Finally he desisted from his toil, thinking I had fled, and seized a sword, a black sword. A sword... a black sword. Lovely with you. I'll give you a baby. -Do you want a baby? -No. -Do you want a baby? -No. -Do you want a baby? -No. You're invited to tea. What are you sitting like that for? Completely stoned. My, they're in a hurry! China is a long way. Not as far as you think. Now everything seemed possible to him, as long as they were together. Love, and a child to cement that love, and a political struggle for them and the others, to make love useful. What are you doing with the chicken? It's not a chicken, it's a rooster. I'll put the chicken in the kitchen. -Leave it here. -Let go. Excuse me, I have to clear up. -Shall I help you? -No. What will we do now? Why? What should we do? What's the next step, Heinrich? What's the next step, Grischa? Stop parroting me. It's like in a nursery school. Tell me. But don't step on it. Shall I take off my shoes? Why did you say recently you wanted a child? Tell me. Tell me. Seriously. Really. Well, sometimes I think I'd like a child. Why? Of course, I'd really like one of my own, Like Zeus did out of his thigh. You must be realistic about it. I'd like a child from you. What will you do then? You'd have to devote time. I have time. I have no time for a baby. That would mean cutting back terribly on one's... own demands. What would you do with a child? Live with it. Have you any definite idea? No, it's something new, a new experience. Quite different. I don't believe one can imagine it. But why a child from me? Because I'm fond of you. As Grischa's fear dimmed, so her confidence.. in the work she had undertaken grew. How do you combine your private Life with your job? I'm afraid I have no time, have to get home to the kids. That's too bad. So she just started, somewhere, distrusting any kind of advice. To break down the barriers between her... and the working women, she began to ask questions. She wanted to learn from them, without intermediaries, and found them surprisingly frank, though they usually had no time to spare. She felt lost outside the factory... and longed for the protection of some organization. On the other hand, she believed only her own senses... and wanted to know how far they would take her. Do you have children? Two daughters, one's still studying... and the other's married in Switzerland. My daughter's a student in Marburg. Just now I'm on my own. Do you manage with your daughter at university? I've had to do without Lots of things, but I don't mind because she's got brains. Grischa saw she had a lot to learn, not only from these working women, but from the history of women's oppression. Slave, cheap workers, willing to confront, even to self-sacrifice, but also to fight and resist. She didn't wish to fight against Heinrich, but with him, but at any rate for herself. Just imagine, you get on so well living with someone... that you really ask for very little. I'd rather have a surprise. But you have desires which, if you live with a woman, do not present themselves, and so you're unhappy. What are desires like? Not concrete. But what seems to be Iacking all the time? I know it's utopian to expect... everything to run smoothly, for people to understand each other without a word, for the other person to know when you're sad. Sometimes it works. I think it might be that way with you. Really? That would be fine. It's already happened a few times. That's why I'm here, aren't I? Mrs. Berg, you're a working woman? I work as a commercial employee. How do you manage with the kids? My husband takes them to kindergarten. He's still a student, so he can do it in the morning. I have to start work at seven. He usually fetches them home at the evening. So he's doing the housewife's work? Have you ever had an abortion? Yes, twice. Before I had the kids. I had a boyfriend and wanted to marry. I didn't know what to do with a baby, besides which, I was young, and my parents... didn't want me hawking an illegitimate baby around. If a woman who works has children, she does all the looking after. Does your husband find housework rather wearing? He's got to like it or Iump it. He studies, and I work all day. So he has to do it, and he does willingly. How can you solve conflicts at your place of work? I am a shop stewardess, elected by my workmates. There's tension among the women here, and I try to smooth things out... by discussing with the women why things are like that. I try to establish good relations especially because... they're often in conflict with their husbands. They work all day and hardly see their husbands, and when they get home at night... there's friction, because they're both nervous. I talk these problems over with them... and tell them why it works out that way. This Iovely story of a love... that dissolved into a mirage, convinced me that life is an illusion, and that the most wonderful stories, which dissolve like bubbles in dirty water, are only there to instill in us... revulsion against life. Only in deliberate collectivity, in the struggle for socialist aims, can divorce be no longer the start of utter Ioneliness... I never understood what love of a female soul... had to do with the crude... business of reproduction. Love fools people to make them procreate. Shut up, will you! But of voluntary relations of solidarity... Shut up, I want to read you something. I was not born for domestic life, and then it happened. Did you understand? To live your life, you have to hurt other people. And help women take up work... outside the home without... a guilty conscience, and get men used... to not seeing women as stupid, shoddy competitors... who had better look after the house. Stop that noise! How can you work in this mess? What's up? I don't get it. Did you alter that? I didn't do a thing. Have you ever had an abortion? I want children, all right, but at this time... it just wasn't possible. Yes, it was last year. I really wanted kids. I was pregnant, and so we got married. Then I had a miscarriage, and became pregnant again. That wouldn't work out, job-wise. Then I had trouble with Eeter, and I didn't want to have a baby just then, because my job was all Ioused up. It would have been nice, but I thought... the child would probably suffer a lot. It's all so stupid... I did think of going back to school, but I don't know if it would help much. I'd probably first get a school certificate. But that's a dead end just now. And after school? Maybe I'd study. I can see I'm interested in subjects... that not much is known about yet, especially concerning women. That would be very interesting. In some things they're only just starting, but I'd like to do that. Finding out howfar psychology takes account of women. Human beings in psychology so far are simply men, and the second chapter is all about women, which seems to be the wrong way around, more or Iess. I took up Freud for a time. That's when I became aware of it. I think what he writes is really controversial. He Ieaves women out, Oedipus complex and so on. What he writes about women, you know, about them needing a vaginal orgasm, and if they don't, they're immature... I know, because I've talked to a lot to women... and really got close to them, I know from experience that's not true. What a woman tells me, is, I believe, truer than what Dr. Freud says about women. AIso, because I'm a woman myself. Did you have particular problems as a child, because you were a girl? I couldn't exactly say problems, but my upbringing was very much guided... by my being a woman. I was taught everything about housekeeping. At seven or eight years, I had to cook and clean. I'm the eldest of six sisters, and I have two elder brothers, who were brought up quite differently. My most decisive experience was sex, I feel. In our home it was completely taboo. No one ever spoke about it. I grew up in a Catholic village. I was more or Iess seduced before I was five... by a 65-year old man. I had to keep seeing him, because I was afraid of him. I knew it was the greatest sin you could commit. That Iasted till I was seven. It was very hard for me. It preoccupied me even as an adult, and I could never go to confession, I knew that confession would have freed me somehow, I couldn't, because the priest was a friend of my parents... and he'd have told them. I was terribly afraid someone would find out. About that time, you see, a 14-old girl had sexual relations... with an older man, and she was sent to a reformatory, and he went to jail. I heard about that. Then the old man died, and I was really glad, but I couldn't afford to show it. This gave me a curious attitude to male sexuality. For me it represents a strong threat, and I was really scared of it. Somehow, you slip into the role of a victim... and then you have to make sure... you try to establish... satisfactory sexual relations. Could you talk to anyone about this? My husband was the first person. I was afraid people would shun me... if I told them about it. You see, what I did is so awful, though I didn't really do it myself, that I never spoke about it. That is a picture of how I felt... as a child, and my attitude to sex, and all that happened to me. You know, I've been taking the pill for seven years now, and now... I Iearn from doctors and friends... that it can make you sterile. I think that's pretty awful. So now I've given it up. Then I became pregnant again, which was an impossible situation for me... No need to run the water, Heinrich. What shall I do, then? I can't hear. Stop it. I have to write this down now. I can't concentrate. ...because they're afraid of breaking down. Because, when the children get back from kindergarten... they are nervous, the parents are nervous, and... that causes friction. Then comes the problem of women... trying to sit there in the evening and study.. Let go. What's wrong? Can't you Iet me do my work? What am I supposed to do? Do something on your own. Let's do something together. You don't have to play housewife. All you do is your own crap. It's important, don't you see? What is it to me? Now listen to this! Women's lib! I feel cold. I have to get on. Forget that crap! I really wanted children. I was pregnant, so we got married... Leave that alone! What's gotten into you? Now I have to start all over again. If something's eating you, say so, but calmly, without getting on my nerves. Did you write this? "Do you have time or the urge to do things... with your husband, such as a movie, play or a walk?" Don't make yourself ridiculous! You're always wanting to do things, aren't you? Some people just haven't got time. You seem to have too much. Stop it! I can't stand it. ...it would have been nice, but I thought... the child would probably suffer a lot. Do you know what the story's about? Shall I tell you? There's a workman. He and his woman friend have been living together some time. Then he realizes that he and his mates... have got to help themselves. So he goes in for political activity, but all... the girl wants is to be happy with him. And then he Ieaves her, just because she won't pull her weight politically. Why not Iet me rot? I won't Iet you rot. You understand? Don't be so gloomy. Do something! I couldn't confess, either. The priest was a friend... of my parents, and... he would have told them. I was really scared that someone would find out. About that time, a 14-year old girl... was having a sexual affair with an older man. She was sent to reformatory, and he to jail. The old man died. I was so glad... ...I was so glad... but I didn't dare show it. That gave me a peculiar attitude to male sexuality. It was always a threat... Heini, Heini. It's so stupid. A zebra and a gnu, a rare sort of Ioving couple, walk down the street and on and on, into the endless steppes, the vast spaces, like the garden of Eden. In between, they take a breather... in a beautiful garden, taking it easy. In this garden. Is it far to the sea? About 380 kilometers. If you stand on the heights and gaze into this country, you see giraffes and elephants standing around, all so peacefully... The little wart-hog family was delightful, trotting along in single file, mother in front, father behind, his curlytail in the air. What time is it? Two fifteen. What's the book? Origin of the Family. Why not Eersian fairytales? It's practicallythe same. How are things? Not too bad. Okay. Okay? How about Grischa? Let's forget that, shall we? I'm tired of play-acting. Everything we started, thinking... we could improve things... Well, nothing came of it. We tried to change things through the theatre. Nothing happened at all. Grischa would like to act, so would I. Your own show? I have quite different ideas. I'm not so stuck on politics. I think it's arrogant for an actor to go... and tell workers what it's all about. I'd like a kind of folk theatre, something like I've seen the French doing. Like "Theatre du Soleil." OId time? Yes, something people get a kick out of. But I don't know how to tackle it. Doing things for fun is also important. I understand you wanting your freedom. I want mine, too. But you won't be freer by being alone. It's something different. You just have... to discover a new way of life, right? I know I've made mistakes, but we can change that. If we separate for a few days, it'll be all right perhaps. Hey, you? Say something! Say something! Hey, you. Heinrich. I'm expecting a baby. I'm so terribly happy. I always wanted a child. And you? You're always talking about wanting one. You're not a mother, you know. What'll we do if things don't work out between us? What'll we do with the baby? I'd like to go on working. But how can we do it alone? It won't work, will it? Tell me if it will work or not! It just won't work out! It won't... not with you, either. I'm absolutely sure... that the main thing is to stick together, for the baby... Here's a field, and there's another field. That sets up tension, and you act differently... than if the other field wasn't there. Then you can act together. You weigh up... Sometimes it gets really sadistic. I wouldn't want that. Okay, so you wouldn't! I'd like to speak to Dr. Siebert, please. Where is she, then? At the demonstration... And where's that? Thank you. Earagraph 218 has existed since 1871. In the Weimar Republic, a proletarian women's group... was formed to combat the abortion Iaw. Abortions increased considerably after World War I, though usually after wars... births tend to rise. The poverty of working class families was too dire... to enable them to support Iarge families. Bourgeois society insisted... on abortion being forbidden. Do you know where Dr. Siebert is? I haven't seen her today. She said she'd come. Maybe, she'll still show up. Members of the party... who stuck out for total abolition of the act... risked being expelled from the Socialist Earty. Thus, the S. E. split the movement... and helped to further fascism. After that, abortions were even more stringently.. punished, and the Nazis even passed... the death penalty, like in other fascist countries. I'm looking for Dr. Siebert. Siebert? -She's at the Women's Center. -No. In recent years there has arisen another movement... for abortion rights. It has become so strong that... the S.E.D. have been forced... to put forward reforms. Limited abortion, with doctors' rights to refuse. We cannot accept this proposal, however, because it means a continuation of tutelage... for women and the nation in general. I'm looking for Dr. Siebert, a gynecologist. She's at the hospital. She's on night duty. Now the search for a hospital started. Most of them said on the phone... they just refused to do abortions, or they said there weren't enough beds. However, many hospitals asked me to come... for examination, because they made money that way. The doctors told me... they did abortions in exceptional cases, but mine wasn't one of them. They said I was just the right age... to bring up a child, and... I could keep my job, and that was a way... of proving just how emancipated I was. In one public hospital they did accept me, said I could come the very next day. I had to wait for hours, and then they told me... my bed had been given to a woman in her 4th month. I was examined as a matter of course. The diagnosis showed I was four months pregnant. I had to scrape money together, so as to get... to Amsterdam as quickly as possible. In the meantime, it was hopeless... trying to find a hospital here... to take me in. In Amsterdam they confirmed... I was only three months pregnant. We work on shifts alongside the men like them, we leave the factory gates But there our work does not end We are women and we fight Fearlessly for the revolution With all our comrades for Communism United in struggle we are strong I saw a gynecologist yesterday... and he confirmed that I am pregnant. He thought it quite in order to have the child, but I'm finding it very hard to make up my mind. Have you had a pregnancytest? And it was positive? When was the first day of your last period? August 1 1th. About 8 weeks, then? Why didn't you come before? I wanted to see a woman who... I think I have more confidence in a woman... on the question... of how to cope alone. I'd like to talk personally, not listen... to preaching that... it's normal for me to have a baby. Would you like to have it? I was looking forward to it, but not having firm.. ties with the man makes it difficult. My boyfriend requires harmony and happiness, and he doesn't realize he can't... achieve that on his own, so he's trying... to keep up a dual relationship... in which all we do... is get on each other's nerves. He can't see where his trouble lies, namely in his mother complex, which is very strong in him. They had lots of kids at home, and he's always... felt he was neglected from his earliest days. We have opposite ideas of responsibility. We would like a baby... just for the fun of it. And I could see trouble Iooming, professionally, and in all sorts of ways. What is your profession? I'm an actress. How old are you? Thirty. Got any children? I took the pill for 7 years, then got scared... I'd never be able to have a baby. It was always important for me to think... I could have one sometime. What's the situation in Berlin... if I want an abortion now? There's Iegal abortion, but then... you have to show reason why. Usually they write: danger of suicide, because that gets past the experts best. It's tricky, of course. She has to prove she's ill. A woman has to more or Iess call herself... mentally ill to achieve an abortion, and you never know where the file will end up. Then the doctor's panel names two experts, who have to give their consent. But you still have to find a hospital. Then we have to see when it can be done. Both the doctors and the hospital authorities have... a right to refuse. What's the method? How is it done? It's still done with the traditional... scraping method. But there's another way... The suction method? They don't do it in Berlin. I saw it in a film once, it was quite simple. Eainless, and the woman could get up at once. We shouldn't treat that too Lightly, either, but it's Iess of a stress than curettage, and total anesthesia isn't needed. It can even be done in the outpatient department. Why haven't they introduced it here yet? The doctors haven't Iearnt how. This makes it tough for me. What does your friend do? He acts, too. So very difficult... He finds it so hard to express what he wants. And if I were to have a baby now, I'd have to see to everything myself, seeing... what kindergartens there are... whether I could go on working with a baby, what to do if the baby's sick, who'd look after it. It's all quite difficult. But you'd still very much like a child? You probably see that as a positive factor... Yes, I think it's extremely important. What is it? I want to be with you. I need you. Why are you up at this hour? What do you want with me? I've been thinking of you all the time. Leave me alone. You don't need me. All you need me for is screwing. It sickens me. You're so considerate. leave me alone! Why did you run away? I can't stand it. I can't stand it all alone. I can't stand it with you or anyone. You don't really try. Course I do! All the time. I tried it with you, too. You're ruining me. I don't want anything from you. You're too strong for me. All women are too strong for me. Leave me alone. I can't explain. It's as if I had a stone here, something with veins, blue and red veins, and I'd like to pass through, but I can't. When I was seventeen or eighteen I thought... maybe a woman could help me burst... the thing, like with a Iaser gun, till it all melts away. But it only got harder. You make me more and more aware of the thing, you see? I can't react to you the way I want. I'd like to react more sensibly, clearer, stronger, I'd like it to be some other way, but I can't, I can't. I might as well hang myself. Why do you always think about yourself? I keep thinking I don't want to hurt you, and then I run away. I need your tenderness. I can't show any, not even to you. -I've never Iearnt how. -Yes, you have. I was brought up by Nazis, I'm a fascist. I have no tenderness at all. I have visions of beating you to a pulp. Stop that! Oh, fuck off! I don't believe you. You can kiss my ass. Come to me! Beat it! That's my bed. You old bag! A guy can't even sleep in his own bed. I don't know what it is. I only wish I could, and things go all right, but then I can't. You're too much for me, you see, like a saint, like the Virgin Mary. That's okay, of course, it's not a matter of that. That's something different, something in your belly. As soon as I fall in love, it makes me smaller and smaller. I can't make it. BIoody stupid. Better make love to the dog rather than you. What happens now? I'm Ieaving. You? I'm clearing out. That's no solution. Or maybe I'll string myself up. UNDER THE EAVEMENT LIES THE STRAND Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
