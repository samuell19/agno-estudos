Where's the woman? Ah... What the devil? Who put here in there? She's yours, Captain... you've got her. Bitch! Detail. Forward, ho! Look at her, settin' in there. Two years captive with them red bucks. Don't it make you wonder though? What? How many of 'em got to her. Don't it get you all worked up? - Wade. Sometimes you talk like a pervert. - Me? It's not her fault the Cheyenne grabbed her. Well, I'm not sayin' it is, but... by guff. I'd sure like to get my hands on some of that. You can keep your hands to yourself when we get to Fort Reunion. - Why? - He's waiting for her there. - Who? - Her financée. Spingarn! Spingarn! We need flankers. Sir? You ought to put out some flankers. Are you advising me, Captain? Me? Huh? I'm only the Pay Master. You get no 'advice' from me soldier. I'm telling you... put out some flankers. What're you afraid of, sir? Road agents? Cheyenne! Excuse me Cap'n, but I ain't heard yet about no Injuns comin' after a Pay Master's detail. - They got no use for that money chest. - Flankers! Yes, sir. Get. All right. I guess we're out far enough. Why pick on us? Why not? Just getting up real close... you can almost see her... you could take your hand... and you could put it right around... one of her pretty little ankles. You could Honus... an' you're a snot nose. You're a good friend... the best friend I ever had... but you're snot nosed and you always will be. Willie! Take cover! Take cover! Spingarn... you stupid son of a bitch. Dismount! Take cover and fire at will. Oh, my God. Lieutenant... the woman... the woman! Get up. Stupid... cocking... murdering bastards. Imbecile... the murderer. Fire you... now I advise you to try to control yourself. Oh my God... we're lost. We can treat with them. - What? - White flag! Talk to them... we can make'em listen! Captain, those bloody butchers want nothing more than our hides. I'm gonna talk to them. I'm gonna talk to them. - Captain... Come back here! - You, Indians. No Kill! No kill! Fire! Fire! Woods are on fire. Fire! Won't take'em long now. Hey! Hey, up here. Come on! Come on! Well, don't just stand there. Get your ass up here! Gee. You it! What? - You all that's coming? - I don't know. Well, follow me! Wait! Hey! Get down... come on. Well, there goes the wagon. They'll be looking for us. Nah. Not for long. Not him! Not who? Spotted Wolf! In case you didn't know what hit you, they're Cheyenne. How can you tell it's Spotted Wolf? I saw him. You know him by sight? I know him. What's your name? Honus Gent. Cresta Maribel Lee. - Are you wounded there? - What? - Are you wounded? - Oh? No... that's not my blood. Good 'cause we've got a long wait. They are gonna be messin' with those bodies down there for hours. - Ah... what do you doing? - I'm takin' off my pants. - Why? - 'Cause it's hotter than hell an'they're ichin'. Oh. Ahh. We'd better take it easy. Get comfortable. I sure as hell wish I hadn't lost my hat. Ah... Miss? Huh? About Spotted Wolf? How do you? Ah... I'm his wife. Oh. Hey, look here. Come on. Hey, what're you doing there? Nothing. Look, I don't want to rush you soldier, but it's going to be dark in a couple of hours... and we can't hang around here. You're... you're robbing the dead. My God. You're robbing the dead! Yep! Well, I sure as hell ain't getting much. A little hard tack mostly, but that'll keep us... going for a while. You find anything better? My God. - It was you. - Me? - He was looking for you! - What the hell are you talking about? Spotted Wolf. He was out to bring you back. - Bull shit! - The Cheyennes would... - What? - You heard me. I've nothing to do with it. The Cheyennes would never attack a Pay Master's detail. Bull shit! - He was looking for you! - Ah, he wouldn't trouble himself. Don't flatter me, Soldier Blue. I'm not worth any chest of gold. They've got no use for gold. Well, what the hell do you think they were fighting with? Rifles cost money, see... and if you don't believe me... then try and find the pay chest... go ahead... find it! Any more questions? - I want to say something. - Yeah? Well hang on to it, we're leaving. For them! Huh? Something must be said for them. You mean a kind of service, huh? Ah, what the hell... go ahead. - Should be a prayer. - Right! A prayer. I bet you know a hundred prayers. I should be here. Huh? I should be here, lying with them, with my company. Why? I mean, you've come out pretty good it seems to me. See. They're all lying here dead, and you're still walking. - Murdering savages. - Yeah, you go right ahead. You can howl at the moon if you want to, but it's not going to get us back to Fort Reunion. Now, you say your something, or let's get the hell out of here. Theirs not to make reply. Theirs not to reason why. Theirs but to do and die. Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred. Storm'd at with shot and shell. Boldly they rode and well. Into the jaws of... of Death. Into the mouth of Hell. Rode the six hundred. Flash'd all their sabres bare. Flash'd as they turn'd in air. Charging an army, while all the world wonder'd: Theirs not to reason why. Theirs but to do and die: Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred. Jesus. Throw them out. What? Your socks. Why you bother? Here. What's the matter? - It's mud! - It's a little dirty. - Where's the canteen? - Oh, no. You're not gonna' touch something that was robbed from the dead, are you? All right. - We might be needing them later. - That's using your head Soldier Blue. Would you like some more mud? Isn't it. Can't you do something with that dress? - Huh? - Can't you... pull it together some way? Couple of days, I'll lose a few pounds. I won't be showin' through so much. - Uh... it never did fit me anyway... one of hers. - Whose? That woman at the Snake Flats agency. Right off, she stripped me down naked. Stuck me in a tub, and gave me this here dress. Hey! Hey, did you see the hat? Big bright yellow hat she gave me. Covered my whole face. I did love that hat, though. I'm sick at heart about losin' that. - Sick at heart. - You can say that now! What's the matter? What'd I say? 21 men lying dead back there and you sit here mourning a yellow hat. - 21 men! - A drop in the old bucket. - A what? - It's not the army, Soldier Blue. They're not the ones getting killed off... in this damn fool country. - Our country, Miss Lee, is neither damned or foolish. Balls! - Mrs. Lee, you have a most profane way of speaking. - You should hear me in Cheyenne. Do you want to? No! Good brave lads comin' out here to kill themselves a real live Injun. Puttin'up their forts in a country they've got no claim to. So what the hell do you expect the Indians to do? Sit back on their butts... while the army take's over their land - You saw for yourself what they did, taking off scalps. Yeah, and who taught them that little trick? The white man! And cutting off hands and cutting off feet and cutting off... I know what they cut off, but at least they don't make tobacco pouches out of them... uhah. - That's something else you soldier boy's made up. - You're lying. You ever seen an Indian camp after the army's been there? Huh? You ever see the women and what was done to them before they where killed? Ever see the little boys and girls stuck on the long knifes? Huh? Stuck and dying? WelI, I have. Fine. Go to sleep. You're lying. ♪ My true love sleeps o'er the hillside. Hey, ho, tiddle-um-dey. ♪ ♪ My true love sleeps o'er the hillside.

Put me in an orphanage on Canal Street. Eh... what the hell. Whoever asked to get themselves born anyway... huh? Who? - I'm going a sleep. - You do that soldier.

Maybe, uh... four days at the most. There we are, right out there in the open. And there they come. A-whooping it, out of nowhere. They'll have us hanging feet high, and let the crows pluck out our eyes. You may not be aware, Miss Cresta Lee... but I'm a professional soldier, and I happen to be well experienced in this part of the country How long have they kept you private, Private. No one's kept me, Miss Lee. It was my father's wish. You take that road, Soldier Blue, and you'll get your father coming out here to bury you. My father's dead. He was killed at Little Big Horn, last year. Murdered by the Sioux. I wonder if that General Custer took your father's advice. Well, it's a sure thing I ain't takin' yours. Listen, you keep the rifle. The jerky you can have, just give me some of this hard tack. There, there we are. Good luck, Soldier Blue, I'll tell them at the Fort it wasn't my fault. Hey, Private Gent! Miss Lee! - Well. Get lost? - Couldn't do it! - Huh? - Leaving you all alone. I couldn't forgive myself if something happened to you. Well... thank you! Heh! What could I say to your financée. Oh! You know about him, huh? How could I face him? How could I look him in the eye? Yeh, I see. A soldier's duty for another soldier, and to hell with me. A matter of principle, Miss Lee. It's a matter of crap. Have some berries. Berries make me sick. - Well, Christ. - Naah! Look at that, another rip. God dammit. - Do you talk in front of him that way? - Who? Your fiancée? Huh! That's a funny thing, you know. We don't talk. I can't remember one conversation we ever had. He'd just grab hold... and I'd hold off, and... Thank goodness I held off long enough. So he, uh, joined the army. Boy, that did it... Six long months at Fort Reunion, and no women. I was sent for, to come out and have a military wedding. Here I am, still trying to get there. - You sure he's still waiting? - He said so in the telegraph. The way you put it, well. Uh... A person gets the idea you're marrying him for money. Yeah, I am! Lose something? My sock. - It's gone! - I'll tell you soldier... it's gonna cut your washing in half. - I'm going back a way. - You're not! - It won't take but a moment. Look, I promise I won't report you for being out of uniform. Jesus Christ. A hundred miles ahead of us, and you're going back... back! What the hell am I doing. Twenty-one soldiers, and I get you! Don't touch it. Don't you lay a finger on that rifle! You hear me? It's hidden there under the jacket. You just let it stay like that. - Cheyenne? - Kiowa! - Oh! - And they want to kill us, but not too quick. - Where'd they come from. - From one lousy sock. - Well, we've got to do something. - You can watch. What're you talking about? They're going to rape me Soldier Blue. and then they're gonna kill us afterwards. Oh, my God! - Did I see you? - I spit. - Well, how could you? - Ssshhh. - What;s going on? - I insulted them. Oh, no! I told them they were five old women. I said that they were afraid of you. That you were tall and strong and feared nothing. You. Wait... don't pick it up... take off your clothes. Not me! Look at him, Soldier Blue. He can move twice as fast as you can... in those stupid army pants. Take'em off! I can't fight in my long johns. Take them of, too! He can hold you with them. Look, it's my life as well as yours. You want to kill us both? Take them off! - I can't! - Take'em off! - No! - You bastard! Shut up! Kill him! You've won. They expect you to kill him. Hey Honus! You did it! You did it! Honus! Hey, Honus. Wait for me! Honus! - Honus. - Wait up! Wha... what're you doing? I'm freezing my ass off. You... you can't sleep here. Why not? Well. I'm here. Turn over and close your eyes, we'll be warm in no time. Honus what're you doing? I can't! You can't what? I can't do it. What do you want to do, Honus? Oh man. Take it! You take it. I want the rifle Honus. What for? It's a goat.. What? Honest to God, it is a real live goat. Now don't argue with me... give me the rifle I want to see for myself. Oh, no... Honus! - Give me that rifle. - Sshh, you'll scare him. He can hear is and you're gonna miss him by three hills. - I'll get him. - You'll miss him. I'll get him. He's gone. Look, you dumb gun soldier. He's gone. You stupid, beardless, tenderfoot! I hope you choke on berries. Do you hear me? I hope you throw up all night. Miss Lee. Cresta. - Brain shot. Dead on. - Oh, oh Honus. It's beautiful. Oh, Honus. I've got to tell you the truth, Honus. He was a tough old bastard. - Please, I've asked you not to. - All right, all right, I'm sorry. - It's not that I'm a prude or anything. - Oh, I know you're not, Honus. I've really gotta be more careful. Well, I guess it's time we turned in. Honus. It's stupid. You over there, and me over here. Honus? All right, I guess you're right. Honus. Will you be all right. I mean. - I know what you mean. - Will you? I'll make it. Somehow. Listen, I'll try not to move much. - That'll help. - I will. Smells like rain. Well, there isn't a cloud in the sky. 'Night, Honus. Good night, Miss Lee. Shut up! It's a white man's fire. How do you know? It's different from a red man's fire. Oh. Gosh Almighty! I hope you'll forgive the intrusion, sir. I'm Private Honus Gent, of the Calorado 11th Cavalry. Lord, declare. And... uh. This young lady is Miss Cresta Lee, from New York City. - So 'tis, so 'tis. - We're trying to get to Fort Reunion. You see, uh. My troop was wiped out by the Cheyenne. - Devils. Devils. - It was a Pay Master's escort. And Miss Lee had joined us to meet her fiancée. Good... hah... good for you. Yeah. Where is your guns? - Guns? - Guns. You're the hunting type? Oh no. Uh... we lost our rifle in the flood. Hey! That was a ripple, wasn't it? Come near drownin' my two beauties, there. They been 16 years with Isaac Cumber. Huh. Heh. I'm pleased to meet you Mr. Cumber. Isaac Q... the Q part was my daddy's joke... being as he calls me Cumber....sayin' Q Cumber... but I kinda like it. Oh. That's a. quite a wagon. You... travel in style Yeh, I do, ah, I surely do. I got grub and tools and blankets and, ah, bolts of calico. - Just in case. - In case of Indians, huh? Take a look. Take a look in these eyes, Soldier. That's honesty you see there. Hard rock honesty! I treats 'em fair, and I treats 'em square. And they don't fool none with Isaac Q! - What about hostiles? - Hostiles! 'Ya think I trade with hostiles? Devils. Devils. Hey, you look kinda' peek'd, Missy. You don't talk much, huh? Well, that's alright. A man would rather look at a woman than... talk to her, any day, and you... uh. I can see more of you right now... than I seen of my wife in 27 years. God rest her soul. Her frosty-faced soul. - We could use some food, Mr. Cumber. - Yea, you could, you surely could. I'm... ah. I'm partial to rabbit, myself. That'd be fine. If you don't mind, I could use some of your calico. Help yourself. In back of the wagon. - Are we met? - What? - I get the feeling we met. - No, I don't think so. In my rucksack, help yourself, good lye soap. you can, uh, scrub each other off, or, uh. Whatever else you have a mind to. Are you sure you haven't met him before? - I'm sure! - Think about it. Why? - Because there's something wrong. - What? I don't know. The man's a Devil, right? - He's a pots trader, right? - Yeah, is something wrong? Pots traders don't go out looking for gold. - And especially not in Indian country. - So he wants to get rich quick. - Who doesn't? - Well, uh, I still think. Oh no! Please, don't think! Not now! - We have got food and a nice warm fire. - What if he... uh. Wait a minute. How do we know you didn't meet through Spotted Wolf's camp? - He doesn't trade with hostile Devils. - That could be it. - What could be it? - Trading with the Cheyenne. - Bolts of cloth? I mean guns. Rifles. Well, there's the wagon. Go... look for'em. Ah... eh! - 'Ya like it? - It's different. Boy Honus, you sure know how to flatter a girl. 'Must be a born gift. They must be hidden somewhere else! - You know the type tal. - Here. - What? - Take a bath. Listen to me. That old man is trading off rifles for the pay cheques we had. Honus, if I'm gonna look different, you might as well smell different. Now take the soap. Maybe it's got a false bottom. - I'm going to take a look. - No! Right now, before he get's back. - No! - Oh, get out of my way. Honus, you've got no right. Get down! Get off me! Stop it! You've known it all along. The rifles are inside... and you have met him before. Twice... selling guns! Yes. - To the Cheyenne. - Yes! To kill American soldiers. And you wouldn't stop him? I couldn't then. I wouldn't now! What? For your own people? Most people I know live in New York City. - For your country then. - Whose country then? This isn't my country... we're in Indian country. OK. Why? Tell me, why did you ever leave the Cheyenne? All right. You really want know? Because they tallk different... they dress different... .and they eat different. Because I am not a Cheyenne, Solider Blue, and I never will be. But I can tell you right now that I'd rather be one... than any rump butt soldier... of any blood thirsty army you can name! You're a traitor, Miss Lee. Well... at least that's settled! Cresta? Got a good look, did you? I thought you would. Where is she? Clunkered! Got her with my rifle butt. Over there, by the fire.

You and me... we're here Honus. Don't you see? The two of us, right here. That's all. We can't be any place else. When we go back, it's not ''we'' anymore. Excuse me. Sir, I'm sorry to break in on you like this. My name's Cresta Maribel Lee. Cresta! Johnny? Cresta! I could'ave swore. Cresta, I can't. I just can't believe it. My God!

I'm sorry, it can't be done. - He'll last two weeks if he's lucky. - Yes, well perhaps by that time... I may be able to send some help. Well, that's mighty big of you buster. Cresta!. Give me a horse and supplies... I'll go myself. Miss Lee, this is wild country. I'm sorry; I can't allow you to go out there by yourself. Well, how the hell do you think I got here? Cresta! Excuse me sir, but do you think I could have a few moments alone with Miss Lee? I think you should, McNair. I suggest a long and sober talk. - Yes... Well, thank you, sir... if you'll excuse me, sir. - Indeed! - You know, Mitchel. - Yes, sir? When I see young people, today, behaving like that, I just... I can't help wondering what this God-damned country is coming to? When we get home we're going to be married, aren't we? What's so terrible about wanting to... - Get together with my bro. - Well, nothing, but, I mean, don't we even... get to say "hello" first? - Oh, for Christ's sake! - You got no reason to swear. - Swear? - Me, swear? - You can send someone after Honus. - We can't. Not for a while. - Why not? Cheyenne... And you, more than anyone. Ought to appreciate that. - You'll never find'em. - Oh, we already have. - We know exactly where they are. - Where? Oh just... just a little west of here. Up by the twin rock pass, the Jewels Pass. - Are you sure of that? - Of course. We should be inside of their campground by tomorrow. You know. There's only one thing wrong with me, Johnny. It's been so long... so very long. - Oh, yeah! - But now we're together. Yes! Well... it's just that... I haven't had anything to eat in two days, and I'm just so hungry. - I don't know what I'm saying. - Hungry? If we could just have... a little something... out on the tall grass, there. Oh, yeah... of course. I'll... I'll be right back. Excuse me, miss?. What are you doing? Ah... shit! It's all right. He's my fiancée. By. Uh! Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy. Whoa. - Cresta. - Wantehemo.

If you'd let me talk to her for just a few minutes she might convince Spotted Wolf to give up without a fight. Without a fight? We destroyed the rifles they were counting on, so they can't possibly win. - There's just no sense to it. - Private Gent! I don't know what sort of relationship you and this woman have had. But I can assure you that my men are prepared to move... against the enemy at daybreak. - And move they will. - Sir! Twenty-one of your own comerades murdered. Cut to pieces. - I know, sir. - The price will be paid, soldier. - Is it worth it? - Dismissed! Yes, sir. Prepare to fire. There just seems to be normal activity over there, sir. The cannon will commence firing at 7:30. Six rounds apiece until we find the range. And I know, McNair, I know she's in there someplace. No matter what we might think of her she's still a white woman. That can't be helped. No, sir. Can I depend on you? I will do my duty, sir.. Good. Good. All right, Lieutenant. Give the order. - They're coming out, sir! - What? What's that? - I think it's Spotted Wolf! - My God, sir. He's got a flag of truce. - Yes, sir. It's a white flag. - Nonsense! - Will you see for yourself. - I told you Lieutenant. Give the order! Sir? Well, give the order! Yes, sir. Open fire! Ready. Cover ears. Fire! All pieces, increase elevation one degree. Fire when ready. They've the range now. Stop! Stop! Gent! Stay away from that cannon! No! Arrest him! Stop! Arrest that man! No! No. There's a white woman in that. Colonel look. They're attacking. Bugeler, sound Alert. Soldiers! After those bastards! Main troops. Form covering party. Brace for incoming. Company ride. Forward! Form three ranks. Charge! Line up the front. Troops. Rally to your Guidons. McNair, form these troops in two columns on the left and right. Advance at full gallop attacking the village on both flanks. You take the left, I'll take the right. Artillery pieces, cease firing. We'll attack... right of the village. Troops, at the front. March! Troops, by the front. March. Halt! Charge! Are you OK, Colonel? I'm all right. McNair. Raze the village! Burn this... pestilence! Keewa! Keewa! Keewa! Keewa! Keewa! Cresta! Cresta! Cresta! Hold his legs. Please, please... please Please. Please. Please. Yahooo! Get that white woman out of there. I'll put one poor devil out of its misery. Damn you! What are you doing? - Why? Why? Why? - Shut up, Honus! He's gone mad. Cresta. Got a prayer, Soldier Blue? A nice poem? Say something pretty. And to each of you. To officer and soldier alike. I offer my most profound admiration... my deepest affection... and my overwhelming gratitude... for a job well done. You men here today... have succeeded... at making another part of America... a decent place for people to live. We have given the Injun... a lesson he will not soon forget. But more than that... for the rest of your lives. You men will hold your heads proud... when this day is mentioned... and you will say "Yes!" I was with Iverson! The Eleventh Colorado Volunteers. Move out! Cresta. On November 29th, 1864... a unit of Colorado cavalry, numbering over 700 men... attacked a peaceful Cheyenne village at Sand Creek, Colorado. The Indians raised the American Flag and a white flag of surrender. Nevertheless the cavalry attacked. massacring 500 Indians... more than half of whom were women and children. Over one hundred scalps were taken... bodies dismembered... plus numerous reports of rape. General Nelson A. Miles... Army Chief of Staff... termed the massacre... perhaps the foulest and most unjust crime... in the annals of America.
