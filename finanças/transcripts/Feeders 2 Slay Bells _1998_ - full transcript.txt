(mysterious instrumental music) (eerie tense music) (loud whooshing) - Look, this is not a story that I'm making up. We were out there, we saw these... (clacking) They were all over the place. And we ran, and we ran, and we finally found this place to hide. It was horrible. I killed my best friend. I killed him. I thought... I thought he was one of them. But it was him. It was the aliens. The aliens made me kill him. It's an invasion, I'm telling you, I've told you once, no one will listen to me. It's an invasion. And they're all over the place. They're here now. (drowned out speaking) There's gonna be more of them, and we've gotta find them. We've got to, it's the only thing we can do. Please, won't you listen to me? My friend is dead, I've seen a lot of people killed. These things, these things are horrible. They're aliens from another planet. They are here to overtake our planet, they're here to colonize, to feed off of us, to eat us, they are here on our planet, and we've gotta do something about them! (dark ambient music) I don't know what else to tell you, I don't know what else to say. They're here from another world. They're here from another world, they're here to kil us, they're here to take over our world. We saw them. Me and my friends saw them. We tried our best to get away, and it did not work. Nothing we did worked. (lighthearted Christmas music) - Thank you. - You two sure are good little helpers. - We're Santa's helpers! - Mommy, when is Santa coming? - Oh, in about one more day. - Is he bringing lots of toys for us? - Only if Daddy gets paid tomorrow. - What, Daddy? - Oh, nothing honey. You know what? - [Little Kid] What, what? - I think this is gonna be the best Christmas yet. (intense synth music) (guttural growls) (beeping) (low grumbling) (calming Christmas music) (clock ticking) (strange ambient music) What the hell? (guttural growls) Is that an airplane? (dog whimpering) (strange ambient music) That was weird. (guttural growls) Time to get up for work anyway. (guttural growls) (dog barking) (water running) (dark ambient music) (guttural growls) (yawning) (hair dryer blowing) Damn. That fuse box must be on the brink again. (dark ambient music) (guttural growls) - Oh, Lady. You must be sore, doggy. You shouldn't have run out into the road. No. Alan, are you leaving work early? - I'll try, but don't hold your breath. - But today is Christmas Eve. - Tell that to my boss, he doesn't care. It's just another day to him. What's on your agenda? - Wrapping gifts, and wrapping gifts, and wrapping gifts. - Sounds like fun, I'll call you later. - Hey, what's Santa bringing me for Christmas? - Well, what do you get a woman who has everything? - More. (dog whimpering) - Bye, Daddy! - Bye Daddy! - See you later. Bye bye. Santa's coming tonight. - Good! - Good! - See you later. - See ya. - You guys be good. - Okay. - I'll see you when I get home from work. See you later. (lighthearted violin music) (strange ambient music) - Gimme, gimme, gimme. (car honking) - Maybe Santa will bring me some sanity for Christmas. (loud fart) (cheery Christmas music) - I just love the holidays. (guttural growls) (guttural growls) (calming instrumental music) (guttural growls) (guttural growls) - Bernice! Hi, you're home! I've been calling people all day long, and I just can't seem to get anybody. Has everybody gone on vacation? (laughing) No, oh that sounds wonderful. (loud beeping) (cat meowing) (guttural growls) (cat meowing) - Oh, really, oh, wait a minute, wait. Fluffy? Oh, my cat's doing something. Let me go find out what's wrong with Fluffy and then I'll call you back, okay? Okay, bye. Fluffy? Fluffy. Fluffy, where are you? Where's my Fluffernutter, my bad boy. (dark ambient music) Fluffy? Fluffy? Fluffy? Fluffy. Are you in the basement? You're not supposed to be in the basement, Fluffy. (dark ambient music) Fluffy, where's my Fluffycat? Fluffy? Fluffy! Come on. Fluffy? Fluffy. Fluffy! Oh, Fluffy, ah! (guttural growls) (loud screaming) (phone ringing) (loud squishing) - Hm, she must be shopping. (clock ticking) - I don't see Santa. - You gotta look in the sky! - I don't see Santa! (dark ambient music) What's that? - I think it's an elf. (high pitched laughing) - I don't want elf, I want Santa. (dark ambient music) (lighthearted instrumental music) (strange ambient music) (guttural growls) - What is this? (mysterious instrumental music) (lighthearted Christmas music) - Hey kids, how bout a cartoon? (loud typing) (mysterious instrumental music) - Hundreds of thousands of people every year claim to see UFOs or see beams from another planet. U.S. government flatly denies the existence of aliens, friendly, or otherwise. - Parker! What do aliens have to do with insurance claims anyway? - Uh, nothing sir. - That's right, you stupid son of a bitch! Get back to work, or spend the new year on the unemployment line! - Yes, Mr. Hatton. Merry Christmas. - I hate Christmas! And you're not leaving early either! - No problem. I better get back to work. - You asshole, you better! - Scrooge. (Christmas instrumental music) - [TV Santa] Quick, quick, we're just in a hurry. Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen. (dramatic instrumental music) Hi-ho! We keep our direction, we'll have to fly low. (lighthearted instrumental music) (triumphant instrumental music) (guttural growls) (strange ambient music) (guttural growls) (dog whimpering) (guttural growls) (dog barking) - Bad doggy, you're gonna get in trouble, come here. Let's go. (high pitched laughing) (relaxing instrumental music) (glass breaking) (guttural growls) (mysterious instrumental music) (guttural growls) (water dropping) (guttural growls) (screaming) (loud squishing) (lighthearted Christmas music) - God, I thought that day would never end. (guttural growls) Bills... Bills, bills. Merry Christmas. (calming instrumental music) What are you guys doing? - I'm making my toy list for Santa. - Are you excited? - Yes, Daddy. Are you? - Well, Christmas is for kids. - When's Santa gonna get here? - Tonight. So you'll have to go to bed early. Where's Mommy? - Upstairs wrapping our presents. - Santa brings your presents. - Right. (calming instrumental music) - [Bernice] Hi hun, I'm finally finished. - Is that everything? - Yeah, there's some more gifts in the basement, but I'll get them later. Why are you so tired? - Something woke me up last night. Something strange. - Well, what was it? - Bright lights. In the sky. - Maybe you were dreaming. - No, no. It was too surreal to be a dream, but too unreal to be believable. - I think you've been drinking too much egg nog. (strange ambient music) (guttural growls) - What the hell? Who's gonna miss a couple hundred bucks? (mysterious ambient music) (guttural growls) (guttural growls) (loud yelling) (guttural growls) (loud yelling) (guttural growls) - Dad, I'm ready for Santa. - Well, he won't go hungry, that's for sure. - Does Santa get milk and cookies wherever he goes? - Yup. That's why he's so fat. But it's time for bed, let's go. (excited laughing) Come on, come on. (lighthearted Christmas music) (dark ambient music) (guttural growls) Need some help? - Yeah, you could help me with that package. (guttural growls) - What's this? - That is one ugly doll. - It must belong to one of the kids. (loud fart) (dog whimpering and barking) - Lady, get back here. - Let her go. She can spend the night in the basement. (dog whimpering) (guttural growls) (loud squishing) (lighthearted Christmas music) - Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho! (guttural growls) (loud beeping) (high pitched laughing) (lighthearted Christmas music) - Merry Christmas, dear. - Ho, ho, ho, I hope the kids like their presents. - They should. It was practically the whole toy store. (guttural growls) - Do you believe in Santa? - I don't know. I used to when I was a kid, but I stopped believing a long time ago. (snoring) You know, that looks like a good idea. - Good, I can give you your Christmas present now. - Feets, don't fail me now! (laughing) (guttural growls) (loud screaming) - The only way to fight them, the only way to fight them is for us to band together, for us to band together... I'm sorry, we gotta stop this interview. I am not lying. I am not out of my mind. This is not a fantasy. This is not a fantasy, this is reality. They are here, more are coming, they are going to take over our world and kill us all! And unless we do something about it, unless we band together, unless we fight them, there is not going to be any future for mankind. I must've told this 20 times, I guess I'll have to tell it 20 more. All we were going to do is go to the ocean. It was a long drive, we weren't expecting anything. Just trying to get away from it all, you know? Just trying to see some new stuff, new places, new people. But, of course things didn't work out that way. Everything was fine until we hit Pennsylvania. It's a beautiful state. We had no idea what we were about to face, we had no idea what we were about to find. Out of nowhere, this guy appeared on the road, and we hit him. He just staggered out, he just staggered out in front of the car. Before we knew it, he was under the wheel. We dragged him out, we tried to help him, we tried to see if we could do something, but he was, I don't know, he was... Unconscious and later babbling about little men, we had no idea what he was talking about. We brought him to a doctor. We thought everything was gonna be okay. We had no idea that he was dead. We left him there. We had no idea what to expect. The doctor was gonna take care of everything. Once we left the office, we just sort of thought that was that. We headed out to the park, decided to spend the night there, do some camping. Wait and see what was gonna happen. We were supposed to meet some girls there too, girls that never showed up. Well... At least not alive, anyway. While we were settling down, getting ready to eat, that's when we first saw them, the space ships. The first one, anyway. They flew over our campsite, hovering like a evil bird of prey. Then we saw one of them. It was the first time we ever saw them. They were little. But they were ferocious. They attacked us. We fought back as best we could, and everything seemed to be okay for the moment. We ran, we ran, and get the hell of out of there. We just got out and looked for help, tried to find someone to tell, someone to talk to, to believe us. We didn't find anybody. We ran, and we ran, and we ran. We finally found a house in the middle of nowhere. We thought everything was fine, we thought everything was gonna be okay. But when we approached the house, we had a feeling that something was wrong. There was a car outside, there was a body in the car. It looked like whoever it was, it tried to get away. They didn't get very far. We decided to go in the house anyway, look around, at least try to find something, a weapon, a phone to use. All the electricity inside had been cut. We explored the house, checked out the downstairs, decided to check out the upstairs. I went up, not expecting really to find anything, scared to find anything. We were alone, we were totally alone. Everyone in the house had been killed, butchered, and partially eaten. We had no weapons. The car outside was useless. We tried to make plans, decide what to do, then another of their ships appeared, right over the house. It started to land outside, the light was blinding. We watched it, quietly, wondering what was gonna happen. Something, a light, a beam, some sort of power source erupted from the ship. Hit the house. We fell, or were knocked unconscious, I don't know. I finally came to, my friend was gone. I didn't know what had happened. I remember getting up, I heard something at the door. It was him. He came back, he said that they'd gotten him, they had taken him aboard their ship, they had performed scientific experiments on him, he was pretty bad shape. Then I saw another of him at the front door. I was amazed, I was astounded, I had no idea what I was seeing. It turned out, they must've made a duplicate of him, they must've made a clone of him. I thought I had killed the alien, I thought I had killed the duplicate, it didn't turn out that way. I ended up killing my friend. They were here to conquer the earth, they were here to use us as food. (dark ambient music) (clock ticking) (guttural growls) (lighthearted Christmas music) (guttural growls) (strange ambient music) - I'll get you, you Christmas saboteurs! - I'm looking for Santa. - Is he here yet? - Not yet. (guttural growls) There's Santa! - What's wrong with him? (guttural growls) - Let's tell Daddy. - What is it, kids? - [Daughter] Santa fell down outside. - Look, you guys gotta get to sleep, or Santa's not gonna come at all. (guttural growls) What the hell was that? Kids, get up here on the bed. I'm gonna check it out. (guttural growls) (loud screaming) - What are they? - Elves! - They're not elves, they're monsters, or creatures or something. - Are you okay? - I think I'm okay, yeah. - I'll call for help. - You should come see this, there's a funny looking plane outside. - What was that? - We got disconnected! (intense instrumental music) - They're UFOs. Those are aliens. - Well, they have really poor timing. - Did you really see someone outside? - I did Daddy,, I really did. (guttural growls) - I've gotta go see who's outside. - You can't do that, you're gonna be killed! - We can't let them out there to die. It's Christmas Eve. - Help Santa, Daddy. - Daddy will try. Close the door behind me, I'll be back in a few minutes. - Be careful. (dark ambient music) Get on the bed, let's wait for Daddy. Come on. (clock ticking) (guttural growls) - There is someone out there. (guttural growls) (strange ambient music) Come on, we gotta get you inside. - Someone shot me down! (groaning) (loud beaming) (fast beeping) - Is Daddy gonna be okay? - Yes, Daddy will be fine. - Let's go help Daddy. - We can help Daddy best by staying right here. - Here, let me help you off with that. - Ow, that's real, Alan! - I'm sorry. How did you know my name? - I know everything. I am Santa Clause. - No, no way. There's no such thing as Santa Clause, you're just someone in a Santa suit. - That's why you never get anything for Christmas. Your kids believe in me. - They're kids, they're supposed to. - And adults aren't? - Well look, we got a bigger problem on our hands right now, if you haven't noticed by now. - Those aliens, those pesky aliens! - We gotta get upstairs and hide. - Cower in fear? Never! I've fought blizzards, freezing rain, and hailstorms! Even bratty kids, those aliens don't scare me. - Well, what are we gonna do? - Stand back, I have a little magic up my sleeve. (strange ambient music) - Wait, wait, wait, don't leave me! He really is Santa. (guttural growls) This is the worst Christmas I've ever had! Merry Christmas, bald head! (guttural growls) - Something the elves have been working on for next Christmas. Now let's go kick butt! (guttural growls) (whimsical instrumental music) (loud beaming) - What's that? - I don't know. (loud beaming) (whimsical instrumental music) (high pitched squealing) (dark ambient music) - What about those aliens? What kind of a present is this? - This is a special present. Only the naughtiest people get it. (dark ambient music) (loud beeping) (guttural growls) (high pitched laughing) Well, I better be off. - Is it too late to save Christmas? - Of course not, you moron! I'm Santa Clause. All you have to do is believe. (strange instrumental music) - Mary, Mary wake up. - Not now, I'm trying to sleep. (somber piano music) (clock ticking) - Was it all just a dream? (dog barking) - [Bernice] Here, the last present's yours. - I wonder what it is. - Open it up, silly. Open it up, Alan. (guttural growls) (intense guitar and synth music) (lighthearted Christmas music)
