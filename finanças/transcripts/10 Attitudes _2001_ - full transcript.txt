-Dating in LA is so difficult because first you have to pry open the closet door. And then you have to find the guy who's cowering under his ball gowns and tiaras. And then you have to coax him out of the closet so he'll go some place with you, unless of course he stays in the closet and you stay in there with him. And you have a fine time, but eventually you hate yourself in the morning. It's not an easy bird. MAN (OFFSCREEN): Camera's going. Everybody's set. Get ready. You're into it. OK, having a good time. Yes and action. -Carlos, honey, I'm just totally short. Yeah, I need two more cases of Merlot and six more cases of Perrier. Can you help me out? Oh, fabulous. Great. Thank you so much. Claire, tell him you love him. -I love you. Bye. -Thank you, sweetie. -Uh, Phillipe. -What? -Can you make a fat free quiche? -You must be kidding. A fat free quiche, it's impossible. What about a tofu quiche? I could do a quiche lorraine. I could do a vegetable quiche. I could do spinach quiche. But a fat free quiche, impossible. No, no. Yeah, sure. I got one. There you go. I'll take out the cream. I'll take out the butter. I'll take out the bacon. And I'll serve you the crust. What about that? You all good with that? [GROWLS] -I'm so worried about this Delta Burke thing. -Look, she's a person just like us. And those actresses there-- they never eat anyway. -But it's her Golden Globe party. -You go in my office. You put on your suit. And I'll take care-- -Oh, my god. I forgot my suit. I-- I'll just go home. I'll be back in two seconds. -Hey, what's cooking, good looking? -Oh, hey honey. What are you doing here? -Oh, I just came by to say hi. -Well, come on over here. -All right. -Be nice to him. -Hey. -Hey, honey. -How are you? -Aw. What are you doing here? -I brought you some flowers. -Aw, how sweet. Well, what's this about? -Well, it's congratulations on the party tonight. And I'm sorry that I won't be there. -Why? -Because I have to go to Palm Springs. -What about the Delta Burke thing tonight? -I know. I know. I wanted to be there, but I have to meet Sharon and Ozzy out in Palm Springs. And they're going to be there. We have to go over a bunch of stuff. So this is the only time I can see them. Lyle, you are looking so beige these days. -Thanks. And you're still single, right? -Stop it. Please, please. Or else I'll have to get you a fighting ring. Stop, stop. -Exactly. -All right. Don't forget to get me that headset for my cell phone so I don't get a brain tumor. -Well, that's why I took out that million dollar policy, remember? -Thank you, Sharon Stone. -I know. All right. All right. You have a great party. -Call me from the road. -I will, and I'll see you in a couple days. -Love you. -Yeah. Love you. -Flowers. -Well, maybe those flowers will keep you warm tonight. -I bet you have the best job in the world, don't you? All those big meetings, all those stars. -Yeah, it's good. I mean, you know, I make good money. I like it. -The Gap sucks. Run around all day. Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am. You look wonderful, ma'am. And her little kids are running around lawless, knocking over khakis. And when they leave, who has to fold those khakis? Um, me. -Todd, please. -No, retail sucks. -Well, listen, if you weren't working retail, you would have never met me. Remember when I came in to get those shorts. You gotta look at the brighter side of things. -Well, I guess that's true. -Todd, you're 19 years old, OK? You gotta crawl before you walk, walk before you run. And the next thing you know, you're gonna have some nice things of your own. Just be patient. -I know. I just-- I just feel like I've been crawling for 19 years. You know, sweetie, I've kind of been thinking. Maybe there's a, uh, teeny tiny little corner office, maybe even a booth with my name on it in that big building of yours? Can't you find just a little space for little old me? -Yeah, well, maybe it is time to take those training wheels off of you. But not in my office. -Lyle? -Oh, my-- Hi, honey. Um, I just came by the house. I had to pick up some stuff before I, uh, went off to Palm -Ow! -What the hell is going on here? -Oh, wow. This must be awkward. -Who-- What is this? -Honey, listen. -Who the fuck are you? -Oh, hi. I'm Todd. -Oh, hi, Todd. How are you? I'm Josh. That's my husband you're blowing. -Um, honey, listen. This isn't the way it looks. See, I was giving him a ride. And then we were talking, and then things just started happening and-- -Happening? Just a little happening, huh? A happening is Barbra Streisand in Central Park. This is shit. How could you do this to me? You know, everybody told me about this. Everybody told me. Brandon told me. Claire told me. You are just such a fuck. That's it. [HORN HONKING] -Wow. Is he doing the whole mid-life crisis thing? [TIRES SCREECHING] [CRASH] -My life is over! -I am so busted. -Wait. We're still going to Palm Springs, right? -When he was little, he used to make little tea parties. And he used to have his brother and his sister sit there. He just loved preparing things. He was always in the kitchen with me. Josh was just absolutely the best. And he deserves someone good and not like Kyle. Lyle. He's not for anybody, really. He certainly isn't for my son. My son's too good. I know. Mother talking. What can I say? -Fuck him. That's it. It's over. It's over. [HORN HONKING] Would you just get out of the way? Jesus Christ. Fuck him. Fuck his friend. Fuck his suit. Fuck the lawyer industry. Well, what am I, a crazy person? How could this happen? 10 years, flushed, bullet to death. I am going to get Johnny Cochran, and he's going to get you for every fucking cent that you have. Drive this car up his ass! Let me in! Fucking piece of shit. Oh, fuck that. If Leslie's not home, I'm going to shoot someone. And it'll fucking be Roy. -I can't believe you went with Sage for the caterers. God. I mean, you love everything. You love that chocolate dessert he makes. God. -I think we should, um, start a phase out, you know? -A phase out of what? Eating delicious food? Just because I'm pregnant doesn't mean I can't-- have to give up some of Josh's delicious little Mexican-- I love those things. I think Josh would be great as a godfather. I've been thinking about it. And, you know, he's really wonderful with kids. He really was great to me when I was a kid. He just loves kids. So I'd like to make him a godfather. I'd like to make Kate-- [DOOR BELL RINGS] Is someone coming over? -It's a magazine subscription. -OK. Could you continue to-- [DOORBELL RINGS] -Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. -Coming. [DOORBELL RINGS] Josh. I thought you had a catering job? Well, what about the Delta Burke event? Josh? -Roy. -Hey, Josh, could you-- -I am so crazy right now. [PHONE RINGING] -This is Roy. Um, yes. I signed a clause. -I am so insane right now. -Tell me what's going on. -I-- -What? -Lyle's cheating on me. -Oh, honey. -Yeah. Lyle's cheating on me. I caught him with a guy at least 10 years younger than I am having sex. -I'm sorry. -Do you know what they were doing? -Yes, I know what they were doing. -I don't even know what to do. I don't know what to do. I'm nuts! I'm just nuts. I'm nuts. -Well, did you talk to Lyle? -He's cheating on me. What am I going to say to him? What is this? -Oh, honey. We didn't know that Lyle was cheating on you. -He's-- he's-- everybody said this to me. I'm an-- I'm an idiot. I'm the last to know. I feel like-- you have nothing with fat here. There's not one calorie in this entire-- I am so-- I see everything now. I see everything. You think this is just once? This is not once, Leslie. This is-- this is-- I feel it. I know it. Everything-- it's like it just hit me. I feel like I'm in-- in some sort of TV movie, you know? I'm the housewife. And I didn't know, and everybody else knew everything that was going on. You know? I just-- it really-- I-- I-- I just-- I just have to keep my head clear because, you know, we have a house together. -Maybe it's for the best. -You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to take all of his clothes in the backyard and set them on fire. Is that wrong? That's what I want to do. And then-- and then I'm going to make him watch. And I'm going to tie him to a chair naked. -I would help you. [CHUCKLES] -It's just I can't believe this is happening to me. I mean, happening to you, I can understand with your crazy husband. Yes, tell me good news. I have no life right now. I'm a single person in the middle of nowhere. I'm floating in the sea. I'm a fish in a pond. -I'm pregnant. -You're pregnant? Whose child is it? I'm kidding. -I'm sorry about Lyle. No, no. -He's a pig. He's a pig. -So you're waiting. How long has this pregnant thing been going on? And you have to eat something. -You know, we'll give him a shower. -I'll do the shower. Don't worry. It'll be my present. -Supports you. And I just want you to [INAUDIBLE] faithful to you. -She does, and she said that to me too. I hate him, but his butt is so cute. [DANCE MUSIC] -This is a crazy town with crazy people. I just wanna go home to Cleveland. -Oh, god. You are always complaining. -I'm not complaining. All right. I am. I'm a Jew, and that's my people do. -Oh, Jesus. [LAUGHS] What do you really want? I don't think you'll-- you'll be happy with anyone. -Who's your Mister Right? -That guy, the bartender. -I'm straight. -A straight guy in a gay bar who's a bartender. It's my favorite thing. -Forget about the bartender. What-- who do you really want? -Oh, I want a guy who's sweet, smart, and sexy and is out to his family and has a job and puts three Equals in his coffee in the morning. Yeah. -You know what? I'm going to-- I'm going to find you your Mister Equal. -How are you going to do that? -I'm going to set you up. I'm going to set you up on 10 dates. When was the last time you were on 10 dates, Mister? -I think it was the '70s. Mary Tyler Moore was still on television. How can I go out on 10 dates? -I can find you 10 guys to go out with. You know what? In fact, I'm going to bet you that I can find you a guy in 10 dates, Mister Equal. -Right. And what happens if I don't find a guy after 10 dates? -Then you can-- you can go home. -Hmm. -Brandon. -Hi. -Hi, honey. Oh, you shut up. Oh, hi. Are you the one that just got dumped? [LAUGHS] Andrew, make me happy, honey. Please stop giving him alcohol. -Mm-hmm. Make it grow. What? [WHISPERING] Ugh. You look like you're doing pretty well though because, you know, if it were me-- where's my drink? I'd be cracking the guy over the head with a bat till he was dead. But you know, that's me. I'm a little volatile. Andrew, make me happy, honey. -Sorry that you just got dumped. I don't know what the guy was thinking -Really? It happens. -I'm Alec. -Josh. -Hi, Josh. So how old are you, anyway? -I'm old enough. How old are you? -Um, 30 something. [LAUGHS] -Oh, my god. Sorry. -Are you seeing anybody? -I'm seeing you right now. -Really? -Yeah, really. -So you're unattached. -Yeah. I'm, uh, unattached. You know what? I think you're cute. -No -Yes, I do. I think you're absolutely cute. I like the goatee. I like the-- I like the whole thing. I like older men. That's what my psychic said. She said-- -Oh, no. [LAUGHS] Your psychic told you in a past life? Oh, my god. Kenny Kingston, hello. Oh, you know, I met Kenny Kingston at the white party. He was so loaded. He was sucking off-- -Kenny Kingston? -Yeah, he you with that I'm Merv Griffin. -Oh, no. -Oh, yeah. Or was that me? -I'm sure it was you. -Well, I don't know who it was. I just know it wasn't me. I don't do older, wrinkled-- no offense. -Oh, my god. He is so mean to you. -But the fetus does. I am sure. Will you turn around? I know I've had you. It was the red party. -I think I would remember if I had you. -Not if you were face down. Come on, remember? I was seven in line. You had a pacifier in your mouth. ALEC (OFFSCREEN): You are so not cute. -You were screaming. Daddy! And I was like, shut up. Don't you remember? Could you say Mildred? Just go, Mildred! Because that was you. -Why don't you stick a glow stick up your ass? -Now you're flirting. Oh, my god. [CHUCKLES] [DISCO MUSIC] -Hey, baby. E-ing? Do you have any more? -Yeah, I do. I do. So you're going to go to the black party? -Oh, Christ. Another fucking party. Hello? Give me another color. [LAUGHING] -[SPEAKING_SPANISH] -Oh, my god. -Who is this? -This is a-- this is a delivery boy. He think that I ordered a burrito. -Burrito? [SPEAKING SPANISH] -Is that your husband? Because you said you weren't attached. -This isn't my husband. This is-- this is my boyfriend. My husband doesn't like to go out. Good meeting you, sweetheart. -Husband? Husband? -Nobody else. That's you. That's you. -This is what I have to look forward to dating? -Aw. -Does this-- does this count as one date? Because if it's not-- -Yes, it does. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): This stuff is too wild. -No, no no, no. It's not too wild. You know, I know it looks wild when it's on the rack. But when it's on, it sort of takes a different life of its own. -I have to start dating again. -I know. I know. That's why-- -How am I going to do this? -You're here. You can do it. You can do it. -I'm old I'm not as cute as I-- -This is not a bad jacket. You can keep the jacket. But you kind of have to lose the sweater. I mean, that's kind of very '84. -Really? -Not younger. Yeah, no, no. I mean, you're too young for this. I mean, how old are you now? -I'm how old? We're discussing age? -How old are you? -This is not kind. This is not kind. -OK, you don't have to tell me. -I'm so unhappy right now. -But lose the sweater. -But you actually-- wait a second. You're actually asking me my age on the day that my boyfriend broke up with me? -Well-- -He's old. -Travis, honey, could you, like, paint a car or something? Take this off. Take this off. I'm going to get another shirt for you. -In front of him? -It's fine. Let me find something, OK? Do you have straight legs, square legs, or belled legs? JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Oh, honey, I don't know. You decide. -Time's up. -Oh, yes, sir. -A little bigger than 34. Spread them. -Yes. Oh. So, um, how long have you been working here? -Shut up. -OK. Um, you don't want me to talk? -Hey, look, do you have $200? -Yeah, I have $200. Why do you-- are you-- are you in trouble? -Do you have $200? Do you want to work something out? -Oh. [PHONE RINGING] Gay for pay. I'm sort of new. I just started dating, and I don't know if I'm at the point where I need to pay yet. -Yeah. OK. Travis! -But if I do need to pay, you will be the one that I will call. -Confusion. Can I see you down front? -I just can't tell you how much I appreciate your, uh-- -Uh-huh. -Little offer. TRAVIS (OFFSCREEN): What do you want, numb nuts? -Is everything all right? It's line one. And when you're finished, could you think about doing some work? OK. Don't get upset. 32s, 33s, and 34s. Only because they're European. -Travis, Motion and Lotion. Cream or Vaseline? Metallic or fur? -And Travis is a little gay for pay boy. He just asked me to pay $200 to have sex with him. -Oh, that. Oh, that. He turns tricks all the time. It's part of the business. Anyway-- -All right. I'm flying. -Listen, I come from a small town. I-- I'm not used to this kind of-- -We'll work it out. Get in there and do this. We don't have all day. Jesus. Travis! Take me to the Roxy. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Macho Latin for masculine white. Cowboy in the valley. That seems like a fun person. [HUMMING] -All right. Let's do it. Oh, my god. He looks like a serial killer. He looks like something from "The Sopranos." Honey, get some sleep. You don't look good. Do you think we could go to Barbra Streisand's website later? -Jesus, Johnny. There's more to life and being gay than Barbra Streisand and show tunes. -Wait a second. What? This is a woman. We're on the woman page. Open, open, open. He seems desperate. That seems perfect for me. Oh, honey, he's 12. The guy's 12 years old. -He's like, hey, how's it going? (DEEP VOICE) Wanna go on a date with me? -(DEEP VOICE) Yeah. Hey, bump. Bump, man. -Oh, put him on the maybe list. Top looking for bottom. A little too specific. -Oh, my god. -He's either Truman Capote or Lee Strasberg. I can't tell. Oh, I pushed the wrong button. That's 65 or older. I'm sorry. Watch this. He's gone. Ooh. -Ugh. Oh. -I think he's sort of cute. -Oh, my god. In like a Sancho Panza type. -Looking but not lost. Looking for that one. Unclaimed treasure. That sounds nice. Look at him. He looks like this. [HIGH PITCHED] Hi, how are you? It's a little too Dukakis. Not that I'm judging. -I liked Dukakis. Did you like Dukakis? -Yeah, I did. I just-- I liked-- I liked Olivia Dukakis. You know, if you lose this bet, you're going to have to take care of my entire business with Claire. You know that? -I told you that's not a problem. I'm going to school just for that. I'm going to school for my MBA. I'm going to double your profits. -Really? -I'm a smart man. -Maybe I should quit right now. -You probably should. And by the way, I'm not going to lose the bet. -Oh, yes you are. -Nice Italian guy. Nice-- -Ooh, Italian guy. -OK, let's look at Italian guys. -Look at him. -Are Jews Italian? Matzoh balls, spaghetti. Oh. Nice Italian guy. -Looks good. -Well, let's email him, I guess. -All right. -I am a recently widowed-- -Oh, my god. -Oh, no. I didn't kill him. Can't say that. I'm a recently single guy. [MAKES PSYCHO SOUND] Shut up. Coming out of a 10 year relationship and looking to get my feet wet. -I don't-- -OK. Should I push Send? -Sent it, baby. Sent it. -Here goes the 10 dates. Date number one. -One. Uno. -Go. -You know, I like video games and stuff, you know? I like to play video games and stuff. And sometimes, you know, I get a little crazy and have to get online and jack off to porn all day. It's like-- but you know, I like to talk to people too. Sometimes you gotta be careful, man, when you're on the computer because you can meet, like, crazy people, whacked out, crazy people. You know what I'm saying? -I'm just a caterer. -Oh, cool. -I'm just a caterer. -Yeah. -Where did you come from? -Oh, I came from-- I came from, uh, back East. Yeah, I came from Brooklyn, New York. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): What do you do for fun? I like to, uh-- yeah, I like to go to bars. I like to drink a lot. I like to party, you know? I like to-- JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Party? -Yeah. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): You mean circuit parties? -Yeah, like, you know, I like to-- no, I like to-- you know, I like to get on a trampoline and jump and down. Do you know what I'm saying? I love doing that stuff, you know? I love it. You know, I mean, I'm a fucking legend, man. You know what I'm saying? -You mean like Lauren Bacall? -I'm not like Lauren Bacall, man. I'm coming from fucking, like, out there. I mean, I don't even-- like there, right there. That's where I'm coming from, man. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Oh. -You know? 'Cause that's where I'm gonna be. I'm gonna be up there. You know, I'm coming from up there, but I'm gonna be up there. You know what I mean? -I know exactly what you mean. -Woo. Man, I-- I gotta go pee. I'll be right back. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): I'll be right here. -OK, thank you. Hey. Hey, I'm sorry. How you doing? What's up? -Oh, hi. -Yeah, I was just up there. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. I was just, uh, in the bathroom. What's the matter? ELECTRONIC VOICE: Goodbye. -You know, it's getting late. -It is. What time is it? I have to pick up my grandmother because she's in her 90s for a very important, um, doctor's appointment at a specialist that only sees people at a certain hour because they're spiritual and it's holistic. You're into that. You know all-- because you're up there. You know all that stuff. Thank you. Keep the change. Thank you. OK. It was really nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. Yeah, yeah. -My grandmother-- she's old. -OK. -She has a walker. -Yeah, tell her I said hi. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): I will. -All right. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Now you take care. -Take it easy. See you later. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Good to meet you. -Good to meet you too. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): I just-- I just felt like-- I didn't think you were really interested, that you were just, you know-- I don't know. This whole dating thing has been a little bit of a nightmare. -Yeah. Well, I mean, this isn't really a date date date. I mean, we're just hanging out. Right? Because I don't want-- if Blink-182 found out that I was dating other people, that would hurt my chances of ever being able to date them. So let's not say date. Let's just say hang out and buddy, buddy. -Blink what? -Blink-182, the band that I'm in love with. This is my favorite because his name is Mark, and he's the best player, 27. Not gay, so there's like a, you know, speed bump. But I can work all that out. Lead singer and guitarist, very good looking man. I'm equally as smitten with him. The drummer has too many tattoos, but I would blow him to meet the guitarist, you know? Oh, here's a ticket. Um, it's not one of their shows. But it's-- they played here at this place. -This is special. -Man, I do like-- and don't let this get out. But like, uh, Marky Mark. Do you remember? He sang. Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. -Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch? -Do you remember? He had hits out. Now he's acting. -Right. Mark Wahlberg. -If he ever-- I don't go anywhere without this, because if he ever performs again, see, I got a laminated backstage pass. -Oh. -So like let's say we're eating right now, and a tour bus zooms by, and we follow it-- you follow those sometimes, don't you? JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Tour buses? -Yes. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Yeah. -You get in your car, and you follow them. And if it happened to be Mark Wahlberg's, and it was Marky Mark, I-- I could go in and meet him. -Right. -So I don't leave the house without that. That's always. That's-- that's just smart, you know? -I think so. -Um, this kid's name is Justin. And I-- hmm. If-- if Blink-182-- oh, don't cover up Blink-182. If Blink-182 wasn't, uh, available, then-- -Justin? What does he do? -Um, he's a singer. -But people say that these guys-- you know, that I-- I-- you know, that's how I date unattainable men just because-- I don't think they're unattainable. -So you feel that the therapy group was for everybody else who was really, like, nuts there. BRYCE (OFFSCREEN): They were out of their mind. Were you not there? -Yeah, no. I agree with you. And I-- I agree 100% with you. BRYCE (OFFSCREEN): I mean, they were cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. Uh, I mean, where-- I'm from Texas. We settle our problems. You know, you just grow up normal and get on with your life. I started with 'N Sync. I mean, you don't just jump into Blink-182, honey. I mean, that's-- JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Oh, I wouldn't want to jump into Blink-182-- -You can't. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): If I haven't done the 'N Sync thing. -You start with 'N Sync, 98 Degrees. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Or even go on from the Backstreet Boys. -98 degrees. Um-- JOSH (OFFSCREEN): There's a group called 98 Degrees? -Uh-huh. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): I just thought it was hot. -They are hot though, man. I tell you what. They're-- they're-- you know. But anyway, I want you to have this because this is how I got started. And who knows? Two years from now, you could be sitting here with-- you know, I don't what band you're going to pick. It could be, you know, like, uh, Third Eye Blind and something and-- -You know, because I'm going to take it home because this-- they're really cute. And I'd I'm going to think about this and memorize all of it. BRYCE (OFFSCREEN): -OK. -And then we will talk another time. -This cover needs to be reworked completely. I-- I don't even know what I can do. -Thanks so much. -OK. Don't-- don't do that. -Oh, I'm sorry. I'll keep it straight. -'Cause I mean, if you don't want it-- -No, no. This is special. -All right. I want you to have it. -I appreciate it. -Stuff like that changed my life early on. -Oh, I'm changed right now just holding it. -OK. All right. -I don't know what I was thinking. -Well, let's get together and, uh-- and do this again because I could-- this is not a good day to just have three magazines. -Oh. -I usually get five, six of magazines. -Oh, well, we'll do that. -OK. -Gotta go. -OK. Yes. -What was your assistant's name? -She's my partner. -Your partner. -Claire. -Claire, yeah. She's a nice lady. -Oh, she's the best. I've known her 20 years. -I was talking to her a little bit at the party. -Your eyes are so blue. -Thank you. Yours are pretty blue yourself. Do you remember my girlfriend? Uh, she was there at the party when we were there that night. -Girlfriend? -The blonde girl. -Girlfriend meaning girlfriend in-- as opposed to-- -She-- I don't know who-- I think I introduced you guys. She was hanging out, but I was all over the place. Everyone was talking to me that night. You know how it is at the wrap parties. Yeah. She's, uh-- she's kind of my girlfriend. I've been seeing her for a few months. When you met her-- her name's Heather, by the way. When you-- when you met her, she was-- we had kind of just started, like, seeing each other already. -Heather is your girlfriend? -Yeah, she's-- she's-- she's my girlfriend. -OK. BILLY (OFFSCREEN): You don't remember her, obviously. -No. No, I don't. But that's OK. -Does that seem to upset you a little bit? JOSH (OFFSCREEN): No, no, no. I just-- I thought this was a date sort of. I thought you were asking me out. But I-- this is sort of awkward. But I'll eat something. Does that make you feel better? -Why did you-- why did you think this was a date? -I don't know. But it's my own fault. Just forget I even said that. -Did you-- did you-- when we met, did you-- did you think that I was gay? -You just sort of kissed me on the cheek. -That was-- probably, I had been drinking. And you were a nice guy. We had a great conversation. -You don't remember what happened. [LAUGHS] -No, what happened? -We-- I feel awkward now. I don't know what to say. But I certainly don't want-- we're working together. But you grabbed me. I mean, you grabbed me, and you took me on the side. And you kissed me on the cheek and the French accent thing a little. I don't know what you said. [LAUGHS] -I was-- I was drunk. I was half-- half kidding. But I'm-- I'm-- I know that you're gay. And, uh-- and after the conversation we had-- one of her-- one of her fantasies or something that she really wants to do is, uh-- she wanted-- she wanted me to be with another man in front of her. I thought that-- I know this is very-- this is-- this is weird too. But I thought that maybe you would be-- I don't know if you-- you swing or if you were seeing somebody or if you were-- that was something you'd be interested in or-- it would be a surprise. It would be-- I would-- I would-- I would-- it would be her and I. And I would-- I would have you, you know, locked in the bathroom or something. -Locked in the bathroom? -Not locked. But kind of hiding, you know, in the closet. -Hiding in the closet? [LAUGHS] -No pun intended. -Been there, done that. Billy. -Maybe this wasn't a good idea. -Billy, Billy, Billy. -Believe me, this is very awkward for me to be even-- I mean, if I wasn't so in love with this girl. She's just-- she's the sweetest girl, and-- and-- but she has this picky side of her. And she wants to try new things. You know the masks they had in-- the guy, the gimp in "Pulp Fiction," you know, with the two little eye holes. You know, and I thought that maybe you could come out with-- with that on. And no one-- she wouldn't know who you were. And, you know, it would-- it would be a one night thing, and that would be it. -This is never going to happen. I'm really sorry. -Yeah, I thought maybe-- well, if you don't like that idea, then maybe what about like a big-- like a big ball gag or something? -Ball gag? Look, I-- I'm just a regular gay guy. I-- this is not for me. -No, but mean, I-- I've seen-- I've been in the shops and have. -I know. I know you have, honey. And it's-- it's not gonna happen. -You think maybe that you could hook me up with one of your friends? -You know, he had problems when he was growing up because, you know, he couldn't really express himself. And the kids used to make fun of him and things like that in school. But I really didn't know until he was in his early 20s. He was engaged, I think, when he was about 20, 19 or 20. And on his 22nd or 23rd birthday-- I'm not sure-- I took him to lunch, and he told me he was gay. -Josh. -Can I help you? -Yeah, you can help me. I want your lunch money. And if you don't got lunch money, I want your lunch every day at school. -Just leave me alone. -Josh, give me your fucking money, or I'm going to tell those girls right back there that you're sweet boy, that you're a little faggot. So give me your damn money. -Stop fucking looking at me. I know what you're thinking. You're undressing me with your eyes. Give me your money, you fucking faggot. -I'm not a homo. Leave me alone, Jack. -I'll tell the whole fucking school. You don't think I'll do it? I see you don't-- here, have a sandwich. -Thank you. -See you tomorrow, Josh. BOY (OFFSCREEN): What was that all about? -Oh, shit. [BELL RINGING] Well, Glenda, the reason I'm here is because I've been in a 10 year relationship, and he left me for younger guy. And, you know, I'm in my 30s now. And I'm not perfect, and I'm not beautiful, and I'm not young. You know? You know, I mean, I just-- you know how it is. It's hard. Now I have to go out into dating world. I have to meet people, and I have-- I don't know how to date. I don't know what kind of bars to go to or what kind of clubs to go to. You know? Here-- here you are. Here's 30s, 20s, 30s, 20s. It's very subtle. It's a change. And all of a sudden, I'm this person. And I feel-- I just feel alone. And I-- that's why I brought my friend with me. And I feel alone, and I feel abandoned. And I-- I just don't know what to do. -Well, god, OK. [SIGHS] It's just-- I know. I know. But it's just wrong. It's wrong, Josh. It's just wrong that, you know-- because, as women-- which I can say that you are a woman. I think it's fair. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Well, I'm not really a woman. -No, you're not. But you could be. And this is the whole thing. Now you know how women feel only because you know we give them everything. And then 10 years later, they get the fetus. They go look for the fetus. And this happened to you. And this is why we are connecting now. -Good. It really hurts. GLENDA (OFFSCREEN): I know. I know. I know it hurts. Here. Here. Just-- just-- just come here. Just come here. It's not gonna hurt that much now. It's not gonna hurt that much now. OK, that's enough. That's enough. OK. You're gonna feel better soon. You're gonna feel better soon. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Thank you, Glenda. [MUSIC PLAYING] -You're late. -Oh, my god. -So I was seeing this guy Anthony, right? Um, we worked at a dot-com company together. They sell sporting equipment specializing in hockey. I know, it's cute. But anyways, I mean, dating's dating. It was fun. But he doesn't like Lenny Kravitz. I mean, Lenny is my dude. He's my man. Sure, he lifts the riff sometimes, but he says that's a problem in our relationship. I mean, I'm not going to give up Lenny. -No, honey. You know what I think? It's only a problem when they know the lyrics to a Sheryl Crow song. OK? Then he's out, you know? No. -All right. -No Sheryl Crow. Mm-mm. No. -So Leo, what's going on with you? -I'm doing all right. There's this asshole Johnny who just moved into my corner, Santa Monica and Vine. He's OK looking, but he's always strung out. I'm gonna tell him to get the fuck out. He's killing my business. OK, I've been in this town for a long time. I've made a lot of contacts. And when someone tries to take over my territory, I just call my enforcer. He'll cut off Johnny's revenue source. -But Leo, I think you're missing the underlying issue here. What about love? -I've got more love than I can handle and twice as much on the weekend. I made more money on Pride weekend than Bill Gates. -You must've been tired. -You know, honey, uh, I really think that you're confusing sex with love. -What's the difference? -Mm-hmm. -Oh, hey, big spender. -Hi, I'm Josh. -Keith. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. -I'm a caterer, so I'm-- -Oh, that explains all the firm eggplant. [CHUCKLES] We should get together sometime. -Get together? -Yeah, yeah. I've got my number here. -Hey, what are you doing, huh? -Oh. Oh, nothing, nothing. I was just-- he's a caterer. We were talking about a party. -I think we need to get going. -Anyway, give me a call, and we'll talk about what we were talking about. That'll be good, you know? Just a call. -Whose kid is this? -Oh, yeah, yeah. This is just a kid we adopted. But that's-- don't worry about it. Call me. -A kid you adopted? -Excuse us. -Please, let me know. -Sorry. -You didn't get the rest of the vegetables. -Oh, Josh. Thank you. I'm too fat. -Take one. -No, no. -Oh, gosh. -Look at these. -Would you like one? -Thank you. -Would you like one? -Well, thank you. -Look at this. Ooh, look at this. Look, look, look. -Kate, you have such great taste. -You have to see these. -Oh. -OK, everyone put your-- -Yeah. -Three. One, two. Wait. -Hold on. -It's not working. -One-- OK. -Take it. -The food was delicious, Josh. -Yeah? -Thank you. -Thank you. Let me do that. This is your party. -So how's the dating? -Does the word Titanic ring a bell? Every guy I go out with is a wacko, and the ones that hit on me are married with children. -Aw, I'm sorry. Don't give up. I know you'll find your Prince Charming. I mean, look how long it took me to find Roy. -And your point is? -Josh. -Leslie, they, uh, need you in there. They're doing the, uh, baby bingo challenge. -Baby bingo. I'm coming. -She's coming. -Oh. -Josh, your desserts were delicious. -Oh, thanks. -You know, I was wondering. I'm having this small get together at my place on Thursday night. Are you available? -Yeah. -Oh. -I mean, I don't know. Maybe. Can I call you? -Yeah, you can call me. Here, take my card, OK? I'll remind you soon. -Did you really like my creme brulee? -Honey, I can take a bath in your creme brulee. -Great. So I'm so-- I'm so glad we finally got to meet. -Me too. Are you, uh-- do you live with someone? Are you married or-- -Um, how do you-- how do you define married? With the ring and everything. Because I have the ring, but it doesn't mean-- you know, it's heterosexual values. So it's-- it's-- -Oh, you're a heterosexual? -No, no, no. -Oh, it's heterosexual values? -Yes. When you say married, you say heterosexual values. You know, when a man is with-- with another man, doing, you know, things-- -So do you live with another man? -Mm, yeah. -Yes? -Yeah. -OK. -He's my roommate. -Roommate? -Yes. -Oh, you live with a roommate. -Yes. Well, you know, sometimes it's late at night and, you know, you have needs. But, you know, he's my roommate. -So it's a roommate that you occasionally have sex with? Charming. -Well, what would you call sex? -Well, two people making love together. -So, basically, uh, I'm sort of a bit alone, you know, between dates and-- Well, you're like-- you a bit alone? -Um, yeah, I guess so. I just, uh-- I just broke up with a guy that I had been with for 10 years. So-- -Oh, my god. You eat a lot of Equal. You know Equal gives cancer? -No, I didn't know that. -Yeah, it's written on some of the package. Maybe it's the other one. The pink one. The pink one gives cancer. It says on it. -Oh, this is the blue. -That's why, like, you know, the-- the place where you go, um-- you know, the-- the-- how do you call it in English? Um, um, the sauna. -Oh, the bathhouses. -OK. Yeah. -I've never done that. -Oh, you should go. No, no. It's OK. Why don't you go to the bathhouse? You can tell me all about it. Go. Tell me everything. I don't think I could do that. I'm not a bathhouses person. -Lots of places here in Los Angeles. Los Angeles is good for that because there's a lot of sauna around. You go, and it's-- you know, it's kind of fun. You don't have to get their phone number or-- or buy them dinner. So you actually save money and you know. -Here you go. -Thank you. -For the bill. And, uh, I just can't thank you enough for all the taxes. -Sure. Thank you very much. -Thank you. It was really nice. It was a pleasure. -You'll, uh, do my taxes. -I'll take care of all that. -Thank you. -I just don't know what to say. It's been-- it's been. -Yeah. Bye. -We'll talk later. I'll be honest with you. I'm new to dating. -Yeah? -You know? Uh-- -Ah, I got you already. -I just-- -You must be one of those who just got out of a relationship. -I was with this guy for around 10 years, and he cheated on me a lot with a lot of young guys, younger than you, you know? -Bummer. -Yeah, you know, like, 19, 20, 21. Annoying. -I've been with two guys. -Really? -Yeah. -Oh, god. -It's kind of hard not to be. Lots of beautiful over here. I can't help it. -I think I could help it. I never cheated on him. -Never? -No. -Absolutely never? -Never. Well, what's cheating? I've flirted a little. -Yeah. -You know, but never kissed or anything like that. Yeah. I think I'm a one-man guy. -Good. -Yeah. I was very true. -You're a good guy. You're a rare breed now, aren't you? -I think there's gotta be other people like me. So tell me about your family. I wanna check you out before I decide that there's gonna be a second date. -My family, huh? -Yeah, you know. -I don't talk about my family. It's just, uh, something I've learned not to discuss. -OK. -So, um, you're a caterer? Is that what you said? -Yeah. -Oh, interesting. -Yeah. -A caterer. -So why don't you talk about your family? -Let's just say when I was a child, a couple of bad things happened to me when I was younger. -You don't talk to your parents at all? -No. I don't talk to my father. Kind of like those baby blue, kind of greenish, kind of like the ocean. Beautiful eyes. -Oh, really? Tell me more. This is all working. -Uh, you know, the sideburns and the goatee. -Uh-huh. -Working the old 1979 YMCA kind of thing. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Who am I? The Indian or the construction worker? -Oh, you're definitely the construction worker. -Oh, yeah? Go ahead. Hit me there. I've been working out. -Huh? Huh? -So what are you trying to say? -Uh, you're a good looking guy, you know? -Oh, OK. Great. -That's all. That's all. I'm not trying to offend you in any kind of way. -I-- please, this is me. I like you. -Goddammit! Excuse me. Can I get a twist of fucking lime in here please? Fucking people in this world. Jesus. Fucking person. -Wait a second. -Lime Please. Like now. Hell no. Oh, no you did not put a-- does this look like a fucking lime? Does this shit look like lime? Lemon. Read my lips. Lemon. -We're out of lime. -Lemon. I said lime. I asked you for lime like 20 minutes ago. You keep on-- you keep on giving me this fucking shit. -We're out of lime. -OK, calm down. -Jesus. -I think you've gone a little too far. -What? -This date is over. -No, this date isn't-- what do you mean, this date is over? -You were totally out of line. -You don't think he was out of-- he was [INAUDIBLE]. -This date is over! Over. This is enough. -Well, fuck you and fuck you. -Fuck you. Oh. I am so, so sorry. -Can I get you another drink? -I don't know. Why don't you get me the bottle? I just-- ugh. So what are you doing later tonight? -I was decorating my aunt and uncle's house a few weeks ago, and Will Smith is our neighbor. -Will Smith? -Yeah. He came over. And we had on that-- that song that he does. "The Men in Black." Oh, fabulous. But you know, I just-- he's annoying. We went over to Madonna's house and had dinner over there. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Madonna? -Madonna, yes. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Wow. -And after that, we went to this club with Madonna. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Really? -When you go clubbing with Madonna, it's fabulous. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Really? -Yeah. Almost as fabulous when you go with me. And did I tell you about the Cameron Diaz? JOSH (OFFSCREEN): No. -She's my neighbor. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Cameron Diaz? -Yeah. So I live next door to her. And she came over. And, um, I guess we had parked in front of her house. But we were having a party. I had cars everywhere. You know, it's the beach, and so all the houses were pretty close together. She came over at like 4:30 in the morning. And hey, guys, can you move your cars? Fabulous. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): 4:30 in the morning? -Yeah. So, um, she was already drunk, so she had a beer with us. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Oh, it's your call. -Oh. Hello? Let me get you to call me at the office tomorrow. No, no, no. It's a great set. I can hook you up with all kinds of [INAUDIBLE]. No, I don't think we can do that. But hey, you might be able to get a featured part. -Was that Cher? -No, no. I wish. She called earlier though. Oh, my god. I was at the airport the other day. And this guy called and, you know, started giving me shit. And so I just tore into him, you know. And I'm walking to the airport. -Who was it? What celebrity? -No, no, I'm not gonna tell you that part. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Oh, come on. -No, no, no. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Oh, please. -No. OK, It was Tom Cruise. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Oh, really? -Yeah, yeah. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): I have a funny story about him. -No, that's great. Yeah, but let me tell you mine. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Oh, cool. Please. -Oh, yeah. He chartered my airplane. We have a corporate jet. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Of course Corporate jet. -He charted it, and I was scheduled to go skiing. And he delayed the flight. Yeah, he kept the plane wherever he was at. Hour and a half, I'm standing there. And he shows up, opens the door on the plane to get out of the plane. And this is a nice plane. -Was the plane-- the plane wasn't moving or anything? -No, no, no. That's on the ground. And I'm standing there with all my fucking luggage. And he gets out, and he says, oh, thank god you're here. Load all my stuff in my Mercedes over there. Out of my airplane. Now, we own the airplane, and he's renting it. And he gets out, and he tells me to put it all in his car. So I told Tom. I said, you know what, honey? You're standing on the mat that has my name on it. You're sitting in a plane that has cups with my names on them. You know, why don't you get your shit out of my plane and put mine on it? He was with some other guy that he went fishing with or something for a weekend? JOSH (OFFSCREEN): A guy that he went fishing with? -Yeah, but you know how all that goes. -No. What, was the guy cute? -No, no. Not at all. Not at all. -And he went fishing? -Yeah. I don't why he'd go fishing with Tom Cruise. I don't get it. -Honey, I would fish with Tom Cruise. -No. But Arnold. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Schwarzenegger? -Arnold Schwarzenegger. Oh, yeah. He's great. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Did you sleep with him? -We-- no. We'd ski with him. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): He's married to Maria, who's one of the Kennedys. -Right. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Did you ever sleep with a Kennedy. -No, no. I would have liked to. But they-- you know, my chance is over now. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Oh, I don't think he was gay. -No, but I could have converted him. [BELL RINGING] -The bet is off. Everyone has an attitude. They're all on, like, X and K and Y and Z and this special K and Pop Tarts and Rice Krispie squares. -Ooh, I love Pop Tarts. -Stop it. I will smack you right here in front of everybody. I don't even care. -Would that help you? -Yes. Stop it. -Come on, just a few more. Let me-- -Oh, go, go, go, go. -What? -I got a great guy for you. -Who? -Oh, he's an ad executive. Oh, do you know those, uh-- the frog thing? You know the Bud. (FROG VOICE) Bud, Bud. -Oh, yeah. Those are cool. -Yeah. He didn't do those. But he knows the guy who did. -So what's he look like? -Uh, Robert Redford. -Yeah? -Yeah. -All right, all right. A couple more. But that's it. -A couple, a few. -A couple. -Eight, nine, 10 more. -I hate you. -You better stop it. -I'm gonna have the chicken teriyaki. I will have the-- -You get two sides. -Oh, OK. OK. Um, the mashed potatoes and the green beans. -Great choice. You're gonna love that. -Barbecue chicken. Same sides. -OK. You got it. Can I get that menu? -Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry. -3 o'clock. -Dinner ready at 7:30. -Don't ask, don't tell. Military time. 3 o'clock. Look behind you. Look around. Look behind you. Don't be obvious. Don't be occuous. Look behind you. -Oh, my god. There must be something at the door. -There he is. -Very cute. But honey, there's no way that I'm going to actually talk to him. -No, no, no, no. There he is. I'm telling you. That's him. -That's Mister Right? -Let me tell you something, baby. -What, baby? -If you drink, they will come. -What are you talking about? -It's true. -You're crazy. -30 seconds. He's gonna get out of his chair. He's gonna walk past our table. Then you will then give him a look kind of like this. He'll go into the bathroom. He'll come back out of the bathroom in three minutes, sit down right there. And that is where you'll begin. -How do you know all this? What are you, Kreskin? -God, he should be up by now. 10, nine, eight, seven, six. -This is silly. -Five, four, three, two, one. -You're wasting your time. -So you had the teriyaki? -Can I ask you a question? -Yeah. -Do you ever have those days where you're just all about being right? -Yeah. -All right. I bow down to you. You're perfect. I'm just a terrible complete idiot. -We want more. We want more. -So what's he going to do now? -I know this sounds completely cheesy, but I can't-- I was staring at you over there and-- I'm Craig, by the way. -Hi, Craig. I'm Josh. -How are you, Josh? -Hi, what's your name? -Brandon. -Brandon, I'm so sorry to be staring at you. But, um, I can't help but think, do you take Hans's Pilates class, six o'clock crunch? -Uh, no. You do Pilates, don't you? -Yeah. -You don't do Pilates? -No, I don't. -So what do you do? -I, uh-- I go to school. -Oh, really? Where do you go to school? -UCLA. MBA. -MBA. Nice. -So what do you do? -Yeah, I'm a director. I want to be a director. Right now I'm doing feng shui. Do you know what feng shui is? It's, uh-- it's sort of harvesting the chi energy of a specific atmosphere, an environment, and putting it kind of in flow with, uh-- well, with the rest of everything else. With spirits and-- this place here is a complete clusterfuck. There's not that clear flow of-- of chi. -Right. -Do you work somewhere else while you're, um, going to school? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. I work over at Mickey's. -You work at Mickey's? -Yeah. -God, I'm there like three nights a week. I've never seen you there. When do you work? During the week or-- -Yeah? Oh, don't we all? That's so funny. -Listen, some friends and I-- we're gonna get together and go to the Firehouse to go dance. A good friend of mine-- he's a DJ from London. You know, he's like very kind of trance music. You know, there's this whole thing. It's gonna be fun. And my friend Tommy always brings a couple little party bowls, if you're into that or anything. So, uh, well, I'll be over there. I'll be at the bar at 10:00. And if you want to show up, um, that'd be great. -Sure. -Yeah? -Yeah. -All right. Cool. Listen, um, I'll meet you over there at the bar at 10:00. Yeah? Hey, it was so good meeting you. -Oh, yeah. Great meeting you. -You take care. -OK. -That was one of the most degrading things that I've ever had in my entire life. -I'm sorry. But he was really cute. -Mm-hmm. He was actually adorable. He looked like a soap opera star. -Oh, you're doing so well. You're almost cured. Please come back, OK? Bye bye. Goodbye. -Bye. Good night. -Josh. -Yeah? -Uh, what are you doing for lunch tomorrow? -I will be eating food. -I want to know if you want to have lunch with me. -Why? -I want to get to know you more. -Wait, wait, wait. Are you asking me out on a date? -Yeah. I'm asking you out on a date. -Yeah, sure. We could have lunch. -OK. -Yeah. I eat. You eat. We could do it together. It would be a fun thing. -Let me come get you tomorrow. -You want to call me now? -No, no. I just wanna put it in my phone. -I don't really want to be in that phone, because if we break up, it's really hard to get me out of it. And it's got all sorts of little things in it. And you can only put three numbers in and then-- I know, then an email comes through to attach it. And they don't let you. And they only give you three things. And it becomes very Nazi-ish. -OK, OK, OK. Uh-- -So why don't I just, um, give you my card? And, uh, here. OK. Yeah. That's me. And that's my work number. And there's my cell number there. And I also can be faxed, and I can be emailed because Claire's on email all the time. So I'm very easy to, uh -Oh. -And then I have a cell phone too. -I'll call you. -OK. -Bye. -You'll call me? OK, call me. Because that's how we have lunch is when you call. -I like your smile. -OK. I was just shocked you wanted to go out with me. -I don't know. I guess it's just been a while for me. -What's been a while? -Just really liking someone. It's just it's been kind of hard. It's just avoiding, that whole wall of avoiding intimacy, really caring about someone. It's just hard. -Let it off your chest. Get it out. -It's been-- it's been hard. -Why? What? -I've-- I've been-- my life, my family. You were talking about being together, you know, with your family. And that was just like one thing for me that I couldn't relate to. I can't be happy about my family. Things haven't been good. I'm-- my parents have been separated. My dad, you know. He-- he's an alcoholic. You know, I was abused. Ever since I was 14 on the street, helping support my dad and his addiction. Just me and my brother, my little kid brother. He was 12. I-- I made sure he'd never do anything I wouldn't do. I made sure I-- I was the man. I was the guy who took care of everything. I took care of my dad. I took care of my little brother. I took care of everything and everybody. And now, it's-- now I'm-- it's a little different now. -What you gotta do is you gotta start creating a new life for yourself. You know? That's what I have to do too. I mean, Lyle left me just like that. Lyle cheated on me for years. And I knew it. In the back of my brain, I knew it. You know? Now you're gonna make me cry. -Thanks. -Thank you. -What are you doing later tonight? -Um, nothing. I was gonna go to maybe a movie or something. -Do you wanna-- -You wanna go to a movie or maybe get some dinner or-- -Do you want to stay the night? -I don't think we should do that yet. I mean, don't you think we should get to know each other a little better, you know, before-- I mean, I want to. Sure, yeah, I mean, I'd like to. But I just-- I think I should know you and you should know me. I don't want, you know, it to be like that. -I'm sorry. -No, no. Don't be sorry. I have a four date rule. You know? And I-- I'm sorry. -A four date rule? -Yeah. Three dates seems so common, and I want a four date rule. I wanted to be a little different. -You can't give up in life and throw your hands up. I mean, it's just words of wisdom. Find somebody who really does appreciate him because he's a great human being. You know, life is strange. Relationships between a man and a woman are not much different from relationships between a man and another man. In life, you want to be loved, and you want to give love in return. And if you can find somebody that's sincere and trustworthy and not a womanizer or, in my son's case, a man-izer, I guess you'd call it. Or whatever. You know. He needs to go onto bigger and better things. That's all. -This is so cool. Thank you. -You showed up. -And you clean up. -Oh, because I had my little goatee? Well, I shave it. I have it. I'm, you know-- my mother and my sister away in Chinatown. -You sound nervous. -Oh, me? I'm not nervous. Here. We'll order in a second. -You're nervous. -I'm very nervous. -I think that I'm going to do something really stupid and ruin all of this. I feel like I'm with Ken. -That's really-- Ken? -Ken and Barbie. -Oh, thank you. That was nice. -But you're Ken with a penis, I'm hoping. -Did you date women before yourself? Or were you with a girl when you were younger? -Everybody dated girls. -I mean, I had-- when I was in high school, I had a girlfriend. But I always knew I was, you know-- -You always knew. The whole thing about growing up and just being a little too fond of "The Hardy Boys." You know what I mean? That was the first thing for me. That's sort of when I got ingrained. -"The Hardy Boys?" Really? -Yeah. Oh, no doubt. Parker Stevenson, woo. -My mom always had a thing. I was on a diet before I could walk. -January what? -What's the exact date? -No. Yeah. -January 13. -Well, what is that as a sign? -Oh, Capricorn. -What are Capricorns? Besides beautiful. -I'm not making you nervous, am I? -No, you're making me so happy. -Really? -Capricorns are, uh, smart and perfectly ordinary. -What are Cancers? -Um, it's a disease that you don't want. -That's what I am. -No, then it's something that I want. I want that. What are Cancers? I don't know. I don't know anything about the signs. I'm sure we're not allowed to know. -Oh, you're ridden with guilt. If you stop-- if you move from the napkin to the bottle again, you're really going to-- -Oh, OK. -I'm going to make you promise here. -The lettuce is on par. -I'll feed this to iguana. I have an iguana. Do you like iguanas? -You have an iguana in your house? Honey, you can have anything you want in the house. I don't care. -You don't mind large reptiles? -No, I want a large reptile. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Josh, I feel your aura is just popping out. What's happening? -Well, Glenda, I feel like, uh, the mirror has two faces. I finally found someone. -I knew there would be a show tune before we left today. -I met this guy, and he's smart, and he's sexy. And he's got a job and a car, and he doesn't live in it. He's, uh-- he's fabulous. And I do not use the f-word lightly. This group has really done a lot to me. And I just want to say in front of everybody-- because a lot of you know that I had dated Leo. And Leo, it's not you. And I-- I'm really sorry. You're a great kid, but you've got all this stuff going on. You're bisexual. And you-- and you want people to pay your way and take you places. And it made me feel like-- even though I know that I was not one of your customers, you made me feel that way all the time. -It doesn't bother me. Really. I'm fine. -So you're all getting better. You're just-- it's-- you're all-- you have to get better. I'm tired. I'm just-- -We're OK? -Yeah. -Aw. GLENDA (OFFSCREEN): Oh, look at all of us. Look at this love. OK. I think that's enough. -Oh, Glenda, we owe it all to you. -I know. -For the good witch. -Thank you. Thank you. WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): Do you know what I did with that big bag of jewelry? -Which big bag of jewelry? WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): Nevermind. I've got it. I've got to do this thing tomorrow. -What are you doing? -Faye Dunaway. She's doing that movie. ROY (OFFSCREEN): You're doing Faye Dunaway? -Huh? NICK (OFFSCREEN): You're doing Faye Dunaway? -I'm not doing Faye Dunaway. I know all you men. That's what you want. Two women. Ugh. The dream fantasy. No, I'm doing that movie. -The costumes for her new movie, "Bonnie and Clyde." She's back. She's a hooker. So who is this client? -Um, you-- uh, it's, uh-- WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): Wow. You don't really know, huh? -The new project we're working on. It's actually not my account. It's Jimmy's. So let Jimmy go out with him. Jimmy's going to go out. But it's probably a good idea if I go as well. What are you all over me for? I'm making money. Come on. WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): I'm making more money than you. What do you need? -I need to wear a shirt. -You look good. -Here, why don't you get out of the closet, and I'll find it? -You sure you know what I'm looking for? -You want-- what do you want? A blue shirt, I'll bet. -A blue shirt. -OK. Is that fine? -There's so many fucking clothes. Yeah. -Well, that's why we have such a big closet. What would go with this? Don't you wanna stay home with me? -How about a shovel of dirt? -Why don't you call them and-- can't you-- can't you get out of it? Why can't Jimmy do it? -Jimmy's doing it. I already told you Jimmy's doing it. It'll be probably like midnight. That's all. Excuse me. -Good evening, sir. Party of one? -No, no. Two. Uh, I'm on a date. He'll be here on any minute. -OK. Can I start you with something to drink? Perhaps a glass of wine, iced tea? -Um, OK. Wine. -Wine. Which one would you like? -Um, Merlot. -A glass of Merlot? -Yeah, of course. WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): Oh, no. What about this thing? You think this is too trashy? Or is it classy trashy? -No. -Is it? Is it like a trashy classy? -It's-- it fits with the rest of the stuff. -Yeah. -Hey, Josh. How you doing? Hey, listen, I'm really sorry. I know that our relationship is based on trust. And you know how much that means to me. So I am giving you a call. I got totally hung up at the ad agency. And I got stuck with a last minute client from in town I have to be showing. And that's the reason I gotta run over to the Standard, have a nice meal, go to Skyy, have a few drinks. And then they want to see the sights. -Keep talking. Keep talking. Fucking asshole. -You can tell my assistant is just wound up and is raring to go. -Assistant? Now I'm your assistant? -So I've gotta run, sweetheart. -You want some coffee? You want me to go get you some coffee? -I promise that I will make it-- -Do you want me to give you some dictation? -I promise you that date number four is going to be amazing. -Client? What am I, a chopped meat? -You're really special. -Maybe I should, uh, take your phone calls for you if I'm your assistant. Shouldn't I take your phone calls for you? I think I could have summed that up in about three words. -I'm so sorry. -How sorry are you? -You're really beautiful. Your eyes are amazing. -Keep talking. It's getting better. -How about if-- let me take you to a little restaurant Le Stella and, uh, get a table for two and kick everyone else out of the restaurant. We'll go out on the town. You tell me where you want to go. And we'll spend an obscene amount of money. -That sounds absolutely fabulous. What are we waiting for? -Let's go. -Let's go. [PHONE BEEPING] [DANCE MUSIC] -Jesus Christ! Hey, you piece of shit. Oh, my gosh. What is it with me and guys in Jaguars? Ugh. (SINGING) Papa, can you hear me? Papa, can you see me? Papa, could you help me not be frightened? [CAR HORN] -Brandon. So it's a long drive to Cleveland. -I don't know why you're going to Cleveland, Josh. But fine. -The bet's over. You lost. I won. -Don't hate me. -I don't hate you. -I love you. Call me. -I will. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Fax me. -It's in the mail. -Email me. -Um, this is a long shot, but is your name Josh? -Yeah. And your name is Jack. -Jack Langford. -Yeah. I know it. -We went to school together. -Yes, we did. What are you doing here? -Um, I'm just waiting for a train. I'm going back to Cleveland to see my mom. -You too? Me too. I'm going back to see my mom. -Oh, my god. -Yeah. I'll be there a while. I don't know how long. How long are you gonna be back? -Uh, about a week and a half. What are you doing here in LA? -Well, I've lived in LA around 10 years, and I just, uh-- -Really? -I broke up in a relationship, and it's been a pretty bad couple months. So I'm going back to Cleveland for a while to see what happens. -I mean, if some guy breaks up with you and hurts you here in LA, going back to Cleveland isn't going to make you feel any better. I almost did that. -Did you break up with someone? -My last boyfriend. -Boyfriend? JACK (OFFSCREEN): Yeah. -You're gay? JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Oh, sweet revenge. You caused me a lot of therapy. I'll tell you that. I hate to, uh, say that. I'm sorry. -No, I-- it's me who should be apologizing. Hey, look, can I just say that I was a 100% asshole when I was a kid. And it may not mean much, but if I could just apologize for the shit that I did to you when I was a kid. I mean, I didn't know who I was. I didn't know what I was doing. And I was just a jerk. -I've just waited my whole life to hear this. I don't know what to say. I'm sorry. -Here's your half caff decaf with a twist. Hey, big spender. What can I get you? -I will have a, uh, hot tea with, uh, Earl Grey. -Room for milk? -No. No cream. ANNOUNCER (ON PA): Last call for Cleveland. -So you want to take a train ride? -Yeah. -Have you ever been on a train before? -I have. -Is it like "Murder on the Orient Express?" -Yeah, but I'm not going to be Lauren Bacall. -Speaking of Bacall, do you remember Mrs. Garrett's eighth grade English class? -The wicked witch of West Hall? Who could forget her. I had nightmares for years. -Remember the time she found her trunk filled up with SpaghettiOs? -Did you do that? -I was lucky to graduate. -Didn't you set the record for the lowest grade point average at Shaker Heights? -Yeah. But there was one class I aced. -Which one? -Detention. You know, Josh, I still feel so guilty. What can I do to make it up? -Um, do you have a Neiman Marcus card? [HORN HONKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Travis? -You know about him. -No, I don't know about him. What are you talking about? -He just asked me if I wanna have sex with him. -You first? I've been working all this time. He goes for you? You goddamn son of a bitch. -All right. -I don't mean anything personal by this, but you're smoking crack. -You're in menudo. -I just feel like there's been a little hostility in there room, and maybe it couldn't be as warm. -How much warmer can I be? -Oh, this is so "Liza at the Palace." -Who are you? I'm-- [SINGING] You're Liza. I'm Lorna. -Of course. I forgot. What was I thinking? MAN (OFFSCREEN): Alternative take. [LAUGHING] -You need to put some fudge in the accounts. -(WITH ACCENT) You need fudge in the accounts. JEAN-LUC (OFFSCREEN): Exactly. [MUMBLING] Exactly -Fu-- fudge in the-- in the account? Is that it? JEAN-LUC (OFFSCREEN): Yeah. -Oh, yeah. OK, OK. -You know, I could make you do more sets. Hey, my eyes are here. MAN (OFFSCREEN): Sorry. -Thank you. MAN (OFFSCREEN): Sorry. -That's what you want, a man who will stay at your feet and lick you. All right. WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): Where? MAN (OFFSCREEN): Uh, cut. -Oh, Liza, you always get what you want first. I hate you! -Oh, god. -I don't understand a fucking thing you're-- JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Check. -Talking about, actually. -Oh. -Who can turn the world on with a smile? -No. -I'm very proud of him. I really am. BRANDON NARRATING: Josh has three loves in life-- food, Streisand, and love. This is Josh, my best friend. This is me. I'm Brandon. I'm going for my MBA at UCLA. In five years, I'll own the stall. -I just came by the house before I, uh, went out to Palm Springs. -Ow! -What the hell is going on here? It's over. It's over. Would you just get out of the way? BRANDON NARRATING: In West Hollywood, bad news travels fast. -Are you the one that just got dumped? BRANDON NARRATING: Josh had it rough in high school. Sometimes he still has it rough today. -This is a crazy town with crazy people. I just want to go home to Cleveland. I want a guy who's sweet, sexy, smart. BRANDON NARRATING: For a man who was just blown out of a 10 year relationship, Josh was in surprisingly good spirits. He was dumped, but I was determined to do something about it. -I'm gonna bet you that I can find you a guy in 10 dates. -What happens if I don't find a guy after 10 dates? -You can go home. BRANDON NARRATING: But we had to get him ready first. -You can keep the jacket. But you kind of have to lose the sweater. I mean, that's kind of very '84. BRANDON NARRATING: Josh wants more than a one night stands. He's looking for love. But most of all, he just wants to be appreciated. -Oh, my god. He looks like a serial killer. He looks like somebody from "The Sopranos." -I'm coming from fucking, like, out there. I mean even like there, right there. That's where I'm coming from, man. -If Blink-182 found out that I was dating other people, that would hurt my chances of ever being able to date them. So-- and he's the bass player, 27. Um, not gay. So there's like a, you know, speed bump. But I can work all that out. -And I would-- I would-- have you, you know, locked in the bathroom or something. -Locked in the bathroom? -Not locked, but kind of hiding, you know, in the closet. -Hiding in the closet? [LAUGHING] -No pun intended. -Been there. Done that. -The date is over! Over! This is enough. -You wanna call me now? -No, no. I just want to put it in my phone. -I don't really want to be in that phone, because if we break up, it's really hard to get me out of it. And it's got all sorts of little things in it. And you can only put three numbers in. BRANDON NARRATING: Of course, what's really funny is how love sometimes turns up where and when you least expect it. From "Will and Grace," and "My Wife and Kids," Jason Stuart. From "Married With Children," David Faustino. From "The Bold and the Beautiful," Sean Kanan. From "Too Close for Comfort," Jim J Bullock. From "Baywatch," Alexandra Paul. Introducing Christopher Cowan as Brandon and the unique comedy of Judy Tenuta. -You know, because as women-- which I can say that you are a woman. I think it's fair. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Well, I'm not really a woman. -No, you're not. But you could be. BRANDON NARRATING: "10 Attitudes," is a fun, breezy, and hilarious film. -"10 Attitudes" began as an idea that was discussed between two friends over lunch. And somewhere in between, I guess, the hamburger and the iced tea, Jason Stuart said to me, you know what, Michael? It is so tough to be a semi-attractive, 30 something gay man in Los Angeles, to find love. Sex is easy, but love is hard. -I kept telling him how difficult it is to, you know, fall in love and get married and find the perfect guy. -And I said, Jason, that's an interesting concept. And it might make a great film. -So I said, Michael, let's, you know, take my idea of dating and sort of put this together. And then we did. And then what happened is the film just totally evolved. -And that night, I went home, opened up the PowerBook, pounded out a story, showed it to Jason the next morning. He and I worked on it for a month or so. And then we decided to shoot the movie ourselves. -And we started doing this short film. We're going to do a short film, totally improvised. It was going to be called "Dating." -We got a lot of great, great talented friends and family who acted in it, worked on the crew, financed it. -OK. Let's start. -This is really cool. -Jason, go ahead. MAN (OFFSCREEN): Good night, Jason. Jason, you don't have to watch it. ALEXANDRA (OFFSCREEN): Are we gonna do a behind the scenes of-- what's this called? -It's called "Dating." -This is behind the scenes of "Dating?" MAN (OFFSCREEN): "Dating." This is the making of "Dating." -It became a very creative process of-- we never really knew where the film was going, which was my idea. I didn't want to know where the film was going. And of course Michael, being the big producer guy, director, wanted to know where everything was going. So between the two of us, we met someplace in the middle. -And then about a year or two later, we did the film festival circuit. And, uh, the rest is history. The interesting thing about this production is that most of the film is improvised. I wrote the story along with Jason. And from scene to scene, I would discuss backgrounds of the other characters with them, with the other actors. Jason never knew from scene to scene what was going to happen. So his reactions are totally real. -One of our fantasies or something that she really wants to do is, uh, she wanted-- she wanted me to be with another man in front of her with her. JASON (OFFSCREEN): And little did I know when we were doing this film is Michael-- what Michael would do-- he would give each of us different pieces of information and not tell each other. So I didn't know probably most of the filming that Chris's character, Brandon, was in love with my character, Josh. -What I wanted to do with the character of Josh was to create kind of an everyman character and someone that everyone could relate to, gay or straight, male or female. Someone who's lived his life well, who's been loyal to his mate, but has been dumped on. -I'm sorry. -No, I-- it's me who should be apologizing. -That was the moment I fell in love working with Michael as the director because he created an atmosphere that was comfortable for me to do my best work in that scene. -I was a 100% asshole when I was a kid, and it may not mean much, but if I could just apologize for the shit that I did to you when I was a kid. I mean, I didn't know who I was. I didn't know what I was doing, and I was just a jerk. [CHUCKLES] -I've just-- I've waited for this for-- MAN (OFFSCREEN): Go back. It's OK. And action. -I've just waited my whole life to hear this. I don't know what to say. I'm sorry. Most of the time, as an actor, you have to use substitutions, and you have to find a way to make the scene work from you or relate to something that happened in your life. To me, it was so real because for you guys at home that actually sort of happened to me in that way. Um, I just really wanted to hurt you. And now I don't. Um-- JACK (OFFSCREEN): Well, you had every right to. -I just-- I'm sorry. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): It's all right. -I would say about 70% to 80% of the film is improvised. Now, if anyone can figure out which scenes are scripted, they should email me. And they'll receive a director's cut version of the original "10 Attitudes." OK? Because I dare them to find which scenes are scripted and which scenes are improvised. It's all kind of interwoven, I hope, creatively. Well, there's kind of an obscure reference to a 1972 film, French film, called "And Now My Love," by Claude Lelouch. In that film, the male character spent the entire movie trying to find a certain girl. And there was a symbol for when he would know that this was the right girl for him. And somehow, he got into his mind that it would be a woman who would put three cubes of sugar in her coffee. -And, um, Earl Grey if you have it. MICHAEL (OFFSCREEN): And I use the same device in "10 Attitudes." I update it, and I make it three Equals instead of sugar. But it's the same idea, and it works the same way. We have a lot of great actors in this film. It's led by Jason Stuart, who is a great guy. He's also my co-producer and co-writer. And he really brings a fantastic improvisational touch to the table. -Now, I know you didn't just put fucking lemon in my drink. -Calm down. -Wait a minute. I asked you for lime. Does this look like a fucking lime? -Steven. -Lemon, lime. -It has some green on it. Do you see some green on there? -Yellow and fucking green. Fuck. Goddammit. I keep telling you. You don't fucking listen to nobody. -Steven. MAN (OFFSCREEN): You're out out of line. -What? -This date is over. -No, this date isn't-- what do you mean, this date is over? -This is totally out of line. -You don't think he was out of-- he was at it first. -The date is over! Over! This is enough. -Well, fuck you and fuck you. -Fuck you. Oh. I'm not happy now. I'm so not happy now. -I got to tell you, David Faustino-- I've never seen him funnier than in this movie. -And I just called him, and I said, would you do this? And he said, sure. He just popped over there and did it for me. -If you don't like that idea, then maybe what about like a big-- a big ball gag or something? -Ball gag? Look, I-- I'm just a regular gay gun. I'm-- this is not for me. -But I-- I've seen-- I've been in the shops. -I know. I know you have, honey. And it's-- it's not gonna happen. -You think maybe that you could hook me up with one of your friends? -Scott Kennedy, um, who's now got his own special on Comedy Central. -I don't go anywhere without this, because if he ever performs again, see, I've got a laminated backstage pass. So, like, let's say we're eating right now, and a tour bus zooms by, and we follow it. You follow those sometimes, don't you? JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Tour buses? -Yes. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Yeah. -You get in your car, and you follow them. And if it happened to be Mark Wahlberg's, and it was Marky Mark, I could go in and meet him. -Right. -So I don't leave the house without that. That's always-- that's-- that's just smart. You know? -I think so. -Judy Tenuta is a dream. -Judy Tenuta. Everybody knows her. She's just the queen. -Every time she's on screen, people want to see more. That's why we added her to the outtakes. She brilliant. -And so how old are you? MAN (OFFSCREEN): 21. -Oh, please. I don't want to hear about your dad problems. -I want to fuck each and every one of you in here. -All at once? -Glenda, the good witch. -Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you. Go away. -We have Sean Kanan from "The Bold and the Beautiful," and "General Hospital." -I'm a director. I want to be a director. Right now, I'm doing feng shui. Do you know what feng shui is? BRANDON (OFFSCREEN): Yes. -It's, uh-- it's kind of harvest the chi energy of a specific atmosphere, an environment, and putting it kind of in flow with, uh, well, the rest of everything, with spirits. This place here is a complete clusterfuck. -You know, and my best pal Alexandra Paul, who's been a movie star, who did this movie for free-- -And she and Jason are so terrific together. They are best friends in real life, and it shows on camera. -You're such a food snob. JOSH (OFFSCREEN): Miracle Whip? -Miracle Whip. -Look at me and say Miracle Whip. -Stop it. -And I saw Skiffy peanut butter in the other room. I'm telling you right now. -Skiffy? -Yeah. This is it. Miracle Whip, Skiffy. You're no longer my sister. I'm telling you right now. It's over. It's over. -Well, I didn't think you were gonna come over. [LAUGHS] Would you like a sandwich with tuna and Miracle Whip? -No, I'd rather be dead. -Jim J Bullock plays a owner of a clothes shop in West Hollywood. -And Jim was driving around West Hollywood. And I saw him, I said, Jim. Jason. I need you to be in my movie. He said, call me. I'll do it. That was it. That's casting. -Oh, no. Travis? -You know about him, right? -No, I don't know about him. What are you talking about? -He just asked me if I wanted to have sex with him. -You first? I've been working all this time, and he goes for you? You goddamn son of a bitch! -All right. -I'm sorry. What were you saying? -We had screenings at the film festivals. People would just die laughing when they saw him on screen. -OK. Don't get upset. 32s, 33s, and 34s. Only because they're European. What size? Medium? -Yeah, medium. -I'm being kind. -Bitch. -Just try this. -Oh, I can't wear this. -I know it looks horrible now. It looks horrible now. -You're crazy! -But you have to get the whole outfit together. -Why would I like that? -It's not going to work with what you have on. -I'm gonna look like Deee-Lite. -OK. If you feel that bad about it, we won't go that far. -I'm trying to get a guy, not scare the shit out of somebody. -So I think very, very soon in the scene, what I'll have you guys do is-- is-- is she'll come in with the mail. And you go, oh, I have to tell Carlos. I have to tell Carlos something. Let's go back to the kitchen. And you guys get in there. We'll track all the way. And at least I see all of this. This is great production value. You guys have a nice catering company. -It's so messy. -I'll straighten it out. I'll have my staff straighten it out to be more angled. You're right. -For my character. -For your character. Martin and I will scout it, and we'll find something that works, you know, light-wise. Ozzy and Cher? Is that what you said? WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): Sharon. Sharon. MAN (OFFSCREEN): Sharon. -Oh, Sharon. -His wife. Yeah. Oh, I guess. I don't know. I'm trying not to get sued. But you're not going to say I'm about to-- you know, meeting Ozzy. Probably Sharon and the kids will be there. It's a whole thing. You know, we're going to meet, you know, in Palm Springs. And it's just, you know-- it's just the weekend and I'll be back, you know. Kiss, kiss, hug, hug. Flowers, nice. End of scene. That's it. -OK. -OK. -OK? -And this will just-- if anything, this will just be-- -Can you go back to the second verse again? The very first one you did was great. The second one, I'm not sure about. But that first one was-- yeah. JOHN (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, just do the inside and the hard. OK, yeah. -It was really nice. -(SINGING) Away above the rain where I can see the reason for this pain. -There's one high note in the second verse you sing that might be really cool to have a harmony a third above that. -(SINGING) Inside my heart and fell apart. -Why don't you do that? -The note is so much lower than what it should be. You know it's-- [SINGING] It's kind of hard to find it sometimes. So-- but it was really a nice performance. I mean, I think we're just going to save it anyway. -(SINGING) Cold, empty nights and a million strangers' eyes. Here in your arms, I'm beginning to leave behind all the loneliness I knew. Here in the land of the loving, I found you. -When we were first creating this whole project, one of the things that moved me and motivated me was the killing of Matthew Shepard and the fact that at that same time, there was a cover article on "Newsweek," that talked about gay conversion, and that-- intimating that being gay or bisexual was a disease. And they were looking for a cure. And I thought that was so destructive to young people growing up, that message that it was sending and encouraging, you know, future tragedies like Matthew Shepard. So I wanted to do something that would address young people who were going through crises of identity and to show them that there are many, you know, wonderful people both in the gay and bisexual community that lead happy, fulfilling lives. And, uh, everyone searches for love in their life. And that's one of the main motivations of life. And this film shows that. It just happens to be about a man who's gay. It could be about a woman who's straight. It could be about anyone, really. -That's supposed to be pick up Martin, but we abbreviated it. And it just says pick Martin, which doesn't mean to pick Martin. It means pick up Martin. MAN (OFFSCREEN): Oh, OK. -Good. OK. And then we've got editing. Then we're approving, the poster, which we did. -48 from concept, design to execution and distribution. Now we're recording the voice over. -Can I have you say Sean-- -Kanan. -Kanan. -Kane. -Kane? -Kanan. -Starring, from "Will and Grace," and "My Wife and Kids," Jason Stuart as [SPANISH]. [LAUGHING] -Cut. -Then we have to pick up the DigiBeta. Let me ask you a question. Do you guys make digital copies from a DigiBeta, you know, instead of just a VHS? Then we go back to editing. Then after editing, we have dinner. Then we resume the editing and complete it. And then we celebrate. -To fame, money, and attention. -To cutting. OK. Now the wrap party. -Who has the champagne, baby? MAN (OFFSCREEN): I say we skip to celebrating right now. -Yeah. Cut to the chase, baby. Go right to the celebrating. Hello? We opened at the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian International Film Festival, and we were the first film to sell out that festival out of 85 films. -And he says-- the guy says, the film is sold out. I said, please. There must be something wrong with the computer. I can't believe you guys. And I'm sitting here, just being Mister Diva. And I said, I can't believe-- I said, are you sure? I mean, it-- it couldn't be sold out. Now people are going to call. They're not going to be able to get the tickets. It's going to be a whole failure. I'm going to be sitting there by myself. And they said, no. Jason, the film is sold out. -So there were 650 people in a theater that held 600. All of us associated with the film gave up our seats happily, sat on the floor of the theater. The lights dimmed. The movie started. And then for the next 90 minutes, people laughed. And then they cried. -I was totally shocked and floored. -And that was the most fulfilling feeling I've ever had as a filmmaker, to know that something that was just in my head a couple years earlier now was moving people in such a way. And then we went to Barcelona. -And I was gonna go. I was at the airport. It was July fourth, and they had this terrible shooting. And the whole airport was shut down. -All the stars. -Yeah, it's good. I mean, you know, I make good money. I like it. -I hate him, but his butt is so cute. [LAUGHING] Martin Lukey accepted the award for Best Picture on our behalf., not even knowing, because it wasn't in English, that we were getting two awards. He thought we were only getting one. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -That was an amazing feeling when they called me and said that you won both Best Picture and the Audience Award. We also went to the Austin Film Festival, Phoenix, Tampa. And the film was selected to tour New Zealand. And then we had a screening in Los Angeles. And distributors came, and there was a very, very terrific guy named Michael Scholl, who also identify, I think, with the film, with a lot of what we were trying to say in the film. And we're very, very lucky that he picked it up for Gallant Entertainment. [APPLAUSE] -Thank you. Thank you for coming to the screening of "10 Attitudes," the film that asked the musical question, can a regular gay guy find love in LA? OK, how many say yes? [LAUGHING] [APPLAUSE] -OK. What do you have to say about "10 Attitudes," son? -It was beautiful. -Totally, totally unprompted. How much was that? -That was 20. -I think it was fantastic. -It was beautiful. -Fantastic is worth more. -Wait, I need a credit card. -Here's our special guest tonight at the "10 Attitudes," live and in person, Doctor Evil. Doctor Evil, what did you think of the film? -(WITH ACCENT) Oh, I thought it was absolutely worth $100 billion, Michael. -Did you say 100-- -Billion. -Billion. -Dollars. -Dollars. -Right. Is that enough? -That's what we should get for this film. -Absolutely. -And Michael goes, just be normal. -Be yourself. -What the hell is normal? -Here's a martini. -Oh, thank you, Dave. -Shh. -The film initially was funded by Rob Bonet, who runs the, uh, Allan Carr production company, Allan Carr's original company, which is now called Envision Entertainment. And Rob really was the first person to be enthusiastic about the film and say, hey, I want to come on board. I want to get into this. I want to help you guys make this real and finance it. The other two executive producers are Lex Dale Owens and Jerry Rosenberg, who are not guys that are in the film business. But they are guys that just love this concept, love the idea of "10 Attitudes." Jerry is from Florida, and Lex is from Texas. So they're, you know, non-Hollywood guys that just have a great, great-- no pun intended-- attitude about things. And they just came to the table and said, hey, we want to be a part of this film. And without Rob and Lex and Jerry, we wouldn't have a film. I mean, it's such an incredible contingent of support for people in Austin, Texas, where our film also sold out at the Gay and Lesbian International Austin Film Festival. And Martin Lukey and Lex Dale Owens and so many people out there were so wonderful to us, you know, and so crazy. I mean, if anybody wants to have a fun time, go to Austin, Texas. -Martin Lukey is our associate producer. Martin is a filmmaker from Austin, Texas. He did a lot of the special editing for the piece. He did the flashback sequence. He did a lot of the main title sequence. And he worked both as a cinematographer and editor on the film, very, very creative guy. Comes out of broadcast news in Texas. And, uh, he just had wonderful creative ideas right along the way. And it was a tremendous help to me throughout the production. MAN (OFFSCREEN): Start. MAN (OFFSCREEN): All you ever do is complain.

So just come over later. -OK. -Good, I'll cook something up. -You're going to cook? -I'll cook something up, but I didn't say that I cook. -You're going to get me fat. Then I have to go on this on this fakakte thing for I don't know how much longer. -Uh-huh. But it's fun. It's like torturing you. -Oh. -Good. -Yeah, you can be the Nazi. I'll be the Jew. Perfect. -We know our parts. -Yes, we do. Oh. -You're late. -Oh. Oh, my god. -Come in. Well, I told you I would cook something up, and I have. But it's not exactly food. So let me set the table. I thought, from how you were talking at the gym, what you really need is to relax. Care for this? -I don't know. I mean, don't you think we should eat first? What's that? -See, look. You need to relax. I've never seen anyone who needs this more than you. -No, I don't. I'm too old to do this. -You're too old for this? -I was really ready to eat, but I-- -Apparently, I'm not going to plan at all about that. -Well, I think we should get to know each other, don't you? I don't that I should-- what do I do? Let me take my keys out. -All right. Shirt. -Oh, I can't take off my shirt. -Oh, come on. Shoes are off. Now it's the shirt. -But-- but-- -Thank you. -Oh, no fair. You have another shirt on underneath. -You don't want to wrinkle it. It's cashmere, you know. -On the table. Down. -OK, great, great. All right. Here we go. -Mm-hmm. Um, would you like me to take these off? -You mean your pants? -Mm-hmm. All right. I've just got to adjust the headrest. -Oh, my god. Um, yeah. Adjust away. [MOANING] Oh, my god. [MOANING] -You know, you can touch too, if you want. -OK. [CHUCKLES] -There we go. -Oh, my god. Oh, my god. MAN (OFFSCREEN): Steve enters here. -Just a second. Just a second.

We just would bounce it off of this. WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): You can do it that way. You can do less, or you can do more. -You know, because if it were me, I'd be beating him over the head with a bat.

Someone's talking to me. -Oh, sorry. I'm a little volatile. -Please stop giving him alcohol. -Open your mouth. Do this. -I don't wanna be gay right now. -You are so not cute. -I was yesterday. Let's take a vote. Who thinks I'm cute? Boys, cute, right? -Yes. -Ta-dah. There you go, baby. I had him. He's fabulous. Could you say, Mildred? Just go, Mildred! 'Cause that was you. Oh, I'm sorry We're all sorry. -Don't worry about it. [LAUGHING] MAN (OFFSCREEN): And cut. And action! -Oh, my god. Here we go. -I'm gonna get up a little. -No, you see, when you have sex, and no sheets come undone, because it's going to get you all hot and sweaty and the body temperature. You know how that goes. Do you want o have it with like a foot right here? MAN (OFFSCREEN): That'd be hysterical. -Do you want to try different positions? MAN (OFFSCREEN): A foot like on his chest? Try it. -You wanna do it this way? MAN (OFFSCREEN): Yeah. -Oh. Oh. Oh. I'm sorry.

But you can have it there. That's good. So that's going to be the start of the shot, going back, going back, going back, going back, going back. -I gotta hold it. -Oh, my god. I don't know if you want-- MAN (OFFSCREEN): That's good. Huh? -You're going to have him like this with his butt spread? MAN (OFFSCREEN): There's nothing wrong with it.

MAN (OFFSCREEN): That's fine.
