(ambient music) (wings flapping) (chiming) (somber music) (woman screaming) - Help! (woman sobbing) Somebody?! Help me! No! Help! Please, somebody help me! (dramatic music) (whimpering) (yelling) Help! Help! Please! (whimpering) (screaming) (dramatic music) ("Paganini Caprice No. 24") (people laughing) (crunching) - Jude! Are you all right? - Yes, Professor. I'm fine. I'm sorry. My E-string broke. - Yes. Indeed. Can we have the lights, please? (ominous music) - I don't know. Maybe I'm just cracking up. (somber music) - Yes, Emily Foster. No one could touch her. I was amazed. Even a bit jealous of her. But she was the only one of my students to ever win the FAC Fellowship. Next day she was gone. - Do you think I'm ready? - Jude, you... you know I... I think you are very talented. Just like Emily. But... Well... What do you want me to say? The FAC tryouts are not like here. We're all friends. You would be in a huge auditorium. A cold empty stage. Bright lights in your eyes. It's all designed to make you feel threatened, intimidated. (ominous music) Of the 200 people that audition, sometimes only two qualify. - Professor, I'm gonna work just so much harder than any other student you have. - Jude. (sighing) Jude, do you remember what I told you? - Yeah. - Mm-hm? - The tension between order and chaos. Precision and passion. - Yes, precision is essential. The two together will guide you to what you seek. Precision by itself is cold. It has no feeling. Passion by itself is... chaos. Emily understood. She achieved the two. At a terrible cost. (ominous music) - [Ben] So which one are you supposed to be? The soulless one or the... what's the other one? - Chaotic. I don't know, both. Because then I'm gifted. I don't know. I think he just wants to mess with my head or get into my pants. Or both. - Well, if we're talking about getting into your pants, I, for one, would very much like to do that. - [Jude] Really? - [Ben] Yes, yeah. (laughing) - Okay, later. - Is that Ben? Hi, Ben. Jude's sleeping around. She had sex with Mr. Murphy. - [Jude] Ah, no. - Jude doesn't treat you right you know I'm available, okay? - I can mistreat Ben all I want, thank you. - [Sarah] Uh-huh. - [Jude] Okay, I'm gonna go. - [Ben] Okay. - [Jude] All right, I love you. - [Ben] Love you too. - [Sarah] I love you too, Ben. Call me. (laughing) - All right. Love you, Jude and Sarah. And hi, Veronica. - [Jude] Okay, I'll talk to you later. - Hey, Ben! - Okay, bye. Muah. - What's up? - Hey, what's up? - My ladies. - Hey. - [Sarah] Hey. - Great news, my babies. I have finally sublet that upstairs room. - No way, that's great. - Yeah? What's he like? Better than you? - Stop, Sarah. We both know that's impossible. - I just hope he's not crazy like that last guy. - Yeah. - Oh my God, that dude sucked. - (Sarah laughing) Fucking nightmare. Yeah, this dude's pretty cool, though. He plays the guitar. - Oh, that's so boring. We want someone interesting and exotic. - I want uncircumcised. - [Jude] Sarah. - He's British. That's all I really know. Oh, homeboy thinks he knows movies. - Oh, really? - [Steve] We'll see about that. - [Veronica] Bon appétit. - Ah, fava beans and a good Chianti? - Okay, no Hannibal. Ravioli. - Hey, Steve's new roommate is British. - British? - Does he go to the Conservatory? - [Steve] I didn't check. Hey, my beautiful mamacitas, how long do I have to sit here before you offer me some of this food? - What do you bring to the party, Steve? - You mean besides this perfect personality and hair? - [Veronica] Yeah, besides the personality and the hair, what do you bring? - Weed. - Oh. - [Veronica] Right. - Go get a plate. (laughing) (photo snapping) - [Ben] Okay, um... I want you. I'm feeling your breasts. I want to be inside of you. - [Jude] Ben! (Jude laughing) - [Ben] What? What? - You can't just start at the end. You have to ease into it with some foreplay. - Oh, okay. - Yeah, I want to do it. - [Ben] You want to... - Mm-hm. - Okay, you wanna do it? - Mm-hm. Are you touching yourself? - Yeah. - Good. So I'm touching you and kissing you. - Where are you kissing me? - Mmm, your neck. - [Ben] Cool. - And I'm running my fingers down your body. Kissing your chest. - What else? - I miss you. - I miss you too. This feels really nice. Keep going. (giggling) - I'm moving down. Touching you. Feeling you. Feeling how hard you are. - Very, very hard. - And I move my lips lower. - Yeah? - And lower. - How low? - And then I finally move my lips just-- (ominous music) Shit! - Keep going. - Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! - [Ben] Jude? - [Jude] Shit! - [Ben] What-what, Jude? Hello? Hello? Did I lose you? Hello? - I'll call you back in a little bit, okay? - [Ben] Is everything okay? What happened? Jude? (Skype closing tone) (ominous music) (fast violin music) - Last week of rehearsal. Right? Okay, again. From the top. First variation. And remember, you came here because we're one of the best, so... Perfection. (Paganini's Caprice No. 24) (ominous music) (Murphy sighing) - [Tommy] I want my fucking money, you stupid piece of shit! - Give me a fucking break, Tommy. I'll give you the money. - [Tommy] When? I want it fucking now! - A couple more days. I can't be the first. Let it go, man. - Fuck you! - Hey! (intense music) Leave him alone! Get off! - No, no, no! Jude, come on! Let's go! - [Jude] Off! - Jude, let's go! - That crazy bitch broke my nose! (tires screeching) (ominous music) - What was that about? - Nothing. - Are you gonna call the police? - No, I'm not gonna call the police. - Why? - Because, Jude, you know what I do. Okay, that guy's an investor. So he fronts me. And I was short this week so we had a failure to communicate. And then I called his mom a cunt. - What? I would've hit you too. - That's me. The guy people hit. How was rehearsal? - It was great. It was good. - Cool. - Hey, you remember Emily Foster, from the Conservatory, right? - Yeah, the girl who was pushed off the roof. - No, I heard she committed suicide. - I don't know. Someone told me she was pushed. Why? - They said she was so good that she went crazy. I don't know. - Jude, if you ever need... If you ever need anything. Like... - Thanks. - Speaking of your girl, Emily, I heard they never found her violin. Aren't those like a hundred thousand dollars? - Yeah, some are. Mine isn't. (upbeat music) - [Steve] I'm moving all over the place. I fought like Jiu Jitsu, and I'm defending myself. He's trying to stomp me out. And all of a sudden I hear these tiny, little footsteps sprinting towards me. And she woof, woof, just starts going crazy. He's like, spinning backwards. - Jude? Jude? Earth to Jude. Come here. Come here. - Hey, guys. - Hey. (Steve groaning) - Whoa, is that dinner on your face? Come on, get up. - He's thawing them out for us. - At least it's not dinner on his dick. (laughing) - Hey, I ordered pizza. - Oh, thank you. Long day. - [Steve] What is this? "A center for ants?" - What? - [Steve] Zoolander. - [Sarah] Zoolander. - Oh, whatever. Anyways, guys, this is months in the making. Look at it. - Whoa. - Look at the detail. - Yeah. - So what happened to you? - Oh, Jude saved Steve from a drug deal gone bad. - [Steve] Well, it wasn't a drug-- - [Sarah] Whatever. Jude kicked ass. - [Veronica] Steve, where's the roommate? - Oh, you know, busy eating crumpets and shit. Can't come over. - Did you invite him? - No. - Wow. - I'm keeping all of you to myself. - Ew. - Keep yourself to yourself. Steve, what are you doing? - What are you doing? Are you serious? - I said months in the making, come on. - You threw peas at me right now? - I just told you I've been working hard on this. - Come on, man. You guys are supposed be my friends. Yo, I'm out of here. I need to water my plants anyway. - You are so annoying. - Wow, cool. Some friends. Thanks, guys. (laughing) - [Sarah] Bye. - [Veronica] He literally broke it. He broke it, look. - Oh, fuck. - So annoying. - Bye. - [Veronica] Oh. Anyways, um, what really happened today? - It was nothing. - [Veronica] Nothing? Okay. - I got a little wound up after rehearsal. - Must've been wound pretty tight. (laughing) - Do you guys remember Emily Foster? - [Sarah] Yeah. The crazy violinist who jumped off the roof? - [Veronica] Sarah! - [Sarah] What? Okay, the crazy violinist that fell off the roof. - You know what, you are so horrible. - Come on! (laughing) Is that seriously what's been bothering you? - I saw a memorial poster today. Just kind freaked me out. - Some people are just plain crazy. - Steve said she got pushed. - Trustworthy source. - [Jude] It's a lot of pressure. She was really driven. She was a really, really really great violinist. - Yeah and you're really good. You're a great violin player. So stop scaring yourself with these stories. - Yeah, look, if you let what happened to Emily get to you, then you actually will go crazy. - What I'm saying is it's a lot to handle that kind of genius. A lot of strength. Skill. A lot. Talent's a really dangerous drug. - It is. Right, come on, Jude. Stop obsessing. You're gonna be great. - Mr. Murphy doesn't seem to think so. - Oh, fuck him. You're a winner, okay. Babe, you gotta loosen up. You're too tense. - Tension is the opposite of slack. - Yeah? I told you I'd get you your money. No. (ominous music) She's my friend, I'm not doing that. Don't touch her. (violin scraping) - Hey, loser! Oh! It's you! Here we go. (eerie music) How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice! Practice! Practice! Loser! You suck! You fucking suck! You stupid bitch! (menacing music) (screaming) (somber music) - What are you afraid of? - I just-- - You have been anxious. You've been distracted. Now, either you have done the work of the last four years or you haven't. - No, I'm fully committed. - Are you? Have you been? - Do you think Emily was pushed? Or do you think she just went crazy? Like the police said. - Jude, find your focus. Talking about Emily will not help. - No, I will. I'm trying. - Sometimes trying is just not enough. We have spent a lot of time together and I want to see it count for something. (ominous music) (sighing) - [Jude] No, but that's my point. That's the difference between fiction and real life. The fiction has to be logical. - Well, David Lynch makes complete sense. It's just the logic of a dream. (eerie music) - Give me a break. Go. - "Do I make you horny, baby?" - [Jude] Seriously, no, you don't. It's too easy, Steve. - [Veronica] And too pushy, Steve. - Let's think here. - "Zampano is here." - [Veronica] Zampano is here? (menacing music) (crashing) (dog barking) - Whoa! - I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, guys. - "Ah. Good evening, Mr. Torrance. "Your regular?" - The Shining. Too easy, Steve. - Everyone, this is my shiny new roommate, Dave. - Oh, hey, Dave. - [Steve] This is Veronica. - Wait, what happened to "Zampano is here?" - Oh, you guys are playing the movie game that Steve told me about. - Yeah. - And this is Dave's monster dog, Taliban. - [Sarah] Aw. - It's not Taliban. It's Caliban from The Tempest? (laughing) - That makes sense. - That's Shakespeare, Steve. - Oh, thank you, Veronica. - You're welcome. - And he's not as ferocious as he seems. - Wait, wait, wait. Steve, I'm sorry. So you're roommate was home and you came over for dinner? - Oh. - It's fine, I already ate. - [Veronica] Here, here. Take a seat. - Okay, just never mind that. Can you say British things like, "easy peasy" or um, "can I get into your knickers?" - [Steve] Say, uh, say "bollocks." Say, "Bob's your uncle." - "Bob's your uncle." - Is that what you guys say? Bob? - Yeah, we say that. Yeah. I've got one. "Bugger off." - That's pretty sexy. - The hot girl with no fashion sense, that's Sarah. - [Sarah] Bonjour. - She's kind of like Mata Hari, so... - Hi, Sarah. - Hi. What the hell's Mata Hari? - Greta Garbo. - Spy. - [Steve] Exactly. - [Jude] 1931. - 1931. Um-hm. And this is-- - Jude. Pleased to meet you, Jude. And also, La Strada. - Huh? - [Sarah] What? - Right. - "Zampano is here." La Strada. It's from the movie, La Strada. (laughing) - Steve, I'm sorry, you said he thinks he knows movies. - He's okay, I guess. - And I have one. - [Jude] Okay. - A line. - [Jude] Uh-huh. - "You are all my children now." - Oh, um. - [Veronica] Sarah, come on. (groaning) Sarah, come on, we know this. Think-think-think-think. - Freddy Krueger. - She's got it. Jude nailed it. - Nightmare on Elm Street Two. - [Dave] Bingo! - She got it! She got it! (cheering) - Shit. - [Steve] Jude gets it. She wins. - Well, on that note, I think that calls for a cheers. - Thank you. Cheers. - Cheers, Jude. - I win. - Yeah, she does. (laughing) (thudding) (whooshing) - Sarah! - Jude, you're done with your laundry, right? - Yeah, almost. It's in the dryer. But just almost done. - Okay. You know we have to stay on schedule if-- - So Sarah's upstairs. - Yeah. - Yeah, she keeps dropping her garbage down the laundry chute. - I know, I keep telling her. It's not my job to keep up with other people's laundry and garbage in this house. - Okay. It's fine. - I'm just saying. - Sarah? (glass shattering) - Oh! Hey, what's up? - So this is? This is art? - Yeah, it's raw material for my lover. Do you like him? I was thinking about doing a ménage à trois. Or do you think that's too ambitious? - No, not for you. - You wanna try? It's so therapeutic. Go on, you've been working so hard. You gotta let it out. - I'm good. - Yeah? - But, uh, be careful. Don't hurt yourself. - I'm using protection. As always. - Okay. And don't drop your garbage down the laundry chute anymore. - Yes, ma'am. - Thank you. (ominous music) (wind blowing) (foreboding music) (menacing music) - [Jude] Do you ever get the feeling like someone's, like, watching you? - Not really. - Yeah, I just... I've been having this weird feeling lately like someone's watching me and following me and messing with my stuff. - I'd like to mess with your stuff. Sorry. (giggling) I don't know, could it be one of the girls? Could they be going through your underwear drawer? Maybe Sarah? I can totally picture Sarah in your underwear. - Oh, really? - And not looking anywhere near as attractive as you. Or sexy. Or talented. Intelligent or understanding. Sexy? Did I mention sexy? Really, you're sexy. - Yeah, you're not so bad yourself. You've got a really good head on your shoulders. - Well, the rest of me's not so bad either. - Yeah. When am I seeing you? (distant train horn) - Um, yeah, um... Not this week. 'Cause I gotta work nights and double shifts because finals are coming up. - Um-hm. - You know how it is. - Yeah, I know. I'm pulling late rehearsals too so it's okay. - But, uh,... I miss you. - I miss you. - And, uh, I love you. - Love you too. Talk to you later. - [Sarah] Hi, sexy! - Hi, you're home late. I thought you were upstairs. - It's late? - Yeah. - Oh. I'm gonna go back out. - No! No! No! You can't. Don't go back out. - So it's early when I come back. - Come back to me. Let's go. - Oh, I did the dance. - No. You've had a little too much to drink. (giggling) - You should come out with me. You're working too hard. - Yeah, well try-outs first and then fun. - See? There's always an excuse. How is your love life on that tiny screen satisfying? I don't get it. - You scare me, Sarah. - Why? Just open up! God! You have sex and then you get in touch with your body. Then you do better art. I mean, seriously. Ben is adorable. Why aren't you having sex with him yet? - Okay. Hear me out. Veronica just made brownies. I think we should have two, not tell her. - Okay. - And see if she notices. - Okay! (violin music) (intense violin scratching) (string breaking) (eerie music) (screaming) (ominous music) (gasping) (somber guitar music) (Jude humming) (distant train horn) (guitar strumming) - That was terrible and that was not what I was playing. - What were you playing? - Paganini's Caprice Number 24. - Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (somber strumming) - No. No. No. Sorry. - I'll get there. - Hey, were you watching me last night? Well? - That's really weird. Last night, Cal was barking and he woke me up and I had the strangest feeling that I was being watched. But I looked out the window, I didn't see anyone. I thought it must be my imagination, but now I'm thinking I was wrong, Jude, because how would you know I was looking out my window unless I was actually being watched by you? - What? No, I was just, I thought, I was looking... - Have you been spying on me? - No, I... You know what, this little British thing it's not gonna work on me. - Oh, really? That's a shame. Usually it works. Been listening to you play music. - Really? What do you think? - It's good. Not quite there yet, though. - Oh. So just pretty good? I happen to be very good. - But are you excellent? - Yeah, I think so. - Good. (strumming) - Your A-string's out of tune. - I knew that. - [Jude] Um-hm. - Ta-ta, Jude. - Hey. - [Jude] Hey. (somber strumming) - [Veronica] You're home early. - Yeah. Murphy had some kind of faculty thing so he let me go early. (ominous music) - [Veronica] Well, was it at least better today? - Yeah. It was good. - That's nice. - [Jude] Ben? Ben? - [Veronica] What? This is Ben's jacket. - Maybe in your room? Whoa, okay. I thought he wasn't coming today. - Ben? - [Veronica] Think he'll stay for dinner? (Sarah sexually moaning) (Sarah and Ben giggling) - [Ben] You said you wanted to do it though. (Sarah shushing) (Sarah moaning) - [Sarah] Oh my God. That feels so good. Oh, that's so good. (Sarah moaning) (dramatic music) - [Ben] Oh my God! (laughing) - [Sarah] Stop! (Sarah moaning) (glass shattering) (Sarah screaming) - [Jude] Sarah, get out! - [Ben] Shit! - Get out! - It didn't mean anything. - Go, Sarah! Go, Sarah! You fucking bitch! - I'm not a bitch! - [Ben] This isn't what it seems like. - I hate that word. - Can you fucking hear yourself? You're definitely a bitch! - [Ben] Please! It was nothing. - [Jude] Ben, get out! - Jude, listen-- - Stop, Ben. Leave! - I wanted to surprise you. - I'm sorry, you wanted to surprise me? I wasn't even gonna be here. - Jude. Jude, come on, don't do this. - Don't talk to me, Ben. - Come on, don't do this! - [Veronica] What the hell's going on? - Jude! (ominous music) Jude, come on, hear me out. This isn't what it seems like, okay? We weren't, it wasn't, we didn't mean to... Come on, will you open the door, please? Can we talk about this? (knocking) Jude, come on. What do you want me to say? If you had just been there... - I just want you gone. (foreboding music) - Hey, can I join you? - Sure. - Need a drink. - Where's Sarah? - Oh, she went out. Told her to give you some space. - Thank you. - Mm-hm. Where's the boyfriend? - He's gone. He's dead to me now. - Screw him. What are you doing? What is this? I don't even like this picture. Here, take this. This is... This is the most important time of your life. You know that, right? You can't let this get to you. This Sarah shit. This boyfriend bullshit. This Murphy stuff messing with your head. You don't have time for that. - Yeah. - You know you need to stay focused, okay? You know what you want. - Yeah, you're right. You're right. - And, um... Look, I think you need to delete these pictures. - No, come on. - We do. We do. I'll be the first. Look. Delete. That was easy. Your turn. Come on. - Delete. - One more. - Delete. - Delicious. Now let's just take a shot. Do it. - I don't want to do it. Move. Move. - Come on. - Move over. - Delete them. - All right. Delete. - Yep. I hate that one. Come on. (laughing) - Delete. - [Veronica] Delete. - Delete. You do it. - Don't mind if I do. - Delete. - Bye, bye, Ben. - Delete. Delete. Delete. (somber music) (water trickling) (humming) (doorbell ringing) - Hello? Can somebody get that? (doorbell ringing) Hello? Is anybody home? (doorbell ringing) (knocking on door) What? Hello? - Sorry. - [Jude] Hey. - We all go a little mad sometimes. - What? - With the knocking, if I did it too much. We all go a little mad sometimes. The line from the movie, The Game. - Oh, yeah. We all go a little mad. - Me being crazy. - Yeah, I'm not really in the mood for that right now. Sorry. - Okay, well I came over because Steve and I wanted to know if you and the girls want to join us for dinner tonight. - Thanks. I can't make it but I'll let Veronica know. - Okay, cool. - Okay, bye. - How about-- How about this? You and I spend some time together. - Uhh... I'm just really busy right now. - Okay. Message received. Loud and clear. - Okay. - See you later. - Bye. Hey! Psycho. - What? - Psycho. It's the line from the movie. - Correct. Very impressive, Jude. (distant train horn) So, um, dinner tomorrow night? - We'll see. - We'll see? (somber music) - What? You just ignore the door? - I was working. - Working. Working. Yeah, you're the only one to have work to do, Sarah. - Was it important? Dave? He is cute. (eerie music) (wind howling) (distant train horn) (ominous music) - Hey. - Hey. A big storm is coming tomorrow. Storm shutters. - Katrina big? - They didn't predict that one correctly, so let's just get ready. - How long's it supposed to last? I have my try-out coming up. - I don't know. - All done? - [Veronica] Yeah. - All right, I'm gonna go upstairs. - Hey, wait. Anything new? Talked to Sarah? - Seriously? - Well, you two need to work things out. - Why? - Because we live together. - She slept with my boyfriend. I'm the one who's supposed to make things nice? - Look, she can't help it. She's a very open person. - You mean, a complete slut. - Jude, she's comfortable with who she is. And it wasn't only her fault. - Are you serious? Why are you defending her? Whose side are you on? Are you on her side or are you on my side? - Look, this is just like that order and chaos thing you're talking about. Right? You need to pull it together. It's time to get a hold of your mess. - Fine. (eerie music) (phone alarm) (romantic violin music) (wind blowing) (somber guitar music) (somber violin music) (somber guitar music) (somber violin music) - Wow. That was really good, Jude. You're talented. So you wanna go for a drink downstairs at the bar? - Steve's? - Yeah. - It's kind of a dive. - Well, I hear that the bartender's very talented. - Oh. Okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. - See you downstairs. - Hey, Jude. - Oh, Steve, hey. Sorry, I was, I'm gonna-- - Something wrong? - No. No, yeah, I'm good. - Jude, Jude, hi. Uh, is there a guest list? (chuckling) - You guys talking about classes? - Uh, surely you can't be serious. - I am serious. Don't call me Shirley. - Yeah. - Airplane. Nice one. - Yep. - So, what are you having? - The usual. - Which is what? - Martini. - "Shaken, not stirred." - "Stirred, not shaken." - If it is a martini, you're not allowed to look where I get the olives from 'cause it is disgusting. - Oh, okay. - Okay? - So romantic. - That's me. Okay, I grab a couple of these bad boys. There's at least seven types of bacteria in this fridge. I've named each one of them. Okay. - Okay? - You can look now. Damage is done. Okay, and then I... How do I do this again? Don't knock it until you try it. I know it looks gross. Hang on. - Creative. (sloshing) - It goes everywhere every time. Maybe you should've done that. - I think I'm gonna stick to music. But thank you. (somber radio music) - Um so, how long have you been playing music? - I've been holding a violin for as long as I can remember. - So the violin is older than you are. - It's 103, yeah. It's a Gagliano. Great grandmother's. - Wow. I've heard of Battista, are they similar? - They both have strings. - Okay, right. I don't think this will kill you, but give it a go. - Okay. - And it's good to see you again, Jude. - Yeah. - Cheers. - Cheers. (thudding) - Hi, Cal! - Hey, bud, get down. Come on. - Hi! - Jeez, you know how to steal a man's thunder, don't you, boy? - You gotta be careful. I'm on a rebound. - Yeah, I heard about that. I'm sorry. - Yeah. You know, when you find your best friend in bed with your boyfriend, it's uh... Sorry. First date, you're not supposed to talk about exes. - So this is a date. Okay. Thought it was just a drink but... - What about you? You're new in town. Did you leave anyone behind? - Um... Look, I-- We just met. I didn't want to make this weird or anything. - I'm not taken. I mean, I was seeing someone and... I'm not anymore. - Did you dump her or did she dump you or was it some, like, mutual thing? - Actually, she... Sorry. She died. - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. You wanted to know. It's fine. - Hi, Steve. - Hey. I was reading something. You know, they say that we're the last generation to enjoy sex. - Who? Who's they? A scientist. - Oh. - Apparently it's a reaction to over-population, so... Pretty soon, sex drive's just going to disappear. No more pleasure. No more sex. No more people. - All right. Well, yeah. Quite the optimist, Steve, aren't you? - Well, I mean, I know mine still works. What about yours? - I gotta go. I have rehearsal. Yeah, but um... Thank you. Delightful. (chuckling) Okay, yeah. I'll see you. - Yeah. - [Jude] Bye. - Bye. Oh, Jude. (wind rushing) Jude! Hey. Keep warm. - Oh. Thank you. - And, um, yeah. See you later. (train horn) (phone chime) (intense violin music) (knocking) - [Sarah] Jude! Please! We really need a break! (Sarah groaning) For fuck's sack, Jude! (Sarah pounding) Can't you play something different? Great! (wind howling) (slow rising scale) God, you make me want to kill you! (foreboding music) (thunder) (somber music) - What? What? What? What? What? - Jude, I need to talk to you. - What? What's up? - It's about Dave. - Stop, I'm a big girl, okay? I don't need-- - What? Listen to me. He's not who you think he is at all. He's some kind of stalker. - Seriously? A stalker? - I'm serious, Jude. I was up-- - Steve. - Hey. - Hi. Lunch is ready. - You don't mind if I join, right? - I thought it was gonna be just us two, actually. - Oh, well I wouldn't want to intrude. (eerie music) - Why not? Please, take a seat. The more the merrier. (ominous music) (thunder) (thunder rumbling) (rain splashing) (television weather alarm beeping) - [TV Announcer] The following message is transmitted at the request of the Louisiana State Police Department. Civil authorities have issued a warning from Baton Rouge to Saint Francisville vicinity. Travel on interstate highways and all river roads is suspended due to local flooding on inland and coastal roads. Stay tuned for further details as they follow. - Well, looks like we're not going anywhere. Not until the rains stops anyway. Reminds me of London. - Yeah, as long as the roads are clear by morning. (thunder) Steve? You okay? - Yeah. Great. You see, I came to a terrible discovery. (eerie music) You can be desperately in love with someone you despise. - Day For Night. (ominous music) - Hey. Guys, seriously. What's up? - Don't ask me, Jude. - Okay, Steve? - Love means never having to say you're sorry. Or does it? (foreboding music) So you two hooking up now or what? So I'VE drank all of your wine and ate all of this delicious food. It's only right I, myself, add something to this beautiful festivity. Shall we retire to my garden? Mate? - No. No. - You know what? Why not? (ominous music) (lights buzzing) (thunder) - Do you think I'm funny? Funny like a clown? I'm here to amuse you? - Goodfellas. - Here's the thing, Jude. I just wanna know how well you two really know each other. No, I know you know her. How well do you know him? - If you've got something to say, please, by all means, Steve. - Why don't you ask him what classes he's taking this summer? That is why you're here, isn't it, Dave? (thunder) "You shall not pass." - I mean I thought he would be taking guitar, right? - No, I'm not actually, Jude. - Yeah, Jude, he's not taking any classes this summer. I checked. Ask him yourself if you don't believe me. - Okay. Dave. - Hey, maybe I'm just a bit paranoid because of what I do for a living. - Steve? - There was always something about you. A little too perfect. Like the handsome English dude in the movies that always ends up being the killer. - Really? See, I always thought it was the comic relief that turned out to be the killer. Isn't that you, Steve? (thunder) - You wanna know what I found out? - You know what, okay. I'm gonna go out into the storm because it might be a little less tense. - Goddamn it, Jude, that's what I was telling you outside. He's been taking pictures of you. He's stalking you. - What are you gonna show her, mate? Pictures? Pictures that you could've taken? You could've planted. I'm the stalker. I just got here, Steve. How long have you been pining after Jude? I've seen the way you look at her, that pathetic puppy-dog look in your eyes. I'm telling you, Steve, you do not know what you're getting yourself into. This ends right now. You understand? Good. Come on, Jude. Jude? All right, whatever. - What? What is going on? - Why don't you believe me? Jude, why don't you ever listen to me? I'm not some fucking joke. - I know, Steve, I know. - I mean, since I've known you I've been the only guy who's been there for you. The only one who has cared for you and you just string me along, while you go from one guy who treats you like shit to this guy who is literally like Jack-the-fucking-Ripper. - Stop, Steve. Stop! I don't need to hear that. Whatever problem you're having with Dave-- - Problem I'm having with Dave? You think this is my problem? Go in his room right now and see what he's hiding. You'll know whose fucking problem this is. (thundering) Does every woman I meet have to be a fucking whore? Or can you not handle the truth? (smack) (menacing music) (unsettling music) - Steve? Steve, Dave knew Emily. He did it! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe, Steve. Steve! Steve! Steve?! (dog snarling) (barking) (growling) (intense music) (barking) - Jude, I need to talk to you. (menacing music) (thud) - Monster! - Jude! (thunder rumbling) (intense music) - Veronica! (groaning) Veronica! Veronica! (thudding) (doorbell) (whimpering) (unsettling music) (banging on door) - [Dave] Can we talk? - What do you want? - [Dave] What I've wanted since we met. Oh, Jude, there's just something about you that gets me crazy. - I don't know what you're talking about. - [Dave] It's a shame. I had a feeling that you were perfect. But alas, you're not. - What? - [Dave] What am I gonna do with you now, Jude? (Dave sighing) Will you open the door, Jude? (door handle rattling) Jude? Please open the door. (thudding) (intense music) (windows banging) (ominous music) (glass shattering) (intense music) Sarah?! (eerie music) (Jude crying) (Jude whimpering) Oh, my God. (rain pouring) (banging) - Jude! (intense music) (yelling) Jude! (Dave yelling) (splashing) (exciting music) (exciting music) (exciting music) (whoosh) (thudding) (thudding) - Veronica? Veronica? Wake up! (sobbing) (footsteps) (ominous music) (footsteps) (footsteps) (footsteps) (footsteps) - Here's Davey. (Jude screaming) (total silence) (ominous music) (ominous music) (ominous music) Power went out some time ago. - Steve was right. Why are you stalking me? - I'm not stalking you, Jude. What a rude thing to say. I've been fascinated by you. Watching you. Listening to you struggle with your music. What a disappointment you are. You're good. You're not great. Emily was great. And this beautiful instrument of yours I fear might be a little bit much for you. I think it deserves to be in a pair of better hands. But that'll leave me with a problem. What to do with you. (eerie music) - What do you mean? Please. Just put it back, please. Put it back. - It's a very valuable instrument, isn't it? - Yeah. Yes. - Do you know how to determine the value of a violin? Well, I'll tell you. There are a few things to look out for. One, it's the detail of the scroll. You see? The other, is how refined the edges are. But most importantly, Jude, the graduation of the wood at the back. But this isn't the original bow though, it is? No. Because the maker's mark would be here if it was. But on the violin, the original maker's sticker would be inside the violin and you'd have to look through the sounding hole to see it. (foreboding music) I can't make it out in this light. You said this is a Gagliano. - Yeah, it's my Gagliano. Remember? It was my great grandmother's. - Yeah, it's the Gagliano. You said it was a hundred and... - Three. (ominous music) - That's old, isn't it? (crying) Trying to find the maker's sticker. Here you go. Now we're talking. Found the sticker. Wait. What? No, this isn't right. What? This isn't supposed to happen. Wait. This can't happen. This is supposed to be a Battista. (intense music) (screaming) - Die! Fucking die! (Dave groaning) Fucking die! Please die. (Jude crying) (Jude crying) (ominous music) (ominous music) (ominous music) (ominous music) (ominous music) (ominous music) (ominous music) (ominous music) (ominous music) (ominous music) (ominous music) (ominous music) (ominous music) (ominous music) (ominous music) (ominous music) (train horn) (intense music) (intense music) - [Ben] We good to go? - Steve was my-- - I know. I'm sorry. - I'm still mad at you. - [Ben] I'm sorry about that too. - [Ben] I'm sorry about that too. - [Ben] I'm sorry about that too. (police sirens) - [911 Dispatcher] 911, what's your emergency? - [Dave] There's blood all over the place. My roommate's been stabbed. - [911 Dispatcher] Can you give me your address? - [Dave ] My house, 613 Bank Street. Send someone now. Hurry up, please! - [911 Dispatcher] Most of the roads are still unpassable but we'll send police and ambulance as soon as we can. Is anyone with you? - [Dave] My neighbor, Jude Hunter. She just ran out. Maybe to her house next door. - [911 Dispatcher] Okay, sir, stay where you are. (dog whimpering) - Detective. Found this little guy alive upstairs. - Great. Book him. - Come on, boy. (train horn) - Excuse me. Detectives, I'm Professor Murphy from the university. - Tell us what you know about this. - All I know is that the woman that lives in this house is a student of mine and I came over because she left me this frantic voicemail and I came as quickly as I could. She kept on, she kept on-- - Slow down. Settle down. - She kept on repeating that she was on her way, that she wouldn't be late for our FAC Fellowship try-outs. - Where are those? - They're at the university. But they aren't for another three months. And she... She didn't even qualify. (eerie music) (gasp) (tires screeching) - We need to get her back here. - Right. - We need to ask you some questions. - Yes, of course, anything. - [Detective] Was Emily Foster a student of yours as well? - [Murphy] What does Emily have to do with this? - [Detective] There may be a connection. - [Murphy] Emily and Jude were both students of mine. - [Detective] One of the victims appears to have been Emily's boyfriend. - [Murphy] Oh my God, that would be David. He was a grad student. When she died, he was convinced somebody had killed her. - [Detective] And you believe that your student, Jude, was involved? - [Murphy] That's what people say. David was convinced she was. (intense music) (car horn) - Does every woman I meet have to be a fucking whore? - You need to pull it together. It's time to get a hold of your mess. (groaning) - Dave. He's cute. - Ben. - If you had just been there. - [Ben] Are you excited? - Yes. Yes. I'm so happy you're here. - I wouldn't miss it. Hey. You're the gifted one. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) I believe in you. I've always believed in you. You're perfect. (police sirens) - [Police Announcer] Step out of the car put your hands on your head! - [Murphy] Honored judges and guests, presenting Jude Hunter from the Baton Rouge Conservatory, auditioning with Paganini's Caprice Number 24. (train crossing bells) (dramatic music) (exciting music) (train crossing bells) (train crossing bells) (train horn) - [Murphy] And the winner of this year's FAC competition Miss Jude Hunter. (train horn) - [Ben] Jude? They're waiting for you. (train horn) (car engine revving) (train horn) (train horn) (crash) (somber violin music) (somber violin music) (somber violin music) (somber violin music) (somber violin music) (somber violin music) (somber violin music) (somber violin music) (somber violin music) (somber violin music) (music box chiming) (dramatic music)
