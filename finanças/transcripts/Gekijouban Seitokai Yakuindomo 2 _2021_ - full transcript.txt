So I finally started making progress, but like... Morning! Sorry to keep you. Let's go! ...and we totally copied each other. Good morning! Good morning! My boyfriend and I celebrated his birthday recently. Oh? What'd you do? I baked him a cake! Awesome! I'm begging you! I thought it was a crab, but it turned out to be a shrimp. Shrimp, huh? Which do you prefer, the big kind or the small kind? The ones with eggs in 'em. We made it in time. What a relief. Oh. A cherry blossom petal. They say having one with your tea is good luck. I wonder if something nice will happen. We did something nice! Ousai Academy Student Council Rules! Article Two, Section 24! This meal originated in Western Japan, the "going commando" hot pot! In this world, there is some knowledge that need not be shared. Most awesome legendary days! Most awesome legendary days! Getsuyou asa kara iza yuke gakuen Days Monday morning, get up, off to school Daiteki na no wa gogo ichi akubi houkago banzai Careful with that afternoon yawn, school's out, boo-yah Koku suu ei ri sha nante mondai nai kedo I can handle all the classes just fine Ren'ai keiken heikin ika But I'm still less experienced than most people Datte kousoku kinshi da shi I mean, it's against the school rules Ashita wa Get You nanchatte I'll get you tomorrow!

Yoroshiku ne Nice to meet you A good education, nobility, and purity! That's when I started feeling hungry and... Hey, what's going on between you and Tone-kun recently? T-T-T-Tone?! Sorry to trouble you, Tsuda-kun. No worries, it's my duty as Student Council staff. Okay, just leave that one over here. Sure. The rest is up to you. Don't worry about locking up. Okay. That was one of our cheap pieces, don't worry about it. I'm so sorry... There should be some glue in the prep room, so use that to fix it. Bye. Right. Did something break? Oh my gosh, you're bleeding! Uh, it's actually just some glue. It got stuck on my hand. Huh? Is this it, Shino-chan? No, this is the prep room. The art teacher never keeps things straight... We have to hurry and fool them! Huh? Why are you two arm wrestling? ...and that's what happened. Oh dear. We could get you unstuck with some hot water, but... The all council meeting is about to start, so there's no time. As head of the Public Morals committee, being seen holding hands with a boy would end me... Ahh! I can already see the judging whites of their eyes! This kind of white eyes is quite cute though. Thanks for toning them down! The issue of noise coming from the brass band and music clubs was solved by closing the windows. That's all from the culture club committee. Oops. Legally speaking, you're totally in the clear to put your right hand on your crotch now... I'll just use my left, thanks! Okay, next is an update from the athletic club committee. We have reports of problems due to excess bird poop on the ground during practice. That's annoying. What if we installed bird repellent balloons? I like that idea! All right, let's start making them right away! Yeah! I gotta get to the bathroom to wash this off! Oh? That sounds simply dreadful. Don't look so smug! Grrrr Shino-chan. You've got the balloon in your mouth backwards. You must have a lot of pent up frustration to pretend you're prepping a condom. Don't jump to conclusions! Good thing it's all over now, huh? Yeah, I suppose. The hot water is almost ready. Sorry to put you through such a terrible experience. W-well, I wouldn't call it "terrible"... Annnnd drop of hot water. Hot, hot, hot, I'm dead! I got a C for practical skill in home economics... I'm just so bad at doing chores and stuff. Then work on gaining more experience. Okay! I'll farm some experience points here. And without further ado... The manager we've all been waiting for, Tsuda Kotomi-san! Happy to be here! Your jobs will include: cleaning the Dojo and washing our uniforms. Basic stuff! And gathering info on our rival schools. Spy stuff! By the way, what's Takatoshi-kun's favorite food? Our captain is trying to dig up personal info. I hope Kotomi is doing a good job... Want to go take a look? Hey Kotomi, working hard? My back is killing me... Oh boy. Here, I'll lend you my vacuum cleaner. Why do you have that with you? I was curious how it might be used to masturbate. In any case, the school rules are definitely violated! Ahem, in regards to the recent team competition, Mitsuba won the first round fair and square... All right, let's begin! Okay! Crap. Can you fix the part that's frayed? I'll give it a shot. I have some thread with me anyway. You came prepared. I'm a master of garrote, after all. Forget it, I'll sew it. The captain excels at grappling techniques. So cool! I wish I could do that, too. Then let me teach you. This is the rear naked choke. That's just a hug from behind... Okay, that's enough for today! Thank you for the lesson! I'm pooped! Time for a shower. Be sure to wash everything. Right! I feel good as new! Where are my panties? What? It's extra chilly now. I'm so sorry... That's okay. Admitting that you screwed up without making excuses is admirable. Keep working at it. Right! Did something happen with you ladies? You're looking fidgety. Well, all of our panties got wet. Huh?! At least come up with a decent excuse! Oh, we're doing this again. It hasn't come up in a while, so I thought we were done with it. Okay, let's get on with it. All right. It's nice to see you two being so enthusiastic! We just want it to end quickly! Boo, you're such spoilsports. Here we go! This one is surprisingly banal. Let's come up with a safe answer, for the sake of the show... Uh, clouds. I wonder... smoke, maybe? It seems like something without a definitive shape. Tsuda-kun is on the right track! The answer is... A bunch of udon noodles warmed to near body temperature! Huh? I totally don't understand what we're trying to hint at with that roundabout explanation! So, without wasting any time... Put them to use, Tsuda-kun! Huh? Use? I don't eat them...? I've got a bad feeling about this. I agree, so, no thank you. Aw... Would you have preferred a hole in an old melon or a cup of bloated ramen instead? This is making less and less sense! I don't get it, but food shouldn't be wasted like that! Ever! A High School Film Contest? Yes! Our film club wants to compete in it. Suzu around here Suzu around here Yes! Our film club wants to compete in it. And so, we're hoping that members of the Student Council will play the roles of protagonist and heroine. Suzu around here Suzu around here Suzu around here Suzu around here Hm, that's a little too embarrassing. I feel the same. I enjoy being embarrassed, but it sounds like a lot of responsibility. What do you think, Tsuda-kun? I'm not very enthusiastic about it either, but we can't just all refuse... All right, I'll do it. Thanks! Oh fine, I'll do it too. Same here. I'm in, too. Huh?! Why? Excuse me, Yokoshima-sensei. We'd like permission to use the multi-purpose assembly hall. What for, exactly? We're going to be entering an upcoming film contest. So we'd like to hold auditions for the role of heroine in our movie. Absolutely not! Holding auditions for a heroine sounds like the premise of a porno. Koyama-sensei, we'd like permission to use the assembly hall. Number 1, Amakusa Shino! Okay, please act out this scene with our protagonist. Sure. Uh... Seems like a scene with a lot of physical contact. Okay, please begin. You never change. You're always pampering her! Well, I'm not doing it because she's special or anything... In that case, I want you... to pamper me, too. Tsuda's chest feels so burly. He must work out. Uh, Prez? Your line? Ah, sorry! I was distracted by feeling your thickness brushing up against my back. There's nothing thick here! Number 2, Mitsuba Mutsumi! My athletic skills are top notch! Would you be our stuntwoman? Huh?! Okay, next person! How'd it go? They told me to cry on the spot and I just couldn't do it. Apparently, that kind of thing does happen at real auditions. Oh? Okay! Dejima-san always tells me I have the most lovely screams. I'll show them what I'm made of! Next person! Coming! Maybe we should stop her... That audition should be going on about now. Let's go take a peek. Mmmhmmm~! I just knew they were filming AV. That can't be! Or so I hope... Number 13, Hagimura Suzu. That school turned co-ed? But it used to be a girls' school, right? Which means the number of female students is naturally higher. Even if the male-to-female ratio is equal in the freshman class, the second and third year classes are all girls! That means there are five times more girls than boys! It's pretty much still just a girls' school! Wow! She's got all the lines memorized already. Putting that 180 IQ to use! That may be so, but you're still someone precious to me. A-a-a-and you to me! But her interactions with Tsuda are a mess. How strange. Can you share with us the reason you chose Hagimura-san? Sure. Because of her height. Huh? Did we forget to explain? The protagonist and heroine are brother and sister. I fell~ So basically, the idea is that a prestigious Heroine (sister) Hero (brother) all-girls' school is turned into a co-ed school, Heroine (sister) Hero (brother) Hero (brother) all-girls' school is turned into a co-ed school, all-girls' school is turned into a co-ed school, and the siblings get swept up in the hectic mess Mysterious Beauty and the siblings get swept up in the hectic mess that follows. That's the premise of the film. Unrequited Love Interest Mysterious Beauty Unrequited Love Interest Mysterious Beauty Big brother! Let's walk home together! Sorry, I forgot my line. Cut! Geez, get it together already. I guess we gotta do it again. She's clearly enjoying this more than she lets on. You've been on my mind ever since I first laid eyes on you! Cut! Do it again, but make yourself seem more embarrassed about it. That's hard to do. This scene is shot from the waist up, right? Correct. I bet you could give a better performance if you were naked from the waist down. That's a way bigger sacrifice than I'm willing to make! That's weird. This mic seems like it has bad reception. Is it broken? That's not good, we absolutely need it for this scene. If we whipped the actors until they're extra sensitive, it would raise the tone of their voices enough to compensate, no? Oh crap, she's looking this way. Extras shouldn't look directly at the camera. Yeah, well, you need to straighten yourself up, Tokki. Who cares about me? If you keep your back hunched like that, your bra is totally gonna show through your shirt. Just leave it to big sis! You can sure do a lot with CG! Putting in a little work can go a long way in making the visuals really shine. For example, this staring scene... Editing in a bridge of spit between them adds a new level of depth! Cut it out! Big brother, you're a... big dummy! Amazing! It hardly even seems like you're acting. Oh please. Here, too. Big brother, I love you! 100% acting! Uh, okay. That's a wrap on filming for today. Thanks all! Good work everybody! There's no school tomorrow, but we're still going to film so please show up. Okay! Don't go sleeping in tomorrow, Tsuda. Right. I think it would be fine to sleep in late. Huh? We're going to be filming at night, apparently. I'm so sleepy that I just can't switch myself on... Pull yourself together. Todoroki's switch is always on. It sure is! That's a different type of switch... What are you all talking about? About how I feel sapped of energy. Like you're being haunted?! Ah, sorry! That's not what I meant! Coochie coochie coo! Feeling more relaxed now? Geez, cut it out, Prez. Coochie coochie coo! Come on, you know better than to stimulate my upper G-spot. Huh?! Good evening. I brought everyone a little refreshment. Thank you! Delish! Thank you, Dejima-san. Don't mention it. Filming like this sure is fun, huh? I've actually worked as an extra once before. Oh really? Should extras also get their makeup done? I didn't bother. Since all the faces just get mosaicked out later. Only if you're filming AV! Are we seriously going through with this? It's necessary in order to capture the true essence of a young man! By the way, it's all just pretend. You know how they fake getting stabbed in those period dramas? It's exactly like that! R-right. It's not actually going in. So it's fine if we just do a thigh fuck! Prez! Calm down and think about this seriously! We may just be acting, but it's still nerve wracking. Ow, ow, ow, ow! Wha?! Nothing went in! Okay, cut! They're depressed over their failure. Let me perk them up. You know, my leg cramped up in the middle of doing it too. But they just thought I was a virgin and it all turned out okay. Siiiiiiiiigh Okay, it's good! That's a wrap! Thank you everyone! I'm so exhausted I can't even move. Need a shoulder to lean on? Thanks. She took it literally. Good work, everyone. Good work, everyone... The box we need is in such an inconvenient spot. Let me handle it. Is she going to bring a stepladder or something? Over here, this way. A person?! Wuzzup? I need you to get that box. Oh, piece of cake. Here you go. Thanks. You're useful, so how about joining the Student Council? I've had my eyes on you for quite some time. President, it's rude to be so upfront. It doesn't matter how desperate you are for a boy. I'm a girl, actually. O-oh my gosh, I'm sorry! Not a problem. It's a common mistake with me. I work out so that I can compete with all the boys. Whoa.... So muscular. Ah, so this is where you all are. Just feel those hard abs. It's okay, they're both girls! We could really use that wonderful body of yours in the Student Council. I want you to seriously consider it. Boo! I wanna slam the wall again, but I can't reach! Thank heavens her plan failed. That makes four of us. It's going to get lively around here. Uh, I'm kind of already in the volleyball club... No problem. You can prioritize that. Just join us here whenever you're free. Wait, is your club practicing now? Aren't they going to get mad that you're taking so long to get back? It's fine! I left to use the bathroom anyways. Everyone on the team probably thinks I'm just taking a dump! You could use a little more feminine humility... A member of the council who's only here in spirit. Like a ghost? You've got a new member? Yes. A very promising rookie. Well, introduce us! That's impossible right now, unfortunately. She is a ghost, after all. 'Sup? So, this is your new guy? New girl, actually. What? Oh, my apologies! If you've got any doubts, you're more than welcome to feel me up and check. Don't be shy, guy. See? I don't have an Adam's apple. Uh, yeah. My height has stretched out even further lately. No malice intended O-oh yeah? I've stretched out lately, too! The number of pi decimal places I can say! Amazing, but I have no idea if they're right! Big brother. We're going to be together forever. Your destined soulmate is... your little sister. What? That's not good! I can cut the thread of fate that binds you. My power will change the soulmate you're destined to be with. Are you serious?! Then you should be my husband instead! Fate is something we decide for ourselves! Big brother...! Congratulations Film Club: Competition Prize We can all feel proud of being Ousai students now. Yep! Light is finally shining down on the Film Club after so long in the shadows! Good for you guys. Back to the shadows... Ah, stop it there. There are a lot of types. For example there's hard and soft... We've got some unintentional product placement in this scene. There are a lot of types. For example there's hard and soft... Can you add in a mosaic for me? Um, like this? Uh-huh, totally. Leave the product in plain sight and use the mosaic to cover the face of the actress... As if! Now it looks like porn! Interesting how you know that. Oh, I just got a good idea! It's really embarrassing to hear my own voice like this. You recorded Tsuda making an embarrassing voice?! No, you just misheard! Quit repeating that one part! We've been doing this nonsense for over 10 years now! Wow. Nature sure is elegant. Yeah. Let's clean up around the school entrance later. Okay. Are you all right? I just choked on my tea a little. It's exciting whenever annual events like this come around. Yeah, just like birthdays and Christmas. In Japan, August 1st is Titty Day! And August 2nd is Panty Day! Maybe there's a Masturbation Day on July 21st or something. Nope, that's not a thing. We're not releasing the movie on that day, either. Oh well, it's not something that can be limited to once a year anyway! Don't give me that "aw, darn it" face! It's come to my attention that morals between boys and girls on campus have grown increasingly indecent. According to my investigation, there are 17 couples currently dating at this school. Nicely researched, Igarashi. Well, that information mainly came from a private source. Private source? That sounds cool, like they're part of a syndicate or something! So, tell us more about these "privates" of yours. Not until you rephrase what you just said. We need to foster a stronger sense of camaraderie here at Ousai. Thus, I propose we require all students to join a club. Very well. We will now hold a vote. If more than two thirds are in favor, the proposal will be submitted at the next staff meeting. President. We don't have a box to collect the votes in... Seriously? That's a problem. Tsuda, can you put these on and go collect the votes for us? No way! Right into my pants, baby. Not. Gonna. Happen. Since the last exam, students of all grades have seen a sharp decline in their scores. If this continues then... Hearing talk of grades makes me uneasy. Enough, Tsuda. Don't doodle. Sorry... Seriously, only girls doodle that character when they feel nervous or shy. That's what you're harping on me for? Don't get the wrong idea! She's saying if you're gonna draw that character, you should do it with your hips instead! Apparently it feels amazing! You three. No more talking. Seems like everyone's having a hard time deciding. Prez? Listen everyone! We can't just let ourselves fall apart! Now is the time to join hands! We'll approve your budget increase if you beat Tsuda. This feels a little bit too tyrannical... Tyranny is fine by me! Ready... Fight! You win! Spending all that time talking really dried my throat up. Oh dear. Open your mouth. Stick out your tongue. Hold your hands out. Don't make this erotic! Guess who's got a case of tendonitis? You've been working too hard, huh? It's annoying. There's only so much I can do with my hand now... No worries! As Vice President, I will do my best to fill your shoes in the meantime! Great. So tomorrow, I need you to make lunches for both Taka-kun and Koto-chan. Huh? Good morning! Hey there! Sorry I'm late! You're looking sharp again today, Ken! Did you manage to wake up today? Good morning everyone! Morning! Morning. Good morning! Morning. Top of the morning! Um... I made you a lunch. Please eat it! Oh my. There's one for your sister, too. Right... This is my first time making lunch for a boy... Wait, forget the gender difference. I just want to make something that appeals to the human palette. A clover themed lunch? That might work! I bet it brings good luck! Hearts?! They fell apart during delivery It's yummy! I can tell Mori is a very thoughtful person. Huh? There's no moisture on the underside of the lid. That means she let it cool before closing it to avoid potential food poisoning. You can tell that much just by looking at the lid? Yeah and I can tell if people peed or pooped by looking at the underside of the toilet seat! Come on, I'm trying to eat here... Well, I'll leave the rest to you. You're heading to the hospital, right? Yeah, unfortunately, I had to cancel all my plans for today. If you're okay with it, I can pick up the slack for you. Are you sure? Let's go shopping together! Do you two always go together? Not always, no. I should have figured. She usually invites me along, though. Oh, a sale. Big sis must have known we'd want some. How many people are in your family? There are only 4 of us, but we all use a ton of mayonnaise. So the more we have the better! That so? Thanks for making my lunch today. Did you enjoy it? Yes! I can tell that you have a kind heart based on the flavor and the precautions you took to keep it healthy. Flattery won't get you anywhere with me. She was hiding how red her face is. Totally embarrassed. Remember earlier when we were all editing that film together? Yeah. The punchline was terrible. What kind of punchline was it, again? You! It was you! Today we're talking about different types of films! You! It was you! Today we're talking about different types of films! Talk about throwing a straight ball... It feels like she actually hit me. Talk about throwing a straight ball... It feels like she actually hit me. These may all seem the same, but they're actually entirely different genres! What? Really? I know the terms are different, but I thought they all meant the same thing. For starters, "Porn Films" refers to the overall genre of erotic movies. Production of these basically started around the same time that film itself was invented. The very first porno in history debuted in 1908 and was made in France! That far back? Why am I the one onscreen here? "Pink Films" refers to soft pornos produced by Japanese companies that involve some aspect of sex or nudity as part of their story. Originally, they were just referred to as "dirty movies." Both those terms seem pretty dated. And again, why are pictures of me onscreen? "Blue Films" are often considered to be the same as pornos, but the term actually refers to illegal films that were produced off the books. Hard to comment on that! Look, I'm gonna ask one more time... The names we call them have changed over time, but the pornos being produced today are mostly the same. Some even say that without adult content, the film industry would never have advanced this far! Yeah, I suppose that's true. Who even took those pictures of me? Wait, I know... That's all for this time. So everybody get out there and... enjoy adult content! We're underage. There is no school tomorrow, but the Student Council is expected to show up for volunteer cleaning duty. So don't forget. It's going to be really cold tomorrow. Maybe I'll just stay at the school overnight... You're always so lazy. Sure! Go for it! Let's all do the night watch together! We're well aware that our teacher is a surprisingly lonely individual. I have to say, our school is really old-fashioned to maintain a night watch. Well, it's one of those relics of the "good old days". I've never been inside the night watch room before. Same here. Of course not! This place is off-limits! Only special, authorized people can enter! So is it like a members-only sex club or what? Who're you calling a dom?! Who're you calling a sub?! I'm not actually an exhibitionist! Date and time... person on duty... Detailed report of activity... We need to go out and do the rounds starting at 9pm. Okay. She's not afraid? She's growing up. There's not much to fear with five of us here. I just have to be sure to make my nightly trip to the bathroom while we're all doing rounds! Pass me the soap. Sure. My hair always gets tangled when it's wet... Hair follicles are a delicate thing! It's important that you start by using a dryer first, and then let it finish drying out naturally. Uh-huh... That's why having a shaved pussy is best. Otherwise your pubic hair gets entwined during sex. We may be inexperienced, but we're not stupid! Wow! Oden stew for dinner? This is great! We all brought some ingredients after stopping by home for a change of clothes. What did you bring, Tsuda? Some leftovers from last night. This konjac, I assume. Definitely seems like it was heavily used. Smells like squid. One of those comments is going in a totally different direction! You sure it's okay to drink beer, sensei? One never hurt anybody. But we have to do the rounds after this... Huh? That's weird. I'm starting to feel tipsy... It's because you drank on an empty stomach. Except my stomach was already full from an enema. You really are wasted... or are you being serious? She drank herself right to sleep. What should we do? There's only one option. We go out and do the night watch ourselves! This is a disaster! The formation that I planned for is impossible now! Let's get started. You're my right-hand man, Tsuda. So stand to my right. Sure. Aria, you're in front. Hagimura, you stay behind me. So, why'd you give us these positions? Because I know that in the bathroom Aria always wipes from the front and Hagimura from the back. You just came up with that on the fly! But you're actually right! We're moving to the second floor next. Aria, Hagimura, watch your step. Okay. Tsuda, be careful where you put your hands. You never know what may happen! Who on earth swings their hands that hard?! Crap... Crap. That noise... It came from our classroom! Who's in here?! Oh, it's just a cat? I'm not hearing any purring when I pet it, so it's probably a human. Then quit sexually harassing it! I snuck back to get something that I forgot... I thought you guys were teachers! That's no reason to sneak in after hours! I'm sorry... Give her a break. I have a good idea. As punishment, you can come do rounds with us. Huh? Did a boy seriously just invite me to go watch the night sky? It's way too dark outside for that. Formation GET! No problems in the gym. Let's check the stage just to be safe. What's up with this "T" mark? This is used in blocking, to tell the actors where to stand on stage. But I wonder why it's shaped like a "T"? Look! Hey! Hey! What's gotten into you? Don't even ask. Okay, let's move on. Right. Careful. It's dark, so watch your feet. Okay... I'm sorry. Something wrong? What are they doing? I can't really tell... Thanks for doing the rounds for me! Here, have a drink! Keep it together next time, okay? Right... Um, I'm not a big fan of carbonated drinks... Want to swap? You're in for a rough future unless you embrace carbonated drinks. Why is that? Huh? Isn't it obvious? That's totally not a drink in your right hand... Uh-oh. We left the lights on in here all night. That's okay, everyone makes that mistake. Like how I totally forgot this digital camera and left it recording the whole time. You definitely did that on purpose! Fess up, Hata. What did you record on this? I'm not sure. But as long as you haven't done anything indecent, what's there to worry about? Point taken. Still, I would like to confirm the contents. Go for it! Look, it's Shino-chan! She keeps playing with her hair. Seems innocent enough to me. That was when I was thinking about tying my hair around my nipples for some hardcore play. Thank god I decided against it! Looks like Hagimura was filmed next. It doesn't bother me, since I didn't do anything worth mentioning. Hagimura is starting to strip down. Huh? She's trying to show as much skin as possible. Huh?! She stripped off her blazer. And rolled up her sleeves! I can't believe I fell for that! Too hot... Here comes Aria. Why did you take off your bra?! I didn't! I was actually thinking about putting my bra on, which is why I pulled it out of my breast pocket. That still means you were going braless! But then I remembered something important and left the room for a moment. You left your bra right out in the open... Looks like Tsuda showed up around then! No matter what happens, let's pretend we never saw this. Yeah. Even Tsuda is totally pretending he never saw it, as if he's protecting her privacy! How gallant can he be?! What are you all doing? I always knew you weren't the type to hide and sniff them in secret! Huh? I agree. If anything, you're the type who sniffs them in front of their owner to cause intense shame. So, I'm curious. What exactly are you talking about? You want to air a radio drama during the lunchtime broadcast? Yes. I'll be the scriptwriter and all of you will be the talent. It's a two-part event that will be aired live. That sounds like fun! Voice acting seems like it's pretty difficult, though. All you have to do is put some honest emotion behind it. Shino-chan, look at this! Wow Aria, one of your globes is hanging out for everyone to see. The fact they mean a real globe isn't coming across at all! The life of our protagonist, Takahiko, takes a drastic turn when his parents remarry and he gets 3 sisters-in-law. The tantalizing desires expressed by the 3 girls cause him to have all sorts of feelings! What do I do?! The tantalizing desires expressed by the 3 girls cause him to have all sorts of feelings! What do I do?! A love story, huh? So basically, it's a love square? Wait, wouldn't a square be missing a connection? Oh, you're right. Technically, it's a quad relationship. That must get interesting in the bedroom. No comments from the peanut gallery. The upright and caring elder sister: Shizuno. Takahiko, what do you want to eat tonight? Cut! You need to call him by a nickname there, in order to show a greater level of intimacy. Ta... Taka... kun... Hm? What was that? Ta... You need to say it louder and clearer. Huh? Couldn't hear you! You need to say it louder and clearer. Quit pressuring her to use my perfectly ordinary name like it's some kind of vulgar swear! The sultry and seductive middle sister: Maria. Taka-chan! The hook on my bra got stuck. Could you undo it for me? You know, Takahiko seems like a really innocent guy. Would he even know how to unhook a bra? Good point. Let's change that line. Taka-chan! Am I wearing this strap-on dildo right? Uh, yeah, but what are you gonna do with it?! That'll get our broadcast cancelled for sure... The bashful and always tsundere little sister: Suzuko She catches sight of Takahiko getting awfully close with Shizuno, and runs out into the night until she's totally out of breath. Let's use sound effects and add extra realism to the scene. The hell kind of sound effect is that?! Which lady will Takahiko give his heart to? To be continued! That was so awesome! What's going to happen next?! You have to wait for tomorrow to find out. I don't think I'll be able to sleep until I know what happens! To solve the next problem, you'll need to use the same formula... You know, Hata-san is out sick today. Yeah. Seems like we'll have to postpone tomorrow's broadcast. On the contrary! I've finished 90% of the script. You can just ad-lib the part that's still missing. What part didn't you finish? The confession scene. You choose which girl wins, okay? What?! Oh, come on! Ouch! I stabbed myself with the skewer... Just lick it better. What am I feeling so nervous about? This isn't a real love confession. I should just play it cool. Ow! I was so distracted by my thoughts that I bit my tongue... "I hurt my tongue... and I want you to lick it all better for me." I think we just invented a brand new pick-up line! As if that'll catch on! Good morning! Good morning! I'm excited to hear the continuation of your radio drama! Ugh, that's the third time someone's told me that today. Everyone is totally on edge, but it's not like it's a real confession... Suzu-chan, you're sitting in my chair. It's way too tall for you, isn't it? Whoops! I was so spaced out, I didn't notice. Prez! You've got some intense dark circles under your eyes... There's a big confession scene at the end, right? I stayed up all night thinking of the best thing to say. I see. My favorite color is pink. Would you like to make something pink of our very own? By mixing virginal blood with white semen. All night and that's the best you could do? I thought of a confession, too! Listen! Go for it... Because I care for you so much, I want you to know my secret. They say that women have three holes, but that's just a lie. I actually have five holes! That's just how a hymen works! As a virgin, this joke is going over my head... Okay. It's my turn to tell you how I feel. I know it's not good to keep this bottled up. I realized something... The precious person... in my heart is... Thump thump. Thump thump. Thump thump. Thump thump. Doesn't watching bittersweet love unfold just make your heart throb? No, not really... Thump thump. Sorry to surprise you like that. Totally fine. It's just make-believe, after all. How wonderful, what a great ending. I loved it. She's suddenly not sick anymore... Uh-huh. Well, let's hear the reason that you chose Aria. Staaaaaaaare. Uh-huh. Well, let's hear the reason that you chose Aria. Well, I didn't have any ulterior motives. It's just... Some weird rumors about me and the Prez have already been circulating because of Hata-san. Oh... So I figured it was best to avoid causing you any trouble. And since Hagimura is in my class, I was worried she might get teased by our classmates. Oh... In other words, he chose Shichijo-san because he hasn't triggered any flags with her. But it seems like a new flag has been raised as a result. Wow. A cherry blossom petal. They say having one with your tea is good luck. Tsuda Takatoshi... He is... no longer with us. I've finished, Prez. Thanks. Okay. Your reports are always so killer. What? Oh, I mean that in the good way. I totally misunderstood you. It happens all the time. Like whenever there's a pair of panties lying around, it's hard to tell if a girl just undressed or a guy used them to jerk off. Yeah, that never happens. Excuse me. You're here nice and early. Naturally! Your braids are so adorable. Maybe I should get some too! Y-you think so? The would make good whips! You like that?! Sorry, need to use the bathroom. The meeting is about to start, so hurry it up. Um... What's the problem? The zipper on my pants broke. It won't close. Huh?! I love them! Apologies for being late! You sure took your time. They say that standing directly behind someone like that is a sign of affection. Unfortunately, the real reason is nowhere near that romantic... Is something indecent going on here? Oh boy, Igarashi-san will totally faint if she sees it. Uh... you're not allowed to get close! Sounds to me like Suzu-chan is claiming dibs on Tsuda-kun's crotch. Sorry, forget what I just said. Good morning. Good morning! Mori-chin. Morning. Um, president? I feel like you're always just a little too touchy... Understood. Then I will maintain this much distance. But we're still touching! You look pretty unprofessional from under the table. Because it's hot out today. Well, I would follow your example, but like they say: you can lead a horse to water... Go on, just take a sip. Oh please, it's only an idiom, I'm definitely not drinking any of your nasty foot water. Cut it out. Oh please, it's only an idiom, I'm definitely not drinking any of your nasty foot water. Cut it out. Tokki! Impressive. You've started showing up on time for the judo club's morning practice. It feels great to establish a daily routine with purpose! So, this next match I've got coming up... That was an awesome move yesterday! I need to get changed, too. Hello? Taka-nii, are you still at home? Yep. Thank heavens! I forgot something important. Please bring it for me, Taka-nii! What is it? My underwear! You wore your swimsuit instead, didn't you? I'll come get them once morning practice is over. Just wait in the Student Council room for me. Time to get started! Thank you for the lesson! My life is so over if anyone finds them in my bag... Good timing, Tsuda. We're performing bag inspections today. There is no god. Um... can we put it off until tomorrow? There's no point if it's not a surprise. Are you carrying something risque or what? N-no... Just deal with it. I already had my bra get confiscated from me. Huh?! But why? It was a testicle bra! I was hoping to have you wear it. Never been happier to hear something got confiscated! Don't do it! Oh, perfect timing! Explain it to them! Nice and tight, nice and tight. Oh, perfect timing! Explain it to them! Oh, perfect timing! Explain it to them! These are yours, right?! No, they're not. These belong to our big sis Uomi... He was walking around with Uomi's underwear! Why the hell do you keep them in the same drawer?! What did you just try and hide? Nothin'. Is it something unseemly? Of course not. Then let me see it! It's a picture of you with a ghost, that's all. You caught a ghost on film?! Did you take this when we were cleaning the archives room? Yeah. And you didn't fake it? It's 100% genuine. I can never go into that room again... Huh? My cellphone's missing! Didn't you leave it on a shelf while we were cleaning so it didn't get broken? Then it's in the archives room. The ghost! Is it just me, or does this look like Yokoshima-sensei? So it's a wraith?! Just give the horror stories a break, okay. No doubt about it, that's me. Huh? My foundation got stuck on the window. And how exactly did that happen? Because I was using it to give myself a naughty pig nose. Is that all? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Is this really "all's well that ends well"? Hi all! It's time for "Yokoshima Teacher English"! Geez, you're acting all high and mighty because this segment was so popular in the last movie. You know it! Today I'm going to have you practice pronouncing the name of this cocktail. Quick Fuck! Quick Fuck! Quick Fuck! Quick Fuck! How could you all say such a vulgar thing! You'll never get away with that in English-speaking countries! You're the one making them say it! By the way, totally unrelated, but the most popular segment from the last movie wasn't actually mine. It was the credit roll that came afterwards. Fuck! I'm just as upset about that as you are! This really takes me back. What a great time. Huh? What's going on? Why am I crying? Laugh.. Laugh dammit. Oh my. What a coincidence seeing you here. Good afternoon. If you've got time, will you help me with some reporting? Sure. Welcome! We have a special event going on for couples right now! Huh? Here is your order. Now that's what I'm talking about. I wanted pictures of this special dessert plate for couples. Is that all? You can't underestimate events like these, they're huge news among the general public right now. That and swingers events. That's only the hardcore types... Say "ah"! One more, "ah"! I've only ever seen little kids use their tongues to play around with liquid in straws like that, and never with such a serious face. Let's get to the bottom of this. Okay! I'm sorry. We're currently holding an couples-only event. We are a couple! I'm sorry. We'll leave. The couple chairs. First time I've ever used them. Those are couples chairs! They're using couple chairs?! Wonder if there's a vibration function. Here we go. Let's leave. Huh? But what about keeping an eye on Tsuda? Their chairs might start creaking. Then you two can stay. Farewell... Such an amorous kiss. Huh? It's more of a bittersweet kiss, no? But we're right at the part where the guy shoves his tongue down her throat and it triggers her gag reflex. Okay, you're banned from writing any film reviews. Lastly, we have a couple exclusive footbath. Feels great after a whole day of walking around. That's for sure. Wish I could stay like this forever. So, are you saying... you want to pretend to be my boyfriend forever? I clearly meant the footbath. Takatoshi-kun! Ranko-chan! So, you were helping her out with this report? Yes. All I can say is... I hope you die in a fire, normie! Shino-chan... Sounds like Tsuda-kun's meat twinkie was ready to blow some cream! Read it with your mind out of the gutter, please! I just had a thought. Doesn't it feel like we're in a rut? Huh? Research does say a monotonous lifestyle is bad for your health. Yeah, it can apparently lead to issues like depression or worse. Hearing that does make me yearn for some change. Then it's settled. We're gonna play a game of job switcheroo today! You're awfully prepared for "just" having thought of this... Excuse me! President? What can I do for you? No way! President Shino and Suzu-chan have swapped bodies?! She jumped right to the most insane explanation! Anyways! I'm here to request a budget increase! 100,000 yen! Denied. Fine! 5000 yen! She's going for the "start with a ridiculous request to make your next one seem much more reasonable" strategy. She's a skilled negotiator. So it's like... Let's bang. Let me just put the tip in. Let's thigh fuck. It would be easy to settle for heavy petting! I'm this close to calling the cops. Hey Prez... no, Amakusa-senpai. This is the first time you've ever called me by my name, huh? Is it really? What's with the angry puffy cheeks, Suzu-chan? The air reeks in here so I'm holding my breath, that's all! Tsuda's so terrible at math that he's already tapped out. But you've adapted to your new position well, Amakusa-senpai. I've enjoyed jotting down words ever since I was a little kid. It all started when we played hanetsuki during New Year's and the loser would get their face written on. Eventually it spread to the whole body! That's a horrific memory to have, geez! Time to go out on patrol. Roger! Bringing up the front of the line as leader. Gotta say, it feels good. Don't organize yourselves from shortest to tallest! Doing something out of the ordinary really puts a fresh spin on life. While we're at it, let's order something for lunch that we've never had before! Okay! Since it's cold out today, fish soup for me! Well, I guess you're not ready to "eat the fish" directly. What? I'm talking about honest-to-goodness soup here. From Suzu-chan's perspective, it's more like gush soup, huh? We already had a punchline, don't make it worse by delivering a second one! Guess this is the boy's bathroom. Sorry, but my memories of Ousai are from back when it was an all-girls school. Gosh, I feel just like Rip Van Winkle. Nobody's airing out their clothes in the classrooms or throwing sanitary pads around anymore. I forgot my pads! Nobody's airing out their clothes in the classrooms or throwing sanitary pads around anymore. Here! Nobody's airing out their clothes in the classrooms or throwing sanitary pads around anymore. Here! Thank you! Cool, so could you go ahead and leave because there are other guys in here... Thank you! Cool, so could you go ahead and leave because there are other guys in here... Hey boy. Are you dating Amakusa? Or is it Shichijo? Suzu-chan? Women are good at digging up relationship details. I need to answer carefully... I'll leave that up to your imagination. What? You got her pregnant?! Hold up! Don't warp the nuance of what I said! Excuse me, I have a question about English I was hoping you could help me with. Sorry, but I'm pretty bad with English! Is that so? Oh, it's Furuya-senpai. I didn't know you were visiting. Yeah, I came to return this dey-v-dey I borrowed a while back. Those aren't allowed on school grounds, you know. Geez, her English is way worse than "pretty bad"! I want to establish a mascot character for Ousai Academy! I've already completed the first prototype. Since when...? That's the reason I asked you here. I'd love to see it. It's been sized just for you. I'm wearing it?! The design concept was "keep it loose"! This is the loose part. Stop with the weird gimmicks! Shazam! I'm here to report on the mascot character! Oh yeah, this is pretty high quality! Is it hard to breathe in there? Yeah, a bit. It's a challenge to figure out how the actors in those costume porn videos actually feel. Yeah, they're either really turned on or struggling to breathe. Does that genre seriously exist...? Shall we go outside and see what people think? I'm not sure how the students will feel about it. Ugh, it makes me so anxious! Right? Whoa, what is that?! It's so cute! Seems to be catching on. It's so adorable! Awesome! We nailed it! Say cheese! The mascot is a hit, but the president remains just as anxious... I wanna take a picture with it next! Sure! Okay. Look over here! Gosh, so cute! That's enough! Tsuda! Quit brown-nosing with every lady you see! I mean, don't stick your "nose" in where it doesn't belong! Was it really necessary to rephrase that?! Well now, this is a good opportunity. Let's get a picture of you two together. Uh, hold on! Give her a hug from behind, Tsuda-kun. Um, okay. H-hey! Watch where you put those hands! Did I put my hand somewhere weird like on her face? I can't see very well in here. I'm sorry, (the fabric of the costume is so thick) I didn't even notice. I see... so flat you didn't notice... Hello, I'm Sakura-tan! You've got the role down pat! Yep, we completely share the same body and soul. Can I stop now...? Sure. Uh-oh, it won't come off. The clasp is buried... Then just take off the head for now! Ow, ow, ow! Oh, sorry! The head won't come off either! What a disaster! I'll go grab some sewing supplies, so just hang tight! So hot... Need some water? Here. If you need to pee, you can use this catheter! I'll just hold it in! That was agonizing. I'm so sorry. It's okay. Actually, I'm having a lot of fun with this! I'll do it again whenever you want me to. Really? Then let's brainstorm how we can use it! What if we had Sakura-tan go and visit some of the nearby nurseries and kindergartens? Great idea, Suzu-chan! Okay! Let's make some calls. That sound okay to you, Tsuda? I'll do anything that makes you happy, Prez. Thank you. Let's keep making Ousai Academy a place where every day is a party! Yeah! But then... Tsuda Takatoshi... left my side forever. Attention, boys & girls!

You're Sakura-tan! And you'll be Sakura-tan forever and ever! Right. I am Sakura-tan... Why did you show up late for the kindergarten visit, of all days?! I'm sorry... Do you realize how much I had to apologize and bow my head on your behalf?! I'm sorry... Go on. Tell me who you are. I'm Tsuda- Huh?! I'm Sakura-tan... And for the rest of your life? I'll be Sakura-tan... My god, Tsuda is so adorable! I can't get enough! I think I'm becoming a major sadist! I'll keep going just a little longer! How long is this going to continue...? Tsuda! Tell me who you are! Like I said, I'm Sakur- wait, you just called me Tsuda! Huh? No I didn't! You did! Did not! You totally did, I heard it! Yeah, well, Sakura-tan doesn't sound like that at all! You never told me how she's supposed to sound! Sakura-tan doesn't talk! Are you kidding? Just be quiet! It's a little too late for that now, isn't it! Just be quiet! It's a little too late for that now, isn't it! Darn it, that Tsuda. He left his Sakura-tan costume just lying around! Guess I'll clean up for him. It still feels warm... Oh man, I can't believe I left it behind! Geez, you're such a klutz. Cut him some slack, everybody forgets things. Like how I totally forgot to wear any panties today! Normal people never forget that... Ah! This is so mortifying! Don't look at me! Uh, there's no need to panic because we can't even see your face. So... Why were you wearing the Sakura-tan head? W-well, um... Pardon me. Slide, slide, slide... What's up, Hata-san? I left something behind in here. Yoink! What the? There it is. Again?! Try all you want, but you'll never catch us doing anything indecent! So, you don't mind if I watch the footage? Be my guest. Wait! Something the matter? Uh, no. Taka-kun? Nobody's here. Sniff, sniff. Oh, this smells like Taka-kun. You already did it before me?! Tee-hee! When even?! "Before me"? Leave me alone! You got the wrong idea! Care to explain? Got any comment? Leave me alone! You got the wrong idea! Leave me alone! You got the wrong idea! Smells like someone! Smells like someone! Give us the deets! Good grief. Nobody is more popular. Yeah, everybody really does love Sakura-tan. Huh?! What? Was it something I said?
