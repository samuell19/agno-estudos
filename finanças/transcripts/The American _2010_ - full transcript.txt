Corrected, augmented & synchronised by Fingersmaster. Enjoy! You know, I thought I maybe drive into town. You want something? No. Hunter? No, they would travel in pairs, I think. Come on. Come on! What's going on? You have a gun? Why would you have a gun? Jack? Jack? Jack? Is he dead? Jack? Go to the house and call the police. Go! Yeah? It's Jack. I'm here. What do you mean, "here"? Rome. There is a bar near the main station. Caff√® Ligeti, Via Volturna. Wait there. Jack. Pavel. It's been a while. Who was the girl? A friend. A friend? Who were the Swedes? I'm working on that. It's going to take some time. Did she set you up? She had nothing to do with it. Pity. You can't stay here. I've made arrangements for you to leave town while I sort this out. Take a right outside the bar. Then second left. Via Magenta. You'll find a dark blue Fiat Tempra with Pescara plates. I've marked a small town on the map. Castelvecchio. Stay there. Lay low, till you get my call. Don't talk to anyone. And above all, don't make any friends, Jack. You used to know that. Hello. Hello. America. Ah, you're the American. Yes, the American Can I help you? I'm no good with machines. - You are American. - Yes. You speak Italian? A little. On vacation? A working vacation. I'm a photographer. - Photographer? - Yes. What kind of photographer? Pictures of architecture, landscape... - People? - No people. Just for publications, for magazines. Magazines. Which magazines? Different ones. Very well. You must share a glass of wine with me. - Come tonight. - Very kind. No. You want to know the truth about Abruzzo? A priest sees everything. Yeah? It's Jack. You don't answer the cell I gave you. I'm no good with machines. You don't make this easy for me, Jack. I've got a job for you. It's a custom fit. You don't even have to pull the trigger. I'll think about it. The quality of the brandy is good. Smooth. The only good thing to come from the French. You study our history? No. You come to Italy to make a guide book and you don't care about history? I take pictures. Of course. You are American. You think you can escape history. You live for the present. I try to, Father. Good morning. I'd like some cheese... - Cacciotina or Pecorino? - Pecorino, yes. - This one? - How much? Twelve euros. Thank you. Your change. Thank you. Very kind of you. Thank you. You're welcome You're welcome. There, your coffee. Thank you. What would you like, sir? Yes. Coffee... Americano. Americano. Thank you. I'm Edward. Mathilde. Range? 150-175 meters. Time? Five seconds. Seven at the most. Targets? One. Firing rate? Rapid. Magazine capacity? Large. Preferably a 5.56. The weapon must be fairly light and compact. How compact? As compact as possible. You want an automatic rifle to fit inside a woman's purse? A small vanity case would be permissible. A small briefcase would be possible. Noise? Silencer. I can only give you a suppressor. It'll dampen the decibels and dislocate the sound source and reduce the muzzle flash. I can't make you silent, but I can make you invisible as long as you're willing to lose some range. Two o'clock. Light blue shirt, sunglasses. Is he with you? I didn't see him. In any case, I'm alone. There, your americano. Thank you. I can accept a slight loss of range. You want a weapon with the firing capacity of a submachine gun and the range of a rifle. Can you do it? Clarke. A parcel. Clarke. Thank you. See you tonight. All the sheep in my flock are dear to me, but some are dearer than most, especially those that have lost their way. Fabio. He's a mechanic. "Car doctor." But I think his work is not always legal. Did you ever want to be anything but a priest? Have you ever wanted to be anything other than a photographer? I do what I'm good at. You have the hands of a craftsman, not an artist. You are good with machines, yet you told me just the opposite when we first met. Journalism cannot make you a rich man. Perhaps you are rich already? A man can be rich if he has God in his heart. I don't think God's very interested in me, Father. Fabio. I've got some damage to my car. Yes. I'm taking photographs in the mountains. Okay, okay. No, I need tools for a broken drive shaft. My garage, your garage. Yes, thank you. How much? Thank you. Hello again, Edward. Does this place get many visitors? This is the only way to get here. Did you check it for footprints and tire tracks? Three days ago I walked the river, both sides. Let's check again. Rounds? I prepared two kinds, 10 jacketed, 10 expanding. I'd like 20 of each. And 10 explosive. Not a problem. Will mercury do? Mercury will do very nicely. I brought my own target. Right there. Muzzle velocity? About 360 miles an hour. That's including 20 miles an hour off for the sound suppression. Ruger? M14. I've not had one before. You'll find it easy. I've re-balanced it for the weight of the suppressor. The fulcrum's two centimeters forward from the grip, but that shouldn't matter if you're firing, I'm assuming you are, from a fixed position. There's no major recoil issues. You should be able to hold any target, even the smallest. Go to the flower. Fire into these reeds, say, two steps away from me. Two bursts, five seconds apart. The sound suppression is superb. I couldn't place the direction of fire. I shall require the rounds and the weapon by the first of next month. In the meantime, could you tighten the adjusting screws on the sight? They're too loose. What about the case? It's a briefcase. Samsonite. Black. Combination locks. You have a number you prefer? - 014. - 014. What do you want done with these? How thoughtful. "Asprinio." I don't know it. It's like Moscato, only sparkling. It wouldn't look right if the picnic wasn't touched. You chilled the wine, - I thought... - Had to be chilled. Italian cops. Don't move. So beautiful. It's endangered. You like coming here. It serves a purpose. You've never taken a woman here before? No. Perhaps you do not have a woman in your life? Thank you, for a lovely day, Mr Butterfly. Sergio Leone. Italian. No. Yes. It's like you can't stop thinking about something. Or someone. You don't have to act. Act? You might have to with other clients, but you don't have to with me. I want you to be exactly who you are. I came here to get pleasure, not to give it. Maybe I pretend very well. You give me more tips than the other girls get. I don't sleep with the other girls. Hi, Mr Butterfly. - How are you? - Good, thank you. This is my friend Anna. Hi. Pleased to meet you, Anna. Do you want to join me for some coffee? We're going to see an American movie. Anna's learning English. I would love to go to America. But perhaps we can see each other soon? On Wednesday I'm free. Okay, I'll be there. Where? Our usual place? Our usual place. I forgot. Where is our usual place? Let's go someplace new. You can decide. - Locanda Grapelli? - Great! Locanda Grapelli, good food. Grapelli. - See you there? - I'll see you there. - At 8:00? - At 8:00. Good bye, Mr Butterfly. Anna, it's nice to meet you. Fuck. Yeah? The Swedes found me. Stay put. Finish the job. How the fuck did they know I was here? Because you've lost your edge, Jack. Buongiorno! You're up early! I needed some air. I walk here to meditate. I thank God for certain favors he has granted me, and I ask him to look after those of my friends... who are sinners. All men are sinners. Some are greater sinners than others. But those who seek peace have much sinning in their history. Maybe. Forgive me, this is the priest in me speaking, but you have done much sinning, Mr Clarke. And you still do. Something happened here last night. Everything I've done, I've had good cause to do. Do you wish to tell me? - To confess? - Yes. For what reason? For your own sake. Perhaps I can pray for you? Perhaps. I wonder how many bastards have been made here. You work in metal. You were given some steel by Fabio, the car doctor. Where was he conceived, Father? Fabio, the car doctor. Why do you ask me that? You have each other's photos. You have each other's eyes. Was he conceived here, under the trees at night, like all the other bastards? I do not remember, Signor. It was many years ago. In the end it is I who confesses to you. Do you want me to do the same? For your own good. You cannot doubt the existence of Hell. You live in it. It is a place without love. Perhaps I have no right to wear these robes. But I do have a heart full of a father's love. Something close to his heart! And for that I am both grateful and happy. What do you have, my friend? Hi. I was not sure you were coming. I wasn't sure you meant me to. Of course, I did. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Thank you. - There. - Thank you. Thank you. No, Thank you. - Can I ask you something? - Sure. Are you married? No. I was sure this was your secret. Why do I have to have a secret? You're a good man, but... you have a secret. Excuse me. No, no, really. Thank you. No. He thinks we are a couple. That's okay. Thank you. Thank you. Hello? I need some more time. You're testing my patience. Just give me a few more days. You'll get two days, then you make a drop. Hi. Hi. Where we go? Someplace beautiful. A picnic. Yeah. A picnic. I have to practice my English. Today, we are going to have a picnic. It is a beautiful day. Where we go? You'll see. I think it's good we stay close to the road. Don't worry. I've been this way many times taking photographs. Only you come here? Yes. I'm going to swim in the water. You come? It's cold. Maybe. Come! Come, Mr Butterfly. It's beautiful, no? We make love in the water? What's wrong? We should have our lunch. Look. It's a bullet. Maybe the hunters are here. I don't think so. I'm cold. Edward. Is that your real name? Will you put this behind me? What? What? Nothing. Thank you. I just don't understand what the hell you're doing with a gun. A friend of mine give to me. The two prostitutes were killed in Pescara, right? Did you see what they do to them? The police showed me the photographs. I want to feel safe with clients. Does it make you feel safe with me? You're not a client. Then why is it in your bag? Because I work tonight. There's a procession. A procession? Yes. Tomorrow. In Castel del Monte. We go to this together? Maybe. Really? And after... After that, after tomorrow, and the next day... I can't stay forever, Clara. It's time to go home. - Take me home with you. - I can't. Stay forever. Yeah? I'll make the delivery and then I'm out. Pavel? Okay, Jack. You're out. Hello? Now, you listen to me carefully. Coffee. Two. I see you've brought it in with you. Everything's here as we agreed. What's this? Candy for your trip. I thought you might have a sweet tooth. That's very kind of you. I guess I'll be reading about this in the Tribune. Yes. I expect so. I'm just going to the ladies, wait here. Okay? I'm fine. You? Just fine. You won't need your gun. You never know. Final payment. Buy yourself a retirement clock. Goodbye, Mr Butterfly. Hello? What happened? There wasn't the opportunity. Find one. I'm following him now. I was looking for you. I'm here. What are you doing tonight? I work tonight. Don't. If I ask you to come away with me, would you? Come away with you? Why not? - Together? - Together. Forever? Forever. I love you. - I love you. - I love you. I want you to take this and meet me at the river. - Eduardo. - Go! Go! Who do you work for? Who? Same man as you, Jack. I'm sorry, Father. Eduardo! Eduardo! Eduardo! -- English --
