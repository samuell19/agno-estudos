Listen for your name Andy Trainor, Michael Hudman, Zach Steinhart, Zach Berman, Leif Quincy, Sam Pace, and JJ. - [phone camera clicks] - Hey! Perv! Weirdo!

Well, how was camp? Any good digs? Yeah. Some. And the other kids? Fine. [overly playful] And the boooooys? Oh. That nice, huh? [smirks] Don't. ♪ 'Cause we're Girls girls girls girls ♪ ♪ And we like Boys boys boys boys ♪ ♪ We're girls girls Girls girls ♪ ♪ And we like Boys boys boys boys ♪ - [switches off radio] - ♪ Girls girls... ♪ What! I missed you! Can't I miss you? Yeah, I missed you, too. Great! So then next year you stay home! - Maybe. - Oh, come on, baby girl, don't you think you're getting a little old for that camp? - If it's cause of Tommy... - It's not. [Michelle] Well, if it is... - It's not! - I'm just saying, it wouldn't kill you to maybe dress a bit sexier - every now and then. - Okay, look, Mom! Tommy is cute, but he's not why I go there. You know that. So, please stop. - Fine. - Please. Fine. Fine. Can you scratch my arm? Hm-mm. [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music continues] [deep sigh] You wanna drive? You? Really? Sure! Don't I need like a permit? Do you want to drive or not? [car door opens] - [car door closes] - Oh, look at you! All excited! Yaaaay! [chuckles] Yes! Seatbelt. - [seatbelt locks] - [Michelle] Check, okay. Hands at ten-two, foot on the brake and put the car into drive. But che-check your blind spot first. And-and the mirror. Oh, God! You'll have to adjust those. And the seat... God, is it getting hot in here? Wait! But, don't forget to signal! Mom! Too much? Okay. Oh! Look at you. [sighs] Ah! [laughs] You're doing great. Okay, steady. You show, hey... Libby, Libby, Libby, road! [breathes deeply] - Mom! - What? It's just for one of the vacant lots. We talked about this! Oh. We're gonna need money for college, baby girl. The romance stories aren't selling like they used to. I know. Betty said she's still willing to show us around at SUNY Adirondack. SUNY. [Michelle] What? It's affordable. [chuckles] Yeah, affordable, huh? What? Don't you dare! It was a gift! - Gi... gift? - Yeah. From who? [sighs] Mm-mm. You'll see - Um, whose...? - Great job, baby girl!!! - [car door opens] - [Michelle] Come on. [car door slams] [Michelle] We're here! [car door slams] Babe? [heavy footsteps] Babe? Mom? Hello? - What are you...? - [John] Hey! [Libby breathes deeply] Holy crap. [Michelle] I know. I'm writing him constantly. Eww. [Michelle] Hm-mm. Who wears a speedo? Libs, this is my boyfriend, John. Miss Wells, [breathes deeply] it's a pleasure to finally meet you! Libby? [giggles] Hey. I hope you don't mind that I'm here! I know it's your Lake house and I'm not trying to take away time with your Mom. So... Oh! I've actually got something for you. Can you give me just a minute? You have a boyfriend? I know! Why didn't you tell me? [scoffs] I thought it was just a fling! I mean, look at him. Is he what you were "doing" every time I called? Okay. This is for you. Your mom told me that you're really into archeology. This is the Navajo tribes' "stone of life". It's the only "object" they really assign any value to outside of its utility. And, if you look here, the upside-down crescent moon shape? It's called a 'Naja' by the Navajo, but [chuckles] it's actually Moorish in origin! It represents the Phoenician goddess of fertility. Basically, this bracelet has origins from the Western and Eastern world all the way back to the very beginning of civilization. So... Thanks. You're very welcome. Oh, if you want the gift receipt, it's in the box. Well, who's hungry? [bangles clink] [Libby breathing rapidly] Hey [breathes deeply] [breathes deeply] Yeah. Don't be a weirdo. [breathes deeply] Please. [John] Honey, dessert. What am I gonna have for dessert? [Michelle laughing] [laughs] Hey! Hi. Hope you're hungry, baby girl! You look nice. You cooked? Of course, I cooked! Eh-eh-eh I'll get that. - Oh, yeah? - [John chuckles] - Thank you. - Thank you. Mm-mm. Oh, that tastes really good. Mm-mm. [laughs] [John] So, Libby? How was camp? Uh. It was okay. - [John] Yeah? - Yeah. I think it's getting like, uh, a little routine. How did you guys meet? [Michelle breathes deeply] I will let you take that one. Well, uh, I-I came out early this year because some work needed to be done to the back deck. I swear! Anyways, I was outside writing on the porch one day when John just kind of appeared! [laughs] I... I've been at the Lake all year. I, uh, I'm studying a few species here. He's an aquatic geneticist! - Wait, really? - [John] Hm-mm. Yeah. I'm part of a small research team. We're sort of scattered around the region here. What are you researching? [John] Mostly freshwater animals. We're trying to solve a problem in nature. Hm-mm. Libs! [indistinct]. What problem? Well Can I borrow this, please? - Of course. - [John chuckles] So the earth has a finite amount of freshwater. [water gurgles] In fact, only 2.5% of the Earth's water is fresh, leaving 97.5% - [clanking] - as salt water. And within those freshwater ponds and streams, and glaciers, many, many species live. Unfortunately, due to continual increase in the Earth's temperature, there isn't enough rain to supply these freshwater systems. And there's more evaporation in the oceans leaving a planet [clanking] with an overall increasing level [clanking] of salinity. And now, some of the species, well, they can't survive in such a rapidly changing world without some major adaptation. So, I am here to speed up Mother Nature. And hopefully in the end [water flowing] make it so that certain species can survive in a saltwater world. [Michelle breathes deeply] Hm-mm. So, basically, he's saving the world. [John] Oh, come on. I'm definitely not. [laughs] [Michelle laughs] [John clears throat and coughs] - Hon? - [John coughs intensely] [John] Oh, man. Sorry. [coughs] Ah, I coughed up a lung there. You know that phrase. - It's actually, well... - Honey, honey. [exhales] Mm. [Libby gasps] [Libby moans] [Libby breathes deeply] [clank] [in-can drink fizzes] [Michelle] [moans] Ah! [moaning] Aaaah! [continues moaning and breathing rapidly] [floorboards creak] [continues moaning and breathing rapidly] [bang] [door hinges squeak] [water flowing] [heavy footsteps] [tense music] [door hinges squeak] [door closes] [Libby breathes deeply] [birds chirping] - [banging] - [Libby breathes deeply] [Michelle giggles and inhales] [John] Oh, I like things that are kind of wet. - Oh, yeah. - [John] Hm-mm. You're evil. [laughs] [indistinct]. What? [Michelle] [giggles] No, I didn't. [John chuckles] [giggles] Mm. Scratch my arm. Hm... mm. Mm-hm. - [far counter bangs] - Oh. [shocked] Morning, sunshine! Morning. How'd you sleep? Well, thanks. You want some breakfast? I was thinking we could go for a hike later? [chuckles] Mom? [Michelle] What? It's the 28th. Okay August 28th! Oh. [chuckles] We can go after breakfast. Can John come? Ahhh I-I don't know. Okay, fine. Just us two. [breathes deeply] I'll explain later. Hm. - It's fine. - [both kiss] [Michelle] I'm gonna make you some breakfast. - [both kiss] - You'll love it. [heavy footsteps] [birds chirping] So, what do you think of John? Mom. Ugh. It's important to me that you like him. [sighs deeply] [capsules clanking] I don't have anything this year. Fine. What about Grandpa? Mom! It's been nine years, Libs! So? Alright. I'm gonna go back to the house. Fine. You never gave a shit, anyways so... Hey! Hey, what? You never have anything nice for him. And one year, you gave him a roll of toilet paper! [laughs] That was funny! He was gassy! Just go play with your boyfriend. Hm. I think I will. No wonder he gave me the house. Excuse me? He gave you the house because he loved you! He loved you, Libby, more than he ever loved me. Yeah. That's kind of my point. No. No, Libby. You don't get it. He never loved me. You wanna know why I don't give him a note every year? You want to know why? Because after he died, and I was cleaning out this shithole house, I found his divorce agreement to Grandma. He wrote to the lawyers saying, "She can have Michelle, I'll take Marc." That. That was the last note. That was the only note. [heavy footsteps] [insects chirping] [gasps] Ow! Ow! [groans softly] [breathing deeply] [John] No. Stop! Stop! Stop! That's a Scolopendra! They're really rare! [gasps] Careful. Let's get back in there. Alright, come on. It bit me! Well, I would guess, ah It was protecting its offspring. There we... Sorry, I didn't know it was doing that. That's all right. [Libby breathes deeply] [John breathes deeply] Where did she get you? Right here. [John] Let me see. Whoa! I don't want to scare you, but their bite is venomous. Looks like you're gonna be okay. Just put some ice on it so it doesn't swell, okay? Okay. What were you doing out here? Um, I like to come out here after it rains. See if anything gets unearthed. [water splashing] You? Came to check on you, actually. Oh. Everything okay? Yeah. Fine. Hm-mm. I know it's not really my business, but, uh your Mom came back pretty upset. Oh. I hope it's nothing with me being here. Maybe I should take off. Our team's almost done around here. I can finish up at home. I don't want to cause a rift between you two. I know how much she loves you. [chuckles] You know, the way she described you, the way she talked about you it's what made me fall in love with her. You love her? Very, very much. Well, I'll be in the basement packing up my stuff. Oh, I have some of my things down there for the low light. Sorry, I should I should have told you. It's okay. You know, you should stay. I'll go talk to her. [John] Ah, I would maybe give her a little bit. Last I checked, she wasn't feeling real great. [loud whisper] Mom? [door hinges squeak] Ma? Hm-mm. [Michelle] I'm not drinking. I've been good this summer. I swear. [deep sigh] Hm. Ah. [breathes deeply] What's wrong? [Michelle] Ah. My stomach. Must've been my cooking. [chuckles] I'm sorry, about before. I didn't know, so It's okay, baby girl. I'm sorry I told you. I know Pop-pop meant a lot to you. This doesn't change that. Did you find anything cool? - Sort of. - [Michelle] Hm. You should show John! I think you two have a lot in common. [inhales deeply] Libs, there's something I got to tell you and I don't want you to freak out. Okay. Okay Ah, well John asked me to marry him, and I said "yes." [chuckles] Well, "hell, yes" to be exact. [chuckles] What? I love him, Libby. I love him so much. So, so much. He's amazing. And I know you'll love him too. I promise you will. It's important to me that you're okay with this. I need you to be okay, baby girl. [exhales] Please don't call me that. Okay. I'm happy for you guys. I love you, Mom. I want you to be happy. Oh, I love you, baby... I love you, Libs! Thank you, thank you, thank you. [inhales deeply] [chuckles] Just one more thing. Wh-what? John doesn't really know that I'm 42. What do you mean? He thinks I'm 35? Mom! That so... [Michelle] I know, I know, I know! I'm-I'm gonna tell him. I-I've been meaning to, just I-I can't lose him, Libs. I just, I can't. Hey, you won't. You're incredible, so [Michelle sighs] Hey I gotta... I should I should clean up. Yeah. - Yeah. - [Libby clears throat] [zipper screeching open] [Libby breathes deeply] [door hinges squeak] [John] Hello? [Libby] Ah. It's me. [John] Oh, hey! But, turn that light off, yeah, I'll-I'll come and get you. Hey, what an awesome surprise! I tried knocking. I'm really sorry. Oh, it's okay. I'll be, uh, the humidifiers, they get really loud, so sometimes I don't hear. How's your Mom? [gasps] She's fine. Yeah. [John] Good. Um, I brought you something to drink, so Thank you. Ah, I can't, uh, I can't do the sodium. Bad ticker. But thank you. Hm-mm. [whispers] Yeah. [John] So, uh you want to check out my craziness? Right this way. Come here. [water gurgling] Uhh. Uhh. What are those? [smirks] Lampreys. [Libby] Really? Yeah. You're familiar? Yeah. Slightly. I figured you might be. These little guys are 360 million years old. Right up your alley! Ah, yeah. They're, um mentioned a lot in the fossil record. Hm-mm. Yeah, these little guys have survived it all. Meteors ice ages ever increasing and decreasing salinity levels. In fact, they are the only aquatic species to be found in the fresh and saltwater records. Huh. They're parasitic. See the mouths? The teeth? They latch onto their prey. And they can adapt to their host. So, even if they encounter anadromous species like Smelt, or Salmon, or Bass, spawning in a freshwater pool, or stream, or river, they can attach and then adapt. So even if they end up in the sea they'll survive. No other species on Earth that can do that. Not one. [water bubbing] It's beautiful. Beautiful? Hm-mm. [chuckles] Yeah. You're kind of a-a weird dude. [John laughs] Yeah, I guess I am. But, I mean, weird is cool, right? Yeah. [Libby] Um So, I heard that you and my mom are getting married? Yeah, yeah. Ah She told you, huh? Yep. Yeah, we are. Libby, she's very, very special to me. Good. [John chuckles] We have to celebrate! You can have a party! You can invite some of your girlfriends. Ah, I don't... [chuckles] Maybe. [chuckles] Should I go check on your mom? Or-or... Nah, no, no. She's um, she's fine. Just let her sleep. [John] Okay. In that case you want to help me pull some samples from the lake? [water bubbling] Oh, okay. How old are you? [John] How old do I look? [Libby] Twenty-five. Ho-oh, thank you. [Libby] Twenty-six? Thirty. Oh. Where did you go to school? Uh, a little, private school that no one has ever heard of. It probably explains why I'm so well-funded. [boat groans] Can you hold my legs for a second? Yep. [John] Right there. [water splashing] Come on. - Yeah. - [cage thuds] Well, I'm applying Early Decision to Cambridge next year. Really? [Libby] Yeah, I got, uh, a perfect score on my PSATs and, um, my counselor says I'm probably gonna be Valedictorian, so Libby, that's amazing! Thanks. [chuckles] - Yeah. - Yeah. That's great. Yeah. It's-it's really far but, um, the archeology programs there are like the best in the world. - Yeah. - And like the history there is just so awesome. So Very awesome. Hm-mm, thanks. Does your mom know? Kind of holding off on that. She's so attached. [John] Right. - Yeah. - [John] Well Thank you. [giggles] Yeah, she wants me to stay here, but the state programs are so awful. Ahh! - [sudden splashing of water] - [tense music] [crow cawing] [tense music building up] [breathes deeply] I'm sorry. Are you kidding me? I'm sorry! I didn't want you to ruin your dress. And I-I just reacted. I didn't really know what to do. [Libby panting] Hey, hey, Libby, Libby. Listen it's okay! We're both scientists. Right? Hm-mm. This is totally normal. Look, it's it's no big deal. [tense music] You have a little red in your hair. [boat scrapes] [Libby breathing rapidly] Just chuck the shirt in the trash. [shower running] [knock on door] [John] Hey, Libby? Are you okay? [water dripping from shower] [John continues to knock] Libby? - Hey, Libby? - I'm in the shower. Thank you. Okay. Sorry. Just checking. [door closes] [dramatic music] [John inhales] [door squeaks open] [knocking on door] Mom? [knocks again] [doorknob rotates] [door hinges squeak] [tense music] [tense music building up] [Libby panting] [dry leaves rustling] [suspenseful music] [long beep, disturbance in line] [long beep] [keys clacking softly] [laptop keys clacking] [laptop keys clacking] - [laptop keys clacking] - [Libby breathes deeply] [soft knock on door] [door squeaks open] [door hinges squeak] [suspenseful music] Mm-mm. [exhales deeply] [suspenseful music slowly building up] [floorboards creaking] Mom! [knocking on door] Mom! [rattles doorknob] Mom! Mom, John just, uh... - [banging on door] - Mom? [breathing rapidly] [water lapping gently] [suspenseful music] [approaching footsteps] [water lapping gently] John? Libby? What are you doing out here? What are you doing out here? I don't know. I just woke up out here. Ah, I saw you! I saw you walk into the lake! - What? - Right here. I saw you walk into the Lake. Towards this like light! [scoffs] I'm-I'm pretty dry. What? Libby, I should have mentioned this earlier, and I'm really sorry. I suffer from somnambulism. It's sleepwalking. I'm really sorry if I scared you. I feel like everything that I have done since you got here has been an absolute catastrophe! I have this way of I just fuck everything up. Except for my research. It's the one time that I-I like I work. Does that make sense? Look, please, come back inside. I got to keep one of you healthy. I... [Libby breathes rapidly] [John exhales] Do you always lock the doors when you sleepwalk? [tense music] [Michelle] Libby? Libbbyyyy! Libby!!! Mom? [Michelle] Libby, in here! [Libby] Mom? What's wrong? Libby [breathes deeply] I need you to take the car, and go into town, and get me medicine. Okay? Something called cyclizine and Ginger Root. And whatever else. - Everything! - Mom, I can't drive! If somebody pulls you over, tell 'em it's an emergency. Well then, we-we need to call an ambulance! [Michelle] [labored breathing] Oh, God. It's not really an emergency. - What? - [Michelle] I Mom? I need you to also get me a pregnancy test. - [whispers] Mom! - Libby! Go! Please! [Libby] Why can't John do it? Because John's on one of his marathon jogs. He won't be back for hours. Please, just go, Libby. I need something. Marley's coming in an hour. I can just wait for her and then Uh, Marley's come... [groans in pain] Ahhh! Libs, please go. - Okay. - I'll look out for Marley. [groaning in pain] [cash register clicking] [tense music] [clerk] Excuse me, Miss? - Oh, sorry. - Sorry. Excuse me, Miss. You forgot to pay for that, young lady. [car doors close] Sorry. [suspenseful music] [car door closes] Hey! Hey! - Did you see? - Yep. Wow. Yeah, okay. [heavy footsteps] [John inhales] Excuse me. Okay. I got you everything you asked for. It's Ginger root, cyclizine, and, um, the and the, um Oh. It's okay, Libby. We talked. I know. [Michelle] Thanks, baby. Thanks, Libs. Do you need help getting to the bathroom? [Michelle] No, no. Not right now. John? [breathes deeply] I'll be alright. Go hang out with Marley. Maybe I should stay. [Michelle] No, I'm fine. John will take care of me. I think that I should stay. Lib! Please! Marley's downstairs. I'm tired. [Michelle breathes deeply] It's okay. I'll take care of her. Promise. [tense music] Go hang out with your friend. She looks fun. What? I got this! Don't worry! Use the card if you want to order something. Okay. [Michelle] Hm-mm. If you need me, just yell. Will do! [door hinges squeak] [tense music] [Marley chuckles and sighs] Don't say it. - Don't! - He's so hot. Oh, my God! - Eeeek! - Sshh. Is your mom okay? I don't know. She thinks that she is pregnant. Wait, what? - Momma-Dukes is preggo? - Hm-mm. Oh, smells! Okay, so you're going to have like a little brother or sister. Well, hopefully, not a little sister though. That'll be annoying. [gasps] Oh, a little boy though. He's gonna have like his thing - all over the place... - Marley! Although he'll probably be pretty cute. Filter. Right now. Yeah. Okay. - Sorry. I'm done. - [Libby sighs] So, tell me, why is John such a freak? [Libby breathes deeply] Okay. [whispers] So, last night, I saw him walk into the lake. Like completely towards this like, orange light at the bottom. Really? And I saw him drink his own sweat... Ewwww! [whispers] And he grabbed me. What? Like Donald Trump, he grabbed me. Jesus. Did you tell your mom? No! She's head-over-heels in love with him. Like psycho-girlfriend in love with him. Like [breathes deeply] Jaime-Savard in love with him. Oh, God. Okay. Still, you need to talk to her. Or call the cops! I know. Um hey, can you stay here tonight? Please. [inhales] Okay, I'm going to sound like the worst friend ever, but I can't. My Dad has this 'Behind the Book' charity event, and he has me working live stream 'cause he just can't get anything, right? But you should come. You need to get out of this house. No, I can't leave her alone. Okay, okay. Well, what if I go up there and tell Michelle? [whispers] I don't know. He didn't really grab me, but I was-I was bleeding. - Does that make me... - Okay, no, Libs. Fuck that. I'm gonna go tell her. [heavy footsteps] [sighs] Wait, he grabbed you while you were bleeding? [mouths] What the fuck! [heavy footsteps] Michelle? [mumbling] [Libby exhales] [child laughing on TV] Hm-mm. - [John] Mm. - [Michelle giggles] - [John chuckles] - Can you scratch my arm? - [John] Hm-mm. - [live chatter on TV] Where's Marley? - Oh, hey. - Hey. Marley left a while ago. And why didn't you wake me? - [Michelle] Well, we tried. - [John] Hm-mm. [Michelle] You were passed out. Are you feeling okay? I'm fine. You? [John] Go ahead. Mom? We're pregnant. [chuckles] Oh. Oh? Congrats? [Michelle exhales] Libby, I-I need you to be okay with this. [whispers] I'm really scared. [whispers] You're scared? Yeah. Did Marley talk to you? Yes! Why would you tell her that? What? He apologized. He just reacted. - It was a mistake! - Mom. No, Mommy! He licked it. - What? - He He licked it. Oh, God. I swear, every time, Liberty! What do you mean, every...? What... Every time? Every time I date someone, you come up with some BS. It was cute when you were a kid. But, not anymore! I'm done putting my life on hold for your feelings. John isn't going anywhere! - Really? - [Michelle] In fact, I think you should apologize. - No, no, no, no, no... - No, she should apologize! Babe, it's fine. Really. - Okay? - Hm-mm. Hm-mm. [John] If we're going to be a family, we have to learn how to forgive and forget. Right, Libs? [dramatic music] You're a freak. - Mom! Get off of him. - What? - Hey, okay. - Get off of him, now! Get off of him, now! - Get out of our house. Get out! - Libby! Stop it, Libs! [Michelle slaps Libby] [Libby breathing rapidly] [Michelle] Are you okay? - I'm fine. - I'm so sorry. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm so sorry. She's not 35, by the way. - Libby! - She's 42. So, sure hope you weren't planning on having another one. I-I meant to tell you. I'm I'm so sorry. John? Babe? Please say something. Babe? Babe? Please, don't be mad. Babe? Please. John! Let. Go. [Michelle breathing rapidly] Mom? [angrily] How dare you! He's not normal! Neither are we. No. That's not what I'm talking about. Then what are you talking about, Libs? [breathing rapidly] What is it? Does his sleepwalking bother you? His social anxiety? What? He's not perfect. [breathing rapidly] He-he loves me, after all. He loves me. [breathes deeply] By the way John told me about Cambridge. You wanna go? Then, we're selling this house. [breathes deeply] [heavy footsteps] [door hinges squeak] [thudding from upstairs] [floorboards creaking] [Libby breathes rapidly] [heavy footsteps] [door closes] [suspenseful music] [Libby breathes rapidly] [suspenseful music] [Libby breathes rapidly] [suspenseful music] [dull thuds] [eerie music] [Michelle] [screaming] Ahhhhh!
