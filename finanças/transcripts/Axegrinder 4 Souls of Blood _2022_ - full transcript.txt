- I can examine more of his blood. It's not going to tell me anything I don't know. - Maybe not. We've come at this from every way imaginable. - I'm not sure what else we can learn. - Maybe we should put him back in his environment. - That would come with risks. - He heals very rapidly. He uses a hundred percent of his strength. Humans typically tap out at 65%. He's a superhuman, the only one of his kind, we need to find out what makes his DNA different at any cost. - We have the woman who fought off a polar bear to save her son. And the woman who lifted a car to save her daughter. - Sounds like you like moms. - We have their DNA, Dr. Trask. - Those were isolated situations caused by life threatening circumstances. We cannot reproduce them in the lab, we have tried. - We could place cameras throughout the woods. Maybe we'll learn something from his environment. Maybe it's his surroundings that will secrete the uric acid purines that we can study. - This is Dr. Trask, prepare to deploy subject, Ax Grinder. - Wow, you know, a weekend in the woods, I was skeptical at first, but I think it's a great idea now. - Oh, it's gonna be a mega blast. - Do you have something in mind? - You'll find out. - You're naughty, aren't you? - You're naughty. - Guilty is charged. - I'm starting to think you had an ulterior motive for bringing me here. - Oh, you're starting to figure it out. - Tell me. - It's awkward, I don't wanna talk about it. But okay, you know how we've been best friends since we were little kids. - Yeah. - And we've been through some. Well, I wanna be more than just best friends. - What do you mean? - You know what I mean. - Maybe, but I'm not gonna make it easy for you. Catch me if you can. - Come on, I've got big plans for us. - Okay, you caught my interest. - Home sweet home, buddy. - Tell you what you gonna change yourself, all right. - There's all your stuff. - Let's get outta here, man. - Hold there. - Oh God, you scared the out of us. - From the looks of it, I scared the clothes off you as well. - Excuse me, can we help you with something? - Do you know about these here woods? - I know that people like to come to these woods to hook up in private. - These woods belong to him. - Oh, of course you would say that the woods are claimed by a man. - Yeah, haven't you heard of mother nature, she's not a man. - Consider yourself warned. - Warned about what? - Apricot, he was leaving. - Tell us, who are you gonna warn us about? - 15 years ago, Freddy Palmer went on a killing spree in these very woods. And then it all went quiet for a very long time. Some say that he's part of some sort of scientific experiment, but whatever the reason, he's back now, has been for a few years. And he's more dangerous than ever. He has no heart. He has no soul. He just kills and kills and he enjoys it. - Okay, we get it, crazy psycho killer with a knife. - It's not a knife. It's an ax. And he'll grind you with that ax. And he might even eat you. - Okay, we get the memo, bye. - Nice to see you. - What a creep. - Yeah. What if he was right about Freddie Palmer? - Definitely not. I mean, we would've totally heard about this on Twitter. - Let's go set up. - Run. - Freddy just killed two people. Are we really okay with this? - We're looking at an extension to life, the cure for every known major disease, cancer. It's a trade off. Are you not on board with this, Dr. Sanders? Because you were the one who suggested we returned him to his environment. What did you think was going to happen? - I don't know. I guess I just didn't really think it through. - Are you having second thoughts, Dr. Sanders? - No. - Are you sure? Should I be concerned? - No, not at all, Dr. Trask. - Good. - Judge Bias, I need to talk to you. - You don't have an appointment. - You ruled against me. - It was just yesterday, I remember. - Come on, we're neighbors. - You opened a band rehearsal center next to a mental health facility. You were bound to run into some issues. - You ruled that my bands can't play past 8:00 p.m. Most musicians don't even wake up until sundown. That's not even fair. - What do you hope to achieve by coming to my office without even appointment? - Oh, if I make an appointment, will that help? - No. - You know, no evidence was provided that our music has any effects on the nuts next door. - Really, the nuts? - Oh, the mental patients, whatever. - Judge Bias, I thought we had an appointment. - We do. Destiny here was just leaving. - Destiny. - Destiny's my name and managing band is my game. - Melinda Day, nice to meet you. - I'm not giving up on this. - Oh, I know you won't. - Are you sure that it's okay to meet now Judge Bias? - Yes, it's fine. And you know when no one's around, call me Sandy. I mean, we're friends, I've told you this a million times. - I'm here on an official request. So I was going more formal. - All right, what is it, Melinda? - Well, Sandy, you know the program I've been working on? - The one that puts criminals in the woods. - You know, no one gets rehabilitated sitting in a jail cell, right? I'm looking at working on them, fixing them with proven methods out in a camping environment, where they can become one with nature. - I love your passion, Mel, but have you really thought about this? - I'll only use non-violent criminals. We've talked about this. I thought I had your support. I'm ready to do this first trial. - I know what I said, but. - "The eyes of the Lord searched the whole earth in order to fully strengthen those "whose hearts are committed to him." - Are you using the Bible on me? Chronicles 16:9. - All right, okay, we'll do it. But I'm really going out on a limb here. So I get to pick the subjects. - You can't force them to volunteer? - No, but I can reduce their sentence by a year and they will jump at the chance. - I can't thank you enough, Sandy. - What does your sister think about all this? - You're not going out into the woods's for a week with a bunch of deranged criminals. - First of all, they're non-violent criminals, they're not deranged. - I'm not letting you do this, Melinda. - You can't stop me, Belinda. It's a great program. - You won't be safe. - "Submit yourselves therefore to God, "resist the devil and he'll flee from you." - Don't quote scripture to me. - There'll be a correction officer with me at all times. She's very strong. - A woman? - All four subjects will be woman. I won't be in any danger. - Right, because woman can't possibly be dangerous. You hear me, Lizzy Borden? - Lizzy Borden was never convicted of any crime. - I don't get you, Melinda. You say you believe in family support and then you take advice from some psychic over your own sister. - That's not true, Claire just offers a different take on things. - She belongs in a circus. She's a fake. - I think she's touched by God. - I'm coming with you on this trip, even if I have to take off work. - That's not an option. I'll be fine. I'm a hundred percent positive. Do you think I'll be safe on this trip, Claire? - I see a stranger, a dark stranger, a man. - I don't understand, a man? I'm only going on this trip with women. - The spirits need more rewards for more clarification. All right, I'm seeing more now. There's a strong woman fighting, she's fighting for her life. By a river, by a stream, is there a body of water involved? - Lakes, my corrections officer's name is Lakes. - Lakes is fighting for her life. - Is she fighting one of the test subjects. - Lakes is fighting a man a man with a mask on. That is all I can see for today. - Are you sure she was fighting someone? Maybe you picked up something else. - Can't you postpone this trip? - It's my life's mission. Everything I've done in my career has led me to this. - You better bring protection. - Protection. - Or someone else, someone else other than someone named Lakes. Who names their kid? After a body of water? - I'm not bringing a weapon, that's not who I am. - Well, then you better have a way out. - We're dropped off for a week, no contact with outside world. - Don't you think that sounds dangerous? - No, I think it's bold, innovative. I certainly wouldn't call it dangerous. - Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to actually press the button. I hope I never have to press the button. I'm sure I won't. So this is a remote device that can send a shock through the ankle monitors you're all wearing. There's a smart chip located in the strap, so please don't tamper with it. And this is Lakes. She'll be joining us this week as your corrections officer. And she'll explain more about the rules and the monitors. - I don't anticipate any trouble from any of you. But I'm more than qualified to deal with trouble if it appears. In addition to Melinda holding the switch that will trigger your ankle bracelets, it will also make a loud sound if you go outside the radius of five blocks of this location. - Five blocks? How are we supposed to know how far five blocks is in these disgusting woods? - The alarm will make a slight sound. Then a loud sound, if you pass five blocks. So you'll know. And if you don't make it back into the safety radius, within 30 seconds, you'll receive a shock 10 times as strong as the one Cassie felt in our demonstration. Should be enough to render any of you unconscious. Any questions? - I got a question. Did your parents really name you after a body of water, Lakes? Oh. - I forgot to mention, I also carry a shock button. - Oh, it's messed up. - What if we have to take these off for some reason? - If you try to take them off, you will receive the maximum shock. - We're out in the woods, what if something happens? - You can hear the traffic. We're not that far from the road. Melinda has a cell phone and I can get to the road in the case of an emergency. It's hard to get reception out here. But we don't anticipate any emergencies, so long as everyone cooperates. - So I think you'll all get the setup. So as long as you don't run away and everyone participates in the exercises, everything will be fine. - And we'll get a year off our sentence. - Yes. But what I really wanna do is to help you, all of you. - A year off our sentence is a good start. - Let's get situated with our sleeping situation and then we can start a first exercise. Follow me. "Here I am, I stand at the door and knock. "If someone hears my voice and answers the door, "then I'll come in and eat with that person "and they with me." Revelations 3:20. - It's scripture, she's quoting scripture. - She's quoting scriptures to a bunch of sinners, awesome. - Speak for yourself, I was framed. - Two of you will stay in the cabin with me. And two of you will stay in the tent outside. - I claim the cabin. - It's a reward system. So the two of you who do the best at the exercises each day, get to stay in the cabin at night. We'll begin our exercises inside. - Who are you? - Who are you? - Unhand me you ruffian. - Ruffian, dude's a good judge of character. - Nobody's been staying here. - It's owned by the state. We're gonna use it now and I have a permit. - All right, fine. If you have a permit, I'll be on my way, but you should too. - Why? - It's not safe in these woods? Freddy Palmer is back. He'll kill you all if you stay here. - Who's Freddy Palmer? - 15 years ago, Freddy Palmer killed a bunch of folks in this here woods. It all started with a young woman jogging through the woods. - Fuck you, asshole. Thank you, you saved my life. - What the fuck? - Who the fuck are you? Ah, fuck. - And then he killed them all. - No, no, no, this can't be the place, it can't be here. - It's the place where Freddy killed? - No, no it wasn't Freddy, it was one of the campers, some Blanche, my cousin was one of the victims. She drowned my cousin. I can't stay here. - Do you really wanna go, Jenna? - Yes, I'm freaking out. - Take a breath, a deep breath. Another one. If you need to go, we all must go and no one's gonna get any credit from this program or a reduced sentence. But if that's what you really want. - It's not what she really wants. - Jenna? - I think I'll be okay. - You won't be okay, you'll be dead. You'll all be dead. - You're not helping Mr. - Joe. - Joe, do you think it can give us a little space? We could really use our privacy. - If you don't leave right now, Joe, I'll kick your up and down these woods. - Lakes, I think you could handle this more appropriately. - Fine, I will go, but not because I'm afraid of this here goon. But remember, you'll all be. - All be killed, we got it. - All right. - Let's go inside. We could really get to know each other a little bit better. I want us to all share a little bit about ourselves. Why are we here? Who are we? I'll start. I'm Melinda, we can go by just first names here. I'm a social worker, as you know, and I look for the best and everyone. I'm very religious and I believe I'm here to do God's work. So who's next? - Remember the two who participate the most, get to spend the night in the cabin. - I go by Topper, I'm the top of my gang, well I was until I got busted. - What you get busted for? - It's none of your fucking business. - We don't curse here or make others feel uneasy, Topper. - Drugs. What did you think? - I'll go next. I don't wanna sleep in a tent. My name is Marilyn, I was falsely accused of blackmail, so I'm here. - Is that all you wanna share, Marilyn? - Probably. What about you, Jenna? Do you feel up to sharing yet? - Yeah. Jenna here, bank robbery. Well, I was just a lookout, no gun. So I qualified for the program. - You wanna tell us about your cousin? - She was like an older sister to me. She looked out for me. And if she was murdered in these woods, I don't know where, I mean, it wasn't something I wanted to ask. But if that crazy guy is right and it did happen here, I don't know, I mean, do I stay if it happened here? - It happened 15 years ago, right? - Yeah, I was just a kid. She made an impression. - Do you stab lingering feelings? - I don't know. I miss her sometimes, after all these years, is that weird? - No, not at all, Jenna. Is there anything else? - I don't think so. - I'm the whore, did you'll figure that out? - No need to be ashamed of sex work, Cassie. - Well, I shouldn't be in jail for it either. - I fully agree. And that's why by staying here a week, you'll serve no prison time. - I guess, as long as I don't get killed by a crazy guy with an ax, it will all be roses, right. - Joe, you need to be more careful. - We're gonna split up into two groups and do some hiking. In this exercise, I want you all to talk about what you would do differently in your life, if you could change one thing, just one thing, a redo. Marilyn and Topper, you'll go with Lakes and I'll get notes from her on what you talk about. The others come with me. - Pretty easy to see who'll be sleeping in the cabin tonight. - Anyone need to rest? - We can keep walking. - I'm good. - I think we should at least keep hydrated. Isn't it beautiful out here? - It's okay. - I think it's a perfect place to run through our next exercise. - If I could change anything, I would've talked my cousin out of her camping trip. You know, the one that got her killed. - That's an understandable thought, Jenna, but not very realistic. You couldn't have known that something was gonna happen to her on that camping trip. And you would still end up a bank robber. - The lookout, I was the lookout. - Come on, there must be something you could have changed. Maybe a relationship you could have avoided. - Kevin Tracks. I should have stayed clear from Tracks. I knew the second I met him, but never again. - He led you down a path of bad decisions. - Yeah. Yes, that's a hard yes. - So if you were to meet someone who might be a bad influence on you again. - I treat 'em like country music. - And this Tracks fellow, have you managed to get him completely out of your life? - Yeah. - Completely out? And there's no right or wrong answer. Either way, you get the year off your sentence. So just be honest with yourself. - Well, I would say he's not completely outta my life yet. - You're supposed to be sharing. Don't all talk at once. - How much longer do we need to hike? I'm getting sweaty, I hate that. - What the hell, Topper? Are you okay? - My ankle, I hurt my ankle, I don't think I can walk anymore. - Your ankle? You landed on your ass. - Well they both hurt. Do you wanna kiss it and make it better? - Are you telling me to kiss your ass? - And my ankle. - What were you thinking, Topper? Oh, hell no. I need to go look for her. Can you walk on your ankle? - I don't think so, but go look, I can wait here. I won't go anywhere, I promise. - Shit. - Topper, come back. This won't end well for you. - No, no please. Please. Please, no, no. - I can't find Topper. We gotta go find the others. - Oh, oh. I can't walk on this ankle. How about if I wait here in the shade until you sort this all out. - Earlier, it was your left ankle you hurt. - Oh, oh, well they both hurt. Ow, hey, this is police brutality. I'm gonna report you for this. - What about you, Cassie? What thing in your life would you change, if you could? - That's easy, everything. - I'm sure there's one thing. - I would trust people less. - That's good. Go on. - Well, I trusted that cop who busted me. I even asked him if he was a cop and he said, no. They have all these shootings and politicians sleep with whoever they want to me. I get arrested just one trick. It's not fair. - So you think you might trust your clients too much, how they represent themselves and you would change that? - Well, I didn't exactly have the greatest childhood. Took me a long time to learn to trust people. Never again. - Where'd you grow up? - I was born in Germany. I had a military family, moved around a lot, blah, blah. - Where's Topper? - I lost her. - And you couldn't hear her monitor. - I think she must have found a way to remove it or silence it or both. - No service. Let's go to the cabin. It's gonna get dark soon. I'll head towards the route. I know there's reception there and we can call in Topper's escape. We can spend the night here, but the judge might make us come back tomorrow. - Does that mean we spend 24 hours in these disgusting woods and still don't get a reduced sentence? - I don't know exactly what that means. I didn't expect for someone to escape on the first day. - Cassie and Jenna will spend the night in the cabin. Marilyn and I will spend the night in the tent. - This just keeps getting better and better. - So am I gonna be safe if we share the bed? - Well, unless you're pain me, I'm not touching you. - Sorry, I didn't mean to joke about. - About us sleeping in the same bed? Don't worry, I'm a funny whore. I mean, at least one with a sense of humor. Not like stand up, you know, I prefer laying down. All right, you are a bank robber with no sense of humor. - I'm not a robber. - Right, right, right, lookout. - This is stupid, guys are stupid, they suck. And I don't know why I listen to them. - You know, they do suck and not like a sex joke. I mean guys, they all suck. It's just a fact. - Yeah, I guess so. Did he see that? - What? - Something just past our window. - Maybe it was Lakes. - What even is up with her name, Lakes? - Do you want me to go check it out? - What if that crazy guy is right that there is some serial killer in the woods? - You don't believe that, do you? They caught your cousin's killer, right? - Yeah, I guess so. - I'll go check it out. - Okay. Be careful. - I'll be fine. I didn't find any crazed killer. - Not even a peeper. - Oh, I definitely wouldn't wanna meet a peeper who lives out here? I prefer my peepers to live in the city. - Thanks. I can probably sleep now. What? There's something you're not telling me. - No, it's nothing. - No, tell me. - I thought I saw something. - What? - Bigfoot. I mean, I probably imagined it, right? - Did you see it for long? - Just a second. - Was it dark? - Very dark. - Trust me, you didn't see Bigfoot. I hope. - Time we get some sleep. What? - What if we need to, you know, use a bathroom? - Look around, the bathroom surrounds you. - But what about number two? - You can do it anywhere, any number. - This just keeps getting worse and worse. - Just don't do it near the tents. - Okay, there's definitely someone here. - Okay, let's both look this time. - Bad feeling about this. - Hello there. - God, what are you doing? - Joe. - What the hell, Joe? - I just needed to warn ya. - You already did that. 15 years ago, some killer ran around the woods. We get it. - I didn't get a chance to tell you though. He's back. He's back here again, the last few years, killing a bunch of people out here. - What do you mean? - He's been killing kids and sheriffs too. - What you doing? - Oh, the best thing to do is split up and go back home. - That's a horrible idea. - Okay, I'm gonna go this way, you go that way. - Please, I'm an. - What the fuck is going on? What? - So you can see, he's back and he's killing. He's doing his killing again and again. - Joe, we are leaving tomorrow, okay. As soon as our leader gets someone to pick us up. - You don't have a way out of here, do you? - Usually I just walk down to town when I need to. But most of the time I live right here in these woods. - Well, we are walking out tomorrow. So thank you for your stories. But we need to get some sleep now. We promise we'll leave as soon as it's light out. - Good to hear that. Gratified that my stories might have swayed you, if they've done that. - Okay, goodnight. - Wait, if you see someone, can you tell them to call for help, let 'em know we're here. - I'll be seeing no one tonight. - Wait, wait, wait. Do you happen to own a Bigfoot costume? - Afraid not. Anything else? - Nope. Bye. - I'm really tired. - I know, I think we should be able to sleep now. God, I just hope he doesn't bother Lakes of Marilyn. - Lakes, no. - Oh not again. - The crazy old guy was right, there's a killer in the woods. He hacked up Lakes, it was awful. - We need to lock ourselves in here. Go, go, go, go. - There's no lock on the door. - Do you really think it's the best idea to lock ourselves in here? Shouldn't we make a run for it? - A run for what? - We can't get far with these ankle monitors on. - And it's dark out, we don't even know where to go. - I hope Melinda's able to call for help. I mean, we're supposed to get picked up tomorrow. - Okay, this is our best chance. We keep safe in here and maybe get picked up tomorrow. - I wonder if Topper really got away or if she got, you know. - They say that you're my brother, but I don't know I have a brother. - I don't understand. - I don't understand either. I only know what your mind tells me. - What does it tell you? - Our parents were horrible to you. Locked you up, beat you. But I was abandoned, raised by others. So I don't know I have a brother. - It's good that they left you for others. Do you love me? - I don't know. I've never met you. - Our father, he knew where you lived. He had photos. He followed you. But he never hurt you. - Freddy was busy last night. - I saw the footage. Seems like some pretty high profile kills, social worker, corrections officer. - We should get him pretty soon. I think we'll be able to study him more successfully now. - He stimulated, his DNA will be active. - Let's give him 24 hours more, finish what he started, no witnesses. We'll get him first thing tomorrow morning. I think we should stay here until someone comes for us. - We don't know if someone will come for us. I mean maybe Melinda, maybe something happened to her before we could make the call. - That psycho definitely killed her. - Well, if we try to get away, he'll kill us. You didn't see what I saw. - Do you think this door will hold or I mean, he won't get through the windows? - So it's a plan, Einstein. - We go near the tent. I'll make a distraction, while you two hide behind a tent. - It's three against one. - Yeah. - You want us to fight this freak? - You can surprise him. Hit him with a rock or a stick and then I'll grab the ax and I'll just kill the asshole. - You're crazy. - What, you have a better plan, say it now. - I'm in, I'll try it. If he's really the one who killed my cousin, I owe it to her. He's going down. - Come on, Marilyn, we need you. - Fine, let's try it. - Hey. Do you like my dance? I can sing too. - Go, go. Is he dead? It looks like it. Maybe you should kick him again. - It worked. You plan worked. - Okay now we walk so that our alarms go off. - I just wanna say that, well, I've always had things handed to me in life and it wasn't until I met the two of you that I realized what is important in life and that's pulling together. - We need a better plan. - What? We can't get away with these stupid bracelets on. - Then help me get mine off. - Stop, we'll get shocked in the process. - Then keep going until it's off. And when that's out, we can run for our life. Get it out, get out. - Cassie, Cassie. Cassie, wake up. At least it's off. You have to make a run for it. Go that way, go, go, go. - You need to come too. - I don't have time to take my bracelet off. You get help and come back for me. Go, go now, go. No, no, no, please stop, no. No, no, no. Come on, come on, come on. No, no, no, please no, please no. Only one left, then no more witnesses. - When do you wanna retrieve him? - We can do that any time. I'm sure he'll be done by the time we arrive. - I see that the final living subject is Cassie Johnson. She was a prostitute. She might be very resourceful. Perhaps we should wait until he's finished with her. - Do you have a fondness for whores, Dr. Sanders? - Why do you ask that? Now I didn't say I wanna meet her, I said we should wait until she's dead. - Is that how you like your whores? You like them when they're dead. That's how you like to play with them. - That is completely inappropriate, Dr. Trask. - Do strong women threaten you Dr. Sanders? Is that why you prefer them to be dead? - I don't like this line of inquiry at all. - You need to relax Dr. Sanders. We've known each other for a long time. You need to have some fun. We can go get 'em right now, I'll make sure the whore doesn't bother you. I'll see to it personally. Jones prepare the van and Smith come in now, I know you're right outside the door. Smith, I'll be accompanying you to the woods, all right. - Yes, Dr. Trask. - You know, I like that you chose the name Smith. It's not your real name, I know that. It shows me though that you're a man of simple means. Am I right? - Dr. Trask, this is making me uncomfortable. - She does that to everybody. - Do you like my legs, Smith? - I don't know, I guess so, yeah. - Is that why you position yourself right outside the door? - Oh, no, no, no Doctor. - Then are you a spy, listening to our experiments, reporting back to someone? - No Dr. Trask. - Then why do you wait right outside the door? Because Jones doesn't do it. It has to be about my legs, come on. - Oh, okay, I like your legs. I mean, I like you, you're attractive Dr. Trask, I'm sorry. - You are very, very sorry. Now go get the van ready. - Yes, Dr. Trask. - For Freddy. - I don't usually take clients this early. - Do you know who I am? - I wouldn't be much of a psychic if I didn't know who you are. I know your face, Melinda, Belinda. - I'm not like my sister, you can't con me. - So then why are you here? - If you're psychic, you know why I'm here. - Is it to gimme your cousin Tiffany's number? She's a real hoochie coochie. - Oh, what a waste of time. - Sit. I know you're worried about your sister. Believe it or not, she's my friend too. - She had a lot of faith in you. - And you don't have faith in much of anything, do you? Except your sister. - So what do I do? - You need to go find her fast. - Okay, I will. - You haven't heard from her? - No, her signal's getting weaker. - Do I owe you something? - I'll settle for your cousin Tiffany's phone number. - Why? - Well, she's cute and the true reason I cannot say. - Okay, I'll text you her number. I'm worried about Melinda. She said she'd call at 9:00 a.m. every morning to check in. - Have you tried calling her? - Yes, no response. - I tried calling her too, but maybe she doesn't have a reception where she's at. - I have a bad feeling. - Have you been speaking to your sister's so-called psychic? - I don't believe in that crap either. Something's telling me something is wrong. - So you haven't gone to see her psychic. - I did. Come on, just tell me where the rah, rah, get outta jail free group is and I'll go check them out myself. - Okay, well that wouldn't be appropriate. And they don't get outta jail free, okay, one year off their sentence. - Melinda can make us believe in anything, can't she? - She gives you hope when there just isn't any. - Come on, doesn't your gut tell you that something went wrong? Her and one other officer against four criminals. - Nonviolent criminals. - I'm not leaving until you do something. - You're just as stubborn as she is. Fine, I'll call the park ranger to go check things out. - Park Ranger Amanda Briggs, identify yourself. - I'm so glad to see you. I need to help everyone is dead. - Who's dead? Identify yourself. - I couldn't stop him, he's a psycho. - You need to relax and identify yourself. - How do you want me to relax, if you're pointing a taser at me and a killer could come out in literally any minute. - Sit on the ground now and put your hands behind your back. - Why won't you listen to me. - Now. Now, what's your name? - Cassie Johnson. I'm part of that test group. - The one with the prisoners, camping for the week. - Yes. Melinda was our leader and one of us got away or who knows, maybe got killed. And then Melinda went to call for help. She couldn't give reception at the camp. - Did you hear from Melinda after she left? - No, some crazy guys showed up in a mask and he killed Lakes and then he killed Marilyn and probably killed Jenna too. - Was that the rest of the prisoners? - Everyone got killed. And we need to get outta here before he finds us. - Is that blood on your shoe? - I hit him with an ax. - Did you kill him? - No. He got up and killed Marilyn right after, and then he followed us to the camp and my guess is, killed Jenna there as well. - I'll call for backup. Hi Judge Bias, I'm near the campsite now. - Did she find Melinda? - No, just someone named Cassie Johnson. - She's one of the subjects. Does she know where Melinda is? - She says that when one of the prisoners tried to escape, that Melinda went to call for help. They don't get cell reception near of the camp. And Judge, the prisoner says that someone has tried to kill everyone else. - Jesus. Well go check it out. - I was just about to call for backup. - I'll call for your backup. Go investigate the camp, don't wait. - But Judge, that's not procedure. - If Melinda is in danger, she needs to be found, go now. - But Ma'am. - You owe me a favor, do you not? - If Melinda's in there, I'll find her. - What are you doing? - Show me the bodies. - But we can't go back there. - I could always tase you in the leg and go look myself. - Can you uncuff me at least? - Just keep walking. - No, I can't walk with my hands behind my back. - Let 'em in front. - No, come on. - Do it. - Are you into bondage, Ranger Ricks? I'll let you do anything, if you let my hands go free. - Just keep walking. - Ah, seriously, I can't walk with these handcuffs on. Like, have you ever tried it? - Get up. - No, I'm staying down here unless you wanna explain why you tased an unarmed handcuffed hooker. - Just remember, I have a weapon. No shenanigans. - Shenanigans wow. It's like you read too many 1960s comic books. This is where Lakes was. - No sign of a struggle here, no sign of a death. - Well, I didn't see what happened to Lakes here. Marilyn just told us that she saw her killed. - What did you actually witness yourself? - I saw him kill Marilyn, it was right here where we're standing. - How was she killed? - It was an ax. - The same one you used on him? - Yes, I guess I must have set it down after we thought he was dead. - Does look like a body might have been dragged from here. - Yeah, he dragged the bodies away and, God he doesn't pleasure himself with the bodies, that's disgusting. - Some killers are cannibals. - Oh, oh that's worse. - You said there was another killing. Where did that happen? - Probably at the cabin. - Show me. - Okay, be ready, in case he's in here. - Just walk in, I know what I'm doing. - He must have taken all the bodies away. - Would you like to confess anything? - Come on, just think about it. Do I look like someone who would hurt anyone? - What's down the hall? - The bedroom. - Show me. - Go look at it yourself, Ranger Rick. - Stop calling me that. Go. - Jesus. Fine. - Put your hands behind your back. - Oh, come, you don't think I did this, do you? - Now. - This is Ranger Briggs, I found the body of Melinda Day, she's been murdered. I'm at the Cabin at Stones Creek. I have one suspect in custody. - Come in. Have a seat. - It's bad news, isn't it? - I'm afraid so. - Just say it, Melinda's dead, isn't she? - She was murdered. - Why'd you ever let them try that fucking experiment? - I'm so sorry. - You know it's painful. I should never let her try it. - No, it's not your fault, Belinda. Look, it was her program, okay. It was her passion, she wanted to do this. You know her, you know what she was about. - What happened? - I don't really know right now. It looks like one of the subjects. - You mean one of the prisoners? - One of the prisoners escaped, Melinda went to go find reception. One of the other prisoners got their ankle monitor off and killed some of the other prisoners. - And Melinda? - Apparently so. - So what happens to the prisoner now? - I'm not quite sure. She was a non-violent prisoner and she just snapped. - So insanity, plea? - Possibly. But I just think there's more to this story than we know right now. - Freddy. Where are you at, Freddy boy? Are you out here, Freddy? Looking high and low for you today. - Think we gave him enough, Doc? - Yeah, that's enough to put out an elephant. - What if it's not enough? - You worry too much, Smith. - Time to go home, Freddy. - You can leave us. Hello Cassie. I'm judge Sandy Bias. - And I'm the queen of England. - I'm hoping that you'll tell me what happened at the camp. - I already told everyone, who wouldn't listen. Freddie Palmer the psycho, killed everyone, except for me. The only one who got away. - They found Melinda's body, and she was a friend of mine. - Yeah, I don't know what he did with the other bodies. - Your defense attorney is a public defender whose case rests on convincing a jury that Lakes was in on it, that she freed the prisoners and one of them killed Melinda. But that's just speculation. - Yeah, I'm not going to lie about that story. I already told the PD that. It was Freddy Palmer. - Freddy Palmer is a myth. It's like Bigfoot. You're gonna argue that Bigfoot killed everyone? - Well, if Bigfoot did it, then yes, I would. In fact, I actually thought I saw Bigfoot at one point near the cabin. - Do you know how crazy that sounds? - Well, it wasn't Bigfoot okay. It was Freddy Palmer who did the killing. Just forget about Bigfoot, God. - The murder weapon was found. The ax that killed Melinda has your DNA on it. - Yeah, I used the ax to kill Freddy. - Then where's Freddy's body? - He didn't die, okay. We just thought I killed him. - So you imagined it? - I know what you're trying to do, all right. And it won't work. - I'm just trying to get to the truth. I have a hard time believing that you killed everyone by yourself and hid all the bodies so well that they can't be found. - Right, and no jury will believe that. - I don't believe you killed Melinda. Her blood was found on you. - Yeah, she fell on me. Ranger Rick saw that. - Your DNA is on the murder weapon. Melinda's blood is on you and you had a motive. So why don't you let me help you. - I am done talking to you, okay, you can talk to my crappy public defender if you got anything else to say. - I think he needs another sedative, Dr. Sanders. And then we'll extract the uric purines from his liver. - No. - Freddy speaks. Did you know he could speak? - I did not. - Freddy, do you have anything to say before we gather this generous donation, your body for the advancement of science? - Let me go or I'll kill you slowly. - Sedative, please. There, there, get a good sleep now, Freddy. - I'll kill you, I'll make it hurt. - Do you enjoy killing Freddy? What's happening here is your redemption, ours too, for all the terrible things we've done. But the world will be a better place with your blood and DNA. - If I sleep, even for a moment, I'll wake up stronger. And snap your neck. - Now Dr. Trask? - One moment. Sweet dreams dark prince. You may continue. Still rolling. Five minutes left and action. - Go. - Fine, Jesus. Sorry I didn't mean to. I'm still rolling. Okay I got it. Were you making faces at her? Yeah, inside joke. - What about you Cassie? - Cassie and Jenna will spend the night in the tent. Marilyn and I. Oh. - Yeah. - Sorry. - I'm sorry. - I was gonna get excited, but then I'm like no it's not. - Should I just take it from my line? - Yeah, take. - Would we? 448, 440, take one. Are you rolling? I'm rolling. - Wait, can we? That was so fast. - Yeah, we weren't, hold on, I was not ready. Do the second kick. - Woo. - Oh. Oops. - Try it again. Now one more. - Did it move? Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, I guess it's a butterfly. - It's 'cause it's long one.
