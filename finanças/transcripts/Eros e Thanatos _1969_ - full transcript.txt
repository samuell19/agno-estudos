The unleashed eros is equally fatal to its antagonist, the death instinct. - Come here, sit down. - The photographs? There's time for the photographs. How come you never stopped before? Are you shy? - I hated you. - Not like that, stupid! - What do you mean you hated me? - I hated you, you and your cheeky face. You parade yourself on the street, and you're just a girl. A child whore. That's why I hated you. But you changed your mind. It fits perfectly in one hand. And they still haven't managed to ruin them yet. And you won't either. No! Not like that! That's better. I like that. Beautiful. You're so smooth against the tree. Rough and smooth. Your hands are so cold. Beautiful, beautiful! Nude, tied to the tree. - I want to photograph you like this. - The photographs later. - And they'll cost extra. - Yes, but nude. Not here. It's cold. Come, I know where. Come. Close the door. This okay? Take it off. Hurry up with the report and get her off of there. Photographer. - Is he the one who found her? - Yes, sir. Yes, I did... But I don't know anything! Calm down, kid. No one here's accusing you. - Tell me what happened? - Yes. I was passing by and you know how it is, I came in... and I saw her there, all covered in blood, tied up. THE KILLER LEFT THEIR SIGNATURE - It's him - say the police, but the accused denies it. Franco Adami Formally Charged 'Lawyer D'Orazi to defend Franco Adami' - You know who I'd send to prison? This idiot journalist here. "These poor girls get killed and lawyers defend them for free" I need to eat, the big lawyers can afford the expenses. Not me. Anyway, he's got it all wrong. That kid's alibi doesn't hold up. The newspaper's right. "It's necessary to teach a lesson" Listen to what they say. "They must pay for their crimes" "For each one that gets away with it, ten criminals find courage" "It's time to set an example" "To restore law and order to a province that was once a model of law and order" Very well written. Who wrote that? Let me see. He's good. Giorgio Tavani. It had to be him. He writes how he talks. I wish he'd just leave the page blank. People like this poor kid, they're sick, real sick. Yes? Well that poor girl is dead. And that other one, two years ago? With the truck drivers. They got away with it. Don't make me laugh. You think this one's crazy? Get out of here! If he's crazy then we're all crazy. - Indeed, we're all a little crazy. - Yes? - We were a bit crazy in bed earlier. - That has nothing to do with it. If you're trying to say we're all dirty, that's a different story. It's the same thing, Princess. Crazy, dirty... For five minutes the brain takes a walk. Then you come back to normal, but not everyone. It's like a set of scales. Over here, sex, animal aggression, death. Over here, survival instinct, reason, love. A bit here, a bit there. But if the scales break. The face never changes, but the scales are broken inside. Beyond repair. Of all the circumstantial trials... This is the most circumstantial of trials. The testimonies that you jurors have heard in this courtroom... have demolished, one by one, the pillars of the prosecution's case. Franco Adami's alibi leaves no room for doubt. It's true, Adami, in the first instance... Unaware the police had found his belt at the scene of the crime... Denied ever having met Mirella. This, according to the prosecution... The clue of clues! Mirella. Who knew her? No one. Only two people turned up to identify her. An elderly couple who were putting her up. And also... How many people have stopped at that crossroad... and whiled away some time with that lady of the night? I'm not here to moralise. I know all about human weaknesses. Even in the most respectable people. Most above suspicion! I would like for a moment, people of the jury. That in your place there were lots of respectable people from this city. The jealous keepers of certain personal secrets. They would never accept that this pitiful youth's lie... Promptly retracted, I should add. Would be enough to condemn him for his entire life! The very same necroscopy in the police's forensics report... is the biggest flaw in the prosecution's case. According to the necroscopy, the girl died between nine and twelve. But that was precisely the time when the girl saw most of her clients. Adami met her in the afternoon. At least four witnesses saw him returning to the village before sunset. Franco Adami is innocent! If we weren't absolutely certain... We wouldn't have refused a psychiatric evaluation for our client. But you know, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Asking for a psychiatric evaluation for a perfectly normal youth... Actually, exceptionally well-balanced, like Franco Adami... Means standing alongside the prosecution. Admitting the slightest suspicion of guilt. The accused refused! And the defence stands by his refusal. The clear reason of Franco Adami appeals to your clear conscience. People of the jury. Nor will we settle for an acquittal due to lack of evidence. Franco Adami, unlike the conservative press... which has already reached its verdict before this court... Evidently for politically motivated reasons. He is innocent! In the Adami case, we challenge certain police methods... And the press, which we won't hesitate to call instruments of a de facto justice. This newspaper's got some nerve. They're risking a nice lawsuit. What do you think, lawyer? Isn't it strange, a key witness turning up at the last minute? What's so strange? He's guilty as sin! - She's right. - Make an example of him. - You want to hang him, Maria? - Sure. Maybe the newspaper can provide the rope. He'll get away with it. The defence lawyer already has the jury in his pocket. - I don't think so. - No? - Lawyer D'Orazi hasn't got a clue. - D'Orazi hasn't got a clue? A lawyer like him? I'm telling you, he hasn't got a clue. They used to defend people like that in my grandfather's times. Put it on my tab. I didn't come forward before because it was all going so well. The police had caught him. I didn't want to come here and put myself in the spotlight. But then, when I saw that muderer over there... was going to get away with it because of a lack of evidence. So I said to myself, sure, spying on couples like I do isn't nice... but killing them is something else. So I decided to tell the newspaper editor everything. Mr. Tavani. And Mr. Tavani told me I have to talk to a lawyer. - Right? - Sure. I didn't want to, your honour. I don't like being in the spotlight. Have you received any money from the newspaper? What are you talking about? It was a matter of... What do you call it? Conscience! Then tell us the facts in order, and please be very clear. - I was hiding not far from the cabin. - Speak up! I go there sometimes because I like to watch. Good. Then I saw them going in and I followed them. They made love. I noticed he was getting a bit restless. I don't think he could get it up. And then he started taking photos of her. Like this now. With your arms up. It's more artistic. He took lots of them, in various poses. I thought he worked for one of those magazines. Now, like this. Smile. Now we'll add an effect. With a bit of blood. What are you doing? Stop! I just froze. Then I got scared, real scared. And I ran off. It's him, your honour. He killed that poor girl! It was him! - No. - Finally! Key witness topples Franco Adami's defence. No, it's not true! - It wasn't me. - Calm down. I want to help you but you've got to help me, tell me the truth. You know no one wanted to defend you. But I accepted to save you. You understand? No, no... Listen to me. Listen to me. I know you didn't do it. It was someone. Something that's inside of you. Who knows how long it's been there? But you mustn't think of me as a lawyer, you must think of me as a father. - I've never had a father. - I know. I've been following your trial. Your mother also left you when you were young. You were thirteen. And you couldn't tell anyone what you feel inside. But you didn't want to hurt that poor girl. That thing inside of you woke up when you saw her naked, tied up. It wasn't your hand that struck her, it was the other guy. It wasn't her you were attacking, it was the other guy, right? You wanted to kill that monster that torments you. Which perhaps some other time... Say it. Confess. Open up your soul. You have a father to talk to. You have someone. And confessing is the only way you'll save yourself. You're sick. How can they condemn someone who's sick? - It wasn't me. - Indeed, you didn't want to kill her. You just wanted to see the blood. The blood. You can't do it if you don't see blood. The blood! When I saw she wasn't waking up, I ran away. So she bled to death. And you were already in the village when she died. But how did you know what the other guy had done? - I bet you even slept well that night. - Yes. - What did you do with the photos? - I destroyed them, the day after. When I heard the police were looking for me. - Did you look at them? - No! I burnt the negatives. So you cleaned house. You're a good kid, Franco. It's the other guy that's terrible. We've got to chase this evil away, with his blood. The blood! It all started with the blood. My mother had just died. And I was working in a small hotel in the mountains. I used to always go and spy on the hotel slaughterhouse. It was stronger than me. One day Giulio caught me. He was the hotel waiter. He was always hovering around me. Like he wanted to be my friend. What are you looking at? Nothing. The butcher. Do you like watching them kill the animals? There were some good times in my life. I'd forgotten about the blood. But then... Tell me. You need to get it out. You didn't do those things, it was the other one. Sometimes I even tortured animals. But I liked animals. But it was stronger than me, seeing the blood. Remembering those sensations, reliving certain moments. I've read it, your honour, it's a real masterpiece of sarcasm. I don't give a damn about what you write about me. I like a drink or two, so what? Everyone likes a drink, including you. Sorry to disappoint you but I don't drink. I should have known. That explains a lot. Former parachutist, conservative, teetotal! This doesn't stop me from having some fine cognac. If you like? Well, a drop. Just to show you I'm not upset. Please. - It's sad drinking alone. - We'll be sad together. It's good. You're not the only who's been talking about me in this city. But your insinuations don't hurt me. They're hurting that poor kid. He's sick. Sick? He's a sadistic murderer. Murderers are almost always sick. Especially in cases like ours. Irresponsibility or social responsibility? Listening to you, we should open all the prisons. Hell no! Prisons, murderers, lawyers... That's what increases the paper's circulation. How many more copies will you sell covering this trial? Get to the point. What do you want? I'm wondering what you want? You talk about rights and science, but have you ever studied medicine? - Are you interested in psychoanalysis? - Psychoanalysis? An alibi for debauchery? To break every social restraint? I'm aware of your political views. The total destruction of middle-class taboos. - You're ignorant. - How dare you? You're ignorant and don't know what you're doing. But what do you care if some 22-year-old kid gets a life sentence? The girl he killed was 17 Have you ever been inside a criminal asylum? A visit might make you see sense. Why don't you come to St. Anselmo with me? A half hour drive. There are people in there who seem completely normal. No less normal than Franco Adami. Yet they're crazy. I think you've also got a conscience. Everyone says you're an honest man. An officer, decorated. An election candidate, but an honest man. You're entitled to your beliefs, but the newspaper? - It's a terrifying tool in your hands. - Listen here... Your hundred thousand copies hammer out public opinion. The jurors read your articles. You strike every day, hammering it into them. As if you were in council chambers. I see it all the time! - What are you getting at? - I told you. I want you to come with me, then write whatever you want. A visit to a criminal asylum will convince you that society is unfair. That the law is wrong. We're still in the dark ages. If someone has a bad heart or liver, society intervenes. Social care, free cures. But if their illness is here, if it's inside and you can't see it. If microscopes can't spot the bacteria. Then the illness isn't cured, it's punished. - The patient is beaten down. - Franco Adami has killed. Everyone kills. Not just the sick, and the sane. The tuberculosis and encephalitis sufferers we treat in hospital. They've already spread their illness. A baby can kill their mother in childbirth. The rich can kill the poor. Whoever governs can kill with an almighty war. A woman sometimes kills the man they say they love. I know what you're up to. You want the paper on your side in order to get public opinion behind you. Neutral, at least. I have every right. So you want me as an ally? And you say it like that, openly, to my face. - Not even D'Orazi tried that. - He hasn't got a damned clue. He maintained his innocence. You just have to look in that poor kid's eyes. But you've got to know how to read him, he's a killer. - Precisely. - And he's a killer because he's sick. - He's crazy! - If he's crazy then we're all crazy. I've heard that before, but from someone who wasn't too smart. Sorry, I'm busy now. You really don't get it. I'm not asking for him to be acquitted. I just want to spare him a life sentence. Do you know what a life sentence is? It's much worse than a death sentence. And that kid wouldn't last, I'm sure of it. His mind is too fragile. He'd find a way to kill himself. Don't trouble yourself. I see we have nothing more to say. You do your talking in court, I do mine here! What gives you the right to decide a man's fate? Show him out. Listen, I've got my own score to settle with God. But you who claim to be a catholic should act on your conscience. Someone like me, God won't pay much attention. But someone like you, he'll be watching. - News desk? - Yes? - Send Barney to me. - Right away. What do you know about lawyer Montani? He seems half crazy to me. Or better, a protester, even if he hasn't got long hair. He's not from here, he's from Carrara, the land of anarchists. He used to be a respected lawyer before he started drinking. Now he lives on the fringes of the courthouse, he collects the crumbs. - Does he have any family? - No, I don't think so. But he likes the ladies. He lives with a nightclub dancer. I'd like to know more about this man. Where he comes from. His past. - How much? - 750 Wait. Be careful or you'll fall. The telephone! Who the hell's calling at this hour? It's probably for you, asking for seconds! Very funny! What am I doing with you? Love is blind, abnormal, paralytic and drunk! Drunk, right! Who the hell is it? Come and open the door. Come on. Hello? Who's speaking? The nightclub manager? No, Ren?e doesn't do seconds! Newspaper? What newspaper? The newspaper editor? I'm sorry, Mr. Tavani! Yes, it's me, lawyer Montani. There was some intereference. No, there's no session tomorrow. The trial resumes on Monday. What? I'm really glad you called me! Thank you very much. Okay, okay, goodnight! Who was that? Good news, princess. - A tango? - You're crazy! What woke you up? Yes, princess, I'm wide awake! Criminal Asylum I'm lawyer Montani, we have an appointment with the warden. Let's go, Tavani. Good morning, lawyer. Good morning. Please, follow me. A little visit every now and then is good for the law and also the press. When we examine the inner psychology of our patients... we must always take two fundamental factors into account. Factors we have defined with the Greek names, Eros and Thanatos. That is, love and death. Of course, by love and death we mean the ultimate tendency. In the first, Eros... That is, love. We find all those manifestations which lead to reciprocal attraction. To the union, and then procreation. But this path is no bed of roses. Because, if it's true that all sublimated feelings depend on it. Like friendship, affection, sympathy, enthusiasm and devotion. But they also depend on the most primitive erotic manifestations. From a child's primordial urges in their early years. To boys' solitary habits, to unfulfilled desires. To everything, in short, which satisfies their ultimate desires. That is, the approach and the union. Which reach their culmination in the physical union of the sexes. The second source of impulses is the aggressive tendency, destructive. This inspires negative affections and feelings like antipathy... aversion, malice, hatred, rage. We call it thanatos, instinct of death. But death only as a distant goal. Along its path, there is separation and destruction. It's a mistake. It's a serious mistake in children's early education... to keep this tendecy repressed inside. In fact, from eros we tend to cultivate kindness, friendship, goodwill. And to repress its other aspect, which is also natural... Sexuality. Thanatos, that is, the destructive instinct... Tends to be glorified in depictions of heroism, wars, and sporting achievments. And to repress it in its own manifestations, which are also natural. Such as a child's aggression. Their biological egotism. All repressions, be they conscious or subconscious, collide. All the traumas we suffer tend to crystalise in our character. They become a permanent asset. One of the tenets of neuropsychology is the so-called compulsion to repeat. A tendency to recreate the psychological conditions of one's childhood. Now, if you'd care to follow me. - This way. - Good morning, warden. I'll show you a typical case of compulsion to repeat. A person who will seem completely normal to you. And yet he has no hope of being cured. At the time, the press dubbed him 'the doll lunatic' - Yes, I remember. - Precisely. We're sure that if he was ever released he'd repeat his crimes. Not even the threat of death would stop him. In a subject like this, the eros and thanatos instincts are so closely tied... that deep inside, this chastisement and self-destruction... become the pivotal trigger which pushes them to murder. In other words, they kill and destroy what they love... on the condition that they will be killed and destroyed in turn. Good morning. At ease. Here's our Mr. Usai. How are you? Fine, I had a headache this morning but it's gone. They gave me a pill in the infirmary. - What are you making? - Drawings of the staff. Good, good. - You can sit down. - Thank you. This gentleman's a journalist, he wrote about you last year. A journalist! Which newspaper? Mr. Tavani edits the local newspaper. - You read it sometimes, right? - Not really, just the gossip. I like reading the city gossip. And the cinema! I like to know what's playing at the cinema. This gentleman's going into the city in a few days, he could be of some use. Great! Can I give him a letter? Sure, give him the letter. - If it's not too much? - No. It's a project for the society for the re-education of single mothers. The chairwoman is a friend of mine. I don't know if you know her? Countess Sandrelli. A lady, a real lady! Incredibly wealthy, I'm hoping she'll cooperate with the institute. These gentlemen don't know about your institute, you should explain. It doesn't matter, as long as she gets the letter. When I'm discharged from this hospital, then I'll see my dream realised! The Francesca Catoni orphanage. I would have already done it, if I hadn't fallen victim to that vicious slander. Sure. In any case, if they could locate little Francesca... she'd immediately tell the truth. She's so obedient. She's so good. But they won't let her come back. I feel sorry for her father. It crushes my heart when I think of him. - Have you ever met him, sir? - No, I don't think so. He's a good man. I don't know what got into him. He was unrecognisable in court. I looked at him, and I asked myself, is that really him? Memmo Catoni, the joker. The life and soul of the market. Check out these apples! Come on, ladies and gents! You won't believe our prices! Hold on, lady, look at what I've got for you! Bananas! It's the tenth time you've been back! You've got to stop! It's twice as much now with all the interest! I'm not paying it! You damned loanshark! Calm down, the accountant's a good man unless proven otherwise! - Don't worry. - With that damned interest? It's the fifth time he's put it off, I can't pay the interest for him. Those people are ignorant! Just ignore them. - Have you got your fruit? - No. - Give him something! - What do you want? I'll see you tomorrow. - Hi, Mum. - You're back early? We finished earlier today. My maths teacher is sick. Accountant. Hello, Francesca. Stop hanging around. Go home. I was just there. Grandma wouldn't even let me in. She's run out of oil and she didn't have any money. Get it from your father. Memmo, the till. Here, now go home. Grandma! It's me. At last! What took you so long? - What did you get me? - Nothing. Good morning, accountant! Good morning, Adele. Where are you going? Come here! - Hello, Tonino! - Sorry! Not at all, my dear. I've got something for you. For you and for Francesca. - Come on, let's go. - No. - You've got to eat. - I don't want to. I'm not hungry. No one knew exactly who Usai was, or where he came from. He lead a very reserved life. Even the police found it difficult to collect any information. He was always good to me. He'd been here a few years. He used to live in the centre. He was a widow. He once told me that his wife died when she was ninteteen. Such a long time ago? I was surprised. Then he explained that they married when she was sixteen. - Did anyone ever visit him? - Sometimes, but mostly neighbours. He was very kind. Always willing to help. I used to clean his place once a week. He had two or three other girls do some cleaning as well. The little hussies! Now I think about it, maybe he chose them on purpose. Slowly, slowly, his image of her had transformed into an idol. Into an obsession. - Stop it, Tonino! - No! Enough! Come down! I want to try! Get off! I want to try! Accountant! Excuse me, accountant. What's the square root of 728? You're still studying? I thought you went to sleep a while ago! No way, I've got to do my maths homework. Dad got upset when he saw my grades today. - So they've all gone to the cinema. - And your grandmother? Daddy took her on purpose to spite me. - Have you got a little problem? - I wish it was just one. I've got three to do. Come here and show me, I'll help you. I'll be right over! - Excuse me, accountant. - Not at all, come in, my dear! Come, dear. I was just having a snack. - Can I help you? - No, it's all done. This here. Let's see. A barrel maker has to fill five barrels, each with a total capacity of 47 litres. Sit down, dear. Well, let's see... Is your hair bothering you? Why don't you make braids? You're very pretty with braids. Yes, but in the day. I let it down in the evening. Also with your hair pulled up, like this. What do you think? You look really good with your hair up. You look like a doll. You really are a beautiful doll. My homework? There's one that looks like you. I'll show you. Isn't she pretty? - Where are you going? - It's late. It's late and I have to go. But there's time. There's lots of time. - My homework? - No one's waiting for you. Come, dear. I'll help you with your homework. Let me go! No! - Let's go to the dolls. - I don't want to! Don't be afraid. I want to go home! Let me go! - Come on, mum, we've arrived. - When you get to my age... - Why's the door open? - I don't know. Francesca. Francesca's not here, the light's on, she was doing her homework. She must have gone to the accountant for help. At this hour? - Francesca! - My god! Usai was the perfect clerk, a shrewd accountant. And he's a typical example of compulsion to repeat. Psychological analysis revealed a hidden trauma in his early childhood. He was eight years old. As a child, Usai adored dolls. The doll! My doll! Give it back! - What's wrong with you? - Leave him alone, he's just a kid. He was jealous of girls who had them. He even hated them. Not only were his parents worried about this tendency... but they felt lessened, offended in their pride. They'd wanted a boy so much. Come on, let's go. What is this unnatural fascination of yours with dolls? - Why won't you let him be? - You'd better change your ways! Keep out of this! Tell me where you put that doll? Where have you hidden it? - Where have you put it? - I didn't take it. - What's this then? - That's enough! Don't contradict me! Not only is he an embarrassment... He's put my job in jeopardy! I'm a laughing stock! Stop meddling! It's time for you to grow up! That cruel repression was an enormous mistake by his parents... and it remained in his soul. Certain childhood traumas are just like germs in an illness. And when they become adults, sometimes they turn into obsessions... and other times they explode in the form of an irrepressible madness. That's why someone like Usai... Who, on the surface, appears perfectly normal... Becomes unable to have sexual relationships. Unfortunately, that's a regular sight around here. Open it. If you'd care to follow me. Good morning. Sit down, sit down. As I said before, the criminally insane aren't all victims of childhood trauma. Sometimes it's simply hereditary factors, alcoholism, syphilis. And others. But whatever the pathogenesis... That is, the origin of the evil within. The disease causes the subject to project certain instincts onto others. Which we call psychic components. This process of imbalance is often caused by a trauma... which has left its indelible, pathological, mark. Aggressiveness, for example. It's a normal component of a sexual relationship. Just think of the relationships among animals. Or the initiation ceremonies of certain primitive tribes. But, while under normal conditions, aggressiveness is subservient to love. As a kick to overcome certain inhibitions. Like shyness or feelings of inferiority. In pathological conditions aggressiveness itself can take charge. That is, to disassociate itself from the eros instinct... and serve itself, precisely as a kind of replacement of eros. From this imbalance, sadism. From eros, its natural meaning disappears, which is love. And, in a reversal of values, hate enters and takes over. Sadism is almost always an act of vengance. Against the defeats, the frustrations and the continuous humiliations. Especially during childhood. They reawaken this instinct for aggression. A sadist is usually timid, reserved, inhibited. Who tries to project themselves onto others through fear. I?ll show you where the experiences of an inhibited subject can lead. Who, through the phenomenon of transference... sees his very own fears in his victims. He'll appear completely normal to you. But he's here because he killed a woman in a terrible way. Burnt alive. Here he is. How's it going, Gilberto? How are your rabbits? Not bad, I was cleaning the cages. Good morning. Our Gilberto's an expert. Animals, plants... He's an expert. - You studied agriculture, right? - Actually, I never finished high school. Agriculture is one of many interests, but I prefer gardening. Flowers. There's our Gilberto looking after his flowers. I don't know what we'd plant in our garden if he wasn't here. - And the vegetable patch. - Right, the vegetable patch! Gilberto. - Are you okay? - Yes, thanks. Gilberto is a unique case. Exemplary, I'd say. Of sadism as revenge, as a way of conquering his fears and inhibitions. It's a typical case of transference and compulsion to repeat. So, his story... Orphaned at birth. His early childhood is spent in a small orphanage. And it's there he first begins to feel different to the others. He experiences loneliness, the first humiliations. Check this one out. - What do you want? Go away! - I want to play. I said go away! And stop bothering us. What's going on here? You're going to stop this once and for all, is that clear? I'm not going to keep repeating myself! Gilberto proved to be particulary sensitive, vulnerable... to a hard, severe, education. And later, in his psychological analysis... He'd always remember with particular bitterness... the humiliations and punishments he had been subjected to. What's this? You know these are forbidden! How many times do I have to tell you? I'll straighten you out! On your knees! Face the wall! You'll stay here until you've learnt to obey. And now let us talk about sin. Or better, let us talk about sinners. About those who will go to purgatory and those who will go to Hell! But the fire in purgatory is nothing but a caress... compared to the frightening fire in Hell. In addition, the fire in purgatory has a conclusion. The fire in Hell is neverending! Yes, little children, he who has sinned will go to Hell. And they will be burnt by the eternal fire! Forever! The flesh of the sinner... Especially the flesh of he who has sinned against purity! They will suffer the torment of the inextinguishable flame! Imagine a fire that devours you whole! That crushes you like the pincers of a relentless flame! Forever! Have you ever tried burning your hand with a match? Just a tiny burn. How painful! The cells themselves, the nervous system... They seem to retreat when faced with unbearable evil! This was followed by an episode which well and truly cemented his mania. Fire and sins of the flesh. Flame and sex. It later transpired he assisted in the burning down of a brothel. He was almost fourteen when he was hired by a farming community. And it was then that Gilberto suddenly discovered sexual intercourse. In circumstances that seemed to be marked by a twisted fate. - Sorry, I'm taking cover from the rain. - Don't stand there, come in. Come, dry yourself. Over here, in front of the fire. Thanks. - So many potatoes? - They're all coming back this evening. - Who? - The masters. - Isn't this your house? - I wish! It's usually full of people but there's no one here today. Come on, take this off. We'll put it here to dry. This as well. It's all wet. You're embarrassed? You're a handsome kid. Almost a man. Then Gilberto had a more complete experience. But sex always remained the sin of all sins for him. And the price was fire. That sexual conditioning never left him. Even if Gilberto's personality was well separated from his normal appearance... and from his pathological, secret side. In fact, the kid carved out quite a path for himself. He worked as an expert for a farming company. At one point he even tried to normalise his life with a marriage. But before he got married he experienced a terrible disappointment... which lead him to view women as the bearers of sin, lust and betrayal. He developed a violent, growing, hatred of women. Hate and desire, simultaneously. This is a normal aggressive instinct, in addition to eros... transformed into hate. A desire for death. What psychology calls thanatos. Gilberto only knew women of ill repute. Look, that one wants you. Good evening. Well? Where are we going? Gilberto's sex life was a secret to everyone. He'd bought an old abandoned house in order to vent... To perfect, I'd say, his vice. Obviously this was all discovered much later. When the police found his disturbing collection in that old house. That torture garden constituted Gilberto's mental habitat. A world of the occult where the ghosts of his twisted imagination dwelt. Gilberto paid prostitutes to transform those images into reality. Or some semblance of reality. Well? How long do I have to stay like this? Will you hurry up? What are you doing? What are you doing? Careful. That's hot. Not so close, it's hot. Get rid of it! It's hot! Be careful! It's hot! I was joking, fool! It was a crescendo. Gilberto, slowly began to shed all his inhibitory restraints. Come over here. Warm yourself up! Burn yourself! There, by the fire. What are you doing? You're out of your mind! I'm leaving and I'm never coming back! - I pay you! - I don't give a damn! - You're staying here! - You're hurting me! Damn you! Adami's trial resumes on Monday, we've got to move fast. I want a story on the places from his childhood. Barney, you take care of the slaughterhouse. You go to the city house. Of course they'll be different now. But we must reconstruct his entire childhood. An exhaustive report, humane, sincere, courageous. This change of opinion might upset our readers. No, not if we're informative, objective. Like we were in the reconstruction of the forest murder. It's our duty to look at the accused's childhood. It will be central to his defence. Science has its rights. It doesn't mean we're asking them to be lenient. But we obviously can't punish someone who's mentally ill. If he is mentally ill. And please... Photographs. I want lots of photographs. Young killer's childhood reconstruction Psychoanalysis guides us through a maze of conditions. It makes us aware of our social responsibility. Modern biology illuminates mysterious hereditary processes. In the very act of procreation we bring our conditions with us. A bad education can magnify the degenerative state. Childhood and puberty, these are the most dangerous areas in our journey as men. A little boy and a little girl seem the same age, the same ambiguous being. It is then that the plant of man differentiates itself. We must let nature perform its miracle. But only in a normal environment. Free, tolerant, without taboos... does sexual diversification without trauma occur. A normal environment. But how many of you can say you grew up in a normal environment? How many of us adults can say that we created... That we create a normal environment around us? The elderly look down on the youth. They judge them, they hold them back. They punish them. They don't know. We don't know how much this youth anxiety is our anxiety. How much their brains have been conditioned since birth... by the society that we have created. By the genes that we have passed on to them. Fear, violence, alcohol, drugs! Our sexual perversions. We presume a child is born with a blank slate, clean. A new story to tell the world. But it's really an old story. Stained! Already full of our illnesses and our wars! Our Buchenwalds, Our Auschwitz' Our Dachaus. Our hatred. Our physical and psychic defects. An abnormal child, a phocomelic child... The fruits of a mysterious hereditary illness... Or worse, of some medical error, have all our understanding. Our care. But a person born like this. With no inhibitions or restraints. Hell bent on the destruction of others and of himself. This doesn't move us. People of the jury, I cannot believe that you would punish someone... without first hearing the enlightened opinion of modern science. In the name of the Italian people. This court, in proceedings against Franco Adami... ...sentences Franco Adami to twelve years incarceration. And, as a safety precaution, three years in a criminal asylum. You sit here. And you sit here. - Where's Tavani? - Here he is. Where have you been? It's not the Lido but it's a jolly place. - What do you think, Maria? - It's not bad. I can't believe it! Mr. Tavani in a den of iniquity! My dear lawyer! You shouldn't be too surprised. - Did you think I was that moralistic? - I believed you. You're a real bigot in disguise! - Will you have a drink with us? - Provided it's not mineral water. As long as the first round is on me. What an honour to have such a great lawyer at our table. Let's hope he doesn't make us relive the trial. We're really glad to have you as our guest. Cheers. Haven't you had enough? Please don't let him drink too much because I have to put up with him after. Isn't she sophisticated? Sorry, that's Ren?e. She's a bit of a grouch but she's got a good heart. She's the only one who'll put up with me. She's the only one who'll put up with me also because she's got a kid to support. Excuse me. I feel sorry for him. Let's dance? Something wrong? No, just getting some fresh air. I can't breathe in there. You fought like a lion for that kid. And I'd like to say that I'm convinced as well now. It wouldn't be right if I didn't tell you. This time it was luck, the witness. You're a good man. My task, it's like life is calling me back. Like you could win a battle you've already lost. That other time was different, they were relentless. Don't drink anymore. This nullifies the years, it distances them. It confuses lives. The chaos a man carries inside. All their life. Like a mistake to deny, to destroy. Twenty. He was only twenty years old. Do you know who this is? Your son. What? You knew? I found out that evening. Yes, that evening when I called you. And you didn't say a word. You kept it to yourself. There's also a moral code. I respect it. Yes, I'm a journalist. - But first I'm a man. - Thank you. He was twenty when it happend. And for twenty years he carried those damned demons inside. That us, me and his mother... and who knows which damned ancestor gave him at birth. I've got my alcohol and my father's alcohol. The alcohol killed him. And his mother? Her vice was her wickedness. She abandoned him when he was two. But his mother was inside him, in his blood. She was consumed by her vices. She left him for her vices. A perverted sadist! That's what she gave him as a mother! Then the war, a life of poverty. Of encounters. He was already crazy when he killed that boy. But they didn't know he was crazy and they punished him. After a week in prison he hanged himself. And he wrote that he was heading for freedom. Well he's certainly at peace. Where real justice doesn't just look at the fruit on the tree. But at the roots, at the very land that gives it life. Come on, let's go back inside. Come on. Look at the fate of humanity. They mingle, they meet, they go their separate ways. That kid, what encounters will he have? What fate awaits him? Where do their feelings originate? Each one waiting for the other with their evil. Evil? God's left hand. But anywhere, even here, the right hand is always present. So they say. Let's just hope He's not left-handed.
