Man No! Thank you for joining us tonight for action news Tonight, we start with a tragic story out on 34th street. The fire that has been going on, raging for hours. We're just getting some details in moments ago. We have reports still out in the field. So here's what we know. The situation has gone from bad to worse. It appears that the initial fire started in the testing stall that was thought to be extinguished. - Moments later... - God, this is awful. Three people are still missing. Fire departments and emergency personal from numerous communities are responding. We'll continue to follow this developing story. For now, I'm Renee Smith, action news. Now, I remember. You use to be that cop. That's just over at Gleason. We'll start smelling it if the wind blows, right? Ace 32. Ace 32. Here we go. 32. We have a report of an abandon vehicle. Victim's unaccounted for. Possible injuries. About 8 miles south on 29. 10-four. 32 clear. What's going on? I heard something on the scanner about a abandon car out on 29. Sounded like somebody got hurt. That doesn't sound good. No, it doesn't Do you mind watching these idiots for a while? I must have left my phone at home. - Sure. - Thanks. I'll be right back. I'm on scene with the paramedics just north of Swamp Road, on 29. No sign of anyone yet. Copy that. No sign of the driver? No but there's some tracks around, kinda looks like a bear. Bears have five toes. Should be able to tell. Stand by. These footprints have four. Dogs and wolves have four, not bears. If it's a dog, it's a damn big one. Is that the biggest one you've got? I'm afraid so! Please place the paddles on the patient's upper chest and hold firmly. Damn, man! Are you alright? Please place the paddles on the patient's upper chest and hold firmly. Oh my God. Hey, Meg. What are you doing out here? You know what that is? You just shot Dog-man. No, no, no. Don't touch those finger nails. Why? Bacteria. You know, no one has ever seen this thing up close before. Look at the size of it. What's wrong, Meg? I thought you'd be glad that he shot it. Yeah. Maybe. It chased us in the woods. Who's us? Your deputy. My partner, Frank. Son of a bitch got both of them. It threw a rock, hard and knocked him down. No, no, no, no. Dogs cannot throw. This obviously isn't you're regular dog. 32 from 41. 32 from 41. - He's not gonna answer. - Come on! Alright, so where did this happen? - Who's car is that? - I have no idea, but that's where it all started. By the looks of it, something bad happened. Dispatch, 41. 41. Go ahead. Do you have a 20 on 32? Not yet, we think he's still out in the woods somewhere. We think he may have been attacked by a, by a large dog. It went after the paramedic too, in the ambulance. I had to shoot it dead. Okay 41, I'll try to find you some back up. No, Dispatch. The other paramedic is out there, too. We're going after both of them, now. 41, we've had other reports. Great. We gotta go in. Dispatch from 41. Can you send somebody out to pick up this thing? Oh crap. Stand by on that. This really isn't a two-man operation. Oh, Hank. It's a nice thing to do together. It's bread. Hmm. Come on, it's fun. I assume you remember how to use this? Hasn't been that long. You stay here with him. We'll be right back. Come on! It's just, it's just there's a lot of other things I should be doing. Come on. Couples shop together all the time. Huh! Yeah, maybe so. Hey, hey! Rabbit! Finally getting some good stuff, here. No, I am not cooking that poor thing. Oh, come on. It's rabbit, it's delicious. Hossenfeffer. Mm-hmm. Just the same. Get the chicken. I gotta get back to town. No he said to stay right here. I know, but I gotta get back to town. Here, take this Uhuh. No way. Take it! Get in the car. Dispatch. Come in, Dispatch. Identify yourself. This is Meg Samels. Johnny? Well, our old pal, Deputy Samels. What are you doing on the radio? I'm out here on Highway 29 and I just met up with 41. He and the dog catcher are in the woods. You've got to get more people out here. Everyone's up at the fire. I've got a tow truck coming. Come on, Johnny. Seriously? Just sit tight. The Cape Hole building fire rages on. According to the Gleason fire chief, it is still burning out of control. The chemicals used in the manufacturing process are highly flammable, and the heat is very intense. Three workers remain unaccounted for. At last count, nine neighboring fire stations are on the scene. Stay tune to your station with the hits, for breaking news. Wow. That sounds pretty bad. Hmm. Those poor people. I hope they're okay. How much longer is she gonna be here? I don't know. Who cares? As long as it takes. You know she's been through a lot. Well, I sure wish she'd do it some place else. I guess it was pretty windy, last night. Here. What are you doing? Poor little fellas. Oh God, be careful. There you go. That's very sweet of you, honey. Well, those guys wouldn't have had a chance if... Oh great. You son of a bitch! I thought we had an understanding! Take it easy, lady. I could just... What's the matter? What happened? He's at it again! Now come on, Lorna. Whatever happened, it can't be that bad. You are a horrible person. Take a look at this face. What makes you think it gives a rat's ass? You... You Bastard! Lorna? Come on, come on, let's go inside. No. Let here go. Come on where are you going? Wow. You think that's last we'll see of her? Oh, stop it. It's been over four months. I think that's more than generous. I can't take it anymore. It's only been two. She's driving me crazy. Well, believe it or not, she was a lot of fun when we were kids. Yeah, I'll bet. Oh, come on. What? Oh. I sure wish that nut job sister of yours would mind her own business. All stations! All stations! Johnny, this is Meg. You're the only one responding. Any sign of 41? No. I'm really worried. Are you still at the scene? Yeah, with the paramedic. It's just us. We're getting calls from south of town, kinda near you. Reports of big dogs on the loose. These things are really dangerous. I'm gonna try to raise 41. Okay. But you need to get more people out here. Doing what I can. 41? 41? 32? 32! Please respond! Do you have a phone? No. What are you doing? Hey, I gotta get back to town. - You can't leave! - No, I have to get back to town, trust me. If one of those things shows up, just aim for the birdcage and pull the trigger. 41, 32 to Dispatch. Copy. Ah! What are you doing? I don't think you'll be hunting for a while. Asshole! You've crossed the line, sister! I want you outta the house! Ah! You are gonna pay! What's going on? If I hadn't seen it myself, I would not have believed it. Hang on one second. Hey, Frances? It's me, Deputy Samels. We met last year. Listen, I really have to talk to you. Meet me at the tavern as soon as you can. I gotta get out of here. What the? Holy crap. Jesus. Hello! Hello? Hello? Found that in the yard. The way I figure it, that psycho sister of yours wrecked 2740 bucks worth of my hunting gear, and she's going to pay back every last penny. Well, she's has always struggled, but with Walter passing and everything... Poor bastard. I can't say that I blame him. It was a hunting accident. Okay. Yeah, sure. Maybe it is time to call someone. Nope. No way! Not happening. Why are you touching me? Hank, let her in. - Absolutely not. - Get outta my way! What's the matter with you? What's the matter with me? Lorna! Come on in. We're just, surprised. How are you doing? You destroy my shit, and then you waltz in here, like nothing happened? What? What do mean, 'what?' Hank, let it be. No, no! Hang on a second. Are you saying you don't remember vandalizing... I stopped off at that Italian place and bought lasagne for dinner. I hope you like lasagne. I'm starved. Well, that's very nice. Hank? Plus, I got the sesame salad. I just thought you deserved something special for putting up with me. What the hell is this? That's so sweet. The dressing is awesome. Homemade cherry vinegar or something. Dig in. She's nuts. Maybe we should just enjoy this nice meal, that Lorna has brought us. Don't you think, Hank? Meg? Frances. Hey, come over here. You guys doing okay? You look great. Thanks. You do too. Thank you for meeting me. Your call came just at the right time, I was just leaving town. Let's have a seat Okay. So. You work here? Yeah. I threw in the badge. Really? Wow. You were a good cop. You took it seriously. I wasn't that great of a fit. Where've you been? I moved up north to my grandparents' farm. It's very remote. Obviously, I couldn't be around here, not with... Yeah. I've been think about that a lot, actually. It's probably grown up, by now. Yeah. Yeah, you could say that. Hey, so what's up? Earlier today, I was out with the cops out on 29 and, I don't know what's going on but, for whatever reason, the dog-man is starting to show up, again. Show up, as in sightings? No. What? It attacked a paramedic, and a deputy shot it dead. A dog man. [Meg} Yeah. Are you sure it was dead? We thought it was. We looked away for a second, and it was gone. Just disappeared. Yeah. That's not surprising. What? Sadie has been doing that lately. You named your dog man Sadie? Frances, you are crazy. She's changing. This whole time, it's been like having a big Newfoundland puppy or something. You know? She, She cuddles with me on the couch and we play fetch and she chews my sneakers... What about the fingernail bacteria thing? I keep her claws clean. Dip them in bleach a couple times a week. Frances, those scratches can kill you. A keep a batch of that moss in the freezer, just in case. Yeah, it still sounds risky. Up until a few weeks ago, she's just been this big, sweet, goofy puppy, you know? But I've caught her walking on her back legs. What? She's a good foot and a half taller than me. Oh my God. And last Thursday night, she turned around and looked at me. And it was like the Sadie I knew wasn't there anymore. That's why I'm leaving town. To release her. Release her? I always intended to set her free, one day. Frances, what are you thinking? My family has some land up in Canada. Hundreds of miles from the nearest village. She'll be safe. Where is she now? At a friends kennel, outside of town. Nobody was there. I found a cage large enough to hold her and she's really good with other animals. We have a herding dog at home and she follows him around like a shadow and a barn cat she sleeps with. 32, 41. Dispatch. Come in. You hear that? There's an empty car out on 29 and there's a lot of other shit going down. Frances, you know what kind of dog she is. 32, 41. Dispatch. Come in. How are you feeling? You've never showed me your arm. What? Your arm. The dog-man gash from last year. Can I see it? That's just bizarre. Dorothy told me all about it. No. Oh Hank, just show it to her. Hank? Fine. Bon appetit, freak. Can I touch it? What is wrong with you? Absolutely not. Fine, go ahead. Oh, that's a doozy. Must've hurt. You know, our nephew's friend got killed from that. Had almost the same injury. That's horrible. He was a good boy. Luckily I got that antidote, from that artist gal, Frances. Maybe your jumbo size worked in your favor, too. So what is this? Beef? Pork? I can't tell. Not bad. Tofu. It's all vegan. That's right. Vegetables. No little face is looking back at you, no moms, no whiskers or little fingers. Oh Hank. What a waste. Hello? Okay, okay. Hey, slow down, alright? Alright, okay. You sit tight, I'll be right there. What's going on? That was Glenn. He went over to 29, to clear some vehicles and there's, there's been a fatality. He called 911 and the dispatcher said that the cops had already arrive but there's no one there, it' just a bunch of empty cars. So he didn't know what to do. So he called you? Well, I'm his friend. I'm going. Oh no. You just call him right back and tell him to get outta there. Did you not hear? Someone just died. He also said something about Dog-man. - What? - I'm going. Oh no! No! I'm coming with you. Stay here. We'll be back. Oh yes. Luckily, she couldn't find This. Let's go. Be careful with these. I think I can handle it. That lever there, that's the safety. Push it forward, if you have to shoot. Where did you get this? Looks like new. Prize at a raffle. Couple years ago. Never fired it. I don't really like guns What would you've done? I wouldn't have taken her in the first place. So, you would've just handed her back to her mother. Yeah. Yeah, well I couldn't do that. Why? Because I had a connection with her. Frances, you know how crazy that sounds, right? I read my grandmother's journal, to find out everything I could about them. And? And a long time ago, during a particularly brutal winter, the tribe was starving. And my ancestor went out to pray. His spirit was allowed to enter the body of a wolf, in order to find game. He lead the hunters of the village out to a huge herd of elk. The entire tribe was saved but the man was never able to come back into his body. He lived the rest of his days out as a wolf. And his descendants, part wolf, part man, are my relatives. Hello? What? I'll be right there. Frances, what's going on? Sadie's loose. I gotta go. You don't think that thing is back, do you? If it is, we'll be ready, this time. Oh. What a mess. You see Glenn anywhere? No. Glenn? Glenn? What do you see? Just stay by the truck, keep your eyes peeled. Hank, I don't like this. Glenn! Glenn! Glad you made it. Damn it, Glenn. I think I shit my pants. I just took a look around out in the woods, there's nothing. What's going on? It's like a parking lot out here. I don't know I still haven't seen anyone. Except this poor guy here. Oh, I know. It's horrible. So, you think the dog-man did this? When I pulled up, I saw something. I guess it could've been a bear but... Bears don't do this kind of thing. No. No, they don't. Whose car is this? I have no idea. What a mess. Where is everybody? And why would everybody run off? I mean, there's gotta be six or seven vehicles out here. Maybe they're after something. Or something's after them. Oh no. What are you doing? What's wrong? Dorothy! She was with me. She was right here! Dorothy! - Dorothy! - Where could she be? Dorothy! Is that her hat? Oh, we gotta find her. Dorothy! We gotta get out of here, now! What's going on? What did you do? - I'm not kidding! Let's get the hell out of here! Tell us what happened. I actually saw it. I saw dog-man. It was sneaking around over there but it didn't see me so I just stayed still and watched it. And then you guys made a racket and then it spooked, it ran into the woods over there. Wait, did you follow it? Well I had to! It killed that poor man over there! God knows who else so, yes, I followed it! You shouldn't have done that. And then you honked, it turned, saw me, charged, and I fired at it! You shot the dog-man? Is it dead? Well, I didn't stick around to find out. But it fell hard. That shotgun is pretty powerful. Dorothy. Dorothy, that damn thing had to be put down. You did good! Then I saw another one. What? I saw another dog-man. We gotta get out of here. - Wait. - What? Where's my gun? I must've dropped it. - Dorothy? - Forget about it. No! That's a 1200 dollar shotgun. You can come back for it later. Okay, fine. Let's go. Oh, for crying out loud! We can't leave that poor man in the middle of the road. Hank? Hank! Oh God. 32, 41, Dispatch. Do You Read Me? 32, 41, Dispatch. Come in. Can I get you anything else? It's the dog-man again, isn't it? What did you say? It's the dog-man. People are seeing it. You've seen it when you were a cop. Hell, you've even shot at it. How do you know about that? You didn't hit though, did you? I was a little jumpy, I guess. It had just attacked Hanklin Purvis. Yeah, I know. He's a lucky son of a bitch. The antidote saved him. Yeah, it did. I suppose you heard about the puppy. What? A dog-man pup? A friend of mine kinda got one. But it's not a puppy anymore. And it's on the lose. Kinda sound like the dog-man that was causing all that trouble last June. It was a mom. There could be a whole litter out there. There's all sorts of stuff happening right now out on 29. Where all that trouble was before. You understand they gotta be stopped. I was just out there a couple of hours ago. I actually saw one. I saw a deputy shoot it dead. Well. Now we can finally see one up close. Yeah well, we looked away for a second. It was gone. Must've only looked dead. Oh, it was dead. Hey, Meg. No, nothing. Okay. I'll be right there. Bye. Any chance you can cover my shift? Yeah. Everything okay? I'll tell you later. Sounds like you're back on the force. I guess just drop him off at the hospital. Might wanna use the back door. Thanks for being there, man. Any luck? No. You shouldn't have brought your dog here. I know. You suppose she's joined up with the others? This is an update from the news desk at WCTM. According the officials, the fire at Capepo paint factory in Gleason, is now 40 percent contained. This tragic fire has sadly claimed the lives of two workers. One is still missing, believed to be in the structure when the fire started. An amazing show of support from fire departments and the emergency agencies, from as far away as Manistee. Stay tune as we follow this developing story. I don't know how this can get any worse. Well, I'll be. Look who's here. Hey! Meg, Frances! Hank! Dorothy! So good to see you again. I never forget what you two did for us. Oh God! You both are such a God send, last year. You saved my Hanklin's life. Well, I was gonna do something for you but you disappeared. Yeah, I kinda had to. I'm so glad to see you're alright. I heard about Sam. Yeah. Break me up every time I think about it. It's starting again. I know. We were just out on 29. I was out there too. You were? Earlier today. Hopefully, some help has shown up by now. There was just a paramedic there when I left. Yeah well. I got some bad news there. Look like he was trying to run away. He didn't make it. Oh my God. I was just with him. How many of those things do you think there are? I don't know, I I saw a deputy shoot one. So there are a bunch of them because Dorothy shot one, point blank a couple hours ago. And then I saw another one. That means they're at least three. Did any of them have a white mark on their forehead? Oh, I didn't notice. Me either. Why? Are you gonna tell them, or am I? Last year, right after you got attacked, I was out in the woods by myself and I saw it. The creature. It came right up to me, as close as you are now, and I thought it was gonna kill me but instead it, she, gave me a pup. What? Wait. Are you saying we're dealing with a, a dog-man litter, here? Yeah. There are five of them. And the mom. Oh. Well, that was wonderful seeing Meg and Frances. Sounds like they're doing good. They saved my ass, that's for sure. You want some bourbon? Oh no, that's... Sure, why not? Hello? Oh. Hi Meg. Oh no. That's awful. Yeah, of course I'll tell him. We should get your number. Hold on. Mm-Hmm. Mm-Hmm. Yeah. No, keep us posted, alright? Thanks for calling. Okay Meg. Bye. State police got out to highway 29. Sounded like they found everyone. The only survivor died on his way to the hospital. Oh. And she said the feds are coming in the morning and there's a posse forming tonight. That's a damn good idea. I'm in. I just need to get my... What do you think you're doing? I tried to stir fry some vegetables today but your skillet was soaked in bacon stink. Okay, you need to get out of my way. Seriously, Lorna. Move. Alright! What are you doing? That's my stuff! I am so sick of putting up with her crap, Dorothy! Here we go! Out you go, lady. Hanklin Douglass, put her down! Put me down! Stop it, Dorothy. What are doing? Get in there. Get in there! Wait, hold on! You get in that house right now! Lorna, let me in. Come on, roll down the window. Fine. She gone yet? No, she's just sitting out there in her car. Before I hit that posse, I'm gonna make a burger. You want one? Yes. There is not one piece of meat in this entire house. Hey. Pepperoni. Surprised that wack job didn't find it. - All this time, you knew. Why didn't you tell anyone. I just thought that the best thing was to keep quiet. I guess I trusted you. I don't know what I'm doing out there, you know? I can't... Ladies? Hey. I thought I saw you parked outside. Hank, thank God. Perfect timing. Well, listen... - We have to... - I... Can I help you? Name's Lloyd. Oh. Yeah, I've heard about you. I heard about the posse. They're out for dog-man blood, that's for sure. What? They're suppose to be meeting here. Hank, you have to stop them. Why are you so protective? Oh. You're the one. Yeah. Well the trouble is, hers got loose. You do know each and every last one of them's gotta get caught, right? Right? Every wonder how that whole damn dog-man thing got started in the first place? When I was a kid, my grandpa told me this story, kinda made sense. Happen in the early 1880s. The government sent crews to explore the unknown territories and draw maps. Each team had two men and two dogs. And one in particular got stuck, smack in the middle of a hunter, deer blizzard. They dug themselves into a six foot drift. Deep as they could, bunkered down. Endured it for days, maybe a week. But they had to get the hell out of there. Dying. So they packed up their gear and headed out into the storm but right off the bat, one of them had slipped down something. Broke his leg. Compound fracture. In a couple of days, he was dead. The other man hung around a day or so. He knew he had to give it another try but the dogs were in shape travel, they hadn't eaten in days. So the man cuts some meat off his dead friend and fed it to the dogs. And then they left. But, after a couple of days of traveling in the snow storm, the man started to feel himself getting delirious from starvation. So he, he killed one of the dogs, and ate it. Pretty desperate situation. Eventually, he and the other dog made it back to Chicago, he picked up a new line of work, and got married, got some kids, just normal stuff. And then he began behaving oddly. Shortly after that, he went completely crazy. People would see him at the edge of town at night, facing the woods. Making a sad, singing kinda sound. And then he disappeared. Hank. Please? I'll be right back. So. So, you guys are going through with it. If we're gonna do this, we gotta go now. You in? You know, I, I've been thinking about it and maybe we should let the authorities handle it. It's getting pretty dark outside. We've got that figured out. We're gonna have the headlights light up the road and we're just gonna be waiting there, ready as hell fire. The other guys are gonna go charging in, driving those bastards out. They'll never know what hit em. These things kill in the broad daylight. So which one of you signed up to run through these dog-men infested woods, in the pitch black of night? Go home guys. Let the cops handle it. They need to be stopped. I don't know. He may be right. You guys are pathetic. Fine. Well? They're not going out. Oh, thank God. You just bought me a couple of hours to look for Sadie. No, that's crazy. No one's going out in those woods tonight. Listen, pretty soon, the state police, helicopters, God knows what, will be out there and they're gonna get them, Frances. Those things have crossed the line, they have to be stopped. - Hank? - Did you not hear his story? I know a different story. What are you doing? I have to go. That is a terrible idea. I'm going with you Absolutely not. I have to get back out there and I have to go alone. Meg? Damn it, I can't believe this is happening. Do you at least have a cellphone? Meg has my number. I really don't like you doing this! Hey, Dorothy. What are you doing? What time is it? It's 2:45. Where's Lorna? Who? We've you been? I've been out, looking for her. Maybe she finally took the hint. That'd be nice. You know, we've gotta get right back out there and look for here. I'm getting worried. She'll be fine. Look at this. Oh crap! Whoa. What? What the hell? What is that? God, is that? I've had a picture of the dog-man this whole time and didn't even know it. It's gotta be the same one that attack me and Sam last year. I can't believe this. We gotta go right now. Come on. Let's go. Come on, Hanklin. You made her believe you can help find her. This is crazy. Hey, forget the stupid picture and let's go! Hanklin Douglass Pervis. Hey! Now! Let's go. What about the posse? Oh, it's not happening, I talked them out of it. Good. Yeah, maybe. Frances is now out in the woods. What? Yeah, she wants to see her dog or talk to the mom. She feels she's got some sorta connection. And you just went along with this? No. We tried to talk her out of it. Who's we? Me and Meg. You saw what those dogs did, right? Frances totally knows about it. Uh-huh. And then you just decided to come back here and take a nap? Oh. She wouldn't listen to us. Well, where's Meg? I don't know, she was suppose to call... Oh come on. No you didn't. Come on. Well, there's no message. Who's this phone number? I don't know. Well, call it! Oh, hey Meg. It's Hank. Call me right back. Voicemail. Well, now what do we do? There's still nothing to do. I don't get what you don't understand about this. I don't like that Frances is out there and I really don't like that Lorna is just gone. You seem to think that I have some sort of control over these women. They don't listen... Hello? Seriously? Where are you? What? Okay, okay. Sit tight. That was Meg. She spotted Frances' car, parked along 29, next to the swamp. Next to the swamp? Let's go. Oh my God, I'm so happy to see you. Where's Frances? I don't know, there's no sign of her. What the? That's Lorna's car! Who? Her sister. Oh my God, we gotta do something. Hank you know these woods better than anyone. Do you have anything we could use as a weapon? I don't know. Maybe. Let's go. Hey! Stay close. This is nuts! Let's just find Lorna and Frances and get the hell out of here. Shit! Come on. What do you think happen? I don't know. - Is it dead? - I don't know! Oh, my God. Look. I think he got him from behind. Somebody through this rock. Oh, my God. Come on! Oh, my God. Oh my God. Oh God. Hank, don't touch it. I don't know what's able to sneak up behind these things but what ever it is, it's pretty damn good. That way. Alright, let's stay together. Oh come on. Seriously? That's unbelievable. This happened last year. You kept loosing you snowmobile. A bunch of times. You really think the dogs somehow figured out how to drive this stuff? Holy crap, it's Frances! Oh, my God. Frances? Frances, honey. - Frances! - Thank God. Frances? Oh, God. Get her off the ground. Ow! Sit her over here. Frances, come here. Oh, my God. Ow. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I was, I was running up the hill and I heard all these awful sounds. And then something just came out of nowhere and knocked me over and I hit my head. And then I kinda came to and I saw her. Sadie? The mom. It was like, it was like she was watching over me. Any sign of Sadie? On our way in, we came across two of the dogs. They, they've been killed. Ashowe. Ow! Over here. You got her? Here's one of them. That's not her. It's not her. Alright. Down here. My girl. Oh, my girl. Oh, my baby. I'm so sorry. No! No! I'm so sorry. Sorry, Frances. No. We have got to find my sister, now. Your sister is out here? Here. Take her to the truck. No! Come on. No. No. We've got to stay together. We've got to find you sister. Alright, come on. Okay. Alright, alright. Lorna! Lorna get over here. That was the mom. I watched her kill one with the rock. I have a picture of her. She's the one who attacked Sam and me, last year. She was protecting her pups. And now, she's protecting us. They all had a bad seed. She knew that. Come on. Let's get the hell out of here. I don't feel that great. Could somebody drive my car home for me? Yeah, I'll do it.
