[rifles firing] [faint up-tempo piano playing] Whoa, whoa... Is that all you've got to do? I'm making a whistle for a kid. I suppose you've done nothing about my barrels of high-grade oil. I've been thinking about that right along. Everybody knows Whit Lacey did it. Why didn't you get a posse and ride out after them? I didn't know which way to ride. Excuse me. Don't get too riled up over Sam, Mr. Martin. He's getting old. He'd better show some energy, or I'm gonna write a strong letter to Washington. [piano playing] Evening, Miss Lin. Julie Ann. You ladies going out for a ride this fine evening? We're going shopping. And I have no intention of leaving town, you'll be very sorry to hear. Kind of late to go shopping, ain't it? Barnaby will be closing up. We work and sleep late, so we shop late. Can we go, Cherie? Didn't mean to hold you up. There's enough people being held-up here. Well, good evening. I was just closing up. - But come in though. - Thanks. I got some stockings, Miss Julie Ann. Real lace, embroidered. Now where'd I put...? Oh, here they are. [groans] There... I'm sorry, I'm just closing up. Just be a minute. I want a coconut. A coconut? What's them? - I saw them in the window. - Oh... See anything green? Anybody ever tell you you're a handsome heifer? A fella said it once in just that tone of voice... He died shortly after, with a little hole through his gizzard. I like women that give off sparks. So, that's a coconut. When they came up on the stage, I didn't know what they was. What are they good for? Drink? It hasn't got the right label. It's imported. Maybe you're afraid to try something new. I don't scare easy. Mm... It's wonderful. It tastes sweet. Something like... - Like nectar. - Ah, nectar? Never heard of that before either, but I have some up on the next stage. I heard a shot near the backdoor. Oh, it's nothing. Just opening up a coconut. What's your name? Answering questions is not my favorite pastime. Stand to one side, ladies. You'll answer mine. I thought I'd be lucky today. Saw a criss-cross spider web this morning, it's always good luck. Your name's John Drum. People in Texas want you so bad their mouths are watering. They want you for 1500 dollars worth of reward. I'll have that gun. [Barnaby gasping] Help me with him! He... Hey! He went out the backway! Come on. We can't do any good around here. - I think I'm going to faint. - Don't try to act like a lady. Don't be scared, ladies. We got all the buildings out back surrounded. We'll get that fella, sure. - I wonder where Eben is? - I'll call him. - Evening, ladies. - Oh, you... I couldn't get to my horse, so I'm taking this nice looking sorrel. That happens to be mine. Sorry. Can't guarantee when you'll get him back. [gasps] I really think I'm going to scream. You got a nice white neck. It'd be too bad if I had to get it black and blue. Don't yell. - See anything of him? - Nope. - Must've ridden out of town. - How's the Sheriff? Dead. Shot clean through the heart. Get my horse. It's too bad I have to get out of here. I have a hunch if somebody rubbed us together, we'd both make sparks. There he goes! Yah! [grunting] See any Sioux's, Mister? Not a sign. There's a war party up north. My Uncle Gilly's seen 'em. There's always a war party if you listen to everything everybody says. Pa just said, "Pack up. We're getting." Got any .44 cartridges you can spare, Mister? Sure. Thanks, Mister. You better come in to Deadwood with us. Your Uncle Gilly'sseeing things. Well, I hope you don't find your hair drying in a Sioux teepee. [clucks] [Indians ululating] So, huh, you fought Indians before. Kind of liked the way you were handling the deal, until that buck with the rifle got on your back. You just sat there and watched. I enjoyed the whole show. I had a good seat. Anyway, thanks for taking that guy with the gun off my back, finally. I figure I saved your life. [speaking Spanish] That Spanish is too fast for me. "He who saves a life assumes its burden." - That buys you off, huh? - That's what they say in Mexico. I'm Whit Lacey. John Drum. You're kind of wanted around these parts, aren't you? You and I ought to get along fine, Johnny. Indian Eddie just told me you shot the sheriff in Deadwood. You can't be slow. Sam was mighty sudden. Things fell my way. Never had anything against Sam. Except the badge he wore on his chest. This piece of paper says your wanted pretty badly down in Texas. So I hear. Couldn't stay in Texas long enough to find out. Hm. Anybody see you, besides the two girls and Barnaby? Just the store keeper and the two girls. Lin and Julie Ann. That's Julie Ann's horse. Yeah, I think it was. You're in luck, Johnny. They're friends of mine. They won't talk. - Barnaby? - Julie Ann can handle him, if I say so. You're too anxious to do that, so you must need me. There must be a profit in it someplace. Where do I stand on that? You speak right up for yourself, don't you, Johnny? Well, there is a profit in it and you're in for a cut of it. It'd be nice if I could see all the cards. - You're going back to town. - So long, Whit. Look out, Johnny! Over there! What's the idea? Sorry, Johnny, but I couldn't let you ride out like that. Feel like talking now? What about? About that favor I wanted. You know, I could let the posse find you here. They'd really like to hang the man that downed old Sam. You don't give me much choice. I thought you'd see it that way. Julie Ann's a friend of mine... A particular friend. The trouble is, Sheriff's Office knows that. They're waiting for me to show up in town, or for her to try and leave. They can't stop her, can they? No, but they're watching her. She's followed every place she goes. They know that sooner or later, she'll lead them to me. She makes good looking bait for their trap. Sometimes, a smart lobo can steal the bait without getting caught. Running into you gave me an idea. Where do I fit in? - You're getting married. - Me? Yes, Johnny, you. Oh, no. I always figured on passing up getting married. Well, I don't generally go around endorsing it. But any sensible man would figure that's better than having his wind cut off with a six-strand rawhide rope. Since you put it that way, who's the bride? Julie Ann. That's the part I don't like. But listen to this, Johnny... You're an old friend who turns up, always wanted to marry Julie Ann. She's tired of waiting for me and decides you wouldn't be so bad. Now once she's married, she can leave town without being followed, and bring her here to me. The idea kind of appeals to me, at that. I'd rather it was the other. Just in case you're getting any fancy ideas, Julie won't really be your wife. It'll look all right, but that's all. Suits me. How about untying me and giving me more of the details. Sure, Johnny. Of course, I trust Julie Ann. But they got another saying in Mexico... "A handsome caballerois the fire on which the beans of many a lady get burned."

He stopped a waiter, sent for Barnaby too. [up-tempo music continues playing] Whit? Where are you? - Ouch! - Well, you give off sparks too. - Not for you, Mr. Romeo. - Romeo? She's beautiful and she reads, too. - Why did you come back here? - To see Julie Ann. Say, you know you've got pointed ears? I'll thank you to mind your own business. Know what it means when a girl's got pointed ears? I've not got pointed ears. And I don't want anymore conversation about me or my ears. Just you wait till Whit Lacey hears about this. - He sent me here. - I'll bet he did. Hm. Makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. - What's it mean? - Hm? What does what mean? When a girl has pointed ears. "My lady with her dainty pointed ears My lady's like A vixen fox's morn Passion boils in her veins Her lips and arms are warm for me Her heart is feverish, burning..." Well, I like that. Who said that? A fellow named John Gay. I've not got pointed ears. I thought Whit was here. That's what I thought. Yep, Whit was right. You're gonna make a beautiful bride. - Whit said that? - Mm-hm. And he's sorry he can't be here for the wedding. What was that? We're getting married, Julie. Whit says so right here. You wanted to see me, Tom? You better go in Julie's dressing room. Oh... - You sure you like the idea? - Of course. Don't tell me if you don't want to, but... where do you think you'll be going? To California. He used to spend hours talking about it. It's a new country. People aren't so particular about other people, or what they've been. [knocking on door] Julie Ann, I don't know what you want to talk to me about that you couldn't just as well have waited until... You know, you... - Why, you're the... - Barnaby... This is, shall we say, Mr. Corrigan. He's a friend of Whit Lacey's, a very good friend. Aren't you gonna say good evening? Good evening. You didn't give any descriptions to Tap, or anybody after the shooting? Oh, no. Not a soul. That didn't even ask me. Well, we just wanted to ask you... Have you ever seen Mr. Corrigan before? Uh, what do you want me to say, Julie? Whatever you think healthiest. I've never seen the man before in my life. You're smart. Smart people don't wear out so fast. Is that all you wanted, Julie? That's all. Come on, Barnaby. - Why, where to? - You're buying me a drink. Oh, a drink? I'd be glad to buy you a drink, yes. Tears for Julie Ann? Why don't you mind your own business? Why did she have to fall in love with a man on the run? It's easy for a man to get on the run. A few cross words, a fast draw... One man's dead, the other one's on the run. - You ought to know. - I do. Can I say goodnight? Good night. You cried for Julie Ann. Is she your sister? She's my friend. Good night. I pronounce you man and wife. Kiss the bride. [CHEERING, BAND PLAYS] Oh, dearie, I'm so happy for you, I could cry. [LAUGHING] The one who catches it is the next bride. Oh! Ohh! [LOUD LAUGHTER] Charlie, get me a bottle of champagne and a deck of cards. - Yes, Mrs. Corrigan. - The name is still Julie Ann. A bottle of champagne for Miss Julie Ann. - And a deck of cards. - What? Sure. She told me to bring them up. Come on in, honey. Get the glasses, Lin, will you? Red knave first. That's good. Queen and double sixes. A journey. Well, that we know is coming true. Ace of diamonds... Money. Ah... Nobody with any sense would believe that stuff. JULIE ANN: That's clever. You're a funny person for a gunman. Maybe he wasn't always a gunman. Maybe it took him some time to figure out what he's best fitted for. Notice how her voice gets an edge to it when she talks to me? I don't think she likes me. One doesn't prove the other. Like me and Whit. At first, everything we said had an edge. And then one night he kissed me. All of a sudden, we both knew that up until then, we'd been making empty words. See? Good night, Romeo. She doesn't believe I'm sincere. Most men aren't. At least not the ones we meet around here. I hope you two will be very happy. Tap, it ain't every man that gets to see his own funeral. Don't know as I rightly like it though. It seems kind of ghostly like. There's my cousin, Pete, all red-eyed. Mostly from corn, not from grief. And there's Banker Havens, sad as can be. But probably wondering will my house pay money enough at auction to cover the mortgage. Come on, I want to buy something. But the funeral, I laid out Sam in that box... Come on. This town's gonna miss old Sam. [knocking] Go ahead... Go on down to the funeral, Tap. You won't have much trouble looking sad. Just remember it's only play acting, and you ain't really got my job yet. [chuckles] That'll do it. Well, kind of hardy for a dead man, ain't it? You know, I was surprised when I heard about this marriage business. - I didn't count on that. - Nor me. I thought they'd figure the man that got the sheriff would be a fine addition to their crowd. Whit got a smart idea. Thought if Julie Ann had a husband, it'd keep you from stepping on her heel. What he was, was a fake of course. [chuckling]I kind of thought as much. You know, there must be some towns people mixed up in this. Their information on the wagon movement is much too accurate. We'll coast awhile, find their hideout and get the whole crowd. Hm. Big plan, but good. But I don't relish the idea of playing dead all the time. It's kind of confining. But we'll try it anyway, huh? I gotta get started on my honeymoon. That's not a bad deal at that. There's lots of fellas that wouldn't shy away from a honeymoon with Julie Ann, you know. - Good morning. - Going on a hunting trip. My wife tells me you have a habit of tailing her every time she steps outside the town limits. - Well... - It's an unhealthy habit. You haven't got antlers. You wouldn't look good mounted over a fireplace. - Now wait a minute... - Hold it. Look, Sam was sheriff before he was killed. Maybe he had a reason for following Miss Julie Ann. But I'm sheriff now. I got no reason to follow her. See you. You sure let him jingle his spurs out loud. Still waters run deep. Tap was a lot meeker than I thought he would be. Tap's just talk. Don't you get tired of that. It passes the time. Look, Lin. It's of you. Are my ears pointed? [chuckles] No... You can come out from behind those tamaracks, friends. Been listening to you for 10 minutes. [gasps] Oh... You've got good eyes and ears, Johnny. I've gone clean through a Sioux war party without being seen or heard. Oh, darling, I never thought I'd see you again. You think I'd run off and leave you married to a man you hardly know? Take care of this, Lin. Julie Ann and I are gonna need it. I stayed about 2 miles behind the ladies. I don't think we were followed. I'm right sure you weren't. I've been covering you from the town limits. Nobody followed. Oh, that's Bide and Gump. - Bide's the ugliest one. - Hello, Gump. I'm Bide. He's Gump Hey, that's handsome. Do one of me and Julie Ann, will you, Johnny? - Sure. - Make yourself comfortable. I gotta meeting before we move. You're gonna go some place with these men. Yeah, that's right. A little business trip. I thought we'd have it done before now, but things got delayed. Darling, I don't want anything to happen. It won't. California's a long way. We need traveling money. [whistling] That'll be Calico. WHIT: You're late, Calico. Bringing him here... I don't like it. I don't like it a bit. Never mind what you like. What's the play down south? You... want I should talk in front of him? WHIT: Even if you don't like it one bit. Well, the trail herd is getting close, but I got a hot tip on another proposition. Eight hundred rifles and 6000 rounds of cartridges being traded in over the powder. Four man guard. This fella paid 10 dollars a rifle. - We can jump the outfit... - No go. CALICO: But it's 8000 dollars. Twice what the herd's worth. WHIT: I said no go. - I don't like... - Say that once more, and I'm gonna kick your teeth in. I'm tired of hearing about what you don't like. I don't want to sound like a soft hand, but... that fella sure was figuring on selling rifles to the Indians. They give 50 ponies for a rifle. A white knight on a white horse, huh? Have it your way. Nice shooting, Johnny. I'd hate to lose Calico, even though he does get a little proddy once in awhile. Even-Steven. Bueno, hombre. Julie, you and Lin ride back to the cabin. Wait for me there. Bide and Gump will go with you. You go too, Johnny. Uh, you'd better ride blindfolded. Well, where are we going? There's still nothing wrong with the trail herd. There's my traveling money, Calico. Must be good stock, if they're figuring on selling to the Cavalry men. We'll save them the trouble. [whistling] Hyah! [loud gunshots, indistinct shouting] - Whoa! - Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! [gunshots, shouting] Save it. They're out of range. [gunshots, indistinct shouts] - He's hurt bad. - It's 30 miles to the nearest pool. [men whooping, yelling] It takes tough horses to stand up in this part of the country. We run them pretty hard sometimes. So I've heard. Anytime you get more, the Army will pay top prices. I'll remember that. Try to get around again next year. Rather have the cash, I suppose. - It's handier. - Just sign across the bottom. Funny thing about you fellas, it isn't money unless you got it right in your... Excuse me. - Picked him up out on patrol. - Take him to the doctor. Wait a minute. What's the matter? Those are our horses. The ones they stole last night. OFFICER: Hey! Sergeant, after them! [gunshots] Doesn't look like you had much luck. I don't even want to talk about it. Supper's about ready. You'd better get washed up. Caught this buck outside the door this morning It reminds me of the Big Bend Country. Got a nice spread there, Fork River Ranch. - Fork River? - Yeah. I've seen the brand. I figure on living there someday. When all the sheriff shave died off? Never misses a chance to dig her spurs in, does she? Rising biscuits? Someday, when all the sheriffs have died off, I'm gonna find me a gal that can make rising biscuits, and take her to live on my Fork River Ranch. If lead poisoning doesn't set in before then. Or you come down with a shortening of the breath. Sis, we never mention hanging in this house. It's what the Indians call bad medicine. Let's take a walk. Unexpected invitation. You usually act like I was a coiled diamondback. I just wanted to give them a chance to be alone. Ouch. Wanna know something, Lin? We're not going to California. I didn't say that. Said you have to go back to town for a while... till I can send for you. - When will that be? - I don't know. A few days, maybe. You don't mind, do you, Johnny? Not at all. As a matter of fact, I like being married. I might have to try it sometime. Oh, been hunting, eh? - Yeah. Have that tanned for me. - Well, sure. - Got any slickers? - Oh, plenty of them. Follow me. We went in from here... I drew these the next couple of days. We can get a surveyor to draw a triangulation line. The point where they intersect will be the hideout. Mm-hm. That's rightsmart thinking. I'll get an Army surveyor over at the far outpost. Once we get the hideout mapped out, it'll be easy to find that narrow passage going in. It's real narrow? I rode it going in and out in the dark, blindfolded. And that's the way it'll be when I go in again. But it was narrow, all right. Whit have any suspicion of you? I like Whit... Feel a bit like that fellow who took the 30 pieces of silver. - A fellow I might know? - Nope. Thirty pieces of silver... That must've been something that happened before I was sheriff. Yes, I do suppose.

No, thank you. Oh, sit down a minute. Oh, but I'm tired. I have to go back. What's a minute or two out of a lifetime? Come on. All right. - Sit down, sit down. - Thank you. You sure you won't...? No, thank you very much. I need a little relaxation. My stockholders are screaming murder. You'd think these hold ups were my fault. You'd think it was my fault the vein's petering out. Well... it won't be long. - I'm going back East. - Oh, is that so? I'd like to take you with me. You know the answer. Well, I've heard it often enough. But Lin, you've got quality. I can't imagine you not wanting to get away from all this. But I do want to get away from all this. Well, then... No. Almost all relationships are compromises, Lin. And marriage is, too. Now, look at what I've got to offer. A way out of this life. Money, security... Marriages aren't made in Heaven. Maybe not. But wouldn't it be wonderful if they were? Good night. - What are you bawling about? - I'm not. You are too crying. What about? I'm all right. - If anybody tries... - Nobody has done anything to me. She's crying for a very primeval reason. I'm not crying. She's crying because she must. Because at a certain time in every females life, she begins to discern the law of percentages present an almost insurmountable obstacle to each female finding the exact male who is right for her. In short, she's discovered that the world isn't perfect. Well, I must say, if you're talking sense, you manage to hide it behind a lot of educated words. I went to school and learned to read. Don't hold it against me. I can't make any sense out of either one of you. Lin, your Mr. Martin's a very practical man. Very logical. He's not my Mr. Martin. You were listening. Let's say I couldn't help overhearing. You're not gonna marry the wealthy Mr. Martinand go live in the East, just because you don't love him? I have my own reasons. You continue to rise in my estimation. You know what I'd like more than anything? For you to come live on my Fork River Ranch? You men... with your shootings and guns and killings. Why can't you be just like... Going hunting. Give me a box of .44s. - Going hunting this morning? - Yes. Morning. - Good hunting. - Thanks. I can't understand anyone chasing into the hills after deer, when you can shoot a buck on the edge of town. Stalking them's fun, some people think. That brings me right to the point. Why don't you do something about Whit Lacey? Mr. Martin, I could tell you something that'd make your eyes pop out. - Oh? - But I gotta keep quiet. Just don't you worry none about Whit Lacey. Is it too early to buy a drink? - My watch is plumb stuck. - Well, come on then. Indian Eddie around? I got an errand for him. MAN: He's asleep outside, Mr. Martin. MR. MARTIN: Oh, yeah. Get up. Still haven't changed your mind? I like having my own way. I said I'd send for you, didn't I? But why should we have to wait? I have enough money to get us to California. And enough to keep us going for awhile after we get there. Either you want to go, Mr. Whit Lacey, or you don't. Of course, I want to. I don't see what you have to worry about. A man ought to know better than to try arguing with a woman. All right, we'll go. [horse approaching] [speaking in foreign language] Better send the women inside. You make a big jingle for a small buck. This is serious, Whit. Go inside. It says here you're an Army officer. You didn't kill that sheriff. He's alive. It came from a man who's got to know. Mind if I go inside? It'll be a minute. Go ahead. We're in no hurry. - I don't like... - Shut up. Tom, throw a saddle on Johnny's horse. We'll give him a run for it. You can use the rifle yourself. I'm gonna enjoy that. When I told you that what I wanted most was for you to live on that ranch, raise a flock of kids... I was making real medicine. There isn't time to tell you all of the things I meant to or never got around to... I wish we could've come out even. Me, I liked you Johnny. But nobody knows what number will come up next on the big wheel. You girls stay here. If I was you, I'd get my spurs red kicking that pony. Calico's quite a shot. He's gonna cut loose the second you pass those trees. - Thanks. - It ain't much of a chance, but better than the one you got coming. - So long, Whit. - Wait a minute, Johnny. The Indians always give a warrior wampum to pay his way to cross the big ferry. Dig your pony. [clucks] Adios. He'll be out in a second, Calico. [gasps] Give me another rifle. You're shaking! You couldn't hit the side of a barn. It's a long shot now. Stand easy. Well, you did it, Calico. Why didn't you see that rifle was clear? I'm getting out of here. This hideout will be full of strangers. I got packing to do. Hm. You just inherited a ranch in Texas. I guess he really wanted to see you live on his ranch. "Lin Connors, sole heir, Fork River Ranch, Cochise County, Texas." Whit... I missed him. Oh, thank you. You've been loading guns too long ever to put a cartridge in a magazine the wrong way. The top cartridge was in the magazine backwards. You ain't foolin' me. I'm gonna miss Johnny. It's gonna get lonely with no one to talk to but you. That Johnny, he rubbed me the right way. He had class. So, we've come to the fork in the road, eh? WHIT: Looks like it. I'm going out over the mountains. You'll have to go out the trail. The hills are too rough for the women. I hope they nail you going through the canyon. Adios. Calico never smelled too good, but I'm gonna miss him too. We covered many a rough mile together. Whit... I don't know what to say. Nothing to say. I always have been too soft-hearted for my own good. Hey, we'd better get down that canyon before we meet people coming up. - [sobs] - What are you crying about? I thought I acted like a real nice citizen. [Julie Ann crying, laughing] What's everybody bawling about? CALICO: Hey, Whit! You'd better leave, Whit. I'll cover the rear. Can't think of anybody I'd rather have. We're all right. There's nobody down there. Rest easy, friend. We didn't know who it was. I didn't expect to see you. A series of events. An Army surveyor found the gap in the hills. Indian Eddie left town on a fast horse, riding hard. I always figured he was Whit's messenger boy. He brought a note saying you weren't dead and I'm an Army officer. Well, now that puts burs all over my saddle blanket. Who would know that? Tap, you didn't say something real clever to somebody, did you? I ain't said nothing to nobody. You sure you didn't say something real smart? I ain't said nothing smart since when you got mad and was gonna fire me. I can't figure who wrote that note. Some riders just came over this top ridge. Get back to your post. You two take the horses down the trail. The women are gonnabe with Whit, Sam. This has gotta be done without them getting in the way of any gunfire. Young fella, you may be an Army officer, and the governor of the territory. But I'm still sheriff, and these is my deputies, and I figure to run this show with bullets. You see what I mean? SAM: Don't get sudden, Whit! We got both ends closed up. We don't want to hurt the ladies. Seeing how you want to go down, single file with your hands up. I told you I didn't like it one bit. For once you were right, Calico. Go on down, Sam! I'll get the boys to throw a blanket over you. Better get some sleep. You got a long ride tomorrow. Oh, we'll sleep, all right. We've gotta be real careful of our health now. Either of you boys like to tell me who wrote that note? I'd pay couple hundred dollars. Calico's broke. He might tell you. For 200? Sure I will. Who wrote it? CALICO: There's just one thing about that 200... What about it? Guarantee I can spend it in Mexico. [chuckles] I'm afraid I can't do that. Well, I'm afraid I can't remember who it was that wrote that note. Then we can't do business. I like that, Calico. You got character. I got troubles. And life is full of troubles. Life... That's life. Hm. Well... Sleep easy, friend. Buenas noches. So, you don't want to live on Forked River Ranch? Sometimes women know more about men than men do about women. What you said is like a door to a house. You have to open it and see what's inside. Like, for instance, what do women know? I knew you were looking at me all the time while you were saying those things to Julie Annat Barnaby's store. Back when you pretended to shoot Sam. I also know you have kissed many girls with your lips, but I am the only girl you ever kissed with your heart. I know you love me, Johnny, but I'd like to hear you say it, out loud. I always figured a man was a fool to get married. Weighs him down. He never walks as wide or as tall from the minute he's got a woman hanging on his arm. But I want to marry you. It doesn't matter if, from then on, I... walk an inch narrow and only a foot tall. I want to. Johnny, you are going to let him go. You've got to. He let you go. He gave me your life and threw his own life away. Yeah. And he threw me a dollar. I'm Army. I've got a job to do. And I'll stand at Jefferson while an officer hangs him. There's no other way. Julie Ann's young and pretty. She'll find another man. Goodbye, Johnny. Too bad we didn't work out. Whoa... Half-hour, folks. Half-hour. Well, what are you gawking at? Why ain't you got fresh horses ready? You won't need no fresh horses, Buck. Not for awhile. Them soldiers that passed is on the way up the powder. Red Cloud, Blue. Red Cloud? Why didn't you say so? How long are we likely to be held here? Well, not being Red Cloud, I don't know the answer. But if you wanna keep your hair, you'd better stay in till them soldiers chase them back up north. Let's see what the trouble is. - What's the trouble? - Red Cloud. You're crazy. Red Cloud was driven up to Canada last year. This is this year. The man answered me, didn't he? Hey, Whit Lacey's been captured. I don't believe it. Well, all you've got to do is step outside. Him and his squint-eyed gents are being locked up. I'm only a supply sergeant. I haven't got authority to take those prisoners. But the patrol will be back in a week. Thanks, Sergeant. Well, hello, Mr. Martin. Traveling? I know what you're thinking. Thought I was dead, didn't you? - Yes. Yes, I did. - Well, I ain't. And I caught Whit Lacey and his number one boy, too. Yeah, well, good work, Sheriff. I... About you, I don't understand... Well, you'll have to tell me all about this. The drinks are on me. Take number 5.I put the ladies in 6. Thank you. Give me a tall one. I could use it. I don't know what to say, now that you're standing in front of me. There is a thing I'd hoped you come to say, Johnny. You've gotta understand I can't let him go. Then there is nothing to say. What's, uh... What's the next step with Whit? Out of my territory. He's Drum's prisoner. Goes from him to Jefferson. Will they hang him there? Yep. Don't you worry, Mr. Martin, your high-grade oil will be safe from now on. [yawning] I think I'll get some sleep now. I can tell a bad hombre just by looking at him, and Mister, that Whit Lacey is bad and that squint eyed fell a that's with him. - Ohh... - [men grumbling agreement] It seems to me a waste of time and money to take him to Jefferson to hang. That's the way the government does everything. - The long way around. - [men grumbling] Plus, he might escape on the way. Yeah. Plus, we got a lot of good rope right here. [Sam snoring loudly] [angry shouting from a crowd] Johnny... Johnny. - Golly... - Who me? They are gonna lynch Whit. [angry shouting continues] You two stay here. You better go to bed. This is the government you're fooling with. [yelling stops] I'm an officer in the United States Cavalry. I order you all to disperse. - Let's lynch him too! - He don't dare shoot! MAN: Where the gent who said he wouldn't shoot? [laughs] He's got a goose egg on his nob. They'll probably smuggle those bandits out tonight and start for Jefferson. - We ought to stop it. - How? How about using brains instead of brawn? I didn't see you when the trouble was going on, and you was the one talking about lynching. Let's do some thinking. [indistinct chatter] WHIT: Hello, Johnny. Sure seemed a big thing to you whether we hang here or in Jefferson. We was wondering why. My order's say Jefferson. We're gonna slide out of her pretty soon. That mob's been getting charged up on whiskey and plying for trouble. - Sergeant? - Yes, sir? See that these men are fed. Have our horses behind the jail in an hour. Yes, sir. Uh, Johnny... If there'd been one man in that mob with nerve to dust off a federal, you'd have been a gone gosling. Mobs don't generally have that one man. [chuckles] Why would he take a long chance on getting down just to save our necks for a couple of days? He's Army. You can't figure out Army guys. They think crazy. Hm. They may be different... I wish I was in Sonora with a swell gal I know. Why? You scared of hanging? No, but it'll sure keep me from seeing that gal in Sonora. [chuckles] [indistinct chatter] Don't move or I'll cut both of you in half! [silence] [angry shouting] Open up! Open up or I'll bust her in! Fire one shot and we'll riddle the whole building! [pounding continues] [wood cracking] Sheriff, you're not gonna be in the hanging? All you gotta do is to watch it. [angry chatter] Pull the wagon away! Wait! Give him a last word! Yeah, maybe they wanna pray. Give them your last word. You got anything you wanna say? Don't breathe on me. You smell bad... How about you? Just remember, nothing lasts forever. - That don't make sense. - Nothing does. When I count to three, take her away! One... Two and... An Injun! MAN: Indians? You must think that gun's got a lot of range, friend. Must figure them bullets got wings. Let's get the wall to defend their charge! Turn to Howard Finks for ammunition! Give a fool a cart and he's still a fool. Only a louder one. Sam, make around to the stockade. Get those idiots from shooting shadows. You ever come closer to hanging, Calico? Once. San Antone. [chuckles] Well, nobody knows who's number is coming up in the big wheel. Hey, Johnny, I fight Indians real good. I was at Tolby Wellsin Big Cimmaron. We got a rifle for you. Wish you could see things differently. I can't. [distant drumming] I made the Apache Campaign with Phil Sheridan, so I know something about Indian fighting. The Sioux believe any warrior killed in the dark, stays in the dark, forever. So, they won't attack until dawn. I'm gonna have the Sergeant divide you into four groups. First group will goon guard immediately. The rest of you, grab some sleep. Sleep? With war drums in the hills? - You're crazy. - I ain't sleeping. Not with my wife and kids here. I'm in command here, so you'll do as I say. Through the night, there'll be fire arrows and drumming will continue as to keep us awake and on edge. When the drumming stops, it'll be dawn and they will attack. Sergeant, line them up and divided into four groups. All right, line up. We'll get things organized. You fellas on the other side, line up right here... [distant drumming continues] Hello, Johnny. The dance ought to be starting pretty soon. See anything? Little white dust clouds over behind the foothill. They're making medicine. - Anything to report? - I don't know, Major. You can't hear much with this tarnation drumming. It seems as if every patch of darkness is filled with red hellions. Take it easy. Darkness plays hot with a man's imagination. I could've sworn something moved just now by that outbuilding. Sergeant, what is that building? Langer's Store, Major. [guns firing] Cease firing! You're only wasting ammunition. Bring me the water, quick! Bring me that ladder! Hurry with that ladder! Put it up there! Bring the water, hurry! That building's gotta be cleared. We'll do it silently, with knives. A couple of men could do the job. Stakeout till daybreak. See what I mean, Johnny? Yeah. We'd have them in the crossfire. - Don't look at me. I'm not going out there. - I wasn't. Why, you fellas won't have a chance in a million. That's pretty good odds, the way I figured it. Of course, if we whipped them, we'd be out in the clear where we could make a run for the mountains. I never did look forward to hanging with any relish. - [chuckles] Thanks, Calico. - Don't thank me. I'm only thinking of my own skin... But three of us ain't very many. Look, here, Drum. I'm not used to manual labor, and Sam's trying to make me... Just our man. You don't wanna work, but you're brave enough. - You'll fight? - Why, certainly... See, he volunteers. Always joking, that Calico. We're taking a little posse to capture those firebugs in the outbuilding. You won't be coming back. Ah, how you women get ideas. - I'm going with you. - Sorry, baby. This time you'd only be in the way. I don't care, I... [drumming continues] - Where's Calico? - He'll be right along. It can't wait. Open the gate, Sergeant. Figure they'll make it, Sheriff? Rather have the Sioux's than those hombres. [grunts] Nice going, Whit. [thudding] CALICO: Don't go getting itchy fingers, it's only me. I brought you another volunteer. Go ahead, yell. You'll have the place swarmin' with Sioux. Martin wrote that note about you. He figured on breaking the mine and buying it cheap. He's got a streak of yellow pay dirt a mile wide, right up the middle of his back. So, you're the man we've been looking for. If we get out of this, you're included in the hanging. Get me out of here, Major. I'll... I'll pay anything. - How much? - Shut up, Calico. Money? Hmph. Yeah, you got plenty. When the old equalizer moves in from the outside, your hair won't stay on any longer than mine. These Indians have rifles. Here, look at it. "United States Cavalry." So, we just as well have made the money. They got them anyway. But it won't be a short party. They got plenty of ammunition. - TAP: Sergeant? - Yes? Somebody went outside, over the wall on a rope. I couldn't see clear, but it looked like a woman. Get back to your post. You helped her, didn't you? Let me alone. You... [gasps, loud thudding] JULIE ANN [whispers]: Whit? Come on up, sweetheart. It looks like I picked myself a real woman. Oh, darling. I couldn't stand the wondering and waiting. I had to come. Sure, kid. I understand. Calico, help me pile this stuff against the door. Our next customers might not be so friendly. No more fire arrow sin the last 10 minutes. Guess the Major's party made it. SAM: I knew they would. Things are mighty quiet. Except for that blasted drumming. They won't be when the drumming stops. You suppose the Cavalry will get back in time? [scoffs] Only in storybooks. If I get out of this, there's a rope waiting. I'm no good for you, Julie. You're going back to the stockade with Johnny. I give the orders around here. - I'll take her. - Shut up, yellow belly. I'm staying, Whit. Just a thought, sweetheart. Just a thought. You know, Sam, I've been thinking. What about? That note about Drumand that you was still alive. I never said nothing to nobody except Mr. Martin. Why, you stupid half-baked... It must've been Martin all the time. Go find him and bring him here. You don't want a good recruit, do you? If you speak real nice, I'll let you have Tap. Don't go doing the Army any favors, Sheriff. Oh, yeah. I see what you mean. [drumming stops] You're gonna make a run to the stockade with Johnny. Oh, no, Whit. No, please don't make me go. Please. Smile for me, Julie. Grit your teeth and smile, sweetheart. You gotta take her out, Johnny. Martin will go. Yes... Yes, I'll do it, Whit. He'll toss Julie to those red devils and make a run for it. You and me are the only ones that know about him, and we'd be gone. You'd love that, wouldn't you, yellow belly. He still goes. He can't go now. Someone's got to get her out, Johnny. It's gotta be you. Put your gun up, Whit. You're not gonna use it on me. Please take her, Johnny. This is better for us than a rope. I'll take her then. I'll look around outside. All clear, Johnny. Take of her. She's a good kid. So long, white knight. Johnny, I love you... [ululating] [gunshot] I couldn't find Mr. Martin nowhere, Sam. Probably dug a hole and crawled into it. We'll get him later. Major Drum coming in! Open up the gates! Oh, Johnny... Whit... Whit... I've gotta get back to Whit... [deafening explosion] [ululating] [frenzied shouting, gunshots] Take her, Tap. Get out of those wagons! Pull it into the breach! [ululating continues] [guns firing] We'll stick here as long as we can and go out the window for the pay off. That's hot enough, Calico. Let's go. - See you later. - You mean at that. Come on, you hellions! The big wheel stops on red! Open up! Volunteers, follow me! We'll try to get through to Whit and Calico. So, I approved your letter of resignation, and forwarded it to Washington. Until your discharge arrives, you're on leave. Thank you, sir. Goodbye, Major. Bye, Sergeant. Sam. - Johnny... - Hello, Lin. You wouldn't happen to be passing a place called Texas, would you? Mm-hm. Would be very happy to drop you off on the way. - Johnny... - Yeah? Fork River Ranch. Not for more than the rest of your life, sweetheart. Get up.
