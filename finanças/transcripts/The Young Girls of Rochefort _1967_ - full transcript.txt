THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHEFORT Screenplay, Dialogue, and Songs by JACQUES DEMY FRIDAY MORNING Set up here? That’s all for today, children. Good-bye, ma’am. And don’t forget your costumes tomorrow. Delphine, come look. They’re here. They’re setting up on the square. The girls won’t be ready. We’ll rehearse Sunday. - No need to. - Think so? We are a pair of twins born in the sign of Gemini Mi fa so la mi re Re mi fa so so so re do We’re two demoiselles who took to the boys long ago Mi fa so la mi re Re mi fa so so so re do Our mama brought us up on her own Working herself all her life to the bone To make sure our minds could expand She’s spent all her time behind a French-fry stand Papa was somebody that we never knew But when we undress one thing is true In the small of our backs, in the very same place There’s the same beauty spot he had on his face We are a pair of twins born in the sign of Gemini Who love catchy tunes, silly puns, and repartee We’re a pair of carefree young things Waiting for the joys that love brings - When our blood races - When our heart stops We’re ready to shout it from the rooftops We are delicate souls, two romantics In love with art, music, and antics Where’s that man? The man we long to find Mr. Right. . . A few faults we won’t mind We are a pair of twins born in the sign of Gemini With our feet on the ground we have flights of fantasy Teaching piano is making me turn pale I’ve had it up to here with the sound of bad scales I’m bored with these provincial ways It’s Paris for me where art really pays Dancing lessons are starting to get me down My chance is in Paris too, not in this town Why teach pliés and pirouettes all day When I could be in the Opéra Ballet? We are a pair of twins born in the sign of Gemini Two hearts, four eyes ready to rhapsodize Quarter to 12:00! I’m late. Delphine, pick up Booboo? - Can’t you? - I’ll go at 4:00. I can’t wear this! Sure, I can... No, I can’t. Guillaume will be waiting. - What’s he want? - To see me. Let him wait. You coming home for lunch? Yes, but not before 1:00. Where’s my compact? Here it is. We play the cello, the trumpet, and the banjo We love catchy tunes, silly puns, and repartee With our feet on the ground we have flights of fantasy We are a pair of twins born in the sign of Gemini See you later. - Where you off to? - The café. Wait for us. Fries? Two orders of fries. - Fair time? - We just arrived. - It’ll boost business. - No need for that. - We’re going for a walk. - Not now! We’re not on call. What slackers! - How you treat your ladies! - They aren’t our ladies... not really. Performers? The blond does an Indian shimmy, the redhead a Chinese shimmy. - It’s harder. - How interesting. He’s the boss. I’m his right-hand man, a mechanic. - Hello, Yvonne. - Hello, Maxence. Hello, Josette. Hello, Gramps. - Still abstract? - More than ever. He was born that way. In three days I’ll be discharged. - A Clacquesin. - We’re out. Aren’t we? - But he can order something else. A beer. - So did you find her? - Not yet, but I can wait. A beer for Maxence. - Did he find her? - Not yet. - What’d he lose? - His feminine ideal. He never found her to begin with. He painted her. He’s a painter-poet. He’s stationed here. We all seek our feminine ideal. He’s not the only one. Don’t be so sad, Maxence. Girls are a dime a dozen. I’ve searched all over for her I’ve sailed the seven seas From Venice to Java, from Manila to Angkor There was Jeanne and Victoria, Venus and Mona Lisa I haven’t found her yet I seek her even more I don’t know what she’s like and yet her image is clear I have a name for her Her voice is in my ear I’ve sketched her silhouette, the face I’m dreaming of The portrait that I’ve done is the very image of love She is as gracious as only romantic girls can be A Botticelli beauty with such eyes, such poise In profile she’s like those virgins of mythology Who haunt museum galleries and the dreams of teenage boys Her stride is so much like a childhood memory That passes before my mind’s eye lilting, dreamily Her hair pours down her brow like torrents of pure gold Round which wind, sea, and sun quarrel for a hold I could tell you of her hands, of her eyes I could go on and on until the next sunrise She is my only love, but what good is a dream? I’ve searched all over, but she’s nowhere to be seen He could tell us of her hands, of her eyes He could go on and on until the next sunrise She is his only love, but what good is a dream? He’s searched all over, but she’s nowhere to be seen Can she be far? Or is she close to me? I couldn’t say, but I know she does exist Is she a wicked girl? Or born to royalty? Her pedigree means nothing, because I am an artist And love is the sole authority N ice portrait, but no one like that here. - No, no one. - I prefer redheads. - Heavens! Have you seen Delphine? - No, ma’am. I bet she forgot to pick up Booboo. Could you go, Maxence? I’m already late for maneuvers. I have to set the tables. - I’m sorry. - Never mind. Bye, Gramps. Could you two gentlemen go? The school’s just around the corner. Sure, we don’t mind. You’re sweet. Just ask for Booboo. - Who? - Booboo. He’s my son, my youngest. I’m afraid I can never get out. I’m confined to this aquarium. Me, who was meant to live in the open air on the Pacific shore... listening to sweet music and reading poetry. Yvonne, I’m out of glue. Could you buy some glue on the way? Thanks. Hi, Delphe! You’re filthy! Look at you! And in your new pants! - Are you Booboo? - Why do you ask? We came to pick up Booboo. - Says who? - The lady in the café. - What nerve! - We’re on the up-and-up. We came with the fair. I bet you did. - You’re quite pretty. - So I’ve been told. - You’ll split your dress. - Quiet. So do we take the kid? - I wanna go with them. - Are you kidnappers? - We wouldn’t say if we were. - Smart aleck! Actually, it suits me fine, because – never mind. Behave yourself. Bye, pumpkin. - Your aunt’s swell. - She’s my sister. She’s a honey! I want some candy. We gonna stand here all day? Hello, dear rose. You’re lovely, dear soul. - By "soul" you mean my body. You’re so right, dear heart. If I weren’t so in love with you, I’d be jealous. But I love you, and that fills me with pride... and craving, since I want you. I inspire your baser feelings. And gluttony and lust. And prattle. You love to hear yourself talk. Myself and yourself. I love you. Is that why you wanted to see me? You don’t love me, but you’ll marry me. I already said no, Guillaume. - Then why do you come? - You’re so entertaining. But if you prefer, I’ll stop coming. Why, that’s me! Yes, dear rose. Since when do you pose for soldiers? Soldiers? What’s this nonsense? Who painted that? - I told you: a soldier. Calls himself a painter and poet. Get the picture? Know him? - An uncanny likeness, don’t you think? - Mere coincidence. - But it’s me all over! - No, it’s just figurative. You’re spiritual, dear soul. It’s a worthless picture, pure fantasy. He modestly calls it Feminine Ideal. He must really love me to dream me up like this. What’s he like? Dull, insignificant. I want to meet him. Sorry. He just left for Paris. But he’s not your type at all. You think you know me You like to talk a lot But really you do not not not... You don’t know how I feel If you did know, you’d reel You’ll never know I know how you think You’ll never know what tickles me pink pink pink What makes me play or why I dream night and day I’m just a doll in your gallery What did you ever see in me? You find my chatter tedious and dumb You couldn’t care less if I’m cheerful or glum Doubts are something you don’t show I’m a fool, whether I say yes or no no no You say, "I live only for money" and then you say you love me If you really loved me. . . But I tell you every day – If you really love me as you say say say When you tire of me, you say, "Excuse me, time is money! " But time for me is love, my friend It’s laughter and song until the day’s end And love each night since creation Time is love Life is celebration So. . . so stop thinking I’ll be your prize You lie when you sentimentalize, lies, lies. . . Buy other girls a drink You’ll find love for the price of a mink Then you’ll forget me - It’s simpler than you think - Any girl will give you a wink wink wink It may be a girl with velvety voice, but love for her is on an invoice Excuse me for being so blunt I won’t put feelings up front Let’s not drag it out for both our sakes Let’s make it a friendly break Farewell, Guillaume. Good-bye, dear heart. Your eyes are the same blue as in that picture. - I can’t help it. - Aren’t they? You like blue eyes, so you can tell. I’ve never seen anything like them. How odd! It can’t be abstract if it resembles his eyes. Which aren’t abstract, so that picture sees you as I do... Look, Mom. - You shouldn’t have! - It’s nothing. Thanks. - Here you go, Gramps. - How kind of you. - Will you have a drink? - Why not? We met a knockout blond. - Your sister. - I don’t have a sister. - He means Delphe. - Delphine... my daughter. - She’s a peach. - So are you. So I’ve been told. S.O.S.! Storm at sea! Be quiet, Booboo. Hello, Dutrouz. Hello, everyone. They’re friends. Subtil Dutrouz. "Subtil" like a scent, Dutrouz with a silent Z. - Bill as in "billiards." - Etienne, like everyone else. - Here, for you. - What is it? A plastic atomic submarine. - How’s it holding? - Fine. That’s good. I just saw them tramping by, armed to the teeth. They’d shoot us like rabbits. - What’ll you have? - Nothing. I’m off. I’ll be back later. - Who’s that? - A friend of Gramps’. - What’s he do? - He’s retired. - What exactly do you do? - Us? We go from place to place with motorcycles to sell Bikes and boats as well The road’s our home base - Today we’re here - Tomorrow there We live free as the air, like boys without a care On the move, having fun, avoiding shadows for the sun We prefer what is sweet, not sour A pretty girl, not a wallflower And pleasure, not despair We flit from face to face, like bees among the flowers In every port a pretty girl, in every town some tender hours We live on the heady brine, a baker’s loaf, a sip of wine The morning haze, the evening storm A child’s smile to make us warm The siesta at midday Making love in the hay The wind on our face We go from town to town The future’s an unknown A pretty girl lends a hand and life is grand - Today here - Tomorrow there Our life’s a romance, a melody composed by chance Full of new delights We prefer joy to misery Intelligence to stupidity Straight talk to hypocrisy And gentle arms to gendarmes We go from fair to fair Folks point and stare They call us carnies, but poets are what we are - Today we frown - Tomorrow laugh Life’s a double bill, a tragedy of fate A comedy of good will As friends we will grow old Knights without fear or blame We haven’t a penny to our name But our hearts are made of gold We go from place to place, across rivers and valleys They call us carnies The road is our home base - What’s wrong? - I’m sad and bored. You’re hiding something. It’s over with Guillaume. That’s good news. I never liked the guy. Know what I’m thinking? Yes, about your dream man. How’d you guess? It’s simple, darling. You have that "dream man" look on your face. I know nothing of him and yet his image is clear I have a name for him His voice is in my ear Often, when I dream, I see the face I’m thinking of The look in his eyes is the very image of love He is handsome as only romantic men can be Like divine Raphael, his talent is heavenly A philosopher in love with democracy And a poet who rhymes endlessly I could tell you of his hands, of his eyes I could go on and on until the next sunrise He is my only love, but what good is a dream? The illusion of love is only love unseen Is he near or far? Could he be in Rochefort? I’m sure to meet him I know he does exist Whatever reason says, my heart tells me more Its reign, its law is something one can’t resist And resist I never will Sweetie, guys like that don’t hang out in Rochefort. Not right now. He’s in Paris. He did my portrait. Who is it? You never mentioned him. A painter. I don’t know him. He exists, and he loves me. But I’ve never seen him. - You’re ill. - I’m serious. - To Paris, then! - And our pupils? - Our careers first. - Without money? Never mind that. For now we’re free. We leave for Paris next week. This afternoon I’ll go see Mr. Dame – What’s so funny? Nothing. That’s such a silly name. He’s very nice. And he knows Andrew Miller. - Who’s that? - I don’t know. An American composer. They went to school together. Andrew Miller is giving some recitals in Paris, and Simon Dame will tell him about me. I mean, in a letter. Then I’ll get Booboo. No need to. Mom sent two guys this morning. I went for nothing. Booboo left with them. You let Booboo go off with two strangers? The town’s crawling with soldiers, sadists, and unknown painters! You’ll never get a man, old girl. You were born 12 minutes later, so don’t "old girl" me! As for men – That’s it! - What? I’ve got the theme for my concerto! Good day, sisters. Schubert’s "Ave Maria." Here we are. - Is that all? - Yes, thank you. Good-bye, Mr. Dame. - Hello, Mr. Dame. - Hello, miss. Your music paper arrived. I’m sorry about the delay. Setting up this store has taken a lot out of me. Rochefort isn’t Paris, and I haven’t adapted yet. It looks really nice. I’ve tried to recreate a musical atmosphere. Now, where did I put it? Here it is. Ready for the fair? - The girls rehearse daily. I wrote a little piece for them, a three-part chorale in C minor. How much is it? Twelve francs. Please call me Simon. Really? My name’s so silly. I’m called Solange. The key of so and the flight of angels. The name suits you. I have a favor to ask. Go ahead. I plan to go to Paris next week. You hinted last Tuesday that you could recommend me to your friend, Andrew Miller, the composer. Andy? Certainly. I haven’t seen him since conservatory days. After school Andrew went back to the States and found fame and fortune. Life’s come between us. You’re in luck – he’s in France. I’ll write to him right away. I’m sure he can help you. You’ll become a great composer, Solange. A great composer. I hope so. I have the third movement for my concerto in F sharp minor. Would you care to hear it? - With pleasure. Admirable! What texture, originality, passion! What force! What lyricism! I like it a lot too. - When do you leave? - Monday, after the fair. Please don’t take this the wrong way... but when my fiancée left 10 years ago, I felt the same twinge in my heart. Your fiancée? It was because of her that I left Paris. I moved here last month to relive my memories. Does she live in Rochefort? No, Mexico. But we met here. It’s an unusual story for an ordinary man like me. My fiancée found my name a bad joke I think it even shocked her, and one day I awoke To find she’d left me without a word, without a sign I haven’t laid eyes on her in 10 years’ time She had told me one night so tenderly That we were soon to be no longer two but three It fills a man with pride It’s woman’s greatest claim But she couldn’t stand being called Madame Dame Yet she cared for me and I called her my muse But I had no idea – how poets will be amused! – That a name like mine could shame and irritate I didn’t understand until it was too late I was a handsome fellow and she a sweet young thing She hadn’t planned it but had already mothered twins I never met the girls, who were always out of sight They went to boarding school and never came home at night A few years later I met a mutual friend Who told me some foreigner had married her in the end And taken her away to a place in Mexico To live romantically in a seaside bungalow So here I am alone, a lover in despair I came to see this city since I’d met her here I decided not to leave and here I plan to stay Living with my memories and my heart at bay - You never saw her again? - Never. She must be living it up in Acapulco. She worshipped the sun. Here I am going on and on! I’ll write to Andy. I hope he hasn’t forgotten me. - Maybe he got a swell head. - What? He may be pretentious. No, Andy was a bright fellow. I’m sure you’ll like him. 4:00 already! I doubt she’ll come. The kid can’t walk home alone. Excuse me. Let the young lady by. - Hi, Solange. - Hi, pumpkin. Your slip’s showing. Fighting again! Look at you! You naughty boy! - Hi, Booboo. - Ah, you’re here? - What do you want? - We’ve come to pick up Booboo. These are my buddies. We’re here with the fair. - When do you leave? - Monday. Then bon voyage! Miss, your slip is showing. So I’ve been told. Your aunt’s not very nice. She’s my sister. She sure has changed. Come on, skip it. They buy me candy. I’ll get you licorice. I want to go with them! Then no licorice! I’m sorry. Don’t mention it. - Are you a musician? - Yes. Good-bye. Miss, your slip is showing. I know, but it doesn’t matter. Miss... may I see you again? I don’t know. I don’t think so. Come on. That guy’s got some nerve. Say, that’s in G minor! I’m in love, I am Lucky you! I do what I can I come to Rochefort to see a friend Simon Dame, he lives out this end But I meet a girl and I go crazy The girl’s gone but love’s fazed me It took a trip across two continents It took this one amazing chance To change my life and give it sense It took my coming back to France - Ready? - We can’t go without saying good-bye. My heart’s racing. - That’s normal. Look: First, I’ve had it. Second, they exploit us. Third, I don’t love Etienne. Fourth, Bill’s eyes aren’t blue. Fifth, adventure beckons. And sixth – Here they come. What’s with you? Can’t you see? We’re leaving. - What? - We’re leaving. - With who? - Two sailors. Don’t whine. It’s pointless. They’re dumb. We love them, but that’s not the worst. We give them a golden opportunity, and they cut out before a show. And for who? Sailors! Sailors give us a better time than all your carnies combined - Sailors aren’t the marrying kind - But as lovers they’re just fine As friend, lover, or husband, sailors are absent all the time Chance often does things right, but it got its wires crossed With the faded roses it tossed on the bed of our lonely nights Well, if our bed of roses is now just full of thorns And your heart is now sea-born, what can I say or propose? Shall I shoot you and mourn? Or die broken and morose? You had what it takes to please: your nose, mouth, brow, and hair If only your eyes were blue I could have died for you If my eyes, dear marquise, are not worth dying for And a sailor boy can offer more, what can I say to please? Should I go down on my knees? Should I die of jealousy? You mustn’t hold a grudge or I’ll get all teary-eyed My makeup is going to smudge I’m already bleary-eyed My makeup is going to smudge I’m already bleary-eyed Fly away, turtledoves Get along to your tropics Since our eyes are not topics to make you melt with love Go on then, my lovelies Good sailing and good loving You thought it over? We flit from face to face like bees among the flowers Today we’re here, tomorrow there For us life’s a cinch Braque, Picasso, Klee, Miró, Matisse – that’s life! Sure, life! But how do you manage? Don’t tell me you paint in the barracks. No one paints in barracks. I have a room in town. It’s my studio. Every night I go AWOL, and I go home and paint. Next week I go to Paris, and in six months, a show. - If you’re released. - That’s not funny. There’s trouble everywhere, like in ’39. That’s how it started in ’39. I saw you this morning doing your clown act. We were on maneuvers. Think I enjoy it? Cut it out! Next week I’m a civilian. Freedom! Monday. Right, Yvonne? It’s sad to see everyone leave. Why everyone? No special reason. Reminds me of my past. It’s none of your business, of course. You’ll break that chair. A past love, I suppose? What else? It was... a secret passion. I never told anyone. No one ever found out. Not even my daughters. The daughters you’re always going on about! I’d like to meet them. - Hush up! And this passion went sour, if I get your meaning. My fiancé had a name that was grating to the ear An irritating name that was more than I could bear So I went and left him without a word, without a sign It’s been 10 years now since his path diverged from mine I had told him one night so tenderly That we were soon to be no longer two but three It’s a woman’s greatest claim It fills a man with pride Booboo, the poor dear, would soon be by my side He was a handsome fellow and I a sweet young thing Even though I had twins before I met him He never met the girls I kept them out of sight They went to boarding school and never came home at night A few years later, through a mutual friend I let him know that some tycoon from Mexico Had offered me his hand and a beachside bungalow It was bitter lie, pathetic duplicity So here I am alone, and my youth is long gone I came to see this town where the only love I’d known Had seen the day I settled here permanently Living amid memories, my life’s debris You don’t know what became of him? No. He’s probably in Paris. You should try and find him. What was this monster’s name? Dame. Simon Dame. I’d have become Madame Dame. Absurd! He was a bastard! Not at all, Papa. Calm down. A bastard! Maybe so, but he had a charming name. "Madame Dame." It’s amusing. - So I did wrong? - I didn’t say that. - Shall we? - It’s figurative? I told you: It’s my only figurative work. The abstracts are at camp. You coming with us? To see my feminine ideal. - Where? On show at Guillaume Lancien’s gallery. Around the corner. Sorry, I really can’t. - You snub my work. - No, I don’t. So long. Coming? - You’ve been crying. - Not at all. Don’t lie. I can tell. - I like your hat. - So do I. Is that all that’s new? I’m flustered: I just met my dream man. Otherwise, we’re working. I haven’t seen Delphine in three days. We’re hard at work. Next week we’re off to Paris. I’ll work with the philharmonic, and Delphine the Opéra. We’re not going to rot here. - Well, you’re big girls now. Dutrouz’s right: There’s trouble everywhere. Why this urge to fight all the time? I forgot my beret. So long, Maxence. Who’s that? Maxence. A painter doing his military service. Get down! I told you not to walk on the tables! Leaving already? I’m going home. Bye, Mom. Come for dinner tomorrow. Dutrouz will be there. - Who’s Dutrouz? - You don’t know him? A friend of Gramps’ from back in ’24. They met last week for the first time in 40 years. - See you tomorrow. - Till then. You again? Your sister’s charming. - That’s my daughter. - Her too? I had twins by a first lover, but they’re not identical. Then I had Booboo, much later. Another lover. Be polite. I’m not in the mood. We aren’t either. We’ve got trouble. - Is that so? - The girls left us. - The girls? - The ones you saw this morning. They do a number for us – not bad, in fact – to draw customers. The Asian shimmy. That’s right. So now we’re up the creek. You won’t find anyone here to do an Asian shimmy. That... or something else. Your daughters could help us. Don’t count on it. They can dance, no? Delphine dances. Solange sol-fa’s. She writes music. She can dance too. But they won’t do it. - You don’t think so? I’m sure of it. With their talent, they’re not going to rot here. Next week they’re off to Paris. What’ll it be? - White wine? Two glasses. It wouldn’t hurt to ask. - It’s worth a try. - Nothing ventured... Oh, my God! One of Booboo’s pranks. That’s her. Your ideal? I once knew a young lady who looked a bit like that. A dancer. This was 40 years ago. But she was a brunette, with short hair. - Then not at all alike. - Not really. A slight resemblance here. But I don’t know anyone like that. You won’t find that sort in Rochefort. I’ve searched for her I’ve traveled countless miles From Bali to Lima, across the South Sea isles From deep river beds to beds where young girls smile I keep running after her, hoping all the while Just knowing she’s alive makes her my beacon fire Knowing she’s out there fills me with more desire Than all the naked girls in my wildest fantasies I’ve looked everywhere I’ve sailed the seven seas Can she be far? Is she close to me? I couldn’t say, but I know that she exists Is she a wicked girl or born to royalty? A movie celebrity Or a simple florist? I know she’ll belong to me That’s all, children. I met my dream man! Where? In the street. Tell me. I picked up Booboo at school He was whining and being a fool He threw a tantrum in the street He slammed his bag down at his feet There I am, with bikes wheeling round Picking up notebooks from the ground When I hear a masculine sigh I look up to see this beautiful guy He pours words in my ear like honey Humming like a swarm of playful bees I look at him His eyes take me in My heart goes into a spin He’s dark, with an intelligent air, streaks of grey in his hair Like a shepherd or troubadour It was like a concerto overture His languid gaze says more than I can tell We’re both caught in the same spell Booboo’s waiting Traffic’s rolling still But time has stopped for our idyll But we really have to part My handsome stranger gives a start He says, his emotion growing, "Excuse me, but your slip is showing" And that was all Is he near or far? Can he be in Rochefort? I’ll find him because I know that he exists I know what reason says, but my heart can tell me more Its reign, its law is something no one can resist And resist I never will Surely a foreigner or a tourist. - Why? Did he have an accent? - I don’t remember. A camera? So why an American? I said a foreigner, not an American. Not all foreigners are American. But they’re often tourists. Good Lord! What if it’s him? It’s Jules and Jim! You two again! You know them? Yes, we’ve met. Don’t stand there in the doorway. I’m cold. What do you want? - Well, your mother, Yvonne – - Yeah, right! - Let them talk. - Yes, let us talk. Your mother, Yvonne, said you were going to Paris. That’s right. - And you needed someone to take you. - We never said that. Anyway, we can take you. - In the truck? - There are bunks. I can see it now. - We’re serious. - What a come-on! Well... is that all? - We want to make a deal. - But not in the doorway. Take these. Well? - Tell them. After all, it’s your idea. - But you’re the boss. We’re in no hurry. Well... to liven up our stand at the fair, we thought – Well, it was Bill’s idea. We thought that maybe you could do a number – something lively. A number? - They think we’re strippers. - Obviously. The fact is, the artists we hired left us high and dry at the last minute, and we need – - Stand-ins. - Just like that. That’s right. So... are you interested? Interested isn’t the word. But we’ll think it over. We’re quite busy at the moment. Does that mean yes or no? - What do you think? - But what do they want? - Something lively. - You said that already. Something in this vein? In Hamburg, port of call, on a rain-slicked street Three sailors and love meet and go to the losers’ ball It’s a foursome on the town when three girls on the make Meet losers on a round on the street of heartbreak In Hamburg, port of call, three sailors from the East Talk of romance’s thrall as if they believed it all As if for that price The girls of the waterfront would give these sailor boys All the love they want How was that? - Depressing. - And old as the hills. We’ve had it with sailors, girls, and boats. We get the message. - Our song? - They’ll like that. We are a pair of twins born in the sign of Gemini With our feet on the ground We have flights of fantasy Give us a happy start Give us harmony Give it heart and a touch of sorcery Let it burst with joy Let it glow with energy Give us a song Give us fantasy Want us to dance too? Modern or classic? Something to prance to or more romantic? Would you like Mozart? Would you like Stravinsky? Johann Sebastian Bach? Or maybe Boguslawski? Louis Armstrong? Ellington? Count Basie or Hampton? Or maybe you’d prefer Michel Legrand? - Sing of love - Or even hate Just make it bright - Sing today - Dance tonight Sing of light Dance for joy Sing of wind Sing of sun and of rain - Fire us - Inspire us Enchant and astonish us Hang out the streamers of sun Paint it all the color of delight Drape every facade in light Build bonfires of pleasures and fun Why waste time? Why push me away? You’ll be my wife. . . Why a seaside bungalow? Why a millionaire from Mexico? You can’t whine till your dying day The harmony’s sublime What a paradigm Where are the pretty hands that wrote these notes? Must I never see her again? Why love on some Pacific shore When it’s right here in my store? And at the same time A true stroke of chance Find my great romance The very day I leave - Passion - Spirit - Love - Folly - Genius - Joy Life and happiness SATU RDAY MORN I NG You’re alone? Josette took Booboo to school. Gramps is still asleep. Going somewhere? - I have two days of leave left. I’m going home to Nantes. My leave’s immi-Nantes! Aren’t you funny! Give me a beer. I’ll be back Monday morning in time to pack my bags. Then it’s so long, Rochefort. Someone butchered a dame by the château in Etiquette Lane A wicker basket found today contained the pieces of Pélagie Rosier Ex-Folies Bergère chorine and one-time beauty queen Aged 60, she won hurrahs under her stage name Lola-Lola She nailed audiences to their seat before bringing them to their feet The basket’s open, the case is too Police won’t say if there’s a clue No stone will be left unturned until the slasher’s name is learned Ever heard of Lola-Lola? I’ve never known any dancers. Here comes Josette. What kept you? There was a police cordon near school where I left your son A sadist’s on the loose Some think he’s a mystical recluse Everyone’s in an uproar It seems he used an ax or a saw He cut her into bits and laid her out like a puzzle kit It was all impeccable, the feet below Horrors! No! They say they’ll get the man We must remain as calm as we can - I’ll have a look, then catch my train - He’s on immi-Nantes leave! - Until Monday - Your gear - Good-bye, friends - Bon voyage - A rotten crime, a filthy skunk! - Yet he put away the pieces in a trunk - Be so good as to move along - Please don’t get us wrong Don’t make us club you on the ear The blood came out to here It was a sweet old white-haired sister - It boggles the mind - Blonds are my kind Well, thanks a lot, mister Don’t get angry I prefer blonds But it’s not because your hair’s red That I’d take an ax to your head - Would the sadist be you? - Heavens, no. And you? - Teach music is what I like to do - Abstract art is my conceit But my ambition’s more concrete: I’m looking for the ideal woman I did a painting of her though Come see it at my studio - We can maybe do a séance - Good old Maxence ! - How d’you know my name? - Mom mentioned it when you came Yesterday to the café I’m Solange Garnier - Ah, you’re the twin, right? - You might be more polite - Where’re you headed? - Train to catch I’m off to Nantes My leave’s immi-Nantes That didn’t make you laugh one bit - That’s bargain-basement wit Don’t take it out on me So long Another time, maybe Excuse me, sir I’m looking for a certain piano store - I never buy any - But that’s plain silly! Painting’s more in my chords I play on canvas, not keyboards Well, music is my line But I think painting, too, is fine I’ll tell you what I think You and I are in the pink I’ve really got to run I’ve got a train at 1:00 My leave is immi-Nantes Immi-Nantes leave! That’s one I can’t believe! - Sorry, miss - Excuse me, sir I’m so remiss Let me help Are you hurt? No, but if you’re in a rush, no need to make a fuss I don’t mean to be a pain But I’ve been searching in vain for a guy named Dame Who has a piano store What a silly name! - Nice man, though - I don’t say no - But it’s funny all the same - That’s not why I came A name tells you nothing It’s like a face I may look dumb, but I’m no basket case It’s not that I’m so giddy I’ve been on a shopping spree But I’m a nice girl at heart Oh, yes, you’re looking for your friend’s music store Turn left here Then take the second right Thanks for the precious tip Sorry, I have to run I have an appointment at 1:00 - Hi, pumpkin! What’s that there? - Nothing, just a tear - Why all the boxes? - Our costumes, fit for a queen - Quick! Let me see! - So simple, they suit us to a T - Nifty! - Naughty! - I’m hungry! - We’re going, just wait a minute more - Won’t we look a bit like whores? Funny, the idea never occurred to me Hello, M r. Dame. Y es...? Don’t you recognize me? I’m afraid, sir... Andy! I’ll be damned! I’m unforgivable. Why, I often think of you. I even wrote to your Paris agent yesterday. - Have I changed that much? - Not at all. But I never expected to see you in my shop after all these years. Ten years. - Yep, ten years. It’s nice here. Peaceful. You live alone? What about Yvonne? She never came back. But why this honor? I’m on a concert tour of Europe. I was in Paris yesterday and thought of you. My agent told me you were here, so here I am. I’m so glad to see you. I really admire your work. What success! Truly fabulous. Even during conservatory days your talent was obvious. You knew what you wanted, and you got it. That’s true. When I was a boy, I dreamed of conquering the world In my thoughts, notes and scales swirled For me, a piano chord had infinite charm For a fortissimo I’d have given my right arm For a symphony I’d have sold my brother For a melody I’d have betrayed my mother Music was my whole life, you see And no person could get through to me Today I have everything I yearned for Fame, talent, money, and more I’m flattered, worshipped, dehumanized Stupidity has left me demoralized I’d have liked to fight for true treasures I’d sacrifice it all for tender pleasures I didn’t have love, but love is here today Every since that girl came my way Can she be far? Is she near to me? I never saw her again but I know now she exists Is she chaste? Or does she live fast and free? Her virtue means nothing because I am an artist And love is the sole authority So you’re disappointed and in love? Not disappointed, but wise and in love. For all that, will you stay in Rochefort? I can’t. I play in Paris tomorrow. But I’ll be back next week. I must find that girl. Maybe you know her? There are lots of pretty girls here. So you wrote to me? Yes, about a young friend... an admirer who’d like to meet you. She writes music. I’ll say no more. But you can help her. She deserves it. - Are you in love? - Maybe. - Pretty? - Much more. Wow! I’m so thrilled to see you. Listen to this. Tell me what you think. I’ve heard that somewhere. Nice, isn’t it? Very. I’ve heard it somewhere before. But where? - That’s odd! Where’s my concerto? - You had it today, indeed a while ago. But I put it in the usual place, between my lipstick and eyeglass case. Here comes Subtil Dutrouz. You’ve all met. Have a seat, do. - I don’t believe I know these girls. - I spoke of them. They’re my twin pearls. I believe we’ve met someplace. No, I never forget a face. Upon my word, I’ve seen you somewhere unless there’s a double of you out there. - Delphine is a dancer. - Doubtless, I’m wrong. Solange is well versed in music and song. You’re just in time. But before you partake, do us the honors and cut the cake. I wouldn’t know how. Are you being modest? I shan’t decline if you insist. Please do, Dutrouz. - Maxence isn’t here, alas. - He went home on a weekend pass. He called his leave "immi-Nantes." I had a good laugh. - The pun’s inelegant. - Who’s this joker? A painter-poet. A sailor who can do a portrait. Does he love me? It’s anyone’s guess. I drink to your love and success. To old times, so exotic! Salonica! We met there, in aeronautics. We met in Cherbourg, in front of a bar. He’d been thrown out, drunk as a tar. At the time, life was no joke. I’d lost my job and was flat broke. I got drunk. - What a downer! - Don’t be a snot! - Don’t scratch. - So what? Hands on the table! Enough champagne! He’s unbearable! - I’m sure we’ve met somewhere before. - We haven’t. Don’t insist anymore. - Let the gentleman finish his story. - Things weren’t hunky-dory. I roamed through Cherbourg aimlessly after spending six months at sea. I knew a hairdresser in Cherbourg, Aimé. He married a certain Mme Desnoyers. A widow from Tours, or was it Orleans? She was a mother, a one-time chorine. I don’t know her. No, it was Nantes, it seems. - Is there any ice cream? - Be quiet. The dinner’s a bit dull. How about a spectacle? Do a number from your show. - Without a piano, no. - I’m feeling a bit out of tune. - I haven’t seen your stage costume. - Tomorrow. But I won’t be at the fair. I’m open on Sundays. I’m stuck here. Leaving, then? Alas, all good things come to an end. - We’re off as well. We start at dawn. - Don’t get up. We’re going, we’re gone. - Booboo’s sleeping the sleep of the just. - With the bottle he drank, he must! The sandman’s gone a bit insane. He sprinkled Booboo with champagne. Good night, dears. How do I get this one up the stairs? SUNDAY Ride, ride, ride! Ride on air. No stress, no cares. For all tastes. At all prices. - I messed up my eyes! - They’re fine. Have you seen my glove? You’re on. I can’t go on with one glove. Here it is! Hurry up. And now, it’s our pleasure to present the Garnier sisters! Here they are, the famous Garnier sisters! When the summer is gone, when the seasons move on When the leaves die and fall, we only sigh about it all But to bring back a summer’s day when the cold is here to stay And your heart’s in a pall, all you have to do is love Love your life, love the flowers Love to laugh, love to cry Love the day, love the night Love the sunshine and showers Love the cold, love the wind Love the cities and the fields Love the sea, love the flames Love the world and be happy again When love has gone and died and there’s a chill in your heart You swear never again to start, and all you do is cry But if love’s to return and your heart is to burn Though everything’s taciturn, you’ve got to love When you’ve found new delight, when you feel your heart’s might And love is back in sight, each day is a summer’s day So with new joys in store and summer at your door And love as your servitor, you’ve got to sing Sing of love, sing of flowers Sing of laughter and tears Sing of day, sing of night Sing of rain and sunlight - Talk about stage fright! - It went all right. It came undone here. - A guy to see you. - Me? - No, Delphine. - Who is it? He didn’t say. Well, we got applause. Not quite the Asian shimmy, but it’s got charm. Enough out of you. Go find your shimmiers, you boors! Oh, it’s you. Disappointed? Yes. I saw your act. I came to say you’ve made progress. And apart from the flattery? If you wanted, I could make you a star. Come with me. I’m going to Paris. A lovely girl like you – - Needs a man like you. I love how you think on your feet. I never want to see you again. You’ll regret it. What about my painter? Transferred to Germany. Thanks to me, dear heart. Delphine... my sister. - It was wonderful. - Thank you. Really, I mean it. You’re leaving tomorrow? - Yes. These gentlemen will take us to Paris. I saw my friend Andy. He came here to see me. He’s going back to Paris. He’s fallen in love with a girl he saw here. It’s a long story. I told him about you. You can go see him in Paris. Thank you. That was kind of you. It’s only natural. Good-bye, gentlemen. Bye, girls. - Bye, Mr. Dame. Good luck. - Don’t stay there. - We in the way? We’d like to change. Turn around. - We have something to say. - Make it quick. Can we draw these? We’re waiting. Here goes: Etienne and I love you. And we love you too. Don’t we? Sure we do. Can one of you pass me my jeans? - We mean romantically. - What? - We’re in love with you. - What are they talking about? So we want to sleep with you. What? It’s normal when you’re in love. - That explains the ride? - We’ll take the train. You’re not very accommodating. We know your type. Always the same old tune, always the same soft sell Always the man who will take you to a hotel... Why? Never "I love you" Never "I’ll be true" Never a billet doux as gentlemen used to do Always the same refrain, always the quick fling Always a love in vain never leading to anything Why? Oh why? Never fine sentiments Never a romantic urge Never a moment intense or a lyrical surge Always guys on the run, always the one-night stand Always up before the sun and off with a wave of the hand Always the passion that cools, always the bad aftertaste Always the feeling of haste, the heart playing the fool Oh why? Why do you sigh for us? Why do you take us to bed? Why say you’d die for us but never promise to wed? - Why get so upset? - Why lecture us like this? But to end the fête can we give you a kiss? Okay? Okay - Still coming tomorrow? - If you promise to behave. - We’ll try. - Then we’re coming. - Meet us here at noon. - See you tomorrow. - Always the same refrain - Always the letdown - Always telling us no - Never is the answer yes... oh, why? Always those promises But tomorrow never comes We never have a chance We really look dumb Why? MONDAY MORNI NG Postman! Hurry. You’ll be late. Hurry, Booboo. - Bye, sweetie. - Bye, Mom. - A cup of coffee. - Make it two. - Leaving already? - We’ll be back. - Taking my girls? - We meet at noon. Be careful. Was the fair a success? - A huge one. - And my girls? - A triumph! They made the front page! With a photo! "Twins launch their own Gemini." What’s that mean? - I don’t get it. - Me neither. Look, it’s Dutrouz! "Sadist Hid Murder Weapon at Home." That’s Dutrouz, all right. They forgot the Z. He’ll lose his head. If he holds on to it. How about that! - Shall we? - Let’s go. We have to go by the hotel, then finish loading. And that fuss about cutting the cake! Wicked man! Good-bye, and bon voyage. If you’re ever in Rochefort, stop by. True, there’s trouble everywhere. Dutrouz... the rat! 11:30 already! - I’ve come for my lesson. - School’s closed for good. - Who was it? - The Dumont girl, for her lesson. At this hour! It’s 11:30. I didn’t cancel! We’ll never make it by noon! We must say good-bye to Mom and go pick up Booboo. How will I manage in time? I’ll kiss Mom good-bye while you go by the school. What’d you lose? - The third movement of my concerto. This is a disaster! - You know it by heart. Still, it’s annoying. - What if they really love us? - Who? Our carnies. I don’t know. - They’re sweet. - Yes, they are. What about your foreigner? Vanished. Maybe I dreamed him up. And your painter? - He’s in Germany. - Expecting someone? - No, but now we’re really late. Solange, you must come right away. Where? To my shop. Andy’s back and waiting for you. - Now? - Right now. He’s just passing through. But we’re so late already, and I must pick up my brother at school. Maybe he could go. The school’s right nearby. It’d help us out. - How can you? Of course I will! Ask for Booboo. He’s a little redhead. Impossible! I can’t go! I’m scared stiff! I’ll see him in Paris. - Nonsense. Go on. - Yes, go on. - I’m shaking. It’s so crazy! Not even a hello? What a difference. I mean, from the uniform. I’m out, Yvonne. Time to live. - I thought they’d keep you in, - given the news. - What news? You seen the papers? Trouble all over. Come on! Dutrouz may be a pessimist, but you? Speak of the devil. Look at this. He’s the sadist. A crime of passion. For 40 years she turned him down. Sure, it was aggravating, but that’s no reason to carve her up. I guess he cut her down to size. Well, I’m off. To Paris? You may run into my daughters. I met one the other day... Solange. And your ideal? It’ll have to wait. My picture’s at the gallery. Go see it sometime. Let me kiss you good-bye. Good-bye, Maxence. Hi, Mom. - So you’re really off? - About time! - Solange isn’t coming by? - I came for both of us. I guess you can’t go get Booboo. He’s in good hands. A friend, Mr. Dame, went for him. Lucky he came by. What’d you say? Mr. Dame? Simon Dame. A silly name, but a nice man. I have to go out. Gramps is asleep. Josette isn’t back. Watch the place. But I can’t! They’re waiting for me. Be right back. Yvonne! My paper! You hear me? I forgot my bag. Somebody there? The foreigner... Are you Andy? - That’s me. - Where’d you find that music? - In the street. I looked all over. So did I. I looked all over for you. Yvonne! You’re here. How was Mexico? Lovely, Simon. - Where’re you going? - Paris. We’ll go in my car. At 140 mph, it’ll take four hours. I’m in no hurry. Forget about that painter. I’ll go to Germany if I must, but I’ll find him. Good luck, then. - Tell me where he is. - Paris. "Paris is small for a great passion like yours." You’re sure to run into him on the boulevards. Hurry. We’ve been waiting. - Solange isn’t here? - Too bad! But we were to meet at noon. It’s nearly half past. Get in. Wait for a minute. Here she comes. - No, it’s Josette. - Wait for me. Take me along. I want to see Paris. Hop in. We go from place to place across rivers and valleys They call us carnies The road is our home base
