Turn on Waze because... I'm not so sure we are going the right way. I don't have signal. I told you to turn it on a while back. Turn it it on now and look for signal! I don't have signal, I told you already! How am I supposed to get signal here? I got signal! No, I lost it. - Should I turn around? - No, no, no. Yes, I'll turn around right here. Let's keep going, it's dangerous. I can back up here... It's so hot. Look out, there is a turn right there. I know how to drive, Paco! Do you want to drive the fucking car? I'm just asking you to be careful, Luisa. It was somewhere around here. - Let me know if a car is coming. - You're good. This must be more dangerous at night. You have reached your destination. And now what? I don't know, it's wrong. It's not here. Wait, don't get out of the car. Why? I don't know. I was told she can't share the wifi because we're not guests. Really? Now what? I don't know. Let's go. Let me ask her. She said no. I told you... Too bad. You have reached your destination. - Is that your brother? - It's my brother. You are a bit of an asshole. What's wrong with you? - What's up? - Hi. Paco, Gabino, Gabino, Paco. Nice to meet you, how are you? Nice to meet you. Is it here? You haven't been before? - No? - No. - Did you just get here? - Yes. They're not home? Nobody opened the door. So I guess not. When were you last here? Around three years ago. No, before that... When our parents first moved in here. I helped them move. We painted the house... We fixed the wiring... We planted the trees out here. That one was here already, but... the little ones. They're probably out. Yes. You are also an actor? That's right. - That's how you met? - Yes. What do you do? I studied biology, but now I work for an agency. That's cool. What kind of agency? A normal one. Do you have an extra cigarette? No, this is my last one. I'm going to look for a store to buy some cigarettes. Do you want me to buy you a pack? Yes. I got you. I want a beer, but a light one. Don't worry about it. Did you tell them you were coming? - Mom! - Hello. - How are you? - Good. - Hi. - Hi, son. Thank you! Did you come together? No. Come in. Cigarettes? - I ran out. - Don't you have any? No. Sir? Excuse me... They don't have any cigarettes left. Would you sell me a pack? No. They're not for me... Could you sell me just one? If there aren't any, where am I going to find more? I know there aren't any around here. I'll give you 100 pesos. - 100? - Yes, I'll give you 100 pesos for a pack of cigarettes. Alright! - Do you have change? - No. Let me see if I can break it. He doesn't have change. Do you know somewhere I can get change around here? No. But I'll give you two packs for 200. Fine. Thank you. Is Luisa here? Luisa! Someone is here for you. Yes dad, it's Paco my boyfriend. Let him in. Tere, look. Luisa brought his boyfriend, an actor from Narcos. Hello Tere, how are you? Nice to meet you. -Come in. -Thank you. -Did you meet the famous actor? -Which one? Tere, what's the name of the famous actor who appears in Narcos? I don't know. Of course you do! The handsome one that is in every other movie. Tenoch? No. Gabino must know. Gabino! Do you know...? Of course you don't! Well, whatever. Sit down. Thank you. - Do you want a beer? - Sure. I'll go get them. Gabino? Thank you. You are welcome. Thanks so much. Don't worry about it. I got it. Of course not. Really. No... Let me pay. No, really. Next time you can treat me. No, I don't want to owe you a favor just for 40 pesos. You don't owe me anything. Here, take it. The funny thing is that I paid 100 pesos for them. Why? Your dad sold them to me. How? He bought all the cigarettes in the store. So I asked him to sell me a pack... and he sold it to me for 100 pesos. Do you want me to pay you another 60 pesos? No, I was just telling you what happened. I wasn't asking you for anything. I'm not going to pay you 100 pesos for a pack of cigarettes. I didn't want you to pay for them in the first place. -Relax, I was just telling you... -No, take them back. No really, take them. Give me my 40 pesos back. It's better. This tastes weird. I tried it and it's fine, dad. It's not particularly good, but it's not bad. It is weird. Let's go out for pizza. Or to Tacos Tony. No, let's go to The Oasis. Yes, let's go. The Oasis is a good idea. Last time I went to Los Panchos... I had terrible diarrhea. It's good we didn't go there. Do you remember Tere? The little joint next to the store... Garden of Delights. I also got very sick there. What character do you play? What? What character do you play? Francisco Arellano Felix. Cheers. Do it. What? Do a scene. No, what do you mean? Are you an actor, or aren't you an actor? Yes, but I can't just do it. Sure you can. I don't know if Luisa told you... This season I don't have dialogues. Later my character grows, and I'll have some dialogues... But this season I had no dialogues. It doesn't matter, just do it. That's it. What do you mean? That was my scene. It didn't have dialogues. I didn't have dialogues. The scene did have dialogues, but... That's what I was telling you, I didn't say anything this season. Exactly, you didn't say anything. But next season I will have some dialogues. Do one with dialogues. But I didn't have any. I didn't have dialogues. Make one up. What do you mean? Do it. I think he is upset. It was no big deal... No, you were being nice about it, but... I think he didn't like you asking. Too bad. As you can see my issues with the government are resolved. It was just a misunderstanding. I’ve secured their cooperation. They’re my partners again. Which of course I’m glad to share with you. That’s what friends are for, right? Remember when we brought the plazas together to sell weed? We were so small. But… my ideas were new. No one saw it coming. And we grew fast. Along the way, we lost good men. Caro. Neto. I’ll carry them in my heart, always. I hope you never forget them… or the lessons they left us with. Because when we lose our way, things get thrown off balance. The fuck-ups start… We do stupid shit, right? They called us ‘La Familia.’ Sure, ‘cause we started off so small. But now, with the arrangements I’ve made with the government, I’m more powerful than any trafficker in Mexico. Today, we become ‘La Federacion’. And you all are welcome. Thank you for your trust. That's all. Do it again. What? -Do it again. -This? Yes, didn't you hear me? But I did it already. Yes, one more time. But don't go that far. Just start here. -I might as well... -What for? To do the entire scene. Mom. Mom! What's going on? I'm nervous. I cannot sleep. I have an audition... I'll help you tomorrow. Sleep. Where did my dad take Paco and Gabino? I already told you I don't know. I want you to help me with my lines. Yes... Right now. What a terrible combination... of emotions and confusion... and destruction. Everything is possible and will be done in the name of love and care. The daughter will inherit the mother's wounds. The daughter will suffer for the failures of the mother. The unhappiness of the mother will be the unhappiness of the daughter. It is as if the umbilical cord had never been cut. Is that how it is, mom? Mom... Is that how it is? I lost it... Mom, Is that how it is? Is the daughter's unhappiness the mother's triumph? Mom... Is my sadness your secret pleasure? What do you think? You are beautiful. You didn’t like it. I didn't say I didn’t like it. I would do it differently. But that doesn’t mean you didn’t do it well. Why don’t you tell me how to do it? Paco says I do it great. This is how I would do it. What a terrible combination ... of emotions and confusion... and destruction. Everything is possible and will be done in the name of love and care. The daughter will inherit mother's wounds. The daughter will suffer for the mother's failures. The unhappiness of the mother will be the unhappiness of the daughter. It is as if the umbilical cord had never been cut. Mom... Is that how it is? Is the unhappiness of the daughter the triumph of the mother? Mom... Is my sadness your secret pleasure? Luisa! Mom. Mom! What? Mom! Should I open the door for him? No, it's Gabino, he's probably drunk. I'm going to have to make his bed. I'd rather not. Mom! Shut up! What's wrong with you? Look at you! You vomited all over yourself! No, the waitress from Oasis threw my breakfast all over me. She did it on purpose. Do you know who she is? She is the daughter of Rosendo Mendieta... The man who disappeared during the miner's strike. I didn't know. Do you have cigarettes? I don't smoke. -Are my dad and your boyfriend back? -Yes. Can you steal a cigarette from him? Yes, I can. But you cannot come in looking like that. If mom sees you she's going to be upset. Get me a shirt and I'll wait here. Sure. Where is your bag? I didn't bring any clothes. You are an idiot. I'm going to have to ask Paco for a shirt and a cigarette. Is it good? What? Your book. It's ok. Thank you. When are you leaving? Tomorrow, or the day after. You? Probably tomorrow. Are you still dating that girl...? What's her name? Who? What was her name? The blonde one... Last time I saw her she fell really hard on her tailbone. No. We broke up eleven months ago. I forgot you had met. You went to the theater with her, remember? That's right. I think mom's up. What's this? What's it about? A guy... A guy arrives to a town looking for man. But he doesn't know why he is looking for him. Does he have a picture of the man? I don't know. I haven't read that far. He arrives... and it's a mystery... Why is he looking for him? Who sent him there? You don't know anything. The man arrives to the town... He stays at a hotel... where he meets a woman. I imagine she is going to be his love interest. Or something like that. But that's as far as I've gotten. I don't really know what's going to happen next. I'm sorry. I thought this room was empty... I don't have a towel, so I took this one. I didn't know you were here. I'm sorry. Yes? Hi. A man broke into my room. I was hoping to speak to the manager... Did you leave the door open? No. I'm pretty sure it was locked. Let me speak to the manager, please. I'm here by myself. The owner is my dad, and he is not here. Can I switch rooms? There aren't any available rooms. My sister is the one that cleans the rooms, but she is not here. But I can give you another room this afternoon. Alright. Can you give me a new one? The guy grabbed it. He claims he hasn't got a towel. I'd rather have a clean one, please. Leave this one with me, and I'll bring one over to your room. I'll drop by in the afternoon to switch rooms. Come in the aftrenoon. Excuse me, sir? Did you walk into someone else's room by mistake? No. You didn't try to steal the towel from another room. No. That's weird. A guest claims that a man that looks like you broke into her room. It must be a misunderstanding. But how did she describe me? She just said... That someone like you... But what were the characteristics? That someone exactly like you... But what words did she use? Normal words. But what words? Skinny, brown skin, just like you. I wanted to say sorry... for scaring you yesterday. Okay. It was not my intention... I was just walking by... and saw the door wide open... So I thought there was no one there. And since I didn't have a towel, I thought I'd take it. It's okay. Don't worry about it. Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but I still feel terrible about... scaring you. I want it to be super clear that... That it was a misunderstanding. Yes, no worries. Thank you. Really, I'm sorry. Did you get clean towels? Yes. I mean... Yesterday I went to the reception, but there was no one there. That's when I... walked into your room... Yes, I got that. The thing is that... I was grossed out by the towel you had touched. So I brought it to reception, I asked for a new one... I was told they didn't have any... They promised to bring me one, but they haven't. I was left without a towel. Are you from around here? What does that have to do with anything? I'm looking for a man. Rosendo Mendieta, do you know him? Yes. I know who he is. I used to be from here. Lots of people from here left. It's all new people now. What are we going to do about it? About what? My towel. I don't know. Do you know where I can find Rosendo? It's best if you stop looking for him. Let me know if you get clean towels. Rosendo Mendieta is on the line. -Gabino? -Yes. I know you have been asking for me. What are you looking for? It’s dangerous for you to go around asking for me. Almost everyone thinks I'm dead. But I'm close to your hotel. If you want we can meet. Rosendo Mendieta? Yes. Where do we meet? In the hotel's restaurant. Oasis? Yes, I'll be there right away. Can’t we meet somewhere more private? Don't worry. Oasis is always empty. See you in ten minutes. Hello. Can I sit here? I'm waiting for someone. We all fit, no? I don't know... Do you have a date with a woman? If I'm here it'll be less formal. Are you nervous? Sorry, I didn't introduce myself. I'm Paco. Do you want a beer? I'm waiting for someone and I'd rather be alone when... Excuse me! Can I get a beer, please? Two beers! Thank you. Really, I have to be alone. It's a meeting... You think she’ll think we’re faggots? The only one that looks like a homosexual is you. One for me and the other one for the skinny guy. Aren't you scared of asking around for Rosendo Mendieta? You really thought he was going to come? You thought he was going to come! He is not going to come. Rosendo Mendieta is missing. Disappeared. You really think it was him on the phone? Or are you starting to realize that you spoke to me? Rosendo Mendieta is missing. Most likely he is dead. Nobody has see him in two years. Everybody knows him, but no one is going to say anything. Wanna see? Excuse me! Do you know Rosendo Mendieta? See? -She doesn't know him? -Of course she does! I just told you everyone knows him, but no one will say anything. Do you know each other? More or less. Are you going to eat? No. I'll have something to drink. A beer, please. How are you? I'm good. No, that's not true. I'm going to tell you how I really feel. I'm going to tell you what is bothering me. It's not the sickness. I can live with that. It's something else. It's a great necessity. It's an anxiety. That's what happens. I forget what it is. But it should be important, right? What is? How do you feel? How should you feel? That's what happens. I forget. And I know what it is. I have to discover it... It's a necessity, an anxiety. Guilt. Right? No, if it is guilt it would be horrible. It is horrible. No, if it is guilt it would be horrible. Just say it: I'm guilty. No, no. If I died today... I'd die clean. I have never... I... I'm a positive person. I'm the type to look at the bright side of all things. Right? -Hi. -Hi. I need a favor. Can I come in? I came here to save my sister… from her boyfriend and his family. I haven’t seen her in three months. Tomorrow afternoon we were supposed to meet here. But I know she's going to ask me to leave her alone. The thing is… I wanted to ask you to... meet her in place of me. I want you to talk to her, and help her get out of here. I wouldn't know where to begin. It will be easy. Like making a new friend. I'll leave you some money... You can have dinner, you can take her dancing... Whatever you want. Don't worry about the money. I don't know... I am... A coward. Exactly. That's why I promise... to do everything in my power to help you. She's coming tomorrow. I said I'd wait for her in the lobby. My sister doesn't smoke. I mean, she doesn't buy cigarettes herself. But when she sees someone smoking, she smokes. So, tomorrow at five in the afternoon... wait by the entrance... light up a smoke... She is going to walk right by you. She is going to walk into the lobby. She is going to ask for me. I'm not going to answer. She's going to get impatient. She is going to walk outside... and then she'll ask you for a smoke. What is her name? Fauna. What do I say to her? Just talk to her. About what? Whatever you want. Let's try this. You are at the hotel entrance. Pretend to light a cigarette. I'm Fauna. At first don't look at her, ignore her. Can I have a cigarette? Of course. Are you waiting for someone? Yes. What a coincidence. What a coincidence. Because… I never buy cigarettes. This morning, for some reason, I felt like buying cigarettes. Now I'm smoking because I have cigarettes... and you come here asking for a cigarette, and it's an excuse to get to know you. No, I can't start with a lie. -Start what? -Talking to you. The truth is I smoke a lot. Can't you think of anything better? Are you from around here? Do you come often to the hotel? No, not often. Who are you waiting for? My sister. What's her name? Maybe I know her. I doubt it. If she is staying here maybe I know her, there aren't many guests. Flora. What's so funny? Nothing. Do you have a boyfriend? Here is a towel and soap. Should I leave yours here or in your room? In my room. Thanks. Do you have a boyfriend? I do, but he is an idiot. His dad owns the mine. They are assassins. They've killed many people in this town in order to have a mine here. Your sister wouldn't say that. I mean, that's what you think, but I doubt Fauna would say that. How do you know what my sister thinks? I don't know. I just don't imagine her telling me all that stuff just like that. Hey... Are you really named Flora and Fauna? Yes, why? It's funny, no? Should we get back to it? Four beers! One beer! -Light or dark. -Dark. And then? They exit the bar and get into Fauna's boyfriend's car. He doesn't know where they are taking him. Hours pass and he falls asleep. He wakes up in the middle of a field. He can see lights in the distance. They are miners going to work. He finds it strange to find them in the middle of the night. Unsure of himself he starts walking in any direction. He walks for a long time in pitch darkness. Suddenly he realizes someone is following him. He tries to run away. But gets run over and loses consciousness. He wakes up in Fauna's boyfriend's car. What happened? I don't know. It's not clear. That's as far as I've gotten. Let me see the book? You can keep it. Don't you want to finish it? No, you keep it. Thanks. Sometime you can tell me the ending. Can I tell you something? Yes. Come closer.
