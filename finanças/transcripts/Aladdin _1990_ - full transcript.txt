Mei Ling: It was only a game, my father. Sometimes my attendants and I, pretend that a handsome suitor comes and asks for my hand in marriage. I know. I have been selfish. You are my only child and I have not wanted to part with you. But it is time I allowed you to marry. We must find you the richest man in all of China! But they are all so old and unattractive! What does that matter? The man who brings the most jewels and gold will be your husband. Emperor: And also, this is the custom. He must bring me a great gift as well! Mei Ling: Yes, my father. Now, I must see that an announcement is sent throughout all of China! (gong chimes) Mei Ling: Aladdin? Now I heard what your father said. Soon you will be married to the richest man in China. And I will never see you again. Now I am very sad. If I were to bring you jewels and gold and a great gift for your father, would you marry me? Oh, yes! Then I would be truly happy! But that can never happen for I am only the son of a poor tailor with nothing to offer you but this kite. May I keep it? Please? Mei Ling... I may never see you again but I will never forget you.

But my father died a short time ago. Died? Died? (gasps) Oh, no! No, say it isn't true! Why do you weep, sir? How can you ask such a question? I am your father's brother! My father's brother? I've just returned from a long exile in Arabia hoping to see him once again and... (sobs) Now you tell me that... Died? Then you must be my uncle! Yes! Your long lost uncle. Now, tell me nephew, where is your house and your lovely mother, my brother's widow? Is she still alive? It's just down the street, sir, where the lantern hangs from a post. Ah! Here. Take these gold coins to your mother and present me to her at once. This way, my uncle! Aladdin: Mother? Mother? I bring you good news. My uncle is back from his travels and he sends you his greeting. Oh. (snaps) You are making fun of me. No, mother. You had an uncle once but he died long ago and I don't recall another. But he must be my uncle for when I told him of my father's death he wept bitterly. Then he embraced me and he bade me give you these gold coins! Oh! Well, Aladdin! Where did you get these? He waits outside. He wishes to meet you! But there are so many of them! Please enter, my uncle. Wife of my brother! How good it is to see you at last! Forty years ago when I was (chuckling) just a boy, myself, I... I left this city and have lived ever since in Arabia. But today I returned and seeing this dear boy in the streets I recognized him at once as my nephew. He did mother, just as he says! (laughing) Yes. Just as... (clears throat) Please, I... I wish to see where my... My brother used to sit for his meals. Here. Here? Here? (sobbing and moaning) Oh, my dear brother that I shall never see you again in this life! Well! You are welcome, oh brother of my late husband. May I serve you some tea? Yes, thank you. Now, my nephew, tell me what trade do you follow?

Now listen to me, beneath this stone is a cave, a cave which contains an enchanted treasure. I will give you magic words to open that cave. You will then enter and do as I bid. You will not go with me? No, no. I-- I must remain here and guide you through your journey. There's nothing to fear, Aladdin. Nothing to fear. Is there? -No, uncle. -Good. Now, stand here. Right on this very spot next to the rock. There. Repeat after me. Mystic spirit within this rock open as I knock, knock, knock! Go on, go on. Do it. -"Mystic spirit..." -Yes, within this rock. -"Within this rock." -Open. "Open as I knock, knock, knock!" (sound of huge locks opening) (stones grinding) Didn't I tell you, there's nothing to fear? Yes, uncle. Now, climb down that ladder to the bottom of the cave. This lamp will light your way. My voice will guide you through the halls of the cavern. You must return before the sands run out. Richest man in all China, Aladdin. Hmm? Your wealth awaits you, down there. I suppose this is the path I must follow. You are now passing the Altar of the Golden Jars. They are filled with gold coins. But beware! Lest you touch them... Magician: Now, proceed to the next hall! Magician: The chimes are magic but they cannot be touched or your limbs will be frozen and you'll remain there for all eternity. Hurry, Laddie. Hurry! Magician: You have come to the third hall. You will see... a lamp! Bring that lamp to me! Get the lamp, Aladdin! The magic lamp is mine! I've come all this way for a dusty old lamp? Hurry, Aladdin. Hurry! Hurry! Hurry, Aladdin! Hurry! Aladdin: Uncle! Uncle, I'm here! Help me, uncle! Give it, Aladdin, then I'll help you out! Can I let go of the lamp? The lamp! Give me the lamp! (grunting) I cannot reach it! Give it to me! Give me the lamp! Aladdin: Help me! The gateway is closing! Give it to me! Reach! Reach! Help me! Help! No! No! No! Help! Help me! (stones grinding) Ah! You fool! You're trapped in that cave and soon you'll starve and die! Help! Help! (laughing manically) Help me! Help! Aladdin: Help! (gasps) Oh! Maid: What is it, Princess? I thought I heard someone cry for help. You were only dreaming, Princess. Perhaps dreaming of the boy who gave you the kite? Yes, Aladdin! But I fear he is in trouble. In the dream he was running and crying out. That is an easy dream to explain, your highness. What do you mean? You dreamed Aladdin has a new kite and is running with it through the hills. But why would he cry out? With joy, your highness. Running with his kite and crying out for joy! Help! Help! Help! (coughing) Hello? Help me! (knocking on the door) It's only me, Mrs. So and So. I brought you some delicious rice cakes for breakfast! Oh, that's very kind of you. He still hasn't returned? I shouldn't have let him go. (sighs) Aladdin may be lazy but he's a clever boy. I can't imagine any scrape he could not get out of. I hope you're right. And he hasn't been gone that long. I know he's having a wonderful adventure! Help! Can anyone hear me? Oh. It's no use. I will die just as my uncle said. Why did my uncle become so angry at me? Just because I wouldn't give him this lamp. It can't be worth very much. Unless... Maybe it's solid gold underneath all of this dust!
