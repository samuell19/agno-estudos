The one who has already read addresses those who haven't read yet and offers them a piece of writing as an invitation to read. So I give the floor to Lucio. Thank you very much, Martín. I read... "I travel the air with a hand guided by the breath of an angel that insists on searching for what is his." I was thinking of what Martín said a while ago, thinking of this point in time where language is so standardized, more standardized than ever, and where, paradoxically, an excess of communication ends up isolating us from ourselves. I think about the importance of writing and reading poetry nowadays. And here comes the contradiction... For whom do we write? Who reads poetry today? Okay, thanks, Lucio. I'm sure they'll all run to buy the book now. Right? - You're flattering me. - Yes, I'm flattering you with admiration. Thank you very much. I liked it a lot, Mari. - Thanks. - Honestly, it surprised me. In a good way. - It better! - I was a bit scared that you'd read it. Why? Because you're fierce. - Hey, Mariela... - Oh! - What? - You never like anything. - See? - Hey, Martín! Says the destroyer of the new Argentine narrative. Don't compare me... "Don't compare me..." We're among friends. - If it's not good... - You really liked it? I liked it a lot, Mari. Truly. - Great. - Yes. - Are you writing anything now? - Yes. Well, I'm trying. Well, he takes his time. You know? - He likes stopping, then going back. - I'm not a genius like her. Well, seize the moment. You have time now. Something will turn up. Unbelievable. Who invited him? I invited him. I couldn't not invite him. Why did you invite him? This is an awkward situation for me. Please. Take the chance to talk. Try to make peace. Talk about what? I mean it. What would we talk about? He screwed me over. He did not. He beat you at the contest, that's all. You're taking his side? That professorship wasn't gonna solve your life, right? - Okay. - What? I'm not gonna ruin your night. - Thanks. - Well, I've got to pick up Sol. Go on. Our girl should go to bed early. Bye. My dear Mariela! Welcome. How are you? Thanks. - I didn't make it, sorry. - Oh, don't worry about it. THE SUBSTITUTE Good morning. The main office? - Upstairs, down the corridor. - Thanks. Last signature right here. Okay. - There. - Do you have the student list? - No, not yet. - Okay, give me a sec. Professor Garmendia. Hi, any trouble getting here? I'm Amalia. Amalia! Hello. - Let's go to the classroom. - I'm waiting for the list. - Yes. - How's your dad? Coping. We're all a bit worried about him. Yes, but he'll be fine. Yes, of course, he'll be fine. I know from experience. Besides, he's a fighter. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. That's how it is. Yes. - Okay, dear. Thanks. Let's go. - All right. Thanks. Regretfully, it happens. Sometimes teachers don't show up either. See? These kids have a free period. Of course. Yes. Good morning! Morning. Hi, how are you? Well, this is Professor Garmendia. He's substituting for Professor Jarkowski. - Hi. Good morning to you all. - Morning. Here's the list. - Thanks. - Let me know if you need anything. Okay. Thanks. Can anyone tell me what literature is for? Anyone? To make us go to sleep. Anything else? Your name? - Karen. - Karen? - Yes. - What about you? - I don't read. - You don't like reading? No, not at all. Uh... Yes? Literature is used to tell stories. Your name? - Mayomi. - Mayomi. That's true now. We don't only need literature to tell stories, right? - Your name? - Dilan. What do you think literature is for? For nothing. Say it a bit louder and see if our friend back there wakes up. I said literature is good for nothing. He's almost awake. Almost. Okay, your classmate says literature is good for nothing. And I think he's right. I agree. Literature is actually of no use to us. It has no use. It isn't a good. We can't eat it. We can't breathe it. We can't buy anything with literature. Right? In practical terms, it's completely dispensable. Then, why come? What are you doing here? - Your name? - Kevin. Kevin. To give some sense to the classes we spend together. Okay. I want you to grab a piece of paper and write the things you like and don't like. And include your name. For instance, "I'm Dilan. I like trap, and I don't like your class." Something like that. Great, Dilan. Expand on it a bit more, but that's the idea. Excuse me. Where is the teacher's lounge? - Hi, yes. I'll take you there. - Okay. I'll introduce you to the others. I'm Clara, biology teacher. - Welcome. - Thanks. I'm Lucio, literature substitute. Yes, I know who you are. You do? Aren't you the Chilean's son? Oh, yes, I am. Hello! - How's it going? - Hi. This is Lucio. He's substituting for Aníbal. - Hi! - Welcome, Lucio. I'm Nando. - How are you? - I'm here if you need me. - Morning. - Want some tea? Great. Thanks. Do you have a mug? - I didn't bring one. - We have some. Okay, thanks. I'm Florencia. Welcome. - How are you? - Fine. - Matías, Nadia, José. - Welcome. Have you read Facundo by Sarmiento? Yes, Civilization and Barbarism. Welcome to barbarism. - My goodness! - Hey, don't scare him away. There's also food here if you wanna eat. - Great. - Help yourself. How were your first hours? Good. A bit unfocused at first, but then they seemed to connect. This obviously isn't college. No. LA ISLA COMMUNITY KITCHEN Okay, now. Wait. We'll leave it, and you take care of it. Okay, get going. Beat it. Scram! - We're going. - Get the hell out of here. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - What's the problem? - Jonny! Open the car. Do it, please. - What's up? - Open the car. - I don't want this paint. - What? Take them to the car. - Come on. - Who sent them? - It's fine, let me. - Okay. Open up. There you go. All of them, quickly. Well, I'll put the tables here. We're fixing the restrooms, and... I've got to paint. Then why didn't you accept the cans they brought? I want nothing to do with that jerk. - Who is he? - Olmos, the Dog. - Who's this Dog that makes you so nervous? - A drug dealer. - Oh, look! - A drug dealer? Look at the new kitchen I got. What's up? - Hi, Roberto. - How's the food? Good? - Afternoon. - Good. Good afternoon. When it's ready, I'll feed at least 100 people daily. - Hey, what a surprise! - Professor, what are you doing here? You know each other? He's my student. - Really? - Uh-huh. - You should give him a good grade. - Let's see if he earns it. Watch out. He's tough. - I'll go grab my lab results. - Yeah. - Is he your dad, Professor? - Uh-huh. I can see the resemblance. - Nah! - Sort of. I'm cuter. You have more hair. Okay, here it is. - Let's go. It's late. - It's coming out nice. - See you later. - Bye. - Bye, Professor. - See you. - Got everything? - Yes. Dog! I'm leaving your stuff here. What the fuck's wrong with him? That clown's playing for Mayor Suárez. Asshole! VOTE FOR OLMOS Has the Dog been in the neighborhood long? For a while. He's creeping his way in little by little. He's actually running for mayor. He wants to beat Suárez for mayor. Does he stand a chance? Well, anything's possible in this world, son. Don't you have anything to tell me? Did the kids listen to you? Yes. Well, they humiliated me a bit. That's just the way they are. They have to play tough. Otherwise, they eat each other alive. Stand your ground, be stern. There may be complicity, but draw boundaries above all else. Let them know you're on their side and care about them. Not only that you care about them, but also their surroundings, their family. It's late. I hope we don't miss our turn... We won't miss it. - Hurry, we're running late, Dad! - I'm trying. It makes me happy you're teaching in the neighborhood. Then do your part. I am, aren't I? No, Dad. You've got to slow down. But I'm taking things slowly. It'll do you good. You think so? Of course. Getting to know those kids... Hi, Mr. Roberto. You can come in now. Thanks, honey. No one gets saved by himself, son. Miss, hey, I was here before him. His turn is before yours, ma'am. I don't understand how this works. I was here an hour ago, and someone else goes in. Why? He had an appointment, ma'am. Your turn is next. It's always the same. People cut in line, and no one says a thing. This is such a mess. "If I had to choose, I'd choose this health of knowing we're so ill, this joy of being so unhappy." "If I had to choose, I'd choose this innocence of not being naive, this purity I maintain for being dirty." "If I had to choose, I'd choose this love with which I hate, this hope that eats desperate bread." "What happens, people, is I'm wagering death." Juan Gelman. Okay. Impressions? Any feelings? Anyone who wants to share? Any thoughts about the poem? Romina, no phones, please. I've told you. I don't know how it was with Jarkowski, but no phones in this class. Okay, now, anyone? Mayomi? Frankly, I didn't understand much. It's not about understanding. First thing that comes to mind. - Kevin? - May I go to the bathroom? Answer this, and you may go to the bathroom. I think I can hold it. Okay, thanks. Karen? What? What are your thoughts about what I read? About the poem? I got lost as soon as you started. I'm not interested. Our pal isn't gonna wake up? He works at a textile factory at night. He'll never pay attention. - What's his name? - Richar. Richar. To Borja, poetry was the expression of beauty through artistically intertwined words. Well, I see poetry isn't something that motivates you very much. Uh... Those who didn't hand in your work last class, hand it in now. Next class... Next class, I'll bring other things to read. Thanks, put your name on it. Bye. Thanks. "You would have." Second-person singular, imperfect tense. Mood? Uh... indicative mood. No, honey. Subjunctive. It's the mood of possibilities, of wishes. I wanna live in that mood. Come on, honey. Focus. Don't be a fatalist. Come on. I can't take it anymore. Okay, eat something. It'll give you some energy. You've got to stop being afraid. Forget about the world of possibilities. "If I could, if I couldn't." Come to the world of facts, to the world of action. - What mood is it? - Stop. What mood is it? Tell me what mood it is. Shut up! Imperative mood. I won't go to that school! No, Sol Garmendia is going to that school. Indicative mood. - No, I'm not going! - Come... Sol. Sol, come here! - Hi, darling. How did it go? - Leave me alone, Mom! Okay. So intense. Yes, her hormones are all over the place. But she's a little girl. She's not that little. It was my night off. Yes, I'm sorry. Now you have the night off. Bye. Who is it? Your next-door neighbor. - Hello. - Hi. You're new, right? Yes. My wall is clattering. It's a bit late to be drilling. Yes, I'm sorry. I didn't realize it. Okay, thanks. - No, sorry. - Bye. Good night. Does anyone know what the crime genre is? Can anyone think of an example? Karen? If my brother was killed a year ago, and no one knows who did it, does it count as a crime genre? Uh, yes. Yes, I'm so sorry, Karen. I didn't know. And how could I start writing about it? Uh, well, for starters, you'd need to have a mystery, something in the shadows, unknown. And then leads that an investigator could follow to solve the case. That could be it. - Would it be about a cop? - Not necessarily. No, the investigator can be... It could be you. The investigator in the story. Walter. - Yes? - How are you? Literature class. Okay? Any examples of what we're talking about? - I don't know, sir. - Throw out an example. Come on. Should I write it down? - Say it in your own words. - You know this. Say it in my words? I'll make the entire class get up and clap. - Yes, do it. - Go on, dude. - Want me to say it? - Yes. You'll hear all these people get motivated With my rhymes Sit down, take a seat, I'll tell you That, to me, those stories are true 'Cause in literature class It seems to me it's all madness Huh? This is serious! And we'll unveil all that is mysterious About how they killed Karen's brother About how they had him shot in the back Huh? It doesn't seem right to me Wake up, kid, you've been asleep For a couple of months We're here, improvising What is it that's happening? What story am I telling? Can't you see it? We've been doing this for months No nonsense, the things that I say I'll make the class shake You'll see I'll have to get better than an A Thank you. Thanks. - Thanks, Walter. - You're welcome, sir. You can count on me, Professor. The Chilean helped me with everything. I owe it to him. Okay. Thanks, Dilan. Did my dad ask you to help me? The book you read the other day was good. - You liked it? - Is this it? Yes. It's really good. I was listening. It's good. Want to take it home? No, I don't read much. Well, give it a try. Take it. Take good care of it. I love it. - Okay, Professor. See you. - Okay. - Hello, Professor. - Hi. I left the sheet music at Mom's. I'm sick of having two homes. Well, it could be worse. Some kids have no home. I'll finish this, and we'll go get it. Will it take long? A little while. Come on. Take me to Mom's so I can get my sheet music. Play something else. - That's what I want to play. - Well... There are lots of things I want too. Adjust to what can be done. "When my mom's boyfriend hits her, I feel like killing him." "Juan." Poor kid. Listen, this one's nice. "It happened yesterday. It also happened today." - "Spring is gone." - I like that one. Right? "I like weed, booze, and cumbia." "I hate cops. Motherfuckers." Name? "Anonymous poet." What's up? Beat it. Is that yesterday's loot? I'm not smart. You created a different impression the other day. - Hi, good evening. - Good evening. Karen. What? Did you write anything about your brother? No, I couldn't. - Nothing? - Nothing at all. Romina? No, Professor, I couldn't. - Not a single paragraph? - I'm made of rubber. Well, it's not you guys. We're all losing our ability to write beyond devices, social networks, and stuff. Are you against social networks? I'd like to see your Instagram, Professor. Some reggaeton from Miami? Bring anything, Kevin? Of course I did, Professor. I'm shocked. I'll tell you about my character. Dedicated to you. My character is called the "Nosy Turtle." "He butts into his students' lives all day long." - Like it? - Great, very nice. I know another turtle. You do? Really? It's so slow. It's always late for class. Okay, who else? Dilan? I didn't write anything. He's lying. He wrote something. - He did? - Yes, it's about his old man. It's cool. - Care to read it? - No, I don't wanna, sir. I could read it. No, we won't force anyone. Want to read it, Dilan? Come on, dude. - Come on, Dilan. - Fine, I'll read it. "In the hood, he was called the 'Watchmaker.'" "He entered the night without rest." "He worked to feed his family but never knew if he'd make it back home." "His was a high-risk job." "I liked seeing him clean his weapon." "That day, the Watchmaker, when they were inside, pointing their guns at the factory workers while he waited for them to open the safe, he had a bad premonition." "He turned around, and his friends were gone." "A guard shot him as he went inside." "He sighed at the realization that he had lost this time." "He did it with dignity and pride." "Today, his name is written on this city's streets." What's going on? All I ask is you be respectful. What are they doing? - The principal is coming. - Come. They found drugs in the men's restroom. We need to search all the boys. Come, girls, please. You're coming with me. Come on. Let's go. - Why? - Come on. Relax. No need to worry. Let's go. Girls, go with Amalia for a sec. - What's gonna happen with the boys? - This is terrible! Good afternoon. From this moment on, this is a search. - Why? - Nobody talks. Nobody touches their belongings, and everyone stands next to their desk. I won't do as they say, Professor. I'm not doing anything. I'm at school. Can't you see? - Kid... - This is a school. Don't touch anything, sir. Get up. - If I may, I'll search one side. - But there's nothing on us. When you talk, talk to me. Stay still. - Keep your hand still. - We've stolen nothing. - If you have nothing, it'll be quick. - How about this? Is this your schoolbag? - This is disrespectful. - You, get up. Go on. - It's school stuff. - Give me the pencil case. There's nothing there. - May I? - No, you may not. An eraser. - Please give me your pouch. - Wait. May I? There's nothing in it. What is this? What is it? Can't you see? Why do you have this at school? Okay. Witnesses, come with me. We'll proceed and seize this substance. Doctor, clonazepam. Clonazepam and two tubes with a white substance. Okay, I'll need your name and ID number, please. Walter. 41-583-77. Your full name, please. Walter Medina. You going through our stuff is crap. - Guys. Kevin. - I won't shut up. - Kevin. - We didn't do anything. We're at school. - Kevin. - Don't use that tone! - Do you have his info? - I do. We can process him. - You're coming with us. - Let's go. - Why? - Come on, move. Wait, come on. - Don't let him near me. - I have rights, don't I? Kid, don't use that tone. Please, calm down. Can't you understand? You can't do this, sir. - You just can't do this. - Hey, kid... - No. - Kiddo. - Come. - Guys, calm down. No, they can't take us. - We're underage. Our parents need to know. - Relax. They can't do this. No, Professor... - Wait a sec. - You can't take him. Witness, come here. - We found it in the toilet. - Where's Amalia? I don't know. Write it down for the record. We found pills. We're weighing some cocaine. That's it. Keep going. Do you have any idea what this is? Can you see how much it is? Tell me, how could I not report it? It's madness. Listen, they found drugs on Walter Medina. They want to take him. - Well, let his mother know. - Yes, Clara's on it. - Good. - She's calling her. 400 grams of pure cocaine. - Keep moving. - Leaving with a minor in custody. What's his name? We should've done something. This is bullshit! He's a baby! Now they've taken him, and it's all your fault. - My fault? They found it on him! - Jeez! Dilan! Dilan! Hey, wait. Come here. What's the rush? You have other things to do? No, there's nothing I need to do. I just don't want any trouble. Need a ride? I'll take you. Come on. Put your seatbelt on. Look straight ahead and relax. It's here, Professor. Wait, I don't know if I can park here. - It's okay. You can drop me off here. - Here? - Yes. - Wait. Let's talk for a minute. I can't, Professor. - Are you sure? - Yes, I can't. I've got to go. School's already over? Yes, a while ago. How's your mom? She's okay. I imagine you're going to school, right? Good afternoon. - What are you doing here, Professor? - I came for a drink. - May I? - Of course. Introduce us. - He's the Chilean's son, the professor. - Oh, the professor. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Pleasure. Want a drink? My treat. Come on. - Do you have beer? - No, coffee with cream. - Perfect. - Two coffees. - And a croissant. - Okay. Thanks. How's this kid, Susi? This kid is a son of a bitch. But he's a good kid. - Susi, I need to tell you something later. - Okay. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Holler if you need me. Have you known her long? Yes. She worked with my old man. Do you miss him? I miss my dad a lot. Why did they call him the Watchmaker? He liked stealing fancy watches. He and Susi were in the same gang. - Really? - Yeah. She can tell you good stories. Tell me one. I don't know if she'll want me to. Tell me. I'll tell you one. She says her boss wouldn't listen to her. So she cut his ear off with a kitchen knife. She sent it to her boss in a box. Okay, Professor, I've got to go. Hey, Dilan, I may look stupid, but I'm not. Okay, don't tell anyone you brought me. Fine, relax. - Who gave you the drugs? - Stay out of it. Was it Olmos, the Dog? And don't come back here. ...María Soledad Sánchez Malvier, Santos Rodolfo, as a precautionary measure of inquiry with great urgency, to stop the work until they resolve the presented issue and, in that way, provide support to the growing social conflict in the territory... - I'll make some space. - You played so well. You had fun, right? - Yes. - Yeah. - Did you like it? - I loved it. I really loved it. We all did. How are your tests going? She took her math test the other day and did really well. I didn't do well, Dad. She always says the same and ends up with straight A's. Well, I was bad at school. You weren't bad. You just don't have patience for books. - Oh! - I'm sorry. - It's fine. Don't worry. - It's okay. - I'll just... - There you go. There. - The dishes. - Are you okay? I'll bring them. It's fine. No, I'm not good with books, to be honest. - Should I serve you some meat? - I don't eat meat. Tomorrow, after the test, I'll drop her off. Study grammar with her. She's slacking. She's impossible with me. She's not being easy with me either. We just forced her to apply to a school she doesn't wanna go to. - What, "just"? She's 11. - No, she's 12. Twelve, it's all the same. We know what's best for her. - Do we? - Yes, if she... What are you two talking about? - Huh? - What's it about? - About you, what else? - Nothing. - We're obsessed. - It looks so yummy. Thanks. This is great. - I made... - You don't eat meat? - No, I don't. - Son... - I don't eat meat either. - Lucio. Who put this barbecue together? I thought you ate meat. No, no one eats meat. Well... - It's a fiasco. - One more fiasco. - Can you serve me a bit more? - Sure. Is there an extra plate there? No, I'm fine, thanks. - And salad. - What are you eating? Look, I need you to give me a few kilos of food a week. Everything's ready. I've got employees. The place is running. What? Isn't Suárez the mayor? Exactly, Suárez is the mayor running for reelection. Look, if there's space for Julio to participate, covering your needs won't be a problem. Then speak with Suárez, and then tell me what he suggests. Okay, bye. Bye, dear. I ate some when he was at the grill. Okay, fine. Want another one? Some salad. Come on. Hear what happened at the school? It's bullshit. It seems fishy. - Dilan is involved. - No. Dilan isn't stupid enough to get involved in something so shitty. I'm telling you, he's involved. So is the other kid Kevin. Do you know who sent them? Who would this be bad for? Suárez? I think it's the opposite. Suárez becomes a champion of justice, brave enough to fight drug dealing. The one who'd suffer is the Dog. He looks bad, for sure. This would bury him now that he's trying to clean his image. Are you saying Suárez's people set up the raid at school? - Maybe. - And you're involved with them? Listen, if you wanna fish, you've got to get your ass wet! Just be careful they don't use you as bait. You just don't get it. - You don't get it! - Explain it to me. She fell asleep. Yes, she was pretty tired. - Drop me off at the corner. - No, I'll take you. - I want to walk. - I'll take you, Dad. Dad? What is it, sweetie? Can I sleep here? Yes, come. What's wrong? I had a nightmare. Okay, get some rest. Tomorrow's a long day. I loved watching you play today. Sweetie, can I ask you something? Between just you and me. What do you want to know? Mom's friend, the one who came today, Sonia... Do they... Do they see each other a lot? She's her girlfriend, Dad. Didn't you realize that? Oh. Well, yeah. I thought so, but... Okay. Go to sleep. Honey, one more thing. What is it? Don't tell Mom I asked you, okay? Dad, you're so annoying. I told you I wouldn't say a thing. Fine, okay. Go to sleep. No more dealing! Say no to drugs! No more dealing! Say no to drugs! No more dealing! Say no to drugs! KEEP DEALERS OUT OF OUR SCHOOL WE WANT A SAFE SCHOOL I'm a teacher. I'm here to work. Your ID? They found a large amount here. Evidently, it's been planted, and they're using the kids. - The kids aren't dealers. - No, wait! The kids do sell drugs. They know what they're doing. - Right! - This is totally different. - This is something else. - The police can't barge in here. - The police can't come back. - No way. What message are we sending? - Drugs can flow in as much as they want? - No. Nothing will happen. Yes, something will happen. Something's happening. We're here talking. As an educational community, we must unite so it doesn't happen again. We have no authority. It's crystal clear. We do have authority. Our authority is ethical. - That's what the police are for. - No, the police are the armed authority. Our authority is ethical. But the kids buy it! What's more ethical than telling them they've gotta do things right? We must support the kids' families. Okay, the families of the kids that do things right are there. Their parents work. They work ethically, as you're saying. And you're telling them they should do as the drug dealers' parents do. - That's what you've said! - It's not good against bad. The other kids are also victims. Here they get the tools to stop falling victim to drug dealers. - Victim? - Fine, let's do this. - What? - Let's vote. There are two clear sides. Those who think they should have class like nothing is happening, and those who think we have to be on the street with the families, with our community. Those who think we should have class as usual, vote. - Okay. - Me. - See? - We're even. - My goodness! - Count them. Okay, I'm ready. The rest should vote. Could you wait for the voting to finish, José? No one finds it a bit strange... what's happening in the story? That the thief's best friend gives him up when everything's going well? Isn't that strange? It awakens some sort of intrigue. Well, that is the mystery. And the mystery is what launches the criminal plot in the story. Okay? What have you heard about Mayomi? Her parents won't let her come. Why? Because they say it's dangerous. What about Dilan? He has a cold. He's not feeling well. So is Kevin. What about Walter? Walter is just stupid. You know what's up with him? Just that he's stupid. Hi, kids. Good morning. Lucio, good morning. Please. Good morning. Mr. Benitez, this is the literature professor. - A pleasure. - He'll be observing the class. I'll go in. Excuse me. Good morning. Good morning. He's from the Ministry of Education. And? - And nothing. And what? - What's he doing here? He's here to observe the class. The school is being audited. What do you want me to do? Make me look good. How about that? Get to it. Okay. Where were we? Okay. So about the crime novel. We said that it has a mystery, right? That's where we left it. So, in this case, the mystery presents itself as a paradox. Is he here to evaluate you? No. He's here to observe. What was it? - Benitez. - Benitez. He takes notes like he knows something. He must be evaluating you. He's a bit old for this class. No, Karen. No, he's observing. He's just going to take a few notes. Can anyone tell me what a paradox is? No one? A paradox is when two ideas are apparently opposite but definitively entail a truth. Who can think of an example? "It's a blessing in disguise." Yes, there's a paradox there. Come on, guys. Don't make me look bad. "Easy come, easy go." "Easy come, easy go." Well done. Thank you, Romina. Who else? Anyone else? "Don't look a gift horse in the mouth." "Don't look a gift horse in the mouth." Yes, what would be the paradox here? No, maybe that saying doesn't have a paradox. But keep throwing them at me. We'll see which ones do and which don't. That's great, but remember to hand in your essays. Otherwise, we can't move forward. Okay? Next class, new topic. Do you understand? Sorry, excuse me. Do you have a minute, Clara? Yes. - Bye. - Goodbye. See you. How about the security invasion? Don't even ask me. The one I got... What do you need? Mayomi isn't coming to school, and I want to speak to them. But her dad is angry. I don't think it's wise. Do you know where they live? Yes. - I'll leave the visual aids. - Okay, thanks. That'll be enough. - See you tomorrow, Luna. Bye. - See you. Get some rest. Run, hurry! - Good day. - Hi, how are you? Good day. - Miriam, hi. How are you? - Professor. - How are you? - We'd like to speak with you. Can we? This is Lucio. He's Mayomi's teacher too. - Nice to meet you. - Is your husband home? Yes, he is. May we come in? - Yes. - This will only take a minute. Yes, sure. Come in. Thank you so much. She's a very good student. She must stay in school. Your argument seems perfect to me. She is a good student. A very good student. But I ask you, Clara, you're a mother... If you were going through the situation we're going through, would you send your daughter back to school? I want you to be honest and tell me. Yes, but you should trust Mayomi. She won't get involved in anything fishy. You need to trust us. There are adults there who are helping... The thing is, Clara, nowadays, kids feel peer pressure, you know? - "Smoke a joint or..." - That's not going to happen, David. She's very smart. It won't happen. Give me one reason to tell her, "I want you to go back." The future, David. Her future. I have a question, David. If not, what about Mayomi? We let her miss a year? - That's what matters. - Yes, David. - Let's think about it. - What will it be? We can't pull her out of school. We just can't. Mayomi can finish school and go to college. I mean, she is very capable. Listen, let me discuss this with my wife. This isn't a yes, but let us talk about it. - Thank you. - Right? - Right. - Great. Okay, thanks. - No, please. - Thank you. Time to get up. Good morning. Come on, sleepyhead. It's getting late. I don't wanna go. What do you mean? You can take a nap later. - It's not up for discussion. - I don't wanna go! I don't care. Let's go. Stop. Put your shoes on. - I won't! - Put them on in the car. You can put them on in the car. I don't care. No! Put that shoe on, or I'll put it on you. Want me to do it? Huh? Stop it, Sol! Hey, this is unbelievable! Do I really have to drag you out? - Put your shoes on. - I'm not putting them on! Sol, you're taking that test, even if you take it barefoot. Is that clear? Leave me alone. Sorry, love. Forgive me. Forgive me. I got nervous. Forgive me. No. There's no reason to be nervous. You're prepared. You'll do great. - Good morning. - Hi, how are you? - Hi. Sol Garmendia. - Let me see. Here it is. - Excuse us, thanks. - You're welcome. Here you are, sweetie. Okay. Relax, go on. Sol. - Review it before you submit. - Don't be annoying. Yes, right. Dad, I've sent you messages. I haven't heard from you. I'm worried. Are you all right? Please call me. Hello, your ID. I'm a teacher. And I'm a police officer. Yes, that's very funny. - Relax. - Come on, you know me. - Don't take it so seriously, Professor. - Okay. Subject? Literature. I'm the substitute. There you go. Okay. Today, I won't torture you by reading or writing anything. We're gonna talk a bit. Is that okay with you? Yes. What do you know about the kids who aren't coming? Karen, do you know anything about Dilan? Walter can't step foot this side of town. He's a snitch. He's not. All he did was tell the truth. Walter is never coming back. He went to the capital with his mom. He has a relative there. He's never coming back. Did he tell you that? That he's never coming back, that... Word gets around. That's all. Okay. And what about Kevin? Romina? No, Professor. The last time I saw him, we were here. Mayomi's back. - Mayomi's back, yes. - Welcome. - Thanks. - We missed you. Yes, we're very happy. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning, sir. Can I ask you to wait outside? We're talking. I'll let you know when class starts. Continue, I don't mind. But we're not teaching any content. We're just talking. I'll let you know. Fine, but I have to observe. If you're watching, we can't have the privacy to continue talking. Well, it's my job. But it's complicating mine. You're kicking me out? I'm asking you to wait outside a bit. You're kicking me out. He is. He's gonna go tell them that we kicked him out. Snitch. Okay. Well done, sir. - Good one, Professor. - Thanks. Well, where were we? You know how hard it is to get them to participate when a class loses heart. They're teenagers. They're expressing what's going on. We're doing good things. Reading poems, writing stories. Suddenly, they stick that puppet in class, and I can't. He obviously hinders them. I can't teach like that. But he's doing his job, Lucio. And I'm doing mine, but his job interferes with mine, so... And not with mine? Jeez, you're arrogant! Listen to yourself. Do you think I like being at this school with kids selling drugs, parents who want my head, and a DA who won't stop calling? And the Ministry of Education with people in each classroom. But I come every day. Every day I face it. I'm here. Do you know why I do it? For one reason only. Because I think it's worth it. Can we have a quick word? - Right now? - It'll only take a second. I'll be right back. I'd want to apologize for what happened. It was wrong. Anything else? No, that's it. I apologize. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. - Goodbye. - See you tomorrow. Did Amalia scold you? Well, sort of. Sort of? Do you need a ride? - Okay. - My car's back here. But I'm within walking distance. I live just across the bridge. Oh. I'll treat you to lunch. Come. - What are you looking at, Aguirre? - Nothing. I'm just thinking. And what are you thinking? Nothing. Tell me. I won't bite. I didn't think you'd last a single day at school. I thought that too. Is it much further? - Ten more floors. - What? I'm kidding. Come on. Just one more. Are you tired? A little bit. Bye, guys. See you. See you. Hi, Susi. What brings you here, Professor? I was in the neighborhood and needed a drink. Where's Dilan? God help him. I need a quick word with him. No idea. I don't know where he is. - You don't know where he is? - No. It'll only be a minute. I can't tell you something I don't know. A great, big hug to all the island neighbors... Thanks, Su. I'll get you the money tomorrow. What are you doing, Cacho? You good? RESTROOMS Dilan. Dilan. - Don't move! On the ground! - Wait! What are you doing? - What are you doing here? - I'm looking for you. How did you find me? I thought you'd be here. What are you doing with that? How are you? Bad. If it weren't for Susi... Why don't you go back to school? I can't. The Dog's men want to kill me. - Can't the mayor's men keep you safe? - I need your help, Professor. - Do me a favor. - What? - I need you to talk to the Chilean. - About what? - He has people outside. - Have you spoken with him? He won't listen to me. He says I fucked up. You did fuck up. Look at the mess you made. Look at you. - Talk to him, please. - Why would he listen to me? - He's your dad, sir. - So what, Dilan? You don't know the Chilean. You're persistent, Professor. Can he be trusted? Yes. How did you know he was involved? He's my student. Right. - Do you have anyone outside of town? - No, screw that stupid kid. Dilan needs to learn to be smart. He's all grown up. He's 16 years old. At 16, we are men. Have some water. Thanks. Hi, Mr. Roberto. - Hi, dear. - How are you? Fine, thank you. We can go in now. Thank you. - Let's go. - I don't want to. Come on, Dad. I don't want to. Come. We all have bad days. Yes, dear. It's okay. - Did you have a good night's rest? - Yes, thanks for asking. LITERATURE IS OF NO USE TO US So? It's a mutiny. There's no way. Hi, beautiful. Shall we go? I don't wanna go. Come on, love. What's wrong? My stomach hurts bad. Could it be that someone has crapped themselves? Not from laughing. There's a lethal gas leak! Hey, stop! Stop it! Okay, fine. Listen, if we leave now, we can still attend. I'll talk to the teachers. No problem. I don't want to keep trying to get into that school, Dad. Stop. But, sweetie, look. What's the problem? You're doing great. You're almost in. - But... - What? The building is horrible. Plus, the people have nothing to do with me. Sol, you're overreacting. We think you're quite capable. - It's a pity you won't even try. - I tried! - Well... - I studied to death, and I don't like it. Maybe you're just afraid to fail. Maybe that happens to you, Dad. Please, Sol, you're 11. - Twelve. - Okay, you're twelve! Come on, please! I'm old enough to know what I like and don't like, right? Okay, fine. Let's calm down a bit. You can still take the test. You can justify your absence with a doctor's note. I said I don't wanna go! - Stop! Leave me alone! - Okay. - I'll ask Mercedes for a note. - I don't want to! Cut it out. It's over. Esnaola Academy is ideal for her. It has music theory. Plus, Cami and Rocío will be studying there. I think... Sol wants to be with her friends. It's normal. Admission is easy. It's just a musical instrument test. Mari, do whatever you want. I give up. Be careful. It's hot. You're just as stubborn as she is. And how have you been? Good. And... are you seeing anyone? Yes. I am seeing someone. Are you seeing someone? - Who is it? - It's me, Professor. Dilan. What are you doing here? What's up? Surprise! - Hey, have you eaten? - But... Hi, there. But what are you doing here? You shouldn't be here. How do you feel? I feel fine. Besides, you're right. We can't leave this kid alone to fend for himself. It would be nice if you took a shower. Can he? Yes, of course. Come. Go on. Here. There's shampoo and soap there. The hot tap is that one. Okay, then. But what's with you, Dad? Didn't you hear what the doctor said? You must stay in bed today. I'm all right. I called my friend Medina who's in Uruguay. She has a soup kitchen there. She'll take Dilan in while things cool off here. Will he go to school there? If he doesn't, I'll kill him. Lucio... you've got to take care of this. I'm too old. Glory and praise! Unparalleled honor For the great one among great ones Father of the classroom Immortal Sarmiento Glory and praise! Unparalleled honor For the great one among great ones Father of the classroom Immortal Sarmiento I'll leave you this in case you're cold later on. Professor, have you ever written a book? What do you mean "a book"? Yes, a book. With stories, tales, that kind of stuff. Oh, I wrote a novel a while ago. Only one? Yes. Okay, go to sleep. Excuse me, room 37? Upstairs, first floor. But it's not visiting hours yet. You'll have to wait a bit. You can't go up. As I was telling you... Where are you going, sir? Wait here. Where are you going? I told you to stay here. - You can't... - Sir! Sir, stay there. - Please... - Hey! - Sir, you can't go in. - Stay right there! Sir! Please... - Stop! - Sir! Sir, you can't be here! - Sir, open the door! - Open the door! Step outside, please. We're asking you nicely, please. Please open up. Are you scared? No. Not now. Come back during visiting hours. You've got to come outside with me. I love you so much, Dad. And I love you. If you need anything for the community kitchen, let me know. I love to help. Even if we're on different sides, I truly respect your dad. It's a pity he never wanted to work with me. We could've done so much for the neighborhood. Who are you? Professor, don't you wash your hands? No? How weird. We should always clean ourselves up after peeing. Hey, I want you to tell the mayor one thing. I don't know the mayor. Sons are supposed to know what their fathers do. Especially when their dad is gone. Are you negotiating with me? We're only talking. I want Dilan to come back to the neighborhood safely. So you want me to look the other way. What about discipline? Dilan is a kid who doesn't consider the consequences. No. No, there's a code in the neighborhood. "Don't mess with the school." The school is neutral ground. - Who got the drugs in there? - Ask your pal, the mayor. - He's not my friend. I don't know him. - Put yourself in my place. Put yourself in mine. Dilan is my student. Mister Mister Pirulero Each of us plays his instrument Whoever doesn't Must give up a piece of clothing Here? I think it's around the corner. Yes, you should turn there. - Pull over. - Here? - Yes. - Are you sure it's here? Yes, they know me. - Stay in the car. - No, I'll go with you. - No. - No, Clara. You're so stubborn. - Good morning. - Hi. What's up? - Hi, Brian. - Hello. - Do you know where I can find Roxana? - Who's this guy? He's a teacher at the school. Relax, he's with me. We're helping out her son. He's our student. - Who, Dilan? - Dilan. - What's he up to? - Just hanging. He'd better not show his face here. - Can you go get her, please? - I'll go get her. - Hello. - Hi. - How's it going? - Good. Good morning. Hi, Roxana! Hi, Roxana. I'm Lucio, Dilan's literature professor. Can we talk for a minute? Okay, let's talk. May I come in a second? Fine, come in. Come. Excuse me. "...authorizes her underage son, Dilan Ernesto Sarabia, national ID card number 46,567,787, to travel alone to any country in the world by any means of transportation, being required to return to his home upon his return." Sign here. Thank you. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon to you. Thank you. Great. Thanks, Roxana. Did you pack a bag? Take good care of your documents. Don't get them wet. Roxana, I'll keep you posted as soon as possible. It should be a safe trip. Thank you so much. Hello? Hi, how are you? Is he all right? But how? All right, thanks. - Are you okay, Professor? - Yes, I'm fine. - Are you okay? - Do you need some water? - No, I'm fine. - Bring us a glass of water. - Do you wanna get up? - No, I'm fine. - Do you want to sit for a while? - No, I'm okay. Thanks. Thanks, I just need a minute. I just got a bit dizzy. Upon arriving, we hand the coffin to the cemetery staff. Although the pain of losing a loved one fills our hearts with sorrow, let us revive the flame of faith within us. So the hope Christ has kindled within us may now lead our prayers. To commend our dear Roberto, the Chilean, to the hands of our Lord. Almighty Father, Roberto is in your hands. Good morning, neighbors. Today, we are here to inaugurate our dear Chilean's community kitchen. I want to thank him before anyone else. Chilean, wherever you may be, thank you for caring. Thank you... NO ONE SAVES HIMSELF ON HIS OWN Yes, sir, ...for always caring for those who needed it most. 'Cause the Chilean started this ten years ago, feeding the neighborhood kids. First, at El Cielito Orphanage, then at La Amistad, the bakery... - What's up? - Hi, bro. What are you up to? Just hanging out at the inauguration. It's coming along nicely. How's the stew? It's good, but it's a bit salty. - Salty? - Yes. It's good. It's got good stuff. - Why don't we try it? - Huh? What's that, dude? - Some juice. - What do you mean "some juice"? - Stop it. - Hey, what's that juice? Move away. Hey, pal, you're crazy. I'm watching your back, pal. - There are kids here. - What kids? I'm watching your back. Can't you see? It'll just make them puke. It's a message from the Dog. Are you the Dog's lackey? - I'm no one's lackey. - Then why do this? - You know what this is? Your backpack. - It's not my backpack, pal. I could be gone if I wanted. Dude, what's this madness? You know what this is? You're screwed. - I'm doing this to redeem you. - I'm doing things right. What are you doing right? I'm leaving so I won't be a problem. You're screwing the professor. This is crazy. - What's up, Professor? - Hi. I'm good. Everything okay? Hi, Blanquita. How are you? - Fine. You? - Are you eating with us? No, they're expecting me. I've got to go. Bye. Don't fuck this up, dude. - We're ready. - Okay. - In five minutes, Lucio... - Bye, Professor. Bye, Kevin. - What was he doing here? - Beats me. - Did you tell him? - I didn't tell him. - Are you sure? - Yes. As soon as this is over, we're leaving. Be ready. - We're serving in two minutes. - Okay. Dilan. Help me with that pot, please. Let's start taking stuff. We continue working together, but solidarity is lacking. Put personal and political interests aside. No, don't eat! No one eat it! It's poisoned! Tell them not to eat it! Don't eat. Nobody eat. The food is bad. No one eat anything. Dilan. Go, Professor! No! Watch out. Stay low. Thanks for everything. I swear I won't let you down. Go on. Be good. Good morning, honey. Wake up. My painting's the wrong way. What do you mean? This way. Wait, I'll help you. - Upright, like this? - Yes. Then I got it wrong. What is it? It's a candle. There's the flame. Of course. I got it all wrong. - Morning. - Hi, girls! - Hi! - Hello, good morning. - Good morning, Professor. - Good morning! Good morning. - How are you? - Okay. - All good. - Good. All good? Chill. It's Friday, at last. Okay, I'm glad. What is this? - A human body. - A human body, good. Mayomi, can you tell me where the heart is? Uh... yes. - This is it. - Well done. And the brain? It's here. It's in there, yes. The kidneys? These two. Very good. The soul? I don't know where the soul is. Okay, thanks. Ever since the ancient Greeks, all civilizations have claimed the soul exists. Plato considered the soul the most important of all human dimensions. But it turns out it's not provable by science. So it's not included in the visual aid. What do you think? When someone dies, for instance, what's left? The soul. The soul? When we say, "It hurts my soul," what do we mean? That it hurts in places you can't even see. - Absolutely. - That feeling is beyond pain. You can't even describe it. Yes. It's like saying, "It hurts me to pieces." - Yes. - Or saying, "I love you with my soul." "I love you with my soul." There's something about our souls we just can't put our finger on. - That's the sense... - The underlying meaning. - What? - It's underlying. - Underlying, yes. - Unexplainable. Unexplainable. - But what do you say? Does the soul exist? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. Is it in an organ, hidden somewhere? Of course not, Professor. You can't see or touch the soul. That's why it's not in the drawing. Of course. But what is it for? Does it have a function? Do we digest with our soul or breathe with our soul? Can anyone tell me if our soul has a function? It has no function. Well, at least it woke up Richar. - Welcome, Richar. - Thanks. You've all passed this subject. I wish you a wonderful vacation, and I'll see you here next year. Congratulations. Bravo, Professor! - Professor! - Bravo, Professor! That's enough! Professor! Okay, now. That's enough! Great. Okay, now. Okay, thank you very much, but this class isn't over. You want to run out of here. No. No, we'll do one more exercise. A goodbye exercise. You've passed the subject. This exercise is just for us, okay? I'll ask you to choose one part of the body and a feeling. With it, write whatever you feel like writing. Let's go. All right. Okay. Can you lend me a pen? I don't have one. Thank you. - Here you are. - Thanks.
