Ahhhhhhh!!!!!! Why is It not responding!? I don't know! But it's not! Something's corrupted It's data matrix. Help!!!!! Help!!!!! My god!!! Dr. finley. Stay back, i'll get Him, i'll get him!!!! Get to the truck...now!! But major... I said now! Gordon, it's no use, Fallback, Fallback!!! In the vehicle Doctor, now. I doubt it'll Stop with finley. C'mon, we gotta move. Go! go! go!!! go! go! go!!! Look! Son of a bitch. Major, It's coming fast!!! How fast can it go? I don't know. Then i guess the better Question is: How fast can we go? Come on major!!!! Gun's no good! Try a grenade! Yes, sir! Son of a bitch!! It's still coming!! Hold on. Come on major!!! Get the girl Get out now!! But sir!!! Go now! Yes, sir!! C'mon!!! We gotta get outta here Before that thing Comes back!! Let's go!! Let's go!! So what do we do now? Hell, lady, You're asking me? That's your Machine out there. Something must Have gone wrong. This is not part of the Programming sequence. Could'a fooled me. Can't you Just shut it down? It's overriding The command. Somehow it's issuing Itself a new one. What the hell Does that mean? It thinks it's on a real Search and destroy mission. It won't stop Till it finds us. You mean, it won't stop Until it kills us. Any ideas you have To stopping this little Rampage would be Greatly appreciated. I can't believe This happened. It's just not possible. Naw, building Giant mechanical War machines armed with Every weapon known to science What could Possibly go wrong? Your sarcasm is real Amusing right now. Sorry. I get a little testy When i'm being shot at. Look, our only Concern is getting Out of here alive. You're telling me. Lady, that little robot Of yours anticipated Every evasive move we Made out there. That little robot, as you call It, is the most advanced Artificially intelligent Machine ever created. I'm getting real Tired of hearing What this thing can do. Why don't you start telling Me what it can't do. Not much. Great. Alright, So if we can't Get away from it, How do we stop it? Don't happen to have an A bomb on you by any chance? Left it in my Other pants. When i go out there, You take a run for it. But... Just do it. Doc go!!!!! Derek, get hold of honolulu And tell them we need To get above or around This storm pronto. Right, sir. Honolulu, this Is one niner seven, one niner seven, Come in please. Not feeling well? No, i'm not feeling very Well, at all. Boy, i sure could use A drink right now. Sorry, marion. This is A government charter Not even peanuts. Let me Check here... How can you be so Calm in this storm? Here ya go. Scotch or bourbon. Just what i needed. just relax. It's pretty hard To bring one of these down Due to Just bad weather, No matter How fierce the winds. I know, i know. I was just thinking How ironic it would be To come this far in the project Only to see it go down The drain, so to speak. Will you please chill. Here have Another one, on me. Look, marion, Our work is safely Stored in the hold And when we get to sydney And add the final programming, we can bury that Incident in the desert and reveal our Creation to the world. We'll be front page news. Let's just hope it's For the right reasons. To the project. Salud. It's too bad your daughter Couldn't be here, She worked so hard On the design. She'll be along as soon As she finishes The conference with The joint chiefs. Knowing them, that Could take weeks. Let's hope not For her sake. Well, when you next Talk to her, Thank her for the booze. Major, permission granted To go to 42,000 feet. Unfortunately, captain, That's still a bit short Of our problem. I've never seen storm Clouds go this high before. It's a first For me too, sir. What? I'm not sure. We're ascending, But the storm's still with us. You said you Were an expert. I thought there was Nothing to worry about. Should i Start worrying? Not yet, but keep your Seat belt fastened. Where are you going? Talk to the captain. Be right back. Not too long now. This aircraft's not designed To go much higher, doctor. If i do as you say, We could stall out And that's when The fat lady sings. Then major, i suggest we Try and circumvent it. Sir, that could take us Hundreds of miles off course, And at the rate We're burning up fuel In this headwind, We wouldn't make it to fiji Let alone australia. So, we can't go back, Above or around. I guess we're Going through. That's right, doc. I suggest you return to your Seat and tell the others It's going to be A little more than bumpy From here on out. Point taken, major. Please advise me If there's any change. You'll be the first To know, sir. So what are we carrying Down there anyway, major? Even if i did know, I couldn't tell ya. It's "top secret." Great. What did they say? Everything is fine. Hold down the fort. Feel better. Okay. Take a deep breath. What's that? Milt. My god, they've Been activated. Stay here, i'll get The neutralizer. Watch out! John, watch out!!! Nooooo!!!!!! What the hell's Going on back there? I'll check it out. Come in. I'll get back to you. Let's have it, major. Still no word, Sir, nothing. What about Satellite recon? Any photos? Negative, sir. That storm was massive, It covered everything In a radius The size of texas. And the transponder? That's the odd Thing, sir. According to the latest From intel, It stopped transmitting At 23:08 just minutes before the Plane dropped off radar. That's impossible, major. The black box Is fail safe. The pilot couldn't turn It off even if he wanted to. Nevertheless, General, it's off. We've got a carrier Sailing at full speed Toward the area where we Last had them pinpointed. good. I've contacted foster's Daughter, susan; She's already on a transport Headed towards honolulu. Storm's abated somewhat. We'll be able to fly her Out to the carrier As soon as she Touches down. Thank you, major. Yes, sir. Excuse me, general, I know this was your Personal project And dr. foster was A close friend of yours-- We can't presume Anything here, major. For all we know, That aircraft could Have gone down On any one of a thousand Atolls or small islands In the area. And with such an important Cargo on board, We've got to find out just what Happened to that aircraft And its passengers before Anyone else does. understand? Absolutely, sir, you're Right, we'll find them. Let's go!! Hurry it up! let's go!! What do think the Final count is, roarke? You said my name in Front of a witness. I told you not To do that. Look, i won't Say anything. I appreciate that. Whoa, what the hell Was that for? Relax, shane, The room is soundproof. Just keep packing it up. What is Taking so long? What is that?!! Roarke's work. You jerk, that is not A part of the plan!!! He opened his mouth, It's his foul up. Now, let's go! Viti levu appears to be Caught in the leading edge of the storm.... in other news, sources are Reporting a homicide aboard the sea Cruiser, oceanis. details are sketchy, but Witnesses report some shots have been fired and A steward has been killed. as of yet, police have Released no information, though robbery may Have been a motive. I knew this Was gonna suck. Ready for a little Sight-seeing, jack. Not really. Hell, you weren't thinking Of leaving without us, were you? I was thinking about it. I didn't sign up To fly in this soup With a bunch Of killers. well, who else do you Think would hire you To fly in this crap? Now fly the damn chopper. Here, maybe this'll Ease your conscience. And you don't have time To count it either. Where are we going? "Up" is all you Need to know, pal. Alright, well, then Fasten your seat belts, This could get rough. Can you fly in this? What? I said can you Fly in this? No. Wonderful. Okay, buddy, there's A private landing Strip on monolo. We'll land there. We'll never make monolo. I'm paying for Self-confidence, jack. So get us there In once piece. One piece of what? Just fly the damn Chopper, jack. General, i was on My way to see you, We've just received A faint gps transmission From a point 350 miles West of fiji. The black box? No, sir, The frequency's too weak. Intel says it's coming From a small island In the archipelago group. Check it out. Yes, sir. And doctor foster's Already on a flight To the conroy. She should get there Just before dawn. Good. I hope she knows What she's doing. So do i. Not going To make it. This wind's blowing Us off course. Look, there's an Island down there. Must be uncharted. Can you land? No, but i can crash real Good, i guarantee it. Great. Anyone see a clearing Down there? I don't see nothin'. Alright everyone, Brace yourselves. We're gonna hit hard. Here we go. Everyone in one piece? Yeah. Well, what are We waiting for? Let's get The hell outta here. Where you gonna go, pal? Just sit tight. Chill out, shane. What, you got reservations Someplace or what? At least the rain let up. Yeah, looks real cozy. Hey, where are you Going, jack? Shane, there's A first aid kit Behind my seat. Get it and your Ass out here now. It's alright, It's okay, it's okay. Must leave. They'll kill us all. Kill us all. What do you mean Kill us? Who kill us? Turn it off, Turn it off! Unstoppable... I can't turn it off! Here's the kit. Forget it. Save it for us. He's dead. Well, what did he say? What happened to him? He was Out of his mind. Who knows what Happened to him. Well i do know this. Come morning, we give This bird the once over And get the hell Off this island. Agreed? Yeah. Now let me get this Straight, admiral; You want us to chopper In and retrieve A couple of robots. That's correct, gentlemen. How do we Do that, sir? Put in a couple of """ batteries And ask 'em To come along nicely. If they've somehow Become activated, ' 'm afraid it won't Be that easy. Activated? Begging your pardon, sir, But what kind of robots Are we looking for here? I'm going to defer That question To dr. susan foster. She and her father Were instrumental In the development Of robitalian. Robitalian? what's that? Bio-mechanical shock Troops designed to lead The first wave of attack Into the most adverse Military situations. Hear that boys, It looks like we're About to be replaced. Figures. Machines taking Away more jobs. Not taking jobs, captain, Saving lives. If we had these prototypes During the gulf war, We would have cut casualties By as much as 85 percent. My father was on his way Down to australia To give these machines their Obedience programming When his plane went Down last night. Does that mean we have A couple of crazy machines Wandering around this island Looking to kill people? Not crazy, Very, very smart... And capable of learning From their experience. And being that they're Equipped with lasers, Infra-red cameras and a Rolling arsenal of weapons They are of course Incredibly dangerous. So why don't we go in with A bunch of heavy ordinance And just blast The hell out of 'em. First, this is not A mission to destroy... It's a mission To retrieve. Secondly, any ordinance You could carry Wouldn't even penetrate Their armour. Doctor, A fifty-millimeter round From a rocket launch Will cut through a tank. A tank maybe, But not these machines. We've created a new alloy From a titanium-cobalt matrix That is Literally impervious To anything short of A 5,000 pound bomb. So, doctor, if these Things are activated, How the hell do we Stop them? Let me show. screen on, please. here's what we're Looking for. Hey, my kid would love That for christmas. Well, it would no doubt Be his last ... Unless, of course, you Also gave him one of these. ...the beta laser rifle. But it takes a sustained Shot to cut through The outer shell and short Out the interior matrix. Then what happens? Then we get these things Back to the lab and make sure This never Happens again. Alright, gentlemen, This is it. Gear it up, Chopper leaves In 15 minutes. Double check weapons. Good luck. Thank you, sir. Did he have any i.d.? I checked his wallet. Some kind of doctor. What's a doctor Doing way out In the middle of nowhere? Making a house call? more importantly, Was he alone? And what was he Talking about Turning them off'? Shut up. Let's get outta here, This place gives Me the creeps. I'll go check on jack. When do we fly Out of here, jack? We don't. Rotor transmission Bracket is cracked. You gotta be kidding me, When you landed? Probably. You sure it won't fly? Well, if you want, i can Get it to spin a little for you. Can you fix it? Yeah, all i need's An arc-welder And about three days. You wouldn't happen to Have a spare one, do you? That's funny, jack, Just do what you can. You know there's A radio on board, We could call for help. The cops, maybe. Bad idea, jack. Alright, the chopper's Out of commission. Great; First we get rich, Now we're gonna die. Relax, baby, We'll hike inland. See what's here. Maybe we'll find somebody. Yeah, like maybe The same person Who ripped apart That dead guy. Dead guy or not, he got On this island somehow... Maybe that's our way off? Jack, c'mon We're moving out. If it's all The same to you, I'd like to stay behind and try to rig this tranny bracket. I can't let you near That radio, jack. You're coming with us. You're coming with us. What about The money? give it to me. Damn. Stop this thing!!! help!!! Well, There goes our ride. Our ride? For chrissakes, roarke, Is that all that You can think about? Shane just Got ripped apart. And we're Probably next. Relax, I'll get us out Of here. And just how are you gonna Do that, smart guy? You can't buy Or bully your way Out of this one this time, Can you? I'll figure it out!! Yeah, and how many People are going to die before that happens!!! Shut up, you two... You hear that? Look!! look!!! hey!! hey!! We're here. Would you relax!! We don't know who they Are or what they want. I don't care Who they are, They're a way Off this rock. Who knows how many of Those things are roaming Around this island. I say we move out. You up for it, baby? I'm up for anything That gets me Away from you. Alright, Alright, Let's move out. How about a spare Pistol for me? You'll get it when I think you need it. Sir, i've got admiral Harrison on the line for you. Thank you, captain. I'll take it Over here. So, doc, why send The helicopter back? Just a precaution, Mr. kirby. Who knows, kirb, maybe Mr. robot's learning How to fly a chopper. Yeah, got To learn how To get its fat ass into The cockpit, though. alright everybody, Let's move out. Cage, you locate That gps blip yet? Yeah, it's faint, about A half-mile that away. I don't remember Seeing any wreckage When we flew Over that area. Yeah, it's weird. Kirby, how's that gun? Just fine, major. Ready to fire. Ladies, gentlemen, Let's move. Geeze, anybody bring Any bug repellent? Got an insect Problem, kirb, I haven't Noticed any. They're eatin' me Alive for chrissakes. Kirb, take it as A compliment, One million flies Can't be wrong. Funny man, saunders. A regular riot. Hey, shhh! Major, what The hell is that? Looks like an old Pilot safety tower Left over from World war ii. Yeah, this whole area Was a hot bed Of activity back then. You think there's an Airstrip on this island, major? Maybe at one time, But after sixty Years of neglect, I doubt you could Land a crop duster... Let alone a 747. Major, We got a change In direction, This way, Just north west. C'mon everybody, Let's move out. You alright? Yeah, i'm fine. Only that heavenly Paradise you promised me Turned into A living hell. I'm sorry, it's not Like i planned this. You're sorry? What for exactly? For getting us here, For killing that Guy for no good reason, Or just being a complete And utter jerk!! Will you lay off? With pleasure. So, mr. pilot man, where Do you think we are now? Well, that chopper we're Following is u.s. military. My guess is This island's some Top secret compound. Well that would be just Our luck, wouldn't it? Good going, jack. Great place to land. Hey, pal, you're still Breathing aren't you! Well, shane isn't. Hold it. Keep it down. You hear that? I think it's coming From over there. Come on, come on. You think They are after us? I doubt it. They don't call in The army when you Rob a cruise ship. Then what are they Doing then? They're in scout Formation, I can tell you that much. You think those machines Belong to them? Maybe, Or maybe they're Lookin' for 'em. Either way, they Have a chopper. I say we go down there And introduce ourselves. Maybe bum a ride. Not so fast, jack. I say we find that Chopper ourselves And you can fly Us out of here. Are you nuts? You think the army's gonna Leave a chopper like that Laying around without Posting a guard. Yeah, you let me Worry about that? Look, you so much as Shoot a garter snake and you can fly that thing Outta here by yourself. Big talk, pal, especially Coming from an accessory To grand theft. That's right, big talk, And i'm going down To talk to those Guys right now. No, you're not! No, roarke. Go ahead, shoot me. In the back If you'd like. You'll never get Off this island. I'm with him. You look like you could Use a break, doc. I'll be okay, sergeant, We gotta keep moving. You really must Want those machines Of yours pretty bad. That's correct. There's a great potential For disaster here. How's that possible? This island's deserted. That won't stop them From trying to get off, If they've been Activated. Alright, You win, jacko. I thought you'd see It my way, jungle boy. Roarke, what About the money? Just be cool and let Me do the talking. This ought to be good. My god! Would you look At that! Dad!! Doc, come on! You said yourself This could be a very Volatile situation, So let's calm down and take This one step at a time. I'm sorry, major, I...a...just.. No need to explain, I'm just do this Right, okay? Kirby, Get that gun ready. Yes, sir. Alright, everybody. Move slow. Doctor, Stay behind us. Just in case. But, major... Please. Let's go. Major, are you getting The same vibe About this as i am? I think so. This plane didn't Crash here. No. No fire trail. No broken trees. No sign of impact. This plane was dragged Here and hidden. I was kind of hoping this Was gonna be a cake walk. Hold it. Doc, i believe your Mechanical warriors Are up and Running already. This hull Shouldn't be here. And begging the major's Pardon, sir, Neither should we. Stow it, soldier. I don't understand. It's obvious to me that This plane Didn't come down here. Something dragged it Here deliberately. My god!! Dad. Dad!! Ricks, stay here. Dad! Easy, doc, easy. Cage, take Her back outside. No, i've got To find my father. Kirby, go upstairs And check out the cockpit. Yes, sir. Anything, doc? Anything? No. My father's not here. Neither is dr. trent. They could still Be alive somewhere. No, you can't Go out there alone. If they survived Somehow, we'll find him, I promise you. Okay. My god, marion. Doc, you don't Have to see This stuff right now, Come on. I can't go. There's too much At stake here. Major, i think You were right. I think those robots Were activated during Flight somehow. I think they managed To bring down this jet And landed it as well. That's impossible. No, it's not. I helped create Those things. You see these wires, they've been Stripped clean, Almost surgically. Why the hell would They do that? Hey, maybe they needed Some spare parts. Yeah, but what for? God only knows, But i can assure You of this, They are trying To build something. Major, Two dead in The cockpit, Blood everywhere...and.. And what..? Well, it's kind of odd, All the wires and Equipment's been gutted. Nothing's left But the seats. Major, we got company. Kirby, get His weapon! Yes, sir! check the others!! Who the hell Are you people? What are you Doing here? We're on a film scout. A film scout. With guns? Hey, we were told there Were wild boar On this island. Why take chances. How the hell'd You get here? By chopper. You have a helicopter. Where is it? Lady, i wish i knew. About two hours ago it got Carried off by a couple Of things till now Existed only in my nightmares. So you've seen them. Where? About an hour's Walk that way. No, i'm not going Back there To show you the way, So don't even ask. Did you see Anything else? Any possible survivors? Yeah, we did. Some guy...just after We ditched in the storm. Where is he? He was hurt pretty bad, He died last night. We buried him This morning. Did he tell you Anything, a name, Anything at all? No, but we found A wallet with i.d. though, A dr. trent. Major, if dr. trent Somehow managed To survive that crash, My father could still Be alive somewhere. As i said, we'll do our Best to find him, But it's a big island and those Machines aren't going to make Searching any easier. If they have A helicopter, We've got to find it and Destroy it as soon as possible. Why is that? Because if those robots Have enough time, They could customize that Aircraft with parts From the jet and could Be off this island In short order. You don't think they could Really do that, do you? One of those things coming Down in a populated area Could kill thousands, Tens of Thousands of people. Get down!!! Come on back! Are you okay? Yeah. Saunders!! Kirby look out!! Come on!! Come on!! How is he? Can't tell. Definitely going In shock. We gotta get him Outta here now! What about The laser gun? We don't have that get out Of jail free card anymore. Let's go. get him up! Where is it? Why didn't it Come after us? I don't know. Any ideas, doc? It seemed more Preoccupied By whatever was in the Plane than it was with us. What would it Want in the plane? Sir. You said you had to ditch Your helicopter last night. What was wrong With it? A broken rotor, why? That's why it didn't Continue the attack. It wasn't coming After us. It was trying to replace That broken rotor. We just happened To get in the way. You mean... It's building a way Off this island... Any word from The team, admiral? It's only been four hours Since their last transmission. Well, i need some sort of Update to give the president. I wouldn't advise it. you could jeopardize The mission. How so? Well before she left, Dr. foster told us To minimize radio contact. I don't understand. Sir, if these robots Were to be activated, They could easily detect Our frequencies And triangulate the team's Exact position. I see. Well, admiral, may i remind You that if we've not heard From them by 0700 tomorrow Your time, You know the orders. I'm well aware. Keep me posted. He's fading into a coma. I can't do very Much for him here. So let's take Him back home. With what? We were dropped off. The huey's back At the carrier. That's just great, This just gets better And better all the time. Then may i suggest You radio for help. You can suggest it But the radio's with ricks, and they're both gone. Without that satellite Link up we're cut off. And the chopper Coming back when? They're not! If they don't hear Back from us That the robots Been neutralized, They're going To assume the worst. And what exactly Is 'the worst?' If my superiors don't Hear back from me By 0700 tomorrow, They're gonna nuke this Little garden spot Into eternity. That's just Great, that's wonderful. So when do we Start swimming then? So what you're telling us Is that we need my chopper As much as those God damn machines. Absolutely right, Mr. hansen. Well, then i suggest we Go get that chopper back. And fight Those machines?! That's crazy! No, i'm staying put! You do whatever You want, sweetheart; I hear radiation gives You a nice even tan. That's just great, That's wonderful, So we have two choices We fry or get torn apart by Those overgrown can openers. I suggest we go back To where you guys landed. And we begin To search there. What about your Man, saunders? Who's gonna carry him? No one. He's dead. Okay, we'll bury Him here and move out. Well, this is it. Home, sweet, home. How do you know that? The grave over there We were telling you about. They could be Anywhere by now. I hate to bring up The obvious, But what do we do If we do find them? Without the laser rifles There is no way to stop them. There might be. I know it's a long shot, But there's a Small photo-synthetic pad On the upper surface That commutes ultra-violet rays Into energy. It's about two inches In diameter Covered by A small red grating. If someone could get close Enough to get a shot Into that pad, It would paralyze Their motor-sensory system And blow the core. Where exactly Is this thing? Just above their Visual ports. So what you're saying is Right between the eyes. For all intents And purposes, yes. Well, if we're do it, Let's do it, 'cause It's gonna rain. Yeah, looks like we're In for another big one. To save some time, I suggest we break Up into groups of two And meet back Here in an hour. Sounds fine to me. If you find the chopper, Stay low, stay quiet, And get back here. I don't want anybody to Be a hero, understand? Cage, go with hansen. Doc, you're with me. and you two... Watch out for The wild boar. excuse me, general, We just received a transmission From the conroy. Admiral harrison reports a Tropical storm, category 2 And getting stronger, headed straight For that island. As if they didn't Have enough problems. Did they make their 12 hour report? Still no contact, sir. They could be staying Silent to avoid detection But it's hard to say. Notify me immediately of Any change in status. Yes, sir. Hey, fly boy. Yeah. Just exactly who are You people anyway? You heard the story. Yeah, right, Film scout, Hell of a per diem. Where did you get that? When your buddy, roarke Went to take a leak, I took the liberty of doing a security check on his luggage. Must be over a million Bucks in there. More like two. Are you the military Advisor on this movie. It's from a robbery. I gathered that. Nice haul. I was just hired To fly the helicopter. You must come cheap, You are Ex-military, right? Not many civilians could run and grab saunders like that. Yeah, i used to fly Gun ships in the gulf war, Somalia, some other stuff. Okay, it's an old story, Good soldier goes bad, Let me guess, You punched your C.o., got drummed out, Then took off For the islands. Close. Very close. Then you started a little Charter business, Times get tough, You go broke, And some crooks offered you A hand out, you take it. How am i doing? What are you? A god damn psychic? That's what They tell me. Well, you're not, 'Cause you don't Know it all. You know, doc, There's an old chinese Proverb that says The weight of pain is Lessened when shared by two. Major, i'm surprised. A military man like yourself Reading the i ching. I think it was a fortune Cookie i got offered, To tell you the truth. Nevertheless, i thank you And my name is susan. Susan. I'm richard. Pleasure. Your name suits you, But your line of work Certainly doesn't. Well, when we started Working on this project, The idea was Saving lives. When was that? I guess it Was the late '60s. My dad was Stationed in viet nam. He witnessed the deaths of Hundreds of young soldiers Thrust in the most Horrific confrontations. Still happening today, Let me tell ya. Well, he had A vision. A robotic first-line Of defense, It would not only Prevent casualties But almost certainly Discourage Any kind of Aggressive attack. The perfect soldier? Technology finally Caught up with his vision And we were able to Create the first Two prototypes with Funding from the sic. Senate intelligence Committee? I take it they're not High on your list. Men in suits telling men In uniform what to do. No, i don't like that. Democracy in action. They rushed us into Production to meet some Trumped up deadline. We should have had more Time for testing, Putting in more failsafes. Now look what's happened. Yeah, your perfect Soldier's gone awol. Run, baby run!!! Show time. Hey boss! Do you know how to Use one of these? Roger that! Stay here. Don't move. Roarke!! watch out!! Can't get a shot. Need something heavy!! Hey, the bazooka. What the hell was That all about? Maybe he went To get umbrella. C'mon, let's Check on roarke. Stay with me, honey. Stay with me. It's okay, baby. You're gonna make it. You gotta help him. He's hurt bad. Move over, Just a little bit. Well, do something!! It's too late, Nothing we can do. Yes, you can, Listen to me, honey, Can you hear me? Can you hear me? No!! Come here. Come here. Can you hear me, honey? Can you hear me, baby? No, no, no. No, no, no. Rough luck. With all that money, He could probably Afford health care. Stow it, cage. Major! I thought i Told you to stay put. I did, until one of the Robots walked right by. I know that it saw me, but it kept Right on going. which tells me there is something more important than killing us. Did you see Which way it went? Not exactly, I know it went down Into a little valley About a half mile From where i was standing. Can you show us? Not a problem. Good, that's probably where They've took the chopper. It'll be dark soon, Let's get moving. Cage, hansen, Help the girl up. We'll come back For him later. Yes, sir. We got to move, We got to go. Go below deck, Fasten those choppers down, The storms Going to get worse. No, general, they missed Their second scheduled contact. We haven't Heard word one. Nor has our sister ship. Then i suggest you Scramble an f-18 And take that Place out right now. Wait a minute, general, this weather could be running havoc with Their communications. They have At least ten hours. These are good men In a tight situation. Let's at least give Them the benefit. Under ordinary Circumstances, I'd be inclined To agree with you, But the situation Here is perilous. If those machines Become sentient Before their Restrictive programming, There's no telling The damage they could do If they make it Off that island. General, i understand the Gravity of the situation, however the president Gave us until 0700 tomorrow To finish the job. I want you To honor that order And honor those men Who are risking their Lives in the field To complete this mission. Very well, admiral, We'll adhere to The original time schedule; But if we haven't heard Anything by 0700 your time, I want that Island pulverized. Yes, sir. It all looks so Different in the dark.

How are those Oversize beer cans Gonna get in it And fly it outta here? He's got a point, If their gonna Fit in that cockpits... What are they doing To it? What's this now? What happened? Did you think They heard us? I don't think so. They're getting Mighty friendly. In a way they are. They're sharing Energy information. God, i didn't think This was possible. This is truly amazing. Cage, you think You can get a shot? Damn patches are so small, I need them to turn this way. Well, don't fire unless you Know you got it for sure. yes, major. What's it doing now?

What happened? Did we get them both? Quiet. So where's big daddy? Maybe he got lucky And ran off. Not a chance. It's probably Waiting for us To make a move On that chopper. Yeah, you're right, Why go looking When you've got The perfect bait. I have to admit that Copter looks pretty good To me right now. I hope i can still fly it after They've been messing with it. God knows what they could Have done to the controls. Major, what Are we gonna do? Hansen, you were pretty good With that rifle back there. You think you could Do it again? Yeah, no problem. Good, 'cause cage and i Are gonna go down there Try to draw This thing out. See if we can Get it facing you If we can, Your deal is to hit that patch And take it out. you get that, soldier. Yes, sir. Good. Where's the doc? Just over there. I don't think she's Doing too good. Excuse me, gentlemen, I'll be right back. Susan, i'm sorry. But i had no choice. I know. This is something dad Always half-joked about. What's that? That the servant one day Would become the master, And the master, Eventually, the slave. Cage and i are going Back down there. You stay here with jack, You'll be in good hands. Okay. You ready To move out? Yes, sir. Good luck. Okay, so what now? My guess, when we Go out there, That thing's gonna step Out and say hello. That's a good guess. So what are we Going to do? You still got that Flare gun on you? Yeah. Let's shed some Light on the subject. Here she comes. C'mon you bastard, turn. What's the matter? Can't get a clean shot. It's not taking the bait. Cage, get Outta there!!!! Ahhhhhh!!! Tunney, get the hell Out, it's no use. Doc, go for That cave we found. Move! Sorry, major, I couldn't get the shot. Forget about it It's not your fault. I sent the doc Back to the cave. Let's move out. so doc, Yeah. You think this thing Will come after us? Yesterday, i would have Thought it was impossible, But i believe the robot's Reasoning matrix May have evolved way Beyond our expectations So what you're saying here Is that this thing might be After a little revenge. You took out its companion, You ruined its plan To get off the island, yeah. The bigger question is, What the hell do we do? It's already 0400. If we don't get our Collective asses Off this rock In three hours, It doesn't matter if It finds us or not. Well, if it's Out hunting us, It can't be guarding The chopper. We don't know That for sure. There's only one Way to find out. Wait, wait, wait! You guys saw what Happened yesterday. Even if you do Manage to engage it, We don't have the fire Power to defeat it. Wait a minute. We got all The power we need. What are you thinking? The lightning. What are you saying? The thing's made Of metal, right? A highly resilient cobalt Alloy, but, yeah, it's metal. Well, lets turn it into One big lightning rod. Yeah, let's let Mother nature fry it. What do you say, doc? It's just crazy Enough to work. What's your plan? Remember that old pilot tower We saw on the way in here? Yeah. It's the highest Place on the island. Let's try luring It up there. It's worth a try. One good bolt of Lightning could take it Out for good. What the hell Are we waiting for? It's 0500 on that island General and still no word From tunney or his team. Still bad conditions? Heavy storm action, sir. It's not about to Let up either. God help them. General, Do you think should we Move up the strike? We probably should, But i made a commitment To those people And i'm going To stand by it. Yes, sir. Just notify me when The bomb is scrambled. I'll call direct From intel. Ready? Got my running shoes on. Let's do it. C'mon, you bastard!!!! Go! Go for the patch. I'm trying. It ain't easy. Forget it, let's go. That thing knows what We're trying to do!! Let's go!!
