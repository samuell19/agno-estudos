I heard you saved the village from the bandits for free? You gotta be joking! I didn't do it for free. In my country, it's called "repaying your debts." You son of a bitch! I'll cut off both of your legs! That's enough. Get out of here. Ah... Always making such a mess. This is why mercenaries... There was no need to kill him. This is your fault. Master, I'll have another drink. Get rid of the body for me. Yes...! Thank you, Mr. Garcia. Earlier, you said it was my fault. What did you mean? You're too soft. If you had finished him off, that man wouldn't have been able to draw his gun. Then I wouldn't have had to kill him. In such a small town, if a mercenary fires a gun... It's everyone's responsibility. Even my group gets hate from the locals. Are you also in the same business? You're... Japanese, right? I'm Shinya Kogami. I like Japanese people. They're serious and they work hard. Kogami, where are you headed after this? North, to the Tibet-Himalaya United Kingdom. I've heard that place is in rough shape. Oh... What a coincidence. I've got the perfect car for you. Is this a recruitment offer? Give me a break. Don't you need a job? When you work for an organization, you're forced to do things you don't want to do... I'm done with that life. Not doing things you don't want to do...? That's a rough road. I would be glad if you joined my team. But I'm lending you the car because that fight was entertaining. In that case... I owe you one. dare ni mo miserarenai mono The thoughts that I can't let anyone know atama no naka afurete Are flooding my head BEYOND LOVE AND HATE IS ____ machigai sae mo nai sekai e In a world void of even mistakes mayoikonderu I find myself lost Plastic Tac Tic mou dare mo okashiku narenai yo Nobody can even go crazy anyomore kisama mo plastic beautiful world You're also in this plastic beautiful world utsukushisugi sekai ni In a world that's too beautiful For some reason, I can't see the light boku wa nazeka hikari ga mienakute haretsu shite yuku kokoro ga eternal reflection My rupturing heart is an eternal reflection secret remains for you Fake plastic world Don't reveal these false colors and futures misekake no iro to mirai wo abakanai de Fake plastic world keep it secret motion Are you awake, princess? Where are we? It's been a while since we entered the Tibet-Himalaya United Kingdom. We're heading towards its capital city, Lezim Chuzom. But I'm not too fond of it. In this country, the government's military strength has declined. Now the battle between the armed guerrillas and the different ethnic groups is serious... I wouldn't go there if it weren't for the boss's orders. It's really scary! Tshering. Yeah? You talk a lot. Should I stop? No... What you say is interesting, Tshering. I'll tell you the most interesting story then! It was a rainy day. A man without an umbrella was dancing on the street. It was such an amazing dance that a crowd gathered to watch. I just happened to be there... Hey, wait a minute... Huh? What is it? This is an interesting story! I heard a gunshot! A bus of fleeing refugees is being attacked! Nice shot, Kogami, sir! No, no, I didn't do anything. I stopped the bleeding, but you need a hospital. Thank you. I'll take the bus back to the capital. Are you sure? You have a job to get back to, Tshering. Say hello to Garcia for me. Huh, you really are weird. But that's why the boss likes you. Well then... See you! Don't you dare die! Please, keep it. I didn't do it hoping for a reward. I did it because I wanted to. Excuse me... What is it, young lady? Could... Could you... Please become my sensei! Once you've finished eating, don't come near me again. I refuse! You're a very strong person. A perfect choice to be my sensei! Don't decide that on your own! My family was killed in front of me by armed guerrillas. In order for me to get revenge... Please teach me how to fight! How to fight... It means killing people. Will you kill them? I will! I'll do my best! You'll do your best... You're Japanese, right? In Japan, at times like these, don't they say, "Have the courage to be righteous"? You're wrong. Huh? It's "To see what is right and to not do it is the worst cowardice". Well, either way, I will fight to get revenge for my parents. By then, whether you have or haven't taught me how to fight... I ask you... Which one would give me the highest chance of survival? You... You're good at negotiating. Then! I'll teach you only as a way for you to protect yourself. That's my condition. I don't think revenge... is worth risking your life for. About the value of revenge... I'll think about it after I get stronger, Sensei! Don't call me Sensei. You can just call me "Kogami." So... What's your name? Tenzing! First, we need to find an inn. There's a place were we can stay. Really? Anyway, you've grown so much, Tenzing. And you've gotten older, Uncle Kinrei. Even if I look old, I'm still only 36. So you're going to be Tenzing's sensei, Kogami? Yeah. I heard what the other refugees said. There was a Japanese man who saved them from armed guerrillas. You're a decent guy. That's rare for a mercenary. Thank you. We all want to be decent most of the time. Actually, Tenzing's father was Japanese. He was sent to this country for a developmental program and married my sister. He, his sister, and Tenzing's siblings were killed... when that girl was just 6 years old. About her revenge... Don't worry. I'm just teaching her how to defend herself. I see... Thank you. Well? Isn't it nice? That house... Now that the inhabitants are gone, the Tibet-Himalaya United Kingdom manages it. You can use it as you like for a while. Thank you. By the way... Is there a shop around here that sells tobacco? Sorry, the Tibet-Himalaya United Kingdom has always been a non-smoking country. Would you like a bite of this instead? Thank you... If you want a teacher, wouldn't Kinrei be the better choice? That's why you were on that bus, right? The Tibet-Himalaya United Kingdom is in trouble right now. Uncle Kinrei was actually an office worker, but he was forced to go to the front lines. I'm sorry, that's a shame... Is that... a handgun? Yeah... I have reasons to hold onto this. Hey... Hmm? Shooting people... What does it feel like? It depends on your conscience. But once you shoot... You can never return to who you were before you killed someone. The sins you carry will become heavier with time. You don't need to worry. I'm not so sure myself. By the way... Did you need something? This book... "Beyond Love and Hate"? This was... one of my father's relics. I just happened to have this with me. But I can't read Japanese very well. Of course I'll teach you. Thank you! Good grief. I... What is it about children...? Eeny... meeny... miny... moe. Father! Everyone! Can't sleep? I had a bad dream... A bad dream? Kogami, you're a little like my father... ...Is that so? My father used to say, "I didn't do it hoping for a reward." Even if you lose... Never regret doing what you wanted to do. He was a good father. Yeah... "In the spring of the third year after they left Edo..." "Two processions of Daimyo..." "from the northern prefectures passed by at the same time..." "for their alternate attendance in Edo." "The roads were crowded with people." Huh? What is "alternate attendance"? Daimyos from all across... To and from the capital... It's... a parade of samurai. Yeah, it sounds exciting. I knew it... Japanese books are difficult. No, remember, Tenzing... "Beyond Love and Hate" is a short story. With that attitude, I wonder if you can finish reading it in ten days? In this story... the main character, Ichikuro... is on the run after killing his master. And he became a bandit and killed more people. Well, he's morally depraved. What ends up happening to Ichikuro? You'll have to read it yourself. Hmm? What are you doing here? Nice to meet you, Shinya Kogami. A pursuer? Will you kill me? Or arrest me? I'm Frederica Hanashiro, Assistant Officer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Japan. I came here to survey the abandoned people in Japan. Hanashiro-san from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs... I heard that the fugitive officer, Shinya Kogami, was here. I thought I'd take a look at the face of a celebrity. Arrests and dispositions are not my job. By any chance, are you... An abandoned Japanese? Yes, that's right. A survey of Japan's abandoned people? There was a time when the Japanese government sent engineers to the Tibet-Himalaya United Kingdom. However, after the Sibyl System was put into operation, support operations suddenly ended. And then the people who had come to Japan to assist... were unable to return home. You're saying... Yes, the support operations members... were selected by the Sibyl System. In other words, Sibyl deported those it deemed unfit. My father was abandoned by his homeland... So... What is your job? There may be some people with good Hues among the survivors of Japan's abandoned people. I came to get a statistical sample. What if their Hues are good? It hasn't been decided, but a transportation operation might begin. No, thanks. I won't go to Japan. This is the country my family loved. Kogami! Hmm? Who is this beautiful woman!? Oh, I'm so happy. She's a Japanese official. Don't worry. What's going on? It's not good! Supply units are being attacked at the station to the south! What can I do about it? Please give me a hand. Without those supply units... Even people in Lezim Chuzom will starve! If there is no killing, then I'll take care of it. That's fine. My 4WD is faster than a junker like his. All right, let's go. Me too! Idiot! That's not a good idea! Captain! Whose armed forces are they? I have no idea! Just hold them off until reinforcements arrive! Help me! You fool, what the hell are you doing!? Kogami! Hey, Kogami! Are you okay? Kogami... Who are they? The government hired a professional dispute negotiator to resolve the conflict. They were originally United Nations peacekeepers. Now, they're a mercenary group led by Garcia. We are the Peace Monitoring Group. We want to avoid unnecessary deaths. Drop your weapons now and surrender! Don't let your guard down! Stay alert! Roger that. Hey, Kogami. Is this your gun? Yeah, it is. So we meet again. Aren't you a little too bloody? It's just a scratch. Thanks, though. No, this is my job. Anyway, let's celebrate this reunion. Yeah. Kogami! You! Why are you here!? Don't be stupid! What are you doing with this child? I'm not a child! Here you go. I saved these for you. By the way, I heard from Tshering. He said you helped a refugee bus on your way to the capital for no reward. Kogami, you really are a strange person. In that type of situation, that was the only way to act. Oh, so that's it. All I can say is that you don't have to die for nothing. For you and I, this is a hard world to live in. Good! It suits you, Kogami! More importantly, let's start training! Yes! Good morning. Those clothes look good on you... Are you going to live here? Eh? ...Well, that might be nice. More importantly... Are you really going to stay at this house? There's an extra room. And this house is under government control. I don't need your permission. That is true... Tenzing! You're absolutely... I can't believe you haven't completed your refugee application and registration yet... I forgot. I'll tell the officers. While I'm there, I can also extend Kogami's temporary residence time. Thank you. Wait for me, Kogami! That's... a sky burial. When children die, we purify them and return them to the sky. In the past, there was never a sky burial so close. But now it's dangerous to leave the capital and there are many refugees who have evacuated from the countryside... Is that so... You are... surrounded by evil spirits. On the west side of this kingdom... It seems they tear apart the hip bone when they bury the dead. If the dead have any attachments to this world, they will become an evil spirit called Rolong. To avoid that, you have to break the bones. Evil spirits are part of the past. There are no evil spirits coming from the future. You wished for revenge. A choice that keeps evil spirits "alive." And now that you've gotten revenge, you can't stay in Japan anymore. Because you killed me, you now live being constantly swung around... Under the control of a dead man... In other words, you're obsessed with evil spirits. Not everything involving the past is bad. Guess you're right, Shinya Kogami. Kogami, Uncle seems to need a little more time to finish the process. Really? Is something wrong? You seem a bit down. No, it's nothing. At the request of the Tibet-Himalaya United Kingdom government, the Peace Monitoring Group... has started negotiations with each armed force currently in conflict. In fact, since the arrival of the Peace Monitoring Group, the number of armed conflicts in the country has been reduced to less than 1/10th what it was. A welcoming mood has already spread among the people. Begone! What is your Peace Monitoring Group?! It's just a threat, isn't it?! Kogami... Did he do something bad in Japan? He did. What was it? In a word... Revenge. Huh...? Revenge... Kogami? He lost everything. Or maybe... he gained nothing. Over the last remaining place he belonged... Kogami prioritized revenge. And his journey without a destination... began. This is a dish I learned to cook during my travels. I can't guarantee that it'll taste good. Oh, you give that warning every time. You can't tell good from bad. Noisy. Shut up and eat. "Minosuke found his sworn enemy of many years." "Like a rat in a bag, he will regret being placed in front of me." "No matter how many stonemasons protect you..." "I am determined to do what is needed to kill you." Ichikuro, who was supposed to be a villain, repents and becomes a monk. He started digging a tunnel in a steep mountain... That's right. There Ichikuro meets Minosuke, whose father Ichikuro killed. Minosuke cannot kill Ichikuro... Do you think there is any significance that this book was my father's relic? I used to be a detective. Therefore, I don't like the word "coincidence." If, by chance, you feel that it has significance... Wouldn't that be destiny? Destiny? Kogami... Did you get revenge in Japan? Yeah, that's right. I got revenge. But you hate it when I try to enter the battlefield. You won't teach me how to shoot a gun. You're not ready to shoot. You're not ready to be shot. I'm ready! Don't lie. Anyway, you'll still be in training for a while. Go to bed for today. Don't forget to brush your teeth. Uh huh. What's on your mind? "Tobacco is good..." That's not all. I've come so far. It's as though the incident in Japan was a dream. Far from it, but... In the end, aren't you going in circles? What? Where you are, you can't see the truth, the place you should be. You distance yourself from those who need you. You're just running away. After I left Japan, I moved from place to place around Asia. Do you know about SEAUn? Yeah. After that, it was the same no matter where I went. I was welcomed as a tool in a series of battles. I accepted that treatment. But after I started training Tenzing, I realized... "This child..." "I don't want her to be like me." It's been a long time since I've thought about this. That's what they say... "The flower goes back to its roots and birds return to old nests." Your intuition is right. Even if you say that... If I return to Japan, won't I be killed? The situation may change soon. Will the Ministry of Foreign Affairs change? Or... Well, never mind. Just... Don't mislead Tenzing by telling her irresponsible things. What do you mean? The survey of Japan's abandoned people... That's just an excuse for public appearances... Right? You're here for a different reason... That smells bad. Sorry. It's psychological. Male, heavy smoker... There's a high probability that you received excessive affection from your mother in your childhood. Or... Vice versa, excessive loneliness. Yeah. Are you counseling me? On what basis? Non-verbal communication... Humans communicate in other ways besides language. The moment you heard "mother," wrinkles formed between your eyebrows. When you said "loneliness," they disappeared. Perhaps... You feel guilty? Are you worried about your mother who you left in Japan? Are you reflecting on your own selfish behavior? I'm surprised. I am a former student of Professor Saiga. What happened? You forget your place... Actually... Until recently, I worked as an Assistant Inspector for the Criminal Investigation Division. What? I transferred from Foreign Affairs to the Public Safety Bureau. The Criminal Investigation Division... They were beyond excellent. There was unusual teamwork between the Inspectors and Enforcers... And I felt the amazing strength of the unique people as I passed by. That is the influence of Akane Tsunemori. I wonder if her personality... Is what attracts good detectives. Everyone's fine. I'm very relieved to hear that... Those guys... Maybe they're already trying to forget about me. Why do you think that? Is that your desire? Do you want them to forget? If everyone forgot about you, would that make it a little easier? You're intense. I get that a lot. This is a follow-up report on the explosion that occurred yesterday at midnight. The leader of the Purple Dragon Clan and eight others were killed. Further details are still unknown. The ongoing peace talks will certainly be affected. The new leader who took over command of the Purple Dragon Clan... Has shown cooperation with the Peace Monitoring Group's efforts. Uncle! You came. What? Tenzing came, too? Yes. Even if only a little, I want to support you two. I'm not going to work directly in security. Oh! Is it okay if I go get something I left behind? Yeah. Hey, Kogami. Garcia. You're seriously trying to make peace. The United Nations has been gone for a long time... We are working to inherit the philosophy of that time. Is that feasible? Even though killings are on the rise, I still believe in people. Like you, I was also merciful to the guerrillas, and I almost died. Because of my naivety... people are dead. Dead people don't come back. Only those who survive can move forward. Yeah, I understand. Right away. Time for me to go. We finally got a peace meeting. I will patiently lead the conflict to a solution. The Purple Dragon Clan boss was killed by an IED the other day. Yeah that, at least... I pray that the wind will change direction. I'll protect everyone. You can't shake hands with a clenched fist... A wise man said these words long ago. We need to put our weapons aside today, and take the first step towards peace. Let's get started. After all, railway rights are the greatest problem. No party would yield on that. Where's Garcia? Outside eating a meal. I will review the terms that were proposed so far in the negotiation. It looks like this is going to take a while. Until the peace negotiations are over, training is on hold. Sorry. But it will definitely be for the sake of this country. Yep! Hey, is there anything I can do? I'm hungry. Can you go and buy me something? I'll give you money. Yep! Kogami? I'll have the same thing as him. I understand! I'll be right back. How about that girl? Does she have talent? As a soldier? Yeah. I hope not. That's right... I don't want that girl to take revenge. I agree. It's over if someone becomes like me. Oh, that's not... I've killed people... I got used to it... I lost my sense of purpose... What am I living for...? Kogami... How much is this? It's 200 for four. Thank you. Eeny... meeny... miny... moe. What was the purpose of the last attack? It was perfect. What are you complaining about? The enemy's counterattack was much more aggressive than I imagined. We lost ten percent of our forces. We can't keep the fires going at this rate. That's why we're paying you more than you asked, aren't we? We're more than fire extinguishers; we're a business. You're not listening. We're the ones who killed the Purple Dragon Clan's boss who wouldn't listen. We're doing all the dangerous things. This isn't fair... Garcia. What do you want? I'm standing on the front stage. As a reward from the Tibet-Himalaya United Kingdom, can you ask for a territory? Build our castle there. I've done my job. I've killed everyone who has seen my face. No one would recognize me.... That guy... My family... Father... Why did you leave this book for me? Once you shoot... You can never return to who you were before you killed someone. Your strength and your commanding ability are high. However, Jean... You're not suitable as a partner in my eyes. What? Listen! That's real cheeky... You've got a short temper, Jean. This is... I think there's a big meeting. I hope it will end the war... A girl? Yeah, about this tall... Hmm... Sorry, but I haven't seen her. Kinrei! Tenzing, what happened!? Ko... gami... I found my family's killer. What!? Garcia... made his guys... do it... Eh!? Hey! What happened!? Get the car! Ah... I understand. Wait here! The target is a Japanese man named Shinya Kogami. Turns out he assassinated the boss of the Purple Dragon Clan. It'd be best if you could catch him alive, but he can be killed if necessary. Find him right away! Shouldn't we have taken her to a hospital right away? Until we understand the situation, it's best not to move her. We'll leave as soon as we can. Garcia is... the "fire" and "fire extinguisher"... That's what they called themselves. Don't strain yourself. Garcia... also killed the Purple Dragon Clan boss. I... thought I'd... shoot him... I couldn't... That's enough. No more talking, Tenzing! Please... don't stop negotiations... because of me... Garcia is a bad guy, but... the peace talks... are real. Even if the talk is fake... if he brings peace... Ending the war... is surely... more than... worth it... right? Sensei? That's right, it's as you say. Huh? Wait! Wait! Tshering? What the hell is going on? Are you the terrorist who killed the Purple Dragon Clan boss? Do you think I am? Huh? If I thought you were, would I have come alone? I understand. They're locking down the south and east exits. Over here! Come with me. The nearby hospital is probably being watched. We can go to the southern town, but I'm worried about time... Guide me. I'll fly. Kogami, what about you? You'd stand out with me. I'll stay here and watch the enemy. Understood. Kogami... Leave the rest to me. Garcia is a typical "match-pump"... His group creates a problem themselves, then they provide the solution. All so that they can squeeze as much out of their clients as possible. That's... You recognize it, don't you? Me too. I didn't know anything. That's right. He separated the good guys from the bad... So that no one would pry into the secret. It was nicely done. Her surgery went well, but her condition remains serious. Yeah, I understand. Kinrei, stay with Tenzing. Thank you. So, what do we do? Tenzing almost died because of me. In other words? I'll take responsibility. But, what about your promise to Tenzing? I'll keep it. I won't touch him until the peace negotiations are finished. By the way, when will you start the survey of Japan's abandoned people? Right now...? I have no intention of blaming you for that. Just... Do you have any resources I could use? I have no reason to help. ...Is what I'd like to say, but I want to make a deal. Shinya Kogami... When this case is over, I want you to help me with some of my work. Understood. Let's do this. Hey! Don't make a promise without hearing the details. It's not an empty promise. If you can help end that man, it doesn't matter what the deal is. Okay, it's a deal then. Tomorrow, the Peace Monitoring Group leaves the capital. While they're on the move, we attack as planned. Understood. The people in lower positions don't know anything. Can you do this without killing them? Rest assured. That's the plan. Therefore, the chance of success is low. That's why I prepared a trump card. A trump card? Yeah. For the people of this country... Dying is only part of the cycle of death and rebirth. In Christianity, death is atonement for sin. Shinya Kogami... Perhaps you think you're the evil spirit. Not even realizing that you're already dead. Wandering this world, falling even deeper into the hell of the battlefield. No, I won't be like that. Makishima... That Japanese man... How's the search going for Shinya Kogami? Still no sightings in our search net. Maybe he's already left the country... If so, that's good. They'll arrive soon. Don't let them shake you off. Roger that! Target confirmed. Prepare for impact! What!? Enemy attack! A drone attack caused the ammunition depot to explode! The rear cars with the troops have been separated! Launch the drone and fight back! Understood! Don't rush to the point! I know! You're so persistent. Don't die, sir... Intruder found! Kogami...! Kill him! Leave this to me! Thank you. The enemy drone interfered! The invader is coming! I can't forgive you... Garcia! You've caused a lot of trouble! It would have been better if you were just an ordinary bandit! Neither mercenaries nor bandits have the ability to do anything on their own! They just continue to steal! The limit is coming! That's a selfish excuse! Then come, Kogami. You don't understand the weight of having to feed your men... because you're on your own. Your life is that of a man who has never had to carry another person's life. Yeah, that's right. We're... We just wanted a place to belong. That's it! You fool! I've returned your knife that you left in Tenzing's body. Kogami, sir! I can help you! Hey, your little story that was interrupted before... Huh? The man dancing in the rain. Yeah... I've been waiting all this time to hear the end... It was a rainy day. A man without an umbrella was dancing on the street. It was such an amazing dance that a crowd gathered to watch. I just happened to be there and asked the dancing man, "Why are you dancing in the rain?" Then he answered... "I actually pissed myself a little while ago." "My pants were wet, so I'm dancing to cover it up!" Yes. In the end, peacebreakers were the source of the weapons. Roger that... We'll withdraw. Mr. Garcia, the leader of the Peace Monitoring Group, has been assassinated. Mr. Tshering has inherited command of the unit. The criminal has been determined to be Shinya Kogami, a Japanese mercenary. There is a reward for any callers who can provide information. Shinya Kogami also assassinated the leader of the Purple Dragon Clan... Kogami... They had to do that, otherwise the peace negotiations would have failed. Someone had to be the villain in the story... Really... He's a fool. Sensei... This is what I asked for, so it's all right. Yeah. See you, Tshering. You've changed a little. Is that so? The shape of the world does not change so easily. That's why we always have to grow. We will never be able to move forward... If we don't settle things in the past. Settling with the past, you say. I don't like the Sibyl System. I'd even say I hate the system. Oh? So you also hate the people who live under the Sibyl System? Of course not. You still have people to save, things to do... Are you really okay with this? Yeah. Let's go back to Japan.
