Yes, probably. Ours is not a grey world. Under the bright light of truth, it's a world of clear contrasts. Black and white, good and evil, right and wrong. There is always a choice. But with faith, the choice is an easy one. What our church has done here, what you have done here over the past two weeks, is clearly right, and undeniably good. Just look at Jessie's photographs. You tell me. Is it not in the smiling face of a child that we find the true wonder of God's grace? So... tomorrow, as we set off on our long journeys back home... Sure you don't wanna fly? It's not too late. I think it's time to reflect on this final thought. It's only six days. When you find yourself in the darkness of despair and you're struggling to get back into the clear light of God's truth, remember what you learned here about the simple power of compassion. When you light a lamp for someone else, you brighten your own path too. Honey, come on, let's go! - Hey, little snoop! - Shit. Roy! Sorry. Just wanted to see if you wanted to get some... shashlik and golubtsy. Golubtsy? What's that? Oh, wait. Excuse me! Excuse me? That toilet is not working. Excuse me? Hey, let me take care of this. Er... Dobriy vecher, ma'am! Er, T for toilet, toilet... Toileten? No, no. She thinks I meant tea. No, ma'am. Er, toilet. Toileten? No, no, no. I'll have a beer and the missus... - Coke. - A coke. - Thanks. - Thank you. Is it necessary to smoke while we're eating? We're not eating yet, Roy. - It affects my appetite when you... - I'll blow it this way. Just blow it in another... They search between stations so the rats cannot jump ship. - The rats? - Drug dealers. Oh! Hey, little fella. - Did he scare you, sweetie? - Not really. Best not to tangle with the police in China and Russia. Especially Russia. I know a man who was detained in Bratsk for 28 days because his name had been misspelled on the visa. They demanded 5,000 US. Of course, he refused to pay, out of principle. - What happened? - He paid. With two toes from his right foot. You mean, the police...? Oui, monsieur. The police. My compliments. Bon voyage. And good luck. - He was just putting us on. - No, I'm tellin' you. That's how it is. It's like the Wild, Wild East out here! Shit! There she is. Bonsoir, mademoiselle. - Oh, God, no! How do you turn it off? - I don't know. - Ask the bitch. - Let's just make do. ♪ Think of me, babe, whenever ♪ Some sweet-talking girl comes along ♪ Singing her song ♪ Don't mess around, you gotta be strong ♪ Just stop, cos I really love you ♪ Stop, I'll be thinking of you ♪ Look in my heart and let love keep us together - You're drunk. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. - So what? ♪ You belong to me now ♪ Ain't gonna set you free now - ♪ There's no... - Hey, no, no, no! - I want you. - Oh, Roy. Roy, Roy. - Wait. Wait. - What? I don't know where they are. Are they in your wallet? I just thought maybe this once we could leave it to fate. Yeah. Not this again. Not now. Come on! Oh, for Pete's sake. OK. I love you, Jess. ¿Qué coño llevas aquí? Ahí está. That's yours. - Let me do mine. - Shh. Carlos, she's sleeping. OK. Esto es lo que me apetecia a mi. Esto es lo que queria yo. - Hello. - Hello. Get it while it's hot! Oh! Sorry. Oh, great! You're up, honey. Er, this is Carlos and, er... Oh, boy! - Abby. - That's right. Abby. Carlos and Abby. My wife, Jessie Nusser. Here you go. So where are we? We just crossed the border at Zabaikalsk. We're in Russia. Siberia. - First time for you? - Mm-hm. Oh! Here we go! They're changing the bogies. Grab the camera. This is great! - Roy enjoys his trains, no? - Just a little. Yeah. Oh. We'll let you get dressed. ...they even changed the gauge. What's interesting, honey, the Chinese didn't want the Russians to invade, so they made the tracks narrower. The Russian gauge is 5.6 feet, which is three inches wider than the Chinese. So these Chinese wheels gotta go. Where did they come from? I don't know. Some machine-tool factory near Moscow, I suppose... No, them. Our new cabin mates. Oh. He said they were teaching in Japan. English and maybe some Spanish. Oh, honey, get a shot of that! They're raising the train. Get a shot. You know what? I suppose they keep the bogies over there. I wonder how they get 'em onto that track and then under, but you know what? It's just amazing. Hey, our new friends! Sit. - Thanks. - Come on over. I'm gonna get some vodka. So, how was customs? Oh, jeez. You know, they really gave us a bit of a hard time, Carlos. What, you two? No way! Yeah, they were suspicious of our passports. - What? May I see them, please? - Sure. OK. This is why, Roy. Look. They're new. Brand new. A new passport is easy to forge. There are fewer stamps and visas to copy. Hold on. Those are the real McCoy. We just got those. Hold on. Let me show you mine. This is the real McCoy. - Oh. - See? Well used. They are not accustomed to new passports. What's Canada like? I always... Let me tell you the secret to getting through customs and across borders. Pasar desapercibidos. Don't stand out. You think it's obvious that we're Americans? Well, she definitely looks American. - So you've done this trip before? - Sí. Train is cheaper than plane. I don't like the cold. But my yogurcito, aquí... Huh? - The colder the better, hm? Sí, no? - Sí. If she loves cold, she'd love Iowa, cos it gets cold there. Here they are! - Hey, you think maybe it's early to... - Early? You know, Roy, it's late! It's 3 am. Trains run on Moscow time. We have much catching up to do! - Not for me. - No? - No. - But it will melt the ice inside you. - Can I please bum one of those? - "Melt the ice"! - Cheers! - Na zdrowie! - Hey, he's got it! - Na zdrowie! - Where are you from? - Nowhere really. Seattle. So, you've been teaching English in Japan? - How was it? - It's alright. Hm. I prefer Southeast Asia. I guess you've been travelling a long time. Er, about two years. You ever miss home? Nah. I never really had much of a home to miss. Never thought about getting off the road? You know, plant a root? So, er, you were helping kids in China? Yes, yeah. Roy's church... Our church has a... has a programme. It's like a sister city thing. - That's nice. - It was nice. It was a lot of work, but it felt good, y'know. I'd never done anything like that before. Like what? You know... Lending a helping hand. Helping someone who's down. Roy's real good like that. He's... He's good with people. Da, da, da! He seems like he would be. Oh, God. Look at this! Look. A tiger attack him in Khabarovsk. There are tigers in Russia? A lot of Siberian tigers. He hunts them. Tony the Tiger attack me! Hey, look at this! - A deer attack me! - A deer? Yes, John Deere power mower! Gulag? - What did he do? - Wrote poetry. Gulags still exist? No. But once, in Siberia, were many gulag. If you want truth about America, you take a book. You want truth about Russia, take shovel. They are all buried here. Scientists, priests, poets. There is no good under the snow of Siberia. Oil! There is oil! - To Oil! - To Oil! - And you? A little poison for you? - I don't drink. - Are you sure? - She's sure, Carlos. That poison will kill you faster. Thank you, Carlos! I try and I try, but that is the one bad habit of hers that I haven't been able to change. Yet! Kill off all my demons, Roy, and my angels might die too. Roy! ¡Cacho cabrón! ¡Cabrón! ¡Cabrón! - Oh, I'm sorry. I'll... - No, it's fine. Stay. - You're hot. - Yeah. It's hot in here. If we can just crack this window open. I've tried already. We are shut in tight. We'll just have to sweat it out. But it is good for resaca, no? What's "resaca"? - Hangover. - Oh! Well, I wouldn't know. Did you get anything good? - Yeah. I think so. - Do you mind if I... take a look? Wow! Vaya fotos más guapas. They're beautiful. Look at this one. You must sell them for much money. - Don't you? - No, I don't sell them. - No? Why not? - It's more just a hobby for now. For now? I don't know. Might do a book someday. I don't know. I want to show you something. I don't want those drunk Polacks looking in and getting ideas. Son unos pesados, polacos. Wow! No, not this one. This one. This is my favourite. You see, all the others are smiling and this one is so sad. I love these things. See? It's alderwood. These are one of a kind, not for tourists. They pay much money for these in Amsterdam. Is that legal, reselling them? Yeah. I mean, a little baksheesh to customs now and then, but it's legal. They are matryoshkas. It means "mother". - See the belly? - Hm. They celebrate fertility. Now, there she is. The little bambina. Look at it. Isn't that cute? Carlos? - Er, hold on! - Carlos? I had to lock it. Fucking Polacks. They keep coming in like they're invited. - Hi, Abby. - Hi. ¿Lo ves? What did I tell you? Next stop, Irkutsk! C'mon! Let's go! - They have everything. - Crazy. Where's the baby? - The pirozhki is really good. - They are? Should we get one? It's my treat. Here they are! Take a look at these, Carlos. Wow! Coal burners! I'm in heaven! You like them? - Who said that? - What? "Kill all my demons and my angels might die too"? Tennessee Williams, I think. - I like it. - Yeah? - Saw you have a journal. You a writer? - No. - No? - No. It's more like a travel diary. Uh-huh. Well, I bet you got some good stories. I sure did. Yeah. None of them I'm too proud of. I left home when I was 16. Maybe for the same reasons as you. Spun my wheels until my late 20s. Never spent more than a week in one place. No, wait, I'm wrong. There was jail in Memphis for nine days. And detox. That was two weeks, I think. This was all pre-Roy, of course. - So, how did you meet? - How did we meet? Well, Roy likes to say we met by accident. I was drunk and I swerved into his truck head-on going 40 miles an hour. - Beautiful, huh? - I saw many in Rajasthan. - Where's...? - India. Oh! Wow! You've been pretty much everywhere, huh? Life is a journey, Roy, not a destination. I like that. That sounds like something Jess would say. - Really? - Yeah. She's still a bit... What's the word? Restless. Yeah. OK. So this trip, the Trans-Siberian, it was her idea? No, that was me. You see, we never travel anywhere. So, when the church gave us this chance, l thought it would be a perfect opportunity to impress her with a big adventure, y'know, make her happy. She seems happy to me. Well, tell you the truth, Carlos, we've been having problems lately. Marital problems. Ah. I am sorry to hear it. I think she thinks I just play it a bit safe sometimes. Before I met Jess, I thought I was the wild one. I'm not sure she expected to end up with a hardware store owner. Much less one with a train set in his basement, but... I love her, so... Oh! Carlos! You got to check out this boiler! What a beauty! Ain't she gorgeous? He came to the hospital every day. There was no one else. I'd pretty much pissed off everyone else in my life by then. He said something to me one day I'll never forget. He said, "No matter what your aim..." No, wait. "No matter what your dream in life, no matter what your goal, keep your eye upon the doughnut and not upon the hole." - What's that supposed to mean? - I don't know, but it's so Roy! No, I guess it's like, you know, if you focus on the positive, you can do amazing things in your life. Before we met, I was a bit too focused on the negative. I'm not saying settling down solves everything. Roy and I are so different in many ways. He wants kids, for instance, a family, you know. I mean, I do too. Of course, I do too. It's just it's... - It's just such a huge thing to... - Plant a root? Yeah. I want a family. But I'd get it right, you know. There's this place in Vancouver on a lake. This cottage. It's got this long wooden dock that you can go out and sit on. Surrounded by the mountains and... it's quiet. No one else is around. - Sounds nice. Is it a family place? - Yeah, my grandfather's. Well... He actually sold it to pay for his trips to Reno. Huh. I'm gonna buy it back. Wow. Vancouver on a lake! Sounds expensive. Yeah, I'm working on it. With Carlos? I'm sorry. That was none of my business. - We should get back on. - Yeah. - Hey, it was good talking to you, Abby. - Yeah, you too. - Here. - Thanks. Roy? You there? Excuse me. Have you seen my husband? You can't keep doing that. We have five more days before... - Roy's gone. - What? I looked up and down the train. He's not on it. - Well, sit down. - Didn't he get back on with you? - No. - Oh, shit! We looked at the old trains, and I left to get some food. - Maybe he didn't hear the bell. - What am I gonna do? He's got to be here somewhere. - He's not. - He's fine. We'll just have to ask around. This is a fucking nightmare. The station master will put him on next train. You wait at station. When's the next train? There are delays. Police are checking all trains to Novosibirsk. - Checking trains? - Da. Drugs. OK. So when's the next train? - Zavtra. - Zavtra? Tomorrow. He'll be OK. - I guess. - You can't do anything else. Jessie, we're gonna get off with you. Oh, no. Really, you don't have to do that. Please! We will die from train food! A vegetable would be nice, hm? We've been at this longer than you. It's not safe for a woman by herself. Ilyanskaya. Ilyanskaya. Five minutes. - OK? - OK, let's go. - You need some help? - No, it's OK. OK, c'mon, girls! Hotel! Very, very nice! Big rooms! Ha! Magic words. Let's go. Nyet. I am sorry. We will try tomorrow. Look, don't you understand? He'll be here tomorrow. I just want to know he's OK now. This happen many, many times with tourists. This is Russia. - Everything OK? - He doesn't know a thing. Just that the first train from Irkutsk gets in at noon. - He'll be on it. He'll be fine. - Yeah. Yeah, I know. - Hey, hey. Let's not worry about Roy. - Carlos! - Sorry? - Roy es un machote, eh? A big man. Big man can take care of himself. OK? C'mon! - No, thanks. - Not this time! - No, thank you. -Sí, sí, sí, sí. Now, I bring good news from the kitchen. They have vegetables! Bad news... It's a potato. Solo eso. One potato! But don't be sad. We'll have so many things to do as we starve to death. This town is rock'n'roll, man. Should we stay a few more days to see everything? Oh, God, please, no! Potato! Hm. Mrs Potato. Spasibo. - One of a kind, huh? - What? Your matryoshka dolls. Carlos told me they were one of a kind. The salt shaker. I'm going to bed. Good night. Did I say something? No, no. She didn't know I had the dolls. We had a little problem with customs not so long ago. So she wanted me to stop. But you didn't. Yeah, sometimes I'm careless. And I need the money, OK? Cheap imitation, by the way. Don't take this the wrong way, but isn't she a bit young to be tramping around the world with you? Should I find someone older to tramp around with? No, I just mean, she's a good girl. So I am what? ¿El lobo feroz? The big bad wolf? You're irresponsible. Hipócrita! - You understand? - No. Roy told me about your bad-girl past. Why this trip, Jessie, hm? I understand Roy. He likes choo-choo trains. But you? Why are you here? What are you looking for? A little bit of excitement, like you had before, when you were the chica mala? When there was nothing to hold you down? No compromise? When life was just sensaciones? Man, I sure wish I'd met you back in the day. Sí? Yeah. Nothing cleared the head back then better than a good, pointless fuck. I'm tired. I'm turning in. Buenas noches. - Guess what. - What? Our shower is broken. Can I use yours? I brought my own towel. - Spasibo. - De nada. - Are you going sightseeing? - No. I'm waiting for a call from the front desk. About my husband. Is Abby sleeping? Hello? - Mrs Nusser? - Yes. I have found a hotel in Irkutsk with an American guest. They'll call back soon. Oh, great! That's great. Thank you so much. I'll be right down, OK? They found Roy. Key's on the table, OK? - Mrs Nusser, American is not Mr Nusser. - Not Roy? But you said they found him. Maybe he is not in Irkutsk. No! No, he is in Irkutsk. That's the whole point. Mrs Nusser, we called many hotels. We must wait. We must wait and see. - Have they found him? - Not yet. Shame. The first train is at noon? Yeah. Yeah, he's on it. OK. Great. Then we have four hours. Bueno, ¿qué? What should we see? The bauxite mine? Or the toothpick factory? Neither. You like to photograph beautiful things? I'll show you something guapísimo! C'mon. Get a coat. Mrs Nusser? It's for you. - Roy? - Hi, sweetie! Oh, Roy. What an adventure, huh? Wow. - I was pretty worried, Roy. - I'm fine, honey. I'm fine. I had a couple of roubles so I was able to get a hotel. - But they say I won't get in till 4:30. - 4:30? That late? I'm not complaining. Gets me a few more hours to check out these coal burners. This place is a treasure-trove, sweetie. - How you doin', by the way? - Fine, Roy. Just fine. Jess, it's incredible. They got this old Soviet shunting loco here. It's got... -4:30 now? - Uh-huh. Well, then you have no choice. ¡Vémonos! He says closest airport is Krasnoyarsk. Oh, shit! Er, is there a bus that goes there? Or a car? Masheena? It would be very, very expensive. Almost 1,000. I have the money. When? Tonight. His brother can take you. How many passenger? One. Bus? Or a time machine? It's incredible. No? - What did he say? - I have no idea. But he pointed that way. C'mon! Wait! - Are you sure this is the right way? - Yes! How are we gonna know how to get back? You have been dropping breadcrumbs, right? Uh-huh. Carlos. I think we should head back. Two more minutes. How do you know? Carlos! Carlos! Wow. You see? What did I tell you? Hey, Carlos. You put that in your book. Was I right? ¿Está guapo, eh? Wow! Amazing! Thank you. - Let me take one of you. - No, I look stupid in photos. - Just one. - OK. - Thank you. - Lovely. - C'mon, can I have it back? - Beautiful. OK, I'll do it. Thank you. What are you doing? - I can't do this. - What? I'm stupid. I'm sorry, Carlos. - What? - I'm sorry. Where is the chica mala now? C'mon. No one will know. You little tease. Fucking tease. Fucking... Get the fuck off! Where are you going? C'mon! Wait! I will not hurt you! I swear! Jessie, it's OK! Where are you going? It's OK. I'm not going to hurt you. Give me a hand! Fuck! ¡Puta madre! ¡Ven aquí! Fucking tease! Fucking bitch! Stay away from me. Stay away from me. I will not hurt you. I will not hurt you. Hello! Porter. For take you baggage? They're on the bed. Hey! Oh, boy! Does that feel good. - Car two, cabin four. - I'm so sorry. You? Hey, I'm the one who screwed up. Honey? You OK? Hey, you alright? Just cold. - Where's your coat? - In my bag. You are so silly. C'mon, let's get on the train. Can you believe it's snowing? You know the guy I'm with? Carlos Ximénez? Do you know where he is? He left this morning by bus. With the American woman, Nusser. Did they say when they'd be back? They are back. She just left to the station to meet her husband's train. Spasibo, tovareesh. It means "comrade". Our new cabin mates have been teaching me some Russian. I had them phone the hotel in Moscow, and they know we're gonna be a day late. But there's still two days to, you know, see Red Square and the Kremlin and... Wow. You really didn't sleep a wink, did you? Was it that bad? - What? - Your hotel? Sweetie, I swear to you, mine was like a gulag. And... You know the stock room in the basement at the store? It was half that size. No windows. And, oh... Oh, here we go! And... Oh, this is the best part, OK? The phone rings three o'clock in the morning. It's reception asking, "Do you want a prostitute?" Apparently, it's normal here but it threw me for a loop. I mean, I... ...good at what she did. Just kidding you! Sweetie? You alright? - Sure you're OK, sweetie? - Yeah. Yeah. I am now. Oh! There he is. - Where ya been, tovareesh? - Tov-ar-eesh. - Tov-ar-eesh. - You must be Jessie. Yeah. Oh, this is Ilya Grinko. He's our new bunk mate. Hi. My colleague tells me he is too busy and cannot join me for early dinner. May I ask you to accept my invitation? I am... How it is? Famished? "Famished" is right. Yeah, we're happy to join you. Is that alright? Sweetie? - Is the dining car even open? - I am afraid my watch does not work. Mine is fine, and, oh, we're in luck! It's almost five. Almost five. Here I am trying to explain the situation to the station master and Ilya appears out of nowhere and starts translating. Your husband is lucky guy. Oh, yeah. His English is excellent. Don't you think, honey? My son encouraged me. He... He liked your country. He was going to be in diplomatic service. Well, hold on there, Ilya. Can policemen drink while on duty? We won't tell my boss, eh? - No, thanks. - Don't be shy. - You're a cop? - A detective, Jess. Da. With FSKN, like your Bureau of Narcotics. Ilya's on his way to a big conference in Moscow all the way from Vladivostok. In Soviet days, official like me would get plane ticket, first class. Now, seven days on train. - Na zdrowie. - Na zdrowie. Hold on there, Ilya. Don't tell me that you miss the USSR? The USSR was a dark, evil empire. Maybe so. But then we were a people living in the darkness. Now we are a people dying in the light. Which is better? When it was USSR, a man lived to age 65 years. Now it is 58 years. I know this fact very well. I am 58. In Russia now we say there are only two kinds people. Those who leave in private jet and those who leave in coffin. - Which are you? - I am too old to leave. I just do my job, Which is catching the bad guys, huh, Ilya? Right, Roy. Well, who are they? Who are the bad guys? Ten years ago, it was easy. Drivers bring heroin from Kabul in back of truck. We catch them. So they get smart. They add special chemical to heroin, mould it into objects. Um, souvenirs, handicrafts, small toys. And they pay people, mules, I think you call them, who can travel easily with drugs. They use students, old babushkas, people who look innocent, but are really not. Hm. These are bad guys. Hey, Jess... Abby and... Shoot! What was his name? The Spaniard? - Carlos. - Yeah. The backpackers you told me about who shared your cabin? Yes. Abby and Carlos. Do you think they could've been mules? In past year, this line has become major trafficking route. You know, Ilya, now that I think about it, this couple seemed to know an awful lot about forging passports and sneaking over borders and whatnot, this Abby and Carlos. At least, that's what they said their names were. This couple... Did they seem suspicious to you, Jessie? No. Just young. They were going where? Moscow? They never said. So you left them on the train when you got off... in Ilyanskaya? Yeah. - Are you feeling better? - Yeah. Oh, good. You're lucky you didn't have that Russian vodka. You're lucky you're not drinking, you know. So, what do you think of Ilya? I know what you're thinking. I mean, he's a persistent S-O-B but I betcha he always gets his man. - Hey, we were just talkin' about you! - Only good, I hope. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, please. Allow me. - Oh, oh, no, that's OK. - Jessie, Jessie, let me help you. Let him get it. It's OK. - It's fine. - Let go. - He's got it. - Thank you. She's a headstrong woman. You know how that goes. - Hey, how many days to Moscow, Ilya? - Three more days, Roy. - Whoo! Amazing! - You want to stay on train forever? - Guess what. - What? Our shower is broken. They found Roy! Key's on the table, OK? - Spahkoyniy nochi. - Spahkoyniy... Spahkoyniy nochi? For now that's good. Sweetie, can you hit the light? I have my eye thing on. ♪ Who's tripping down the streets of the city ♪ Smiling at everybody she meets No, not this one. This one. All the others are smiling and this one is so sad. Toilet's clogged. You gonna fix it? It was an accident. - I'm gonna grab some photos, OK? - I'll keep an eye on you. - I'll be fine. - Oh, no. I'm not making the same mistake twice. Hey! Ah, Jessie! Taking some pictures, I see. I am not photographer but may I suggest that side of platform? - That looks heavy. Please, allow me. - Oh, no. It's not. It's fine. Take my tea. Now, there is very nice picture. Bright colours, babushkas, Russian faces. Take, take, take! Take more. I believe we have time. Why do you wear it if it doesn't work? It was my son's. I gave it to him when he graduated university. He died of bone cancer. Oh, I'm... I'm very sorry. Ah. To live life is not always to walk through a meadow, eh? Still, we find ways to survive. My colleagues in Krasnoyarsk, they search the Vostok, the train you got off in Ilyanskaya. They could not find Carlos and Abby. - Maybe they got off somewhere between. - Maybe. My phone. I got it now. Thanks. Da? Jessie? This is my colleague, Kolzak Yushenkov. He is also detective. We are travelling together. Right. Jessie, would you come with us, please? My husband will wonder where I am. He knows you cannot be far. There are few places one can hide on this train, no? This Carlos and Abby, perhaps they got off train with you in Ilyanskaya. - No. - No? You are certain? In Russia we have expression. "With lies you may go ahead in the world, but you may never go back." Do you understand this, Jessie? I have spoken with police in Ilyanskaya. They have spoken with manager of hotel. This witness saw you having dinner with the Spaniard. Jess? Are you OK? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, what are these? What are they doing in your camera bag? Did you buy 'em? No? Where did they come from? Carlos. - Carlos? - Yeah. - He gave these to you? - Yeah. - Jess? - No... - He didn't. - Jess? Oh, God! It's OK, baby. It's OK. It's OK. - Heroin. - Oh, Lord! How did Carlos get the dolls into your bag? He came into my room. I let him. His shower wasn't working. He wanted to use mine. So I left the room and saw police searching the hotel. Carlos must have seen them too. I... I think he'd got scared and that must have been when he did it. What then? I went to the lobby and I waited for a call from Roy. It was there that I saw the two of them leave and go off together. Jessie. Why did you tell me they did not get off train with you? - I just got scared. - Why? I got scared for Abby. I got to know Abby. She's a good girl. OK? So when you asked me those questions, I froze. I didn't want anything to happen to her because of what Carlos did. She's not part of it. She didn't even know Carlos had the dolls. - How do you know this? - He told me. He showed me the dolls. When you were alone with him? Yes. And later, when I found the dolls in my bag... She got... She panicked, Ilya. You'd just told her about how the smugglers operate and she got scared. It could happen to anyone. Da. Fear can drive one to irrational acts. In Russia we know this very well. Our history is a history of irrational acts. So... that's it? Hm... Apart from, I'm afraid, one formality. Ah! I was right. Very beautiful! - Is it OK? - Yeah. What will you do if you find them? - First we must find them. - Carlos! Ah! This is very nice one! This is Ilyanskaya? Which church? I... I didn't get the name. Ah, this is very nice one. Like... - Hey, Carlos! - Russian symbol, no? - We can take care of that. - I am sorry for inconvenience. We will arrive in Moscow tomorrow. I will stay in Kolzak's cabin tonight. Spahkoyniy nochi. Spahkoyniy nochi. Good night. Spahkoyniy nochi. Spahkoyniy... nochi. I'm sorry. Jess, I love you. That means we should be able to tell each other everything. No secrets. You put that in your book! Guess who's not at her station for once. Of course there's no milk or sugar. Well, at least she turned off the music. Hey. We did the right thing, OK? Yeah. Yeah... I know. Shall I get sugar from the dining car? - That'd be sweet. - OK. Give me your hand! I got you! You're OK, you're OK. Ilya? What... What is going on here? What... There are some problems with your wife's story. Ilya, where are the other cars? Who the hell are you? Kolzak... Roy. Jessie. It is best to sit. Your wife was seen leaving Ilyanskaya on a bus with the Spaniard. Now, perhaps your wife can tell us, where is Carlos? Hm? Hm? Da. It seems, Roy, your wife has problems with the truth. Don't tell me about my wife. I know about my wife. Who are you? Who are you? I am Detective Ilya Grinko, Narcotic Division, and this is my colleague... Bullshit! You're not a detective! You're a liar! If you please. - Where are we going? - On a short walk. - But, Ilya, we don't have any coats. - Roy! - My glasses! - Let's go. - We're... We're Americans. - Let's go. Please sit. Remove your shoes. - What? - And socks. Ilya, we're freezing to death. OK. OK. They found her back in Ilyanskaya. She was looking for her... boyfriend. Ilya, what do you want? You have your drugs. Not my drugs. Roy! You think this is about couple kilos heroin? His boss moves 20, 50 kilos heroin every day. He expects... ...sometimes his mules to run off with delivery. He does not expect them to steal money. That he does not like. Don't! Stop! Stop! Whatever Carlos was involved in, she isn't. Please! You American women. You describe Abby how? "Good girl." No? Does good girl recruit boyfriend? Does she pretend to love him, so that he will stick knife, this knife, - so she can steal his money? - No. Does good girl do that, Jessie? Murder a man? Then deny it? No... It's not true. I am detective, Roy. I know only facts. One, Abby does not know where Carlos is. Two, she does not have the money. So, this is my theory. Find Carlos, find the money. Oh, no! We took a bus! We took a bus out of town. We got off in some village somewhere. I took some photos. And then... And then... We came back. He got off in town and I went back to the hotel. I didn't see him again. I don't know where he is! Please, I don't! I don't know where he is! I don't! I am a fair man. Kolzak less so. He wanted to tie your feet. I think there is no need. You are not criminals. You must have a lot of questions for each other, so I will give you small moment to talk. Is there anything, anything at all you can say to help us? Jessie, no matter what you say to me right now, I will still love you. You understand? No... No matter what you say. God... Oh, Roy. OK. Let's go. - Go where? - There's gotta be another way out. We have no shoes. They have guns. They'll kill us! - Don't leave me, please. - We can't just leave her! She's why we're here! It's not true. It's not true. Please don't go. Help me. - Please... - Jess! A door! No. - Please don't leave me. Please help me. - It's OK. Where's Carlos? - Where is he? - It's open! - Where's Carlos? - Jess, hurry! - Where is he? - Jess! Where is he? This way! There! I see daylight. - I gotta break it. Give me that pipe. - OK. Jessie! Here. Good enough. Chinese-made crap. We sell 'em in the store. Hey! help me! Go, go, go, go! Go. There it is! OK. OK. C'mon! C'mon. Hi! Roy! Shit! Shit, Roy! - Push him out! - What? Push him out! She's powered up. I worked a diesel simulator once. - At the rail museum in Des Moines. - Great! - The gauges were in English. - Oh, shit! Roy! Shit! Shut the doors! Shut all the doors! - Shut all the doors! - OK! OK! That's the throttle. Brakes. I just need the brakes. That's it, sweetheart! Yeah! She's stalling. Where's the fuel pump? Come on! Oh, no! - He's coming! Shit! - Jess, hold the door! No! Oh! God! Are you OK? Kolzak! Nyet! You will talk to me! You must take responsibility! He will kill Roy! OK? Where is Carlos? Where is he? Where is he? You think this American bluff, this game? He will shoot him. In the head! Unless you tell me now! Where is Carlos? - He's dead! - Where is he? I killed him! No, no. No... No, wait. Listen to me. It's... It's him. He... He was gonna kill us. He was gonna kill us. Wait. Wait. Wait. Listen. Listen. He... He was trying to... He wanted to... You got the statements? Er, Mr Nusser? Yeah. Come on in, fellas. Now, these three were mid-level ops in an Uzbeki gang, run by a fella named Javid Rukshan. He pours junk into the States via Japan. And your pal, the cop, he made sure that nobody interfered with the operation including, of course, his own guys at the MVD. He's a marked man now, on both sides. The good news is, Mrs Nusser, that your photo may make it possible for us and the Russian police to put this operation behind bars. Way to go, sweetie. Oh, yeah, sorry about the camera. Now, may I give you a word of advice? Something my mom always used to tell me. Don't you be talking to strangers. Carlos Ximénez. From Barcelona. Those are his priors. Theft. Possession. Sexual assault. Trafficking was a new bag for him. - Well, do you think you'll find him? - Hm. Someone will. Us, if he's lucky. - And her? - Abby Brunelle. 20 years old. Last known address, Seattle. Haven't been able to track down any family. Just another lost kid. Made the mistake of falling for the wrong guy. Well, like you told us in your statement. Yeah, here we go. Yeah. All nicely printed out in easy-to-read English. What's gonna happen to her? When she's fit, she'll be sent back to the States at the taxpayer's expense. You know, your signature here means that you swear it's all truthful. Just... Right here, Mr Nusser. Roy. I need to see her. Hi. I wanna tell you something, OK? - Here you are, sir. - Thank you, ma'am. - You alright? - Hm-hm. What did you say to her? Just something you once told me. In the hospital. Oh! You're kidding? The doughnut thing? Honey, I don't even know what that means. I just was trying to cheer you up, make you look on the bright side. I know. Yeah. Sure gonna be nice to be back home. Max. Max... Leave her alone. - I'm sorry. - It's OK. It's OK.
