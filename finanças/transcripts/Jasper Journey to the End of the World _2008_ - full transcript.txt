(wind blowing) Dad? Yes, Jasper? What's the world like outside? Haven't we been through that already? Oh, please Dad, please! Well, it's a very nice world. It's small and flat with edges, and there's lots of snow! What's snow, Dad? Snow is white and... very snowy. What's beyond the edges, Dad? Enough questions, Jasper. Please Dad, what's beyond the edges of the world? Nothing, that's the first thing you learn at school. Never teach an egg to talk. That's the second thing you learn. (penguins laughing) Anyway, Jasper (gasping) Jasper? Jasper? Jasper! I'm just going to have a little look myself. Watch where you're going! Hi Mom! Hello darling. Jasper? So this is the way you hatch your eggs! Fine, next time you stay home and I'll go fishing! Whoops! (cheerful music) (Jasper laughing) Higher, higher! (Jasper laughing) Again, again! Just once more. (Jasper laughing) Dad, what was that? That was a double flip-flopperoo! No Dad, I saw something. It was strange and it was far away. Beyond the edge, and-- Don't be silly, son. (singing in unison) I walk in single file. We'll never go astray. Our strength and heard, and put up front. That is the penguin way! (Jasper singing) I don't know what I've seen. It wasn't just a dream. Wow, everything is closer. (Jasper screams) Shouldn't you be at school? Oh. Jasper, you're missing the sliding lesson. (Jasper yelling) Hello in there. I'll be your brother, once you come out. Hurry up, and I can show you! Alright Jasper, that's enough. Run along now. (penguins laughing) The known universe... Small, flat, covered in snow with edges around the edge to fall off, if you're not careful. Because there's nothing else out there. Jasper, what did I just say? That there's nothing out there beyond the icebergs. And the world is flat. Emma to Captain! No activity to report, sir. Except some boring snoring. Where are pirates when you need them? Secret Agent Kakapo to Secret Agent Kakapo, on the case. The sooner this slow boat reaches port, the better. You did hide the you-know-what properly, didn't you? Yes, you mean the eggs? Shh... (INTERCOM) Attention please, attention please. Would the owner of the... (door creaking) Please remove it. Otherwise, it may be removed and quickly destroyed. Ha, hid them properly? Yes, of course, I put them in-- Just take the eggs, and throw this quivering heap of feathers overboard. Okay. He's having some kind of fit. That's how kakapos respond when they're afraid. (Kakapo screaming) Good shot, boss! What a shame kakapos can't fly. Or swim. But, wasn't that littering? We're villains, we're allowed to litter! Now, take those eggs back to the cabin immediately. What do we have here? A nosy little girl. Spotted anything interesting? I saw you drop a bottle into the ocean. Children should be seen and not heard, and preferably not seen, either! I may have a word with the Captain about you. (crashing) What was that? Maybe it's pirates, preparing to board and scupper the ship! Scupper? What a delightful nautical child. Ha, naughty you mean. Maybe you should take one of these, just in case. Stop prattling about pirates, and- What on earth is going on here? What's going on here, Captain? t's just a minor engine problem. And my daughter is... I think she's lovely! Dr. Block, allow me to introduce Madame Svetlana Bolamova, one of the finest singers of this century. Or any century! Madame, this is Dr. Block, inventor of the world-famous Block's Best Lemonade, and his assistant. Ah! We'll be on our way any moment. It would have been faster to swim. Emma. Don't worry, Dad, I saved one for you. Even though the Captain is supposed to go down with his ship. (radio beeping) I found the problem, Captain. You'd better come and see for yourself. I still think there could be pirates. Hello fish, don't be nervous. I already had breakfast. I bet you've seen some interesting things out there. Hey you, Finny! Ahoy! I said, ahoy! Hey, you there. Wait a sec, I'm coming round again. Help, it's c-c-c-c-cold. C-c-c-cold? What's that? What's c-c-cold? This is c-c-cold, I'm cold. The freezing icy water is cold! I have to get back. It's always like this, isn't it? Not where I'm from, it's not. What do you mean? I mean palm trees and sunshine. Tropical nights and balmy beaches. Ice in small quantities only. In your drink with a little umbrella. Just follow the sun, pal! Stay where you are, don't go away! I'll be right back! Wait, don't leave me alone, I need help! Come back, please! Please! Uh-oh. Please. Mom, Dad! Ah, quit it! Mom, Dad, quick! Come quickly, Mom, Dad, quick! I wanna show you! Ow! Jasper! I know mom, and I'm really sorry. But I just saw this weird bird at World's Edge. And he doesn't come from here. And I know you're always saying that there's nothing out beyond the icebergs. But if you could just come and look because I saw him and thing is... He's green! Honest. Come see. I just hope you're not making this up, Jasper. You've caused enough trouble for one day. He was here! Weird green bird, where are you? Weird green bird! Weird green bird, eh? The whole family's weird if you ask me. (penguins laughing) Jasper, haven't you learned anything at school? No. I mean yes. I mean, what was the question again? Hmph, there's only so much that school can do. I've never been so embarrassed in all my life. We've to go and help the others find their eggs. I'll help, too. No! Jasper, you just watch Junior, while we go and clear up the mess you made. Alright? But, but, I've never-- No buts. You've got to be a responsible penguin from now on. No more crazy stories, no more exploring. Do your homework, eat your seaweed, walk in single file, understood? Yes, dad. There's more to being a penguin than just standing around on eggs, son. But you'll learn in time. (sighing) Okay, those are icebergs, Junior. And those are more icebergs. And the white stuff, well that's snow, and that's it. Except for Junior over there. Off you go, all by yourself. Over the ice floes. And you can't even swim yet. Junior! Junior stop! (Junior squawking) Come back! Junior, wait! Junior! (Junior squawking) (Junior squawking) (Junior whimpering) Junior, don't run away like that! I'm in enough trouble already! (Junior squawking) Ha-ha very funny, Junior. You know there's nothing out there. Now let's go before we fall off the edge of the world. Junior, I told you, there's... You see, you see! I knew there was something out there! (cheering) Ha-ha, it's still there! It's still there! Hi! You there! Weird green bird! Hang on, Junior. I shoulda kept my big beak shut. I know, why don't we send a secret agent, Kakapo? Now look where I am. Hello? Weird green bird? Don't sneak up on a bird like that. Especially a Kakapo on secret mission to find the Kakapo eggs. If it's a secret, should you be telling me? Good point, forget I told you. Okay, anyway, I didn't mean to scare you. Scare? Ha, it'd take a lot more than that to scare me. However, I'm glad you decided to help. My claws are frozen. (Junior squawking) No, no, Junior, you stay here. I'll be right back. When I get you free, will you come back with me and show the others I wasn't making you up? Why would anybody make me up? Hey, easy there, watch the toes. (laughing) That tickles. (laughing) Whoops! You didn't hurt yourself, did you? Of course not, I did that on purpose. Lend a wing here, will ya? (grunting) One feather tickles another. Glad to have you onboard for our mission, pal. Mission, but we have to go back to my village and prove I'm not imagining you. Of course you're not imaging me. Ouch! See, if you were imagining me, that wouldn't have hurt. Now, we have to do things, official things. But you can come with me and be a hero. Imagine how proud your parents will be. But... Not that I'm trying to sell it. (radio beeping) Engine room to Captain. We're nearly ready here, sir. Dad, I know who's behind all this. It's not a pirate. It's the blocky man with the bad temper. Emma... Sometimes your imagination is just a bit too active. Unless he's the pirate. That would explain everything. Emma, whatever you might think of Dr. Block, he's not a pirate. Wow! Well, would you believe me if I told you there's a green parrot looking in the porthole right now? Nope. (Emma gasping) And now there's a penguin. Look dad, look! Wow, look, a flying penguin and an Antarctic parrot. I'm sorry if you're bored, Emma. And if you want to have make-believe friends, I guess that's alright. (radio beeping) Engine room to Captain. We're ready for orders, sir. I'm on my way. Now, Emma. You're only to interrupt me if it's something big. Like an ostrich maybe. (laughing) Very funny, Dad. But I'll find them, and then you'll see. You'll see. Sometimes I really wish we could fly. What, it's a ship. Hey, help me down here, Jasper, and I'll give you the grand tour. Here I come. Nice catch, kid. Mom and Dad have to see this. Shh, not so loud, they might hear you. Who, Mom and Dad? The sneaky-fingered, nest-robbing, feather-plucking humans, that's who. The thieves who stole the eggs. Somebody stole your eggs? Who told you? Is there a traitor in our midst? You told me, just now. Oh, in that case, okay. Look, there's a human now. Where are you going? I'm going to tell it to give you back the eggs. Are you insane? Tell a human something? (sighing) Hey wait a minute. Listen, from one bird to another, don't even go near a human, never. Well, how are you going to get your eggs back then? You mean we, how are we gonna get the eggs back. Do you know who you're dealing with? Secret agent Kakapo, of Kakapo Island. Winner of the Kakapo medal, for exceptional bravery and courage. At your beak and call. Ahhh-hoo-a-ha, hoo-a-ha-ha-ha... Agent Kakapo? (crashing) Agent Kakapo, are you okay? No... Yes. As my assistant, you'll be learning that trick. Assistant? But I have to, whoops! Ow! That's it, you're fired! I'm sorry Kakapo. Oh, in that case, (horn blaring) You're rehired. What was that? Oh, that's just a special noise the ship makes before it starts moving. Now then, as my assistant, your job will be to take care of-- Junior! (Junior whimpering) Hang on Junior! I'm coming! Don't jump, don't jump. You made a mistake with the bucket. I'm over it. Let me go, Kakapo. I have to save my brother. Is that all? He's over there. Junior! (Junior squawking) Wait, there's a human. Hmm, another one. Wait till Dad sees this. If you would stop wriggling so much, I could get you out of this. Hang on Junior. I saw you at the window. (Junior squawking) Kakapo, help! It's mine! Give it to me! Ow! Wow, a whole colony. Emma? Don't go away, I'll be right back. Hi Dad. What are you doing? Nothing, but look! Ow! Well, I want you to stop doing nothing, immediately. Is that clear? Aye aye, Captain sir! But Dad, wait. Look what I found. Oh, fiddle. Just where did they go? From now on, Lucifer will be guarding the eggs at all times. (laughing) I could listen to that evil laugh, all day. You'll be hearing it a lot more, once I have perfected my new recipe, and spread fear among the children of the world. (laughing) No, no if they get too warm, it will ruin everything. Go fetch me some ice, and hurry. Blocks, cubes, crushed, or shaved ice? Now! Herbert, it's not an all-you-can-eat contest. But it was included. And I want value for my money! We have to get off the ship. Wait. (Junior squawking) Hey! So, you're deserting me, after insisting on being part of my secret mission. I have to take Junior home, Kakapo. The longer I wait, the further away we get. I promised to look after him. Look after Junior? The guy's a natural-born secret agent. He'll be called junior-agent Junior. Ahhh-hoo-a-ha, hoo-a-ha-ha-ha... Hoo-a-ha, hoo-a-ha-ha-ha... No, he's too young. Now can you help me with this thingy, Kakapo? Kakapo? Go on, why should you care about me? Leave me in the lunch. Serve me and my eggs up to the humans. Let me depart this life, as a parrot schnitzel. I don't understand. I feel a sad song coming on. ♪ (lyrics) I'm just a Kakapo ♪ And everywhere I go ♪ Humans know the parrot I'm playing ♪ I look pretty distinct ♪ It's a shame we're near-extinct ♪ But being flightless just ain't paying ♪ There could come a day ♪ When we will pass away ♪ And then what will they say about me ♪ When the end comes I know ♪ They'll say just a Kakapo ♪ And life goes on without me ♪ Cause I'm so sad and lonely ♪ Sad and lonely, sad and lonely, sad and lonely ♪ Extinction ain't for me ♪ No it's not ♪ I don't wanna be extinct. (crying) But why do you need my help? You're a brave and fearless secret agent. I'm not. We Kakapos are the rarest, scardiest birds, in the entire world. We're so scared, we don't even dare give our children different names. So we're all called Kakapo. You are? Yes, but there won't be any more Kakapos, if I don't bring back the eggs. I'll just freeze in terror, like I always do. And they'll be no one to unfreeze me. So you really do need my help. Okay, but if I stay, you have to promise to help me get Junior back home, the minute we're... Junior? Junior! Over there. (Junior squawking) Well that's fishy. Still frozen, eh? Another one? (Junior squawking) There he goes. Let me see. Fish fingers for the waddly ones. And pineapple for the scaredy one. Oh, there they are now. He's certainly not invited. Careful. That human is real bad news. Junior, psst. Shh, don't psst so loud! Junior, come out of there right now. Jasper, don't leave me by myself. Stop that knocking and come in. I was trying out a new secret knock. Just bring the ice in here, before it melts. Hey, this is not a game, Junior. Get those eggs iced, Rolf. They mustn't hatch yet. Why not? Because my new recipe won't work without fresh Kakapo eggs. My eggs, of course. They're here! What's Lucifer doing? I know what he wants. Hey, Lucy baby, look what Rolfie got for you. A fish finger, how disgusting. Rolf, what are you doing with a fish finger? It's strange, boss. I found these fish fingers in the corridor, leading all the way to the Captain's cabin. Interesting. Ow, the fish finger bit me. (Lucifer growling) (screaming) So... (crashing) I'm Emma, by the way. And I'm Jasper. That's Junior, my brother. And that's secret agent Kakapo, our leader. Hey, hey, don't touch, don't touch! Quick, or he'll wind up in the washing machine. What's a washing machine? It makes things clean. Oh, thank goodness you're here. He doesn't look very happy. Or very clean. We have to make it stop. Washing machine, stop. No, we've got to find the right button. Maybe it's this one. Not that button, whoa, whoa! Sorry. Maybe it's this one. Or here? What about that one? (Kakapo gurgling) Sorry. Oh, dear. We haven't tried that one yet. Now he's looking clean. I'm so soft. Oh, no. Oh, Kakapo. So that's the secret mission. Maybe you can help us. Stop, you just spilled the beans to a human. We're not all bad, Mr. Kakapo. But, if you don't want my help getting back your eggs... Ha, how could you help anyway? My father is the Captain. All I have to do is tell him about that rotten egg-thief, and he'll say... That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. I should sue the company. I apologize, Dr. Block. Dad, you have to listen to me. Dr. Block is the reason the birds are here. Emma, you can't just insult our guests like that. Tell the doctor that you're sorry. I'm sorry. Well? That you're an egg thief. Emma! I'm sorry. Good, now go to your cabin and stay there. But, but, ugh, that's not fair! Kakapo? Jasper? Junior? What are you doing up there? Hiding. Well, why don't you come down, so we can figure out a plan. Do you know how long it took us to get up here? (screaming) Bad news, my dad didn't believe me. Surprise, surprise. The human didn't believe her. Don't worry, Emma. My dad didn't believe me either. And he's not even a human. She has failed in her mission. You haven't done that great yourself, so far. She has a point there. But if you want me to leave-- I didn't say that, did I say that? He didn't say that. Maybe you should make her a secret agent, too. Hmm, I don't know. Can you fly? No. Can you swim? A bit. Great, you're in. Yeah! (Junior squawking) Are you sure nobody will disturb us here? Believe me, I'm the last person any of the humans want to see, at the moment. (Emma humming) What's this? A clock, for measuring time. What's time? Don't ask. Yoo-hoo, I'm here Emma darling! Your wonderful father thought it would be good if I keep an eye on you, you naughty girl. (whispering) Head for the door. I'm not gonna be disturbed. I've brought along a few little things. There you are, darling. We'll have such fun talking about well, me mostly. It's for the best, Emma. The Diva is going to take care of you while I'm on duty. Then you won't have to make up imaginary friends anymore. But Dad, the birds weren't... Real. I just made them up. See, my influence is paying off, already. But if I stop making things up, then I don't need a babysitter either. Don't think of me as a babysitter. Think of me as a role model. It's just until we reach port, Emma. Humans, humans everywhere. And you can't trust any of them. We can trust Emma. She protected us back there. Maybe, maybe not. What if she's a double agent. Ooh, Junior, no need to kick me. Oh shoot! (screaming) (Junior squawking) There you go, Junior. Some mini ice bags, to keep you comfy. (VO Kakapo) Ha, and you called me a weird bird. (Diva snoring) (Emma groaning) (rooster crowing) (snoring) Going out already, dear? I'll be right with you. Must not let you out of my sight. Well... I'm just going to the bathroom. The is my bag du toilette. Goodness me. When I was your age, I needed a bag twice that size. And now look. Wow, a bag shop. Emma dear, don't forget to floss. I won't. What a darling. (Emma grunting) I told you she's not coming. Shh, I hear something. More smelly socks, I bet. (Junior squawking) I knew you'd come. How could I not? I would have come earlier, but the Diva was being super nosy. Now that you're here, you can help with the plan. You have a plan? Not in so many words, no. Let's just break into Block's cabin, and get back the eggs. Right, sure, easiest thing in the world. Are you insane! Put me on a plate and give me back the apple. What's the alternative? Sit around here and just be scared? I like the sound of that. I brought some equipment. But we have to learn how to use it. Wait a minute, who's giving the orders here? You are. And you're going to order Emma to handle the details, right? Yes, exactly. Emma, handle all the details, that's an order. I'm worried about that horrible, what was it called again? The cat. (growling) Don't worry, when the time comes, we'll find a solution. First, we have to get into shape for this mission. (fast music) (blowing whistle) (groaning) (blowing whistle) (growling) (laughing) (blowing whistle) Wow. (Junior squawking) Wait, before I forget, let's take a team photo. Bird seed! You made us small? It's a photo. So you can see what things look like. Here. Bird seed! It didn't work. You have to press the button. There. You know, I just had an idea for how we can deal with that scary cat. Well, and I thought I took a long time to get ready. I am a careful flosser. My little Lucy-woosie. Why are you suddenly so, ow! Good work, agent Jasper. We're proud of you. (laughing) Then we can read my diary. It's very exciting. And I can teach you how to lounge properly. It's practically a lost art. Whoops, I just remembered I forgot something. I'll go and get it, be right back. I'll save you a chair, dear. Now we're here. And this is where we're going. So we don't have much time. What is that thing? It's a model of the world. It's round? Of course it's round. Whoa! Wait, now it's flat. What is this? Hello, we'll do geography later. Anyone remember why we're here? The eggs? Yoo-hoo! I'm sorry, have you seen the Captain's little girl? She must try on her new dress, for her father's farewell party. All the passengers are going. Little Emma, I just saw her up on the sundeck, reading something educational. Thank you so much. I have a feeling I won't be able to slip away so easily again. We're doomed, doomed I tell you! Maybe not. I have an idea. He has an idea, like an idea is gonna help. Shh, what is it Jasper? The big lady said everybody is going to that party right? Well, not us obviously. I don't mind, I'm not really a party type. I prefer-- Shh, go on Jasper. That means Dr. Block and his big pal will be there. Which means he won't be in his cabin. So that's the perfect time for us to strike. Jasper, you're a genius. I wouldn't say genius. Anyway, I was just about to suggest that. To success! (Junior squawking) Look Jasper, the sun is going down. That's because the Earth is moving around it all the time. I learned that in science. Really, my dad always said it was a new sun every day, hatched by the sky. That's what he learned at school. Do you miss your mom and dad a lot? (sighing) But I bet they don't miss me. I was always causing trouble. I was supposed to be looking after Junior, you know. Don't worry, we'll find a way to bring Junior back. Emma? Yes, Jasper? I'm really glad I met you. You're the best friend I've ever had. Even if you are a human. That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me. It's time to stop talking to yourself, and get ready for bed, dear. Yes, right away! Good night, Jasper. Good night, Emma. (humming) Good evening, ladies. Come on, Kakapo, shake a feather! I thought we were going to Block's cabin. We are, through the ventilation system. I knew that. (Junior squawking) Wait a second, Kakapo. Shake a feather, wait a second... Make your mind up, will you? (Junior whimpering) Junior, whatever you do, don't let go of this rope. The whole mission depends on you, okay? You really think that'll keep him busy until we get back? It's an old penguin trick. Not much to do on the ice huh? How thoughtful of Dr. Block. I prefer water. I'm working on a new flavor. You might like that instead, Emily. It's Emma. Whatever. (dinging on glass) Ladies and gentlemen. Our voyage is nearly over. And I'm delighted it went so calmly and peacefully. I have an announcement to make. We have amongst us, a famous singer onboard. And I hope she will honor us with a song. May I present, Diva Svetlana Bolamova. (clapping) ♪ (piano music) ♪ ♪ (lyrics) Drink my darling, drink to me ♪ Drink to all that used to be ♪ Okay, this looks promising. Why have we stopped? My sixth sense is telling me the hatch is somewhere around here. Told you. Shh! Believe me, I'm shushed.

(Junior squawking) Whoa! Junior, you're supposed to be guarding the rope! Hey you big bag of fur! I'm talking to you! Yes you! (Junior squawking) You penguins know your ropes, I'll give you that. Well team, it looks like the special secret agent training has paid off. Oh... The babies, the beautiful babies. When I think of all they've been through... The eggs are ours, oops! (artificial laughter) Oh, Kakapo ♪ (lyrics) Things don't always go as planned ♪ (audience applauding) Bravo, bravo, bravo. Hurrah, very good, very, very good. Ooh. Huh? Oh. Stop him! Don't let him get away! Emma, what on Earth do you think you're doing? It's Dr. Block, Dad. He took the eggs. Oh, not the eggs again. What are you talking about? The Kakapo eggs, Dad. From secret agent Kakapo Kakapo, of Kakapo Island. I swear, you have to believe me. Just look in the blocky man's cabin and you'll see. Oh, the misery of too much imagination. Unhappy the children, and the grown-ups who have to listen to them. Dr. Block, if you wouldn't mind, we could settle this once and for all. But my dear Captain, I insist. Dr. Block, I apologize on behalf of my daughter. Again. But that can't be. A nice, strict boarding school is what she needs, Captain. With cold baths and porridge. (growling) (Emma screams) (random piano keys) We'll be docking soon. Please Dr. Block, you'll excuse me. Emma, I need... Emma, come back here this instant! The little toadstool is speedy though. You gotta give her that. (laughing) I don't think she'll be troubling us anymore. Now, let's see what the tide swept in. Is this what you were looking for? (laughing) So much wonderful fear. And the eggs will give me the essence of fear, that I need for my recipe. We're docking soon, boss. What do we do with the wildlife? The Kakapo with the eggs. We'll keep the small penguin for Lucifer. Throw the big one overboard. But penguins can swim, boss. Ouch! My goodness, you made an intelligent comment. It was an accident. No doubt. Well, I have a better idea for the pesky penguin. (laughing) Jasper? Junior? Kakapo? Where are you? (dramatic music) (muffled) Junior! Emma! Kakapo! (foghorn) (foghorn) (sighing) Oh, Emma dear. I didn't see you on deck. And I just wanted to say farewell. Dad says I have to stay in the cabin until I learn how to behave. There's nothing wrong with an overactive imagination. But maybe you have to learn to control it a little. Or turn it into a career, like I did. You don't believe me either, do you? Never worry about what other people think. What's important is, what you think. Goodbye my dear. Bye. You've caused enough trouble for one day. Jasper, I want you to watch Junior, while we go and clear up the mess you made, alright? (breathing heavily) Hold on, Junior! I'm on my way! Hurry up with those boxes. (Junior squawking) (Junior squawking) Junior! Jasper! Junior! Don't go in there by yourself, Jasper! Emma, I have to. They've got Junior! Jasper, wait for me! Emma, we're there. Emma, darling, I know it was hard for you to be cooped up on this ship, all alone with nothing to do, for the last few days. Grown-ups can be a bit hard to understand. Even Dads sometimes. But I promise you. As soon as I can, I'll... Back in the box, midget! (Junior squawking) Junior? More ventilation systems. (beeping) (machines whirring) Home, vile home. (inhales deeply) Ahh, breathe those fumes. Incense, from the temple of chemistry. Rolf? Hey boss, look who I found snooping around outside. You greedy slobber-monster! Put me down right now! What a pleasant surprise! Not so pleasant for you, of course. Put her with her friends, Rolf. So she can spy to her heart's content. Emma! (Junior squawking) Let me go, let me go! Or I'll tell my dad! Even if you could, he'd never believe you. Poor little Erma. It's Emma! If you say so. (laughing) I'll make my dad believe me. Not after you've had a glass of the new, improved Block's Best, you won't. (machines whirring) Bleh, I won't drink it! I don't even like your stupid lemonade! Ah, but I'm changing the recipe. (laughing) Watch. (gulps) Boo! (laughing) You see? The scardiest creature on the entire planet. The source of the special ingredient for my new lemonade. That's the meanest, rottenest thing I've ever heard. Thank you. Bleh! Good. You shall have the privilege of testing my new recipe. Feast your eyes on this. (beeping and booping) Behold, my Egg-O-Masher. Observe how the essence of terror is distilled from these timid Kakapos, and dropped into my new soda creation. Boo! (laughing) A good shake, and the masterpiece is complete! But why? Children who drink it, will be too scared to ever disobey their parents! I'll make millions. Millions, I tell you! My dad always says money isn't everything. Oh, yes it is. Rolf, start the Egg-O-Masher. (laughing) It's a privilege, boss. I'm overcome with emotion, to be at such an historical moment. Just do it. Hey! What's going on? Rolf, stop playing with the machines! It's not me, boss! Whoa. (screaming) Hang on! I'll save you, whoa, ouch! Not so happy now, huh? You again? (Junior squawking) Jasper, you made it. Did you bring help? A cop, a firefighter, a boy scout? Emma, watch out! Come to Rolf, you great chicken. (Kakapo screaming) Chicken, huh? I'm a fully-fledged Kakapo Haka master, mister. Ah-hoo-a-ha, hoo-a-ha-ha-ha. Thief, thief! Some honest person, stop that penguin! They're stealing my stolen eggs! Go on, save them! This way, quick. Are you sure? We've no choice! No, no, curses! Thieves, scoundrels, maggots! Give me back my eggs! Junior, watch it. Junior-agent, Junior... Am I glad you're on our side. (Rolf screaming) Whoa! Stop hanging around, and help me. Criminals, blast! Sulfurous vultures, you wait till I get my hands on you! No fair, cheaters! (breathing heavily) Going somewhere? (Junior squawking) Did you see that, did you see that? I didn't freeze, that's twice I didn't freeze. I'm over it, I'm over it! I'll never freeze again! What? (meowing) Whoa! Help! Thanks, boss. You've come to save me. You care more about me than about getting back at them. NO! Now you've hurt my feelings! Whoa! Fantastic, now I'm stuck. (alarm sounding) Uh-oh. I've got it, I've got it. I've got it! I've got it! (laughing) No, no hatching allowed! Yeah, hooray! Oh my darlings, my babies. You're ruining my beautiful plans. Wait, stop. Come back here. I'm not finished with you! Oh, yes you are! Look. (alarm sounding) We have to get out of here. Hey Doc, how do you like your eggs? Beaten? Eggs beaten, get it? Hello, boss. I'm not feeling good about this. No, my life's work! Emma? Where are you, Emma? Good heavens. I don't believe it. Two penguins, a green parrot, some baby birds and... Emma! Call the fire brigade and the police and send them to Block's factory. And the zoo. No, no don't call the zoo. Watch your step, Junior. Jasper, help. The chicks are in the water! I'll go get them. Emma, are you alright? Junior! Junior-agent, Junior, I hereby promote you to senior-agent, Junior. Yee-ha! (Junior squawking) Junior, you can swim? Emma. Dad. I'm really sorry I didn't believe you. How can I make it up to you. (whispering) Right now? You blabbering behemoth. I hold you entirely responsible for my downfall. Oh come on, boss. You helped too. (clears throat) (foghorn) (foghorn) Mom, Dad! Jasper! Jasper! Junior! Junior! You're back, you're back. Where have you been? We looked everywhere. Except maybe behind the icebergs. I tried to be a good penguin and look after Junior, Dad. I really did. Jasper, I'm the one who's sorry. You were right, son. And we're proud of you. And Junior looks fine. This is Emma. Mr. and Mrs. Penguin, I'm so pleased to meet you. She's not a human, she's a bird. By the powers vested in me, I hereby make her an honorary Kakapo. This is our fearless leader, Kakapo. A pleasure, Mom, Dad. I feel like I know you already. And by the way, everybody, I come from a place beyond the icebergs, with palm trees and surfboards and tequila sunrises, which is a drink with ice, but you know what ice is already. And warmth, which is, well forget it. Anyway, I wanted to say that Jasper was right, all along. So let's have a big hand for Jasper. Hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray! Well Jasper, you have certainly taught us something. Well, from now on, I will be adding a course to the curriculum, called Jasperography. Investigative geography. Our new motto is Wait And See. No, I mean, Let's Go And See. (foghorn) You must be really happy to be home again. But I'll miss you, Emma. And the others. If you want, you can come and visit me sometime. We could write to each other, too. And send a message in a bottle. That way, we'll know what's going on with each other. Bye, Jasper. Bye, Emma. Bye, Kakapo. See you soon, agent Jasper. We'll have another secret adventure! Bye-bye! Auf wiedersehen! Au revoir! Hasta la vista! Take it easy, kid! (Junior squawking) (whispering) Jasper? The teacher and I have been talking. I know I've missed some classes but-- It's much more serious than that. (whispering) (sighing) Message for you, young lady. Maybe it'll cheer you up a little. Dear Emma, I have been appointed official penguin ambassador of the South Pole. Asked to report on all strange things on the other side of the world. I hope to see you soon. Lots of love, Jasper. P.S. look behind you.
