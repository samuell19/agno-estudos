For his ceaseless efforts in bringing together the Islamic and Judeo-Christian world. To work for peace in the Middle East, we of the Soviet Peace and Brotherhood Union, award the president of the Friendship League, Mr. Anwar Mossach, our committee's International Prize For Peace. I, Khalil Kadal, shall be the deliverer of your retribution. You have one week in which to comply with my demands. If the president of the United States refuses to negotiate the complete withdrawal of all forms of Western interference in the Arab world, I will dispatch the American people to the hell they deserve. One week. The Russians want him and so do we. That is your target, Major Stewart. Khalil Kadal. What I don't understand, general, is why we don't send an F-16 strike in there and blow his ass straight to hell. Oh, I'd like nothing better, but the son of a bitch has his ham strung. His disciples make a hell of a delivery system. For all we know, major, walking down Fifth Avenue right now is one of his crazy followers ready to take out half of New York City. And the only way we can stop those guys is for Kadal himself to give the word. So we've got to take him alive. And we do it now. Now everything is okay. It is time. Everything is ready. Salim will deliver the bomb personally. You must treat it carefully. I have waited for this many years. Listen to me. What we have done up till now is nothing. This is a nuclear bomb. It will never be forgotten. Not in a thousand years. You can trust me. I've known you since you were a child. You are the only one I will trust to deliver our gift to the world. Kadal. Lieutenant Richard O'Keefe, sir. I'm your new intelligence officer. Put your hand down, Richard. Good to see you again, Charlie. Why isn't the camp ready Uh, it's been a bit of a rush job, sir. I see that. Any word from General Wilson Not yet, sir. I'm online with the Pentagon. Whatever you need, I'll get it for you. I wanna know everything about this guy Kadal. I wanna know his habits. Where he goes, what he eats, when he sleeps. I wanna know when he's taking a dump. Yes, sir. This is an urban attack. Hit and run. Our only objective is to get Kadal out alive-- I repeat, alive. --And not hit any civilians. Now, the front of the building's where the concentration of guards will be. Greg, you go up the back to the roof. Remember, you only got 15 seconds before the rest of us make our move. How many sentries Usually only the one. Ron, Jimbo. Sir. Yes, sir. You guys follow Greg up, make sure his ass stays clean. Sammy, you blow us in through the side. What kind of walls we got here Concrete. Eighteen inches thick. You can pick your spot. No sweat. Pound of C4, pinch of wire. They'll be seeing daylight. Yeah, well, just don't take the whole fucking building down like you did last time. Yeah, yeah. Any questions It's a piece of cake, sir. Not really. General Wilson has placed defenders in position. How many I don't know. So keep your eyes open. Kadal's stand-in will be wearing white. If you take a paint squib to the body or the head, you go down. No questions asked, no fooling around. And gentlemen, the general will be inside. Don't hit him. How many defenders are there Eighteen, sir. Okay. Sir. Regards, soldier. We're not here. How's the schedule Should be within the minute, sir. Fine. Come on. Ten segundos.

I'm sure the two of you will work well together. May I I'm impressed, lieutenant. Infrared scans Yes. But you stole them from a Soviet satellite, I think. Well, yours just happened to be in a better position than ours. So I just downlinked the transmission - and time-base corrected it. - Yeah. I just can't work out what this is over here. Oh. Those are caves at the base of a mountain. The Sudalians have converted them to a communications station. There's a tunnel that connects them to the fortress. That's our way in.

I have given you one week, and still your president has not responded. His impunity will be your destruction. There are only three days left. Then my messengers shall strike. Many people will have to pay with their lives. Sounds like intelligence was right. Then your president will talk to me. This is my final warning. Kadal! Kadal! Kadal! Kadal!

That was just part of a five minute videotape delivered to our Paris office yesterday, in which Khalil Kadal claims responsibility for the human bomb attacks. While these are the only two incidents Kadal has claimed responsibility for, intelligence experts all over the world say he's been behind the wave of devastating attacks recently. Like this one in Beirut two weeks ago, which killed 20 schoolchildren and wounded 80 others. in Northern Ireland where an entire block was virtually wiped out... Who is it It's me, Hussein. Come on.

He's gonna recognize them. The oscillograph is gonna give us a reading to confirm. My theory is, the only one in the photos he's gonna recognize are likely suspects. Washington is standing by to confirm. But it's still just a guess. It's the best we got right now. So, how accurate can you make it Irenia I'll show you. This is what we use. Together with the polygraph, we get 95 percent accuracy. I know he won't forgive you. Captain. Sister. Father. No. No. No. Major I think we got our man. Captain. Yeah. I'm quite sure.
