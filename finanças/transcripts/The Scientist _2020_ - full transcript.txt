It's December 9th, 2022. I'm Dr. Steve Unger. Here, we have patient number one, female, mid-20s to late 20s, no vital signs. Cause of death... Strangulation. I will administer five milliliters of test batch alpha, the results of which should yield... Life. Please. Let this one. She's alive! It's such a beautiful place. Wow, look at that! That moth is so amazing. The moth's a great mimic. To hide from predators, the moth can evolve to look like insects, such as a wasp or, even the tarantula. Okay, are you telling me that can turn into a tarantula? Yes. Hey, look it up in the Internet if you don't believe me. So gross, yet oddly beautiful. What if people were like moths, and this body of ours was only the beginning? What do you mean? Okay. Well, before it becomes a moth, a caterpillar has this transformative cells hidden within its body. And once it enters the cocoon, those transformative cells are released and they can become whatever it needs to survive. Who knows? Maybe we have those same transformative cells within us. And all we need to do is wake them up, then we can turn into some strange creature. But I think, I think I'm, I think I'm turning into one now. I'm uh, uh, uh. What? I'm coming for you now, Darlene. Coming for you, Darlene. Oh! Darlene, I have loved you since the first moment I've ever saw you. I'm no poet but this is as romantic as I thought it was in my head. You've been so patient with me after med school. You stood by my side when I couldn't even stand to be by myself. I can't imagine spending the rest of my life with anyone else but you. I promise to love you, cherish you, support you, and care for you. I will absolutely treasure you forever and ever if you promise to marry me. Darlene, will you marry me? Yes, of course. Are there any side effects that we should know about? She'll be tired. The pain medication will help with the headaches. The shot I'll administer will help with the nausea. You'll feel a little pinch, okay? As a hospice nurse, I'm here not only for your wife, but your entire family till the last stages of her life. You mentioned you have a daughter, correct? Lily. Lily. That's a beautiful name. Thank you. I'll help you and Lily get through this process. I'll make sure your wife is as comfortable as possible. Now, I've laid out some pamphlets that detail everything from symptoms to be aware of, as well as coping with family stress. Are there any other family members that should be present for these conversations? Her parents passed away a while ago. She has a brother, but he is not much into family. No worries. What about your occupation? I do research for a cosmetics lab, so my hours are pretty much nine to five. Just know I'm here to help, for as little or as much possible. It will help you and your daughter in this situation. There's no timetable when we can pinpoint when your wife will slip into a coma or pass. It can be weeks, months, so the sooner you address these things, the better. Do you have any questions so far? No. But thank you, for everything, Betty. I promised to always take care of you. You are, more than enough. Could've done something more to prevent all this. None of this is because you failed at something. I'm lucky to have married you. From this home, and life, to our beautiful daughter, I'm blessed. Mom! Dad? Speaking of. In here, sweetie. What are you all doing? It isn't bedtime. Of course not, sweetie. Mommy is just a little tired today. You're always tired, mommy. That's nothing new. Hey, why don't you tell us what you did in school today? Stars. Stars? What about the stars? There are bi-gillion, million of stars in the sky and the sun is a big star. That's right. Good job. Can we look at the stars tonight? We'll need to let mommy take a nap. And then, we can look at the stars later. Okay? Sweet dreams, mommy. Hey, kiddo. How would you feel about two of us taking a trip? Just us two. Where? - Where do you want? - New Mexico. It's odd. Why New Mexico? My teacher's from there and she said you can see tons of stars. All right then, New Mexico. How come mommy wanna come? Well, mommy is not gonna be able to do everything with us. Sometimes, it's just gonna be you and me. How do you feel about that? About what? If it was just you and me. My friend at school has two dads. Okay, but I don't think you'll gonna another dad, but what about a dad and a mom? No, that would be weird. Yeah. Come on. Let's go wake up mom for dinner, okay? Okay, here. Put this on, it's a little cold outside. Where's mom? Mom is still asleep. Still? Lazy mom. Your mom needs a lot of sleep these days, okay? - Okay. - All right. Go get your backpack. And this must be Lily. Lily, this is Betty. She's gonna make mommy feel better when we're away from home. Nice to meet you, Lily. Are you gonna help my mom with her headaches and from getting tired all the time? Well, I'm gonna try. We'll see, okay? You're off to school? Yeah, my dad walks me everyday before he goes to work. Well, that's nice of him. Such a good daddy he is. Hm, I think, yes, he's okay. Hey! Darlene's inside asleep. You have the code to get in? I do. Well, you have a good day, and maybe, after school, I'll meet you with some freshly baked cookies. - I like her. - Mm-hm. Come on, all right. Bye, thanks, Betty. Steve. Amigo. Are you all right? Let me show you this. Steve, this... This looks promising. Are these using the stem cell samples we got in yesterday? I tried a different approach from our previous attempts. I definitely see a lot of cell regeneration there. But I think we should show it to Dr. Berry. You used the neural stem cell samples we received from St. Louis? Yes, sir. Just the neural? Well, actually, I added embryonic cells as well. Robert, let me talk to Steve, alone. Where the fuck did you get the embryonic cells? We received the package from St. Louis that contained both the neural and the embryonic stem cells. So, you just up and decided to research with them without my approval? You like having a job? Making money? I don't know where you're planning to go with this. Stop wasting my fucking time trying to play savior, by creating cures for diseases we have no business treating. I make money to run this place, pay you a salary by developing cosmetic therapies to sell to the rich people in America, who have the money to pay for these treatments. Yeah, and we can continue to do that. But we could also develop groundbreaking treatments for lots of diseases. We have the capacity. You develop a cure for, let's say, something small, chicken pox. Great! No kid in America ever catches the disease again and it becomes obsolete. Guess who needs to buy your medication now. Nobody. And how much do you make when nobody needs your medication? Not a goddamn cent. There is never going to be a cure for cellulite as long as people enjoy eating. The goddamn Russian scientists are testing on humans and making a killing. It's all I wanna do here, and make you and I some money. Focus on the task I give you and you keep your job. Yes, sir. Think of your daughter. So, what did he say? Nothing. Just wants me to keep making plastic faces for rich people. Look, Steve, I'm with you. Yeah, I wish our jobs were more rewarding than they are. But it's a job, man. I'm sorry about Darlene. I pray for your family every night. But it truly is in God's hands, my friend. You know one thing he said that was right? As long as people keep getting rich off medications, then there's no incentive to find a cure. They'll say, "Keep the sick medicated, "keep the profits rolling then." Something there's got to change, all right? Our health care system, they're robbing us blind. We're just getting played by the system. I mean, as scientist, it's our responsibility to find a fix. If we don't, then nothing will ever change. I agree but there are rules, morals that we have to abide by, and if we don't, then we're no different. Are we? Hey, I'll keep praying for both of us. And give Darlene my best, huh? It's 90 degrees outside and it's December, and they tell us global warming isn't real. I know this is Texas but come on. Well, moving on to something that is real, did you hear about this strange story? An eight-year-old boy bitten by a wasp while vacationing with his parents in Costa Rica returned home deathly sick, but within a few days, recovered from his illness, and miraculously cured from a lifelong battle of his multiple sclerosis disease. Isn't that amazing? However, weeks after his stunning recovery, the boy slipped into a coma and eventually died. Doctors are still puzzled about his miraculous recovery and are trying to understand more about the boy's illness. They've sent cell sample to various labs - across the state... - Sorry. For further research in the hopes to learn more and possibly find... - Sorry. - A cure for MS. Have a nice day. Daddy! He-hey! How's my little one? - Good. - Good. Uh, oh, what's going on in here? Well, good evening, Mr. Unger. Just Steve is fine. Good evening, Steve. Hey. Hey, how are you feeling? Good. Betty just waited a bit until you got home. She cooked dinner for us. Oh, that was nice. Thank you, Betty. It's no problem at all. I even made Miss Lily some homemade mac and cheese. Yummy, right? A lot better than that bug stuff you make, dad. No offense. - Oh. - Oh, no offense, huh? The things they teach kids in school these days. Well, I better get going. You guys enjoy the dinner. Bye, Lily. Hey, Betty, why don't you stay? That is, unless you have other dinner plans. I can't say this single woman has any plans. So, Lily, do you mind if I stay? Do you have kids, Betty? No, I don't. Why? God didn't bless me with the ability to. Why would God do that? Lily, it's not nice to ask personal questions like that. No, it's okay. God has a plan for all of us. And we all play a role in each other's lives. And besides, I'm here to help with you and your family. Help us make yummy mac and cheese and cookies? Exactly. So, what have you discovered? A fix. No, no, this isn't right. Wait, wait, what isn't right about it? You're tampering with human DNA here. I mean, you're regenerating cells faster than anything I've ever seen possible. How did you even do this? You remember those cell samples we got from St. Louis? Yeah, the ones you showed me the other day. Yeah, well, those samples contained the cells of an eight-year-old boy who died from a disease contracted from a wasp bite in Costa Rica. But before he died, that same disease cured his multiple sclerosis. Right, so there's something there that we could tap into. I am close to getting it. This is dangerous stuff, man. Yo don't know what this can do long-term. We don't even do that kind of research here. But we have them now, okay? We could something of this, okay? We run a test. We inject the virus and follow it up with this serum. And we could come very close to finding a cure. A cure for what? For anything. Everything. Can you even imagine what that would be like? I know why you're doing this. Okay, I get it. But even if you did go through with any of this, this would never pass through any FDA regulations. Who or how would you even test? We don't even have that authority here. I mean, look at these mutations that are occurring in this sample. You can't fathom the consequences that could result from testing. Walk away from this. I'm really sorry I missed your dance recital, Lily. I've been working really hard to make mommy better. And you do want mommy to get better, don't you? You know, Betty, I really can't thank you enough for everything that you've been doing around here, all your help. I can't even imagine what life would be like here without you. You're welcome. Did you all eat dinner? Yeah, we did. Are you hungry? Mm, no. No, just tired. This medication makes me so sleepy. Sorry for being mad at you. Are you mad at me? - Before. - When? Forgetting me at dance rehearsal. Hey. I didn't forget about you. I was just late. I know. I need to be more tough and not such a baby anymore. I know mom is sick and we need to be tough for her. I made this for you to protect us from being sick. You promise to wear it? I'll never take it off. Good night, sweetheart. Sweet dreams, daddy. Earth to Steve. Hey, beautiful. Did your work allow you to take all this equipment home with you? I think borrow would be a better word than take. So what are you so obsessed with out here that I don't see you as much? I've had a breakthrough in my research. I just need to dedicate more time to it. Look, I promise, I'm going to fix you. I'm so close... - Steve. - To finally finding... Steve! Steve, all I want is you and Lily to spend whatever time is left, with me. It's too away for any of this, Steve. No. I'll make more time. Look, all I have to do is perfect it. And it might... No, it will cure you. I just have to hurry because I won't lose you. Okay, I understand that, that this is your way of dealing with the situation, to fix it. But I don't you to fix me. I need you to just lay down with me and accept this, together, 'cause I'm trying to keep it together. I'm scared. I'm scared of not leaving a perfect home. I'm scared of, I'm scared of Lily growing up with anger. I'm scared of you being lonely for the rest of your life. But also of not remembering me if you do move on. No. No. No, that's not gonna happen. No, it's not gonna happen. You wanna know why? Because you are not going anywhere. You're gonna stay right here with me, forever. All right? - I love you. - I love you. Today is December 6, 2022. I'm Dr. Steven Unger, and today I will proceed with the first test of batch alpha on subject A, mouse. Subject A is free of ailment and disease, so I will administer a lethal virus, and upon death, will then administer two milliliters of test batch alpha, the results of which should return subject A back to life. Subject A is now deceased. So, I'll administer two milliliters test batch alpha. My god. After two-milliliter dosage of test batch alpha, subject A has returned to life. All bodily functions appear normal. Dad, it's mom! Dad! Dad, help, please! Dad, mom needs help, quick! Dad! What's going on? Daddy, what's going on? Daddy, please answer me. Daddy! - Go wait in the living room. - Daddy. What are you, crazy fucker? Why are you fucking with me like that? You try that shit again, I'll kick some ass. I'll be okay, if you could fix her. For a long as you can fix her. I've always hated the name my mom gave me. Minerva. I mean, what is that? But my mom, the hippie , so, it was just like her to name someone something so a lot. That's why people call me Minnie, because I'm so tiny. But, I mean, I think I'm starting to like it a little bit. I looked it up and it means goddess of wisdom. That's not too bad, right? It's kinda cool. So... Are you gonna kiss me, or what? I'm sorry. Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh. Quiet! Shh, shh. Quiet! Let's get to the car. Hurry! Shut up! No, no, no no. No, no, no, no, no, wake up. Come on, wake up. Wake up, wake up, don't. No, no, no. No, don't go. Damn! What are you doing, daddy? Get out of here, Lily. This isn't a place to be playing around. You need some help with that? No, thanks. I'm just taking out some old trash. Well, Lily came in crying. I just want to see if everything was okay. Everything is okay. I'm good. That looks really heavy. Yes. I'm good. You should probably go inside and, see if Lily needs any help. - Steve. - What? Oh, sorry. Did I wake you? Kiss me. Kiss. Kiss me. Kiss me right now. Kiss me. Kiss me. Kiss me. You look tired. I'm not defeated. Now that's what I'm afraid of. Come lay with me. Promise me that whatever it is you're doing, it won't jeopardize everything we've built so far. I promise. How you feeling, kiddo? Don't lose this one. Yes, sorry. I must have misplaced the other one. I promise to take good care of this one, okay? I can't keep letting you do this. You can't play God. What are you gonna do? Report me? Listen. As a friend, I know you're hurting, man. You're trying everything that you can do to help, but you... Hey, you have no idea what I am going through, okay, because you do not have the urgency that I have as a husband, as a father, who'll do anything he can to keep his family together. Not this way. Whatever you're doing is not controlled. It's not regulated. I have to stop you. Stay out of it or you're gonna get hurt. Stay out of it. Police investigating a missing person case are asking for the public's help. The woman seen in this video, 28-year-old Minerva Wilson, was last seen walking out of the bar with this unidentified man. Police are asking for the public's help on identifying this man, or the whereabouts of Minerva Wilson. Steve? Are you in there? I'm going home for the evening. Call me if you need me, okay? Steve? Yeah, I'm here. You should really get some rest. I know, I'm just, really haven't seen you very much. I know. Just promise me that when things get closer, you'll just lay down with me more, please. Hey. There's gonna be plenty of time for that later. I promise. All right? Betty. Come on, Betty. Come on. Okay. Okay. Dad? Are you in there? Hello? Who's in there, daddy? Nothing, sweetie. I've just got some work in there. I've got some dangerous equipment that I don't want you to touch. So don't ever go in there, okay? Okay. Promise me, Lily. Never go in there. I promise. Good. All right, let's get you to school. It's fascinating, isn't it? What have you done, Steve? You know how they got the flu shot? Neurologists in Michigan in the early 40s deliberately infected patients at the mental hospital with the influenza virus. You know, there was some trouble in there and dozens of death. Viola! Got a vaccine. You know, I'm this close. This close to developing something that will change the world. And people will look back at all of this and say that it was necessary to advance health, science, and sacrifices the few to save the many. There'll be some casualties along the way. But they are just as much a part of this discovery as I am. You see that now? The work I'd do will save lives, keep families together. It will end suffering. And you don't think she's suffering? She... She promised to help me any way that she could. She is helping me. She's helping my family! She's helping your family. She is helping millions of others out there. I'll pray for you. Well, save your prayer! Welcome back to the land of the living. How are you feeling? I'm truly dying to know. You know, I always told that I would succeed. You could have been here, right alongside me, changing the world. It's too bad that you won't get to see it. Sorry, you had to see that, Betty. Really, I am. But don't worry. You won't suffer the same fate. I promise. Thank you, honey. Where's Betty? I sent her home. We don't need nurses anymore. What's wrong? I don't know what. Betty's gone. I don't know what you're doing. I don't know where Lily is. Hey. Honey, it's okay. Lily is in the other room having dinner. Everything hurts. Hey, hey, hey. This time next week, we're gonna be dancing. Test subjects shows no further signs of development. No pupils. Body motions still irregular. Agitated. No vocal capabilities. Still no signs of basic human communication. I'll continue study for two more days. If no further development, I will terminate test subject. What are they doing? Are those security cameras? Lily! Lily. No, no, no, no, no. No. Oh, baby. Baby. Oh, sweetie. Okay, come on. Come on, baby. The police. Open up! Ma'am? You're okay? What in the world. Mom? Mom?
