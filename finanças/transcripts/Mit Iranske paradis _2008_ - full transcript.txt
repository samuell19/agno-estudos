To me, Iran has always been the happiest place under the sun. It's where I spent the first 22 years of my life. Since then, the appearance of Iran has changed. Death to the Shah! Death to the Shah! I had settled in Denmark. One fine day in the 80s I heard some people speak Farsi. A language I knew so well. They were Iranians, who had fled the bloody Islamic Revolution. DON'T DEPORT Their stories were incomprehensible to me. Many years have passed. Only now have I been able to pluck up my courage to go back - - and see what happened to my childhood paradise. As a child, I saw a dancing dervish on the borderline of Turkey and Iran. He danced and danced and danced. He taught me a poem I never since forgot. My heart is so small that it can barely be seen Tell me, how can it carry 0 heavy a sormow Open your eyes, he said Your eyes are even smaller And yet, they can capture the whole world - Hello, welcome to my country. - Thank you. If's also mine in a way. You will see that things are very different now - - and that the conditions for women are more difficult than ever. How so? Here I learned to walk. Here I learned to read. Tehran. My beloved city. Do you remember the street going uphill? It was called Amir-Atabak. On your right, it's Bahar-Shiraz. And on your left Amir-Atabak. - To Amjadieh square. - And Malayeripoor Street. - Comer of Somayeh and Mofateh. - The Somayeh intersection? - Comer of Somayeh and Mofateh. - The Somayeh intersection? Continuing from there, you can ask for directions. Thank you very much. The streets have new names. I haven't been here in over 30 years. Although I was born in Denmark and only ever had a Danish passport - - I never really felt like I belonged there. Where do you belong? Where you were born, or where you grew up? - That's the street you're looking for. - Thank you. How is it that you speak Farsi so well? This is the street of my childhood. My father was Danish, and my mother Polish. My father worked as an engineer. We were 'Kharedji', the Persian term for foreigner or stranger. My parents led a western lifestyle. They lived a life of their own behind high walls. From the street, I'd hear my mother playing the piano. Then I knew she was home. The street was my playground. Each day in the driveway, the opium lady squatted by the stairs, smoking. Although she only smoked a pipe of tobacco in the street - - the smell of opium surrounded her. Smoking opium was actually prohibited - - but old people were allowed to uphold the tradition. I got my first chador, when I was 4. It was given to me by my Iranian nanny. Growing up, I was like a chameleon shifting between two worlds. One at home and another in the street. My best friends were the Iranian twin boys, Hassan and Hossein. Their religious parents had named the boys after two holy martyrs. It was Hassan and Hossein who laughed at me - - and said that Santa Claus was a big lie. That was the first time I felt that there was a difference between us. But I didn't want to show it. 1 didn’t want to be different. When I put on my chador, I was more Iranian than the Iranians. No one could tell any difference at all. When going to school, I'd walk from my European home - - where I spoke Danish and Polish - - through the streets of Tehran, speaking the Persian language, Farsi. In school we were taught by nuns. Although they looked different, they were respected everywhere. The school was called Jeanne d'Arc, and there we spoke French. Now it's called Martyr Radigil School, but the street is still' Jeanne Dare. Is he a martyr from the Iran-Iraq war? No, he was our Premier. He was assassinated in an explosion. In The Name of Allah Our Loving And Forgiving God My school was a Catholic girls' school - - and the pupils represented all sorts of religions. Many of them were Muslims. But only the Catholic children had to go to church. It was the thing to exchange religious pictures. My father was a Protestant, but I was raised a Catholic as my mother. My father was a Protestant, but I was raised a Catholic as my mother. The Catholic church demanded this of children in mixed marriages. At communion you had to look exceedingly holy and pious. Even my mother thought it was too much. But I wasn't aware of the powerful religious signals of my dress. I passed my exam. Thanks, Mona. In my time, there was a crucifix above the blackboard. Now the great Ayatollah looks down upon me. In the street, we're guarded by the religious leaders. And by a martyr. In Persian culture, suffering has always been cherished. In art as well as in religion. I remember the men in black clothes - - who would sometimes walk in procession in the streets of Tehran. Every year, my nanny would take me to Ashura, a Shiite feast. Most foreigners did not understand what was going on - - and they remained indoors during religious processions. Some of the men wore green caps. They were Seyyeds. Holy men. I trust you are doing well? - Thank you. Bless you. And you? - 1 am well, thank you. Thank you. - You are a Seyyed? - Yes. - What is a Seyyed? - A descendant of the Prophet. Generation after generation after the Prophet. How can you be certain? Because both my father and grandfather were Seyyeds. My grandfather told my father, who then told me. Just like you know your father and your grandfather. Generation upon generation. This is what's peculiar about Iran. That the prophet's descendants walk around among us. Bye, Seyyed. It's almost time for Friday prayer. I've accidentally strayed into a major political event. I'm not at all dressed for this. I'd better find the women's section. My Iranian friends always told me - - that what they remembered the best from their childhood - - was the scent of their mother's chador. When I lived here, only the highly religious women wore chadors. Today, every woman is obliged to cover herself up. If ever an Iranian woman covers up her face - - it's either because she's shy, or because she desires anonymity. Reza Khan, the old shah, strongly opposed the chador. My grandmother told me that women in the streets - - would get their chadors tom off by Reza Shah's soldiers. She also said that, for fear of the soldiers, the women stayed at home. And if they had to leave the house, they'd wear a hat to hide their shame. And if they had to leave the house, they'd wear a hat to hide their shame. So, the question is: Where are the women's rights - - to decide whether or not to cover themselves. Tell me, where are those rights? No matter if the system is oriented towards the West - - and claims to support human rights or it's an Islamic system - - where are the women's rights? I need a black scarf. Like that one, but black. - Mine keeps gliding down. - Don't they wear scarves over there? - No. - Never? - No, never. - Poor us. How do you feel about the obligatory dress? Which feelings does it evoke in you? They've forced you to dress like us. All of us looking alike. Like a disciple or a prisoner. You'll get used to it. But you will be alone with your thoughts. And in order for you to be true to yourself - - you must lead a double life. Like the rest of us. Here, in wealthy Northern Tehran, I see - - many women challenge the strict dress code in spite of the fact - - that they know they can be punished for it. You cannot take away the vanity of the Iranian woman. Nose jobs are highest fashion. They must be smaller. It's always been like that, but now also the men do it. They cherish and nurture their most beautiful possession: Their faces. The displays reveal to me what the women wear at home. Behind the walls, when they take off their chadors. Women approach me. They want to unburden their hearts. They want to tell their story, and share their thoughts with me. 1 too must adapt - - and hide the femininity which lies in one's hair. I find that I am beginning to have fun choosing scarves. This is the railroad that brought my father to Iran. In 1933, Shah Reza Khan solicited the Danish engineer company Kampsax - - to build a railroad across Iran. One task was bigger than all other: Building a railroad from north to south, 1,400 kilometres long. My father was one of the many Scandinavian engineers - - who fled the unemployment of the 30s - - and sought out challenges in far-away Iran. He was only 24, when he left Denmark. It was before I was born - -and I only have a vague sense of his first working years. No roads and no means of modern transportation. Quite a difference from building a railroad in Denmark. We all tried it in school, but here it's for real. We all tried it in school, but here it's for real. My father frequently wrote to his siblings, whom he missed very much. He amused himself by using the Persian calendar. In a letter dated 28th Mehr 1314, he talks of the strenuous working life. "Two Norwegians just arrived. They were immediately shipped to lot 5, south - - where the temperature reaches 55 degrees - - and people get dysentery from the heat and lack of fresh foods. I'd hate to put my health on stake for this," he states conclusively. My father could talk for hours about the construction of the railroad. He never again built anything like it. It turned out to be his life's work. That mountain is in the way. 4 million kilograms of dynamite for the construction of the railroad. 2 million m3 of brick wall. 250 bridges. 55,000 workers. 600 million work hours. Do not lean out A Persian love poem. And to my astonishment, an old Danish car with Danish instructions. This is the route. At the bottom of the valley, the climb begins. The railway runs on three floors, or ramps, as they are called. It's the only way in which to ascend. At the very top, this winding road ends in a big 8-shaped structure. Perhaps it's the only railway in the world ever built that way. In 1938, the railroad was ready to be put into service. The construction was the prestige project of the old Shah. The bridge over Vresk was its crown jewel. My father told me that he used to bring water to the workers with horses. He said it was very hard. - Was there no other way? - No, it had to be done by horse. - Hello, I trust you are well? - Thank you, and I trust you are, too. This grave is from when the railroad was built. It belongs to one of the builders and is from around 1300-1310. Unfortunately, we don't know if he was an engineer or a worker. A frame here said: Daniel Mostadin, and there was also a sign with a star. The city council wants to renovate the grave - - so we need to know about the customs of his culture. - Did the star look like this? - Yes, but now 2 beams are missing. - Did the star look like this? - Yes, but now 2 beams are missing. - It's the star of David. - Star of David? - Write his name in European letters. - European? It was in English before. That's the same as the European. I wonder if the family of this Jewish man know - - that a small village tend to his grave. When they built this railroad, they only had shovels, picks and dynamite. They didn't have all the modern tools of today. Even getting water supplies up the steep hill was a challenge. 1 think this is one of the wonders of the world. Just as God created the mountain he also created this railroad - - in the sense that God inspired the engineers, the workers - - and the bricklayers to do the job. That's how I see it. - This must be the women's section? - Hello. I'm so exhausted. Thank you. - What's in the box? - A vacuum cleaner. A vacuum cleaner? For whom? - For me. - Why? - Because I'm going to be a bride. - Really? Yes, and one has to bring all the things you'd need in a home. Furniture, refrigerator and freezer, washing machine, vacuum cleaner. Everything you can imagine. Even a month's worth of groceries. I've spent what I should on making his home. Now it's his turn to buy my wedding dress and arrange my party. - How did you get all that money? - I worked very hard. As an independent woman, 1 don't have to rely on my family. I've handled everything myself. But people have become materialistic. Many families don't have the means but put pressure on themselves - - to live up to other families. After the railroad, my father worked for the Iranian Ministry of Transport - - responsible for the railroad and general infrastructure. But he missed Denmark. "When I'm homesick, I long for all of you. How wonderful it will be to see you all again. You probably changed very much. The youngest in particular. It annoys me that I didn't get to come home on vacation this year. But I hang my hopes on next summer." But nor did he come to Denmark the following summer. The Second World War broke out. All contact with the family was interrupted. All contact with the family was interrupted. Twelve whole years would go by, before my father saw his family again. But the Second World War brought my parents together. The war broke out in Europe, when Hitler's army attacked Poland. My mother was living in Lithuania, which was Polish at the time. She was a student at the university in Vilnius. Hitler and Stalin had conspired to divide Poland among themselves. Hence, Poland was also attacked from the east by Stalin’s troops. Ina very short time, Stalin carried out an ethnic cleansing - - in the Ukraine and in Lithuania. 1.7 million people of Polish heritage were deported to the Gulag in Siberia. My mother was amongst them. There were children. There were women. There were men. And there, they were put to forced labour in work camps - - far out in the wilderness, where humanity had ceased to exist. Whenever I asked my mother about her captivity in Siberia - - she'd smile and caress my face. When my mother was alive, I never wondered about it. Was she trying to forget it? Or was she trying to spare me? When the prisoners had lost all hope of ever returning to civilization - - there was a surprising political turn of events. Hitler broke the non-aggression pact with Stalin. Stalin then changed sides and joined the Allies. Stalin issued amnesty to the prisoners of the Gulag camps. They could be used elsewhere. Of the 1.7 million Polish prisoners only half had survived. Among them my mother. Rumour had it that one could join the Polish army - - which was being formed in the Soviet province of Kazakhstan. My mother was close to dying but managed to gather the strength - - to travel thousands of miles to the rallying ground. At the age of 20, she became a soldier in the Polish army. But the Poles lacked both food and weapons - - so the Polish General Anders succeeded in persuading Stalin - - to let the Polish army go and join the British army in Iran. The route out of the Soviet Union went via the Caspian Sea. To freedom. To Iran. In the West, Iran is better known as a country you flee from - - than as a country that shelters refugees. That summer of 1942 Iran received, on this beach - - 118,000 soldiers and 44,000 civilian refugees. - This is from the staircase outside. - These are the stairs? Yes, the stairs. No, the other way. - My eyesight isn't very good. - Everyone was in uniform. Yes, they were all soldiers. - They came on the 3rd of Shahrivar. - On the 3rd of Shahrivar? Yes, in 1320. 1320 ... when was that going by a Western calendar? - It's 85 years ago. - How old are you, Mr. Musa? Me? I'm around 72-73 years old. Me? I'm around 72-73 years old. So, you were 8 or 9 at the time. Did you watch them as a child? Yes. We were fold they were prisoners of war. - What were they like? - Very charismatic. When they put on their uniforms, they looked very elegant. Most of them had blue eyes. Blond hair and blue eyes. We call it azure blue. They were good people. Yes, they were. Back in Denmark ['ve often wondered what happened to my friends - - who stayed in Iran following the Islamic Revolution. I tried to seek them out, but the only one I could find - - was a Polish woman, Anna, who travelled with my mother - - from Siberia to Iran. She is sill alive. She married an Iranian. Hello. You shouldn't have ... I am so happy. - Can I use your first name? - Yes. Seeing as you're 0 much younger than me. - Your mother had blond hair. - Yes, and blue eyes. I was very fond of her. She visited you and took me along, when [ was a child. - Oh, you little girl. - Yes. - Lock, that's me ... - You found yourself. It must be from the Polish Club. This must be from General Anders' army? It's when the Polish army was formed, when we arrived in Tehran. I remember how beautiful it was here in Pahlavi. We were immediately told to undress. They had built wooden cabins especially for us. And the best part was ... We all stood there, 30 of us - -in 2 lines - - when suddenly, three young Persian men came in. The water had stopped running - - both the cold and the warm water, because it was all built so fast. They were such nice young men. They didn't look at us at all, and we stood naked like this. Your mother, me and all the others. They fixed it and left. We continued bathing. We got out and received nice clothes. The old ones were burnt. We had lice. I have pictures of us with our heads shaved. They were ill and exhausted from the long journey. And they were not used to eating. Suddenly they had food to eat, but their bodies couldn't take it. Many died here on the beach, when they had finally found freedom. The Polish Cemetery - May I come in? - Yes, please do. - Hello, may your work be blessed. - Thank you, and you. Welcome. - Are you the caretaker here? - Yes. Is it a child resting here? - It is ... a child of two months? - Yes. What a fate. The plan of God the Almighty can never be foretold. All of them in only 3 days. Imagine. 600 people in only 3 days. Many have no name or identity. There are many graves that never receive a visitor. I come instead, and then I've done a good deed. I come here, whenever I'm sad. They are strangers, and so am I. It brings me comfort. When I pray to them, they fulfill my prayers. But their religion is different from yours? There's no difference. No, sweetie, we both believe in the Holy Mary. We all have the same god. It's we people who create the differences. How true. It's a generous sea. It's the sea that gave my mother her life back. Until her final breath, my mother was deeply grateful for the generosity - - shown to her by the Persian people. And this gratitude is deeply rooted in me as well. Maybe it's because my mother rediscovered hope here - - that we returned year after year to this very same beach - - that we called the Polish beach. Keep a distance of 500 metres to the women's wall. Violation is punishable by law. It's the same sand and the same sea. But only the men are allowed to go swimming. It is prohibited for women to show their bodies on public beaches. Women may only bathe within their own area - - which is inside an enclosement that stretches far into the sea. A few months later, in 1942 - - the Polish-British army marched on to Tehran. Dashing as they were - - the Polish women soldiers made quite an impression in the capital. Were I to use today's terms, my mother was a refugee - - and my father was a migrant worker. They met at a bridge tournament. They fell in love. My mother got permission to leave the army, and they got married. My mother advanced from stateless refugee to Danish citizen. But they would live in a country for 40 years - - in which they were both foreigners. - Did she marry here? - Yes, in Tehran. - Is she in Tehran now? - No, she passed away. May she rest in peace. The fate of man is unpredictable. Where one is born, where one dies. Poland's in one place and Iran's in another. Some died here while others travelled on and married. Man's destiny cannot be foretold. True. They're so beautiful ... I'm following in the footsteps of my parents here in Iran. Yes? - My mother and father's. - So late? - My mother and father's. - So late? - Yes, I regret that. - Its so late. - I've been afraid of coming to Iran. - Why? Because of the Islamic Revolution. In Denmark, I had no idea what was going on here. - And now we may have a war. - Yes. - Maybe Iran, too. - Yes, and that frightens me. She's lived in this country for 60 years. And she still feels like a guest. Every Sunday Anna, my mother and all the other women - - would meet in the Catholic church. The church was an oasis - - where the women could gather and speak their own language. It was a link to their heritage. Most of them were married to Iranians. And many had been forced to officially convert to Islam. So, their church attendance was kept discreet. One tried to lead a secure life and stay out of politics. 1 know the feeling of not belonging. Of being a foreigner. I know what it is to be tom. To not belong here nor there. I've been in exile. The life away from the homeland is very painful - - and when you return, you're met with hurtful remarks such as: "You took the easy way out and fled." "You act like an onlooker, shouting your advice.” Yes, one shouldn't condemn those who flee for their lives. Once a refugee, always a refugee. Life in exile is perpetual torture. I drank it in with my mother's milk. I learned to live with the pain. Learned to adapt and keep a low profile. I think my parents chose to do the same. But they were yet again to experience - - their lives threatened by great political conflicts. One day, disturbances broke out. I was 7 years old. My mother was afraid, and so was I. 1 didn't understand why she said: "The Bolshevists are here too now. The communists are coming.” The problem was the black gold. If Iran didn't have oil, it would be the happiest country in the world. History has shown how closely related religion, oil and politics are. England had acquired the rights to Iran’s subsoil - - in return for 5% of the profits. The oil money only benefited a fraction of the population. The young shah, who now occupied the throne - - had no intentions of opposing the British. Someone else had the courage, though. In the whole course of our history - - we've only had one democratically elected Premier: I refer to Dr. Mohammad Mossadeg. Dr. Mossadeq declared that the oil of Iran was the property of the state - - and fried to stop the oil from being sold cheaply to foreign companies. I noticed how other foreigners started leaving Iran. It was mostly women and children who fled in haste. And some of my friends from the French school also left. But my family stayed on. Mossadeq had many enemies domestically as well as abroad. The Security Council is not competent to evaluate this plan. And what happened next? Arumour was started that Mossadeq was a communist and pro-Russia. But it was a false rumour aimed at hurting Mossadeq. The Shah then fled Iran. Shortly after, they brought the Shah back, and everything was like before. Shortly after, they brought the Shah back, and everything was like before. The Iranians soon realised that things were controlled by the US and CIA - - and that they had staged the return of the Shah. Mossadeq, who for a brief moment was successful in nationalizing the oil - - and freeing his people, was put into house arrest. My beloved Mossadeq, tell me that you are not ill. Come home, beloved, and I will bring you sugar water. I learned the political poem about Mossadeq from my street friends. They said it was dangerous. You couldn't say it out loud. You know ... 1 think that if the West hadn't interfered - - the situation in the Middle East would be different today. There would have been no shah, nor mullahs - - and maybe Iran would have been a free democratic country. After the coup against Mossadeq, the power of the Shah increased. Like his father, he wished for Iran - - to adopt a more Western lifestyle and culture. Small and big companies from all over the world - - were, like the classic gold diggers, attracted by the black gold. We were still living there. And as time went by, the gap between ourselves and Denmark widened. Iran had become our second fatherland. My father's letters to his sister were less frequent - - and I grew up sensing that we were only visitors - - when we came to Denmark for summer vacation every other year. My father's letter to his sister, 1958: "It's getting increasingly difficult to find the time to write. We are extremely busy with road projects. The family is well, and Annette has just started high school. The oil wells pumped blood into the Iranian economy. We'd gotten rid of the British, but now had the Americans instead. During the reign of the Shah, Americans in Iran felt superior. The Shah passed a law that offered immunity to American soldiers. But among the people, there was growing resentment of the Americans. Western influence provided the Shah with enemies - - both among intellectuals and religious people. A certain Ayatollah Khomeini, then a high-ranking priest - - in the sacred city of Qom, opposed the Shah. He accused the Shah of degrading the Iranian people - - to be inferior to an American dog. For if you ran over a dog in America, you'd be penalized in court. But should an American, according to the new law, run over an Iranian - - he could do so without being punished. The Shah then banished Khomeini and condemned him to a life in exile. The Shah was usually much more severe with his opponents. His secret police was feared by everyone. There was no freedom or justice. I mean, no freedom of expression or freedom of the press. There was great disparity between the rich and the poor. And anyone, who criticized this, was imprisoned or executed. The demarcation lines were being drawn, but not many realized it. I was 19 and worked as an English newscaster on Iranian TV. Although I was aware of the political tension, I chose to turn a blind eye. I loved life in Tehran. It was my city. I was part of it all. And on the face of it - - there was no difference between we foreigners and Iranians. But a proper Iranian girl did not date, did not kiss - - and certainly did not have sex before marriage. But that's what one did. Marriages were usually arranged by the male heads of the family. My girlfriends were expected to be virgins. Those who weren't, had it fixed at a clinic. The Shah grew in his own image of himself - - and increasingly lost touch with reality. He crowned himself emperor of all emperors: Shah in Shah. The entire international political elite was in attendance - - at one of the cradles of Westem culture, Persepolis - - to celebrate the 2500-year anniversary of the Persian empire. Celebrating Persia's 2500-year anniversary, the people - - led by the Shah, emperor - - Mohammad Reza Pahlavi Arya Mehr, Shah in Shah - - show their respect at the tomb of Cyrus the Great, the first shah. His camp, if you can call it that - - is in the shape of a 5-beam star representing the 5 continents. The Danish Royal family sat in the place of honours. King Frederik sat next to the empress - - and Queen Ingrid had the honour of sitting next to the Shah himself. Your Majesties, Honoured Presidents, Your Highnesses - - Eminences, Excellences, First ladies and Gentlemen. As in a fairy tale, there were some the Shah had forgotten to swear in. As in a fairy tale, there were some the Shah had forgotten to swear in. The religious leaders of the country. Who would have guessed that the days of his monarchy were numbered. Death to the Shah! Death to the Shah ... When the revolution came - - my father was retired, and we had returned to Europe. I experienced the revolution from afar. I couldn't believe my eyes. There were people from all layers of society. And there were young women from my circle. I was against the Shah and supported the Islamic Revolution. Many others did so, too, but not necessarily for religious reasons. I am going on a journey ... The Shah fled. He knocked on doors in one country after another - - looking up friends from his days of greatness, but in vain. No one would offer him asylum. I rejoiced on the day Khomeini returned to Tehran. If you look closely at the footage, you'll see me in the front row - - as part of the chain forming in front of Khomeini. The Great Ayatollah Has Returned When Khomeini gave his first speech in Behesht-Zahra - - I sensed from his voice that he was a person yearning for power - -who, instead of saying "we" - - said "I will shut the mouth of this government.” "I will form a new government." As if he was planning his own private political revenge. 1 will form a government. 1 will form a government backed by the people. 1 do this, knowing that I have the support of the people ... In his tone of voice there was no love of the poor. So, I quickly became one of his opponents. 1 found it hard to keep quiet. I didn't hide what I stood for, and soon after I was arrested. Jail was a very painful experience. And for the first time in my life, I felt genuine fear. One day, when I was taken from my cell on my daily walk - - I saw people walking through an intersection in the distance. In my despair, I wished that I could call out to them - - and tell people what goes on behind these high walls. About all the people tortured and executed here every day. I am so sorry to hear what you had to go through. Did you expect something different from the Islamic Revolution? Yes, we expected it to get better - - and we expected more justice. And that women would achieve equality. For a brief moment, we thought that real change was coming. Its been many years since the Islamic Revolution - - and there are still a lot of problems in Iran. Jails are still full of free-thinking people. Many of them women. The revolution changed many lives. Destinies were moved about as pawns in the political game - - and the West was flooded with Iranian refugees. I've travelled to Qom. I never thought I'd ever come to this place. Qom is the city of the mullahs. It's one of the holiest places in Iran. This is where the Islamic Revolution was born. If I want to understand the country 50 dear to me - - I've realized, that I have to see Qom. A Dervish! I haven't seen a Dervish in ages. It's as if time has stood still - - and nothing has changed since One Thousand and One Nights. This city of the mullahs has a female guardian angel: The Holy Masume. I am visiting Seyyed, whom I met in Tehran. Every other week he goes home to his family in Qom. People here are strong believers and practice their religion. They are very religious in general. You must earn your place to be in Qom. If you sleep here for three nights, you'll earn a place in heaven. You have now slept here one night. God willing you'll be back one night each year, and heaven will open up. This family follows the religious recipe on how to live. They receive me as a family member because we share a language - -and I can understand what they tell me. In their eyes I'm an equal, even though I belong to a different faith. This is the daughter of my son. I love her very much, as she is my first grandchild. There's a picture of it ... It must be in the conclusion or the introduction. Look, the 'insert' key. My grandparents didn't have the opportunity to get an education - - so they're illiterate. Everything is run by computers these days. In Iran you can also get your Koran lessons through the computer. I'm fascinated by the fact that you can get any information by pressing a key. 1 would like to study computer engineering. Computers contain a wondrous world. I can see that dreams are the same everywhere. No Entry for Men Isn't it a little loose? My mother was 14, when she married. She was very young. As she was so young, she says that I don't have to marry that early. There's no place like a father's home. You cannot enter the Mosque, if you're not wearing your chador. They won't let you in without a chador. This chador feels inhumanly heavy - - compared to the one I wore with such ease in my childhood. - compared to the one I wore with such ease in my childhood. Look! Once again I'm part of it all. In the holiest of cities, I enter the holiest of places: the mosque. Here I see the men dressed in black that I used to fear so. I witness the ritual, that 've felt uneasy about since childhood. |listen closely to the words. It's a prayer to the Holy Zeynab. She was captured 1400 years ago - - and humiliated by having to walk all the way to Damascus unveiled. Her humiliation is still bewailed. Every Friday they come here to grieve. Through sensing the suffering of this holy woman - - the men unburden their hearts with real tears. All religions have rituals of such intensity - - that they instil fear in the unconsecrated. I can understand the words, the chanting of the men - - but the ritual still makes me ill at ease. I come from an entirely different world. How can these two worlds reconcile? Or simply meet? I'm a Shia-Muslim - -but that is because of my parents. - But you do believe in God? - Yes, I believe. I love Ged, but I don't understand why the rules only apply to women. I always wondered about our Islamic laws. If a woman cheats on her husband with another man - - our Islamic state may stone her. But a man may have five legal wives and forty temporary marriages. Why? What kind of law is this? The man is worth more than a woman. Why? This law should be changed. It's out of date - - and not appropriate for present times - - with half the workforce in Iran being women. Did God create me, a woman, just to make me suffer? I always pray: "Holy Masume, you are a woman who knows a woman's pain.” Do we not have the right to live? Should we not have a life? Isn't it all just suffering? I care very much for the people here. Their stories fill me with grief. I feel like one of them and like a stranger at one and the same time. When you lived here, you were privileged. You could choose when to act like a Persian, and when to be Western. Does anything tie us together? Do we have anything in common? You, from a wealthy Western home and with a Western schooling. And me from a religious, traditional home and an Islamic schooling. It must be our sense of justice, that tie us together. Yes, we have our wish for justice in common. Yes, we have our wish for justice in common. But the freedom to make our own choices in life - - that is a privilege that sets us apart from each other. Now I'm leaving. But in my mind, I will never leave this land and these people.
