In 1996, after 18 months of war and tens of thousands killed, the Russian army pulls out of Chechnya. Peace will only last for three years. August 9, 1999, in an agonized Russia, president Yeltsin appoints an unknown man as minister of foreign affairs, Vladimir Putin. Three weeks later, unclaimed attacks shake Moscow. an unknown man as minister of foreign affairs, Vladimir Putin. Three weeks later, unclaimed attacks shake Moscow. The authorities attributes them to Chechen separatists. Some days later, the Russian army goes into action. Officially named "anti-terrorist operation", the second Chechen war starts. Damn... What is this shit, damn?! I don't understand it. Damn, why doesn't it work? Why doesn't it work. What the shit... Damn. So... Welcome. Welcome to the most fucking country... Chechnya! Well, there's not much happening because... we arrive a little after the battle. But I'll try to find people. You should have served, but you can see the state of the country, damn. Hi guys! Ah there. There's something. We will get closer. And so as I said. Welcome to the crappiest place... in the world! Where you don't want to be and you don't want to be seen. Hi guys! Anyway... you will never see what's happening here. because our beloved President will do... for all that we found peace here. And we don't care for peace... so we make war. Long live Great Russia and its brave army! Hurray, hurray, hurray, damn! So here you will see a live interview. As if you were there. Comrades arrested Cobra terrorists. Obviously terrorists. This is a dangerous mission. Hi guys! Hi! What do you want? - What I want? - Yes! I want to go home. Shit! Live. Kiss. Drink. Shit! What are you filming? Nothing. The war. The war? So come here. Come here. Everything here is real. We will show him war. - You'll see. - I'm watching! There. They just arrested terrorists. Elite Chechen separatists. The elite, shit! - What do you think? - He has a good head, shit. - Don't touch me! - We're good people! You are cowards. You're shouting at women. What? Oh. Horrible! I had to hit the balls. Right, you're snipers? Or not? - You're welcome... - I said don't touch! - I'm begging you! - Shut up, bitch! My son. Do you have a family as well? Hey guys, look. He's praying! Look. Shit. He's praying! - Are you kidding me? - You are terrorists! Shut up! - Are you kidding me? - Rebel motherfuckers! Is he mad or what? Calm the fuck! What the hell are you doing? He makes his prayer, that's what he did! No, what are you doing! You're praying? You're praying to your God, shit? Go ahead, go ahead! There damn, it's me you're going to pray to! Shut up! - I told you to shut up! - Come on, come on. Shoot! - Stop! - Shoot! Two! You are murderers! You are murderers! Shut up! Mom! Mom! There then.

Shut up, bitch! And, that's the end of the fucking! You are murderers! Go see. No! No, please! I'm begging you, no! All is well. There's nobody. There is a Chechen proverb: "When a bear decides to eat her baby, before killing it, "She dips it into the mud." That's what they did. They said we were spies, terrorists. They took everything we had on us. Papers, money, gold, jewelry... Then they ordered us to follow them. I understood that it was the end for us. Noura headed towards them and she begged: "Boys, what are you doing? "Don't you have a mother? "What do you want?" "This is what we want!" shouted one of them. And they started shooting. I saw Larissa's head break. Then I felt a bullet enter my body... and I lost consciousness. When I woke up... I had a terrible pain in my feet. It smelled smoke and gas. We were under burning mattresses. I crawled into a cellar. Old Russian women who lived there, took me with them. They took care of me. They saved my life. There were still people in our neighborhood... I don't know what happened to them. But I fear the worst... because of "SOBR", the unit of the Russian army... which controls the entire area around the "54" school. It's them... It's them who have killed us. Noura... Larissa... Me. Nazran, Republic of Ingushetia, Russian federation. 35 km from the Chechen border. - Hello! - Hi! Carole, your mother called four times this morning. I promised her you'll call back. Okay, thank you. I'm fine. How are you? Yes, I was told but I was not in the office this morning Yes I'm fine, don't worry. No, I forgot to call her back, I've a lot of work. Yes I know, listen Mom, it's just the New Year's eve. Okay, I'll call her. Yes, kisses. You told him what? That if she wanted to date me... she had to kiss his girlfriend. That's rock'n'roll. And she said what? Nothing. But you really said that? Of course not, are you stupid or what? I'll have a Coke. Primed one? No, thank you. Here. I'll be quick. Go ahead. Hello! I want a Coke. Hello. Do you have papers? Just a second... So... Is it yours? No. It's not mine. - Don't lie to me! - I swear. Lift up your arms! Empty your pockets. The second! That's not yours either? That's mine. Well, perfect. You're coming with us. And chocolate. Gvozdiov Nicolai! You know what you're risking? No. How old are you? Nineteen. You're too young to go to prison. You have nothing against the army? No. You know what? Wait in the hallway. I'll see what I can do for you. Thank you. Hadji! Vakha! Hadji! Allah is great and powerful. Lord have mercy on my father and my mother. Grant them Paradise. Let my brothers be alive. Give me the strength to find them. Hey little guy! Where're you going? What's your name? You're from what village? Where are your parents? Well, are you done bargaining? What are you playing at? Let the kid get in so we can go! Come quick, kid. We're leaving. Come. What's your name? Do you remember what happened? Do you understand what I'm saying? Did you lose your tongue? Don't bother, you can see he understands nothing. Poor kid... His parents must be dead. He'll never make it out of here. Okay, leave him alone. poor kid. Come on! Sir! Can we stay here? I am with my family, we don't know where to go. No, there's no more room here. But outside the city is a camp which is open. But where? We saw nothing on the road. Don't worry, we'll tell you where it is. But why are there people who can stay? Madam, there's no more room here. They only take the sick, or the children... who have no parents. This one isn't mine. We found him on the road. He's all alone. He's an orphan. Take him. Are you alone? He doesn't speak. Where are your parents? Mom. Papa. Where are they? He doesn't speak. I told you. Okay. Come with me. Well usually kids are taken in by the community. Those families have a clan system. There's a real sense of solidarity. It's very rare for kids to be left to fend for themselves, but in this kind of conflict anything can happen. Lots of kids get lost. And then, you never know why, there's a kid who makes it. Maybe he's a bit smarter, more resourceful or just luckier. But just imagine what ideas were put into their head. You mean we're creating future fighters? I don't know. I try to give them some sense of how things are in other places, but I'm very worried for them. I don't see how the Chechens can surrender. It's been going on for hundreds of years. It's just all horrifying. And if the international community doesn't stand up for them, I don't see a way out of this situation. I agree. What do you think is most urgent? What should the European Union be doing first? Everything is urgent. The people need everything. But I do know that for those here, knowing that the rest of the world hasn't completely forgotten them, is important. Sure. Thank you. Thank you. So what department of the EU do you work for? The Human Rights Committee. Oh really? That's wonderful. Well I don't know... - Thank you so much. - Goodbye. Are you alone? Do you know where your parents are? Where are your Mommy and Daddy? Are they there? Are they somewhere else? You know what? It's okay, honey. It's okay. It doesn't matter if you don't want to say anything. You're probably right anyway. Is this your sweater? Looks too small! Is it your brother's or sister's? Where... where is your brother? Do you know where he is? It's okay sweetheart. Take him in the other room. Hey, what are you doing? Who are you? What are you doing? Give me the bread! Give me the bread! Asshole. Asshole. Damn, the pants, shit! What's so funny? Shut up! Where do you come from? I'm from Novosibirsk. And you? Yekaterinburg. Perm. You couldn't escape? What are we talking about? What did you say? Fuck. What you doing here, band of assholes? I... we... Shut up! Clear! Join the others! Move your asses! You want some? I you want I split it. Here, for you. Don't worry, I won't bite you. Where are your parents? Nobody's looking after you? Take it. You want it all? I give you all. Don't worry, I'll buy more. Okay. I put it here, okay? Do what you want. You wanna come? Come on. We'll find you something, okay? My name is Carole. Carole. And you? What's your name? I'm Carole, and you? If you don't tell me your name, I'll call you... Francois. Your name is not Francois. I assure you, you won't like it. Never mind. Don't pull a face, you're my guest. You're not a prisoner. Look. You can leave if you want. It's open. Closed. Open. You can do what what you want. If you want to leave, leave. Okay, we have fun. Go, go. Move your ass! Move! Move! Quick! Quick! Band of fags! You, big! And you come with me! This asshole was shot. We must put him with the others and note on the form he died here. In combat. What happened? I am a fuck what happened. But... he didn't die in battle. Listen. Don't piss me off. You do what you're told. Move your ass. Yes, chief. Fast. Faster! The stretcher on the table. First you put him in the bag. Undress him! And then into the box. In short, this is how it's done. We will pretend he came here with his friends. You make a form. Here, as for others. You just put "Died in battle?" Yes. Is that a problem? No no... It seems you got a problem? No, sir. So it's no problem asking you to write that homosexual died in combat... and make him a hero? - No. sir. - Good. Because here that's the procedure. It's better for everyone. We frankly don't care, but it's for his parents. It would do them no good to know... their son was shot for being homosexual. This is important. You understand? Yes, sir. You sure you understand? Yes. That's good. Well, that's it. You got a new job. We must leave here, Raïssa. We can't stay. You know what'll happen... Is the girl here? Yes. Raïssa... they say they found a baby in Assinovskaya. This could be your brother. Get ready. Muhammad will take you. Thank you. - Live happy. - May Allah make you happy. Safe journey. Be free. May Allah show you the way. Do you like music? Come on. Let's go. Don't worry, you'll be fine. You'll make friends. At your age it's easy. Shall we go? Yeah, I know, I don't have another solution. You're from what village? You're Chechen? What's your name? Poor thing... You don't know anything about him? Not even his name? I was sure you go out together! You make a good team. Hey boy! Come back here! What are you doing? Come. Vakha! Thank you. He has been good. It went well with him. Muhammad told us what happened to you. What are you going to do? You can't stay here, the soldiers will return. I have another brother and I have to find him. His name is Hadji. Adam! Have you seen this boy? No. Apparently he went with a family. Everyone is leaving now. Someone must have taken him with them. I don't know... There was no one in the village. Maybe he's on the road. I can't leave you here, alone with the baby. Come with us. I can't leave. If he's here, somewhere... God knows where he is. How old is he? Nine years. Listen, you're making a mistake. If you change your mind, we're leaving at dawn tomorrow. You're lucky your family leaves you alone. Sorry, I said something stupid. I apologize. There's nothing much to eat, we'll shop tomorrow. Okay? Hey, shit! The colonel wants to see you. Yes, chef. Come on, hurry! Who do you think you are? Take your hands off! What do you got? When you are a real soldier, you can put your hands in your pockets, little fag. Enter! Kolya... Gvozdiov Nicola. At your service, sir! I heard that you wanted out of here. You made a request to leave. You got a problem? No, sir. You've complained to the hierarchy... because of the other bastard who committed suicide. Why? Was he a friend of yours? No, sir. So you're completely stupid. In the army it doesn't work like that. Here it's a family... We are together! And together we help each other! That's why... I meant that... So you want to fight? I don't know, sir. If you want to leave it's because you want to fight. Yes I want to. You think you are? For a hero, right? You think that here we're stashed? Right? Well, right? You think you have the right to ask for anything? You think you're in a position? You're a personal friend of the President perhaps? No, but I... Shut your fucking mouth! You're chatty too! Shut up! You're full of shit! I get it! Please! You little prick! Fuck your mother! Please! Homosexual! So? You're full of shit, asshole? You see you're full of shit? You stink of shit! So where's our hero, huh? Where is he? I get it! I get it! So you wanted to fight! Get out of here, homosexual! Go suck cock! Get out! So it went well? You stay with us or not? What? We know... Asshole! It's known that you're a Libra! Hello. Have you see a little boy of nine years old? This is his photo. Thank you. Where are they? Where are they? Did they move back? Go into the cellar! They advanced! They are just there! Where, right there? They're arriving from two sides. There! This is not good. I hope they won't break my windows. No, they're hard to replace. That's true. It's okay. You can use plastic. No, but these Russians don't know how to aim, since they are here! You sure it's your biggest problem? What's happening? They are moving now! They're all over the place! And what's happening then? We're leaving, leaving the village! Take the minimum of things! Tell everyone! Quick! Get up, we're leaving! Take the covers! They're coming! We're leaving in three minutes! Zukhra, you got something to take with you? Yes, my papers. Where are they? I'll go get them. In the cabinet with the mirror at the entrance. I'm on it. Quick, quick, quick! What are you doing? Come on, hurry up! What happened to you? Come on, hurry up. Let's go! Zukhra! I'll go get your papers. Go ahead! I'll join you! Take them all! Take all my papers! Hurry! Did someone see Rouslan? Where is he? Rouslan! - Did you see Rouslan? - No, we didn't see him. Come on, get out of here! That truck there is leaving! Climb up there! Up there! Come on, get up! And what will you do? We'll wait for Magomed. Get up. Give me the little one. Don't worry about us, go! Give me the baby! Come on, get up. Come on! What else do they need? I... I can't believe it! But she wasn't alone! There were representatives! Committee members! It... Oh great... But if it's the Russians who decide, then our work is pointless. Yeah I know. You're right. Yes... Goodbye. The UN representative is going to make a statement. She's refusing to regard this situation as a humanitarian disaster. Come and eat. It's ready. Come on. Come eat, it's ready. You have to come eat when I call you. Okay, enjoy. I know you'll eat when I'm gone. Let's just eat together. Come on, please. Hi. Oh hi. How are you? Erm... good! Are you busy? I have a little problem... I'd like to talk to you about. Yes... no, no... We have to... Talk to me as we go... I've got a lot I have to do and I've to catch up on some sleep... Go ahead. I had a little boy at my place for the last few days. he must be 8 or 9... A boy you took in? Well actually he kinda forced me into it. He just... He decided to stay. That's good. That's wonderful. But I'm not sure it's a good idea. I'm not sure I can handle it. I don't know what to do with the boy. I'm not sure I can take care of him. And... In fact I work all day and... I don't have time. You see... I don't know. I feel he doesn't want to do anything. He's not interested in anything. What do you mean. "He's not interested in anything"? Well... I don't know... We don't really connect. Okay, I'm not really good with kids, but this one... He's not good enough for you, is that it? No no! That's not the point! it's just that I've a lot of work and... Then go back to your work and bring him to me! I tried but he ran away! He's not exactly an easy kid! Not an "easy kid"? Well then throw him into the street! Lock your door and forget about him! "Not easy"? Can you hear what you sound like? No I'm sorry. That's not what I meant! It all came out wrong. Sorry, I was very harsh but... what do you want me to say? I don't know. I... I just wanted to know what you thought, that's all. I think you would be more useful taking care of a child... who actually reached out to you. I mean I'm sure that everything you're doing here is great, but... if all it leads to is another resolution... like the one the UN just made... Wait a second! I work for the Human Rights Committee! And I can assure that we will have a completely different position! I'm almost sure of that! But no one cares! What? Human Rights Committee... defending human rights. What's that? It's not new! No one cares about your reports, it's just... paperwork! I don't understand why you're talking to me like that! I do what I can! What is this? A contest? Just because I don't take care of kids... doesn't mean my work is useless! I hope you're right. Now, I really have a lot of work. I'm sorry if I upset you. I was very rude. I'm sorry. But everything I said is exactly what I think. That's for me? Is it a present? Did you steal them or did you find them? Anyway, it's very pretty. You give me jewelry and I don't even know your name. Thank you. Little rascal. You're okay, you're comfortable. You're right You know what? In fact, let's screw her! We can manage together. She's looking down on us like we're shit. We'll show her, just look. First I'll get you a present. We'll buy stuff and have some fun. Shall we go? There... A house. with a door. And then, a little boy like you. A boy. Now you want to draw a bit? Go ahead. Why do you scribble like this? The house will disappear. You should go on with the drawing, like this. You make a woman... and then a man... See? Because if you scribble, there's nothing left. Here. But damn, what are you doing there? Asshole! Get your hands off the table! It's not nice. As this too is beautiful! You have to taste it. Eat, eat! Eat, eat, eat! Coat Carrot! Viewing carrot! Coat Carrot, you eat your family, right? Hand me a napkin! What are you looking at? Hand me a napkin! You hear me? Pass it to me! Thank you. You're welcome. You're not taking any shit, eh? No. That way it's clear. Well, that's it! We'll play the con! That's good, we'll have fun. Come on, we'll show you something. I'm sure you'll like it. Come. Come on! Take it, here we go. Come. That's it, that's it. You're done! Get up, bitch! You too. Come on... Fuck! - Come on! - Move your ass, asshole! Advance! Advance! Come on! Go forward! Stop!

Let's see if you're queer or not. What are we waiting for? Undress, guys. They don't understand. Handsome! Handsome! No, but look at him! He doesn't understand! Really, he doesn't! Well? Come on. Show us your ass. We know that you're a queer. I'm not your maid! Look at your girlfriend, she undresses and you don't. What, you didn't understand? I ask you if you didn't understand? We won't spend all day! Go! Go! Go! Quick! We didn't want you to fuck! In hair. little whore! Damn, it's not clear? I order you to get the fuck naked! Undress! Hurry! I count to three. One... Two... Three. It's the end for you! In hair, hurry up! Brave guy, nice guy! Are you a freak! Brave guys! Dima! There's work! And well, here, you're happy. You're gonna go home. Your parents will be happy too. You haven't seen them since when? Six months? One year? I hope you wrote them at least. You could smile. At least, you're free. Because the other there... When they bury one leg... It'll make them funny. Funny at last... It's not funny. There's nothing funny, actually. Huh? Are you alone? You talk to yourself. I don't know. Well yes and no. And well, damn... Don't you make shit. Want some? You want? Yes? Here. And a beer? Yes? Good. Quick! Come on! Come on quickly, whore! Quick! Quick! Quick, damn! Come. I'll show you something! Come! Come on, follow me. Quick quick! Thank you! You're welcome. Want one? Yes. Here. Thank you. Fuck! We'll do it again. - Yes? - Yes. If the foreign minister doesn't read the file, it'll just be a file. It has no interest. Yes. It'll stay news for a week, and will be raplaced by something else. Listen mom, I'll call you back. Yes, I'll call you back, okay? This is a mare and her foal. It's a mother horse and her baby. And this is a bear with her cub. Did you ever see a bear? If you saw one you say yes, if not you say no. Yes... No... Yes... No... Yes. Did you just talk? You talk! Yes. Unbelievable! We can have a chat. We can be friends. No. Yes, we can do a lot of things. - My name is Carole, Carole. - Carole. Carole. And what's your name? My name's Carole, and you? - Hadji. - Hadji? It's fantastic.You'll have a lot to tell. And what about your family name? Hadji...? Carole. - Yes, no. But... Okay. Hadji? - Carole. Well okay. Don't worry, no rush. I am looking for my brother. He's nine. He's a little boy. Ah, a child. Go there. May I see the picture? It's him. His name is Hadji. Hang on a second... Was this his? Yes. He's gone. He ran away. I'm sorry. I don't know where he is. How was he? Well I don't know. He wouldn't speak. But physically he was fine, he didn't seem injured. I can't let you just leave. Not with the baby... I'll get you a bed. And some food. Alright? Hey guys! What the fuck? Was that you who killed the dog? But damn, why did you kill it? It was our dog! You're idiots or what? It was a nice dog! Band of nerds, you won't eat the dog? A real band of nerds. Come with me! By the way... you can put your hands in your pockets. Enter! Nicolai Gvozdiov, at your orders, Colonel. You're going. How are you, sir? You're going. You're going to the front. Now. Go get your pack. Thank you, sir! I came back... and saw a man running down the street. His face covered in blood, torn shirt, a distraught look. He tore out his gray hair. and repeated: "Oh Allah, Allah, have pity, have pity..." Suddenly I understood it was Mussa, my uncle. I barely recognized him. He was a mild and pleasant man. His wife died a year after their wedding, 15 years ago. And he never remarried. He stayed alone with Maliqa, his daughter, whom he adored. He was running slowly, like a puppet, and murmured: "Maliqa. Maliqa, my little girl, my God, have pity..." His house was in ruins. My two brothers went after him. Me too. Repeating the name of his daughter, my uncle threw himself on the ruins. My mother took him in her arms and tried to calm him. My brothers and other men... started searching the ruins. The women were taken away from the place.. Maliqa's body was found half an hour later. She was crushed by a wall. She was dead. We took her to the mosque, with other corpses. In the courtyard, we heard the first helicopter returning. We all fled. We left. We left without taking anything. Nothing at all. My uncle wanted to stay to bury his daughter. When the Russians arrived, they caught him and tortured him. But nothing could make it worse than having lost his daughter. They gouged out his eyes. Now he went crazy. Because the last thing he saw were the Russian soldiers laughing. My mother says that's the reason why he went crazy. That the last image... he got before plunging into the dark. Do you have any news from the Foreign Affairs Committee? No I don't. I keep calling, I don't stop but so far it's impossible to get an answer. What's terrible is how people don't care. It's incredible. Even my family, the only thing they can talk about... is how to organize New Year's Eve. The countdown to year 2000 is all that matters. I know what I'm gonna do for New Year's Eve! Yeah? Yes, I'm going to my boyfriend's family. They take care of everything and they have a nice house. It'll be a great evening! That sounds good! We're having dinner with my husband and both families. I'm happy because we really need a break. I've bought a new dress but I didn't tell him yet. Me too! Actually I told him because I wouldn't be able to hide it. And I bought some French perfume too. Yes? So do you know what you're going to do? - Me? - Yeah. I'm going to my sister's. She's also having a party with her husband's family... and our family. That's great! Yes. It's incredible to experience something like this. It's crazy. Yeah, it's crazy! You tidied everything, that's great! You know what I'll do? We'll have our own party. Do you want to? First we'll change the music. What shall I put on? Do you know the BeeGees? No, it's not from your age. Are you coming? Come on, dance with me. You don't want to dance? I'm sure you can dance. You're not funny. You know... We shouldn't go to bed angry. Sleeping with an angry mind is very bad. It messes you up. Sorry, Hadji. I'll go! No no no! Wait! Wait! Wait... Get up! - What do you want me to do? - Just wait! Get up! You know I've been thinking, why don't we take you on here? You'd be a big help to us, you could help us with the children. You would be paid. Not much, but... I don't know. I don't even know if my brother is still alive. I understand. But you have to think about yourself, Raïssa. It's your life too. How did you learn to speak such good English? I wanted to go to America. And you still can, you know... There's no reason not to. You see that little one over there? He was always on his own. He had terrible skin problems. He was always flying into these awful rages. No one could calm him down, you could barely talk to him. Everyone thought he was a hopeless case. And then... one day, he started writing stories like crazy. He couldn't stop writing. And then like a miracle... he started to get better. You know why? Because... little by little, telling these stories, he really began to tell his own story. He shared it. And that's how he found his place within the group. He started to find himself again, despite everything that's happened to him. That's really my job. Try to get them to understand that... despite everything that happened to them, they are alive! And they have a right to a better life. And that's what I want you to help me to do. Okay? You think about it? Come on, motherfuckers! Move your asses! We cross the square. And we take position. Got it? Go for it, if it was me who stumbles you! Get moving, tarlouzes band! Forward, go! Go, get yourself fingers ass! Forward, go, go! Sales fags! Come on! Yuri! Yuri! Fuck! What you did you do to my son? Damn... Oh my God... What did I do...? Fucking asshole, what are you doing! - I killed someone... - I'm sick assholes! Poor con! But who sent me morons like you? Listen to me! You rebuke position. And you cover the right! Get it? - Yes! - Dark! Forward, forward, forward! Yes! I'll tell you something, pal. Why do you think they were there? By chance? Forgotten in their home? It is the Chechens who put them there! Chechens! Sometimes they send little girls packed with explosives. What you actually believe. There's no Chechen innocent! You have to understand that. Very quickly. No mercy with these black asses, believe me. In any case, an old man and a kid, it is very impressive... What a picture of hunting! Next time I'll do better. For me, it was like... a deflowering. A virginity! A virginity! This is the first time you kill someone? Yes. Yes? It's gonna be a lot of work, the Foreign Affairs Committee is here in the next week. I don't know. I'm really scared. - I'm afraid to be totally isolated. - No no. You have done a great job. But it's not an exam. It doesn't lead to anything it's just a well-written report with no consequences. It's all pointless. Yes of course, but it's not all up you! It's only a tiny part of the story. At least you'll convince people. For us it's incredible that the truth will be told. There's a woman over there. She keeps looking at me, I don't know what she wants. Them? Yes. Do you know them? No. She says you stole her necklace and ring! I know it's impossible, but she insists. She wants to know where you got them. I'm sorry... Tell her he really doesn't speak. He's an orphan. You think it's a reason to steal? You think it's an excuse? No. You're right. I'm just asking not to overwhelm him. That's all. You don't need to protect him. You don't help him. What will he do when you're all gone? You should not think about him. Well... I better go. Don't you want to come? Everyone's playing except you. Don't worry... If you want, you can come. Excuse me. There's someone here who wants to talk to you. A boy. My name is Hadji. Hadji Saaïev. I'm nine and a half. My father, my mother and my sister died. They were killed by Russian soldiers. I also have a little brother, Vakha. I should have taken care of him, but I couldn't manage. I'm too small. Maybe if he is still alive... he will forgive me. You have to talk about your life before the war. Your story doesn't start here. Were you living with your parents and brother and sister before the war? Yes. You have memories with your parents? Yes. I remember one day my parents invited people. They sang and danced, they were laughing... Everyone was looking at them... they danced very well. Especially my father. My sister and me were proud of them. I'm sure they were very proud of you too. I don't know. It was my father who heard the soldiers arrive. He told us to hide, but my sister wanted to stay with him and my mother. I did as my father said. I hid with my brother. And I heard the soldiers screaming at my parents. And then they killed them. Once they were gone, I fled with my brother. But I didn't know how to feed him. So I had to leave him in front of a house. But I know there were no Russians in the house... because first I listened for their voices. Later, on the road, people took me in their truck. They said I was lost... and that I couldn't live normally. But in truth, they know nothing, even if they are big. For example, they couldn't know that I would meet you. They couldn't know. You're right. Just because they are big, doesn't mean they know better than you. It's true that I abandoned my brother... and also that I stole jewelry, but that doesn't mean I'm bad. I stole jewelry so we're even. Because it's always you who gives me everything, and I nothing. I thought it was a good thing to do. That's why I stole them. Don't worry, Hadji. You were right. You know none of this is your fault, don't you? Yes. Anyway, she was a stupid woman, because eventually the Russians will get her jewelry. So it's better that you have them. Kolya! Come with us! Hi, my brother! Okay? You've changed, whore! What are you talking about? Guys, say hello to Kolya. This is my friend, my brother, damn! That's Vacia, Igor, Cerega! Kolya. Nice to meet you. Here. Are you okay? And you? How are you? And well there, there... It's Paradise! Look! Cheers! Wait for me, I'll be back soon. Don't worry. I won't bring you a present, you don't have to steal anything. - Okay? - Yes. The important thing is that you wait for me. And don't listen to sad music, okay? - Okay? - Yes. This you understood. I have to go now, I can't miss it. You think I'll manage? - Okay? - Yes. Great. Then I'll manage. It's me! I forgot my money. So I came back for the money. I wasn't behind the door, I didn't see you dance. You're okay? Okay, I'll be back soon. Good afternoon. Thank you for your attention. I've come to tell you about a conflict that is occurring right now, in the other side of Europe. In Chechnya. This war, planned long time in advance, began last September 5th... with the Russian aviation strikes on Chechen soil. Then with the invasion of the Russian troops on October 1st, 1999. This is clearly an armed conflict... and not an anti-terrorist operation... as claimed by the Russian authorities. Since mid-October Russian troops have advances towards the south... accompanying their progress with massive bombings... making no distinction what so ever between combatants... and civilian population. For example... last October 21st... a missile exploded in Grozny, killing more than 150 people in a mosque, a market and a maternity ward. Grozny is now systematically and massively bombed... massively bombed 24 hours a day, despite the presence of over 40,000 civilians. It seems there is no attempt to target these bombings. The only objective appear to be... destruction... destruction and death. No sure exit corridors were left available to civilians... wishing to leave the bombarded cities and villages. When they take possession of a place.... the Russian troops... widely pillage... and extort at will. Rape... and summary executions take place almost systematically. The Russian army is doing nothing more than sowing trauma... and creating a need of revenge... that won't go away for several generations... if Europe doesn't intervene quickly. At least to show the Chechen people... that the world hasn't forgotten about them. Finally the Russians seem to have mastered the war of information... unlike the first war of Chechen. Which means that President Yeltsin... and Prime Minister Putin... encounter zero opposition in their country. And so they have their hands totally free to act. We are now going to see why this war is indeed a war... and not a series of anti-terrorist operations. Come in! I am going. I'm sorry. I hope you're not disappointed. No. Don't worry. We all respect your decision. Good luck. You'll always be welcome here. Hadji? Come with me. You wanno go play there? I'm back in a minute. Go! I'm sorry for the other day. - I was a little... - No no... I was exhausted and I'm glad you're back. - It gives me a chance to apologize... - No really... You were right about a lot of things and.... I understand what you meant. I was thinking to much about myself. Actually I came to see you because I made an important decision. I decided to offer to be host family... for the little boy I told you about. And I wanna make the procedure official. Would you help me? Well... Where is he? He's in the courtyard, waiting for me. Okay. May we see him? Sure. Hadji! Hadji... What's wrong? Nothing. Hello Hadji. Do you have a car? Yes. Can you come with me? Why? I'll explain. Okay. Let him go. Go! Go! Raïssa! Hadji! Go! Go!! Go!! Damn... Damn, why doesn't it work? Why doesn't it work? What a con... There... Welcome. Welcome to a big country of shit, fuck... Chechnya, whore. Well, there he goes not much... because it happens a little after the battle. But I'll try to find people. Well, finally now you'll see a little... crappy mood in this country, damn. Ah. I see the world out there, we will be closer. Translated From French to English by Sina-Khorramdarreh. Editing and translating French dialog by Subransu.
