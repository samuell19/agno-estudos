I can't be late. You won't be. What? Nothing. I know you love me. I wanna control my destiny. And how do you envision achieving that? I'm going to work hard, harder than anyone else. And I'll graduate with honors and go to Harvard or Yale with a double major in political science and global economics. I wanna intern at the UN and one day be an ambassador to France. And why do you think Winston is a good fit for Pearl? A mixture of your strong academics and the individual attention you have for the girls makes you a wonderful fit as you would say. Well, Pearl is a magnificent girl. A 4.4 GPA, eights and nines on her ISEEs, an accomplished pianist, well-liked by her teachers, popular with her friends. What's your secret? Well, it takes a village. A stable home is paramount in creating Winston girls. If there's trouble in the house, there's very little we can do to overcome it. Oh, this way. Oh I'm telling. What, you think I'm gonna put up your whoring around? Would you calm down? Oh good, 'cause you don't want a whore, I'm unreal. Let it be. - Who was he? - A guy. Oh uh, you go with the internet guy, right? - I wasn't with that guy. - You fucked him! Now get away from... No, you fucked him, didn't ya? You fucked that British guy Simon too. I fucked 'em all because I need a man not a crazy drunk, emotional cripple. Mom, Anthony? No. No. Oh my God. Were they married? What? We're they married? Come on, Grandma. Let me help you up. Come on. That was a new trick. - Jack Wolf? - Yeah. It's Isaac Robbins. We met years ago when you were seeing Helen Rosen. Right. You were um, her pal, a lawyer. You sort of swept her off her feet. Yeah, it was mutual. I'm representing her estate. Her estate? She's dead. She was killed last night. I'm sorry, Jack. What do you mean killed, how was she killed? The funeral's Friday. Mountainview in Altadena, 10:00. I thought you'd wanna be there. Do you know I haven't seen her for many, many years. It's important that you be there. You have to eat something. That policeman asked if I was angry at my mother. I don't know what happened. They were fighting. And then Anthony shot Mom. And then he shot himself. She shoulda... She can't be gone. She can't be gone. It's not possible. I'm so sorry, Nana. I know. Fuck! What the hell are you doing? - You just pulled out. - You just come screaming - down the street. - You didn't even look. You have to look - before you pull out. - Could've killed somebody. Look what you did to my car. What I did to your car? What the fuck you did to my car? I, I didn't see you. I was upset... No one lived. I don't think I was focused. I wasn't concentrating here. No, it's my fault. I was speeding and I wasn't paying attention and then suddenly you were just there. Are you okay? Yeah. You're American? Obviously. So what were you upset about? My husband just left me and I think it's my fault. I mean, I know it's my fault. Oh. Helen. Oh, uh, Jack, Jack Wolf. I uh... Here. For insurance. Right. Well, you know, it's probably for the best. Your breakup. Oh! That's what they always say. Oh, I'm not so sure about that. Should I give you my number, - I mean, for the car? - Do you wanna, do you wanna have a drink? What, you think I need one? I know I do. Uh. I know, I, look I know you don't, you don't know me so I... No, I know, I mean, I don't know you but I can see you're kind. I don't belong here. I'm from LA. Me too. West Hollywood. Oh. I wanna go home. I'll take you. I will. We just met. How long were you and Michele together? Seven years. Do you think he knew you? No. You married? Mmm nnn. Divorced? Never married. But you've been in love? Uh... Yeah, once. What was she like? She was curious, smart, funny. She sounds sexy. Mmm hmm. Where is she? Um, she's uh, she's right here. Yeah, she's right here. Oh. Why aren't you dressed? I'm not going. What do you mean? Enough. You have to go! It's your daughter's funeral! I'm not going! You have to go, Nana! My daughter is dead. What difference does it make? You can't not go! Hi. You must be Pearl. I'm Isaac, Isaac Robbins. I'm an attorney and an old friend of your mother's. I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you. Well, I have a car waiting to take you to the service. Oh! This is all simply too much to bear. Did you know my mother a long time? Yes. I admired her. Did you know my dad? No. He died before I was born. I'll go get her. I hear it's pretty good. An old friend of yours. Hi, thought you'd never make it. Jack. You got a telephone here? Been a long time. Yeah. It has, um... Look, I appreciate the invitation but I don't understand. I couldn't say what I have to say over the phone and there was no time. Well, how much time do you need? I don't think so. It's authentic. How long have you had this? I just opened her safe deposit box yesterday. Yeah, but it's addressed to you. Helen trusted me. Does the girl know? Pearl. I want three. Three? Mmm hmm. My mom was one of three and I've always wanted a brother and a sister. You know, I don't think I could handle three. I mean, having one is tough enough. I think I'm gonna wander off. Wander off? Yeah. Meet you back here in an hour? Sure. Okay. Do you love it here? Thought I'd lost you. There's a problem with the order of death. What? Well, it's better if we discuss it in my office. I'm not coming to your office. This has got nothing to do with me. Look, I don't want you to be that girl's father. To be honest, I don't understand what Helen ever saw in you. And I wish to God I had never opened that letter. Do you get that? Mmm hmm. Okay. Helen left her entire estate to her killer. We can get around that. But his family might contest it and tie it up for years. Why? No, anger. What are they angry about? I don't know, maybe they feel guilty. They don't wanna accept responsibility. Times of tragedy, people scurry away like mice. Will you take the girl? What? She's your daughter. Helen never told me anything about this. For all I know she could be your daughter. I was not Helen's lover. Can you support Pearl? I haven't even met her. Do the math. Why would she choose you if it weren't true? I have no idea. Is that Helen's mother? Yeah. She doesn't look too good right now. Look , I would make a poor choice as guardian. You're some sort of artist, aren't you? Mmm. They weren't actually married. His family doesn't want that girl to see a penny. Well, surely Helen had money put away. You know, just in case. She was too smart not to. I have no idea. You were her lawyer. She was in love and he was a very wealthy man. She was in love. Yeah, and he fucking killed her. I can't live with my nana. You should just live with us. My mom loves you. Oh God yes. We'd be like sisters. Do you really think it could happen? I'm positive. I love you, Pearl. I love you, Kate. Oh, it's okay. You don't have to... Like that. Hi, I'm... My name is Jack. I just wanted to come over and offer my condolences. Thanks, Jack. You knew my mom? Yeah. Yeah, I did, a long time ago. Well, it was nice of you to come. Um, yeah, sorry. Uh, thank you, thank you. So fucking weird. What? Do you wanna live with your grandmother? Because I'm concerned she can't take care of you. She can't. I wanna live with Kate Siegel and her parents. Do you think they would take you? Yes. They really care about me. Well, it's a huge responsibility. Did they tell you they would foster you? Not yet. I can't live with my grandmother. Fuck! Go away! What the fuck? Hi. Hi. Please come in. What do you do? Little of this, a little of that. Please. Filmmaker? Yes. Photographer? Yep. Painter? What do you want? What do you mean? Coffee, tea? You drink coffee? Do you have espresso? Yes. I'll have tea, Earl Gray. I have that. So what do you do here? Uh, mostly I write. What do you write? Um, films. Essays, journals. Do you sell anything? I have sold things from time to time but mostly I write for myself. Thanks. Are you my father? Why would you ask me that? You were dating my mother when she got pregnant. She didn't tell me she was pregnant. You're not sure, are you? What if you're my father? You could be my father. You don't want me to be your father. No. So what do you want? Kate Siegel is my best friend and her parents want to adopt me. Her dad's the head of a big talent agency. What, Marty Siegel? You know him? Um, he's one of the top agents in TV packaging in Los Angeles. It's what's best for me. Why? The Siegels know everyone. They go everywhere, stay at the very best places. They would protect me. This is how my mom would've raised me. So my thought is if you're my legal guardian, you could say I'm meant to be living with them. Does your grandmother know about this? She's not on board with this, is she? She wants you to live with her. I can't. You could take care of her. I love her but I can't. Did Robbins give you my address? Oh, and you thought it was better to just come here rather than call me first. You see the letter? He showed me a copy. And you still think I'm your father? Does it matter? You don't want a kid and I have somewhere to go. Wow. Practical girl. All you have to do is have a paternity test and claim me. And hand you over to the Siegels? I'm sure they'd be appreciative. Maybe he can help you find a job. What? Why shouldn't you benefit from helping me? Jesus, how old are you? Do this for my mom who you loved. Just sign this for me please. It says you're my guardian and you agree my life would be better if I lived with Sunny and Marty Siegel. This is what you want? This is what I want. I'm pretty sure I'm not your father. My grandmother's an alcoholic. Thank you. Pearl. Good luck. You too. I think I got a crush on you. I know. Oh, you're pretty cocky, aren't you? Oh. I can't believe you found that loser. It'll never hold up in court. My mom wanted him to be my guardian. He's my father and he gave his permission. He's not your father. It doesn't matter. Why? Because the Siegels don't want you. Yes, they do. I spoke to the mother, Bunny. Sunny. She loves me. They feel that you need special care right now. Given the exigencies of Martin's responsibilities at the agency, the household couldn't really withstand the changes that taking on another child, especially one with special needs would bring. You're lying. Call Kay. Yo, it's Kate. You know what to do. Please call me. Face it, kiddo. I'm all you got. Don't you lock your door? No. My grandmother poisoned their minds against me. Who? The Siegels? Marty Siegel? They don't want me. He's an asshole. No, he's not. Yeah. He's an asshole. Can I stay here? No. Just until I can reach Kate and straighten this out. No. You don't have to be my father. If I'm not your father, then I'm guilty of kidnapping a minor. No one would prosecute you. Your grandmother. Hey, Mr. Robbins. Pearl Rosen. Can you talk with my dad or the guy who might be my dad. I need to assure him he won't go to prison if I crash on his couch for a few days. Oh. I'm actually here right now. - Nope. - One second. I don't wanna talk to... Yeah. Yeah, but I'm not her father. Yeah, without my knowledge 15 years ago. Uh huh. Well, I'm still not gonna say that I'm her father. Yeah, you too. You have that old sports car, don't you? Come back here, you little thief! I know you took my money! I didn't take your money! - Help me! - It's my money. - I'm being robbed! - She seems upset. Police! Call you tomorrow, Nana. Go. Come back here with my child, you crook, you goddamn crook. I love you. What? Nothin'. I make you happy. Yeah. When will you know the results? I'm not sure. Next week maybe. Where are you gonna sleep? Downstairs on the couch. I sleep there often. It's fine. What's that? It's the mailbox. Mail comes through right in the house. It's, uh... old school. Pearl. This one's for you. Pearl. Hi. I'm Jack Wolf and this is Pearl and I was wondering if we could see Ms. Whetstone. Is she expecting you? We don't have an appointment but it's important. Sorry to barge in. No, no, please come in. Mr. Robbins called. And may I say how terribly sorry we all are for your loss. Thank you. How are you feeling, Pearl? I'm okay, thank you. You know, under the circumstances she's doing incredibly well. Mr. Robbins explained that you're her birth father. Yeah. I only recently came into Pearl's life. And you're here to discuss the letter. No, I wanted to tell you that there's no problem on paying the tuition, - full-time. - Mr. Wolf, it's not about money. But my grades, my community service. I'm going to be frank. Please. Despite our reputation for rigor, we want our girls to succeed. And Pearl has gone through an incredible trauma. We felt the Winston program would only add to her stress. Don't you think that's a question you should ask Pearl or her family? Honestly, we felt your plate was terribly full. I know how disappointing this must be for you, Pearl, but I sincerely believe that this is what's best for you at this time. Please. I am sorry. I don't think you are. Pearl. Can I come in? You need to ask before you open the door. Oh, I'm sorry. You busy? Yeah. Well, put a pin in your social media 'cause we need to talk. No, we don't. Yeah. I'm sorry about Winston. Go away! We need to talk about your school. Winston is my school. I've enrolled you into JB. What's that? John Burrows, it's a local public school. I'm not going to public school! Yeah, you are. You are going to public school at least for this term. You can't stop me! Winston is my school! I'm not going there! It's not your fucking school now, is it? God, I hate you! It shoulda been you that died! I know that you don't trust me. But it's the best I can do right now. It's gonna be okay. Why didn't you tell me about him? He had a father and a mother but they're all gone. She was pretty with red hair like mine. He looks like his dad with those ears. Are all those people related to me? My God, where did he get those ears? Do you want me to come in? No. Not even to say hi to the principal? All right, I'll pick you up after school. We live six blocks away. Go write or whatever you do. Okay. So library's over there. And then the science building's next to the parking lot. You can smoke there. I don't smoke. What are you lookin' at? You I guess. Don't be lookin' at me. Don't you ever be lookin' at me. I thought you were looking at me. Why would I be lookin' at you? I don't know. I didn't wanna be rude by looking away. You didn't wanna be rude. So you stare right at me? I'm Pearl. She's new. Are you here for the Special Ed program? Are you special? No, just trying to be friendly. Okay, we should go. You're an interesting girl, Perlita. So are you. Silvia. That's a beautiful name. Are you brave or just stupid? So how come a big-time Hollywood director wants to teach Film Directing One at an art school? I just wanted to teach. Uh huh. Why now? You know, I've been very fortunate so I thought it was time to give back. Uh huh. I talked to your agents, your former agents. They said that you're a pariah. Nobody wants to work with you. Why is that, Jack? Uh, 'cause I got a big mouth. Not proud of it. So the big shot gets his comeuppance, is that it? I'm not a big shot. I'm just good at what I do. Well, it's a basic course. It's not artsy. You ever teach before? We don't need an auteur. You know, you're thinking I don't have to teach for a living and that, you know, I'm betting if a slot opens up at "Gray's Anatomy", you'll be outta here like a shot. That is not true. You're here as a favor to Isaac Robbins. He's a decent man. He's never asked a favor of me in 15 years. I told him you probably wouldn't take the job and if you did, you'd be outta here in a month. When do I start? Hello? Need help? No, it's okay Maybe. His name is Zack and he's way old But I think he liked me. I don't know if he liked me that way but we made a connection. Is that too dumb to say? I don't know. Should I buy this? Yeah. And he gave me a record. Wow. How'd it go today? Kids okay? Yeah. Teachers? Homework? No. Wine? You're too young. For you. Ah. How did you um, how'd you learn to do all this? Oh yeah, she was, she was a great cook. When she was inspired. Yeah, well... I don't really believe in inspiration. I think that you get up every day and you go to work and you do the best that you can. Mmm. This is fucking fantastic. I got a job. When do you leave? I'm not going anywhere. It's here in LA. I'm teaching. What will you teach? Film directing. But dean already hates me. That didn't take long. Well, I didn't do anything. It's just... He hates who I am. Some people hate you for who you are and some people hate you for who they think you are. You're paranoid. Uh uh. He hates me. You know how I know? How? He told me. He told you he hates you? Uh huh. He hates every single thing about me. Why do you have a gun? Sometimes I just... Think about killing yourself. No. I got rid of it. When? When you moved in. Really? Yeah, really. Good. What's this? An invitation. Ah, Kate Siegel. That's good, yeah? Read it. Hmm, they want to invite me too. Her dad remembers you. Hmm. Will you take me? Yeah, sure. It's for Kate's party. What do you think? You look amazing. I have two others. Let's see 'em. Could be a bit longer, maybe. Just below the knee. I'm just sayin'. I haven't seen Kate in weeks. Since you died, people have avoided me. It's like I'm damaged. I have to show her I'm okay. I have to show all of them I'm doing well, that I'm strong. Pearl, Jack, smile. Awesome. All right, gimme your serious face. That's really good, right. - Yeah. - Yeah, awesome. Hey, go find Katie. She's over by the chocolate fountain. She's had her face tattooed by a gypsy woman. And gimme one more. Hey, buddy. Ah, Pearl looks great, huh? What are the odds you could be her dad? Yeah, what are the odds? How you doing, buddy? Fine, Marty. I'm changing. Yeah, yeah, I know, they called me. I told 'em you'd be a natural. I'm still a filmmaker, Marty. Yeah, of course you are, buddy. I mean, shit they bet a little bit on the last one, but just let it blow over. Disney's got a very short memory. Thanks, Marty. And it was Warners. Pearl? Oh my God, hi! You have to get your face painted. Harper, gimme the chair. Can you paint Kate on her arm? K-A-T-E. You okay? It's okay. Let's get outta here, come on. Uh... There's one that's like a thong but that doesn't seem right to me. Mini, maxi, wings. Eve, stop yelling. Yeah, I got it. It's 28, right? All right, it's got 36. Okay, great. Thank you, thank you. Did you get the right ones? - Yep. - You're sure. You called Nana? Yes. Just tell me you're okay. Listen, if you tell me you're okay, I'll leave you alone. Tell your father I said he's an idiot. I can hear you, Eve. She's 15 years old. Did you at least get her the pads? Yes. She's taking a bath. I know she's taking a bath. And no, I am not drunk. Why not? I'm eight days sober. Ah, you finally joined a program. Mazel tov. One day at a time. You never thought about her getting her period, did ya? Why would I? You're parenting a teenage girl. Asshole. Call me tomorrow. Thanks, Nana. And thanks for getting sober. Now, I'm choosing to believe that you're a strong person who will survive this because of your ultimate resilience. Did he do that with you? All right. Try to show his feelings through movies? I don't care about his movies or his lame attempts to teach me about life. His movies aren't real. I'm real. You can't see me. 4.4. Miss Rosen. Yes, sir. Am I boring you? No, sir. Your posture would imply otherwise. It's not you, sir, but the lesson. Too easy? Hmm. Jack spends half his weekly allowance on candy. To earn more money, his parents let him wash the car for $4. How much is the weekly allowance if he ended up with $11. $14. Please demonstrate. 96 students went on a field trip. Four buses were filled. Eight students took a car. How many students filled each bus? 22. Do you want me to demonstrate? Thank you, students. Have a nice day. Uh, Miss Rosen, one minute. Hey. Hey. What Filsoufi want? I hurt his feelings. What? He told me not to make him look foolish. What'd you say? I'm sorry, Mr. Filsoufi. You going home? Yeah. You live with your dad, huh? How did you know that? I googled you. Read about your ma. I bet she was a righteous bitch. She wasn't a bitch. No. You could tell she was a good ma. How can you tell? 'Cause you coulda turned out to be a snotty rich little ho but you ain't. That's your ma's doing. Yeah. She was a righteous bitch. They put you back? What do you mean? Like, when you transferred, they put you back a grade? No. Ah, so you a smarty. You're a smarty too, street smarty. Head down, chica. You're shitting me. $65 for a movie? My brother can get you anything for free. Pirating. No. He gets 'em for free. He steals them. Only rich people think like that. I'm not rich anymore. Hello. Hey, Perlita. This is my friend Silvia. That's Zack. Hey there. You got a girlfriend? Why do you ask? My friend thinks you're very handsome. No, I don't have a girlfriend. Boyfriend then? You could tell me, it's okay. How old are you? 16. Ah, sweet 16. You like young girls, Zack? You wanna take us out? We could get in trouble for flirting like this. Were we flirting? You know it's in French. Am I happy? Is your life everything you want it to be? You play the hand you're dealt. Come on. It's only an old man here. You're very wise, but your not 16. I'm a Scorpio. I ordered El Coyote if you're hungry. Thanks. Do you identify with the father? No, I don't think so. I hope not. And I'm just the ungrateful son who realizes I really do love you? Pearl, it's just a movie that I liked and I wanted to share it with you, that's it. Do you ever think of doing something with me that I wanna do? Could you just gimme a chance to like learn how to do this? What if my mom had chosen you? Would you be finding your way? Would you tell your child to give you a break? My mom just did it. She took care of everything. She was good at everything. She was smart and funny. She just knew what I needed. Yeah, 'cause she loved you. She didn't love me. Yes, she did. What makes you even say that? Because she left me to you. Yeah. I'm sorry. You can't even hold a job. Happy New Year. Why are you defending him? He's a monster. But he made you breakfast. Yeah, it's inedible. At least he's trying. Hey, bitch, hold up. That's my sister's phone. That's my phone. Give it to me. What are you doing - with my sister's phone? - That's my phone. Are you calling me a liar? No, I'm saying you're mistaken. That's my phone! That's my sister's phone, you little thief. Why are you doing this? You're gonna go to jail. What are you gonna do, huh? I'm gonna disable the phone, tell the police, and you're gonna go to jail for nothing because you're stupid. If you tell anyone, I'll kill you. Go ahead, kill me for a cell phone. Go ahead, kill me! You're going to prison! You all right? You're dead! Both of you are dead! Are you all right? Are you? You should've run. He took my phone. Your dad would buy you a new one. Back that shit up. We're good until 11:30. I've got Spanish. With Gutierrez? Yeah. Don't worry, I'll fix it. How can you fix it? I'm his teaching assistant. Don't worry, I got you. You sure he's at work. Your dad's won Academy Awards. Hardly. Those are from dinky little film festivals in Podunk towns. No, this one's from Germany. Belgium, a student festival. Why you diss your papi? He's a star. Who reads all the books? He studied literature. Your dad's into teddy bears? Those are mine. You got your own room? He gave me his. He sleeps downstairs. What do I gotta do to get adopted? Trust me, you do not want Jack Wolf as your father. Does he beat you? Hey. How was your day? Where's my charger? What? For my phone. I don't know. It was right here. How was school? I hate it. What, school, what happened? Nothing. Nothing happens there. It's just a place where hopeless people send their hopeless kids. Can you set the table please? I'm not hungry. You gotta eat. I'm not hungry. Come on, I went to John's on 3rd. Stuff is expensive. Gimme that fucking, that fucking... That's mine! Don't you dare raise your hand to me. I'll do what I want. You can't control me. I'm responsible for you now, you ungrateful little bitch. You can't, you can't. What are you doing here? Um, I was in the neighborhood. I thought I'd give you a ride. I have plans. Hi. I'm Silvia. Hi, Silvia. Jack Wolf. Sure I can't give you a ride? Sure. You know Pearl has told me what a great dad you are. Thank you. My pleasure. - Thank you, Pearl. - See you tomorrow. Bye, Silvia. Listen, I know you miss her. You don't know anything! Pearl. You can't fix it. I know I can't. Stop it, just stop! - Get out! - What? Just easy. I'm surprised you're awake. I'm exhausted. I need to sleep. That's it? That's all you got to say? Where were you? I was out listening to music. Oh yeah? You have fun? Yeah. Who's the guy? There was no guy. The guy who drove you home. He was just a guy who drove me home. What am I supposed to think? You're not supposed to think anything because it's my life. Look, I worry about you because I love you. No, you don't. No, you don't love me because if you love me, you'd want me to do whatever I wanna do to be happy. This is my house. Your house? Yes, my house. You know what? It's your house. Seriously? Just calm down, Helen, okay? - That one's like you. - Man, if had more money, I'd buy the Chanel bag I want. If I had that bag, I'd be truly happy. That's all you need to be happy? Well, if your dad had more money, you'd be at Winston. You'd have all the shoes and the tops and the Chanel bag too. That wouldn't make me happy. Well, it would make me happy 'cause I'd have a rich friend. But I wouldn't know you. Oh shit. No, wouldn't bring your ma back. But it would ease the pain. Yeah? You decent? No. What you up to? Homework. Hi, Mr. Wolf. Hey, Silvia. Hey, you think it might be possible to gimme a ride to the bus? We'll give you a ride home. That's really considerate, Mr. W, but I can take the bus. We'll take you. Thanks. Get your stuff together. Come on. Thanks. You're welcome. Can Silvia stay over, Dad? Ah, it's a school night, honey. Plus I think Silvia's parents would like to get a glimpse of her. My ma's working two shifts. She's a nurse, trauma unit at USC. Wow, that's intense work, yeah? Very. You know, I think you two need a break. Come on, we'll be so good and we study so well together. Your dad is right, chica. I gotta check in on my little sisters anyway. Catch you. Thanks for the ride, Mr. Wolf. No problem. Hey. I just wanted to spend a little time with you. I finally make a friend. You're right. Go get her. Hey, where are you? In my room. Come outside. My dad said you can stay. Another time, chica. Really? You were just up for it. Go home. I'll call you later. You're sure. Yeah, go. Okay. Stop here. What's up? I'm gonna get something. Do you want me to park? It's okay, I'll walk. Thanks. Okay. Hey. Hey, sorry, we're closing up. Can you gimme a ride? I thought you lived nearby. I'm not going home. Where you going? Where are you going? I'm headed home. Where's that? Silver Lake. Me too. Seriously? Seriously. Geez! My turn? Oh! The other way. That's where I live. Can I come in? I don't think so. I want you to be my first. That's a big responsibility and I'm not up for it. But you care for me. I know I'm too young for you. You're not too young to be my friend Do boys even want that? My dad says all they want is... You should listen to your dad. He's not really my dad. My mom says a good man is better than none. It's stupid. All right, I'll go. But you have to kiss me. Perlita. One real kiss. You're not 16 are you? I am. Don't ever leave. Not like that. Did you propose? She didn't wanna marry me. So she said no. Um... She just made it clear that she didn't wanna get married. God, you're such a loser. Hey, if you could live anywhere, where would it be? Honestly, my dream is my old life. I had everything but mostly I had a mother who loved me. And your friends? I had great friends. Well, where are they now? I think they feel I left them. You had no choice. You always have a choice. Did your mom have a choice? That's different. What's your dream? I want your life. My old life? Your life. My life? Get up on Saturday morning, put on my expensive clothes. My mom and I will go to Rodeo Drive to shop. We'd have a credit card like one of those heavy gold ones. No, platinum. The AMEX platinum card. And then we'd just go from store to store and buy whatever we want. And then we'd go to a fancy French cafe and get one of those colored macaroons. You know, for like $20 for a tiny cookie. I want your life. Now. Is it normal? How late are you? It's been five weeks. Well, that's pretty long. But, you know, it's not unusual for someone your age. Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. Call me. Can I help ya? Is Silvia here? There's no Silvia here. Silvia Lopez doesn't live here? My name is Harold Arbett and I own this house and there's no Silvia here. I'm so sorry. Perlita. Where do you live? Where are you? I'm at what I thought was your house, the house we drop you off at. What do you want, chica? I came to see you. I needed my friend. Go around the corner. Can I come in? What do you want? I don't care about your house. I'm not your sister. I'm sorry I didn't call. What do you want? I wanna run away. Go home, chica. Wow, I thought you'd understand. Because I have real problems? My mother was shotgunned to death. Doesn't that qualify as a real problem? How long you gonna play that? Your whole life? You're here for what? A year? Then you'll go back to your private school and everything returns to normal. You just be the unfortunate girl everyone there feels sorry for. I thought we were friends. Look at my house, chica. That the house of your friend? I don't care about your house. Yeah, you don't care 'cause it's not yours. - That's not what I meant... - No, I know what you mean. You don't care 'cause you think your life is so fucked up 'cause you don't live in Beverly Hills no more and you gotta live in a fairy tale wonderland that your daddy made for you and you think it's shit. You don't care 'cause you're just a spoiled little bitch. Go on. Get outta here. Would you have married her? Yes. You're sure? Even if she was pregnant? 100%. If you say so. I was crazy about her. I thought she felt the same way. I thought that she loved me. So why did she end it? I don't know. I don't, I don't know. I'm pregnant. Are you sure? Have you seen a doctor? No, but I've taken a test. Two. You tell anyone? You didn't tell your grandmother? She'll think I'm an idiot. How far along is... Seven weeks and a day. How could you be so sure? I'm sure. I can't have a baby. We'll work this out. Look at me. We'll get through this together. Pearl? Can we go see my mom? Sure. I'm afraid. What are you afraid of? I'm afraid I'll forget. That's not gonna happen. Pearl. It's not gonna happen. No one will ever love me that way again. She loved you too. Ultimately, I think we were just friends. It was more than that, Jack. I loved you. Even when love is right there with you, it's hard to believe you're worthy of it. I thought I had lost you. You will never lose me. But I thought you were in heaven. I am, honey. It's right here. Why did you leave me alone? I left you with your father. Is he my father? Did you get the results? I love you.
