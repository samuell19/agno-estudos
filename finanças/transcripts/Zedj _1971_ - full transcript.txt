God bless you, to come from season work great profit, God bless you. God bless you, to come from season work great profit, God bless you. Good afternoon, comrade president. - Good afternoon. What should I say to your uncle? - Uncle will come soon. Go away Katherine, your brother will ger angry. And you? You're here, how are you? - Fine, good afternoon. THIRST Why did you come again? - I came to see you. I don't want to see you again. Go to Mara Jovanoska, her husband left before others. No! No, Ignjat. No! Son! I want a son! Come, don't be afraid. Uncle's gold. Dear, don't be scared of me. When uncle from America comes here, he will bring us golden grains. Oh, my beautiful! They gave me this for Nikolina. Easy children, one by one! - Calm down you rascals, calm down! There's plenty for everyone! Get away from here already! Get away! Do you understand me? In order! Get in line! Everybody, get in line! Here, new thing for your collection. I'm only sorry for my breasts. When I was on the street I was wearing 300 of them. You're thirsty? - It's for you. For me? - I'll take it. What does it say? Abominations. 'Keep my red box safe. Your Mile.' Idiot. He's a funny guy, he thinks he patented you. Leave him. - He's in the army. I will when he returns. And who will recognize your humanity? No one. Us women get hurt only because of humanity. I knew one guy like that once. 'My love, my love, my love...' He was very persistent, so in the en I thought, why not? What is it darlings? You're still shy? C'est la vie! Then he insisted to get married. I didn't like him. I can't accuse myself too hard, darling. I though about it, conclusion was quite logic: Why should make two blind people out of one? When I remember... When he saw what he will see. That's the first wedding night, honey. Enough with that 'experiences' of yours! Why did you came Kate? I came to visit my mother's grave. When you dream you mother, something nice will happen to you! - Are you lying to me, grandpa? You'll see, Kato. God will give us, it will rain here. It would be so nice, if we could have just a little rain. Only a few drops, grandpa. - God will give us that, Katice. You dreamt a nice dream! Kate, come to the elders and I'll make you a wreath. Only priest can put a wreath on me. You can't run away from destiny, Kate. - But I... I'm in a hurry, grandpa. You be in a hurry, but be sure that you'll arrive! And the doors, grandpa? - Why the doors, Kate? That is only for dogs. And we're people. Soul is just flying and flying. Soul is flying... Soul is flying... Teacher, this friends is from the city, an engineer. I'm Viktor. - Marija. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. I wanted to ask you, I need a water carrier. Who can help me with that? With comrade director. I've brought a fresh bred, like a soul! - Allow me. Follow me. I heard we have uranium here. I didn't know that. Do you even know what is uranium? - No, but I can live without it! Is there any mail? - No, there isn't. How's the water situation? - Bad, is disappearing. I am geologist, my people will arrive tomorrow. We're gonna do geological researches up in the mountain. Water will be a problem. Comrade Ignjat has sent us to you, to arrange that with your water carrier. We don't mind that at all. - Thank you. We'll have a chance to talk these days. Of course. Our girls and neighbours like company of smart people very much. These days, of course. Now, goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. This is a pestle, and this is a stamen. Like we said, children, one of the most important factors for prolongation and keeping one species in the world of the living creatures, is impregnation. What is it, Jevdokija? - I want to come in. What took you so long? - I was helping my mom, my brother is sick. Quietly, quietly, come on in. Pay attention children. So these are male cells, and this is a female cell. My brother is sick. - Alright, sit down. Impregnation is happening in that way, that the pollen is transported from male to female cells. And now, how can pollen be transported? With the wind! - Yes, on of the ways of transportation is the wind. And another way? With fleas, horses, sheep and peoples. - Or calling all that with one word? Yes, or transportation of the pollen by? - Touch! You say that there's something in this desert? Yes, ore. Of uranium. - Then we'll live nicely here. I hope our children will come back from abroad. There! There they come. They?re coming! Can you see well from this distance? One, Two, three, Four, five, six of them! - Let me see! Exactly six of them. - We didn't offend God in any way, let me see them. Such beautiful men! Who is the most beautiful? Lord, bring them here as soon as possible. Do you want to see? He's so pretty... Very pretty! He's very pretty. - Until the city boys arrive here, our muchachos will be good. Good afternoon, Kato. - Good afternoon. Are the teachers here? - Yes father, Jelica is waiting for you. - God bless you! Good afternoon colleagues. - Good afternoon. It's for you Jelce. - Thank you dear. - Nikolina, one for you too. Thank you, father. - Marija, flower for you too. Miss, are we ready yet? - Don't you have to perform a service? One funeral, half an hour. Half an hour of work. There's a lot funerals these days, father. - That's all from God, Jelica, honey. Come on girls! - Let's go. Hurry up! For who are all these nuts? - Uncle will arrive from America. That's too much, Kato. What will he do with all those nuts? Goodbye, Kato. - Goodbye, father. Here's the water, let's drink! What are you doing here? How many times have I told you not to drink water from here? They're thirsty, poor kids. - I know, I'm afraid they'll get sick from it. That's all from God. - You were boring enough, what God... If God almighty would give us some rain. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. He's a devil. - He's a womanizer, to hell with his beard! This country will fail because of people like him. Look at them waiting patiently. Ready? - As always, Jelce. Next saturday, amigos! Your wishes senoritas? - Schnapps as usual! - Oh, a schnapps! Well why not? - What will kind sir take? - Orange juice, muchachos. Others kind ones liked to... - Throat muchachos, I have to save my voice! Then six schnapps?s and one orange juice. And salad? - Sure! - One boiled egg? - No need to ask, bring everything! Dad is coming, let's run! Brother, daughter-in-law can give birth any minute, and you're hunting. Be quiet! Get out of my sight! You're on my back my whole life! What are you waiting for? Hunters from the city will be here any moment. Hater! God, why can't a strong wind blow from the sea so uncle can come faster. To save myself, so I can see the day! My golden uncle, I'm waiting for you with my whole soul. Come faster, come. Cheers! - Cheers! Jelce, honey, slow down a bit. - If you need a holy woman, go to church, father! Mother of God, Jelce, honey. - Leave me alone, holy one. I'll go away some day, you'll see. Some where far away, far away. Caballero, tell us what was like there, in that world far away. Rio de Janeiro, senorita! Samba, Samba! For all day and all night, senoritas. Nights, and days, you don't have to blink! For ours senoritas! Cheers! I'm wasted, I'm already drunk. Why don't we have some young man so I can show him how to dance? Greetings, muchachos! More food and drink for everyone! Come on, patron! - Right away, Ignjat! Jelce, honey... - Come on, dance. I will take you to the city. You'll get an apartment from my company. I had thousands of apartments like that. I was on the sea, on the lake, on the mountain. What can I say, a real luxury. I was in other countries too, for example France, Italy, Spain... One prince proposed to me. Never mind! Sister likes living, and liberty! What is it? - Jelce, honey. - What? Can't you see this devil is lying to you? Come on, let's get out of here. Let me go! Where? And you little one, why are you lonely? - Leave her alone, she's not for you yet. Then you'll be for me. In front of the eyes it could be them. Mind is playing tricks on them. Killers. My beautiful Whitey! My beautiful! Katica! - Yes, grandpa... My woman caught me with some magic, too. Go and be at service to Ignjat's wife, she's in labor. Don't behave like that, teacher. A human is being born there. Is it dead? - It's a girl, brother. You whore! Don't shoot the water, brother! No, don't shoot the water! I have another daughter. She'll wash my feet! Nikolina, what's with you? No, I won't allow it! Not, don't shoot the water! I won't allow it! Water! Let's pray to God with peace in our souls. Let's pray to God for world peace. Let's pray for this temple and for all those who are entering here with faith. You are merciful, and people loving our God... Mother of God, bring me my uncle, as soon as you can. I can't take this anymore, I want my home. Uncle will create a bride out of me, like my own father. You understand me mother, right? From small one to the great one... I fell in love with one girl... Time has come for me to take you. She asked for my offer. I went to see her, I found her on the stretcher. - He never sang better. Let's leave this place, darling. - Where? Everywhere is same for me now. There's no hope, no use. Damn priest! A coward! I'll find someone who will take me away from this village! Damn priest! Kato, it's all in vain. - What is it? Kato, pull yourself together, nothing can help now. Enough! Enough, enough! Crazy women, whores! You infected my house! I'll extinct all of you! Everyone! Wait a minute. Little soul has gone away, it's like she knew. Water... - Bring some. Jelce, Marija, uncle is coming! Jelce honey, uncle is coming! Change your clothes, dress up a little! Faster, he'll be here any minute! Poor Kate, her uncle has finally arrived. Let us go see that uncle from America. Wait, take the flags! Children, wait! Marija, let's go dress up! - Get in line, everyone follow me. Un-cle, un-cle! Come on, everyone! Uncle, I'm Katherine, I'm your Kate, uncle! Long live uncle! Uncle, these are our teachers. - Good afternoon. This is my Golden uncle! Come on children, let's everyone get in line. Thank you. Welcome, uncle. In God's name, forward. Welcome, Trendafil. We wish you good health. - And happiness. Uncle, come and see your room. Welcome, uncle. - With happiness and you. Thank you my dear. - What's it like there, Trendafil? Very rich life. Nice life, and everything is on time. Big industry, big towns. Many, many people... Is our mountain over there? - It's there. Come on Marija, begin. Quiet! Pay attention children, two, three: Please uncle, sit down. I'll tell you one dream of mine. I have it every night. With my late mother, we were collecting dry woods in the mountain. And in my heel, trough my shoe was a hawthorn thorn. My poor mather carried me on her arms. That thorn stayed in my foot, and I stayed in the mountain. I'm yelling: "Mother, mother!" She can't hear me, she's leaving. I'm still yelling: "Mother, mother!", and then I wake up. I can't sleep anymore, I'll go crazy. And so, here I am. I ran away. What did you uncle bring you? - The ship has to be unloaded first. And dollars? Did he bring that a lot? - A lot. You've never seen so much! You'd get scared! What will he do with all that money? He won't build a church, won't he? He'll build something... He will. But first, he says: Kate will be a bride. I swear on my brother. He said: Everything I have, I will spend on Kate the bride. I don't know why is he spending so much on me, I say: "It's too much uncle, too much that much is wrong, why so much on me?" "So it's known! So it can be remembered", he says. I swear on my brother! But I don't want that much, what will I do with all that? Ask from him you fool, ask from him! Marko! Where is that crazy water carrier? Be quiet! Quiet, it's enough. That's you, Marija. We're looking for that Marko everywhere. Come, I'll give you water. - Many people are burned from thirst, up on the mountain. Where is a water carrier? - It's not his fault, the last well had dried up. Come. I'll treat those burns you have, come. Come in. Hello. - Well, well, finally we see you here. I'm sorry, my hands are dirty... You're burned as if you were baked in an oven. Up there is hell. Just rocks and sun. What are you drawing? This is our rich American, returnee. He's an uncle of our server girl, Katherine. - I heard about him from our water carrier. You're drawing very nice. - You think? - Yes, yes. Really, very nice. Allow me. I'm sorry that our camp is so far away in the mountain. If someone told me that this dry can be possible, I wouldn't believe him. It's always like that here. The whole village will sing prayers for rain tomorrow. Do you know what are dodole? - Is someone still believing in that pagan ritual? What water run trough here, women... - Where did that golden land go? How much blood this dust has taken. - Waste land of Macedonia! Is it meant to be that this poor think disappear from the face of the Earth? Destiny, pure destiny... Did you see Jelica? - No. Did he see her? - He didn't. Here's a nut. This is my ranch, hundreds of cattle. Hundreds and thousands. I don't even know the number. Newspapers have written about me too. Why did you leave all that? Why did you come back? Just pure longing. I burned out, I can't take it anymore. - And then? What will you do with all that money? - Money? Damn money, I'll build a home for season workers here, so they remember me. Why do we need that home here? And why should you build that? Everyone has their own home. Don't waste money on strangers. Let's go, uncle. Uncle will take a walk now, and your father is looking for you. I don't care. Should we go right now? - Aren't we agreed on that, uncle? Marko will wait us by Stavrov's field. Come on uncle, get up. We should get there on time. So long mister Trendafil. Hold him so he doesn't fall. - He won't. Ask money from him. It's embarrassing, he'll give it himself, he said so. I want to get down. I want to stretch my legs for a bit. Our village is beautiful. - It sure is beautiful. Come on, follow me. Hurry up, Marko. Hello girls! Are you tired? Dry land, hard to work with, huh? - What can we do. Uncle, sun is too strong, you'll get sick, it's best if we go back home now. What is your name? - Uncle, let's go home, come on. It's fine like this. - Let's go. Come on Mark, if only I had your youth. - It won't go, uncle! What can I do? Don't Whitey! Whitey, get up Whitey. Get up Whitey, get up. What's wrong? - Go away, there's no engagement. - Why do you say that? He died. My Whitey. Uncle will buy you a better one, you fool. Uncle will pay. Golden uncle, Whitey died. I'm a slave uncle. With a small dowry I can find a decent husband. So I can get married, so my youth doesn't go in waste. Do you hear me, uncle? Be my father, save me. I'll remember that horse in both worlds! Golden uncle! Save me. Golden uncle. Your uncle is expecting big money from America. I'll buy you not just a horse, but everything else that a bride needs. What did I tell you? Uncle will buy you a new horse! My golden uncle. My son! Forsaken Ignjat, he's getting married again. One, two, three, four. You should get some rest now, Uncle. - It's good Katherine, very good. You'll be tired, uncle! Uncle didn't rest properly, Jelce. And brother Ignjat won't lose a single dollar! Why don't you want to play with him? Come on, don't be shy. He's your brother. Ratke! Blaguno! Brother? - What is it? I don't like what Jelce is doing. I'm scared for uncle. I'm scared for all of us. Epidemic can have catastrophic consequences. Don't wait water from the city anymore. I can't understand how are all wells in this area went dry at the sam time. So it's water pollution? - Yes. - What are you suggesting, doctor? First of all, we should find clean water. Without it we can hardly stop this epidemic. - Report has been filled. I told it to the village committee. What do you want? Can't you see I'm talking to people? I asked for a cistern to provide us water. - We're expecting a probe to search water. We should find a well? - What the hell do you want? Tell me! Can you see, brother? They're together again. I see. Send me Marko here, quickly! You should do something yourselves. Explain to people that many children will die like this. Father, father. - That's God's will. - It's not God's, it's hers. Did you search the whole are, president? No, we didn't. But we'll thoroughly inspect the field. President, you asked for me? - I want you to find a new well! Damn water! That God doesn't know what he's doing! Why is everything on us? Don't talk like that, some misery will happen. - What's worse that can happen? This one's dry too. - And now what? Now what? We're searching. Can you hear shooting? - Boulders are rolling. Did he leave? - Yes. They're all the same. Just as you think he's warm, they run away. Marija. - I can't Victor. - Why? Didn't you tell me that you want to go? Not under these circumstances. When the dry and epidemic are over, I'll think again. But because of this dry and epidemic, me and my people have to go back in town. You're something else. If I leave the village now, I couldn't respect myself anymore. Why? - You don't understand. How will the children believe in things that I teach them if I leave them now when they need me the most. If only he'd call you as he should, but not even that. "Bye honey, it was nice..." Goodbye, Victor. Yes, it was nice. Faster, father! Faster! - I can't, I'll lose my soul trough my nose! A little more father, just a little more. Uncle, uncle... Hello father! Cheers! - You peace of shit! Well done father! - You buzz now! - You talk nicely, I must say. You should care about that! Go away! You don't belong here! You're going to tell me where I belong? What are you? A bishop? Mind your own business! - Don't talk like that, he wants good. He loves you! He should get out of my sight! Coward! - Uncle should go home, too. Come on golden uncle. Brother Ignjat will be very angry. He shouldn't be angry about anything? Am I spending his money maybe? It's enough Trendafil, it's late. - It's time to go! Come on golden uncle. Your Katherine will take you home, come on. Only for your love. Everything that was ordered, put it on my tab. - It's too much tabs already, too much. When the dollars arrive, you'll get everything you want. We'll see about that. It's very inappropriate for you father, to sit in bars this late at night. Why didn't you go to sleep? I can manage him by myself. Go to sleep, you have to go to work tomorrow. She can't go, no! She must stay here. I love you so much! - Uncle! - I love her so much, and you too Katherine. I love you two the most! Katherine, you will marry a young man, as a pretty girl should do. Who do you want to marry? If you want to marry Marko, so be it! Money, dowry, everything! - My dear uncle! Jelce! Jelce, honey! America is empty! America is not there, America is here! Youth and beauty is here! Never again I'll to for season work! I'll stay here! I'll be yours, and I'll build a home. Big home for season workers. - Don't build that. Not just one! Not two, I'll build three! Uncle, Ignjat, brother Ignjat is there. - Ignjat who? Mine! Mine Ignjat. Son of mine most loved sister. Ignjat, my child! Let me hug you! - Come on, don't drool! Didn't I tell you, pretty girl, to leave old man alone! - Ignjat! - Shut up! We love each other Ignjat, we'll go to sea... - Uncle, uncle... Get up there! Let this be the last time I saw you with him! Jelica, is that true? Yes, yes, we'll go to sea, we'll bathe... You won't go to sea, and you won't bathe! - Why not? I won't allow it! You won't spend your money on girls! I won't allow it! Money will be at my possession! Do you understand? Money! That dollars that you're expecting! Move away/! I have no money. You're lying! I'm not lying, Ignjat. My whole life I dreamt about wealth, about the money that I can go home with. So I can live peacefully with it. Nothing is left, sonny, nothing! I was too afraid to die there. I wanted to die here, here. Be reasonable! Where are you going alone at night? Jelce! You'll go to the sea! Water will kill you! Come on now, I wish you a safe trip. God bless you, to come from season work great profit, God bless you. God bless you, to come from season work great profit, God bless you. Marko! Stop! THE END Translated by Inglourious @KG
