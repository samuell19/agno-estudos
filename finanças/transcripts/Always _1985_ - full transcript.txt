I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT EXACTLY. I WAS SO HAPPY. I WAS SO PERFECTLY HAPPY. I FOUND THE PERSON I WANTED TO BE WITH THE REST OF MY LIFE. WE MET, WE LIVED TOGETHER FOR A WHILE AND THEN WE MARRIED. FIVE YEARS MARRIED, SEVEN YEARS TOGETHER. EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. WE KEPT TALKING ABOUT HOW LUCKY WE WERE, HOW THERE WAS NOTHING WE HAD TO WORRY ABOUT, HOW AMAZING THE WHOLE THING WAS, HOW PERFECT IT WAS. THEN ONE DAY SHE CAME HOME FROM YOGA CLASS. HI. HI. WHAT'S WRONG? NOTHING. YOU LOOK FUNNY. WHAT IS IT? I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, BABY? I DON'T THINK I CAN LIVE WITH YOU ANYMORE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I DON'T THINK I CAN LIVE WITH YOU ANYMORE. I WAS IN A LOT OF PAIN AND WENT THROUGH TWO TERRIBLE YEARS. CRYING, SCREAMING. UNBELIEVABLE YEARS WHEN YOU THINK PAIN IS NEVER GOING TO GO AWAY. AND THEN THE PAIN GOES AWAY AND YOU GET BETTER, FEEL BETTER. TONIGHT SHE'S COMING OVER TO SIGN THE DIVORCE AGREEMENT. TWO YEARS HAVE GONE BY. I HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN ABOUT SIX MONTHS. AND WE'RE GOING TO SIGN OUR DIVORCE AGREEMENT TONIGHT. IN HONOR OF THE OCCASION I DECIDED TO COOK HER DINNER. SHE DOESN'T KNOW. I'VE NEVER COOKED BEFORE SO SHE'LL BE SURPRISED. I'M GONNA GO MAKE HER DINNER. * * TELL ME THAT IT'S TRUE * * TELL ME YOU AGREE * * I WAS MEANT FOR YOU * * YOU WERE MEANT FOR ME * * DEARLY BELOVED, HOW CLEARLY I SEE * * SOMEWHERE IN HEAVEN * * YOU WERE FASHIONED FOR ME * * ANGEL EYES KNEW YOU * * ANGEL VOICES LED ME TO YOU * * NOTHING COULD SAVE ME * * FATE GAVE ME A SIGN * * I KNOW THAT I'LL BE YOURS * * COME SHOWER OR SHINE * * SO I SAY MERELY * * DEARLY BELOVED BE MINE * * * * YOU WERE MEANT FOR ME * * I WAS MEANT FOR YOU * * TELL ME YOU AGREE TELL ME THAT IT'S TRUE * (DOORBELL) COMING! COMING! (DOORBELL) COMING! COMING, COMING! HI, BABY. HI. BEEN A WHILE. YOU OKAY? FINE, HOW ARE YOU? FINE. IT'S A LITTLE FUNNY TO BE HERE. CAN WE KISS? OKAY. WITHOUT ANY EMOTION, JUST A LITTLE SUPERFICIAL KISS. AS LONG AS WE'VE LAID THE GROUND RULES, OKAY. WATCH THIS, REAL SIMPLE. YOU KNOW... OH, MORE. OH, MY GOD, THE FISH! COME IN. I GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU. COME TO THE KITCHEN. I DID A LITTLE SOMETHING. MADE YOU A LITTLE DINNER HERE. JUST GO AWAY, GO AWAY! DAVID, THIS ISN'T FOR ME, RIGHT? IT'S OUR DINNER. I WANTED TO COOK FOR YOU AS A SURPRISE. DON'T LOOK AT IT! JUST, PLEASE, I PROMISE THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT. BUT I REALLY HAVE TO- LISTEN TO ME, I HAVE OTHER PLANS. I CAN'T STAY FOR DINNER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T STAY FOR DINNER, BABY? I'M MAKING DINNER. I'M MAKING YOU A DIVORCE DINNER, BABY. THIS IS REALLY HORRENDOUS. WAIT 'TIL YOU SEE THE DINING ROOM. OH, WAIT. I GOTTA MAKE A PHONE CALL. WHAT KIND OF PHONE CALL? I TOLD YOU, I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT. I GOTTA MAKE A PHONE CALL. WHO DO YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH? I HAD SOMETHING PLANNED FOR THIS EVENING AND I HAVE TO CALL THEM. WE'LL HAVE DINNER... BABY, LET'S HAVE DINNER AND THEN YOU- THIS IS OUR LAST DINNER AS A MARRIED COUPLE. LET'S HAVE IT AND RIGHT NOW I DON'T WANT YOU CALLING ANYBODY AND LETTING ANYBODY ELSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF IT. I'LL CALL AFTER DINNER. THAT WAS REALLY GOOD. REALLY DELICIOUS, I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT. I MADE IT. WHAT GOT INTO YOU? I JUST THOUGHT THAT WE SHOULD CELEBRATE. THIS IS A REALLY GOOD CELEBRATION. WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER COOK? I DIDN'T KNOW I COULD COOK. I JUST FOLLOWED THIS BOOK. THERE WAS A MAD KIND OF LOGIC TO IT. ADD A LITTLE OF THAT, A LITTLE OF THIS. COOKING IS VERY LOGICAL. YOU JUST DO ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER - AND YOU BUILD IT. - IT'S LIKE LOGIC. LIKE LIFE, HUH? SIMPLE AND LOGICAL LIKE LIFE. OH, YOU LIKE THE NUTS, YEAH. LET ME FEED YOU. I USED TO LOVE TO FEED YOU, REMEMBER? LOOK, HERE'S ANOTHER ONE. THAT'S A GOOD ONE. THEY'RE REALLY GOOD. OH, MAN. CHOCOLATE COVERED PECANS. TAKE THE NUTS AND SHUT UP. THOSE ARE THE RULES? SORRY, EXCUSE ME, NO RULES. I HAPPEN TO LIKE, MORE THAN I EVER HAVE BEFORE IN MY LIFE, CHOCOLATE. I'VE BECOME A LITTLE BIT OBSESSED FOR REASONS I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WITH CHOCOLATE IN THESE PAST TWO YEARS. YOU KNOW WHAT CHOCOLATE HAS IN IT. CHOCOLATE HAS SOMETHING IN IT THAT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN LOVE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IT HAS THIS CHEMICAL IN IT THAT'S THE SAME CHEMICAL YOUR BRAIN PRODUCES WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE. WHEN YOU EAT CHOCOLATE YOU GET THAT SAME SENSATION. THAT'S WHY YOU EAT CHOCOLATE. SO I'M NOT GOING TO EAT ANYMORE CHOCOLATE. EVER AGAIN. MAYBE. YOU KNOW A GUY'S COMING OVER HERE TONIGHT? WHO'S COMING OVER? A GUY. TO FINISH THINGS OFF. YOU UNDERSTAND? YOU MEAN THAT, UM... NOTARY. AND HE'S GOING TO DO WHATEVER NOTARIES DO. HE'S GOING TO MAKE THE FINAL THING FINAL. LET'S HAVE SOME MORE WINE. MORE WINE, OKAY. TO A VERY HAPPY FUTURE FOR YOU IN WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU WANT TO FIND THAT'LL MAKE YOU HAPPY. AND YOU. MY FUTURE, MY HAPPY FUTURE IS IN MY PAST. HAPPY FUTURE. HAPPY PAST. (DOORBELL) THERE'S THE GUY. BE RIGHT BACK. HI, COME IN. YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE. I'M A LITTLE LATE, YES. I'M SURE THE DIRECTIONS WERE GOOD BUT I WAS NOT GOOD. HELLO. THIS IS MY WIFE. PLEASED TO MEET YOU. I'M SAMUEL. NICE TO MEET YOU. MY WIFE - CAN I SAY THAT STILL? I AM STILL YOUR WIFE. SHE'S STILL YOUR WIFE A FEW MORE DAYS. HAVE A SEAT, PLEASE. WHERE CAN I PUT THIS? HERE, I'LL MOVE THIS OUT OF YOUR WAY. CAN I HAVE SOME IDENTIFICATION? I NEED THE DRIVING LICENSE. I NEED MY DRIVING LICENSE? I'VE GOT THEM BOTH. BIRTH CERTIFICATE, PASSPORT OR MAJOR CREDIT CARD. HERE'S THE DRIVER'S LICENSE. AND HERE'S HER CREDIT CARD. AND MY CREDIT CARD. I THINK I'LL HAVE SOME WINE. I DON'T BLAME YOU. OKAY. WHAT'S THIS? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? A RECORD OF OUR DIVORCE. LAST PHOTO TOGETHER AS A MARRIED COUPLE. HAPPY. OKAY. THAT'S NOT A VERY GOOD SIGNATURE. DOES IT MATTER IF IT'S A LITTLE, UH... NO, IT DOESN'T MATTER. SHH, BABY, SHH. IT'S OKAY. LISTEN, I UM... I, UM... LISTEN, I UM... OH, BABY. NO, MY DARLING. CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION? WHY ARE YOU HAVING A DIVORCE? WHY YOU TWO ARE GOING TO DIVORCE? I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO IT, REALLY. I'D CRY. I KNOW BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN A COUPLE LIKE YOU. SO WHY DO IT? NO. NO, I'M NOT GONNA DO IT. I'M NOT GONNA DO IT. HERE'S MY CARD AND MY ADDRESS. YOU COME TO ME ON MONDAY IF YOU STILL DECIDE TO DO IT. I HOPE I WON'T SEE YOU MONDAY. I'M NOT TAKING MONEY, I'M NOT TAKING ANYTHING. I KNOW IT'S MORE MONEY TO COME TO THE HOUSE. NO, NO, I'M SORRY. I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT TODAY. YOU CAN CHANGE NOTARY, YOU CAN GO TO ANYONE YOU WANT. WHY NOT? BECAUSE I'M A STRANGE MAN. I'M STRANGE. I SOMETIMES READ BOOKS AND SOME THINGS TOUCH ME, SO... I REALLY CANNOT DO IT TODAY. SO I DID ONE REVOLUTIONARY MOVE IN MY LIFE. IF YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH WITH IT YOU CAN COME TO ME ON MONDAY. IS THIS OKAY? I'LL BE AT MY OFFICE AND I HOPE I WON'T SEE YOU. HAPPY FOURTH OF JULY. WANT TO DANCE? SURE. I FIGURED SOMETHING OUT. WHAT'D YOU FIGURE OUT? I FIGURED OUT THAT THESE ARE MY SAD YEARS. MY CYNICAL YEARS, YOU KNOW? MY BOGART YEARS. (LAUGHING) KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SO I MIGHT AS WELL ENJOY THEM. YOU'RE NOT TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY ENOUGH. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT NIGHT IN OUR LIVES. IT IS? * SOME DAY WE'LL BUILD A HOME ON A HILLTOP HIGH * * YOU AND I, SHINY AND NEW * * A COTTAGE THAT TWO CAN FILL * * AND WE'LL BE PLEASED TO BE CALLED * * "THE FOLKS WHO LIVE ON THE HILL" * DO YOU REMEMBER DANCING?

HAVE YOU BEEN CRYING? YEAH. WHAT'S THE MATTER? I'M NOT HAPPY. WHAT IS HAPPY? I'VE NEVER FOUND A GOOD DEFINITION OF IT. I THINK YOU'RE HAPPY. YOU AND DAVID ARE HAPPY. HOW ARE YOU AND DAVID? WE'RE NOT REALLY GOOD RIGHT NOW. IT HAS BEEN GOOD, THOUGH. YEAH, IT WAS GOOD AND IT'S NOT GOOD RIGHT NOW. IT'LL BE GOOD AGAIN. IT'LL BE GOOD AGAIN? IT WILL. IS THAT THE WAY IT GOES? THE ONLY THING THAT HAS ANY MEANING IN THIS WORLD IS LOVE. IT'S A BIG UGLY WORLD OUT THERE, AND TO BE WITH A MAN THAT CARES FOR YOU AND LOVES YOU DEEPLY... I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD LET IT GO. I FEEL REALLY SCARED. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SCARED. I'M SCARED THOUGH. AW, BABY. * SOME DAY WE'LL BUILD A HOME ON A HILLTOP HIGH * * YOU AND I SHINY AND NEW * * A COTTAGE THAT TWO CAN FILL * * AND WE'LL BE PLEASED TO BE CALLED * * "THE FOLKS WHO LIVE ON THE HILL" * * * HI.

WHO ARE YOU CALLING? I'M CALLING THE YOGA CENTER. JOHN, IT'S JUDY. I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT IN THIS MORNING. IF YOU COULD TEACH MY CLASS THIS MORNING FOR ME I'LL TEACH YOUR CLASS ON TUESDAY MORNING. YEAH, OKAY. I APPRECIATE IT A LOT. THANK YOU. BYE NOW. WHAT'S THE MATTER? I DON'T FEEL GOOD, I'M REALLY SICK. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GAVE ME. WHAT I GAVE YOU? WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY? I GAVE YOU FISH, BEAUTIFUL FISH I WORKED SO HARD ON. I'VE NEVER BEEN SO SICK IN MY LIFE. THIS IS AWFUL. MAYBE THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE FISH. OHHH. I PUT ALL KINDS OF TERRIFIC THINGS IN THE FISH. I'M GONNA CALL PEGGY. WHAT FOR? TO COME AND TAKE CARE OF ME. I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

YEAH, NO, I WANT YOU TO JUST BRING THEM, ALRIGHT? I NEED SOME VITAMIN C. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO TO MY HOUSE TO GET THIS. - I NEED ACIDOPHELIS. - A BOTTLE OF IT.

WHY DON'T YOU GO ANSWER IT. IT CAN'T BE HER. GO ANSWER THE DOOR, GO ON. LET'S JUST FORGET IT. LET'S GO BACK TO SLEEP. (DOORBELL RINGING) I THINK YOU BETTER ANSWER IT. BYE BYE. (DOORBELL) COMING! COMING, COMING, COMING. HI! OH, MY GOD. HI. COME IN, COME IN. HI, SWEETHEART. MMM. I THOUGHT WE'D NEVER GET DOWN HERE. YEAH, WELL, HI. PUT YOUR BAGS DOWN HERE. WE'LL PUT YOU IN A ROOM LATER ON. COUPLE OF CHANGES PLANNED FOR THE WEEKEND. I KINDA FORGOT THAT I HAD, UH... I FORGOT YOU WERE COMING. WHICH IS NO PROBLEM, NO PROBLEM. IT JUST MEANS I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU. YOU FORGOT WE WERE COMING? HOW COULD YOU DO THAT? I'M VERY HAPPY THAT YOU'RE HERE. THERE IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN FORGETTING YOU WERE COMING AND BEING REALLY HAPPY THAT YOU'RE HERE. NOW I'VE GOT A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU. ARE WE GOING TO LIKE THIS SURPRISE? I HOPE SO, LET'S GO. LEAVE THE BAGS, WE'LL PICK THEM UP LATER. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? HOW'S WORK GOING? GOOD, GOOD. THE SURPRISE IS DOWN THE HALL. SURPRISE, SURPRISE. I'VE GOT A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU. JUDY! JUDY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? LET ME GET SOME OF THIS. OH, I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? OH, I'M SICK. SHE'S HAD A SLIGHT CASE OF INDIGESTION. NO? OR ALLERGY OR... SHE CLAIMS I POISONED HER. YOU COOKED? YEAH, I COOKED A WHOLE MEAL. WHITE FISH. I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT. WELL, YOU LOOK GOOD. I LOOK AWFUL. DO YOU HAVE A FEVER? HAVE YOU CALLED A DOCTOR? NO, SHE JUST NEEDS SOME REST. I JUST HAVE TO LIE DOWN. I ATE IT, I'M NOT SICK. IT WAS WONDERFUL. I THINK YOU POISONED ME. DELIBERATELY SHE THINKS I POISONED HER. I THINK YOU MADE SOMETHING I'M ALLERGIC TO AND FED IT TO ME. BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE ALLERGIC TO IT. PROBABLY HE DID, HE JUST FORGOT. WHAT KIND OF A VEGETABLE? MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE THEM OUT OF HERE AND LET YOU REST A BIT. (CRYING) (CRYING) A LITTLE COLD HERE. IT'S WARMER IN SANTA BARBARA. WHAT'S THE STORY? IT'S LIKE IT'S THE FOUR OF US AGAIN. YEAH, WELL. I MISS YOU. I MISS YOU, TOO. YOU NEVER CALL ME. I DO TOO. NO, YOU DON'T. I CALLED YOU TWO MONTHS AGO. I ALWAYS CALL YOU AND YOU NEVER CALL ME. I DON'T CALL ANYBODY. IT'S NO EXCUSE, I'M NOT "ANYBODY". I'M AFRAID I'LL CRY ON THE PHONE WITH YOU. SO WHAT? OKAY, THIS IS IT. SORRY, DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF A CHANCE TO GET - CAN I JUST PUT THIS DOWN HERE - GET ANYTHING READY FOR YOU, BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU DID COME IN UNEXPECTEDLY. YOU'VE LOST WEIGHT. I DID LOSE A LITTLE WEIGHT, DIDN'T I? WE ARE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS WEEKEND. GOOD, GOOD. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S BEEN LIKE THESE TWO AND A HALF YEARS. I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU IT'S BEEN VERY ROUGH. WE'VE BEEN STUCK IN THE HOUSE, THE BABY'S TERRIFIC, WE LOVE THE BABY BUT WE CAN'T GET OUT OF THE HOUSE BECAUSE SHE WON'T LEAVE HIM ALONE. SHE WON'T HIRE A SITTER. NOT A DINNER OUT IN TWO AND A HALF YEARS. YOU HAVEN'T LEFT THE HOUSE. WE HAVE NOT LEFT THE HOUSE - THE THREE OF US GO GROCERY SHOPPING BUT IT'S ALL TOGETHER AGAIN. WHAT DO YOU DO FOR ENTERTAINMENT? WE WATCH TV. WE WATCH TV, YOU KNOW? AND THE BABY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE TV BUT AT LEAST HE WATCHES THE TV. (KNOCKING) LISTEN, I'LL SEE YOU LATER, OKAY? COMING! HI! HI, HOW ARE YOU? HOW ARE YOU DOING? I'M DOING GOOD, I'M MAD AT YOU. WHAT DID I DO? I NEVER HEAR FROM YOU. I NEVER SEE YOU ANYMORE. WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GOING ON WITH JUDY? I DON'T KNOW. I HOPE THEY GET TOGETHER. YOU'RE STILL MY BROTHER IN LAW? I'LL ALWAYS BE YOUR BROTHER IN LAW. WE COULD HAVE OUR FRIENDS BACK. THAT WOULD BE GREAT. WE'D HAVE TO MOVE BACK AGAIN. SO WE'LL MOVE BACK. YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT LIVING IN SANTA BARBARA ANYWAY. I'D LIKE TO MOVE BACK AGAIN. EVEN IF THEY DON'T GET TOGETHER WE CAN MOVE BACK. I MISS YOU. YOU DON'T MISS ME ENOUGH TO SEE ME. I FEEL FUNNY TO CALL. I NEVER LET WHAT OUT? YOUR EMOTIONS. YOU KNOW THAT, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT. YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT BUT I HAVEN'T NECESSARILY AGREED WITH YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? TAKING MY CLOTHES OFF. YOU WAIT TIL THE NIGHT TIME. YOU'RE SUCH A PRUDE, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. HOW DID YOU GET HER HERE? HOW'D I GET HER HERE? HI, WHO ARE YOU? MAXWELL. MAXWELL? HERE, MAXWELL, WHY DON'T YOU... WHAT'S THIS? STAY DOWN HERE AND GUARD HER STUFF, MAXWELL. SEE YOU IN A LITTLE BIT. SO, LISTEN, UM... THERE SHE IS. HI. (LAUGHING) YOU OKAY? I FEEL TERRIBLE. WHAT HAPPENED? I GOT SICK. I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE. HOW ARE YOU? I'M OKAY. HONEY, YOU'VE GOT A FEW HOLES IN YOUR EARS. I KNOW. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. (LAUGHING) WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH YOURSELF? WHAT IS ALL OF THIS? WHERE'D YOU GET THIS JACKET? I GOT THIS IN NEW YORK. WE JUST GOT HERE, YOU KNOW? WHO'S MAXWELL? A MAN I MET IN NEW YORK. AND THIS MAXWELL DRIVES AN ICE CREAM TRUCK, HUH? WELL, FOR A LITTLE WHILE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO KNOW. HUH? I'M REALLY SICK. I'M REALLY SICK. I THINK HE FED ME SOMETHING POISONOUS. (LAUGHING) YOU CAME FOR DINNER? YEAH, AND HE COOKED IT. HE COOKED IT? (LAUGHING) NO WONDER YOU'RE SICK. I KNOW. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. DID YOU BRING MY VITAMINS? HOW'S 30? WILL THAT DO IT? SIX PEOPLE, 30 BUCKS? BETTER MAKE IT $40. OKAY, WE'LL GO WITH $40. HERE, TAKE $40. BETTER MAKE IT $50. OKAY, BUT I WANT CHANGE. ANYTHING? YOU KNOW, LUNCHEON MEATS, COLESLAW, POTATO SALAD. GET A LOT OF STUFF. DO YOU KNOW A NICE PLACE? YEAH, IS THERE ANYTHING YOU DON'T EAT? NO, I EAT EVERYTHING. REALLY? I WISH I COULD EAT EVERYTHING 'CAUSE I HAVE SOME ALLERGIES. NOT EXACTLY A BAD LUNCH. NOT REALLY WHAT I HAD IN MIND BUT IT WAS OKAY. I TOLD HIM WE WERE SIX. DO YOU HAVE ANY CHANGE? NO, SIX POUNDS OF MEAT. IT'S A LOT OF FOOD FOR SIX PEOPLE. THEY SAID A POUND A PERSON. PERSONALLY I WOULD HAVE RATHER GONE DOWN TO THE MARINA. THAT'S WHAT I HAD IN MIND, COME DOWN TO LA. HOW DO YOU FEEL? BETTER. YOU LOOK WONDERFUL. I WOULD HAVE LIKED SOME SUN. (VARIOUS CONVERSATIONS) LET'S GO OUT, TO THE MARINA, YOU KNOW? GO SOME PLACE GOOD? I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD GO HOME TONIGHT. COME ON, WHY CAN'T WE GO OUT? TOMORROW'S THE 4TH OF JULY, I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A BARBECUE HERE. YOU GUYS LIKE A BARBECUE? TOMORROW? A BARBECUE WOULD BE GREAT. ARE THEY GOING TO STAY? I WANT YOU TO STAY. THAT'S A GREAT IDEA, YOU COULD STAY TOO. I'D LOVE A BARBECUE. IF YOU STAY I'LL STAY. OKAY, I'LL STAY. CAN MAXWELL STAY HERE? MAXWELL? I GUESS MAXWELL'S GONNA HAVE TO STAY. WE CAN ARRANGE A DECENT DINNER, I DON'T WANT ANY MORE OF THIS. THIS IS REALLY AWFUL. MAXWELL AND I CAN MAKE SOMETHING. WHAT ABOUT GOING OUT FOR SOMETHING? NO, SHE'S SICK. SPAGO, SOME PLACE NICE. WE SEND MAXWELL OUT FOR SOME DECENT FOOD? I SEND HIM TO THE GROCERY STORE. I'M HERE TO SERVE. BASICALLY. WE'VE BEEN COOPED UP FOR TWO YEARS WITH A BABY. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE? YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE, DO YOU? I'VE READ ABOUT IT. WHO IS THIS GUY? SOMEBODY THAT I MET IN NEW YORK. I HAVE A GOOD TIME WITH. COMFORTABLE WITH. HE'S NICE? HE'S PRETTY NICE, PRETTY NICE GUY. HE'S NOT MY USUAL SORT OF GUY. NO, HE'S A LITTLE SOLID ALMOST, I WOULD HESITATE TO USE THAT WORD WITH YOU BUT HE SEEMS NICE, HE SEEMS STABLE. HE KNOWS HOW TO SAY MORE THAN JUST "HUH?" BETTER THAN YOUR USUAL "HUH?" BUT IS HE CUTE ENOUGH FOR YOU? YOU'RE USUALLY ATTRACTED TO THOSE DUMB HULKS? HE'S CUTE BUT HE'S CUTE IN A CUTE WAY RATHER THAN CUTE IN A STUNNING WAY. I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE HIM 'CAUSE HE'S KINDA SMART. HE SEEMS QUITE SMART. MAYBE HE'S TOO SMART IN A WAY. CAN'T BE TOO SMART FOR YOU, KID. NO, I GUESS NOT. I'M HAPPY TO SEE YOU AGAIN. ARE THERE ANY MORE LIKE YOU ANYWHERE YOU KNOW ABOUT? ASK YOUR SISTER. APPARENTLY BEING ONE OF ME ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH. SO HE POISONED ME. NO, HE DID NOT. HE GAVE ME SOMETHING AWFUL. HE DIDN'T. ALTHOUGH WITH ME IT'S HARD TO TELL BECAUSE I'M ALLERGIC TO SO MANY THINGS. IT COULD BE COFFEE OR THE WINE I DRANK... HOW ARE YOU FEELING NOW? I'M BETTER, I'M BETTER. YOU LOOK SO PRETTY. OH, THANK YOU. THANKS. YOU ALWAYS LOOK PRETTY. MORE THAN PRETTY, BEAUTIFUL. ALWAYS. ARE YOU HAPPY? YES. YOU'RE HAPPY? YEAH. TELL ME THE TRUTH. ARE YOU REALLY HAPPY? I NEED TO KNOW NOW. LIKE A REAL QUESTION, YOU KNOW? I CERTAINLY AM MORE FULFILLED THAN I'VE EVER BEEN BEFORE. HAPPIER, BUT THERE ARE AREAS, HOLES, YOU KNOW? I DON'T CONCERN MYSELF WITH THEM TOO MUCH. HOW DO YOU NOT CONCERN YOURSELF WITH BIG HOLES IN YOUR LIFE? I DON'T KNOW HOW BIG THEY ARE. DON'T YOU EVER WONDER HOW BIG THEY ARE AND LOOK AT THEM AND DECIDE? UH, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SO BUSY GIVING TO THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN YOUR NUCLEUS AND IT'S SUCH A CONSTANT DEMAND ON YOU AND YOU'RE GETTING SUCH FULFILLMENT FROM IT THAT YOU JUST KIND OF LET GO OF THOSE OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN THERE ALL YOUR LIFE. THE THINGS THAT SAY "ME. HOW DO I GET THIS FOR MYSELF?" I DON'T HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT ANYMORE. THERE'S THIS LITTLE CHILD THAT'S ALWAYS SAYING "ME, ME, ME". THERE'S THIS BIG MAN THAT'S ALWAYS SAYING "ME, ME, ME". MY LIFE IS SAYING "ME, ME, ME" INSTEAD OF ME SAYING "ME, ME, ME". AND YOU? UH UH. AT ALL? HMMM... AT A REAL DEEP LEVEL, UNHAPPY. LOTS OF TIME BEING HAPPY, YOU KNOW, ON THE SURFACE. BUT AT THE BOTTOM WHEN I JUST SIT AND LOOK AT MY LIFE I'M DISSATISFIED. DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DISSATISFIED WITH? I'M DISSATISFIED WITH NOT HAVING IT BE PERFECT. IT WAS ALL SUPPOSED TO BE PERFECT. BUT THAT'S A FAIRY TALE. YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT AND I STILL DON'T KNOW THAT AND I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE IT. (HEY, LUCY?) I BETTER SEE WHAT HE WANTS. HI. HI. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, HUH? WHAT DO I THINK WHAT? WHAT DO YOU THINK, ARE YOU HAPPY? I DON'T KNOW. COME ON OVER HERE. WANT A HUG? JUST STAY LIKE THAT. JUST STAY NOT KNOWING, IT WORKS BETTER. I HAVE A THEORY, THOUGH. WHAT'S YOUR THEORY? WELL, EVERYTHING IS IN YOUR BRAIN, RIGHT? SO YOU CAN JUST MAKE A DECISION AND YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT, YOU CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT, YOU CAN HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? NO, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT'S LIKE WITH ME AND MAXWELL, RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT I LOVE HIM AND IT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO ME WHETHER OR NOT I LOVE HIM. I'M COMFORTABLE WITH HIM. SO I CAN CHOOSE IN MY BRAIN TO LOVE HIM AND BE HAPPY WITH HIM, AND THEN IN THE END IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT, THEN IT'S NOT PAINFUL, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH. YOU SEE? AND IT MAKES EVERYTHING MUCH, MUCH EASIER. AND IT'S NO BIG DEAL. LIFE... IT'S SIMPLE, IT'S EASY. YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING, YOU BREATHE THE AIR, YOU EAT, SLEEP, AND YOU'RE IN CONTROL OF IT ALL. YOU'RE IN CONTROL OF IT ALL. INSIDE OF HERE. IT'S YOUR OWN PERCEPTION. HOW YOU CHOOSE TO SEE THINGS WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE OUT OF IT AND WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE OUT OF YOUR OWN LIFE. ONCE YOU SEE IT AS A BUNCH OF CHOICES IT'S EASY. * * IT REALLY DEPRESSES ME THIS WHOLE THING BECAUSE ALL I FEEL FROM IT IS THAT THERE'S NO CHANCE ANYBODY CAN REALLY KNOW ANYBODY. 'CAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW ME I'M NEVER GOING TO BE KNOWN. FEEL KNOWN. IF YOU NEED TO INSIST THAT I DIDN'T KNOW YOU- I DON'T THINK THERE'S SOME OBJECTIVE FACT HERE, IT'S A SUBJECTIVE PERCEPTION. IF I DON'T FEEL KNOWN, I'M NOT KNOWN. RIGHT? THERE'S SUBJECTIVITY INVOLVED, NOTHING ELSE. IT'S ALL WHAT WE FEEL IS OUR REALITY. MM HM. SO I DON'T FEEL THAT IF YOU HAD KNOWN ME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO LEAVE. THEREFORE YOU LEFT SOMEBODY ELSE, THE IDEA OF WHO I WAS TO YOU. MAYBE. THAT MEANS YOU DIDN'T KNOW ME. THAT MEANS THAT I WAS ALONE WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS WITH YOU. THAT'S A VERY HARD THING TO DEAL WITH. I THINK IT MAY BE ONE OF THE REALITIES OF LIFE THAT NOBODY EVER REALLY KNOWS EVERY ASPECT OF YOU. I DON'T MEAN EVERY ASPECT, I MEAN THAT THING IN THE DEEPEST PART OF YOUR CHILDHOOD THAT NEEDS TO BE KNOWN. I KNOW THAT PART. AND THAT NEEDS TO FEEL IN TOUCH WITH ANOTHER HUMAN BEING AND THAT OTHER HUMAN BEING WILL ALLOW YOU TO DO ANYTHING AND BE ANYTHING AND BE THERE FOR YOU REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU ARE. THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO SOMETHING OR BE SOMETHING OR ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING OR MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN OR NOT BE SOMETHING ELSE OR YOU ARE IN FEAR OF THEM LEAVING YOU. IT'S NOT WORTH SHIT IF YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO EARN IT. IF YOU HAVE TO ALTER YOURSELF ONE MILLIMETER IT'S NOT WORTH ANYTHING. I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN HOW TO BE CHARMING AND WONDERFUL AND MAKE EVERYBODY LOVE ME IF I WANTED TO, YOU KNOW THAT. BUT IF I HAVE TO DO THAT THEN IT'S NOT THEM LOVING ME AND THEN I'M NOT FEELING LOVED OR KNOWN AND THEN IT'S USELESS. THEREFORE I'D RATHER THAT EVERYONE HATES ME EXCEPT FOR TWO PEOPLE WHO KNOW ME WELL ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF I'M THIS ASSHOLE THAT HAS TO GET UP ON A TABLE- REMEMBER I TOLD YOU THE FIRST DATE WE HAD THAT I NEEDED SOMEBODY TO KNOW THAT IF I GOT UP ON A TABLE IN THE FANCIEST RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD AND HAD TO TAKE A SHIT ON THE TABLE THEY WOULD BE THERE FOR ME. THEY WOULDN'T GO "OH, MY GOD, HOW DISGUSTING" AND LEAVE? THEY WOULD JUST SAY "OKAY, COME DOWN NOW. YOU'VE TAKEN YOUR SHIT ON THE TABLE" AND THEN MAYBE I WON'T HAVE TO TAKE A SHIT ON THE TABLE. YES. OKAY, SO THAT'S BEING KNOWN. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT YOU DID FOR ME. I THINK I DID. YOU COULDN'T HAVE LEFT. PEGGY? PEGGY? IT'S MAXWELL. I HAVE YOUR STILTS. THERE YOU ARE. HERE. GOT 'EM, THANKS. THIS IS GREAT. OH, WILL YOU GO UP AND GET ME MY DRESS? WHAT DO YOU NEED YOUR DRESS FOR? I'M GOING TO SHOW JUDY MY STILTS AND I DON'T WANT TO SHOW HER WITHOUT THE DRESS. IT'S NOT THE SAME THING. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND DID YOU FULLY KNOW ME? THERE WERE PLENTY OF ASPECTS OF MY PERSONALITY I WOULD TELL YOU ABOUT BUT YOU WOULD JUST SAY "OH, YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT". I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT BELIEFS NOW, I'M TALKING ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS PEOPLE. WHO I AM IS A- WHAT I BELIEVE IS A REFLECTION OF WHO I AM. TAKE IT AWAY FROM THE INTELLECT, WOULD YOU? I'M TALKING ABOUT WHERE THERE'S A LITTLE BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL RUNNING AROUND TRYING TO FEEL OKAY. AND I KNEW YOUR LITTLE GIRL AND I WAS ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HER. YES, AND MY LITTLE GIRL HAD A HARD TIME SOMETIMES BEING AROUND YOUR LITTLE BOY. THAT'S NOT FAIR. I KNOW IT'S NOT FAIR. WHAT'S IT LIKE HAVING SEX WITH THE SAME MAN FOR 12 YEARS? DO YOU DO DIFFERENT THINGS? YEAH, OF COURSE WE DO DIFFERENT THINGS. WHAT DO YOU DO? I'M ALWAYS WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE. AND YOU DO DIFFERENT THINGS, RIGHT? BUT I'D THINK IF YOU'RE WITH THE SAME PERSON FOR 12 YEARS IT'D GET BORING AFTER A WHILE. WELL, IT COMES FROM A DIFFERENT PLACE. IT'S COMING FROM YOUR HEART. YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING? MAXWELL! TURN IT ON! MAXWELL! * SHAKE THOSE MARACAS, ENTWINE ARM IN MINE * * WHILE BONGOS BEAT MADLY A RHYTHM SO DIVINE * * FIRING INSPIRING THAT LOVELY RUM, BACARDI * * SHAKE IT AND MAKE IT THE LIFE OF EVERY PARTY * * WITH TENDER PASSION A SECRET ISLAND BAR * * THE RUMBA PARTY MEANS THE RUMBA OF THE HEART * SO YOU HAVE A NICE FIRST DAY? A LITTLE COLD FOR ME BUT AT LEAST THE EGG ROLL'S WARM. I PROMISE IT'S GOING TO GET WARM AND BEAUTIFUL. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING RIGHT HERE AND NOW. AND THAT IS THAT MAXWELL AND I ARE GETTING MARRIED. MY GOD. YOU'RE WHAT? YES. YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED? NO. YES. MAXWELL LOOKS AS SURPRISED AS WE ARE. THIS IS, I'M STUNNED. I KNEW SHE ADORED ME. AND I'M CRAZY ABOUT HER. BUT THE FACT IS THAT WE NEVER DISCUSSED THIS. AT WORST I'LL DIVORCE HER AND GET A SETTLEMENT. OKAY, EVERYTHING'S READY. WE CAN ALL GO INSIDE. I'M HAPPY IF YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING. I DO THINK I'M DOING THE RIGHT THING. THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I'M DOING IT. I'M JUST OUTRAGED AT YOUR BEHAVIOR! WHAT DO YOU MEAN "WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?" I WANT TO GO OUT, I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE. GET ME THE TURKEY. DON'T TALK SO LOUD. YOU REALLY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS? WHEN DID YOU DECIDE THIS? A FEW HOURS AGO. DID YOU THINK YOU SHOULD TELL MAXWELL? NO, I FIGURED HE WOULD GO ALONG WITH IT. HE'S BEEN GAME FOR EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE SO FAR. I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS DEPRESSES ME. LOOK, I WANTED TO GO OUT, I WANTED TO HAVE A NICE WEEKEND. YOU ARE THE MOST RIGID MAN I HAVE EVER MET IN MY LIFE. WOULD YOU PLEASE TAKE THE TURKEY. TAKE THIS, TAKE THIS, TAKE THIS! IS IT HOT? OF COURSE IT'S HOT. WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU? THE ONLY POINT THAT I CAN FIGURE OUT IS TO GO THROUGH IT AND HAVE IT, WHICH MEANS HAVE THE PAIN AND HAVE WHATEVER IT IS, AND THEN YOU GET PAST IT. IF YOU DON'T GO THROUGH IT YOU CAN'T GO PAST IT. IF YOU DON'T ALLOW IT TO ALL HAPPEN THEN YOU TRY TO STOP IT OR YOU TRY TO PRETEND IT'S NOT HAPPENING OR YOU TRY TO AVOID WHATEVER IT IS FROM HAPPENING AND THE RESULT IS THAT YOU NEVER HAVE IT AND IN A SENSE YOU NEVER HAVE THE DEEPEST ASPECT OF THE PAIN OF IT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WHAT YOU NEVER HAVE IS THE RELEASE THAT COMES FROM HAVING GONE THROUGH IT AND COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE. AND I REALLY THINK IT'S ABOUT COMING OUT THE OTHER SIDE, YOU KNOW? YEAH, I LIKE TO THINK IT'S ABOUT COMING OUT THE OTHER SIDE BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF TIMES WHEN I FEEL LIKE THERE'S NO OTHER SIDE. LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE. THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL TO US! SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A ROMANTIC WEEKEND AND NOW WE'RE IN THE KITCHEN AND I DON'T WANT TO BE A MAID! I JUST KEEP HAVING THESE PAINS AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO GO ANYWHERE AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO CHANGE AND I WEAR OUT THE PEOPLE THAT I CAN TELL ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY BORING. IT'S NOT BORING. IT'S PRETTY BORING. IT'S INFURIATING, IT'S NOT BORING. YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS BEING IN PAIN. I KNOW, I AGREE. YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL AND BRILLIANT AND YOU SHOULD BE HAVING A WONDERFUL LIFE. I KNOW. WELL, HAVE A WONDERFUL FUCKING LIFE! I'M FINE NOW, I'M HAVING A WONDERFUL LIFE. I'M OKAY NOW, YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW WHAT THE AMAZING THING ABOUT YOU IS? NOTHING FRIGHTENS YOU. NO OVERWHELMING ODDS EVER FRIGHTEN YOU. YOU ALWAYS RISE TO IT. AND THE SMALLEST THINGS JUST CRUSH ME AND MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO GO OUT THE DOOR OR PICK UP THE PHONE OR TALK TO ANYBODY. IT'S PART OF ROMANCE TO DO THIS! I SEE YOU IN THE KITCHEN EVERY NIGHT! I SEE YOU IN THE KITCHEN EVERY DAY! I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU IN A RESTAURANT FOR A CHANGE! WHOA! CAN I BE OF ANY ASSISTANCE HERE? UH, YEAH, YOU COULD TAKE THAT IN THERE. IS EVERYTHING ALRIGHT HERE? TERRIFIC, YEAH. SO WHO YOU FUCKING? I'M FUCKING, UM... YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO I'M FUCKING? NO, I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHO YOU'RE FUCKING. OKAY. ARE YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME? YOU WANT TO KNOW IF I'M HAVING A GOOD TIME? NO, I DON'T WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'RE HAVING A GOOD TIME. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO I'M FUCKING? WHO ARE YOU FUCKING? YOU WANT TO KNOW, HUH? YOU FUCKER, YOU WANT TO KNOW. * * A FINE ROMANCE WITH NO KISSES * * A FINE ROMANCE, MY FRIEND THIS IS * * WE SHOULD BE LIKE A COUPLE OF HOT TOMATOES * * BUT YOU'RE AS COLD AS YESTERDAY'S * * MASHED POTATOES * A FINE ROMANCE, YOU WON'T NESTLE * * A FINE ROMANCE, YOU WON'T WRESTLE * WHAT? I WANT TO HAVE A GOOD TIME, THAT'S ALL. I WANT YOU TO GO OUT WITH ME, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? LET'S GO OUT. I'D LIKE TO GET A NIGHTCAP SOMEWHERE. YOU WANT A LITTLE MORE WINE? I'D LIKE TO GO OUT. IT'S THE WEEKEND, IT'S THE TIME TO GO OUT AND MAKE WHOOPEE AND HAVE SOME FUN. YOU MAKE WHOOPEE EVERY WEEKEND? NO, THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT. YOU WERE GOING TO COME DOWN FOR THE WEEKEND, RIGHT? I KNOW BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO GO OUT. WHAT IS THIS GOING OUT? WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE PARTY RIGHT HERE! DO WE GET COUPONS IF WE SCORE? I'D LIKE THAT LAMP. WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU GUYS? I'D JUST LIKE TO GET A DIFFERENT, UM... WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? I'VE BEEN STUCK IN A HOUSE FOR TWO YEARS WITH A BABY. I WANT TO GET OUT. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO. THEN DO IT. DON'T COMPLAIN AND WHINE ABOUT IT. I'M NOT WHINING ABOUT IT. I'M JUST TELLING YOU I'VE BEEN OVER DOMESTICATED FOR TWO YEARS, UP THERE WITH A BABY WITH NOTHING TO DO, WITH NO FRIENDS. YOU ARE OUR ONLY FRIENDS. AND NOW I'D JUST LIKE TO GO OUT AND DO SOMETHING. IF WE ARE YOUR ONLY FRIENDS AND NOW YOU'VE GOT US AGAIN AS FRIENDS, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT? I WANT TO GET OUT. GO AND HAVE A GREAT TIME. SEE YA LATER. HAVE FUN. * THIS IS A FINE ROMANCE * * OH, BOY, WHAT A ROMANCE * HE'S NEVER LEFT ME LIKE THIS. ALRIGHT, SO, YOU CONCEN- CAN YOU SHUT UP? OKAY? ALRIGHT, DO YOU- SHUT UP! SHUTTING UP IS GOOD. SORRY. HE'S JUST CRAZY. HI! HI! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M TAKING MY BATH. WHAT'S THAT STUFF YOU'RE PUTTING ON? CHOCOLATE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, CHOCOLATE? YOU'RE TAKING A BATH IN CHOCOLATE? CHOCOLATE HAS A CHEMICAL IN IT CALLED PHENYLETHYLAMINE AND IT'S THE SAME CHEMICAL THAT'S PRODUCED IN THE BRAIN WHEN YOU'RE IN A STATE OF BEING IN LOVE. I SEE. THE NEW YORK PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE HAS DONE STUDIES ON IT AND THEY'VE PROVEN THIS. THEY'VE PROVEN THAT IF YOU HAVE CHOCOLATE IN YOUR SYSTEM IT SIMULATES THE SAME STATE OF BEING IN LOVE. IT PRODUCES THAT CHEMICAL IN THE BRAIN. IT PRODUCES THE STATE OF BEING IN LOVE. IT'S LIKE BEING IN LOVE. WHY DON'T YOU EAT IT? WHY DON'T YOU JUST EAT IT? AND GET FAT? PIMPLES? THIS WAY YOU'RE IN HOT WATER, THE PORES OF YOUR SKIN OPEN UP, YOU JUST ABSORB IT THROUGH THE SKIN. IT'S MY LOVE BATH. IT'S MY LOVE BATH. LUCY... IT'S MY LOVE BATH. HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU ABOUT HOPPY THE MARVEL BUNNY? YES. HOPPY THE MARVEL BUNNY WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. BECAUSE AS OPPOSED TO ALL THOSE OTHER- HOPPY THE MARVEL BUNNY SAID "SHAZAM". HE WAS JUST THIS REGULAR KID RABBIT LIKE YOU AND ME AND THEN HE SAID "SHAZAM" AND HE BECAME HOPPY THE MARVEL BUNNY AND HE WAS ABLE TO BEAT UP ALL THE BAD ANIMALS IN THE KINGDOM WHO WERE BULLYING ALL THE POOR VULNERABLE LITTLE ANIMALS WHO WERE BEING HURT BY OTHER PEOPLE AND BEING MISTREATED. AND HE WAS ABLE TO BE, UM... HE WAS ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM AND HE HAD HIS LITTLE GIRL BUNNY THAT HE COULD REALLY TAKE CARE OF. AND WHEN HE SAID "SHAZAM" HE BECAME MARVEL BUNNY AND HE COULD FLY THROUGH THE AIR AND FIGHT LIKE CAPTAIN MARVEL OR ANY OF THE MARVEL FAMILY. SEEING YOU IS FUCKING ME UP A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE IT OPENS UP ALL THAT SHIT. UNLESS WE FIGURE OUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WANT TO DO. DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE WANT TO DO? WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SIGN A DIVORCE AGREEMENT. MONDAY. THAT WEIRD GUY WOULDN'T TAKE OUR- HE WOULDN'T DO IT. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM? CAN YOU KISS ME OR WHAT? I GOT YOUR NOSE. YOU'RE DRUNK. SO I'M DRUNK, THAT'S NO REASON NOT TO HAVE A LITTLE SEX. YOU WANT TO GO FOR SEX OR YOU WANT TO GO FOR BASIC EMOTIONAL HOW ARE YA, HOW ARE YOU DOING, THIS IS US REMEMBERING THE PAST KIND OF SHIT. I WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT SOME MORE. YOU MEAN THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR SEX THEN? I DON'T KNOW. REMEMBER WHEN YOU CAME TO VISIT ME IN NEW YORK? WE HAD SOME PRETTY GOOD SEX. I REMEMBER THAT. THAT WAS PRETTY WEIRD. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. I GUESS YOU DIDN'T. NO, I DIDN'T. I'M SORRY. THERE'S NOTHING FOR YOU TO BE SORRY ABOUT, BABY. NOTHING FOR YOU TO BE SORRY ABOUT AT ALL. I'M LOADED, AREN'T I? MAYBE SEX IS NOT A GOOD IDEA WHEN LOADED AFTER ALL THIS TIME, YOU KNOW? MAYBE. BUT SEX SOMETIMES IS PRETTY GOOD WHEN LOADED, YOU KNOW? ON THE OTHER HAND IT BECOMES SORT OF AN ILLUSION OF SEX, AN ILLUSION OF GOOD SEX 'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK WENT ON 'CAUSE YOU'RE LOADED. THAT'S OKAY, THOUGH. AS LONG AS YOU'RE LOCKED INTO THE ILLUSION. I THINK THAT'S A CUE FOR ME TO HAVE A LITTLE SEX WITH YOU. NOT NECESSARILY, WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT. HOW ABOUT A LITTLE BEAUJOLAIS? YOU WANT MORE BEAUJOLAIS? NO, I'VE HAD ENOUGH BEAUJOLAIS. I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE FUCK'S GOING ON. THIS HAS BEEN THE WEIRDEST COUPLE OF DAYS. AND NOW WE GOT TOMORROW, YOU KNOW? THE 4TH OF JULY. 4TH OF JULY AND A HOUSE FULL OF NUTS. YEAH, THEY'RE ALL WEIRDOS. MY SISTER'S OUT OF HER MIND. LUCY AND EDDIE ARE COMPLETELY BONKERS. EVERYBODY'S CRAZY. EXCEPT YOU AND ME OR I'M NOT SURE ABOUT YOU I THINK IS THE OLD PHRASE. I'M NOT SURE ABOUT ME, I'M NOT SURE ABOUT YOU EITHER, BY THE WAY. I'M NOT NUTS, YOU KNOW THAT. I'M THE SANEST ONE YOU'RE EVER GONNA MEET. HOW ABOUT KISSING ME? I'M FUCKING- I'M JUST WANTING A KISS. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. IS THIS THE START OF SEX? REMEMBER SEX? I REMEMBER. IS THIS THE START OF IT? I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO HERE. NO, SEX IS NO ANSWER. I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHAT YOU FEEL. I USED TO WALK THROUGH THIS HOUSE SAYING "DON'T LEAVE ME, PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME. DON'T GO AWAY, PLEASE." AFTER YOU WERE GONE I'D WALK AROUND SAYING "HELP! HELP!" OUT LOUD TO MYSELF. I WAS SAYING "ARE YOU THERE? ANYBODY THERE?" "ARE YOU THERE? WHERE IS EVERYBODY?" "I'M ALONE HERE IN THIS HOUSE." "I'M ALONE ON THIS BOARDWALK." OH, BABY. YOU'RE MORE OKAY THAN ANYONE I KNOW. YOU'RE THE MOST OKAY. YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO BE OKAY ALONE. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN BEING OKAY ALONE. I DON'T BELIEVE IN BEING OKAY ALONE. THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS BEING OKAY ALONE. I THINK SHARING IS BEING OKAY. I ONLY UNDERSTAND ABOUT SHARING, YOU KNOW? WITHOUT SHARING I FEEL IT'S A PRISON SENTENCE. SOME KIND OF INDETERMINATE PRISON SENTENCE THAT YOU WALK AROUND AS IF YOU'RE FREE BUT REALLY YOU'RE UNDER SOME KIND OF EMOTIONAL LOCK AND KEY, YOU KNOW, AND YOU JUST WALK AROUND AND WALK AROUND AND YOU GOTTA REPORT BACK TO THE WARDEN, YOU KNOW? I FELT THAT FOR SO LONG. I DO KNOW. I DON'T EVER WANT TO FEEL THAT AGAIN. HI. FIND WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR? OH, IT WAS HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE BARS, I TALKED TO NO ONE. IT WAS RIDICULOUS. IT WAS NOISY. WHERE IS EVERYBODY? ASLEEP. YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO SLEEP? NO, NOT YET. WELL, I GUESS I'LL GO TO SLEEP. ALL ALONE? OH, IT'S NOT EXACTLY ALL ALONE. BECAUSE LUCY'S UP THERE. SO IT'S NOT EXACTLY ALL ALONE. BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHERE YOU WANT TO GO EITHER, IS IT? I'VE REALLY THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THAT. IT'S NOT HARD TO THINK ABOUT. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. I, UH... YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN MARRIED A VERY LONG TIME AND, UH, I HAVEN'T REALLY, UH... I'M NOT GETTING A SENTENCE OUT. I'M FEELING REALLY RIDICULOUS NOW. UMM... ARE YOU SAYING, UM, WHAT I THINK YOU'RE SAYING? YOU ARE SAYING WHAT I THINK YOU'RE SAYING. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT YOU WERE SAYING. I WASN'T SURE WHAT YOU WERE SAYING BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE SAYING THAT. RIGHT HERE? ON THE FLOOR? LOOK, I'M SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT. IT'S ALRIGHT, I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND GET A COUPLE OF DRINKS. DON'T! PEOPLE ARE DOWN THERE! WE'RE GUESTS IN A HOUSE! WE'LL DO IT TONIGHT, WE'LL DO IT TONIGHT. I GOTTA HAVE MY COFFEE. IN THE MORNING IS THE BEST, YOU'RE MORE RELAXED IN THE MORNING. NO, I'M HUNGRY IN THE MORNING. I'M RELAXED AT NIGHT. YOU'LL BE HUNGRIER AFTERWARDS. YOU KNOW HOW YOU GET AFTERWARDS, COME ON. NO, LOOK, I GOTTA GO. I GOTTA GO. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU HAVE TO GO? SHH, THEY'RE DOWN THERE. THEY'RE GONNA HEAR THINGS. BELIEVE ME, MEN LIKE IT BETTER IN THE MORNING. I'M A MAN, I KNOW WHAT I LIKE. TOUCH ME. NO, IF I TOUCH YOU YOU'LL GET STARTED. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, I'M STARTED, COME ON. I GOTTA GO, I GOTTA GO. DON'T GO! I GOTTA GO! LOOK, WE'LL DO IT TONIGHT. I GOTTA GO. LOOK, LOOK, LOOK. WE'LL DO IT TONIGHT, WE'LL DO IT TONIGHT. I PROMISE YOU. WE'LL DO IT TONIGHT. * * I DON'T BELONG HERE ANYMORE. WHERE DO YOU BELONG IF YOU DON'T BELONG HERE? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T THINK I BELONG ANYWHERE ANYMORE. REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE KIDS AND IT WAS ALL SO GOOD AND EVERYBODY WAS SO HAPPY, THE FAMILY WAS SO WHOLE? IT WAS SO PERFECT. AND THEN IT JUST GOT... IT GOT... WHAT? IT GOT HARD, EVERYTHING GOT HARD AND IT DOESN'T GET ANY EASIER. I'M SORRY. WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT IT? I WANT YOU TO BE OKAY. I WANT YOU TO BE OKAY. HOW ABOUT BOTH? OKAY. SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? WHAT ABOUT SEEING OTHER MEN? I SEE SOMEBODY. DO YOU? HOW'S THAT? IT'S OKAY. HE'S A BABY. THIS ONE ISN'T A BABY? THIS ONE'S A GROWNUP. I'M NOT A GROWNUP, THOUGH. I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU'RE A GROWNUP. THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN A BABY. LET'S GO IN. HEAD FIRST. OKAY! THIS IS THE BEST IDEA. BEING HERE WITH YOU NOW IN THE GARDEN LIKE THIS, IT'S LIKE THIS WAS ALL SOME WEIRD HORRIBLE DREAM AND WE'RE BACK HERE AND IT NEVER REALLY HAPPENED. AND WE JUST IMAGINED THAT WHOLE TWO YEAR INSANITY. MAYBE IT WAS A DREAM? I DON'T KNOW. IF IT WAS A DREAM THEN EVERYTHING'S OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN DREAMS? YOU WAKE UP. NO, YOU DON'T WAKE UP. NOT MY DREAMS, YOU HAVE HAPPY ENDINGS 'CAUSE MY DREAMS COME FROM COMIC BOOKS AND OLD SONGS. SHAZAM. YOU KNOW? I USED TO UNDERSTAND HAPPY. I KNOW THAT I USED TO BE HAPPY. I WAS REALLY HAPPY. BUT... I'M HAPPY NOW AND I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE HAPPY. I ONLY REMEMBER... I DON'T REMEMBER. I DON'T REMEMBER. I REMEMBER BEING HAPPY ONLY IN COMPARISON TO NOT BEING HAPPY, WHICH IS WHAT I AM NOW. I FORGET HAPPY WHEN I'M SAD, I FORGET EVERYTHING WHEN I AM WHERE I AM. I'M TOTALLY SUBJECTIVE ABOUT MY FEELINGS. YOU REMEMBER BEING HAPPY IN THIS HOUSE? I REMEMBER BEING HAPPY HERE. YOU REMEMBER BEING SAD HERE? I REMEMBER BEING SAD HERE. I GUESS THAT'S IT, HUH? MAYBE I WANT TOO MUCH. MAYBE YOU JUST GET A BALANCE. A LITTLE PLEASURE, A LITTLE PAIN, THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME. IS THAT NOT GOOD ENOUGH? SO FAR IT HASN'T BEEN GOOD ENOUGH. I REALLY WOULD LOVE TO ACCEPT THAT THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH. IF I COULD ACCEPT THAT I COULD BE HAPPY. DOES LOVING FEEL GOOD? OR DOES LOVING HURT? SEEMS TO ME THERE'S A LOT OF HURT IN IT. SEEMS TO ME BEING HAPPY IS NOT LOOKING, YOU KNOW, NOT KNOWING. THAT'S HAPPY. YOU PAY TOO CLOSE ATTENTION IT'S KIND OF HARD TO BE HAPPY. SO THERE'S A LOT OF PAIN. IT'S OKAY, BABY. * A CIGARETTE THAT BEARS A LIPSTICK'S TRACES * * AN AIRLINE TICKET TO ROMANTIC PLACES * * A FAIRGROUND'S PAINTED SWINGS * * THESE FOOLISH THINGS REMIND ME OF YOU * * A TINKLING PIANO IN THE NEXT APARTMENT * * THOSE STUMBLING WORDS * * THAT TOLD YOU WHAT MY HEART MEANT * * OH, HOW THE GHOST OF YOU CLINGS * HI, CAN I HELP YOU? YES, MY DRIVEWAY'S BLOCKED. THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF TRAFFIC IN HERE. YEAH, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE. IS THAT DAVID OUT THERE? SURE, COME ON. ARE YOU DAVID'S WIFE? YEAH. NICE TO MEET YOU. I DIDN'T KNOW DAVID WAS MARRIED. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? FORGET IT. EXCUSE ME. HI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE GET-TOGETHER HERE. ARE WE MAKING TOO MUCH NOISE? NO, MY DRIVEWAY IS BLOCKED. THERE'S SOME KIND OF AN ICE CREAM THING- IS IT A CAR OR THE ICE CREAM TRUCK THAT'S BLOCKING YOU? THERE'S A CAR INSIDE MY DRIVEWAY AND AN ICE CREAM TRUCK OUTSIDE MY DRIVEWAY. WHAT KIND OF CAR? (VARIOUS CONVERSATIONS) THIS IS MY NEIGHBOR, THIS IS MY BROTHER, NICKY. I'M GLAD YOU COULD COME BY. I WOULD HAVE INVITED YOU BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU WERE HOME THIS WEEKEND. HAPPY 4TH OF JULY, BY THE WAY. MAXWELL, GET THE TRUCK OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY. YOU'RE BLOCKING THIS MAN'S DRIVEWAY. HE'LL GET IT OUT. RELAX AND HAVE A BEER OR SOMETHING. I DON'T EVEN DRINK BEER FOR CHRIST SAKES. CAN I GET A 7-UP OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? WHO ARE YOU GUYS? HELLO? THEY JUST CAME IN AND WE'RE GIVING THEM SOMETHING TO EAT. HI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WE WERE JUST DRIVING DOWN THE STREET. WE CAME FROM A PARTY AND IT WAS KIND OF A BORE. I THINK THEY'RE SAFE. WHERE DO YOU LIVE? NEXT DOOR. I'VE BEEN AROUND HERE A LOT, I NEVER NOTICED YOU BEFORE. WHAT ARE YOU, A DETECTIVE OR SOMETHING? NO, BUT I'M A REASONABLY OBSERVANT PERSON. I THINK WE'RE IN THE SAME BAND AS TRAVELING MUSICIANS IN THE 14TH CENTURY OR SOMETHING. IT'S A HECK OF A 4TH OF JULY YOU GOT GOING HERE. WHO'S GOT GOING? IT'S NOT MY PARTY. IT'S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY, I DON'T CARE ANYTHING ABOUT THE 4TH OF JULY. HAVE YOU GOT AN ACCENT? YEAH. YOU'RE A FOREIGNER. I WOULDN'T EXACTLY SAY THAT. WHAT ARE YOU, AN ALIEN? WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE I COME FROM? IS THIS YOUR FAMILY? NO, THEY'RE JUST FRIENDS. YEAH? WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO? HE'S A NICE GUY. DON'T TALK TO ANYBODY ELSE. EAT THIS. THANKS, HONEY. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT JULY 4TH. IF THAT HOLIDAY DISAPPEARS FROM AMERICA, AMERICA DISAPPEARS. THAT AND THANKSGIVING. IT'S THAT IMPORTANT. WHAT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT IS MY REACTION TO THAT HOLIDAY. IF YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE HERE YOU MIGHT AS WELL THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. YOU GET SOME DECENT JULY 4TH FOOD, TOO, 'CAUSE THIS IS SHIT. MAKE HIM A MARSHMALLOW, HONEY. LIKE, WHEN WE'RE IN BED TOGETHER, YOU KNOW, AND I DO THINGS TO MYSELF WHILE WE'RE MAKING LOVE, HE RESENTS IT. HE SAYS TO ME "I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO THAT, IS 2ND BATTALION COMING IN NOW?" (VARIOUS CONVERSATIONS) DON'T TALK TO HIM ANYMORE! PEGGY? PEGGY? PEG? LISTEN TO THIS: SOME WOMEN CAN CONTROL THE PENIS TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THEY CAN FLIP THE HEAD AGAINST THE CERVIX TO AMPLIFY THE PLEASURABLE SENSATIONS TO AN EXTREME. SOME MANUALS POINT OUT THAT YOU CAN ROTATE 180 DEGREES AND FACE HIS FEET BUT MANY MEN FEEL THEY CAN'T SEE OR TOUCH AS MUCH, SO AS ONE MAN PUT IT "THIS IS WASTED EFFORT". DO YOU BELIEVE THIS? YOU KNOW, THERE WAS THIS RABBI IN THE NINTH CENTURY WHO PROMULGATED A BAN AGAINST POLYGAMY AND, UM, THIS THOUSAND YEAR BAN IS GOING TO EXPIRE IN THREE YEARS AND I'M GOING TO MAKE A TEST CASE LEGALLY HERE IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE THERE'S NO RABBINICAL AUTHORITY THAT'S AUTHORIZED OR ABLE TO EXTEND THIS BAN FURTHER- BAN AGAINST WHAT? AGAINST JEWS ENGAGING IN POLYGAMY. I'M GOING TO MARRY SEVERAL WOMEN SIMULTANEOUSLY AND SAY IT'S A MATTER OF MY RELIGIOUS CONSCIENCE AS A JEW. THAT OUGHTA BRING YOU A LOT OF SUCCESS IN THIS COUNTRY. EXCUSE ME. MY NAME'S SAM LUCAS, I LIVE NEXT DOOR. WHAT ARE YOU READING? WHO WAS THAT GUY WHO WAS CHASING AFTER US? OH, HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE. MAXWELL. MAXWELL? YOU'RE KIDDING. THE LAST MAXWELL I KNEW WAS IN FIRST GRADE. I DIDN'T NAME HIM, YOU KNOW. THE LAST MAXWELL I KNEW WAS GOD. I'M SERIOUS! HOW'S YOUR WIFE? MY WIFE'S FINE. YOU KNOW WE JUST CELEBRATED OUR 25TH ANNIVERSARY. YOU WERE BABIES WHEN YOU GOT MARRIED, HUH? "HOW TO MAKE LOVE TO A MAN"? YES. I NEVER READ A BOOK LIKE THIS. (LAUGHING) IF YOU CAN ONLY ACCEPT THE FACT THAT YOU WILL NEVER, EVER KNOW ANOTHER PERSON THEN THAT NOT KNOWING, THAT ACCEPTANCE CAN BE LIKE THE ONE BRIDGE BETWEEN YOU, THE ONE THING THAT YOU CAN KNOW FOR SURE. IS YOUR HUSBAND HERE? YEAH. WHICH ONE IS HE? AT THE BARBECUE. LOOK, UH... BOOKS ARE GOOD, I GOT NOTHING AGAINST BOOKS. BUT THERE'S A CERTAIN KIND OF EXPERIENCE THAT YOU ACQUIRE EVEN WITH A STRANGER THAT WOULD BE MORE HELPFUL, MORE HELPFUL THAN A BOOK. WELL... I'M NOT PITCHING, I'M JUST... I LOVE IT, I MEAN, IT'S FLATTERING. LOOK, UH... WHY DON'T WE GO? FOR INSTANCE, TAKE THIS PARTY. EVERYONE'S COMING IN HERE THIS AFTERNOON, THEY'RE SEEING THE SAME POOL, THE SAME TREES, THE SAME BRICKS, BUT IN FACT EVERY SINGLE PERSON SEES SOMETHING DIFFERENT. NO ONE SEES THE SAME THING. I'M GLAD YOU GUYS STOPPED BY. ME TOO! DEMMY WAS READY TO BAIL ON ME AND I SAW THE FLAMES AND SMOKE AND I SAID "LET'S GET SOME FOOD, DUDE". (LAUGHTER) IT IS A LITTLE FRIGHTENING. I DON'T KNOW IF SHE LOVES ME. DO YOU LOVE HER? SHE GIVES ME A HARD TIME. OF COURSE I'M A SUCKER FOR A HARD TIME. ARE YOU HAPPY? UM, IT'S A LITTLE SCARY TO PUT SO MUCH OF YOUR SELF IMAGE INTO SOMEONE THAT YOU'RE NOT THAT SURE OF. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN JUST PICK UP AND LEAVE, YOU KNOW. A TREE DOESN'T ASK ITSELF "AM I HAPPY?" A FLOWER DOESN'T ASK ITSELF "AM I HAPPY?" IT IS, IT IS. I'VE GOT A FANTASTIC LIBRARY. IF YOU FEEL LIKE READING SOMETHING COME JOIN ME, OKAY? A ROCK'S THERE. SHE CLAIMS THAT SHE'S DISSATISFIED, SHE WANTS IT TO BE MORE, SHE WANTS IT TO BE MAGICAL - YOU KNOW, THE ORGASM IS NOT WHAT SHE WANTS... I DON'T KNOW. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? OF COURSE SHE'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE GOOD ORGASMS. I AGREE. WELL, MAKE SURE YOU GIVE 'EM TO HER. IS THERE A SPECIAL TECHNIQUE? WHAT IS REALITY? DO YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN IN EVERY FORM OF THERAPY EXCEPT FOR GETTING INTO AN ORGONE BOX AND I STILL DON'T KNOW. FIRST OF ALL, DO YOU DO IT LONG ENOUGH? WELL, HOW LONG IS LONG ENOUGH? WELL, TELL ME HOW LONG YOU DO IT ON THE AVERAGE. HOW LONG YOU'RE HAVING ACTUAL INTERCOURSE FROM THE MOMENT OF INSERTION TIL THE MOMENT OF YOUR ORGASM. WELL, IT DEPENDS. YEAH, I KNOW. WHAT'S THE SHORTEST TIME? THE SHORTEST TIME IS TOO SHORT, THIS I KNOW. WHAT'S THE LONGEST TIME? THE LONGEST TIME CAN BE 20 MINUTES. WELL, THE LONGEST IS 20 TOO SHORT. (LAUGHING) AH, SHIT. THERE'S NO MAN HERE THAT YOU'RE INVOLVED WITH? YOU'RE THE ONLY MAN I'M INVOLVED WITH. BUT THE POINT IS THAT SINCE WOMEN HAVE MULTIPLE ORGASMS AND THEY CAN HAVE THEM WITH EVER INCREASING INTENSITY YOU SHOULD DO IT LONG ENOUGH FOR THEM- SIXTY MINUTES? YEAH, THAT'S A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME. LIKE BARELY REASONABLE OR ADEQUATELY REASONABLE? IT'S ADEQUATELY REASONABLE. HOW ABOUT 40 MINUTES? IT'S NOT A MATTER OF LOGGING THE TIME, 40 MINUTES COULD BE OKAY. LET'S FACE IT, IF EVERYBODY AT THIS PARTY WERE THEIR GRANDPARENTS THEY'D PROBABLY BE SO BUSY OUT IN THE FIELDS, TILLING THE FIELDS AND PICKING THE LEMONS AND WORKING THE GROUND, THERE WAS NO TIME TO WORRY ABOUT LOVE AND MARRIAGE AND RELATIONSHIPS. THEY'D BE TOO TIRED. I REALLY MEAN IT, OKAY? I LOVE YOU, ALRIGHT? I GET WORRIED. NOW GO GET YOUR CAR. SHE'S NEVER... I NEVER KNOW WHERE SHE'LL BE, UH, TOMORROW AND THAT'S EXCITING. AND IT'S FRIGHTENING, AND, UH... AND I DON'T GET IT. WHOA, DEM. YOU'RE BURNING THE POT, MAN. PEGGY, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. WHAT'S THE MATTER? HI, JUDY. YOU CAME HERE WITH SOMEONE, YOU KNOW? YEAH? COME AND TALK TO HIM, PLEASE. PEGGY, COME ON! DID SOMETHING HAPPEN? YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOU WERE WITH ANYBODY. WHAT? WHAT'S THE MATTER? COME ON, IT'S THE 4TH OF JULY! YOU WANT A SPARKLER? WHAT IS IT? DON'T DO THIS. THERE'S NOTHING TO GET SAD ABOUT. COME ON, YOU WANT SOME? COME ON. YOU USED TO SMOKE IT ALL THE TIME. YOU DON'T WANT IT? JUDY! JUDY, WE'RE NOT GONNA HURT HER. SHE'LL BE FINE. OH, WELL. SHE USED TO HAVE A GOOD TIME. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED. HI. HI! I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU. DID YOU HAVE ONE OF YOUR LITTLE GAS ATTACKS? OH... YEAH, I DID. FEEL BETTER? I FEEL MUCH BETTER, THANKS. HOW ARE YOU? GOOD. EVERYBODY LOVES THE BARBECUE. I BET, IT WAS JUST WONDERFUL. THOSE HAMBURGERS ARE GOING LIKE HOTCAKES. YOU DID A GREAT JOB. THANKS. I'M GOING BACK TO IT NOW. CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING? NO, I'M FINE. HOTDOG, HAMBURGER? LIFE IS LIKE A STONE. YOU RUB IT, YOU RUB IT, YOU GO OVER THESE QUESTIONS OVER AND OVER. YOU RUB AND YOU RUB AND THEN JUST AS YOU THINK YOU'RE GETTING THIS MUCH. IT DIES. * SEE THE SUNBEAMS? EVERY ONE BEAMS * * JUST BECAUSE OF YOU * * LOVE'S IN SESSION AND MY DEPRESSION * * IS UNMISTAKABLY THROUGH * * OH, THINGS ARE LOOKING UP * * IT'S A GREAT LITTLE WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN * * OH, I'M HAPPY AS A PUP * * SINCE LOVE LOOKED UP AT ME * * REMEMBER, BABY, WHEN WE USED TO LIVE UP THERE? REMEMBER? I REMEMBER. YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE LOOKED DOWN HERE AND SAW OURSELVES LIVING HERE IN THE FUTURE? OW! BABY, WHY DO YOU KEEP BITING ME? YOU'RE GOOD TO BITE. I TASTE GOOD? YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS, DON'T YOU? WE'RE THE SAME SPECIES. I KEEP TRYING TO TELL YOU WE'RE THE SAME SPECIES AND THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF US ON THIS PLANET. I KNOW THAT. HAVE YOU FOUND A LOT OF US OUT THERE? UH UH. I HAVEN'T EITHER. SO YOU KNOW SPECIES, YOU KNOW WHAT THE LAW OF NATURE IS. SPECIES LOOK AND FIND EACH OTHER AND THEN EAT EACH OTHER UP. CAN WE GO TO BED NOW? I'M GOING HOME NOW. NO, WE'RE GOING TO BED NOW. NO, I'M GOING HOME. NO, WE'RE GONNA GO TO BED NOW. YOU WERE ALWAYS LIKE THIS. I'M STILL LIKE THIS. I KNOW. MAYBE WE SHOULD START AGAIN. WE SHOULD START ALL OVER AGAIN. WE SHOULD SEE IF WE CAN RENT 7H UP AT THE CHATEAU, YOU'LL MOVE IN WITH ME, WE'D LOOK OUT THE WINDOW, GO OUT ON OUR BALCONY, SEE THIS HOUSE DOWN HERE, COUPLE YEARS LATER WE MOVE INTO THIS HOUSE, COUPLE YEARS LATER WE GET MARRIED IN THIS HOUSE. THEN I TRY TO REWRITE THE ENDING. AREN'T YOU HAPPY RIGHT THIS SECOND? RIGHT THIS SECOND? YOU ARE, RIGHT? RIGHT THIS SECOND? THE SECOND CHANGED THREE TIMES. EACH ONE OF THOSE SECONDS YOU WERE HAPPY. I WAS OKAY. NO, YOU WERE HAPPY. I WAS PRETTY GOOD. YOU WERE MORE THAN PRETTY GOOD, YOU WERE HAPPY. BEFORE YOU STARTED THINKING ABOUT IT YOU WERE HAPPY. YEAH, YEAH, THERE'S THAT... OKAY, I'LL GIVE YOU THAT. THAT... THAT'S ENOUGH, DON'T THINK ABOUT IT. JUST DON'T THINK ABOUT IT AND GO TO SLEEP. NO, I WANT TO BE AWAKE, I WANT TO UNDERSTAND, I WANT TO KNOW IT. I WANT TO NOTICE IT. WHAT'S TO NOTICE? THE POOL, THE PEOPLE, THE HOUSE, OUR LIFE. IT'S BEAUTIFUL, IT'S ENOUGH. IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO GET ANY BETTER. THIS IS IT. WHAT DO YOU THINK THERE IS? I DON'T KNOW. BUT YOU THINK IT IS SOMETHING? I DON'T KNOW. IF IT'S NOTHING I WANT TO KNOW IT. I'M TELLING YOU IT'S NOTHING. I CAN'T TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT, OBVIOUSLY. BUT IT'S EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? NOTHING IS EVERYTHING AND IT'S SUFFICIENT? THAT'S A LOT OF ABSTRACT WORD STUFF. IT'S REALITY. IT'S NOT A PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE, THOSE WORDS. I WANT TO KNOW IT. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW? I DON'T KNOW. JUST KNOW THIS - THIS MOMENT, THIS SECOND. KNOW IT. GOT IT. FREEZE IT. GOT IT. THERE'S ONLY A SEQUENCE OF THESE, BABY. GOT IT, GOT IT, GOT IT. WELL, THERE'S NO ANSWERS NOW, DARLING GIRL. THERE'S NO ANSWERS. THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE. * * YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU COME TO SIGN A DIVORCE AGREEMENT? WE DIDN'T SIGN THE DIVORCE AGREEMENT. NO, WE DIDN'T BUT WE'RE GOING TO, ARE WE, TOMORROW? WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TOMORROW. * * HAPPY 4TH OF JULY! HAPPY 4TH OF JULY! * I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO LAST A LIFETIME. WHY DIDN'T IT LAST A LIFETIME? I DON'T UNDERSTAND. BABY? I DON'T UNDERSTAND EITHER. IT WAS YOUR CHOICE, RIGHT? NOT MY CHOICE. THERE WERE LOTS OF REASONS WHY IT COULDN'T LAST. WHY? I DON'T UNDERSTAND. TELL ME. I WAS TOO YOUNG. THE TIMES WERE TOO HARD. I SUBMERGED MYSELF IN YOUR LIFE. I DID SUBMERGE MYSELF IN YOUR LIFE. I THOUGHT IT WAS OUR LIFE. I WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH FOR IT. I'M SORRY. I LOVE YOU. YOU DO? I LOVE YOU TOO, BABY. SEE? * * I WAS ONLY PASSING BY * * AND THEN YOU CAUGHT MY EYE * * WHAT A THRILL MY HEART AND I STOOD STILL * * LUCKY FOR ME THAT YOU CAME STROLLING INTO VIEW * * I TOOK ONE LOOK AND KNEW YOU WERE LOVE PASSING BY * * I TOOK ONE LOOK AND KNEW YOU WERE LOVE PASSING BY * * DARLING, I NEVER DREAMED THAT I'D DISCOVER * * A PASSERBY WOULD BE MY LOVER * * FROM NOW ON WE'LL WALK TOGETHER * * AND THE WORLD WILL SEEM SO GRAND * * AS WE GO HAND IN HAND * * YOU AND I PASSING BY * * DARLING, I NEVER DREAMED THAT I'D DISCOVER * * A PASSERBY WOULD BE MY LOVER * * FROM NOW ON WE'LL WALK TOGETHER * * AND THE WORLD WILL SEEM SO GRAND * * AS WE GO HAND IN HAND * * YOU AND I PASSING BY * HAPPY ENDING, BABY. HAPPY ENDING. WHEN I WAS A KID IN SUMMER CAMP WE HAD THIS CONTEST WHO COULD STAY UNDER THE WATER LONGEST. I WAS VERY BAD AT CONTESTS, I NEVER WON ANY CONTESTS. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY BASEBALL VERY WELL AND I COULDN'T RUN VERY FAST AND I WAS SCARED OF A LOT OF THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, BUT ONE THING I KNEW WAS I COULD STAY UNDER WATER LONGER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE BECAUSE I WAS WILLING TO DROWN IF NECESSARY. YOU SEE, THE CONTEST WAS EVERYBODY GOES DOWN, 1-2-3, UNDER THE WATER. AND I WENT 1-2-3 UNDER THE WATER AND I STUCK MY HEAD UNDER THAT LITTLE METAL LADDER THAT THEY HAD THAT TAKES YOU OUT OF THE WATER, YOU KNOW? AND I PUT MY HEAD UNDER THE BOTTOM RUNG OF THAT LADDER SO IN CASE I WAS TEMPTED TO GO UP BECAUSE I NEEDED AIR I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO. SO I WOULD PASS OUT IF NECESSARY BUT I WOULDN'T LOSE THE CONTEST BECAUSE I WOULDN'T SURFACE. I'D PASS OUT AND IF I DIDN'T DIE THEY'D FISH ME OUT IN TIME. BUT I'D WIN THE CONTEST. I WON AT BEING UNDER THE WATER LONGER THAN THE OTHER KIDS. AND I DIDN'T DIE. THEY DID HAVE TO FISH ME OUT A COUPLE OF TIMES. I GUESS I COULD HAVE HER COME RIGHT BACK IN AND WE COULD BE OKAY. SHE'D BE OFF DRIVING AND REALIZE THAT SHE MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE AND THESE TWO YEARS MADE HER REALIZE EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE BACK THE WAY IT HAD BEEN BEFORE AND SHE'D COME BURSTING IN THAT DOOR, DIFFERENTLY THAN THE LAST TIME SHE BURST IN THAT DOOR TWO YEARS AGO. MAYBE I SHOULD DO THAT. I COULD DO THAT, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE I'M MAKING THIS MOVIE. SO I COULD MAKE IT END THAT WAY IF I WANTED TO. I COULD MAKE HER COME BACK IN, SEE HER THERE, HAVE HER SAY TO ME "I'M SORRY". I'M SORRY. "I WAS WRONG". I WAS WRONG. "EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE". EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE FINE. "YOU WERE RIGHT, THIS IS WHERE I BELONG. THIS IS MY HOME". YOU WERE RIGHT. THIS IS WHERE I BELONG. THIS IS MY HOME. "I'M GOING TO BE HERE FOREVER AND NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN". I'M GOING TO BE HERE FOREVER AND NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN. I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN. HAPPY ENDING. HAPPY ENDING, BABY. ALL I KNOW IS THE ONLY POINT OF ANY OF THIS IS TO FIND SOME WAY TO MAKE YOURSELF HAPPY, YOU KNOW, AND TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE PERMISSION TO BE HAPPY IN LIFE. THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT. SO, UH, YOU HAVE PERMISSION TO BE HAPPY, OKAY? I'M GONNA TRY TO BE HAPPY, TOO.
