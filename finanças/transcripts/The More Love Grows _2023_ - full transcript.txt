It's my boss. He needs an update on the Denver presentation. We are taking Aly to college this morning. I don't care if space aliens invade Denver. It's family time. Good morning, family! Good morning! Hi! Mwah. Oh, I can't believe this might be the last breakfast I make you for four years. Oh, my goodness, Helen. She's only going to be a few hours away. Gram! Mom, once again, your key is for emergencies. Oh, darling. Let me make you some fresh eggs. These ones look a little rubbery. Mm. Hey, Paul. We fly out tomorrow. I just need to send this update now. There's always gonna be a business meeting. Let's just be here today. He's working hard for his family, darling. Now, Aly, my advice to you is to not hide away in the library. The next four years will be the best time in your life to meet young men who are good husband material. Aly is in the pre-med program, Mother. She's going to be focused on her education. Okay, yes. But, um, how do I know if someone is good husband material? Well, now, that is a wonderful question. When your grandfather was courting me, I had a whole list of qualities to look for in a man. Number one... Mm-hmm? Sense of humor. Hey. This is for you. Oh. Since you aren't bringing Mr. Teddy. Oh, Mom. It's perfect. Thank you. You have to make a children's book out of these. I draw Mr. Teddy for you, but I would love to if I could find the time and the right idea. Well, you'll have the time now that you're not going to be chauffeuring me around all the time. I could just come to college. I could drive you to class, cheer you on while you study... Okay. - The car's loaded up. - Great. I'm ready. Okay. Okay. Oh, you're going to need these tissues today. Thank you, Mom. You are going to wear something nice to take Aly to school, aren't you? ♪ Oh-oh I can taste the freedom ♪ ♪ I'm living right now ♪ ♪ Livin' right now ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, yeah ♪ ♪ I'm freewheelin' ♪ ♪ No worries, no doubts ♪ Okay. I left a first-aid kit in the other room, and there's fresh batteries in your smoke detector. Oh, and the closest emergency exit is just down the hallway, past your R.A.'s office. - I love you, too, Dad. - Okay. Come here. Bring it in. Come here. Mm. I'm so proud of you. You worked so hard, and I know you can achieve anything you set your mind to. Thanks, Mom. I'm going to miss you so much. I'm going to miss you, too. Okay. It's time to go, Helen. All right. You just call us any time, day or night, and we're going to scoop you up for a visit, okay? Okay. I love you. I love you, too. - Bye. - One more hug. Okay. - Oh, I'm so proud of you. - Helen! - Bye. - Bye. - Wait. Is that her roommate? - You must be Aly. I'm you're new roomie, Dana. Yeah, that's me. Are you going to the freshman orientation? Those were your parents that just left, right? Yeah. Why? Okay, I can finally take this off. We're not going to a lame orientation. We're going... to a frat party. I can't believe... how 18 years has just flown by. I can't believe we're just leaving her here. Remember how we used to just jump on my motorcycle and then we would just ride? - And then... - We had Aly. She was the best thing that ever happened to us. Oh. I couldn't agree more. But maybe it's time for us to start having our own adventures again. Maybe. You know, now that she doesn't need us anymore. I liked things how they were. Let's just... Let's stay here a little bit longer. She might call. Hmm. Well, you need anything, call us, okay? Proud of you, son. We're going to miss you so much, honey. Hey. All right. Well, I'll see you guys at Thanksgiving. Love you. Love you. Okay. Well, I will see you Thursday, buddy. You feeling Barzetti's or Regent Thai? Barzetti's for sure. Barzetti's it is. See you then. Bye, Amy. Bye, Ben. Hey! Not the pansies! Okay. You must have an owner. Dogs. He was cute, though. Honey, did you see the dog? I sure did. It was so cute. It sure was. Two dowels for each corner of the table. Hey. My flight leaves in a couple of hours. I hope your presentation goes well. I was hoping that we could finish our conversation before I leave. You know, the one about our future. It's been such a big day. Can we just talk about it when you get back? Yeah. Okay. I'm going to a barbecue at Kappa House. You coming? Oh, I can't. I've got to finish my first organic chemistry lab by Monday. Please? I don't want to go alone. Fine. Stay home instead of making friends. Whatever. I know, Mr. Teddy. I miss her, too. Let's text her. What do you think? Okay. I'll go. Okay. Who's that? Oh. It's my mom. Oh. Okay. - Ready to go. - Okay, let's go! I can't believe the girls are in college. Zoe hasn't called me once since she left. Aly either, and when she does respond to my text messages, it's with emojis I don't understand. Why don't you two join me next Saturday for singing bowl meditation yoga? It's great for relieving sadness vibrations. I'm in, if we can get mimosas afterwards. Paul's flight landed. He should be here by now. You guys start eating. I'll give him a call. Are you still mad because I let him stay up late last week? Okay. Yeah, sure. I'll see you in 20 minutes. Yeah. ♪ I get knocked down ♪ ♪ But I get up again ♪ ♪ You're never going to keep me down ♪ ♪ I get knocked down ♪ ♪ But I get up again... ♪ You're never gonna keep me down! Ah. "Tubthumping" is my power anthem, and I hold no shame in it. There's no shame in loving a classic. That one got me through a lot of angst when I was 17. It's funny how the songs we listened to in high school stick with us, right? Speaking of, are you a Carleton High dad? I'm Helen. I'm Aly Stevens' mom. Ben Tollman. I think we met at a parent-teacher conference. - Hey. - Hey, you. - Right. - Yeah. Yeah, my son, Skyler, went to high school with Aly. I knew I recognized you. You're in med school. Vet school, fourth year. And you are an artist, right? Technical illustrator. Furniture manuals, mostly. Oh, so you're the reason those instructions are so easy to follow. That's me. I should probably grab my order. I actually have to pick up my other little kiddo from his mom's, but it's good to see you. - Good to see you. - Come on. Let's go. Oh, Chip, what a move. What a legend. Hey. Where are you? Are you okay? You're home? So you're not coming? Everyone's waiting for you. Bye. I'll see you when I get home. So, how's it feel to be the last man standing now that Skyler's off to college? I mean, some extra attention is nice... but not too much. Oh, yeah, no. Here. Mm. - Hey, Dad? - Mm-hmm? Are you okay? Because I heard Mom tell Mark that you'd be happier if you met somebody. I'm happy, kiddo. Then why did Mom say that? Look, between you, vet school, and these two lazy little monsters, I've got lots to focus on. Don't you worry about me, okay? Okay. Here. At least pretend to eat a vegetable. You first. Ah... Our little secret. Hey! Are you leaving again? I thought you were here 'til next week. I got offered a promotion... VP at client development. Congratulations, honey! It's in our new Mountain West office. In Denver. In Denver? Well, what about our life here? I think I should go on my own. Long distance? I was kind of hoping you would start traveling less. Yeah. I wasn't thinking long distance. I've been telling myself that this feeling will pass, but this Denver job made me realize... Realize... what? That we've grown apart. Honey, if you really want to go to Denver, we are going to make something work. It's not just about Denver. Helen, I think we should separate. It's just... It's just not working... anymore. I don't want to hurt you. I just want to do what's best for us both. Okay. No, no, no. I think this is... This is not how you really feel. You're having a mid-life crisis. I'm going to sleep at the office, give us some space. I leave for Denver in a month. Our 20th anniversary is in two weeks. We are not splitting up. Goodbye, Helen. We are not splitting up. We are not splitting up... We are not splitting... up. Splitting up? What are you doing here? Well, I know how worked up you were about Aly leaving, so I roasted a chicken. I wanted you to have a balanced meal. What is going on with you and Paul? You look like something terrible has happened. We had an argument and he's sleeping in his office. What are you arguing about? He thinks we've grown apart and he's moving to Denver. Not without you, he's not. I'm taking a shower. You need a plan. How are you going to change his mind? I'm going to let him come to his senses and realize he should be begging me for forgiveness. Marriage isn't about keeping score, darling. If something is broken, you need to try and fix it. How many times have I told you what my mother used to say? "The more you tend it, the more love grows." A marriage withers without attention. Your father and I used to work on our marriage every single day. I am sorry that my marriage isn't perfect like yours and Dad's. It's not my choice to split up. I just wish you could support me for once. I know. Invite him over for dinner. Comfort food. Oh, and be ready to really listen. Oh, yes, and wear your blue dress. It really makes your eyes pop. You again. Who do you belong to? Okay, okay, okay. Are you hungry? Thirsty? I don't have any dogfood, but I could get you some water. Here you go. You look well fed. There must be someone missing you right now. Why don't you just go home and leave my flowers alone? Bye. Have a good day. Wow. You look nice. Thank you. Now sit down, and we are going to figure this out. I am ready to really listen. Thank you, but I really just came to give you this. An apology? These look official. I thought it would make things easier to finalize the separation. Give us a chance for a fresh start. A fresh start? Is that what you call breaking up our marriage? No. No. I'm sorry. I'm not explaining myself very well. I think you've explained plenty. Just don't say anything to Aly about this. She shouldn't have to deal with it when she's settling into college. No, you're right. We can tell her after we work out the separation. Helen... I hope that we can get through this as friends. Well, here's a friendly doggy bag. Now please leave. Hey. I didn't change your oil. Do you want me to come by this weekend? Just please get out of here. Oh! Oh! Come on. ♪ Now I am blue ♪ ♪ I am only one when we were two ♪ ♪ I have no one to hold ♪ ♪ The way that I held you ♪ ♪ Time passes on ♪ ♪ I find I've waited too long ♪ ♪ For this pain to be gone ♪ ♪ And for you to come home ♪ ♪ Now I am blue ♪ ♪ Blue ♪ Paul, what more could you possibly have to say? You again. Can I, um... Can I just look at your collar? Huh. You don't have one. Okay. Um, here's the deal. You can stay tonight, but no chewing, jumping, or scratching the furniture. Just no dog behavior. Got it? All right. No scratching. So do you eat chicken? You can have this if you want. It's boneless. Okay, good. You eat chicken. All right. I'm just going to make a quick phone call. There it is. Just be a minute. Hello? Hi. Uh, this is Helen Stevens. We ran into each other yesterday at Barzetti's. I just... I found your number in the Carleton High directory. Helen. Hey. Um... I was actually just about to head to bed. What's going on? Oh, gosh. What time is it? Oh, my goodness. It is late. No, that's okay. Is something wrong? No. Well, uh... there is just... There is a dog in my house, um, that won't leave, and I thought since you are a vet, you might be able to tell me what to do. How did the dog get in your house? Oh, I let him in, and then I just fed him because he looked hungry, and I had the worst night of my life, and I couldn't stand to see any more suffering in the world, but now he's here, so now what? It sounds like you're going through a lot. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to unload on you. No, no. It's okay. I had a patient today literally try and claw my eyes out. I mean, she's a cat. Look, why don't you bring the dog by the clinic tomorrow, see if they have an ID chip. I'll send you the address. Thank you. I come from a long line of absolute-not-dog-people, so I have no idea what to do with a four-legged runaway. Happy to help. I'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Dog? Where'd you go? I said no scratching! Then he came in with this tray of... Oh, um, no, I'm okay. Thank you so much, I'm full. Oh, I should go to sleep. I've got a class at 8:00 a.m. Can't you get notes from someone? We need to discuss Homecoming and getting invites to the right parties. I'm going to be studying. I've already got a midterm that week. Okay, I know your thing is being smart, but you're in college now. Why not try being cool? Maybe we could go to the game and I could study afterwards? Yes, you can! You are a terrible influence. She doesn't realize that one day she's going to wake up a 43-year-old woman whose husband leaves her for being too boring. Hey, am I boring? Step it out, work those legs. Oh! Good morning. Oh! Hi, honey! Hi, Mom. Have you seen my light-wash jeans? Uh, no, but I... I will look for them. Are you okay? You're all blotchy. Blotchy? Look. No way. You got a dog? Well, he's a stray, but I let him stay the night because it was so cold outside. Gee, Mom, what's next? Are we climbing Mount Everest over spring break? No, no, no. I'm going to keep both of my feet on the ground. He's so cute. What's his name? Well, he doesn't have a tag, but I guess I could call him Elmer because he wants to stick to me like glue. I gotta go to class. It's so awesome you got a dog. Love you! Hey. Sorry. Sorry. Rather than rehashing the reading, we'll be diving into an advanced... discussion... of resonance structures. I hope you're all caught up. Next slide, please. This will be on the exam. It will not make sense if you haven't done the reading, but I'm sure you all have. Ready? Page three. Hi, Mom. Ooh! Oh, you got Paul a dog! What a wonderful idea! Hello, Handsome. Hello. Yes. Yes. Wait. What is going on? Mom, you hate dogs. Well, actually, I suppose I can tell you now. It was your father who really didn't like dogs. I was just maintaining a united front. Well, the dog is a stray who won't leave, unlike Paul, who filed for a separation and wants to "wrap things up" before he goes to Denver. Did you... I did. I followed your retrograde advice. - Did... - It did not work. You should... I can't fix my marriage to Paul... You should... because I don't know why he broke it. May I speak now? Sure. I was going to suggest asking your friends if Paul has said anything. That is actually a really good idea. I know. All right, class. Once you have completed your stretches, I would like you all to move those beautiful bodies and meet me in a downward dog position. Helen! Are you okay? So Paul told James and Greg? Just that you're separating and he's moving to Denver. We should have called you. We just didn't know what to say. Do you need anything? Intel. Where is this coming from? I need James and Greg to find out everything they can, then they can tell Paul the truth... That he has gone crazy and he's making a huge mistake. We were thinking more like moral support. We shouldn't get in the middle. We've been friends since the girls' first day of kindergarten. It's just... we love you both. Then help me save my marriage! This is not social time with friends. I don't have any friends here. All right, everyone. Let's cleanse away that negative energy. Breathe in, breathe out... Breathe in, breathe out. We are going to find your owner. There you go. Okay, buddy. Back seat. Well, he doesn't have an ID chip to help us find his owner, but he has definitely been well taken care of, haven't you, pal? So what do we do now? I mean, I would take him, but I already have two dogs at home, and I don't really have the space for a third. Oh. Oh, no, no. I am not in a good place to have a dog because I've never had one, and... Sorry. I'm going through a separation right now. It's brand-new. I get it. I can tell you, it gets easier. I'll tell you what. Leave Elmer with me. I will call around to a few shelters, thank you very much, and we'll see what we can do. Thank you. I truly appreciate it. Hey, buddy. Good luck out there. Yeah. Okay. I will take him, temporarily, while we look for your owner. Really? That is... That's incredible of you. I cannot leave you to take your chances at a shelter. Can I, buddy? No, I cannot. But here's the thing. I don't know the first thing about having a dog. I don't know what kind of dogfood we need? Do we need a doghouse? Do we need dog toys? Do you want me to go to the pet store with you? Yes! I do! I will take all the help I can get. Yeah. I, um... I have a couple of hours now. Do you want to go? All right. Let's get you set up, buddy. We're going to go get you some squeaky toys. Okay. Let's go. Okay. For you, Elmer. Let's see. You're going to want a leash. What about... red? Elmer, do you like red? Is this your color? Oh. Red suits him, hmm? He's a jaunty fellow. And chew on these. Okay? And not our furniture. You know what? I'm, uh... I'm going to send you the address of my favorite dog park. The more exercise he gets, the less inclined he'll be to destroy your house. Then we will spend a lot of time there with these. You want to play fetch? You are going to want this as well. Oh, yes, and you, too. Fetch elbow is a real thing. Um... and, oh. What about this for Elmer? Ooh. I love it. And maybe some coveralls for when he excavates my flower beds. Thank you. And thank you so much again for your help and advice. Oh, you deserve the thanks, taking on a senior dog. Most people wouldn't. I believe in sticking by people, and now dogs, I guess. Yeah, me too. You two are going to do great. The whole neighborhood is going to want to take you home with a face like this, Elmer. A few posts online, some posters around town. We will find your home in no time. Hey. How's it going? "Describe his disposition"? He is a hamster. Ah, he looks pretty calm to me. You know, I'm going to be really glad when this rotation is over. Oh, well, hello. Who's Helen? Oh, she's just a mom from Skyler's school. I helped her with a stray dog today. Right. No. No, no, no, no. Nothing like that. We're just... friends. That's it. Just friends. All right. So when's the last time you went on a date anyways? Yeesh. That long, huh? Look, my priorities are being a dad and starting a vet practice. That's it. Whatever you say, buddy. I'd rather spend my time with a pretty lady than Mr. Fluffernutter over here. Hey! Off the furniture! Okay. Maybe just for a little bit. Do you like television? You want to watch a show? Go get it! Good boy. Let's find your home. Elmer, that's to drink. Oh, wow. Oh! Oh, Elmer! No! Let's go play. Come on. Good boy. Here we are. We're at a park. Dogs are pack animals. You need to be the leader. Elmer! Sit! Sit! Sit!! Uh, yelling doesn't work either. You've got to lead by showing confidence, okay? Watch this. Like this. Watch. Okay. Joey Ramone. Hi, Joey Ramone. There you go. Good boy, good boy. Sit. Good. Down. Roll. Good boy. Wow. Dance! Let's dance and dance and dance! - Look at his hands. - Yeah, you got it! - That's so cute. - Good boy. Now you try it, okay? Um, okay. Elmer, sit. Sit. Oh! - See? You got it. - Good job. - Wow. - Yeah, it's easy. I know we just met, but could I take you to coffee and pick your brain for dog advice? I'm Helen. I'm a dog newbie. Oh, dog newbie, are you? Okay. Well, I'm Cindy, by the way. Um, yeah, I'd love to give you some dog tips. - I know a great place. - All right. Let's do this. Elmer, we're going to go get some coffee. Do you drink coffee? I don't think, uh... I don't think that's going to be... No, I don't think a dog can have a coffee. Praise the behavior you want more of. So if you call Elmer and he comes right back, lay it on thick. So it's just like with kids. Never had any, but dog nature and human nature is not that different. Can I use the same technique to get a husband who walked out to come back when I call him? Well, if he walked out on you, you're better off without him. I don't want to get divorced. You know what? I thought my life was over when my husband ran off with our landlady, but it turns out divorce was the best thing that ever happened to me. Because he was a cheater? Mm, no. Because I found music again. I needed an outlet, and a friend of mine has a son who's in a punk band, and so he invited me to come on down and scream into the microphone. And then writing songs became my passion, and I have been singing with Cindy and the Rogues ever since. That is so... different. Mm, yeah. I know. My ex burned my life down, and, um... I rose from the ashes rocking. So... how are you going to take your power back? I could get new throw pillows. Ah... Paul always hated them, so I never had them on our couch. That's a start. Yeah, it's a good one. Yeah. Pillows. But, you know, I'm just going to write down a number of a really cool lady. We've become really good friends, actually, and, well, she helped me through a really, really awful time. You need to call a lawyer. I'm not ready for that. Ready or not, you can either stand up for yourself, or get run over, so... Wow. You are so talented. Thank you. It's gorgeous. Thank you.

See you Wednesday, Mother. We can do it! Very cute. I can see that. We should go talk to them. Oh, my gosh. Oil changes for beginners. Loosen the drain plug. That looks like a drain plug.

Well, you underestimated me in a lot of ways, Paul. Now please leave. Thank you, Elmer. Hi. My name is Helen Stevens, and I need to talk to a lawyer. I am taking back my power. Hey, buddy. You want to get up here with me? Good night, Elmer. - Hey! - Hey! This park is so beautiful. Yeah. Just another reason to have a dog. Aw. They're all being so nice! Like, no barking or anything. Go on. There you go. So what did you do before you went back to vet school? I was a sales manager at a software company for about 18 years. What led you to make a change after that much time? My divorce, to be honest. I just got so tired of moping around, I decided to make myself happy and follow a lifelong dream to work with animals. - I like it. - Mm-hmm. What about you? Did you always want to be a technical illustrator? It was a great job to have while Aly was growing up. It's a flexible schedule. I could work from home. I could really fit work around being a mom. Okay, but... Does it make you want to jump out of bed in the morning? Not exactly. I studied fine art in college, and then Paul and I got married, and we had Aly, and a mortgage. Life happened. - Exactly. - Yeah. You know, Aly keeps telling me I should get back into drawing, and maybe I will. I'll just dust off my coloured pencils, you know. What do I have to lose? I like that. Draw those lemons into lemonade! Maybe I will. It sounds nice to have something positive to focus on right now. It's my lawyer. Hello. This is Helen. Hey, come on! Come hang. Oh, actually, I gotta take this. It's kinda loud in there. So loud. Hey, have I seen you around the science building? You look familiar. I'm Aly. I'm freshman. Pre-med major. Trevor. I'm a freshman, too. Sorry. I'm studying bio. So if you're pre-med, you must be taking organic chemistry with Professor Shaul. Yeah. It's brutal. I'm actually supposed to be studying now, but my roommate begged me to come out with her tonight. Yeah. My brother's a junior and he said if I didn't get out of the library and go to a party, he would sign me up for online dating. - Wow. - Yeah. Dana! Dana! Dana! I should probably go check on my roommate. Um, I'm supposed to be her party buddy. Yeah. Dana! Like, now. I'll see you around the science building. Yeah. Bye. Bye. The court set a mediation date. I have to decide what's mine and what's his. We've lived in that house for 20 years. Everything is ours. Get as much as you can while he's planning his midlife crisis. In the meantime, you want something to take your mind off things? If you're free. Ahem. I'm playing a show. I even wrote a new song about Elmer. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Do I have to get a mohawk? A faux-hawk at least. That will be perfect for my anniversary dinner. - What? - With my mother. Maybe if I distract her with my hair, she'll forget to lecture me about my marriage. Ah. You know what? You can just tell her you're no longer part of the patriarchal machine. I wish you were coming to dinner. You should come to dinner! I'm afraid my anniversary's going to turn me into a mess. No, we can't have that. I'll come. I'll come. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Helen! Hey! Hi. Oh, you. Come on. Hey, Cindy. Hi there. How is Joey Ramone's paw? Ah, much better. Good. Good. It was great running into you the other day. I had a really nice time. Yeah. Maybe we can take the pups for a walk sometime. I would like that, yes. Great. I'll give you a call. Or Chip and Chunk will text Elmer, - something like that. - That sounds good. - See you soon. - See you soon. - See ya. - Ciao. Bye. Come on, boys. So... So what? Someone has a dog-walking date. It's not a date. I'm still married. Ah. Separated. - Darling. - Mom! Oh! You look lovely when you dress up. Ah. Let's sit down. Okay. This place looks really nice. Mm-hmm. Hey! - Cindy! - Cindy? Sue! I love that we're reclaiming Helen's anniversary as her Independence Day! Yes! Mom, I wanted you to meet my new friend since she's been so supportive. Yeah. Isn't that nice? Excuse me. We're going to need another place setting here. And a wine list. Thank you. You must be so proud of Helen. She is not letting this divorce get her down. In fact, she's making friends with Elmer's hunky new vet. She is not getting divorced. Helen, you shouldn't be making any new friends. You should be saving your marriage to... Helen? Paul! What are you doing here? Well, your mother wanted to talk to me. You two need to sort things out. I'm leaving. And I'm sorry for dragging you into this. Don't worry about me. I'm also... I am taking my cake. Atta girl. Helen! I didn't know you were going to be here, I promise. I believe you. This has my mother's fingerprints all over it. I should not have let things spiral out of control without talking to you. Why didn't you talk to me? I kept trying, but it seemed like you didn't want to listen. I should have tried harder to stay connected. I really do want to stay friends. I care about you so much, even if I haven't always acted like it. You are an incredible dad to Aly, and we'll always be her parents together, but as for more than that... I don't know. Happy anniversary. I cannot process this evening without ice cream. Elmer, do you like ice cream? I feel like if I were a dog, I would really like ice cream. That's just a guess. Guess we'll find out, won't we? Did you eat my whole cake? It's okay. I've got ice cream. What's going on? You all right? What's going on? Hey. I think something's wrong with Elmer. What's going on? I went to get ice cream, and he ate my chocolate lava cake, and now he's just laying on the couch whimpering. Chocolate's toxic for dogs. - I poisoned him? - No, no, no. You didn't know, but meet me at the clinic, okay? Okay. We'll be right there. And Whiskers is all good to go. Just keep the cone on for the next five days, yeah? See you, little guy. Excuse me, Doctor? Um, do you know how my dog is doing? I don't know what I'm going to do if he's not okay. Oh, I can definitely go check for you. What's his name? Elmer. I'm Helen. His vet is Ben Tollman. Oh. He's mentioned you. I'll go check where he's at, yeah? Thank you. Thank you so much. No problem. Well, it was a very rough night, but he's going to be okay. Oh! Hey there! How are you feeling? Oh, you scared me, buddy. Oh, I'm so glad you're okay. You're our hero. You saved him. Oh, I am not his favorite person right now. I made him eat activated charcoal and he threw up a lot. Poor baby. You know, I'm second shift tomorrow. If you wanted, I could swing by and check on him on my way in. I would love that. Would you love that, Elmer? Yes, yes. He says, "We would love that." We will, um... We'll see you tomorrow. - Yeah. - Thank you so much again. Oh, of course. All right. Let's get you home. We are never, ever going to touch chocolate again. Ever ever, okay? Thank you again for coming by to check on him. Yeah, no problem at all. You're on my way to the clinic. Besides, I should have said something about chocolate. So how's he doing? Let's just say... he gets knocked down, but he'll get up again. You are never gonna keep him down. Exactly. No, he'll be good as new with a few days' rest. I'm sorry for imposing, but you were the first person I thought of to call. Glad you did. Oh, by the way, I have a pamphlet for you, "Dogs and People Food," just for future reference. Ooh. Thank you. And I have... oh. Bye, Elmer. A get well soon gift. How did you know he likes chewing on socks? A universal dog trait. I actually have something for you. Yeah. You had mentioned that you wanted to get back into drawing, so. This is incredibly thoughtful. - Thank you. - Yeah, of course. Hey. You have the exact same edition of Oliver Twist that I had in high school. It's my favorite book. My dad actually got that for me in 10th grade. It's my favorite, too. Uh-oh. Okay. Who's your favorite character? Fagin. You've got to be kidding me. What? Who is yours? Artful Dodger? Obviously, because he's the coolest. I mean, who goes out and does all the actual work while Fagin sits at home counting their pennies? Do you have to go to work right now? Uh, not for about an hour. Well, then sit down, my friend. We are going to settle this. All right. Let's see what you've got. Wait 'til you see all the notes I have written in here, from high school. It's going to be embarrassing, isn't it? Mm-hmm. Oh. Oh, wow. This was fun. Yeah. I wish I didn't have to go to work. I'd say we should order some pizza and watch the musical. How about we go on that walk you suggested when Elmer's feeling better? I'd love that. - See you soon. - See you soon. Oh, you want to go on a walk already! All right. Let's go. So pink is for me, blue is for Paul. All right. Normative, but I'll go with it. I don't even know where to start. I mean, everything here has a memory attached to it. Yeah, but stuff is just stuff. You know, you're going to have your memories whether or not you keep the... owl lamp. My aunt gave that to us. It doesn't even work half the time. Okay, that's what I'm talking about. You gotta ditch the baggage. Let me ask you this. What makes you feel excited about your new life? I liked being able to change my own oil. That made me feel strong and capable, and I would like to do more things for myself. Like, I wish I could fix that ridiculous lamp. I have an idea. Bring the lamp. So this is more than just a coffee shop. Oh, yeah. It's a repair cafe Wednesdays, board games Thursdays. Fridays? Uh, babies. That's so cool! You think they can fix my lamp? Oh, yeah. They can fix anything. Marriages? I thought you said you liked how you felt by doing things by yourself. Oh! Wanna learn how to use power tools? Why stop there? Let's build something. I love it. Thatta girl. Hey! Can you give us a hand? I would love to fix Mr. Owl here. Hey. Hey, Aly! Al-y! Hey. I'm sorry to wake you, but the library's closing, and, uh... and that janitor can kind of be mean about people trying to stay late. Oh. I'm not even halfway through the material for my organic chemistry midterm tomorrow. Well, if you need a place to study, the student center is open 24/7. Well then, that is where I'm going. Um, can I... Can I walk you there? That would be really nice. - Come on. - Okay. Let's do this. Hungry. Okay, let's go. After you. All right. Nothing in here is particularly hard or new. We've discussed all of this, so it should be easy for you, provided you've been paying attention, which I'm sure you all... have been. All right. You have one hour... beginning now. Okay. I was an only child, too! Did your parents love animals? More like animal-likers. I mean, they loved our cat, Maina, because she pretty much took care of herself, but they would never go for a dog. And you? Did you grow up in a household of artists? My dad was an engineer. My mom, a homemaker. Our house was very structured, so I've tried to be more laid-back with Aly. Are we talking navel piercings or Taylor Swift concerts? More like if Aly had a bad day at school, we'd eat cheese and crackers and watch movies, but lately, she's not even taking my calls. Yeah. Skyler's been the same. You know, it's funny. We turn ourselves inside out trying to give them everything they need. At some point, they're the only ones that know what that is. All we can really do is try our best, right? Great. Now I have to call my mom. Oh! We should, uh... - Come on, Elmer! Let's go. - Do you want my jacket? No, no. I'm good. Thanks, though. Let's go. - Come on, boys. - Whoo! Perfect fit. I just... I can't get over your sketches. They're amazing. Well, someone gave me a lovely set of coloured pencils, and I have something for you. You have helped us in so many ways, so I wanted to say thank you... with this. It's just a sketch, I know. It's not the Mona Lisa. Wow. Okay, well, now I'm just thinking about you sketching outside the Louvre. Oh, I've always wanted to go to Paris. Really? Hmm. Come with moi to the City of Lights. ♪ ...de savoir que je suis ♪ ♪ Dans l'amour ♪ ♪ Tellement en amour avec vous ♪ ♪ C'est la vie... ♪ I should probably get some more work done. ♪ ...Je suis en amour avec vous ♪ Yeah. I should probably do some stuff before I pick up Charlie from school. Thank you so much for the picture. Of course. It's incredible, and the shirt, amazing, and all of it. It's all yours. Okay. Come on, boys. Mom, are you okay? I'm... You're what? Are you dying? I'm an awful mother. Oh, Mom. Come in. Elmer, it's okay, buddy. It's okay. Maybe, um... we could try to talk about this calmly. He doesn't like conflict. It's okay. - I'm sorry. - Mom, it's okay. It's okay, buddy. Oh, I made him go away. It's all right. He's okay. I'm so sorry. When you told me you think I don't support you, I... You mean everything to me, my darling. Thank you for saying that, but do you understand why I feel that way when I'm just doing the best I can? Oh, yes, I do understand. I should have told you this a long time ago. Your father and I separated once. What? You remember that summer you and I spent with your grandparents? Well, your dad and I had been fighting, so we agreed to spend some time apart to cool down. Why did you not tell me? Oh... I don't know. I just thought it was better for you if we dealt with our problems privately, but... a good mother... A good mother would have set an example on how to handle marital struggles. Mom, you have always been the best mother you can possibly be. Oh. And you, you're strong and brave and loving, and you're a wonderful mother to Aly. I just... I want you to know I am always on your team. Thank you. Does this mean I have to like your aggressive new friend? No, it doesn't, but maybe you could come to her concert, give her a chance. I suppose I can do that. Oh. Hello? Yes, I put up the posters about the dog. He's yours? Sure. We... We can meet you tomorrow. We'll see you soon. Hey, buddy. We may have just found your home. Hello? Hey. It's Ben. Hey! I'm just giving Elmer a bath. How are you? Whoa! I was just wondering if you wanted to go to an art show with me tomorrow. Your drawing's making me want to look at art. Yeah. That sounds fun. Let's do it. You want to shake, shake... Oh! I have to go. Sorry. Soapy dog here. I'll see you tomorrow. All right. Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. That was just a friendly invite, right? Not like a date. You almost ready to get out? We're getting out. - Hey! - Hey! Hi! - Good to see you. - Yeah, you too. Hey. Uh, should we check it out? That sounds great. There was something I wanted to talk about, actually. Helen? Hey? Hey? Oh, sorry. Um... it's just I may have found Elmer's family. I'm meeting with them later this afternoon, which I know is great. I mean, that's... It's good. It's what I... But you're going to miss him. Yes! Is that crazy? I didn't want a dog. Now I don't want him to leave. No, no. It's not crazy to me. It's one of the things I like most about you. Well, thank you. What is it you wanted to talk to me about? Oh. Uh, it can wait. It's fine. Why don't we check out this masterpiece, "Youthful Innocence"? It's very youthful. - And innocent, I think. - Yes. Duke! Where have you been? You had us worried sick! So he really is your dog. He was my uncle's, but he passed away last month, so we took Duke in. Oh, I'm so sorry. Thank you so much for finding him. I'm Marisa. And I'm Justin, and, uh, these are our loud, rambunctious, very active kids. I think the constant chaos of our household stressed him out. I've noticed he doesn't like conflict. Would you like to come inside? We've got some coffee and fresh-baked cookies laid out. Oh, no, no. I don't... I don't want to get in the way. Come on, buddy. You want to go inside? He seems to be quite taken by you. Would it help you all out if he came to live with me? I would love to give him a home. I think he'd love that. Hey there, buddy. You want to come home with me? You do? Um, excuse me, Professor? I got a D-plus on my midterm and I need a B-plus average to maintain my pre-med scholarship. I was wondering if maybe I could do some extra credit? This isn't high school. There is no extra credit. Oh, um... Well then, what can I do? You can work very hard and perform exceptionally well on the two remaining midterms and the final exam. Or you can choose an easier course of study. Is there anything else? Um, no. Thank you. Elmer! Dinner! We're family now, buddy. I never thought I would say this, but I am so glad you're staying with me. Key's under the mat! Come in unless you're an intruder! - Hi. - Hi. Maybe find out if it's an intruder before you mention the spare key. I got this little doggy bed for Elmer now that he's staying here for good. That is very nice of you, but I've actually decided to let him sleep in my bed, which is where he is right now. It's official. You're a dog person. Hey, what's this? Well, I realized last night that all of my drawings of Elmer could be a story. I think I have whole a book, maybe even a whole series. Yeah. Elmer could have all sorts of different adventures. Which means I need to have more adventures of my own for inspiration. Are you busy later today? No. No, I'm not. Ooh. You okay? Yeah. I might be a teeny tiny bit terrified of heights. So you decided to climb a 40-foot wall? Aly loves climbing, but I've always been too scared to try it, so today's the day. Hey. No pressure, okay? I may not make it to the top, but I'm going to be very brave and I'm going to try. Okay. I love that I invited you to do something crazy with me and you didn't even hesitate to say yes. Normally, I have to do these kind of adventures alone, so it's nice to have a partner. I know, right? I'm really glad we're friends. Right. What's on your mind? Well, um... You know, when I'm with you, as much as I do... I love... I love being your friend... I'd like to be more. With me? Yeah. If you feel the same way. Oh. I... I just... I don't... I don't really know how I feel. I mean, yes, I am starting to have feelings for you, too, but I just... I guess I don't know if that's really what's good for me right now. Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Yeah, no, I completely understand. Yeah. Well, I should get home. I've got to get ready for my mediation tomorrow. Here. Let me, um... - Oh, sorry. - Sorry. - The chair. - Right. - Yeah. - Well, I'll see you soon. Yeah. Hey. What are you guys doing here? We are so sorry. We handled things totally wrong. We should have been there for you as soon as we heard. How are you doing? Well, after mediation tomorrow, I'm going to be 43 and alone for the first time in decades. For what it's worth, James and Greg told Paul he's being a colossal idiot. I'm actually okay with it. I'm learning I can stand on my own two feet. And we are so proud of you for that. Can we still be your besties? We brought cake. Come on in. I love you guys. Also, I love cake, so. All right. Let's begin with the division of assets, starting with the house. Mr. Stevens, what is your position? My position is that we should both live in the house... together. I think I made a mistake. Paul! I changed my mind about Denver. I think we should try to make this work. Will you stay married to me? I need to talk to you outside. Okay. What is going on? So you're not... You're not going to Denver? I want to stay. I want to give us a chance to work on things. But why? You. You started acting in ways that I... I could never even imagine, and then I realized that maybe you had to be the steady one because I was so restless, and maybe things would have been different if I could have been the anchor. Go on. I mean, what if I made a mistake? What if we could have new adventures together? We could go backpacking again. A backpacking trip around the world isn't going to fix us... and that's okay. You want to go to Denver. You're excited for a new opportunity, and I've started building my own life. I'm proud of what I'm doing and who I'm becoming. I know. I see it. I can't go backwards. So what do we do now? We tell Aly. Together. Hey? Anyone home? Mom? Dad? It's a lot for her to process, so... It's delicate. We just need to come up with the best way to tell her. Tell me what? What is going on around here? Aly, what are you doing here? - Aly, are you okay? - I don't understand. You're splitting your stuff? Are you getting a divorce? Is that why you've both been acting so weird? Your mother and I have been having problems, and we're taking some time apart. Time apart? Honey, we're separated. Why didn't you tell me? You have so much going on right now. Well, not anymore. I'm flunking organic chemistry, and I'm going to lose my scholarship. I'm switching to an easier major. What? Why do you care? You're separated and you didn't even think that you should tell me? Okay, Elmer, not right now. I'm going to Gram's. I'll take the bus back to campus tomorrow. Elmer! No! Elmer ran away. Hey, can you bring Chip and Chunk to the dog park? Maybe if he sees his friends, he'll come back. Thank you. Maybe he'll come back on his own. Or maybe he'll get lost again and end up in a shelter with no one to take care of him. Okay, I'm here. Which way did he go? We don't know. He got out too quickly. Well, I'll take Gram. I'm going to the dog park. I'll go... this way. Elmer! Elmer! Elmer! Elmer! Well, this clearly isn't working. I'm going to go home and make him a steak. Elmer likes steak. So you're going to walk around holding a steak so he comes to you? Yeah. I am. I can't think of anything else to do. All right. I'll come with you. I should go by myself. Hey, are we okay? We haven't talked since the other day when I mentioned... what I mentioned... but I want to be here for you. I know... and... I guess I'm just not ready yet. Yeah. If Elmer ever does come back... maybe I should find him a new home. No, come on, Helen. He needs a home he'll be happy in, not one he wants to run away from. Elmer? Elmer! You came home! Oh, my goodness. I was so worried. Let's get you inside. I am sorry the arguing upset you. I know you hate it, but it really hurt that you ran away. Oh, Elmer! You found him! - Oh, my gosh. - Yes. Hi, buddy. I'll text Dad and let him know you found him. I'm really sorry I let him out. It's not your fault, honey. My word, you scared us! Yes, you did! Yes, you did! Gram, you like dogs now? Can you go upstairs and get Elmer some of his special treats? Let's get him settled in for the night. Come here, you. - Off to bed. Off to bed. - Come here, little buddy. Aw, you scared us. Yeah! You have had quite the night, honey. And quite the day. In mediation, Paul said he wanted to try again. I told him no. That was after Ben told me he wants to be more than friends. Is that what you want? I like him... maybe even really like him, but it's too much right now. I've got to get off this emotional rollercoaster. It's been quite the ride. Mom, would you be open to taking Elmer? I don't think I can handle him running away again. Oh, darling, I know how much you've been through, but Elmer isn't Paul, and neither is Ben. You need to talk to Aly, so I'm going to get out of here. I love you, darling. I love you, too, Mom. Bye-bye, Aly. Bye, Gram. Love you. I love you, too. Is that sharp cheddar? Oh, I brought everything. Honey, I'm really sorry that I didn't tell you. Honestly, I think I was just trying process it myself. Have you... processed it? Gram says, "The more you tend it, the more love grows..." and I guess I've been learning that love changes, and it grows with time. And it's funny. I'm actually more comfortable with myself right now than I've ever been. I really hate you and Dad not being together... but I want you both to be happy. Thank you. Oh, I love you so much. I love you, too, Mom. So what happened with college? Oh. I didn't study enough. I was too busy trying to be cool and make friends. Is that why you haven't wanted to talk to me? I just want you to be proud of me. I am proud of you because of who you are. I know, but I just feel like I've messed it all up too much. Maybe you can fix it. But where would I even start? I think you have to figure that out. It's what... What do you kids call it these days? "Adulting"? Gosh.
