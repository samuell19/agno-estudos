Here. -Have some of this. -It'll do you good. Come on, let's go. -She was so young. -It's no wonder, with a life like that. -She stayed indoors all day. -She was so beautiful. -Yes. She's the angel Gabriel. -It's awful. That's life. -What do you think, doctor? -I don't know. I'll be honest. I don't know. It's not so much a matter of how the body reacts. Are you staying here? Alright. Someone should be with him at all times. We're here, sir. Number 32. Are you one of those disciples, or whatever they're called? One of the enlightened? See what all that hysterical nonsense can lead to? Some people need some sense drummed into them. -Some people can't live, doctor. -Some people don't want to live. That's what reading books all day long will get you, doctor. You don't meet other people. Oh, brother. My little brother. Look, Fransoo. He's only half the man he used to be. He's not the same person anymore. What do you have to say to your Charlotte? What do you have to say to me? Come on. Come with me, lad. Come with Charlotte. -Saint Gabriel. Saint Raphael. -Pray for us. -All the saints, angels, and archangels. -Pray for us. Saint Joseph. Saint Barabas. Saint Mark. Holy Trinity, one God. Have mercy on us. -Saint Mary. Holy mother of God. -Pray for us. Blessed virgin of virgins. Saint Michael. Saint Gabriel. Saint Raphael. All the saints, angels, and archangels. Saint John the Baptist. Saint Joseph. All the saints, patriarchs, and prophets. Saint Peter. Saint Paul. Saint Andrew. Saint John. Saint Thomas. Saint Jacob. Saint Philip. Saint Bartholomew. Saint Matthew. Saint Simon. -Saint Thaddeus. -Pray for us. He'll recover, Charlotte. He's not ready to meet Our Lord yet. -So why did you administer the last rites? -Because you never know. And it's better to be prepared for the worst. See, you said it yourself, Father. The worst. Charlotte. Listen to me. He'll recover. Saint Barnabas. Saint Luke. Saint Mark. Saint Ambrose. Saint Augustine. Saint Hieronymus. Saint Martin. Saint Nicholas. All the saints, bishops, and confessors. All the blessed Doctors of the Church. Saint Anthony. Saint Bernard. Saint Benedict.

Your fever has almost gone. That's good. That's very good. You're a big boy. Now drink up your milk. Come on. It's goat milk with cinnamon and sugar. Come on, drink some. There. That's better. That's my little brother. I've had enough. -You've left your meat again. -I don't like meat. You must eat it. You need to get your strength back. Thanks, Charlotte, but I just can't eat that meat. What are you talking about? I do my best to feed you well, I select the best pieces of pork for you and you don't even look at them. You and your city ways. You've seen where they get you. What's wrong with pork? Our Lord created pigs to serve us, for us to eat them, boiled and fried. Sure, laugh, you heathen. Come here. I swear by Saint Anthony and his pig… that starting tomorrow, I will eat that holy meat. Alright. Tomorrow I'll make pork chops with stewed pears. I'm satisfied. You've put on almost three kilos already. Now take off those glasses so you can see the world. Hey, mister. Over there. Go sit on that barrel. And stay still. Or it will hurt. -That's enough. -No, just a bit more here. There. All done. Now you look good. -The moustache has to go, too. -What? Your moustache? No, a man without a moustache is like a summer without the sun. It still has to go. Fetch us some Easter wine. We have to celebrate this. My old hair is gone. I'm a new man. Hair cut short and clean shaven. -Almost like a Roman. -A half-litre jug? Are you mad? To celebrate a man reborn? -We'll start with a litre. -You're a right palloeter. -Palloeter? What kind of word is that? -Don't you know it? Have you never heard it before? You, who goes to the city so much? A palloeter is someone who just wastes his time, like you do. Here's your litre. Pallieter. Pallieter? Pallieter. Pallieter. Charlotte, I swear by Saint Roch and his boils that from now on, that'll be my new name. Pallieter. A new head, a new man, a Pallieter. A new head, a new man, a Pallieter. A new head, a new man, a Pallieter. Hallelujah. Oh, Lord Jesus. Have you gone mad? What's the matter? Don't you want to see a man as God made him? Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. -And lead us not into temptation… -Oh Lord… Let me continue the prayer. Oh Lord, my stomach wishes to do justice to Your bread. Oh Lord, my mouth overflows when I smell Your strawberries. Oh Lord, You have placed a barrel organ in my stomach. Amen. Here, start. It's a good thing the pastor didn't hear your strange prayers. Well, Pallieter, how's life? Like the sun, Father. A man can't get enough of it. The sun is the cream of life, but it does scrape my throat dry. We have a good remedy for that. Here you are, a double brown. -Have you come for your breads, Father? - If you don't mind, Charlotte. I'll go and get them. There's always a reason to enjoy yourself, no? Ah, Pallieter… You took the words right out of my mouth. They're still a bit fresh, but they'll be just right tomorrow. -Thank you. -Oh dear, I've made your cassock dirty. Better to have flour on a black cassock than fly poo on your soul. -Thank you again, Charlotte. -You're more than welcome, Father. You know just how to twist women around your little finger. I wish I did. It's easy, my friend. Become a pastor. Hello, Fransoo. Here you are. How wonderful to be able to do that. I can't do anything. Except sing. And even then… Yes, I can eat and drink as well. Fantastic. That's Fransoo. He rents this mill from me. He regularly gives me a masterpiece in return. Hello, dear Fransoo. He's not very talkative, but that's not his fault. Is it, Fransoo? I was just explaining where we are going to straighten the Nete. I'm sure that will interest you. Look, from that bend on the left there we'll create be a shorter route to the woods and fields over there. What did you say? Who's going to straighten the Nete? I am, my dear man. Me and my company. But why? For the boats. It's unthinkable that we should continue to contend with those useless bends in the river. -You can't be serious. -I am. The project has already begun. Ruin this countryside? I don't think so, sir. Even if you are the count. Isn't he funny? My dear man, I don't know you. But this is none of your business. None of my business? I live here. This is my countryside. Next we'll have to ask the man for permission to go riding. Fransoo, is he a friend of yours? Then I must ask you to choose your friends more carefully in future. Whether you agree with it or not, this entire countryside is my property, officially and legally. The area belongs to those who live here, and to God. No alterations will be made. Then God should see my notary. Come, my friends, let's go. You can't change the course of the river just because your family has money. My ancestors fought for this land, and paid for it with their own blood. Is that so? Then you and I can fight over it, too. Well, Gerard? Are you mocking my ancestors? I certainly am. And you as well. -What weapon do you choose? -A cannon. A cannon? What cannon? -Dear God. -Such awful manners. Goodbye, and Godspeed. Gerard. No, I'm too scared. Here, Greet. Yes, Greet. Shut your eyes. -Look. Bubbles. -Where? Here, look. Here. Bubbles. That's a big one. Pallieter. Pallieter, look. My tooth. It's my own tooth. Look. It's as if… I'm blowing my soul out of my body. -It's a shame we can't keep them. -Our teeth? No, silly, the bubbles. You're right, Frieda. We should always be able to see ourselves. In the sky, in the trees. We should hang mirrors in the trees so that we see everything double. Pallieter, you promised. -What, Tuur? -That you would tell us a story. -Me? -Yes, Pallieter. You promised. -A story? Why? -Spoilsport. It's beautiful enough here without stories. I'd rather hear a story about things that aren't real. -About things I can't see. -What? But you can see everything in the world if you truly want to and do your best to see it. -Look, I can see a ship right this moment. -That's not true. A magnificent ship. A ship that is painted with flowers, garlands, and flags. -Where? -Over there. -Can't you see it? -No. Yes, I can see it. Now I can see it clearly. What a beautiful ship. With flags and pennants. -Yes, there it is. -Where? -There, in the middle of the field. -A ship with sails. -And a Belgian flag. -And soldiers. -And sailors with guns. -They are men with beards. All who want to sail to Iceland Must be men with beards Jan, Piet, Joris and Korneel They have beards, they have beards Jan, Piet, Joris and Korneel They have beards, they can go How pleased Our Lord will be with such beautiful-- Oh, children. Come on, let's say a short prayer. Hands together, eyes closed. Oh Jesus, Our Lord up in heaven I pray to you on bended knees for nice weather. Dear Jesus, if it rains tomorrow, it will be to Charlotte's sorrow. Quiet, you profaner. Do you want it to be wet? Our nice confetti. You just want to make the Beguines jealous because their confetti isn't as nice. -Yes, they'll be green with envy. -Charlotte, come with me. -Whereto? -Outside. Outside. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. Pallieter, have you lost your mind? Mr. Jesus of Nazareth, your friend, said: "Be like children." Aunt Jeanne's mirror, God rest her soul. Pallieter, tell me you didn't. Tell me it isn't true. It looks like the circus. -Our house is like a circus. -It is, Charlotte. -Life is one big circus. -What will the family say about this? -Here we are again. -Look at that. -You can't even see the house anymore. -There they are. Pallieter and Aunt Charlotte. Well I never. -Hello, Pallieter. -Hello, Magda. -We've never seen anything like that. -You look even better than last year. Hello, Pallieter. You don't even see that in America. Has Pallieter been up to no good again? -That rascal gives me such a hard time. -You should take him to the doctor. This is no way for a person to behave. Aunt Virginie, that's what I said, but when an idea enters his head… It's not in his behind. -You haven't changed a bit. -You're a right one. -Those mirrors outside are convenient. -Now you can shave in the outdoors. Marie, look how you've grown. What a beautiful girl you've become. Don't you agree, Pallieter? Milk and sugar bread, Charlotte. Let me take a good look at you. All that is missing are wings. Like that. Saint Anthony, and you, too, Bartholomew. Now they can all see Our Lady. There she is, everyone. Get ready. She's coming. -Hurry. -Be careful. I want to stand on the bench, too. Charlotte, are you alright? -Why wouldn't I be? -You look so pale and out of breath. -That's my second breath. -Hey, stay at the back. That's not your spot. Then your congregation should move faster. Move. Pallieter, come here. Stop that. Oh brother, isn't this awful? Our beautiful procession. You're not made of sugar, are you? What's good for the land is good for us. My corset is soaking wet. I'm soaking wet, too. Should I bewail that? Marie, go home, quickly. You'll catch a cold. Pallieter, stop driving her wild with your silly antics. Look, Marie, this is my most beautiful room. The sky is my ceiling, the sun my carpet. The rain is my curtains. But there's no woman in my bed. It is time. -The soup is there. -Finally. I was starting to get rather hungry. There they are. Bravo. -Charel gets all the balls again. -I want three balls, too. Three, isn't that one too many? -Three balls… -Start eating. Go on. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive others. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. -Enjoy your meal. -Enjoy your meal. I see some people who aren't doing their best. Who are leaving all that food that Charlotte has worked so hard on. I don't believe you'll have enough food, because I'm far from finished. I'm talking about the dessert, Uncle Manu. There. You all know that the one at our table who's eaten the least… has to sit in a dish of rice pudding with his bare behind. That's Charel. Yes, it's Charel. He's hardly eaten anything. He didn't even try the black pudding. But I have stomach problems. The doctor says I must not eat too much. Doesn't matter. Then you shouldn't have come to the fair. Into the pudding you go. Into the pudding. -It's Charel's turn to sit in the pudding. -Yes, in the pudding. Come on, take off your trousers I'm going to piss my pants. Father. Marie? Too bad it wasn't you. Do you mean that? Children, come on. Go on, inside. Come on. Marie, what are you doing? I have to ask you a very serious question. Is my bed big enough for the two of us? What do you mean? I'm going to marry Pallieter. In four weeks' time. You? Oh Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. You're going to marry our Pallieter. Father… Do you have permission to do this? Don't you understand Flemish? Get out of here, or I'll book you. A person can play the organ if he or she wants to. In urban areas that is only permitted if they have permission from the council or if they don't ask for any money. Is that all? Madam, may I give your organ a swirl? Thank you, madam. I'm playing this organ for my own pleasure and I'm not asking for any money. Is that in line with regulations? I believe so. But don't go asking for money. Constable, I have enough money. Too much, even. That's a different story. If you have too much money. -Enjoy yourselves. -And now dance, everyone. Ah, Pallieter, how are you? Have you come for your girlfriend? She's not home. She said: "If that lout comes over, tell him I have another boyfriend." Marie has gone for a walk. In the meadow, with her cousins. -Come in and have a beer. -A nice strong beer. No thanks, uncle Harry. Maybe later. Marie? Marie? Marie, my darling, where are you? Go away, you wretch. Stay there. Pallieter, go away. Please? -Let me get dressed. -It's too beautiful, my angel. Tears? None of that. -Can I go now? -Why, my love? I left my knickers over there. You immodest girl. Aren't you ashamed? -Let's go and get them. -Turn round first. Marie. Pallieter. Marie. -Pallieter. -Marie. The trees have spoken. Let's go to the inn. Which inn? And I brought something with me… that will look nice in the bedroom. What is it? Look. What do you think of it? And now: one, two, three. -And it starts snowing. -But the snow is sawdust. Don't sneer like that. Marie will think it's beautiful. Isn't it beautiful, Fransoo? Isn't it magnificent? When you're too old to play with dolls, you can play with Our Lady. I'll never give you a present again. How dare you talk like that about my Lady, who cost 60 centimes. In Scherpenheuvel. Charlotte. It's the nicest present I've ever been given. Is that true? Don't be fooled, Marie. Soon he won't be able to fool her anymore. Marie, you can still change your mind and find someone better. How, Jules? I got married this morning. That's not an obstacle these days. Verdonck, is this the place for such talk? Just joking, Father. You socialist. Three drummers came from the east Three drummers came from the east Boom, boom. They came from the east One of the three saw a lovely girl… Magda, will you come with me? Happy, Marie? -You're coming back, right? -No, I'm not coming back. -But the party isn't over yet. -It is for me. What do you mean? Oh, I understand. You're right, Marie. If I were you, I'd have left with him hours ago. -And my Charel is so far away. -Crazy girl. -Tired? -On a day like today? Not in the slightest. Come on then. There they are. Look. Marie, here you are. Have a good journey. Bye, Pallieter. Bye. Pallieter. Thanks, Fransoo. Thank you. For everything. I finally have you to myself. Come with me. Hello, Pallieter. How are you? It's getting colder, isn't it? -Yes, but I can keep myself warm. -We're going to the high field. You know my son. And this is Mrs. Elewijck and baron Verschaege de Denterghem. Gontrand has told us a lot about you and your house. We couldn't contain our curiosity. And I must say, the house is charming. A bit eccentric, but charming. It's a lot like Pallieter himself. Before you, my friends, you see something that is rather exceptional these days. An example of a free man. Who doesn't work, doesn't study. Who just lives from one day to the next. Right, Pallieter? A true idler. So? We didn't exaggerate, did we? What terrible taste. You have to be a genius for that. But, my dear friend, to live like this you must be very rich, no? -I couldn't afford to. -Yes, Pallieter is well off. And soon he'll be even richer. How is that, Mr. Count? -When they lay the iron road. -Iron road? What iron road? Don't you know? The iron road to Antwerp. I saw the plans at the Ministry of Infrastructure. Luckily for you, your garden is right in the middle. Yes, Pallieter, that compulsory purchase will make you very rich. Compulsory purchase? With that money you can make your castle even bigger, even more beautiful. God bloody damnit. God bloody damnit. God bloody damnit. Everything is ruined. Down the drain. That's it for our countryside. Farewell, beautiful countryside. I'm not living in a place like that. No way. You don't believe me? You'll see. I don't dare tell Marie yet, but we're leaving. Like the birds. The world is big enough. Where did those wretches come from? From Leuven. -Where are you taking them? -To be slaughtered, of course. Go on, giddy-up. Go on, giddy-up. Go on. Damn you. Move. What's the matter with you? Goddamnit. Bloody hell. What do you want from us? We don't even know you. We're from Leuven. What did we ever do to you? Pallieter, what's the matter? -What happened to your eye? -Nothing. He's hurt. What happened? I walked into a tree. You look awful. Fighting like a street urchin at your age. -You should've seen the other two. -That's no way to behave. Especially for an expectant father. -What did you say? -Charlotte? You promised you wouldn't tell him. -Sweetheart, is it true? -I wanted to tell you tonight. In bed. Charlotte, get some raisin bread, gingerbread, and burgundy for my son. -Or daughter. -Son or daughter. And get the pastor. -You want to have it christened already? -And fetch Fransoo. I must tell him. Be careful. Don't be too wild. She's right. I have to be careful with you and our child. -Come on, let's dance. -Yes. Is the wine good, Fransoo? It's a wine from the time of Jesus. "I hear the sound of horns and evening is approaching for me." -What did you say, Father? -It's a poem by Guido Gezelle. -He was a pastor too, wasn't he? -Yes, but a different kind. How does it continue, Father? "Children, happy and blonde, come, evening is approaching. Come to me. Bless the Most High, for evening is approaching. Come to me. I hear the sound of horns and evening is approaching… for me." I didn't know you knew any poems by heart. At least a hundred. I've never heard you recite any of those poems. No, it's from before, from my previous life. -Let's not talk about that. -Why? Because it's far too sad. With me, you'll never be sad again. -Pallieter. -P-A-L… Another long L. Shame on you, doing that in such beautiful snow. Stop it. Sir, Madam, we are the three kings. We have a star and we know a nice song. You guys, the three kings? No way, you're not dressed up. But sir, we don't have money for that. And we can't see each other anyway, can we? Come in. It's warmer inside. -And we'll help you collect lots of money. -How? That would be amazing, sir. It's a bit itchy, sir. A man has to suffer if he wants to look good. Who'd have thought we would look so good tonight? There, now you're a real king. The black king, Balthasar. And who am I, sir? Caspar, of course. A blind man can see that. Yes, but we can't. That's true. Christ, you smell like a woman. Hey, our box. Our money box. There it is. I was worried for a moment. Well, kings from the East… Watch out. Turn around. Turn round. Now you can sing. Right. One, two, three. The shepherds lay by night They lay by night in the field They faithfully kept watch They had counted their sheep Then they heard the angels singing Their songs loud and clear The shepherds went to Bethlehem… What shall I give them, brother? This is priceless. -Do you have any gingerbread? -Brother, what are you doing? Here you are, Your Majesties. -It's meat. -It's an animal. It's a pig. These magnificent healthy trees for such a ridiculous price. -Don't miss your chance. -Eighteen. -Nineteen. -What kind of prices are those? Who will offer more for this magnificent wood? -Twenty. -Twenty to Sander. -Twenty-one. -Twenty-one to Vandersteen. Who bids more? -What are you going to do with them? -That's none of your business. Do you want them? -Twenty-two. - Twenty-two to Pallieter. Have you come to push up the price? -Twenty-five. -Twenty-five to Vandersteen. Thirty. -How much, Pallieter? -Are you deaf? -I said thirty. -Mr. Pallieter says thirty. -You're taking the food out of our mouths. -Thirty going once. He's going to build a fence in front of his mirrors. -Thirty going twice. -Thirty francs. -You can't make a profit from that. -Sold to Mr. Pallieter. My trees. My trees. Long after all the woods along the Nete have been felled, you'll still be here. I promise. Grow. Make leaves and nuts. Grow however you want, in all directions. All the birds can live in you. And you… you will grow old and fat, long after we are dead. You will come into bud long after we have perished. Oh, brother tree. -He's ready for the asylum. -And the cost of sawing, transportation… Hey, weirdo, maybe you can hang your mirrors in your trees. Long live the trees. Welcome, sir. You, friend of Bohumil. You, friend of our family. Friend of us all. Yes, my friend. The things Bohumil has seen… Many things. Sad things. Too many things. Too many. It's still quiet here. It's still good here, still beautiful. Brother's heart good too. Not so everywhere. Bohumil has seen poverty. With both eyes. And fire and smoke. A lot of pain. Pain and hardship. Everything is in here. Bohumil doesn't want to live there. People hurt each other. Be quiet. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to see with both eyes. Maybe sadness will come here, too. Everywhere. Be quiet, Bohumil. Hey, Jaroslav, play something jolly. Something to drink to. Something to dance to. Something for the heart, Jaroslav. I can't believe what I'm seeing. -It's better than any angel. -It's more like a devil. -It might fall on our house. -It's coming down. It's landing in our field. I'm going to have a look. What do you think, Pallieter? How can something like that fly? They almost ended up in the Nete. Those men know what they're doing. You can see that. What would it cost for you to take me up in your machine? It's not that simple. I suppose you think it's as simple as getting on a tram? Where do you want to go? America? I'd like to see the Nete from above. -Are you not scared? -Now you ask me? No, it's great. No, no. No, no. -What's wrong with him? -He didn't enjoy it. You're so quiet, brother. You didn't enjoy flying. That's normal. If the Lord had wanted man to fly, He'd have given us wings. And the two us feared for your life. The three of you. That's true. Was it beautiful up there? You have no idea. It was… It was magnificent. We should thank God on our bare knees for putting us on such a beautiful earth. Which is why we're not staying here by the Nete. This tiny piece of the world is too small. And not just that. They're going to tear this small corner of the world apart. They're going to turn the Nete into a canal. They're going to build stinking factories among our apple trees. They're going to… -Charlotte, pour us a drink. -What are you going to drink to now? To us leaving. We're going out into the world, like storks. What do you think, Marie? As long as I can stay with you, you can take me to the end of the world. What about me? If we're going travelling we won't need a maid. What? I can't come? I can't come. You'd send me away, like an orphan. I knew it. Is that the thanks I get after everything I've done for you? The one who held you in her arms when you were a baby. Charlotte. What would we do without you? -Of course you can come. -Who's going to cook for you? Who knows what strange food you'll find in foreign lands? What clothes should I take? My black pleated skirt, perhaps. -Come on, let's check the wardrobe. -My black rabbit-fur coat. You have to be careful at my age. Before you know it you'll have bronchitis. Father, something we can't even imagine is hanging over us. Here, lad. Here's to your journey around the world. If I wasn't so old I'd come with you. Believe me. -What about your cassock? -True. I'd forgotten about that. -And your rose garden? -And your parish? And the Beguines? -I almost forgot my Saint Anthony statue. -Imagine that. What did you say? You almost forgot the patron saint of lost objects? Imagine that. Good thing you're taking it, it's easy to lose things when you travel. -And don't forget to send us a nice card. -Come on. Marie, I hope you have a whole beehive of children. -God be with you, darling. -I'd loved to have become a Beguine. But then who will take care of Marie's baby? We'll pray every week, Charlotte. Every Wednesday evening. Why are you all standing there? Is anyone coming with us? You might marry a Chinese. Won't you consider my offer? It's a very good offer. You'll never get a better one. You'll never get that from a compulsory purchase. You're not getting it, Vandersteen. Pallieter, what are you doing? Do you know where you're going? To where the visor of your cap points. To Wiekevorst? What? To Wiekevorst? To Egypt. The flight to Egypt. Subtitle translation by: Christine Le Piez
