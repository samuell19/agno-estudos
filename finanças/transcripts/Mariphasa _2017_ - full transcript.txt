I told you, she wants nothing to do with you. Do you hear me? Remember this, Nuno... Nuno is the guy who got injured, he did nights before you. It's unsafe down there. Once I stuck a nail in my foot, I had to have an injection, tetanus and all that shit… So, he keeps this car in the warehouses, He needs to get the engine running, but it has to be done at night so as not to draw attention. Nuno. Car. Battery. Garages. Paulo, right? Ok then. Unlike fire weapons, knives provide chirurgical precision. Using knives to fight requires a thorough knowledge of human anatomy so that we can… Watch out! - You stink of horse, dude! - Stink of horse, yeah? - Filipe, go get the bag! - Time to disband, everyone! Get the bag! Make yourself useful. Piss off! I'll come by your house next week to screw Laurinda, ok then?! You wished… She fancies men, dude. Hey, look after yourself. Hey Paiva, that was awesome - “RESPECT!” C'mon, I got people waiting! Good night. Good night. Shushh! I'll get your owner! I'll get your owner! If my father was here... I'll get your owner! "Those thieves, hum?!" "More than ten bandits!" Mum! Mum, mum! Muumm! Muumm! Suddenly a gentleman appeared, a boy riding a skate, and he almost ran you over and then then he held a gun… - You're hurting me… …and fired at me. My eyes cracked but I felt I was still alive. Only... it was as if I wore a mask, but not really a mask. I could see myself. But listen… Yes? That didn't really happen, did it? It happened in my mind, inside my head. But it didn't happen out here, right? No. - That's ok then. Let's get back to bed, ok? No. Come on… They told you mum had died, but I didn't. Mum ran away because I wanted to. Did you come to take Rui? I'll let them know you have permission to leave school. We really miss your daughter. Maybe I should tell you that it was only an accident, that these things happen. But she died in your arms, right? There was nothing... left. I don't get it. How can you bear it? How come you haven't sorted yourself yet? Do you get me? It's ready. Here's the lock, assembled. And here's your bill. All's working. That wasn't easy but we managed it. It's all set. You've got a good lock now, hey? And new safety latches! I changed the mortise, reinforced it, it's all good now. You can relax. We had to change a few things, the latches. It wasn't easy, but it's done. It's all here. Let me just try it out. Here's the key. The key. All the best. Good luck. Thank you. Bye now. Are you coming in or not? You didn't have to. Nowadays, thieves do more than just the robbery. I was worried about you. How are you? I'm fine. This doesn't bother you anymore, does it? It wasn't even one of our best days! Well, you won't be able to prepare it. I'll help you. Have you got a knife? - Your dinner will go cold. - No, it's ok. It's just for me. I'll warm it up. Can I use vinegar in the salad? - Don't you have a sharper knife? - No, that's all there is. Leave it alone, you may catch a disease!! Vinegar in the salad - yes or no? No. No? No. This will do. I'll take this one. These fuckers want to kick me out, But I know all about this shit hole. I spend more time here than in my shitty home! Cool! And one more. Where's the stuff I left here… Where's my little treat? Damn, I can hardly move with this on. Yes, streaky bacon, and I had pork steaks too. Not bad, this is something at least. And a cake! Hello. Hello? Hello? Can you hear me or not? I passed... the reptiles, I passed the reptiles section. I'm lost. See what you've done? Are you happy now? "General First aid" "Electric currents…" "Contact with an electric arc discharge will result in accident and burns…" "Burns… First, wash and rub your hands…" "Kneel next to the victim, lift with one hand…" You're not throwing this out, are you? Goodbye.
