It was a bird. We can't drive like that. A bird broke the windshield. We can't drive with a shattered windshield. Let's turn back. I thought I heard a bang. But I would never have thought that's what it was. Poor thing probably got lost. What a terrible death. Are you a believer? Because let me tell you something this strange is the work of the Saint. Who? Difunta Correa, my dear. Have you ever seen a seagull flying over the desert? Attention all passengers. Please, over here. Come here. Come on, people. Please pay attention. We've managed to add a bus going to San Juan City at 11 PM. You must all be here at that time, ticket in hand. We apologize for any inconvenience. - No other option? - No, there are no more buses. Her husband was in the military. Big and tall. A handsome man. They're a great couple, you'll love them. Other hand. It's a nice neighborhood. Rodrigo has pictures. But it's far from here. No, it's not far. Don't say it is, because it's not. These days 600 miles is nothing. I can't afford to keep you anymore. Rodrigo can't either... Dammit! Leave it, leave it. Go ahead, do your job. Good evening. Do you have calling cards? - At the next stand. - Oh, okay. - Good evening, calling cards? - Yes. Can I have one please? - The cheapest is 20 pesos. - That's fine. Where's the telephone? Go up those steps, back to the right, you'll see it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Goodbye. Hello, Mrs. Monica? This is the Cid family's maid. Yes, I just wanted to tell you the bus broke down, and we're behind schedule. No, but I'll arrive late. I'm waiting for the next bus. Yes, I have it written down. No, don't worry. I'll be there. See you soon. Looking for something? There's a closeout sale. Look at this. It just got in. Look how pretty. No, thank you. I've something better for you. - No, sir. No need. - Let me show you. Take a look at this. This would go great with the color of your eyes. I am Gringo. They call me that, I am not a gringo. Your name? My name? Teresa. What are you doing here, Teresa? Did you come to see the Saint? I'm just passing through. Go to the dressing room. Try it on. It'll only be two minutes. Try it on in the dressing room. Go on. If you need anything, just call my name: Gringo. I'm sorry, ma'am, but a storm is coming. I have to leave now. Of course, yes. Let me help you. - It doesn't fit. Thank you. - Too bad. Sir! My bag! Sir! Excuse me. Can I ask you a question? Do you know where vendors here go when they close? I have no idea. Excuse me. Oh, I thought everyone was gone. Come back tomorrow, I open at 8:00. No, I just need to ask you a question. Tomorrow at 8:00. No, now, ma'am, please. I need to ask you about a vendor. One that was selling saints or dresses, I don't remember. I need to find him because he left with my bag, with all my things. Really? That's strange. No one steals around here. - Do you know them? - Who? The vendors! Do you know them? Not all of them, dear. Look, just stay calm. The wind will stop soon. The vendors will be back tomorrow. Come early, try a dress on. We have sleeveless, princess cut, embroidered. The Saint is miraculous. You'll get married for sure. Good morning, Rubén. - Did they tell you I was coming? - Yes. I have it ready. Follow me. - Can you give me a hand? - Of course. Just push it this way. That's it. Slowly. Watch your hands. If you need me to recommend you in the neighborhood, I can speak very highly of you. That's not necessary, thank you. I don't want to be nosy, but if you get fired, I have a cousin who received great compensation. I can give you the lawyer's number. He's a great guy. I just did a job for him, a big job at his house. Thank you, that won't be necessary. I haven't been fired, I'm still with the family. You're still with the family? So we'll see you around the neighborhood. Where are you going? To San Juan. San Juan! It's beautiful. The mountains... I almost went once. I've never been. What are you going to do there? I'm going to... Do you know Rodrigo's wife, Diana? Rodrigo's wife? No. I'll work for her parents. They need someone trustworthy to... A companion! - Excuse me. - Yes, I'm leaving. I have to answer that. I'm looking for a vendor who has a van and sells clothes. Gringo, maybe? No, I haven't seen him today. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Good morning, ma'am. I'm looking for Gringo. - Do you know him? - He's usually at Muela's place. Muela's place? Where is that? Can you hear me? Nothing. But I'm still delayed. As soon as I can, I'll let you know when I arrive. Ah yes. Yes. But the weather is fine now. It stopped raining. Where is that piece of shit? Good morning. Mr. Muela? Who's looking? Teresa. Teresa who? Godoy. What's it about? A private matter. He's not in. I wasn't actually looking for him. I was looking for Gringo. Do you know him? Gringo? Yes! - So, you're looking for Gringo? - Yes. You should've started there. Of course I know him. You said Muela. Teresa... Godoy. And I thought... What did you do this time, stupid? It's just that... sometimes... It scared me, as you don't always recall everything you do. You understand? I am Muela. Nice to meet you. So... Gringo... has gotten into trouble. Actually, he has something that I lost. I was told I could find him here. No need to explain. His things are his, mine are mine, and yours are yours. He's here, the bum. Here? Look. You go through there, go around the shop, you'll get to the spa. The spa? The van is parked there. I'll go with you. No thanks, I've got it. I'll go with you. Let's go. You're from Chile, right? I'm also from Chile. From San Fernando in the Colchagua province. Right this way. What about you? Illapel. How nice. Let's see if Gringo is here. There he is. Hey, Gringo. Someone's looking for you. She says you have something of hers. Me? I'll leave you guys alone. If you need me... I came from the Sanctuary. Last night, when I went inside your van, I left my bag. Your bag? Yes, do you remember? When I went inside. You don't remember? No, I didn't see it. That can't be. What did it look like? Gray. With a handle. Big. Medium. I don't know. Do you mind if we take a look? Not at all, come on. - Where? - There. Over there. I don't see anything here. I left it over there. Come on up then and see if you can find it. Be careful there. Excuse me. It's not here. I'm sure that I left it here. I don't know what to tell you. - Anything important in the bag? - Well, yes. All my things. I'm sure. I left it there. The only thing I can think of, don't get your hopes up, is that I unloaded it without realizing with the merchandise yesterday. - You think so? - Who knows? With all the boxes, the storm, the rush. That's the only thing I can think of. If you are sure you left it and it's not here now. No, I'm sure. I can take you there to see if you can find it. And is it very far? I unloaded merchandise in a couple of places. I must tell you it's only a hunch, I didn't see it. I have money to pay you. We can talk about that later. Let me finish here, and we can leave. Excuse me. Thank you, Gringo. I'll wait for you here. Do you mind? It's a local station. They play nice music. What are you doing here? Nothing. You're on vacation? No. It lost the signal. It will come back. So then? I came to help at a family friend's house. I thought you were on vacation. Where are you from? Don't tell me. From Neuquen? From Mendoza? Not there either. From Brazil? Tell me. Where are you from? You haven't been on the road much. If the copilot won't speak, at least they can make some maté. I wasn't expecting to be a copilot. I don't drink maté and don't talk much. Do you sing or dance? I'm just trying to make the trip more agreeable. I'm going to roll down the window. Go ahead. Hello. How's it going? Give me a minute. Where are the boxes? I left them in the back. Show me. She had an accident and is about to die. Really? What happened? A car ran over her on the highway. Poor thing. Can I help you? I know lots about these things. Are you a doctor? A nurse. First thing we'll do is set the leg and use this ribbon to hold it with a bow. Like this and she'll be just fine. - What's her name? - Mariana. Give her food and lots of water. She'll be fine. Damián, go inside! Right now or you'll get it. Bye. It's not here. Let's go. Lunch is almost ready. I'm hungry. Did you find the boxes? I'll look for them later. And my mom? She went out. Set the table. I spoke to Diana's parents. We'll visit you soon. During vacations? January, probably. We'll see. Will you set the table? - I'll take them. - Let me. I'll do it. - Wait, come here. - What? Right there. Wait. Heels back. Come on. Done? It's a lot. Lucky for me. Nothing at all. Must be because of the storm. I have to go to the bathroom. Really bad? Well, look. There's a service station, but it's not too close. The van's bathroom doesn't work, so I'd recommend... It looks like she needs to go the bathroom too. She could've taken you. The only other option is... No. I'd rather wait. Let's go then. Look. I have the perfect shoes for you. Size 6. Made in USA, try them on. Thank you. I have some more colorful ones, but these are prettier. No, they're... they're nice. Very comfortable. How much do I owe you? Nothing. I'll put them on your account. Take a stroll and see how they fit. Come on. Look at those ankles. You hid them well. They're pretty, if a man's opinion matters... Come on! There's a beautiful view up there. Now let's see if we're in shape. Let's go back down. Let's go. Dammit! Are you okay? Are you hurt? I have very low pain tolerance. It could have been worse. And then I couldn't have fixed it. You're a professional. Don't try to be humble. Ready. Can we start over? Miguel Alfredo Corbalan, at your service. I can get everything there. If they order in advance, I can get anything. Anything. That's why I'm famous in the north. Because of my special merchandise. It went to your head, Gringo. You even have children's toys. Domestic and imported. So you travel all the time. Almost. Almost. When I am not selling at the sanctuary, I'm traveling. Finding merchandise. But where do you live? I'm not from here or from there, like the song says. You and I... we're just two stones in the road. Did the Saint ever answer your prayers? To tell the truth, not yet. Why do you believe then? I've been selling at the sanctuary for years. Many years. I only cared about the money. Nothing else. But life sometimes has a way of changing your mind. So every day, I saw... people coming to show their gratitude to the Saint. Their love. And their pain, too. And the Saint always gave them hope. So I started thinking she must have something powerful. I don't know. So I gradually started to believe, without realizing it. It helps to believe in something. It's strange that it's closed. We'll go to the house, it's nearby. Wait for me here. Come on down for a minute. I'll be a while because he's in bed. Come on, get up for a minute. I want to introduce you to someone. Let's go. This is Teresa, a friend. I'm sorry to welcome you like this but I don't feel good today. Please. Sit down. You were fine yesterday, and today you're a wreck. I'm getting old, Miguelito. Don't scold me. You went partying. I'm not scolding you. You play, you pay. Did you take your medicine? No, I forgot. Where did you put it? It's there, in the fridge. In the fridge? - Who told you to put it there? - You did. Why would I tell you to put the pills in the fridge? You're going to drive me crazy. Here you go. Take it now. I'll go check for your stuff. Wait for me here. Are these the keys to the shop? I'll go look for her stuff. Listen. I'll leave you here with this beauty for you to admire. Behave yourself. Sit. This is the first time Miguelito has brought a friend here. Well, I'm not a friend of Miguel. He's helping me because I had a problem with my things. Miguel is always helping. He's a good guy. I barely know him, but yes. He seems like it. The shop was his idea. To keep me busy. Did you meet selling merchandise? No, not at all. Hold on one second. - You need help? - No, thanks. Look. That's Miguelito's first picture. It shows how long I've known him. I can't say his age because he doesn't like it. He's vain like that. A lovely baby. Take a look at this one. So handsome, right? Women lined up just to give him a kiss. If he didn't marry, it wasn't for lack of opportunities. I should've warned you to run if he got out this box. Marito, you're making me look bad. Not at all. He showed me this one too. But that's not me. Granted, this one's not bad. Drop the publicity act old man. And for you, I have bad news. Your bag is not here. What bag? It's not here. Should we have dinner? Okay. Take the keys. They'll be at the terminal at 9:30 PM. If you arrive early, wait for them. Okay. Take this. I saved our numbers just in case. Call me when you get there. Hello, Rodri... Hello Rodrigo, this is Teresa. I wanted to let you know I arrived in San Juan. And that I'm using a borrowed phone because there's no signal. I love you so much, my dear. He came to see me at work. He knelt down and asked me to marry him. I knew she liked sailors, so I bought a sailor costume. I couldn't believe it. I showed up at the hospital, as she said. When she saw me, she started crying. Well, I was embarrassed. That's why she was crying. I came close to her, knelt down, pulled out the ring, and asked her to marry me. If she had said no, you'd have gone back to your submarine. I still have the costume. - Really? - I still do. And it still fits. - We use it, now and then. - All right, Coqui. Very good. In private. Well, you know, we were all after Shorty. - Shorty? - Shorty girl, here. She chose Coqui, and that ended that. What do you want? He's got the most beautiful eyes in the world. No offense, cousin, but I've got you beat there. You have other qualities. Like what? I don't know. What do you think Teresa? I must have something. I don't know. His smile. Yes, he has a smile that lights up the room. Stop it. It's not fair. You get off so easy. I had to dress like a sailor. We all have our own battles. Do you want some more wine? I'm going to San Juan. No, Teresa, look at the time. I have to go. It's late. How will you get there? I'll take you. Wait. You found your bag. Stop for a second. Teresa, please. Please. I found your bag. Where? When did you find it? - Why didn't you tell me? - I don't know. I do know. You looked so comfortable. Having a good time. And I thought: "When this woman gets her bag, "she'll leave." Or won't you? Tell me where you want to go. I'll take you. I'll wait for you in the van. Please. And there he was. So little! Trying to catch the birds as they were flying from side to side. There was no way we could put them back into their cage. So I opened the door and let them fly away. Rodrigo cried. He was afraid that his dad would scold him. He was an angry man. - Did he tell on you? - Never! We kept the secret forever. Why did you move here from Chile? But that's a longer story. Let's break this watch so we'll have all the time in the world. Well, it's not that long. My parents died in the earthquake when I was little. And I went to live with my uncle. He was a truck driver. He transported apples, twice a year, from Chile to Buenos Aires. One day he told me about a job with a family. Someone he knew that needed someone trustworthy to take care of their child. I was kind of lost. They offered me good money. And I went. I was just 20 years old when I started working in that house. And I never left. I don't think I could spend so much time in one place. I can't imagine it. In spirit, I mean. You never get tired of moving from place to place? You don't get tired of staying still? Let's have a toast. I'll start. Maybe I can inspire you. To this day. To the highway. And to the Saint. She did something for me. Now it's your turn. A toast to my bag, and to not having paid you yet. What a tasteless toast. I can let the second one slide, not the first. Now you have to drink the whole thing. Just one sip. Two. I don't know if I told you that I tend to get lost in the music. I don't want to lose myself. Will you give me your hand? Will you excuse me? I'll be right back. What are you doing? You tell me. What shall I do? In this sky THE DESERT BRIDE I am lonely I go walking With my soul The horizon Sings its voice I am still dreaming With my heart I walk the road I know the sun And at night I go with the moon I fly alone I am lonely I wait alone I am alone. This is my destiny Cluster of love Sweet caress That life changed Sweet caress That life changed In this sky The horizon My destiny My path English adaptation: Edwin Arévalo and Andrea Mickus
