This programme contains some strong language The woman who inspired the songwriter and poet Leonard Cohen to write some of his best-known work has died. So Long, Marianne, and Bird On The Wire were written decades ago for Cohen's then-lover and muse, Marianne Ihlen. They split up, but when Marianne grew ill and near death with leukaemia, her close friend, Jan Christian Mollestad, contacted Leonard Cohen. Less than two hours later, a message came back, which Jan read to her. Dearest, Marianne. I'm just a little bit behind you, close enough to take your hand. I've never forgotten your love and your beauty. But you know that. I don't have to say more. Well, safe travels, old friend. See you down the road. Endless love and gratitude, your Leonard. CHEERING I wrote this for Marianne. I hope she's here. Maybe she's here. I hope she's here. Marianne. This song is called So Long, Marianne. And a girl called Marianne that I know very well, she came to me after I sang for her first, and she said - she's a Norwegian - she said, "I'm certainly glad that song wasn't written for me." I said, "Oh, yeah?" And she said, "Yeah, cos, my name is 'Marianna'." APPLAUSE # Come over to the window my little darling # I'd like to try to read your palm # I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy # Before I let you take me home... # This is Marianne filmed on the island of Hydra in the early '60s. She said the song So Long, Marianne was originally called Come On, Marianne, and was not her favourite song. She said it was not originally intended as a goodbye. It came in actuality to foreshadow the end of Marianne and Leonard's relationship as lovers. This is little Axel, Marianne's seven-year-old son. It looks like some kind of a lobster. It has all kinds of... It was the '60s, and a time of free love and open marriage, including Leonard and Marianne's. I was a rather lost 20-year-old, visiting the island of Hydra, when Marianne befriended me. For a short while, I became one of her lovers. She encouraged me to follow my dreams and she played me Leonard's songs under the Greek moon and stars. Her smile and enthusiasm were one of a kind, and I felt completely intoxicated by the beauty of their relationship. LEONARD: I just left one day and I won a prize for a book that I wrote. They gave me some money, and then I got on a plane, and came eventually to Greece and got on a boat. And I just saw this island that was so beautiful. You know, I come from a country where it's cold and there's snow half the year. And I saw this island, you know, completely shining. I just got off, met a girl there, and I stayed. There were just a few foreigners there in those days. And the Johnstons were central figures. They were older, they were doing what we all want to do, which was to write, and to make a living out of writing. And they were there and they were very wonderful, colourful, hospitable people. And they helped me settle in. They really helped me out. That was first what made him an outcast in Montreal. It was the journey into the dark, because nobody wanted to go there. And I remember my mother writing me some horrible things about him. He knew the dark, he knew the struggle, from moment to moment. You were supposed to find a mate and get married and live in Westmount. They all stayed in Westmount. So we, we left. We had our own way of being. We found our own lives, but they turned out to be synchronistic. Can I have a sip? I'll have to even all of them. LEONARD: The days were very, very orderly. We'd get up early, and have breakfast, and I'd go to work, and a sandwich would be brought to me. I think I was on speed, too, so I wasn't eating very much. And that's the day, we'd proceed like that. I had a quota, I think it was three pages a day. She was beautiful, but she didn't really enjoy being beautiful before she met Leonard, and he made her love living. She felt that not only did Leonard see her, but he really loved her, and he really made her feel beautiful. I think if you should really understand Marianne you have to understand her first husband, Axel. Axel could get so angry. So he would throw out the furniture from the window and out in the street. I don't think he ever hit her. But he was violent. Leonard was the one who came into Marianne's life, who had watched the relationship breaking down. Leonard saved her life. And he went into a kind of role as a kind of helping hand. He helped with little Axel, and he helped her with talking and practical things. He was the father in the real sense. And little Axel still is talking about Leonard as a very good force. He's a very smart kid. He was very quiet, maybe a bit shy even. LEONARD: Axel and I would just, we would roam the hills. We would find fossils and... I lived there from the time that I was three months old. We used to run around barefoot. That slightly powdery feeling of the dried sea water on the stones. Every part of it is beautiful, in every season, at any time of the day or night. The freshly baked bread and things like that. I mean, I've never experienced those things anywhere else. Even the air has a kind of, you can sort of feel the air, especially in the evening. It's feels, like, sort of silky, wrapped in something silky and velvety. There was so much freedom there that people just went too far with it. So, there was always that danger hanging over people. I was mesmerised by the island's beauty, and had never before met so many golden sun-kissed people of either sex having so much fun together. It felt like anything was possible. Marianne gave me my first acid trip, which she said had come from a friend of Leonard's in London, called Malcolm, and she took these pictures of me the morning after. I had no intention of leaving, but then one of Marianne's other lovers unexpectedly showed up on the island, and I found myself hastily boarding the next boat back to Athens. My enthusiasm for Hydra, however, remained undiminished. I suggested to Rick, my best friend from school, that he go there as a break from a hectic career as a journalist. Rick intended to go for two weeks, but ended up staying for 14 years. I came to Hydra, which you recommended, and suddenly had a enormous sense of relief, because it was a combination, I think, of beauty, the beauty of the place, the simplicity of the place, and the genuineness of the environment. It was just a small group of artists who were either refugees of some kind or another. And you could live so cheaply, then. Leonard didn't have much money back then, and there was an unwritten rule, certainly back when I was first on Hydra, that if you saw someone like Leonard at a table, you didn't assume you could go and sit with them. They were there to be alone, and remain alone, and they were doing their writing A large part of my life was escaping. Whatever it was, even if the situation looked good, I had to escape, because it didn't look good to me. So, it was a selfish life and, but it didn't seem so at the time, it just seemed a matter of survival. You know, I guess it gets uprooted. People close to me suffered because I was always leaving. I was always trying to get away. I was very much encouraged by a friend of mine by the name of Irving Layton, influenced by his manner. After he asked me what I'm doing, he'd always say, "Leonard, are you sure you're doing the wrong thing?" And that really struck home, that really sounded right. And Cohen's concern is my renunciation of the Canadian public. Is this true, or are do you have some other concern, Mr Cohen, that you'd like to get off your chest right now? When I get up in the morning, my real concern is to discover whether or not I'm in a state of grace. What do you think Leonard loved so much about Irving? He loved his intellect, he loved his imagination, and he felt that Irving was the real thing, in terms of poetry. And the very first time I saw Leonard, Irving said, "I'm going to ask this man to come around, this boy man." I think he was 19, 20. And I said, "Who is he?" And he said, "He's the real thing." They each thought of each other as the real thing. They also had a very strong Jewish connection. That was a very strong thing in Irving's life, a very strong thing in Leonard's life. Leonard was an aristocratic Jew. Leonard came from a wealthy family, very well-rooted in Canadian culture. He came from an educated family, highly educated family. I never knew Leonard's father, of course, who died when Leonard was young, but his mother, Masha, was as mad as a hatter. Really mad. She had a thing about Irving. I wouldn't be at all surprised... Leonard and I would laugh about it, whether Irving and Masha ever actually went to bed together. Irving went to bed with everybody. Why not Leonard's mother? I mean, and she was very attracted to Irving. And Irving might... She was very beautiful, but mad. I think really great writers have to have mad, Oedipally-mad mothers. And if that's the case, then that's what he had. I mean, I know that a lot of my love of music comes from my mother, who had a lovely voice. She was Russian, and she sang songs around the house, and I know that those changes, those melodies touched me very much and that's certainly an influence. And she would sing with us. I'd take my guitar to a restaurant with my friends, and my mother would come in and we'd often sang all night. We're winning! We're winning! We're winning the eternal battle, we're keeping the party going. # We're keeping the party going. # He loved women. No question about it. But he needed to be his own person, in his own way. So he could love women from a distance and love them when they came through. He could make women feel good about themselves. And that's how he loved them. That's how he loved them. But he couldn't give himself to them, because he couldn't give himself away. I was not satisfied with my life at all. I didn't know what to do. I was the only one who didn't paint, write, sculpt. So everybody was artists. Lots of people came off the boat to Hydra. Jacqueline Kennedy was there, Princess Margaret was there. So what could I say? So, finally, I would say, "I am an artist. "Life is an art. "I'm living." Not very original. I was looking at myself and saying, "Everything is wrong with me", you know? So, it's a pity. Marianne had been the one to support Leonard through the nightmare of writing his last novel, Beautiful Losers, on Hydra. I wrote a lot of books there, and a lot of songs. I published the novel, Beautiful Losers, but I really couldn't pay the rent. Oh, yeah. He went quite crazy. I mean, you'd have to be crazy to write Beautiful Losers, it's like a hallucinogenic madness. He used to stay out there under that hot Greek sun, and Marianne would make him little baskets of food and water, and drop them over to him. I mean, he wrote that book in a fever. So he would never have been able to do that anywhere else except that island. Leonard had always used acid. It just gave him that extra whoosh. It was just never just taking it to get out of oneself. It was very much to do with part of the spiritual search. It allowed him to go into his madness, I think, which he probably couldn't have done anywhere else. It allowed him to sit on his terrace in the sun, take acid and speed. Marianne, I mean, she used to say, I mean, you know she was there to sort of, not pick up the pieces, but to sort of hold the man that had driven himself to the Beautiful Losers, and writing those extraordinary pages, day after day, in the sun, lunatic that he was. To find something that really addresses my attention, I have to do a lot of endless versions. Anything I can bring to it, I try everything. Try to ignore it, try to address it, try to get high. Try to get intoxicated, try to get sober, you know? And all the versions of myself that I can summon are summoned to participate in this...this word force. So, uh, I try...I try everything. I'll do anything. But listen to what some of the critics said about his latest book... After I finished Beautiful Losers, I thought that I would go into music. I wasn't really making a living as a writer. It was very hard to support and feed the hungry mouths that I was obliged to do. So I came back to America, and I didn't know what had been happening in New York in...in folk music. I was completely unaware of people like Phil Ochs or Dylan or Joan Baez. Leonard found me. And he came to my apartment, and he came in, and we had some coffee. And I said, "So?" and he said, "Well, I can't sing, "and I can't play the guitar, "and I don't know if this is a song." And then he played me... # Suzanne takes you down to her place by the river... # So I said, "Leonard, that is the song! "That's a song and I have to record that immediately." So, he and I... Of course, I recorded it right away. We became friends. He was quite clear that he never, ever wanted to sing in public. So, about a year went by and Suzanne was a big song by then. And I was doing a big fundraiser in New York and I said, "You have to come with me. "I want to put you on stage and I want you to sing Suzanne. "Everybody is dying to hear you sing this song." He said, "I can't sing. I have a horrible voice." I said, "You don't have a horrible voice." So he came out and he stood in the middle there and began singing the song. And I knew that he was shaking like a leaf because I had seen him, seen his hands on the guitar. In the middle of Suzanne, he broke down and began to sob... ..and walked off the stage. He was dying of fear. He was having what we know as a great massive attack of...of stage fright. So he came off the stage and I said, "Leonard, this just will not do. "You have to go back. I'll go back with you. "And we can do the song together." He said, finally, he said, "OK." So, meantime, the whole audience is continuing to clap and scream and carry on because they've gotten a taste. They could hear him sing. They knew. So we went out together, he finished the song and, by the time we finished, he was a convert. A total convert to his own magical impression. I would like to introduce to you Mr Leonard Cohen. # Suzanne takes you down # To her place near the river # You can hear the boats go by # You can spend the night beside her # And you know she's half-crazy # But that's why you wanna to be there # And she feeds you tea and oranges # That come all the way from China... # It was one of the most important moments of his life and mine. And of course, then he was off to the races. Columbia signed him up and was his label forever. I remember her arriving at the airport. She had two heavy valises in each hand. She couldn't wave to me because she couldn't lift the suitcases up and she didn't want to drop them, she was moving. So she waved to me with her foot. And I remember that very, very clearly. Yeah, boy, that was a mistake. You know, and said famously, you know, the famous thing, "I want my woman!" I mean, that was Leonard. "I want my woman and my child to come to Montreal." And that was this wonderful thing. And, of course, the minute he said it, he didn't... He wouldn't have... He didn't need it any more! He needed to say it. And Marianne, who was deeply in love with him, did come and brought Little Axel, we always used to call him Little Axel, and, um, it was a disaster. It was very unhappy. A very unhappy time. Axel would come and stay with us. He used to take a pencil and pencil his name over every wall in our apartment. And you were, "Axel. Axel. Axel!" That was a very unhappy time. Poets do not make great husbands...do they? Do you know of a poet who's ever made an absolutely splendid husband? Or a film-maker or an artist? No. You can't own them. You can't even own a bit of them. They're...they're just elusive creatures... ..who are married to their... ..to their muse. That sounds so pretentious to say that, but it's true. But the irony is, a man like that... ..is a man who other... That every woman wants to have. And can't have. Marianne came up to me and she said, "We were very happy living in Hydra. "And we were walking on the beach, and we were swimming in the nude "and drinking a lot of retsina and we were very happy. "And then one day he came to me and he said, 'Marianne, I'm going to New York "'to play my songs for Judy Collins.' "And you recorded all of his songs, "and I just wanted to tell you that you ruined my life." Certainly, their dream life in Hydra had a big interruption, which was that Leonard discovered himself as a singer. I took this picture of Marianne in the autumn of 1968, when she came to the UK and contacted me. She'd come to bring Little Axel to boarding school and needed a lift. We drove down to Suffolk to Summerhill, the A S Neill school, where children didn't have to attend class if they didn't want to. Axel was eight and I remember how upset he was when we drove away. Axel would write to Marianne nearly every day. Marianne was in tears, too, but believed it was the best thing for him because she was always travelling. Marianne came and stayed for a while in my less-than-chic squat in Kentish Town, where she took this photo. She introduced me to the world of protest movements and artists using their art to achieve incredible things. She was close to Julie Felix, the singer, an old friend of hers and Leonard's. And, working with Julie as her muse, encouraging her to write her own songs for the very first time. Julie had originally met Leonard on Hydra before either of them were singers. Well, I'm very happy and proud to have him here on the show and introduce him to the English public. Here is the writer, the poet, the songwriter. He's a friend, but he says he's a stranger in this song. Ladies and gentlemen, Leonard Cohen. APPLAUSE MUSIC: The Stranger Song # It's true that all the men you knew # Were dealers who said they were through with dealing # Every time you gave them shelter # I know that kind of man # It's hard to hold the hand of anyone # Who's reaching for the sky... # Leonard was always searching, and this feeling of never belonging anywhere, and even in a relationship, you know, eventually with Marianne, I think that was the longest relationship... But after that, he went from relationship to relationship. And at the end of the song, there was just a tear in his eye. He was an emotional man. APPLAUSE Well, at that time, they were already having a few problems. Marianne and I hung out together for quite a while and we became very close and we went on a couple of trips together. And she was the muse and said, you know, "Why don't you write?" And the first song I wrote was Windy Morning, which is a song that she kind of...guided me through. She was a great muse, wasn't she? Absolutely. Absolutely. And I think...I think Leonard honoured that, you know? He said that she was, you know, when...when, um... ..when he was speaking of her. Well, she was so encouraging. Yeah. And she was so nurturing, you know? It's uh... Yeah, it's...it's that, you know, the woman power, the...the ability to nurture and love and... ..and encourage, you know? It's something the world needs. That's why I think it's good that we're getting to women's time, finally, with all the Time's Up, and Leonard was a great, uh... ..feminist, you know. He really... He said to me once, cos I was talking about something, He said, "I can't wait till women take over." So that was...that was kind of nice to hear from him. Leonard's imagery came from the poets, from Shakespeare, from Keats, from Marlowe. So I found certain lines in his guitar playing that I could enrich. And I decided not to do it with instruments, but to do it with female voices, since so much of his writing was about his relationships with women. There was a very female presence in all of his songs, even though he was a man. So, my girlfriend at the time had a very nice, pure soprano voice, and so I started, you know, fooling around, asking her, "Sing this, sing this, you know, over Leonard's song. "What do you think?" And, uh... ..some of it sounded really great. You can't sort of imitate it, slightly? HE CHUCKLES I'm not a singer. I don't know. She was singing... # So long, Marianne... # She added a little... SINGS HIGH NOTE ..on the top. # It's time that we began to laugh # And cry # And laugh # And cry # About it all again. # So, she sort of aped what he was doing, but it gave it a little harder... Put a little harder edge on it, you know? # So long, Marianne # It's time that we began # To laugh # To cry # And laugh and cry and laugh # Oh, oh, oh # So long, Marianne... # The very first time I met Leonard Cohen, he opened the door and he's absolutely naked as a jaybird. Right? So, me coming out of where I come out of, I go, "This is pretty damn weird." You know? "This is..." Later, of course, throughout the time I spent with Leonard, the years that we worked together... When I look back on all that and if I had have been involved enough at that moment, it wouldn't have been weird to me at all. All the time I knew Leonard, he was very, very conscious of his body. Leonard used to say that, "When we're on tour "and you get... We're at the hotel, take all your clothes off. "You're going to be passing by these things called mirrors, right? "And when you pass by a mirror, you're going to notice "that little... 'Hey, I need to be doing a few more sit-ups.'" Leonard swam, like, all the time. Any hotel we were in, you would find, if they had...if they had a pool, he was in it, and he would get up early in the morning so he didn't have to run into anybody. He'd be down there at five o'clock in the morning, and he'd be doing laps. And if they would let him swim nude, he would swim nude. I don't know why. That was just him. Didn't you write a song with him? I did, yeah. I wrote Chelsea Hotel with him. We boarded an airplane in La Guardia and me and Leonard sat there and worked on this song. I had no idea who he was talking to in his writing, at the time. It came out later that it was about Janis Joplin. And, you know, like the... It's, like... # I remember you well at the Chelsea Hotel # Talking so brave and so sweet # Giving me head on the unmade bed # While the limousines wait in the street... # That's all still there. Nobody knows that the second verse was... # I remember you well at the Chelsea Hotel # In the winter of 1967 # My friends of that year # They were all turning queer # And me, I was just getting even. # # I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel. # You were talking so brave and so sweet # Giving me head # On an unmade bed # While the limousines # Wait in the street. # At that time, Leonard had some experiences with Janis Joplin. All these things. And Marianne was living separately in her apartment, with Little Axel. That must've been, uh... ..very strange. But she was still the muse. And the interesting thing is that... ..she has read for me the telegrams... ..from Leonard. First, the telegrams to... .."Marianne Cohen". Was just like they have been married! Telegrams going to Hydra and then to London and then to New York. First, it's in the period when they are together as a couple. But the beautiful thing is when... ..they're not a couple any more, he's still sending money. He's still asking how Axel... ..is doing. And so he continues to send his small... ..er... ..love messages. Even if they're not together. Leonard said he was suffering from depression that he fought for so many years. So Leonard decided... He thought, well, it'd be a nice thing for us to do, is that we blow in...say, we blew into London to play the Royal Albert Hall. "Well, we got three or four days here, why don't we, "one evening, go out and play at a mental institution?" OK. So, of course, that went over like a fart in a diver's helmet with me because I wasn't about to go out to any... I was not going. No way. He said, you know, "Just go one time." He said, "If you go one time and don't want to play "any more of these, then you don't have to do it, right?" So I said, "OK." So I went... Well, I'm going to tell you this. By the time that night was over... ..you couldn't drive me away from that idea. And we ended up playing a lot of them. He had a grandfather or something like that that I think died in one of those institutions. There are a number of reasons why I played in the hospitals. You know, when you play for somebody who has really been defeated... ..and it was my feeling that the elements of his defeat corresponded with certain elements that produced my song and that there would be an empathy. I mean, I feel that I also have an empathy with this experience. LAUGHTER # I loved you in the morning # Our kisses deep and warm # Your hair upon the pillow # Like a sleepy golden storm # Yes, many loved before us... # That was a moment in my life that I would never forget. This guy, he stands up and starts screaming. You know, "Hey, shut it down. Stop. Shut it..." Well, we, you know... ..being musicians and having played a million shows, we steam right on, right. We're not going to let it... Well, no, this guy shut it down. He shut it down. And then Leonard finally said, "OK, you talk", right. So this guy said, "Look..." He said, "You come in here... "..and you've got all these shiny guitars "and you get all...and you've got the pretty girls there "singing background stuff and everything." He said, "I want to know, what do you think about me? "That's what I want to know about. "I want to know what you think about me." You could hear a pin drop in that place. And Leonard just walked past me and Charlie, walked down the stairs, walked right out in the crowd and just hugged him like you wouldn't believe. He almost broke his ribs, he hugged him that hard. ..You don't see any more? Pardon? Not somebody? When we go to Geneva. No, I mean now. Now? No. No, tonight. Would you like to listen? Yes. I don't have any plans. You don't have any place? No, I don't have any place here. Do you have somewhere for me? Yes, a lot. OK. It's hard to come on to a girl in front of the camera. What? I was obsessed by, erm... ..gaining women's favours, at a certain point in my life, and way beyond any reasonable... ..erm... ..activity. It became the most important thing in my life and it led me into very obsessive behaviour and some very interesting things, and probably most of the things I learned about myself and about other people were gained from this period of obsessive... ..this blue movie that I threw myself into. But we know that blue movies are not romantic. It was a show with more women than men. It was like, you look out there and there were some couples and it was mostly just women. They read his poetry, right, and then they see him sing these songs and they're all just down there crying and all, but watching him. There was no problem with women. You know, I'll tell you a funny story. One day, I'm down in the lobby of the Mayfair Hotel and he comes walking in from the cab with this really nice-looking woman and they disappear. Come down a couple of hours later and they're having drinks in the lobby. This bar there. And she leaves, and then he makes a phone call. About a half hour later, he comes back with a different woman and they go up - they're gone. This is one afternoon. Hello. How are you? He had to have a woman all the time. This guy travelled the world. He knew women and people in Paris and London and all those places, right. He'd go, let me just call so and so. Yeah, yeah. There was no problem there. In fact, everybody was doing pretty good. Even me. Oh, yeah. CHEERING I had a great appetite for the company of women and for the sexual expression of friendship and I was very fortunate because it was the '60s. And that possibility was very, very present and, for a tiny moment in social history, there was a tremendous cooperation between men and women about that particular item. And so I was very lucky that my appetite coincided with this very rare... What? Religious? Social? I don't know what you'd call it. Some kind of phenomenon that allowed men and women, boys and girls, we were, to come together in that kind of union that satisfied both the appetites. CHEERING # Like a bird # On the wire # Like a drunk in some old midnight choir # I have tried # In my way # To be free... # CHEERING AND APPLAUSE I felt much more that Bird On The Wire had something to do with me because I was there. When you see it in the light of how it began... ..it was when the new electricity came to Hydra. I gave him the guitar, we looked out of the window, we saw the birds landing on the wires and he had not been able to create or write or sing or do anything for weeks, and he was in a very, very, deep, deep depression. And it also was a period in my life where I had to... ..make a decision that was pretty hard. And that was following... ..my intuition... ..and decide that Leonard and I was not going to have any children together. SHE SOBS Marianne came and visited me in Cardiff, where I was a student living down by the docks. I was concerned she might get bored. But Marianne was naturally interested in everyone. She regarded being receptive and open as the highest of qualities. Marianne made friends with all the kids in the street, who followed her around all day, and she encouraged me to make my very first film on slum clearance as the whole community was being torn down. Marianne liked to throw the I Ching every day and get stoned. She talked about Leonard a lot. His favourite salt beef sandwich shop in Piccadilly. His spiritual search, even dabbling in Scientology and Est. Marianne, too, was on her own spiritual search, and Leonard was in many ways her teacher. One day, she asked me to drive her to Bath. She said she was pregnant with Leonard's child. I think she was preg... ..or she WAS pregnant to Cohen, but she knew that Leonard didn't want children, and she had abortions, even though she would have... She, if anyone should have should have had Leonard's children, she deserved to have them. But she didn't, for Leonard's sake. But, you know, she wanted what I wanted. She wanted... ..to... ..she wanted to be with him, and you cannot be with Leonard... ..in that sense, although you could say that I'd rather have one day or one night with Leonard than a lifetime with somebody else, that would be easy to say. But it's not... ..it's not so easy. You know, I could have said that with Irving, just to be... I was with Irving for over 20 years. Whatever the ups and downs, how wonderful it was, and it WAS, but most of that time was anguish, you can't... Anguish? Well, you know, it was the days of open marriage, whatever the hell that was, and I don't think it EVER was successful with anybody. One of the partners was always jealous, and angry, and hurt and confused. I don't know any child who came out not damaged by that period of time. We just wanted to do it all, take drugs, and fuck around, and do whatever we... And the children were just... They came along on the ride. They didn't want to come along on that ride. There are a lot of us who grew up very quickly on the island. There's also a lot of acid on the island, like, people were actually dropping acid into people's drinks, and I remember hearing reports of people having donkeys, they were riding donkeys that, like, started tripping and getting into all kinds of trouble and accidents, right... They gave acid to the donkeys? Yeah, as well as to people. I got, erm, someone put acid in one of my drinks, when I was about 13, and I had no idea what was happening. Also, a lot of casualties happened. I think Marianne, and a lot of other women, were not as nurturing to their children, perhaps, or as present with them as they could have been. Axel was really a casualty of that. Marianne was going from one love to another, to another, and often he wasn't with her, you know, so who was he with? And Leonard, you know, he wasn't Leonard's kid. He started wearing long, you know, flowing Moroccan robes, and he was silent for years, and then later he became institutionalised. But I've always felt very sad that he's been, you know, institutionalised for most of his adult life. Those who could work with Hydra did really well, and there weren't many, quite frankly. I saw so many artists who came and either just found their creativity just wasn't strong enough to sustain them, or the booze, the sex, the beauty of the landscape was all too much, and they just gave up, erm, but Leonard was one of those who, who, somehow, the whole environment, I think, sort of coalesced, and worked for him, and he worked with it. Ha! Still... # I got a home in glory land # That outshines the sun # I got a home in glory land # That outshines the sun # I got a home in glory land # That outshines the sun # O, do, Lord, O, do, Lord... # He was a real success story. He really was. He wasn't damaged by that place, I think, at all. Many other people seemed to come away from that place sort of irreparably... ..damaged, and it was terrible on marriages. Very few marriages lasted that place, including my parents'. I remember Marianne telling me of the tragedy of the Johnstons, the family that Leonard had originally stayed with in 1960, who left the island after nine years. This family of such amazing talent and promise, and they just kind of all fell to bits shortly after leaving the island. It's my birthday today, and this is a wonderful homecoming, and that was a photograph, a family one, taken on my birthday last year, on the island. THE CHILDREN SPEAK GREEK They always speak Greek among themselves. I think it comes more naturally to them, and they've done all their schooling in Greek, ten years. When they left, almost penniless, she killed herself, like, a couple of years later. He died a year after that, of tuberculosis, probably greatly compounded by cigarettes and alcohol. And then the children that had, that seemed so, you know, glorious and beautiful and bright and wonderful on the island, they, one by one, died early, of alcoholism, suicide, drugs. It's only one that's alive. Numerous other children from families that had lived on Hydra have had a hard time re-entering the real world. I think there is a depression that sets in if you've spent any time there. I've certainly felt it. There's not a day that goes by that I don't wake up and wish that I were there, you know? Literally. I never wanted to be any other place in the world, you know? It's just the place. It's just the place, you know, er, you... It gets in your bones. I don't know how to describe it, but it's just the place. Just stepping off the boat, every time, it's coming home. CHEERING ELECTRICAL FIZZING That was a very weird, weird night. There were 660,000 people out there. It was a disturbing night. They even caught the stage on fire, had to put the stage out before we went on. Maybe we ought to get out of here, you know, somebody's going to get hurt! Leonard embraced it. He got into it. like I was saying before, you either get him or you don't. He got it. Well, I was on Mandrax at the time. they used to call me Captain Mandrax. I think it had... It was like a Quaalude, right, I was relaxed beyond any reasonable state. I hope she's here, Marianne. I hope she's here. Maybe she's here. I hope she's here. Marianne. # An old woman gave us shelter # Kept us hidden in the garret # Then the soldiers came... # Marianne was one woman that didn't seem to me all starstruck over Leonard. Kind of held her own, put it that way, you know? She would join us, sometimes, for a week at a time, or maybe ten days at a time, and be gone. There was other ladies that Leonard had on tour, but when Marianne was in town, he was out of the picture. She carried with her a different feel than any woman that I ever saw around Leonard. CHEERING There was a need for such a connection between Leonard and his audience that would actually have blown your mind. One night, he had so many people come up on stage with him that it was like this big love-in right in the middle of our concert. Like a pile of people making love without taking their clothes off, but if we could have stuck around a while longer, who knows what would have happened. Can you imagine, we're playing Amsterdam, and he invites the entire audience to come home with us to his hotel. And they did it. We took a lot of acid on those trips, a lot. Leonard had a buddy in London and he had a thing called Desert Dust, and if you took a needle, and touch it to your tongue, and the tiniest little speck that you could pick up with that needle on your tongue, gone, I mean gone, for 14 hours, with no re-entry. None. One time, we took that, that damn Desert Dust 23 nights in a row, playing the Royal Albert Hall, and the Vienna Opera House, and all the fine places on the... We were, I mean, I, I've got to tell you, there's no way I could, I could ever even survive one of those nights, at this point. Got to see my text here. Hey! Knew I could count on you, baby! That's hot. This is the way it's got to be done. Think that stuff still works? I don't know. I'll be in serious trouble if it works or if it doesn't work! Leonard used to say, "You have to be in the zone." Well, we stayed in the zone. A lot of people think, like, well, if you burn it down really strong tonight, tomorrow morning, you've got that hangover, and all that... Uh-uh. We stayed in the zone. Day after day after day. There was only one night - we were playing in Jerusalem - when he wasn't getting them. Now, look, if it doesn't get any better, er, we'll just end the concert and I'll refund your money. Some nights, one is raised off the ground, and some nights, you just can't get off the ground, and there's no point lying about it. And tonight we just haven't been getting off the ground. So, anyway, we're backstage, and we're going, "Well, what's going to happen?", and Marty Machat, his manager, is trying to talk to him, and Leonard's just zinging, right? I knew that, and, er... How do you mean, "zinging"? I mean, like, on LSD. Like, his eyes are blacked out, like they get, right? And, er, he's just feeling... And so, all of a sudden, he says to me, he goes, "Billy, can you get me a razor?" I said, "Leonard, what are you going to do, cut your throat?" And he said, "No. I think if I shave, I might be able to go back out." And you got, this is the last concert. This is something you have to do and then, bang... Oh, I know what I have to do, I have to shave. What a life! What a life! Oh, this is wonderful. Why didn't you tell me about this? So that's what he did, he shaved, dry shaved, almost. Ha! Just some water, and then he went back out there with a big rash on his face and finished the show. You've got to try it, man, it's wonderful! Oh, yeah. Amazing. Oh, this is really great. # I saw Jesus on the cross # On a hill called Calvary # Do you hate mankind # For what they've done to you? # He said talk of love not hate... # Everybody was shooting from the hip, right? Not welded to any, any thing. The idea was that tonight we will play this song... ..better than we did last night. And tomorrow night we're going to play it better than we did tonight. # Sometimes happy, sometimes blue... # There was only one night, one night that I felt like that I let things get away from me. And I actually went for this beautiful chord, it was a F# minor 7th in...I think in the song called Suzanne. And as I went for that chord, I actually landed on my face on the ground...on the stage right there, and Leonard turned around and looked at me like, "OK. We need to now start backing off the Mandrax, right?" Marianne and I kept in touch during the '70s and '80s with the occasional postcard and letter. I was delighted when she suggested we might work together and we talked about various ideas. Marianne was increasingly concerned about Axel. He'd been on a trip to India and taken too many drugs. She was upset with Little Axel's father, who had encouraged him. Axel was now living in an institution in Oslo, and Marianne was spending more and more time with him. Marianne had still been following Leonard on his travels, and very infrequently they still shared the house together on Hydra. Apparently, Leonard was now living part of the year in Montreal with a woman called Suzanne. I've read three of his biographies and I've always been surprised that they sort of partition it as, like, here was Marianne and then that was over, and then he took up with Suzanne, but in fact, there was a considerable overlap of time, where he supported both families. He said that when he was with her and Axel in that house on Hydra, he felt that's where he belonged. But when he was with Suzanne and the baby in Montreal, he felt that's where he belonged. And so he was confused. Suzanne, she was much more visceral, in a way. And 14 years younger than him. So I guess there's a whole bunch of different things that conspired to... ..to make it come to an end. You needed somebody like Suzanne, who was, well, the word ruthless is just the word that comes to mind. And she did what she wanted to do to bind Leonard to her by any means... To use the Black Panther thing, by any means necessary. And boy, did she do... And she knew exactly what to do and when to do it. It was like falling into a spider's web and there was something... There's always something terribly fascinating about the spider. Very fascinating. And I think Leonard just fell into that... ..because it was so fascinating. I don't even know what drove that whole thing. But he knew, he knew he was.... As Irving, as Irving would say, "Make sure you do the wrong thing." Boy, did he make sure he did the wrong thing with Suzanne. settling down and having a home and a family and all that stuff. Leonard always had that feeling that he was after something that he couldn't get his hands around. The only thing about it is that I don't know what he... I don't think he knew what he was chasing, you know. I don't think he... I don't think he really knew. And that made it be probably a darker... You know, he lived in a... He lived in darkness. He disappeared for six weeks, sometimes. I wouldn't know how to find him or nothing. Nobody would, you know. And it was a deep, deep depression. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE When we toured Europe, when we toured Germany, I've never seen so many blondes in one audience. He was the poet for the quasi-depressed women of his era. People who were going through issues, they'd come up sobbing, "You saved my life. "I was in such a dark place and your darkness led me out of it." Thank you so much. He had his thing that he projected. He had his black suit. He had his look of seriousness and you never saw his humour. He was a really funny guy. But when he was on stage, it was dark and it was lonely. And it was desperate. ..Those who would sacrifice... ..one generation on behalf of another. # Well, the door it opened slowly # My father he came in # I was nine years old # And he stood so tall above me # And his blue eyes they were shining # And his voice was very cold... # I wanted to frame each of the songs like... ..a little vignette. They all had these places of mind, so I was giving them... Because we were using unusual instruments, which was a couple of trombones to take it somewhere or very icy strings. And dark shimmering things to make it these little, like little movies. And we came back and we were ready to do another couple of weeks in the studio and he said, "I'm going to go to Hydra for a little bit, and as soon as I get back, we'll finish it." And I didn't hear from him for... ..seven years. It turns out, Marty Machat, who was Leonard's manager, also managed Phil Spector, and he had made a deal for Phil with Warner Brothers that got them both a huge advance. Really huge advance for the '70s, it was unheard of. So what had happened was Marty called up Leonard and said, "Forget the record with John, we'll put that on the back burner. "We want you to do a record with Phil Spector. "He's really famous so it'll make you a hit." And of course, he made Death Of A Ladies' Man. Which, you know, is not his best work. That happened at a curious time in my life because I was at a very low point. My family was breaking up. I was living in Los Angeles, which was a foreign city to me. And I'd lost control, as I say, of my family, and my work, and my life, and it was a very, very dark period. And when he got into the studio it was clear that he was eccentric, but I didn't know that he was mad. The atmosphere was one of guns. I mean, that's really what was going on, was guns. The music was a subsidiary. People were armed to the teeth. All his friends, his bodyguards, you know, and everybody was drunk. So, you know, I mean, he was slipping over bullets. Biting into revolvers in your hamburger. I mean, Phil was beyond control. I remember Phil shoved a revolver into my neck and said, you know, "Leonard, I love you." I said, "I hope you do, Phil." I think that if anybody, you know, disappointed the project, it was me. I didn't have the chops to sing those songs. I think a song like Memories is a really dynamite tune. I think the tune is great. The lyric is touching, I think it really does come out of that high school gymnasium. # So won't you let me see # Won't you let me see # I said won't you let me see # Your naked body. # One day, Suzanne, with little Adam, the same age as my son, when I came back to Hydra, was standing on the doorway... ..wondering when I was moving out, so she could move in. I remember that... ..seeing her, I somehow felt a little bit taller, a little bit stronger, a little bit older, and a little bit wiser. I got hold of something when I saw her there with the baby, and then I very calmly packed up, took Axel and moved out. SIGHS Yeah. So Marianne finally decided that enough was enough and she did have to go back to Oslo. Her mother had always wanted her to. Wanted her to come here and have a normal life. Become a secretary. Receptionist, or something like that. And be normal. So Marianne finally decided, "Yeah, that's what I'm going to do." So she came back up here, became a secretary, married a Norwegian man and... ..became the stepmother to his children. Had a very average, ordinary life, and then every once in a while, she would go back to Hydra, visit her friends. Out of the blue... And I told you I had done Rebecca and never heard from Leonard again. I thought, "I did something. What did I do? I did something." He calls up, "Hey, man. How're you doing?" 1984. "Want to make a record?" I'm saying, "I've been waiting... Waiting for this phone call." So we went in the studio and we did Hallelujah fairly early, and he played it for me and it went... HE PLAYS ON PIANO: Hallelujah He had just bought a little Casio synthesiser on 7th Avenue and 49th Street - one of these Dinka-dinka-dinka-dinka-dink one-finger things. And he fell in love with it. He said, "I'm going to record this, use it for the track." So we put it down that way. We're saying, "Holy crap, man. This is really good. "We've done something here." Leonard was just grinning. Even Marty, who was reluctant to like anything I was involved in - just said, "This is... This is it." We bring him up to Columbia. There's a new guy named Walter Yetnikoff. This was his first big thing. And then he says, "No, I don't like this at all." And there's a famous quote - you know, "Leonard, I know you're great, but I don't know if you're any good." Something like that. And he says, "We're not going to release it." And Marty then later says, "John, I knew it. "You ruined Leonard's career! You have ruined... "This is an un-releasable record, it's the biggest disappointment in our lives. "I can't believe you did this to Leonard"- and he had loved it earlier in the day - and I'm saying, "Well, what do you mean?" He said, "No, they hate it. "They're not going to release it," at which point, he ceremoniously threw my contract in the garbage. I never got to sign it, and he said, "And you're not going to be working for Columbia any more." There was a couple other artists I was supposed to work with, and I was just... That was... That was it. I was done. In the morning, we thought we had this greatest of all Leonard Cohen records. And by the afternoon, I was out of the business. It was the end of the world. That's when the whole Mount Baldy thing happened. That's a huge phase in Leonard's life. I didn't see him. I got out of the record business, essentially, because of how this record went down. # Yes, and I've seen your flag on the marble arch # But love is not a victory march # It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah... # This record was monumentally important. It was the anthem of anthems. But to this day, I've yet to see any royalties. I think that, through all of this searching and searching for herself and for her identity through all those years - on Hydra and other places - and having had, you know, the first husband who was the writer and the second husband was the writer and singer, and never really knowing who she was except in comparison to them or somehow in relation to them. I think it took coming back here for her to really find herself. She was a really nice person - very kind and very generous. She really listened to you when you talked. Not a lot of people do that. Most people, when they're talking to you, they're kind of waiting till they can say their next line, you know. But she was really interested, and she really listened and she really thought about it. She was a very generous and kind person. I hadn't visited Hydra for 40 years. It had changed from the wondrous place you could live on $1,000 a year to the playground of the very rich. One of the only survivors of the old Hydra is Don Lowe, who lives up this path in this house without electricity or running water. Don prefers candles and has a well. Marianne introduced me to Don in 1968. He has since self-published over 30 books. Oh, there you are! HE CHUCKLES Don has lived on Hydra for 60 years. The last time he left the island was 25 years ago. I made this for my... I didn't want to get stuck and then got nowhere to live, you see. So... Wow, it's beautiful! It's nice, you see? Yeah. Dug it out. Did one of your children do that? No, I did that. DON LAUGHS You did that? It's beautiful. That's my idea of paradise. You can cook here and you can write a book here, if you are that way inclined. It's got a view... ..of the sea - and next door. This is where Marianne was going to stay, in the house there. Marianne was going to stay where, in the house...? Just there. You can see it through there. She was very nice at the end, Marianne. Because she mellowed and, you know... Cos it was never easy after Leonard - cos every time he gave a concert or something, she would get caught up in it. Every time he gave... Every time he gave a concert, she had an invitation. And she was interviewed in Norway and things like that, and so she couldn't really... She married a lovely guy afterwards, divorced him and married him again. And, yeah... A very sweet man - Norwegian. But, yeah. I got quite fond of her at the end, Marianne. I never had... When we were younger, we lived our own way. But in the end, she became very close. Mm. BELL RINGS CHANTING Had some wonderful moments on the road, you know, travelling with musicians and playing with the musicians. But, by and large, I didn't have what it took to really enjoy my success or my celebrity. I was never able to locate it. I was never able to use it. That's beautiful, huh? Doing what he did up there came natural to him cos of his discipline. He became a servant for years and years there. He had to get up, like, at 3:00 in the morning. Some of the things he told me that they did up there, I don't know if I coulda hung with that. Your small... Yeah. Your black bag? Yeah. Brown bag. What did I do with it? I just... Oh, in here, Roshi. In here. Ah! In here. My handbag... Your handbag... Yeah. ..is still in car? Yeah. OK. You want to eat something, Roshi? Eh? You want to eat something? Yeah, no... OK. OK. Roshi was his spiritual adviser, his Buddhist monk leader. He centred him. It was like having Mom and Dad watching you if you think you're likely to be tempted to stray. I think it was his crutch. And it also probably increased his focus and concentration. I'm trying to learn some things about love. Well, love is that activity that... ..that makes the power of man and woman... ..that incorporates it into your own heart, where you can embody man and woman, when you can embody hell and heaven, when you can reconcile and contain, when man and woman becomes your content. In other words, when your woman becomes your own content and you become her content, that's love. And you recognise the full equality of that exchange. Because if she's smaller than you, she can't fill you. And if you're larger than her, you can't fill her. So there has to be an understanding that there really is an absolute equality of power. Different kinds of power, obvious... Obviously, different kinds of magic, different kinds of strength different kinds of...movement that's as different as night and day. And it is night and day, and it is the moon and the sun, and it is the land and the sea, and it is plus and minus, it is heaven and hell. It is all those antinomies, but they're all equal. I have experienced it. I have experienced it. You don't have to change the world. There doesn't have to be any revolutions. I'm sure that everybody already knows about all that transpired along the way when he came back down off the mountain. He had no money, you know, because this person that he had trusted, a person that he would have taken a bullet for, so to speak - that's what he told me - that he spent holidays with, with her children and his children, had absolutely sold him out, and that it turned out that a friendship that he thought was the real deal ended up being a really bad thing. Well, the money seems to be gone. As far as the manager - you know, who was my dear friend... I'm still rather fond of her, but she... There's been a judgment of... ..several million dollars against her. But, you know, it's... She doesn't seem to have any money. It's impossible to collect it. I don't know. I guess I should be more worried than I am, but I... But I'm not, so what can I say? HE CHUCKLES You know. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE All of a sudden, here he is. He's now in his 70s, but he has no money now. He said to me, "All I can do is get out there and tour "and try to make some money." He said, "I don't know if I can do it or not." It's... It's been a long time since I stood on this stage in London. CHEERING It was about, about 14 or 15 years ago. I was... ..60 years old - just a kid with a crazy dream. LAUGHTER Suddenly, Leonard was the hottest ticket in town. And it went from our little tour bus, with two sound engineers and three roadies, to an entourage of 59 people on his own jet. # Show me slowly what I only know the limits of # And dance me to the end of love... # And he was making upwards of $15 million every year, one of the top-ten grossing acts. He went from literally being wiped out to incredible stardom. CROWD CHEERS MUSIC: So Long, Marianne by Leonard Cohen # Oh Marianne # It's time that we began # To laugh and cry # And cry and laugh about it all again... # It was a love story which had 50 chapters without being together. HE LAUGHS She had a compartment of her heart which was always married to Leonard. CROWD CHEERS That's the beauty of Marianne's and Leonard's history - that they had this place for each other... ..till the very end. And it's not the bitter end. It was a lovely end. It's a very beautiful end. Suddenly, one evening, I got an SMS saying, "I'm at hospital. "I'm going to die. Please take care of Little Axel and Jan, my husband." She asked me, "Could you... Could you tell Leonard?" And another thing she said was, "Could you bring a camera "because I still feel I have something to say? And in the morning, there was this lovely letter from Leonard to Marianne. "Dearest Marianne... "..I'm just a little behind you... "..close enough to take your hand. "This old body of mine has given up, as yours has too. "I've never forgotten your love and your beauty. "But you know that - I don't have to say more. "Safe travels, old friend. "See you down the road. "Endless love and gratitude, "your Leonard." THEY LAUGH And the beautiful thing was that this old sick man... ..reached his old sick lover... ..with a message that... ..she had always wanted to hear. And... ..I think that... ..for Marianne, this was a ring that started with leaving Oslo and going into the adventure with Axel and... ..meeting Leonard, losing Leonard... ..meeting Jan... ..having problems, of course, with her son. And then when this love letter came from Leonard... ..I think she felt that it was all completed. So... ..that's what words of love can do. Greece is a good place to look at the moon, isn't it? You can read by moonlight. You can read on the terrace. You can see a face as you saw it when you were young. There was good light then - oil lamps and candles. And those little flames that floated on a cork in olive oil. What I loved in my old life, I haven't forgotten. It lives in my spine. Marianne and the child. The days of kindness. It rises in my spine and it manifests as tears. I pray that loving memory exists for them too. The precious ones I overthrew for an education in the world.
