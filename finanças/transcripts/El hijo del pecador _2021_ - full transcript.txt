What’s up? What’s up with you, kid? – Look, such a cool ball I found! – Let’s play! What’s up? Do you want it? What’s up? The ball is mine, I’m not giving it to you. – No, It’s mine – No, no kid. Hey, guys! Look who’s coming to help, the cocky one in the bunch. – What are you doing here? Who do you think you are? – The ball. The ball? What about the ball, asshole? Step back! You’re the cocky one, aren’t you? Are you covering your little pal? The cocky one! Such a child face you have, don’t you? – What do you got there? – Nothing, nothing You sure you have nothing? You buffoon. Look, can you see it? You see it? It’s nice and sharp. Look what I do with it. Look at your ball. It’s gone, your ball. Listen to me. Next time I see you around I’ll cut your face. Ok? Is it clear? Now run. You piece of shit, go with your little mate. See you around again, I’ll kill you, fags! Why did you go out like that, it's really cold. Fasten your seatbelt. The whole afternoon. Don’t you really feel ashamed? Why should I put up with this. My God. What have you done, Miguel? What have you done? Alejandra’s father has come shouting, looking for you. Saying you’re a degenerate, a pervert. That he will kill you if you’re not in jail, Miguel! Calm down, please. Calm down? She’s only 16, for God’s sake! What were you thinking about, Miguel? What were you thinking? Mom, what's wrong? Eat your chicken. Where are you going, Miguel? That’s it. That’s the way we solve problems in this house, right? Mom, who’s Alejandra? Can you correct it? – It’s right. – No! With the marker! Yes! Jorge? Jorge! – What’s up? – Make a banner that says: “Closed for family matters” Take it to the school. Get in without turning the lights on and stick it from the inside. But I didn’t have breakfast. Students come at 10 in the morning. Come here and take this, take this. Buy a roll for yourself, bring some bread and spare change. Where is Dad? CLOSED FOR FAMILY MATTERS Hello? Dad? Don’t you hear me, Dumbo? What are you doing with that? – Is dad back? – Yes, but he got in his bedroom and won't talk. Leave that or you’ll get hurt. But what is it now? I didn’t hurt you! It's mom! She says she isn’t buying my new books nor my new backpack. Without new books nor new backpack, I’m not going to school! Mom? Mom? Dad! Dad. I’m fine. I’m fine. Thanks, son. Thanks. – Son! Is he still in bed? – Yes. – He didn’t want me to call the doctor. – Jesus. Hello. My God, what have they done to him. Did he take any medicine? Pain pills. They gave me an ointment at the chemist’s. I can’t stand this any more. Son. Your father and I are going to separate. I hate you! I don’t want to be like dad, I don’t want to be like you. I hate you! Manuel. Throw it up, Manuel.
