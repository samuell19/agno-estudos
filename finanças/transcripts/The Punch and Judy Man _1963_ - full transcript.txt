(gentle instrumental music) (waves crashing softly) (tapping softly) (singing in foreign language) (upbeat band music) - [Radio Announcer] Well, that's all from me, housewives. I've really enjoyed my fortnight with you. Next week I'm off to entertain the lads in Kenya So if any of you have sons out there drop me a line. On Monday, my old mate Jerry Bishop will Be here to play your requests. So don't forget be nice to each other, Don't drive too fast and keep smiling. (cheery instrumental music) - [Radio Announcer] It's five to 10. Thou visiteth and blesseth the earth Thou makest it very plenteous Thou crownest the year with thy goodness And thy clouds drop fatness They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness And the little hills shall rejoice on every side The folds shall be full of sheep The valleys also shall stand so thick with corn That they shall laugh and sing - [Radio Announcer] And one day there came a traveller To the city of Jericho and he sat beneath a fig tree. He asked for a drink, but the women told him "There is enough for our needs but no more". The shade of the fig tree was cool, but the guardians of the law told him, "You did not plant the fig tree "neither did you nurture it "and the shade is not for you." The traveller moved on. In the wilderness he spread his rug And pressed his face to the sand. Far away he heard the music of the water and saw the fig tree's shade, and he murmured, "I understand, I understand." (dramatic orchestral music) (soft beeping) (upbeat rock and roll music) - [Radio Announcer] Hello, me old mates. For all of you from Bethnal Green to Brighton, Here's Vince Groyne and the Peers. (radio clicks) - Good luck. (utensil tinging) (pot clatters) (lid clatters) (newspaper rustles) (cereal clattering) (toy thuds) (milk splashing) (cereal crackles) (spoon rattles) (knife scraping) (teeth crunching) - Oh! I see Lord Purley's getting married again. I like the way he walks with his hands behind his back. - Who, Lord Purley? - No, him. I think it's ever so neat. The little boy does it too. Do you suppose he has lessons? - I haven't the faintest idea. (Delia laughs) What's the joke? - It's not a joke, but they do have such a good time. "Dublin rained bread rolls last night. "While corks popped beneath the chandeliers, "debs and their escorts pelted their partners "Across the dance floor. "Champagne cascaded from the balcony "And brought the cabaret to a full stop. "Said John Biffy Lauderdale, second cousin "to the Countess of Digbeth, "We thought the artists should get "their fair share of the champers." (Delia laughs) - What would you say if I was to behave like that? - You never would. Oh, Lady Jane Caterham was grounded at London airport yesterday when the bus carrying passengers From the Paris plane broke down 20 yards from reception. Nothing daunted, the controversial Lady Jane Got out and walked. - No! What, you mean she actually got out and walked? - Yes. - What do you mean putting one foot in front of the other and all that? Isn't that marvellous, I am deeply moved. - Well, it's different for her. She's a very busy woman. - Yeah, I'm sure. - And a very nice woman too. - [Wally] I have no doubt. - She's not a big stickup either. We asked her to turn on the illumination. She, she wrote back herself. - Really? Well, I'm sure we're all highly honoured. I can't wait. - Going to work then? - It's time. - You haven't folded your napkin. (fingers thudding) (dramatic instrumental music) (lips smack) (Wally sighs) (bell ringing) (chuckles) (bicycle bell rings) (door slams) - That's two more teeth gone. How do you expect an artist to work with material like this? - Not just now, please, Edward. - Oh. It's like that again, is it? - Like what? - There's a trough of low pressure coming up. - Yes, I heard. - There's a gale warning too. - Really? - All right for some though. Bournemouth had six point five hours of sunshine yesterday. - Did it? - Yeah, and it was up to 73 at Ramsgate. In the shade, that is. Very unusual for the time of year. - How absolutely fascinating. - Yes, you see it's all to do with this cold front Coming in from the Atlantic. - Get in the car. - But I'm waiting for these teeth to set. - Get in the car. - But I'm an artist. - And your public is waiting. Now will you please get in the car! - It's not loaded. - Well, why isn't it loaded? - Because I have these teeth to stick in. - Well, who cares about the teeth? - I care. - Well, I don't. I've got other things to worry about. - I was only speaking as an artist. - Edward, I have the greatest respect for you as an artist. I appreciate that a temperament such as yours Must be treated with tact and delicacy. Now will you please load up the car! - There's no need to shout. You only had to ask. (cheery instrumental music) We really must get this tuned, up you know. (bicycle bell ringing) (dramatic music) - Morning, Mr. Mayor! - That was Pinner, wasn't it? - I believe it was, Mr. Mayor. - We'll have to do something about him. (men chattering) Are we all present? - Mr. Collins isn't here. - Never mind him. Is everyone else here? -1 think so. - All right then. (bell dinging) - Gentlemen. Mr. Mayor. - Good morning, gentlemen. - [Men] Good morning, Mr. Mayor. - I'd just like to say a few words About next week's great gala occasion. (men mutter softly) As you all know, that distinguished personality, Lady Jane Caterham, has kindly consented to switch on the illuminations. And, though far from desiring the glare of publicity, I feel her gracious presence will help to put Piltdown on the map where it has rightly belonged for so many years. - [Men] Hear, hear. - Ah, but how much is it going to cost? - Mr. Edwards, this is no time for penny pinching. We've got 60 years of Piltdown to celebrate. And, if I may say so, I don't think any of us will come too badly out of it. - I think you've done very well, Mr. Mayor. - That's very nice of you, Fred. I feel we've all played our part although, of course, I can't say that for every element in the town. We've got a few people we could well do without. (cheery instrumental music) - What's it gonna do, Wal? - Rain! There's a drop of low pressure coming up! - How's the glass? - Going down! - It's coming from the West! - We'll have it by tea time! Hello, Dollie, anything for the 3:307? - Oh, go on. (laughing) - It was at 13:25 hours that Nelson was mortally wounded by a musket ball from the French ship as depicted in the scene and made, I might add, Entirely from sand and water. The French then attempted to board, but were driven back by officers and men who rushed up from the lower deck. Not long afterwards, the French ship... surrendered. The Victory was now little more than a wreck. Her hull severely damaged. Her rigging badly cut and few of her spars intact. Go away, will you, go away, go away! (dog snorts) Go on! (dog barks) Now, up to 15:50 hours, when he lost his power of speech, Nelson continued to receive reports of the battle and one of the last instructions To Captain Hardy was to anchor the fleet. Go on, now, would you please? Go away, go on, be off! This was also the occasion when the great admiral, mortally wounded and about to breathe his last, Called Captain Hardy to his side and whispered in his ear. Now some authorities have it that what he said was, "Kismet Hardy," which as the classical scholars Have it means fate. Others believe that what he actually said was, "Kiss me, Hardy." Which, of course, is quite another matter. (laughs) Well, at any rate, Admiral Nelson died at 16:40 hours. - Oh, he's really got 'em today. - Now, ladies and gentlemen, if you care to show your appreciation, you'll find a receptacle For coins just in front of the sculpture. Thank you very much. Thank you. - Madam, would you kindly remove that animal? Thank you very much. - Good morning! - Well, hello. - Force nine in the channel. Horatio's lookin' a bit rough today. You ought to shove Lady Hamilton in there. Brighten it up a bit. - That is hardly in keeping. - All right, please yourself. - Ah, sir, Madam, what about a little picture of the three of you with the little girl. What a lovely little kid she is. Bless her. That's right, big smile, sir. Memories of Piltdown. Shan't be a second. A little closer together. That's right, and smile, darling. You'll like Piltdown. I won't be a second now. Smile, darling, smile. That's it, any second now. Here we go. Oy, Ted! - Edward if you don't mind. - Would you mind getting that tent of yours out of the way? - Tent? Are you referring to this piece of theatrical equipment? - That thing you're carrying! It's ruining my sitting! - Sitting? You mean those snapshots? - Only amateurs take snapshots. I offer my customers a living likeness. Memories to cherish. Carefree days by the sea captured forever. - Come on, love. - Now look what you've done! Madam! Will you get out of the way, will you? Madam, sir, what about the little girl? Now don't be like that, Madam. - Am I bothering you? - No. - If you could see your way clear, Do you think we could possibly proceed to the beach? - All right then. - Thank you. (mallet banging) (mallet banging) - He's here again. (dramatic music) - Oh no! Not again, that's all we need! Come on, come on. Come on. Got the new swazzle. - How is it? - (high-pitched) What a pity, what a pity, what a pity! - Sounds all right. - Nothing like the old one, you know. - It's all right. - Yes. - Yes. - Oh well. Time? - It's almost time. - Overture. (cheery instrumental music) Right. Curtain. Here we are again! Hello! - [Children] Hello. - Hello. - [Children] Hello. Goodbye! (children laugh) My name is Joey the Clown and I'm very squeezed to meet you! Pleased to meet you. Would you like to see Mr. Punch? - [Children] Yes! - Mr. Punch? - [Punch] Yes? - Will you come upstairs? (squeaking) - Hello! Hello! - Hello, Mr. Punch. - Hello, Joey, hello! - Now I've got to go downstairs for a glass of bread and dripping. You stay here... (banging) And don't you go away. - All right! - Goodbye. (squeaking) - Goodbye! (Punch sings in squeaks) Hello! - [Children] Hello. - Judy? - [Judy] Yes? - Come on! - Here I am. - Oh, there's Judy! Judy, give us a kiss. - All right, stand over there. One. (Punch laughs) - Suppose you've seen quite a few changes in your time. - Yes, it's not the same you know. We used to do 10 shows a day. - Get away. - Mm. - Course, television killed it really. - (high-pitched) Oh, that was lovely! Just like having the tooth out! Mr. Punch, would you look after the baby? - What? - There you are. - Ooh, what a beautiful baby. - Now, Mr. Punch, would you nurse the baby for me? - Huh? - Be a good boy. - Huh? - [Judy] Bye-bye. - [Punch] Bye-bye. (Punch squeaks) - Watch it much? - What? - Television? - No, too much violence. Very bad for the kids. (stick banging) (Punch laughing) (people laughing) - [Punch] That's the way to do it. That's the way to do it. (Punch laughs) - There's no two ways about as far I can see. We've gotta move with the times. - [Men] Hear, hear. - Now then, is there any further business? - There's the question of decorations. - No question, surely they'll be worn. - Isn't it a little invidious? - What do you mean invidious? If you've won 'em you wear 'em. - Yes, well, they didn't pin them on everyone, you know. Some of us had to stay at home. - No one's getting at you, Jack. - Ah, there was a job of work to be done. I remember Winston coming down... - Alright, Jack, we all know. You're one of the unsung heroes. - Well, if it hadn't been for my leg. (men mutter) I can feel it now, just a touch of the East wind And it doesn't half give me gyp. - Yes, I don't know how you manage To get around those 36 holes every Sunday. (men laugh) Well, the doctor said I've got to keep moving. - You've always had to, haven't you, Jack? - I don't know what decorations you can put up, but I reckon if they'd known about your contribution To the war effort, they'd have sent you the iron cross! (men laugh) - Now look here, Jack! - [Mayor] All right, that's enough. - It's all very well, Arthur. - I said, that's enough. We've almost run into drinking time. - Yes. (Punch squeaks) - Come along, here we are. Three for, here we are. Three for. Ready in 24 hours, three for half a crown. Now come along now. Ah, you, sir. Smile! - Who killed Mr. Punch? - [Children] A skeleton. - A skellybones? - [Children] Yes, yes. - Oh, I don't like scallywagses. You won't ever get me. (squeaking) Where? (children shout) Too far. - Come along now, three for half crown. Ready in 24 hours. Get your photographs taken over here. - He's out there. - Who is? - Nevil. - Come along now, three for half a crown. - Go and get rid of him! I'll take that. - All right. - Fine, fine. All right. - [Child] Hello. - [Nevil] Here we are, Madam. Here we are, get your photographs taken here. Come along now. - He's out! (children shout) Where? - Come alone now. - A skallybone? - [Children] Yes! - Ah, here we are, Madam. Ready in 24 hours. Get your photographs taken over here. - Scallydog? - Yes! - Always here, memories of Piltdown. Get your photographs taken here. Come along, sir and madam. Why, look at that baby you've got there. - Look here, you're interrupting a public performance! - I'm not afraid of him! - Ready in 24 hours. Memories to cherish. - [Joey] You know what I'd do if I saw him? - [Children] No! - [Joey] I'd look him straight in the face And I'd say, now look here. - Ooooh! - Oh, he looks like a lump of ice cream. Here comes the coffin! (children laugh) There we are. Come on, Mr. Punch. In you go. Get your tootsie-wootsies in. Take him to the semitootery and we'll Sing a sad song to take him away. (Wally sings happily) (crowd applauding) (in high-pitched squeaks) What about that? What about that? Have you ever seen a worse example Of unprofessional behaviour in your life? Wandering about, hanging out cards like soap coupons. I'll kill the... - Hello there. How's it going at Trafalgar? - I don't like the look of it. (coins rattles) How did we do? Nevil Shanks, society photographer. Portraits by appointment or while you wait. I'll sort him out later. They all gone? - Think so. - I'll have a look. (playful music) Oh no! Trouble. - I'll have that. - Thank you. Well, what do you want? - You left the crocodile out. - Who did? - You left it out. - Well, who says he has to be in? - He's always in. - Well, he wasn't in this time. - Why not? - Because it has been a very difficult day! - Will he be in this afternoon? - If I want him to be in. - Well, I want him to be in. - Well, he probably will be in. - Good! - Well, er, I suggest we adjourn to the Trident. - Yes. Not for long, I told Delia I'd be back for lunch. (bell ringing) - Good morning. - Oh. Good morning, Mrs. Palmer. Irene, a chair for the Mayoress. - Now, it's about the gala night. There was something I meant to ask you. Now, what was it? - You thought I might be able to help with the tableaux. - Yes, well, I'm afraid that's all been arranged. - Oh, but you promised. - I'm sorry, my dear, but we had to get on with things and the Committee felt, in view of her experience, Miss Ripper should arrange the tableaux. She's very good at that sort of thing, you know. - Well, of course, if it's been arranged. - But I did have another suggestion. - Yes? - Well, I wondered if your husband Would care to entertain us. I mean, we are a seaside resort and it would Be so nice to have something of the spirit of the place. - Yes, well, I, I don't know. I'll have to ask him. - Must you? (sighs) What a pity. I've my list to finish today and I'm Afraid I really must know now. - Well, I, I really don't know. You see, he's very... - After all, my dear, it's quite an honour. We're having some very distinguished company. - Yes, I know, Lady Caterham. Oh, I think she's marvellous. I should love to meet her. - Well, I daresay that could be arranged if you speak to Mr. Pinner. - Well,... Yes, he'll do it. He'll be delighted to do it. - Gala Week, September the Fifth to the 12th. Carnivals, tableaux and illuminations. What a load of rubbish. I wouldn't be seen dead near that lot. - I think it might be rather gay. - Gay? Are you out of your mind? This is Piltdown Bay, the pearl of the Dogger Bank. You'll get no gaiety here. (men laugh) I'll lay you six to four that's the one about the Eskimo. - So the girl said to this Eskimo... (men laugh) Well, come on now, Fred. How did the meeting go this morning? - Well, I'm sworn to secrecy, of course, but between you and me and the cake post I think we should all do very nicely. - What'll you have? - Oh, I'll have another large pink gin, please. - If he must water the beer, I do wish he wouldn't use seawater. - I can't think why we come here. - All the best people come here. Ah. The society photographer. - Nice weather for ducks. Well, it's raining. - We know it's raining. - You all covered up? - Quite adequately. - Well, that's all right then, isn't it? - I'm surprised you've got the nerve to show your face in here after That little exhibition this morning. - Well, I'm temperamental. And it's all your fault anyway. - My fault? - You interfered with my pose. - I did not interfere with your pose. - Oh yes, you did. - Oh no, I didn't. - You and that tent of yours. - It is not a tent. - Well, whatever it is, it destroyed the mood. (tapping) - Are you buying the drinks then? - Well, of course. Good grief. (clears throat) - Service. - Be careful, he might hear you. (clears throat) (clears throat) Without wishing to interrupt your intellectual conversation, I wonder if you could see your way clear To providing a little service this side of the bar. - I'll be with you in a minute. - Do you mind? This is a private conversation. - Come here often? (shutter slams) Cheap dry return, workman's please. Normal service will be resumed as soon as possible. Seats at all prices. Try using your feet. - I'll get it! - Any more for the wall game? - All right, you've had your little joke. Standing on the furniture is not permitted! - Ah, mine host. Come landlord, fill the flowing bowl, the cup of good cheer. Let joy be un... - Never mind about that. Let us have you down. - If you insist. - I do insist. Interfering with the comfort of my clientele. Well, what's it to be anyway? - (stammers) What's it gonna be then? - A large whiskey. - I'll have a bitter. - A large whiskey, a small bitter. - A large bitter. - And I'll have a glass of Superb. - A large whiskey, a large bitter, A large glass of Superb, and half a pint of mild, please. I don't mind paying for your drink, But there's no need to go raving mad. - Under the circumstances, I think you've got off this very lightly. - Very lightly. - Oh yeah? Well, I've never seen you drink a whole pint of bitter before. - Well, you will now. - That'll be 10 and threepence if you please. (bell ringing) - Pelting down out there. Took me 10 minutes to get on a bus. - Oh. Oh, well, I suppose Mr. Pinner will be late. I better go and turn the oven down. - No, he can't be working. Not a soul on the front. - Oh. No, well, I suppose he's sheltering somewhere. Mr. Pinner knows how to take care of himself. - Well, cheerio then. - [Nevil] Cheers. (register dinging) (men chattering) - Well, what would you gentlemen like? - I'll have a pound out the till! (men laugh) - Hello, the Yaks are with us again. - The Yaks? - It's an organisation, Edward. - I've never met one. - Of course, you have, the place is stiff with them. Hang on. (knocking softly) (knocking) - Pardon me, is the Monarch of the Glen at home? (glass shattering) (men laugh) - That's nice, isn't it? Nice class of clientele you've got here. Breaking the place up. You wanna tell them to watch it. (men chuckle) Oh dear. Mm. Delicious. Well, I'd like to return the compliment. Unfortunately, I have to dash. Don't forget, up the Yaks! (whistling) - You know. - He really is a most amusing fellow. - Oh yes, very droll. (storm rages) (gentle instrumental music) - There's no point in hanging about, you know! You can't expect a performance When it's coming down like this. Well, can you? You better get off home then! All right, come on over here. Well, come on, I won't eat you. Why aren't you at home? - I'm waiting for it to stop. - Where do you live? - 42 Banjo Road. - That's on the bus route. - I haven't got any money. - How much is it? - Threepence, half price. - Here you are. Why not? - Mum said I wasn't to take money from strange men. - But I'm not a strange man. You see me every day of the week. This is ridiculous. - I'll give it to you back. - I should hope so. - Where's the bus stop? - In Market Street. - All right, I'll take you there. - There's no need! - I know there isn't, it's on my way. - All right then. (gentle music) - He is late, isn't he, Mrs. Pinner? Wouldn't have thought it would have taken him As long as this to get up from the front. - No, well, I expect he's discussing business. - Still, he might have let you know. - Have you brought those boxes up From the basement yet, Miss Foster? - No, Madam. - Well, would you do it? Now, please. (storm raging) (wind howling) - What's the matter, you hungry? - Yes. - All right, won't last long anyway. - Good afternoon. (hat slapping) Good afternoon. What's it to be? Shepherd's Delight, Sunset Special? Rainbow Treat or Hopskotch Dainty? - Oh, I'll just have a bowl of hot soup, I think, please. - We don't do soup, sir. - I'll just have a cup of tea. - We don't do tea either, sir. - Oh. Well, what would you like? - I'll have a Piltdown Glory. Two scoops of luscious vanilla. Two scoops of toasty chocolate. Succulent sliced banana, juicy peach fingers in pure cane Syrup swimming in super-smooth butter fat cream. Ooh, and a cherry! - And a cherry. And for you, sir? - The same. (spoon clatters) (contents rattle) (clears throat) (cheery instrumental music) (teeth crunching) - Straw please. (popping) - That's the way to do it. - Just a minute. Five shillings. (Wally chuckles) - [Man] There's only a few of you. Now's the time to get in. There's only a few of you. Bingo, now's the time to get in. Now drowning. Play it again, one line any way Or one on each in four corners, all right? Are you going to locate the first tunnel? (bell dinging) - Strong. - [Man] On the white 56, 56 on the white.

Come on. - [Man] Any moment now, it's gonna go back to the winner. - Here we are. - Thank you very much. - Afternoon. - Bye-bye. (bell rings) - Oh, we were wondering what happened to you? - Yes, I got held up. How is Mrs. Pinner? - Waiting. (dramatic music) - Mm-hmm. (suspenseful music) - Ooh! - Hello. - Do you know the time? - Yeah, I'm a bit late. I'm sorry. - You are precisely one hour and 10 minutes late. I suppose they haven't got clocks in your part of the town. - Yes, but I got a bit tied up, you know. - And you can tell the time? - Yes, I can tell the time. - Well, then, what happened? You were supposed to be back for lunch. I've been cooking there all morning. You've got no consideration. Not good manners. - Oh, yes, we know about manners. - You don't! - Of course, we don't all have the benefit Of your social contacts, do we? Is the wine quite chill enough, Madam? Is it quite satisfactory to the duchess? - Very funny. - How about a touch of pate? Nothing like it after a day on the moors. - When you're ready. Well, what's the matter with it? - Nothing, I just can't eat it, that's all. - Why not? - I just had a Piltdown Glory. - A what? - A Piltdown Glory. It's two scoops of luscious vanilla. Two scoops of flaky chocolate. Succulent sliced bananas all swimming In super-smooth butterfat cream. - I suppose I should ask why. - Yeah, well, there was this boy, you see, And he hadn't got his bus fare and it was raining. And there was a shop and we went in. - And you had a Piltdown Glory. You're supposed to be a grown man, responsible. When I married you, I thought you were gonna Make something of yourself, but you never did. We've traipsed around all these years. I've lost count of the furnished rooms we've Lived in with those dreadful theatricals. And now we've got a chance to put Down some roots among a nice class of people. Oh, don't you understand! If you want to get on in the world you've got to fit in with people. But you don't do anything, you leave it all to me. It's only because of me they put up with you at all. - Have my own friends. - Oh, that's not what I mean. I mean, the people that count in this town. It's only because of me they've asked you to do this gala night. - Gala night? I shouldn't think so, I wouldn't touch it. - Well, it's... It's too late now. I said you would. - You're joking. - No, I'm not. The Mayoress has put your name down. - Well, she can just rub it right out again. - But I promised. - I don't care what you promised. I have no intention whatsoever of Appearing in that little function. - Do you want to make me look a fool? - Would you really like me to answer that? - No. - No, I should think not. I can just hear you with the Mayoress. "Oh, yes, Mrs. Palmer. "Oh, no, Mrs. Palmer. "Oh, certainly, he'd be delighted "To do the gala night, Mrs. Palmer. "Oh, yeah, three bags full, Mrs. Palmer." You may inform anyone that's interested That Mr. Pinner declines the invitation. - It's all arranged. They'll be delivering the menus this afternoon. I've ordered the flowers and I've worked out the seating. Good afternoon. - (together) Good afternoon, Mrs. Palmer. - Oh, and I had another idea. I've got that Punch and Judy man to come along. - Punch and Judy man? - Yes, what's his name? Mr. um... - Not Pinner? - Yes. - Very well, gentlemen, we'll continue With our discussion in 15 minutes. - All right, Arthur. - All right, Mr Mayor. - (together) Good afternoon, Mrs. Palmer. - [Mayoress] Good afternoon. - What do you mean by bringing that wastrel into it? - Well, you told me to go ahead with the arrangements. I thought we ought to stick to the spirit of the occasion. - Spirit of the occasion? - That's what I said. After all, we are supposed to be Celebrating 60 years of Piltdown. - And this is your idea of a celebration? Pinner? He's just the type that's holding the town back and you encourage him? - I haven't encouraged anybody. I've simply arranged with his wife for him to come along. - Well, you can just go straight back And arrange for him to stay away. - I can't do that. You're not the only one with responsibilities, you know. - All right, all right. If it's done, it's done. But mark my words, they're just trouble that lot. Nothing but trouble. - Have you got a minute? - Oh, hello. Certainly, what is it? - Just a quick word, but it's important. - Oh, I see. Just a moment. I always have a cup of tea at this hour. Shall we go? - Yes. (dog barking) - Oh, er, come along in then. - Do you know I've never been in here before? - Mm? Good lord, nor you have. - Mm-hmm. I never knew your name was Charles. - Oh, yes, yes. After my uncle, on my mother's side. He was a master mariner. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, yes, yes. Would you like to sit? - Oh, that's fine. - Oh, good, good, good. Now I think you're gonna like this. It's the same blend that we used to have at home. Darjeeling with a trace of Soochong. - Very nice. Well, you're pretty well set up here. - Oh, yes, it's quite comfortable. Of course, it's not quite like a home, but... Well, it has its compensations. - You're very lucky. You want to hang on to it. Do you know what happened to me today? - No. - I went home to lunch and I was a little late, I'll admit that, but I was unavoidably detained. - Yeah. - Before I can open me mouth, I find that I Am put down for the Piltdown Gala. - Oh no. - Yeah. Delia fixed it behind me back. - Oh. - Got to get in with a nice class of people she says. No more of these dreadful theatricals. You've got to get on in the world. - Milk? - Yes, please. We've got to make something of ourselves. No more of this traipsing around. We've got to put down roots. - Sugar? - Two, please. I ask you, can you imagine me stuck Between Lady Jane Caterham and the Mayoress of Piltdown Bay? It's not funny. It's not my idea of a night out. Is it yours? - Good grief, no. - This is very good. Oh, you'll never get lumbered like this. You're on your own. - Yes. - [Wally] You don't know how lucky you are. - Well, that's a matter of opinion. It can be rather lonely. - Surely you don't get lonely. [ tell you this, I'd change places With you any day of the week. - Really? - You've got your freedom. - Oh, yes. - Nobody nagging you to make something of yourself. - Oh, no, certainly not. - You made a very wise decision to stay single. - Yes, well... Actually it wasn't my decision. The lady said no. - I see. - Well, it's probably all for the best. As I understand it, marriage is a matter of give and take. Not all of us are equipped for that sort of thing. Another cup? - No, thank you. What am I gonna do about this gala? After all, it is Delia's fault. Nobody can blame me if I turned it in. - Oh no, nobody's gonna blame you. - I can simply tell them I'm not gonna do it. I can tell Delia that I'm not going through with it. I could, couldn't I7? - Yes, you could. But you know I can't help feeling it's really a matter Of your own conscience, isn't it? - Conscience. Thanks very much for the tea. I'll give your regards to Delia. (fast-paced, cheery music) (Punch squeaking) - I say, you're going it a bit today. Steady on. Have you gone raving mad? What's the matter with you? It's the policeman now. - Put her back! (Punch squeaking) Put her back! (Punch laughing) - Well, I don't see what's so terrible about it. You appear before the public every day. - Not that public. - There's nothing wrong with them. - Oh, I know. They're a very nice class of people. - Well, so they are. You've never even spoken to them. You don't give anyone a chance. - I never give anybody a chance? You're fine one to talk. You fixed me up for this high class brawl tomorrow Without even consulting me? How do you know I didn't have another social engagement? - You? When did you ever have a social engagement? - I get around a bit. - The public bar of the Trident I suppose With all those other influential citizens. - No need to adopt that tone of voice. They're a lot better than the mob you like. Hmm. So much for the undercoat. - It wouldn't do any harm if some other people I knew Took an interest in their appearance. - How many pots of that stuff do you Manage to get through in a year? Let's see, there's one every two weeks and there's 52 weeks in the year At five bob a time. That's about six pounds two shillings Per annum you're spending on that stuff. That works out at about half a dollar A square inch I say. - You don't pay for it. - Hello. What's all this then? Etiquette For All. Common Courtesy For Everyday Use. Let's have a look at this then, where are we? Ah. "In writing to an Archbishop, a correspondent would begin "My Lord Archbishop, and end, I remain, My Lord Archbishop, "Your Grace's most obedient servant.” Now, that's very useful. I've been meaning to write to him for ages. - Ha ha. - Ah. Here's a valuable piece of information. "Women servants should wear muslin aprons, "White, in brackets, and collar, cap and cuffs. "They should be quick-sighted, deft-handed "and soft of foot." It's no good, Maud, you'll have to go. We can't have those great plates Banging round the furniture. - I should read on a bit if I were you. You might pick up a few useful tips. - Yeah, I think at the worst it's marvellous. Let's see now, what else have we got here? Oh, now, ah. What about this? "Cocktail parties depend for their success mainly "on the personality of the hostess." Darling, how absolutely divine of you to come. Do sit down, I must mix you a camel's leg. - At least it's not a Piltdown Glory. - Hm. The invisible man! - Do you really find it so funny? - No, it's not. - I do try, you know. You don't make it very easy for me. - What do you want me to do? - I want you to come tomorrow night. [t's not much to ask. It would mean a lot to me. - Oh, I don't know, I've seen some of these things. They're not all they're cracked up to be, you know. You might be disappointed. - I'll take a chance on that. It would make such a difference. You don't know what a difference it would make. - All right, I'll think about it. - It could make such a difference to us. - I've said I'll think about it. - You will come, won't you? - Go to sleep. - But you'll think about it. - I've said I'll think about it. Now could we get some sleep? (gentle instrumental music) (switch clicks) (Delia sighs) (cereal clatters) - Let me. (water splashes) (knife scratches) Tea all right, dear? - Yes. - It's a new kind. - Darjeeling with a touch of Soochong. - How did you know? -1 had some yesterday. - Oh, where? - Down at... Does it matter? - I only wondered. You will do it, won't you? - Yes, yes, all right then. I'll do it. - Oh, thank you. (lips smack) It'll be a wonderful evening, you'll see. - I hope so. (Wally sighs) I'll see you tonight then. - There we are. See you tonight! (bell rings) (dramatic instrumental music) - [Wally Voiceover] I must be stark raving mad! Yes, mad. I can't explain it. I wonder if I've got a temperature. I wouldn't be surprised. Gala night at Piltdown Bay! 60 years of sheer misery! Rain, rain, that might stop it. No. No, not a hope. No, not that lot. You... Fool, fool, fool, fool! And that didn't help either. (sighs) Oh, good day, Lady Mayoress. Yes, Mrs. Palmer. Of course, Mrs. Palmer. Good luck, Mrs. Palmer. Some tea? China, of course. How charming. How very delightful. (whimpers) Drop your litter in the bin. Otherwise it would be a sin. She looked very sweet as she walked down the street. And that's why darkies are born. - Good morning, sir. May I help you? - I want to buy a handkerchief. - Certainly, sir. What kind? - This one will do, that's fine. - Would you like me to... - No, no, that's all right, that's all right. - That one is one guinea. - Is it? One guinea. Thank you. - Thank you. - Il imagine this is fully insured? (lady sighs) (engine revving) (horn honks) (playful instrumental music) Why not one? What about a light Moselle? Slightly triangular. Or a little diagonal. Light and flowery. Or would you like a big red Burgundy? (grunts softly) Diagonal. Big red Burgundy. (tyres screech) (drums banging) (dog barking) It's all right for you! And he's only a dog. At the moment, I wouldn't mind being a dog. (Wally barks softly) Ah. Er. I seem to have lost me swazzle somewhere. Er. Yes. Er, probably left it in the hut. Somewhere about, I suppose. It was the best one, you know. The one I usually use. Um. Yes, probably left it in the hut. Incidentally, I'm doing the gala. - I'm sure Delia will be pleased. - Delighted. - Oh, these things have a way of turning out quite well. - Do they? - Hm? Oh, yes, quite well. - You wouldn't mind going yourself then? - I've not been invited. - Well, you have now. I shall be working, you can take Delia. Yep, yep, yep. - Black tie. - But, Wally. - Seven o'clock. - All right, if you insist. - Well, it's really a matter for one's own conscience, isn't it? (people cheering) (man whistles) (people cheer loudly) - Stop it, Wally, stop it! Oh, stop it! It's not for you, it's for Lady Jane. You do embarrass me. - My ticket. - All right. All right? - All right. - Take her in with that. - Good. - I'll see you later. - Why does he have to carry on like that? - My good man. Where is the artist's entrance, please? - Round the back. - That's a good start, isn't it? (chuckles) (smooth band music) - [Announcer] My Lord and Lady Plowright. - So glad you could come. - Thank you. - How do you do? - Meet my town clerk. - Good evening, my lord. - Good evening to you. - This way, please. - Mr. and Mrs. Walter Pinner. Mrs. Walter Pinner and Mr. Charles Alfred Ford. Mrs. Walter Pinner and Mr. Charles Arthur Ford. - Hello. Oh, I say. - Over there, please. - Delia. - Excuse me, I beg your pardon. But she's over there. - Yes, I know, I know. - I'm supposed to meet her. - Come on, I'm sure you will. - The Lady Mayoress said to me I'm definitely meeting her. She promised. - I do appreciate that. It's rather crowded here. Excuse me, so sorry. Try and get in. Would you mind just? Yes, now what would you like? - I don't know. - Well, a glass of sherry perhaps? - No, no, thank you. [, I think I'll have a gin, a large one! - What we all say is it's a grand place for the family. You know, a nice homely place for mum, dad and the kids. I don't know why folks bother flocking off to these foreign parts. Whatever they've got, Piltdown can provide. - Can't wait to see the casino. - The bowling green and the promenade And the garden of remembrance, very peaceful there. - Ah, they looking after you all right? - Yes, yes, splendidly. - Good. - Another glass of champagne? - Yes, that would be nice. - Waiter. I chose it myself, you know. Nothing but the best. - Where's the dressing room please? - Third floor. - Ah. (chuckles) Isn't that typical? We'll have to walk. - But I've got all this stuff. - Oh, stop complaining. It'll do you good, come on. Watch it, watch it now. Come on. That's it, that's it. (laughing) (people chattering) - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please. The time is nearly eight o'clock. In a few moments, His Worship, the Mayor, will proceed to the balcony to Introduce our guest of honour! (people cheer) - Lady Mayoress. - Over here. - Lady Mayoress! (crowd applauds) - Haven't you pawned your chain yet, Arthur? - He will tomorrow! (laughing) - My friends and fellow citizens, Tonight is the 60th anniversary or our fair town. And as your mayor, I consider it to be a great honour and privilege to welcome on your behalf our distinguished, and if I may say so, very lovely guest Of honour to join our festivities. (crowd applauds) In a few moments, I will ask her to throw the switch, which will light up the illuminations, a magnificent display especially designed by the head Of our carnival committee, Mr. Reginald Fletcher. (applauding) But before she does so, I will ask her to say a few words. Lady Jane Caterham. (crowd applauds) (crowd cheers) - Good evening. (crowd cheers) - When your mayor invited me to visit you In your famous old town, I was deeply honoured. (razor buzzes) All of us can Recall the happy days we spent as children, by the sea. And the sea, as we all know, is a deep part Of our island heritage. We are a nation of sailors. Salt water runs in our blood. Drake, Raleigh, and Nelson, these names which we cherish, They were the guardians of our sea-girt isle. And here in Piltdown, the tradition lingers, Still flourishes. - Hear, hear. (crowd applauds) - We of us who live in the great cities of this land seldom think of the hardships and the discomforts Which are the daily lot of you brave fisher folk. But true to the spirit of Merrie England, You well know how to make merry. (applauding) And it is in this spirit that I am happy To join with you here tonight. 60 years of Piltdown is indeed something to celebrate. May your next 60 years be as happy as the last. May the trade winds forever waft Gently over your golden beaches. And may your nets continue to bulge With the silver harvest of the sea. - Bravo. (crowd applauds) (crowd cheers) - And now I take great pleasure in switching On the Piltdown illuminations. (crowd applauds) (crowd cheers) Switch, switch. Switch. - Hand the lady the switch. (switch clicks) (crowd gasps) (majestic music) - Hooray, more, more, encore! Hup, hup! (razor buzzes) (man whistles) (man whistles) (fist knocking) - What's going on? - It was all right this afternoon. - Well, it's not all right now. It's sheer incompetence. I wouldn't trust you to mend a fuse. Can't you hear them laughing out there? It's your fault, do something about it. - I told you to stick to your fireworks, Arthur! - Very pretty. - Thanks. I think we might have a drink now. - Drink, yes. (people chattering) - Ah, Mrs. Peele, number 40. - Er, Lord Taylor, number eight, sir. - Number 14. - 147 - Number 14. - I believe we're number nine. - I'm sorry about this, Delia. - Oh, don't worry. - I expect there's been some mistake. - Yes, I know, but seated near this we can't see anything. - Hey, Wal. They didn't half make a mess of the illuminations. - Really? (chuckling) I'm not a bit surprised, it's typical Piltdown. - Yes. Don't forget to lay up that other place. - No, run on. - Here he is. - It's all right. Well, this is cosy, isn't it? How was Lady Jane then? Well, if you were with us you would know, wouldn't you? - Well, I had other things to do. - Wally. - Well. How was she? What did she say to you? - I wasn't introduced. - Why not? - Diverted, I believe. Not on the list. It's all right, it doesn't matter. - It matters for you. This is the main reason you wanted to come here. Well, that's it, we're off. - Don't make a scene. Sit down. - I wouldn't advise it. - Why not? - The chair's gone. - Gone? - Got your irons, Wal. - Oh, get us a chair, will you? - You'll get me the sack, you will. (gavel banging) - My lords, ladies and gentlemen. Please be upstanding to receive His Worship, The Mayor, And his charming guest of honour. (crowd applauds) - Oh. - Well, as we're staying, let's see what we're having. - It's lovely, look. - Le Delice de Sole Piltdown. A chat from the Mayor. And the Punch and Judy presented by W. Pinner. I'm looking forward to that. How do you set these things out? - Delia. - [Delia] No, no, not for me. Thank you. - No? (gavel banging) - My lords, Reverend sir, ladies and gentlemen, Pray silence for your chairman, His Worship, the Mayor. - You know what he is, don't you? (applauding) - My Lords, Reverend sir, ladies and gentlemen, I don't propose to detain you long. Now that we've wined and dined, very handsomely if I may say so, I think we should consider what has Made the evening such a success. The secret is good citizenship. And in Piltdown, that also means good fellowship. We meet here as friends, friendly rivals perhaps in the field of commerce, but certain allies In the fight for a greater Piltdown. 60 years is what we celebrate. 60 even more glorious years is what we anticipate. - [Audience] Hear, hear. - But we mustn't forget this is a gala occasion. So I'll ask you all to take the floor To the music of our own Percy Barlow and the Rebels. (applauding) And, if she'll oblige, I'll open the festivities With our delightful guest. - [Fletcher] Good old Arthur. (cheery band music) - Do you wanna dance? - Oh, yes, please. - I must say, I expected an older man. - We're very progressive here, you know. - You had a couple drinks tonight, didn't you? - No, why? - Yes, you did, I can tell. - Well, I was nervous. Does it show? - No, no, only to me. - Are you sure? - Yes, of course I'm sure, you're fine. What does it matter anyway? - Well, wouldn't like anyone 10 think I was... - Who cares about them, look at 'em. - I like a man who leads. - I wouldn't mind leading you. - Oh. - Sorry. - Look at you. Ah, you never could dance, could you? - Madam, have you never experienced the rare delight Of the Pinner left-hand down feather reverse turn? - I don't believe I've had that honour. - Then you're in, kid. - Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, you clumsy bloody fool! Why don't you look where you're going? You've ruined my stockings. - I'm terribly sorry. It was an accident. - Yes, well everything is an accident here. I wouldn't trust anyone in this ghastly town To do anything right. - [Wally] If you'd been looking where you were going... - This is entirely your fault. I hold you responsible. Charging about the floor with no consideration. - Ah, the voice of Piltdown! I'm terribly sorry to have to prise you apart In the middle of your civic duties. - Don't you dare talk to me like that! - Would you mind taking me away from this rabble? - Charming. - Oh, you insulted her, you insulted the Mayor! You, you ruined everything! (sobbing) - Mr. Drummer, please. (fast-paced drum banging) (cymbals banging) Ladies and gentlemen, it's cabaret time! (applauding) - It's all homegrown talent. They're really excellent, you know. - But here at Piltdown we like it a little different, As the bishop said, to the actress. (laughing) But seriously, ladies and gentlemen, And I would like to be serious, for a moment. We are here to celebrate 60 glorious years in the history of our own town, and I say our town, ladies and gentlemen, because after 15 years amongst you, I feel that I belong here. - Two more large brandies, please. - Hey, bring the bottle. - [Announcer] It's a happy time... - Very good, sir. - Ladies and gentlemen. And now just to show you how things used to be, We turn back the clock for the Punch and Judy Man. W. Pinner assisted by E. Cox. (applauding) (cheery band music) - Don't tell me you actually employ people like that here. - Here we go then. Into the valley of death. (light applauding) Evening, Percy. All right then. Let's get it over with. - That's a charming group. Hold it now, smile. Thank you. Here you go. Seven and six for three copies. Moments to cherish. Here we are, gents. Three copies for 15 shillings. Memories to cherish. Thank you. (paper ripping) Well, that's nice, isn't it? - Go away. - Oy, right oh! - Dobedobedobedo! Dobedobedobedo, here we are again! Hello! - Hello! - Hello. Goodbye. - Seriously? That's a short show. I want my money back. - Be quiet, George. - [George] Well! - My name is Joey the Clown and I'm very Squeezed to meet you.

(Punch squeaks) - Hello! - Judy! - [Judy] Yes? - Come up! - [Judy] Here I am. - Here's Judy. Give us a kiss! - [Judy] No. - I want a kiss. (laughing) - I'd go and claim your rights, old boy, if I were you. Faint heart and all that. (laughing) (Punch laughs) - Wait for it, here he comes. - No. - I want a kiss. - What's he doing? He's put his glass on the stage. - Has he, well, we'll soon deal with that. Good health. - Where's it gone? Someone's stolen my drink. - I'll do him in a minute. - No, let me. - [George] Take my drink. (crunching) Oh! (Punch squeaks) (stick banging) (laughing) - No idea how to behave. Where I come from we'd have thrown things at him. - Really? (belches) - What's this for? - Ammunition. (Punch laughs) - [Man] Oh, yes! (glasses clinging) (people chattering) - Well, that's nice, isn't it? (people chattering) (man laughing) - All right, that's it. I am leaving. - You can't! - Just watch me. - You can't leave like this. - I most certainly can. - Please, please, this is most unseemly. Most un-Christian! (plates crash) - What is going on? (guests laughing) (water squirting) That is the end. I wouldn't bother about a collection. Come on, we're off, and I hope she's satisfied. - One final volley. - He's still got my drink. - [Man] George, George. - Well, what about my committee? - I don't care about your committee. I don't care about Piltdown, and I don't care about you. Now get out of my way, please. - Hang on, what's this? Hang on. - Oh, really. Would you mind getting out of my way, please? - Nothing would delight me more, Madam, But at the moment it's a trifle inconvenient. - I really ought to go and help. - Oh good, Jolly D! (man clapping) - All right, all right. They don't need your encouragement. - Oh, what's it got to do with you, eh? Why don't you sit down? Oh! (fist smashing) (woman gasps) - Strong. - Memories to cherish. Ready tomorrow morning. - Nevil, Nevil do you think I could have three of those, please? - Of course. - Come on, Pinner, move yourself!

(tongue clicks) Pretty serious. - She was going for you. - Yeah, I can't help that. Brawling in public. It's like those dreadful theatricals. - But you said it was a good thing. - Yes, but. After all, I have a reputation to consider. - Reputation? - Well, yes. I mean, they'll never have me in after this. - Who won't? - Them. (laughing) - Oh. - Yes, still. I think you'd better start packing the begs. - Think so? - Mm-hm. - Do you mind very much? - Well, I mean, there's the shop and everything. - Do you want to stay here? - I don't think we can after that. - But do you want to? - No, not really. - No, no, no, no, no, no.
