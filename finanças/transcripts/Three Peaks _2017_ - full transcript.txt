Again? Okay. "Swimming robot." My turn now. Do it again. You said... - No! "I want to go back to the deep end." - No. I'll take my hand away. Now swim on your own. Very good! Don't paddle so much. Let's get all that water out! You know how much I love you? In French. Come to me! No, not you! Tristan! Good! Very good! I wonder why he doesn't speak French to me anymore. Maybe we should've moved to Paris after all. Really? Mr. Architect. Come here, Tristan! I need a witness. Really? Come on! Tristan, put your shoes on, please. What's that for? I don't know. What do you think? - No idea. What could it be? No idea. No. Beautiful, isn't it? Is that your phone, Tristan? When did you get a phone? Yeah, but it's not that easy. What isn't easy? We're thinking of moving to Paris. And Daddy? He can visit us. We'll talk it through with Daddy when we get back. Here we come! What did you wish for? - That's my secret. Has it got something to do with me? - Yes. But also with him. Wouldn't it be nice to have a little brother or sister? Come on. That's silly now. You don't need to cry. Why not? We've discussed this a thousand times. You have to accept the situation. It's not new, is it? I don't understand what your problem is. What do you want? All you do is work. - Just a few more days. And now... Left. Middle. Right. Middle. Left. Middle. And... middle. Right. Who's pumping? Me. - Exactly. Just one at a time, okay? Right. Middle. Left. Middle. Did a giant do that? What? - That. No, I think a cow is more likely. Is he sleeping now? - Who? The giant. Yes. That's what they say. - When will he wake up? I don't know. I heard him moving in his sleep. You're right. I heard it too. Are we going right to the top? - Yes. So here we are. My favorite mountain, Three Peaks. There are three mountains. Daddy, Mummy, child. Look: one, two, three. Maybe. Why is there snow on one side and not on the other? The sun rises over there and shines on that slope for most of the day. On the shady side, the snow doesn't melt so fast. Will my mountaineer buddy teach me how to swim in really deep water? Only if you promise to sleep in your own bed. I don't know if I'll manage. - Oh, you will. It's not that hard. What are you doing? - You have to point to where I am. Without looking. Tristan, where am I? Try again. Here! Exactly! Hello! I don't know. Where am I? Daddy? Yes? Don't push it up! See, our hands are the same size. - Exactly. Show me. Which line do you have? The other one. Any others? That one. It's here. - It is. And that one's like an arrow crossing through the middle of your hand. You see it? I don't have that one. How was it? Hang on, I'll help you. Tristan, where are you? Hello there. So, you... you can't eat our food just because you're all alone out there. Here's the deal: we'll allow you to stay with us. But on one condition: You don't touch our supplies. Okay? She promises to behave and not to touch our supplies. Tristan, go back to your bed... I'm afraid here. What's wrong? I stink. I know. So why do you do it? What? - Rub your nose in there. It's okay. Maybe I like it. You've never noticed it because you always go straight to sleep. Exactly. It shouldn't be allowed really. What? Falling asleep before me. Are you crazy? Sometimes people get a bit sad. Don't worry. No. No. You want some breakfast? Hot or cold chocolate? Hot chocolate. - Hot chocolate. Aaron? Everything's okay. Tristan wants you to read his story. Oh, really? What happened? I broke the saw. Oh, really? Great. What happened to him? - I "broke" him too. Great. And what happened to you? Why are you reading my story? Why? Mummy said you really wanted to. I have to practice. Otherwise I'll forget how to do it. That wouldn't be so bad. Night, mountaineer. What about my story? You didn't want one. - I did. Are you asleep? Mummy! Yes, darling? Mummy! Yes? Is that good? Close your eyes. What are you dreaming of? Of a monster. What's it doing? Chasing me. What can we do? Tell him. - Who? The giant. We could. Does he know? - What? That you're not my daddy. Maybe. If we hurry, we'll catch the sunrise. Aren't you scared? No. My shoes are so loose today... Do you know what happened? - No. Would you mind giving me my laces back? Why? I don't have them. It's hard to believe you sometimes. Why? - "Why?" Let's take the example of... ... the mouse trap. - Really? What happened? Good question. You should know. - I guess we both have no idea then. No idea. - No idea... And the saw? You're hurting me. - Oh, come on. I'm not. Put me down. - You're staying up there. I'm waiting here. Tristan! Tristan! Come out, Tris! Let's be friends again! We have to go back. Come on. We have to go! Aaron! Tristan! Aaron! Stay where you are! I'll come and find you! Tristan! Tristan! Can you hear me? You have to call out. I don't know where you are! Aaron! Here! Aaron! Yes! I'm coming! Tris! Aaron! Yes! You have to come here! Here! Where are you? Here! Stop that. Stop it! That's enough! How come you have all those muscles? I'm just bigger than you are. Mummy says that's why she likes you more than my daddy. Your nose is getting longer and longer. Why do you have more muscles than my daddy? Maybe he did less sport than me when he was little. He did kick-boxing. Are you sure? Because I did kick-boxing when I was young. Maybe he trained less than you. You can do so much stuff. It's not normal. - That's not true. Would you rather have a hat? A cowboy hat? Or a bow and arrow? Bow and arrow. - Bow and arrow? Then you also need a feather in your hair. Which animal would the feather come from? An eagle. And sometimes, if you were really quiet... you could hear two hearts beating next to each other. And then? The giant tried to rip out the other heart in his chest. But he only managed to grab a rib. Aaron? Do you promise to leave my mummy alone? Do you promise? Mummy! Tristan! Tris! Come here! Give me your hand! Tris! Do you promise? Mummy! Tristan! Tristan, I can see you! It's all good, my darling. Do you know where Aaron is? Do you know where Aaron is? - No. How's that possible? My darling... I love you from here... ... to the moon. All the way up there. They'll take you now, okay? But I'm right by your side. Unit 1 to HQ. We found the boy. We'll continue looking for the father. Aaron! Aaron! THREE PEAKS BABELFISCH TRANSLATIONS Rebekah Smith
