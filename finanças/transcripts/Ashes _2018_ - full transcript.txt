Uh, let's see. Well, a little about us. Okay, well, uh, my dad died about a year ago. And my husband Duane and our youngest daughter Melanie moved in with my mom to help her out. I don't need any help. I can take care of myself. - Mom, the doctor said you do. Doctors, what do they know? Nothing. - What do they know? Oh, you can't even drive. - Oh! You never should have taken away my car keys. What, Mom, you are a danger on the road. I am stuck here like a parakeet in a cage. - She's a danger on the road. A parakeet? - Just stop talking. Just, just stop. I can't hear you, Aunt Marion. Can you speak up? Yeah, I'm sorry to hear you're not feeling very well. - Ah. - Uh-huh. Ah, 60 days sober, baby. Uh, uh. - Mm-hmm. Oh, cake? That's how you doin' me right now? Yeah, baby. Oh, shit. I love you, girl. I'm so proud of you, Duane. - Oh, what. - Ellyn? Is that, is that... - Yeah, yeah. I'm still here, Aunt Marion. Ellyn, are you still even listening? Yeah. Ma, Ma. Aunt Marion is on the phone. - What does she want? - I don't know. Here, talk to her. Talk. Hello, Marion. How are you, sweetheart? - Miserable. I miss my brother. - Yes. - My husband is dead. - Yes, I know. How do you think I am? - I miss him, too. - You don't even give a damn. Aunt Marion is my dad's older sister. She was always a little weird. She still calls once in a while to say hi. She was the black sheep of the family. We're never really that close to her. Yeah. She never drove. Moved to Ohio, didn't have any kids. - Couldn't have kids. - Yeah. She was a public school teacher, yeah. Substitute teacher. I can't imagine her teaching anything. Uncle Don lived in Ohio, so she went to school there. - Uncle Don died like 20 years ago. My husband is dead. He was cremated. They sprinkled his ashes on his mother's grave, hmm. Yeah, we never really had a service for him or anything. We actually never went to Ohio. Not that I wanted to go to Ohio. Oh, me and your dad, we went there once. We stayed in the guestroom. It was so depressing. Hello. Yup, this is Ellyn. Ma, Aunt Marion died. Aw. Who's on the phone? - Her friend Gail. Why is she calling you? I'm getting Aunt Marion's ashes sent to me. You're her next to kin. That's what they do. - I know. Doesn't matter if you want 'em or not. - I don't want 'em, though. - You got to take them. - I don't want her ashes. - You're her blood. We used to laugh at Aunt Marion. I'm not saying it was right, but she made it hard not to. For example, when I was in the 10th grade, I had a hernia operation. I called her in and asked her to turn the TV to Channel Two. She walked in and turned the channel, and then she walked out. I called her back in and said, Aunt Marion, can you turn the TV on? It was off. I mean, she would just change the channel. - It's so funny. - And who does that? Remember when she used to pat us on the head like a dog? - Ugh, I hated that. It drove me crazy. Maybe I drove her a little crazy, too. Hello? Hello? That was Gate Night. Oh, how Aunt Marion hated Gate Night. Around here, Gate Night is the night before Halloween when evil tricks are to be played. Mm-hmm, she used to say that Gate Night was gonna to be the death of her. I don't really remember her that much. I was a kid when she stopped visiting. I don't remember her at all. But, you know, I think it's really mean that you guys used to laugh at her. - No, she didn't even care - She didn't know. - if we were doing it. - We were kids. We didn't know any better. Yeah, maybe never said it. No, it's not like she didn't scare us. Aunt Marion? - Huh? - She's doing it again. Oh, so? She's in my room, please. See, I told you. Aunt Marion? It was hurting me. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I can't believe she died on that weird night that she said would be the death of her. Gate Night, and it's totally weird. Yeah. I've never seen anybody's ashes before. Oh, yeah, me neither. Let's look at this. Ugh, oh. - Oh, god. Looks like cement or rocks or you know that candy? - Really, candy? - Yeah. More than ashes. They're creeping me out. Where are you gonna keep her? Pfft, I don't know. I don't wanna see it. Mom, she's not an it. She's your aunt. Fine, fine, I will find a place for her somewhere. Where? Ma! You cannot keep her in the linen closet. Why not? She's near our sheets. So? Can you please find somewhere else? Fine, just leave it on the dresser for now. She's not an it. Oh, my god. What is wrong with you? Damn it. Hey, baby, have you seen my, what are you doing with that? We're getting married. What do you think? I'm looking for a place to put it. Oh, well, put it wherever you want. Just keep it off my man cave. This is my man cave, you know. I work in here. I work out in here. I give me some me time, you know what I mean? And, personally, I have no problem with Aunt Marion. I mean, she was a little wack. And I know she's Bob's sister, and Bob's my father-in-law, and I love him, but I can't work out with her like right there. You won't even see her. But, babe, I told you this is my man cave. Baby, it's our garage. But it's all I got. It's all I got. Babe, you're still thinking about it? Ashes don't belong in the closet. You were right to say something. I know. I know that, I know. But it's just, I don't know why it's bothering me so much. 'Cause you thought you were okay with your Aunt Marion being here, and maybe you're not. That's okay. You wanna know what's scary? What's scary? Oh, you know me. Of course, I know you, babe. So where did your mom end up putting them? Ellyn! Daddy? Daddy? Daddy? Daddy? I don't know what you. I don't know what you just, oh. Oh, why, Daddy? Why? I don't know. I don't know. Babe, what are you doing? What, she's not gonna believe me if I tell her she was talking in her sleep. I don't know. Daddy? Daddy? Daddy? Daddy? Hey, hey, hey. Wake up! Oh, fuck. Oh, my god. You okay? I was dreaming about my dad. You woke me before he told me. Well, I thought you were gonna die by the way you're breathing. What are you talking about? Ah, Daddy, ah, ah, ah, ah! You were like that. But, god, I was scared. Well, what are you dreaming about? He had a message for me. I have dreams. I believe with all my heart that they're messages. Loved ones from the other side trying to tell me something. I saw my grandfather a few times. He wanted to let me know he was watching over me and that I would be okay. I had cancer and I'm okay. Yeah, it was a rough period when... Yeah, and then I saw my Nanny once, yeah. That's my grandma. We called her Nanny. She told me to look out for her little girl, my mom, and I do my best. The dream. Oh, yeah, the dream, sorry. My dad said to get rid of the ashes, and I don't know why because someone woke me before he told me why. - I saved her life, basically. - Whatever. My dreams are the truth. We need to get rid of her. How? Can we just throw her out? No! That's the weirdest thing you've ever said. I say we just call the cemetery and ask them, can we bury her ashes with your dad. I mean, I had a friend of mine who buried his mom's ashes with her dad just to save some money. No, no, no, no, no. Your father would not like that. No, no, no. You don't know what Dad would do. - I know, of course I know. - No, you don't know. It says here that you can turn her into a diamond. Oh, wow, a diamond, that's something. It costs three grand. - Ugh. - Yeah, no, and I wouldn't wear a dead body. Shit, and we ain't got three grand for that. Okay, guys, none of this matters because that's not what Aunt Marion wanted. Honey, we don't know what she wanted. Mom, she was cremated and you're her next of kin. She knew she was gonna end up with you. That's what she wanted. Yeah, but I had a dream. I had a dream. Okay, Ma, sure you did. What, you're the only one who can have dreams? - Yeah, no, I'm sorry. - I had a dream. Mom, sorry, please tell me what your dream is about. I dreamed about Marion and she was mad. Mad about what? I don't know she didn't say. Then how do you know she was mad? Because she looked mad. I know mad when I see it. - Oh, Grandma. Grandma, you're projecting. - No. No, you think she's mad so you had a dream that she's mad. Dream or no dream, I don't want her ashes in the house. Yeah, no, and I don't, either. So maybe we can find a place that will hold them and take care of them. That place is here because she's still family. You guys know that, right? That costs money. What costs money? Those places where you store them, they cost money. Shit, we ain't doing that. Why don't we just bury them in the backyard? - No. - No, Camille. Yuck. My father said to get rid of them. Mom, it was only a dream. Only a dream. You know, listen, haven't any of you had anything happen to you that you couldn't explain but you knew it meant something? Oh, yeah. After Grandpa died, I was pretty upset about Nanny having to be alone without him. But I'll never forget it. After Nanny died, I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw him standing there. Oh. In my bedroom, smiling at me, holding hands. I mean, it lasted for a moment and then it faded away. Okay, see, so then you believe. No, Ellyn. I was half awake. I saw exactly what I wanted to see. - Oh, my god. - What kind of stupid story. Guys. Look, if they bother you that much, I could take her back to L.A. with me and dump her ashes in the ocean. Uncle Jay, that's not right. No, no, no, yeah, Aunt Marion loved the ocean. Well, I love the foot spa, Mom, but I don't want you to dump my ashes in there. What about the attic? - That's a great idea. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. - It's still in the house. Hall monitor? I mean, it's not very respectful but it's in the house. So I suppose it's okay. Yeah, I don't know. Babe, you'll forget she's even there in no time. - Yeah. - But that's the point. She's still here and that goes against what my father said. Ellyn, Dad didn't say anything. He's dead. Ma, I think we should at least try keeping her here. Yeah, she's got to go somewhere, and you've gone through every closet. - True. - Oh, yeah. Look, just trust us on this one. Give it a week. If anything bad happens, you get rid of her then. So all in favor of the attic? Yeah. You're gonna regret this. Done. Be careful putting her up there. Wait. Wait, what? Come on, babe. She's your aunt. You raised your hand. Hey, you're the man of the house, right? Eh. Is there a place to put it up there? Yeah. I got it right here. I'm done. - Yeah, okay. Baby, maybe tomorrow when everyone's out of the house, you can go bury them somewhere. No, everyone's gonna think they're still up in the attic. It's not like they're gonna wanna see them. Baby, it's a good, baby, come on. Shit. It's alive, it's alive. It's alive. Duane. Duane, Duane! What, what? Baby, I heard something in the attic. Marion? Marion. Oh. Grandma? Oh, my god, Mom, hurry! - What happened? - Grandma is having a stroke or something. - Oh, my god. Oh, my god, go get help. Momma. Mom, I'm here. I'm here, Momma, I'm here. It's okay, it's okay. My mom had a stroke after a nightmare about Aunt Marion. Grandma is 86 years old and she has a lot of health issues that I'm pressing for... - You don't think the timing is just a little too coincidental? Well, no, because, you know, things can happen when you least expect them. And you can't go around placing meaning on everything, Mom. Her box of ashes fell off the shelf in the attic. Explain that. Maybe it was rats. It could be rats, you know. We don't have no goddamn rats in, Mel. There could be rats now, You do not believe we have rats. because rats only happen until rats, right? I mean... - No, we don't have rats, Mel. Oh, anybody wanna get out on this? Mm, yeah, babe. Thank you. What's wrong, Camille? Nothing. Camille? I'm moving in with Ty. - What? - What? Tonight. - What? - Excuse me? Mel? Mel! Did you know about this? I'm pregnant. What the hell? Eric is unemployed. - He'll find a job. - No, no, no. And you barely get by working in a strip club six days a week. He'll get a job. I'm not talking about this. - He will get a job? - I am a grown woman. - It costs money. I have a job, I have my own apartment. Can you please just be happy for me? Mm-mm, mm-mm. Sorry, I'm sorry. Of course I'm happy for you. Dad? You're happy for me, too, right? Yeah, yeah, of course I am happy for you. And we'll be here to help, whatever you need. - Yeah. - Yeah. Will you pass the sprout? Thank you. So you're really doing this. Yeah. Honey, don't you think you're moving a little to fast? You married Dad after knowing him for a month. It's about Aunt Marion, isn't it? I don't know. Maybe. I mean, I've been trying really hard not to freak out about Aunt Marion because she's family. You always just tell us family came first. But if I'm being honest, Grandma's stroke scared me. Yeah, I know. See, I know you. I mean, I still don't know if Aunt Marion has anything to do with this or not, but it just got me thinking, like, it's time I move out on my own. Like, I can do this. I can live out on my own. You're right. You're right, I know you're right. It's just really hard letting you kids go. Your sister's pregnant. I know. Why am I the last to know? Well, I was at her place. She was throwing up, so I figured it out. This is mine. It was. So you're gonna come visit? Mom, I'm gonna be five minutes away. Stop worrying. Come here. I can't help but worry. You wanna take your Aunt Marion with you? - Not funny. - Okay, little funny. I'll help you here. - No, I'm good. - Okay. I wanna be happy for Melanie, but I can't let go of my dream. Something about Melanie moving out doesn't feel right, and I know it's because of the ashes. Ma, you have any tomatoes? I've been craving them like crazy. Ma. Mom, you've been sitting in front of Aunt Marion for over an hour. I didn't realize it was that long. You really wanna get rid of her, don't you? Yes, yes. Oh, god. Am I being crazy about this? Look, some weird stuff has happened since the ashes arrived but that does not mean that those things wouldn't have happened if they weren't here. Your sister would still be living here. Mel is 23 years old. It's time she moved out. It's a good thing she has a boyfriend even if it's Ty. Hey, babe. Come over here. Come watch this with me. I don't really like those kind of movies. They give me nightmares. You gotta be kidding me. It's so fake and it's mad old. Well, it doesn't matter. It freaks me out and I can't unsee those things. Whatever, okay? You posted about my guns? Oh, yeah. Um, all I said was, new home, #boyfriendwithguns. And that's posting my business to all your friends, you know that. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know it was a secret. You didn't know it was a secret. I'm sorry you didn't know it was a secret. You want me posting about you? - Why, well, I'm sorry. You want me posting naked pictures of you in the fucking shower and shit? I said I'm sorry. Why the fuck do you get off posting about my business? I didn't know it was a big deal. It's nobody's fucking business. That's the big deal. Okay. You have licenses for them, right? Ty. Listen, don't worry about my fucking business, bitch, okay? Hey, don't call me that. Get off me. Ah. You fucking, get off me. Are you afraid of this? You afraid of me? You really think that I would shoot you? Ty, Ty please put it away. I'll take down the post. Please stop. I'm gonna take down the post, please. Fuck! Hey, if you don't like it, you can get the fuck out of here. You can live with those fucked up ashes. You hear me? You okay, Ma? What's wrong? I'm worried about your sister. - Babe, she'll be fine. - I know, honey. She's only been gone for like one day. Listen, I know you think I'm crazy with all this Aunt Marion stuff. - Come on, babe. - But you know what? I have a bad feeling about this. Babe, you gotta stop. No. You're gonna start manifesting shit. Right. What, what is it? It's Mel. Where's my daughter? Where's my daughter, motherfucker? - Dad. - Where is she? Dad he has guns. He held one in my head. You're not the only one with guns, motherfucker. The only difference is I will use one, you got me? I got you. It's okay. You okay? Where are the guns? In the bottom drawer. For fuck's sake. Put this in your bag. Apologize. Apologize to my daughter. I'm sorry, babe. Oh, fuck. Don't call my daughter babe, motherfucker. Fuck you. Fuck. So I called the cops. I gave them the guns. They went to Ty's apartment but he was gone. Well, he better not ever show his face around here ever again, ever. I mean, I never saw him like that. It was like I didn't even know him. Mom, blames Aunt Marion, of course. Well, whatever it was, I ain't playing no more games. Anybody wanna take my daughter out, come near her, they gotta get the interview process, man. I'm background checking the fuck out any one of you loose-lip motherfuckers coming close to my daughter. This here is shut down, chastity belt, locked up tight. Oh, god. So? I want them out of the house. Look, I know that Ty ended up being an asshole, but it feels wrong to be blaming Aunt Marion for what happened. - Are you serious? - What? You don't feel any connection? Nothing? All of a sudden Mr. Perfect is Mr. Creepozoid? Maybe a little, but if you believe in black magic at all, then maybe we should keep her. Getting rid of her is gonna make her mad or something. Mad? We've been keeping her this long and look what's happening. Yeah. Now, I can take her to the cemetery tomorrow and see how much it costs to bury her with your grandfather. But what about Grandma? She said Grandpa wouldn't like that. Well, when she gets home from the hospital, we'll just tell her Aunt Marion is up in the attic and that will be that. - Ma, come on. - What? Listen, your grandfather loved his sister, okay? Crazy as she was. And he told me to get rid of the ashes. So I know he'd be okay with this, I know it. Well, what if it costs three grand or five grand? Honey, I don't know. What's the matter, Camille? - Camille? I lost the baby. My first was a miscarriage. Mom, I know you're trying to help, but can I just be sad - You might not be here - for just a little while? - if this one had lived. - Is that much too ask? - You don't know. I mean, let's leave these things in God's hands. I cried for days. And then the next time I was pregnant, I was so scared. Every day, I was wondering if you were okay inside of me. Of course, back then, we know it's medical. - Mom. - What? Can you please just not blame Aunt Marion's ashes for this? - She couldn't have children. - Not for this. - She couldn't have children. That's what I'm saying. - That doesn't mean anything. I just really wanted to be a mom. Honey, honey, you will be. You will be, you'll see. You're gonna be a great mom. You're gonna be a great mom. I'm getting rid of her tomorrow. Are you sure you girls don't want come to the cemetery? - So sure. - Not happening. Hey, but what if they don't take the ashes from you today? Oh, your uncle wired the money. They'll do it. I have a feeling I will be the one burying these damn ashes. Honey, you know I haven't seen my dad's grave yet. And you're not gonna start today. I know, you said it like 100 times. Let's go. Aunt Marion, we hope this makes you happy. Great, all right, let's go. Oh, shit. - I didn't do that. - Why would you do that? Holy shit. - Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit, oh, shit. No. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This is bad. - Oh, shit. - We're sorry. - Camille, oh, my god. - We're sorry. - I can't open my eyes. This is so bad. - Mom? - Babe? Oh, my god, is she okay? - Mom? - Babe. Hey. Mom, are you okay? Oh, shit. Oh, god. - Oh, oh, oh, oh. - Oh, no. Oh, what the fuck? Oh, my, oh! - Oh, my god, Mom, no. Oh, my god, that's disgusting. Oh, my god. Ah! You okay? Hi. Holy hell. I know. I'm fine, I'm fine. - Oh, my god, Mom. - She slipped in the salon. In 15 years, I've never slipped in that salon before. Mom, it was a wet spot. Babe, in 15 years, I'm telling you. Come on, just cut it out. I'm just saying. Did she at least go to the hospital? Oh, come on. - Oh, yeah. Help me, please. I went to urgent care. They took x-rays. They said that's all they could do. Yeah, I made a doctor's appointment for Monday, so. 15 years, not one slip. Oh, god. It was a wet spot, okay? A wet spot. When I was lying there on the ground, all I could think of was Aunt Marion, and I kept asking myself, did I deserve this? You know? Did I deserve this? Hey, Mom. I wanted to show you this. Mom. Mom, are you okay? Dad. Dad, Dad, come here. - What? Oh, shit. See? Should we wake her? Okay, look, um, being careful not to wake the sleepwalker, gently turn him or her in the direction of their bed and walk near the person until he or she gets back into bed. If returning a sleepwalker safely back to bed doesn't work, use a loud noise to wake up the person. - Marion. - Oh, shit. Dad, make a loud noise. Marion. Do it. Babe? Ma, are you okay? I'm fine. Go to bed. Okay. I think she's good. Yeah, she's good. Go to bed. I don't remember anything. Baby, my hair. I can't believe I did this. I don't know. I kinda like it. I kinda like it. Dick. That's our cutting board. It's a spirit board now. What are doing with it? I'm gonna talk to your Aunt Marion, find out what she wants. And you think that's gonna work? It's worth the shot. You wanna do it with me? No. Mom, I'd be afraid to mess with that. Why? We'll either hear from Aunt Marion or we won't. Mm, maybe we should hire a professional medium. To charge me an arm and a leg? No, thank you. I can do it myself. Besides, your dad, he doesn't like strangers in the house knowing our business. Do you even know how to use it? What's to know? You put your hands on the planchette, you talk. I've seen it in the movies. First off, this is an egg slicer. Hey, guys. Hey, babe. - Hey, babe, hey. What's that for? What do you think? I'm looking at directions online. Oh, good. Every time I come home, there's something new with this. Never insult a spirit. Ha-ha, you're screwed. Never play alone. - What else does it say? - A lot. It says never use the board if you are sick, drunk, depressed, or mentally disabled. - Eh. - Not a word. Do not force anyone to use the spirit board against their will. So just to be clear, do not ask me to do this with you, huh? Okay. Never trust the spirit. Evil spirits will use lies and false flattery to gain your confidence and trick you. So how do I know if Aunt Marion is telling the truth? How do you even know it's Aunt Marion at all? I'll find out. Okay, go ahead. Don't ask about God or when you're gonna die. If you encounter a spirit called Zozo, stop playing. Who's a Zozo. I don't know but if we encounter him, we'll stop. Okay, never let the planchette fall or fly off the board. It could allow an evil spirit to escape. Hold on, if this things flies up the board, we're moving. Moving. - Dad, Dad. When you're finished, always say goodbye. I mean, that's pretty much it. The rest is about getting rid of the board. Save that part. We'll need that later. - Yeah. - Okay. So? - Let's do this. - Let's do it. Okay. Aunt Marion. Now what? Ask a question, Mom. Aunt Marion, are you here? Aunt Marion, please answer me. Are you here? Oh. Did one of you just move that? - No. - No, I swear. Ha-ha? She's laughing. You don't even know it's her yet. Aunt Marion, this is Melanie. Is this you? One of you had to move that. - I swear to god. - Dad, it moved. Aunt Marion, this is Duane. Are you mad at us? Okay, so, she's not mad. Aunt Marion, are you mad at my mom? See, I was right. I told you guys. God, ugh. Aunt Marion, is there anything I can do to make you feel better? Anything. Oh, shit. Babe. Oh, my god, Mom. - Get your hands off. - I can't, I can't. - Stop, Mom. - Get your hands off. Oh, my god. Oh, my god! Help me! Mom, stop, stop! Stop pulling your nails, fuck! Mom, no, Mom, no! Mom, no, stop! Oh, my god. My nails. Jesus, my nails. Look at my. Oh, my god, Duane, did I do that to you? No, no, no, it was Aunt Marion. Marion or not Marion, we are done with this board. - Yeah. - No, we have to say goodbye. - No, fuck that, no! - What? Are you crazy? - No, we're not doing that. We have to. Don't do this. - Duane. Duane, please. Okay, okay. Goodbye, spirit. Goodbye and good riddance whoever you are. Goodbye, Aunt Marion. Okay, do not burn the board. There have been cases where people burned the board and it released an evil spirit. Oh, god, my nails. They're nails, babe. They'll grow back. To properly dispose of a spirit board, you need to pour holy water on it and then bury it. I will. I'll go to the church tomorrow and I'll pick some up. Baby, you haven't been to church in years. I never really had a reason to go. - Wait. - God, Duane, I'm so sorry. Oh, my god. Where is the planchette? It's in the dining room on the board, why? Do not leave the planchette on the board when you're not using it. This could allow evil spirits to enter the world. Why is it saying that right now? No, no, no, I'm sorry, Ma. - That's ridiculous. - Guys. I can't believe. - Guys, hey! It should be the first thing. - Hey! - Not the last. Before anybody panics, let's just go check. Shit. Now, what? Hang on. Okay, okay, okay. It says we can start a new session and ask the demon to leave. Mm-mm, nope, nope, nope, nope. We are done with this board tonight. It was only on the board for like 20 minutes. It's an egg slicer, and that's the internet, and it could be complete bullshit what you're reading, okay? We're done. Let's just go to bed. We'll get rid of it in the morning. Okay, I'm for that. Okay. - Yeah. Baby, will you sleep with me tonight? - Oh, I was planning on it. - Okay. Wait. Why don't you guys sleep together every night? Well, we do when we wanna... - No. - Yeah. I'm good. Aunt Marion, are you here? Aunt Marion, please, I wanna talk to you. Are you here? Did you make Ty turn on Melanie? Did you make Camille have a miscarriage? My mom and me falling at the salon? Was that you? Are you mad at us because we laughed at you? That was stupid and thoughtless of us. We didn't mean to hurt you. Will you forgive us, please? Thank you, Aunt Marion. Thank you. Are you with my father? If you see him, can you tell him that I miss him? You. Ha, yeah, me, okay. Yeah, I've got the board, right. Okay, I'll do it. Hey, Aunt Marion, will you still be watching over us here? Goodbye. Daddy? I tried for 20 minutes to contact my dad. Didn't get any answer. I can't believe you used the spirit board alone. It's like I couldn't help myself. Do not become addicted. Evil spirits may try to make you dependent on the board in order to gain control of you. Hmm. We have to get rid of it. Okay, remember to bury the board and the planchette separately. Okay. What else? Sprinkle the ground above with holy water and also use some to cleanse the area where you used the board. Oh, my god. Is this blood? Okay. Let's do this. He buried it. We did everything according to ritual. Aunt Marion forgave us, and I don't feel afraid anymore. Oh, and my mom is back. It's a good day. It's a really good day. 67 across, danger signal perhaps, four letters. Horseshittin'. I said four letters, Ma. You didn't say that. I did. You weren't listening to me. I'm thirsty. Okay, I'm gonna get you some water. Omen. - Hello. - Whoa. I'm looking for Ellyn. Um, I'm Ellyn. I'm Gail. Gail was my Aunt Marion's special friend. Oh, it's her only friend. Believe me. So, we're not sure what she's doing here, but we are gonna make her feel at home. Nobody knows what she's doing here. Yeah. Make her feel at home, Mom. No, you make her feel at home. I'm home. Your bandages, what happened? - Oh, um, burn them cooking. - Nail fungus. Um, so what brings you here, Gail? I have been in Ohio my whole life. Now that Marion's gone, I thought I would travel a little. So, I took the train and here I am. Hmm. Um, in my aunt's obituary, it said you were her very special friend. Hmm. After your Uncle Don passed, Marion went a little, um, you know. So I moved in and took care of her. So, where are you staying? Oh, I don't know yet. I was hoping you could suggest a hotel. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, you don't need a hotel. You can stay, you stay here with us, right, yeah. Oh, I couldn't impose. Um, give us just one minute. Certainly. What, what, what, what? Why did you say she could stay here? I can't just send her to a hotel. Why not? That's what she asked for. So you just show up? You can't pick up the phone? She was my special friend. You mean Aunt Marion's special friend. That's what I said. No, you said your special friend, and that's creepy. Special friend makes it sound like they're lesbians. - Hey, hey, hey. - And that's sort of weird. No, no, no, no. Hey, none of this matters 'cause you already asked her and you can't uninvite her. Why don't we just tell her all we have is a lumpy couch? Ah, great idea. - Oh, baby, you're so smart. - Do it, do it, do it. Let's go, let's go, let's go. And this is us on the bus to Columbus. Oh. She used to send us post cards from Columbus. She went there a lot. We both did together. They had our favorite bookstore. Oh, which one was that? It was a black magic bookstore. Your Aunt Marion was fascinated with the afterlife. Hmm. Oh, she's wearing a neck brace in this one. Yes, I know. Shortly before she died, she fell out of a chair, poor thing. Oh. She looks so lifeless. Well, she should. She's dead. Oh, my god. I know. I took a picture. Call me crazy. Have you ever seen a dead body? When we found my dad dead in his favorite chair, I took a picture. Yeah, I texted it to Jay, but he just thought it was weird and deleted it. I still have it. I won't go to his grave, but I'll keep a dead picture of him. Crazy, right? She looks... - Mad. - Yeah. - Yes, I know. Marion had a lot of anger and it only got worse with the years. Towards the end, she was unbearable. But I loved her as I'm sure you did, too. Hmm. Hello? Momma. She laughed at me. Dad, hurry! - What the? - Am I funny now? Mom! - What are you doing? - Mom, no! - Stop, stop! - No! No, stop! Ellyn! Help me. Help me. Help me! - What? - The hell was that? - Gail. - Gail? - Gail. - Gail. Gail, Gail, Gail, Gail. - What is she doing? What is she doing? What is she doing? Mom! Mom! Gail, Gail! Duane, break it down. Oh, no. Oh, my, no! Oh, my god, Gail. What did she do? Gail came here with a purpose. And she killed herself trying to accomplish something. But what? God, I wish I knew. I wish I knew. Fuck. Hey, Mom, you okay? No! No, I'm not okay. I can't fucking see. I can't open this goddamn pills. And look at my hair! Fucking look at my hair. It's okay, it's okay. Jesus Christ! All right. See? Back to normal. At least my hair color is. Mom, we're gonna figure this out. Let me grab a towel, I'll be right back. Okay. What's happening to me? I know now that laughing at Aunt Marion all those years was wrong. I'm not proud of my behavior, but, fuck, I thought she forgave me. Maybe that wasn't her, I don't know. All I can say is Duane, thank god for Duane. He's been my rock through all of this. Ellyn. What the fuck? Ellyn, it's Duane. Let me go. - Mom! What's happening? Dad? Mom? What? Oh, my god, Duane. - Get away from me. Don't touch me. Okay, no. Look, man, uh, I can't stay here. I gotta go. Aunt Marion wants me dead. If I stay, I'ma die, you know? You understand that? You see what she did? Look at this shit. I gotta go, man. Don't fucking judge me either. You don't know what it's like. I said don't fucking judge me. I didn't do this shit. Fuck this, man. I gotta go, I'm not doing this. Here you go, Grandma. Not the best cook, but I hope you like it. What can you do to a grilled cheese sandwich, huh? You know, figured it was a safe bet. Mm. Are you all moved in? Uh, yeah. Well, it's so nice having you around, sweetheart. Well, it's only until Mom feels better. Hmm. I figured, uh, Mel could use a little help around here. Aw, you're such a good daughter. Aw. You're both good girls. Thanks, Grandma. Yeah, we gotta do something about your mother. She's crazy. Well, I think we have a solution. We're getting a paranormal expert. For the record, I'm against all of it, okay? Because there are scam artists out there, scam artists, and I don't trust any of them. For the record, our mom is possessed. So we don't have a choice. We're getting a paranormal expert. What about these guys? Chip and Ronnie, they're brothers. They claim to be the real deal, I mean, and they're cheap. Well, they're cute. One of them is blind. Oh, my god, he'd be great for you. Why are you so mean? You love me. Let's watch the video. Hi, that's my brother, Ronnie. And that's my brother, Chip. And we're the Polter-Guys. We're paranormal investigators you can trust. Are you afraid to go to sleep? Is someone in your family possessed. Call us and we'll give you a free consultation. You got nothing left to lose. Except evil spirits. Whooo-ooo-ooo. - Really, these dorks? - Ma. I mean, they're total strangers. Mom, please. Dad's gone. We're scared. - And look at you. Yeah, well, can't we just think of something else? What? I don't know. - Hospital? - No. - Mental ward? - No, no. I don't want that. That's not gonna work anyway. I think we can all agree that this is about Aunt Marion. We need to try these guys. Yeah. I'm afraid to mess with the spirits again. Yeah, well, we are, too. But we have to do something for your sake. Where are the ashes? The vacuum. We had a little accident. That's not good. Is it just you three? Well, our Uncle Jay, but he's in L.A. And our dad, sort of. Where is he? He left. We haven't heard from him since. He was a recovered drug addict. Yeah, we think he relapsed. His phone is not working. That royally sucks, I'm sorry. This is her, your Aunt Marion? Yes. Why would she be mad at you? What makes you think she's mad? She's tormenting your family, and my guess is you've looked better. Well, when me and my brother were young, we found humor in Aunt Marion. You know, she was, she was a bit of a nut job. Found humor, you mean you laughed at her. Yeah, but I apologized. I contacted her with a spirit board. Didn't work, did it? No. Why not? You apologized to get yourself off the hook, not because you felt bad for what you did. So, big difference. Can you help us? We can't promise, but we think so. Listen, guys, I don't wanna sound skeptical here, but how do I know you're qualified for this? Mom. What, I'm just asking. Fair enough. We used to be in a local rock band. We were playing in a club one night, and on the way home a drunk driver hit us. The driver was killed and we were pretty banged up. Ronnie went to a coma and they say I died on the table, but 47 seconds later, I'm back. Still in darkness, though. And I came to in the middle of the night. I heard a voice. It was the driver saying he was sorry. I was in the bed next to Ronnie. I woke up and I could see the guy just covered in blood from the accident. - You're blind and you can... - See the spirits. Can't hear 'em, though. Makes for some pretty fucked up nights. I can hear 'em. Never once saw them. Ironic, but in the spirit world, Chip is my eyes. So we decided to try and use this gift to try and help people. Look, we don't have an agenda here, Ellyn, except to help you. And from the looks of things, you need help. Why do they have to hypnotize me? Because you've had contact with Aunt Marion, Mom. For some reason, she wants to make herself known to you. I had a stroke. We know. That may actually help. Your brain's been altered. It might make an easier portal for the spirit. But we can't hypnotize someone who doesn't wanna do it, so we need you to be okay with it. Is that the only way you can contact her? We found hypnosis to be the best way to summon spirits to us. - Yeah. Can anything bad happen? There's some risk for us, too. Please, Ma. What do I have to do? All right, Caroline. I want you to close your eyes, clear your mind, and listen to the sound of the metronome. Can you do that for me, Caroline? I'll try. Focus on your breathing, slow, deep breaths. Clear your thoughts. Let yourself relax. Feel yourself sinking deeper into your chair. Can you hear me, Caroline? Yes. I want you to see yourself outside Aunt Marion's house. Now, as you make your way to the front door, I want you to feel more relaxed with each step. Make your way to the front door, Caroline. Are you there now? Yes. The door opens. Walk through the door. Once you're through, ask Marion to join you. Marion. She's here. - What, Mom. - Grandma. Ma. Ma. Marion is saying she deserves this. Did your mom love your Aunt Marion? I don't know. I don't, I don't think so. Did she laugh at her? Yes, she laughed a lot with her sister, our other aunt, our favorite aunt. She's strangling her. Marion, I want you to return to the other world. You don't belong here. What they did was wrong, but people make mistakes. And this is your brother's family. She's saying he deserved better. No! No, no! She's gone. Aunt Marion, no! Aunt Marion, no! God, stop. Mom. Grandma died. We found an envelope marked last wishes, and she wanted to be buried with our grandpa. That's why she didn't want me to bury Aunt Marion there. I hope Grandma can help us now that she's watching over us. Chip and Ronnie have been staying with us. They feel terrible about what happened, but honestly, I don't know what we'd do without them. So this is all you guys do? Come to the rescue of people like us? There's not a lot of people like you. Most of the time it's people swearing they're hearing noises. Usually, it leads to nothing. So why do you guys do it? People like you. So we're the worst. No, we had one that was pretty bad. - What happened? - Angry spirit. Possessed the family dog. Dog attacked and killed their five-year-old son. They shot the dog. Aw. And the spirit went into the dad. Oh, that's terrible. The dad tried to kill his wife, but we were able to drive out the spirit in the nick of time. How? Seance. I don't think I could do what you guys do even if I had the gift. Mind if I ask, did all of you get your kicks laughing at your aunt? Oh, no. I mean, she was weird. Sometimes we'd be sitting around the dinner table, me, my brother, my mom, and we'd all be crying laughing at some of the things Aunt Marion did. What did your day say? It was his sister. You know, he never said anything. And until this very moment, I never really thought how that must have made him feel. Oh, god, I am a bad person. We've all done things we're not proud of. Yeah, well, my brother Jay would handle this way better. Something like this isn't easy for anyone. Goddamn it. Damn it, ugh. We just need to find out what Marion needs in order to forgive you. But what, what could she possibly want from me? We don't know what Marion wants from Ellyn. If we did, we could use that as a bargaining chip. Maybe we'll have a seance, blood seance. It might be the last chance we have to drag Marion's spirit from this house. Before she kills Ellyn. We sedated Ellyn for everyone's safety. Got it. You can put it on the table, Camille. Ready for this? You guys just nodded, didn't you? Oh, sorry. Yeah, all ready. I think one of you better do your mom. You're right there. Fine. Mom? I just need to poke your hand with the top of this knife, okay? Just a little prick. Good job. Let's begin. We are here for you, Aunt Marion. We welcome you to our seance. We are here for you, Aunt Marion. We welcome you to our seance. We are here for you, Aunt Marion. We welcome you to our seance. And we have company. Laughed at me. She knew that you laughed at her. She knew that you didn't care if she lived or die. She says the only one who cared about her in her family was her brother. He never even wanted a fucking daughter. You belong here. Mom. Oh, my god. Mom! Ronnie. What's happening to them? Mom, no! Mom! Come here. Go, go, go! Spirits drag me in this place by water by water and fire by fire. Let this evil be free through time and space. Though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for though art with me, thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. We did it. Chip, are you all right? I couldn't see anyway, right? This is too dangerous. Chip and Ronnie aren't coming back. And our mom has been sleeping since the seance. It's a good thing, right? Maybe it's over? Yeah. You know, you don't have to text me. I'm in the other room. I didn't know if you were sleeping or not. Who could sleep? Well, Ronnie just text me. I mean, they just left the ER. Chip's gonna be okay. Still blind but really hungry. Well, that's good news at least. What are we gonna do? Call another ghost person or somebody who knows how to deal with this. - No. No, we can't risk it. We already lost Grandma. Can we just talk about this in the morning, please? Oh, wait, wait. Would you sleep in here with me tonight? Shut up. Scoot, scoot, scoot. I need a pillow. Maybe we should call Uncle Jay. We should tell him what happened. I don't know, Mel. Uncle Jay is safe where he's at. If we call him, what if something bad happens to him? I guess you're right. Let's call him now. - Yeah. Hey, what's up? Uncle Jay. - Oh, my god, okay, listen. - Okay, we had this seance. She looks like straight shit. - We're really scared. Has she been sleeping this whole time? Yup. We tried to wake her, but she just moans and goes back to sleep. And the rope? I just figured we can't be too sure. Okay. Well, we need to get her to a hospital. There's somebody in the psych ward that can help her. This is so much more than psychological, Uncle Jay. Look at her. I know I know, but this is way out of our league, and at least she'll be safe there. And we'll be safe. Maybe when she wakes up she'll be back to normal. Can we please just wait? Okay. Until she wakes up. You guys go get some rest and I'm gonna keep watch. - Camille. - What's wrong? I'm thirsty. Girl. Camille, I'm thirsty, please. Camille. - Okay. Come on. She's sleeping. Just checking. - Oh, shit. - Camille. - Come on, let's go. - No. - Yes. - No, no, no, no. Come on, let's go. They laughed at me! He was dead! Mom, what have you done? Run! No, no, don't! Melanie! Stop! Stop it! Let's go. We gotta go now, we gotta go now. Uncle Jay, come on. Let's go. Okay, okay, I got you. I got you, I got you, I got you. Who's laughing now? I can't hold it, Camille. What do we do? - Come on, come on. Come on. Ellyn, it's me. It's your brother! Your favorite brother! Ellyn, don't do this. Don't let her do this. Ellyn, stop. Stop! Funny. Dad was the one who actually wanted to be cremated, yet we buried him. Our mom, she couldn't bear to burn her daddy. We're gonna bury her ashes with him later. We know that's what she'd want. And then tomorrow? We go to L.A. We need a little getaway. You guys can stay a while. You could stay as long as you want. Like a year? Like forever? I miss her so much. I know. Me, too. It's over now and we're gonna be okay. Uncle Jay? Fuck. Just wait here. - No. There's no way, no. No, no. Please, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hello? Uncle Jay? There's no one there. Dad! Nearly sober. Again. We were pretty angry when he came home at first, but after losing Mom, Grandma, and Uncle Jay, at least we got our dad back. Yeah. I hate that I left. I was wrong. But I'm here now, okay? And I'm never gonna leave you girls ever again. You're all I got. What's wrong? Nothing.
