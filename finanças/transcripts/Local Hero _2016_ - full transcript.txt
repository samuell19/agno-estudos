Subtitles by DramaFever [Episode 5] Come out while we ask you nicely. Min Ki... The longer you waste our time, the more you'll be beaten up. Min Ki... Min Ki! Stop it, you jerks! I told you Min Ki didn't come home! If you don't stop, I'll call 911! Oh, she's so scary... Okay, we understand, granny. We'll go now. Have a good night! Granny! They say sleeping in a cold room is good for your health! Min Ki... Why are you going to school so early? Huh? It's not like you study if you go there early. Hey, Im Soo Bin, can't you hear me talking? What? Hey, someone's trying to talk to you right now... It's your father talking... - Really? - Why are you going to school so early? Don't you have your company dinner at a bar instead of your office? Do you know why that is? It's because you hate your office. Wait, what are you saying? Then are you saying that you're going to school because you hate home? Wow... Don't talk to me knowing that I'm going through puberty unless you want to fight. Wow... puberty. It's the place to be, am I right? - Don't get out. - Hey, Im Soo Bin! Your allowance! Use it wisely. I guess you have extra money rolling around these days. You should say, "Thank you, Dad". Dad, when did you become so focused on your family? Oh, it's because I don't have much to do at work. You're not going to catch the criminals? Yes, I will. But there are criminals you must catch, and those you leave alone. But I'm responsible for a criminal I can leave alone, so I have some spare time. We'll go by ourselves from here. Bye, Dad. - Bye, Dad. - Okay, have a good day. See you for dinner! - Hi! - Is that your dad? Yes, did I tell you he's a police detective? Dad! Show them your handcuffs! - Hey, geez... - Im Yoo Bin, let's go. - Dad! - Oh, really... this kid... - Wow! It's real! - That's amazing. What do you think? My dad's cool, right? - He is! - He's so cool! Let's go... Let's go, Yoo Bin. Yoo Bin! Your dad is so cool. He's the coolest! Wow... Go to work even if there's nothing to do! It bothers me having you around. Can't I try being a good dad at a time like this? Just be yourself. If you change so suddenly, I feel weird. It's because I feel empty. My heart is so empty. Why? But... Why does your heart feel empty? Why, when we have money coming in and good things happening? I want to investigate, but I can't even do that. And if my boss tells me to do something weird I have to do it without question. I'm a man too, but my self-esteem is hitting rock bottom. So I don't even want to go to work. Hey... Don't be that way! You're doing everything in order to keep your family fed and alive. How noble is that? You deserve to have self-esteem. You're the hero of our family. Our hero. - Hero? - Of course! And what's wrong if you don't work on the investigation this time? Think of it as giving your juniors an opportunity to improve their performance. And you can continue to be a good officer within our neighborhood. A good police detective! You can catch the bad guys! And help those in need! You're really admirable. Our Detective Im! It looks like our kids got it from you. Their talking skills. Bam! What are you taking a picture of? Why are you here? Well... I just happened to pass it, so... Something crazy went down here... It hurts like hell! Can't you put it in right? I'm sorry... Miss... I told you to give it to me in pills. What is that? What gives you the right to take pictures in here, you bastard? Get lost! This bastard... - Have you lost your mind? - Sir... You little shit! Are you crazy? Learn some manners! You good for nothing little shit! I'm sorry. Is it the same person as last time? The shadow? Yes... Was it 1 on 10? Or 1 on 11? Yes, that's right. How could that be possible? For one person... Yes... that... I think... he must be someone with highly specialized training. He may have worked in the special forces, or he could have been a spy... But I don't understand why he came to this peaceful neighborhood to screw everything over. Was it this person? I don't know... Who is that? - "I don't know, I don't know..." - There are also many things I know... But, sir... Why are you taking pictures of my guys? Because the ones who keep record always win. Oh... The ones who keep record always win... - President Jo. - Yes? I told you once before. I told you to never make me take charge. That I want to work in the back. You disappointed me. Hey, tell them to apply our insurance policy and come quickly. Is it okay? Mother, I learned how close happiness is. It's within this spoon's reach. It's delicious. Did you hear about last night's incident? About what? I heard that there was a large commotion in the alley down the street. There were many guys who were hurt and were taken to the hospital. I heard that those guys were the thugs who came here to idle. Really? Well, as soon as you came yesterday, those guys left without hesitation. So I thought, maybe-- Mother... You don't have to be so formal. You can speak to me informally. - Can I do that? - Yes. Shi Yoon... Did you do it? Excuse me? I'm asking if you were the one who beat them up. No... no, Mother. I suddenly remembered what Jin Woo used to say. He told me that he was on a team with a former martial arts instructor. He said he felt reassured because of him. There were many instructors in that company... Those guys' actions may be bad... But they are all from poor families... So they're doing it to earn what they can... They shouldn't get hurt... To the parents of those boys... they are all precious sons, the apple of their eye... It was presumed that the subject was recording something of importance. What are you doing? Sorry? Baseball... baseball. Are you writing your report? You're really diligent in the early hours of the morning. "It was presumed that he was recording something of importance." "What could he be writing? Could he be writing an autobiography?" Representative. Yes. I only have to report what's related to President Hwang, right? - I can ignore everything else, right? - Why? Did something happen? He was at Neighborhood Bar all day. What was weird about that? - Oh... Writer Bae? - No. Then... the new president, Baek Shi Yoon? It's okay... You can tell me. What did Baek Shi Yoon do? That... for that, I'll do some investigating myself. - Chan Gyu. - Yes? Your only job is to monitor. Investigation is what I do. Hello. It feels like we're on field trip. How nice. Thank you for the snacks. Sure, okay. You guys are really lucky. I made up my mind today, to start living as a good officer. But hey, how did you find us here? It's a little embarrassing but I hung around the culture district a lot starting in middle school. So I made a lot of friends and many seniors. I gained access to a large information network. It doesn't take long to get information on you either. Wow... these guys are scary. So why are you here? And who hit you? After you let me off the hook, I made up my mind to live properly. I was going to work part-time until I enlisted in the army. But I have three seniors above me. They were the guys I went around with, robbing markets and convenience stores. I told them I was out, but they said they wouldn't let me. They will continue to rob, but they're afraid of information leaking out. That's why they're beating me up. Weren't you hit by multiple guys yesterday in the culture district? And then someone came to save you. Someone wearing a hat and a mask. Min Ki... Yes, that's right. How did you know? How did you know that? I saw it when I was passing by. But I don't think this is something you should laugh about. So are you here to ask for my help? Yes... And I live with my grandmother, so I can't run away by myself. Okay, got it. Tell me their names. I'll go and put them in their place. - But it won't be easy. - Why? There is a guy called Han Gyul... He's the top in combined martial arts. He was even on cable television before. But this guy doesn't care whether you're older, an adult, or an officer. He's crazy. He can win against multiple guys. Oh... combined... martial arts? Okay. Okay, sure... We have officers who are good at martial arts too. Officer. And... I... It's okay, you can tell me. Just until it calms down... Could I stay here with my grandmother for a few days? Wow... Hello. Welcome. Did... I come too early? Since Writer Bae isn't even here yet, it's a little early. But it's okay. Would you like some coffee? Yes, coffee. Thank you. But Chan Gyu, aren't you doing that job anymore? The job where you monitored retired public officials. You should be working around this time... So... sir. - Yes? - Can I call you sir? Um... but why... I look up to you... Sir Shadow. Wait a second! What are you saying, Chan Gyu? Writer Bae is saying that you're the shadow so why are you putting that title on me? I saw everything last night. The magnificent 1 on 10 battle. - There was a fight somewhere? - Hey... I'm telling you, I saw everything. You are... How do you say it... You were... strong to the point of being unreal. So, sir. Please teach me martial arts. Sorry? Please teach me martial arts. Your powerful martial arts skills. Oh, you're already here! I apologize... I asked to meet here because my next appointment is here as well. But... is there something urgent? The workers of the subcontractor service company under us are hurt badly. What happened? They were attacked. With knives. - By who? - Please catch him for me. Every day is precious to us. The Hallyu Core Mall project is being shaken from the very start. But wait... who is disturbing the neighborhood this way? Are they trying to ruin the district's economy or what? It's a humiliation that there is such an impure element under our jurisdiction. We must eliminate this quickly! - President. - Yes? If you wear the same watch every day, it'll be ruined. Here... Men are different from women. If a man wants a diamond, he must receive it within a watch. Wait, then... this is all... diamonds? If a legal company becomes discouraged due to some attacks... - Yes? - The citizens will be furious. And the ones who are also participating in this business... The main investors? My network with them... So are you... a secret agent like James Bond of 007? Why are you asking that, Chan Gyu? Would someone like that run a bar? I became like this because I liked sports and martial arts from an early age. But not everyone who likes martial arts tries to become the shadow. What's the exact meaning of "the shadow"? A person who helps weak victims, in a quiet and secretive manner. I just became involved by accident, and couldn't escape... Sir. Please teach me martial arts. - What will you do if I do? - I want to become the shadow too. I want to continue after you, and become the next shadow. - Chan Gyu. - Yes? Don't become the shadow. You have your own job to do. And you have to take your exam to become an officer. I'm being serious. It's the first time feeling my heart heat up so much. I also want to become a good fighter so I can help powerless victims. There are studios everywhere for that, so why are you asking me? But your martial arts are different. I saw you with my own two eyes. Chan Gyu. Take a look into your own heart. You don't actually want to become the shadow. - What you want is to date Writer Bae. - What? You said you want to be Writer Bae's shadow. - Oh, but that's... - You like Writer Bae, don't you? Have you confessed your feelings to her? Have you been on a date with her? Have you had one meal with her? No, right? That's why I'm telling you to look into your own heart. Do you truly have a flaming desire for justice that makes you want to protect the law and safety of the neighborhood? Or do you simply want to be Writer Bae's shadow so you can be by her side? Hello. Hello. Regarding the shadow, try everything else first in the right order. We'll talk then. Okay. What you're saying makes sense, so I'll do as you say. But sir, don't ever forget this. What? That I... know... your S-E-C-R-E-T. - Writer Bae? - Yes? Can we... start from the beginning? From the very beginning. - What are you talking about? - From the beginning. So, I'll introduce myself first. My name is Choi Chan Gyu. My hometown is Cheonan in Chungnam. I graduated from a P.E. specialized school. Now I'm in the midst of preparing for an exam to become a police officer. I'm young without much stability, but I'm living as a good and law abiding citizen. So, would you like to go on a date with me? Okay! Go ahead. I won't take it off the paycheck. I'm a man myself. The desire to satisfy our urges while we still can... I'm the same way. So I understand your feelings, one hundred percent. But seeing one woman consistently, while you help us with our project... I can't possibly catch up to the pure love that you have. What is it that you want, you bastard? I was going to suggest a very simple cooperation. But seeing your cold attitude... I will pretend like this never happened. Oh. Your daughter's wedding is coming soon. Congratulations. Your future in-laws... had better not find out about this... I'm... I'm sorry... I... made a mistake... I... suddenly had my pride get the best of me... I... I was wrong! Oh no, did you hurt your leg? I... really shouldn't have acted that way. I am... very... sorry... Oh no, it looks like it hurts a lot. - Sorry? - Let's take a look. No... no, no... I'm...I'm okay... Wow, nice watch. It looks good. Oh, this? It's something I borrowed. I borrowed it. Please give me these photos... and please delete any copies you have... Your team... is responsible for investigating Seo Jun Suk's case. So please cease the investigation. The deceased officer was a member of our team. Oh... yes, is that so? He was someone who worked overseas. Due to his death, there are diplomatic and international relations issues. It is a very sensitive situation. We will take over the investigation. - Good day. - You're here. As I was passing the culture district... I heard an impressive rumor going around. 1 on 10? I heard many were hurt as well. I had no choice, because they had knives. Getting revenge for a team member who died... Or helping that team member's mother and neighbors... as the shadow of the neighborhood... Which one do you think is more rewarding? It was an unexpected accident. I should focus back on my original plan. Revenge? Sir... I didn't rot away in prison for three years to become the shadow. I understand. And now, those guys are starting to tighten in on us. Don't you think I can solve that problem independently? Independently? How? This would be the time to cooperate with politics. Hello. - Hello. - You never came this early before. I made an agreement to meet the new president for a veteran meeting. What about Se Yoon? My mother will pick him up from kindergarten. She could bring him here. You're really not the shadow, right? It's possible that the shadow you're talking about is close by. A lot closer than you would think. So are you saying that it's you? Or not? I am not the shadow. Do you know something? No. But I'm curious all of a sudden. What does he do... Does he run his own private business? Even with his mask, I could tell that he was really handsome with a good body. Hey... it didn't seem like he was better looking than me though. Here, you have something on your face. Wipe it off. You could have done it for me. When you thought that I was the shadow... I felt like I became a very important person. So I will do the same to make you feel important too. When you're with me. With all the sincerity that a man can give out of pure love. Don't you think that dating is too much of a luxury for us? We have important things that we have to do first. You have to pass your exam... And I have a 50 million won contest for script writing to enter. But the deadline is next week. The problem is that I've only finished half of it. I have to write the remaining half of the script. But when will I do that? Then I guess I need to wait one week. Until we can start dating. Chan Gyu, you have a very positive personality. I'll accept it as an attractive trait. And... we... should start speaking to each other informally. I filed a missing person's report, but I don't think there's a mistake. He was a strong man. As a civil rights lawyer, he faced ridiculous situations and threats. But he endured and conquered all of it. He will conquer this time, as well. I am sure that he's still alive... We won't give up until the very end. Due to his client, and Seo Jun Suk's case as well we are investigating this deeply. All I have to do is give you his laptop? Yes, his computer in this office as well as his laptop. If we analyze the hard drives of both computers, we will get some clues. But... What grades are your children in? Grade 5 and Grade 3. They're in the same grades as my children. Their father should be here to take them to school. Tae Ho, it's your loss if you don't eat. Why are you emotional over their family's matters? Then maybe you should have investigated harder from the beginning. It's not right to look the other way just so I can get what I want... No one is looking the other way. Don't act like you're the only one who cares. I can't eat anymore. - Did you eat a lot, Joon Hee? - Yes. I'd like to pay, please! - Hey, why? - Newstar Invest. Why do you have their corporate card? Then did you think I would pay for this with my own money? But Newstar Invest is the company that's building the Hallyu Core Mall. She's waiting. Single payment. But I'm asking... Why do you have another company's corporate card? It was a sign of their sincerity for working under the same jurisdiction. So that we can have meals like this with our team members. Hey... That's... that's not right... Why? Are you going to report it to the main headquarters? It's not that! Why do you get one, and I don't? If you feel wronged, get promoted. Hey, I'm the best officer on your team. And you have to treat the working-level staff for everything to run smoothly. Wow, the Newstar Invest representative... He is unpredictable... Can we meet on the west side? - What is the matter, sir? - I had some things to talk about. - Tae Ho. - Yes. I'm sorry about what happened last time. Because my boss was pressuring me so hard... I guess I... lost my mind... The intelligence agency has taken over this investigation. So do you really have to mess things up by meddling in their affairs? Is it difficult to listen to me when I tell you not to do something? You hate singing the national anthem, don't you? I really shouldn't have gone that far. Anyways, I want to formally apologize to you. Oh, and this. - What is it? - Give it to your wife. The wife needs to be excited in order for the husband to get what he wants too. You don't have to do this... Take it. You're going to take it anyways. So the reason I'm here... - Your employee, Choi Chan Gyu... - Yes. To that lad... Give him these instructions. Tell him he needs to find out what President Hwang is recording. Yes. And... I heard that Lawyer Jo's computers were taken by your officers... How did you know? I'm sorry, but could you bring that to me? What do you plan on doing with the evidence? The reason is... Our side is also investigating Seo Jun Suk's case. And they asked for a copy of the hard drives. I'm asking you because it's urgent. It'll only take a moment. And make sure to win some points with your wife. Hey, Sang Gyun. How can you put such important pieces of evidence on the floor? Oh, yes. Oh, and the cyber investigation team asked to see you for a moment. - Why? - I don't know, go and see. Don't call them, talk to them directly. Team Leader Yoo hates phone calls. They're the cyber team, but they hate communication? - Get going! - Okay... Oh... but this doesn't look like a machine that copies hard drives. - Tae Ho. - Yes. Out of the public workers who know national secrets... You know that many live without rest, don't you? I've never heard that before. But all of those people... really have no time to rest. After finding out a national secret during a mission they could turn their backs and report to the enemies... Or the person who must fulfill the secretive mission could be problematic... If they start to become doubtful... people can die from being overworked in those situations. And very few know the details. Find out what President Hwang is recording by the end of today. It's urgent. My back hurts... Maybe I'll try sitting over there. - Chief Min. - Chief Min? Don't you know who it is? I don't know. The man who came every day to practice magic tricks. - Oh... - He's famous. He's also known as Chief Min. He's an expert of document forgery, falsification, and fabrication. He was famous in the intelligence agency. But he was suddenly discharged when I was there. To put it simply, he's a skilled, hands-on con-artist. If you could get that person on board, it would make your life a lot easier. But why did such a famous agent leave the intelligence agency? That's the first thing we need to find out. That's how we'll know if we can trust him or not. Then... why did you... Why was I fired from the agency? Why did you trust me from the beginning? You didn't seem like someone who would deceive people. Just by first impression? Are you always this careless? What did you learn when we worked in the agency? As I was processing data in the agency, I kept noticing some troubling facts. The event three years ago when Bay Star Hong Kong took over the Korean Commerce Bank. It was obviously suspicious... so our agents planned and executed the mission. The mission was ceased abruptly, and any records of it were erased. It was strange, so I brought the problem back into focus... What do you think happened after that? Dismissal? Only trust people in situations like this, okay? [Hoe] Hoe... Sashimi rice. Revolving door... Chairman... Memoirs? It was memoirs... President Hwang told me... that an agent who participated in the mission three years ago said... that everything was connected. I was a part of the mission three years ago... and lost my closest colleague as a result. Mom. Mom, what brings you here without notice? Mother? Yes. - Mom! - Hi, Se Yoon. - Mister! - Hi, Se Yoon. So you came straight here, huh? Our Se Yoon wouldn't stop talking about wanting to see you. Wow... Are we having a family party today? Hello... Are you the father and mother? Excuse me? I knew Shi Yoon wanted a stable lifestyle... But it looks like you made a huge decision. You attained a large family in such a short period of time. What? Your father remarried, and he's doing well. And I don't have a strong prejudice against people who remarry. Come on, I'm telling you it's not like that. I like that woman, that part-time server. - Writer Bae? - Yes. She's young, healthy, and bright. That's enough, Mom. And why did you want to talk here? Your son has a perfectly good store that we can talk in. It's because I don't want the others to hear. What is it? The intelligence agency guys came by the house. They did have good manners... But they came inside and went through all of our belongings. Because my firearms were not properly returned, right? You knew? That was for administrative purposes. The investigation is already over. I'm sorry... because of me... - You... forgave them right? - What? I told you to forgive everyone. Your company, and all. I don't live with many thoughts these days. You know when you watch one of those dramas... There are guys who are stuck in the past and put their lives at risk for revenge. My thoughts are... that revenge is for people who have no hope to live with nothing they enjoy in life. Because they have nothing to look forward to. But the way I see it, you can't get revenge. Why? Your facial expression is bright. And you're really happy. While working at the bar you get to meet people and have fun so you're really happy! Right? I brought oriental raisins. Make sure to eat them. And don't easily take all the drinks that your customers give you. - I like that server. Writer Bae. - Mom! Isn't it that computer? Were you the one who took it? We were scared that it disappeared! Oh, this? There was a lot of dust in it, so I cleaned it off outside. Why are you treating the evidence with so much care? And the cyber team leader wasn't looking for me. Oh, really? I must be out of my mind... He is recording this memoir. He is assumed to be recording his testimony of the past. Try harder, it doesn't work? Sir, what did you do with these? I told you, I dusted them off. But these... are completely useless. There is no data at all. In cases like this, it means a machine was used to wipe out all the data. What are you talking about? Lawyer Jo's two computer hard drives... are fried. What did Tae Ho do? He... took them outside-- Hey! I said I just dusted it off! Hey, Im Tae Ho. Geez... Hey, Im Tae Ho! What? Collect all the evidence of this case and put them away in storage. Sorry? Seo Jun Suk's murder case and Lawyer Jo's missing case will both be ceased. It was the director's orders. But still, a person was killed... We must close these two cases, and start investigating a new case. Let's move. Hey, were you guys hurt? Us? Hey, we were beaten up two times already. But maybe he had a cold, but he went easy on us this time? Who? The shadow, that person... might be a real hero. A real hero? Please take a look. Excuse me, officer. This is my card. Were you beaten up for no reason? Over ten of you, by one person? So... couldn't it be someone who is strongly against Hallyu Core Mall? Yes, but I'm asking... How were you all beaten up by one guy? You guys all use your fists too. I think... he could be from the special forces... or a spy... Why would a spy get involved in something like this? Why are you all worked up in a hospital? What are we doing with these thugs after closing an unsolved murder case? What? Thugs? Hey... Let's just go. Let's put everything aside for today, and drink our sorrows away. Mister. Who are you calling a thug? And you're going to drink at this hour? Who are you calling a thug? Do you know them? Yes, we went to high school together. I can tell by their looks. I was working at Gangjoong 20 years ago, as well. What was amazing was... our culture district was the most quiet with the least crimes in the country. Really? There were rumors going around back then too... - Rumors? - What rumors? Someone always appeared and caught the bad guys at night. What? Who could it be? The shadow... Hey, wait! Stop the car! Hurry! - Hey, why? - Go ahead, I'll follow you after. Where are you going? Hey, Im Soo Bin! Where did you follow me from? Why are you embarrassing me like this? Who are those guys? Why aren't you at school? Look at the time! School is over! - Hey, come here. - Why are you doing this? Is it illegal to come to a karaoke room? Arrest them, then. Your uniforms are different. They're from different schools. - Show me your student identification. - They're my friends! What kind of friends? When, where, and how did you meet them? This is so annoying! Hey, let's go. I told you to give me your student identification! Don't give it to him. Hey, the girl to boy ratio! It doesn't even match up! What are you doing here? Why are you hanging around here? Are you trying to rip off money like old times? Hey, one second! Stop! Hey, look here. What are you doing? I can't live because of you! Hey, Min Ki. Hey... So... I have a favor to ask you. You said that you have a large network, right? Yes... So... Look into who they are and what they're like in detail. I have a feeling that my daughter is going in a bad direction. If she goes wrong now, then it's over for her. She won't even go to college. I'll send you this picture right away. If I go around to look into this I could get caught by Han Gyul and the guys. That's okay. Call me if you meet them, and I'll be there like a bullet. You're tired, aren't you? What? Your perseverance is pretty impressive. Dream? What... You were sitting here without moving for several hours. Oh... perseverance? Am I not allowed to read this? It's not the right time. This one book is not all of it. Things I heard in the 30 years I spent in the agency... and what I heard in the 20 years at this bar. How much information would that be? Why did you start this project? Because the truth needs to be recorded. The truth... Since I tossed them some bait they probably became very curious about the memoirs. After that... Politics and cooperation. To find out what those guys want to know... I'm going to monitor, starting today. Chief Min. Sorry for the late greeting. I was also an agent three years ago. I just remembered something I learned as a trainee. A simple card trick that is used to get close to a woman. I wanted to hear why someone like you left the intelligence agency. I have some hurt as well, and wanted to find someone I can relate to. The reason I come here... is because I'm lonely. Please don't try to use a lonely man to your benefit. I'm not sure if I'll come back here anymore. I'm not trying to use you, Chief Min. - I just wanted to share my loneliness. - You don't know how to lie. You learned it all wrong. - You're going so abruptly again. - I am? - I'm suddenly sleepy. - Are you following President Hwang? No. Why would I? Jung Yeon. I was really happy to be in the same space as you all day long. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Writer Bae. I'm sorry, but I have somewhere urgent to go. I'll be back before closing time. Call me if there's anything wrong. Oh, and a customer told me that you're healthy, young, and bright. Who? - Who said that? - My mom. But what made you tell me that yourself? Well... because it's the truth. Seriously... What will I do with my popularity? At 9:25 p.m. he is going home. I didn't know you'd come for me so soon. I'm sorry for coming at such a late hour. I knew someone would come... but I didn't know it would be you. Well my job is to manage the retired agents. How about we talk inside? It's about the memoirs, isn't it? Yes, you knew. That kind of talk should take place where there are a lot of people. A place where other people can see... A safe place... Let's go. Okay! Since we're having a bad day, let's drink as much as we can. We'll order, drink, order, drink! Hey, Tae Ho. Here. Why don't you pay for this? Think of this card as yours. Order and pay for everything! Without hesitation! Hey... Did something happen? Sorry, but Jun Hee, don't drink. You have to drive, so only drink that. Let's drink! Hey, what are you doing? You should have poured these already. Yes, Min Ki. Did you look into it? They're both from Onsong High School. I don't think you have to worry. They are both in college, and I heard they're good guys. Their grades are average... They're popular with the girls, but they're not players. One guy is in the broadcasting class, and the other does soccer after school. They went to the same middle school as your daughter. You're sure, right? Okay. Hey, thanks. You really do have a large network. Okay, okay, sure. Okay. Okay! Hey, order one more bottle of this. Let's drink! Pour me a glass. Let's drink until it flows through our veins! - Did you just tell me to drink? - Yes, sir. Did you have some? Who do you think you're talking to? Here, have a snack. Min Ki... You should have been hiding, but you've been investigating instead? Wow... you're brave, huh? Let's go out. - No, no, you can't! - Granny, you should stay. - Min Ki! Oh no! - He'll be back. - Come out here. - Min Ki! - Let go of Min Ki! - Don't come, grandma. I'll call 911. Oh, no. Oh, no. Grandma, don't come. Go inside. I'm the shadow... Shadow... Shadow... You must be crazy! You'll be punished for this! Shadow... I'm the shadow... I'm the shadow... Shadow. Let's go... okay? Stop, you guys. Stop right there! "Stop, you guys"? Oh... Aren't you that idiot from last time? Why, are you going to run away? You said you're confident in running. You go around wearing a mask... Chan Gyu, what's wrong? What's going on? Are you okay? Those three are harassing this one. But be careful. That kid is really good at combined martial arts. - Who? - Me. Let's fight. Kid, just go home. You'll get hurt. Why don't you stop now? Let's go. Go to the hospital first, and don't bother Min Ki from now on. - Got it? - Yes, yes. But how did you find us? Did you follow me here? It wasn't you. I was following those guys. I heard that there were some troublemakers in this neighborhood. Are you okay? Should we go back to Neighborhood Bar and have a drink? Sure. - But, sir. - You don't have to be formal. You told me to look deep into my heart, so I did... And it's not because of Writer Bae. I really want to become the shadow. My body naturally moves to serve justice. Without even realizing it. The heart of an insignificant and unemployed student has been lit up. This must be destiny. I was destined to become the shadow... Hey, hey, hey! My ears hurt! What kind of song interpretation is that? Huh? I'm sorry. We had a drink before coming here. And we are sorry again... for not catching the culprit. Even though we haven't... please forget everything, and rest in peace. Attention. Bow. Okay. Let's go. [Seo Jun Suk] I... How do I say it? Power and authority seem to be all that matters nowadays... I'm not even a police officer. One month of planning, but the excavator didn't come in... I'm very sorry. Sorry? This is a business that costs two trillion won over three years...

The police won't act the way we want them to... I'd better look for him myself... The shadow... Oh, will you do that? I will look into how this all started.
