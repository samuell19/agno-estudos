- What you doing? - Walking. - You're late. - It doesn't matter. Everyone's late. It's just revision. - You're not everyone. - I'm meeting Alex. Alex is a girl. - Josh, get in the car. - Mom. Fine. - Put your seatbelt on. ♫ I think I'm meant to be on my own ♫ Through the path I take all myself by me ♫ I think I'm meant to be on my own ♫ Have a good day. Bring Alex around, if she's nice. - Yeah, right. ♫ Starting up ♫ I know you're hurting even now ♫ I got the letter you sent me in the mail ♫ Thought it meant you were moving on ♫ - What? - What? - Thought you were meeting Alex, who's a girl. - Aren't I? - She's a cracker. - Who says cracker? - I say cracker and she is. She's a cracker. Lovely stuff. - Josh. - Hello. You forgot your peacoat again. - What? - I need a word. - Auntie Bethan. - Don't call me that, son, it makes me feel like I'm 60. - What are you doing? - I just need to talk to you for a minute. Do you mind, Sam? - Sure thing. - How's your mom? - She's smashing, thanks. - Good. - I'll see you there, Joshy boy. - No, it's fine. My mom's just leaving. - Josh, please. - It's all right, mate. No sweat. I'll see you there. See you around, Auntie Bethan. - What are you doing? - Not here. Not in school. - Why not in school? - I need a word. - No. - I'm sorry if I've embarrassed you. - What's wrong? - Nothing is wrong. - Good. I'll see you later, then. - Josh. I need you to get back in the car. This is stupid. What's going on? Nothing. That's not true, is it? Give me a minute, Josh, please. Where are you taking me? - I don't know. - You don't know? What are we doing? - We're just going for a drive. - What're you talking about? - We're going for a drive. Maybe a walk. - It's raining. - It's going to clear up. - I can't just miss school. - You can. - Mom. - It's nothing. I just want us to spend the day together. - Why? - Because I do. - Just you and me? - Yes. - Just take me back to school. - No, Josh. You've got your bag. You don't need your bag. It's turning nice now. - How long are we gonna be? - I don't know. - It's Friday. I've got football. - You can miss football. - What? - You'll be back for football. - Good because I'm not missing football. - So where do you wanna go then, Josh? We can go anywhere. - Home. - Ha. Funny. - Not really a joke. - It's a day off. Day's off are great. They're rare. Oh come on, love. There is so much space out here. What do you think? - Nah. It's not short on space, Mom. - All right? - I don't know. - That's okay. - What do you want me to say? - Say whatever you think, Josh. That's all. - About what? - About whatever you like. - I don't know. - That's a start. - So this is what we're doing? - Ah, the air, Josh. The air out here is great. You know, we're 15 miles down the road, we may as well be 15 thousand. - You take me out of school so I can sniff the air? - Yes. - All right, stop. Mom! Stop! - What? - You know what. - I don't, love. - You take me out of school and we go on a bloody nature walk. I don't get it. - There's nothing to get. - We come up here all the time. - No we don't. When was the last time? - I'm not counting. It doesn't matter. The thing is, why can't we go on Sunday with dad? - We've never done this. You and me. - So? - So it's about time that we did. So that's what we're doing, you know? We can talk. - We always talk. - Oh, no we don't. - I don't wanna talk. - Okay, that's fine. Let's enjoy the walk and you don't have to say a word. Have you ever been out to Worm's Head? - With you and dad. - No, we've never taken you. I'd remember. - We went on a geography trip. Sam and Joe pissed in the sea from the rocks. - Sounds fun. - Not for Joe. Mrs. Miller went mental and gave him a week's suspension. - I miss all that. Field trips are just an excuse to mess about with your mates. You know, she how much you can wind up the teacher. And you'd be there, getting toed off, trying your hardest not to laugh. That would wind them up even more. - Right. - I've never actually been out there. Not actually along it. I've lived here most of my life. - Must have. - No, never. Promise. Granddad said it wasn't worth the effort. - It's all right. - It really does look like a big worm. - It's not a worm, worm. - Sorry? - Vorm is viking for dragon. They thought it looked like one. - Ha. Now you mention it. Let's go out there now. What do you think the tide's doing? - No idea. One of two ways, isn't it? - Well I'm betting on out, yeah? And is we drown, you can sue me. Come on. Come on. Let's have lunch. Get some fish and chips. - Mom, I need to get back to school. - We need to eat. We can head over to Port Eynon and get some fish and chips and eat them on the beach. It'll be fun. - None of this is fun. - Okay. It'll be fun for me. - Great. - Morning. Lovely day. - Yes it is. I don't think you need a compass around here. - No. - All right? - Yep. - Still weird? - Yep. - It's just a day. - You've said. - What should we talk about? What do you like? Music. Let's talk about music. - No. - What do you mean, no? You can't just say no. - I don't wanna talk about music. - How about Alex? What sort of music does she like? - Don't talk about Alex. - Sorry. Wasn't prying. - You are. - I am. Sometimes music is the reason some people get together. - We're not talking about Alex. There's nothing to say about Alex. - Except for the fact that she is a girl. - Except for that. - Do you like music? - Yes, I like music. Music is good. - Change the subject then. - You know I like music. I've got a computer full of music. You can check it out if you want. You won't find anything dodgy. - To tell you the truth, Josh, I couldn't have a clue what music you like. You spend every waking minute with headphones in your ears. - What do you expect me to do? Dad goes nuts if I play it normally. It doesn't matter. I like using my headphones. - He's not always right. - It's fine. I like my headphones. - Do you still like those ones with the white faces? - They're all right. - I like them. - You don't. You're too old. - I'm not that old. - You're pretty old. - They're American, aren't they? - Yeah. - Do you like any British bands? Welsh bands? - What? Like Tom Jones? - Bless him, no. - I like the Super Furry Animals, The Manics are okay, Stereophonics are crap. - You like the Super Furry Animals? - Yeah, they're all right. - I saw them. - No you didn't. - Years ago, before you were born. Your dad took me to a horrible little place in Cardiff. It was when all that stuff was in Welsh. Didn't understand a word. - It was good then? - You know, I can't remember. All I remember is it was very, very hot. And their name. Their name stuck. I felt old then. I wasn't. But I had a steady boyfriend. We did everything as a couple. Two years earlier, I was cutting edge. - You lived in Swansea. - I was different. I was in love with Michael Stipe. - Who's that? - Who's Michael Stipe? You seriously don't know who he is. - Nope. Is he famous? - I was in love with him way before "Losing My Religion." I had Green on tape and Susie had their early stuff on vinyl. "Murmur," "Reckoning," "Life's Rich Pageant." We weren't just band wagoners. - Who are you talking about? - R-E-M. - Rem? - Yes, Josh, Rem. They were the band... Doesn't matter. - Doesn't work up here. - Good, it's probably for the best. He had hair back then. And didn't believe Susie when she said he was gay. - Dad was in a band. - He was. - Says they were good. - He would. - So were they? - No. Not really. - They were all right. They were a bit different. Everybody else was doing dance stuff. Your dad and his mates played guitar very loudly and often quite badly. They were all right. They weren't boring to watch. There was this gig at the Brunswick. It was all right. It was pretty packed. Then after about the third song someone threw a pint at your dad's mate, Jimmy, on bass. So he threw his back at the crowd and the next minute there is this massive beer fight with glasses flying everywhere and this is before they used plastic ones. Everything was soaked. Then eventually the PA cut out and that was it. That was one of their better gigs. - Sounds bad. - It wasn't. Well, it was. But it didn't matter. Your dad was a hero all over one end of town. And he was thin and cool and talented. Pretty talented. And it was all such a laugh. - You started going out with dad because he was cool and he played in a band? - Well he was cool. He was a boy with a guitar. That's as good as a reason as any to fancy someone. - Fancy someone. - What do you say then? - We say that too. - All right, come on. Fish and chips. Nothing else will do. - There we go. Is it heavy? Looks quite heavy. I kind of not been at the gym this week. Otherwise, I would've done it myself. There we go. All right? Can you manage? Easy does it. Because it can get all rilled up, apparently. I think that's what he said. I knew what he meant. Thank you. Thank you, that's marvellous. Won't drink it all myself, promise. Maybe I will. Josh? Thought it was you. - Hello. - Hi. Josh's mom? Hello there. - Hi. I'm Tess Roberts, Sophie's mom. Oh, hi. - I've given Josh lots of lifts home. Various parties and the like out at ours. Haven't I, Josh? - Yeah. - I'm Bethan. - Hi Bethan, it's lovely to meet you. Why haven't we met before? How mysterious. Do you know Cath, Sam's mom? - Yeah, she's an old friend. - Sam's a nice kid, isn't he? And Josh too, of course. They've all been out to ours a few times, hence the lifts. - Yeah I know, that's very kind of you. - Not at all. It's my punishment for living so far out of town. Sophie hates it, she says. She says none of her friends can be bothered to trek all the way out to ours. - Well. Must be good to have all the space. - Yeah it is. Even if it does mean dragging drunk 17 year olds out to our, otherwise, immaculate flowerbed several times a year. - Well, I hope Josh isn't-- - Mom. - Josh, no he's an angel, Bethan. Isn't that right, Josh? - Yeah. - Only drinks filtered spring water. - Takes after his mom. - I'm sure. - Seriously, Josh has never been any trouble. - Well, it's good of you to put up with them all. - Yeah. Listen, they're all gonna drink cheap booze, dance to shit music and rub each other whatever. I'd rather do it somewhere safe. - You're very brave. - Oh well, very brave. Very stupid. Sophie's really good at the cleaning up. That's the deal. Clean carpets. Garden free of bodies and pants. It's a green light the next time she wants a party. Plus the fact that Sophie has to waitress when we have parties. - Oh really? - Yeah, why should he have all the fun? We're embarrassing Josh by getting on so well. No, you're right, Josh. I do tend to choncher on. I do. Sorry. Lovely to meet you, Bethan. You off out for the day? No school? - No, not today. Josh needs a break. A bit of fresh air. - With his mom? That's lovely. There's a lot of stress for them these days. Sophie's weighed down. - It's been lovely to meet you. - Yeah, you too, Bethan. Yeah. I don't want you to drive off thinking I'm a raging alcoholic. - We won't. - It's not all for me. We're having a little bit of a barbecue later. Yeah. Have fun. - I will, thanks. Listen, if you're not doing anything later, you should come along. It's nothing formal. It's just a few friends. You know, a few drinks. That kind of thing. - That's kind, but we've got things to get on with. - Next time maybe. Next time. It's fun. You get to be waited on by a stroppy teenager. Not that she's much good at it. You've be good though, Josh. You should come. There's free beers in it for you. - Okay, well thanks. Next time. - Bye. - Okay, whatever. Josh, you know where we live if you change your mind. Bye. - Bye then. - That's 2.20, change. - Thanks. - What can I get you? - Two cod and chips, please. - Anything else with that? - A couple of Cokes. - Sure thing. There you go. That's 12.50, please. Thanks, love. That's 2.50 change. Not bad out today, is it? - Typical sunshine and showers. - You never know. We might have a summer this year. - That would be good. - Have a good day, love. - Thank you. You too. - Next, please. - Mom! - Must be from the caravans. - Who? - Those people. Remember that caravan in Devon? - Yeah. - That was fun. - It was horrible. You even said it was horrible. - Well, the weather wasn't great. Or the neighbours. And you were sick everywhere for two days straight. - Dad got into a fight. - He was defending me. I thought it was pretty brave at the time. - Just remember all that blood in that tiny, little sink. - It was easily washed away. You weren't meant to see that. You were meant to be asleep. - I was six inches away in the world's most uncomfortable bed. - No secrets in a caravan. - Or sleep. Or room. - I wanted you to enjoy yourself. - The slide was good. Some of the kids were all right. I don't know why we didn't go home though. - Because that's not what you do. - Would've been sensible. - That's not the same thing. It's strange when you think about it. Two weeks stuffed into a tiny, tiny house with flimsy walls, a mechanical toilet. Cooking food on crappy little stoves. Playing cards. Watching the rain. Good awning. - You're not funny. - Says you. - You could ask anyone on this beach and they'd tell you you're not funny. - Well they could all be wrong. - Dad's funny. Don't you think? He's pretty funny. - He can be. - You're never nice about him. - That's not true. Even today I've been nice about him. - That was the past. - It's still being nice. - What about now? - I'm nice about him now. - To me. - To anyone. - To him? - I don't know what you're trying to say. These are good. - All right. - Mine are delicious. How's the revision? - It's taking a bit of a knock today. - You'll cope. Seriously, how's it going? - You know how it's going. - Not really. I ask, you say "fine" and that's it. - That's right. It's going fine. - Next year? - Don't know. We'll see, won't we. - University. - Maybe. - Maybe? - I don't know. I'm not sure about Uni. We had this UCAS talk the other day and it all sounded amazing. You meet great people and brilliant things. All that stuff. It's probably right, isn't it? If that's what you like. Then afterwards there was this bloke and he was trying to be all matey with us, like he was one of us. And he was meant to be talking about student finance, but he kept saying things like, "Money is a such a drag, kids, you know? "Totally boring but really important." He was a twat. - So. - So I can get a grant but I still have to borrow loads of money. - That's okay, Josh. That's what you have to do these days. - I finish the course, get a degree and then there's no job anyway. Plus, I'll be in all this debt. - Don't be so negative. - I'm realistic. You've seen the news. There's no jobs. Just shit jobs. Temp jobs. Factory jobs. I could do all those without a degree. - But you're better than that. You're better than here. - What's wrong with you? You moved here. - I was 10, Josh. I didn't really have much say. - Why didn't you move back then? Back to Devon if it's so rubbish. - It's not rubbish, Josh. It's fine. It's just that you need to see somewhere else. - Like Cardiff. - I'm being serious. - I'm not going to London. Dick Whittington was named that for a reason. - What's wrong with London? You've already been there once. - I didn't like it. - Okay, not London. What about Manchester or Edinburgh or Rome? - Or Rhyl. I could move in with Great Aunt Glenys. Do some chores around the house, read her the newspaper. - Whatever you do, Josh, you must promise me that you'll work hard and you will make the best of everything. - I can't promise. - About university, Josh. - For God's sake, Mom. - Whatever you do, just promise me that you will work hard and make the best of everything. Don't be like all the rest. That's all I'm saying. - All right. - Promise me, Josh. Please. - Who are all the rest anyway? - Nobody. - So you don't even know who all the rest are? - I just mean the people around here. - The piss heads and the druggies? - Of course. - Or the poor. - What? - Or do you mean the stupid? The ones who aren't cleaver enough to go to university, who have to make do with the tale end Swanseas. Do you mean them? - There's nothing wrong with that. - No, there's not. Or do you mean you? - Why wouldn't I want things to be better for my child then they were for me? That's only natural. - Yeah? - I want you to do well, Josh. I want you to be brilliant. I mean, you are brilliant. I want you to be so happy. - That's what you're meant to see. - What do you mean by that? - It's a parent thing, isn't it? - I can't help speaking like a parent, Josh. - But it's a parent speech, isn't it? One minute it's about how babies are made and the next it's about working hard and being sensible in your career choice. - But I mean it. And this hasn't anything to do with careers. This is to do with living life and thriving and moving forward. - Like you? - That's enough. - Or are you just guilty because you fucked up? This is why we don't talk, Mom. - Why don't we talk? - I don't want to. - You have to. Sometimes you have to. - On every other day when we randomly go on walks together? - We should've done more. We should've. It's difficult. - Yeah. Seems like it is. - Don't swear at me, Josh. Don't ever swear at me. - Sorry. - And don't judge me, Josh. Not yet. - I hear you. You know that I hear you. I mean, you do that loud whisper thing, but we don't live in a big house. In books they always burry their heads into their pillows. I just used to throw myself up into the duvet and push my fingers into my ears. It's easy, you know? Just use iTunes. Shove it on shuffle and fall asleep. - You shouldn't have to. - Doesn't matter. That's how it is. I was right about talking. Doesn't get you anywhere. - We both love you very much. - Yeah. - More than anything. You're the best thing that ever happened. We're both so proud of you. - You don't have to go on, Mom, really. - Well it hurts me to think that you hear that stuff. - I said it's fine. - We do really love you. - Yeah, just not each other. - That's not true. - It is true. Seems that way. It sounds like it. - When I met your dad, it was like the most wonderful thing. Like I was blessed. I finally understood what was important. He made me laugh, he took me out, he worked so hard. He still does. And then you came along and everything was perfect. - But it's not like that now, is it? - Nothing ever stays still. - What does that mean? - Things that you were once sure of, things that seemed easy, they become difficult. - Fine. I'll understand one day, right? - I hope so. - Look Mom, I wanna go home now. I'm not missing football. - We've got loads of time. - I don't wanna be here anymore. - You can be angry. It's okay. - I know! - Would you rather I said nothing? - You haven't said much anyway. - I'm trying. - To be honest, Mom, I don't really know what you've said. And it's boring and it's pointless and I just wanna go home. - Ask me anything. Josh, I promise I'll answer you. - Don't worry about it. - I promise I'll answer you, Josh. You're pretty much an adult now. You've got a right to know. - Forget it. - You may not get another chance. - Why not? - How often do we do this? - Once is too often. It's not happening again. - Fine. - Why are you such an asshole to Dad all of the time? - That's unfair. - You said you'd answer any question. That's what I wanna know. - Well I don't think I am horrible to him. - You're on his back all the time snipping, "You're late. You're drunk. "Why haven't you taken the bins out?" You go on and on, Mom. - That's not true. - It is true. You know it's true. - It's more complicated than that. - No, it's not. Moan after moan. "Where's the money gone? "Why haven't you put your car in the garage? "Why haven't you changed the shift that you said you would?" - This is everyday life stuff. - You want more examples? Because I've got fucking loads. I'm a bloody expert. - Don't! - You wanted me to talk, Mom. - Not like this. - Three weeks ago he bought you flowers. Don't deny it. - He did. - He came in for Sunday lunch, opened the door and gave you the flowers. And you just threw them in the sink like they were made of shit. - Yes. - You can't be surprised when he's mental at you. - He got them for free, Josh. His mate went to Holland in a van to stock up on tulips, drove back, tried to flog them. Most of them had died. So he couldn't sell them so he gave the rest away for free. - Doesn't matter. - It's the thought that counts. Well your dad had told me this the night before, but he'd been drinking so he couldn't remember. So when he passed them off as a surprise-- - You coulda pretended. - What would have been the point? - We could've had a nice lunch. That would've been good. - He wears me down. I'm exhausted. I'm barely hanging on. - Go to bed early. - I can't remember the last time I slept really well. - We sit around the TV and you're on edge. I can feel it. When there's something interesting on, you ask me what I think. - I do. - But you never ask Dad. - Well he wouldn't be interested. - He might be. - I think I know him better than you do. - He's a clever man. He's not got a lot of examines and hasn't been to university. It's probably just one of all the rest you hate so much. But he's funny and he's intelligent and he takes an interest and you just treat him like he's an idiot. - I don't. - You don't even let him laugh. - Okay, stop now, Josh. I see whose side you're on. - All those old comedies that are on. Only Fools and Horses, he loves that. - I know he does. - Yeah but you tell him to shut up when he laughs. - Oh, that's ridiculous. - You don't even know you're doing it. "You're too loud. Keep it down. "Think of the neighbours." - He's seen them a dozen times before. - Yeah, but he still likes to laugh. Why can't he laugh? - Of course he can laugh. - You tell him off. - I don't. - You do, Mom. You do and if you want me to ask you something, why are you doing that? Why? - We used to laugh all the time. - What's the fucking point of that? You said you were blessed. - I was. I mean it. - But not anymore. He's a bit fat, he's a bit old. He doesn't play in a band anymore. So you grew off him or what? - You don't understand. - Oh god, that's such a fucking parent line. - You are a clever boy. You are seriously clever. God knows where you get it from, but there are things that you don't know. Thinks that you can't know and I've told you, Josh, do not swear at me! - I just wanna know why you hate him so much? - I don't. - You can't stand him, Mom. - You know why. I know sod all. I'm 17 and I don't know fucking anything. But I know one thing. If I was married to you then I would be down at the pub every other night, blowing my wages, because it would be fun and people would laugh and I'd be happy, Mom. Because you wouldn't be there! - Josh! Josh, wait! Wait! Josh! Stop! Josh, stop! - Fuck off! Leave me alone. - Josh, you have to listen to me! - Fuck off! Leave me alone! I don't! - You have to listen to me. - Fuck off. - Listen to me! - Piss off! - You have to listen to me! Listen to me. You know what he's like. - Shut up! - I'm not gonna pretend anymore. - Shut up! - I know he's your dad and you love him, but he is a bad man. - You said you loved him. - I did. I loved everything about him. - Just say, sorry. - He is a bad man. - No, you're a bad wife! - I'm not a bad wife. Every time I go to the cash machine. - Shut up! You're a liar! - Every time I go to the cash machine, he comes with me every time. That's how much he trusts me. - So what? - He opens all notes. He reads all my emails. - So? - You've seen him. You've seen him take the phone out of my hand. You've seen him do that. He grabs the phone out of my hand. You've seen him do that. Hundreds of times. And he doesn't even hide that anymore. - Of course he trusts you. - He does not trust me. We used to go out, do you remember? We used to go out. Do you remember when Jenny used to babysit or your gramme? We used to go out and he used to accuse me of chatting up his mates. - You probably were. - No. It was never me. It was never me, Josh. It was always him. It was in his head. - Shut up. - It was in his head. - Shut up! Shut up! - He called me a slut. - Fuck off! - He called me a whore! - Fuck off! - He hit me, Josh! He started to hit me. - No. - My husband, my lover. - Fucking liar! - And he hit me. He hit me and he still does. - No he doesn't, shut up! - He does! Look! Look! LooK! Look! This is with his fists. He did this last night. - No. - This here is with a broken cup. He never touches my face. He never touches my arms. Only my body. I am so sorry. I'm so sorry. It breaks my heart. - You're a fucking liar. - I know how much I love him, but I can't carry on and you need to know why. - How could you let him? How could you let him do this? - I was terrified. - Pick up the fucking phone. - I should've done. I should've. - Should've been me. - No. No, no, no, no. No, you listen to me. Listen to me, Josh. This was never your fault. You could not have done anything. - I coulda stopped it. - No. No. - You needed me to stop it. - Listen to me! - Listen! Listen! This is not your fault. - Fucking hell! Fuck! - Sorry, do you mind if I borrow this? - Please. - Thanks very much. Thanks again. - No problem. It's three o'clock. Shall I drive you to football? - No. I'm all right. - You sure? I don't mind. - I don't wanna go to football. - Okay. It's not a problem. Shall we go? - Why? - I have no idea. Oh no. There's something wrong with the car. What? - God. I need to find somewhere to pull over. Damn. Shit. Great. Josh, it's a flat tyre. - Yeah. - Do you know how to change a wheel? - I've never tried. - Oh. Looks like we're walking. Do you think anyone will stop? I wonder if there's somebody down there who can help. Do you know what you're doing? - I've no idea. - Can I help? - No, that's fine. - Let me. - Mom, Mom. It's fine. - Okay, I'll go down the road and see if I can get some reception, okay? - Yeah. Fuck. - Wow! Well done. Well done. That's really good. You all right? - Hello. Hello again. You all right? Do you need some help? We're fine I think. - Thought it was you when I was going passed. Not that I wouldn't have stopped to help a stranger. Maybe I wouldn't. Got am I at to be a terrible person. - Thanks for stopping. - No problem. Looks like you've got it all sorted though. - Well yeah, he's doing a great job. - You're right. - Hey, you're a very useful chap, Josh. - He is. - Hang on there, Josh. Only do them up loosely when they're on the jack. Tighten it properly when it's on the ground. - Right. - Otherwise, the nuts can come loose. Well played, Josh. When I was 17 I couldn't even change my trousers. Okay? - It was a joke. Just tighten the nuts up and you're all done. - Thanks. - Not a bit of a problem. Not the best end to the day, aye? - No harm done. - Indeed. Did you have a good afternoon with your boy? - Yes. - Good. Excellent. Well done. Looks like Lewis Hamilton's finished. Well done, Josh. Bethan, we're practically at my house. It's just down the road. You sure you won't come in for a drink? You deserve it. - Honestly, thanks, but it's getting late and we've still got things to do. - You sure? You're not just being polite? Your mom always this polite, Josh? - Not to me. - Good answer. - It's a lovely offer, thank you, but another time. - Of course. I won't force you. That would be a little bit mad or probably illegal. Well thanks again for stopping. - Anytime. You have a good night. You too. - And well done again, Josh. - It was only a tyre. - It really was something, though. Imagine Sophie doing anything remotely as useful. - Maybe not. - Exactly. You have a good night, both of you. Okay, bye. - Bye. Josh, you know where we are if you change your mind. Don't be scared. We're relatively harmless. - Bye. - Bye. - Okay? - Yeah. - Excellent. It stayed on. Excellent work on the wheel. - It's a temporary one. You'll need a garage. - But still. - We should go. - Where? - Sophie's. The barbecue. - We can't go to a party, Josh. - It's not a party, it's a barbecue. - We can't go to a barbecue then. - Why not? - Because I'm not in the mood for small talk and we don't know anybody. - I know Sophie and you now Mrs. Roberts now and she's pretty chatty. You wouldn't have to say much. - I don't think so, Josh. - Look, I don't wanna go home and I don't think you should go home. - It'll be fine. You go to Sam's, okay? That would be best and I'll go home. - No way, Mom. I'm not letting you go home on your own. - It'll be fine, Josh. - No, it won't be fine. It's not fine. If you're going home, I'm going with you. Mom. - Okay. I'll go to the barbecue. Might be fun. - Joshy! I'm so glad that you're hear. Mom said that she met you. - Hi. This is my mom. - Bethan. - Hi! Do you wanna drink? Beer? - Okay, thanks. - You? - Yeah. - Listen, Mom's just over there having the band set up. But she'll be with you in a sec. I've gotta get going because I've got work, but I'll catch up with you later? Have fun. - This is quite big. Slow down. I mean it. - Josh, Bethan, you made it. Fantastic to see you. - I'm sorry we're not more dressed up. - What are you talking about? It's really not that kind of party. Don't move. Sam. Found something for you. - Thank you very much. - Anywhere, you're here. That's brilliant. It's gonna be a good night. - When you said barbecue. - What? I have a barbecue. I have a husband in an apron tending to it. You know Phil, don't you Josh? Have you burnt anything yet Heston? He's a terrible cook. Anyway, listen, help yourself to anything you want. Grab Sophie if you wanna drink. Have fun. The music's gonna be great. All right. - Hey, Joshy. Fancy giving me a hand? - Go on. - What's the pay like? - Terrible, but you get free booze. - Sounds good. - Take that to the harry one over there and I'll see you in the kitchen. - She loves maps. - Maps? - Loves them. Sits there, traces her finger along the roads. It's kinda sweet. - That was her birthday present? - I got her this one of Italy before it became Italy on Ebay. - I bet she loved it. - She did but apparently I paid to much for it. A little bit of spice there then that could be a hot plate. - It's nice and quiet back here. - Is there any meat on the barbecue? - I'm not sure. I've avoided the food so far. - I saw some clam put in corset on their earlier. - That's not what I call a job, really. It's not like a proper job. I can put on my CV because I'm not properly mobile. You know, I'm trying to get different work experience and it's harder when women get older in the workplace. You know, Phil. You know what I'm talking about. - You all right? Enjoy the barbecue. Really nice to see you. Okay, Phil. Guys, is it okay if I do a thing? - Yeah, absolutely. - Oh shit. Lovely. Is it on? It is on? Hello? Can you hear me? Evening all. Thanks very much for coming. It's lovely to see you. Has everyone got a drink? Yeah! - Great, okay. Make sure you grab one of Gordon Ramsay's sausages over there. Oh god, Jeff, not so early. Three cheers for dodgy euphemism, aye! I'm joking. I'm joking. Listen, a little bit of housekeeping. No, bare with me. No flip flops, even flip flops, shoes, anything like that in the house if that's okay. Skids. And also-- Remember what happened to Sandra? Also, gentlemen, we have only the one toilet. If we can leave that for the ladies, that would be fantastic. Please feel free to pee in the bush. But don't mud on the bundiya. It doesn't like it, historically. There we go. I think that's about it. Just really enjoy yourselves. Listen, it's a bit early, but we'll annoy the neighbours again if we're too loud later, so let's crack on with some music. Yeah. They were so good last time, but we've asked them back. To be honest, I think they're glad of the booking. Anyway, here we go. Please welcome Sam Green and the Midnight Heist. Put your hands together. Take it away. Is that good? - Thanks you very much. ♫ My dear, you said a penny for a song ♫ Oh call me shilling Charlie going down ♫ She tells him, sir your words have touched ♫ On all my inclination ♫ I've been running on for two or three years now ♫ Well I work a job upon a 13th floor ♫ And I started anything to survive ♫ My dear, he said, ♫ these streets are not the place for conversation ♫ There's a coffee house and oh let's go inside ♫ She tells him how her house is made of stone ♫ And a kitchen with no overlooks apart ♫ A city of temptation ♫ Passive sophistication ♫ The fruits are even flowering in her yard ♫ She's been changing ♫ She's been changing her mind ♫ Rearranging ♫ She's been making plans to leave it all behind ♫ My dad said I know just what you mean ♫ In my own way I feel a lot like you ♫ Years go by of lately ♫ Seen our world in preparation ♫ Living up to someone's point of view ♫ Now don't you get me wrong ♫ I'm overjoyed ♫ You and I reflect on all the good I have ♫ We secretly, in honesty, ♫ I'm looking for someone, you see ♫ A penny's in a jar from our love song ♫ A penny in a jar for our love song ♫ Cause I been changing ♫ I been changing my mind ♫ Rearranging ♫ I been making plans to leave it all behind ♫ I been changing ♫ I been changing my mind ♫ Been rearranging ♫ I've been making plans to leave it all behind ♫ Yes, I been making plans to leave it all behind ♫ Oh I been making plans to leave it all behind ♫ - Sophie. - I know, but she's always good to you. - She's a gorgeous girl. She's my girl. - What'll you do? - She'll be fine. Remember what you were like? - Yeah, exactly. That's why I'm worried. - Exactly. Well, you just have to close your eyes and pretends it's not happening and you'll be fine. Your mom seems cool. - Not as cool as yours. - She just wishes she was our age. That's all it is. - She seems fun though. - You still with Alex? - Who is a girl? - What? - Nothing, it's just what Sam says. - Right. - All of those ones. - Yeah. - But the second one. - Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom? - Yeah. - Which, of course, chronologically takes place two years before Raiders of the Lost Ark. - Oh. - So that's interesting. - That they didn't shoot it. - They shot it afterwards. They didn't go back in time. It was like 1984. - So what do you reckon? - About what? - About mediaeval Welsh poetry. - Dafydd Llwyd ap Llywelyn ap Gruffudd? - Fuck off. - What? He lived until he was 90, you know? - How do you know that? I was trying to... Forget it. - That was good. "I'll get you, you one-armed man." That was The Fugitive, wasn't it? With Tommy Lee Jones. He jumped out of a tunnel thing. - That's it. - Have you seen Patriot Games? - No. - There's this really good bit in that where he just acts with his back. He's just watching all this terrorism thing going on and he turns and he acts with his back. Very good. I've not seen that before. He's just a very talented actor, I think. - I thought you might like a snog. - It's been a long day. - What's that got to do with it? - You know what, I'll get back to you. - Bastard! - I'll be back in a minute. - All right, then. - My new friend. - Hello. - You having fun? - Yes. Lots. - They're all right, my friends. Aren't they? Some of them. - They're lovely. - You need a drink. - No thanks, I've got to drive us home. - Taxi. - No, I'm fine. - Taxi. - No, honestly, I'm good. - Taxi. - Are you just gonna say taxi until I agree? - No. Taxi. Josh? Your mom's having a really good time. - Yeah. But she needs a few more drinks. - Sure. - I know everything, Josh. Remember that. - I'll try. - You and her are going to get a taxi home later and we'll sort the car out in the morning. - Sounds like a plan. - Yeah, it is a plan, Josh, and a bloody good one. Bugger off somewhere else. There's a good lad. Lovely. - You okay? - Would you like some beer? - Okay, I'll have a very small beer. - Want this one? No, I'll get you a fresh one. - I'll have a fresh one. - I'll get Sophie. Sophie. Sophie? Sophie? I say he's a wanker. He's a tosser. - Why do you think he's a tosser? - He's just a tosser. He's not a wanker, he's a tosser. I'm not a tosser. I'm a wanker. - It's the same thing, isn't it? - I'm a bit of a dick. Definitely not a wanker. Prick? What do you reckon you are? - I don't know. - Like the band? - Yeah? - Mumford and Sons. Nice lads. - Yeah. - They're tossers. - Do you reckon? - What do you reckon you are? Wanker, fucker, tit or asshole? - I don't know. I hadn't thought about that. - Asshole. - How do you reckon? - You're an asshole. - You reckon I'm an asshole. - Simple as that. - Why do you think I'm an asshole for? - You're a tosser. - You're angry. What're you angry about? - I'm not angry. I'm just saying you're a bit of a tosser. - Don't be rude. - I'm a bit of a prick. You're a bit of a tosser. - I'm not. Nick's all right as well. Leave him alone. - Nick's a fucker. You're a tosser. - Shut up. You having a good time? - It's all right. - Yeah, it's all right. You are fucking grumpy tonight. - All right. - Joshy. - What you doing? - You're being so loud. - Josh, take her inside. Give her some water. She'll be fine. Do you want a hand? - No, I'm all right. Come on. - I wanna listen to the music. No. Sophie. - Is that the earliest you can do? That's okay then. Thanks. Bye. - I don't sleep in this bedroom. - Yeah, you are tonight. - Joshy. Joshy. Joshy, I wanna kiss. That's nice. - Night, Soph. - Night, Joshy. Did you have fun? Yeah. - I had fun. Is Sophie all right? - She's used to it. - Let's go to the beach. - What about the taxi? - It could be ages. Half hour. - I'll wait. - Okay. Won't be long. Just down to the beach and back. - Mom? - Yeah? - Where are we going tonight? - To Cath's. We can let ourselves in. She won't mind. - You texted her? - Yeah. I phoned her from the party. - She's okay? - Yeah. Spare room's made up and I can stay on the sofa. It's okay. - You're not gonna change your mind? - About going home? - Yeah. - Do you want me to? - No. - Good. I thought you were waiting for the taxi? - I got bored. - You used to have to wait for hours for a taxi on a Friday night. - Yeah. - Josh, you know everything's gonna change now, don't you? - Yeah. - That's good. That's okay. - Yes. - Scary too. I've been frightened for a long time. - I know. - Not anymore. - No. I'm glad. - I love you, Josh. - Yeah. It's been a weird day. - But good though, right? There are no straight lines, Josh. When you're young that's what you think life is. One long, straight line that you do your best to follow. And you think everyone's doing a better job at following it than you are. Then you realise the line isn't straight. It curves and it twists and often it isn't a line at all. It's more like all of those paintings you did when you were little, before you could write. A big mess of colours and shapes that seem to start and end without reason. There is no path. It's just noise. Emergency service. Hello, what service do you require?
