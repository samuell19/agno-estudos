(gentle music) (upbeat music) - The 1966 Ford Mustang convertible. Candy apple red, 289 motor with an automatic transmission, one of the most sought after classic cars of all time. The Mustang came out with this body style in 1964 and a half, and it's called a 64 and a half because they didn't start releasing it until the middle of the year. Then they made it for two more years, until 1967 when it started to look more like a hot rod. My parents have always known that I've wanted a classic 66 Mustang. It's my dream, my passion, the car that I've always dreamt about owning. This is like one of the cars you see in the movies. - Wow. - Come on, let's sit in it. (upbeat music) (car door opens) (upbeat music) (car door closes) - Look at the window mechanisms. You have to roll it up with your hand because it's not electric. - Do you know how cool this is gonna be, when we take this to school on Monday? The last day of school, and we are going to go out in style. - Are you kidding me? We're gonna be the coolest girls in school. - I can't believe my parents bought this for me. I mean, this is like a dream come true. Now, we don't have to take the bus to band practice anymore. - Guys might actually notice us with this car. (upbeat music) - Okay, get ready for this, it's a big surprise. Don't look, don't look, don't look, and... Alex. What the hell are you doing in this car? Out. Out now, get out. What are you doing? This is not your car. - Is this is really your car? - This is really your car. Okay, so sorry about this. It really wasn't supposed to go down like this. You, young lady, have no right to be sitting in his car. He worked for it. You did not work for it. You are still in school. And you've gotta get to music class, do you not? Yeah, yeah. - Thanks mom and dad. - We're so proud of you, son. - You deserve it, you worked for it and you earned every bit of it. And that's the whole point. You're gonna get to roll up as a freshman in this beautiful bomb ass candy apple red Mustang, which I wish that I had. Believe me, I wish I had when I was your age. - But you didn't, you had a Volkswagen. But that's the reason why I married you. - You got that right dear. And that's why, you're so cute. I love you. I love you. But you young lady, you have got some work to do. Do you understand? This is how it works, it's a little quid pro quo, okay? So you do the work, you get good grades, and then you get a bonus round, you see? So now let's stop talking about all this and get your butt to class because you guys are both late for band practice. So hip hop, hip hop, let's go, come on. Band practice, we gotta get going. You guys in the car. Gotta get down to the state inspection session and you guys have got to get outta here. Go, go, go, go, go. Girls, enjoy the bus. (car door closes) (car engine revving) (upbeat music) I drove here, by the way too, so I know what I'm doing. (upbeat music) - I'm gonna have a car like that one day, you wait. - Then maybe we could be cool for once in our lives. - Come on, let's go grab our backpacks and get to band practice. (upbeat music) Good morning, Mr. Peterson. - Morning. - Thank you for the ride, we'd be walking without you. - Anytime. (upbeat music) - I'm trying out for drum major. - Really? You don't get enough music from playing your trombone? And now you wanna conduct it? Let's not forget about the endless band tapes you watch. - It's a really good position for me. - I think I'm gonna try out for section leader. - Hey Claire. I heard you were trying out for drum major this year. - Maybe. - Hey, don't worry, your gonna do fine. I'll practice with you over the summer before I go off to college. That way the seniors don't beat you out. - Thanks, Larry. - Hey, don't worry. Being in the band is like being in a family, right Alex? - Right. - And family sticks together no matter how hard it gets. (upbeat music) - I wish all guys would talk to me like that, outside of the band I mean. (upbeat music) (bus engine revving) (upbeat music) (whistle blowing) (upbeat music) (wind whooshing) (upbeat music) (trombone playing) Oh, so what are your parents doing this weekend? - They're taking my brother to see his new college. - Where's that? - College Station. They're taking him to get acquainted with the school and then they're looking at dorms. (gentle music) - [Coach] Drive here. - Hey, check it out. Randy's checking you out. (whistle blows) (gentle music) - Hey Randy! - Ruby! (gentle music) - What are you two band geeks looking at? - We were watching the football practice. - You sure you weren't looking at my man, Randy? - No, we were waiting for the football team to clear the field so we could practice our band steps. That's what band kids do. - You think you're real cool, huh, band geek? (gentle music) Bet your mother doesn't know that you two still play with Barbie's. (mean girls laughing) - Don't make mom jokes around Claire. - Why not band geek? - Because her mom isn't around anymore. - I'm a momma's girl, I'm a momma's girl. I'm a momma's girl. (mean girls laugh) - Leave us alone, Ruby. - Or else what? (team chattering) (gentle music) (hand pushing) (girls falling) (mean girls laugh) - Losers. - Band nerds. Band nerds. - I'm tired of getting picked on by those three girls. - What do you expect? We're dorks and we will always be dorks. - One day, I'm gonna stand up to Ruby, drive the coolest car in school and ask Randy out on a date. - Keep dreaming. Besides, when do girls ask boys out on dates? - I'm gonna change that. Come on, let's go to driver's ed. (bell ringing) - You will get a ticket if you do not turn off your signal light. - Thanks Mr. Gleason. (books dropping) (gentle music) Thanks. - This is a classroom, not a romantic adventure. Ladies, take your seats. (metal clanking) As I was saying, tomorrow is your final examination. It best behooves you to remember what was taught in this class if you wish to pass that examination. Which begs the question, at the end of the day, who will be a winner and who will be a loser? Since tomorrow is the final examination. Today will consist of an oral pop quiz. First question. When is it improper to make a right turn on a red light? - Hi, sweetie. - Mom, tomorrow's my big day. - I know my little one's finally taking her driving test. - I can't wait to get my license. (phone rings) (water splashing) Oh, I have to take this. - Guess what? - What? - Randy and Zach are gonna be hanging out at the Pig Stand tonight. - How do you know? - Well, I overheard them talking on my way to the nurse's office for my checkup. - You know there's nothing wrong with you, right? Your dad is just paranoid. - I know, but-- - Your mom passing away has nothing to do with what you're feeling. Cancer isn't something you can catch, it just happens to people. - Yeah, I know. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I was out of line for saying that. - That's okay. - I'll meet you at the Pig Stand in an hour? - [Claire] Yeah, I'll see you later, bye. (gentle music) (car engine revving) (gentle music) (footsteps thudding) (gentle music) (door opens) (footsteps thudding) (gentle music) You hear that? - It's my favorite song, Clair de Lune. (gentle music) - Hey dude, we don't wanna look like band dorks, let's go inside. (door opens) (crowd chattering) (gentle music) - I really screwed up during band practice today. - Why, what happened? - Well, nothing really, but Mr. Robinson just got really mad at me. - Was it hot? You don't do well under heat. - Yeah, I know, but it really isn't an excuse, you know? - Right. - Do you see that? - Yes, I do. - Wouldn't it be cool if you got a chance to invite this guys to a party? - I could show them my band tapes. - No, I mean real music, like what other people listen to. - I listen to real music. - I mean what cool people listen to. - Oh. - Just one time, done. - Y'all going to that game next week? We're gonna go against Church House this year and we're gonna beat 'em with our new star quarterback, Randy. (gentle music) (boys laughing) - I hope you are ready for this. I don't want a driver on the road who cannot operate a motor vehicle properly. - Yes, sir. (car engine revving) - You know the procedure is, you take your foot off the gas, you put it on the brake, you put the car in gear, you put your foot on the gas, and we go. - Oh yeah, I was only testing you. - Yeah, right. (car engine revving) - Well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex from band class. - Oh no. - The champion of the racing squad versus the band geek and our little driver's, ed buddy. Victory, victory it is when we kick your butt. (dramatic music) (car engine revving) (dramatic music) (car engine revving) - Think you can beat me? - Let's go. - Come on band loser, we're gonna take you down. - Don't even think about it, if you wish to pass this examination. - Band nerds - Later loser. (tires squealing) See ya. (car engine revving) (upbeat music) - Do you think you passed the test? - I hope so. I prayed and studied for it all night long. - I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. (crowd laughing) (gentle music) - Did you see that? I did it, I passed. - Congratulations. Now we can go places. (gentle music) - Wow. Look at Zach. He looks so hot. - Look at Randy. He's so cute. - I wish we just had one chance to talk to those guys. (crowd chattering) - Maybe we do. Now that I got my license, maybe we have that chance. I'm gonna ask Randy out on a date. (gentle music) Oh. - No way, not unless you wanna get beaten up by our favorite bully friend. - We'll see. - I love my family. I think about how lucky I am when I start comparing my family to every other family out there. And you know, you see it. You see it when you go to the big, you know, class reunions and you see the people that are your own age and what they've done with their families. And then I go and I visit your school and I watch other parents. I think we've done very well with our children, don't you? - Yes, dear. - So since I passed my driver's test, do you guys think you can buy me a car like you did for Bart? - The answer is you will have a car, but your first car is gonna be the same as his first car. (gentle music) - You're kidding, right? The van? - Yeah. Why? - It's been parked in the garage, it probably doesn't even work. - Yes it does. - I will look like a complete dork in the van. - You already look like an incomplete dork. - Shut up. - Be nice, be nice. Listen, so Bart, why don't you go ahead and get your stuff and grab everything. Get everything together, and wait put your book money away because you're not gonna need to bring it with you. I've decided to pay for everything this weekend. I'd rather that you hold onto it. - So what about me? - You are going to be staying here because you can't afford to miss drum line practice on Saturday morning. - I'm staying here all by myself? - Not by yourself, I've made all the arrangements. I already went ahead and I called Claire's dad and I set everything up and he's totally fine with her coming over for the weekend. So you're gonna spend a nice, lovely weekend with Claire and you guys, I'm sure will have a great time. All I ask is that you're responsible and you don't do anything I wouldn't do. Speaking of which, we need to start getting everything out to the SUV so that we can be packed and ready to go. - So you are not taking the Mustang? - No, no. I know exactly how your mind's working right now. Don't get any big ideas. I'm telling you the Mustang stays where it is, okay? - Okay. (upbeat music) I can't believe my parents bought my brother a cool Mustang and I got stuck with his old van. - Well, at least you have a car. - Well, other kids don't get stuck with this problem. How am I supposed to get a boyfriend? My first wheels have to be cool. (upbeat music) - Hey look. - Why didn't you come over last night? Are you seeing someone else? You better not. - What's going on with you? I'm at practice. Are you really doing this right now? - [Ruby] You haven't been spending time with me. - That girl's mean. - [Ruby] It's always - [Ruby] about the boys. - Tell me about it. - [Randy] Can you just, - [Ruby] it's about me. - One day we're gonna kick that girl's butt. - Can you just gimme some space? - Space? You're not gonna get any space. - Now's your chance, go. Go. - You're not talking. - What do you expect me to do? - Don't give me an attitude. - God, dude, just go away. - No. - Just leave. - You know what, fine. - They're about to yell at me. - You know what-- - Excuse me. - What do you want band geek? What do you think you're doing in my business? - I think you should stop yelling at Randy. (suspenseful music) - I don't like to be touched band geek. But I'll let it slide just this once. If I catch you talking or even looking at my boyfriend, Randy, me and two my friends here, we're gonna rearrange your face. And same goes for your little band friend too. - Hey, break it up. You three my office, now. - [Crowd] Ooh. - Now. - You better watch your back, I'm watching you. (girls laughing) (gentle music) - [Claire] Ahhh, that was intense. - We better watch it because Ruby is gonna kick our butts. - I don't care. I tried my best to get Randy's attention and I know he noticed me today. - Yes you did. And did you see Zach's cute face? - Settle down, Claire. If we're gonna get boys to notice us at school, we need a car. - You're not thinking what I think you're thinking. - We're gonna take my brother's 1966 Ford Mustang to the Pig Stand tonight. - Why, you're crazy, Alex. - My parents are 300 miles away. Taking my brother to see his new college dorm room. Do I look crazy? (gentle music) They'll never find out. - This is not a good idea. But if I get to see Zach's cute face again, then maybe it'll be good. - I know where my brother left his keys.

(girls giggling) - Hey Alex, I heard you stepped it up to Ruby and her bully friends. - Something like that. (upbeat music) (girls giggling) (upbeat music) Can you believe that guy just called me hot? - Well, he said, "That's so hot." But. - Either way, people are paying attention to us in this car. - The car can change your life. - Though I was thinking of maybe throwing a house party tomorrow night. - Really? - Yeah. - No, no way. It's just no one's gonna show up to a party at your house and not cool people anyway. - Well, you can invite the band kids and I'll invite Randy. - Please tell me you're gonna invite Zach too. (upbeat music) - Randy. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? - I mean, it's Friday, so, pretty good. - Yeah, me too. I mean, since it's Friday, I mean. - So I heard you got a new car, candy apple red Mustang convertible. - Yeah, I just got it. It's parked outside. - You know that's really cool. - Do you and your friends wanna go to a house party tomorrow night? - Who's party? - Mine. - You're doing it. - As long as you're picking me up in that sweet new car of yours. - Yeah, of course. - Do you know where I live though? - Everyone knows where you live. I'll see you at 7:30. - Yeah. Cool. - I thought I told you not to talk to my boyfriend band geek! You know I'm getting pretty sick and tired of seeing you walk around school thinking you're some kind of hero. - I don't think that. - Hey, Ruby. (water splashing) - [Mean Girls] Oh. (upbeat music) - Get off me, get those girls. (upbeat music) (car door closes) (car engine revving) (upbeat music) (tires screeching) - Oh. What a babe. - Did you see Ruby's face when I threw water at her? - She was so pissed, I can't believe we just did that. (car engine revving) (upbeat music) (tires screeching) (car engine revving) (upbeat music) - Don't look now but Ruby's on our tail. (tires screeching) - Oh man, we have to lose them. (car engine revving) - You can't escape me. (car engine revving) I'm gonna get you band geeks. (car engine revving) - Look out. (tires screeching) - What the hell? - You, what the hell damn kids? - Get out of the way old man. - What the heck? - Move. - Damn it. - Where'd she even get that 1966 Ford Mustang? - I don't know. - Well, we're gonna find out. - Where did you learn how to drive like that? - I used to play R.C. Pro-Am with my brother when we were kids. I guess I just remember the tricks to racing. (Claire squealing) - I've never felt so free. - We just pumped the baddest girls in school. They're probably gonna steal my lunch money for the next two years. - It's okay, it was worth it. (Claire chuckles) - Yeah, you're right. Let's go home. (car engine revving) (gentle music) - Ruby was so pissed today. - Yeah, it was so funny to see her get so angry and there was nothing she could do about it. - We took off like lightning and they couldn't even catch us. - Can I tell you something? - Sure, you can tell me anything. - I just wanted to let you know that I think of you like a big sister. (gentle music) - Thanks, Claire. - It's just, I don't really have a big sister and after my mom passed away, it's just me and my brother and my dad. And my dad's always working, so. - Well, that's what parents do. They work hard to protect us and here we are screwing around. (both chuckle) (gentle music) - I just wish that my mom could see me be in marching band, especially if I get drum major. I mean, who knows? Maybe we could be in UIL this year. (gentle music) - Your mom is watching you from heaven. I know that. (gentle music) - Do you think maybe I could have a chance with Zach? I mean maybe he might like me. - I hope so. We're both trying to get the hottest guys in school. (gentle music) (alarm beeping) (gentle music) (toothbrush brushing) Do you want some coffee? - Sure. - Oh, do you want creamer? - No, thank you. (cup thudding) - Okay, so the plan is, I need to wash the car and then we need to clean up this house and find some alcoholic beverages for tonight. - Do you know where you're gonna wear tonight? - I was thinking my overalls. - No, no, not about it. (both laugh) (hose spraying) (metal clanking) (water splashing) (upbeat music) I can't believe you skipped out on drum line practice today. We've got that big competition coming up and I've got lessons for sectionals. - Relax Claire, we have a candy apple red, 1966 Ford Mustang and we only have it until tomorrow. So we have to drive this baby as much as we can so we can enjoy it tonight. - I guess you're right. - Besides, I'm picking up Randy tonight and he's going out with me. Me. - I guess I will go pick up the house while you take him out. - Oh, don't start pulling up my mom's party stuff. - [Claire] I won't. - That's stuff for kids parties. Start calling our friends and see who wants to hang out for the party. - We don't have any friends. - Well just invite everyone you can think of. Invite the band kids if you have to. Just invite whoever you can so it makes it look like we're not losers. Oh, and we need beer. (coins jingling) - Is that all? - Well, my mom left me $20. - I guess we're just gonna have to buy a bunch of cheap 12 packs. (coins jingling) - Let's go to the convenience store. (gentle music) Are the tires low? - I don't know, never owned a car. - Do you think they're gonna let me get beer? - I don't know, but you can try. - Okay, you wait here. I'm gonna go try inside. (upbeat music) (car engine revving) (upbeat music) - All right girls, it's time to look pretty. - Excuse me, sir, do you mind if I use your restroom? - Sure, it's over that way. (upbeat music) - Oh, sorry. (upbeat music) - What do you think of our little band geek Alex throwing a party tonight? - I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We're gonna crash her little band party tonight. (girls laughing) - Oh no. (girls laughing) - Let's go. Let's see if Kelly scored the beer. (tissue rustling) (car door opens) Atta girl Kelly. (upbeat music) (car door closes) (door opens) (upbeat music) (tires screeching) (upbeat music) - Good afternoon, officer. Is there something I can help you with? - As a matter of fact, there is, I got a call about a little girl asking adults to buy alcohol for her. - I don't know what you're talking about. I just went inside to use the restroom and then these girls came into the bathroom and they scared me-- - Do you have a driver's license, young lady? - Yes. Yes I do. - Well, may I see it? (footsteps thudding) (birds chirping) - I don't have it. - Of course you don't. This is the type of behavior that can lead you to more trouble. I was a kid like you once too, and you don't seem like bad kids and you haven't been arrested, right? - No sir. - Well, unfortunately I can't let you drive this vehicle without a driver's license. So I've decided to take it to the pound. - But officer. - You want to get it back? Just show us your driver's license and pay the fee for the towing. - All right, officer. I admit we broke the law and we are so sorry. It's my fault. I forgot Alex's purse at home and it won't ever happen again. However, we need this car so that my silly friend over there can take the boy of her dreams out on a date. (upbeat music) - I guess we walk. (upbeat music) (tires squealing) - Hey losers! - Are you thirsty? (water splashing) - Stay away from my man, Randy! (tires squealing) (upbeat music) - [News Anchor] Congratulations-- - So what are we gonna do now? - [News Anchor] Students. Now, come on down to. Fast-- - Let me think. - [News Anchor] Half price college books where today. - I don't know. - [News Anchor] And maybe tomorrow. - Well at least we found your purse. - Yeah. - What are you waiting for? You snooze, you lose. Hop in your jalopy, step on the gas and get on down here to Fast Draw McGraw's, half price college books. Yeah, you, I'm talking to you. - Half priced books. My brother's piggy bank. (suspenseful music) I've got the solution to my problem. Remember, you're doing this to get Bart's car out of the police pound. (upbeat music) - Wooo (throat clearing) Alex. - Yeah, I'm here to pick up my car. (upbeat music) Did you contact anyone about the party? - Yeah, I've got a few people from band coming over and some of my brother's friends. - Wait, your brother's coming? - I told him we'd give him 50 bucks if he got his alcohol with his fake ID. - And he agreed. - Yes. - Great. Let's do that, we're running out of time. (upbeat music) (shower running) - Are you sure we should have this party? - We have to have this party. - Then what if Ruby and her friend show up? - Look, you've always wanted to be cool, right? Well, now is your chance. And you're the one who's always complaining about not being in the cool crew. - Okay. But. - Okay, tonight is the night, I'm picking up the hottest guy in school with the coolest 1966 Ford Mustang. When is this ever going to happen again? Let's live a little bit, besides you have to help me make this night special. - Okay, everything's gonna be fine. - Talk to you when you get out of the shower. (shower curtain ruffling) (gentle music) (spectacles clanking) (gentle music) (metal clanking) (bottle spraying) (gentle music) - Are you going to be wearing any makeup? - Yeah, of course. - I don't really know how to do makeup. So do you think maybe you could help me out? - Of course I can. - Be careful. - I'm not gonna hurt your eye. Here, close your eye, it'll I'll make it easier for me to put it on. - Okay? - I like a more natural look. The girls at school like to be made up like clowns, but I think it's better when it's simple. - How do you know when it's right? - Well, I like people to think that I'm not actually wearing makeup so they think I have natural beauty. (gentle music) - Okay, now look up. This will make your eyelashes look longer and darker. (Alex chuckles) - My mother wasn't around to teach me this sort of thing, so I mainly learned from watching TV. - I think you do a great job. I'm just adding a few touch ups. (gentle music) - Thank you for being my friend. I don't have many and well, you always stick around through the hard times. - Well, that's what friends are for. They get you through everything. My grandma said that friends come and go, but true friends will stick with you in the end. - Oh, that is my brother. Can I take the money from your brother's piggy bank? - Mhm. - Okay. (car honking) (upbeat music) (car door closes) (upbeat music) - Hello brother. - Here you go. - Here's your money. - I'm only doing this so that you and Alex can try to be cool for once. Don't get into trouble. Love you. Bye. - Bye. Thanks for the beer. (footsteps thudding) - What do you think? - You look good. Randy's gonna be really impressed. - Thanks Claire. - I'm gonna take Randy to get something to eat really quick and then I'll be back. - Take care of my house. - See you later. (upbeat music) (car engine revving) (upbeat music) (car engine revving) (upbeat music) (car door closes) (footsteps thudding) - Right on time. (footsteps thudding) (door knocking) (upbeat music) (door opens) - Can I help you young lady? - I'm here to pick up Randy for our date. - Wait don't I know you? - I live right down the street. - Yeah, but you're the drum line captain, aren't you? - Kind of. - I knew I remembered you. Fred, come here for a second. (upbeat music) (footsteps thudding) You remember Bonnie's little daughter? - Oh yes. You've grown up. - She sure has, hasn't she? - Hey, is that your candy apple red, 1966 Ford Mustang Convertible. - Mm. - I always wanted one of those. - It's gorgeous. - Alex. Hey. I see you've met my parents. - Yeah, they're both very nice. - Mom, we're gonna get outta here. - You all have a good time, okay? - And take care of that Mustang. - Fred. - I mean, take care of my son, Randy. - Will you stop it? He's a grown man, he can handle himself. (upbeat music) (car door closes) (car engine revving) (upbeat music) (car door opens) (car door closes) - I thought we were gonna your house party. - Well, we are, but I thought we should grab something to eat first. - Okay, I told Zach and Kurt to meet us there, so I guess I'll just tell him I'll be a little late. (gentle music) What is this? - Sushi, ever have it before? - Like once. - I thought you were the type of guy who'd know of the different types of sushi. - No, it's actually a real mystery to me. - So how did your friends react when you told them you were going out with me tonight? - I really don't care what my friends think. Kind of used to doing my own thing. - How do you feel about going out with a band girl like me? - It's all right, I guess. I mean, you're at every football game and you're there playing cadences to the football team. - So you listen to the songs we play? - Yeah, of course. I mean, how else am I supposed to get hyped for the game? - I don't know, I just, I figured you didn't know I existed. - Well, I do. And you're like really good at the drums too. - Thank you. I just don't like telling people I play in the band because I don't like to get picked on. - You mean Ruby? Well, we're not really together anymore. I probably shouldn't have been going out with her in the first place. I started to realize she's just a bully and I'm just now seeing that. We've been together since like sophomore year and things were good at first, she was nice, but she's just gotten more and more aggressive and I'm just now starting to open up my eyes and see how she treats people. (gentle music) - Can I tell you something? I admire your adult decision to break up with Ruby. You're the hottest guy in school and you don't deserve to be treated like that. (crowd chattering) Well, thank you for coming out with me tonight. The girls in the band will never believe that we're out on a date. (upbeat music) (car engine revving) (car door opens) (upbeat music) (car door closes) This isn't much of a party, I'm not really that cool. But you go inside, I'll meet you in there. I'll put the car cover over the car. - Cool. I'll see you in there. (keys jingling) - This is beer pong. Shall we? (upbeat music) (crowd chattering) (upbeat music) - Hey, Randy, Zach and Kurt are over there waiting for you at the table. And don't mind any of the band kids. They just haven't seen anyone as attractive as you. - Right. Thanks. - Zach, what's up man? - Randy, you're finally here, bud. This is a stupid sophomore party, but at least they have cold beer. (upbeat music) (door closes) (crowd chattering) (upbeat music) - I see Claire got you a beer. - Yeah. Thanks Claire. - So Claire's a great host. She's gonna be drum major next year, which means I get to have her play the fight song for me whenever I want. - Drum major, I love a woman who can take charge of a band. Tell me more about it. (upbeat music) - Can I show you something in my room? - Yeah. Let's go. (upbeat music) (crowd chattering) (car engine revving) - Are you sure this is the right address? - It is. I bet that 1966 Mustang is under that car cover over there in the driveway. You girls ready? - Oh, you know it, Ruby. (all laugh) - All right, we're gonna go into the party calmly then we're gonna trash it. (all laugh) All right, let's go scoop this out. (car door opens) (car door closes) (girls giggling) (upbeat music) - Take this. Hey everyone, we brought the goods. - The party has just begun. - Give me that. - Ew, what is this nonsense? - Someone turn that off. - Does anyone know where Alex and Claire are? ♪ So nothing left of you ♪ ♪ Nothing for you ♪ (door opens) - So, this is your room huh? - Yeah. Sorry, it's a little messy. I didn't have time to clean it, it was a long day. - It's fine. Did did you draw that? (gentle music) - Yeah, I did it when I was in love with this boy in the sixth grade. (gentle music) ♪ Funny how things change ♪ ♪ Time will never move ♪ - Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to bother you two. I thought the room was empty. - That's okay, you can use the room next door. Just don't touch any of my brother's stuff. - Thanks Alex, we promise not to make a mess. All right, let's go smoke in this room. - So where were we? - [Claire] Hey, I need to talk to you. - One second. (door opens) Not now, quit bugging me. - What are you talking about? - What's so important that you have to talk about? - Well, I was just gonna tell you that we've ran out of beer. - Can you find something else to do, I'm in the middle of something. Get lost. (gentle music) I'm sorry. - It's good. (crowd chattering) (footsteps thudding) - Get lost losers. Go. (mean girls giggle) (crowd chattering) Well, at least we know her car's still here. - So what do you wanna do with it? - Let's play some music. (mean girl chuckles) (upbeat music) (crowd chattering) (mean girls laugh) (classical music) (mean girls giggling) - Oh, stop. (gentle music) - Or else what? - Why are you guys doing this? - Shut up band geek, you can go back to your room and play your dumb tuba. - It's a trombone. (Claire falling) (bottles clanking) - [Ruby] Wanna be. (mean girls laugh) Dork. (mean girls laughing) - Aw. (upbeat music) - Hey, have you seen Claire? - Last time I saw her she was throwing out the trash, but that was like 30 minutes ago. - Okay, thanks. Hey guys, listen up. Have any you seen Claire? - Nope. - Okay, well I wanted to show you something really special. My new car. I won it in Las Vegas because I'm a really great card player. - Yeah, tell us about it. - Who wants to see it? (upbeat music) (footsteps thudding) (crickets chirping) Okay, everyone, just like I promised, the candy apple red, 1966 Ford Mustang convertible. (crickets chirping) (cover ruffling) - [Crowd] Oh. (crickets chirping) - Claire? What happened to you? - Little Alex. This has been one hell of a night, hasn't it? Look at your friend over there. All tied up like the band geek she is. - Hmm. - Aww. - Why don't you tell all your band friends here how you really got this car? You're just a fake Alex, your little friend told me the whole story. How you never won a bet in Vegas. Matter of fact, you never even been to Vegas. And as for this, candy, apple red, 1966 Ford Mustang convertible. Well, that's not yours either. Why don't you tell your band friends how you really got it and you stole it from your older brother. - [Crowd] Oh, - You've been driving around in a stolen vehicle for the past few days. You are nothing but a band loser. Just like the rest of them. (cricket chirping) Have a good night band loser. (footsteps thudding) - What the hell, Alex? You kicked me out of the room and then these girls beat me up and tied me up and threw me in this car. I thought you had my back. - We gotta go, Randy. We don't need to be around this type of drama. We already got our own. - I'm gonna go ahead and go with the guys. They were talking about finishing the night at the Pig Stand, so. (crickets chirping) (footsteps thudding) (crickets chirping) - I am so so sorry Claire. (gentle music) - When I needed you most, you were off trying to hook up with Randy. (gentle music) (crickets chirping) Help me. (car door opens) (gentle music) (car door closes) - Please forgive me, I just wanted to be cool for once. - And you were. - I just wanted Randy to notice me. - Well at least you got to take him out to dinner. - Yeah, but just like everything else, it doesn't last. One day, none of this will matter. We'll grow up and we'll go to college. And this will just be a memory in my life. A time in my life when I just wanted to feel real, but I don't know if I should be proud or upset. I'm just a stupid band nerd, trying to beat the odds. For once in my life, I just wanted to be the girl that boys look at and think, "Wow, she's got everything together." So I'm sorry if I make mistakes, but I'm just trying to fit in. (gentle music) (crickets chirping) (footsteps thudding) (gentle music) (crickets chirping) (gentle music) (car door opens) (car door closes) (crickets chirping) (gentle music) I really ruined it. (tap running) (crickets chirping) All I wanted, was to have a good time with my best friend in the whole world. I just wanted to show her that she could have a good time for once. I ruined my chance with Randy. I ruined my brother's car and whatever reputation I had left. And now, my best friend in the whole world is mad at me and there's nothing I can do about it. (gentle music) (Claire sobs) (gentle music) (Claire sobs) (gentle music) (Claire sobs) (gentle music) (Alex exhales) (gentle music) (tap running) (gentle music) (crickets chirping) (gentle music) - Alex. (crickets chirping) We can fix this problem before your parents get home. (crickets chirping) - You know what? You're right. (car door opens) (car door closes) I'm tired of Ruby bullying us. I'm not gonna let her bully me anymore and I'm not gonna let her bully you either. Just like Mr. Gleason said, "Who are we going to be at the end of the day? "A winner or a loser?" If we don't make a stand, we're never gonna make a stand. Let's make this one count. I'm not gonna let you leave as a dork. Let's go get Ruby and her friends and let's make this a night to remember. Ruby and her two bully friends messed with the wrong band geeks. (upbeat music) (mean girls laugh) Hey are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. I just tripped on my shoelace. - Okay, let's go. (footsteps thudding) - Look who decided to show up? What you band dorks didn't get enough earlier? Or do we need to kick your butts again? - Ruby. (gentle music) - You're going down band geek. - You think you can pick on me? - You've gone on my last nerve since you got into my business. And now I'm gonna knock your teeth out. - What did I do that was so bad to you? Just like all the other kids at school that you pick on. I'm not the one. And Claire doesn't deserve to be picked on like that. You know, all the mom jokes you make all the time? Well, yeah, she doesn't have a mom. And maybe you do, but not everyone can go home to their mom every night. You know something, I tried to be cool for once I took my brother's car without his permission. And for what? So I can maybe impress the hottest guy at school. It's not easy being a band geek. You have to play songs for the football team, play cadences for the cheerleaders, and show up to band practice all the time. For once in my life I wanted to be cool just like you. And you know what? You are not cool. And I never wanna end up like you and your two bully friends because I like who I am. And I'm going to kick your ass because I'm tired of being pushed around. - I'm gonna rearrange your face band geek. - Good luck trying. - You are not gonna bully me anymore. - Me neither. (suspenseful music) - Ruby, can we just talk this out? Go inside? (dramatic music) (hand punching) - [Crowd] Oh. (crowd chattering) (suspenseful music) (hand punching) (stick dropping) (Alex falling) - [Crowd] Oh. - Come on loser. (Ruby falling) (footsteps thudding) - [Crowd] Fight, fight, fight. (hand punching) (mean girl laughs) - [Ruby] Get off me. (trombone case swinging) (Alex falling) - Want some more? - Let go. - Give me that. - You think you can beat me? Well, you can't. You can lie about your car and try to steal my boyfriend. But you can't fool the rest of the school. What'd you think you were gonna get away with this lie? You're nothing but a band geek. And that's what you will always be. (dramatic music) Who wants to go up against me? (suspenseful music) - [Crowd Member] What? (trombone case swinging) (Claire falling) - Nobody? - Hey Ruby, ready for round two? - I was born ready you little band geek. - Come on then. (hand swinging) - You are nothing but a little loser band geek. - You and your little band geek friend are never gonna be cool. (mean girls laughing) - Let's go see Alex get her butt whipped by Ruby. (suspenseful music) (hand punching) - [Crowd Member] Hit her. - [Crowd] Oh, you got her. Alex, Alex, Alex, Alex. (hand punching) (suspenseful music) - [Crowd Member] Oh no, not a knife. - You never should started this fight Alex. You're gonna lose. It's over for you. - Oh my God, Ruby, what are you doing? - Get off me. - You're taking this too far. - No I'm not, go. - You can't do this, she's been through enough. - I'll tell you when she's had enough. (footsteps thudding) (dramatic music) (hand punching) - [Crowd] Oh. Oh. - [Crowd Member] That looked like it hurt. (dramatic music) - Are you all right? (dramatic music) - You can do this, trust me. (dramatic music) (Alex jumping) - [Crowd Member] Go Alex. Get her. (dramatic music) - [Crowd Member] Get her Alex. (dramatic music) (Ruby falls) (hand tapping) (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) (Ruby coughs) (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - I knew you could do it Alex. (hands clapping) (upbeat music) - I can't believe we did it. We will go down in history as the girls that beat up Ruby and her friends. Do you understand this? We are heroes, girl, heroes. (car engine revving) (crowd cheering) (crowd applauding) (car engine revving) (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - You were pretty brave tonight. - Thank you. - You showed the whole school that you're not afraid of being who you really are. - Well, I was scared, but I had to do what I had to do. I've been bullied my whole life. And without Alex, I wouldn't have been able to stand up to those girls. - Do you think you can teach me to play trombone one day? - I thought you had a girlfriend. - Not after tonight. - I thought you'd never ask. (Zach chuckles) (gentle music) (crickets chirping) (mouth kissing) (crickets chirping) - You know I learned a lot about you tonight. - What, that I'm not completely a dork? - No, I just always thought that the band geeks were like rejects or something. And tonight I think a little different. I don't know, Ruby was always just a bully and somebody had to put her in her place and you are just who you are. Even if you did lie about your car. (Alex chuckles) - Yeah, well I'm gonna pay for that tomorrow and probably never leave my house again. But, it was worth every minute. You were worth every minute to me. I mean that. (crickets chirping) (gentle music) (all laugh) - That was fun. - We're gonna take y'all home. (car door opens) (car engine revving) (car door opens) (car door closes) (gentle music) Thanks for a great night. - Thank you. - Tell your parents I'm sorry for getting you home so late. - I wouldn't worry about it. I mean, I told 'em I was out with the guys anyway, so. - I guess I'm in trouble with them now. - I wouldn't say that. (gentle music) (upbeat music) (car engine revving) (upbeat music) (car door closes) (upbeat music) - I had a really great time last night. - Me too, I loved how you kicked Ruby and her friend's butts. - You better watch it or might kick your butt too. (upbeat music) (Claire chuckles) (upbeat music) (Alex laughs) - Woo. - Woo. (car door closes) (upbeat music) (car engine revving) (car door closes) (keys jingling) - Here, we have to put the cover on the car so we don't have to see it. (trunk closes) (keys jingling) It's gonna be a great summer. - Yeah, it is. - Come on, we got a house to clean. (classical music) Oh wow. - [Claire] There's so much stuff. - We got a lot to clean. My parents are gonna kill me. - Yep. - Let's clean this. - Sounds good. - Okay. (classical music) (bottles thudding) (classical music) (car door opens) (car door closes) - Son, will you get off the phone and help me with these bags, please? - Yeah, well he can do it, 'cause my back is killing me. Oh my gosh, that traffic was terrible, worst ever. - Oh, if you could get that, that would help. Oh my back, it hurts. Oh gosh. All right, so. (classical music) Oh, does anybody else have a weird feeling in their stomach? I don't mean the burrito place we stopped at because that's a special feeling right there. But I've got another feeling and it's not right. There's something wrong. There's something very, very wrong. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute. (classical music) - Honey, leave the car alone. We need to go and check up on the girls. - But what if-- - No, no. You're just worried about the car and we need to go inside. (classical music) (door opens) - All right, we made it. - Girls, we're home. - Hi mom. Dad. - Ladies. Hi girls. How was your weekend? Everything go okay? - Yeah, everything went great. - Good, see our daughter. What did I tell ya? She is so trustworthy and her friend because she's such a good influence. You know, nothing bad would happen. See, that's something to be proud of. That shows that we did a good job parenting because most parents, they go away for a weekend and they leave their kid alone and then they gotta worry about the house being blown up or something crazy like that while they're gone. With our kids, you know, we know that we can trust them and they're reliable and they're responsible and we come home and everything's just fine. So, good job. - What the hell? Where are the keys to my car? You better not have messed my car. (door opens) (door closes) - You wouldn't know anything that he's talking about would you? - Never. (Alex winks) (upbeat music) ♪ We trade glances ♪ ♪ One look from her and she tears me apart ♪ ♪ Tears me apart ♪ ♪ I lead her through the city lights ♪ ♪ I hold her close so I feel the beat of her heart ♪ ♪ The beat of her heart ♪ ♪ She dances in the headlights ♪ ♪ She moves to the beat of the city ♪ ♪ We get lost in the summer heat ♪ ♪ We just drive like we never felt so free ♪ (slate clanking) - [Man] What's her eye line? - How do you make sound? (trombone playing) (Alex screaming) - Ow. (both laugh) - So where are your parents going? - Yeah okay. - Tired of getting picked on by. - Look at the window mechanisms. You have to use your hand because it's automatic. - You messed up that line. - Because it's... I don't know my line. - [Man] It's not electric. - It's not electric. Got it. - Think my mic fell. - Big surprise. We are all excited. Here we go and... Alex, what are you doing? You're gonna be a freshman in college with this bombass red apples, what is... Candy apple red. - Thanks Larry. I looked at the camera, I'm sorry. Family sticks... Sorry. - Bomb. Bomb. - Thank you Mr. Gleason. - Why is the door locked or something? (all laugh) (upbeat music) - [Man] She's back there? - Sergio, do you mind boy. - [Man] Take one. (slate clanking) 14 Charlie, take two, marker. (Claire chuckles) - Oh, crap. It was on park, sorry. - Copy that. - Ah. - Thanks band geek. - Excuse me, that part. - I'm I like. - I forgot my line. - My parents are 300 miles away to take my brother to see his new college dorm room. My parents are 300 miles away, taking my brother to see his. I tried my best to get Randy to notice me. And I know he saw me today. - Yes he did. - I know my brother. - I know where my brother left his keys. (both laugh) - [Man] Go towards the yard. - Okay. - Okay. - My brain is just like, what's a no? They have to see his new college dorm room. We were about to kiss. (both laugh) - [Man] Can you hold it, like, lift a little bit higher and then hold it for a second. - Okay. (Alex laughs) I'm not doing anything. (Alex laughs) - She's the one laughing. Okay, ready? - Yeah, I'm here to pick up my car. (Alex laughs) (all laugh) - Why is she laughing, I thought we laughing. - But you wasn't gonna laugh. - I just said, yeah. See, that was fun, wasn't it? - Yes. Can we do that again? - Yes. - Sorry. (both laugh) - Yeah, I was like. - [Man] Just light wise, to let you have it. - Ah, yes. - [Man] All right. (upbeat music) (all laugh) - Sorry, it's broken. (upbeat music) - You wouldn't know anything about... No. No. (upbeat music) - [Man] Cut. - Okay. (all laugh) (car engine revving) (crowd chattering) (car honking) (Alex screams) (car door closes) (car honking) - Hold on. (car honking) (keys jingling) (car honking) What? - It's lock button. (car honking) - You got the clicker? (car honking) - Yeah you hit something right here. - No you opened the door while it was locked. - Okay, let me see that. (car honking) (keys jingling) - I've never had this happen before. (car door opens) - You have to key in the ignition. - Oh. - I got it - I've never had that happen before. (upbeat music) (gentle music)
