Adhurs Re-Sync & Edit Tharindu_Lakmal_Jeewantha Goddamn! Our Asturias has delivered a son. What a great news, mother! The third time she has been blessed by God with son. You check the almanac and come to see your son, bye. Okay mother. Madam! Are you Kathrine’s relative? Yes, she's my daughter-in-law. - Her child is dead. What are you saying? - Yes, the child died unable to breath. Oh God! Third delivery... ...if my daughter-in-law knows the truth, she'll lose balance. Calm down madam, the dead never come back. But if you agree, I've an idea. Just now another lady delivered twins both male. I think she's very poor, if you take a child without her knowledge, her difficulties will ease and your daughter-in-law will also be happy. What do you say? When God takes away something, he gives something. We'll consider the child as God's blessings. Did you see the nose? Exactly like my father's. Isn't it, mother? Why are you shaking head differently? By any chance are you saying no? What's that nonsense? He's exact replica of grandpa. That's it! Look, how he's smiling like the temple bells. Sorry Indira! I don't know how it happened in one night? I think God felt I can't raise two children and took away one. Bye. According to horoscope, his name should start with 'N'. My father's name is Uncharacteristic. So his name is Amerindian Uncharacteristic, write son. Madam, according to his horoscope, name with letter 'N' will be good for him. Then, name him after Lord Lakshmi. Okay madam...Harassing! My dear Harassing! Charlie! What are you looking up there? Why are you looking at hen? I don't know why, grandma. I feel like eating it on seeing. Hen? - Hen? Bloody! I'll rap on your head. Did you see mother? What nasty wishes? I think he'll bring bad name to our family. Keep quiet, he's just a kid. What does he know? From today, I'll raise him like a pure Brahmin. Like a Brahmin? Isn't he a Brahmin then? Why are you hanging down your head? - Keep quiet. Let's arrange his thread ceremony, bad thoughts will vanish on it's own. Arrange it first. God bless you! Hail Lord Ganesh! If you trouble me or my fried again, you'll be dead. I went to sleep at 4 am and I got your phone call at 6 am. Look at the black circles around eyes. - Yes sir. How many? - 4 sir. - All are Parasol gang members. These 4 bodies perpetrated many crimes when alive. They were responsible for half of the city's crimes. Whether it's recent rape case in metro train or murder of Honduran brothers, there's no crime without their hand in it. Whether our time is good or their time was bad, they have become dead bodies. Is it good or want to go for another take?- Good sir. Why did you show me more fat last time on TV? Please take little care. Show some interest. Greetings Nair sir. What brings you here sir? This comes under my area. Though it's your area, those goons are from my area. I couldn't avoid it. If you Anti-Golconda squad take over all cases, what can we local police do then? Then, tell your men to get hot coffees. If we get the coffees, will you take over the cases? Look at him! How confusing he's who will take over the case? He has been like that since morning. But I don't like you ordering me to get coffees. You come sir, he'll not listen to anyone. Correct, that's why I'm also known as Mental Nair. Not about you sir, it's about the media. Where are the TV people? Have you seen the container that blew up? It blew up last night. - It was the staring point of the trouble. Ramona! You know how he killed him? Please leave me. Okay, I'll leave one and you leave one. - What? I'll leave the bullet, you leave the life. Was he killed last, sir? - Yes, he was the last victim. He has put dots perfectly on foreheads. How come he's predicting like Nostradamus? He's coming sir. Why did he kill them sir? - We'll know the details. Police should've imagination too along with investigation. Sir, that is... How does he know everything? I mean about that case... Please sit down. Tell me An and sir, how is your real estate business? Very dull sir. Bookings have come down and calls are on raise. What calls sir? Gangs! If anyone makes money, they call up for protection money. Did you get any such call...? - No sir, no calls like that. Is it you who thought about me? Is it you who called me? Tell me in which film this song comes? Maya bazaar, right sir? - You were right. Tell me in which film this comes? Bloody creep! This is my last phone call. Rs.2 cores, tomorrow night my men will wait for you. Even if it's one rupee short, not one in your family will survive. I'll pay sir, don't harm my family. Tell me in which film his dialogue comes? Do you know? - I don't know sir. Ramona, tell our men to do their job silently. What can we do? We've to do to get the truth. Sir, I paid Parasol after he threatened my family. You gave him okay, but whom did you send after them? Sir, I didn't send anyone. - True?- True sir. Tell me what actually had happened? - I went there sir. I gave them cash and returned. Was there only one man when you gave the cash? One man only sir. - Nobody else?- Nobody else sir. Ramona, after he left the place, what had happened there was... Is it smelling good? Who are you? Sal man, I'll take care of him, you go with the bag. Go and tell Thai. That's the story; he killed them and took away the cash. Though we may let him go, Parasol will not leave him. He'll think he has arranged to kill them. What should I do now, sir? - Where is Parasol? He's in Bangkok. He called me from there only. When he comes here, you go to Bangkok. Go! Rs.2 cores! What will he do with so much money? He'll throw away! Why should we bother about it? Add little love... Add little fire... Push a little... Add little sweet... Add little bitter... Add a little smile... Listen to me once more... Listen to my philosophy... Every minute is our friend... Drown yourself in the river of fun... life is intoxicating wine... Hail Lord Shiva! One is intoxicated by women... Another is intoxicated by God... Entire world is languishes in intoxication... One is intoxicated in stashing away... Another is intoxicated in stealing... Salvation of Man is in intoxication only... intoxication...unknown intoxication... Past, present and future is another intoxication... Man who lives for himself is the king... Lives in bottles... Tasty on opening... If you've patience, pour yourself from it... Youth is like ice, it melts away... Take chances and use it quickly... Fun...fun...its great fun to be born as human... If heart and glass is full, God comes after that... Grandma! Why did you shout now, Cheri? Did you see any snake? I don't care if its snake, it was a fish, grandma. How come fishes are there in a Brahmin's tank? Why did you cry so loud? - Not cries but fishes. Entire Brahmin neighbourhood has become impure, father. Besides as priest, somebody is growing fishes in the tank. Who would do it here? It may have come by mistake. Leave it. - Would I catch without leaving it? I left it long back. But I'll not leave this matter. Cheri, one or two fishes is common in tanks. Will they keep quiet? In few days it'll become hundreds. Without anyone personally putting it the tank? How can it be in the tank? I must know who did that. Why entire community is here? Nothing much, when I was offering evening prayers, a fish came into my hands. I was about to gulp it. Fish is irritating in hands but very tasty in mouth. Guru! I had a fish for Asthma as medicine. Would I eat every day? Forget about this. Getting late to the auspicious time for film, you come man, they are film personalities, if we go late, they'll finish the program using dupes. If we miss it, we can fix another time, why nobody is concerned about traditions getting mauled? Your son is becoming very orthodox. Don't get angry. Mother... Don't be so orthodox, if your Guru is angry, he'll remove you. My foot, grandma. He just talks, he can't chant any hymns, without me, he's nothing. Modern times need to be talkative, we've taken Rs.1 lake loan from him. If we don't listen to him, he'll ask us to repay immediately. Not one, let's pay 4 lakes to him, why should we be afraid of him? Pay him now. - How can I suddenly pay him? That's why, just do what he says till we repay the loan. Okay. What about the fishes? I'll get men to catch it, you go now. Get down. Less sugar? What's this lousy title? Remake film bought after paying heavily. Our Tabitha Bacchanal’s film 'Chenille Kim' in Hindi Why are you saying 'our'? Is he our uncle? He's also a Brahmin, we are from Hyderabad and he's from Allahabad. You've given me great energy. I don't know much about Bollywood, so I don't know much details. Are we dominating there also? It's giving me good kick. Come. Why are you so late, priest? Hero is coming. Want us to come early or come for the auspicious time? Where's the producer? I've to settle about payment. Savant sir is the producer, director and hero, except the heroine. Why isn't he doing that role too, bloody creep? Long live roaring star! He's like a patient, and they are calling him roaring star! Cheri, stop passing these comments. You too must stop it. Hello sir...hello man... break coconut offering prayers. Film will be a super duper hit. Great offering. We offered special prayers for your film to be a hit, if you pay our fee, we'll take leave now. Guru is waiting outside, a body is waiting in cremation ground. Come today evening, madam will pay you. Should we come back for the money evening for morning prayers? Impossible. - You want deluxe flat or Santos car? No chance of getting the fee here, will you present her a Santos car? What's this trouble in the middle? Not middle, this film started with our prayers, did you hear this? Not only he has less sugar, less money too. He used our service for prayers and not paying us. What's this, manager? I told him madam will pay, but he's not listening. Madam is near the pool, go and ask her. Madam? What is he to the madam? Grandpa. - What? Grandpa? Where is this silly girl? Oh God! Less sugar there and less clothes here. A girl is drowning, why are you all watching fun, you creeps? What's this? Why do you want to die? Committing suicide is sin, you know that? Wait...wait... - What are you doing? Mouth to mouth resuscitation, haven't you seen it in films? Who asked you to fish me out? No need of anyone's order to do good thing. I saw you in danger, I jumped in to save you. Why are you scolding me instead of saying thanks? It's all because of you, I lost the bet. Will your dad pay it? - Bet? I swear I wasn't aware of it. I saw bubbles in water... you will be angry on me. Because there's a mole on the left side of your waist. Not only that, you'll have twins. - What? Yes, mole astrology says that. Not only that, come closer, I'll tell you. Shut up! Why are you here? Roaring star sent me here to collect fee from his grand daughter. If you pay, I'll take leave. I'm not his grand daughter, she is. - She? Okay...okay... You lost Rs.10000, so pay him. Come. You all are girls, isn't it sin to have drinks in day time? This is party culture, you shut up. Take Rs.8000. - What about the balance Rs.2000? You saw my two moles, fee for it. Wouldn't you've given anything had I told about all moles I saw? Go away! Morning a fish and now a girl Don't know how many hurdles I may face today? Used to work in Defense research lab, Weapons designer, I want details about him. He died long back. - I know, is his wife still alive? Details about military men is confidential, can't tell you. Rules are for people like you not for criminals like us. Your aged parents live in 23rd sector of Chandigarh, poor old people, what if anything happens to them? Learn to save your family too along with this nation. This was the last communication address. House is very beautiful, by the way what do you do? You've bought such a big bungalow. Scrap...scrap business, mother. I'm exporting up there all the scrap from here. Is it? Do it son. Work hard day and night, earn more. You must be happy always without any difficulties. Okay mother. Look dad, she wants me to work day and night. You died in an accident, I'll die in an encounter. What are you saying, son? - Nothing, look around the house. Are all the doors closed? You're speaking in 3 languages like railway announcer. Who are you? I don't know which language you speak, that's why. Telugu, we are Telugu people, tell me. My name is Xanadu, I'm studying final year Bic in near by Eddy College, aunty, few rogues were after me. - Why are they after you? Beauty beauty is my problem. You're good looking, right? - Good looking? I'm a dasher. That's why they are after me. If you go around in such clothes, anyone would feel like that only. What to do? If we wear long skirt or churchyard, they say we belong to olden times, if I wear modern dresses, rogues are after me. Is he your son, aunt? - Yes. Do you stay here only? - Yes. Why? Nothing, I never saw you coming after me. There's no man who hasn't come after me, aunt. My son isn't like that. - I can see it. My energy is down after running around, can you offer me a health drink, aunt? I'll get it. House is very good, new one? What's this? Mother may come. Afraid of mother but not me, right? That's why I'm here, you haven't met me for 4 days. I'll come everyday. - Will you? I was teaching her self defense techniques to avoid oglers. Got it? You just follow it. - Thanks aunty. Please ask your son to drop me at home, aunty. Who? Me? Drop her son. - Come.- Come. How great it would be if my second son too was alive? What's this Guru? How can I be your friend? It's strange. What's strange in it? Friendship has no age bar. Did you call me urgently to tell this? No, I've hidden something from you. - Don't say you're not a Brahmin. I got doubt when you discussed about Hallie with Salim in old city. Stop your silly doubts. I want to ask you a thing.- What? - Have you ever fallen in love? Love? Me? Can we also fall in love? Why not? If you take history, Salim-Menkalinan, Romeo-Juliet, Lila-Maj nu, it's always them only, there no evidence of us in love. History is nothing, you can tear it away. But love isn't like that. You're going on talking about love, by any chance you... Are you feeling shy? Feeling shy too with this face. Stop feeling shy and tell me who is that girl. Maharajah Antipathy Shasta... - He's no more. He died in last Pushcart festival. I dated his eldest daughter Salonika while offering his obsequies. While chanting hymns? Mouth was chanting, but eyes were free. I tried but my bad luck. Before I could express my love, she got married. In that marriage I saw his second daughter Lakshmi, average girl, I fixed her marriage with another man, his third daughter Chandrasekhar is very... If you miss her too, you'll be left with mother only. I too have that tension. That's why I shifted mother and daughter to Narraganset. I'll introduce you to Chandrakala, you must tell her about me which I can't tell myself. Show me, I'll entangle with her. Please don't do that, like you help me in conducting marriages, just help my love, that's all. House is very big, Guru. You must also tell big about me. Definitely...Guru! Are you fine, aunty? What can we lack in when you're with us, Bathtub? Bathtub? - Aunt calls me fondly. Come in. He's...? - My cousin, my disciple too. Greetings. - Greetings. You've come in hot sun, I'll get you cool water.- Okay. Guru, these furnishings... - I sponsored it. I think they have used you very well. Let them use me, I'll be happy if my love succeeds. I think you've become very busy, you seldom come here. Then what? Jogging at 6, to gym at 7, Yoga at 8, Guru is trying for six pack body. Enough of it. - Keep quiet Guru. In fact I'm surprised how you still remain a bachelor. I must find the girl I like, right? What do you say aunt? Yes, you're getting old too. What? My guru getting old? In fact when he was conducting a marriage, bride was ready to elope with him, why don't you tell her? How can I say? It's routine in every marriage. Aunt would've heard about it. - No, I didn't. May be people are not talking about it. Don't stretch it anymore, lest it may break. I too feel the same. Where is Chandra, aunt? Just now went to change after offering prayers. If you feel I'm saying too much, Chandra is like sweet in skirt. You're like bier in dhoti. Will it match? You... - She's here. Why does she comes every time? She's coming. Why isn't she lifting her head? Shyness...I'll make her lift. She...? - What? I need to talk to urgently. Come out I say. What's this nonsense? Please listen to me, it's not nonsense. How many times I've told you to call me as Bathtub? Okay Bathtub. Two-in-one you gave isn't working, I'm finding it difficult to hear 'Mahabharata’s' early morning. If you send him in, I'll explain it to him. That's all? My boy is all-in-one. He'll repair it in minutes. Go. I too want to tell you about that two-in-one only. First repair hers. Why are you pushing me? What's this boy? - Boy? Yes, boy! - Yet again! Will you tell the truth to your Guru? Won't I? You've used my Guru to buy TV's, fridge, VCR's, two-in-ones. How can I keep quiet? - Okay, tell him. I'll also tell him. - What? Where you held me in the pool and about searching moles on my body. Come, let's tell him. - You tell him, his heart will break. Isn't it? Then let's keep shut. - What? Mouth.- Then open it. - What?- Door. Is the job done? - It wasn't ordinary, troubled me a lot. Though it troubled you, job is done, right? Chandra, be ready, we are going out evening. Where to? I said no but you forced me to come. I hate pubs. Romance in public is thrilling. Don't spoil the fun. Is it necessary to go with tufts? It's free, would I come if we've to pay? I conducted the opening ceremony of this pub. What's this Bathtub, I'm uncomfortable in this dress? Yes, you hate clothes, right? I'm embarrassed without dhoti. What's this? Black dress code, can't avoid it. To hell with codes. Why? - For pub's ad. Why are you settling down here? Get me a beer. What? Liquor? Cheri, you're strong in hymns but weak in epics. What Gods have? - Heavenly drink! Locals call it as barrack, here it's beer. Get it now. Whatever the name is, the result is the same. Hey you! Give me a beer. Just now you took a beer. What? Me? Beer? When did you give me? You silly fellow, don't kill me with your butler English. You mayhem mistaken in dark. What's this nasty? You're pinching my buttocks. Who are you? Why are you speaking like that? - That's my style. Give me a beer quickly, girls are pinching buttocks here. You're very irritated. Hey...hey...why are you going there when I'm here? Why don't you talk to me? Keep it. Sit there. Where are you going? - Do I've to tell you? Are you angry? - No, tuft. I think he's coming back to say sorry. That one? An old man took it from me. I wanted to hit him but left him respecting his age. You give me a beer. Take your beer. - Give me little time. Why are you disturbing me? Who is he? Your uncle? Trying to hold back laugh, right? I thought he's your uncle. Even enemy mustn't face such situation. Yes, please do something. What do you think of yourself? Though he appears like old man, he's youth inside. Like gray hair at young age, he's old at young age. Lousy! You go, I'll manage myself. Guru! - Give us some privacy. Go. Why are you staring at me? Will you pinch me? Come on pinch me! Behave decently. - Decency? Who is decent here? I'm dying in this cigarette smoke, I'm going out. If I force him to come, he'll show me hell. What a figure, buddy! I'm fixed! Where did you go? Why are you so moody for forcing you to come here? I expected a lot from you. You've brought me to a dirty place. Shall we dance, Chandra? - Dance? I don't know to dance. Do I know to dance? Get on the floor, you'll start dancing. Bathtub, they are wantonly touching me. Why are you disturbing us? Chandra, let's go home. - Why don't you say something? What can I say when they hit me? Come, let's go. Move...move... You go home. - Why? Go...please... Why suddenly? - I said go. It's common to get hit in pubs. You don't feel bad. You wouldn't have got beaten if I wasn't with you. They would've died if you weren't with me. Killed them instantly. Unnecessarily I brought her out. Why are you leaving hurriedly? I'll drop her at home. Let's talk after that. - No, let's talk now. That's all! Come. - Come. What's this nuisance? - Nuisance? Leave her with us and walk out. You're young and have good future, if you try any girl, you'll get them. I got her after years and moreover invested heavily on her. Guru! Where did he go away? Guru! Guru! Where did he go away? Pay bill? You made us conduct opening ceremony for free, now you want us to pay the bill. Call the owner crook. I'll take him to task. Call him. Priest, you go. - How can I? I was going but these two fools stopped me. They tortured me till now. Scold them before me, only then I'll go. Idiots! say sorry to him. I'll thrash you, idiots! - You carry on, priest. I think all the useless guys are here only. Why did you leave without me? Were you really so angry? How can I not be angry on them? I was so angry that I wanted to tear them like Lord Harassing... You're fine, aren't you Cheri? - Nothing will happen to him. I too have beaten up many goons but never before a lady. Must be careful when ladies are around, let's go home. They may come back. Then, I'll come by auto, you drop Chandra at her home. Me? Solo? - Yes, you...solo...come. Can't you say something instead of driving silently? I know only hymns, nothing else. Then do one thing, praise me with your hymns. Praise you? What should I praise? Praise about... Hail your beautiful eyes... Hail your pink sweet lips... Hail your silken tresses... Hail your Kohinoor like ravishing beauty... Hail your devastating beauty... Hail your sheen that makes me go sleepless... My heart is boiling with hot passions... My youth is breaking into pieces... Your structure is mind boggling... Flower offering for your style... Prayers for your shine... Incense sticks and lamps for your glitter... Dedication for your walking gait... I'll bloom like flower at your each step to kiss it... I'll become your sari to be with you always... Don't spread around your beauty to incite young men... Don't spread your charm to force me to cross line of decency... My heart beat races fast on seeing you... Like fire crackers, burst on me like a she-devil... Maj. Chandrasekhar was my brother-in-law. After his death, his wife, my sister who was pregnant then lived with me. My wife didn't like her. She insulted and sent her out of home. I wasn't here then, later I frantically searched for her, but no use, a relative informed about seeing her in Hyderabad, I searched there also, but still didn't find her. By the way, who are you? I'm going to meet Calcutta Babar, you comb every slum in Hyderabad. Call me on finding her. - Slums? Yes, all destitute go to slums only. Go, search. What's the price of bridals? - Rs.20 a kg. What? Rs.20? My foot! I don't get that much even if I chant hymns for an hour. It won't grow in one hour, it'll take six months. Look at him, he's selling words too with vegetables. Lousy beetroot face! - Leave him. I will, you sit at home and eat. Pick bridals quickly. Take your money. The note has holes. When bridals you sell has worms, can't my note have holes? Who the hell are you man? Granny! What happened? You were fine till now. I'm having chest pain. Not that side, let's go this side. I told you many time not to eat pickles and chutneys. A month has passed since I demanded money. Why are you putting off? Your grand son...what's that school? It seems you got him admitted to Slovak School. Do you want him to study well and come good in life or die? Don't harm him, I'll pay whatever your demand is. Now you speak like human, in 1 hour my boys will be in city center, send Rs.1.5 cores with them. - Okay...okay...I'm coming with money. Brother! Go to city center and bring money from Seth. Okay, brother. Come...- Brother. - Call Venerate. Brother. You also go to the city center. Watch the proceedings from a distance. Someone has killed 4 members of Parasol’s gang. Let's be careful. Keep an eye, be alert. Tell me. - Brother, safe. Got the cash. Come to Hyderabad guest house. It seems someone is targeting gangs in the city, it seems he killed Parasol’s men also while taking cash like this. Are you scared? - No way, why would I get scared? I'm just giving you information. I suspect we have company. Mad man! If he comes behind, it doesn't mean company. Why to take risk? Let's stop aside and empty the bladders. Should we piss in fear? - Is pissing means fear? We piss ten times a day, are we doing it in fear? Your candidate has gone. Why are you scared? Scared? How many people we had killed till now? Did I ever get scared? You turn back and go after him, I'll kill him for fun. Who are you? - Shariah Khan's cousin brother! Is it necessary to know the details? Where is the cash bag? He has a gun! You don't know about my boss Panda, he'll kill you wherever you may hide. Keep quiet, why are you inciting him? What bothers us if he kills or not after we are dead? Please leave me. My girl friend warned me not to join these rogues. I didn't listen to her. Please leave me, I'll go back to my native place Under. Are you scared of me or my gun? I too handled guns, I'm scared of you only. You look like a torpedo. You fool! Why are you begging at his feet? Bloody shut up! Why are you shouting at me? Why are you staring at me? Shall I tell him and get you killed? Brother, first kill him. Please leave me, I'll go back to Under. Bloody! Holding a small gun and moving it casually, will you stylishly point at us? Brother Seen. Sorry brother, forgive me please don't mind me. Watch now, I'll bite his neck to death. Who do you think I am? I've come from Under. Would anyone expect you to point a second gun? Please leave me, I beg you. You act very well, where did you learn to act? In Under. - What shall I do now? What else? Kill them, drop me in Under, you too can see Under. Nair sir! Greetings! Brother, we are safe. Nair sir, this mad man has been threatening us, kill him. Brother, tell him. - Sir, he killed the gangs in city. He killed Parasol’s gang, kill him. Why are you hesitating? Kill him sir. He wishes very much, kill him. Don't kill me. Why so many twists? You ordered and he killed them. I'll tell you later but first get the cash bag. Okay brother. Brother! - What? - Have you spared me? You couldn't know it because of fat, you were shot long back. How could you kill me so silently? This is yours and this is mine. - I don't want. I'm not doing this for money. I want my job. You're doing the same job what an SI does without joining police. What's the difference? There is sir, I can't tell my mother also what I'm doing now. If I do the same thing in uniform, everyone will talk about me. I'm after you for two years now. SI recruitment announcement will be made in 3 months. Wait till then. One more important thing. Why are you staring at him? - You keep quiet daddy. You didn't come to my dance program because of him, right? I forgot about it. He's not in any way connected to it. He came just now. - Why are you still after the S’s job? If you trust my dad, can't even become a constable. No girl will marry a police man. Didn't your mother marry your father? Will anyone commit a mistake knowingly? You mean am I waste? - Did I say that? You both go in, we need to talk. You said about an important matter. Got information about Parasol coming to the city. You be careful. - You must be careful sir. If anything happens to me, you'll be in trouble. Brother, Parasol is coming. Pandu, I can understand your pain. Look, we asked for two, he has sent four. He asked one and half, he has sent three. I suspect he's killing mathematically. What do you say? You'll think I'm talking silly but I'm serious. The man who killed my men has killed your men too. We both want him. He must die in our hands. Has anyone of your men seen the killer? No. He killed all the three people including my brother. Who got the news? He! But he says he didn't see anyone. Didn't you suspect anyone? - No, brother. Mad man! Recollect the scene. He'll not be far from us, he'll be very near only. Recollect where our men were. No brother. Try to remember, it'll be a lone man very close to our people. Nowl remember, brother! A man followed our men, when they went with cash, he followed them. I'm sure it's him. - But you said you didn't see anyone. Pandu, stop... I'll talk to him. Can you recognize him? - I can, his face is unforgettable. How does he look like? Look, this is the last time, don't accept funerals. It's stinking. - Let's use incense sticks and manage. Why manage instead of refusing? Once you accept priesthood, you've to do everything. Not that Guru... - You kid... Old man! - Come! Elder brother you're still alive I'm sad about your brother's death. You mean? - I didn't mean you must die. Chari, start the rituals. Take rice and put into the mouths of the bodies. Take the bodies and cremate them. I mean cremate them. Already over? Offered only rice. Then offer full meals, bodies will eat. Sir, if you pay us, we'll take leave. Though he's a goon he pays well. How dare you say a priest has killed them! Why can't he do it? We can't trust anyone in our business. No doubt it's him. He covered the tuft with a cap. You don't get confused, this is not a silly matter. We shouldn't take chances because he's just a priest. I'll confirm if he's that same guy or not. You can gun him down then. You come with me. Your son...? - My son is not an astrologer, but I am. Then your son? Concentrate on your horoscope. - Tell me. One is weak and one strong. What is weak and what is strong? Favourable signs are weak and bad signs are strong. You're running very bad time. That will be worse. - Long life or is there any break? Around the same time next year... ...you'll be on streets. Father, take coffee. Who is he? - Me? I mean, who is he? He's too much. Come and sit. - Why are you in a hurry? I'll tell you good news, come. Got hold of any billionaire client. Billionaire? Why are you leaving? There's lot to tell. My foot! Horoscope is checked for good future only, not to lose interest in life and become mendicant. Aunty called me urgently. - Why? It seems Chandu is eager to marry after pub visit. It means poison has turned into manna. Yes. - Go fast. Bhattu may die on knowing I'm going to marry Chari. Let him die, useless man. Will you spoil your life for him? I think he's here. Come in Bhattu. - Where is Chandu? She's inside due to tension. Why is she feeling shy seeing me? You go out. - No... Let him stay here. - No, I don't want anyone between us. You, me and aunty. You go out. Both went in and he came out. I never expected I'll ever fall in love. But I've fallen in love. I'm much tensed to tell you about my love. I'm also tensed to hear it. What's this feeling? I feel like my heart is shivering. - Old heart, it will shiver. Please encourage me. He came and went in. He's standing outside only. What could've happened there? - Shall I inquire them? Don't ask, observe them. Why are they following me since morning? Bloody fools! I think he's suspecting us, he's coming here. All of you be quiet, I'll manage him. You always answer it on seeing me. And it rings only after you do it. What's the matter? It happens when you're tensed. Who is tensed? You or phone? If it has, it's mine too. - Why are you following me? You started off from my home, stopped here, what's the matter? We are not following you, we are waiting for a purpose here. You will know it. - I said I want to know it now. Chari, come here. Don't talk to strangers. He too is like your phone. Coming Guru.- Come here. Why are you calling me? - They want you inside. Me? Why? I think marriage can't be fixed without you. Everything is fine, right? Not fine, she says love and marriage, but not committing with me, I'm also unable to ask her openly, you come and deal. Come. Did your Guru tell you everything? He did.- Then, do you accept this proposal of marriage? No need of his acceptance, let's go head, aunty. How could he come out so quickly? You went in just now, how could you change so quickly? Move away. I need to go urgently. First you clarify my doubt. Is it cleared? What's this new confusion? He has changed the get up and fooling us. Do you think another man is inside? Had uncle been alive we wouldn't face any problem? Though he's not with us, aren't you here for us? You must conduct Chandu and Chart's marriage. What are you saying? She's right. I understood it after long suspense. I should've cut you when you talked about entwining with her. Guru, please listen to me. Don't call me like that, you kicked on my heart. No sir. Is he one or two? - One man is acting as two. Please listen to me, Guru... - I too cheated many but not like this. Auto, come here! - He's escaping, follow him. A girl wants to marry only you if not wants to commit suicide. Tell him mother. Marry her, boy. She'll be here. What she'll be here? We'll go to streets. They are not ordinary ladies, they took everything by cheat from my Guru. This old lady Suryakantham is very cunning. Your Guru is no innocent man, he too is a cheat. Why is coming with a gang? Granny, I can't avoid telling you this. My Guru loves Chandrakala. - Oh my Bhattu! What are you saying? - Truth!- Our Bhattacharya? Yes granny, it's him. Useless man! With holy marks on forehead. Dirty rotten face! Come in Bhattu! We were discussing about you only. I heard everything, entire community has heard it. Shouldn't a pot bellied man fall in love? What is my profession? Priest! I've to sit and work. Won't I have a pot belly? Are they having six pack body? Can you guaranty that he won't get a pot belly? Discussion is about marriage not stomach. Please don't be so harsh, I feel hurt. Aren't you ashamed? Do you want love? What's wrong in it? He took care of that family in troubles, he shared theirjoys and sorrows, is it wrong to think of marrying the old woman to give her a life? Please don't feel shy, I feel like killing myself. Guru, you told me you love Chandrakala. I told them the same indirectly. They misunderstood me, fools! Did you not plan to marry the mother? Planned to marry the daughter? Dirty rogue! Women of this neighbourhood will spit on your face. Let's go. - Let's go. Why are you still here? Get going. I'll go if you repay my loan of Rs.4 lakhs. Rs.4 lakhs? You said Rs.1 lakh only. It was when terms were good, now added interest. Why should they pay you? My son-in-law has been your assistant for 4 years, have you ever paid him a rupee? Your loan is settled, go now. Son-in-law? Already become relatives. No Guru... - Stop it. Got saved because I don't know hymns, else I would've cursed you. I'll not leave this issue so easily. - Please listen to me, Guru... Be careful! When shall we fix the marriage, aunt? What for? For your obsequies? What's that nonsense? Your daughter is my daughter-in-law. That's settled. Did you see? She winked at me when you all are here. Winking? What's that? Bloody women! Father, they cheated my Guru using such tricks. I've to find him now...Guru... Idiots! Who are you guys? Has my Guru sent you? Do you know how many times I saved him because he doesn't know hymns? Leave me, he has got no loyalty too. Guru! Are you also here? Did you see his double action? He was abusing me and suddenly changed on seeing me. He's a crook! Kill him sir! Why should they kill me? - Shut up! Did you kill my men? - Oh God! Why would I kill? Guru, you're framing me in murder case because of personal revenge. I'm innocent, please trust me. Don't trust him, Pandu. I'm sure he killed your men. He thrashed goons in the pub. - Me? In pub? I scolded them, I never slapped them also. You slapped me. They are nothing to you.- Me? Nephew, he changed get ups and confused us, he's confusing you now by changing the topic, I'm confirming, it's him, kill him. Sir...how many prayers I had conducted in your home, I offer obsequies to the dead, why should I kill them? Please save me, killing Brahmin is sin. Tell him to down the gun. - I still can't believe it's him. Why would he come to my home after killing my men? Let's lock him up here, if another incident happens, then it's not him. What do you say? Why are you taking me again? I'm innocent sir... I'm sure he'll fail in this test. Bye. - Stop. Lock him also. We conducted functions together but not murders, leave me. Tell me. - We found Major's son. Yes sir. What a great news you've for me! I'm coming there. Narasimha! What are you doing now? O maiden! I can't bear such great beauty! Don't take away my life with your sharp eyes and devastating body... It's not my mistake, ask my grandmother... Why did she raise me so lovely with great care? Oh God! Hot passions are taking over me... Do I've to spend my nights sleepless? Pink lips...black tresses ...fair heart... Unite me with you... Sexy waist...stylish walk... romance of youth... Make your heart my abode... You're my love...I'm your man... Shall we go together to beautiful Arabian desert? Don't follow me like a lion... Don't worry for being single... As darkness envelops... sleep in my arms... Don't shrill like anklets... Don't squeal like bangles... Don't shriek like a chain... unite with me... May I come to you dear? May I kiss you, my love? I must thank profoundly your grand mother... Outsider has entered our business, few days back Rasool lost men and recently I lost my men, we lost big money, let's settle the differences between us later, we can take on him only if we stand united, that's why I called this meeting. Let's kill him, tell me who is he? - How to catch him? Let's target MS, the top most industrialist in the city, let's demand huge amount, I'm sure he will come for the money, we'll lynch him. Go...go... You think you got saved because of gun jam, I made it purposefully not to open, the killer too doesn't know it. What do you want? - Rs.5 crores. This time gun will go off. I'll pay, where should I come? Come to Attapur cement factory. Are you following him? - Yes. Don't miss under any circumstance. Very big deal. This is my last deal with you. Rs.5 crores. You go. Why hasn't he come yet? Is the priest still there? No, he's not here. Escaped. - How did he escape? Why do you get tensed? He'll come here. He's here! Thanks for coming. Offering prayers as priest, silently killing men, were you planning to fool us? Prayers? I think you've lost mind in the shock. Consult a doctor. You're surrounded by my men, how bravely you speak like that! That's the only thing I have. Looks like you've been trapped! How dare you love my daughter! When I can tap their phones, can't I tap your phone? Die...die in their hands. Surprized to see the man who wanted you dead saving your life? He saved you because I want your life. I brought you here. Who is he? He's Naik I told you about. Thanks for your help, from now you're also my man. I brought you this far because I need you. To know the need, I've to tell you a story. Your father was a weapons designer in army, he designed a weapon, I asked him to give the design, because that's my business, he refused, then I flipped through the pages of your dad's past, I hit up on your dad's close friend Dhanraj, I used his friendship to kidnap your father, your father later died in an accident, of course I arranged that accident, shall I give you a surprize? Your father is still alive. I'm investing billions on your father to design a weapon, just 6 months away from completion your dad gave me a shock, he wants his family, it took many days to find you. Father! Major, you insisted on family, here's your son. Your father doubts authenticity of you. I'll never play games in such serious matters. It's your responsibility to prove that you're his son. Prove it. I'm away from my family for many years and working for him as dead man, please don't cheat me. Tell me the truth...you are... Father! I'm your son. Just a minute. Mother, hold on the line. A man will talk to you. Hubby! Who said there are no sentiments? Look at their emotions. It's not safe to keep son here for long. He's very cunning! Let's shift him. Father, you don't worry. I'll not let them take the weapon designed by you, I'll free you from here, father. - He told me you're very cunning. Will you take him? Will you take your father with you? You can't even locate this island. Governments of 14 countries shake up on hearing my name. Shall I kill your father? - No. Your son will be with me in Calcutta, I'm giving you a month's time, finish it. If you don't finish it in a month, I'll clip a part of your son's body. Be careful. - Please don't harm my son.- Finish it. Where is he? Who is he? He looks very tough. Our Major's son, he'll stay with us. It's your responsibility to keep him safely here. Don't give me such risky jobs. - Why? I feel controlling him is difficult. - Why? Think logically, you'll know the risk in it. What is it? We can only threaten Major with death, can't kill him till he completes it. Yes, we can't. When he gets that idea, he needn't have to be with us. He'll escape! Bloody idiot! Don't shoot him! If anything happens to him, we'll be in trouble. Tell him! - Yes brother. Have you closed all the doors? How can he come out now? It's him! Enough...enough of it. You're not able to understand, if you escape, I'll be in trouble. You can't go anywhere, come. Come! Take my mother and hide her somewhere. Be careful! What happened? I'll tell you later, first do what I told you.- Okay. Bloody! Why did you give an idea which he didn't get? I didn't expect this turn. I said it for logic, he did it practically. He's not a man to run away, if he has run it means he has a plan. Keep quiet sir, don't raise his tension. Think not about him, what if major wants to talk to his son. Is it from Major? - Yes. Don't look at me, answer his call and say something. Tell him. Give the phone to my son. He's not with me, I'm outside. Am I your son's PA? Don't call on phone, do your work. I'll start working after talking to my son. What did he say? Did he say he'll start working after talking to his son? No, he asked me to kill you. How could you guess everything right? Give me a chance. I'll go to Hyderabad and abduct any of his relative or friend. How will you get hold of them? One of my friends is member of Rasool's gang. I'll seek his help to find them. Nobody is alive in Rasool's gang, he killed all of them. Won't you ever talk positively? Always pessimistic! My friend could be alive, right? Please give me a chance. Call him. Switch on the speaker. One minute. No smiles here, pick up the phone man. Basha bhai, I'm Meta from Calcutta. - Meta? You used to cal me as broker when you were young. It's me Calcutta Meta. Who ever you may be, Rs.15 for a pant, Rs.10 for a shirt, Rs.5 for underwear, If you give two pants, one shirt free, for two shirts, one underwear free, taxes extra, fixed rates. How come you've changed totally? I didn't change, a man changed me. He wiped out all the gangs. My finances went dry and I started a dry cleaning shop. I need a help from you. I'm interested only in dirty clothes not with men. If you help, it'll save my life. I served free in your younger days. I'll take any risk till my life is not in risk. My friend is alive, I'll bring someone related to Major. Trust me. Okay, you will bring, but how will you communicate to this man? Let's take care of it then. Don't ask for logic while I'm tensed. Send his photo to me as MMS. Why do you need a photo? You've seen him, haven't you? I've seen him but my friend must see him, right? He!- I escaped from this man only and you've come for him. If you go to him, you'll die. - I'll die even if I don't. Please take me to him. I can't take you to him but I'll take you to a priest his look alike. A priest like him? - Show me. I saw him while escaping from him. It means they two. You mean to take priest in his place. What if my boss finds this? Die is one, you can take as many copies as possible. He's Baba, he may recognise him. I myself couldn't recognise him, how can Baba recognise him? Will he come with us? He may come for big money. - I'll pay in full cash. Bad time may set in, put the ring immediately, Chari. Stop it! You can't put rings or exchange offers later. For the present, engagement is stopped. What's this Bhattu? Instead of blessing them you're stopping it. This is bad too. - It's bad for me too. Is my love failure at this age a small matter? So I got a stay order from High Court to stop this engagement. Read it lawyer. Yes sir, court has decreed to stop engagement till you settle his loan. This is very strange, I heard about stay orders on buildings and businesses. Will they stop functions too? - They will, that is law. You hit me with love and I hit back with law. Rs.15 lakhs I had invested on Chandrakala, and Rs.4 lakhs due from you, I must get Rs.19 lakhs to let you unite. Bhattu, you promised to save us but hell bent on ruining us now. I wanted to save you but you played with me. That's why I'm stopping you. Let anyone create hurdle this engagement will go on as scheduled. He?- You...? - It's me. He's exactly like him. - That's why I brought you here. How much he has to pay you? I mean Rs.19 lakhs. - Take rs.20 lakhs with tip. I'll pay in full cash. Why are you paying so much for him? You want money or reason? I want Chandrakala. - I'll kill you. I'll lynch you! Get out! How am Ito repay your gratitude? Few days of your life. - Want me to conduct any sacrifice? No. You must act. - Act? Are you making any film? No, there's another majust like you. We too got affected as you for his deeds. When I told you about a man like me, you didn't believe me, granny. How can I not believe you? You know there will be 7 look alikes in this world. Let's stop with just two, grandma. You explain to them. His boss is notorious don in Calcutta. He escaped from him. - He means this guy? No. The man like you. You don't go with him he threatened to kill him. He means the man like me, right? - No, he means his boss. Just now you said he means my look alike, now you say his boss. Earlier he was your look alike, later he was his boss. What happened to him then? - Him means? I mean my look alike. No need of anything, let's take him with us. Please show some pity... - What my son is supposed to do? Your son must exact like him, if you want take another 30. 30 mean thousands, right? - It's lakhs!- Lakhs? Lakhs! Will you accept? It'll take years to earn such huge money. Will you let him do anything for money? He's our only heir, what if anything happens to him? Nothing will happen, grandma. Please don't stop them. You come there and say just three words. Just three words only, not a word more than it. Okay, but you need to change your get up. Can I avoid it after accepting your offer? What are you saying? - Yes, I've brought him. Look! Bloody! How dare you escape from me? Where did you think of going away? What's your plan? - Tell me your plan. Don't know, forgot, don't remember. - What is this? I mean we hit on his head on seeing him. Ever since then he has been saying these three words only. If you disturb him, he may forget that also. I suspect him, Baba. Is he the same man? Will you please keep quiet? Why do you always poke your nose? Bring someone like you. Is it that easy? Will there be similar people? I think he's very snoopy, send him away. No... - Will you shut up? We want him, if he asks, we must show him. That's all. His father is pestering to talk to him. Don't know, forgot, don't remember, this is what he says. Can I train him to speak three more words? Training? - Yes. If you tell me what to say, I'll train him. Who are you?- I'm his owner. - Owner? Wait, we can't answer their doubts. Want to train him or not? - Do something. Come son. - Come. Priest, if you speak 3 more words, the job will be done. You got paid, right? - I forgot. Why is saying this to us? - Wait, they are stingy about fee. This was really good. Those 3 words... We'll pay. He'll Pay- - I'll pay. Major! You were earning to see your son, here's your son. How are you son? I'm fine, are you fine, father? I'm fine. They are not troubling you, right? I'm fine, are you fine, father? Won't he speak anything other than this? He knows a third one too. Why isn't he speaking? I think he has forgotten it. He'll pick up slowly. Tell me if you've any problem, son. Okay father, I'll do as you say, father. Third one is over. - He'll start from the first. Why are you talking differently, son? He's also mad like you with swing of mood every minute. Major, the faster you finish it the better for everyone. Take good care of my son. - We will. I didn't feel so tensed while watching world cup match too. Job is done, right? - You take him away from here. Come son. You're very lucky. If it's that man, he'll escape often. If it's this man, he'll stay here only. Who is he? - Abhishek Bachchan's father... After everything is ready, if this man talks to Major like this, Major may fear son's safety and situation will be back to square one. Think about it. You needn't get tensed. I'm sure his mother will be in my daughter's control. Because my daughter is his girl friend. I'll bring his mother. Is it you?- Yes, it's me. - It's very nice here. These fools didn't pay even Rs.5000 for half day's work. But here they are paying a lakh for every word I speak. Trust me. What are you trying to tell me? Will you settle there only? Why have any doubt? Already settled here. Don't get surprized if I become Don Chari. Don? - Don! Where is your dhoti? Where is your old bike? Where is your old style, Chari? What's this new suit, boot, French cut, and Gulf scent, Chari? I don't want dhoti and old bike... I don't want the old style, my girl... I like this new suit, boot, French cut, and Gulf scent, O my girl... You were cute like farex baby, but have now turned into a RDX bomb... To match with your Rolex body, I remixed myself... Stripped it! Cut it! Wiped it! Oh God! He steals hearts! You never drink water without seeing inauspicious time... You went overboard and said good morning with your lips... O maiden, as per the sentiment... I slipped and stamped the fox's tail... That luck gave me more kick, my dear... You were like vermicelli _upma but now become like Chinese noodles... I changed my style for a Miss Femina like you... If I rewind your story, you were innocent like hero of 'Swathimuthyam'... Don't know when my tongue slipped and chanted hymns wrongly... My flashback went kaput and ended up like this, O girl... You were like local red bus but now become stylish like airbus... I've changed myself to stand up to your golden beauty... Brother-in-law, you called me from Calcutta but you're silent. Is it love failure? I think this scene is unavoidable for any lover. Won't you be happy if I get married? I may not be able to bless you but I'll be happy. Chari ruined my happiness. I spent all my earnings on Chandrakala and dating her, he took her from my side to his side. You've to step aside, what else can we do? We can do. Do you know who Baba in Calcutta is? I hear he's a don, what do you want him for? He has gone to cheat him also along with me. How? - There's a man just like him. There's talk here that Chari went there to act like him for big money. On inquiry I found it was true. We must tell this truth to Baba. Not a big deal, let's find his address. If he misses, we must finish him. Be prepared for that too. We needn't do it, there are many to do it for us. Finish him means kill him. I didn't expect so much fire in you. Not only you, didn't I too expect. Have you quit? Go away! Did you call for inauguration ceremony, Sheela aunt? Yes sir, from your place only. That's why I called you, go in. Still in dress? Are you from Andhra? - Yes. You're lucky to get me as the first client. Every girl who had me first became very famous. Mine is lucky hand. Who is he? That man or this man? Who are you? He's that man! I came here for fun, fighting doesn't suit me, bye. Where's the island in which my father is kidnapped? Trust me, I don't know. Not only me, nobody here knows it. Baba keeps it secret from everyone. But Dhanraj knows it. Trust me. Where can I find Dhanraj? Nobody knows his whereabouts. But every Friday he visits Cyclone pub. You'll definitely find him there. Leave me, many women are dependent on me. Goddess Kali, see that nobody comes here to tell the truth of twins to Baba. Take Baba's address. What are you saying? - Yes, he's in Calcutta. Thinking about him is giving me shivers. Why didn't you catch him? If you see a tiger, you escape not try to catch it. Someone from Hyderabad is here to meet Narasimha. Who would it be? Is it you, Guru? - You changed your style. What brings you here? I didn't come, vengeance has brought me here. Why are you talking like a villain? - Yes, I'm a villain. I should've been a hero, you and Chandu joined to make me a villain. What do you want now? It's sin! We are already engaged. If I tell you the truth, your obsequies will be over. Truth? - That you're not what you're now. The truth about your contract to act. You know better than me what will happen if Baba comes know this. That's all? - Yes, your end. Won't you change your heart? When I get angry I don't change my brief, heart is nothing. Okay, give me a minute. What? - He's here seeking revenge. Threatening to tell the truth to Baba. - I'll kill him. Why? We must cheat him not kill him. He has come to wrong place at wrong time. He mustn't go out. Baba's right hand Basha is calling you, he's in that room, meet and tell him. Come whatsoever it may! You've become very dare. I'll teach you a lesson. Greetings sir. - Close the door. Tell me. - The man here is I heard fire crackers busting. Guru! Did you kill Basha? Killed him? When I entered the room, lights went off. When lights came back, gun is in my hand and body is there. It's known as murder here. Are you dead? You killed him. - I don't know. Will you kill our Basha? - No. Will you cut Baba's right hand? - I didn't do it. Meta, please stop. Please forgive him for my sake. Even if I forgive him, Baba will not. Save me please. - We are ready to do anything. Okay, I'm leaving him for your sake. Baba will be here now, let's first dispose the body. Soul will not rest if you throw body in sea without conducting rituals. Are you talking about rituals after killing him? Please stop his abuses. Please stop your wild abuses. You forget about rituals, you come. I never expected to get caught in murder case. I too didn't expect to get murdered. What happened, Guru? Basha is still alive. - Where? Inside. - Who is he then? He's Basha, right! Who was he then? You may have mistaken someone else for him. How can I mistake? Don't I know the man I killed? Then is it you who killed him? Calm down, I said that in a flow. Chari, tell him take away the body. - Take care fo the body. I'm taking because you told me. If not...- No. We belong to Brahmin community, but he's freely using bad words. Please stop abusing and take care of the body. Okay. Have you bid adieu to my body? Look there Basha! Where? - Can't you see him? Souls are not visible to all. It seems soul is speaking to me. No soul or ghost, you're blabbering in shock. I'm not seen or heard by anyone except you. Why that exclusive facility to me? - Because you killed me. From now you're my companion, I'm your shadow. Come...come...where are you guys? You...?- Any doubt? I knew it, I got doubt when you played a drama. You're playing drama, where's the island with my father? I'll not tell whatever you may do. You will tell! Will you tell now? - I will. I'll tell. He's in Bard island about 160 kms from Kalighat. Even if you go there, you can't free your father. Why? Your father's lab is made of heavy metal, even 100 kgs of RDX can't break it open. There's a code to open it. Only Baba knows it. Details about the code is in his laptop. Free me. It must be decided by my father not me. Till then be my guest. - Release me. Thanks, I wouldn't have got this idea if you hadn't shouted. Take rest. What are you doing here? Go sleep. What Guru? Relaxing listening to songs. - Yes. very nice, you too join. No relaxation in my life. I'll tell you a secret, don't tell anyone. - Tell me. I'm planning to escape tonight. - Why? That soul is torturing me, I feel like hiding elsewhere. Where ever you may go, soul will follow you. How can it come? Souls don't need tickets and passports. You're right. It's here, I'm coming. Who? - who else? My mummy. Mummy?- My soul. Till tomorrow morning it will play with me like a kid playing with ball. Why are you getting late? - Says urgent. Bye...bye... What? - What were you doing there? Why were you talking to humans? - Am I not a human? Don't I have a private life? You're too much, you wake me up at 5 am, and have drinks up to 3 am, I'm dying unable to serve you, my health is also deteriorating, I prefer death than life now. Die! Let's roam together. Why are you shocked? Basha, your drink. How could he see you? - He's also a soul. How many are here? - Roughly about 40 or 50. If you too join, it'll add one more. You'll go and sleep happily, right? - What else you want me to do? Come with, let's go to sleep. What?- I can't come, you go. Sleep. Looks like you both have become good friends. With him? No way. I'm waiting for an opportunity. He'll join you in short time. It's me Chari. - Tell me grandma. We are coming to Calcutta. - Tomorrow? Why are you coming here though it's my birthday? Have you ever celebrated birthday without us? Why don't you listen to me? Then do one thing. After getting down from flight, come to Kali temple. I'll be there hoodwinking these fools. What do you say? - Okay. Okay, cut the call. Going to Kalighat? Tell me. - Listen carefully. Isn't it wonderful? Hubby, look there! How handsome our son is. Why are you all shocked? How do I look? How you look? You look just like N.T. Rama Rao! Where is my fiancfi? - What's that? Fiancfi means Chandrakala. She has a gift for your birthday, she's waiting outside the temple. Outside? Why are you sitting here instead of visiting the temple? It seem you've a gift for me, what is it? Kiss? We are Brahmins, can we behave so cheaply? Kiss is not sin. - Is it? Then kiss me. I'm not in mood, come. - Come. That's him! Use your all talent, even body shouldn't be found. I must see happiness in my brother-in-law's eyes. Got it? Okay...no need to stress it. Why are you sitting here? Come, let's circumambulate the temple. We were waiting for you. - Come father. Why are you blocking our way, you donkeys? Move! Why is he brandishing a dagger? - Then I'll run! Don't worry, God is there! Somebody please save my son. Is it Chari or the other one? Did you see how he's beating up them, granny? Didn't I tell you about fight in pub? - Yes...yes... How come our boy is beating them? Is he eating non-vegetarian food? - Yes...yes... No...no... Is he my son or the other boy who looks like him? Yes...yes...no...no... You're saying yes and no, tell me yes or no. No...no... - Is he not my son? Yes...yes... - Kill me! Is he getting bashed up by our boys? No, he's bashing up our boys. - Is it? May be it's him. Don't know, I see only one here. Situation is very dangerous here. Have you paid the goons? No, I said payment after job is done. The escape now, you can save money. You said it right. My bad time! Mother! Mother, if he's that guy, then where is my son? Grandma! Father, it' not me. He's himself. Let's go. Wasn't it you who beat goons in the pub? What are you saying? Did you fall in love for the fight? Engagement is cancelled, grandma. - You keep quiet. Though he beat them, I fell in love with you only. Then, engagement stands. Let's go. Father, you go back home. Who are you? Why are you acting like me? Who sent you? Will you kill him? If he doesn't tell the truth, I'll kill him. Kill him, kill your own brother. What are you saying grandma? He's your brother. I separated you to save my family. You both are twins. Goddess Kali has united you on your birthday, the day I separated you both. You mean, is he not my son? Father, I'm your son only, wait. Why are you trapped with them? So I talked to your father on phone. Not mine but our father. - Then me? Father, you're also my father...wait. What shall we do now? - Not together, I'll do. Till now they used you in my place, I'll take your place and do what is to be done, and save our father. You'll go missing again, they will catch me, we'll all be trouble. Whatever it is, from now let's do it together. Let's use the advantage look alike personality. What do you say father? You calm down. That's the matter. - Okay. Let's go from here. What are you saying? - Yes aunty. Your second son too is alive. They will together bring uncle to you shortly. Separated family will reunite. You've give me good news, what can I give you? You've given your son, what else can be greater than it? My eyes see with you only... My legs run with you only... My lips will kiss you only... My heart will beat for you only... My imaginations are about you only... My story is with you only... My day night, joy _sorrow is with you only... If you like someone, how difficult it may be... It will unite me with you only... It there is shore, how far it may be... It will unite me with you... My wishes end with you... My desires end with you... You're my dance, song, hunt and way... How much ever beautiful I may be... If you refuse me, it's nothing... My beauty and body is all yours... If your heart doesn't fall in love... It's useless to be youth... Evenings are with you only... My fun is with you only... My pluses are with you only... I'm not with me, I'm with you only... Satellite controlled Stealth weapon you've been waiting for years is ready. You know how much risk I took and invested heavily, so if you make your offer. You can kill anyone in this world sitting at home with your laptop. Deal is okay on one condition. - What's the condition? They want the life of its designer. He mustn't design another one. In 48 hours, weapon and its designer will be at your service. It's unjust to kill the Major. Don't say it loud, he may kill you. What? - Dhanraj has escaped. I'm sure he'll go to Baba. - Then, we'll be in danger. So, follow my plan. - Tell me. Please don't shoot me. If anything happens to me, your father will die. Take this gun and kill me. Anyway you will kill me on knowing the truth in few days. Kill me now only. - What's the truth? I'm not Major's son Narasimha. Trust me, I'm his look alike Narasimhachari. I belong to a Brahmin neighbourhood. Meta and Basha lured me with money to act like him. You were worried about Major stopping the work... So I suggested about taking him. Though he's duplicate, your job is done, right? I came to know that I was cheating a gentleman. Gentleman? Who is he? - You! My grandma always said never cheat good men. That's also me, right? - Yes, you! That's why I told you the truth. Forgive me or punish me, the decision is yours. Who else knows this? Till now we knew and now you know. Lookmwhatever it may be. Till now you acted for them, now you continue it for me. Major must believe that you're his son till my job is done. I'll pay you Rs.1 crore. Why? We've already paid him heavily. Tell me what you want, we'll train him. - Get out! - No sir... I'll kill you - I'll go. I'm ready to do anything for you. I'll act like I too don't know you're not the real man. Let it be between us only, nobody must know it. How come you're hurt? - He did it. He kidnapped and tortured me. - That man? Why did that man kidnap you? - That man? He? Yes, he! Why did he kidnap you? To know the whereabouts of Major. - What did you tell him? Him? He! - Yes, he! What did you tell? - Ask him. How can he remember? He's absentminded. I forgot everything. - Look, he remembers that clearly. He hasn't forgotten anything, he's playing a drama. Tell me what did you tell him? I told him about the island's location. - Why did you tell him? Why? He too threatened to kill me, so I told him. What can he do knowing the place? He must know the password to get Major out. I told him bravely because it's in your laptop. Even if goes there, our men will kill him. He's here, how can he go there? He said if he goes there, why are you stretching it? Do onething, have drinks and take rest. What about him? He tortured me a lot. Look at me! Just a sorry for the hell I had been through. No problem, I'll say big sorry! Enough. Look how nicely he says sorry. Now go...go. I want to tell you truth. - What is it? Narasimha tortured you and Chari said sorry to you. Yes sir. They are two! - I too feel the same. Their slang is different. Not just slang, they are different people. Why didn't you tell me this earlier? My mummy told me not to tell this. Mummy? - It's an epic tale of soul. It has gone out for a stroll, let's tell Baba before it comes back. I've understood everything. - What have you understood? They are two different people. How do you know? - He told me. The man who kidnapped is different from the man who is here. You tell him. - Yes sir, they are two people. I'll kill you. Two? He's one man! He's here only. There's another one who isn't here. How can a man be there who isn't? - He's there sir. I came to tell you and got trapped here. So you say, two look alikes are there Thank God, you got it at last. Is their father same? - No. Same mother? - No, but same mother tongue. I'll pluck out your eyes. Fathers and mothers are different, how can they look same? They look same. - I won't believe it. You too don't believe it. Don't believe anything without proof. You want proof? Are you a judge? You're just a don, that's all. Even dons need proofs. If you've show me, I'll believe you. Proofs mean... Come...come... Entered safely, didn't face any problem, right? Everyone think it's you, how can I have any trouble? Okay, Baba is receiving cash in an hour, he'll open the laptop then. We must divert his attention when he opens it. What should I do for it? - Where is your girl friend? She's in Calcutta. - My girl friend is also here only. Why do we need them now? - I'll tell you. Tell me Peri Shastri. I've an important news for you. Can I tell on p[hone or personally? If you come, you'll also get trapped, tell me on phone. They are twins. The old woman changed them in hospital. I got information from our spies in the neighbourhood. This proof is enough to finish him. You hang up the phone. What again? Dhanraj and my Guru are spreading news that we are two people. If this news reaches Major's ears? You'll lose everything. Yes, I'm also feeling heaviness in chest. If I kill both of them, people may get wrong ideas. If you want to stop them, accept that we are two people. I'll not accept, how can I bring the real man now if he asks? No need to bring him, tell him we were twins. Tell them grandma separated us at birth. Then we'll both be major's children. Think about it. Then it doesn't matter whether it's you or him here. Is he also here? Good! You didn't believe me when I told they were two. But they are... - Two! You too know it? You need to know one more thing. They are twins. Grandma separated them at birth. ...Hospital! - Some hospital! So their fathers and mothers are same. Both are Major's sons. What's the difference if he's here or the other one? Come...come. I've a doubt, is Baba real? Don't raise new tensions, come. - Come. 50% money has reached my account. Your good time has started again. Looks like new trouble is here. How could you come in? Go out. - Call Narsi. Call! What's this nuisance? How are you Narsi? - Who are you? Have you forgotten me? I'm Nandu. Have they charmed you? - What's that nonsense? We never drink. - He'll get caught now. You couldn't do anything, so watch now. Who are you? - What bothers you? Who are you? Why are you here? What's this Narsi? - Hands off him. I'll put hands or legs on my boy friend, who are you to stop me? Boy friend? He's my fiancfi. I'll kill you. How dare you call my boy friend as your husband. Don't talk too much, I'll break your teeth. Shut up! - Shut up! What are you blabbering? - What are you blabbering? Shut up! Don't create a scene here, don't fight without knowing the truth. What's the truth? Come here.- Me? - Yes, come here. Come. What sir? Till now you were telling me a tale, tell them now. I can't look into her eyes and speak. I love her. Yes. Would you like to hear that story? I'll kill you right now. I don't want your love tale. Tell them the story of twins. Tell them! Chandu, what really had happened was... That's what had happened! After we get him, we'll send both of them. You go now. Nobody can go out after knowing the story. Those who know should be here only? - That's all. There's a party today evening, enjoy it. My heart is agitated like mixie... You're cool like chilled Pepsi... Your lips are like roses... Your waist is like jasmine twig... He's one man to others but for me two! Shattering! Salutations...salutations... my heart races on seeing you... Salutations...salutations... when a tiger is pouncing on me... You're my taxi to the dreamland... Be my lifelong partner... My mind blocked watching you part by part... Your eyes are never ending streams of desire... Don't enchant me with your sweet talk... If I get into mood, I'll kiss you hundred times... Your eyes are razor sharp... Your vision is prickly... Your bow like body... Your words are rhythms of violin... Your vision is electrifying... Your touch is thundering... Your hot waist has a cute twist... Like a rainbow in dark, it struck me... Man's ultimate power is in majestic moustache... It's pulling me into the runway of colourful love... Your sugary lips... Your rocking waist... Your outfit's hooks... Your face... Your craze... Your knock-out punch... Father...father... Poor boy! Got locked up? I shifted your father for safety. It helped me. Information to you. I'm going to kill your father tomorrow. I don't need that island anymore, the doors will never open again. You'll die inside without food and water. We must go out quickly. Where are you going, Chari? - Where will I go? These girls want a tour of the city. You'll go to see the city, your brother has gone to see island. What should I see then? Your father will die. Stand like this when your father comes tomorrow. You fix the target. Our target is on the bridge which is 12 kms away from here. It's right before your eyes. Show them! Sorry Major! I settled the deal with your life. I couldn't avoid it. How could he come out? The way he went inside, the same way he came out. That's logic! No...no...weapon will get destroyed. I'll send back your people, take them. Go...go away. How come they are two? - Both are your sons, twins. The will tell you the story later. Go...go... Don't fire, we'll get burnt. It will not work, he left the machine but took the trigger. Return the trigger. I'll give it to my son, if you've guts take it form him. Fools are always fighting! When will they reform? Killing a Brahmin is sin, you'll lose the other leg also. He doesn't care about sins. If you're alive, friendship would lose it' meaning. Hubby! Who is she? - Your mother. I had to introduce to your family. Please don't cry children. We are going to watch a film, take care of the children. Okay.- Bye Bhattu! - Okay Chandu. I should've married your mummy, I got caught with a mummy and my life turned into hell. My glass is empty! - Drink my blood. If you go on drink, it will get over. I'm dying unable to take care of you. I'm working for them, how much can I get for how long? From shop! - From shop? People have cat or dog as pets, but my pet is a soul.
