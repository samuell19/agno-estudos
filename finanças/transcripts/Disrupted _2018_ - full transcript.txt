When I was a kid, my mama had this dog. It was a little poodle named Sammy. He used to do all kind a tricks like walk on his hind legs, spin around in circles. You know, all that cute little poodle shit. Then one day my mama was walking him and she ran into this pit bull and it looked mean but she gave it the benefit of the doubt. She put her hand out to pet it and it growled at her. Well little Sammy, he wanted to protect her from that pit. So he started barking at it and that was all it took for that pit to put little Sammy on his back, wrap his jaw around his neck and kill him. Mama didn't do nothing about it. She thought maybe it was Sammy's fault. He shouldn't a barked. - Calvin? - Hi, Amy? - Hey. - Hey. You know, I forgot something inside. I'm just gonna run back in and you know what, you can go ahead. I'm just gonna catch another ride. Are you sure? I mean, it's all good. I don't mind waiting for you. I'm not in a hurry or anything. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. A couple of weeks passed. The pit did the same thing to her neighbor's cat and then to the laundromat owner's dog. Mama always felt guilty that she never warned nobody about pit. ♪ If one will stand up ♪ ♪ In the name ♪ ♪ Of the gun, of the gun ♪ ♪ In the eyes of a guilty man his work is done ♪ ♪ In the name ♪ You can't see me but I can see you, Patrick.

Where's my drone? Thanks, Alpha Nodrun Security. That's it? I like the fact that you're using drones as not only part of the problem but also the solution. Yeah. Cool. We think we can start with high end security for clients like celebrities. How far along is it? Ready for you to try a full-fledged demo. Do you think you guys could take a trip up to Tahoe? I've got a property up there on the lake, about 10 acres. Absolutely, thank you for the opportunity. Look, I get pitched about 30 phone apps a week. But as a venture capitalist, I find your technology to be refreshing. Well like the video says, it keeps people out. I'm not sure about the bears though. You know, Tahoe. Bears. Cabin. Thank you guys. - Thank you. - Thank you. I still need you to clean and to restock the bathrooms before you split. - Yes sir. - Okay. You taking a $15 an hour stroll? I got a Tom Cushing on the line in there for you. That's your probation officer, right? 97, that's how many days you got left not to violate and fuck up your parole. Yeah. A parolee starts missing meetings and showing up late for work, my mind starts to wonder that maybe I oughta to start mentioning some of this shit in my reports, you know, just to cover my ass. I don't think either one of us wants that, do we? Listen, I'm not gonna say anything if you don't. Just make sure your ass is at that meeting tonight, man. I gotta go. I'm Gary, I'm an alcoholic. Hey, Gary. The holidays are coming up. Crazy, right? Needless to say, the holidays are tough on me and I know a lot of you feel the same way and so let's just be especially there for one another right now. You know, I wouldn't make it through without you guys. Thank you. Thanks, Gary. Anyone else? Kyle? I don't really wanna talk about it. That's it. - Thanks, Kyle. - Thank you, Kyle. How about the birthday boy with his brand new six year chip? Hold up your chip, Pete, come on. - Say it, Pete. - Yeah, Pete. All right, I guess I'll go. My name's Pete and I'm an alcoholic. Hey Pete. I used to think drinking was my problem, then I met Gary and I quickly found out I was full of shit. Quickly? I think it took about a year, Pete. It turns out my issue was anger. Justified anger is the worst kind of anger for an alcoholic and I found that out the hard way, across the Bay in San Quentin. Which I do not recommend, by the way. Yo Pete, wait up. Hey, I wanna talk to you. I'm sorry, I gotta get to work. I thought you just came from work. Oh, you're still working at that bar? No wonder you've been missing meetings lately. Your PO know about this? You know, he called me this morning, asked about you and I gotta tell him the truth. I get it, it's not your fault. If you gotta tell him the truth, tell him the truth. I'm just letting you know I'm just trying to make the fucking rent this month, okay? You hang out in a barber shop long enough, you're bound to get a haircut, Pete. All right, you're right. Listen, I will give my notice soon, okay? All right, man. You do what you gotta do. - Hey, Fiona. - Pete. What are you doing here? What do you mean what am I doing here? You know I always work the dead shifts. Oh no, I didn't know that. I was actually pretty slammed about an hour ago. Oh by the way, thank you so much for switching shifts with me. I started teaching this killer hot yoga class on weeknights and Thursday's my only free night. Oh my god, do you take hot yoga? You, nevermind. What? What the fuck? Todd, you got a mistake here on the schedule. You've got Fiona on Thursday nights. That's my night. No, no, no, she's killing weeknights, man. Yeah well ever since you took weekends away from me, Thursday night's my only good night, it pays my bills. There's a thing called Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter. You know how to use those? Because I don't think you do. Fiona on the other hand, she's whip smart. She's kicking ass and she's promoting the hell out of us. It's like quadrupled our crowd. Now we're pouring $11 Moscow mules out of copper cups, man. I do not want to go back to Bud Light. Todd, I am social. You know me man, I keep the drinks pouring. All right guys, I am closing out here. Pete is going to take care of you for the rest of the night. Aren't you rent-controlled anyway? Yeah, for now. All right. Hey, I can do that. - Hi Susan. - Are you on your way home? Yeah. Ed and Karen are coming over for dinner tomorrow night and apparently Ed doesn't do California wines and that's all we have in the cellar. All right, what kind do you want? Why don't you pick up a nice fresh zin? Hi there, can I help you with something? You got a stain on your pants. What's up, blood? Homeboy's staring. Do the test, right there, right there. If you call the cops, they ain't gonna do nothing. I ain't got nothing on me. They show up and rescue me from beating your ass, I'll find you, I never forget a face, you hear me? You square ass "Modern Family" looking mother fucker. Hey, you hear me? What the fuck, man? What's your fucking problem? No, no, no. Motherfucking hella bubbly, bitch. Bam. Come on man. Are you over 21? Bitch, what you think? Yeah, I believe you. Why you celebrate? It's my lucky day. - You want box? - No, I'm good. Excuse me. Fucking Old Navy motherfucker. Gee , that paper from this morning. That old news by now. Yeah well, ever since I lost my cable, that's the only entertainment I have. It's free, take it. Don't worry about it. - Are you sure? - Yeah, yeah, take it. You don't have a smartphone, huh? A smartphone? No. And I intend to keep it that way. You have a good night Mr. Wong, thanks for the paper. Yeah, no problem, you too. Hey dad, sorry, I tried calling you at work but I must've just missed you. Todd said he sent you home early since it was slow. Anyway, just checking to make sure you're still coming to Oakland to see my show tomorrow. Also Sean wanted me to tell you that he thinks you should sell Big Blue, stop driving across the damn bridge and just move to Oakland with the rest of us. There's a few more things we wanted to go over for the wedding, so call me. 20, 30, 50, 60, 70. It was a shit night. Oh, what is he doing? Do it again, do it again. - Peter. - Hey Ned. I thought best to tell you in person. You're selling the building, I heard. Actually the building's sold. Oh. So I wanted to drop by and give you as much of a headstart as I could. I know how hard it is to find a new place to live. How soon are we talking here, Ned? You got a place to go? Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me. No, I wish I were, Peter. I'll have a relocation check for you asap. Come on, baby. That a girl. ♪ I'll always be there ♪ ♪ For you ♪ Thank you, thank you, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a very special guest in the house tonight. He's an Oakland native and he just so happens to be my dad all the way from San Francisco. Dad, come on up here. Sore throat. So dad. What do you want? True confession, I had an ulterior motive for asking you to join me on stage tonight. Not just to embarrass your father? I'd really like it if you sang a duet with me at the wedding. What, what are you, crazy? No, it's not crazy. It'll be amazing. I don't know, it's 150 people. And I'll never ask for anything from you ever again. We'll rehearse twice a week. I don't know, I haven't done anything like this in a long time, ever since- - She would want you to do it. Ah Jesus, okay. Really? Yes, but I'm not gonna dance. Fine but you're still coming to the party tomorrow night, right? Oh, you mean the pre-wedding party party? Yes, that's the party. All of my friends are gonna be there. They haven't seen you in years. I wouldn't miss it for the world. Nice, I'm dancing like a goddamn jabberwocky at the party. That's exactly why I'm gonna leave the dancing to you. - Cheers. - Cheers. To having a good time. So my offer still stands. If you want it to be a surprise for Natalie, I could teach you to dance. For real, no look, I don't know if you know this but you're white and so you may need my help. I think I'll pass, okay? But hey, listen. On a more serious note, I didn't want to say anything in front of Natalie. You're not dying, are you? Dying, what? No. Fuck no, what the fuck? No, I'm not dying. You can't hit me with that heavy shit. Ah shit dude, no. I saved up some money, I want to give you guys some money. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. My parents got this, bro. Natalie didn't tell you? Look okay, I know traditionally the father - of the bride is supposed to- - Go on. Pete. Hey look, your parents are great, okay? It's just ever since I got back in Natalie's life, it's been really hard to do that and I owe her so much, I owe you so much, I'm gonna owe you when I get older even more. No man look, we love you bro, we love you. - Come on, man. - I appreciate that. But I want you to take this money and maybe use it for a honeymoon or whatever, okay? All right. Thanks man. I really wish you still drank, bro. - Oh no, you don't. - What? No, you don't. I could drink you under the table. I'm sure you could but I'm gonna tell you right now, you don't even wanna see me try. - All right. - Thanks, Pete. A gruesome discovery has people in this quiet San Francisco neighborhood feeling a bit uneasy. Are you with me? Oh, Harry. Police were called to an alley off 40th Street at around 5:00 a.m. this morning- - Oh come on, Harry. - Discovered a body- - Hey, you're the one that set the quota for three times a week, not me. 33 year old Frederick Ross of Oakland. - I thought it was four? - Help out our investigators, please do contact the San Francisco Police Department. I know we are going through a drought but I feel like too bad, I am gonna take a 20 minute shower and I don't give a shit. The environmentalists can suck my dick. So talking about politics, I think tomorrow the editor- - Yeah, okay. If Philip from the Valley can't help end gun violence, I don't know who can. We can do anything we want. I said "Of course it's quiet, it's a fucking Tesla." This is a damn good zin. Where'd you say you got it from again? - France. - Yes. That's the last bottle right there. Oh no. You're just going to have to drink a little slower, Ed. Maybe that way you can actually savor it. ♪ Let it be the thing that I am ♪ Honey. Please unplug, we have company. That's okay, that is the society we live in now. We all have to update our status at all times. Well, Harold doesn't do social media. That's 'cause he's a grownup. Shut up Ed, you have a Facebook and a Twitter page. So why don't you do social media? I think it brings out the worst in humanity. How so? It makes everyone think they're special but deep down, everyone's just a troll. That's why people on the internet love anonymity because they can finally feel free to say whatever they want. - It's kinda like guns. - Harry. Guns and trolls, wow, this zin is incredible. It's taking us down a rabbit hole. People don't carry guns for protection. What they really want is for someone to give them the excuse to use it. Go on, burglarize my house. Let's see what happens. Snatch my purse. You make them pay the ultimate price just for fucking with the wrong person. That is everyone's fantasy, right? Tell us how you really feel, honey. You know, I want to propose a toast. To your Foundation from Silicon Valley to Washington DC, sensible gun law change is coming and it's all because of your generosity. At the end of the day, we all just want the world to be a safer place, right? Cheers. Sorry. Hello? Honey. Mind if I just check my phone? - I have to take this. - Please don't be long. I am sorry. And my last question, what is your name? Harold Price, June 23rd, 1963. And do any of the charges look suspicious to you or are they all occurring- - No, all of those charges are correct. Okay, thank you sir and your other account looks correct? - Yes, both accounts. - Okay, great. - So nothing looks suspicious? - No. Everything seems normal. Is there anything else we can help you with? No thank you. Harold, come on, we're ready to eat. Where are you? Harold, you're embarrassing me. Sweetheart, can you just apologize to Ed and Karen for me? Is that the garage door? Where are you going? We have company. - I told you to be back soon. - Honey, I'm sorry. I had to get to the office. Just please keep our guests happy. Keep the wine flowing. What am I supposed to do here by mys- - Credit? - Yeah. Chip card, just insert. You don't check ID? You have gray hair, you're over 21 I think. Have a good night. That your security camera? Why? Where do you keep the recordings to that? I'm Cinnamon, this is Crystal. What's your name? Harold. - I am so fucking wasted. - Fuck yeah, you are. - Boo yah. - How'd you get that- - Shh. - You're so odd. - Don't trip, baby. Harold ain't got no limits. You know what I'm saying? Come here, girl. Piece of shit. Hey box boy, how about you show me what they charge in prison? What are you doing here? You thirsty? So a guy gets beat to death with brass knuckles, so what? So what? Nobody uses brass knuckles. Well, almost nobody. It doesn't mean it's the same guy. I don't believe this. If I gave you this information six years ago, you would've gone batshit crazy. Yeah well, two years in prison will do that to do. Do what? Make you think twice about doing something stupid, like listening to you. That's not the only thing you did in prison. You hit that commissary every night, huh? What'd they give you, your last meal every fucking night? Suck my dick, Jack. I know I'm a fat fuck, okay? You and Catherine still in Petaluma? Oh yeah. God, it's great. Do you want to know what the highlight of my day is? I wake up every morning and I don't get a blow job from my wife and I usually take a shit about the size of the Transamerica Pyramid. But the highlight of my day is I go down to my local Starbucks and I watch my favorite barista frappe my 'cino and when she's doing it, I just grab a little glimpse of her perfect apple ass and then everything else goes downhill from there because that's what fucking happens when they give you early fucking retirement. I gotta tell ya, Pete, there's not a day that goes by that I don't think I wonder if this is the day I'm gonna take my Glock and blow my fucking brains out from boredom. Jack, what are you doing here? Obviously I don't have any money to give you. I mean you're wasting your time. Money? Pete, if I wanted money, I wouldn't be looking for clients next to a dumpster, no offense. I still have connections in the LPD. What's that? That is a list of Fred Ross' known associates. Who the fuck is Fred Ross? Who the fuck is Fred Ross? The drug dealer who got his head bashed in with brass knuckles, now maybe the murder was personal. Maybe someone on this list is your guy, Pete. Why would he resurface 25 years later? Do you watch the news? Are you watching what's happening in the world today? Everybody hates everybody, Pete. Everybody's mad about everything. There's road rage and Twitter wars. It's not hunky-dory like it used to be, it's not. And beyond that, this is for Sharry. Now you said she deserved this. This mother fucker deserves the death penalty and we're gonna give it to him. Just like last time, huh? Okay, you accidentally sent the wrong guy into a coma for a couple days. Five days, Jack. Five days he was in a coma but you want to go ahead and tell yourself that so you can sleep at night, fine, kudos to you. For me, it wasn't worth it. It got you sober. Don't give me that silver lining bullshit. Hey, hey, Natalie's getting married in a month. No shit. I'll bet I wasn't invited, I'll send a toaster. I'm sorry Pete, I don't know why I'm being a fucking asshole, especially about that. I'll bet she's beautiful just like her mom, huh? Please give her my congratulations all around. Yeah okay, thanks. Hey listen, you know, I should be going anyway. Hey. Even a broken clock is right twice a day. Pete. It wasn't your fault. ♪ And you go strong and true ♪ ♪ Baby blue ♪ ♪ Eyes ♪ Good girl. ♪ Are always shining on you ♪ Thanks, I've got tapes for sale. Buy me a beer and I'll give you a discount. This is about as dead as I've ever seen in this place. Look at this fucking place. Next week man, better flyers. There's not gonna be a next week. - It's just a check. - Just a check for 15 G's. Kicking you out, huh? Yeah. Man, like I said, you're more than welcome to stay with Natalie and I. They're gonna have to drag me outta here kicking and screaming. You know what? Maybe you should talk to Natalie before you think about moving in with us. At first, I didn't even know it was him. Almost nothing left of his face. As I said, it was something metal that killed him like brass knuckles or something like that. He lived in San Francisco for his whole life and he work here for 40 years. Who would do this? A drug dealer, an Asian liquor store owner. The only thing these two guys have in common is somebody smashed in their faces. I don't know, it might be nothing but Mr. Wong's nephew said- - There's no security footage at all, you know why? The son of a bitch stole the security cameras. It's all gone. It's a dead end for us, buddy. Thanks. Ah, fuck it. Hey Harry, can I get the email addresses of the donors we're meeting this weekend? I called but the guy's wife is real judgy. You know, one of those artsy trophy wives. - Phil? - Yeah, Phil. She's probably bitter that she couldn't put that $200,000 arts degree to use. It reminds me how grateful I am that I transferred over to marketing. You definitely dodged that bullet. I thought you said you didn't like anal. What are you talking about? The charges on your credit card, Harry, I saw them. Porn and strippers, really? It was a bachelor party. Sure it was. We're starting therapy again. I'm calling Dr. Berberich first thing in the morning. That's really not necessary. Yes, it is. You know, if I could strap a GPS to your dick, I would do that too. How soon are you looking to move? Soon. Yeah, real soon. So on the phone, you said it was 1650. Is there any wiggle room in there? 2650. Jesus. - What's the deposit? - 3500. So you want 6150 to move in here? It's a remodel, notice the granite countertop? Yeah. I'll be in touch. - Want an application? - Suck my dick. I would totally pick you up but people are gonna start arriving any minute and I'm not done cleaning yet. Sean doesn't get home 'til 5:30. Yeah no, listen, I'll just take the bus. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's ridiculous. I'm gonna call you an Uber. Oh honey, don't waste your money. Too late, the driver is en route. His name is Trevor, he's in a silver Prius. Really, that's it? That's it, welcome to the 21st century. I have a feeling you're gonna be hooked. Yo. Trevor? Anyway, so here I am about to be officially homeless. Not even Oakland is affordable anymore. I'm gonna have to ask my daughter if I can crash at her place for awhile. So is that what they call gentrification? Urban renewal, racial dislocation. I thought that shit only happened to black people, man. That's shit's crazy. Yeah well, my bills don't see color apparently. - That's rough. - What about you? What's your story? Born and raised in Oakland just like you, except if I came up in the public housing zone, you know? Same as any other ghetto though, you know what I'm saying? Crime, crack, drugs, prostitution, all out in the open and shit, man. I was like this ain't no way to live, man, so I got my act together, got me a little degree online. I'm just doing this little driving thing right now, man. You know, just trying to pay back these student loans. I'm just grinding, man. You and me both, huh? I'll tell you, a lot of people out there got it easy compared us. You know what I'm saying? That's one way to look at it, man, but you know, it's about perspective though. Remember what Teddy Roosevelt said, right? No, what'd he say? He said "Comparison is the thief of joy." Right? That's some motivational therapy for you. Hey man, you ain't got nowhere to be. I mean like right this second, right? You mind if I pick up my cousin right quick, man? He gonna be coming up over here on the right. - Yeah sure, I guess. - Right on, man. Appreciate it, man. Do you mind? Hey, hey, hey. This isn't the way. Oh shit. Target's gonna be a black male, - 30, gray hoodie. - Damn boy. Under a flannel. I ain't no diamond tester but to me man, that shit look realer than a motherfucker. What the fuck you rolling around with a diamond ring in your pocket for, Pete? It's my wife's, she's dead. She won't me missing it then, huh? Asshole. Are you serious right now? Everything's about you. We just went to your fucking one man show. You don't wanna go, you don't have to go. - No, that's not what I mean. - No, fuck it. What are you? I thought you quit. Slow down, please. You know I hate it when you drive like that. Get off that car's back. It's just a cigarette, Jesus. No, it's not just a cigarette. Why don't you just grow the fuck up? - What are you doing? - What does it look like? I don't know, behave like a fucking man and not feel like such a victim all the fucking time. What are you? Pete. What are you doing? Look, just take the baby home. I am sick and tired of being strung along in your life dream. What about my life? I'm done. Man, get him the fuck up out this car and let's roll, man. Make that nigga seasick while you at it. Get your fat ass out the car. You ain't got no more money tucked, do you? What's this? - Speak up, fool. - What it looks like. - Are you a cop, Pete? - A cop? Far from it. Cuz, check this out bro. If you ain't no cop, what you're doing with these files, Pete? Trying to find the guy that killed my wife. And you think one of the names here is the person that killed your wife, huh? Probably not. But maybe one of those guys know who did. What if I told you I know one of the names on here? What if I told you I might be able to help you? I'd say you've got my attention. Yeah, but what you got for me? Pete, come on, man. You rolling around with diamond rings, envelopes full of cash and shit. I'm sure you got something more, man. I got a Volvo. You know how to drive stick? This whip is perfect, ain't it? For what? Man, when are you gonna introduce me to your friend? Didn't I say I would do it? Let me ask you something. You ever wore glasses before, Pete? Man, what's up, man? That nigga's truck right there. What's up with this fool Sherm, man? I don't know, he probably up there catching VD. I assume this Sherm is one of the names on our list? You gonna have to season them questions a little bit more moderately, you feel me? Sherm get in this car and you start asking him all them questions, man, he gonna think you some kinda narc or something, man. He ain't gonna tell you shit. Not to mentioned it might get you capped. And that shit's real. And what exactly is this job? Don't trip, all right? It's just some petty larceny, that's all we doing. I'm gonna ask you to drive the Bronco for me. Doesn't sound like part of the original deal to me. Is this all part of the Prius gammick too? - This music. - What about it? It doesn't really seem like you'd be, you know, the type of fucking guy that would listen to shit like this. Fuck, I'll keep it 1,000 with you, boy. What type of cars you be seeing punk ass white people driving nowadays? Prius's, Leafs. Ever since I got this shit, man, the police ain't fucked with a nigger, man. It's true, ever since he got the Prius, he ain't never been stopped by the police. Then I went like this, I was like well fuck it, man. I'm a go all the way in, you feel me? I got me some fucking thick ass fucking glasses, some tiny shirts and tiny jeans, nigga. Took this bitch, put a fucking Key Tahoe blue sticker on the back and shit. White folks be loving some blue ass licks. Don't they? Them mother fucks will jump off bridges on they birthday for that bullshit. Then I was like all right nigga, I got my little outfit, you feel me? Now a nigga needs some theme music. So I said all right, what's the whitest fucking music you ain't never gonna hear some niggas from Oakland playing when they riding around? Heavy metal, nigga. When it hit me, nigga, shit man, I started going into the archives, like what music can I find? That's when I get my Matt Pinfield on, you feel me? You know what was crazy? I started actually liking that shit, bro. Like early Judas Priest and fucking Slayer, some Black Sabbath, man. I even like some shit by White Pride, man and I started going to their concerts and all that shit. We went with these little white broads, man. They took niggas down to this fucking Lyles Rockney show. We was all in the mosh pit and shit, boy. We were fucking stomping on these white boys heads and shit. Mother fucker jumped up, he was like "Fuck yeah bro, do that shit, man." I felt like I discovered another part of myself in there. Like a spiritual part, you feel me? That's real. You look like you're ready to take it up a notch, right Harold? 'Cause I was thinking we could go out to my car. What, you don't know? You know, you know. Yeah, let's do it. Sherm. Shit. Yo baby, Harold's gotta roll. I've been texting your ass for 30 minutes. Hey yo Jay, can you switch the music to something more chill? Like Dave Matthews or something? What? Man, fuck Dave Matthews. That mother fucker be playing eight minute solos and shit. You sitting in the stadium, your ass will fucking fall asleep. I fucking like Dave Matthews. Do I know you? No. I feel like I've seen you somewhere. That's the tweak, nigga. Pointillism, y'all. That's all we in it for, pointillism. - Say what? - Pointillism. You don't know what that is? Take an art history lesson, nigga, damn. When we get up in this spot, don't touch shit up on this real estate. We don't need no cash, we don't need no jewels. All we looking for is these two George Seurat paintings from the French Impressionist Era. Pointillism is the style that they credit him with that he came up with because he would use these tiny paint dots to create his masterpieces. He revolutionized the game, man. I thought you said this was big, homes. It is big, fool. Fuck you think we doing? I don't need no fucking art. I just hit the jackpot with this rich motherfucker's plastic I stole. Got some ladies, some mother fucking champagne. You drank it all and them bitches ain't even here, right? See when the dollar collapses and the Fed calls in the country's debt and quits printing big faces, man, everybody's gonna want to have put their money into some shit that actually holds some value, man. Like some fine art, some land, some water or some shit, man. Can't do no shit with no fucking strippers and credit cards. Alright, Wall Street. As long as I get my 20%. What the fuck you keep staring at, old man? I finally figured out where you know me from. Oh yeah, where's that? Ross, you know me through Fred Ross. The liquor store, that's how I know your ass. You bumped into me at the liquor store. - Yeah, I don't think so. - No, it happened. Jay, how do you know this motherfucker, man? I'm not liking this shit right now. Nigga, shut the fuck up. This ain't no competition, it's a cooperation, man. He the driver, that's why he here. That's all your white ass need to know. I'm a make it simple for you, Pete. Text me on this phone after you make sure that there ain't no house sitter up in here or some shit. We gonna come through in the Prius. We gonna come out with the shit two minutes later. You gonna call me and slowly drive us up to the Prius. Prez gonna be parked up like a mile away. Then from there, you leave. We don't have no contact for at least a week, got it? All right, I got it. Y'all got two minutes. Fuck this, I'm calling Natalie. How the fuck do you dial on this phone? I'm not liking this. There's somebody breaking in on Starks. - Let's go. - Let's fucking go, fucker. I'm trying! It won't start. Come pick us up near the car. Man, hurry up! Man, let's go, come on, come on. Fuck man. I'm bleeding out, Jay, this look bad to you, man? I ain't no fucking doctor. How the fuck I'm supposed to know? You gotta get me to a hospital. Drop me off at Highland. What's the plan? The cops gonna think the Volvo was stolen anyway. So we ain't gotta trip on that. The only thing I'm worried about is this whip right here. You fucking hear me? We gotta get me to a hospital. Highland's 10 minutes from here. Shut the fuck up, you trigger-happy mother fucker. We go to Highland, we all go down. I'm a fucking kill you when this is done. That's right, look away you fucking bald fat piece of shit. This is all your fucking fault. Tell you what? Why don't you fucking try it, huh? I'll fucking crack your skull open Just like I did your little buddy Fred Ross. - You didn't kill Fred Ross. - The hell I didn't. Dude in the Tesla killed Ross and you ain't driving no Tesla. What? What'd you say? Sherm? I know this white boy didn't just die in my car. That's not good. What can I get you? How long ago did my friend Harold leave? Who? Thank you. He's been gone about 45 minutes but he's probably out back. Which is his car? He has a Dave Matthews sticker on the back, you can't miss it. Code 187, Code 187. Code 187, requesting an ambulance. All units be on the lookout for two white males, one aged 50 to 60, the other 20 to 30. I left with that fool. Everybody up in there seen that shit. We got a dead white woman on our hands, man. You know what that shit means. Give me one of his cigarettes. I thought you quit. I can hide his car. What you offering? Give me my ring back and I'll stash the car. - Where? - I got a buddy in Petaluma. I can stash it there. We got a deal? Please pick up. Hi, you've reached Natalie, you know the drill. Pete, what the fuck are you wearing? I like your look. Some kind of hipster. Is that what you call that? Well then, I'm gonna take my tea and head upstairs. Okay, hon. Goodnight. Hey Peter. You know in the course of my career, I've been on, fuck, 5,000 crime scenes. So little details, they're not lost on me. Like when a guy show up at my house with blood under his fingernails. What the fuck are you doing here in my house? Is there a place I could have a cigarette? I thought you quit that too. No, you can't smoke in here. She'll have a nervous breakdown, let's go outside. You know it's leaking oil, right? What the hell is this? Get the hell out, look at that. Look, it's one of those tracking devices. What's it for? Usually you see these from some spouse think's the other one's fucking around on 'em and they put it up under the car. I can't imagine why a tweaker would have it though. The cops can't use 'em, the judges don't allow it. It's weird. Pete, what is the matter? I really fucked up. You gotta help me out of this shit. Shh, you're gonna fucking wake her up. Listen to me Peter, nobody is gonna care that he's gone. Nobody, the world's a better place without him. That said, did you get any information before he went bye bye? He said the guy that murdered Fred Ross was driving a Tesla, you know, one of those electric cars. But I mean he was dying, man. He wasn't making a lot of sense. Listen to me, you called me this morning and I called my buddies at the Department. Would you believe that when Wong got killed, some hipsters in the neighborhood had a fucking drone in the air? They caught it, now they sent me the footage from downtown. You can't see the perp's face but I'm pretty sure it's a Tesla. Let me just go pull it up on the computer. You know what? Trying being Superman for awhile and not Clark Kent. Finish your cig and then come inside. Hey dude, I got it, check this out. Jack. Jack, what's going on? Come and find me. Why don't you go home, man? Just sleep this one off. Why don't you give me some good shifts, Todd? While you're at it, why don't you give me a whiskey too or have your little social bitch give me a bottle. What the fuck is wrong with you, Pete? Hey, hey, let's cut him some slack. Obviously he's had a rough day, right? I guess the bigger they are, the harder they fall, off the wagon, that is. Natalie, hey, it's me. Yeah, he's here. Do you mind picking him up? How long we gotta sit in here? We doing something with the Prius? No, we'll be hiding in plain sight. Unless you've got a better idea. Cuz, go pack your ski clothes, we goin' to Tahoe. Where are the restrooms? This beet juice is kicking in again. You ever had 12 ounces of beet juice? Dad wake up, it's time to go. Pete. Natalie, Natalie. Natalie. Look what I got ya. What the fuck is that? It's hers, I saved it for you. How drunk are you? I'm sorry. To think I was worried about you when you didn't show up to the party, I should have known better. Natalie, listen to me, I saw him. You're not making any sense. The man that killed your mother. This is what you want to go back to? Well I'm not gonna stop you. - I'm done. - Natalie, listen to me. I know what happened that night. Everyone always said it was your fault. You were the one driving the car, not her and you left her there. She was a sitting duck and you left her alone. You don't know what you're talking about, so you shut the fuck up. Don't pretend this whole sober charade you've been putting on for the last six years erases any of that. And don't come to my wedding. Hey, do you have a cigarette I can bum off you? - Sorry, this is my last one. - I got a fresh pack. Thank you. Here you go. You really shouldn't smoke. It's dangerous. Pete, where's Natalie, man? I've been trying to get ahold of her, where is she? Oh Sean, oh man. It's 5:00 in the morning, Pete but tell me where Natalie is, please. I've been trying to look for her, where is she? She got mad at me and she left the bar. Shit, man. I gotta go, man. Oh shit. We gotta call the cops. What the fuck is this guy doing? Shit. It's fine Natalie, don't worry. Mommy's got this. Everything's just fine. Shit. Sharry, really, what the fuck? And the baby's alone. Great, I need to put the fucker down, right? Sharry? Sharry? Sharry? Man, wake your ass up. Where am I? Don't worry about where the fuck you at, boy. Originally I was gonna leave your fat ass down the road somewhere, slumped, nigger. It's your lucky day, Pete. 'Cause of you, I got me a good luck charm. A motherfucking black card, endless flow of credit. It's not really a good time for me to be taking a road trip. Mother fucker, this ain't no fucking road trip. Put that shit on. You gonna help us rob this Harold Price. Not getting my ass shot for your dumb ass. Part-owner of some big ass companies. I'll tell you, Harold Price got so much motherfucking money, he don't even know what to do with it. Nigga got more money than God. That's why he got a place in Maui, LA, New York and this lakefront property right here in Tahoe. Do you know Steph Curry? No. Do you know Steph Curry? No. But aren't you guys professional basketball players? Lacrosse. You fucking kidding me right now? I don't need no art, I just hit the jackpot with this rich mother fucker's plastic I stole. Got me some ladies, some motherfucking champagne. I got me a good luck charm. As I said, there was something metal like brass knuckles. Killed Fred Ross was driving a Tesla. I saw the man that killed that your mother- - Mother fucker look like he just seen a ghost. Let's just get this over with. Hell yeah, I'm feeling good about this one, boy. - There's no cars there. - What about the garage? Okay, let me see. Come on, nigga. This ain't no time for no flying lesson. I thought you knew how to work this shit. It won't let me fly over the property for some reason. Didn't you say this drone had range of over a mile? It does but it won't let me. Hon? What? I'm getting ready. You want to go to Tahoe instead? - Damn. - Ooh, boy. You sure they're gone for the weekend? Hell yeah, the website said they had a fundraiser in DC all weekend, we good. Damn, them white folks weren't lying. This lake is blue as fuck. We have a fundraiser with Karen and Ed in DC, remember? Something more important came up. What? You. What is this for? Happy early anniversary, baby. I am gonna go pack. Hey Pete, you good? Keep doing your thing, man. You're our white alibi this trip. I don't trust your ass, man. So we gonna bounce or what? Might as well, we ain't got shit else to do here. Hold on. Is that a hot tub? White people. You mean rich white people, don't get it twisted. Man, I could get used to living like this. What you mean, used to living like what? Living like white people, you know? Wine tasting, going in a hot air balloon. Shit like that, man. You can do all that shit, man. You ain't gotta be white to do that shit. Just look at Pete, man. The shit he's told you about his life. The shit he going through right now. You think he got hot air balloons, spa treatments every day? He ain't got shit. Oh shit. Oh no. Prez? Prez? I guess you didn't need to bring your golf clubs after all. Prez, Prez, pull your shit up. Come on nigga, they home. Look at that, why are all the lights on? Might be part of the new security system they installed yesterday. Prez. Come on, they home. Holy shit, the paintings. Harold, we've been robbed. - We sure have. - Harold. Come on, what are you stopping for? Man, come on. I'm staying here. Why don't you go upstairs, see if your jewelry's still here. Do you think they took my jewelry? And if they did, we'll replace that too. Sweetheart, while you're up there, why don't you freshen up? We're not gonna let this ruin our romantic weekend. I just feel so fucking violated. Oh shit. Where's your shirt? That sink exploded on me. What was that noise? It was air in the pipes in that bathroom, it's horrible. It's all gone. My pearls, diamonds, everything. Something tells me we're gonna get them back real soon. I know, I know it can be replaced, it's just do you think the thieves are still around here? No, no one would hang around. Come on, keys, keys. Shit man, I must've left 'em inside. I'm gonna put a roast in the oven and in a couple hours we're gonna have a nice meal and we're gonna shake all this off. Why don't you take a nice hot shower? What the fuck is wrong with you? It's him. He killed my wife. He killed my daughter. Pete, you knew this shit the whole goddamn time and you didn't fucking say nothing? I oughta kill your ass my goddamn self. You led us straight to the goddamn devil's lair. No, you led us here. Listen man, it's two against one. We in this shit together now. Hey listen, you distract 'em. I'm gonna go get my gun. They must be upstairs. - Sherman? - No. - Where's Sherman? - Pete, he's down here! I hope you enjoyed yourself on my dime. - Get out. - Oh my god. Get out. Where'd that ring come from? My husband gave it to me. You can have it. Did he kill her? - What? - My daughter, did he kill her? There must be some kind of mistake. My husband, he's just a venture capitalist. Is it everything you imagined, Pete? Harry, you know him? He's just looking for his daughter. Please tell him you don't know where she is. Where's Natalie? Well you're her dad, you tell me. Fuck you. You took that ring from her. No, she gave that to me at that bar where you work at. She traded it actually for a cigarette. Don't you fucking lie to me, Natalie would never do that. Sometimes people just need a shoulder to cry on and she certainly never had yours. What the fuck are you talking about, Harold? Will you tell him the truth? Tell him that you don't know where she is. Should I tell him that I don't know where she is or should I tell him the truth? After all, it was you who was driving the car that night, wasn't it, macho man? Yeah, that's who you are. You ever put on a pair of these? Nevermind, I can tell the answer's no. You'd a been real proud of Natalie. She was a very tough girl. She didn't scream nearly as much as her mom did. 29 years and it all comes down to that. How does that make you feel? Deflated? You should have taken my advice, Pete. You crossed a line that now cannot be uncrossed. Here. Hello? Hello? Just some fucking blocked number, probably another robocall. You killed my wife for something that happened 30 years ago. That makes you worse than me. Nobody deserves what you did. Sure, but I gave your wife the chance to apologize for your bad behavior and it just didn't take. Now your daughter on the other hand, now she is talented. I'm going to invest in her singing career. I'm gonna be her first big break. When I was a kid, my mama had this dog, it was a little poodle named Sammy. She loved that dog, right? He used to do all kind a tricks like walk on his hind legs, spin around in circles. You know, all that cute little poodle shit. Then one day my mama was walking him and she ran into this pit bull. It looked mean but she gave it the benefit of the doubt and she put her hand out to pet it and it growled at her. Well little Sammy, he wanted to protect her from that pit. So he started barking at it and that was all it took for that pit to put little Sammy on his back, wrap his jaw around his neck and kill him. Mama didn't do nothing about it. She thought maybe it was Sammy's fault. He shouldn't have barked. Is this it? Yeah, that's him right there. Hey man, you're the groom? Congratulations. One day my neighbor's pit bull came up missing. We came out front, calling his name, yelling down the street. Everybody was so concerned about this pit bull not 'cause they felt bad for the neighbor but really they didn't want that dog wreaking any more havoc on anybody in the neighborhood. What they didn't know is I had to put that dog down myself. ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ I leave what's wrong ♪ ♪ 'Cause I've seen down into the night ♪ ♪ No point to resist, no other fight ♪ ♪ From days to years ♪ ♪ Just passing by ♪ ♪ We lost our tension, lost the light ♪ ♪ Across the ocean of our lies ♪ ♪ You know what's wrong to be with you ♪ ♪ I never felt you wanted to ♪ ♪ Like all those bodies we have found ♪ ♪ Like a summer without sun ♪ ♪ You know what's wrong to be with you ♪ ♪ I never felt you wanted to ♪ ♪ Like all those bodies we have found ♪ ♪ Like a summer without sun ♪ ♪ Oh sweetheart ♪ ♪ Let's contemplate ♪ ♪ Forget your anger, drop the hate ♪ ♪ We're still the masters of our fate ♪ ♪ Today feels wrong ♪ ♪ Tomorrow we'll be on our own ♪ ♪ Everlasting game, no we'll never won ♪ ♪ Now it's just you and me apart ♪ ♪ Each other weaves a broken heart ♪ ♪ You know what's wrong to be with you ♪ ♪ I never felt you wanted to ♪ ♪ Like all those bodies we have found ♪ ♪ Like a summer without sun ♪ ♪ You know what's wrong to be with you ♪ ♪ I never felt you wanted to ♪ ♪ Like all those bodies we have found ♪ ♪ Like a summer without sun ♪
