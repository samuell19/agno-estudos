(dramatic music) - [Narrator] God spoke at many times and in many different ways to our fathers through the prophets, telling them little by little about His plan. But now in these days, He has spoken to us through His Son, to whom He has given everything, and through whom He made the world and its ages. Solomon, one of the men of old through whom God spoke, tried to taste the knowledge and the pleasures of the world and found vanity of vanities, all is vanity. How many of us today are like Solomon, tasting the knowledge and the pleasures of this world, power, sex, fame, relying on possessions and self-righteousness? How long will God have patience with us before He does something drastic to get our attention? Solomon with mere human wisdom looked out on the world and observed that generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever. The sun rises and the sun sets, as it goes panting back to where it rose. The wind blows south and north, here and there, twisting back and forth, and getting nowhere. (gunshots firing) (dramatic music) (mountain lion growls) (mountain lion screams) And Solomon noticed that the same fate overtakes the wise man and the fool. Alas, like the fool, a wise man must also die. Men are no better than beasts, for men and animals breathe the same air, and both die. All go to one place, the dust from which they came. And I know this, that whatever God does is final. (majestic music) (calm music) - [Michael] But mom, Jimmy's going, why can't I? - Michael, I don't care what Jimmy's going to do. I'm not Jimmy's mother. You're not going to any survival camp where they allow a 12-year-old to go tromping through a desert filled with snakes and lizards and all-- - Oh mom, there's snakes and lizards in Minnesota. I survived last year. - Michael, I don't care to discuss this with you now. I'm busy. - But mom, I gotta know tonight. Tomorrow is too late. - Michael, what did I just get through telling you? - But mom, you just can't do this. Only five of us qualified, and you want me to go to a stupid family reunion. - Now look, you're going on the trip to San Diego with your father and your sister and me tomorrow. And one more word out of you and you're going to be grounded for one month. - Debbie, tell mom I'm not a baby anymore. - Michael, mom said no. - Debbie, you're a traitor. - [Carol] Well Debbie, thank you. Do I owe this respect to your new-found religion? (apprehensive music) - [Narrator] The Bible says that because sentenced against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. (concerned music) - "A word of caution. "The desert is beautiful and deadly. "Danger is always present "once you leave well-traveled roads. "Not only strangers and sightseers found this to be true, "but many Southwesterners have suffered the consequences." Are you listening? - Yeah. - "Travel in the desert can be an enjoyable experience, "but it can also be a fatal or near-fatal nightmare." Sounds like mom was doing you a favor. - Yeah, but Debbie, she treats me like a baby. If I sneeze, it's, "Mike, put your shirt on. "Mike, your nose is running." - Mike, come on, it's not as bad as all that. - [Narrator] And Solomon also noticed that even the wisest man who says he knows everything doesn't. - Billy, I forgot more about law enforcement than you'll ever know. Experience is what tells you to watch your step. It's what you get if you don't. - Hank, you're behind the times. Today we use computers and Jeeps and choppers. This isn't the Old West anymore. I'm telling you this for your own good, Hank. You'll soon be the laughingstock to this county. Now I spent four years studying law enforcement and training at the police academy. - Don't mean you know how to blow your nose. - Henry! Dwayne McGraw's laying up on Red Rock Road dead. He's been mauled by a bear or a cat. - What? I was just over at his place last night, found a steer had been killed, said he thought a cat done it. That just don't seem possible. - Hank. What do you make of this? Why the live shells? (gunshot fires) (airplane rumbling) - Hey listen, I'll see you in a few minutes, all right? - [Man] Okay, fine, yeah. (people chattering) (phone rings) - [Michael] Hello? - [Dave] Hi, Mike. - Hi, Dave. - Hey, how you doing? You all set to fly tomorrow? - I wanted to go to camp, but mom and Debbie wanna show me off to all our relatives. Hey, maybe you could tell-- - Oh no you don't. Don't get me in on this or we'll both be in trouble. Is Debbie there? - Debbie, Dave's on the phone. But really, Dave, mom and dad will listen to you. - [Dave] You better do as your mom and dad say. - Yeah. - Don't you think? - I guess so. Here's Debbie. - Hi, stranger. Welcome home. - Thanks, it's good to be home. Say, I have these three stewardesses who have offered to take me out to dinner, and I told them if you were busy I'd go. - David, come on. - Are you busy? - Well David, as a matter of fact, I'm not busy. - Aw, shucks. How would you like to go out with me tonight? - Well that depends. Last time we went out you told everybody I was your aunt. - Oh. (laughs) No, I won't do that. Tonight, you can be my sister. (ominous music) - [Billy] Hank, you okay? You look pale. - Yeah, I'm all right. Come charging through the brush with all the grace of a bull moose. Is that what they teach you kids at the academy? - Hank, if that cat should happen to attack you, you just tell them what a great law man you are. By the time you're finished, he will have died of old age. - Look, we gotta get a posse, organize a hunt. - That'll take the rest of the day. - Just how long do you think it'll take if we walk? - Hey look honey, I gotta go, I have a meeting. How about if I pick you up tonight about nine o'clock? (foreboding music) (cougar yowling) (gunshot fires) (cougar growls) - I don't know. The ideology that mom and dad have embraced all their lives is so obviously materialistic. It's just difficult to conceive of them understanding what I've found. I don't know. I guess they're kind of like-- - They're just like you were, huh? - [Debbie] That bad? - Oh, you were stuck on yourself when we first met. - Oh, you know, I thought a big university was where it was at, education and status on campus. But when I accepted Christ, I discovered that important as it is, an education alone is not the whole scene. And then you, big boy, big hotshot pilot and your classic line, "Your trouble is, Debra, "that you have the basis for knowledge, "but you lack wisdom." Boy that took a lot of nerve. - We didn't like each other much then, did we. - [Debbie] I guess not. - Here I was, perfect, and you were a spoiled little rich girl who needed a good spanking, and I hit you right where it did the most good, right in the pride. - Well, be patient. The Lord's not done with me yet. Soon maybe I'll be as perfect as you and get my wings. - Omaha Tower, this is bonanza six-niner whiskey ready for takeoff. - [Man On Radio] Bonanza six-niner whiskey, clear to take off on runway one four right. - [David] Bonanza six nine whiskey. - This is a nice airplane. How do you make it pay? - Well it belongs to a group of Christian airline pilots. We furnish the plane to Christians and the Lord's work just for the operating cost. - [Howard] You don't make any money doing that. - [David] When you do something for the Lord, he supplies the need. - [Howard] I wish he'd supply a couple of so-called Christians who owe me money. (airplane roaring) (breathtaking music) - You just never give up, do you, Mike? - Survival, huh? I'll tell you how to survive, Mike. Do unto others before they do unto you. - You can't say that, Howard. - Oh I was just being smart. What time do you think we'll get there? - Oh, about six o'clock I'd say. - We had a bear shot here a few years ago. Jake, you remember, shot by some fool hunter, only wounded, bullet lines at the base of its brain. Caused that animal so much pain he went crazy, become a killer. Now if that's what we've got here, and if that cat is alive, men, we gotta find it. - [Billy] Hank? - Yeah? - Where do you keep the coffee supply? - Well I don't know what could be easier to find. It's in the back room on a shelf in a cocoa tin. Marked magic. - Listen, Hank, any animal that's cornered is gonna fight. What makes you think this cat's any different? Could be dead. - I heard Dwayne fired eight shots in that cat. He couldn't have missed all those times. - Now you listen. Dwayne fired four times. He was so blame scared, the rest of the time he just ejected live shells out on the ground. That means that cat was still alive after the first four shots were fired, still able to kill. He might be able to do it again. - Are we on schedule? - We'll have Santa Fe 10 minutes late, but we'll make it up. - Are we gonna fly over the Superstition Mountains? - Are you superstitious, Mike? - Well I would be if I was in those mountains. People who go in there looking for gold never come out. - Did you read that in your survival manual, Mike? - It's true. - A lot of people have disappeared in those mountains. That's a fact. It could be the greed that causes men to go in there makes them turn against each other. - Do we have to fly over those mountains? - The Lord will protect us. - Well just the same, I don't wanna take any chances. - How much gold do you think there is in those mountains, Dave? - In the lost Dutchman mine, supposedly quite a bit. - Why couldn't some large corporate organization just go in there and mine it? - I don't know. I suppose they could, if they weren't too greedy. - Let's not fly over them. - Oh mom. - Let's. I'm curious. But let's not waste a lot of time. I wanna be in San Diego no later than six. - Why do you have to be there by six, Howard? The reunion isn't until tomorrow. - Wouldn't you kids like to swim and relax tonight? - It'd be nice, but we don't have to be there by six. - I wanna be there by six. (despairing music) What do you think, Mike? - I think this is really great. - See, if you'd gone to survival camp, you wouldn't have had this opportunity. - I guess the Lord had a better idea, huh, Mike? - What's all this talk about the Lord all of a sudden? What'd you do, join one of those Jesus groups at school? - Don't knock it, Howard. It's changed her whole attitude. - Oh really, how? - That's what I've been trying to tell you, daddy. I've accepted Jesus Christ as my personal savior. Doesn't anybody have anything to say? - What's there to say? - I'd say it's exciting. - It's exciting that she goes away to college for two years and comes home a fanatic? - If when you say fanatic you mean enthusiastic, you're right. She has a lot to be enthusiastic about. - I think it's really a shame that so many people wait until they're in serious trouble before going to God. (hopeless music) - The Superstition Mountains are just beyond those red rocks. I'll go a little lower so you can get a better look, Mike. - [Narrator] And Solomon said as he came forth from his mother's womb, naked shall he return as he came, and taking nothing of his labor, which he may carry it away in his hand. (unpleasant music) - There they are, Mike, about 20 miles straight ahead. (eagle screeches) (thudding) - [Howard] What's the matter? - We hit something. (dramatic music) We're losing altitude. I think we can make it if we land on that mesa up ahead. I'll try to land on the wheels instead of a belly landing, so we might be able to fly it off. (dreadful music) Now listen to me. Tighten your seat belts. Once we're down, get out fast, because there could be a fire. (airplane rattling) (doomed music) Just before we hit, I'll say brace. Everybody put your hands and your head in your lap. (airplane rattling) (dramatic music) Okay. Brace! (terror-stricken music) (Carol screams) - Mike. Debbie. Debbie. - Oh, something fell on my foot. - Are you all right, Howard? - [David] Get away from the plane, hurry. (urgent music) - Don't touch my arm. I think it's broken. (troubled music) Oh, my ribs. My back. - Hurry, get away, go on. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] And the Bible says, "He maketh this sun to rise on the evil and the good. "He sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust." (suspenseful music) - [Billy] Say, Hank, why the trade? - What trade? - I'm a little surprised an old saddle bum like you would trade a Mustang for a Jeep. - Well you been harping at me about all this modern technology. I figured it wouldn't be wise not to try at least one. - Maybe you'll change your mind about the spider plane. - Nope. It's unnecessary, cost too much. Besides, if I give in to you on that, next thing you'll be needing one of them computers. - Why not? It'll do half your work. - Well that sounds good to me. Maybe we oughta get two of them. - This is bonanza six-niner whiskey. Does anyone read? (static crackles) This is Bonanza six-niner whiskey. Does anyone read? (static crackles) This is Bonanza six-niner whiskey. Does anyone read? (static crackles) It's no use. We'll just run down what's left of the battery. - Have you any idea where we are? - Yeah, we're right here on this mesa. The closest airport is over here. And in between, a lot of nothing. - How long will that battery last? - There's no way to tell. You see we can't run the engine to charge the battery. - So now what? - We just try to conserve our strength until they find us. - [Howard] How will anybody know we're down? - Well when we left Santa Fe, we had enough fuel to last for six hours. If we don't arrive in San Diego by six tonight, they'll start checking back over our flight plan and find out that we refueled in Santa Fe, and they'll know we're somewhere between Santa Fe and San Diego. - Oh that's just great. That means they'll know we're somewhere in the Western half of the United States. - No, not quite. As soon as we are confirmed down, civil air patrol squadrons in each of the states along our route will start flying a grid pattern til they locate us. - How long you think it'll take? - Figured it could be as long as two weeks. Could be four or five days, but that's not likely. - How hot is it here? - It looks like a little over 100. - Three days is the limit with no water. - Billy, up to now, your contribution to law enforcement in this county will amount to about as much as an extra quart of water going over Niagara Falls. - Hank, you're so doggone stubborn. An airplane would cost about 35 bucks an hour. If we found the cat in half the time, it would save a bundle. - Now you listen, an airplane will only scare it. I've been one of the best lawmen in this state for over 40 years, and I'm telling you, we'll find that animal without all your modern methods. - Hank, if we had a plane-- - That's the trouble with you kids today. You're lazy. In two days we'll have that animal, and I'm gonna show you how. - [Narrator] Words from a wise man's mouth are gracious, but the lips of a fool will bring him to ruin. His words begin with nonsense and end in sheer madness. The fool talks too much. No man knows what is coming. Without God, who really knows what is going to happen? - And when we catch up, we simply corner it. - It wouldn't be so bad if we had a water source. - Maybe there's water in that valley. - Yeah, and then there might not be too. Wait a minute. - What? - I don't know why I do this. I got so busy trying to solve this problem with my own wisdom I forgot to pray about it. - [Howard] Oh. - Lord, forgive me for getting in your way and trying with my own wisdom to solve this problem. Father, you know our need. You know the end before the beginning. We ask you now for your wisdom and knowledge, to see us through this according to your will, not ours. We commit this fully into your hands as you have told us in your word to cast our burdens onto your shoulders. We ask it in Jesus's name. Amen. Okay, what we have to do now is get a blanket and make a lean-to. - Do you want me to dig a hole for a desert still? - Good idea. - What's a desert still, Mike? - It's a survival technique for getting water from plants and sunshine. (soaring music) - Hey everybody look, an airplane! - Hey, David's prayer worked! - David, get on the radio, quick. (hopeful music) - This is bonanza six-niner whiskey. Does anyone read? (static crackles) This is bonanza six-niner whiskey. Does anyone read? (static crackles) This is bonanza six-niner whiskey. Does anyone read? (static crackles) This is bonanza six-niner whiskey. Does anyone read? (worried music) Well, there goes the radio. Battery's dead now. - That really blows my mind. You pray to God and ask for His help and what happens? Man, either you've got a short circuit or God isn't listening. - Daddy, God doesn't answer prayer always the way we want. He knows our need and we just have to trust Him. - What we need is to find a way out of this mess, and we'd better start trying to find a way to do it. - Where'd you get the plastic, Mike? - [Michael] Well, from the dry cleaning covers on dad's suits. - Is this your desert still? - [Michael] Well, it's not quite finished yet. - Well how does it work? - [Howard] David? - [Michael] Well I'll take this plastic and I'll put it over the hole so it's airtight. Then I'll take a rock and put it right in the middle. Then the moisture from the plants will drip down to this point and go right in the cup. - David. - [David] Yeah? - Is there any chance at all of fixing this and clearing a path to fly out? - I hate to sound negative, Howard, but I'm no mechanic. Even if I were, we don't have the tools. Besides, we don't have the fuel even if we did get it fixed. - [Debbie] David, daddy! Everybody come here quick! - Debbie, what's the matter? - Oh look, there's a town. - Where? - Way over there, see it? It's a long way off, but I think we can make it. - She's right, there is a town. Looks like a good-sized one. Why didn't we see that on our map? - That town's 30 or 40 miles from here. Our chart ends halfway in between. It's not on the map. - Well wouldn't it be possible for one of us to go for help? - That's a good two days walk. I don't think any of us could hack it in our condition. - I could. - No you could not. You get that out of your head right now. We'll stay here for four days. - I think as long as there's a reasonable chance that one of us can make it out of here for help, we oughta try it. - You're suggesting Mike go? - I'm only suggesting that we give some thought to any possibility. - Dad, let me go. I can do it. - Michael, forget it. - How can we in good conscience send a 12-year-old boy down there? - I'm the only one who can go, dad, and besides, what's so dangerous about going from here to that town? - The most dangerous part would be for the one who had to tell your mother. - No. Absolutely not. - Mom, if I don't go, we could all die. Is that what you want? - Michael, if you go down there alone, you could die. Is that what you want? - Carol, we're not saying that Mike should go. We're just trying to think the whole thing through. - I think he could make it. - There's a chance that he might not too. - [Carol] No. - But mom, what could possibly happen between here and that town? (dramatic music) - Base, this is Hank. Can you hear me? - [Man On Radio] Go ahead, Hank. - We're at Red Canyon. Get two men up here as soon as you can. John Rausch is here, dead. Cat got him. Also, call Doug. Tell him I changed my mind about that airplane. (airplane roaring) - David, I know that Christ often teaches us in circumstances like these, but I'm scared. - So am I, a little. This is the time we have to realize that Satan wants to fill our hearts with doubt and fear. - Maybe that's why I'm afraid. I know that God wants to use us here, but I'm afraid I'll goof. - You won't goof. Besides, I'm glad we're here. - Are you serious? - Yep. We had a date tonight in San Diego, and I couldn't think of anything exciting to do. - That'd be the day. Then I guess all we can do is pray about the situation then, huh, David? Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. Anyway, that's not all there is to it. See, God has given us resources, strength, good minds to use. When we're totally committed to Christ, we can use those resources. - Oh yeah. - Let's see what we have in here. - [Debbie] Oh David, no. (sad music) - Looks like he took some purification tablets, maybe some salt tablets. (emotional music) - Are we just going to let him go? David, he's my little brother and he's out there all alone. - No. No, he's not out there alone. (airplane roaring) (commanding music) - Base, this is citizen to seven five layman. Checkpoint alpha zebra. We're starting the search for the cat in Red Canyon. We'll be moving north as instructed. - [Billy] Well Hank, you just can't admit I was right about that plan, now can you? - [Hank] I called it. - [Billy] (laughs) Yeah, you did. You did that. - [Hank] Now don't get cocky, Billy. Just 'cause you nailed up one board don't mean you got a picket fence. - You went and encouraged him. If anything happens to him, Howard Ryan, I'll never forgive you. - Don't blame me, Carol. I didn't tell him to go. I told him no. - You encouraged him. It's your fault we're even here. - What are you saying? - You've got something going, some business deal in San Diego that made you want to go a day early. If it weren't for that we wouldn't even have gotten to go at all. Everything you do you do for Howard Ryan. If we happen to fit in, we're lucky. - Stop it, and both of you. Now let's behave like mature adults. - Mature adults? Now here my family sits, my son is out there alone, talk about immaturity. All you wanna do is pray. Now what kind of an answer is that? - Oh daddy. - Okay, I'll listen to you and I won't argue. I'll give you that much. I wish you did have an answer. - "If you think you are lost, do not panic. "Sit down for a while, survey the area, "and take stock of the situation. "Remember, move with a purpose. "Never start out and wander aimlessly." - It says in Proverbs 3:6, "In all thy ways acknowledge Him, "and He shall direct thy paths." This is the answer, Howard. The Lord has given us His word that he'll show us what to do if we honestly seek to do everything His way. He wants us to recognize Him in everything we do. - You've never been in the construction business. - No, but God has. Who do you think built all this? You don't think I have problems in my business? A few years ago when a normal everyday problem would arise in my life, I never thought about God or prayer. In fact, it even got the point where I was asking myself, "Why am I going to church?" After I accepted Jesus Christ, I realize that He wanted to guide me through every problem, big or small. - How does He guide you? - First of all, He affects the way I look at problems. Okay, here we are in the middle of what could be a disaster for us. As a Christian, if this comes to facing death, I know there's nothing to fear, I have nothing to lose. If the Lord decides that my life here is finished, I have eternity with Christ. Without Him, I have everything to fear, especially death. - Do you mean to tell us God put us in this situation to scare us? - Maybe we're all here because God wants our attention. He has mine, I'll tell you. (suspicious music) - In this situation I simply want to claim God's promise that if I acknowledge Him, I know without a doubt that He'll direct my path, just as He's been doing for the past five years. And since He's never let me down, it's not difficult for me to believe that He'll help us now. - It's all a little hard for me to digest. No matter what happens, it's an easy out for you, and you have all the answers. - I'm not saying that being a Christian is easy or that Christians don't have problems. Listen, Howard, here's the answer, plain and simple, if we believe it. Take Mike for example. Now he's out there somewhere with his survival manual. Now if he believes it and does what it says, difficult as it may be, his chances are pretty good. Now that survival manual won't take away Mike's problems, but it will show him how to get through situations. If Mike refuses to believe that little book of his or just decides to ignore it and then goes on relying on his own wisdom, then he may be overcome by the circumstances. The Bible is the same for us, and the word of God is powerful, but we must trust what it says. God speaks to His people through His holy word if we listen. He's given us a complete guide with directions for life and eternity. Now wouldn't we be foolish not to follow it? (calm music) (snake rattles) (disastrous music) (hawk screeches) - [Narrator] Everything is appropriate in its own time, but though God has planted eternity in the hearts of men, even so, men cannot see the whole scope of God's work from beginning to end. (wondrous music) (cougar yowls) (scary music) (machinery rumbling) - It's been confirmed, we have an airplane down. Five people are involved. The communication search reveals that the aircraft went down west of Santa Fe. The fuel exhaustion time was 14:00. That has terminated. (shadowy music) (beautiful music) - Are you all right, Debbie? - David, I can't help thinking about Michael being down there somewhere all by himself. Somehow it didn't seem so bad during the daytime. Now that it's dark, it seems like he's so vulnerable. - God is just as capable of taking care of Mike at night as He is in the daytime. - Yeah, I know, but I can't help but be concerned though. - It's okay to be concerned. - You know what, David? I wouldn't be at all surprised if this whole thing wasn't another one of your spectacular dates. - (laughs) You think this is good, wait til you see the next one. - Remember our first date when you got your friend, what's his name, Jared, and he was on the police force to arrest us on the way to the football game because you hadn't gotten the tickets and were too embarrassed to tell me, so we sat in the police station and listened to the whole game on the radio. - Yeah, it was a good game too. - David, I think I ought to marry you. Too many more dates like this and I might not be able to. - Listen, I still think we should get married and have you finish school. Ray and Jan are doing it and it's working fine. - I seem to see things so differently out here. All the reasons why I wanted to do certain things or not do them seems so unimportant, almost foolish. (tender music) Everything seems so uncomplicated out here. - Yeah. - We'll go with Plan A, CAP search for light aircraft. Get them out as soon as possible. (pleasant music) - [Man On Loudspeaker] In regard to the light plane advisory from last night, here's an update. Civil air patrol has initiated an air-to-ground search between Santa Fe and San Diego. (airplane roaring) (confident music) - [Man On Radio] The aircraft you've been using will be used in the search. The downed aircraft has five persons. You get all that, Henry? - Yeah, I got that. (thoughtful music) (foreboding music) - It's ironic. I've probably built about 7,000 homes, and all we had to do to get water is pick up the telephone. You said a while ago that God affects the way you look at problems. Well, how do you see me in all this? I mean, how can you-- - Well Howard, you have a lot of money. A lot of money. You have power and influence. You can pick up the phone and call anyone in the country to get something you need or want done. Out here it doesn't get you a drink of water. Your daughter has something that you haven't got and money can't buy, and you didn't give it to her. She has everything in Jesus Christ. Where does that leave you? If we were to die out here, what good is all your money, all those houses you've built, all those important connections you have. The one connection you need out here you don't have. It's not wrong to have a lot of money, Howard, not at all, but it isn't all there is either. (inspired music) (playful music) (confident music) - Well Billy, what'd they teach you in the academy to do in situations like this? - Well Hank, they taught us in situations like this to get out and check this situation. Let's find a place to cross. (sad music) - [Hank] Hey Billy, come here. (weighty music) (puzzled music) - [Billy] I'd say these tracks are about a day old. What do you think? - You stay put. I don't want anything creeping up on me from behind. (worried music) (ominous music) (gunshot fires) - Hello! Can anybody hear me? (troubled music) - My pills, in my pocket. Hurry. - What's the matter? - My heart, it's okay, just need my pills. - I wish you'd told me about this before. You have no business coming out here in your condition. - Hello? I need help! Can anybody hear me? (defeated music) - We've got a very unusual situation. That cat's walking around within 500 yards of here and leaving day-old tracks. Give me that radio. Base, this is Hank, can you hear me? - [Man On Radio] Go ahead. - Billy and I are at Copper Creek. We've spotted the cat. We've also found evidence that leads us to believe that airplane's in this area. That's just a hunch, but send an aircraft to Copper Creek. Have him fly northwest along a corridor 20 miles from this location to Copper City. I'm heading there now. I should be there before sundown. Have all units converge on Copper City. Tell them to watch for trail markers and a kid. You got that? - [Man On Radio] You better stay on the trail then, Hank. It'll take the other units til tomorrow noon at least to reach your position. - Yeah, I know, but tell them to move out now. - [Man On Radio] You said you located the cat. Where is it? - It's following that kid. - Hank, you've gotta get back to town. This is no place for you in your condition. - Look, I've been taking nitroglycerin for the past five years. Now let's stop jawing and move. - Why don't you take the Jeep and go back? I can go on to Copper City if it's the kid you're worried about. - Hey, I don't even wanna go down there, and I'm not about to send a rookie. Copper City's the last place on this earth you wanna be, especially alone. (soaring music) - But David, so many things don't back up what you say. Nothing that's happened out here makes any sense to me at all. You say it's God's plan. The power of the world-- - I don't know what God has planned for us here, but I do know that for his children he has a good plan, a plan so good that the Apostle Paul says in First Corinthians 2:9, "No mere man has ever seen or imagined "what wonderful things God has ready "for those who love the Lord." Hey! (glorious music) - Hey, this is seven five layman. Looks like your man's hunch paid off. The airplane's sitting up on top the flattop mesa in plain sight. I can see four people who look like they're in pretty good shape. Can you send a helicopter up here right away? (elated music) (troubled music) (rejoicing music) - How about that? I knew he could do it. Huh, Carol? Our boy did it. (exhausted music) - I don't know anything about your son. Is he supposed to be with me? - He's the one who got the word back that we were here. - Nobody told me anything about that. - Look, he's only 12 years old. He left here yesterday afternoon to go down to that town in the valley to get help. - There isn't a town within 50 miles of here, sir. - Well there's a town down in the valley. Come here, I'll show you. See, it's right down-- - Copper City? He went down there? That's a ghost town. (miserable music) (exhausted music) - [Billy] Hello! Maybe the kid just kept going. - I hope so, for his sake, maybe ours. (troubled music) - I think you feel about Michael now the way that God feels about you, daddy. - How? - Well God's heart aches for both of you, just like yours aches for Mike. According to God's word, those without Christ, well, they're lost. God would do anything to get you back. In fact, He did. He sacrificed His son, Jesus Christ, on the cross to get you back. How would you have felt, daddy, if you had had to make the deliberate decision to send Michael out into the desert, knowing he would die, to save us? You wouldn't do it. Now we can all realize how grieved God must've been and is now for you and Mike. The Sheriff and many others are out looking for Michael. Their work isn't finished. The work of Jesus is. When he went to the cross, it's all He could do to save us from our lost condition. - Honey, we believe in God, you know that. - You believe God is, but the word believe means to trust. Do you want to trust? Do you want to believe what Christ is, what he said, what he does, what he's done? I know God will do what's best for Mike. - Honey, I want to believe and trust, but you say you know. How can you know? - The Holy Spirit speaks to us deep down in our hearts and tell us when we really are God's children. You can't reason it. You have to believe. I trusted Him and He's never failed. He always keeps His word. - How? - Well first of all, daddy, He said He would change our lost condition. He saved me. He promised to give us purpose and direction in life and help to accomplish that purpose. I've been given that direction in peace, and all I had to do was ask forgiveness and ask Jesus into my heart. - How do you expect me to believe that God is still loving after what we've just been through, and with my son, your brother, lost out there? (frenzied music) - Hank, why don't I go over there and cover the hotel and the mining camp? - That area's too dangerous for anybody not familiar with it. There's loose shale, old mine shafts rotted out. Rattlesnakes hibernate in those buildings down there. You check this area here. I'll check over there. If either of us spot anything, fire three shots. - Hank, you're being just plain foolish and stubborn. - Don't give me anymore argument. Just do as I say. - You always think you're right, Hank, don't you? - I don't think I'm right. I know I'm right. - Well don't you see it, daddy? This whole thing has given us an opportunity to share. It brought you and mom to a point where you can accept Jesus Christ. This whole situation could save your souls for eternity. You and mom would never have listened before. It took this to get your attention. - Only God knew what it would take, and it taught us a lot about faith and trusting too. Besides, Debbie's changed her mind about waiting another two years to get married. - Is this a proposal, David? - You betcha. I'm afraid this will have to do, for now. - I would like to have what you kids have got. - I need to think about it. - Jesus said in Revelation 3:20, "Behold I stand at the door and knock. "If any man hear my voice and open the door, "I will come into Him." First you must believe that Jesus Christ is the son of the living God, and believe that Christ died on the cross for your sins and was resurrected. You need to open the door to your heart. Admit you're a sinner. Ask forgiveness. And recognize Him as your Savior. (majestic music) - Dear God, I can see now that you love us and long for us even more than I long for Michael. Forgive me, dear God. I want to surrender all my fears and my selfishness. I do trust Him to save me and live in my heart forever. Please bring Michael back so we can tell him also that Jesus died for him. Amen. (emotional music) (foreboding music) - Hello? Anybody here? (snake rattling) (scary music) Hello? (suspenseful music) (snake rattling) Hello? Anybody in here? (troubled music) (cougar growls) (snake rattling) (gunshot fires) (snake rattling) (cougar yowls) (snake rattling) (cougar yowls) (snake rattles) - Hello? - Get help. - [Michael] Is anybody here? - Help me! - Hello? (catastrophic music) (snake rattles) (cougar growls) (cougar yowls) (gunshot fires) - Hank, where are you? (dramatic music) Hank? - Over here. - What happened? - There's a man down there. (sad music) (snake rattles) (gunshots firing) - Were you in that plane that went down? - Did you find my family? - They're fine. How long have you been here? - Since last night. - Someone's been watching over you, kid. Poor old guy. Henry, you thought you had all the answers. Hank here thought he sometimes knew more than God Himself. (weighty music) - [Narrator] For there is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. - Hi. - Michael! - Mike! - Michael! - I told you I could do it, mom. I told you I could do it. - Mike! - But it wasn't as easy as I thought. - We're proud of you, Michael, we really are. - I lost my survival guide. I wish I had it so I could show you what I did. - I have a new one for you, Mike. - What's this for? - I think that's for people like me. - [Narrator] And after all his searching, Solomon said, "Here is my final conclusion. "Fear God and keep His commandments, "for this is the whole duty of man." Jesus himself said, "A man's salvation, his greatest work, "it is finished." (majestic music)
