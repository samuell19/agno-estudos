(soft music) (sheep bleating) (children laughing) (panting) - What is it? - Fear not, I am the angel of peace. Pray with me. - [All] My God, I believe, I adore, I trust and I love you. I beg pardon of you to those who do not believe, do not adore, do not trust, and do not love you. - Pray like that. The hearts of Jesus and Mary are listening to your prayers. - [Kids] Almost all eternity, I adore you. My God, my God, I love you in the most blessed sacrament. - Pray a great deal. The hearts of Jesus and Mary want to use you to show their mercy to the world. Offer up prayers and sacrifices to the most high. Make everything you do a sacrifice and offer it as an act of reparation for the sins by which God is offended. Offer up acts of sacrifice to bring sinners back to God. - [Narrator] Angel appeared to three Shepherd children in Portugal in 1916. This was to prepare them for an extraordinary event that would happen soon in Fatima. It would change their lives and yours forever. (cock crowing) (sheep bleating) - Lucia! Lucia, hurry up. - Coming, mama. Come on, Fluffy, let's get you some breakfast. (bell dings) (sheep bleating) - Now, don't forget to say the rosary after you eat lunch. - I won't mama. - It's about time. - Sorry. I'm late. I had to make the bed. - Hi, Fluffy - I learned how to dance sandiego last night. - Really? Teach it to me. - Come on, the sheep are hungry. - I'm going to ask my mother to let me go to communion. - But the priest won't let you till your 10, - You aren't 10 and you go to communion? - It's because I know all my catechism and you don't. - It isn't fair. - Lucia, will you teach me catechism? (bright music) (kids laughing) (bird squealing) - Let's yank out all its feathers. - Let it go! - We caught it, get lost. - Big bullies. - Please! I'll give you some money if you let it go. - Let's see it - Here! - It's a deal, take it. What a fool. - You're fool. - You shouldn't have given those bullies all your money. - There. Feel better? (bird chirping) Fly little bird. Don't get caught again. (upbeat music) - Francisco! Play your flute and I'll teach Lucia the sandiego. - Okay. (upbeat flute music) - No dancing until we say the rosary. - But it takes forever. - I know how we can say the rosary faster. - You do? - How? - Easy. Instead of saying the whole thing, we just say the name of each prayer. - But that's cheating. - Not really. We're saying the whole rosary, aren't we? - What if my mother found out? - I'm not gonna tell her. - Promise not to tell? All right, we'll say the shortcut rosary, justice this once. - [All] Our father, hail Mary, hail Mary, hail Mary. Our father, hail Mary, hail Mary, hail Mary, hail Mary, hail Mary, hail Mary. (rock thumps) - This one is so heavy. - Listen, an echo. - Mary! - What was that? We'd better head home, there's a storm coming. - But there aren't any clouds. - What's happening? - Look! - What is it? - Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you. - Where are you from? - I am from heaven. - Lucia, who are you talking to? - A beautiful lady from heaven. - Tell her I want to see her too. - Tell Francisco to pray the rosary and he will see me. - Pray the rosary and you will see the lady. - Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is... - What do you want of me? - I want you to come here for six months in succession on the 13th day at this same hour. Then I will tell you who I am and what I want. - Am I going to heaven too? - Yes, you are. - And Jacinta? - She will too. - And Francisco? - Also, but he will have to say many rosaries. - I see her. - Do you wish to offer to God all the sufferings he desires to send you in reparation for the sins for which he is offended and to pray for the conversion of sinners? - Yes, we do. - You will have much to suffer, but the grace of God will comfort you. - [All] Almost all eternity, I will adore you. My God, my God, I love you in the most blessed sacrament. - Say the rosary every day to obtain peace with the world. (sheep bleating) - Wow, what a beautiful lady. - She was the most beautiful lady I've ever seen. I'm so excited. - What did the lady say? I couldn't hear her. (upbeat music) (sheep bleating) (laughs) - I am ready to talk to Risa about the lady. - No, you can't do that. We can't tell anyone. - But Lucia. - It should be our secret. - We're home! - Mama! I'm so happy. (pig squeals) - You silly pig. - We saw the most beautiful lady from heaven at the Cova today. - Jacinta, what lady? What are you talking about? - Oh, oh! Mama, I promised not to say. - Did Francisco see this lady too? Francisco, come here. - Look, Olimpia's children, everyone saying they saw a lady from heaven. - I don't believe it, telling lies like that. - But some say it's the truth. - They're lying. (upbeat music) - Lucia, ain't you hungry? - I was thinking, the lady told us to say the rosary and to make sacrifices. - That's right. Let's give our lunch to the poor. - That's a good sacrifice. - Are you trying to make our family the laughing stock of the entire district? - But Mommy! I have never tolerated a single lie from any of my children, much less applied like this. (cries) - I am not lying. - And what did the lady say to you the second time? - The lady wants her to be sent to school to learn how to read. - Is this true, Lucia? - Yes, father. As if it matters to the Blessed Virgin, whether you can read and write. - I never said it was the Blessed Virgin. The lady hasn't told us who she is. - Doesn't seem like a revelation from heaven to me, but it maybe a deception of the devil. - The devil! - We shall see. We shall see. We shall give our opinion later on. (cricket creaking) - I'm not going to the Cova to see the lady anymore. - We can't go without you. You're the one who has to talk. - I don't care, I'm not going. - I'm going, because the lady told us to. - God is already sad over so many sins. If you don't go, he will be sadder. - I'm not going. Dear Lord, I don't know what to do. (crowd chattering) - Those fools going to the Cova, Father. This is the devil's work. - Make way for the children to see our lady. (crowd chattering) - [Kids] Hail Mary, Lord grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou... (indistinct) - Take off hats! I see the lady coming! - [Kids] Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, (indistinct) - What do you want of me? - I want you to come here the 13th of next month. Continue to say the rosary every day in honor of our lady in order to obtain peace for the world and the end of the war. Because only she can obtain it. - I want you to tell us who you are and you perform a miracle so that everyone will believe that you have appeared to us. - Continue to come here every month. In October, I will tell you who I am and what I want. And I will perform a miracle so that all may believe. - I have some things to ask you. People want me to ask you for these things. - They must say the rosary in order to obtain the graces during the year. Sacrifice yourselves for sinners and say many times, especially when you make some sacrifice, "Oh Jesus, it is for your love "for the conversion of sinners "and in reparation for the sins "committed against the immaculate heart of Mary." (people screaming) You see hell, where the souls of poor sinners go. In order to save sinners from falling into hell, God wants to establish in the world, the devotion to my immaculate heart. If you do what I tell you, many souls will be saved. There will be peace, but if men do not cease offending God, their sins will bring war hunger and persecution of the church and the Holy father, the Pope. To prevent this, I shall come to ask for the consecration of Russia, to my immaculate heart and the communion of reparation on the first Saturdays. If my wishes are fulfilled, Russia will be converted and there will be peace. If not, Russia will spread her errors throughout the world, promoting wars and persecution of the church. The good will be martyred, the Pope will have much to suffer and various nations will be destroyed. But in the end, my immaculate heart will be victorious. The Pope will consecrate Russia to me and it will be converted. And a time of peace will be given to the world. In Portugal, the faith will always be, do not tell this to anybody. You may tell it to Francisco. When you say the rosary, say after each mystery, "Oh my Jesus, forgive us our sins. "Save us from the fires of hell. "Lead all souls to heaven, especially those in most need." - Do you want nothing more of me? - No, today, I want nothing more of you. - What did she look like? - What did she say? - It's a secret. - Good or bad? - Good for some, for others bad. - And you won't tell us? - It's a secret. - [Police] Open up in the name of the law. - What do you want? - You and your child are ordered to appear before the administrator tomorrow for trial at Oram. - Trial! For what? - You'll find out in court. - Oh God, help us. - If they kill you, tell them we wanna die too. - [Man] Lucia! - I have to go. - Francisco and I will pray for you. - Tell me the secret. - No! - Do you believe this nonsense? - Oh, no, sir. All of this is just women's tales. - And you! What do you say? - The same things my children do. - Then you think it is true that this lady will come tomorrow? - Yes, sir. I believe she will. - Get out of here. If you don't tell that secret, it will cost you your life. (crowd chattering) - Oh, no, more trouble. - Mr. Santos, I have come to take the children to the miracle. - Oh. No, thank you, Excellency. They can walk. - (chuckles) Yes. But first, they must visit the priest at Fatima. He wants to ask them some questions, you know. - He, he does? - Who told you these things you're saying? - The lady I saw at the Cova. - Is it true that the lady confided a secret to you? - Yes. - Tell it then? - I can't. But if you like, I'll ask the lady and if she gives me permission, I'll tell you. - Enough of this nonsense, let's get going. In you go! (horse snorts) - You're going the wrong way! - We're going to see the priest first in Oram first. Then I'll take you to Fatima. Don't worry, you get there in time. - Where is he really taking us. - Our lady must be sad because we didn't go to the Cova. I bet she won't to appear to us anymore. (Jacinta cries) - I don't know, I think she will. - I wanted to see her so much. (Jacinta continues crying) - We'll never see our parents again. - Don't cry, Jacinta. Let's offer, this is a sacrifice to Jesus. Like the lady told us to do. - Let's say the rosary. - Hey, this isn't a chapel. - [Kids] Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. - Get up your knees and come with me. - I have tried to save you, but since you will not obey the government, you shall be boiled alive in a cauldron of hot oil. (giggles) - Executioner!. - Yes, Excellency. - Is the oil good and hot. - Yes, Excellent. - Boiling? - Boiling, hot. - Good. - Take this one and throw her in. - No! No! - What do we care if they kill us? We'll go right to heaven. - She's frying. Now for the next one. - Let me go! - You better tell me the secret Lucia. - I would rather die. - Very well. You shall. (groans) - Jacinta! Francisco! You're alive. I'm so happy to see you. - I'm sad, 'cause we didn't see the lady. - We will, we will. - It's bad enough you lie to me, to the Holy Priests for all these months. But, Lucia you promised the whole world a miracle at noon tomorrow, no less. - If the lady does not make the miracle, the crowd will kill you. - I'm not scared. I know the lady will do everything she has promised. (crowd chattering) - Better get going. - Mama! - If you must go, I will go and die with you. - What time is this lady going to arrive? - At midday. - Oh, midday is past. It's all a fake, it's a hoax. - Our lady told us to come, we saw her other time and we're going to see her now. - Jacinta, the flash. - Watch out, Lucia! Don't be deceived by the devil! - [Man] Look! Her light. (bright uplifting music) - What do you want of me? - I want to tell you that I wish a chapel to be built here in my honor. For I am the lady of the rosary. Continue to say the rosary every day. Do not offend our Lord and God anymore because he is already so much offended. - They have many things to ask of you, if you'll heal some sick persons, the conversion of sinners and other things. - For some yes, not others. It is necessary for them to amend their lives, to ask forgiveness of their sins. Do not offend God our Lord anymore for he is already deeply offended. - Look at the sun! - [Woman] Look, the sun is dancing. - [Woman 2] The sun it's a miracle. The children were right. - Blessed be our lady. - It's true a real miracle. - The children were right. Jesus, I have sinned. Save me. - [Man] The sun is falling. - Everything is dry it's a miracle. - You did appear. - There is the Holy Family. - [Lucia] Jesus is blessing the world. - It's a miracle. - [Narrator] Francisco and Jacinta were soon to be taken to heaven. Lucia was to remain upon earth. For more than 70 years, she spread devotion to the immaculate heart of Mary. Lucia became a Carmelite nun, more than once the book came to Fatima. Each time Lucia was at his side. Our Lady wants you to pray the rosary each day, go to confession often, receive Jesus in Holy communion and make the first Saturdays. (uplifting music)
