Follow me, come on. ( chuckles ) We've gotten really good at not hitting our heads finally. Cameraman: Ah, some of us have. ( laughs ) Hi, everyone, and welcome to Luke's kitchen. ( laughs ) Look at this. Oh, yeah. Chocolate is like gold. No, no. It's better than gold. Man: All right. Hey, Julia. Hi. Welcome to my home away from home. This is the green house. This is our gym facility. Perfect timing. Commander Will Sack's in the middle of a workout. Will, what happens in here? You know. I'm just lifting some weights. Benching about 250. ( Cameraman laughing ) Yeah, right. Step in here and this is the living room. And this is where we spend the majority of our leisure time. Cameraman: Yeah, this is where I kick everyone's butt in "Dance Central." ( both laughing ) Haha, yeah. That's my move. Don't steal my move. ( knocking ) Knock, knock. We're allowed to send one message a week to our families. But there is a 45-minute delay on it. Just like an actual trip to Mars. Let's see, Luke's room-- - Hey! Hey! Whoa! - We're doing the video for the science committees. Did you want us to come back another time? Do you mind? Oops. Nelly's working on something today. What are you doing? I'm currently testing some of our digestive enzymes. Cameraman: Ooh, fun stuff. Before things get too messy, thank you, Nelly for the tour. And we'll check back in a little bit. - Thanks, bye, guys. - Bye. All right, let's get these chips out. There we go. So, Julia's down there? Yes, she is. That's right. Man: Mr. Baker, Are you aware that in the entire history of national and international space exploration, there has never been a disaster of this category? Yes, sir. I am aware of that. Do you think in retrospect, had you made different decisions, this might have been prevented? What might have been prevented? The deaths of nearly your entire crew. On April 26, 2012, six qualified candidates landed in Antarctica. Entered ICE-SAT 5. The doors were closed, locked, and sealed. The mission was classified a failure. Man: I just wanna state for the record, this is the worst idea you've ever had. And you've had some pretty bad ideas. What are you talking about? If it works, we're heroes. - And if it doesn't? - Kerns, this division has been risk adverse for far too long. Time for a little change up, don't you think? Besides, you asked for a new program before my review. Here it is. You do know, that we're never going to Mars, right? Of course we're not. ( photographers shouting ) Man: Beginning a mark not only sentimental moment in the history of the United States, but in the history of mankind. Please welcome, our program manager and creative director, Reed Baker. I have the distinct pleasure of introducing you to our six brave volunteers. Geologist, Julia Meyers. Sociologist and anthropologist, Thom Jason. Former US Air Force pilot, Will Sacks. Biomedical engineer, Luke Millens. Medical scientist, Dr. Nelly Rugin. Former US Marine, Dane Hankeard. The six individuals you see before you will spend the next 471 days without sunlight or fresh air, or direct contact with the outside world. They will be locked inside the isolated, confined environment, the ICE-SAT 5. Simulating an actual trip to the red planet. - Man: Mr. Kerns. - Yes. Our records indicate that you had a surplus of monies at the end of fiscal year, 2011. Is that correct? Yes, that's correct. How much money was left over in the fourth quarter budget of that year? Um... I believe it was $94 million. Give or take. And if you didn't spend that money on a new program by September 30, 2011, what would happen to that money? We would lose it. Doesn't that strike you as odd, Mr. Kerns? Not particularly, no. Because it's obvious to me that there was clear incentive to initiate this program before it was properly vetted. We performed all the necessary evaluations to ensure the most successful mission possible. You did not, Mr. Baker. Our review indicates egregious violations in processes that you were responsible for. You put human lives at risk. Will: Okay, guys. Your suit pressure looks good. - ( alarm blares ) - Vacuum in the chamber is stabilized. Start your walk. Dane: Here we go. Julia: Today we are going to explore the local terrain. Up to about 10 meters. And we're going to collect a variety of samples and then analyze them in the lab. Dane: Oh, my God. Possible extraterrestrial sighting. Never mind. That's just Julia. ( laughs ) All right, guys. Let's stay focused. Thank you. Did you set it? ( Dane giggles ) Yeah. You see it? Where is it? - You don't see it? - No. It's right there on top of that rock. - Oh, my God. - ( both giggling ) - Okay, are you ready? - Yeah, do it. Three, two, one. Dane: Boom! Yes! ( both laughing ) - I love this job. - ( laughs ) Julia: Okay, Luke. We're rolling. Oh. Okay, everyone. Tonight is pizza party night. - Dane: Yeah! - Will: Yeah! But let me be clear. This is not a real pizza. It's a-- it's a simulation of a pizza. Because it's a simulation of a trip to Mars. ( all laughing, cheering ) Nelly: Gotcha. Since we don't have the right ingredients, we have to use what we have here in the module. Right? We've got some freeze dried vegetables. and some... - Oh, yeah. - Ah. Dry... toast-like thing. - Julia: God, I hate that stuff. - Will: Delicious. We'll make it work. So, pizza time. See you guys, later. - Looks amazing. - Thank you. - Dane: Yeah! - Will: That looks unbelievable. When I say, "Unbelievable..." - Nelly: It smells. - It does. This is actually one of our better experiments. Of course it is, we got the recipe on Mars. - ( laughs ) - That's really good. Dear Lord, our God. We thank you for this great food and for this unique experience and opportunity. May we all continue this journey with humility and gratitude. We are so grateful to be in such great company. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. So, here's to the celebration of the first quarter of our mission. Only 328 days left to go. ( all laughing ) - Cheers. - Nelly: Cheers. - Will: Nice. - Cheers. Thank you. You look great in an apron. Damn right I do, little lady. Well, get used to it. Only men are allowed to cook and clean on Mars. - Say what? - Oh, you didn't hear? Sexism is reversed in space. I didn't know there was sexism on Earth. We did not get that memo. Oh, don't worry, you will. Will: What is that? - Uh. - What is that? Zero gravity hand slap. - ( laughing ) - That's pretty good. - That was lame. - Working on it. - It was pretty lame. - Nelly: It was good. Hi, guys. Just checking in. Everything's great here, we're all happy. Everybody's healthy. And we're all getting along, for the most part, anyway. It's actually been getting quite boring here lately. That's for sure. There's only so many games of solitaire one can play and urine samples you can give before it gets pretty old. Oh, well. No one ever died from boredom, I guess, right? Okay. So, I'll let you go for now. Oh, and Sarah and Michael, if you're watching this, keep an eye on your father. He has high cholesterol. And cereal is not an acceptable meal for dinner. Cook in some vegetables. Okay. I love you guys. Take care of each other. Bye. ( knocking on door ) Could you join us in the living room please, - we've got a big problem. - Sure. So, Thom has discovered that some of his allocated chocolate has disappeared. Your more than welcome to check the scan logs. So, I'd like to know which one of you took it. Uh... I hope you guys don't think I did. I'm watching my figure. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Thom. It wasn't me, Will. Thom and I both keep excellent scanning logs of all the food. I would never do anything like that. Okay, so not one of you is going to admit to taking the chocolate? With all due respect, Will, how do we know it wasn't you? You don't, Luke. But I didn't take it. You have my word. Okay? Last chance. All right. So I'm revoking one bar per person and giving it to Thom. - Thanks, everybody. - Dane: A full bar? - Luke: No. Wait. - Nelly: What? - Thanks, Will. I appreciate that. - No problem. Luke: Will! Will. Will. That's unfortunate. ( gasps ) Mr. Baker, were you aware that Commander Will Sacks had recently lost his daughter? I was aware. Were you aware that Mrs. Sacks subsequently took her own life? Yes, ma'am, I was aware. Do you feel that this unfortunate event might have influenced his judgment in commanding his crew? ( poker chips clinking ) Game night here. Just so you can get a better idea of how competitive and how vicious we can actually be. Oh, yeah. We are so vicious. - Wha-- - Will: Oh, my God. So, tonight we're playing poker. No, we're not just playing poker, we're playing brother from another mother. Now you're talkin' my language. What the hell is that? Okay. Jacks are wild. But only when played with a single queen. - Will: Nice. - Ooh. Well, things are getting a little racy. We'll come back later. For now, bye. Who wants popcorn? - I'll take popcorn. - Do it. Yeah, I'll have some popcorn. You sitting here, J? No. I was at the end. Move over, big bear. - Excuse you, girl. - I'll show you how we are - in my neck of the woods. - Yeah, let's see what you got. All right, ante up, people. ( imitates Nelly ) "My neck of the woods." ( men laughing ) Dane: It's an inside joke. It's an inside joke. Okay, guys. The game is still going on and it's pretty intense. Will is out. Dane: Ruh-oh. Julia: Luke, Dane, and Nelly are still in. And let me tell you the stakes are high. Thom, why don't you tell them what they're playing for. Thom: Uh... right now they are up to six weeks hygiene facility cleaning duty. And whoever loses, it ain't gonna be pretty. I can tell you that much. Can you turn that off, please? Just, can you just turn it off. - Okay. - ( clicks ) All right, here we go. The river. Nelly? Mm. We only have 270 more days left in the tank. Cards aren't gonna change themselves. Will: The seasons might. ( Thom laughs ) All right. I'm out. - Will: Yeah, baby. - Julia: Oh... What to do, what to do? Thom: Guys, you gotta show. I'll show 'em. Eat that, reverend. Oh! Damn it-- Dang it! ( snickering ) Thank you, God! Thank you, God. - Nelly: Well played. - Yes! You better watch it, my friend. God will strike you down for blasphemy like that. Oh, he just struck me down. Struck me down with "A-whoopin' your ass." ( laughing ) I don't find that very funny. Nelly: Luke. Seriously? Thom: Congratulations. Good hand, man. ( whispers ) Hi. Is everybody out? Yeah, I think so. Are you writing me a love letter? Of course I am. Oh, my God. You taste so good. ( moans ) Hey. Oh, God. Okay. Oh, God. You want it all? Shh. Yeah. ( gasps ) Okay, don't move. Don't move. It's sensitive. Oh, God. I'm sorry. That felt so good. It's okay. We can just go again. ( sighs ) Oh, God. Lay down. I'm kinda tired. - Tired? - Yeah. I had to get up at like, 5:00 am this morning. Nelly: Are you fucking kidding me? Yeah, to check the logs. This is like, third time you've pulled this shit on me, Dane. What? What? Where the hell did you learn that sex was just for pleasing a man, huh? I thought it felt good. It's not all about you, okay? Newsflash, women can orgasm too. I'm not just here to serve you. - I'm not your fucking mother. - ( mutters ) - How did my fucking mother get involved-- - Jesus, my bra's on... ( sighs ) You know... you're not 12 years old, Dane, okay? Learn to fucking control yourself-- What the fuck is that? The power's out? ( both ) Fuck. Get your clothes on. - Get your clothes. - Yeah, I'm trying. Okay, you go notify OP team. ( knocks ) Yeah, we know. The power's out. I'll go notify Mission Control. I know I fucked up, okay? Let's just go. Newsflash, everybody. This is what's going on, we've lost power It went out at 02:26. It's now 04:48. We've contacted the OP team, we're waiting for a response. I'm sure they're working on it. In the meantime, we've decided to go back to bed, and see what's happening in the morning. Which is pretty soon. Nighty-night. Dane: Yeah, sweet dreams. Good night. ( distant clanging ) ( computer beeping ) - Any response yet? - No, nothing. You tried the emergency line? Yeah, we tried everything Hey, guys. I don't want to alarm anyone, but, uh... - What? - The oxygen read says we only have 16 hours and 13 minutes left. They'll get it fixed by then, I'm sure. - What if they don't? - Dane: It's not an option. Don't you think we should consider - all possibilities? - Yes, we should, Thom. Where's Luke? - Where do you think? He's praying. - Great. - All right, Julia? - Julia: Yeah? You go to the green house. Get four beds and the best oxygen generating plants. Bring to the living room. Thom, you set a timer for the oxygen. Nelly, you keep trying to contact the deck. Okay, don't stop. Dane, come with me. Nelly: Copy that. Nothing, man. I don't hear a thing. Well, wouldn't they be out there working on it? Yeah, I should think so. How long would it take them to get here from McMurdo? Six, seven hours maybe. So, what do we do now? We wait. ( beeping ) Will: How's the gang? Dane: They're holding up. Some better than others. - How are you holding up? - I'm good. So, you think this is a test or there's really a problem with the generator? Um... I'm not sure, I keep going back and forth on it. - You? - Yeah, pretty much the same. I don't know, man. How long till we pull the plug on the whole thing? Probably 02:30. That would leave us with just under an hour of oxygen. Yeah, give or take. - That would fucking suck. - I know. To come this far and have it all be a waste. It's not gonna come to that. What a joke. I'd be so fucking pissed. Dude, I am the commander. All right? I'm supposed to be able to figure this out. Well, you're doing all you can do. You've been a fucking rock star directing this whole mission so far. Thanks, man. I appreciate it. No, trust me. If I didn't think you were doing a good job, you'd know about it. - I know. - ( laughs ) You're doing a pretty great job yourself. - It's been quite a ride. - Thank you, buddy. Cheers. Come quick. There's something wrong with Thom. The ride ain't over yet. He's having a seizure, just give him some space. ( groaning ) Dane: Here, have him bite down on this. No, it'll break his teeth. There's nothing we can do. We just need to let him ride it out. It's okay. It's all right. Okay. Okay. - ( groaning continues ) - Okay. - That's it. Deep breaths. - ( panting ) Deep breaths. It's all okay. Julia: Does he normally have seizures? Not that I'm aware of. Will: What do you think caused it? Stress and maybe the lack of oxygen. Mr. Baker, what is Contingency Plan 241? Contingency Plan 241 was a procedure that was implemented to evaluate the physical and emotional effects on the crew of a simulated emergency situation. And did you follow the guidelines of Contingency Plan 241? To my knowledge, yes. Our records indicate that you bypassed critical processes and procedures undermining the mental stability of your crew. Will: What are you doing? - What are you doing? - Will, this is bullshit, okay? - They're jeopardizing our safety now. - We can't just give up. I've worked my whole life for this. I'm not gonna let some stupid little seizure - ruin it for me. - We're running out of oxygen, Luke. What part of that do you not get? It'll be back on soon, Dane. It needs to come back on now. Hello! Help! - Hello? - Hey! Hey! Will: Guys, guys! - On now! - Oxygen, let's take it-- Fucking ignoring us. Man, this is bullshit. - Fuck! - Luke: Oh, yeah, that'll work. Good thinking, man. I don't hear you coming up with any bright ideas. And you're stupid fucking prayers apparently aren't doing shit. Oh, I'm sorry, maybe we should all just act like you when things get tough. Just fuck our way out of the situation. But from what I hear you can't even - do that well, so... - What the fuck did you just say to me? - I will fuck you up! - No! Dane! - Guys! - Dane! ( groans ) - Calm down. - I'm calm, okay? I got it. I got it. Stop it. You-- ( groans ) You pushed it too far, didn't you? Sir, in retrospect, clearly some mistakes were made. You put people's lives on the line. Do you understand that? What you did was immoral and unacceptable. Period. Reed: The team here felt that we needed to test the boundaries of an emergency situation, to gauge your collective response to extreme circumstances, especially being so close to the third quarter effect. We encourage you to use your team building skills to resolve conflict and just focus on the task at hand. Team building skills? Go team. Yeah, well, we probably should have expected something like this. - Nelly: I didn't expect this. - She's right, they did not say there were gonna be any surprises. Yeah, they didn't say there weren't either. Come on, that's bullshit. Look, guys. This happened, okay? That's the bottom line. We have to move past it. Right now. Are we good? Look, we can't come this far and give up now. You wanna throw away everything you've worked for? I don't. I need answers, people. Come on. I wanna finish. Yeah, I'm good. Yes. Luke, Dane... I'm fine. It's all good. All right then. Let's do it. Just stay the fuck away from me. Thanks. Hey, Will. Um... You're not gonna tell the OP team about what happened, are you? I haven't had a seizure since I was 11, and I don't know what happened. Look, don't worry about it. It's all good. - Thanks. - Sure. - Okay. - Thank you. - I'll make dinner. - Great. Thanks, man. Will: I feel like things are falling apart. Like I'm losing control. What once was an exciting adventure has become a series of awkward glances and uncomfortable encounters. The crew is now choosing solitude over social interaction. I had no idea this was gonna be this hard. You can train for months, but nothing can prepare you for the cold, hard reality of the loneliness you can feel. Even with someone sitting right next to you. The tank feels empty now. Only ghosts of people who once felt hope. And inspiration. Thom: Everyone is treating me different now. Like I have a disease they're afraid of catching. I feel awful. The last thing I would want to do is jeopardize this mission that people have sacrificed so much for. If this mission failed because of me, I don't know what I'd do. Man: Do you understand the high psychological risk associated with such prolonged isolation and confinement? - I've read all the studies-- - Social withdrawal. Irritability. Poor impulse control. Unprovoked anger. Paranoia. Psychosis. - Hallucinations. - I think we get the point. No, I don't think you do. These people weren't lab rats. You are playing with their lives. They were fragile and vulnerable and you took advantage of that. Is there anything you want to say? No. Thank you for your time, gentlemen. This concludes our initial hearing. A criminal investigation will be performed in parallel. I found this deleted in the company hard drive. You pushed him through the system knowing full well, he failed his psych evaluation. Do you have any idea what you've done? And do not think you're gonna take me down with you, my friend. The blood of these people is on your hands. Not mine. - Hi, Mom. - Hi, Mommy. - We love you. - We really missed you on Christmas. - I got a bike. - I got a lamb named Fluffy and I made him a collar. And she made up a dance for you. - A song. - Dance. - A song. - Dance. - A song. - Dance. Sarah: A song. Okay. Hush, hush. ♪ I love you, Mommy you're the best ♪ ♪ I wish you'd come home soon ♪ ♪ From the tank. ♪ Michael: I told you she made up a dance. - I wrote a song. - I didn't-- I didn't make up a song. Or a dance. We love you. You're the best. - Bye. - Bye. ( knocks ) Nelly: Hey. Hi, can I come in? Hey. Of course. What's going on? I'm just having a hard day. Or night. Whatever the hell it is. I can never tell. Wanna talk about it? No. I just... I want you to make me laugh. Be funny. I can do that. - ( slaps thigh ) - Come on. We're gonna celebrate New Year's. It's gonna be the greatest New Year's ever. In the tank. - Okay? - Yeah. That sounds great. All right. ( laughs ) Thank you. - What is the round thing in your face? - I don't know. - What is the round thing? - Have a toast. - ( clears throat ) All right. - A little powdered wine. Oh. Non-alcoholic powdered wine. We're such alkies. - To day 250. - ( giggles ) To my most amazing friend. I'll drink to that. Oh, God. That's so disgusting. ( gasps ) Happy New Year's. Happy New Year. ( both giggling ) Come on. Let's get this party started. All right. ♪ I pledge allegiance to the party ♪ ♪ Woo, woo ♪ ♪ C-O-L-A and Bacardi ♪ - ♪ Woo, whoo ♪ - ( giggling ) ♪ I volunteer to get it started ♪ - ♪ Woo ♪ - ♪ Follow my lead ♪ ♪ Be all that you can be... ♪ ( giggling continues ) Dear Lord, please give me the strength that I need to get through these dark and trying times. Lord, there are things happening inside and outside this tank that are blasphemous. And immoral. People are lying. People are sinning. I fear for the salvation of their souls if things do not change. I am seeking counsel in your word, oh, Lord. Please, God, guide my steps. Guide my steps. Please, God, guide my steps. Will: Okay, guys. Your suit pressure looks good. - Thom, what's their oxygen? - ( buzzer sounds ) Oxygen's at 21% nominal. Chamber pressure's holding steady at 10 to the minus six torrs. Okay, guys, go ahead. Start your walk. Julia: Oh, shit. Man down. You okay? All right, let's get them out. Julia: These things are so hard to see in. I almost killed myself on the last walk. I tripped on this rock-- Oh, my God, Dane. That looks awful. You're gonna have Nelly take a look at that, - aren't you? - Uh, no-- Don't worry about it. I'll be fine. Mm, suit yourself. ( power tool whirs ) Luke: And the last time made it on time with every single one of my experiments, every single one of them. Nope, go ahead. I'd like to hear this. No, name one single sample, one single test, one single experiment that I have not completed in under the allotted time. And mind you, that has not been done - without a great degree of-- - Hey, Luke. Oh, hey, Julia. What are you working on? Just fixing one of the UV protector glasses. - That's great. - Yeah. Just doing my job, following the rules. Doing what I do. Well, I want to let you know we're doing dinner in an hour. Perfect. Thanks for letting me know. I am discontent. ( mouthing words ) - ( knocking on door ) - Yeah. Come in. Hey. You got a second? Yeah, of course. Sit down. - What's up? - Well... Have you noticed that Luke's been acting kind of strange lately? What's he doing now? Well, I just walked into the workshop. He's always in that damn workshop. And he was talking to himself. - How exactly? - Not in a normal way. In a creepy, imaginary friend sort of way. Like listening, responding, carrying on an entire conversation. All right, we'll notify Dr. Garrett. We'll get a psych eval on him. I think that's a good idea. Sure. Thanks for telling me. Of course. What are you working on? Oh, it's like a... it's a mock-up of a grain structure that might be sustainable on the Mars soil. Wow, sounds sexy. Oh, yeah. It's very sexy. I like your necklace. - Oh. - I never noticed it before. My daughter made it for me. We went to Cape Cod a couple summers ago. Yeah, I bet you must miss her. You have no idea. I didn't think it was possible to miss someone so much. But you have a daughter, right? - ( sobs ) - Will... What's wrong? What did I... I lost her. I should've been there. I am so sorry. I had no idea. Will. Oh, God. I can't imagine what you've been through. No, no. Sorry. I can't. I'm sorry. No, I shouldn't-- I shouldn't have done that. Oh, God. I feel like an idiot. I'm so sorry. You're not an idiot. We're-- we're just human. Yeah, of course we are. Dear Lord, please give me the strength that I need to make it through these dark and trying times. I am relying on your strength and power, oh, Lord. Know that I am acting as your humble servant. And you, the Almighty Power. I will walk like you. I will talk like you. I will drink from the valley of you, my Lord. Please, Lord. What are my steps? Show me the way. Please forgive me for what I'm about to do. ( computer keys tapping ) ( sighs ) Hey, mama. - Hey. - Need any help in here? Nelly: Are you kidding me? I've been packed for a week. Listen, it's gonna get kind of crazy when we get back, so I just wanted to let you know that I couldn't have made it through this thing without you. I would have gone insane without you. Yeah, me too. You better stay in touch or I'm gonna hunt you down. Mm. Deal. - Come on. Let's get out of here. - Mm. - I'll get this one. - Thank you. - You ready, buddy? - Yeah, you? I'm so fucking ready, bro. You have no idea. Your ankle still bad? It's definitely not good. All right. What time's the release scheduled for again? 12:00 hours. Sounds good. - Fruit salad. - Ah. Pineapple. Mango. Mango. I want a mango pancake. Snicker bar. That you stole. - That was you? - No, it wasn't me. - This is the end. - Oh, yeah. Show me, show me, show me. Will: Just one second. - Guys, just one second. Thank you. - Just one. - Look, I want to be sentimental or anything. - Nelly: Yes, you do. No, I don't. But I just want to say that I'm really very proud to have commanded this crew. You've done an incredible job. Congratulations, guys. We did it. Julia: Yes! Woo! Yeah. Slow clap. You're such a fucking idiot. Excuse me? You still think this is a simulation, don't you? What are you talking about? We're never getting out of this tank. If we do, we're all dead. They lied to us, Will. Don't you get that? They actually sent us to Mars. We're on Mars, right now, guys. Dane: Is this a joke? The fucking joke is us, Dane. We are the fucking joke. You think that tank door is gonna open right now? Your precious little tank door. Let's see if it opens. Count it down, Will. You're the commander. Count it down. Thom, look at your watch. What does it say? - Look at your watch. - Hey, he's going-- - Nelly: Luke! - I'll put your head through the wall. Back off, Dane. I'll blow your fucking brains - all over the wall. - What the hell? Okay, Luke, Luke. Just you wait. Just calm down for a second. Just take a breath, all right? Look, let's just put the gun down and we can talk about this like rational adults. - Shh, shh, shh. Just put the gun down. - No. I'm calling the shots now, Will. I'll say how things are gonna be handled from here on out. Okay? I'll say how things will be handled. I wouldn't do that if I were you. One more step, somebody's gonna get hurt. - Okay, Luke, put the gun down. - ( air shot ) ( loud thud ) Luke: Oh, shit. - Julia! Oh, my God. - Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Back off, Dane! I told you. I told you I'm not fucking around here. This is life and death. They lied to us. We have been deceived. And if you people won't start listening to me, all of you, I will no choice but to kill you. - Pressure. - Got it. Get the bag. Luke. I need to get the emergency kit from the kitchen-- Get back! Luke, you shot her. Okay? If I don't help her, she's gonna die. You said you didn't want to hurt anyone. You made that point, it was very clear. And we're all listening now, I promise you, but I need to get that bag and help her, please. Please. - Fine. Go. - Thank you. See, I told you. I told you that door would not open. They lied to us. Where's your mission control? Where's your project manager now? How come they're not here? How come they're not saving you? Would you stop interrupting me? Shut up, I'm not talking to you, leave me alone. Shh. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Hey, hey. It's me. It's me. - Okay. - Okay, I got it. Luke, why don't you fill us in on what's going on, okay? You were right. They didn't open the hatch. Obviously, you know something that we don't. So, help us out, man. We wanna be on your team. ( scoffs ) I bet you do. Will, over here! Now listen. In order for you to be on my team, people are gonna have to start telling the truth around here. 'Cause there are a lot of lies going on around this tank. Dane, are you a God-fearing man? You don't strike me as a God-fearing man. Pick it up. I said, pick it up! Okay. Ow. Luke: Open to the red bookmark. Read John 8:32. "And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." Yes. Thank you. Thank you. And thank you, God, for showing us all that the truth is the way to our eternal salvation. So, who wants to be saved first? Huh? Thom? Hmm? Let's take a little field trip. Grab your bag. I said grab your bag! Okay. Will, Dane, Thom, let's go. Thom, come on. - Come with me. - We're coming. ( whimpers ) ( gasps ) Luke: In your room, Thom. Dane. All right, all right, all right. You notice anything, Will? Not me, the room. Luke, can we talk about this for a second? The wall, take it down. The other side, show them. Your friend Thom here is a sick, twisted pervert. And he's going to Hell. Were you spying on me the whole time? No. No. I'm so sorry. Why would you do that? I was your friend. I'm sorry. You really are a sick little fuck. Dane. What now, you're just gonna cry like a little fucking-- Hey, hey, hey. That's enough. - Hey! - This is what the truth looks like. Take out your journal. I'm not gonna ask you again. Read it. I'm not gonna read my journal. Read it, Dane. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. "I can't stop thinking about slipping myself inside him." You're going to Hell! - It's the truth! - Thom, wait. Thom. Thom! Thom. Get back. Thom! Thom! Open the door! Open the door. Oh, God. Thom. Thom. Open the door. Okay, stay with me. One more step. ( dull thud ) ( Luke whispering ) What are my steps, Lord? What are my steps, Lord? What are my steps? ( dumbbell banging ) ( groans ) Oh, God. Oh, God. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Be with me, Lord, Stay with me, Lord. Stay with me, Lord. I'm here. A voice. I'm here. I'm devoted. ( panting ) ( whispering continues ) You're my love, you're my savior. Stay with me. Yes, Jesus. Whoa. Yes. He needed to be rescued. Is this what you wanted? ( gasps ) No. Huh? No. You killed him, you psychotic fuck. No. This was your big plan, huh? Was it? I didn't know. I-- I didn't know. You wanna kill me, huh? Come on. Do it. Do it. Do it! I love you. ( air shot ) Holy shit. They're both dead. Oh, my God. How's she doing? She's not doing well, she's lost a lot of blood. What happened? - Where's Nelly? - Um... I don't know, when I got back in here she was gone. I'm so cold. Aren't you? See if you can get her a blanket, come on. Will. Will, make him... in the ground out back. We'll do it. I'm so cold. It's gonna be here soon. Sorry. Could you please turn the-- - Here you go, here you go. - No. I'll quick get you warm. Look. Get you nice and warm. There you go. It's okay, it's okay. All right, Dane. Go find Nelly, all right? We gotta stick together. Dane: Copy that. Nelly! Nelly! Nelly, you can come out, it's safe. ( sniffs ) I got ya, buddy. ( groans ) Mr. Baker: This is not a test. Will? You need to see this. I found it on the hard drive. It came in three days ago. We have just been informed that a condition one blizzard is forming inland over the Polar Plateau. So, it's going to be impossible to make it down there to get you by the original projected date. Now, we all knew that this was a risk, due to Antarctica's mercurial weather as discussed in detail before the mission. So, we're gonna shift to our scheduled plan B and we should be able to get to the ICE-SAT 5 somewhere in the two to four weeks time period. We're fucked. We'd be better off if we were on Mars. I don't believe it. I don't fucking believe this. And where the fuck is Nelly? I don't know. I can't find her. You don't know, we're in a tiny fucking - piece of shit tank. - She's tiny. Maybe she squeezed out the trash shoot. What the fuck are you talking about? - It's 75 below out-- - Will, it's okay! We're going to be okay. Come on. ( alarm blares ) Here. You'll feel better. Hey. I brought you something to eat. Come on. You need it for your strength. When are we getting out of here? What's really going on? The storm's passing. They'll come for us soon. How long? A couple of days. Max. Will, I'm not gonna last a couple of days. Yes, yes, you are. I promised my kids that I would come back. And you will, come on. Look, you're the strongest person here. I don't wanna die like this. I wanna see my family. I miss them so much. Look, you're not going anywhere. Oh, God. I never should have come here. This was stupid. I thought that I could conquer the world and now look at me. We all did this for nothing. Julia, I need you to be strong. Okay? I can't do this without you. Okay. I will. I'm gonna get a new dressing for that, okay? Wait, Will. Could you bring me a paper and pen, please? Hey. Anything? I just sent out the SOS, but they may not be able to get our signal with the weather this extreme. I'll keep trying though. All right, look, you're gooey. Get some rest, okay? - You sure? - Yeah, absolutely. Go on. Thanks. - Ow. - You all right? My God, my fucking ankle is killing me, man. - How does it look like? - Jesus Christ. ( loud rumbling ) ( creaking ) Holy shit. It's a condition one, man. It's not messing around. No shit. All right, look, go get some rest, all right? - That's an order. - Aye aye, captain. And it just keeps getting better. - Did you find anything? - Yeah. You know, the usual space food disaster. Oh, that's my favorite. I would eat anything right now. Well, anything is all you're gonna get. I put online a strongly worded letter-- ( tank rumbling ) Holy shit. This can't be good. ( groans ) - You okay? - Oh, man. I don't know. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna get a light. Aw, fuck, I can't move. Oh, my God. My fucking ankle. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I think I'm fucked. Julia? Julia? Julia? Hey, man. Come on. You gotta eat. Dane? Hey, man. You're burning up. I know. I don't think I'm gonna make it. Yes, you are. The infection's turning septic. It's gonna enter my blood stream and hit my heart. The only way I'm gonna make it, is if you cut it off. - Dane, I think-- - Will, if you don't, I'm gonna die. I know. I mean, I don't have much time. Have you ever done anything like this before? Once... in Fallujah. Did it work? He didn't make it. Jesus Christ. Okay. All right. Okay, we need some more light in here. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay, let's get this thing up, okay? You ready? One, two, three. ( groans ) Okay, okay. Come on, come on, come on. Ah, so bad. You good? Yeah, good, yeah. - Yeah. - All right. I'm not gonna see what I'm doing here. You know, what, look around and see if you can find - some hydrogen peroxide. - Hydrogen peroxide? Okay, here we go. Okay, got it. Okay, just pour that all over it. You sure? I can't feel my leg anymore, it's not gonna hurt. Okay. Oh, God. We need a tourniquet. That wire-- that blood pre-- - What, this? No. - No, no, no, no. - This. This, um-- - Okay. Yeah, got it, gotcha. All right. - All right, put it around. - Another, one more time. One more time. All right. Okay. Okay. All right. - You ready? You ready? - Yeah, yeah. Okay. One, two, three. Okay. All right, that's good. Okay, I'm gonna cut it right here. Cut it here, man. Leave me as much as you can. I'm losing my fucking leg here. All right. ( chuckles ) Don't make me laugh. It's not funny, man. All right. Okay, Dane. I got ya, all right? - You're gonna be fine. - Of course I am. Good, okay. Better get something to tie me down, so I don't fight you. Okay. I got this. So, when you do this, just do it fast. That blade will cut right through my bone in seconds flat. I'm gonna scream at first. But then I'll pass out from the pain, so when you're done, just fucking pack it in. As tight as you can, okay? And don't take the tourniquet off. You hear me, do not take that tourniquet off. I got ya. All right, got it. Easy, breezy. Okay. All right, you ready? Yeah. - Wait. - What? I need something to bite down on. Oh, fuck. Yeah. - All right, this? - Yeah. - Is that good? - That's good. Hey. I trust you. I wouldn't let anyone else do this but you. Yeah. Oh, fuck. - Okay. - Oh, fuck me. Oh, God. - You ready? - ( grunts ) One, two, three. ( Dane groans ) ( screams ) Hey, man. We did it. You're doing great. Hey-- hey, man. I'm, uh... I'm gonna go get the space suits, all right? Okay? To keep us warm. I'll... I'll be right back. Okay. I got it. ( groans ) Oh. I'll take a little break. I'll get the other one. ( shivers ) Hey, buddy. I'm gonna go get the second suit. All right? Jesus Christ. ( retches ) You can pass me that book. ( chuckles ) "Crime and Punishment." Perfect. Yeah. I don't know what I was thinking. I never even opened it. I don't blame you. Whoever wrote that book should be punished. ( snorts ) You hear that? What? It's quiet. They'll be coming for us soon. I'm sure they'll be here any second. ( gasps ) Will? Yeah? Where are you? I'm-- I'm right here. It's happening. What? I'm scared. It's okay. I'm right here. Where do you think I'm gonna go? Somewhere good. Somewhere better than here. ( sniffs ) It feels strange. Nothing like I'd imagined. ( sighs ) I'll see you soon. Jessie? Daddy, don't let go. It's not time. I'll be waiting for you. Wait, please. Don't go.
