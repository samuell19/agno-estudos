- The earth has been laid waste, fit only for the dead and the damned. A few short years of war and environmental madness have ravaged an entire planet. Paradise turned to Hell by the mindless hand of man. - You hear me? I'll blow her head off! Hear me? I want some more chug! - Pen's dead. - Bang, bang, you're dead. - Nobody has to get hurt, Mathers. - Wrong, everybody has to get hurt. - And why is that? - Because I say so. - Ask him what he wants, Danner. - They wanna know what you want. - They wanna know what I want? You tell them I want. I want off this shit locker! Round and round, and round, and round! - Got a wall climber. Get me a suppression team on alert. - Yes, ma'am. - They answer to my command. I saw something move. There. Brody, insubordinate fool! - Well? - I'm working on it, okay? - He's gonna screw the whole thing up. Brody, back off, that's an order! - I had enough of this hell hole! Get me a shuttle down to the earth right now. - Look buddy, why do you wanna go down to Earth, it's dead! - That's my business! And I want a steak. A real one, none of that simulated bean curd shit. And I'll have her as an appetizer. - No, leave her alone! - You want it instead, hotshot? Get me a medic! I need a medic! A medic! Get me a medic! - You want a medic, you son of a bitch? Huh? You want a medic? You piece of shit. Open up and say ah. - Cool it, put it down, Brody! - Open it up. - I said put it down! Now! - He killed Danner and he killed Pen. - Who made you judge, jury, and executioner? - He did. - Put it down! - All right, Maggot. - Come on, move it. - It's over. - What were you gonna do, Colonel? Negotiate with the son of a bitch? - We could've talked him down! - When? Before or after he killed the woman? - You got big balls, Brody, I'll give you that! But you just tripped over them for the last time. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - We'll let Commander Holden decide that. - Anything to say for yourself? - Sir, I was doing my job, sir. - Your job is to see to the general security of this station, not playing cowboy. - Mathers was on a rampage. - Oh, and you weren't? - Danner and that canteen worker needed bullets, not bullshit. - Enough of this. I've known you for a long time, Cal, and I knew your father before that. He died in the line of duty. Looks like you're trying to do the same thing. - I appreciate that, sir, and with all due respect, if I were my father, we would not be having this conversation. - No more insubordination. - For the most part, you have an excellent record, but this time I will have to take disciplinary action. Mathers gets sent down to the prison colony on the surface, and you get the cryo bay. - Sir? - Three months' rotating duty. - The freezer, sir, you're sending me down with the stiffs? - Colonel Stant here thinks that a spell on the cryo bay might be just the thing to cool off that temper of yours. I tend to agree. - Thank you, Commander. - Thank you, Colonel, it being your idea. - One of my better ones. Pack up your gear and kiss your loved ones goodbye, Captain Brody, unless you wanna lose these for good. I expect you at drop shaft one at 1800 hours. And wear something warm, Brody. It's cold where you're going. - Screw you, Colonel. - What was that? - I said too true, Colonel. - I've seen all this before, Kendall, your so-called ring of fire. - Yes, but you haven't-- - I'm just as tired as you are of spinning around that airless ball of garbage down there, but your theory doesn't work. We've tried three times now. - Commander, there are more than 78 functional satellites in the earth's orbit. If we can run enough juice through them, we can set up a chain reaction and zap the earth, like shaking up a bottle of pop. - I know the theory, Kendall. - It's all hard science. Shake the bottle hard enough and all the inert gases will be released. It works. - Would work, if we had enough energy. We don't. - I don't need the Legacy for power, not anymore. - What? Simulation begins now. - Solar flare? - And the old Hubble Telescope. See, by directing the energy from the flare, we get a massive concentrated laser effect, like an old-fashioned magnifying glass, which shakes up the pop bottle. And then we all go home. After all these years, the sleepers wake. Interesting, but when? - What about now? We have got a flare coming up, a big one. - Which is why I've asked you to be here. - Okay, Kendall, proceed. - Everything's aligned. - What energy level do we need? - Anything over 85% will give us enough. - 35%. 40. 65%. - Come on, come on. - 81%! - Satellite confluence, all systems green. - We're losing it! 78% and falling. 49%. It's no use, Kendall, we lost it. - We'll just get it on the next solar flare, Commander. Commander Holden. - Like you said, next time. - Yeah. If there is a next time. Hey. - Hey. - I heard about Danner, Cal. I'm sorry. - Yeah, well I heard your day wasn't so hot, either. - Maybe things will get better for us, huh? - Don't count on it anytime too soon. - What are you doing? - Packing. - I don't get it. - Stant has reassigned me to the cryo bay. - Oh no. - This nut kills two people, and I get a three month shift down in the freezer, taking care of a bunch of stiffs. - They're not stiffs, Cal, they're sleepers in stasis. - You know, it's probably just one big waste of time. - It's not a waste of time, Cal, they're our future. One day we'll repopulate the earth. One day we'll all go home. - Tell that to Danner's wife, huh? Ah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Ken, I just... It's been a bad day, all right? - It's okay. - I'm sorry, sweetie. Hey, I gotta go. - Okay. - All right? - Come here. Maybe I could give you a few memories, huh? Keep you warm? How's that? - I don't know. - No? - No, it's still cold. - Warmer? - Much. - Get up! - 1800 hours and no Brody. Figures. Go find the son of a bitch and make sure he gets down to the cryo bay. I'll handle Mathers. - You're gonna take the prisoner down yourself? - Do you have a problem with that? - No, ma'am. - That's all. - Shit, I'm late. Knock it off. You keep doing that, I'm gonna go AWOL. - Well maybe you should. Three months is a long time. I'm gonna miss you. - Gonna miss you too. - Cal? Why does Alexa hate you so much? - When Max Durbin tried to organize a mutiny, I figured it out before she did, and I got some hair whip with that. - But he killed your father. - Yeah, I know. I know he did. I gotta go. Okay. - Cal? - Yeah? - It's nothing. - Hey. - What's that for? - That's for luck. - I don't need luck. I just need you. - Already got me. It's for love then, all right? I gotta go. - It's about time, hero. We were about to go fetch you. - What, is that what you do when you're one of Stant's little puppies? Go fetch? - You're a real smart ass, aren't you? - How you doing back there, Colonel? Do you want some help? - If I need help, I'll ask for it. - Want some? - You know, maybe I should. You won't be needing these where you're going. - Stant, go for launch, we are awaiting close. - Attention, shoppers. Got a special in the frozen foods department. Human beings! All shapes and sizes. Get them while they last, only one per customer. Shit. Now you're talking to yourself, great, Brody. If anybody needs anything, anything at all, I'll just be in the next room here, by myself here. - We're coming out of orbit now. Putting up the heat shields for reentry. - Eighth floor, frozen meats. - Hey, put down the knife, huh? Hey, somebody! Easy, pal, just drop the knife. Come on, come on. Let's go. Now stay down, all right? Just stay down, somebody! - You have pre-authorized clearance. - We have pre-authorized departure clearance. We can leave as soon as you finish taking out the garbage. - Cancel Brody's access code. - Jason Trent. Why'd you try and kill me, Jason? Stasis withdrawal? You're supposed to be frozen, buddy. Who got you out of the freezer, Jason, huh? Who thawed you out? - New prisoner? - No, I'm here for the view, jerkoff. - Just what we need, bigger mouths and smaller assholes. - Alexa? The hell is she up to here? Bingo. - Hey, Colonel, what do you got for me today? - Lead poisoning. - What the hell is demex? Uh-oh. What do you guys got in common, huh? - Do it. - Open this damn thing! - We're in trouble. Durbin. - Alexa. - Topside control, this is Brody in the freezer. Come in, topside. Topside control, this is Brody in the freezer. Come in, topside. - I see you brought along the goodies. - I brought you something else. I thought you'd want it back. - Jeez, Max, sorry. - I'm not angry. I'm not angry, I'm not. I love you, Ma. I knew you wouldn't desert me. - You know what they say about old acquaintances not being forgotten, Max. - Who's this? - Nobody. - Thanks for dropping in. - Come along, gentlemen. I have a score to settle. Upstairs. - Access denied. Access denied. - Oh, beautiful. - Come in, Legacy docking control, this is shuttle one on approach. - Is that you, Cassidy? - Cassidy is slightly indisposed. This is Colonel Alexis Stant, security. Do I get docking authorization, or do I shove your head up your ass? - Yes, ma'am. You have authorization, and commence docking. - Just like old times. - Better. - Trouble? - All security controls just went out. - A fault in the system? - I'm not sure. Nothing's responding, all systems are down. - What? That's impossible. What the hell's going on with my ship? - Uh. My ship. - Durbin. - Ahoy there, matey. Long time, no see. What a lad. He needs a painkiller, Pip, could you? - Murdering bastard. There's no need to kill him. - Murder's not a question of need, Commander, just a necessity. - You're insane. - Insane? No. Vision. Clean, precise vision. - What do you want, Durbin? - Oh. Haven't we been through this before? You know perfectly well what I want. - Yes, I do. Your twisted arrogance will destroy any chance we have of creating a new Earth. - Twisted arrogance. - And I will not let that happen. - My mother told me not to say anything about a person if you couldn't say something nice. - Colonel Stant. - Nice retirement speech, though. We'll make it your epitaph. As of now, the USS Legacy is under new management. Complaints? Questions? That's the spirit. Put me on the P.A. I wanna inform everyone that Max is back. - Up, up, up, up! Get up! - Oh my god. C4 explosives. Why do I feel like my day's just begun? - Apathy and weakness have no place in the future. Under your former captain, you endured too many years idly waiting for a natural regeneration that will not happen. That era is over. The time has come to act. Cooperate with me, continue to do your jobs, and I will lead you into a bountiful future. If you fail me, or defy me, then may God have mercy on your soul. 'Cause I won't. - Very nice. - I've been working on it. Status. - All key systems are secure. The ship is ours. - Nothing can stop us now. - Kendall. - What can I do for you gentlemen? - Commander Durbin wants you to get ready to show him your experiment, or whatever it is you do. - A wet one. Just how I like it. - No. Here, the boss wants you to get one of these stiffs, Amos Tucker. - Who is he? - How the hell should I know who he is? Just do as you're told! - Can I get something for myself? - Why bother? When Durbin gets things fixed up on the surface, he's not gonna let psychotic morons like you breed. Get the hell out of here. Sorry to bother you, ladies. For the time being. - We're in trouble, aren't we? - Yeah, big time. - Tucker, Tucker. Mucker, schmucker. Tucker, Tucker, mucker. Tucker, Tucker, mucker. - Oh shit. - Tucker, Tuck. Lucker. - Oh no. - Tugger. - No, no, no, no. - Sucker. - Oh no. No, no. - Tucker. Sucker. Tucker. Anybody home? Hello. - Can I help you out there, pal? - You Trent? - If I'm not Trent, I'm dead meat, right? - Right, right. I don't read so good, you know. Durbin wants this guy up and around right away. - Durbin, huh? - Yeah. He ready yet? - Tucker. No, no, not quite. Why don't you relax? - Okay. - Amos Tucker. - Oh, creepy. - Why don't you just have a seat there, relax, and I'll finish up, all right? - Okay. - Yeah. - Pretty quiet down here. Must get lonely, huh? - Actually, you'd be surprised. - I guess you got all the women you want down here, right? - You bet. Why, you wanna crack a cold one? - Oh, might be nice. - I've got just the girl for you right here. Just take a couple of minutes. You have to strip down. - Yeah, how come? - Well, we gotta cool you off a bit, warm her up some, meet somewhere in the middle, if you know what I, you know what I'm talking about. Can't have you sticking together like a tongue to a frozen doorknob. - Oh no, no, I guess not. So. - Yeah. - Yeah, I should. - You are ready, aren't you? Okay. - I don't see any girl. - Oh, you will. You will. - She pretty? - She's a dream. Open up, open wide. There you go. You ready? Asshole. - Who are you? - Well I ain't the sandman. Why don't you climb out of there, pal. Come on, let's go. - I do something wrong or something? - Well that remains to be seen. - Oh god. - Why don't you put down the stick. - This, it's a Balabushka. - Yeah, I'm impressed, put it down. - God, where the hell are we? - I read your file, sci ops, scientific operations, classified. - My sci ops file? - You're Tucker, right, Amos Tucker? - Yeah, that's me. - What do you know about explosives, Tucker? Hey, you got ice in your ears there? I just asked you a question. - Stop yelling at me. Don't know what you're talking about. - Max Durbin. Tell you what, my friend, I highly suggest you start talking, and now, or I'm gonna find a very uncomfortable place to hide your babushki. - It's a Balabushka. Now if you'll excuse me, I've been out of town for a minute. - Yeah, you're right. I don't know what it is that Durbin finds so special about you. Not yet, anyway. I'll tell you one thing, Amos. You just woke up into a nightmare. - Now that, my friend, I understand. Oh god. - Kendall Black, I presume. - You presume correctly. - My sources would lead me to believe that you have a viable alternative to this environment. A regenerated, reborn Earth, to be precise. - Your sources have good information, not that it matters. - And why is that? - The flare wasn't strong enough. My experiment didn't work. - If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Works for me. - Is that what I'd be doing, Mr. Durbin? Working for you? I'd rather die first. - That can be arranged. For your friend as well, huh? - Let her go, I can't do the work without her. - I want what you want, Miss Black. A planet, a civilization where weakness is a thing of the past, and you can be a part of that. - Let me think about it. - Make it fast. Time is of the essence. I want you to be ready the next time our orbit coincides with the Hubble Telescope. Understand? Oh, something you should know. I've arranged for someone special to be brought out of stasis. He'll be analyzing your particle acceleration theory. His name is Tucker, Amos Tucker, a real scientist. - Hey, is this guy a buddy of yours? - And the asshole was good for something after all. Look, it won't take long before Durbin figures out he's missing, and I don't want you to just stay, don't touch anything, all right? Just lay low, all right? I'll get back as soon as I can. - No, wait, wait a second. Where do you think you're going? - Me? I'm going to look up an old friend. - Well what do you want me to do? - I don't know, play with your stick or whatever the hell it is. - No, no, no, wait a sec, you don't get it, do you? Now excuse me for being a little concerned here, but I've been an ice cube for the past 50 years, so you're gonna have to bear with me. Now you wake me up in the middle of a goddamn mutiny, for what, I don't know, but I'm still stuck out here in the middle of this space station, or whatever you wanna call it. I'm surrounded by dead people, you're pointing guns at my face, and look at this really bad suit I'm wearing. - What do you want? You want an apology, fine, okay, I apologize, I am very sorry, I mean that, I am. I am sorry, this wasn't part of the plan. - You're putting me back. - I'm what? - You're gonna put me back. - No, I can't do that. No, I can't do that! - You thawed me out, you put me back. Freeze me. - Look, I can't do that. - Freeze me! Freeze me! - Look, you don't understand, I actually can't do that. I don't know how. I'm sorry. - Something tells me mankind still needs a little help. Just give me a cigarette. - Sorry again. Tucker, I'm sorry you got dropped into the middle of this, all right, I'm sorry we all got dropped into the middle of this, but there it is. - If this guy's so rough, why don't I just go with you? - No. I work faster when I'm alone. You know how to work one of these? - Look, look, look, no gung ho, okay? - It's just in case, I don't need gung ho. - Well good. 'Cause I don't do gung ho. Wow. - It's showtime. - I notice an excessive interest in this Kendall Black. - Scientific only, I assure you. - Why do we need her? We have the Legacy. - I want more than a broken down space station. I want it all. - So we wait around for Kendall Black to find a solar flare big enough for us? - I have no intention of waiting for any solar flare, no matter how large. No. Power source is right here. - The cryo bay reactor? - Exactly. Kendall's theory, but with the reactor instead of the solar flare. - Sheer genius. - Maniac or not, he may be our only hope. - You can't be serious, wanna cooperate with him? - Did you see the look on Stant's face? She would have killed me without even thinking about it. Yes, I say we cooperate. At least for the time being. - Okay, for the time being. - Boss. - What do you want? - It's about our old boss. - Yes? - We seem to have lost him. - Then perhaps you'd better find him. Now! - That's a good plan, boss. - I thought you said these were your best men, Max. - Good help is so hard to find. - Goddamn that Earl, can't he do anything right? Rainey, make your way down to computer control, go see if that peckerhead's gone off playing with himself again, huh? Krypler, come with me. I swear to god, that guy really gets on my nerves, I try to help him out. - Disgrace me, will you? Back, slag, or I shall give you what you really deserve. And I shall turn you with the rushing tip! Silence, fool! - Trent. Earl. - They're not here right now. - Who are you? - I'm Tucker, Amos Tucker. - Really? - Mr. Tucker, how nice to meet you at last, I'm Durbin. Max Durbin. - The pleasure's mine, sir. - Pardon me for saying so, but I was expecting someone a bit more analytical. - Really? Thank you. - You are a particle physicist, aren't you? - Of course I am. Particles are my life. I know everything there is to know about particles. I'm the best. Go ahead, name a particle. You wanna know about a particle, I'm your man. Go ahead, I'll show you. What particle you wanna know about? Go ahead, come on, ask me about a particle, go ahead. - Yes, that's fine, thank you, Mr. Tucker. When Mr. Trent and Earl come back, would you do me the honor of joining me on the bridge? - Oh, I'd be delighted. - Good, good. So much to ask you. - Count on me, sir. - Flick. - You're a fruit loop. - Still not sure we should be doing this. - Doing what? - Durbin's back, he's taken over the ship. - Tell me about it, he's got about 10 tons of plastic explosives strung up and down drop shaft one. - Why would he want to separate the cryo bay? What does he gain? - I think I know. A power source. - Power source for what? - Cryo bay reactor. - He's not gonna wait for another solar flare, he's going to initiate the satellite sequence by blowing the cryo bay. There's no time to explain, but he's gonna test my theory by blowing the reactor. We've gotta stop him. - All right, look, the explosives are wired into the main electrical system. Can't you just flick a switch or something? - No, not without setting off all sorts of alarms. - What about the central computer? If Durbin has the detonators wired in the main electrical system, then they have to be controlled through the computer, right? - Right, he won't be able to set off the explosives if we took the command circuit board out of the main computer. - But... - But what? - The main computer is submerged in a cool grescent pool. It freeze to death in a minute, two at the most, it's impossible. - Kendall, how do I recognize this thing? - They're color-coded. The one with the blue tab operates the command system controls. - All right. - Don't let him go. - You come back safe, okay? - Never say die, ladies. - Earl! Earl! When I find that inbred, cousin-screwing, pig-banging, mother freaking, bunched up idiot, I'm gonna rip the skinny lips off his ugly face. Or maybe I'll just shoot him. - Everything quiet? - Yeah. - Huh? What'd I tell you? Earl, you gotta cut this shit out! - Hey Giz. - Sleeping on the job, Earl? - Closed. - Huh? - Open. - Jesus! Rainey, this is Gizmo. We got a situation here, Rainey. Come in, goddamn it! Shit! You stay here. If anything moves, kill it! - Everything's under control. Only a few more minutes. - Kendall Black was telling the truth. She didn't have enough power from the solar flare. Where the hell's Tucker and Gizmo? - They haven't shown up yet. I guess they're still down in cryo bay. - I'm surrounded by fools. - Woo, surprise, surprise, fat boy! One move and you're wasted. You moved. Okay, pal. Help me up. Let me introduce you to a little friend of mine. She's a little skinny. But boy, can she dance. Here comes the fun part. Say goodnight, sweetheart. - My computer just went down. - Mine, too. - Memory download? Durbin is stealing our data from the satellite sequencing. - We've got the memory download. Soon as it's complete, you can start the sequence. - We're coming into orbital position with the laser blasts now. The Hubble Telescope should be coming over the horizon line any second. - A new world born. My paradise. - There's nothing more we could have done, Kendall. - 90 seconds. - Cal. - Convergence in one minute. - Then God set them in the firmament to give light upon the earth. - You're not God, Durbin. - Oh no. Not yet. - 30 seconds. 10 seconds. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. - Three. Two. One. Nothing happened. Nothing. - I don't know what's going on. - Boss? - What? - Maybe this isn't a good time. - Talk. - Earl's dead, boss. Real bad case of freezer burn. Trent's dead, too. And Springer is, well, he's also dead. I think something bad is happening, boss. - The master control circuit board, it's been removed. - Who would dare? You sent Brody down to the cryo bay, didn't you? - Yes, you said-- - Did you check to see if he'd been dealt with? - No, I... - He has to be here. Find the son of a bitch! He wouldn't have known which circuit board to remove. - Unless you wanna lose these for good. - He must've had help. - Here's your traitor, Durbin, in the flesh. This belongs to Brody. - When Robin Hood comes back, tell him I've got his Maid Marion. - Sit down. We have missed our chance this orbit. I don't wanna miss it next time around, do you understand? - Yes, Colonel. - Good. - I've got it, Celeste. - Cal. - I got the circuit board, where's Kendall? - Ah, the man of the hour. Just spending some quality time with her sugar daddy. - I'll see you in Hell, Durbin! - Spare me the melodrama, Mr. Brody, and I'll spare your lady wife some delicious pain. Meet in the canteen, five minutes. Bring the circuit board, and let's make this as pleasant as possible, shall we? We both come unarmed. - You have to give the circuit board to him, he'll kill her if you don't. - He'll kill her if I do. - What are you doing? - I'm hedging my bets. - You're gonna trade with him? - Right after I kill him. - You confuse me, Kendall. You could've shared a world with us, but instead, you choose to protect a man like Brody. - It's called love, Colonel, and loyalty, and honor. Not that I'd expect a woman like you to understand words like that. - And what about strength and power? Hm? And lust? - You disgust me. - You'll come around. - Oh shit. - Gotcha! - Stupid, stupid! Oh, you wanna play? You wanna play with me? You wanna play? - Gonna break! - Life sucks. - An alpha particle considered as a massive point charge, with the conditions which will be used to determine the values of energy in the stationary. Alters the state vector, discontinuity, abstract space. The vectors move according to this equation. This simple calculation should take no longer than two minutes. Time starts now. - Hello, Max. - No weapons, Mr. Brody? - You said come unarmed. - Indeed I did. - Two against one? - Oh, ye of little faith. - And in your case, none at all. Let's get on with it, shall we? You have Kendall, I have your precious circuit board. - Fair enough. How do we make the exchange? At the moment, we seem to have a bit of a standoff. - Things are not always as they appear. - What have we here? - Well I figure you to be the type of person that would appreciate a game, Max, so I took the liberty of creating one of chance. It's a shell game. I'm sure you know how it works. Under one shell, you've got a circuit board, under the other shell, you have absolutely nothing. Under the third, and this is where I change the rules just a little bit, I got an old-time bouncing Betty mine with a trembler switch. - Ingenious. One wrong move-- - And you're dead. - So I hand over the young lady, and you tell me which dish is which, correct? - Something like that, yeah. - What if you don't tell me the truth? - Oh, ye of little faith. - He's bluffing. - Try me. - It's true. Never say die, Brody. The circuit board on the table is a phony. This is the one you want. - Durbin. - You made one serious mistake, Mr. Brody. A bouncing Betty mine jumps four to five feet straight up before it detonates. The only thing it'll do is blow up the ceiling. - You should've told that to the goon that you planted. His luck's running out. - But yours is about to. - Brody! Where can we go? - The shuttle, it's our only chance. Gotta fly it. - So you know how to fly this thing, right? - Ordered the mail a couple times, but I never took the test. - So we ride without a license. - Damn! We missed them! They're getting away! - They'll be coming around the port side laser array in about five minutes. Target practice. - Excellent! Why can't you think on your feet like that? - You trust her? - You know I can't tolerate failure. - I love you, Max. - Love hurts. Come along, Celeste. We have places to go and people to kill. - It's no use, the automatic sequence is locked in. - How long 'till we reach the lasers? - Three minutes. - Can you pull us in a lot closer? - Yeah. Not much, though. Why? - Maybe we can get too close for comfort. - There they are. - Shoot them. - They are too close. The blast will damage our hull. - They didn't fire. - We were too close. The blast would've taken them all out. - I want them dead. - In 30 seconds, they will pass in front of the drop shaft's pose. Time the explosions right, and the shuttle will be destroyed. - Do it. - Hey, maybe we're gonna survive this after all. - Don't be too sure about that. - Now. - We did it. - How long will it take you to readjust the satellites? - Not too long. Too bad we had to sacrifice the cryo bay. - We all have to make sacrifices. Some of us are worth making sacrifices for, don't you think? Come. We'll share paradise together. - And if I don't want to be on it? - Then I'll just have to persuade you a little. - Kendall? Kendall? My god. Kendall? Hey. Hey, you all right? You okay? - Yeah. - You all right? - Yeah. - Are you hurt anywhere? - I'm okay, I'm okay. - You sure? - I'm okay. - You sure? - I'm fine. - Jeez, you scared the hell out of me. - It works, huh? Brody, what's the damage here? - It's not good. We have about 20 minutes of air. We haven't got enough fuel to flush the toilet. We blew it, I blew it. I don't know what to do, all right, I don't. I don't know what to do. - So you're just gonna give up now? - I just, I can't shoot my way through this one. Durbin won. - No he didn't. Not entirely. I still have you. We still have each other, right? Yeah. - The hell was that? - Docking completed. Airlock certification authorized. - Docking? Docking what? - You look like you need a little help, man. - Tucker. - Wow! Hi, I'm Amos. - Hi, Kendall, Kendall Black. Amos, Amos Tucker? This is the guy that Durbin needed to analyze my theory, to make sure that it worked. - Kendall, can Celeste pull this thing off on her own? - Okay, wait a minute, quick, who's Celeste? - No, Celeste is just winging it. - Winging what? - Kendall's theory. Now can you help us? - Not a chance in Hell. - Why not? - One, I don't know what you're talking about, and two, I think you got the wrong Tucker. I'm Amos C., for Charles. You want the particle physicist, my twin brother, Amos E., for Edward. - Hold on a second, you told me you were a scientist. - Well technically you told me I was a scientist. - Why didn't you say something? - You had a gun in my face, you freak! - Listen, pal, if it wasn't for me, you'd still be a popsicle. - Can you help us? - Eddy and I share some of the same interests. I mean, it's all angles and velocity, she just played on a cyclotron, I play on a billiards table. - Of course, billiards. - Pool, actually, nine ball. Tournament level champion, Cueball Tucker at your service. - Oh great. What are we gonna do now? - Look, guys, guys, the Hubble's gonna be converging with the Legacy any minute now, all right? If they're gonna blow the cryo bay, it's gonna be then. - Blow the cryo bay? - This may be a long shot. How's your game, Tucker? - Wait a second, who's blowing the cryo bay? - Come on, we're running out of time. - Are we almost ready? - Just a few more minutes. We need some distance between us and the cryo bay. - I'm gonna name an entire continent after you. No, better yet, an entire hemisphere. - Brody, are you sure about this guy? Couldn't we, I don't know, wake up his brother or something? - No, no way, there's no time. We'd have to find him first, and then defrost him. He's all we got. - Hey, it's all coming back to me now, it's kinda like riding a bicycle. You never forget this stuff. - Can you do it or not? - Like I said, it's all angles and velocities. It's geometry, ballistics, just go do your thing, I'll take care of this. - Don't mind me, come on, let's go. - Four minutes to initiation. - You believe this? Leaving the fate of the human race in the hands of a pool shark? - Well you know, geometry, ballistics. Maybe he's right. - Well. - Three minutes. - Hey, just be cool right now. And hope they don't got a shot. We're right behind the Hubble. - Sure we have enough power for this? - Based on Tucker's angle, we should be able to make one pass. - And if the angle's wrong? - Then it's game over. - In a second, you have to call your shot. Side bank in the corner. - What? - When you goose your engine a little bit, you're gonna get the perfect amount of speed. You know what to do. - Like this? - No, no, easy, easy, back up a little bit, that's too much charge. - How's that? - Okay. All right, that's not bad, looks like you're gonna have a future at this game. - Coordinates are locked in. - This is no sprint, guys. This is easy. Eight ball in the corner pocket. Now! - Now. - Arming lasers. - It's aiming at the Legacy. - Yeah. - If they fire now, they'll blow themselves up. - Now. - Something's wrong. It's backfiring. - Fix it! - I don't know how. You said we'd share paradise together. - Go to Hell instead. Another world, Ma. On top of the world! - You all right? You okay? - It's amazing. It's gonna work. - Oh no, no. The cue ball's coming back at you, you're gonna tear up in what's left of the atmosphere. Give it some sun, pal. - Guys, what, speak English, man. - Pull the nose up or you're gonna blow the whole game! Hey Brody, you guys down there or what? - Yeah, yeah, we're here. - Woo, baby, I think it worked, 'cause this planet's going crazy! - Yeah, like inside of my head. - Like I told you, eight ball in the corner pocket, right? Oh and by the way, it's only gonna take me about a year to figure out how to defrost the cats that can land this thing, so don't wait up for me, all right? - A year? What are we gonna do by ourselves down here for a year? - We'll think of something. - Hey, look.
