Carlos, we're waiting dinner on you. - I'm not hungry. - You are 30 minutes late! You shouldn't have taken my phone! I'm busy. Hey, put on a shirt and come downstairs. I said, "I'm not hungry." Well, that's fine, don't eat. You still gotta come downstairs. We gotta sign you up for those online classes before tomorrow. I don't wanna take online classes. Well, this is the consequence of cuttin' classes - at your last school. - Great. No, it's not great. Now you can either sign up for those online classes or go to military school. You can't make me do that. Oh, yes, I can. You are 16 years old, you're still a child. I'm not a child. Then quit actin' like one. Now put on a shirt and come downstairs. Yes, sir, colonel! Oh. He's not hungry. I worry that he's not eating enough. That's what worries you? Carlos! Yeah, I gotta run. Carlos. We can talk about school tomorrow. Nice fit, Carlos.

Eh, no ball tonight. - Some dance show. - What? Yeah, some Christmas in August party. I don't know. We just gotta sit through some random dance, and then we can get some free shoes, free backpacks, iPads, all of that. - You serious? - Mmhmm. Here, have another one. Whoa, I'd slow down.

Show's about to start, come to the gym. Thank you, thank you. Thank you for comin' out tonight. Uh, we're creatin' a brand-new version of the Nutcracker, usin' hip hop and all sorts of different dances.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Y'all, break it up! What y'all doin'? Mind your own business. No, eh, no, this place is my business. It's ours, too. Man, not when you're a drunk mess, man. I can smell your breath from here! Hey, come on. Hold on, hold on. Back up. Oh! Carlos, put it down! Put it down or go to jail. It's all about choices, Carlos. Your bad ones started when you decided to drink. But you made a good one back there at the end. Why do you care? It's my job to care about good kids like you, so that you don't go to jail for makin' bad decisions. I'm here to de-escalate, not incarcerate. What makes you think I'm a good kid? You dropped the sword. Here, take my card. You and I will be keepin' in touch. Whatever. Drink some water. What... what's going on? Carlos, escúchame! Carlos! You don't come to class, you miss your assignments, you don't focus, you don't listen. Carlos! Carlos, what are you doing? - Carlos. - Carlos. Carlos. - Carlos. - Mom? - Carlos. - M... mom! Oh! What's going on? Carlos, your grandparents... I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to my grandparents. Well, that's a surprise. You haven't communicated with us since I invited you into this house. - Invited? - Yes. When your mom got sent away, we invited you into our home, but you have treat us with complete disrespect. Carlos, we love you. - We're trying to... - It's not working. You're kicking me out? Are you serious? We're only here to talk about options. No, I don't have to put up with this! You walk out of this room, you'll be in military school for the next two years of your life. Would you like to hear about your other option? Carlos, I'd like to introduce you to your father Dross Meyer. Hey. It's great to finally meet you. It took your mom getting arrested for your grandparents to finally reach out to me. But I'm glad they did. I moved my work here, so I could be closer to you. I want you to come stay with me. You guys never even talked about this guy and now you want me to live with him? They didn't come up with this today. Your family's been talking about a way to best support you now for months. The guy that walked out on me and my mom, your daughter, that's my best option? I may not be your best option, but aside from military school, I am your only option. ♪ I am always ♪ Hey. ♪ Treading water ♪ Hey. What you listenin' to? You wanna plug in and share? You wouldn't like it. How do you know? Try me. It's not stupid ballet music. I told you last night, I'm not makin' a ballet. I'm creating a new version of the Nutcracker that empowers different cultures to tell their own stories. I don't care.

Great, now you've ruined Star Wars. ♪ It's like I'm always treadin' water ♪ You're just like Grandpa. Hey, hey, I am nothin' like your Grandpa. No, you're exactly like Grandpa. You didn't give a crap about me till mom got locked up. Your grandparents stepped up when they didn't have to. So now you're defending them? Hey, they kicked your ass out, too! I'm not defending anybody! Just sayin' there's more to it than you know.

Alright, man, let's go. What? Yo, this is nice! Come on. Oh. Hey Carlos, get... what do you need? Chairs? Yeah, like four chairs, table. Yeah, get four chairs and a table, and set 'em up here stage right. This right here though, y'all set this up? Oh, this is nice. What's takin' so long? Uh, I... I don't know. I don't even know what chairs you want. Plus, you'll change everything around anyway. Not if you do it right the first time. So grab some chairs, put 'em stage right. Stage right? Where's the stage? You know... Look, you know what I'm talkin' about. You see us outside creating a space for the audition, a stage-like space. I'm doin' the best I can and you're just... I'm what? Just get some chairs and bring them outside. We'd like to say thank you for giving us this opportunity to bring our traditional dance into an old story and make it our own. I teach tradition, not addiction. Historic pain, being stomped out. This old story as new dancers emerge. - Oh! - Oh! Hohou/Nie'she! Yeah, it was so good, man. It was nice meeting you, Carlos. Hey Carlos, get this stuff put up, alright? I'ma go talk to 'em. Need help? Whatever, man. What's your problem? I don't have a problem. I don't wanna trip over your stupid crap. Thi... this isn't crap. It's not my job to pick up your chairs. No one asked you to. Why you being such a punk? You callin' me a punk? - Hey, stop! - He was being such a j... I don't care, get in there! Hey, what happened? I don't even know. - Carlos. - No, he started it. No, you're tryin' to create chaos. I get it. Alright, you don't wanna be here, but that does not give you the right to lash out at someone and assault them. Oh, so now you're takin' his side, huh? I'm not taking any sides. This is my job. Whose side are you on? Whatever. Hey, I think you two just got off on the wrong foot. Carlos was just about to apologize. No, I wasn't. Fine, I'm... I'm sorry. Me, too. I don't know how it got so messed up. Thank you. Hey, I'm sorry. No, it's alright, man. He's a missile lookin' for a mark. He's angry. Hey, so were you, so was I. Come on, man. We were breakin' knuckles just like that before we started breakin' for fun. And now look at you, huh? Legislator. I don't know if I can do this. Come on, man, you can do it. Just take it one day at a time. One day at a time. You stay in the car. What? Aren't we eating? Yes, but I'm getting it to go. You wait in the car. I thought you were so jacked about this place. You've been talkin' about the tacos all day. I know. But now I'm gettin' it to go and we're gonna eat it at home. - Why? - 'Cause you picked a fight. If I can't trust you at my work, how can I trust you with one of my oldest friends? It's all over, we made up. It's not over for me! I have to have a modicum of trust for you. Dude, what's even a modicum? Startin' place. Ground zero of trust that you're not gonna bow up at everybody in your path! Dude, you suck! Uh-huh. Maybe next time. What am I supposed to do with this? Fix it or buy a new one. How am I supposed to do that? You'll start tomorrow mornin', workin' at the rec center. What? Yeah, I told James about your fight in Concho. He's puttin' you on probation. You're workin' for Reggie. While you head back out on the road, huh? Just like old times. No, actually, I'm staying here, watchin' auditions online. That's stupid. You're right, but I don't really have a choice. You're my responsibility now, so we have to stay put until we can figure out how to get along. You may be here a while. Well, I got plenty of time. See you at 6:00 a.m. Whatever. Get up! It's time for work. I'll see you downstairs. You a coffee man? Yeah. Have at it. Question. Why was your pillow in front of my room last night? I was worried about you and couldn't sleep well. So I camped in front of your room last night. Why? You think I'm gonna run away? I wasn't worried about that yet. Now I am. Are you gonna run away? No. Good. One less thing. I really am not tryin' to fight with you. I just wanna keep you safe. By keeping me a prisoner? Come on, you didn't even know I was out there! You want more coffee? Yeah. Have at it. Officer James will be here in 10 minutes. No, I wanna ride my skateboard. It's probation, not camp. Be ready when he gets here. Good morning! Reggie is excited to have your help this week. Thank you so much for bein' so flexible. You know I'd rather see you all in person. Hey, D Money, it's me. You're doin' the right thing. Besides, my son's a maniac with his new camera. - Hi. - He's dyin' to show it off. So do you wanna talk about your concept or just dive in? Let's dive in. No, actually, wait, I'll tell you. Our approach to the Chinese dance is about the annoying tendency to label all Asians as Chinese. Wow. Really? Yeah. When people are mad at China, they yell at me in the grocery store. And I'm Korean. So our dance breaks down the caricature of the original Tchaikovsky version to reveal the diversity within all Asian culture. Wow! That's not the direction my mind was headed in at all. What did you expect? I thought you were gonna lean into the model minority stereotype. But this... this is richer. You're kind of a genius, you know that? No, just Asian. That's the cool part about letting people tell their own stories. You ready? Let's switch into the camera. She hasn't been doing the things yet. I just got done outside. Is that all? Let me call you back. Come have a seat. You did a really good job out front. Did you give any more thought to what we talked about this mornin'? You mean that creepy shed? No. I mean what happens to you when you get angry. No. Okay. That other night when you got in trouble here and I yelled at you to stop fighting. Would you like to learn how to stop yourself? I guess. You guess? So you just wanna keep gettin' in trouble and keep fightin'? No. Did you know that when you get angry, you stop breathing? I hadn't noticed. You're doin' it right now. You're shoulders are tight, and you're becoming more agitated and more uncomfortable. When you don't breathe, your brain can't work. Your decision maker, your pre-frontal cortex, needs air to function. No air, no good decisions. So take a deep breath. Man, come on, seriously. Do it. Take a deep breath in. And breathe out. How'd that feel? I... I guess I feel more calm. You look more calm to me. So is that all? No. But it's a good start. I... I get a tablet? Sort of. There's no internet on here, but this device is filled with great resources available to you anytime you need 'em. Like this really cool breathin' app I think you should check out. Okay? Let's get you home. I got your audition papers. Is that all today? Not by a long shot. Come on. I've mowed lawns and pulled weeds for two weeks straight. What's it gonna take for you to trust me? Well, I'm about to trust you with these expensive posters and two of my most important dancers. Give you a chance to work on those peer-to-peer relationships. Hello? Uh, are you Dross Meyer, the director? Yes. Oh, good. Uh, I'm gettin' this setup for my dad. - Yeah, me, too. - Oh. Yeah, thank you. Uh, Carlos. Clarissa. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. So uh, you a dancer? Yeah. Well, I guess I better go get my dad. Yeah, okay, right. Uh, nice to meet you. You, too. Dad, fixed it! Hey, how's it goin'? I'm Daniel. Carlos. I saw you guys at the show. You guys are good. Thanks. Ah, my good friend, Carlos! That's right, you're workin' for me today. Come on. ♪ Check, check, uh ♪ ♪ You make me wanna feel it, shuffle the deck and deal it ♪ ♪ You double down, make me the clown ♪ ♪ Slap off my crown and steal it ♪ ♪ But I come back much stronger, don't fear you any longer ♪ ♪ It's nothin' now, I double down ♪ ♪ Pick up my crown and move around ♪ Alright, hey. So we're gonna start here, work up to 36th Street, then back down. Sounds good? - Great. Yeah. - Alright. - How're you? - Doing good, doing good. Oh, right back there. Alright, sounds good. Come on. Ooh. Wow. So how do you guys even know my dad? I've been watchin' his videos online since I was little. What videos? You don't even know about your dad's dance videos? Man, give me that. Trippin'. Are you sure that's him? Your dad is the reason why I started dancin'. It's definitely him. Too bad I didn't know he existed. Do you need something else? - Oh, actually, I was... - Oh, excuse me. Actually, I'm Carlos's boss uh, Michael. By any chance, do you dance? Yes, I do actually. - I do Mexican folkloric. - Okay, awesome. Well, we'd love to see you at the dance audition. Tell your friends. You guys want me to go in and get us pocket shots? They're the cheapest in town. Are you tryin' to get your ass kicked? Just kidding. Man, it's not funny. Look, you can't drink and dance. Your dad taught us that. Yeah, the absinthe addict. Yeah, your dad, the recoverin' addict, who overcame a ton more than you have ever faced. Who made himself great. Man, let's see what you do. Oh great! Smells like spaghetti, again. Yeah, I make my own sauce. I know, four days a week. But homemade. How'd it go today? It was good. Uh, I think Michael's still pissed at me, so they kinda treated me like their... Work horse? Yeah, their work horse. Um, so can I ask you a question? Shoot. Who was that girl on the meeting that you had today? There was a girl? Yeah. Oh, that girl. Yeah, her dad runs the Mexican Folkloric Company. So can I go to that audition? We'll see. We got another trip tomorrow and if that goes well, maybe. Maybe? Yeah, maybe. I can work with maybe. Alright. Wash your hands, man. Go say "hi" to my dad while I get set up. He's in the wood shop. You're not goin', too? He knows you're comin'. But where... Hey, you got this. I believe in you. Hello? Carlos? Let me see that Nutcracker. Um, pass me the wood glue and that rubber hammer. Uh, Dross says you can fix anything. He looks a little beat down, but not defeated. How'd you break this soldier? You're a little old to be playing with toys. I uh, broke him in a fight. Hmm, fighter, huh? I guess. I was a fighter till I got all the fight knocked out of me. Vietnam, right? The war and after the war. Put a little wood glue there. Like PTSD? Whatever you call it, I was broken. I wasn't there for your father, so I lost him. I thought my grandparents made him go away. He wasn't their responsibility. I wasn't there for him, so he wasn't there for you. But we're all here now. You make all this stuff with your hands? Mmhmm. Well, uh, maybe one day you could show me how? Oh, I'd like that. I think your Nutcracker will live to fight another day. Should we go and see what your dad's doin' with the really old people? Nice to meet you, Carlos. Since we don't believe in limitations, our dance is about all the unique physical skills each of us possess in every phase of our lives. I'd like to say something, too. Now I would just like to thank my son for making us a part of this show, and most importantly for bringing my grandson to meet me. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. D... do you think I'm gonna become an addict? Uh, I... I don't know. Do you think you are? I don't know. What's got you thinkin' about it? Well, um, you, mom, and grandpa, all have the same problems. I can't keep myself out of trouble. Oh, Carlos, man... Our history doesn't have to dictate your future. I... I think you're angry, sure, you... You got some anxiety, you're startin' to self-medicate. That does not mean you have to keep goin' down this path. You have to learn how to make better decisions. Your mom and I cannot make them for you. I haven't seen mom since she got arrested. Okay. Do you want to? I think so. Alright. Alright. Nice to see you guys. Uh, hey, water? Um, no, I'm fine for now. Uh, is there anything you need? Hi, how're you doing? How're you doing? No, thank you. We're fine over here. Jorge, Adelita, that's my son Carlos. Uh, hey. Hey. I'm excited to see you dance. Don't. That's just gonna make me even more nervous. Oh, s... sorry. It's okay. Um, so you work with your dad? Yeah. I'm basically his... the... the assist... The assistant director, so... That's cool. Yeah, we just go around, travel and... and stuff. Cool. Clarissa! Folklorico is storytelling in dance. We were drawn to the music of the Spanish Chocolate in the original. Spain had invaded Mexico centuries ago, so their culture is already deeply embedded in ours. But cacao and chocolate were already part of the indigenous Mayan culture. So when we stomp, when we get low, we're connecting with our Mayan history. Hey Carlos, we're gonna break for lunch and have a chat. Do you wanna come or stay here? We packed a lunch. Do you wanna share with me? Sure. We'll stay. Okay. You were great out there. You didn't even seem nervous. Oh, my mom taught me to dance to help with my anxiety. You have anxiety? Yeah, my parents just expect a lot from me. School sucks. Yeah, school does suck. My dad thinks I have anxiety, too, so... Really? What do you think? I... I don't know. But maybe your dancing can help me. Maybe. Okay, dance is all about breath. Okay, but why is everyone so obsessed with breathing? My mom says the fastest way to calm yourself is the easiest. Breathe. Great job. Now hurry up, I'm gonna be late for work. Sorry, I forgot. I have to go. What's up? Nothing. Why're you in bad mood? Doesn't matter. Nothing ever works out for me. What about Clarissa? I think she has a boyfriend. You think? Dude, you have got to learn how to deal with adversity. You can't just give up anytime things don't go your way. Says the dude who left for 16 years. Yeah. And all 16 years of those years were filled with adversity. But you're right. I should have been there. It took me way too long to get here, but I made it here today to be with you. One day at a time. I'll be right here if you need me. Hi honey! Oh God, I'm so glad to see you. Oh! Um, do you wanna sit? Okay. So you and your dad, huh? Well, how's that going? What's it like? It's good. Um, I met Grandpa Joe. We're going around, looking at acts and stuff. It's pretty fun. Good. I'm so glad. I uh... uh, I... I talked to my parents. They said you've been having some trouble. So? What do you care? You're not even there. I care, because I'm your mom. You're not taking care of me. Honey, there is nothing I would rather do than to be able to take care of you. But right now, I have to take care of myself, so I can be a mom to you again. Why wasn't I enough for you to stop? No, no, no, no. It was never a choice between you and the drugs. I... I understand if you don't believe that right now, but it's a disease. I promise I am... I am trying, honey, I really am, and I'm learning. You know what? Have fun learning in your little resort here. Carlos, please. Hey man, how di... Uh, I wanted to make you your favorite dinner, but I don't know what that is. So I decided to make you mine. Roast chicken, mashed potatoes. You didn't even cook this. That's why it's my favorite. Do you wanna talk about what happened today? No. You know, parents aren't perfect, but sometimes, they can surprise you. My dad, he kept all my clippings. He gave this to me. That's me when I was in Man of La Mancha. I had no idea. Yeah, cool book. Good thing you left, right? That's not what I meant. No, but it is. You left, you made your own way. Good for you! But you know what? Mom left, too! Both of you left. You left me. That's not what I'm... I wasn't in a place... Carlos, what's up, man? You okay? You need somethin'? Nah, I'm alright. Here, take a few of these. Oh, sick. Oh, you want somethin' stronger? Nice. Yeah, and no vape smell either. Now these are pretty strong, so you wanna be home whenever they hit.

Sorry, it was just hectic up there. I needed some space to work. What... what you're workin' on? Casting. Casting, casting... Casting. I thought you were done, though. Uh, I'm almost done, but it's a big cast. I still need a Prince. I've been dancin' with Sugar Plum, but uh, - I'm too, uh... - Good? Old. Nah. The Prince has to be much younger. If I move Michael, then I lose the Mouse King. Let's head on home. Oh wow, you're on time! Yeah, you know, I'm feelin' this vibe. But just all by myself. I'm not sure if it needs to be with a Prince, you know? Or maybe you could teach me. - You wanna learn? - Yeah. - Really? - Yeah. - You think you can? - Yes. - You sure? - Yes Alright, top eight, watch me. Flow. Here. Let's take it from there, on my count. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, and... Flow. Loosen up. Watch me. - Are you ready? - Yes. You're ready? Do it with me? 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3. No, no, Carlos, you're not listening. You said you're ready. - Are you listening? - Yes. Let's try it again, on my count. 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1... Flow. Oh! Step aside. You need water. You know, I've been thinkin' a lot about you lately. You remind me so much of your dad. You remind me of me. How's it goin' with your mom? I uh... I haven't gone back. Hmm. Do you ever go for a walk after a big storm? No. I mean like on my skateboard I guess. Okay, so imagine. You're skating through a park after a big storm. What's it feel like? Wet. Great. So you're skating along, the breeze is mostly gentle. You notice a few leaves, branches on the ground. It's the calm after a storm. Suddenly you hear the pitter patter, raindrops pick up. You post up under a tree. But your face, it's getting wet, it's uncomfortable. You panic. Time to go home. There must be a new storm on the way. Or... is it the breeze shakin' loose remaining drops in the trees. See this isn't a new storm. Just the memory of an old one. Just the leftover drops hanging on until the fresh wind shook 'em free. Okay, question. Um, am I the storm or am I the trees? Neither. You're still a kid skating around on your skateboard, but like the tree. Honey, you're gonna go through some storms, you may lose some leaves and maybe even some branches, but you hold on to what you need, and allow fresh wind to shake free the rest. The bottom line is this. You gotta shake off all that weight, all those drops that are holding you down. Don't you wanna be free? Dance free? Forgive your mom, your dad. Forgive yourself. Carlos, believe me, to be able to live in total freedom, you've got to let the past stay in the past. I am really glad you came back. I'm sorry I didn't come to see you. That's okay. You didn't mean to... Wait, let me finish. I'm sorry for the way that I acted. I'm just so angry. It's okay. You have every right to be angry. I messed up and I hate that we're both paying the price for it. I miss you so much. I miss you, too. Hey. We're gonna get through this. Hmm? Okay. 5, 6, 7, 8.

Uh, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1, 2, hit, 4, 5, 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, hold. Alright, let's go. Okay? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1, 2, 3, uh. Carlos! If you can't stop distracting my dancers, then go on home! We're workin' here! No, no, you said I was on the schedule this afternoon. You said I could show you all those... I know what I said! And maybe tomorrow. Or you can show me whatever it is when we get home tonight, but right now you need to go! Okay. Let's take it back to the top of the second 8, alright? Carlos, slow down, man. You finally give up dancin'? Back to actin' like a real man? You're a real man? More than some stupid dancer. Whatever. You're lucky that didn't break. Phew. Hey James. Yeah, it's me, Carlos. No, nothing's wrong, I'm okay. Uh, I just wanted to say that I tried that breathing thing, it worked. It's okay... not great. Alright. Thank you. Hey man, can I come in for a sec? I'm sorry I didn't make time for you today. It's okay. No, it's not. You've been doing great. I... I just got so caught up in everything. I'm very proud of you, though. Why is that? Well, I blew you off and embarrassed you today, but you handled it like an adult. How do you know? Well, you're home, sober, don't appear to have been in a fight. Uh, I talked to James today. Yeah? That's great. How'd that go? It was good. I told him I remembered about my breathing and that's what kept me from punching Dustin, so... You did the single hardest thing any one person can do. I asked for help. You asked for help. You remembered that you weren't alone. Well, even though, I was alone. Hey, you are never alone. You know that? I'm proud of you, son. So tomorrow? Are you kiddin' me? Yes, you're gettin' your audition tomorrow, Carlos. Yes! Goodnight. Goodnight, dad. I brought some friends to see you. Thank you, guys, so much for... for everything. Oh! I'm sorry. No, they're perfect. Nice jacket. Clear it out, folks, we're starting the show. Shouldn't you be somewhere? Hey, I knew you could find stage right. And thank you for ever... No, you did this. And you worked hard, you made it happen. Turns out you made something cooler than Star Wars. Not a bad ending, right? Oh, no, son.
