Got the money. Leave it on the sidewalk, let him pick it up. Grab your weapon! Don't come any closer! "The lethal slash" I'm still waiting for my food. Will be ready soon, miss. Never mind, I don't want to wait. Surely all of us have wandered down the memory Lane... In the dead silence of the night. But yet we must move forward. Why don't we focus on the future instead? Be careful! Thanks mate. This machine could cut five bowls of noodles per minute? Give me a hand, push it inside and plug it in. Be careful with it. Uncle chau, could I have a word? Uncle chau, this is your last day. Did I do something wrong? Customers are walking out because the food takes too long. Just take some time off. I've received a hand-written letter today. A listener named "fung" said she misses "chau" and "chung", we're the invincible trio forever, even we've been out of touch. In the letter, fung wrote, Time for Meet up for the greatest s? Hope chau and chung will look her up if they're listening... What's the rush? Don't worry, I'll be fine in a sec. Just listen to me. Take a break. I don't need a break, I said I'm fine... What now? I'm off... - Off? - Yes... So soon? It's about time... I didn't want to hold you up. Still got some time. I don't want to get a parking ticket. I'm off... Wait, this's for you. Takeit let me pay you back. No worries, it's a gift. Let's meet up sometime again. I'll show up no matter what. I'm off then... I have endless dreams blooming like the summer Rose giving youth a boost you have boundless imagination who hasn't lost one's bearings? Be confident! Be passionate! Be free of sorrows! Embracing youth let's take flight and shine never afraid to cry, be carefree and without woes we sing the song of youth, joining hands I have endless dreams blooming like the summer Rose - boss. - Yes? Dance with me. Which of us is doing the poking? I'm only teasing you. Stop it, come on. Embracing youth let's take flight and shine never afraid to cry, be carefree and without woes we sing the song of youth, joining hands Embracing youth let's take flight and shine never afraid to cry, be carefree and without woes we sing the song of youth, joining hands Time flies, show me your "heart" before we say goodbye! Wow! Must be holding some serious grudge. I doubt she could last long anyway, is that necessary? How have you been? You don't look so well. You wouldn't either without all the makeup. Drink some iongan tea with dried goji berries. You could use some of those yourself. You're off too? It's me... I'm right here... I want to take a last look at her... Just... go back inside... What the hell are you trying to play here? Can't afford her medication, death is better than debt... Take care of yourself... Hopefully you'll be born into a good family next time. Where's she? Getting groceries. I'll pay you back tomorrow. What happened? Failed mission? Let's get off and split. The old woman asked for assisted suicide. Really? Fung, why didn't you tell us? Are you new in this business? You know it's confidential. Did you just let her go? You chickened out? Say that again if you dare! We're lucky to be called for gigs. It's good to have some sort of income. Hop in. I'm pass in future! No need to cook tonight. Can we trust on your wife's cooking? Mum said we're eating out. I still haven't done my makeup, there's no time! Don't worry, I only booked for three. Take your time. So? Are you ready? Mum's waiting. Police are investigating a suspected murder in sham shui po today. A woman, whom required long term care, was found dead. The police have arrested the victim's husband. A person at the scene confessed that... He couldn't afford the victim's medical fees. Both deep in debt. Life is tough! Some have criticised the government's health policies fail the elderly. A programme on this topic will be aired shortly. You could be doing them a favour. There's nothing worst than being bedridden for life, trust me. You're very old as a hitman. Sor... sorry I mistook you for someone else... "Guardian angels of the elders", right? I'm doing live streaming. Hello everyone... Give me back my phone! My phone! I'll pay you back. I'll pay you back! It's just a few dollars, don't worry about it. There's an empty seat. Don't mind me! The old man probably lives alone. He does. No visitors for years. He doesn't even return my greetings. Hello, can I help you? Do you live here? Could you show me your ID. Please? - It's at home. - Which one is yours? Hey! He just left me here, Mr. Policeman. How are you two related? He's my grandpa. I'll get you arrested if you keep wandering around. I've lost my phone. No idea where it is. I've set my picture as wallpaper. Where did you lose it? Did you take my phone, grandpa? Give it back! He has dementia, and keeps forgetting his medication. Keep a close eye on him. Yes sir! Give me back my wallet! What's with the attitude? Tin lap-chau! I'm off, bye... How did you find me? Through "look my phone" app. Coward! I want to die! I want to die! - I want to die! - Shut up! Or I'll silence you for good! All mouth and no trousers. Where's my picture? A bunch of useless bums! Whom're you referring to? I'm starving... I don't know how to delete pictures on an empty stomach. "D" what? It's "delete"! You old-geezer. Fine. Deal. Should we call him? We should just try to find him. Let's wait another day, we'll be doomed if the police shows up next door... Ugh! That's disgusting! Are you blind? Hand-cut noodles with chicken in wine sauce and tofu puffs. Is it poisonous? Would I stoop so low? "D" the pictures. You... Come on buddy, help me to "d" the pictures. "Dh? "D" the pictures! Oh, delete. Done. Why can't you keep your word? Young and old, all the same. I won't kill a minor. I'm not a minor! You'd be fine if you weren't in my way. We're even. Hey. We were so worried about you. Never underestimate me! He punched back? The only person you should worry about is yourself. I've no choice. At our age, we could only buy time with money. Come on out, we need to talk. - What's up? - Come over. - Sit down. - What do you want to talk about? Have a seat. Hayhay, is there something you want to tell grandma? I'm going to an interview. What was that? Interview for school admission. Great! What a smart boy. Let's celebrate by going for a dimsum treat. But I've a prior engagement. Hayhay wants to treat you to dimsum. Hayhay? Come on! Come on! Your grandson loves you, just go. You're the boss, sweetheart. Well then, let's go. Wait. Grandma is so forgetful, just go ahead first. I forgot to bring the iai see. Join us soon then. - Grandma will give you a iai see later. - Go on, bye. So forgetful. Are you trying to make... A fashion statement here? I'm busy today. What's with your head wound? Who will snoop it out first? I could tell the client to postpone. My grandson wants to treat me to dimsum. You've got some balls showing up here. You'd be dead if it's not for me yesterday. A load of nonsense! I just want to have a look at you... Happy now? That's impressive, killing a croach like that. Do you live alone? I live alone too... It's sad to live alone... Hmm? What now? Aren't you hungry? Happy now? Yes. Just have a rest. Dessert is here. Just get lost. It's my first time cooking for someone. Do I need to regurgitate it for you? Damn! Do you have to go that fast? I've medicated oil. Keep an eye on her. Sure. This place isn't hard to locate, I've been waiting for so long. I'm on time. Come over here. It doesn't make any difference if one is rich, all will end up like me in one's old age. I really don't get it, my kids don't mind taking red-eye flights. But they complain I live too far, when I ask them to visit me... Do you have any kids? You're very talkative. Sorry... I haven't had a chat with someone for ages... Come on now, don't make my wife waits... You would want your grandson to have a bright future. No, it's not for sale. The school might offer hayhay a place, our future is counting on my boy. I also had wishful thinking like that once. It's a blessing to have a grandson who is moving up in society! Would living in a posh neighbourhood makes one top of the class? Are underpriviledged kids destined to be losers then? Your son is a loser! - Working as a cashier at your cabaret! - Calm down! - Being a mamma's boy for life! - Don't be angry. Have a seat. Get lost! Have a seat. Come on, son. Just reassure your grandma. I'll make lots of money and will take care of you, grandma. Your grandson is so nice to you. By the time comes, grandma would be dead... Yes! Just rot in your flat for life! That hurts. Couldn't be, I was careful with the solution. Give your face a wipe. I need to catch my breath. Was I better than usual? Same. What? No way! As long as you're happy. A little quick, but with great intensity. Should we go to Disneyland? I'm not a child. But I am. Aren't you tired of your "work" life? I'd go to Disneyland with you if it opens overnight. The truth is... I would like you to be my wife. I just want you to be my client. Don't you want to have... Someone to take care of you for the rest of your life? Shouldn't you be asking yourself that instead? You should find a more mature woman. Chung-chung! Are you okay? One, two, three. Where were you? The fridge was empty. Come with me. Leave your stuff here. Excuse me, I'm looking for yip yat-chung. - No. 4 bed, the hallway. - Thanks. Nurse, I didn't receive any medication earlier. Again? Or you've just forgotten that you've taken it? No way, I would have some sort of reaction with medication. I didn't take any. Please follow up for me. Hello, chau. Girlfriend? Your "body" still working! Is she going to stick around though? Giving him medication again? He said he didn't take it. - Here's your meds. - Thanks. Doc, I'm ready to be released from hospital? - Mr. Yip, right? - Yes. I've arranged a follow-up appointment... For your diabetes next month. As for your hearing problem, I'll transfer you to the ear, nose & throat specialist. But you'll have to wait till the latter half of the year. It'll be a year and a half's wait for your knee caps. Whoa! And try to avoid those... Intense bedroom activities. Too much for your heart to handle. Sure I could cut down on the intense bedroom activities, could you please try to arrange the other appointments sooner? Should I try to book those for you at private practices? No thanks, I like the hustle and bustle here. In that case just keep on waiting. Thanks doc. My eyesight is failing too... I've a gift for you. This will spice things up in the bedroom. You're weak and have too many hobbies. You'll need it more! We might have long past our prime but still got to get our engines running. - Yes. - For two. Sure, just a sec. Let's order this one. Too sweet. I'd like to have a lotus seed & egg dessert instead please. We don't have that. Noodles. Go ahead, try some. It's yummy. Are you feeling unwell? I'll take you to the doctor's. Just shut up and eat! Just keeping you entertained. Do you have any protégé? Why don't you teach me? The machine churns out five bowls a minute, you'll never make it. I want to learn the flying blades. What for? You're so skilled. It would be a shame if you die without passing it on. Have you no shame? What now? Are you thrilled by embarrassing me? We've discussed this before. What do you want me to do? At least we've the a cabaret, it's something to be proud of... How could our son answer the headmaster's questions? That his grandma serves a bunch of vulgar male customers, and you work as a general worker there? Have you considered my feelings? What could our son say? Tell me! Why don't you talk to her then? Time for soup. Good boy, come over for your soup and stop playing. It's a waste of the mask with all your wrinkles. Don't even bother. Have some soup. Where're you off to? Back to my parents'. Only good at throwing tantrums. Ask your mum to join us for dinner. No need to waste food on the ungrateful. So immature! Just wait and see, she'll be back in two days. Are you messing around with me? Bring hayhay back! How? She said my son will have no future here. Is it my fault? So it's my bloody fault now? Are you happy now that my wife and son left me? You only care about your wife. I'm not happy either! Why don't you stand up for me? You've been living off me like... A blood-sucking parasite for decades! I don't owe you anything! Don't blame me for all your problems! You brought me into this world, of course you're responsible. Or try shoving me back into your womb. You're a terrible mother! Hey uncle chau. - Put it there. - This's complimentary. A token of appreciation. - Thanks. - Just a little? We're friends. Never mind, that's just a piece ofjunk. Call me if you need anything. Be careful please, expensive stuff. Give it an extra layer of wrapping. Life is short, death is sure. You might be blessed with many kids, but they could turn out to be a burden. Just live your life to the fullest while you could. Or there will be nothing except regrets... Stars coalesce under the blanket of night by the stars maple leaves slumber I remember when, under the starry night we shared cups of lo ve but the stars gather no more, and crimson leaves tumble into the gales and leaves / cry who drove him away?

In the soundless n/ght Spend it wisely. It's just awful to be old and broke. Are you alright? Take it as a bonus. Give it back if you don't want it. It's getting late, you should leave soon. Excuse me, miss. Please wait here. Excuse me, miss. What're you doing here? I'm waiting for someone. What could I do for you? I'm waiting for my grandpa. Hello? Where're you? Is everything okay, madam? You're her grandpa? - Could you show me your ID. Please? - He've told you already, must you check? We've noticed that she's been standing here all night. Different surnames? She takes her mother's surname. This's embarrassing! Just go home with your grandpa, young lady. Where's the blade? Beat it if you wouldn't tell me! I've no place to go... Go back to your parents! They're divorced... Neither of them wants me... Are you making this up? It's the truth! Ben is the only one I've... But that bitch is so clingy! That's why you're thinking of killing? So are you! I'm helping others. Then help me stab that bitch to death! He's not the only man on earth! He's really gorgeous... This isn't the place for you, just leave. He ghosted me after hooking up. No fucking idea of what you're saying! You're always speaking in martian! I'm pregnant! Stop lecturing me! I'm worried to deal with this on my own... How could I take care of the baby... No answer. Ms. Choi, as our vip customer, we've a special gift for you. What kind of special gift? Where're you? It's chau. Where're you? I'm in the UK. It's time to eat, choi fung. I've moved to the UK. Spit it out! Or I'll sever our ties! The environment is not bad here. Where're those two brats? I got rid of them. Do you have something to tell me? Tsz-ying got knocked up. Your girlfriend got knocked up? So you're trapped? She's my grand-daughter. Where's the wedding invitation? The brat ghosted her after hooking up. - Huh? - He left her after sleeping with her. Oh... I want something to eat. - Are you that hungry? - Yes. What are you doing? Ouch, that hurts. Hey! What're you doing? - What're you doing... - It hurts! What do you want? Help! Come on, let's go. What's going on... I just posted it, and you don't want to sell now? Taking a last look. Don't worry, I'll look up properly. Hey! The dragon and Phoenix dance. Whip it up and slash it open. Shit! The coffin opens... Within three whips. Oops! The coffin opens! Have you got the wrong door, old man? Tsz-ying is pregnant. What's your plan? I've treated her to a bts Show... I'll treat you to a special show, "body worlds". What're you trying to do? Stop! It's burning! You know what they do to sexual offenders in prison? Once you're there, you'll surely be well loved. Don't be mean to her again! I wasn't... Too stingy to buy condoms? She wasn't against it... You could still say "no" yourself, kid. Exactly! Must we teach you what to do? Be on your best behaviour. Or I'll cut it off. And minced. I had no idea. Hold on. Hello? Lower your voice, he could hear you. I'm off to bed, bye. He called? I just ignored him. He just couldn't live without me. Should I introduce him to you? Why bother? So skinny! I wouldn't have known you if I were dead. Other than Ben, you care the most for me. When I get married in the church, you could give me away... We'd walk down the aisle... And then I'd say "I do"! You could name my baby too. What should I name my baby? I'll make sure my baby knows you're family. And you could teach the baby flying blades and noodles cooking. So blessed! Will you miss me? We're not that close really. You said that I'm your granddaughter! I'm not delusional like you. It's official, you're my family! Ching-ching? - Ching-ching. - Have you recovered? Yes, it's boiling outside. I'll get married after I retire in two months. So you've finally come to your senses. Where should we go for our honeymoon? He's macanese... Macanese? What about me? I'm not in good form today... Let's take a rain check... Is he young? Have you picked a wedding venue? I really like you, but it isn't love... I'd say that to girls back in elementary school... You're sound asleep, I better not wake u. My babe has been so nice to me, it's all forgiven now. No more chillaxing from now on. Thx 4 teachin' me how 2 cook, or he'd tease me that I know shit-all.

Not much, I'm just waiting to go pee. It's cold, put a coat on. They don't cook the rice properly here, I wouldn't eat after two bites... Where's chau? Tell him to cook some... Never mind... Time to get off. There're plenty of people here. Don't worry, this's your hood. They're way below par. Let's go and play, better than rotting in the nursing home. Chicken? Say that again if you dare! Chicken! Ladies and gentlemen, fung is the only person... I look up to after spending years here. Do you remember her? Life is short, death is sure. Damn it! Are you cursing us? Why don't you just fucking die already? Bravo! As long as we're happy. I'll take you out for dinner in a few days. When? On my day off. Thanks... Where're you working? Security. Sign here please. Here's the money. Thanks. Welcome. Come on in. No thanks... I'm so swamped... It's for you, before I forget... I wish you a lifetime of marital bliss... Will you forget about me? Chung-chung... You deserve all the happiness in this world! Everything will be fine! I'm still busy... You said that you wouldn't leave me. Well, since I'll staying at the dorm, who will take care of you then? You don't need to worry. Who will then? I'll raise my baby on my own. We'll get married when you graduate! Are you sure you want the baby? Or I could go to prison! Do you still love me? I do if you don't nag. I'm the new security guard here, my last name is yip. I'm excited to be here. Hey, wakey wakey! Stop sleeping! Did I doze off? Sorry sorry sorry! Low blood sugar level...

But it's your first day. Yes, it's an emergency. I've to go... save someone. You've one foot in the grave, and you're saving someone? Hello? Chau asked for help. Forget about picking you up!
