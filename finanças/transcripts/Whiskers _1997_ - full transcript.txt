>> Adult jed: When you're 11, you believe in magic... At least, you're supposed to. But the summer that I turned 11, when we moved into a new house, with a new school, in a new neighborhood full of new, weird kids... That summer started out as anything but magic... And if you'd have told me then that a boring trip to a museum would lead to the most magical adventure of my life... I would've probably thought you were nuts. >> Mrs. Gordon: On behalf of the staff and myself, I'd like to welcome you and give you all the support you need in adjusting to your new environment. [ Sneezes ] Excuse me. Though we are a public school, we like to think of ourselves as progressive... Flexible enough to accommodate the needs of any student. But, uh, there are a few rules, and one of them is no cats in school. >> [ Meows ] >> Hal: Well, of course, the cat's not gonna be inschool. >> Jenny: We just moved, and jed's feeling a little... >> It's okay, mom. He doesn't like this school anyway. >> Uh, jed, uh, we have to, uh... Do some paperwork. Do you and whiskers wanna go outside and-- >> [ yowls ] >> [ Gasps ] >> Oh, no! Whiskers! >> Oh, my! >> Whiskers! >> Sorry. >> Jed: Whiskers! >> I'll just go get those registration forms. >> [ Sighs ] Should never've let him bring the cat. Am I wrong? Am I? Is there like a sign around his neck that says "I'm a weirdo"? >> Did you see all the clubs they have here? >> Yeah, and we should sign him up for every single one. That way, he'll be too tired to play with you-know-who. >> Maybe he'll get interested in girls. >> First, he's gotta get interested in humans. >> Whiskers! >> [ Meows ] >> Yeah, hi! >> [ Meows ] [ Meows ] [ Meows ] >> Hey! You the new kid? >> Wanna play some ball? You know how to play ball, don't you? >> Yeah, I know how to play ball, but we--we gotta-- >> we? I meant you, not the cat. >> He thinks his cat can play ball. What a weirdo! >> Let's get out of here, fingers. >> So... Nice kids? >> [ Sighs ] >> I'll go get your mother. >> [ Meows ] [ Purrs ] [ Meows ] [ Meows ] >> [ Rain falling ] >> [ Meows ] [ Meows ] >> Hey, whiskers. [ Rings bell ] Whiskers. >> [ Meows ] [ Meows ] >> Careful, honey, and be back in an hour. Your father's taking you to the museum, remember? >> Bye, mom. >> [ Yowls ] >> Jenny: Have fun! >> [ Yowls ] >> Jed: Hey, watch out! >> [ Horn honks ] >> [ Yowls ] >> Whiskers! Come back! >> [ Yowls ] >> Whiskers! Stop! Whiskers! Whiskers! Whiskers! Oh, great. [ Sighs ] >> [ Meows ] >> How'd you get over there? >> [ Meows ] >> No way, I can't. I can't jump across that. Now get back here! >> [ Meows ] >> Come on, whiskers! >> [ Meows ] >> Ew. Whoa! Ugh. Ugh. Whiskers... Get back-- whoa! Ugh! Ugh. [ Laughs ] >> [ Meows ] [ Meows ] >> Okay, okay. >> [ Meows ] >> Now, you listen to me, whiskers. I've gotta go to this stupid museum. Last time I left you alone, you messed the whole place up and I got in big trouble. Okay, it's not funny, so don't... Ugh. Ugh. >> So when do we tell jed? >> [ Sighs ] I don't know. He's gonna be pretty upset, and it's natural. >> He's so used to whiskers... And having US. >> Look, there's no easy way to break the news. We'll tell him in a week and that's it. >> Shh. Hal... Jed? >> [ Meows ] >> Come on. >> [ Meows ] >> I'm not gonna let them take you away. >> Hal: Hey, jed, are you coming? >> [ Purrs ] >> Well, here we are... At the boring museum. Come on, jed, I'm just kidding. It's not boring, it's Da Vinci! He wasn't just a great artist, he invented some really cool stuff. >> I know, dad, thanks. >> If we'd waited a day later, we would've... Oh, no. >> Oh, wow! >> [ Sighs ] >> "The home of the Egyptian cat goddess was located at bubastis in the delta, site of the great temple of of bastet. The goddess bastet, whose earthly form was that of a cat, was considered a... A bene... Ficent goddess." Dad, what's Ben... >> Beneficent. It's, uh, helpful. You ask her for things, she helps you. >> "Was considered a beneficent goddess, the protector of all cats. Cats were sacred animals in ancient Egypt, and it was considered a serious offense to harm them." >> What are you looking at me for? >> Nothing. >> Look, you're gonna be here for a while. I'll meet you over at the renaissance room. Think you can find me? Okay. >> [ Whispering ] Uh, hi. I have a cat. Well, I do now, at least. But I think they're gonna take him away. I mean, they can't just do that to your best friend. You're a goddess, right? And you protect cats, don't you? So what about mine? What if you-- you changed him into a boy? Then they couldn't take him away, and he could talk to me, and we could do stuff together and-- >> [ bang ] >> [ Purring ] >> You're--you're gonna need his name, right? Okay, his name's whiskers. >> [ Whooshing ] >> [ Rumbling ] >> Hey! No touching the exhibits! >> [ Purring ] [ Purring ] [ Purring continues ] [ Eating loudly ] [ Purring ] [ Purring continues ] [ Purring continues ] >> [ Yowls ] >> [ Purring ] >> [ Yowls ] >> [ Sighs ] Whiskers! [ Sighs ] Jed... >> Yeah? >> I'm going to get milk, be back in a minute. Whiskers made another mess! >> You up yet, whiskers? [ Screams ] >> [ Screams ] >> [ Both screaming ] >> [ Screams ] [ Yowls ] >> Get out of my room! [ Yowls ] >> Get out of my room! Who are you? >> [ Screams ] >> Get out of my room! >> What's happened to me? Where are my claws? What are these useless things? Oh, no, wha-wha-- what's this lump in the middle of my face? Where is my fur? Ugh, I'm hideous! >> Who are you? >> What have you done to me? I mean, i--i used to be the-- the best looking cat in the neighborhood. >> Whiskers? >> I--i think so. >> I can't believe it worked! >> What worked? >> But you're supposed to be a boy! >> What--what do you mean, I'm supposed to be a cat! Oh, I knew it! It was that garbage from the Chinese food. My mother always said never, never eat takeout. You don't know what is in it. >> Jed? Are you okay? >> [ Gasps ] >> Yeah, mom! I'm just waking-- waking up whiskers! >> Okay, breakfast in five minutes. >> You were supposed to be 11 years old like me! >> No, don't say that. I'm just three years old. >> Now I get it! Here it is! Three cat years is around... 30 years human. That's what happened. Wow. Cool! >> Hmm? >> Good? >> Great! But I'm still hungry. >> What else would you like? Eggs? Toast? >> No, sardines. >> [ Chuckles ] >> Whoa. Whoa. Whoa! Hey! How do you... How do you stand up whoa! Hey. >> Whiskers, these fish. >> [ Sniffing ] Ooh. [ Grunts ] >> No, it's for you. >> [ Grunts ] >> No, not the fork! >> [ Gags ] >> [ Chuckles ] >> Uh, whiskers... We gotta talk. This is how humans get clean. First you run the water. Then you take your soap. See? This is soap. Whiskers? Whiskers? Ah, yuck! >> Jenny: Jed? >> Come on! >> Jed? >> [ Panting ] Quick! Out the window! Come on! Come on! >> [ Yowls ] [ Groans ] >> You okay? Grab that branch! >> [ Grunts ] Whoa. [ Grunts ] >> Time to get dressed. >> Okay, mom, I'll be right down. >> [ Screams ] >> [ Crash ] >> [ Groans ] >> Crazy cat. >> Jed? Time to clean the lawn. >> Now? >> Yes, right now. >> [ Sighs ] Whiskers? Whiskers? Ugh! Can I go now? It's all clean! >> Bye. >> Whiskers! Whiskers! Whiskers! Whiskers! Whiskers! [ Rings bell ] >> [ Birds chirping ] >> [ Grunting ] [ Grunting ] >> Whiskers! Hey! >> Hey! [ Grunts ] >> Where have you been? I thought you'd hurt yourself! >> Hurt myself? Hey, I'm a cat. I know how to land on all fours. [ Grunts ] Hey, watch this. [ Grunts ] Hey. >> Wow, where'd you learn to do that? >> I've been watching humans through the windows. Whoa! Yeah, I've seen them walk. It's so simple. And I have been listening, too. Whoa. I think I'm beginning to understand this-- this talking stuff. Listen. Clean your room! You clean your room! How many times have I told you-- >> shh! >> Well, you now, I heard that a lot. And, hey, come back to bed. I'm feeling romantic, and some other stuff. Wow! Oh! All these words, they're coming out of my mouth, and I don't even know how they got there! You know... You know, I think I could get to like this... Being human. >> Hey, wait! I gotta get my bike! You can't just go chasing after birds like that. I mean, it's weird. >> Well, you eat birds-- big birds, chickens. >> Well, that's different. We don't chase them around. Wha... Whiskers, what are you doing? >> I'm, uh... I'm marking territory. >> Well, you can't do that. >> Why not? I'm a cat. I gotta Mark territory. You know how many other cats have hit this pole since yesterday? >> Look, we're people. We don't have territories. >> Hey, cat boy! >> Yeah? >> Didn't you see the line? >> What line? >> Crewcut, he didn't see the line. >> Hey, cat boy, are you blind? >> He's not blind. He's stupid. You're on the line right now. >> I don't see any line. >> So? There's two of US, and we see the line. >> Well, my ca-- companion here, he's bigger than both of you. And he's-- he's... >> What's your companion gonna do, sniff US to death? Listen, cat boy, this time, we're gonna be nice. Next time, you owe US each a dollar for-- for, uh... >> For "niceitude." >> Yeah, for "niceitude." Understand? >> Yeah! >> [Laughs ] >> [ Laughs ] >> [ Laughs ] >> [ Laughs ] >> Hey! Hey! Wait up! Hey. Wha--what? I'm not supposed to sniff? I can't sniff? Okay, okay, it's the birds, right? Well, okay, I promise-- I promise I'll never look at another bird again. Huh? Huh? >> What's the matter with you? Why didn't you help me back there? >> What? What? What? >> What? What? You're supposed to be my friend and help me. Help me. >> What's "help"? >> Help, you know. When two big guys are hassling me, you come and fight them with me. >> What, and get hurt? >> Well, yeah, maybe. >> Well, well, what's in it for me? Nothing? >> No, it's not nothing, it's friendship. >> You're kidding, right? I mean, this is some kind of human joke, huh? >> No, it's not a joke. >> [ Chuckles ] Well, that is the dumbest thing I have ever heard. >> I'd do it for you. >> Like I want you to? I am a cat! Cats don't help each other. Well, you get in a fight, you hiss, you snarl, you look at the other guy, and if he's bigger than you, you get off his territory. You don't make a big deal about it! Humans! >> You know, it's been awfully calm around here today. Where's whiskers? >> I've been training him. >> Training him? >> Yep. Yep, to be quiet. So you won't even know he's here. >> Oh, so let me get this straight. He'll be quiet when he breaks the dishes. He'll be quiet when he pees on my drafting table. >> Hal, stop it. Jed, are you finished? >> No, I'm still hungry. Can I have another burger? >> No fork? I--I've been thinking about that help thing, and I remember that when I was just a kitten, my mother used to do stuff for me, you know, just 'cause I was little and, uh... And she never got anything for it. Is that... Is that help? >> Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry I yelled at you. >> Well, uh, yeah, and thanks for the burger. >> [ Chuckles ] You're welcome. And by the way, we eat these with our hands. [ Chuckles ] Good night, mom. >> Night, sweetie. >> Okay, we're out of here! If my parents catch US... >> Stick with me, kid. >> This better be good. Tell me! Where are we going?! >> We're gonna see some friends of mine! >> Yeah! >> [ Meows ] >> [ Meows ] >> [ Meows ] >> [ Meows ] >> Where are we? >> Cat land. >> Wow! >> Follow me. >> This is so cool! >> Hey! Hey! >> [ Meows ] >> What's going on? Hey, hey! It's whiskers! >> [ Meows ] >> Awesome. >> Remember me? >> [ Meows ] >> [ Meows ] >> [ Yowls ] >> Hey, rust bucket! Hey! Remember we shared Chinese takeout right from this garbage can? Hmm. >> Hi, rust bucket. >> [ Meowing ] >> Okay, so the spare ribs were a little off. [ Hisses ] >> [ Meows ] >> [ Chuckles ] >> [ Meows ] >> Tough being in a new neighborhood. >> Tell me about it. >> [ Sighs ] >> Whoa! Wow! >> Hmm. >> What? >> I'll show 'em. Get in. >> [ Chuckles ] Oh, yeah! Whoa! Whee! [ Chuckles ] >> [ Chuckles ] Hey, you bums! >> [ Meowing ] >> Only a cat can do this! Wall, here I come! >> Whiskers, what are you doing? >> [ Grunts ] >> [ Laughs ] >> [ Grunts ] >> [ Laughs ] >> [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] >> [ Laughs ] >> [ Grunting ] >> Just give up! >> [ Grunts ] >> [ Crash ] >> Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! >> Whiskers! >> [ Groans ] >> Whiskers? [ Laughs ] Well, that sure convinced them. >> [ Yowls ] >> It's this stupid body! It's not good for anything! It's not good for jumping! It's not good for hunting! And I have this bone in my back that feels like a tree! [ Grunts ] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's good for one thing, isn't it, huh? It's good for yakking. Yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak. >> [ Meowing ] >> I'll get it this time. Hey, I'm leaping! >> Wow! >> Hey, told you I could do it. >> Cool. >> Now it's your turn. >> Me? No way! >> Yeah, yeah. Come on! Come on. >> Look, I'm no good at this kind of stuff. >> Up. Up there. You see yourself. >> Where? >> Up on top of the wall. >> [ Scoffs ] >> Jump! >> [ Groans ] >> Hmm. Try again. Jump! >> [ Groans ] >> Ah. >> Thanks for nothing. >> Well, at least you tried. We'll do it again tomorrow night, huh? >> Tomorrow night? Are you kidding? What is this, some big thrill, seeing me covered with junk? >> I'm trying to teach you how to leap. >> Yeah, well, I don't want to. Why don't you teach me something useful. >> Useful? Jed... Leaping is everything. I mean, to leap, you need strength, imagination, courage. And when you leap, for a single moment, you're the best you can be as a cat. And a cat is master of every situation. A cat is brave even when he doesn't feel brave. A cat walks in, looks everyone straight in the eye, makes the place his own. >> [ Chuckles ] >> You're right. Jed does seem better. I think he'll understand. >> I would've felt the same way. >> Hey, what's going on in there? >> Shh. >> Hal, I think we should wait a little longer. >> No, we've already decided. We'll tell him Monday. >> How do you think he's going to feel? >> I don't know. >> Well, I don't know either. By the way, did you call the vet? >> Yes. Come on. >> What are they saying? >> Nothing. >> I'll be up soon. Night. >> [ Sighs ] >> I can't sleep. >> I gotta talk to you about something. [ Sighs ] >> Whiskers? >> Uh... I, uh, I... Oh, god, she said this would be the hard part. >> Who's she? >> Don't interrupt me, okay? I, uh... I need your help. [ Sighs ] >> Help? Help with what? >> Okay, okay, there. There, I said it. Well, I'll tell you, but don't laugh at me, okay? >> Okay. >> Well, you remember about, uh, three years ago when, uh... When you took me from the animal shelter? >> Yeah, you put your paw on me through the cage. >> Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. My mom told me to do that. You know, she was always looking out for me. She said, "hey, that looks like a good kid," so I whacked you when you went by. Well, that was the last time I saw her, right. >> I'm sorry. >> Well, don't be. She'd be happy for me. I have a good life with you. What? What's wrong? >> My parents... I think they wanna get rid of you. >> Wanna get rid of me?! But I am a great cat. Why? >> Well, you know, I guess 'cause, you know, you pee on the rug and stuff and 'cause, well, I'm no good at making friends. And they blame you for it. >> Jeez. Well, what are we gonna do? >> I did do something. I saw this cat, well, statue at the museum, and I wished that you'd be a boy so they couldn't take you away. >> You made a wish to bastet, didn't you? Oh, no. >> Is that bad? >> Humans aren't supposed to wish to bastet. She's a cat goddess! >> Well, my wish came true. So maybe it was okay. >> But I don't think it was your wish, just your wish. >> What do you mean? >> I made a wish, too. >> You what? What kind of a wish? I promised my mother that, when she was old, that I would take care of her the way she took care of me when I was a kitten. >> Oh. >> Well, you know, you say a lot of things when you're a kitten. So I made a wish to find my mother again. And you know, the next night, bastet came to me in a dream, and she said that I should ask you to help me. [ Chuckles ] But she didn't say that I would have to be a stupid human! So you see what she did? She mixed our wishes. Unless she has a plan that we don't understand. >> Well, I don't understand it, that's for sure. But I'll help you find your mom, like you wished. >> Wow! And I'll teach you how to leap. >> How to leap? I didn't wish for that. >> Well, I don't know, it's the best I can do. >> [ Both chuckle ] >> Deal? >> Deal. >> Whiskers. >> [ Whispering ] This is where we look. Don't touch anything in here. Here. Ugh! >> Hey. >> Oh, great. How am I gonna find you in here? [ Sighs ] >> Wow. [ Grunting] >> Hey, control yourself! >> [ Hisses ] [ Grunting ] Whoa! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! >> Whiskers! Oh, whiskers! [ Sighs ] Wow! Here it is! Whiskers? It's my dad! Come on! Come on! Come on! >> [ Whistling ] [ Sighs ] Whiskers. >> We'd like to see records on every cat you had here during the summer three years ago. Are you okay? >> It's peak season for drop-offs. Mitchell! There'll be some forms. >> What kind of forms? >> Pink, yellow, blue, green, whatever, filled out in duplicate. One form per file, one file per cat. >> One file per cat? How many cats did you take during that summer? >> A few thousand. >> A few thousand? Look, maybe you know the cat we're looking for. I mean, maybe she's still here! Whiskers? Whiskers? >> Mmm. >> [ Clucks ] >> Whiskers! >> Help! Please! No! Mitchell! >> Whiskers! >> [ All screaming ] >> Get back here! >> Whoa! Whoa! Here I come! >> Hey, hey! >> Whoa! Whoa! >> Stop it! Well, you really did it this time. >> I don't know what happened. Something just came over me. >> [ Sighs ] >> Look, I may have this body, but I'm still a cat inside. >> And how are we gonna find your mom now? They're never gonna let US back in there. >> You'll think of something. >> Okay. Okay, let's get organized. What's her name? >> What? Oh, I don't know. I used to call her, uh... Me... Me... Meow. Meow. >> Okay, what does she look like? >> I don't know. Just like your typical mom. Ox... Or... Ox... >> Ox? Ox what? >> My mother said... If we were ever separated, somehow she would find her way to... Ox... Or... Ox... Or... >> Oxford? >> Yeah! Yeah, Oxford! >> No way! >> Why? Why? Why? What's Oxford? >> It's a place for really smart people, not cats. >> Calling my mom dumb? >> No, no, it's a school! A school for people! >> Look, if my mother said she went to Oxford, she went to Oxford! >> Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Okay, maybe she really did go, but how does a cat go to england, on a plane? My dad said I could use his credit card number in an emergency. Well, this is an emergency. >> Humans. >> I need the number of Oxford university. >> [ Phone rings ] >> Oxford zoological laboratory, Dr. Forbes speaking. >> I got him. >> Hey! Hey! Let me speak to all the old cats! >> Give me that! Hi. Is this where you keep the smart animals? >> Oh, why, yes, lad. For instance, my rat cordelia here is learning to play chess. And damn good she is, too! >> And what about cats? >> Cats, yes. Some brilliant English cats here. >> Only English cats? >> Well, we do have some north American cats. Not as sharp as the British felines, of course. [ Laughs ] >> Oh, wow! Then maybe you remember one! She was brought there about three years ago from shelter number 727. Hello? Hello? >> You're serious, aren't you? >> Well, sure, I'm serious. >> Look, lad, I'll be straight with you. Any cat that came here three years ago is no longer with US. >> Hey! Hey! What's he saying? >> This is a zoological laboratory. We perform experiments here. Do you understand, lad? >> Yes. >> We're trying to find a cure for brain disease. >> Oh, thanks. Gotta go. >> Does he know her? >> Terribly sorry. >> [ Sighs ] >> Well, does he know my mom? What'd he say? >> He said... To try the shelter again. >> What? >> [ Sighs ] >> What? That's all he said? >> They only had English cats, whiskers. Give it a rest. >> [ Siren wails in distance ] >> Look, we're not gonna give up. I mean, maybe your mom really didn't make it to Oxford. Maybe she got adopted by some great family. >> She said Oxford. She's getting old. What if she can't clean herself? Or defend herself? Jed, I promised her. >> And I'm promising you... We're gonna find her. >> [ Hisses ] >> I hate this place. >> There! >> [ Phone rings ] [ Rings ] >> [ Dogs barking ] >> [ Rings ] >> Shelter. Black lab retriever, answers to the name boots. I'll take a look. Nope, not here. [ Hangs up phone ] >> Please, warden, we want some more kibbles, sir. You'll eat this slop and like it! You're in my prison now! [ Laughs ] >> [ Sighs ] Okay, let's get to work. And watch the door! Number 7773294. Orange striped, long haired-- >> orange? Not in my family. Next. Hey, hey, wake up! Number 7773295. Dark upper back, white stomach, four white paws, black Crescent over right eye. Aw, what am I saying, it's a kitten. >> Wait... It's my older brother. Give me that! What am I doing? I can't read. >> He got placed. Wow, in barbizon estates! That's the rich part of town! >> Oh, wow, yeah, that's hairball, all right. Aw. He was always first in line at the feeding dish. >> [ Door opens ] >> [ Gasps ] >> Come on quick! In here! >> Okay, boys! Line up for flea baths! And keep your hands where I can see 'em! >> I can't see a thing, where's the stupid light switch? And let go of the files, I've got them. Whiskers, let go of the files. >> What are you talking about? I don't have your stupid files. >> Aah! >> [ Barks ] >> Aah! Give me those files! >> Don't move. Don't move. I'll try to distract him. Hey, mutt! Look at me so I can see. Huh, come on! No, no, no, I got a better idea. You give US the files and I'll, uh... I'll tell you a big secret. >> [ Growling ] >> Smell this. [ Exhales ] >> [ Sniffs ] >> I'm a cat. >> [ Barks ] >> Oh, no! He ate the files! [ Screams ] >> You'll swing for this, boys! [ Screams ] Oh, no! >> Come on! >> Oh! [ Screams ] >> [ Grunts ] Drop it! Come on! >> Whoa! [ Crash ] [ Screams ] >> [ Barking ] >> That guy back there was crazy. I was scared he was gonna catch US! >> You kidding? Catch me? Never. I would have leapt... Right over him. >> Whiskers, did it take you a real long time to... To learn how to leap? >> Me? You kidding? I... I was worse than you. >> Nice of you to come home, jed Samuel Martin. >> What happened to my office? And close that door. >> Hi! Nice time for a walk. Live around here? >> Yeah, nearby. >> Ah. >> Ooh, hi, Sonny. Nice lookin' kid. >> [ Chuckles ] >> Nice cans. >> Thanks. Say, do you have any kids around jed's age? >> Oh, no, no kids. Too much trouble. You know, "oh, clean your room! You clean your room! How many times have I told you to clean your room?" >> You know, you look familiar. Um, where'd you go to college? >> Oxford. >> No kidding? >> Dad, didn't you wanna punish me? >> [ Chuckles ] Kids. >> "Clean your room! Clean your room! How many times have I told you to clean your room?!" >> It was really nice meeting you. All right, good-bye. Come on, son. Come on. >> Nice guy. Bit odd. >> Hal... >> [ Clears throat ] Now listen here, young man, you and your cat... Go on. We'll talk tomorrow. >> A big talk. >> [ Grunts ] Hey, what's the matter? Whiskers? >> It's happening. I'm turning back into a cat. >> But you don't look like a cat. >> Oh, it's instinct. Trust me. >> Well, then we've gotta find your mom. Once you turn back into a cat, and my parents find you, well... >> Wow, your brother lives here? >> Yeah, I guess so. Wow, it looks like hairball really moved up in the world. >> [ Door shuts ] >> [ Meows ] >> Is it him? >> Yeah, yeah, it's him, all right. But he's gotten so... Big. >> [ Yowls ] >> Hey! [ Knocks ] Hey, hairball! Hey, it's me, your brother! >> Whiskers! >> Let US in! >> [ Meows ] >> [ Beeps ] >> You have really done well for yourself. I mean, look at this place! Ah, eh, and you know, I really like the weight. It--it, you know, it works on you. It really does. >> [ Meows ] >> Hey. >> [ Hisses ] >> Oh! What? Who am I? Hey, hairball, it's me, your baby brother! Huh? >> Come on, ask him about your mom. >> I am catching up, okay? I'm catching up. Well, so, have you heard from the rest of the litter? >> [ Meows ] >> What do you mean, you don't care? He doesn't care! Hey, you must know where mom is, right? But he loved mom. He was always her favorite. Hey, hey, don't do that. She's old now, she needs US! >> Come on, let's get out of here. >> [ Hisses ] >> Oh, well-- >> come on! Whiskers, let's go! >> You know, hairball... >> Forget about him! >> I used to admire you. >> Come on! >> [ Meows ] >> Wait a minute. > What? >> He says he's got something to show US. [ Sighs ] >> [ Meows ] >> Alexandrian breeding society? Your mom was a purebred? >> You better be telling the truth. You better! >> Whiskers, let's go. >> You know, I hope you're old someday with no one to take care of you! And just one more thing-- I lied to you about the weight. You look like a pig with hair! >> [ Yowls ] >> Good-bye! >> [ Yowls ] >> [ Alarm sounds ] >> He called the cops! >> You... Are no longer a cat! >> Come on! [ Screams ] >> [ Yowls ] >> [ Both screaming ] >> Welcome to the alexandrian breeding society. What might I do for you gentlemen? >> Uh, hi. My colleague here is-- is a top breeder, and he'd like to look at some cats. By the way, money is no object. >> I see. Perhaps you have, uh, something specific in mind? Let me see, um, yes. "Striped cat, white upper breast and white paws. Female. Beautiful. [ Clears throat ] Smelled good." Yes, well... "Paws, soft, gentle, loved birds..." >> Mmm. >> "Big birds..." >> Mm-hmm. >> "Small birds..." >> Mm-hmm. >> And she was brought here three years ago from animal shelter number 727. >> Ah. >> Hmm. >> And you'd wish to make a reservation for the new litter? >> I was in the last litter. >> Mr. Mobley, can I see you... In private for a sec? See my friend here, he's a little stressed. He's... Out on a day pass. >> Now I understand. He thinks he's a cat, doesn't he? >> Well, yeah, see, it's kinda sad 'cause he lost his cat three years ago and he went whacko! Sometimes he does really weird stuff, like he eats sardines right off the floor. >> No... >> Yeah. >> Ooh, that's tragic. >> Yeah, so, uh, can you help US? >> I'll be right back. >> Behave yourself! We lucked out. He thinks you're crazy. >> Here we are. I knew it. On an inspiration, I looked in the reject file. Is this the cat in question? >> [ Gasps ] Mom! [ Chuckles ] Wait a minute... What do you mean by reject? >> Well, it means her breed was not pure, you see. So we had to-- >> not pure? What do you mean, my-- my mom's no good? >> No, no, no, no, you see, her mother, or her grandmother... Made it with an alley cat. So, we had to-- >> now, what have you done with her? You--you vulture! >> I believe your friend's day pass is over! >> Just tell him what you did with her! >> I sent her to this nice old lady. We send them all there. >> The address! >> 1640 grand Avenue. >> Let's go! >> Wait a minute, wait a minute. The old lady, she's... >> She's dead. >> When? >> A few short months ago. They came and cleaned out the place-- the drapes, the carpets, the furniture... And the cats. >> Well, what happened to them, the cats? >> I don't know. One day, they were here... The next, they were gone. I'm sorry. >> Let's go home, whiskers. >> [ Purring ] [ Purring continues ] >> [ Meows ] >> [ Yawns ] What are you doing? >> I'm getting out of here. >> Why? >> Well, come this time tomorrow, I'm gonna be a cat again and I wanna be far away from this place when that happens. >> But--but I thought... >> Your mom and dad were gonna send me back to the shelter. So, uh... You know what happens to cats at the shelter? >> Well, yeah, sure. I mean, some other family is gonna-- >> take me home? No. No, they want kittens. Two weeks, and then they take you out back and... >> Out back? >> Oh, you don't get it, do you? Well, they kill you, jed. Oh, well, they do it nicely, but they kill you and... I'll... I'll take my chances on the street. >> But--but what about your mom? >> Oh, well, you-- you know, you gave it a good try. Ah, so, um, thanks. >> So you're just gonna give up? >> Yeah, well, you know, sometimes it's smarter to give up. >> Well, I think it's smarter to keep on trying. >> I'm out of here. >> Fine. I'll look for her myself. Let's go! >> [ Siren wailing in distance ] >> [ Sniffs ] She was here. [ Sniffs ] Yes, she was here. I can smell her scent. No, no, I've lost her. >> We had to try. >> That's what you're always saying. "We have to try, we have to try." Being human is... So... Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! >> Stupid? And since when are you such a genius? Who said his mother was going to Oxford? >> Well, that's what she said! >> Oh, yeah, right! Who ever heard of a cat going to Oxford?! I mean, Oxford?! >> Orford. She sent the cats to orford. >> What's in orford? >> Oh, it's lovely there. A nice man runs it... Just for cats, and he's never turned a cat away. Every cat knows about orford. [ Chuckles ] Well, have to make sure the house is empty. Tomorrow, they're tearing it all down. Mortals... >> What'd she say? >> Wow, look! >> [ Purring ] >> Whoa! >> Bastet! >> Jed, are you in bed yet? >> Oh. >> Night, sweetie. >> Good night, mom. Hurry up! >> [ Rings bell ] Ooh! >> Shh! What are you doing? >> What? >> Pedal! >> How do you pedal? >> How do you pedal? With your feet! Do you have to do that? >> It's fun! >> [ Panting ] [ Continues panting ] >> Well, look who's here. >> Hey, cat boy, you owe US some money. >> Yeah! Look at the big goof in the football helmet. >> Hey, who are you callin' a goof? [ Whispers ] What's a goof? >> So what do we do now? >> We act like cats. [ Hissing ] [ Roars ] >> Oh, I'm scared. Eh, crewcut? >> Oh, yeah. >> So, uh, now you guys owe US two bucks a piece, 'cause, uh, we're so scared, right, crewcut? >> Oh, yeah. Say your prayers, kitty litter! >> [ Hisses ] [ Screams ] [ Chuckles ] [ Roaring ] Go! >> Get the bikes! >> [ Dog barks ] >> Faster! Come on! >> Okay. >> Go in there! >> [ Screams ] Go! Go! Stop! [ Panting ] >> [ Grunts ] >> Hey! What'd you do that for? >> You ready? >> No, i--i can't. >> I'll go first. Just remember what I told you... See yourself here. >> We're here, cat boy! >> Come on, jed! Leap! >> I'm leaping! [ Grunts ] >> Yes! You did it, jed! >> Cat boy did it. >> All right, you go first. >> Are you nuts? You go first. >> Okay, we'll both go together. >> [ Both scream ] >> Jed: Nice jump! >> Who's the goof now? Huh? [ Chuckles ] Look at me! I'm dancin'! >> Whiskers, do you have to do that? >> Look at me, I'm dancin'! We're dancin'! >> Whoa! >> [ Groans ] >> Whiskers, don't be such a baby! >> Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! >> Hey, I see a sign! >> What? It says orford! >> Hey, we made it! >> [ Humming ] >> [ Panting ] >> [ Continues humming ] Aah! [ Grunting ] >> What's coming? >> What? >> What's coming? >> [ Both screaming ] [ Both groaning ] >> Oh, boy. Oh, boy. I must be dead. And this must be cat heaven. >> Then where am I? >> [ Meowing ] >> Whiskers, look! >> Wow! >> We made it! >> [ Meowing ] >> Do you see your mom? >> That's my mom. >> Aw. >> [ Meows ] >> Hey. >> [ Meows ] >> That's my little sister. >> [ Meows ] >> You have a sister? Cool! >> Oh, boy. Boy, that bastet really is something. It's like she planned it. >> And watched over US until we made it. Whiskers, where're you going? What's wrong? >> Jed... Tha... >> Both: Thanks. >> Thanks for teaching me how to leap. >> Oh, thanks for teaching me about friendship. But you know... One thing about friendship... >> Sometimes, friends have to say good-bye? But I wanna stay with you. >> But you're a kid... And I'm a cat. And there's a reason we're made the way we are. Oh, you'll have friends, believe me-- human friends, lots of 'em. >> But you'll always be my best friend, whiskers. >> And you'll be mine... For life. >> [ Meows ] >> Bye, whiskers. >> [ Meows ] [ Meows ] [ Meows ] >> Jed, time to get up. Jed? Jenny! [ Panting ] Jenny, his bicycle's gone! >> Oh, my god, hal! What if... >> [ Phone rings ] >> Hello? Jed? Are you okay? Orford? Honey... Are you okay? >> He's gone now. >> Who's gone? >> Who do you think? Whiskers. >> Whiskers? Why? >> 'Cause you were gonna take him away, 'cause you thought I was no good at making friends and... And now you don't have to worry, 'cause he's gone, okay? >> Jed, we'd never send whiskers away. >> You're lying! I heard you talking about the vet! You were gonna-- >> take him in for a checkup. 'Cause, uh... Well, soon... >> You're gonna have a little sister. >> You're pregnant? >> We, uh, wanted to break the news to you gently, but I guess we blew that, huh? Jed, you're amazing. How did you find this place? >> It's a long story, dad. >> Let's go get whiskers. >> No. Whiskers is staying. >> But I thought he was your best friend? >> Jenny: Jed, are you sure? >> Whiskers belongs here with his family. >> Breakfast! Come and get it, breakfast! Come on! Here, kitty, come on! Breakfast! >> What? >> [ Meows ] >> [ Chuckles ] >> [ Purrs ] [ Meows ] >> For life, whiskers. >> [ Meows ] >> A little sister... Cool. >> [ Chuckles ] >> [ Roars ] >> [ Indistinct chatter ] >> Sure you don't want me to come in? >> Whiskers: A cat... Is master of every situation. >> No, thanks. >> [ Sighs ] >> Whiskers: A cat is brave even when he doesn't feel brave. A cat walks in, looks everyone straight in the eye... And makes the place his own. >> You the new kid? >> Yeah. I'm the new kid. >> I'm Mel. Melanie. >> Jed. >> [ Bell rings ] >> Girl: Look, they're walking together. >> [ Bell rings ] >> [ Indistinct chatter ] >> Adult jed: Ten years in the life of boy can seem like a long time... But ten years in the life of a cat... Is almost a lifetime. I'd seen whiskers many times over the years-- when his morn died and when his sister had eight kittens in one litter-- but this time I had something to tell him I just knew he was gonna like. Hey, whiskers... How you been? >> [ Meows ] >> I got some news for you. Guess where I'm going, huh? Guess. I'm going to Oxford, whiskers. I'm going to england. I got a scholarship and they're sending me to Oxford! I owe it all to you. You know that, don't you? Huh? You remember? Everything we did that summer? You remember it, don't you? Eh? You rest now.
