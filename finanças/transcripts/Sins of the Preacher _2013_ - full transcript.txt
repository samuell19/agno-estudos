Heavenly Father, we thank you for so many things. We thank you for this beautiful day. We thank you for this food before us, and may those who eat it be blessed. We thank you for family, and the ties that bind us. And the love that flows between us. We thank you for your strength. Your mercy. Your sacrifice. Your understanding when we falter and your forgiveness when we fall. We ask that you watch over us and keep us from harm. We pray that you stand with us when we cause harm to others, and forgive us of our sins. And in your son's name we pray. Amen. - Amen. Hello? This is she. What? No, no, no, no! - What is it? Everything OK? - My Debbie. OK, I gotta go. There's somebody at the front door. It's the ambulance, OK? Top of the stairs, to the right. Top of the stairs. Aw, Jesus. Come on, guys, get her. Check on her. Open bottle of pills on the nightstand. Trying to resuscitate her right now. - Start compressions. - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. We have a note on the corner. Debbie asked me to go pick up a video and fill up her SUV for the week. I was gone about 45 minutes or so. And when I got back, the bedroom door was locked. Debbie, why is this door locked? Debbie! Debbie! Debbie! - I used a screwdriver to get in... - Debbie! - ...and then I found her. She was on the bed, naked. - Debbie! She wasn't breathing. Then I saw the note on the night stand. Debbie! Debbie is... - ...was taking these sleeping pills every night. - Debbie. Did she ever show signs of depression? She's been struggling ever since our daughter, Natalie, died. That was four years ago. So, yes, I guess you could say that she was depressed. And she sometimes talked about... She... This past week Debbie talked about taking her own life. Thank you very much, sir. Debbie! Where is my daughter?! Deb... Debbie! What happened?! I'm really, but we did everything we could. She overdosed on sleeping medication and suffered a cardiac arrest. What? So she had a heart attack? It appears to be a suicide. I'm very sorry. Please. Susan, Susan, don't go up there. You don't want to see her like this. OK? How is this possible? I just talked to her this afternoon. I know. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry you lost your little girl. The girls. Where are the girls? In their room. They somehow slept through all of this. Debbie... Susan, God. She's gone. Our baby is gone. Where are the girls? They're in their room asleep. I ought to wake them. No. - I can't believe... Grandma? Why are you here? Girls. Come, give me a hug. Where's Mommy? I wish there was something I could say to make it better. I just wanna sleep. I lie in bed and try to understand. Why didn't Debbie talk to me? You can't blame yourself for this. Who can I blame? Who? The past three days have been really rough making the funeral plans. Frankly, I don't know how your sister's done it all. Well, I've had no choice. Andrew's been in such a hurry. Girls, you wanna stand up straight, please? Thank you. Andrew. - I'm so sorry for your loss, Andrew. - Thank you, Kathy. I appreciate that. OK, girls, you wanna give Aunt Kathy a hug and then go grab our seats, OK? This is a devastating shock for all of us. Most of all you. If you need any help with anything, getting things in order or the girls, anything, I... Thank you, Kathy. But I think we just need to keep moving forward. I'm gonna return to work at the church tomorrow. Really? Are you sure you don't want to take some time off? I mean, I'm sure your congregation would understand. The Lord was with me when I came back to the church after Natalie died. I'm just gonna do the same this time. He'll give me the strength to carry on. I think it's what Debbie would want me to do, too. - Rob. - Andrew. Mary. You OK? It is with heavy hearts that we gather today to remember the life of Debbie Martin. In these times of unanswerable questions, we look to the Lord for hope and forgiveness, and we remember his promise of life everlasting. This was Debbie's. I used it in the service and I think you should have it. Andrew didn't want it? No. - Thank you, pastor. For everything. God bless. "With all my heart and soul, I love you. I want you to use this to grow closer to the Lord, and also to learn more about him. I hope that we will forever be rooted together through the words of this God-breathed masterpiece. I love you. Andrew." Everyone at work has been so understanding. But I feel like I can't trust myself. I'll be going along just fine and then it'll just hit me and I'll burst into tears. Give it time. It's only been a couple weeks. I know. It's just that now that the shock has worn off, I... I just miss her so much. Have you heard from Andrew? I've called over a few times to talk to the girls, but they were busy. - Has he ordered a headstone yet? - No, not yet. But I offered my help and he said he'd take care of it. Susan, did you ever talk to the police? The police? About what? About why there wasn't an autopsy? Tom talked to them, the... ...the night of her death. They said that Judge Carter had already ruled - that it wasn't necessary. - Why not? Because... it was a suicide. Well, you see, that's what we were wondering about. Aunt Susan, we don't believe Debbie killed herself. What are you talking about? The police said... - Yeah, we know what the police said. It doesn't make any sense. Debbie was a happy person. She had her friends, she was excited about her new job at the school, and, most of all, she had her girls. I know it's... - ...it's hard to believe. - It's not just that. - There's are things that don't add up. - What things? All those pills. Debbie didn't take pills like that. - We don't know that. - And they found her naked? That's not the Debbie that we know. She was way too modest for that. She was in a desperate place. Then what about the suicide note? If you were really in that state of mind, would you take the time to type and print a note? She didn't even sign it. I don't understand, what are you saying? Susan, we think Debbie was murdered - and we think that Andrew is responsible. - No! No! You are wrong. He loved her and he would never do anything, anything to hurt her. - Susan, I'm not trying to upset you. - I can't believe this! - I cannot hear this! - Susan... Susan... You have never liked Andrew. You've made that very clear over the years. But that does not make him a murderer! - He is my son-in-law. - Susan, listen. You don't think it's strange that he went right back to work? That he didn't even cry at the funeral? That he won't let you see the girls? He is the father of my grandchildren! We would never say anything unless we really felt like we had to. Aunt Susan, Andrew is not a good man. He is a minister. He's a minister, he's a man of God, and he would never... For God's sake, be honest with yourself. You can't tell me you never had doubts. I mean, even before they were married, didn't you think there was always something wrong? I appreciate both of you coming... ...but this conversation is just making things worse. Aunt Susan! Andrew and those girls are the only connection I have left to Debbie. I want you... I want you to back off and I want you to drop it. Do you understand? Do you understand?! It's dropped. So we're just gonna drop it? Just like that? Absolutely not. - Did you see that? - What? So... -! - ...Mom? - Sweetheart... What do you think? You look beautiful. Did the seamstress get everything? - It's pulled in enough? - It's perfect. Really? You think so? You should be on the cover of magazine. Deb? This might not be the right time to say this, but... ...your father and I are worried. Everything's happening too fast. Mom, I told you we don't want to wait. Andrew wants to marry me right away. I know, but you're so young, and... - Well, you don't really know him. - Mom, stop, please. Where is his family? Where are Andrew's friends? Why is your cousin his best man instead of one of his friends? Mom, Andrew doesn't have any friends. That's why he needs me. What kind of man doesn't have friends? Mom, I love him. I know what I'm doing. He's a good Christian man. After what my family has been through, some people are surprised to see me here so soon. But I am still your pastor and I still have a job to do. I am here because God wants me here. Well, he seems to be holding it together pretty well. A little bit too well, don't you think? What do you mean? I mean he doesn't look like a man who just lost his wife. What does he look like? Happy. Happy. Hey, I didn't see you in there. Were you hiding? Nice to see you. Hi, Susan. How are you? I'd give you a hug, but I've got my hands kind of full here. That's all right. I just wanted to drop this off and see how you and the girls are. We're just fine. Just fine. You really don't need to come over and check up on us. I'm not checking up on you, Andrew. I want to see the girls. Are they home? They're at a friend's. - All right. I'll come back tomorrow. You know, right now they're so busy with school and homework. I haven't seen the girls in weeks, Andrew. OK, well, why don't we make some plans ahead of time? All right. What do you got there? - Are those pictures? - Thanks for coming by, Susan. I'll be sure to tell the girls you say hello. All right. Give Tom my love. Everything OK? Yeah, it's great. Just great. I went to see Andrew and the girls today. How are they? I didn't see 'em. Andrew said they weren't home, they went to a friend's. That's good. I mean, they should be with friends. Have some fun. Andrew met me out front. He was carrying a box. He was hiding it from me, what was inside. Well, did you ask him about it? He basically ran away from me. There was a moment when the box top slid open, and I swear, Tom, there were pictures of Debbie inside of it. And he was throwing it in the trash. The trash! Suze, there's gotta be an explanation. I don't know. There is something wrong about the whole thing. People grieve differently. Maybe it was just too painful for him to have those photos around. No, there's something else going on here. I can't stop thinking about what... ...Laura and Kathy said about the note. Suze. We already talked about this. Tom, there are so many unanswered questions and Andrew is acting so strangely, I just... I think... I think we should do something. Nothing we do is going to bring her back. I need to know, Tom. I need to know if Debbie took her life. Or if someone took it from her. So what do we do? We start asking questions. I talked to Chief Richards and... ...he seemed like he didn't want to have anything to do with me. - And? - And he said it was an open case and I should bring him any information I was could find. So they're not gonna do anything about it. No. Did you know that Debbie was seeing a social worker - for counseling? - Yes. She saw somebody after Natalie died, but that was four years now. Well, looks like she went back. Right around the same time she told me she thought Andrew was cheating on her. She told you that? Why didn't she tell us? She didn't want to worry you. She wanted to make her marriage work more than anything. - But there are things about Andrew... - What things? Laura? Did something happen? It wasn't that big of a deal. Back then it was just weird. You need to tell us. Please. Hey, sweetie, I'll take that. - Hi, Laura, how nice to see you. - Hello, Andrew. Laura brought a casserole, just needs to be heated up. So, what do you think? - Um... ...three-fifty for about 20 minutes should do it. - Laura, you OK? - I'm fine. You sure? - OK, why don't you start on that? I can't even remember how many times he did it. It was so vulgar and juvenile... That's unbelievable. Why didn't you tell us? What could I say? It was so strange. To say the least. - Did you tell Debbie? No, I was going to, but... after Natalie died I... I didn't have the heart to make things worse. I'm sorry. - Sweetheart. It's OK. - It's OK. - So many weird things happened the night Debbie died. Like, I overheard Andrew tell the police that Debbie took Xanax. That's a total lie. And that she wanted to be cremated. - What?! - I know. I butted in and he backed right off. And when I talked to poison control the next day... ...they told me that a death from an overdose of her sleeping pills would take a long time. A lot longer than 45 minutes. Which is how long Andrew said he was out. How do we convince them to investigate this? We do exactly what they told us to do. We build the case ourselves. No, that can't be. This is my daughter's number and she's no longer with us. OK, thank you. And thank you again for all your help today. Unbelievable. When Debbie and Andrew moved back to town, she asked if they could put their cell phones on our plan to save on the deposit, and get better rates. Every month the bill would come, she'd give me a check, - I wouldn't think about it. - Right. On this last statement... ...Andrew has made almost 200 calls to Debbie's phone. - Two hundred? - Yes. And last week, he made 17 phone calls in one day. - Since the funeral? - Yes. - So, he took Debbie's phone... - And gave it to someone else two days after she died. You should keep that account the way it is so we can see what he's doing. How's the stakeout going? Well, he's been seen with a woman, named Brianna Daniels, at church and after work. Supposedly he's counseling her. Counseling her about what? She's a recent divorcee. A very attractive divorcee. When did he start meeting with her? Three months before Debbie died. Kristy, here comes your dad. Happy birthday, darlin'. Good afternoon, everyone. - Good afternoon! Hi Reverend Martin, the girls are really excited. Show some enthusiasm, girls. - Yeah! Who's ready for a birthday party? - Me! Why don't we all pile in the limo? Baby, I've got another surprise for you too. You remember that special lady I was telling you about? - Yeah. - Well, Kristy, this is Brianna, our new friend. She's going to spend the day with us. - Hi. Hi, beautiful. Happy birthday. Thank you. - Yeah. Ready for a limo ride? Kristy! Kristy! - Susan. - Andrew! We had plans to go shopping for Kristy's birthday. Perhaps another time. We've already made plans, Susan. Did you give that woman Debbie's cell phone? - Good bye, Susan. God bless. - Did you? Andrew, you can't keep my granddaughter from me! That is appalling. What nerve, doing that in front of Kristy. You should've heard what the teachers are saying. Well, you should hear what people in town are calling us. - What? - Charlie's Angels. You're kidding. - Like the TV show? - Yep. Three hot investigators. - And guess who's Charlie? - Tom. Well, I guess that would make sense. But no, it's you! Stop. Hello? Um, yes, Mary, thank you for calling. We've been trying to reach you. I can be there in an hour. I'm so sorry to finally be meeting you under these circumstances. I was very fond of Debbie. Thank you. I was wondering if you could tell me why she was here. If you can. I'm not bound by any doctor/patient confidentiality. I'm a grief counselor, not a therapist. So... um... In all the times I met with Debbie... ...she never mentioned suicide. Not once. She was very upset about Natalie's death, as any mother would be. She would talk about how she missed her, but she was not depressed. What about Andrew? Did she talk about their relationship? That's another story. Um... Her marriage was troubled. In our last session... Honestly, it haunts me that I couldn't help her. She was so upset about Andrew. And she was convinced he was having an affair. What makes you say that? He's changed. He's never home, and when he is there, he's not really. I don't know, I don't know how to explain it. It's just different. Have you tried to talk to him about it? No, and if I did, he'd only dodge it, and say that I was crazy and twist my words. So what do you plan to do about it? I don't know. I love him, but... But what? Yesterday, we had this really big fight. And he got so angry at me. And then, after he left, I started snooping through his briefcase and I found this bottle of crushed pills. Debbie, what is it? - I'm just so afraid. - Afraid of what? Afraid that my husband's trying to kill me. So... that's the last time I saw her. I'm so very sorry. If there's anything you need me to do, if there's any way that I can help, I'm here. Thank you. So, Laura's realtor friend showed Andrew a new house in the Allendale Development yesterday. - She said that he was very excited, and that he had just come into some money. And I checked into the phone calls he's been making, and I tracked down some of the numbers, including five jewelry stores. Jewelry stores for what? Hello? Of course. He's buying an engagement ring. Yeah. Where is he getting all of this money? Debbie's retirement fund. What?! That's her money! That should go to the girls! Sorry I'm late. I just got off the phone with the 911 dispatcher who took Andrew's call that night. She emailed me the full transcripts. So what did she say? - She talked him through performing CPR on Debbie. And he gave her a play by play of what he was doing. - So? - Sorry, Aunt Susan, this is kind of graphic. - It's OK. The 911 dispatcher says, "Tell me exactly what happened." Then Andrew says, "Her lips are blue. Her hands are, are, are cold, and there's a note that says, 'I'm sorry' basically. She's not breathing at all. No pulse or anything." 911 says, "OK, I need you to get her on her back, flat on the ground. Do this and tell me when you're done." Andrew says, "I know how to do CPR, I'm certified to do it." The dispatcher tells him to check inside her mouth, then he says... "There is fluid in her nose and mouth, it just poured out of her onto the floor." It goes on like that. But listen to this. The 911 dispatcher says, "Can you lean in and check for breathing?" Nothing. There's nothing. OK. I'll let you know when the ambulance arrives. Now, we're going to start compressions. Let her chest come up all the way between pumps. I know, I know, OK. There's something coming out of her mouth again. - Don't stop the compressions. - OK, I gotta go. There's somebody at the front door. It's the ambulance. OK? Top of the stairs, to the right. And then he hangs up. What? But here's the weirdest thing. The ambulance didn't use a siren that night. And when the EMTs arrived, they didn't have to pound on the door or ring the bell. Why? Andrew was standing outside, waiting for them the whole time. He wasn't with Debbie performing CPR in the bedroom. He didn't try to save her. He acted out the whole thing. For four minutes and 28 seconds. - What? He made up every gory detail. My God. Susan... In the months leading up to her death, Debbie Martin was often anxiety-ridden about her marriage, and she was concerned about her husband's behavior. - How? - Well, she told me Andrew was becoming increasingly distant, you know, cold. She felt like their marriage was falling apart. It's not a crime for a man to leave his wife, Ms. Stone. It is if, as Debbie believed, he planned to kill her in the process. Wait. Wait. You can't just walk in here and tell me that Debbie thought the reverend had a plot to murder her. It's all there in the file. Debbie found ground-up pills in Andrew's briefcase. There are also phone records here that show that Andrew was calling Brianna Daniels months before Debbie passed. The same Brianna Daniels that he is now dating. There's your motive. I'm sure this is all very emotional for you, ma'am, but none of this is strong enough evidence for us to bring any charges against Reverend Martin. My daughter died less than a month ago. Don't you think it's a little soon to be dating? They've already been questioned. The reverend and Brianna. They have? Brianna denied any sort of relationship. She said that he was a "family friend." And there was nothing in Andrew's statement to indicate foul play. If you thought it was a suicide, why did you question them? Chief, please, just look at the evidence. There are too many things here that don't make sense. An overdose from Unisom is a slow death. Look, it never all adds up. There are always conflicting details in suicide cases. You got that right. There's nothing here that would lead any judge to change the cause of Debbie's death from a suicide. We need to access Andrew's computer records. I am sure there's something there. Can't you at least check into that? Look, this isn't up to me. If you want anything done on this case, you need to convince Judge Carter to change his ruling on the death certificate. And let me spare you a lot of time and aggravation there, Carter doesn't change his rulings, ever. That's about to change. I'm sorry, Susan. I feel like I let you down in there. You didn't. Thank you for coming, by the way. This is just the beginning. You heard him, I have to get the judge to change the death certificate. Are you sure you want to do that? Of course I am. I need to do this for Debbie. But to change the cause of death they'll have to exhume her body and do an autopsy. Are you sure you wanna put yourself through that? After everything? This is my little girl. How can I rest until I know the truth? Mr. and Mrs. Parker, Wade Thompson. - How are you? - Hi. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Well, first, let me express my sincere condolences. I can't imagine what it might be like to lose a daughter, especially under such dreadful circumstances. Thank you. But I have to tell you, this case... ...the incompetence... ...quite honestly, it makes me angry. Now, I understand you want to officially change your daughter's cause of death. Yes. Now, this is a good start, but in order to exhume the body and do an autopsy, we'll need more. We need to investigate Andrew. Really look into his past. - OK. - But you should know, once we dive in, there'll be no turning back. This will be a traumatic process and could take months. And it still might not tell us anything in the end. No, we understand the risks. Now, you're OK with removing the girls, um... Heather and Kristy. ...Heather and Kristy, from Andrew's custody, permanently? What are the alternative? Leaving them with that monster? So... you will take the case? Not only that. I'll do my best to win. This whole stakeout business is making me so hungry. Shh, something's happening, Mom. Is it Brianna? - Yeah, it's definitely her. Can you see what he's saying? No. But Andrew clearly doesn't want to deal with whatever it is. Nice car, by the way. Is it Brianna's? I don't think so. Hey, Susan! Am I catching you at a bad time? No, no. Did you find something? Possibly. There's a police report from a while back that implicates Andrew on a charge of sexual assault. Before he met Debbie? Right around the same time. I was able to track down the woman that filed charges. - I'm actually on my way to see her... - I'm coming with you. Of course you are. Why do you think I stopped by? Andrew and I got jobs at the "Y" around the same time. I didn't really pay much attention to him at first. I just wanted to do my job. So, he didn't initially make a pass at you? Or show any signs of sexual aggression? Not until the day he followed me into the women's bathroom. Hey, Casey. - Hey. - How you doing? - I'm good. - Yeah? - Just finishing up. Just thought I'd come and give you a hand. That's OK, you don't have to. Are you ticklish? Little bit? - No. Are you OK, Casey? Just take your time. Sorry, I just haven't talked about it in such a long time. He started jabbing at me - with the mop. - Yeah, don't. At first it was my arms, my back. But then it was... ...between my legs. Don't! Sorry, you don't like that? Was anyone else around? No, there was no one. I told him to stop... ...but he kept jabbing at me... ...and laughing. Quit. It's OK. No. I'm sure, I'm sure. No! - He kept trying to kiss me. He forced my legs open... ...and pressed himself against me. Stop it! Stop it! No! - Feel that? And then... ...he held my hands behind my back... ...and he... Well, he touched me. No! Stop! Stop it! What? And then he just stopped. Why? I don't know. He suddenly released me and then walked out of the room like it never happened. I just started cleaning again. I think I was in shock. I am so sorry for your loss, Mrs. Parker. I wish I could have done something to help your daughter. Thank you. I hope he rots in hell for what he's done. You OK? Look what he did to that poor girl and he doesn't even know her. It makes me crazy to think about Debbie and what he put her through. I warned you this would be difficult. I'm... I'm starting to accept all of that about Andrew. How awful he was, how awful he is. But what I don't understand is... ...why Debbie would cover for him this whole time. I mean, surely she saw it too? Why did she stay with him? Why didn't she leave him? He was the father of her children. Maybe she was scared of him. We're gonna make him pay, Susan. We better. "Wives, submit to your own husbands as to the Lord." "For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the Church." "Now as the Church submits to Christ..." "So also wives should submit in everything to their husbands." "So also wives... ...should submit in everything to their husbands." This is a tradition that Debbie, your mom, started a year after Natalie died. So every year, on Mother's Day, your mom would light a candle for your sister. And this year, I added a candle to honor your mom. Would you like to light the candles? - What's wrong? - I don't want to. Why don't you want to light the candles? Because I'm mad at you. Why are you mad at me, sweetheart? Because you were mean to my daddy. I have not been mean to your father, Kristy. Yes you have. You sent him bad emails. Kristy, emails are private between adults. What did your dad tell you? He didn't like the questions you were asking about Brianna. OK. I don't want to upset you. I know you love your dad. Daddy says that you won't move on. Darling girl... I miss your mom so much. I will never forget her. And I hope you don't, either. Grandma? - Can I still light the candles? Hello, everyone. Sorry I'm late. - Deacon. - Andrew. - Ralph. - Have a seat. First off, just wanted to let you know that our hearts and our prayers went out to both you and the girls when we learned of Debbie' passing. Everybody has been wonderfully supportive. That being said, um... ...just gonna cut to the chase. A few of us in the congregation are... uncomfortable with your affections towards Ms. Daniels. And you've been missing church meetings lately to be with her. Well, with all due respect, why is it anyone's business who I spend my time with? Because we need a devoted reverend here, Andrew. The parish relies on you, and they need to know they can count on you. And you have to see how this looks to the outside, so soon after your wife's passing. Wait, why does any of this...? She is just a friend. OK? That's all. Well, it just doesn't feel, or appear, to be the behavior of a good Christian man. So, what now? We think it would be best if we parted ways. We'll keep this clean and simple. We're gonna need your files back, as well as your computer. And in exchange, I'll help you find a position somewhere else. That's gonna be a problem. - Why is that? My computer was stolen. Well, why wasn't this reported? You know what? I don't have to report to you or anyone else in this room. I only need to report to God. What are you doing here? We had lunch plans. I thought I'd just meet you here. - Let's go. - Andrew, what's wrong? - I just quit. - What? Why? It's for the best. There's too much negativity and gossip here. I mean, there are people following and investigating me. Andrew, who would investigate you? I think I know exactly who. And she is not gonna get away with it. Hello? Andrew? Susan. Why are you calling so late? Are the girls OK? I just wanted to ask you a question. - What? - Why are you doing all this? - All of what? - Spreading rumors, raising suspicions. You know, just causing trouble. You know why. You know, I don't appreciate you interrogating my daughter. She said you hurt her arm. Andrew, all I did was speak with her. You do wanna see the girls again, right, Susan? What are you talking about? Well, you know, all this mess you're causing is making the girls very upset. And now they don't even want to see you or Tom. I will not let you take those children away from me. I'm your son, Susan. Why would you wanna poison my reputation? You are no son of mine. You may be the father of my grandchildren, but that is the only connection to me that I will grant you. Do you understand? Do you? We know you did it. We know you killed Debbie. Susan, you know... Did you hear me, Andrew? We know you did it! Chief, it's Susan Parker. I dropped a new file of evidence at your office. I am still trying to access Andrew's computer records. We have requested his Internet files from the church, but we haven't received them yet. I hope you had a chance to look at the file. Please call me back at your earliest convenience. Please, Chief Richards, please return my call. We have the coffee. This is the third message I have left for the chief this week. How can I get a permit to exhume her body if no one will call me back? Well, maybe this will make you feel better. Get this, the timeline doesn't make sense. We drove it last night. - Andrew said he left his house at 11:15 to gas up the SUV and rent a video. So, we left Debbie's house at 11:15. We took the road under the highway just like Andrew said he did. The whole trip took only 35 minutes. - Andrew said he was out for 45 minutes. And do you remember when the EMTs said that there was lividity in Debbie's body? Blood that pools after death? Well, that would take at least two or three hours to happen. Which would make it impossible for Debbie to have died within the 35 minutes Andrew was out. So what do we do with all of this evidence if no one will even listen? Where did you get this? There was a woman in town handing them out in a parking lot. Who was she? Just someone who's following the case from the news. She's a mother, too, and she wanted to help get the word out. People believe us, Aunt Susan. And they want to help. Hey, Tom. Get Susan. I don't know what she did, but it worked! The police chief OK'd the exhumation! Susan! - Susan, you did it. The controversy surrounding the death of Debbie Martin continues to swirl.Reverend Martin is allegedly furious about the scheduled exhumation of his wife's body tomorrow. And this usually quiet town has been split into two camps. There are those aligned with the reverend who think that exhuming her body is a desecration of her spirit. There are many who are sympathetic to Susan Parker, and believe her daughter's death was due to foul play. We never expected a campaign of persecution against us. Now those same individuals seek to desecrate the spirit and soul of my beautiful Debbie. They want to remove her from her final resting place and pull her from the welcoming arms of the Lord. Now, this is enough to break your trust, your faith in those around you. But this will not break my trust in the Lord or my trust in all of you. Amen! Now, my daughters and I remain strong, and we remain certain that the truth will come out. - Amen! Either way, the coroner's report should shed some light on this ongoing debate. - It's me. - Where are you? I'm gonna go to my mom's, until things blow over. Andrew? You're just gonna leave me? After what I did for you? I'm sorry about everything. Brianna, where are you? I'm coming to find you. I can't do this anymore. God has forgiven me, Brianna. And he has forgiven you as well. An awful lot was lost in the embalming, Susan. I'm really sorry. So, it was all for nothing? Well, not completely. Um... The, um, tests reveal there were traces of a different sleep medication, Ambien, in Debbie's tissue. But there was no determination whether this killed her or not. Debbie didn't have a prescription for Ambien. I know. - Give me that. What is this? "An abrasion to the nose and discoloration around the mouth that might be consistent with suffocation?" There's nothing definitive. But what is it? What does it mean? Does it mean that he suffocated her? It may not mean anything. Yeah, but is it enough? Is it enough to do anything with? I'm not sure. It's a tremendous blow to her. She put everything she had left into this investigation. We can't give up on this. I know. We'll keep trying to find something. That's not enough! Look, Tom, I know how you feel... No, you don't! You have no idea how hard this is. You have no idea how I feel if you haven't been through it yourself! No idea at all! We can't give up on this. I have already lost my daughter to that devil! I refuse to lose my wife as well. I'm so sorry, baby. Go back to sleep. This isn't over. You know that. We just have to keep our faith. How can I have faith in a God that would take my Debbie away? Peace. Lord, grant me peace. Calm my soul. I feel like I have so much worry, I can't get a hold on it. Lord, I am asking you to protect me from harm. I am not sure what's going on with Andrew, but Lord, help me find peace with him. Gotcha. What's this? When the church asked Andrew to return his computer, he said it had been stolen. - So Susan and I were instantly suspicious. - How did you get it? She requested to see the files on the church's network, to look into Andrew's Internet activity. And you found these? - For a supposedly religious man, Andrew sure did have a penchant for pornography. Pretty graphic stuff, too. But here's what really got to me. In the weeks leading up to Debbie's death, Andrew searched for information on sleep medication. And he went to websites that could ship the drugs to his home without a doctor's prescription. - And your theory is? - That he was using his computer at work to figure out the best way to murder his wife... ...among other things. Are we ready to eat some crow here? This does not look good, Richards. Not good at all. Perhaps we were a little too quick to rule this a suicide? - With the information we had... - I know, I know. I'm just as much at fault as you are. Yes, sir. So, will you change the cause of death on the certificate to homicide? I won't go that far. But I will grant you that there is reasonable doubt as to the cause of Ms. Martin's death. "Undetermined." Thanks, Judge. That'll be enough. The amended certificate will be on your desk in the morning. Yes, sir. The DA will be waiting for it. Nolan. Don't let this happen again. No, sir. You are making a huge mistake. Why would I kill Debbie? I loved Debbie. I am a man of God! Do you understand me? I'm a man of God! "And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the word of Christ, the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither his mark upon their foreheads..." Judge Carter changed the death certificate. Cause of death is now undetermined. What? How? The computer files. You were right. It was enough. They arrested Andrew this morning. We're going to trial. God! Wade! Tom! Get down here! Wade stressed to me how thorough your research, your investigation was, Mrs. Parker. I went through it. What you and your angels gathered and, I have to tell you, - it was impressive. - Thank you. Can I get you both something to drink? No? Um, as you know, Reverend Martin is currently out on bail and he's taking as many interviews as he can. Certainly not helping us any. But I think... I think I have an angle to get us into court. We need a strong witness. Someone who's directly connected to the reverend and the case. That is not a problem. Wade and I have talked to dozens of people who would be willing to testify at a moment's notice. Yeah, but they're not strong enough. They're all too circumstantial. You have any other suggestions, George? Any other angles we haven't explored? Brianna Daniels. Brianna is our ticket. See, when Andrew was brought in for questioning, he claimed, under oath, that he did not have a relationship with Brianna Daniels. Clearly, that's BS. If we get her on the stand, I think we might have a shot. Ever since he's been out on bail, I haven't been able to sleep. I'm afraid. You know, I keep having these awful nightmares. You have to understand my position here. I could lose my job. Everyone's treating me like I'm some kind of leper. It's not easy. The position he's put you in, I understand. Listen, Brianna. We know that you were with Andrew for weeks before Debbie's death. We have all your phone records. We know that you went ring shopping. Do you deny that? - No. - OK. Then, you admit that you were in an intimate relationship with the Reverend - at the time of Debbie's death? - No! No, at that time... At that time, we were just friends. So... Did he ever mention anything to you about Debbie's death? Did you ever discuss it? After her funeral we didn't speak for a while. But, yes, we discussed it. In what context did you discuss it? His wife just died. It was hard not to discuss it. Well, maybe I'm not being specific enough. Let me be specific. Did Andrew ever admit any involvement in Debbie's death to you? Um... Ms. Daniels... ...we're prepared to offer you immunity if you testify. I don't know what you want me to say. Tell the truth. That's all we're asking. Just tell the truth. Now, if she says what I think she's gonna say, we could get a conviction on Andrew. Look, Brianna Daniels is far from an ideal witness. She's done nothing but lie about her relationship with him. Can we expect a jury to believe her? - They will. And I think she's got a lot more to say than she's letting on. How do we know that this isn't just some ploy by your office to get this case thrown out? This isn't a ploy, Wade, believe me. OK? You wanna go to trial? You gotta get Brianna Daniels on the stand to do that. Wade, please. This is it. This is our only chance. Let's give it a shot. Can I help, Aunt Susan? There are towels in the second drawer there. I'm so proud of you. For all that you've done for Debbie. Stop. And it's not just me, it's the whole community. And I know it's hard, but we're doing the right thing. Did you ever question that? No. I didn't. But I worried that you did. He's gonna pay, Laura. You'll see. He's gonna pay. Hello? Hello? Brianna? I'm... I'm so sorry. Brianna? Brianna?! Just tell me everything's gonna be all right. Everything's gonna be all right. Andrew Martin led a double life. A supposed man of God, he used his position as a minister for evil purposes. Andrew Martin killed his wife, the mother of his two daughters, and orchestrated a cover-up to make the death look like a suicide. Over the course of this trial, you'll learn about the improbability of Andrew Martin's timeline the night of Debbie's death. You'll hear his disturbing statements during the 911 call. We'll show you the incriminating material found on his work computer, the toxicology results from Debbie's autopsy... ...and then, finally, you'll hear from the woman who knew Andrew best. His mistress, Brianna Daniels, who will tell us the truth about the night in question. In The Merchant of Venice, Shakespeare reminds us that "Even the devil can cite Scripture for his purposes." That man, ladies and gentlemen, is the devil. And we're going to convince you of that. Debbie Martin suffered from anxiety and depression. In public, she wore a brave face. But in private, she was a wreck over the tragic loss of her child, Natalie. Now, we will not deny that the reverend was having a relationship with Brianna Daniels. A relationship that was purely platonic until weeks after Debbie's passing. The reverend is a deeply religious man, and his love for Brianna caused him incredible conflict. But the appropriate time frame for a widower to move on with his life is not what is on trial here today. Police officers on the scene the day of Debbie's death found no reason to determine that this was anything other than a suicide. Nothing. This case was not declared a murder investigation until the family realized that Andrew was moving on with his life. And this is why we are here, ladies and gentlemen. This is a last stab at revenge from a grieving mother who can not accept her daughter's death. But what we all have to understand is that Andrew Martin is a victim as well. An innocent man cannot be held responsible for a mother's grief. I am confident that you will help the reverend restore his good name. Debbie was so sweet. She was... She was an extrovert. She worked so hard to get her Master's degree. And she adored, just adored, her girls. She would do anything for them. And how was she after Natalie's death? If you are asking me if she grieved the death of her child, of course she did. Like any mother would. But Debbie had faith that she would see Natalie again in heaven. Isn't it a fact that Debbie routinely used sleeping medication? She sometimes had trouble sleeping, but it wasn't a problem. Would you describe the use as frequent? I don't know how often, but it didn't take over her life. So you deny that Debbie took a sleeping pill every single night? We have... phone records, that show Andrew calling Brianna. We can prove they were having an affair! Answer the question, Mrs. Parker. Yes, she... She took a sleeping pill every night, - but I don't know if... - Thank you, Mrs. Parker. You can step down, Mrs. Parker. I blew it. You did fine. - No, she... she ambushed me. And she twisted my words. Susan, that's what she's supposed to do. Wade, I stepped off the stand, and I looked, I looked at the jury and not one of them would look me in the eye. I don't think I can take it. If we lose this now, I don't think I can take it. We are far from finished here. Brianna still has to take the stand. What if she doesn't admit anything? Debbie protected Andrew until the day she died. What if Brianna is under that same evil spell? We gotta get back in there. OK? OK. I met Andrew at church and we started meeting up regularly. He counseled me on how I might get through my divorce. And how would you characterize your relationship? - Objection. - Overruled. At first, it was... it was very professional. But... But after a little while, Andrew initiated a relationship. A physical relationship. And you reciprocated? I did. Did this physical relationship begin before or after Debbie's passing? Before. - So, in the month leading up to Debbie's death, is it true that Andrew called you frequently? - He did. - How frequently? Sometimes more than ten times a day. Did Andrew ever tell you in any of these phone calls anything about his wife? Yes. He said he was gonna kill her to be with me. - Quiet! Order! - Please, continue. Andrew always talked about how he planned to kill his wife. But I thought it was a joke. You know, I... I guess the more he kept talking about it, the more I realized he was serious. What... What did he say? He joked about a possible drive-by. Then, possibly tampering with the brakes on her car or a poisonous milkshake. He finally decided that the appearance of a suicide would be best. Did you... Did you think he would do it? No. I... I never... But then, a week later, Debbie was dead and I didn't know what to do. I didn't see him that whole week. And then finally Andrew came over. And I thought for sure he'd have an explanation. But he told me... He told me how he killed her. What's wrong? I don't know. It's nothing. Well, it's... It's been a while. Yeah... I do have some pills for us to try. What kind of pills? You know, just something to give us a little jump start. - OK. - Yeah? OK. He said that he bought these scam, over-the-counter sex stimulation drugs, and refilled the capsules with sleep medication... Ambien. He said that the pills and the alcohol made Debbie groggy and confused. Debbie? Honey? Honey? - Wanna try something new, have a little fun? Sure. Whatever you want. It might be kind of hot if I put some handcuffs on you. OK. Say hello to Natalie for me. And she passed out. Was that it? No, there's more. Andrew told me everything. I was horrified by what Andrew told me. And I tried to run away And I wanted to tell somebody. But I was too afraid of what Andrew would do. Even though you were scared, you continued to sleep in his bed? I did. I'm humiliated that I did, but he's a master manipulator, wearing the mask of God. I've kept quiet for too long. I want to set things right. Mrs. Parker. I'm so sorry. I was just so scared. No further questions, Your Honor. Order, order! Court will be in recess for 15 minutes. The court officer will return the defendant to custody. - You did good. - Thank you, Wade. Andrew. Andrew! Andrew! Since Debbie died, you have not looked me in the eye. Can you look at me now? You murdered... ...the mother of your children. You discarded her like yesterday's trash and you left so many other victims in your wake. What you did was horrific, Andrew, horrific. And we will never fully recover from losing our Debbie. But we will go on, because love trumps evil. Did you hear me, Andrew? Love trumps evil. God sees you, and he knows what you've done. I'll pray for you. God bless.
