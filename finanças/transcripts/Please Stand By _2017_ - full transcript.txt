Light. It can travel for millions of years before finally reaching its destination. It goes lonely and alone... hoping that it will reach someone. But what if it never arrives? What if it never finds a home? Because space is so vast... and time is so long... and out here, it's so easy... to get lost. All hands alert. All hands alert. Radiation levels climbing. 35 percent. Raise shields. Shields are down to 60 percent. Still falling. Can I get a reading? Where is this coming from? Life support has been compromised. I repeat, life support has been compromised. Captain's log, final entry. The Enterprise is presumed lost. Spock and I are the sole survivors. Our destiny, unknown. I'm not gonna make it, Spock. You have to go on and save the Federation alone. Negative, Captain. I'm not going anywhere without you. Spock to Enterprise. "Enterprise, this is Spock."

I think she's upstairs in her bedroom. ♪ Say does that star-spangled banner yet wave ♪ ♪ Over the land of the free ♪ "Hang on, Captain... I am going to get you home." - Good morning, Wendy. - Good morning, Scottie. Okay. Can we try three seconds of eye contact? Let's try... three seconds. Great. Three seconds of eye contact. Yay. So, next week, your sister's coming to visit. How are you feeling about it? Out loud thinking, please. I'm feeling somewhat a little bit nervous. What does that feel like? Like I've got to pee, but I don't. That's how nervousness feels for me, too. But, you know, there's no need to worry, we're gonna make sure you're very well-prepared. Okay, now, can we go over your everyday schedule? My everyday schedule... Wake up. Make bed. Get towel and toiletries. If my towel smells funny, put it in the hamper and get a new towel. Go into bathroom. Check to see if I'm having my period. If I am having my period, remember that I am having my period. And how do you do that? I put one thumb up to help me remember. If I am having my period, put on a Kotex maxi pad, and put my thumb down. Put on an outfit. Monday, orange. Tuesday, lavender. Wednesday, blue. Thursday, dots. Friday, yellow. Saturday, purple. Sunday is red. Go into the kitchen to make toast. Unless Richard "the Fuck Face" is hogging the toaster. Wendy. Unless Richard is hogging the toaster. Go to work. Turn right onto Page Street. Turn right onto Buchanan Street. And when I get to Market Street, stop... Because I'm not allowed to cross Market Street under any circumstances. Wait for the 321 Bus to Stonestown Galleria. Remember to smile at work, while I say... Welcome to Cinnabon! Would you like a Cinnabon? But don't repeat the words too quickly. And make it sound different each time. Welcome to Cinnabon. Would you like a Cinnabon? Welcome to Cinnabon! Would you like a Cinnabon? Three pm, study. Yeah, see how his mouth goes down? - Okay. - Four pm, take Pete for a walk. When you see the man with the legs, it means you can walk. When you see the red hand, it means that you have to hold up your hand before you can walk. Six pm, watch "Star Trek" on TV Land. The ship is still functioning, Captain. It is logical to assume the mutineers are somewhere aboard. 7:00 pm, dinner. 8:00 pm, chores. And then I have free time before I go to bed. Beautiful. I think your sister's gonna be very impressed. - I think she will be, too. - I would be. I am. Okay, now it's time to work on your "Names and Places". "Names and Places" sucks! Well, it's not my favorite activity either, but we need to do it. Can I watch TV? Yes. But first, what do you have to be? You have to be very... Calm. Calm. Excellent. Coffee? Yes, please! Shit, no milk. Yeah? Ah, bless you. Thanks. When are you seeing your sister? Soon. Mm, that's good. And now, an important reminder... For 50 years, Star Trek has boldly gone where no one has gone before. So, the call is out and the contest is on. They want you to send in your script, highlighting the best of the Star Trek universe. So, fire up those word processors because your completed, printed script must be received by Paramount no later than February 16th. So, get your scripts done, it's just one week away. "He stood there, on the edge of reality... Only a thin membrane shielded him from the chaos beyond... Could he trust Commander Worf or not? He asked himself. He feared the worst. Spock looks up at the star-filled sky, surveys the barren contours of this alien wasteland... 'Escape is imperative, ' he whispers." Hey, Wendy. Hi, Nemo. - How's your script coming? - It's going excellent. I just wrote a sub-story where Spock travels to Deep Space Nine to recruit Commander Worf for battle. That sounds awesome. Uh... By the way, I... I made you something. It's got some really dope tracks on there. I really hope you enjoy it. I'm gonna clean the mixer. ♪ Oh, say can you see ♪ So, Richard, we've arranged an interview for you at the grocery store at the end of the street. Does that interest you? Yeah? Excuse me. Hello? - Is this Scotlyn Kyle? - Yeah. Ms. Kyle, this is Reginald Mayweather from Balboa High. Did you get out of bed today? At all? Okay. What's going on with you, Sam? You ever feel depressed? Angry? Mom, stop trying to diagnose me. Well, why aren't you in school? We had a deal. You go to school, you do well. That's all I ask. And you have a math test next week which, by the way, I just found out about today. So, young man, you are gonna study right here. Even my grandmother could answer your stupid questions. Dude, you might as well be asking her what the name of the ship is, how bout you find a hard question? Like in the back of the book. I got one. Okay. In the original series episode, "Court Martial"... what award was given to Mr. Spock? The Vulcan Scientific Legion of Honor. Oh, snap! Pay up! She's got to be cheating! She's got a cheat sheet. How can she cheat, dog? You're picking the questions! Maybe she's got the answers written on her papers! Look, look. Double or nothing, then. Okay. Go deep, go deep. Go deep. What was Dr. Leonard McCoy's daughter's name? Joanna. - What's that? - What'd you say? Joanna. - No way! - That's impossible! She got you! Pay up, bitches! Suck it! - Have your dirty money. - What the Spock. I don't know, dude, suck it. How did she know...? Should've asked her what Kirk's grandma's name is. What is Kirk's grandma's name? "Peering into the murky abyss... Spock saw something he had never seen before. A window... A portal to that other world... Not a vision, not a light... but a feeling... A feeling he didn't understand." ...didn't understand. Wonderment. Scottie, will you read my movie script for me, please? Sure. Will you read it as soon as possible, please? Are movie scripts supposed to be this long? Yes. Because it's an epic saga, it should be long, highly detailed, thorough. In my script, Spock travels back and forth through time to save the Federation. Wow, sounds fascinating. Towards the end, there are a few passages in the Klingon language, but don't worry, there will be subtitles. Good to know. You know, we can still take it with us. - No room. - Well... We could have it shipped. We can't afford it. I thought you loved playing. I liked it when Wendy played. I'm gonna go see if Ruby's awake yet. Hey. What? What's a "tribble"? It's kind of like a guinea pig-type thing, but without legs, or a face, and it reproduces like crazy. Wendy. Pay attention. Look. Fork goes on the left, right on top. Fork on the left. You try, your turn. On the left. Put it on the left. Yeah, good job. And the knife. You see the knife? Wendy, look at the knife. It goes on the right. Just like that. Wanna try the plate? That one's easy, it goes right in the middle. You can do it. Come on. Mom! Stop! Mom! What are you watching? ♪ Hey, lio-lio-lio ♪ ♪ Hey, lio-lilee-lio ♪ You wanna try? Yeah! You did it! ♪ Hey, lilee-lilee-lilee ♪ ♪ Hey, lilee-lilee lo ♪ Good job! "Spock looks up at the star-filled sky, surveys the barren contours of this alien wasteland. 'Spock, escape is imperative, ' he whispers..." Hey, Wendy. Big day tomorrow. Anything you need before I go? Have you read my script yet? I'm working on it. - Night. - Good night. Thank you for working with Wendy. I know how difficult she can be. To tell you the truth, I'm scared. Wendy's changed. She's made huge strides since being here. She's come such a long way. You'll see when you talk to her. I'll leave you to it. Hi, Wendy. Hi, Audrey. - You look nice. - Thank you. I like your outfit. It's so purple. So, I heard you got a job. Do you like it? No, it sucks, but at least I get to make Cinnabons. Oh. I brought you a picture of Ruby. What can Ruby do now? She can say "Mama" and "Dada"... and "Elmo". She loves Elmo. Can I have this picture of Ruby? Yeah, I brought it for you. When can I meet Ruby? Soon. I'm her aunt. So, Wendy, I came to visit today because there's something I need to tell you. Um, Jack has finally found a new job and... There's a Star Trek script-writing contest. Oh, okay, cool. It's a contest where they're having people write their own Star Trek movie scripts and I wrote a script. Oh, wow! Today is the last day to send it in, but I didn't want to send it in until it was absolutely ready. So, I double-checked and triple-checked, and quadruple-checked, and it's ready to go to the post office now. So, if we mail it, it'll get there right on time. It's ready to go. So, we can go to the post office and then I can go home with you. Wendy, we talked about this. After I win, I'll have $100,000, and you won't have to take care of me anymore, and you won't have to sell Mom's house. But I don't want to take you out of here when you're doing so good. It's not that I don't want to, it's that it's not a good time. Don't you like it here? No, I have to eat pizza on Thursdays even if I don't want to. I can't watch TV when I want to. I can't write when I want to. So, I'm ready to go home with you now, Audrey. Wendy, please don't do this now. I have a job now. I can get there all by myself. Ask me anything, I'll tell you the right answer. Please, stop. I can take care of myself now. So, I'm ready to go home with you, and I can help you take care of Ruby. Wendy, you can't. You can't take care of a baby. How do you know? How do you know I can't? Wendy... I'm ready to go home now, Audrey. I wanna go home. I'm ready to go home now. Scottie! Can you please tell Audrey that I'm ready to go home now? Wendy, it's okay. Have you been encouraging this? Shut up. We have to discuss everybody's future, where they want to be, where they see themselves. - This is where she lives now. - Shut up! Because Wendy, I don't think - I can take care of you. - Shut up! Shut up! Wendy, please stop. - Shut up! - Wendy, stop. Shut up! Please stand by. Please, stand by. Please, stand by. Please, stand by. Please, stand by. Breathe. Please, stand by. Please, stand by. Breathe. That's it. Please stand by. You're gonna be okay. Please, stand by. That's it. Please, stand by. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. Please, stand by. You're gonna be okay. Wendy. It's 7:00 pm. Come on, we have to move on to the next item in your schedule. It's dinner time. You wanna come downstairs? We're having chili mac. You know what? If you want, you can skip chores tonight and write instead. Okay, well... We can talk some more in the morning. Okay, Wendy? "Your completed, properly- formatted, printed script must be received by Paramount Pictures by 5:00 pm on February 16th." February 16th is this Tuesday. Today is Sunday. There's no mail pickup on Sundays. And Monday is a holiday. It's too late. It's too late. It's too late. It's too late. It's too late. Okay. Buses go to Los Angeles. I could take a bus to Los Angeles. How much will a bus to Los Angeles cost? Probably the same as the 321 bus, because it is also a bus. How long will it take to get there? I don't know. What if I forget where I am? What if I have to pee? Please, stand by. Please, stand by. Please, stand by. Please, please, stand by. I can't go out at night. I have to wait till sunrise. When is sunrise? "Come in, Enterprise... Enterprise, this is Spock." Go home, Pete. You can't come with me to Paramount Pictures. Go home, Pete! Okay. But you have to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, just like people do. Hello? Does this bus go to Los Angeles? Does this bus go to Los Angeles? Does this bus go to Los Angeles? No, you need to go to the Transbay Terminal on Fremont Street. That's on the other side of Market Street. Okay, thank you. Whoa, whoa, whoa! The other way, the other way! Okay, thank you. Wendy? Madeline! Wendy's not in her room. We've got to find her. Okay. - Wendy? Wendy? - Wendy? Wendy! We're not allowed to cross Market Street under any circumstances. You need a ticket. What? You need a ticket to ride the bus. Oh. You... need... Hey, little missy... Go buy a ticket! Where you going? Los Angeles. Excuse me? - Los Angeles. - One way or round-trip? What? Are you staying there or are you coming back? Coming back. Okay, round trip, that'll be... 86 dollars. I've got a ticket. It's a round-trip ticket because I'm coming back. Great. Can I have it? We have to be quiet, Pete, so that we don't disturb the other passengers. Mommy, there's a doggie in that lady's bag. I know, Pete. But you've got to hold it. Okay, I'll ask. Excuse me, bus driver. My friend needs to pee. Restroom's broken. Tell your friend the next stop's in an hour. Okay, thank you. Don't do it, Pete! This is what happens when you pee on the bus. Oh, wait. One second. Hello? Hey, Audrey. It's Scottie here. Listen, I... I got in this morning and Wendy wasn't here. Then, where is she? I don't know. I suggest you stay put in case she's headed your way. So, you have no idea where she is? Uh... I'm gonna call you back. "Bus restrooms do not work." It's okay. Her name's Madison. Hi, Madison. We call her Maddy sometimes, especially when she gets upset and starts crying. Maddy's very, very cute. Thank you. I'm an aunt. I have a niece named Ruby. - Does Maddy have an aunt? - She has three. Do you like being an aunt? I don't know. You don't know? I've never met Ruby. My sister's afraid I might hurt her. I used to have tantrums. When was that? When I was younger. That's so sad. But I can't imagine you hurting a baby, not ever. You can hang out with me and Maddy if you want. Come on. Now, come on. Come sit. So, where are you headed? Los Angeles. I'm going to enter a contest, a writing contest. I hope you win. I'm gonna say a little prayer for you. What kind of prayer? Oh, I don't know. A good one. Don't you worry. What's the matter? Here... - Do you wanna hold her? - No, no. It's okay. Look at the puppy. Oh! Wanna pet the puppy? You know what, me and my boyfriend, we're actually going down to L.A. So, if you don't have a ride, maybe you should just come with us. Yeah? Would you like that? I'd like that very, very much. Okay, then. Let's go, Jules. You ready? I've got to fill up my water bottle first. Okay. - Give it to me! - No! Give me my notebook back! Give me my notebook back! I'm sorry. They stole my iPod, Pete. ♪ Hey, lilee-lilee-lilee ♪ ♪ Hey, lilee-lilee lo ♪ ♪ Hey, lilee-lilee-lilee ♪ ♪ Hey, little gal, won't you come out with me? ♪ ♪ Hey, lilee-lilee lo ♪ ♪ This side of myself that I want you to see ♪ ♪ Hey, lilee-lilee lo ♪ ♪ Hey, lilee-lilee-lilee ♪ ♪ Hey, lilee-lilee lo ♪ ♪ Hey, lilee-lilee-lilee ♪ ♪ Hey, lilee-lilee lo ♪ ♪ Hey, lilee-lilee lo ♪ ♪ Hey, lilee-lilee-lilee ♪ Her name is Wendy Welcott. Oh, God, I hope she's okay. ♪ Hey, lilee-lilee ♪ Hi. So, she was on a bus heading to Los Angeles. The driver removed her just off the I-5. - They're trying to locate her. - What? We are doing everything we can to find her. And if she calls you, let me know right away, okay? Yeah. Where's my money? How much do all of these candy bars cost? Uh... A buck a piece. It says there are 18 inside, so that's $18. Yeah, 18 dollars. What? Don't cheat her. That candy is $2.99 and you know it. Don't be looking at me with your squinched-up face. You were gonna take her money, and that's called stealing. Now you apologize. I'm sorry. That's better. Honey... Don't let people take advantage of you, okay? I've got a grandson like you. Sweetest boy in the world, but he always has trouble trying to figure it all out. This is my niece, Ruby. Oh, she's adorable! So, where's your family? 992 Heath Road, Oakland, California. You mean you're out here all by yourself? No, I have Pete with me. Yeah, but who's taking care of you? I am. Oh, honey, that's not right. You shouldn't be out here all by yourself. Why don't you come with me? - Where are you going? - She's out there. Alone. Somewhere between here and Los Angeles. Okay, so what, you're just gonna drive down the interstate looking for her? Yeah, I am. I can't just sit here. I'm going. There's plenty of breast milk in the fridge. Are you going to Paramount Pictures to be an actress? You're pretty enough. No, I'm a writer. I wrote a script. It's 427 pages long. Oh, my goodness! What's it about? It's about two old friends who are separated. And one of them, Spock, is a Vulcan. He discovers how to have a sense of humor. He makes a special study of the anatomy of jokes which were a part of old, or primitive, Vulcan culture. He relates different parts of a joke to different facial expressions according to old holographic archives... and he figures out a scientific equation for a sense of humor. Oh, I wish my grandson could meet you. He would so get whatever it is you're talking about. He would think you were pretty cool. I'd love to see him more myself. But I'm here and he's there. Why don't you live with him? I don't wanna be anybody's burden. People have their own lives, and after a while, those lives don't include you. Yes, her name is Wendy Welcott. She's 21 years old. Five-foot-four, blonde. Thanks anyway. Miss? Miss? Can you hear me? Miss? What's she saying? Welcome to Cinnabon. Would you like to try a Cinnabon? No fractures, no bleedings. Suspected mild concussion. They wanna keep her for a day or two, but we're just waiting on a bed. Would you mind grabbing her chart? I have to go. I want to go. I have to go. Wendy Welcott. We've got four Jane Does in here. Well, she's five-foot-four, blonde. They've all got blonde hair. They're all five-foot-something. Hell, we even have a Jane Dog in here. Wait, what did you just say? We've got a Jane Dog here. John Dog. Is he wearing a Star Trek uniform? A what? A Star Trek uniform. Is he wearing one? Oh, yeah, he is! Ah, look at that! That's so cute. Okay, where are you again, exactly? Hey, wake up. I need you to get dressed. You're coming with me. Mom, what's going on? Oh, a patient of mine ran away. So, please just go get dressed. Where are we even going? Bakersfield. What? She's trying to get to L.A. and turn in a script for this competition. Is it any good? - What? - The script. Oh, I could only get a few pages in. I don't get it. What don't you get? Okay, so, I know he's the hero of Star Wars, but who exactly is this Kirk person? Please, crash this car right now because we both deserve to die! Sam! In Star Trek... - Okay. - James T. Kirk is the captain of the starship Enterprise. Right, that's the spaceship they're on, right? Yes, yes, the spaceship. Great job, Mom. But why does she find it so fascinating? That's what I don't get. I don't know. Maybe it's the characters. What do you mean? Like Spock, for example. He's half-human, half-alien. He has trouble dealing with his emotions. Where did it say that? That's just how he is. Have a good one, okay? You are going to Ward C. I don't want to go to Ward C. I want to go to Paramount Pictures. Well, I'm sorry, little lady, it looks like you are going to Ward C. Where am I? You're at the hospital. You hit your head. Where's Pete? - Where's my dog? - He's okay. The nurses have him. They gave him a little bath. Let's get you outta here, huh? Away we go. I've got to pee. You can pee when we get you upstairs, all right? No, I've got to pee right now. Right now, I've got to pee. - Right now. - All right, okay, okay. Let's make it quick. I heard you scared the crap out of a cop. My dad was a cop. Yeah, he had this walrus moustache and everything. When we were kids and we misbehaved, he used to give us demerits. "You loaded my gun wrong. That's a demerit." "It's the wrong Elvis record. Demerit." "Clothes on the floor. Demerit." And if you were lucky enough to get enough demerits, you had to sleep in the shed. Even now when I come home, he's like, "You'd better move out of the house soon, or I'm gonna make you sleep in the shed." Cut it out! That's not a funny thing to joke about. You know, I'm your son. Show me a little respect. Don't joke like that. Just quit kidding around. You all good in there? That's a long pee. Okay, I'm gonna come inside, all right? I'm coming in! She jumped out the window! She jumped out the window! I'll come back for you, Pete. Wendy! Hey! Yeah, I'm on my way right now. Oh, my God! Oh, my script! My script... My... Hey! Stop! Mom... This is Wendy's script. Wendy? Wendy! You need to calm down. Getting angry is not gonna help the situation. Hey, I am not angry. Nobody's angry here. I'm just trying to figure out what the hell is wrong with you people! Whoa, easy now. Come on, Scottie. Nothing is wrong with us, ma'am, but given the way you're speaking to me, I guess something must wrong with you. Hey! Something's gonna be wrong with your face if you don't stop talking to my mom like that! I'm gonna need the both of you to calm down. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but this is just completely unacceptable. Where's my sister? - Are you Ms. Welcott? - Yeah. Where's Wendy? I am sorry, but... she slipped by the duty nurse. We have no idea how, but we've looked everywhere for her. We've got officers up and down the state looking for her now. What was she doing here anyway? Was she hurt? How did she get away from you people? Can anybody tell me anything about my sister? "Your completed, properly formatted, printed script must be received by February 16th, 5:00 pm." "Your completed, properly formatted, printed script must be received by February 16th, 5:00 pm." "Your completed, properly formatted, printed script... must be received by February 16th, 5:00 pm." Please... stand by. Please, stand by. Please, stand by. Please, stand by. Please, stand by. Please, stand by. My script. My script. It's gone. It's gone. "Captain... there is only one logical direction in which to go... Forward." "Captain's log... Final entry. 'The Enterprise is presumed lost. Spock and I are the sole survivors. Our destiny, unknown.' Spock looks up at the star-filled sky... surveys the barren contours of this alien wasteland. Peering into the murky abyss... Spock saw something he had never seen before." Maybe this is my fault. "Escape is imperative... Spock cradles the dying Kirk in his arms. His captain. His friend. Kirk looks up at him, the light dimming in his eyes." Do you know where the bus station is? "'I'm afraid, Spock.' Spock is calm, reassuring. 'Don't be afraid, Jim. The unknown is there for us to conquer, not to fear.'" Do I need a ticket to ride the bus to Los Angeles? Yes, you do. But the next one is not until 8:00 am tomorrow. I'm sorry. 8:00 am is in 11 hours and 13 minutes. I'll wait. "Slowly tumbling through the emptiness of space... the lights of his spacesuit illuminating him in the darkness." You can't sleep either? "Tiny, alone... a single speck of light in a sea of night. For the first time... No stories... No echoes... Nothing in his head. Just silence." Silence. I hope she's okay. She's a very resourceful girl. To tell you the truth, I'm kind of impressed. She used to be afraid of everything. This can't be easy for her. Maybe I underestimated her. Your sister... is one of the most complex and creative people I know. Yeah. I mean, she's not always that easy to figure out. She can really try your patience, that's for sure. Yeah. My mother was so patient with her. She took care of both of us, by herself. - Single mom? - Yeah. Yeah. After our mother died, I tried my best to take care of Wendy. But then I got married, we found out we were gonna have a baby. I'm always amazed by how easy it is for some people to be able to handle it all. Miss? Miss? I'm sorry, but I need to close up. Do you have any place to go? Paramount Pictures. Can I wait outside for the bus to Los Angeles? Well, I can't stop you. But you be careful, okay? I am careful. I don't walk when the sign says, "Don't walk", and... I only crossed Market Street one time. Okay. Go into bathroom. Take a shower. There is no shower. That's okay. It's okay to skip once, but not twice. Madeline said so. I've got to change. I need to buy a ticket to Los Angeles, please. That'll be 22 dollars. That's not going to be enough money. It's $7.52, I counted it. - Next. - But it's almost enough. I need to get to Los Angeles today because today is the contest deadline. $7.52 is not enough, I know, but is there some way that... Next customer, please. Can it be enough? Please. Just for today? You're holding up the line. Let's keep moving. Any news? Where do you get on the Lankershim bus? That her? Do you know where you get on the Lankershim bus? That's her. Hey, miss? Miss? Hey! Hey! Stop! Back in, back in, back in. All right, all right. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy, come out. We won't hurt you. - I think she's in there. - Just, just... You'll spook her, okay? Wendy. Wendy! Hey, man, what language is that? Forget about it, Doyle. It's nothing, okay? I didn't know you spoke a foreign language, bro. What was that? Klingon, all right? - Damn! - Shut up, Doyle. Yes, I speak English. They found her! She's at a police station in downtown L.A. Sam! So, what happens next? Spock starts to experience the pon farr. On top of everything else he's going through? Yes. And all of his emotions rise to the surface and they start tearing him apart, and he has to figure out how to control them. That's amazing. That's amazing! But I'm not going to make it. There's still over 100 pages missing. Oh, Wendy. - Hi. - Hi. I've been so worried about you. Oh, God, we were worried sick about you! What did we say about crossing Market Street? I'm not allowed to cross Market Street under any circumstances. We found your script. We can still make it. Qapla', Wendy. Qapla', Frank, yaS. Hey, I really liked your script. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it was really good. When Spock has to travel back in time with the Elixir of Light to save everyone, he sees all these people that he loves die, right? Even Kirk. And he wants to save all of them, too, but he can't, because he knows they died for something good. I really think it could win. You need to get over. Did you get that peanut butter and jelly sandwich that I left you? I missed you a lot. Mom, it's right here. Turn here. There it is! Stop the car! - Wendy! Stop! - Go, Wendy! No, let her go. She'll be okay. I can't walk. Everyone stay in the group, please. Now, over here is the soundstage where they shot "Indiana Jones." Excuse me. Do you know where Building 1500 is? Yeah, it's just up and to the right. Where are you going? I need to drop off my script. Ah, yeah, you can't drop that off here. "Your script must be received by February 16th at 5:00 pm." Yes, and we only accept entries by mail. Okay? But this is the mailroom. Look... We don't accept personal deliveries. All scripts must be postmarked and mailed. No exceptions, okay? Piece of shit... Do you know how hard it is to write something? Do you know how hard it is to write something? Do you know how hard it is to write something? Do you know how hard it is to write something? All the thinking and planning and re-writing of everything you already wrote for somebody else to read? All the nights and days spent thinking? Thinking about the right words to say... thinking about the best way to say them? Because the story you wanna tell means so much to you? All those people that wrote those scripts, somebody's going to read them. And I just want a chance! Just like everyone else got! Somebody call security. Do you know who I am? What did you just say? Do you know who I am? No. Good. Hey! Hey, stop! Thanks. So did it get in? Oh, Wendy! Wendy, you did it! Oh, my God! - Thank you. - Oh, yeah. Bye. I'm so proud of you. You turned in that script all by yourself. You said you wanted to show them... and you did. But I wanted to show you. Yeah. My iPod was stolen. I'll get you a new one. You will? I'd really appreciate that. Wendy, I've been thinking... And... I've been trying to figure out... what Mom would have wanted for us. Well, Mom's dead. So, she doesn't want anything anymore. "'Come on, Captain. We can do this together. Don't give up now.' Their final moment had come. There was no going back. With his dying breath, Kirk lifts his visor. Spock looks into his friend's eyes for the last time. Kirk knows it is time to set Spock free. Free to find his human heart. The End." Epilogue. Everything would be okay. Scottie had said so. But where was that tiny speck of light traveling through the universe? Different from the others... hoping to get where it's going? To where it belongs? "Dear Wendy... Thank you for submitting your script to the 'Star Trek: To Boldly Go Writing Competition.'" I've been reading your script. You're an excellent writer. You really are. Thank you, Scottie. You're welcome, Wendy. "We are writing to thank you for sharing your story with us. We are thrilled with the talent and hard work that you have displayed." This is for you. Jeez, thanks. Uh, hey... Did you ever turn your script into the contest? When will you find out if you've won? Soon. - Fingers crossed. - Fingers crossed. "Unfortunately, your script was not selected as one of the winners... But please do not be discouraged. Never stop writing... Never stop telling your story. We hope to read more of your work someday. Until then... live long and prosper." Hi, Ruby. Can I hold her, please?
