That's so cruel. Did you notice Helen earned a new Wood Sprouts badge? For Independence. Baby, why--? You're not still wearin' the same old uniform every day? Baby, when our oil wells hit, I'm gonna pay for the most fancy French designer, like... like your Mom always wants. That uniform's an insecurity thing, Lubbock. Sprouting's the only constant in her life. I mean, they could use a little design help. That's all I meant. Rufus. Wrap it up here, darlin'. I tell you what...

The company arranged for a turnkey move-in. All we have to do is turn the key. How about that? Come on. I can't wait! I can't wait! "Crime up 90 percent!" Oh, we checked it all out. Trust me - this is a safe neighborhood. Oh, my goodness! Hold still. Be careful. Hold still, baby. You're all right. A bully! He stole my Elka! If he hurts her I will die! It's okay, sweetie. What happened? Are you okay? Are you hurt? No, merci. This morning in our back alley I see a white truck... and then my Elka is missing. So then I see the truck again! So I follow the thief here. They call this turnkey? What? Where's your new sofa? He just steal it. Lubbock! That white truck has our furniture! Go after them! Why? It's insured. Daddy! It's a crime. Poor thing. 911, okay. I'll call. Where are your parents? Traveling for the U.N. Argentina, India... but who knows. I stay with my Grand-mère for months, or maybe a year. I am holding. Well, dear... Kitchen stuff's here! Dear, what's your name? Marie Mier. Marie, meet your new best neighbor - Helen Hixon. I'll take you home as soon as you tell the police what he looked like. Punks... with the spiked hair. And... and they were terrible! Cops are worthless. Told me to take a number. Lubbock, where're you going? The office. Crime's not my long suit, okay? Lubbock! What about this child? It's okay. They love each other. This I can see. My Elka barks a lot, but she loves me... She's my only friend. Marie, maybe the police-- No... They insist she is just lost. They won't let us file a thief report for 24 hours! Can I help find her? It feels so hopeless. Never think that. Never. It's the first thing they taught us in Wood Sprouts. Wood Sprout's pledge: "Onward ever, backward never!" Let's shake on it. You don't trust me? But I must. I know no one else here. The thief, he wore a costume-- You tore it off the thief! Cool! Now we can track him down like the cockroach he is and crush him to a pulp. Let's do it! Your parents - they would not object? We won't worry them with the details. I promise to tell them everything when Elka's in your hands. Wood Sprout's pledge? Onward ever... Backward never! I'll never find another sofa like that one. Some thief has really good taste. No way! Yo, Craterface! What took you so long? It's red! Aw, it's a consolation prize. We missed the Hixon mutt. But, hey, we got the Frenchie's. Check it out! I'm gonna ransom that purebreed on the side and keep all the money. My uncle will never know. Good tip, Bart. But... take a breath, okay? D-d-d-d-d-- Do! Do I get m-m-m-- My! P-p-p-- P-p-p-puppy back! Can't you just say it? Not yet. The Hixon dog wasn't there, so you owe me one more tip. Then I'll set you and Doodles free. Aaaa! So, uh, suppose your uncle finds out you're skimmin' dogs? I'm not afraid of my uncle, Craterface. I'll just tell him to sit on a tack - a very big tack. 'Sup, Uncle Sal? 'Sup? What kinda respect is that? 'Sup, 'sup, 'sup, 'sup, sup-- You tell me what's up? What'd you do today? And don't lie to me! Uh, I think you might actually be proud of me, Uncle Sal. Proud? Because I have a nephew with the I.Q. of a donut... who ties up a little girl and steals a couch the color of a stop sign?! I... was just puttin' the fear into her. I was gonna cut her loose by supper. I wanna see you at the boat - ASAP! Feed Doodles! Shhh! Sure, Uncle Sal. I gotta go! Dirk! Oh, yeah... Ahhh! Helen! We've gotta hit the mall! Step it up! That uniform is not fresh. What will people think? That I'm a Wood Sprout? I can't take you shopping in our new community in total disarray. Where did I fail? I dressed you like a little doll. Your diapers were monogrammed. You told me! You'll just have to play with Marie today. I'll call her Grand-mère. Oh, hold on. If my calculations are correct, it should be right around the corner. So... what would a good sleuth do now? Ask the clerk if he knows who bought this? What if they're best friends? You have a nose for this, Helen Hixon. I am not so suspicious. We'll just pretend like we're normal kids... and see what clues we can pick up. Are we not normal kids? No way. That'd be awful. Hold on. Do this. Why? So we'll blend right in. Y'all ain't from around here... Are ya? Got all your teeth. Ew... Watch your bikes for fifty cents? Last one who didn't pay wished she had. Each! Watch your dog for a dollar? For deep undercover? Marie, look! They must have Wood Sprouts around here. I'll get it for you. Mom keeps hoping I'll buy some new clothes! Voila! That'll be six bucks. You kids are a little young for Punk, ain't ya, girly-girls? In France everybody wears them. We saw some Punks around here. Would they happen to be friends of yours? Those dumb Punkoids? Listen... They don't know their Punk from their Goth - or their Goth from their Metal. Or their Metal from their Biker. Or their Biker from their Vampire or their Rapper... And they don't take no expert advice. Well... we'd take some expert advice - on finding... those dumb Punkoids. Fine. My advice to you is don't. And, to you - it's get on back to France while you can still chew French fries. Dark forces rule the night around here. Could I please have my change back? You ordered advice. It's seven bucks... each. Bye. And you're a dumb dog. Don't you forget it! If I weren't a Wood Sprout I'd kill them! Stay cool, Helen. Have I told you how much I hate this place? I'll show you something to like. ♪ Blueberry Burst, please... Two. Say, have you seen anyone around wearing these? Nope. Surely you've seen them around. No! Pardon. Your hair was in my cup. Could I please have another? Why certainly. Have a nice day. Go ahead. It's good for you. I'm not thirsty, Uncle. It's 105 degrees out there. You're sweatin' your buttons off. You're tellin' me you're not thirsty? You wonder about what's in it? You don't trust me? No, sir... I mean, yes, sir! Trust! When your old man went to the slammer he told me to take care of you, put a roof over your head and treat you like a son, didn't he? - Didn't he! - Yes, sir! Then you went off and got greedy... started skimmin' some of the cream dogs for yourself and your little punk gang. Now you're doing deals on the side, aren't you? No, I didn't! I wouldn't-- No more lies! Shut him up! Shut him up! Get him out of here! No clues... no ice cream. No Elka. Okay, Plan B. We know the Punk kids ride in a pack. So I say we just keep moving until we spot them, then secretly track them down to their hideout. Secretly? Looking like this? We need to go undercover. Anything in Grand-mère's closet? We can't disguise ourselves as grandmothers. Her attic's full of old stuff. I'll ask-- No! Don't ask! Then we don't have to disobey. Say, uh, they who you lookin' for? Yes! Want me to go after them? We're on it. Todd! Hey! My sister's a Wood Sprout. Them or us. Hurry, Marie! With no disguises to fool them? Onward Ever! ♪ You broke my heart, son. I'll pay you back! You'll pay me back, huh? You've got 48 hours to come up with ten grand or you're takin' a swan dive. Hey, Dirk... Listen for 48 of these! I can't believe we lost them. You better shut that dog up! I didn't cop a wink last night. It wasn't her dog! Elka was kidnapped. Good riddance! The same to yours if he gets one blade of my grass under his vile little paws! Why are you dickering with that poor old lady? You know better. But Grand-mère-- Her hearing aid is out. Sorry, what did you want to say? She's a mean old witch and she deserved it. She hit you with a switch? Well, then she deserved it. Good day. But please don't say anything. I have to find my hearing aid. You've got 24... You've got 24 hours to get me ten grand or Pinkie is toast! I'm still looking. If it's important, don't hang up. Now, how may I help you? You heard me! You got 24 hours! It's the money or the mutt. I was with the French Resistance! What're you talkin'-- Uh, listen... You get me my ten grand or I'll mail you that dog's ears! What about your ears! Maybe I'll Fed Ex them someplace. I will not be extorted! What's the French Resistance? Chem City Police Department. This is a taxpayer! And don't you dare give me a machine or be one! Whoa... No, Helen! We mustn't touch that! She's never let me. It's just old World War II stuff, I think. Cool. Do you think there's love letters? No. Probably just old... Wood Sprout's word? About what? Okay, Wood Sprout's word. Grand-mère was a spy once. You've been eating way too much escargot. It's true! A Jewish spy in the French Resistance, sent to a Nazi camp, where nobody came back from. But she came back. It was a miracle! She helped hundreds escape and burn down the prison. She's a legend in France! And my uncle signed the Declaration of Independence. That's it! It's film. She was a spy. Helen! Helen, are you all right? Helen! Helen! Hold onto your cookies, girlfriend. It's payback time! Helen! Bring it on! Bring it on! Helen, you've gone mad! Good riddance! Drop the Bracelet, Helen! Are you with me or against me? - That's not right, Helen. - Out of my way! Marie! Marie! Hey, kid. You're takin' up space. You obviously can't afford nothin', so you might as well get on home. I have some money in my shoe. Oh. Hey, kid, you want a little advice? - No, sir. - What? Yes, sir! I think you should go fishin' in that shoe of yours for seven bucks - and then maybe me and you can have a little conversation about loitering! "You're a dumb dog, and don't you forget it!" What?! Shut up! I rented these for my 20 bucks. Onward Ever?! Backward Never! Come on. Let's go get 'em together. How about a Hot Fudge Hairball, girls? Go, Helen, Go! Helen Hixon on the mound. It's a rout It's a bust It's a fest of pure disgust He's so icky He's so sticky And we're picky Girl, you know whose side we're on Win at this Disgustathon! Get him, get him, get him... That's all you've got? Huh? He's outta there! En route to Ethylene Park. Helen! The dognapper punk - I saw him here earlier! He went that way and disappeared. He had a boy - like a little angel - on his shoulders. Let's track him! Actually... let's do it tomorrow... in disguises. Thank you, Nick. We'll check with you again later. We have a live report now about that commotion at Ethylene Park. Let's go to our reporter on the scene. A costume clerk and an ice cream vendor were ruthlessly savaged today by two young girls. Here's one of their innocent victims now. Like, dude, you know any personal injury lawyers? What are girls coming to these days? But in my day... we kicked some serious derriere. That's going back in the trunk... forever. We can't help Elka behind bars. And if the police don't kill us, then Grand-mère will. Maybe we could use it for good. Like you did today? Power is scary. I didn't even think of finding poor Elka when I had it on. You should try it, Marie. Maybe you're a better person than I am. Not better, Helen. The Bracelet changed you. With that much power, I don't know what I would do. Try once? No. We agreed to Plan B. Plan B... Undercover operations. I got you this. That's great. Open up, ma'am. Chem City Police Department. We are so busted. Take the back door! Open up, ma'am! I must talk with you. What is that Helen girl teaching you? Please, Grand-mère... I swear. Helen didn't teach me anything. My sweet Marie... that arm thing has a very dark meaning for me. You never talk about it. I will not speak his name - that man, who recruited misdirected young people into a group which gave them prestige and make them feel powerful. He was the problem - the leader. He was the most evil man in all of history. He and his followers turned the world upside down. Hitler. Yes. You were doing the salute Nazis gave to honor him. I'm so sorry. I didn't understand. I just want you to be careful who you follow. The Wood Sprouts... they have a conscience. And this is a good uniform. What do you think, Rufus? Punk enough? The dognapper! He is trying to ransom my Elka! Grand-mère won't pay - on principle. Oh, Marie... Take my allowance buildup. There's maybe 200 bucks. He wants ten thousand. It's okay, it's okay. I am plugged into the biggest girl network in the world! We're in luck! After I lose the spike. Helen... You're a real friend. Mom, can you watch Rufus while we make the Wood Sprouts meeting? How wonderful! See? You're already fitting into our new community. At ease, Mom. Just keep Rufus inside and lock the gate behind me, please. Looking pretty in your contacts! All set, Marie! Honey Hixon. Police. We found your sofa. Really?! Got dumped. Oh, really! Where! No, no, no - where exactly? Ridge and Third, okay? Yes, I'll be right there. Okay, okay. Thank you! I'll check this one. Cutie. Hello again! I made divinity fudge and delivered it to the Senior Center... along with two cases of Depends and a wheelchair. And I feel just great about myself! My daddy left the windows open at the carwash, and I volunteered to dry the seats off without complaining. Oh, very good. Ah! A new Wood Sprout. Welcome to Chem City Troop A! Please come and introduce yourself. Hi, I'm Helen... and I'm actually here to ask for your help. Is it sympathetic? I need my sympathy badge. Courage is the hard one. My mom won't let me do anything courageous. Mine will! You'll help ransom my friend's stolen dog. You'll meet Marie shortly. Not now, Sprout. We have to organize this. Now, who can volunteer to... Here, boy! Come on! Here, boy! Come on. Here, boy! We'll do everything we can for Elka. Thank you. Bless you for bringing us such a worthy project. Onward ever! Excuse me. Three more dogs got stolen this year. My uncle's a veterinarian. What's his name? Uncle El. Could you get me his whole name? Okay. Well done, Wood Sprout. I'm recommending you for a persistence badge. It's a crime ring of some kind. Why don't the police know? ♪ ♪ When you've lost someone ♪ And you need someone ♪ To give you a clue ♪ That brings them to you ♪ Show me the way Onward ever... Ugh... Rufus! Oh, sweetie, sweetie. Come here. Come sit down. I'm so sorry... but Rufus has been kidnapped. No! You were supposed to be watching him! Your mother was running an errand. What's more important than Rufus?! Well, look on the bright side. I just meant that your mother found her sofa. There is no bright side. I've phoned in the report. I'm gonna need to take the ransom note and the evidential fur-- Fur! It's not Rufie's. Poor Elka! That's evidence! Don't get your... snot on it. "Frenchie's dog bit the dust. Here's the hairy proof. Rufus is next if you don't deliver $10,000 by Sunday sundown - that's 24 hours. Stay by the phone." Poor Marie! Grand-mère should have paid! Now it's too late. Maybe she couldn't. Sugar, we can't either. Our bank's not set up here. We can't wire money over the weekend. Do extortionists accept credit cards? Lubbock, he's a criminal! Criminals are business people. Sir, they do not take credit cards. Forget it! I'll have the money myself by tomorrow morning. And just how do you plan to do that, little lady? Legally. Night. Night, baby. Don't let the termites bite! ♪ Ransom! Ooh! Money? You begged for money? Surely not in our new community. 90, 100... 200... Oh, no... 305, 310, 315... Now I'm a beggar! A beggar who gets nightly visits from the police, a-a-and who drives a weapon of mass destruction! What will people think of me? All that. But who cares? Excuse me... I'm sorry. Where're you going? The one place I can hold my head up high. 601... That's my girl. I'm just so sorry, Marie. Elka looked like such a nice little dog from the little sample I saw. Sorry. I didn't mean... At least it's all over for Elka. Poor Rufus... He still has to... Sorry. I guess there're just no right words sometimes. Onward ever? You can come in when you want to. And thank you all for coming to help two desperate strangers in the deepest and darkest part of their personal forest, down the mountain of despair-- But you're all here - from all over the county. Isn't it a wonderful world! Wood Sprouts Worldwide encourages girls to speak up and speak out for themselves! Marie is so grateful to everyone who sent in their donations for her dog, Elka. But, sadly enough, Elka is no longer with us. So... the donations will go to my own dog, Rufus, who was stolen yesterday. All right... A veterinarian is coming to tell us about three more stolen dogs. Meanwhile, does anyone have any allowance buildup they can donate to... Mom? Please, come join us. Come on. They'll love you. We feel so bad for you. We're so sorry. Sorry I'm late. Queen Elizabeth just dropped a litter. Hi. I'm Dr. Elliott Tynan. Marie. Helen Hixon. Do you know of any stolen dogs? Poor Mumzie Billows - she was the first victim. The cutest little dog named Doodles. Drat! Come on. I'll show you to Mumzie's house. We'll follow on our bikes! Thank you! Elliott Tynan! Come on in! How are you? Freshly single! Gotta make a house call! Don't stop at just one. We just moved here. I believe you sold us our home. The Hixons. Could we come in? Our dogs were stolen too... like Doodles. My baby boy was home alone when Doodles was nabbed. He never was able to give a description, it shocked him so. It's the angel kid... from the bridge. Angel, my ingrown toenail! Bart Billows, you get your dimpled tail back in here! From the bridge - with the thief! He's on timeout 'til he finds his glasses. Get upstairs! They've gotta be here somewhere. Bart! When Doodles was taken, did you see anything strange? Like a white truck? Or did you see one yesterday? Do you ever ride on a punk's shoulders? No! Hey, enough already! Would you treat a dog like that! Let me go! It doesn't add up. He couldn't hurt a fly. So... we know he pals around with the dognappers - and we know his mother was our real estate lady. She knew Rufus was coming... So... Bart found out and told Dirk! Maybe they left clues at your house. Be careful! Ahh! Helen! Say something! Uh, just investigating the crime scene. Me, too. Yeah, see you later. Those brats are gettin' on to us. It's a problem. I can't count that here. Are you okay? Mostly. That cop is dirty. Definitely. Guess whose. Bart's missing glasses? There's one way to prove it! Be careful! Gimme! Here fellow. Good boy. Want some more? Come over here. Good boy. Na, na, na, na, na! Give me! Na, na, na, na, na! Why were your glasses behind my fence? Gimme! Talk or I'll toss 'em. I can't swim. Helen! Liar! Told ya! Let me go! So you can swim. What else can you do? I-I-I-- You're faking it! ...can't-- You don't stutter. Don't mess with me! My main slack is Mafia! Right. Like the Mafia bothers stealing dogs! Who's really behind it? Mafia! Get him! Truce! No, for real! Dirk's uncle - he's even meaner than you! His family steals full-bloods and sells them all over the country. He fakes the registration. It's the perfect crime. The puppies can't talk. At two-thousand a dog, twenty dogs a day... Fourteen million? He's got a big load shipping out tomorrow night... with Doodles, if I tell anybody. Helen! Helen, Officer Breaux's concerned about your safety. He wants you and Marie to stop snooping around the neighborhood. Helen, your father's right. Did you find anything out? Nothing, Officer. Let me go! Helen! Think he'd go for 18.3 % in cash and a check on the Bank of Scotland? He got away. Is Officer Breaux watching us now? Yes! We've got to get Rufus back before the Mafia ships him off. How? It's too dangerous! You're right. I'd be better off alone. You keep Officer Breaux distracted. What's that smell? Is my shift over yet. Shut up! Hey, Uncle Sal! An unfriendly reminder - I want my money or I'm sending over Big Tuna. Tuna! How many more of those WooWoos he got comin'? Sixteen. Dirk, what happens to you if you don't come up with the ten grand? What happens to me? What happens to all of us?! Ever hear of Al Capone? His nephew whacked his way to being one of the most feared hitmen in the East. Took five deadbeats to his uncle's butcher shop one night - they were Italian sausage the next morning! Care to guess his name?! Salvadore 'The Fat Feline' Catanzaro - better known as Uncle Sal. Got his nickname for turning slow payers into kitty chow... which he feeds to his cats to this day. And who got us into this little predicament? I thought he might like to come here and apologize to all of you for ratting us out to the Hixon girl! What did you tell her? N-n-n-nothing. You stuttering creep! Tell me what you said! I didn't tell her anything! Tell me what you said or I'll melt you like marshmallows! No! He's not worth it. Want a little hot dog, animal lover? Don't hurt the puppy! It's that girl! Get her! Don't let her get away! Take the shortcut - the bridge! Head her off! She went left! No! Right! That's a good boy. I got a bad feelin' Dirk's gonna crack under pressure, do somethin' stupid. I sorta hope he does. Go get the ten grand from him tonight - and don't take no check from the Bank of Scotland, all right? What's that smell?! It's dog farts, boss. That's how they protest - by cuttin' gas. I'm not kiddin'! You're off your meds, aren't you Tuna? Aren't you? Maybe. You know how crazy that sounds - a dog-fartin' conspiracy? But it's true, boss! Maybe if you didn't feed them this pepper sauce all day, they wouldn't be fartin'! Clean this place up. It's supposed to be ship-shape on account of it's a ship! I heard that! I told ya! What'd I say? Huh? What'd I say? There you go! C'mon, Taco... give us one of your little popcorn farts. What'd I do? Helen? What the-- What happened last night? Bart was telling the truth. I saw Dirk's uncle. The paddlewheel boat is Mafia! The police are against us! The Mafia is against us! Who else can be against us? Your parents. I try to convince them that Ofc. Breaux is a dirty cop... but they give me a mental health lecture. Marie, the power's in your hands. I'd do it for you. The Bracelet was hidden for a reason. She didn't even offer it to help save my Elka. At least ask. The Bracelet is dangerous, Helen. Can't you see that? That's the tone I set for Dirk. I forwarded my parents phone. I've got the money, Dirk. All of it? 'Cause short won't do me no good. All of it. Well, then meet me at the swamp pier at six sharp. And no tricks or you and your little fur ball are gator bait. I'll be there. Alone. Alone. You are nuts! Going to see him at the swamp alone? And you don't have all the money? And what about your parents? How will they know? Helen, this is where you must stop! Surely they would die if something happens to you! And I also. You can watch my back. No, I can't help you any more. We could get hurt... or worse. So I guess it's just me now. No. Thanks... friend. ♪ When you've lost someone ♪ ♪ And you need someone♪ ♪ To give you a clue♪ ♪ That brings them to you ♪ ♪ When you've lost someone ♪ ♪ And there's no one there ♪ ♪ Life isn't right♪ ♪ When no one cares♪ Helen! Helen? Sweetie, come on downstairs. We have a surprise for you. Lubbock! Did you see Helen leave? Now stop being ridiculous. No daughter of mine is gonna be stupid enough to go meet a criminal... especially empty-handed. I'm glad our baby's home-schooled. Well, baby, you've been as quiet as a mouse. Your Mom and I know this Rufus thing needs to be resolved. You got the rest of the money? The next best thing. We're all gonna drive down to Galveston right now and see a champion litter of Papillons. You will have your new puppy tonight - if they take credit cards. You just don't get it, do you? You think you can just whip out a card and replace my best friend like he was a... a sofa? Darlin'... With all due respect, Dad, you can just keep your checkbooks and your oil wells, and, oh, your fancy French designer. And I'm not writing Rufus off. Babykins, I'm sorry about... I'm sorry about it all. We really want to be with you tonight. Is there anything... that we could do that would take your mind off of this horrible deadline? Ice cream! Albino Chocolada for me. And she likes, uh... What was it? Nature call? When you gotta go, you gotta go. Speaking of which... I think she's gonna be just fine. Fifteen minutes! Grand-mère, I have a very important question. I'm so confused. My dear, what is it? Let's say someone... anyone... me... has a chance to save a friend from danger - is it okay to break some rules, maybe make your parents mad by doing it? You mean make your Grand-mère mad? Well, it depends... without giving you a blank check... Why do you ask? Just a yes or no, please Grand-mère? It's not a yes or no question, dear. Sometimes there are desperate situations when people must do unusual things. If I hadn't broken some rules once, a lot of people would have suffered badly - even died. My mama wanted me to turn my head, but I couldn't. Thanks, Grand-mère! Why do you ask? I love you. Helen, is that you? Oh, I'm sorry. My daughter, she's... she's just... somewhere. To the swamp! Break a record! Helen Hixon? What on earth? It's a dog emergency, Doctor! Life or death! Dirk, it's time. Bart! Stay put. I'm gonna go get the loot, then I've gotta go take care of unfinished business. Ciao. Sure you don't need me? If I need slack, I'll call. I really don't need you, Dr. El. This is just kids fooling around. - See ya. - Helen... Drat! Hello. Good Rufus. It's okay, boy. There's Helen, Rufus! There's Helen! I told it's all gonna be all right. Drop it. Not until I hold Rufus. Get him yourself. Bon voyage! He's gonna blow any second. - We've got to swim for it! - There's alligators! Over there! If the gators don't get you, I will! We're sinking! Help! Look there! Helen! It's waiting for us to sink. Helen! Marie! Not again, punk! Throw it! Yes! Darn the gators! Full speed ahead! Oh, my gosh! Yes, I think I might need a little slack. Now! Whoa! What do you mean we have to wait 24 hours? She's a child. That's the rule, Ma'am - until we can declare her missing. That's crazy! But 24 hours? They won't authorize OT for runaway dogs, and I'm pretty sure that applies to pigheaded little girls, too. Our girl has disappeared, and if you don't do something about it in the next 24 seconds, they're gonna have to authorize OT just so you can find your missing teeth! Whoa, ho, ho. What seems to be the problem here? Our 11-year-old daughter is missing and and we're desperate, and we can't get-- Dr. Tynan wants us to check the swamp area. He's worried about a girl he dropped off there wearing a... a burqa? - That was your kid? - Yes! And why is it you don't look for lost children or dogs for 24 hours?

Blame? Never. It was meant to be. I must talk with you, Helen. First let me say I'm sorry. It's been over 50 years since I packed this away in Bordeaux. I was helping with the books... They were burning them, you see. In the bibliotec - the archeological library - there it was, on the top shelf... pulling me toward it like a magnet. I knew immediately that much would be expected of me, and that its power could only be used only for good. I think I wasn't, like, totally nice when I used it. I could have been way nicer. You're young. The important thing is you have passed the test. You can be trusted to do good. I couldn't. It's yours. I'm not 22, my dear. Let me bequeath it to a beautiful, compassionate child, who must have found it for a reason. It doesn't work for everyone. Trust that you will know when to use it and when to let it go. Guard it well, and use it wisely. Run along.
