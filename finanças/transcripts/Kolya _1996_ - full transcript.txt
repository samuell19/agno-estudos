Grow up, can't you? Coffee anyone? - Franta? - No, I must dash. Another job? You must be rolling in it. Can you lend me a hundred till Monday? You'll get it back I know. Or I wouldn't lend it Thanks At last! Your car is ideal. So practical Get yourself a Trabant You simply can't keep up. I'm sorry, but you can't. There are plenty of lesser cellists who can play at funerals. How much is a Trabant? - New or second-hand? - Second-hand You'd need a hatch-back. Twenty, twenty-five thousand Slow down They looked better from behind That's why I didn't look round Bills, bills! Vultures, the lot of you Helenka. It's me, Louka I suddenly felt so lonely so guess who I thought of? You, of course Would you be scared to spend a night in my 'tower'? To the theatre? No, I'm not cross. How could I be? Run along then. 'Bye Zuzi? It's me, Louka Zuzi, I suddenly felt so lonely so guess who I thought of? Oh, he's home? Right. 'Bye SOCIALISM - OUR SECURITY Czechoslovak socialism is now more democratic but unchanged in essence Economically inefficient, it has no regard for human dignity It's on the point of collapse Twenty thousand... ...for Trabant needing repair. Daylight robbery! This is Radio Free Europe Good morning The lettering needs restoring, doesn't it? - It's the rain - I could put it right I restore headstones. And it's cheap. A gold letter costs five crowns. Silver costs three. I recommend gold. The silver wouldn't stand out. How much would you charge? There aren't many letters Thirty-six letters. That would be one hundred and eighty crowns Why is it so expensive? Because you have to use... ...real gold dust Pity there are two T's in his name. You'd have saved five crowns Franta! You won't recognize the grave next time, Mrs Horáčková. All in gold. He makes me lie down in green pastures And leads me... ...the quiet waters by Do you know how long I've waited for this? Two years. Ever since that usherette's funeral - It's awful - All that time! No, awful that we measure time in funerals - like funeral directors You were never married, do you? My late father always said... If you want a musical career, don't marry Stay single Celibate, no kissing. Do you always get hiccups? Yes, always afterwards When it's... that good Try this Bite your little finger It puts pressure on the hiccup points Or try lifting your left leg at the same time as your right arm... ...so the blood drains out First time I heard that. What's that noise? It's the pigeons Sharpening their beaks on the window sill I must have got it wrong Lift up your left leg That's my right leg The other way about then Why did they chuck you out of the Philharmonic? I don't feel like talking about it Then don't Guess what? It works I told you it would Why are they sharpening their beaks? That's easily explained So they're sharp You are an idiot! - Hi, comrade - God bless you too I've loads of orders for you. Three in gold, two in silver Here you are It's all written down Mr Broz, a grave-digger like you brings joy to the whole cemetery You're doing it so well I'm trying not to smudge it. Mr. Louka, tell us about the concert in America. - Which one? - The one at the hall. - I already told you about it. - But Ladik hasn't heard it yet. We played "My Country" in New York. - By Dvorak. - By Smetana. Carnegie Hall was packed. We didn't get much of a welcome. We were tired after our trip, but we got a second wind. Which races were there? Chinese, Japanese, Mexicans... I wondered what this one big black fellow could get out of songs about places he didn't know. Now listen. When we finished playing you could hear a pin drop. - Then all hell broke loose. - Applause. We were in shock. It was like an avalanche. While we were bowing I could see the black man clapping. Tears were streaming down his face. Music exceeds race and nationality. I was beside myself. And I'm finished. Don't touch it! You only owe me 37,600 now I'm doing my best but I really need a car We could sort out the car problem Yes, but how would I pay? Exactly my point. I've a wonderful job for you 30,000 for a day's work Straight into your pocket Daddy, Andy has a tick Do you have a pet at home? No, no pets Do you have a baby? Nor a baby What do you have? Go out and play I'll deal with the tick I won't beat about the bush. It's a question of marriage I have this old 'aunt' I'm not marrying Least of all an old aunt - She's Russian - Worse still It's not the aunt, it's her niece Not even a niece Just a fake marriage No, I'm against marriage in any shape or form Cheers, cheers! She's visiting her aunt... ...and needs our papers to avoid being sent back Sounds fishy. It's not for me In six months you get a divorce - Is Andy here? - He has a tick I thought I'd lost you We're talking business - You know what I think - Leave us alone A fake wedding, Mr Louka. Just pretending! For 40 grand It was 30 before She'd willingly pay you 40 You could buy a car and still repay me 20,000 It's better than renovating headstones Graves, graves A heck of a job You've lots of pets A grave-digger has to have living things around him Her name is Nadezda. It's just a business deal I can't, Mr Broz. It's not for me Franta, stop that Come to see your mother, have you? Yes, how are you? - Hi Fanda! - Hi! -Surprised? They're finished already. - Know the name of this building? - Nope. - Coconut. - Coconut? Meaning "Communist church". - Hi. -Hi. - Geeze... Frankie! Go home and practise. Today was too awful! I thought you might come. Guess what I've made for lunch Potato dumplings I was in the chemist's. I said "I'll make him dumplings" That's great Vic has written. Look in the cupboard It arrived yesterday. He sent beautiful photographs. Yet you didn't even send a postcard. The Philharmonic was in Belgium. Were you there? I heard about it on the radio. You can't even drop your mom a line. There wasn't enough time. The Belgians dragged us around from pillar to post. Read it aloud Maybe later Sometimes I think you don't like your brother. What did he do to you? What he did was leave And you hold that against him? He went with nothing... ...and now he has a good business And I have bugger all You're a virtuoso player, you'll have money again one day Here you are. There's lots more Mr Holecek says we need new guttering - New guttering? - Yes The gutters have rusted through He said 2,000 would cover it Materials and labour I can't afford it. This house has cleaned me out I've had to sell my car. I'm in debt Where am I to find the money? Don't talk like that Frankie, the house is yours now you've bought Vic out But for that, we'd have lost it to the state, when Vic emigrated Would you want me to live with strangers? We'll finish our coffee, then we'll play. Okay? We haven't played together in ages. See you tonight! Just don't fall! Still playing for corpses, Franta? What about you? Still playing for gall-bladder patients? Yes. Come see us. The music at the spa is more cheerful. Bye! I'm hurrying to catch the bus. Goodbye, Mrs Loukova. You, maestro, are going to play at the colonade. What's this about corpses? That's what we call a concert audience... ...when it's dead and doesn't respond It was blocked here. Otherwise the gutters are in fairly good shape Except for the odd spot Well, I'll be blowed! How did this get here? It's not very valuable, Frankie Just a piece of costume jewelry That's not entirely certain. How did it get there? Where did you get it? I found it And what do you think it's worth? You tell me I could give you five or maybe ten crowns for it A couple are walking along your street She says "You and this trinket can both go to hell!" And she tosses it into the air. That's how I see it Mr Broz, I think I agree Of course. There's no other explanation I mean this bogus marriage. I might agree to it You can talk to Nadezda in German She translates from Russian into German I'm afraid I speak neither Oh, you Czechs, the story of your life! First you're allergic to Germans and then it's Russians It's not that. I've no head for languages Anyway, who cares how they talk together? Every Czech knows some Russian Every Czech speak a bit Russian Except me Except him? They won't suspect. What's important... ...is for Maestro Louka to know there are no tricks. Divorce in six months A fake wedding, that's all. No hidden agenda Nadezda has a little boy. And she's very young You could be her father. What would she do with you? Tamara, tell him it has to be a real wedding We want a real wedding There must be a reception... ...and a wedding night. Everything like a normal wedding A wedding night? The first night you'll sleep together. But in different rooms To avoid suspicion - in case you're followed A deposit Have you any idea how much it costs to fix Russian officials? You don't want to know Franta, I'm amazed Good luck She's a beauty, a real beauty! Must you be everywhere? - Hi, Eman. Louka here. - They're blowing their horns... Keep this to yourself. Huh? This is a fun place. - There was a girl who loved him... - Please be quiet. Don't tell anyone what you saw at Vysehrad, Eman. I don't want anyone to know about the wedding. - Don't sing so loud. - It's either all or nothing. Keep it under wraps. Who'd you tell? You're an idiot, Eman. And with his finger on the trigger he looks into the bushes... Friends Druzya I like my wife, Nadezda, very much I like my wife very much I've decided... ...that Nadezda my wife and I... ...shall enjoy a truly beautiful... ...real wedding night - What did he say? - A joke It would be a great pity if a Czech man denied... ...his Russian wife her unde... undeni... ...undeniable right - Wait, where are you going? - Frantisek, you drink a lot. Yes, we drank a lot... Fabulous, Mr Louka, but have a seat. Because we drank so much, I now ask that the guests such as Broz, return to their own homes and leave the couple alone. Come, Nadyezda. We should all keep in mind that a wedding night... You only get one wedding night. I'd like Nadyezda Ivanovna to remember Prague for a long time. And I promise tonight I'll be as hot- blooded as any Russian Don Juan Idiot! I'll be... ...a real Cassanova! Mr Louka, they don't understand your jokes. They're terrified Very proper Every bride should be terrified on her wedding night The baby's coming. The contractions have started Go home. Look after the children I have to go Nadezda! Wife! New, isn't it? Not quite No? It looks pretty new to me No rust anywhere These cars never rust Then it was a good buy Look at all those Russians! They're like locusts Would you believe it? Lots of Czechs do business with them It's certainly cheaper - diesel, petrol, coal But collaborating like that! Fine patriots, they are When the Russians invaded... ...people said they wouldn't even give them stale bread or water And look at them now Just as well you didn't live to see it I've brought you coffee and chocolate. Did you give a concert abroad? Where? I missed that. In... In Switzerland. The Swiss have always had the best chocolate. Like a lift? Is this your dowry? I see people can't keep their mouths shut It's a nice car You're better off in more ways than one - Look, this marriage... - I'm not interested I live alone Nothing has changed I'm such an idiot, I nearly divorced because of you Klara, let's go to my place Stop, I'd like to get out I want to get out I've done all your washing and ironing Great We're supposed to decorate the windows Another anniversary? I can't keep up with them They're judging again for the best-decorated building My windows are too high for them to see Don't you believe it. They watch us like hawks I darned two pairs of socks for you. Should've seen the holes. Put up one Russian flag and one of ours... ...so they leave me in peace That's 70 crowns. I'll add it to the 200 you already owe me You can have it right now Right now? I've no change Keep it How do you do? Mr Stocklasa sent me He did, did he? Hold this And what was Mr Stoklasa's message? He wanted you to look me over That is, he wanted you to hear me play - You're putting flags up? - No way. I'm too old for all that Like a drink? Yes, please I play the viola but I want to play the cello - Why... - Do that? I like the size You prefer big instruments, do you? Play something, then You've long fingers. That's good I feel nervous with you there Squeeze more with your knees Shall I play? Like that? Louka? Which friend? This minute? Who are you? Blanka We must make it some other time That's a pity I know Come to the Green Tree Come to the Green Tree! Can I sit or do we move again? It's all right here Are you a spy? Is grave-digging a hobby? Mr Louka, we're in deep shit Nadezda has emigrated Where to? Germany West Germany? She went as an interpreter and stayed on She's got a bloke. A married businessman She's nuts about him. But I thought she'd have him visit her here - Why not go straight there? - From Russia to West Germany? They're not allowed. Russians can come here but can't go there So how come she got there? Because she has Czech papers, thanks to you She left her son here, so she was allowed to go Why did she go, if he's married? That's her problem, Mr Louka But the cops are bound to get curious about you I knew it was idiotic. I felt it in my bones I'm sorry. But you'll be all right, you'll see The boy will stay with the aunt When should I expect them? - Who? - The cops I'd say soon Frantisek Louka? Yes. You're this lad's father? We've the old lady he was staying with, in our ambulance She's had a stroke. She says you'll take over But I'm nobody. I'm only his stepfather That's your problem. Sort it out among yourselves She says he's to stay with you Come on then Don't just stand there. Come on in Mr Broz, do you know what's happened? You knew? Then come and fetch him at once This wasn't in the deal We can't solve this on the telephone Pop by tomorrow I can't hear you One night won't kill you. Give him a bath and put him to bed You have some slippers? Something to wear indoors A fine conversation this is going to be! This is all I needed Here they are Slippers. Yours Take your shoes off and put your slippers on Look, stop snivelling. I'm not over the moon about this myself Stick it out for one night here and then it's off to the grave-digger's He got us into this mess. It's up to him to get us out Look what's here Some crayons and paper. You can draw Why don't you sit down and draw something? Scribble, scribble! Stare out of the window. What do I care? As you're so pig-headed, take a good look Eat At least drink your tea Tea Russian tea, what you lot drink non-stop I've put sugar in it Don't pretend you don't understand You must understand something We're both of us Slavs I don't speak Russian, you don't speak Czech... ...but you must understand the word 'tea'. We have it, you have it We use the same word There you are That's it Today there are 115,000 heavily-armed Soviet soldiers... ...in our country Stop snivelling and sleep. One night won't kill you Be like that then She was against the wedding Who was? Marush, my wife She kept saying "You'll get him into trouble" She was right there I know. So I can't ask her to take in a fifth child Mr Louka, our place is a madhouse these days Try to put up with him I'll let you off 2,000 Three, 4,000 Put yourself in my shoes. What am I to do with him? Can't that woman with gold teeth take him in? Pasha? She's in Leningrad Look, his aunt will be out of hospital in a fortnight Keep the boy. It's in your interest That's why the aunt left him with you - for your own sake Looking after your wife's child makes your marriage look genuine In whose eyes? The authorities', when they come to interrogate you You've been questioned before? I was. Once The first cop was a softie. The second was called Novotny He was sharp as a razor Mark my words, they'll pounce And they'll grind you down, Mr Louka When my old mother rocked my cradle... ...she taught me to sing... Mr Louka, you didn't put up the flags You said you'd do it I've been too busy. I'm doing concerts every day for the workers You're the only one who didn't do it. All the others did What a nice little boy. Who are you? He's my nephew What's your name? He won't talk, he's terribly shy I don't care about the flags but you're drawing attention to yourself I'm a coward Last year... ...I didn't give a damn and it was okay But we mustn't upset them now we're in the shit Ours - yours What was that? Ours Yours So you can understand when you want to The thing is, we put up your flag because we have to Once we put it up in gratitude But that was before we realised that you Russians are scoundrels You understand? No, you don't. You lot take up too much room Wherever you march, you stay But not you, you'll go back to your aunt The moment she's better, I'll pack Your chemodan and you'll be off Chemodan That's all the Russian I know because they stole mine in Moscow You steal suitcases and territory Ours is beautiful What's beautiful about it?

His mother has left... ...and you can't look after him He can't stay here - Look what he's drawn - A coffin, isn't it? It's not a bad drawing Gentlemen, the dead won't wait Are you his dad or his grandad? His grandad Fill in these forms and send them to Comrade Zubata - And when do you think...? - I can't say I don't understand. You say the boy is from Yugoslavia His parents let him come to you just like that? So he'd see the Czech countryside And why is he called Kolya? Isn't that a Russian name? Kolya is the same as Nikolai in Jugoslav Couldn't he spend a few days here? Who? He's pale He needs fresh air and he'd be company for you What's the world coming to? Parents leaving their kids just anywhere People with a career in music shouldn't have children Like you. It should be either music or a family How long would it be for? You see them? Always driving... ...back and forth Our soldiers No, not yours. They're Russian Look, the king Russians. Russian soldiers What's he saying? I don't know. Maybe they remind him of Yugoslav soldiers Here, Kolya, it's almost ready You lied to me. He's Russian Yes, I lied to you How could you do it?

You'll like it there Fancy lying to your own mother. Vic would never do that First you show no interest in children and then it's a Russian! Come and look - What's happening in Prague? - Same as here There's this soothsayer who predicts it will all collapse this year They've said that for 40 years He's had this vision. There were Communists buying... ...rods of gold They were rushing off in great hordes to Russia But Gorbachev took their rods... ...and used them to flog their backsides He said "Leave the gold here and go back home" But nobody wanted them any more The young people and nurses rebelled against them So they chased them out... ...and set up colonies for them in Albania... ...like Red Indian reservations What a vision! Why did the nurses rebel? I've no idea Our people? Yes, yours Going to Moscow? No, they're here to stay They just go back and forth Do they live here? Unfortunately, they do Just like me The shows's off. We had the Russian kids yesterday... ...but today there's nobody The show's off. Come along How big an audience do you need? At least five. But this is a Russian film 'Angelika' is on tomorrow Give me five tickets Mr Lansky, don't go. We're doing a performance Hi, Franta Where's my grandma?

Probably a parking ticket Now you'll have to go and see them, I suppose I'm Pokorny. You'll be Mr Louka - How come...? - I couldn't leave him But during the interrogation... Comrade, take care of this child He'll bawl his head off This is most unusual - You've no kids? - Yes, but I don't take them to work Maybe I could ask Jitka... Jitka, look after this boy.

If you've some paper and a pencil, he'll draw Sit down, Mr Louka You wouldn't have any crayons? He prefers colours So you decided to marry, Mr Louka? Well, well, how surprising. A confirmed bachelor like you... ...suddenly, at fifty-five! Yes, a man can go off the rails even at my age Well, she's very young and pretty - Love works in strange ways. - You know how it is Where did you meet? - In a restaurant - Which one? It was the Malostranska café She was sitting alone and there was no other table free - We got talking - You speak Russian? Only a few words. From school - Your cigarette... - Want one? - No. It fell out - That's always happening Very nice He draws well. That violin... Cello. It has a spike You're right. A violinist might stab himself My kid doesn't draw as well - What's his name? - Radek, after my wife - She has a man's name? - No, it's Radka really How's it going? Captain Novotny, Mr Louka My dear man, you seem to have a bad influence on your family Your brother emigrates, your wife emigrates... You didn't live together very long, did you? Nobody saw her at your place We lived together for a few days... ...but she only spoke Russian and me Czech Surely you were aware of that before the wedding? Of course. But there were other problems as well She kept opening the windows. She was so used to Siberian winters So we decided we'd live apart Okay, you've had your fun Now spit it out. How much were you paid, you jerk? Isn't that a bit familiar? I'll be as familiar as I like I call a jailbird anything I choose And that's what you'll be I asked you a question - Comrade, take this child - We tried How did you buy a car? I saved up and borrowed the rest From whom? My colleague Parizek and Mr Broz Did Nadezda Bilyukovova tell you she planned to emigrate? That caught me out And her son, that caught you out too? Absolutely What will you do with him? I don't know. Maybe I'll keep him now he's mine in law Look here, my dear man This marriage was a put-up job Tell your fairy tale about falling in love to someone else And don't think you'll be playing with the Philharmonic much longer You'll be lucky to fiddle at funerals. We'll make sure of that HE DOES FUNERALS ALREADY! Why not try to save your skin? Tell us who arranged the wedding and how much you've got for it This won't be the last time we meet. Go back home, and have a good think Then maybe you'll come back and see us before we send for you Well, that's it That's it... ...my dear man Two or three more interrogations and you'll be speaking Czech - If it isn't Marketa! - Mischa Of course - And what are you doing? - I play in a sort of ensemble Jesus, the boy!

I'll wait She's a teacher A fairy tale 'The Eagle and the Lamb'. Fantastic! I'll pass you over Yes, Kolya Bilyukov No, I'm not scared of eagles High on a Caucasian mountain peak lived an eagle One day he flew so high he reached a star On that star, there was a little house In the house, lived an old sheep and her lamb "I've come to visit you" said the eagle "I've come to see how you live" Lovely Thanks, Zuzi You left them here? Black lace ones? And you went home without them! No, I'd have found them I'd like to see you too, Zuzi, but I can't right now. I'll call you Bye. Hello What's your name?

Set your alarm clock With a quarter aspirin. You have some? Yes There's a danger of meningitis If the fever continues, apply cold compresses. You can do that? Yes, of course - Will your wife be away long? - Possibly You'll need a note for your employer I guess. It will feel a bit cold Hold on, it's going to be all right You'll be all right now Klara, I'm sorry about calling you out so late That's okay No, really, I mean it. Good night now No need to say good night. I'm staying till the morning And what will you say at home? That an old flame of mine had a child And he couldn't cope A magpie or a jay. They steal shiny things You're right. Nobody thought of that It's still beautiful, even if it has no value When I said we couldn't have children... ...I didn't mean that I can't. You must have misunderstood When is he supposed to take his next pill? At five. I set the alarm You're less selfish than I thought I never imagined you'd worry like this about someone else's child Neither did I Weren't you afraid to make that fake marriage? You a dissident, of all people I am not a dissident I've just been punished for my own stupidity They used to let me go to the West One time, the Party officer said... "Your brother has emigrated but we trust you" When I returned, I had to fill in the usual forms One of the questions was "Did you meet an emigré?" I wrote yes Then it said "State in detail what you discussed" I wrote "The usual shit, Comrade Blaha" Is that all? I guess he felt hurt And I thought you'd done something heroic! Bit of a let-down, isn't it? But you did it so nicely I want you to have this Lovely. And you've stopped drawing coffins Story by telephone You'd like a story? Good. Let's call the teacher auntie Could I have the one about the eagle? I liked that one It was the uncle. He's no good at stories We'll have to manage alone Once upon a time, there was a grandpa and a grandma A grandpa and a grandma They had a grandson who was called Budulinek One day Grandma said "Budulinek, my dear "We're going to the woods. You will be here on your own "Don't open the door to anyone at all" Don't open the door That's it. And so they left We had otters once What's otters? You keep asking "What's that?" It's an animal about this big with whiskers like me It eats trout What's trout? A fish Fish! But because the water is poisoned now by acid rain... - you won't understand and nor do I - ...the fish died Fish kaput? So the otters died too The otters are kaput too? So now you have a River Otter... ...with no otters in it Oh, my God! Some East German bloke is celebrating his birthday What's a birthday? That's the day he was born And when am I going to have a birthday? When were you born? You're five but when were you born? I don't know Then it's a bit difficult, isn't it? 'Night, Dad 'Night Happy birthday... The main thing is you're healthy and happy What's in it? Fantastic! Why must you live at the top? I'm from the Department of Social Security You sent us an application regarding this boy some time back We've only just got round to it In the meantime, we've sorted things out You play at night, don't you? No, only during the day now - Where does the boy sleep? - Over there He doesn't have his own bed? No, but there's enough room... So it's the boy's birthday? Not really. But I don't have his papers I wrote that application when I wasn't coping very well The boy is Russian? Not now, my dear He understands Czech now His mother went to the West and shows no interest in the boy That's untrue. She applied to the Red Cross - Look, Mr Mouka - Louka Czech nationality by marriage... ...she is still a Russian So the Russian authorities still have an interest in this child The matter may well be taken out of our hands They'll probably put him in a home That's my opinion Miss Zubata, that letter of mine... couldn't it be declared void?
