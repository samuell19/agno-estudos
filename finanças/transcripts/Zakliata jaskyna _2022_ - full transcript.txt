Once upon a time, there was a land of unrivaled beauty. The people loved their king for his mercy and kindness. Your Majesty. The kingdom's riches were safely hidden inside the secret depths of the earth. The people had found salt in a cave. There was enough for them and for all the merchants coming from far and wide. The kingdom was thriving, and the people were happy. However, the miraculous cave was hiding a secret. Only the two of us know the secret of our cave, Buchvald. Remember that, and always protect it. The depths concealed the very heart of the cave. A splendid ruby hall. And yet, the people knew that nobody could touch the gems. Anyone who dared take so much as a single ruby would be struck with a terrible curse. And with him, the entire kingdom. Ada! First snow, finally. Don't act so serious all the time. You act like a baby. You're it! Hurry up or you won't catch me. And father's lunch is gonna get cold. You are so slow! Lena, wait for me! Nope. Lena! Hurry up! Where is the crazy girl running to? Come on! Bread with cheese and bacon. With baked crust? Your favorite. Look at your daughters, Buchvald. Pretty as princesses, helpful and smart. Ada, where are you? The king's favorite salt miner and the world's happiest father. Only those who share their entire heart will be happy. Be careful, don't get lost. Lena, wait for me! Come on, Ada! You're still behind. Lena! Let's go back! Ada, this is beautiful. Lena! -Look! -Don't go in there. Typical you. If you don't want to go, I'll go alone. Lena! Who knows what it means? "Don't run so fast, Lena, you'll trip. Don't climb on that tree, Lena, you'll fall. Don't swim so far, Lena, you'll drown." You are afraid of everything, Ada. You can't do anything on your own. The ruby hall from the old legend. It's even more beautiful than what our father said. Do you think he's ever been in here? Father knows this cave better than anybody. If he'd seen this and didn't do anything… If he's carrying salt instead of rubies, then he is-- Lena. Do you really believe, that the one who touches the rubies will be cursed? Nobody would even to notice if one was missing. Let's just go. What could happen? Let's go. Maybe nothing would happen at all. Maybe it's all just a bunch of silly stories. You knew I was coming, right? Look what I brought. The king won't be missing this one rock. Hey! Run away! How dare you! Me? How do you dare? Do you know who I am? A coward! Only a coward would hunt an animal while it's feeding. "A coward" you say. You can't run away from me. I know you are here. Look at him, Victor. What kind of a prince is this? My brother can't catch even a simple girl. -Be quiet. -Ask nicely. Your stepmother is requesting your presence. Stepmother is not going to give us any orders. -What does she want? -I cannot talk about it, my lord. The deer and foxes shall cover their ears. Your father asked for your safe return by nightfall. He knows how to ruin an evening. Give it to me. You are talking about the king, Your Highness. When the princes were little, they lost their mother. Their father remarried, but even though their stepmother was beautiful, her heart was made of stone. Cold winter is coming It's a strange time Birds are flying in the mountains Shepherds are playing their trumpets Preaching what's new, unheard of We thank the forest for giving us warmth and food. We thank the herbs for curing our illnesses. And the cave for giving us a livelihood. We thank you, Buchvald. Because you always bring our men back safely to the sunlight. To be with us and our children. To Buchvald, the king's greatest salt miner! Merry Christmas! Have yourself a merry Christmas! -Cheers! -Cheers! This winter is going to be cold. But those who are smart and have two working hands… One donkey and a sheep… Can survive anything. You always say that, Father. Because it is true. And this old legend, you know, about the cave and the rubies. Is it true? Why would we need rubies, when we have each other? It wouldn't make us any happier than we are right now. I am so tired. I bet you are too. Good night. What does a wolf look like, Ada? It's terrifying. Now, go to sleep. The sooner you fall asleep, the sooner Christmas morning comes. Maybe you will get some nuts. Or ribbons. Ribbons? Don't be expecting gold and silver. I'm not expecting gold and silver, Ada. But something else. Something truly beautiful. -Open the gate! -The princes are coming back! Out of the way. Their Royal Highnesses are here. Announce us to the king. After all… Their Royal Highnesses, Prince Cyril and Prince Zach! You came. My sons. My time is up. Remember that you are brothers. Stand by each other's side. Don't argue. Help each other. You are stronger together. Have you made your decision yet? Am I going to be the king? You? Not a chance. You only think about yourselves. Rivalry has possessed you. Being a king is a duty. Responsibility. A never ending service to your people. And therefore… let the ruler of this kingdom… Let the ruler be the one who truly deserves it. The king is dead. Long live the king! But… which one? Who better to decide than me, their second mother? They lost their father. But they still have me. What if we rule the kingdom like true brothers? Not like brothers. No. Split in half. I will take the northern part. The forests and the cave. Forget it. The cave is mine. And the river too. Not a chance. Victor. Are you avoiding me? Your Highness. Now that I am single again, do you think that I will find someone young and strong? There is no one worth Your Highness. I'm looking and looking… and there's one. Keep looking, Your Highness. Salt. Ordinary salt. The strange night has woken greediness in many people. And the desire to own more than they need has brought them into darkness. What is it? Lena. That was a gift from our father. Lena! Wake up! My daughter, Lena! Can you hear me, Lena? Speak! Where are you, girl? Lena! Where are you? Where did she go? Where are you, Lena? -Father! -Come on! Father! Father! -What is? Wait. Don't delay, Ada. -Lena! I think she went towards the cave. But why? Why would she do that? Lena felt like your gift wasn't enough, Father. I think she went to take the ruby from the heart of the cave. We saw it together. Lena! I should have told you-- That cannot happen. It cannot! Let's go up. What is this? What is this supposed to mean? Where did the door go? Where are you? Where are you, Lena? How is it possible? No! No! Look, Father! That's the ruby from the heart of the cave. The king will tell us what to do. He is wise and experienced. Come. Let's go! Come on, come on. Come on, hurry up. What is that? Come. What happened, Ada? Over there. I saw something over there. Let's go. We are behind. Let's go. -Open the gate! -Stop. Don't make a move! Open the gate, we must get to the castle! Do you hear me? We must see the king immediately! The gate. The gate! Guards, let them in. Let's go. It's too late. The king is dead. Out of the way. This is Buchvald, Your Highness. His daughter is missing. What's happening? Your Highness. My Lena. She entered the cave and has been missing ever since. How could she get lost? What is she, a needle? Go look for her then. And stop bothering us. Nobody can enter the cave anymore. What are you talking about, poor man? Where once was a door, is now just a rock wall. And this was on the ground. Show me. My daughter took it, because she didn't know that-- She will be cursed. The sign of the curse will be a wolf. It's a legend, Your Highness. Every kid knows it. What wolf? I… I've seen it. Nobody has ever seen a wolf roaming the royal forest, little girl. But I've seen it. A wolf. Where are these two? Where are the princes? They will get a chance to be useful. Step aside. Move. Get out of the way for Her Majesty. My arrow hit right in the bull's eye. Right in the middle. Tell me, who's the best? You, of course. You, prince. You are the best. They've seen a wolf in the forest near the cave. A wolf's fur is the warmest. Let the one who brings him to me become the king. You can start the coronation preparations, Berta. You can. But mine. A crown will be worthless to you if you're dead. Don't let each other out of your sight. Take care of each other, boys. I'm telling you that as a friend. A king doesn't have any friends. Only servants and enemies. Goodbye. I will return as a king! The gate! Move! Anyone can kill a wolf. But not everyone can make it back home from the forest alive. Take care of it. And you will not go unrewarded. Let's go. Your Highness. Give it up, Cyril! You better hold on! You can't win this! Neither of you can, lads. I'm taking that route. You better stay out of my way. No problem. You won't be missed. You're not a wolf. You are a she-wolf. Come. Come to me. Come here. Out of the way, Cyril! Get out! Listen, or it'll run away! -If I move, you will shoot her. -And I will save your life. And you'll become the king. Do you remember what our father used to say? Every good ruler must learn to decide what is worse. What is worse in this case, my brother? That you'll become the king? Or that we both lose. No! What did you do, Cyril? You're the stupidest man in the world. I didn't want this to happen. -But it serves you right anyway. -You're my brother! Where are you going? Stand up and fight. So a king needs to make the right decision? Fight! Get up and fight! What? Are you finished? Did you poop your pants already? Admit that I'm the king and kneel. Cyril! -I will pull you up! -I can't, Zach! Hold on! -Hold on! -Help me get up! No! Cyril! Cyril! Cyril! Where is your brother? I saw you. -What did you see? -Everything. It's not what it looks like. I'll explain it to my stepmother. I wouldn't do that if I were you. But you are not me, Oplan. And you will never be. You're just Victor's henchman. If I were you, I wouldn't come back. You will be executed for killing your own brother. You've seen everything, you can tell the truth. Why would I do that? Your stepmother sent you out to die. Why do you think I am here? Let's go then. You have a sword, but you don't know how to use it. I'm trying to help you, young man. Trust me. Don't come back home, they will execute you. Nobody is going to say anything to save you. Nobody's going to miss you. You want some good advice? I'll give you some. Get lost. Disappear. Leave forever. And where am I supposed to go? Wherever you desire. Wait. Your sword. Your brother's and yours as well. Why do you need them? As proof that you are both dead. Horses! Something went wrong. Those are our princes' horses. Take them back to the stable. Most importantly, the horses returned. I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, Victor, but… this is not good. Long live our new queen. Both princes died in the forest. That's terrible. Why? You could have had it all, Victor. All you needed to do was reach out your hand. Oplan. Search the entire kingdom. Take all the salt you can find from the villagers. A true queen would never harm her people. Get them out. Out of my castle! Not that one. He will show me where the rubies are. Take him! No! No! Let him go! Leave him be, please! My father is all I have left! Please, have mercy! Mercy! Please! -Tie him up. -Leave him be, please! Get lost! Did you not hear the queen? Get lost, you poor village beggars! Please, let's go. There's nothing we can do right now. Let's go! No. We can't just leave! I have a wife and children. They need me. We have to go! Please, mercy! Now I am the true queen. On your knees. Kneel! Kneel! Kneel! Ever since, there has been no salt in the entire kingdom. All merchants avoided the kingdom. Fear and poverty spread over the land. Those who could, left their homes and did not return. Those who couldn't were left to hope that the curse would one day be broken. This is worthless! No gold, no coins, not even a grain of salt! Just stinky sheep and donkeys. That's all, Captain. There's nothing in here. Stop! I don't have any more salt. You took everything from me already. We will lock you up, little girl. Just like your father. Where is everyone? When you took our last reserves, they packed up their families and left. And why did you stay, beautiful? Because we have the prettiest boys, Captain. Let's go! We're finished here. Understood, Captain. Let's go. Let's move! Pull! Those who are smart and have two working hands, one donkey and a sheep, can survive anything. I'll go fishing, pick strawberries, blueberries and raspberries. I'll find ramsons and sorrel plants. I have flour. I can make pancakes. I can do this. I can't be afraid. I will find salt. I will find salt and save my father. Just as life is stronger than death, hope conquers desperation. Because those who keep their faith will always have a future. Wait here. I'll get us some water. If you want to drink, you need to go somewhere else. Is that you? -Is that you? -Watch out! In all my beauty. You are hiding. You are so smart. Why are you wandering around the forest? And you? I'm not wandering around. I'm looking for salt. What if I can help you find some? What will you give me for it? How about a hairbrush and soap? I prefer food. And shelter. Ever since the winter, I've been sleeping outside. That would require a lot of salt. Take a good look. Your donkey is smarter than any man. The water. It's salty. Salty! I will collect so much salt that everyone's heads will spin. -We will be saved. -Looking for a helping hand? I got two of them. I will make a deal with the queen. I'll give her salt, and she will give me my father back. Berta is no queen. She has a crown on her head. A crown doesn't make you a king. Seems like you know everything. Would you happen to know how to extract the salt out of the water? Maybe. But you would have to undress yourself. I figured it out in the winter. When I fell into the stream, remember? When my servant-- When I was undressing myself, the salt was just pouring down. If you could take the sheets… I don't think we need the sheets. We just need the water. Eat. You need to eat to get stronger. You have been sleeping for a long time. That's good. When a man sleeps, nothing hurts him. You were hurt. You want to drink? Slowly. Where am I? Inside the cave. I can see that. Be careful. Your ribs, also your leg. You're still weak. If you help me heal, I will reward you well. You will receive gold and silver, as much as you want. I don't want gold or silver. What do you want then? I'll give you anything. I am the king's son. I am the prince. I just don't want to be alone in here. You live here alone? With Lena and our father. Where are they? They're gone. But they'll be back. I will save them both. She's alive. I know that. I can feel it. What happened to her? She disappeared. The day the wolf appeared. -And do you think the wolf-- -No. What are you cooking? Porridge? Do not stand behind my back. Find something else to do. Milk a sheep, feed the donkey. Sharpen up the ax and then chop up some wood. Me? I don't feel like it right now. This is where I sleep. You sleep over there. I'm supposed to be here with a sheep and a donkey? She can't be serious. Is that all? We turned the entire kingdom upside down. The peasants are leaving their homes. And cooks keep complaining that they can't cook without salt. And the men-at-arms, they plunder and plunder. At this rate the kingdom will end up in ruin. And me with it. You are all useless! No salt, no rubies. You are both useless. If we don't find salt, we're all doomed. Buchvald, have you changed your mind yet? It's just a cave. There must be another entrance other than the hole in the ground. What do you say? Can we make an agreement? You know what, Oplan? Even if there was another entrance to the cave, if there really was one, you are… the last person in the world I would share it with. No more food from now on. Only rotten bread and some water. We'll see who wins. You're gonna die, Buchvald! But before that, I will burn the forest down. Let everything that is alive burn to ashes. The trees and animals, including the wolf. Then you shall see that your stupid legend is just a joke. You are scared of one wolf? Watch this! Ready! Set! Fire! Why isn't it burning? Why isn't the damn forest burning? That has to be some sort of magic. Neither water nor fire can take away what you learn. What have you learned today, Oplan? That no weapon can defeat the wolf? The gate! What are you staring at, dummies? You won't be laughing too long! I'm not finished with that animal yet! I don't even know if it is day or night. It's nighttime. How do you know that? Okay, daytime then. Be careful. The wound is infected. But don't worry. I found knotweed and chamomile. Even yarrow plant. When you work with tools all day, injuries happen. How am I gonna get out from here? Stop moving or you will hurt yourself. I'm not going to ask twice. You can ask a hundred times. It won't make you any smarter. Do you know who you're talking to? If I didn't know who you were and what you did, I would never-- Never what? This bird has no sign of an arrow or a trap. Do you hear me? Hot soup will make you feel better. Hurry up then. I'm starving. And don't burn it. Maybe you are okay with eating burnt bones. But not the prince. You only care about yourself. I'm not your servant. You're not getting anything until you apologize. Apologize? Me? Not happening! Come back. Finish the soup. Listen to me, Cyril. A good man, even if he's just a servant, is truly free. But an evil man… an evil man, even if he's a king himself, is just a servant to his hate. Do you understand what I am telling you? Open your eyes, or you won't see anything. Father. I will save you. Just like you saved me. You're not gonna die. You can't. You're on fire. Forgive me. Forgive me. The wound is infected. Lie down. Lie down. -Forgive me. -You'll tell me later. You saved me. If I am the king one day, everything is going to belong to me. Cyril! Where are you? A good king knows that the kingdom doesn't belong to him. But he belongs to the kingdom. Being a king is a service. Not a privilege. Remember, you are brothers. How did you get inside? It was open. No way. I locked the door. Are you accusing me of entering through the window because it was raining, and I would get soaked outside? Yes. See how you act? I used my own body to shield a donkey and a sheep. Just to save these eggs. So we can eat them for breakfast with cheese and bread. And salt. We'll put the water in mangers. The sun will evaporate the water and leave the salt behind. Just like in a cooking pot. You'll see. The only thing we need is the sun… and a warm wind. Can you stop lecturing me? Who can take this? Hammer it down properly. And stop giving me orders. Let me do it. Like this, okay? All you need to say is: "I humbly thank you, my lord." And what else would you want? A kiss? I'd rather kiss a frog. I will remind you of that one day. Hey, Buchvald. Can you hear me? It's me, Victor. Hey! Catch. I don't believe Oplan that the princes are dead. And I'm not letting you die either. I can't do this anymore. Let's go. It'll get dark soon. I pulled the arrow out, and the herbs helped you heal. But the water is the true miracle. Slowly. You'll see that the wound will heal now. It burns. But that's good. Do you think it will help me? Of course. It's salty. Everything around here is salt. People can't live without salt. It's our kingdom's wealth. And ours too. Who taught you all of this? I don't mean just the the healing the cooking and-- and all that. You know your way around here. You know the cave well. Your brother? Your father? -Your boyfriend? -My father. What happened to him? He did nothing. It's all my fault. My father was a salt miner in here. He was the best. He knew every corner of the cave. Even the king liked him. He used to tell him, "Buchvald, you're the only one who knows the heart of the cave." And what about your father? He died. I just didn't want my brother to become the king. Berta said, "The one who kills the wolf will become the new king." I need to heal myself. It must be me. I have to kill the wolf. Lena, wait. Why are you leaving? Lena. I saved your life. From now on, you're on your own. Come back. Please! I can get us out of here, I swear. Even if I had to kill the wolf with my bare hands! She created all that evil! It's all her fault! No one can kill the damn wolf for me. I'll run out of gold soon. While there's all this wealth below my feet. Ruby hall. What are you waiting for, Oplan? Shake the life out of Buchvald! Do whatever it takes. I need those rubies! My lord. Buchvald! Are you still alive? What is going on with my daughter? Tell me, Buchvald. Is there another entrance to the cave? The queen can have her rubies. And the villagers can have their salt. Get out. From now on, give him only rain water. I will buy salt! Can you hear me? Who has any salt? I'll pay in gold. I've crossed mountains and valleys, sailed across all the seas. I saw magic like no one else. The greatest miracle of them all is the black powder. Magical black dust. Step aside. Please, step aside. Even further. Incredible! Hey! You! What is this supposed to mean? Music and theater. Dancing and singing. Tricks and illusions on the spot. Yellow and red stars, disappearing rings, ribbons and rabbits. And paper and silk roses. Ooh la la! And coins from fool's gold. What do you have in there? Some sort of magic? Only black powder. I can see it's a powder. I can also see it's black. It can put a smile on your face. And put the stars in the sky. Thousands of them. All kinds of colors. Green. Pink. Orange and red. Bunch of nonsense! Guards! Arrest him! I didn't do anything. I swear. It's not my fault. It's a weapon. Terrible weapon. Wait! What did you say? The one who controls it, will have the world on its knees, sir. Well, well, well. You're coming with me! Move! He knows a magic trick that can disintegrate a rock. A magic trick? For real. Show it to the queen. I know how to create a weapon. One the world has never seen before. And if the black powder comes into contact with fire, it burns and explodes. Can it destroy a rock? We need bronze for that. The directions are the same as when you cast a bell. Except we will not be casting a bell, but a long pipe. And then we need to cast balls. And then? And then? Then you hope that it works, comedian. That statue of the old king. We have no use for it. First you must put the powder inside. Put it in. But how much, Captain? How much? -Just a little. -Just a little. -This much? -This much? A bit more. -More. -More. More! More! Enough. And now what? And now-- now the ball. Now the ball. Ball. Step aside. What's next? Now? Now the fire, and we shall see. He has nothing else to offer. To make sure the secret of black powder is well hidden, execute him. -Take him! -But why? No! Why? And we will set out once night falls. Have mercy! You lied to me! The one who kills the wolf will become the king! You will have your rubies, and I will have my crown. Good heavens. This must be the heart of the cave. I would trade all the rubies in the world for sunlight. This must be the way out. Lena! And where to now? Hey! Where is she? Let me out! Let me out! Can anybody hear me? Can you hear me, Buchvald? What was that? The cave is crying for its ruby. That's the wolf's howling, Buchvald. It's crying. Because it has a wound in its heart. Every wound needs to heal. But don't be afraid. The one who's never been hurt, will never know how to heal. Do you think it's a good idea? To bring all the salt to the castle? Do you have a better idea? I'll exchange it for my father. Don't frown. What can happen to me? Everything. You don't know Berta. And you do? What happens after you save your father? I will teach the people how to extract salt from the water. Everyone will be happy. -And I will find my sister. -Just one more thing, and it's done. What do you have? An arrow. I shot it at the wolf, but my brother got in the way. He fell off the cliff right into the Black Lake. I thought he was dead. This could be a different arrow. How do you know this one is yours? Because all my arrows are marked. You see? But how did it get inside this salt? Must have come from the cave. The water is salty because it comes from the cave. As it flows, it dissolves the salt. Do you understand? My brother and the wolf disappeared in the Black Lake. But the wolf keeps roaming the forest, and the arrow came from the cave. But how is that possible? Where are you, Cyril? It's true, your Majesty. She brought salt. Real salt. It's yours. I want nothing for it. Just my father. You can release him now, right? Look how much salt I brought. I will show you how to do it. It's not difficult at all. If it wasn't for you and your sister, everything could have been different. You really thought I would exchange Buchvald for a bag of salt? For two. Two bags of salt and a donkey. -Not the donkey. -Too late. I don't need your salt. But we could use the donkey. But to show you my mercy… I will let you say goodbye. For the last time. Unlock the door. -Father. -Ada. Father! Forgive me. Forgive me, I couldn't do it. Listen to me, Ada. The ruby. Does she have it? Does she still have it? She doesn't care about the salt or anything. She only cares about the rubies. It was all just a waste of time. So much work, if you could only see, Father. No, listen to me. Berta has some sort of weapon. There is nothing standing in her way anymore. All is lost, Father. You and Lena. Listen to me, Ada! That's enough! -Father! -Ada! Once the wound inside the cave's heart heals-- Can you hear me, Ada? The curse will be broken. Everything will go back to the way it was! Ada! Get lost! Get out of here! -Is that you? -Were you expecting someone else? I've never been happier to see anyone else. Quiet. Quiet. You are still hiding, even here? Everywhere. Let's go. You were right. Where is your father? That was the plan, no? He's going to lose his head in the morning. We'll think of something. Don't cry. We really must go now. Follow me and try not to look suspicious. Make sure nobody notices us. Zach? You're alive? Buchvald is not going to die. A rightful king has to make that decision. I took them. Our swords. You thought I was dead? Cyril and I? I thought all kinds of things. But I'm here. And Cyril is also alive. Victor, I know I'm not my father. But I'll fix what is broken. Because you are alive, Prince Zach. Berta is no longer a queen. I'm giving you your sword back. As well as my loyalty. You are a prince? You are a real prince? -Run. -Wait! Oh, come on. You wouldn't believe me anyways. You would think I was a liar and a crook. But you are a liar and a crook. If Oplan finds out that I'm near, that's the end of me. So don't get angry. Does it even matter right now? Was it here? Where was the wolf until now? She couldn't have appeared out of nowhere. Something must have happened. I think it's because of Lena. Because of my sister, you know? -She-- -Your sister? She shouldn't have taken the ruby out of the cave. So a girl disappeared, and a she-wolf appeared? The lake is the entrance to the cave. Come on. Come. But still, what if we are wrong? Then I'll just go for a little swim. Are you not scared? Tremendously. I'll count. One, two… The wolf appeared when Lena disappeared. Zach. I know what my father was trying to tell me. If the wound inside the cave's heart heals, everything will get back to normal. Zach. Everything will get back to normal! Zach. Zach! If the wound heals, if the ruby is returned… Did you there are two types of villagers? Useful ones and the useless ones. I don't need you anymore, Buchvald. I have a weapon that can destroy even a rock. Tomorrow, all the rubies will be mine. I will buy whatever I want with them. Salt. Weapons. Love. Even love can be bought. Both of you are going to die tomorrow. Let's go! Carefully. Heal the wound inside the heart of the cave. Cyril! Cyril! Are you in here? Cyril, talk to me! Cyril! Cyril! Cyril! Everything that you see is salt. You're different. So are you. -I wanted to-- -I wanted to-- -I'm sorry. -I'm sorry. What are you doing in here? I jumped in the lake. Just like you. Why? To save you. But I don't need to be saved. There's something you don't know. Follow me. It took me a while, but I understand now. If someone takes a ruby from the cave, they will turn into a wolf. A she-wolf, to be exact. The girl is the she-wolf. She saved me. She healed me, fed me, hunted animals, so I could eat. I cannot leave her. I can't leave her, because… because I can't live without her. We need to hurry to save her father. Nobody can get out of the cave, except Lena. Look. This is the ruby. The hand. The circle. These are the scales. Balance. Decision. A key. A lock. It's locked. A wolf. Arrows. That's the way. The sun. A way to freedom. A ruby, a way, the key. Make a decision. -Return it. -Return it. The cave is yours, My Highness. You don't want me to enter? Kill the wolf! Get the canyon ready! No! Lena. Please. Let her enter the cave. Let her do it. Let her be. Let her get in. If she wants the rubies, let her have them. Let her get in. Lena, let her get in. Please. But there is no entrance! Your crown, Your Highness. The ruby. The ruby from the heart of the cave is the key. I don't need anyone. You will get me there. Show me the heart of the cave. My rubies! They're all mine! -She changed. -It's a miracle! Ada. Lena. She was the wolf! A she-wolf. The one who kills the wolf will become the king. What are you waiting for? Shoot! She's a witch. Hurry up! -But-- -Shoot! -But, Captain-- -Shoot! What have you done? I only had one bag of black powder. This much. They spent most of it when they shot the king's statue. And the rest is really useless. Mine! Mine! Do you hear that? Oh, no. Berta. Are you looking for something, Berta? Need any help? Oh, how sweet. A family reunion. It's over. You are no queen. I don't need your stupid throne. I got the rubies. I'm richer than your entire kingdom. I don't need anybody! Get her! Berta, stop! Wait! You can't take them, trust me! Those rubies are cursed. Do you hear me? The legend is real, Berta! Zach, this way! A wolf! A black wolf! The one who kills the wolf will become the king! It's gonna be me! Me! It's gonna be me! I'll be the king! Ever since, nobody has seen Oplan or the stepmother. It's been said, they're wandering the world. Destined for one another. Are you sure? Totally. Let's return it together. This is the last bucket of water I'm helping you with. Promise? Or you'd rather kiss a frog? Can you just kiss me? Catch me! Merry Christmas. Look who's here. Our prince! The prince! Come here! What can I do with you? Go ahead. I'm starting to get used to how long everything takes you. But then it's really worth it. Both girls ruled the kingdom together. Because two heads are smarter than one. They stood by their husbands' sides. Happily ever after.
