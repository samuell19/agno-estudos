Subtitles by Nostromo I pulled that a bit You've gone rather near the cliff It's got to the edge Oh,Francis be careful Good job I have a head for heights Mr Templar,Sir Mr Keylin is on the phone from London,Sir Johnny,what does he want? Mr Keylin Senior,Madame,I think they're wanting you back at the office,Sir I thank you,Baxter I'm sorry,darling,that's would happen It's no good,Templar, I can't afford to drop 40000 £ And drop it,I shall,if I can't pull out before it's too late But,Keylin,it's only ten days until the American deal goes through if you only give me time It's no use,Francis -Oh,Keylin -Mmm When you do pull out,I'll be glad if you take your son Johnny with you He seems to find the salary I pay him quite inadequate Johnny,what's he's been up to now? These cheques total nearly 2000 £ They're drawn on the firm's account with my signature But I don't remember signing them It was your son who took them to the bank and drew the money What are you going to do? Take them to the public prosecutor,of course Wait It'll bankrupt those at least to his creditors But you wouldn't do that What? Go bankrupt? If you withdraw your support I've no alternative But you know what I mean those cheques.. They mean five years inside for Johnny in all -But being a first time offender -But this is black mail This is fraud All right I'll give you 10 days more Thank you ,Keylin I'd never though it would have come to this I've sweated like a coolie in a rice swamp to build this business Don't think I'd let it go under now That'll be Francis,you'd better go, Johnny,he's coming home early tonight That means midnight,your husband is a machine not a man -I know I've worked for him -You wouldn't if you father had Had put me in the firm? So what? Francis depends on father just as you depend on little Johnny Hello,yes Francis you promised to I know but you said All right,good bye Don't tell me he's been detained a bit You're always right,aren't you,Johnny? Invariably when it concerns you,my sweet Try not to look so dramatic,darling How about a night in the town,eh? Let's have a bit of fun Pardon me,Mum,shall I lay for three? No,Helen,for one,Mr Templar won't be home -Mr Keylin is just leaving -Very good,Mum Thank you for the charming invitation Well,think of me over your lonely casserole Do you realize if I hadn't played ball with Templar You've been sewing mailbags for the next five years Yes,father Then stop being such a damned little fool,Johnny Yes,father Remember this Johnny I'm not pulling your chestnuts out of the fire again No,father Sanctimonious old.. Lucienne? I changed my mind about coming up A woman's prerogative,my love You're too loyal,my sweet,for months now he hasn't cared anything about you wherewith,what's you're doing That's not life for you,darling One who is a stupid little woman who sits home and waits Besides you may not even have a home to waiting pretty soon Rumours has it,that Francis made a paying a shilling in the pound unless he Johnny I'm terribly tired, I think I'll go home I beg you pardon,Mr Templar I thought the light to be lit on accidental I didn't know you were working late It's quite all right,I was going anyway Quite so,Sir Hello darling,you shouldn't have waited up I didn't wait up.I've only just got back Good party? Not towards the end -Keep me company? -No thanks -Francis -Yes -I must talk to you -What about? About us,we might as well be strangers It's only for a little while longer,darling When this deal goes through Is it true that you're on the verge of bankruptcy? Who the devil told you that? Gossip gets around I didn't know you moved in financial circles Oh don't think I can If the whole business crash tomorrow and you had to start all over again At least it would be better than this You think so,do you? I don't share your opinion Darling,I didn't mean that And yet,10 years ago when you were starting At least you used to talk to me I thought,perhaps I helped you Lucienne Don't you see? No one can help me now except myself Don't you worry,let me do that,that's what I am for There isn't going to be any crash,not if I can help it Good night,darling Good night Helen Mr Templar had to leave early,Madame I think he had a call from the office -Did he leave any message? -No,Madame I'm sorry,Mr Templar, but the answer is still no If you feel that way,it's not for me to tell you where your best interest lay You put up a mighty good bluff,Sir As a poker player I respect you but business isn't poker And don't ever let anybody tell you different I won't Mr Templar,you're a good loser Thank you Yes,Sir? Miss Norton,order me a car at once,please will you Johnny,I don't know what to do Nothing seems to make sense any more I must get away for a while I'll take you away,we can go abroad -Wait here -Yes,Sir Johnny,I got to be by myself to think things out Go in there now and I'll see who it is -Francis,come in -Thank you,Johnny Unlike you to honour my humble abode I wouldn't call it humble,Johnny It must have cost you a pretty penny I'm sure you didn't come here to discuss my father's generosity In a way I did,Johnny Really? What way then? These cheques Look,I've already put up half an hour's yawn on that subject You might have to put up with jail,Johnny What do you mean? Unless you can persuade your father to help me out So the American deal flopped after all,eh? Yes It's no good coming to me you know how much influence I've got of the old so and so I suggest you tackle him yourself. I don't think he'll get you very far All right,Johnny,you win Black mail is not really in my line You mind if I use your telephone? -Go ahead -Thank you Hello,Helen Mrs Templar there? No message Johnny,do something for me,will you? Telephone Lucienne when she gets back and tell her I had to leave for America America? Of course,I'd be delighted Maybe one thing left to try Tell her I couldn't wait to say good bye How long will you be away? A week at least But if I pull something off if it takes a month -Johnny -I thought we had it that time What did he mean about prison? Surely if it ever happened.. Prison? Nobody said anything about prison,you must have misheard There is nothing to worry about He's leaving for America right away,didn't you hear him? Tell Lucienne I couldn't wait to say good bye Didn't suspect a thing I know That's just did it Johnny You go on in,I'll go up to the house and see Baxter According to plan? Good evening,Baxter Good evening,Sir,Madame's telegram arrived this afternoon,Sir And the lodge is all ready for you Would you like me to come over there now? Oh,no,thanks you very much Baxter,I can manage all right Mrs Templar is staying with her sister in Lillybrook,isn't she? That's right,Sir I'll expect she'll be over tomorrow just for the day Yes,Sir BTW,Sir,the door the lodge,just been painted and it may not be quite dry yet so if you wouldn't mind Thanks for telling me,I'll be careful -Happy? -Terribly We got four more days Four more days Good work Francis, I'd never thought you'd do it Neither did I Miss Norton Get my wife on the phone will you,please I always had faith in your business Keylin,I'm arranging for your 40000 £ to be paid immediately No hurry,my dear,why the hurry? It's those cheques of Johnny I was worried about He'll get them back,he would have anyway,I'm debiting you Of course,of course Mrs Templar has gone down to Devon,Sir Well,all the better,send her a telegram and tell her I'll be on the next train, get me a taxi,please,will you There you are my love,all for you Darling -Mr Templar,Sir -Hello,Baxter -Surprised? -And pleased,if I may say so,Sir Mrs Templar is in the drawing room,Sir So I hear Hello,Johnny But Francis I thought you were not.. I see you kept the papers for me Thank you,Lucienne Why the devilry hush? Didn't you get my wire? -No,we didn't expect you until next.. -I send it from the office this afternoon Then it was probably forwarded to Lillybrook I'm staying there,you see,with Millicent -And you,Johnny? -Me? I am at the lodge How very odd Why not in the house? -Well.I've.. -Surely,that's obvious,darling Since you're staying at Lillybrook I don't see why it should be obvious still -When did you come here,Johnny? -Tuesday night As soon as I went away How very prompt of you So you've been coming over from Lillybrook everyday then? -Yes,I thought that while Johnny -Don't think I blame you Millicent is pretty dull at the best of times BTW we'd better ring up and see if she's got my wire there What does it matter,darling I mean now that you're here I wasn't going to the phone,Lucienne What made you think I was? Francis,I didn't expect you back so soon -Otherwise -The American don't believe in wasting time Astonishingly efficient too Even managed to keep the trains clean which is more than they do over here I must have a wash Darling,what about the deal? -Did you manage to pull it off? -Certainly You can tell your financial friends that the threat of Carey Street is permanently removed Johnny,we got to warn,Millicent Oh,we can't phone from here I know,bur there's still time for you to get down to the village quickly Are you going back what we said? No,but I got to tell him in my own good time -Please,hurry,Johnny -All right Johnny got out? He's gone to the village He run out of tobacco Didn't know he ever smoked a pipe Look,Millicent,you got to help us He thinks Lucienne has been staying with you What? Since last Tuesday Now for Christopher's sake get this clear You are going back to Lillybrook tonight then? Yes I shan't now,of course Naturally not -Johnny would run you over? -I suppose so And then come back to lodge? Why couldn't Millicent put him up too? He preferred to stay here Driving you back and forth each day? Yes You ought to get him a job as your personal chauffeur What are you getting at? He'll be looking for a job soon -Anyone come to dinner? -No Then why don't we get Millicent to ring and ask her to come over to make four of bridge Johnny can bring her over,shall I ring her? No,she went over to Sidmouth Pity -Oh,hello,Johnny,have a filler? -No thanks,cigarettes for me I told you Johnny didn't smoke pipe Yes Hello,Millicent How clever of you to recognize my voice A telegram? Oh yes,that's all, the one I sent to Lucienne Announcing my arrival Sure,see you soon Thank you for ringing She must have got back from Sidmouth Apparently Funny how she recognized my voice -You should have a bit more sense -How was I to know,Mr Baxter Madame was supposed to be staying at Lillybrook so naturally I told the telegraph boy to send it What did he mean when he said you'd be looking for a job? I suppose I'd better tell you before he does There's some cheques of mine -Dad's? -Worse I'm afraid Oh Johnny not forged Yes,in his name too Oh my God Well,I was in a spot I had to find the money somehow But there must have been another way There wasn't I tell you,I tried them all Even Suicide Only I hadn't got the nerve Those tablets in your dressing case Yes,narconotin,I got them abroad Two of those,and curtains Might be an idea now all the same Think of the morning papers Promising young life cut short Oh,shut up,Johnny,I won't let you talking like this Getting your good stock in for the winter,Baxter I'm cutting a bit more than last year,Sir I'm not taking any chances One shouldn't take chances unless one's prepared to face the consequences The lodge is looking very smart When did you start painting it? Monday,Sir,just before young Mr Keylin arrived,Sir I suppose it'll dry pretty quickly in this weather About 48 hours so at the outside,Sir Oh,it's you,where the devil have you been? -Down to the lodge -The lodge? What on earth why did you go there with him watching every move we make? -I had to risk that -But why? Why? My God What are you doing with those? I found them in your case, they are the tablets -Give them to me,Lucienne -No -Give them to me -No-Give them Lucienne I want you alive,Johnny, it's all that matters to me Oh,I'm sorry,darling Then we are going to live to this last week Care what you are doing He mustn't find out till you've been cleared Helen Yes,Sir Whose raincoat is this? Mrs Templar's,Sir There's a smear of paint in the sleeve,have it cleaned,will you? -Yes,Sir -Not now -Later -Yes,Sir -Is he still out there? -Yes Then it is much more,I can't Pull yourself together, Johnny,he's not certain He just hoping that one of us will break -We've got to hold on until -Until what? There's bound to be some way I didn't hear him come in Quiet,Johnny,he'll hear you Lucienne You forgot to have this cleaned Then you do know I do now when you have told me What are you going to do? I've already done one thing, I've sent away the servants According to the book I have three alternatives To kill you,Johnny Or you,Lucienne Or to kill you both and then myself That I admit appeals to my sense of thoroughness You'd never dare Wouldn't I,Johnny? What do you suggest? Any ideas? Lucienne? No ideas Pity Any suggestion would help How long has this been going on,BTW? Since you went to America As soon as I was out of the way in fact No,as soon as I knew I couldn't live with you any longer Pity you had to decide that in my absence Though no doubt Johnny helped you reach a decision It wasn't Johnny's fault,it was yours For a whole year you haven't cared what happened to me And now your pride is hurt Because in a moment of spare I'm not available You never loved me or anything for that matter but money and the power that money can give you A week ago you could have prevented this But you were too busy saving your own skin And now it is too late and I'm glad You hear me,glad I hear you Then what about it? I shan't divorce Lucienne if that's what you mean Why not? I can take care of her I don't think you'd be at liberty to take care of anyone,Johnny The cheques.Remember? Francis you wouldn't do it? No brandy,I see I think I like some brandy,Lucienne Would you mind? Would you mind? -Excuse me,Madame -What are you doing here? I thought you had the night off -I forgot your coat,Madame,Mr Templar said -Never mind now -The morning will do -Yes,Madame I could do with a spot myself,come to that -Brandy? -Thank you Stone walls do not a prison make,no iron bars a cage(Lovelace) -Johnny -Yes What the devil Get out Get out and stay out Oh,Helen tell Baxter I want a taxi,will you? Yes,Madame Going away? Up to town for a few days Then abroad I expect I see,I left a letter for Johnny in the bureau Would you be kind enough to see he gets it I don't suppose I'll ever be seeing Johnny again Then You might as well Tear it up -Francis -Yes? Nothing Good bye Lucienne Good bye The taxi is at the door,Madame Cancel it will you,I'm waiting until Mr Templar gets back Yes,Madame Francis -Francis? -Mrs Templar Yes It's my duty to inform you there has been an accident Dr Silverton All right,Mrs Templar, if you just wait downstairs -Nurse,go and phone Sir Hammond will you -Yes,doctor Well,we are out of the wood now,Mrs Templar -Is he conscious? -Yes Nothing much to talk of Still I think it'll be safe for you to go up and see him for a moment will do I can't,I'm frightened Nonsense,there's nothing to be frightened of He stands an excellent chance of recovery now It's not that What is it then? You wouldn't understand Perhaps not One thing I do know You saved your husband's life And he wants to see you Are you sure,Sir Hammond? Of course I'm sure Come on,up you go and no talking about it Mrs Templar Well Did he speak at all? No But I think he's told me all I want to know There you are,Mrs Templar You're leaving,Sir Hammond? Nothing more I can do It's up to you now Is it safe for him to talk? In moderation,yes He's had an excellent night's rest But I'm afraid you'll have to prepare yourself For what? His fall caused what we call A retrograde amnesia In his case He has no recollection of the four days immediately proceeding his accident And it's improbable that his memory of them will ever return Then he He doesn't know Oh my God That's worrying I shouldn't let it worry you,Mrs Templar After all,four days is a very short space of time And you will be able to fill in the blanks for him That's just what I dare not do Why not? Because the night before his accident I tried to murder him Now tell me Just how did it happen There was some tablets I took them from a friend of mine And your husband found out in time? Your case isn't so very uncommon,Mrs Templar After all you happened to have the means of killing ready to hand Which is fortunately rare Otherwise many of us might be murderers I can remember many years ago It was a student's dance We were almost inseparable at the time The other fellow and I But we've been drinking And the usual of a very pretty girl Candlestick nearby Luckily I've got a very fixed skull otherwise I wouldn't be talking to you now He left a scar of course We are still best of friends This is different -You know why -Yes,I think I do You thought that you weren't in love with your husband You wanted him out of the way Now you found that you love him after all I do love him Of course you do,you've proved that These last few days But I'm afraid that you must go through the rest of your life without ever let him know what happened that night But I got to let him know, don't you see that? It wouldn't be fair to him otherwise I couldn't live with him unless That fall of his It wasn't an accident,was it? No Then it's your duty to see that he never remembers otherwise the same thing might happen again I shall go up to him now, he's been asking about you Thanks Take him some of those flowers while you are about it I must have dozed off directly I got in the plane coming back Do you know I hadn't had a wink of sleep for nights After that I don't remember a thing until I came to and found you sitting beside me You mustn't worry about it,darling You know what Stubbs said Still I give anything to remember that moment When I walked in and told you the deal had come off after all Yes You do realize It was not only the business,darling I wanted to do it for you I realize it now Not then? I wasn't sure Johnny Keylin was here that night,wasn't he? Yes What became of him? He left before the accident Did I say anything to him about Some cheques You tore them up Oh,good,I was worrying in case they've gone into the wrong hands You know it's an extraordinary thing as I have such horrible feeling of guilt -You? -Yes Like I used to have when I was younger and I woke up after a blind Only then there was usually some really tangible reminder Policeman's helmet in the bed post A bust of Disraeli in the bathroom But there's nothing Complete blank If only I could remember Go on Funny thing I can't get that tune out of my head Oh,damned old Stubbs,I'm going to have a brandy that kills me Join me,dear? Not now,thanks BTW what happened to the Regency decanter Do you know? The brandy looks like closer to sherry in this thing -Oh,Helen -Yes,Sir What happened to the decanter we used to keep the brandy in? It got,it got broken,Sir While I was away? Yes,Sir -Morning Helen -Good morning,Sir It's a pleasure to see you getting about again Thank you,Helen -I see they painted the lodge -Yes,Sir Was that before I went away? Just before young Mr Keylin arrived,Sir Mr Oh,yes -Stayed at the lodge,didn't he? -Yes,Sir Mind you,Helen you've no idea how annoying it is to go by with a piece missing of one's mind Helen Have you done any talking with Mr Templar? We have a few words every now and when,what's the matter,jealous? Nannie,not larky now Mr Templar lost his memory,you see and there's not our job to help him to find it,you understand that now? -Yes,Mr Baxter -Bear it in mind then Lucienne you'd better put on your mac,it's pretty chilly outside All right darling Still that paint on the sleeve I thought I told Helen to have it cleaned Francis you You can't remember that What do you mean,dear? It was on the day you came back The day I came ba.. Then my memory is returning Lucienne What's the matter? I don't think I'll go out after all Nonsense,darling,a breath of fresh air would do us both good I'd rather not if you don't mind All right,I won't be long, just to the cliffs and back Hello,yes Could I speak to Sir Hammond Stubbs,please,it's urgent Tell him it's Mrs Templar What can I do? It'll all come back to him, I know it,everything he says and does Who was that on the phone there? Oh,nothing,wrong number Lucienne I am not going to spend any more time trying to remember Oh,darling,I'm so glad It wasn't good for you, it wasn't good for either of us You'd have told me,wouldn't you, had it been anything important? There was nothing that's important to us now Nothing that can ever come between us again So embezzlement wasn't enough You know,chose among your rather unsavoury pastimes to embroil yourself with other people's wives Are you going on much longer,father? Get out,get out and don't you dare come back to me until you can prove you are on yourself on honest living All right And you can be sure of one thing One side step out of this room,father one of us is going to feel very sorry about this and it won't be me Lucienne I'm just going down to the post All right,darling,don't be long I won't,bye Hello Johnny Aren't you glad to see me, I have had warmer welcomes What are you doing here? Darling,I am in a bit of trouble, I am afraid,you are going to help me out I can't help you out Johnny,you must get out of here before Francis comes back Oh,yes,Francis,how is the old boy? I read all about his fall in the papers City man narrow escape from death Lucky toll those cheques wasn't it? Look,Lucienne,I need money and I need it quickly Father's got tough,I'm in a hell of a spot I'm not interested in your personal affairs Aren't you since when? Oh come on darling What's the good of pretending, you love me and I love you -That's why I couldn't stay away -I never loved you,Johnny You were saying you love Francis next That's exactly what I do say Really darling Women are the Masters or should I say Mistresses of self deception Just because you find it easier to revert back to the ever loving wife stuff You manage to persuade yourself I love Francis and I don't care whether you believe it or not Now get out of here Even if you do love him do you really imagine he's ever going to forget -He has forgotten -And forgiven? He doesn't have to forgive he doesn't know.. He doesn't know? What do you mean he doesn't? Doesn't he know you tried to kill him? Doesn't know about us? God,what a break So you won't help me,eh? I think you will What are you getting at? You wouldn't like me to Chime his memory for him would you? Johnny,you wouldn't -Not if you are a good girl -What do you mean? What you are thinking don't flatter yourself No,I came here for one thing Money and now,you've made it so easy for me How much do you want? A ton as we blackmailer say A hundred?But I haven't got it I don't need it in cash,I've got enough to last me till the banks open A cheque will do me fine What's the matter? I've must have left my cheque book downstairs Well hurry up otherwise we might pop into Francis That would never do,would it? One look at me it might all come back to him Just make it up to the bearer,will you? You know this little table will remain one of my dearest memories To your lasting happiness,my love Here's your money Thank you,darling Well I must be on my way How about a little something to remember me by,eh? Don't say what you are doing here that's Lucienne's copy right I saw what you were doing Well,what's the kiss between friends? -Rather lot of money,Lucienne -Give me that Not until my wife explains why she should give you a hundred pounds It was a loan,Francis,Johnny needed it Was he paying interest by making love to you? Francis,you've got it all wrong I was in a hell of a spot and I asked Lucienne to help me there's nothing more to than that -That's the truth Wait a minute,this has something to do what I couldn't remember,hasn't it? Hasn't it? Answer me,damn you Don't tell him,Johnny I think he will Let me go,let me go All right,you asked for it You great blundering oaf too blind to see what was going on your very nose with your business and your trips to America -Johnny please What do you expect Lucienne to do,take up knitting? Go on,Johnny She did love me,so much so she tried to kill you here in this room with poisoned brandy it was I like a blowzy and pulled the glass out of your hand now do you remember? You've got to let me forgive you Because that'll mean that you've forgiven me There can be no forgiveness in your heart Those four days They'll always will be with you Four days What are four days in a lifetime?
