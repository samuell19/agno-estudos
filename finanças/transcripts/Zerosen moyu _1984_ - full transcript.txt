ZERO Action stations! Action stations! Pilots to meet for briefing at 05:30 hours. All together! Pilots to the planes! The prayers of the nation are with you all on your mission. Salute! Squadron ready? Synchronize watches! The time is now 06:00 plus 10. Ten seconds to go.' Five seconds! Stand by! Now... Forward! - Is the plane ready? - Yes, it's ready. - Everything is in good order. - Fine. - Good luck. - Thank you. Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! Stand by, chalks! - Stand by chalks, sir! - Stand by chalks! Ground crew clear! Contact! Good luck! Showa 15, 8th of December The first day of the Pacific War That day saw a new chapter written in the history of air warfare. The dawn of a brilliant new fighter plane, the “Zero", able to cross the China Sea and raid the American bases in the Philippines. Americans! Clark Field Airbase The American Air Force that had dominated the Pacific for so long... ...was destroyed in a day. Japan had won the battle for the air. Complete victory had been achieved through a combination of surprise... “ and thy superiority of the “Zero“ This new airplane fascinated us, and was the reason we had joined the Navy in the first piece. Mitsubishi 1MF The Navy, with its wealth of tradition, was a hard task master. Dreams of becoming a fighter pilot soon faded, as the young recruits were put through the rigor of military discipline. The strict code of the imperial Japanese Navy was drummed into them. Hey! You aren't thinking of deserting, are you? Are you afraid? They're bound to catch us! And they'll beat the hell out of us! Are you out of your mind? It isn't worth it! I want to stay alive! What kind of life is it? We're no better than cattle! Damn it! I'm no dumb animal! I'd rather die like a man, than live like that! I'm not going to take it anymore! I quit! I'm going home! Showa 3 Hold on! Where're you two rankings going to? What're your names? I'm Hamada Shoichi, sir. Imperial Naval College in Yokohama. Training week. I'm Mizushima Kunio, sir. Also from Yokohama... Fleet airmen... And you're both volunteers... And you're on leave, but you've lost your Way. I take it you'd like some directions... I'm captain Shimakawa. I have something interesting to show you. Come on! It's something you've never seen before... This is the... ...prototype of the new fighter plane that will transform Japanese air power. And since next year marks the 2,600th anniversary of the Empire, we've called the plane "The Zero", in honor of the Emperor. Take a look. The casing is made from a special alloy, duraluminium. It's quite unlike any other metal; it can resist great stress. It is equipped with an 1,000 horse power engine. The wheels... ...tucked back in. The first retractable undercarriage. It is fitted with twin synchronized machine-guns, firing 7.7mm bullets from either wing. The explosive impact of just one shell can blast an airplane out of the sky. No plane in the world is equipped with such formidable fire power. Climb in now! Sir! Feel good? Try the controls. Sir! Change! Sir! Come on, get down. Hamada... What does your father do for a living? He's a farmer, sir! - And yours? - He works in a factory, sir. I see... So if you two were to desert, it'd be to become a farmer and a worker. I know what you were doing down that road. You're proud of being Imperial Naval air cadets, but you can't take... ...being beaten. You resent what you feel is the brutal discipline of the Navy. You think the training officers are sadists; you just couldn't take any more. Now, look here“... You know what your salary is. A meager 5 yen... ...and 60 sen a month. This fighter plane cost every bit of... 55,000 yen. You'd have to work for 1,000 years, just to buy one airplane like the "Zero. " But, if you learn to be patient and you stick it out, in 2 more years the country will give you a "Zero", as a present! Not only that... ...a brand new model. And it won? cost you a single sen. Well, how about it? Don't you think it's a good deal? You'll never get another one like it. If you can stick it out, it'll be yours. You'll be lords of the skies! If you return to your training wing, I'll do everything in my power to help you Now, think it over. I'd just love to fly this plane over my town... We'd better get back. Come, Hamada! Let's stick with the training. We saw a bright future opening up in front of us. Hamada was a natural flier. He was the first to graduate. I didn't, so, instead, I was assigned to ground crew. Showa 15, April Hamada! Oh, Mizushima! Hey, you're sunburnt! And you're covered in grease! Captain Shimokawa is waiting to brief you. What?! The captain?! They need some extra maneuvers. He's going to do the test flight. We're flying "Zero"s every day... Why another test flight? One of the carrier "Zero"s crashed yesterday. They think it was a malfunction He's going up to repeat the identical maneuvers. Unlike the earlier models, this latest version of the "Zero"... ...has a balancing bar at the tip of each wing, making the plane much easier to handle and able to perform tighter turns in combat. However we're still having this fluttering effect which is what happened yesterday. Hello, captain.' I've finished training! Now I'm ready to fly anything. I've been assigned as a pilot to the Yokosuda squadron... ...as an ordinary flight lieutenant. Oh... Good to see you again! - Welcome back! Flown over your home yet? - Well... not yet. He's waiting till he can afford to buy some cushions so he's mother will be cozy. - Really?! - Because she'll be going with him too. Well, now... I'm being transferred out and given a full squadron. Your new chief is captain Kufukada... ...and I want you to show him as much as you've shown me. We pilots must stick together. - Life's so short... - Yes! Thank you, captain! Oh, Mizushima... Have a drink with him. Thank you, sir. Altitude: 2,500. Speed; 260 knots. 1,800 rpm. So far, everything is in order. From 3,000 feet I'm ready for descent. Speed; 350 knots There's a slight fluttering on the right wing. I'm continuing with the manoeuver.. Shimokawa! Don't push your luck too far! Come back! Speed 380! There still is a fluttering on the right wing. Now H! execute a sudden dive. That's enough! Come down! The plane won't take it! Stop it! You're crazy! The research scientists poured over the design, looking for what caused the accident. wind-tunnel room, Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal 320. Horikoshi Shiro, chief planning officer, Nagoya Aircraft Manufacturing Plant 330. 340. Sons Yoshitoshi, assistant officer 350. 360. 370. The Wing's twisting! And fluttering badly! 380. An excellent speed, sir. Shimokawa's plane crashed about 300 meters out to sea. You've murdered the captain! His blood is on your hands! You designed coffins, not airplanes! You murder pilots, you damn murderers! I'll never forgive you! Get away! You, bastard! Shut up! This men... ...who have designed the "Zero"... ...the plane we are so proud of... ...deserve our respect and our gratitude. The world used to laugh at the Japanese... ...for imitating others, but now, now we've designed something of our own... ...which is vastly superior to everything else. We owe our designers a great debt. Captain Shimakawa understood... ...how important was the job that we're doing. I'm truly sorry about his death. But the design called for as little weight as possible. Even the wings had the balancing wings removed to reduce weight... But we ignored what happened in vibration. I'm sorry we had to find it out the hard way and... I personally accept the blame... ...for the pilots' death. We know there're defects. But we must fly, we can't wait until it's perfect. I didn't know about your work. I apologize for my bad manners. Forgive me! Will you join us? - We can drink to his memory. - Right. Cheers. Hamada and Mizushima became airmen thanks to the captain. And there're many many other young men eager to follow them and join the ranks. The captain's death was in vain, I can promise you that. But we still have a long way to go to catch up with the Western countries. Their technology is still far superior to ours. If we ever do find ourselves in a war with America... ...We'll lose... ...unless we take advantage of surprise. Hawaii Pear Harbour Japan took on the might of the industrialized nations. It was a calculated risk. Success came quickly. From the Aleutians, to the North, the Solomons to the South, and Burma, to the West. the Japanese flag covered a vast area of the Pacific. Spitfire “Zen? faced a formidable foe. The 5-17 flying fortress... Bristling with armament and weaponry... AA this plane symbolized the industrial power of the United States. That is why it was called: “a fortress in the sky. “ It's crippled! - Hey, are you okay? - Yeah, I am okay. Just... a little shook up. Hamada reporting for duty, sir. I'm sorry I'm late, I got delayed... ...taking out a B-17. - Did you see it crash? - Yes. - I flew right into it, sir. - I'm not going to say well done. You're supposed to use your guns in combat... A collision with an enemy aircraft is a disgrace. - Be more careful. - Yes, sir. What happened? I don't know. I kept firing. Nothing seemed to penetrate it, like if the bullets bounced of... Come on, let's go find the wreckage. Where did it crash? Fragments of the 5-17 were found scattered for miles around. The first question that was answered... t' was the armouring that was used to protect the cockpit. The steel plate was 10mm thick. The B-17 was virtually impregnable to the “Zero“s 20mm bullets. Look... You see where they hit? The bullet marks are just scratches... They sure know how to protect their pilots... Emergency!! Crash crews to the runway! Emergency! It's been badly hit... Help him! By contrast, the “Zero“'s armour was paper thin. The lives of Japanese pilots were considered expendable. The fess of their skiff and experience was to prove costly as emerged at the crucial battle of Midway. Showa 16, June 5th Midway Battle Aircraft carriers Akagi, Kaga, Soryu] & Hiryu are sunk The imperial Japanese Navy lost many of its most brilliant pf lots. This was a blow from which Japan never recovered. I think we've had already ample evidence that air attack is the key to victory, Whether on land, or at sea, as at Midway, but we're not manufacturing enough planes. Since the war began, only 180 "Zero"s have been built; we must have many more... ...produced in shorter time! We also need a plane that is better armored than the "Zero" I would like to make a point myself. I might be so bold as to interject. The most important thing now are not planes. Pilots are! We're loosing too many of them. We need to protect our pilots more. Compared to the American planes, our armouring is virtually non-existent. No wonder we're losing so many men and planes! They're being killed at their controls... And they're being asked to fly airborne tincans! Do you realize one pilot requires over 1,000 hours of flight training, that takes place over a period of 3 to 4 years? - It's a waste! - Yes, we know! What do you suggest? That we build another plane by tomorrow? We have to protect our pilots! We can't just throw their lives away! We can stop treating them like so much front line infantry! That's enough! They aren't cannon fodder; we recognize the vital role they play. But they're soldiers like the rest of us. They've got to risk their lives if we are to win! If you're not careful, there won't be any left! Do you want us to ground all the planes?! It comes down to a question of design. Should the plane carry less fuel?? Or armouring? Less guns? For the time being, there is no alternative... ...to the 1,000 horsepower engine! One "Zero" is needed to take on 10 enemy planes... ...and we can't offload either guns or fuel! Attack remains our best weapon and defence! The Americans are too conscious of their own safety. They're not prepared to sacrifice their lives. But the Japanese are brave! We must attack, so we need the fuel to take us to the enemy! Nagoya I went back to Japan for the advanced mechanic training course. This could lead me to promotion. Did the chain come off? Yes, that's right. Oh... please... Let me have a look. - There we are. - That's most kind of you. Thank you... Take these, they're fresh. - They're not going to bite you. - I don't really think I should... Oh... what do you mean? You don't want them? I have nothing else to give you... Oh... I'll take them, then. I've got to visit somebody. The eggs will make a nice gift. - Here. - Thank you very much. I'm the one who should thank you. Sir, this is a specific request of my chief. He wants all parts, Wherever possible, standardized with the "Zero" These piston rings... they've been wearing of far to often. Do you think we can get replacements easily? No only the piston rings. I mean, the "Zero"s. As for the Americans, it's easy... All their parts are standardized. It's a matter of precision... Ah... it's simple. We should follow their example on this one It'd make a great difference. I realize; we'd all like it. Standardization's been on the books for years, but it's not easy getting the Army and Navy to agree... They have to be rivals... Politics... Mr. Sony... You've got a bottle of whiskey. Will you share it with us? Oh... Let's take a break. Allow me to introduce Mr. Mizushima. Mr. Tojo. - Hello. - The original designer of the "Zero" - Nice to meet you, sir. - Pleased to meet you too. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Will you take care of this, please? Oh... I'm sorry but we have no more sake left in this restaurant. - Better warm it up. - Yes, ma’am. Thank you. We used to come here; it was our favourite haunt. After it opened, we flew the first "Zero" overhead. - We named the restaurant after the plane. - Good evening, sir. If we drink here, We'll get very drunk. It's gonna be a long night. Yes... We had to transport that first "Zero" to the airstrip with an ox-cart. Conditions were that primitive... and we ourselves followed behind on bicycles... We pedaled all night... Couldn't lose sight of the ox-cart. Shizuko! Boil it! I fancy an egg I see... You keep hens here as Well. - What? - Oh, nothing. He's a pilot. He's just come back from the front line. He needs a bit of rest. He'll be all right then. You know what? I think I'd do anything for you; all you have to do is ask. Can I fix your bicycle? Not now. I'd really like to see a fighter plane. Haven't you seen one?! I though they showed you one at the factory. No... They haven't shown me anything. We never get to test our protection first hand. Her father used to be the senior foreman at the factory. He had an accident. He fell from a scaffold and broke his neck. I'm very sorry. She went to see a "Zero". Actually she got to its manoeuvers. One of the original "Zero"s her father made. She'd like nothing better than that! Oh, I see... We'll have to see what we can do about that... - Thanks'. - Uh'. Mizushima! It's pretty quick! It also is capable of a great variety of aerial manoeuvers. The pilots have just returned from the south islands. He's going back soon. He's an ace already. Thank you very much. I didn't expect to be so close to the airplanes. It's just like a dream! Hey, there! - Hello, there! - Hamada! Mizushima! How did you like this one? You're good! I've got some more tricks! He'll crash! - Delicious! - Oh, really? Are you sure? This is Hamada. He's a pilot with combat experience. - Pleased to meet you. - Miss Yoshikawa. I won't forget what I saw today! I'm so excited! Like a dream come true! Pilots are moody. They find it difficult to relate to other people. I'm sorry. Perhaps it's because they fly so high in the sky. Hamada's nice, a real gentleman. Hey, she cooked all these, you got to try some. Please try it! Maybe it's too sweet. You don't like my cooking? Thanks very much. Hey, did you hear what I said up there? Forget it. The Americans had a piece of luck. They managed to lay their hands on a “Zero'' completely intact... On a flight back from Dutch Harbour a “Zero“ had to make an emergency landing. Their designers went to work straight away. The American industry was constantly turning out new and more powerful fighters Added to which they were better armed and there were more of them. The odds against Japan were overwhelming... No! Watch out! Showa 16, 7th of August the US army lands on Guadalcanal The Solomon Sea became a graveyard for the god “Zero“. Day after day they fought back against the enemy's vastly superior numbers. Somehow, at the end of each day Hamada lived to tell the tale. He became one of the great combat aces. I have to return to Japan with immediate effect. They want you to take over. I'm sorry to see you go... Of course, your mission is vital to the nation. We must build better planes... ...than the Americans. We rely on our "Zero"s. - We'll lose the war... - The "Zero" once was king of the skies... ...now it's a has been... American forces landed at Guadalcanal. Island by island Japan was losing the war of the Pacific. She was retreating. Only Rabaul remained as a Japanese stronghold. Showa 17 Rabaul in April 1943 the Japanese Navy launched a massive counter offensive... ...under the direct command of one of Japan's most capable leaders.' commander-in-chief Yamamoto lsoroko. Guys, the commander-in-chief. Attention! The commander-in-chief f That's all right... At ease, men, at ease. It smells rather nice, what is it? Do'you mind if I join you? I'm a bit hungry... - Yes sir. You're Welcome, sir. - Please, all of you, sit down. It looks delicious. What is it, by the way? Well, it's only sea turtle, sir. We caught it while swimming. Sea turtle?! Never tasted a turtled before. - Live and learn... - It's very hot, sir... Delicious! Very tasty. Certainly better than the usual wooly beef we get. Vice-admiral Ukagi Matome, Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet Please, sir. Won't you reconsider dropping your inspection? I beg you, sir! I'll be perfectly safe, don't worry. If you insist, sir, but I think it's an unnecessary risk. I've set up an escort. We'll be on your wing every step of the way! Leave this to me! Please, reconsider, sir! No... Pilots are exhausted, they need all the sleep they can get. I don't want them to bother about one old man's safety. - Hamada, squadron leader. - Come in. Hamada. We're to act as the escort... ...to Yamamoto when he visits the front tomorrow. I shall be flying escort myself. I've told him to stay here, but we can't afford to leave him without air cover. I want lieutenant Warasaki in charge. Hamada, I'm relying on you to assist me in escort leader. In this very important mission I need all my top pilots. I want to go over the flight plan with you. Course, sir. Yes, sir! - Are you ready? - Yes, sir! Anytime! We have a very important special mission ahead of us. We are to act as fighter escort... for the commander-in-chief on his inspection at the front. - That's all. - Attention! Dismissed! "The 'Peacock' moved at the expected time, the tail was swung by the paper fan" "from : Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet" "to : Mark A. Mitscher, Commander of the Solomon Islands airbase" The Americans had cracked the Japanese naval code. After deciphering the radio traffic... AA it was a simple procedure to arrange an air ambush over Bougainville. Captain! At ease. Nobody said anything. You shouldn't hold yourself responsible. If anyone's to blame, it's me, the commander. You shouldn't Worry that you'll be held responsible. I'm the leader! I am responsible! There were no excuses to make at all! The only thing left for me is hara-kiri! f. Lieutenant, some of us survive, others die For the moment, that's enough. We're all still alive. We'll carry on the fight tomorrow. You're not at all ashamed you couldn't save him. We had to survive! The enemy is threatening the life of our nation! Our duty is to continue the struggle! Do you have anything else to say? You are right. You fought and lived to fight another day. The commander understands. I don't think there's anything more to be said. The Navy demands strict adherence to it's code! We gladly submit ourselves to it. We also recognize it's unlikely We'll ever see our homes again. Remember: the eyes of Japan are still upon us and we mustn't let her down! The escort leader and his men were assigned dangerous missions every day. And evidently, one by one, they did not return... They met their deaths honorably, fighting for their country, and by the code of the Japanese Navy. One of the wheels got jammed! Morisaki. .. Never give up. Captain... You're a leader... ...don't be in too much of a hurry to die. Try to share your grief with the rest of us. We'll all fight together. Your place is with your men. Yes. What shall we do with a drunken sailor... What shall we do with a drunken sailor... What shall we do with a drunken sailor... Captain, why don't you have a drink with us and do yourself a big favor?! - Lieutenant! - Yes! - Let's get drunk! We need some volunteers to steal some meat from the kitchen I'll go! I'll do it! Our target today is Guadalcanal. The Americans have a task force lying just off-shore about to attack. The mission is simple. Hit them before they hit us. The fighters will act as cover for the bombers The bombers must get in close for effective damage. We must see the bombers reach their targets. And once they've released their bombs... ...they get back to base. Under no circumstances... . are you to leave a bomber unescorted! Enemy fighters will be waiting like wolf packs for the kill. It won't be easy. We're in for a few casualties on this one. Just believe your particular number is not up yet and you'll be fine. That's all! Dismissed! Hamada!... You come with me. What for?! The bomber crew... They're afraid. They'll attack tomorrow. They need someone to cheer them up. Sir. This is lieutenant Hamada. You can be sure you won't die. You're in good hands. Just leave all the worrying to us. The "Zero" can beat anything! You can take my word for it! We'll be around to keep an eye on you. All right? Yes, sir! Ships! Got you! Don't give up! Don't give up! Father! Bail out! Hamada! You're staying put. The engine's leaking oil from the crankshaft. I've sent it in for repairs, unfortunately. You're on stand by. You'll have to stay down till we find an airplane that's air worthy. All right? What do you mean the crankshaft is leaking oil?! Were you lying to me? What's going on? Why? Take it easy. Don't be so keen to get yourself killed! The Navy doesn't care about his pilots. We don't you to die! You're one of the best. We all feel the same way! Can't stand by waiting... Watching wiping yourself out! If you're not careful... ...that "Zero" will become your coffin! I'm trying to help, not stopping you! But what hope have you got to survive? None at all! All I'm asking is that you stay grounded today! It's none of your goddamn business! The ground crew is in this war as Well, not only you! I kill Americans! That's the only thing I know how to do! And nobody, not even you, is going to stop me! Get the plane ready! I'm flying! Hamada didn't come back that day, just as I feared. Hurry! Bombers attack! There's a bomb! No, come back! Come back! Because of my injuries, I was ordered back to Japan, to recuperate. Hamada! Lucky devil! Congratulations. My God, you're alive! Of course, they can't kill me so easily. The Weather was miserable that day, low visibility. Couldn't return to base. I flew around, looking for somewhere to land. So many air raids! I was lucky to find somewhere. There is no need to cry. War makes fools of us all... since I'm still alive, I'm not going to waste the rest of my life I know I'm a good pilot, but I'm not going to let the Navy kill me. On the march! Eyes left! After my wound healed, I worked as a test pilot for major Kaputa ...at the Yokosuka air base. We learnt to be efficient inspectors. What makes you think these women can build airplanes? I'm impressed by your attitude, but I Worry about their products. Mizushima.' Shizuko! I'm so glad to see you! I've never thought we'd ever meet again! This war kills everybody! Well... I've got work to do. I'll see you later. No... I went to see the restaurant, but it was closed down. I thought you had got married Don't be silly. I can't do what I want anymore. Girls under 25 must work in factories. I don't mind it at all. Guess I'm kind of proud. I'm helping making the "Zero". Why not? You're following in your father's footsteps. Most of the girls are geisha but they work as hard as me. The "Zero" will smell of lipstick. I hope they know what they're doing. You're aware that the war is not going to well for us... When the enemy bombers start to get through, which will be soon, they'll come here, it'll be there main target. Why don't you marry, settle down, have children? How can I when all the young men are sent to the front to die... ...and I can't find a bridegroom. What about you? Will you stay in the Navy when the war's over? If I stay in I won't get a promotion. I'll be better of running a bicycle shop. What a good idea! A lovely new shop with rows and rows of brand new shinning bicycles... Sounds great! I think I'd like to work in that shop too... I'd better be going along now... Oh... The pilot Hamada gave me this silk scarf just before he went into action. I'm giving it to you. It'll keep you arm. Please take it! Are you sure? No, I can't! You might catch your death! Are you sure? You want me to? I'm grateful, thank you very much. Goodbye, I'll come again. Yes, don't you forget. Chalks, away! The Japanese airmen at Rabaul fought with great dedication and bravery AA and, eventually, the Americans catted oft their offensive in that sector. But the “Zero” had to ceed! the mastery in the air. The Americans had a new fighter: “The Corsair “F4U. It's powerful engine meant it could outclimb the “Zero", and when the “Zero” could no longer climb but had to tum back... AA then, the “The Corsair“ bided his time. It swooped down on the “Zero” from above and behind, the ideal attack direction. The “Zero” had little defence' In most cases such tactics favoured the Americans. But veteran pilots like Hamada still had a few tricks up their sleave. Hamada returned to Japan alive, something he thought would never happen. But he had been badly burnt... I'm back! Mother! Grandpa! Koji? Miki? Shoichi! I'm back, mother. I'm sorry I didn't visit you, son. But we've been busy bringing in the rice. We've had to do it all ourselves; labor’s scarce. How is everybody? Fine. Your grandpa's still healthy. Akio got drafted into a tank regiment, poor lad... Ishiro works in a factory. Toshio and Kumiko have left to work into ammunitions down by the docks. Miiki and Koji have been helping out in the paddy fields. I know it isn't much, mother... Are you still in the hospital? For a While... yes. Sorry I've been busy. I'd have comed to see you, son, but there're so many things to be done, it never seems to stop. Never mind. I can come and see you... And I prefer it this Way. Well, son, are you going to stay the night? No. I can't stay. There aren't many trains. I mustn't be late. I must be going back. I'll make you a bowl of rice when work's over. Why not rest a while? I'm all right, mother... Don't you worry. I'll send your brothers back to talk to you. They've got lots of questions. I suppose... ...they're bound to discharge you after what happened. Isn't that right? They won't make you fly again? Is that right? You can come back home. I can take good care of you at home. Let's see if I get out of hospital, first. Then, We'll see. I hope you'll come home. Hamada! Oh, you, Mitsu! You are looking Well. Oh... My hands. They look a lot better. They've told me to do this every day, until it hurts. They're testing next month, to see if I can use my hands again. What do you mean? To... fly planes?! Why not stay in Japan and be an instructor? If you return to the Navy... ...as a pilot... you will die. There was only one thing that could have made Hamada change his mind. Because next month he passed his medical tests. Hamada made a remarkable recovery. Great! That's wonderful! A pilot goes a little hare brained after a While. He's not even able to stand on a bicycle! He's lost all his coordination and control. Aren't you afraid when you are up there on your own? Of course! When I attack the enemy maybe he's even more afraid... ...than I am and then he runs away, which means I won and if he doesn't run, I fire my gun, ta-ta-ta, and he crashes! Great! So you keep on winning every time! Not every time... I lost in the end. Shizuko... ...could you buy some vegetables and cook them for us? What should I cook?! All right! If you really want me to, I'll use one of my special recipes on you. That's great! Well, it depends on what vegetables I can get from my friends. We'll see you later. All right! I gave her that silk scarf you gave me. Oh?! She specifically asked for it. I had to. You see... the poor girl has fallen in love with you. You're kidding! It's true! Anyway, there's nothing strange about it. Why don't you make her a happy woman? Become a flight instructor! Pass on your experience to the next generation. The "Zero" isn't everything... Understand? Be good to her! Right; if you're not ready now, another time. Shizuko! He's a good man, isn't he? Hamada')... Yes. I've told him about you. I've told him all about your father. He was very impressed. He said it was for young girls like you... ...he became a pilot. He said he used to fly for you. He's a decent, considerate man. One of the best. Really? Is that so? He was glad to fly for me, is that what he said? Shizuko... Why don't you marry him? He's a good man. Please, since Rabaul he's wanted to die. He needs... ...a reason to live, that you can give. Please, will you think about it? Is this the reason... ...why you brought me here? To tell me this? Is this what you want? If you marry him, it'll change his whole attitude. You see, he'll become full of hope and live for the future. You'll be happy, the two of you together. And the bicycle shop, what of that? With the rows of shinning bicycles? Were you just stringing me along with the story? Was it a lie? I'm afraid it was. I have to go home now. I'm sure you'll both be happy. Do it for him! A pilot is like a bird, free like the air Alone in the sky No one knows... ...where he dies. So... AA pilots live on their own' Girls know they never marry. A bride today, and a widow tomorrow. So a pilot never... Where's Mizushima? He had to go back home on some urgent business. I'm sorry I couldn't find anything better than this soup. Oh, delicious! Thank you very much. Very tasty! You'll be an excellent wife. I Wish he hadn’t gone... I wanted to tell Mizushima... ...I'm going back. They've agreed. They say I'm fit, so I'll fly again. I'll remember... ...this moment. Thank you. American forces swept through the Pacific. Off Leyte island in Philippines the imperial Japanese combined fleet... ...suffered a crushing defeat. Without their home based carriers... AA the ”Zero”s were increasingly used on suicide missions. Loaded with bombs they flew straight into enemy ships. Once they were the pride of the Navy. Now they were flying coffins, incinerating their pilots in a fiery hell. From the Marianas, the Americans sent out their new super flying fortress bombers... with an incredible destructive force. March 19, 1945 American forces land in Okinawa. The Japanese Navy had little to use in the islands defense. In a last ditch effort they gambled on a final throw. It's our last chance gentlemen. If we are to save Japan we must throw everything at them. The time for holding back has long since passed us by. The Japanese naval chiefs gave the orders to send to Okinawa... t' the world's largest battleship, the Yamato. It was to be the final fling of the once mighty Imperial Japanese Navy. Hamada's lonely struggle continued. All I want to is get drunk, but I'm so busy I can't spare the time. I've come here to collect my "Zero". Still flying that old death bucket? It's no match for the American Grumman fighter... They're using "Zero"s on suicide missions. Trust me... I'm a veteran. Those young puppies don't know what they're doing in the "Zero". They haven't be taught to handle it properly. There is no way I'm going to crash my "Zero". I imagine if you did captain Shimakawa would have you court-martialed... ...for negligence in the face of the enemy. Remember, when he first showed us, like if it was gold! Like it was yesterday... Children... We were like children, with our eyes popping out. Sure were... Shizuko sent me a small cushion made from the silk scan'. And I sent it up to my brother. I warn you: don't pull a fast one like that! You are the one who she really loves, and you love her. I think we'd better forget this. And you are the one who's blushing. No self-respecting girl would love a man who's all burnt up... Look, I was grateful for the gift, but she's your girl, you marry her. Hold it! Is this some kind of joke? Do'you think I'm pulling a fast one to get my revenge? Don't do it again. Next time I'm gonna let you have it with the machine-gun. Hamada! Good luck! The home evacuation exercises began. The machinery was all cracked up and dispersed to small towns throughout Japan away from the American bombers. - Mr. Sony... - It's time for us all to say goodbye. I've been sent to Matsumodo. You? I'm quiting. I'll go to Kyushu, work on a farm. I see... It's not your home. No. I have a friend stationed there, he's a fighter pilot in the air corps. Oh, you mean Mizushima... Not him. It's Hamada, the "Zero" pilot. Oh, Hamada... Oh, I remember... Will you be marrying him? I really don't know. However, I can just sit here thinking about him, when he is risking his life for the sake of all of us. I must do something... I'll do anything! There must be something I can do. Maybe I can cook all his meals for him... If I only I could live with him for just a day... It's a dream I've had for some time... I see... Well, I'm happy for you to have someone. My only wish... ...is to have designed better planes than these... ...but I didn't. I feel sorry. And now the pilots are going up in flames. But love seems to make everything right. Thank God for the heart! An air raid! The bombers! The bombers are here! Goodbye, sir! Shizuko! Look after yourself! Good luck! Hey, take cover! Run for your lives! Hey, you! Run! Come on! Get out of here! Shizuko, what're you doing?! Run! Go away from here! Go on! All right! My' Sony, the aircraft designer, kindly wrote to me about Shizuko's death. She was going to Kyushu, she said she wanted to marry you. It was the last thing she said' I swear ifs true! Scramble! All alert!l B29s attacking from the South-East! 829s attacking from the South-East! Heading for the Kanto district.' Alert for anti-aircraft fire.' All personel to their positions.' Anti-aircraft crews commence fire at will Contact! Don't tell me it hurts you! Here's some dextrose, it should pick you up a bit. Air raid! Enemy bombers! Air raid! Scramble! Air raid! Hey! Come back here! Air raid! Scramble! Bombers from South-East! Bombers from South-East! Don't scramble, take cover! Don't scramble, take cover! Take cover! Take cover! Get out of my way! Come on! Fire! The commander-in-chief of the 5th Fleet gave a personal citation. And Hamada was posthumously promoted to full lieutenant. "You've never flinched from the flight!" "You've never refused a mission! You always were the first to volunteer!" "You've shot down 70 planes on your own...§ and 40 more were credited to you in action with others!" "No other pilot did so much! You were a fine example, a hero," "a shinning light to other younger pilots, coming after you! 2 "Truly you were an ace among aces! Your contribution to your country," "your self-sacrifice does honor to us all!" "We pay homage to your for that. " "Your achievements will become part of our national history!" "On this day, August 3rd, 1945" "Commander-in-chief, 5th Air Fleet, Admiral Ugaki Matome" Shoichi... was always a very good boy. As his mother, naturally, I loved him very much. He always loved school. It was his live to him and he always did well on the game field; he enjoyed games. One year he won the provincial skiing championship. Even as a child he used to be the leader. He seemed to be better than the others. And he was always so full of enthusiasm. When he grew older, he helped me about the house. He always wanted to help me... We're a big family; he had many brothers and sisters. And he loved their company. We had so much fun! But there're so many mouths to feed! It was hard, so he left school. He always did duty toward us! The other day, he sent me a beautiful embroided cushion. He said it had been made by a girl he loved. But he was unable to love her. His body had been badly burnt, so he... ...he couldn't marry her, so he felt he couldn't keep her. Shoichi... Don't you Worry about me. You take good care of that dear girl. She's gone, to be with you! Right face! Showa 19, 5th of August The end of the war Commander! I have a request. If there is anything I can do, just name it... Will you give me a "Zero"? I know it sounds strange. Hm?! I can't bear to see the planes just sold as scrap! It's not right! They deserve a more honorable dispatch than that! Too many pilots died flying them... My best friend Hamada was one of the last to die! If we honor those men, we should also honor the planes they flew in! Hamada! For you!
