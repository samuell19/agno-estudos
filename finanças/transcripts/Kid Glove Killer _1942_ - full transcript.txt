Well, Gerry. Do I look like a mayor? - Not exactly. You look honest. You know it's a pretty big moment in my life seeing you sit there. The way you campaigned over the radio is what put me here. I never thought we'd make it. The toughest part is from now on. Doing what we said we would. And we'll do it. - Sure you will. You've got a top man in Hunter Turnley. He'll make a hard-hitting district attorney. Wait a minute. You're talking about me and Hunter Turnley. What about you? I'm going back to practising law. Look, Gerry. You are a fighter. And we are going to need fighters. You've got to give up your private practice and work with us from now on. As what? The only job I could do for you Turnley has got covered. Well, I'll talk it over with Hunter. Hello, Matty. - Hello, Gerry. Hello boys. - Hiya. I hope you have a good reason for dragging me out here tonight. I did. It looks like a lot of things are going to be thrown to Hunter Turnley. Oh it does, huh? Well, I wouldn't concern myself too much with that, Your Honor. You brush it off too easily Matty. Turnley wasn't kidding when he made his campaign promises to clean up this town. What is he going to clean up? When he starts looking for dirt I know who he is going to find. Don't you? I see what you mean. Well, this little thing will have to be taken care of. I knew you would have an idea. I can't let an ambitious kid like you down you know. Anything else? - No. That's about it. It makes a nice smoke, Your Honor. What is this "Your Honor" thing? Lots of people are called Your Honor. People who start out as special prosecutors. And then become mayors, and then governors. Even senators sometimes. Goodnight, Gerry. Goodnight, Matty. Pull her in, Jim. Swing her round that thing. Pull her in. I'm caught on a log. - Okay. Holy smoke, Jim. Look. 12 hours ago my friend Hunter Turnley was found murdered in Birch Lake. Badly beaten and bound hand and foot. Ladies and gentlemen this is the underworld's first blow .. Against the kind of governance Chatsburg will get under Mayor Richard Daniels. He asked me to get back on the air to tell you this. And also to tell you that he has more resolved than ever. To exterminate every vicious, political and criminal rat in this city. He has appointed me his special prosecutor to help him. "3 times a week I'll report our progress directly to you over this station." Now we get some action. "The first thing I promise you." "Is the quick capture and conviction of the man who killed Hunter Turnley." He'll do it too. "The next thing is the arrest of all racketeers preying on small businesses." That's telling them. Maybe we're going to get a break after all. "You'll be protected. Fear is your worst enemy." I'm sending him a letter tonight. No man in your city hall will rest one moment until we smash the corruption. That makes the rackets. That makes the murderers that threaten every one of you. Goodnight. Gerry. Anything on the Turnley killing that you couldn't say on the air? Not yet boys, but there will be. I'm going to the police lab now to check with Gordon McKay. Excuse me. Mitchell. One minute, please. A minute here, one minute there. Before you know it you've dribbled away a whole lifetime. What you doing anyway? - Just what you told me to do. Missed again? You keep that beautiful schnozz of yours out of my personal life. That's the closest you ever came to the heart. I hit a rib once. Eleven months ago. In the 3 months I've been here all you have done is massacre his right sleeve. Don't be fresh. No trace of cyanide. Did you rule out the alkaloids? Now look, Mr McKay. I hate this job and you may think I'm a creep at it. But I do know how to make an analysis. After all I didn't get my masters by slugging the board of regents. You have a master's in chemistry? I told you that when you okayed my appointment. The stuff they let out of college nowadays. Thanks. - You're welcome. Match me. Alright, I'll take your word for it. Turnley wasn't poisoned. So what happened to him? Well, somebody tied his hands and feet with a rope. Tossed him in the lake and he drowned. People get drowned every day. Only sometimes the wrong people. How are you, Gerry? What do you say, Sherlock. How are you? You don't look any different as special prosecutor .. Than you did when you were chasing ambulances. I feel a lot worse though. Any dope on Turnley? He wasn't poisoned. Of course he wasn't poisoned. I see, I see. Well, I made a mistake. A bad mistake. I should have locked her up in the file room. Miss Mitchell - Mr Ladimer. Jane - Gerry. Hello Miss Mitchell. How do you do, Mr Ladimer. The lab was getting awful dirty. Figured I needed a maid to clean the joint up. She hates chemistry. She should. Pay him no mind, Mitchell. I've heard your talks on the radio, Mr Ladimer. Oh? They don't sound like your kind of person. What kind of person would that be? She never heard a horse talk over the air before. I didn't mean that at all. He sounded so authoritative and brusque and .. Well, important. My radio personality. Okay Ladimer, you've been in there pitching long enough. I'll give you all the dope and save you a lot of snooping. Her name is Jane Mitchell. She is twenty-four. Has a master's from Montana and lives at the National Apartments. Phone number Maine 7826. With a room-mate from her home town. Her name is Margaret. The room-mate's name is Margaret. - Margaret. Any time you feel like discussing Turnley I'm ready, Mr Ladimer. Okay, my bug-chasing friend. What have you got there? We're checking on the rope that was tied to Turnley's hands and feet. Any fingerprints? No. The fellow used canvas gloves. Very fastidious. Also, smart. A lot of things stick to rope though. That's what we are doing now. What? That's what we're doing. Finding out what. The way you work we'll all be old by the time you deliver this killer. We need speed, Gordon. The mayor has committed himself on it. So have I. Mitchell. Take a peek at this. Well? Some sort of animal hair. - Right. The kid is getting good. Check it against domestic pets. Dogs and cats first. If this fiend owns a Dachshund I resign. You getting somewhere? Who knows. We are checking. Maybe I'll stick around. Watch you go through your act. Confidentially, we work better without an audience. A fine friend you are. I'm just trying to keep the wolf from her door. Yeah, I know. Anything else we can do for you, Mr Ladimer? Yeah, you can cut your throat. You ain't kidding either, pal. - So long, Gordon. Lynch, you sure only 4 people bought this tanning cream in the last 3 months? That's all, Gordon. We've checked every drugstore in the county. Yeah? "A Miss Mitchell to see Mr McKay." Send her in. - I'm in. Hello. Hello. 165 people who paid dog licence's on Schnauzers. You got a Mrs Harkness Chetwold? 1195 Park Place? Caf? society. - Got it. Good. What is with Chris Spyro? No got. No got. Lulu May? Hmm. Gaiety theater. That ought to be interesting. That's two. Allison Stacy? No Allison Stacy. It's a pretty name though. Don't you fall in love with any name but Gordon. Any chance of providing a police car for me, a driver and one of the boys? You are a cinch. Unless I miss my guess, you can send me a quart of gin tomorrow morning. Why? You going to get married? Better than that. I'm delivering Turnley's killer to you. A nice day. A little hot though. Not if you didn't kill Turnley it isn't. Thanks. Do you ever carry any matches? How do you like that? You've been mooching cigarettes off me for weeks now. When I had a boss I always carried matches for him. Oh please, Jack. Pretty soon I'll be walking home from a police car. What's the matter? Have I been making passes at you? Passes? You? You never pay attention to anyone unless you can see them through a microscope. That's how I cracked this case, isn't it? You haven't cracked it yet. Personally, I think it is all nonsense. What's nonsense? We are two grown people looking for a man who was a sailor or a cowboy. It doesn't have to be a man. Anyone who ties a square knot. Well, that's how Turnley was tied, isn't it slug? What about the burns on the hands? You found that, beautiful. All I found was tannic acid and a coal tar product called Grisol. Put the two together and it soothes a burn. But why on the hands? Didn't we find evidence of brown dye on the rope? Wasn't the ointment mixed with the dye? Didn't we prove that brown dye is used on canvas gloves. What do you want, a road map? And the Schnauzer hair was also on the rope. That means that if we find all the dope on one person we got him? He, she or it. We got him. You are okay, McKay. A little underpaid. That's all. Police. Someone to see you. He's from the police department. Tell him I made the payments yesterday. The company says okay. Did you get a burn recently? Sure. All the time. Hot grease. Let me look at your hands, please. Come on, come on. Turn them over. Okay. Okay. No trouble? There will be if you let those steaks burn. Yeah? Anyone here named Alison Stacy? Yeah, I'll get him. - Don't bother. I'd better get him. He don't like guys busting in on him. He gets sore easy. So do we. - Get back to your game. We're from homicide. Oh, that's different. At first I thought you meant trouble. What do you want? We're from downtown. Are you Alison Stacy? Yeah I guess so. Why? - What kind of a dog do you own? Do I look the kind of a guy that would waste time on a dog? No, I guess not. Let me take a look at your hands. Alright. Take a look. Turn them over. Don't waste time telling my fortune. It bores me. You bought some Grisol tanning ointment on the 3rd. The day before the election, didn't you? Yeah I did, come to think of it. - What for? Burns. Where were you burned, on your hands? No, it wasn't for me. It was for a friend camping at Jackson Lake in the northern part of the state. I see. Alright. Thanks for the cooperation. This friend of yours .. Where is he now? He ain't. Poor guy. He had a bad habit of saying things out loud. Jackson lake, huh? - Yeah. I suppose the sheriff up there has all the dope on your friend? What dope there is. What's the idea? What are you trying to pull? I think you'd better come on down to headquarters with us. You've been reading too many of them cheap detective magazines. Now get out of here. Hey, Mack. We've struck oil. [ Gunshot! ] Drop it, bud. [ Gunshot! ] Call for the ambulance, Steve. All of you, keep your hands on the table. You dial the operator. Never mind the ambulance. Just get the coroner and Lynch. Sorry I had to slug you, Mitch. Sorry. Thanks, boss. You're alright, youngster. What made you change your mind about him? I had an idea he was lying. And I knew when I saw this package. It's covered with square knots. Catch on? What some people will do to make a dollar. As I promised you a few nights ago over this same station, ladies and gentlemen. Mayor Daniels and his efficient and honest city administration .. Has apprehended the murderer of Hunter J. Turnley. It was a spectacular feat the police department accomplished. "Great praise is due to the commissioner of police." "To chief of the homicide squad Lynch, and above all .." "To the head of the scientific crime laboratory .. Gordon McKay." "From a rope and no other clues." "He pieced together the evidence which eventually led to the discovery .." "Of Allison Stacy who was killed resisting arrest." This just came, sir. Special delivery. Thank you. Phone the radio station and leave a message for Mr Ladimer. Ask him to come here when he finishes his broadcast. Very important. - Yes, sir. Then you can go, Miss Huser. I'll be working late tonight. Yes, sir. Goodnight. Goodnight. Every 24 hours brings you a cleaner city in which to live. Here's the big news today. "We have smashed the vicious restaurant racket .." "Which has bled small restaurant owners of half a million dollars a year." "Fourteen thugs and collectors were arrested in a city-wide raid." Why don't you ever give me a receipt? - A receipt? Ha. I'll see you next week, Eddie. "Restaurant owners no longer will have to pay tribute to racketeers." "And this is only a sample of what the other rackets have in store for them." Hey what you doing? I like to hear that guy. Turn him on again. He and the mayor are doing a great job. "And if you have any information." "That will help us in our fight against crime, ladies and gentlemen." "You have only to call the station." Eddie. You mustn't show the customers how you feel. "Why don't Ladimer get guys like that monkey that hits us every Friday?" Why don't he get the top guys? - Honey. What are you going to do? - Put the cops on the right track. No, don't do that, Eddie. Please don't do that. Remember when you went to the police before and then there was a leak? Honey, you'll just get beat up again and it isn't worth it. Do you think it's fun for us to slave our heads off 15 hours a day .. And everything we make going to those bloodsuckers? Don't worry, baby. I'm not going anywhere near the police. This time I am going straight to the mayor. At his home. He's an honest guy and maybe we'll get some action. So nobody will know I've talked except the mayor and me. Honey, if anything ever happened to you .. I would .. Just bury me with one of your swell hamburgers on my chest. With onions? You ought to know by now. Well, working late again, eh? It's wearing me out trying to keep up with you. Hello Gerry. Sit down please. Thanks. Hello? He's still here, Dick. He won't leave. I am afraid, dear. Alright, dear. I'll take care of it. Keep all the doors locked. Send a radio car out to my house right away. Mrs Daniels says there is a prowler outside. You want to see me? Yes, Gerry. This came about an hour ago. It's from the Warranty Life Insurance company of Canada. It says: "Mr Gerald Ladimer has made application to us .." "For an $80,000 paid-up policy." "For which he is paying $28,000 in cash." "In his application he states that is a special investigator on your staff." "We would greatly appreciate your giving us any information you have .." "Regarding his personal habits and character." "Respectfully, yours." Don't you believe in insurance? Isn't there something you want to tell me? Why yes, Mr Daniels. When you write that reference, don't say anything about my having robbed a bank. You are quite a hero to most of the people in this town. I suppose you know that, eh Gerry? Well, I hadn't thought of it that way. You are a symbol of honesty. You've rallied the people behind us and they are all eager to help. Gerry, I am absolutely sincere about our plan to clean up this town. So am I. But I can't allow the slightest suspicion to fall on us. It would ruin the start we've already made. Gerry. Where did you get that $28,000? Don't you think that is my own personal business? You and I have become pretty good friends, Gerry. I don't want to see you do anything foolish. I don't know what you're thinking .. - Well, here is what I'm thinking. Nine months ago you came to me broke. I let you 500 dollars. Since that time the total monies that you've received from me and the city. Come to $2,250. That's a long way from 28,000. Gerry, for the last time, here did you get that money? Alright. I'm sorry but tomorrow morning I start an investigation. Goodnight, Mr Mayor. What are you hanging around here for? - I want to see the mayor. The place to see the mayor is the city hall. Got any identification on you? Is that your name, Eddie Wright? - Yeah. Own your own business? Yeah. More or less. Well, you shouldn't be hanging round the street like a Vag. You'd better beat it. A pleasure to see you, Gerry. - Hello, Matty. If we get through with this fast I've got a big party inside. Yeah? I've been invited to a big party too. That's fine, Gerry. - But I'm going to be the only guest. At first. The mayor is throwing it starting tomorrow morning. Sooner or later I should expect an invitation, shouldn't I? We're in it together. Except that I've been paying you a thousand bucks a week. You've been getting value received, Matty. Every penny-alley grifter and chiseler has either left town or he's in jail. I've made this town look honest so you can collect all the gravy. True. True. It looks like out little business transaction is headed for the rocks. Not if you take care of the mayor. Now that isn't quite equitable, Gerry. You asked me to help with Hunter Turnley and I did. Even though it meant laying Stacy off. That won't happen again. From now on I'll watch every angle. I'll protect you everywhere. Wouldn't it be fairer if you handled the mayor? After all, you are the logical man. You are the closest to him. Everybody thinks well of you. It would give me the feeling that you are delivering 50 percent on our deal. Oh. Your Honor. I'll be back for it, Matty. Okay, Gerry. Hello Jane. Gerry. Fine. I'm taking you and that stupid boss of yours out tonight .. To celebrate the wind-up of that Turnley thing. I don't know where that stupid boss of mine is but I'll dig him up. Fine. I hope this is alright, Mr Ladimer. Just bring us a lot of champagne Pierre and don't worry about the table. We'll need another chair for McKay. We're expecting another. Let's do it this way. That is for McKay. A nice place. Nice music. - Nice food. And our motto is the customer is always right until we have to throw him out. Not much more of this left, Mr Ladimer. Laurent-Perrier '33. French. - Oh, really? For you there always will be a bottle. - Fine. What's the matter? - They certainly make a fuss over you. I'm the hottest kid in town. You got more credit on the Turnley case that we did. Well, it is just because they hear me on the radio. Do you want to have a dance before McKay shows up? Don't you think we are a little too middle-aged for that sort of music? They keep a pulmotor handy just in case. What was that routine Gordon was telling me about you hating chemistry and so on? I do hate it. Why do you stick at it then? I had a horrible childhood. They taught me to eat. Hello, Gerry. Well, how are you this evening, sir? Chemistry or starve? Not for the rest of your life I hope. I'll probably get married sooner or later. I hope sooner. Mr Ladimer. I could interpret that as proposal talk. Go ahead. Hold me to it. Not you attorneys. You can wriggle out of anything. Well, hello boss. Hello, Gordon. How are you? Your message said "vitally important". What's vital and what's important? I am entertaining in celebration of your spectacular scientific feat .. To capture Mr Allison Stacy. Thank you very much, Gerry. That's very decent of you. Here is half of what I just got. As a matter of fact we were very lucky to grab Stacy. And luckier still that he got killed. Why do you say that? You never can tell how juries will kick around the evidence I slap together. Stacy must have felt the same way about that you do. Until he lost his nerve. That's what I always count on. My hocus-pocus always panics a guy when he's guilty .. And right then he figures I've got more on him than I really have. You, my little man are going to get crocked. Not only that but I'm going to take myself a week to sober up. I'm going fishing up in Pine Rapids. - Who is going to cook for you? Cook for me? Are you kidding? Listen. When I whip a trout off the hook. And toss him in a pan. - Don't you clean him? Quiet please. I slit. Scoop. Wash. Salt. Oh. Solidly inside and out. Next. The butter. Now, depending on the size of .. Ants. You can't get rid of them. Depending on the size of the fish. In this case about .. A quarter of an inch spread. Now comes the master touch. Very few people know this. You got your sleeve in it. - Oh, sorry. Ketchup. Now most people .. Most people. Prefer a heavier meat sauce. But I have discovered with long years of experience. That the plain old garden-variety ketchup is by far superior. Sprinkle sparingly. Now. We take the fish. Throw it away and open up a can of beans because nobody in the world .. Could eat that fish. That's just the way I like to eat it. I'm going to Pine Rapids with you. Now you just bought yourself something. I'll pick you up at 8 in the morning. I've got a much better idea than that. I'll pick you both up. Are you going too? Why not? I'd be sucker with you there. Oh Gerry, that would be swell. We'll have a million laughs the three of us. Right. I'll pick you up at a quarter of 8 and you at 8 o'clock sharp. Hurray. We're all going fishing in Pine Rapids. We must just all be careful we hook the right fish. Dick, Darling. Tell me what it is that is bothering you. It is nothing, dear. Nothing much. I'll tell you about it tonight. You know what we will do on Sunday? - I've called a meeting .. Which you'll call off as soon as you get to the office. We're going to put on our old clothes on Sunday. And spend the whole day working in the garden like we used to. Say, wouldn't it be nice if we could have the day together for a change. I wish we could. - I think we can. I lock the front door, take the phone off the hook. And no-one will ever think we were in the garden working. We'll have dinner alone and forget all about politics. It's a difficult project but I think we can arrange it. We'll just consider that meeting cancelled. Goodbye. - Goodbye, darling. Blue thread from outside left garage door. Blue thread. Outside left door. Hold that end please. Four feet 8 and a half inches from the ground. Four feet 8 and a half inches from the ground. Have a man take the mayor's clothing down to the lab. Right. Is everything photographed just as it was? Yep. Alright boys. Let's lift up the chassis. Bring a jack, one of you. Where do you think the bomb was fastened? Judging the angle of the splinters in his body, I'd say under the floorboards. Burlap sacks directly under flywheel housing. What's that? It's a piece of the bomb. Hello Lynch. - Hi, Gerry. Pretty horrible. Whoever put it there had proper reasons for making sure. Hey Gordon. How are you, Gerry? - Hello. Any ideas who manufactured this mess? Maybe. - Found anything yet? I can't say. She is keeping it a secret. Bombing kinda destroys any clues, doesn't it. Nothing is ever destroyed, my friend. Chief. - What is it? We got a prowler call last night. A young fellow was hanging around here. Take him in? No, sir. He's not a Vag. He seemed alright, so I sent him on his way. Get his address? - Yes. Pick him up and take him to the homicide office. That's right. I was with the mayor last night in his office. Mrs Daniels called. Said something about a prowler. The mayor called a squad car. Looks like a quick break. All I ask is a few suspects to work over. You'll get them. The mayor made a new enemy every day he was in office. If you find out anything let me know, will you. ? Yeah. But they know I was hanging around the mayor's house last night. Who is they? - The cops. They came and gave the move along. They will try and pin this on me sure. Well, I'll not play the sucker any longer. I'd better get out of town for a while. Eddie, the police can't hurt you if you are innocent. Yeah? I know different. They go out of their way to be dumb. Eddie. You had nothing to do with this. I know that. And running away is only going to make you look guilty. You may be right. Wright. The chief has a lot of questions to ask you. Okay? Eddie. Don't worry, baby. I'll be back in a little while. Hiya, Lynch. Hiya, Gerry. - The wheels turning? Yeah, the wheels are turning. In quicksand. What about the suspect department? Five. Number one is a fire marshal that Daniels discharged for taking pay-offs. Yeah? We know that he threatened the mayor but he's got a vacuum-packed alibi. Number two is a guy name Bunny Martel who used to have a parking concession. Numbers three and four respectively are a nut and a crank. I didn't know there was any difference. A nut has got a mania on one subject only. A crank has got crazy ideas about everything. They both wrote threat letters to the mayor. What about number five? - A good suspect. A kid from the beanery. Eddie Wright? Yeah. We're grilling him right now. You want to listen in? - Okay. Listen closely this time, Eddie. Try to remember that minor thing called truth. Why did you go to the mayor's home? - I told you. I've been paying out protection money just so my place wouldn't be smashed. I figured the mayor was honest. I figured he'd beat down on them crooks. - That's pretty thin, Eddie. Why didn't you bring your complaint to the police? I did. Once before after they smashed my diner. Somebody in the department tipped off the crooks and they beat me up. This time I figured it was safer to go to the mayor. Oh, so you don't trust us? It's nice to know you hate cops. - What do you expect? I wasn't going to stick my neck out again if I could help it. So you went to the mayor's house and hung around like a panhandler. That's it! That's all there is to it. Interesting story. A barrel of fish. - Smells as bad too. Wright. Is that the coat you were wearing last night at the mayor's home? Why, yes. - Let's have it. Take this over to the lab right away. - Okay. Now the quicker you tell the truth the quicker you are going to get home. I am telling the truth. You are in a spot, Eddie. I'm not in any spot. You guys are just trying to put me in one. Hello Eddie. Cigarette? Do you know me? Sure. You are Gerry Ladimer. The radio racket-buster. That's right. Take it easy, take it easy. I don't believe you did this thing, Eddie. I don't think you are smart enough. Sure, I didn't do it. You can trust me as you could have the mayor. He and I were in this fight together. Now, let's get the real dope, eh Eddie. It's just like I told them cops, Mr Ladimer. I tried to see the mayor because he was the top guy. But I never got a chance to talk to him. Why should I want to kill the only guy who could help me? I see. And I believe you, Eddie. I'll do everything I can to help you. Gee, thanks, Mr Ladimer. - Okay. Don't worry. Well, what's his story? He hasn't got one. He's stalling. I think you've got your man. - I know I have. McKay wants us over at the lab. The kid too. Do you recognise this coat? The cops just took it away from me. Take a look in here. Now, that's a magnified thread taken from that coat of yours. Item "A" please. Item "A" from the scene of the bombing. Right, now look again. They look the same. They are the same. They are identical. That's all, Eddie. We've compared them for the number of fibres. We measured the weave undulations and they match. Mitchell has tested both chemically and they have the same dye. Now, this last thread you saw here we found on the door of the wrecked garage. And it came from your coat, Eddie. You didn't say anything about being near the mayor's garage. What about it? Well, I didn't think it was important. It would look bad. Mighty bad if you ask me. Take him back to my office. Thanks a lot, Gordon. - Sure, sure. Well that just about does it. We'll book Eddie Wright for murder. On what? - On what you found. You mean, because he was near the garage and caught his coat on a splinter? Look Gordon, here is how I figure it. We know the kid was hanging round the mayor's house. And you've just now shown us he was near the garage. It all adds up perfectly. Now wait just a minute, Gerry. It doesn't add up to anything. Can I help it if you can't add? Mitchell. - Yes, sir? Bring me those burnt matches will you please. I'm going to show you something. Item "K". These are some burnt matches we picked up near the garage. And here is a match you just lit your cigar with. Now, if they check. We are going to hold you for Mayor Daniels' murder. Well. Did I kill him? Look for yourself. The match on the left is evidence and the one on the right is yours. They are the same. There are probably a hundred thousand matches like Gerry's in this town. Now wouldn't I be a dope to think that anything so flimsy is conclusive? Does he mean I'm innocent? You shouldn't play gags like that on your friends. You'll be checking on me next. I had to prove to you gents that you mustn't go round jumping at conclusions. And I mean Eddie Wright. - Okay, okay. Sold. However, I'll make you a little bet. Your scientific procedure so far may not point you to Eddie Wright. But five against ten that he did it. - Maybe. When we finish Wright will be so guilty that no-one can get him out of this. Or he will be so innocent that no man can convict him. No bets? The only thing Mitchell and I ever bet on is who buys the cigarettes. And you know who always loses, don't you. Careful with matches round here. He may find you did the murder and I'd have to defend you. And I'm the prosecutor and that wouldn't be so hot would it. No it wouldn't. Mitch and I could go for a long walk. Is now too soon? Gerry, we don't know a better man for the job than you. And I think the entire city will agree with us. You will have to give me a couple of minutes, gentlemen. After all .. This idea of my running for mayor is brand new. And a little frightening. You are the one logical person to carry on the reforms started by Daniels. You know, if you were asking me to follow any other man in this job .. I wouldn't be so overwhelmed by it. To follow a man like Mayor Daniels .. You owe it to Daniels to go on with what he started. Think I have a chance? Do you think I could win? Why, of course. - Like shooting ducks in a barrel. There's one large "if" Gerry. If that special prosecutor you are able to find. Convicts the mayor's murderer. - There would be no doubt about then. He's right. Of course he's right. If I could deliver the killer today and give up any hope of ever being mayor .. I'd do it in a minute. You all know that. We know how you feel, Gerry. Good luck. - Thanks. Thanks. The Bamboo room. One o'clock. Ask for my table. Goodbye. It is lovely, Gerry. I looked all over town for the finest orchid I could find .. And I still say it doesn't do you justice. You know it is very funny. - What's very funny? The way things change. I've known you a short while. I've made up my mind the kind of person you are. How do I rate? - Not bad. Now I have to go all over the score and figure it out again. Why take all that trouble? Because you are going to be mayor. Other people see in you sides I haven't seen. Different sides. A hard side, an official side. An older side. Now wait a minute, I'm not the mayor yet. But you will be because you want to be. Well. My chances of ever getting anywhere are completely cooked .. Unless I can deliver Mayor Daniels' murderer right away. My only hope is Gordon. And Gordon's only hope is concentrating on Eddie Wright. I know that. You're sure he did it, aren't you. Every clue points to him. Every one. You may be right. - Of course I am. If I can wash up this case quickly, smartly. The people will force me right to the top. And then maybe they'll send me to Washington. It sounds okay, doesn't it? You are ambitious, Gerry. Jane, when I was a kid I never just wanted to be on the team. I wanted to be the captain. What did you do about the other little boys who wanted the same job? I was the captain. I wouldn't like to be in your way if you were headed someplace. You could never be in my way. But you could go with me. I wouldn't be surprised if I did. You mean you want to be on my team? Gerry, being with you is exciting. It is fun. But I need time. You got any other offers? I like competition. I still need time. And I haven't got it right now. Waiter. Didn't go out to lunch again, eh? Uhuh. You are going to ruin your stomach. Not until I'm forty-five. That is the ulcer age. Did you enjoy your salad with mineral-oil dressing? How did you know I had mineral-oil dressing? Because it's non-fattening. When a girl eats with a man she watches calories. And how did you know I ate with a man? The way you went out of here. And the way you came back. How are we doing? We're burning up the world, Mitchell. Powder grains from the bomb. Shall I spec them? No. Wait for Lynch. Here is the copper wire used as a conductor. Snipped off by mechanical pressure. Not cut with a knife. Not by a pair of wire cutters either. The cut isn't neat enough. Probably by a pair of ordinary fingernail clippers. Ordinary fingernail clippers? Yes. This whole thing was put together by an amateur. The chances are he used whatever he had on him to cut the wire. Then it is simple. We find where he bought the clippers and we've got him. Mitchell, you kill me. What's the matter with wanting to find the clippers? Well, it's just like those matches. There are probably a hundred thousand fingernail clippers in this town. How are you going to check on a thing like that? I can and will. We've just got to get this case solved. People are getting fidgety. What people? The People of Chatsburg. I get around. I hear what they're saying. They say anything about me? Not you specifically. The whole city administration. They want to know who killed Mayor Daniels. Well now, that's just fine. Who doesn't? I've a good mind to try and run down those fingernail clippers on my own. Any objections? - No, no. You go right ahead. If you find the murderer with that clue I'll see you get all the credit for it. I don't want credit. I want to find the murderer. Is that all? I thought you'd got ambitious enough to make a career out of this business. It's no career for a woman, boss. You know that. It's not much of a career for a man either. No prestige, no glamour, no money. People holler at you when there are no miracles. You don't think much of your chances for getting something out of life, do you. I've been a little too busy for that. How about you? I .. I want to get married I suppose. What's wrong with that? Nothing is wrong with it. If you can hypnotise some jerk into marrying you. Well. Now that is a brilliant answer for a girl I thought has some intelligence. What will you say if I said I don't have to hypnotise some jerk into marrying me? Here. Keep on picking until it is clean. Mitchell. Why bother? You are always missing the target. Yeah. Hi there, Gordon. - Good afternoon. Oh, Hello Mitchell. We've been waiting for you, Captain. This is the powder that was used in the bomb. What kind of powder? That's what we are going to find out now. Step right in. The second feature goes on in about twenty seconds. You got some new gadgets, eh? This one is called a spectrograph. Evidence goes in the hollow point of this carbon pencil, see. You are not using much evidence. You don't need much. Just a speck. Steel dust, powder. Anything. Ready, Captain? - Let 'em roll. Get the lights, Mitchell. Not running a Mickey Mouse today. Just a crime short. What's cooking in there? The material is burned under terrific heat in the lamp-house here. The flame forms a spectrum. A series of tiny vertical lines over there. Which is reflected back here to this camera. Where we now have a photograph. Alright. Lights, Mitchell. In other words, you can take any material. Find out what it is made of and how much of each element goes to make it up. Hmm. It's a smart thing to stay straight these days. Hit that film developer as soon as you can, Mitchell. I'll see you in the file room. Will Lynch as a chaperone I'll take that risk. This band of lines represents all the usual chemical elements of the spectrum. This band of lines is the photograph we just took .. Of all the chemical elements in the bomb powder. Now all we've got to do is match them up. Ready, Mitchell? - Ready, Mr McKay. Potassium. Hold it. A vanadium triplet. Vanadium. That's good. Okay with the light switch. Vanadium was put in by the manufacturer just to identify the powder. This is my gunpowder bible. It's got everything from firecrackers to 2,000-pound aerial bombs for the B17s. And who makes them. This magnum powder is made for the new high-velocity .38 revolver cartridge. It is manufactured by the Neo-Nitro Powder Company. It is sold directly to the cartridge maker and is never sold in bulk. This fellow bought a lot of .38 magnum revolver cartridges .. Pulled out the bullets and used the powder for his bomb. A hard-working guy, huh? - Yep. Know what I need now? Bring you everyone who bought .38 Magnum cartridges. That's right. Have them here tomorrow. Do you think a smart boy like this is going to admit he bought magnums? He won't have to. I'll examine the material under his fingernails. And if he's been horsing around with magnum powder it will still be there. What's wrong now? Mitchell, who gave you that orchid? That is your next crime case, doctor. Anything for dessert, folks? Yeah. I don't see that on the menu. Oh him? Oh, he is my husband. Any dessert? No dessert. Here you are. Thank you very much. That's my trouble. I am nobody's husband. Are you anybody's uncle? - Now don't change the subject. Not really. I'm ready to face facts. Well, do you think you'll ever get around to saying yes? The best I can give you is a definite maybe. Why "maybe"? Because I've got a jerky little job. Gerry, you know I can't walk out on McKay until he gets his man. And I get a vacation. Oh, that McKay will never find anyone but Eddie Wright. What he needs is more pressure. Like putting pressure on a tree to make it grow faster. Just a waste of time. We've got one good lead though. McKay has analysed the powder used in the bomb. It came from a lot of .38 magnum revolver cartridges. Pretty clever, eh? - Not so clever. Lynch is getting us a list of all the people in town who've bought them. I bought some. You did? Sure. I had to carry a gun during the campaign. I hope you are clean under the fingernails. Fingernails? People don't get gunpowder under their fingernails from playing gin rummy. Oh. Right. That's fine. - Okay. Gentlemen, thank you very much. Sorry to bother you but we had to check on everyone who had bought these shells. Gordon, you forgot about me. I bought some. If I could think of an easy way to frame you for this .. I'd do it and save myself all this trouble. That's okay with me .. If, when they strap me in and throw the switches you're sitting on my lap. No. I'll be up at Pine Rapids fishing. No. There is nothing there. That leaves you in the clear and me in the fog. What about the kid? Did you test him yet? Yeah. Not a sign of gunpowder under his nails. Maybe he wore gloves. How do you know? Maybe. I think you ought to concentrate on the kid, Gordon. He's our best bet. I don't mind a little bet now and then but not on other people's lives. Okay, okay. That's the file room. And that's the darkroom. Mitchell isn't here. Mitchell went shopping. When she comes back will you tell her that I'll phone tonight. I certainly will. If I can't think of some good way to forget to. Okay, Tootsie. How is the clipper department? You have no idea what goes on in this country. Why must they make so many thousands of the things and so many different kinds? Isn't it about time you gave up? I never give up. When you find the answer be sure to tell it to me. Why, Captain Lynch. I am not a happy guy. I don't need a microscope to see that. The public hammers at the police commission. The police commission lights fires under the chief. And the chief hits me in the face with a phone every five minutes. And you're here to pass the pressure along to me? Naturally. Why not? It's all up to you. You're the bottleneck. Lynch, at the earliest opportunity I am going to get into a quiet kind of work. Like lion taming. Cigarette department. Match me. What's the news from the outside world? Ladimer and the boys at the DA's office .. Are cooking up a watertight case against Eddie Wright. That ought to be interesting. On what? - That lead you gave them. The thread from the garage door. Those guys ought to be writing fiction. It pays a lot better. Come over here a minute. I'm just starting in on a new lead. Yeah? These are burlap sacks we found under the mayor's car. I see. The guy lay on those sacks when he planted the bomb. Now look through there. Those are fibres from these sacks. And whoever planted that bomb will have fibres like these in his hair. We can match those fibres with any we find on a suspect. And prove that they are identical. Speaking of suspects. We've got three new ones besides Eddie Wright. They are citizens who are distinctly not interested in an honest way of living. The boys are trying to poke holes in their alibis right now. Alright. We'll go over and examine them, including Eddie Wright. Mitchell. Come out of your orchid garden. I want your help on a little deal. It's a pity you are allergic to orchids. We'll take the small kit. What's this? What's this? Take it easy, Bulge. This is just a suction machine for gathering evidence. What kind of evidence? Anything we can get. Okay, but I ain't responsible. Give Miss Mitchell your name please. Joe Salinas. The people I like call me Bulge. Relax. Thanks. Nothing? Nothing on Salinas, nothing on Ryerson, nothing on Burns. And nothing on Eddie Wright. - And nothing on Eddie Wright. If he'd made the bomb we'd have found traces of powder. If he'd planted it there would have been burlap fibres and dust in his hair. We are now in the department of utter confusion. Dead-end Division. - Brother, we are out on a limb. I have a very strong hunch it's the same limb that I am going to hang from. My friend you are soured by too much contact with humanity. When I run into a dead end I just turn round and start off on a different tack. Is that stuff from the mayor's office? - Uhuh. We've check through and haven't found a thing. No writing there. I'll go over it with the Ardin spray. Sometimes pencil marks leave impressions on blank sheets underneath. If you find anything .. - I'll let you now. Come on, slug. Open up. Give me the Ardin spray. Kill the lights, Mitchell. Anything? Nope. Nothing. Anything yet? No, Mitchell. Nothing. You'd better go to lunch. Gee, thanks boss. I'll bring you a sandwich. No. No, don't bother. When you finish lunch keep looking for the .. Fingernail clipper. It may wind up being our only chance of cracking this thing. Uhuh. And I'm just the little gal that can do it. Mr Ladimer please. Gordon McKay. Hello Gerry? Fine. Thanks. Gerry, I have something very important to show you. Can you come over here? Yes you can make a five o'clock appointment. I'll only be a minute. Thanks. I'm going to make a test now that will go a long way .. To uncovering the guy that planted that bomb. Great work. Then I'll have some real news for my broadcast. Say Gordon, why don't you say a few words on the air? After all you're the one who broke this case. Oh, I don't know. Talking isn't exactly my line. Now watch this closely while I get the reagent. Bring a couple of straws. I'm sorry, Gerry. No! Keep your hands away. That's caustic, you might get burned. Well do something. Quick! I give up. And if I ever see you use one of those clippers on your fingernails .. I quit without notice. You won't have to, Mitch. I've got him. Boss, really? Who is it? I'll let you know definitely later. I want to be sure first. Oh please, who is he? - I said I'd tell you later, Mitchell. How did you get him? The hair test. His hair was full of powder grains and burlap fibres. A couple of more checks and it will be conclusive. I'm glad it's all over. It definitely takes us out of the "dope" class. Do you mind if I run along since there's nothing more to do on this? I've got sort-of an important date. Yeah, I know. That was swell. That Rio. What a place. They tell me. Never been there. You haven't? We'll have to take care of that right away. And how do we do that? I take you to Rio. - You do? Certainly. It must be wonderful honeymoon country. I'd love it. Well that settles it. I think we ought to fly. Did you ever fly? Once. Would you mind? I wouldn't mind anything with you, Gerry. You know that. When do we leave? I could leave almost any time. Tomorrow even. - You can? McKay has got the killer. He has? Who, Eddie Wright? - Nope. He was cleared. He wouldn't tell me who. He won't tell anybody until he's ready. All he said is that he has got him. Well that's fine. I'm so relieved. It was beginning to look like we were a couple of idiots. How did he get him? From some samples of dust and powder taken from the person's hair. That was pretty smart of him. Gerry, darling. I can use a drink. And a drink you shall have. Uhoh. Clumsy ox. What did you do? - Spilled a drink all over my coat. Never mind, darling. I'll fix it. I won't be a minute. Alright. Hello Matty. This is Gerry. Trouble. Call me back right away. Hello? Yes, this is Mr Ladimer. Oh, hello Mr Baker. How are you, sir? Okay, so I'm calling you right back. What's the trouble and what is this "Mr Baker" baloney? Well, I don't know. I'm pretty busy tonight but .. If it's so important it won't wait until morning I guess you can come over. But make it as soon as you can. I'm planning on going out this evening. Alright, Mr Baker. See you in about ten minutes. Of all the silly things. What's the matter, darling? - A dope named Baker. One of the boys from the DA's office called to say he must see me right away. If it is private I'll go. Would you mind, darling? I'll tell you what. I'll get rid of this guy as soon as I can. And then we'll go dancing and talk some more about Rio. I can't go in these clothes. Well. Tell you what. Let's save you some time. You take my car and go home. Change. And come back here and by that time I'll be all ready. Sold. Wait a minute. I got two things. The keys to my car. And this. I'm only going to be gone an hour. Goodbye. - Goodbye. [ Doorbell ] Hello Matty. - Hello Gerry. Glad you are here. What's the matter? You look a bit jittery, Your Honor. My pal McKay pulled a fast one. But you were sitting in his lap? I thought so, but he's got me for sure. I'm cooked. Cool down, kid. Take it easy. What's he got? Evidence. Conclusive evidence. I'm as good as dead I tell you. Malarkey. Take the evidence away from him. Yeah? How? You've got a brain. You've got two hands. And now you've got this. Get up! Away from the table. What for? I want that evidence you took. Gerry, you are crazy. Put that gun away. Either you give me that evidence or you'll go where I sent the mayor. Now get going. Hello Boss. - Welcome home, Mitch. Didn't anybody clean up around here for six weeks? How was the vacation? I got a lot of things out of my system. That won't hurt you any. What have you been busying your little mind on? 0h, a silly jerk stepped in the way of his sweetheart's sledge hammer. A woman wielding a sledge hammer? Yeah. She was a blacksmith at a plane factory. Come over here, Mitch. I need a little help. Take a look at this. You know boss, I always said this was no job for a woman. Stop beeping and look into the microscope. I've been doing a lot of thinking and .. - Look into the thing there. Is this evidence or did you write it yourself? I wrote that with my own little hand. That's all I've been waiting to hear. Match me. -(sd)-
