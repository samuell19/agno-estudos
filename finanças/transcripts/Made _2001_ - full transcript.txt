Hey, you fight like a girl! Come on, you guys. Let's go! What the hell was that? You guys suck! Let us see something. Yeah! Come on, man, do something! - Come on, ladies. - Come on! Hey, come on. Hit the guy! Box. Yeah! Yeah! Break, break, break! Get the fuck off of me. - Step back. Step back. - There's no point for that shit... Step back when I tell you to. That's a late hit. - Fuck you! - That's hit late. - Did you talk to Max about the job stuff? - What about boxing? You told me that if you didn't have a winning record after 11 fights, then you'd be more than happy to talk to Max concerning the job. - Yeah, and? - And it was a draw tonight. And I'm 5, 5 and 1. And 5, 5 and 1, that's not a winning record. - Yeah, it's not a losing record. - But, Bob, that's not what you said. You said, if you didn't have a winning record after 11 fights, you'd be... - Don't be shitty. - How am I being shitty? - Just, please. Don't be shitty. - How am I being shitty? How am I being shitty to you? - I'm home. - You're late. I'm not late. I just got done. - What kind of gig is this? - Easy night. Bachelor party. - Oh, can we give Wendy a ride? - No. Oh, my God, baby. What happened to your face? It was a draw. What kind of bachelor party is it? Easy kind. Young, rich, well-mannered. What makes you think they're well-mannered? - Why, 'cause they're rich? - Bobby, this is a plum gig. It's a bunch of young, hot-shot agents at a restaurant. It'll be easy, and I'll make a lot of money. Well, you're working with Wendy. I don't like when you work with Wendy. Sweetie, they requested her. Max is only putting me on as a favor. Yeah, some favor. I hope they know you're not like her. Oh, please. You know what they're like. God knows what they're expecting if they hired Wendy. Hey, get ready. We're late. - Who's watching the kid? - She's downstairs with Rose. Come on. Get ready. I'm ready. Let's go. I'm waiting on you. - Did you talk to Maxie today? - I am not gonna mention Ricky to him. No, I don't want you to mention it to him... The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in, too. Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen, honey. You know that. Here. I'm fine. You want to help Ricky, you talk to Maxie yourself. Well, I feel weird doing it, you know what I mean? 'Cause he's, like... You know what, forget Ricky. You should be glad Maxie's got you driving for me. Can I get one? Hennessy and Coke. With an ice cube. And put it in a snifter this time. You know snifters are for warm drinks. Yeah? - Did you know snifters is for cognac? - Yeah, when it's served warm. You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker? We have snifters. Like I'm gonna break your goddamn snifter. Been a rough night, man. Where the fuck you been? - Had a fight at the Sportsmen's. - Really? Did you hit the motherfucker at least once? - It was a draw. - Damn. - What's your record now? - It's 5, 5 and 1. That shit ain't fly, man. Busting concrete, you're laying bricks, whatever the hell you're doing. Might be nice to buy your bitch something. No touching. Hey, hey, hey. No touching. No touching! - What about them? - I don't give a shit about that I work for her. Okay? No touching. - You okay? - Yeah. Who the fuck was that? I said, no touching. God damn it! Well, as you can see, I've decided to improvise a little bit. The basic concept is now a surprise around every corner. Oh, I love that. You see, he's laying in a koi pond. Isn't it brilliant? In the kitchen. - I like that idea. - I do, too. The flow in this room is gonna be fabulous. The parties that you will have, you won't believe it. Unfortunately, the trades are stacking a bit. Excuse me? You don't have to hit me. - This is where the étagère's gonna go. - Excuse me? Excuse me? I'm sweeping, you don't have to hit me with the whip. You got a horse outside? Don't hit me with the whip, please. What's your name? My name's not important. I'm trying to do a job... - What's your name? - My name's not important. - What's your name? - My name is Bob Ricigliano. Bob Ricigliano. Well, you stay after school, Bob Ricigliano. Don't hit me with your fucking whip again, man. I'm serious. What the hell is going on here? Honey, so listen, let me handle it, all right? Excuse me. Do you speak English? - Yes. - My studs are too far apart. This is supposed to be 15 and three quarter inches. And they're 16 inches. My studs are too far apart. - Okay... - I don't like it. - I'm a mason. - I don't like it. - But Arthur's gonna be here... - Do it over. And the GC and... - What's your name? - Bobby. - Bobby what? - Bobby Ricigliano. Jesus Christ, is everyone in this goddamn house named Bobby Ricigliano? I don't understand what you're saying. I'm having a brilliant piece of teak sent from Bali today. This is a spice rack. - Bernardo. - What? Look, all I want to know is, we'll be in by Easter, right? It'll be moved in when I'm goddamn good and ready. What are you talking about? - Where's he going now? - Bernardo? Why do you always got to hire these guys? Because... All right, but I don't understand, okay? - Come on, Adam. - It's really... Come on, Adam. Let's go already. Come on! - Hey, Bobby, you see that? - Did I see what? She was throwing shit. The lady was throwing me vibes and stuff. - I think she wants to fuck me. - No, I didn't catch that. - You didn't catch anything at all? - No. Oh, my shit's blowing up. - Come on, man. - I gotta make a fucking call. That's the job phone. I know it's the job phone, but I gotta use it if I got a fucking phone call happening. - Ricky... - What other phone am I gonna use? I don't have a fucking cell phone. Ricky, the owners are here. It's not cool. - Watch out, the fag's here. - Hello. Hey, I'm thinking about cutting out early... Hey, get off the fucking phone. Now. - I understand, one second... - Now. Get off the phone. I gotta get off the phone. Okay. What, do you think you're on piecework? Just making a quick phone call. - I've been busting my ass all day. - Yeah, you've been busting your ass. W-O-R-K. 4 letters, that's all. Work. - But I'm busting my ass... - Now! And you want to know why you're still sweeping floors. Bobby, can I see you for a minute? - I got this... - One minute. That's it. Come on. Who the fuck is he to scream at me like that? I'm making a fucking call. What if it was an important family situation or something. I'm gonna go relax a little. I don't think I could be any good to you now. I'll be back in about 15. 20. Come here. Look, Bobby. I don't know what happened, I don't want to know what happened. But something's up. What are you talking about? Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. And he wants you to stop by the office today. He was grabbing her fucking ass. What am I supposed to do? Hey, hey, hey, I don't know, and I don't want to know. As far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though. Without you here, I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep. Just do me a favor, Arthur, please. This guy has done a lot for me when I was younger, okay? Just keep him on until I can figure out what's happening. All right, please? - I'll do what I can, Bobby. - I appreciate it. I do. - All right. - I'm gonna take care of this. - Good luck. - Thank you. Can you just calm down a minute? You're gonna get the money. How do I know? You have my word. Is that enough? You know, you talk too much. Get off the fucking phone. I love you. All right. Goodbye. Oh, God... You like the ponies? Yeah, sure. - You bet ponies? - No. Not really. Oh, it's hard. They're hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Jai alai. - With the... - Yeah. You know why I like it? It's fixed. Sure thing. That's the only way to win. You see that horse there? The blaze. This one. - This one here? - Yeah, yeah. I bought the horse in '66. I hired a trainer, stall, whatever. That horse made me $100,000. In '60s dollars, you know what that is? - Yeah, it's a... - It's a lot of money. - It's a lot of money, yeah. - A million, easy. - Must have been some fast horse. - He never won a race. He got me in good with the trainer. Sit down, Bob. Attaboy. Yeah, the trainer and I, we had a thing. I don't remember what it was. Some fucking thing. The jockey would raise the fucking whip, and whatever the fuck it was. So we had a good thing. But you know, this one tells that one, the other one tells another one, and before you know it, the whole world, everybody's in on it. That's what you call smart money, right? Yeah, that's... Yeah, that's the smart money. Bobby, I like you. Why do you make it so hard for me to take care of you? Max, I swear to God, these guys were out of line. Yeah, I know. You know, maybe last time with the Puerto Ricans. - These were nice, Jewish boys. - They were out of line. Bobby, I love Jessica just like she's my flesh and blood. I would kill anyone if they as much as laid a finger on her or her beautiful daughter. But that fucking pisher that you socked in the teeth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills, wants I should buy him an implant. Your gorilla horse shit cost me 8 grand. Okay. If it's money, I'll work it off. You know I'm good for it. Not driving Jessica, you won't. - What are you talking about? - Two strikes, Bobby. And the second one was big. The bachelor's father, he belongs to my shul. So... What? That's it? I'm out. It's over. - Did I say that? - No. I don't know what... I'm saying, it's my fault. I'm sending you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, and then I wonder why you see red. It's my fault. The tooth is on me, but no more. I'm reassigning you. I... No, no. I don't want to drive another girl. The only reason I'm working here, Max, is because I want to be around Jess. Hey, is this a fucking democracy? Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? You want out? Do I put food on your table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay for that dead beat friend of yours for pushing a goddamn broom. Yeah, I know... So are you ready to sit down and listen? Sit down! Sit down and hear! - Can you hear now? - Yeah. I think I got something that'll make everybody happy. I work with a guy named Ruiz. I want you to go with him, accompany him on a drop. He's got his own men. You're just scenery. I want a big guinea with a busted face hanging around as a deterrent. You go, I take care of you. And we're square on the tooth. I... It... What about Ricky? He would jump at an opportunity to do this. Ricky? Ricky "I lost the truck" Ricky? I... You said you liked him. You wanted to work with him. That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van. Okay. Let me talk to him. He'll work it off. Jesus, you know, I don't know the kid. The little that I know about him scares me. Well, I grew up with him, Max, and he's a good guy. Well. You vouch for him? I... I grew up with the guy. You vouch for him? - Do I... You mean, do I... - Do you vouch for him? He... Yeah. Yeah, of course I vouch for him. How about this? You're in, he's in. I don't... Bobby, you're beating people up. You might as well get paid for it. Think about it. You gotta take that guy out! You own that guy! You own him! Come on! - We need guns. - He didn't say anything about guns. He implied something about guns, I'm sure. No, it's not something you imply. It's something you lay out on the table. He didn't say anything about guns. Besides, I'm not even taking the job. This is the opportunity of a lifetime, Bobby. Are you nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity for a long time. No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity. You're damn straight I've been waiting for this kind of opportunity. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? You do good on something like this, and then you're in. - You have opportunities after that. - What about boxing? - Bobby, you're out of your mind. - You're full of shit... I clown with you for two fucking rounds, and did this shit, or whatever... Oh, stop. And it was a fucking draw, and I didn't even train for the fight. That was horse shit. My point is you're not gonna be a professional boxer. You want to do it, let's do it right now. - No, no, no, I wanna do it right now, - You couldn't even... - Don't start fucking pushing me... - Right now! Right now! Fuck you, man. - Don't be a fucking child. - Come on. - Don't be a fucking child. - Ricky, Bobby, cut that shit out! - Sorry, Coach. - Sorry, Coach. How's the boxing going? It's going really good, Coach. - Yeah, really good. He's 5, 5 and 1. - Stick with it, Bobby. You know it takes time. You always had the heart. How about me, Coach? Did I always have heart? What are you gawking at, ladies? This is not recess. Run a play. Let's run a play. Fuck him. You'd think he'd let it go after a while. No, the fact is, we probably could've beat Fairfax. If you hadn't got suspended. - Whatever, man. Fucking asshole. - I mean, T-shirts, really. I liked those shirts. You never wore those shirts? You could've bought the shirts. I mean, I almost got suspended over that shit. Thank God you took the bullet for me and didn't say anything. Appreciate it. - Want a hit? - No, man. I gotta pick up the baby. Why do you always get stuck picking up the kid? I like it, okay? Bob, it's not even your kid. You want to come, you want a lift, or you want to stay here and walk? I don't know why we don't get a drink instead of sitting inside this place. I promised Chloe we'd come here. She doesn't even know where the hell she is, Bob. She'd have more fun if we were at Bordners. She could play the trivia game like she likes it, or the little racing game thing she does. She's a little girl. Little girls don't like to go to bars. We had fun. We went to bars when we were kids. Met all the different people, right? Remember Slimmy? Excuse me, sir. There's no smoking allowed in the store. - Why, you serving food? - No. It's store policy. And you can't sit at a station unless you purchase a ceramic. Can you believe this shit? I can't sit at a station without purchasing a ceramic? No. Why don't you bring me an ashtray then. Can I color me that, a ceramic ashtray? Right away. - And what color paints can I get you? - I don't know. Surprise me. I'm not sure what I'm feeling today. Now, listen to me. I think Maxie's really starting to reach out to you with this whole thing, and it's not something that you should let slip by... What's wrong, baby? - He's not doing it. - He's not what? - What is she saying? - He's not painting. I don't have any paint. I'm gonna paint when I get my paints. There you go. There's a nice way to do that. Maxie won't let me drive Jess anymore. - Who's he got driving her? - I don't know. I don't know what he's got going on. I... Isn't it fun? - What's that, sweetie? - Isn't it fun? - What's that? - Isn't it fun? - What's fun? - Isn't it fun to paint? To paint? Yeah. I love it. It really calms me down. Frogs aren't purple, by the way. Have you ever seen a purple frog? Yeah? Okay. When? When you were asleep? Why are you giving her a hard time? Now listen. I mean, this is gonna be a good opportunity. If we play this right... I don't know anything. He's a sketchy character. I don't want to talk about him in front of the... - Okay, let's drop it. - The aby-bay. Let's drop it. Let's ex-nay on the bex-nay. Ig-pay addi-lay. - Can you ut-shay your outh-may. - Aying saying I don't know. You're doing it wrong. I don't understand what the hell you're saying... Orange-pay u-bay. - I'm gonna ack-smay your ass. - Way. Ut-shay your ac-efay. Asshole. Did you hear that? Did you hear what he said? What do you think of that? There you go, sweetie. I don't want grilled cheese. - You love grilled cheese. - I hate cheese. Come on, sweetie. Mommy's in a hurry. Don't be a little shit, okay? - Hey, hon? - Yeah. I'll fix her some dinner. Why don't you go get ready? - You sure? - Yeah. Oh, thanks, sweetie. Bobby's gonna fix you something, okay? I love you. You're not my daddy. You want to bust my horns, or do you want some spaghetti? I want spaghetti. Of course, you want spaghetti. It's your favorite food, right? Yeah. I want you to watch me very carefully, so you learn how to cook. If you don't know how to cook, you gotta eat in restaurants every day. You don't want to do that, because all the cooks in the restaurants, they scratch their ass, they touch the food, and it's no good, it's not clean. Now, there's things that you want to spend your money on. Instead of restaurants, right? What do you want to spend your money on? - Turtles and stuff that I care about. - Turtles. Stuff like, what do you care about? I care about getting food for my pets and feeding them every day. That's right. Feeding them every day. 'Cause if you don't feed the animals, what happens? - They die. - They die, right? That's what's good about this is it's called Pasta Puttanesca. You know what that means? That means "Bad girl's pasta." And it's only enough for one. That means you get to eat it. That means I got to eat a grilled cheese sandwich. Look at that. Can you smell that? - Yeah. - Smells good. - Baby, can you get that? - All right, hon. Don't touch the stove. It's hot. Don't touch it. I got it. Jess ready? - You're driving Jess? - Yep. No way that cocksucker's driving you. - Ho's fine. - Ho's not... Ho's a fucking pimp. Okay? He encourages Wendy to turn tricks, and she's his fucking wife! Can you keep it down? He can hear you. It's my house. I'm not gonna keep it down. He's not fucking driving you! Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job, okay? And it puts a roof over me and my daughter and you, for as long as you want to stay. I want you to quit. Will you look at my bills? I can't. I mean, I'm not gonna put her through what I went through. I just can't do it. - I'll support you. - With what? I... Maxie offered to stake me. Max offers a lot of things, okay? Got news for you, baby. He's not the sweet, old guy you think he is. Don't get my hopes up, okay? If I quit and it doesn't work out, then what? I can't go through this again. This is the last time I speak to either of you in person about work-related matters. All our interactions in the future will be social. If you have any questions that are work-related, you will direct them to Ruiz. He has my complete confidence. Everything you need or need to know is in those envelopes. Do not open these envelopes until you have left the office. I started opening it before I could... Do you mind if I borrow a piece of tape? - Just... That way I could... - Open the fucking thing. You will each have $1,500, a numeric pager, an AA battery and a first class round trip ticket to JFK. You will be contacted on your pager... So we're going to New York City? Yes, you're going to New York. - You will be contacted on your pager... - Max, one more thing. Who am I dropping this off to? Who gets their hands on this? That's your per diem. Yeah. That's my per diem. And who do I give it to? - Who do I drop it off to? - It's yours. - You keep it. - This is mine to have? Yes. - For spending money? - Yes. And you got 1,500, too. You will be contacted on your pager as to where you go. You have each been given an extra battery, so there should be absolutely no excuse when you get a page, that you will answer it immediately. - Yes. - Yes, sir. You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not, for that matter, carry anything other than what I have just given you. Keys? What? What about my house keys? 'Cause that way I can get back in when I come in town. I could leave them with you, Max. Whatever you want to do, you're calling the shots. You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone when you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be on call and available 24 hours a day. That means that you do not get drunk, or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. If they call you up and they ask you the account, you say, "Cardiff Giant." They will come and they will pick you up and take you wherever you want to go. That means that there is no destination that you cannot reach within 15 minutes. Is there a pattern forming here? - Absolutely. - Yeah. What is it? You want us to be wherever you want us... Let him tell me. Don't worry about it. I got it. Tell me. What is it? I don't understand why you singled... Why you're picking on me, Max. I mean, I listened... Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van! And I don't like you, you cocksucker! I parked the van, and I left it for five minutes... You want us to be wherever you want us to be ASAP. And I also put the Club on the fucking van. Yes. Goodbye. What am I dropping off on the trip? What's the... What's the... What are we... Goodbye! Here we are. 3D and G. - 3D and G. - 3D and G. I think you got it wrong, Bob. That's... That's mine, I'm in 3D. - You're right here, you're in 3G. - It's both aisles. What's the... Because I have an assigned seat. I like to follow the rules. Okay. - You're in 3G and I'm in 3D. - All right. Good. Oh, man. See, when you're with Maxie, he takes care of your shit. - You know what I mean? - Yeah. Stretch it out, keep it nice, and I'll tell you what else? What? Beats the hell out of cleaning carpets. You got that right. Comfortable, comfortable, comfortable. - I wonder what the movie is. - I'll ask the lady what the movie is. - Don't bug her, she's... - They like to help. That's what they're here for. Get used to it, man. Don't carry guilt with it. - Champagne or orange juice? - Oh, perfect. What a wonderful kick off to the trip. - Cheers. - Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. Got a button down here. I love this shit. I mean, this is the kind of thing I'm talking about. Are you staying with me on this? Give me it, right here. - Yes? - Yeah, I was just wondering... - Excuse me. - Sorry. - ...what the movie was tonight. - It's in your copy of Ambassador. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes. I can bring the list of videos if you like. I just want to offer the other passengers a drink first. That's great. But what's the overhead on something like that? What's the action that's gonna come my way? From the videos. What's the action that's gonna come your way? Yeah. What's it gonna cost me for the videos? Oh, no. You're up front. Everything's free up here. Oh, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. - You see that shit? - Yeah. Oh, wait a minute. That's... See, now... They set you up. They make it like everything's free, then they drop this on you. I bet there's a hidden tax for this. - Excuse me, sweetie. - Yes? Excuse me. Where the drinks are concerned, is that a hidden tax? Does that fall under the complimentary, up-front service as well, or is that something you pay for? No, no. They're complimentary. Would you care for another one? - They're complimentary? - Yes. You bet your ass I would. - Thank you very much. I appreciate it. - Okay. Thank you. Can I get a Cutty on the rocks, too? - Sure. - Is that complimentary? Yes, yes. - Cheers, man. You hear that shit? - Oh, yeah. - Everything up here is free. - Okay. So you can drink as much as you want up front. Have a nice thing, we got our videos going. If we didn't have to be on call, we could drink as much as we want, but we really shouldn't. Oh, yeah, because they're probably gonna page us, and ask us to whack out the pilot up front You know what I mean? Unless we have something to do in the next 5 hours, we could probably sit here and have some drinks and relax like gentlemen and enjoy ourselves, - and actually have fun with the trip. - True. - Versus complaining about the trip. - True. And every time I try to sit down, it's gotta be your seat, my seat. Here's the thing, as long as we don't show up hammered... As long as we don't talk to someone like a school teacher, we have a fun trip. We have to represent Max, It's part of the deal. It's all we have to do. I'm representing fucking Max, motherfucker. Don't. Can you stop with the... - Yes. Excuse me. - Hi. I'm sorry, I want to know where you're located. - Where's your home? - I operate out of Chicago. I'm Ricky Slade, by the way. It's nice to meet you. It's a pleasure to meet you. And this is my friend here. This is Robert Ricigliano. And what was your name? Terry. Terry, here's what I'm gonna ask of you. Turns out, we're gonna be spending the night in New York. So it worked out well for all of us. I want you to take it back to the business class, I want you to round up a couple of honeys. At our hotel room, we're gonna have kind of a pool party. Like a California gangster style, you know what I mean? Kick ass, pool party thing. All right, listen, asshole. I don't care if you're the Sultan of Brunei, no man talks to me like that. Now you can either learn some manners, or I can make a formal complaint to the airport authorities, and we can sort this out while you're waiting standby for the next flight to Kennedy. Okay, yeah. What does that mean, "We can sort it out"? Did she have to do that so they don't know she's into my shit? I'll sort it out right now, you know what I mean? Shit. I got no pages. I don't even know where the hell we're supposed to go. Maybe we should just call a cab or something. Oh, wait, wait, wait. There's our guy. Look. With the sign. "Cardiff Giant,". - I think that's us. - Hi. I'm Jimmy. - Bobby. - Ricky Slade. Soho Grand, right? You're going to the Soho Grand Hotel, am I right? I don't know. All I know, Cardiff Giant, that's our account. Right. And you're staying at the Soho Grand. - You got any luggage checked? - No. Traveling light. I like that. Hey, is it nice? - What? - The hotel. - The Soho Grand? - Yeah. - You're from LA, right? - You're damn right, I am. You'll love it. See, that's what I'm talking about, Bobby. First class, you know what I mean? You gotta get used to it, my man. You deserve this. Looking good. Hey, lady, you missed out. I'm staying at the Soho Grand this trip. You know what I mean? Listen, I'd give you a ride in my limo, but I gotta stretch my shit out I'm a tall drink of water. I don't want to wrinkle anything. That's good. Okay. So, whenever I want to... Yeah. Well, grab one of those cards over there by the phone. - Right over there. - You mean by the thing? Yeah. Call my number. It's my cell. Okay. Want one? Here. Give me the card. Perfect, my man. So, Jimbo, you're pretty much like my boy for this thing. Like my own private guy. Well, I handle most of Cardiff Giant's accounts. - Yeah. - Okay. - Now, do you know my pager number? - I don't know. What is it? I don't know. I thought maybe you'd know what it is. You got any idea what kind of job I'm throwing down this time? The job? Well, all I know is that I'm taking you to the Soho Grand. - Where is that? - It's in Soho. The area's called Soho because It's located just directly south of Houston. - Therefore, it's Soho. - Got it. There's a spa downstairs. You gentlemen work out? Yeah. Let's just see the digs here. Is it all right? - Oh, nice. - Looking good? There's an excellent cafe called Caviar. It's downstairs, and it's great for people watching, and Willem Dafoe comes there sometimes. That's good. - Where are you gentlemen from? - From out of town. - Here's the key to the mini bar. - Oh, great. Is that for this here? Room and tax have been picked up by Cardiff Giant. Sure has. - Plus 150 in incidentals. - Okay. I'm sorry. An incidental. I'm not following exactly. Oh, that's... Phorie, room service, mini bar. Any additional expense. - It's okay. - Thanks a lot. You take care. Why don't you show him his room? Oh, Mr. Slade. You're in room 808. Just give me the key. I'm gonna hang here for a little bit. Thanks a lot. Oh, is it good? What's that? - Right, okay, let's see here. - The room? I can take you down there. No, that's all right. Let's see here. That's all I got. You got change for 100? I don't. Not on me, sir. Okay, bring me back 80. - Are you sure? - Go on. You know what we're doing. - Thank you very much, sir. - So how is it? Just so I know. I'm sorry? What kind of room are we looking at now that this happened? Oh, all the suites are about the same, sir. Yeah. Okay. Look, I don't have a lot of time to negotiate. I know you got fish to drop off probably, or whatever you got to do. What are we looking at? Honestly, the suites are about the same. If you bring me back 60, does one suite look better than the other suites? - Hi, girls. Uncle Bobby here. - I can't hear you. It's as good a suite as we have. Unless you want two bedrooms. Would you like two bedrooms? No. That's cool. Pull that off. Just make sure I get back the original 80. At this point, I want back the 80. But the 20 is for you, Captain. Thanks for showing us up. - Thank you very much. - Thanks a lot, man. Hey, one last thing, though. Where's the place tonight? - As far as? - You know, night life? The hot ass? Oh, women? Yeah, women. If I was a fag, I could get laid on the subway. Come on, Captain. Stay with me here. Just stay with me. Go quickly. I don't know. Oh, The Forum. The Forum's pretty hot tonight. - Forum's hot? - Might be hard to get in, though. You let me worry about that. Look at me, okay? What's the address? - Throw it to me. - It's on West Broadway. West Broadway, perfect. - You want me to write it down? - No, no. We'll see you with the 80. I'll bring up your change and I'll put this in your room. Don't spill that shit, 'cause I like the fish. - Come on. - Who are you calling now? Don't worry. Hello, room service? Yeah. Can I get a couple of cheeseburgers and two Heinekens, please? No, I'm Ricky Slade, but I'm actually staying in... How did you know that? Oh, really? That's cool. They got computers, so you don't have to say what room you're in. Find out how much it is, okay? Bobby, you don't have to say anything, they know where you're at. How much is it? Perfect. If it's up in the next 15 minutes, I'm gonna tell you how I do it right now. $10 tip. That's how I'm gonna do it the whole trip. I'm setting a precedent now. - How much is it? - So in the future when I call and I say that to you... - How much? - Okay? All right. - How much was it? - It's 46. That's all. 46 plus 10. Yeah, but that's kind of... You have to tip people, Bobby. Whatever, yeah, it's my fucking room. You don't give a shit. Bobby, you heard the captain. You have $150 in incidentals. That falls under the incidental, but you didn't want to listen to that. Ricky, how long are we gonna be here? - I have no idea. - We don't know. That's my point. We might have to make it last. Do you want me to call down and have them put it on my bill? I want this to stop. It's on me, okay? I want it to stop, too. - I'm trying... - Let's just... I looked forward to this trip for a long time. Could we just be smart about this? I'll be smart about it, man. Fine. But I'm gonna tell you something. I don't like your attitude from the start. I don't like the way... - You don't like my attitude? - No, I don't. What's wrong with my attitude? Take a look around, we happen to be moving up in the world. We should be enjoying ourselves. I know you had a blue collar mentality pounded into your fucking head your whole life. I have, too. But if you act like a fucking asshole and you don't own your shit, they'll smell you coming away like a cheap suit. Who's gonna... And that's the truth. You'll be embarrassed. Who's gonna smell me? I swear to God. I'm trying to save you when we have to meet the real people, that you don't come off like, you know... - I don't want to say it. - I'm trying to make this work. I don't want to get into name calling. - I don't want to get into name calling. - Okay. - Can we make this work, please? - I'm trying to make it work. Okay, let's just settle down... But you know what the fuck I'm talking about. - No, I don't know... - Don't play dumb with me, my man. - What are you doing? - What the fuck are you doing? I know you're not calling Jimmy. As a matter of fact, I am. You got a problem with that, too? Just... Rick, hang up the phone. I'll talk to you, just hang up the phone. Look, we're here representing Max, and you're running around like a Puerto Rican on the 15th of the month. You don't think Maxie wants us to roll hard, why the hell would he give us all the bread or the fucking pager? You represent Max well by showing some fucking class. The man has got an operation in New York, Bobby. - Please hang up the phone. - I am not nickel-and-diming my way... Please, the bar is across the street We can walk there. I don't wanna fucking walk! - Give me the fucking phone! - I don't fucking want to! - Give me the fucking phone! - I don't fucking want to! Fuck... How do you like that, little... Shithead! How about Jimmy? You know Jimmy the driver? Or Cardiff Giant? Maybe you should check that. Cardiff Giant. You ever deal with them before? You ever dealt with my people before? You know Jimmy the driver? Are you familiar with him or Cardiff Giant? We're with the Cardiff Giant account. Fucking horse shit. Maybe you should try the China Club. Fuck you, asshole! Place looked like a fucking fag bar anyway, don't you think? Probably a fucking fag bar. That's it. That's it. That's us. - Let's go. - Move your shit. Fuck. What the fuck are you doing? You gotta call him. It's out of order. Asshole! Whatever you want me to do. I had a really good time the other night with you. So why don't we make a part two? - Excuse me. - Give me a second. Give me a second. Yes, sort of, like, you know. I need to use the phone. It's an important call I have to make. - You have to give me a minute, okay? - Okay. A minute. A minute. Whatever. Yeah, so I'm like gonna rub your feet, give you a back massage. Hey, look. It's an emergency. I have to use the phone. I'll pay for the call. Hold on a fucking minute. There's a million fucking phones in this city. You're fucking with my phone. You're gonna have to wait a fucking minute. All right? This is bullshit. This is bullshit. I just wanna... He'll call you back. Jimmy, you know where this address is? Yeah. I'll find it. I know Harlem. Harlem? Is that where... We're going to Harlem? You don't know where you're going? No, I know... I know the cross streets. Well, this is the corner. - I can wait around if you want. - No, it's cool, man. What exactly did they say to you? They said meet them on the corner of 135th Street and 12th Avenue. Did they tell you what kind of address? I told you what they said. They said meet them here. - They didn't say anything else? - I told you what they said. No. Well, how the fuck did they know who you were then? - They asked me who I was. - See, then they said more... No, they didn't say shit. They fucking said... They asked me who I was, and then they said to meet them on the street. That's my point. They said more than what the fuck the thing was. They did say more than what you said that they said. Just be honest. They said more than what you said that they said. They said fucking meet here, okay? Oh, fuck. This is such fucking bullshit, man. I don't know where the fuck I am. What the fuck do you have to complain about? Don't even fucking start with me, man. Because you should get fucking information when you're on the phone. I don't understand what you've got to fucking complain about, man. Why is this gig so fucking horrible to you? You've been on my ass for six months to try to get on Maxie's list. Now here we are. Because I never fucking even met this fucking Ruiz guy. I got no idea what the fuck I'm dropping off or who the fuck I'm fucking picking up. Or what the fuck I'm supposed to meet. And fucking Maxie's still pissed at me because I fucking sold his carpet cleaning van. Sold? I thought you said they stole it? I sold it. I stole it. What the fuck difference does it make? Oh, motherfucker. Don't make it like you feel fucking bad for that fucking guy. Give me a fucking break. I vouched for you. Look, relax, okay? Relax. You don't fucking get it, that's what fucking bothers me. You fucking have the wrong idea to feel bad for that guy. Because you know that fucking Max fucks all the fucking girls that work for him as strippers. And I'm saying, if there's one guy not to feel fucking bad for, it's him. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Listen to me, before you fucking do anything. - I'm just saying... - Where did you fucking hear that? That I fucking heard that he fucks girls. What the fuck are you trying to tell me? I'm just saying, I heard he fucked them. I'll protect myself. Come on, take it. Fuck you, motherfucker. Get the fuck off me. Yo, Bobby. - Well, do you know this guy here? - Yeah, his name is Horrace. This is Ricky Slade. Ready to meet Ruiz? Fucking embarrassing. I gotta ride down the street, the whole fucking neighborhood. The guy doesn't have a fucking shirt on. Be a man. Come on. - Those fucking people looking at me. - Suck it up. Come on. No, man. No. It's too risky. I want out. Listen, man. We made a lot of money on this one together. But it's over. Shit's going down. I'm selling my end. This Internet shit is entirely too volatile. I'm gonna take my block of Microsoft. Yeah. I don't care what problems they have, that nigga Bill Gates is a bad motherfucker. Yeah, and I'm gonna take my profits on Yahoo and all the portal stocks. Yeah, the bubble is gonna pop. All right, then. Peace. That's it? This is Maxie's cavalry? Now, who the fuck swole y'all up like that? No one... Well, we had a thing with each other. I gotta tell him. He asked me a question. Sit your asses down. Thank you, man. It's good to meet you. If this shit don't beat all. Maxie done sent me two broke ass, swole up guineas from LA. I could've hired some local guineas with some beer money. - Ain't that right, Leo? - Sure. - You boys want anything? - Yeah, bring us four Fernet. - Four Fernet. - No thank you. Actually, I'll have a Strega, please. What, motherfucker? You drinking the witch after dinner? No class. Look, there's absolutely no reason to start name calling. It's midnight and this motherfucker's ordering an aperitif. Actually, with all respect, Ruiz, Strega, that is a digestive. Strega is an aperitif. Sorry, Leo. I'm gonna get up out of here, man. What do I owe you? - It's on the arm. - Thanks a lot. Love you, man. You need anything, you give me a call. - Thanks. - All right. - You rode? - 900, baby. Big boy. Jimmy, Ruiz. Come to Luna, pick up Maxie's guineas and bring them to the spa. Yeah. Right now. Jimmy's gonna bring the car around. Me and Horrace, we rode the sledge. Y'all gonna meet us at a spa, in the VIP room. - Don't get lost. - I don't know where this spa is. 13th Street, man. Jimmy knows. Just be cool, man. Fuck him. Who the fuck is he to call me a guinea? - What do you care what he calls you? - A guinea. What is he, your friend? Okay? Let's just get this shit done with and go home. He's not my friend. Do you think this is the drop happening now? I don't know. I don't know anything. I mean, you think if it was the drop, it's happening now, - they'd tell us that, right? - Yeah, one would think that. So I'm under the impression it's not the drop. It's probably not, but I don't know. - Okay. - I don't know what we're doing either. Taking a time out from you, Jimbo. That's not cool. I don't want him fucking looking at me. I don't want him to think that you're fucking blowing me. You're so fucking weird. Excuse me, honey. I'm on the list. I'm on the list. Excuse me, sweetie. I'm on the list here. What's up, bro? How you doing, man? Sorry, sweetie. I'm on the list here. Yeah, I'm on the list. - Ricky Slade. - You see a Ricky Slade? Cardiff Giant. Maybe check that. - What? - Cardiff Giant. Just check the list. Cardiff Giant. Maybe you want to try the China Club. Again with the fucking China Club. What do I look like, a fucking Persian to you? Hey. I'm half Lebanese, man. Okay, look. We're with Ruiz. Okay, is Ruiz... Ruiz isn't here. You might want to check the list. We're supposed to meet Ruiz here. He might have put our name on the list. Ruiz is always on the list. He's not here, though. Okay, you might want to check if he's here 'cause he specifically set up for us to meet in the VIP area. - He's not here. - Well, I'm on the fucking list. Hey, what's up, man? - Excuse me. Could you just check... - What's happening? Hey, what's up, man? How are you? - All right, bro. - Hey, man. How's it going? You look big, man. You been lifting? Thanks. Yeah, a little bit. I got a six-pack. Started out with a 40. - All right. - You look good, man. - Thanks, man. Catch you later. - Cool. Did you see that shit? Did you just let Screech in the fucking club? I'm waiting in line, and you just let Screech in the fucking club. - He's on the list, man. - Show me the list. I want to see on your fucking list where It says that Screech is on the fucking list. - Show me fucking Screech on your list! - Get your hands off me. Get the fuck off. - Hey! Shut the fuck up. - Get the fuck off me, boy. We'll fucking throw your ass out of town. - Who, you and Screech? - Yeah. - You and Screech? - Yeah, me and fucking Screech. - Hey, what's happening, bro? - What's up? - How you doing, man? - What's going on? - You look big, man. You been lifting? - A little something. - All right. - What's up, Rich? What's up? It's popping in there, man? Oh, man. Big time. Big time. Hey, these two say they're with you. - Yeah. They're with me. - I'm with him. All right. These two are good. Sorry. Next we have a very, very big group... All right. Over in the corner. That's him. - Y'all know the drill, right? - What drill? I don't know any kind of drill. No one's told me anything... Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right? What, are we working now or something? What the fuck you think, I want to hang out with you motherfuckers? Yeah, you working. And put down the goddamn champagne. The lady just brought the champagne for the whole table. For all she knows, you John motherfucking Gotti. Put down the champagne and act like you been here before. You better get this shit straight before I get back. Is he making a drop? Nah, he's making contact. That's the Welshman. What's his name? Ruiz don't like to use names on cell phones, so he calls him the Red Dragon. But that's just between us. On the low. When is the drop? To be honest with you, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now. How do you know it's not drugs? Because Maxie know I ain't doing no more cocaine time, and it ain't now because Ruiz didn't tell me it was now. - So shut the fuck up. - All right. All right, man. - Are you strapped? - What, motherfucker? - It means, are you carrying a gun? - I know what the fuck "strapped" means. What's up with this 21 Jump Street shit, man? Yo, this is my boys right here. - How you doing? Bobby. - The rogue's gallery? Bobby. This is Horrace. - This is Rick. - Hey. You must be the Red Dragon? The name's Tom. Yeah, so where's the Red Dragon's lair? Where do you call home? Where do you lay your head down? Home? Home, Glasgow. Glasgow. Yeah. And where exactly might that be? - That's Scotland. - Scotland? How come the word on the street is that you're Welsh, my man? There's a buzz going around about you being Welsh. Enough of the introductions. I want you to meet somebody. You like big titties, right? Yeah. Love big titties. Yeah. What the fuck was you told? - Don't talk, right? - Unless spoken to, Ruiz. Isn't that right, Horrace? You know that to be true, as well. Don't fucking bring me into this shit, man. Look, he spoke to me. Okay? What do you expect me to do In a situation like that? Just dis him? Dis? Dis? Let me tell you something, motherfucker. You're in no position to dis or give props, or whatever your MTV, Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're a fucking amateur. You wasn't sent here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he's from. And who the fuck told you "Red Dragon"? You fat motherfucker. We get it. We're sorry. Fuck that sorry shit. Y'all fucking up my money now. Now that lying, mean motherfucker's all uptight. Shaky and shit, trying to change shit around on me. That's a fucking problem, fellas. I'll tell y'all right now. Maxie's gonna shit a Nokia when he finds out about this shit. Fuck, I better call his ass before he finds out about this shit. You're fucking up my money now. I don't like my money fucked up. - I'll catch up with you later. - Shut the fuck up, you fat fuck! Well, that's one way to handle people. I'm not saying shit to neither one of you motherfuckers. - What? - Shut the fuck... What did I say that was so fucking bad? The Red fucking Dragon, man! Why is that bad? Why, why? What the fuck did I say that was so fucking bad? How bad is the situation? - How bad is the situation? - It's bad, man. Ruiz already said that you were fucking Maxie's token goons and not to be trusted. He wanted to do the shit all by himself. I was gonna ride shotgun, keep the fucking English dude aboveboard. Now, this fucking bull? Oh, my... When's the drop going down? It was supposed to be tomorrow, but who the fuck knows now. Ask the Red Dragon when the drop is. Look, if it's gonna make everyone happier, I'll tell him I fucking heard the Red Dragon thing from somebody else, okay? All right? I'll tell him I heard the Red Dragon from someone else, man. All right, you know what... We don't want to talk, we want to scream at people. But we don't want to listen or problem solve. And that's what's frustrating about the fucking dynamic of the group. Are you happy? Am I fucking happy about what? Why do you have to make everything so fucking difficult? - Don't fucking come at me, too, please. - I'm gonna come at you, too. You're like a fucking bull in a china shop, man. - Fuck this shit. - Where you going? Lookit, Bob. Work is over. I'm gonna go in, have a good time like a gentleman, have a drink. You're welcome to join me, but I'm not gonna sit here and be negative. Not in there. They know you're with Ruiz. You're damn straight they know I'm with fucking Ruiz. That's why I'm going back in. Fuck you. Go. I'm taking the fucking car though. Fuck you. Fine. Take the fucking car. I don't give a shit, you fucking sissy. Where to? Wait here. Seriously, I've had a lot of fun tonight. You having a good time? You were really dancing out there. That was some great stuff. I liked when you did like that. Hey, look who's back, my man. Grab a bottle, will you? Eat some of the fruity shit. It's good. I don't want any of this shit on Ruiz's tab. - Close Ruiz's tab. - You're damn right. Close the tab. But bring us two more bottles of Dom cham, okay? Hey, here's 50 bucks. Take this in case I get drunk and I call you a bitch later. I'm only kidding with you, but take it anyway. This is how I do it. I'm gonna do it all night long. You know what I mean, girls? Enjoy yourselves. I don't know him. I don't know him. Lad on the phone. Lad on the phone. Not fun at the club. His shoulder's been killing him all week. Can you give him a little on the shoulders? Just a... Yeah. He's been nagging and nagging. Oh, God. Someplace... Is there, like, a nice place? I don't know where we are. - Soho. - Soho, you're damn right. Let's go. - You all right? - Yes. - You sure? - I'm fine. - He's cute. - I'm fine. - Right? - He's all right. Should I fuck him? - If you want to. - He's cute and straight. He's honest. - He smells? - Smells like alcohol. He's all right. You want to fuck him, fuck him. You don't smell. You're nice. Yeah. So, a lot happening out here, I see. I see someone getting real comfortable in their kimono. Very comfortable, yeah. It's nice. What a nice surprise. Do you like surprises? I like surprises. - Because I got a surprise all ready. - For me? Yeah. I got a little surprise for you. Sure. Let's check it out. All right. This is a surprise built for one, though. I'm sorry. That's all right, honey. - I'm hanging here with... - You wait for me here. Homeboy. He always said I didn't go to the gym, but I work out. It's just I don't want to work out all the fucking time. - No, I hear you. - I don't want to talk about him. That's what I'm trying to do is not talk about him. Let's not argue 'cause we had such a nice time. We're not arguing. - Are you okay? Are you comfortable? - I'm so comfortable. - Seriously? - Don't laugh at my fool. - I have a corn on it. - No, that's part of who you are. Mind if I roll a joint or something? Is that all right with you? - No, I can't. - What the... What? I'm sorry, I just... Come on. Come on. We better go. What the fuck happened? What did he do? - What the fuck is going on? - What did he do? - We used to take baths together. - Oh, the bath. - I can't take a bath. I just can't. - Okay. Okay. - What? - Hi. John, can you pick me up? - It was really nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. You have a great Easter. - You, too. You, too. - I'm sorry about this. I'm sorry. She's bad. That's real fucking classy. I swear to God, the girl was fucking jonesing for it, the next thing I know, she fucking freaks out. Is everything okay? I heard a noise. Is everything all right? Ricky, I heard a commotion. Is everything okay? Everything's fine, man. I'm sorry. - They're complaining downstairs. - The mess is gonna be fine. I'm sorry. It was just a little bit weird. Oh, my God. This is a mess. They're complaining downstairs about... I'm sorry. Everything's taken care of. Everyone's leaving. - Are you okay? - Our last guest is leaving. I'm fine. I've had a rough night. I'd like you to leave me alone. - You look like you've been... - I just want to be left alone. I just... I'm fine. Thanks... I'd give you some money, I don't have it. You know how I do... Do you want us to bring up some... I just want you to leave the room, please. Why don't you get the fuck out of the room? I'm sorry. Just get the fuck out of the room. Can you get out of the room? Get the fuck out of the room. Hi, it's Bobby. Okay. Yeah, we're at the hotel now. Okay. Five minutes. We'll be downstairs. Where are we... Okay. So the driver knows where to go? Okay, we'll see you in five. - What's up, man? - Ruiz wants to meet with us right now. Where? Where did he say he wants to meet us? He didn't say. He said Jimmy knows where to go. I don't know. You know what the fuck that means. That means that we're fucking getting whacked. We're not getting whacked. Calm down. Then why the fuck wouldn't he tell you where the fucking sit down is? Who said it's a sit down? - It's fucking all going crazy. - It's not a sit down, man. He says we're gonna go over the plan. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. - We're gonna go over the plan. - What are you doing? I got a bad feeling here. Okay? I'm not going into this thing naked. What are you gonna do, you gonna shank him in the shower? Look, is it so fucking unrealistic to believe that Ruiz, who doesn't even fucking want us here, is gonna throw us to the fucking wolves as a fucking apology? I don't know what I'm dropping off, Bob. You don't know what we're dropping off. - I don't know where the drop is. - Let's not get ahead of ourselves. We haven't had any sleep. Now, let's just keep our mouths closed and not make any mistakes. I'm gonna go upstairs. You go throw on some clothes, all right? Let's get downstairs in five minutes so that we're not late and make things worse. - Can you put that thing out, please? - Come on, man. I swear to God, I'll fucking puke. Put it out. Hey, Jimmy. Where are they taking us? Yeah, where are they gonna whack us, Jimmy? They're whacking you, they're doing it in style. Jesus Christ, where y'all been all night? You look like shit. - Good morning. - You motherfuckers. "Good morning." - You think this shit is funny, Horrace? - No, I'm just saying... You think this shit is funny, motherfucker? - All I said was... - Easy, Ruiz. Don't "Easy, Ruiz" me. You turned an Easter egg hunt Into a butt-fuck-athon. Give me four eggs benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas? No, thank you, man. I don't think I could eat anything. Four mimosas. You'll love them. All right, now, Tom, the Welsh dude, he don't do nothing but dabble a little bit. He's small-time. Maxie had me hook up this loan with him through an Austrian passbook account. Now we're talking money laundering. Would you tell Peter Jennings to shut the fuck up and listen? So, Ruiz, what do you want from us? What do you need us to do? - Come here. - Yeah. Now here's the plan. Take the money to the Welshman. He's gonna check it. He's gonna hand you his marker and you're done. That's it. As long as you hand off the bag, you're tight. All right. When is the drop? Now you three, y'all are gonna set up dinner with him. There you're gonna find out if and where. Anything else? So who's gonna outfit us for this thing? Outfit? What the fuck is he talking about? Ruiz, I realize you're gonna want to have me strapped in case there's a situation... Strapped? The last person I want with a gun is you. Please don't give this motherfucker no gun. This is as routine as it gets. I could've turned it offshore within a week. But Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I could've dropped the bag myself. It's only 200Gs. But he sent you two. So I could either call Maxie and tell him how you fucked up, send your asses home, or we can flush it down the toilet one more time and see if it all goes down. Look, man, all we have to do is meet the fucking Welsh guy. Make him feel comfortable. Do whatever it takes. Drink some tea with him or whatever. Whatever the fuck they do in Scotland, or wherever the fuck he's from. Make him feel comfortable till he brings up the drop on his own. We make the drop, you're on a plane back to California fucking hos on Melrose. When's this meeting? 6:45 at the Globe. Park Avenue. 6:45. 6:451 6:45, motherfucker! - We need guns. - We don't need guns. I'm telling you, man, I'm pretty sure we need guns. I listened to them and they specifically said that we do not need guns. That's all the more reason why you do need a gun. - You couldn't even get a gun. - You wanna bet? Wanna bet me if I can get a gun? You couldn't even get a hand job from the bridge-and-tunnel posse. That's because that fucking girl had personal issues with the bathtub and the other thing. Now float me 100 bucks. - Why? - Want to see how fast I can get a gun? What happened to your money? - I have it. I have some stuff left. - How much money do you have left? - I got like 80 bucks left. - 80? - 85. I got five in the room. - 85 bucks? What happened to the 1,500 Maxie gave you? Well, you could've picked up a fucking tab once in a while. I paid for half the fucking drinks. Shut the fuck up. Fuck you, motherfucker. Don't do it to me... Watch it, boys. Watch it, watch it. - Sorry, ma'am. - Let's go. Yes, okay. Be careful. Now, look at that. They're all standing up for us. They look as though they're going to a wedding. Okay, look. Can we calm down, please, and just try to talk about it civilized? And have a discussion? All I'm saying is, I vouched for you, Ricky. And you fucked me. This is peanuts compared to what we're gonna make down the road with Max. I don't want to make money down the road, okay? This is it for me. I want to take this money so that Jess doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections to put her kid through private school. You're my friend, and I know that you stuck up for me to be on this trip, and I respect that, okay? I'm sorry if I've caused you problems. But I see things that I don't think that you're seeing. All I'm saying to you, I'm not mad at you, okay? It just could've been so easy if we had handled it differently. - That's all I'm saying. - Let's go home. We get some sleep, we're gonna feel a lot better. We can't sleep. We got three hours at most. That's why we should probably spend this time getting guns. This is the way you fucking think. You get crazy. We don't want a gun. That's gonna get us killed. Okay, Bob. You knocked the Jew's tooth out. That's gonna cost Max 8 grand. Maybe more than 8 grand. You probably lost him his whole line of clientele, too. Plus you've been fucking up Jess' dancing. Now, I think he knows I sold the fucking carpet van. He's been giving me looks and shit which leads to that, okay? Now he can't kill us in Los Angeles. 'Cause there's a lot of questions there, right? But all of a sudden, he flies us out to New York City, do a drop. We don't know what the fuck the drop is. Okay? But if we disappeared out here, there's no fucking questions involving that. There's no questions if we disappear. LA questions, drop out here, a lot of questions. How do you come up with this shit? - Bob... - You're fucking... You're loose. I'm loose. I'm loose. I know, I'm always fucking loose. Here's scenario B for you, Bob. See how you feel about this one. Now I don't know if you've noticed this or not, but I think I'm starting to get under Ruiz's skin as well. Okay? It all started with the whole Red Dragon. The Welsh guy, whatever. They can play it down all they want, but you know 200 grand is a lot of fucking money. That's a fucking lot of money, okay? 200 grand is definitely a lot of fucking money. And now I got Ruiz, along with fucking fruit pie the fucking magician, telling me that I can't fucking call my main man Max, who fucking sent me out on the fucking operation. What about the Welsh guy? He's fucking scattered all over. They fucking disappear and talk. And you haven't noticed this either, when he's not fucking looking at me, or you're fucking doing whatever, I got fucking Jimmy in the mirror with this shit, too. It's fucking coming at me from here. I don't know where it is. It might be coming this way, It might be coming that way, but the fucking shit's coming, and I'm not gonna be late for the fucking dance, man. I'm not gonna be fucking late for the dance on this one. You're not getting a gun. We're getting all together. Tell me that's not a setup. - Hey. - Hey, Tom. - How's it going? - How's it going, Tom? - You're... - Bobby. Bobby, right. Right. - And you know... - Ricky. Ricky. Tricky Ricky. How you doing? The thugs, right? Want some tea? - Tea? - Yeah, tea. Tea, no. No. You want a drink? A drink? - You know what I mean, a drink. - I know what you mean. - A drink. - That would be nice. Get up, yeah. Yeah, you want some of this here? Taking your time. You're very slow, you American boys. You're a bit slow with the old fucking bevy, aren't you? You're a bit slow there. This is the greatest fucking party in the world. The place is bad. I love this country. I think it's fucking... You know what I love? I love the fucking breakfast in the morning. For breakfast you say, "Can I have some toast? "Some eggs, some coffee?" "How would you like your toast, sir? "You can have black toast, green toast, "white toast, fucking rye toast, Russian toast." I just want some toast. Just give me some fucking toast. I'm starving, you know? I love that. I love that. It's kind of why, when you go for breakfast, it's like a fucking night out. You know what I mean? It's great. For the business at hand. Anybody got any drugs? Yeah. What you want? I mean, what you want? How about Charlie, maybe. - Who? - Charlie. - You know... - Some blow. - Yeah, I can get you some blow. - No. No, blow, no. Charlie, you know, like coke, you know. Oh, yeah. We call... What you call it, Henry? We call Henry, blow. - Charlie. - Whatever the fuck his name is. - Charlie. - They all white. Yeah. They all white. Man, I like that very much. Yeah, yeah. I'll get you some coke. This here coke here is fantastic. Back home, you know it's... Here we go. Special delivery for you. Special delivery. Special delivery. Columbian munching powder. You ever call it that? Did you get it? Did you get it? That's great, man. Let's get this done, though. Because you know how it is. - These places get real busy. - God! - Sorry, guys. - That's okay. That's cool. That is a laugh, isn't it? Great times. This is great, guys. I really appreciate this, you know that? You guys are the best, you know that? These guys are sound. Sound. You see that? Mind if I go first? - No! - Looks like I went first. You went first. Jeez, listen. The white stuff, there's an awful lot left. - For me? - Yeah. Rather nice of you guys. - Fuck, that's good. - Thank you, man. Listen, come here. Let's say we make a go of this and you drop off the cash tomorrow. - That'll do it. - Okay. Look, here's what worries me. He wants to have this meeting at this bar in Red Hook. - You know where that is? - No. Brooklyn. - He must have that shit troughed off. - What do you mean troughed off? Troughed off, it means protected, like a fortress. Is Ruiz tied in out there? No. Bunch of Puerto Ricans and fucking Irish immigrants fresh off the boat. Hey. I'm half Irish. But you ain't this kind of fucking Irish. You ever heard of the Westies? - Yeah, I heard of them. - Them are some bad motherfuckers. They used to cut people's heads off, leave them on the bar, finish their fucking drink. That was like making a play against the Italians back in the '80s. I'm not fucking with those kind of motherfuckers. Sounds to me like everybody's just getting a little bit jumpy. Yeah, whatever. This Welsh guy, he's got nothing at stake. All right? This is just a drop. I say we go to his troughed off bar in Red Hook and we just drop off the bag, like Ruiz said, and get on a plane and go home. And not a word to Maxie. Maxie finds out we crossed the bridge, he's gonna shit. Okay. Bobby, we're home. Come on. Wake up, wake up, man. We're home. Get some sleep. Let's go get some sleep. Hey guys. It's Uncle Bobby I'm gonna be home really soon. Bobby? Chloe? Uncle Bobby's gonna be home really soon. Can you come home, please? - I love you. -Yeah, I love you, too, baby. I gotta go. I just want you to be here. Everything's going as... Yeah. Everything's going as planned. If anything changes, I'll call you. - Where's Ricky? - Ricky's taken care of. - How so? - He's gonna meet us out there. Let's ride. - Where's Ricky? - I don't know and I don't give a shit. Let's just take care of this. A friendly group. Thank you. We haven't even done anything yet. Thank you very much. Enjoy yourselves. Welcome to Wheel of Fortune. Glad to have you with us. And you folks at home, you figure out the preview puzzle? Let's take a look, see if you were right. What do we have there, Vanna? It's European vacation week, featuring some great cars. We have trips to the Riviera and to Germany, London and Spain, and of course, $25,000 cash available every day. Do you all know that puzzle? Okay. This is Christy Johnson who's from Elkhorn, Wisconsin. Hey. Hey, guys. Hey. - How you doing? - How you doing, Bobby? - You all right? - Yeah. Sorry, guys. You know the... You know the deal. You know how it is. So... - Listen, you want a drink? - No. - I'm gonna pass on the drink, - No? Listen, where's your mate? Yeah, he won't be with us. But look, here's... Here's the money. Not to rush you. You give us the marker, we can be on our way. I'll have to count it, otherwise I can't verify the amount, yeah? Don't worry about that. Just write down that you took the delivery. Sure. Sure, mate. - Hey, hey. - Fuck, man! What the fuck are you doing, man? What are you doing? - Fuck, man! - Shut the fuck up! You fucking bastards. As far as any of you are concerned, a gang of spics took the bag, all right? Understood? Good. Now grab his fucking wallet. I only fucking hired these guys to watch my back, man. Will you shut the fuck up? Maybe you should shut the fuck up. All right. Steady, guys, take it easy. He's got six shots. He's bound to miss. What are you, an odds maker? You gonna work everyone through this thing here? Let me tell you something, fucko. If that motherfucker right there don't take that knife away from my friend's neck, I'll use all six shots to make sure you're dead. Now, do you believe it? Do you fucking believe it? Now I want everyone to drop all their bats and toys and... It's a starter pistol. - What? - His gun is a fucking starter pistol. I can see the red plug in your fucking barrel. Listen to me. I intentionally made this gun look that way because I am smart. And I don't want to draw... That's enough! That's enough. Come back here, Ho. Get over in the corner. All you guys. Get over in the corner. Drop your weapons. I said drop your fucking weapons. Get over in the corner. Over in the fucking corner! Take out your wallets right now. Put them on the table. Turn around. Turn around. Put your hands behind your head. Now get on your fucking knees. Get on your knees! Bobby, come here. Take that. Nice work, Bobby. I'll let Maxie know you're good in the pocket. Go home. You know, you boys did good. I never intended to test you to such an extent, but you come through. I could've used a call. - Ruiz said not to call. - I'll take that up with Ruiz. - You got the money, though. - The money come through. I could've used the call. As for you, Ricky, you're a draw. That's gonna go to a new carpet cleaning van. Maxie, I walked into a room full of fucking Westies for that money. If they were Westies, you'd be dead. - Max, that's not the point. - We're square. As for you, Bobby, your days of fighting for crumbs are over. Take a week, come back. We'll talk about the next thing. I don't think there's gonna be a next thing, Max. Take a few days. I don't need a few days. I'm through, and Jess is through dancing for you. Yeah, well, I hate to... I hate to break up your fantasy dream or whatever the fuck it is. But I've been paying Jessica's rent for eight months. Thank you for the opportunity. I'm gonna be leaving now. Oh, gosh. A lot going on. But there always is, isn't there? A lot going on. Gotta tell you, I am sure glad that that fucking carpet cleaning van is out of the way. It was hanging over my head for too long. Now Bobby can be a little hasty sometimes. You said what to him? Wait a few days. Smart. Let's let him wait a few days. I'm gonna go ahead and hold onto this for him. Keep your hands off the money. - I want to... Maybe he'll... - Don't touch the money. Okay. I'll leave the money right there. - My point being... - Get the fuck out. Understood. But if he changes his mind, can he come... Get the fuck out. Okay, okay, okay. Nice to see you. Asshole. Just checking on the girls. I'll be right out. Chloe? Where's Mommy? - All right. It's yours. - That's enough. - You're... - I just... Why don't you get your shit? I never promised you anything, okay? How could you let her see you like this? Bye, Bobby. I bought you out with Max, in case you want to leave. - I don't want to leave. - You do what you gotta do. But that little girl out there is such a special person. - Take her. - What? Take her. Hey, Chloe. I just talked to your mom and she thought that, you know, it might be a good idea, that if for a little while, maybe you and me went on a trip someplace. Okay? Is that okay? All right, we're gonna go now. All right? Okay. Here's Ricky. - Hey, baby. How are you? - Good. - Yeah, you feel good? - Yeah. I don't think they were expecting me. Sorry, man. She doing okay? - I think she's hungry. - Yeah. Wanna get something to eat? We'll get the seatbelt on you, okay? Wanna go color some things? Frogs? Leopards? You all right, man? - Me? - Yeah. You sure? Oh, yeah. I'm all right. - You okay? - I'm okay. - You should be okay. - I'm okay. - You should be. - I'm okay. Good. - Don't ask me if I'm okay again. - I'm not asking you. - Let's just get some food. Okay? - Let's get some food. I'm not okay. Did everyone get cake? Yeah! Everybody who got cake say happy birthday to Chloe. - Happy birthday, Chloe. - Grab your toys and do your thing. The big people gotta talk now. Everyone's reading the same stuff. At six, seven, it's different reading material. That's an age we want to get them going somewhere. I listen to the counselor. And he said that she tested exceptional. - Yes. - So I'm saying, let LA pay for it. She said that the public-school system with the magnet schools and everything will take care of everything. - I understand what a magnet does. - I don't mean to condescend. But you do, in a way. If worse comes to worst, we send her to private school. It's fine. We don't want to spend $10,000 for her to learn how to color. If you're on this side of the hill, she can go to regular school. It's easy when you're at work all day to come home and say you shouldn't watch MTV, but you deal with it for eight hours. There you are. Where were you five minutes ago, buddy, when the kids were going crazy? Now you show up? Okay, mousy. I'm trying to do a little business here. Go run around the parking lot or something, will you?
