Present a film by Jacek Borcuch LASTING You're so dirty. - Hi. Good morning. - Good morning. Is Michal still asleep upstairs? Yes...? I don't understand. Is he upstairs? Yes, yes, upstairs. Could you call him? - Yes, yes. - Thank you. - Michal...? - I'm coming. Coming, coming... You can't even imagine what happened this morning. - What? - Clara called. She said they're bringing grandpa because they have to go somewhere. And he needs to be taken care of. - Grandpa Miguel? - He has a cold. And who's going to do that when everyone's out in the fields? Me! Relax, I can help. That's not why I said it. It's like they don't know that the harvest has started. Really, I can visit him from time to time. He doesn't like you. He doesn't like anyone. I like your girl. What girl? Your girl. Me too. I wouldn't have jumped. There's no guy in the world I'd jump off a bridge for. I thought so as well. But he jumped, I was just holding his hand. It was amazing. I was screaming like crazy. And him? He was screaming as well. It was his first jump too. At least you lost your virginity together. Yeah. And it was better than the first time. Sure... It gets better with every time. I hope so. Talk to her, she likes you. What's the problem? I've already been nagging her about the motorbike, you know. I don't want her to think that I always want something from her. Tell her I need to go for something, I don't know... Invent something. I'll leave in the morning and be back by evening. Can't you go on the motorbike? I'll go back to Poland on it, you'll see. Let me know when you're leaving, I'll notify the breakdown truck so you won't have to wait long. - Do you want to bet? - What will I win? Karina? - Do you want to win her? - Are you afraid? What will I win? Nothing, you won't make it as far as Valencia on that piece of shit. What are you going to do with her, tie her to a tree? Do we have a bet? But she's racist. You're like a nigger to her. - What? - You heard me. Seriously? Are you fucking kidding? You're fucking kidding. Will you help me with the car or not? I'll think about it. I'll work on it a bit. It'll be fine. I guess it was that fucking genius... The aunt's second husband, remember? He was killed in that collapsing house. I told you. He got drunk, he filled it with diesel instead of petrol. When it didn't start he got annoyed and just left it. And it's been laying here all this time. Is he the one they're bringing here? No, you're not listening to me. They're bringing the grandfather. Miguel. And I'm talking about the one that... Whatever. Look. Can you see? This motorbike is one of its kind. Look. You see this? The handlebar and wheel turns but the light shines straight ahead all the time. Is that good or bad? Actually, not good, but it looks nice. You look nice. I really fancied him, the blond guy. He was German or Swedish, I don't remember. I couldn't understand anything he said, but he talked a lot. He kept rubbing his belly suggestively. I thought he was flirting with me. - Maybe he was hungry? - No, it wasn't that. Poor guy, he lost his dick in some accident. He was so lovely, but he was telling me all about it and I thought he was hitting on me. It was horrible. So actually he was an ass, he just met you and he already told you the story of his cock. Poor ass. Poor guy. I guess he's still somewhere... But what kind of life is that, my dear. Exactly! And it's not funny. Grandpa, why are you so serious? I haven't heard you laugh even once. Isn't there any wine for this old guy? - Pour him some wine. - No, he can't. - Why not? - Because he can't. The doctor banned it, he said it quite clearly. But if you want to hurry your way to the grave, you know what to do. I prefer the grave than listening to you, dear. So, an old man visits you and you won't give him wine? Pour him some wine, woman. Don't be so boring. I'll tell you one thing, Elena. Do what you want, but the doctor came two days ago... Listen to me! The doctor came two days ago and banned him from drinking. Your call. I saw the doctor six months ago and he didn't say anything about not drinking. Six months? Two days! - You've got it all wrong, dear. - No, you do. Look in the mirror and you'll see the face of a drunk. Pour him some wine, woman, he'll be fine. - No, he doesn't even have a glass. - Here you go! Here's the wine. - You're going? - Yes. - Goodnight. - See you tomorrow. Goodnight, sleep well. - Safe journey tomorrow... - Thank you, goodnight. - We should be going to bed as well. - Yeah, you're right. Wanna ride? The middle star in the handle, one of those three... - Can you see something next to it? - No. Well, then look again. OK, next to that middle one? OK, yes. There is a tiny star there. But below it or above? Just above, sort of on the left. - But you do see it? - Yeah. I know it's there, but I can't see it. What can't you see? I know exactly where it is, but I can't see it. - That tiny star there? - My eyes are too weak. In ancient times this is how people tested eyesight. It divided people into those who saw it and those who didn't. And you really can't see it? A moment ago you didn't even know it existed. I thought you might feel like this. Thank you. My father says that it's the best in the world. I told him that. I didn't think you'd remember. I remember everything. They've introduced prohibition for you. They can go fuck themselves. What are you doing here? What's wrong? It's private property, that's what's wrong. I didn't know. You know it now. I was diving. I've been here before but I haven't seen any signs. Are you looking for something? I said already, I was diving, there are lots of caves here. Get the fuck out of here. Are you deaf? Calm down, I haven't done anything. You've trespassed on somebody's property. - You're a fucking thief. - I didn't do it on purpose. Didn't you see the sign? I didn't see it. I didn't do anything. Why are you so aggressive? Because I fucking feel like it. This is my property. I don't want any problems. I'm getting my things and I'm going. What things? My motorbike and my equipment. It's my land, my property, and everything here belongs to me, it's mine. The fact that you're rich doesn't give you the right to judge people and steal from them. I'm not going to repeat this. Get the fuck out of here. OK, I'm gone. And now I'm going to let the dogs out, and they'll make Carpaccio of your ass. What happened? I've found the papers for the motorbike. How did you expect to ride it without them? I forgot. You're completely irresponsible. Is Karina going back with you? I haven't told her yet. What are you waiting for? I wanted to talk to you first. Come on, go and tell her. You're just confusing the girl. What happened? Do you want me to come with you? No, I'll manage. And you need the money. Do you want to tell me something? Michal, what's going on? Nothing. I can see something's wrong. You'll suffocate me. OK, bye! Is everything OK? Not really. Hello. Marta? Can I sleep at your place? It's OK. Good morning. - Good morning. - I'm looking for Professor Ekiert. She's not in her office. Do you know where she might be? She has classes now. With the third year, until 13:30. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I don't care. A year off because of what? Because you don't know what to do with your life? Everything is here. You have all the excerpts you need and the library slips already filled in. You just need to pick them up, you'll manage. Unless I'm mistaken. We didn't have this conversation, do you hear me? - Hi, dad. - Hi. I have something for you. Look. I found it in Valencia in the market. You can put it on your key ring. Thank you. It's great. You have to pay me for it. It's sharp, right? What? Yesterday I saw there's a crack on mum's grave. Yeah, I know. I was planning to order a new one, but it was too expensive. They're going to polish it and it should be OK. You look like you haven't been sleeping. I'm pregnant. Yes? I've left. It doesn't matter. What do you want? About what? No, it won't be. What do you want to talk to me about? About us? But you're only thinking about yourself. Leave me alone. I was... thinking to myself that, actually, it's not that bad... to be a granddad. What's this? A microscope. Does it work? Of course. Who is this boy? - Have you told him? - No. No? Why not? I haven't got the strength. You don't have the strength? Is that him? Michal? Why aren't you answering it? Did he do anything to you? Mum was maybe two years older than you are. I don't know what to say to you. Do you love him? Hi. Karina. We need to talk. You know that. Where are you going? Will you talk to me for a moment? - I can make it, you hear me? - I'm not interested. Only one word. - Just give me one word. - Shit! Is that OK? - Wait a moment. - Fuck off. I didn't want it. I don't fucking care. Are you deaf? You fucked up my life. - Wait. - Do you know what that means? I don't want to wake up in the morning. I don't feel like doing anything. Wait. How could I not tell you? Was I supposed to tell no one? Don't drag me into your problems. I can hardly cope with my own. What happened? What was supposed to happen? I didn't kill anyone. Not yet. What are you talking about? Tell me. Don't you see that all this doesn't make any sense? That we can't go on like this? What do you want from me? - Let me go. - I killed a man, do you understand? Don't touch me. I'm begging you. I didn't want it. What if you get mad at me, are you going to fucking kill me as well? Why would you say that? I didn't want this. I didn't want it to be like this. Michal, look at me. I'm twenty. Do you see how I look? I can't help you. Do something, I don't know, meet people. I have a game next week. Will you come? I've got an appointment with Doctor Brzezina. Karina Sobanska. Fine, go upstairs. You'll have to wait a moment, the doctor is with a patient. The baby is fine and healthy. Listen. You need to consider the fact that the same things seem altogether different to us during the day than they do at night. During the day the world is safe, rational, bright, visible. Night-time is of course the opposite: A dark, invisible reality, devoid of colours and shapes, populated with creations of the inside world. Usually bearing no resemblance to the actual state of things. From the psychoanalytical point of view night is the realm of the unconscious and day of the conscious. For our next meeting please finish reading the chapter entitled "Coloration" noting in particular the multitude of characteristics of sadness. Thank you very much. Hi! Hey, Michal! Hi. - You don't recognise people anymore? - I'm sorry. I'm rushing to the game. Pop in to see Karina, I think you need to talk. - I'm doing what I can. - Do more. - But tell me, has anything happened? - Please, call her. OK. But right now I'm really in a hurry. Listen, maybe... maybe you could persuade her and you could come to the game together? - OK, I can talk to her. - OK. It's at eight. Good, good. - What did he tell you? - He said goodbye. - He said it's his last game. - No fucking way. I wonder who's going to replace him now. Maybe Serafin. Someone saw him here a few days ago. The one from Warsaw? He didn't fucking win anything last season. - Bye. - See you. - Are we going to Ms. Ania's for a drink? - No, I can't tonight. I'm in a hurry. Michal... No man, no way. Take her for a walk or something. - Hi. - Hi. It's great that you came. Karina remembered. Are we going somewhere for a drink? I would gladly go but I'm already meeting someone. Bye, see you at home. Thank you for the game. Can I give you a ride somewhere? Home. Thanks for taking me home. I'm not an idiot, you don't have to talk to me like that. I have to go. Can I come in? Marta will be back soon. I've only told you. Maybe that's why you play better. I have to go. You didn't tell him? - No. - Why not? - I don't know. - You're a fucking idiot. Maybe later. Besides, he doesn't have to know. Fuck, I live with a moron, that's what I've got to say. I don't know if I want to have it. I'm not going to talk to you about that at all. What's so funny? My mother told me to call you since we haven't heard from you. She's worried. You left and you haven't given any signs of life. I've had a very bad time. Tell her I'll call her. Everything's fine. How's Karina? - Good. - Good? How about you? I've sent mother for a holiday, so I have to do everything myself. Good, you're preparing yourself for what you'll be doing in the future. I'm going to fucking sell everything as soon as I can, buy a house by the sea and eat meat. I'm sick of all this organic nonsense. It's good that she doesn't hear that. One day she'll have to but I don't care. - How's the motorbike? - No problems. I should hire it out, it would pay for my studies. Really? Is there anyone else apart from you who likes that thing? They say chicks like them. Pagan country... Are you smoking? My attitude towards organics has changed. I'm not going to tell this to my mother. She always holds you up as an example: Hard-working, honest, not smoking, not drinking. And look how you turned out. Hey, since we're talking, about the diving equipment... There's plenty of that stuff in the garage, is it still any use? I've met a chick that dives and I need to get the hang of it. Hey... Are you there? Hello! What if we don't find it? What, every copy has evaporated? There is no such possibility. I'm only asking. - Just in case. - Don't worry about that at all. How are you? How's things for you? Fine. Yes? And you're saying that to me so I'll leave you alone? Or something's changed? Things change with every minute. You know that better than I do. Don't philosophise just tell me if everything's fine with you. Fine... I guess. I'm not sure. You're not looking particularily radiant. Please, come in. Doctor... I don't know if I can have it. Are there any reasons why you can't? Family problems, I really can't have it. I don't know if you know but in this country abortion is illegal. Don't joke. How do you see that happening? Normally. How about we meet today? What's going on Karina? I can't reach you. Hello? Karina Sobanska... She was brought here two hours ago. - Where? - Ask on the first floor. Thank you. What are you doing here? - I'm sorry. - It's late. - There's no visiting at this hour. - Karina Sobanska, 20 years old. Please. Please. Karina Sobanska. Take off this helmet. You can go in but only for a moment, OK?
