THRESHOLD I always wanted to be a mum and when I was twenty-three, still in college I got pregnant for the first time. At that time I was only concerned about having a natural birth, Using a cloth nappy and breastfeeding. When I was a child I used to hate having an unusual name but later I learned to like it because it remained imprinted in people's memories. So I wanted to find a name that was neither so strange Nor so common. Attention XXII Century Free TV Spectators This is Violeta, who is on her way to becoming two months old Adolescence was so far away I couldn't imagine the magnitude of the changes that were to come. But the years passed and suddenly everything was different I felt lost, And I thought filming was the best way to understand what was happening. I would like to ask you about this film we are shooting What do you think about it? Oh, I don’t know. We haven't filmed often, so I don’t know what I think. I explained it to you the other day, didn’t I? What is this that I’m doing, why am I shooting. What did you understand from what I explained to you? You’re kind of studying... Autobiographical stuff, right? So you’re doing an interview It’s about you and you’re interviewing grandma too, And me, then we have three generations. And that's okay with you? - Being filmed, appear in the movie? - Yes. And why did you say that some things in the other recordings we did, That you didn’t like it? I don’t remember anymore. I think it’s more... I think it’s because... First of all, I was very ugly in those recordings. - No way, you weren't. Yes, I was. Secondly, because... I was going through very confusing times, I was... In one of them, I kinda said: “Oh, I’m non-binary”, Then again: “No, I’m not non-binary, I’m a man” Then, in the other one: “No, I’m not a man, I’m non-binary”. So... I kinda feel insecure, like: "Oh, this person doesn’t know what he’s talking about" "he keeps changing all the time” - I see. Ah... This was my most beloved book at that time. I used to love this book. It’s beautiful, it has amazing pictures. Look how beautiful it is. And that’s here where I found your name. One of the chapters is called Maira-Coraci. “Maira” means moon, and “Coraci” means sun. I had just returned from a... ... radical ... Jewish experience... because I had gone to live in Israel. I went to study History in Jerusalem. But I spent an important period At a kibbutz. The Kibbutz was a wonderful experience. In the 70’s, Early 70’s, a kibbutz was still a... Socialist society, almost communist. Still that Kibutz... in its original structure, without private property, Where everything was decided by the community, Where everybody worked on the land... For example, I worked in the corral, Milked cows at dawn And when I came back to Brazil Not immediately after, But a little later, I met this group, I was at USP (University of São Paulo), and I met this group of Cinema boys and girls. We were all left-wing people, We considered ourselves left-wing people, But no longer that left wing... We wouldn't take up guns, you know? We were not in the Communist Party, We were affiliated to the Workers’ Party... I think we also had... A desire to transform... Beyond politics, the way of life And we lived in a group, we lived in community. You were born in a community. And we experience a lot. And you experienced, our children experienced together with us. The whole period... In 77, 78 I was at USP. I was expecting you, I was still In my early college years, so... Somehow I think we... We went... Deep... Into the belief that another way of living was possible. And although we haven’t, So as to say, changed the system... I think we've done important contributions. I think... Your generation has greatly benefited Of the borders that we have broken through. To be able to make our choices, To have values less connected To money and more connected to achievement. Doing important things for the world. To understand... We went through the end of the dictatorship, The great demonstrations At Anhangabaú Valley... I remember you, At three years old, going to the “Diretas Já” (pro-election) rallies... We had you on our shoulders. Here, right? Because you were very small, in that crowd... Can you imagine the feeling of that moment? After twenty years of dictatorship, Being able to reoccupy the streets. I keep a fuzzy image of those days. In fact, I've heard this story so much That sometimes I wonder if I really remember, Or if I ended up inventing a memory. ♪ Opens wings that I want to pass♪ ♪ I'm a slut, I can't deny it Thirty-three years later, It was my turn to take my children to protest. ♪ Opens wings that I want to pass♪ It was the first time I ever shot a march, The first of many... ♪ Our flame is the fire of revolution♪ It was 2011, the feminism was on fire, ♪ Our fight is every day♪ ♪ We are women, not merchandise♪ And I immediately identified myself with the debauched And ironic spirit of the SlutWalk ♪ Who is not a sexist jumps♪ ♪ It's not about sex, it's about violence!♪ But at that time I couldn't even think That being a woman was not a biological determination... There’s a person here. A very beautiful one. There... For example... Here’s the genitalia, like A penis or a vagina, or something like that, There should exist more, right? Here is just a part of your body, Which you were born with or... What you do with it later, depending... On you, on your life, on what you’re going to do But this is not gender, it’s just a part of the body. Gender is here. That is where you... Feel, if you are a woman, Or a man, or... Whatever you are. And here is where the heart is, which is where you... Where sexual orientation is, which is who you are going to be attracted to. To men, or to women, or to both, or no one. Or if you don’t care if are a man or a woman, You only care about the person, Or if you are only attracted to a specific person, who you feel a connection with. This is all sexual orientation, Which has absolutely nothing to do with gender. You may be... I don't know, a trans lesbian woman, You can be a lesbian cis woman, You can be a cis bi woman, A trans bi woman... You can be any combination. One has nothing to do with the other, absolutely nothing to do with the other. So those who are trans suffer from transphobia, Not homophobia, because they have absolutely nothing to do... ...these two. Then there is, for example, I don’t know, your hair, The clothes you wear... Whether you wear makeup or not. All this is... ...the way you express yourself. But this here... And this... And this... There’s nothing to do. None of these determines this one. Now I like better some Masculine stuff because... Not necessarily because I don’t like feminine stuff, I like them. I also like masculine stuff, also... Now, I’m wearing a pair of shorts and a t-shirt but... It’s more a matter of how I’m going to be Understood around, by the world. Like, if I wear a dress and makeup, People will look at me and they will say: “Ah, you’re a girl” And I don’t want it. - And do you have any idea Why you wouldn’t want people to see you as a girl on the streets? Oh, because that’s not who I am, like... I don’t have... It’s not that... "Wow, I don’t want to be a girl, being a girl is bad and stuff" It’s not that. It’s too bad, because people get confused, like “Oh, you’re anti-feminist" "And you think being a girl is bad" "...so you don’t want to be a girl.” Like, it has nothing to do with it. It’s not that I don’t want to be a girl, I’m not, So it bothers me when people... Look at me... And talk... And they think that I am... I don’t know... - And do you have any idea of what you are? I don’t know. I really don’t know, it’s a very big issue, in my life, in fact. I studied literature, I was a dancer, I tried to play the saxophone, I wanted to live in Mozambique. I had many doubts in life, But it never crossed my mind to question whether or not I was a woman. What? Is it hot? It's hot. Let me open it a little bit. What a messy bath! Now it's chillier, look Wow, now it’s too cold. It’s too cold... Is it too cold? It is. Hey, this shower is crazy. No, I don’t want it. Why is it coming off the top? It's not too cold now - There's a fold there at... - There’s a fold at the outlet, you see? Ah... - Violeta! Do you know what time is? - What? - What Is it? What is it? It's when... Time is... It is when time passes. - And the birthday? When it’s my birthday, it's time, too. - How old are you turning? - Three? - And then? Seven! - And then? Nine! - And then? Six! I'm going to get big! - How big? - That big? - Is it too big? - Was your bath warm? Yeah! ♪ How can a living fish ♪ Live out of cold water? ♪ How will I be able to live? ♪ How will I be able?

Look... Hey, come here. look, dear, in the mirror. Everybody together. - An idea that was in my imagination... - Since I was a kid you used to talk about this - I've heard a lot about open marriages That were part of this questioning of the family that you were telling me about... Yeah, we did this experiment. Of having open marriages, right? We strongly believed in that idea of "Love and let love”. That jealousy was a selfish feeling... That we could have... Another experience A loving experience... in which the other was not your property, so as to say. And we were also marked by previous generations, Like Simone de Beauvoir, Who said that the official marriage, Formalizing marriage, signing a sheet, It was like bureaucratizing love. But the experience was tough, Because we realized that, In fact, jealousy existed And that, in fact, it wasn't easy to see your partner with another woman... And we quickly realized that, Sometimes, human beings are not what we want them to be, right? A lot has changed in that time... My student life was over, I ended a marriage, I got pregnant again, got married again, I gave up the Dance for good and started working with cinema In a short time my life was another one. And I wanted to bring a little detail, An element from my Jewish tradition. And wish you good luck. And the Jewish way of saying good luck is “Mazeltov”. And there’s a way To toast to this good luck. So, Julio, please... Break the glass, please. No, on the floor. Step on it! Really hard, really hard! Come on, Julio, hey! Push it! - But you know that your grandparents, Grandma Lena and Grandpa Adilson, when I was born... Well, they came from a generation where their parents, the women were Like, housewives, most of them, Very traditional families, you know? And they didn’t like it, they were questioning it all. And the way they found back then, in their hippie communities, to do so... It was the open marriage. Then, Ju and I... We married, we have this... We married “by the book”. A man and a woman, getting married, we decided to get married at the registry office, Doing everything that... (I’m looking at you through the lens). Doing all that, at first, seems pretty traditional. But we never really identified with The super-traditional marriage, too. We have always had a relationship in which we hook up with other people. Really? I didn’t know that. - With other women, together. You? Do you hook up with women? Really? What are you? I thought you were straight as hell! - No, I’m bi. I didn’t know, why didn’t you tell me these things? - Well, I’m telling you now. I thought you were too complicated with your own stuff - For me to tell you mother stuff. I didn’t know that, that’s cool! - I also think we can live this up and not talk about it a lot, right? - It’s a decision, like... - It’s serious, right? Making a movie where I’m going to talk about it, Then people will watch it... And we won’t.. Oh, nothing is a secret, but I never went out yelling about that, right? But I have realized that it is important, Exactly because of what you were talking about. I think it’s important... For us to talk about these things so they can become Natural, accepted by society. We have been seeing so many bad things happening nowadays Many of these rights.. On one hand I think in the society we are starting to get more openness.

A few weeks later I did an ultrasound that indicated: it's a girl. We believed it, chose another name, and I forgot the dream. When Martí was born, I didn't know what to name him. We had made a trip to Cuba, and Julio wanted very much to pay tribute to Jose Martí, the great revolutionary poet. This is Martí, Who has today 7,35 kilos, and sixty-two centimeters... At three months and a week. Look, son, look there. - Say something, son! Look at the camera! Only many years later I remembered that dream And realized the enormous coincidence. - Finished? Yes. - How did you come up with this song? At random. - Were you testing? Yeah. - Martí? - Can I ask you to explain something to me? - What happened to your brother in the last few months? I don’t know! - Is there any difference? What, about Violeta becoming Andre? - Yeah́. Hum, what’s that about? - Explain to me what happened, how did you see it happening. Violeta... André... Violeta. André. - Wait, again, again. Violeta... André... - Is this André? This Is André. - Is there any difference between them? André is cooler. - Do you remember when we had that conversation? - No? No. A few months ago... - A few months ago, right? Then, that time there Although it hasn't been too long Everything was different, right? For you, I guess. So explain what has changed from then on. After I've spent almost a year thinking about it By the end of last year, 2016, I sort of understood what my gender is. - And what is it? I am a boy. - And how did you come to that conclusion? Do you know how to explain? I don’t know how to explain. It’s because, like... I think I, kind of... I kind of knew it, but I thought I couldn’t be, because like, I’m not a very masculine person, right? I'm very feminine indeed. So I kept thinking that, because of that, I don’t know, I could not be... And because it’s not something I’ve always known Since childhood and such. I see these stories, everyone says that, "Since I was a child, I already wanted to wear boy’s things" and... One has always known... always wanted to be a boy. But for me it was much more subtle. So I thought... As if I wasn't allowed to think that Maybe I was a boy. Then, I I thought "No, that's bullshit". "I don't have to follow any rules to be anything". And then, I was thinking, I don't know how to explain it properly, but I've come to this conclusion. - I understood. And what's it like to be a boy? Ah, don't ask that, don't. I don't know how to explain. This is very subjective. There is no way to explain what it is to be a boy. - I understood. And what is it to be female boy? I mean to say I am not a macho man I like more "feminine" things - But then, in this case, could you not be a girl who is not very feminine? No, because, somewhat Because it really bothers me when a person... calls me by the other name, or say that I'm a girl, or uses a female pronoun for me and such. And I could not imagine myself Living as a girl in the future I could not imagine myself as a woman. And to be seen as a woman. - What is it to live like a woman? To live as a woman I mean... basically is to be seen in society as a woman. But you do not know how to explain because... - Because for me it is funny to understand What is so... ...problematic in being a woman. It is not problematic to be a woman. it's problematic for me to try to be something I'm not. And people see me as something I'm not. I don't know how to explain I think there is no way for you to understand, as a cis person - Got it. Sometimes I thought I should just accept, Sometimes I thought I should challenge... It's not easy knowing how best to handle a process like this. But I never wanted to be this mother who keeps doubting, Who doesn't trust, who doesn't understand. I always wanted to at least try to understand. About my family? I think my mom, She felt... A mix of admiration, Because we led a very free lifestyle And I think she understood that She admired that... She has always had so many ties in her marriages. She had to fulfill that role of a traditional woman... And she realized how free we were, right? And we set out to be free. So, on the one hand, I think she felt admiration. And I think on the other hand she felt concerns. Because she was very afraid of where all this was going to go. And I was not ...that nice with my family either. I was quite aggressive, I stood up for my way of life... And I didn’t allow them To come much... ...into our world. So, maybe they were even a little afraid of saying anything. I was very aggressive. I was difficult, so as to say. I was difficult to my mom, poor thing.... Nowadays, as I’m over 60 I can now better understand it. Understand her silence, Taking a backseat... But I also understand that it was hard for her. To have a daughter so different from her. As they say, a child falling away from the tree... I was the daughter away from the tree. Deep down I have always admired people who come out of a conservative family And manage to reinvent themselves, Create freer ways of living. I am lucky, my parents did that before me. Maybe that's why, at the same time that it was sometimes difficult to deal with Andy's process, I also admired his movement. I created a character who was Andy, He was a gay boy One of the characters in a story I had And when I was planning what his story would be, I'd end up making him look like I would if I was a boy, basically I kind of ended up accidentally Making him have the same interests as me The same kind of personality, those things And so I thought "Wow, am I drawing myself?" And I also think it suits me. And then I said, "Yeah, I like that name" "...to refer to me". - Got it. And why did you think I wouldn't like it? Cause you guys keep talking "Ah, it's American, gringo name..." "You only hear gringo music..." "Blablabla..." To detach myself from the name I had chosen so carefully Was one of the most difficult things. How cool, did it stick? Me too! Don't I look like you? It was in my memory of pregnancy, The cloth diapers, the first steps, The first words. The sleepless nights, the games in the park, The endless baths, the holiday trips. That name was not just a name, What were you going to tell, dear? I drew two flowers, one lion, one dog, two mountains, one house... It was a story. In 2017, it was Andy's turn to take me on a walk.

Black feminism. Queer feminism. Intersectional feminism. LGBTQI+ The movement I saw there had many names. I remember, after assuming myself as a trans boy, the first time I went out with friends. I got there And the first thing one of the boys said was... I went to greet people And the first thing one of the boys, David, did was to say: "Ah..." He slapped like that... and he said: “Now we have to say hello like a man, right?” And stuff... And I, like... Then they started treating me like that and I felt: “OK, but I don’t.... " "What? What’s happening? I don’t want it that way either” Then I began to feel uncomfortable as... Like, being seen and living like a boy. But, at the same time... It was also very uncomfortable living, being seen as a girl. And I’m feeling much better And with much less doubts by defining myself as non-binary and gender queer than trying to be a girl or a boy. And I think this generation of... Of my grandchildren... Is also a radical generation Is also a generation that is willing to break boundaries Trying things And they're experimenting with this gender thing It's not because I was born a girl That I need... like pink and Be a girl... all female.. No, I can try on... oh! Put on a man's outfit, See how I feel. I think it's cool... But I don't know... Sometimes I get a little scared because... What scares me is when I see some girls start taking hormone... start to... When I see body tampering experiments It scares me a little, you know? The desire to be who you are I think is cool, you know? If I was born in a woman's body But I feel like a man I feel like I'm a man I think it's okay I find it normal But mutilation of the body is still a difficult idea for me. But I can accept, I can accept, I think. If a person feels better that way, if they're up for it, right? I think it might cause me some pain to think About the muti... The changing of the body in that sense. But maybe for these people it's not a mutilation as I'm calling it. Maybe for these people it's a relief, “Thank god, I don't want those breasts" "I don't feel I'm a person who has breasts" Or a boy: "oh, I don't..." "I don't feel good having a phallus” Then fine, I'll never criticize. But personally it gives me a certain affliction Of who does this passage. For my mother the idea of "being natural" Had been an important dimension of the transgressive attitude. The naked body, free sex, Organic food, community life... All of this was part of the counter-culture movement Her generation undertook. I'm a little bit like that too. For me the birth control pill has always been a poison, And accepting my body has always been a quest. And then comes a new generation And turns everything upside down... The goal was not to portray this, but it is a character created To be somewhat androgen, like... Whose gender you could not tell that much There’s a trans man. Who I painted... That the trans flag is blue and pink and white. So I... Like, this was the first time I drew a picture that has to do with this. That kind... I don’t know... has the stripes here. But I think I’m going to get my most current notebook, Since it has more stuff about it. You asked me the other day, right? and I said I was surprised that there are so many people who really identify themselves as men or women... With so many ways that people can be, I am surprised that there are so many people who are male or female, with binary genders. This here is a trans person, I do not know well if he is a man or if he is non-binary You're not filming me anymore? I'm trying to make a shot that goes from me to you. But from down there? Yeah. Paint it, I'm just gonna do this test. For a while I lived a kind of grief over the name. So I decided to plan a ritual: I wanted to have a party with the whole family, the day Andy formalized the new name at the notary's office. I wrote a speech to read that day, A farewell letter for the name I had chosen. But I never did any of that, Because when I put it all down on paper, The feeling was gone. It' s still looking unfinished - Andy, you told me the other day that you wanted... Do one more interview. I thought it was nice, because it was the first time you'd ever said it. It wasn't me who called you. And then I want to know... The last time we talked, I don't know if you remember You had more or less recently Assumed the name "Andy" You had that purple hair And that was one day we went to a demonstration afterwards, remember? At night, downtown, and I was filming... More or less. - And then I think you called me because from that day until today Something's changed, huh? I think so... - About how you understand your gender... How are you seeing yourself these days? I'm seeing myself as a non-binary person, but like Considering a spectrum Between neutral and male Such as: female, neutral, male I'd be in neutral, but more drawn to male But I'm also caring less about Naming and shaping exactly what it is I'm trying to, kind of... I don't care so much anymore... ...to label it. - One thing I want to ask you, it was something that appeared quite recently... You’ve been telling me a lot about medical body changes. What do you feel about it? I feel that... Surgery, you know, here, I want to do... I’m pretty sure about this, because I’ve been thinking about it for two years, and I decided that I want to do it and kind of do it as soon as possible. Because it’s really a part of my body that I... It’s not that I hate it, but I’ll be better off without it. I’ll feel better and I’ll be able to live my life better without it. And I’ll feel much more “myself”. So I wanted to do this as soon as possible. And I want to... I’m still thinking. And I’m sure I want to do the hormone treatment. But I don’t know if I want to do it, like, for life Or just for a few months, until I get more androgen. I’m not quite sure about it, what I’m pretty sure about, is about the surgery. - But a surgery like that is... Yeah, but that’s what I’m thinking. - There’s no turning back, right? Yeah, but that’s what I’ve been thinking pretty much every day for two years. This is what I’m pretty sure I want. But did you ever think that... This feeling may change over time? No, it won’t. - When adolescence is over... and adult life comes in... other issues may arise, this could change... What issues, for example? - Other issues of life or a transformation Of your own feeling towards your body. - No, no. No, this I’m absolutely sure about, that’s really what I want. - I see. Well, anyway, there’s time, right? To turn eighteen, which is near... “Near...” - I personally think that... It is not bad at all to wait a bit and wait for these procedures to happen for you. I can’t be sure. You’re sure you won’t regret it, but I can’t be sure. Ah, I’ve been waiting for that for so long, I’ve been waiting every day. - I see... But for me, for my generation, This is still something that we have a lot of... Even those who, like me, don’t think this is absurd There are still many contradictions inside me, I think. Yeah, but I’m the one who has to know that, right? - Oh yes. Well, but you have to be of age to do it, so I don’t have to sign this paper. Yeah. - Because I can’t, Inside of me, I just can’t... If you come of age and do it, That’s okay, I’ll support you, no problem. But being responsible for signing this paper and authorizing you... There’s no way I’ll feel secure. I am dying of fear of doing this. I am dying of fear of repenting for having done this. Or of you repenting and accusing me of having allowed you to do it being so young, such a permanent thing... I do not have the courage of signing this paper... Knowing you, your story... I do not think I am entitled to, do you understand? For this reason I prefer you to be 18 years old and If you really do it, if you go after it and get it, You are going to have my whole support, as always to do and to recover, everything... But I am incapable of signing a paper authorizing you to do this. I am not able to, this way, I am not able to have so much certainty as you That you are going to think the same way you think nowadays for the rest of your life. It is that you also do not feel what I feel. - I do not feel what you feel but on the other hand I was a teenager once and I'm no longer, and I know how these things are... How we change throughout life... Over time I found myself in a dilemma. I wondered if it wasn't irresponsible, If it wasn't a mistake to prolong Andy's suffering with his body. I know what it's like to be uncomfortable with my body. I think everyone feels that way at some point in life. But I have no idea what it's like not to support my own body. The victory of the extreme right in the 2018 election was a shock, a nightmare, A mixture of panic and total incredulity. How much racism, machism, misogyny. Homophobia and transphobia terrified me. But we can't surrender to fear. Nor run away, nor hide. There's no turning back. There's too many of us and we want more. More freedom. More joy. More rights. More love. Since the last election I have often received a message that says: “No one let go of anyone’s hand” This film is a way of holding hands To Andy, but also For all those who share precariousness And who, with fear or courage, swim against the tide. This movie is a way of saying: "We're together". - Andy, say "hello, hello." Hello, Hello. - Again. Hello, Hello. How is the drawing you were going to show me? It’s a drawing I made that’s kind of like me, How I want to be, like that. Except that it is well stylized, It is not realistic at all. - Let me see it. And it’s not colored yet. Wait... I don’t know if the ink is going to run. - Don’t turn it completely, just open it, keep the page upright. - What do you identify yourself with in it? Oh, not to mention the style, which is how I dress, How the look that I like is... It is a more masculine way, with the beard, Here, stretch, too and... The face, you can’t see it because it’s stylized, but more masculine type and stuff... It is a goal, sort of. - Then, tell me, what’s about to happen? I’ll soon start the hormonal treatment with testosterone To do the physical transition. - So, how are you feeling? I’m very excited about that, I’m very happy. Did you notice that I changed my mind? Yeah, you weren't willing to allow it before, were you? You weren't willing to sign a piece of paper that would allow me to do so, That this was your responsibility, right? You were afraid I'd regret it and put the blame on you. - And why do you think I changed my mind? I think it's because you've seen that I've wanted this for a long time and I haven't changed my mind so far, so it's not a decision... You told me that, right? It's not a decision I made out of nothing, without thinking And because I' m doing the treatment at the Unicamp Gender Psychiatry Clinic Since the beggining of the year... So I've been doing all the procedures with professionals and such Then it's all safe and proper And you must also have understood how important it is for me to do that - I told you the other day that, although I’m going to sign, I still feel a little insecure, right? Aha. - I have some fears. What have you understood about my fears? That you think I might someday think that... I didn’t have to make a physical transition To live like myself. Is this it, basically? Yeah, that, too. Or that you would regret it. But I don’t think it’s going to happen, I don’t think so. - And what do you think of me having these fears? It bothers me a little bit, but also... Oh, I think it’s normal. That you feel insecure about it, Especially because you’re signing a paper and I’m quite young I think it’s normal for you to feel this way, even though I feel kind of... I don’t know... But... Oh, you’re not stopping me from doing that, right? You are quite respecting what́... I’m choosing to do, and that I’m taking responsibility for it and that I... Although I’m only seventeen years old. I can already know what I want. At least in relation to that. And that’s it. - I think today is going to be the last recording Are not you going to record me months into the testosterone treatment? - In relation to my PhD I don't think so... not specifically for this film because... Because I have to finish it and present my doctoral thesis... Ok. And I decided that at least this Expectation of yours and this moment of opening to a new phase Will be the end of the movie and the beginning of other things. I think the film is more about the process that led you to get up to this point. And not the process looking forward. First of all, show the paper to the camera Why are there two of them? Because I'm underage. So there's a consent form, Which is what you're going to sign... That my mother will sign. And this is the term of assent, I don't quite know what that means But it's just to say that I also know everything On the first two sheets they explain The effects testosterone has on the body Which are permanent and which are reversible If I stop taking it, what will stay forever and what will come back as it was before... What are the risks... What people say are risks but are not. For example people say that it can increase your risk of cancer. But it says that's not true, for instance. Says what I can't do and that I have to agree to carry out physical and mental health monitoring So I have to go to the psychologist, and I have to go and do some checkups to see if everything's okay if my body is reacting well. And at the end there's the signature field. If you are of legal age, or if it should be the parents. - Hold the camera for me, please. Don’t put the date, because maybe it needs to be Friday. - You can hold it like this, you don't need to hold here. You can hold it like this, and just stand still. How can I be sure I’m still? What? What if I tremble? If I kind of move, like this? - Then, there’s nothing to do, right? I’m going to sign your paper, huh? Especially for you and for the movie. Hold it here. - Is this the document you were expecting the most? The document is the prescription, right? But... Yes, basically. Thanks! You’re happy, eh? I’m so happy! I want to... to see the changes I’m going to go through... how will my voice be, how will my face be. It’s going to be very cool! The only problem is that it takes a few months, but it’s cool that you can see the changes little by little, noticing them. Are you filming me, I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.
