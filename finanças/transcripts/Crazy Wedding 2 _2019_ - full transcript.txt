YABLUNIVKA Repeated offender Seredyuk! Stop the car and surrender! Podillya never surrenders! Take this! Fire! Fire! Don't shoot! HAVE A GOOD JOURNEY A WEEK BEFORE Oh, Galya, what's this gallery? Don't you see? "The Seredyuks' Kids". No! The Seredyuks' kids and the traitor. There you go again, huh? Natalka ignored you just once and you stigmatized her for life! Once?! First, she didn't study culture. Second, she ran away to Kyiv! She became… what do you call it? - A PR-manager. - That's third! A person with neither a job nor future. And she could have taught at an art school by now. Yes, and would have starved. When were they last paid, six months ago? It doesn't matter! She disobeyed the wishes of her father who raised and cherished her. So put Francois' photo there instead of Natalka's. My son-in-law doesn't argue. You better make up with your eldest daughter. When did you last talk, 5 years ago? She gave up on the whole family because of you. I don't negotiate with traitors! Oh, you lost your daughter! How can one be so stubborn? Oh, Natalka, you were right not listening to your old man. Or you'd sit in the museum now guarding broken pottery. Yeah. I got mad at my whole family, too. I haven't even been to Katya's wedding. Well, you have a good life here, though. Salons-shmalons, spa-shpa… If you weren't renting a flat… I haven't been renting for three years. Have you bought one? I have a fiancée, you know. I moved in with him. Phew! I was about to have a heart attack. You're a sadist! Sadok vyshneviy, volokhaty… Kolo khaty. Kolo khaty. You had a year to study the whole "Kobzar" by heart! Here! You will whitewash the trees. Whitewash? Why? Not to let black bastards eat them. Oh, I mean bugs! I will build a sauna here. Beautiful, huh? Magnifique. If you agree, go ahead and grab the barrow. We'll cover it with rubble. Put the chopped wood over there. Come on. Oh, Catherine! Dad! Wasn't slavery abolished? How long are you going to exploit him? Have you complained to her, African French? We have a vacation. I didn't bring Francois here to toil. Yeah, right. He came here to have a rest and to breathe healing fresh air of Podillya. To eat organic food, too. Shall his in-laws do all the work? No. OK, Katrusia, if you don't feel sorry for your parents… Franik, have patience, it's your last chore for today. OK? Sure. He'll peel some potatoes, and that will be it. - Father, what happened? - I guess I strained my back. I work too much, and my health is deteriorating. Help me take my shoes off, son. I can't do it myself. Оh! - Is it OK? - Yes. It's much better now. OK, OK, that's enough. I'll manage. Come on, finish chopping. So, I won't stay unmarried for long. That's great. Yura, you said? Is he rich? Well, not as rich as your Ashot. But he is a businessman too. That's my girl, Natalka! Drive all losers away and get yourself a businessman! That's not what I love him for. He is very kind, sincere and has a sharp mind. And money, huh? Money, Miss Kryzhanivska, is just a nice bonus. - Natalka! - Huh? Have you got an extra pair of leggings? My leopard ones tore. Hello, bearded nanny! Don't yell. Gayane has just fallen asleep. I see you've turned into a housewife, Adamovych. Cleaning, doing laundry, working in the field… And now the babysitting! You are a housewife yourself. I just don't mind working. That's good. As you are scared of your wife and daughter… The matriarchy! - As if it's not the same in your family! - What? Vasyl Seredyuk's family lifestyle is nothing but patriarchal. - My word is law. - Ours is also… patriarchal. It's just not very noticeable. Yeah, right. Hello, Romanovych. - Hi there! - Taras, why didn't you wash the onesies? Well… I was watching Gayane… Yeah, right. OK, I am going to the hair salon. Wash the onesies by the time I am back. Got it? Told you. Even Ashot has no respect for you. What makes you think so? Well, he calls you by name, doesn't he? And my European son-in-law… Francois! Yes, Father? Do you need something? It's OK. Keep working. See, Taras-jan? It's patriarchy! Do you have your card in your phone? Look. Here's my trophy from the capital. - How do I look? - A real goddess. Just like at the prom. So? The hair's grey but the man can pay. Meet my future husband, Yury. Ah! I knew that! This is my school friend, Olga. She finally came to visit me in Kyiv. Nice to meet you. One can't miss girls from Podillya. Both front and back are pretty. And the glances you dart! Huh? Oh no, it's just my intracranial pressure has increased after that smoothie. Taras-jan, why don't you drink wine? It's expensive, you know. Listen, Ashot, can you stop calling your Father-in-law by name? Did you choke on coriander leaves? No, I am serious. Francois doesn't call Vasyl by name. Are you worse than him? - He is not. But his Father-in-law… - What? You can hardly find a man like me. I work hard enough for three. We know how you work. I asked you to embroider a towel in winter. Where is it? I asked you to fix the carburetor. - The engine stalls. - And Gayane's onesies? - I have already… - Don't interrupt! Come on, stop crying, take the menu and get to work! Another client? No tables available! Kebabs are across the street. I've just been there. The line is huge. Yury Leonidovych, my dear! Why didn't you tell us you were coming? We would've prepared for your visit. I told you I don't like bothering people. You may call me Yura. All right. Will you have dinner, Yura Leonidovych? How are you? How's your family? It's OK. Thanks for asking. My wife had our third baby recently. Wow, congrats! You're one lucky man. You are right… But I have to feed four mouths. It's OK. You will get a 25% salary increase next month. Thank you, Yury Leonidovych! - May God bless you with good health! - Stop it, Gena. What are you doing? Sorry. I used to work for gangsters. The force of habit. Oh no. A wedding in Yablunivka is a bad idea. I wanted to party in Kyiv and you make me go back to a small town. It was Yura's idea, not mine. Food's so cheap here! I will have soup and a main course. And some cake, too. Olya, this is weight in grams. And these are the prices. Well… I am not hungry, actually. Too bad. I have already made an order. Voila. Listen, I have an idea. We'll eat but we won't pay. Huh? We'll say there were cockroaches. Cool! Natalka, how come we didn't think of that? We always pay at the restaurants. So dumb. Just ask me, Yurik. I'll teach you how to wipe the bar codes off stuff, too. He's teasing you. We won't pay anyway. This is Yura's restaurant. What? - The whole restaurant? - Yes. And the shopping mall. Holy shit! Your man is a goldmine, girl. Oh, I mean… I wasn't talking about you. I… It's OK. We, the goldmines, don't get offended easily. Let's drink to the goldmine! Villa chinchilla! That's quite a mall! It's bigger than our Yablunivka! That's right. You can find the best presents for your family here. Kryzhanivska! Are you lost? I saved for the vacation in Zalizny Port, but the prices here are so attractive… What? They say you must buy a Christmas tree in summer. Huh? My congratulations, Leonidovych. I thought you'd marry only after your retirement. - Thanks. By the way, you are invited. - Sure thing. But we are not going to celebrate here. Wait. Don't tell me. Let me guess. Greece? Italy? - Maldives? - Joking, Andron? Levandovsky likes surprising people. In Yablunivka. Yablunivka? In Podillya? Yes. You should get married in a year, then. Why? Will Yablunivka turn into Maldives in a year? Maybe not into Maldives. But our company is going to build 13 new malls there. Oh, this wedding made me forget about business. Don't you worry, my friend. I have everything under my personal control. Here! Oh, the abolition of serfdom in Podillya. A reproduction. Oh, and here are the poor and the deprived. The museum guard damaged one of the mannequins so I had to get involved to show how much our ancestors had suffered. Right. We should get rid of the museum. You are doing God knows what. But it's illegal. Vasyl, you have to realize nobody needs culture nowadays. What do people want? Bread and entertainment! So some good people will build a shopping and entertainment center here. They can build anything. But, Ivan Petrovych, why touch the museum? The center will be built in the place of the museum. Here, sign it. I can't. This place is the heart of culture and history of Podillya. We have a unique collection of jars. Three thousand items! We didn't sell them even to Yuschenko! Let me finish. It's not for free. First, Seredyuk doesn't take bribes. And second – I appreciate your trust, Ivan Petrovych, but I can't. I have an exhibition here. Podillya is great, you know. The nature is fabulous! And the local girls are great! My Natalka's from there. Listen, Leonidovych, I want to ask you something, but don't get mad, OK? Why did you fall for her? She's a plain girl. Oh, you know nothing about women. That's why you divorced three times. Natalka is… She's all milk and roses. She's… Yury Leonidovych, I said you had a meeting. But Natalia Vasylivna… Natalia Vasylivna is more important than any meeting, right, cupcake? It's OK, Ira. You may go. Hi, Andron, I didn't recognize you. How long are you going to stay here? Did you buy a pair of shoes in a boutique and run out of money? Only shopaholics go to boutiques in the morning. I was buying presents for my family. Why didn't you take your husband along? Because he's not my husband yet. Where I grew up, such men were called "rich lovers"… And where I grew up, such girls were called… What? Come on, come on. Say it, Levandovsky, don't be scared. - They were called "chicks". - Oh… How banal. I like "rockets" more. Do you remember where you planned to go today? You have 10 minutes to get ready. My stuff is already in the car. Olga's watching it. Do you see now why I fell for her? Yeah. That woman is a ball of fire. They don't need culture… They don't care about history… Oh, those thieves! They'd sell Ukraine if they had a chance! Father, what are you grumbling about? Look at him resting! Have you picked potato beetles? Sure. Half of the jar. But you didn't get this one, huh? Did it look too pathetic to you? It's impossible to collect all the beetles. That's because the French are too lazy. A Ukrainian wouldn't stop, moreover in someone's garden. What do I do with the rest when the jar is full? Throw them into Taras' yard. But make sure nobody sees you. Holy Moses! You have plenty of booze here. We sure do. A mini bar. A "mini bar"? I only saw something like that in a hotel in Turkey. Yurik… Huh? Go ahead. That's a good man! As my Ashot would say: "Cool dude". I still don't get it. Why must we have a wedding in Yablunivka? We can do without a wedding, if you want. I am OK with being a bachelor. Yeah, right. My family is not ready for 3 surprises. Why three? First, me. Second, you. Third, a wedding at home. I should've invited them to Kyiv. We'd have a star wedding! It's simple, you know. I grew up in the orphanage. All the kids there had the same dream. A family. A big and friendly one. The last part isn't about my family. I quarreled with parents and left home. Honey, that's why I want our wedding to take place in your family circle. I want the atmosphere of the family comfort, everyone gathering around the table, singing songs, laughing, raising their glasses… Well, and that, too. Kryzhanivska snores like a tractor. What did you expect? The Irish whisky. The land of Podillya welcomes you! Even our suitcases fell down. Olya, are you all right? Wrecked. But not because of the pothole. YABLUNIVKA Galya, your borsch is sour like Russian shchi. My borsch is good, right, son? Magnifique, Mama! What do you know about our dishes? Borsch is a masterpiece. Unlike the frog legs. I cook borsch for Francois. It's not worse than Mom's. Right, girl. It just can't be worse. Kryzhanivska, wake up! Olya, come on, wake up! Ah! I see. All right, wait for 5 minutes. If I am not back by that time, you must go inside. OK? OK. And if you hear screams, start the car and drive. I'll jump into a moving car. I can do that. Seredyuk, if you don't like it, you can go to the restaurant. I will! And I will have real Ukrainian borsch, not that junk of yours! Kids, did you hear that? Now listen. From this moment on, you are on a diet. Are you going to fight because of that borsch? Oh my God! My dear girl! Hi! Mom! Our teddy bear has grown up. He is courting bear girls now. Hi! Meet my husband Francois. And this is my sister Natalka. Nice to meet you! You surprised me, little sister. You never liked chocolate as a kid. Oh. Pardon. I had some garlic. Vasyl, please, I beg you, don't make a scene, all right? You could have called your father at least once in five years. The same goes for you. But we both are so proud. What can we say? We are the Seredyuks. - Olya! - Ashot, leave me alone! I don't want…! Honey, I am so happy you are not mad at us anymore. Right, Vasyl? I always knew her wisdom would take over her temper. Why? Because Natalka is my daughter. Well, my visit is just the first surprise. There are more. I am getting married. Who is he? I hope he's Ukrainian. A real Kozak? Or, God forbid, some pigherd? Do you think there are pigs in Kyiv? Yes. They built God knows what in that ancient city. Don't worry. He's Ukrainian. A businessman, too. We'll have our wedding here. Honey, are you sure he is a businessman? Good afternoon! Good afternoon. Looks like you got the wrong address. The church is down the street. We don't need brochures. Yury. Vasyl. Romanovych. You are from the old folks' home, not from the church! Dad! He is my fiancée. What's wrong with you? Is that how you meet your son-in-law? No. He is some 20 years late to be my son-in-law. Who is he, your driver? I am a gigolo. Her kept lover. Dad! This is for you. There is something inside, too. What is it? And this present is for our French relative. Oh-la-la! Oh! Magnifique! Under your tongue, Father! I feel better already. OH-LA-LA! And now… The present for my father-in-law. I picked it myself. Thanks, but I already have a razor… a cologne and a pair of socks. Don't try to guess. Open it, Romanovych. It's a Scythian amphora. A barbarian! A savage! The 5th century BC. There are only two of those in the world! There is only one now. That's how Ukrainian roads destroy Ukrainian history. Don't worry. We'll glue it together, Vasya. Vasya? There, there. An old misfit, your highness. Just for the doghouse. Ha-ha-ha. To the cart! Come on, cattle. Galya, did you see that? Do something! A new son-in-law. What a shame. What will people say? "Your girl brought an oldie"? What are you saying? He is only 43. That's what I said. An old goat. We're of the same age! What do you have to do with it? Natalka is 25! Look, you are her mom. Talk to her. Tell her everyone makes mistakes and she's no exception. Of course people must respect the elderly. But not marry them! Talk to her if you don't like her choice. I like Yury. Are you out of your mind? Want folk to make fun of me because of my new son-in-law? Who will make fun of you? Taras, for example. He will drink with his son-in-law, and what will I do with mine? Measure his pressure? I am telling you again: you want to talk to Natalka, then talk! Do you think I am scared? I'll call her here and tell her everything. Wait. Now go ahead. I'll do it tomorrow. It's already late. Taking a rest, huh? Oh! I did… Miss Yablunivka, you know. And our neighbors' goat has babies. That's because she had a young he-goat wooing her. Very interesting… Our young cherry tree doesn't bloom, because an old walnut tree keeps it in its shade. - When the young moon comes out at nigh… - Dad! Whatever you say doesn't matter, because I love him. He makes me happy! Natalka, my baby… that's what I wanted to hear! One! And two! One-two-three! One! And two! One-two-three! One! And two! One-two-three! One! And two! One-two-three! One! Germiona Vitoldivna, wake up! One! And two! One-two-three! One! And two! One-two-three! And… Greetings to the brilliant people of art! Oh, hello there, Vasyl Romanovych! That's my XXL Ballet. We're preparing for a regional contest. Angela, stretch your leg! Nazar, I have a business offer for you. I want you to sabotage Natalka's wedding. Thank you, Vasyl Romanovych. I do need money, of course. But I value my reputation more. It's not going to be ruined. Just a few extra spots, is all. Hold the leg, please. What about honor? And dignity? And the great mission of a wedding attendant? I am an angel bringing hearts together. And what are you offering me? A double fee. I am in! - Consider the wedding ruined! - I knew you'd help. I offer a whole range of wedding services. Nazariy Zapuhlyak has a few secret ways of blowing up a wedding. The most important thing is to crash Natalka's wedding. And then she might break up with that old fart in a week or two. You're offending me. Nazariy Zapuhlyak is always doing his best. The bride and the groom will quarrel and break up at the wedding. Oh, may the groom do well on a wedding night! Kiss the bride! Kiss the bride! Kiss the bride! Kiss the bride! Kiss the bride! When the husband is old and there is no love, this is hardly a match made in heaven above! You are my lifesaver! Two more thousand for that. This is the end of all potato beetles. OK, now Vasyl Seredyuk will organize his elder daughter's wedding. Don't argue with me. Why are you so eager? Did you make up a new scheme? No schemes, just the old conservative traditions of Podillya. Meet your wedding attendant. Nazariy Zapuhlyak. Nice to meet you. I've been at the wedding services market since 1997. - Is he your relative? - No… It will be easier, then. Good-bye. What do you mean? Not our level. We'll have a respectable wedding. And he is just a hillbilly amateur. Excuse me, sir, but I am a laureate of The Talents of Podillya contest, an award winner of the Kumedia-mopedia festival, a member of the Here Comes the Artist. I… Exactly. I was not mistaken. You are an amateur and a loser. OK, wait. Who is it going to be, if not Nazarchik? Vasya, look at your daughter. Only the top celebrities must perform at our wedding. Like my relative. I knew that! You just want to have your relative perform at your wedding, even if he lacks talent. That's right. So, my untalented relative, Oleg Vinnyk, will sing at our wedding. Vinnyk? Oh my goodness gracious! Let me give you a kiss! That's enough, Galya. Enough, I said. Galina, do you hear me? A hillbilly amateur… I bet he is from some outskirts of Kozyatin himself… The problem is that he is from Kyiv. You can't take him by surprise. I couldn't, you see. Will you give up and just accept it? What can I do? Natalka is not like Katya. If she suspects something, we're done for. It'll be a scandal. And she will leave and get married in the capital. And give you such a son-in-law? - He is an amateur and a loser. - Do you think I am happy with that? I see he's rich and arrogant. Only came yesterday but is bossing around! That's exactly why you mustn't give up. Don't let this amateur and loser into your family! You can always count on me and my help. Thanks. But I don't have any ideas. How can I get rid of that jerk? No idea. But I know one thing for sure. If you let this wedding happen, your new son-in-law will make your life a real hell. You think I don't know that? Let's give someone a spanking, just for the fun of it! Who? Someone you won't feel sorry for? Maybe you shouldn't…? Oh, I am sure we should, Vasia! Our Natalka at the prom. Isn't she the prettiest one? She sure is. She's got a cool dress, too. I made it from my old dress. - And a pillowcase from what was left. - Mom… These are my favorite ones. Natalka and her suitors. - Six pages. - Mom, let's turn these pages. Why's that? It's interesting. OK… I remember these ones, kiddo. I chased them off all right. - And who's this dude here? - Oh, this is Petya Popadyuk. The Police Lieutenant Colonel? Was he hitting on you, too? Just a little bit. Don't be so modest. You two were dating. Careful, Seredyuk. These are memories. Why do I find out about this guy just now? Because Popadyuk is at the bottom of my suitors' list. At the bottom? No way! People like Petya don't drown. Vasyl Romanovych, it's just impossible. So many years have passed. I swear! She's been asking about you since she came here. "How's Petya?" "What's new with Petya?" "Did he get married?" Mister Seredyuk, I am a cop but I not a moron. I know what you are getting at. But, according to the information I possess, Natalka came here with her fiancée. He isn't her fiancé. He's an old man. What do you mean, an old man? She is looking after him in the capital. She gets paid for that. Well, OKk. But what is he doing here? She came on vacation and had to take the old goat along. There is nobody else to look after him. He is so feeble and weak, he can't even make a cup of tea. I don't know… I still think it's some kind of a trick. You still love her. I can see it in your eyes. Am I right? Sure. She was the only girl who agreed to date me. Just for two days, though. See? Will you lose your chance to be happy again? Petro, you can't be a bachelor forever! You have to continue the Popadyuks' family line. Newlyweds, listen to my order! Kiss! Thank you! Thank you, Vasyl Romanovych! I will come with the matchmakers. No hurry. Too early for matchmakers. It takes time to conquer a lady. She's like a repeated offender. - Shall we prepare for a mission? - Let's start with a date. We mustn't take too long. It has to be done today. OK, I'll be there. Wait. What do I do after I come over? Well… You must do something. Mr. Seredyuk, this is not a plan but some bullshit. I need to know what to do. Should it be interception? Takedown? Assault? What? A signal. I will give you a signal. For the strong action. What if I don't notice your signal? Fail? Don't worry. Everyone will notice my signal. Natalka's got a "tapper". A what? A Mastercard. Oh God, life is so unfair! We already have enough problems, and now the Seredyuks get rich! Oh, be quiet, Mom. I had a sleepless night myself. When I imagine Natalka's wedding… I don't care about your Natalka. Look at Galya! That woman is so lucky. She has a better house, and a millionaire son-in-law! You just don't understand. The Seredyuks' new son-in-law is the light at the end of the tunnel for us. What are you talking about, dad? - Taras! - What tunnel? Yurik means money. And money means everything. So what? Yes, the Seredyuks are about to get rich. But Vasyl is an unhappy person now. You couldn't dream higher. Maybe you couldn't. But I have always dreamt of a rich son-in-law. And I got this one instead. What do you mean?! - Be quiet and look at the road! - Come on, come on! I said start the car! Phew! Finally! Dad, no! You'll get the car all dirty inside! You must walk! Good afternoon. Petya? Just look at you. - I hardly recognized you. - I am a Lieutenant Colonel already. The youngest one in the region. I mean, by age. Really? That's great. I'll be a Colonel in a few years. So… I got the prospects and stuff. Yeah… I see. And what brought you here? I heard you came to visit. And me and you… Do you remember, back then? What happened back then? Well, you went to Kyiv, and I became a cop… I mean a policeman. It's been hard and difficult for me, but I am doing my best. - What's this? - This? Well, there was a sale in the grocery store. And you… And I am not a cheapskate, right? So, this is for me? Yes, ma'am. Thank you! Hey! Are you out of your mind? How dare you kick your father-in-law in his own house? Father, is that you? I saw an elk through the glasses. I wanted to kick it out. Why are you smiling? Natalka is watering flowers. Bring her some water. Doesn't the host know where the buckets are kept? He knows it but… I have heart issues. Francois doesn't let me lift heavy things. Franik, show my new son-in-law where we keep the buckets. Let's go, Francois. Well… A Lieutenant Colonel, I am. Petya, you have already told me so. Why did you come? Are you crazy?! That's what I love you for! Hello there. I am Lieutenant Colonel Popadyuk. And you are that old man? Old? What does it mean? I heard you were looking after an old man in Kyiv and brought him along. If you heard that, it must be me. I heard he couldn't walk. Who? Petya, are you drunk? I don't drink at work. Your old man couldn't walk. If you don't leave right now, I… - Yes, ma'am. - Go! Have a nice day. Seredyuk, don't hide your eyes. What was that silly boy doing here? How do I know? I am getting ready for the wedding. See? I am mincing meat. Think it was his idea? It looks suspicious to me. He never visited us until our daughter came here with her fiancée. So? Petya is not a coward, you know. He might have decided to fight for the love of his youth. Not a coward, you say? He doesn't come outside to pee without a gun. He has feelings for her. It's a different thing. Mom, Petya tried to kiss me. Can you imagine that? - Oh my God. How did he dare? - No idea. A flare rose into the sky, and he grabbed me trying to kiss… Oh, so that's what the noise was. I ran to the cellar, I thought the jar lids exploded. Wait. Who made the shot? Oh! I forgot something! I need to protect the taxidermized bear from the moth. I must go now! Well, seriously. All right, all right. It's so hot. Not a single bird around. Only the flare pistols. Oh, this Seredyuk never changes. Your tone tells me that Mr. Seredyuk is into pyrotechnics. Am I right? As my Olga would say, "it's his shtick". When the girls were young and went dancing, all the Yablunivka knew: the fireworks meant Seredyuk was calling them home. As a rule, people who forbid others to do things do them themselves. Yes. Do you think the old man has sinned? Yes! He had an affair last year. With a librarian. She really likes this writer… Kokotyukha… He used it to get her attention. So, did he and the lady… No! This is Seredyuk, you know. Galina caught them. Listen, Taras-jan, do I look like a flower-bed? So, Taras, are you OK there, dude? I'll make you beautiful now… Ashot… A librarian, huh? Get the ball, Vasya. Kokotyukha is history. A mistake of my youth. Too bad. I wanted to join the circle of the intellectuals of Yablunivka. Well, if there aren't any cult writer figures in the new generation, - I think I should leave… - There are… I mean there is. But he is… out of our reach! Who is he? I need a name, sister! Zhadan! Zhadan? ZHADAN Hello, Yury Leonidovych! My friend, I have an idea. What about having a reading in a very nice library? What do you say? Anything to please you! Anything to please you! I want something unusual… Listen, I read in a magazine that people who get married in a leap year have unhappy lives. After the leap year comes the year of a widower, then – the year of a widow and only then - the happy year. What I am trying to say is that maybe Natalka should wait for a few years… I don't insist. It's just the folk wisdom. Well, who needs it, anyway? I am happy for my daughter. I couldn't have imagined such happiness when we got married… Well, why talk about the past? I am a mature man now. I am – oh, I am just something else! - Oh God! What are you doing here? - Longing for Zhadan. What are you doing here, Yura dear? I wanted to wish my new family a nice and quiet evening. How sweet of you… Vasyl Romanovych, wait for 10 more minutes. This is my dream. If Galina catches us, she will put an end to both your life and dreams. Go wish father a nice evening. He has already received my greetings. I am ready to die for him! Have a nice journey! Well, I… wanted to get some fresh air. It's hot. You broke my heel… What a fool I am! The mosquitos can get inside! Stop right there! Galya dearest, we are a civilized family. Why do we need this medievalism? Please let me explain… Shush… I want to listen to him now. Can't wait to hear how he explains it this time. Galya dearest, I swear I have no idea how this got into our bedroom… - Actually… - Do you want to live? I do. Unfortunately, you lost your chance. Oh, here you are. I've been waiting for you in the yard. It was to be a surprise but since you have already found out… Please meet Ulyana, the kids' animator at our wedding. Who? Someone has to take care of kids so their parents can have a good time, right? And the keeper of knowledge is just the right person for that. I think the Rapunzel outfit doesn't look very modest. Is there anything in old and conservative traditions of Podillya? Maybe, Povitrulya? It's a deal, then. We'll see you on our wedding day. Good-bye. I must go, too. Don't stay for too long. Oh, I'll be out of here in a moment. I'll just drink some water as my throat… …is dry, right? I understand! A hard day. And unexpected guests! That cop who came to Natalka and the librarian who wanted you… 1:1. He was standing there with that disgusting smile… I'll kill him! I must say a real man would never do such a thing. Be a man! Have a complaint? Say it to my face! And what he did is just… What are you doing? Me? Well… All our actresses went to work in Poland, so I am saving both our local theater and my family budget. See? The whole country is living in misery and those profiteers benefit from people's hardships. You have to, no, you must punish at least one oligarch! And we… will help you with that! I mean I will. He doesn't know who he is messing with! So many hordes have shed blood in the land of Yablunivka! We'll see what the cream of society of Podillya is capable of! Yes! We'll show them we are worth our Kozak ancestors! Tell me what to do. I don't have a single idea, Nazarchik. You are a man of art. Think of something. OK, what do we know about him? Where did he study? His interests? His friends? I don't know. He didn't tell us anything. A secretive oligarch nobody ever heard about, came to our middle of nowhere to get married. Sounds like a con. No… Natalka isn't… Oh, it's so easy to fool us, ladies… Especially for an experienced conman! Have you seen his documents? How many passports? Are you suggesting I go through his things? You have a right to go through anyone's things in your house. Compromising data! No, I can't do this. It's not nice… It's either us… or them. I have to go now. Why can't he be a normal conman? He's only got one passport and it's a real one. It's like… It's not a good sign to show your wedding dress before the wedding… Come on. I just can't wait. I expected to hear this from my fiancée, not from my mother. It's good dad is not here or we'd have a lot to hear. What is this noise? Are there mice? I'm losing my patience. Will you open that box? In a moment… I have never seen anything so beautiful… Mom… You also had a beautiful bridal veil. Every bride's wedding dress is beautiful. Oh I wish. The times were hard back then… And your father… isn't a romantic person. You chose him for some reason. Oh, come on! This is not the capital, you know. If a man is not humpbacked or crippled, he's just fine for Yablunivka. Mom! Huh? Oh, there's a mirror in the wardrobe. Is it broken or what? Let's go to my room, to a bigger mirror. OK. We are of the same age and we are both Aquarius. If I met him earlier, this would've been my bridal veil. Can you imagine that? Mom, let's go to the mirror. Go! Lord Levandosky, I have brought you a servant. You can do anything you want with him. Go to bed. Go! No, kind sir, I belong in the doghouse or the cattle shed, not in the lord's bed. You fool! I already have someone to stay in my bed. Galya? What are you doing here? I am here to fulfill all the wishes of our lord. Hold tight. I want to see everything well. So? How much time do I have left? What are you saying, dad? You're still in good shape. Right, Franik? Yes, you are! But you mustn't worry. Students in my college played a trick on a professor once. They scared him. And he… kicked the bucket. Franik, what was this scary story for? Father must know that all men over 40 have heart problems. What? Why didn't you tell me that before? It's a great… That professor was a great person. Where are you going, dad? You are not well. I feel wonderful! Good job, Francois. Father! Are you getting a loan? I already got it! Hold this. Oh my God! What's this primitive handicraft? It's ancient Cherkaschina! The reconstruction of an archaic human! Vasyl Romanovych, do you want me to die? No! This weapon is meant for another beast! Thank you… The neighing of horses, the ringing of a cowbell… The Father is saying his last farewell. I didn't know Yury well. But I don't think he'd want us to cry and dehydrate. We need to take care of our health. We have a living proof of that… I mean, just a proof. I won! 2:1! This is a great idea. We bring the old dude to the woods, Chuchundra the monster attacks him and – voila! – the heart attack! You didn't see me. I didn't see you. Can you imagine my cellmates finding out the parts I played? The death will be imminent. That's what they will write in the report. "His heart gave up". It happens to men over forty. I don't know what happens to the other men but I have made it to forty and І am not going to give up! Well…. Hands off! OK, sorry, I didn't mean to. I better go now. I forgot the head of the local tax office is celebrating his anniversary soon so I have to get ready for the event. His anniversary? Why wasn't I told about it? The toast master from Kharkiv has already taken the advance. Someone has seriously discredited our village amateur talents. Wait! I agree. I don't get it. Where's jamon? - It's fasting time, isn't it? - You said the chorister was ready. He's still learning. Go bring the jamon, child. I'll explain everything later. He sings very well, though. Hello there. - We are going to Grushiv. - There's a convent there, not a monastery. We are not going there to stay. We saw Saint Anthony in our dreams. He told us to visit the sisters who rejected civilization and went to live in the wilderness. The saint women are doing well. They lead the stray sheep to righteousness. We will give communion to the sheep and go home. - Home. - Oh-oh. I am sorry, but I will really need your services tomorrow. Can it wait till next week? Sorry, but I don't have that much time. The best day is tomorrow. What did you bring? It's fasting time! But you said you'd explain… I am explaining: you don't eat meat during the fasting time. Take it back to the storage room. Will the afternoon work? Do you know the prices? Sure. I'll be waiting. Thanks. You can stay, but I am leaving today. Tell Mother Superior I will come tomorrow in the evening. I don't get it. Where's jamon? Remember, son, in our business being a good singer isn't enough. You have to use your brains too. Got it? Yes. Go bring us that jamon, then! I have a lot to teach him. Now the pose of a lion. A young modern woman like you has to do yoga and trust her instructor. - Well, I don't know… - On your knees. Straighten your back. Arms forward. Stick your tongue out, exhale. - What are you doing? - It's hatha yoga. To cure the chondrosis. I can fix your spine if you want me to. Well, actually, I am here because I want to fix the things between us. - To start from the beginning, so to say. - Exhale. I am holding you from behind. So… How about we mend ties by the old tradition of Podillya? No drinking. Francois said you mustn't drink. Doesn't she have to be silent during yoga? Not a real yogi. Exhale. We'll go to the woods to hunt a wild boar. That's just what we need to start a good male friendship. Hunting? Are you going to hunt wild animals or the librarians? Galya, I will control everything. I am not going to worry about it, then. It was like electric current going through my back. Are we going tomorrow? No! Tonight. We have to finish that boar as soon as possible. What's this flea market? I am not an experienced hunter, of course, but I know a boar has to die from a bullet, not from aesthetic shock. What? Voila! Father, give me the rifle. I have never had such a selfie. A weapon, for you? Where do you think you are going, anyway? He wants to join our male fraternity. Is it a problem? Oh… Yes! What if something happens to this foreigner? There will be an international conflict! The European sanctions! You are not going hunting, Franik. Why did Rozetka bring all this, then? I want to go with you! You can't go to our woods. You have a different blood type. The mosquitos will eat you. Here! The boars hang out over there in the morning. And we are going to spend the night here. You make the fire and I… I have to go to the bushes, you know. Your wish is my command, my captain. I am here. Oh damn, you scared me! What a talent! What a charisma! Vasyl Romanovych, I am out of it. It wasn't supposed to be a criminal case. Now you have aggravating factors. It's suspicious to hunt without a rifle. You will kill him, and I will go to jail, huh? Not gonna happen. Here, take all the ammo. Here, here. Is it OK now? Are you satisfied? Now listen to my plan. - I'll go to him and give him some tea. - With poison? No, it's diuretic tea I bought in the drug store. So he drinks it, then goes to the bushes and then our furry friend comes in. Did you call someone else, too? I mean the monster of Podillya. And my dear son-in-law is "scared" unexpectedly. Oh God, he's so young… Though he who comes with the sword, deserves ill fate… Now I recognize Nazariy and his battle spirit. OK, so you have to attack when you see he is alone. Oh! Attaboy! I brewed it myself. With the best intentions. The whole Gestapo platoon went missing in these woods. They thought the guerrillas killed them. Hitler himself found out about it and sent a battalion here. And? It disappeared without a single shot. People heard someone howling at the moon. How does Hitler relate to it? He ordered to build a bunker in Vinnitsya instead of Yablunivka. He was afraid of the Wolf Monster of Podillya. You get a bonus for a great story. I also know a horror story about the tax office. But first I have to go to the bushes. Oh, finally. Rest in peace. Attack when you see he's alone. Vasyl Romanovych, is that you? Where is your son-in-law? Don't shoot! What a man. He predicted the day of his death and came here himself to invite us. I'd call him a saint if he gave us the advance. Hello there. What brings you here? Did something happen? Yes, sister. A great tragedy for all of us. A good man left this world. Oh goodness. Vasya, why are you lying? Get up. People are grieving here. You must accept it. He will never get up. But he will fly to heaven leaving only smoke behind. Wake up! You mustn't sleep in the middle of the day. Oh dear Lord, didn't you…? You know? Why did you ask us to come, then? Well… I guess you just got me wrong. "I have a job for you. Come in the afternoon" you said. Could anyone get this wrong? Oh! Someone is back to his old ways, huh? Come back tomorrow. And today I am going to have a serious talk with that someone. These people! First they die, then resurrect… The priest mixed something up. It's a misunderstanding. Oh really? Why didn't you tell me before? Let's join the kids at the table. Do you think I am stupid? I know what you are up to! I know you want to break up the wedding! Again! Ouch! Galya! The varenyky are so good today. Yura, have some sour cream with your varenyky. Thank you. Oh! Is your mustached entertainer in good health? How did he survive reputation damage? Thanks God, he has nothing serious to hurt. I guess we missed something, right? - No! - Yes! The local amateur talents organized a performance in the woods for me. Galya! Galya, no! Mama! Papa has heart problems! His head is just fine, though! I have nothing to do with it. Nazarchik has invented a new contest to impress Yury. Since when is that honored scarecrow of Ukraine inventing something? You're done. Give up. It's better to lose on points than to be knocked out. 2:1. Well, well. I prepare for the wedding and you have a tournament? The boys are playing, huh? No. I am just… just saying… I did nothing, really, did I? A naked librarian is "nothing" to you? Who? Mm… the patriarchy. Hey, Dad, what do you think you are doing? Who is going to change Gayane's diapers, me? Mom, come here. There is a show at the Seredyuks'. What? I didn't have the plates thrown at me. You must be happy she missed. I thought I knew Natalka well. Did you decide to get married before getting to know your bride? It's OK, just come home drunk and then… Didn't you disapprove of our wedding? I just looked at things from one side. And now I see that though you are rich, you don't have that much luck in life. Why is that? Because you are going to marry that angel, my daughter. So now you have to think and decide if you need that wedding at all. I do! You know, you are right. My life hasn't been too lucky. I grew up in the orphanage. I had to fight for things everyone else took for granted. I had to earn them, to gnaw them out. Judging by your car and your suits, I can tell you gnawed all that out like a real wolf. But the wolf is doing that for his pack, and you… And I am doing it for mine. Here they are. 87 little wolf cubs who have been punished by this world since the day they were born. They have the best teachers, equipment, field trips. I paid for their education abroad. Maybe it will help them find… Find what? A family. I've been looking for one for so long and now, when I finally found it, I ruined everything. I am sorry. I don't know what has gotten into me. Sorry. I am no better than you. My temper is just… I am sorry, too… Do you think I have a chance to make up with Natalka? What are you saying? Your wedding is tomorrow! You must get ready! This is not the last time we are sitting on this bench together. You think so? Welcome to the family, son. What is this? What it this?! I am asking you?! - Grassement! - That's right! A real nightmare! My girl marries today and I don't have a vyshyvanka! I have nothing to wear!! You can wear this one, Dad. Or this one. You look good in both. You! Do you realize what you are suggesting? This is the Lemkos Easter shirt! This is from the Slobozhany region. Where is the Podillya wedding shirt? Not here! Wait till I find out who sabotaged Natalka's wedding. Maybe you have taken it to the museum? You are right! "The wedding traditions of Podillya". It was the gem of the exhibition. Hey! Why are you blocking the way? Step aside. I am saving the wedding! Where are you going? Can't you see it's closed? I know that. I am the director of this museum. And who are you? I am the chief of security here. Since when? I didn't appoint you! The new owners of the facility appointed me. Don't call museum a facility! It's a temple of history! What do you mean, the new owners? The facility was privatized. They are going to build a shopping mall here! Oh, now wait… a minute. No wonder your face looked familiar. Come during the working hours to pack. You'll get the inventory list. I am going to take your whole gang to the prosecutor's office. By to the inventory list. Leave, now! Another word, and you'll spend the night at the police. For the raider attack. Traitors, double-dealers, mankurts, janissaries! You're lucky my girl gets married today. But tomorrow you will find out who Vasyl Seredyuk is! I don't get it. Why do we have to give that millionaire a wedding present? Did he give anything to us? Or to our little one? He just came here a few days ago. How could he get us any presents? That's why he is a millionaire. Because he turns up when he can get something for free. Here's my present for him! Mom, if there was a greediness contest, you would even outrun Dad. One can't come to the wedding without a gift. - Oh, come on. - Wait a minute. Look. This is a great present. It's been here forever. It's still packed. Of course it's still packed. Semenchikha's birthday is soon; it's a gift from accountants. I have collected the money. Found it! Stainless steel, made in Germany. It will be the best present, I swear. Let me order and they will bring it soon. Do you know why you don't have new boots? Because someone has been sponsoring the millionaires. What are you saying? It's Caucasian tradition to give good presents. Tell me the truth! - Did you fall for Natalka? - What? Who's Natalka? I knew that! Look at your shifty eyes! You did fall for her, didn't you? The womanizer! Wait! Wait! Are you crazy? This present is too expensive. We should keep it. I have another present for them. It's big and it's absolutely free and useless. We just need… to wrap it nicely. This one, maybe? No, we want that pink one! We have an exact sum! I told you! No one will give them such a gift. It's unique. Why did you get such an expensive ribbon? You could put 50 UAH to better use. Lower your voice. You are embarrassing us. Oh, don't even start, ok? - Congratulations. - Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yury, your choice is historically right. The beauty of our girls from Podillya is even mentioned in the ancient manuscripts. Thank you. But let me tell you, what used to be yours is now mine. Thank you! Thank you! Congratulations! Thank you! Congratulations, mate! Dad, you came almost in time. I will forgive you if you go and change now. I have a question. Who are these people? Actually, they are guests. I'd do without them but your daughter said inviting guests was the point of the wedding. I didn't finish. Who are those two guys who were laughing and hugging you just now? Yura's mate and a local supercrat. He is head of… something. I don't know details. He's helped our company a great deal. Thanks. Now go over there and eat! Dad, I understand your daughter's wedding is really an emotional event, but please don't… What kind of help could it be? As far as I know, that… head has never helped anyone. He found some tattered building, Yura's company will build a shopping mall there. So it was you who did it, huh? Yes! A new page of the history of Yablunivka is about to start. - And I am going to write it. - You meant to say "we are", right? Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations to the happy father of the family on this wonderful event. I think the Lord Himself wouldn't mind us filling glasses to that… You'll say that at the table. Now we should speak of God's grace. What a shame. Like I didn't teach you right. The ungrateful generation. They value nothing but money. Do I deserve this? Oh, you shouldn't complain, sir. It's much worse in the Grushiv convent where we went recently… Oh, yes. If you could only see the lost children sent there by their parents for reformation. Especially those twin girls. Do you think fighting for their happiness is worth it? It's our mission. We must do our best and spare no effort. Our scribe can't even walk. So overwhelmed… with grace. Well… Let it be… the convent, then. What took you so long? Did you get it? I couldn't find it in drugstores or in the hospital. Barely found it at the vet. He uses it to sedate horses, so I guess it would… work for your daughter, too. Be careful and wait for my go-ahead. Now hide. Dad, what are your shoes doing in Yura's car? - Such things do happen… - Don't explain! Come on, the guests are waiting. Sorry, my girl. I am saving you and our Podillya. Go ahead, Nazarchik! I am not going with you. It wasn't the deal. Put her in the car. This is my way. You are not getting my museum! And you are not marrying my girl! What? Again?? Natalka! Radio "Friday". Why so fast? Don't you see the sign? Driving fast – speeding ticket is a must. What are you doing? Looking for a song. It's been in my head since morning. Kashtany, kashtany… What about the amber alert? The assault teams? Why are we going so slow? We will lose him! If we are lucky, he'll go to neighboring district. If he has brains for that. Will you catch him? And he will spoil the statistics of another region. We won't get the quarter bonus now because of your father-in-law. Now listen to me, you… Quiet! I am Lieutenant Colonel of the police, for your information. Do you want to become a Colonel? Dad, don't you think kidnapping a bride was just a little bit too much? You woke up. But consciousness is asleep! OK. The convent will help you wake up. One, two… Hello? Look, I don't know what's going on in your head but everything can be talked over, all right? No. I've had enough of talking. It was a good idea to use your wedding to distract my attention and to make a mall out of my museum! Your museum? No! It's impossible. What did you listen to? How to turn it on? The batteries are dead. You have been singing karaoke yesterday. Use a cigarette lighter. No way! The voltage and the amperage are different. We were told it was an emergency facility and it wasn't functioning. It is functioning well. Do you know the Ohm's law for the part of the circle? Be quiet, then. Tell the boss we are saving people against all the laws of physics. Don't you worry. They rehabilitate junkies in that convent, so they will take you on, too. Attention! Repeated offender Seredyuk! This is Colonel-to-be Popadyuk speaking. Stop the car and let the bride out. Catch me first! Speed up, Serhiy! We are outside of the town! Repeated offender Seredyuk, stop! Don't cross the region border! This crime has to be solved by me, Colonel-to-be Popadyuk! It's a pedagogical moment, not a crime. Get a daughter and you'll understand. How long is it going to take? Just a sec. I have almost established contact. Pedagogue Seredyuk, let's talk about children! Stop your car and surrender. Podillya never surrenders! I'll show you "never"! Fire! Fire! Don't shoot! HAVE A GOOD JOURNEY Do you think you won? Do you think you knocked Seredyuk down? I know a good way to get you back on your feet. Can't wait to put me to jail, huh? Do you want to make fun of me? I'll make it to the Supreme Court. Make it to the neighboring ward first. Look through… these documents, OK? I am not going to sign anything. You managed quite well without me. Come on, read it. "The museum facility…" It will get even more interesting. "…passes into the private ownership of… Vasyl Romanovych Seredyuk"? Congratulations! As the benefactor of the first private museum in Podillya, I wish you a speedy recovery, so we can discuss our first exhibition. What am I going to say to the guys from the District State Administration? The same thing I said to my ex-partner. "Screw you". It's your property now, not theirs. All the property of the suspect Seredyuk is under arrest. Taking into account the severity of crime, there is a threat of the full confiscation. He changed his mind about being a Colonel. I will call my friend, a General, and… Ha-ha. I tricked you! My boss told me to work on my sense of humor, so I am learning. Mr. Seredyuk, I choose an administrative penalty for the crime you have committed. A warning. Uncle Vasya, don't do that again. Law and order are restored in the assigned territory. Yura… - Thank you for… - Stop it. That conversation on the bench… I really mean it. I don't have my own family so I save someone else's. Daughter. My dears. What do you mean, you don't? What about us? Natalka… Yura… My dearest… Our family is not the best one, of course. A lot of things happened here, both nice and crazy. But… we love you. I am sorry, my girl. Dad. Thank you. I bless you, children. A MONTH LATER Don't drink! May I have your attention, please? Turtledoves are cooing, warm greetings are heard. May the husband now say his happy word. Come on, sugar daddy, come on! That's… that's right. I want to thank all of you for not being scared to come to our party again. Don't worry, my car cannot be repaired. So, no chase this time! That's right. I have never had a family so I had no idea what it was supposed to be like. I imagined… drinking tea, listening to music. But this man… showed me the other side of the family. When he thought his daughter was in danger, he had no fear for the police or the oligarch. He rushed to her rescue with no hesitation. You know… we live in a very unpredictable country. But I can predict one thing for sure. If I ever run into danger, there is a person who will do the impossible to save me. This person is Vasyl Seredyuk! Natalka… I am… so happy I have met you. The woman who showed me what love was. I am also grateful to your father for showing me what a real family is like. Well, what are you? Mum. Look at our Kozak, his love by his side. Isn't it the high time to shout: "Kiss the bride"? Kiss the bride! Kiss the bride! One, two, three, four, six, come on! Grandpa. Her first word! Say it again, sweetie! What is it? Nothing! I'm your Cossack woman, I'm your wife My blue-eyed colonel! I told you he was a great singer! You must go to Kyiv with that voice of yours. Get into show business, and you will be a star! It's my dream. They pay big money there. Sure thing. Them stars have money coming out of their ears. You just wait for the Honey Feast of the Savior and you will see what big money is. I'm your Cossack woman, I'm your wife My blue-eyed colonel! For the new position! May there be fewer bandits and more archimandrites! OK, girls, be seated! Don't you see? The men of art have a lot of work. Come on, girls. You will have plenty of time to make selfies! Thank you! Thank you, colleague. I appreciate your help. Colleague? Why the hell did you come here, huh? You've got the whole country. Why do you need Yablunivka? I have been invited to come here, sir… Invited? You come and you go, and what am I to do after that? Die of starvation? Go work at the plant? You only think about yourself! I have a wonderful idea, my friend! Hello, ladies and gentlemen! For the first time in Podillya! The Young Wolves duet. Oleg! Oleg! OK, dude, if someone asks you… - I didn't see you. - You better go there. Oleg, where are you going? I know Yablunivka very well. You better surrender, you know… Oleg! Oleg! Oleg dear, I am your fan! I voted for you! What nonsense is that? It's fast now. You said that… - You said that the chorus singer is ready. - He is still learning. I don't get it. Where is jamon? Where is jamon? Lyosha, bro! I don't get it… My Seredyuk. Katrin! Father needs to know. I asked all men older than… 40. God, what are you doing here? Waiting for Zhadan. Mate, if… And you… Why are you showing pants? Why are you…? The moustache… got unstuck. Stop!
