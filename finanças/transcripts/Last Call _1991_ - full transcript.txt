LOOK, I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE. I'M TIRED, AND YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN FEELING WELL. MY HEART CAN'T TAKE THE STRESS. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU SAYING, NICK? MAYBE IT'S TIME WE WENT OUR SEPARATE WAYS. WE'VE HAD A GOOD RUN. YOU CAN DEPOSIT MY SHARE INTO MY ACCOUNT. I'M RETIRING. YOU RETIRE WHEN I SAY YOU DO, AND NOT A SECOND SOONER! DON'T TRY THAT WITH ME, JASON! REMEMBER, I KNOW WHERE THE SKELETONS ARE BURIED. THEY'RE YOUR SKELETONS, TOO, NICK. I SUGGEST YOU RECONSIDER. COME ON, BABY. LET'S GO. SOMETHING THE MATTER? NAH. IT'S NOTHING. JASON, WHEN SHALL I SAY YOU'RE EXPECTED BACK? MR. LAURENCE WILL BE OUT FOR THE REST OF THE DAY. [DOOR CLOSES] [LAUGHING] NICE TO KNOW YOU'RE ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS WITH CINDY. HEY, LOOK.

IT'S OK. THIS IS BETTY DUBOIS, CAROL'S MOTHER. IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU. HOW DO YOU DO? WHAT'S UP? NICK'S DEAD. Carol: HE'S DEAD? WHO'S NICK? JASON'S PARTNER. HOW? WHEN? WELL, HE'S LAYING THERE IN HIS UNDERWEAR, AND HE'S GOT HIS HANDS TIED TO THE BEDPOSTS. WELL, I KNEW HE WAS INTO SOME KINKY STUFF. NOT TOO SMART FOR A GUY IN HIS CONDITION. WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE? WELL, I WENT BY TO PICK UP SOME PAPERWORK. LOOK, THIS IS GONNA OPEN UP A WHOLE CAN OF WORMS FOR US. YOU KNOW, WE JUST GOT INVOLVED IN A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, AND NOW THE COPS ARE GONNA START ASKING A TON OF QUESTIONS. YOU'RE RIGHT. LOOK... THERE'S NO POINT IN YOU GETTING INVOLVED. HE WAS MY PARTNER. I'LL HANDLE IT. I'LL CALL THE COPS. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY? WELL, I'LL SAY I TRIED CALLING THE HOUSE, AND NOBODY ANSWERED, AND I'M CONCERNED BECAUSE HE HAS A HEART CONDITION. THE COPS WILL SEND SOMEONE TO CHECK ON HIM. THEY'LL FIND THE BODY. LOOK, GO ON HOME. GET SOME REST. TAKE IT EASY. THIS IS ALL GONNA WORK OUT. AT LEAST HE DIED WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE. HI. YOU DON'T GIVE UP EASILY, DO YOU? I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU. SINGLETON'S DEAD. [PINBALL MACHINE BEEPING] HONEY? HONEY, IT'S ALMOST PAST MIDNIGHT. AREN'T YOU GONNA COME TO BED? I'M TOO TENSE TO SLEEP NOW, BABY. [PINBALL MACHINE BEEPING] I HAVE A GREAT CURE FOR TENSE. LOOK, I GOT A LOT ON MY MIND NOW, OK? WELL, LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU-- DON'T LEAN ON THE MACHINE WHEN I'M PLAYING! OK. I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET ABOUT NICK'S DEATH, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT ON ME. I'M SORRY, BABY. WHAT'S BUGGING ME IS... I THINK PAUL AND NICK WERE UP TO SOMETHING BEHIND MY BACK. THAT MUST HAVE BEEN CREEPY, FINDING SINGLETON'S BODY LIKE THAT. I JUST HOPE JASON CALLED THE POLICE LIKE HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO. I CAN'T IMAGINE HIS BODY IS STILL LYING HANDCUFFED TO THE BED. WELL, THANKS FOR LISTENING. I GUESS... I SHOULD BE LEAVING. YEAH, I GUESS SO. I GOT TO GET UP EARLY MYSELF. WELL...GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. [BOTH SIGH] [KNOCK ON DOOR] PAUL... DID YOU READ THIS? YES. IT SAYS SINGLETON HAD BEEN CHARGED 3 TIMES WITH FRAUD AND EMBEZZLEMENT. PAUL, HE WAS JASON'S PARTNER FOR 15 YEARS. DIDN'T WE CHECK HIM OUT? YES, WE CHECKED HIM OUT, AND IT ALL SEEMED VERY LEGITIMATE. THE ATTORNEYS LOOKED AT THE PAPERWORK. THAYER SEEMED SATISFIED. COME ON! LET'S NOT JUMP THE GUN. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I'M GONNA GO SEE JASON. HOLD DOWN THE FORT. [DOORBELL RINGS] HI, PAUL. WHERE'S JASON? IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? JASON. DID YOU HAPPEN TO READ THE TIMES THIS MORNING? LOOK, IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF SENSATIONALIST LIES. YOU KNOW THE PRESS. IS THERE ANY TRUTH TO IT? LOOK, I ALREADY WENT OVER THIS WITH THE COPS. YOU KNOW, I REALLY HATE IT WHEN THEY GO AFTER PEOPLE'S REPUTATIONS WHEN THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T DEFEND THEMSELVES. LISTEN, MIKE'S ALREADY IN HYSTERICS OVER THE SITUATION, AND IT'S ONLY A QUESTION OF TIME BEFORE THAYER STARTS SCREAMING FOR HIS MONEY BACK. LOOK, PAUL, WE GOT TO KEEP OUR HEADS IN THESE SITUATIONS. JASON, I NEED SOME SORT OF A GOOD-FAITH GESTURE FROM YOU. WELL, THAT'S CRAZY. YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO BE A PARTNER WITHOUT INVESTING. I MEAN, IF YOU BOUGHT A CAR AND YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT THE COLOR, YOU JUST CAN'T RETURN IT THE NEXT DAY. YEAH. SPEAKING ABOUT CARS, WHAT ABOUT THIS NEW GERMAN TOY YOU HAVE SITTING OUT THERE? THIS IS PUSHING IT! I'VE ALWAYS MADE OTHER PEOPLE MILLIONS! AND I'M BRINGING ALL MY EXPERTISE AND CREATIVITY TO THIS! I JUST LOST MY PARTNER, AND YOU DON'T SHOW ME ANY KIND OF FRIENDSHIP OR SUPPORT! SO IS NO YOUR FINAL ANSWER? YOU'RE IN, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT! WELL, THEN I GOT TO DO WHAT I GOT TO DO. WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? JASON, JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE. YOU'RE MAKING IT WORSE. YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE. [TIRES SCREECHING] [TELEPHONE BEEPING] YEAH? PAUL, HOW DID THINGS GO WITH JASON? NOT GOOD. YEAH. WELL, I'M NOT SURPRISED. GUESS WHAT. THAYER WANTS TO SEE US. SHOOT! I ALSO SPOKE TO OUR ATTORNEYS. THEY SAY WE ARE REALLY IN A CATCH-22 HERE. YEAH? WELL, I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT. WELL, THEY SAY IF WE FILE SUIT, IT'LL PROBABLY COST US OVER 100 GRAND, AND EVEN IF WE WIN, MORE THAN LIKELY, JASON'S HIDDEN THE MONEY, AND COLLECTING IT WILL BE OUR RESPONSIBILITY. JEEZ! ON THE OTHER HAND, IF WE DON'T MAKE A CLAIM AND JASON FILES CHAPTER 11, WE CAN KISS OUR MONEY GOOD-BYE. PAUL, ARE YOU THERE? YEAH. YEAH, I'M HERE. DID YOU WANT ME TO GO WITH YOU TO SEE THAYER? UH, NO. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT MYSELF. ALL RIGHT. BYE-BYE. [VEHICLE APPROACHING] MR. THAYER, I'M SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING. I GOT A BIT OF A PROBLEM. I WENT TO SEE JASON, AND HE-- AND HE WON'T DO A THING. NO, SIR, HE WON'T. YOU SEE, PAUL, WHITE-COLLAR CRIME ISN'T TAKEN SERIOUSLY. AT MOST, HE'LL GET A SLAP ON THE WRIST, A YEAR'S PROBATION PERHAPS-- HARDLY A DISINCENTIVE. I'M VERY SORRY, PAUL, BUT I CANNOT AFFORD TO LET THIS GO. IT WOULD MAKE ME LOOK WEAK IN FRONT OF MY COLLEAGUES. BUT YOU KNOW IT WASN'T MY FAULT. I CAN'T BLAME YOU TOTALLY, BUT MY ARRANGEMENT WAS WITH YOU AND MIKE. MY SECURITY IS IN YOUR INTEREST IN JASON LAURENCE AND YOUR REAL-ESTATE PROPERTIES. AND NOW, SINCE THE FORMER IS SUSPECT, THE LATTER IS HAVING ITS PROBLEMS, I HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO DEMAND MY MONEY BACK. WELL, WAIT. I CAN'T COME UP WITH THAT KIND OF MONEY JUST LIKE THAT! YOU HAVE 30 DAYS TO COME UP WITH THE CASH... OR PERHAPS YOU CAN FIGURE SOME OTHER SUITABLE AGREEMENT. SUCH AS? YOUR REAL-ESTATE HOLDINGS. WELL, NOT ALL OF THEM, OF COURSE. I'M A REASONABLE MAN. PERHAPS JUST YOUR SOUTH-COAST AND VENTURA PROPERTIES. THOSE ARE OUR MOST VALUABLE PROPERTIES BY FAR, WORTH MILLIONS. NO. YOU OVERESTIMATE THEIR VALUE, ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU MAY BE FORCED TO LIQUIDATE ON SHORT NOTICE. BUT THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE PROBLEM WITH REAL ESTATE. [ENGINE STARTS] [TIRES SCREECHING] HEY! WHAT THE-- WHAT'S GOING ON, GUYS? COME ON. IS THE ROAD NOT BIG ENOUGH OR WHAT? WHAT'S GOING--OOH! JUST HEAR TO LET YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T BE CRYING OVER SPILLED MILK. IT'S NOT HEALTHY. OOH! OOH! A LITTLE MESSAGE FROM JASON LAURENCE-- HE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO CAUSE HIM ANY GRIEF. OOH! YOU'LL LIVE LONGER THAT WAY. LET'S GO, GREG. [ENGINE STARTS] AT LEAST WE KNOW WHAT KIND OF MEN JASON AND THAYER ARE. YEAH. AM I A JERK OR WHAT? DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF. PEOPLE GET TAKEN IN ALL THE TIME. YEAH. WELL... I'M NOT GONNA LET THEM GET AWAY WITH IT. I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING. I WANT TO HELP YOU. IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM. MAYBE IT IS. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE, RIGHT? I'M JASON'S PERSONAL ASSISTANT. WE CAN BE PARTNERS. I WANT TO HELP YOU NAIL JASON. IT COULD GET VERY DANGEROUS. THIS MAN IS CRAZY. WELL, PARTNER, WE'LL JUST HAVE TO MAKE HIM CRAZIER. HEY! HEY! WHAT? COME HERE, YOU! CINDY. [KEY RATTLING IN LOCK] Cindy: MORNING. WHERE'D YOU GET OFF TO? DOWN TO THE MARKET IN LITTLE TOKYO.

PUT THIS ON MY BACK, WILL YOU? IT WOULD BE A PLEASURE. OOH...OOH... THAT FEELS GOOD. HA HA. NOT TOO ROUGH FOR YOU? OH, I LIKE IT ROUGH. OOH, REALLY? HMM... [SNAP] AH! I LIKE THAT IN A WOMAN. OH, REALLY? Carol: WELL, I SEE YOU'VE ALREADY MADE JASON YOUR SLAVE, MOTHER. HE WASN'T TOO DIFFICULT TO RECRUIT. I JUST WANTED JASON TO KNOW THAT WE WERE BEHIND HIM ALL THE WAY... IN ALL THE TROUBLE HE'S BEEN HAVING. WELL, ISN'T THAT NICE? BUT I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT JASON. HE USUALLY GETS HIS WAY. WELL, I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO GIRLS TO FIGHT OVER ME WHILE I TAKE CARE OF SOME BUSINESS. BYE, BABY. [KISS] [SLAP] SO, TELL ME, BABY, IS HE REALLY WORTH FIGHTING FOR? JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE... MOTHER. WELL, I HOPE YOU LIKE THEM SCRAMBLED. IT'S THE ONLY WAY I KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEM. AS LONG AS THEY'RE NOT RUNNY. MMM. HERE YOU GO. BON APPETIT. OH, GREAT. THOSE ARE SOME CUTE PICTURES YOU GOT IN THAT SCRAPBOOK OVER THERE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING GOING THROUGH MY THINGS? I'M NOT GOING THROUGH YOUR THINGS. THE... IT'S SITTING... HEY, IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU'D STAY OUT OF MY PERSONAL STUFF. OK. I CAN DO THAT. YOU CAN DO SOMETHING FOR ME... ON A BUSINESS LEVEL. WHAT? WE NEED TO GET INTO JASON'S OFFICE... SO I CAN LOOK THROUGH HIS PERSONAL STUFF. CAN YOU DO THAT? YEAH. I THINK I COULD DO THAT. CAN YOU GIVE ME A HINT AS TO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR EXACTLY? BANK STATEMENTS, FINANCIAL PAPERS... SOMETHING THAT WILL GIVE US SOME INSIGHT INTO HIS MODUS OPERANDI OF EMBEZZLEMENT. HOW YOU DOING? "SINGLETON-LAURENCE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT." HOW'S THAT? YEAH. THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. BINGO.

I CAN'T WAIT. YOU SEXY ANIMAL. BYE-BYE. [DOOR CLOSES] SO, WHY DON'T WE GET TOGETHER THIS WEEKEND, TALK ABOUT YOUR FUTURE WITH THE COMPANY? SURE. GREAT. BYE. PAUL. HE TOOK THE FILE HOME WITH HIM. WHAT DO WE DO NOW? I KNOW WHERE TO LOOK. [ENGINE STARTS] OK, JASON, WHAT'S GOING ON? I NEVER KNEW YOU WERE GONNA BRING ME HERE. I JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU A BIG PROJECT YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN. WELL, YOU'RE JUST FULL OF ALL KINDS OF SURPRISES, AREN'T YOU? [HUMMING] HA HA HA! WHERE'S CAROL? SHE'S AT THE HAIRDRESSER. SHE'S GONNA BE GONE FOR HOURS. YEAH? MMM... Betty: HA HA HA! WHOO! Jason: I LIKE THIS DRESS, BETTY. OOH, I THOUGHT YOU WOULD. [BETTY MOANING] AH! OH, JASON. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] IT IS SO INCREDIBLY SIMPLE. AND WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT, IN THIS HIGH-TECH AGE? WHAT IS IT? WELL, JASON SET UP BANK ACCOUNTS USING A COUPLE BOGUS COMPANIES, GIVING THE POST OFFICE BOX AS HIS BUSINESS ADDRESS. HE LAUNDERS THE MONEY HE'S RIPPED OFF FROM HIS CLIENTS USING CASHIER'S CHECKS OR MONEY ORDERS. THAT'S IT. THE GUY'S GOT $3 MILLION STASHED AWAY. 3 MILLION? OF COURSE, PART OF THAT IS SINGLETON'S, BUT THE GUY'S DEAD. SO, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH THESE BLANK CHECKS? WE'RE GONNA PAY HIM BACK IN HIS OWN COIN. WE FORGE HIS SIGNATURE, MAKES CHECKS PAYABLE TO BOGUS ACCOUNTS, WHICH WE WILL OPEN. OF COURSE, FOR THAT, WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME FAKE I.D.s.-- LIKE DRIVER'S LICENSES AND, UM...SOCIAL SECURITY CARDS, STUFF THAT'S GONNA FOOL THE CIVIL SERVANT. THAT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD. WE CAN USE SID. BARTENDER? DOES SOME REAL GOOD WORK. Paul: DID SID MENTION WHEN WE'D GET THESE I.D.s BACK? YEAH. IF WE GET THE FILM TO HIM TONIGHT, WE CAN HAVE THEM AS SOON AS TOMORROW. GOOD. HOW DO I LOOK?

GOD, YOU LOOK A MESS. OH, YEAH? WELL, YOU LOOK BALD. HA HA HA! AND RICH. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. WELL, I CAN THINK OF BETTER THINGS TO DO WITH THAT TIE. HMM...SOUNDS LIKE FUN. [LAUGHING] OH, GOD. [TOOLS RATTLING] MMM! SWEETHEART, THAT WAS DELICIOUS. THANK YOU. GRR! YOU REALLY LIKE FLIRTING WITH DANGER, DON'T YOU? I THINK YOU WANT TO GET CAUGHT. DON'T BE SILLY. BUT EVEN IF SHE DID CATCH US, SHE WOULD NEVER BELIEVE IT... NOT OF ME ANYWAY. SHE MIGHT BELIEVE IT OF YOU. INNOCENT ME? YOU KNOW, YOUR MOTHER HAS A VERY LONG LIFE LINE. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A PALM READER. IT'S JUST ONE OF MY MANY HIDDEN TALENTS. IS THERE ANY COFFEE, HONEY? WHY DON'T YOU GO CHECK? OK. MOTHER, I TOLD YOU TO LEAVE HIM ALONE. HONEY, I WAS ONLY TRYING TO CHECK HIM OUT FOR YOU. THERE IS NO OTHER WOMAN. I'M SURE OF IT. HE CHERISHES YOU, HE ADORES YOU, AND HE IS TOTALLY FAITHFUL TO YOU. MOM, DO YOU REALLY THINK SO? YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT WITH JASON. I'M SORRY FOR OVERREACTING. OH, THAT'S OK. HONEY, I THINK I'M GONNA SKIP COFFEE FOR TONIGHT. I'M A LITTLE TIRED. WOULD YOU DRIVE ME HOME? SURE. GOOD NIGHT, JASON. Jason: GOOD NIGHT. DRIVE CAREFULLY. [ENGINE STARTS] [YAWNS DEEPLY] GETTING TIRED? AH, A LITTLE. YOU'LL BE HOME IN A MINUTE. HA HA HA. WHAT'S THE MATTER? THE BRAKE WON'T WORK. [TIRES SCREECH] OH, MY GOD! LOOK OUT! WE'RE GONNA CRASH! [TIRES SCREECH] MOM? MOM? UH! LORRAINE, 232 IS GOING TO BE DISCHARGED. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE PAPERWORK. OK. THANK YOU. MR. LAURENCE, NOW REMEMBER, THAT BANDAGE IS TO COME OFF IN A DAY OR 2, AND THE PAIN MEDICATION IS TO BE GIVEN EVERY 4 HOURS, ALL RIGHT? YEAH. EXCUSE ME, DR. ROSS. MAY I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU? YES, OF COURSE. PARDON ME. THANKS, DOCTOR. WHAT AM I GONNA DO? HEY, YOU HEARD THE DOC. YOU'RE GONNA BE OK. LISTEN, I GOT A GREAT IDEA. HOW ABOUT YOU AND ME FLYING DOWN TO MEXICO? YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO THERE, HUH? HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY THINK I'D WANT TO DO THAT? MY MOTHER IS DEAD, AND I LOOK LIKE THIS. IT'S ALL THERE-- A MILLION DOLLARS... PLUS INTEREST. SO I WOULD ASSUME THAT CONCLUDES OUR BUSINESS TRANSACTION. NOT...QUITE. I HEAR OUR FRIEND CAROL AND HER MOTHER WERE INVOLVED IN A LITTLE AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT THE OTHER NIGHT. THE OLD LADY DIED. REALLY, PAUL, YOUR RESOURCEFULNESS DOES AMAZE ME. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD IT IN YOU. I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. WITH 2 QUESTIONABLE DEATHS AND MY RELATIONSHIP TO THOSE INVOLVED, THE AUTHORITIES MAY SOON DIRECT SOME OF THEIR ATTENTION TOWARDS ME, EVEN THOUGH, LIKE YOU, I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. GET TO YOUR POINT. GIVEN THE TURN OF EVENTS AND THE EMBARRASSMENT THIS IS BOUND TO CAUSE, I BELIEVE I'M ENTITLED TO GREATER COMPENSATION. I WANT YOUR PROPERTIES. SMALL PRICE TO PAY, GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. HA. WELL, THEY'RE NOT GONNA TOUCH YOU, AND YOU KNOW IT! OH, I SEE. HA HA. YOU AND JASON WERE IN THIS TOGETHER FROM THE BEGINNING. HE WAS GONNA GET THE MONEY, AND YOU WERE GONNA GET CONTROL OF THE PROPERTIES AT A FRACTION OF WHAT THEY'RE WORTH. I WILL NOT STAND HERE AND SPAR WITH YOU, PAUL. YOU KNOW, YOU TWO GUYS ARE REALLY AMAZING. JESUS! HOW'D YOU GET INVOLVED WITH A SMALL-TIME PSYCHO LIKE JASON LAURENCE? I MEAN, HIS OPERATION IS PEANUTS COMPARED TO WHAT YOU GUYS MUST BE INVOLVED IN. SOMETIMES IN BUSINESS, YOU MUST DEAL WITH PEOPLE YOU WOULD NEVER INVITE TO YOUR COUNTRY CLUB. HA. OK. [LATCHES CLICK] WELL, THAT BEING THE CASE... GET HIM! [GUNSHOTS] [ENGINE STARTS] THAYER WAS IN IT ALL ALONG, UP TO HIS SCRAWNY LITTLE NECK WITH JASON. JUST ONE BIG SETUP! HE DIDN'T WANT THE MONEY. HE WANTED THE PROPERTY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO. YOU KNOW, THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO MAKE JASON PAY THAN JUST CASH. [SIGHS] WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND? MY BACKUP PLAN, PARTNER. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THESE? OH, YOU DOG, YOU. PRETTY, AIN'T THEY? NOW, I WAS THERE WHEN THEY WERE DOING THAT. WHAT WERE... YOU DOING THERE TAKING PICTURES? SOMETIMES SECRETARIES KNOW MORE ABOUT THEIR BOSSES THAN THEIR WIVES DO. WANT ANOTHER? NO. IT'S TOO EARLY IN THE DAY TO BE DOING THIS ONE. YOU KNOW, YOU GOT ONE HOT LITTLE NUMBER THERE. YOU'RE A LUCKY GUY. YOU KNOW CINDY PRETTY WELL, DON'T YOU? I LIKE HER, BUT YOU KNOW, GIRLS LIKE HER DON'T GO FOR GUYS LIKE ME. YOU KNOW HER A HELL OF A LOT BETTER THAN I EVER WILL. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. SHE'S GOT... THIS DARK SIDE THAT I...I CAN'T GET A HANDLE ON. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? WELL, WHEN YOU SEE YOUR MOTHER KILLED RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, IT KIND OF AFFECTS YOU. HER MOTHER? [DOOR OPENS] Jason: CAROL? WHA--WHAT'S THE MATTER, BABY? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SHOULDN'T YOU BE IN BED? YOU AND MY MOTHER! YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE HUMILIATED ME MORE! [CRYING] WHERE'D YOU GET THIS? WHAT'S THE MATTER? CAN'T THINK OF A GOOD LIE THIS TIME? LOOK, SHE WAS THE ONE WHO WANTED IT, OK? SHE APPROACHED ME. SHE BEGGED ME FOR IT! YEAH, RIGHT. YOU THINK I'D HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH AN OLD HAG LIKE THIS, HUH? YOU DISGUST ME! [TELEPHONE RINGING] YEAH? Woman: MR. LAURENCE, I'M CALLING CONCERNING YOUR CHECK NUMBER 108, MADE OUT TO PORSCHES UNLIMITED. IT'S BEEN RETURNED, AS YOUR ACCOUNT WILL BE OVERDRAWN. OVERDRAWN? HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? I'VE GOT OVER $2 MILLION IN THAT ACCOUNT. I'M SORRY, SIR, BUT OUR RECORDS INDICATE THAT AT THIS MOMENT, YOUR ACCOUNT IS SHOWING A BALANCE OF ONLY $210.23. $210.23? IT'S ALL GONE, ISN'T IT? YOU REALLY ARE PATHETIC. YOU'RE SUCH A LOSER. UH! AH! YOU WITCH! YOU SELFISH SLUT! YOU NEVER CARED ABOUT ME! YOU NEVER CARED ABOUT ME! UH! UH! UH! AH! [GASPING] [GASPING] [GASPING STOPS] BABY. BABY? OH, JEEZ. UH! ["TILT" BEEPS] WAIT HERE. [PINBALL MACHINE BEEPING] [KNOCKS ON WINDOW] IT'S OPEN. YOU REALLY SHOULD KEEP YOUR DOORS LOCKED. YOU NEVER KNOW WHO JUST MIGHT ACCIDENTALLY STROLL IN. CAROL? CAROL? CA-- WHAT HAPPENED? IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. OH, GOD, MORRIS, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU OUR LITTLE ARRANGEMENT WAS A MISTAKE. I SEE THAT I'M RIGHT. I WANT MY MONEY BACK. THAT'S NOT OUR DEAL. I KNOW YOU HAD SINGLETON KILLED JUST SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO GIVE HIM HIS MEASLY SHARE. WHAT DID YOU DO, HIRE SOME HOOKER FRIEND OF YOURS TO ROUGH HIM UP, SCARE HIM A LITTLE MORE THAN USUAL, KNOWING HE HAD A PROBLEM WITH HIS HEART? THE MAN WAS DYING. WHAT'S THE POINT OF GIVING THE MONEY TO A DEAD MAN? I DON'T NEED DEALING WITH A PSYCHO. I WANT MY MONEY BACK RIGHT NOW. I DON'T HAVE IT. GOD, MORRIS, YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME! OH, NO? TRY ME. LOOK...THE MONEY'S NOT HERE. IT'S... IT'S IN THE BANK. ALL RIGHT. THEN WE'LL GO TO THE BANK TOGETHER. LET'S GO. I'LL BE WAITING IN THE CAR. MORRIS. YOU'RE JUST LIKE THE REST. Paul: NOW... WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE TELLING ME? I HAD TO DO SOMETHING. I JUST WANTED TO TRASH THE PORSCHE. THE SON OF A GUN BOUGHT IT WITH OUR MONEY! OH, MIKE. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE JASON DRIVING. I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT CAROL AND BETTY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING ANYMORE. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. LET'S NOT GET HYSTERICAL. COME ON. COME ON. GO HOME. WE'LL THINK ABOUT IT. I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL. COME ON. I'LL WALK YOU TO YOUR CAR. [ENGINE STARTS] [TIRES SCREECHING] MIKE! YOU SON OF A-- [TIRES SCREECHING] UH! AAH! HA HA HA! MIKE. Man: SO WHY'D THE YUPPIE CROSS THE ROAD? HE WANTED TO NETWORK WITH THE CHICKEN. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. I GOT MORE. I GOT LOTS MORE. I GOT LOTS MORE. UH...OK, WHAT'S THE IDEAL WOMAN? HUH? RIGHT? SHE'S DEAF, DUMB, BLIND, A NYMPHOMANIAC, AND AT MIDNIGHT, SHE TURNS INTO A PIZZA AND A SIX-PACK. COME ON. THIS IS GREAT MATERIAL, MAN. LOOSEN UP A BIT. COME ON. I KILLED WITH THIS STUFF AT THE CLUB. MAN, I KILLED. I MURDERED THEM. I GOT ONE FOR YOU. WATCH. IT'S A VISUAL THING. VISUAL THING. HERE WE GO. WHAT'S THIS, HUH? WHAT'S THAT? A TOURIST IN KUWAIT. HA HA HA. COME ON, LOOSEN UP, MAN. THIS IS GOOD. UM... I GOT A GREAT ONE FOR YOU. YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS ONE. YOU HEARD ABOUT THE INDIAN LOTTERY? YOU SCRATCH OFF THE TICKET. IF THE DOT ON THE TICKET MATCHES THE DOT ON YOUR FOREHEAD, YOU WIN A 7-11. WHAT DO YOU THINK? SHUT UP. ALL RIGHT. CINDY. UP HERE. MIKE'S DEAD. JASON KILLED CAROL. HE KILLED THAYER. IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE HE FINDS HIS WAY TO US. GET YOUR THINGS. WE GOT THE MONEY. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. YOU TAKE THE MONEY, PAUL. I'VE GOT SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS. I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOUR UNFINISHED BUSINESS. AUDREY LANSING WAS YOUR MOTHER. SHE WAS KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT, AND YOU SOMEHOW THINK THAT JASON WAS INVOLVED. NOT "THINK." I KNOW. I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES. BUT NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE AN 8-YEAR-OLD. I WANT HIM TO HURT AS MUCH AS HE HURT ME. BUT HE IS HURTING. DON'T YOU SEE THAT? WE HAVE FINANCIALLY DECIMATED THIS MAN. HE'S RUINED. BUT IT'S ALL GOTTEN OUT OF HAND. HE'S GONE NUTS. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE AND LET THE MAN HANG HIMSELF. WHEN HE HANGS, I WANT TO BE HERE TO SEE IT. HOW CHARMING. MY PARTNER AND MY ASSISTANT. HAPPY TO SEE YOU TWO GETTING ALONG SO WELL. LET ME SEE IF I GOT THE STORY RIGHT, HUH? THE LOVEBIRDS RIP OFF THE BIG, BAD JASON AND DISAPPEAR HAPPILY INTO THE SUNSET, HUH? WRONG! YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME BACK EVERY CENT...NOW! I DON'T HAVE IT. DO I REALLY LOOK THAT STUPID? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M GONNA DO. I'M GONNA COUNT TO 3, AND THEN I'M GONNA BLOW HER PRETTY LITTLE HEAD RIGHT OFF. ONE-- THIS IS BETWEEN YOU AND ME. SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. HOLD IT RIGHT THERE! IT'S ON THE ROOF, JASON! THE MONEY'S ON THE ROOF! YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM ME! YOU LOSE, PAUL. NO, YOU DO, JASON. THAT WAS FOR MY MOTHER. [DISTANT SIREN]
