(PANTING) God damn it! Your last words last night. The very first words you greet me with this morning. Don't you think you ought to do something about expanding your vocabulary? Yeah, while you expand your chest. Didn't you get enough exercise jogging this morning? Don't you ever get tired? I don't think I'm gonna have time for breakfast this morning. Why not? It's ready. Denise Marshall's boy asked me for an autographed football. I'm gonna drop it off on the way to the office. An autographed football from you. (LAUGHING) And you haven't played football in 16 years. Well, I guess it's part of this nostalgic binge everybody's on. Anyway, it's the ball Frank Gifford signed. That's the signature he really wants. You know, I find it peculiar. Almost amusing. The widow Brian Marshall comes back into town after seven months, and you rush off without even so much as a cup of coffee. But if I ask you... If you ask me to stop off at the market to pick up a head of lettuce for you, I'd find some excuse. Christ! (SIGHS) You know, if it wasn't 7:30 in the morning, I would have a drink. I didn't know you were a clock-watcher. What? What did you say? I said, I didn't know you were a clock-watcher. Don't you dare lower your voice to me. Look, what's this all about? I know you. I've been married to you long enough. I know the more contempt you feel for me, the lower the voice. Hell, Remy, you'd hardly call this a marriage, would you? Going now, Remy. I said, I'm leaving. Remy. Remy. (WHEEZING) Remy. (EXHALES) (WHEEZING) Remy! Remy. (SIGHS) Jim? Stewart Graff. She's done it again. Yeah, I think we'll get faster action if you call the ambulance. (RAGGED BREATHING) Well, of course I'll induce vomiting. I know the rules by now. Just get over here, will you? (RUMBLING) Oh! Oh, my God. Oh! Oh. (RUMBLING STOPS) Oh. If you're going to throw the pills in the toilet, you might at least flush it. (RUMBLING) Man, that was a jolt. You can forget your coffee. We got an emergency inspection to run. I'm off duty in half an hour. It was just a little tremor. That's a solid concrete dam. Well, those are the rules, Max. You can always use the overtime. Yeah, I suppose so. (ENGINE STARTS) CARETAKER: Is everything okay? ASSISTANT: Yeah. Why don't you check the base? I'll look down below. NEWSREADER ON RADIO: At 7:46 this morning, a minor earthquake registering 3.1 on the Richter scale was felt in the Los Angeles area. No injuries were reported. However, minimal property damage... Repeating a KJB Sig Alert. Hello, Laura? This is Mr. Graff. My secretary in yet? Yeah. Well, tell her I'll be a little late, huh? All right, Mr. Graff, I'll tell her. Let me speak to him. Oh, Mr. Graff? Just a moment, it's your father-in-law. Stewart, see me as soon as you come in. I want to go over that Bill Cameron matter again. Sam, I'm not gonna budge on this. I don't want to lose this contract. I'll talk to you about it later. Thank you. Yes, sir. Fred? Fred? (EXCLAIMS) Fred! Fred! Fred? (GRUNTING) (SIREN WAILING) (TIRES SCREECHING) Watch it, Lew. You nearly wrecked us up in that last turn. (TIRES SCREECHING) You see? I told you. We're gonna hear about that one. Want to drive, Emilio? No,no,no. You're driving. You're driving. We're over the city line. The Captain will bust our rumps if we mess up here in the county again. Do you remember what happened with that guy Merle? I still don't think his gun went off by accident. I get along just fine with nine toes. (SIREN CONTINUES WAILING) I told you to stay out of the county, you bastard. Merle... Some guys are just too goddamned dumb to stay where they belong. Do you know who owns that hedge you just wrecked? I'm gonna tell you, Slade. It's Zsa Zsa Gabor. Com], forget about the (fishes. You'll be late for school Come on. And remember to go to Mrs. Clark's when you come back, huh? She'll look after you until I'm home from the studio. (DOOR BELL BUZZING) Stewart! Hi. Come on in. Hi. You brought it. Sorry I forgot it last week. Where did Frank Gifford sign? Right there under the laces. Yeah. Thanks, Mr. Graff. That'll look great on my bookcase. That's really nice of you. Thank you. Couldn't let down my last fan. (CHUCKLES) Hurry. Okay, have a good day. Goodbye. Mom. Bye-bye- GRAFF: So long. You know what? GRAFF: What? I've got a part in a movie. Oh, great. Yeah, great. Three days shooting, 22 lines. It's hard. I've been out of it so long. Well, at least I feel alive again, and I didn't for so long after Brian died. Yeah. Well. I guess I should get dressed. Hey, did you feel that tremor this morning? It really wasn't very strong. No? Would you like some coffee? Yeah. If there's an unbroken cup somewhere that I can find. It'll have to be instant. Yeah, well, instant will be fine. You know, Barbara says you're the best... Barbara? Barbara. Your boss's secretary. Oh. And my one good friend. Well, she says you're the best engineer in the country. Yeah, well, Barbara's paid to say things like that. Oh. Oh, that's the script of the movie I'm doing. "Movie I'm doing." That's the overstatement of the year. Here I am, two small scenes, and I'm so worried, I'm so nervous. I was up all night trying to figure out how to make this damn thing work. (CHUCKLES) Can I help you? Yes. You could read the lines with me. It's just one scene. One page. I think I know it. Right here, near the top. (CLEARS THROAT) Okay, let me fill you in. I play a bit player. Now, the part you read is a big movie star. A drunk, a gambler, married 18 times, the whole thing. And there's a dinner party. Now, an assistant director invited me, only he's not enough of a, whatever, gentleman, to pick me up. I have to drive myself. Well, that's okay. Now, they're all talking about me just before I come in. You know, asking him the usual questions about bit players. Talk, talk, talk, talk. I come in. Introductions, introductions, introductions. Then our big star, you, makes his appearance. You ignore me, for quite a while. So, I say to you, "Hello, Mr. Sheppard. "It's been a long time. How have you been?" And you say... "Do we know each other?" "You bet your ass we do." That kind of a script. (CHUCKLES) Oh. And the character I'm playing is also supposed to be a nymphomaniac. Mmm-hmm. Yeah? And the director of the picture is a strong believer in typecasting. But anyway, I'll cope with that. You want it black? Yeah. Black's... And don't worry. Worry about what? I'm not a nympho. Mind you, I'm not Mary Poppins, either, but I'm far from being... What's the male equivalent of a nympho? Satyr, I think. Satyr? Oh. Yeah. And you don't need to worry, either. Worry? What I mean is, I'm not Billy Graham exactly, but I'm no satyr. Mmm-hmm. Jesus, that tremor must've stopped the clock. It's a little after 9:00. And I have a 10:00 call. I'm sorry, I've got to run. I'm overdue at the office. Listen. Thank you for everything. I mean, the cueing, the football and the sympathy. And as Mary Poppins would say, "Bye-bye." (CHUCKLES) Eight stitches to close his lower lip, six loosened teeth. You aren't supposed to do things like that to a brother officer. Not a brother officer, sir. Merle is a county cop. I'm talking about Los Angeles cops and county cops. That kid stole a car. Then he got stoned and he slammed into a little girl. A little Mexican girl, about six years old. That little girl was thrown about 15 feet in the air. She was probably dead before she hit the sidewalk. Her blood covered three whole cement squares. Not spattered. Solid. Just like paint. The driver never even slowed down. And he almost got away because some peckerwood rich man's whore in a cop's uniform was worried about a hedge! You will receive a formal notice of suspension. And a date for departmental trial. Now, get on home. Hey, Lew, how'd it go? (MACHINES RATTLING) JOHNSON: Michelle, get me the Valley reading. MICHELLE: Okay. Have they plotted the epicenter yet? Yes, sir, it was quite a shock. Yes. Yes. Nevertheless, there's no scientific evidence that a 3.1 earthquake can loosen dental fillings. No. Right. Thank you. Walt! Your turn on the PR desk. Yes, that's right. Dr. Adams. Room 14. He isn't? Well then I'd like to leave a message. JOHNSON: Walt! Just a minute, okay? Would you have him call Walter Russell at the Seismology Institute? Yeah, it's very important. Yes, thank you. Here's a strange one. "Caretaker at the Hollywood reservoir dam "drowned at the bottom of an elevator shaft." They still haven't figured out what happened. Okay. What's the matter? You look sick. I just found out Dr. Adams stayed up at the fault an extra day. So? Well, I sent some figures and a memo into the Director's office late yesterday afternoon. I don't think he's even read them yet. Figures on what? Well, I know you'll laugh, but I think we're gonna have a really big quake. Probably today. Tomorrow at the latest. And I wanted Dr. Adams here to back up my computations. Thought you were leaving yesterday, Dr. Adams. We've been held up. But we hope to have most of the instruments planted by noon. Still haven't figured out exactly what it is you fellas are trying to do. It's rather technical. That device records minute variations of seismic waves. MR. GRIGGS: Huh. Well, better start my plowing. ADAMS: Thanks again for letting us on your land, Mr. Griggs. Once the trench is filled in, you'd never have known we were here. (SHEEP BLEATING) Well? That was nice. Real nice. Yeah, tell me this, you gonna have this thing ready for this afternoon? I'll have it ready, don't worry. But I think we'll need an extra can of butane there. Come on, Sal, huh? We'll pick one up when we go for Rosa this afternoon, all right? All right. What I want to know is, are you gonna get her to help us? Yeah, yeah, she'll help us. Well, she's not too crazy about our line of work, man. Miles, I'll get her. Well, you better, because this Vegas job is the biggest break we ever had. Miles, I'll get her. I'll get her. What do you want? Will you relax? All right. Jesus! Wow. Seventy-three. Five forty-nine. Eighty-nine. Eighty-nine. That'll be 20.16. Forgot to bring enough cash? That's right. Hey, I'll put this back. Who needs protein anyway? Don't worry about it. Drop the money off the next time you're in. Thanks. MAN: Find anything? All okay as far as I can tell! I'll check again! I guess we won't find anything until after the shaft is pumped out. But everything looks fine. Right. People drown in elevators every damn day of the week. (MUSIC PLAYING) (DEVOTEES SINGING) Officer, can you order these freaks out of here? They've been scaring my customers away, and I've been trying to get them to leave. You got something against religion? What'“ you have? Double bourbon, Jay. In uniform, Lew? Naked in a glass will do just fine. Spiro T. Agnew. You asked to see me, Dr. Stockle? Sit down. Russell, this is very interesting. You forecast an earthquake in the three to four point range this morning. We had an earthquake in the three to four point range this morning. I'm impressed. Thank you, sir. However, isn't it rather slender evidence for predicting a catastrophe? Sir, these are based on this morning's signals from those stress measurement instruments that Dr. Adams sank during that experimental well project. They indicate another pre-shock, probably before noon today. And if it happens? Then the big one follows in 48 hours. At least seven point. Now, naturally, if that second minor shock doesn't occur, then it just proves that my computations were based on insufficient evidence. But I think we have a strong... Russell, you are still a graduate assistant. Are you seriously contending that a graduate assistant would be the first scientist in history to pinpoint a major earthquake within 48 hours? No, sir. But I am following through on Dr. Adam's theories and the probability curves that he drew up. But I feel that I've been on the project... Dr. Adams is on a field trip upstate. I sure wish he wasn't. Thank you, Russell. Leave those. Fiona, I want some figures run through the computer. And try to get Frank Adams for me in Fresno. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yeah? Morning, Sam. Morning, Stew. Listen, you still refuse to handle the Bill Cameron job unless he upgrades the specifications? Absolutely. Okay. But you're gonna have to convince him that those changes are necessary. I could never talk him into anything. Oh, do me one more favor, huh? Don't muff the deal. Oh, just a moment. Mr. Royce, your daughter's on the phone, 347. Thank you. He'll be right on. Remy? Hello, Remy. Fine. Well, I was planning on eating here in the building. Well, come on in. REMY: No, away from the office. Oh, it's terribly important. Oh. Okay, honey. The Windsor at 1:15? And try to calm down. Okay. SEISMOLOGIST: Bill, here comes another one. (RUMBLING) It's a pretty good shake. Oh, shit! Hey, that shot didn't count. No way can it count. Hey, nothing in the rule book about eatlh quakes.. It didn't count. Yeah, it did. CHAVEZ: Hardly ever get two in one morning. Two what? Earthquakes. (PLAYERS GRUNTING) In another half hour, I won't feel the one that's supposed to knock California into the ocean. (ALL GRUNTING) The Captain's cooled off. He's gonna do his damnedest to straighten things out. I don't want to be a cop anymore. Right since the time I was a kid, I figured on cops helping folks, you know? Folks who couldn't help themselves. All right, maybe that was dumb of me, but that's the way I figured. But folks don't count for a diddly, do they? (PLAYERS SHOUTING) Take it easy, now. I'll call you at home later. Sure, Emilio. (BOTH GRUNTING) The shot counted. Bobby Riggs. That wasn't there before the tremor. I know every inch of this dam. It's a new one. Max, I'm a trained technician. You're a watchman. Now, stop trying to teach me my business. It wasn't there. There's no such thing as solid concrete and you know it. Hairline cracks are bound to appear from time to time. You don't panic over them. The water's rising. It's gone up half an inch since the quake. He's right. What the hell is going on? JOHNSON: But it could all be coincidence. I don't see running wild over some untested theory, at least until we've heard from Frank Adams. After all, it's his research project, and not Walt's. No one can find Frank Adams. No one was sure the atom bomb would work until they dropped it. It worked. Our present problem is what in God's name do we do now? Well, we warn people. Do we? Think about it. A public announcement now that a major earthquake is imminent, that could create incredible panic. People climbing over people trying to get out of the city. That could be a worse disaster than the quake itself. But an orderly evacuation could save hundreds of thousands of lives. An orderly evacuation to Where? The desert? The mountains? How do you feed and shelter four million people in open country? And suppose we release this information and there isn't a big quake? Well, what's the point in learning how to predict an earthquake, if you don't do anything about it after you predict it? Russell! Russell, look! Dr. Johnson and I are not cynical. But a false alarm now, even if it went no further than the Mayor or the Governor's office, would destroy the institute's credibility. Credibility! LOOK. Russell! Four or five years from now, we come up with a foolproof detection system. Who in authority is gonna believe us then? (TELEPHONE BUZZES) Yeah? No. No, no, don't call his wife. I'll take care of it myself. Frank Adams is dead. So's young Ward. They were working in a trench across the fault. The walls collapsed. Fiona, get me the Mayor's office. It's a matter of gravest urgency. See if you can push the blueprint room on those revised drawings for the Cameron job, will you, Carl? He'll want to see them this afternoon. Okay, Stewart. I've got to get out of here for a while. This place is closing in on me. Hi. You finished working already? Never got started. Would you believe it? The tremor damaged the set, and they rescheduled my scene for tomorrow. So, I thought I'd drop in on Barbara. Something wrong? No, I need a drink. Oh. Are you one of those solitary drinkers? Not if I can help it. Would you join me? Yes. Yes. ROYCE: Do you realize what you're asking of me? What's really happening with you two? He's been seeing Brian Marshall's widow. Well, of course. He feels obligated to help her out. Her and her boy. Oh, Albert Schweitzer wasn't that dedicated to mankind. There's more to it, Remy. It was Stewart who assigned Brian that propane cavern job, and he's been blaming himself for what happened ever since. Oh, Dad, don't be so naive. I know they're having an affair. When you met Stewart, he was a dirt-poor boy trying to work his way through college on an athletic scholarship. I think you still half see him that way. But he's a top man now. He doesn't need me, he doesn't need anybody. There isn't a firm in town wouldn't take him on his own terms. How big a quake? A seven on the Richter scale, possibly higher. That could release more than the total energy generated by the Hiroshima, Nagasaki nuclear bombs combined. If i issue a public warning, you know what will happen to this city? Of course we know, that's impossible. But there are some precautions you could take, aren't there? Alert the police, the fire department. Have the Governor mobilize the National Guard. Well, he could announce that it's necessary to prevent looting at the Valley quake site. Well, the police have that situation totally under control. Mayor Lewis, the next situation, if it comes, would be somewhat different. The Governor and I aren't even in the same party. If this turns out to be a false alarm, he'll make me look like the biggest fool west of the Mississippi. Second biggest. I'll top the list. What do you say, Lew? Hey, Rosa... Hiya, pal. ...the ladies room is through that door and a couple of steps to the right. You still pursuing those evildoers? Not as hard as usual. MILES: Hey, Jay, we want a couple of burgers and some orange juice to go. JAY: Two burgers and orange juice to go. The 50 bucks, Miles. You owed me for three weeks. Hey, listen, man. What if I pay you tomorrow. Okay? Hey, the 50. You're a great bike rider but a lousy pool shooter. Officer, I mean, you're not gonna let him get away with this, are you? Yes. Fifty bucks, or I'll break your back. Peter Fonda. Listen... Peter Fonda... Hey, hey, Sal. Hey, wait. Here. Take it. Yeah, I'll take it. Thanks. Brother. Mother. SAL: Miles, what're you doing? All I've got is a dollar and some loose change on me. Hey, Lew, hey, come on. Lend me 10 bucks, huh? I don't have time to go to the bank. You better stop breathing those gas fumes so much. Hey, listen, Lew, this is an emergency, man. We need a butane tank for the stunt. That son of a bitch just left me 10 bucks short. Look,I'll have it back to you tomorrow. I promise. Come on, Lew. This is really important to me. This big guy is coming down from one of the big Vegas hotels to see this act. Now, there has never ever been anything like this. If that hotel sponsors us, man, I could wind up on ABC's Wide World of Sports, man. And after that, you can forget about Evel Knievel. It'll be just the Miles Quade Story. You know, I'm sorry I ever arrested you two. I've been paying for it ever since. Hello. Rosa, I want you to meet Lew Slade. He's the cop who flattened Miles and I with a blackjack at the North Hollywood rally last year. Hey, that's right. And we didn't even start that ruckus. Well, you should've knocked their brains into place. Come here, Rosa. I want to talk to you. Come here. Listen. If I had the bread, I would hire a beautiful, sexy broad this afternoon, and I would kick your ass all the way home. Well, I don't need your help. Bye. Now, Rosa, will you listen to me? Daredevil motorcyclists always have to have beautiful, sexy broads hanging around. Rosa, that's right. What do you want, us to look like phonies or what? Sal, I'm your sister. What about Maureen? She's your girlfriend. Come on, Rosa. Maureen is too flat-chested. Rosa, come here. Now, Rosa, I want you to show the officer your t-shirt. Oh, yeah, Lew, take a look at this. We're gonna have 20, maybe 30,000 of these made up after the Vegas show. Go ahead, take a look. See what you think of it. I think it's beautiful. GRAFF: My wife will ask me, "Is she pretty?" I'll say, "Quite." And she'll say, something like, "That figures. Tell me about her." And you'll say, "Nothing much to tell. We just had a drink." And she'll ask me, "No small talk?" "Very little. A trait that goes with engineering." Yeah, maybe it does. It's good. Can I ask you something? Sure. Anything. When we made love, when you made love to me, it was with such... Such”. I'm trying to think of exactly the right word. It was with such... Anger. Anger? Yeah, anger. (SCOFFS) Did I anger you? No. I think you are absolutely lovely. Well, I think so, too. I'm not hurt. Tell me, how long has Barbara worked at the office? Oh, 10, 12 years. Well, did you ever know me to drop in on her before? No. Certainly not since you got back to LA. Well, maybe I didn't want to see Barbara. Maybe I wanted to see you. Hmm? How about that? Yeah. How about that? So, you didn't seduce me. I seduced you. Great. Well, next time I'll do the honors. Oh, don't feel there has to be a next time. Don't think that you just made a lifelong commitment. Come here. Why? Come here. I have to go to Oregon this summer. All summer on a hydroelectric project. Come up there, with Corry. I'll rent a house for the two of you. It's such beautiful, really beautiful country. It'd be great for him. Please. I'll think about it. I'll come back tonight. I'll think about that, too. ANNOUNCER ON RADIO: We interrupt our regular program to bring you a special bulletin. The Governor has just announced that the following National Guard units have been put on emergency active duty status. The Fourth Infantry support group, the 227th Heavy Transport Battalion, the 112th Headquarters Company, the 33rd Communications Battalion, the 47th Engineers Company. WOMAN: Oh, my God. Let me show you What's happening. First of all, we start up there. Then it's down that ramp, like hell into that first big loop, up this ramp, zoom over the truck, down this ramp and straight into that big figure eight. Then it's down that ramp right into that fire ring. Now, that fire ring doesn't just have flames on the outside, like in your dog acts. No, no, we rigged those gas jets to shoot flames right in the center. Then it's down that ramp, over that pit, and we're home free. Now, you take a guy like Knievel. Now, he'll jump 20, maybe 30 cars, and call it a big goddamn thing. (LAUGHS) But, baby, let me tell you something, compared to those, landing on a roof of a car at 100 miles an hour, that's like landing in a water bed. (ALL LAUGHING) Miles, you're out of your mind. Hey. but. Rosa, wait a minute. No. No. way. If you want to help your best friend kill himself, fine. Rosa, listen. Now, listen. Don't be rotten. There's nothing to it. It is simple! Who do you think you're kidding? I'm going to a movie. ROSA: Clint Eastwood at the Royal. MILES: Rosa, wait a minute. (SAYING GOODBYE IN ITALIAN) You're gonna fix it up. All right, all right, all right. She's nervous. She's... Yeah. sure. Where's them cantaloupes? We asked you for some free cantaloupes, Jody. Say, my friend, what kind of friend are you? Still playing soldier boy, Jody? That's right. We saw on television where you're gonna go play soldier boy. Say, say, say. Say, say, say. Is it true that blondes have more fun? Oh, no. Look at that. I told you he was a fag. Say, Jody, you a fag? If I'd known you was a fag, Jody, I'd have been up here before. I could've used the money. (ALL CHUCKLING) Fall in! Hey. yo. Left, right. Left, right. Ho. Hup. Hup. Let's decorate the warrior. SANDY: Eyes straight to the front, soldier. Quit looking around. GRAFF: Now the motion in this model was programmed from the actual recorded ground motion of a 6.2 earthquake. Long Beach in '33. Now, a magnitude of eight would produce a motion... What's your point? Bill, we live in an earthquake zone. What can I tell you? That I've failded to meet city or state safety requirements? That's not the point. I think we should go beyond the codes. You remember the Sylmar quake. A lot of buildings that met the code collapsed.. You know how much money I pour into this company every year? You bet I do. And you're willing to risk losing my business for something like this? Yes, I am. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) The revised prints on the interior are in my office, Mr. Cameron. I figured you'd want to go over them. I'll see what it costs me. And I thought you were gonna chew me out for leaning on Bill Cameron. Oh, I just figured it was time I kicked myself upstairs. And I always like the feel of that name, "Chairman of the Board." Has a nice ring. Congratulations, Mr. President. (LAUGHS) Jesus! (BOTH CHUCKLING) Thanks, Sam. Oh, listen. You're gonna have to forget about that Oregon project, I guess. We can't have a new company president pouring cement out in the woods somewhere. What's the matter? Look, I just promoted you. I didn't fire you. No, Sam, you're gonna figure I'm crazy, but I'd like a little time to think this over. Okay. Any problems I ought to know about? No. Just a few priorities I've got to get straight in my head. Sure. Sam, Remy didn't have anything to do with this, did she? Don't worry. You'd have this job even if you weren't my son-in-law. (PHONE RINGING) Oh, hold that. Hello? GRAFF: Hello. Denise? Stewart. Hi. Look. I'm not gonna be able to make it tonight. Something important came up at work. Any trouble? No. No trouble. I've just got a problem to solve. I'm sorry. I'm sorrier than you are. Oh, it doesn't matter about tonight. We'll have lots of time together up in Oregon. Okay? Bye-bye. Goodbye. CORRY: Mom? Mom. (DOG BARKING) Yeah? Okay if I go to the playground? Sure. Just be careful crossing that bridge,huh? And, Corry, if I'm not home when you get back, don't worry. I might take a walk later. If leave the kitchen door unlocked. I think I'll make a practice run. Loosen up the machine. All right, Sal. Miles! Jesus! (GRUNTING) (GROANING) Miles, you all right? Huh? Came out of that damn thing. What happened? Huh? Come on, help me try again. Listen to me, Miles. We only have one 250 left. You understand me? Huh? What're you talking about. man? I gotta try it again! Okay. Okay, you're the boss. Come on. (ENGINE REWING) All right, Miles, come on, baby. Come on! Come on! Let her roll! ...delay in the contract, I suggest... Barbara. Mmm-hmm? You knew Brian Marshall? Yes. Ever meet his wife? Sure. We see each other all the time. What's she like? She's a very nice girl. Yes. I was afraid of that. (INTERCOM BUZZES) Yes? LAURA: Mr. Royce, your daughter's on the way into your office. Fine. Remy. Good afternoon, Mrs. Graff. REMY: Hello, Barbara. Have you spoken to Stewart yet? Yes. He said he wanted to think about it. Miles, here he comes now. The guy from Vegas. Oh, baby. This is gonna be the greatest run of my life. I'm tuned to just the right pitch. (BOTH LAUGHING) Now, you go on home and put this right out of your mind. You look exhausted. Thanks,Dad. Sam, I... Hello, Remy. Well,I guess you've got yourself a new president. Great! And you'll stay away from that Marshall woman? (SIGHS) Stewart. Stewart, wait. Stewart, where are you going? Anywhere. A bar. Why are you so angry? Remy, don't you understand? That was a bribe. Another bribe! Our whole marriage has been a series of bribes. And you took them. Well, it's time I quit. You're really going to see that Marshall bitch, aren't you? Not till tonight. Oh, finally you admit the truth. It wasn't the truth until today. It was never the truth! It is now. Bastard! REMY: I'm not that stupid. (DOGS BARKING) (DOGS WHINING) (BIRDS SQUAWKING) Hey. Finally found the trouble. I guess the earthquake busted the conduit and it's flooded the bottom of the shaft. (LOUD RUMBLING) (ALL EXCLAIMING) (ALL CLAMORING) Get down! (ALL SCREAMING) WOMAN: Oh, my God! (PEOPLE SHOUTING) (ALL SCREAMING) (GASPING) (SCREAMING) (MOOING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (GRUNTS) (ALL SCREAMING) (ALL GROANING) WOMAN: Holy mother of God! (ALL SCREAMING) Help me! Oh, God, help me! Help! MAN: What is she doing? (LOUD RUMBLING) WOMAN: What's happening? (ALL SCREAMING) (SCREAMS) (GROANS) (PEOPLE SHOUTING) (WOMAN SHOUTING) Oh, God! Mother! Mother! (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) MAN: Turn off the gas! (RUMBLING STOPS) (PEOPLE GROANING) GRAFF: Oh, my God! Stay here. (SIRENS WAILING) MAN 1: Help. (PEOPLE GROANING) MAN 2: Is there a doctor around here? Barbara. Barbara! Barbara! Mr. Cameron threw me out of the elevator. And then I heard all those people screaming!

We really got problems. Thank God we had mobile units to bring in. Let's get to the control panel. MAN: Fires out of control, Van Nuys Hospital, all roads blocked between Victory and Kittridge. Is there any way I can broadcast to the whole city, get picked up on transistor sets? There's a few commercial stations on the quake fringe area still operating. We might be able to rig a microwave relay to one of them. Well, get on it, then. SLADE: Hey, you, come here. Help this guy, damn it! Slide him out from under there. Hey, who do you have to know to get a drink around here? Shut off that gas valve. WOMAN: Help me. Help me. (WOMAN GROANING) Help me. Help me. INSPECTOR: You guys, check that edge. Both sides.

Not Without official permission, you're not. (SIGHS) It's dead. I told you to leave that alone. The city's gonna need every drop of water it can get. There's dozens of fires down there already. If this dam busts, there won't be nothing between here and Wilshire Boulevard left to burn. The quake may have broken something inside. (GRUNTS) It won't budge. It won't budge. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) ROYCE: Stewart, you'd better get out of here. The whole building is full of phosgene. You'd better get out, too. Maybe there's some way down through an elevator shaft. Shut the door. It's giving. I've got it. (BOTH COUGHING) Shut it. Get me... Get me a chair, with arms. All right, put it down there. (CLAMORING) Pull it all the way. Here, hold this.

Miles. put him right here. MILES: Here we go. Where are we gonna take him, huh? There's no hospital for miles. I guess we better head for the police station. Yeah. Yeah, let's go. WOMAN 1: How can I find out about my daughter? She's in County Hospital. MAN 1: My store. The whole front is gone. You've got to help me protect it. MAN 2: Why aren't the firemen here yet? WOMAN 2: Please, help me find a doctor. My husband's legs are broken. Now, look... Stop! You're all gonna have to help yourselves. Most of the police in this district were killed in that station house. And the guys that were on patrol when the quake hit, well, they probably got more to do than they can handle. Now, look, you get as many volunteers as you can. Go to that hardware store over there. Now, if it's locked, break in. Find as many picks and shovels as you can. And start looking for people who are buried alive. There are plenty of 'em, believe me. Give him a hand. Move your ass! Come on, let's go. Now, I want all the women and the kids who have houses in any kind of shape at all, to go to them and to stay there. Now, turn off all the gas lines... Hey, I'm getting something. ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, stand by for a message from the Mayor of Los Angeles. MAYOR: This city has suffered the greatest natural disaster in the history of the United States. The state and the nation are rallying to our aid. But for the next few hours, until massive help can reach us, we will have to depend on our own physical and spiritual resources. Private physicians should report to emergency aid stations, now being set up at key sites throughout the city. Bring all the medical supplies you can carry. Clinics have been established in the following locations, the Hollywood Bowl, the Occidental Insurance building, the Wilson Plaza... Laura! Laura, my father? Is he all right? My father! Laura, my father! God! Go on. Come on, you're next. Move. (GRUNTING) (WHEEZING) (GROANS) You all right? Sam, why didn't you go ahead of some of the younger guys? Staying up here was crazy. (BOTH COUGHING) I don't think I'm strong enough to lower you all the way by myself. So, get ready for a jolt. (EXCLAIMS) (COUGHING) Let's get out of here. Give me your hand, will you? Watch yourself. Okay. Easy. Easy. Do you know Denise Marshall, Barbara? Yes. See if you can get to a phone, find out if she's all right. Are the phones working? Try. please! Come on, let's get out of here. Officer, are the phones working? Nowhere. Out all over the city. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Hey, Lew. Miles? Look, we got a hurt kid in the back. He's in shock. Well, all we can do is keep him warm until we can get up to a doctor. Here. You figure you can find your way to Wilson Plaza in this heap? They got an emergency medical station set up down there. I got to find my sister Rosa. She went to the movies. We've got a lot of injured to move and you're gonna move them in this. And I'm gonna stay here. Come on, now give me the bike. I've got to find Rosa. Listen, just do what he says. I'll find Rosa on the bike. I can get around better than anybody. Okay. Move out. Single file. MAN: Got it. WOMAN: Over there! There's a store open over there! MAN 1: Okay. Hey, grab the cash! WOMAN: Okay! MAN 2: This way! MAN 3: Let's go, this way. Hey, you all. Over here. Let's go. Hey, get away from that cash register. I was just trying to get home and I was hungry. Look, I'd like to let you go, miss, but we have strict orders on looters. They're all supposed to be placed under arrest. I was just hungry... And no exceptions. Now, come on, let's go. Come on. OFFICER ON MEGAPHONE: Cars must leave the garage area after dropping off patients. Hot coffee and food is available in basement shopping levels two and three. Please keep moving. Move right along. Please keep moving. More doctors are waiting at the first garage level.

Stewart! Denise and her boy will need help, too. I've got to try and find them. Is she more important than me? Than our life together? Than everything... Remy, for God's sake... Stewart, we tried to be... Please. I'm sorry. Cars must leave the garage area after dropping off patients. Please keep moving. Hot coffee and food is available in... I'm talking with the people at the dam, Mayor Lewis. They're maintaining a constant inspection. I can't take any chances, Colonel. Dr. Stockle said we can expect aftershocks. And I just got a report from the Building and Safety Department. They say some structures may look perfectly sound but have been so weakened, that even a minor quake can bring them down. Evacuate the area immediately below the dam. MAN ON MEGAPHONE: This is a precautionary evacuation. We repeat, there is no present danger of the dam collapsing. Move to high ground, west of Highland Avenue and north of Franklin. This is a precautionary evacuation. (ALL CLAMORING) I repeat, this is a precautionary evacuation. Wait! Wait! They're not lying to you. You've got plenty of time. Stay there. Stay there. Come on, lay down. You're gonna be all right. You're gonna be all right. Halt. Hey, Sid. How come you took this bunch prisoners? Suspicion of looting. Hey, how about turning that dark-haired girl over to me? She's a friend. Yeah. Sure. Hey, you. Come here. Yeah. Come on. Can I go home now? Can't allow that. You're my responsibility. But... Come on. It's a couple dozen blocks back to your house, and now that it's getting dark, the animals are loose. But... You just make yourself comfortable inside the store here, I have to send out patrols. You all patrol that area up there and watch out for looters. Move out! HANK: Hey, Sarge, look what we found. Jody! For Christ's sake, what a break! HANK: Caught these guys around the corner. Their car broke down. Look at the goodies they had with them. You think we ought to shoot 'em? Jody, we've just been putting you on. You can't kill guys for that. Maybe they didn't steal these necklaces and things. Maybe they're just fags who like to dress up in women's jewels. You find any dresses in the car? (CHUCKLES) No, Jody. Well, I guess we'll have to shoot 'em. Hey, wait a minute, Jody. I was telling these guys just today to lay off. I swear to God, I was. Ask 'em. Yeah. Ask 'em. Sure, those naked guys on the wall, that didn't mean nothing. We knew that you lifted weights and all that crap. Scum like you think you can get away with anything. Push people around when you want to. Steal when you want to. Make fun of men who have to work for a living, huh? But not today. Hey, come back, you guys. I was only kidding. Hey... Hey, don't do that, man. (ALL GROANING) (SCREAMS) Not like back in the store, is it, Miss Amici? No scrawny bitches coming in asking for double Green Stamps two days after the special's over, huh? None of that stuff. Move it! I want this whole patrol area quarantined. No civilians are to be allowed through without being questioned. Can't tell. They might be looters. What about the people trying to get through to Wilson Plaza aid station? I meant everybody. There's no other clear streets around here. Move out! Denise! Denise! (CAR APPROACHING) All right. out. What are you talking about? You're healthy enough to walk. I got a lot of injured to move and I mean, fast. That dam up there is liable to go at any minute. I've got some people I've got to find. This thing looks like it'll go anywhere and that's just what I need. Now, get out. Just a minute. You're one of those trouble makers, aren't you? I've never shot a trouble maker before, or are you gonna get out? Look. I'm looking for a girl and a little boy. They mean a lot to me. Send your butler. Where's the shift? All of them. Depends on what you want to do. That's a customized transmission. It's got eight forward speeds, and three reverse. All of them a hell of a lot harder to operate than that .38. All right, you're an ambulance driver. What? I'm sorry. It's been a hell of a day. Okay, that's it. We got one more. (DOG BARKING) (DOG WHIMPERING) We are in desperate need of blood type AB negative. Check Red Cross blood bank, and report back. Officer Scott. OFFICER ON MEGAPHONE: Coffee and food is available in basement shopping levels two and three. SAL: I never thought we'd get here. Careful. A long time to go a couple of lousy miles. Listen, lady, I gotta go now. I gotta move the truck out. I'll see you. Thank you very much. He's had a bad fall, he's hit his head and he just won't come to. Can I go with him? No, no. We'll get in touch with you. On the third level. Thank you. Right around there. MAN: Coming through.

Stewart Graff, is he all right? Yeah, he's all right, the last I saw, but Mr. Royce had a heart attack. He's had a heart attack? I'm just waiting word from the doctor. Listen, I've got to get out of here, I'm going up for some air. Will you come with me? No. I'd rather stay here. I'll see you later. Take care. (CHILDREN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (GUITAR PLAYING SOFTLY) (PEOPLE LAUGHING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) He's gone. He never had a chance. Should I tell his daughter? I don't want any deaths reported to the survivors until things settle down. JODY: Miss Amici. Miss Amici? You better eat. This is nice and fresh. Hank got into the deli down the street. A lot of guys with hair over regulation length wear 'em. Oh. You know, I really used to look forward to seeing you in the supermarket. You never complained like all the rest of those women... Carrying on. Thank you. And I hope the lousy store was knocked flat. What I really want to do is open a karate school. I'll have enough saved pretty soon. A lot of money in karate, you know. I'll give you free lessons. I'm not really very hungry. It's a hot night out. Why don't you take off that jacket? You always liked me, too. I could tell. You never said anything, but I could tell. (WHIMPERS) (STUTTERS) Don't... Don't hurry me. It's no real fun that way. (BOTH CHUCKLE) ASSISTANT: Everything all right? Yeah, fine. (LOUD RUMBLING) Another one of those damned earth slides on the other side of the reservoir? Uh-huh. Jesus! That's a scary sound. How is he? Oh, he's going to be all right. Mild shock and a concussion. I've given him something to help him sleep. Where are you taking him now? Well, the Army Medics have set up their field x-ray trucks in the third level garage. Doctor! Doctor! Why aren't you with my father? (STUTTERS) Don't bother me now. (RUMBLING) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (ALL CLAMORING) Get down! Get down! ANNOUNCER ON RADIO: Red Cross emergency aid stations are already functioning... (WHIMPERS) Are you sure you know the way to Wilson Plaza? Damn it. That's where I just came from. ANNOUNCER: The Mayor's office has not yet released a damage report on the aftershock. However, details are expected momentarily. Please stand by... (SCOFFS) There's other buildings sure to have come down. First time in my life I'm ashamed of my profession. We never should have put up those 40-story monstrosities. Not here. Hey! What's the matter? The door's out of line. It wasn't before that aftershock a few minutes ago. (RUMBLING) Don't be scared. We'll be feelin' those quivers for days, the C.O. said. That looks great. A pretty girl ought to have nice things. I've always thought so. Hey, you gotta forget about the way it used to be. Your brother could be dead. Nobody left but me to take care of you. Well, I've got another brother in San Francisco. And he's in the Mafia. HANK: There's another car coming, Jody. This area's quarantined. You'll have to detour. I'm a police officer. We're transporting injured people. This is an emergency. What isn't after an earthquake? Go back or take them to a Hare Krishna temple. Lew, help me. He's nuts! Crazy. What the hell are you doing? I know this kid. (GUN COCKING) She's under detention. Looting. Take it easy. All right. Okay. Go back the way you came. Okay. JODY: Move out! ROSA: Don't leave me with him! Lew! Lew! Help me! Lew, help me! Lew! I'm going for an officer. That guy in there is cracked. Come on. Hey, come on. Pull up another hundred feet. Pull it around the corner and stop. Nuts, am I, huh? (WHIMPERS) You got your nerve. Only a whore would wear something like that. (SCREAMS) SLADE: Rosa! Let's go. Better not. (SCREAMS) (CRYING) Come on, Rosa. Come on. Settle down, will you, huh? Earthquakes bring out the worst in some guys, that's all. Here. Come on. Here, look. Look what you got. Look at what you got to take care of. ANNOUNCER ON RADIO: ---caused by a ruptured gas main. (LAUGHING) Total evacuation is under way. My brother told me you were a strange kind of cop. ...dozens of weakened structures collapsed when the aftershock hit. The worst disaster was the four-year-old, supposedly earthquake-proof, Wilson Plaza. The Army Corps of Engineers is rushing all available workers and equipment to the scene. Stand by for further bulletins. (WATER TRICKLING) Oh, my God. Inspector! Inspector! (CAR HONKING) Hold it. Stop. You can't go any farther. SLADE: I'm a police officer, transporting injured people. Okay. Come on. I'm sorry, lady, now you can't go... Officer. I've got to get to... Stay back. No, it's urgent. Listen. Listen. Mr. Graff, they're still down there. Remy and Mr. Royce. Denise, too. She asked for you. Where were they in the building? The third level below. Come on. COLONEL: I agree. There's a chance people could still be alive in the sub-basements. It'll take days to unearth all this debris. Look, the air supply can't last more than a few hours. I know the design of this building. I've been through it a hundred times. The basement extends clear out to the street on this side. If the storm drain runs down deep enough, all you'd have to tunnel through is a couple of layers of concrete and a few feet of dirt. I got radio word a few minutes ago, that the Hollywood reservoir dam is disintegrating. We're on high ground here, but those drains are 40 feet down. Believe me, if the dam goes, they'll fill up in minutes. Dams have lasted for weeks with major breeches in them. It's too dangerous to try. Besides, the sewers must've cracked around like whips. You know, the eastern approach is totally blocked. Yeah, well, what about the other end? Well, I was just gonna call up an inspection team. Come and see for yourself. Let's go. COLONEL: Make way, fellas. Lew, where are you going? I'm going with them. Let's have a look. Can't you get through here? We don't know how far this opening runs. You haven't checked? FOREMAN: My men stay here. That could cave in any second! Hey, you know as well as I do, the chances are a hundred to one, that everybody in that building is dead. (RUSTLING) Holy mother! I got through. (BREATH ES HEAVILY) Can you get me a jackhammer and a bolt cutter? You use a jackhammer in there, the roof'll fall in. Look. I think there's some people alive in there, and I'm gonna try and get 'em out. Well, nobody else is. And you can't do it all alone. Yeah, I won't be alone. He's coming with me. Make sure they don't turn on the compressor for this hammer until we signal. Right. Any word from the dam? The last radio report we had, said no further cracks had appeared. Swell. Hey, you sure I can't talk you out of this insanity? (SCOFFS) Colonel, I really wish you could. Good luck. Watch your head. GRAFF: Keep it coming! I've paced it off. We ought to break through right about the third basement level. This thing ready? SLADE: All right. The pressure's ready. Hold on. MAN: I'm getting outta here. ASSISTANT: Inspector! Inspector! Get the hell outta here! It's breaking up. Get out! (ALL CLAMORING) Get out. It's breaking up! Get out! Should be a couple of feet of earth then just the basement wall. Hand me that light. (WOMEN CRYING) (DRILLING) We're through! MAN 1: Oh, my God! MAN 2: They're through! We're saved! (DRILLING CONTINUES) Anybody in there? VANCE: About 70 of us. (HORN HONKING) Got it. Stewart. Come on, let's go. Be careful of the loose area down there. Easy. Easy. Easy. Careful of the loose stuff down there. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (RUMBLING) WOMAN: No, not again. It stopped. It stopped. Take it easy and watch your head down below. I got you.l got you. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) Take your time and watch it down there. That stuff is all loose. MAN 1: Give us a hand down here. MAN 2: Straight up. Straight up. (SCREAMING) SLADE: Nice and easy. Okay. That's all of them. Let's go. Yeah. MAN: Watch it. Don't panic now. (RUSTLING) GRAFF: Women first! Come on, come on, come on, come on. Relax. There's lots of time. SLADE: Take it easy. Take it easy. GRAFF: Take it easy. One at a time. Women first. Take it easy. Take it easy. Don't panic. (WATER RUSHING) Go on, Remy. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (SCREAMS) Remy! Lew! Lew! This used to be a hell of a town, Officer. Yeah.
