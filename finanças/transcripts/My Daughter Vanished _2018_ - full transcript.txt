Does that provide the most anguish? - All right, the fliers are done. We should probably get going. - You remember my brother Steve? - Yes. Hello. - We're very fortunate that he's here to help. - I know what you are going through because when Scotty ran away after Owen died, I didn't sleep. We eventually found him.
