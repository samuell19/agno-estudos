AND THE VIOLIN STOPPED PLAYING Gypsies! Stop playing those pseudo tunes! You can fool everyone but me, gypsies. Play gypsy or don't play at all! Excuse me sir! - Play as the officer wishes! - Of course! Play Gypsies! This is it! It's real gypsy music. Look at... Brahms, Liszt. I know this music. He won't fool me. Way to go! Here you go, have a drink. Come to my city. You will come? I'll get you a lot of shows. My family owns almost all of Günzburg. Our last name is Mengele. Agricultural machinery. "Karl Mengele and Son". I listened to Gypsies in Germany, but none played like you. - Play something gypsy. - Thank you, sir. Screenplay: Aleksander Ramati based on his own novel. Produced and directed by Alexander Ramati -... we'll buy clothes for the holidays. - And a watch for Roman. Historical events and characters are real and based on facts Warsaw 23rd of November 1942 Mara, why are you awake? Danko... Danko Müller! - I escaped from the ghetto. - From the ghetto? What were you doing in the ghetto? "Z" is for Gypsies and "J" is for Jews. Now they treat us like Jews. Five thousand Gypsies were sent from Łódź to Chełmno. To a concentration camp. I escaped from Lodz and found myself in Warsaw. I need to sleep. I'll get up early tomorrow. All ten who escaped will meet in the forest in Anin. - I will go with you? - No. We will join the partisans. It's not for you. You have a family, women... I also have my parents, Wali's parents, relatives... You left them a year ago. I didn't do that. Not in my heart. I wanted to give my children something I never had. Education... Better life... Tomorrow we will return to our site. We'll gather everyone and leave for Hungary. - There are no Germans there. - Are our passes valid? Yes, by the end of the year. But only for the return to Brest. How are the Germans behaving here? Do they give gypsies any trouble? No, only Jews. But there are no Jews in Brest any more. What about those 40,000 in the ghetto? There is no ghetto any more. JEWS ARE PROHIBITED TO WALK ON THIS SIDE OF THE STREET. Don't worry. You're not a Jew. Rosa, Dimitri has arrived. Mara... but you've grown. I'm going to see my parents. - You came to celebrate. - Celebrate what? Fiftieth birthday of our leader "Szero Roma". Unfortunately, Dad, we're not here to celebrate. We have to gather everyone and get them out of Poland. In Warsaw, Gypsies began to be sent to concentration camps. Just like they did with the Jews. - They won't do that to us. Our women walk around the city every day. Daughters dance for rich Germans. And the young people work for a German in a factory. Listen dad! Please listen to me. Danko, our cousin just escaped from the ghetto and told what he had seen. They're sending Gypsies to their deaths! German officers are invited here today. They are not a threat to us. - Roman! - Paweł! Feel like home. Welcome. May you and your horses live long... ...my friend. Colonel Krüger. Thank you for coming! No thank you! Please! Food! It's a forest bird. They are delicious. Now they are the tastiest, because they put on weight for the winter. Please help yourself. However, thank you. Our stomachs are not adapted. - Who is this? - It's Zoja. Zoja Natkin. - I saw her a year ago. - She was 13 then... ...now she's a woman. You should send us a group of dancers and musicians sometime to perform for our troops. Now, I'd like to say a few words. Ladies and gentlemen... This winter will be very cold. On behalf of the German authorities, I would like to offer hospitality. Put all the gypsies in beautiful, warm homes. With hot and cold water... With bathrooms... With toilets inside the houses, not outside. - It's all for you. - And where, Colonel? In Brest, in houses left by Jews. Sorry, Colonel! - And where are the Jews now? - They've been moved. "Kelderari" will attest. Yes, Dombrowski? Yes, Colonel. Thank you. We'll be moving there soon. Let's get one thing clear... Jews... are an inferior race. They have been a problem for Christian culture for centuries. You are "Aryans" like us. We will treat you as Poles. Do you accept our offer? I will give an answer tomorrow. First we must convene the Council, after which I will make a decision. Great! They want to put us in a ghetto... I'm sure they gather us there for so that it would be easier to load us onto trucks later... and sent to concentration camps. We have to flee to Hungary. There are no Germans there. It's nonsense. Gypsy ghetto is not a bad thing. It's just a job for the Germans. We help them win. That's why Colonel Krüger is my friend. Hello Tomasz. I was there. Soldiers guard the area, which is fenced with barbed wire. There is only one way out. The soldiers showed me some houses. There are no furnished apartments. Everything smells terrible. No one cleaned them up after they moved the Jews. Horrible smell as the toilets are inside not outside! Inside! And they have tubs... Who are these tubs for? We have a river. It won't be bad. The houses are warm. We'll clean them up. Why did the "Kelderari" accept the offer? They'll be moving in any day now. So let's wait and see... Wait and see what happens with "Kelderari"? We're talking about how to live here, not how to survive. I came here with my family, leaving good Warsaw, to warn you and save you. We can't wait, we must leave now. - Go away... Where will you go? To Hungary? - Yes! Maybe your violin knows the language, but we don't speak Hungarian. How will our people find work? How will our women predict the future? In Polish? The Germans are too smart to lock them all up at once. First Łódź, then Warsaw, and then other towns and villages. Sandu, you haven't said anything yet. And now, I won't talk either. We are discussing my son's proposal. It's not right for his father to speak out. I've talked to everyone, or... I've had a chance to talk. I listened to the advice. I will decide now. I am responsible for you and for all my people. So I decide we stay. Council meeting ended. Good morning. - Zoja! - Good morning! You danced wonderfully yesterday. Are you Roman Mirga from Warsaw? Yes. You've grown up a lot since our last meeting - Can you do that? - I don't know, I haven't tried. So try it. - Failed to. - Once again. - When are you coming back to Warsaw? - We're not coming back. - So you're staying permanently? - I think so. Wait for me. Roman Mirga! Stay away from my girlfriend. - I don't know what you mean. - I saw you yesterday... and now as you spoke. She's "promised" to me, you understand? By her father. We'll get married in the spring when she turns 15. I did not know. Well, now you know. Stay away from her. Gypsies! Dimitri... - Dimitri Mirga. - Count Paszkowski? Roman my son and my wife. Count Paszkowski! It seems like yesterday, when we raced down the road. You were always the better rider. I was better at riding bareback. Let's celebrate the holidays. Like the old times. Other times. Please come to my New Year's party. Only a couple of people. Like in the old days, when my father was still alive. - We will come with pleasure. - I'll send a sleigh for you. Kelderari! I won! Where's my reward? Alice! Where is my daughter? I hope she didn't fall out of the sleigh! And now... Polonaise! Were your predictions true? Of course not. I wanted it to be happy. That's what my grandma taught me. Look at the gypsies on the sleigh. I hope I never forget it... ever. - You are Dimitri Mirga. - Yes. Someone wants to see you urgently. He's waiting on the main road. - Pole? - Yes. I came here straight from the fortress as soon as I heard the news. To warn you. Tomorrow morning, the Germans will surround the camp and they will take your horses. You won't be able to travel. Or run away if need be. They will also take the horses of the gypsies living in the ghetto. You have the night advantage. You must hit the road immediately, even if it's too cold. Not a word to anyone. Remember! No one. Thanks Janusz. Thank you very much. Do you want to run away? I've got a good deal in town, and we're not running away. Calm down. Sit down. Here, have a drink. Mercy! Can't see warnings? First the horses, then us. - This is how it ends. - All right. Look, you scared us three months ago. And what happened? Nothing. What about your head? Don't talk to me like that. I know what's best for us. - Let's ask the Council. - I can ask. They can advise, but I decide. What you're saying is gossip. To prove it... I will go to my friend Colonel Krüger... and I will ask him personally. Don't you dare! If you do, they'll arrest us immediately! Look how scared you are. All right. Want to see if the Council will back me up? - Kora! - Yes, Dad. Tell the council the meeting is in an hour. I'll sleep for a while. Stubborn and stupid Gypsy! Roman. Go around the ghetto. And find some "Kelderari". Tell him to warn their leader, Dombrowski. Roman, don't you dare enter the ghetto. I will not enter. Hi! Come here. Hurry up! You ran away, didn't you? Accept reality Zofia. Show some compassion, mother. It's okay, you can leave. It's another gypsy. Paweł, what happened? - For God's sake, tell me! - They took all... - Germany. - When? They left an hour ago. When I saw them, I hid in the attic, and then I came here. Get rid of them both please! Come with me to the camp. We're leaving. Join us. - But I am the Kelderari. - You're a gypsy, right? Come on, we're not welcome here anyway. Run away from the city. Now you have the evidence, right? We must leave while we can. Regardless of whether "Szero Rom" agrees with it or not. The council must elect a new "Szero Roma". A man who can save us from death. The only one who foresaw this is Dymitr Mirga. You can't do this! The leader is chosen for life. In special circumstances, we can change our leader. Under special circumstances, the Council stops advising... and starts to decide. We will vote. Please raise your hand... who wants Dymitr Mirga to be the new "Szero Rom". Dimitri Mirga, you are now the new Szero Rom. This is no time for speeches. I am honoured... and I will do everything to help you. But now, everyone has to be there in an hour, ready to go Roman, drive into that thicket. Move up! We will stop here today. We will only travel after dark. - Praised be Jesus Christ. - Now and forever. - Are you coming back from the market? - No... I was visiting my sister in Rudki. - Do you know where it is? - No, I'm not from here. Have you seen Germans here? Yes! But there is more in Sobibór. Is it a small village? I've never heard of her. A little village? Big camp... Quadruple barbed wire fence and minefield all around. There are at least 100,000 Jews... and gypsies. - Gypsies? - You're right? - No. Just yesterday I saw trucks filled with them. - What's burning there? - People. Well, I have to go back. May God take care of you. Now and forever. We're going straight to the concentration camp. I saw a lot of smoke. A Polish farmer told me that they burn Jews and Gypsies there. I couldn't believe what he was saying. They probably took the "Kelderari" there. Don't tell anyone about it. Don't let them panic. Go to the people and say: "we're heading east". Good thing it's nearby. Tell them that... we know there, roads and forests. And that... there are many villages that are friendly to us. Go! We are in Ukraine. It's familiar territory. Look! What is this? Four gypsy wagons then passed by. Put it back on. Let others know too. We have to watch out for dogs. They can betray us. - Don't you need anything? - Thank you. We cope. Thank you. Mikita! Come with us, please. - You know the people there better. - No. You lead people. Let's see how you do with normal activities. This is not Warsaw, nor is it a nightclub to play the violin. Let's go! Get out of here! Get out! Hey Kola! Kola? We want to buy food. For God's sake! What is going on here? Go from here. You bring misfortune. - What are you talking about? - The Germans were here this morning. And the Ukrainian police. There were several families here. They took not only them, but also the hosts they stayed with. Run and hide! For your sake! - Where did the Germans go? - To Sławków. go now! God is not taking care of you. Someone from the village informed the Germans. They can come back any time. We must go to the forest immediately. This is our only chance. Find the others and tell them to come back immediately. You hear it? What? Lorries. They got in the way. Fire! Get off! Mum! God forgive us our sins... They're some animals. No, these are people, not animals! Ukrainians collaborating with the Germans. Put your hands up! It's not Germany. They're gypsies. Don't be afraid. We are partisans. - Where are you from? - From Brest. And with carts... and gypsy clothes? God Himself must protect you. It's a miracle you've made it this far. - Where are you going? - To Hungary. Where there are no Germans. Don't go any further if you want to survive. - Do you have food? - Not too much. - Enough for 1-2 weeks. - All right... By then the snow will melt and spring will come. Set up camp and wait out. If you stay here for two weeks, I'll protect you, but after that, you're on your own. Thank you very much. Get rid of gypsy clothes tarpaulins from carts... Split up the caravan and travel in small groups. A few cars. Pretend to be peasants going to the market or going home. Thank you. It worked! - Are all the cars there? - No. But they will arrive soon. I'm sure. Go to sleep, Dad. - Take me! - No. Don't you understand there's nothing else we can do? This is the only way we can change something. We will be forced to get married. Tradition says so. No... I don't want it that way. I told you to stay away from her. But you didn't listen. Now you will pay! - You won't survive! - I'm not afraid of you! You raven's son! And you... you're a whore! You think I haven't seen it? I saw everything! And you deserve the same! You must die! Are you crazy? You are risking everyone's life! He started first. Gypsies who try to fight each other with knives... - Is this what you want, Koro? - He's not a gypsy! It's a stranger. He is the son of Szero Rom. All right. Do it. Kill me! I'm still waiting for the cars... Zenon Gabrowski and Jan Michalak. Look, Hungary! There's a border up there in the mountains. Oh my God! Who are you? Poles, how are you? We're going to bury them. Gypsies or not, they're people, not dogs. We are like those. We want to bury them too. - Then come with us. You think those who didn't make it... Zenon, Jan and others... are dead? Father, give me your blessing to marry Zoja. Let me see, if only briefly, what life is all about. Well, this place seems safe to leave the carts... and marry a son. - As you wanted. - Zoja, we're getting married today. I expected. No one will surprise Natkin Bor. Do we have your permission, Bora Natkin? You have my permission "Szero Rom" and my blessing, because my daughter wants it. Give me your right hands. Are you Roman Mirga, are you taking this woman... married of your own free will? Yes. Do you Zoja Natkin take this man... for her husband, of her own free will? Yes. You are now husband and wife. Cursed! Rotting in Hell! I don't want that bitch! Never! Why didn't you kill that alien? Let this young man and woman be happy. "May they live happily ever after." Into tiny pieces! Enjoy life together for many, many years! Let's be friends forever? Of course. Our family jewels. My mother got them at her wedding. I promised you a watch for Christmas, my son. ...but it wasn't possible. Please accept this... It used to belong to my father. What I received from him, I now give you. Have it forever... Regardless, time will never stop" Husband. Come on everybody. When it's cloudy, we'll go. We'll meet on the other side of the border... in the Slovak town of Jasna. - We'll continue on foot. - And our horses? We won't leave them here? It is safest in the mountains. Away from the outposts. We will not cross with horses, even if we wanted to. - We'll be too visible. - Never! I will never leave my horses. This is my decision as Szero Roma. You are not my Szero Rom! You are not my Szero Rom! Too many people have died under your leadership. I'll pay you back in Hungary for everything you've done... Even the Germans didn't hurt us that much. We can escape with the horses. on foot, no. Why did I leave Brest? To keep the horses! To save life! You have lived well under my command. Look where it took us! Only misery, hunger and death! Who wants to hear it? Yes, some of our brothers died... But you... you're alive. Trust me. Trust me again and you will be safe. I see you all tomorrow. Understood? I see you all tomorrow, alive! Tomasz, Zdenko! Let's go! We will never leave our horses. Zdenko! Tomasz! Don't go. Not to the valley! Don't eat there! Don't follow him! There are Germans in the valley! I did everything I could. The rest is in God's hands. Give me a pipe. Run! Up! As soon as possible! Everyone down! My father is dead. They are all dead. We came across a horse patrol. They opened fire. And they killed everyone. We managed to hide. - Can I stay with you? - Of course you can. You are one of us. Take care of him. Paweł! Go upstairs and see what's going on. Roman! Take Roman and send him back with the message. I know this bridge. The Kelderari have passed through it many times. The left side is guarded by the Germans. On the other side are Hungarians. Go and tell your father. Fast fast! Move up! Paweł come back! - They're on the other side. - Yes... - Mum! - Mara! No... please! Go! - What are you doing? - I need to find Paweł. - Maybe he's still alive! - Roman! come back! Paweł, I came back for you. - Where are the Germans? - They left. - And your family? - She's safe. It's good to have a family. Paweł? Don't be afraid. We are gypsies too. - Who are you? - Polish Roma. - Let's talk business. - Yes? - What's the deal? - Horses... I sell horses. And you don't have horses. - And no carts. - You have nothing. You have to start life from scratch. Correct. We have nothing... And we have no money. But you have jewellery. Yes? Jewellery, we have... We will accept jewellery. And I'll give you a good price. Roman... Walk over people, let them give what they have. I'm waiting for it to warm up. One summer is better than seven winters... Life is beautiful in Hungary. Grandchild! I want a grandson! 19th of March 1944 We'll see what we can sell. It's time to trade. God! Hungary has invaded! Why are they still here and not in Auschwitz? Lord, why are you doing this? We're not doing anything wrong. We gave you a ride. Please. Mercy. We Christians. We are Aryans! - Where are we going? - I don't know. Where is Auschwitz? I heard they talk about Auschwitz! I don't know... Hand me the violin. - I left it in the car. - What are you saying? She says she left the doll in the car. We returned to Poland. Auschwitz 12 km We are approaching Auschwitz. This is the place that Nazi was talking about. Probably something like Sobibór. - No! No! - Mara! Hide in the bushes until the train leaves. - Is that what father says... Approach that woman and ask her to take you home. - Mum! - I'll come back for you. Move! Faster! - Where are you taking us? - You're going to the gypsy camp. Gypsy camp... is a family camp. - You'll love it. - What will happen to us? What do you mean? Nothing. You're not a Jew. You are "Aryans". Just like us. But this is a concentration camp! You will work. 15672. - Number? - 12546. - Number? - 1235... I know you. From the Old Town. Yes of course, Warsaw. You made me play Brahms and Liszt... Are you a doctor... from Bavaria? Way to go. Dr Josef Mengele. - Are you still playing? - Yes. You will play in a gypsy orchestra. - In the orchestra? - Of course. What's a gypsy camp without an orchestra? This is my wife... my son... Do you remember? They played with me in Warsaw. We only need a violinist. Women can go to the kitchen. And young... He seems healthy and strong. My son graduated from high school in Warsaw. He speaks fluent German. "Translator"? Useful as a "translator". Translator! - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. - Sorry. - What? For my hair. My God. I love you. I love you, not your looks. Hair is not important. they will grow back. They were cut for hygiene reasons. How long will it take for my hair to grow back? It's only a couple of months. Please... Don't cry... You're beautiful. What is your name? Ask the children what their names are. Where and when were they born... and what tribe they belong to. And add, light brown eyes. - Light brown, not brown. - Yes, doctor. Injections, like the other twins. - Doctor! - Yes, doctor. - Do you give vitamins? - Yes, doctor. All right. I am very interested in gangrene of the cheek. Maybe I will describe it in a scientific paper. I want everyone here... well taken care of. Of course, doctor. I'm doing the best I can. Has any one recovered? - So far, no. KINDERGARTEN 20th of April 1944, Hitler's birthday I brought you candy. Dance, children. Dance! Are you okay here? - Mum... - Do you remember... Green meadows... Cows and sheep... Live! They are very undisciplined but brave. I saw them on the Russian front. Roman, you have to run. You and Zoja. Why? We've been here three months now and not a single Gypsy has been taken to the gas chamber. No, you can take it My baby is not sick! - It's my baby. - He's very sick. You have to let him take it. We are Aryans. We're not going to gas. They'll let us die of natural causes... Typhus, dysentery, tuberculosis, noma. And only those who survive... they will be gassed. Do you think that by killing all the Jews they will leave witnesses? He is an artist. Play, gypsies! Play for Commander Höss. Brahms, Liszt, Bartok. We have just returned to Auschwitz. Please... Remember, professor... You have everything you need for your patients, and I get documents. Every month. Yes. It was an offer to "extend" my life. Yes extensions. Not saving lives, just prolonging. Finally, the scientific report will be published with his name as usual. It will keep him away from the front and justify his presence here as a scientist. It is not necessary. I don't need a doctor... Tell me my time has come. Sand... I remember when we got married at a Polish priest... in the largest church in Brest. It was the happiest day of my life. It was as if you were born Polish. - Where is Zoja? - She is sick. - What is this? typhus? Tuberculosis? - I don't know! Zoja! Roman! - Is this your sister, wife? - My wife. With proper medication and nutrition, some of my patients recover. Don't worry. I will do anything to save her. I can promise you that, young man. They're almost blue! I want those eyes in test tubes. Phenol, benzoic acid? Acid. Very interesting. Don't worry about your wife. He will defeat the disease. He'll recover, you'll see. Thank you. You can leave. I'm busy. Obersturmbannführer Eichmann will come from Budapest to see the gypsy camp. I have to prepare. She doesn't want to eat, she has lost the will to live. There's nothing we can do about it. Maybe you'll try. It's me... Roman. Yes... All right. I am Szero Rom... But Szero Rom without the Council, because they do not exist. Because you are my son, one day you will be the next Szero Roma. - You need to get out of here. You have to! - No. I can't leave Zoja in the hospital. But even if I wanted to run away... ...tell me how? You will find a way. And then... tell the world. I'm sure, that... even if the world knows the truth, it will try to forget. You must live... to resemble her. Please... Please, son! Please! You promised... You promised you would do anything to save her! God! This is what came from Heinrich Himmler. Sister! I want to see them in ten days. I expected a lot from Eichmann's visit. But I didn't expect it so soon. We have to put the Jews of Hungary somewhere. Our capacity of 9 thousand, daily. It's far too little. Tell me... Why are you so interested in twins? I've vivisectioned six pairs of twins. Almost the same age as the two you saw... I found... that the thymus gland... gland, important in human development, normally gradually disappears... and disappears after puberty... In twins, and only in them it grows! It's getting bigger. What are the benefits of this discovery? If we know what differences there will be between twins... and we'll learn how to recreate them... we will be able to improve the human species. And believe me! My experience shows... that we can lighten the hair... change brown eyes to blue. Changes occur twice as fast in the Aryan races, which distinguishes them from the lower races. Twice as fast! I'm impressed, doctor. Unfortunately... I won't be able to finish my experiments. This Eichmann... keeps rushing. Place... It's a matter of place. 1st of August 1944 It's my mother. My sister. All right. On the lorry. Don't kill me! As you can see, I don't need a translator any more. You will go to the construction crew. Guardian! Take this Gypsy to the first barracks. Father... This is no longer a romantic gypsy camp. Pity. I miss that romantic atmosphere. Since you are my son, one day you will become Szero Roma. Kora... I'm going to run away. - Are you running away with me? - Where? To the farm where my sister stayed. Maybe we can find shelter there. When do you want to do that? Tomorrow. After a break. Work! Now! Stand! Take them. Stop. Stop. Kora! Take the gun. Mrs. Stefo. Mrs. Stefo. Mara! Mara, it's me... Roman. This is my brother. And mum and dad? Go home quickly. Half a million Gypsies disappeared during the war or were executed in concentration camps. No compensation was paid to them. Documentation of the events was classified by the Germans and they remain unknown. This film is not only a tribute to the courageous fight for the survival of the gypsies, but also a call to end the discrimination that still persists 40 years after the Holocaust.
