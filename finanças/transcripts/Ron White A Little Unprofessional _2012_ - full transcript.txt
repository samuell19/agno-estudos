[bluesy instrumental music] I told you to shut up. [instrumental music] [car horn blowing] Hey baby! What the hell are you doing? What?! Ron you promised. You know how I get when all that jabbering starts. Hell that just makes me crazy sometimes. You know how I am. Get in. You have a show to do in four hours. Oh baby we're going to make it to that show. You don't worry about that. You just get this Cadillac fired up and headed towards Austin. Jabbering. [instrumental music] [applause] Alright! Bye baby! [applause] Austin TX, how the hell are ya? It's great to be back. It is so great to be back in Austin TX, man I just have so much fun whenever I am here. I see so many friends, thanks for coming out. I was in Bakersfield, California Wednesday night, boy you people think you people are stupid. [laughter] The last time I was Austin was the first time I was ever blatantly been offered a 3 way and I turned it down because it was one of those deals where it was two dudes and me. I don't even watch 2 1/2 men. We flew in for Los Angeles and we were at LAX going through screening and this guy is just losing his fucking mind because I guess he doesn't travel that much and he just isn't used to this equipment and he is just going crazy. You know you can have fun with that, you can do what I do.. I take two Viagra and demand a pat down. [laughter] What's that in your pants Mr. White? I have no idea. [laughter] You are going to need to pat that down. Pat it back up again. Give it a couple twists, see if it's hooked to anything. You might want to go wash your hands. I started this tour this summer in Las Vegas and while I was in Vegas I broke this tooth... off at the gum line in an alcohol swimming pool related incident. [laughter] I had a show to do in 4 hours, I was drunk and missing a tooth. It looked a little unprofessional, not to me but to the fine folks at the Mirage it god damn sure did. I told them you've got to get a dentist to patch this up, I will not go on stage looking like this because this tooth doesn't look that big until it is gone. They found an all night dental school; this dentist is 14 years old. He hooks up to the gas and I don't feel anything, I am like dude you need to turn this gas up. He says “the are regulations of the state of Nevada stating which code one section four” fuck and I asked him, I said where did you go to college? He goes, Brigham Young, I am like fuck dude turn it up to Catholic. [laughter] Never let a Mormon set your buzz level. Never, don't do it. And I'll tell you why, they don't understand fucked up the way you and I do. They don't they are guessing and they're shitty guessers. When he got through with the procedure, you could still tell which tooth he had worked on because it was a different color. My teeth looked like Indian corn. I had to go to my dentist who is pitching veneers for my teeth because he says I am doing wide screen, high definition television, which is nobody's friend. Man every actor I know in Hollywood would rather have low definition narrow screen TV's so they look thin and fuzzy instead of clearly fat. [laughter] I would like to see my dick on a widescreen tv. That way I can quit looking at through my reading glasses. [laughter] Put these on baby. [laughter] It looks bigger than it feels. I had no idea how expensive veneers were man. They wanted to do 8 teeth on the top and 6 teeth on the bottom. And I was like well how much does that cost and he said $27,500. Fuck, how much is dental school, I'll teach my mother how to do it. You are going back to college mom, I never went to college, well this will be fun for you then was a weird week and I knew it was going to be a weird week because it started off weird. I was going to go Vegas a day early to do some media and I wanted to see this show called love that's also at the Mirage Beatles Cirque du Soleil show fantastic fucking show. So I was talking to my wife, my wife and I live in Atlanta and Hollywood and we were out in California I said I am leaving today at 3:30 to go to Las Vegas and I have airplane that you guys bought me. I like it a lot. Half the fortune 500 companies in America have let go of their private jets, not Ron White, Inc. I am flying that son of a bitch straight into bankruptcy. [laughter] I guarantee you, one day I will be living in a double wide trailer with shag carpet and I'll have a jet with weeds growing through it. I will be in the front seat going push me around some. And I don't come from money, I come from the opposite of money, I come from no money. [laughter] Ten years ago I lived in a camper in my friend's back yard, he didn't even know I was there. It wasn't even a nice camper it was like a homemade pop up camper, it looked like someone had duct taped a tent to a golf cart. I had a twenty-inch Coleman television. I had to pump it up during commercials. You couldn't watch porn on it because nobody's that coordinated. [laughter] I was broke. I owed the IRS a bunch of money because I don't understand how that works, it's confusing. When I started doing stand up, they said that made me an independent contractor and I needed to start filing my taxes quarterly, which I thought meant every 25 years. [laughter] My brain won't wrap itself around shit that complicated man my brain does this, that's it that's all it does. I have ADD, I have a learning disability I don't have a high school diploma. I am smart but you can't prove it on paper. [laughter] I do have a GED and you don't know what GED stands for then you probably got one too. [laughter] Anyway I told my wife I said that I am leaving today at 3:30 to go to Vegas and my wife is singer/songwriter composer Margot Rey is her name, a brilliantly talented woman and she says well I am working with a guitar player in the studio until 5:00, you can't wait until 5:30 so I can fly with you and I say can you be there at 5:30 and she said yes, which I knew was a lie because she is the biggest liar I have ever met in my life. When it comes to how long it is going to take her to get somewhere, I hear her on the phone all the time just lying through her teeth, "we are two exits away, traffic is really heavy, we should be there in 15 minutes.” I am like you are the fucking bathtub. [laughter] We wouldn't be there in 15 minutes if we were where you said we were. But I told her, if you get there at 5:30 then you can fly with me but let me tell you something sugar tits at 5:31 I am wheels up and I fucking gone. I said that, [laughter] Not very loud, [laughter] But I said it. 5:31 gets there, is she there no, do I leave? No. [laughter] 6:01 gets there is she there, no, do I leave no. Why? Because this dick won't suck itself that's why, [laughter] It won't I have asked it to many, many times. If fact the other day, I sat my dick down I looked him straight in the eye and I said listen. I know I have drug you into some pretty muddy shit in the last 35 years but I need you to get past that, learn how to suck yourself so I can grow a spine and get on with my god damn life. It went in one ear and out the other. My dick has ears, it has an eye and it has two ears and a double chin, Mr. Potato dick. The cutest thing you have ever saw. I have little outfits I put on him. One of them's a raincoat. Not a condom, a raincoat. A little yellow slicker with that hat looks like that fish and chips dude. It is the exact same size as the one on the box. That's just an interesting fact. What is it Ron, an interesting fact. So we go see love and Beatles Cirque du Soleil show, huge fan of the Beatles. I just love their music, always have and the Cirque is always fun and our shows are always at the same time so I have never been able to see I I got 8 people from my camp, my wife sitting next to me. We have great seats because I work for the Mirage. Everything is perfect except, right behind me these two chicks are just jabbering, not about the show just jabbering jabber jabber can't shut up jabber jabber won't shut up jabber fucking jabber fucking jabber. The kind of chicks that could talk around a blow job. Mumble mumble I told him the other day... If I come home one more time and that baby has a shitty diaper wrapped around his ass I am gonna... Mumble mumble! I'm going to go get a dress to wear to Arbys... And I turned around and looked and I noticed their husbands weren't with them, I figured they were at a gunshow trying to find a way out of this fucking thing. [laughter] Oh that's way better. Then I hear a guy next to them say hey can you keep it down my family is trying to watch the show and she goes fuck you, we paid our money we will do whatever the hell we want. I am just steaming fucking pissed they are ruining my god damn night I can't hear anything but that, I have been waiting a year to see this fucking show. So I turn around and very politely, [laughter] Don't start with me, very politely I say lady talking during a live theatre as far as social skills goes is like shitting in the street. She said you better mind your own business, I said you better quit shitting in the street. [laughter] She said I'll have thrown out of here, I said if you don't quit flapping your fucking cockholster. [laughter] Everybody heard that before it was a little disturbance right behind me after very few people were privy to that one then 1700 people hear me go, if you don't quit flapping your fucking cockholster. [laughter] This is all at a show called love by the way. [laughter] I had her murdered and buried in the desert. It's Vegas baby, careful who you fuck with. And legend has it if you go out into the desert and the moon is full and the wind dies down you can still hear her jabbering. [laughter] I am a street shitter, I am shitting in the street. Did you what the fuck was that, that is that chick Ron killed. They call this jabber gulch. My favorite thing about playing Vegas is I get to play this golf course called Shadow Creek which is one if the most exclusive golf courses in the world. I worked for them for 3 years and didn't even know it existed. Because they knew if I found out it existed, I'd pester the fuck out of them until they put it in my contract. Which is exactly what happened. It is amazing, this golf course is so fucking tricked out. The first time I walked through the gates, I was like nobody is stopping me... It is where all the pros play when they're in Vegas and I was out there this summer and Tiger Woods was out there, just dicking around. [laughter] I made him sign my golf clubs I mean he is the most famous person I have ever met and I know a lot of famous people but nobody as famous as Tiger fucking Woods. I love Tiger man, I defended tiger when all that stuff first came out. When I heard those initial rumors I felt sick to my god damn stomach for the guy because I have never been accused of doing anything I didn't do. [laughter] Not one god damn time, I did it every single time. Not once could I go no that was Glen Campbell. [laughter] Hey a lot of things smell like strippers. And I defended him to my wife. I said you don't know what that guy has been through. He hit his first famous golf shot on tv when he was 2 years old, you don't what his home life is like, you can't judge a guy because he made one mistake. Then he gets caught with number 13, 14, 15,16, and 17. I start going god damn Tiger, come on buddy. And it got to the point where every time he got caught with another woman, my wife would go like this. [laughter] what? I don't even know the fucking guy, you act like I was holding his dick the whole time. We watched him make that long apology on television and afterwards my wife goes "do you think a guy like Tiger can quit cheating on his wife?" And I said... [laughs] [laughter] You bet. [laughter] Which you know is bullshit because you know just as well as I do, if a guy likes strange getting him to quit liking strange is like getting a dog who likes to kill chickens to quit killing chickens. They don't even know what you are talking about. You gotta quit killing chickens alright let me see if I got this straight, I can still kill chickens. [laughter] No you can't kill chickens anymore. Alright, lets say I am a hotel room with a chicken. Let's say the chicken just wants to touch me, [laughter] Can I kill that chicken? No. My wife told me all women want the same thing, they want to marry someone who will never have sex with anyone else no matter what. I said well maybe you should consider marrying somebody that nobody else wants to fuck. [laughter] If it means that much to you. Don't marry the most famous golfer in the world. Marry the most famous frisbee golfer in the world. Ain't no line to fuck that dude. We had a chat about cheating that day. My wife told me, she goes listen Ron lets get this straight, sex is sex period. I said no now oral sex is not the same as intercourse, she said it is the exact same. I said it's not the same price. [laughter] I heard that on the radio. It all comes down to opportunity some guys are put into a position where they have to say no to beautiful women and that is hard to do and some guys are never put in the position and that is way fucking easier. [laughter] I see these big 350 pound guys saying I have never cheated on my wife and I was like, I bet that was tough. [laughter] Tiger doesn't get any credit for all the pussy he turned down and that is the number you are looking for right there. My wife's best friend, her husband cheated on her and my wife hates Tiger's guts and I said well what about that guy? You don't hate that guy. She goes, he did it one time. I said he had one chance. This guy had sex with 100% of the women he possibly could his entire god damn life Tiger was 18 for 82,000 that takes a little god damn discipline right there. [laughter] If 82,000 women want to have sex with you and you only fuck 18 of them, that's love. [laughter] He was in love with that woman. She broke his tiny Tiger heart. He lost all those sponsors which never made sense to me because his core fan base is men and I don't know one guy in America who gave a fiddlers fuck what he did. I guarantee you not one guy in America went, really Tiger got some strange pussy, I am dropping AT&T. [laughter] Not one guy gave a fiddlers fuck. [laughter] Now when they were around their wives they acted like they gave a fiddlers fuck and get all foghorn leghorn, why I never I can't believe, a man would commit such transgressions towards his wife, I say I say how's his relationship with the Lord I'd like to know. Then as soon as they are around their buddies they are like, I wonder what kind of cologne he wears, [laughter] They want to smell just like that dude man. He lost some many sponsors I am thinking about bringing him over to Ron White Inc not because we need a new face for the company, I'd just love to have someone around the house to fade the heat when I fuck up. [laughter] Ron White you are the most selfish prick I have ever met in my life, Tiger get in here, [laughter] You tell her what you did. Ron White you are the finest man I have ever known, I shall fall to my bended knee and suckle your penis. [laughter] Well thank you baby. Slow down, watch out for those ears. [laughter] My new years resolution this year was to lose some weight and try and get in better shape and I was working out yesterday and I hurt my fat. [laughter] I sprained my fat roll. [laughter] Everybody in my camp is on my ass about taking better care of myself and I am like what? My wife bought me bicycle thinking I may ride it, it's for sale. It's a good deal too, it's like new. It's got 750 yards on it. [laughter] My wife wants me to start doing yoga with her and I said look baby I am not that flexible she goes you can bend over and touch your toes can't you and I said the only way I can touch my toes if someone cuts them off and hands them to me. [laughter] I can't even stand on one foot unless someone is shining a flashlight in my eye. [laughter] I thought this was funny, we were at my wife's yoga school the other day they have a vegan restaurant there and my wife goes why don't we eat here we never eat here. I said fine lets eat here because this dick won't suck itself. It's all about compromise folks. I take my tray around to all the bean sprout piles and I get to the cash register and my tray is empty. The purple dread lock kid at the cash register goes Mr. White aren't you going to have something for lunch? There's just nothing here that I eat. He picks up a piece of carrot cake that is wrapped in cellophane and says try this, it's vegetarian. The carrot cake is vegetarian? Yeah. So you mean to tell me there's no ham in this, [laughter] Because my mother makes a meat lovers carrot cake that has sausage, pepperoni, hamburger meat. Not really heart healthy she serves it with a Lipator and a stint. [laughter] They have Snuggies now for dogs and I love dogs but if I ever see a dog wearing a Snuggie I am going to kill it because that's what I think the dog would want me to do. [laughter] I think if all dogs go to heaven, Michael Vick is going to be a little nervous if he makes the cut. [laughter] There is going to be an awkward pause at the pearly gates. Really they are all here? Yeah seems like they're waiting on you Mike. I am going slip off to hell, tell Bin Laden I said fuck you. We got Bin Laden man, it took 10 years. It wasn't exactly a calf rope. He was in that house for 6 years with 5 wives, I would have shot my fucking self. [laughter] I would have had my head out the window screaming at drones, "I am over here. [laughter] Women - we have a little french bulldog named Pearl. The other day my wife said I finally figured it out, that dog is jealous of me. That dog loves you so much she can't stand it if I am in the same room with you. I said don't be ridiculous and when she walked into the kitchen, Pearl jumped on my stomach and said I can have all your babies at the same time. [laughter] She's coming back act like nothing is going on, nothing is going on. I didn't know whether to buy more of that weed or to never smoke it again. [laughter] I went with A. [laughter] I got busted with weed in Florida last year. Less than a gram of weed and they took my happy ass to jail. I have been partying in Florida for years, I didn't even know they had laws. Look to me like everyone just run amuck down there. And I will run amuck with ya, I will run the fuck out of amuck with ya. [laughter] They took me to jail man and I tell ya what happened I fired these two pilots for being dickheads. They were such dickheads they started following my plane around on this software called flight aware and if you know the tail number you can follow any plane in the world anywhere it goes. And before I would get to a town they would call the cops and tell them it was a drug plane so the cops would come fuck with me. That is pretty fucking funny. Then they were on the news in Atlanta, where I live, both of these assholes live on the news going Ron White is out of control. He gets drunk on his plane, he smokes pot on his plane, he has sex on his plane. And I am like, this is my plane we are talking about right? [laughter] It is not like I did that shit on a Delta flight for fuck sake. [laughter] No my phone is off. [laughter] My wife got pissed at me when I got busted with that weed and she smokes pot. What the fuck is up with that? I come home she goes you smoke too much pot. I said oh let me get this straight. You smoke the correct amount of pot. [laughter] You ever smoked so much pot your wife starts to make sense... Me either. [laughter] I have this reoccurring dream that my wife gets run over by a bus. Does that make me a bad person? I'm driving the bus. Burrrrr! Eeeerrrrr! Ahahhhh, blup, blup, blup, cha, cha, blup, blup, blup, cha, cha, rrrup, blup, blup, blup. She's had enough. Early last year in Florida, in Sea World of Florida an animal trainer was killed by a Killer whale. Huh... Turns out there is a reason they didn't name them ocean ponies. [laughter] Some things are exactly as they seem folks. Killer whales kill, pilot whales wear dark sunglasses. I'm not sure how the sperm whale got his name, but I'm not getting into the pool. [laughter] That whale got its job back. They put that whale back in the show. And now when I first saw it on the internet I'm like this will be world news, wasn't even news at all they put the whale back, this whale killed 3 people this is a serial killer whale. And he got his job back? If that would have happened at the sea word of Texas that whale would've went straight to the fucking electric pool. And that's just a regular pool with a toaster thrown in it. People think they are expensive to make but its like 14 bucks. You can reuse the extension cord. People don't know that. Get another toaster. They busted a sushi restaurant last year in L.A. selling whale. They fined them 200,000 bucks. That is so fucking wrong man, to take a 50,000 pound majestic animal and serve it up two tiny slices at a time. Oh that's good, got any more? Shit yeah we do. We have a shit load. We make a big commitment. I don't know how it got caught. Maybe that 14 foot fin hanging out of the dumpster. I should've closed the rid. Yeah, probably should closed the rid. I live in Atlanta half the year and last summer in Atlanta an idiot teenager was decapitated at a major amusement park in Atlanta on a very famous rollercoaster, and now what I thought happened was he was on the ride stood up and got his head cut off. That's not what happened. What happened was while he was on the ride his hat flew off. And when he got off the ride he climbed over 2 fences and went through 2 gates, telling him not to, to retrieve this hat. Which it turns out he really didn't need after all. [laughter] Why that story is dripping with irony Mr. White. This is the part of the show that I prove my job is better than yours. Cheers. You guys are fantastic. Thank you so much for coming out on Saturday and listening. [applause] I was at home last week and my nephew called our house and I never answer the phone at my house ever, and I think he was surprised that I did. He goes... uncle Ron... is that you? I said yeah it's me. He goes uncle Ron did you know its okay to be gay? This is why I don't answer the fucking phone at my house right there. [laughter] Now it's my problem. And your right it's okay to be gay. Do you know what gay means? That's when a man likes a man or a woman likes a woman, but they can't have babies. Pretty close. You believe that a 6 year old, this kid knows what gay means. I didn't know what gay meant till I started hitchhiking. [laughter] I wrote a book 7 silly secrets truckers just don't want you to know. [laughter] My wife and I are big fans of the reality tv show on HBO called Pornucopia Sex in the Valley. It's a reality show about the pornography industry in the San Fernando Valley, which is where most of it's made. And uh, we bought the first season cause it's fucking hilarious and this one episode was about guys that were straight porn stars but they were doing gay porn cause it pays 5 times the money. They're interviewing this guy. He goes yeah I was in a scene yesterday with 5 guys at the same time and I'm not even gay. I was like you're gayer than I am. [laughter] If you can even think about what to do with 5 dicks at the same time your way fucking gayer than I am. (hand gestures) [laughter] I was having... this is the gay part of my show. I was having dinner the other night with this CBS executive and uh who I've known for years great fucking dude. And he's gay and I've never said a word to him about being gay, I just knew that he was and we are having dinner in the Beverly Hills talking about a potential show. And this chick walks into the restaurant, this L.A. smoking fucking hot man, probably an actress or model, and she was an ilf. Which means I don't care is she has children. I don't think the letters line up but that's what it means. And she sits at a table kind of near us by herself and I had a couple of bottles of wine with dinner and a couple of scotches before that. I was pretty drunk. I said you mean to tell me that does nothing for you? And he looked at her and goes not a thing. I said you mean you would rather have sex with me than her? Not by much. [laughter] What if I lost some weight, I'm doing yoga, and I'm eating ham free carrot cake. My dick has ears. [laughter] That's my favorite thing about L.A. The people out there are so god damn pretty. I'll tell you how it happened back in the 20's they started making movies out there, and when they did all these beautiful people from all over America flocked the fuck out there to be in the movies and they couldn't all be in the movies. Some of them got regular jobs but they met those people who were in the movies. They got together and had beautiful babies and those babies grew and met other babies from the same area. They got together and had even more beautiful babies, and almost the exact opposite thing is happening right now in Kansas. [laughter] Kansas is full of ugly quitters. Have you ever been there? It's true those people that live on the fucking west coast their forefathers got on the Oregon trail fought hardships you and I couldn't dream of, with starvation and weather, crossing the Rocky mountains. Not those people in Kansas, their forefathers got on the Oregon Trail St. Louis, Missouri they got to Kansas said fuck it I'm staying here and I'm going to fuck that fat girl right over there. [laughter] We had a baby it looks like a potato. And that potato grew up and met another potato from the same town and abracadabra Topeka. My wife came home from the store the other day and she goes I was in the produce department today and this guy told me I was beautiful, well baby he's right you are beautiful. Yeah but he said it. Well I'm saying it now you're beautiful. Yeah but he said it. Really you ever overdraw his checking account? [laughter] You ever drive his brand new Mercedes straight through the fucking garage door. That ever happened to that guy. It happened to me and I think your so hot I fuck you anyway. And if your one of these guys going around the grocery stores telling married women they're beautiful, hey fuck you! Kill your own chicken you mother chicken killing. My wife's best friend has an autistic child named Louis. Louis is 12 years old, he's the sweetest child I have ever known. I've known him since he was 6. We were at their house labor day, Louis informed me that he was gonna run the 40 yard dash for the Special Olympics at Wynnett High School where I live in Atlanta. He asked me if I'd come hoot for him. I said Louis I'd love to come hoot for you I just need to check my schedule and he goes we checked it you're clear. [laughter] Well then I'm your man, Louis. And I got to admit I was dreading it, and then I ended up having fun. I thought it was going to be sad that's why I was dreading it. It's a celebration is what it is. People are tailgating they're not painting their faces and bellies blue, but they're cooking sausages getting hammered, betting on these races. [laughter] Make no mistake about it they are betting on these races. And it's not easy to handicap a race you got 17 special needs kids in 6 lanes you don't know what the fuck's going to happen. When they fire that starting pistol they could scatter, stop drop and roll. We saw it all that day they're not drug testing these kids. [laughter] And they announced the 40 yard dash and I was making a little wager on my man Louis which I did for a 100 bucks and I was looking down at the track like I'm up in the stands I was trying to figure out which one is Louis, which isn't easy cause they all wear the exact same thing. They wear Special Olympics t-shirts, Special Olympics shorts which they got that day. But you can wear whatever footwear you want. And little Louis for whatever reason had chosen yellow rubber boots. [laughter] Which didn't make sense at first but then it started raining. Fuck if this thing goes off road, I got a natural mudder and Louis won. The Yellow Blur. [applause]] That's what I call him now the Yellow Blur. He loves that nickname. His mother called me the other day and she goes will you please call Louis the Yellow Blur. Put him on the phone. You're the Yellow Bluuuur. Bing! It's not like professional sports, you go to a Lakers game you wave at Kobe Bryant till your arm falls off he won't wave back to you. Louis waved back to you in the middle of the fucking race he doesn't give a shit. Louis is fan friendly. Louis will stop and sign an autograph, the Yellow Blur. I took my son tater tot to Europe this summer. [applause] My son is 21 years old now, he's in college getting his masters in entertainment business. He's a great kid man he's, I'm so proud of him. He's smart, he's funny, he has my brains high end peaks without my low-end problems. That some good god damn news for daddy right there. We've been monitoring it. He's funny I was doing a corporate gig in Orlando where he goes to college and I was backstage with him and I don't get asked to do a ton of corporate gigs cause what you want your corporate image to be. [laughter] We were hoping for an overweight alcoholic that smokes and cusses. Let's call Louis, see if Ron's free. Anyway I'm backstage in the green room with my son. And I wear wild socks and because I do people give me bizarre socks for whatever reason, and I'm backstage with my son, I'm putting on these weird socks and Marshall goes, uh dad those socks are gay. I say chicks dig these socks; he goes chicks wear those socks. [laughter] All right he's my kid you can stop those tests. I love his mom. His mom is great she's my second wife; I never argued with her ever when she didn't want to be married to somebody who was always going to be on the road, and the only argument I remember having with her was when he was a toddler about whether or not to spank him. Her contention was if you had an argument with an adult and disagreed with them, you certainly wouldn't hit them. I said I would if they peed in my face. [laughter] I'm not kidding pee in my face see what the fuck happens. She busted him with internet porn when he was 15, and I felt so sorry for him. She called me just squawking. I felt horrible for the kid because when I was 15 I was so horny I could jack off to the Sears catalog and that's just big girl panties and lawn mowers. I can't imagine being 15 years old and having an unstoppable stream of pornography piped straight into your god damn bedroom. When I was a kid I had to earn porn man. You had to wait till your friends dad went out of town on business. You had to pull down a wrink-a-dee spring-loaded attic ladder, you had to crawl up into a dusty spider ridden fucking crawl space, forge through cardboard boxes until you find a 8mm reel. Then what? Learn how to work a fucking projector, that's what! [laughter] And after all that you got silent bushy porn. And if there was a sound track it was always something fucked up you couldn't understand it. Is he going to stick his finger in her ear? No his penis is in her rear watch the movie. We had one friend that was two years younger than us, and he went she put it in her mouth! I didn't know she was going to put it in her mouth. She's going to need to brush her teeth. [laughter] Not yet but she will watch the film. Note to self: put it in her mouth. So Laurie, that's my ex wife, she goes you're going to need to talk to your son about sex, it's time. I said well you're right it is. She goes when are you going to do it Ron? I said he's going to be at the house this weekend, so I'll talk to him then. I said okay fine. Marshall turn off the television. Turn it off I need to talk to you. Alright. I said I want to talk to you about sex. He goes oh dad come on. I said no you're 15 years old it's time we had this talk, he goes okay. I said the clitoris is as sensitive as an eyeball... [laughter] [laughter] Was that it? That's all I got. [laughter] Don't go rubbing on it I it's dry. Turn that tv back on boy. What about safe sex dad? It's never safe their husbands always come home that's a fucking myth. He's so smart; I can't believe how smart kids are today. He can answer any question that you can come up with in 2 seconds off his phone. He is a computer freak anyway, but you ask any question doesn't matter, world geography, world history, a note in a song written 300 hundred years ago. There it is. When I was a kid I had to believe my mother. That's it that's all I had. My mom where do rainbows come from? Well 3,000 years ago an 800 year old named Noah was commissioned by the Lord to build a giant ship, and all the animals 2 by 2. You try and run that crap by a kid today they're like click, click bullshit. Click, click, porn! People fucking on my phone. If my mother didn't know the answer to a question I had to go to the library. Which is a building, where they used to store the knowledge. Now it's just a place where homeless people piss. My mother used to drop me off at the library when I was a kid, I was always so intimidated by it because it was so big and you had to be quiet cause the knowledge is sleeping. You had to learn a decibel system made up by some fuck named Dewey. Then you had to peruse a 100 thousand square foot building with volumes of knowledge from floor to ceiling, from ceiling to floor. You had to cross reference Dewey's bullshit with the author's name and the card catalog, and you finally get to the place where the knowledge you seek suppose to be and it might not fucking be there. Where's the knowledge that I seek? Yes somebody else has got it. When are they going to bring it back? They keep it for a month for a nickel. How am I supposed to learn what I need to know? You ask your mother? My mother doesn't know how to work a projector... [laughter] She's in dental school for fuck sake. Don't try and do the math on that bit it will just fuck you up. This one guy actually stopped my show a few weeks ago, and he goes, now wait a minute if this summer you were back in Las Vegas that's when you broke your tooth. That's when your mother went to dental school and now your 7 years old and you say your mother was already in dental school. What? Dude really? You had no problem with Pearl jumping on my stomach and saying she can have all babies at the same time, but the math on this one joke got you so fucked up you just have to talk. I tell you the internet changed everything man. Certainly changed the way people don't buy music. You know, the record industry is on its ear man, because what they manufacture became easier to steal than it is to buy. And that's just a fact of nature these days. And they'll figure it out. They used to sell millions of comedy albums, now its hard to sell them just cause it's so easy to rip it off just click, click out of my IRA in to your I fucking pod. [laughter] When I was a kid you had to get a ride to Sears, which is a building. You had to find the record department on your own. Then you had to cram a 12 inch by 12 inch album down your shorts, then you had to "Spongebob Squarepants it" with Led Zeppelin 2 crammed down your fucking pants hoping no body was going to catch your ass. That's stealing music. [laughter] We didn't have Viagra you had to like somebody to fuck them. [laughter] I'm kidding you didn't either, you didn't either. You could grudge fuck the hell out of them. We didn't have blue mountains on our beer cans to tell you if they were cold. You had to open the refrigerator reach in there and touch that beer can or you would never know. [laughter] But somebody somewhere went, what if we only had some sort of thermostat on each individual can like a mountain changing color to see the optimum drink temperature. Thank you rocky mountain, even though your beer taste like ass. [laughter] Those mountains should turn brown. So I tour, that's what I do, I go from city to city to city I've done it for 27 years I've been coming to Austin all 27 of those years. From the Velveeta room to the laugh stop to the Capitol City Comedy Club to the Paramount, to the Paramount, to the Paramount, to the Paramount it's my favorite room in the whole wide fucking world man. [applause]] I tour with my wife usually and I love to tour with my wife because I only have sex with my wife I don't have sex with other women. I have been married 3 times and that hasn't always been my policy. When I was young I used to talk to my cousins about this race we were going to have to see who gets married first I came in 2nd, 4th, and 7th. [laughter] I feel like my wife mislead me a little bit when we first started got together. When we first got together she was all about, you know what I don't ever want to have children. I'm just one of those women that never felt the urge to give birth and I don't like real diamonds. I don't like them cause of that blood diamond thing; you know what I like to do suck dick and cook. To suck dick and like to cook, in fact when I'm not cooking I'm sucking dick and when I'm not sucking dick I am cooking. In fact if there was a way I could suck your dick while I was cooking, if we got a stool and you stood on it and I could blow you while I'm scrambling some eggs wearing fake jewelry, not having a baby all at the same time. That would be heaven for me. Fa fa me too! Cut to 5 years later she's on the phone with China trying to adopt a baby. She has a diamond on her finger looks like a solar fucking heating unit; I'm jacking off eating a tv dinner. [laughter] I wonder what she's got on underneath that Snuggie? [laughter] I bet she is naked as shit under that Snuggie. We have a great sex life. You ever sixty-nine someone so long you started to miss each other. Then the snow turned to rain. I love you. April, may, I need some food, and we both could use a shave. [laughter] We did it so long one time it turned into another number. [laughter] What is this a 71? You got your toe in my nose what the fuck. My wife has a new move in the bedroom. My wife's new move in the bedroom is look at me, look at me. Open your eyes Ron... And look at me, and that's a lot of pressure. It is to look in the eyes of the women you love while your making love and to look deep into her soul and still see another woman. What the fuck are you doing here? I thought you got hit by a bus. I'm great at sex I come every time. I'm like 4,000 in a row or some ridiculous god damn number, I'm gifted really I guess. My wife is maybe a third as good as me. I don't think she is trying. I asked her the other day what's the problem here baby? Well for one thing there is a fat sweaty guy laying on top of me. [laughter] Well that break my concentration, get off me dude I'm trying to come. That's not true right before I come I have the focus of a Navy Seal. Afterwards I lay there like a wounded Manatee. [laughter] Poke him with a stick see if he moves. My wife gives the best head if you ever have a chance. [laughter] The first time my wife gave me a blowjob my hands went numb, I'm either having a stroke or this girl knows her way around a wiener. I told her when she got finished that was the best damn blowjob I've ever had in my life by a lot. She goes I know it's kind of weird because I used to be not so good at it. I was talking to my friend Ted, the florist, that lives down the street and just asked him how he does it. [laughter] You suck my dick like Ted the florist?! [laughter] That motherfucker knows what he's doing I'll tell you that. Now every time I see ted I tell him you should open a school dude. Call it Ted's head. Tulips for every occasion. You could open a head and breakfast, [laughter] And then what would my slogan be? Food it's the only thing that doesn't suck. [laughter] You guys have been fantastic. I'm going to close with my, oh... [laughter] So nobody is watching the dogs I guess. I'll try to get pearl to play bite my face. Pearl's favorite thing, she can have all my babies at the same time, her favorite thing in the world is for me to bite her face, because she is like a billy goat fucking elbow, it has no feeling in it. So I lay down on the floor, sometimes, she didn't do it last show so you have to be quiet. If 1 tell her to bite my face, she will run up and jump up and bite my face. Pearl who wants to play bite my face. [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] That went way better then I thought it would. I'm gonna, I'm gonna to close the show this evening with uh my Dr. Phil story. Dr. Phil McGraw is a friend of mine. We play golf together all the time out in Los Angeles and uh he is a great guy you never know. We became friends from him being a fan. And uh you never know you see somebody on tv what they are going to be like in person. Doc's a solid fucking dude I guarantee you that. He's straight as can be he's a great fucking hang. And he's a great asset for me, my father passed away when I was young and now I'm in this big business world. And uh I can bounce all these things I got going on off of Doc and his 35 lawyers. [laughter] And that's a big deal for me and I'm really good friends with his son Jay McGraw and anyway the other day I was talking to my son about self-esteem, and a few days later I was playing golf with Doc. I said, Doc if you were going to tell somebody one thing to do make them feel better about who they are what would it be? And he said finish the things you start and I said well that's brilliant, and I went home there was half a bottle of scotch sitting on the counter. [laughter] I think I know what he's getting at. That's not my Dr. Phil story, here's my Dr. Phil story. Every year Doc and his family rent a yacht for 12 days in the Mediterranean and that's their vacation. It's the only way he can get away you know. Cause he is the most famous person in America, he is the most recognizable face, 6 foot 4, bald dome head, porn mustache. You can stop him from any fucking where. And because he seems so approachable on television and he really is approachable, I mean he's a sweetheart of a dude. But people are always, when he goes out in public, what what about this. That's fine at first, but eventually it will eat the skin off your fucking bones. If you can't walk out of your house without somebody going. Hey my brother-in-law is all fucked up in the head, I was wondering if you can stick around for just a second... Come back here. Asshole! And that's exactly how it happens I've seen it, so that's what they do. Well last, this summer my wife and I went on vacation to France and Monaco. And I need a break too sometimes I do 140 cities a year I work; I do more dates than any other comic. More cities than any other comic working today because I just love fucking doing it. And twenty minutes from now nobody is going to give a fuck about what I have to say so while they do I believe I'll do a lot of shows. Hey! So we're in France and Monaco. Having a great time, I'm really in love with my wife she is so talented. We have a fun life together, we're there and then one day the phone rings and its Doc. He goes aren't you guys in Monaco? I said yeah. He goes we're going to be in Monaco tomorrow why don't you guys come party on the yacht? I said fuck yeah. [laughter] Which is what you say if somebody says you want to come party on the yacht. Fuck yeah. In fact lets try it one time, you want to come party on the yacht? Fuck yeah. I don't have a yacht. [laughter] So I was like yeah fuck this is great, man we're excited. We're were staying in the Fairmont Hotel overlooking the little yacht harbor in Monaco. We were down there looking at the yachts the day before. We were like wouldn't it be cool if you knew somebody you could hop on and just throw down. This is everybody's yacht, this is yacht heaven. This is Steve Wynn's yacht, Prince Albert of Monaco's yacht. This is that Russian dude with the tiny giraffes. [laughter] Anyway they're coming in at 6:30 the next evening. So the next morning we wake up, the next afternoon we wake up. We go have this amazing lunch. We're drinking this great wine from, France probably if I had to guess. That'd be my guess, which I did, have to guess. France! We have this great day, sex. The next day we walk to down to the harbor and sure enough Doc is backing in a 165 foot yacht. I don't know if that's how they do it or not. The only way to get on the yacht is to walk up this gangplank to get on the yacht. I'm walking on the gangplank going nobody's stopping me. We get on the yacht and there's our friends from California half way around the world, are you fucking kidding me. How much fun are we having, I'm hugging everybody. There's a bunch of people on the yacht we're on. Anytime I'm hugging you and I'm in a strange place, what I'm really just looking over your shoulder trying to find a bar. That's why I'm turning you. I see the bar and right in the dead front center of the bar is a bottle of famous Black Grouse. Which is a Scotch I started drinking when I was in Scotland for the Open Championship at Turnburry. You start looking at what the Scots drink, and that's what they drink. And I'm like oh fuck yes. They had a bottle of it and its kind of hard to find. The bartender poured me a big old glass of whiskey, way bigger then this one. I'm in such a great mood, it tasted better than any fucking scotch tasted ever. Good Lord that tasted like butter honey aged in Lindsay Lohan's pussy? [laughter] It tasted so good I decided to skip dinner. And just have a couple more of them. Scare me up another one of these. How about one more, alright. 1 hadn't had a drink since lunch, I was thirsty. I was going at it. Doc noticed I was really drinking hard, he goes boy you're really drinking tonight Ron. I said yeah, Doc some nights it just tastes like spring water. He goes why don't you just drink spring water Ron? [laughter] I don't know I'm not a fucking doctor. [laughter] So this is going on for fucking hours. Now they really love Margo, they really love my wife Margo. Margo has sung on Dr. Phil's show a few times, and they go everywhere to see her. Margo is a four and a half octave classical trained opera singer that sings rock and roll and jazz, and whatever, she's been singing here for years. Robin McGraw loves to goad my wife into singing, and my wife loves to be goaded into singing. So they make a great little fucking team. So were on the back of this yacht. Robin goes come on Margo sing for us. Margo gets up, there's people on the back partying of all these yachts and bars on the pier. Margo gets up, and they love jazz in France and Monaco. They have jazz clubs all over the place. She gets up and sings a jazz standard, at full voice. I don't get to hear her at full voice. When she sings at full voice I cry. She finishes the first song at full voice all the people on these yachts stood up and started cheering. I forgot they're huge jazz fans in France and Monaco. She gets up does another song, people are cheering. People gathered up around the back of this boat by song four, there's 400 people behind the boat, listening to her sing you can hear a pin drop, and she is just killing it. I have a little secret. I'm fucking hammered man, I'm so drunk. I can't even believe it my fucking self how drunk I am. I'm like Jesus Christ. I would get a drink and I'd take one little sip out of it and talk to somebody, then look back and its empty. I'm like is anyone else drinking out of this glass. [laughter] Miscalculations - she does like 7-8 songs, she goes, okay guys that's enough. She sits down and Doc goes well Ron you wanna do something? [laughter] I've got to preface this with Doc's on vacation with his best friend and head lawyer and his wife, Mary Pat. They're Baptists from Dallas, they're a little fucking straight. [laughter] They're about to find out my secret. [laughter] About 20 years ago I was doing a bit that was so vile, that I only did it for about a week. Then I quit doing it, because this is not the direction I want to take my crowds or my show. I have no idea why I picked that night to dust her off and take her for a spin. [laughter] The other day I was tit fucking Mamie Eisenhower. Right before I came, my dick slipped and when straight down her tracheal tubes. Here's the moral question, do you pull out or dump a load into her lungs? Yachts are pulling up anchor on both sides of us as fast as they can pull them up. They're leaving the harbor so fast there's a surfable wake. There is stampede of tiny giraffes diving off the pier. Swimming towards the ocean and certain death. People are pulling their kids off the pier. I don't think they heard me I'm going to do it again. Doc goes that's enough out of you Ron. Margo is tapping me out. You ever been tapped out. Let's go baby, time to go she's seen it. Come on baby its time for us to go back to the hotel. Come on Ron. Mumbles. I speak fluent drunk, that means I don't know why you want to leave I'm having a perfectly good time. It turns out there was a consensus. [laughter] Okay I'll leave. The only way to get off this yacht is to walk back off that gangplank. At the end of that gang plank there is a 18" drop off. My wife's in front of me, Margo is in front of me, then I get to the end of the gangplank, and Doc goes big step Ron. I say thanks Doc, thinking I made a big step towards something. I don't know he is the big psychologist, not me. It's amazing how much speed you can pick up in 18", [laughter] It's nothing like falling over on the same level that you're already on. I slammed down to that fucking pier, I landed square on this elbow, dislocated this shoulder, put a 4 inch gash down the back of my arm and I was so drunk I bounced off that pier. [laughter] Fade to black. I wake up the next morning with the shoo buddies. All I can do is lay there in bed, and go shoo buddy. I can't move my shoulder, shoo buddy. My shirt stuck to my arm with blood and giraffe hair and whatever the fuck else you find on a pier, shoo buddy. I have a wet jolly rancher in my armpit. Sour apple. Had to cut it out with a pair of scissors. You almost can't eat them after that. [laughter] Shoo buddy. I slowly open my aching fucking eyes, and there's Margo. [laughter] What happened? [laughter] You got really drunk last night Ron. What did I do? Well you did the tit fucking Mamie Eisenhower story. Did Mary Pat laugh? [laughter] Mary Pat left is what Mary Pat did. Shoo buddy. You think they're going to invite us back over to party on the yacht today? She goes I don't know what's going to happen now Ron I don't know. She walks out of the room, slams the door. I just start berating myself. Why do you do that Ron? Why do get so drunk it ruins things for other people. Why can't you just drink like a regular god damn person? You have a wonderful son, a beautiful wife and great career. Why don't you make some changes in your life that will make a difference in the long run. About then the phone rang and it was Doc and he goes are you guys going to come party on the yacht and I go fuck yeah. [laughter] Thanks for playing along. I've never performed for a better crowd in my god damn life. Bless you hearts for listening so intently. Thank you. [applause]
