Wait. Hey, hey, wait. Let me take a rest. Grandpa, I lost an earring. Jesus. Help me find it. Why do you run with earrings? I didn't even think I'll lose it. You're careless. Let me help you. Grandpa. Grandpa. What is it? Grandpa. Look! "Suburb Murder" What was your reaction at the sight of the dead woman? I was so scared. My grandpa passed out too. So I went downhill and called the police. Did you see anyone or anything else? No... I was really scared, I didn't see anything! Miss, calm down. Think it over, and tell me slowly. I didn't, really. Sir, may I go now? I gotta see my grandpa. Stay a little while. I'm getting another colleague here. Morning, Sir. - Sit down. - Thank you, Sir. The superior's so concerned about Braemar Hill's case. Now we're setting up an ad hoc group and issuing a bounty of 50,000 dollars in order to close the case as soon as possible. I'm leaving this case to you. Yes, Sir. The superior's so concerned on this case. That's why we have this ad hoc group. The initial information is all in this file. Everyone gets a copy now. Any news from the headquarters? Not now. Hey, it's coming. The post-mortem analysis. "Victim: female, foreign, aged 17-23." "Over 500 wounds." "Cause of death..." - Wow, kids are fierce nowadays. - Yeah. That's why the superior cares so much. We must teach this boy a lesson if we got him. Okay, all right. Paul's checked something out. Get back and have a rest. Be standby here tomorrow morning. We're in action anytime, okay? Yes, Sir. It's the police. Let's go. - Stop... - Freeze! Stop! Stay right there. The other way! - Follow me. - Okay. Let's split. - You go that way. - Okay. - Don't run! - Stop. Keung, let's go. Check it out there. Don't move. Go, go on! Stand up! - Cuff him! - Yes, Sir. Stand up. - Still wanna run? - No. Move, move your ass. Son, you should confess. Out with it! Are you dumb? Trying to fool me around? Enough. He's just a boy. Sit aside. Be smart. Be smart and admit your guilt. We got enough evidence to charge you. Several of your accomplices were arrested. They've confessed that you were one of the rapists. If you admit it, we could intercede for you to the judge. Think about it. Sir, I want a smoke. Cheung Yau-Hong. Miss. What are you doing here? Waiting for my dad to take me home for the festival. Miss, can I go home on my own? No. Not without your parent here to get you. You aren't a clever boy. You don't do well in study. You can't play as you wish like good students. Get back to your dorm and study. Go on. Chai? Hong. What are you doing here? Let's go out and play together. No, I can't. Miss said I can only leave without my parent. Then I'll get in to join you. Don't. I don't want to spoil your festival day. Doesn't matter. Just a while. No way. The school gate is closed. I got it. No. Miss will scold me. Don't worry. She won't know that. Are you all right? I'm all right. - Be careful. - Oh. Let's go. Don't be shy. - It's hard to get this chance. - So thirsty. No. Shall I cut my chest and show you my heart? You're a badass. Why are you shy? Your husband isn't here. Not really. He's down there playing tile game. Keep it down. He won't quit playing soon. He doesn't know you're here. No. Why are you so thirsty? I'm always missing you. No, let's not make haste. Are you okay? Okay. But it hurts a little bit here. Shall we play lantern tonight? Sure. What's wrong? You look quite unhappy. Don't you want to play with me? Yes, but... But what? Tell me. No one cares about me now. My father doesn't give me a damn. You are my only friend. You can't treat me like them. My dad's taking me to the US to make a living. Don't be sad. I have an amulet here, I'll give it to you. It was a gift from my mom just before she died. It's an amulet. Keep it with you properly. Thank you. I'll give you this slingshot. Thank you. Do remember to write me by then. - You're a badass. - Yeah, I am. Come on, Four. Four. Here, have a drink first. Our drinks are here. Let me get you some cups. No need to. We'll just drink directly. Let's drink. - Ming, go get the phone. - I got it. Thank you. Bro Cheung, it's for you. Seems from the school. What? From the school? Who is it? Excuse me for a while. Take your time. Hello, who is it? What is it? What? You drink it without me. Shit, how dare you come back, you little bastard! - You dare play truant? - Dad. You dare play truant? - I won't dare to! Don't beat me. - You shitty truant, I must kill you little bastard, I must kill you. See where you can go! You'll be sorry when I get you. Dad, I won't dare to! You shitty truant! I'll kill you! Hey, you infernal fucking bastard! - You dare fuck my wife? - No... Fuck off! Don't stand in the way. Let me kill this son of a bitch. You screw my wife? Put the gun down. - Don't do anything wrong! - I'll blow your head off, bastard. You ungrateful asshole. Go to hell. I'll shoot your brain out! - Don't do this! - Bitch, don't stand in the way. Get off me. - Get the fuck off me! - Run away, Hoi. Don't go! Get him! Don't let him get away! - Don't move! - Hey, stop! You cuckold me! Goddamnit! You bloody filthy whore! Just drop dead! You exposed me, you little bastard! If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have married your damned bastard dad! Fuck you! What did you say? - Will you stop beating? - What if I won't? Alright, I quit, and I'll never ever come back. Get the fuck out! Don't you ever come back again, you dirty cunt. And you little bastard. Why were you back? Dad, all I want to do is celebrate the festival. Cele-the-fuck-brate. No one here has time to celebrate shit with you. Now it's great that your mom has gone. That's what you're back here for. You're a douchebag as your mom. All you bring me is trouble, I'll never in good luck with the two of you around. Dad, I won't dare to! I'll be good! I'm telling you. Don't come home again. Just live in the dorm. If I see you here next time, I'll break your legs, bloody brat! - No, dad! - What? Get your hands off me. I'm telling you. Don't come home again. Just live in the dorm. If I see you here next time, I'll break your legs, bloody brat! Hey, get up, it's time for work. Hey, get up! Rotten boy, you won't get up until shoveled, will you? Man, they're all left for work. - There's a fire! - No way! Where? It's time for work! Hey, stop it. Now it's the final segment. Quick-quick is taking the lead. Treasure Town is second behind it with Good Days neck and neck. Have a bet, you'll win. Hey, wash it too. - Me again? - You don't work, do you? - Does it work? - Just do it. - Which horse? - Gusco! - Good results? - It's catching up! Go! Go! - Wow, Big Rice is awesome! - Go! Serves you right. I've told you to buy Big Rice. Idiot, are you saying it's all my fault? You can't say that! Hey, what are you doing here? Are you making trouble? Boss, it's just a play time. Play? I pay you to play here? Get the fuck out of here! You're cocky, huh? Then pay us the wages now. Wages? Fuck your wages! You've broken all my stuff. Now you pay for my loss. Fuck your loss. You has such guts that you refuse to pay. Don't be arrogant. We'll see one day. Let's go. - You be fucking careful! - Let's go. You motherfuckers, fuck you... This way... - I got you. - Good stuff to read. - Give it to me. - Wow, stunning. - Let me read. - Don't grab me. - What now? - It's mine. Hey... cut it out! Give it back to me. Come on! Give it back! - Let's exchange. - Here you are. - Go away. - Hey... Hey, what's wrong? Just see right here, correct? I don't want it anymore! Are you kidding me? Can you be careful when you play around? We can't play around? I didn't say that, but stay away, please. What? Are you pissed off? - I'll fuck your ass! - I'll beat you up! Let's go somewhere else. It's merely you outnumber us. Fuck, what kind of speech was that? You won't get away with this. Don't be rude. I'll call the police. Hey. Forget it. Go after them. Don't go, bastard, stop! Still running? You bloody jerk, let me got your ass. - You don't stop? - Stop, asshole! Are you okay? Leave me alone, you run for life! - Don't run! - No! No! Bastard, I'll let you go! - Don't do it, Ngau. - Fuck off. - Run! Run! - Don't beat him, Ngau! Now we got you. Toss her to me. Where are you going, pretty? - Help! - Don't move. What do you want? Yours! Help! Give her to me... Take off her clothes. - Nice tits and hips, so hot! - Bouncy. Go away. She still tries to run! Chase! Where can you go, pretty? Let's get laid. Fucker! You dare slap me? Slap me? Help! No! Oh, help! Let me alone. No. Carry her over there. - Stop! No! - So hot. - Let me smell. - Help! Don't move! Stay still, bitch! - Tie him up. - Yeah. - No! - So sweet. Don't move. Go away. Watch him over. I'm gonna help them up there. You dare hit me! Wow, how could you do this without waiting for me? Go away. Let me get her. Don't move, bitch. Bang her hard! Faster! Fuck her! Fuck her! Hey, what are you doing? Hey, cut it. Someone's here. Let's move! - Now! Move! - Move your ass! Hey, could we beat him too badly? What are you afraid of? He's too proud. I must teach him a lesson. If not, I'll call him papa. Give it up. We'll be easily recognized. Idiot, use your brain. We have to use a sack or something on his head. That's true. You hear me? Hey... he's coming. What are you doing? - Hit him! - Quickly, quickly! You arrogant dick, I'll beat your ass... Go to hell! - Throw him out! - Sure! No! No! Cop! Cop! Hurry up! Hey, boy, freeze! Move! Stop running! Stop the car! Get out, pal! - Hong! Is it you? - It's you? Let's talk later, I'm being chased. What's the matter? Drive, sir! Come on, take a seat. Hey, dude, it's been a long while. How come you didn't inform me of your return? I meant to give you a surprise! Seeing you just now, I thought you were robbing someone. Fortunately, I recognize you. You think I'm a robber? The boss is a douchebag. So my friends have to give him a big. How could you beat someone up just because of that? Hey, stay away from this kind of friends. I can't help it. My dad cast me off, and my mom went away. I knew them at work, so we started to live together. Oh, what's your plan coming back here? No plan. My dad's dead, I couldn't make a living in the US, and then I got driven out. So I came back to Hong Kong to try my luck. My closest acquaintance here is you. So I'm just seeking your assistance, I'm not sure if you can say that... Have you found a place to live? Not yet. I've just got off the plane and I meant to go to see you. But I met you halfway by chance. In this case... don't hesitate. Come and live with me. With you? Am I keeping you back? Not a problem. We're old good friends. Hey, I'll show you something. - See if you can guess what it is. - What is it? Ta-da! Your souvenir! Wow, you still have it now? Hey, how about mine? - It's here. - Let me see. - See if it's worn. - Of course not. Hey, you were fat then. Why are you so slim now? Did you court girls too much? Court shit. I didn't even have enough to eat. - Courting girls? Idiot. - No way. Tell me about your life there. Let me tell you later, I'm so hungry now, okay? Damn it, okay! Let's go! Sure, let's go! Come, stand up. Turn them around and around. - I got you! - My bad luck! Get me now, come on... Come on. Comfy? - Are you done? - Done. Hey, where are you going? Did we come to the wrong place? No, I live here all these years. - Here? - Yeah. Hey, cut it out. So you're back? Let's play together. Come over. - Come, don't be shy. - You're back. Who is he? My brother. Your brother? You take care of him, I'm taking a bath. Hong, who is he? This is Chai, the guy I mentioned often. - Your friend in the US? - Yeah. What's he doing here? Nothing. He just got off the plane, having no place to live. So he's staying here for the moment. Your brother is my brother. There's a lot of space here. Hey, I have something else to do. Make yourself at home. Okay. Hey, sit down. - Hey. - What is it? It doesn't seem right. Are you shy? You'll get used to it soon. We are all guys. - No. - Why not? Put your things away here. Come on. Is the rent here cheap? Sort of. It's just these two bastards. Get them! Let's run! Stop right there, jerks! Motherfuckers... go to die... You bastard, you're dead this time. Chai! - Don't go! - Beat him! Let's move! - Chai, are you okay? - I'm okay. After you met Chai again, did you commit crimes with your four pals? No. How about your family? No family. I don't want to talk about them. How is it? You must be tired. Get some rest outside. Hong, I know it's your family background that caused you these problems. You better listen to me. We just want to help you now. Come on. Tell me the truth, where're your parents now? I don't know. They never cared about me. - Hurry up. - Hey, what are you doing? Why are you walking so fast? - Just because you're a big guy. - It's just you walk slow. Let's see how fast you fuck later. Hey I'm buying some bread over there. - Hey, let's go. - Forget the bread. "Taoyuan Hotel" Boss, any chicks here? Sure... get in the room first. Come on in. - Let's go. - Here... Gentlemen, do you have any acquaintances here? Boss, all we need is big tits. Sure... What takes these chicks so long? Why didn't you let me eat something? What? Are you shy? - No way. - Let me teach you later. Is she okay? Say it if not. Good for him, as long as she has big boobs. You're so nice. Don't pretend. Just a moment, then. - Bring more chicks here. - Big boobs. Come with me. Girl, I'm awesome at it. - Yeah? - Can you take it? They don't seem to have enough hookers. We have only one left. Will it do? I mean threesome. I can give you discount if I like. What shall we do? Let's do it. Show her how good we are. Oh yeah, better than none. - Okay for you? - Better than none. - Just one win. - Just once. - Paper... - Scissors. - Just stand by. - You win every time. Come out. We got clients. Hard to have another one. Looks good? If not, none is available then. Good! Hey, do me a favor and get away from here. Hey, come on, come on. Come on, hurry up. - You don't need a chick? - No, thank you. - Are you sure? - No, thanks. Sit and wait then. Don't go too hard, okay? It's your turn. Hey, I'm gonna get a cigarette. Do your best. Hey, give me a cigarette. What takes you so long? Of course it's long, as we are two on one. So it's you. How filthy can you go? Who are you? I don't even know you. Of course you don't know me. You eloped with a man when I was little. Are you Hong? Did you ever care about me? Bitch...! Shut up! If I hadn't had you, I wouldn't have been like this now. You put all the blame on me. Just take it that you never had a son. - Oh no. - Hong. Forget it. I don't think your mom wants things this way. She doesn't? She's just greedy. Even she's unlucky, she shouldn't be so sluttish. I think... I think your mom... I think she's miserable too... That serves her right. Why wasn't she with my dad? She intrigued with a man and complained I'm the family's burden. She beat me every day, I'd say she's a born slut. She likes being banged by men. Very good, she's banged every day now. Happy now? She's so satisfied. Hey, don't judge your mom like that, will you? You can't just peck at it. Your mom had choice but to marry your dad because of you. Your dad hadn't treated her right all those years? Do you think it's all fun? Why must she have given birth to me? Is it fun? It's not a matter of fun. No one can control it. Anyway, it's not right to be a hooker! It's not fun to be a whore. She doesn't want so. After all, she's your mom. Don't talk about her like that. You don't have a family now. Your dad has left you. Your mom is the only one left. If you don't want her, no one will care about you then. Think it over. Good night. "Taoyuan Hotel" - Come on. Lend me some. - I said I don't have. You come for money all the money, I don't have so much money. - Only three hundred. - Like I said, no. - I must get back to even soon. - No. - Come on. - Hey! Stop! Give it back to me! Hey, what are you doing? - Hong. - Go away. Go away. Hey... stop! Don't beat him. No! Hong, don't. Brat, are you crazy? You hit him too hard! - Go. - You'll see, boy. Hey, cheer up! Since we met again, you look this way every time I see you. I intended to accept and help her but I got scolded. I can't explain why I'm in such bad luck. My father and mother are such kind of person. Do you think the God just likes fooling me? But I'm here too, ain't I your brother? Smile. Show me a smile. Hey, are you all right? Are you okay, miss? I told you not to ride on it. You're so careless. Get up now. Hey, why are you in a trance? Come on help her up. Miss, can you walk? My leg hurts. Do you know where she can get medical care nearby? There seems to be an aid station ahead, I don't think you can make it on your own. Sir, thank you. Another 20 bucks. Can I help you? No, thanks. Carry on. Miss, hey, miss. Crazy! Good day, sir! So it's you. Look at yourself. Hopeless. Here, you may spend it. Hong. Hong, what's the matter? - Bastard! - Hong! Hong, your father looks pretty rich now. It's his business. Not mine. Yeah, it's none of your business. But he's still your dad. My dad? You might have just seen what he did to me. He said I'm hopeless. Have he ever cared about me all these years? Is money everything? You'll find his money stinky. I'd rather die than accept it. Hong, let's work hard and make much more money. We'll buy a limo one day, 10 times better than his, agree? Let's not work here any longer. Let's work in Tsim Sha Tsui East. At least we'll not see him again. Okay? Get up. Go for lunch. Come on. Let's go. Hey, what's wrong? We're having fun. You should be happy. Why always the long face? I don't understand. Why all unhappy things always occur on me? Oh, come on. Speak it out if you got anything unhappy. My parents left me alone when I was little. I started to work since 11. Tell me. How long should I endure? Actually, I'm not much better than you. My parents died since I was little. Only my grandma brought me up. We even couldn't afford my tuition. Hey, forget it. There're many people who are more miserable than us. Try to live happily and positively. Yeah. How about we play a quiz game? Sure, go ahead. Three people come to a river. One is you. The other two fall into the river. One of them is your love, and the other is your friend. Who are you going to save? - Friend. - Love. - How about you? - Yeah. And you? I'm not telling. You cheater. Come on, tell us. Hey. Hello, hello. Tips. Hello, hello. Hello... Wow. Thank you, thank you, - Thank you. - Bye-bye. Wow. Big money! Hey, hey, so lucky! It's one hundred! One hundred! Put the money away. Hey, thank you... - Money... - Thank you. No. Don't say 'no'. Say 'yes'. Money. Yes... Stupid women! You're so mean. At least you can pay me 5 bucks. What's wrong? Who are you? I'm a Hong Kong police officer, I'm telling you. You can't beg money here. It's illegal. No. I didn't do that. You better come with me to the station. Or else I'll accuse you of obstruction of justice. Hey... let me go. Let go of me, stupid kwailo. What crime did I do? Fuck you! Now I charge you with illegal begging. Do you admit it? No, I don't. I didn't do that. I saw it with my own eyes. You have to sign here. I'm not signing I didn't do that. You wrong me. Sign it. - Asshole! - Motherfucker! Sign your name right here right now! Or else I'll accuse you of obstruction of justice. I'm not signing. You're not signing, huh? Fine! What? Hey! What are you doing? Hey, damned kwailo! Hey! Sit back and wait. Hey, come back, damned kwailo. Shut up! Sit tight. You fucking hopeless brat! Is he your son? I don't have an unworthy son like this. You lead your own unlucky life. Why must you involve me in? Rotten kid! Son of a bitch! Teach him when you're back home. Follow me to bail him out. What? Bail him out? I have no such time. I'll leave him here and let you teach him. You don't need to bail me out! You are not my father! I don't have such a father! Bastard, you're really a black sheep. You deserve to be detained in jail. I hope you to die soon, goddamned boy! They're all bastards! Hong. Calm down. I really understand what you feel now. What do you know? You got a friend beaten up until he was paralyzed? You got a girlfriend killed miserably? Those dirty assholes! Which assholes? Shitty kwailo! Shitty kwailo! Thanks to our teacher, we couldn't leave school until now. I got something to do. I gotta go. - Okay, I'll call you. - Bye... - Kitty. - What a coincidence! No, it's just I want to invite you to a movie. Do you have time? I've brought two ice-creams. Do you want one? Thank you. Oh, why are you so late? - Oh. Let's go! - Mmm. - It's Chai. - Hey, Chai! Why are you here too? Why are you here? Why are you walking so fast? You don't recognize me? - No. - No? What's that? Ice-creams. Why? Let's see a movie together. No. Chai has no time, right? Just kidding! Let's see together! Beware of the calories when you eat two at a time. - I'll share you one. - Do I have to pay? No. Be my guest. Do you think it's a good movie? They were laughing. But I don't really know why. Neither do I. Hey, I'm sending you back. I can go home myself. Let's go out together next time. Good-bye. What now? Let's go. Kitty. Don't go home tonight. Stay with me. I'd like to. But it's late now. My family is awaiting me. All right then. Go home and have a rest, will you? You too. Call me when you're home. Bye. Bye. So you're here too. We... You don't have to say. I know. Sorry. Idiot, we are brothers. Come on. Cheer up. Have some snacks. - Sure. - Let's go. Hey, don't just keep staring. Sing the song. "Happy birthday to you..." "Happy birthday to Kitty" "Happy birthday to you" - Whoa. Make a wish. - Make a wish. Blow out the candles. - What wish was it? - I won't tell you. - Yeah! - Yeah! Eat the cake. Wow, what have we got here? Hey, are you having a party? Whose birthday? Kitty's. Hey, it's my birthday too. It's mine, not yours. How can you forget? - So let's have fun together. - Yeah. What's fun? I'll tell you later. Just sit down first. - Alright. Let's go... - We'll share you the cake. - Hurry up. - Okay... Let's eat the cake. Kitty. It's for you. - I'll help you wear it. - Mmhm. Thank you. Happy birthday. - Let's sit down there. - Mmhm. - Here. It's yours. - Thank you. What's this? - Eat the cake. - Help yourselves. Let me feed you. - Eat it! - Hey, don't play with it. - Eat it! - What? Why not? Hey, cut it. Are you fooling me? Huh? Come on. Bring it on. It's fucked up already. Hey, stop it. Want some beer? I'm gonna get it. Continue when you're back. Don't play anymore... Wipe it with some tissues. - Let me wipe it for you. - Thank you. Thank you. - Come on, finger-guessing! - Once again. Five... Ten... I lost. Drink it. Chai, play it with me. I don't know how. Don't be a wet blanket drinking alone. You can drink without me. Come on. I'll play with you. Come on, Chai, I'll drink with you. Drink up! Hong. Don't drink that much. You'll get drunk. Hey hey... stop what you're doing. Today's Kitty's birthday. We're so happy. Let's give her a toast, okay? Yeah... Cheers! Drink up! We're out of beer. Chai, let's go buy some. Still some here isn't it? No. Just empty cans. Go buy some. - Now? - What's the problem? Okay... I'll put on a coat. I feel cold. - Hey... Kitty. Let's go. - Oh. Drink! Be careful. Hong... have a drink! - Don't drink too much. - Drink it up! Drink up, yeah! Chai, today is the best day in my life. Hey, don't drink that much. You'll get drunk. No problem. We are happy. Come on, Chai. Drink on! Yeah, cheers! "Life is like a dream" "Like a dream" "A friend is like a mist" "It's hard to find a soul mate through thick and thin" "treating me sincerely" "It's just you" Where's my beer? Nothing left. I'm going to buy some. I'll go with you. No. You two have a good time here. Come back soon. Hey, are you okay? I've told you not to drink so much. Check it out. See that? Let's do it. Hey, man. How's it going? What are you doing? Get away. Hong! Kitty! Bastard! Hong, help me! Hong! Go away! You go! Help! No, let her go! Hong. Come on, babe. No. No! No! Kitty! No! Help! Don't hit him... Let him go! Let's go! Chai, wake up! Chai! They killed Kitty! Do you know how tragically Kitty died? Those assholes! Assholes! Calm down. Will you calm down? Officer Kai! And this asshole too. I have to kill him! - Don't do this. - What are you doing? Don't be impetuous! - Don't fool around. - Relax! Relax! What is it? There's good stuff over there. - Go to harass them. - It'll be fun. One, two, three! What the hell is going on? What are you people? What are you doing? Oh no, let him go! Let him go! Help! Help! - Stop! Stop! - No more. Stop! Help! Stop where you are! Stop! No! No! - Very bouncy. - No! No! No! Shong, Blondie, put her on the table. Sure! Oh, Benny. Benny, help me! Want to escape? She's escaping. Goddamned fucker! You bastard! Bloody kwailo, damned kwailo! Are you crazy? Are you gonna kill him? - Bloddy kwailo! - Hong, sit back and don't fuck up. Sit back! Stupid kwailo. Sit back! Watch him over! Go away, it's my turn. Why is it you every time? - How about us? - Give me a hand now! Almost there. Soon you'll be the next. No! No! No. No... Tracey... Bloody kwailo, bloody kwailo! Trying to get away, asshole? Get away then! Get away then! Go away! Go! - Go! - No! Go! No! - It's my turn, get off! - What's up? Hong! - Go! Do you want to kill her? - Fuck off! Hong, spare her life! Hong, don't do that! Get away from me! Go, bitch! Go away! Go! Please let me go! No! Go! Keung, what's wrong with Hong? Calm down, calm down! - I gotta go! - Calm down! He's still hitting her! No, hold him back! Go! Hong, stop! What shall we do? Throw her off the hill! Now! Let's go. You killed her, you know that? Let's go! Move! Hong! - Get out of here! - Move! Keung, is it safe here? Don't worry. Stop walking to and fro. Now that I've brought you here, don't be afraid. Look, it's a remote place here. How could the cops be able to find us? Sit tight. I'm going inside and talk with my uncle to see if there's any solution. Sit tight, will you? Don't go about. It's all your fault. What seized you? You killed two at a fit. Now you got us in trouble. You bet. What a jinx! What are you talking about? Did I say anything wrong? What do you want now? What are you arguing for? He hit me first. I must fight back. No fighting! - Stop! Stop! - He hit me first. Sit down. Save your energy to make money. Money? Where can we make money? I surely have my own way. Behold carefully. The banker wins. Come on, put down your stakes. Gentlemen, come in and play a couple of rounds. Try some luck. - Come in. - Gentlemen, this way. Gentlemen, come on in. How about you two playing here? Enjoy yourself. Enjoy the game. - Who's beer? - Right here. Coming! Is it fun? - Here you are. - Thanks a lot. Win more! Someone knows me here. Where? Shut up, find Keung and get out of here. Okay... Brat, you want to make money here? Look at you, how much money have you brought with you? You got it from your mom? If you have money, give me some. At worst we're sort of father and son. You two want to rob? What's wrong? Robbery! Get down now! Stay down. Give us all your money! Give us all! Do you really like to play with me? Let's play till you die, okay? Take off your watch. Come on... Done? Do it quick! Take off your bracelet! Give me your necklace! And your wallet! Now! Come on! Bastard! Asshole! Bastard! Bastard! This way! Stop right there! Blondie, you go first with him. Take care of the money bag. Go! Relax. - Be gentle. - It's okay. - It hurts like hell. - It's okay. You fucking idiot, how could drop a knife like that? I'm telling you. Unless Shong's leg is okay, you have to die in front of me. He stumbled and fell over too. Don't put all blames on me. Shut up. So we can't leave Hong Kong now. Don't know where Hong is now, either. I don't want to see you. Get out! Do you think I want it? Shong is also my brother. We don't need a brother like you. You compromised us. It's all my fault. I brought you this shit. Okay. I'll leave! Leave? Not that easy! You can't go until this case is settled. So what do you want from me. I can't go, while I can't stay. You don't talk back. Don't push me. Fire if you have guts! Don't push me. Keung, I don't want to. You really fired, bastard! Don't push me! - Stop! Bastard! - Let him go! Breaking news. The police is pursuing several men at the age of between 16 to 20 who are suspected to be involved in an armed robbery and the rape case on Braemar Hill. Anyone who knows their position please contact the police immediately. - Stop. - What's wrong? CID. What's the matter, sir? You look dirty. Where's your ID? Show it to me. No. - Freeze! - Freeze! - You can't get away. - Take him back. Go! Boy, were you in the case in King's Park? Tell me. Telling or not? It's none of my business. So whose business then? It's true. It's none of my business. Who did it? I wasn't involved. You weren't? So why are you so scared? It's none of my business. My buddies forced me to. Where are your buddies now? I don't know where they are. - You don't know? - I really don't know. Tell me now! I really don't know. So you're not telling? I'm telling you. There's plenty of proof here. Do you know this one? No. No? How about this one? I said no. You must know this one. If you refuse to tell, you'll take all the counts. Sir, give me a chance. I'll confess. Who? Who is it? Ngau, open the door. It's me. So it's you, Hong. Where have you been? Don't talk here. Come on. Cops are searching us everywhere. Where's Blondie? That brat went away alone. By the way, would this bastard go and tell on us? I dare him! I don't think he'll tell on us. I'm just afraid he'll get caught by cops. I have a bad feeling about this. Let's get out of here tomorrow morning. Sure. Hong, you must be tired. Wash your face and go to bed. It's the police. Let's go. - Stop... - Freeze! Stop! Stop! Stop right there! The other way! - Follow me. - Okay. Let's split. - You go that way. - Okay. - Don't run! - Stop! Stop running! Stop! Or I will shoot! Wai, cuff him! Put your hands on your head. Don't you move, or I'll shoot him. Boy, calm down. Let my colleague go. Do you hear me? Get up! Put your gun down... now! Hurry up! Brat, you still wanna go? Get up! Bring him back. Go! Keung, how do you feel? Ngau, leave me alone. Go! Let's go together! - Go! Go! - Keung! Let me! Don't move! Don't move! Help.. Let the woman go! Shut up! Put the gun down. Hey! Don't mess with that kid! He's innocent. I said put the gun down! Do it! Stay down. Give my kid back to me. Hey, you okay? Are you all right? Take them to somewhere safe. Don't you move. Move, Move it. Stand up! - Cuff him! - Yes, Sir. Stand up. - Still wanna run? - No. Move, move your ass.
