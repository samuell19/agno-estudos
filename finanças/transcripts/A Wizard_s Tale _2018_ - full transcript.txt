Subtitles by explosiveskull What you're looking at here is that most peculiar of places, Groovingham. If you can't imagine it, well, it's probably here too. It's a world populated by all kinds of... Look, it's probably better if you just see it for yourself. I'm sure he's fine. See you later, suckers! Get him! He's getting away! This is where our story starts, the "Once Upon a Time." And a young wizard was arriving in Groovingham with his true love, Mary. Ah! Here comes the Grin! Here comes the Grin! Mwah! Bye! Oh, here comes the Grin! Here comes the Grin! Here comes the Grin! Here comes the Grin! Here comes the Grin! Here comes the Grin! Here comes the Grin! Here comes the Grin! Here comes the Grin! Time to faint. Ooh! He was top of his class at wizard school, so of course everyone wanted to see him on his very first day as king's wizard. The greatest wizard in the world! A hero to us boys and girls! A new taxpayer! But of everyone, the Grin was the most excited. Here comes the Grin. Finally, he was going to make his dream come true. He would make everybody and everything... happy. Come on, come on, come on, come on! He's got the grin! And there's plenty to go around! I want the grin! ♪ Come on, grin ♪ ♪ Hang your coats ♪ ♪ Eat our chips, come on ♪ ♪ He's gotta know ♪ ♪ Shake your coconuts ♪ I want the grin! - I want the grin! - I want the grin! I want the grin! Wait! Reporting for work, Your Highness. I've made a good start already. If you look outside, it's... Total chaos, Sire! The realm's aflame! Hello. Does anyone fancy some tax refunds? All it takes is a "please." - Please? - Close enough. Whoo-hoo! Not only am I happy, I'm also rich! Mmmph! This... is... chaos! Chaos isn't so vile if you face it with a smile! Capture him! Help! Mwah! Jump! Ohh! Whoa! Get in. Take the pepper! Ah-choo! Ah-choo! They spent days hidden amongst the caves. I totally understand you want to make everyone happy, but you can't force it. I'm just trying to cheer everyone up, whether they like it or not. People have to find happiness themselves. You don't understand. Oh! Look! Ah-choo! I'll get some supplies. Don't worry. I'll make this little fella happy too. You'll see. We'll talk later, okay? But she never came back. The king accused her of helping the Grin and banished her forever. She was sent through a portal to our dimension, never to see her love again. Nooo! And she could never return to her world. She's not coming back, Dingo. She's left me. Grandma, I wish they stayed happily ever after. Oh, me too, Terry. It would have been wonderful. Why didn't you write it that way? Well, in real life, things don't always turn out happily ever after. Grandma, what happened to the Grin? I'm sure he's still the cheerful fellow he always was. Now go to sleep. Quickly, chop-chop. She's left me. Ah... choo! Wait! Whoa! Whoa! Try opening your eyes this time. Chop-chop! Chop-chop! What do you mean, you don't have change? I'm sorry. We had one customer today, and he paid with a twenty. Daddy, why couldn't we go somewhere with a real roller coaster? Hey! We've got a real classic roller coaster right here! Oh, come on, darling. This place! Didn't want to come here anyway. Three hours in the car! Yeah, kid. This place is a dump. And your ice cream sucks! Look, I know you already have your hands full, but we need to think about updating. Amusement parks are, well, more amusing these days. And exciting. What? The park is exciting. Really exciting. It's just the way Grandma left it. You can't always keep things exactly as they were in your grandma's day. Oh, lovely! Hey, put that down! That was Grandma's last-ever cup of coffee! And she left it in this exact spot. I know this is hard, but if we miss another payment, we'll have to close. We can't close! Oh, Terry, you either need to move forward here or go back home to your parents. It's time to face reality. Hmm. What? Strange. Oh. Oh, come on! Chop-chop! Huh? Huh? What is this? Okay, I just need to land this thing gently. Good enough. What? A dragon! That was a living, breathing dragon! And it wrote me a speeding ticket. Huh? A castle? And a chocolate mine. It's just like Grandma's park, only realer. And don't forget the candy frost cemetery. Oh, thank you. Heh heh heh. I say! What a nice young man! Okay, that's it. I've got to get back home immediately. Oh, dreadful weather! Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Sweet freedom! Ow! Where's the boss? You've lost him! He doesn't need us anymore. He's abandoned us! Don't be absurd. Who would ever abandon me? Finally! After decades! The king will feel all the might of my revenge. What? "In loving memory?" How dare he kick the bucket without telling me! Boss, where are you? You've squished him! The king is dead. Bang goes my revenge. Princess Dawn's coronation. Huh? Princess? As in the king's daughter? I don't know, Boss. Of course she is, you halfwit. Where is my dragon? Dingo! Stop. Your breath. All right, that's enough! Dingo, Grumpies, we have work to do. Ooh! But first, I need a bath and a shave. We're going to a coronation! Sound the alarm! It's a beautiful day here in Groovingham, and everyone is anxiously waiting for Princess Dawn to appear for her coronation. But I don't even know if I want to be queen just by myself. Truth be told, I think I'd rather sit here and wait for my Prince Charming to come. You have come of age. It is mandatory that you succeed your father on the throne. Plus look at the pretty crown, dear. Oh, my little girl... now a full-grown woman! Blow your nose, darling. But I don't want to do any of this! What is it, Bip? Grump escape from big prison. Grump coming! The Grump? I thought he was just a boogeyman in old stories, told to make me eat my soup. You never wanted to finish your soup. Actually, he is very real, I'm afraid. And the last wizard in Groovingham. Oh, my! It took your father so many years to capture him. Here comes the Grump. Here comes the Grump. Here comes the Grump. Here comes the Grump. It's going get grumpy in here! Who is it? Wizard Grump, you are not welcome. Please go! Oh, really? Hmm. Now, I've heard that that inconsiderate king of yours died before I could say my special goodbye to him. Good to know he left his daughter to pay for his selfish actions. I once offered happiness to this kingdom, but you rejected it! So I'm the Grump now, and I want to show you my gratitude by giving you gloom! Oh, Bip! Whoo-hoo! Cut the racket, you dumb buffoon. Get down, get funky on my spell of gloom! Princess not safe. Me take to magic panic room. What? Oh, not again. This is the third time I've landed here. This is insane. I just want to go home! Why won't you work? What am I doing differently? Oh, my dear child, cover your ears and sing 500 times the lullaby of the little sun. Nanny, do you know what an evil spell over my kingdom means? Don't say it. My prince is coming to save me! Would this be a bad time to say I may have oversold the whole prince thing? Come out! Come out wherever you are! Just in case the prince is late for some reason, remember to go to the Oracle. ♪ Oh, it is sunny ♪ ♪ And it puts warmth in my tummy ♪ ♪ When that big fat yellow ball ♪ ♪ Makes my troubles, oh, so small ♪ Hey, little detachable thing. Oh, sorry, chum. I can't come with you. You! Wait! Give me that back! Wait! Listen to the misery, Dingo. Oh, is it not beautiful? Inspiring, hmm? Unhappy makes me happy! Boss! Boss! Oh, bad news, Boss! The Princess escaped the gloom! Hah! That little thorn in my side must be plucked out! But the good news is we know where she is. Well, why didn't you say it, hmm? Hey, stop! I need that thing to get back home! Get back here! Stop. Nobody goes in. How come you never speak to me that nicely? Sorry. Hey, you! Give me that! Mmm. Delicious. Hey, come back! Tweet, tweet, blooming tweet. Hey, would you like any help crossing the street? Thank you very much. My pleasure. Welcome to Groovingham! Have a nice day! Welcome to Groovingham! Have a nice day! At least someone here is happy. I hate my work and my life! Hey, come back here, nose thing! Hey! Stop! Give that back! Greetings! I was wondering, how will my prince find me when I'm hiding down there? Should I not be lying upon the bed? Bip! Hey, get back here! You're here! I'm falling! Who are you? I'm Dawn. I'm your princess, and we'll be living happily ever after together. - And you are? - Uh, Terry. Prince Terry! No, just Terry-Terry. Oh. Listen, I need to get back home. But you can't leave. We... We need you. You are a prince, aren't you, Terry-Terry? I'm not. - Say you are. - But I'm not. Please say you are! Okay. I'm a prince. I knew it! Excuse me, can you help me? - Also not a prince. - Let's just say... there comes a time in the life of every princess when she faces a great crisis. A sleeping spell or in this precise instance, a spell of gloom. And when that time comes, her prince will come to her rescue. Who told you this? - My teddy bear. - Your teddy bear said this? It's a bit more like she sings to me, sweet airs and lullabies. But yes, basically that's it. Come! We must find Chancellor Woodblock! Yeah, Chancellor Woodblock, obviously. Didn't you see the sign, you bozo? Ohh! Guess I'd better slide down the wall. Whoo! So how come you're not gloomy? I hid under the bed. Whenever there is a crisis, that is what one does. Um, so would my royal princeness-ness carry weight on someone, say, assisting me on going back home? - Of course it would. - Awesome. As soon as you save my kingdom, and we get married. Uh, married? What is this, Vegas? Look! My faithful subjects safe and sound. Hmmph! Chancellor Woodblock? Nanny? Don't "Chancellor Woodblock" and "Nanny" us! We can't bear you anymore. That's funny because you are a bear, and you said "bear" you. - Okay. - They've all been gloomed. It's not that. You treat us like servants! Have you all taken leave of your senses? You are my servants. - Oh, how dare she! - Don't push it, my girl! Come on, you Grumpies! Pull! Pull! Wait, wait, I know that guy. That's the Grin, isn't it? That was his name, but after things went bad for him, he changed it to the Grump. Much more classy. But why? Hmm. Okay, listen, Princess, I need to find my way back home. That's right! Chancellor Woodblock told me to go to the Oracle. You can come with me. He'll know what to do. Oh, so you were listening after all. Okay, how do we get there? Do you have a map? I think we have a map room. You'll have to remind me where that is. - It's a rather large castle. - I don't know. - Chancellor, please! - Sorry. Apparently I've completely taken leave of my senses. So no one will help me? Fine! I'm resourceful, am I not? You're good at doing things for yourself. Oh, so that's what "resourceful" means. Then no, I'm not. Come on, we've got to get out of here. These people are crazy. Careful, you good-for-nothing twerp. A dragon is a delicate thing. Dingo. Okay, attack. Fan out. Let's move. Move, move, move, move! So where is that map room? One needs a map to find the map room in this place. This is the carousel room. A plastic balls room? Howling wind room. Get them! Is this customary in your kingdom? Well, one needs evildoers to be rescued from. Now do your thing, brave prince. Okay. Run! Whee! Clapping monkey room? Why do you even have a clapping monkey room, baby? It is a truth universally acknowledged that every house is in need of a clapping monkey room. Or else, where would one put one's clapping monkeys? - I knew that. - Look! Mm-hmm. Nice, huh? No! I mean the mood dart. What does this one do? Well, it didn't do anything to me, babe. Now move aside while I use my out-of-this-world strength to protect you. Oh, no. It's an ego dart. You've been very self-important. Well, I think you'll find myself is very important. Sorry, shorties, your mood darts don't affect me. Oops! Sorry. No, it's fine. It didn't hurt. Hey, no touching the merchandise, baby. How do I look in this dress? Oh no. Don't tell me there's an insecure-girlfriend dart. Hold on. I didn't know we had a male-chauvinist-pig dart. Nope. That's just you. When are you going to stop running and start fighting those things? Me? It's you they're after. Hang on. Blame darts. I knew it. Oh, sure. Of course you know everything. Oh. The map room. Where? Oh. Hello there. What can I do for you? We're looking for a map to the Oracle. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm only a map for finding the map room. But we're already in the map room. Then my work here is done. Uh, thank you? ♪ I'm the map, I'm the map, I'm the map ♪ Oh, definitely not that one. Hey. Hey. Hey! Hey! Oh! Yeah. Nothing. Aaargh! Aww! All right, guvnors, how can I help ya? Didn't hear ya there, me ol' China Plate. "China Plate" means "mate." Don't tell me you ain't never heard no Cockney-rhyming slang before. I don't Adam and Eve it. Here comes the Grump! Run! Come on! Move, fools! Search for them! Ah, it's him. The Grin... I mean the Grump. Pssst. Help me. Now! Push! Oh. Run! Look out, mates! Unlike the darts, a spell cast from a wizard will be permanent. Permanent? Is there another way out? Yeah, hang on, give me a second. Please pull up your vehicle. The heck with it! Just dive through that door on the ground! Hmm? What the... After you. Stop shooting! Stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop it! Right, let's get out of here. Okay, where ya headed, me ol' chinas? Well, we still need the right map. A map? I'm a top-of-the-range, state-of-the-art navigation assistant. GP Sparrow's the name. GPS for short. Good for you, but can you take us to the Oracle? Yes, little lady. I'm your man. This way. Dawn must go! There is no need to be rude. I haven't started to rule yet. It's a spell. It'll get worse and worse every day. - Worse? How? - We don't want a princess. Go away. Much worse than a tomato. My blimp will get us to the Oracle faster. The sooner we get there, the sooner I'll be back home. But you can't leave after that. Who will protect me? I'm sorry. I have responsibilities, a job. And seriously, Dawn, do I look like a prince? You certainly don't smell like one. Ah-choo! Can you stop that? I've got to go home and save my grandma's amusement park. Amusement park? Does it tell jokes? No, although the profits are pretty laughable. And if it's that bad, why would you want to go back? It's not that it's bad. I haven't found a way to make it as cool as my grandma made it. Come on. And he's a family man too. Everyone, hop in. You have arrived at your destination. Uh, where? The Oracle. Ta-da! And we're gonna ask this Oracle questions, and it's going to answer us, right? Right. Greetings! We're here! Oracle! Uh-huh, sure, whatever. I mean, you know, fine. Wow. Thou have reached the all-seeing Oracle! Name your business with me, puny mortals. Oh! You tell me. You are the Oracle. Oh, come on, we need a little drama here. It's kind of getting boring, sitting around all day. You have come in search of my help! Talk about a cut-priced Oracle. Anyone could have guessed that. Anyone could have guessed that! Well, how about I know the Grump has cast a spell over your kingdom. Ah, big deal. I also know that thing with your underwear, Terry. - What thing with his... - Nothing! It was an accident! Never mind. Guy's awesome! He even... Guessed my name. Who's a cut-price Oracle now, huh? Wow! I take it back. That's... Amazing! I can't believe... - How dumb I look now? - Wait. No, I wasn't going... To say that. Stop it. No, you stop it. Gentlemen, settle down. Sorry, my dear. You must travel to the Cave of the Whispering Orchids. I didn't know of such a place. And that, Princess, is why I'm the all-knowing one. Find the Crystal Key. It is the only way to lift the spell. So she needs to find the key. Yeah, so do you. You need that key to go back home. Oh, goodie! We're both on a quest for the same thing. We have much in common, key buddy. How can the key be the thing that helps both of us? Because that key is the key... to happiness. - But... - Well! Now we all know what we're looking for. Of course, when I find the key, I'm going to destroy it. Sorry. Get her! And the boyfriend too. I'm not her boyfriend. That's what everyone says at the beginning. Oh, that was a wink, by the way. She'll leave you, you know. Not in a million lifetimes. Fry them, Dingo. Stone the crows! What, you couldn't see that coming? I told you, I get bored a lot. Run! At last, a bit of excitement. Quick, give me the vial of perfume. Good idea, my prince. At least we'll be sweet-smelling corpses. Run! Help me! Hey! Whoa! That zeppelin. Where did he get my blimp? Ah... Ah... Don't do it. Don't do it. Hold that sneeze, lizard lips! Ah-choo! We just need to patch it. I don't suppose you have any rubber trees. No, but I do know the closest drum. That's drum and bass place for a patch. - The Balloony Woonie Kingdom. - What's that? A kingdom inhabited by balloons. I bet there's a patch there. - On we go then, gentlemen. - Uh, detour. Recalculating, recalculating. But first, I decree we make a small camp. If one does not rest soon, it might ruin the royal complexion. Yeah, I do feel a bit drowsy. I didn't bring my special sleeping pillow. I'll have to improvise. Now, Prince Terry, it's time for my bedtime story. You may begin. Really? I don't think so. Okay, okay. Uh... Once upon a time, there was a... - A prince? - No, a... a lemur. - A lemur prince? - No, just a lemur. And this lemur, well, he lived with his granny lemur in the kingdom of Real-worldia. Is she beautiful? Yeah, yeah, the most beautiful granny ever. And she had built this incredible place, where kids... lemurs... would have tons of fun. And she told her grandson stories about this world of yours. And the lemur and his granny lived... Lived happily ever after. I hate to burst your princess bubble, but... "happily ever after" doesn't really exist in reality. In Real-worldia? Not in Real-worldia, nor in life. Life doesn't have happy endings. Life is full of happy endings, Prince Terry. You just need to know where to look for them. Your destination is 300 feet ahead. My grandma told me stories about this kingdom. Brave red balloons defend the castle, using spears, shields, swords, and... musical instruments? Go tell your king that Princess Dawn is here and wishes to speak to him. No. There's no kings here, sister. Kings are like so mainstream, sister dude. Go ahead, everyone's welcome. Oh. Very well then. Announce our arrival, if you please. Her Most Gracious Highness, Princess Dawn and her... buffoon have arrived. What? What have they done to the castle? It's a cafe. Hello, I'm Thelonius! What are you having today, man? We have oxygen, water, oxygen-oxygen macchiato, fat-free deoxygenated oxygen. May I suggest the air of the month? Thank you. We really don't want any... What sizes do you serve? There's molto grandotto, enormissimo, and big. Which is the small one? No small here. Just molto grandotto. Actually, we're not having anything, thank you. We're in a bit of a hurry. Hurrying is wrong, man. Slow down. Take a sip. Love the ironic outfit, mate. Look, we're in a really critical situation, right, Princess? Princess? No more Princess Dawn. Call me Princess Up. What have you given her? Since she's royalty, I've added two complementary extra caffeinated oxygen shots to her serving. Aha! Can I have some? No, you can't. She is completely looney. We call it happiccino. Hey! Beep. Beep. Bip. Aah! Who's in charge here? We're all masters of our own destiny here. Hey! Listen, we just need to find a patch and get out of here. I've just had a lot of some handmade patches from an indigenous organic patch farm delivered. GP, please! What? I was doing nothing. Here comes the Grump! What do we do? He found us. I love organic food. Battle stations, everyone! Ho! What are you... What are you doing? We'll crush them under the might of our nonconformist posts. What in the name of wickedness are those guys doing, huh? Oh, no! They're posting horrible comments about you, sir. Our popularity will be crushed. How dare they. I'll show them. Fire at will! Increase the sourness of your comments. Feel the wrath of our weapon! Look out! I hate the poop one. Look out! YOLO! Really? You can use that old machine to patch your blimp. Come on. Let's help them first. Patch. Air. Give me that. Clear. Patch the wounded! Get them, Dingo! Hold it! Ohh! Ow! Ooh! Ooh! Everyone, grab a tank and charge! Chop-chop! No! Not our season blend! There goes my prince, saving me again. I'm so proud. Everyone, give me a T. - Uh... - T!

Special happiccino order for Mr. GP Sparrow. Uh, must be some other GP Sparrow, I guess. Wave that smile bye-bye 'cause this spell will make you cry! Give me my blimp back! His blimp back? What? Princess! She's been struck by the spell. Are you okay? You will leave me. You will. - Oh, woe is me. - What? You will find a younger princess with bigger diamonds in her crown and more drama! We need specialist's help. She's losing it. Searching. Found one alchemist in the area. Head towards the... - Oh, no. - What? The only way to get there is incredibly dangerous, through the Christmas Tree Forest. Let's go. We have no time. She's about to get worse. Worse is good. Happy is for conformists. Nice weather, eh, Princess? Quiet. They might hear ya. Who? Recalculating detour. Princess! Bip! Are you okay? Bip! Come here, boy! Bip! My pretty little puppy, lost forever. No, if he were lost, he wouldn't be barking. Uh, he's not barking anymore. Bip! Hello? And Yuletide greetings to one and all. Oh, no. Is it that time of year already? Here is always the most wonderful time of the year. And you are all invited to spend Christmas with us forever. Thank you very much, but we can't stay. We're on a mission. Such a shame. Looks like you're going to be part of our Christmas ornaments, just like your friends here. Grump? Princess, on the count of three, try swinging, okay? One, two... three. What are they doing to him? Some kind of pastry arrangement? Oh, no! I think it's figgy pudding. We've got to stop them. No, wait! Finally! Our Christmas quest has come to an end. Quest? Christmas quest? Yes! Don't you see? That's old Saint Nick with his elves. Is it? Really? We are brave kids on a quest to, uh... Give Rudolph his nose back. Give Rudolph his nose back. Exactly. And save Christmas. Bip, give Rudolph his nose back. That sounds convincingly similar to a Christmas TV special. Release them fast! They have to save Christmas! How did we miss it?

I left my purse back at the castle, and I want new shoes. You have arrived at your final destination. You mean at death? Yeah, I'm processing all this, and it feels like she's suffering from being... sad. She's sad? That's your diagnosis, is it? She's sad? My official diagnosis is she's very sad. Oh, no! I'm very sad. And a little insipid too, I might add. And I'm insipid too! Well, that's all I can diagnose right now. Mrs. Milverton, please offer our guests some, uh... tea. - Is this how you do psychology? - It's alchemy. Psychology ain't an exact science. Alchemy is. Yes, no, well, that certainly looks precise, I guess. Yes, I know what needs to be done. I need a hug. Okay. Come here, you. You need to find a wizard. Only a wizard can remove a magic spell. But Grump is the only wizard left, isn't he? Oh. Of course, there is the age-old, ever-reliable true love's first kiss. Well, then I'm doomed because nobody loves me. Nobody! Oh, no, don't say that. Bip loves you. Isn't there another way? It's either a wizard or the you-know-what, tiger. - Grrrr! - What? No! No! You don't understand. I'm not in love with the princess. I heard that. Why don't you give it a shot? Go on. But this is nonsense. So a true love's first kiss it is. It should be administered as the sun rises and not a minute later. Call me in the morning. Here. Told ya. Alchemy is the best. - Dawn. - Yes, Terry-Terry? No, I mean, it's dawn already. The kiss, remember? Oh, the kiss. Oh, okay, just give me a second here. You want directions to her lips? I know where they are. Hurry up then, guvnor. Dawn's not gonna last forever and neither is Dawn. Give us some room then. Chop-chop. That was... amazing! It was? I'm cured. But somehow I thought... a true love's first kiss would be more epic. Whoa! What do you mean? It's almost as if... and I know it's probably not possible... but "happily ever after" doesn't happen just because of a kiss. Well, happily ever after doesn't depend on just a kiss. And to be honest, I don't know how my kiss broke your spell because, well, I'm... You're not in love with me. Please! We've only known each other for a day. People don't fall in love in a day. It's just, well, relationships are hard. They take work. I don't understand why you can't believe in "happily ever after," and why I'm so hard to fall in love with. Oh, don't say that, Dawn. Hey, don't be mad at me. All I wanted was to get back home. Then so be it! But... I'll sit here and perhaps my true prince will come. Dismissed, all of you. You've reached your destination. Well, it is a cave, and I do hear whispers. Stop. Only wizards are allowed inside our cave. Only wizards are allowed inside our cave. Only wizards are allowed inside our cave. I swear, if they ever get to that cave... Get him! - Oh, hi. - Hello. - Put 'em up, put 'em up! - Ah, ah, ah... Ah-choo! This spell is a sleepy jinx. Close your eyes to get 40 winks. Let us go and get that key. The princess can wait. Oh, don't worry, lad. I'll find ya. Volunteer for going inside? Brave volunteer stepping up. Stop. Only wizards are allowed inside our cave. Well! Only wizards? There I was, worrying about those dumb kids. Oh! I am the only wizard left. Orchids, I am the Grump. Ah! Welcome to the Cave of Whispering Orchids. ♪ When, oh, when will my prince arrive ♪ ♪ A dream of love that could come true ♪ ♪ I'll sit and wait for my prince ♪ ♪ My prince of blue ♪ ♪ Called Stu ♪ ♪ Who likes me even though I'm cuckoo ♪ Bip! Well, Bip's nose anyway. Ah, the rest of Bip. Well, I've been embroidering as I await my true prince, see? He found the cave? Well, good for him. The Grump did what? Oh, my! Terry! That stubborn boy needs us. But how will we get there in time? To the rescue, whatever your name is. Oh, my fair princess! At last I have found thee. - Kingdoms... - Yeah, whatever. Tell me later. I've got to go rescue someone. Huh? Where am I? You're safe now. Ooh. Wait. Weren't you under my gloomy spell? Hmm. And you. You were under my sleepy spell. Oh, give me a break. And that key, it wasn't inside that blasted cave. You! You took it. Me? I couldn't have taken it. Didn't the orchids tell you? Only a wizard can get inside the cave. Hmm. So they did. What? Only wizards? We're doomed, Terry-Terry. That's what the orchids said. But maybe the orchids can be a little melodramatic. I will guard this key with my life. Or I'll just run away with it, if it's easier. Dingo, stop! Tie them all up and go and get my blimp back. Turn left two centimeters. In approximately three millimeters, turn right. Come on. Dawn must go! Dawn must go! Dawn must go! So how did you get that key? I don't know. The orchids just let me in. Maybe I could be a wizard too. No, think about it. Orchids, the kiss, the rabbit... - What rabbit? - My blimp being Grump's blimp. My grandma being all alone. Okay, but how do you cast spells then? Well, I mean, obviously, it's... Abracadabra! Hocus pocus. Grump is gonna destroy the key. We need to think of something fast. We need to hurry up! Chop-chop! Say that again. Chop-chop? Huh? Keys, chop-chop. Oops. Bip's nose! And the keys. Oh, well done, Bip. Looks like your magic isn't necessary this time. Dawn must go! Dawn must go! Dawn must go! Dawn must go! Let's put an end to happiness. Terry, be careful! I'm a wizard. I can do this. Chop-chop! Thank you, you fool. Maybe not. Dawn must go! Chop-chop. Uh-oh. The key. It's broken. Well, I think we did quite well. Almost saved my kingdom and almost sent you back home. Yeah, we came close. And it sorta seems as though you were right. Perhaps I don't need a prince to save me after all. And you don't need the key to go back home. - Huh? - There's your blimp! Use your magic and say, "Chop-chop!" It's dangerous. Come with me. I am the queen. I must stay. Dawn must go! Dawn must go! Dawn must go! Dawn must go! Dawn must go! Dawn must go! I'll stay here with you. Hooray! What happened? We found happiness. It only works when you're ready to let it go. Nooo! You! Get him! That's... A young man. Oh. Mary. Ohh... My Grandma Mary, your girl, she could never return to your world, so she built this park as a way to remember you. Oh, Mary. I only wanted to make everyone happy. We still can. Grandpa. Two minutes to the final show! Just two minutes! It meant a lot that you could come. I'd like you to meet my parents. Dad, this is Dawn. Oh, charmed. Oh, hello. Where's Mum? Jocelyn, honey? Oh! Hello. Oh! Nice meeting you. Oh, and you must be Terry's fiancé. No, um... It's a little too early for that. We've only known each other a month. Can I, uh... Of course. Well, we love what you did to the park here. See you later. Come on, Malcolm. How's everything going back home? People are very happy with the changes I've suggested. Me like pay when me works. And soon we'll be having grammar classes for everyone too. Oh, no! Here comes the Grump! You blasted kids, I'll get you all! Dingo, attack! Ha ha! This is the best amusement park ever! Whoo! Waah! Oh, chop-chop. Ah, first month of the reopening, and we've already paid off all our debts. Not bad, Terry, not bad. Thanks, and not bad for the ol' Grump either. Whoa!
