There are early indications for all symptoms. Must find that indication and take proper action before it becomes too big. Is it serious? I'm not telling you because it's serious, just pay attention to your kid sometime. Has Juhee suffered from atopic dermatitis before? No, never. Did you just move recently? Yes. To an old apartment complex, right? No, it's a new residential office complex. These red marks are from asbestos. Worry about her respiratory system, not only her skin. If asbestos gets into her lung, then it'll be fatal. Is that a new house syndrome or something? Yes, the problem with living environment. Strange though, newer buildings mostly won't have any asbestos... Anyhow, I will give you the prescription for her Apply the ointment constantly and, most importantly, ventilate well. Hello? - Chae Min-young? - Hello, chief Why aren't you at work yet? Didn't Mr. Ha tell you? I'm at the hospital with my sick child. Min-young, you know how many cases have immediate deadlines. Yes, of course. I was gonna stop by the office later. It's not just one or two You know they must be finished by tonight, right? Yes, sir. And you know how important they are? Yes. - Please pay attention, - Yes. - I'm counting on you, Min-young - Yes, I'm truly sorry. Are you going to work? Yes, dear. Mommy's coming back right away. Do repair work? What for? My child has atopic dermatitis. Not one place will do repair work for a simple atopic symptom! A simple atopic symptom? She's really suffering from a symptom she never had before. And it's all due to asbestos! Why are you mad at me for? Also, nobody uses asbestos for construction these days. It's an illegal material. Our complex is supposed to be environment-friendly building. 1, 2, 3, 5th floor. Oops! I'm sorry. - Ms. Chae Min-young. - Yes? Don't bring any personal related-stuff to your workplace. I'm terribly sorry. Juhee, mommy's home. Why are all the lights off? I didn't do it. Aren't you afraid of the dark? No, I'm always alone anyway. What are all these? Juhee. Juhee, what did you do? I didn't do it. Then who did? Juhee, you shouldn't lie to mommy. I know you are upset with me but this makes it so much harder for mommy. I told you I didn't do it. Juhee, that's too much. Let's stay at Sanghee's place for a while. No! I will never leave this place. Who is it? Who is it this late at night? I told you to keep quiet. Huh? I told you to keep quiet here. Why are you making noises then? Made noises? I told you, didn't I? Told you not to make noises. Guess you don't take my kind warnings seriously. Make noises? We were sleeping just now! Even if we made any noises isn't it rude to behave this way in the middle of the night? Rude behavior? I don't know the meaning of it. Anyhow, keep quiet or next time I won't be so kind! Juhee. Let's eat. Juhee. Juhee, what are you doing? Where did you get this? Where did you get this, huh? It was here. Why are you lying? Where did you get this? It was really here. What's wrong with you these days? It was really here! Hello! Shoot! Is anybody home? Excuse me... Can you come out for a second? Come on, get out of the way. What is it this time? Huh? We are not sure yet. What the fuck! Gotta perform exorcism or something. Hey, detective Park. Hi, how are you? What happened? Well, I think it was a drug overdose, with needles and all. A drug addict? All kinds of death here. So what happens now? Well, although it's not a murder case... since narcotics are involved... Detective Park, can't you take care of this quietly? Sorry, but I can't really say. I understand Guess I'll have to talk to Captain Heo. - Okay, then. - Detective Park. - Huh? - The witness says... ...she saw a woman and a boy. Are you sure? Yes. Shoot, this makes it complicated. What did he say? There was a woman and a boy living in this place. But they are not here. We must investigate any cases involving both death and missing persons. Have you had a conversation with the woman? We never talked, but I once got lost after the company dinner and saw her then. A company dinner, huh? You must've had some alcohol, right? Yes, just a little. Got drunk and got off on the wrong floor? I drank but I wasn't intoxicated. You sure it was this third floor? Yes, I'm sure. Have you ever witnessed the woman and a boy living there in person, while not intoxicated? I'm absolutely sure about it Also the noise from downstairs. - My daughter... - Get your acts together lady! The person living at 304 was single. What the hell are you talking about. Sir, please calm down. Your daughter is the only kid living in this building. Checked the entire room, no sign of him living with a woman and a boy whatsoever. Detective Park, do you believe her? Don't start things up. Come on lady. You can't come in here. Get out now! Juhee, mommy told you not to do that. You don't even listen to mommy! I hate you! You're ugly! You stupid idiot! I will stab and kill you I will never like you again. Hello, sis? It's me, Min-young. Juhee, let's go to Sanghee's house. No! We shouldn't be here, so let go. I'm staying in this house. Come on, get up. - Get up now! - I'm not leaving here! Get up No, I don't want to. What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way? You're the only one for me. Please do as I say! Get up. - No. - Get up and let's go. No, I don't want to. Step outside, Juhee. Come on out! Hi, princess. Where are you going with mommy? It's the weekend so we're going for a walk I'm not coming out. Oh no... Why is our princess so mad? Can I get you an ice cream? Forget it. Juhee! I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. So I will see you next time then. Get lost! One of you did something... Sorry, sis, but just for few days... Don't worry. My husband always gets home late so there's nothing to worry about. The bad goblin... My workload is getting bigger and Juhee is ill more often. It's a new environment, she needs time to get used to it. I thought it will get better as time goes by. But the strange things are happening so often. I don't know what to think. Mommy. - Mommy. - Yes, honey. What the... Yes. - Hello? - Yes. Chief? This is Chae Min-young. Hi, Min-young. I see you're not at the office again today. No I'm not. What's going on? I should come by in person to tell you this... ...but I have no choice but to quit working. What? Did you say you're quitting? Yes. At this busy time of the year? I know, I should at least finish the work before quitting... What's going on with you really? My daughter is very ill. Wow construction Wow construction Contract Contractor Han Chang-su Choi Jong-sik, Kang Hyun-mee You know, it doesn't feel right... incident with Miss Kang from 5th floor and all... Absolutely no signs of living together at dead man Han Chang-su's place. The dead person's name is Choi Jong-sik. Hello? Gil-Cheongjoo Construction Did you find the information I asked you? It wasn't easy but I got it. Demolition of Saejeong complex is a classified matter. I got it because I work for the subsidiary, and they told me to never mention it to anyone. These are the documents and pictures from that period. - Pictures? - Yes. Yes, demolition of this Saejeong complex was full of talks and happenings. Finally, Wow people sent thugs to kick out the remaining residents refusing to go away from their home. In midst of it, there was one person who stayed until the end. Strangely, that person just walked away refusing any compensation. Her name is Park Soon-OK and she lived in suite 404, building no. 3. So you're saying all the incidents at the complex you live in... are connected to the demolition of the apartment three years ago And what does Ms. Park Soon-OK have to do with it? Park Soon-OK, she must've been murdered by those thugs. Are you saying the dead woman named Park Soon-OK... ...came back as a ghost and began killing those people? Yes, I'm positive. Ma'am, their deaths have nothing to do with murder. Kang Hyun-mee died from a fall, Choi Jong-sik died from an elevator accident. And Han Chang-su died from a drug overdose, all confirmed. You can't just investigate based on an assumption. I'm not saying it just based on an assumption. Oh my... Unless it's a sure case or it has been filed, it's difficult for us to conduct investigation. But people have been dying lately. I told you those have nothing to do with murder. And you think we have leisure time to listen to some ghost shit now? Min-young, Juhee disappeared. What, Juhee? Looked everywhere nearby, couldn't find her. When did she disappear? She was here at lunchtime then she disappeared...! Min-young! I'm never leaving this place, ever. Juhee! Juhee! Juhee! Juhee! Juhee! Juhee! Juhee! Juhee! Mister. Juhee's mom, how are you? Have you seen my daughter? - Huh? - My daughter. Did something happen? No, I haven't seen her I can't find her anywhere. Is that right? Come to think of it, I haven't seen her all day today. I would look for her with you if not for my store. I just can't leave it vacant. Did you call the police? No, not yet Don't worry too much, I'm sure she's around nearby. Okay, I understand. Hello? Juhee? It's me, Jieun. Hi, what's up? Got the name of person in charge of the demolition service. His name is Park Byung-do, I'm sending his photo to your phone now. Thanks a lot. Why is my picture here? Lady, don't forget your cellular phone. You... You killed Park Soon-OK, right? Park Soon-OK, that bitch brought it upon herself. Had to do the demolition work and the bitch refused to leave until the end. What about my daughter, Juhee? I don't know where the fuck your daughter is. This is not going to solve everything. I killed that Soon-OK bitch. Killing someone like you is nothing. Even if you kill me... ...that will not take care of their grudge. Grudge? I don't believe in stuff like that. Neither did I... until now. Now it's your turn... your turn to die. My turn? No, it's your turn to die. Juhee... Juhee... Come here, little girl. No, don't! Juhee! Juhee! Juhee... Juhee... Hey little girl, stop running Juhee... Juhee... Hey kid, where are you? There is no use in hiding. Juhee! Mommy! Juhee! Juhee! There's no 4. Where's 4, mommy? Guess there's no 4th floor here. I told you to keep quiet! Juhee! Juhee! Juhee! Juhee! Juhee! Juhee! Get on it. Sir, sir... Isn't that blood? Juhee. What's going on? A boy is dead. Get rid of it. Mingu... my Mingu. Open your eyes, Mingu... Mingu. Mingu! Mingu! Mingu, my Mingu! - Hey, get outta here! - Mingu, get up, please! What are you going to do? What are you going to do? Save him! What are you going to do now? Get my Mingu back alive! What are you going to do? Mommy... I know how sorry you are, how much pain you went through. Mommy... Mommy... Juhee! Are you okay? Are you saying bodies are buried beneath 504, so we must dig them up? Yes, buildings have spaces between each floor to block out the noises. That's where a woman named Park Soon-OK and her son are buried. So you are saying all four deaths in this building are related to the death of this Park lady. Ms. Chae, since all four related parties are dead now then the curse is lifted as well, right? What she really wants is for the remains of her son and her to be brought out. Chae min-young, are you writing a novel or something? Or are you threatening us? Threatening you? If not, why are you telling us the story? Must dig up the bodies... would you believe it, having no evidence whatsoever? Although we don't do this generally but we will give you back the deposit without the penalty, so just leave. What are you saying? I'm saying, just move out. I'm not telling you this just to move out of here. I'm saying you must remove the bodies of mother and child buried here. I'm not sure how much you're getting paid to do this silly shit. I promise you if you continue spreading terrible rumors... ...you must be ready to face me in court for both economic and psychological damages! You decide. Just walk away or well have a showdown in court. How could you... as a human being...! It's there... they just don't wanna believe it, that's all If you're done, please give me the keys. Just forget about it. Park Soon-OK gets neglected even she is died. Let's go.
