Yeah local customs, you sound like Tamer. Yeah he used to say like that when he was younger. Now he's wasting his life. What do you mean? There are a lot of customers for what he sells. And it's easy money. But he's putting everybody at risk. Like his wife, his daughters, me... Can't you erm... I don't know just talk to him, get him some more work here or... Well he works here every now and again but he falls back into it. Hm. Anyway I erm... I shouldn't be bothering you with all this stuff. No, no. It's alright, it's alright. So, you want to get used to the local customs? -Yep. -What are you doing on Saturday? Erm. Nothing. Come with me to the fights then. -Boxing? -Nah, not boxing. -What then? -You'll see when we go there. -Ok. -Ok. I've got to go now. This coming Saturday. -Cool. -Ok.

No no no, your f..g bike, man. There's your f..g bike, there's the things you leave on the window. It is your f..g tennant, I know. By the canal in the night. Anyway, Alison's cafe was there for years and years and years. Sold out to a betting shop. Betting shop couldn't take any money... ...because everyone's betting online nowadays. Now it's closed down, now they turn it into some, what they call it? They call it an Eastern European pickled cabbage brasserie. There you are brasserie, it's a brasserie. Anyway whatever they call it, a cup of f..g coffee it cost me ?4.95. -How much? -A fiver. -A fiver for a cup of coffee-... -Don't get coffee from there... ...what are you complaining?

One season, and that was about it. Carroll, what a lazy b..d he is. A one legged midget play better than him. Bobby's missus play better than him. And her a..ehole's almost touching the ground. Which ones, erm, Carroll? Why did you laugh if you don't know what we're talking about? I don't... Ah leave him alone, he's alright. I tell you what, Hasan, I ain't coming here anymore. -Why not? -Because... This ain't a pork sausage. It's a bleeding beef sausage. Leave him, he's joking. What's wrong with beef? At least they can fry an egg in here. Not like the last time you took us, what... What was that? Chicken, pigeon or dead dog? I can't tell the difference. Come on let's f..k off out of here. Thank you. Is that life in the U.K.? Yes. How's it going? It's all right. I already failed the test once. Well, I'm, I'm a-a teacher, and so...

Fourteen Twenty please mate. Cheers. Fourteen quid for coffee and beans. Ridiculous. Yes, mate. Hi. Put these in one bag? -Yep. Do you think I'm stupid? -What's the problem? -You're trying to rob me. You gave me four eighty instead of five eighty... ...and you thought, I wouldn't notice. No, I made a mistake I'm sorry. Yeah yeah yeah, 'course you f..g did. Like I said, I gave you one coin less. I'm sorry. There you go. You f..g Paki's, you come to England... ...to steal from us, and you think we're... Don't you ever step foot in this shop ever again! You hear me. I'll burn the f..g place down, you c..t! Yeah, I was born in England, you f..g p..k! I'm not frightened of them c..ts, let me go! What the f..k it's got to do with you, it's none of your business. This is my f..g Manor. Ok. This is f..g full of them. You enjoyed the fight on Saturday didn't ya? Yeah. Yeah. By the way, at the fight I saw you erm... Selling stuff... -What? Yeah, at the fight I just saw you sell... -What, what's your prob... -I wasn't... I'm not going to do anything about it. Ok? You're a friend of Hasan's, aren't 'ya? Yeah. Yeah Listen... I don't sell any weed or lazy s..t like that... ...I sell medicine. I sell prescription pills. Medical stuff. -Yeah. I don't sell to clubs. I don't sell to parties either. There's enough f..g hipsters. I don't want 'em mating with each other. Know what I mean? Richard? Richard? Richard? Richard? You've got a thing. Eight thirty. I'm really sorry. I had an issue with my flat. This is the last time. -I'm paying my rent every week. -No you're not paying. My brother was living here for ten years they never raised the rent. -Well things change. -I'm not earning any more money... ...I can't pay you one quid more -Listen it's very simple... ...either you sign the contract on Monday, you accept the raise... ...or you're moving out next week. I've got tons of people waiting and they're ready to pay twice... ...as much to be at this place. Honestly I'm doing you a favour. Pure f..g man, man. What? I'm not a f..g charity, am I? Hey, hi. Follow me sweetie. What is it? Ketamin. Smells like Trimipramine. How'd you know what that smells like? Was taking some last year. I went to school together. No you should come. Oh, no I think I've heard of a, a house. What're you doing? What are you doing? What the f..k's wrong with you? What are you doing? -Who's this? -Don't touch me. -I love you. -What the f..k is wrong with you? What have you taken? The f..k have you taken? -I love you. -F..k off, what are you doing? Trimipramine. What you ask for. -How did you get it? -Do I ask you questions? Do I ask you why you take the stuff? How you take it? Do I? -No. -Well then don't ask me anything. All I'm telling you is, you be careful how you take that stuff. It'll do your f..g brain in. Do you see what I mean? -Did you tell them? -What? -Did you tell them? -I didn't say anything. It was me who wanted to keep it between us. Remember? Richard? People looked you up. You were supposed to protect me. Do you understand that? Listen. They're not going to say anything. They want to keep their jobs as well. It's not going to change much. For you. Maybe. Have a good day. Listen to this. So? What is it? Do you like it? Why do... Do you like it? If you don't like it, just say so. No, no it's not that I don't like it. It's just if you... If you can tell me what it was then I could listen to it at home. And then get used to it. Stop trying so hard. Never ask me for this stuff again. I don't like selling that c..p, it makes me feel guilty. You sure you want to be carrying that much about with you? Well it's not for me. Suit yourself. Look at these people. Look at them, they think they own the Manor. A few years ago they wouldn't have set foot 'round here. Someone ought to show them they're not welcome. I was watching this program on the TV last week... ...about the ebola virus, do you know how it spreads? What I got from it. Was that when it gets into your blood... ...the first thing it does is hides nicely. Calmly. Then it triggers an illness, which is totally unrelated to ebola. It's an illness which has made your cholesterol increase. So you think, you're living too fat and too nicely. So you eat less. And then as your body gets weaker. This is when your immune system kicks in. It realises there's a problem. And it sends out cells. To destroy the ebola. But this ebola's a clever little f..r. Cos it hides within the very cells... ...your immune system is sending out to eradicate it. Your immune system's sending out cells all the time. Everywhere. Continuously. Everywhere, every part of your body. So in a way... ..it's the immune system which is causing the virus to spread. Do you get me now? Do you see how I'm feeling when I look at these f..g idiots. Knowing that it's the locals that making them welcome. Just because they supposedly bring some money into the area. I hate them. I hate them with a f..g passion. Hi. I've got your thing, can you, can you pay me back tonight? You've got something to tell us first, don't you think? What? We know. Know what? What do you? -Richard we know. What did he tell you? Why don't you tell us? I think it's time you told us the truth, don't you darling? -Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. -Ah, f..k, get off me! What the f..k is this? -That's Chloe. -You can't have this here. Come on. Half the people in here have got that up their nose. Are you f..g kidding? Give it back, argh. -Is Hasan here? -He's at the back. Come in! Richard! What happened to you? -Oh, I started boxing. -You did? -Yeah. There's a club at my University. How's it going? Well, ok. The kids won't answer their phones. My wife's angry with me for some reason. My brother's in trouble. I haven't been better. -Tamer again? -Yeah, of course. What happened? Well he hasn't been around for two weeks. And no one knows where he is. He left... The keys to his house and some money. Uh, but his wife and kids are staying at mine. That's Tamer for you. Can I talk to you? Yeah, what? I just, ah, could... Really do with, you know. Just talking to someone. Have you eaten? -No. -Go and grab a table. I'll be with you in a sec. I've got two more slices left. -Ok. -Ok. -Thanks. -Not at all. Voil?, tu continues ? hurler... tr?s bien. Je vais raccrocher. Tr?s bien. Je t'emmerde. -How you doing man? -Yep. How's it going? Good? -Yeah. Sit down. Sit down. So how's the flat? -It's good. -Hm? You know I got good feedback. Yeah the neighbours are happy, man. Apparently there's no music. No parties. How long you been here for man? You've been here for months. Right? Look listen, honestly, if you want to make friends or whatever. If you want to meet new people. Just give me a ring. I'll introduce you to some people. Can I ask you a question? Sure. Meats are ready. One of you care with them. Where do you get your hair done? -You want to get a haircut? -Look who is here. My favourite estate agent. How many people have you managed... ...to stuff into the same s..t hole today? Did you send anyone back to Syria? The Russians are not coming yet. Oh yeah, very funny. Ah, oh, did you hear about Terence? -Go on. -Who's Terence? Who's Terence? Terence is the guy, the old guy. He's got the, the shop on Beccle's street you know? Opposite the newsagent. -Yeah, what? -Terence... ..sold to Marks and Spencer. -No, he didn't. -Oh, yes, he did. No he didn't. He said he would never sell to a big company. You see, we can't all be you. No. Yeah, next thing you know there'll be like a... ...a Tesco instead of Partise shop. -No. -Come on man, wouldn't you do it?' No way. No way. Until someone comes along and gives you an offer for this like. Amazing kebab shop. You will turn it down? -Over my dead body, no way... It's simple. -No it's not. -Now no no, it is simple. Trust me. I know what i'm talking about here. Someone is going to come and make an offer... ...you're going to study it. If it's bad you say no... ...if it's good you say yes and you get the money. Listen, this is not an investment. All right, this is part of my life. I've got my friends here. My children grew up here, the smell of it, the look of it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you mind if I answer like, point by point. You say this place is not an investment? Sorry. This place is a commercial venture. It's not like a, a sentimental you know, placement. It's not a house in the south of France is it? It's supposed to make money. You say your children grew up here? Are you really proud of that? -Yes I am. You're boasting about this? Are you seriously boasting about the fact... ...that your children grew up in a kebab shop. Wonderful environment, huh? -I'm going to call Terence. -Come on man, Hasan I'm just... Taking the piss out of... -Where's my telephone. Telephone. -Oh, come on... ...where's your sense of humour, man. Yeah you can call him if you want. -Yeah. I don't know maybe he's not picking up the phone in Spain. Irritating f..k. -Oh, got a date? -Yeah. Four ninety nine please. -Where's Aneek? -Er, Anak. -Anak. -He's gone. -He's gone? Where? -Home. Bangladesh, they kicked him out. Uh, why? Well... He and his wife's visa ran out... ...a few months ago and they estate agent... ...called the immigration services. He wouldn't leave his flat. Thanks. S..t. Yeah. Right. Thanks. Have a good one. -F..k off! -What the f..k... What are you doing? What the f..k is wrong with you? What goes through your mind? We are not together. -Wait. Wait please. Please. -F..k off! I need to f..g get out of here, I need to get out of here. I'm just trying to call a f..g cab, all right? Call it from my place. It's freezing. I'm fine, thank you. I've- I've got some more of that stuff, if you want. What? Ket? How much do you have? -Lots, I haven't used any. All right. Just here. Jesus. Can't believe I'm in your flat. I mean, it's tasteless. It's not as bad as I thought it would be. I'm really happy you're here. Why? You're my girlfriend. No I'm not. I think it's time we had a little chat. You make people uncomfortable. No one wants you hanging around them, wearing... ...the stupid f..g jacket you always wear. And everyone laughs about it. Do you realise that? You don't have any friends. -I have you. -No you don't. -Great. -I'm not you're f..g girlfriend. I'm not even your f..g friend, I never think about you. Where's the ket Richard? Get out of here! Get out of here! Now! Get out of here now! Now! Get up! Get up! Get out! -You're done. Shut up! You, Tamer! Who were they? Were you listening? What did they want? Can I talk to you? Not the best time. -Hasan. -Tomorrow, I'm in trouble. Ok? Don't you have things to do? Go. Wow. You should go. Have you seen Chloe? Word to the wise, forget her. She doesn't care about you. Have you seen her recently? No. She probably went away with some guy. You know, went off to Africa to save the world. Yeah, she does that a lot. Rich parents. She can come and go as she pleases. Life's little butterfly. Tell her I said hi. I, sell them, a consumer good. I'm just setting my price according to market. Like if some rich kid, trust fund comes through here... ...and wants to spend like humongous amount of money. To live in f..g Dalston so he can ponce about... ...like an all well groomed like caveman. That's his problem. I am right to set my prices high as a I possibly can. This is how I make money, you understand that? You know what? People pay. They accept the raise. They make an effort they find a f..g solution. They want to live here, otherwise they would... ...f..g move out and they don't. Mais quand m?me il y a bien un moment... ...o? t'es all? sur l'historique... ...et t'as regard? dans mon ordinateur... ...et t'as bien vu des trucs, tu vois? Donc c'est... Mais non j'ai pas... J'en sais rien moi je sais pas... Je sais pas quand je les ai... Hm. Yeah. Mais... vas-y... ...non mais vas-y mais fais- toi plaisir... Mais baise qui tu veux j'en ai rien ? foutre moi! -Who was that? -My girlfriend. You want a drink man? Yeah. Why wasn't she here? Oh... She's got the flight tomorrow at six am... ...so in Heathrow and she's neurotic... ...so when she flies she needs her space or whatever... -You live alone? -Yeah. Never shared the flat with anyone? No. Why? I definitely heard someone, are you sure there's no one here? Can you hear that? Finish your whisky mate. It's late, I'm tired. You know, you're right. I-I don't have many people to talk to. I-I don't have many friends -Ah, don't say that I mean... No you're right. Listen I was just joking with you. I'm going to play you a song. Nah, listen mate another time. You're going to love it. Nah, no it's not the right time, mate. Seriously. Ah, you can't play music. There's neighbours. No that's too loud, got neighbours, man. No you... no you can't. No! No... Usual? Police. -Yeah? -Yeah. Did you hear about Thomas? What happened? He was killed. How? I don't know. All I know is he was found dead in his flat. And they say... ...he's murdered. -Do they know who did it? -No. Well, they didn't say anything. What did you say to them? That... He came here sometimes. What else? I'm not surprised. Hm? I'm not surprised. He, he had it coming to him. Why, what do you mean? He... No one liked him, everyone hated him. What? He was a p..k, he was a heartless p..k... ...and he- he put people out on the street. He didn't care he joked about it. You even said so yourself, I mean how many times have I heard you... ...tearing him apart. Don't you have respect for the dead? No it's not that, it's just... You're being a hypocrite. He was a p..k and he deserved to die. I don't want to hear this. -He deserved it... -I don't want to f..g hear this. You don't care. Ok, can you, can you please get out? -Everyone hated him... -I don't wan't to see you. Can you, can you get out? -He went around joking about it. Don't... get out, can you please get out? -Why are you such a f..g hypocrit? -Get out! Get the f..k out! Get out you disrespectful s..t. That's the last ones, I can't be getting you anymore. What? -Why? -Because it's too risky. Everytime I pick them up... -I'll pay you more. -I don't care about it. I need these pills. For my health. Well then go and see a bloody doctor. I can't, they won't give me what I need. I don't give a f..k what you need. No more pills, do you get it? Now get out the car. No. What's wrong with you? Don't you understand English? Get out of the f..g car... You need to give me more pills, if I need more pills. Who the f..g hell do you think you are? I'm not your f..g doctor. Get out the f..g car. Give me my f..g pills. I don't want to see you again. Do you hear me? You forget my number. Sort yourself out with your f..g head pills. Look I've got loads of hours of footage on the CCTV. Can I come in? All right. I'm sorry about last time. I was upset. It's all right I was upset too. Erm... Yeah, come have a seat. Yeah. Yeah. Who's playing? Turkey and Brazil. Oh, come on! Do you want a beer? -Erm, yeah? -Yeah, ok. I didn't know you drank. Aha. And you thought I lived in a tent? And came to work on a camel? I have five wives all with burkas? Is that what you thought? Nah. No, it's nothing like that. Cheers. Cheers. Five wives... I would be so lucky. Always the same thing. We play better. But we lose. The police were here again. -Yeah? -Yeah. These murders. What did they say? They don't have much to go on. They said... Keep an eye out. I don't know. Do you want Raki? -Huh? -Haven't you heard of it before? -Nah. -No? -No... -You're kidding me? No... No. The best drink in the world. -Yeah? -Yeah. Now. "?erefe." -"?erefe" -"?erefe." That's right. Means cheers. Hm! Not all at once. One sip at at time. Saw you at Newington. Oh, yeah. Eh, my nieces. They are... -What did you ask her? -Who? -Olivia, what did you ask her? What are you talking about? What do you know about me? What you told me. You er... Teach at the University. Erm... You have a girlfriend. And you believed me. Yeah. Why not? I was accused of child abuse. Is it true? Do you think? Do you think I could do that? Never. I never even saw her... I didn't even know who she was. She... Didn't know her name. I-I... I went walking through those woods I... Like I always did. And the next day they, they came to the school. And they pulled me out of my class, and they asked me questions. They took me to... ...the station. And that's when it all started. The rumours. The looks. Backs turning on me, people glaring. I couldn't cope. I went to the hospital I... They... They took care of me. It took months. Before they cleared my name. One article. Page nineteen of the local newspaper. But it was too late. I'd lost everything. My health. My reputation. So I... I moved to London. For a fresh start. And then... It just happened, all over again. The same thing, just different faces. Chloe. Bruno. Thomas. Do you know what it's like to have... Every single person in your life... ...turn their back on you. Do you... Do you know what that's like? Erm... Where are you going? Just to have some water.
