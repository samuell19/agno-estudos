Honey. Honey. Yes? My gosh. My gosh. Be careful, honey. You almost fell. You're carrying a baby now, should you do hard work like this? - Be careful. - It's okay. It's not okay. Soon I will be the happiest woman in the world. We. Me... ...and you. Flora... ...and Fiona. So, you've decided already? We're going to name them Flora... ...and Fiona. Pretty names, right? Flora Adelia Baskoro and Fiona Adelia Baskoro. Such beautiful names. I need to leave now. I have a meeting with my investor to discuss my factory. This is for us, too. And for you, too. You are my harbour of life. Where my breath stops to become an everlasting love. - I love you. - I love you, too. Take care. Hug me. Should I give you hug? Yes, please. But you haven't taken a bath. No. I have! Honey? Honey? Looking for me? You know it. I'll be leaving now. - Take care at home. - I will. - Bye. - Bye. Take care. Mel? Melina! Are you okay? Oh, no. You're bleeding. Miss! I need some help here! Keep it together. Ma'am? (ER) Steady your breath... Keep it steady. Come on, one more time. Come on. Please check it. No! =SAKRAL= Yes, dear... We're here. Welcome home, sir. Thanks. How are you? I'm fine. Thanks. Come on. Flora. Mommy will always be there for you forever. Even if I have to sacrifice my own life. Honey. Jessica sent this bouquet for you. I'll just put it there, okay? Don't. Just leave it here. Having to spend two weeks in hospital... ...I know it's been very hard for you. But you're not the only one. I can feel it, too. I'll be waiting in our room. Have you eaten, ma'am? I'll eat later. Stay strong, ma'am. I don't know... ...if I can make it through this. There are some beliefs that said... ...when an unborn baby died... ...they're actually still alive. They are alive in other form. And still roaming around inside their home. You should held a Slametan to make sure we will be safe. And I think... ...it can also help with your burden. Excuse me, ma'am. I'll be leaving now. ?Happy birthday to you? ?Happy birthday to you? ?Happy birthday, happy birthday? ?Happy birthday to you? Let's blow the candles with daddy. Come on, blow the candles. Blow it, honey. Come on, Flora. Flora, this is from mommy and daddy. Let me keep the cake first. Miss. I only want one wish. I want to see Flora's smile. It's been five years... ...and I've never heard a single word from her. Honey. Are you okay? Fiona. It must be that bad dream again. It's okay. Flora? Wait... Let's go back to our room. Something's weird. See if there's something. I will close it again. I think we should let her sleep in our room for tonight. Okay. Flora? Flora. Flora. Flora. What's wrong, dear? You want use the bathroom? Okay. Wait here. Mommy will get some tissue first, okay? Flora. Flora. Flora! Flora! Flora... Flora, are you okay? Are you okay? (Everyone Must Die) Honey? What's the matter? Something is written there... Writings? I don't see anything. But it was here! It was here. Come on. Let's go back to our room. You need some rest. Shall we get back to sleep, Flora? Your turn now. I did it. No cheating. Flora? Were you talking to someone? Why don't you come with me? I've prepared some fruits and milk that you like. I still can't let go of how I lost Flora's twin sister. And what makes it even worse... ...every year, someone we know passed away. I feel like... ...something is haunting me. Maybe Daniel will be next. And then me. Last night... ...I had a nightmare. There was a baby. And I saw a writing at the mirror... May I know what does it say? "Everyone must die." Mel, you need to calm down. Everything will be okay. Just try to stay positive. I see now. Your fear shows that you're having an excessive anxiety. This can further worsen her depression. And will hurt Melina's mental state. Moreover... ...you are starting to hear and see things. If she doesn't get help soon, her situation could be more severe. But keep in mind, this is only preliminary diagnose. It seems like Melina is having... ...early symptoms of schizophrenia. You think I'm insane? Mel, please listen to Ivan first. Ivan. Sorry about my wife. Things like this happens all the time. She's just being defensive as she's trying to defend something. Yeah. So, what should I do now? My suggestion is... ...to take her on a long vacation until she calmed down. It can be very helpful for her recovery. Honey. It's been a while since our last vacation. How about if we plan for one soon? You can pick. Is there any place you want to go? I need to go to somewehere quiet. Okay. I will make the arrangements. What's important to us now is to have a vacation soon. Are you okay, Mel? Are you okay, Honey? Ghost! A ghost? Where? She's over there! I don't see anything. There's no such thing as a ghost. I don't see anything. But I saw it. You must've seen other things. Is that Flora? Flora. Flora. Why are you still up this late? Your mommy will be so mad at you if she knew about this. Let's get back to bed. Flora? What now? Wait here. I will check the fuse box. Okay. Flora. You're a good girl. You're not scared of dark anymore. Miss? Miss. Miss, are you okay? Miss? Miss! Miss! Melina! Mel! Mel. Melina? Melina! Mel, snap out of it! It's me! It's me. What happened to you? I saw Miss... Come on. Come on, I'll help you up. What happened? Miss Astuti choked me. Miss Astuti has passed away. Thanks for giving us permission to check all the rooms. We will conduct an autopsy to the victim. Now if you will excuse me, we need to go now. Thank you, sir. Hello, Jess? Morning. Where are you? We're on the road, on a vacation. Melina is okay to go outside now? Apparently so. What is it? How's your study? It's all done. I have finished all my exams. So now, I have a long holiday ahead of me. That's great news. Maybe you can come here to help us. To babysit Flora, your niece. Where's Miss Astuti? Did she resign? She just passed away. Oh, my God. When did it happen? It was just last night. That's why I haven't told you about it. Good thing you called. What did she die of? It's a long story. I will tell you later when we meet, okay? Okay. See you later then. Here we are. Come on. We have arrived at the villa. Go with your mom. Come, Flora. So, do you like it? I like it so much. I'm happy if you like it. Thank you. Delicious, isn't it? So, are you happy now? I'm so happy. You did everything just as in our promise. What do you mean? You are my harbour of life. Where my breath stops. - To become an everlasting love. - To become an everlasting love. I wish that someday, a miracle would happen to Flora. I really want her to say "Papa, Mama". Yeah, I wished that too. Flora. - Flora. - Flora? Flora. Flora. Flora. - Flora. - Flora. - Flora. - Flora. - Flora. - Flora. There she is. Flora. Bianca? Daniel? Where have you been? Why did you suddenly appear out of nowhere? Were you looking for me? Yes. I was looking for you. Last time, I went to your place, but nobody was there. Flora! Flora! Flora, please don't go to far. I've been looking for you. Come on. You're still wearing that ring? I will never remove this ring. Anyway... ...how's your parents? They passed away. I'm sorry to hear that. Where have you been the last five years, and then you suddenly appear here? Should I tell you? Well, no, actually. I don't feel like telling you either. Honey. Bianca, meet my wife, Melina. - Bianca. - Melina. And you are... I am Daniel's old friend. You never told me about her. This is our daughter, Flora. Hi, Flora. I'm Bianca. You want to play, Flora? Catch me! Are you ticklish? Can you catch me? Come on. I've never seen Flora smiled around a stranger. You can't catch me! Come on, catch me! Flora. Let's have lunch. Something's wrong, Flora? You want Auntie Bianca to come, too? Why don't you join us, Bianca? One more? Where are you staying? I was just arrived. I don't know where I'll be staying. I want to come, auntie. Honey. God's miracle works so fast. Flora can smile now... ...even talk. Yeah. I'm so glad about it. I was not wrong to bring you and Flora here. I think... ...Bianca is an angel. What do you mean? Didn't you realize? Flora has changed... ...and Bianca brings us a whole new atmosphere. Right? Flora. Hi, darling. Go on, play again. I'm sorry, Bianca. We can't be together anymore. I can't continue our relationship. Why? But we are engaged. I know. But you know... ...my parents would never agree to our relationship. Daniel. Look at me. We can runaway. And then we get married... ...and live forever. Forgive me, but I can't. I want to see my parents happy. I hope you will find happiness out there. Here. Keep this with you. As a memento of our relationship. Daddy! Flora. Flora. You can call me daddy? Honey, did you hear that? - She called me daddy. - I know. - Flora. - Come here, darling. Since we're all here... ...how about if we play hide-and-seek? Okay. Let's do a hom-pim-pah. Whoever has their palm facing up, they lose. Understood? Let's begin. Flora, you're it! - Flora is it. - Flora, you have to look for us. You stand here and count to ten, and then look for us. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Mel? Melina! Mel? Melina! Come with me. Mel, what happened? I saw a ghost. Where? There. Wait here. Nothing here. There's nothing here. Everything is okay, honey. Come on, get up. We can stop playing for now. Come on. Hi. Hi. You're still awake? Yeah. You need something? Nothing. I just want to thank you. You have made Melina and Flora very happy today. I hope you understand, Daniel. There is one thing that I don't want to end. That is loving you. What do you mean? Daniel. Maybe what happened today... ...could make you happy. And I think that's enough to mend my broken heart. Yeah. Thank you for staying with us. You are welcome. You're planning to go somewhere? I am planning to continue my vacation here. Come with us, auntie. You have a nice room. I think I can sleep with you. Flora. I have to take Auntie Bianca to her room. I'll take her. Okay. Daddy will take auntie to her room. You will clean this room with mommy. Let's go, Bianca. You can rest here. Your life seems perfect. A beautiful wife... ...a lot of money... ...your daughter is also pretty. Bianca, stop it. It's all in the past. You are beautiful, too. I'm sure you will find someone better than me. All of these are supposed to be mine, isn't it? I hope you don't hold a grudge. And you are being sincere with me and my family. In return, I will welcome you. Enjoy your rest. Your life seems perfect. All of these are supposed to be mine, isnt' it? Something on your mind? Nothing. Thank you. Hi! Jessica! Oh, my God, how are you? I'm good. How's your flight? It was so good. Where's Melina? She is inside. Jess, I need to ask you favour. Why so serious? What's up? Please take care of Melina and Flora. You're being very serious right now. Is there a problem? Not at all. Just call me if anything happens, okay? - Okay. - Thanks. - Sis! - Jessica! - I miss you. - I miss you, too. I have to get going now. Take Jessica to her room. - Bye, Jess. - Bye. You better get some rest now. I have to take care of Flora. Okay. Thanks. My gosh. Flora. You really scared me. Flora? Flora? - Hi. - Hi. Why are you... I met your brother at Kawah Putih. I was on my vacation here, and he asked me to come along. Where were you? You disappeared. After our engagement failed... ...I went somewhere far. To recover myself. Flora. Let's call it a day, okay? You need to get some rest. I think I smell an incense. Bianca? Melina! Melina! Melina! Melina! Jess? I just saw Bianca. She is a ghost! Come on, hurry! You have to see it yourself. She was here... I swear I saw some kind of offerings here. Where is it now? Did you get rid of it? What are you talking about? Please. I know what I saw. Jess, stop it. Please, you have to believe me, sis. Jess. I don't want to cause any more trouble in this house. Please... Sis! I'm not seeing things, am I? That was... Bianca turned into a ghost. I can't be wrong. I'm sure. Something is wrong with her.

Come on, answer it! Hello? Bianca is... Jessica! Flora. Flora. Flora! It's mommy! Flora! Jess? Jessica! Jess? Jessica. Jess? Jessica! Five years I've been with Daniel. Only to be ruined by you. You've taken him away from me. But I'm not just going to let that happen. You have to suffer! You can never touch me. Melina! Melina. My hunch was right. You are a demon! I took your baby's body... ...as a sacrifice. On that day, I switched your baby... ...with a cursed baby in my alliance. To have my revenge on both of you... ...who have stolen my happiness! And on that same day too... ...I decided to end my life. I let the devil took my body. Five years later, I returned to Daniel. For your reckoning! I can't let you live. Everyone must die! Go! Go! Hurry up, drive! Okay. Flora? She's not Flora! - That's Flora! - No, she's not! That is not Flora. Flora is not our daughter. Hurry, Daniel! Drive! Drive faster! Jessica! Jess... - She's not Jessica. - That is Jessica. That's not Jessica! That's Jessica! Jessica is dead. I saw her myself. Just keep driving! Daniel, please believe me. Hurry up and drive! Daniel, hurry up! Flora! Flora! Flora! Are you okay? Jess... Jessica... No, she's not Jessica. - No, she's not Jessica. - That is Jessica. "Born of a fire, return to fire." Mel? Melina! Wake up, Mel!
