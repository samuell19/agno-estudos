CHLOROX AMMONIUM AND COFFEE ... This is not right. I quit. We can't be two midwives for all these women. Thank God it's not me giving birth here. Where is doctor Rampel? With the patient in 265. Where have you been, by the way? I checked a placenta. Send doctor Rampel to 265. I have to follow the husband in 222. Trust me on this one. Take it easy. Here is doctor Rampel. This patient is opposed to a caesarean operation. Opposed to it? We're just preparing you in case of a caesarean. - I don't want a caesarean. - Don't make this harder than it is. A caesarean operation is one way to get the child out. You can imagine what the alternative is. Say after me: I am veryr depressed. My mother is veryr depressed. Mutton in leg. My God. - Gunvor, did you bake any today? - Three pecan pies. There's an error on your sign. Leg of mutton, not mutton in leg. You should have stayed in Sweden where you speak the language. Had I not taken over when Uncle died, you wouldn't have this shop. Your uncle knew how to run a shop. You shop here because I have the best prices in town. How do you think it feels to buy from an immigrant? In my shop you are the immigrant and now I'll kick you out. - But I need milk. - There are other shops. Now they throw you out of the shops. Soon they'll rule the country. - These things are mine. - I'll vote for Hagen. - They work hard. - You'll never see me again. A quote for you. Every nation has the government it deserves ... I'll vote for Hagen, yes I will. No wonder old people become racists ... Milk. "Women Who Love Too Much"? Haven't you finished that book? You should read it. Listen to this: "By always seeking people and situations - - that are insecure, you avoid being responsible for yourself." - What's that supposed to mean? - You're late. Dinner's cold. I struggle from dusk till dawn, drowning in criminals, - - and what awaits me at home? A sour old bitch. Thank you. Sour old bitches make sacrifices for their families. Most of them work full time. Working double with all the tasks men don't want - - because they're too poorly paid and don't give any status. Where do you get it all from, brother? Unlike you I read both newspapers and books. High time they write about men who love too much. - I provide for you. - I'm an underpaid house-keeper. I iron your shirts, wash the floors, scrub the pots and pans. Men who love too much drown themselves in sports and work, - - while women play life savers. Just like your Anne. Anne? She just left. Did it ever occur to you why? Male chauvinist. I have a feeling life is just running through my fingers. I baptise children. Their parents promise to raise them as good Christians. I meet them again at their confirmation. I marry people and have a divorce rate of 70 percent. I bless dying people who got nothing out of life but hard work and bills. Can you tell me the meaning of all this? I don't get it. I wanted to be a vicar and get that spiritual dimension ... Preach to people from the pulpit about the meaning of life. And what have I got? A so-called "working church". An asexual building without a steeple and only a laminated rostrum. I whiz around on a service bike. The vicar up in Skedsmo, - - he's got a vicarage and a free car, while I sit here - - in a shitty two-room apartment and haven't even got a wife and children. It really sucks ... Cheers. Listen ...Torgeir and I are going fishing tomorrow. - You should come along. - Sounds wonderful. - You need some time off. - Thanks, but I have to work. They have taken my assistant since nobody shows up in for service. Soon I'll lose my job and be left with nothing. I hope they let me keep the choir. I need the choir. Damn it. Excuse me ... - How much do you need? - Three. We have seven millions. The Japanese want ten to start the production. I must admit it looks impressive. But, Erik ... Your partner over there ... You should get rid of him. He is my best friend. We designed the joystick together. I have no problem trusting you ... but see for yourself. He's just a little excited. I have to look more into the details before we make a contract. Kristin, find a day, please. - Check Friday. - Friday suits me perfectly. Dad, Friday looks fine. And you better take good care of her. She is my most precious gift. - Beautiful girl. - Talk is cheap. I'm not leaving, not without my joystick. Erik. Come on, help me. The twin brothers were over 200 metres tall and they were visited - - by men in fancy dress who were money traders. - Like Dad? - Yes. The brothers had to be reinforced with steel - - to carry all the things that piled up in them. Even if they did their best, they cried at night when nobody heard - - other than the wind that howled around their heavy steel bodies. Those who visited the brothers did not notice - - how they became hard as steel and spread this behaviour on to others. Soon, this harshness had spread around the whole world. It decided everything. How people lived, what they believed in and their thoughts. But one day, something very strange happened. The brothers let go and collapsed very, very slowly - - freed themselves from all the harshness, turned into dust - - and blew off with the wind ... 594. 595. 596. 597. 599. 600. Shit. Mummy. Why don't you just speak to that guy? This is the third summer you admire him through binoculars. That's none of your business. Breakfast is on the table. You can't go to school without breakfast. I'm not hungry. You never eat, and why do you wear all that make-up to school? - Everyone else does. - That is no reason you should. You're so moody. I want to live with Dad. Your dad hasn't cared for you since he met that bitch. Eat. This is good for you. My God, I'm tired. You've been tired since he left four years ago. Look what you did ... broke the plate and everything. Shit. Any more of this and I'll hold back your allowance. That reminds me ... My allowance ... I didn't get it last week either. I'll get double today. Double? Where's my handbag? You little extortionist. Here you are. 200. And I'll get 100 back. - No, you won't. I'll get double. - Fine, fine, fine. This is all I've got and payday is in two weeks. God, I'm tired. Can't you wear something else? All those rings can't be healthy. You can't eat with a pierced tongue. Don't be ridiculous. - Let's have dinner this afternoon. - I can't. I'm training. Tomorrow, then. I'm on a night watch. Tomorrow I have my confirmation instruction. Sunday, then. I'm on an extra night watch to get some more money. You always have to work so much. Sorry for being so sharp before. Take care of yourself out there. Of course. Don't you think I can take care of myself? - You cleaned out there yesterday. - I clean ... as much as I want. This balcony is not clean. Someone made a horrible mess here. Get some sleep instead. I'll go to bed as soon as this place is clean. I sleep better then. Don't use that terrible detergent. It stinks. Shut up. It's the only detergent that dissolves the fat coating. You're not normal. You know that, don't you? Oh, how beautiful... But not finished ... Not yet. - What's happening, darling? - It's a thunderstorm. It's nine o'clock. Shouldn't you be at work? Let's take the morning off. Are the restaurants open until seven in the morning? My God, you stink. I dreamt we were on a trip together. You were swimming in a lake. That sounds wonderful ... We can bike to the lake some day when I don't work late. When is that going to be? You said one year. Now almost two have passed since we had time together. - I'm securing our future, Maria. - Future? We could die tomorrow. - Don't fight, Mum. - Right. That's the one thing you do. Me, who does everything to let you work in peace. Doing what? I carry our number two, I deliver and pick Stian up at kindergarten. I have a full time job, I cook, wash the laundry, do the housework ... Stop it, Maria. Please. I love you. Do you have to pick quarrels in front of him? Could you find me a clean pair of pants, Dad? - Here. - Why are you angry with Mummy? - I'm not angry. - But I heard you were angry. I am not angry, I said, but if you continue like this I'll get angry. I told you not to play like that. How many times do I have to show you? Listen. - I ironed that shirt. - It is "I have ironed", darling. Get rid of that country dialect. Why do you iron my non-iron shirts if you are angry with me? Do you need money? I have money, Erik. We are a family and we're expecting another child. That's your project, remember. I have mine. Maybe I'll leave and we'll see how long you manage without my income. Have you met someone else? You're stupid. I was joking. You're my most precious thing. You make me so horny. But I ought to find someone who gives me love and respect as well. I love you, Erik. - What's going on? Do you need help? - Yes, please. That back of yours needs therapy. I can do it. It takes half an hour. Impossible. I'm on duty. What kind of therapy is it? Osteopathy. Therapy that sees the body as a whole. If your back aches, the pain may originate somewhere else. Osteo ... Jesus. Benjamin. That's the second time you miss your cue today. He apologizes and asks for a last chance. No ... That'll have to wait until Thursday. See you then, everyone. And don't forget your homework. - Butterfingers. - You try, if you think it's so easy. You insisted on a grill. You know how to jump on that damn trampoline. But jumping into life ... Brother, all your damn opinions about everything makes you unbearable. But you have no idea what goes on out there. I know more about life than you do. My young friends tell me everything. That's what you think. You need a new wife and children, to get a new perspective on things. - Perspective? - Yes, love, for example. Love? Where do you find that these days? - How was confirmation instruction? - Fine. We sing as well. - Choir is cooler than I thought. - I wish I could sing full time. That was the plan. But then I got a family and all. I'm back at eleven. Is something wrong, Elin? - Something is wrong. - It's nothing. Can't you tell me? The vicar said how easy it is to become addicted to drugs. - You do drugs? - No, no. And now I have to leave. Elin? Please. - Excuse me for being late. - It's okay. I was afraid you had given birth. We depend on you. If the royal baptism is placed in Lillestr?m, it will be a big day. There'll be a TV transmission. So get in there and hold tight. Let's take it from the top once more. - It's Iris. - Hi ... it's Maria. - Maria who? - Stian's mother. - Right ... Stian's mother ... - Elin baby sits for us. And I was just wondering ... Elin confessed something to me. She's in some kind of trouble. There may be drugs involved ... Let me tell you something. I know my own daughter very well. She is often a bit low at this time of the year because of the divorce. - So I'm afraid you're wrong. - I just felt I had to tell you. Why isn't Daddy picking up? You're dressed, Stian. Can you get it? - Hi. - Well, hello. - Your mum or dad, are they home? - Mum? - Is Mr Erik Gundersen at home? - No. He is out of town. - Are you Mrs Maria Gundersen? - Yes? Anette Nilsen, mortgage clerk. Can I come inside, so we don't have to discuss this in the corridor? Three notices have been sent out - - concerning an outstanding tax account for Erik Gundersen. - For how much? - 450,000. Plus unsettled electricity, phone and rent bills to the value of 60,000. Can you pay now, or do you have something that covers the debts? So that I don't have to start a forced sale of your flat? As long as you live together, it belongs to both of you. And we have to take out his half as a security. Should I call someone to comfort you while I finish my job around here? That won't be necessary. I have a copy of the protocol if you want to look into the details. Could you show me around so I can see if there's anything of interest? Drum set ... no ... That stereo is a Denon, right? We can take that. No, you won't. - Music is my life. - Hardly. I was a teacher once and lost my job, so here I am. These two sun beds from Erik's last bankruptcy must be of some value. They aren't worth anything. Sun beds are dangerous. I'll have to send a man over to get your stereo. Goodbye. Men ... Do I have to go to kindergarten today, Mum? Yes, but not until eleven. - Anything else? - No thanks. Maria calling Fine. That pain in your chest is tension. Do you want Xeroxat or Nefadar? Anti-depressants? Why? I just can't sleep. I feel so tired. You work too much, don't sleep at night. I'll put you on sick leave. - You can't. The unit needs me. - It'll manage fine without you. Some Rohypnol to make you sleep. And please try to relax a little. Did you hear what I said? I'm not going to take them. - What? - I'm not taking them. - What nice visitors I get. - Do you know where Erik is, Gunvor? - Give Granny a hug. - Your face is black, Granny. Do you know where he is? You should know, you live with him. Erik's coming today, with little Erik. I doubt it. The mortgage clerk visited us. Erik's coming over with little Erik. Erik is an honest guy. - You left the water running again. - Isn't that right, little Erik? You're like two drops of water. Would you like one of Granny's ice creams? Yes, please. Give the boy an ice cream, Maria, and I'll answer the phone. This place got very busy all of a sudden. One moment. I'll close the bedroom door. When are you coming over? Today is impossible. Maria's going out, I have to stay with Stian. I thought little Erik was coming along? Stian is sick. He's running a high fever. Has he really? Something he caught in the kindergarten. - And you are working hard? - Yes. We'll do it some other time. - Are you not well, Mum? - I'm fine, thanks. Do you have visitors? It's the boy next door. I have to answer the door. Bye-bye. - Hi, Elin. - Stian, are you at your Granny's? Granny. Elin? Aren't you at school? We have a free period. Is Gunvor in? Elin, gorgeous girl. Elin's doing some shopping for me. You go wait in the living room. - What do you want, honey? - I've got some wine for you. - Do you have something? - Sure. Lots. Thank you. Elin is so like her mother. Beautiful girl. - I don't know her mother. - Too bad. You should try Erik on the cell phone again, Maria, and I'll wash off. Gunvor ... Could you lend us some money? Or something to pawn. We owe 500,000, or they'll sell my flat. Do I have something ..? I have nothing. My late husband was capable of such things. But my son ... never. So don't think I had an easy life. But I never complained. - Can you use any of this? - So you don't believe me? - Can't you ask your own people? - Erik is your son. Before you pounced on him, he acted like my son. Please leave now. Granny must rest. - Give me that bag, Elin. - I get a headache from this room. Give me that bag. Marthe gave me painkillers. Open up a window. I can't teach with the noise from the highway. It's impossible to learn anything when there is no air. You have become so impertinent ... Are you all right? My God ... Did he empty my account as well? THE CREDIT CARD HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN - No money for ice cream? - I'll take care of that, Stian. - If you're broke, you're broke. - I'm sorry. 242 kroner. Excuse me, but the dispensing machine ate my credit card just now. I'm out of cash and I promised Stian to throw a party for his friends. So I was wondering ... Is it possible that I pay tomorrow? Yes, of course. That'll be fine. If you could just write your name, address and phone number here. - Well, have shit party, Stian. - A what? - I meant a lovely party. - Lovely ... Yes. Have a lovely party, Stian. There. Thank you. Thank you very much. You're one of a kind. Thank you. - How did you get in? - Through that door. - It's locked. I'm training. - You're a great dancer. Cut the crap and get out. Are you coming to the party tomorrow? - No. - Why not? I have great dope. You've got to quit the dope, Elin, it's fatal. And I have to train. You are the most beautiful person in the world. Could you please wait a moment? It's Maria again. I can't stop thinking about Elin. I've been in touch with a rehabilitation clinic. We need to talk. Could you please call me? Tell-tale bitch. - Could I speak to my mum? - She's busy with a patient. - I'll have her call you. - Thanks. Tell her it's important. Look. The patient in 267. I think she's too slow. The head is in a good position, so I thought I'd break the water. I agree. Is the head/womb contact good? Then do that. - Is this your wife's credit card? - Yes, it is. Erik's phone, this is Kristin. - Hello? - Who's calling? - Did you get a number? - There is no such thing here, Dad. - See? That's a kindergarten kid. - What do you mean by that? If you are petted by kindergarten aunties all day you become like that. My grandchildren are not going to kindergarten. - Hi, darling. - How much will your dad put in? Dad? How much can you put in? Can I help that man in the meantime? Tell him we'll call back in a moment. Beef fillet. - That's much cheaper in Sweden. - Who is short of money here? I am. - How much would you like? - Just wrap the whole thing. You've reached Erik Gundersen's answering machine. I'll get you. I'll get you. I'll get you, you damn dope dealer. Hi, Maria. You're due any moment now, I see. Stop. You'll come with me. Follow me, please. Come. Hi. - Do you have any larger ice creams? - Bigger? If you buy two it'll get bigger. Giant. I'll take this one. The money. - Give me the money. - We have that gun in our assortment. Everything alright? 10, 11, 12 ... That's OK. Thank you. Bye. Would you like a parish magazine? Would you like a parish magazine? Arresting an elderly woman like that. It's unheard of. Open up a window. It's terribly hot in here. Aren't you sweating to death in that leather outfit? Why aren't you at home knitting socks? Stealing like a raven and destroying youths with dope. I've paid taxes all my life. That should give me some privileges. - Facial cream and bath salt. - But dope for the young people? Rich people are parasitic all the time, and I don't sell, we swap. Those pills can't be that dangerous. We elderly are stuffed with them. Come on, Gunvor. I'll take you home. And you'll come by the station tomorrow. Just be careful they don't get pregnant. I'm off. "Women Who Love Too Much"? What's that about? About you, maybe. "Nothing is too hard, time consuming or costly - - if it helps the man you think you love." Or what about: "You choose men who give emotional pain - - because your self-confidence is so low - - you think you don't deserve to be loved." "So you find kind men boring." Do you recognize yourself? Who the fuck gives you the right to analyse me? Sorry, I didn't mean to ... It's the book ... Do you know how it feels to be let down in this condition? Have you ever had the tax inspector at your door? Owed 510,000? No, because you have only luxury problems, right? But I'm not a victim. Do you read me? I'm not a victim. I won't be a victim like my mother, grandmother, great-grandmother ... Fuck! Give me the money. The money. Give me the money. - Don't. I'm scared shitless by guns. - The money. Men who take advantage of women who love too much are finished! Finished! I'll shot if you don't give me the money until I count to ten. - Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. - I can't get to the cash register. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. - I said all the money. - You got all the money. It's not enough. There's got to be more. - There must be more. - Take the whole store if you like. I didn't want to come here. I wanted to be a zone therapist, massage feet. Let go of the gun. You are under arrest. The water burst. - The water burst. - My God, Odd. She's in labour. Why are you doing hold-ups if you're supposed to be at the hospital? - What do we do now, Jesus? - She must be taken to the hospital. I know nothing about these things. You have to come along. Me? - I'll call your husband. - He's dead. My God. Stian, I forgot to pick up Stian at the kindergarten. - What time is it? - Five past five. - Can you go by so I can get him? - In handcuffs? - You can take them off. - I don't trust her at all. I know the feeling. - Here are your things, Elin. - Super, thanks. But your mother's wallet won't do any longer. You owe big money. Forget about that. Now we can get through the priest nightmare. - No thanks. - Party spoiler. - You were to pick me up at three. - The train was stuck in the tunnel. - What's wrong, Mummy? - The baby's coming. She's done a runner. Women. We're going home. No, Stian, we're driving a police car with our new friends. You've made friends with a policeman? Yes, Odd. He promised to drive with sirens. I'll wear handcuffs, and we'll pretend I'm a dangerous robber. - Great, Mum. - Yes, isn't it? Our new friends, Odd and Jesus. - Jesus. - Jesus? Sit up front with me, Stian. He's far to small for that. He weighs only 22 kilos. But I'm supposed to be handcuffed. We pretend I'm a robber. Sure. Could you find a child's seat so he can see something? - Are you Maria? Iris, midwife. - Yes, I'm Maria. This is Stian. Jesus. Odd. Listen, the water burst a long time ago. Follow me. So you are going to be a big brother? Are you all right? Come with me in here. You wait outside with them, Stian. I'm not sick. Stian is coming with me. I have a room for you in the emergency ward next door. I forgot to introduce myself ... Iris. Maybe we'll meet or see each other ... In the emergency ward ... See you ... Maybe ... Stop eyeballing me, bitch. People in this country stare so much. - Cool trip. Everything is spinning. - At least you look very happy. - What? Aren't you coming? - You can come along to my mum. No fossils for me, thanks. Tickets, please. Your ticket, please. - I showed it to your colleague. - You didn't buy or show any ticket. Did your colleague smoke? I must have mistaken you for someone else. You might apologize. It's awful to be prejudiced towards young people. Great. We fooled him as well. - Am I the only one who's got money? - I stole 500 from my mum. - What does your mother say to that? - None of your business. I could tell her. I think I know who your mother is. - You're a minor. - Mind your own business, bitch. Relax, Jesus. We'll question her as soon as possible. Are we going to sit here until she has given birth? That could be one and a half day. I'd have let her go. - Beautiful woman. - What? Iris, the midwife. - Did you notice the chemistry? - So you find nurses alluring. My brother says I seek women who are trained to nurse and help men. Does he read "Women Who Love Too Much"? I'd like to meet him. Are you also reading that lady book? Normally, I don't read that stuff, but that book is terrific. Why? It gives me a true impression of your women. Today there's been a lot of them. Fucking chaos. Life is not made up of the days that pass, but of those we remember. A robber in labour and a retired kleptomaniac. - She's your customer. - Gunvor? - She cleans for that doctor ... - Doctor Rampel. - Her? - She gets paid with pills. And she has no scruples selling young people that shit. Odd, you keep breaking your professional secrecy. I trust you, Jesus. I was wondering if you would like a glass of water? What is that? Water ... Water. Maria is in 222. That is an emergency room. Emergency is perfect for her. Your wife wants to speak to you. She is not my wife. She's not? That hurt. You broke your professional secrecy. - I have to go to the bathroom, Mum. - Then I'll have to get up. Stian needs to go to the toilet. Could you please help him? Just a moment. Could you take Stian to the toilet? Meanwhile, I'll ask her some questions. Sure, I'll do anything for Stian. - I want Dad to come. - I thought so. - Where is he? - I don't know. But he met a lady with huge tits, so I guess Mum doesn't want to see him. - Do you remember his number? - No. We need Erik's number. - Isn't he dead? - Dad's not dead. No, Dad's not dead, Stian. I was just joking. Jesus, come here for a second. Erik is not supposed to be contacted. This is my project. Could you please call my babysitter - - at 90 10 64 77. Odd, could you let Stian re-park the car? Re-park the car? What are you talking about? Could you let Stian sit on your lap and drive the police car? I don't get it ... Find his father so he can come and get him. Act innocent. Stian, do you want to drive the police car? Odd. Remember the safety belt. Could you please buy him a hot dog? There's money in my wallet. Yes, yes. Can I try something out, without that strange breathing machine? Please. For one second? - Could you please lie on your side? - I have to lie on my back. Please lie on your side. Trust me, it's better for the baby. Just try to breathe with me. Sing along, please. My God. That's my favourite song. Now, lie on your side, and then ... I know that song so well. - I know you as well. - You robbed my store a while ago. Here we go again. Oh, that's nice ... Oh, how nice. Oh, how nice ... Here it comes again. - What does your father do? - He's quoted on the stock market. Watch this, Stian. 54 calling, over. Do you have the cell phone number for ... What's his name again? Erik Gundersen. Three million ... We are off to heaven, darling. - Hi, Dad. - Stian, aren't you asleep? I'm driving a police car with Odd and Mummy's having the baby. - Having the baby, now? - Can you pick me up? Yes ... Well, Stian... It's not very good timing ... I ... I'm coming, now ... Now... Daddy. Hello? Hello? Daddy? He's not there. Hello. Is someone there? You have to get Stian right away. Your wife is giving birth. - Why are you with Stian? - We'll discuss that when you arrive. Are you coming? Ahus Hospital. - Hello, son. - Mummy? I'm calling to tell you that I'm going for a night walk. Maybe I'll get to see the stars one last time. I'm going to jail. I haven't really told you how your dad was to live with. Stop it. I'm going to the hospital. Maria is having the baby right now. I just wanted to ... I'll stop now. I always dreamt of a sudden death ... Didn't get that much out of life, actually ... Not since my son was taken away from me - - and I was left alone with that tyrant of a husband. - I didn't remember it hurt so bad. - I'll just feel you. Deep breaths. Sadist! No one called me that since I got divorced. Now all I did is of no use. Jesus was best at virgin births, right? See. Now it's happening. Hello? - Do you hear me? - Martin? - Are you dead, too? - Gunvor? No. We are both alive. It's my lucky day today. You've been using my dope for weeks without paying, Elin. - Are you trying to fool us? - How much does she owe you? - 7000. Have you got that? - Give me two weeks. I'll get it. Two weeks? We're not playing shop! Let me out. That petrol station has enough cash in its register to clear your debts. - Let me out. - Calm down. - I want to get out. I'll jump. - Get the hoods on. Now! Are you crazy? - Mummy, I have to pee. - Nobody is peeing now. You go in while she is in the back. Take this. - I have to pee. - Nobody is peeing. I want my money. Do you understand? Stop whining. - Give me the money now. - The boss doesn't allow it. The money, now. The money, now. The money, now! The boss told us to ... - What can I do for you? - My wife is giving birth. - Here? - Of course, or I wouldn't be here. - Name? - Maria. At the moment I have ... one ... two ... four Marias giving birth. - Surname and date of birth. - Gundersen ... third of ... Let me think ... third of ... Fall ... winter ... spring ... summer? I don't remember. - Is she aware that you're coming? - No, my son called. You could at least have dressed decently. Your ID, please. - It's all in the car. - Did you drive here? Erik Gundersen, 10.02.60. Do you want my social security number? You can sit down and wait. You announced it so nicely in the paper the day Erik was born. But not a day went by when I didn't think of you. I love you, Martin, and now I'm dying. You won't die, Gunvor. Our time has finally come ... - I feel life running out of my body. - No, Gunvor ... No ... What can I say? Congratulations, of course. But what happened? What went wrong? Am I going to lose my favourite singer? What's up? Are you drunk? I'd say that was quite a normal reaction ... But I have to give you one last blessing. But before I do that I have to confess something to you, Maria. I have been in love with you since the first time I met you. - But I just gave birth. - Yes. And now you're going to die. Have you lost your mind? Let me see that paper. Gundersen, room 202. This is 222. Excuse me. - Can you forgive me? - Absolutely. Get dressed. My God. Button up. You're in a maternity ward. I was visiting a dying person and came in to a woman in labour ... Why was she in the emergency ward? They closed two maternity wards. It's down the hall and to the left. Thank you. I can see you're busy. Yes, it's a miracle we can stand on our feet. Elin. Iris. It's OK. She was involved in a robbery and got a superficial wound. It's OK. What happened? Thank God you're alive. I'm going to take care of you now. Mummy will take care of you. I've missed you, Dad. Promise not to leave again without saying goodbye. I promise, Stian. I promise. Odd. I called you. Is it normal that the police watch over women in labour? Not quite. Congratulations. It's a fine girl. Do you want to see her? Jesus. The hard thing about doing business is to avoid bad business. Iris wanted to examine something. She asked me to not let anyone in. Really? But ... Who are you? If you knew how much horror I have caused. Hello ... D?rum ... the vicar. Can I please give you your last blessing? Not until you have wed us. No buts. - But we need at least one witness. - My son will be our witness. Is there time? I want him to see his mother truly love someone before she dies. You have to be the witness at our wedding. Stop joking, Mum. Dad's been dead four years. I'm at the hospital. Maria had a girl. A girl who is not going to have to love too much. D?rum, the vicar. Your mother is seriously hurt. Come as fast as you can. Are you out of your mind? What does that sign say? That thing can cost lives in here, so turn it off. Your ex or wife or whatever it is - - asked me to tell you that this is her project. My God. Stian, it was Granny. She's been hit by a car. She's in 202. My boy. I got hit very hard, but it did me good, Stian. - You're not going to die, Granny? - Meet my boyfriend. Erik, come here. I eliminated true love. Don't you do that. Not one more day. Are you listening? I ask your forgiveness for all the bad things I did to you. That I chose to hate your beloved. That none of the choices you made were good enough for me. I've been a bad mother. I begrudged you everything out of fear of losing you. And that's exactly what happened. But I got what I deserved tonight when that car hit me. It must have been a miracle - - since Martin, whom I have loved all my life, found me. And now I got to see you as well. Mum. Promise me you never leave Stian again. He was worried. Children should be children - - and not worry about their parents. I promise, Mum. Will you please witness - - when Martin and I give each other our vows. Wait, Granny. I have to get Mum and the baby. What a lovely little girl. I brought Mum and my new friend. His name is Jesus. Good. I know Jesus. My, what a beautiful girl. Congratulations, Maria. Please forgive me. That little girl, whatever her name will be, is lucky. I never had any motherly care, so I know what I'm talking about. Pawn the painting in the living room. It's worth a lot of money. Your beautiful words have given me back faith in life. Maria? Brother? - I hereby ask you, Martin ..? - Pedersen. ... if you'll take this fantastic woman at your side to be your wife, - - and promise you'll love, hold and honour her until death thy part? - Yes. - Yes. - I haven't asked you yet, Gunvor. - There's no time. No. Then I declare you husband and wife. Congratulations. Congratulations, Maria. Could you please forgive me? Please? Can you take me back to my room, so Gunvor can rest. Stian.
