In the course of my long life, I've written a lot of history, but I've lived a fair bit of it too. We are the United States of America and in this moment... I was born in 1945. My generation was determined to make sure the post-war world lived up to the ideals for which millions had lost their lives... ...the defence of democracy against tyranny... ...the promise of true equality, and the dream of prosperity for all. The third is freedom from want... We knew there would be brutal battles ahead. I was in America in 1964 and saw first-hand the bitter struggle for civil rights. We will register to vote because as citizens of these United States, we have the right to do it. I was in Prague in '65 and could feel the stirrings of democracy before the Soviet tanks invaded, a premonition of present-day Ukraine. What I've seen is that in times of crisis it's not always politicians, but artists, musicians and writers who rouse us from indifference... I built the railroads. ...and become the true agents of change. At this crucial time in our lives, how can you be an artist and not reflect the times? In the face of violent push back and struggle, they opened our eyes, shamed our intolerance and changed our minds. Art can save people's lives. So this is a very personal project for me. Over the seven decades of my life, I've seen a lot of these visionaries in action. And their words, their painting, their music has given me an abiding faith in the moving force of culture. I still cling to that faith, perhaps now more than ever, when so many old ghosts have returned to haunt us. If there ever was a time when we needed to understand what great art can do for the future of humanity, that time surely is now. AIR RAID SIRENS I came into the world to the soundtrack of history, in the Marylebone Clinic on the 13th of February, 1945, during the Nazi rocket attacks on London... ...the very same night as one of the most destructive Allied air raids of the War. In the greatest blitz on Germany, 800 RAF Lancasters splashed 650,000 incendiary bombs on Dresden, Germany's seventh-largest city. As a young child, I remember wandering through the bombsites of burnt-out London. Some of my earliest memories were nightmares of what other little boys and girls must have endured as terror rained down from the skies. Even then, I understood a new kind of warfare had been unleashed on the world... ...and us defenceless civilians were its targets. I only learned later that this terrifying staple of modern war had first been tested out in another conflict before the Second World War began. This moment was captured in one of the greatest paintings of the 20th century, Picasso's Guernica, which depicts the bombing of a small town by the Nazis in the Spanish Civil War, as they joined forces with General Franco to crush the democratic Spanish Republic. This is the most profound meditation on cruelty and grief and sorrow and this puts us right in the middle of... ...all that sense of helplessness and cruelty. Up to this point, Picasso's manifesto, if he ever had one, was that painting was just painting, but what happened at Guernica and the Fascists' denial that they'd even done it drew from him a modern political masterpiece. And to give the painting maximum emotional power, amidst all the carnage, Picasso turned to the most heartbreaking symbol of sacrifice art had ever produced, Michelangelo's Pieta, transforming the Virgin Mary into every mother whose child had been murdered by the barbarity of war. Ever since, as each new tragedy crashes into our world, like now with Ukraine, Guernica has stood as a testament to the power of art to preserve the historical record and to speak truth to power. Towards the end of the War, a young French journalist came to interview Picasso and thought that she was being very clever quoting him as saying, apparently, so she thought, "Art and politics have absolutely nothing in common." And Picasso shouted at her, "That's a scandal!" But then he just went to write something down and this is what it said. "What do you think a painter is? "Do you think a painter just has eyes to see? "Do you think a musician just has ears to hear? "Do you think a boxer only has his muscle to hit someone? "No. An artist also is a political being, "alive to what happens to the world, be it passionate, terrible, "or pleasurable. "Painting is not done to decorate apartments. "It is a weapon of of fence "and defence against the enemy." First of the actual pictures from Spain in revolt. Gaumont British News tells a graphic story of bloodshed and violence. Death walks in sunny Spain. Much like Ukraine today, in the late 1930s, Spain became a crucible for the great battle between democracy and autocracy that would dominate the post-war world. Fighting the Fascists was a coalition of left-wing forces supported by Stalin. And it wasn't just Picasso who'd joined their cause. In December, 1936, a tall, young Englishman headed to Barcelona to join the ranks of foreigners risking their lives for freedom. His name was Eric Blair, better known as the writer, George Orwell. This is his son, Richard. These are shrapnel marks on the wall which are still here today. Orwell had joined a left-wing militia called POUM, but after three months fighting on the front, he returned to Barcelona to find members of the POUM being rounded up, accused of being a Fifth Column secretly fighting for Franco. But this was a lie, the result of a cynical misinformation campaign organised by Stalin and his secret police to purge the Spanish left of his political enemies. That's pretty scary, isn't it? The NKVD have gone to enormous lengths to produce fake evidence that would prove irrefutably that the POUM were traitors. This is a book called Espionage In Spain by a German called Max Rieger. Apparently, he was a defector from the POUM, but he never existed. He had no currency in this world at all. He was created by this gentleman here, Grigulevich. He had been ordered by Moscow to create all this fake news. That was his job, to dish on our an honest group of people that my father was involved with. Because the one thing that my father was was an honest man, and he would have been horrified to have seen all this. Absolutely horrified. In the orchestrated chaos that followed, many of Orwell's comrades and friends became Stalin's victims. Andres Nin was the leader of the POUM. Captured, taken to Madrid and put in jail, and ultimately, of course, executed. Georges Kopp. Poor old Georges was beaten and tortured. Bob Smillie, young lad, 22. He was caught and eventually died in prison, sadly. My father would have felt that very, very deeply, the way his friends had been treated. You know, the Russians were putting together a lot of information. Not as much as he realised, as we see here, but nevertheless, they were putting together information that was not going to do him a great deal of good. Orwell himself barely escaped with his life, crossing the border posing as a tourist. But the sense of betrayal never left him. Ten years later, everything he'd experienced in Spain would resurface in his great novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four. Orwell knew that his message about totalitarian lying would only find a mass audience if his book was truly great fiction. So you can see from his manuscripts how he paid attention to every word. You've never seen any degree of perfectionism like this. It's almost really as though he's rewriting the book entirely. Chunks are just simply hacked and cut and pruned away and replaced. This is just in the first paragraph and the correction is so difficult to read, I'm reading the facsimile here. "Winston Smith pushed open the glass door of Victory Mansions, "turned to the right down the passageway, "and pressed the button of the lift." And what it changes to is so much more ominously atmospheric. "Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast "in an effort to escape the vile wind, "slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, "though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust "from entering along with him." And just those changes he's made give you a sense, actually, of the writing, fashioning mind at its, you know, most brilliant best. It's set in dystopian London, a world entirely controlled by the Party and its supreme leader, Big Brother. The book's main character, Winston Smith, works in what's called the Ministry Of Truth. His job is to generate necessary lies, to rewrite the news and destroy information that's since been proven wrong - that's to say harmful to the Party. Routine corrections to Times of 19th December, 1983, where shown, quote, "A spokesman for the Ministry Of Plenty stated last night "that it will be necessary to reduce the chocolate ration to 20 grammes in April," unquote. Reprint entire back number and file. The great theme running through the book is the abolition of history, of memory, of the past. The Party's determination is to wipe the past clean. And today there are all sorts of news stories about Vladimir Putin, for example, rewriting the history of the Gulag Archipelago. The Chinese Government does not want to have any memory whatsoever of what happened in Tiananmen Square. There is a huge debate going on in the United States about how much you should remember the Founding Fathers of the American republic were slave owners and therefore the promise of equality rings slightly tinny or hollow in that respect. So memory is a weapon against the complacency of power. Such a careless report must not exist. And Orwell knows that, and the destruction of memory is critical to Party tyranny. Routine correction to Times of 17th March, 1984, where shown, quote, "In his broadcast speech last night, Big Brother..." Over the course of the book, Winston rebels, but after being ensnared by a ruthless Party official named O'Brien, he's eventually arrested. He's brought into the Ministry Of Love, which specialises in torture and the obliteration of any semblance of human independence or the possibility of recognising the difference between fact and fiction. 170. Winston's been tortured and at the very famous climactic moment, O'Brien holds up four fingers and says, "How many fingers am I holding up?" Four. And if the Party says it is not four, but five? Then how many? Four. The correct answer has to be what O'Brien wants it to be because you deny the evidence of your own eyes. Winston... Well, the message is to resist the destruction of independent thinking. Independent thinking was the absolutely necessary condition for a free, democratic and humane life for Orwell. In Nineteen Eighty-Four, Orwell didn't just predict our contemporary battle with misinformation. He understood how autocratic leaders manipulate our emotions and fears... Shout out his name. ALL: Goldstein! ...to consolidate their grip on power. This is a scene from the Nineteen Eighty-Four movie, directed by Michael Radford, with john Hurt as Winston Smith and Richard Burton as O'Brien. And the scene is the two minutes of hate from the Week Of Hate. And when Emmanuel Goldstein, the enemy of Big Brother and the Party, appears just as a face, nobody controls themselves. Their faces become a kind of rictus of mad loathing. HATE-FILLED CRIES Orwell describes it so interestingly because it's not just fanatics who can be swallowed up by the Two Minutes Of Hate. Anybody can. "The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate "was not that one was obliged to act apart, "but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining in. "Within thirty seconds, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledgehammer "seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, "turning one, even against one's will, into a grimacing, screaming lunatic." And, you know, you read that and it feels so extraordinary and prophetic, really, because contemporary politics - just think about a Trump rally, for example - has discovered what I call the glee of hatred. You think particularly of what Viktor Orban cynically made of George Soros during the Hungarian election campaign. George Soros is a Jewish billionaire and a philanthropist who set up a fund for the promotion of democratic freedom in the aftermath of the collapse of the Communist regimes. And he was an opponent of what Viktor Orban was doing to create illiberal democracy. So he's turned into a demon. And Viktor Orban had huge Emmanuel Goldstein-like photographs of George Soros at train stations and bus stops, saying, "If you don't vote for me, "you'll get a George Soros conspiracy regime." So this thing lives. And, you know, this kind of awful business in which argument has become a screaming match between yourself and everybody else who is a traitor is absolutely predicted by Orwell. The entire globe is today the site of a momentous conflict. The conflict is fought on every level of man's experience for the stakes are high. The conflict has become known over the last decade as the Cold War. Billed as a confrontation between freedom and totalitarian oppression, the Cold War wasn't just fought politically, but culturally. UPTEMPO JAZZ In the Soviet Union, artists were expected to subject their individuality to the service of the state. In America, unbeknownst to the artists themselves, the CIA secretly funded art that celebrated individual expression. But the most powerful plea for the necessity of a free life came from inside the Soviet Union itself, from this house in a small village on the outskirts of Moscow. This was where one of Russia's most famous poets, Boris Pasternak, would write, in secret, what he called his "last word", Doctor Zhivago, an epic novel about the tragedy of the Russian Revolution and the unconquerability of the human heart. Given the fate of so many of his friends in the great purges of the 1930s, he was doing so at great risk to his own life. At the height of the Cold War, Doctor Zhivago was turned into an epic film by David Lean, telling the story of a young doctor and poet, and his lover, Lara... Zhivago... ...whose lives are torn apart during and after the Bolshevik Revolution. Finished in 1955, the novel was unsurprisingly rejected by the Union Of Soviet Writers. So, in the hope it might be published, Pasternak arranged for six typescripts to be smuggled out of Russia, giving one of them to someone I knew very well. This is one of the great documents in the history of the literature of freedom. It's the copy of Doctor Zhivago that Boris Pasternak gave to Isaiah Berlin, the great philosopher. He was a great mentor to me when I was in Oxford in the '70s. And he was on his honeymoon in 1956 and he came to Peredelkino where Pasternak was living. He told me that reading it that night in a single sitting was an overwhelming experience. He knows immediately it's a masterpiece. Especially, I think, Zhivago's relationship with Lara, as something which was profoundly expressive of truth in humanity. And the ability of truth in humanity and love, love, to survive the most relentless brutality that politics can throw at you. This idea becomes dangerously explicit in a scene vividly brought to life in the film when Zhivago is abducted by Communist partisans and forced to live with them in the forest for two years. Comrade Doctor, I need a medical officer. Sorry, I have a wife and child in Varykino. Comrade Medical Officer, we are red partisans and we shoot deserters. Here, Zhivago has an astonishingly brave conversation with the partisan leader about the falseness of the Soviet political life. "I don't know of a movement further from the facts than Marxism. "I don't like people who are indifferent to truth. "The rulers of your minds indulge in proverbs, "but they've forgotten the main one - "that love cannot be forced. "You probably fancy there's no better place in the world for me "than your camp and your company. I probably should even bless you "and thank you for my captivity, "for your having liberated me from my family, "my son, my home, "my work, from everything that's dear to me and I live by." You know, that is absolutely... It's not just profoundly true, it's hugely explosive and dangerous in the 1950s. That's why it's a kind of... As close to a military threat to the Soviet Union as writing could ever be. What happened next could have come from the pages of a Cold War thriller. On January 2nd, 1958, two microfilms of Doctor Zhivago landed in the office of the CIA, most likely sent by MI6, possibly even made from the typescript given to Isaiah Berlin. Given the code name Dinosaur, the CIA's plan was to print it in its original language and have it smuggled back into Russia. The idea that the CIA has is that it should go to the World's Fair in Brussels. And it does, in 1958, in Belgium, and...13-year-old Simon Schama happens to be there, totally oblivious to this, I have to say. The idea is that Soviet tourists who are there, weirdly, in their thousands, I'm sure vetted by the Soviet authorities, should take it back into Russia with them and that, of course, is what Pasternak profoundly wants. The American pavilion was obviously off-limits. So the CIA co-opted the ally least likely to arouse suspicion. In a curtained room, somewhere at the back of the Vatican pavilion, there are copies of Doctor Zhivago and there are stories told about how it has to be torn up and Russians are stuffing it in their pockets or sewing it into their trousers or whatever they did to get it out of the country. With the book now published in Russian, Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize For Literature in October, 1958. The celebrations were caught on camera, but they were short-lived. A few days later, he was forced to reject the Prize. The retributions were terrible. Threatened with deportation, his state pension was cut. Everything he had written was outlawed, made to vanish. Stricken with cancer, two years later Pasternak died. So here's the poem Pasternak wrote after he had been forced to decline the Prize. "I am lost, like a beast in an enclosure. "Somewhere are people, freedom and light. "Behind me is the noise of pursuit, "And there is no way out. "But what wicked thing have I done, "I, the 'murderer', and 'villain'? "I, who force the whole world to cry Over the beauty of my land. "But in any case, I am near my grave, "And I believe the time will come "When the spirit of good will conquer wickedness and infamy." He didn't live to see complete vindication. The first edition in Russia, free edition, was 1988. And you wonder really now whether anything that free and that independent would be tolerated. We're going through a period right now when darkness and terror is descending on writers in Russia again. Nadya Tolokonnikova is one of the most outspoken Russian dissidents. I met her in a secret location, several months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A member of the punk collective Pussy Riot, she was jailed in 2012 for staging an art intervention in one of Moscow's most sacred spaces. Since her release, she's gone on using performance art to highlight Putin's repression of freedom of expression. I mean, I was arrested, I was harassed by the police, I was whipped by Cossacks, crooks throwing chemical liquid in my face, so really nothing worse besides death can happen in my life. What gave you the idea, you know, that performance action really could completely shake things up, that art could do that, in a way? Mm-hm. I think art is a great tool of mastering people's minds without any sort of violence. I mean, like, you can say, you can argue that it's still symbolic violence, or violence because you convince people to believe in something, but I think it's completely consensual. So I think art has a lot of power in shaping humans' perception, and I think it's one way to work with political matters. CROWD CHANTING In early 2021, when protests broke out after the arrest of Alexei Navalny, Putin's most high-profile critic, Nadya responded with her video, Rage. This is one of those videos when you have a lot of people donating their time and passion. They're young Russians, who before would go to demonstrations and now they come to Pussy Riot to support us through art, but cops raided the building, and we were getting arrested. All of those volunteers who came to support us, they were so dedicated. None of them would be scared by the presence of the police. I have goose bumps when I think about it because those young Russians give me so much hope that it's just a matter of time to see how this Russia is going to render obsolete the old Russia that is represented by Putin. That special house what you see now, it isn't dream of Corbusier, but I think more dream of George Orwell because it is house of police and all clay, every clay, they live inside. Ancl they follow everything what I do. They are my new neighbours. For Russian activists like Nadya, one country has always been the blueprint for cultural resistance. From the mid 1960s to 1989, it was the artists and writers of Czechoslovakia who kept the flame of independent thought alive. Their resistance would make for one of the greatest stories of the rebirth of democratic freedom in my lifetime. I happened to travel to Czechoslovakia as a young student in 1965. It was so ravishingly beautiful and yet so under the grip of something that was very ugly. You know, the sort of sense of suspicion and paranoia, but life was stirring. You know, my friend and I both realised immediately there were part-time spies in all the cafes to keep an eye on us. You were incredibly conscious of the undercover presence of internal security. And, you know, there was something about the darkness of Communist authoritarianism, but the sort of sense also that the ice was cracking, and if you went there you would hear it. And we did hear it. You could tell that there was a kind of, um... ...sort of angry fatigue really happening, which was so interesting. Three years later, the ice duly cracked. There was gaiety and optimism in spring, 1968, when Dubcek and his comrades laid down the principles for a new democracy. In defiance of Moscow, Alexander Dubcek, the head of the country's Communist Party, began reforms to the economy, travel and, astonishingly, free speech in what came to be known as the Prague Spring. Moscow's response was brutal. Over two terrifying days in August, the Soviets invaded, pouring half a million troops and 5,000 tanks into the country. The radio station was the hottest of hot spots and this plaque, all the people who were fatalities in the burning radio station, on the first full day of occupation. Two of them died jumping from burning buildings. Other people were shot on this horrible day of 21st of August, '68. The tragedy of invasion led to a bitter debate between two of Czechoslovakia's most important writers, one which resonates powerfully in our own time. There was an extraordinary crossing of swords about this crucial issue - what can art, writing, music, what can creative people do about freedom? Can they ever make any difference to the survival of democracy? One was Milan Kundera, probably the most famous of all Czech writers, and a younger writer, Vaclav Havel, who'd actually been a protege of Kundera. Havel for a while had been, you know, an aspiring writer. But he wasn't one of the most dynamic radical leaders until this catastrophe of the Soviet invasion had happened. In a series of articles, Kundera argued that Czechoslovakia should learn to live with this new reality, which, after all, was just "the Czech fate". Besides, faced with such brutal aggression, resistance seemed pointless. But for Havel, this was a deep moral betrayal of all those who were sacrificing themselves for their country's freedom. And Havel wrote back in a piece that comes out in January, against the backdrop of body counts, saying, "If we are to do our duty as creative artists, "our duty is to never accept this, "to fight back in any way we can, and when we can." In the years that followed, Czechoslovakia's new puppet leader, Gustav Husak, took his country back to the darkest periods of Stalinist control, a process he chillingly called "normalisation". With most small islands of resistance destroyed, Kundera fled to Paris. Havel, unable to write or publish, eked out a living at a local brewery, tracked at every turn by the secret police. But if all felt lost, the catalyst for resistance, both for Havel and his country, soon came from a surprising place. Rock music. This story became synonymous with one band. From 1969, all performing artists were vetted for loyalty to the new regime. So, in the 1970s, the Plastics went underground, organising secret gigs, putting them on a collision course with the authorities. In the face of what they called the "first culture", what was permitted by the regime, the band created a second culture, a place where people could be free to ignore the requirements of "normalisation". In 1976, as the gigs grew in size, the Plastics were arrested and locked up in jail. Josef got six months. And Vrata, eight. The Plastics' trial jolted Havel into action. Up to that point, the state had successfully fractured Czech dissidents into small, controllable groups. But now, in a series of secret meetings across Prague, Havel brought them all together to create one of the most provocative documents of its time - Charter 77. This was the first printed demand from anywhere inside the Communist world that called on the regime to respect the international human rights agreements they had signed. On it were the signatures of 242 brave souls - musicians, writers, intellectuals, even some of the Party members behind the Prague Spring. TRANSLATION: To me, the Charter's great success seems to be in the fact that, confronted with this document, our society gained a better awareness of its own situation. A great many people, hitherto apathetic, realised their social responsibility. Another success of the Charter is that it reinforced the idea of the indivisibility of freedom, making people of different convictions grasp that the freedom of each individual is the freedom of all. Ancl that one has to defend other people's rights. It was now Havel's turn to find himself in prison. Taken to this jail underneath state security HQ, he'd be interrogated for 18 days straight, until eventually, worn down and psychologically broken, he was forced to renounce the Charter he'd risked everything to create. He immediately knows it's the worst thing he's done in his life. He calls it "the mistake". And it haunted him for all of his life, but actually, instead of simply being broken by it and crushed by guilt, he becomes, you know, a real leader, as a result of having, by his own lights, having done wrong. H is resolution reborn, Havel thought about what the Plastics had shown him. The result was one his most astonishing pieces of writing, The Power Of The Powerless. The wonderful thing about The Power Of The Powerless is that, unlike Nineteen Eighty-Four, it doesn't end in despair. What he says is that repressive states are taking a bet that our default mode is to be obedient and apathetic, cos "I don't want to get into trouble," but he says that is actually not true. The true indiv... The true nature, our true default position, is wanting plurality, diversity. That's very high-minded. Just wanting to do our own thing with each other. Like listening to rock 'n' roll, like saying whatever the hell we feel like saying in a cafe. And he says something absolutely brilliant. The title of The Power Of The Powerless hangs on this, that the enemy is actually freaked out by it, because it's fighting the wrong war. It can't actually fight a war against someone saying whatever they want to say in a shop. Or going to music. They don't know how to deal with that. And the regime that doesn't like this imposes a regime of lies. And there's a wonderful phrase that I've got to read cos it is so right for now. "Because the regime is captive to its own lies, "it must falsify everything. It falsifies the past, "it falsifies the present, "it falsifies the future, it falsifies statistics. "It pretends to respect human rights. "It pretends to persecute no-one. It pretends to fear nothing. "It pretends to pretend nothing." And what he's saying is, actually, that actually disgusts people. And that when they get to live in truth, you're happy. And his view is that once cracks appear in the regime, this trapped oxygen of ordinary life will just go... Will just absolutely burst out. Havel called it "the politics of hope". And it's this simple idea that Nadya from Pussy Riot credits with saving her life. In 2013, she was transferred to one of the most notorious gulags in Russia, Penal Colony lK-14, in the remote region of Mordovia, with its regime of forced lab our. Making uniforms for the Russian state police, she got one day off every six weeks. I think the most dangerous territory comes when he tried to not just steal freedom from a human being, but also their personality. Ancl what happens when people have to work 16 hours a clay and perform, like, really hard physical lab our, you're being stripped of your identity because you don't have time to even figure out who you are any more. You lose, like, any sense of hope or agency or motivation. This is ultimate depression for me. Ancl what helped me to get out of there was just to actually sneak out of the factory for a second and read this essay that Vaclav Havel... How did it get there, Nadya? How did the book get there? There is a position in prison called "tzensor", and they're supposed to check everything that comes in to you. So at some point it was a lovely young lady who actually believed in me, she believed in my cause. So, yeah, Vaclav Havel and his book, The Power Of The Powerless... Right. ..was writing that we all tend to act like the emperor has clothes, but know, like... It basically takes just one person to scream that the emperor is naked, to reveal this truth. Ancl it did give me hope and it put me back on a path of regaining the meaning of my life. So do you credit the book with rescuing you at that moment? I do. Art can save people's lives. I wish Havel was here to hear you say that, really. That's very moving. For Vaclav Havel, it would take 11 years and two more prison sentences to see what he'd written about in The Power Of The Powerless finally erupt into the open. In November, 1989, eight days after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a small demonstration in the centre of Prague was viciously attacked by the state police. Two days after the bloody beating up of demonstrators, tens of thousands became 20,000, became 50,000, became 150,000. An infinite multitude of people just wanting to get their own life back, bubbling up, all that trapped air, suddenly and ecstatically being released. They camped here, shouting for Havel, and would not leave. This was the moment of the consummation of the power of the powerless. This was the Velvet Revolution. So, you're at a moment of extraordinary joy. Vaclav Havel steps out onto this balcony. And he knew at that moment, a man who often used to ask himself, "Am I doing the right thing?" That he was, in fact, absolutely right. And the world changed. I remember hearing about it and seeing the scenes, and I actually do remember this. I was crying in front of the television. I just remembered crying in front of the television. I was, yeah. Yeah, I do remember that. Why was that? It seemed as though it would never happen, you know. Between us, you know, that's why I'm so upset about what's happening right now... ...with Ukraine. We cannot afford the liquidation of democracy. Humanity, in all of its other troubles, can't afford the liquidation of democracy... ...in the name of politics as usual. Or else we'll all be sunk back into a life of lies again. I read people in the paper and, you know, online today saying, "Well, Vladimir Putin, Ukraine, it's just the way the world is, "get used to it. It's none of our business." I suppose I feel what Vaclav Havel felt when he replied to Kundera, saying, "It's always our business." Yeah, we do not want to see that die in the name of, you know, "Shut up and buy a new pair of sneakers, "and get on a plane to Ibiza, "and who gives a...toss about it?" No, I don't want to see that. I'm an old man. I don't want to die with the world selling itself down that particular crummy river. Owe it to people like Havel not to let it happen. The world of Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four ended in 1989 - so everyone said. Havel's triumph and the fall of the Berlin Wall signal led the victory of liberal democracy. The police are making no attempt to stop people. The gates have been thrown open and the elation is enormous. But it's now clear that this was wishful thinking. Democracy and free speech are, once again, under attack all over the world. The internet, once seen as a force of liberation beyond the power of authoritarian control, has now become their accomplice, the conduit of misinformation and lies. Orwell's warning about the erasure of memory and the rewriting of history... Frankly, we did win this election. ...has come back to haunt us... ...not least in China. It's a story that China's foremost artist, Ai Weiwei, knows well. He's spent his life trying to preserve the historical record in the face of China's repressive regime, most recently, in his film Cockroach that documents the battle waged by the students and citizens of Hong Kong to protect their democratic rights. The film reflects the struggle on both sides, you know, which is desperate. An cl, of course, the powerful state wins. An cl, you know, the world lost one more democratic state. Ai Weiwei inherited his mission from his father, the revered Chinese artist and poet, Ai Qing, who was punished by Mao for daring to speak truth to power. Ai Weiwei grew up in a lab our camp where his dad's job was to shovel out the communal latrines. And until he was 15, he lived with his family in a dugout. Wow. It is really a hole in the ground. Yeah. It's basically just so simple. And, you know, I happen to have kept it on my phone just to remind me how ridiculous things can be. He always believed freedom of expression is the foundation for humanity. Ancl he paid his price. CRYING, HORNS BLARING The turning point for Ai Weiwei's own career was the Szechuan earthquake of 2008. It was devastating because most of those families just have one child, you know, under this one-child policy. That's all they have for the future. They could never imagine this is the end of their...child. By now, Ai Weiwei was a famous architect and helped design the Bird's Nest stadium for the Beijing Olympics. So, as a builder, he became suspicious when it became clear that thousands of schoolchildren had died when their schools collapsed on them, like houses of cards. This is about corruption. They take all the money away. They just do not use the right concrete or right iron bars, something the state would want to cover up. The response was straight. A work of art made from 150 tonnes of steel rebars secretly collected from the rubble and painstakingly hammered back into shape... ...making something elemental from the arduous toll of restoration and accusation. The rebars mimic the lethal wave motion of the earthquake. Around the walls are listed the names of the 5,219 students who died. In the struggle with this kind of authoritarian state, I always have to question myself how I can find the right language to express my feelings. Ancl also, at the same time, to...to have a record about historical truths. Which is never easy because the most powerful thing about this authoritarian state is they always efficiently erase your memory. Ancl they distort the truth. For Ai Weiwei himself, the consequences were nearly fatal - a savage beating by the police that caused a blood clot on his brain, detention in a state prison facility for 81 days... ...and the state-sanctioned destruction of his studios. He's now in exile abroad. It's frustrating, you know, but at the same time, I always feel, "Why do they have to do that?" Only because truth in art is so hard for them. They cannot stand this will be co-exist with them. They have to destroy it. So that really makes me feel a sense of accomplishment. A lot of writers and artists now feel that all the things your father suffered so much for, and that you've suffered so much for, are right now in such peril. I can compare the situation of today is almost like... How do you say? This Titanic crisis. We are all on the same boat, the boat is comfortable, we have a great dream to take that journey. Ancl we will not know the boat will be hit by just a piece of ice. Then the whole boat is sinking down. Yeah. I suppose the brutality inflicted on artists is the ultimate backhand compliment to the power of their art, but I don't think there's anything more important for the fate of humanity than the free exercise of the informed imagination. That and the insistence that truth really does matter. So we are perhaps now at a true historical crossroads. We have to ask ourselves, well, how important is this free space that's opened up by great art and great writing? We have to ask ourselves, how much does it matter to wake up from a world of lies? Just what kind of world is it we want to live in? It seems to me it's exactly at times like these we realise what great art is really for.
