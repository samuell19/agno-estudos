He was hit by it from behind. It's not a random attack or robbery. The house hasn't been ransacked. I reckon they knew each other. Cigarette butts of Hope, Kent and Midori brands. Three people were here tonight. - And the victim's cigarettes? - He had a packet of Kent. Two visitors then, smoking Hope and Midori. The Midori has lipstick on it. Looks like the same lipstick. - Where's this from? - Lips of the corpse. He must've had some fun before being killed. What have you found? - A hair. - The victim's? - No, it belongs to a young man. - Send it to the lab. - Do you know the time of death? - About four hours ago. It's 2:00am now, so just after 10:00pm. Who found the body? It was me. My father was dead when I came home at 1:00am. Father? To the public, he was the President of Fujiyama Foods. To me, he was a money-mad womanizer in his fifties. - Did you alert the police at once? - Not really... My mind went blank for 10 minutes, like I had stage fright. - Did you touch the body? - Not at all. I didn't even want to see his dirty face. The red spider lilies were beautiful. How many in the family? Apart from dad and me, Miyuki and an old maid. Is Miyuki your sister? She's my mother-in-law. She's his second wife. Used to run a bar. A loose woman. - Where's his wife? - She's not back yet. - Still out? - Yes. She's shacked up with her lover. - Call the maid. - Yes. What do you smoke? Am I a suspect? That's a waste of time, I have an alibi. I was drinking with mates in a bar not long ago. - What do you smoke? - I smoke Peace. I go through five packs a day. - Occupation? - I'm a theater director. I'm quite famous in the industry. OK, you may go. The maid's here. What time did he come home? I guess it was around 6:00pm. Was the ashtray empty then? Yes, I cleaned it out. - Had the son and wife left? - Yes. They left after noon. So who visited here tonight? - Not sure. - You must've answered the door to them. I don't know. Why not? Many people walk through the garden and use that entrance. I wouldn't notice who comes to visit. My hearing's gone as well. It's the victim's wife, Miyuki. I'm a public prosecutor, Kido. I'm sorry, but I need you to identify him. Madam? It's my husband. I'm sure. But how did it happen? Was it a robbery? Did someone hold a grudge against him? No. I have no knowledge of such a thing. How about his business rivals? I have no idea about his business matters as I'm a mere woman. When did you leave home today? It was around 3:00pm. I came home late from the hairdresser as I visited a friend. Do you know that some visitors were here tonight? No. Seems like it was a woman. So she was here then! She's always here when I'm out. How shameless! - Who is she? - Ayako Kataoka, my husband's secretary. She must've brought the white chrysanthemums. What about the red spider lilies? I brought them. I found them walking by the river this morning. That vase? I took it out of the cupboard and displayed it there. Did he have an unusual relationship with her? Well, I'll leave it to your imagination. Which cigarette brand do you smoke? This one, Chesterfield. Stand back. You're obstructing the way! Prosecutor, are you coming to the post-mortem? Yes, I want to be thorough. COMPANY PRESIDENT KILLED AT HOME LAST NIGHT SOBU DISTRICT COURT SOBU DISTRICT PUBLIC PROSECUTORS OFFICE Thirteen fingerprints were found on the vase which probably killed him. Of these prints, four and eight belong to two women. The last one is a man's. - The victim's print? - No. It belongs to another man, just like the hair. It's an easy case. There's a murder weapon and fingerprints. I'm glad that I appointed you in charge. If you succeed in this, I'm transferring you over the river. - Over the river? - To Tokyo. - To Tokyo? - Indeed. It's a sort of passport to promotion. Good luck. Thank you, sir. We failed to get a guilty verdict in two cases recently. My reputation is on the line. I want you to secure a guilty verdict. - Good morning. - Morning. We received seven new cases this morning, two thefts, a fraud, an embezzlement, and three traffic accidents. - Is the trial for arson at 11:00am? - Yes. Bring me the report, will you? I'll visit the police in the afternoon. Good morning. It took me all night to prep for the trial. That assault case to prosecute? He was tough, but he confessed last night. You always manage that, solving all the cases. I have 200 cases due, and a messy one was just added on top. What is it? - Murder. - Excellent. Election fraud or bribery are just dead-ends. Why? Top lawyers will be assigned, unlike in murder cases. A veteran like you scared of a lawyer? It's because I am a veteran. We should get a guilty verdict on the murder case. Good for you. Hi. Where's the witness? I'm Prosecutor Kido. You must be Ayako Kataoka from Fujiyama Foods. Yes. Do you know the president was killed at home? Yes, I read it in the papers this morning. You visited him last night, right? - Yes. - What time was that? I left the office at 5:00 and arrived at his home around 7:00. - When did you leave? - About 8:00. - Can you prove that? - Yes. I left when Director Nakano arrived. Director Nakano? He is our Accounting Director. Why did you go to visit him? I went to discuss the next day's schedule. I'm his secretary. Is that all? I brought some chrysanthemums, his favorite flower. Anything else? What do you mean by that? We know you kissed him. Quit your vulgar assumptions. When did your affair begin? Stop being so idiotic. Our relationship is above board. Well, show us your lipstick, then. Why was it found on his lips? Get it out. Tsuda, seize this as evidence. So, do you admit that you were his mistress? I admit that. Were you sexually involved? I loved him very much. I wanted to kill myself when I heard about his death. - But I stopped. - Why? In order to take his revenge. - Revenge? - That's right. The killer is his wife. She did it with her lover. I can't die leaving them alive. Who's her lover? Juro Hitomi. He was the previous secretary. - He was fired when found out. - And now? - Sales Director of Fukamachi Corp. - Fukamachi Corp? It's a moneylending company in Nihonbashi, Tokyo. Is it true that they conspired? Go to the Hayashiya Inn if you doubt me. - They meet there secretly. - The Hayashiya, right. They're despicable people, killing him just for a carefree life. You should investigate them instead of me, Prosecutor. How much were you paid? I mean allowance as mistress, not salary. Didn't you hear me when I said I loved him? You think I wanted money? I felt sorry for him, being betrayed by his wife, so I comforted him with my body and soul. You wouldn't understand. STATEMENT Stamp your fingerprint if it's correct. This will stand as evidence in court. There are no lies, right? None. You may go. Four fingerprints match with the ones on the lipstick. They belong to Ayako Kataoka. - And eight prints belong to his wife? - Yes. These are taken from Miyuki Kakimoto's compact, and they perfectly match those eight prints. So, we'll have to identify the man's prints. Such a heavy vase could only be wielded as a murder weapon by a man. We should investigate Nakano and Hitomi. Bring in Nakano. Excuse me... HOPE CIGARETTES You visited him on the day he was killed. Yes. I arrived at 8:00 and left about 9:00, I think. - Can you prove it? - You can ask the company driver. What was the purpose of your visit? We used to discuss tax schemes, but there was another reason. What was it? It's hard to talk about as it brings dishonor on the company, but the president was involved in moneylending. Meaning? He'd siphoned off company funds to earn interest for three years. And the sum? He always juggled between 20 to 30 million yen. I repeatedly advised him that it was a breach of trust. - What happened on the night? - I went to collect the loan of 23 million. Because an audit is due this month. Did he return it to you? He was going to get it back from a borrower that night. Did he have enemies in the company? His autocratic management clashed with the Managing Director, but I wouldn't say he had enemies... What about his clients? His nasty business made some enemies, but murdering him is beyond me. - We need your fingerprints and hair. - Fine. Could you? Do you know a man called Hitomi? I know him indeed. I saw him that night as well, near the president's home. - Hitomi? - Our cars passed, but I'm certain. Nakano's hair doesn't match at all. His fingerprints are different, too. He's innocent. It could be Hitomi. He paid a visit that day. The moneylender is suspicious, too. He'd get to keep hold of 23 million if he killed him. Aren't you going to help us with Hitomi? Not at all. But it's the money, not the affair, that's the motive. FUKAMACHI CORPORATION OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT Mr. Hitomi, you have a visitor. How do you do? I'm from Yamada Securities. Oh, a stockbroker. Well, how about the investment trust? I'm a professional moneymaker. 5000-10,000 yen would do, instead of a drink. Our interest is better than yours. Well, thank you for your time. Thank you very much. Welcome. Welcome, sir. - Where's the toilet? - Over there. LEGAL MEDICINE LECTURE ROOM Most likely it's the same person. Really? Flat wavy hair. - And the fingerprints? - They're the same. These match exactly the ones on the weapon. Tsuda, Hitomi is guilty. Are we watching him for now? We'll interview him in Tokyo. - Are you Mr. Juro Hitomi? - Yes. I'm Prosecutor Kido. I need to talk to you. Come in. You visited president Kakimoto on November 10th? That's four days ago, right? The day he was killed. - What time was it when you arrived? - I was in Tokyo all night. Can you explain whereabouts? Well, that day... I know, I left work around 8:00 and went to a bar in Ginza. - Which one? - Botan. I stayed for two hours and came home by taxi. You remember it very well. I won't forget that night. I proposed to a bar hostess, that's why. What's her name? Tsu... Tsuneko Nakazato. Welcome. I'm Tsuneko Nakazato. What do you want? You know a Juro Hitomi, right? I know him. - Have you seen him lately? - He came to the bar. That was... I know, it was the night of the 10th. - What time? - Two hours from 8:30 onwards. What did you talk about? About getting married next Spring. Do you remember what he drank? Oh, yeah. Five glasses of whisky and soda, and three glasses of Hennessy. Are you sure? He doesn't hang around drinking beers. He drinks a lot. That's enough. I have a customer waiting for me. Hey, what's this? He only drank one whisky that night? What about all those other drinks? He asked you for an alibi, then. Right? REQUEST FOR ARREST WARRANT Tsuneko admitted she gave him an alibi. Fingerprints on the murder weapon and the hair are his. And there's a witness. Please issue an arrest warrant as he may flee. - What's the motive for the murder? - Passion. He had an affair with the victim's wife and killed the husband as an impediment. - Can you prove it? - I'm confident. Kusama, what's your opinion? Hitomi seems suspicious. If we arrest and grill him, he may confess. Let's do it. Do you have the right to arrest me? - I'm innocent. - Then why did you concoct an alibi? You didn't go to the bar on that night. Where were you? I know you can't tell us. - You were at his home. - I wasn't. Why was your hair found in his home? Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon. Hey... Why did you kill him? To be together with his wife? When did the affair begin? Save your breath. I won't talk without my lawyer present. You can use your right to remain silent. It'll all be revealed. How did you find out about their affair? Fukamachi Corp's telephone operator is my friend. They always made plans to meet over the phone. What's her name? I can't say. She'll be fired. Just like me. "Just like me"? Look. Because you helped us? They can't keep the lover of a dead president. Miyuki ordered it. What are you going to do? Never mind about me. I'll help you get employment. You're such a meddler. Don't bother. More importantly, just prove them guilty. Give them the death penalty. I'm counting on you. I'll testify. Whatever is necessary. HAYASHIYA INN The two of them come here often. The lady's the wife of the president of Fujiyama Foods, right? What's their relationship? - Meaning? - Did they stay? - Now, then... - They're no strangers. Well, two people visit an inn for a reason. - It must be an affair. - I don't know for sure. You must know a man called Juro Hitomi? He used to be my husband's secretary. When did your affair begin? Prosecutor, are you trying to insult me? There's witness testimony. That woman... Has Ayako Kataoka been telling tales about me? Don't take her story seriously. My husband and I married for love. We were happy together, and I never cheated on him. But you often met Hitomi. Because... I have 8 million yen from sales in my bar. I deposited it with Fukamachi Corp via Hitomi. - It's a great investment. - I see. That's a good excuse. Don't insult me. My husband knew all about it. He knew of your affair, so Hitomi was sacked. It was Hitomi's decision. My husband was disappointed. Hitomi's getting married to a bar hostess. He wouldn't touch an old hag like me. Your story's beyond ridicule. Miyuki and my dad stopped sharing a bed. They had separate rooms. That bitch neglected him and went out with Hitomi. And your father didn't say anything? He was intending to divorce her. Divorce? He asked many times but Miyuki refused. Dad has a 200-million fortune including stocks and property. If she stays his wife, he would kick the bucket soon. You shouldn't talk about your father like that. Haven't you finished? They're waiting for the rehearsal. I'll give you a ticket for the next performance. No need. How far was the divorce processed? Ask my dad. I have his divorce notice. See you. Right, let's begin. KAKIMOTO MACHINERY DIVORCE NOTICE I thought it was a shame when I was asked to witness the notice. His second wife is young and good-looking. - Did he write it by himself? - He did. Her signature is missing. We tried to persuade her but she was so stubborn. She didn't say "yes". Did she admit an affair with Hitomi? No way. She asked us for proof. She challenged us to produce a photo of them in bed. She's uncontrollable. - Did he change his mind on divorce? - I guess so. She even told him to divorce her if that's what he wanted, she threatened to kill him and herself. Monstrous woman, she is. She might've incited Hitomi to stop getting a divorce. Nothing was found in Hitomi's home. Any bloodstains? The results of luminol tests were all clean. He was shrewd to dispose of it quickly. Bring the witness of the theft case tomorrow. - Prosecutor Kido? - I am. I'm Yamamuro from Tokyo. Hitomi's lawyer. Go easy on me. - Are you going to prosecute him? - Of course. - Any evidence? - Yes, we have. Witness or physical evidence? - We have both. - I see. Can I read the investigation record? I'm afraid not. What about after prosecution? Trial begins with witness examination. I'll present physical evidence depending on the development. The trial will be prolonged contrary to the purpose. Anyhow, prosecutors have the right to refuse access. Unsure prosecutors tend to misuse that right. Surely I can see Hitomi? - Right now? - Indeed. You can have 15 minutes. - It takes at least half an hour. - No way. I'd settle for 20 minutes. It has to be 15! I see. Never mind. Mr. Yamamuro... I'll tell you what to say to the prosecutors. We're short of time. Remember them now. Kido, you're so unlucky. - Yamamuro's his lawyer. - And so? He's famous for being nasty. He argues ferociously and he's very sharp. Audacious as well. He's won many victories over public prosecutors. You need solid evidence. How's it going? It's mostly here, but there's not enough evidence of an affair. Everybody struggles with it. The only way is to catch them on the spot. You'll have to make Hitomi talk. Confession is always the best evidence. If he's found guilty, we'll lose all credibility. If he spills, it won't be just that. Breach of legal interest and deposits from notables will be known. Your wrongdoing will be revealed and you'll go to jail. - That's why I hired you. - I'm expensive. Good evening. Have you got money for the extension? Why are banks full of pig heads? I have no result so far. - How about the patron? - He's no use. He's merciless when it comes to money. He's not like that. He does whatever you say now. He'll lend you the money with the bank's interest. Don't fool me. Is that true? - On one condition. - What's that? Ask Yamamuro. He gave me...10 million? Don't flatter yourself. He just borrowed your name. It was simply a way to evade tax. Don't be sad. She'll give it to you as a nominee. Isn't that great? Your passbook and seal. The 10 million yen is all yours. I used to hold such resentment against you, but there's no need to be stubborn after his death. I would like us to get on well for his sake. It's disgusting. It's too late. You fired me. - That's why you need this money. - Leave me alone! I can get bar work anywhere. But I know it's very hard from my experience. Do you want to be reinstated? I can talk to the Director. After all, I've become a large shareholder. "Lawyer, Ryuhei Yamamuro"? Now I'm distributing Mr. Kakimoto's assets. I see. Then what? You owed him 5 million yen from your brother. Indeed. We subcontractors are always exploited by the clients. My dead brother was my only hope. The repayment date has expired. Will you settle? This was a formality. He was fine if I paid whenever I could. It was between brothers. But we have the credit note. If you don't pay up, we'll have to seize the factory. Why now? Is it at Miyuki's instigation? I wonder what Yamamuro's conspiring. He's persuading witnesses to testify falsely. We'll need to back the statements. - Let's start with Ayako Kataoka. - Well, she's solid. - Check the son and Nakano. - Fine. Did he confess? Not yet. I'll get the confession out of him. Want one? Confess if you want to smoke! Why don't you atone for your crime? For what I didn't do? Otherwise, punishment will be increased. It could be the death penalty. Confess if you don't want to die! I'm lenient enough to reduce your penalty. I promise. You'll feel better. - The day after tomorrow. - What? I'll be detained for 20 days and then released. Who told you about that? It's already midnight. I'll tell the lawyer if you continue. It's abuse! Come in. You wanted to see me, sir? Has Hitomi confessed? I'm sorry. He's quite tough and doesn't give up. Detainees normally confess within three days to a week. What's wrong? Is there no conclusive evidence? How about this for evidence? The borrower of 23 million yen from the deceased may be Hitomi. - Hitomi? - Yes. He visited the house often. - He went to see Miyuki. - No. Even she wouldn't meet him at home, so money was the reason. Interesting. Kido... He might've murdered him to keep the money. Check Fukamachi Corp. Well guessed. We took care of the president's money from time to time, at an annual rate of 36 percent. - Repaid? - Till the end of last month. I'll show you if you doubt it. This is the deposit receipt. - Was Hitomi entrusted with it? - Yes. I left the money handling to him. He's young but reliable. Do you always give a deposit receipt? Yes, we recover it when we repay on the second month with interest. If Hitomi had received the last repayment of 23 million, the receipt should still be at home. I guess so, but I haven't been informed. It's not here. Where else did he keep his things? He always stayed in this room. Nothing's changed in there. "I'm entrusted with your 23 million yen. "Due in three months. November 5th, 1962. Juro Hitomi." - This is it! - Yes. My theory turned out correct. The deposit note is great evidence. The motive was money then? But it could still be the affair. I'd like to push the line of two motives. His detention period ends today. I want to prosecute. What do you think, Kusama? Hitomi's probably guilty. He'll give an alibi otherwise. Good. Proceed. Can we go for the death penalty for robbery and murder? Do it. COURTHOUSE COURT No.2 - ENTRANCE FOR PROSECUTOR AND DEFENDER - Name? - Juro Hitomi. Domicile? 117 Higashi Gobancho, Sendai. Current address? 2-2305, Sugao, Toshima District, Tokyo. - Date of birth? - July 3rd, 1927. - Occupation? - Office worker. I now declare the court open for trial of the murder of Takanobu Kakimoto. The defendant had an affair with the victim's wife, Miyuki Kakimoto. As they often met up at a teahouse, Mr. Kakimoto indicated that he would divorce his wife. On November 5th, the defendant happened to be entrusted with 23 million yen from the victim. The defendant decided to keep the money and prevent Miyuki being divorced by killing him. On November 10th, he visited the Kakimoto residence at 26 Katsuragawa, Kato. While they talked in the lounge, he seized an opportunity to hit the victim's head with a bronze vase at hand, causing death due to a brain hemorrhage. He's charged with murder under Clause 199 of the Criminal Law. Does the defendant have anything to say regarding the charge? I didn't kill company president Kakimoto. Which part of the indictment is wrong? All of it. Counsel's opinion? I was going to examine the report and evidence gathered under police authority. Then I was going to prepare for the trial. But my request was flatly refused by the prosecution. Investigation was under control of the police, and we had no idea what the charges were! Our wish for a fair trial was crushed. Therefore, from what I have gathered from the defendant, I would just like to express my honest opinion against the indictment. The defendant saw Miyuki purely for business purposes, meaning that there was no affair between them, contrary to the indictment. The defendant didn't receive 23 million of illegal loans from Kakimoto either. Furthermore, he didn't kill Kakimoto. On the basis of those three points, I plead not guilty. "An oath: I swear that I shall tell the truth "and I won't hide or add anything as a witness. "Fumio Kakimoto." You'll be punished if you falsely testify under questioning. But if there's a possibility that you may be charged, you can refuse to testify. - Understood? - Yes. Are you the son of the victim, Mr. Kakimoto? I am. - Were they happily married? - Far from it. My parents fought all the time at home. Not surprising, as she married him for money. How do you know it was for money? She left my father at home and had an affair every day. Do you know who it was with? It was that man, Hitomi. What are your grounds for this accusation? They often met up at a teahouse with rooms for hire. He has a weakness for women, so he decided to get divorced for her. - Why didn't the divorce happen? - He was threatened. Threatened? By whom? By Miyuki. She threatened to kill him with a dagger if he divorced her. A dagger? She's scary, despite her meek looks. About the affair with the defendant, you only heard from your father? It must be unbearable even for a tough man to tell his son. You despise Miyuki, don't you? Nobody's grateful when their home life's wrecked. - Did you know of his affair with Ayako? - I knew. Ayako was his mistress, right? So what? If you married a woman like Miyuki, you would have one. Why did Juro Hitomi leave the company? The president found out about the affair with his wife. Why did he loan money to him? He took advantage of him to earn high interest. Explain the last illegal loan. Credit of 23 million was from Daiichi Corp, and I handed it to the president on November 1st. - Did you get the money back? - It's been missing since he died. You visited him at home on November 10th, did you? Yes, I did. What flowers were in the bronze vase then? Red spider lilies and chrysanthemums. It's strange to see red spider lilies at home, so I asked him. He said, "It's my wife, she's planning my funeral with those flowers." He was serious. - Did you see someone? - Yes. - Who? - It was Juro Hitomi. Are you sure? I passed by him in my car. It was definitely him. What was he doing? He was hurrying towards Kakimoto's. I rest the case. - Counsel? - No questions. Your honor, may we present the examination report and evidence? One: inspection record of the murder scene. Two: examination report no.1, cause of death and injuries. Three: bronze vase, murder weapon. Four: examination report no.2, fingerprints on the weapon. Five: examination report no.3, hairs from the crime scene. Six: examination report no.4, the defendant's fingerprints and hair. They prove that fingerprints and hair from the scene belong to Juro Hitomi. Seven: credit note of 23 million yen from Kakimoto to the defendant. Eight: seal used by the defendant to sign the credit note. Nine: examination report no.5, the defendant's handwriting. This proves that the credit note was written by him. Ten: Divorce notice. Eleven: examination report no.6, the victim's handwriting. This proves that the notice was written by him to divorce Miyuki. That's everything. The evidence is well prepared. It should be sufficient. Judge Ezaki takes evidence seriously, so he won't allow any small flaws. If we could spare more time, money and personnel, we could get other key witnesses. It's the prosecutors that suffer. I envy the lawyers, it's alright for them. They have time, money, and they cover one case at a time, but we work on ten cases simultaneously. And if the case proves not guilty, the papers bash us and our promotion is halted. What a pitiful existence! Such is the fate of a public prosecutor. Anyway, about your transfer to Tokyo... They want you as soon as this case is settled. - The Tokyo District Office? - Yes. - Thank you so much. - Well done. You're fortunate to be going to Tokyo after just three years. Congratulations. Were you Kakimoto's secretary? Yes. And you had a special relationship with him? Do I have to answer that? You can only refuse to testify if you may be prosecuted. Explain how you became his mistress. I... I was raped. I had no choice but to obey him. But you loved him, didn't you? I hated him... That goes without saying. You testified that your relationship was based on sympathy. This is totally different! That was the first time I'd talked to the police, so I was rather confused. I don't remember what I said. According to the record, you immediately thought that Hitomi had killed him when you read it in the papers. You knew about their affair? No. I know nothing about his wife and Hitomi. You kept cursing her and Hitomi, didn't you? I said I don't know. Like I said earlier, I was in shock in front of the police. Did you receive any money from Kakimoto? Yes. I received it at last. How much was it? 10 million yen, all in cash. When was that? November 4th. What did you do with the money? I deposited it in my account at the Asahi Bank. So you must have a passbook. Yes, it's in here. Your honor, I would like to present the passbook as evidence. Objection! It's irrelevant! According to the prosecutors, the defendant was entrusted with 23 million from Kakimoto. But he wants to deny it. The 10 million yen that the witness received may be part of that 23 million. Overruled. The witness will present the passbook. Why did he pay you such a large sum? It must be compensation for robbing me of my virginity and ruining my youth. Didn't he just borrow your name? No. He told me to open a bar or something. Why didn't you mention that when the police asked you about the money? Well, they didn't check my bank balance. Your husband asked for a divorce, didn't he? He joked about it when he got drunk. Did you love your husband? Of course, I did. A different love from when we were younger. Did you know of their affair? - Yes. - What did you do? I didn't do anything. Why was that? You don't love him enough to be jealous? His infidelity wasn't the first time. If I keep calm, he soon ends it and comes back to me. I worked in a bar, so I'm used to seeing men having affairs. What were you doing the night he was murdered? After the kabuki, I went to the Hayashiya Inn and came home about 2:00am. - The Hayashiya Inn? - Yes. You stated that you visited a hairdresser, then a friend. - Yes. - That's totally different! Actually... I was seeing Hitomi at the Hayashiya. With Hitomi? Why did you lie to the police? I didn't want to be seen as suspicious so... You're talking rubbish! Do you remember what time Miyuki arrived that night? About half ten. With the defendant? Hitomi arrived first. When did they leave? It was after midnight. Did they use your teahouse to conduct their affair? Not at all. They were always accompanied by Fukamachi. One wouldn't do such a thing in front of others. Besides, we're not some sleazy hotel. - So, it was just a business meeting? - Yes. No further questions. Are you sure Hitomi arrived at half ten? I remember it well. I had a bath after watching the 11 o'clock news. I was surprised when Hitomi burst in naked. Eleven o'clock is the busiest time for a teahouse. How come you had time for a bath? It happened to be a quiet night. Were you consulted by the victim on divorce? Yes. You were the witness? Yes. Why did he decide to divorce? My brother never considered getting a divorce. Then why did he fill in the divorce notice? To fool his secretary. To fool her? What do you mean by that? Hinting at divorce works well on young women. Showing a divorce notice around was his modus operandi. It occurred so often that I paid no attention. You knew that their marriage was going through difficulties. Yes, but he spoke ill of his wife to hide his awkwardness. Having a wife of his daughter's age made him self-conscious. How's your factory doing? I'm struggling these days. Have you ever borrowed money from your brother? Objection! The question is irrelevant. Counsel is trying to find the missing 23 million, therefore I think it's fully relevant. Witness, please answer the question. He was my only lifeline and frequently lent me money. Tell us about your recent situation. I borrowed five million yen from him on November 3rd. That prevented a bad overdraft. No further questions. Your honor, I present the statements of Ayako Kataoka, Miyuki Kakimoto and the victim's brother. - Counsel's opinion? - No objection. But we believe that the testimony of a witness in the trial is more credible than the statements taken by the prosecutors. It's a daring alibi, him seeing Miyuki at the time of the crime. But we have Hitomi's fingerprints and hair from the scene. His alibi won't stand. We should be fine. Yamamuro will come up with something else for sure. Now that the 23 million has been located, we can discount the motive of money. But even if he gave Ayako ten million and his brother five million, it's short eight million of the total 23 million. Yamamuro will concoct some far-fetched story. - Where's Tsuda? - He's making enquiries about your case. We're short of personnel here, too. An investigation should end with arrest. He's too old school for us. Kido. - How was it? - Well... Ten million was definitely deposited in Ayako's account on November 4th. The Hayashiya Inn registered "Miyuki Kakimoto plus one" on the 10th. Not sure if it's Hitomi or not. Tsuda... did we fail in our investigation? Don't be pessimistic. Persist in what you believe. Hitomi's definitely guilty. On November 5th, you were entrusted with 23 million yen from the president. No, I wasn't. You wrote this credit note. Take a look. He phoned me that day, saying that he had 23 million yen for me, so I should come to collect it. I made preparations and visited him, but I was told to wait a few days. You raised the credit note without receiving the money? I forgot to pick it up as I got drunk on whisky. Where was this? It was at the table in the lounge. It was found in the back of a picture frame in the study. It's worthless without a transaction. - Surely he'd keep this safe? - One would think so. You received the money! That's the truth. Where's the 23 million yen? Please strike from the record, your honor. This is the prosecutor's presumption and not an argument. Sustained. You burst into the bath at the Hayashiya Inn on that night? That was rude of me. - Were you clothed? - No. - Where did you disrobe? - In the changing room. - How large is the room? - About 10 feet square. So you should've noticed her presence unless the lights were out. I was really cold and in a hurry to soak in the hot water. You asked the bar hostess for an alibi for that night, didn't you? Yes. You made her say that you were there till 10:30, right? Yes. It would appear suspicious if our meeting was discovered... Then you went to Kakimoto's house before 9:00. I went to the Hayashiya Inn. So why was your hair found on a chrysanthemum at the crime scene? And your fingerprints, too! It was the day before when I touched the vase, the 9th not the 10th. You think we believe that? It was brought out in the morning and the chrysanthemum was arranged in it that night. Well, I'm certain in my mind. Ask Ayako Kataoka, if you doubt it. I met her there when I left. Ayako Kataoka? Your honor, we'll call her back as a witness if the police are in doubt. For what purpose did you touch the vase? Red spider lilies are special flowers to me. They have memories for me. My father was a junior civil servant. I lost him in a car crash when I was in high school. I cried clinging to his body. Those flowers were around his neck as red as blood, swaying in the wind. I see his face in death when I see those flowers. I remember touching the vase that day as I thought about him. Perhaps my hair fell out then. Did you have any affection towards Miyuki? Not at all. I'm in love with Tsuneko Nakazato. We're engaged to be married. How do you feel about the death of Kakimoto? It's very unfortunate. I had great respect for president Kakimoto. He said he would back me when I started up my business. I cannot believe that such a fine person was murdered. No further questions. You visited Kakimoto at home on the night, didn't you? Yes. And you brought the chrysanthemums? No. It was the previous day when I brought them. I bought ten stems in Ueno. Your statement says you brought them on the night of the 10th. Which is true? It was the 9th. - The 10th, right? - No, the 9th. What time? It was between two and three in the afternoon. For what purpose? Same as on the 10th. Enough of this nonsense! Well, that's the truth. I went shopping in Ueno on the 9th, and I bought the chrysanthemums by the station. I was working at the office on the 10th so I couldn't have gone shopping. Why are you falsely testifying? You're under oath! Aren't you ashamed? You may be giving a false account as a favor for someone. But you can rectify that! Tell us the truth! Your honor, the prosecutor's remark is an insult to the witness. Please overrule it. Objection sustained. We call the owner of the flower shop in Ueno as a witness. It was certainly on the 9th. - Are you certain? - Yes. It was registered in the book. I remember her because she was a very beautiful woman. No further questions. Prosecutor's closing arguments. Motives for the crime were money and the affair. The defendant insisted on 23 million, that the victim give away 10 million to Ayako and five to his brother. But I suspect that these payments are not part of the 23 million. With regards to the affair, it's unthinkable that a president's wife would see a man for business at night. The defendant's alibi relies on his lover, his current boss, and the proprietress of the inn, who are intimate with him. It's not credible. As for the testimony that Ayako brought flowers on the 9th, she's lying, in order to keep 10 million yen which was in her name. It's absolutely false! Therefore, prosecutors firmly believe that the crime of murder was undoubtedly carried out by the defendant. On the basis of those grounds and relevant laws, we demand the death sentence for the accused. Your turn, Counsel. The purpose of this trial is to reveal the truth with evidential support, but the police presume an act of crime using their imagination. If you think the 15 million yen and the 23 million are separate, I would like you to produce the evidence. Furthermore, if you say Miyuki is the defendant's lover, I'd like you to prove it. And if you think Ayako and the inn proprietress falsely testified, establish the facts, please! Discussing a crime without producing evidence is not a trial. It's a mystery or something straight out of a detective story! Your honor, the proprietress' account concerning the bath and the defendant's testimony about his father, both are vivid and detailed. Why? That's because they're telling the truth. If they were making false testimony, they would've appeared unnatural and weak. And the defendant's fingerprint on the weapon was singular. If he had smashed the victim's head with it, more fingerprints should be present on it. This means that the prosecutor's arguments lack any evidence. Therefore, the counsel's plea is that the defendant is not guilty. What kind of woman are you? As you can see, I'm just an ordinary woman. I trusted you, for not being blinded by money! Sorry to disappoint you. Wait! Please, tell them the truth! - I will. - Will you? - On one condition. - What is it? Will you marry me? I'm an ex-mistress. No? Then I won't speak. A single woman needs money to live. - But... - Kido. It's not good to torment this poor woman instead of me. You should know, as a lawyer, that the law is to protect order! You've just run roughshod over the crime. How's your conscience? You should remember, Kido, that going to trial is like sport, and the strong side wins. Power and skill decide the result. Let's go. I'll drive you back to Tokyo. It was supposed to be simple. I was too naive to appoint young Kido. I think Kido did extremely well, but the lawyer was too good. Such a crafty lawyer doesn't usually deal with such a straightforward case like this. Changing the dates by buying false testimony in order to negate our evidence is aggressive... and brilliant. - Can we win? - I'm not sure. Trusting a statement or testimony at the trial is up to the judges. It's unfortunate we have no confession. I apologize. For what? Well, I failed to corroborate the evidence, so they were able to testify falsely. I should've investigated the guy from the flower shop. You did great work. You were the only one running around for me. I was the one who failed. I trusted Ayako Kataoka too much. Women really are monsters. I'd forgotten that prosecutors should suspect everyone. Maybe I'm not cut out to be a prosecutor. I wonder if he'll be found guilty. I trust the judges. They'll find out the truth. Let's relax and have a drink. All rise! I declare the court open. Defendant Juro Hitomi, step forward. I hereby deliver the verdict. The defendant is found not guilty. The reason: the motive of the crime... Well, honey? ...although it was to avoid returning the deposit of 23 million yen... I acknowledge my complete failure. I apologize. But we cannot do nothing. Please appeal. Trial is not a battle of willpower but a battle of facts. It's no use appealing without new evidence. I'll find it. One of the clues is the deposit. If you can find that, we can revive motive for money. And a new witness. If we find that someone saw Hitomi at the crime scene, we can overturn the verdict. Very well, I'll take revenge! Otherwise I'll go crazy! Are you still here after all you've done? - Get out! - No! Do it again. There's someone to see you. Not now! Send them away. Very well. Otherwise I'll go crazy! He said no. He's too big-headed. Having bought this place, he must be feeling like a king. He bought it? For how much? About 8 million yen, including refurbishment costs. How did he find such money? He said he blackmailed his stepmother. Are you sure? He was bragging about it when he got drunk. When was that? You can't convict a villain, but you can question a good citizen? You don't make sense. Is that so? I'm the victim here. Your incompetence will reward Miyuki 100 million yen. I heard you threatened her for money. Don't be silly. I was never given a penny. What about the 8 million for that place? - That was from my dad. - Liar! What did you hold over her? Well? Did you have evidence of their affair? Photos of them in bed? Or recordings on a hidden mic? What are you talking about? You threatened Miyuki, so she consulted Hitomi. Hitomi gave some of the 23 million from your father to her, and she gave it to you, right? Hitomi was asked to repay the 23 million, so he killed your father. In a way, you killed your own father! Tell the truth, atone for your crime! Your testimony will be decisive for the appeal and it'll prove Miyuki's complicity. You'll inherit his 200 million yen. Tell us. Don't be a fool. I'd be charged with intimidation if I spoke up. Who told you that? Yamamuro? No... The 8 million was given to me by my father. All I have to do is check with your bank. Fumio said that I gave him 8 million yen? What a despicable child. It sounds like one of his scripts. So how do you explain this cheque? Oh, this? It's from my late husband. So why is it in your name and paid from your account? My husband and I were very close. What's his was mine, and what's mine was his. Our finances were shared. Excuse me, I'm in a hurry. That's not what we agreed. You promised me the whole 10 million. Did I? Don't play ignorant. You gave me one tenth of it, a million yen. I won't let you get away with it. Are you threatening me? You'll regret this. I'll tell everything to the prosecutor. Whatever you like. You think I won't? You can tell him whatever you like, but you'll be arrested for perjury. Go ahead if you want to go to jail. I dunno... I didn't see anything. Thanks. Sorry to keep you waiting. Here are today's new cases. One robbery. One theft. Two fraud cases and two car accidents. - Sir, can I take today off? - Any reason? It's the last day of the appeal on the company president murder case. - I want to find a witness. - That's a job for the police. I understand that, but Tsuda alone may not find them in time. You're behind on your work lately. How many cases are you holding? About 300 cases. The year ends soon. You should sort them out. I beg you. I don't want to give up on this case! How did it go? No one. How about you? No results. Seven hours left till midnight. Our fight begins now! - Shall we eat? - We're wasting time! Excuse me. - What is it, at this hour? - Sorry to disturb you. Have you seen him? The guy who murdered that company president, right? Did you see him on the night in question? No. - Did you know he was found not guilty? - He wasn't the murderer? He's the perpetrator. But he'll be acquitted unless a witness appears by midnight tonight. - Do you know anyone who may know? - Not sure... May I have a glass of water? Hey, bring some water. - There you go. - Thanks. You must be tired. Why don't you tell them? Really? You know something? Please tell us. - Do you have a reason you can't? - Not at all. We're struggling to make ends meet. Hitomi lent us some money at a high interest rate, but we can't make the repayments. Hitomi... Right then, I'll tell you. I kept my mouth shut, fearing he may put us out of business. I was walking through a school playground that night. - What time was it? - Well, it was just after midnight. About the time of the crime. Was it really Hitomi? No doubt. He came here to demand payment every week. What's the matter? We've found a new witness to start the appeal process. There's only one hour left. It's too late. Tokyo informed us today of the decision not to appeal. What? Hitomi was acquitted. But there's a new witness. Hitomi will be found guilty. Time's up. - Can't we make an extraordinary appeal? - No use. The decision is based on wrong facts, but it's not against precedent. Can we ask for a retrial? You know it happens only when it's beneficial to the defendant. This is the opposite. But we can't let them get away with... That's the law. We have to accept our failure. Sir, is that really the law? - I... - Kido. Actually, your transfer has been decided. Not to Tokyo. The High Prosecutors Office sees it as your fault. I'm sorry, but you're going up north to Aomori. Aomori? Come in. I wanted to thank you for your guidance. - I'm leaving for Aomori. - I see. Well, be patient for a few years. - I'll recall you in good time. - Yes, sir. Everyone has experienced a failed conviction. Failures make you grow. It's certainly taught me. But I won't be defeated by Yamamuro again. I shall win. See you later. Mr. Kido... Arrest me for perjury. Arrest Hitomi and Miyuki, too. I was a fool. The case is closed. Wait! Just go home. Go home! I'll hit you if you don't! - I'll knock you down! - Kido... leave her with me. I'll indict Yamamuro for perjury. You can be sure that I'll bring down Hitomi and Miyuki. I trust you. Tsuda... I'll keep a close watch over this. I'll arrest them and make them suffer. I'm counting on you. You're like a son to me. Come back soon. It gets lonely as you get older. - Tsuda... - What? I think I can trust people again. No, I'm still naive! Well, take care. THE END
