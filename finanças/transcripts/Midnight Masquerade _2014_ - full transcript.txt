(car horns) (sirens chirping) (tires screeching) - Whoa! - (driver): Watch it, buddy! - Here you go. - Ah! Cavalry. What is this? - Coffee? - What's in it? - Uh-- - It isn't stevia. - No, they were out. - Rob, if you're gonna do something nice, get it right. - Yes, Captain. - It's "Major" to you. I've been promoted. - Nice. Very seasonal. - Now not one person's put a tip in there all day. - There you go, Major. - As you were. - Trick or treat, Sam. Morning, Enid. - Hi, Mr. Carelli! - Let me guess, you're late because you stopped to buy Sam coffee again? You can stop now. I've already awarded you the "nicest guy in the office" award. - I like him. - Why? - He's honest. - Oh, my! - Emmett! - Mm? - Elyse Samford is coming in next week to discuss a trademark infringement suit. That's the file. I want precedents cited, t's crossed, i's dotted. - Who's Elyse Sanford? - Samford! With an "m". The new CEO of Samford Candy! One of our biggest clients. I don't care if you have to work on that all weekend. Put 150% into that. - Absolutely, Dad. I will dedicate myself entirely to this all weekend long and cancel all my other plans. You got it! All over it! Sanford... Samford. - Yes! - Andrew. - Hey. - Dad wants precedents cited on these by Monday. Make sure you cross the i's and dot the t's. - This weekend? No, no, no. I'm playing golf with-- - I don't care if you're golfing with all four living ex-presidents. Handle this. (frustrated sigh) Chin up, Rob. - So, Rob, how's it going? - Busy. - Busy, yeah. - And yet your billable hours aren't even near the goal we set at your last year-end review. - I sort of felt the number you set wasn't realistic given the actual number of hours in a day. - Oh, Rob, Rob, Rob... I see I'm going to have to help you succeed despite yourself. There you go! - Let me guess. Covering for Emmett and Andrew? - Can you get me everything you have on Samford Candy? - You want me to stay late with you? - No reason for your evening to be ruined, too. - Hang in there. Maybe one day you'll get to live the dream, too. You never know. (both laughing) (phone ringing) - Ruby! - [Hey, Uncle Rob!] - Hey, sweetie. - [Ready for some bowling?] - Well, that's um, kinda the thing... I can't make it tonight. - [Don't stand me up!] [You're my only uncle.] - Uh-huh, I realize I'm your only uncle. - [I'm not taking no for an answer.] - Okay, okay! I'll come. You ever think about being a lawyer yourself or has hanging around me totally turned you off of it? - Oh-oh! Ruby Cole in the house! You owe me pizza! With sausage and mushrooms. - Girls your age don't eat mushrooms. - I'm precocious. - I'm well aware of that. Just because you got a strike doesn't mean you're gonna beat me. - Just 'cause you're a guy doesn't mean you're gonna beat me. Kelly Kulick-- - Won the PBA Tour title against a man in 2010, I know. - Your feet got ahead of your swing. - Really, Dad? 'Cause I think I've beaten you two games to one today. - It's called a head start. (both laughing) - Excellent bowler! - You know what? They say the strength in the wrist diminishes with age. I think I'm gonna get you a wrist guard for your next birthday. (laughter) - Highly unlikely, my dear. Highly unlikely. - Want me to go talk you up to her? She's with her dad. - You've got to stop trying to fix me up. I'm doing fine. - Ah! La-la-la-la... - You're killing me, dad! Give me a break! No, seriously, I need a break. Do you want a snack? - No, I think I'm just gonna stay here and gloat. - You haven't had a date since that lawyer lady closed the file on you. - I'm good. I've just been busy. I'll meet someone when I meet someone. - Hey, can I get a candy bar? Thanks. - Hi. - Hey. Buying some candy? - Yep. - Which one are you gonna get? - My favorites. (chuckles) - Ruby! - Just so you know, he's single and a lawyer. Very successful. - Impressive. You must be very proud. - I am. - Hey. - Hi! Nice kid you've got here, Ray. - She sure is, but that's not-- - Got great taste in candy. - What? - Come on! You had such an opportunity and you just wasted it! - Really? - It's always good to get you out of the office. Those two guys at work still giving you a hard time? - Their daddy's the boss. - I wish I could cast a spell on them. - Excellent idea! - But I mean, you're a cool guy, so why do they have to treat you like that? - When you're the low man on the totem pole, everyone else gets to stand on top of your head. - You're too nice. - You can't be too nice. - Yeah, you can. (insects chirping) - Hi! - Here she is. Safe and sound. - Can Uncle Rob hang out with us, Mom? - Sorry, gotta get back to work. - You know it's very important I spend time with appropriate male role models. - That's why I just took you bowling, buddy. - I'm almost finished with your Halloween costume. Do you want to come try it on? - See you next week, Uncle Rob. - Bye. - Thank you. - My God, it's just so awesome! (sigh) (groaning) - Stevia. - Attaboy! Worked all weekend again? - No. - Really? What did you do? - For one thing, I went bowling. - Ah, impetuous youth! (chuckling) You, sign in. - Are you kidding me? You see me every day! - Sign in. - Do you have any idea what dealing with you is like? - Disturbing and frustrating? - Yeah, on a good day. - Thank you. - Make sure to have the restrooms cleaned, spotless. Yes, get to work. Send those to the third cubicle. - What's going on? - Uh, Samford Candy. Something about some trademark infringement lawsuit. - Oh, that explains my weekend... or lack thereof. Any inside info? - Howard Samford is retiring and handing the company over to his daughter Elyse. She's a Princeton grad. No dummy, but not a lot of practical experience. - Merry, you are a fount of information. - Awesome! Good work, people! Nice! Hi. Did you put 150% into that? - Always do. - Excellent. Well, this is a major client. You should feel very pleased that I trust you enough to allow you to work on this. - Just spending time with him is privilege enough. - Carelli! Look, when Ms. Samford gets here I want you to join us in the conference room, okay? Just me and the boys looks a little too nepotistic. You can talk, just not much. - Yes, sir. (phone ringing in the background) - Samford... Elyse Samford... Ooh! - Ms. Samford! - Hey. - Mr. Samford! - Hi. - Mr. Higgins is waiting for you, but can I get you anything before I take you back? - I'm okay. - Nothing for me, thank you. - Alright, please have a seat. It will just be a moment. The Samfords are here. Yes. - Oh, I'm sorry. I never had to wear heels when I was working in the field. I'm only good for about an hour. - Alright. (beeping) Yes? Alright, thank you. Alright, we'll be meeting in conference room one, if you'll follow me. - Hello, Elyse. Nice to see you! How are you? Howard, this is a surprise! - Carter, always. - Please sit down. - Nice to meet you, Ms. Samford. - You know, you look familiar. - Really? - Wait a minute. It was last week, at the Sustainable Harvest conference, right? - Oh! Yes, yes, absolutely! Are you into organic gardening too? - Yeah, I am up to my elbows. (chuckling) - Wonderful. - (Rob): Sorry I'm late. - Oh my gosh, small world! Um... Ray, right? With the adorable daughter? - We sort of met already. Rob, not Ray. - No, but your shirt-- - Vintage. And she's my niece. Not married. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you as well. - Before we get started, I just want to take this opportunity to officially introduce you to Elyse. She's been working with Samford Candy since high school, has her MBA at Princeton. I feel very confident that she's going to be picking up where I'm leaving off and taking the company to new heights. It's time for a generational change at Samford Candy. Meet the new boss. (chuckling) - Well, I will be looking to Higgins and Sons for the same wise guidance you've given my father over the years. And trust me, I know that everybody thinks that I just got this job because I'm the old man's daughter... Which would be exactly right. But that's what happens in a family-owned company, right, "and Sons"? (all laughing) So I just want to make it clear. I'm a collaborative person and I look forward to us working together. So let's get started. - It looks as though you're being greeted with trial by fire. What we have on the table here is a trademark infringement on Samford Candy by the Kraus Candy Company. - They've changed their name to Sanford. Emmett? - Now, by using the name Samford, with an "m" like Uncle Sam, it has a distinct similarity to Sanford, with an "n". - The other way around. - Right, whatever. They're about the same thing. - Which would be the point of the suit. - Yes. By using the name Sanford and similar packaging, the consumer is being led to believe that they are purchasing a product made by Samford. Now, on the left, Samford, as you know. On the right, Sanford. - This seems like a potential profit opportunity for us. How much are we looking at? - They don't stand a chance. - Yeah, we'll need to seek an injunction. - An injunction, damages, punitive damages, costs and fees. That could be a lot of money. - How much are we talking? - Before we get ahead of ourselves, there is potentially a much larger problem. Sanford has been cybersquatting. This needs to be addressed immediately. - As I pointed out to you before the meeting, thanks for bringing that up. - No one has registered - Dot everything, sir. I am on it. - By the way, Emmett, nice piece of work there. - Our clients deserve our full attention. if that means me missing out on a weekend or a bunch of sleep, so be it. - Andrew will be taking point on this. - Of course, dad. - Wonderful. Well, thank you all for your hard work. I fell Samford is well taken care of. And Rob, good job jumping on the cybersquatting. - My pleasure. - This case is our top priority, Ms. Samford. - That's good to hear. We do have the annual Halloween Ball coming up, as you may know. It would be a shame to have this hanging over our heads. - Just leave it with us. - Terrific. Well done, as always. - Nice to see ya, Howard. - Thanks, Carter. Thank you. - (Howard): Gentlemen. - Pleasure as always, sir. - She's amazing. Smart, beautiful, funny. - Rich! - She sounds perfect. When are you asking her out? - Not sure how ethical that would be while representing her. - I think that only applies in divorce cases. (phone ringing) Who are you texting? - Boss' son. He's dropping some work off for me. - Again? - Yeah. - Are you... Another round, darling, please. - Coming up. - Do you want us to verbally lacerate him? - I would love you to. But don't. - Okay, so when you ask her out, tell her to bring a rich friend of hers so that I can... Please set me up with a rich... - I wouldn't think you have time to be sitting around here, Rob. - My plate was totally clear when I left the office. - Look, Rob... You want to succeed with our firm? You gotta come in earlier and stay later than everybody else. Alright? You gotta clean out your plate, and then you take a look around and say, "What else can I do? What can I take off of Andrew's plate? What can I take off of Emmett's plate?" You don't just want to be adequate, alright? You want to be exceptional. - When do you need this? - Bright and early. As a matter of fact, you are not gonna have time to finish this. Mmm! See you in the morning. - Oops! (glass shattering) - Rob! - I'm so sorry. - He is so sorry. - You shut up. - You are mean. - Can I just ask one question? - Massive student loans, bad economy, and no one's hiring. Bye, guys. - Thanks, Rob. That's too much! - Morning, Sam. - FYI, your boss is a tool. - Which one? I have three and they're all tools. - Tall. Dark. Skinny. - Emmett. What did he do? - Asked me to find a new job because the sight of me depresses him. - He actually said that to you? Sam, I'm really sorry. - Are you kidding? It made my day! (chuckling) - Energy drink in your coffee? - Attention, everyone! Attention! Ms. Samford here has a very exciting announcement for the office. - Hey, everyone! As new CEO of Samford Candy, this year I have decided to invite the entire firm to our annual Halloween Ball! (cheering) So please come. Wear a costume, but none of this wearing a suit and saying you're dressed as a lawyer. (laughter) I'll see you all at the ball! (indistinct chatter) (birds chirping) Hey, Dad! - Hi there! Nice to see you. Crazy day! - So do you think you can handle slumming it for a while? - Well, it beats plaster dust and power tools, banging and crashing. (sighing) - You're lucky that you have a daughter with a spare bedroom to help you with your renovation habit. - I sure am! - (laughing): Coffee? - Crazy not to. - Do you want to know who I'm gonna be for Halloween? - Who? - Kelly Kulick. - No one's gonna know who that is. - People aren't gonna know one of the greatest bowlers of all time? - I'm thinking no. - Well, I'll know and it will be cool. Only trick or treating all night with a heavy bowling ball might be tough. - You could make one out of Styrofoam and paint it. - My mom can make me one. What about you? Are you gonna do that "I'm not wearing a costume because adults should dress like adults on Halloween" thing again? - Actually, I'm wearing a costume this year. - Truth? - Yeah. I'm going to a Halloween ball given by Samford Candy and I hear they have some pretty amazing things in their gift bags, some of which might even go to you. - You are getting in a costume and going to a Halloween party? What the heck happened to you? - Man to man? Man to girl... - I'll never tell. Mom! Uncle Rob is in love! - That's not what I said! - He's going to this big fancy ball she's throwing and he asked for a costume. - Don't you know my kid has the biggest mouth in town? - I do not! - Mm-hmm... - Give me a break! I just told my mom! - Are you really gonna wear a costume? I haven't seen you get dressed for Halloween since you were about ten. - I know. I was a vampire cowboy three years running before I decided I hated costumes. What am I gonna wear and not feel like an idiot? - I will make something for you. Let's get you measured. - I can't believe you! - What? - Alright... - You don't have to do this. I can buy something. - When your sister makes costume suits for a living, I don't think so. 32. So... What is going on? How serious are you with this girl? 17. - Ruby's a little premature. I haven't even asked her on a date yet. - Oh. Well, what do you want to go as? Pirate? Gangster? - How about the prince of the uncles? - (laughing): 40. I don't know what kind of prince that would be, but what about a regular prince? Rob, stop moving. - Okay. - I'm speechless! - Dad, I was thinking... We should try and move the company forward by making it more environmentally friendly. - I'm listening. - So if we use plant protein instead of animal whey protein, it's better for the environment and it makes our candy safe for vegetarians. - It might raise costs. - But I was thinking, if we publicize our company as a family-run company who cares about the world, who cares about our consumers, we might be able to step up profits and offset those increased costs. What do you think? - I think you're going to be the most beautiful woman at that ball. - I mean about my idea. - The smartest, with the most beautiful ideas. - It's not gonna be the same at the ball without you. - This ball is going to be your night. My being there would just detract from that. (chuckling) (sighing) - Okay, let me clean up and then we're going dancing. - Dancing? Why? - Because you're going to a ball and as I recall from your prom, you're a terrible dancer. - It's Sunday night. Doesn't she have school tomorrow? - It's 7 o'clock. What time do you think I go to bed? - Homework? - Let's go. You need to have some fun. - I went bowling. I had food that doesn't come in a paper bag. I already had fun. - You are going as the last male figurehead of the Carelli family. You need to represent. ♪♪♪ - Is this the waltz? - Yes. What else could it be? Alright... Lift your hand. Like that. Okay? Let's see what you've got, little bro. (both laughing) Sorry! You are worse than I remember. - Can we go now? - If you can walk, you can dance. The waltz starts with the box step, okay? You know the box step? - Uh... - Okay. Ruby, come and show your uncle the box step. I will be you, but better. (chuckling) Are you ready? - Yeah. - You never said anything about turning. (both laughing) - Are you gonna let a 12-year-old show you up? Come on! Come here! Alright, thanks. Basic... box step. - (both): One, two, three... One, two, three... - Now look up. And stop moving your lips. - Okay. (laughter) You're doing a lot better! You haven't stepped on my feet in a couple of minutes. (both laughing) Well, here's the secret. Dance like you're one person. - Sure, yeah! One person with three left feet; two of them mine. I am going to have blisters on my feet. - Toughen up, buttercup. - Do you want some tea? - I gotta get home. It's late. - Who are you, Cinderella? - Yes, and you're my fairy godmother. I still have work to do. Can you wave your magic wand and make it disappear? - Sure thing. (chuckling) - Practice. (humming) - Ladies. (sighing) - A lot. - Yeah. - Eight o'clock! Oh no! Okay... - Hey, pal! - Sorry. - (woman): Taxi! - No coffee today, sorry. - You look terrible. They're taking advantage of you, pal. You need to start standing up for yourself. - What I need is to keep my job. (video game sounds) - Andrew! Where's the trademark infringement filing? - The...? - The Samford trademark infringement. - I gave it to Rob. - I assigned it to you. - I just gave it to him to cross the t's and dot the i's. Dad, he doesn't earn his money around here. He sits around all day doing nothing! Definitely not putting in 150% like I am. - Carelli! Carelli? - I think he just stepped out. - Sir? - What does your watch say, Carelli? - 10:15. - 10,000. - I don't understand. - That's how many attorneys lost their jobs at major firms this year. Did you know that? - I... I didn't. - How would you like to make it 10,001? - No, sir. - Mr. Carter, Mr. Carelli is always here before everyone else. I'm sure he had a good reason. - A lot of legal secretaries out of work too. - She had nothing to do with this. - My sons can't be expected to do everything themselves. Someone has to help with the heavy lifting. - I realize that. - Pattern yourself after them. - I will. Thanks for your understanding. - I think you should stay until 10:15 tonight. Maybe dot some i's, cross some t's. - Want me to stay with you? - No, I got it. - Yeah... I think I'm gonna stay with you. - Still working? - I'm just going over the quarterly projections. What do you think about if we go into gum or breath mints? - I think you're in charge of the company now. It's your baby. (small laugh) - Right. - Hey, I wouldn't have put you in charge, CEO, if I didn't think you could handle it. You're worried about this trademark business? - No. No, I know we're in the right. - When was the last time you had some fun? - I have fun. - It's a very evasive answer. - Okay, every time we go bowling, I have fun. (sighing) (small laugh) - Beautiful night, isn't it? - Yeah, I guess so. - That fall snap is in the air and the leaves are turning. Wouldn't you rather be taking a walk with your guy than sitting here buried behind your computer? - Dad, you've entrusted me with a huge responsibility and I just want to live up to it. - You know, when your mother was alive, I tried as best as I could to manage both the company and a life with her. And after she died, I kind of lost myself in the work. No fun, no friends... I never fell in love again. Now that I'm retired, I intend to change all that. - Good. - Lysie, don't make the same mistake I did. When you're old and it's cold, you're gonna want company. Not a company. (sighing) (sighing) - Hey, Rob! Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Yeah, looks good. How many billable hours would you say this represents? - 25, minimum. - Wow! That's great! - Thanks. - Of course, as lead attorney, I'll be billing those. You really need to get your client base broadened, Rob. This firm needs more rainmakers! Maybe work up a business development pitch and I'll take a look at it. Chin up! (groaning) - What happened? Are you okay? - I just dropped something. All good. - Sanford's entire concept was based on appropriating the worldwide recognition, good will and success of Samford Candy, in a... In a, um... In an intentional effort to cause confusion in the general public between Sanford and Samford candies. Defendant's actions constitute trademark infringement in violation of Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C., section 1114. - Anything else? - Uh, yes, Your Honor. We'd like to ask for a temporary injunction until the time that this matter is adjudicated. - So ordered. Nicely prepared, young man. - Thank you. - Thank you, Your Honor. No point in doing something unless you're gonna do it right. Right? - Good morning. - Boom! Crushed it! - Yeah, sure did. - Oh, wait till I tell Elyse how I dominated! - You're meeting with Elyse? - Yeah. She asked for a full report on the court appearance, so I'm gonna explain to her in detail everything I did. - That should be interesting. - Yeah, maybe you should... You know, come to the meeting too; just to take notes or whatever. (sighing) (whistling) - What's going on? - I'm meeting with Elyse Samford. - You've got it bad! - That obvious? (chuckling) - Mm-hmm! - And then I filed for trademark infringement and got a temporary injunction to stop Sanford until the case can be heard. - What about the domain name? - Uh... Rob, why don't you read from your notes what I told you about that? - Um... That is covered under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, which need to be taken up in Federal Court. We filed on that as well. - Exactly. We've got you covered. - Okay, great. Well, Andrew, thank you. I feel like I'm in great hands. And thank you, Rob not Ray. - You're good with names. - I'm sure Ms. Sanford has better things to do with her time than to make chitchat with you, Carelli. - Samford. - You're good with names, too. - Uh, let me walk you to your car. - Sure. - Bye, Ms. Samford. - Oh, call me Elyse. - So what do you drive? I got an M3 convertible. - Oh, I have a chauffeur. - Fabulous! - See you tomorrow, Sam. - What's wrong with you? You look like your best friend just died. Which would be me and I'm still alive and kicking. - You ever feel like what's the point? - No. No, I am constantly clear on the meaning and gift of life, my friend. I'm what you'd call a committed optimist. - I guess I'm just tired. Sorry. - Well, take a load off, then. Come on, sit down. And quit apologizing all the time. I'm the guy with the meaningless job. Too many hours, not enough overtime. But if you want to feel sorry for yourself, go right ahead. - So what's your dream, Sam? - What? - What would make you happy? - Alright, I'll tell you. But if you're only asking me just to get me to ask you, forget it. (small laugh) - You don't have to ask me. Do you ever think about a woman? - No, not since '98. - What happened in '98? - I became a realist. - 'Cause there's this woman-- - No, no, not listening. No, no. - She-- - I'm not listening. - Fine. - Man, you give up easily! No wonder you're striking out in the romance department. Alright, here. I'll get you started, okay? She's absolutely beautiful, right? - Beautiful, smart. - And? - Powerful. She's the CEO of Samford Candy. - And? - And she seems kind and sort of vulnerable. - So what's the problem? - The problem is that she's way above my level. - So what? You want to be on her level? Grow. - She's the head of a mega corporation, Sam. I'm a lawyer. It's a lot of growing. - Nothing you can't overcome. All you gotta do-- - Carelli! What do you think you're doing? - Um... - Young man, you represent this firm. I don't ever want to see you lounging like this again. - That's my friend you're talking to! - I beg your pardon? Stay out of it. Step it up, Carelli. - Thanks for trying. - Forget it. Hey, Rob. I know these guys are working you like a dog around here, but you gotta make time to interact with the outside world. That's where the new clients come from. And that is what's gonna make you a rainmaker, my friend. It will also get these other clowns off your back. - So you're a lawyer now? - Used to be. You get one question. - How did you get from there to here? - A woman named Lois. (clears throat) The love of my life. We were partners at the same firm, until she "fell out" of love with me and fell into love with the senior partner. - That's harsh. - Well, let's just call it a "disincentive" to continue practicing. It's a nest of vipers. - Do you ever think-- - No. No. (indistinct chatter) - Are you gonna ask the candy lady out? - Not until I make partner. - Oh, come on! Then I think you should go to the speed dating thing. - I'm not doing it! - You're always complaining about how you don't have enough time to date. So this is perfect. Speed dating... Get it? For people who don't have a lot of time. - Ruby, I've had plenty of girlfriends. I honestly don't need your help. - How about online dating? I think you should take a whack at that. - Why do I have children and security guards giving me life advice? - 'Cause you need it. - Gee, thanks. Why do you care so much if I have a girlfriend? - I'm twelve. How interesting do you think my life is? (insects chirping) - Look. - Wow! (small laugh) - I keep telling you: I'm gifted. - You are going to kill! - Helen, this is incredible! I don't know how to thank you. - Oh, come on. Free baby-sitting is plenty. - He isn't baby-sitting. He enjoys my company. - Yes. - She's right! So I'll be over at 6 o'clock tomorrow. Ms. Kulick and I are gonna go trick or treating for a couple of hours and then I'm off to the ball! - As you command, my prince. (chuckling) - Good morning, Sam! - Happy Halloween, Rob! - Happy Halloween to you! - I'm thinking of going as a clown. - You like clowns? - No, I'm terrified of them. I thought this would be cheaper than therapy. (both laughing) Think this will get me a raise? - Alright, guys and girls! Attention! We're letting you all go fifteen minutes early so you can go and get ready for the Samford Halloween Ball! Really? Nothing? (soft cheering) Hey, yeah! I thought you were on that! - I was. I did. I registered it, Dad. I swear I did! - Well, you better get this straightened out right away! I don't care if it takes all night! - The ball is tonight! I delegated this job to Rob. This is not my fault. - Then get him to do it! Someone's got to handle it! - Yes, Dad. - So? - So it's Samford, with an "m". Which means that Sanford, the company we're fighting against, can still buy domain names Samford Candy needs. - This is your fault, right. You're gonna fix it. - Wait, how is this my fault? - I asked you to register it. You must have misspelled it. - No, that isn't true. You never asked me to register anything. - Are you calling me a liar? - No, you said you'd handle it. - You have to write a motion to set aside. It's gonna take all night. You might as well forget the party. - Listen, Emmett-- - If I see you at the ball, you're fired. - You're not serious? - Try me. - I'm sorry, Ruby. There's no way I can leave and take you trick or treating. - [You're going to the ball--] - I can't go to the ball either. - [What about the costume?] [It's gorgeous!] - I'm stuck in the office. Tell your mom I'll wear her costume next year, if I can. - [It's not gonna be the same] [without you.] - Have fun. - [Bye.] (typing on keyboard) - Sorry, sweetheart. No can do. - Just let me go up for a minute. - No trick or treating in the building. There's nobody here. - What about Rob Carelli? He's my uncle. - You're Ruby! His Ruby! Yeah, he talks about you all the time. Just go on up. - You don't even have a door on your office? - It's a step up from the cubicle I used to have. - Dreaming big, uncle Rob? - What are you doing here? - You gotta go to this ball, man. - I can't. I haven't even finished up Emmett's mess and if he sees at the ball, I'm fired. - Has he seen your costume? Then you're going to the ball! - I really can't, buddy. - You really can. - I have tons of work and they lock the building down at midnight. - So? No problem. You just gotta be back here by midnight. - Or what? I turn into a pumpkin? (animated chatter) (people laughing) Merry, it's Rob. - You're not supposed to be here. - I'm well aware of that. I'm just going to avoid Higgins senior and juniors. - Did you get the motion done? - Almost. I'm going to go back before midnight and finish up. - Don't forget to cross those i's and dot those t's. You go over there! Look, tonight, you're not an associate. You're a prince! Go act like one! - Good evening, my princess. - Strange coincidence! - Maybe it's not a coincidence. Maybe it's synchronicity. - I'm Elyse Samford. - Yeah, I know. - Okay, this is usually where you tell me what your name is. - Remember that old board game, Mystery Date? Tonight, I'm your mystery date. - I kinda like that. Okay, so what do you do when you're not princing? - I can't tell you that either. - Okay, so what can we talk about? - You, the night... Bowling. - Bowling? - It's one possibility. We don't have to. I know a lot of people find it lame. - No! I'm a big Kelly Kulick fan. I mean, you've got to love a woman who took a PBA title away from a man. I have a custom Storm. I have bowled one perfect game in my life, have a slight right hook, but I'm working on it. And I love bowling with my dad. - I'm a big Kelly Kulick fan, too. ♪♪♪ May I have this dance, my lady? - Oh! I can barely walk in these, let alone dance. I haven't waltzed in ages. - Don't worry. I'll lead. ♪♪♪ - I never knew that waltz could be so romantic. - Me neither. I learned from my sister and a 12-year-old. (laughing) Let's not forget these. - (Elyse): Beautiful moon. - Sure is. Your glass slippers, my lady. - Actually, they're Lucite. - Yeah? - Yes. - Little trick I learned from my grandfather, the shoemaker. (chuckling) - Thank you. This has turned out to be a magical night. - It has. - (Carter): May I have a Cuba Libre, please? - Give me a VRB. (clears throat) Two to one ratio energy drink to vodka. Don't mess it up. - Emmett, I'm gonna need you to go by the office and bring me the Sheehy brief so I can look at it tonight. - Are you okay? - But the building will be closed by the time I get there. It's almost midnight. - (Carter): You'd better hurry. - Let me get you a drink. - Yes. - Okay. (contented sigh) - Are you gonna read it here? - I'll read it tonight, at home. - Your gift bag, sir. - Ow! - So you want me to go to the office right now? - That's exactly what I want you to do. (insects chirping) - Taxi! Taxi! - Your gift bag, sir. - 54, Gaily Avenue. Go, go, go! - Have you seen a masked prince? - No, I'm sorry. - No? Okay, thank you. - Hey, fetch the car. Come on! Get this. Thanks. (frustrated groan) (indistinct chatter) - Sam, Emmett's right behind me! I need you to slow him down. - My pleasure. Nice suit! (panting) (elevator bell ringing) Yeah? Help ya? - Open it up. I need to get in the office. Open the door! - Oh, right! I didn't recognize you in your getup there. This should do it. (grunting) No, no. (small laugh) Drive you crazy, uh? I'm pretty sure that's it. Yeah, there you go. (nervous sigh) - Come on, get in! - (Sam): There you go. They should have a turnstile on that. You could get a can opener for that thing! I will let it slide this time. (panting) - Oh! You've been busy, Carelli? You're only missing out on the greatest party ever. Chin up. - I had the most incredible night. - Tell me about it. - I met someone. - Tell me about him. - That's the problem. I can't. - Well, what does he do? - Don't know. - What does he look like? - Couldn't tell ya. - How in the world can you not know what somebody looks like? - Oh, he was wearing a mask. - Oh right, yeah. The costume ball. But you seem to have felt a strong connection with this fella. And you weren't able to catch his name or a phone number? - Well, it didn't come up. He offered to get me a drink, the clock struck twelve, and then I never saw him again. - Hey, Uncle Rob. - [Ruby!] - So how was it? - The ball? Or her? - You know. - [She's amazing.] - What? - SHE'S AMAZING! She's amazing. Thank you, Ruby, for making me go. - No problem. - I can't imagine what going from being a lawyer to this is like. - No. You cannot. - But we're turning things back around. I signed you up for a continuing education class. All you need is 25 hours, unless you've been arrested. - Great. - You haven't been arrested, have you? - No. But who says I want to be a lawyer again? - You can say a lot of bad things about being an attorney, but it's got to beat working as a security guard for twelve bucks an hour. - Debatable. - Look, here's a list of the classes you need to go to. - Not gonna happen. - Sam-- - Thanks for the attempt, all right? - Sam? - What? - You can do this. (scoffing) - Maybe we could get some DNA off of this crown and put it in some sort of database. - Ooh, do-- Oh, you're kidding. - A little. Not that I'm not taking this seriously. I am. Very seriously. - Okay, look. I've crossed off the name of all the people I know and then all the people I can eliminate. Those are the ones that are left. - I think most of these people work for Carter Higgins. - Really? Are you sure? - Seems that way. I think we should call Higgins. - Okay. - [Higgins and Sons, good morning.] - Carter Higgins, please. It's Elyse Samford. - What did I do? - Did you talk to Elyse Samford at the Ball? - No. Why? Did she say I did? - Does she know what costume you were wearing? - No, nobody does. You saw me. I was totally incognito so I could spy on the staff. Good idea, huh? - I'm having a brainstorm. I'm going to need 150% from you on this. - You got it. - Elyse? Hi, Emmett Higgins here. I understand you're looking for me. A prince costume, yes. Yep, that was me. Where did I go? Well, there was an emergency back at the office, my dad needed me. You know how it is when your father needs you, you gotta go. I've been meaning to call you, I just... I didn't know if you felt the same way that I did. Well, so... when can we get together? Excellent. It's a date. See ya. - Hey, Dad, I think I found him. - See you tomorrow. - Uh, yeah. See ya. (soft music) - So... we have a lot in common, don't we? We both work for our fathers... - It's great being part of a family-owned business, huh? - Mm-hmm. It is. Oh man, it really is. But it must be great being handed over the reins. - It's a mixed blessing. I mean, I would have happily been willing to wait if my father hadn't been ready to retire. - Our dads were great in their day, but... fresh ideas can really infuse a business with new life, right? Survival of the fittest, know what I mean? Would you like to start with some wine? - Sure. - I spent my junior year in France studying with one of the top vintners in the world. I will handle this. - You seem so different than the other night. - Well, like wine, I improve with time. Ahem! We'll have a bottle of the Lafite Rothschild 2000. - Oh no, no, I... That's over a thousand dollars a bottle! - I know. And you... you're worth every penny. I feel a real... connection, don't you? - Did I seem tipsy to you at the Ball? - No. - No? You sure you were wearing a prince's costume? - 150%. - Okay... Sorry, I just... hand cramp. Hey, Dad. - You're home early. - Yeah, kind of a letdown, actually. He wasn't really what I expected. - Expectations, huh? Is this fellow worth a second chance? - I don't know. He was kind of a jerk. - In that case, you made the right choice in cutting him loose. Be patient. As they say, if it's meant to be, I'm sure you two will connect. - Night, Dad. - Had her eating out of the palm of my hand. - Perfect. Then help me convince her to sell to Sanford. - Sanford wants to take over Samford? Wait, did I say that right? - Sounds fantastic, doesn't it? - Well, it doesn't sound fantastic for Samford. - Maybe not, but it does for the Higgins. If we can talk her into this, well, you know, I'll have positioned myself so we can make a fortune. This goes through, I buy a little island somewhere and you boys take over the business. You like that? - Yeah. - Ah! Elyse, how are you? Nice to see you. - Good to see you. - Did you get a beverage? Can I get you something? - Oh no, I'm fine. - Well, have a seat. - So what's going on? You said it was important. - Yeah. An absolutely amazing business proposal has come in. - Fantastic. Let's hear it. - I have to tell you it's a tremendous piece of news. Are you ready? - I'm as ready as I'm gonna be. - We have an offer on the table to buy Samford Candy. - Sell Samford? I'm not interested in selling Samford. - Just hear me out. - It's been in my family for generations. - There are major advantages to considering this offer. How much time you'll have for more travel, your charitable activities... You could remain on the board of Samford and continue to have a say in the matters that are important to you. - What's important to me is growing my family's business. - Elyse, don't dismiss this out of hand. This is an extremely generous offer. - Really? Who's making it? - Sanford. We're talking the kind of money that would allow you to devote the rest of your life to making a real difference. Promise me you'll think about it. I'll send you the offer. Remember, you and Sanford are the major players in this industry. Together, you'll be a behemoth. Unstoppable. - Well, I will consult with my father about it. - Thank you. As your advisor and friend of the family, I highly recommend this deal. The economy is shaky, the future uncertain. Samford may never be worth this much money again. - Thank you. I'll see myself out. - Have a good day. Send Andrew in. - Hey. - Possible buyout of Samford. Go through it. - Samford is incredibly successful. Why in the world would they wanna sell? - You're not being paid to ask questions. Just look it over, okay? - The question is, why is Higgins pushing this? Samford gets bought out, he loses his biggest client. How is that to his advantage? - Unless he's representing Sanford, too. - He can't be. That's a blatant conflict of interest. - Too obvious. - Well, the whole thing sounds shady. - So what are you going to do about it? - I'm going to try to find out what's really going on. - Anything we can do? - Maybe. Let me get back to you. Just, uh... forgot something. "Dottsandcrossis". Hmm... "EmmettandAndrew". "150%". I can't believe I'm doing this. Gotta find something to help Elyse. Come on, show me something. Samford with an "m". Nothing. (vacuuming sound) Caught you. - I just wanted to see how much I remembered. - Come on, Sam, admit it, this is helping you. It'll be the only good thing happening in my life. - Why? What's wrong? - My boss is trying to talk Elyse Samford into selling her company and I know something dirty's going on. I thought maybe he had a big position in Samford stock and was going to cash in, but he doesn't. - Higgins isn't stupid enough to hold a huge position in his own name, it's too obvious. Plus he's her counsel; it's a conflict of interest. - Yeah, I know. - Unless he's buying Samford stock under somebody else's name. Ever hear of a stealth takeover? You might wanna check the stockholders. - How-- - Used to specialize in mergers and acquisitions. - Of course. Thanks. Okay, so we need to identify the names of the major stockholders of Samford candy. - 30% of Samford stock is institutionally owned, pension funds, things like that. It's hard to find individual names. I got Joseph Burns, Alexandra Teller, Haro Sinanian, RiGlo Holdings.... - Fantastic. Are there any more dumplings? - Now what do we do? - Search Higgins with each of these names. - That's my girl! Anything? - Nothing. We can't connect Higgins with any of the shareholders. - There's a Glogau. - What's a Glogau? - Somebody's name. It's a picture of Higgins' graduating class. Yep, Rick Glogau. See, just like the others, his name doesn't show up as a shareholder. - What's the name of that company again? - RiGlo Holdings? - RiGlo Holdings! Rick Glogau! I found him! - So maybe Higgins had his old college buddy buy a large position for him and is pushing Elyse into selling Samford so the stock goes up and he makes a killing. - RiGlo Holdings has been buying Samford stock for the last couple of months. - Great day! - Not again. - Sam, we found somebody who's been buying big positions in Samford stock. - Can you prove Higgins is behind it? - You know, you should really consider a law career. I need to get more information, but there isn't a lot of time. - Pair of shoes. - What are you doing? - That's her. - Who? - The candy lady. - Thank you so much. - Yeah, she's the lady we were talking to by the candy machine at Plaza Bowl. - She's the one from the ball. - Ohh! - Wait. Wait! - Hi. I'm Ruby. - Yeah, I remember you. Hi, "Rob not Ray". - Hi. - Do you want to bowl with us? - You don't have to. We don't want to intrude. - That would be great. I just came here to take my mind off some things. - I know what you mean. - You want to play for cash? A little friendly bet? (chuckling) - Don't listen to her. We usually just play for pizza. - Ooh. Anchovy and pineapple? - Ew. - I'm just kidding! Don't choke now. - I'm waaaay beyond reverse psychology. See? - Ohh! Okay. - Hey, you dropped your wallet! - Ha, ha, ha! Boom! Did you think I was gonna fall for that tired old line? Go, Ruby! - She bowls to the right, she bowls to the left, watch out now 'cause Ruby's the best! - (both chanting): Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! - Maybe I should find a new sport. - Are you kidding? You are absolutely the best twelve-year-old bowler I know! - Rob is the best uncle in the world. He spends tons of time with me. Not many single guys out there like that, right? - Yeah, you guys are lucky to have each other. - Yeah, it's great he has me, but what he really needs is a girlfriend. (chuckling) - Don't mind her, she just thinks I can't function on my own. - Well, you guys, I've had a great time, but I am gonna have to hit the road. - What about the pizza? - I'm gonna have to take a rain check. Rob, you know where to find me. - Hey... Is that a custom Storm? - Yeah. How did you know that? - A friend of mine had one once. - Yeah, but it's not marked. - Yeah, well... Don't wanna keep ya! - Okay. See you guys. - I can't believe you didn't tell her you were the prince. - Thanks for keeping my secret. - Why didn't you tell her that your boss is trying to cheat her? - I wanted to. - Then why didn't you? - I can't really prove it. Plus I could tell her and she could not believe me. Or I could tell her and start a huge fire storm and it could turn out she wasn't going to take the deal, anyway. And then I'd get fired for nothing. - Don't you always tell me to do the right thing no matter what? - It isn't that simple. You ready for pizza? - Not hungry. - Come on, you're always hungry. - Well, I'm not hungry. - Come on, Ruby. Morning. - If you want to know how the class is going, it's filled with arrogant young shysters. - So you're still going? - For lack of anything better to do. - By the way, I paid all your dues, so all you have to do is finish the classes and you can practicing law again. - You're a good guy, you know that? - Not exactly. - Rob, I'm telling you you're a good guy. Me. Sam. The guy who hates everybody? Hey, Rob. - Yeah? - (under his breath): Thanks. - Did you actually just say "thanks?" - I may have. No, no, no, I don't do the hug. Hey, hey! Ah! Okay, we're good. We're good. - Thanks. Thank you. - Did you go through the offer? - Why are we pushing her to sell a hugely successful company? I mean, if they sell, we could lose-- - Did you go through it or not? - I did. But Elyse Samford just took over as CEO. If they wanted to sell, shouldn't they have done it before her father stepped down? - Tick, tick, tick. That's the sound of you wasting my time. - I'm just thinking that-- - You're not being paid to think. - I'm not being paid to ask questions, I'm not being paid to think. Then what am I being paid for? - To cross the t's and dot the i's. - Do you even read, or did you think you'd get a promotion if it looks like you can? - I passed the bar my first try. Unlike yourself, who still hold the state record for number of times failed. But I guess when Daddy's the boss, it doesn't matter, does it? - The cloud ate my calendar. - I'll take a look at it later. Do you have Elyse Samford's number? - If it didn't eat my contacts, I do. - [Hello?] - Elyse? It's Rob Carelli. I've got to come talk to you. - [Okay.] - Right away. I struggled over whether to come to you with this, but I had to tell you about my suspicions. - If you're concerned there's something going on, I'd like to hear about it. Have a seat. - It looks to me like Higgins is buying stock in your company in someone else's name, betting on the takeover going through. - What makes you think that's the case? - Why else would he be pushing this? - Do you have anything to prove that allegation? - One of the major stockholders is an old college friend of Carter's. He's buying the shares through a holding company. - Can you prove the connection to Higgins? - No. - Carter Higgins has been Samford's legal counsel for decades. And I barely know you. So tell me why I should believe you. - No reason in the world other than the fact that I have nothing to gain by coming to you with this and everything to lose. But Higgins, if I'm right, stands to make a fortune if you go through with this. - But I don't know if you're right. You don't even know if you're right. - I know this is a big leap, but if you could just look into it further. - You realize if I confront Carter about this, I'm going to have to cite you as my source. Otherwise nothing I say will seem credible. - I understand that. - You'll probably lose your job. - No probably about it. - Then why are you doing this? Why do you care if my family business gets bought out? - I... The night of the... - Yes? - I just can't stand around watching you get swindled. - Well, thank you for coming to me. I appreciate you risking your job. I'm going to have to think it over. (whimsical music) - I'm glad you told her about the takeover. - Thanks. - I'm proud of you. Is she going to stop it? - I don't know. I'm not sure if she believed me. - Is there anything else you can do? - I'm out of options. My hands are tied. - What if you told her you're the prince? - It's complicated. Things don't always go the way we want them to. Life isn't a fairy tale. Everyone doesn't always live happily ever after. - Ruby! Hey, what are you doing here? Are you alone? - We need to talk. - Okay, come on. - Ms. Samford. - Hey, Peter. Go ahead. Thank you, Peter. We won't be long. - Furthermore, the plaintiff in the case-- What's going on? - Carelli was absolutely not at the Ball. He was here working all night. Emmett saw him. - My mom made the costume just for him. Rob was the prince at the Ball. Rob is the one who fell in love with this lady. - He did? - He really did. - Well, that's ridiculous. The kid's obviously lying. My son Emmett wore that prince's costume. - You're the one lying. - Let's just get Rob and Emmett in here. Now. - [Emmett? Get Andrew and come into my office.] (knocking) - Andrew, Dad's office. Now. - [Carelli, get into my office.] - I swear, Dad, I came back from the Ball and I saw him here. You were working all night, right? - I snuck out and went to the Ball. When I overheard your father telling you to come back here, I took off and just beat you back. - That's impossible! You'll have to take his word or ours, Elyse. There's simply no proof. No proof! - Little trick my grandfather taught me. - Ew. - Your favorite bowler is Kelly Kulick. You've bowled one perfect game and you have the softest lips in the world. - Hey! You're fired! - I don't think you're in the right pay grade to do that, little brother. - Dad, fire him! - You can assume that if he was lying to you about who the prince at the Ball was, then he's also lying about his involvement in the Sanford buyout. - That's it! Carelli, get your things! - Why did I have to find out from Rob that Sanford was cybersquatting our domain name? It seems to me if you were looking out for my best interests, you would have been aware of that a long time ago. Unless of course you didn't want me to know about it because you knew Sanford was planning to try and buy us. - I'm absolutely appalled at those accusations, young lady. - Carter, I am firing your firm as counsel to Samford Candy Co. I will have my new lawyer, Mr. Carelli, send over a termination letter and collect all files today. - Oh, and Mr. Higgins, you can expect a call from the SEC about this. - Score! - You do not get to talk to my father like that! You'll be sorry! - Emmett? - Yeah? - Shut up. - Yes, Dad. - Hi, Rob. - Hey, Sally. (knocking) Sam, you are looking good. - Stop. - How's the new apartment? - It's more like a closet but I'll do for starters. - Alright, "and associates." Ready to go? - Absolutely. Shall we? - We shall. - By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. (applause) - Ha! We got married.
