Attack on Mumbai! NSG on standby and waiting for permission from Home Ministry. They are coming towards the hotel. Handle them. News is coming in that the NSG, National Security Guard, which is India's most elite force, is taking over the operation from MARCOS, that is, Marine Commandos and... Sir, they are firing at the hostages. Major Sandeep! You're the only one in the heritage wing. Ali! Watch the door. Major Sandeep, it's not advisable for you to go in alone! We don't know how they'll ambush us. Major Sandeep, come in! Major Sandeep, do you copy me? Major Sandeep, are you there? Major Sandeep, do you copy? Major, how many are there? Don't come up. I'll handle them. Sandeep's life is not just about the 26/11 attacks. He has a life of his own. - Mom! - Sandeep? Are you all right? Hi, baby! How are you? - Let me go! - Mom! Roger! You are the only one concerned about me. Are you concerned about anyone else? I don't understand why you do such things. Let it go. - Let's go, Dad! - Let go of me. Are you so patriotic that you forget us? Will you forget your family for your duty? All this... What was the need to cross the border without permission? Firing at the outpost! Firing at the outpost! Captain Sandeep! Come in! Captain Sandeep! Respond! Over! Go back! We are warning you! This is the Pakistan border! Indian army! Go back to your side! Sir, Sandeep is in no-man's-land! Are these Pakistanis drinking during the day? This is our final warning to the Indian army! - Come back! - Come back! Captain Sandeep! Come back! Why did you cross the border and enter Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, Sandeep? You cannot go into POK! - This is our side, and that... - That is ours too, sir. What? That is also ours. Sandeep's life is etched in our hearts. Sometimes his childhood comes up, and other times, how mischievous he was. Memories have no fixed order. He was always like that. Always listened to others, but did what felt right to him. We used to worry a lot. Being Sandeep's family meant to be worried all the time. - Did you find the thief? - I'm not the cop, you are. Sandhya doesn't like it here in the village. If she is with you in Bangalore, she'll study well like Sandeep, and get better grades too. Why are you in jail? I stole a gold chain from a woman. Did you do it because you were hungry? Come home quietly tonight. I'll tell mom, she'll feed you. - Hey! - Sandeep! Move away! Get back to your work. I told you to sit on the bench. Don't you understand? - Mom, he is... - Quiet! Come! Let's go! Sandeep! Come on, get up. I'm not hungry. I have kheer for you! Tell me something. Whenever we come to your uncle's house, why do you like to play in the jail? I love his uniform. But they are not good people. They are very bad. Burglars, thugs... people like that! No, Mom. I saw it in his eyes. He was not a bad man. He was just sad. Sorry, my dear. I yelled at you. Do you know how scared I was? Why, Mom? I'm here for you! Don't be scared. Sandeep! The movie is about to start, come fast! - Coming, Mom! - Dear! Fast! Come fast! Arnold Swaz... - Swazi... - Schwarzenegger. Yes, Arnold "Shivajinagar"! - Come fast! - Dhanu. Why do you keep watching the same film over and over again? Open your eyes! Hey! - Dad. - What? - I need to pee! - Give me a minute! Let me finish this. Sandhya... - Will you come with me outside? - No, I'm scared. I'll buy you an ice cream. It's mom's. Hurry up, please! I'm not done yet. Coming! Sandhya? Aunt! There's a dog here. Dear, couldn't you have waited a bit longer? I couldn't wait, Dad. Weren't you afraid to go alone? Oh, because Sandhya was with you? But she is younger than you. What if she wasn't there? You're there for me. And what if I wasn't? I know you'll always be there, Dad. You are my commando! Arnold style! Dad, come! If we miss the train, we'll miss Navy Day! Let's go, come on. Back then, we didn't realize. But Sandeep saw his purpose in the eyes of a soldier. Maybe only a soldier truly understands a soldier. So, Sandeep wanted to be a soldier since he was a child? How did you feel about that... We wanted our Sandeep to be well educated and secure a job. We just wanted Sandeep to be happy. Okay. "What is the motto of the Indian Navy?" Sam no varunah is the motto of the Indian Navy. Yes, sir. I am confident. Hey, Sandy. Tell me how to impress Paddu. - Paddu? - Padma. - Oh, okay. - Just be yourself, dude. But she doesn't like myself. - What are you doing? - Just preparing. Haathi! To flirt with a girl, you either need style or brains. A girl from Delhi just joined school. She's hot. - Who is this? - The girl from Delhi. - Bye, Haathi! Bye, Sandeep! - Hey, Bandar, wait for me! This is the boys' bathroom. Girls' washroom was out of order. There was no one when I came. Then you guys came in. And my class is about to start. Nice bag. Hi. Sandeep. The girl from Delhi. - Don't you have a name? - It's not for you. It's personal. Okay? Excuse me. Isha? - Hey! - Your name is on the bag. Anyway, you're not going to complain about my friends, are you? What if I do? I'll complain too, that you were in the boys' bathroom. Waste fellow! - What's this? - Sandhya... You're joining the Navy? Does dad know? - Quiet! - Dad wants you to study medicine. And mom says engineering. Then why this different path? I don't know, I just want to. You've watched too many of those commando films! You're not Arnold. What's going on? Mom, at Ms. Renuka's house... - I'll go and check. - No! It's not our problem. - Mom... - Just get back to your studies. Exams are about to begin. Always up in arms to save people! Happy birthday, Isha! Thanks! Hi, Dad... Dad didn't come? Dear, he was going to, but he had to rush to Delhi. How could he forget? - Mom? - She'll meet you at dinner. She's at a party now. By the way, your dad asked me to give you this. Hi! You dropped your money? I threw it. So, it's mine then. Okay, let's go spend it. Get lost. If the principal gets to know of this... - Are you threatening me? - No. I'm blackmailing you! For Sandhya... This? Or that? You don't have much fashion sense, do you? The western one. But I like this one. But that is better! - Excuse me. - Yes, sir. Can we get the western one? Why don't you try it once, for Sandhya? No! I don't have time to try on dresses for your girlfriend! Try it, ma'am. Waste fellow! Not bad! Okay. Average. By the way, Sandhya is my sister. My girlfriend is Smita. Silk Smita! Isha, you like this dress. It's your birthday. Happy Birthday, Isha. Jangayya. - Please drop Sandeep. - Why? Will your parents be upset if they see you with your boyfriend? - Boyfriend? - Yeah. Come on, I don't have the keys. That's the library, and that's the balcony. - Where is your room? - Huh? Cool! A pager! Gift from my mom. It's your birthday, where are your parents? Dad avoids mom and is always busy with his business trips. And mom avoids loneliness with her parties. They're never home. Isha. I'm not here because you are alone. I'm here so that you're not alone. You need to call the telephone company to give them the message and pager number. - Then they send the message. - Then give me your number! Hey, Isha. - Give me your pager number. - Write it down. Four. - Four? - Four? That's it for now. What? Why? That's as much as I like you. Two. Badge number 15. In the last four days, you've cleared your exams with flying colors. Do you feel you are good enough for our training? Sir, the training is physical and mental, but the feeling is personal. Nice! The movie was... Shah Rukh was too good in the movie. I want that guitar. Sandhya! - Oh! Sandhya, hi! - Hi, Isha. Swiss Institute of Architecture. My dream college. Superb! Five. My trophies, my medals, and... my photos. Sandhya! You're back? - Stay here! - Sandhya! Sandhya? - Dad? - Sandhya... I don't know. - I'm sorry... - No, I'm sorry. This is a good one of Padma. Zero. Eight. Zero. Six. Four. Zero. Two. Eight. Three. Five. My pager number. I'm no less than your father! My name is Shahenshah! Welcome to the farewell costume party, guys! Let's see who wins the best costume! Where's Sandeep? He is over there, in the Navy costume. Hi! Wow. Average, decent, not bad. - What? - Well, you have decent taste. Remember, the other day in the shop... Is this why you want to be a soldier? - Why? - So that all the girls fall for you! Not all, just one. Sandeep! Don't worry. I'll save you. Sandeep. My pager number. Sandeep. I have to tell you something. I... Jangayya, stop the car! Let me go. They are watching. Sandeep... Ma'am... Ms. Renuka... Is that acid? Yes, I think so. Hey! What's happening here? - Come to the police station! - My wife, my wish. - I'll do as I please. - Come on! I thought it was acid. You knew about this? This isn't something you hide. Come in, sir! We were waiting for you. What's this letter from Special Services? With whose permission did you apply in the Navy? Tell me! I'm glad you got rejected. He couldn't clear the medical test. You have an eyesight problem. You failed the test. We thought you'd be a doctor. But you were planning to get into the Navy? I've told people you're going to be a doctor. What should I tell them now? That my son is going into the Navy? Hey. You're bleeding! What happened? Sandeep, tell me what happened! Ms. Renuka... - I've told you not to interfere... - But ma'am, if it wasn't for him, Ms. Renuka... I'm Isha, Sandeep's classmate. Please come in. Sandhya. Mom, is the coffee ready? Sandeep. I'm sorry, I didn't say anything in the car. - I was scared. - Why? Don't you understand? You didn't realize what you were doing. What if it was really acid? Without a second thought, you ran to save her. And now, you want to get trained to save more people. I knew about this. But now I understand. So, I think we should be... Just friends. You're sitting next to me and pushing me away. Listen, my parents are enough to make me feel lonely. I keep waiting for them. - And now you'll be gone too. - Where? The Navy rejected me, didn't you hear? Will that stop you, Sandeep? Anyway, Navy is not the only place for soldiers. So... Navy is not the only place for soldiers. Whenever we come to your uncle's house, why do you like to play in the jail? I love his uniform. You're joining the Navy? Why this different path? I don't know. I just wanted to. Sandhya? Without a second thought, you ran to save her. I'm joining the Army, Dad. When a father gets angry and scolds, his son usually looks down quietly. And that day, Sandeep was quiet, but never looked down. Dear... This NDA, Army... I'm scared. What if something happens to you? What if every mother thinks this way? Call once you reach. - What happened? - He forgot his admission letter. - Dad! - Stop! Dad? Admission letter. I have it, Dad. That's a photocopy. Take care of yourself. I'll go, Mom. Bye, Dad. Bye, Sandhya. Whatever he wanted to do, whatever he wanted to become were all his own decisions. We realized that Sandeep was never really ours. He belonged to the country. - Gentlemen! - Sir! Welcome to the National Defense Academy. Here you will learn how to serve your nation. Your duty is to act without an eye on the fruit that it will bring. - And you will train for it. - Start! To face every challenge. In every breath. In every moment. In your soul. Only the first two will get water. Thirsty? Go back to base camp. Right, left, grab. This means to halt, alert, aim. - Mom. - How are you, dear? I can't believe I'm really at the NDA. Hi. Your duty is not just to fight or die. Your duty is to protect. By land, by sea, by air, by God! Cadets, faster! Move! Move! Come on, move! Isha, after what you said the other day, about being just friends, I can't get over it. This is my fifth letter in the last six months. You haven't responded to any. I'm not sure if you are busy, or upset. Who will we be after this training? We become, what? Men, who fight for the nation. So are you saying Lakshmibai, the Queen of Jhansi, never fought for the country? Sir, those who save people. Doctors do that too, Veer. Who do we become? Soldiers, sir. So, Mr. Unnikrishnan, what does it mean to be a soldier? What makes one a soldier? What does it mean to be a soldier? Isha. I was asked a question during training today. "What does it mean to be a soldier?" What makes one a soldier? I didn't have an answer. I stopped. Do I really know? Will I ever know? How much do I work for it? How hard do I try? How much do I fight within? First time coming first, Unnikrishnan. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Good job, Harsh. Water. Okay, boys! Line up. Good job! But you know the drill. You will get water only at the base camp. What does it mean to be a soldier? One cannot answer this question, one can only live it. And I promise you, I will spend every minute of my life becoming the answer to your question, sir. Veer. Come here. It was just for fun, dude. Earlier this morning, in south-east Imphal, there was a landmine explosion. Nine soldiers of the tenth battalion of the Jammu Kashmir Light Infantry became martyrs. One of them was severely injured. This army convoy was headed towards the army base from Thoubal district. After the landmine explosion, the terrorists fired at the army convoy, in which eight soldiers became martyrs. Veer? Dude, I don't feel good about what is happening. What? The letters Isha and you wrote to each other... Harsh... Your letters never reached Isha. Isha has sent you five letters so far. Harsh hid them all. - Harsh! - Sandeep? Where are the letters? Where are the letters! Why? Sorry. Sandeep, how are you? How is NDA? The time I spent with you in school will always be special for me. I got your address from Bandar, and I'm writing to you. I hope you page me, or you can call me on this number. I'm waiting. Sandeep. She's leaving, for Switzerland. The number you are trying... The pager number you are trying is not available. Sandeep, did you get my letter? Why are you not responding to me? Since you've gone to the NDA, you don't have the time to talk to me. Do you really not have the time, or do you not want to talk? I got a letter from Zurich today, Sandeep. 25th July. I'm leaving. Jangayya. Isha? Okay, Dad, I'm going. Sandy? What are you doing here? I read your letters only last night. I paged you. Tried calling too. Dad got it disconnected. I'm going to Zurich. You read my letters last night? - Isha. - Dad... Who's that? - Isha, stop! - Come with me, I'll explain. What's going on? Isha! Are we running away? My bus to Pune leaves in five minutes. If I miss it, I'll miss the morning drill. So, I thought I'll spend these five minutes with you. You're right, Isha. I have very little time. But whatever I have, it's yours. Let me walk you there. Don't worry. I'll save you. Isha, dear. It's time for your flight. Isn't your flight tomorrow? Today is the 24th. If I had left for Zurich, I wonder when I would see you again. Pune! Pune! Pune! Isha! I love you. I wanted your reaction when I said it. Don't marry any white guy in Switzerland. And what if I do? I'll get rid of him and marry you. I love you too. They truly fell in love that day. But Sandeep had to leave. To be happy when he was around, and to wait for him when he was gone. This was our life. In the process of him being on duty and coming back in a few months, we didn't realize that he would be gone one day to never return. Don't eat lying down, you'll choke. Are you going to teach me how to... - This is all because of you. - Because of me? - See? - Yeah, Dad. See! Hey! Why don't you talk to Isha? How long do I have to cook for you? Mom! She can't cook like you. Look at you! Hey, stop it. Don't change the topic. She's working in Bangalore, and your duty is in Haryana. How will this work? Dad, not everyone is joined at the hip like both of you. Come on, let's go. Take care of yourself. Let's go. Hey, Commando! What's with the attitude? Come here. Love you, Dad. Sandeep! Listen. Call as soon as you reach Manesar. Mom. I stole something from you. Huh? Mom! I stole something from you. Guess what it is. I'll call you. Bye, Dad. I'm going. Tiger for Alpha. Over. Moving forward. Look out for landmines. Over. Alpha, come in! Patch over! Send Bravo to mark the perimeter. Wilco, over! Tear gas! - Door! Door! To the door! To the door! - Abort mission! Stop! - Actually... - Captain Aakash. You didn't detect the wire, and you tripped it. That's your first mistake. And your second mistake, your team panicked because of the tear gas and left the hostages behind. The third mistake, you didn't have plan B. Plan B is panicking and running away, sir. You think soldiers don't get scared? Imagine you're in a real war situation. You are surrounded by enemies, your entire team is dead, and you run out of bullets. That fear is what makes us human. Overcoming that fear is what makes us soldiers. And we are not just soldiers. We are the 51 Special Action Group of the NSG. Our duty is to protect others, and protect ourselves too. In a real war situation, the bullets are also real. Captain Aakash. Don't underestimate the enemy. What's the port for our entry? - Colaba Port. - We need one more for the second team. Sir! Headley has reached Mumbai. Balloons! Balloons! Sir, do you want some balloons? - How much? - 10 rupees. - Can you click a picture for me? - Yeah, okay. Here. These are fine. Taj photos? Here they are. Next to it is the tower. Headley has sent all the pictures. No man is alone in the NSG. We are all brothers. And you never leave a brother behind, remember! - Commandos! Huah! - Huah! And here comes our training officer Sandeep. Ever since you've become a Black Cat, you're always on time for work but never to a party. And it's not done, Officer. I have to be on time for duty, sir. But parties call for... IST. Sir, does IST stand for Indian Standard Time - or Indian Stretchable Time? - Ask him. Option B. Stretchable. Sir, you may be late to the party, but I'm very sure that you'll always be on time for battle. Not without you, Rajendar Singh. Thank you, sir. What happened? Sandeep gave you an earful again? Stop it! He was your buddy, and now you call him "sir". But he is my senior here. He was drafted into NSG first. He is a training officer now. You don't understand all this. That's why you get an earful. He lectured me about plan B. All of that doesn't matter in war. When you are being shot at, it's every man for himself. Sir, this... - Is it from home? - It's from ma'am. Okay, sir. Right, sir. Jai Hind. At ease, Major. - I need leave, sir. - Don't mind me asking, all okay? What's this? If I don't go now, I'll lose her forever, sir. Sandeep, I know this is important. Anyway, today is the 25th. - When do you want to leave? - Tomorrow. Kasab, careful. Hello, madam. I am Atul Kale, the husband. My wife, and Kale's children. Your IDs, please. Madam, I was born in Mumbai, in Dahisar. I need some ID, like your passport or identity card. - Ration card? - What? Colaba. Sir, shall I repeat your order? Yeah. As Lucy says. Sure, sir. You have been nice today, Lucy. Leopold. But I had a reservation for 26th November. - I'm sorry, ma'am. - This is the hard copy. Sometimes online bookings don't go through. - What's the problem? - Booking issue. Let me have a look, ma'am. What's the name? Pramoda Reddy. Pramoda Reddy? - Online booking, right, ma'am? - Yeah. - Your name is not on the list, ma'am. - Yes. But I will get a room for you. Yeah. Hello. Yeah, I can hear you. I've checked in. Listen, I need the term sheet before the dinner meeting. It's in three hours. Make sure it's ready. Hello. My name is Shirley. I am sorry. She is so friendly. - Do you need a hand, sir? - No need. Can I get some tea? Please wait for five minutes. We'll be back. Sure. Nazeer! Hafeez, they are running towards the hotel. Alert! It's chaos, sir, people are barging in! - The terrorists are firing outside! - Okay, you just go that side! Attack in Mumbai! I repeat, attack in Mumbai! NSG on standby! Waiting for permission from Home Ministry. - Kishore, cancel my ticket to Bangalore. - Sir. Hello, cancel sir's ticket. - Hello. - Dad, turn on the TV. Kishore, bring the nominal files, I need the names. - Right away, sir. - Are you going? No, Dad. They don't send training officers on missions. - But I have to get the boys ready. - Is that Sandeep? - Is the file ready? - Give it to me. - Listen, Prasad wants to see you. - Yeah, Mom. He'll be in Gurgaon today. He'll call you. Will you meet him? Sandeep? Are you listening? Hello? He hung up on me! I'll give him a piece of my mind when he calls back. Miss you, Mom. Come to mom soon. Just 31 hours. I'll see you the day after. - Okay? - Yeah, Mom. Okay. - Varun, flight's on time, right? - Yeah. - On time. Just boarded now. - Okay. I'm getting a call from the office, fly safe. - Yeah. Okay, bye. - Bye, baby. - Hey, Pramoda. - What's New York saying? - Working on it. - Okay. We've downloaded the reports. Got a few issues. Is the contract ready? - Yeah. Once we have... Hello? - Yes. Once we have information from the legal team, we can go ahead. Inform... One second. I can't hear. Wait a second. They're already celebrating as if we've won the match. The legal team is informed, right? - I'm going for dinner now. - Excuse me. - I don't have the time to repeat stuff... - Excuse me. Can you hear that? No, if I've told you something, please get it done. Otherwise, it's going to be a working Christmas for all of us. I'll call back. Excuse me... The CCTV? The server room is on the second floor. Burn it down. Listen... The number you're calling has been switched off. Gentlemen, terrorists have attacked Mumbai. Now we are awaiting a call from the Home Ministry for authorization. This might be one of the deadliest attacks India has ever seen. The commandos assigned for this mission have already been notified. I haven't been notified, sir! You will stay here at Manesar, Major Sandeep. Now commandos, buckle up! We'll have to start any moment. - Permission to speak in private, sir. - We will lead... You bloody well know the rules. Training officers are not sent on missions. You are my best training officer, I cannot afford to lose you. - Sir... - The decision is final, Sandeep. Sir, do you believe the NSG is India's best defense against a terrorist attack? Sandeep, what I'm trying to say is... Do you think 51 SAG is designed for handling a situation like that? - You... - Sir, do you believe my boys are the best in the country to deal with such a situation? I train them, sir. I'm their training officer. Now tell me, where should I be? Fall in, boys! Fall in! - Hello? - Kishore, is Sandeep around? He's gone out, sir. We are on high alert and I have to go. Jai Hind, sir. What... Breaking news! The terrorist firing at the CST station is now captured by the police. Sub Inspector Tukaram Omble played a crucial role in this capture at the Chowpatty check post. Sadly, Tukaram Omble was killed in action. He put his life on the line to catch the Pakistani terrorist, Ajmal Kasab. Get ready, guys! 51 SAG! Move! News is coming in that the NSG, National Security Guard, which is India's most elite force, is taking over the operation from MARCOS, that is, Marine Commandos and the SIT. - Gentlemen! - Sir! We are going to fight in a place that gives Mumbai its identity. The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. Our focus will be the Taj. The Mumbai police are waiting for us. The police are struggling to control the situation. The SIT and MARCOS have been fighting since last night. Boys, as of this moment, we do not know how many people are safe and how many people need to be saved. This is considered the deadliest attack in Indian history. It's chaos! Get ready! - Commandos! - Commandos! According to our sources, the NSG, National Security Guard, India's most elite force... Hafeez? The NSG is on its way. It's in the news. They have been briefed about the hostage situation... Let them come. The cameras are on. We'll show the world! And... One minute! The NSG buses! Boys, assemble! - Hello. - Kishore, where is Sandeep? They are showing that the NSG is in Mumbai... - Sir is out. - When will he be back? Sir is out. That's it. Hello, Kishore... This is not an open battlefield. 51 SAG! Shields up! Advance! Halt! Eyes up! Fire! Spearhead! - The NSG is here! - Move in! Halt! Secure the entrance! - Command center to the right! - Yes, Major. Identification? - Cordon the lobby. Quick! - Sir? How were they able to attack us from outside? They've been moving differently all day, sir. They have split into teams and spread in various directions. - One second. - Yeah. We are back to square one, sir. MARCOS has been fighting since last night. The areas they capture, the terrorists capture them back. - Aren't they able to hold them? - They don't have the force for it, sir. You guys move! Move! Move, guys! Suhaan, nobody goes in or out of the lobby without authorization. - The entire lobby needs to be secured. - On it, sir. Sandeep, you need to hear this. What part of the hotel is in our control? Just the lobby, sir. But they are all over the place. Sir, till there. Beyond that point, they could be anywhere, sir. Come on out! Now! Please, no! Oh, please! Please! Please don't kill me! - Shut up! - Please, don't kill me! - You've got to believe me. - Where is your passport? - I'm not American. I'm British. - Where is your passport? Where is it! Iftekhar. There's no one in that room. Look at the list. -We need to get a layout -Sir. What is this? Where is the blueprint? Sir, the architect is on vacation. He isn't answering our calls. We've tried everything. So we don't have an actual blueprint. NSG will enter from here, and we are here. We are here in the lobby, sir. This is the corridor adjacent to the lobby. A left from here takes you to the grand staircase, sir. Another left from there goes to the sea lounge. Above that, we have the south block. Going right from the grand staircase leads you to the north block. North block, three of you. There are 75 rooms on each floor. They could be hidden anywhere. It's a bloody maze. - CCTV? - They burnt down the CCTV server room on the second floor. - What about radio communication? - No radio, sir. They can tune into our frequency. - Tear gas? - No tear gas. The guests won't be able to handle tear gas, and they'll become easy targets. You guys wear police uniforms. If we counter attack, they'll use civilians for protection. We can't differentiate civilians from terrorists, and we don't know how many terrorists are there. NSG can only enter from the front. They don't even have air support. Boys, we are totally blind. Standard protocols won't work. We need a new strategy. Then what? Kill everyone. Locations, weapons, targets, they've planned everything. We don't have any information. And we don't have the time, sir. But we are here. I have a plan, sir. Snipers. We need snipers all around the Taj. We'll have snipers on the entire outside perimeter, sir, so they can cover us from all directions. SWS 1 on the Gateway. SWS 2 near the Wasabi. Eagle 2 in position. Eagle 1 in position, sir! If the terrorists show themselves, we'll eliminate them, sir. Eagle 1, we are inside sea lounge. Can you see us? Negative, sir. The sea lounge has tinted windows. No view, sir. Eagle 2, clear view of Wasabi restaurant But no movement. Over. Copy. Let's take the stairs. - Room number? - 105, sir. Open the door. You're safe now. Please open the door. This is Rodriguez from the Taj Hotel staff. You're absolutely safe now. Ma'am. We're the NSG. We're here for you. - Ma'am, please. - No... They'll kill us. They'll kill all of us. Nothing will happen to you. We are here for you. Please come. Don't worry, Mrs. Khan. You're safe. Suhaan, take care of her. Sir, those screams... I think they are guests. Careful. Hello. My name is Shirley. Shirley? Shirley? Shirley... Are you okay? We need to go. - Ali. - Yes, Javed. Inform Hafeez. We're safe here, okay? It's horror on the country's financial capital... Did you have your lunch? Hey? You haven't even touched your food. Why? What's happening? Everyone at the party was talking... NSG? Sandeep? Dhanu! Sandeep is a training officer. They don't send training officers on such operations. No. Do you want some prasad? - No. - By the way, Sandeep called earlier. - I didn't pick up. - Why? What do you mean, why? He doesn't even have time to talk to me. Always thinks about his duty. He has a duty towards his family as well! He was busy yesterday, so I'm busy today. That's it. - Calling paramedics. - Captain, location? Chamber's club. Over. They'll have to pay for every life they took here. We move systematically. Bottom to top. Ground floor to fifth. Hurry up! Let them get closer. Bomb! Run! Team Alpha has been ambushed. I repeat, team Alpha has been ambushed and Major Khanna has been injured. We are firing, but the terrorists have escaped towards the south block. - Any casualties? - One hostage down, sir. How do the terrorists know our movements? They're pretending to be the NSG and killing hostages, sir. They're killing faster. Media? Delta team heading to north block. Somebody tell the media to stop broadcasting our goddamn movements! Now as you can see, the police and MARCOS are surrounding areas near the Taj. The NSG commandos are wearing their Nomex uniforms and bulletproof vests. Our correspondent Ram Kishore will share more information... - Sir. - Are you following the news? Our NSG commandos are wearing black Nomex uniforms. I want everyone in black clothes. The NSG uniform is black. I am already wearing black. - NSG! - We are the NSG! There is some suspicious chatter on channel 48, sir. - Gather everyone in the north block. - Okay. - Has everyone changed? - Yes, we have. Sir, this is Kelenke from Mumbai ATS. We just got an Intel. Terrorists are moving all the guests to the north block. SWS, any movement in the north block? Second floor, towards the north block. Sir, they're taking the hostages towards the north block. Target at the center window. Gunshots! I see gunshots! Damn it! Negative, sir! They're using the hostages as shields! I do not have a shot! I repeat, I do not have a shot! - Get in! - Shut up! Shut up! Delta team heading to north block. One and two. Check every room. Gather the civilians at one place. Just shut up! Shut the hell up! Three and four, escort them out through the corridors. - Ali, guard them. - Sir. All the hostages are in the banquet hall. Follow me. This way. Back! Back! Aakash! SWS, come in. Suspected terrorist, red T-shirt, second floor corridor. Copy that. Patch me to someone near the heritage wing. I repeat, do we have eyes in the heritage wing? Over! Major Sandeep, come in. You are the only one at the heritage wing. Copy. I'm with a hostage, sir. SWS has spotted a terrorist there. Patching you to SWS. Don't worry. Ma'am? Are you okay? - Eagle 2 for Tiger. Come in! - Tiger copy, over. Suspected terrorist, red T-shirt. Second floor corridor, heritage wing. I don't have eyes there. Careful. Quiet, please. - He took my jacket. - Jacket? Quiet, please. I would have shot you as soon as I saw you. But I wanted to kill more of your people in one shot. Where is the rest of your team? Why are you alone? Tell me! Tell me! Put down your gun! Put down your gun or I'll kill her! - Ma'am! Are you okay? - Major! Are you hit? Aakash, take care of the hostage! Major is hit. He is bleeding. Major, come in! Major, where are you? Major Sandeep! Come in! Major, come in! In pursuit of the terrorist, sir. Looking for him. - Aakash tells me you've been hit. - He is getting away, sir. Major, listen to me! Sir, he is in this block. I can find him, sir! Major Sandeep, I repeat myself. You've been hit! Do you realize that? Major, do you read me? Major, respond! It's just a scratch, sir. We need to check on that, come to base now. We don't know how they'll ambush us. You are of no use to anyone dead. Sir, just listen to me... Our duty is to protect others and ourselves too. These are your words, Major Sandeep. Come to base, it's an order! When is daddy coming? I promise. We're going home very soon. - Javed, someone ran on your floor! - Which floor? Ummati! I remember this door was open. Now it's shut. NSG! NSG Commando! This... I'm going to put you back in there. These are bad men. Quiet! Ummati! The key. Did you find anyone? Looks like they ran away. Where will they go? This is the inner side of the hotel. - Did you check the hall? - I've sent Iftekhar there. - Did you check the bathroom? - Yes, there's no one. Listen. Sir sent orders. We have to check the passports of all foreigners in the north block and find out who the Americans are. Why? They are our insurance. For us to get out of here. Aakash! That terrorist in a red T-shirt and Grey hoodie - escaped through the service corridor. - On it, Major! Veer! Take care of the hostages. - Are the doctors attending to them? - Yes, sir. Don't move, sir. Major, please! You are losing a lot of blood. The bullet grazed your neck. One inch to the left and it would have been... The person you are dialing seems unavailable... - Hello? - Hello, sir. - Yes, Isha. - Sandeep is not answering my calls. And the NSG is in Mumbai! No, he is a training officer. They don't send officers to such operations. I think he'll call back then. - Yes. - Okay, bye. But the fun is after the wedding, right? - Can't wait for tonight. - Really? It's our wedding, but look at everyone else's excitement. Sandeep! Did you pack your bags? You have to leave in the morning. What? Hey! We are married. Come with me. Why don't you give it a try? - Excuse me, sir. - Yeah. Colonel's enjoying his birthday. You're happy, right? Sit down. At first, I thought you were unhappy because it's a new place. Then I thought, maybe it was the new lifestyle. Now I feel it's because of me. They offered me the job again, Sandeep. Senior Architect. Better salary, better position. I'll reject it tomorrow. Guys! Great news! Isha just got a huge promotion from her company in Bangalore. Wow! Congratulations, guys. Thank you, sir. Thank you. If you wanted to reject the offer, you would've said no already. Congrats, Isha. You wouldn't wait until tomorrow. - Congrats, both of you. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. - Congratulations. Thank you. Happy birthday, Isha. Sorry, I wanted to make it, but they canceled my leave at the last minute. It's okay, Sandeep. It's just a birthday. I miss you. I miss you. Anyway, you are coming next month. I'll be there next month for sure. Yeah. Bye. The number you're calling has been switched off. Congratulations! This subscriber is currently switched off. We've been trying to reach him for three days, dear. But sir... We have been trying to reach him for three days now, ma'am. But we don't know where Sandeep is. What do you mean? How can you not know? This subscriber is currently switched off. Please try after some time. Ma'am? Are you okay? Ma'am! Careful, ma'am. Please! Hello! Hello, Isha! Sorry, Isha. We were ambushed on our way back to the base. We lost two soldiers, and we were stuck there for a couple of weeks. There was no mobile signal. We finally made it back to the base. Are you all right? Are you okay? Yeah! I'm okay. Are you okay? Yeah, of course. I'm fine. Where are you? I... I'm at the office. I have a meeting. I'll call you back. Hey, Isha! I love you. I'll see you soon, okay? What happened at the hospital that day, Isha? Why won't you answer me? You should have been with me in the hospital, right next to me. I was at the forward outpost, Isha. - Mom and dad... - Not them! I needed you here. Not on the phone. Here! With me! Alright, Isha. Your Sandeep is right in front of you, and with you. What happened? Were you... Were you pregnant? Did we lose someone? Please tell me something, Isha. Tell me... Stay back. Sir? Stay back, and I'll tell you. Sir. We have to go now. It's an emergency. I'm sorry. He couldn't find out what had happened to Isha. He couldn't be there for her. Because, beyond being a husband, beyond being a son, he was a soldier. What a soldier gives up, what he sacrifices is something only a soldier knows. - There is so much more to be done and... - Sir, we lost Rajendar Singh. The terrorists ambushed him. Boys, we have bad news. Captain Rajendar Singh. As we all know, he was one of our finest. The NSG commandos are getting off the chopper. Aakash, inform his family. We need to hand him over. Everyone is equipped with advanced weaponry like SIG, RIF551 and MP5 guns. The MP5 is a close range gun. With a range of 50 yards. MP5 is a gun with a range of 50 yards. Stay 50 yards away. They are getting off the helicopter. The terrorists have shot the first NSG soldier. How are the terrorists getting all the information about what's happening outside? Not without you, Rajendar Singh. We saved most of the hostages. They are safe. But a few are still stuck back there. So, the NSG commandos are here, and the hostages... Yeah. I mean, a few hostages are still in there. Sorry, sir. Sir, can you tell us what's going on in there? Sir, what's happening in there? How many people have died so far? How many? Not everything is about TRPs! All you think about are your headlines! - Sir... - Human lives are at stake. Their families are scared. But you are only worried about your breaking news! Do you have a family? I don't understand. I said, do you have a family? A father, mother, siblings. Someone? Yes. I have a son. I saw a five-year-old inside. Dead. He was killed. An old, blind man with his service dog. Killed. People are still holding on to the hope that the Indian government and Indian commandos will save them. So, please, let us do our job! Your negligence is putting lives at risk! But for you, "live" is more important than life. Listen Back in there, at the mezzanine floor, near the swimming pool, there are twenty four hostages. They are trapped. They are waiting for us to save them. Try to understand. Murali. Turn on the camera. We just got an update that twenty four hostages are still trapped on the mezzanine floor, near the swimming pool. Those twenty four hostages stuck on the mezzanine floor in the north block... Four in the north block and the rest in the south. How many of our guys can you send? Swimming pool? There's nobody here. Let's look for them. Get down! Out! Out! - Are you okay? - We're okay, sir. Eagle 2, is he in your field? Do you have a visual? Negative, sir. I'm right outside. I'll kill anyone who moves! Eyes to your left. Eyes to your right. He's still here. No! Sir, why is he not shooting? Get back! - Thanks, Eagle 2. - Roger! They killed two of our guys near the pool, sir. Go to the room upstairs! Now! Let's get him to the hospital. Quick! - Yes, sir. - Major! I thought every man was looking out for himself. - But you... - Aakash. You're badly hurt. You're bleeding. We need to take you to the hospital now. Now! Let's go! They broke the lock. Ali? Do we still have everyone? Sir, the banquet hall is empty. They knew we were going towards the swimming pool. Who died? Sohail, Shoaib and Nazeer, all three were killed. They planned the whole thing! We have to save every hostage in the north block in one single shot. Let's trap the terrorists near the swimming pool. Near the swimming pool, twenty four hostages... Let's not listen to the Indian media anymore. Sir, I need reinforcements, I don't have half my unit. Can't just wait and watch. Please call me back, sir. Sir. The north block is in our control. Sandeep! Half of our team is shattered. Alpha team is injured. That's the latest update. Sandeep. - Sandeep! Major Sandeep! - Yeah. We've got orders. No more operations tonight. - But sir... - Orders from the seniors, Sandeep. Tomorrow morning, we go again. We'll get the bastards. Indian officials say all this was managed by only... The number you're calling is currently switched off. - Isha, hi. - Sandeep! Where are you? - Your dad told me you're in Manesar. - Yeah, I'm in Manesar. Did you get the papers? Isha. - You and I are... - There is no "us" anymore, Sandeep. We are going in different directions now. You think of me only when you are off duty. Everybody talks about your sacrifices, but what about the sacrifices we make so you can do your duty? Isha, I've seen your sacrifice. I feel it. If we have problems, let's fight. But we can't let go of each other. We used to say this to each other, and I'm saying the same thing. I've always wanted to keep you safe. How will you save me, Sandeep, when you're not even here with me? That day at the hospital, you should have been by my side. I thought you would be with me. I was alone then. I'm alone now. I was alone there. I'm alone here! Alone! I will be there. From now on, there will be no more secrets between us, I promise. What really happened at the hospital that day? Let it be. It's better if you don't know. Major Sandeep, Colonel wants you in the hotel lobby. Hotel? Lobby? Sandeep, where are you? Are you in Mumbai? You're in the Taj? Let it be. It's better if you don't know. I will see you. Okay? - Sandeep? - Bye. Sandeep? This number can't be reached right now. Listen to me. Get the information from the police. - Yes, sir. - Hello. Can anyone hear me. Hello? This is Rodriguez from the Taj staff Who is this? I'm Pramoda from room 585. I have a little girl named Shirley with me. She is unable to breathe. It's very dark. I found this walkie-talkie with the security. Pramoda? Pramoda Reddy! I checked you in, ma'am. Where exactly are you? Here in the corridor. It's been more than twenty four hours. When will you get here? - This little girl is not... - Ma'am, we are trying our best. Stay where you are. We will come for you. Please tell me your exact location. I'm on the fifth floor. I'm scared, when will you get here? I have this little girl who can't breathe. Her situation is getting worse. She might not survive if you delay any further. Do something. I'm alone here. I'm alone. There is nobody here. Please do something. Please, I'm alone. I'm listening, please... I was alone there. I am alone here. Alone! Pramoda, can you hear me? Pramoda? Please come in. Pramoda? Pramoda, can you hear me? Maybe there is someone there. So she's quiet. We should save them at any cost, or the terrorists will find them. But sir, she doesn't stand a chance. - She is alone... - No, she isn't. Sir, we have two more hostages up there. Negative, Major. You're not going up there. Do you know how many terrorists are up there? No, you don't. So, we are sitting ducks. It's night, and we wait. But the terrorists won't wait before killing them, sir. How are you sure the terrorists did not make her call us? What if she is calling because she needs help? How the hell do you know it's not a trap for our soldiers, Major? I will never be able to call myself a soldier if someone loses their life because of our inaction, sir! I won't be able to forgive myself. Our soldiers are of no use to anybody dead, Major. I understand you want to save them. What did you say? I said, I realize you want to save both of them, but getting to them is very complicated, Major. How can I save them, sir, when I'm not even with them? To save others, we need to be alive, Major. While they just have one principle, to kill or be killed. And they've proved it time and again. As your superior officer, I'm asking you. How many more soldiers should I be willing to lose? Tell me, Major. Tell me, Major, I'm asking you. How many soldiers should I be willing to lose? To save them, how many soldiers should I be prepared to lose? One! What does it mean to be a soldier? Is it just about courage? Or is it to inspire courage in others? No matter what! No matter what! This is what our Group Commander Shera believes in. - Veer! Cover fire! - Yes, sir. - Boys! - Sir! Iftekhar! Tear gas! Javed! He has come in! Ummati! Moved to the second floor, sir. Ali! He is here. On to the third floor, sir. Ummati, did you see him? Ali, did you? No, Ummati. Pramoda, I heard you. I'm here to take you. The girl you're holding is Shirley Stations. You saved her life. You saved her. Ummati! Ummati! Careful, there are soldiers! Come on! Ma'am! Move! Ma'am! Now! Ma'am, give her to me. - Aman, I'll get the paramedics. - Yeah! Will she be okay? We are checking, ma'am. Let's go. Ma'am! Major, come in! Hostages are safe. We are coming up. Stay back! They have a clear shot of the door. Hold! Major! Are you there? Major. Can you hear me? - Major? - Wait. I'm here. Is he dead? - I don't know. - Either way, he is trapped. He's dead if he tries to go upstairs, and we won't let him get out. This is the only way out! He's here, Javed! How many are there! I think there are two of them! Ali, watch the door! More of them will get through. How many are there! He blew out the elevator panel! - There are commandos out there! - We are trapped! Go check. And kill him. Ali! You watch the door. I'll take care of him. Give me the gun! Get me up! He won't stop! We have to kill him! Let's go! Boys! What's going on? Colonel, we're trying to get in, but the terrorists are firing nonstop. They have a clear view of the door, but we don't have a proper shot of the door. Major Sandeep, come in! Major Sandeep, do you copy me? How many soldiers should I be willing to lose? How many more soldiers should I be prepared to lose? Major, how many are there? Do you need any backup? Don't come up. I'll handle them. Javed? Sandeep. Wake up! Mom. Mom. D-Dad... Couldn't you have waited a bit longer? I couldn't wait, Dad. Weren't you afraid of going there? You're there for me. And what if I wasn't? You'll always be there for me, Dad. You're my commando. He has come all the way in, sir. He is very aggressive. I don't want to die, please do something. - Get me out of here! - Sacrifice yourself. By God's grace, you will go to heaven. - Sir... - You understand me? Sacrifice yourself, and go to heaven, my child. Sacrifice yourself. Looks like the NSG have killed one of the attackers. This may well be the beginning of the end here. The siege is certainly over. You've been saying you don't know. When will you know? I've been calling since morning! Dhanu! Fight back terrorists with whatever resources they had with them. Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, National Security Guard commando will always be remembered for not hesitating to sacrifice their lives. Mom. Mom. Mom. He didn't sign it, Isha. Take care. Ma'am. It belongs to mom. I stole something from you. Sandeep! When he was a child, we always told him to say "I'll be back", not just "I'm going". That last day on the train, he simply said... "I'm going." I wanted to show my son the world from my shoulders. But today, he showed us the world from his shoulders. Long live Sandeep Unnikrishnan! Long live Sandeep Unnikrishnan! Long live Sandeep Unnikrishnan! Long live Sandeep Unnikrishnan! Long live Sandeep Unnikrishnan! Long live Sandeep Unnikrishnan! Long live Sandeep Unnikrishnan! We didn't want Sandeep to join the army. But today, when I look at the faces of the people he saved... Those people, who he inspired... Shirley? And all those who call him a hero... I realize, Sandeep was right all along. We just saw Sandeep's picture next to Gandhi and Bhagat Singh. My son is not as great as them. But I can proudly say that he was different. Gandhi didn't know he would die, but my son looked death in the eye and said... "You can take my life, but not my nation." "You can take me, you can take me, but not my country!" "My country will not bow down to enemies!" Today, I sat where his life was taken by those cowards. Thinking about him. Not his death, but those moments in his life, his smile, his child-like nature, his mischief, and his journey. My son, Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan. He shouldn't be remembered for how he died, but for the way he lived. My son should be remembered for not the way he died, but for the way he lived! There was something about him! Are the Pakistanis drinking during the day? Why are they firing? Sir, Sandeep was at the forward outpost, but now he is in no-man's-land. Sandeep's playing cricket with their kids. Go back! We are warning you! Send our children this side! Indian army! Go back to your side! Captain Sandeep! Come back! Anwar. We'll play again. - Bye, Brother! - Bye, Brother!
