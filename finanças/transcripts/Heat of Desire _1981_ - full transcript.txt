It was some time, in the 1980?s... There was a "revolt". Philippe Muphand, champion of law and order offered himself as the man of the hour. "Do not be swayed by defeatist propaganda".? "We shall take the helm with firm hand".? and spread... The girl is waiting... She waits outside. Let her wait... You see I?m busy. "Brothers an sisters in combat and in hope". "All together for the National Renewal".? Perfect. Very effective. I'll see you later. No... I'm tired of being your "shield". After four years... scruples? I'm not for sale. I don't understand. You've always known the situation. My affection for you... Listen, Pilou... I'd prefer the first clown who passes by! You hear? The first one... Him! "The first clown who passed by... was me." I had crossed the path of King Bullshit... ...the wise guy calling for calm. There was panic in the air... ...especially at the stations. Number 41... 41... ticket window 3 41... you just called it Just a second. Then? Mr. and Mrs. Laine... Couchettes for Barcelona on the Talgot. No more Talgot... just an ordinary night train. Laine... there. 1200 francs. It was me she was looking at... ...hypnotic as a fire. I had signed for a well-paid lecture in Barcelona. For my wife and me... a second honeymoon. The "Revolution" could wait. Hello? Hello... It's Serge. Yes. Where are you? In bed... I'm in bed! An accident? No... I'm at a hotel. What's going on? I don't want to lie to you... I've met a girl Something happened! It's difficult, I have to... To what? I'm going to Barcelona with her. It is hard. Bon. Get up, I'm going by to pick up my lecture notes at home. Do you have to? I'd be lost without them. It's there... Wait here... It's best if I go up alone. Excuse me... is my wife upstairs? Yes it is. With her mother and your brother... Ready to explode, I'd say. They'll get over it... See you later. Can't go up... Family war council! Your lecture...I'll have to ad-lib... I knew about life from books... My wonderful books... the great adventure! Lined up on my shelves... I had cheated on my wife only with books. "The family is the rampart...." "...against the evil that is rampant" Serge! Nicole, stay here! Serge! The toilet! Come out of there... Talk to me, Serge! It's too easy. You can't run out on me! Your "conquest" looks like a hooker! Calm down, Madame... you'll break your keel. It must be out of order... You mustn't carry on like this, Madame. What a lousy trick! Won't even talk to me... Give me that, you jerk! Some people sense danger... not me. Her presence made me carefree. No, stop. I wanted to conquer her... to pretend I had started it. Where's the dining car? For once in my life, I felt fine Everything seemed simple... Monsieur, we have to close before the border. I have two singles but that's expensive. Perfect. We'll take them if they communicate. If you'll follow mw... I have no change... Thank you! If you need anything, just ring. The latch! In the name of God! Look, "cambio", you can change money. I suddenly realized she could disappear as she had appeared... The hotel's not far, we can walk. You need underwear and a razor. First the hotel... We'll see after. I want to buy some leather pants. I wanted to be alone with her... In a vacant lot, a coal mine or a room... but just us two. Bonjour. Mr. and Mrs. Laine... we have reservations. Ramon Martinez Russel... ...Rector of the University... Monsieur Laine? My wife, Carol. I am very honored. Welcome to Catalonia. Since you are invited by University... ... so this is for your expenses. Nothing to do with your fee... just some pocket money. I trust it's sufficient. I hope you are not busy for lunch. My wife would be very happy if... If so, it is taken. We have to see... ... my mother. She lives in Barcelona? No, but she's often here. I understand. I'm worn out... I'm going up. Your wife is very young. I wasn't listening to him... I was thinking about Carol and the room. Please explain what is happening in France... Here, we do not understand the situation. We have time... I'll see you before the lecture. I'll call you and we'll make a date... okay? Agree? Good. Goodbye. Thank you. My card! A child's face, a woman's body. Shithead! Should be the first right... I do not understand anything. Ah! Wait for me... For Carol, tourism meant buying... Anything and everything. Got any pesetas? Yes, yes. Good, come. There's your church. The guidebook... You?ve got it. La Sagrada Familia, didn't interest her... That day, it didn't show me much, either. Listen... are we going to stay in this dump? If he wakes up, we'll look good. When she took charge money was no object. But I was too happy to make waves. That's just fine. For you, sir. Carol? I'll finis what I'm reading and be right there... One second, I said. I said I'm reading an article... I'll come up after. You can't lock me up in here. Who locked you up? I went down to read a newspaper... I'm not the kind of woman you hide. I introduced you as my wife! Don't exaggerate... I'm not... so watch out! For what, for who... for you? I don't get it? I don't get it. Stop it. What? Turn that off! I hate music... Come fuck me. What? Come fuck me. What are you doing? Her imagination kept surprising me.... Imagine a pinball in love with its flipper. Come play house with me. Come, come. It was my childhood. It was my happy childhood she was re-creating for me. The time seemed brief, yet infinite. I have no desire to be anywhere else. Last night I couldn't sleep and I started thinking... I know nothing about you. I said: I don't know anything about you You never read Little Green Books? I remember one that had short stories... news. It was my favorite. My brother tore out all the endings, so I made them up. Each time I re-read one, I'd change the end. It was a dream... adventure. It was called Tales of the South Seas... Jack London. Yes. Diner, Senor. Before the door, please. Hungry? More gently... Being an intellectual, I was surprised... The more she gave, the more I wanted. You know what? Sometimes you scare me... that violence! I can not, I. I still knew nothing about her. When I asked, she answered with silence or silly stories. ...in a derby hat, eating an apple Is that all? It was wild! I never dream. Only psychos never dream. She was afraid of phone calls... It was a bad omen. But our childish games lulled my fears. D-7? Nothing. How, "nothing"? Beside, buddy. That can't be right, you were hit at C-7 and E-7. You're right, I hadn't seen it... Sunk! Concentrate... I've got a headache as it is. You won... happy? Take off your glasses! You can see without them. Yes. The caviar, Senor. Leave it at the door. The bill... it must be paid right away. Give me my money. Oh... "Salada" Not the "Salada", the caviar. Yes. Serge, what are you doing? Brushing my teeth. She never sleeps? Why the telegram? To warn me she was leaving? The thought left me weak. Gently. Gently. It's nothing. Serge, wake up... You sleep all the time, this is not funny. Excuse me, I... don't apologize... it is not worth. My tooth hurts, I hurt... I want to sleep. Never wake up. I've given you everything, Serge. Why did she suddenly want to go out? I was as weak as a convalescent on his first outing. Had our delightful illness lasted 20 minutes, 20 hours or 20 days?. I want to read it, too. I've got that one. This is silly. I'll lend you mine! Do you mind? What's wrong? See what's happening in Paris? They won't raze it. I have to call home, though... So... you love your little wife? What took you so long? I'm hungry! You should order. Should've ordered! I don't care what I eat... Incredible how decorated parts of Paris are...! Good. Choose! Don't talk to me like that, stop ordering me around... Anyway, I'll have squid. The tourist there wants squid I'll have eel... and a suckling pig. A whole one? And rose wine... Gerone. Know how much money we have left? You might take it a little easy. Please. The tourist finds my order too expensive... What do you have that's cheap? Sick... completely flipped out! Really cheap... for cheapskates! If you want to fight, go outside please. See what you've done? I've lost my appetite...! Ciao! Sure... take off! You are going, right? Get away from me! It's over, with these tips? Let me out! Madame, monsieur, please. She knew how to make her point. But I was past the point of no return. Better a bum trip than no trip. So to hell with my lecture. I can't think straight... and there's you And you, what'll you do all alone? Senor Martinez? Hold the line... Monsieur Martinez? Of course! I haven't forgotten, but I couldn't... ... contact you! We changed hotels. Yes, that's right... Tourists. Lecture Hall 27, fine... Good, good. Tell me, senor Martinez, forgive me for asking... Tomorrow, if you could... I've lost my wallet! Stolen, no doubt. So... In pesetas. In pesetas. Yes, in pesetas. that is pesetas... Yes. Believe me, I'm sorry to have to ask you. What? Not in our contract? Neither are thieves! Yes. Hasta maniana, senor Martinez. Am I ever in the shit! I need the book. I'll never get. You're going bald... do something about it. Ever notice how in love affairs... ... you never have time to shit? As if... Everything is ok? Are you ready? Not staying? I'll be out front. I understand about the theft, but... ... haven't you any notes? Everything was in my briefcase, but is doesn't matter. How, doesn't matter? Are you serious? You have the book? Pages are missing We cut out some quotes. Doesn't matter. Listen, Mr. Laine, I'm very disappointed... You're not respecting our contract. However if you want to cancel your lecture... ...with the situation in France, we'd understand No, it's time. Let's go... Some voyages never end... ... some you never come back from. I don't have any answers. I'm up here but I should be sitting with you. Perhaps I can help you clarify your own thinking... ... but it's probably too late. I was worried. Carol wasn't there. Why had she insisted that I give the lecture? she must have an idea behind the head. Mr. Laine, please stick to the subject... ... without all these useless digressions. What about initiatory trips? Indulgence for adventurers, to quote James... Perfect. I have nothing more to say. Read the book... you know as much as I do. Isn't alcohol a key? And what's become of tenderness? Have you seen my wife? I've seen that you are a demagogue and an imposter. You fooled those innocents, but not me. Just give me my money. I don't see you! You don't exist for me... I advise you to disappear as quickly as possible. Asshole! Asshole! Swine! Please... have you seen my wife? She's French with curly black hair... 512... Isn't my wife here? Didn't she leave any message? Is the Senor sick? I cleaned the bathroom Do you need a doctor? What time is it? 2:30 in the afternoon The Senora... My wife? French newspapers? Downstairs. Sorry, monsieur. All money transactions with France are suspended. We can do nothing about it. I have to get back to Paris! My wife... Do I look dishonest? Sorry... it's impossible. What a country... Why is it called a "free fall"? Pushed into the void by Carol I wasn't free. An now? Go straight... no, turn left. Impossible... it's one-way. Turn right, then. Returning to Paris would be pure hell... My toothache was a foretaste. Stop... stop here! I can't... it's illegal! I can't stop here. Stop, damn it! Crazy! Didn't even wait for change.. Hello, hotel Colon? Mr. Laine. Have you seen Senora Laine... Yes, yes. You haven't? Yes, okay... Up yours. You? Everyone's deserted me, Rector. Let me in to explain. I still don't know what happened to me. It must seem ridiculous and childish, but... Imagine someone like me with a girl like that... ... uncultivated, interested in nothing It's as though You were to... I don't know... Or you, Madame! I wasn't myself, but I had no right to... All my life I've been... And yet I... Famous. "God, give a drink to those "drunks who wake at dawn..." You've told me a story worthy of a novel... ...one of those serialized "true romances". But I've decided... to end it... I'm going back to Paris. Grave events are taking place in Paris, Senor. My wife will understand, and forgive me. I know, Senor, you didn't like my lecture I haven't forgotten, but... No, I didn't like it. It didn't seem to me to be... at university level But if you could lend me enough for my train ticket... I apologize Monsieur Laine, I'm not a brute. But you must swear you will take the train to Paris. I can trust you...? I swear it! Cough. What does he said? The doctor is a dental surgeon. So he's not... Stomato? Consul? Repatriation? Not consul, consulta To take care of your teeth... No! I'm not going to be butchered here... I want to go home! Please, Laine, calm down. No, no and no! I want to go back to Paris tonight! So, without question. Hello, hotel Colon? No drill, Martinez... no joke! You weren't nice to the doctor, my friend. It's excusable, you need a day's rest, at least. Take this... you'll feel better. You'll use my son's room, he's on vacation Our old Europe is very sick, too I felt punished; I could only think of Carol, ... and it was torture But I couldn't stop myself from hoping. I assure you the doctor is a top specialist. He diagnosed a serious infection. He'd like to examine him at his office. I'm sick! The Rector can tell you... You know Dr. Monin warned me. I'm on anti-biotics... right. But you promised me yesterday... ... to return to Paris. He gets everything wrong. He even, swore it, Madame Laine. You'd be better off at home. Nicole, I'm worn out... I'm in a bad way I'm in a terrible state. Don't I look it?... Can you see me on a train? Those smells... It would be torture! We'll take a plane! Grandma will help us out... A plane? Oh, no... no plane! He's faking... He plays the comedy. Louse... Bastard... Liar! Don't touch me, Jeannot. Senor Martinez! Go get dressed! Sort of asshole! Go get dressed! Simulator! My wife and my brother, a resume of the past... ... I wanted to be rid of. There are limits...of pleasure! I warn you, Nicole, if that clown says another word to me ... I'll leave the room! Did you hear me? I warn you. Forgive me... ... for hurting you this way. It's finished, Nicole. Do you understand, Nicole? I've turned the page. You won't come back? We were going to have a child! We had just decided... You creep! Madame Laine, this is all very painful and I... Listen to me... Listen to me... Look... I'm very calm. What happened to me in Paris, before... that wasn't me. Understand Nicole? It wasn't me... Something happened! And now I've crossed a line... I'm on the other side. Good or bad, I don't know... but I don't see you any more. Paris, all that... the house... it's not in my program any more. I haven't chosen the easy way... the future isn't rosy. It may drive me mad, it may wreck me... ... but I know it's worth trying. I want to live that life! I want to live! Do you understand? It's mine... No one has the right to take it from me. Come on, he's totally irresponsible. That's it "irresponsible". I claim the right to be irresponsible... That I want. Poor Serge. Bastard! Go on, get out... Beat it! You bum! Laine, sincerely, I must say I admire your courage... To turn your back on your past, what strength of character!. When you start to flip, go all the way... If I had any scruples, I'd never find Carol again. Hello. 512. No message for me? A moment. The young lady has not returned... ... but the cost of restoring the room has been charged to you. If you wish to stay here... ... you must pay for the room daily. Send up a bottle Get up, lazy! Know what time it is? What day? Thursday... it's nice out. Where were you? I won't kiss you till you shave. I'm glad to see you... I missed you. What's your brother name? Max. Why was he there? A guy was supposed to take him to a producer in Almeria... He's a photographer... wants to work on westerns. No photographers in Spain? I couldn't tell you, so I left word with a student. I should've known better. I tried to call you, but in the mountains... you know... Were you camping out? Yes, wait! When we got to the hotel there... ... I couldn't recall the name of this one. Don't believe me? Yes, yes. When did you get back? This morning. And your... brother? He's in town... I talked about you, he wants to meet you. Really? It was all a lie... but she was my drug. A junkie who needs a fix doesn't ask questions. Okay, little sister? Max Moineau... Carol told me about you. So you found him! She gave me a hard time... "Where is he? He'll be worried..." "I left without a word" No movie work for you? Sure! But I'm not interested I don't need it. Take our picture? Listen... Yes, yes, yes, sure, my sister and my brother-in-law. Stupid pictures! His heartiness made me itch. Better... the arm like that. Watch out, she's expensive... Don't lose the ticket. Those two spelled trouble. Then we go! Your glasses. Go on, kiss her. Kiss her on the mouth! It's good, it's good. I'm giving my brother a present... It's hideous! You can really be a drag! How much is this. We'll take it... I'll pay you back! Did you tell him? I can't! I will... Nice, huh? You're not very loving with my sister... You should enjoy it while you can. What does that mean? That "lover" doesn't rhyme with "forever". We'll split it. I'm broke, didn't you tell him? Is it expensive? You're smothering me. "Mothering you? Want me to mother you? It's good. Awful day!. I still didn't know what they wanted... ... but I had eliminated the brother. Open up... it's me. What? My pal's making out with a Swedish chick... At my pad... Got a bed? You're starting to bug me. Don't get up-tight... Caroline is here? Max? My pal's making out, with a Swedish chick... Take the couch, an leave us alone. Turn out the light. Is he your brother or your pimp? We ever going to lose him? Don't mind me! I know how it is... I'm used to it. Think you can do this to me? Get the fuck out of here... now! You pay my head? Shh! She's asleep... Now what? "Now what?" Beat it! Beat it or you'll be sorry! Shut up, Serge. It's not so simple. You think this is easy? You're really possessive, as man. Afterward, you'll come cry on my shoulder. You're really a loser! He's playing Othello! Beat it! You too, Carol! I'm sick of you! Sick, sick! You make me vomit! Enough now! Come on, go! Now the problem was to stay mad so as to void despair. Max Moineau... work here.... Dark... trench-coat, clic-clac... Crappy pictures! This is for you. So it's tonight. France's left hand was fighting its right hand... I couldn't have cared less. I do not give a damn. I had a date with my life. You look great. You too... it suits you. After this story, I was afraid you'd be mad at me. You aren't? What a mess! I'm not asking you to explain. I accept you as you are. Look... I thought of you. It's a new edition: not as nice but... ... terrific to have found it here. "Having read these tales, who "will be bold or young enough..." "...to really go and explore the South Seas"? At last a night of love. We may have the same dream. Come, we'll rebuild our hut. Save your strength for tomorrow. I wondered what she meant by that. Her continual reversals intrigued me... raising more questions Our reunion was magic. Anxiety only increased our tenderness. I loved her as never before. At first, I liked it... Always a different man at the door. Mother decided to fix me up... She found me this politician. She sold me. You didn't care? That's right. But finally I told him to shove it. Max is here to take me back. Come on... we'll go find the bastards. Good Lord, what time is it? 10:15, Madame. You're in the dark, my poor dears. There was more in the air than a sordid marriage contract. Hello, darling. Hello. Hello. I'm Caroline's mother. My name is long and hard to pronounce, so call me Helene. Caroline... something to drink, please? My dear Serge, I know all about everything... ... in particular, the exclusive nature... ... of your "liaison" with my daughter. You seem to know what you are doing. But Caroline is still a child. She often goes to extremes without thinking. I know it! Men have confided in me... It's not even iced, how can that be? Never mind, it's just so we can drink a toast It'll bring you luck... That's for your brother. I spun from true to false... as in a game of Blind Man's Buff. I intend more for my girl than casual affairs. Her beauty and intelligence... ... should bring her great joy. So I insist that we find a solution quickly. This kind of soft-soap, kills me.... I had to act before anesthesia set in. My ass! When do you bring on the clowns?. I know what you were up to in Paris... ...Carol told me everything. Control yourself, my boy... we're not in a barnyard. What are you referring to? Is this your new lover? I won't compliment you... Max, I'm shocked. I didn't drink to my brother-in-law... Careful, it stains This boy come here to insult us, Max. My pal Serge?... No way! My daughter has played with you... like a toy. I'm sure you spent a fortune. Yes. You see? Let's speak frankly... Caroline lied to you but it's understandable... If you only knew! Know what? Some secrets one can't reveal... Understand? Not very well. She lives in a dream world... it's her age. She rebels, Though her guardians wish her no harm. She invented everything. Don't fall for it... She's bluffing, look at her. Don't listen to the ingrate. Carol... I want to talk to you. Serge. How long does this go on? As you like it. The guy's a square! I'll decide! If you bug me any more, I'll dump you... Oh, Pilou! You've had your fun! He's coming to power... This is serious, your Pilou. Your choice is clear. You have no choice... You want adventure, excitement... I understand that. Listen, Serge, I'll make a deal with you. Despite some modification of my original beauty... ... I retain some vestiges of my youthful charms. Out of the question! I know your virility... Another word and... Carol! Oh, what the hell do I care? He's really a drag... Always in our legs. She used you... Forget her! We're living. We're going. Wait. We're going to a nightclub! Castanets, sangria... Quick bickering... let's go. Lovely! But I've nothing to wear... Pitiful. Such cheap compromises in the 20th century... Your pessimism is getting depressing... Pour us a drink. Let's dance. I can't dance... I'd look like your asshole brother! Come on! No. I'm bored. and I'm bugged! What was that screwball Carol playing at? Why were we there? Care to dance, Senorita? No. Make up your mind. Por favor. I'm with you... not anyone else Por favor. He wanted to dance... not fuck. You never understand anything! What's wrong now? Always the professor! Let me introduce the Countess Jose Verano de Costes... My sister Caroline, Serge. I gave her one of my jackets... Looks good on her? Her father's a ship-owner. I'm not involved in my father's business... I'll leave that to my husband. And what do you do in life? University prof... A good one... "University"? In what field? She asked what field. I'm not deaf! I teach literature and philosophy? Philosophy? Yes. Why teach philosophy to the young? Philosophy is wisdom... That comes with age You can't just abandon me! Wife, kidnapping! Stop! This gentlemen says you're kidnapping the girl. What's wrong? Our daughter's a bit drunk we're going home... Lies. She's my fianc?e! Ah, the good Serge... National Renewal! A little dignity, after all! You're shaking like a leaf. Release us... This is too big for you to handle. Con-men! You're common thieves.... The young lady loves her fianc?e... Here in Spain, we are chivalrous. Where are you staying? Why did you lie to the Municipal Police? I'm a friend of Colonel Ramos. Your chivalry will cost you a great deal! As the enemy army increased, it got weaker. Things were looking up. To the station! I'm sorry I doubted you. What's wrong? You're indestructible... Two seats... first train to Paris Impossible, all trains are blocked at the border. Impossible... there's a strike in France. For how long? Indefinitely... Read the papers. What'll we do? A civil war. Sleep. We couldn't go back to France, or stay in Barcelona... Carol was drugged but I was enjoying the excitement. Now I knew Carol didn't want to leave me. When you're like this, huddled against me... ... I feel I protect you. Me, too. You, too... what? Feel I... protect you... Me? Why? Do I seem weak? Where can we go with no money? We won't need any. What's wrong? Nothing. You seem far away. No. Yes. Love isn't the same every day. Now what? You don't know everything, Serge. I don't want to. It would be a marriage of convenience. Pilou never touched me, he's strange He has to be married, to get to the top politically. Did you understand? He's ready to pay. Nothing would change for us...! I don't see myself as a pimp! You're cute when you're mad. You want me for yourself... you really love me. Listen... What do you think, Carol? Shit... Think. After the wedding, we'll take the money and run. Get the hell out of here...! Go, go, and get the hell out of here! Go! Serge, don't spoil everything. Back. Get away from me... you disgust me! What did I ever do to you? Are you taking revenge? Listen, you're a stupid bitch! Don't talk to me like that, Serge. What am I doing with a clown like you? A dreamer... who doesn't trust me! Come on... Caroline! Why go through all this for a little whore? Screw you! I'll hitch-hike back to Paris... Up to now, I had tried to be logical.... That was an error. A man of action doesn't think. That was what Carol needed. So I disguised myself as a hoodlum. Where's Carol? She doesn't want to see you... she's come to her senses Mardi Gras already? The wedding is tomorrow. I never hit a woman! Took you long enough. Now I understand. I have to compromise you... Anything... I trust you. A fortune... 2nd closet. Enough chit-chat... Hurry up! You'll learn that love, is measured by what you sacrifice for it. Where are the others? Beauty and the Beast? Forget them, they have no class. Where as you... Affaire of state, my boy. Caroline understand that, this is a important mission. Superior interests are at stake. You're a dreamer... I'm a man of action. Let's go. The boss needs to be whitewashed... he will be. Question of politics... you wouldn't understand. I thought it was money. You'll get your share... and you'll be satisfied. Like everyone else. You don't know what love is! In Indochina... ...a woman sold to a white man, if she loved him... ...would slowly poison him... ...and give an antidote at the same time. If the man left her, he'd be minus his antidote The poison would take effect and he'd die. Like a victim of a spell. So I'm going to die. No... because, Carole is letting you go. Everyone has problems in love. They pass! I had them go... I was young... It ended badly. Look. A dagger did that... Here, feel! Feel! Ruined my kidney... I kid you not. I was dodging bullets, too. This is for you. If you want a promotion, I'll put in a word for you. You make me sick. I make you sick? I used to feel that way... it doesn't last Don't be a fool! It's loaded, you know. You scared me... Careful, that's dangerous! Open, damn! Open up or I?ll shoot! Hopeless! Hopeless! You're hopeless! Forget it, it's all there... Lock him up! You gambled and lost. Farewell, ma Caro. The strike's over, train at 20:10... Goodbye, Sis! In each man there's a killer... mine never been aroused. But I was ready to start a war to get Carol back. Oh, damn! I have to pee! You again? Son of a bitch! Bastard! Watch your language! I'm your elder... Come on, get up! It's not easy to kill a man. Veins. To the port...! The ship's name was a good omen. Free of those schemers we could finally be happy. The money was gone, but, Carol didn't seem to mind any more. How will we live? Debauchery is a disease... You've been infected. Oh no! She had played her hand well. You're in the family now. Off to Eden with the Queen of Tarts and her 3rd-rate knave... But my new fatalism and their silly clothes removed the sting. Your cabin's on this deck? How amusing... so is ours. My apartment in Paris, my books, my wife ... were barely remembered. I was far away... a cosmonaut orbiting in Carol's love. The future wasn't bright but I'd escaped something worse... Never knowing happiness. Two years later, on a street in Zanzibar ...Serge and Carol ran into a ragged but happy man... It was Senor Martinez...
