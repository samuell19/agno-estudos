Singapore is a "con"-temporary city. Either you con or you get conned. But I'm still the best in the trade. After all, I'm the managing director of two investment companies. How else can I afford my house and car? Dear! - If I don't have gift of the gab - Hubby! would I have such a stunning fiance√©? Look at her tummy. I'm responsible for it. That's why I'm marrying her. Today we're taking our wedding photos. You look gorgeous today. You should top it off with this. I have something for you too. I, Chin Wu Huang, take Teo Bee Poh as my wife today. We're from Commercial Affairs Department. You said you'd be back very soon. I didn't expect the judge would sentence me to ten years in prison either. You must take care of yourself! Name: Chin Wu Huang Nickname: Huang Age: 33 Convicted of: Fraud Sentence: Ten years What are you trying to do? I'm going to make a "cake". What, haven't seen someone take a dump before? Do you want to eat it? Damn it! I can't do it with you staring at me! Damn! Name: Ong Beng Kwang Nickname: Kwang Age: 40 Convicted of: Illegal gambling operations & vandalism Sentence: Ten years Excuse me. This is my territory. Feels damn good. Newbie? You're new here? What's your name? Chin Wu Huang. - I'm Nam Nam. - Nam? The one taking a dump is Kwang. - Okay. - He's a loony. He'd go on a violent spree in the middle of the night. Okay... thank you. - You must be careful! - Oh, yeah. - Beware. - Okay. Was that crazy woman bitching about me? No! Be warned, you'd better wear two pairs of shorts tonight. Why? He has a "microphone" fetish. What are you doing? Don't be scared. We're going to live together for so long. I can help you satisfy your needs. I don't have any needs. Y-You don't, but I do! Give me a kiss. I'm going to wallop you! I like violence! You can hit me while I kiss you. Help! Help me! Help...! Stop making a din! We'll be punished if Ma'am hears us! I was just pulling your leg! I don't like men! I told you. He's not into this. My toilet paper. Can't I pay you back later? It's your fault that I lost the bet! Did you wash your hands after you took a dump? Watch your words! I'm all for hygiene. I always wash my hands after taking a dump but not always after taking a piss though. I used to be the one duping people outside. Little did I expect that I became the victim on my first day in here. There are all kinds of people here. I have such a long way to go. How am I going to live through it? Sis. We're going to stay here for so long. If you're horny I can give it to you now! Come! Help! I was just joking! Just joking! Fat hope, I was just joking! Have you run out of new ideas? He's a regular here. To him, the prison is like a hotel. Bugger, you were just released last month. Why are you back again? Just my luck. I met a scatterbrained cab driver who laid his keys around, so I tried my luck. I didn't expect a silly-looking man like him would have nice house. He had cable TV so I could watch soccer matches. Most importantly, there are tons to eat and lots of money to pocket. I was about to go but his toilet looked inviting so I took a dump and a shower. Unfortunately... That's my story. How unlucky can you get. Look, I'm Hwee. Name: Goh Chun Hwee Nickname: Hwee Age: 40 Convicted of: Repetitive housebreaking Sentence: Two years Brother Hwee. The worst experience of prison life is when your loved ones visit you for the first time. The pain is heart-wrenching. Come nearer. Let me look at her. She's so adorable. Everyone says she looks like you. She was only 3.1kg at birth now she's 6kg. Sit... Honey. It's been hard on you. Don't worry. I'll take good care of her. I'm sorry. I want to hold you but I can't. You must be a good girl. It's hard on Mummy to take care of you alone. Does she have a name yet? Not yet. I'm waiting for you to name her. Xiaowei. Call her Xiaowei. Xiaowei? Beautiful name. - Xiaowei. - Xiaowei. How are you? Good! The government treats us well. We enjoy good welfare here. There's food to eat, a place to stay and work for us to do. And we can even take classes to upgrade ourselves. We always have three dishes, a bowl of soup and a banana. The only downside is... What? There is no room service and we can't check out as and when we like. Is there anyone wooing you? No! It's all right if there is. Anyway, we're not officially married. Xiaowei and I will wait for you. It's okay if you have suitors. Just don't lie to me otherwise I may go crazy. How did it go? Was it "glass" or "mirror"? What's that? "Glass" means you kissed, separated by glass. Right. "Mirror" is this. Come, let's demonstrate. Come. Honey, you must wait for me. I will. I'll definitely wait for you. Okay! That's so mawkish. You're making me puke! I'll show you something. My daughter at six months old. She's a looker, eh? She has double eyelids, you don't. She has a button nose, you don't. Her face is round, yours is oval. Are you sure she's your child? If not? Yours? You're crazy. She's so adorable. Can I be her godfather? - Count me in! - You too? That'll make her "daughter of bandits". Hey! I dare you to say that again. - It's a joke. - A joke? Men are bound to get off track in life at some point. That's not the worst. What's worse is not knowing how to get back on track. If I can start anew I'd choose the righteous path I see it so clearly now The lament of losing freedom If I can start anew I won't want a sorry fate I'm not without regrets Freedom has a lesson to offer Looking through the iron bar Ponder over and think far Looking through the iron bar I realise how much time was lost Question yourself about the reason for this The only hope now Is to leave this regretful place Casinos are Always the Winners - Hey! Look! - What? The government is going to build a casino. They've run out of ideas. Doesn't the government discourage gambling? Gambling dens always get raided. They're building their own casino soon. That's why they must kill off their competitors. I know. It's called "monopoly". Whatever it is, they are the boss, they can say what they like. In the past, they say casino was the bane of social order. Now, they say it's more a "bank" than a bane. Well, they are always right. But frankly, this may not be a bad idea. It's better than regretting it 20 years later. Singaporeans love to gamble. Instead of going to casinos elsewhere keep the money within the country. No! They're building an integrated resort. Not a casino. It's just a name. A casino, by any other name, is still a casino. According to the news report the casino makes up only 3% of the resort. Yeah right! Take away that 3% and how much do you think that 97% would earn? Peanuts! Hey, watch your words or they might lock you up. We're already in here, what's there to fear? Exactly! You know what? The government stole my idea. Singapore's first integrated resort (IR) came into existence in 1997. I mooted the idea. You could dabble in blackjack try your luck at dice, horse-racing machines and the Chinese's favourite game, Mahjong. If you're tired, you can go sit on a massage chair. If you're hungry, there's a buffet spread. Kids can play arcade games. And I didn't impose an entrance fee of S$100. Singaporeans could even enjoy discounts. You were so bold! Weren't you afraid of being caught by the police? The police were no match for me even if they had sent in the riot police. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to Binbin Happy birthday to you My goodness! You're a hero, man! Braggart Kwang! You sound so convincing. How did you land yourself in here then? One word, unlucky. That's my story. Why didn't you take a good look? I didn't know that was the handicapped parking lot. Ma'am is right. Gambling will cost you your life. If you ever gamble again, you're done for! You think I've not learnt my lesson? If I gamble again after my release, I swear I'd castrate myself! I mean it, why won't anyone believe me? Bloody hell. I heard our new Ma'am is a beauty. Yeah right. I bet she either looks like a monkey or has a face that looks like it was ran over by a car. Or she has a face ravaged by a dog. Here she comes. From today onwards - See what I mean? - Madam Yeo Hwee Wen will be your new OC. Hello, inmates. I respect every one of you and I hope you'll accord me with the same respect. Looks like a movie star. If I catch you doing something wrong I'll only give you one chance. If you're troubled or have any difficulties you can always come look for me. Goh Chun Hwee, see me later. Yes, Ma'am! See? I'm getting special attention. Don't get jealous. Good afternoon, Ma'am! Come in! I read your medical report. You are very healthy. Thank you, Ma'am! I'm strong as a bull. Good. Goh Chun Hwee. Your caning will be executed on the day after tomorrow. I'm craving laksa! I want to have roti prata. I'm craving prawn noodles. I really miss eating cockles. What, can't I crave cockles? Humans eat cockles Humans eat cockles Humans take a dump Humans take a dump Cockles eat the dump Cockles eat the dump Humans eat cockles Humans eat cockles Hey! Don't be afraid! It's only six strokes! The first stroke feels like a bicycle hit you. You won't feel a thing at the second stroke. How did you know? You were caned before? I've been in here for so long of course, I had heard about it. Hey! A man shall shed no tear. Don't shout or cry when you get caned. Why? Because if you cry, you BLP! What's that? BLP means you have no balls. Oh, I see! Your English has improved. You bet! I attend two English classes per week. Hwee, be cool, okay? If I were you, I'd go in like a man. Have some balls. I support you! Okay. Of course, thank you for your support. Ma'am said after me, it's your turn. Goh Chun Hwee, you were sentenced by the court for repeat offence of housebreaking and hereby, you've been awarded six strokes of cane. Is that correct? Yes, Sir. Can we begin now? Yes, Sir. Bloody hell! Hit by a bicycle? It felt like I was rolled over by a lorry! Be careful... Here. Poor thing. I thought you said it wouldn't hurt? It's all hearsay! The second stroke was better, right? Try it for yourself. It got worse each time. They applied medication. You'd get better. Or do you need a pretty nurse to comfort you? Can I? Yeah. In your dreams. Good afternoon, Ma'am. Just lie down. Thank you, Ma'am. Look after him tonight. Inform us if he runs a fever tonight. Yes, Ma'am! Ma'am came to see me. That shows she cares about me. If she was the one executing the caning I don't mind taking another ten strokes. Fancy fantasising in this state? I'm already stripped of my freedom. Can't I even fantasise? - Ouch. - Why? Your buttock hurts? No. I need to take a dump. Shit! That'd open up his buttocks again. Do you really have to go? Yes. I can't hold it in anymore. Quick...! - Quick! - Hurry... Careful! Quick! Otherwise, he's going to pee in his pants! Careful! Easy! His foot! His legs are in the hole. Help him get out. Help him take off his shorts. Slowly. Greet Daddy. You're so lousy. Hey. Don't be rude. She's right. I'm a lousy father. I've never even hugged her before... since she was a baby. How are you? I'll be released in a few months. Xiaowei and you will wait for me, right? You and Xiaowei have been my pillar of strength in the past seven years. This pillar must not fall. Your daughter has grown up and your wife treats you well, lucky bastard. You're not so bad yourself. Your wife Lian is good to you, too! People say we are the Bonnie and Clyde of the gambling world. Although I'm not married, my men queue to visit me every day. They want to see if you're dead so they can take over your place. Can't you say something nice? Hwee, you've been here for so long. Did you have any visitors? Instead of studying hard, you went to steal! I'm going to teach you a lesson! You thief! Useless bum! You're hopeless! When will you ever learn? Why must you steal? I've given up on you. How did this happen? You're a good-for-nothing... Mother, I'm not a good-for-nothing. Kwang. Kwang and I will be released in two weeks so we're giving out sweets today. Two more weeks to our release. Here. For you. Huang, what about me? All yours. All? These were all from you. Now, I'm returning them all at once. I hope this is the last time. Don't come back here again. You too. Your turn. Seven years whizzed pass just like that. There was only one TV station back then. Now, there are two. Good for you. I have two more years to go. What's so good about that? You can't find a job and you get despised. I'd rather stay in here and live off the government. Ma'am, when I look for a job outside must I mention that I'm an ex-convict? I'd suggest you tell the truth or you'd have more explaining to do if they find out later on. And I don't know if I should say these. Just speak your mind. Ma'am, we get well-balanced meals here at the Changi Prison. We wake up early for morning exercises daily. And we go to bed early at night. If we sell this concept to slimming centres and have them recruit people to sign up for a weight loss programme in Changi Prison Changi Prison will definitely profit from it. And you have so many unoccupied prison cells. During weekends and holidays small families can come and stay for three days and two nights to experience prison life. Changi Prison can profit from it again, yes? And you have that Yellow Ribbon Programme. We can print the logo on T-shirts, paper bags singlets, shorts, dresses, cutlery, etc. These could bring in revenue for Changi Prison. Then, Changi Prison will be like Changi Airport. The airport has Terminal 1 and Terminal 2. Changi Prison can have Prison 1 and Prison 2 We can have many prisons. You have interesting ideas. Given the chance, I'd suggest it to the Director. Good. If that happens, can I have a 5% copyright fee? Life is short and we had wasted seven years of it. You bet. After your release, don't be a conman anymore. Lead an upright life. Speak for yourself. Don't think you're King of Gamblers and end up losing everything. Deal. If you won't con, I won't gamble. On. If you won't gamble, I won't con. - Lian. - Honey. Kwang! - Lian! - Kwang! Let me take a look at you. Gosh, you're so heavy. Honey. - Honey... - Aren't you going to take a shower? Yes, Ma'am. I'll make it quick, okay? Honey. Don't. It's been seven years. Don't you want it? I'm having my period, I can't. How timely. Are you hungry? I'll cook something for you. Then, I'll go fetch Xiaowei from school. I'll go instead. I want to give her a surprise. I'll go get changed. You're back, Lian. Hello. How's your luck? Bad! I've already lost over S$1,000. You'll win it back. You can afford it. Why are these people gambling here? It's easy money. I get 10% from everyone. I can easily make a few hundred a day. That's it! Stop! Scram! Get out! - You're crazy! - Go. Scram! Get lost! I'm so sorry. What's wrong with you? Are you mad? You lost your senses in prison? Gambling is not everything in this world! There are other things we can do! See what I mean? There are things we can do other than gamble. I'm no longer the Kwang I used to be. So we have to change our habits. From tomorrow onwards we shall lead a healthy gamble-free new life. It's been seven years. Today, I'm fetching my daughter from school for the first time. I'm not a good father. Xiaowei, I promise to fetch you from school every day from now on. Xiaowei. Here, give me a hug. Xiaowei, he's your dad? You said he went to war? My dad just came back from Iraq this morning. Daddy's an army officer. He's very brave. Uncle, did you meet Saddam Hussein? Yes. I was there when he got captured. It was a perilous situation. We had to dodge the bullets. So, I had to negotiate with him until he surrendered. What about Osama? He's selling otah now. You know what? I can't tell you too much. Or I must silence you. - My dad's here. - Bye. Hey. When you tell a lie, you need to cover it up with ten lies. When you tell 10 lies, you need to cover it up with 100 lies. - Kids... - Must not lie, right? Don't worry. My classmates are pea-brained. They'd believe everything you say. Hey. Let's go and have fun, okay? Okay. Let's go. Daddy, this is great. I wish we had one at home. I'll buy one for you when I have the money, okay? What's this for, Xiaowei? It's an electronic menu. We can use the computer to place an order? Impressive. Let's dig in. There are so many movies to choose from. Which do you prefer? - This one. - This one? Can you appreciate French art films? The newspapers gave it a 4.5-star rating. A 4.5-star rating? Daddy, why are there so few people? I thought they gave it a 4.5-star rating? A 4.5-star rating is equivalent to 4.5 patrons. Look, there are four adults here. You're a child so that's half. So, there are 4.5 patrons. Excuse me, can you stop snoring? I'm sorry. Did I disturb you? Yeah. I need to sleep, too. This Bee Cheng Hiang outlet is so huge. Shall we buy something to eat? But, Daddy, we just had lunch. But I haven't tasted BBQ pork for seven years. Auntie, 1kg of this, this and this. Thank you, Miss. Let's go home. Mummy would be very glad. Mummy, I won't skip tuition classes again. Stop hitting her. I brought her to the movies. You're already setting a bad example on the first day of your release You taught her to lie and skip classes. Honey... Honey. Kids must not lie. Daddy, do you know what special occasion is next Tuesday? Next Tuesday? I don't know. It's Mummy's birthday. Mummy's birthday? What does your mummy like? Mummy would stop and linger outside jewellery shops whenever she passes by them. Boss. I'm Kwang. I'm here for an interview. What time was our appointment? 8.30 am. What's the time now? Who recommended you? - A friend. - A friend? Give it to me. Just be outright that SCORE recommended you. Why? Afraid that they would know you're an ex-con? Crazy. Everyone here is an ex-convict. He's Big Head. - Brother Big Head. - Drop the word "brother". We're all equal here. He's Dinosaur. He was a drug addict. You're quite a hunk for an addict. I quit, that's why I became so well-built. Here, you must know him. Lecher. He made his maid pose naked for him. I took her pictures with her consent, okay? Too bad her figure was better than my wife's. That's why my wife called the police. Cut the crap. You are a lecher. Period. Dragon's head tattoo. You must be a triad boss. Hello, Boss. What are you talking about? He's my consultant. Nutcase. Consultant? SCORE has arranged a job interview for you. This is the letter of recommendation. Go for the interview upon your release. Thank you, Ma'am. Auntie... Auntie, you dropped your money. I'm so careless. Thanks. You're such a kind soul. Thank you. According to the doctor, her cancer cells have spread. How much longer can she live? She has two to three months left. Does my brother Huat visit her? It's been a while since he last visited her. Mother. You're here? My son. - Mother. - Why didn't you come visit me? Mother, lie down. Take your time. Huat, I miss you every day. Do you know that? Mother, I'm not... Huat, I'm so happy to see you today. Mother, I'm not Huat. I'm Hwee. Hwee? Hwee? That good-for-nothing. He refused to study. He's a thief. I yelled at him. I hit him. What can I do if he doesn't want to listen? Why do you have such a brother? Huat. When are you taking me to your bungalow? After the renovations are completed. I want to see your bungalow now. How about some soursop? - I want to see your bungalow. - Rambutan? - I want to see your bungalow - Tomato? Your bungalow is in Ang Mo Kio? That's right. Here, have a tomato. What's in your hand, Mother? It's my precious. Don't steal it from me. I won't. I was just asking. I have nothing left. My precious is all I have now. No one can steal it from me. No one. All right, I won't. Don't worry. When can I see your bungalow? I'm looking for Goh Chee Huat. - Who are you? - I'm his brother, Hwee. Sir says he doesn't know you. Please go. Ask him to come out! Sir, please don't stand there. If you don't go, the police will come. This is our latest design. There are ten diamonds on it. It symbolises "perfection". The lady who receives this will definitely be touched. Is there a discount for this? This is the discounted price. How much is this worth, Boss? Thank you, sir. You're welcome. Smells good! Xiaowei, it's Mummy's birthday today. - Shall we give her a surprise? - Okay. You'll go switch off the lights, okay? - Okay. - I'll go get the cake, okay? Okay. It must be Mummy. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to my dear wife - Happy birthday to Mummy Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, Mummy. Thank you. Xiaowei, look what I've got here. Hello Kitty's VCD. - Like it? It's for you. - Thank you. - What should you say? - Thank you, Uncle Mike. You're welcome. Is it an original version? Daddy, there's a sticker on it. Hi, I'm Mike. Huang, Chin Wu Huang. He is like family to us. That's why I invited him. It's your birthday. The more the merrier. You're so kind. I feel awkward. You may go if you feel uncomfortable. I'm just joking. Here, sit down. I'll bring out the dishes. This sauce tastes great. I know you like it. I made it with fennel fruit, cinnamon, pepper, soya bean and brewed it in prawn sauce for three days and nights. There is only one word to describe the sauce "unsurpassable". You're a great cook. Teach me something. I don't teach any Tom, Dick and Harry. Daddy, you're lying again. You used Tai Hua's seasoning sauce. Honey, have a drumstick. Xiaowei... I'll eat it. You lost, Daddy. I'll eat it. I'm full. I need to make a call. I have a million-dollar deal to close. Have a good meal. Give me a pack of cigarettes, handsome. S$11, please. S$11 for a carton? Does this look like a dozen to you? Can you give me a discount? Sure if I were the government. I can't even smoke a cigarette. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Go ahead. Uncle, please smoke outside if you have to. Can I eat it in here then? Have you found a job? Don't lecture me on this now, asshole. You'd better stop harassing Bee Poh. Or I won't go easy on you. I won't fall for someone who thinks violence is the answer to everything. Okay, I'm sorry. What must I do so you'd marry me? Bee Poh will marry whoever can bring her happiness. Don't be a snob just because you're handsome. Don't fool me. You're not as good as you look. Okay. Since you said so. Then, all's fair in the war. Fair, my ass. You're no match for me at all. I'm the man of Bee Poh's life. Xiaowei, I have a question for you. Do you like me better or that... You, of course. Really? It's a white lie. Hey. To be frank, I hardly know you. That's true. It's all right. Starting from tomorrow we'll get to know each other better until we know each other inside out, okay? Alright. I'll continue to be your dad if I hit bull's eye. But if I miss you'd have to have a new daddy. Take it. It's okay. I'll throw it then. Okay? I don't believe I can't hit the bull's eye. Who did that? Who did that? I know you hate me but I can give you parking tickets till you're dead! You come out now! What do you think? Do I need to go to the hospital? Yes. - Hospital bills are very expensive. - Yes. - It's better to just die. - Yes. Since the war has been declared, I must give it my best shot. With my qualifications I can easily find a job as a manager. You have a criminal offence? Yeah, I just came out of prison. If you give me a chance... I will definitely do my best. I won't disappoint you. I regret to inform you that the manager position has been filled up. How about the position of assistant manager? Actually, I don't mind, you see? But the manager minds, you see. I can be a janitor, too. You don't mind being a janitor? Sorry, that job is contracted to my company. - Kenny? - Brother. This is my new name card. Chairman, Apple Co? What's this about? Read the news lately? An old lady was cheated of S$160,000. My downline was responsible for that. What do you mean? They asked her to touch some stones. And when the colour changed, they told her "Auntie, you contracted cancer." That'd scare her out of her wits. By then, you can squeeze her dry of her money. How can you cheat old folks of their money? Don't you have any conscience? Such is the reality of our society. The genius preys on the ignorant. The Gods bless the ignorant. What's more, I donate part of the money to charity. I don't want to be involved in this. I'll never do something like that. Hey, I'm trying to help you. Don't forget, you're an ex-convict. No one would hire you. Thanks, but I can deal with my own problems. Well, so much for trying to be nice. Okay. My door is always open. Think about it and call me. Okay? Bloody hell. It's a plastic name card. That's a lot of cockles. Have you forgotten? Humans eat cockles Humans eat cockles Humans take a dump Humans take a dump Cockles eat the dump Cockles eat the dump Humans eat cockles... Let's dig in. Hey. You guys are so uncouth. Who are you? She's my wife, Lian. Says who? We're not married. We're as good as married. - Hello. - Hello. Frankly speaking, I don't know what she sees in you. You're one lucky bastard. She's the lucky one. She found a man with three legs. What are you talking about? - You know what I'm talking about. - You're crazy. - Uncle, three bottles of stout. - Okay. Uncle, your cash drawer is open. - Thank you... - How much is it? S$17.40. Here. I won S$50. - You're so lucky. - So lucky? You won a prize with the first bottle you opened. Another S$50. My friend told me that it's a 1-in-1000 chances to win a prize. And I struck gold twice already. - Fine. You have a knack for it. - Rubbish. I bet you can win something in every bottle. I'll show you. Did you win anything? "Thank you." I don't believe I'm so unlucky. Wait! Let me try one bottle. I bet you didn't win anything. I didn't win S$50. I won S$100. - Really? - Really. Boss, one crate of stout. "Thank you". "Thank you" again. Wait. Let me try the last bottle. I don't believe you have such good luck. Did you win? S$100. You have the luck of the Irish. You're damn lucky. Wow. I won S$300 in total. Beer's on me today. Come on. Don't blink. Make your choice and place your bets. No more bets. Open! - One more round. - The dealer lost. Up the bets! Paying you ten bucks. How much must I pay you? Come on. Give it a try. Don't get conned, let's go. Hello. Have a go. You may win money. Come here! What's on your mind? - I made a pile. - Don't worry... The dealer's so lousy. You promised me no more gambling. Don't worry. I won't gamble. I was so lucky when I was opening the beer bottles. I just want to confirm if I'm really so lucky. Reveal. We're really on a lucky streak! Look! If we don't keep our winnings, we're not gambling, right? Let's go. Hello. Listen to me, Brother. We're cool. You must keep your winnings. I have a bigger den upstairs. You're sure to win a lot. Don't try to tempt us. We don't gamble. Listen, I'm not asking you to gamble. Treat it as an eye-opener. The casino is not open yet. Let's warm up first. You don't have to pay S$100 entrance fee. Are you done talking? Let me tell you. I won't invite myself into the tiger's den and let it devour me. You think I'm nuts? Big... Won't invite yourself into the den, eh? I know, but if we don't how can I be sure that there is a tiger here, right? We're just taking a look, we won't gamble. Excuse me. I say it's big. Open. Four, five, six, big. - What about this? - Big. Reveal! Five, four and four. This round can't be big again, can it? It follows a pattern. Big. Three, five and five. Big. The next round should be small, I guess? Should be big. Big! Last call for bets. No more bets. - What are you doing? - We mustn't gamble! Five, six and six. Big. See? Don't try to be a smart aleck. Isn't it a pity? Come on. Wait. Open. Big... Big... Big... One, four and five. Ten points, small. The dealer doesn't win every time. Take it. You can borrow some more anytime. That was an accident. Let's try again. Just once. Damn. What rotten luck. Had I known, I wouldn't have borrowed from loan sharks. Had I known, we shouldn't have gambled. Had I known, we shouldn't have came here. Had I known, we shouldn't have dabbled in "Three Kings". Had I known, I wouldn't have let you drink with them. You might as well say I shouldn't be released. Had I known, you shouldn't even been born. If I were all-knowing, I'd be the president. Had I known... Had you known... Had you known, you'd be a psychic! - Why are you yelling at me? - Why push me? - You yelled at me first. - What are you doing? Hey... Stop fighting. Don't lay your hands on women. Hold our temper and we can hold wealth too. Hold my ass! I owe the loan sharks S$5,000! It's only S$5,000. You can recoup it easily. Dealers can't be lucky the entire time. Stop asking us to go gambling. Don't you try to entice me. I'm no longer the Kwang I used to be. When you reach the end of your tethers that's not the end. It's just the beginning. Really? Everyone has a chance to strike it rich. God wants to bestow you with a gift but if you don't give yourself a chance how could He bestow the gift to you? Understand? Class. Today, you'll write about your father. - Siwei. - My father is a doctor. - He treats patients. - Good. - Meishi. - My father is a CEO. - He attends meeting every day. - Very good. - Xueying. - My father is a lawyer. He fights court cases every day. Xiaowei? My father is a soldier. He is very brave. He can shoot. Teacher, she's lying. Her father is an ex-con. No, he's not. My mother said so. Your father swindled people's money, that's why the police got him. He has never been in jail! Isn't that Xiaowei's father? He was jailed for cheating people's monies. He's a bad guy. Let's go. Xiaowei. Come on. Let's go home. What's wrong with you? Can you... not fetch me from school anymore? I'll wait for you from a distance. Is that okay? Will this do? Here? Here? We cannot tell if we're lucky or not. "Meng searches to no avail for her husband." Ominous lot. Fret not. This is only the second deity we asked, right? There are so many deities in heaven, right? Ominous lot. Ominous lot. Auspicious lot. Heaven has given us the go-ahead, let's go. Excuse me. No more bets. Open. Five, five and six. Big. Four, four and six. Big. Three, three and six. Big. We're different from others. We know how to control. We still have a few hundred after paying off the debt. Enough to last us for one week. We mustn't be greedy or we'd lose money. Hey. Another S$50. Really? Looks like we're really blessed today. Looks like we're onto something today. Shall we go for more? We must exercise control. We mustn't end up like last time. We mustn't be tempted by the devil. We won't be enticed. Right. Not over S$50 anyway. - Damn it. - What's the matter? S$1000. There's no reason to refuse money from heaven, right? - Time to rock and roll. - Quick. S$50,000. We owe the loan sharks S$50,000. You still have the mood to drink? Okay. Calm down. We must examine our mistakes. Examine, my ass! It's S$50,000! The interest is over S$1,000 a week. How can we repay the debt? How? Damn it! When I was winning, why didn't you say anything? Who was the one yelling "big" just now? You had the time of your life just now, didn't you? You said you were no longer the Kwang you used to be! You could have stopped me! Stop, my ass! You've contributed to the money we lost! So, how are you going to repay the debt? You can be a gigolo! You can be a whore! What? - Damn it! - Hey...! I can introduce Bangladeshis to you. Cut that out or I'm not going to be nice! How dare you retaliate! Go to hell! Die. You'll surely die this time. I will never die. Luckily I wore a helmet, right? Huat, you said you would take me to your bungalow? Try and fulfil your mum's wishes if you can. I think you know what I'm trying to say. Excuse me, do you sell bungalows? Yes. How much does one cost? S$5 million. S$5 million? So expensive. Can I rent one for S$50 a day? Bastard! Die! Go to hell, Kwang! Will you die if you don't gamble? I... I only gambled a little bit. A little bit? If so, they'd have let you off on my account! Things wouldn't have come to this state! If so, you wouldn't have screwed me up! A little bit? I started with just a little bit. But they kept urging me to carry on. So, I ended up betting more. You mean, it's their fault. Not yours? I did tell myself to stop gambling. But they say I have no balls if I stop! So, you are the victim, huh? - Yes. - Yes, my foot! Did they force you at gunpoint? You just bloody want to gamble! It's their job to ask you to gamble! You should control yourself! Leave! I don't want to see you here! Please give me a chance, boss. Let me tell you this. Of all my workers you're the worst, the most useless of the lot! Building a casino is one of the most effective ways of stimulating our economy. The compulsive gamblers only makes up 3% of the total. The public shouldn't worry about the social problems this 3% may cause. Damn it. So, we're part of the 3%? Another "Thank you". You cheated us of our money! You're the cause of our desolation! Let's go. Damn it. What happened? Who whacked me? Xiaowei, do they serve your father drumsticks in the prison? Of course not! They don't eat drumsticks in prison. Dad told me those got thrown in jail are those who committed heinous crimes. Other than swindling, did your father steal? - Rob? - Murder? Oh, I know. He was a peeping tom. You should have told me that you were fetching her. I thought she got kidnapped. You got me worried. Here, lunch. Mike and I will fetch her from now on. What about me? Her classmates are mocking her because you're an ex-convict. So what if I'm an ex-convict? I can't fetch my daughter from school? I can't help that her classmates are childish. But please spare a thought for Xiaowei. She's just a child. I don't want her to get jeered at every day. If you had a decent job, things may not be as bad. It's not as though I'm not trying. People just refuse to give me a chance. What do you expect me to do? The employment rate is so high in Singapore. I don't believe everyone rejected you. Stop having me on! One more thing. Mike and I are getting married at the end of next month. Huang. What do you think are our chances? Look at the supervisor and I know we don't stand a chance. Need you ask? It's not easy to find a job. So, what do we do now? How would I know? Save some for me. I only took one bite. You look like a refugee. Coffee. I'd never expect it'd be so hard for Hwee and me to find a job despite tons of available openings. No matter what, I must beat Mike. How did we end up here? I don't know. I just followed you. I thought you wanted to fetch your daughter. I walked this way instinctively. Let's go. Hey, your daughter! - Hide. - Why? - Don't let her see us. - But why? Her classmates are mocking her. Because you're an ex-convict? You're so silly. Since you're here, just go fetch her. Don't be a busybody. Look, your wife! Hello... Hide...! Daddy. Hide...! For what? They saw us. He's here again. Quick. Let's go. I thought you forgot, so I... Why can't you stop lying? Let's go. What kind of rule is that? Ex-con can't fetch his daughter from school? Let's move it. Damn it. They found us. They have a wide network. We have no choice. We must sell the house for cash. I've checked with the housing agent. He said times were bad so he couldn't find a buyer. What should we do? What other options do we have? Do you think avoiding our calls will solve your problems? When will you pay up? In three months. - Don't hit him! - Please stop! In three weeks! Stop hitting him! Please! Please, I beg of you, stop! Kwang! If you want to see her alive, redeem her with money. You have three days or we can't promise what we'd do to her. - Kwang. - Lian. Don't worry, Lian. I won't let them hurt you. Hey! What do you want? I really won't let them hurt you. Don't worry, I'll save you. - Lian. - Stop! Say no more! Or my face will be smashed. Please, think of a way to repay them. I should be happy to celebrate my daughter's birthday for the first time. But Bee Poh chose to hold the celebration at Mike's house. Daddy, look! Uncle Mike brought Sakae Sushi home for me. There are only four of us. Is there a need to go to such an extent? Isn't this better? We can celebrate in peace. You're late again. We're waiting for you to cut the cake. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to Xiaowei Happy birthday to you Here, Xiaowei. This is for you. Wow. Thank you, Uncle Mike. - Do you like this camera? - Yes. Xiaowei. This is from me. Do you like your name, Xiaowei? I gave you the name. Is it a nice name? Be brave and take your first step. Don't be afraid to fall. Go. You're already two years old. The first time you called me "Daddy" I was so happy I couldn't sleep that night. Mummy said you were very popular in your nursery school. Like parents, like kids. You seemed to have lost weight. You must eat more, understand? It's the school holidays now. Did you go on a holiday with Mummy? Remember to take lots of photos to show me. Mummy told me you're helping out with chores. You're a good kid, unlike your Daddy. I'm sorry I could not attend your Sports Day. I promise I will be there next year. "At long last, our family is reunited." "Life is good!" Have more. This camera is packed with features. Can we remain a family? This can't do. If I can find a job soon Bee Poh may change her mind and not marry him. Mr Chin, you may go. We'll inform you of the results via telephone. Will you really call me? Of course, we're a government agency. We'll definitely consider your application. If you don't want to employ me, just tell me right away. Don't tell me to wait for your call and give me false hope. Didn't the government encourage private companies to employ ex-convicts? If government offices don't set an example would the private companies dare employ ex-convicts? Mr Chin... I promise I will work very hard. I won't cause you any trouble. Please go, Mr Chin. We'll call you in a few days. Stop asking me to wait for the call. If you don't employ me, my wife and daughter will leave me. I can't help you either. I have a wife and children to feed too. The judge sentenced me to ten years in prison. You people sentenced me to death! I'm unable to take your call right now. Please leave a message. I will call back as soon as possible. - Is this the last one? - Yes, that's the last one. Why can't you stop lying? Can you not fetch me from school anymore? Xiaowei. Daddy. Take the umbrella and wait for your mum here. Don't run about. Don't tell Mummy I was here, okay? Be careful! Don't run about! Daddy! Thank you, Daddy. Don't worry. Kwang and I will help you. Kwang. Uncle, two cups of kopi-O. - Huang, I... - Let me go first. Hwee's mother is very ill. She wants to stay in a bungalow. I want to bring her to a bungalow. - He has a bungalow? - Him? Hell, no. My wife's boyfriend, Mike, is outstationed. His house is empty, so we can bring her there. He lives in a big house? What's there to be happy about his big house? I'm just happy for him that he lives in one. You shall be his driver. I'll be his assistant. We'll put up a good show for his mum, okay? - Okay? - Okay. Are you sure? What if we get caught? It's not our first time. Don't dwell on it. Your problem is my problem. Right. Your mother is my mother. I mean, you never know when her time's up. Sorry. Your mother will live to a ripe old age. Mother, here we are. - We've arrived? - Here. My house. This is it? It's huge and very nice. Good afternoon, Boss. Good afternoon, Madam. Huat, who is he? He? Madam, I am his personal assistant. My name is Steven Gerrard. Sorry to interrupt. Boss, this is the two-million dollar contract. And the client needs it now. Can you sign it for me, please? Well, okay. Thank you, Boss. What did he say, Huat? He's speaking English. We speak English in a bungalow. Come, let's take a look inside. Okay. Please. You joker. A two-million dollar contract? It's just a show. We might as well dramatise it. I wanted to say S$20 million. Why are you dressed in this in this hot weather? Are you mad? You don't watch Korean serials? Have you seen Winter Sonata? Bae Yong Jun was dressed like this. That was Winter Sonata. You are "Cuckoo Sonata". Let's go. You have terrible dress sense. What a huge house. Look, there are fish. Yes. How beautiful. Huat, who is he? Why did you pose with him? He's our Prime Minister. I'll show you upstairs, Mother. Ma'am, let's take the lift. - You have a lift in the house. - Yes. Mother, look. This is my room. You have a big bedroom. I'll show you to your room. Right, run along. My room? All right. Here, Mother. Have some more. You're Ah Gua (transvestite)? Ma'am, I'm Kwang. Kwang. You're... Steven Jialat (terrible)? Yes. And this is? Relax. Sit down and finish your meal. Hello, Auntie. I'm Mike. Oh, Mike. Wu Huang, is she your mother? No, she's his mother. So, she's your mother? Yes, she's my mother. She's not my mother. I have to go. These belong to me. You stole my things? - I... - Kwang. Kwang! Kwang! Mister, sorry. Your parking coupon has expired. What can I do? Exceeded by one minute. I have to do what I have to do. Use your car keys. Your car keys are inside. Yes, sir? Is there anything I can help you with? - Yeah. You see... - Kwang! His car keys are inside and he's outside. So, how... Don't move, sir. Relax. Put down your knife. What are you doing, Kwang? Don't do anything stupid. Watch it. She's innocent. Put down the knife. Don't come near me. Let me talk to him, okay? Kwang, put the knife down. Calm down. Put down the knife. A life is at stake. Put the knife down, don't you understand? Don't you force me! The loanshark cornered me. And now, you? They've got Lian! Yes... Who's cornering you? You cornered yourself! So many people bet on Toto, 4D, soccer and horse racing everywhere in Singapore. Who ends up like you? Yes... When you borrow from the loan sharks you should know you'd end up like this! When they offer to lend you money, you can always say no! - That's right. - Kwang! It was your choice. Stop it! I'm not married yet. I don't want to die. You shut up...! Kwang! Calm down! Kwang! There's still hope for you. Is there? Your phone is ringing Your phone is ringing. Answer your phone. Someone is calling you. It's my boyfriend's call. It's my phone! My ringtone! Yes... Bloody hell! Trying to avoid my call? When are you going to repay me? I'm robbing someone as we speak! What else do you want from me? Huang, you're right. Gambling will kill me! Here, Auntie. Mother, here, slowly. Mr Driver, thank you for sending me back. Don't mention it, Auntie. Huat, your driver is a good man. You must give him a pay rise. - Sure. - Thank you. - Watch your step, Auntie. - Thank you. Thank you. We trespassed on your house but you didn't report us to the police. I know you were just helping a friend fulfil his mother's dying wish. You're right. Bee Poh should marry the man who can bring her happiness. You're a good man. If I were a woman, I'd marry you too. I concede defeat. Bee Poh should have married you when I was in prison. You'd better make sure you make her happy. Otherwise, I don't mind getting jailed again. Huat, I'm happy to see that you're doing well. I'm really happy. If only Hwee was there too. Hwee is a useless bum. Forget him. He's as good as dead. Dead? Don't lie to me. I've heard it before. Convicts are usually very healthy. He can't be dead. Don't lie to me. What worries me all my life is Hwee. Although he goes in and out of prison please tell him that I've never given up on him. No matter how hopeless he is he's always my child. He's always my child. Hwee, my son. Hwee Hwee, my son. I wanted to give it to you on your birthday. You pawned your watch to buy this ring? This ring has a name. It's called "Perfection". My life can never be perfect again. I can only give you this "Perfection" ring. May Mike be a perfect husband for you. May you have perfect bliss in many more ten years to come. I'll go take a shower. You just came out from the shower. This is for tomorrow. No... I'll go make coffee. This way. Mummy, can I ask you a question? What is it? After Uncle Mike and you got married, can I still call Daddy "Daddy"? Silly girl, Daddy will always be your daddy. He loves you so much. He loves you too. Why won't you marry him? What's wrong? Nothing. Still can't find a suitable one? Every time I try on something new, it seems to look beautiful on me. But somehow the last one always seems to look prettier. What should I do? Do you want to try the very first one again? The very first one? I mean... the one you wore seven years ago. Your imagination is running wild. Do you still love Wu Huang? If you're not ready we can always postpone the wedding. In fact, I'm fine with calling off the wedding. Mike... It's impossible between Huang and me. That was the past. But... Stop having these groundless fear, okay? Come. Let's try a few more. Huat, isn't today your wedding day? Why are you sitting here? Mother, it's not my wedding. I told you just now. My girlfriend is sitting next to you. Auntie. Oh. Good. Huat, you're really capable. She's so fat. What did you feed her? Why can't you look back one more time? Why can't you wave a gentle goodbye You just walk away Leaving behind a mellowed sorrow Why can't you look at me one more time? I yearn to hold your hand again And ask you not to go I wish you could love me like before Tell me whose fault it is Why part if there's love? With regrets, I whisper I wish you could love me like before Why can't you look at me one more time? I yearn to hold your hand again And ask you not to go I wish you could love me like before Are you alright? It's better for her to marry Mike than marry me. Her friends are mocking her because you're an ex-convict. - Do you like this camera? - Yes. If you have a decent job, things may not be as bad. You are the main lead of the show. Bee Poh, Xiaowei and you are a family. All of you are in this together? Daddy, this is a white lie. Okay. I, Chin Wu Huang, will take Teo Bee Poh as my beloved wife. I will love her with all my heart. And from now on, I'll spend all my life with her. Although SCORE has recommended some jobs to me we may have a hard life. Are you sure you want to marry me? You saw it for yourself. So many people are giving you a chance. There's no reason for me not to, right? The parking warden is here. I hit my one-month quota in one day. The machine is not working? Oh, dear. All the parking tickets are deemed invalid. The parking tickets are deemed invalid. Excuse me... Translator: SPECTRA MEDIA
