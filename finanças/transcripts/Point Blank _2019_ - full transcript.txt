Recreatin' the Sistine Chapel in the boy's room? I know, I'm completely off the rails, but I freakin' deserve it. You should be knee-deep in that sofa with some Graeter's ice cream. Will the Graeter's help me finish the nursery like Paul promised? Paul is gonna finish this nursery. Paul said that about the crib. Paul is gonna finish that crib after he finishes the painting... ...with Taryn on the sofa, out of these fumes. Now, can we please stop this third-person bullshit? Language. The baby hears everything. Mm. Look here, little man. Stop it! Will you please kick your mother three times to coax her to the sofa so I can get ice cream for the both of you? "Yes, doctor!" That's a very mature response for you, but I am not a doctor. Yet. The city is reeling tonight following reports of yet another high-profile murder, this time, Assistant DA Joshua Gregory. The police chief is expected to hold a news conference tomorrow afternoon. There is nothing organic about that. - It's all fat. - You want me to take it back? Don't be a smart ass. We're here outside Gregory's home following reports of shots fired, - when investigators got to the scene... - What a mess. - Great, traffic. - ...and discovered Gregory's body. - In Cinci, this late? Really? - I gotta scoot. - What about the room? - When I get back. I'll knock out for a little bit, then dive right into it. You should just record that and play it on a loop every time I ask. Rest. Relax. No murals, no Michelangelo. - And I'll be back in the morning. - Okay! Pops! Youngblood! Big thanks. Better hurry up, man. You'll miss it. I ain't missin' nothin'. Shelter’s overcrowded. That's why I got this. Keeps out the bugs and the thugs. Made it myself. - I appreciate you, Pops. - Uh-huh. So here's the workflow. Pediatrics in bed one, baseball to the head. Two and three, gang shootings. Bed four, mystery man hit by a car. Good lookin', too. - He single? - Find out for me. Got spent brass and bullet strafing for seven blocks. Same with the blood trail. Got a destroyed cell phone. Still searching the rest of the neighborhood. Calling area hospitals now. Masterson. Everybody, give us a beat. - Jones, make those calls if you can. - Go take this outside. I came the second I heard the call go out. I... I tried to stop the bleeding, but he'd already gone too far. Hey. All right. You did everything you could. Joshua was the only good thing in that entire fucking DA's office. I know. Tell me you got something. Nine mil. Close range, judging by the powder burns on the wall. - At least Josh got a shot at him. - Yeah. But whoever took that round is out there getting cured. Jones is calling local hospitals now. Regina, I know this is tough going, but we got it handled. Why don't you go home? I've known you a long time, Eric, so I say this from a place of love. Don't ever fuckin' talk to me like that again. Regina, Division's got a bug up its ass with these high-end homicides, and they're puttin' an even bigger bug up ours. I just want first licks when you catch the motherfucker. Two hospitals in the area have patients with GSWs. One had someone picked up a mile from here. Automobile accident, gunshot wounds discovered post-admit. - Bingo. Want a ride? - Abso-fucking-lutely. Thanks. Good evenin', Mr. John Doe. How you feelin' this evenin'? I'm good too, thanks for askin'. Let's go over your chart. Gunshot wound to the abdomen, in-and-out. Two cracked ribs, major concussion. Huh. It's a good thing you're unconscious so we can skip all the screamin' you would be doin' if you were... No, no. No! No! No! Fuck! - Fuck! - 2 You gave an excellent description of the suspect. Anything else? Any other details? No, it was dark. I didn't see much. Okay. Well, we're gonna get this guy. Don't you worry. I might have a couple detectives drop by your house in the next day or so. No. My wife's pregnant, that'll stress her out. We can't do that. Can't they come here or call me? Okay. Whatever works for you. When is she due? Three weeks. Whoa! Congratulations. Thanks. Do you have any advice? Uh, from the person who deliberately decided not to have kids? Probably not. Okay, so we're gonna transfer him to the prison hospital tomorrow. We'll be here to oversee that. What did he do? He killed a very good man. That's my cell phone. You think of anything at all, you give me a call. Anybody seen Detective Masterson? - That way. - Thank you. - Paul, get out of here. Go home. - No, I'm good. I'm just a little punchy. Listen, no offense, sweetheart, but you kinda got your ass handed to you tonight. Go home. Go see your wife. Shit. Hey, you. - Good morning. - Good morning. Mm! Oh, what happened? Some guy... broke into one of my patient's room and managed to mop the floor with me before I could stop him. - You got in a fight? - No... Baby, why would you do that? When some guy's hammerin' on you, T, you can't really tell him to stop, right? You are about to be a father. - I can't do this without you. - Okay. Okay. Okay. - I love you. - I love you. Mm. Now Daddy gotta pee. Come on, let me help you up. Mm. One, two, three! Here... - Don't move. - Mm. - Uh... Put some ice on that. - Yeah. Paul? Paul! Paul! No! Paul! Hm? - Paul! Oh! - Taryn, where are you? No! - Taryn? Baby, where are you? - Paul! This is your fault. You got involved. What do you want? For you to listen to me very carefully. If you hurt her... Oh! Oh, shit! Okay, okay! I'm sorry. - Please! - Don't fucking interrupt me again! - Okay. Okay. - Listen to me. - Go to the hospital, get my brother out. - Please. Talk to anyone, you talk to the police, she dies. - You fuck with me at all, she dies. - Please don't hurt her, sir. Please! Hello? Taryn? Hello?

Wait, are you the nurse who got jumped? Thought you were a chick. Yeah, I need to take him downstairs. - Imaging. - Imaging? Yeah, X-ray, MRI. Wherever he goes, I go. Whatever you say, officer. What's that? - That is his life support. - It wasn't on before. Well, if somethin' happens to him between here and imaging... it's my ass, not yours. So, would you mind gettin' the door? ...take him to urinalysis for backup... - How's the driving today? - Slow going... They're concerned about possible infection. They're gonna run an IV, probably for another two hours or so, and just see how... Dr. Smith! Dr. Smith. - It feels all right... - Okay. - Well, it'll get better. - Yeah, I could... All right, just get your balance. Either put your foot down or get up here and stretch that leg... Where are we goin'? I told you. Imaging. - It's lit for P3. - There's a different elevator for imaging. So, I read the jacket on the perp. You gonna tell me what's not inside? Abraham Guevara. Abe and his brother Mateo are street mercenaries for hire. Currently, that gruesome twosome are freelancing for Big D. Word out of county is Abe owes Big D for some big dope score, a traphouse he took down. And how does this scumbag figure into Josh's murder? Only Guevara's got those answers. What's happening? It's his heart. He's in V-fib. - Get the defibrillator. - What? The box underneath! Okay. Sorry, officer. - Where is he? - He should be here. This will get you going. Shit! Okay, calm down. Hey. Calm down, all right? It'll hurt like a motherfucker, but I'll get you out. - Take it easy. - Where's... Look, here we go. Come on, come on. You're in a hospital and I'm your nurse, all right? I'm gonna give you some Toradol and a little morphine for the pain, all right? The Toradol... All right. Here comes the good stuff, all right? Okay. - And here's the morphine. - Okay. There you go. Hey! Hey! Pull up security footage from the third floor, now. - Do you have officers on the exits? - Yes. - How many? - Six in total. Come on! We gotta see the footage. I'mma get you out of here, but I need you to walk for me. My stuff, where is it? - Where are my clothes? - Uh, your brother has 'em. - My brother? - Yeah. Right, all right! Calm down. Look, your brother has my wife! I need to get you to him to get my wife back. I want no other part of this shit, all right? All right. All right. Come on, let's go. Oh, stop! Right there. Right there, look. Who's that with the suspect? Paul Booker. Where is that elevator now? Uh, bottom floor, parking level three. - The emergency stop is engaged. - Got it. - Gimme the keys, I'm driving. - No, I'm driving. Give me the keys or your wife is dead. I'm driving. - Fair enough. - Watch the gun. Fuck. Oh, fuck. - Hey. Hey. - He good? Oh... Oh, shit! - What? - It's them. I'm on 'em! All right, hang tight. Masterson! Hey, this is my car, not a rental. - Hey, man, why don't you slow down, okay? - Shut up. Don't be a pussy. Hey, slow the fuck down! Get that fucking gun off me before it goes off. - Put it down! - Shit. Okay, okay. Hold on. - Oh, shit. It's a garage! - Shut up! Stop crying! - There's nobody behind us, slow down! - Stop crying! It's a really nice car. But you're drivin' it too hard. Just slow down. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, wait. Whoa! Shit. What the fuck? Swipe the other side. No, flip it, try the other side. It's not working. - "Janet." - Shit. They must've deactivated it. I was usin' hers to get you out. - Shit! - "They must've deactivated this shit." Police! Stop! Down! Down! - This is my car, man! You hit a cop! - Where are we going? - A cop! - I heard you the first time! Where? I don't know! He said to call when you were out. If he does anything to my wife or my baby... - Wait, what? - My wife's pregnant. Fuck. Get him on the phone! - Shit. Okay, okay, okay. - Get him on the phone! Yeah. - Hey, you good? - Shit! Yeah, I... I fucked up. - I tried to get you out of there. - No, man, no, man, it's okay. I'm out. I'm out, all right? I'm okay. You got the flash drive? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I got it. I got it on me. That's good. Good boy. You keep that thing close to you, understand? - Keep it safe. - Put my wife on speaker phone. - Shut up. - Put her on. - Shut the fuck up! - All right, all right! - Where the fuck are you? - I'm in the, uh... In the bus station. - West entrance. - Wait, listen. - The woman, she's okay, yeah? - She's fine. She's fine. She's... She's here with me. Make sure she's okay, understand? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What about Big D? - What about Big D? Did he contact you? - Yeah. We owe him. A lot. I know. I'll fuckin' handle it, straighten it out. Listen to me, put the woman on the phone for a second, okay? - Hello? - Here, man. Hello, baby. You okay? Paul, where are you? What is going on? - Are you okay? Did he hurt you? - I'm fine, um... I'm comin' for you, all right? - Hang up. - I love you. - Hang up! - I love you too, baby. Bye. Relax. It's okay. I swear to God, - if he does anything to my fucking wife... - Shut up! You do what I say when I fuckin' say, you'll be fine, all right? Oh, shit. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. - What? - Oh, my God. I'm having contractions. - Don't move. Don't move. - I need to lie down. All right. - Stop it! Stop it! - No! Let me fucking go! - Get the fuck off me! - Stop it! - Fucking... - Stop! Stop! I don't wanna hurt either of you. So don't make me. Please don't make me. - Hey! - The whole time last night. - Yeah! I was tryin' to tell you! - Yeah? You got it, man. Don't hang around here no more. Take five! You got another shirt? No, just the jacket. Put it on. Why? - Where are you goin' with my shoes? - Just stay in the fuckin' car. Man, I think you could rehab. - What? - Yeah! Why you gonna do somethin' like that? Stay in the fucking car, please. Fuckin' manners, you dick. Yo, that'll be $70. Forget about that! Why would Booker help a scumbag like Guevara? The dope score he's sittin' on? That's half a million reasons why. Nah, he's got a pregnant wife, got a steady job. He's not the type to throw it all away for a cash grab. Hey. Why aren't you telling me how the Guevaras are connected to the DA's office? Abe's brother, Mateo... was staring down a ten-year stretch at the state pen. So Abe offered Josh Gregory a deal. A flash drive loaded with evidence in exchange for his brother's freedom. What kind of evidence? The kind that will take down a lot of dirty cops. Uniform, detectives' division, brass. All of 'em. Homicide? Me? We had to dive into every division. Joshua vouched for you and I vouched for you, given our... history. Our history. Oh, you mean us fucking on and off for five years? You mean us living together? You're an ass. I just wanna thank you so much for vouching for me, for all your support with the fucking DA! Look. You're clean. That's all I care about. What the fuck is this dude doin'? - Get out. - Why? 'Cause they gave me a piece of shit car. That's why. Go home, Paul. What? No! No, man, no... Can't give away my... - Go home now. - No. You don't wanna get involved in this shit, Paul. Let me handle it. Not without my wife. Shit. - I'm going with you. - First time you ever pull a trigger? - Yeah, so? - Yeah? You're shakin'. You should be worried about that. Well, go ahead and shoot me. Shoot yourself. But remember to shoot the Toradol before the morphine. Too much Toradol, kidney failure. Too much morphine, you slip into a coma. But I'm sure you can figure that out, smart guy. Pick up your shit and let's go... nurse. Last call, the 11:05 for Syracuse is now boarding. All passengers are required to... - Mateo. - Yo. I'm walkin' in now. Matty, listen to me. We're comin' in from the Fourth Street side. Mateo? You there? You see me? - No. - You got two cops to your six. Okay? So keep comin' to me. Keep comin'... - You're breakin' up. - On... - Where are you? - I'm right here. I'm... - What? - You hear me? I can't hear you. - Keep... straight... toward... - What? Stop, stop, stop. Stop, stop. Go back, go back. Turn around. Turn around. It's a trap. They made us. - Can you hear me? - What? They're here. Go back to the warehouse. ...here... meet me... do what I... now... Mateo? Mateo! Oh, fuck it. Taryn! Abe! Go! Run! Keep moving, keep moving. Go! Go! Hey! Hey! Come back! Hey! - Hey, hey! Stop running, stop running. - No, no, no! We need to get you out of here. It's not safe. Watch your back! - Go, go! - Wait! No! Go. Black Mercedes. Put the seat back! I need to see. Oh, shit. Shit. Oh, fuck. Oh! Get down! - Oh, God! - You okay? Yeah. Yeah. - What the fuck was that, man? - Shut up. Let me think. - What's goin' on? - Get in here. Check this door. Check this door. - Fuck. - We need a key. Camera, camera, camera. - Don't look up! - Oh, shit. - Uh... - Come on. I need a shot. - Get it ready. - No. - No? - No. No, this stops here. - I'm not givin' you anything. - Give me a shot, - or you'll get your own fucking shot. - What the... If you don't keep me goin', your wife is dead. I saw on the news about you and your brother killin' the assistant DA. - Oh, Jesus. - You gotta turn yourself in. Do you just constantly say stupid shit? You know, I... I bet you your wife kidnapped herself. Come on. You're goin' to jail. Everybody knows your face. You and your stupid brother. - Oh, is that right? - Yeah. If I'm goin' to jail, you're comin' with me, pal. My brother's in the breeze. Hit me. Thank you.

We haven't thought of one for him yet. Him? Yeah. Move. Go. You know, my old man used to beat the shit out of my mother. Used to do it to her, used to do it to me. When my brother was born, it got worse. One night, she got tired of gettin' the shit kicked out of her, so she shot him in the head when he was sleepin'. She died in prison. I raised my brother from that point on. Where are you goin'? I'm going to kill 'em. All of 'em. And what about my wife? Pick up a weapon, man. And do what? Go gunnin' for cops? They're dirty cops. Which will matter a few months from now in a courtroom, - long after we're shot dead. - What other fuckin' choice you got? They got your wife. Your baby. Everybody says they'd do anything for their fuckin' family. Well, this is as fucking "anything" as it gets right now, pal. Pick up the gun. Kushie. What? The piñata, the stupid piñata at Cheetah's place. - Oh, the fuckin' camera. - Yeah. Lewis would've took that shit into evidence. Yeah, so how the hell do we get it back? Can I get you something? Water? Juice? What is this, a fucking flight? I need a doctor, bitch. No, I can't help you with that. You know, I... I met your husband. I can see why you married him. Did you kill him?

We're both just responding to external pressures. I'm beholden to certain people and how they want things done. - You saw his brother? Mateo? - Yeah. Well, they want me to do the same thing to your wife. They want me to put a bullet through her head. I don't have to run down my reasons why, or rationalize why I do the things I do. You see the things I've seen, and tell me how much you think the thin blue line that exists between you and chaos really costs, and how much we should all pay for it. You tried to kill me and you kidnapped my wife today. Maybe I should check in with you tomorrow. Your wife doesn't have till tomorrow. Corner of Forest and Central. You've got an hour. - So that's the plan? - You got a better idea? - I got some notes. - You sure my wife is there? My guy on the inside says she's in Narco.
