(GASPS) (SCREAMING) (SIREN BLARING) (MIMICKING REVVING ENGINE) * Doctor, doctor I need a doctor * Doctor, doctor There you go, that's for you and you. See you later. Oh, Michelle. -Oh! Hey, listen, did you talk to Naomi for me? -No. (SIREN BLARING) You can go. I ask you to do one thing and you can't do that. (SPEAKING GIBBERISH) (VOCALIZING) * Naomi! What are you doing? Naomi, if, what if, I asked did you have any plans for this weekend? What would you say? I have and they don't include you. Why don't you save some of that energy and find yourself a girl who at least thinks you're attractive? Oh! That was good. You see, with your wit, my brains, my brother's car, baby, we can go places. -You like Italian? -Italian what? Politics, football, underarm deodorant? No, food. I hate it. You see, I hate it too. We got something in common already. Let me get this straight. You don't think I'm interesting. You don't think I'm sexy, you think my sense of humor sucks. And you wouldn't go out with me if I was the last man in this hospital named Jackson. That's right. You see, I think all those things too. We were made for each other. Jackson? -Yeah? -Get your ass of my desk. This floor is off-limits. Okay, that's far enough. (GROANING) (GROANING) What the hell was that? Be right back. Hey, don't go nowhere, all right? (PEOPLE SCREAMING) You've got two minutes to clear this area. (GRUNTING) You now have less than two minutes. -Get down! -Get down! -Go on, move it, move it, move it! -Let's go, let's go! What the hell is... (SIREN BLARING) ZANUCHI: Okay, let's go, everybody. Let's move out! Oh, shit. Somebody is having a serious party. Let's go, come on. Get out! Let's go, come on. Smart people run the other way when they hear gunfire. Which means you must be incredibly stupid. Or the hero type. Which is it? I guess I'm very stupid. Hi there, Mr. Trevelian. Trevanian. This is Agent Blackwood, Agent Whiteside. Blackwood? Whiteside? (LAUGHING) That's cool. Are you alone down here? That's right, the computers and I have an understanding. They do all the work and I let them. (CHUCKLING) This way. They told me I'd go crazy down here. But I didn't believe 'em. I like silence. Know what I mean? No, I don't. Yeah. Ta-da! (CHUCKLING) Not bad, eh? BLACKWOOD: This place gives me the willies. WHITESIDE: What happened to the heat ventilator? It's hell to clean though, man. This way. And there you go, gentlemen. Prisoner number 569. Patrick Dickson, architect. Crime, murder. Sentence. (VOCALIZING) Life. Life? In this? Man, why don't they just take the guy out back and shoot him? Because that's too easy. It's no return value, right? Right. But a lifetime spent in one of these babies... Your body frozen. Your mind still active. Forever wandering, never able to rest. Hell, if I wasn't so mellow, it would scare the shit out of me, man. I can just imagine. Now, this guy, he just got lucky. Get him up. (WHIRRING) (WHIRRING RESUMES) Anybody got a beer? -Nice threads. -They're all right. -How long have I been in? -Just 24 months. Felt like 24 years. Hey, I pulled guys out after 20 stretches, and they've gone totally batshit, man. You got off light. Hey, who pulled me out? Beats the hell out of me, man. Good luck, Dickson. Dickson? Hey, my name isn't... TREVANIAN: Mr. Dickson? Trevanian, FBI. These are Agents Blackwood and Whiteside. -Have we met before? -DICKSON: Er... No. Why did you guys pull me up? Look, we don't have time to explain. We'll talk on the way down. BLACKWOOD: Let's go. DICKSON: Hey, guys. Look, I'm not going anywhere till I know what's happening here. Mr. Dickson, listen, we need your help. -Oh, my help? -Yeah. -People's lives depend on it. -Is that right? That's right. Whoa! I'm not leaving this pleasure palace until I know what's in it for me. Okay? Look, Dickson, don't be an asshole. You got a chance here. You can go along with us. We'll forget about the rest of your sentence. You'll be a free man. Or you can piss me off, I'll stick you back in that tank, you can keep pushing your beard up through your chin. Full pardon? That's the idea. When do we leave? (SIREN BLARING) You really know how to show a girl a good time, don't you? You should've come with me when you had the chance, man. We could've been chilling out with some linguini and white wine. Now look at us. Hey, maybe these guys will let us phone out for a pizza. Yeah. Just say the word, baby, and I will kick his fat ass. Go for it, Jackson. Quiet. (WHISPERING) Maybe later. (SIGHING) My hero. (BEEPING) For crying out loud, will somebody get a picture on these things here? We only got about three minutes. Come on. Three minutes to what? Hey, how about a little hint here? Sir? President's on the line. Trevanian. No, sir. We haven't heard anything specific yet. We're due to hear from them again in about two minutes. Yes, sir. Right. Yes, sir. Yes, the architect's here, sir. Right. President was asking for me? Well, this is your baby, Dickson. You built the goddamn thing. Now take a look at this. Look familiar to you? Now, we don't draw plans as good as you, but best we could do on such short notice. It's... It's terrific. It's a...good effort. I mean, you got the scale and everything. TREVANIAN: Now, the terrorists have taken over the top half of the building. Here. From what we can figure out, holding at least about nine hostages. Nine hostages. Why is the President so interested? Well, one of the hostages is special. She's his daughter. SARAH: Oh, you seem to think I haven't got this worked out yet. I'm your star hostage. Right? So there's no way you're gonna shoot me. Want some free advice? I think you should get therapy. Let me explain something to you, okay? Because I don't know what planet you people have been living on. But obviously, you don't know how things work around here. You're never gonna pull this off. The minute you walked into this room, you gave up living. But you see... I've never lived. (TYPING) (BEEPING) We're ready. (BEEPING) Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. ROMULUS: Who am I talking to? Trevanian, FBI. It's 10:15. In four hours, if I don't have what I want, it's gonna start raining hostages. And I will save the best for last. Jesus Christ. Say hello to your father, Sarah. I'm sure they have a hook up to the White House. Say hello to your father, Sarah. Don't give them anything. So predictable. Just tell us what it is you want. $50,000,000. Where the hell do you think we're gonna get that kinda money from? You figure it out. Hey, my man. This guy needs some serious attention. If he doesn't get treatment, he's going to die. We all die. Sooner or later. Bastard. (CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) Whoa, whoa! Hey, you ain't gotta do that, man... You ain't gotta do this. (MIMICS FIRING) -TREVANIAN: All the stairwells are booby-trapped. -Uh-huh. Now, they've shut down the elevators here, here and here. Except this one here. They've left it just below the roof. Now, that's our way in. No shit! The assault team go through the elevator, into the ventilation system. Then the second team goes in. First team, disable the booby traps, the second team, take out the terrorists. Yeah, right. The only problem is, they may have booby-trapped the air ducts too. So when you get up there, you'll be looking for anything that doesn't belong. When I get up there? Yeah, they won't be expecting that we're moving this quickly. Okay, look. Let me... Let me help you out a second here, okay? I don't wanna rain on your parade, but why don't you just include me out? Listen here, Dickson. You belong to me now. You jump when I say jump. Or I'm gonna make sure you disappear off the face of this planet. Look, I'm just an architect, all right? Yeah, right. And nobody's asking you here to do gung ho. Good. Because I don't do gung ho. (LOUD WHIRRING) TREVANIAN: Now once you get in there, all you have to do is... DICKSON: ...look if I see something suspicious. TREVANIAN: That's right. And if you see anything suspicious... DICKSON: Hey, that looks suspicious. Go silent running. (CHOPPER WHIRRING SOFTLY) This is Bird Dog. We're in position. Roger, Bird Dog. TEAM 1: (SOFTLY) Move, move, move, move. Get down, get down. Dickson! Dickson, get your ass over here. Get down. -Get down! -Planting charge. TEAM 2: Charge ready. Everybody, head down. TEAM 1: We're at the top of the elevator shaft. Going down. Go, go, go, go. TEAM 2: (WHISPERING) Move out, move out. That's it. That's it. TEAM 1: Come on, Dickson. Hurry up. -DICKSON: All right. -TEAM 1: Come on. TEAM 2: All right, we're clear. (WHISPERING) Come on, step on it. Let's go. Move it. Come on, Dickson, move your butt. Control panel has been disabled. We're gonna try to bypass. Bypass complete. Gonna hook the remote. Wait! (TEAM SCREAMING) Oh, God! Get the medics down there. Move it! (SIRENS BLARING) All right! (SIGHING) Of course. Nobody leaves the party. TREVANIAN: There's got to be a file on this guy. People just don't appear from out of nowhere. BLACKWOOD: No record of him. Well, keep looking, goddamnit! BLACKWOOD: Wait a minute. Something. Subject Romulus. File status, classified. Restricted. Access, Shadowchaser personnel only. Romulus Shadowchaser. -What the hell is this? -BLACKWOOD: I don't know. -(BEEP) -WHITESIDE: Sir? This guy's skin temperature is practically non-existent. There's no blood flow, no warm areas. No evidence of human life whatever. And his voice is hitting sub-sonic ranges, way beyond the capacity of human vocal chords. BLACKWOOD: I've got something. Project Shadowchaser. Project leader, Joseph J. Kinderman. Jesus Christ. Kinderman. BLACKWOOD: You know this guy? Oh, yeah. He's the head of ATR. BLACKWOOD: ATR, that's... WHITESIDE: Military research guys. Get him on the phone. If Kinderman's involved in this, the shit hasn't even begun to hit the fan. Jesus Christ. Kinderman, you son of a bitch. Ha! Romulus, you son of a bitch. I don't know who or what the hell you are. But you just murdered five of my people. ROMULUS: You've got three hours left. I suggest you don't waste them. TREVANIAN: Three hours just isn't enough time, though. We're dealing with a massive political and bureaucratic problem here. Well, I've decided to make it easier for you. As you can see, we have a very sick man here. So I've decided to send him down. You're a very, very lucky man. (SCREAMING) I'd say that clarifies the situation. Very clear. Trevanian, life is simple. You live... Or you die. -(BEEP) -I don't believe it. Trevanian. Trevanian, can you hear me? TREVANIAN: Dickson, what the hell? We thought you were dead. Didn't anybody count the bodies? Shit! Listen. Listen here, Dickson. Dasilva. My name is Dasilva. You got the wrong guy. -That's impossible. -Check it out. My name is Michael Dasilva. (LOUDLY) I'm not your goddamn archi... (WHISPERING) I'm not your goddamn architect. Get a hold of that spaced out dipshit at the prison. I want to know what he's given us here. -You listen here... -Dasilva. I don't give a shit what your name is! -What the hell are you trying to pull here? -(INAUDIBLE) Come on, Trevanian. I mean, I'm in the deep freeze for years, okay? You wake me up, you offer me a pardon. What was I supposed to say? "Sorry, mister, you got the wrong guy." Well, he does have a point. -Just get me the hell out of here, okay? -TREVANIAN: How? "How?" How the hell am I supposed to know? You got me in this mess. Now listen to me carefully, Dickson. There's no way that we can come and get you out at this time. I suggest that you hide out somewhere until this is over. You understand? That's your best suggestion? Boy, you guys really got it together. I'm telling you, Dasilva, stay out of the way. If the terrorists find you, they'll think you're one of us. You'll be endangering the rest of the... Dasilva! Dasilva! He's gone. Check this out. TREVANIAN: Yes, that's right. I'll back you up. TREVANIAN: No, that's right. No. No, Margaret. -BLACKWOOD: Ahem! -I don't know when I'm coming home. Except... Yes. Look, I'll call you if I can. Right. Is this gonna make me more unhappy than I already am? BOTH: Yeah, pretty much. "Michael Dasilva, ex-pro football..." I knew I'd seen this son of a bitch before. Yeah, he killed himself a redneck in a bar and claimed self-defense. And I guess they didn't buy it. TREVANIAN: A football player. I put a goddamn football player up there. (SNIFFING) Oh! Terrific. I could have picked the ladies' room. Shh! (CLICKING TONGUE) Oh, I'm filthy. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) All right, come on out. (ZANUCHI GROANING) Don't touch the trigger! It's a hair-trigger. Don't... Don't worry. I know how to handle a gun. Goddamn it, lady! You could have killed me. SARAH: Scared you, didn't I? ZANUCHI: Come on, let's go. Yeah, you scared me. You think he cares about you? He doesn't care about any of you. You're all expendable. Yeah. Yeah, it's me. Let me talk to him. I don't care if he is busy, interrupt him. Damn it! KING: Stand up. Up, bitch. -Hey, where are you taking her? -It's all right. (NERVOUSLY) Hey, come on, man, you can't be doing this kinda shit... I'll blow your head off. (PANTING) (GRUNTS) -Bitch! -(SCREAMS) -(GROANS) -DASILVA: Hey! (GRUNTING) Zanuchi! Zanuchi! (GRUNTING) I was only kidding. Ahhh! (GUNSHOTS) Oh! We got a survivor. -Deal with it. -We'll head him off. (GUN CLICKS) DASILVA: (GROANING) Oh, come on. (GASPING) I must've been a real shit in another life to deserve this. (CHUCKLING) We got him. He is in the elevator shaft. Ventilation system. (LAUGHING) (GUNFIRE) (GROANING) (GRUNTING) (BOTH GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) (BEEP) Shit! We've lost him. Goddamn you. He's not one of my men. Now look, you've got my word on that, okay? -Tell them your name. -Romulus, let her go. -Tell them your name. -(SHAKILY) Laura Jamieson. -How long have you worked here? -11 months. Romulus, he's not one of my men. -Trevanian, you're repeating yourself. -(LAURA SOBBING) If I tell you he's one of my men, you're gonna go ahead and do this anyway. So for God's sake, what difference does it make? Let her go. You know, I have to do this. DASILVA: Hey, asshole, can you hear me? I'm not a Fed. Okay, then who are you? Just the wrong guy in the wrong place. You don't have to kill the girl. Look, it's me who you want. Why don't you come and get me? (LAURA SOBBING) Look, what's the matter? You scared of me? I'm up here, laughing at you, man. (LAURA SOBBING) Goddamn you, listen... (GUNSHOT) Trevanian, you've got two hours left. TREVANIAN: Hey, Dasilva, can you hear me? Goddamn it, Dasilva. Are you listening to me? Go fuck yourself, Trevanian. TREVANIAN: I told you to stay out of the way. Now, because of you, we've got another dead hostage on our hands. Listen, you son of a bitch. You think I'm enjoying this? Look, I don't know what's gotten into your head, pal. But you sure as hell ain't helping my job any. You're outclassed, Trevanian. Don't you understand that? Why, you asshole! What do you think this is? The first and ten at the Super Bowl? Hey... Maybe you need a manual to tell you when you're getting your ass kicked. But I don't. Forget about your pardon, Dasilva. Not only am I gonna stick you back in the freezer, but I'm gonna make sure you stay there for the rest of your goddamn life. Do you hear me? Same old Trevanian. Kinderman. I see your ulcer is playing up again. I want all excess personnel removed from the lobby. "Excess personnel"? What the hell are you talking about? This is no longer a hostage situation. This is now a national security matter. National security, my ass. You think I'm gonna hand this over to you and your stormtroopers here? My Pentagon clearance gives me authority over you at all times. Isn't that correct, Mr. Trevanian? Isn't that correct? Yeah, that's correct. Then remove your men. These two, they stay. (LAUGHING MOCKINGLY) Whatever you say, Trevanian. Whatever you say. -Insurance. -(COCKING GUN) Is anybody down there? KINDERMAN: Can you hear me? Who the hell are you? I'm Joseph Kinderman. I'm with ATR. That's Advanced Technical Research. What's the matter? You lose one of your lab rabbits? I understand that you've been giving Mr. Trevanian problems. That won't happen anymore. I'm in charge here now. Ah, that's great, Doc. You've really put my mind to rest now. KINDERMAN: I run a department called Shadowchaser. Sometimes known as the Romulus Project. Is there any relation to the fruitcake running around up here? (CHUCKLING) Yes. Your perspicacity amazes me. Now the aim of the project was to create a perfect synthetic warrior. Intelligent, adaptable, self-sufficient. Unhindered by any sense of morality. And Romulus is that creation. DASILVA: An android. You gotta be kidding. This psycho's an android? Android, yes. Psycho, no. His mind is not disturbed. Merely free of the usual social and emotional inhibitions. Well, that's terrific, Doc. Because this guy's stairs definitely do not reach the attic. Romulus is a billion-dollar killing machine, Mr. Dasilva. You have no chance against him. I'd advise you to keep out of his way... ...and mine, until this situation is resolved. (GROANS) (GRUNTING) (BOTH GRUNTING) Don't be stupid! Come on! Shoot me. Shoot me! Do I look like a goddamned terrorist? Yes. Well, I'm not. Well, what are you? You a cop? Not exactly. FBI? CIA? -Special Forces good guy? -(GROANS SOFTLY) They've been fiddling with that computer for the last 20 minutes. They're working on a newfangled hot idea to beat the android. (SCOFFING) BLACKWOOD: Yeah, well, maybe they're gonna challenge him to a game of chess. Yeah, maybe. (WHISPERING) Come on. We're leaving. Oh... Wait a minute. I have to change. We don't have any time for that! Oh, no, I'm not going out there looking like this. I'd look ridiculous. DASILVA: You'd look a lot worse in the morgue, lady. Close the door. Please close the door. ZANUCHI: Any luck? FRANCO: No, I haven't seen him. ZANUCHI: Well, let's look this way. SARAH: Ready. What is that? I got food poisoning at the French Embassy. This is all I have to wear. -Shoes. -Shoes. Lose the shoes. Who the hell do you think your pushing? What are you doing? How do you expect me... -Listen, lady! -What? Out there you may be the President's daughter, but in here, you're just excess baggage. Oh, you think I'm gonna tie you down. Tennis, swimming, track, archery, fencing, gymnastics, horseback riding and riflery. Now do you think you can keep up with that? Look, lady, I've had a very shitty day. And if you give me anymore trouble, I am gonna leave you here. Got it? Yeah. Got it. One thing... Keep your paws to yourself. No, thank you. I don't think that I'll wear them, as you so politely suggested. Smart girl. TREVANIAN: Dasilva. Tell him I'm rescuing you. He says he's rescuing me. That crazy, gung ho bastard's got the girl! Look, Dasilva, there's no place that you can go. Dasilva! -Romulus, this is Kinderman. -What the hell are you doing? -Dasilva is with the girl. -Are you crazy? He's not acting on my orders, he's working on his own. He has no... (GRUNTING) Shit! Go! Hey, asshole. You're supposed to pull the pin out. (DASILVA COUGHING) Jonah, level 38. Now. You pull a stunt like that again, I won't care what kinda clearance you've got, I'll bust your ass! Look, I have one chance, just one chance of retrieving Romulus. And I'm not gonna let you or Dasilva stand in my way. Retrieve Romulus? You're slime. You don't care about the hostages. You just want your goddamn robot back, huh? Yeah. That is correct. Just tell me, how are you gonna do that? That information comes on a need to know basis. You do not need to know. -(SHRIEKS) -It's only me. -What? -I can't climb in this. Oh! (SHRIEKS) Please! You have no respect. -Push me up. -DASILVA: Come on, get up! All right, all right, all right. Okay. SARAH: (WHISPERS) Respect... -DASILVA: What are you mumbling? -Respect. It's gone. Look, don't let it go to your head, okay? That 50,000,000? There's only one guy who thinks you're worth that. And he runs on batteries. My white knight. (PANTING) What are you doing? Catching up on some sleep. I've only had a couple of years. No! No, no, no, no, no. This is not naptime. Why don't we keep moving? -Where to? -Oh, out of the building, away from here. All the exits are blocked. You mean this is it? The light at the end of the tunnel. Look, you wanna go out there and get yourself killed, terrific. Me, I got a couple more things I wanna do with my life. (GASPING) Number four! Football! You were in the Saints play-off game. That Saints play-off game! -Right? Am I right? -You were there? You bet I was there. Right! You were the third strength quarterback who ran over 100 yards in the fourth quarter. -That was so incredible. -(CHUCKLING) Yes, that was a great run. My God, I've never seen that done before. And you know, I think they should've really started you in that game. I mean, I knew that you had an arm. I had no idea you had a pair of legs like that. What wheels, you were smoking! Man, I knew the first quarterback... But you really should've passed to Andrews when you had the chance. What are you talking about? Andrews was covered by Rudge! Yeah, yeah. Stoker, no, he was on the 40, Hirsthill took him down. Mmm-mmm. -Are you kidding me? -You had time to make that pass. Give me a break! Valentine and Cobley, they were up my ass. What was I supposed to do? Stand still? Davies, he was smoking up your ass. Now if he'd made the touchdown, you'd have been dead meat. No way! I was miles ahead of him. He never would've caught me. That's only 'cause Hal took him down before you made the TD. Well, that's what you call team-work, babe. -Yeah. And your timing was incredible. -(CHUCKLING) You really, really did it. God, what the hell happened to you? (SIGHING) Special Forces good guy. So, you're just gonna sit around here on your ass, huh? Tell you what. I'll flap my arms and I'll fly us out of here. Okay? There are only two ways out. The stairs and the elevators. And they are all booby-trapped. Booby-trapped. They're all booby-trapped. Of course! -What? -They'd have to. They'd have to what? Come on. Come on. Fox, this is Chicken Hawk. Fox, this is Chicken Hawk. Do you read? This is Fox. What's your status, Chicken Hawk? Sir, Blackwood. What do ya got? We're picking up a high frequency radio transmission. Put it on the speaker. ROMULUS: On schedule. Wait for my signal, 15 minutes before pickup. Roger, Fox. Chicken Hawk out. Chicken Hawk. -That's an old helicopter designation. -Yeah, yeah. Well, it makes sense. A helicopter's the only way they could get out of here. Harris, keep us posted. Come on. -Well? -No, no. Nothing more. Right, if Romulus is gonna give his pilot an all-clear 15 minutes before he's due to pick him up, that chopper's got to be parked within this radius. There are only a couple of possibilities. The dump site and the old factory on the east side. The rest is residential. All right, check it out. We got exactly one hour to pull something out of the hat. You think if we pull this one off, there's a nice, big, fat bonus? If we pull this off, we'll be lucky to keep what's left of our nuts. I hear you. Come on, let's get out of here! Trevanian, where are those men going? That information comes on a need to know basis and you don't need to know. Excuse me, I don't mean to ask a trivial question but... Shh! I think I just found a way out of here. Oh, you've made a decision. That's because I'm concerned about your future. Mr. President, I believe we have one chance of overcoming Romulus. But it will have to be done face to face. And the only possible opportunity is during the exchange for the money for the hostages. Yes, Mr. President, I'm quite aware of that. But this will work. I can absolutely guarantee it. Thank you, Mr. President. You won't regret this decision. The money's on its way. Pardon me. Can you tell me where the men's room is, please? Oh, so sorry, I thought you were a man. Come on, lady, let's not go through this again. Give me the gun. Come and get it! -(CRIES OUT IN SHOCK) -Yes! Bye-bye! Back! Up! Up! Oh! Hold back! Off! Oh! Trevanian, I'm sending the girl down now. Yeah! You bring her down, I'll buy you the biggest goddamn beer you ever saw. See ya. You're crazy. Certifiable. (COCKS GUN) Good. Let's go. Hey, Dasilva, what're you waiting for? No more heroics. You want your pardon, you get the hell outta there now! You get outta there now! Romulus, this is Kinderman. Kinderman. It isn't every day you get the chance to talk to your creator. Should I be honored? Romulus, you can't win. Oh, can't I? KINDERMAN: I know your limitations. You can be brought down. Blind optimism. It is such an endearing quality. Why are you doing this? You have no interest in money. ROMULUS: I've learned that money is freedom. What was my future with you? A toy soldier? Obedient... Expendable. There's a lot of me in you, Romulus. I don't wish to see you destroyed. Oh, am I touched. Or... Are you concerned with your billion dollar investment? Then I'll have to bring you down, Romulus. Then who better to do it than my creator? Or I will have to destroy you. But what if... The creation destroys the creator? Now that would be true freedom. (PLAYING TUNE ON MOUTH ORGAN) Okay, come on folks, there's a better party downstairs. Let's go! Do you think you can handle this? No, but I'll figure it out. -All right, let's get outta here. -Come on. Come on, everybody. Come on. Listen, I never got a chance to thank you. -Maybe we can talk about it downstairs. -Let's get outta here. I can see why they had to freeze you. Come on. Come on. SARAH: Come on. (BEEP) -Come on. -Come on. Come on, let's go, let's go. Come on! Move it, move it, move it! Come on, let's go! Oh, shit! SARAH: Come on! Go! Go! Now! Ahhh! (SARAH GASPS) Let's go. -Ow! -DASILVA: Watch it! SARAH: Quit whining, will you? (WHISPERING) Wait, wait, wait. Okay, come on. (MECHANICAL WHIRRING) (BREATHING HARD) Going somewhere? (WHIRRING) (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) (BEEPS) (BOTH BREATHING HARD) Listen. Why isn't he following us? (SIREN BLARING) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) Go. Go. (CRIES OUT) Hold on! (SARAH GRUNTING) -(SARAH SCREAMING) -Hold on! -Sarah! -Ahhh! -DASILVA: Hold on! -I am! Sarah! Romulus. Time's up. And I hope for the girl's sake that you have the money. -KINDERMAN: It's here. -I've sent down the elevator. I'd like the President to bring it up himself. Are you absolutely crazy? That's not the deal, Romulus. That was never the deal. Mr. President, I'm sure you're watching this. It isn't a difficult choice. Either you bring me the money... Or you watch your daughter die. (SIREN BLARING) KINDERMAN: Now, this dart contains a compound of acid and ZSV. It's a micro-explosive. I know what the hell it is. Once injected into the bio-stream, the ZSV travels instantly to the cortex, where it detonates. A tiny explosion. (CHUCKLING) But a fatal one for Romulus. A sort of android embolism. (SIREN WAILING) -Dr. Kinderman. -Mr. President. Sir. I believe you've been working on a surprise for Romulus. Yes, sir, it's ready, sir. Mr. President, there's no guarantee that this half-assed thing is even gonna work. Speaking in ignorance again, Mr. Trevanian. Gentlemen, at this late stage, I do not believe it serves any purpose in quibbling amongst ourselves. Is this your marksman? Yes, sir. The very best, sir. I hope so. As I have discussed with Agent Trevanian, Romulus will not be expecting me so we can use the element of surprise. It will all be over in a few seconds. TREVANIAN: Good luck, Mr. President. This may be the last chance I have to talk to you, Romulus. You said that if the creation destroys the creator, that would be true freedom. Do you remember? Do you remember? I remember. Well, now's your opportunity. Are you going to take it? -(GUNSHOT) -Oh! Why? You're a popular man, Mr. President. Your policies of international appeasement have earned you acclaim the world over. And while you have been busy touting for votes, our enemies have been laughing at us. Laughing at the new America, the soft America. Many of us do not share your vision, Mr. President. So that when you step down from office, you'll make way for a stronger government. One that wants to see this country great again. Step down from office? You're insane. I have no intention of stepping down! Wrong. (SARAH SHRIEKS) No! Ahhh! Kill the girl. DASILVA: Trevanian. Looks like you've been shafted good and hard, pal. Looks like we both have. Fox to Chicken Hawk. Come on in. Go ahead, Fox. You've got the green light, Chicken Hawk. Come and get us. Roger, Fox. I'm on my way. (SIREN BLARING) -Hold it right there! FBI! -Don't move. BOTH: Jesus! Trevanian, the booby traps have been reset. And they're counting down. In 15 minutes, this whole place is gonna blow. Yeah, Dasilva, I know, I know. Pretty good scam you just pulled, Kinderman. You don't know when you're finished, do you, Dasilva? Sorry, but I gotta settle something with this freak of yours. Come on, asshole, you can do better than that. Leave him. He's insignificant now. Whatever you say. DASILVA: Hey, sweetness, my grandmother can shoot better than that. And she's dead. (COCKING GUN) What's the matter, piss eyes? You need a fresh jumpstart? (GUN CLICKING) Okay, you're not in the shape you used to be, but this is one touchdown you can't afford to miss. (GRUNTS) Hut! Big mistake. You've been a constant source of amusement. Well, try laughing this off, shithead. (CRIES OUT IN SHOCK) (MECHANICAL WHIRRING) (BOTH GRUNTING) Ahhh! (WHIRRING) (BEEPING) (HELICOPTER APPROACHING) (BEEPING CONTINUES) (GRUNTING) They'll hunt you down. You'll never get away with it. My dear child, I have got away with it. (SCREAMING) (GUNS COCKING) It's over. Let her go. (PANTING) Sarah! (SNARLING) No! WHITESIDE: Come on! I got ya! I got ya! Dasilva, hang on! Come on! Hold on, hold on! SARAH: Hold on! WHITESIDE: Hang on! Pull him up! Pull him up! Hang on! (GRUNTING) Come on! Pull him up! Pull him up! Come on, man. Just a little bit more. Come on! No! Ahhh! (INAUDIBLE) WHITESIDE: Just a little bit more, pull! Be strong, be strong! Come on, now. Pull up! For Christ's sakes, pull up! (SIREN WAILING) Touchdown! Sarah! Sarah! Sarah. Sarah, are you all right? Sarah, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Oh, Sarah. Come on home. I thought you said he was dead. Kinderman? He never had a monopoly on android research. You son of a bitch. (INAUDIBLE) JACKSON: Yo, Dasilva! (CHUCKLING) MAN: Hell, if I wasn't so mellow, it would scare the shit out of me, man.
