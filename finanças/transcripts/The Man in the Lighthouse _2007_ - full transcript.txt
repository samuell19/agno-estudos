Some people say that the fairy lighthouse discovers the man she believes attractive to have sex. I've been to the lighthouse for three years, but still, the fairy has not noticed me. Maybe I'm not the kind of man that the fairy like. I really do not believe in fairies. They are just stories created by old from here, Wolf. Mang Tisho is probably the only who believes in fairies. He always talks about his experience with the fairy. So far, not been forgotten the story of his youth. Matthew, how are you? Not seen you for a long time. I went on vacation. You went to Bicol? No, Manila. Are you related to the person buried here? They are not my relatives. But they are very important to me. Sometimes in our lives, some people are more important than our own family. Sometimes they can even be more important than your own life. Are you related to Ligaya Lorica? Ligaya is the woman who has loved most. Plus, Matthew. More Plus, Matthew. More Faster! Do not stop!

The view is fresh, and so are our beautiful faces. I glanced to those beautiful housewives. Tish, I still rice cakes. Why not purchase them all? Hare mucho que no te lavas, one notices the smell from a distance. "How is this to be a place resort when people smells terrible and are not able to shower!? That's rude. It was just a joke. Just a joke. The truth is that it is a sentence of man. It's bigger and alone. It survives by coal. It was just a joke. I am sure that you is a rich man. Perida, stop flirting with him. Could never to return to Wolf. I'm not flirting. I'm being kind and affectionate. Arman make sure it holds. Oh my wearing the shoes full of mud! It's Nike! Can not you be more careful?

Oh, Arman Please excuse, I have to handle everything. Okay lady. Thanks for coming. Let's continue. Bye. The materials are sufficient? Are you sure? Are you okay? Somewhat concerned, my father can come in any time. I wonder what. He is as handsome as you. Ronel must be lucky. I'm sure has a lot gift from his father. Do not be melodramatic. We're buying new clothes which is my payday! But they are not imported. No thanks. Thank you. Rice Cakes! Shall we? Mateo! Tishol Lord! Good morning! Good morning! Will the cemetery again?

There in Punta Malabrigo. Who are you? Nobody. I am alone. It's a shame you're having holiday alone. Well wait Would you look old? No, sir. You look young. So please, stop refer to me as sir. This place seems very quiet. During Holy Week place was crowded. Visitors come here to Manila. The water is much clearer compared to Nasugbu. It is very unfortunate that no 're with my friends. It would have been fun. Do you drink? Yes, sometimes. Can you meet me later? And we drink? "Matthew? Sorry. Thank you. I bought something to eat. You can prepare it, please. I continue with my chores, Matthew. By the way, if you know of house for sale here, please let me know. Of course. We're going to eat. Mateo! Come on. If there's one thing I never could forget about my girlfriend is its reflection. She was always my priority needed more of it. She was not selfish. Why stop? It is already dark. I'll light the lights. Odav?a But if we have not done! I have to turn on the lights. What is it, Matthew? I have to turn on the lights. Can not you do next? No. "Twenty dollars? Make it fifty! You're too old. Hopefully I've spent only fleas. Give me the cash. That's all I have cattle during the day. Pay a little more. I have no money. I want a few dollars more! Even if I register, there is no money in my pockets. I can ask my friends give you a beating. Take off your clothes. I already do. Also shorts. Wait, I took them off. Toma. Hurry! It's getting late. Wait! How do you want to suck his cock when does not have enough dough to pay for it? Fucking hustler! Chapero teenager, are already an old boy! When Ligaya and their parents were agree to marry me, I was excited. Repeatedly I thanked the Lord. My mother asks about our plans to get married. We are together almost three years. I still remember when we met? Hardly. You're the one who has courted me. You're like a goat. I like you too. Things are going too fast between us. He visits here every day. I hope that when we have a son, is as handsome as you. I want us to look after our children between them. I do not want any of us have to go to work abroad. Children do not like that sort of thing. Parents should never leave their children. I saved a lot decent money! Ten thousand dollars! I think we can afford to get married. What is the problem, Matthew? My job is very stable. What should I do to get a decent life? But I have my own income. You can work at the factory, on St. Thomas. My mother can help to find a job there. It's really hard to decide on these issues. You have no balls to decide about anything! We can talk about this. I'm late. You're right. It's late! Unfortunately, our marriage will not was possible and did not clarify things. Why is your wedding with Ligaya Lorica was not possible? Because the fairy appeared before me. The elf? Perida, what happened? Why are you naked? Do you raped? 'd Rather be raped. Some kids from the city took away clothes and took off. Here, take this. Thank you. Why let the kids you scoff? I'm used to. Since little has been teasing me. My father even beat me with his belt. And I hung upside down. So what's new? I like him I was. Do you hate your father? I can not blame him. Who wants a fairy child? But you can hide the fact being gay, right? But I will not. It is that I am. That's why I left home. Lest anyone can interfere in my life. If they do not like me, do not care. What matters is that I'm happy. Are not you afraid that the fairy you appear? The fairy never reveals itself and not to me. For I am the fairy! The fairy was so beautiful. It's the kind of woman, that all men always seek. It is the woman every man dreams of. Who is Fidel? Is it the man she married Ligaya? Fidel was the elder brother of Ligaya. We became best friends. We had a deep friendship. It was more than a brother to me. Mr Jerome, this is Matthew. It may accompany up to Wolf. Wow, your car is very well. It's a bit old. It is the first time I travel in a very nice car. Really? Lord a donation to the Virgin Mary. Thank you. For what is money? The celebration of the city are nearby. We celebrate with a lot of food. Sorry, your car will not think I can of this road. This is fine. I like to travel climbed in the jeep. By the way. How old are you? Twenty. Twenty How long have you worked in Lighthouse? Some three years. Three years. So are you Wolf? I do not come from Albay Bicol. Well, that "So what? That explains your accent. By the way, where is your family? They are past. My mother died three years ago. I have no brothers. My father is a foreigner. My life is like a melodrama. That's not melodramatic. My father is dead after a long illness. What is your work in Manila? Working in an advertising agency as editor. We do advertising. Are the ads? Yes Television commercials. You'll meet a lot decebridades. Some. Do not have plans to return to college? I just want to be a sailor. But no one sent me to school. Why not your father sent you the uni? My father does not know me. He left us when I was five. I came here to buscalo only to discover who is in Dubai. When you return you can send. I'm not even sure if he still recognizes me. This is precious. My aunt would love. You mean you can buy this place? Perhaps. Let's go swimming. Es una pasada! A good place to swim. Wait for me! The water is very good. Let's dive in and see who holds more. Let's make a deal. What we wager? Should win "We meet again to drink? Not that. And what happens if you lose? I can ask you to do any thing and I will. Anything? Yeah, whatever. Started. On three, 1, 2, 3! You're a cheater! Are you an expert on this. Sure, but do not ask me. So give me driving lessons. Can I choose? It's great to swim here. Come here. This place is wonderful. Only Fidel knew me inside and out all my dreams fears uncertainties in life. Mateo. Where you going? I have driving lessons. "Driving? Who is the teacher? Mr. Jerome Just know that guy and and you are asking a big favor. Mr. Jerome is a good person. Why do you need to learn to drive? One never knows. I could find another job. That's your choice. I wasted my time coming here. Please do not be angry. I gotta go. Mr. Jerome could leave. Good. Come on, you can do. That's how these things the first time. Just take it easy. Sorry to ruin the car, not I have money to pay for damages. Do not worry about that. If you got along so well with Fidel, Why he did not help Ligaya at her wedding? Two nights before the wedding day, Fidel and I had decided going to celebrate. Even thought in recruiting a prostitute. However, we reached the money. So we decided to drink overnight. Fill the glasses. Think you can with one more? Yes! My turn. I'm way ahead. Sure. You are a cheat. Am I cheating? That's fair enough. This is my last drink. I am reporting morning at the factory. We're not drunk and because you want Piraro. Do you speak German again? You must be very drunk. I agree, you're drunk. Gotta go. Be careful. Care could satisfy fairies on the way home. That would be great. Long ago I have no sex. What if you find Perida by the way? "Perida? Yes Well, he can take me as long as me some rice cakes. I agree with that, even for a rice cake. I think we should help you get home. Very drunk. Hardly worth by itself. Return in case, some want to drink more. Go with care guys. They are very drunk and the road is dangerous. Let's drink some more. Are you sure you can take more? Are you leading? This shot is mine! Next time I'll invite you to drink something really hard. The juice is boiled with trumpet lily. Please check and try and how strong you are. What do you call? "Trumpet Lily? Yes, it is a plant that has color white and pink flowers. She looks like a bell. Tomorrow, I'll make you try my bell. Really? Bang Bell tomorrow! This shift is mine! Come! Now, my turn. Your turn. In your dialect, what is called someone who is drunk? Buyong AAHHH! So I'm buyong. Bako PA. What does P Bako? Not yet. You're drunk. You're very drunk! Not yet. Want more? This shift is mine. It's mine. I'll win. You can not. You're too drunk. If I can. This is for you. I told you. You're the one who is drunk, not me. In our city, there is a problem with a lady. Sometimes she washes her What do you do? Wash the hell! What vulgarity! Matthew, what is the wildest thing you tried on sex? Suzet and I experienced a lots of stuff. "All the experience and ingenuity for the same sex? None. None? Even a simple change of positions? None. How about you? Many especially with men. With men? Why? Do you find repulsive? Not at all if what you want. What if a guy wanted sleep with you? And you with him? Depends Depends on what? I do not know Matthew, you're like a Cuba. No, I'm not. You've been a good spark. Not yet. You're so drunk you do not give no account you wear the zipper is open! Let's close it. V?mnos! Look at you, I told you so. You're already drunk. What was your song? Do we sing again? Mateo! Mateo! Mateo! Please look at this. My Aunt Jo brought him from Hong Kong. Looks delicious! It's really good. You sweat. Why do not you change your shirt? Later. Let's try these imported delicacies. Ronel has been saying the whole kind Your father will come tomorrow. He promised even some chocolates. What is your plan? Are you going to introduce you to him tomorrow? Do not know. What do you mean, that do not know? Have you been waiting for this chance long ago? Want to ask Mr. Atienza? Do not meddle in the matter. I have my own strategy. Strategy? You have no strategy! The moon was full on the eve of my Ligaya wedding. We ran out of drinks. So I thought of boiling trumpet lilies. Can the fairy be a hallucination due to the effect of the trumpet lily? It is getting cold. Probably December. Morning Mr. Fernando Atienza arrives. I'm going back to Manila. Get it Matthew? This is my last night here. I will miss this place. When I was young, my father told me that Manila is a beautiful place. He even promised to take there one Christmas. I'll be stuck in my office cubicle. Chained to my tie. Have spent countless Christmases. Pero nunca he tenido la oportunidad para ver Manila. Estoy a la espera de mi sueldo. Voy a dar la mayor parte de ?l a mi familia. Y un poco para m?. Mi padre es como Santa Claus. Siempre se le espera pero nunca llega. ?Por qu? no dices nada? ?Pap?? La gente pensaba que yo era la ?nica persona que vio el hada esa noche. ?Qu? quiere decir? Los de la sierra, ambos vieron el hada en esa fat?dica noche. Jer?nimo. Jer?nimo. Mateo. Mateo. ?Est?s bien? S?, lo estoy. Ten?a miedo de ped?rtelo. ?Pedir el qu?? Esto T? We can be together. How far. Want to go on vacation? Where? A Manila. You can work there. You can study. I'm afraid. Do not worry. Take care of you. I am alone in my apartment So you want to join me? Please come with me. I love it. But my dad coming today. I've been waiting for this moment so long. Okay. I understand. I want the mp3. That's not yours. This is mine. Guys, enough of fighting. Learn to share things with each other. I will buy another so do not worry. Please call the maid to you can prepare food. Help with these boxes, Help me Arman. Dad, do you have rubber shoes I've asked? Of course! How can I forget the request of my only boy! Dad, I'm no longer a toddler. I'm a man now. Oh, I hardly noticed. Check this box signal. Be very careful. There are a lot of fragile items. My gift to you is also within of the box. Be careful with it. Honey, Arman will take over the boxes. Arman who take care of those boxes. The food is getting cold. Have to change. You're soaked in sweat. Ronel, "your father gave you rubber shoes? I have not seen yet. Dad, do not miss the 3D cinema in the new shopping center in Manila. Oh yes. The dinosaurs in the movies are huge and seem real. Is there anybody home? I think there is someone out. Good morning! Good morning, what can I do for you? Pa, Who is he? I'm Matthew. Linda's son in Albay. Navy, the food is cold. Hi Matthew, why are you here? I just wanted to see if Mr. had arrived. I'm off. Let the food is cooled again. Come on! Damn! I recognized! I recognize that his own son! The experience was difficult to explain. It was like a dream. A very beautiful dream. The call of the fairies is difficult to ignore. I found myself after unforgettable voice She took me to heart the forest. Mr Jerome, anyone asking for you. Who? Do not know. That man is there. "Matthew? Let's put some of these. They are very good. It is the first time I eat spaghetti with a white sauce. Come with me I'm hungry. Do not worry. Just enjoy the meal. How's your father? Well, he's here. And what did he say? Nothing. Nothing? Do not you recognize me? No. No? Why not show? He is happy now with his own family. Later, I learned that Ligaya nearly lost his sanity. However, during those times, Ligaya faded from my memory. The fairy mean the world to me. Wow, my kitchen is spotless. Well, did nothing I started to clean it. You speak German again. Sorry. I said, now that I am not doing anything, I prefer to clean it. Do not you think it will be uncomfortable with your friends? Uncomfortable "why? For me. My friends are very intelligent, and they know a lot about you. I have told them things about you. What did you say? I said, I met a man Wolf handsome and affectionate. And who is the king of my life. I do not know you. You were so busy that you act with us. Why do not you join us? Do not worry Matt. We can help. Mayoi not worry about it she can always help itself! That's rude! Do not you consider Mateo. Matthew, join us. Come here. He is very quiet. Hello Friends. That voice sounds familiar. My friends are here, together, with my favorite cakes. Is that all that remains? No problem, please. Aya, Carlos, this is Matthew, my boyfriend. They are pretending to be as good people. That we can say. Sit Mateo. How are you? The fairy world is so different from ours. The myths of this world is living in his kingdom. At present, we are studying how Filipinos are effective when it comes to lying. Lies not in common, but equally than they do in an Internet chat. Defend me, man. As if we never lied to us! That boy Sarg you say you just met few days ago. But we knew you've been seeing with for months! People might think I'm committed to it. I do not want to create this type of printing. Do not blame Mayoi. always do Sarg jokes especially when he says Hey guys, did you eaten? I ate! Please enough. To be fair to Sarg. He is a piece of a man. But if I had been blessed with some human form of intelligence, he never would relate with a woman like her! You're a bitch! That's bad! Do not worry. Mayoi is a emotionally stable woman. Do not get angry easily and never take revenge against anyone. Matthew is very quiet. Have you eaten? Sarg Forget! It was just a joke. My life in the world of fairies is far from easy. However, my dear fairy never left me. Here is a juice, ma'am. Thank you. Sit a while. Jerome Where did you meet? In Wolf. Wolf? Yes Lobo, Batangas. So, you are a native of Batangas. No, ma'am. I'm from Bicol, in Albay. Jerome Do you treated well? Yes ma'am. Jerome was very kind to me. That's good to know. Please do not call me ma'am. Just call me Aunt Lucy. Yes, Aunt Lucy. Hi mom! Hope you're not Matthew questioning. I'm being nice to him! Why would I do that? I fear that with the way do the questions Of course, you have the money need this month. Son, do not tell him of the needs of Ria to buy some books? This is not enough. Mom, you know for a fact that my wage has not increased yet? And I'm having trouble with what is left of my money. Mom, please Be careful of the books of Ria. Why not get funds pension received? The money I receive from the pension is not even enough for me. Do not worry, as soon as graduation is Ria go to the United States, and end your responsibilities with us. Please tell Gabby I am reviewing the work. Can I find work? What kind of work? Waiter, concierge. "Conserjel? Yes, like what used to do in Faro. Work on the lighthouse is different working as a doorman here in the city. Why not try to find a test academic at the University of the Philippines? You're good at painting and drawing. You may be able to obtain a certificate. In the University? I will not be able to pass the exam. In the world of fairies. you forget that you only a mere mortal. You are able to do things not even imagine at the thought of a wild dream. I can not. Just try it. Come, try, suck. "I should not be doing this? Why? Because I am not gay. Hello, sir. Are you a new boyfriend Mr. Jerome? No! I'm his cousin. Why do you say we are cousins? Because it is embarrassing for me. Are you ashamed of what Nuesto? "Ours? In case you have not noticed I'm in your life! Do not make a scene. Just forget it. Why?, Are you ashamed of me? Not that. I am ashamed with others. What are you ashamed? You're embarrassed that you're gay! Do not force the issue. These starting to annoy me. "Why can not you just accept that you're gay!? If you can not, there is no reason to this relationship exists! ! Damn, do not force the issue! You're gay! You're queer! Fuck you! Fagot! You son of a bitch! When I came here again things had changed. Fidel married. Ligaya became seriously ill. I have not had the courage to address them. But according to history, What if the fairy reveals herself to a man, man will not be able to marry? That's right. But if the fairy revealed itself Fidel, how he married? Some things are beyond explanation. Because people are narrow-minded. But more than anything else. Rather than accepting others. What's more important is the freedom of the human spirit. Matthew Where have you been? I went on vacation. Do not tell me let me. He was deeply worried about you. I'm sorry if I hurt you. I'm still here. We can always recover our past. Please forgive me. I can not continue our relationship. Now I know why men have created the myth of the lighthouse tale.
