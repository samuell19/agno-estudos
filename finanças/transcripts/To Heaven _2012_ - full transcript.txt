TO HEAVEN Hello. She always wants to come here in order to see you. The food's ready. I'm coming. Jony, you're going to scare someone to death. - Just like what happened to Grandpa? - He went to heaven. Cut it a little bit thicker. Are you coming to eat, Mom? - May I say the prayer? - Of course. Dear Lord in heaven, bless our food and help those who have nothing. Please bless me and my family. - Thank you, God. Amen. - Amen. From the heart of the Church. An interview with Dr. Joaquín Navarro... I knew that we would win. Just a tiny bit more. One possible reason suicide is suspected. We should remember that Pagani had previously had such tendencies... Regrettably it is now clear, ...that the Frontman of Noche Negra has died at the age of 37. The police have closed the road, ...but a number of fans have already erected a memorial. As yet there is no official information about the cause of death. However, it is believed that this was suicide. Neither the police nor the family have made a statement yet. In a few minutes we will be reporting live from his home. Richardo Pagani, the lead singer for the punk band Noche Negra, ...in which he was lead singer for many years, has died. - Eat some fruit. - I already ate. - Come on, one apple. - I'm not hungry. ...more and more people are coming to the scene of the accident, ...where fans have spontaneously erected a memorial. - Don't you want some breakfast? - I'm late. I'll eat later. Alright. Take care of yourself. Andrés, come over here. Here are the new flyers. Four-color printing. I think that these will work better. Because now everything that we sell is printed on them. - How do you like them? - They're completely different from before. People will be snatching them out of your hands. ...a cardiovascular collapse... ...and we suspect that he was a man in poor health. Hi, Grandma. Mom, it's smearing. Hello. Marita was here. We had a long talk. She said that there's a youth group at the church at the moment. They organize lectures and activities. - And they always need new people. - Interesting. Cry in silence. Cry as much as you want, but not these tears. - How's it going? - Good. I brought you something. A pick. It was lying on the road. - Cool, thanks. - I found it by chance. Who knows who could have lost it. Several experts have said that this was suicide. In fact, Pagani had already attempted to take... his own life in the past. It is also expected that Pagani's drug and alcohol use may have been a factor, which unfortunately is so characteristic of the rock scene. It's therefore presumed at the moment, that it was suicide, caused by drugs and alcohol. Pagani has been on medication for high blood pressure for years. Therefore multiple factors played a role in this predictablely tragic end. Where is your brother? - Marita? - There you are! Hello. How are you? - Hello, kiddo. - Say Hello. - Is your husband upstairs? - Yes. He just arrived. - They're all upstairs. - We're really late. - There's even someone new in there. - Oh yeah? - Yes. - Great. - You'll like it. - See you later. - Hello, Andrés. Youth Group - Hello, how are you? - Thank you. - Hey, everything alright little one? - Yes. - Yes? Are you excited? Well, that's good. - Yes. This is Andrés, my eldest. - Nice to meet you. How are you? - Good. - You've never been here before, right? - Just when he was little. All right. These are changing times. Times when God does great things. Please make yourself right at home. - Better late than never. - Yes. - The main thing is you came. - Exactly. - God be with you. Have fun, go on in. - Come on. Come in. Andres! - How's it going? - All right? - Everything good? - Yes. Why haven't I seen you around here anymore? Nothing came of it. There's no point to it. My mother saw you at Church. My mother's pushing the panic button because of Pagani. Mine doesn't know anything about it. I haven't seen you in church in forever. This is warm. The tribute concert is on monday. They want to continue without him. - Yes, but it won't be the same. - No. - I never saw him live. - Shit. They were the best. Pagani was just unbeatable on stage. I only have the videos. This is a beautiful hummingbird. And these are his weapons of seduction. - You want some bread? - Yes. Can I change the channel? Yeah. Go ahead. - Has anyone called? - No. I'm exhausted. Today a boy your age came in. Ten stitches in his head and they pumped his stomach. Beautiful weather today. It's still very nice. Yes, the sky is clear. ...God is also known as Jehovah. And Jehovah has appointed him to be prince over his people. We have been blessed by our Lord Jesus Christ. 10% of our income we put aside for God. And 90% are blessed. 90% bless the Lord. You all must be focused on the Lord. My brothers, God performs miracles. In chapter three verse ten we read, ...God talks about your miseries... Goodness, I'm still deeply moved. Are we buying a cake? Yes, cake! Anibal, watch out. - Hello. - Hello. I'm Andrés. My mother spoke with Érica. Oh, hello. How are you? We'll get started soon. Listen, we are a very supportive group. We place great importance on being there for each other. Not only for spiritual problems... Álex, what do you want to do? Do you want to play right now? ...I'm sure you'll fit in quickly. Come on, I'll introduce you to the others. Okay, let's get started. There's one other piece of good news, not the first one today. Today, we have someone new. His name is Andrés. - Andrés, this is the group. - Hello. You have a moment to get to know everyone. Just take a seat. Wonderful. Let's get to work. - What your name? - Andrés. - And you? - I'm Noelia, that's Romi. Hello. How are you? Everything all right? - Hello. - Hello. - Everything good? - Yes. - Excellent. Wonderful. Thank you. - Welcome, Andrés. - Thank you. Let's all face forward, so we can get to know each other. - Let's start here. - Noelia. - Romi. - Juan Pedro. - Soledad. - Melisa. - Marcos. - Federico. - Augustina. - Mercedes. - Is it my turn? - Yes. - My name is Pedro. Great. - Romi, Happy Birthday! - All the best. - Great. How old are you today? - 22 22, great. We'll celebrate a bit later. Then we can all hang out together for a while longer. Today we will once again discuss a variety of topics. And firstly I want to talk with you about the topic of happiness. What do you think happiness is? Romi, our birthday girl. What do you think about it? - What is happiness? - Yes. - Having a birthday? - Yes, and friends to celebrate with. And Fede, what is happiness? For me it's an ideal situation, when everything is beautiful. - Peace is happiness. - Question: Is that something you have? Or something that you can achieve in life? It can be achieved. Happiness is like a road. For me, it's something you learn on a daily basis. Good. Someone just tossed around the topic of peace. Do you think that peace and happiness are the same thing? No, actual... Yes. There isn't much difference between those two words. So, I guess you can't be happy without peace. But they aren't the same. It seems more like peace is a part of happiness. Or both are part of an even greater good. They don't need to be considered separately. I think that everyone finds happiness in different ways. I'm happy, but my life isn't particularly peaceful. But I'm happy. A person who doesn't have peace, can't be happy. A person has to be at peace with themself, in order to be fulfilled. And not with others? You need to live with others in peace. Excellent. Christ says, that you only feel true happiness, ...when you have God in your heart. I would like to say two words: understanding and communion. - Communion. - In what sense do you mean? Through God you can find yourself, right. And that will bring you peace. - Here comes the birthday cake. - Watch out! Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Romina, happy birthday to you. Today you should be happy and celebrate with your friends. May God protect you and bring you peace today. And many more years. - How beautiful! It's great. - You can exchange it if you like. - Let me see. - Let me see it. - That's really pretty. - Do you think so? - Yes, try it on. - Just the top? Alright. Were you at the church? Yes. I'm helping with the costume party. It's nice to see you joining in. You see, it isn't that bad. No. All right. Bye. See you tonight. Bye, Mom. Bye. That was the second replacement. Then in 1989 Rosetti joined on drums. And in 1991 they had a falling out, even though the guy was a real genius. After that came Pocho. He had been friends with Pagani his entire life. And he's stayed with them for 20 years. They never fought, well, nothing serious. There have been arguments, but that happens in every band that's been together for 20 years. There's a really good band, at the church. - What are their names? - No idea. Who can compete with Noche Negra. Why do the good musicians always die and the bad ones continue to play? It isn't fair. That's just the way it is. Blessed be God! - Blessed be God! - Blessed be God! The last compounds we have, are the hydrocarbons. Consider a hydrocarbon... ....replace a hydrogen with a hydroxyl group... ...we get an alcohol. If we then oxidize that alcohol... ...we get an organic acid. Alcohol can be oxidized with a mild or harsh agent. If we oxidized alcohol with a mild agent, it initially produces an aldehyde. The harsh oxidation of a primary alcohol... ...leads to an organic acid. Let's review: Alcohols are classified as primary, secondary and tertiary. With the secondary alcohol, as we know, the CO group is bonded between two hydrogen atoms. What do you think is so funny, Andrés? The alkanes, the primary alcohols, the acids? What was so funny?? Nothing. Then stop that nonsense and watch yourself. All right. Give us some of that stuff you're smoking. Where were we? In the secondary alcohol the CO group... You do stupid things too. ...Alkyl group or an aryl group. It goes through the circuit board. - So it's intertwined? - Exactly, intertwined. From here to here. Where it stops, and comes out of a bar code. - Some kind of bar code? - Yeah, Some kind. - When are you getting it? - The holidays. - Should I do it? - If that's what you want. - If it's okay. - Of course. - I'll give you my number afterwards. - Alright. Let's do this. - What are you doing on Saturday? - Nothing. Are we doing something? - Absolutely. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Can we both bring someone else with us? - Alright. What a commotion, right? Excuse me. - Hello. - Hello. Here. Thank you. How are you mate? - Hello. How are you? - Good. And you? I'm exhausted. Too much work. - I've got a lot of work. - Oh Yeah? What do you do? Customer specific sales of perfume products. Do you have a job? Yes. I'm a dog sitter. Much continued success. That's Álex. He always smokes in here and leaves the butts. The water is ready. The overdose is a lie, in order to cover up the truth. They let him die. Where were the people that he was always helping out with money, they let him down. They just exploited him. On stage he was always unique. On stage he had a lot of power and radiated a lot of love, Anarchy and real conviction, you know? But he died from an overdose? I mean, he was more and more addicted to using drugs. But he knew his stuff. This was no overdose. Someone is hiding the truth here. That story about an overdose is a lie. They let him die. They let him die. The only thing we have left of him now is his music. His lyrics totally influenced me, me and a lot of other people. That's why we're here. That's why all this is happening. Because of what he meant to us. His ideology lives on through us. Pagani is not dead. Pagani! Noche Negra! "PAGANI IS NOT DEAD" What is full of the mercy of Jehovah? - The... - Earth. - The... - Earth. The Earth. Praise be to God. The Earth is full of the mercy of the Lord. A round of applause for the Lord's mercy. Praise be to God. How wonderous is our Lord. How wonderous is our Lord. - It's so nice of you to remember. - What's wrong? "What's wrong"? We've been waiting for you for two hours. But I'm here now. It's always the same, we're stuck waiting here. - Let's get started now. - Here we go. - Just leave it. - It's completely unacceptable. This crap thing. I just wanted to listen to Marita. But what are you dressing up as? An Empanada. And you? As God. I need some rest. - Do you have a lot of work? - Yes, but I can handle it. Fortunately, we have these meetings to motivate and give us strength. But there are always those who don't want to work. - They don't have initiative. - Well, take it easy. - Do you work? - I pass out flyers. Some people are like that naturally. And others are not. - Who is it? - Andrés, Sandra's son. - I brought you a few things. - Just a moment. You saved me. Thank you. Oh, how... Look, how lovely. Should I give you the money right now? - Yes, if you please. - Wait, I'll be right back. I'm just about to put the final details on the costume. Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit... ...as it was in the beginning is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit... ...as it was in the beginning is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. Glory be to the Father and to the Son... Goodbye, my dear. And say hello to your mother. What is this? It looks pretty. I'm gonna fuck you up. - You doing anything this weekend? - No. My mother found my cigarette butts. You're an idiot. But she'll allow you to go to the church festival. Since they're really just serving soda. I'd rather stay home and jack off. If you say so. Take that. That one. - That one? - Okay. - Here you go. - Thank You. - Alright, thank you. - Bye. - Hello. - Hello. Bye. - Who was that you said hello to? - A guy from church. - Hey, which way are you going? - This way. - Do you live around here? - Yeah. I'm Álex. I'm Andres. This is my brother Jona. - A peso! - Score. - You like Noche Negra? - Yeah. Me too. All this stuff with Pagani is really messed up. Yeah. The guy was a genius. One of the first songs that I liked, was one of theirs. - Which one? - "Abísmos", it's one of my favorite songs. They always played it as their concert finale. It's insane. - I've never seen them live. - No. - That's too bad. - Yeah. And you? What kind of music do you play? I... I don't know how to describe it. I don't know. You should hear us sometime. You rehearse regularly? At the moment, less frequently, but we've been trying to get discovered. We want to play more concerts again. There were a few issues, but we're gonna be okay. - Do you play anything? - I just started playing the guitar. - You need to practice a lot. - Yeah. - Marita. - Hello. - Hello. - It's nice to see you again. - You look great. - Do you know me again? - You look stunning. - Really nice, yes. - How sweet of you. Thank you. - You really look great. What was that again, what did you learn yesterday? Álex! How nice. It's nice that you came. I'll get you a costume. - No. - Yes, yes. Wait. Wow, it's great! - Come on, let's dance. - Later. Where's Romi? She's dancing right now. She's really cute. She's pretty sexy in her cowgirl costume. The costume is really awesome. She's really pretty cute. - God bless you. - God protect you. - Fernando, how are you? - Good. - And the choir? - It's doing all right. - Have patience. You need to have patience. - Right. - Come on, let's go. - No. - Come on, for a little while. - No. - You want to get out of here? - All right. - You don't like that kind of dancing? - No. Me neither. Why did you start going to church? It just happened. And you? Lucas arranged it. They let us rehearse next door, so I go. - And your costume? - I got it from my father. What about you? No. I have no idea where my father lives. None at all. I meant your costume. That was from Marita. She gave it to me. It's out of here. You want this back? - Do you want something to drink? - Yes. - I'll get more soda. Are you enjoying the party? - It's good. - Yeah? - And you? - Also good. - Good? - Yeah. I'm having a lot of fun. Oh yeah? In spite of everything. - Hello. - Hello. Everything alright? Come on? Dad is already waiting in the car. Alright. That was a lot of fun. Everyone looked really great. And she had everything organized. It was really nice. Yeah. We haven't danced that much in a long time. - See you tomorrow. - Chau. The old maze-like brick house. Do you remember my brother, those beautiful afternoons? When we heard the train nearby, my brother... ...it brought new yearnings. Where is your garden? Where is the well? Do you remember my brother, that fair place... Because of the church festival, our activities became confused. - Hello. - Hello. Okay, we need to go back over a few things. Since the topic is drug addiction. It's a very common problem, that particularly affects the young. Who doesn't have a friend or family members... ...experiencing problems with drugs? He's a little weird. All right, that's it. Érica, I have some videos that fit the situation quite well. Fantastic. Great, then we'll look them over. - We don't know anything about him. - We should help him. Mati, will you turn off the lights? He said: "Uncle, you don't know, but I also take drugs." When he told me that, my tears began to flow. I take apart a pen and use the plastic shell. I hold the shell in my hand, and while driving... ...I do this, and that's it. Then that satisfies my desire, and I need to do it over and over again. I've already tried to quit many times... All right. That was a very clear account. We'll talk it over now... ...what do you think about what we just watched. I would like to know what you think about it. - Who wants to go first? Andrés? - I have to go. It's totally stuffy in here. You need to open a window. Let's see if you can get it right the first time. PAGANI LIVES Hello, Marita. When should Marita come over? Mama isn't back yet. She will be here later today. Mama isn't back yet. She will be here later today. That's good. She said she will come over tomorrow. - ...on the dinner table. - You would be completely blown away. She's always doing something in the house. And those two are so sweet. - She's always doing things out of love. - Yeah. She was eager to provide us with everything. Very agreeable. How wonderful. How are you? - Nice to see you you enjoyed it. - Yes. - Hello. - Really nice. - You want something to eat? - I bought something at a kiosk. All right. - After so long, it was really nice. - Yeah. She had been missing me. Seeing people that you hold dear is very nice. These young people. Rejoice, because Jesus loves you! I'm telling you a lot of people are like that. Yes, I'm quite aware of that. - Cut it out. - They roam the streets. Yes. But what are you doing here, Marita? I'm trying to get as close him as possible. And talking with him. But at that age they're complicated. Sometimes it's counterproductive, they want to control everything. That's right. But you've seen the way he always is. - Is everything alright with you? - Yeah, Mama. It's still inflamed. Why didn't you say something? Don't give me that look. What do you expect? I'm concerned. Great. We need to start a band. - How's it going with the guitar? - I still don't have my half. Your half? What are you doing with your dough? - What dough? - What you earn in that Empanada costume. It isn't that much. I like the name Furia Letia Letal a lot. (Angry Karaoke Lyrics) That's already been used. Where? - The lip ring looks great. - You like it? It's inflamed. This morning pus came out. - Pus! That would be a good name. - Sounds good. Yesterday I listened to Noche Negra's last album, the one with "Caer". (Fallen) At one point, he says. "I'm out of the game, no more rock for the fallen. It's always the same movie." It's obvious that the guy wanted to kill himself. - You see that? - What? Oh, nothing. That's my bike. Sorry. We're going straight to the church. - What? - We're going straight to the church. I can't, I have to study. - Today is the live-broadcast. - But we can listen to it here. Pity. Érica asked about you. - I didn't know what to say. - What? - She asked about you. - Who? - Érica. - What did you say to her? Nothing. What should I tell her? The food is ready! We're grateful to the Church, For giving us a rehearsal space. It gave me support at a time, when I wasn't doing too well. Thanks to the church, thanks to you and thanks to my brother Álex... ...we can continue onward with our band Constelación. Tonight we're having a concert, to which everyone is invited. - Are you going? - Yeah. - But the food... - It already started. But where... Forget it. It's rock. - We're on in five minutes. - You ready? Is everything set up? The microphones are there. Everything's ready. Great. - Where is Lucas? - Lucas is on the radio. - Why is that? - He doing an interview. - We're going on. - He'll be along. The guy's an idiot. - What the fuck? - I was on the radio. We need you out there, and you just piss off. - Leave that shit. - Who looks after the rehearsal space? Come on, let's go. Asshole. Wait, I'll be right back. - Hey, you came. - Yeah. - It was really good. - You think so? - Yeah. - Are you here alone? - Yes. A round of applause for Ricky's father, who's coming onstage. He deserves it. Thank you very much. Thank you. In short, I want to thank you for this concert, which is being held in honor of Ricardo. And I want to thank everyone who came out on this shitty night, on this sad night for us and those who stood by our family. I thank you on Ricardo's behalf, and on my wife's behalf, Ricardo's mother, our entire family and my own behalf. Thank you. I want to make something clear. Ricardo did not commit suicide. No, no, no. He did not commit suicide. It was an accident. No one determined his fate and his disease itself... - Are you going? - Yes. Look at me. You look so good today. The alcohol had a very strong impact on him. I wanted to ask you: not to change. Stay the way you are. Outwardly wild, but sensitive inside. Okay. Someone once wrote on a wall at my house: "As long as Ricky is alive, Punk lives on." What I say is, as long as there is punk, Ricardo will live among you. Thank you, guys. I love you. Look, it goes like this: A. Then comes F. So this way. - Like that? - No, that's F. Like this. - Now do I have it. - Exactly. Then: A - F - D. - D was that here? - No. No. Yeah, there. Then come C and H. But those two at half tempo. - What is half tempo? - Well, like this. You play half as fast. - That was slower. - Alright. Okay, and then comes A again, and then it starts again from the beginning. Now you play it.
