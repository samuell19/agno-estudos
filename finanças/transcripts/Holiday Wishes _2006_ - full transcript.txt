[Music - "santa baby"] Badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom. Badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom. OK. 10 minutes to recaffeinate. [Sighs] DANNI [VOICEOVER]: So let's see, that's the last of the decorations. Now all we have left is the food, refreshments, the charmingly casual gift baskets that everyone will think took 10 minutes to put together but will be remembered for a lifetime. Oh, no. That'll be no problem at all. Money, money, money-- Coffee, coffee, coffee-- JEREMIAH: Looks like quite the Christmas you're planning on there. - Oh, god. [Chuckles] It's not my stuff. I'm a party planner, and I'm right in the-- Jeremiah. Hi. DANNI: You work here? Grande nonfat latte, with a little cinnamon on top in honor of the season. I saw you come in. Well, you are one step ahead of me because I did not see this coming at all. Come on. What, you're not a little bit happy to see me? We haven't seen each other in what? 3 years, 6 months, 12 days. Wow. You remember. Yes, shockingly, I remember. I remember how [giggles] you decided to save the world by taking that teaching job overseas. I remember how we had conversations about you e-mailing, us keeping in contact. And you know what I really remember? I remember how none of it happened at all. All my emails bounced back. My letters were returned. I'm sorry. Oh, come on, Jeremiah. You're letting your side down. Don't you guys always have totally rational explanations for blowing us off? Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't call. I was in the middle of a war zone. Oh, my gosh, I couldn't call because you know what? There's no phone at the summit of Everest. Isn't there like a handbook or something you can consult? [Laughs] Well, we're picking up right where we left off. Danni, [sighs] I couldn't write. I couldn't contact anyone. I'm-- I'm very sorry about that. You know what? Doesn't make a difference. I've moved on, new city, new life, new-- New man? Not yet, but I'm working on it. Good for you. I wish you all the best. Because when we were together, you were so obsessed with the past that we could hardly focus on the present. If you're talking about my sister, I'll have you know that I was right. I do have a sister, and I am very, very close to locating her. Danni, don't you think it's time that you moved on with that part of your life? Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I have an appointment, I'm late. Got to go, bye-bye. Want your coffee? No, thank you. [Sighs] EDDIE DURAN: What, you don't have the time in that car? You think I got time to spend hanging around on the street? DANNI: I got shanghaied by the past. I'm sorry. EDDIE DURAN: These are the documents I got from the orphanage where you were raised. I got a contact inside to give up a couple of crumbs, these. DANNI: This is the photo I remember, me and my sister. I can't believe you found this. I've been looking for this for so many years. May I keep this? Sure, you can keep those. You have to be close. You have documents. You know about my sister. Not so fast. Now, I have the name of the hospital. I have the birth date. Now, anything more is going to take money. I gave you $3,000. Right. And that covered exactly three weeks work. These adoption records are sealed up tighter than a drum. If you want information, you're gonna need the right person to help out. And I can tell you right now, they're gonna want to be paid. Another two grand should keep us in business. What do you care? You're not doing too badly, judging by all that Christmas shopping you got back there. Those aren't mine. Those are for the people I work for. It's what I do for a living. I make wonderful Christmases for other people. But you know what? I deserve a decent Christmas this year, and you're just the man who's going to give it to me, Mr. Duran. - Yeah? Well, I'm gonna do the best I can, but I'm still gonna need some cash. Oh, I understand. I'll get it. [Crowd shouting merry christmas] [chuckles] Christmas makes everybody crazy. CLAUDIA: OK, one more time. Their name is the Bradleys-- Come on, Rachel. Help me out here. Rick and Eve, two children, Sam and Dodie. They own their own business. They're both numbers of the local chapter of the Rotary Club. He enjoys fishing and soccer and TV, and she has her own custom knitting service on the side. Oh, and they really, really like kids. Good. You'll see, this is going to be a good placement. It's still a foster home. Rachel, I know. And I'm sorry the last one didn't work out. Yeah, they found out they were expecting. Your child's always better than a hand-me-down, right? No one would ever call you a hand-me-down, Rachel. You're an original. You'll see. And to make it even better, we've managed to place you in a very exclusive private school. Great, rich kids at Christmas. This will be so much fun. Honey, you've been through a lot, and I know you deserve something good to happen now. But let's can the attitude and see if we can make this work. OK, kiddo? OK. Good. Oh, look. They have horses. How can that be bad? It's so very wonderful to have you with us, and I think you're going to be real happy here, Rachel. Lots of, uh, fresh air and honest work to build a young person's character. You'll all get along just fine. Rachel loves reading, and she's just learning to knit. EVE BRADLEY: Oh, how wonderful. [Laughs] Why don't you two take Rachel out to see the horses while you both do your chores, hmm? [Horses neighing] I'll be in touch. Just keep thinking positive. OK, Rache? [Horses neighing] [festive music] Yes. Yes, Yes. I know of Carey. He's all about family values. Yeah, Oh, I know, I know. We need the account. That's why I'm having the damned party, Larry. [Chuckles] Larry, Larry, I promise you, we are going to make the Walton family look like the Manson family-- the one with the trees-- no, no, no, no, no, no, Larry. That's Debbie, our party planner, who is a total dream. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh, it's just that working that day is really hard for me because you know, my wife has this-- this huge, uh, Chri-- Chris-- Yeah. No, OK. I-- I understand. Yes, I'll get it done. Don't worry. Thanks, bye. [SARCASTICALLY] Thanks a lot. Oh, [chuckles] Thank you. Just a little distracted in this new job and all. No problem. Uh, listen, I was wondering, if it's not a bad time, could I ask you-- Do you believe Larry? He will not let up about this account. And I have told him a thousand times. We are doing everything possible under the sun. I mean, I don't know. What more can I do than turn my entire house into a client showcase? Debbie, I am so sorry that I have not been able to help you out more, but it's just been so crazy. I-- Wait, Kelly, please. In the last two hours alone I've-- well, I've ordered the floral arrangements. I've gone over the menu with the caterers. I've arranged for the embroidered tablecloths and the aprons for the servers. I frosted all the windows, and I'm just about to finalize the decorations. Do you know what? I think I've got this well in hand. BOTH: You're good. Thank you. Um, since I have you both here, [giggles] I was-- Debbie, I'm sorry. I still don't have a concept for this account, so I am just going to have to lock myself in my office until I can come up with something. Well, actually, um, I have an idea about that, about the account, I mean. Oh, um. OK. Sure, go ahead. Well, didn't you say that your client was launching a new apparel line for teenage girls? KELLY KING: Yeah. And didn't you say he was going to call it "American Daughters?" Yeah, that's the name of the account. Well, I was wondering-- What if we built the entire party around a speech, like Britney? Kind of like a salute to family and how important it is in a young girl's life. And-- and then you can have a contest. And you can find girls from all across the country, and you can put them in your advertisements. And it would be like amazing for publicity, yeah? Oh, my god. I'm sorry. That was like a really bad idea. No, no, no, no. No, actually, that was-- that was good. That was very good. Well, I mean, it's rough. But, you know, I think with a little tweaking, we could actually make this work. Now, the crucial thing is making sure that the client sees it, which means that Britney is key, which-- [giggles] Who am I kidding? Britney will never make that speech. I mean, she would rather see her entire precious wardrobe go up in flames than help her mother. Well, what if I asked her? Now, where is she? In her room. Take a chair and a whip. KELLY KING: Send postcards, Debbie. [Chuckles] Danni. Her name is Danni. I know that. What did you think I just called her? What do you mean, am I going to the Christmas dance? I'm going to own the Christmas dance. So what if I'm grounded. I'll sneak out. My parents are so busy with their jobs. They'll never even notice I'm MIA. DANNI: [KNOCKING ON THE DOOR] Hello, Britney! [LAUGHINGLY] Yeah. [Scoffs] I got go. Yeah, someone's here. I'll IM you it later, OK? Yeah. OK, bye. [Sighs] What? Honey, your mom wanted me to ask if you could write like a really cute little speech for the Christmas party. And why didn't she ask me herself? Well, she thought it might be something that maybe you and I could do together. Wouldn't that be fun? She didn't ask me herself because she thinks I'm too dumb to understand that she needs to make us into this perfect family for that guy, which is a total joke incidentally. And she knew I wouldn't be her trained monkey. What if I asked your mom if you could go to the dance tonight, huh? You'd do that? Maybe. How would I get there? Both my parents are working, and I know they won't let me go alone. I can drive you. And you'll just disappear, right? [SCOFFS] I mean, We don't want you hanging around when I make Kevin Campbell's brains explode from how hot I look. Completely understood. Just so long as you're ready to go, say, after two hours. That should be more than enough time to put Kevin Campbell in a coma. And you got to write the Christmas speech all by yourself. [Sighs] OK. Good. I'll go talk to your mom. [Screams and laughs] [phone dial tone] [horses neighing] SAM BRADLEY: You're not the first, you know. I'm not? No. We got rid of the others, got them shipped back to where they came from. All it takes is the right couple of words. Mom, I saw her taking money from your purse. Dad, she had a boy with her in the barn. I saw her smoking. It's easy. Yeah, I guess so. SAM BRADLEY: But just keep doing what you're doing, and maybe I'll let you stick around for a while. Like for instance, I'm supposed to do the morning waterings at 5:00 a.m. I can take care of it. Sure, you can. There's a few other things, too. But we can start with that 'cause I really hate getting up in the mornings. Oh, yeah. I almost forgot. Mom says you should finish up now. After all, if you're getting up early, you want to get a good sleep. Oh, there. You look beautiful. [Chuckles] Rachel, what do you think? Yeah, r-- really pretty. Next, we'll set you up, too. What? For what? Well, the school Christmas party, of course. Mom, she barely even goes there. EVE BRADLEY: Nonsense. She's going to go to the party, and she's going to look great. Rachel, come upstairs with me. I have some treasures for you to try on. [Upbeat jazz music playing] OK, OK. We meet back here in two hours. Do not make me come look for you. Or I will find Kevin Campbell, and I will tell him that you stuffed your bra with Kleenex. You won't. Oh, you forget, I was 15 once, too. I know all the tricks. Now, go have a good time. Oh. [Giggles] Hello, I really respect you. You do? Sure. I mean, it takes a lot of courage not to care what people think about you. What do you call that, garbage dump chic? BRITNEY'S FRIENDS: [laughing] Burn. [Party music playing] [coughs] Mmm. Jeremiah, what the hell are you doing here? Danni, hi. I mean, uh, oh. Ho, ho, ho. Hang on, I can do better. Now, how's this? Just-- JEREMIAH: How's-- --stop it. It's just so embarrassing. [Sighs] Yeah. Well, like I said, I'm only in town for a little bit. And I've got to pick up work wherever I can. So what brings you to a high school dance? I'm here with my client's daughter. I'm picking her up after the dance. Great. Well, it'll be good practice for when you finally locate your sister. Being here has nothing to do with my sister, Jeremiah. Right. And I was just saying-- --the wrong thing, yet again. Just-- just drop it. Danni, come on. Hey, I'm just-- I'm just trying to get this right. What? What right? I just want to see happy. That's all. You know, Jeremiah, I just wish-- I just wish that-- [sighs] What? What do you wish? Tell me. No, no. I am not going to go through all this with you again. Just leave me alone. [Loud rumbling] I wish I had my own family. [Loud rumbling] [magical sparkling sounds] [loud rumbling] I wish had my sister back. [Loud rumbling] [star twinkling] [loud rumbling] Wish upon a star. Now, give me a pony this Christmas, or I'll absolutely die. Britney, are you OK? Britney-- Uh-oh. [Horses neighing] [suspenseful music] She looks fine. Let's let her sleep a little. [Cars hooting] DANNI: [impatiently] Tsk, come on. [Sighs] [phone dial tone] KELLY [ON THE PHONE]: Hello? - Hi, Kelly. It's Danni. I'm on my way over. KELLY [ON THE PHONE]: Uh-huh. Um, how's Britney doing this morning? KELLY [ON THE PHONE]: Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's fine. Nothing to worry about, just a little bump on the head. [Sighs] I just feel awful about the whole thing. KELLY [ON THE PHONE]: Britney is such a klutz. It's a miracle that she's not in and out of emergency every dongle day. That is one of the reasons why we haven't got her that horse that she's always on about. DANNI [ON THE PHONE]: Well, it's a relief that it's nothing serious. Um, I just wanted you to know how excited, uh, Britney is about the party. [Laughs] Yeah, really. Uh, sure. I mean, once she found out how important it was for you-- Are you serious? I mean, that is terrific because my boss practically cardiaced over how great my "American Daughter" idea is. So we're definitely on for the party. Uh, yeah it's going to be great, Kelly. KELLY [ON THE PHONE]: You know, you've really ramped up the pressure, though. I mean, the whole thing is suddenly riding on Britney's shoulders. Oh, my god, Debbie. What have I done? [Chuckles] Don't worry, Kelly. Britney is going to be great. It's going to be amazing. I promise. This is a disaster waiting to happen. [Alarm going off] [music playing] [horses neighing] [upbeat music playing] Ugh. [Magical, twinkling sounds] [magical, twinkling sounds] [shouts] What? [Sighs] Oh my god, so ghetto. [Scoffs] No, no, no. Maybe I got reincarnated. I got reincarnated rich. BOTH: [SHOUTING] Thank you! Noooo! I have no idea what that was, but that does not sound good. OK, come with me. By the way, I love your hat. EVE BRADLEY: Was that Rachel screaming? [Horses neighing] RICK BRADLEY: I think it was the cat. EVE BRADLEY: We don't have a cat. [CALLING] Rachel, is that you? Rachel! [Playful music playing] Hi, uh, Mum. Um, you can call me that if you want, Rachel dear. Don't you want some breakfast? Sure. Honey, we serve ourselves in this house. Oh, right. RICK BRADLEY: After you kids finish up here, there's some chores in the stable waiting for you. The stable, as in horse stable? Really? DANNI: You'll get through it. KELLY KING: Ha. You should have seen the list for my wedding. Now, that was a nightmare, seven pages long. I don't know how we all got through it without a mental breakdown. DANNI: Wow, your wedding should make this party look like a piece of cake. KELLY KING: There you are. What was all that yelling about earlier? Um, nothing. Were you sick? This sort of thing is exactly the reason your mother and I didn't want you to go to that dance. Wait, mother? Did you-- I have a mother? Yes. Oh, thank you! Thank you! [Chuckles] Goodness. Well, I'm glad you're feeling better honey, but, uh, don't forget you got some writing to do for me later. Oh, gosh. I am so late. I've got to run, bye. Oh, [chuckles] goodness gracious. This happy family thing might just work after all. [Laughs] RACHEL [AS BRITNEY]: Wait, Mom? Mm-hmm? If you're home later, do you think we could maybe hang out or something? Well, I-- I'd love to, hun. But I've got a ton of things to do for work. Anyway, I thought you were going to meet your friends later, do some shopping. Friends? Oh. Um, no, I don't think I'm gonna-- I have a lot of stuff anyway. I don't really need any more clothes. Don't need anything? Who are you and what are you doing with my little girl? Huh? What are you talking about? Oh, ha, you know, just joking. I'm really late. Got to run, bye. Are you sure you're feeling OK, Britney? Yeah, sure. Why wouldn't I be? I'll drop you off. I'm heading in that direction anyway. OK. [Gasps] This is so great. This one will be mine. I'll call him Thunder. Can we go riding? When can we go riding? You're not going riding. You feed them, then you wash them, and then you brush their coats. And when you get finished with that, you clean up the stalls. What? That's-- that's not the way it's supposed to work. I-- I don't even know how to feed them. It's easy, just stand right there. O-- OK, now pull the rope. BOTH: [laughing]. DANNI: OK, I have to be at like a hundred places today. So why don't we meet right back here at, say, I don't know, 3 o'clock? RACHEL [AS BRITNEY]: OK, sure. Thanks, Danni. You sure you're OK? Yeah, I'm all right. I'll see you later. Danni? Did you ever really hope or something, like, more than anything you've ever wanted? Yeah, I have. Well, what happens if you get it, but it's like nothing you hoped it would be? Well, nothing's ever exactly how you think it's going to be. Yeah, but what if it's so weird, that you don't know whether to be really, really happy or really scared? Britney, are you absolutely certain that there's nothing you want to talk about? No. I'm good. Um, thanks. MAN [OVER THE INTERCOM]: Shoppers, Santa's Workshow will be open in 10 minutes. Get the kiddies down to see Santa. Come on, girl. We've got money to spend. OK, how much trouble are you in that you had to wear that dress? Why? I like it. OK. Well, let's get shopping. We'll eradicate that like with a little number from Lemon Beserk. [Horses neighing] This is a nightmare. Go to the dance, where I happened to look adorable. I come home, go to bed, and suddenly I'm Cinderella working for the evil foster kids. Not bad enough that my bod had to disappear. I had a full closet full of chic, and this is all I wind up with. [Sighs] Wait a second, somewhere my closet is probably still there and my house [sighs] and my life. OK, what happened to you last night? Because you totally missed all the excitement. The girl that I was with-- she totally fell, and then she hit her head. And it was horrible. Hey, I'm trying to have a conversation with you here. JEREMIAH: Excuse me, I uh-- [loud crashing] [crowd making surpised noises] MAN IN THE CROWD: Is she OK? Uh, it's a close one. You OK? I love what you-- you've done with the Santa display. It's amazing work. Keep it up. Oh my god, Jeremiah, trouble just seems to follow you around. Danni, ugh. Can I ask you something? Yeah. It's been bugging me. You know when we were first going out? Uh-huh? How come you never told me that you were an orphan? No, I did tell you. Well, no not exactly. I mean, six months later, and I stumbled upon it myself. You were forced to tell me. [Sighs] I know you think I'm living in some fantasy world about having a sister, but I'm not. OK? I don't know about all that, and that's for you to discover on your own. I'm just-- and I know it's hard to do sometimes, but I think it's really important to enjoy life and be happy with what you already have. No, I know what you mean. My client's daughter Britney-- she's got all this stuff, and she's totally unhappy. But you know what the weird thing is? She was like a completely different person this morning. I mean, why is it weird? I mean, at that age you're going through a lot of change, and I-- Why do you care so much? I don't know. I know that I should stay out of it, but I just have this voice in my head telling me that she's in trouble. And I'm the only person who realizes it. You know she's not entirely your responsibility. She has parents. OK, so you're saying that I should stay out of it, that that is the right thing. The right thing? I don't know. That's another question altogether. Now-- [laughs]. --I remember why dating you drove me insane, cute as you are. Oh, yeah? Uh, there's Britney. I told her I'd drop her back at the house. I have to go. OK. Seeing you is always interesting. I can't believe you ate that whole cake. Everybody understands comfort food, Brit. But if you start looking like a Jenny Craig dropout, then, you're going to need to find a new posse [giggles].. Hey, Britney, you ready to go? Yeah [clears throat] In fact, I kind of wish I had even come. MAN [OVER THE INTERCOM]: Attention, shoppers. I had better plates. I just don't know where I put them. Honey, they're fine. Does this say happy family to you? When it's full of food, it's going to say dig in. Can I talk about Britney? Oh, ha-ha. If she thinks that "little miss perfect" act of hers is going to get her that horse she's always wanted, oh, does she have another thing coming. You know what? If it's an act, it's a pretty convincing. Why aren't you using this? This is better. Ugh. Are we talking about the same girl who took my credit card when I wouldn't let her buy a Louis Vuitton handbag and just bought it herself online? Hi, Brit. Tea? Are you hungry? We're just going to get some dinner started. Um, no, thank you. I'm not really hungry. May I please be excused to my room? Sure. Uh, maybe I'll bring some up to you later. I'll go work on the speech for your party, OK? Uh, thanks, hun. She kissed me. Debbie, ugh. I'm so sorry. Danni, would you be a doll and go upstairs and make sure she's really working on that speech? This is way too important for her to come up with something half-baked. You know, I don't think I should get any more involved. Gosh, that's funny 'cause, um, you know, as-- as important as this party is to me-- and, oh boy, is it important-- it is just as important to you. Because, you see, if my firm lands this account, there are going to be all sorts of corporate events and launches and parties, all of which will need planning. Um, I'm just gonna go upstairs and check on her, talk to her. Thanks. [Playful music playing] You've had your fun. Now give me my life back. I-- I don't know what you're talking about. No? Then what are you doing in my room with all my stuff? What do you mean? It's not your stuff. It's mine. OK. Well, then where's your Gucci belt? And what about your Ralph Lauren sunglasses? And what about your Manolos? You don't even know what Manolos are, do you? Brand names don't matter to me. Yeah. Well, they do to Britney King, and that's me. Britney King. Well, there can't be two of us. So maybe you should just leave before I call my parents. They'll know me. Fine, I'll go. But before I do, I'm just going to change something. No, no, no! Don't cut my hair! Oh. [Sniggers] OK, OK. I knew it wasn't right. But I didn't take your life. I mean, I just woke up and I was you. It's not my fault. You wake up totally hot, and I wake up, ew, the nerdy duckling. Who got the better end of that deal? [Phone dialing tone] BRITNEY [AS RACHEL]: If there's a way to change us back, I'll do it. The only question is, how. RACHEL [AS BRITNEY]: I saw a Buffy episode once where they switched bodies using a magical phone booth. BRITNEY [AS RACHEL]: No, I don't see any phones around here, magical or otherwise. RACHEL [AS BRITNEY]: Well, maybe there's some sort of ritual or something we can use. BRITNEY [AS RACHEL]: Oh, great. I'll just go get my book of spells downstairs. I think I forgot it on the coffee table. [Sighs] Well, hey. At least I'm thinking. You're not coming up with anything. Look, my mom's always saying how positive thinking can lead to accomplishments. Why don't we just put our heads together, and, I don't know, maybe we can force ourselves back into each other's bodies. It's worth a try. [Chuckles] You mean like mind meld, like what they do on "Star Trek"? Yeah. Sure. [Chuckles] Cool. [Chuckles] [sighs] OK. Close your eyes and concentrate. DANNI: What are you doing? BOTH GIRLS: [shouting] Look, ladies. I don't know what's going on in here, but I have a huge party that I have to prepare for. And now you just happen to be the most important element, Britney. No, I'm the most important element, not her, me. I'm Brittney. Excuse me? What-- what are you talking about? What-- what are you guys doing in here? Will just somebody please explain? BRITNEY [AS RACHEL]: Danni, I-- I know you helped me get to the dance last night. But this is like so much bigger. This is so mind-blowing that they should be making documentaries about it on PBS or something. OK, you're not making any sense. We aren't who we are. It-- it-- It's not true, it's-- We aren't who we are. Yeah. We're somebody else. We're actually each other. She's me, and I'm-- well, I'm her. OK. So you guys think that you are each other. How hard did you hit your head? We don't even know how it happened, really. We just went to sleep and woke up as each other-- Or at least in each other's bodies. It's Christmas time. People get a little overwhelmed. I know you have a lot on your plate sometimes when you and your little girlfriends get together. We're not friends, though. We don't even know each other. I'm Britney. That's what I've been trying to tell you. OK. Listen, uh, you're Danni Hartford. You've been working for my folks for like two or three weeks. You're planning this huge, stupid party about the American girl, or whatever. OK? Look, there's my Granny King and my Uncle Frank from Elcino, and my Aunt Cece and my Aunt Tonia-- Whoa, she looks so much better with her nose job done, you know? [Laughs] OK, you certainly sound like Britney. It's because I am Britney. I am Britney King. Wait. I think I know where I know you from. You were at the dance last night, weren't you? Oh, right. You were that princess who made fun of my dress. - And you're that foster kid. - Mm-hmm. I'm sorry I was going through your closet. It's kind of Walmart. That does not help. Danni, you're the only one who can help us. Her parents don't even care. There is no one else. I'm banking on you. [Phone ringing] RACHEL [AS BRITNEY]: Please. - O-- OK, stop. Enough. Hello, Danni? It's Duran. I've got something for you. When can we meet? Right away. Um, I-- I'll be there in half an hour. See you then. Thank you, baby. WAITRESS: Any time, honey. Um. I have to go. I will-- I will be back soon. [ANGRILY] Why-- you can't just leave us like this. It's important. [Sighs] What are we supposed to do? Well, don't tell your parents anything. They will lock you both up. Just-- just stay as you are, and we'll figure this out when I get back. You don't understand, we told you. We can't stay as we are 'cause we're not ourselves. We're each other. Just stay calm. I will be back soon, OK? [Sighs] WAITRESS: There you go. You said a half an hour. This is more like an hour. I got here as fast as I could. What did-- What did you find out? WAITRESS: A little more, and you? Oh, no. Thank you. I found this guy, see. He works in records in a hospital in New York, and he has problems making his car payments. And I care about his car payments because-- Because you're going to make it for him. And in return, he's going to make a sealed file unsealed. [Laughs] You want more money. [Giggles] Well, just a couple grand more, that's all. Then we're home free. [Sighs] You get the name and addresses of your folks and a clear hook up to your sister. It's downhill from there. It's-- it's just it's everything I have. I understand. But investigations cost money. Everybody has to eat, right? Look, I can only give you a thousand right now. Nuh-uh. You're just going to have to wait until I'm finished with the job I'm working on to get the rest. I got to warn you. I don't think this guy's going to come through for us until he gets full payment. I'll get it. I'll get it, OK? I got it before, right? Right. And let me know when we can get the wheels turning. We're getting real close. I can smell it. See you. [Giggles] WAITRESS: I'll be right back with that pie, angel. Jeremiah? OK, you have to stop doing this because it's getting kind of creepy the way you just pop up wherever I am. Right. I can say the same thing about you. [Sighs] JEREMIAH: You OK? Well, [sighs] I just-- I just feel like everything is like way too complicated. Like, a few days ago I had everything under control and now I don't know. All right. I'm here. I'm listening. No, I don't want to-- Oh, come on. Why not? It's me. OK. Remember the girl that I was telling you about, the daughter of the family that I'm working for? Yeah, I remember. OK, this is going to sound completely nuts. But she, uh-- she thinks that she has somehow switched bodies with another girl. And she thinks that I am really person that can figure out how to switch them back. Totally crazy, wacko, nuts. Whoo-hoo. [Laughs] You think I'm weird. I don't think you're weird. No, I-- it doesn't sound that crazy. OK, but people don't just switch bodies the way you switch the batteries in your remote. Seems like you believe at least some of it. No, I don't. I mean you can't. I mean, I-- ugh. I cannot get any more involved than I all ready am. JEREMIAH: Hmm. DANNI: Wait, where are you going? I've got to get back to work. [Phone ringing] Oh, crap. It's one of my suppliers. I-- I have to take this. Yeah, take it. I'll see you around, all right? No. No, wait. Jeremiah, I-- I need your help. I-- I don't even know how to begin figuring this whole thing out. OK, all right. Well, uh, meet me at the library, around 8 o'clock. OK? OK, thank you. All right. Get your call. See you later. Danni Hartford? Yes. No, red is fine. Uh, just as long as I can come and pick it up. OK. Thank you. Hmm. [Horses neighing] Boy, you better get moving if you think you're going to finish all the stables before school. I don't think I like our deal anymore. Oh, too bad. You don't get a choice. Well, I guess we'll see when your folks see all the chores undone. [Nervously] you-- you wouldn't even try. [Scoffs] I'm the foster kid. I got nothing to lose. Well, I think I'm going to go have a word with the parents then. BOTH: [screaming] [SHOUTING] What's wrong with you? You weren't like this yesterday! BRITNEY [AS RACHEL]: Like I said, I've got nothing to lose. Now, we can either play this nice, or we can make it war. Which way do you want to do it? Great. Let's get to work. Hi, guys. So are you going to the coffee shop after school? Actually, we were there at lunch-- --talking about you-- --and how you suddenly just turned all nerdy-girl on us. So we took a vote and-- --oops. You're out. [Nastily] So out. [Sad music playing] Don't you dare. That's my body you're treating like a garbage dump. [Scoffs] I wouldn't want you if it wasn't for your stupid friends. Fine. Let's see how you like it. When I'm done, I'm going to be fatter than a big cow. [Rock music playing] Oh. You should wear those. Why? I hate them. They're so geeky. Fine. Ruin my eyes. We can't go on like this. Well what do you want to do about it? Well, I don't know. We'll figure it out, one way or another. Come with me. [Rock music playing] [christmas music playing] OK. What's going on here? I distinctly remember telling you guys not to be seen together. Rachel the two-- Not so fast. Excuse me? We've decided-- --you don't make the rules anymore. Listen, ladies-- [FIRMLY] No! Our keeping quiet is only in your interest. Right That is so not true. All you care about is to be my mom's stupid party on the rails. I promised to help you, didn't I? But not till after the party. Then you'll just get your money and disappear. I would never do that. We've decided-- you get us back to our own bodies, or we can guarantee you can say goodbye to the career you're so worried about. Yeah. BRITNEY [AS RACHEL]: I can't go back there. I can't do it. There's nothing else we can do right now. Well, I could tell my mom. Or, um-- This is so messed up. I hate it. Look you know the state your mom is in. I don't think you can get her to hear a fire alarm going off if the house is burning down. I just wish the two of you would trust me instead of resorting to blackmail. Trust you? Trust you in doing what? What have you even done to try and get us back into our own lives? I talked to a friend. And he has a solution? No. But he believed me, and that's a start. Oh, and I bet you spent a whole 10 minutes on it, Danni. Britney, I said I would help you, and I will. Believe me, we are going to get your life back. Don't worry. One way or another, it's going to work out. OK? [ANGRILY] Easy for you to say. If it doesn't, you're just sitting there in my body with all my stuff. Do you want to know the truth? I'd give it all back in a moment. It's just stuff. Oh, yeah. Right. Ugh. I don't care about your stuff. My whole life I dreamed of having parents, and now I've got them. It's like they don't even know I exist. [SADLY] It only took you a day to see that, huh? Rachel, where were you? I forgot I had to see a friend. I thought you didn't know anybody around here. Well, I kind of met her last night. Her name's Brittney King. She's really nice. Are you kidding me? She goes to my school. She's the meanest girl there. She's not that bad. Rachel I know that you want to make friends, but you can not disappear on your own. Especially with kids like this Britney. She sounds like she's troubled. OK? Rachel, until further notice, you are grounded. [CRYING] Doesn't matter. How can things possibly get any worse? Rachel! [Door slams] DANNI: Something must have caused the switch, something magical. JEREMIAH: Oh, yeah? Or maybe it was a curse, like voodoo or a hallucination. Now, that does not make any sense. They know way too much about each other's lives for that. OK. Past life regressions. Art of soul migration. See? Some people believe this stuff. [Eerie music] DANNI: Wish fulfillment-- reportedly souls will transfer from one body to another when one of several conditions come into play. A wish from one or the other of the switched parties or both, aided by a talisman or a supernatural agent, for example, an enchanter or an angel. That has to be it. What? What has to it? - I don't know. When the girls were at the dance, they must have made wishes at the exact same moment. And then somehow their bodies switched, you know, kind of like when your cell phone's reception gets crossed with another for a minute? I see you've got this all figured out. I do. Oh my god, I remember. It was the star on the tree. It was big and silver and glittery and shiny-- It looked-- actually, it looked kind of, kind of magical. So you think that the star could be your talisman, or whatever? I don't know. But it's clear what we have to do. It is? Yeah. We have to get the star, and we have to have the girls make wishes again. And then everything's going to go back to normal. There's a small problem in that the school is closed for the holidays. Well, I guess we have no choice. We're just going to break in. [Energetic music] Don't you think this will go a bit smoother if we just ask for the star? DANNI: Yeah right. Excuse me, can we borrow the star from the top of the tree so that we can switch two girls back in their own bodies and make everything right the world. Yeah, that'll go over great. No. OK. We'll break in. Shh. [WHISPERING] Light switch. Shh. Shh. Well, There it is. [Magical sparkling sounds] KELLY KING: OK. Now this is really important. Repeat after me, party is at 8 o'clock. Uh, come on. BOTH: The party is at 8 o'clock. KELLY KING: Thank you. That wasn't so hard, was it? The guest of honor is Charles Fulton. [Sighs] BOTH: The guest of honor is Charles Fulton. Right. Now, every moment that he is in this house, we are to be focused on presenting the image of the perfect, happy family. Even if we're miserable. Thanks for your support, Jack. I'm just trying to say, will you relax? It's going to be fine. I will relax once Charles Fulton signs that paperwork, and I get my partnership. Can I go now, Mom? You know, as for you, young lady, I don't know what this change is that has come over you over the past few days, but it better not be another one of your games. It's not a game. I just wanted to be your daughter. But it seems right now you don't even really want one. Brit! [Sighs] Would you believe that? There's nothing wrong with Brittney. She misses you. I know how she feels. But, uh-- [sighs] [music playing] [sighs] Here, help me with this. You know, what if the girls can't change back? Like, The monkey's paw or something, where every time you wish for something, something else goes out of whack. So that's why people hate monkeys. I just don't want you to be disappointed. [Laughs] Jeremiah, I'm a big girl. I think-- whoa, oh! Nice catch. Thank you. [Horses neighing] So you guys came to watch me sweat. Enjoy yourselves. Rachel-- I mean, Britney-- I mean-- anyway. Listen, [chuckles] I think I might have a way to fix all this. Remember, we made a wish on the star at the Christmas dance? Yeah. Well, I got the star. And I think making another wish will change you guys right back. Are you sure? Believe it. Her friend is waiting for us at the mall. And if we get done early, I can still pick up the snowman cheese ball in time. Oh, and we really wouldn't want to miss that. Getting you back in your body is important, but I have a party to pull off. So let's just put things in perspective here, ladies. [Music playing] Hold on. I forgot I'm grounded. If the switch works, the grounding will be my problem, not yours. Right. Well then, what are we waiting for? Rachel, I'm really sorry. For what? For saying that you stole my life. You didn't ask for this any more than I did. Yeah, but I definitely got the better part of the deal. I don't know. I think you're a better daughter for them, anyway. If this return thing doesn't work, I think they'll be much happier with you. That's not true, Rach-- Britney. BRITNEY [AS RACHEL]: My mom loves her job, and I've been so mean to my dad, I don't even know why he still talks to me. Because they love you. They both love you. Yeah. [Knocking on the door] Brit, honey! [Sighs] Jack, have you seen Brit? Nope, she's not down here. She knew that she was supposed to be home by now. There are a thousand and one things left to do. Well, I can't find Danni, and she's not answering her cell. Oh my god! My party is starting in a few hours. The serving staff is going to be here at 7:00, oh my god! Shh, shh, shh. Let's go finish her shopping. The malls are closing soon. When we get back, Danni and Brit will be here. KELLY KING: I'll do my Oprah breathing. That's it. Do your Oprah breathing. Come on ladies. We don't have much time. Now, that wouldn't be the girl who got grounded, would it? Could it be? Sure looks her, though. BOTH: Busted. Oh, no. Give it to me! [Sighs] Ladies, this is Jeremiah. [Sighs] So where are we going to do this thing? Come on. BRITNEY [AS RACHEL]: Are you sure this is the best place for this? Well, at least it's private. The last time this happened on a high school dance floor. Also not the most appropriate place. She has a point. OK. Why don't we sit here. So what are we supposed to do now? Well, I figured that you guys should look at the star and then wish yourselves back. OK. Ready? [Music playing] [record scratching sound] Didn't work. What do you mean it didn't work? I'm still her. And I'm still her. Make it work. Please, help us. KELLY KING: I understand that you're busy, but nothing says Christmas like homemade gingerbread men. And the kind with the roly-poly bellies, not the ones that look like the Olsen twins. And there will be somebody there at the back door to meet you. Oh, I promise. They'll be there. Look, I gotta go. Bye. Jack, Jack, what are you-- Oh, Jack, did-- Jack! Do you want to see Santa? OK, you guys. Obviously, we're not concentrating hard enough. Remember, you really want to be back in your own bodies. I don't think you have to tell us that. [Sighs] [playful music] Are those sprinkles? Yes. Look, we need all the help we can get, so just concentrate. Britney, Danni, what are you two doing here? We, uh-- ha. We just came to get the table cloths. I thought you did that yesterday? Yes. Yes, I did. Thank you for remembering that. Just must have totally slipped my mind. [Giggles] And exactly why are you occupying Santa's Village? Uh, uh-- Rachel, what is going on here? I, uh, came to meet a friend. But you were supposed to be at home. You were grounded. I know, I'm sorry. That's not good enough, Rachel. There's nothing so important that you should lie to us. But there is. We made Christmas wishes. And I wished for a horse, and she wished for-- I wished for a family. And-- and we're trying to switch back, but it hasn't worked yet. - She's me and-- --and-- and I'm her and-- --the crazy thing is-- --we told Danni, and we all got here and-- We have to keep trying, otherwise we're going to be trapped like this forever. Girls, you're giving me a headache. Danni, do you want to tell me what is really going on here? Um, It's extremely complicated. Oh, I'm sure that it is. I'd like to hear your variation on the theme. Uh, well-- what I-- what I meant to say is, uh-- [giggles] can you believe the imaginations of these two? Pretty impressive. [Chuckles] Actually, I was just walking by and I saw Britney here with her little friend in Santa's workshop. And I just wanted to make sure that Britney got home in time for the party. So you should go home with your folks, and you should go with them. And I'm going to stay here and finish the, uh, shopping for the party. Come on Brit, it's time to go home. I wish I was going home. Britney, you were supposed to be at home over two or three hours ago. Uh, the hot items go over there. No, no, no, no, no. We said were going to put the hot items on the table there. Oh, right, right, right. Hot items over there. Oh and you can set the bar up right here, please. Thanks. Uh, uh, uh. Don't even think about it. Danni, are you sure you're OK? I'm fine. I'm fine. It's just-- It's just, you need to get your priorities straight. You're committed to helping me win the "American Daughter" account. Now is not the time to space out on me. Do something with this garnish, will you? Uh, uh, Kelly? Yeah? Do you love your daughter? Of course I do. Why do you think I do all this? Gee. Why didn't you say anything? I just couldn't. You mean you didn't want to. I guess King's right. With people like you, it's all about the career. That's not fair. I want to help you. And I will. Just after-- What if after is too late? But that's OK, isn't it? Because you'll have what you want. [Phone ringing] Hello? Danni. EDDIE DURAN [ON THE PHONE]: Meet me at the diner in 10 minutes. Um, does it have to be right now? EDDIE DURAN [ON THE PHONE]: Yes, right now. OK. I'll meet you there. [Horses neighing] Rachel, honey, um-- This isn't easy for us. Oh, and it is for me? When we signed on to foster you, we-- we didn't know that you had problems. What he's trying to say is that there are better places set up to take care of girls like you. What do you mean? We called Claudia from children's services. She's going to pick you up. Where is she going to take me? Someplace real nice. Somewhere upstate. No, they can't take me away! I mean, it's Christmas. [Shouting] Rachel! It is already set up. You should-- you should go and pack now. I'm sorry. [Music playing] Well, you can't complain about me being late this time. Miss Hartford, I, uh-- I don't know how to tell you this, but, um, my contact in records says he doesn't feel good about taking the money. Why? What do you mean? He has to help us. No, you don't understand. He doesn't want to get paid because he didn't find anything. I don't understand. What about the papers, the documents? Turns out that your mother died before you were two years old. You are the only child. And that we know for certain. But the picture? Maybe it was a kid from one of the foster homes. Maybe it was a friend from school that you forgot about. I mean, I can continue to look for the girl in the photograph, but it's not going to be your sister. I'm very sorry. DANNI: Hi. Hi. I, um, talked to the investigator, and he said that I never had a sister. Hmm. I thought that might be the case. I'm sorry. I just lived my whole life with this dream of finding my sister, and now I realize it was just a fantasy. And the worst part is that there were two real girls who needed my help, and I was not there for them when it mattered most. You know, if you told the truth, those parents never would have believed you. [Sighs] Guess I'd just be happy to go back to the night when the girls made the wishes in front of the tree. I think there's just one thing that I never understood. All three of us made wishes, but only the girls wishes came true. You sure about that? Maybe it depends on how you define getting what you want. I should probably let you get back to work. No, no, I quit. I don't work here anymore. Actually, Danni. I'm getting ready to leave again. Oh. No, you have to do something for me first. What's that? I have to go to a party, and you have to come with me. Oh, yeah? The party? [SINGING] Deck the hall with boughs of holly, fa la la la la la la la. Tis the season to be jolly, fa la la la la la la la. Follow me in merry measure, fa la la la la la la la. While I tell of Yuletide treasure, fa la la la la la la la la. Happy new year. [Sighs] Honey, honey, honey, you're going to get whiplash, careful [chuckles]. Grrr. Love your bag [giggles] Nice to see you. You have an empty hand. I will take care of that. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no no, no. This has to be on this side, see? Isn't that better? Mr. Fulton, so good to see you. Make sure that the Fultons and those right there are just plied with liquor, all the time. Honey, get that off your head. [Laughs] What are you trying to do to me? Hey, you're doing good. This party's everything you wanted it to be. I know. Fulton is having a ball. Oh, here he comes. This is for the money, be-- So I shouldn't hit on his wife? Shh, stop. Kelly, beautiful party. You have wonderful friends. They're so real, honest. I mean, the-- the type of people I see as our demographic. Hi, Jack, the husband. Oh, Jack, Charles Fulton. How are you doing? I'm so sorry. That was terribly rude of me. Charles, that's exactly how I see it, too. And to be honest, that's why I was hoping that you would see that we are perfect for the "American Daughter" campaign. And wait till you hear the speech that my daughter gives every Christmas. [Laughs] I can't wait to hear it. But as far as the campaign goes, you have to realize all the real decisions are made by the boss. KELLY KING: Oh, right. [Chuckles] MR. FULTON: I'm sure she'll love you. In fact, why don't I bring her over right now? Oh, please! Just to introduce her to you and-- Jack. Jack. She looks like an iceberg. Absolutely sure I shouldn't hit on her. Oh, you would just freeze. [Laughs] Down. [CAR SCREECHING AND SMASHING INTO SOMETHING] What are you doing? Just get down here. We need to talk, please. I can't believe it. You ruined your mom's Christmas decorations. You should see what I did to the neighbor's Toyota. Well, what is it? What's going on? They're going to send me away. We'll hide you. Where? Under the Christmas tree? I don't know what I'm going to do, Rach. I'm scared. If they send me away, we're never going to figure this whole thing out. - I know. I know. Me too. I can't believe we put all our faith into Danni. Where is she when we need her? And I believe the secret to a happy family is the orderly behavior of the children. Isn't that right? Yes, Mum. And the people who don't understand that deserve the trouble that comes to them. I so agree [chuckles]. You do? We do. Excuse me. Um, that's why I feel like I was made to spread the message behind "American Daughter." Well, speaking of children. Where is your lovely daughter? That's a very good question. [Chuckles] It's almost time for her little presentation. I'm-- I'm not-- Can I borrow her for a minute? I'll be right back. JACK KING: It's a good way to get away from those boring people anyway. I don't know where to start. Britney, who is supposed to be upstairs, is on the front lawn with Rachel, who's just driven through our Christmas decorations. All right, young lady. Do you want to tell me what's going on here? The Bradleys are going to send me away. [Sighs] I'm very sorry. But that has nothing to do with Britney and our family. But it does. We told you. We got switched into each other's bodies. Brittany, enough! As of the new year, you are going to boarding school. The one with the ugliest uniforms. Now, I want you inside this house. You have completely let me down. EVE BRADLEY: Oh! RICK BRADLEY: It's our car. What's going on here? God, not those people again. RICK BRADLEY: [ANGRILY] Young lady, you are coming with us right now. - No, I'm not. I'm staying right right here. You can not make me go anywhere. Stay warm. Merry Christmas. Happy New-- Happy Kwanza. Happy New Year. Happy Hanukkah, nice to see you. Thank you for coming. Be careful on the driveway there. It's a bit slippery. [Sighs] This is my party. And you are in my house. You can wait here until I have straightened this out. Oh, and make-- make sure she answers to what she did to my-- my car. All right you two. You have got about 10 seconds to explain what you are up to here! [Interposing voices] MR. FULTON: Excuse me? [Interposing voices] MR. FULTON: Kelly? [Interposing voices] MR. FULTON: Excuse me? I'm sorry. I don't mean to interrupt. [Chuckles] I just came back for my gloves, cashmere, brown, I thought-- Now, is this the young lady I've been hearing so much about this evening? Um-- Uh-- uh-- this-- this girl? This is Britney. This is her daughter. [Laughs] Well-- And she's a terrible influence. She's gotten our foster daughter into all sorts of trouble. And now she stolen a car and run away from home. BRITNEY [AS RACHEL]: Cool. KELLY KING: I asked you to wait outside. It's gotten so bad that lately Rachel doesn't even seem like herself. Kelly, this isn't what I was expecting out of the evening. But Mrs-- DANNI: [SHOUTING] No, wait! Hold on! Who's this? That's Danni, our party planner. Where have you been? I've been uh-- You know what? That doesn't really matter. What matters is that the girls-- well, the girls are telling the truth. MR. FULTON: Excuse me? DANNI: I know it sounds like way too extraordinary to believe, but, um, the girls have somehow found a way to, uh, switch bodies and uh-- KELLY KING: [ANGRILY] Oh, we've hired a drug addict! Drugs? Kelly, if you took the time to notice, you'd see the change yourself. What are you saying? Kelly, do you think it's possible that you've been spending so much time trying to make a perfect family for everyone else that you've missed the family right in front of you? Stop it! I know my own daughter. No, you don't. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys. Dad, I'm sorry I didn't get you a present last Father's Day, even after you just bought me a new vintage dress without Mom knowing. And I'm sorry I didn't appreciate you taking that job that you hated just to keep supporting us. All I cared about was, who was going to pay my next allowance, and that was gross of me. And Mom, I'm sorry I failed math, even after you got me a tutor. He wasn't cute, so I just didn't go. And I'm sorry I charged your credit card for Prada bags and shoes. What shoes? I guess you'll find out when the bill comes. Oh my god, I'm actually starting to believe them. I know this sounds crazy. Let me tell you, it feels totally crazy. But if I'm going to be stuck in a poor foster kids body for the rest of my life, no offense, I want you both to know that I love you. Kelly, I'm afraid all of this really isn't helping your pitch for my business. Hey, Mrs. Fulton, I am done pitching. You can give me the account or not. But it's Christmas time. And last I heard, that's supposed to be about family and, as screwed up as we may all be, that is who I'm going to spend it with-- [laughs] --my family. Charles, we're leaving. [Clears throat] I have been hearing about your speech all evening. And I have to say that it truly exceeded all my expectations. If nothing else young lady, you have a great future as a writer. Kelly, all families have problems, uh, yours perhaps a trifle more unique than most. BOTH: [laughing] And I have a-- a bit more influence on that account than-- than I may have indicated earlier this evening, so let's talk Monday morning. Sure. Thank you so much. Eeeee! BOTH: [laughing] Danni, what can we do? Let me try something. You already tried this. All three of us made wishes before. But when we tried to straighten them out, only the two of you tried to wash yourselves back. I didn't bother trying. I guess I didn't really think my wish mattered. So you think we'll need to do it together? [Sighs] I think it's worth a shot. Let's see if all three of us can get what we want this time. OK, concentrate, ladies. [Magical twinkling sounds] [loud wooshing sound] Oh my god, I'm back. Ha, me too. Mom, Dad, I'm back. It's really me. Oh, I've missed you, baby. But I think it was really me that wasn't here. I'm sorry. Rachel, we have to go. It's time to say goodbye your friend. Mom, Dad, Rachel's my best friend ever. Please, don't let them take her. JACK KING: Hun, what can we do? There's regulations and there's procedures-- I-- I'd like to try taking care of Rachel. Really? CLAUDIA: I'm sorry. This is not how things are done. Honestly, I can do this. I have a job. Do I still have a job? Of course. And I think we would make a really great team. I think we already have. There'll be tons of paperwork, but I think we can make it work. BOTH: [laughing]. JACK KING: You see, now this is something you don't see every Christmas. People on their way to being reasonably, cautiously happy. BOTH GIRLS: [giggling]. Jeremiah? Jeremiah? You're leaving, aren't you? Yeah I'm leaving. It wasn't an accident that we ran into each other, was it? No. I just need to know why-- why you didn't come back when you were done overseas. When I was away, I was delivering some food to a village. And the plane I was in crashed. Oh my god. I'm sorry, I-- I didn't know. Were you hurt? I mean, you're so lucky. You could have been-- you even-- you could have di-- No. Shh, hey. No. Hey, come on. Shh. It's not so bad, really. I got one of my wishes. What did you wish for? I just wanted to see you happy. And that's exactly what I got. [WHISPERING] You take care of yourself. Merry Christmas, Jeremiah. RACHEL: [SHOUTING] Danni! Come back and celebrate with us! [Music - "santa baby"] Badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom, badoom. [Laughter] Badoom, badoom, badoom [music playing]
