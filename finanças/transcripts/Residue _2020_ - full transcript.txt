Yeah, in about a week. Hey, man. Did I ever say goodbye when I left? I mean, when we was leaving… moving. I mean, I don't know. I remember when y'all left, though. What you remember? I remember we all rode our bikes to y'all new house. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah, nigga, you don't remember that? Not really. Who was with us? It was me, you, Demetrius, Ceecee, Jacob. It was all of us. Damn, that's wild. You got a good ass memory, man. Yeah, I remember because I couldn't believe how big y'all house was. Y'all house was big as shit. That's wild man, it's crazy you remember that. Yeah, man, everybody remember that. Y'all house was the cornerstone, son. Mrs. Vonnie, Mr. Reggie, everybody felt that. Anyway, what's up with the film? It's coming together, you know, I got some good stuff to write. I'ma write it when I get back to L.A. Yeah, I seen you going house to house, getting information. Yeah. You know I been thinking about doing something, writing a movie or a book or something. Oh, for real? -Just an idea. -Yeah? What's it about? -Nothing too much, man. -Come on, man. You not gonna tell me? Come on. Alright. It's about this boy who live in a warzone, and he had this brother, they was real tight. The boy end up leaving, going to do his own thing, while the brother had to stay home in the warzone, take care of the family, put food on the table, make sure everybody's straight. The brother that's gone don't know what's going on, he living it up. The other brother gotta take care of them responsibilities. The brother that's gone, he comes back home, it's still a warzone, but now it's a jungle. He thinking everything's sweet in this jungle. His own family don't give a shit about him. And they know that he don't give a shit about them. 'Cuz he left. No matter what he say, no matter what he do, they see right through his transparent ass. But, hey. It's just an idea. Little movie or something I been thinking about doing. I don't know if I'ma do it for real. Just an idea. But, hey, I ain't gonna hold you, I know you got shit packed. You be safe, man. [Delonte] Have fun out in Cali too. [Ms. Cooke echoing] That boy got some demons. He seen his own momma get shot. Right there, right there where you're sitting. His momma was messing around on his daddy and she got pregnant by another man. And his father knew it. So he promised her he would take her life. And he told her: "I'll do it in front of your whole family." I tell you, I never seen nothing like that in my life. Coming so heavy on her. He was so crazy. Just the idea that she had another man, and he had a lot of women, a lot of women. That's what's wrong with Delonte. Delonte suffered so much. [gunshot] No! [Ms. Cooke echoing] He talked all this mess about her, but he was just as bad, he was worse. Both of them, both of them was out there on them drugs. He said he would killed all of us. [Ms. Cooke] Call the police, call the police, baby. Go, hurry up! [door opening] [Ms. Cooke] That what's wrong with Delonte. [screaming] [rambling] Who's that? [panting] [screaming] Who's that? Who's that? Who's that? Who's that? Are you okay? Damn! What's wrong with you?
