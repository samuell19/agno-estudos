- Okay. - Oh, wow, this is nice. Well here it is. Last one on the line. It's not as big as the last one but it's a very nice house. Mm-hmm. As you can see, there's a nice open kitchen that joins the dining room. Yeah. There's also a living room, slash, sitting room over there. - Okay. - Yeah. - Follow me and I'll show you. - Like it? Exposed wood is really attractive, I think. What kind of wood is that? Pine. Whoa, this is a nice room. Oh, and it has this exposed brick right here. That is really nice. I always wanted exposed brick. Oh, look at this view. Wow. Oh wow, that is a nice view. Yeah, you like that? It's pretty magnificent. - Wow. - Yeah. Yeah, I could get used to this. Would be nice to take a walk down there sometime. Look around for yourselves. Okay. Oh yeah, just like you said. Very cozy room. Look at this, honey. - Yeah, I've noticed. - The table. Antique. Oh, this is pretty. Oh, that's a local artist. Art doesn't come with the house. But some of the furniture does. Like the couch and the wooden table. What'd down here? What's down where, sweetie? Oh, there's a finished basement downstairs, William, if you wanna check it out. There are two bedrooms and a half bath upstairs. Come on, I'll show you. Dad, I'll be downstairs. Don't touch anything that looks like it can break. Of course, Mom! Yay, I'm on TV! The dropdown ceiling was put in place for minimizing sound. Contain heat during the winter, keep it cooler in the summer. Wood paneling makes this a finished basement. It's really cozy. Of all the homes we've seen, I think this might be the most realistic, honey. I know, I mean, I really like it. Oh, how long has it been on the market? Well why don't we go upstairs and talk? Sounds like you're interested. - Yeah, yeah, okay. - Okay, I'll be right back. Mommy? Yes, honey? I'm cold. You are? Well, you know what, I figured you might be. Look what I got for you. All right, you wanna go take a nap over on that couch? Are you tired? Look, I know it's been such a long day and you've been so good. But we're gonna go talk about some boring stuff upstairs. But if you continue to be good, we'll stop and get some ice cream. Okay, I'll be good. Okay, I love you honey. We'll be right upstairs if you need anything. Wait! Yeah? A little more open. Little more closed. Perfect. Okay, sweetie, go take a nap. I'm so glad you like the house. It's perfect for a nice vacation getaway. And that's what the previous owners used it for. It's close enough to everything on our list, honey. Yeah. Well, the house has been on the market awhile now. So you're lucky, the price reflects that. Yes. Now I wanted you guys to see it first before you made any, well, make any decisions based on the history of the house. If you're serious about buying, I do have an obligation to tell you a little bit about what happened here. It's nothing, really. It's nothing that should detour you in any way and the price, well, it's a steal at this point, and the savings? Yeah. Well, you can use that for renovating if you want. Yes. Or longer vacations. The sunlight's beautiful in the morning. East is? That window faces east. It's a nice little house. So, the instance. There was an unfortunate accident that happened in the house awhile back involving a child. The owner's son just turned 10, he was having his birthday here, so, of course, there were other children celebrating as parties go. I think I heard something about this awhile ago but I just guess I never really thought it was true. When the story gets told so many times, of course, things get distorted. But the fact is there was a death here. Paper dubbed it as a terrible accident. That's exactly what it was. He must've been playing with a rope with the other kids and he just... Tom, one of the guests, hung himself. Oh, that's terrible. How does he just hang himself? How does a child do that by accident? Little boys get into mischief. It's horrible. Ugh. He did have a mental disability. He was autistic and perhaps not knowing what he was doing. Some say he was being tormented by another child but I think they were just playing around with a rope and somehow Tom got himself tangled up. We all get tempted and do stupid things when we're young, I suppose. So where did this happen? Things happen, of course, but it shouldn't be anything to worry about and shouldn't be a factor, I mean, the price. Sorry to be freaked out, I just... Where exactly did this happen? In the house. In the basement. Jim, can you go check on William? Baby, he's fine. Okay, I'll go. Okay. I'll be right back. Excuse me. Hey, buddy, where are you? William? William? So, your parents told me a little about you, of course, and about your condition. At least in general. Yes, yes, my condition. Basically, I don't remember a small part of my childhood and I was institutionalized for awhile. Did they tell you that? Not that you were institutionalized. Of course not. It's the family secret, they don't like to talk about it. My parents say I was out of it for about a month. Completely unresponsive. Didn't know what to do, so they had me institutionalized. They kept me in there for another year and a half just to make sure I was okay. It must've been tough. My parents aren't the best at dealing with major issues, so they pay other people to do it for them. No, I just don't remember being in Vermont at all. And it was for a very important birthday. Well, why was it so important? I wanted to see what that house was all about and why my parents kept leaving me to go up there. So I decided to have my 10th birthday up in Vermont. Did they still own that house? Oh yeah. They should just sell it because they never go there anymore. It just sits there being maintained for no reason. I've been under hypnosis but nothing's every come up. It's just a lost time for me. No one knows why. Well, dissociative amnesia can be caused by many things. It occurs when a person blocks out certain information due to a traumatic event. I'm your case, a small gap. Now, our subconscious has one way to retrace certain lost paths. I'm not surprised you were ever under hypnosis. But you said it didn't unveil anything. Which means that those memories are locked in a very deep vault. My parents said I used to get nightmares as a kid. Really, really bad nightmares turned into night terrors. I'd wake up in the middle of the night screaming. I'd be afraid of this monster that would crossover from my dream into reality. Being an only child, I'm sure, can be hard. I'm not a child anymore. Yes, of course. Do you want children of your own? Not really sure what that has to do with me having amnesia. Well, usually amnesia is the result of an injury to the head. Your memories still do exist and could resurface after being triggered by someone or by your surroundings. Someone did reach out to me recently from Vermont who apparently knew me. Thought maybe I'd go up and see. Well that's great. Maybe this person can help jog your memory. Who is this person? That's what I wanna find out. Through social media but I don't know what she looks like. Never seen her face. I thought everyone took selfie's. Apparently not. That's what makes her so interesting. Well this could be good for you. Yeah. Maybe. I love it. Well, it's certainly small. Not bad though. It's beautiful. Simple and perfect. I'm so excited. This is a pretty big moment. So? Does it look familiar? I've seen pictures of the place. Oh, right. But, I mean, being here, are you remembering anything? Doesn't really work like that. Sorry. Wait. What? What is it? I'm remembering. I'm remembering! Oh my God, you're so stupid. Oh baby, I'm so excited. This is such an amazing thing that we're doing together. I know. Hey, Claire, did you hear something? Awesome. I can't believe you're here. Did you get my notes? Oh my God. It's you. Who else would it be? What the hell are you doing here? I'm so confused right now. I was bored so I wanted to swing by. My girlfriend, she's upstairs. I see you got one of your masks on. I'm not ready for you to see my face yet. I'm very shy. I've never seen your face, not even on your profile. You're like this... total mystery. You came all the way up here without seeing my face? I was curious. Anybody can be found nowadays. You are just as weird as I thought you'd be. Is that a compliment? No, not really. So, you don't remember me? We met once. Do you remember? It was at your party. What party? Your birthday party. No, I don't remember that. That's one of the reasons I'm up here. Oh, to have an other birthday party? What? You're crazy. Some farmer kick bitch who hides her face. Soon, so soon. The full moon knows the truth. We'll dance under the wind while our souls are cremated with lies and goodbyes. How'd you get in here? I have a key. What key? You speak so much. Does you girlfriend let you speak so much? My girlfriend does whatever I tell her to. Mmmm, I bet. Spoiled little rich boy from the big city. Do you recognize me? You said we only ever met once. You know I don't remember. How do you not remember me? This is getting old. God, you're hot though. You mean for a hick. Yeah. I can't believe you're here. What the hell did I get myself into? So you're really not coming? What're you talking about? You're not going jogging? Um, no. I'm kidding but I really think you should. You know, make you feel good. I'm content with this and this view. All right. Where are you gonna go? I don't know. Exploring somewhere. Cool. Okay then. Well, I'll be back and maybe we'll do something later. Sounds perfect. All right. - See ya. - Bye. Garrett, are you still here? Garrett, what're you doing? Shit. Garrett? Hey, I'm back! Hey. Mind if I take a piss? Go for it. How was your run? Awesome. Kicked a very steep hill's ass. Oh, cool. Maybe I'll go with you next time. Listen, Garrett, I don't wanna sound paranoid or anything but I thought I heard... What the hell? What? You nearly burned my face off! God, you're over reacting. Garrett, you dick, it really got me. Why would you do that? I'm sorry. Seriously, warn me next time. All right, all right. - Come on in. - Come on in. - Oh, it's you! - Oh. Thank you so much for coming to Garrett's birthday party. We really appreciate it. Oh, well thank you for having us. It's always so great to see you when you come up. And I finally get to meet your son. Yes, Garrett insisted on having his birthday up here this year. So, it's a little different for us but I think he really loves it up here. Well, I guess our little Vermont hideaway has been found out. I hear that. He must be very excited to see Vermont. What did you do with him all those other times, if you don't mind me asking? I may take it as advice and try to do it with my kids. Well, we just feel it's important to put our relationship first and then our son, so when we come up here throughout the year, we would have a nanny for Garrett or we'd enroll him in a sleep away camp. - Builds character. - Mm-hmm. Also, we spend a lot of time with him, so we just thought it was important to have time for ourselves. Oh, alone time can be very important. But I don't think my little Devon would let me get away with that for too long. Hello, Garrett, happy birthday! This is Devon. Did you bring me a present? Oh, hey Garrett, why don't you take Devon and go play in the other room? Okay? Oh okay, come on, Devon. Oh, I'm confused. I thought we weren't supposed to bring any... - Oh, no, no, no, no. - No, it's totally okay. Garrett is very picky, so we asked parents not to bring presents just so he wouldn't throw a temper tantrum. It's better this way. Oh. Yeah, so, we bought a bunch of gifts for each kid to give instead to keep the peace. Each child will have one gift to give Garrett, so it's all taken care of. We just thought this would be easier for everyone. I would've brought something if I... Oh, no, no, no. It's totally okay. We also didn't wanna - impose on anyone. - Yeah. So, we're taking care of it. Look. Oh, wow. See? Easy peasy. Here, you can give him that one. Okay then. - Okay. - Great. - Oh, hey. - Oh, here they are. Hi. Oh, it is so nice to see you. Hey. What you doing? Hey. Nothing. The art in your parents' house is so peaceful. Yeah. Is that in Vermont? Yeah. It's Harvey's Lake. I saw signs for it on the drive up. We could go there if you want. Okay. But you need to shower first. Or I could just go like this because it's Vermont and nobody cares about body odor. I think not. All right, all right. It's so beautiful out here. It's like one of those paintings at the house. Yeah, it is. Could never live here though. It's too slow moving. I like city life. I could. New York is different but, you know, sometimes the city life gets to you. You're always on the go and out here it's more simple. That it is. So you're happy you're here with me? Of course I am. I'm always happy to be with you. In fact, I would like to spend more time with you. That's what we're doing right now, aren't we? My lease is up in two months. Oh. Oh boy. - What? - Here we go again. It's true. I know it's true. You've told me before. And then there's that other time you told me and the other time. We've been going out for almost two years. Time flies for sure. Well, hopefully when you're having fun. How long have you been planning this trip? Hmmm, a little bit. I'm having a great time. Good. I mean, with you. I could just be anywhere with you. What? Nothing, you just sound a little bit like a greeting card. What do you mean? You say really cheesy things sometimes. Excuse me? I could be just about anywhere with you. Look, Garrett, I love you and I know it's not easy for you to express your emotions but you don't have to be such a dick. Hey. I wasn't trying to be a dick. Yeah, well you could've fooled me. Claire? Hey. Hmmm. Before you trip is through, my love and hate will eat you. Your soul will slowly fade away. But down below you'll forever stay. Claire, Claire. You're talking in your sleep. Garrett, there's something in this house. What're you talking about? I couldn't breath. I couldn't breath, I was having a nightmare. Okay, come here. It's okay. Just try and go back to sleep, all right? I hate having nightmares. Hmmm. Hi, sexy. Hey. I don't have my period anymore. That's awesome. I gotta go to the bathroom. Hey, I'm gonna go downstairs and watch TV. Garrett? Garrett! What the fuck, Garrett? You fucking asshole! Come on, I had to do it. You scared the hell out of me. Oh, come on, I'm sor... You are so mean. I'm sorry. Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here. Don't ever do that again. All right. All right. Do you mind if we get out of the house for a little bit and just maybe go walk around town or something? Yeah, sure. Oh man, the homes around here are so cool. I once had a friend who had a coffee table book of all Victorian homes. - Yeah. - Always loved it. Yeah, they don't make them like this anymore. How many people do you think live around here? I don't know. Oh, look at these. What's that? Dollhouses. And wind chime. Oh yeah. Mask up there. It's kinda scary. I love this one. Hey, where are you going? Just give me a minute. Okay. Garrett. Slow down. Garrett. Hold on. Wow, look at that. - Pick me, pick me, pick me! - Pick me, pick me! Me, me, me! - Me, me, me, me! - Me next, me next! Me! Me! What is it? It's a one thousand piece puzzle. I think it's cool that you wanna have your birthday up here. Yeah, why haven't we seen you up here before? I live in New York. So, will you be going to school up here? Why would I? New York has the best schools. My turn! My turn! My turn! My, my turn! My turn! My turn! My turn! My turn! My turn! My turn! Okay, okay! Tom, come up here. That's my balloon. It's red, my favorite color in the whole world. I like that. I want one. A truck? That's my favorite truck. I wrapped myself. Yeah, I can see that. Okay, Tom, you can sit down now. Okay, Tom, sit down. Jennifer, is your brother deaf or something? He's not deaf. Come sit back down, Tom. You did good. I gave Garrett my favorite truck. Can I have that? No. That's mine! It's my balloon! There are like a million other balloons but this one's mine! It's my birthday and this is my balloon! Tom, come sit back down. I gave Garrett my favorite truck. Yes, I know and it's perfect. Perfect? It has rust on it, it's far from perfect. Come on, Garrett, chill out a bit. He was just being nice. This is my special day! You're all here to celebrate my special day, so be grateful! I could've spent my time in New York City! Sit back down, Tom! You're crowding my personal space! I gave Garrett my favorite truck. I gave Garrett my favorite truck. My truck. Tom claps his hands. He sits in the sand. He listens to a rock n' roll band. Tom claps his hands. He sits in the sand. He listens to a rock n' roll... B-b-band. That's great, Tom, you're so good. Tom claps his hands. He sits in the sand. He listens to a rock n' roll band. Tom claps his hands. He sits in the sand. He listens to a rock n' roll band. Tom claps his hands. He sits in the sand. He listens to a rock n' roll band. Oh, what'd you find? Pretty cool, isn't it? You gonna buy it? I don't know yet. Haven't decided. Maybe. Oh, you're like a little boy with his truck. Yeah. Good evening. Hey, how're you doing? We need to rent some shoes. And what sizes? 10 and a half and... Six and a half. You look familiar. I get that a lot. What's your name? Garrett. Hmmm. I live in New York, so I doubt we know each other. We're here on vacation. I've always wanted to go to New York but I've never been. You should go, it's great but we love it up her. It's just so beautiful and peaceful. Beautiful and peaceful? Yeah. I guess you could say that. So that's 10 and a half and six and a half. Coming right up. Here you go. You're in lane 13. Lane 13, so mean. Last breath under dark trees of green. What? Lane 13. Just walk over there. That guy was weird. Nah. Everyone's strange. Okay. Well, I'm gonna go find a bathroom. I'll be right back. All right. Do you mind if I sit down for a second? Sure. Thank you. I didn't mean to eavesdrop but I heard you're not from around here. No, I live in New York City. We're just up visiting. How do you like it up here? It's quiet, for sure. Well, you'll learn to love it. People always do. Oh. I don't mean to pry but was that your girlfriend? Yeah, she is. You're a lucky man. Yeah, I guess. She can be a little bit clingy sometimes. It's actually been getting worse. I'm actually starting to have my doubts about her. At first I was excited to come up here but deep down, I feel like I want something different. I'm not really sure how much longer our relationship's gonna last. Please do not say anything. A man should always keep his options open. Right. That's what I thought. How do you think she'll take it? Ugh, she will be upset for sure. Very upset. I don't know, she might even... Commit suicide? Uh. She is unstable. And that weakness, I can't stand it, it's like she's trying to suffocate me. Always dropping hints and all I'm trying to do is just relax. She ruins so many moments for me. Do you mind if I give you some advice? No. I observed her when you walked in and right from the start, I didn't get a good feeling about her. I hope you don't mind my saying so. No, I think this is something I need to hear. She seems like she's of the type who'll say anything to keep you happy. But as a deeper ulterior motive that's entirely self-serving. She's not stupid but I bet she plays dumb. All the time. You wouldn't believe some of the stuff that comes out of her mouth. It's a trap. She looks appealing but once you really look, I mean, really look closely at that sweet innocent act, you'll see she's just lying to get what she wants. Yeah, everything with her, it's about the next step in our relationship and it is stressful as hell. I mean, I'm thinking maybe I should just cut her loose so I can finally enjoy myself. I have to constantly worry about what's going on with her. Well if she gets a whiff of you realizing her game, there's no telling what she'll do. Women can be very cunning. Yeah, they can. Well, it's sure been nice chatting with you, Garrett. I hope we can do it again. Sometime before you leave for New York. Yeah. Thanks for the advice. So, how many games do you wanna play? What's wrong? Nothing. I'm starting to get this unsettling feeling. Here you go. Look at that sky. It's so beautiful up here. Can you do me a huge favor? Yeah. The whole time we've been up here you've been saying the same shit. It's so beautiful up here, it's so peaceful. I didn't mean to. Do you have any idea how annoying it is for me to listen to you go on and on about how beautiful everything is? I am trying to do some actual work up here. This isn't some goddamn game for me. I'm trying to remember a part of my childhood and all I hear is you talking about how beautiful everything is. I mean, could you see how that would drive a man a little crazy? Garrett. I swear I didn't mean to prevent you from remembering anything. It's just, we've never really been anywhere together. It's a nice change. And, I mean, come on, look at how beautiful it is. You see, there you... fucking go again! It's so beautiful, it's so beautiful. How am I supposed to concentrate when you are so easily impressed? I mean, you act like you've never even been outside before. Do you have any idea about what kind of an idiot you come across ass? I mean, who the fuck are you? Who gives you the right to say all that shit anyway? I'm, I didn't realize that... I just didn't realize. You are so dumb, Claire, because you have no idea how you come across. You call me stupid? You joke around, you call me an idiot? But you are stupid, Claire. You are really, really stupid. Garrett, why are you saying this? I don't understand why you're being so mean. Because you're stupid! I am gonna go downstairs and I'm gonna watch some TV. Hey. Sorry. Fuck this. It's beautiful, so what? Who the fuck cares? She's so trying to drive me crazy! I'm not crazy. She can not make me do anything that I don't wanna do! I don't even know why I brought her up here. Gah! Oh, it's so beautiful up here. It's so peaceful, it's so nice. How many fucking times did you say that, Claire? How many times are you gonna tell me the same thing over and over again? I can't take this shit anymore! God, get it out. Garrett? Garrett? Garrett, is that you? Garrett? Garrett, I'm so sorry. I know that I say stupid things and I do dumb stuff and it can be really annoying. I didn't mean to make you angry. And I understand why you're so upset and I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. Garrett, I feel like I'm losing my mind. I keep hearing things and I don't know what's going on and I just feel like I'm going crazy and I don't mean to make you mad, I just... I wanna go out. I wanna go to a bar and I'm gonna have a beer. When I get back, things will be different. That's good. Yeah, you should go to a bar. You should have a great time. I can make dinner for us when you get back. I can make spaghetti. I love it up here. It's a place I can see myself living for the rest of my life. Yes. I love it up here too, Garrett. Garrett! What'll it be, stranger? I'll have the IPA. You wanna start a tab? Yeah, sure. Do you have darts? Yeah. There you go. Bullseye. Hello, Garrett. I'll have another IPA. What's your drink? Always whiskey. You can always tell a lot about a man from what he drinks. Here's to the graves of children. This place up here... feels like home. Just wish I came up here by myself. I try to be a good boyfriend but what's that ever really gotten me? Bowl of spaghetti waiting for me? Don't you have options? Actually, I met someone. She reached out to me. She wrote me a note. Most girls don't write notes anymore. The paper has her scent on it. I can smell her like she's in the room with me. A woman's scent can be a very powerful thing. Hmmm. What do you think Claire will do when she hears of Jennifer? She'll be unhappy, that's for sure. How unhappy? Very unhappy. She might do something drastic. She might even try to hurt herself. Or worse. Can you really trust her at this present moment? Women scorned can do very dangerous things. I would not take this lightly. No, no, I don't. Women can be very crafty. Very crafty indeed. She's always been crafty. I don't mean to step out of bounds, here, but... Do you fear for your safety? What do you mean? You know exactly what I mean. She's a nasty little bitch. Are you sure she can be trusted? She's probably putting something in my food. She's always tricking me and going on and on about her nightmares. Trying to make me think things. Trying to put things in my head. Very crafty. She's planting the seed. After everything I've done for her. Wait! We're sorry, the number you have reached... We're sorry, the number you have reached... Please type the number or try your call again. Try your call again. Just calm down. It's all in your head. Watch some TV. He wasn't watching TV. Garrett? Garrett, are you down here? Garrett? What're you doing? Oh, you're so easy. Do you know how easy it was for me to fuck you? Do you know how easy it was for me to lie to you? When you were with your family in Rome, I fucked a girl in your bed. Oh. The thought of you in Rome while I was fucking in your bed was such a turn on. It was a friend of yours, no less, what was her name? Beatrice! Beatrice. That slut was at your birthday party the very next month and it was funny because it was our little secret. Hmmm. Oh, I hate this commercial! I like this show though. Bob, what do you get when you scare the shit out of your girlfriend? I don't know, Billy, but she better run. I think you better listen to Bob. One Mississippi, two Mississippi. Three Mississippi! Garrett, please. Why are you doing this? I just wanna go home. No! No! The lion always gets the elk. Don't worry, I'll put you where no one will find you. Just let go. I thought you were bringing me up here to propose. Wait. Claire. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, what? What? Claire, what did you say? What did you say? What'd you say? I thought you were gonna ask me to marry you. You'd be so much happier if you just let me kill you. Come on, come on, come on! Come on! Jennifer! I can smell your perfume! I'm on my way, where are you? What took you so long? I was just about to leave. I had to take care of something. I'm free now. I got here as quick as I could. Are you ready? Definitely. It's weird seeing you here after all these years. Is it strange for you too? I wouldn't know. I don't remember. Do you remember Tom? You were 10 years old and so was he. He lived in a small house with his parents. They didn't make much but they always had a lot. Tom wasn't like the other kids. He was slower than the other kids, mentally. Where is he now? Why all this talk when all you wanna do is fuck me? My thoughts exactly. Do you think of me? I think about you all the time. Does your girlfriend take you into the woods and do nasty things? Does she fulfill your desires like I'm about to? Who? You know, the female you lied to. That you continue to lie to. Oh, does she make your toes curl like I'm about to? I'm ready. Why aren't you really excited for me, Garrett? Really turned on. I want you to let go. Allow me to take control! I know it's not like you to lose control but I need you to for me. Or this exchange, it isn't going to work for me. Yes. Yeah? Yeah. You like being choked? No air, can't breathe? Yes. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. No, no, you have to let me do this to you! You have to give yourself to me or your orgasm won't be as strong. Yes. Yes. Yes. Feel my power, Garrett. Let yourself free. You're such a good boy. You want this, don't you? His life cut short. How dare you not know who Tom was. Has it been that long? Okay, let's try again. Three, two, one, go! Have you seen Tom? No but I think he went inside. What's with you? All Tom had to do was take a present from my parents and give it to me. They always get me what I want. Where's Tom? I can't find him. Come on, hit the ball! Tom! Found you. Tom? Tom? Somebody help me! Garrett! Garrett, what happened? Garrett, what happened? Psst, Tom. Tom. Tom. Help me! Go! Go! Go! Balloon, balloon! Yeah. Thanks for inviting me, Garrett. Can I have that? Follow me, Tom, you can have it. But you're gonna have to trust me. Do you trust me, Tom? Yes, Garrett, I trust you. Good. Now, do you want this balloon? Yes, yes. Are you sure? Yes, Garrett, yeah. Okay. You'll have to grab it then. There's only one way to catch a red balloon. See that stool? Uh-huh. Walk on it. Okay, great, you're doing great, Tom. Now, this may seem a little odd, but you're gonna have to trust me. Hold on to that rope and slip it over your neck. I don't wanna. Well, Tom, you have to if you want the red balloon. You want the balloon, right? Yes, yes. That's great, Tom. Now reach for the red balloon. Don't worry about falling because the rope will catch you. See, I'm here to help you, Tom. I want you to have the red balloon but you're gonna have to reach for it. Okay. Almost. Almost. My family fell apart because of his death in your house! Tom was my brother. Don't you remember? I know it was you! I know it was you! Aw. Don't worry. We'll hide the body so nobody finds you. Oh my God. I'm so pissed at him. He's so stupid. Yeah, I can never wear that in public again. And I heard that other girl was pissed. Hang on, Amy. Hey. Doug. Where'd you get that? What? The balloon. A man gave it to me. Yeah. Right. What man? He said you should get off the phone when babysitting me. Whatever, Doug. He also said you should stop sleeping with married men because one of the wives is gonna find out and kill you. He said you deserved much worse. What man? Who said that? Who are you talking about? Where'd you get this? Bye-bye, balloon. You shouldn't have done that! He said you were gonna do that but I didn't believe him. You shouldn't have done that! What time is it? - It's 2:13. - What time is it? What time is it? - It's 2:13! - What time is it? It is 2:13! Stop! You'll never be happy again. Doug! Doug! No! No! No! Oh my God! Somebody help!
