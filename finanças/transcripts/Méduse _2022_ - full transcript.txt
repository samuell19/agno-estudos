Well, I'm leaving. Good... It's necessary, let me go. I do not have a long time, okay? Kiss, see you later. - Roman? It's Simon. We're having a drink tonight for Corinne's maternity leave. I hope that you will be there. It's at 7 p.m. - Post deleted. - Tomorrow, I will leave early. I have to visit the house that you like. I dunno. Serge didn't tell me. Someone important, I believe. All right, are you done? Come on, get up. See you tomorrow. See you tonight. How are you? Oh, but that's great. Well, no, I didn't get your message. You're serious? It's been three weeks that I negotiate. Call me back, maternity leave. It was he who took it. Well, you had to call me. Yeah, listen, we'll talk about it on Monday. Good night. -Oh no ! This girl was not clear. Anybody would have done that. - You're saying nonsense. -No. Guillaume, what would you have done? - Uh, I would have slept with her. - You see, you see? But it sure is. - I would have accompanied her, but not slept with her. - Lies! - You are incredible! - Because if you had been unemployed... - It's a super cool home. - Thank you, but it's at my grandmother's. She is in a retirement home, so I run the house. - Yes. - Wow! - Come on. - See you tonight. And try to walk a little. - I take the last one? - No, I only ate three. - What are you eating? When we look at you, it doesn't look like you eat that much. Oh, no not that! - Ouch! Aren't you from here? - No, I'm from Corsica. - How long has it been? What happened to you there? -Four years, in December. Are you from the area? -No. We were in Saint-Maurice, with my dad. After the death of my mother, we settled in the south to get closer to my grandmother. He often left abroad and she kept me. - How old were you when your mother died? - I was 14 years old. We had a car accident. I got nothing, but my mother was dead on the spot. - I'm sorry. - She was driving. -And your father ? What was he doing? - So, that's a mystery. - Recount. - I never really knew. I know he... He was doing business and it was dangerous. He was disappearing for months. He was coming back with gifts or else he sent large sums of money to my grandmother. I just learned not to ask questions. - Maybe you're the daughter of a drug dealer. - And you, where did you live? - In Brando. Do you know Corsica? -No. - No? - Why does that make you laugh? It's very beautiful, Corsica. - You said it with the Corsican accent. - You make fun of Corsicans? - No. - It's a nice little village. We lived in a little house, a bit like here. - You want to visit? - Uh... We're going right now. - Come on. -No, No! - Roman? - Hm? - Roman? There is a girl in the living room. - Ah yeah, it's Clemence. - Where does she come from? - It's my sister. - Your sister? - She lives here. - You didn't tell me that you had a sister. Where was she yesterday? - In the room. - What ? - She had a stroke after the car accident that I told you about. And in fact, she can't talk and she finds it difficult to move. - Are you ashamed of her? - No. We are together. - Well, I'm going to leave. Nice to have met you. - I'll take you home. Sorry to have lied to you. See you again soon ? Deal on your own, for once. Do you want more? No! Hold on. I'll go. - What is this thing ? There is nothing to eat here. So ! You will have to put some effort there. A bit tough. We spare you everything here, in fact. What are you going to do today? And you, do you want to drink anything? - Actually, she can't. With the drugs, she can't drink alcohol. - Look, she's very pale. Go ahead, pour him a drink. - OK. Take it. How was your day ? - I've only seen ugly things. - It happens often? - She is jealous. - What ? - Look, she's jealous. - Stop it, you're not nice. - She was making a face while we were kissing. - Put yourself in her place. - That's what I do. I think I am the first person to take an interest in your sister for a long time, right? Come, Clemence. Don't be afraid, I will not eat you. Come on. Come on. Hey there! I think your sister should meet a guy. - Ah good, You think ? - All girls her age dream of meeting someone, No? - I don't see her as a girl about his age. Sometimes I pray for that to change. - You pray? - Yes. - You believe in God ? - Bah, I don't know. In doubt... - Go ahead, pray. - Right here, right now ? -So that your sister will meet someone. - No. - Right here, right now. - No, not now ! - What do you have to lose? - It's ridiculous ! - No way ! He can hear that very well, right? - Who ? - Oh, God. - It's a beautiful bouquet, do you think? Stop. - It's classy here! Is it a Bernard Arnault or what? - I present to you Romane and Clemence. - Hey nice to meet you. Leonardo. You know about Vivi? - It's been 10 months. She left for Christmas. Boom, in the mouth. So, for six months, I didn't want to see her anymore. She put the kid in the garden. I was waiting, when the car was leaving, the little one was coming home. I took it upon myself, see? I did not return his bullshit, his shit and all. - I did not know it was so serious. - Her boyfriend looks like a postman with the look of a shitty dog. Sausage ? I pass him, I grab him and... I knock out his teeth. Motherfucker. No, but it's true. - Come on... Let's toast to this evening. - Salud. Do you drink Coke? - She dumped me for two months after I did. - Yes, you told us about it already. - Where are you going? - What ? Stop it, you're not nice. - Oh, I'm good ! She is touchy! - It's you who aren't nice! - You're happy, huh? - Oh dear ! - Flo... Uh, Clemence. - "Florence"! - Watch out, wait... -"Clemency". -Look how pretty she is. It's crazy. You're super hot, Clemence. - I didn't have any desserts. - And you know what ? I think you're super pretty, Clémence. It was nothing. You see, I understand what you're saying. Say something, I'll understand. Go ahead. Uh... You like... You are... very happy... to speak easy With me. You see, I understand everything. And you, when was the last time you were in love? Oh yes. The first time... The last time... that you fell in love... it was... You had, you had... A year. 12 months? Oh yeah, not much more. That was before... your accident. - She seems to like it. - Hmm. I don't know, anyway he appreciates it. He is not bad, he has spirit. They look good together. - Do you think he has a mind? - Yeah, don't you agree? - Actually, I like you really super strong. It's true, huh, I find you super hot. And tell me something. Do you have something else to tell me? For example, do you love me a little? - Are you resenting me? - Hmm! Not enough to drink this evening, all the same. - Hush. Come on, let's have a drink. - To the most beautiful woman in the world. - Oh ! - Uh... - I'll go ! - Hi, it's William. I can't come here for two days. No, no, it's good. I'll be back on Saturday, okay? How nice. Thanks you too. How are you ? I do not regret kicking his ass, this asshole. - No. - I was sure of it. You can talk. Go ahead, try again. Ah! Not bad. Mh! - Hm-hm... Hm-hm... Oh... Hmm... Oh... - Awesome. Ah! - Ah Oh... - Talk to me. It's too early, right? Yeah. - Hmm... Oh... - Ah! - Oh... - Hmm... - Hmm... - Who is that? You ? Christmas from hell. Well, with two boys! Who is it ? A lover ? Her boyfriend at the time? No, I'm not jealous, no way. With a cousin? A cousin ? And then, how old were you? Eight years? - Hm-hm. - Me, at eight years old, I wanted to be a firefighter, already. And you, what did you want to do? - Photographer? - Oh... - You wanted to be E.T.? - No ! - I think you succeeded. It's true, you're all alone in the House, I teach you to speak and you have blue eyes. There are three points in common. Ouch! Ouch! Go ahead, go ahead, I dare you! Come on ! Oh, no not that ! I will fart on your cane! How are you ? - Clemence, can you laugh? - I spent a day completely useless, if I had known that my sister had found the voice... It's incredible. I don't even know anymore what to say. Ah yes, Saturday the 12th, it's the last game of the season. With the girls, we're having a house party. - In fact, can you talk? Can you say something? Well come on! - She can just laugh there, actually. Yes, you make sounds, it's true. - Sounds ? - Sounds. - Oh... - Yeah. - Hmm... - Yeah. Just go. - Hmm... - Yeah, again. - Hmm... Oh... - It's crazy, isn't it? - Hmm... - Yeah. - Oh... - Oh... - Awesome. - The weather is stormy. - Hmm... - Anyone want some cheese? - It's not bad, is it? - Good night. - Where are you going, sweetheart? - I am tired. - Good night ! How are you ? - Yeah, very well. - You're sure ? - Yeah. - What did it do to you to hear Clemence? - It was strange. - And? - I dunno. If I knew I would tell you. - Well, you have to tell me. I tell you everything. It should be the same for you. - Well, it's not the same for me. - Well why? - Because I love you more than you love me. - It does not bother me. I find it cool, even. - Oh... Stop moving. Clemency. - Slept well ? - Yes. Ah! - Clemency! - Oh ! - You are boring, there. Oh no ! Slut... But if we pick up... Oh ! - It is useless. - No, the housekeeper arrives soon. - If the maid arrives... Who wants a coffee? - Carry on, Clemence. - A tea ? - Yes. Clemence, shall we continue? Come on, we're done. It's impossible. No, it's impossible ! It's dark, it's disgusting ! And I have to make you come every time! No, it's not easy, I'm sorry ! four hundred ninety seven 00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:42,280 I'm not a professional. I don't care! I'm sorry. Of course I am, I'm motivated. - Roman? Roman? Go ahead. Like this, like this, like this. Ready? Not bad. Roman? Roman? What did he want? - Nothing, he's a jerk. I'd rather not talk about, it's going to piss me off. - Have you seen Clémence's progress? - Hmm. - I'm sure I'll get there. - The doctors said that there was little chance to regain her autonomy. Don't be disappointed. - Don't worry. Tomorrow and the day after, I work at night. I will stay here and take care of her. - Don't say anything. If you work at night, you can't take care of her during the day. You need to rest. - Don't worry. There you go. Yeah ! Attention. Come on, come on. Come on ! Tomorrow we start again. 8 AM. Tick, tock, tock. Are you ready ? How are you, sweetheart ? - Mh. - You are very quiet. How was your day ? - I sold the dump. - Oh ! You must be super relieved, right? Good... I'm leaving. I have to go to work. You're going to miss me ? It's okay, I know. Come on. Tomorrow at 8 a.m., huh? In front of your bedroom door. Check. - You're sure ? I'll come to help you. Good night. - What is happening ? - Excuse me. - Why are you coming here like this? - I wanted to surprise you. - A suprise ? - Excuse me, my love. I'm sorry. I am really sorry. - I want you to take me very far from here. - Can we leave tomorrow? - Honey, are you serious? - You don't love me enough, do you? - I love you like I've never loved someone after 3 weeks. It's only been 3 weeks. - It may be rushed, right? You live in this big house... - I do not like it, this house. - And your sister ? - I'm not going to be with her all my life. - No, of course. - You have to find someone for her. - I will do it. I assure you. It just takes a little longer than expected. - Do you find me ridiculous? - No. No way. Please don't cry. - Of course. And Clemence? - She doesn't want to come. I already asked her. - OK. You have to take me. We'll go where you want anywhere, but we have to go. - I am leaving. You can't do this to me. You can't leave me here. Do not leave me.

Someone's knocking at the door. Clemency! Go open it! - Good morning. Roman Mancini, is here ? Hello Francois André, SOS Doctors. - Hello, doctor. - Arterial pressure, beats, okay. We're going to remove all of that. Who did this to you? It's you ? All right... let me see this injury. Oh yes, okay. Yeah, sorry. That's OK. It is not serious. You need to rest 2, 3 days, If you are in great pain, you will need a scan but in my opinion, it's not necessary. So come see. Good, it's good. If you have anything, if you feel bad, do not hesitate to call us, but there you go... - Thank you, Doctor. - Have a nice day, please. Bye. "Clemence, I'm leaving.

I didn't disturb you ? - No way. - I'm coming to get my blood pressure monitor. I must have forgotten it. You saw it? - I have not paid attention. It must be in my room. - I'll be two minutes. It's good, I found it. - You want a coffee ? - No, that's okay. - You don't bother me. Sit down. Have you been a doctor long? - 6 months. I graduated in Paris and I just arrived in the region. - Oh, you're not from here? - No no. I have been here for 2 weeks. I get lost on the roads. I don't know the shortcuts. Have you lived here long? - It's at my grandmother's house. - Is she no longer there? - She's in a nursing home. - All right. And you both live here? - Yes. With my sister. - You have a beautiful house. -THANKS. 01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:32,680 {subs by Shivarising}
