[Kya] How many times are you going to keep calling me? Unless you're calling to confirm first-class, three rooms and a driver, he's not showing up to your heathenistic poor man's Coachella. No, no, no. No, don't take it personal. I'm his publicist, sweetie. That's my job. He's on the verge of becoming a goddamn star. - Who? - [loud crash] [gasps softly] Listen, I don't care if Aoki, Harris, and Garrix are circle jerking to the best next dance song since the Macarena. If you want my client, put up or piss the fuck off. Always want the most for the least. I mean, same. But that's what I get paid for. [sniffs] - [loud crash] - [cell phone rings] I swear to God. Hi, Colton. I thought you were someone else. I'm sorry. [chuckles] Yes, I did everything you asked me to do. No, I don't know. This place is a fucking trashcan. Just tell me where the cash is, so I can dip the fuck out of here. Fantastic. Thanks. [sighs] Shit. [sighs] Oh! Oh, fuck. Oh, Kya, you deceitful little minx. Eh? Bitches got to eat. [loud crash] [distant indistinct chatter] Hey, you can't be back here. This is for professionals only. Fans think they can do whatever they want, whenever they want. You self-deserving little shits. Whatever, I'm fucking out of here. [screaming] [metallic clang] [yelps and cries] No! [crying] No! [grunting] [head clangs] Fuck. Oh, fuck. [crying] [screaming] [growling] - [Pierce] Yes. - [Jake chuckling] [Jake] Even if she makes it out, she's fucked. Come on, she's literally 10 minutes away from an infection. Jake, it's horror. Seventy years of genre tropes tell us that gore porn is not about logic, it's about the squirm factor. Okay, remember when we were 8 and I fell off my bike? Remember, you wouldn't help me up because the skin was... - [Chuckling] Oh! Yeah. - ...hanging off my knee. Yeah, yeah. You left me at the playground. The playground where that homeless bag lady used to quote old episodes of "Murder She Wrote." [laughing] Look, now you watch this shit like it's SpongeBob. Well, it practically is. It's not real. [Jake] It's real enough. Oh, my God, you are an actual limp dick. Is there anything else you're still holding a grudge about? Eat me. [laughing] I'm being serious. So we're about to be 22 next month. If you've got any repressed prepubescent confessions, I need to know. It's best-friend privilege. - You're ridiculous and awful. - Isn't that why you adore me? - [microwave beeps] - Here, you want some Skittles? I had all the green ones, but you hate them anyway, so you're welcome. I give you once more your freedom. I give you life. Boo! [Pierce laughing] Not now. We're done. I don't want to watch this anymore. No, dude, you promised me, a Halloween movie Fridays for entire month of October. [cell phone chimes] [Jake] Your phone's getting more action than my sister after she went on birth control. I really don't want to talk to him. He's like three cups of boyfriend material too many. Uh, how so? How so? He's like overly communicative, and emotionally available, and always wants to be with me. Just not what a real relationship should be. Sounds a bit like me and our friendship. Is that not real either? Oh, yeah, but we're not sleeping together. Well, I hate to break it to you, but sleeping with someone doesn't make a relationship real either. Can I just be 21? Can I just be completely incapable of emotional commitment to internalized self-loathing? - A lot of big words. - A lot of big words. You know, I don't know what I want. Maybe I'm just having, like, an emotional midlife crisis. It's that sociopathic floodgate breaking. - [chuckling] - Yeah. You're becoming who you really you are. You are going to be last to die on my shit list. How's that for real friendship? - Ooh! - Hmm? [chuckling] [knock on door] Can you get it? [knocking on door] Nice, Jake. [both scream] - [Brecken chuckling] - Oh, I'm sorry. That was a little harsh. Probably should've given you a heads up, huh? [laughing] [Pierce] Ivy, is that you? You're actually such a puss. [both chuckling] - [Pierce] Hi. - Oh, my God. - Oh, hi. - Hi. You must be Brecken. That's me. Nice to meet you. Thought you guys weren't supposed to be here till tomorrow. - Surprise! - Surprise. - [both chuckle] - Oh, wait. Oh, no. Did I ruin the consummation of years and years of friendship? Nope. Just watching some horror movies. Oh, God, you guys are so boring. I blame you, Jake. - Oh. - I'm kidding. - Nice to see you, too, Ivy. - Oh, come on. How was the flight? You know, ouch. [imitates gunshot] I feel like I haven't seen you in decades. It's been three years, huh? Yeah, it has. [chuckling] Oh, I missed you so much. I missed you, too. - So you want to...? - Yeah. Yeah, let's do it. Hey. So uh, what's the deal there? Friends. Friends is the deal. Cool. Cool. Same. Yes. Me and Pierce, I mean. - Yeah? Oh. - Yeah. [Pierce] Oh, my God! - Are you fucking kidding me? - No. - [Jake] What? What? What is it? - [gasps] Ivy, I can't believe you did this! Did what? Not helping. We are going out tonight. [laughs] Where? To the sordid realm of... Take a deep breath, because shit is about to get crazy. - Cataclysm! - Cataclysm! Dude, how did you do this? Tickets sold out like the same day. Well, I know your birthday isn't for another few weeks, but I figured, since I'm going to be here anyway, we could celebrate early. That is awesome! Wow, okay. Judging by the name, I'm going to guess it's something anti-Jake? No, no, you're going. It is a 10-hour party with six different EDM artists, and I hear that lewd acts and cocaine are encouraged. - [laughs] - Yeah, no. It sounds like a breeding ground for an STI. I'm going to sit this one out. You... You got plenty of friends, Pierce. I didn't want to have to do this, but remember high school freshman year? Beaver first, questions later, Trisha? - You got chlamydia. - Wait, why are you doing this? I covered for your ass and told the nurse I need a Z-Pack for a lady-part staph infection. [both] Whoa. [Pierce] You never paid me back for that. I don't feel like being sandwiched between wasted white girls wearing ill-fitted neon leggings and flower crowns. Oh, come on, you would be so lucky. I get enough of that on Instagram, okay? A bunch of millennial sheep heading to the slaughter. Honey, I am an excellent shepherd. Just not a good sister. I'm kidding. Also, these tickets were really fucking expensive and I have crippling med school debts, so maybe you could put a pin in your anxiety for just one night. I will let you off the hook for Halloween movie Fridays. Uh... I'm going to regret this. [all laugh] - [knock on door] - [Raye] Hunter, hello? ♪ Baby, let's go We can live like the radio ♪ [laughs] ♪ All of these stars They can fill up stadiums ♪ ♪ Baby, I know We can live like the radio ♪ ♪ And all of these stars They can fill up stadiums ♪ [grunts] God, you're so strong. Have you been working out? - Shut up. - [chuckles] [cell phone chimes] Are you kidding me? Hunter? Mm. Un-fucking-believable. [dance music blaring] [sighs] This place is like an adult Disneyland. - [Jake] Whoa. - [Ivy laughs] That's what I was afraid of. Okay, let's get drinks. Shots on me. - I'm okay, actually. - [Pierce] Okay, lies. You've been drinking since you were 14. She always could outdrink her exes. I bet. Well, I am turning over a new leaf. Med school has been very illuminating. Okay, well, can you maybe turn this leaf over after... Are you pregnant? Yeah. No! No, I am not. Seriously, Pierce, come on. - Oh, my God. - [chuckling] Okay, Brecken? No? - Sorry. - Jake? Dude, drinking alone makes me an alcoholic. No, drinking excessively makes you an alcoholic. - Go. - [Pierce] Are you kidding me? - Off you go, come on. - Yeah, come on, kids. [Ivy] Yes, get out of here. We'll wait for you. You guys are freakishly similar. [knock on door] [Zeke] Your set starts at 12:45. You need anything? Water, vodka, MacBook charger? [Dylan] How much are you getting paid? [Zeke] Excuse me? I'm just curious why you felt entitled to mock someone who could get you fired. It was a joke, actually. [sighs] [laughs] Fuck. I'm fucking with you. Come on, lighten up. Hey, if you happen to see my agent or my publicist, can you send them this way? They were meant to be here hours ago. Of course. Hey, so do those...? Do those actually work to capture dreams? They're apotropaic. Protective magic. Wards against evil, misfortune. The webbing's based on spiderwebs stemming from Asibikaashi, the spider grandmother. My great-grandfather was Ojibwe. Wow, you are next level. [chuckling] Thought it was kind of like a gimmick. Yeah, most people do. The beautiful thing ,about heritage is I'm not obligated to explain it. You a fan of EDM? Yeah, yeah. Actually... It's actually the reason why that I took the gig. My favorite was your show in Sedona last year. The show where those two teams off themselves. Yeah, the pagan blood ritual or something, right? Dude, it was kooky shit, man. But you know, I kind of loved it. Never mind. So, dude, how'd you get your big break? [sighs and clears throat] Are you familiar with Faust? - No. - Hm. He sold his soul to the devil in exchange for success, knowledge, worldly pleasure. At 20, I did the same thing. Yeah, why do you think I carry around protection? You know, my passion. My... My drive. It comes from knowing I'm two steps from hell. Oh, my God, yes. [dance music playing] Disneyland, yeah. This is like a high school dance on speed. Yeah, well, you never really went to a high school dance, so... You spent prom night gorging on Arby's and watching "The Little Mermaid." And I will not apologize for that. - Thank you. - [laughing] You should. Just... You know what? I have an idea. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Just once. Okay, there you go. Relax. - Just feel the bass. - [dance music throbbing] Yeah, you feel it a little bit? Okay, good. It's more than just the music, it's.... It's like a spiritual experience. Okay, there you go. Okay, limp dick. There you go. No fucking way. I know you. Aren't you supposed to be DJ Dream Catcher? Are you worried about getting mobbed out here? I'm just another face in a room full of strangers. Why do you think I always wear a mask? Pierce? Pierce? - I like your outfit. - Thank you. My sister let me borrow it. Oh, is she here? Oh, is that your move? That's what you do? Scope out the crowd early, and charm a girl or two for a little drunken fun later? Presumptuous. Are you always this judgmental? Yeah. I mean, uh, no. I'm guarded. Huh. I'm Pierce. - I'm... - I know. ...Dylan. [dance music blaring] - Have you seen Pierce? - Seriously? - [Pierce laughs] - Oh! Where did you go? Wow, Jesus, you're lucky this was free. I met a boy in line. He seduced me into a dark corner and ravished me to the sound of hard, pulsing drumbeats. [laughs] Gross. I'm joking. Well, kind of. I did meet a boy in line. Not just any boy. One of the headlining DJs. Okay, what did he say? Just, you know, the usual groupie filter questions. His number. - Stop. - [laughs] Yes. He's really sweet, and he's humble, and he invited me back to his room before the set, and offered us VIP seats during. I mean, you're smarter than that. I don't really feel like stroking your ego when he breaks your heart after he gets his way, so go have fun. Wow. Thank you. Good to know you think I'm such a slut, Jake. Anyone else want to shame me while he's at it? Shame you? I'm being protective. You know, what friends do. - This isn't the first time you... - Fuck you, Jake. You don't know what you're talking about. Okay, Pierce, he didn't mean anything by it. - Don't go off the deep end. - Wow! Good to know my own sister won't even defend me either. Great. Here we go. You want to chime in, too? No? Okay, well, you know what? I'm going to go. I'm going to go get some air and pamper my vagina, get ready for a pounding, because apparently that's the kind of person I am. [Ivy] Wait. Come on, we just got here! [sighing] [chuckling] [Hunter] Pierce? Oh, this can't be real. Have you upgraded to stalking me now? That's not stalking, it's binge research. - Hm. - I thought you were into that. Isn't "Psycho" your favorite movie? Wow, such a hard person to see these days. What a coincidence. Hm. Hi. Have I seen you before? I don't think so. I mean, you look like you go to Target, so maybe there. - Maybe there. - [Raye] Okay, makes sense. I'm Raye. - Like a gun? - [Raye] No. Like the sun. Did you and Hunter go to college together? You went to college? Wait, now I remember. You said you did two semesters of Phoenix online, right? - Hm. - Yeah. We met on a dating app. Ah, looks like that didn't work out. Well, I guess that depends who you ask. I was looking for friends and fucks, you know? Too buried under all my law school applications to worry about romance. - Future Cochran here. - [Raye] Where are you applying? I'm actually in my final semester now. You know, I'm already building a client list and actively participate in cases. That is truly fascinating. It was so great meeting you. So great running into you. Listen, Pierce. [Ivy] Defensive and reactionary have always been Pierce's go-to. She's been going through a lot lately. She's convinced she's having a quarter-life crisis. Yeah, babe, it's a quarter-life crisis that's been going on since she was five years old. [sighs] I know you're dense, but this is textbook narcissism, Hunter. Law school applications? I guess toiling away at Trader Joe's, working on your romance novel is not sexy enough for you. Sexy? Okay, do not turn this around. You ambush me here with Ruth Bader Ginsbitch in, what, hopes that I'll be jealous and leap into your arms? You made me split the check with you on our first date, but you'll spend 150 bucks to stalk me here. - [sighing] - It was sex. No commitment. I'm not someone you want to get involved with anyway. - Trust me. - Look, it wasn't just sex, even though it was good sex. It was real connection. It was real conversation. - [drunken laughter] - Jesus Christ. Being smitten sucks. Imagine being Raye. ...you go to a rave and you think you're someone's date, and then they fucking leave you for another bitch. - That's tough. - Yeah. Imagine being you. You must think I'm a complete idiot, or maybe it's just you. I'm magna cum laude, second to none, not your fucking accessory. Okay, yet here we are. You're disgusting. How about a gift? I can get a picture with someone that's going to rake in followers, likes and comments. - Good night, Hunter. - Okay. I'll have him tag you. I know how much your image means to you competing with Yulia, who trips to wherever the fuck. You see, I listen. We get this picture and then we're leaving. Leaving, and having a serious conversation about whatever is happening between us. [dance music blaring] [song] ♪ Rise and shine ♪ Hey. Not now. I'll meet you on the floor. Pierce, for the love of God, please don't do this. Come on, Pierce, let's go. Whoa, stop. You're going to randomly pop back into my life after three fucking years, Ivy, then you can stand beside or step aside. Pierce, I just want us to have a good time. Look, I... I did this for you. - Look, what Jake said... - I'm going to go. If I'm not back in 45 minutes, I'm upstairs, third door on the right. Classic. Un-fucking-believable. [door creaks open] Dylan? Hello? Anyone? [sighing] This was a mistake. Shocker. [loud crash] Hi. Oh, that was creepy. [both laugh] You're really not helping ease my he-might-be-a-serial-killer mindset. I'm sorry. I just had to deal with some live stuff. Do you want a drink? [dance music playing] Oh, look, I am on another fucking mountain. Oh, my God, the water is, like, so blue. Hashtag "Everglades of realness, bitches." [loud knocking] Your incessant photos can really suck my dick, Julia. [loud knocking] [Raye] Someone's obviously in here. [loud knocking continuous] [sighs] Just a minute. Oh, yes, nice makeup. Want to do a little finger banging in there? Gross. What you popping? Want us to pop something else? We don't have to talk. Hey, wait up. [Dylan] Okay, so your life's in shambles. We've all been there. You know, I was at rock-bottom, but I pulled myself back up. You've heard of spirit quests, right? Sometimes, they can show you your soul mate. These kind of look like roofies to me. It's... It's mescaline. A derivative of peyote. It'll take you out of your own body for a bit, give you an insight, an understanding. Just enough time for you to cut me open and sell my organs on the black market. Please. I have plenty of money without having to get my hands dirty. It's an offering, not a demand. I'll leave it to you. [dance music playing] Close your eyes. It's like a spiritual experience. [Jake] Oh, my gosh, what is it? [Pierce] Fuck you, Jake. You don't know what you're talking about. [Brecken] You good? You good? Okay, cool. All right. - Oops. - [both chuckle] I thought you knew where his room was. Fuck this. I'm surprised you're coherent, lady. What are you on, drink 14? Trust me. - Okay, you want to go first? - Sure. [Dylan] Breathe. Now, feel yourself leaving your own body. Leaving what was. This is a husk. [no audio] You did this! Goddamn it, Pierce, it's been an hour and a half. Come on, let's go find her. [Ivy] Confused gutter slut. [Brecken] Useless cock tease. Stupid, immature, broken whore. [Ivy] You will always be my weak little sister. [Jake] Toxic bitch. Pierce. Pierce, come back to me. Hey, follow my voice. [breathing heavily] [no audio] [screaming] [Brecken] Hey. Pierce? Pierce, will you let us in. [Pierce screaming] [Ivy] You will always be... [Jake] Selfish, toxic bitch. - [screaming] - Pierce? Will you please... Pierce! - [Brecken] Stupid. - [Jake] Whore. - [Ivy] You gutter slut. - [Pierce] Kill yourself. No! [screaming and indistinct shouting] [Ivy crying] What the fuck did you give her? What the fuck did you do? What the fuck did you do? [Brecken] Hey, Ivy. [sobbing] God! [crying] No. - [Ivy] What did he give you? - [Brecken] It's gonna be okay. - [Ivy crying] - [door opens] [Josephine] What did I tell you about bringing fans backstage? Who the fuck are you? I'm Josephine Tully. I'm Dylan's right hand, and his left hand. His mind, his heart. I'm his everything. I had cameras installed in this room. So if you leak anything, I will release a doctored video that will ruin your lives. So here's the deal. We will get rid of the body and you will walk away with a big fat compensation check. I'm a lawyer. You're not going to get away with this. Hold on, Erin Brockovich. We're not going to trial. We're going to settle here, now. Dylan, get up. Come on, you got to focus. You have a set in 30 minutes. Tomorrow, we have the big release party. Shit happens. [Brecken] You can't be serious. You're just going to go down there and pretend like none of this happened? [Josephine] Pretty much. See, there's me, and there's Dylan, and there's his manager, and then there's all the other people that I can buy with motherfucking money. I can twist this however I want. [chuckling] W-W-We won't be bullied by your industry tactics. [Josephine] I'm not a bully, sweetie. I'm compassionate. Being rich, you see, you never have to bully. You should get your costume on, go downstairs. Dylan, go. [Josephine] How is... 50k apiece? That do the trick? Cash. No check bullshit. [Josephine chuckles] [Josephine] Sensible. See? I like this one. Fine. Hm. So how about you come to the release party tomorrow, and I will bring your cash, unmarked bills. If you don't want it, you don't have to take it. But if any of you are going to be the martyr for the cause, trust me, oh, that will backfire. I have ruined more lives... [chuckles] ...than Mitch McConnell. You're a goddamn monster. [Josephine] Hm. No. I'm worse. I'm an agent. [dance music blaring] That's the address. Party starts at 10:00. Be there at 9:30 for business. And keep your mouth shut. She wasn't kidding about Mitch McConnell. [Jake sighs] [Jake] Oh, my God. Oh, my God, we can't go through with this! We can't. We don't have a lot of options. Who... Who even are you? You fucking sellout, man! - Hey, guy... - Fuck you, dude! - You fucking sellout! - Hey. Guys, guys, this is not the fucking time! Shit. I forgot my clutch on the couch. Fuck. [Hunter] You really want to go back in there? No, but I do need my phone, wallet, and keys, otherwise I'll be sleeping on the street tonight. Wait, wait, wait. You're not going to stay with me tonight? You really are that guy, huh? I'll call you tomorrow. I will come up with something, okay? We will take them down, but we're doing it in the correct legal way. [sniffles] I'm just getting my fucking phone. [sobbing] [Hunter] I'm really sorry for your loss. [sobbing] It's all right. [Ivy crying] [crowd cheering] [knocks] Shit. [breathing heavily] Take a hint, jerk. I'm not looking to rave with you, so just fuck off. [blade unsheathes] [gasps] [screaming] Help! Somebody open the door! Help! [crying] Please, what do you want? I don't have anything! Please! Please, please, no! Ah! Please, no! [screams] [dance music throbbing] I saw Ivy's arm. Not exactly subtle. Why didn't she call Pierce? You saw how they were together. [sniffles] It's... It's not my place, okay? [Jake, chuckling] Oh, right. Right, that excuse. [Brecken sighing] Ivy and I were in an on-campus support group together. At the time, we both had body dysmorphia and anxiety-turned-depression. We held each other's hands when pain got too heavy. [pills rattle] Oh, we laughed, we cried... we learned. [sniffles] Ivy made me feel safe. She made everyone feel safe. And then one night, she... She stopped responding to my text and my calls, and... I knew. I fucking knew what was happening. [sobs] She needed me, and I was paralyzed. I was helpless, because I was terrified that maybe this is what she really wanted. Maybe it was her only way. [Jake] Pierce wasn't like that. She had pain, yeah. But... But not like that. No one has the power to measure someone's pain. It's one of the flaws of humanity. We can look for it, we can assume, but we can never know for sure. Stop, okay? Don't... Don't project Ivy onto Pierce. [sobbing] It's not fair and it's not true. Listen to me. I spent most of my childhood deflecting, okay? It didn't make anything better. It was... It made me feel good for a second, but it didn't change a fucking thing. So, I'm sorry, Jake. I'm... Fuck. [sighs] [voices whispering] [voices whispering] [breathing heavily] Get it together, get it together, get it together, get it together, get it together, get it together, get it together. Get it together. Get it together. [indistinct whispering] [growling] Get it together, get it together. Fuck this. Fuck this. You bitch! Fucking stop! [grunting] Fuck! [panting] [Ivy] Before med school, Pierce and I used to go on a camping trip every fall. [sniffling] It was a sister retreat. Somewhere new each time. And no matter how much time we spent together, we never got tired of each other. I still don't know where it all went wrong. [sniffles] I don't want to break again, but I can feel it. [sniffles] I can feel the fracturing beneath my skin. I keep playing it over and over again in my mind. Her eyes. We've got to be strong. You've got to be strong. I don't want to be strong. I want to be angry. This isn't fucking support group, Brecken. Being strong is not going to do anything. Yeah, well, neither is being vengeful. We're not going to take their money, but we can't go in there guns blazing like a fucking Tarantino movie. We are better than that, Ivy. We're going to use that lawyer girl and... we'll find a real solution. Yeah. Come on. [sighs] [sniffles] I can't believe she's gone. [Josephine] No, I haven't heard from her. [Josephine sighing] Yes, I left the envelope where you told me to. Well, you know, Kya. [chuckles] She got paid, so she's probably juggling three martinis and three men. As long as she gets the article prepped and ready. Yeah. [loud thump] Uh-huh. Honestly? [scoffs] He's really shaken up. More so than with previous incidents. Mm-hmm. Right. I mean it's suicide. It's not a thunderstorm. It's not exactly predictable. [beeps] [loud thumping] Hello? Josephine? [loud crash] [loud crashing] [Josephine] And what'd you do with the body? [sighing] Great. [Dylan] Josephine? Just a second. Listen, if we're doing this, we have to do it tomorrow. [Josephine chuckles] No, bring your gun. Well, you know, how our little Dream Catcher can be when he gets angry. Yeah. Okay, bye. [inhales deeply] Dylan. I thought you were steaming. I was, until you came up and tried to dick around with me. I've been on the phone. It's just your imagination. You're tired, you're emotional. But that crowd, oh! [laughs] You... you outshined everyone. What did you do with Pierce? And that DJ Trek. You know, he's good. Do you know who reps him? Jo, I don't think inviting her friends over tomorrow night for the event is a good idea. Oh. It is not your job to think. Your job is to drop beats, spin music and make the world believe your life is nothing but a panty-dropping party. Don't you remember when you couldn't book a club, not a wedding, not a low-rent birthday party with fake Disney princesses? I did that. - I created you. - You're wrong. I created myself. Then why am I cleaning up all your messes? You're cocky, you're sloppy, and you're lucky that you keep checks coming in. Don't challenge my decisions. I could end you just as fast as I created you. Who were you on the phone to? And why would they need to bring a gun? I was on the phone with your manager, making sure everything from tonight had been taken care of. [sighs] And the gun? Well, this is America. [chuckles] More trigger-happy than ISIS. And it is my job to ensure your protection. Now, get some sleep. Tomorrow is a very big night. [sighing] Hey. Hey. - You okay? - [sniffles] No. Do you want me to call someone? It's not like that. You can talk to me. "Life is but a walking shadow... "a poor player who struts and frets "his hour upon the stage, "and is heard no more. "It's a tale told by an idiot... "full of sound and fury, signifying nothing." That makes no sense to me. [chuckles] It's from "Macbeth." Oh. [sniffles] Pierce and I were both in high school. I was a senior and she was a freshman. She wanted to be Lady Macbeth so bad, but I got the part. She played a witch. And she took it so, so seriously. Her room was filled with books on the occult and demonology. She laughed at all the other kids that thought that Harry Potter was real magic. [chuckles] - [loud crash] - [gasps] What was that? [door creaking open] You think it's coming from the foyer? [objects crash] Well, I'll follow your lead, because I'm the endearing friend. I'm bound to die first. [whispers] Would you be quiet? - [ice machine whirs] - [gasps] Oh, shit. Anything? Hello? Who says, "hello"? Shut up. Just shut up. Shut up. - [sighs] - God. [loud roar] [indistinct whispering] Ah! Dude! Oh, my God, you scared the shit out of me. I nearly hit you in the face. Overreacting again. Jesus Christ, Jake, where have you been? Was that you the whole time? I couldn't sleep. - I went for a run... - Sit down. ...and I tripped into some bushes. [Jake gasps] - I thought you were asthmatic. - [Jake grunts] That's why I tripped. Lungs got the best of me. Nice working that out. Okay, let me just get you some water. [sighs] [Jake exhaling sharply] How did you get glass in your shoulder? That's bad. Thank you. Yeah, I... I told you I tripped. Into some glass bushes? You're such a fucking comedian. I don't know. I... I wasn't... I wasn't checking the debris. Jesus, get off my fucking back. You know what? I'm going to go shower. Hey, let me clean up your cuts first. I'm good, but thank you. I'm glad med school's paying off. Your conscience is clear now. - [door closes] - God. [sighs] ♪ I don't sleep Like I used to ♪ ♪ Counting sheep Doesn't bring you... ♪ Mm-mm. Take it in the house. ♪ The seven drinks In the green room... ♪ Drinking already? [Josephine chuckles] Don't act surprised. You know, I like to stay perpetually buzzed. Today has been a day, and it's only 12:00. Flat tire, conference call. Everybody sounded exactly the same. And I got blood in my fucking trunk that won't wash out. I just paid $18 for salmon on a bagel. Was it life-changing salmon? - From the salmon's perspective. - [Josephine chuckles] You're buying me new trunk carpet. [Josephine] When we're done, just buy a new car, or two, or lose your Audi for a Chevy and get 12. [Colton] I still haven't heard from Kya. What if she went solo or tried to take us over? Then she'd be a publicist. Kya's got skin in the game. She hates Dylan just as much as we do, and this whole thing was her idea in the first place. If she doesn't publish the article tonight, we'll know she's out and we will handle accordingly. Did you get the video I sent? Yeah. And it's recut. Along with the footage from the other festivals. Switzerland, Brussels, Manchester, and EDC from last year. [woman, on video] Can you help me? Can you take me home? This is great. [woman] This doesn't feel right. - This isn't okay. - So what's happening with our potential new clients? Four new artists ready to sign by next weekend. - Huh. - They want to see Dream Catcher fizzle out as well. Phew. Hmm, greed is a beautiful motivator... Colton. And they say managers are just wet blankets who can't handle confrontation. [chuckles] Ooh, I am impressed. Hm. You're still going to pay those kids from last night? Over the dead girl? [laughing] No, of course not. No, I have a contingency plan, and it is one they will never see coming. Mm, can you talk to the AV guys? I need to make sure that video plays on cue. You know, technology is shit. [sighs] Can I get a second to talk to Dylan? [Josephine] He's asleep. Thanks. [Dylan sighing] [sighs] Look alive, Dylan. [inhaling and exhaling] Look alive. [turns on water] [sighs] [dialing] [Kya, over answering machine] It's Kya, you know what to do. Kya, it's Colton, again. What's the deal? This is over a million dollars on the line. Call me. [phone beeps off] Hey, uh, AV guy? [door slams shut] [jiggles doorknob] Fuck. - [electricity crackling] - [film projector whirring] Dylan, stop dicking around, man. [film projector whirring] [grunts] Oh! [grunts] [Brecken] Where's Jake? Another run into the bushes? Um, I don't know. I haven't seen him since noon. Sent a text saying he'd meet us there. [sighs] How was your nap? Six hours isn't a nap. It's a coma. Are you sure you want to do this? I'm going to get justice for Pierce any way that I can. American legal system justice, right? Sure. Ivy... I'm not a dog, so don't treat me like a bitch. What do you think, I'm hoarding a machete in my purse? All I'm saying is if I get blood splattered on these shoes, I'm going to be pissed. Let's go. I don't want Jake there alone. I would like to keep eyes on both you wild cards at all times, okay? Yeah. Okay. [bodyguard] Name, please? Uh, Victoria, and Jack. Boss, I apologize. I don't see those names on the list. Don't I know you? Robito? Oh, yeah. Jack, you're Dylan's cousin. Man! I'm sorry, man. Good to see you. - That's cool. - Congrats on the engagement. Come on in, Dylan's upstairs waiting for you guys. - Much appreciated. - Absolutely. Hi. Welcome, ladies. Here you go. Thank you. Hi, welcome. [dance music playing] [inaudible] Josephine Tully. My... My favorite telemarketer. Andrew, what a surprise. [sighs] If you're aiming to poach any of my clients again... I'm going to fuck you up. [snickers] Your ravenous personality is coming off a little desperate. Kind of cheap, don't you think? Well, no need to worry. I've already stolen all of your clients that I want. Hey. Have y'all seen a girl... I'm sorry, she's just like... She's Asian. She looks, like, really lawyery. She, like, dresses kind of like a lawyer. Would you like another one? Sure. [Andrew] What a drama queen. - [Josephine] Hm. - Oh, hey, Josie. What a great party. Explains why you look so tired. Ha! What a great jacket. Explains why you look so celibate. [Andrew] Cute. And Dylan, the once homeless music prodigy-turned-superstar. [sighs] Alex, how are you even here? I heard you were in rehab after your record label dropped your sorry ass. [Josephine laughs] But, really, I am loving the album. All the songs you stole from me seem to be doing really well. You should leave before I have you escorted out. [sighs] Do you know where the garage is? I believe it's... [dance music blaring] Raye? Raye? Where are you? [sighs] Come out. Baby... seriously. Ooh. You in here? [car alarm chirps] What the fuck? [gasps] Fuck. You want to fuck with me, huh? [dance music throbbing] [grunts] [whimpers] Let's start your set early. This is starting to feel a little less release party, a little more high school, Bud Light-only shindig. Buck the fuck up. You're a DJ. DJs are not manic depressive. Knock 'em dead. You're late. Where are the others? Clearly also late. We want to talk with you privately. Of course, I'm happy to. I have a few things I need to take care of first, but you can help yourselves to a drink. Yeah, do what you got to do. We should wait for the other two anyway. It is amazing what 12 hours can do for the rationale of someone in this town. You're free to explore. All of the house is open. I thought we agreed in the car that I would handle the talking. Well, I changed my mind, okay? There's no use wasting words if Raye isn't here anyway. Fine. I'm going to go look for a bathroom, okay? You guys stay here. Let me guess. You're going to wander off, too. Crowds make me anxious, remember? But running outside in the middle of the night doesn't? No. Surprising for a limp dick like me, huh? Where the fuck is that stalker guy and lawyer girl? It's 10:45. I saw Hunter... when I got here. Okay, why didn't you tell me this? I figured he just came in and took the money and left. It seemed like his MO last night, and he hadn't heard from, uh... his... whatever she was, I don't know. - So it's... - This is weird. We should go look for him. No, no, no, Ivy told us to stay here. I'll text her, come on. [Colton, on answering machine] It's Colton. Leave one at the beep. - [answering machine beeps] - Where the hell are you? This is happening in the next hour with or without you. - [sighs] - [phone beeps off] [sultry techno music playing] ♪ I need you ♪ ♪ Feel the music ♪ ♪ I feel you ♪ - ♪ In every... ♪ - Pierce? [Brecken] How many bathrooms are in there? How many bathrooms do we have? Oh, my fucking God! Didn't I fucking say this was going to happen? Thanks a lot. You ever heard of the word "sorry"? [slurps] You owe me a drink. I... I owe you a drink? You fucking spilled the drink on me. [Jake] Just go to the bathroom, okay? [Brecken] Listen, I'm going to be back. Don't worry, I'll keep the door open and meet me here. Pierce. Pierce, wait. - [jiggles doorknob] - Hey. Pierce. [Brecken] This is a new level of self-obsession. [tap water runs] [loud thump] [turns water off] Actually, if it's no trouble, do you mind keeping the door open? Oh, it's a voyeur. Kinky. Look, don't be nervous. I saw you looking. Yeah, I'm a... I'm a window shopper. Is this a normal look for you? You know, goods exposed and tensions on display chic. Look, it's all right if you're not out. Listen, this scene is more about energy. You're not gay. We're just fimming. Actually, I am gay. And while I admire your 20-something mesh shirt, cum gutters, fuck-boy routine, I'm really not interested. Twenty-something? I'm 19, bitch. [loud thump] Mm, so jumpy. - You tweaking? - [sighs] I'm into that. No, I'm... I'm not tweaking. If I make out with you, will you let me leave? [dance music playing] Pierce? [sighs] Hey. Hi. I don't actually know your name. Okay. Yeah, it's probably better that way. There's something you need to see. Okay, well, can we wait? Brecken's in the bathroom and I don't know where Ivy is. Who? No, it can't wait. Your suicidiac friend... I don't think she's really dead. [door closes] What the fuck? [thump] Oh, shit. Oh! [gasping] [sobbing] No, no, no. Oh no, no, no! [grunting] No! [panting] [grunting] [breathing heavily] [gun cocks] [breathing heavily] [sobs] I don't have anything, please. What are you doing this? No. [dance music blaring] Jake? [woman laughs] Jake? [man laughs] [loud crash] [grunting] [knife piercing] [groaning] [groans] What... [Jake] What... What did you do to me? This is not what I had in mind for tonight. My plan was perfect. It was foolproof. Oh, stop it. I didn't hit you that hard. Where are Brecken and Ivy? At this point, I'd assume they're dead. But I kept you alive, so you're welcome. - Kept me alive? - Yeah. I noticed some weird shit going down, I saw you on the stairs, I came over... You said Pierce was still alive. I had to say something to motivate you. Didn't want to leave with, "I think there's a killer in the house." [scoffs] You're lying. Excuse me? That's your job, right? Lies, business deals. Why should I trust you? Oh, wow. You could start with the fact that you are still breathing. Now, stop being a little shit. [scoffs] The party has cleared out. I need your help. [gasping softly] [breathing heavily] [grunts] You want to go, bitch? Okay. [grunts] [grunts] [panting] Fuck! - Hey. - Oh! Oh, my God. There's someone wearing your mask and there's this... Hey, it's Josephine, okay? She's been targeting all your friends. You can't trust anyone. Not even your friends. I thought all my friends were dead. [scoffs] Look, I won't say anything. You scared the shit out of me, and I'm successfully scarred for life, okay? Just... Just let me leave, please? [loud crash] [Josephine] No. You walk out this door and you are dead. We just need to hang on for 15, 20 more minutes. I have people on the way. The police? No, of course not. I'd rather not commit career suicide. And God favors those who help themselves. We should have never gone to that show. I am one pervasive fuckup. Older sister is supposed to be the rock, right? What a fucking joke. Yeah, I saw her, too. What? Your sister. I saw her tonight, too. How did you know I saw her? You told me. - [Jake grunting] - Whoa. You're really milking this. [grunts] - [Josephine grunts] - Whew. Now, Josephine is good, but she's not that good. [chuckles] Now, I think we have some unfinished business. After all, you did try to butch me with a very expensive piece of art up there. It was my favorite. The great Brecken. [breathing heavily] I sliced and diced his ass. [whimpers] - [chuckles] - [gasps] [car alarm blares] [grunts] [breathing heavily] [whimpers] [gasps] Oh, Jake, Jake, Jake. - Jake, Jake. - [Jake] What? It's not Josephine. It's Dylan. I just hit her in the head with a crowbar. What? I thought she was the fucking killer. Oh, my God. Fuck. We got to get out of here. [inaudible chatter] [Jake] Holy shit! Fuck! Go, go, go! The last few days have been pretty rough for me. You guys weren't even in the equation. I just wanted to axe my fucking team. You know, they wanted to throw me under the bus, and we know how ravenous the media can be. You know, you're playing sold-out venues, you're drinking thousand-dollar champagne. And one allegation... one video... Yeah, I know. ...one misplaced tweet, and you're at the fucking bottom! You're... Insane? We kind of have to be to be in this industry. On display 24/7. Fuck. Scrutinized, dissected. Held to some... Some strange unobtainable standard. You know, I've done some shit to get to where I am today, and I can't have people trying to steal that rug from underneath me, now can I? Your sister, though... [inhales sharply] ...she was a wild card. - An unexpected hang-up. - [Jake] Come on, man, just... She... - Shut the fuck up! - [Jake grunts] [Ivy breathing heavily] She... She... She saw through my soul. You know, I... I really believed that. We had a real... A real twin flames moment. You know, broken people attract broken people. Wouldn't you agree? [breathing heavily] [Jake] You think you're going to get away with this? Ah, there it is. [chuckles] There it is. [exhales] The question. Yes. Yes, I am. Now, Josephine... you know, her evidence she had against me, I'll use as proof for her obscure and dangerous obsession. Now, after covering up a suicide... she hunted down the witnesses to tie up those loose ends. And I'll be playing Vegas on Friday, and I'll be through on Sunday. [gunshot] Fat chance, asshole. You... Oh, you have always been a little shit. But this? Oh, this is next level. Being an artist... constantly innovating. [chuckles] Oh, fuck you, Dylan. Go. Get out of here. [gasps and wheezes] [gasps] Pierce? We saw you die. [Pierce] On one hand, there's a theory how people are inherently good. And then on the other hand, there's the whole of human history. [grunting] [coughs and gasps] [gasps] Oh, my God. This is impossible. Yet here I am. You're a murderer? An accomplice. The best things come in twos. Dylan showed me a world... that wasn't... [sighs] ...what was holding me back. [Ivy, sobbing] Please stop, Pierce. And importantly... he gave me a second chance at life. [gasps] I loved you. Sometimes that's just not good enough. - [knife pierces] - [gasps and sobs] I'm a fucking ghost now! There are no secrets for me anymore. This isn't you. I know it isn't you. [grunts] [Ivy] What are you doing? I appreciated your plan for revenge, Ivy. Surprising to actually see my big sister stand up for me for once. Let's see you come back from that, bitch. - No, no! - [gunshot] [Ivy gasps] [sighs] [Ivy] What the fuck? [breathing heavily] What the fuck? - What the fuck? - [exhaling] What is wrong with you two? I guess you weren't too far off with the sociopathic floodgate. [Dylan] Oh. Selling your soul to the devil... does come with its perks. A favor here, a favor there, say a... a ghostly companion. If I'm going to be eternally damned... you better believe I'm gonna get all the upgrades I can. It wasn't too long ago you wanted to die, Ivy. Who better to help you than me? "Life has been a walking shadow. "A poor player who struts "and frets his hour upon the stage... and is heard no more." "It is a tale told by an idiot... full of sound and fury..." [Ivy sobbing] "...signifying nothing." [Ivy whimpers] - [knife pierces] - [Ivy gasps] [body thuds] [gasps softly] Hey, Dylan, I'm... I'm sorry I passed out on the piano last night. [laughs] It was crazy. Who were you talking to? - [blade pierces] - [gasps and coughs] - [blade rings] - [body thuds] ♪ ♪
