For every young man who travels far away to study... for every father who wants his son to succeed... we dedicate this movie. May the former realize the causes of disgrace, and avoid them... and may the latter see the road to wisdom, and seek it. SHADIA TAHEYYA KARIOKKA SHOUKRY SARHAN A WOMAN'S YOUTH DIRECTED BY SALAH ABOU SEIF - Bless you, priest. - In Cairo, watch out for 2 things... women, and tramways. - I think tramways are more dangerous. - They're equally dangerous. The two leading causes of death. God help us. Did you sell it? It was our sole livelihood. It couldn't be helped. We had to get the money for your school year... - or should I let you go penniless? - But it's a pity... A pity? If I could sell my soul for you, I would. - You're all I have. - Thank you, mother. All I pray for... is that I live long enough to see you with your diploma. Why are you crying? You're leaving. It will be the first time you go away. You'll be gone long. Mother... Imam... Hurry up. The train's leaving. Here. Keep it in a safe place. Pray for me, mother. May god grant you success. - Hurry up, men. - God help us all. Is everything ready? - Did you pack up everything? - Don't worry. Don't you trust us? - God help you, young man. - Pray for him, Darwish. - What's in this one? - Cheese and rice. - And this one? - You want to open each one and check? God help her. God, spare me the pain of separation. May he come back to you a fresh graduate, and first in his class. God willing, he will. Son, don't fall asleep with the windows open. God, give us patience. Don't put all your money in one pocket... if they rob one packet, you'll have what's in the other one. Always walk along the wall. After school, go back straight to your room. If you see a fight, don't get involved. Cairo thieves fake fights to rob people. - They're almost as bad as tramways. - That's true. Be careful of women in dresses or skirts. They're treacherous. The worst ones wear trousers nowadays. Sayyidah Zaynab, if only I could visit your shrine... Don't worry, Imam is a good boy. He's always been good... - never misses a prayer. - Hand this letter to Mister Sharnoubi. The address is right here. He's a big functionary. Don't be bashful. He was a good friend of your father. He's Salwa's father, the girl you used to play with. - God help us all. - Do you remember her? - I do, but does she? - No. Cairo makes one forget everything. Mister Sharnoubi is the one who took care of your college application. I put in a good word for you with him. They'll be your family. They were good neighbors. They're decent people. Enough talk. Let's go. The train's here. The gentleman needs a place to stay. Can you help? - Put your stuff back there. - So you can help? Didn't I say put your stuff back there? - Good morning. - Hello there. The room we talked about... is it still available? - Yes. - This good man needs it. Well... He's from my village. He's practically family. Our brothers were friends. How long will you be staying? - How much is it? - For you: 150 cents, payed in advance. Please, not so much. He's a student. You know it can't be helped. Fine. I'll pay. Here. - Don't you want to see the room first? - There's no need. I feel I can trust you. Here. Write the contract. By the time you get your luggage, it will be ready. - Take this luggage inside. - Yes. This way. - Here you go. - No need for this between relatives. Tell me, what's your name? Imam Beltagi Hassanein. - Where from? - Western district. Welcome. Come in. In the name of God... How far is the faculty of science? - First time in Cairo? - Yes. By tramway or bus, not too far. - How far is it? - About 10 to 12 minutes by bus. So an hour's walk. - Just about. - Not bad. Hello. A good breeze, and lots of sunlight. I like it. Get the rest of it. That one is locked. The boss. What boss? I'm trying to make a living. Just let it go. It's not yours. God help us. - God help us from women like you. - Watch it. - I rented the spare room for 150. - What, you fool? A nice young man, a student from the countryside. How dare you decide that? Idiot. This student is not staying in my place. Go kick him out now. Why? Do I need the money? You rent the room to a stranger who might be a bum? - Go kick him out. - Yes. Ruining the house's reputation. Get me the millstone workers. I want to talk to them. Hello. Hello again. You know, Moubarak... this room is no good. My dear man... the prophet, God bless his name, once said... Stay strong, as comfort does not last. You're a devout man... and there's no sink to wash. - Is there no cask? - Unfortunately not. I'll hire a water carrier. I don't know about that. Besides... the noise from the millstone... and the millstone workers will keep you from studying. That won't bother me at all. So you like this room? Yes, thanks for giving it to me. I'll write my mother, and tell her you remind me of my father. Fine, son... - but it's so damp here. - I'm not sleeping on the floor. You'll get me a carpenter... he'll make me a bed out of a few planks of wood. Back home, I used to sleep on hay. What do you say? Not a bad idea. Let's do that. I can't do that. You pay and take it with you. This is a mill, not a warehouse. So, is it done? Better keep him till the month's end. - So you got cold feet. - But... You think this is your house? I'll throw his stuff in the street. Stop. Help me. Quick. He'll die. - Thank you, young man. - Strong as a bull. Go back to work. You too. You're fine. I am so grateful for what you did. - If it weren't for you... - It's nothing. Let me help. I'm so sorry I don't have clothes on. - Do you live around here? - Yes. - Where exactly? - Right here. - Here? Where? - This room. Do I kick him out? - Should I? - Get out of my face. It's no good. You must wash it. - Take it off and give it to me. - Never mind. What? It's dirty. I said take it off. - I'll wash it. - I'll do it. It was my fault. - It was the mule's fault, not yours. - Zip it, donkey. Strange. Take it off already. I have an important appointment. How do I get to Abbassiyah? Abbassiyah? You don't know? Poor man. Do you not know Cairo? First day here. Where were you before? - In our village, in Tanta. - How nice. Living in mommy's lap? - What's all this? - Good stuff. - My provisions. - Provisions? Why? Going on a sea voyage? Did you travel by foot or by camel? By train. Freight or commuter? Oh my. It's so good. Move it. Take him to the bus stop. - Yes. - No need for a bus. Just show me the way. Push the button. Push hard. Hurry, let's go. Idiot. No brains? Go away. Stay, my love, and stop berating me. You love me, and your eyes have cast their spell on me... They've all warned me about you. Watch it. Please never let me go. Watch it. Sharnoubi Those who talk are just jealous... of our love, and wish to drive us apart. I won't believe them, no matter what they say. When you're near, I'm at peace. I'm afraid one day you'll forget me. May that day never come. If you leave me, they'll all take their revenge on me. Your heart might some day change... and the time will come when you go away, but we're still at the start of our road. Before you forget my love, and steal my heart away... Oh dear. Who are you? Wait. - Oumoum? - Do you still remember? Who can forget those childhood days? How's Ezza? - Ezza? - Your mother. She must have cried when you left. - A little. - I miss her so much. How is she? And how's the village? How are the trees and the streams? - We need to catch up. I'll make coffee. - I don't drink coffee. I'll get you orange juice then. Father must be on his way. Here. From my sister. Take it. Drink it in one shot. Is he up to his tricks? That's how Cairo boys are. I'll show you. Please. - Imam Hassanein. - Welcome, son. Sorry I didn't recognize you. How many years has it been? Welcome. - Thank you, sir. - Please sit. Welcome. - When did you arrive? - This morning. Welcome. Did she recognize you? You were just kids. - How's your mother? - Fine, thank god. - She sends her best regards. - She is a wonderful mother. I hold her in high esteem. Your father, god rest his soul... was such a good friend. - Thank you. - I delivered your application papers. Everything is in order. All is good. - I am grateful. - How is the village? - Did the irrigation project reach you? - Yes, two years ago. - A letter from Abou El Kheir. - And how is he? - He's good. - Fathi... Go tell your mother that Steta's and Hassanein's son is here. He tells me to take care of you. If this apartment wasn't so small... - you would have stayed with us. - I understand. - Are you staying in a hotel? - I rented a room. - Good man. - Already? - Give us your address. - Of course. Is it a good room? - Not bad. - You must stay away from trouble. - Of course. - Where's my wife? Fathi... where's your mom? Excuse me. Welcome. Abou El Kheir says... that they sold everything. Poor woman. Cairo is so expensive. Education is so costly. Listen, can't you find him a job in the afternoons? It will take me a long time to find something. He says they need help immediately. We can't just hand him money. He won't accept. What if he tutored Fathi... - and we payed him? - Good idea. What's this? Why are you here? He's all alone. You're with him. - I'm embarrassed to be alone with him. - Why? Isn't he a childhood friend? - Which grade are you in? - Nominated for the 3rd. Nominated? What's that? I must pass the remedial class first. Remedial? Don't you study hard? You've asked me so many questions. Let me ask you one. Will you be a teacher or a student at this college? A student. A student, at your age? Did you think I was a teacher? - I thought you were a principal. - No, just a student. Just like me. Can a student teach a student? It won't do. Good man. Mother asks you to open this. It's stuck. Welcome to our house. How are you? And your mother? I miss her. Please send my regards. - She must come visit us. - Of course. - I'd hug me, but you've a man now. - His mustache is prickly. Boy, be quiet. Go study. I was thinking you can give him some Arabic lessons. - My pleasure. - Then I'll pass, and he'll fail. Bad boy. - We'll both pass. - Hopefully. - I'll excuse myself. - You must stay for dinner. - I... - Please, you must stay. - Leave him be. - Stay still. - Dinner is ready. - But I... Come now, don't be a stranger. Prayer time... Devout people, wake up. From Ibn Malik's Alfiya, a 13th century rhymed book of Arabic grammar. Don't just lay there. Stop him. Have you gone deaf? I'll show you. Stop this racket right now. - What's wrong? - What do you think? The racket, the noise, the mess... Where do you think you are? - In my house, I do as I please. - Your house? You think it's your house, little fella? If you want to stay here, you must quit this nonsense. - Otherwise, I'll throw you out. - Dear god. - Don't talk like that. - Did you forget who I am? You must talk politely. No need for coarse words. You should act like a lady. Act like a lady? Why don't you learn how to wear trousers first? - Shut up. - I'll show you, you... You can't stay here another day. Hassabou. You scum, where are you? What have you done? What happened? I was studying... she came in, and started insulting me. I tried to be courteous... she raised her hand at me. What is this? By god, I won't stay here. She can keep the money. She has a temper, but she's got a good heart. I would have hit her, but she's an older woman. - In any case... - Are you going out? Yes. First day of college. It's too early for classes. I'll walk. It's too far. Why don't you have breakfast first... and then take the bus for a penny? I like to walk. It's good exercise. Hassabou is just like Abou El Kheir... He keeps an eye on me... and makes sure I can focus on my studies... he even stays up with me... in spite of his old age... in order to encourage me to study. God bless you, mister Hassabou. - Who is it? - Imam. No one's here. They're out. - Fathi... - Fathi? - He's away. - Should I come tomorrow? No. They don't need your services. - Who are you? - Me? The butler. Boy. What are you doing? Let him go. Oh. You're in? This boy is impossible. Please, come in. - It is fine. - I'll tell father about this. - Never mind. He sure got me. - He went too far. - Excuse me. I'll tell mom you're here. - Please. Imam's here. What time is it? - I thought he was coming for dinner. - The time will pass quickly. Time passes quickly when you have good company. I'll make him a cup of tea. - Here. It's really good. - Nice try. - Believe me. It's good. - No thanks. As you wish. - Thank you. - You take it from her, but not from me? - You got something against me? - Hush, and get your books. - Drink first. - Go. Here I go. How are... How's Cairo treating you? Not good. - What is it? - The room... It's noisy, and the landlord is crazy. I need a quiet place to study. We'll help you find a place in our neighborhood. - As long as it's affordable. - Of course. - And how's school? - Good. - I'm in my third year. - Great. You'll be a music teacher. Girls like music. You'll enjoy your job. - I hope so. - I got a letter from home. - You did? - My mom thanks you for your kindness. No need. It's nothing. What is it? - Waiting for my turn. - Is that so? Sit down. - I'm going to tell dad. - Tell him what? That he should tutor you instead. - Are we studying or what? - Yes, begin. Hurry. They're going to ask you to stay for dinner. If you want to get out of it... better leave now. Open the book. - In the name of God... - We don't study the Koran at school. - You did the homework? - Yes. I love the cat alot. I love Salwa alot. What's this? The cat's name is Salwa. But... it's 'a lot', not 'alot'. - No, I think you got it wrong. - Give me the pen. Here. What? Who is it? - Good morning. - Hello. - Excuse me. - Why did you sleep in? I was up late studying. I heard the alarm clock... and was afraid you'd be late. - It's Friday. No school. - Oh my. I'm sorry. Sorry I woke you up. I'll leave you be. No, it is good you did. You're just being polite. No, I prefer to rise early. Sleep is for the lazy. More studies today? I have many shrines to visit... on behalf of people from my village. What a coincidence. I was planning on visiting... - my poor husband's grave. - May he rest in peace. He was a prince, a gentleman... he died and left me all alone in this world. - It is such a hard life. - God give you strength. I hope you're not upset over our quarrel. It wasn't a big deal. I feel so bad about it. - I hope you can forgive me. - I already have. - Going to Hussein? - Yes. - Can I come along with you? - Of course. Visiting the deceased is godly. Thank you. In this case... you get dressed... - and I'll make breakfast. - Please don't bother. No, I insist. - You don't have to. - It's my pleasure. God forgive me. You are very dutiful, mam. A woman with no man is helpless... - and my husband was a man's man. - Patience is virtue. Fridays are an occasion for me to escape from the house. - Going to Sayyidah? - Yes. Mind if I come along? - But... - But what? I've troubled you so much today. Allow me to buy you lunch. - Let's stop by a restaurant. - How could we? - Why not? Don't you have sisters? - I wish. Consider me your sister then. We're like siblings. Siblings can share a meal. Please help. May you see your son succeed in life. Let's go. This is good. - Garcon. - Yes. - Two whiskeys. - Coming right up. - God forgive me. - It's OK. It's local, legal whiskey. It's fine. - If you say so. - Here's the whiskey. Does it burn? Yes, my tongue is on fire. I'm so happy. This reminds me of the days with my husband. I'm so glad. What a great day. I want to ask you a favor. Of course. - Let's go to the movies. - Movies? - But what would people say? - Why would they say anything? They'll think we're siblings, or married... Besides, it's dark in there. In Cairo, you do as you please. But we've been out so long already. You're right. Forget it. I'm not your sister, nor your wife. I didn't mean it like that... My fate is to be unhappy forever. - Don't worry, we'll go. - I don't want to. - Please, I want to. - Fine. Call the waiter. Yes, coming. 24, plus 30... plus 6, makes 60 total. - Keep the change. - Thanks so much. 60 on table 2, paid by the lady. This movie was so funny. - I almost died laughing. - Are you studying tonight? - Of course. - I'll make you a good cup of tea then. What is this? Where have you been, mam? You've left us all stranded. You didn't leave instructions with me... Instructions? What are you, invalids? You're driving me crazy. It's nuts. What am I paying you money for? Lay off me already. - We were worried. - Why? Am I a child? A baby? Can't take care of myself? Or are you spying on me? What is it? If you don't like it, leave. - Try to understand... - Get out of my face, you old fox. Have pity, he means well. Are you on their side as well? - No, but... - Enough, don't say anything. Woe is me. All alone in the world. Mam... Don't cry. I want to die. Dear me. Mister Hassabou. No, don't call him. I don't want to see him. He's the cause of all this. Mam... Be strong. Woe is me. No shoulder to cry on. Why can't I enjoy life, like other women? And I thought I've finally found a man... a brother... but he let me down as well. Me? What did I do? I'm cold. Can you close the window? Can't you even manage to close the window? - It's Imam. - Imam? Strange. Open. Welcome. - Good morning... I mean evening. - Come in. I'm sorry... - I've come so late. - No, I was still up. - Is your father asleep? - No, he's in Alexandria tonight. - I see, excuse me... - Wait, I'll wake mom up. - No please, don't. - I'm up. - Good evening. - Hello. I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour. - What is it, son? - Isn't it Friday? Why are you here? - Want to get a free dinner? - Hush. Tell me. What is it? - It's... I'm a little distraught. - Make him some coffee. - He doesn't drink coffee. - He likes tea. I'll make him some. Tell me everything. I wish I stayed in a hotel. Something wrong with the room? - The room's fine. - Is it the neighbors? The landlord? People are indecent nowadays. - Cairo's like that, son. - I found you a good room. - Is it true? - Yes, spacious, clean, and affordable. - When can I move in? - It's available right now. You'll be able to relax and focus on your studies. God willing, I will rent it tomorrow. - Excuse me. - Drink your tea first. Some other time. What's bothering you? Nothing. Why did you run away? Do you fear me? - I fear the devil. - There's no devil between us. Our love is pure and innocent. I'm a poor woman... in need for a shoulder to cry on... I found a pure heart in you... I wish you could take me away from here... and take care of me... and sooth me with kind words. What are you afraid of? If you hate me, tell me. Don't worry, I am resigned to my fate. No, it's just... - I fear people's gossip. - No one can see us. Have you nothing to say? You hate me, I know it. I... I don't hate you. Do you love me? I've already told you never to hit the mule. See who it is. - Who is it? - It's me. Open. Who? I've been knocking for a while. What time is it? - 8:30 - Oh no. You must have stayed up very late. - How could I have slept so long? - You're overdoing it. Take it easy. See, you've missed the morning prayer. I was tired. 'Have mercy on your youth, and old age will have mercy on you'. Don't be surprised. I've read many books in my day. Here, take this. I don't feel like it. You look so pale and tired. You've over-exerted yourself. I'll get you an aspirin and some tea. No, I'll go back to sleep. Sleep? What about school? - I can't go today. - What is this? You study all night, and then you skip school? I'll get you the aspirin. - Who is it? - It's me. - "Me" who? - Imam. Dear me. What do you want? I... Mister Imam, please. Good morning. - Good morning. - Hand me a cigarette. Light it. You've got it backwards. Let me. Blow. First time I smoke. It feels it's your first time doing everything. What did you do back home? - I was focused on my studies. - Aren't you going to school today? No, I'm tired. A vacation day? Where are you taking me? - Do you need anything? - Open, son. I was about to fall asleep. What have you done to yourself? Here, drink. I don't take medications. Maybe not in the village, but you have to here. Do you know why I got up so early? I've been thinking of something all night... it's kept me up till dawn. What is it? I was thinking of your devoutness and virtue... and I decided to walk in your footsteps... and quit drinking, and start praying. I want you to wake me up every morning so that we go pray together. You scum. You're deaf now? I was on my way, but... Go collect the money from Abd El Baee. - But it's not due yet. - I need it now. Go get it. - I need to sort out the receipts... - Sort out your brain first. - Are you going or what? - I will, immediately. The poor boy is not feeling well. He needs my help... How is that your business? Scram. - Yes. I won't be long. - I also need some fenugreek... Ask them to make it while you're there. - Yes. I'll be back shortly. - One more thing... Get me two pounds of butter. - Yes. Don't worry, I'll be quick. - I am not done. Stop by Oum Azziz, tell her to drop by. - Go. - Yes. - Fast. - Right away. Ready for breakfast? All this for me? Love gives you appetite. And we can eat slowly... now that the old idiot is gone. I can't stand him. Drink. God forgive me. I've never... Stop acting like a child. You're a man now. Drink. - Drink. - It's the first time... Again? Drink. - What time is it? - Where's your watch? I don't have one. Close your eyes. Open. - For me? - Yes. You're so good. You like it? I never dreamed of having a gold watch. A gold watch? I'm so happy. I'll get a chain... and hang it by my pocket... this way. Tell the tailor, he'll take care of it. - What tailor? - The tailor who's making your new suits. We're one now. What's yours is mine... and what's mine is yours. I don't know what to do with my money. We'll spruce you up. We'll buy you some fancy suits... shirts, and ties, and other things. - But... - But what? Consider it a loan. You'll pay me back once you get a job. - In that case, fine. - Great. Tell me... if you got a job abroad, would you forget me? I would never leave. I can't bear being away from you. Me neither. This is so nice... love is so sweet. Not any love. Just mine. If you love someone else, I'll kill you. I get very jealous. How can I possibly love someone else? I love you eyes. Damn your eyes. We haven't seen Imam in a week. - Where is he? - Why don't you ask the rascal? Me? What did I do? You kept pestering him, until he stopped coming. - Who cares about him? - Shut your mouth. Do you hear? - Son, stop writing on the wall. - I'm studying. - Studying on the wall? - Yes. Geography. Your father will smack you. - Can't you check on him at school? - Yes, go check on him. You're going to be in trouble. - He's got other things to do. - That's it. Come here. Leave him be. When dad comes, I'll... What is this? Why are you crying? He kept annoying Imam until he stopped coming. I think there's more to that. Abou El Kheir wrote me. They haven't heard news from him in a while. What about college? I asked. He's not showing up. - Is that my fault as well? - You keep quiet. - What if he's sick? - That must be it. A little more. Second try. Third. Strange. It's the first time I miss. Usually, I get it the first time. Your lifestyle has changed. That's probably why you missed. Yes, studying is hard, you know. Yes, I know you've been putting a great effort into your... studies. One stays up so late studying. I know, I did a lot of studying in my youth too. Swing and sway, oh tender one. Shake and undulate, we're all watching. Dance towards me, to the beat of the drum... the roses bloom as you pass them by... What is all this beauty? Yes, just like that... - Do you like that girl? - She's not bad. What's special about her? - She's a good dancer. - You call that dancing? She was trudging like a cow. Move it. She's no dancer. - You want to see real dancing? - Where? Where? Here. Sit. All the world's beauty is in your dance. The moon shies away when you come along. Come on now, and shake your waist... Sweet and lovely, like a gazelle. And tell him: If you had siblings, it would be easier on me... but you're all I have... a word from you would give me strength... I need to know how you're doing... are you happy and content, or are you struggling? Why are you not writing me, son? - Imam Beltagi Hassanein. - I'll take it. I've got two letters for him. - I'll take them. - Sign here. Hand it over. - What about those who can't write? - They can scribble. It's from college. What's it about? 'We notify you that we will expel you'... 'if you continue with your absenteeism'. - God help us. He's not attending? - It seems he isn't. - Strange. - It would be strange if he's attending. Most of these letters are notices to absentee students. - Kids these days. Goodbye. - So long. Welcome. Good thing you're here. I was afraid you went to school already. My class had a field trip today. I decided not to go. - I have no time for trips. - What a serious young man. - School must be hard. - Very hard. - How is it going? - It's moving along. Moving? Left or right? - What do you mean? - Son, are you deceiving yourself? If you're ashamed of me, a perfect stranger... how are you going to confront your poor mother? What is this? Your school sent you a warning. Isn't that shameful? How dare you read my mail? Shafaat was right about you. Is that so? You're right, son. I wronged you. I am sorry. Forgive me. Here are your letters. Don't be sad, mister Hassabou. I didn't mean it. - You know I respect you, but... - I know, son. I am so worried about you. - Forgive me. - There's nothing to forgive. Can you come with me? - Where to? - Just come. Come. Tell me... If I showed you an old, destitute, broken fool... would you believe me if I told you he was once a vibrant, affluent man... - with a wife, a family and children? - Strange. What happened to him? That's what I wanted to tell you. Sit down. Do you want to know what happened to him? The devil. A woman, like the one who's trapped you... brought him down... destroyed him... he gave her everything, until he had nothing... and took what was not his... he embezzled, and stole... - and went to jail. - Dear god. - Why did he do that? - Because he was blind. The devil blinded him. Don't you believe me? This will happen to you too, if you stay on this road. What road is that? I don't have things to lose. You have two things to lose: Your youth and your future... and that's a priceless treasure. If you lose them, one day you'll end up... just like me. God. You, mister Hassabou? Yes. Poor man. But, your family... Why did you leave them? I couldn't confront them after jail. I stayed away... my daughter... I wonder what has become of you? My son Mohammad is about your age. If only I could see them one more time before I die. Why don't you go to them? God is forgiving. But society is not forgiving, son. If I came back, I'd taint them with my shame. No. They shouldn't pay for my sins. I am a disgrace... - that should not touch them. - Don't say that. - You've repented long ago. - Who told I ever did? Up to this day, whenever I see her, my heart leaps in its cage. Once you're trapped, it's hard to escape. It's a chronic illness, cured only by death. Save yourself, son, before it's too late. Go back to your good ways. When you first came, you were as pure as snow... remember, son? A man who sells his body to a woman... is as bad as a woman who sells her body to a man. Mister Hassabou. Don't you believe me? - I believe you. - Thank god. Look at me... and look at this picture... and make a choice. Mister Imam. A lady is asking for you. - How are you? - Welcome. What a surprise. Don't stay out here. Please come inside. - Inside? - Yes, please, this way. She's like my sister. We grew up together. Welcome. This way. We've been so worried. We haven't heard from you in 10 days. - He was very ill, dear. - That's what I thought. Your mother sent a letter. She's worried. I haven't written to her in a long time. And school said you were not attending classes... - so we were worried. - So nice of you, dear. Father told me to come to check on you. - Congratulations. - On what? Your improving health. - Miss Salwa, right? - Yes, Salwa. I've heard so much about you. Imam often speaks of you. He holds you in very high esteem. Listen, dear. We must thank god... for saving him from the danger he was in. - Isn't that so? - Thank god. I was... planning on visiting you today. Hassabou. Excuse me. - Let me help you. - Never mind. Where's Imam? Imam... is out. Why are you whispering? Speak up. - I told you he's out. - Why are you acting like this? - I'm afraid... - What? - I'm afraid the mule... - What's up with the mule, you donkey? Who's that? Who's that? She's the landlord. - Why are you all scared? - She's a little crazy. - Let go of me. - Just a word, please. - What do you want? - Here's your money. Pass, go, before I expire. You must get out... Finally, thank god. I feel much better now. Must be something I ate. - When did Imam leave? - Who knows with that foolish kid? - Why don't we kick him out... - Stay out of it. It's none of your business. - Where's the mule? - Mule? They took it out for a stroll. You lost out on the room. It was available for a week... but it's gone now. Too bad. Maybe you don't want to move. I do want to, so that I can be... close to you... I mean close to your family. - I don't know. - What? I don't feel you want to see me. I really wanted to visit you... - but I was sick. - Take better care of yourself. - So you care about me? - Why are you asking? I want to know why you care about my health. - Don't you know? - No. Tell me. - For my brother's sake. - And what else? - So you go to school. - What else? - So you can study. - What else? That's all. - Are you certain? - Yes. Fine. I will stay healthy, and visit... Fathi, and Fathi's father, and Fathi's mother. - And who else? - That's all. - Are you certain? - No, and... Fathi's sister. You promise you'll study? I'll study at a friend's place. I'll look for another room for you. It's getting late. Let's go. - Come here right now. - Coming. God give me strength. - Is it morning yet? - Come here and focus. Sit. - Here I am. - Who's this? Pretty, but... - not as much as you. Who is it? - Don't play dumb. Don't you know? Never seen her before in my life. She's your friend's friend. Are you fooling me? You know all his secrets. Speak. Who is she? Where did he meet her? You, a great woman... that makes every man shake in fear and desire... troubled by a little, pathetic student? I'm going to beat the life out of you. - You did that long ago. - Who is she? Who cares? You can have someone who worships you, who lives for you... - Have shame, old man. - I can't help it. What a mess. I love you, you love him, and he loves someone else. Forget about him, and let's rekindle our past. - You still have a pulse? - I sure do. The hair is gray, but the heart is young. That student is not worthy of you. Come back to me. Get away from me. Let him be. Where can he go? Come here. Get up. - Get up, good boy. - Let's go. Don't be shy. - Not in front of his legal guardian. - No need to explain. - He found himself a benefactor. - A kept man. - It's hopeless. - What's hopeless? - The mule lost his blinders. - Don't worry. I'll put them back on myself. Fine. Long time no see. - Where have you been? - I... exams are next week, so I was studying. - And... - and what? - That's it. - Where are you studying tonight? - At a friend's place. - How nice. - You see... - What? Don't worry. You want to leave me alone again tonight? Tell me. Didn't you miss me? - I did. - Aren't you going to greet me? Don't you have anything to tell me? Are you bashful again? Miss Shafaat, I wanted to say... Say what? Who's turned your head? Did you land in another nest? No, it's just that the exams... Exams? How much will they pay you, after you kill yourself studying? 12 pounds? I'll give them to you, and you can spare your eyesight. Still, a degree... - is important. - Sure. Tell your friends to come study with you here. Come here? I'll tell them. Should I make chicken? I'm actually invited for lunch... - I don't want to be late. - Who's invited you? - A friend from school. - Is he cooking for you? - Or is his sister cooking? - He doesn't have sisters. He lives alone. Poor man. Spare him the effort. Come up with an excuse. You're good at that. - Me? - Listen to me. You can't escape from me. Tell me... Chicken or beef? I guess chicken. I'm starving. What are we waiting for? For Imam, son. Some teacher, letting his student starve. - Did you remind him? - Yes. Maybe he's sick again. Or he forgot. Who forgets food? He's not coming. You eat. What's this? Have mercy on the poor creature. The mistress wants it to work day and night. - Have mercy, please. - She has none. What's wrong? - I feel dizzy. - You study too hard. You never let me study. I'll get you some fish. It will fortify you. - Get me some medication instead. - Never mind that. Don't study in my absence. - Why is this mule resting? - Mister Hasabou untied it. It's spent. It must rest. - Did he tell you that personally? - Have mercy on the poor creature. The break's over. Get it back to work. God help you, and me. - Does Imam Beltagi live here? - Yes, sir. - Come in. - Hello. How are you, son? - Salwa knew you were sick again. - Come in, please. - Welcome. - What's wrong with you? I'm... feeling weak. I must have caught an illness... - maybe bilharzia. - Bilharzia, ancylostoma... and worms are rife around here. Dear sir, this young man can't stay here. The room's damp. Besides, there's no one here to take care of him. Why didn't you tell me? He's like my son. You must take him away from here. Deliver him from his trouble. I will. You must, and right away... - before he changes his mind. - Sounds good to you? He does not know what's best for him. I'll get a carriage. Don't make a fuss, please. - I'm fine. - See? He's hopeless. Quick, before she... before he changes his mind. Come now, let's go. - Thank god. - May you get well. Thank you. I've troubled you... I don't know how to thank you. There's no need. You're no stranger. Thank you, Salwa. I feel like I'm back home. Don't you realize we're your family? Father is your dad, mother is your mom, and I'm your sister. You're more than my sister. Soon you'll be... Enough talk. Let's study. The Hanafi school, started in Kufa... and spread across Iraq... Its adherents are called Hanafis... And the tenants of Abi Hanifa's theology... as evidenced by the honorable Malek... How nice. - Did you understand? - Not at all. What are you so distracted by? I'm thinking... can one live on 12 pounds? - Like who? - Like a man and his wife. Certainly, especially if... they love each other, and support one another. We can even save. I mean they can even save. What do you think father started at? 12 pounds too. Let's study. A comparison of... Excuse me. - Hello. - Is Imam here? - Who is it? - A relative. - How are you, honey? - Are you a villager? - Do I look like a peasant? - There's nothing wrong with peasants. No, he's a tenant at my place, miss... - Salwa. - Nice to meet you, miss Salwa. - This way. - Thanks, sister. This way. Thank god, you look much better now. How are you? I'm upset with you. Did you think I wouldn't take good care of you? Am I unable to nurse you? We're neighbors, after all. What shameful behavior. If I weren't sensible, I wouldn't have stood for this. I didn't listen to those who said you fled to avoid paying rent. - How did you find me? - I'm quite resourceful. You can't keep anything from me. Tell me, dear. Where are you manners? Aren't going to offer me something? Coffee, tea, lemonade? My love, what have you done? Why did you leave me alone like that? You must come back to our home. - Here you are. - There's no need. You must visit us, when Imam comes back home. Come back soon. The house is not the same without you. Goodbye. Bye, youngster. Why are you crying? - I'm not. - Why are you upset? I'm not upset. - Don't be silly. - Silly? Who is this lady? Why did she insult me? She's quite coarse. I'm just her tenant, nothing else. I thought you wanted to move. Why did you go back there? We had a fight, and she apologized. Looks like you reconciled quite well. Believe me, you're the only one. Once I'm better, I'm leaving that room, even if I become homeless. There are other rooms in the city. - There's a room available on our rooftop. - Great, I'll take it. - We'll see. - You don't believe me? I can't help trusting you. - Why are you pouting? - I'm not. Is that a smile or a pout? Smile. Show me your lovely smile. I protect you from the evil eye, and from the curse of the envious... may the devil stay away from you, and your enemies turn to dust... Welcome back. We've missed you. Go back to work. You come here. My love. Kiss me. - Didn't you miss me? - Please, don't. Are you tired? Sit, rest. If I knew you were coming, I would have prepared a feast. What do you want to eat? - I'm not staying. - Going somewhere? I'm here to take my things. I'll stay with a friend from school. You're leaving me, traitor? What have I done? Did I wrong you? We had it good. Why are you betraying me? Enough with this talk. Did you think I'd stay here forever? Staying with that family? - I said with a friend. - How nice. Why did you get all worked up? You little ungrateful fool... It's my fault. I let you trick me into surrendering to you. I tricked you? Lady, I need to focus on my studies. - I can't focus here. - Again with the studies? Admit it, you just want to be with that little spoiled child... - Your Salwa. - Please. - Don't mention her name. - That woman? That little snake? You leave me for her? Shut up. You want to hit me? I'll endure this. Don't leave me. I love you, I worship you. Have pity on my heart. Enough already. God forgive me. I strayed from the path. - Imam. - Enough. I can't forgive myself for what I've done. - If you need someone, find a husband. - Let's get married. Me, marry you? - Yes, son? - Please get me a carriage. Yes. Follow the carriage. See where he's going. - Hurry. - Yes. It's my fate and destiny, father... Yes, father, that's what god decreed. With god's help, I'll endure my fate... The world twists and turns, but your fate is unshaken... Endure, patience is virtue. Endure, and accept your fate. Don't despair, your day will come. Smile to the wound, it will heal, and the loved one will come back. Loved ones, you're far away. We long for you, and hold on to our patience. One day, we'll meet again, and our patience will be rewarded. You're good at many things: Music, food... - You cooked lunch, didn't you? - Yes, was it bad? - It was delicious. - I am glad. - But one thing's bothering me. - What? You made me breakfast, and then lunch. I'm afraid I'll get used to this. Please, my parents owe so much to your family. You know, Salwa? I wish I'd graduate already, so that you'd cook for me every day. - Better study, then. - I will. I'll make up for the time I wasted in my... sickness. - We'll have a bright future. - God willing. It's for you, sir. - Yes? - We need to search your home. - My house? - Yes, specifically Imam Beltagi's room. - But what for? - His landlord says he took her jewelry. He lives in a room on the rooftop. Get me the keys. Please. She a liar. He is an honest young man. We need to search anyway. As you wish. But I am certain he's innocent. We found it. He's guilty. - Watch out, the police is in your room. - Oh no. - Police? Why? - They say you stole from your landlord. - Excuse me. - Where to? I'll go sort this out. Don't you know it's wrong to steal? - Everybody uses electric power nowadays. - I don't like that. I don't trust it. Take it inside. - I need a word. - Go ahead. - Inside. - Why not here? - Go ahead, speak. - I said inside. Let's go. Easy on the suit. I paid... I mean he paid a lot of money for it. - Yes? - Listen here. I won't allow you to ruin me. You must confess to the police. You used to be bashful. Look at you now. Did you give me money? Did you pay me? What money? Should I expose you? All the money I spent on your makeover. Wasn't that all my hard earned money? Aren't you going to pay me back? Or are you going to rob me and leave? - You said it was a loan. - Loan? You took my loan, and abandoned me. Why ruin my future? You'll just spend a few months in jail. But my heart is ruined forever. - Let's sort this out. - Sure, let's talk. You owe me something. Pay me back. Are you willing to pay me? - I am. - Good. What will it be? - Will you pay, or go to jail? - But... - this is wrong. - Don't you worry. That little cute girl won't let you down. She'll visit you daily in prison. So, there's no changing your mind? Your poor mother, what will become of her when she finds out? Let's find a solution. - What can I do? - You must come back. Fine, I'll come back. Come back? How cute, how nice. Come back today and leave again tomorrow? - What are you saying? - I know your ways. You must marry me. - Marry you? - Yes. - We were fine without marriage. - That was before you betrayed me. Marriage will be my guarantee. It's that or nothing. You won't fool me twice. - Fool you? - Gharib. Orange juice. You better wise up and do as I say. It's marriage, or jail. If they arrest you, I won't help you. God damn you. Is there a student from the countryside... - Mister Imam? - Yes. Good boy. Come back soon. Come here, son. Thank god, we meet again. May god protect you, dear. - Welcome, mother. - How could you, son? A whole month with no news from you? You made me come here for you. - Mister Abou El Kheir. - We were worried, son. Why did the carriage go? Wait. Welcome. So nice to meet you. Take this inside. Welcome. Are you just going to stand here? Forgive him, he's troubled by an unfortunate incident. A friend of his stole some jewelry from his landlord. The police arrested him today. Why are you worried? Imam would never do such a foolish thing. This way. We've sprayed his room today. Please come to my room. Get us coffee. Leave this here. Please come in. I am honored by your visit. What a nice occasion. - Do you live here as well? - I own this place. - We're honored. - Me as well. Imam is such a nice man. He never gives me trouble, expect when he's studying. He's focused on his studies. I take good care of him here. - You've raised him well. - God bless you. You're like a second mother to him. How about you freshen up a little... and then we'll visit acquaintances? Yes, we'd like to visit the Sharnoubis. - How are they? - Doing well, I hope? - They're fine. - Imam holds Salwa in high esteem. - I hope they marry soon. - Shouldn't you tend to your poor friend? - Go help him, son. - What about our visit? It's still early. We'll visit them later. I want to see Salwa's reaction to the present. Looks like he's going to jail. Go, son, help your friend. Excuse me. I'll excuse myself as well. Welcome, what a pleasure. They all tell me to use electrical power... and sell the mule, but I've grown fond of it. You see, I'm very loyal. Then why are you hurting me? You take pity on the mule, and you wound me? It's in your hands. You can save yourself by marrying me. We'll marry. - But please, no more scandals. - Right now. With mother here? Would mother prefer to see you jailed? - How will you get me out of it? - Don't worry. I'll tell them it's not my jewelry. Let's go. Gharib, get my gown. - You've been married before, haven't you? - Yes. And you? First time? - Do you have your birth certificate? - It's at school. - You're a student? - Yes, I am. - How old are you? - What's this got to do with marriage? - Let's get this over with. - Yes, right away. - What's the dowry? - 50 pounds paid, 500 to go. 500? It is done. In the name of God... How can Imam stay in a place like this? - Dirty, and messy... - And the landlord is not virtuous. She talks nonsense, and she wears immodest clothes. We must ask him to move. That is a good idea. I deeply care for the boy's well being. - No more scandals. - Congratulate him. Get the drinks. - What's this? - What's the occasion? - Did Imam pass his exams? - He passed his biggest exam yet. - What happened? - He pondered, and chose well. - He saved his friend from jail. - God bless you, son. Can we visit Sharnoubi now? - Not today, mother. - Why not? It's Friday... They usually spend Fridays away. I want to see your bride, Salwa. How can you leave now? Hassabou, call the butcher. I'm so happy. We must celebrate this occasion. Please come inside. I'll prepare everything. Welcome. How nice of you to stop by. Everybody's here today. - Is Imam here? - Yes. His mother's here too. This reminds me of the old days. When he got silent like that as a boy... - it meant that he did something wrong. - That was long ago. Today, the whole village looks up to Imam, and to his virtue and good sense. - God protect you. - Come in. Good afternoon. My friend, hello. How are you, dear? How are your mother and brother? - They're fine, thank you, aunt. - My dear. What happened? I'm so sorry... I'll tell you later. - We were going to visit you later. - Why don't you come with us now? - The landlord is making us dinner. - Dinner? - How could you accept? - What's wrong with you? You have dinner with a lady who's accused you of robbing her? Robbing? What robbing? - Are you going to stay here? - You either leave this instant, or... - It's a misunderstanding. - Let's end it now. I don't like that lady at all, son. Listen, here. I'm bearing with you for the sake of Imam, my husband. Yes, my husband. And this is his house, so behave yourselves. - Show respect to this house and to me. - God damn you. - She's a liar. I don't believe it. - Why don't you ask him, sweetheart? - Imam... - Here's the certificate. Liar, bastard. Let's go. Is this true? - Divorce her, son. - You shut your mouth, you old hag. Shut up. Divorce her. Wash away your shame... or I'll disown you. When he first came here, he was a ragged country bumpkin. I made a man out of him, with my money. I can buy all of you with my money. Have pity. You're as old as his mother. God will punish you. What a shame, son. - Wait. - Leave me. - You're not leaving. - Yes I am. I'll show you. I'll ruin you. Let go of me. Pull! Pull! Pull! I killed her. I delivered you from her. I delivered you from her evil. You're lost. I was lost long ago. Take him away from here. Away from this hell. Save the poor man from my fate. Let's go. Let's leave. Shafaat, Shafaat. THE END SUBTITLES BY KANAFANI
