And in the second car, the younger Hosein was sitting between two detectives in the back seat with a coat over his head. -I think what surprised us when we saw the brothers and spoke to them, they were unusual. It became evident that they were not ... certainly not ... professional criminals. -The two men have stayed here at Kingston police headquarters since 6:30 yesterday evening, according to the police, and their questioning has been surrounded by an aura of unusual secrecy. So far, I understand those inquiries have not been very productive, and apart from giving their names and some personal background details, the two men have not been able to help very much. -Well, Bill Smith did the interrogation himself with Joe Minus. It's totally... Unimaginable. I wouldn't give it any credence whatsoever. -I used to say, "Let me get to them," when they had them. "I'll make them tell where my mother is." "Oh, we do everything," they'd say, "we do everything, but nothing that shows." That's what the police would say, Smith and Minus. -What did they say? -"We do," otherwise they were saying, "Yes, we torture them, but mustn't show." "Get them by the balls," I said, "You let ... I'll do it." I mean, I really said that to them! And they would say, "We do; we we've done everything, but they won't speak." [Nizamodeen] -I spent a lot of time with the brothers. I took them back and forth to court from Brixton Prison, more than probably anybody else. The van stopped in ... in the yard at Brixton Prison. ♪♪ The only time I'd seen any of them snap.

Charge was that, between the 29th of December and the 6th of January, they murdered Mrs. Muriel McKay, and further charged that they demanded by menaces £1 million from Mr. Alick McKay for the return of his wife. -The common view in the community, as I knew it, was, people thought it was ... it was utterly incredible, and that it was more than likely that other people, white seasoned criminals, might have been involved, and those two were taking the rap for that. So it seemed to me such a kamikaze thing. And the idea that you could pull off something ... a heist as massive as that ... seemed to us to be totally airy-fairy, really. -When the brothers were arrested, a lot of thinking was, "Well, they must be more than them." And they were members of the family living in London ... of the Hosein brothers. One of them was a brother who was really investigated for some time. Adam Hosein. But, um, his alibi stood up. ♪♪ -I went down there, it was really a very extraordinary meeting, extraordinary situation, because the police could get nothing out of the two men, and Smith said to me, it's as if they pulled shutters down on their mind. And I decided to act for the younger brother, Nizamodeen. -Mum said that she looked even where police hadn't looked. She was looking. Hollow tree underneath the dog's bed, but there was nothing, nothing at all that gave her any inkling that they had actually killed her. -100 police officers searched and searched and found nothing. Mrs. McKay could not be found. -I had just read a trashy American whodunit in which the murder victim was fed to the pigs. So I said to one of the policemen there about this story, et cetera. So the next day and there were people sifting with sticks, whatever, through the pile of slurry. And, "Had she been fed to the pigs?" started. And just a throwaway remark for me has sort of went down in history. -What happened with the body, we don't know. -M3... [Indistinct] M3. -This is M3 speaking again. -This is the M3, we've contacted you last week. -Hey, who am I talking to? -I wanted to get to the truth; I wanted to hear the tapes, and they were happy to play the tapes to me.

Did they come into the country to do this? -The judiciary also thought it was an un-British kind of crime, and certainly the prosecution made a lot of that too.

There was nothing other than the forensic to prove it. -The body of evidence that went to the court and that the prosecution put to the jury was substantial but inconclusive.

He was aware of what he was doing. We wanted to show that he was pushed into something, dominated by somebody else. And so Nizam made some admissions ... when his brother couldn't reach him or get in touch with him. -It's a good defense, isn't it? He was a weak character, you could see that by looking at him.

And she had a look, and she pulled out some jewelry. -The police want anyone who's been offered for sale jewelry by men of Indian descent to come forward immediately and help them with the further inquiries in this case. -She said, "And I took her in to visit Arthur, and I said to him, 'You are guilty, because I've got something in my bag, and you know what it is, I found it behind the bar'," and she said to me, "That's the first time I've ever seen a Black person go white."

I've said that it's inconclusive, I can't tell one way or the other whether it was written by Arthur or not. Equally, it could have been written by another person. With the examples that I've seen, I'm more inclined to agree with the defense's case. -The data that we have indicate that we're dealing with an older individual, older than Nizam would have been at the time that the ransom calls were made. My strong feeling is that where we're dealing with more than one speaker in the calls. That means there are three individuals involved.

I think they were either commissioned to do it or they were the middlemen who then commissioned someone to do it. They could have come clean, they could have told what they knew. Why didn't they try and do that? And the answer for me has to be that there were other people involved.

Arthur and Nizam were there in Madame Tussaud's, standing in front of the pretend prison cells. That was quite a shock, actually. -Looking back on it, I suppose there was a certain demonization. I mean, there was unquestioned sort of prejudice in Britain, and we lived in a very different world. And the fact that they had ... that the people who've been accused of this crime were not white probably played an element in the public's view that they got the right people, and probably the police view they got the right people.
