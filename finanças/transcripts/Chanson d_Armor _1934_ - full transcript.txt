Presents a film restored in 2013 using a nitrate copy and a safety duplicate Belonging to the Cin?math?que francaise. The nitrate copy had been printed from the now misplaced original nitrate negative, and the duplicate was printed in 1986 using this nitrate copy. These elements have been digitized in 2K resolution, the sound being digitally restored. This project has been carried out thanks to the support of the Cinemath?que de Bretagne and "Quest-France".

Her head broken in her bosom Mona weeps by the brook Heavy tears running from her eyes For her lover has left her Soon the troubled water Shall flow lightly along the stream But your head shall remain filled with sorrow All your life, O poor girl For alas! the love of so many a young heart Is like the oat hull At the very moment when it seems the strongest It is blown away by the wind For alas! the love of so many a young heart Is like the oat hull At the very moment when it seems the strongest It is blown away by the wind Jesus, how great Is the rapture of the soul When it arrives before God And enters His love Jesus, how great Is the rapture of the soul When it arrives before God And enters His love Time seems to be shod And sorrows seem to be mild When day and night I think Of the joys of paradise Subtitles: Marc Ulrich (Copyright) La Cin?math?que francaise - 2013
