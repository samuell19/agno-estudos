I've been a teacher for 25 years. I have won many awards. I have created many doctors and engineers. A good teacher serves as a guide and beacon to society. I have always strived… to be an honest cop. I've never accepted a bribe in my life. The phones haven't been working for the past two hours. The service providers are perplexed. They're trying to solve it. I'm sure this is a conspiracy. But I don't understand why anyone would do it. Suresh, they've messed up every single phone in the city. What's wrong with the system? I just made an international call. -Try again. -Are you sure? YASHODA RESIDENCE The phone's working again. It's a problem if it works and a problem if it doesn't. Tell me, Lalitha. What? Who? My son? Who told you? Stop blabbering! Lalitha just told me that our son has murdered two people. It's a lie. Right, Lalitha can't be trusted. Not two… he's murdered more than four people. What?! Get me some coffee. Krishna Kumar? That's impossible! He's not a killer. Hello? Apparently, it's five. What's going on? Add a bit more sugar to the coffee. I'll believe you if you tell me that the petrol prices have fallen. But this is rubbish! -Hurry! Get to the spot immediately! -Okay, sir. This place was like a temple. Its doors hadn't been closed for the past 25 years. They locked it, extinguished the lamp that had been burning eternally for 25 years! How can Krishna spare them? Let him do it. Sir, he has killed a police officer. -It's the seventh murder. -What are you saying? My son has killed seven people?! What are you doing? Sir, one of the victims is a teacher. He was an award-winning teacher. YASHODA RESIDENCE A cop, an engineer and an IT professional. He's done this right after he was released from jail. Krishna Kumar has done this?! I don't believe it. He wanted to be a scientist. I wanted him to be something else. But time and God had other plans for him. Kashi Pathi, let's go. I am not coming. I will take care of the house. Okay. Stay at home. Krishna! You have murdered people! I prayed to the Lord for seven years for a child! Why did you do this? I didn't commit a crime, Mom. It was just a cleanup. A FEW MONTHS AGO… This is Sangramgarh. In the north, we have Uttargarh. NORTH SANGRAMGARH In the south, we have Dakshingarh. SOUTH SANGRAMGARH The people from both these regions used to live together like one big family. It is believed that Goddess Shakti was born in Dakshingarh, and Lord Mahadev was born in Uttargarh. The Goddess was brought to Lord Mahadev in Uttargarh in a chariot for a festival called "Celebrating Women" for three days every year. All the women from Dakshingarh who moved to Uttargarh after marriage are invited to this festival. It's called "Celebrating Women." We have grand feasts on those three days. We have gatherings where their problems or family issues are discussed and resolved. In Dakshingarh, the birth of a girl child is considered a blessing. This is the tree-planting ceremony. Every time a girl child is born in this region, they plant 111 saplings. Eleven of these are palm trees. By the time the girl turns 21, the trees and the region prosper and yield wealth. The girls who were once thought to be a burden now parade the streets like fairies. In Dakshingarh, the birth of a girl is a celebration, and so is her wedding. They wilt in pain if anything happens to their girl child. One day, a girl from Dakshingarh who was married into Uttargarh, hung herself from the tree that she had fondly nurtured after she had a fight with her husband. This led to chaos and tension between the two regions. Oh, God! No marriage alliances have happened between these two regions ever since. Now, if someone hits a girl or someone from her family… Krishna, they hit our groom! Hey! Let struggles shape you You are a diamond in the rough I only stand for what is right Let your love win the hearts of the people I only stand for what is right Respect and love come Only to those who do good A man who considers others a brother Is one who is revered Your entitlement and rights will offend the unrighteous Let me be honest I am a happy-go-lucky guy I only stand for what is right I only stand for what is right Let struggles shape you You are a diamond in the rough Do not let success overwhelm you Stay grounded, my friend Do nothing to hurt others Or bring them pain Crushing and controlling To rule you Do not let anyone subdue you Let just the heart rule you That is where God resides With the one who flashes like a spear Do you need to compete Your brothers are always with you Just holler, my friend Your entitlement and rights will offend the unrighteous Let me be honest I am a happy-go-lucky guy I only stand for what is right I only stand for what is right Let struggles shape you You are a diamond in the rough Your entitlement and rights will offend the unrighteous Let me be honest I am a happy-go-lucky guy I only stand for what is right I only stand for what is right NORTH SANGRAMGARH HISAMPUR Shoot me. Just shoot me. Not just me… No one can stop you. The minister, the judge, the collector, the SP… they're all here to congratulate you. You have power, wealth and fame. You're a great lobbyist. Getting a phone call from the CM shouldn't be a big deal for you. For me, it's more important… to get birthday wishes from you. Wish me, darling. One day, you are going to regret this. Mark my words. Happy birthday. Goodbye, my wife. Hello. Thank you. -My best wishes. -Thank you, Dad. -Happy birthday, my son-in-law. -Thank you, my father-in-law. Where's Sameera? -She wished me first but she had to leave. -I see. -Did you everyone eat? -Yes, sir. Sit down. SOUTH SANGRAMGARH BADARI Yashoda. -Will you have something? -Sure. Wait. Where's your son? He's reading a spy novel. He's on the last chapter. Apparently, the climax is thrilling. It's alright. Call him. He won't let him read a novel in peace! My dear, your father is calling you outside. He's fallen asleep while reading. Just wake him up! I won't wake him up. He must be hungry, dear. Come and eat-- Where is he? What? He isn't in his room! Oh, my! My eyesight seems to have become weak. My dear! It looked like he was sleeping on his bed. Where did he go? My dear! Your father wants to see you! There's a cultural program in the neighboring town. I think that's where he's gone. Where are you off to? To the cultural program! "You can't go there." "I need to go there, Mom." "Your dad will scold you." "Please handle him, Mom." "No, please don't." "It will be alright, Mom." "Don't put me on the spot." "It's okay, Mom." "It's okay." "Hey, drink water." He's a great dancer! Partner in crime! Let him have fun for a day. We don't get along with the people of that town. Why did he go there? He said he won't say a word. He'll just be a mute spectator. Who? Your son? Call him back immediately. He didn't answer the call. He'll answer it if you call him. Put him on speakerphone. You've become a cynical man. Mother is the greatest gift on earth She's a goddess I had told him to set a song about father's love as his caller tune instead. But he never listens to me! He didn't answer the call. My gut tells me that something bad is about to happen over there. Move! Sir, welcome. Move. Get the chair. Buddy, come here. -Hey. -Yes? It's an important call. The music's too loud. Hey, move! Move! Hey, stop the music! Tell me. The driver's mother says that her son didn't elope. She suspects you. She's going to the collector's office to file a complaint. Where is she? Play the music! What's the point? His wife eloped with the driver. I left my keys in the car, Baby. Wait a minute. -Brother! Dance later. Listen to me. -Yes? My name is Trishul Daari. -What did you say? Trishul? -No, not Trishul. -Trishul Daari. -Okay. I was so excited to go in there, -I left my keys inside the car. -Okay. -If you could lend me the bike-- -Do you have spare keys at home? Yes, they are with Baby. If someone could give me a ride on the bike… I can't. -Let's go, they are playing the song. -Listen. No one needs to go anywhere. We can unlock the car. -Call her. -How can we unlock the car? We're getting late. Call her. Hello, Baby. I am with a guy right now. He says that he can unlock the car. -Who is that crazy fellow? -What? How can he open it without the keys? Good gracious! Ask her to video-call us! -Video call? -Hurry up. -Code word 1040. -Hey! It's 2240. Are these guys ATM thieves? She's here. Hello. Wait, I'll give him the phone. -Here. -Baby? I see. I am not Baby. -Aarthi. -It's a lovely name. I am the crazy fellow. Can we check if I am crazy? How? How to open the door? Look at that! You'll scare her. Do you have the key? Got it? Hey, hold this. Take the key, place it below the phone, and press it. Do it when I tell you. Okay? Okay. Alright, press it now. Press it. Press-- Press it properly. -Do it right. -Don't break it. Is it okay now? Are you placing and pressing it correctly? Forget it. I will push the car. Hey. Both of us need to work smartly for this to work. But she doesn't seem to be smart. Hey. Are you crazy? How dare you say that! Good. You unlocked it! But how? Am I crazy? No, you're a scientist. You are not bad either. -Okay. That's enough. -Good night. -"Good night." -You exhausted my data pack. -Bye, Trishul. -Yes. -We'll leave, bro. -Have fun! Who's calling at this hour? -Hello, Mom. -My dear, did you drink water? -I did. -Did you urinate? Mom, stop it. You need to drink lots of water. It will dissolve your kidney stones. They dissolved six months ago! Hey, your father knows that you went to the cultural program. -How? Oh, no! -He saw the CCTV footage. Be careful. I'm hiding from the cameras as I speak. Oh, no! Your father caught me. -Try and save the situation. -Yashoda. Why do you look terrified? Did you reach on time? Yes, we missed about seven or eight songs. I left after the first two songs. It's too obscene. It'll make you angry. -Come back. -Fine. It's okay, darling. Father-in-law, why aren't you asleep yet? How can I sleep? My daughter eloped with the driver. She must be caught. I want to ask her what was wrong with my upbringing. I want to strangle her to death! Sorry. Father-in-law. Please! Go and get some sleep. I am off to bed. We stopped celebrating the "Celebrating Women" festival after Phoolmathi hung herself. The women who moved to other towns after marriage want to know what's their fault and why we aren't celebrating it anymore. Shouldn't we invite them and ask them about their well-being? Minister, ask him to accept that he was the one who murdered her. We won't convict him. You just need to accept it. That's it. How can we accept a crime that we didn't commit? So, what's the conclusion? What conclusion?! Hereafter, we won't get our girls married to boys from their region. -Good! -But… You won't get a single vote from Dakshingarh! Hey! You should watch your mouth! -Ask them! -Stop. Don't interrupt elders -when they're talking! -Krishna. This discussion is pointless! Can you put him behind bars? Is there anything that we can't do? What are you waiting for? Go, wear your coat! We must adhere to the rules and conduct the festival. What should we do? We can explain the significance of this festival to the collector. I am sure he will allow it. Usually, we go to our region's boundary and hand over the chariot to them. We'll tell them it can't be done this year. We can say that we can't send Shiva. But how can we tell them that we can't send Shakti? She was born there. Their function is to honor their daughters and sons-in-law. And Shiva and Parvati are the first couple. They won't agree. We'll make them. Son-in-law… your region must win. Did you see that? Professor Raj Verma seems to be raking it in these days. Look at the grandeur. -Hey, Malathi! -Hi. You're here with your gang! The professor must've invited you all! -Happy birthday. -Hi, sir. Hey, Krishna. -Hey! How have you been? -I am well. -Where's your dad? -He'll come later. -See you. -Bye. Mom… the key is in your hand. Place it correctly and press it. How do I do it? It's a normal key. -There are no buttons on this key. -Connect it to the bottom! Hey, that's the charging port. Hello! What are you doing? Why? I misplaced the key. The spare key is at home. So, we're trying to open it with the help of 4G. I see! Which crazy fellow gave you this idea? We've unlocked a four-wheeler with the same idea. This is a two-wheeler. It's a crazy idea. Hey, crazy fellow. Aren't you the one who gave me this idea? You were acting as if you did not know who we are. I didn't know for sure if I knew you guys. I couldn't see your face clearly the other day. -Really? -Yes. You can't unlock it like that. Two-wheelers cannot be unlocked like that. -Right. -These are the types of rumors that go viral on social media. Cars have sensors. Do you have a sensor on your bike? How can we unlock it? -Let me think. -Code 0810. Hey. It's 2010. What code? Oh, God! Why did you break it? -My parents will kill me! -Don't you want to go home? It's getting late. -"0908." -Hey! It's 2108. Hold it. -It's just a job of cutting and pasting. -Oh, no. Ready. Just fixing it. Let's try it. You broke the lock and cut off the wire. What should I say to my folks? Don't you want to go home? Come on-- Aarthi, is there a problem? -No. They are helping us. -Friend? -Bodyguard? -Let's go. Love. -Love?! -Hey, shut up. He's in love. I see. It is one-sided! -Can't you keep quiet? -Sorry. You should watch your mouth! -It's ready. You may leave. -Start it. Shall we leave? -Leave. -Wait! Won't you thank me? You should apologize. Oh, sorry. -You think one sorry is sufficient? -Very… sorry. Hey, stop it! -Guys, leave! I said, leave! -Ride carefully. -Leave. Get going, will you? -Good night! NORTH SANGRAMGARH DEWARA -Welcome. -Sister! -How are you? -I am fine. It's a special celebration. -You should definitely come. -Okay. -Bless me, Aunt. -God bless you. I am 80 years old. My husband passed away 16 years ago. But I've witnessed and helped the women bring glory to our region! Apparently, people of Uttargarh want to create problems. Be careful. All of you must come to the celebration. When is your second daughter getting married? We will plan it after the Utsav. A.R. KRISHNA KUMAR ADVOCATE Aarthi, the guy who fixed the bike yesterday… has dropped his visiting card. He did it with the intention to speak with me. We need to know what he thinks of us. I can't get through to him. Hey. The number has nine digits. The last digit is missing. One, two, three, four… Oh, yes! The last digit must be between zero and nine. Simple! -Hello. -Is it Krishna Kumar? Jinnah. Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Hello. Oh, God. Which one of my granddaughters are you? Why are you so eager to talk to him? Why would I be eager? Is he a superstar? M.C. DENTAL COLLEGE AND HOSPITAL -Hello. -Krishna Kumar? Yeah, tell me. I am his father. -It was his father. -Strange! -Krishna Kumar? -I am his mother. Who's this? Client? It was his mother. Hey… what's going on? -You should definitely come. -We will be there. -Do come. -Sure. Hello. A.R. Krishna Kumar, MA, BL. -Criminal lawyer! -A lawyer for criminals. Who is it? Why did you leave your visiting card behind? Who are you, ma'am? Do you remember last night? Last night… I helped a few girls. -You… -Oh! Is helping girls your profession? Oh, it's you! From the Vivekananda Cross Street! -How are you? -Hello. I am the one you met at the birthday party. Aarthi. Outside the hotel! Are you the one who was riding the bike? I am the one who was sitting behind. Sorry, I gave the card to the girl who was riding the bike. Put her on the line. Hello. Yes, tell me. Why did you leave your card? So that you could call me if you face a problem when you ride it. But you're questioning my character. What? You thought you could help us by giving us a nine-digit number! My friend was trying really hard to reach you-- Quiet! Shut up! Why were you trying so hard? Are you the one who rode the bike or the one who sat behind? I am the one who rode it. Sorry, sister. I left the card to speak to the girl who was sitting behind. Give her the phone. -Tell him I don't like to talk. -I know that I'm on the speakerphone. I like to talk to you. You're being cocky because we're talking on the phone. Can you say the same in person? I can do that. Give me the time and the place. I will come. I will let you know when I feel like it. Do tell me. I'm in your town. We're here to invite people to the "Celebrating Women" festival. Your mother was born in our town. -Shall I come home? -Home? -Yes. -He says he'll come home. Let's go. You should definitely come. -Okay? -Yes, of course. -Careful. -Please sit. -Please continue. I will join you soon. -Please sit. They look like they've come here to look for a bride. Might be. Could be. Where is the girl? She might be behind some pillar. The people here are saying this event won't take place. But you've come here to invite us. We will come if it happens. Your daughter seems to be pious. -Yes. -Your home is filled with God's pictures. So, she is the client. Father-in-law. Son-in-law. Have the police managed to trace them? They have. I don't know what to tell you. Their phone signals were traced till they got to Maharashtra. After that… they have… destroyed their SIM cards. Maharashtra?! YASHODA RESIDENCE MAY THE SOULS OF GOVINDRAJ, PADMINI AND MALATHI REST IN PEACE -No… -Malathi! Malathi, what have you done? -I have nothing to live for! -Malathi! I believe he was deeply in debt. He could not repay it. No. His daughter was in a relationship with someone. The girl had to undergo a couple of abortions. She was really naive. What are you saying? SUCCESS IS A MINDSET LIVE LIFE ON YOUR OWN TERMS Krishna! Dad was not weakhearted. I'm sure he didn't do this. Someone instigated him to end his life! After Dad, it was Uncle Govind who used to always come forward to do anything for the people of this soil. We didn't organize the "Celebrating Women" festival… because of the death of his entire family. Your girl has eloped with her lover. -We're sure. -No, sir! We traced their phones. Their last known location was in Maharashtra. We couldn't trace their phones after they reached Maharashtra. They have absconded after destroying their SIM cards. The postmortem report clearly says… that the family has committed suicide. The girl was fooling around and having abortions. -Sir… -Hey! Mind your language! Scoundrels like you… Hello! -Let's go. -Hey! Lawyer! Brother, I need to talk to you in private. Malathi didn't tell you anything? Any lover? But she had many aspirations. -Lawyer sir. -Yes? Come. Hey! What a surprise! Come in, please sit. Just one minute. I'll be with you soon. -Fine. I will let you know. -Okay. -Do you have the SOS app? -What's that? The app has been launched by the police department for the safety of women. I will install it for you. Just keep it on the home screen for your safety. In case of an emergency, just press it once. It will alert the police control room and an important member of your family. This is more important than TikTok or Instagram. -Okay. -Here. -See you around. -Thank you. Bye. -Please come. -Won't you install it for us? The app was launched a long time ago! Give me your phone. What was that girl's problem? I'm not at liberty to discuss it. Yeah. My first gift. -Thank you. -What's this? You'll only do it for her?! And what about me? I've downloaded the SOS app for many girls-- I mean… sisters. I've downloaded the SOS app for many sisters. -Just a minute. It's Mom. -Alright. -Mom. -Did you eat? -Not yet. -Why? Did you drink water? -Yes. -Did you urinate? Mom! Mom, can I call you back? Okay. Miss you, dear. Miss you too. -Done. -Thanks, brother. You talk about various apps and seem savvy about technology. But sound was leaking from your phone. Do you know that? What do you mean? I heard your mom asking if you took a leak! Why, Yashoda? If you hear how much my mother loves to blabber… When are you taking me home? First, I need to tell my mother about you. I'll do it soon. I got a small gift for you. Keep it on the table. It will look nice. Thank you. What's this? Your visiting card with a ten-digit phone number. That's nice. Okay. Bye. Hey, please stay for lunch. Yeah, I am hungry. We'll have lunch together only after we become good friends! Really? My beloved My beloved My beloved My beloved My heart melts When you look at me closely My heart melts When you talk with such charm Can I ask you something? Will you abandon me? I am willing to make promises I will never break your heart, dear You are my life You are my soul I will renounce the world To be with you My heart melts When you look at me closely My heart melts When you talk with such charm Lover Lover You are my life My identity is from you My beloved Should I hide you In my heart and worship you? You are my Lord I shall follow you like a wanderer You will be the path that I tread From head to toe, I will shower you with my love If only you take me In your embrace It is my desire to make you happy From dawn to dusk each day When I look into your beautiful eyes All I see is my reflection Let's drown in the ocean of love My heart melts When you look at me closely My heart melts When you talk with such charm Can I ask you something? Will you abandon me? I am willing to make promises I will never break your heart, dear -You are my life -You are my life -You are my soul -You are my soul -I will renounce the world to be with you -I will renounce the world to be with you Lover Lover Lover Lover My heart melts Have you seen this girl, sir? No. -This girl? -Sorry, sir. -We haven't seen her. -We haven't seen her. -Krishna, wait a minute. -Okay. Ragini, can you help me wear a sari? I have to attend a reception. Sari… I don't know how to drape a sari. Thanks, Mom. -Ask her if she knows how to cook. -Hello. You know how to cook, right? -I only know how to eat. -She doesn't. -It's okay, dear. -It's okay. -Krishna, listen. -Yeah? Buy four-five expensive suits and gift them to me as a surprise. Okay? -Why four or five? -I have never gotten her anything. Buy her one suit or two at the most. -It's okay! -This is too much! I can't hear you. Hello. Yes, tell me. I can hear you. Is it strange that I am asking you to get me a gift? -No-- -Of course! -Hey, give me that. -Oh, no. Sorry. What are you doing? Oh, no. I forgot to eat panipuri. Excuse me. Give me two plates of panipuri, please. She's so cute. Dad. -What? -Hello. Yes. Do you have cash? Aarthi. I don't have a penny. I donated all the cash I had at the temple. Can you send me some cash? I didn't repay you that day, right? Let me Google Pay you. Okay, you do that. I'll order another plate of panipuri. -Brother, one more. -Sure. She was fasting, that's the reason she is hungry. Aarthi, do you go to the temple every day? Yes, I just stepped out of the temple. The holy offering of fried chickpeas was delicious. I love the food they serve at the temple. I always stand in the queue and ask for two servings. Is there a temple near your house? -Yes, there is! -Mom, stop it! -Give it to me, Mom! -Listen. Don't tell anyone about it. It's a secret. There's nothing left for me to say! I got the money. -Thank you. -Okay. -Bye! -Okay. Bye. -Mom! -Give it to me! -Dad-- -Do you want to see the girl's photo? AARTHI -She's from Uttargarh! -Yes. Isn't she beautiful, Dad? In this case, your taste is a bit poor. It's mediocre. But if you like her, it's fine. What's mediocre for me is super for you. And what's super for me is mediocre for you. Hang on. What's he saying? He's calling me mediocre. This is the only time you're right about your mother. The problem is… there have been no marriage alliances between the two regions for the past two years. If we now talk about one now, it will lead to a big problem. What can we do? Yes! What if we say that it's an arranged marriage? What an idea! But who's gonna lead the discussion? Kashi Pathi will do it. He's good at lying. -What? -I meant, laying the path. Homophones can be confusing. I see! -You want me to be a matchmaker. -No, bro. We want you to be the peacemaker between the two regions. NORTH SANGRAMGARH PAMARGANJ Hail Lord Shiva. -Welcome. -Hello, dear. How are you, Ganpat? I was told that Kadak Dhaarii makes fantastic instant coffee. I just came here for a cup of coffee. -Make a cup of coffee. -Who? My daughter? -Yes. -You're being oddly sweet today. What is the reason? Well, you might get mad when I tell you why I'm here. Kadak, his expression has changed. Yeah. He looks like a monkey who has eaten ginger! -You tell us. -Yeah, right. The people from Dakshingarh dumped you on me like a sack of coconuts! -What? -Hey! -You know our head Vasudev Rai, right? -Yes. His son, Krishna Kumar… -The lawyer? -Yes. He wants his son to marry your daughter. We checked the list of the girls from this town. Your girl is in the Top ten. -Oh, really? -Yeah. Can you guess the rank of your girl? Maybe ninth or tenth. No! Number one! Really? Talk about fate! Even sawdust can pass for sugar in a town with no sugar. He saw your daughter in person. There have been no marriage alliances between our towns for the past two years. Let's break that tradition! -Break the rules. -Yes! Do you want people to ostracize us? Keep quiet! Some people might be jealous, but most of the people in town will be happy. Dad, I don't want to marry anyone right now. I will finish my medical course first. And marrying a stranger from Dakshingarh… -No. -What are you saying? You always come up with excuses! If you don't marry him, you will end up with some boy from our town! It's a wonderful family. It's a blessing that they are approaching us. -Tell them that we are interested. -Okay. Do you, at least, have his photo? No, but how about a video call? There has been no marriage alliance between these towns for two years. How can you break this tradition? He's our enemy. And he's a lawyer as well. They can turn the truth into a lie and the other way around. It's second nature to him. He's Anand. You know him, right? -He's the owner of this hotel. -Yes. I know. He will soon be venturing into politics. He has seen your girl. He likes her. He wishes to marry her. Don't think too much. You won't find a better groom. Anand, see off your father-in-law in your car. YASHODA RESIDENCE I'm glad that they didn't say no after the engagement. -I'm heading to the court. -Okay. -Hello. -A.R. Krishna Kumar. Brother, I need to talk to you in person. Who is this? I'm Moni. I am in trouble. I want to meet you. Come to my office. Okay, I'll be there. Okay. -What happened? -What's going on? -Suresh, what's wrong? -Hey, what happened? An accident. I think the girl died on the spot. Move! Did you call for an ambulance? -Sister! -Open your eyes. Open your eyes. Say something. Call for an ambulance. Look at me. Don't worry. -Phone… -Yes. Get her phone. -Phone-- -Give her some water! You will be fine. -Here. Drink some water. -Drink water. Ma'am. Here's your phone. Unlock it. I'll call your family. Moni… Brother. Moni? Yes. -I am in trouble. -Come to my office. -Brother! -Tell me. Tell me. Moni! Moni… get up. Moni! Moni! -Take her to the hospital. Pick her up. -Pick her up. Move! -What happened? -Accident. -Who is this girl? -She's my student. She wasn't wearing a helmet and was using her phone. -It's a hit-and-run case. -Leave. Is she dead or alive? How dare you touch the corpse? Put it down! -Go. -Krishna, leave it. let's go. Brother! Brother! It wasn't an accident! Brother… They killed her. We have checked all the CCTV footage like you had asked us. It does not look like an accident. And… she was talking to the professor when the accident happened. We have traced their phones. Their last know location was in Maharashtra. I need to talk to you in private. -Tell me. -Don't tell anyone about this accident. We will check whose vehicle it was. -Come home. -Fine. I wanted an update about my daughter-- Sir! Sir, my daughter Moni's case… Your daughter's professor said that she was not wearing a helmet and was using her phone. The investigation is over! I don't want to see you here anymore. Stop entertaining everyone! Don't you have a job? -Send her away! -Yes, sir. Krishna. Yes, Dad? I've heard that you're planning to kidnap that girl at the Kalash Utsav. What's the plan? Oh no, Dad! That's just a rumor. -So, you did not plan anything? -No. It is nothing of the sort. -You haven't! -What?! We did. We are going to abduct her! Dad, there's no need to do that. Well, then you can forget about that girl. Mom! It's okay, dear. Here, drink this. Sit. Not all love stories see a conclusion. And the feeling when you find out that the girl you love is not happy with her marriage is really painful. So, get ready to kidnap her! They'll claim that I've shown my true colors as a lawyer. She's marrying into a prosperous family. Let her go. It's nothing but a prosperous well. -You need to do me a favor. -Tell me. -Tell her parents that… -Yes? on the day of the Maha Kalash Puja, the boys are planning to kidnap the girl. Tell them that my father has asked them to be careful. Got it? I don't get it. Your father is asking you to kidnap the girl. Your mother is encouraging it. And you are asking me to inform her parents about it! I don't understand your family. That will help me protect my father's reputation. -Oh, wow. -We can say that we had warned them. Isn't it risky? Yes, it is. And that's what makes it extraordinary. Krishna Kumar loves thrill! I'm gonna lose my mind. -Kashi. -What, you don't want me to go? -No. I will come with you. -Okay. We'll be in a strong position if I come with you. -Listen. -Yes? We'll be in a stronger position if I come with you. -How, Mom? -Mom of a lawyer! -Come on, darling! -Great! -It's okay, dear. -Really? You too? -How are you doing, Ganpat? -Hey, stop! We've stopped drinking coffee from the day you came to our house. You may leave. We are not here to have coffee. We're here to discuss something important. Things are going well. Mind your business. We know how you tried to turn a love marriage into an arranged marriage! Listen, there is a puja at the temple-- I know. -We've donated Rs. 3000-- -No, add Rs 500 to it. I have paid Rs. 3500! I have the receipt as well. -You may leave! -Listen. Our boys have planned to kidnap your daughter during the celebration. What?! We have come here to warn you about it. Please don't attend the Kalash Utsav. Who are you to tell us not to come? That temple is at the boundary of our town. We will come and we will bring our daughter! I will come with my family. I'll seek blessings with the shower of the holy water. You can watch us eat the meal as well! Ganpat, you can have the meal, but don't end up saying yes to this marriage alliance. Suppose… my son kidnaps your daughter, we'll not send her away if he brings her home as our daughter-in-law. We just can't. -If our boy manages to nab her… -Hey, go inside. it'll totally be worth the effort. Who is he to nab Aarthi? Before he does it… you'll kidnap him. The vehicle that hit her belongs to Anand's friend. We have all the evidence we need. Should I ask Moni's mother to file a complaint? Not now. Let her think that it's an accident. We don't need to talk about it to Moni's mother. The temple festivities are happening after 20 years. MAHA KALASH UTSAV DAY 07:02 A.M. But Uncle cannot attend the festivities. Who says I won't attend it? I will attend it with my daughter! I was thinking I would chat with you and skip it. But now I am tempted to attend the festival. -It will be entertaining-- -To hell with your entertainment! -The joker is here. -Hey! Why aren't you ready yet? Oh, come on! That boy's family came home and warned us that they'll kidnap her. -And you want us to go there? -Hey, Kadak Dhaarii! Will he be able to do it when I am around? Do you think it's a piece of cake? Get ready! Well, that's your fate. Let's go. Sure, I will be there in five to ten minutes. Sure. Please. Bye. Why are you working today? It's a 200-crore deal. How can I forgo it? Fine. Go. Baby's future is in my hands. I'm not gonna let them kidnap her! Hey, what's going on? A lot is going on, Uncle. My brother-in-law is useless! I have not come here alone. I have a group of ten men! You're gonna see our knives and axes in action today! -How do I look? -What is she wearing? -A ghagra choli. -Why? Do you want her to tuck it and run comfortably? -Should I ask her to wear a chudidaar. -Why? To run faster? Ask her to wear a swimsuit! Ask her to wear a proper sari so that she won't be able to run fast. Don't interrupt when elders are talking! Oh, God. The elders are talking. Is he sugar walking? I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know why they are walking. Why are you wearing a dhoti? I'm off to the temple. How can I forget my tradition? They will be chasing you. Wear your pants. It's a dhoti that will stay in place. I can fold it comfortably and run. It will be a hit. Not just a hit, it should be a blockbuster. Thank you, Mother India! There she comes. She's beautiful. She looks stunning. Beautiful. Morbius. -Is that the right term? -Okay? What's this? Why is she dressed like a bride? If she wears a sari, she will look like a bride! Let's go! -Boys-- -Get ready, boys! -Get lost! Move! Come! -Let's go. All the best, dear. -Be careful, dear. -I need your blessings. -Protect the family's honor. -Yes, Mom. Don't forget. The auspicious time is 9:30-10:00. Rock it! You'll never see a family as strange as this one! HAIL LORD SHIVA MAHA KALASH PUJA WELCOME CM BHAIRAV SINGH Uncle, you know what? We have chosen this spot for Operation Baby. We can see the seven kalash from here. If he tries to kidnap Baby, on this side, there is a kalash. On this side, there is a shrine. On that side, there is a place for offering food. So, if he tries to run, our team will take care of everything. Come on. Stop. Where's our towel? Please. Everyone, be alert. Over. Boss, Krishna Kumar has made a grand entry. Why are you giving him respect? Does he pay you? I hope this ritual will yield a good result. Tell me. What?! If you see him anywhere near this temple, kill him! Can we hit him right here? If we hit him here… how will my uncle know about my bravery and valor? And if he holds Aarthi's hand and runs in public, will any guy marry her? No fool will. This fool will. Thank you. Hey, where is Ragini? I don't know. Hello! Greetings to all devotees! You are requested to take care of your belongings. There may be thieves around. Girls and their parents, please be careful. You never know when they might strike. Look, the thief is announcing it himself! Yeah. MAHADEV Hey! You told us he wants to kidnap the girl, but he is serving food at the feast. -Serving food? -Yes. Hey… eat well. If I eat well, how will I run and catch you? Well, you won't be able to do that anyway. Moron! What's this? I thought you were going to get the girl, but you're serving food here! The greatest happiness lies in making others happy and witnessing their happiness. First, I will make you all happy… and then I will be happy. Isn't it a dialogue from Mr Amitabh Bachchan's movie? Really? I guess the same writer wrote this dialogue as well! -Really? -Yes. What were you doing there? I was hungry. I went to get a free meal. Give me that. He's sent this juice for you because you're fasting. How did he know that I was fasting? He asked me why you didn't come to eat, so I told him. Doofus! I'd told you to give me updates about him, and you are giving him updates about me?! Hey, Ragini! Come in! Happy birthday! Thank you. Just a minute. Nitin… ready? I am at the farmhouse. -Talk to her. -Okay. If they try to kidnap her, they'll have to kidnap three people. Why? -Why did I give them two towels? -Why? Super, Trishul! How dare you take your boss's name? You moron with noodle hair! Prem, we sent 20 people to nab him, and he has sent 50 lawyers to nab them. Oh, shit! He has nabbed our men! Send 400 men in two lorries from every direction. Go and serve them. Do you want anything? -How many? -Six hundred. Ask them if they're all hungry. This situation could blow up. Stop it. If you see a small problem as a big problem, it becomes a big problem. If you see a big problem as a small problem, it becomes a small problem. What do you think about this problem? -I don't even see it as a problem! -Right! Dad… the towel you had tied has come undone. Tie it well. You won't run away! I misjudged you. Now I trust you! Kadak Dhaarii, untie that knot! Why are you getting emotional? I don't trust her. Come on, tie it. Fine! I will tie it! Hey! MINISTER BHAIRAV SINGH Why are these catering boys coming here? Hey! Deflate the tires of all the vehicles that are parked in this area. Let me see how they take Baby away! What is this, Mr. Prem? We've completed such a huge deal. But you… Shall we go to my farmhouse? Everything is ready. Now? Fresh college girl. Now I get it. Go and deflate their tires. What's this? They are doing it themselves. Did we pay him to do it? I think something is gonna happen. I don't know what, but something's gonna happen! Why did you ask me to deflate our tires? If they escape in our car, we'll be held responsible for the whole thing. -Let's not risk it. -Correct. What do you like? The merry-go-round, ice cream or cotton candy? -What? -Cotton candy! Oh, cotton candy! Brother, give them two candies each. Here you go. Here, take it. -Here. -Give her one. Hey! What are they doing? They are eating cotton candy. -Okay. -One for me, please. If there is more, I'll get you one. It does not look like they are going to nab the girl. If they don't nab the girl… I will be extremely annoyed! I've told everyone about it. It'll be a shame if it doesn't happen. Hey! It's my niece's life! -Guys, ready? -Yes! Just make way for me to run. -Yes. -Okay? All the best, boss. -To the Almighty Mahadev… -Salutations! -All of you! To the Almighty Mahadev… -Salutations! -To the Almighty Mahadev… -Salutations! -To the Almighty Mahadev… -Salutations! -Look! It's the holy eagle! -Oh, yes! -Salutations to Lord Mahadev! -Fold your hands. We will find out the result in ten minutes. Why are you troubling the lawyers? Do you think you're above the law? -Stop these police atrocities! -Hey, let's go! -Hey! You… -Stop these police atrocities! You are being rude! -Watch your mouth! -You watch your mouth! -He raised his hand to me! -I'm warning you! I got it! -To the Almighty Mahadev… -Salutations! -Salutations to Lord Mahadev… -Salutations to Lord Mahadev… -Are you ready? -Salutations to Lord Mahadev… -Salutations to Lord Mahadev… -Salutations to Lord Mahadev… -All of you!

Let go of us! Salutations to Lord Mahadev. Give us Your blessing. -Krishna, Ragini is in trouble. -What happened? It's an SOS alert. She must be alright. I'll go and check on her. -Hey! -Oh my God! -Hey! -God! -Move! -Move! Move! -Hey! -Move! Let me through! -Move! -Hey! I am going with my friend, not with the girl! I will kill you if you try to stop me! Oh, God! Will someone tell me what's going on? They're married now! -Please do something! -Hey. Why are you announcing it to the whole world? Shut up! Remove that wedding chain and throw it away. It's embarrassing. Everyone is staring at us. Stop, Dad! It's an auspicious day, we're in Lord Mahadev's temple. In the midst of seven kalash, -with the shower of the sacred water! -Leave! -He's an incarnation of Lord Mahadev. -Leave! What the hell are you saying? -What? -Hey! Why are you so quiet? I am in shock. Let's go home! I'll deal with you later! Why are we running away after tying the wedding chain? Go! Hurry! The bike is ready for you. Come here! -Go! Go! -I'll handle the situation, go. -Hit them! Thrash them! -Don't let them through. Ragini! Brother! Brother! Hit her! Help me, brother… Brother… Brother… they are bad people. They have ruined the lives of many girls. Don't spare them. Brother… Okay, boss. Hey. Boss has asked us to kill her. Hey! We're all Prem's men! Think twice before you do anything! Leave her alone and run away! -Kill him! -Come. Hey, lawyer. Send her with them. Stay out of it. Really? Why? Listen to me. Leave her there. It's a love matter. Prem… are you trying to scare me? Yes. Go. Go to town. A minimum of 100 families-- No. A minimum of 500 families… will die. Not just her… we have videos of more than 500 girls like her. We will release them. I'm sure you can imagine the consequences. Hey! At the auspicious time of 10:10 a.m. tomorrow, we will release the videos. Lawyer, if you like the videos, then please like them, comment on them and share them. You'll be responsible for the deaths of their parents. You monster! And then no one will marry the girls… from your town. And then… I will put you behind bars. Or within 24 hours, I will close your chapter forever. The option that I choose… will depend on my mood. You, your gang, and your whole lineage… will regret touching this girl. Hey! When I am in the court, the judge is someone else. But at all other times… I am the judge myself! He stands strong Like the roots of a banyan tree He moves like the wind Yeah, watch out! As I redefine everything around here We've got ourselves a face-off A game that's on fire I cannot be bought I make my own decisions I come from a legacy That is known to destroy their enemies I'm really scared, brother. -They have intimidated everyone. -Please help me. Brother! I'm Prem! A FEW MONTHS AGO… You, your gang, and your whole lineage will regret touching this girl. You want us to kill Ragini because she knows everything. I get it. But the lawyer knows everything as well. What are we going to do about him? We'll kill him as well. -Uncle, it was a fantastic plan. -What? We thought they were serving free meals in the tent. But it turned out to be Krishna Kumar's wedding feast. They gave us special tokens when we asked for nonvegetarian food. You accepted this token? MAHA KALASH PUJA Get lost! I'll hit you with my shoe! Where's Trishul Daari? Uncle. Oh, it's my brother! Please tell the cops about our operation. What? I deflated the tires of the ambulance, the police jeep and all other vehicles. That's the reason they thrashed me. My knees are hurting! I knew it. He was acting as if he was 007. I already have enough problems on my plate! -Sir, please let him go! -Hey, get up! Buzz off! I'd rather die than live with you! -Okay, Uncle. -Bring the car around. Sorry, Uncle. I did not spare anyone. I have deflated our car's tires as well. Smart work. Oh, God! YASHODA RESIDENCE She's our child. Don't worry. She will be safe with us. Nitin was the first person to like and comment on every photo or video that I posted on Instagram. We became friends. He did a photo shoot for me. He told me that I am very beautiful. He said he will get me an acting job. We became lovers. He said he wanted to cut his birthday cake with me… and then I could leave for the Kalash Utsav. Happy birthday! -Ragini. -Yes? -Will you do something for me? -Yes. Tell me. Look… the person you are about to meet is a very eminent person. It would be perfect if you could just spend an hour with him. We'll have to struggle for 20-30 years if we want to live a settled life. Many people have used this opportunity and are now living decent lives. I am your boyfriend. I am telling you. Trust me. That's when… I saw his real face. She's a motherless child. I don't have the strength to fight them. She'll be alive only if she stays here. -Please calm down. -Only you can take care of her. It's alright. Oh, God! I just closed my eyes for two minutes and he married her. You said we'd be a joke if we didn't attend the festival. Now she has come back with us as a married woman! -Is this what you wanted? -Ganpat. You're the one who asked her to wear a sari! One man! Just one man! An entire town couldn't stop him! -Are you trying to praise your son-in-law? -Shut your mouth. Shut up or I will trash you! What? They're telecasting the wedding on TV?! Which channel? On National TV? Tell me the channel number. -B TV is on 42. Uttar TV is on 75. -They might put it on OTT as well. Wait… UTTAR TV The unison is blessed by the Gods They've added some background music as well, Uncle! It's me! And their gaze met Oh, no! They've ruined my family's reputation. But they've done a decent job. -Come here. -No way! Who the hell is constantly calling us? Who is it? I'll find out after I answer it! -Who is it? -Hello-- Father-in-law, it's me, your son-in-law. Which son-in-law? Who is this? I married your daughter this morning. It's me. Hey! Who the hell is it? Listen, he has high blood pressure. Hey! Alright, give the phone to Aarthi. Come here and say that to my face! Of course, I will! I'll pay you a formal visit. What is sir saying? -Sir? So much respect? -Yeah, what did he say-- What did he say? What did he say? Aarthi. How is Ragini? She is fine. -Don't worry. -Okay. Please make sure she is safe. She is blunt. And she is very sensitive. Boss has asked us to kill her. Prem. Tell me whatever you wanna eat. Don't blame me if you don't get it later. Uncle… Uncle… What? How will we solve the problems if everyone lazes around like you? We have 20-25 people. So? We need lunch, right? Hey, please just leave! I can't leave you like this. I have sent the boys. Do you want vegetarian or nonvegetarian food? What does your sister want? Mutton biryani, mutton sukka, chicken 65, chicken tandoori. -Do you want half or full? -Full. -I will take half. -Why didn't you tell me? The next is babycue. It's barbecue. -You glutton! -Get some extra pieces for me as well. God is not on my side. He has been actively humiliating me today. That's what happens when you sleep like a bear! Hey! Crazy fellow! -Hello. -Tell me. Go to the police station and file a complaint against him. -I will handle the rest. -Okay. May I order Chinese cuisine for you? Come with me, my dear doofus! -Half-mad idiot! -"Half-mad idiot." New word! -Uncle! -What's going on? Where are we going? Hey. -Tell me. -Four of you go to his house. -Okay. -I will tell you what to do. Don't worry about anything. We will handle it. Let's go. YASHODA RESIDENCE Boss, we are following him. It's Nitin. Answer it. Hello, Ragini? why weren't you answering my calls? You rogue! You scoundrel! What are you doing? Where are you? At the studio? Yes, I am at the studio. Come here and I'll explain-- Ragini? Hello? Boss, he is going to the collector's office. Hey! Why are you deviating? Do you want the honor of girls from your town to go viral on YouTube? Drop her off at the location I told you. If you don't… in an hour, the beauty of girls from your town will be displayed to the world. Brother, please. Hand me over to him. I don't want other girls to become his victims just for me. Don't worry. It won't happen. Boss, he has come to court. Silly fellow! He does not know that there's nothing that I can't buy for a price. He will understand soon. -Do you see what he has done? -Calm down. -Hey! -Pull your dhoti down. He escaped during the Kalash Utsav. Now he's been caught. I will summon him. Quick. The court will be closed for Dussehra from tomorrow. What can we do in two hours? -Just make sure he does not come in. -Alright. Ramesh! -Hi. -Isn't the judge here yet? -No. -Sit there. Sit here. Krishna Kumar. This is Inspector Farady. Yes, tell me. I want you to come to the station in five minutes. Bring the girl you took with you. Why? I am in court. You have humiliated a girl in public by marrying her. Her family is traumatized. We need to ask you some questions. Come here. GIVING OR TAKING A BRIBE IS A CRIME You stay here. People who are with me should never be afraid. Okay? No one can harm you. I married my wife. What's the problem, Michael Faraday? She'll be your wife when you officially tie the wedding chain around her neck. This marriage is invalid. How can she be your wife? How are people getting married these days? The husband puts the wedding chain around his wife's neck. Besides, we had registered our marriage first. We're doomed. -What's wrong? -Do you have proof of the registration? I will send it right now. But… -can I send it to you on WhatsApp? -Yes. Some useless fellows use a separate number for WhatsApp. That's the reason I asked. I have sent the photo. Please check. Who is Kadak Dhaarii? Inspector, his wife. She's his wife. Greetings. She has signed the papers as a witness. What did I do? What is he looking at? Your wife helped him put the wedding chain around her neck! I trusted you, and you have ruined my life! How dare you betray me! He is trying to hit me in front of you! Sorry, sir. We wasted your time. What does your name "Kadak Dhaarii" mean? -Well, sir-- -Sir… is it absolutely necessary to ask this right now? He's worried. I will tell you next time. Instead of the daughter, he should have followed his wife! Brother, here is some hot biryani. If you feel like laughing, you should. -Oh, no. -Bring the car around! -He has gone mad. -Restrain him. -I will restrain him. No… -I won't spare anyone! -Greetings, brother. -Come. They are inside. -Ragini. -Come. Let's go. Boss, the court will be closed for 15 days. -Sit. -We must protect her. We will handle it. Let's talk later. Brother, where is the jeep? Someone else took it. Do you want to meet your boyfriend? I don't even want to see his face. I know. That's the reason I thrashed him and dumped him in the car trunk. Let me go! Move! Videos! You love making videos! You cheat girls who trust you! I will kill you! Boss, he is inside. I am ready with our boys. I'll get him. You are telling me he's in court! How did he thrash and abduct Nitin if he's in court? What are you saying? You've ruined our family's reputation by getting pregnant before marriage! You're not allowed to come in! -Oh, God. -Why are you here? Haven't you humiliated us enough? Have you come here to humiliate us more? Hey, Kadak Dhaarii! -Everyone, please leave! -Please sit, sir. Didn't you hear the man? Get out! Or I will… You're touching his feet. Move. Why are you so angry? My son is a very nice boy. Who? The lawyer? Don't mention him! He humiliated me in public! -He touched our girl before marriage! -Yes! Is your son really a good man? -What? Are you talking about my son? -Yeah, of course! No way. It's impossible. My son would never stoop so low! Hey. Are they telling us the truth? Answer me. No, I lied to them. Did you hear that? We're talking about my son here. We've taught him to respect girls ever since he was a child. He knows how to treat a girl very well. Send your girl to our house with your blessings. We'll take care of her. He will cherish her presence. No one needs to cherish or celebrate anything. I am ready to remarry her and give her a new life even if she's pregnant. Damn you! Please bless her and drop her off at our house. We will take care of her. Come and drop her off?! Look… he has humiliated my husband! Humiliated! Look. He is hotheaded. He has lost his senses, he's blabbering, he's crying inconsolably. -He has humiliated my brother as well! -Yes. Everyone is mad at him. My house looks like a funeral home! I agree. How can we drop her off? -You think we have no self-respect? -Ask them! If you want, grab her hand and take her with you! No, sister! We cannot drop her off! We have pride, dignity and self-respect! -What do you say? -Hey! -What did you say? -Should we drop her off? I guess it would be wise. Can we keep an eye on her every day? What if she runs away with someone else? What will we do? That's it. Come with us, Aarthi. Come, dear. You are our daughter-in-law. I'll come with you only if my father asks me to. Are you coming or not? I will come only if my father asks me to. Alright, stay here. -Come, let's go. -Leave. Hey. The mother and her daughter are seasoned actors. She's willing to come. Take her. Come, dear. Baby. Baby! -Hey, Kadak Dhaarii. -Yes? I have just one question. Whose idea was it to say that she's pregnant? Mine. May you prosper. Give us your blessings. -God bless you. -God bless you. Hail Lord Shiva. God bless you. Dear… this house is of great importance. The doors to this house were locked 25 years ago. -We have never locked it ever since. -Here we go again. Someone is always around. We don't want anyone who comes to us for help to go back unattended. In this house-- The lamp should always be burning. It's a lamp of eternity. Krishna's younger sister always visits this house. Never let the guests leave without offering them something to eat. We must never divide the family under the pretext of dividing the wealth. Enough. You're smart. It's okay, dear? Did you hear that? -Dad-- -It's nothing. I was pretending to be normal in front of everyone, but the clock was ticking, and I was getting more and more restless. Why hasn't Nitin come home for two days? Auntie, I have sent him to Ooty for some work. He will be back in two days. Why can't he call his mother? Is he that busy? I'll ask him to call you. Prem! Hey. Where has he kept him? Ask the SP to find out his location without letting anyone know. Come, let's eat. -Welcome, mother-in-law. How are you? -I'm well. Please have a seat. Trishul. Father-in-law, please join us. If he doesn't get a formal invitation from the groom's family, my uncle won't even touch the food. Because… his pride is supreme. Father-in-law, I wish to touch your feet. Please give me your blessings! Please sit. -Take your seats! -Hurry! Come on, sit. Stop eating like an animal! You taught me that. Just shut up and eat. Had I not forced you to come with me to the Maha Kalash Puja, none of this would have happened. You must insist on not going to the Kalash Puja. He'll force you to go with him. What if he says that we don't have to come? We will have to kidnap her from the house. Kidnapping her from the temple is Plan A. Kidnapping her from the house is Plan B. And what if Dad's home? We'll have to nab him first. That's Plan C. Correct? For safety, let's get our marriage registered. -Now that's a lawyer speaking. -It's okay, dear. So, you've used all the techniques. -Good job. -You must find a bride for me as well. -Have some gravy. --Ciao! Ciao! -Ciao! Ciao! -Ciao! Ciao! -Ciao! Ciao! -You'll choke if you keep singing! -Ciao! -Ciao! -Aarthi! -Yes? The gravy is superb. I didn't know you were such a good cook. -This is the best meal I've ever had! -Right, Dad! Great! Henceforth, you'll only get the food she cooks. Mom… Good night, father-in-law. -Good night, dear. -Good night… -Son. -Yes? Can you please massage my feet? You were raving about the food, right? Go. Give her a massage now. -Oh, that's what this is about! -Why are you getting jealous? I have been toiling hard for this family every day for years. Oh, God. The relief I feel when my son massages my feet… Don't stop. -Is this the spot? -Yes, it is. This will give you relief. I didn't hear from my beloved I am waiting I didn't hear from my beloved I am waiting Mom… Mom. Dad… Go on! Son! Please massage my hands. Yashoda, this is too much. What? Didn't you complement our daughter-in-law's cooking? Come and do this! Mom… Mom… Go. I will ask your dad to do it. Come here. -Thanks, Dad. -I'm waiting. Darn my luck! Hi, darling. My feet hurt a lot. What? Why? Won't you massage my feet? I never said that. It's a boon to massage someone's feet. Especially, my wife's feet. I'm gonna get a million blessings for doing it. Your silk kurta takes my breath away I am waiting for you I can hear my heart pound It's yearning for you The relationship we share is sweet My heart begins to pound Every time you get closer You send my heart racing Lose your heart to me, beloved I can feel the rhythm I can feel the rhythm I can feel the rhythm I can feel the rhythm I can feel the rhythm Your silk kurta takes my breath away I am waiting for you Hey, I can hear my heart pound It's yearning for you The relationship we share is sweet You are a beauty And I can't stop admiring you You are a diva, my love Our unison will be passionate Time will come to a standstill I will arrive with wedding guests And I will take my bride away I will wait for you With open arms You are my cute queen When I'm with you, I'm drenched in love rain Shall I kiss you so tight that… I can feel the rhythm I can feel the rhythm I can feel the rhythm Your silk kurta takes my breath away I am waiting for you I can hear my heart pound It's yearning for you The relationship we share is sweet My heart begins to pound Every time you get closer You send my heart racing Lose your heart to me, beloved I can feel the rhythm I can feel the rhythm I can feel the rhythm I can feel the rhythm I can feel the rhythm I can feel the rhythm Malathi! Did you see it? Did you see how they're enjoying a dead girl's video? So many views! So many comments! So many likes! -Hey! -A new video coming soon. -Enjoy. -You rascal! Why are you torturing me? I don't know if it's day or night. I can't hear any sound! I don't like to waste time. I'm giving you five minutes. Tell us everything. If you don't… we will kill you. Hey… forget about five minutes, I won't tell you anything even if you give me five years. Let me go! No! Stop! I will tell you everything! Let me go! I will tell you the truth! I will tell you! Go ahead. First… we identify our targets and trap them in love. Then we threaten them, intimidate them, and record their videos. We seduce them by saying that we will pay them and they can enjoy their life. If they agree to it, we let them go. But those who resist… we kill them and pass it off as an accident. One of our guys takes the couples' phones, travels to Madhya Pradesh, Mumbai, Punjab, and dumps the phones and SIM cards at different places. Police try tracing the phones' location, but they never find it. Their last known location was in Maharashtra. We talk to their family members and pretend to be local villagers. We provoke them to commit suicide. Krishna, someone instigated him to take his life. Rascal! We shouldn't spare them. We should drag them all to court. They should be hanged. Their punishment… must act as a deterrent for people with such cruel motives. The rage that's within me is asking me to finish him off. But… Great men are always bad men. Prem is not just one man. It's a huge network. Instead of getting angry for what they did to my loved ones, I must keep calm and fight for many unknown girls who are trapped in this mess. I want to go deep into its roots and flush them out. What happened to Prem's wife? His wife and driver had eloped. They had run off to Maharashtra. They have been untraceable ever since. Her father is still looking for her. His phone's location shows that he's only been to his house and the court, sir. The court is closed for a few days. Why would he visit it frequently? Hi, Krishna. -Hello. -Did you have your lunch? Did you drink water? Did you urinate? Hey. Drink lots of water. Make sure you're peeing on time. How was the food? The food was fantastic. You did a great job. If my mom's food is rated six, your food can be rated seven. Thank you, dear. Seven! Oh, Lord of the seven hills! Oh, no! -Miss you, dear. -Miss you too. -Listen. -Yes? Why is that hen pecking so much? Let's make a curry with it. -Greetings. -Hey! How are you? -How are things? -Everything is fine. A wife is the Lord's blessing… She resides in my heart The caller tune has changed. It's okay. Just a minute. Yes, Mom? -Mom. -You have changed Mom's song. Mom's song? Oh, the caller tune? What's it now? It says, "A wife is a boon from God." No, Mom. I promise I did not change it. You've called me but you haven't asked me if I've eaten yet. Your wife already asked you everything that usually I ask. You heard it? I'm gonna knock that hen down. Hello? Boss is struggling to strike a balance between his wife and mother. -No one's ever been able to do that. -Correct. Krishna Kumar. Who is this? They have shot a hot video right now. At your house. You'll find it hard to believe. I should just release it. -I'm sure it's gonna be viral. -Hey! -I will kill you! -Hey. Check your WhatsApp. Aarthi, what happened? Aarthi! Oh, God! Hello. You thought -I couldn't get to your wife, right? -I'll kill you! Hey! Where are you? -My name is Prem, kid. -I'm going to kill you! -Aarthi, open the door! -Open up, dear! Oh, God! I hope she doesn't hurt herself. Aarthi. Try calling her. Aarthi. Aarthi! I want to see you. Please open the door. No… Calm down. It'll be alright. Look at me. It'll be alright. Don't cry. Listen to me. I saw the video. The world might see it soon. I will try my best to stop it… from coming out. But if it does come out… -I will die. -Hey. Aarthi. Aarthi. Hey, is my Aarthi a coward? Don't get scared. You must overcome this. Nude! The video will surface soon. Many people will see it. Many of them will share it. "Wonderful", "bad", this is what some scoundrels will comment on it. "Can I get the full video link?" This is how some of them will plead. Not a single person will say… "Delete the video." The neighbors, the people in the area, the whole town will look at me differently. "The girl whose video went viral." They will gossip about it. But will they talk about the guy who posted the video? Will they scold him? If a girl is sexually abused… they say that she must have provoked him. If she is raped, they say that she must have dressed provocatively. We only talk about the victim. Do you think they talk about the perpetrator of the crime? This village only has… a mouth, but no ears. It won't hear anything. Even if they laugh at something else, I will end up thinking that they are laughing at me. Forget about me. My father? Do you think he can step out? You… Can you go to the office? The man who did this should be mortified. His family should be ashamed. But you, the girl who isn't at fault, is trembling in shame and hiding in a room. The man who hid and recorded the video… his family should be trembling in shame, right? They think women are weak. We need to show them the power of women. The construct that a woman is nothing without her modesty is absolutely rubbish! A woman's body… is not an object of obscenity. You must be the first one to speak against it! "Your perversion… is a lot more obscene than my body." That's what the united voice of the girls must say! Our fear is their strength. Aarthi… I believe you will be a role model to all the girls. The beauty of a girl lies in her courage and confidence. Be courageous! You are not alone. We will stand with you. Me, Dad, Mom, and our whole family! Listen, dear. You're a strong girl. You must be brave! We will stand with you. Okay? Who are you? I am here for the annual CCTV maintenance. They are brutal! We shouldn't spare them! I will kill them and go to jail! I am ready. He has sent a video. Connect it. Brothers and sisters… I am Aarthi. You must have seen a video. The girl in the video isn't me. They have morphed it with CGI. I'm not gonna sit here and spew these lies. I am the girl in that video. Advocate Krishna Kumar's wife. I would've been ashamed if I was at fault. They hid cameras in my home and recorded me when I was taking a bath, and when I was with my husband! The ones who recorded those videos must be ashamed! Their parents should be ashamed. The ones who released it, shared it and liked it should be ashamed! Why should I be ashamed? This is not emotional… it's educational. The guy who recorded my video is Anand, the owner of PK Hotel. Prem, she has used a picture of my family! The one who asked him to do it is Prem, the son of a Central Minister. They are responsible for the deaths of Uncle Govind's family and Moni. My family! Sir, that's my family! We are going to court. We'll gladly accept the court's and the people's judgment. Now, I'll give you some time. Give me every single video you have before the court's vacation ends. If you don't… You had promised you'd do something, right? I will do the same to you! Prem! Fear and regret… are worse than failure. Does he have the proof to back his claim? Prem… him having proof is not the problem! If this video surfaces, everyone's gonna start speaking up. If I want to win this case, I need proper evidence and witnesses. I've started gathering it. Gather all the victims. They will be our key witnesses. Women have a bad habit. We don't speak up when we need to and speak when it's unnecessary. That creates difficulties for us. I asked Dad and my father-in-law… to file a complaint on behalf of Aarthi at the local police station. I cannot accept this complaint. Leave. I tried filing a complaint at the SP office in person. Ask him to come next week. Tell him I am not here. They made me wait for hours. Finally, he refused to meet me. Fighting this case is a huge challenge for a lawyer like me. How can an ordinary person fight it? I met a senior lawyer, who is currently a judge and a family friend. My well-wisher, Mrs. Vijaya Chandrashekhar. Sir, it's me, the inspector. The lawyer has filed a complaint at the CM cell. The DGP has issued an order to file an FIR. The boys who are with him have made some silly mistakes. My son's name is on the list as well. Please look into it and handle it. I don't want to hear a word about it in the press and the media. I'm willing to testify in court. But Aarthi and Ragini won't be able to get away. Prem will finish them. The SP is on the line. Tell me. We've found Nitin's location. Well done. We were careless. What's wrong? They have abducted Nitin. Nitin? The two girls who were willing to testify in court have been abducted as well. Tighten the screws! You cannot go to court. If you do, I will release all the videos! If you try to testify against us… She's in the hospital. They have intimidated everyone. We don't need anyone. Aarthi can do it. Ragini… you should stay out of it as well. You have a life of your own. What? You called me your sister, right? Was that a lie, brother? My brother is fighting for a good cause. Why can't I stand with him? I will stand with you! I don't care who's against us! TRUTH ALONE TRIUMPHS Case number 307/19. The petitioner is Aarthi. The defendant is Prem. I have listed Prem's name as the primary accused in this case. He furnished a medical certificate and did not come to court. Proceed. Central Minister Bhairav Singh's son, Prem, and his associates record obscene videos of several women and use those to threaten them into sleeping with eminent people. Audio clips, WhatsApp screenshots of Prem threatening me have been submitted to the honorable court. She is an honest judge. We've won half the battle if she's the one hearing this case. The defense may present its case. Your Honor, in the current case, the petitioner's husband, Krishna Kumar, has always been a science and IT protégé. This is a commonly known fact. He uses technology to unlock cars without their keys! He has used his prowess to hack into Mr. Prem's phone. He has placed some images on Mr. Prem's phone without his knowledge through WhatsApp. You Honor… this is a vile attempt to tarnish Mr. Prem's image. Why hasn't a single one of the "many victims" testified against him? This man is using his wife to settle personal scores! You're an esteemed judge, Your Honor. I would like to call another esteemed personality, Professor Raj Verma to the witness box. I am a professor at Mr. Prem's not-for-profit NEET coaching center. People think Mr. Prem is a businessman. But in my eyes, he's a philanthropist. His philanthropy has changed the lives of many students. Some have government jobs and some have settled in foreign countries. Records of the coaching center. -Listen. -Yes, sir? -Go and check that area. -Check over there. You've abducted Nitin! Where is he? What's going on? Comb through their house. -Sir, please take off your shoes. -Go! I would like to submit the testimony of Mr. Nitin, who was Mr. Prem's associate. One day, we were using cocaine. I have tried every single drug in the world! There's nothing that I haven't tried. From a 100-rupee pill to a 25-lakh-rupee bottle, I've tried it all! The drugs… Cocaine, Speed, Ketamine, Bendzedrine, I've tried it all! Then… the women! All ages! From 16 to 60! Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra, Karnataka… From all countries, and all religions and colors! Prem's wife found out about his vices. He killed his wife, sir. But he cooked up a story about her eloping with a driver. He killed the driver as well. I request the honorable judge, under section 327 of the CRPC, to have the victims' testimonies recorded in the judge's private chambers as a part of the "In-camera proceedings". This is my humble request. Alright. But where is your witness, Mr. Nitin? Sir, there's a corpse in the backyard! You are trapped! -What's this? -Sir-- You killed Nitin and hid his body in the trunk! -Nitin! -Prem, please save me. -Are you gonna testify against me? -No, Prem… Sorry, Your Honor. But this is really important. Nitin! Vasudev Rai is a killer. Don't spare him! Tear his place down! Krishna Kumar has coerced me into recording my statement. He has tied me up. He is torturing me. Every single statement I've made in that video is false! Please save me if you see this, Prem. Krishna Kumar will kill me if you don't! This is a temple. Please don't destroy it! I beg you! I beg you! Please! This house is like a temple! How dare you kill my friend and call your home a temple! No! Help! Don't break it! This case is dismissed. Mr. Krishna Kumar has wasted our precious time by trying to mislead the court. He presented false evidence to the court. So, this court orders Mr. Krishna Kumar and his father Mr. Vasudev Rai to remand and present facts to the court. Please, he is an old man. Don't hit him! Vasudev! There are chances that the evidence and eyewitnesses can be manipulated. And hence, the court hereby orders… That the accused must be arrested and their actions must be investigated. KRISHNA KUMAR AND HIS FATHER HAVE BEEN ARRESTED -Cheers! -Cheers! Are you saying it is futile to file an appeal in the high court? We'll be out on bail tomorrow. We can go home. I'm a lawyer. But I couldn't… Sorry, Dad. You had to stay here for two months. It doesn't matter. I'd be happy to stay here for two years if it means that our girls will be safe out there. But they won't let that happen. Are you going to wear the coat… or the dhoti? Tell me, SP sir. He has nabbed five people. And my officer Micheal Faraday. You are under arrest. Professor Raj Verma. RAJ VERMA And three boys from your team. -Open the door! -Let us go! You could be his next target. Be careful! -Let us go! -Open the door! I don't want anyone to hear their voices. Let us go! Mr. Serviceman! You must have realized the sway I hold. I can ruin many lives, spoil their images. And I'm going to do that. I'll start with your wife! I am going to release the videos of 500 girls. You can try and talk about it "positively"… but women are the weaker sex! But I have a deal for you. Bring my boys to me and… save yourself and the girls from your town. I will give you all the videos. If you don't, I'm willing to go to extreme lengths to get what I want! You shouldn't waste your time. You have 20 minutes. -Anish! -Sir? Start uploading all the videos. Hello? Brother, they are calling me from different numbers… and are threatening me by saying that they want to talk about the videos. I am really scared! He has sent me the video! Please save me! Brother! He has sent my video to my brother. And the scoundrel captioned it as "Enjoy"! Chhutki! -Dad! -Leave my sister alone! Dad! Brother! Brother! Dad! Dad! Chhutki! Dad! Chhutki! Dad! Dad! Dad! Kill him, Prem! You think you can play with the law just because you're a lawyer?! Anish. Play the video. Let him check it. You must've received it on your phone. Watch it. There's no internet. Why? Didn't you pay the bill? Can you check if yours works? The WiFi as well as my mobile network isn't working. Jammer? That's alright. I have it on my phone. The "Celebrating Women" festival! What are you gonna do? No one is gonna marry any girl from your town! I am scared, brother. Please save me, brother. Brother! Brother! Don't spare them, brother! Pervert! You ogle women with these eyes! These eyes! Hey! Today's judgment day! Quick! Look. Have a good look! -My son… -Look what your children have achieved! What happened? -Who hit you? -Anand! How can you hit my son? What has he done? A father is not someone who gives birth to the child. The one who raises the son is a father! He's not human. He's a monster! He's a murderer! Don't trust him! Please thrash him! Shameless man! I will kill you! Stop screaming! Please, I'm begging! Please let me go! -You can't leave. -I need to go. Take off your clothes! Just do it! You'll regret it if you don't follow my orders! Please don't hit me. Take your clothes off! Okay, I'll do it. The scoundrel in this video… is your blood. Does that make you happy? You raise your boys by telling them, "Boys shouldn't cry." Instead, you should tell them that they shouldn't make girls cry. This… perversion… They have similar videos of more than 500 girls, sir. They have destroyed many families. But… they have a friend in the police department. We send our girls to schools and colleges to study. But predators like him have ruined the lives of many girls! And he's rewarded for his deeds! He's known as an "honorable teacher". If people supposed to protect our girls are evil, how do we send our girls out? My sister was nine years old when… two brutal beasts just like them killed her. My family has not recovered from the trauma. We still believe that she is living with us. We still buy her clothes, offer her food, and live like she's here with us. If you keep inflicting such cruelty, how can you expect the parents to move on? "Justice for Saraswathi!", "Justice for Vimala!" These aren't just hashtags meant to be discussed online! These men must be scared! We will try arguing and fighting this in court. But they will seek adjournments and they’ll keep evading us! Because we might know the law, but they know the loopholes! Vicky! Vicky! I came here because I trusted you. Who asked you to trust us? -Why are you doing this to me? -She was as old as you are. -She studied with you. -Please let me go! He told her that he loved her. But he betrayed her and then he… He recorded this video, and he and the group… Please! It hurts! They gang-raped her. -Please let me go! -Dude, how was it? These girls are regretting the fact that they were born as females. She's just a 19-year-old child for her parents! She must've had many dreams! Her parents are traumatized! They're scared of this video. And he sent the video to her brother. Oh, God! What should I do to your brother? Tell me. Why did you do this? Look at our father. He is such a nice man. He doesn't even enter my room without knocking on the door! He's hanging his head in shame! Look at Mom! She was always proud to have a son like you! Savitri. She's wailing and crumbling! It's humiliating to call you my brother! If they pay you, will you place a camera in my room as well? You lecherous beast! You shouldn't even be alive! Are you out of your mind? Hey! Sir, she killed him! -No! -What did you do? I am sorry, Dad! He didn't deserve to live. He's a disgrace to society. Brother, please tell the girls that I've apologized on behalf of my brother. Tell them our family is hanging our heads in shame! This animal has turned me into a murderer. He has ruined my life and my dreams! You did not commit this murder. I, your brother, did it. Krishna, you know me. I have been a teacher for 25 years. I have created many doctors and engineers. Really? Is that all you have done? Fifty-seven girls. They were all as shy as you in the beginning. -No, sir. -But marks, jobs, campus… They got it all and are living like queens today. -Are you getting me? -Please, I won't do it, sir. Please, sir! Leave me alone. I don't care about the others! I have raised my son well! I won't let him die! He might have made a mistake. But who are you to punish him? Hey! Come, let's go. Get up! -Where are you going? Come here! -Stop! You think your son's not like them?! He's the one who roped me in and brought the whole plan to this stage! -Hey! -Sit down! Please stop! Oh, God! -You killed him! -Hey! Hey! I have always strived to be an honest cop. I've never accepted a bribe in my life. But because of this beast… I've committed a sin. And I deserve to die. This statement says that Krishna Kumar kidnapped your daughter. Sign it or I'll file a case of prostitution against your daughter. -Dad! -Dad, save me! -I can't kill him. He's my son! -Dad, don't do it. -But please kill this sinner! -Dad, please don't! -Dad… -You are dead to me! Dad… Please… Father-in-law! Thank you. Thank you for coming! Please save me. Shoot him. Blow his head off! I'll shoot him. I'll slay this demon. Shoot him! Damn it! Shoot him! Can you place this gun… on Prem's forehead, Krishna Kumar. Father-in-law, what are you saying? Sir? I have weak eyesight. You don't believe it, right? My daughter used to help me. Daddy, left. Daddy, right. Great job, Daddy! No one's gonna know! She meant everything to me. You ruined her image in public. She was pregnant. How could you kill her? Great men are all-- Krishna Kumar… In court, it's the judge who orders the execution of criminals. Is the judge committing a murder? No, right? You've done the same thing. People usually run away from these problems. Some men with a big heart come forward to fight it. Not everyone… can bear the weight of being that man. God bless you, Krishna Kumar. I understand the value of life. But it was important to kill them so that they would not destroy any more lives. I can't watch them get humiliated by the cops, the courts, and the news channels. Police! Open it! The cops are here. I've committed all these murders. Please leave. Forgive me. I am proud to be your assistant. Take them. Use the back door. Let's go, ma'am. Please! The police are here. Come on! Hey, break the door down! You have murdered people! I prayed to the Lord for seven years for a child! Why did you do this? I didn't commit a crime, Mom. It was just a cleanup. Sir… Krishna! Do something! Krishna… Brother. Brother! Don't arrest! Don't arrest! Don't arrest our brother! Don't arrest! Don't arrest! Don't arrest our brother! -Don't arrest! Don't arrest! -Don't arrest! Don't arrest! -Don't arrest our brother! -Don't arrest our brother! -Don't arrest! Don't arrest! -Don't arrest! Don't arrest! -Don't arrest our brother! -Don't arrest our brother! -Don't arrest! Don't arrest! -Don't arrest! Don't arrest! You have gifted a good son to this soil, Yashoda. -Don't arrest! Don't arrest! -Don't arrest! Don't arrest! Don't arrest Krishna Kumar! -Don't arrest! Don't arrest! -Don't arrest! Don't arrest! -Don't arrest Krishna Kumar! -Don't arrest Krishna Kumar! -Don't arrest! Don't arrest! -Don't arrest! Don't arrest! -Don't arrest Krishna Kumar! -Don't arrest Krishna Kumar! -Don't arrest! Don't arrest! -Don't arrest! Don't arrest!
